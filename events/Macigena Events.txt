Thus the term 'Grand Mules' denotes the same for Macigena (There are four: Zekuris, Tatam, Diawadou and Katoucha). In this event, the Prophet meets with his sister Safinata and the rest of the three major clan chiefs to discuss the upcoming war - Informing them that there will unfortunately be bloodshed, but that they shall be rewarded for their services both in this world and in the afterlife.

Basically by most definitions in the Revelead Texts, the various Mystics of the city of Zao are technically heathens. Ochen, being what is effectively a Mystic himself and the founder of what is more or less zebra Sufism wants to integrate them and use their talents for the sake of glorifying God, aka integrate them into the Zariqate, his sister on the other hand who has an almost slavish dedication to the concept of moral law wants to punish them for their part in glorifying amoral behaviour (The punishment is mostly just lashings). Both of them use the Revealed Texts to back up their words and it is ultimately up to the Prophet to decide upon the matter - Entire event should have the style of a debate.

The Prophet for his part tries to explain that sometimes there is a need to Struggle against the evil of others for the Community to have a chance at a faithful and happy life. Ultimately his son comes away satisifed with the explanation, but the entire interaction leaves a bad taste in the Prophet's mouth.

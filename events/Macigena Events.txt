country_event = { #TODO - Brief event with the Prophet remembering his dead wife Aissata (Died of a lung infection in 982 while the Prophet was still a scholar and bureaucrat in Ziani) - Overall it's meant to be a sweet event where he remembers the good times, followed by his subsequent depression and Godly revelation (Implied to be what is effectively a mental breakdown), and the past 20 or so years of resistance with his fellow Macigena people against whoever sought to subjugate their homeland (He fled the capital in 987 after an arrest warrant was issued against him for preaching against the Manza)

country_event = { #TODO - Second event that follows the first intro event immediately. The Prophet banishing his doubts and holding a sermon to his assorted followers (Includes the generals and his children alongside their followers and the populace of Mareshi) in which he declares what is more or less a Fatwa against the decadent leaders and greedy clergy of the Great Lakes, ending his speech with a promise that the time has come to free the Great Lakes from the decadence of the past.

country_event = { #TODO - Before I give the TODO here, a brief term explanation. The name of the event is a play on the Bedouin term 'The Great Skulls of Arabia' which denotes the great aka the most powerful clans of Arabia. Thus the term 'Grand Mules' denotes the same for Macigena (There are four: Zekuris, Tatam, Diawadou and Katoucha). In this event, the Prophet meets with his sister Safinata and the rest of the three major clan chiefs to discuss the upcoming war - Informing them that there will unfortunately be bloodshed, but that they shall be rewarded for their services both in this world and in the afterlife. For their part, the Chiefs are fully loyal to him.

}

country_event = { #TODO - A quiet event between the Prophet and his daughter Zulaihat where they're sitting around in his modest home and drinking tea. Overall it's just a father and his daughter discussing life, with the Prophet giving sagely advice and in the end asking his child to give him judgement on whether she believes that his goal of waging war for what he perceives as a just war - To his surprise Zulihalit believes that not only is it just, backign up her words with scripture (Hadiths) from the Revealed Texts (Think, mix between the Quran and the Bible), but that it is a necessity.

country_event = { #TODO - The Prophet quietly observing a Sufi-esque performance by his son Ochen and his Zariqa Order (Effectively a Sufi order), it's effectively the Community's take upon the Griot traditions of the Great Lakes, with the entire ceremony involving a lot of music, the channeling of spirits to prove one's mastery over the self and frenzied exaltations of God. For his part, the Prophet is proud of his son for having found such a beautiful use of his oratory and musical arts, recognising the importance such public displays have upon a people's morale in times of hardship.

country_event = { #TODO - With the defeat of Zar-Hay, it's found out Zonni was killed in the fighting and as such the Prophet is brought before his corpse to pass judgement - The offer to burn his body on a pyre is presented, but the Prophet ultimately decides that Zonni was righteous in life and although a heathen deserves a proper burial mound as per is tradition for people not of the Community. Ultimately this is meant to be a show of respect towards the fallen Warlord.

country_event = { #TODO - The first event in which we see a crack in the relationship between Ochen and Zulaihat. Basically by most definitions in the Revelead Texts, the various Mystics of the city of Zao are technically heathens. Ochen, being what is effectively a Mystic himself and the founder of what is more or less zebra Sufism wants to integrate them and use their talents for the sake of glorifying God, aka integrate them into the Zariqate, his sister on the other hand who has an almost slavish dedication to the concept of moral law wants to punish them for their part in glorifying amoral behaviour (The punishment is mostly just lashings). Both of them use the Revealed Texts to back up their words and it is ultimately up to the Prophet to decide upon the matter - Entire event should have the style of a debate.

country_event = { #TODO - The Prophet, having gathered a crowd in the city of Zao after proving his benevolence essentially giving a speech about unifying the Great Lakes. It is a generally fiery speech denouncing the decadence and amoral behaviour of the other polities in the region - The entire speech ends with the Prophet being given the crown of Zar-Hay by Issa and dashing it upon the ground, proclaiming that there is no king but God, and that the Community shall act as the stewards and custodians of his realm.

Overall, this is meant to be a nice little event of Issa meeting with Kelece (Ask Augenis for details on who he is) and effectively convincing him to convert and work for the Prophet/Custodianship as they do actually have the region's best interests in mind.

Mildest sentence most people get is being flogged publically, eventually they get to the Gold Bug (Legranx) himself (Ask Augenis for details if need be), in spite of some begging, it's fairly obvious that the only thing he's getting is the death sentence.

This event is more meant to show the Prophet meeting with the leader of one such servile clan and offering them the same respect he would to any other person showing just how much simple kindness and a smidge of charisma have allowed him to gather such a large following.

The Prophet for his part tries to explain that sometimes there is a need to Struggle against the evil of others for the Community to have a chance at a faithful and happy life. Ultimately his son comes away satisifed with the explanation, but the entire interaction leaves a bad taste in the Prophet's mouth.

 ### FOCUS ###

 #Intro Focuses#
 YAN_solid_chaos:0 "The Zebridean Situation"
 YAN_solid_chaos_desc:0 "Ever since the Feathisian economy went into a recession, the Zebrides have been left adrift. The economy, which always was focused on providing for Feathisia's needs, has been sent into a tailspin, and the locals have become more and more unruly. Governor-General Dirk Loterijen has his work cut out for him if he hopes to restore order."
 YAN_calm_revoltists:0 "Targeted Arrests" #lower stability
 YAN_calm_revoltists_desc:0 "The independence movement, the "Kebangkitan" in the local language, is a many-headed beast, but there are loopholes in the justice system that would permit a more proactive approach to dealing with their leaders. Maybe it is to read the code of laws like Maar reads the sacred texts, but it is necessary for the sake of stability." 
 YAN_gather_forces:0 "Gather our forces"
 YAN_gather_forces_desc:0 "If this situation explodes, there will be blood in the streets. Hopefully it can be avoided, but Loterijen has no interest in dealing with maybes. Thankfully, the administration can still count upon the loyalty of some of the locals. If the situation detonates, this will come in handy."
 YAN_powers_of_governor:0 "Powers of the Governor" 
 YAN_powers_of_governor_desc:0 "This situation can not be dealt with under the normal legal framework, and Loterijen has written to the Feathisian Parliament to request emergency powers in order to deal with his crisis. The question is just whether the parliament will have the stomach to do what is necessary."
 YAN_industrial_spending:0 "Industrial Investment" #pp loss, maybe some political influence, he's making concessions to the lineages
 YAN_industrial_spending_desc:0 "The Kirin have been on these islands for centuries, and their "lineages" - extended families stretching dozens of generations back - are the single most economically influential in the region. They are also as deceitful as they are canny, and yet Loterijen needs whatever backing he can get. He simply has to hope that the snakes will be too fat and happy to strike."
 YAN_gathersupport:0 "Gather Support" #bit hefty bonuses
 YAN_gathersupport_desc:0 "If the isles would fall to the revolutionaries it would simply mean one elite being replaced with another, and the Loterijen administration is working hard to ensure that this fact is not lost on those who might end up disadvantaged if the Feathisian authority collapses."
 YAN_dire_news:0 "The Griffonian Crisis"
 YAN_dire_news_desc:0 "When it rains, it pours, and this holds doubly true for these accursed islands. With the news out of Griffonia, everything is coming to a head faster than anygriff hoped for. The Administration is bracing itself, hoping for the best and fearing the worst."

 ###Generic Events###
 YANintro.1.t:0 "The Colonial Govenror" #Note, this takes place two DAYS after the first focus is completed.  #Loterijen
 YANintro.1.d:0 ""...and though the local tax base has remained largely intact, the absent economic support from Feathisia has left our budget to shrink with almost fifteen percent," the director finished his report."Thankfully, our budget remains balanced thanks to the austerity programs carried out through the last fiscal year, though the cuts have left a large part of the local population without access to most if not all government programs."\n\n"A temporary issue," Governor-General Dirk Loterijen said from his position at the short end of the table. The old vulture clasped his claws together as he leaned forward. "With the recent crisis, a lot of the smaller farmers are being targeted by larger interests to sell their lands. We should instituted a land purchase tax for now, which we can spin as something good to keep the lower classes on our side. Also, fix the tariffs for independent trading at three percent and sell the merchants something about predictability and stability. Those who are receptive can be given reduced rates on what we can still export, in return for a percentage of their profit upon sale. Lastly, appeal to Feathisia once again for a crisis package. Yes?" he continued, lifting an eyebrow at the director, who suddenly frowned.\n\n"Are we appealing to Feathisia for aid, while still skirting their preferential trade position, then?" the director asked for clarification, seemingly hesitating. \n\n"We are doing what we must to ensure this colony doesn't collapse," Loterijen explained, "Nothing of it is illegal, I extracted the parliament's personal confirmation of that a long time ago, and if they disapprove of my actions they can inform me of this after the crisis is handled. Any more questions?"\n\n"No sir," the director said, bowing his head and leaving, leaving Loterijen to rise out of his seat and walk towards the balcony where he looked out across the city of Beakavia. Tomorrow would be the twenty-fifth anniversary of his governorship. Twenty five years stuck on these blasted islands for the crime of ambition. Reaching into his desk, he took out a bottle of brandy and a glass."
 YANintro.1.a:0 "They won't be able to say I didn't do my job, at least."

 YANintro.2.t:0 "A Distant Thunder"
 YANintro.2.d:0 "The three young zebras were running up and down the stairs to the massive temple complex as fast as they could, sweat pouring down their faces as they struggled with the heavy bags of rocks on their backs. They were exhausted, and would have stopped to rest, were it not for the scarred old zebra - the Grand Tuan of the temple himself, Orangtua Yangmarah, sitting at the top of the stairs, watching them with a cane in his hooves. As they turned around and began down again, the Grand Tuan glanced back to see a newcomer approach from the main entrance, a kirin in griffonian clothing. The newcomer came up to him and kneeled deeply before sitting down by his side.\n\n"Rowdy disciples?" the Kirin asked and Yangmarah nodded.\n\n"Some take their duties seriously, some draw rude symbols in the dirt they are meant to sweep," the old zebra replied with a raspy voice.\n\n"Your grace, I once again plead with you to depart Pulalap," the kirin continued, "The Kebangkitan is growing stronger each day, the Feathisians are weakening. We could have risen up already, but we need your leadership! You are the only one who can bring everycreature together under you."\n\n"We could have risen up, and we would have died," the old zebra replied. "It is not yet time, even though the moment is drawing close. The Feathisians' grip on our lands are growing weaker each day, that is true, but action begets reaction. If we push too fast, too hard, they will rally to defend what is 'theirs'. That is why we must remain everpresent, but peaceful. Let them live with the tiger's glare fixed on them, but never give them cause to take to arms. The fangs will come in due time, and when it does, their grip will have withered away."\n\n"I understand, your grace..." the kirin said reluctantly. "Also should they still be running?" he continued, noticing how one of the students had fallen down from exhaustion. Yangmarah simply took his cane and whipped it against the stairs, making the young zebra climb to his feet in near panic at the sound and continue to run."
 YANintro.2.a:0 "It is all about motivation."

 YANintro.3.t:0 "A Dinner Party" #Kudakelasi
 YANintro.3.d:0 "The party was going well, with a murmur of conversations and music filling the air along with the smell of food and perfume. Hundreds of kirin from each of the four great lineages were gathered, and everycreature seemeed in a cheerful mood as they talked and laughed; at least if one only looked on the surface. There was more than one dance being carried out tonight, and Kudakelasi Sopan was enjoying herself immensely."\n\n"And what of the new tariffs?" she asked the young scion of the Tegas lineage after finally having managed to corner him. "It must be so hard on your people, are you doing all right?"\n\n"It is not too bad," the young colt assured her, "being able to predict costs across the board is helpful, and at least the Feathisians are amenable if you are amenable in return."\n\n"That's so good to hear!" Kudakelasi said in relief, "But is that awful Governor-General giving you a fair deal?"\n\n"The prices are excellent, all he asks is that you pay a percentage of your profits afterwards!" the young kirin nodded, making Kudakelasi smile and kiss his cheeks."\n\n"Your parents would be proud of you," she said before noticing something, "Oh my, isn't that young lady Mawar Pandai?" she asked coyly, looking to the young Tegas, "don't think I haven't heard of your 'trips'. But don't let me keep you, please," she said, half nudging the young boy towards the girl further away, smiling after them before turning around, her smile dropping."\n\n"Anggrek?" she asked quietly, her servant coming up silently by her side. "The Feathisians are getting their claws into some of the Tegas," Kudakelasi told her. "Make sure their patriarch is informed. Also, buy up what the Feathisians want us to sell on their behalf, undercut the other lineages if you have to, and sell it on at a minimal profit."\n\nWordlessly, Anggrek obeyed and departed just as Kudakelasi smiled to greet another old friend."    
 YANintro.3.a:0 "It's so nice to see you again!"
 
 YANintro.4.t:0 "Deep in the Jungles" #Semuakawan
 YANintro.4.d:0 "Deep inside the Wezulian jungles, the drums were roaring across the temple courtyard, with dozens of zebras and kirin both watching the scene in front of them in silence, where the lone griffon stood surrounded by half a dozen zebras and kirin, all of them dressed in black. At a sudden stop in the music, one of the zebras attacked the griffon, only to find himself faceplanting as the griffon sidestepped his blow, tripped him up and slammed his face into the earth. Turning up as one of the kirin came at him, he parried several rapid blows and kicks before countering, giving her a gut-punch the bowled her over.\n\nOne after one, the attackers fell, until in the end only the griffon remained standing and the scarred priest that had overseen it all rose up, raising one hoof to stop the music.\n\n"Cakarkeluli Semuakawan," he spoke, the griffon bowing his head before him. "You came here to prove yourself, and you have done so beyond any shadow of a doubt. You are worthy of carrying the keris, and we will hear the plans you wished to bring before us."\n\n"Honored Tuan, brothers and sisters of these islands," the griffon began, still breathing harshly from the trial. "For nearly a hundred years now, we have been slaves. Our homelands are cowering under the force of a distant conqueror who bleeds us dry. All of our history, all of our culture, beliefs and all that we are is inconsequential to them. All that matters is what we can produce for them, like slaves."\n\n"And you, a descendant of those very griffonians, would hope to resist them?"\n\n"I know their ways," Semuakawan answered "I studied in Feathisia in my youth, and I earned my honors in their military academy. Not that it makes me any more of a full griffon in their eyes, but it taught me how they fight, and how to destroy them. The Grand Tuan is biding his time, but if it explodes, then once again bloodshed will determine the fate of these islands. The question is who will fight for freedom, and who will cower in fear."\n\nAbout an hour later, the griffon left the temple, having changed clothes. Back in his uniform, Colonel Semuakawan of the Royal Feathisian South Zebridean Army looked to the setting sun. There would be blood soon, but by the Tiger he would not be found wanting." 
 YANintro.4.a:0 "Freedom or Death; Freedom through Blood."

 #Indozeeb.1.t:0 "The Chaos Back Home" #Support Loterijen or the Duke
 #Indozeeb.1.d:0 " " #
 #Indozeeb.1.c:0 "We must support the Duke!"
 #Indozeeb.1.e:0 "Then again... what about Loterijen?"

 
 Indozeeb.2.t:0 "The Zebrides Tremble" #Griffonian Empire is in chaos, what to do?
 Indozeeb.2.d:0 "With the news of the Emperor's death, the Zebridean crisis is escalating swiftly. Between a collapsed Feathisian economy, a dead emperor and political upheaval there is simply no way that the balance carefully struck by Governor-General Loterijen can be maintained in the future. The natives are only becoming more and more unruly, and there's no telling what they might to if they wrest control of the region from the administration. A new balance must be struck if Feathisian authority is to remain intact, whether it is through violence or through diplomacy.\n\nAs the meeting is going ahead, other powers are watching and waiting. The Grand Tuan of the isles, Oran Yamar, has gathered his own congress of native Zebras, Kirin and even the Burungbang, those griffons who have come to embrace the local customs and become not colonialists, but neighbors. The Feathisian dominance over the isles have gone on for long enough, and with all the troubles back in their homeland the colonialists are weak.\n\nPrincess Kudakelasi - the closest thing to a voice for all Kirin on the isles - has maintained that if the Feathisians are given no reason to deploy violence then they will not: for all their hunger their distant Adipati - the one they call "Grand Duke" - will not tolerate unprovoked violence. General Semuakawan - once an auxiliary officer serving under the Feathisians - dismisses these notions and calls them naive. Even his family, the descendants of Feathisian settlers, were branded simple natives not worthy of recognition for having adopted the Zebridean culture. There is only one language they understand, and that is violence.\n\nThe question will be which side seizes the initiative and manages to push to achieve its goals." 
 Indozeeb.2.a:0 "Rise, Zebrides. Rise and claim your freedom!"
 Indozeeb.2.b:0 "Feathisian authority united the isles, and it shall remain in place!"
  
 Indozeeb.3.t:0 "Powers of the Governor"
 Indozeeb.3.d:0 "With all the recent troubles facing Feathisia, the question of the South Zebridean Isles has been left to the side for too long. For decades it has been a profitable colony and a good way to remove overly troublesome politicians. Its current Governor-General, Dirk Loterijen, was "promoted" to the position after his ambitious plans to have Feathisia seize a more central role in the empire clashed with the Grand Duke's longstanding friendship with Emperor.\n\nLoterijen has done a fine job maintaining the integrity of the colony, but things has changed and the already fragile stability in the region has all but collapsed. Loterijen has requested reinforcements and emergency powers to hopefully nip the oncoming crisis in the bud. The matter has been hotly debated in the parliament, with one side saying that if anygriff can make sure that the isles remain such a potent resource for Feathisia, it is him, while others say this would exacerbate the situation and that the Governor should be ordered to negotiate with the locals instead, lest we face a full blown revolution."
 Indozeeb.3.a:0 "Loterijen shall have what he needs to restore order."
 Indozeeb.3.b:0 "We will not risk a bloodbath, order him to negotiate."

 Indozeeb.4.t:0 "The Boiling Point" 
 Indozeeb.4.d:0 ""  #Basically, Loterijen dosen't want to negotiate. BAM! Independence Movements goes jihadist and ready to fight for freedam! At this point only the militarists may win because in this path Loterijen always wins because he has the powers from earlier events to put down rebelliosn without permission from De Vluegels.
 Indozeeb.4.a:0 ""

 Indozeeb.5.t:0 "The Final Showdown"
 Indozeeb.5.d:0 "" #Loterijen fights Semuakawan, semi professional garrison that is small vs. big freedam militas. Make it look like it has many things at stake. If Loterijen fails, he's doomed and the Radical Independence Bois will win. If not, the Indepence movement will properlu be destroyed/
 Indozeeb.5.a:0 "Victory!"

 Indozeeb.6.t:0 "Afterthing's Done"
 Indozeeb.6.d:0 "" #The independence movements been beaten, Loterijen has won. May the capitalism begin. Most of the Zebrides is still in shock after Zebrides brutal crackdown, but there is going to be change in the future.
 Indozeeb.6.a:0 "At last, we have power!"

 Indozeeb.7.t:0 "Emergency Powers Granted"
 Indozeeb.7.d:0 "The Feathisian response had arrived that morning, and Governor-General Loterijen could sigh in relief. De Vleugels was committed to supporting his authority on the islands, and was transferring soldiers and equipment to ensure that the local unrest could be dealt with. \n\nSomewhat more annoying was the letter from the Grand Duke that currently rested on his desk. The Grand Duke had not silently sat this one out, but had instead written to him personally to tell him to "exercise the utmost restraint" and to "maintain not merely order, but as good a relation with the local populace as the situation will allow". "Needless bloodshed will not merely destroy what goodwill still exists among the locals, but disgrace our nation in the eyes of all those who value justice and the rule of law" the letter ended, Loterijen almost able to hear the Grand Duke's severe voice through the letter.\n\nWith the letter read, Loterijen calmly tore it up and tossed it in the waste basket, calling for the maid to empty it. Idly, he wondered if the emperor's death had made Gerlach forget why he banished Loterijen to the far end of the world. Feathisia had one chance to hold onto these isles, and Loterijen was not going to waste that by playing nice." 
 Indozeeb.7.a:0 "The Governor-General will do whatever it takes to maintain order."

 Indozeeb.8.t:0 "Emergency Powers Denied"
 Indozeeb.8.d:0 "Governor-General Dirk Loterijen sat quietly behind his desk, fuming as he read the message once again. It seemed that the Feathisian parliament was insistent on tripping him up, whether he was in De Vleugels or on the other side of the world. Not only had his request for emergency powers been denied, the Grand Duke had taken time out of his day to send him a message to lecture him on how to do his job.\n\nGerlach's message told him that "the current situation is indeed one that will require the utmost effort safely navigate" but stated that "an armed response would only provoke further unrest at a time where this can ill be afforded". As if to rub it in, the Grand Duke finished the message with "we are confident that You, as the representative of Feathisia, have the ability to address this crisis with a resolution that will benefit all involved parties, and will give our full support to whatever peaceful solution is reached."\n\nTearing the letter apart, Loterijen stood up and began to pace around the office. De Vleugels had spoken, and his claws were tied. With a sinking feeling in his gut, he realized what this meant. Feathisia had already lost the isles, they just didn't know it yet. He slowly grimaced before calling for his secretary to write a letter."

 Indozeeb.9.d:0 "The Zebrides were never much more than a geographic term before the islands were united under Feathisian authority. Adding to this the mutual mistrust or sometimes even hostilities between local groups and you have a recipe for wildly diverging levels of development in the region. In one end stands Zava, which was quite developed even before the Feathisians established themselves in the region. In the other end lies islands like Mareida and Zimor, which has seen only very modest development even to this day, and where colonial authority is near nonexistent and tribal such is absolute.\n\nThis disparity has only grown more and more with the industrialization of Feathisia and subsequently the Zebrides, and the issue has gone from noticeable to pressing. If the Zebrides are to prosper then it must use all resources available, yet the cost of developing these nigh untouched isles will be immense."

Economic disruptions makes everyone unhappy, but violence against the strikers will reap only fury. Thankfully, with the Lineages on its side, the government is not helpless. After all, there are many destitute zebras who have been left behind by the economic crisis, and though it will take some effort, these can be shipped in to replace the unruly strikers for the time being. Hired muscle will make sure that these workers are protected, and any violence against them will be loudly denounced through all channels. Our secret police will work to infiltrate the meetings and the rallies, picking out key leaders to "disappear" and make sure that their manifestations descend into chaos. Slowly, they will be brought to the brink of desperation, having to choose between going back to work or take to violence. When the latter happens, they will be crushed by whatever means necessary, but only them. Up until then, the average Zebridean will see the chaotic strikes slowly descend into anarchy and a government who acted only when pushed far enough."

However they came though, they are now, centuries later, part of the very fabric of the islands' society, and no facet of the Kirin more so than the Lineages. These extended weaves of familial bonds, be it by blood, marriage or adoption, are akin to small states within the state, wielding immense influence and wealth both, and none so more than the Sopan, whose matriarch - Lady Kudakelasi - stood as the queen of commerce on the central islands.\n\nIf this hadn't been the case, Governor Loterijen would have stayed as far away from her as possible. He did not enjoy dealing with her for the same reason that he did not enjoy being trapped in quicksand, and yet he was in a position where dealing with her was unavoidable. If he was meant to navigate the situation, he needed allies, and she was his best bet.\n\nThus, he smiled forcedly as she came into his office, accompanied by a gaggle of handmaidens, relatives and even a couple of children. He didn't protest when she kissed his cheeks in greeting as if he was a damned Wingbardian, nor did he have her posse thrown out the door (or maybe even the window) when they half transformed the meeting room into a dining hall, buffet and everything.\n\nHe knew how they operated, and he stiffly accepted the offering of food even as he saw the gleam in Kudakelasi's eyes. She knew he wouldn't be so easy as to be softened up with food and drink. He knew that she knew. She knew that he knew. Thus, as he was forced to raise the cup shoved into his claw in a toast, he braced himself for simultaneously navigate their strange cuisine and the twisty mind of the merchant queen."

But I heard, and you HAVE to tell me if this is true, didn't he use to be so in love with this one duchess? What happened between them?"\n\n"It is..."

Bickering tenants were nothing new after all, and those who refused to pay rent were expelled as was custom. And yet, then his servants had been found beaten bloody in the fields after they went to carry out an expulsion. As if that hadn't been enough, then news had reached him that his warehouses in Plumenbang had been burnt down, wiping out over a year's worth of produce. When he raised the rent for his tenants to attempt to recover his losses they had refused, en masse. Instead, they had marched on his home, kicked down the doors and thrown him out.\n\nThrown him out! He, whose family had owned these lands for centuries, thrown out from his home!

Keplon's downfall will result in more resources for Loterijen.
 Indozeeb.18.d:0 "The campaign against Ceram's landlords has progressed well. In many cases, the trust between the landlords and tenants were all too easy to break. In most cases, dragging the landlords' various shady activities into the light has been enough to make the tenants enraged, and with just some additional prodding, many landlords have found themselves destitute.\n\nStill, the landlords have not been taking this silently, and two particularly notable figures have stepped forth to fight back. First is Lord Martabak, who is not only one of the wealthiest landlords in the region, but also the de facto owner of the city of Plumenbang. His household guard is well equipped and highly motivated, and he has not only managed to carry out any expulsions without issue, but also taken to patrolling the roads and shut down any attempted sabotages or bandit activity in the region.\n\nHe is joined by Lord Kepleon, who has maintained his grip on his properties as well through his charitable work and custom of taking in expelled tenants from other lords. After a generation of work, he has sold himself as a wise and chariable grandfather to most of the tenants.\n\nThey are each forming a strong link in the chain keeping most of the landlords from being brought to their knees. The question is which one of them we should focus our efforts on subverting. While Lord Martabak possesses immense wealth due to his influence in Plumenbang, Lord Kepleon's lands are highly wealthy, and are an equally tempting target." 
 Indozeeb.18.a:0 "Lord Martabak's pride will be his downfall."
 Indozeeb.18.b:0 "Let's rip down Lord Kepleon's facade."

 Indozeeb.181.t:0 "The Standoff"
 Indozeeb.181.d:0 "Our efforts to bait Lord Martabak has snowballed into a crisis. Our smear campaigns were meant to undermine faith in the lord and turn his tenants against him. When the situation escaleted and his guards attacked the tenants we could have interevened, protecting our citizens from them. Yet, even as tensions arose, Martabak's response was simply to double his guard force and arm them to the teeth, impose curfews and block the roads. His lands are now, in effect, under martial law. It should be an open and shut case, as his actions constitute armed rebellion, but he is dug in, and his guard is well paid and armed.\n\nWhen a truck convoy from Plumenbang was seized by the militias, local law enforcement responded swifly, only to end up clashing with the militias in an all out battle. Everything is spiralling rapidly out of control: unless we intervene directly we may have a large scale uprising on our claws. The Plumenbang garrison is placed on high alert and forces are being shipped in from Beakavia. Tensions are already rising, and the best thing we can do is stop the islands from exploding.\n\nYet, a proposal has been made to attempt to defuse the situation. Martabak knows he can't win a full on war, and he is unlikely to challenge us in the future, so maybe we should stand down, settle for order restored and a propaganda victory. We would have to drop our claims to his lands, and the resources spent would be lost, but at the same time it would calm tensions in the regions."

Overall, when you pick at the edges of his facade, it starts unravelling quickly, and we've begun broadcasting these facts across his lands.\n\nSadly, he result has been mixed. While tensions have escalated in the region, many of the tenants are still clinging to their master, and the unrest has escalated to outright riots in some areas. Yet, there are as many pro-Kepleon riots, and his position might be less stable, but it is not unsteady yet. Lord Kepleon himself has made a great show of what a victim he is, holding religious ceremonies, doubling down on his charity and blaming us for everything bad that happens in his lands.\n\nIt seems that more drastic measures will be needed to deal with the situation, but the question is if that will play into Kepleon's hooves and paint him as a tragic victim. This would enrage a lot of creatures on the islands. Then again, the alternative is to back down. We could just Lord Kepleon to some land reforms in order to save mutual face. "

Whether through blackmail and smear campaigns, economic warfare or simply the threat of violence, the landlords have been cowed. While several of them remain, none of them have kept their old status. They are now subject to Beakavian law, and their land can be sold and bought as anywhere else. Most landlords have simply chosen to sell their property, with many leaving the islands, and their lands are now on the market, while the few that remain know well that Beakavia is the law, not them.

As with everything on these islands, though, we are left with a dilemma. On one claw, these issues need to be addressed and they need to be addressed decisively. We have enough information to attempt a series of targeted strikes that would have the potential to nip most threats in the bud. On the other, this would be a bloody and very controversial course of action, and there is a risk that we only cause further tensions. A more measured approach could be to undermine the individuals who currently pose the greatest threat, and arrest those who already have taken to violence.

He just really didn't like the obvious answer.\n\nThe Kebangkitan - the Zebridean nationalist movement - had three facets, and only one of them would be amenable to his overtures as it stood. The old believers, especially the Thunder Tiger cultists, had been relentlessly opposed to Feathisian overlordship since day one, and there was no reason to imagine that creatures who ritually scarred themselves were going to be open to discussion. He could manage the cultists though, it was the festering disease at the very heart of the Royal Feathisian South Zebrides Army that was the biggest issue. He guessed that was when happened when you armed locals to aid you; they would want to turn the weapons against you in the end. That group was a prime source of violence, and dismissing them wouldn't solve anything. That only left the local elites that had been empowered due to their cooperation with Feathisian authorities... and that meant that he needed Kudakelasi.\n\nThere was a price to professionalism, and personal dislikes had to be left at the door in order to achieve the results needed. That was why he had ended up here, after all, he didn't believe in personal friendships within politics and had said as much.

Volkssraad wants it on the Western Islands (A), Independence wants it on the eastern island (B), and populace wants more on the central islands (C).

 Indozeeb.71.d:0 "The blow came out of nowhere, too fast to be stopped, and Loterijen recoiled as his monocle was knocked off his face and was sent dangling.\n\n"And what exactly do you think you are doing, you idiot bird?!" Kudakelasi snarled, eyes suddenly wreathed in fire as she pushed him back into his seat, raising the thing she had hit him with. As it turned out, it was her slipper, and she slapped him with it again and again. "Idiot, fool, arrogant griffonian meddler!" She snarled at him.\n\n"I will have you cast out head first, you crazed hag!" Loterijen exclaimed, fending off her blows as he tried to reach for the emergency button under his desk. \n\n"Oh you will cast me out, will you?!" Kudakelasi snapped as she slapped his claw just as he was reaching for the button, forcing him to pull it back. "You will do nothing like that, and you know it!" She brandished the slipper in his face, still enraged to the point where the nirik state seemed only inches away, "Do you want to kill your Adipati with shame?! Even after he told you to negotiate, this is what you do!? Do you have any idea how disappointed he is with you right now?"\n\n"You..." Loterijen stared at her, "You contacted the Grand Duke?"\n\n"Oh yes I did, and we had a nice long talk about you." Kudakelasi informed him, "And dear Gerlach had very interesting things to say about you. Well guess what, the only place Semuakawan or Oran Yamar will send you is the bottom of the ocean, and I am the only reason you are still balancing that gaunt skull of yours on your neck!" Another slap followed and Kudakelasi stood up, still fixing him with her glare even as the flames died around her eyes. "I am the only reason you are still alive, so pack in your ingratitude and start working with me, or do you want to see if you can disgrace yourself into an early grave?" She started donning the slipper again, though when Loterijen began to move again she stopped, giving him a glare and half pulling off the slipper once more. "And not one more word out of you," she growled at him before slowly donning the slipper again, adjusting her crown, turning around and walking out of the office, leaving a flabbergasted Loterijen behind."

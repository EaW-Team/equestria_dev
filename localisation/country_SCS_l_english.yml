 SCS_the_southern_economy:0 "The Southern Economy"
 SCS_the_southern_economy_desc:0 "The Southern Economy rests on two things--oil and agriculture. The first we have in abundance, and the second is constantly threatened. Living as we do in the deserts and dry plains between Equestria and the Jungle, we must capitalize every advantage."
 SCS_no_regulations:0 "No Regulations, No Limits"
 SCS_no_regulations_desc:0 "The barons built the South, and they promise with unfettered hooves they can complete their work. Give them but a few years at least without restraint or unnecessary regulation, and they will create the Great Society we all long for And the Confederacy will be Rich."
 SCS_sober_middle_ground:0 "The Sober Middle Ground"
 SCS_sober_middle_ground_desc:0 "The extremes of dangerous deregulation and stifling over-regulation must be avoided. We cannot afford at this moment to strangle our nascent industry, but we refuse to crush the poor workers under the weight of the rich. Let us find a middle path."
 SCS_nanny_state:0 "Top-Down Regulation"
 SCS_nanny_state_desc:0 "Efficiency is not worth the cost in lives and quality of life. We can be efficient without being cartoonishly monstrous as the barons want. Let us preserve the rights of the workers and protect our society from these predators."
 SCS_the_agricultural_sector:0 "Physiocracy"
 SCS_the_agricultural_sector_desc:0 "The strength and wealth of nations lies in their agricultural production, or at least that's what our leading intellectuals say. It stands to reason that we should look to improve our farms."
 SCS_support_apple_barons:0 "The Apple Barons"
 SCS_support_apple_barons_desc:0 "The families which dominate the apple trade are some of the most powerful in the south. War and chaos has cut into their profits and their massive plantations require a market the size of Equestria itself to be sustainable. Perhaps subsidies?"
 SCS_support_small_farmers:0 "Pioneer Farming"
 SCS_support_small_farmers_desc:0 "The myth of the pioneer is strong, but the truth is that most family farms are a string of disasters. With education and resources, perhaps we can make these farms successful."
 SCS_massive_farms:0 "Big AgriBusiness"
 SCS_massive_farms_desc:0 "The diversifying Apple Barons need a bit more land, and we could use the extra tax income. Smaller farms and homesteads are practically a step away from failure, and letting the barons gobble up the land helps us all."
 SCS_new_frontier_ranches:0 "Farmer Co-Ops"
 SCS_new_frontier_ranches_desc:0 "Our plan to establish farmer's co-ops is ongoing and potentially successful! Struggling farmers are learning how best to produce good yields from their land, and we all stand to benefit."
 SCS_grow_cash_crops:0 "Cash Crops"
 SCS_grow_cash_crops_desc:0 "Apples are the cash crop of the past. Know what's big? Coffee and tobacco, that's what! Let the dirt farmers feed the proles--we'll be making a killing on cash crops, duty free."
 SCS_land_clearance:0 "Clearing New Land"
 SCS_land_clearance_desc:0 "Now that our farmers have a better idea of how to use the land, its time to prepare more of it for cultivation and expansion. We've offered small but good loans to city ponies looking to farm who will train first, and they need space."
 SCS_apple_barons_political_support:0 "Greased Hooves"
 SCS_apple_barons_political_support_desc:0 "The thankful and obscenely rich gentleponies of the South support their helpful government absolutely, and see Confederacy as their bulwark against all alarums."
 SCS_small_town_values:0 "Small Town Values"
 SCS_small_town_values_desc:0 "The Confederacy isn't just a government, but an idea. Our ponies believe in working together, community, and most importantly in the future that we can build with hard work."

 SCS_restimulated_economy_desc:0 "With the path cleared for the barons--proper citizens all--to get the ball rolling, the south is gonna be rich in no time at all."
 SCS_private_rails:0 "The Barons Shrugged"
 SCS_private_rails_desc:0 "Most of the rail lines in the south used to belong to the crown. With our seccession secured, their ownership is up for grabs. Let them go for sale to the highest bidder!"
 SCS_mixed_economy:0 "Moderate Pragmatism"
 SCS_mixed_economy_desc:0 "What we need now is neither radicalism or gold-lust, but simple pragmatic leadership. By private means and by public means, we must build our infastructure reliably."
 SCS_public_rails:0 "Atlas Broken"
 SCS_public_rails_desc:0 "The royal rail lines have been abandoned, and must be reclaimed for the common ponies that depend on them to maintain their livelihoods! State ownerships keeps them away from the Baron's greed."
 SCS_state_capitalism:0 "A New South"
 SCS_state_capitalism_desc:0 "The Barons have had their years of luxury and unquestioned power. They wanted more unearned and unfought-for riches at our expense, and we refused. The South will rise by our work!"
 SCS_private_arms_companies:0 "Colt .38 Special"
 SCS_private_arms_companies_desc:0 "The Captains of Industry, having secured our infastructure, are looking to invest in the Confederate arms manufacturing. We eagerly await their results."
 SCS_dodge_university:0 "Dodge Junction University"
 SCS_dodge_university_desc:0 "We need our own university, and where better than the city of Dodge Junction? Truth be told, there's been one there for awhile, but its always been badly funded and understaffed. Let's help!"
 SCS_public_funding_guns:0 "Guns of the South"
 SCS_public_funding_guns_desc:0 "The Confederacy needs guns, and lots of them. To arm our troops and our state militias, the central government should empower the states and finance the construction of Confederal and State armories."
 SCS_baron_civvies_1:0 "Company Towns"
 SCS_baron_civvies_1_desc:0 "The miracle of modern industry is surely a sight to behold. Free of the fetters of regulation and from the misguided efforts of Labor, Industry surges forward triumphantly!"
 SCS_baron_mils_1:0 "Pluto's Guns"
 SCS_baron_mils_1_desc:0 "Investment by some of the confederacy's leading ponies in our arms industry has resulted in a surge of productivity, as new guns for our brave troops pour off the lines."
 SCS_baron_civvies_2:0 "Further Investment"
 SCS_baron_civvies_2_desc:0 "While our industry still lags behind the old country, our growth is impressive. Certainly, we are one of the fastest growing pony nations on the continent!"
 SCS_baron_civvies_3:0 "Carneighgie Steel"
 SCS_baron_civvies_3_desc:0 "We've certainly done a lot in this brief time as a new nation. We've built a fine industrial base, increased our gross domestic product, and ensured that the confederacy remains prosperous."
 SCS_state_civvies_1:0 "Century of the Common Pony"
 SCS_state_civvies_1_desc:0 "No longer will the factories of the cities serve only the rich. Safety protocols and regulations ensure that good work environments and employment programs put ponies to work."
 SCS_state_armories_1:0 "In Defense of Freedom"
 SCS_state_armories_1_desc:0 "The new south needs more than just steel and rails. It needs guns and ammunition to secure its border against incursion by those who would take its prosperity."
 SCS_state_civvies_2:0 "Building the Future"
 SCS_state_civvies_2_desc:0 "Step by step, we are building a new future for us all to enjoy. Employment programs have probed massively successful and already migrants from the troubled north have joined us as fellow workers."
 SCS_state_armories_2:0 "The Armories of Liberty"
 SCS_state_armories_2_desc:0 "We do not wish for war, but who does? And yet it always comes knocking. But when it comes for us, we will be ready."
 SCS_balanced_development_plan:0 "Clear-Headed Planning"
 SCS_balanced_development_plan_desc:0 "With justice, with peace, with prosperity, and with pragmatic discretion, we will sail a middle course between the radical policies and the reactionary ones."
 SCS_harmonious_economy:0 "To Benefit All"
 SCS_harmonious_economy_desc:0 "The economy should serve the needs of ponies, and not ponies the needs of the economy. Our markets and systems were created to provide for our needs and desires, not to enslave us. We've set it all aright."
 SCS_hoofington_university:0 "Hoof City University"
 SCS_hoofington_university_desc:0 "Hoof City is a big town, and the perfect addition to really get its prestige up would be a university. There's really no downside!"
 SCS_the_oil_industry:0 "Pumped a Lot of 'pane in Junction"
 SCS_the_oil_industry_desc:0 "Oil will be the lifeblood of the southern economy. Most of it is controlled by a scant few hooves, the now rich oil barons who got there early and squatted until they were kings."
 SCS_support_oil_barons:0 "Support the Barons"
 SCS_support_oil_barons_desc:0 "The Oil Barons had the foresight to see how valuable black gold was going to be for a new century. They were right to lay their claim fast and early, and we could learn from that."
 SCS_national_oil_company:0 "Break Up the Racket"
 SCS_national_oil_company_desc:0 "The oil barons are somewhere between cartoon villains and mobsters. With little or no work, they've acquired mountains of bits. They have enough--that oil is too important to be hoarded."
 SCS_desert_reserves:0 "Desert Reserves"
 SCS_desert_reserves_desc:0 "Out there in the desert, there's still thousands upon thousands of barrels of crude just waiting to be claimed. All that's needed is the time and effort of freeing it!"
 SCS_drill_south_croissant:0 "Drill South Trotsas"
 SCS_drill_south_croissant_desc:0 "If we want our oil drilling to be truly profitable, it'll have to expand. We know just the place..."
 SCS_branch_out_into_rubber:0 "Branching Out Into Rubber"
 SCS_branch_out_into_rubber_desc:0 "We haven't given up on oil, but diversifying isn't a bad idea. Rubber ain't as good as oil, sure, but its still in high demand, and not many have been willing to capitalize on it."
 SCS_drill_north_croissant:0 "Drill North Trotsas"
 SCS_drill_north_croissant_desc:0 "Drilling in the South Trotsas has gone swell, but it could be better. Our geologists say that there's reserves north of our fields which would be ripe for the picking."
 SCS_chromium_industry:0 "There's Chromium In Those Hills!"
 SCS_chromium_industry_desc:0 "Chromium is a newcomer on the stage, as far as precious metals go, but it does fetch a few pretty pennies. We'll see if we can't get a bit of it on the market for ourselves."
 SCS_southern_wind:0 "Southern Wind, Blow Along"
 SCS_southern_wind_desc:0 "The Confederacy was never guarenteed to survive it's first year, but it has--it has survived because of our hard work, our devotion to the cause, and to good old Southern Pride."
 SCS_naval_air:0 "Air and Sea"
 SCS_naval_air_desc:0 "We've relied on the royal navy and airforce since the earliest days of colonization, but now we've been left to our own devices with an unguarded coast and an empty sky."

 SCS_expeditionary_navy:0 "Fleet-In-Being"
 SCS_expeditionary_navy_desc:0 "The Confederate navy will be a force of capital ships and larger vessels, built for long range operations and power projection away from our own shores. We will strike wherever we need to!"
 SCS_naval_doctrines:0 "Refining Our Naval Doctrines"
 SCS_naval_doctrines_desc:0 "While starting with royal designs and doctrines was a good beginning, we now need to further refine our approach. No longer can we rely on the past as our guide."
 SCS_expand_rosemarein:0 "Expand the Rosemarein"
 SCS_expand_rosemarein_desc:0 "In order to build a navy worthy of the states, we must first expand our production capability. Already we are expanding the shipyards of the south."
 SCS_marines_bonus:0 "Confederate Marines"
 SCS_marines_bonus_desc:0 "While amphibious assaults are a bit beyond us at the moment, establishing a marine corps might not be such a bad idea! If nothing else, fast and sturdy light infantry is already our modus operandi and has been since the militia."
 SCS_subs_cruisers_cost_discount:0 "Subs and Cruisers"
 SCS_subs_cruisers_cost_discount_desc:0 "Submarines to disrupt landings and enemy supply and cruisers to provide a wall of protection around our own ports and shoreline, that is what we need. Our new production techniques should make both easier to produce."
 SCS_air_start:0 "Up the Airforce!"
 SCS_air_start_desc:0 "While we do have our share of pegasi, war in the air has changed significantly. Planes of various types are a neccessity for the firepower required of a modern air corps."
 SCS_heavy_planes:0 "Flying Fortresses"
 SCS_heavy_planes_desc:0 "Never get stuck picking the enemy apart on a small scale when you can deprive him of supplies all over. The senate has pushed our nascent airforce in the direction of strategic and tactical bombing, focusing on long distances over flashy flying."
 SCS_light_planes:0 "Harriers of the Sky"
 SCS_light_planes_desc:0 "The south hasn't had knights of any sort in a century or three, but that hasn't stopped the romanticism from carrying over. Tales like Ivanhorse have inspired generations of wouldbe southern cavaliers, and they are eager to take to the skies."
 SCS_air_doctrine_bonus:0 "Tuning Our Air Doctrines"
 SCS_air_doctrine_bonus_desc:0 "Just as had to tune our ground and naval doctrines, so to must our approach to war in the air be perfected. This is all new to us, and there is so little margin for error when you're in a flying machine far above the ground ready to explode."
 SCS_radar_bonus:0 "Scanning the Skies"
 SCS_radar_bonus_desc:0 "There were some that doubted RADAR was anything more than a pipedream, but the Confederate joint chiefs have put their faith behind it. RADAR is the way of the future, and we'll need to capitalize on its potential quickly."
 SCS_bigger_airfields:0 "Expanding Airfields"
 SCS_bigger_airfields_desc:0 "As our airforce grows, overcrowding has become an issue. The generals have already assigned battalions to the project of widening the runways and adding dozens of new ones, and already we are erecting new hangars to store all of these aircraft."
 SCS_plane_production_cost_bonus:0 "Planes, Planes, and Plane-mobiles"
 SCS_plane_production_cost_bonus_desc:0 "Some said it was impossible, but we've proven them wrong. The grand air force of the Confederacy stands ready to defend our blessed land's skies and to send packing any invasion of our airspace at a moment's notice."
 SCS_golden_circle_idea:0 "The Golden Horsehoe Idea"
 SCS_golden_circle_idea_desc:0 "Stagnation is death. If the South is to remain strong, it paradoxically must be more than just the South. Some speak of making a golden horseshoe, expanding the meaning of 'south' to include colonies in the savage lands of Zebrica."
 SCS_mobile_doctrine:0 "Old Rebel Yell"
 SCS_mobile_doctrine_desc:0 "We're not ones for sitting around and waiting to get shot at! Southern Ponies stay on the move and take the fight to the foe!"
 SCS_mass_doctrine:0 "Rely On Numbers"
 SCS_mass_doctrine_desc:0 "Our militia ponies have always relied on strength of numbers to ensure success against monsters, buffalo, or anything else they might face. Why change that now?"
 SCS_guns_bonus:0 "Invest in Gun Tech"
 SCS_guns_bonus_desc:0 "Our old weapons are fine tools, but even the best tools become outdated. We need better rifles, but we also need artillery and machine guns for the wars of modernity. An investment today is victory tomorrow."
 SCS_tanks_light_or_heavy:0 "Confederate Armor"
 SCS_tanks_light_or_heavy_desc:0 "Some of our old militia captains were a bit hesitant about this tank business, but we've won them over. Armor is the way of the future, and any infantry force without it is toast. We need some of our own!"
 SCS_motorised_bonus:0 "Truckin' Along"
 SCS_motorised_bonus_desc:0 "Now, if there's one thing a southern soldier is excited about, its a nice new truck. Trucks are the range pony of modern warfare--they're reliable, fast, and carry a lot. Give us a few thousand of these and nothing will be out of our reach."
 SCS_fieldmarshal_advisor_stuart_recon_bonus:0 "General Stewed Apple"
 SCS_fieldmarshal_advisor_stuart_recon_bonus_desc:0 "Success in battle often comes down to who knows what. All the guns in the world won't win the day if they're not pointed the right way."
 SCS_skilled_scouts:0 "Confederate Scouts"
 SCS_skilled_scouts_desc:0 "We may have started as more rabble than army, but we're not fools. Before you can fight effectively, you need to know the lay of the land. Who better as scouts than frontier ponies?"
 SCS_breakthrough_bonus:0 "...To the Other Side"
 SCS_breakthrough_bonus_desc:0 "We have the charge down, but minimizing casualties and maximizing the effectiveness of our assaults is key to getting the most out of our brave boys. Better tactics means a safer Confederacy."
 SCS_eyes_and_ears_decryption:0 "Know Your Enemy"
 SCS_eyes_and_ears_decryption_desc:0 "Frontier ponies resourcefulness sometiems expresses itself in odd ways. We take inspiration from the courteseans and night doves of old who spied for the cause."
 SCS_armor_specialisation:0 "Heay Metal Thunder"
 SCS_armor_specialisation_desc:0 "Nothing gets a country colt grinning like the sound of heavy machinery! Tanks that can punch through the enemy's line or hold onto valuable real estate will be what wins wars."
 SCS_fieldmarshal_advisor_lee:0 "Field Marshal Neigh"
 SCS_fieldmarshal_advisor_lee_desc:0 "No matter how well equipped or well trained, an army without good leadership is hopeless. Luckily for us, we have a strategic mastermind ready to take the reins of the Confederate army."
 SCS_take_the_initiative:0 "Shoot First, No Questions"
 SCS_take_the_initiative_desc:0 "When a ranger and a bandit face off, it doesn't matter whose heart is braver or who has more strength. What matters most is speed-if you don't draw first, they will. You always shoot first."
 SCS_extra_entrenchment:0 "Batten Down the Hatches"
 SCS_extra_entrenchment_desc:0 "They can't shoot what they can't see. We'll turn the wilderness into a fortress-maze of barbed wire and concrete, one that armies break upon. Our engineers will get to work right away."
 SCS_get_more_recruits:0 "Drum Up Some Fresh Blood"
 SCS_get_more_recruits_desc:0 "The frontier isn't exactly densely populated, so manpower will always be an issue. But we can smooth that problem out in the short run with the help of some vigorous recruitment drives and signing bonuses."
 SCS_marse_robert_morale:0 "Marse's Morale Program"
 SCS_marse_robert_morale_desc:0 "A happy, confident soldier or citizen is a productive and useful one. This is a dangerous time, and we need everypony on deck if the States are to survive. Motivation and vigilance will keep our armies tough and our factories running."
 SCS_fieldmarshal_advisor_stonewall:0 "Field Marshal Stone Wall"
 SCS_fieldmarshal_advisor_stonewall_desc:0 "While Neigh is the strategic thinker, no pony alive has ever bested Stone Wall in the tactical game. His forces move thrice as fast and hit thrice as hard as they should--he is a ghost out of the jungle."
 SCS_anti_tank_anti_air:0 "Crack Those Tanks!"
 SCS_anti_tank_anti_air_desc:0 "Our infantry will struggle with tanks, but our air support might have better luck. We'll invest in research and development on close air support to give us the edge against armor."
 SCS_fire_discipline_soft_attack_bonus:0 "Trigger Discipline"
 SCS_fire_discipline_soft_attack_bonus_desc:0 "Our boys are brave, but sometimes a little rowdy. That's a good problem to have! We'll get them to wait till they see the whites of their eyes, and then we'll give 'em Tartarus."
 SCS_standing_like_a_stone_wall:0 "Standing Like a Stone Wall"
 SCS_standing_like_a_stone_wall_desc:0 "The general who said it of Stone Wall may have said it in exasperation, but now we say it with reverance. Stone Wall's trained his forces in defense and it will take an act of Celestia to move them."
 SCS_preserve_soldiers:0 "Every Life is Precious"
 SCS_preserve_soldiers_desc:0 "We may have left Equestria behind, but we kept some of their values. Harmony's concern for the value of pony life isn't just moralism--for us, it is practical. We can't afford to lose too many with our demographics."
 SCS_bigguns_doctrine:0 "Gunsmoke"
 SCS_bigguns_doctrine_desc:0 "A rifle is mighty fine, but a howitzer? Now there's what I'm talkin' 'bout! Get some of those bad boys a-firin', and ain't nopony gonna shrug it off."
 SCS_dugout_doctrine:0 "Southern Redoubts"
 SCS_dugout_doctrine_desc:0 "Every inch of our border is zeroed in and mapped out. Our soldiers can dig trenches and fortify literally anything in a matter of hours, turning every town, hill, and glade into a potential bastion."
 SCS_artillery_bonus:0 "Long Tall Sally"
 SCS_artillery_bonus_desc:0 "This here? This beautiful lady was made in Hoof City, and she can make craters the size of houses. The Confederate Army's got hundreds like her, and we're gettin awful good at aimin' them."
 SCS_magical_weapons:0 "Flirtin' With Disaster"
 SCS_magical_weapons_desc:0 "Unicorns aren't quite as common down here as they are in Canterlot, but we have our share. We have some of our mages workin' hard on weaponizing magic for the common pony, and with a bit of funding..."
 SCS_engineers_bonus:0 "Dixie Engineering Program"
 SCS_engineers_bonus_desc:0 "As we pour more money into education and training, a nice byproduct is that our once ragtag forces now have access to actual, genuine engineers in abundance for the first time. We're putting them to work all over."
 SCS_evolved_tactics:0 "Beatin' The Odds"
 SCS_evolved_tactics_desc:0 "Warfare ain't about being the bravest, the strongest, or the fastest--its about all of those things, sure, but the most important thing underneath it all? Beating the odds. Manipulating the whole world until everything comes up aces."
 SCS_stabilise_southeast:0 "Stabilise The South-East"
 SCS_stabilise_southeast_desc:0 "Soon after the outbreak of civil war in Equestria, the neighbouring south-eastern peninsula erupted into chaos and conflict. Now an unfavourable government has beaten its opponents and risen to power there. We must intervene and ensure peace and order in the south-east!"

 SCS_will_attract_investment:0 "§YWill attract increased investment from Equestrian expats.§!"

 braeburn_desc:0 "A member of the ancient Apple family, Braeburn was just a humble farmer before Equestria's descent into chaos. When the South declared independence, he rose to prominence as one of the most vocal opponents of the Neighvis government. Though he felt a fierce desire to simply march over the border and join the Equestrian army, his family persuaded him that his place was here, in Appleloosa. Instead, he joined the Equestrian Sun Party and quickly rose through its ranks through charisma and sheer force of conviction.\n\nNow the leader of a nation he wishes didn't exist, Braeburn is sure to align the South back toward Equestria. Whether that means requesting re-annexation or just fighting alongside the Princess remains to be seen."
 neighvis_desc:0 "Born to one of the oldest monied dynasties in the South, Neighvis was practically destined for a life of comfort - that was, until his family fell on hard times following a series of poor business decisions. A young Neighvis was forced to watch as the home of his birth was sold to Northern up-and-coming businessponies, and that grudge has been nursed over the course of fifty-odd years of life.\n\nNeighvis built his name gradually, bit by bit, through constant application to the art of letters, writing on a wide variety of topics until he eventually became a popular author. In his twenties he founded the Coltlumbia Party, a fringe group advocating for Southron independence. He is best known for his political essays about the uniqueness and importance of Southern culture as opposed to Northerner culture, which would sometimes rise to the point of screaming Jeremiads against Canterlot. Now that the Southrons are finally a free and independent people, Neighvis will go to any length to ensure that they remain that way."
 silverstar_desc:0 "Silverstar, Sherriff of Appleloosa, wouldn't have been anypony's first choice for the leader of a political party. However, looks can be very deceiving. However, when the Harmony-Unity Party was founded, he was elected as chairpony specifically *because* he hadn't stepped up for the job, and was therefore considered more trustworthy than the career politicians who most felt were only in it for themselves.\n\nStubborn, honest, and uncompromising, Silverstar is hesistant about change in general. While he wasn't thrilled by the decision to break away from Equestria, now that the ponies have chosen it he will defend it with uncompromising grit and gumption."
 rockfeller_desc:0 "Rockfeller's life has been one of catastrophic ups and downs. Born to a poor shoesmithing family, he fell into such destitution in his youth that he wandered into the desert to die. However, fate smiled on him as he uncovered an oil well, leading to the foundation of the Rockfeller business empire. His General Petroleum Company is practically the only oil business in southern Equus, and through years of graft and bribery he has amassed a powerful network of clients and patrons that runs through all of Southron society.\n\nNow that that fool Neighvis is out of the way, Rockfeller is free to pursue his dream, of a South as rich and free as he himself.

With situation stabilized somewhat, the Chairman agreed to hold elections for the highest state position, himself running as a candidate. However, while for some his victory may seem certain, radical Confederate Defence League has been consolidating its support base, while the moderate Friendship-Union Party and its prodigy candidate Braeburn have ran a campaign promising a truly democratic state for all species. With the election day drawing near, emotions are running high, and the winner is uncertain."

However, President Silverstar is an avid fan of the apple-cross banner and, despite its associations, considers it a key part of Southron identity, thus meaning that there is no reason to replace it as the national flag. While this isn't really a critical issue, it would probably be best to get this out of the way now, rather than later."

It seems that independence only served to allow the rich and powerful to trample on the rights of the little pony, rights that we had strenuously protected.

 scs.15.t:0 "Amendment 1: On The Status Of Sympathisers With Foreign Sovereigns"
 scs.15.d:0 ""That the advocation of any mode of government incompatible with liberty or democracy, or of the proposal that the Southern States should not be an independent nation, but instead be subject to a foreign ruler, be made a capital crime, punishable by the full force of law." \n\n The above amendement has appeared before the Convention, championed by the radical Republican factions. However, the Royalists and moderate Republicans warn that somewhere between a fifth and a third of our population believe in the Equestrian monarchy, and that this amendement would effectively criminalise their points of view, which would certainly cause immense strife within our fledgling nation. What shall we make of this amendment?"
 scs.15.a:0 "The Amendment is added to the Constitution - Royalists have no place here."
 scs.15.b:0 "We cannot oppress our own people so. Let them be Royalists if they wish."
 
 scs.16.t:0 "Amendment 2: On The Right To Private Ownership Of Firearms"
 scs.16.d:0 ""As the maintenance of a well-regulated Militia is essential to the security of a free State, the right of the ponies to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." \n\n The above amendment has been presented to the Convention, and enjoys widespread support from the commonfolk, many of whom rely heavily on firearms for the earning of their livelihoods and for ensuring the safety and stability of their communities, especially in lightly-populated frontier regions where police presence doesn't easily reach.\n\n However, one section of the Convention has raised doubts: they point out that the Republic is in an unstable state and faces an uncertain future, and claim that allowing the enemies of the Republic the right to arm themselves is folly. \n\nThey argue that the Amendment should be changed to ensure that the right to bear Arms exists only for those who are trustworthy and known to be loyal to the Republic. How shall we proceed?"
 scs.16.a:0 "The Second Amendment is added to the Constitution."
 scs.16.b:0 "The dissidents have a point - amend the Amendment."
 
 scs.17.t:0 "Amendment 3: On The Continuity Of Prior State Laws In The New Republic"
 scs.17.d:0 ""Any laws promulgated in the several States of the Republic by that power which previously occupied its territory, shall be considered null and void in their entirety."\n\n The above amendment has been presented to the Convetion, but unlike the previous amendments, it is surrounded by an extremely large controversy. This amendment has been heavily supported by wealthy businessponies, including Rockfeller's General Petroleum and agri-barons like Grandapple Farms.\n\n The Amendment's opponents claim that it is clearly designed to abolish the Equestrian regulatory laws, which laid heavy burdens on business owners to ensure that their workers enjoyed a good quality of life.\n\n The Amendment's supporters claim that maintaining the laws of a country we have seceded from is absurd, and that in any case those laws severely hampered the growth of Southern businesses. They also claim that in the old system, Equestrian subsidies had to be provided to ensure that businesses weren't put out of pocket by these laws, something which our fledgling Republic can hardly afford."
 scs.17.a:0 "The Amendment passes without alteration."
 scs.17.b:0 "Alter the Amendment to allow at least the most sustainable regulations to be kept."
 scs.17.c:0 "Scrap the Amendment - bring back all of the regulations."

 scs.18.t:0 "A Matter of Capital Importance"
 scs.18.d:0 "Now that the election has finally been concluded, a new matter has come to our attention: namely, where to locate our capital. This is by no means a small question, for being located at the hub of governmental power can do wonders for a city's prosperity, and every major city in the Republic has made their case to us. \n\n The most obvious choice is to keep the capital in Appleloosa. Though in recent decades it has lost its title of largest city in the South to others, it is still the oldest major pony settlement in the region, and is regarded as the most properly-Southern city in the world. \n\nHoof City bases their claim on the reasonable grounds that they are the largest city in the Republic, and possess the greatest wealth and industrial base. However, Hoof City is a relatively new city, and is dominated by northern expats. Most Southerners don't consider it "truly" Southern, instead thinking of it as a "Northern Colony" of sorts. \n\n Thirdly, there's good 'ol Dodge City. Their major claim lies on their possession of the South's only university, and choosing to locate our capital here would cause an influx of wealth in the region, which would increase the number of highly-skilled workers available to us. \n\n Finally, a rather radical proposal has come in from a senator from the sparsely-populated middle states. They feel that the Republic's population is too concentrated on the coasts, and that the concerns of the brave ponies of the midlands are being ignored. Thus, they suggest that we construct a brand new city in the centre of the Republic to stimulate the regional economy, encourage migration away from the coasts, and to create a stronger feeling of unity among the states."
 scs.18.a:0 "Appleloosa is the Queen of the South, and long may she reign."
 scs.18.b:0 "Hoof City is the heart of industry!"
 scs.18.c:0 "Dodge City will put us ahead of the pack"
 scs.18.e:0 "Build a new capital - redistribute power from the coasts!"
 
 scs.19.t:0 "The Convention Closes"
 scs.19.d:0 "At long last, the Confederate Constitutional Convention has concluded, and the new Constitution has been ratified by all the states of the Republic. Elections have been scheduled for a moon's time, and each party hurriedly enters the campaign trail, hoping to capture the hearts and minds of the ponies of the South."
 scs.19.a:0 "May the best pony win."
 
 scs.20.t:0 "Election Day"
 scs.20.d:0 "At last, the results of the first election of the [Root.GetName] have been held. Ponies lined up from dawn til dark to ensure they had a say in the formation of the first government. For many of them, democracy was an exciting experiment, a dream finally realised. When all the votes were counted and checked, the victor was..."
 scs.20.a:0 "The Equestrian Sun Party, servants of the Princess."
 scs.20.b:0 "The Coltlumbia Party, fathers of independence."
 scs.20.c:0 "Harmony-Unity, stern believers in both Harmony and democracy."
 
 scs.21.t:0 "The Southponies Offer Us A Deal"
 scs.21.d:0 "After much internal debate and some impassioned words, a delegation from the Confederacy approaches the Buffalo. The differences between the Buffalo and the Southern ponies have proven intractable and unending, and while Celestia was in charge they were also managed. But things cannot continue. We need that land. The Buffalo can surrender it and we will give them some reservations to live on."
 scs.21.a:0 "Finally, an answer."
 
 scs.22.t:0 "With Generosity and Charity"
 scs.22.d:0 "A delegation arrives from the Confederacy with a startling offer. Southern ponies and Buffalo have had their differences, but now we must unite against the growing chaos on the continent. They can join the Confederacy as a full state.\n\nBut there is trouble. Not all Buffalo find this to be a good deal at all. Why should they give up an ounce of autonomy to work alongside ponies who already don't respect them? The Confederates cannot abide an enclave, and the Buffalo are keen to keep their freedom. Acceptance would change the status quo in ways unknown, but refusal here could lead to war."
 scs.22.a:0 "United at last?"
 scs.22.b:0 "Our last chance for peace..."
 
 scs.23.t:0 "Our Approach To The Radicals"
 scs.23.d:0 "The Republic currently faces threat from two different poisons - on one side, we have the Royalists, traitors who would undermine our independence and send us right back under the hooves of Celestia.\n\n On the other (and what is more serious, within the bosom of our very own party), lies Rockfeller's faction, a cancerous growth that we have yet been unable to excise. His faction lobbies constantly in the interests of big business and of jingoism, arguing that the South needs to spread her liberties around Equus, by force if necessary. \n\n Both of these are offensive to the Coltlumbia Party and to the South, but it is not in our nature or our custom to censure opponents merely for disagreeing with us. We could move against them, but it would be costly, both in material terms and moral terms. In these troubled times, our energies may be better spent defending ourselves from foreign threats than cleansing minor wounds at home."
 scs.23.a:0 "Censor the Royalists, and find a way to sideline Rockfeller."
 scs.23.b:0 "Live and let live."
 
 scs.24.t:0 "The Power of Money"
 scs.24.d:0 "It isn't unusual for Senators to represent the interests of particular groups, and though somewhat frowned on it also isn't uncommon for those groups to be special interest groups rather than their constituents. This arrangement is generally tolerated and it usually works passably well, but recently a scandal of sorts has broken out. A local newspaper in Rosemarein claims to have obtained records showing that six different Senators in the last moon alone received donations from different foundations, which, upon investigation, each turned out to be owned by the Rockfeller Foundation. \n\nIt seems as if Rockfeller is once again attempting to influence the politics of the South. We don't particularly like him, but it isn't clear that what he's done is illegal, exactly, and his extensive team of lawyers fights every case tooth and nail.\n\nMany within our party would like to further investigate these donations, but that would probably prove difficult, and on top of that, many of the foundations in question genuinely do good work to improve the economy in impoverished areas. What should we do?"
 scs.24.a:0 "A crackdown would be more trouble than it's worth."

 scs.25.d:0 "In the last few weeks, a curious phenomenon has been noted. While the prospect of war is something that the Republic has always been prepared for, they have never desired it. However, in recent days, many of the country's premier newspapers have begun to advocate not only that the South should defend herself, but that we have a positive mission to go to war to spread our liberties to the rest of the benighted world.\n\nScarcely a single paper has publically disagreed with this rhetoric, and one by one they have begun to trot out articles advocating either war or tolerance towards the attitude of those who promote war. Such a startling series of events can surely only be the result of a coordinated effort to influence our nation's politics. Some advocate for this to be investigated, arguing that it presents a clear threat to our democracy and neutrality, but others argue that the newspapers have a right to print what they want, and that infringing on the rights of individuals is contrary to the Southern spirit."

If anyone knows the allure of money, its him--and his words have reached more and more ponies. Some are swayed by his charismatic confidence, and others by his success… and others by his deep pockets.\n\nWorking diligently alongside dozens of pages and a few independent investigators, the leadership of the Coltlumbia Party has not only secured hard evidence of Rockfeller's many crimes--bribery, extortion, fraud--but also has spread it like wildfire. Neighvis confronts Rockfeller and his supporters in front of the entire Senate, laying out a list of crimes that stretches across the republic. The list of bribed senators is unbearably long, and in a panic one and then another breaks down and confesses. General chaos reigns, but none of it helps Rockfeller. His credibility with any but the most perversely cynical is shot."

Today a delegation from [From.GetNameDef] arrived at the capital and is offering an escape from both into a system of mutual cooperation. At least, that's the party line, whoever is in charge these days. The reality is that the confederates are pragmatic enough to realize that eventually their little party is going to have to find allies to be viable. Don't mind the name, they say with charm and a lovely, sugared drawl. The confederacy ain't just about being a southern pony, after all!\n\nTheir resources are valuable, and their money is good.

Merchants no longer have the singular monolithic presence of royal law to keep the rules of the market clear, and now even within Confederate borders there are discrepancies in law and custom that drive businessponies mad.\n\nWhile the southern half of the continent can make do without a common currency, it cannot do without some degree of standardization across the region.

We trade oil for rubber. Rubber means tires, and tires means newfangled automobiles and swifter transportation and communication.

The south's a rough, interesting place these days, and they want a pact of mutual protection. Ain't exactly likely that they're going to war anytime soon, and whatever attacks them is likely coming for us next. Some cooperation would be nice too. However, having to tie ourselves to the slowest, boringest, stodgiest ponies on the continent sounds pretty unappealing, and if they get a little more aggressive they could pull us into wars."

 scs.35.d:0 "Our delegation returned from Las Pegasus with massive hangovers and a truck full of gifts. The city of lights, entertainment, and unrestrained excess has weighed the benefits of our deal and has accepted it. Mutual protection, rationalized free trade, and some technology sharing can only help us both, even if it means reopening the road into Equestria's most tempting, sinful city.\n\nThe old LP is a bit wilder than it used to be, no doubt in response to the stressful world around us, and while it is something of a money sink, the denizens of the desert certainly spend their money freely on anything worth having… like good cider and even better oil."

While they will certainly be buying our whisky, our cider, and our oil to boot, they've no interest in any treaties or arrangements beyond their insistence on free trade. The latent protectionism of the Coltlumbia Party's origins makes them uneasy, it seems.\n\nBeyond being obnoxious and insulting, Las Pegasus' leading families have also left us in something of a bind.

The Confederacy, for better or worse, was always going to have to deal with its Northern neighbors and former comrades at some point. In an attempt to avoid the inevitable conflict and revanchism that comes from bad blood, the Southerners approach the winners of the great schism with an offer of friendship.

The South is seperate from Equestria, and must seek its future as its own nation. That nation would like to be friends, maybe even close allies, but never again will Southerners be a part of Equestria. The name is chosen out of nervousness by its writers, for they know this will not be received gladly even by friendly northerners."

No matter what they might wish were true, they cannot live in the world before the schism. The South left, and only by self-defeating force of arms can they bring it home again. Guaranteeing the rights and freedom of the states, as the Confederates have suggested, will ensure that at least North and South can part as neighbors and comrades. It is the best course of action.\n\nThe treaty's ratification is met with jubilation in the cities of the confederate states, where the growing concern about northern interference in their newfound independence had been festering. There will be peace in all our times!"

The southern ponies may have tamed and gentled the land, but they did it with Canterlot's guidance and blessing, Manehattan's tools, Baltimare's manpower and ships… The point is that there is no ‘North' and ‘South' in the eyes of Canterlot's masters. There are only those who understand reality, and a bunch of dewy-eyed, slackjawed fools who think they can just make a country out of tumbleweeds and spit.\n\nThe Southern delegation is sent packing, and there is civil unrest in Hoof City and appleloosa as citizens panic at the thought of an imminent northern invasion, one that they cannot possibly hope to survive."

The world has changed, and with it changes what is and is not essential. A hundred years ago, the oil in the states wasn't worth that much. Nowadays it is absolutely vital for everything from industry to defense.\n\nThe northern victors need that oil. Everyone does. Why waste valuable resources to obtain it, when the Confederates are willing to offer Favored Nation status and increased trade in oil in return for a little peace? What's the harm? And in return, maybe a few… consumer goods?"

Few can resist the magnet pull of the black gold and however attractive owning it directly might be, not having to spend a red cent on bullets to acquire loads of it at cheap prices is too good a prospect to pass on.\n\nThings may change if Equestria can find new avenues to secure its oil, but its inability to do so (and perhaps even a genuine hope for peace!) is why it signs. The South is pleased, knowing that as Equestrian magnates pull oil out of their ground, truckloads of consumer goods, raw materials, and vital food supplies pour into the Confederacy in return."
 scs.42.a:0 "Black gold!"
 
 scs.43.t:0 "Talks Break Down"
 scs.43.d:0 "The Southern effort to buy peace and better trade terms with its oil break down as tempers flare around the negotiating table in Canterlot. The southerners see this deal, cheaper oil for low tariffs, as perfectly reasonable. The northern ponies see it less as a gentlestallion's deal and more as highway robbery by a pack of cowards and traitors. Why should they bargain for oil that, in their minds, is theirs by right? Who said these upstarts had the right to claim it in the first place?\n\nWhile there's no open talk of war, this chilly reception has certainly dampened many hopes for peaceful co-existence among the confederate populace. Whosoever rules from Canterlot in a very real way dictates the jig the continent dances too, and this particular hoedown may not have room for them."

 scs.44.d:0 "The Confederates have sent a delegation to Canterlot, this time with a surprising proposal. In the past, many southern ponies pointed to the lack of direct royal involvement as one of their grievances against central rule. Now, independant southern ponies arrive suggesting that the Princess at last tour her former domains, this time not as a sovereign but as a visitor.\n\nThey promise luxury, but also a full tour of all the good to be seen. On one hoof, this is a good way to promote peace between two potentially hostile nations. On the other, it's also a good way to show Canterlot that there may be more value in an independant but built-up south than an integrated but empty one."

Fears of imminent revanchist invasion, blockade, or the civil war spilling into their lives evaporate as she descends with a smile. She waves, and they cheer as if they never left the principality.\n\nThe message is clear. The bad blood between crown and confederate may not be totally forgotten, but it is as good as forgiven. They may not be Equestrians, but they are all her little ponies just the same. Her visit is a blessing to all, and she is free in expressing her admiration and pride in their hard work in such a difficult era.\n\nShe does not necessarily approve of everything they've done, however, and does say so when prompted by reporters. But her tone is always conciliatory. She looks forward to the day when strong bonds once again characterize ponies across the continent, from snowy Stalliongrad to the dry hills of Hoof City."

There are flashing cameras everywhere, and the President and a few legislators greet him in a muted but still dignified ceremony.\n\nThere's an odd air over the whole event. To ask with hat in hand for a royal visit of good faith and harmony only to receive a relatively unimportant official is… a bit frustrating. Despite the Confederacy's efforts, Equestria signals brazenly that it will never see its unwanted neighbor as anything other than troublesome foals playing in their annoying sandbox. Adding insult to injury, the dignitary in question is an absolute bore, putting even the most hardened civil servants to sNeighp."

 scs.47.t:0 "A Slap In The Face"
 scs.47.d:0 "The delegation to Canterlot proposing a royal visit as part of the ongoing diplomatic rapport between the Confederacy and Equestria has returned in disgrace. They were, and they do stress this quite literally happened, laughed out of the palace. Canterlot has stated in no uncertain terms that outside of the legitimacy-starved wetdreams of a few southern crackpots, the only reason that a sitting Equestrian monarch would step hoof in their dirty cities was as a conqueror. Or perhaps in charity, when they run their own economy straight into the ground.\n\nThe states have lodged a diplomatic complaint for how their ambassador was treated, but the response from the north has been stony at best. The legitimacy that could have been imbued by such a visit has turned into a bitter embarrassment for the fledgling nation, and not a good sign for its future security with such a neighbor."

But it ain't true that we are cowards, or that we abandoned anypony. Our rights are sacred, but more sacred is our honor. The land that sheltered ponykind, where our ancestors first came together, is under attack from forces dark an' terrible, and we ain't gonna stand for it to fall. The guns of the south are comin', by harmony they are, and if that won't do it we'll show ‘em how you take back a country for good!'\n\nThunderous applause meets this. Even the staunchest and most conservative of Confederates approves--independence is one thing, but ponies have always been slow to abandon each other entirely, after all. Old habits die very hard.

Nothing charges like an angry southerner.\n\nDetermined to tip the northern war in favor of Equestria, Southern volunteers and even a few outfits of regulars pour into the country, crossing the border to link up with beleaguered Equestrian units all across the front. Never again will they let northerners call them cowards. They've got nothing but targets, bullets, and true beating southern hearts! Stand fast, stallions of Apploosa!

While the Changelings are mainly concerned with conquering and controlling the north, their final victory over Equestria and its partisans will only free their forces up to march south.

The rediscovery of an old essay he wrote in favor of batpony liberation helped to bolster the case against him, despite his protests that he merely considered them as being another ethnic group kept down by the Northerners, much like the Southrons.\n\nBefore long, a motion of no confidence was tabled and passed, and Neighvis had no choice but to resign.

To them, the secession was not a grim necessity or a ambiguous opportunity, but a vicious betrayal of all ponykind by a cabal of greedy usurpers.\n\nOur lack of intervention in the war to the north has caused a stir both within and without, as both kinds of loyalists and those sympathetic to them clamor for the south to rise up and contribute to the "defense of ponykind" or whatever it is they're on about.

This Brotherhood aims to break the Confederacy apart and return us all to Canterlot's control one way or another.\n\nWe have a unique opportunity to nip this problem in the bud.

 scs.63.t:0 "Tragedy on the Rails"
 scs.63.d:0 "In the calm of the night, a train rolling along a desolate landscape erupts in flame and death. It careens into the scrublands, but not before closing with a small settlement and devestating its outskirts. All told, there are 39 dead and twice as many injured.\n\nThere are a dozen theories, from a disgruntled rail worker to sheer bad luck. But there is some evidence recently uncovered by our agents that the Equestrian Brotherhood planned this attack, hoping to kill government agents on the train, which they did not. This kind of terrorism is insidious, and if there is any truth to our spy's report, we must act on it immediately."
 scs.63.a:0 "Damn the consequences. Raid every bolthole!"
 scs.63.b:0 "We don't dare risk false accusation."
 scs.63.c:0 "Focus the public on this crime."

 scs.64.t:0 "The Flanchard Manifesto"
 scs.64.d:0 "Named for the mythic hero of Hoof City and largely of the south, Flanchard, this document has circled through the saloons and blackjack tables of a thousand dreary streets. Everypony from the lowliest ranch-hoof to the richest apple baron knows about it and has probably read some of it.\n\nIt is an incendiary document, part bizarrely fervent psuedo-religious document, part plitical agenda, part philosophical dialogue, the manifesto is nevertheless compelling in its assertion that even a free south must owe a duty to the preservation of the Light. In this case, that obviously favors the Royalist cause. The author is unknown, but the publisher is the Brotherhood."
 scs.64.a:0 "Sounds like its time for a ban."
 scs.64.b:0 "It's drivel."

 scs.65.t:0 "Brotherhood Infiltrators"
 scs.65.d:0 "Out of the corner of his eye, the colonel notices a gaggle of junior officers whispering in the mess. They've been more and more reclusive as of late, he notes. Less enthusiastic about their duties. But he hasn't let it get to him until now. Why would he? They keep up a brave face for the troops, after all.\n\nBut now he pauses. A word floats up to him from their hushed conversation. 'Brotherhood' they whisper. His blood runs cold. He rises, thinking to challenge them, to ask questions, but realizes that he is all alone. Who would back him up? The junior officers outnumber him... and, by Harmony, who else have those scoundrels gotten to?"
 scs.65.a:0 "Drive them out!"
 scs.65.b:0 "It's just talk... right?"
 
 scs.66.t:0 "Gunslingers of Flanchard"
 scs.66.d:0 "Desertion plagues the Confederate Army. Soldiers form illegal clubs within the ranks, where Sergeants and Privates are equal. They are the Gunslingers, the knights of a new age, or more accurately, seditious throngs. They do not openly challenge the authority of the senate or of their senior officers, but sometimes notable Gunslingers just walk off base and don't come back. We can't account for more and more supplies, personnel... Our messages take longer and longer to geth through, even just memos across the base might take an hour...\n\n It's almost as if someone is reading them all, copying them down, and making sure they keep tabs on our every move."
 scs.66.a:0 "We have to crush this now, or else."
 scs.65.b:0 "Can we even stop the inevitable?"
 
 scs.67.t:0 "The Southern Crusade"
 scs.67.d:0 "The Royalist endgame is in full swing. Across the states, warbands of gunslinging 'knights' and fast-moving harriers seize villages and trading posts in the name of their Goddesses and of Equestria and Ponykind at large. Confederate soldiers tear off their insignia and turn on their commanding officers, and even some of our civil servants have occupied public buildings and taken prisoner valuable personnel. Our attempts to handle the situation have failed. All that is left is civil war."
 scs.67.a:0 "Rise up, sons of the South!"
 
 scs.68.t:0 "Battles Along the Coast"
 scs.68.d:0 "The rebels race along the coast, raising the banner of the sun in every fishing village and small port. Loyalist confederate troops intercept them, and soon a week-long struggle up and down the coast ensues. Dozens of running battles, small skirmishes between disorganized detachments spill over into settlements.\n\nThis is the first test of the upstart Royalist rebellion, and perhaps the one they have the best chance of winning. In the hinterlands, Royalist sentiments are strong and propelled by the general alienation of homesteaders from their new government."
 scs.68.a:0 "The Government is victorious."
 scs.68.b:0 "Victory for the rebels!"  
 
 scs.69.t:0 "Dodge City-High Noon"
 scs.69.d:0 "In famous Dodge City, a warband of gunslinging rebels face off against a meagre garrison of confederate conscripts. The loyalties of the local lawponies is suspect, and both sides expect the deputies to come into the fight on their side.\n\nJust in case, the rebels have planted sympathetic townsponies all over, waiting for the chance to ambush Confederate fighters. The fighting is vicious, and house to house. In the end, the lawponies of Dodge City are the deciding factor, and they support..."
 scs.69.a:0 "The lawponies side with the Confederates."
 scs.69.b:0 "The lawponies side with the rebels."
 
 scs.70.t:0 "Struggle for the Hoof"
 scs.70.d:0 "In Hoof City, rioting ponies pour into the streets, building barricades across the city's thoroughfares. Soldiers assault them, and the rebels force them back down into the street. The day drags on, and soon some of the less motivated of the rebels begin to fall away. Morale on both sides is low, and now the charges have become bitter, drawn out brawls where ponies with no ammunition or weapons bite and kick in the bloody strets. But at last, the day ends as one side breaks."
 scs.70.a:0 "The rebels hold on."
 scs.70.b:0 "The Confederates break the barricades."
 
 scs.71.t:0 "Battle of Jericho Hill"
 scs.71.d:0 "In the wild west, the war between Royalist rebels and Confederate loyalists is bitter but scattered, chaotic, and atomized. It is less war and more a struggle of heroes against the backdrop of the wild. Warbands claim and counter-claim villages and towns, and the Confederates have the upper hand. At last, the final surviving rebel gunslinger band makes a stand on the lonely Jericho Hill, with free hearts and free foreheads. Their guns are keen and their devotion to the Cause is absolute, but the Confederate army surrounds them and outnumbers them five to one."
 scs.71.a:0 "The rebels beat the odds."
 scs.71.b:0 "Not even gunlinging legends can survive that."

 scs.72.t:0 "Appleloosan Fratricide"
 scs.72.d:0 "In Appleloosa, the fighting is perhaps the cruelest and hardest.\n\nThe fighting here is brother against brother, literally, as the town that the Apples becomes a war zone. The town declared early for the Brotherhood, flying the Solar standard and the banner of Flanchard high on the first day of fighting.\n\nConfederate forces attacked in force, relying on a fifth column of turncoats inside the town to help them breach the palisades and overrun the determined Royalists led by Braeburn himself."
 scs.72.a:0 "Appleloosa burns!"
 scs.72.b:0 "Appleloosa stands." 

 scs.73.t:0 "Rosemarein Strife"
 scs.73.d:0 "A strike by the shipyard workers of Rosemarein before the fighting spills over into a golden opportunity for the hard-pressed rebels. Sowing dissent and promising better working conditions, they gain vital momentum in rushing the adminstrative offices and occupy them.\n\nThe loyalist company sent to dislodge them finds their flanks under constant assault as rebel harriers tossing grenades and spells make any concentrated assault on town hall into a suicidal endeavor. But unbeknowst to the rebels, two more infantry companies are on their way from the outskirts, ready to trap the lightly armed harriers and put the untrained workers and beleagured gunslinger-knights to the torch."
 scs.73.a:0 "A swift and efficient victory."
 scs.73.b:0 "Rosemarein rises up!" 

 scs.74.t:0 "A Brotherhood Broken"
 scs.74.d:0 "It was hard fought, but the rebels have failed to take any government strongholds, and their own have been overrun or torched. Initial gains and enthusiasm for the royalist cause evaporated, and their leaders were either slain or fled.\n\nBraeburn himself, that traitor to the South, is caught and hanged after a sham trial in Appleloosa's ruins. The Royalist cause is lost, though pockets of resistance will live on for years, mourning their lost cause. The rebels are our countrymen again."
 scs.74.a:0 "We are vindicated."

 scs.75.t:0 "The Sun Rises"
 scs.75.d:0 "It was hard fought, but our early setbacks were overcome. The weakness of the corrupt and traitorous confederate regime has been exposed in its swift defeat, and the valor of our arms is clear for all to see. A new transitional government is being put together for the interim, but we are determined that our second chance at loyalty will not be wasted.\n\nThe South shall be a beacon of light and hope against the darkness of betrayal, secession, nightmares, and even Chrsyalis herself."
 scs.75.a:0 "Towards a Greater Dawn!"

 scs.76.t:0 "Taking the Aetherlands"
 scs.76.d:0 "Quietly, around dawn, several companies of our soldiers slipped across the border into the contested Aetherlands. Their task is simple - one cannot fight a war to defend territory that the enemy already controls, and if they are quick they can take the Aetherlands before a defense can be mounted.\n\nOur troops surprised the enemy in his bed, rolling him out and taking him prisoner. They plant the flag in settlements and set up checkpoints on all the roads. By noon the next day, they have complete control over a large part of the Aetherlands."
 scs.76.a:0 "Success!"


 scs.77.t:0 "Aetherlands Disaster"
 scs.77.d:0 "Our attempt at a surprise attack has gone horribly wrong.\n\nOur sneaking soldiers were caught on the roads and scouts were detained. A few small firefights broke out, but in large part [Root.GetAdjective] troops arrived at their targets only to find them held by alert defenders."
 scs.77.a:0 "Who ruined it?"


 scs.78.t:0 "Stepping Back From the Edge"
 scs.78.d:0 "As [From.GetAdjective] troops prepare to seize the Aetherlands, [From.GetAdjective] command pulls them back. The risk of detection is too great, perhaps, or more intel has arrived showing that the Aetherlands putsch will go disastrously.\n\nHigh command never says. They issue the order, and the [From.GetAdjective] troops withdraw. Whatever comes next, it won't be the all or nothing sneak attack that had been planned."
 scs.78.a:0 "Better safe than sorry."

 scs.79.t:0 "Successful Defense"
 scs.79.d:0 "Soldiers crossing our border from [SCS.GetName] recently tried to capture territory from us, but thankfully, our army was able to easily throw them back. The [SCS.GetAdjective] foreign office is staying silent on this matter, but it has been a cause for celebration among our people, especially among the military." 
 scs.79.a:0 "And don't come back!"
 scs.81.t:0 "Abandon Ship"
 scs.81.d:0 "[SCS.GetAdjective] soldiers have been attempting to seize land from us for the last few days, and our troops have been bravely resisting. Despite this, our high command has decided that the land isn't worth the cost in lives and resources, and has withdrawn our forces from the fight." 
 scs.81.a:0 "They can have that worthless trash"
 scs.80.tt:0 "Disaster!" # tt is not a mistake, used to solve loc collision
 scs.80.d:0 "Awful news! The forces of [SCS.GetName] have been able to drive our troops from the contested territory! [SCS.GetAdjective] troops are quelling dissent in the area, and the [SCS.GetAdjective] Diplomatic Office has declared this a merely "temporary occupation" to "defend the lives of the local residents"." 
 scs.80.a:0 "As if anyone would believe such an obvious lie..."

 scs.82.t:0 "Annexation of Rockville"
 scs.82.d:0 "Rockville is a vital hub in the region, and the [Root.GetName] eye it hungrily. Attacking on a wide front might be disastrous, but [Root.GetAdjective] high command has a plan-they will slip in several companies of infantry ponies and take the city by surprise in the night. By daybreak, our flags will fly over Rockville."
 scs.82.a:0 "Rockville or bust!"

 scs.83.t:0 "Rockville Bust"
 scs.83.d:0 "Our infiltrators fail absolutely. Scouts are caught. Guards are on high alert, and the city's mayor is secured. [Root.GetAdjective] forces make a desperate attempt at taking Rockville by force, but as day breaks they have withdrawn from the town's outskirts. Rockville stands free."
 scs.83.a:0 "Damn!"

 scs.84.t:0 "Calling It All Off"
 scs.84.d:0 "Before we can even begin, the first forward scouts blow their cover in a Rockville saloon. Arrested and bound, they spill on the whole operation and high command calls the whole thing off."
 scs.84.a:0 "Unbelievable."

 scs.85.t:0 "The Defense of Rockville"
 scs.85.d:0 "[Root.GetAdjective] forces slip past the border and take out many of the nightguards, but one escapes. The alarm is raised, but the [Root.GetAdjective] forces are already in the streets. Short, furious street battles break out all over. Guards and police fight soldiers, citizens dive for cover.\n\nCan the [Root.GetAdjective]s take Rockville?"
 scs.85.a:0 "Almost there..."

 scs.86.t:0 "The Capitulation of Rockville"
 scs.86.d:0 "The fighting in the streets of Rockville is swift. [Root.GetAdjective] troops capture Rockville's mayor and occupy town hall, the courts, and the armory. The town's leading citizens send a runner to offer their surrender to the victorious [Root.GetAdjective] outriders."
 scs.86.a:0 "Rockville is Ours."

 scs.87.t:0 "Abandoning Rockville"
 scs.87.d:0 "Rockville is a lost cause. The enemy riots in its streets, its defenders are in absolute disarray (those that aren't dead or captured or missing). There's no saving this place, and so it is abandoned."
 scs.87.a:0 "Rockville falls."

 scs.88.t:0 "Southern Oil"
 scs.88.d:0 "When the southern half of Equestria began splintering away, we lost many valuable resources. Chief amongst those was the oil in the central and southwest territories. Today, the ponies of the so-called Confederacy of Southern States have made good on a vague promise of oil, opening their markets to us and even sending a shipment of crude as a gesture of goodwill. Whatever you might think of them, it is appreciated."
 scs.88.a:0 "Finally, good news."

 scs.89.t:0 "Industrialists Flee South"
 scs.89.d:0 "As the war drags on, more and more refugees pour over our borders. Not only do simple citizenry seek safety in the South, but now some wealthy Equestrian industrialists and even engineers are making the journey.\n\nAs Equestria bleeds its best and brightest, we welcome our new additions... and wonder just how long the ancient hegemony will hold together in this state."
 scs.89.a:0 "Mixed news."

 scs.90.t:0 "Industrialists Flee South"
 scs.90.d:0 "News from the wartorn north"
 scs.90.a:0 "Go on."

 scs.91.t:0 "Blame the Mane on Spane!"
 scs.91.d:0 "The CSS Mane, a frigate visiting foreign ports, has exploded! While local authorities are investigating the wreckage and the locals have offered their sympathies. It is an unmitigated disaster.\n\nA disaster that many believe should be avenged. Perhaps this is an inroads into the southern hemisphere for us. While the investigation is still ongoing, many of our citizens and the press are absolutely sure that it was an intentional violent act. Honestly, we are inclined to agree."
 scs.91.a:0 "It's war then."

 scs.92.t:0 "The First Steps"
 scs.92.d:0 "We have pressured Trotico regarding the Mane incident and gotten a nice bit of land with a port as a military base out of the deal. They are, of course, very regretful regarding the shameless destruction of the Mane.\n\nBut are they sorry enough? Some of the furor has died down, but clearer heads begin to wonder about the profit the southern continent might bring us, and of good work that might be done if only there was... better management."
 scs.92.a:0 "It'll do for now."

 scs.93.t:0 "Trotico Invasion"
 scs.93.d:0 "Our rightful vengeance on the villains in Trotico has begun. Of course, our mission is not merely some martial display of vengeance, but really more of a mission of Civilization.\n\nIsn't it a bit of our own fault, letting these ignorant savages have opportunities for mischief? They need a civilizing hand to show them a better way, and this must of course be our burden to bear, as civilized ponies.\n\nTrotico will serve a higher purpose soon."
 scs.93.a:0 "The Pony's Burden"

 scs.94.t:0 "Carrying a Big Stick"
 scs.94.d:0 "Our new policy can be summed up simply as this-to speak softly, but carry a big stick. In peacetime, let us offer goodwill and trade. But to those who rise up against us, or who would work their rapacious harm on our defenseless, ignorant neighbors, we shall be an avenger.\n\nOf course, safeguarding these poor fellows will require us to have some degree of control over their affairs. It's to keep them out of trouble, you see. They're not prepared for the trials of the modern world, and certainly not for one where Changelings and Griffon Empires, and all manner of strange things are amok."
 scs.94.a:0 "When does the soft speaking happen?"

 scs.95.t:0 "The Abyssinian Expedition"
 scs.95.d:0 "Riches! Riches and glory beyond imagination! That is what the poster hanging on the wall of every recruitment center reads. The Confederate Army begins to see itself as a corps of adventurous souls, these days, or so it says. Sign up for a tour of duty defending the South and sheilding the natives of the Golden Horsehoe. Explore new lands and reap the benefits of discovery. Chart a new course!\n\nIt sounds all well and good, and by the numbers it is certainly working. A corps of fresh-faced adventurous sorts is already headed to Abyssinia."
 scs.95.a:0 "Just like in Daring Do!"

 scs.96.t:0 "Fall of Abyssinia"
 scs.96.d:0 "Finding a land mired in decay, decadance, and far too many riches for its own good, the brave Southern lads fought a series of gallant battles against the forces of some local tyrant or other to liberate the good peoples of Abyssinia from their dismal fate of bondage and wretched loneliness, independant as they were.\n\nWe'll of course be reshuffling their government a bit, and cleaning up some of that silly old system. Soon, Abysinnia will be just as exotic and exciting, but far safer and far more lucrative. And orderly, don't forget! It's all in a days work, and just another joy of the Pony's Burden."
 scs.96.a:0 "So it goes."

 FAT_centrism_desc:0 "The right wing of the National Republican Party is an interesting development in the history of the Republic. Once a social-democratic, revoultionary movement, the majority of the Republic's ruling party now supports pragmatic policy, conservative economics, and integration of the Cloudburian natives into the ranks of the NRP. With a defensive-minded foreign policy, an internal policy built on unity and concessions, and an economic policy built on stability and security, the NRP-Right espouses much different principles than the revolutionaries of 978, but surely this is the right path for the Republic."
 FAT_liberalism_desc:0 "The center wing of the National Republican Party, made up mostly of the stalwarts of 978, has kept the principles of Republicanism in their hearts. Revolutionary pan-griffonian idealism, economic social-democracy and welfare programs, along with a militaristic and anti-monarchist view characterize the NRP-Center. Its leadership, made up mostly of generals such as Schabel Sunglider and Walter Emerich, has remained loyal to the Three Principles of Liberty, Demcocracy, and Prosperity - for all griffons!"
 FAT_democratic_socialism_desc:0 "The left wing of the National Republican Party has risen to prominence mostly in the last few years. Made up of young, idealist leaders, the party asserts that the revolutionary principles of 978 must be continued and brought into a new age. The faction claims that instead of social democracy and foreign anti-communism, worker's self management and a Skynavian thaw should be pursued. The party is vehemently against the Old Guard of the Republic, and advocates for the complete and utter dismantlement of the Kemerskai personality cult. A young and radical movement, many have criticized the NRP-Left for its "authoritarianism" and "disdain for liberal groups"."

 FAT_aiding_the_generals_desc:0 "Alexander Kemerskai has done nothing in the last 30 years but sit in his presidential palace and make speeches while his nation collapses around him. The only way to stop Kemerskai and save our dying republic is to support the generals in the North in a military coup against his failure of a government."
 FAT_chaos_in_the_countryside:0 "Support The President-Marshal"
 FAT_chaos_in_the_countryside_desc:0 "Generals run rampant in the countryside, and our own loyal commanders are powerless to stop them. It seems the Republican Dream may soon come to an end if we are not careful in rooting out this cancer from our nation."
 FAT_support_from_the_natives:0 "Support From The Natives"
 FAT_support_from_the_natives_desc:0 "We should seek support from the natives who have suffered the worst under the regime of Kemerskai. Their monarchy was overthrown and their people are given little representation in the Herzlander-dominated government. The generals may also be Herzlanders, but at least we care about the common Cloudburian!"
 FAT_support_from_fascists:0 "Deals With The Fascists"
 FAT_support_from_fascists_desc:0 "The Griffonian National Revolutionary Front was once one of the organizations that allied with our President-Marshal in the battle against monarchism in Griffonia.

 FAT_sway_the_old_guard_desc:0 "The Old Guard is surely fed up with Kemerskai's consistent inability to achieve revolution, so much so that many have fallen into pacifism and conservatism. If we are to challenge the Cloudbury government, we must rally forces skeptical of our incompetent President-Marshal. From conservatism we will breed the ultranationalism of Suntail and the monarchism of Rosewing."
 FAT_bring_in_the_monarchists:0 "Bring In The Monarchist Exiles"
 FAT_bring_in_the_monarchists_desc:0 "There are still griffons who support the Duchy of Cloudbury that formerly ruled over these lands. While most of our supporters disagree with this, we're sure with vague promises of restoring monarchy we can win over many loyalists to House Plumenjar."
 FAT_secure_lostgate:0 "Into Lostgate"

 FAT_secure_windford:0 "Secure Windford"
 FAT_secure_windford_desc:0 "Windford is perhaps our strongest position in the North. However, there are still grifons there that support the rule of the NRP. With a single strike, we can remove these disturbances and overwhelm the local government."

 FAT_the_battle_for_cloudbury_desc:0 "Now that our movement has consolidated the North, it is time to strike at the decadent regime of President-Marshal Kemerskai, and restore order to the Griffonian Republic.

 FAT_solidify_support:0 "Ensuring Popular Legitimacy"

 FAT_presidents_speech_desc:0 "The President-Marshal is an excellent speaker. He will tour our nation to rekindle the Republican Spirit of our people, especially the commoners in the North, who have been swayed by vicious generals who care little for the plight of the people. They must be reminded of the Republican cause!."
 FAT_sack_the_commanders:0 "Remove The Warlords"

 FAT_reform_the_chain_of_command_desc:0 "With new Generals and the same old military bureaucracy and chain of command, we run the risk of turning our new blood into corrupt generals, yet again. This must not be allowed to happen, and a reform is desperately needed."

 FAT_plactate_the_generals:0 "Placate the Generals"
 FAT_plactate_the_generals_desc:0 "Reforming our disloyal military apparatus is of no use. Considering the circumstances, it would be best to bribe and placate our High command, as to ensure their temporary Loyalty. We can deal with their disloyal attitude later, surely."
 FAT_first_general:0 "Placate Suntail" 
 FAT_first_general_desc:0 "General Suntail and his personal band of thieves and bandits have only sprung up due to our firing of him from his post in 1003. If we offer him concessions in exchange for his loyalty, he would surely be a vital ally to the Republic - as he was during the Revolution and the Long March."
 FAT_offer_favors:0 "Some Coins In The Right Places"
 FAT_offer_favors_desc:0 "Suntail always wants to get the most out of a situation, and even though we have the superior military force, he is still asking for concessions. He demands tribute and money from the government in exchange for service in the future and the lives he has lost in the North during his campaign. In the name of peace, unfortunately, we shall have to provide."
 FAT_second_general:0 "Placate Rosewing" 
 FAT_second_general_desc:0 "General Rosewing is a popular General, and unlike Suntail, he has been in the North under orders for a long time.

 FAT_remove_troublesome_soldiers_desc:0 "The worst of Rosewing's soldiers, his monarchist stalwarts loyal only to the failed Plumenjar Dynasty, must be removed to ensure the integrity and loyalty of his troops.

 FAT_concessions_to_nationalist_groups_desc:0 "The Griffonian National Revolutionary Front, banned in 1003 for a terrorist attack on Cloudbury, has allied with reactionary generals and now poses a serious threat to our government.

 FAT_radicalize_the_party:0 "Bolster The Left-NRP"
 FAT_radicalize_the_party_desc:0 "Years ago, before Kemerskai suspended the constitution, the Socialist People's Party fought alongside the Republicans in pursuit of a greater Griffonia. They were right - the only true way to achieve harmony is through a socialist democracy tha gives workers peace, land, and bread."
 FAT_takeadvantageofthechaos:0 "Legacy of the Socialist People's Party"
 FAT_takeadvantageofthechaos_desc:0 "The Socialist People's Party was a party instrumental to the creation of the Republic and its principles, allying with Kemerskai against the monarchists of the South. While some members fled to Skynavia with the party's leader, Asper Sickleclaw, many socialists in the Republic did not leave for Skynavia, and could be swayed to our cause."
 FAT_appeasethenatives:0 "Appease the Natives"
 FAT_appeasethenatives_desc:0 "The natives of Cloudbury have a foreign religion, foreign customs, and foreign ideologies to the Heartlanders who originally launched the revolution. This must not stand - the Cloudburians must be elevated to the same positions as the Heartlanders - at least, we will promise them as such for political support."
 FAT_liberty_or_death_desc:0 "There is no greater serivce to the Republic than fighting in its military to secure the nation against the whims of monarchists! All able-bodied men should fight for liberty, for the only other option is death!"

 FAT_revive_the_nrp_welfare_programs_desc:0 "Kemerskai's welfare programs, although they made great strides during the Revolution of 978, have not been updated and expanded for the modern age.

 FAT_defend_the_nation_desc:0 "Defense is the best form of offense. To safeguard the dream, we must not rush foolhardily into Girffenheim. Rather, we must fortify the border and create international alliances to stand up to the monarchist menace."
 FST_free_the_prisoners:0 "Free the Prisoners"
 FST_free_the_prisoners_desc:0 "Most prisoners of Kemerskai's regime are locked up for petty crimes - such as disobeying orders, banditry, and raiding houses. We should free these prisoners to fight in our army. So what if they engage in morally dubious actions? We need every griffon we can get."

 FST_restoreorder:0 "Order in the Countryside"
 FST_restoreorder_desc:0 "Kemerskai's government allowed bandits and Skynavian-sponsored hooligans to run rampant in the countryside.

We shall show these terrorists no mercy!"
 FST_mass_conscription:0 "Mass Conscription"
 FST_mass_conscription_desc:0 "Every griffon must be willing to fight for their fatherland in the great conflict against the Griffonian Empire. Mandatory conscription will be implemented, so that every griffon will be trained and ready to fight for our survival and our future."

 FST_no_mercy_desc:0 "A bandit life is worth little, and all of our soldiers should know that. Our army has a motto that goes, "Kill them all, and let Boreas sort them out". The bandit threat will be eradicated, and the people of the countryside will know peace."

 FST_sole_legal_party_desc:0 "The Griffonian National Revolutionary Front has little legitimacy in our nation, with many still supporting the parliamentary measures of the NRP and the constitutional monarchy espoused by the late Rosewing.

 FST_revive_the_republican_struggle_desc:0 "After the military junta took power, many in this nation have begun to doubt the Republican ideals, and have begun to support isolationism and regionalism.

Security, Nationalism, and Prosperity shall be our new principles."
 FST_security:0 "The Principle of Security"
 FST_security_desc:0 "Principle I is Security - the belief that every griffon in our great National Republic should be free from threats both foreign and domestic.

 FAT_battleship_focus:0 "Saxhagen-Plumenjar Doctrine"
 FAT_battleship_focus_desc:0 "Otto Saxhagen-Plumenjar is loosely related to the Cloudburian royal family, and is technically the heir to the remnants of the dynasty. Despite his royal blood, Kemerskai kept him and his mother alive, and allowed him to become an admiral as a concession to monarchists. Otto is a strong proponent of naval forces that can squash the enemy through sheer numbers, armour, and calibre."
 FAT_destroyer_focus:0 "Hassentelf Doctrine"
 FAT_destroyer_focus_desc:0 "Hermann Hassentelf is a prominent and loyal Republican admiral, serving in the Revolution of 978 as a naval officer and being promoted to Admiral after the Long March. Due to his lack of access to battleships and carriers as an officer, he has become an expert and a strong supporter of a smaller strike fleet. He argues that battleships and too slow for fast-paced naval combat."
 FAT_submarine_focus:0 "Hit and Run"
 FAT_submarine_focus_desc:0 "Cornelius Helltalon has visited the Changeling Lands more than once, and has become convinced of their Naval Focus on the so called 'Submarine'.

 FAT_navy_investment:0 "Expand Winghagen Ports"
 FAT_navy_investment_desc:0 "The City-port of Winghagen is one of the biggest cities in the Republic, not to mention that its harbours and shipyards are among the biggest in all of northern Griffonia. Nonetheless, there are obvious problems, as most of the equipment used there is obsolete. If we spared some of our funds and nationalised all shipyards there, we could easily make Winghagen into the greatest port of northern Griffonia."
 FAT_navy_doctrine:0 "Perfect Naval Doctrines"
 FAT_navy_doctrine_desc:0 "Our new Admiralty has been lost in arguments for the longest time now, unable to make up their minds on how to proceed in terms of Naval specialisation. It is time we gave them a clear direction on where we are headed with our Naval Doctrine."
 FAT_new_battleships:0 "Research Battleships"
 FAT_new_battleships_desc:0 "Battleships shall be the unquestioned rulers of naval warfare. It is clear to us that they will decide all naval battles, and as such, we should strive towards getting some of our own. A good way to start would be using our new shipyards in Winghaven to construct new battleships. There are talks about two promising projects we could develop there, the Dreadnought-class and the Atreus-class."
 FAT_new_destroyers:0 "Research Destroyers"
 FAT_new_destroyers_desc:0 "Destroyers form the backbone of every naval force in the world, and that won't change anytime soon. There are already many types of them in use, many of which are more technologically advanced then whatever we could hope to create. As such, we should buy a few of them in not-so-great-condition, take them apart, learn everything we can from them, and then use that knowledge to base our own projects on."
 FAT_new_submarines:0 "Experimental Submarine Models"
 FAT_new_submarines_desc:0 ""Submarines" are a relatively new ship prototype that can go under the water and torpedo boats without even being recognized! Our Admirality should inspect foreign models from nations such as Equestria and eventually build some submarines for our own."
 FAT_more_navy_investment:0 "A Second Port On Sky Bay"
 FAT_more_navy_investment_desc:0 "Our only port on Sky Bay is in the city of Winghaven. However, if Winghaven gets destroyed by an enemy or even by a natural disaster, we would have no naval port to dock our ships. A port on the Feathisian border would work well to intimidate the Griffonian Empire and establish another port more south than Winghaven."

 FAT_perfect_the_saxhagen_plumenjar_doctrine_desc:0 "With new battleship designs researched, our admirality now can perfect Admiral Saxhagen-Plumenjar's doctrine.

 FAT_perfect_the_hassentelf_doctrine_desc:0 "Hermann Hassentelf has perfected his doctrine of destroyers and cruisers.

 FAT_perfect_the_marines_desc:0 "Now that we have superior ships, dockyards, ports, and naval bases, we can now perfect our amphibious assault tactics. The Republican Marine Corps will be formed, and we will truly rule the waves - not Skyfall, the Empire, but the Republic will rule the seas."
 FAT_new_airforce:0 "New Republican Air Forces"
 FAT_new_airforce_desc:0 "Only a few of the most powerful countries on the Griffonian continent have Air Forces, and we should do our best to join them in that. Having an efficient, large Air Force to contest the skies and aid our advance down below would greatly aid our war effort."
 FAT_fighter_focus:0 "Rule the Skies"
 FAT_fighter_focus_desc:0 "The most important part of air warfare is to have control over the skies, and as such, we should focus our efforts on creating planes that would let us do that. Our planes should be relatively small and agile, while remaining a deadly threat."
 FAT_bomber_focus:0 "Death From Above"
 FAT_bomber_focus_desc:0 "The biggest premise of this new air warfare is destroying as much of the enemy industry and infrastructure as we want. We should focus on creating planes that can carry as many bombs as possible, while allowing them to strike deep into enemy territory."
 FAT_air_doctrine:0 "Seek Foreign Expertise"
 FAT_air_doctrine_desc:0 "Seeing as how we lack our own professional pilots, we should focus our attention on establishing contacts with veterans from other nations. If we were to give enough of our funds to such pilots, they probably would be very excited and eager to work with us, and we could make them share their experience about air tactics and strategy."

 FAT_grand_1:0 "The Wisdom of Marshal Rosewing"
 FAT_grand_1_desc:0 "We need to plan every attack, every defence, every retreat, and every advance. We need to change our army into something reminiscent of a clockwork, where every action is well-timed and well-planned."
 FAT_grand_2:0 "Strengthen Engineer Brigades"
 FAT_grand_2_desc:0 "To make sure our units are able to follow our meticulous orders, we need to make sure they will keep their positions. As such, we should focus on adding specialised units whose main task is to fortify areas that our troops are currently occupying."
 FAT_grand_3:0 "Reshuffle Our HQ"
 FAT_grand_3_desc:0 "Our recent changes in our army have, as of now, mostly taken care of our top commanders and our units, but we haven't done anything about most of our HQ, or about less important generals. Today, this will change, as we will make sure every one of them will follow our doctrine of extensive planning."
 FAT_grand_4:0 "Sicameonese Defensive Tactics"
 FAT_grand_4_desc:0 "The Sicameonese army maintained vigiliance against the Griffonian Empire for centuries, guarding itself as a decentralised republic in the face of a looming threat. When Grover I attacked in 773, they united and repelled him. We must learn from history, and adapt these tactics to form a defensive army that will make the lives of any soldiers who dare to invade us a living Tartarus."
 FAT_superior_1:0 "The Wisdom of Marshal Kemerskai"

 FAT_superior_2:0 "Introduce Military Police"
 FAT_superior_2_desc:0 "Our army isn't the most disciplined bunch. This has become increasingly worrying to our commanders, who now run the risk of bombarding our own troopers during artillery barrages, simply because said troopers wanted to gain glory for themselves. We must install a proper sense of order and discipline in these soldiers!"
 FAT_superior_3:0 "Dedicated Artillery Units"

 FAT_superior_4:0 "The Power of Artillery"
 FAT_superior_4_desc:0 "With our amassed guns, we now have the ability to utilise the so-called 'Creeping Barrage' tactic, which we can use to scare enemies out of their hiding places before an advance."
 FAT_mass_1:0 "The Wisdom of Marshal Suntail"
 FAT_mass_1_desc:0 "While producing millions of extra shells or drawing up extensive battleplans sounds good, it is also very time intensive and not worth the effort. Instead, we should attempt to draft every able-bodied griffon, hand him a gun and send him to the front. That way, we will have no shortage of troops, and we will be practically unbeatable."
 FAT_mass_2:0 "Convince Militias To Join"
 FAT_mass_2_desc:0 "There are many more or less loyal local militias roaming our country. If we could get in contact with their leaders, and hopefully offer them amnesty, riches, or just promise to grant them some enemy to shoot at, we might be able to get many of these militias to join our army as the backbone of new units."
 FAT_mass_3:0 "Amnesty For The Warlords"
 FAT_mass_3_desc:0 "Instead of offering amnesty only to leaders and officers, we will offer it to every griffon who has ever fought against us. This will surely help us bolster the ranks. "
 FAT_mass_4:0 "Redemption in Death"

 FAT_marshal_rifle:0 "Retake Control of the Stockpiles"
 FAT_marshal_rifle_desc:0 "If there is ample amount of something in our country, it would be guns. From all the conflicts that took place recently, and also because of the increased militarisation in general, it isn’t even that hard to find places with unguarded stockpiles of them. By regaining control over these vast amounts of stockpiles, we could use the weapons to bolster and arm the ranks of the Army."
 FAT_marshal_rifle_quality:0 "Quality Over Quantity"

 FAT_sup:0 "Reorganise Support Units"

 FAT_magic_equip:0 "Utilize the Crystals"
 FAT_magic_equip_desc:0 "Using magical crystals, we are able to create an entirely new kind of gun, one that isn't using ballistic energy but magic instead.

 FAT_mountain_training:0 "Braving The Cloudbury Mountains"
 FAT_mountain_training_desc:0 "It is time to learn some tactics from the natives and train our troops in the warfare of the Cloudbury mountains and the mountains in Northern Strawberry and Whitetail.

 FAT_motorized_equip_desc:0 "While Trucks are an incredibly valuable and effective vehicle to use for transport of troops and supplies, it is also quite evident that they are vulnerable to any sort of incoming fire.

 FAT_tanks:0 "An Armoured Spearhead"

 kingfeather_desc:0 "If you asked a Republican citizen what Heinrich Kingfeather, arguably the second most powerful griffon in the Republic, has done in the last 4 years, despite his vast agenda, they would be unable to tell you anything.\n\nHeinrich Kingfeather was born in 949 ALB in Greengate, Yale. Trained in law and economics, the young Kingfeather did not seem like a suitable candidate for a revoultionary leader at all, but his progressive legal precedents led him to become one of Republicanism's staunchest defenders. As a lawyer and politician first and revolutionary second, Kingfeather advocated for Republicanism at the international level, attempting numerous deals with both Equestria and the River Coalition - both who largely denied his advances. His legal and political action during Kemerskai's term eased public instability and anger at the Republicans, but it could not save the revoultion militarily.\n\nKingfeather, instead of participating in the Long March, fled to Skyfall and then the newly independent City of Fezera, before finally arriving in the Republic to cheering crowds after its control over Cloudbury was secured. Although his inability to support the Republicans in the Long March was a point of disaproval for many, Kingfeather continued to represent the people of the Republic in their new seat in Cloudbury.\n\nKingfeather's work has largely been behind the scenes since he became Kemerskai's second-in-command in 1003, replacing ambitious militarist Schnabel Sunglider with a focus on largely domestic issues. Faced with an unruly military and banditry in the countryside, Kingfeather began to construct a policy that countered Sunglider's beliefs of violent reaction to dissidence. Kingfeather met with hundreds of native leaders in acts that helped mend the complete chaos in the countryside following Rosewing's initial agitation, acts that led him to become one of the most pro-native leaders on the national level. Pragmatism was Kingfeather's main goal, a goal that became more and more difficult with the polarization of the country between political and ethnic lines.\n\nWill he ever succeed? Or will he die with all the cards in his hands and no bravery to use them, as his opposition claims?"

 griffonRepublic.10.d:0 "Reinhard Suntail, a charismatic and vicious veteran who has been training his forces in the countryside and engaging in banditry, along with Claus Rosewing, one of Kemerskai's major officers in the Revolution who has been keen to usurp power ever since Kemerskai's revolution failed, have begun to plot against our government. It is unknown what their plans are, but government agents think they oppose the reforms of the military and are plotting a coup to prvent any check on their banditry and scandalous military practices. Claus Rosewing has been alleged to be part of the Griffonian National Revolutionary Front, an underground nationalist group that opposes both democracy and monarchy, believing a strong, powerful leader can guide the Republic to glory. But if we want to encourage this behavior, maybe we should do nothing..."
 griffonRepublic.10.a:0 "We cannot harm our own citizens."

Many are drawn in by promises of looting and banditry, and are fed up with the consistent low pay from the chaotic government in Cloudbury. This could easily prove problematic for our government, as if Rosewing and Suntail ever revolt against the government, they will have the power of many once-loyalt roops on their side."
 griffonRepublic.11.a:0 "They're just begging for more pay. Let them rebel all they want."

 griffonRepublic.12.t:0 "The Edge of the Abyss"
 griffonRepublic.12.d:0 "We are on the brink of collapse. The mutiny in the army has spread, and even officials of the government are now starting to rebel and ignore our instructions. Citizens, seeing all of this, are starting to arm themselves, and already there have been clashes between militias and disloyal soldiers in the streets. This is our last chance to break this rebellion apart, or our Nation could very well fall apart."
 griffonRepublic.12.a:0 "Perfect. The coup will commence soon, and we will overthrow this decadent government."

 griffonRepublic.13.d:0 "It's too late. The mutineers, deserters and protesters have gathered under the banner and command of our old guard generals. They demand much, but most importantly hate our regime, Republic and our Leader. Our government only controls the area of Cloudbury and the surrounding urban territory, but we will not falter! We will not lose to the traitors! We will preserve the Republic, or die trying. It shouldn't have come to this... but it's time to fight, once again. Time to fight for our liberty!"
 griffonRepublic.13.a:0 "The madgriffs actually revolted..."
 
 griffonRepublic.18.t:0 "A Meeting With Rosewing"
 griffonRepublic.18.d:0 "General Rosewing is one of the most prominent warlords in the republic. While his troops and mandate are supported by the government itself, he seems to only act more independently of the high command everyday, with his forces even raiding local encampments of troops loyal to us. Today, the Republican army held a meeting with Rosewing, in which he claimed he had nothing to do with the raids, and that his regiments had strict punishments for raiding anyway, so there would be no precedent for raiding in his regime. He blamed the entirety of the problems with the unruly army on Suntail and a few unruly soldiers within his army, saying that he had always been loyal to the republic and he would never do such a thing."
 griffonRepublic.18.a:0 "An interesting conversation."
 
 griffonRepublic.19.t:0 "A Meeting with Suntail"
 griffonRepublic.19.d:0 "General Suntail is an incredibly controversial public figure. At 17, he joined the Republican Army and participated in the revoultion that brought an end to the Griffonian monarchy. As the years have gone on, however, he has become more radical and more disillusioned with the Republican dream. Having a meeting with the most dangerous griffon in Griffonia was no small task, but at the end, Suntail demanded 3 major concessions. His first demand was the legalization of the National Revolutionary Front, an underground ultranationalist organization that was convicted of multiple terrorist attacks in 1003 and subsequently banned. The second demand was the pardoning of all raiders, except the radical ones, which he claimed he would "sort out" on his own. The third demand was millions of idols for his troops to "supply"."
 griffonRepublic.19.a:0 "I don't think we have a choice."
 
 griffonRepublic.199.t:0 "The Generals Submit"
 griffonRepublic.199.d:0 "Rosewing and Suntail have come to the Imperial Capital with their most prominent officers on direct order of President-Marshal Kemerskai. The details of the meeting were completely obscured to the people, but journalists believed it was a discussion to finally end the question of banditry in the countryside. Reporters from the Cloudbury Times claimed they saw "Rosewing and Kemerskai walking out of the Presidential palace, shaking hands and talking vigorously." It appears that Rosewing and Suntail have finally sworn their oaths to the Republic never to undergo banditry again."
 griffonRepublic.199.a:0 "Three cheers for the Republic!"
 
 griffonRepublic.198.t:0 "Successful Apprehension of Rosewing"
 griffonRepublic.198.d:0 "General Rosewing has been arrested, reports that we got from the field are not too clear, but it seems that as soon as our troopers approached his quarters, they were fired on. After a short exchange of fire, that left few of our soldiers wounded and dead, they had managed to storm their defences, and as soon as that has happened, all of Rosewing soldiers, with him included, had mass-capitulated to our forces."
 griffonRepublic.198.a:0  "Let's have a public trial to show what happens to those who defy the Republic."
 
 griffonRepublic.20.t:0 "The Bandit Problem"
 griffonRepublic.20.d:0 "Ever since the establishment of our Republic, bandits, marauders, and other criminals were a true problem for everyone not living in the middle of a big city, many years had passed since, but they had stayed a strong thorn against our government. But that has recently changed, as we now put more of our attention on bringing them down, and we can at least guarantee that major roads and communication paths are safe from them. Yet we cannot stop now, there are still smaller and bigger villages and cities being terrorised by them, and many of smaller roads are still infested with that pest."
 griffonRepublic.20.a:0 "Intensify our efforts, make sure that every road, and every city in the Republic is safe."
 
 griffonRepublic.21.t:0 "Banditry Dealt With"
 griffonRepublic.21.d:0 "Today marks the first day when no city in our Republic, nor a road, is taken over by bandits. Our campaign to eradicate them was hard and bloody, but it has payed off in the end, and most of our citizens can now sleep soundly, as we made sure that remnants of once great gangs, bands, and groups had been driven into hiding. But we cannot make a mistake here, even though they hide in forests, and in less scrupulous parts of our cities, they could still return to their old ways if we won't push them even harder."
 griffonRepublic.21.a:0 "Make sure that army scouts every single Forest or hiding hole in the countryside."
 
 griffonRepublic.22.t:0 "Criminals Purged"
 griffonRepublic.22.d:0 "We just got report in, our armed forces have managed to find and swiftly deliver justice to the last band of 'Priesthood' gang. It's quite an interesting end to our campaign, seeing how 'Priesthood' was the first criminal organisation in the Republic. With their end, an age in the history of our country ends. Where once was lawlessness, now there is order, where once every well meaning griff was afraid to go out at night, now you can meet all kinds of merry griffons celebrating whatever occasion, or just having fun together, where once most of the roads had to be travelled together with armed escort, now you can see lone mothers with children going on about their day, more then sure about their safety."
 griffonRepublic.22.a:0 "This will make the lives of every one of our citizens better."
 
 griffonRepublic.42.t:0 "The State of the Countryside"
 griffonRepublic.42.d:0 "Today some truly terrifying reports have reached Cloudbury. It seems that some of smaller villages, and cities are reporting that they aren't getting enough of food delivered to them. It's nothing that surprising considering that our countryside is in chaos, but if we won't be able to fix that, this could lead to some truly worrying consequences."
 griffonRepublic.42.a:0 "Make sure that reports reaching us are true, and this this isn't some overreaction."
 
 griffonRepublic.43.t:0 "The State of the Countryside"
 griffonRepublic.43.d:0 "The Situation in the countryside is bone-chilling, as it seems that previous reports weren't overblown, and were true. What is worse, at this point most of the farmers and places that produce food either keep it for themselves, or sell it privately at greatly inflated prices. And any transports of food are already at great risk of being raided by greedy bandits, or just by starving and desperate griffons. If we wish not to have a catastrophe in our Republic, we should do something."
 griffonRepublic.43.a:0 "Send armed guards together with transports, inspect every mill and every farm for suspicious surplus of food."
 
 griffonRepublic.44.t:0 "Famine Recovery"
 griffonRepublic.44.d:0 "Since the start of our efforts aimed at stopping, and making the famine less deadly, we have managed to help countless griffons, and to keep many more from dying. While situation isn't perfect now, more and more farms and mills are returning to their usual production quotas. But it will still take time before we can safely let things run on their own, especially since there is still few places where hunger is a very real danger to everyone."
 griffonRepublic.44.a:0 "Focus on making everything returning to work as normal."
 
 griffonRepublic.45.t:0 "Famine is Over"
 griffonRepublic.45.d:0 "Today marks the day when the famine has ended, and our food supply is as good as never before. It wasn't easy, and we sadly have to count death in thousands, but this must serve as a warning to us all, that we shouldn't let ever again for such chaos to run wild among in countryside. And as such, our policies of soldiers escorting supply trains, and that of inspections, are here to stay."
 griffonRepublic.45.a:0 "Some small impositions are a small price for keeping everygriff fed."
 
 griffonRepublic.50.t:0 "Vedina Question"
 griffonRepublic.50.d:0 "Vedina is a monarchy, same sort that we had tried to destroy in the year 978, and yet they are probably the only monarchy on the entire Griffonian continent that cares about every single one of their citizens, and where the king acts as an administrator of the realm, and treats every griff with the same rights, no matter if griff is a nobleman, or a commoner. As such, we have to make a hard decision of our policy towards them. We either let monarchy prosper for now, under a wise and caring king, yet risk yet another tyrant rising in the future. But to make sure that won't happen, we also could invade them, and make sure that monarchy will never be a threat to Vedina people, yet it would be such a shame to fight against such a nice King... "
 griffonRepublic.50.a:0 "Until they are just, they are same as us, even if their leader is named a King."
 griffonRepublic.50.b:0 "It is regrettable, but it must be done."
 
 griffonRepublic.51.t:0 "We have been invited to a faction by [FAT.GetName]"
 griffonRepublic.51.d:0 "Today we had been invited to a common faction by [FAT.GetName], they are a republican break-away state from the Griffonian Empire. And they are one of not many nations around us who really gives a damn about the griffons they rule, even if their management isn't the most efficient one. We should take note however, that they are republican to the very depth of their hearts, and as such, if we would refuse, it could anger them into doing something unwise. Yet, at same time, agreeing to getting a common faction with them, while beneficial to common folk, could drag us into a bloody and long war with some of the monarchies around."
 griffonRepublic.51.a:0 "Even if we will fight a war, it is worthy for the Republic."
 griffonRepublic.51.b:0 "We cannot ally with such fanatics as the Republic."
 
 griffonRepublic.52.t:0 "Vedina Agrees!"
 griffonRepublic.52.d:0 "The wise King of Vedina has agreed to an alliance with us, , citing goodness that we can do for common-folk in both of our countries, and how we are the only nations that care for the well being of our citizens."
 griffonRepublic.52.a:0 "A reasonable, freedom loving King? This calls for celebration."
 
 griffonRepublic.53.t:0 "Vedina Refuses"
 griffonRepublic.53.d:0 "As could have been expected, Vedina has disagreed to join our faction, calling us warmongers, and telling us that we would cause thousands of deaths, just for political gains. As always, these are typical monarchist lies, still, it's a bit disappointing that supposedly such a wise and caring king would not agree to join us. But in the end, all monarchies are the same, and this only further proves it."
 griffonRepublic.53.a:0 "Kings will be kings. We will liberate people of Vedina soon enough."
 
 griffonRepublic.54.t:0 "The Bell Tolls For Us"
 griffonRepublic.54.d:0 "After [FAT.GetName] had defeated the Griffonian Empire, and now they are demanding for every state in Griffonia to join their republic. If we would do that, we would have to say goodbye to any of our independence, but otherwise... we might be risking war with The Republic, and that could be very dangerous, or very bloody."
 griffonRepublic.54.a:0 "We have no choice to agree."
 griffonRepublic.54.b:0 "We won't give our independence away to some silly republican pretenders."
 
 griffonRepublic.55.t:0 "Pretender State Agrees on Integration"
 griffonRepublic.55.d:0 "One of the many pretender-state that was born out of the ineptness of the empire has agreed to join us as a republic member state, we give them right to limited autonomy, and having their own elected leaders, but they are our allies and stand together with us when it comes to: Foreign Policy, Military, Science, and Economy. "
 griffonRepublic.55.a:0 "Very good, one potential tyrannical dictatorship less."
 
 griffonRepublic.56.t:0 "Pretender State Refuses Integration"
 griffonRepublic.56.d:0 "One of the pretender-state that has stood with us refuses to bend their knees to us, if we wish to keep our reputation as a major country, and strong player in region, we shouldn't let that go unpunished. "
 griffonRepublic.56.a:0 "Banish them from our faction, they better be glad, we haven't decided to punish them more."
 griffonRepublic.56.b:0 "We need them, for now, but we shall remember this, but as soon as we don't..."
 
 #FLAVOUR EVENTS
 griffonRepublic.60.t:0 "The Invention of Beaklle"
 griffonRepublic.60.d:0 "From a rundown suburb of our fair capital comes an invention which will change the lives of many. A simple school griffon has come up with a completely new way of writing down griffonian using new methods of printing. The method involves printing repeating patterns of dots onto paper, yet these dots do not use any ink at all. The new printer pushes small bumps into the paper. What use is this? Well, up until now the blind have been unable to read. Yet the inventor, who is blind himself, professes this new technique allows blind griffons to read. The invention has taken the education establishment by storm and two different schools for the blind have just opened in our capital."
 griffonRepublic.60.a:0 "The blind can read. Good for them!"

 griffonRepublic.61.d:0 "Reports have come in of a strange sighting from Lake Fenfir. Apparently a group of local youths were having a party at the edge of the lake when a black figure rose from the depths of the waters. They allege to have been attacked, and while authorities have officially disregarded the incident as just some teenagers experimenting with hallucinogens, sightings of the creature have increased. In fact, it's become a bit of a tourist attraction. Any concrete evidence of the creature's existence however has not been found."

If this wasn't embarrassing enough, the prostitute in question, Cataleene Chickela was reportedly also sleeping with another griffon who just so happens to be a known spy for the Communist Revolution Front! Fears that state secrets may have been revealed to Ms Chickela and then passed on through pillow talk have resulted in calls for the defence secretary to resign, pending further inquiry of ill conduct. Jaxon Perfeatherain denies any claims of ill conduct, but has tendered his resignation to the president. In his leaving speech from the senate, he regretted the loss of confidence in him and spoke of a desire to spend more time with family."

 griffonRepublic.63.d:0 "This week has been marred with controversy as Secretary of Housing Tarold Wingwillian made a spectacular blunder in his address to the senate. Somehow his personal assistant had mistyped his speech and missed two entire zeros on the end of a number. Thus, instead of winning national support for our new housing project to build fifty thousand homes, the government has been belittled and ridiculed for pledging only to build five hundred homes. Worse, the Secretary of Housing did not notice the mistake and was thoroughly quizzed on it by the opposition."

After a full twelve hours of fruitless searching, the destroyer appeared again, gliding out of thick fog. It was first thought the report was a fake as the position of the destroyer was well out of the area that it could have possibly travelled in that time, yet there it was. Even stranger, it was discovered afterwards that the destroyer was completely unmanned on arrival. The entire crew has been reported missing and the ship has been quarantined for further scientific and magical analysis."

The Puritan Liberation Movement, as they style themselves, advocates that modern society is too lax about more adult subjects such as sex and relationships. Specifically, they are very concerned about the effect that profanity and violence could be having on the younger generations and advocate for some government controls and censorship of the media to protect those who are more sensitive. Their claims are being investigated by the media regulators, but intervention by central government is not planned as of yet."

Kemerksai's second principle - Democracy, was replaced with Nationalism, the belief that the revolution must encompass all Griffons, and that the Republic should embody a patriotic, ultranationalist movement. The crowds still cheered for Suntail's reforms, but they were cheering for an amalgamation of the original three principles.

Astler's democratic socialist ideals have quickly gained support as many no longer trust Kemerskai to actually bring Republicanism to the people.\n\nSocialist councillors have begun a plan to rally the people under their banner, and wish for an eventual vote of no confidence against Kemerskai's regime.

Brawls in the streets are common between Sutail's fascists and ultranationalists against Rosewing's natives and monarchists.\n\n Supporters of Rosewing advocate for a monarchy, whether it be constitutional or autocratic. His support mostly comes from natives in the north, and his supporters claim that a monarchy will bring about the stability that the Republic never gave them. In addition, a strong monarchic leader would not be prone to the chaos of the National Republican Party, and would quickly be able to act on poverty and banditry in the North, which would be their main power base.\n\n Suntail is perhaps the more dangerous one. His supporters, originally banned years ago due to a series of anti-government terrorist attacks, known as the National Revolutionary Front, want to establish a Griffonian Republic, take Griffenheim, and destroy the old vestiges of monarchy. But instead of a democratic regime like Kemerskai, they want to establish a true national republic, in which the oligarchy is destroyed and wealth is given to the people, as long as they serve the state and Suntail.\n\n Suntail's ultranationalist, populist, and revanchist ideology may prove a danger to Rosewing's conservatism, and it is beginning to attract the lower classes.

An hour later, popular militas and Suntail's blackshirts marched on the military council, demanding the council surrender complete power to Suntail. The council conceded, and swore Suntail in as President and Supreme Leader of the Griffonian Republic. Suntail's policy is radical and dangerous. He supports a return to the Imperial dialect, and he views the language of the native Griffons and Ponies as barbaric. He supports full total mobilization and a lightning war against the Griffonian Empire, which will leave the nation in ashes. From this, he will begin to implement ultranationalist policies as the new leader of the Empire, and conquer all of Griffonia under the new order.

Rosewing's politics differ from the radical Suntail. He is a more conservative figure, loyal to the monarchies of old, such as the Duchy of Cloudbury, which he believes was and will be a better govrnment then Kemerskai's. Rosewing himself has sympathies toward constitutional monarchy, fighting in the Revolution of 978 and still harboring loyalty toward democracy and liberalism. Rosewing's economic policy? Much of the same of Kemerskai's. Strong, social-democratic development will be kept, and with a strong monarch, countryside raiding and banditry wil be annihilated.

Schnabel Sungider, a political idealist and one of Kemerskai's closest advisors, says that the military should be rebuilt and the rebellious commanders sacked, so that the military will be at the same standard of the Griffonian army.

The celebration was complete with a professional band lended from Skyfall for an obscene price, its members sporting fancier suits than the Duke himself. When he reached the parliamentary building, a 21-gun salute was given by the military of the Duchy of Cloudbury.\n\n However, in the homes of most citizens, the atmosphere was very different. The people of the Republic showed disbelief and skepticism. Years after the revolution had been brought north, and Duke Otto Plumenjar was lynched along with his wife Freja, the monarchy was being restored again. Trumpets blared and griffon soldiers paraded across the streets, but there was only a small amount of applause from the crowd, and even those who applauded cared little for the new monarchy. It would take time for the people to grow accustomed to this new regime, a regime that seemed to defy everything the Republic was built on.\n\nIn a speech to the local populace, Duke Oskar emphasized the need to "bring back the idea of a monarchy into the hearts and minds of these corrupted Griffons", and claimed that "the Republican Revolution was the greatest disaster to ever behold Griffonia, and left this land in complete anarchy. It was no doubt the gravest event in the last century." Republican leader Heinrich Kingfeather, in exile in the Kingdom of Vedina, wrote Oskar a strongly worded letter, telling him to "get his inbred group of goats out of this nation before the people lynch you like they did your bastard father"."

In a radio adress to the people, Kemerskai emphasized that the nation would return to civilian rule after the Imperial threat was contained, but also claimed he would not attack the Empire directly, saying that would be "suicide". Given that Kemerskai's emergency both lasts until the Imperial threat is contained but also given that he does not plan to attack the Imperials directly, it appears that the emergency will be almost indefinite."

Kogchel and Astler also made alliances with Erich Mühschnabel and Cyrusval university, a radical but quite "armchair" group of socialists.

 griffonRepublic.217.d:0 "In a radio adress heard by millions across the nation, President Schnabel Sunglider announced his new plan for the nation - harmony with republican characterists. In his adress, Sunglider viciously mocked the Equestrian monarchy for its autocratic nature, where two ponies ruled over all of Equestria, and were seen as gods. He then compared this to the system of divine right which the Griffonian Empire used to justify its legitimacy. In Sunglider's eyes, these two monarchies were one and the same - they were both despotic empires that used religious undertones to convince the people into supporting them.\n\nSunglider's new plan, harmony with republican characteristics, would solve this by implementing "true democracy". The constitution would guarantee the right to both free national elections and decentralized local elections, in which Griffons would be able to influence local policy. Direct rule from Canterlot, he said, is a foolish system, and true harmony needs a decentralized state tailored to different regions. Policy from Angriver to Skynavia would be much different, and local representatives would have significant sway on the government. This decentralized, democratic harmony will surely form the new basis of Sunglider's presiential platform."

Any griffon should be able to start their own business and achieve their own dream, but in recent years, this has been solely lacking, and poverty has only increased. To rectify this, we must continue welfare programs and tax cuts on former Griffonian peasants, ensuring them a living wage and a life free from the poverty the Imperials imposed on them. To pay for these ambitious new social programs, we will hike taxes on the former nobles of the lands, and conduct land reform and even seizure on underworked lands controlled by Griffonian oligarchs. Only then can we liberate our people, and truly achieve prosperity for all griffons."

Socialists believe that the NRP's principle of prosperity is incompatible with the conservative wing of the party, while the conservatives believe the socialists are undermining the principle of liberty with their anti-free market stance. With harmonists and democrats mostly in the middle, they have tried hard to mend the divide and assure both sides that the values of the Republic are being protected, but to no avail. Sometimes, parliament members even brawled with their fellow partymen due to conflicts in economic stances! With the climate growing more polarized by the day, we risk a splinter wing forming off the NRP, and undermining our legitimacy. Some griffons claim that it is necessary to favor one wing and let the other go to stabilize the party, but others claim it is imperative that the party is unified, whatever the cost may be."

No. He will not stand and watch as dictatorships still rule in Griffonia. Now that he has the resources to attack the monarchies of the land, he will do so, and the brave Republican people will march on in pursuit of the three principles.

Within our nation, socialists strike at our decade-old democracy, disregarding the principle of liberty with their beliefs in broad nationalizations and destruction of our free market, capitalist system. Their policies would no doubt collapse our economy and weaken our democracy, allowing their smily, charismatic leaders to sully our Republic and abolish republican rule under the false pretense of "restoring order".

However, conservative economists in the government of Heinrich Kingfeather predict that our nation will fall into economic collapse with too much welfare spending, and that interest rates on Griffonian currency across the nation will spike! We cannot have this, and must roll back welfare reforms, instead relying on the meritocratic forces on the free market, which would ensure that griffons all had a chance to achieve as much wealth as possible. There will be no more burdensome regulations on the people of the Republic, nor welfare programs that condemn griffons to lives of decadence as they scrounge off government benefits. No!

This faction, after finding themselves independent from the most powerful political party in all of Griffonia, initially splintered into many different warring factions. Eventually, days later, Rikard Astler formed the Socialist Party of Griffonia, uniting syndicalists, democratic socialists, and even disaffected social democrats in a large, big-tent, socialist party. With socialists purged from the party, the NRP has shifted to the right, and it will be much easier for us to pass our capitalist reforms. With a legal opposition, we can also begin further democratization of the Republic. The creation of a socialist opposition will be a stepping stone to the eventual building of a multi-party system."

Before the centralization measures, the parliaments of the Hearlands had striking amounts of power, and were delegated large amounts of autonomy. Parliaments in Angriver, the remnants of war-torn Katerin, and Feathisia, due to the large amount of Republicanism in those areas, were able to influence policy in their provinces, and often overruled federal projects and plans for the area. Our government in Griffenheim had to go through so much bureaucracy of local parliaments that we could not even get a simple public works project through the Feathisian government. Thankfully, Kingfeather has reformed these archaic institutions, and weakened these parliaments so they will no longer be a thorn in the side of the Griffenheim government.

He advocates for major welfare reforms, expansion of cooperatives, and industrial democracy. His life in the Grand Duchy of Feathisia has given him a major devotion to democratic values, and he has disavowed many of his connections with anarchists and revolutionary socialists.\n\nThe second candidate is Genevieve Guildedwing, a Skyfall-based social democrat and populist. Her experiences with the unregulated capitalism of Skyfall's oligarchy will make her a candidate who understands the plight of the common folk. She will no doubt establish progressive taxes and transform the Republic into a welfare state.\n\nThe third candidate is Theodore Verany, a griffon very similar to the President-Marshal. An Aquiliean revolutionary who fought in multiple revolutions against the corrupt Discret dynasty, Verany is dedicated to the principles of republicanism and harmony. Verany is beloved by republicans ascross Griffonia, and he is an effective, unifying, candidate. \n\nThe forth candidate is Gallo Ventriglio, a Wingbardian liberal and capitalist, who is a major proponent of laissez-faire economics and friendship with Equestria. Gallo dislikes socialist and statist economics, and prefers a free market economy. Gallo is a staunch democrat, but he is not necessarily a staunch republican.\n\nThe final candidate, and the most loyal to the beliefs of the NRP, is Kemerskai's own son, Alexander Kemerskai Jr., a staunch Republican. Alexander supports centralizing the Republic, strengthening the positions of the president, and making sure that the government is efficient and populist. Opponents say his government would be dictatorial, though he laughs off those accusations."

However, with this new move, our generals are sure that the Republicans will no longer be a threat to the Duchy of Cloudbury.\n\nGenerals loyal to Kemerskai such as Schnabel Sunglider were offered safe immigration back to Cloudbury, although whether they will continue to serve in the army has not been decided yet. In addition, parliamentarians such as Heinrich Kingfeather and Tobias Sivenhof, conservative and centrist members of the NRP, were also given free immigration back to the Republic, and they will be allowed to participate in upcoming parliamentary elections, which will be held "in the future", according to the Duke.

Claims that Astler was a Skynavian informant were quickly shut down, and the government declared they were still committed to the Republican dream and had no interests in bending to Skynavian policy.\n\nKemerskai himself has commented on the government change from his estate, telling the Cloudbury Courant that it was a "disgusting move that spits in the face of everything our great Republic stands for, even if it is so-called democratic socialism" but that he had "no choice" but to comply and resign. Is this a new dawn for the Republican dream, or the beginning of a Republican nightmare under a socialist government?"

Just a child, not even fifteen years of age, yet standing firmly in his orange imperial robes and with the crown on his head. He was afraid, Kemerskai had seen too much to miss it, but he remained standing in front of the throne meeting his gaze with one packed with so much: fear, anger, pride, determination, defiance. \n\n"Well, revolutionary?" the boy said. "Are you here to see how an emperor dies?" His voice almost broke on the last syllable. Even with his firm last stand, it was a child's voice! \n\n"Eyr's mercy, no," he said, sighing. Instead he walked over to further away, where he chair stood, grabbing it and pulling it up to the throne, sitting down on it and looking up at the boy. Five and ten minutes passed before young Grover slowly sat down himself. "I'm sorry," Kemerskai told the young crown prince, his claws clasped together. "You were four when your father died and your childhood ended, weren't you? Eleven years is a long time to be made into something you're not." \n\n"I know what I am, traitor!" Grover VI spat. "I'm the rightful emperor of Griffonia, and I'll never be anything else!"\n\n"Exactly," Kemerskai agreed sadly, stopping Grover in his tracks. "Grover the Doctor, or Grover the Gardener... Grover the Baker maybe. That never could happen. You never got to choose. Never got to make your own life... you never got to live." Stopping himself, Kemerskai sighed. "Hate me if you must, how can I be anything but an old monster to you, but maybe one day, when you are older, you will understand... or not, and you'll still hate me. But then at least that is a choice you can make." "

However, despite our efforts to reform our new Republic and reverse the failures of 978, there is still one question on every griffon's mind.\n\nThe Child-Emperor.\n\nGrover VI was seized by Republican spies during the assault on Griffenheim to prevent a bloodly lynching along the lines of the regency council's bloody murders in 978, however, since then, he has languished in a prison cell below his former palace. He has been provided with bread, water, and an agreeable room and condition, but still, even he asks what is to become of "the Emperor".\n\nSuch a question has been asked many a time in the Republican Parliament. Schnabel Sunglider, despite his commitment to democratic principles and Republican unity, has demanded we enact justice against the young emperor, for "the unforgivable crimes of his father and the crimes him and his vile regent plotted to commit across all Griffonia." However, Sunglider was soon silenced by Kemerskai himself, who stated that he would spread no children's blood for the purpose of sheer vengeance and carnage. Heinrich Kingfeather, ever the pragmatist, has declared that Grover VI must be liberated as a citizen of the Republic, to show that we are "better than the corrupt and twisted ways of the Imperials". Kingfeather's proposal would see the emperor stripped of his titles so he and his lineage would bear no threat to the Republic, although another option has arisen - Erich Kreiger, a Republican industrialist and conservative, has suggested we simply send Grover VI to Equestria - they would likely not use him as a political asset and teach him in the ways of friendship and harmony.\n\n After a heated debate between proponents of Kreiger's exile plan and proponents of giving the young Grover citizenship, the final verdict was reached..."

Persecute him for the actions of his regent and his father? Such a solution would be as unjust as it would be asbsurd, and ironically it seems that the solution lies within a monarchy, or rather a diarchy.\n\nThe nation of Equestria has come to our aid, offering to shelter the young griffon. They will give him a new home, education and - hopefully - a new purpose in his life. It would be an adequate dumping ground for the prince, and Equestria has - for all its political failings - a reliable enough diplomatic standing that we can most likely trust them to not use him against us.\n\nAs young Grover is escorted down to the docks, where a ship is waiting for him, the old adage that "a compromise leaves everyone equally unhappy" comes to mind. The hardliners sees it as betraying the republican cause, the remaining monarchists sees it as another atrocity. Still, none will be too mad about it, and it will give the republic time to prove itself. Even if Grover returns in twenty or so years, he will return to a changed Griffonia. "

Rikard Astler pranced around the streets, and him and his gang of mindless industrial workers who hadn't even lived through the revolution were becoming a severe threat to the Griffonian Republic. To rectify this, one of our agents went to his home in urban Cloudbury and shot him dead, fortunately escaping without being caught.\n\nA truly tragic suicide.\n\nWith the death of Astler, Kemerskai's control has truly been assured in the Republic.

I lived thirty years of my life as a hero but all will remember me as a tyrant..."\n\nHe struggled to get the words out, gasping with pain and crying in shame.\n\n"All I did... I did for stability, for the Republic, for our future... You have to restore democracy, as I should have done... Do not die a tyrant as I have."

However, using the anthem of the NRP for the national anthem could be viewed as an attack by many small parties that have begun to form in parliament. Even without its political undertones, "The Tricolour" is still a divisive anthem - it's chorus, "Though cowards flinch and traitors sneer, we'll keep the tricolour flying here," has been viewed as offensive and crass. However, it still stands as one of the most popular unofficial anthems and is a staunch Republican tune.\n\nThe next song in consideration is "Risen From Ruins," a tune popularized during the Republican Revolution itself, that speaks of a united, free Griffonia. While "The Tricolour" speaks of Republicanism in general, "Risen From Ruins" speaks of our final goal. "Let us serve your good weal truly, Griffonia, our fatherland."\n\nThe last song for consideration is "Unity and Justice and Freedom", the third stanza of the popular Griffonian song "Das Lied der Griffonien", also called "Song of the Griffons". Our democratic values and our views for a united Griffonia are echoed in every word of this third stanza. In addition, picking a song that has already been popularized among the people of Griffonia may prove a boon to our legitimacy as the rightful successor to the dying Empire.\n\nIn the end however, which song shall be chosen?"

Erion XII suffered the same fate, although by a mob of trade unionists, not at the hands of the National Republicans.\n\nWith most of the Archons dead and the new ones just as bad, Suntail announced a new plan - one that would completely curtail the political power of the Archonate. They would no longer have the ability to influence the public of Griffonia at all, with encyclicals coming upon strict censorship by Suntail's NRIF to make sure it was not peddling inaccurate information. Archons and prelates would not be allowed to hold political office, and many temples not in use would be demolished for recreation or for industrial purposes. \n\nAny Archon subject to treason against the Republic would be tried and replaced with another one, who would hopefully learn not to speak out against the President-Marshal, and the same would go for even the lowliest prelate.\n\nAlthough many have condemned this decree as being tyrannical, the true defenders of the National Republic recognize the necessary measures of control on the traitorous Archonate."

Every prisoner in the Imperial Cells was let out, and the people soon began to march upon the Imperial Palace. Kemerskai and many other imperial officers who had participated in an army-wide mutiny, along with hundreds and hundreds of commoners, stood at the gates of the seat of Imperial power and their government.

The victory was decisive, and Count Jonas's forces were beaten back to the North, where after further confrontation with Republican forces, eventually fled into Bronzehill and left fighting entirely.

Elections were also contested by revolutionary right-wing organizations, such as the National Revolutionary Front, led by the now-dead Peter Alstrenner, which advocated for staunch anti-monarchism, fanatic nationalism and pan-griffonian identity, along with a corporatist economic system.\n\nTo no-one's suprise, Kemerskai won with 77% of the vote, with Sickleclaw and Alstrenner both recieving under 15% of the vote. The NRP's unitary rhetoric, democratic principles, and the fact that the revolution was still ongoing and the people wanted stability, gave them an easy ride to victory. Kemerkai's experience as a war hero made him a very popular candidate, and his cabinet was generally built on compromise between moderate factions. It included army generals, idealists, pragmatists, all united under democratic cause and purpose. At least, in theory.\n\nKemerskai's first 100 days were suprisingly stable, as the Griffonian counter-revolutionaries still were licking their wounds in Bronzehill and Strawberry and did not undergo major attacks against the Republic during that time. To appease the workers, peasants, and other disaffected citizens, Kemerskai immeadiately began to implement large-scale reforms. The first act of his government was to remove any lingering positions of slavery, serfdom, and servitude in the Empire, freeing all who would fall under those positions, even when many of those tactics were not practiced any more by the Empire. Kemerskai improved welfare reforms for common griffons, establishing industrial changes such as minimum wage laws and steep taxation of Griffonian nobles and oligarchs to redistribute wealth to the common griffon. His policies were massively popular, and Kemerskai's approval ratings soared. However, Kemerskai's government did find trouble with inflation, with his economists often focused more on welfare policies than balancing the budget, leading to the printing of massive amounts of idols to satisfy Kemerskai's lofty ambitions\n\nFor now, at least, Griffonia was free."

 griffonRepublic_history.7.d:0 "Unfortunately for the Republic, the Griffonian nobility in exile did not simply let the Republicans take over their nation. The young Grover V, aided by his faithful guardian and religious mentor, Archon Eros VII, launched a counter-revolution. Aided by the Count of Bronzehill, whose subjects were surprisingly loyal to the monarchy, and the Duke of Stawberry, who had married Grover's aunt, the counterrevolutionaries gained a foothold in the North. Coming from Bronzehill and Strawberry, Imperial forces overwhelmed Republican forces in Intterriver, putting an end to the socialist Republicans who had taken root there and restoring the Barony of Vinnin under Kemerskai's brother, August Kemerskai I. Asper Sickleclaw escaped with his life, and continued to support Kemerskai's National Republican Party, although many ultranationalists had abandoned Kemerskai during the collapse of the Republic.\n\nWith Diamond Dogs, Archon Eros VII, and associated Imperial, Feathisian, and Eagleclaw forces marching against the President-Marshal, Alexander Kemerskai ordered a full retreat from Griffenheim, desiring a tactical retreat into the north and eventual takeover of the weak Duchy of Cloudbury, sending letters to all generals in the army. The armies that participated in this Long March included Kemerskai's own army currently in Interriver, the army of Claus Rosewing and Max Whitefeather currently fighting in Katerin and Angriver, and Reinhard Suntail's army also in the North. There were many more units that attempted to participate, but they were rooted out by roving Imperial armies and annihilated. Many Republican armies stayed in Angriver and hid in the great Schiebwald, commencing small raids on associated Angriverian forest towns. Others went to Katerin, including knight brigades that had sided with the Republicans, which produced an odd combination of pious knights and republican revolutionaries."

As a teenager, he began to support Skynavian socialist movements, but he relented after his father got a promotion to a prestigious government position and could not leave with him, not wanting to leave his family alone. He has been known for his more radical ideas, supporting councils of workers and peasants and asking the Republic to fully recognize the government of Skynavia. His proximity to the working class of the Republic and his lack of war fervour and nationalism have allowed him to secure a seat as the Republic's minister of industry."
 FAT_political_2:0 "Erich Kreiger"
 FAT_political_2_desc:0 "Erich Kreiger, born in the Peasant's Republic of Greifenmarschen, was always attracted to republican ideals and rhetoric. He found the peasant's republic, however, severely lacking, as it was a puppet to the monarchists in Griffenheim, and was too weak to get anything substantial done. He joined the Republicans soon after. His experiences in Greifenmarschen have given him skepticism for a decentralized state. Because of this, he joined the right wing of the NRP, believing that a strong government would solve the problems of banditry. Krieger's experience allowed him to become the minister of armaments and war, but he has been criticized by natives for his inability to speak Cloudburian."
 FAT_political_4:0 "Cornelius Vinke"
 FAT_political_4_desc:0 "A prolific Republican author, Vinke was born in Fezera. He became famous for his provocative writings, and was eventually exiled from Skyfall for "disturbing the peace" after a particularly violent Republican rally. He found himself in Feathisia, where he joined the National Republican Army. After the march, he became more and more reclusive, and eventually disappeared from public eye entirely, holing himself up in his house on the Vedinan border. He continues to write, but his style becomes more and more confusing, and his writings more and more cryptic. Some of his newer books have sold exceptionally well, such as one criticizing the monarchy of Equestria called "The Lie of Harmonic Monarchy". However, some of his published works have been downright insane, such as one book where he claimed "In the end, the goats will return, and ally with Maar to end our race.""
 FAT_political_6:0 "Reinhard Suntail"
 FAT_political_6_desc:0 "Described by many as the "second most powerful griffon in the republic", Reinhard Suntail was one of Kemerskai's most trusted generals during the Griffonian Revolution. A brutal man, Suntail's ideology is driven by vengeance and hatred towards the Griffonian Empire and its political system, which he calls "decadent" and "oligrachic". Suntail's relationship with Kemerskai was broken when Kemerksai banned the Griffonian National Revolutionary Front, an organization Suntail was a member of, which advocated for ultranationalism and pan-Griffonian politics. For years, Suntail has led an autonomous army in the countryside, beginning a campaign of banditry against armories, towns, and farms in the region, contributing to the unruly army that threatens the republic. With enough concessions, however, the most dangerous griffon in the Republic could eventually become one of Kemerskai's most trusted associates, willing to die for the Revolution."

Stefano joined the army, but was consistently mocked for his Wingbardian upbringing, and found solace in the Republican, pan-griffonian movement developing in the region. Stefano would eventually participate in the Revolution and the Long March. However, he was unable to speak Cloduburian and only knew a small amount of the Herzlander dialect. While a banking expert from his time in the Wingbardian School of Economics, he has begun to drink and waste himself, fed up with his inability to interact with most of the Republic's people."
 FAT_political_8:0 "Olaf Restjen"
 FAT_political_8_desc:0 "Olaf, a native of Cloudbury and ever the pacifist, joined the Republic during the Long March. He was a prolific artist, and his art often carried pacifist and republican themes. When the NRP took over the Duchy, Olaf Restjen joined them, and became a popular figurehead for the Republic. He founded the Lostgate Academy of Art, and after that, was elevated to the first Senator of Lostgate. After 2 successful terms under the Harmonist wing of the NRP, he distanced himself from factionalism, disliking the current NRP-Harmonist leader, Schnabel Sunglider, who advocated for militant expansionism and armaments manufacturing to strike at the Empire. Olaf resigned from his position as senator and resigned to return to his life of painting. He was given the Medal of Honor from President-Marshal Kemerskai for his work in art, and continued to serve the Republican cause through his work."
 FAT_political_9:0 "Claus Rosewing"
 FAT_political_9_desc:0 "Claus Rosewing was once Kemerskai's most trusted friend in the battle against the Griffonian monarchy. Rosewing was born in 941 in the city of Griffing, Angriver, perhaps the most backward imperial province. From an early age, he witnessed the poverty common in that area of the Empire, and wondered why it occured.\n\n At the age of 24, he joined the Imperial Army, a couple years before Alexander Kemerskai. When Kemerskai joined the army, they developed a fast friendship, and began to discuss Republican and harmonic ideals. Rosewing, ever the pragmatist, disagreed with the regime of Grover V moreso than the concept of monarchy. He believed that in the right situation, a monarchy could possibly be reformed to suit harmonic ideals. They marched together on the Imperial Palace, and when Kemerskai assumed power, he appointed Rosewing as his second-in-command.\n\nRosewing eventually fled north with Kemerskai, and the two suffered many disagreements about Republican rhetoric and ideals, including Rosewing's sympathy for monarchy, leading Rosewing to be cast out as head general in favor of the ambitious Reinhard Suntail, who had ties to outright fascist groups. Rosewing, disilluisoned, took his army brigades and went North.\n\nEventually, Reinhard Suntail joined him, in an alliance of pure chance against the regime of Kemerskai. Rosewing's doubts about the Republican ideal manifested into full hatred, and he eventually abandoned the ideals of harmony altogether, idolizing military dictatorships and bandit states. Rosewing, however, never stooped to the level of Suntail's raiders, and always distributed raided wealth among his troops. He preffered to raid armories, and warned his soldiers against attacking towns, pronouncing the death penalty for any Republican officer who would do such a thing. Rosewing's style of banditry became popular among his soldiers, but whenever he looted the lands he once fought for, he turned sour, and he always thought back to the times he spent with Kemerskai."

He was sheltered by his mother in Griffenheim, and Kemerskai, fearful of losing them, arranged for them to take a boat from a recently-captured Feathisian port up to the peaceful Kingdom of Vedina. When Kemerskai eventually arrived at Cloudbury after his failed revolution, he asked for his son to come with him, and in 981 ALB, they were re-united, Alexander Jr. only 14.\n\nAlexander, like his father, joined the military once he became 18 and served with dignity, rising the ranks to become a general of the Republic, like his father before him."

Trained in law and economics, the young Kingfeather did not seem like a suitable candidate for a revoultionary leader at all, but his progressive legal precedents led him to become one of Republicanism's staunchest defenders. When the Revolution broke out in 978, Kingfeather was originally skeptical, but eventually joined Kemerskai once Griffenheim had been seized and the regency council driven out. As a lawyer and politician first and revolutionary second, Kingfeather advocated for Republicanism at the international level, attempting numerous deals with both Equestria and the River Coalition - both who largely denied his advances. His legal and political action during Kemerskai's term eased public instability and anger at the Republicans, but it could not save the revoultion militarily.\n\nKingfeather, instead of participating in the Long March, fled to Skyfall and then the newly independent City of Fezera, before finally arriving in the Republic to cheering crowds after its control over Cloudbury was secured. Although his inability to support the Republicans in the Long March was a point of disaproval for many, Kingfeather continued to represent the people of the Republic in their new seat in Cloudbury.\n\nKingfeather's work has largely been behind the scenes since he became Kemerskai's second-in-command in 1003, replacing ambitious militarist Schnabel Sunglider with a focus on largely domestic issues. Faced with an unruly military and banditry in the countryside, Kingfeather began to construct a policy that countered Sunglider's beliefs of violent reaction to dissidence. Kingfeather met with hundreds of native leaders in acts that helped mend the complete chaos in the countryside following Rosewing's initial agitation, acts that led him to become one of the most pro-native leaders on the national level. Pragmatism was Kingfeather's main goal, a goal that became more and more difficult with the polarization of the country between political and ethnic lines.\n\nWill he ever succeed? Or will he die with all the cards in his hands and no bravery to use them, as his opposition claims?"

### Leader Descriptions ###

chadskai_desc:0 "Former Artillerieoffizier in the Imperial Army, Marshal Kemerskai was set to have a promising career in the armed forces. But fate had different ideas for Griffonia.\n\nThe tumultuous years that preceded 978 have disillusioned Kemerskai of his loyalty to the Emperor. He could not stand seeing the decadent nobility leech of others' hard work, nor did he approve of the awful conditions the commonfolk were subjected towards. Thus, he began plotting with like-minded officers and made use of the brewing peasants' insurrection. After a particularly crass display of authority abuse from the Regency Council, the people had enough and stormed the Imperial Palace. In the confusion that followed, Kemerskai found his way as the leader of the newly proclaimed Griffonian Republic.\n\nBut this success was not meant to last. Although Kemerskai was popular and commanded respect, he could not control everygriff, and ruling the already weakened country became impossible. It did not take long for a reactionary movement to rise up and banish the republican supporters from the Heartlands. The long march began towards the northern reaches of the fractured Empire, where they have taken control of the region from nobles attempting to start their own independent nation.\n\nMany years have passed since those events, and yet Marshal Kemerskai's devotion to the republican cause has not wavered. Although even now he has to deal with unruly subordinates, he still holds all the cards in his claws. He is also a prolific author, and his many writings inspire republican movements across the entire Griffonia to follow his cause."
suntail_desc:0 "Reinhard Suntail was born in Crona, a province in the heart of the Griffonian Empire. His family was poor, and lived on scraps. Suntail, wanting to escape the dreary farmlands of Crona, joined the Imperial Army at the age of 15, and journeyed to the city of Griffenheim, where he was placed into the brigade of Alexander Kemerskkai, a renowned Artillerieoffizier in the Griffonian Empire and one of Grover's most promising generals.\n\nSuntail joined Kemerskai's plot to overthrow the empire, believing the monarchy of Griffonia was decadent, oligarchic, and drew upon the worst conditions of Griffonkind - greed and lust for power. Suntail participated in the battle for the Imperial Palace, and eventually found his way in command of an entire Republican batallion. With it, he went to his old hometown of Crona and engaged in a brutal looting campaign in an event which would be recalled as "The Rape of Crona" years later.\n\nWhen the revoultionaries began the long march north, Suntail began to doubt the harmonist values that Kemerskai was so dedicated to, and joined a new party - The Griffonian National Revolutionary Front, an ultranationalist organization dedicated to populism, republicanism, and fanatic devotion to the nation state and people. While Kemerskai did not trust Suntail, he was forced to make him the second most powerful griffon in the republic, and he became Kemerskai's top general.\n\nWhen the National Revolutionary Front was banned after a terrorist attack in Cloudbury in 1003, Suntail sent his army North, and began to loot, plunder, and sack both Republican and foreign strongholds for weapons and loot. He became a vicious bandit warlord, known for his sheer brutality against both harmonist and monarchist insitutions."
rosewing_desc:0 "Claus Rosewing, once Kemerskai's most trusted friend in the battle against reaction, was born in 941 in the city of Griffing, Angriver.\n\n At the age of 24, he joined the Imperial Army, and soon became a mentor and comrade to Kemerskai when he joined the army soon after. They both were staunch supporters of Grover IV and his new reforms - but they also believed in radical republicanism and democracy. Rosewing, ever the pragmatist, believed that a regime like Grover IV's would make revolution unncessary - and that the people should only revolt when monarchy becomes oppressive and decadent. When Grover V took power, however, Rosewing became a supporter of revolution, participating in the mutiny of the Imperial Army during the March on the Imperial Palace. Rosewing participated in campaigns in Angriver and Katerin, and was appointed in late 978 as Kemerskai's offical vice president.\n\nRosewing eventually fled north with Kemerskai, but by that point, the two had suffered many disagreements about Republican rhetoric and ideals. In 995, Rosewing was soon removed as Chief of Staff and Vice President - for Vice President, Kemerskai appointed Schnabel Sunglier, a staunch Republican, and for Minister of Defense, Reinhard Suntail, an openly far-right but skilled general.\n\nRosewing was sent North to keep the peace with a sizable force, but instead of keeping the peace, Rosewing began to undermine it. His warlord band soon built connections with native and monarchist groups, and Rosewing engaged in the looting of Republican armies and stockpiles. However, Rosewing was not fully anti-government, and always made sure never to attack towns - any soldier who did so would recieve the death penalty. And there, in the north, Rosewing has stayed, "defending the peace" for 10 years and counting."
oskar_desc:0 "Oskar Plumenjar was never supposed to be duke of Cloudbury. Oskar was born to a commoner, August Plumenjar, in 956 ALB. When Kemerskai's revolution was brought north, and his distant relative, Otto II was executed by Kemerskai, the rest of the legitimate Plumenjar line was taken captive and eventually killed.\n\nWhile this prevented a takeover from monarchist forces, there were still Plumenjars who were alive. In 776 ALB, the infant Erik Plumenjar was betrayed by his great-uncle and regent Frederik, who took the throne for himself and disinherited Erik and any of his future offspring. Erik's line was legitimatized to save the House of Plumenjar, and August begame the leader of the house. August and Oskar, living in the Northern Tribes, a pony community north of Cloudbury, plotted a return to the throne of the Duchy.\n\nWhen August died in 1002 ALB, Oskar became head of the house. He is a quiet, well-mannered griffon, who was until now not interested in pursuing his claim. Oskar preffered to live a peaceful life in the Northern Tribes, developing friendships with the local ponies there and becoming officially bilingual.\n\nJust now, however, Oskar was restored to the throne by warlord Claus Rosewing, who declared him Oskar I of the Duchy of Cloudbury. The line of Plumenjar would continue, and Cloudbury would once again stand under monarchic rule!"
hafslund_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 30th of July, 973 in Bleakspire\n\n§YPolitical Affiliation§!: §RNRP-Left§!\n\nJonas Hafslund was born in the Duchy of Cloudbury in 973 ALB, but when the Republicans moved North to secure the Duchy, his parents turned coat, cheering the Republican army as they marched through the hills of Bleakspire. Hafslund followed suit, and when at the age of 18, he immeadiately enlisted in the Republican army - like many new recruits, he was attracted by the passionate speeches of the President-Marshal but also by new, young radicals such as Rikard Astler. Hafslund found himself supporting socialist ideals, and participated in many social-democratic and democratic socialist organizations while an officer.\n\nIn 998 ALB, at 25, Hafslund was elevated in rank yet again at the request of many councilors who believed him to be loyal to the Republican cause should large-scale disobedience occur. Hafslund, along with the young strategist Otto Gremmersen, became one of the key griffons of the Young Officer's Movement, loyal to social-democratic policy and revolutionary ideas - in sharp contrast to the old guard who had once been entrenched in the Griffonian army.\n\n While Hafslund is still a relatively mediocre general, he has certainly become one of the harbingers of a new movement in the Republic - which has put him at odds with many of his fellow generals..."
emerich_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 21st of January, 952 in Winterbell\n\n§YPolitical Affiliation§!: §MNRP-Democratic§!\n\nWalter Emerich was born to a family of merchants in Winterbell, Strawberry, and was expected to join the family business at the Griffing river. Emerich, however, had different plans for his destiny, and when he turned 16, he bid his parents farewell and took a steamboat down the Griffing to Griffenheim.\n\nCity life, however, was not what Emerich believed it to be - and he soon wished to be back in Strawberry. Disillusioned with the poverty and strife in the capital following the death of the popular Grover IV, Emerich became active in underground republican circles.\n\nWhen revolution broke out in 978, Emerich rejoiced, and participated in the storming of the Imperial palace along with thousands of commoners. Despite not having a shred of military experience, he was appointed as an officer by the President-Marshal for his actions in the storming of the palace, but most historians attest Kemerskai appointed him to ensure support among fanatic republicans - who still viewed him as an opportunist.\n\nEmerich learned quickly from his fellow officers, participating in the First and Second Interriver Campaigns - but was defeated at the Second Battle of Vinnin by Erich Ebonwing.\n\nEmerich would subsequently participate in the Long March and post-revolutionary politics, being appointed provisional senator of Brenna by Kemerskai, a position he holds to this day - although now he stands as a military governor, fanatically loyal to the Marshal who gave him a new life."

schnabel_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 12th of February, 959 in Griffenheim\n\n§YPolitical Affiliation§!: §MNRP-Democratic§!\n\nSchnabel Sunglider did not lose his eye in the service of his glorious Republic so that he could see it fall to limp-wristed conservatives, Skynavian-sympathizing democratic socialists, and vicious warlords. Vice-President of the Republic from 995 to 1003, and Chief of Staff from 1003 onwards, Schanbel Sunglider has been one of the staunchest supporters of the regime of Alexander Kemerskai and the democratic values that were promised by the revolution of 978.\n\nEver the idealist, Sunglider has fought for the rights of the people since he joined the National Republican Party in 975 ALB, becoming an unofficial leader of the party during his teenage years. From there, he rose to power in the revolution of 978 ALB, shaking claws with Marshal Kemerskai and together proclaiming the Griffonian Republic, along with generals Claus Rosewing and Reinhard Suntail. Sunglider fought with Reinhard Suntail in the Crona campaign, but took a bullet to the eye during the fighting. Whisked away by medics, Sunglider miraculously survived, but found Crona in ruins - Reinhard Suntail had sacked the city to the ground in vengeance for Imperial crimes and the percieved death of Sunglider.\n\nAlthough he never fully recovered from the loss of his eye, Sunglider kept fighting, and dissatisfied with Suntail, Sunglider fought with Kemerskai during his campaigns in the North with a fury that two-eyed griffons could barely match. A one-eyed phantom, Sunglider remained a battle-hardened tactician and fearsome general throughout his service in the Republican military.\n\nNow, Sunglider is in a prime position of power, and is ready to protect the Republican dream at any cost."

 FAT_centrism_desc:0 "The right wing of the National Republican Party is an interesting development in the history of the Republic. Once a social-democratic, revolutionary movement, the majority of the Republic's ruling party now supports pragmatic policy, conservative economics, and integration of the Cloudburian natives into the ranks of the NRP. With a defensive-minded foreign policy, an internal policy built on unity and concessions, and an economic policy built on stability and security, the NRP-Right espouses much different principles than the revolutionaries of 978, but surely this is the right path for the Republic."
 FAT_liberalism_desc:0 "The center wing of the National Republican Party, made up mostly of the stalwarts of 978, has kept the principles of Republicanism in their hearts. Revolutionary pan-griffonian idealism, economic social-democracy and welfare programs, along with a militaristic and anti-monarchist view characterize the NRP-Centre. Its leadership, made up mostly of generals such as Schnabel Sunglider and Walter Emerich, has remained loyal to the Three Principles of Liberty, Democracy, and Prosperity - for all griffons!"
 FAT_democratic_socialism_desc:0 "The left wing of the National Republican Party has risen to prominence mostly in the last few years. Made up of young, idealist leaders, the party asserts that the revolutionary principles of 978 must be continued and brought into a new age. The faction claims that instead of social democracy and foreign anti-communism, worker's self management and a Skynavian thaw should be pursued. The party is vehemently against the Old Guard of the Republic, and advocates for the complete and utter dismantlement of the Kemerskai personality cult. A young and radical movement, many have criticized the NRP-Left for its "authoritarianism" and "disdain for liberal groups"."

 FAT_support_from_the_natives_desc:0 "We should seek support from the natives who have suffered the worst under the regime of Kemerskai.

 FAT_support_from_fascists_desc:0 "The Griffonian National Revolutionary Front was once one of the organizations that allied with our President-Marshal in the battle against monarchism in Griffonia.

 FAT_sway_the_old_guard_desc:0 "The Old Guard is surely fed up with Kemerskai's consistent inability to achieve revolution, so much so that many have fallen into pacifism and conservatism. If we are to challenge the Cloudbury government, we must rally forces skeptical of our incompetent President-Marshal. From conservatism we will breed the ultranationalism of Suntail and the monarchism of Rosewing."

 FAT_bring_in_the_monarchists_desc:0 "There are still griffons who support the Duchy of Cloudbury that formerly ruled over these lands. While most of our supporters disagree with this, we're sure with vague promises of restoring monarchy we can win over many loyalists to House Plumenjar."

 FAT_plactate_the_generals_desc:0 "Reforming our disloyal military apparatus is of no use. Considering the circumstances, it would be best to bribe and placate our High command, as to ensure their temporary Loyalty. We can deal with their disloyal attitude later, surely."
 FAT_first_general:0 "Placate Suntail" 
 FAT_first_general_desc:0 "General Suntail and his personal band of thieves and bandits have only sprung up due to our firing of him from his post in 1003.

 FAT_offer_favors:0 "Some Coins In The Right Places"
 FAT_offer_favors_desc:0 "Suntail always wants to get the most out of a situation, and even though we have the superior military force, he is still asking for concessions.

In the name of peace, unfortunately, we shall have to provide."
 FAT_second_general:0 "Placate Rosewing" 
 FAT_second_general_desc:0 "General Rosewing is a popular General, and unlike Suntail, he has been in the North under orders for a long time.

 FAT_remove_troublesome_soldiers_desc:0 "The worst of Rosewing's soldiers, his monarchist stalwarts loyal only to the failed Plumenjar Dynasty, must be removed to ensure the integrity and loyalty of his troops.

 FAT_takeadvantageofthechaos:0 "Legacy of the Socialist People's Party"
 FAT_takeadvantageofthechaos_desc:0 "The Socialist People's Party was a party instrumental to the creation of the Republic and its principles, allying with Kemerskai against the monarchists of the South. While some members fled to Skynavia with the party's leader, Asper Sickleclaw, many socialists in the Republic did not leave for Skynavia, and could be swayed to our cause."

 FAT_appeasethenatives_desc:0 "The natives of Cloudbury have a foreign religion, foreign customs, and foreign ideologies to the Heartlanders who originally launched the revolution.

 FAT_defend_the_nation_desc:0 "Defense is the best form of offense. To safeguard the dream, we must not rush foolhardily into Girffenheim. Rather, we must fortify the border and create international alliances to stand up to the monarchist menace."
 FST_free_the_prisoners:0 "Free the Prisoners"
 FST_free_the_prisoners_desc:0 "Most prisoners of Kemerskai's regime are locked up for petty crimes - such as disobeying orders, banditry, and raiding houses. We should free these prisoners to fight in our army. So what if they engage in morally dubious actions? We need every griffon we can get."

 FST_restoreorder_desc:0 "Kemerskai's government allowed bandits and Skynavian-sponsored hooligans to run rampant in the countryside.

 FST_cult_of_the_two_marshals_desc:0 "Alexander Kemerskai was one of the greatest leaders in the history of Griffonia - before he was cut down by the treasonous forces of Claus Rosewing and his monarchist stalwarts.

 FST_a_false_marshal:0 "Erase Kemerskai's Legacy"
 FST_a_false_marshal_desc:0 "There is no need to rehabilitate the traitor that is Alexander Kemerskai.

 FST_sole_legal_party_desc:0 "The Griffonian National Revolutionary Front has little legitimacy in our nation, with many still supporting the parliamentary measures of the NRP and the constitutional monarchy espoused by the late Rosewing.

 FAT_mass_mobilization:0 "Militarize and Mobilize"
 FAT_mass_mobilization_desc:0 "We need to militarize our nation if we are to defend against the Empire, which will eventually strike North. Forts, military factories, war propaganda - all must be implemented to save our nation from the monarchist threat."

 FAT_new_navy:0 "A Navy To Challenge Rottendedam"
 FAT_new_navy_desc:0 "Since the birth of our Republic, we didn't have even a single vessel under our command. It is time to change this. With the establishment of a proper Navy, we have a great opportunity to rule the seas in northern Griffonia."
 FAT_battleship_focus:0 "Saxhagen-Plumenjar Doctrine"
 FAT_battleship_focus_desc:0 "Otto Saxhagen-Plumenjar is loosely related to the Cloudburian royal family, and is technically the heir to the remnants of the dynasty. Despite his royal blood, Kemerskai kept him and his mother alive, and allowed him to become an admiral as a concession to monarchists. Otto is a strong proponent of naval forces that can squash the enemy through sheer numbers, armour, and calibre."
 FAT_destroyer_focus:0 "Hassentelf Doctrine"
 FAT_destroyer_focus_desc:0 "Hermann Hassentelf is a prominent and loyal Republican admiral, serving in the Revolution of 978 as a naval officer and being promoted to Admiral after the Long March. Due to his lack of access to battleships and carriers as an officer, he has become an expert and a strong supporter of a smaller strike fleet. He argues that battleships and too slow for fast-paced naval combat."
 FAT_submarine_focus:0 "Hit and Run"
 FAT_submarine_focus_desc:0 "Cornelius Helltalon has visited the Changeling Lands more than once, and has become convinced of their Naval Focus on the so called 'Submarine'. Using this type of vessel, Cornelius says, we will be able to raid and ambush enemy fleets as easy as pie, with no chance to be hunted down afterwards."
 FAT_navy_investment:0 "Expand Winghagen Ports"
 FAT_navy_investment_desc:0 "The City-port of Winghagen is one of the biggest cities in the Republic, not to mention that its harbours and shipyards are among the biggest in all of northern Griffonia. Nonetheless, there are obvious problems, as most of the equipment used there is obsolete. If we spared some of our funds and nationalised all shipyards there, we could easily make Winghagen into the greatest port of northern Griffonia."
 FAT_navy_doctrine:0 "Perfect Naval Doctrines"
 FAT_navy_doctrine_desc:0 "Our new Admiralty has been lost in arguments for the longest time now, unable to make up their minds on how to proceed in terms of Naval specialisation. It is time we gave them a clear direction on where we are headed with our Naval Doctrine."
 FAT_new_battleships:0 "Research Battleships"
 FAT_new_battleships_desc:0 "Battleships shall be the unquestioned rulers of naval warfare. It is clear to us that they will decide all naval battles, and as such, we should strive towards getting some of our own. A good way to start would be using our new shipyards in Winghaven to construct new battleships. There are talks about two promising projects we could develop there, the Dreadnought-class and the Atreus-class."
 FAT_new_destroyers:0 "Research Destroyers"
 FAT_new_destroyers_desc:0 "Destroyers form the backbone of every naval force in the world, and that won't change anytime soon. There are already many types of them in use, many of which are more technologically advanced then whatever we could hope to create. As such, we should buy a few of them in not-so-great-condition, take them apart, learn everything we can from them, and then use that knowledge to base our own projects on."
 FAT_new_submarines:0 "Experimental Submarine Models"
 FAT_new_submarines_desc:0 ""Submarines" are a relatively new ship prototype that can go under the water and torpedo boats without even being recognized! Our Admiralty should inspect foreign models from nations such as Equestria and eventually build some submarines for our own."
 FAT_more_navy_investment:0 "A Second Port On Sky Bay"
 FAT_more_navy_investment_desc:0 "Our only port on Sky Bay is in the city of Winghaven. However, if Winghaven gets destroyed by an enemy or even by a natural disaster, we would have no naval port to dock our ships. A port on the Feathisian border would work well to intimidate the Griffonian Empire and establish another port more south than Winghaven."
 FAT_perfect_the_saxhagen_plumenjar_doctrine:0 "Perfect The Saxhagen-Plumenjar Doctrine"
 FAT_perfect_the_saxhagen_plumenjar_doctrine_desc:0 "With new battleship designs researched, our admiralty now can perfect Admiral Saxhagen-Plumenjar's doctrine. A navy made out of dreadnoughts and battleships will humble the fleets of Feathisia and any other enemies that could think to stand against us on the seas."
 FAT_perfect_the_hassentelf_doctrine:0 "Perfect The Hassentelf Doctrine"
 FAT_perfect_the_hassentelf_doctrine_desc:0 "Hermann Hassentelf has perfected his doctrine of destroyers and cruisers. Already they are being mass produced in our dockyards and docked in our naval bases. In time, our fleets will storm through Sky Bay and overwhelm the empire's capital ships with sheer numbers and firepower."
 FAT_perfect_the_marines:0 "The Republican Marine Corps"
 FAT_perfect_the_marines_desc:0 "Now that we have superior ships, dockyards, ports, and naval bases, we can now perfect our amphibious assault tactics. The Republican Marine Corps will be formed, and we will truly rule the waves - not Skyfall, the Empire, but the Republic will rule the seas."
 FAT_new_airforce:0 "New Republican Air Forces"
 FAT_new_airforce_desc:0 "Only a few of the most powerful countries on the Griffonian continent have Air Forces, and we should do our best to join them in that. Having an efficient, large Air Force to contest the skies and aid our advance down below would greatly aid our war effort."
 FAT_fighter_focus:0 "Rule the Skies"
 FAT_fighter_focus_desc:0 "The most important part of air warfare is to have control over the skies, and as such, we should focus our efforts on creating planes that would let us do that. Our planes should be relatively small and agile, while remaining a deadly threat."
 FAT_bomber_focus:0 "Death From Above"
 FAT_bomber_focus_desc:0 "The biggest premise of this new air warfare is destroying as much of the enemy industry and infrastructure as we want. We should focus on creating planes that can carry as many bombs as possible, while allowing them to strike deep into enemy territory."
 FAT_air_doctrine:0 "Seek Foreign Expertise"
 FAT_air_doctrine_desc:0 "Seeing as how we lack our own professional pilots, we should focus our attention on establishing contacts with veterans from other nations. If we were to give enough of our funds to such pilots, they probably would be very excited and eager to work with us, and we could make them share their experience about air tactics and strategy."
 FAT_new_bombers:0 "Acquire New Bomber Blueprints"
 FAT_new_bombers_desc:0 "Foreign Pilots that have come to us from other countries sometimes brought something additional other than knowledge with them. If we were to splice everything together, we might be able to recreate working blueprints."
 FAT_new_fighters:0 "Commission New Fighters"
 FAT_new_fighters_desc:0 "Our new Pilots have asked us to commission a new set of Fighters. After a few talks and backroom deals, the pilots have helped our scientists develop new Fighter models for themselves to use."
 FAT_grand_1:0 "The Wisdom of Marshal Rosewing"
 FAT_grand_1_desc:0 "We need to plan every attack, every defence, every retreat, and every advance. We need to change our army into something reminiscent of a clockwork, where every action is well-timed and well-planned."
 FAT_grand_2:0 "Strengthen Engineer Brigades"
 FAT_grand_2_desc:0 "To make sure our units are able to follow our meticulous orders, we need to make sure they will keep their positions. As such, we should focus on adding specialised units whose main task is to fortify areas that our troops are currently occupying."
 FAT_grand_3:0 "Reshuffle Our HQ"
 FAT_grand_3_desc:0 "Our recent changes in our army have, as of now, mostly taken care of our top commanders and our units, but we haven't done anything about most of our HQ, or about less important generals. Today, this will change, as we will make sure every one of them will follow our doctrine of extensive planning."
 FAT_grand_4:0 "Sicameonese Defensive Tactics"
 FAT_grand_4_desc:0 "The Sicameonese army maintained vigilance against the Griffonian Empire for centuries, guarding itself as a decentralised republic in the face of a looming threat. When Grover I attacked in 773, they united and repelled him. We must learn from history, and adapt these tactics to form a defensive army that will make the lives of any soldiers who dare to invade us a living Tartarus."
 FAT_superior_1:0 "The Wisdom of Marshal Kemerskai"
 FAT_superior_1_desc:0 "Why waste the lives of our citizens and our commanders' ability to think independently if we could just throw hundreds, if not thousands of artillery shells at the enemy?"
 FAT_superior_2:0 "Introduce Military Police"
 FAT_superior_2_desc:0 "Our army isn't the most disciplined bunch. This has become increasingly worrying to our commanders, who now run the risk of bombarding our own troopers during artillery barrages, simply because said troopers wanted to gain glory for themselves. We must install a proper sense of order and discipline in these soldiers!"
 FAT_superior_3:0 "Dedicated Artillery Units"
 FAT_superior_3_desc:0 "With dedicated Artillery Regiments, we can more effectively coordinate Artillery bombardments with troop movements, resulting in even less friendly fire and more accurate barrages."
 FAT_superior_5:0 "Rocket Artillery"
 FAT_superior_5_desc:0 "The Empire and other nations around Griffonia seem to have a particular obsession with the "Nebelwefer" and rocket artillery. As a new form of Kemerskai's specialty, we shall embrace this new technology and bring it into the factories at once."
 FAT_superior_4:0 "The Power of Artillery"
 FAT_superior_4_desc:0 "With our amassed guns, we now have the ability to utilise the so-called 'Creeping Barrage' tactic, which we can use to scare enemies out of their hiding places before an advance."
 FAT_mass_1:0 "The Wisdom of Marshal Suntail"
 FAT_mass_1_desc:0 "While producing millions of extra shells or drawing up extensive battleplans sounds good, it is also very time intensive and not worth the effort. Instead, we should attempt to draft every able-bodied griffon, give him a gun and send him to the front. That way, we will have no shortage of troops, and we will be practically unbeatable."
 FAT_mass_2:0 "Convince Militias To Join"
 FAT_mass_2_desc:0 "There are many more or less loyal local militias roaming our country. If we could get in contact with their leaders, and hopefully offer them amnesty, riches, or just promise to grant them some enemy to shoot at, we might be able to get many of these militias to join our army as the backbone of new units."
 FAT_mass_3:0 "Amnesty For The Warlords"
 FAT_mass_3_desc:0 "Instead of offering amnesty only to leaders and officers, we will offer it to every griffon who has ever fought against us. This will surely help us bolster the ranks. "
 FAT_mass_4:0 "Redemption in Death"
 FAT_mass_4_desc:0 "We could extend our Amnesty Program to every prisoner, POW, terrible criminal, or just common thief in our Country. We will give them all the chance to redeem themselves, no matter what crimes they have committed, so long as they agree to fight in our ranks."
 FAT_an_academy_in_the_north:0 "Lostgate Military Academy"
 FAT_an_academy_in_the_north_desc:0 "While Cloudbury has many military schools, the north is severely lacking in academies teaching military strategy. To rectify this, the [Root.GetName] has created the "Lostgate Military Academy", which will provide training in tactics and strategy to generals and researches in the north."
 FAT_marshal_rifle:0 "Retake Control of the Stockpiles"
 FAT_marshal_rifle_desc:0 "If there is ample amount of something in our country, it would be guns. From all the conflicts that took place recently, and also because of the increased militarisation in general, it isn’t even that hard to find places with unguarded stockpiles of them. By regaining control over these vast amounts of stockpiles, we could use the weapons to bolster and arm the ranks of the Army."
 FAT_marshal_rifle_quality:0 "Quality Over Quantity"
 FAT_marshal_rifle_quality_desc:0 "After gathering this many guns, our military staff has realised that the Quantity of guns doesn't matter if the gun itself is faulty and outdated. We will instead use our expertise to create better, higher quality weapons."
 FAT_marshal_rifle_quantity:0 "All Griffons To The Factories"
 FAT_marshal_rifle_quantity_desc:0 "All you need to fight a bad guy is a gun. And if that don't work, use more gun."
 FAT_arty:0 "Modernise Artillery Guns"
 FAT_arty_desc:0 "Now that our troops are properly equipped with rifles, we need to turn our attention towards bigger calibre artillery guns. If we were to use the experience we have gathered while working on the carbines, it's quite possible we would be able to greatly improve our current design."
 FAT_sup:0 "Reorganise Support Units"
 FAT_sup_desc:0 "While the frontline troops are the main heroes, we mustn't forget about the support units in our army, who make sure everygriff has ammunition and supplies. To ensure just this, we must reorganise their support battalions into a more effect unit."
 FAT_magic_equip:0 "Utilize the Crystals"
 FAT_magic_equip_desc:0 "Using magical crystals, we are able to create an entirely new kind of gun, one that isn't using ballistic energy but magic instead. Such guns might revolutionise the very nature of warfare. Our lands are rich with the crystals needed to power these weapons, so it would be a waste not to use them effectively."
 FAT_radar:0 "Equestrian Radar Technology"
 FAT_radar_desc:0 "Equestrian scientists have developed the RADAR, technology able to see enemies before they even arrive for battle. With our industry beginning to use crystals and Equestrian engineering, perhaps we should also take another page from the book of Equestrian warfare and develop RADAR technology."
 FAT_winter_training:0 "Braving The Cloudbury Winters"
 FAT_winter_training_desc:0 "The Cloudbury winters were some of the harshest in all of Griffonia, and even though we have been here for some 30 years, many of our troops still have not acclimated. It is time to truly begin winter training, so that our armies can defend against unprepared Imperial forces from the South, just as Cloudbury did during our assault."
 FAT_mountain_training:0 "Braving The Cloudbury Mountains"
 FAT_mountain_training_desc:0 "It is time to learn some tactics from the natives and train our troops in the warfare of the Cloudbury mountains and the mountains in Northern Strawberry and Whitetail. If we are to defeat the Imperials, we must learn to use these vital strategic positions in both defence and offence."
 FAT_heavy_tanks:0 "Heavy Tanks"
 FAT_heavy_tanks_desc:0 "Now that we have begun tank research, it is time to look into heavier tank designs, that will allow us to truly challenge Imperial dominance in the industry and their fierce mobile warfare doctrine."
 FAT_motorized_equip:0 "Mechanise our Army"
 FAT_motorized_equip_desc:0 "While Trucks are an incredibly valuable and effective vehicle to use for transport of troops and supplies, it is also quite evident that they are vulnerable to any sort of incoming fire.

 FAT_socialist_democracy:0 "The Principle Of Socialist Democracy"
 FAT_socialist_democracy_desc:0 "The third principle of the Republic was Democracy. This is perhaps the most outlandish claim of the Republic, as it never truly had democracy.

 kingfeather_desc:0 "If you asked a Republican citizen what Heinrich Kingfeather, arguably the second most powerful griffon in the Republic, has done in the last 4 years, despite his vast agenda, they would be unable to tell you anything.\n\nHeinrich Kingfeather was born in 949 ALB in Greengate, Yale. Trained in law and economics, the young Kingfeather did not seem like a suitable candidate for a revolutionary leader at all, but his progressive legal precedents led him to become one of Republicanism's staunchest defenders. As a lawyer and politician first and revolutionary second, Kingfeather advocated for Republicanism at the international level, attempting numerous deals with both Equestria and the River Coalition - both who largely denied his advances. His legal and political action during Kemerskai's term eased public instability and anger at the Republicans, but it could not save the revolution militarily.\n\nKingfeather, instead of participating in the Long March, fled to Skyfall and then the newly independent City of Fezera, before finally arriving in the Republic to cheering crowds after its control over Cloudbury was secured. Although his inability to support the Republicans in the Long March was a point of disapproval for many, Kingfeather continued to represent the people of the Republic in their new seat in Cloudbury.\n\nKingfeather's work has largely been behind the scenes since he became Kemerskai's second-in-command in 1003, replacing ambitious militarist Schnabel Sunglider with a focus on largely domestic issues. Faced with an unruly military and banditry in the countryside, Kingfeather began to construct a policy that countered Sunglider's beliefs of violent reaction to dissidence. Kingfeather met with hundreds of native leaders in acts that helped mend the complete chaos in the countryside following Rosewing's initial agitation, acts that led him to become one of the most pro-native leaders on the national level. Pragmatism was Kingfeather's main goal, a goal that became more and more difficult with the polarization of the country between political and ethnic lines.\n\nWill he ever succeed? Or will he die with all the cards in his claws and no bravery to use them, as his opposition claims?"

 griffonRepublic.18.d:0 "General Rosewing is one of the most prominent warlords in the republic. While his troops and mandate are supported by the government itself, he seems to only act more independently of the high command everyday, with his forces even raiding local encampments of troops loyal to us. Today, the Republican army held a meeting with Rosewing, in which he claimed he had nothing to do with the raids, and that his regiments had strict punishments for raiding anyway, so there would be no precedent for raiding in his regime. He blamed the entirety of the problems with the unruly army on Suntail and a few unruly soldiers within his army, saying that he had always been loyal to the republic and he would never do such a thing."
 griffonRepublic.18.a:0 "An interesting conversation."
 
 griffonRepublic.19.t:0 "A Meeting with Suntail"
 griffonRepublic.19.d:0 "General Suntail is an incredibly controversial public figure. At 17, he joined the Republican Army and participated in the revolution that brought an end to the Griffonian monarchy. As the years have gone on, however, he has become more radical and more disillusioned with the Republican dream. Having a meeting with the most dangerous griffon in Griffonia was no small task, but at the end, Suntail demanded 3 major concessions. His first demand was the legalization of the National Revolutionary Front, an underground ultranationalist organization that was convicted of multiple terrorist attacks in 1003 and subsequently banned. The second demand was the pardoning of all raiders, except the radical ones, which he claimed he would "sort out" on his own. The third demand was millions of idols for his troops to "supply"."

 griffonRepublic.199.t:0 "The Generals Submit"
 griffonRepublic.199.d:0 "Rosewing and Suntail have come to the Cloudbury with their most prominent officers on direct order of President-Marshal Kemerskai. The details of the meeting were completely obscured to the people, but journalists believed it was a discussion to finally end the question of banditry in the countryside. Reporters from the Cloudbury Times claimed they saw "Rosewing and Kemerskai walking out of the Presidential palace, shaking claws and talking vigorously." It appears that Rosewing and Suntail have finally sworn their oaths to the Republic never to undergo banditry again."

After a short exchange of fire, that left few of our soldiers wounded and dead, they had managed to storm their defences, and as soon as that has happened, all of Rosewing soldiers, with him included, had mass-capitulated to our forces."

 griffonRepublic.20.t:0 "The Bandit Problem"
 griffonRepublic.20.d:0 "Ever since the establishment of our Republic, bandits, marauders, and other criminals were a true problem for everyone not living in the middle of a big city, many years had passed since, but they had stayed a strong thorn against our government. But that has recently changed, as we now put more of our attention on bringing them down, and we can at least guarantee that major roads and communication paths are safe from them. Yet we cannot stop now, there are still smaller and bigger villages and cities being terrorised by them, and many of smaller roads are still infested with that pest."

Our campaign to eradicate them was hard and bloody, but it has payed off in the end, and most of our citizens can now sleep soundly, as we made sure that remnants of once great gangs, bands, and groups had been driven into hiding. But we cannot make a mistake here, even though they hide in forests, and in less scrupulous parts of our cities, they could still return to their old ways if we won't push them even harder."

It's quite an interesting end to our campaign, seeing how 'Priesthood' was the first criminal organisation in the Republic. With their end, an age in the history of our country ends. Where once was lawlessness, now there is order, where once every well meaning griff was afraid to go out at night, now you can meet all kinds of merry griffons celebrating whatever occasion, or just having fun together, where once most of the roads had to be travelled together with armed escort, now you can see lone mothers with children going on about their day, more then sure about their safety."

 griffonRepublic.42.d:0 "Today some truly terrifying reports have reached Cloudbury. It seems that some of smaller villages, and cities are reporting that they aren't getting enough of food delivered to them. It's nothing that surprising considering that our countryside is in chaos, but if we won't be able to fix that, this could lead to some truly worrying consequences."

 griffonRepublic.43.t:0 "The State of the Countryside"
 griffonRepublic.43.d:0 "The Situation in the countryside is bone-chilling, as it seems that previous reports weren't overblown, and were true. What is worse, at this point most of the farmers and places that produce food either keep it for themselves, or sell it privately at greatly inflated prices. And any transports of food are already at great risk of being raided by greedy bandits, or just by starving and desperate griffons. If we wish not to have a catastrophe in our Republic, we should do something."
 griffonRepublic.43.a:0 "Send armed guards together with transports, inspect every mill and every farm for suspicious surplus of food."
 
 griffonRepublic.44.t:0 "Famine Recovery"
 griffonRepublic.44.d:0 "Since the start of our efforts aimed at stopping, and making the famine less deadly, we have managed to help countless griffons, and to keep many more from dying. While situation isn't perfect now, more and more farms and mills are returning to their usual production quotas. But it will still take time before we can safely let things run on their own, especially since there is still few places where hunger is a very real danger to everyone."
 griffonRepublic.44.a:0 "Focus on making everything returning to work as normal."
 
 griffonRepublic.45.t:0 "Famine is Over"
 griffonRepublic.45.d:0 "Today marks the day when the famine has ended, and our food supply is as good as never before. It wasn't easy, and we sadly have to count death in thousands, but this must serve as a warning to us all, that we shouldn't let ever again for such chaos to run wild among in countryside. And as such, our policies of soldiers escorting supply trains, and that of inspections, are here to stay."

 griffonRepublic.50.t:0 "Vedina Question"
 griffonRepublic.50.d:0 "Vedina is a monarchy, the same sort that we had tried to destroy in the year 978, and yet they are probably the only monarchy on the entire Griffonian continent that cares about every single one of their citizens. The king acts as an administrator of the realm, and treats every griffon with the same rights, even if they are a commoner.\n\nOf course, that is what Kingfeather's band would want you to believe. Many in the Republic have expressed doubts at Vedina's so-called "harmonic system" and their lack of true liberties, citing that they are a monarchy the same as Cloudbury or the Imperials, and they must be destroyed."
 griffonRepublic.50.a:0 "Perhaps an accord can be made..."
 griffonRepublic.50.b:0 "It is regrettable, but it must be done."
 
 griffonRepublic.51.t:0 "We have been invited to a faction by [FAT.GetName]"
 griffonRepublic.51.d:0 "Today we had been invited to a common faction by [FAT.GetName], they are a republican break-away state from the Griffonian Empire. And they are one of not many nations around us who really gives a damn about the griffons they rule, even if their management isn't the most efficient one. We should take note however, that they are republican to the very depth of their hearts, and as such, if we would refuse, it could anger them into doing something unwise. Yet, at same time, agreeing to getting a common faction with them, while beneficial to common folk, could drag us into a bloody and long war with some of the monarchies around."

 griffonRepublic.52.a:0 "A reasonable, freedom loving King? This calls for celebration."
 
 griffonRepublic.53.t:0 "Vedina Refuses"
 griffonRepublic.53.d:0 "As could have been expected, Vedina has disagreed to join our faction, calling us warmongers, and telling us that we would cause thousands of deaths, just for political gains. As always, these are typical monarchist lies, still, it's a bit disappointing that supposedly such a wise and caring king would not agree to join us. But in the end, all monarchies are the same, and this only further proves it."
 griffonRepublic.53.a:0 "Kings will be kings. We will liberate people of Vedina soon enough."
 
 griffonRepublic.54.t:0 "The Bell Tolls For Us"
 griffonRepublic.54.d:0 "After [FAT.GetName] had defeated the Griffonian Empire, and now they are demanding for every state in Griffonia to join their republic. If we would do that, we would have to say goodbye to any of our independence, but otherwise... we might be risking war with The Republic, and that could be very dangerous, or very bloody."

 griffonRepublic.54.b:0 "We won't give our independence away to some silly republican pretenders."
 
 griffonRepublic.55.t:0 "Pretender State Agrees on Integration"
 griffonRepublic.55.d:0 "One of the many pretender-state that was born out of the ineptness of the empire has agreed to join us as a republic member state, we give them right to limited autonomy, and having their own elected leaders, but they are our allies and stand together with us when it comes to: Foreign Policy, Military, Science, and Economy. "
 griffonRepublic.55.a:0 "Very good, one potential tyrannical dictatorship less."

 griffonRepublic.60.d:0 "From a rundown suburb of our fair capital comes an invention which will change the lives of many. A simple school griffon has come up with a completely new way of writing down Herzlander using new methods of printing, and it is assumed that Cloudburian will soon follow as a compatible language. The method involves printing repeating patterns of dots onto paper, yet these dots do not use any ink at all. The new printer pushes small bumps into the paper.\n\n What use is this? Well, up until now the blind have been unable to read. Yet the inventor, who is blind himself, professes this new technique allows blind griffons to read. The invention has taken the education establishment by storm and two different schools for the blind have just opened in our capital."

 griffonRepublic.61.d:0 "Reports have come in of a strange sighting from Lake Gråsten near the city of Squark. Apparently, a group of local youths were having a party at the edge of the lake when they discovered the body of a diamond dog, mauled and torn by claws, daggers, and bullets. Witnesses identified him as Cadworth, a diamond dog street musician and performance artist part of a reclusive community of northern diamond dogs. When they reported it to the Squark police, a city-wide investigation was launched, eventualy finding the culprits - a gang of griffons associated with the "Society Against Monarchist Tyranny", who had murdered him due to "crypto-monarchism and a desire to restore Grover VI to the throne of Cloudbury". The Society's griffons found themselves imprisoned, with lawyer and politician Heinrich Kingfeather demanding they be given harsh sentences for their lynching of the dog. Erich Kreiger, an industrialist and militarist minister, however, believed that the attacks "were somewhat justified, as the scourge of monarchism must not be allowed in our just society".\n\nThe killing of Cadworth has sparked mass media attention, and while most politicians have officially condemned it, the killing still has damaged anti-monarchist elements in the nation."

 griffonRepublic.62.d:0 "Scandal shook the nation today as news began to report rumours that the Left-NRP City Councilgriff of Cloudbury, Jakub Poulsen, was involved in an affair with a prostitute. If this wasn't embarrassing enough, the prostitute in question, whose identity has remained anonymous throughout the scandal was reportedly a known spy for the United Socialist Revolutionary Front of Skynavia, and has since fled the nation with vital state secrets. Fears over collusion between Poulsen and the Skynavian government have led to widespread panic in the government, and Heinrich Kingfeather, leader of the Right-NRP, has already called for the City Councilgriff to resign, citing "unclear loyalties towards the great Republican dream".\n\nWhile Left-NRP leader Rikard Astler has largely kept silent on the matter, socialist-aligned general Moe Sparrowsbane has released a statement - and although he completely ignores the matter of Skynavian secrets, declares that the act of prostitution is "immoral and incompatible with the values of socialism and liberation". Interestingly, despite antagonism from all sides of the political sphere, Jakub Poulsen has denied any claims of ill conduct, but has resigned anyway.\n\nRight-NRP leaders have been galvanized by Poulsen's unloyal and vile conduct, claiming that a full state investigation must be made into the actions of the party and whether it is truly compromised by Skynavian interests."

Kemerskai's second principle - Democracy, was replaced with Nationalism, the belief that the revolution must encompass all Griffons, and that the Republic should embody a patriotic, ultranationalist movement. The crowds still cheered for Suntail's reforms, but they were cheering for an amalgamation of the original three principles.

The social democrats would be sure to reach across to both the right and the left to forge a centrist Republic.\n\nThe right-wing, represented by the [Root.GetNeutralParty], has put forth a mandate of continuing capitalism, although the militarists under their banner have more centrally planned theories. Supporting a free Republic under the principles of Liberty, Democracy, and Prosperity, the Right has put forth broad non-interventionist economic plans and a focus on centralizing the Republic."

Whitefeather's troops seized most of the northern Republic, allying with conservative leader Heinrich Kingfeather. The rebellion is also thought to have spread into areas of Skynavia, where Governor Asper Sickleclaw has pledged his full loyalty to the Republic in the troubles against the Whitefeather regime. Kemerskai has delivered a speech to the people of the nation, declaring that the Republic will never perish from this earth, and ended his speech with the line "While cowards flinch and traitors sneer, we'll keep the tricolour flying here!", a reference to a popular patriotic song, "The Tricolour."

Led by Heinrich Kingfeather, who supported Kemerskai's suspension of the constitution and despotic government.\n\n If not purged from our government, the party could pose a threat to our new democratic socialist government.

With almost twenty years of banditry, chaos, and political instability due to Kemerskai's suspension of the 978 Constitution in 986, opposition forces have risen considerably in power, especially socialists.\n\nOne such opposition politician, Rikard Astler, has rallied the left behind a new wing of the NRP, one that is socialist but still subscribes to the principles of bourgeois democracy, unlike the systems put forward in Skynavia or proposed by revolutionaries in Prywhen. Astler's democratic socialist ideals have quickly gained support as many no longer trust Kemerskai to actually bring Republicanism to the people.\n\nSocialist councillors have begun a plan to rally the people under their banner, and wish for an eventual vote of no confidence against Kemerskai's regime. Many believe that this would result in an openly socialist President-Marshal such as Astler and maybe even the end of the hated martial law."

Brawls in the streets are common between Suntail's fascists and ultranationalists against Rosewing's natives and monarchists.\n\n Supporters of Rosewing advocate for a monarchy, whether it be constitutional or autocratic. His support mostly comes from natives in the north, and his supporters claim that a monarchy will bring about the stability that the Republic never gave them. In addition, a strong monarchic leader would not be prone to the chaos of the National Republican Party, and would quickly be able to act on poverty and banditry in the North, which would be their main power base.\n\n Suntail is perhaps the more dangerous one. His supporters, originally banned years ago due to a series of anti-government terrorist attacks, known as the National Revolutionary Front, want to establish a Griffonian Republic, take Griffenheim, and destroy the old vestiges of monarchy. But instead of a democratic regime like Kemerskai, they want to establish a true national republic, in which the oligarchy is destroyed and wealth is given to the people, as long as they serve the state and Suntail.\n\n Suntail's ultranationalist, populist, and revanchist ideology may prove a danger to Rosewing's conservatism, and it is beginning to attract the lower classes. But can Rosewing use his veteranship and political connections among the natives and the northerners to secure power?"

Rosewing's reluctance to seize full control has now cost him, as the stern, traditional, griffon soon found himself at the end of a firing squad. An hour after the summary execution of Rosewing, Suntail's forces officially marched on the military council, demanding the council surrender complete power to Suntail and the Griffonian National Revolutionary Front. The council conceded, and swore Suntail in as President and Marshal of the Griffonian Republic.\n\nSuntail's policy is radical and dangerous, and many believe it to be the natural end to the failed system of Kemerskai's old Republic. Suntail's fanatic anti-native and anti-monarchist views have left Rosewing's previous supporters fearing for their lives, and his devotion to the National Republican cause is perhaps greater than Kemerskai's love for the Three Principles.\n\n"A great war against the Griffonian Empire shall soon commence, my brothers and sisters, which will bring about a new dawn for Griffonia and the Republic," Suntail spoke in his inauguration speech, "We shall accomplish what the decadent marshal could never do, and truly bring the Three Principles to Griffenheim, under a strong and glorious banner!""

Rosewing's politics differ from the radical Suntail. He is a more conservative figure, loyal to the monarchies of old, such as the Duchy of Cloudbury, which he believes was and will be a better government then Kemerskai's. Rosewing himself has sympathies toward constitutional monarchy, fighting in the Revolution of 978 and still harboring loyalty toward democracy and liberalism. Rosewing's economic policy? Much of the same of Kemerskai's. Strong, social-democratic development will be kept, and with a strong monarch, countryside raiding and banditry wil be annihilated. He is also associated with the old guard of the military, and dislikes both ultranationalism and socialism, believing them to be toxic and extremist."

Generals who had previously supported the revolution against Kemerskai now found themselves in a jail cell by the very person they had once fought for, such as the traitor Max Whitefeather, who had supported the tyrant Rosewing through and through. Responding to mass popular suspicion, Suntail held a speech in Winghagen, a seat of liberal and traditionalist attitudes towards the Republic, where he claimed that the purges were "necessary for the stability for the republic," and that they would allow him to bring about "a republic for the people, not ruled by vicious oligarchs and foolhardy pragmatists.""

This behavior is unacceptable, and must be stopped. However, there are two solutions to such a thing. Schnabel Sunglider, a political idealist and one of Kemerskai's closest advisors, says that the military should be rebuilt and the rebellious commanders sacked, so that the military will be at the same standard of the Griffonian army. Heinrich Kingfeather, ever the pragmatist, has dismissed this, claiming that the best course of action is the swiftest, merely placating the generals and going on with the Republican regime like clockwork."

The celebration was complete with a professional band lended from Skyfall for an obscene price, its members sporting fancier suits than the Duke himself. When he reached the parliamentary building, a 21-gun salute was given by the military of the Duchy of Cloudbury.\n\n However, in the homes of most citizens, the atmosphere was very different. The people of the Republic showed disbelief and skepticism. Years after the revolution had been brought north, and Duke Otto Plumenjar was lynched along with his wife Freja, the monarchy was being restored again. Trumpets blared and griffon soldiers paraded across the streets, but there was only a small amount of applause from the crowd, and even those who applauded cared little for the new monarchy. It would take time for the people to grow accustomed to this new regime, a regime that seemed to defy everything the Republic was built on.\n\nIn a speech to the local populace, Duke Oskar emphasized the need to "bring back the idea of a monarchy into the hearts and minds of these corrupted Griffons", and claimed that "the Republican Revolution was the greatest disaster to ever behold Griffonia, and left this land in complete anarchy. It was no doubt the gravest event in the last century." Republican leader Heinrich Kingfeather, in exile in the Kingdom of Vedina, wrote Oskar a strongly worded letter, telling him to "get his inbred group of goats out of this nation before the people lynch you like they did your bastard father"."

In a radio address to the people, Kemerskai emphasized that the nation would return to civilian rule after the Imperial threat was contained, but also claimed he would not attack the Empire directly, saying that would be "suicide". Given that Kemerskai's emergency both lasts until the Imperial threat is contained but also given that he does not plan to attack the Imperials directly, it appears that the emergency will be almost indefinite."

Kogchel and Astler also made alliances with Erich Mühschnabel and Cyrusval university, a radical but quite "armchair" group of socialists.

 griffonRepublic.217.d:0 "In a radio address heard by millions across the nation, President Schnabel Sunglider announced his new plan for the nation - harmony with republican characterists. In his address, Sunglider denounced the Equestrian monarchy for its inherently autocratic nature, where the two ruling ponies were not limited by any constitution and were even treated like deities by the common populace. The only thing preventing the immortal alicorns from abusing power was their benevolent nature, but that could easily change, and any successor to the throne was not guaranteed to be as kind as them. He then compared this to the system of divine right which the Griffonian Empire used to justify its legitimacy. In Sunglider's eyes, these two monarchies were one and the same - they were both unconstitutional empires that used religious undertones to convince the people into supporting them.\n\nSunglider's new plan, harmony with republican characteristics, would solve this by implementing "true democracy". A constitution would guarantee the right to free national elections and would implement a separation of powers, preventing abuse of power by any single body of government. Harmonic values themselves would be integral to the constitution as well, securing basic rights for all sentient beings in the republic and forbidding unharmonic things such as hate speech and sowing of dissent among the populace. Instead of a decentralized system of local democracies overseen by a ruler who can intervene at will, the new modern harmony would mean a strong, united republic founded on rule of law alone."

Any griffon should be able to start their own business and achieve their own dream, but in recent years, this has been sorely lacking, and poverty has only increased. To rectify this, we must continue welfare programs and tax cuts on former Griffonian peasants, ensuring them a living wage and a life free from the poverty the Imperials imposed on them. To pay for these ambitious new social programs, we will hike taxes on the former nobles of the lands, and conduct land reform and even seizure on underworked lands controlled by Griffonian oligarchs.

Socialists believe that the NRP's principle of prosperity is incompatible with the conservative wing of the party, while the conservatives believe the socialists are undermining the principle of liberty with their anti-free market stance. With harmonists and democrats mostly in the middle, they have tried hard to mend the divide and assure both sides that the values of the Republic are being protected, but to no avail. Sometimes, parliament members even brawled with their fellow partygriffs due to conflicts in economic stances! With the climate growing more polarized by the day, we risk a splinter wing forming off the NRP, and undermining our legitimacy.

He has seen the death of his comrades, the lie of "peaceful harmony". "Peaceful harmony" has only given Sunglider the glory of seeing monarchist boots trample over his comrades, his friends. No. He will not stand and watch as dictatorships still rule in Griffonia. Now that he has the resources to attack the monarchies of the land, he will do so, and the brave Republican people will march on in pursuit of the three principles.

On the international level, Wingbardy, Aquileia, Prywhen, and Griffonstone lurk in the south, all waiting to strike at our republic. The socialists and monarchists of the south plot in secret, making alliances and forging pacts against the Republic, wanting the vast riches of the Heartlands for themselves. Within our nation, socialists strike at our decade-old democracy, disregarding the principle of liberty with their beliefs in broad nationalizations and destruction of our free market, capitalist system. Their policies would no doubt collapse our economy and weaken our democracy, allowing their smily, charismatic leaders to sully our Republic and abolish republican rule under the false pretense of "restoring order". We, the NRP, understand what this Republic must become - a constitutional Republic, free from the evils of socialism, monarchy, or dictatorship."

 griffonRepublic.222.d:0 "The economy of the Griffonian Republic has long been based on social-democratic principles. One of Kemerskai's major goals was to create a Griffonian welfare state, that would care for all griffons and guarantee them a home, food, and family. However, conservative economists in the government of Heinrich Kingfeather predict that our nation will fall into economic collapse with too much welfare spending, and that interest rates on Griffonian currency across the nation will spike! We cannot have this, and must roll back welfare reforms, instead relying on the meritocratic forces on the free market, which would ensure that griffons all had a chance to achieve as much wealth as possible. There will be no more burdensome regulations on the people of the Republic, nor welfare programs that condemn griffons to lives of decadence as they scrounge off government benefits. No! We will have a free market, capitalist economy, without the meddlings of socialism!"

This faction, after finding themselves independent from the most powerful political party in all of Griffonia, initially splintered into many different warring factions. Eventually, days later, Rikard Astler formed the Socialist Party of Griffonia, uniting syndicalists, democratic socialists, and even disaffected social democrats in a large, big-tent, socialist party. With socialists purged from the party, the NRP has shifted to the right, and it will be much easier for us to pass our capitalist reforms. With a legal opposition, we can also begin further democratization of the Republic. The creation of a socialist opposition will be a stepping stone to the eventual building of a multi-party system."

 griffonRepublic.224.d:0 "Hundreds of pardons were granted to nobles, soldiers, and citizens across the nation who had once served with the Griffonian Empire, even more than were granted by President-Marshal Kemerskai after his democratic reforms. Civil servants from the Empire were quickly re-assigned all across the Republic in the nations they had once served, instead of rotting in the dungeons that the radicals would have them in for the rest of their lives. From Angriver to Feathisia, remaining nobles were freed, given a slap on the claw, and welcomed into the Griffonian Republic in the name of unity, healing, and progress.\n\nIn response to criticism from radical leftist elements in the National Republican Party, Kingfeather stated that "their blind lust for vengeance has clouded their judgement for a better Griffonia." According to Kingfeather and numerous politicians associated with the Right-NRP, "Plan Unity" would restore progress to Griffonia through systematic reconciliation efforts with Imperial politicians, along with industrial development aided by contacts with nobles and industrialists across the former Empire.\n\nTruly, unity has been restored to the fragile Republic - and rational policy has triumphed over the vengeance of Sunglider and Astler."

 griffonRepublic.225.d:0 "The first pan-griffonian elections have been the most contested in the history of the Republic - with parties other than the National Republican Party allowed to participate, many candidates have created new parties and cast their lot in to become the next President of the Republic.\n\nThe most left-wing groups have attracted major support from labour unions, workers, and the unemployed. With a democratic socialist policy, they advocate for major welfare reforms, expansion of cooperatives, and industrial democracy. Rikard Astler espouses these same values while being a member of the NRP, but there is also Gerben Kogchel - whose life in the Grand Duchy of Feathisia has given him a devotion to democratic values, though his connections with anarchists and revolutionary socialists during the Empire's regency crisis have not been overlooked.\n\nThe social democrats, led by Genevieve Guildedwing, a Skyfall-based social democrat and populist, have also gained critical support from the workers. Her experiences with the unregulated capitalism of Skyfall's oligarchy will make her a candidate who understands the plight of the common folk. She will no doubt establish progressive taxes and transform the Republic into a welfare state, although if she is already ruling Skyfall, there is a low chance she will actually come close to the presidency.\n\nThe Centre-NRP is led by Theodore Verany and Schnabel Sunglider, both griffons very similar to the President-Marshal. An Aquileian revolutionary who fought in multiple revolutions against the corrupt Discret dynasty, Verany is dedicated to the principles of republicanism and harmony, and Schnabel, the famed general and idealist of the Republic, is perhaps as well-renowned. \n\nOf course, there are always those of the capitalist parties and the Right-NRP. Gallo Ventriglio, a Wingbardian liberal and capitalist, who is a major proponent of laissez-faire economics and friendship with Equestria, has taken a stand as a prominent liberal-democrat, while Heinrich Kingfeather, a member of the Right-NRP, has staunchly aligned himself with Gallo's new movement.\n\nThe final group of politicians, the Militarists, are led by Kemerskai's own son, Alexander Kemerskai Jr., a staunch Republican. Alexander supports centralizing the Republic, strengthening the positions of the president, and making sure that the government is efficient and populist. Opponents say his government would be dictatorial, though he laughs off those accusations."

Kemerskai's government cannot afford to send troops into the North, with even brigades loyal to Kemerskai unwilling to fight in the mountains of the North against the armies of Suntail and Rosewing.

However, with this new move, our generals are sure that the Republicans will no longer be a threat to the Duchy of Cloudbury.\n\nGenerals loyal to Kemerskai such as Schnabel Sunglider were offered safe immigration back to Cloudbury, although whether they will continue to serve in the army has not been decided yet. In addition, parliamentarians such as Heinrich Kingfeather and Tobias Sivenhof, conservative and centrist members of the NRP, were also given free immigration back to the Republic, and they will be allowed to participate in upcoming parliamentary elections, which will be held "in the future", according to the Duke.

Astler's policies include the development of civilian factories and infrastructure, along with meetings with Republican resistance officials to solve the problems of poor army and civilian integration with the native population.\n\nThe next candidate, an internationalist, is Moe Sparrowsbane, the general who masterminded the pro-Skynavian revolt against the Republic and supported socialist resistance efforts against Kemerskai's rule. As chairgriffon, he would surely institute policies of militarization and crackdowns on the Republican resistance. Believing the Republicans to be reactionaries after their abolishment of the constitution and distance from their socialist allies, Sparrowsbane is not afraid to get his claws dirty with the Republicans.\n\nSparrowsbane and Astler have different policies, but both are committed to the Skynavian cause and socialism, and both are a safe choice for our influence in the region."

Such a solution would be as unjust as it would be absurd, and ironically it seems that the solution lies within a monarchy, or rather a diarchy.\n\nThe nation of Equestria has come to our aid, offering to shelter the young griffon. They will give him a new home, education and - hopefully - a new purpose in his life. It would be an adequate dumping ground for the prince, and Equestria has - for all its political failings - a reliable enough diplomatic standing that we can most likely trust them to not use him against us.\n\nAs young Grover is escorted down to the docks, where a ship is waiting for him, the old adage that "a compromise leaves everyone equally unhappy" comes to mind. The hardliners sees it as betraying the republican cause, the remaining monarchists sees it as another atrocity.

All of them have been judged as traitors to the Griffonian Republic and to the process of an impartial faith - the new question, however, is who shall be their replacements.\n\nA faction of Republicans led by civil servant Olaf Restjen has advocated for restoring an impartial temple and appointing only the most theological and talented prelates and priests to fill the role of the new Archons. A prominent priest of Boreas from Feathisia, Mart Biemolt, is the favorite of Restjen's faction - would he take power, he would be crowned as Aurum VI, Archon of Boreas.\n\nHowever, many have taken issue with Aurum VI and his so-called "impartiality". Walter Emerich, confidante of Schnabel Sunglider and prominent Republican general, has declared that any "impartial" priest is one who would sell off the Republic to counter-revolutionaries at a moment's notice. Instead, Emerich has advocated for the crowning of Arthur Klempner of Whitetail, who he claims is more loyal to the Republican and democratic cause. Klempner's reformism has been viewed as destructive by many in the temples, but he is the perfect Archon for the Republic's cause - would he come into power, he would become Vulgaris I, the Archon of the common griffon."

Both candidates support Kemerskai's vision, but they each have their own views on executive power, the constitution, and the people. Of course, there is already the obvious candidate - our current president, who united all of Griffonia under the National Republican Party.

 griffonRepublic.250.d:0 "After declaring complete martial law, President-Marshal Kemerskai has begun to purge socialist and dissident elements from the nation in an effort not seen since the Skynavian Revolution of 986. Socialists, labour union leaders, and even some harmonists found themselves either exiled from the NRP, exiled from the Republic all together, or even jailed and put on trial for the crime of pro-Skynavian treason.\n\nPerhaps the most egregious anti-government force after the martial law was the Socialist Wing of Kemerskai's very own National Republican Party, who held protest after protest calling for "democracy" and "free elections". Rikard Astler pranced around the streets, gathering hundreds of workers to rally against the Kemerskai regime day after day, and call for the social reform and progress expected of the Republican Revolution from the very beginning were becoming a severe threat to the Griffonian Republic. Although the party itself has not begun to face much of the intended effects of the purges, the great Marshal has viewed it key to deter against possible socialist attacks in the future.\n\nStern warnings have been given to all members of the Left-NRP on the laws of the Republic and the party they have chosen to assimilate, and more and more police have been seen on the streets of Cloudbury, arresting fascists, socialists, and communists who have shown previous disloyalty to the Republic."

His message was met with positive reception, and Vinke's book soon became a bestseller in the Republic.\n\nWhile our government tried to ban this vile work of fiction, Vinke had created enough unrest to incite mass protests against the President-Marshal, even in the North, where military junta support was strong. Unfortunately, more and more griffons are taking to the streets, with slogans like "Down with Kemerskai" and "Down with Authoritarianism".\n\nOur government will have to deal with this new crisis, or face extinction."

The generals had been crushed, and it was assumed that the North would regain their staunch loyalty to the President-Marshal.\n\nWe were wrong.\n\nPro-Skynavian militant Moe Sparrowsbane, originally loyal to the Republic, has turned tail, and established his own commune in the North of the Republic. There, he is smuggling in more and more Skynavian weapons in hopes of an armed revolution.\n\nWith a general of Sparrowsbane's power and influence in the North, and mass protests in Winghagen, Bleakspire, and Cloudbury, we must take action quickly."

In the past weeks, agents and army officers loyal to Kemerskai have begun a full investigation of socialist activity and imprisonments of those known to have committed pro-Skynavian treason.\n\nTribunals and trials were set up across the nation, and to no surprise to the loyal citizens of the Republic, numerous Left-NRP individuals and allies, such as the perfidious trade unions, were found to have colluded with the Skynavian government in order to subvert the Republic. According to our agents, Rikard Astler himself received thousands of idols from Skynavian-aligned trade unions and revolutionary organizations - truly an example of his treason against the Republic.\n\nWhen the trials concluded, no Left-NRP leader was secure - most were imprisoned, exiled, or for the best of them, simply had their career in politics ended."

There were no celebrations when Alexander Kemerskai drove through the streets of Cloudbury this time - only fear and paranoia.\n\nArmed troops entered tavern cellars, restaurants, and warehouses across Cloudbury, searching and interrogating on who was behind the rebellions and increased unrest against Kemerskai's regime. Kemerskai spoke at the Cloudbury presidential palace, as he always did, but his speech was met with only a small smattering of the populace, not the huge crowds he was accustomed too. He kept his speech short, only speaking of the traitor Rikard Astler, who had been removed from his post to be replaced by a military governor, and that from now on, Cloudbury was under martial law."

The Republican military had fought against warlord forces here before, and this time, they were much more acclimated to the winter terrain than Sparrowsbane's brigades ever were. Republican troops trudged across the icy snow, commanded by Max Whitefather himself - Kemerskai had chosen the aging griffon for his sheer hatred of Skynavian socialism and experience in the North with Rosewing's brigades. Whitefeather's troops soon found themselves in Bleakspire, where they met a large force of socialist, revolutionary, and Skynavian-aligned workers, armed with rifles and shovels.\n\nWhitefeather showed them no mercy.\n\nWhen he returned to Kemerskai, he simply told the old marshal that the deed was done, and Sparrowsbane's troops would no longer challenge the Republic any longer. Kemerskai did not bother to ask the old griff what had occured there, for he knew before he even walked in that Whitefeather had butchered the socialist rebels with the force expected of the Republican military. That, to the old marshal, was justice - justice deserved for the crimes of 986 that were never truly repaid, and a chilling lesson for the Skynavian dogs."

Now, however, the madgriff's luck was up.\n\nTanks and infantry rolled through the dead streets of Bleakspire, the population fearfully hiding within their homes and the rebels hiding within their bastions. Word had spread of Kemerskai's purges, and more and more viewed him as a tyrant and an autocrat - he was feared, but he was certainly not loved either, that much was certain. No pomp and circumstance greeted Kemerskai's batallions this time, and some citizens even jeered at the soldiers of the Republic as they marched towards the city council, ready to put an end to Vinke's heresy.\n\nIt was a short battle. Vinke's forces shattered at the prescence of real military veterans, and the griffon himself was barely alive at the end of the ordeal, his body battered with bruises as he flung himself at each Republican "traitor". The unconscious griffon was treated and sent to Cloudbury, where he awaited the justice of the Gods and the President-Marshal.\n\nCornelius Vinke was defiant until the last, cursing the "false Republic" and its "Maarite crypto-monarchist leader" until he was finally brought up to the gallows, where his eyes grew wide at the site of his certain doom. Kemerskai and Sunglider were in the crowd, watching as the life of one of the Republic's greatest griffons was shattered in front of their eyes.\n\n"This is your fault, President," the ever-faithful Sunglider spat, meeting the President-Marshal with his one-eyed gaze, "His life was not yours to take. He penned countless works in favor of our Republic, helped gather support against the Duchy, built the foundations of our democracy, and yet you killed him all the same."\n\nKemerskai stared at him and sighed. "It was my duty. He was a traitor who rebelled against his President, and subverted his Republic."\n\n"Everything he did was for the Principles of the National Republican Party. The same cannot be said for you, my brother."\n\n And with that, Sunglider walked away, and Kemerskai was left alone, sheer fury in his eyes, in front of the lifeless corpse of Cornelius Vinke."

I lived thirty years of my life as a hero but all will remember me as a tyrant..."\n\nHe struggled to get the words out, gasping with pain and crying in shame.\n\n"All I did... I did for stability, for the Republic, for our future... You have to restore democracy, as I should have done... Do not die a tyrant as I have." Kemerskai squeezed his claw into his son's, tears on both of their faces, "Remember Alex. Liberty, democracy, prosperity."\n\n"I'm off to see Boreas... Oh, and Alex..." He said, looking to his son with fear.\n\n "Yes father? What is it..." Alexander stated, gripping his father's claws tightly.\n\n "Remember me for the good that I did, not the bad. Please..."\n\n "Of course I will, I love you dad..." Alexander told him, and Kemerskai simply smiled and closed his eyes, falling into a peaceful sleep.\n\n He was pronounced dead within the next few days, but by that point, he was only a figurehead - all his power had been transferred to his son.\n\n As Alex left the hospital with the power of the President-Marshal, Kemerskai Jr. had two choices - shall he restore democracy as his father advised him too?

As griffons debated, three choices had become frontrunners.\n\n"The Tricolour" is the party anthem of the NRP, and many claim that integrating it as our national anthem would increase party unity and show the people of Griffonia that we are still devoted to Republican causes. However, using the anthem of the NRP for the national anthem could be viewed as an attack by many small parties that have begun to form in parliament. Even without its political undertones, "The Tricolour" is still a divisive anthem - it's chorus, "Though cowards flinch and traitors sneer, we'll keep the tricolour flying here," has been viewed as offensive and crass. However, it still stands as one of the most popular unofficial anthems and is a staunch Republican tune.\n\nThe next song in consideration is "Risen From Ruins," a tune popularized during the Republican Revolution itself, that speaks of a united, free Griffonia. While "The Tricolour" speaks of Republicanism in general, "Risen From Ruins" speaks of our final goal. "Let us serve your good weal truly, Griffonia, our fatherland."\n\nThe last song for consideration is "Unity and Justice and Freedom", the third stanza of the popular Griffonian song "Das Lied der Griffonien", also called "Song of the Griffons". Our democratic values and our views for a united Griffonia are echoed in every word of this third stanza. In addition, picking a song that has already been popularized among the people of Griffonia may prove a boon to our legitimacy as the rightful successor to the dying Empire.\n\nIn the end however, which song shall be chosen?"

He is not befitting of such a high honour."\n\nUnfortunately, he was not soft enough, and Mach stood up from his chair, pointing at the Feathisian, "I would not tolerate this Frogeater in any National Republic. He is pompous, lazy, and inferior, all Herzlanders know that!"\n\n"The same to you, you disgusting peasant!" Hereen screeched at Mach, rising from his chair, "Suntail, this griffon is nothing but a fraud, acting for his own good.

In fact, Heeren is already leaving."\n\nThe Feathisian attempted to speak out a response, but Suntail's guards had already escorted him from the room when he found the words he wanted to say.\n\n"Do not take his departure personally, Mr. Mach.

Erion XII suffered the same fate, although by a mob of trade unionists, not at the claws of the National Republicans.\n\nWith most of the Archons dead and the new ones just as bad, Suntail announced a new plan - one that would completely curtail the political power of the Archonate. They would no longer have the ability to influence the public of Griffonia at all, with encyclicals coming upon strict censorship by Suntail's NRIF to make sure it was not peddling inaccurate information. Archons and prelates would not be allowed to hold political office, and many temples not in use would be demolished for recreation or for industrial purposes. \n\nAny Archon subject to treason against the Republic would be tried and replaced with another one, who would hopefully learn not to speak out against the President-Marshal, and the same would go for even the lowliest prelate.\n\nAlthough many have condemned this decree as being tyrannical, the true defenders of the National Republic recognize the necessary measures of control on the traitorous Archonate."

[Root.GetLeader] has spoken with his advisors about the greatest course of action to integrate the remnants of the old Empire, and almost every one has suggested leaving the Emperor as monarch of at least the Kingdom of the Heartlands, binding Cloudbury to the already popular Grover dynasty.\n\nWith that, the Dual Monarchy of Cloudbury and Herzland was formed, with Oskar I taking control over everything north of the Herzland and the Grovers ruling over the Herzland proper, in mostly the same fashion of their old regime. Grover VI's loyalty to the Dual Monarchy was clenched by a two-pronged offer - the Kingdom of the Heartlands would accept a marriage pact with the Cloudburians, and the dynasties would be eternally tied together.\n\nWith the issue of loyalty and hereditary customs dealt with, the Council for the Establishment of the Dual Monarchy, led by [Root.GetLeader] himself, then decided on the administrative priveleges of each monarchy and their legislatures. Both Cloudbury and Griffenheim would be capitals of the Dual Monarchy, and while Cloudbury would be the ceremonial, de-facto capital, Griffenheim would be the capital where most administrative duties were to be held, such as sittings of the joint parliament, although most legislative duties would be confined to the monarchies themselves, which have a staggering amount of autonomy in the Dual Monarchy as a nation.\n\nParliamentary elections for both the Herzland and Cloudbury parliaments were promised, although the level of democracy and the actual parties allowed in these parliaments would essentially be subject to the monarchies themselves - so the old Cloudburian and Herzlander systems were left largely intact. Of course, although received by many of the ruling class to be an excellent decision, the Dual Monarchy was criticized passionately in the newspapers and radios of the Republic. Republican commentators of the banned National Republican Party declared it a move towards true reactionary politics of the old Empire, while many constitutional monarchists spoke in hushed voices about the possible takeover by Cloudbury by the Imperial monarchy.

They have used the death as a rallying cry against the opposition, instead of declaring themselves the leader of the struggle against the leader they just rebelled against. Both Marshals have declared that the other was the cause for Kemerskai's death, and confrontations between supporters of the two have erupted.

 griffonRepublic.268.d:0 "Today, President Alexander Kemerskai Jr. announced the annulment of the 986 Act For The Salvation Of The Republic, created during the Skynavian crisis, when the Republic was truly thought to be in jeopardy. Positive reactions to the initial actions made by the Marshal, however, have faded, when the [GetYear] Protection Of The Republic Act was passed just after in parliament.\n\nThe new POTR act differs greatly from the original 986 Act, with the parliament, currently suspended on the 20-year old orders of Kemerskai Sr., completely abolished in favor of an advisory council to the President-Marshal directly. Elections, which had been allowed at the local level but postponed at the national level, were now out of the question for every single municipality and state in the Republic. Senators and Ministers of Parliament were booted out of their positions, and once-loyal advisors found themselves removed from the Republic entirely.\n\nSchnabel Sunglider, former Vice Marshal under the Kemerskai Sr. regime, found himself hung for treason after he was revealed to have participated in a plot against the Republican government. Sunglider had attempted to contact Heinrich Kingfeather to strike against the Kemerskai Jr. dictatorship, but was soon turned in by the ever-loyal lawyer himself. Sunglider went to the gallows quietly, and rested his head solemnly before being escorted to his certain death - but one could see the fury in his eyes. Fury at Kingfeather, fury at the autocracy of the modern Republic, as he would call it, and at the President-Marshal himself.\n\nAs democracy dies, so does its greatest servant - and the question remains whether Kemerskai Jr.'s government will ever return to the days of old, where democracy was at the forefront of every decision made by the Republic."
 griffonRepublic.268.a:0 "It was a necessary measure."

 griffonRepublic.269.t:0 "The Next Successor"
 griffonRepublic.269.d:0 "To ensure a safe and secure secession once the young marshal passes away, Kemerskai Jr. has officially determined that his son, Johannes Kemerskai, will serve as the next President-Marshal of the Republic, provided that "a situation warranting the restoration of democracy is never found". Johannes, only 12 years old, has already been placed in a highly prestigious military and political academy deserving of the heir to the Republic, and Kemerskai Jr. has authorized a full contingent of bodyguards to accompany the young griff at all times.\n\nMany in the Republic have seen this move as the ultimate betrayal of the Republic's democratic principles and described the system as hereditary and monarchical. Kemerskai Jr., however, has confronted critics by noting them of his father's own decision to make him the next President-Marshal of the Republic on his deathbed.\n\n"My political enemies, idealistic and blinded by hatred as they are, ignore the very reason we all are here today - that Kemerskai himself proposed my ascension as the next President-Marshal! No one took issue at THAT proposal, so I would hardly see that any rational and sane griffon would attack me for doing the same. Would you rather have it so if I was to die, that some incompetent civil servant or murderous general would take the stand? No! Well then, it is perfectly fine that I am educating my son in the ways of the Republic, so that he may become as great as his grandfather," Alexander commented on the issue."

 griffonRepublic.270.t:0 "The End Of An Era"
 griffonRepublic.270.d:0 "This morning, Alexander Jr. declared the end of political tutelage and the establishment of true constitutional government in the name of the Three Principles and the Republican Dream. Coupled with this new proclamation was his own resignation as President-Marshal, citing his undemocratic rise to power and inexperience politically, although many believe these points were simply covers to placate democrats and truly begin the electoral cycle.\n\nThe first candidate that has come forth is Stevano Arivelli, a Wingbardian businessgriff and protege of Heinrich Kingfeather of Republican fame, who decided not to run for elections due to an ongoing investigation of war crimes. Arivelli has already promised a new government based on free-market capitalism, small government, and pragmatic principles. Although many have criticized his campaign for being "a front for Kingfeather to secure the Presidency", none can doubt Arivell's personal commitment to the Republic.\n\nThe most radical of the candidates is Schnabel Sunglider, a major ally and critic of Kemerskai ever since the Republican Revolution. A Marshal of the Republic driven by the values of 978 and the Three Principles, Sunglider is a clear choice for the idealist citizen - but does the Republic really need such a militant democrat in this time of strife?\n\nThe third candidate is Walter Emerich. Like Sunglider, he is a general and idealist, but has positioned himself as the centrist candidate in this election. Emerich has stressed unity, security, and stability as goals of his candidacy, and his position in the Republican military has landed him an endorsement from Claus Rosewing himself.\n\nWho shall triumph in these first true elections?"

 griffonRepublic.271.t:0 "The Trial Of The Generals"
 griffonRepublic.271.d:0 "It was the young marshal himself who conducted the trials of the generals charged with war crimes in the Skynavian Campaign and purges against their own people in Cloudbury. It was an old belief that his father taught him - the griffon who kills another must have it in him to see the sentence passed. The evidence against Reinhard Suntail, Max Whitfeather, and Claus Rosewing was shocking but understandable - the Republic had been at war, both internationally and domestically, and the old marshal himself did not question his generals' actions. But this was not the age of Kemerskai - the son had succeeded the father, and the defense of "following orders" found itself less and less of an option.\n\nThe first to take the stand was Whitefeather, and the crimes levied against him were perhaps the most harsh. Accused of mudering thousands of Skynavian troops during the Sparrowsbane conflict and the war itself, evidence had shown that Whitefeather committed outright war crimes against the populace of Skynavia. While he defended his actions, saying that the brutal murders and sacks his brigades conducted were within unofficial wartime laws, the judges had already made their verdict. Guilty.\n\nThe next was Reinhard Suntail, who had also been brought up on old charges of warlordism and participating in terrorism, in addition to the current charges of crimes against the Skynavian people. With every piece of evidence being used to convict Suntail with complicity in the attempted bombing of Cloudbury in 1003, the war crimes in Skynavia were almost of little importance. Guilty.\n\nRosewing was the last, and was convicted mostly on his ties to monarchist groups. Numerous natives testified that Rosewing had given them bribes and offerings to join his warlord band for the restoration of monarchy in the Republic, and Otto Saxhagen-Plumenjar, an admiral and a member of the royal family, told the judges that Rosewing had sent him numerous messages asking him to be the new figurehead for the ducal restoration. Guilty."

 griffonRepublic.272.d:0 "President, Marshal, Hero. The amount of titles and honors that Alexander Kemerskai was carting around at the moment was one that he could silently admit to himself was ridiculous. Still, they were evidence of what he had achieved in life, and he did not deny the meaning behind them. It was just that right now he could have traded them all for even a modicum of greater confidence in himself. He walked up towards the large house, holding the bouquet of flowers in his claw, and silently muttered to himself the little speech he had been planning on and off for years.\n\nIf there was one thing he regretted about his long and storied career, it was that he had fallen into the trap that so many great people fell into; the one where you worked so hard to fulfill your duties that there was nothing left for yourself... or for your family. He found her in the garden, busying herself with picking dead leaves from the rose bushes, and whether she didn't notice him or just ignored him, she didn't look up from it as he came up to her.\n\n"How was your day?" she asked, Alexander finding himself trying to recall when it had become a mechanical response given out of habit. And yet why shoudln't it be? He glanced down at the bouquet, suddenly wanting to throw it away. It was such a pathetically inadequate way to beg forgiveness for having all but ignored her for so many years. Duty, revolution, greater good; all those excuses felt like ashes in his mouth. In the end, it was the fact that he didn't respond that made her look up and see the bouquet.\n\n"I..." Alexander began, realizing he had completely forgotten the speech he had prepared. He was left simply holding the bouquet out to her, stiffly. "I've let you down," he managed to blurt out. "I've been a bad husband for too long. I'm sorry, and I just hope I can make it up to you... if it's not too late?" he asked, half expecting to have the bouquet thrown back in his face.\n\nInstead, she burst into tears and embraced him, leaving him to return it and gently rock his wife back and forth, telling her how much he loved her as she cursed him out for having taken so long. President, Marshal, Hero; to Tartarus with all those titles. The title he cared about right now was Husband, no more and no less. "

Whatever the results he had produced had been, there was something implacable about the general who had been there from the start.\n\n"General Kemerskai," he addressed the griff, wondering what would come now. Kemerskai was a difficult figure to grasp. Was he the savior of the revolution, or was he simply one of many warlords who had emerged on top? \n\n"I read your letter, "Kemerskai responded, "And it is indeed a convenient solution, isn't it? I came here not because I was planning to resign, but because I want to tell you and make you understand this: That fateful day when we marched north from the Herzland, I could easily have crawled off and hide. In any of these last 30 years I could have scraped together wealth and fled abroad to live a life of luxury. In these last few years I could have capitulated to any of the forces that wanted to break us. I know you would prefer if I quietly stepped out of the limelight and gave you uncontested rule of the nation. I swore an oath though.\n\nI swore an oath to stand by the revolution. I will never give up the struggle, nor will I let down those who have died for it. I will never let the tears shed by those bereaved in this fight be for nothing, just like how I will never say goodbye to the soldiers who still stand in the ranks. We both know what is going on here, Mister President. We know this game, and we're going to play it because that's what we do. This is my move, however: you will have to drag me kicking and screaming from the Republic's High Command. Have I made myself clear, Mister President?"\n\n"You have, General," President Astler responded evenly. "Thank you for your commitment. That will be all, general."

He took walks nowadays, if only to the library, and  at several occasions he interacted with people on the streets. When he came home he went to his room and began reading though, and he did so for hours.\n\nThe books he had loaned had not escaped attention though: books on law, economics and especially a copy of the new constitution. The young griffon seemed fully in the throes of a zeal that saw him reading into the small hours and only sleep for brief periods of time. As Johanna came in with his dinner, Grover looked to her and thanked her, something that one would have made her over the moon but which now was standard. She couldn’t help but look over the books he had been reading, curious about what was going on.\n\n“What are you reading?” she asked Grover, who finished the bite of food in his mouth before wiping his beak and pointing into it.\n\n“That old crow said I could be anything now…” he told her, “And this thing here says “every citizen of the republic has the inalienable right to take part in its government".

I wish I could shed a tear, my brothers, but the truth is, Grover V has done nothing for the Heartlands but drive it into doom and despair. I'm sure many of you would agree that Grover V has done almost nothing right - he has let Katerin burn, strengthened the powers of the Archon, centralizing religious control over the capital and ending any hope of a secular Griffonia. He has spit in the face of every constitutional reform that he has been offered, even with the threat of a Second Griffonian Revolution on his doorstep.\n\nHe has let loose the Eastern marches to continue their genocidal crusades on the ponies, and lost the Duchy of Griffonstone to a weak Regency Council under a griffon so old he is called "Grandpa"! He didn't even die right! He left the Empire in such chaos I'm almost inclined to cheer at his death. His son is not even six years old, and it is likely that a regency council of nobles, oligarchic and corrupt, will rule in his stead.\n\nAs much as it pains to say it, this is a victory for the Republic.

He has sat comfortably in Skyfall for many years, profiteering from the chaotic state of Griffonia. And yet! Skyfall amazes again!

It sought to cast down tyrannical kings, and let all drink from the goblet of freedom. This Wingbardian movement stands in stark contrast to us, being more concerned with parading their king around as a figurehead while their military crush all who would dare to speak out against them.\n\nMy fellow republicans.

The nobility spent lavishly and began to gain more and more wealth and power while the people suffered, and the army began to mistrust the Emperor, especially a clique led by Kemerskai, Suntail, and Rosewing, among many other officers. One fateful day in February 978, peasants and workers seized the streets of Griffenheim, battling with guardsgriffs and storming houses and prisons. Every prisoner in the Imperial Cells was let out, and the people soon began to march upon the Imperial Palace. Kemerskai and many other imperial officers who had participated in an army-wide mutiny, along with hundreds and hundreds of commoners, stood at the gates of the seat of Imperial power and their government. In pure decentralized chaos, a wave of commoners rushed through the palace, trampling antique carpets, throwing artifacts to the ground and breaking the stained-glass windows of the Archonate.\n\n However, none of the commoners could find Grover V, despite Kemerskai's best efforts to look for him. According to Republican reports, he was whisked away by Eros at the last minute. However, the commoners and military did find the entire regency council, save for Eros and the emperor, of course. Some were put on a mock trial which always resulted in their executions, others were simply brutally mauled in the streets, others attempted to fight their way through the commoners. The regency council lost their power in the capital, and their deaths were cheered by thousands of griffons in the crowds.

The victory was decisive, and Count Jonas's forces were beaten back to the North, where after further confrontation with Republican forces, eventually fled into Bronzehill and left fighting entirely.

This new state, the Peasant's Republic of Interriver, was almost socialist in nature, distributing wealth and power among the people and organizing themselves into communes.

Kemerskai, however, utilized defensive tactics and artillery barrages, which he became famous for, and eviscerated his father's forces while on the defense. Thousands of griffons died in the attack on Kemerskai's fallback line, and when Kemerskai's forces counterattacked, the Baron's numerically superior force was driven back into the city itself.\n\nAldus's forces surrendered, and he was taken prisoner by his son. Along with his foremost officers (troops were given the option to join the Republic, those that refused were simply killed), he was taken to the city square of Vinnin, where he had once announced the Emperor's decrees and executions of his own. Now, the tides had turned, and Aldus was sentenced to death for the charges of treason against the people and peasants of Griffonia. The Baron of Vinnin, betrayed by his own son, was enraged, and seethed at Kemerskai for his last words, before he was executed by his child's headsman.\n\nThe Republic was now in control of all of Interriver, and with Suntail and Rosewing's campaigns in the East, South, and North succeeding, it seemed as if the Republic was about to secure the entire Griffenheim area in its own right, with many forces already moving into Katerin and Angriver in the South, where Republican support was high."

 griffonRepublic_history.6.t:0 "Springtime in Griffonia"
 griffonRepublic_history.6.d:0 "After securing the Imperial heartland of Griffenheim, Alexander Kemerskai, regarded by many as the leader of the revolution, with his leadership of the National Republican Party and successful campaigns in Interriver, called for the first ever presidential election the history of the Griffonian Empire. The elections were dominated by the National Republican Party, led by Kemerskai, but there were many others, such as the Socialist People's Party, led by the young and idealistic revolutionary Asper Sickleclaw, which advocated for socialism and revolutionary practice and ideology. Elections were also contested by revolutionary right-wing organizations, such as the National Revolutionary Front, led by the now-dead Peter Alstrenner, which advocated for staunch anti-monarchism, fanatic nationalism and pan-griffonian identity, along with a corporatist economic system.\n\nTo no-one's suprise, Kemerskai won with 77% of the vote, with Sickleclaw and Alstrenner both receiving under 15% of the vote. The NRP's unitary rhetoric, democratic principles, and the fact that the revolution was still ongoing and the people wanted stability, gave them an easy ride to victory. Kemerkai's experience as a war hero made him a very popular candidate, and his cabinet was generally built on compromise between moderate factions. It included army generals, idealists, pragmatists, all united under democratic cause and purpose. At least, in theory.\n\nKemerskai's first 100 days were surprisingly stable, as the Griffonian counter-revolutionaries still were licking their wounds in Bronzehill and Strawberry and did not undergo major attacks against the Republic during that time. To appease the workers, peasants, and other disaffected citizens, Kemerskai immeadiately began to implement large-scale reforms. The first act of his government was to remove any lingering positions of slavery, serfdom, and servitude in the Empire, freeing all who would fall under those positions, even when many of those tactics were not practiced any more by the Empire. Kemerskai improved welfare reforms for common griffons, establishing industrial changes such as minimum wage laws and steep taxation of Griffonian nobles and oligarchs to redistribute wealth to the common griffon. His policies were massively popular, and Kemerskai's approval ratings soared. However, Kemerskai's government did find trouble with inflation, with his economists often focused more on welfare policies than balancing the budget, leading to the printing of massive amounts of idols to satisfy Kemerskai's lofty ambitions\n\nFor now, at least, Griffonia was free."

 griffonRepublic_history.7.d:0 "Unfortunately for the Republic, the Griffonian nobility in exile did not simply let the Republicans take over their nation. With the aid of Grover V's faithful guardian and religious mentor, Archon Eros VII, launched a counter-revolution. Aided by the Count of Bronzehill, whose subjects were surprisingly loyal to the monarchy, and the Duchess of Strawberry, the counterrevolutionaries gained a foothold in the North. Coming from Bronzehill and Strawberry, Imperial forces overwhelmed Republican forces in Interriver, putting an end to the socialist Republicans who had taken root there and restoring the Barony of Vinnin under Kemerskai's brother, August Kemerskai I. Asper Sickleclaw escaped with his life, and continued to support Kemerskai's National Republican Party, although many ultranationalists had abandoned Kemerskai during the collapse of the Republic.\n\nWith Diamond Dogs, Archon Eros VII, and associated Imperial, Feathisian, and Eagleclaw forces marching against the President-Marshal, Alexander Kemerskai ordered a full retreat from Griffenheim, desiring a tactical retreat into the north and eventual takeover of the weak Duchy of Cloudbury, sending letters to all generals in the army. The armies that participated in this Long March included Kemerskai's own army currently in Interriver, the army of Claus Rosewing and Max Whitefeather currently fighting in Katerin and Angriver, and Reinhard Suntail's army also in the North. There were many more units that attempted to participate, but they were rooted out by roving Imperial armies and annihilated. Many Republican armies stayed in Angriver and hid in the great Scheißwald, commencing small raids on associated Angriverian forest towns. Others went to Katerin, including knight brigades that had sided with the Republicans, which produced an odd combination of pious knights and republican revolutionaries."

Luca's plan was critical to easily defeating the Duchy of Cloudbury and relieving rebel forces led by Georg Teafeather in the Whitetail Mountains. However, Luca was caught off guard by the forces of the Count of Bronzehill, led by now-famous general Shep Ironhall. His army was flanked by multiple diamond dog divisions and obliterated, ending all plans of a two-front war against the Duchy. Luca's body was later found along with Teafeather's, whose own daughter eventually took up his cause.\n\nWhile Luster's armies were failing in the North, an obscure republican officer by the name of Blackrock defected from the Republican cause, her troop becoming an independent, roving bandit army. Blackrock's task to take Griffonstone for the Republican revolution morphed into a desire to take Griffonstone for her new bandit fiefdom. Kemerskai's letter to flee to Cloudbury was reported to have been burned by Blackrock as she marched further south. There would be no Long March North from her troop.\n\nHowever, not all was lost. Kemerskai's army quickly joined up with the forces of Reinhard Suntail and Claus Rosewing near the Feathisian border, and prepared to retreat North to the Duchy of Cloudbury. While their army moved North, they were caught by a large force which included troops from the Strawberry Duchy and troops loyal to the Grand Duke of Feathisia. With the combined might of three, albeit weakened, armies, Kemerskai, Suntail, and Rosewing drove back the opposition with moderate losses. The Battle of Mirabelle was won, and the three armies moved across the Feathisian border into Cloudbury."

 griffonRepublic_history.9.d:0 "When the Republicans marched through the Feathisian-Cloudburian border from the south, they arrived at the city of Kloborg, one of the only cities in Cloudbury governed by a non-hereditary ruler. Due to Republican tensions in the city, in 965 ALB, the Duke of Cloudbury, Otto II, abolished the Barony of Kloborg and allowed noble Karl Svens-Rinner to become the first Mayor of Kloborg. While Otto II believed this would quell Republican tension, it did not, and Kloborg openly declared for Kemerskai's rebellion, giving his troops arms, supplies, food, and rest. Karl Svens-Rinner and his protege Tobias Sivenhof, who would later become a prominent Republican minister, became the leaders of the pro-Republican movement in Cloudbury, and would inspire numerous peasant revolts and attacks across the country after their declaration for Kemerskai.\n\nDespite Republican belief that the Cloudburians would fall easily, the war in the North raged on, and in the winter of 979, the Republicans were forced to hold the southern provinces of Cloudbury, which included most of the province of Winghagen (except the city itself, which was engaged in a brutal siege by Republican forces). The Cloudburian navy was still stationed in the Winghagen city-port, and would gather resources for the sieged city by buying goods from Vedina and the Imperials. The Imperial army, interestingly enough, had not attacked the Republicans from the South, focusing more on quelling internal resistance and saving what little territory they had left after the numerous independence declarations by Imperial vassals. It seemed the Republicans were in for a long war, with the siege of Winghagen ongoing and Cloudbury only a dream of spring.\n\nWhile the Republicans believed they could not take Winghagen, the tide soon changed in their advantage, when the arrival of a small flotilla under Hermann and Cornelius Hassentelf, Republican naval officers from a small Feathisian noble family turned the tide of the siege. The Hassentelf brothers crushed the Cloudburian fleet, which was completely unaware of any major Republican naval presence. With the Cloudburian fleet destroyed, Winghagen quickly surrendered to the Republicans. Count Leonhard Gørtz himself brought the letter of surrender to General Claus Rosewing, but this did not save him. For his actions against the Griffonian Republic and the revolution, he was hanged as a traitor just hours after his surrender."

 griffonRepublic_history.10.d:0 "In the coming months, the Republicans made small gains, but could never take the grand prize of Cloudbury. The city was nearly encircled more than twice by Suntail and Rosewing's combined armies, but Otto's troop size was much more vast than the Republicans, so they were able to repel any chances of a tactical encirclement through sheer numbers. With the west and east mostly controlled by the Republicans, the major factor that would lead to the capitulation of the Duchy was Cloudbury, and while County and Barony fell around him, Otto II barricaded himself and his armies inside the heartland of the Duchy.\n\nHowever, while Otto II could save his city from the Republicans, he could not save his city from its own denizens. Under the cover of night, Republican agents and thousands of Cloudburian workers and peasants stormed the Cloudbury Palace in a brutal rendition of the events of 978. Otto II was kept alive on the orders of the Republicans, who proceeded to hang him for treason against the Griffonian Republic. Urged on by the Republican military, who had been starved for vengeance ever since they were driven from Griffenheim, the mob of Cloudburian workers and Republican soldiers lynched an endless sum of aristocrats and nobles in what became known as the "Sack Of Cloudbury". Otto II's son and heir, Karl, along with his brother, Kristoffer, were killed by the Republicans, as were most of the Plumenjar dynasty's closest members.\n\n Oskar Plumenjar, Otto's uncle, pleaded for mercy in front of Kemerskai, and he, along with his daughter and wife, were spared the terror of the gallows. While Kemerskai's mercy was used as a propaganda tool, Oskar was exiled to a small village in the Northern Tribes, right above the Cloudburian border, to make sure the Plumenjars would never threaten Cloudbury and the Republic again."

 griffonRepublic_history.11.d:0 ""This traitorous counter-revolution is undoubtedly more dangerous than Eros VII, Eagleclaw and Georgie Bronzetail put together, because ours is a country where the ruling class is in a minority, where peasant and native property has gone to ruin and where, in addition, the demobilisation has set loose vast numbers of potentially mutinous elements." - Alexander Kemerskai, on the Skynavian Revolution.\n\nThe 986 Election was set to be a slim majority for Alexander Kemerskai's National Republican Party, but even so, many in the Republic had doubts over whether the results would truly lead to a victory for Kemerskai. Asper Sickleclaw, socialist militant and revolutionary, had capitalized on rising dissent against the "Old Marshal", and his coalition with the Native's Rights Party meant that the Socialist People's Party might finally pose a threat to Kemerskai's government on a national level. With the newspapers predicting a slim chance of a Sickleclaw victory, Kemerskai made a choice that would change the Republic forever.\n\nThe National Republican controlled legislature passed with a 2/3 majority the "986 Act For The Salvation Of The Republic", which would drastically strengthen the powers of the executive and suspend parliamentary and persidential elections until "national security is in a favorable position to allow the system of democracy to flourish once more." Any hope of a Sickleclaw presidency was destroyed, and Kemerskai's NRP once again became the sole political force in the Republic.\n\nThe socialists, traitors as they were, did not take the Act For The Salvation Of The Republic lightly. Sickleclaw formed the United Socailist Revolutionary Front and fled north in a Second Long March, with the war-torn armies of the Republic powerless to stop him. The Socialist Republic of Skynavia was formed, and the Revolution of 986 was forever burned into the history and politics of the fledgeling Republic."

 griffonRepublic_history.12.d:0 "While the Republic had recovered mostly from the Revolution of 986 and the Skynavian Betrayal, many in the government were still not happy with the policies of the Kemerskai regime, especially Claus Rosewing, Kemerskai's faithful Chief Of Staff and Vice President, before the posts were separated after his dismissal.\n\nRosewing, disillusioned with Kemerskai's autocratic measures and failure to enact the promised principles of the Griffonian Revolution, began to spar with the President-Marshal over increasingly trivial matters. When Rosewing suggested that a constitutional monarchy would be better than the current Kemerskai regime, the President-Marshal, furious, removed him from his posts for the simple crime of "Insubordination". His position as Vice President was given to Schnabel Sunglider, another politician skeptical of Kemerskai's growing authoritarianism, to rekindle the bonds between the Old Guard of the National Republican Party and its right-wing elements. His controversial successor as Chief Of Staff was Reinhard Suntail, who at this point was undergoing an investigation from the media and the government for alledged ties to ultranationalist groups. In another effort to unify the Republic's political factors, Kemerskai appointed a griffon who by all means should have not been leading the military, event if he was a capable marshal.\n\nRosewing was sent North by Kemerskai to "keep the peace", but this would prove to be a fatal mistake. Rosewing, angered by the actions of the government he had sworn to support, began actions of petty banditry and warlordism, rallying native and monarchist forces in an underground coalition. Although Rosewing did not engage in the levels of banditry that Suntail inevitably did, his actions helped hasten the Republic's descent into chaos, banditry, and warlordism, factors that effect the Republic even today."

While Suntail was never found truly guilty, plans leaked by a GNRF informant detailed plans to create a false-flag terrorist attack in Cloudbury, blame it on communists and the Centre-NRP, and use it to sponsor a GNRF takeover of the government. Names listed in the report included Reinhard Suntail himself.\n\nKemerskai, without enough evidence to fully convict Reinhard Suntail of being complicit in the planned attack, as he denied every charge alleged by the government and the conspirators, instead exiled him North with Rosewing, and stripped him of all government titles. Suntail's position of Chief of Staff was given to Schnabel Sunglider, who Kemerskai viewed as a dangerous Vice President. Sunglider's former position as Vice President was given to Heinrich Kingfeather, a pragmatist and close ally of Kemerskai since the Republican Revolution. Suntail and Rosewing were out of government, and relative unity was restored among the top officials of the Republic - although Suntail took the exile North even harder than Rosewing did.\n\n"

Rikard Astler's new "Left-NRP", as it was called, soon won seats in multiple city councils across the Republic - from Squark to Winghagen, new socialist ideas were making their mark in the unions and workplaces of the Republic.\n\nAstler himself, however, could not settle for a mere position on the city council - in 1005, he sought the position of Mayor of Cloudbury itself, one of the only elected offices not to have their elections suspended by Kemerskai in 986. The sitting mayor, Nicholas Egscher, slandered Astler, calling him a godless communist, a Skynavian puppet, and a foolish idealist - Egscher himself was a member of Sunglider's faction of the Republic, and had promoted many of the same values Astler also supported, but in the end, his militant anti-socialism was his undoing. Astler, bolstered by the welfare reforms that had come to Cloudbury in the last few months, won the election in a staggering upset, unseating Egscher for the first time in over two decades.\n\nSoon after, Astler was appointed as one of Kemerskai's councillors, and the influence of the Left-NRP grew more and more in the Republic - and their influence is not the only thing that has grown. So has Astler's ambition."

Rosewing's doubts about the Republican ideal manifested into full hatred, and he eventually abandoned the ideals of harmony altogether, idolizing military dictatorships and bandit states. Rosewing, however, never stooped to the level of Suntail's raiders, and always distributed raided wealth among his troops. He preferred to raid armouries, and warned his soldiers against attacking towns, pronouncing the death penalty for any Republican officer who would do such a thing. Rosewing's style of banditry became popular among his soldiers, but whenever he looted the lands he once fought for, he turned sour, and he always thought back to the times he spent with Kemerskai."

 FAT_political_pragmatist_desc:0 "If you asked a Republican citizen what Heinrich Kingfeather, arguably the second most powerful griffon in the Republic, has done in the last 4 years, despite his vast agenda, they would be unable to tell you anything.\n\nHeinrich Kingfeather was born in 949 ALB in Greengate, Yale. Trained in law and economics, the young Kingfeather did not seem like a suitable candidate for a revolutionary leader at all, but his progressive legal precedents led him to become one of Republicanism's staunchest defenders. When the Revolution broke out in 978, Kingfeather was originally skeptical, but eventually joined Kemerskai once Griffenheim had been seized and the regency council driven out. As a lawyer and politician first and revolutionary second, Kingfeather advocated for Republicanism at the international level, attempting numerous deals with both Equestria and the River Coalition - both who largely denied his advances. His legal and political action during Kemerskai's term eased public instability and anger at the Republicans, but it could not save the revolution militarily.\n\nKingfeather, instead of participating in the Long March, fled to Skyfall and then the newly independent City of Fezera, before finally arriving in the Republic to cheering crowds after its control over Cloudbury was secured. Although his inability to support the Republicans in the Long March was a point of disapproval for many, Kingfeather continued to represent the people of the Republic in their new seat in Cloudbury.\n\nKingfeather's work has largely been behind the scenes since he became Kemerskai's second-in-command in 1003, replacing ambitious militarist Schnabel Sunglider with a focus on largely domestic issues. Faced with an unruly military and banditry in the countryside, Kingfeather began to construct a policy that countered Sunglider's beliefs of violent reaction to dissidence. Kingfeather met with hundreds of native leaders in acts that helped mend the complete chaos in the countryside following Rosewing's initial agitation, acts that led him to become one of the most pro-native leaders on the national level. Pragmatism was Kingfeather's main goal, a goal that became more and more difficult with the polarization of the country between political and ethnic lines.\n\nWill he ever succeed? Or will he die with all the cards in his claws and no bravery to use them, as his opposition claims?"

While in the military, he joined the brigade of Artillerieoffizier Alexander Kemerskai, and he learned about harmony and republicanism. Immediately, he was drawn to the ideology, and began to delve into books about Equestria and Sicameon. Sunglider participated in the revolution, and served with honor and distinction in the National Republican Army. When he came to the north, he became active in politics, demanding a return to Griffenheim and the restoration of the supsended constiution. He became senator of Cloudbury, and then founded his own faction in the NRP - the Harmonist Caucus. With an almost fanatical devotion to the republic and harmony, Sunglider is an idealist and a militarist, things that make him one of the most dangerous griffons in Cloudbury."

### Leader Descriptions ###

chadskai_desc:0 "Alexander Kemerskai was born in Vinnin, the third son of Baron Aldus Kemerskai. With too late a place in succession and too insignificant a griffon to truly become one of the nobility, Kemerskai tried many odd jobs - he played cornet in the Vinnin Orchestra and was a constant guest at every event in town - eventually, however, he joined the Imperial military. He rose to the ranks of Artillerieoffizier in the Imperial Army, and was set to have a promising career in the armed forces as a Marshal. But fate had different ideas for Griffonia.\n\nThe tumultuous years that preceded 978 have disillusioned Kemerskai of his loyalty to the Emperor. He could not stand seeing the decadent nobility leech of others' hard work, nor did he approve of the awful conditions the commonfolk were subjected towards. Thus, he began plotting with like-minded officers and made use of the brewing peasants' insurrection. After a particularly crass display of authority abuse from the Regency Council, the people had enough and stormed the Imperial Palace. In the confusion that followed, Kemerskai found his way as the leader of the newly proclaimed Griffonian Republic.\n\nBut this success was not meant to last. Although Kemerskai was popular and commanded respect, he could not control everygriff, and ruling the already weakened country became impossible. It did not take long for a reactionary movement to rise up and banish the republican supporters from the Heartlands. The long march began towards the northern reaches of the fractured Empire, where they have taken control of the region from nobles attempting to start their own independent nation.\n\nMany years have passed since those events, and yet Marshal Kemerskai's devotion to the republican cause has not wavered. Although even now he has to deal with unruly subordinates, he still holds all the cards in his claws. He is also a prolific author, and his many writings inspire republican movements across the entire Griffonia to follow his cause."
suntail_desc:0 "Reinhard Suntail was born in Crona, a province in the heart of the Griffonian Empire. His family was poor, and lived on scraps. Suntail, wanting to escape the dreary farmlands of Crona, joined the Imperial Army at the age of 15, and journeyed to the city of Griffenheim, where he was placed into the brigade of Alexander Kemerskai, a renowned Artillerieoffizier in the Griffonian Empire and one of Grover's most promising generals.\n\nSuntail joined Kemerskai's plot to overthrow the empire, believing the monarchy of Griffonia was decadent, oligarchic, and drew upon the worst conditions of Griffonkind - greed and lust for power. Suntail participated in the battle for the Imperial Palace, and eventually found his way in command of an entire Republican batallion. With it, he went to his old hometown of Crona and engaged in a brutal looting campaign in an event which would be recalled as "The Rape of Crona" years later.\n\nWhen the revolutionaries began the long march north, Suntail began to doubt the harmonist values that Kemerskai was so dedicated to, and joined a new party - The Griffonian National Revolutionary Front, an ultranationalist organization dedicated to populism, republicanism, and fanatic devotion to the nation state and people. While Kemerskai did not trust Suntail, he was forced to make him the second most powerful griffon in the republic, and he became Kemerskai's top general.\n\nWhen the National Revolutionary Front was banned after a terrorist attack in Cloudbury in 1003, Suntail sent his army North, and began to loot, plunder, and sack both Republican and foreign strongholds for weapons and loot. He became a vicious bandit warlord, known for his sheer brutality against both harmonist and monarchist insitutions."
rosewing_desc:0 "Claus Rosewing, once Kemerskai's most trusted friend in the battle against reaction, was born in 941 in the city of Griffing, Angriver.\n\n At the age of 24, he joined the Imperial Army, and soon became a mentor and comrade to Kemerskai when he joined the army soon after. They both were staunch supporters of Grover IV and his new reforms - but they also believed in radical republicanism and democracy. Rosewing, ever the pragmatist, believed that a regime like Grover IV's would make revolution unnecessary - and that the people should only revolt when monarchy becomes oppressive and decadent. When Grover V took power, however, Rosewing became a supporter of revolution, participating in the mutiny of the Imperial Army during the March on the Imperial Palace. Rosewing participated in campaigns in Angriver and Katerin, and was appointed in late 978 as Kemerskai's official vice president.\n\nRosewing eventually fled north with Kemerskai, but by that point, the two had suffered many disagreements about Republican rhetoric and ideals. In 995, Rosewing was soon removed as Chief of Staff and Vice President - for Vice President, Kemerskai appointed Schnabel Sunglider, a staunch Republican, and for Minister of Defense, Reinhard Suntail, an openly far-right but skilled general.\n\nRosewing was sent North to keep the peace with a sizable force, but instead of keeping the peace, Rosewing began to undermine it. His warlord band soon built connections with native and monarchist groups, and Rosewing engaged in the looting of Republican armies and stockpiles. However, Rosewing was not fully anti-government, and always made sure never to attack towns - any soldier who did so would receive the death penalty. And there, in the north, Rosewing has stayed, "defending the peace" for 10 years and counting."
oskar_desc:0 "Oskar Plumenjar was never supposed to be duke of Cloudbury. Oskar was born to the brother of Crown Prince Otto (who would later rule the Duchy), August Plumenjar, in 956 ALB. When Kemerskai's revolution was brought north, and his uncle, Otto II was executed by Kemerskai, the rest of the legitimate Plumenjar line was taken captive and eventually killed.\n\nWhile this prevented a takeover from monarchist forces, there were still Plumenjars who were alive. The death of August in 975, just before the revolution, pressured Oskar to parley with the Republican government in order to save his own family and line. Oskar's sister, Oskar, and his son, Otto, all were spared by the Republican government - as a tool of propaganda or as a genuine act of mercy nobody is truly certain. While the Republicans allowed Oskar's sister and her son to stay in the Republic, Oskar himself was exiled to the Northern Tribes,\n\nIn the tranquil tribes, he has become a quiet, well-mannered griffon, who was until now not interested in pursuing his claim. Oskar preferred to live a peaceful life in the Northern Tribes, developing friendships with the local ponies there and becoming officially bilingual.\n\nJust now, however, Oskar was restored to the throne by warlord Claus Rosewing, who declared him Oskar I of the Duchy of Cloudbury. The line of Plumenjar would continue, and Cloudbury would once again stand under monarchic rule!"
hafslund_desc:0 "Jonas Hafslund was born in the Duchy of Cloudbury in 973 ALB, but when the Republicans moved North to secure the Duchy, his parents turned coat, cheering the Republican army as they marched through the hills of Bleakspire. Hafslund followed suit, and when at the age of 18, he immeadiately enlisted in the Republican army - like many new recruits, he was attracted by the passionate speeches of the President-Marshal but also by new, young radicals such as Rikard Astler. Hafslund found himself supporting socialist ideals, and participated in many social-democratic and democratic socialist organizations while an officer.\n\nIn 998 ALB, at 25, Hafslund was elevated in rank yet again at the request of many councilors who believed him to be loyal to the Republican cause should large-scale disobedience occur. Hafslund, along with the young strategist Otto Gremmersen, became one of the key griffons of the Young Officer's Movement, loyal to social-democratic policy and revolutionary ideas - in sharp contrast to the old guard who had once been entrenched in the Griffonian army.\n\n While Hafslund is still a relatively mediocre general, he has certainly become one of the harbingers of a new movement in the Republic - which has put him at odds with many of his fellow generals..."
emerich_desc:0 "Walter Emerich was born to a family of merchants in Winterbell, Strawberry, and was expected to join the family business at the Griffing river. Emerich, however, had different plans for his destiny, and when he turned 16, he bid his parents farewell and took a steamboat down the Griffing to Griffenheim.\n\nCity life, however, was not what Emerich believed it to be - and he soon wished to be back in Strawberry. Disillusioned with the poverty and strife in the capital following the death of the popular Grover IV, Emerich became active in underground republican circles.\n\nWhen revolution broke out in 978, Emerich rejoiced, and participated in the storming of the Imperial palace along with thousands of commoners. Despite not having a shred of military experience, he was appointed as an officer by the President-Marshal for his actions in the storming of the palace, but most historians attest Kemerskai appointed him to ensure support among fanatic republicans - who still viewed him as an opportunist.\n\nEmerich learned quickly from his fellow officers, participating in the First and Second Interriver Campaigns - but was defeated at the Second Battle of Vinnin by Erich Ebonwing.\n\nEmerich would subsequently participate in the Long March and post-revolutionary politics, being appointed provisional senator of Brenna by Kemerskai, a position he holds to this day - although now he stands as a military governor, fanatically loyal to the Marshal who gave him a new life."
rosewing_general_desc:0 "Claus Rosewing, once Kemerskai's most trusted friend in the battle against reaction, was born in 941 in the city of Griffing, Angriver.\n\n At the age of 24, he joined the Imperial Army, and soon became a mentor and comrade to Kemerskai when he joined the army soon after. They both were staunch supporters of Grover IV and his new reforms - but they also believed in radical republicanism and democracy. Rosewing, ever the pragmatist, believed that a regime like Grover IV's would make revolution unncessary - and that the people should only revolt when monarchy becomes oppressive and decadent. When Grover V took power, however, Rosewing became a supporter of revolution, participating in the mutiny of the Imperial Army during the March on the Imperial Palace. Rosewing participated in campaigns in Angriver and Katerin, and was appointed in late 978 as Kemerskai's official vice president.\n\nRosewing eventually fled north with Kemerskai, but by that point, the two had suffered many disagreements about Republican rhetoric and ideals. In 995, Rosewing was soon removed as Chief of Staff and Vice President - for Vice President, Kemerskai appointed Schnabel Sunglider, a staunch Republican, and for Minister of Defense, Reinhard Suntail, an openly far-right but skilled general.\n\nRosewing was sent North to keep the peace with a sizable force, but instead of keeping the peace, Rosewing began to undermine it. His warlord band soon built connections with native and monarchist groups, and Rosewing engaged in the looting of Republican armies and stockpiles. However, Rosewing was not fully anti-government, and always made sure never to attack towns - any soldier who did so would recieve the death penalty. And there, in the north, Rosewing has stayed, "defending the peace" for 10 years and counting."
schnabel_desc:0 "Schnabel Sunglider did not lose his eye in the service of his glorious Republic so that he could see it fall to limp-wristed conservatives, Skynavian-sympathizing democratic socialists, and vicious warlords. Vice-President of the Republic from 995 to 1003, and Chief of Staff from 1003 onwards, Schnabel Sunglider has been one of the staunchest supporters of the regime of Alexander Kemerskai and the democratic values that were promised by the revolution of 978.\n\nEver the idealist, Sunglider has fought for the rights of the people since he joined the National Republican Party in 975 ALB, becoming an unofficial leader of the party during his teenage years. From there, he rose to power in the revolution of 978 ALB, shaking claws with Marshal Kemerskai and together proclaiming the Griffonian Republic, along with generals Claus Rosewing and Reinhard Suntail. Sunglider fought with Reinhard Suntail in the Crona campaign, but took a bullet to the eye during the fighting. Whisked away by medics, Sunglider miraculously survived, but found Crona in ruins - Reinhard Suntail had sacked the city to the ground in vengeance for Imperial crimes and the percieved death of Sunglider.\n\nAlthough he never fully recovered from the loss of his eye, Sunglider kept fighting, and dissatisfied with Suntail, Sunglider fought with Kemerskai during his campaigns in the North with a fury that two-eyed griffons could barely match. A one-eyed phantom, Sunglider remained a battle-hardened tactician and fearsome general throughout his service in the Republican military.\n\nNow, Sunglider is in a prime position of power, and is ready to protect the Republican dream at any cost."

As such, we need to get ourselves a few. If we would use some of our "less-than-legal" connections, we might be able to get our claws on one or two of these. By inspecting them, we can learn much about the construction and technology behind them and, eventually, draw up our own Submarine models."
 FAT_new_airforce:0 "New Republican Air Forces"
 FAT_new_airforce_desc:0 "Only a few of the most powerful countries on the Griffonian continent have Air Forces, and we should do our best to join them in that. Having an efficient, large Air Force to contest the skies and aid our advance down below would greatly aid our war effort."
 FAT_fighter_focus:0 "Rule the Skies"
 FAT_fighter_focus_desc:0 "The most important part of air warfare is to have control over the skies, and as such, we should focus our efforts on creating planes that would let us do that. Our planes should be relatively small and agile, while remaining a deadly threat."
 FAT_bomber_focus:0 "Death From Above"
 FAT_bomber_focus_desc:0 "The biggest premise of this new air warfare is destroying as much of the enemy industry and infrastructure as we want. We should focus on creating planes that can carry as many bombs as possible, while allowing them to strike deep into enemy territory."
 FAT_air_doctrine:0 "Seek Foreign Expertise"
 FAT_air_doctrine_desc:0 "Seeing as how we lack our own professional pilots, we should focus our attention on establishing contacts with veterans from other nations. If we were to give enough of our funds to such pilots, they probably would be very excited and eager to work with us, and we could make them share their experience about air tactics and strategy."
 FAT_new_bombers:0 "Acquire New Bomber Blueprints"
 FAT_new_bombers_desc:0 "Foreign Pilots that have come to us from other countries sometimes brought something additional other than knowledge with them. If we were to splice everything together, we might be able to recreate working blueprints."
 FAT_new_fighters:0 "Commission New Fighters"
 FAT_new_fighters_desc:0 "Our new Pilots have asked us to commission a new set of Fighters. After a few talks and backroom deals, the pilots have helped our scientists develop new Fighter models for themselves to use."
 FAT_grand_1:0 "Ready For Everything"
 FAT_grand_1_desc:0 "We need to plan every attack, every defense, every retreat, and every advance. We need to change our army into something reminiscent of a clockwork, where every action is well-timed and well-planned."
 FAT_grand_2:0 "Fortify Our Positions"
 FAT_grand_2_desc:0 "To make sure our units are able to follow our meticulous orders, we need to make sure they will keep their positions. As such, we should focus on adding specialised units whose main task is to fortify areas that our troops are currently occupying."
 FAT_grand_3:0 "Reshuffle Our HQ"
 FAT_grand_3_desc:0 "Our recent changes in our army have, as of now, mostly taken care of our top commanders and our units, but we haven't done anything about most of our HQ, or about less important generals. Today, this will change, as we will make sure every one of them will follow our doctrine of extensive planning."
 FAT_grand_4:0 "Perfect Organization"
 FAT_grand_4_desc:0 "Through careful reform, our Army has been remade into a perfectly organised, well-lead Troop. We can truly be proud of this."
 FAT_superior_1:0 "A Wall of Bullets"
 FAT_superior_1_desc:0 "Why waste the lives of our citizens and our commanders' ability to think independently if we could just throw hundreds, if not thousands of artillery shells at the enemy?"
 FAT_superior_2:0 "Bring Order Into Our Army"
 FAT_superior_2_desc:0 "Our army isn't the most disciplined bunch. This has become increasingly worrying to our commanders, who now run the risk of bombarding our own troopers during artillery barrages, simply because said troopers wanted to gain glory for themselves. We must install a proper sense of order and discipline in these soldiers!"
 FAT_superior_3:0 "Dedicated Artilery Units"
 FAT_superior_3_desc:0 "With dedicated Artillery Regiments, we can more effectively coordinate Artillery bombardments with troop movements, resulting in even less friendly fire and more accurate barrages."
 FAT_superior_4:0 "Creeping Barrages"
 FAT_superior_4_desc:0 "With our amassed guns, we now have the ability to utilise the so-called 'Creeping Barrage' tactic, which we can use to scare enemies out of their hiding places before an advance."
 FAT_mass_1:0 "Every Griffon a Soldier"
 FAT_mass_1_desc:0 "While producing millions of extra shells or drawing up extensive battleplans sounds good, it is also very time intensive and not worth the effort. Instead, we should attempt to draft every able-bodied Griffon, hand him a gun and send him to the front. That way, we will have no shortage of troops, and we will be practically unbeatable."
 FAT_mass_2:0 "Convince Militias To Join"
 FAT_mass_2_desc:0 "There are many more or less loyal local militias roaming our country. If we could get in contact with their leaders, and hopefully offer them amnesty, riches, or just promise to grant them some enemy to shoot at, we might be able to get many of these militias to join our army as the backbone of new units."
 FAT_mass_3:0 "Amnesty Program"
 FAT_mass_3_desc:0 "Instead of offering amnesty only to leaders and officers, we will offer it to every Griffon who has ever fought against us. This will surely help us bolster the ranks."
 FAT_mass_4:0 "Redemption in Death"
 FAT_mass_4_desc:0 "We could extend our Amnesty Program to every prisoner, POW, terrible criminal, or just common thief in our Country. We will give them all the chance to redeem themselves, no matter what crimes they have committed, so long as they agree to fight in our ranks."
 FAT_marshal_rifle:0 "Sensible Gun Laws"
 FAT_marshal_rifle_desc:0 "If there is ample amount of something in our country, it would be guns. From all the conflicts that took place recently, and also because of the increased militarisation in general, it isn’t even that hard to find places with unguarded and uncared for stockpiles of them. By regaining control over these vast amounts of stockpiles, we could use the weapons to bolster and arm the ranks of the Army."
 FAT_marshal_rifle_quality:0 "Quality over Quantity"
 FAT_marshal_rifle_quality_desc:0 "After gathering this many guns, our military staff has realised that the Quantity of guns doesn't matter if the gun itself is faulty and outdated. We will instead use our expertise to create better, higher quality weapons."
 FAT_marshal_rifle_quantity:0 "More Gun"
 FAT_marshal_rifle_quantity_desc:0 "All you need to fight a bad guy is a gun. And if that don't work, use more gun."
 FAT_arty:0 "Modernise Artillery Guns"
 FAT_arty_desc:0 "Now that our troops are properly equipped with rifles, we need to turn our attention towards bigger caliber artillery guns. If we were to use the experience we have gathered while working on the carbines, it's quite possible we would be able to greatly improve our current design."
 FAT_sup:0 "Reorganize Support Units"
 FAT_sup_desc:0 "While the frontline troops are the main heroes, we mustn't forget about the support units in our army, who make sure everygriff has ammunition and supplies. To ensure just this, we must reorganise their support battalions into a more effect unit."
 FAT_magic_equip:0 "Magi-tek Rifles"
 FAT_magic_equip_desc:0 "Using magical crystals, we are able to create an entirely new kind of gun, one that isn't using ballistic energy but magic instead. Such guns might revolutionise the very nature of warfare. Our lands are rich with the crystals needed to power these weapons, so it would be a waste not to use them effectively."
 FAT_motorized_equip:0 "Mechanise our Army"
 FAT_motorized_equip_desc:0 "While Trucks are an incredibly valuable and effective vehicle to use for transport of troops and supplies, it is also quite evident that they are vulnerable to any sort of incoming fire. Engineers have proposed that we construct an armoured transport vehicle instead, this way our troops can also be transported much closer to the frontline."
 FAT_tanks:0 "An Armoured Spearhead"
 FAT_tanks_desc:0 "Tanks have become one of the most important and powerful assets in modern warfare. Many of our neighbours, like us, have neglected and ignored this fact for the longest time, but no more! Our research and production on this new sort of vehicle shall commence as soon as possible!"

 griffonRepublic.0.t:0 "The Dream of a Republic"
 griffonRepublic.0.a:0 "Our Republic has not yet been lost."
 griffonRepublic.0.d:0 "The Griffonian Republic was born in the chaotic year of 978, when the common people had had enough of being used by debauch and corrupted nobility. After that, we assumed power over all of Griffonia, although sadly, the local nobility and oligarchs were doing everything they could to undermine our new regime. With the Kingdom of Wingbardy and Aquileia leaving the Republic, many more nobles followed suit, launching a counter-revolution and forcing us to withdraw here, to the cold north.\n\nBut all hope for the Republic is not yet lost. While the past few years haven't been easy for us, the time has come to finally reform our state and give every Griffon, Pony, and other Creature a voice. We face many threats outside and inside the Country, and yet our Republican spirit and dream will live on. Griffonia will be free!"
 griffonRepublic.2.t:0 "Griffonian Republic has invited us to the Republican Pact"
 griffonRepublic.2.d:0 "We have been invited by the Griffonian Republic to join the Republican Pact, a military, economic and political alliance that aims to unite all Griffonian Republics against foreign aggression. In the event of invasion, they would lend us a claw or, if they are attacked, we would be obliged to aid them, in turn."
 griffonRepublic.2.a:0 "Yes, we will join the Republic in their struggle."
 griffonRepublic.1.b.tp:0 "We cannot agree on a full alliance, but we will agree on mutual gurantees."
 griffonRepublic.2.b:0 "We cannot join them, but we would appreciate their help."
 griffonRepublic.2.c:0 "We are better off on our own."
 griffonRepublic.6.t:0 "A pretender state has joined our Faction!"
 griffonRepublic.6.d:0 "We have just received confirmation that one of the pretender states officially agreed to join our faction!"
 griffonRepublic.6.a:0 "Great!"
 griffonRepublic.66.t:0 "Mutual Guarantees"
 griffonRepublic.66.d:0 "One of the pretender states has decided that it would be in their best interest to join our pact, though they have made it clear that they did not want to fully commit, and thus we have only exchanged mutual guarantees."
 griffonRepublic.66.a:0 "Works for me."
 griffonRepublic.7.t:0 "Pretender State refuses!"
 griffonRepublic.7.d:0 "It seems that one of the pretender states we had invited has refused to join our struggle, as we have just received confirmation that they don't wish to partake in our projects..."
 griffonRepublic.7.a:0 "What a Shame."
 griffonRepublic.3.t:0 "Republican Struggle."
 griffonRepublic.3.d:0 "Many years have passed since we have split from the Republican movement headed by [From.GetLeader]. During this time, our policies of socialism and equality have stalled, while the Griffonian Republic, is currently on its way to a prosperous new age, stronger than ever. Perhaps it is time to rethink our stance towards them?"
 griffonRepublic.3.a:0 "We will aid the Republic as a partner."
 griffonRepublic.3.b:0 "We must reapproach the Republican authorities and aid them where we can."
 griffonRepublic.3.c:0 "No, Kemerskai is the same kind of tyrant that we have vowed to fight against in 978!"
 griffonRepublic.8.t:0 "[SRS.GetName] agrees!"
 griffonRepublic.8.d:0 "Our common-folk from [SRS.GetName] have agreed to join us in a faction in order to help our common cause of equality and fairness. This marks the first time our two states have entered any sort of diplomatic agreement since the great split of the National Republican Party."
 griffonRepublic.8.a:0 "Our old time grudges have been forgotten!"
 griffonRepublic.88.t:0 "[SRS.GetName] submits!"
 griffonRepublic.88.d:0 "In a truly unexpected turn of events, [SRS.GetName] has sent us a diplomatic note saying that they wish to help us however they can in establishing a better country for every-creature in Griffonia, and that they wish to submit their state apparatus to us, so that we can reach this goal together."
 griffonRepublic.88.a:0 "We welcome our Griffon brethren!"
 griffonRepublic.9.t:0 "[SRS.GetName] refuses!"
 griffonRepublic.9.d:0 "We received nothing more than a small note on which is scribbled that we are no better than all the other warlords and dictators on this Continent."
 griffonRepublic.9.a:0 "Socialists have never been very reasonable, have they..."
 griffonRepublic.10.t:0 "Unrest on the Rise"
 griffonRepublic.10.d:0 "After a series of events, it appears both the public and our own staff has become quite unrestful. Citizens are starting to join radical elements of Society, such as the Communists, and large scale protests have already been announced. On another note, some of our military staff is said to be planning some form of conspiracy against us. Whether these myths are true or not, we don't know, but these are dangerous and worrying developments, for sure."
 griffonRepublic.10.a:0 "Ignore them, just the usual wave of rowdys causing trouble"
 griffonRepublic.10.b:0 "Arrest the Troublemakers! Our Country must remain stable!"
 griffonRepublic.11.t:0 "Soldiers are refusing Orders!"
 griffonRepublic.11.d:0 "Today our crisis has taken a turn for the worse, as almost all of our military units have refused their given Orders. This has already happened once or twice in our recent history, and did not end well for us, even then. It's time we did something against this."
 griffonRepublic.11.a:0 "They're just begging for more pay. Let them rebel all they want."
 griffonRepublic.11.b:0 "Send in our loyal troops to take care of these traitors!"
 griffonRepublic.12.t:0 "The Edge of the Abyss"
 griffonRepublic.12.d:0 "We are on the brink of collapse. The Mutiny in the Army has spread, and even officials of the government are now starting to rebel and ignore our instructions. Citizens, seeing all of this, are starting to arm themselves, and already there have been clashes between militias and disloyal soldiers in the streets. This is our last chance to break this rebellion apart, or our Nation could very well fall apart."
 griffonRepublic.12.a:0 "We mustn't kill our own citizens. Negotiate with the Rebels."
 griffonRepublic.12.b:0 "Rally our loyalist troops and crack down on these traitors!"
 griffonRepublic.13.t:0 "Civil War"
 griffonRepublic.13.d:0 "It's too late. The mutineers, deserters and protesters have gathered under the banner and command of some of our old guard Generals. They demand much, but most importantly hate our regime. Republic and our Leader. It shouldn't have come to this... but it's time to fight, once again. Time to fight for our liberty!"
 griffonRepublic.13.a:0 "To Arms!"
 griffonRepublic.18.t:0 "General Rosewing Expedition"
 griffonRepublic.18.d:0 "General Rosewing is one of most prominent warlords in the Republic, yet at same time, his troops and his mandate are supported by our government Yet he only seems to act more independently every day, lately his forces even have been raiding local encampments of troops loyal to us. We cannot let Rosewing grow stronger. We either need to bring Rosewing and his griffons under our control, or make sure they are dealt with."
 griffonRepublic.18.a:0 "Organize our most loyal soldiers, equip them, and send them to bring Rosewing back under our command, or to deal with him appropriately."
 griffonRepublic.19.t:0 "Rosewing Rebelion"
 griffonRepublic.19.d:0 "General Rosewing refused to submit to our forces, as soon as they managed to give him our demands, they were fired on. In the skirmish that ensured we have lost around thirty griffons, while the enemy has lost around fifteen. Our forces have retreated and informed us about the situation. We are currently mobilizing all of our loyal warlords, militias, and soldiers we have in the area. We will hunt Rosewing and his thugs down, and we will show them why they shouldn't dare to shoot even a single bullet at Republican forces."
 griffonRepublic.19.a:0 "Local units won't be enough, mobilize the entire Army of the Republic."
 griffonRepublic.199.t:0 "Rosewing submits to authority of the Republic."
 griffonRepublic.199.d:0 "Surprisingly enough, Rosewing claimed that he didn't know about the raids, and that his recent independent actions were caused by miscommunication and insubordination of his soldiers. He promised to us that he will punish everyone responsible, and make sure this never occurs again. But what is more important then this suspicious story is the fact that he had agreed on submitting to our authority, and even change most of his staff and officers, onto the kind that would be more loyal to us."
 griffonRepublic.199:0   "Seems that Rosewing won't be making any troubles for us, at least for time-being."
 griffonRepublic.198.t:0 "Successful apprehension of Rosewing."
 griffonRepublic.198.d:0 "General Rosewing has been arrested, reports that we got from the field are not too clear, but it seems that as soon as our troopers approached his quarters, they were fired on. After a short exchange of fire, that left few of our soldiers wounded and dead, they had managed to storm their defenses, and as soon as that has happened, all of Rosewing soldiers, with him included, had mass-capitulated to our forces."
 griffonRepublic.198:0  "Good, we have to make sure that Rosewing trial will be as public as possible, we need to show every warlord what happens when they go against The Republic."
 griffonRepublic.20.t:0 "The Bandit Problem"
 griffonRepublic.20.d:0 "Ever since the establishment of our Republic, bandits, marauders, and other criminals were a true problem for everyone not living in the middle of a big city, many years had passed since, but they had stayed a strong thorn against our government. But that has recently changed, as we now put more of our attention on bringing them down, and we can at least guarantee that major roads and communication paths are safe from them. Yet we cannot stop now, there are still smaller and bigger villages and cities being terrorized by them, and many of smaller roads are still infested with that pest."
 griffonRepublic.20.a:0 "Intensify our efforts, make sure that every road, and every city in the Republic is safe."
 griffonRepublic.21.t:0 "Banditry dealt with"
 griffonRepublic.21.d:0 "Today marks the first day when no city in our Republic, nor a road, is taken over by bandits. Our campaign to eradicate them was hard and bloody, but it has payed off in the end, and most of our citizens can now sleep soundly, as we made sure that remaments of once great gangs, bands, and groups had been driven into hiding. But we cannot make a mistake here, even though they hide in forests, and in less scrupulous parts of our cities, they could still return to their old ways if we won't push them even harder."
 griffonRepublic.21.a:0 "Make sure that army scouts every single Forest or hiding hole in the countryside."
 griffonRepublic.22.t:0 "Criminals Purged"
 griffonRepublic.22.d:0 "We just got report in, our armed forces have managed to find and swiftly deliver justice to the last band of 'Priesthood' gang. It's quite an interesting end to our campaign, seeing how 'Priesthood' was the first criminal organization in the Republic. With their end, an age in the history of our country ends. Where once was lawlesness, now there is order, where once every well meaning griff was afraid to go out at night, now you can meet all kinds of merry griffons celebrating whatever occasion, or just having fun together, where once most of the roads had to be traveled together with armed escort, now you can see lone mothers with children going on about their day, more then sure about their safety."
 griffonRepublic.22.a:0 "Truly, what we had achieved today, will make the lifes of every one of our citizens better."
 griffonRepublic.42.t:0 "The State of the Countryside"
 griffonRepublic.42.d:0 "Today some truly terrifying reports have reached Cloudbury. It seems that some of smaller villages, and cities are reporting that they aren't getting enough of food delivered to them. It's nothing that surprising considering that our countryside is in chaos, but if we won't be able to fix that, this could lead to some truly worrying consequences."
 griffonRepublic.42.a:0 "Make sure that reports reaching us are true, and this this isn't some overreaction."
 griffonRepublic.43.t:0 "The State of the Countryside"
 griffonRepublic.43.d:0 "The Situation in the countryside is bone-chilling, as it seems that previous reports weren't overblown, and were true. What is worse, at this point most of the farmers and places that produce food either keep it for themselves, or sell it privately at greatly inflated prices. And any transports of food are already at great risk of being raided by greedy bandits, or just by starving and desperate griffons. If we wish not to have a catastrophe in our Republic, we should do something."
 griffonRepublic.43.a:0 "Send armed guards together with transports, inspect every mill and every farm for suspicious surplus of food."
 griffonRepublic.44.t:0 "Famine recovery"
 griffonRepublic.44.d:0 "Since the start of our efforts aimed at stopping, and making the famine less deadly, we have managed to help countless griffons, and to keep many more from dying. While situation isn't perfect now, more and more farms and mills are returning to their usual production quotas. But it will still take time before we can safely let things run on their own, especially since there is still few places where hunger is a very real danger to everyone."
 griffonRepublic.44.a:0 "Focus on making everything returning to work as normal."
 griffonRepublic.45.t:0 "Famine is over"
 griffonRepublic.45.d:0 "Today marks the day when the Famine has ended, and our food supply is as good as never before. It wasn't easy, and we sadly have to count death in thousands, but this must serve as a warning to us all, that we shouldn't let ever again for such chaos to run wild among in countryside. And as such, our policies of soldiers escorting supply trains, and that of inspections, are here to stay."
 griffonRepublic.45.a:0 "Good, if a slight centralization is the biggest price we pay for making sure that today every griff will eat until he is full, so be it."
 griffonRepublic.50.t:0 "Vedina Question"
 griffonRepublic.50.d:0 "Vedina is a monarchy, same sort that we had tried to destroy in the year 978, and yet they are probably the only monarchy on the entire Griffonian continent that cares about every single one of their citizens, and where the king acts as an administrator of the realm, and treats every griff with the same rights, no matter if griff is a nobleman, or a commoner. As such, we have to make a hard decision of our policy towards them. We either let monarchy prosper for now, under a wise and caring king, yet risk yet another tyrant rising in the future. But to make sure that won't happen, we also could invade them, and make sure that monarchy will never be a threat to Vedina people, yet it would be such a shame to fight against such a nice King... "
 griffonRepublic.50.a:0 "Until they are just, they are same as us, even if their leader is named a King."
 griffonRepublic.50.b:0 "Sometimes, we have to do things we don't like, and we just have to make sure that the threat of monarchy will be destroyed."
 griffonRepublic.51.t:0 "We have been invited to a faction by [FAT.GetName]"
 griffonRepublic.51.d:0 "Today we had been invited to a common faction by [FAT.GetName], they are a republican break-away state from the Griffonian Empire. And they are one of not many nations around us who really gives a damn about the griffons they rule, even if their management isn't the most efficient one. We should take note however, that they are republican to the very depth of their hearts, and as such, if we would refuse, it could anger them into doing something unwise. Yet, at same time, agreeing to getting a common faction with them, while beneficial to commonfolk, could drag us into a bloody and long war with some of the monarchies around."
 griffonRepublic.51.a:0 "Even if we will fight a war, it is worthy for the Republic."
 griffonRepublic.51.b:0 "We cannot ally with such fanatics as the Republic."
 griffonRepublic.52.t:0 "Vedina agrees!"
 griffonRepublic.52.d:0 "The wise King of Vedina has agreed to an alliance with us, , citing goodness that we can do for common-folk in both of our countries, and how we are the only nations that care for the wellbeing of our citizens."
 griffonRepublic.52.a:0 "This calls for celebration, we had just meet a first king who isn't a power-hungry despot, and is completely reasonable."
 griffonRepublic.53.t:0 "Vedina refuses"
 griffonRepublic.53.d:0 "As could have been expected, Vedina has disagreed to join our faction, calling us warmongers, and telling us that we would cause thousands of deaths, just for political gains. As always, these are typical monarchist lies, still, it's a bit disappointing that supposedly such a wise and caring king would not agree to join us. But in the end, all monarchies are the same, and this only further proves it."
 griffonRepublic.53.a:0 "King will always be a king, it seems. But, we will liberate people of Vedina from their tyrant soon enough."
 griffonRepublic.54.t:0 "[FAT.GetName] demands our integration into the Republic."
 griffonRepublic.54.d:0 "After [FAT.GetName] had defeated Griffon Empire, and now they are demanding for every state in Griffonia to join their republic. If we would do that, we would have to say goodbye to any of our independence, but otherwise... we might be risking war with The Republic, and that could be very dangerous, or very bloody."
 griffonRepublic.54.a:0 "We have no choice to agree."
 griffonRepublic.54.b:0 "We won't give our independence away to some silly republican pretenders."
 griffonRepublic.55.t:0 "Pretender State agrees on Integration"
 griffonRepublic.55.d:0 "One of the many pretender-state that was born out of the ineptness of the empire has agreed to join us as a republic member state, we give them right to limited autonomy, and having their own elected leaders, but they are our allies and stand together with us when it comes to: Foregin Policy, Military, Science, and Economy. "
 griffonRepublic.55.a:0 "Very good, one potential tyrannical dictatorship less."
 griffonRepublic.56.t:0 "Pretender State refuses Integration"
 griffonRepublic.56.d:0 "One of the pretender-state that has stood with us refuses to bend their knees to us, if we wish to keep our reputation as a major country, and strong player in region, we shouldn't let that go unpunished. "
 griffonRepublic.56.a:0 "Banish them from our faction, they better be glad, we haven't decided to punish them more."
 griffonRepublic.56.b:0 "We need them, for now, but we shall remember this, but as soon as we don't..."
 griffonRepublic.67.t:0 "The Return to Griffenheim"
 griffonRepublic.67.d:0 "Victory! Finally, our long exile ends, and we are back to where the Republic was born - Griffenheim. Now that the city is ours, and resistance has been quelled, we need to decide what kind of a Republic we wish to become. Should we strive for more Centralisation or Decentralisation? Should we reform our administration? There are many questions that must not be tackled."
 griffonRepublic.67.a:0 "Decentralisation has only lead us to near collapse, in the past."
 griffonRepublic.67.b:0 "We will stay true to the ideals that led us in 978."
 griffonRepublic.67.c:0 "An alliance of Griffon nations"

 griffonRepublic.68.t:0 "The Three Principles of the Republic"
 griffonRepublic.68.d:0 "After many years, the Republic is ready to fully embrace its revolutionary principles. Liberty, Democracy and Prosperity. The President-Marshal has announced that the Republic has come a long way, and that the Nation could now finally move on to realise these three important Principles of mind. Our previous instability and insecurity is a thing of the past, we stand united under the Banner of the Tricolour!"
 griffonRepublic.68.a:0 "Liberty, Democracy and Prosperity for all!"

 griffonRepublic.69.t:0 "Elections!"
 griffonRepublic.69.d:0 "Our great President-Marshal Keremersaki has decided that the Republic is ready for its first official General Election. With his resignation, many popular politicians have scrambled and tried to gain the support of the populace. The two most popular ones are Heinrich Kingfeather and Schnabel Sunglider.\n\nHeinrich is a firm believer in political neutrality, believing that it would further advance our economic wealth and political stability if our Nation decided to stay out of foreign affairs. On the other claw, Schnabel, a young revolutionary, firmly believes in the ideals of the Republican Revolution. He argues that a stance of neutrality would mean leaving defenseless Griffons in other countries to their fate of being oppressed by Monarchs, Dictators and the like.\n\nIt was a heated and yet very short election campaign, and the results are finally in..."
 griffonRepublic.69.a:0 "Heinrich Kingfeather wins!"
 griffonRepublic.69.b:0 "Schnabel Sunglider becomes president!"

 griffonRepublic.70.t:0 "Marshal Keremersaki passes away"
 griffonRepublic.70.d:0 "Sad news have just reached us. Our Great President-Marshal, Keremersaki, has unfortunately passed away. His death has caused a great amount of mourning among the populace. Many have, and still do look up to him as one of greatest revolutionaries to date. Without his great deeds, the Republic as it is today would not have come to be. Great monuments shall be erected to honour his great person and even greater deeds.\n\nThe Republic says its last farewell to the Hero of the Revolution, and appreciates his hard work and dedication."
 griffonRepublic.70.a:0 "May he rest in Peace"

 griffonRepublicNews.1.t:0 "[event_target:equestria.GetName] recognizes [FAT.GetName]"
 griffonRepublicNews.1.d:0 "Today, after several meetings between envoys of [event_target:equestria.GetName] and the Griffonian Republic, [event_target:equestria.GetLeader] has officially recognized the Republic as the rightful Griffonian government. In addition, an official statement was made, saying that the Republicans only wish to bring Liberty, Democracy and Prosperity, and that the success of the Republic would spell an end to oppression on the continent. The Griffonian Empire has followed suit by denouncing the [event_target:equestria.GetLeader] and the "rotten country" of [event_target:equestria.GetName]."
 griffonRepublicNews.1.a:0 "We thank our friends in Equestria"

 griffonRepublicNews.2.t:0 "The tricolour in Griffenheim"
 griffonRepublicNews.2.d:0 "Today, the Republican tricolour has been raised on top of the Imperial Palace in Griffenheim, former Capital of the Griffonian Empire. This marks a major victory for the Republican forces, who have largely consolidated their hold over the former Imperial Territory through their promises of reform and peace. The President-Marshal of the Republic, Keremersaki, has proclaimed that every Griffon shall come to enjoy the fundamental rights of Liberty, Democracy and Prosperity within their new borders. Whether this will become a reality is, however, uncertain.\n\nThe Republicans stand victorious over their old, aristocratic rivals, and a new era begins for Griffonia, one headed by the Republic."
 griffonRepublicNews.2.a:0 "A new era indeed!"
 griffonRepublicNews.2.b:0 "Interesting"
 griffonRepublicNews.2.c:0 "Impressive"
 griffonRepublicNews.2.e:0 "Terrible!"

 griffonRepublicNews.3.t:0 "Marshal Keremersaki passes away"
 griffonRepublicNews.3.d:0 "The President-Marshal of the Griffonian Republic, Keremersaki, has passed away, today. His death marks the start of a time of mourning within the Republic, as the people say goodbye to their greatest Hero of the Republican Revolution. During the Revolution, Keremersaki lead the Republic towards independence.\n\nThe Republic mourns, and a great statesman and leader is lost."
 griffonRepublicNews.3.a:0 "The Republic will never forget its Marshal"
 griffonRepublicNews.3.b:0 "One less troublemaker to worry about"
 griffonRepublicNews.3.c:0 "A great hero passes away"
 griffonRepublicNews.3.e:0 "About time he bites the dust"

 griffonRepublic.71.t:0 "Choosing Our Military Doctrine"
 griffonRepublic.71.d:0 "Representatives of many generals, and warlords from our HQ had approached us recently, all of them proposing all kinds of ideas how to reform our armed forces, and in what direction to take them. All of these plans have their pros and cons, but sadly we have to follow one, as it would be simply impossible to keep our armed forces organized otherwise, as such, we have to decide."
 griffonRepublic.71.a:0 "We will have superior organization, and planning: Doctrine of Grand Battle Plan"
 griffonRepublic.71.b:0 "We will drown enemy in our shells, while being safe ourselves: Doctrine of Firepower"
 griffonRepublic.71.c:0 "We will engage every griff from our nation in our great struggle: Doctrine of mass assault"
 griffonRepublic.80.t:0 "Call to Arms"
 griffonRepublic.80.d:0 "News just arrived that [GRI.GetName] has attacked one of the Republican Pact members. As a Member of the Pact, we are legally obliged to declare war on the Empire and join our allies in their struggle. However, the chances of us successfully standing up to the Empire's might are slim, indeed. It would be dishonourable, but perhaps we should ignore this incident and bide our time..."
 griffonRepublic.80.a:0 "We will honour the Pact. To Arms!"
 griffonRepublic.80.b:0 "There is nothing we can do"
 griffonRepublic.90.t:0 "The Griffonian Republic"
 griffonRepublic.90.d:0 "Before its collapse to inner debauchery and corruption, the Griffonian Empire was a warmongering, despotic state which oppressed its many minorities, one of which were Ponies. During one of many revolts, the Griffonian Republic was born under the ideals of Prosperity, Democracy and Liberty. The Republic has sent us a note asking for support in order to fend off any enemy of Republicanism. What should we do?"
 griffonRepublic.90.a:0 "We will send them a stockpile of Equipment and acknowledge them as the rightful owner of Griffonia."
 griffonRepublic.90.b:0 "Send them a secret shipment of guns."
 griffonRepublic.90.c:0 "Recognise them to be the rightful owner of Griffonia."
 griffonRepublic.90.e:0 "They are outside of our sphere of influence."
 griffonRepublic.91.t:0 "Equestrian Help"
 griffonRepublic.91.d:0 "Equestrian Diplomats have arrived, handing us a note by the Princess that they hereby officially recognise us to be the rightful owner of all of Griffonia. Additionally, to support our struggle, they have sent us a stockpile of equipment, mostly guns."
 griffonRepublic.91.a:0 "Not all Monarchs are bad, after all"
 griffonRepublic.92.t:0 "Equestrian Equipment"
 griffonRepublic.92.d:0 "Equestrian Agents have contacted us with a secret note and shipment from Equestria. The note came from the Princess and specifies that this deal must be kept a secret, so as to not ruin Equestrian reputation. Inside the shipment we found a large pile of Equestrian guns."
 griffonRepublic.92.a:0 "We appreciate their support nonetheless."
 griffonRepublic.93.t:0 "Equestrian Approval"
 griffonRepublic.93.d:0 "Equestria has sent us a note in which they officially announce us to be the believed rightful owner over all of Griffonia. Unfortunately, it appears they were unable to support our struggle with material support."
 griffonRepublic.93.a:0 "Guns would have helped, but I guess this will do."
 griffonRepublic.94.t:0 "Equestrian Silence"
 griffonRepublic.94.d:0 "Equestria has remained silent on the matter of whether or not to support us in our struggle. Additionally, all Equestrian diplomats previously flown in were now withdrawn. Our own diplomats are furious."
 griffonRepublic.94.a:0 "We should have known that Monarchs are all and the same!"

 griffonRepublic.60.t:0 "The invention of Beaklle"
 griffonRepublic.60.d:0 "From a rundown suburb of our fair capital comes an invention which will change the lives of many. A simple school griffon has come up with a completely new way of writing down griffonian using new methods of printing. The method involves printing repeating patterns of dots onto paper, yet these dots do not use any ink at all. The new printer pushes small bumps into the paper. What use is this? Well, up until now the blind have been unable to read. Yet the inventor, who is blind himself, professes this new technique allows blind griffons to read. The invention has taken the educaton establishment by storm and two different schools for the blind have just opened in our capital."
 griffonRepublic.60.a:0 "The blind can read. Good for them!"

 griffonRepublic.61.t:0 "It comes from the lake"
 griffonRepublic.61.d:0 "Reports have come in of a strange sighting from Lake Fenfir. Apparently a group of local youths were having a party at the edge of the lake when a black figure rose from the depths of the waters. They alledge to have been attacked, and while authorities have officially disregarded the incident as just some teenagers experimenting with hallucinagens, sightings of the creature have increased. In fact, it's become a bit of a tourist attraction. Any concrete evidence of the creature's existance however has not been found."
 griffonRepublic.61.a:0 "Someone will make money out of this"

 griffonRepublic.62.t:0 "The Perfeatherain Affair"
 griffonRepublic.62.d:0 "Scandal shook the parliment today as it was heard that the secretary of defence, Jaxon Perfeatherain, was involved in an affair with a prostitute. If this wasn't embarassing enough, the prostitute in question, Cataleene Chickela was reportedly also sleeping with another griffon who just so happens to be a known spy for the Communist Revolution Front! Fears that state secrets may have been revealed to Ms Chickela and then passed on through pillowtalk have resulted in calls for the defence secretary to resign, pending further inquiry of ill conduct. Jaxon Perfeatherain denies any claims of ill conduct, but has tendered his resignation to the president. In his leaving speech from the senate, he regretted the loss of confidence in him and spoke of a desire to spend more time with family."
 griffonRepublic.62.a:0 "How embarassing!"

 griffonRepublic.63.t:0 "Only 500 Homes?"
 griffonRepublic.63.d:0 "This week has been marred with controversy as Secretary of Housing Tarold Wingwillian made a spectacular blunder in his address to the senate. Somehow his personal assistant had mistyped his speech and missed two entire zeros on the end of a number. Thus, instead of winning national support for our new housing project to build fifty thousand homes, the government has been belittled and ridiculed for pledging only to build five hundred homes. Worse, the Secretary of Housing did not notice the mistake and was thoroughly quizzed on it by the opposition."
 griffonRepublic.63.a:0 "Get your act together man"

 griffonRepublic.64.t:0 "The GRS Imperitive"
 griffonRepublic.64.d:0 "One of our newest destroyer models has yesterday gone missing after failing to report in while on maneuvers. After realising the destroyer was lost, our naval group was scrambled to search for the vessel. After a full twelve hours of fruitless searching, the destroyer appeared again, gliding out of thick fog. It was first thought the report was a fake as the position of the destroyer was well out of the area that it could have possibly traveled in that time, yet there it was. Even stranger, it was discovered afterwards that the destroyer was completely unmanned on arrival. The entire crew has been reported missing and the ship has been quarantined for further scientific and magical analysis."
 griffonRepublic.64.a:0 "It's a ghost ship you say?"

 griffonRepublic.65.t:0 "The Puritan Liberation Movement"
 griffonRepublic.65.d:0 "A counter culture has been gaining momentum today, opposed to radical changes in our very society. The Puritan Liberation Movement, as they style themselves, advocates that modern society is too lax about more adult subjects such as sex and relationships. Specifically, they are very concerned about the effect that profanity and violence could be having on the younger generations and advocate for some government controls and censorship of the media to protect those who are more sensitive. Their claims are being investigated by the media regulators, but intervention by central government is not planned as of yet."
 griffonRepublic.65.a:0 "Too much blood and guts for some"

 griffonRepublic.83.t:0 "Vérany and the failed Revolution"
 griffonRepublic.83.d:0 "For the second time in history, the griffons of Aquileia rose to fight for Freedom and for Democracy, and for the second time in history, their efforts were in vain. The Aquileian Republic has once again fallen prey to the corrupt forces of the aristocracy around them, and many heroic, brave minds were lost.\n\nNot all Aquileian revolutionaries were captured following the Republican Defeat, though. The very leader of the Revolution, Théodore Vérany, has managed to evade the enemy by fleeing the country by sea. Now, he has arrived at one of our ports, and the fire of Revolution burns on in his valiant heart. He asks us to grant him refuge and that he be allowed to continue the fight for Democracy and Freedom from here. No doubt, such an experienced and brave revolutionary would be an excellent addition to our Republic, and an even better leader to lead the troops."
 griffonRepublic.83.a:0 "We welcome him with open arms!"
 griffonRepublic.83.b:0 "His Revolution failed, why would we bother with him?"

### Events
penguin.1.t:0 "The Summit at Dachaigh"
penguin.1.d:0 "After almost 4 years in power, King Lolo is nearing the end of his lifespan. The particular breed of penguin he belongs to is a short lived and weak one, but despite this Lolo has proved himself as an amazing and capable leader. Sadly, his time is fast approaching, and before he sets off to join our ancestors in the great beyond, he must first make a decision. Who shall rule after his death? King Lolo has produced no heirs, so he and his council must decide on who shall inherit the throne after he is gone."

penguin.2.t:0 "The Candidates"
penguin.2.d:0 "The great list of candidates has been pulled out and shown to the council, and together they have decided on the best two candidates they could find.

penguin.3.b:0 "Bring me the  list again."

penguin.4.t:0 "Orvar Njordin"
penguin.4.d:0 "Orvar Njordin is a rather peculiar choice from the council. He is an excellent statesmen and has brought prosperity to the city of Dachaigh many times by introducing new reforms and such, on the downside he is perhaps one of the most radical penguins in the kingdom. He has been seen attending fascist groups, a recent thing in Dachaigh, and has even been heard saying rather racist remarks regarding the polar bears and even the griffons."

penguin.17.t:0 "Request from Pingland"
penguin.17.d:0 "The penguins in the north have requested a guarantee from us, claiming that they aren't able to properly defend against the many threats up north. Guaranteeing them would protect one of the few bastions of Harmony in the frozen north."
penguin.17.a:0 "Grant their Request."
penguin.17.b:0 "Decline."

penguin.18.t:0 "Equestria Guarantees us!"

### National Focuses ###
 GRY_raid_brodfeld:0 "Raid Brodfeld"
 GRY_raid_brodfeld_desc:0 "Normally, it would be against our pact with the Griffonian Emperor to raid Brodfeld. However, central authority has crumbled in recent decades, and no Imperial Official has appeared to demand tribute or renewal of our oaths in over a decade. It is safe to assume that the Emperor will not stop us from taking advantage of Brodfeld's instability to line our pockets..."
 GRY_raid_radicals:0 "Raid The GLA"
 GRY_raid_radicals_desc:0 "Ordinarily, we're not supposed to raid anyone west of the river, but surely that doesn't apply to vicious, anti-monarchist radicals? Besides, this "Communism" thing is appealing to an unsettling number of our youth, and it would be good to damage them however we can."
 GRY_prywhen_response:0 "The Red Menace"
 GRY_prywhen_response_desc:0 "The GLA have managed to defeat the King of Brodfeld! This is a terrible threat, for they will surely turn their attention to us soon. We have to do something!"
 GRY_young_socialists:0 "Young Socialist Coup"
 GRY_young_socialists_desc:0 "In the chaos of the Hetman's death, with the nobles falling out with each other over the lack of loot and blaming each other for Bulba's death, the GLA-supported 'Young Socialist Army' has seized control of the government. They have announced various reforms, intended to transition our society to a proper, Communist utopia."
 GRY_centralise:0 "The Struggle For Succession"
 GRY_centralise_desc:0 "With Hetman Bulba's death, the country has fallen into disarray. Many candidates vie for the title of Hetman, but two are emerging as clear frontrunners - Grifnitsky with his supporters in the Viskyo Griffonskoe, and Yevin Krawvelets, the old Hetman's great-nephew."
 GRY_chorna_rada:0 "The Black Rada"
 GRY_chorna_rada_desc:0 "Disaster! The ideological conflict between the two candidates has riled the Rada to a stronger violence than usual, and now their supporters are murdering each other on the streets of Kaiv. If we do not resolve the succession crisis quickly, Gryphia will fall into anarchy."
 GRY_liberate_lushi:0 "The Matter of Lushi"
 GRY_liberate_lushi_desc:0 "[Root.GRYcommLUS]"
 GRY_liberate_gryphus:0 "The Matter of Gryphus"
 GRY_liberate_gryphus_desc:0 "[Root.GRYcommGRU]"
 GRY_raid_season:0 "Gathering the Hosts"
 GRY_raid_season_desc:0 "The time has come to organise the yearly raid. \n\nHetman Calas Bulba has ordered the clan leaders to gather their warriors and assemble on the Brodfeldian border. Due to their ongoing civil war, they will be a good target for our raiders. Let's hope there is still something left to steal."
 GRY_aftermath:0 "Raid Aftermath"
 GRY_aftermath_desc:0 "We're awaiting the return of the raiding party. Hopefully they'll bring back an impressive haul." 
 GRY_rifle_stash:0 "Secret Stashes"
 GRY_rifle_stash_desc:0 "Some of our nobles have contributed their hoarded weapon stashes for the fight against the communist menace. We will overlook this transgression as we need every gun."
 GRY_war_readiness:0 "Rally the Cossacks!"
 GRY_war_readiness_desc:0 "Every proud griffon who calls Gryphia his home must answer the call to arms, for he won't have one if the communists take over!" 
 GRY_rile_up_the_warriors:0 "Anti-Communist Propaganda"
 GRY_rile_up_the_warriors_desc:0 "Our fierce warriors are bloodthirsty and eager to fight. It will be a simple matter to incite them against the Prywhen threat, spreading tales of their supposed cruelty and malice."
 GRY_destroy_the_revolution:0 "End the Revolution!"
 GRY_destroy_the_revolution_desc:0 "The time has come to restore the proper ruler west of the river Evya! The lands of Brodfeld will be free of tyranny!"
 GRY_kickstart_economy:0 "Modern Industrial Methods"
 GRY_kickstart_economy_desc:0 "Eastern Griffonia was never industrially developed compared to the western nations, yet Gryphia is even more economically backwater compared to our closest neighbours. If we intend to survive in this dangerous world, we must bring the industrial revolution to Gryphia."
 GRY_agrarian_future:0 "Physiocracy"
 GRY_agrarian_future_desc:0 "Physiocracy, or fiziokratiya, is a philosophy from Aquileia which states that all wealth comes from nature, and specifically, agriculture. The lush Gryphian plains have always been rich with crops, and it is only natural we adopt this way of thinking by improving our plains."
 GRY_industrial_future:0 "Rapid Industrialisation"
 GRY_industrial_future_desc:0 "The only way to bring Gryphia to current times is with a swift and decisive program of constructing new factories and roads."
 GRY_better_tools:0 "Improved Mining Tools"
 GRY_better_tools_desc:0 "Our mining implements are primitive and crude. We must obtain new tools if we want to improve our resource acquisition."
 GRY_nation_of_farmers:0 "Subsidies for Farmers"
 GRY_nation_of_farmers_desc:0 "The hardy, dedicated farmers are the backbone of this nation, and we should offer them additional benefits and security so that they may continue producing bountiful harvests."
 GRY_infrastructure:0 "Infrastructural Development"
 GRY_infrastructure_desc:0 "The roads outside of Kaiv are practically nonexistant and are little more than trails left by vast Cossack marches. We must connect the rest of our nation."
 GRY_steelmills:0 "Improved Steel Production"
 GRY_steelmills_desc:0 "Our current methods of smelting steel are inefficient and a lot of it gets discarded. Steel mill workers will receive education and new steel smithing tehniques such as the puddle furnace."
 GRY_foreign_direct_investment:0 "Attract Foreign Capital"
 GRY_foreign_direct_investment_desc:0 "Our existing industrial base is small, but a group of businessmen from the Imperial Heartlands seem interested in investing in our burgeoning economy. We should convince them to stay."
 GRY_factory_efficiency:0 "Increase Factory Productivity"
 GRY_factory_efficiency_desc:0 "The factory workers are unfamiliar with their new jobs, and as such productivity is lacking. We will organise classes to instruct our workers to perform better."
 GRY_kaiv_uni:0 "Open the Kaiv University"
 GRY_kaiv_uni_desc:0 "The majority of our nation is illiterate and uneducated. By opening an university in Kaiv, we hope to reverse this trend for the next generation, and increase our base of scientists."
 GRY_modernisation_effort:0 "New Grpyhian Industry"
 GRY_modernisation_effort_desc:0 "We have done much in the previous year to bring Gryphia to a more modern time. It will take longer to catch up with the western nations, but for now Gryphia prospers."
 GRY_electoral_reform:0 "Electoral Reform"

 GRY_solidarity:0 "Unite the Gryphian Tribes"
 GRY_solidarity_desc:0 "Many tribes of Gryphia still resist the new order and refuse to serve in our new army. If we teach them the benefits of communism, and perhaps offer them some incentives, they will see reason and join us in establishing the rule of the proletariat."
 GRY_land_reform_1:0 "Seize Noble Property"
 GRY_land_reform_1_desc:0 "The decadent nobles have done nothing but argue over petty differences and squander their wealth on frivolities. We will confiscate their vast properties and distribute them to our peasants, who are the true future of the state. \n\nThe nobles will undoubtedly be furious with this move, however..."
 GRY_first_universale:0 "Proclaim the Kaiv Commune!"
 GRY_first_universale_desc:0 "We have done much to begin the transition of our nation to a socialist utopia. Let the world that the Kaiv Commune stands strong!"
 GRY_the_reactionary_officers:0 "Fate of the Old Guard"
 GRY_the_reactionary_officers_desc:0 "The time has come to deal with the reactionary element in the army. Thus far we've been supported by the commanders, but our reforms are starting to drift them away from our cause. We must carefully decide what will do."
 GRY_befriend_GLA:0 "[Root.GRYrelGRW]"
 GRY_befriend_GLA_desc:0 "[Root.GRYrelGRW_desc]"
 GRY_we_need_factories:0 "Factories for the People"
 GRY_we_need_factories_desc:0 "A socialist state cannot exist without a worker class, and we have very little factories to speak of. We must put every effort into constructing factories for the people, so that everyone can have a stable employment and income."
 GRY_integrate_cossacks_into_red_army:0 "Red Cossacks"
 GRY_integrate_cossacks_into_red_army_desc:0 "Despite their contrarevolutionary thinking the old guard is still experienced in the art of war. We will indoctrinate them to our cause and show them why they should fight for the revolution."
 GRY_ideological_purity_in_the_army:0 "Rozkozachennya"
 GRY_ideological_purity_in_the_army_desc:0 "The reactionary element in the army cannot be allowed to exist! If we let them be, they'll spread their poisonous ideology and cause a mutiny! We will purge anyone who disagrees with the communist teaching!"
 GRY_revolutionary_arsenals:0 "Weapons of the Revolution"
 GRY_revolutionary_arsenals_desc:0 "The revolution needs to be protected as well, and to fulfill this we will construct factories for the production of firearms, cannons and much more. Long live the free Kaiv Commune!"
 GRY_land_reform_2:0 "Complete the Land Reform"
 GRY_land_reform_2_desc:0 "We have successfully stripped the former nobility of their unjust rights and privileges, and now they are equal like everyone else. They will not cause any more trouble for us."
 GRY_second_universale:0 "Proclaim Our Foreign Policy"
 GRY_second_universale_desc:0 "Now that we have reorganised our state in the proper socialist fashion, it is time to decide how will treat our neighbours at large. \n\nOur hardliner faction believes that we should follow our comrades in Prywhen, but the more independently minded members of the party think we should follow our own path."
 GRY_spread_the_revolution:0 "Revolution Without Borders"
 GRY_spread_the_revolution_desc:0 "While we are very grateful to our benefactors from Prywhen, they do not see that the revolution must be spread to our neighbours, by peaceful change or forced conversion. The oppressed workers will be free!"
 GRY_wittenland_attack:0 "Our Ancient Enemy"
 GRY_wittenland_attack_desc:0 "The unicorns of Wittenland are nothing but a bourgeois menace, leeching upon the hard work of their proletariat. The time has come to end their exploitation."
 GRY_red_education:0 "Socialist Learning"
 GRY_red_education_desc:0 "Education has improved much since recently, but we need to introduce mandatory curriculum to teach the new generation the value of socialism. They will be the young pioneers of the new Gryphia."
 GRY_let_prywhen_lead:0 "Conform to Prywhen"
 GRY_let_prywhen_lead_desc:0 "Our comrades in Prywhen are much more experienced in politics and diplomacy, having gained their knowledge from the home of the revolution itself, Stalliongrad. We will follow them in their foreign doctrine."
 GRY_GRW_army_experience:0 "Mutual Military Exercises"
 GRY_GRW_army_experience_desc:0 "A series of mutual military exercises and war games will be organised to drill our armies. By working together, we will expand our pool of tactics and learn more of modern warfare. The common soldier will also become more dedicated to his comrades-in-arms as well."
 GRY_import_teachers:0 "Invite Educators from Prywhen"
 GRY_import_teachers_desc:0 "Up until recently, the griffons of Prywhen were as uneducated as ours. But the success of the revolution is apparent, and their people are now at the vanguard of socialist thinking. We should request their finest educators to spread the knowledge in Gryphia."
 GRY_brothers_in_revolution:0 "Gryphian-Prywhen Friendship"
 GRY_brothers_in_revolution_desc:0 "Prywhen is a true friend of Gryphian people, as they have shared much of their success with us! Long live the Gryphian-Prywhen friendship!"

 gryphianhost.103.d:0 "In its first official Universale, the Central Rada of the Gryphian Hetmanate has formally declared the dissolution of the old form of government, and has proclaimed that, forthwith, the people of Gryphus are governed by the Kaiv Commune, a proletarian government by the people, and for the people."

 gryphianhost.108.t:0 "A Great Change - If It's Real"
 gryphianhost.108.d:0 "In a shocking twist, our ancient enemies, the Gryphian Host, recently applied for membership in the River Coalition - and River City agreed! Though this has evoked protests from many of our citizens, the Gryphians really do seem to have changed, and [Root.GetLeader] assures the people that everything will be alright, and that the Gryphians will be booted back out at the first sign of trouble. While not everyone is happy with the situation, it seems as if they're putting up with it for the time being."
 gryphianhost.108.a:0 "I'm keeping my eye on them"
 gryphianhost.109.t:0 "Sanity Prevails"
 gryphianhost.109.d:0 "In a shocking twist, our ancient enemies, the Gryphian Host, recently applied for membership in the River Coalition! Thankfully, [From.GetLeader] had enough presence of mind to refuse their offer, not believing their ridiculous claim to have reformed totally."

 gryphianhost.110.t:0 "An Outrage"
 gryphianhost.110.d:0 "Scandal! Horror! The Gryphian Host recently made the shocking move to ask for membership in the River Coalition - and [From.GetLeader] LET THEM IN! [Root.GetLeader] has voiced fierce protests at this shocking betrayal of our people. These Griffons have raided, slaughtered, and plundered our people for centuries, and [From.GetLeader] actually believed their nonsensical claims to have reformed? In response, [Root.GetLeader] has formally left the River Coalition, seeing that it clearly does not have our best interests at heart."
 gryphianhost.110.a:0 "How could River City betray us like that?"
 gryphianhost.111.t:0 "[From.GetName] asks for an alliance"
 gryphianhost.111.d:0 "A strange group of Griffons from the East, calling themselves the [From.GetName], have expressed interest in joining together with us for mutual assistance and protection. These griffons have a history as fierce warriors, and might be a useful addition to our coalition, though they are pretty far away..."
 gryphianhost.111.a:0 "Why would we turn aside potential allies?"

 gryphianhost.114.d:0 "Representatives from the [From.GetName] arrived at government buildings today, in a manner which we've never seen them before. Up until now, the Gryphians had been known as fierce raiders, and we didn't much like meeting them, despite our distant ancestral connection. However, in recent years they have reformed their government into a more peaceful one, and have proclaimed interest in forming a "brotherhood of Zaphzans", which will encompass every Griffon of Zaphzan ancestry, including us. Though we haven't called ourselves Zaphzans for over a thousand years, some within our country think the offer is tempting. How shall we respond?"
 gryphianhost.114.a:0 "We will gladly join this initiative"
 gryphianhost.114.b:0 "We'd rather not commit to something like that."
 gryphianhost.115.t:0 "The Question Of The Crown"
 gryphianhost.115.d:0 "[Root.GetLeader] has thoroughly crushed all opposition and established himself as ruler of the Zaphzans. So great is his power that he might, perhaps, lay claim to the long-defunct title of King of Zaphzia, which would restore the ancient glory of our people. However, we have a long tradition of democratically elected leaders, and it would perhaps be wiser (not to mention less contentious) if he were to simply reaffirm the title of Hetman (though he will not, of course, allow himself to be defeated in an election. That would be silly)."
 gryphianhost.115.a:0 "Hail to the King!"
 gryphianhost.115.b:0 "Of course, we must preserve our democratic traditions..."
 gryphianhost.116.t:0 "Fate Of The Reactionaries"
 gryphianhost.116.d:0 "We are in a difficult position regarding our brother-Cossacks. While a fair few of them supported the GSDLR in their revolution, many of them are staunch supporters of the old order. We cannot afford to ignore this issue, for they are some of our most vocal critics, but by the same token, they are also some of our most skilled military staff. We could simply execute them, but such a move would be deeply unpopular and would leave our military defanged and leaderless. Perhaps it would be better to convince them to join us, so as to integrate them into our new Red Army? This would be much smoother and would allow us to benefit from their extensive experience - but could we ever be certain of their loyalty?"
 gryphianhost.116.a:0 "Pardon them and integrate them into the Red Army"

 gryphianhost.118.d:0 "The griffons of Kaiv have thrown off the chains of oppression and established a socialist state by the banks of the River. Seeing that we also have come to see the eminent glory of socialism, they have offered to forge closer ties with us, to ensure peaceful coopoeration between socialists and defend the revolution from hostile foreign powers. However, there is some dispute among our most prominent officials about how far we ought to take this offer. Most are happy to accept Kaiv's offer of protection, but some wish to go further, and directly join with them against the forces of reaction."
 gryphianhost.118.a:0 "It is fine to defend one another, but we each must build our own socialism"
 gryphianhost.118.b:0 "We are small and surrounded by enemies. Perhaps it would be best to join more closely with them"
 gryphianhost.119.t:0 "The Kaiv Commune proposes a joint offensive"
 gryphianhost.119.d:0 "The Kaiv Commune has approached us with a drastic proposal, one that could significantly affect both of our futures. Militarism is growing within their nation, and their people are eager to spread the Revolution immediately, and by force. This would not be a problem, were it not for the fact that they wish to attack their neighbor, Wittenland. Ruled by a corrupt elite, Wittenland is certainly reactionary and worthy of being destroyed, but they are also protected by the entire River Coalition. A war against them would almost certainly call down the fury of the Riverponies upon our heads, a prospect we cannot take lightly. If we are going to discourage them from this attack, we had better do so now, and forcefully."
 gryphianhost.119.a:0 "Support the offensive! The riverponies must see the light of Communism also!"
 gryphianhost.119.b:0 "This is far too risky, it is insanity! Order them to back down"

They have stated in no uncertain terms that an attack upon Wittenland would result in the destruction of both their nation and ours, and they categorically refuse to help us in any such endeavour. They have presented us a stark choice - give up our goals on Wittenland, or have our alliance formally severed."
 gryphianhost.121.a:0 "Cowards! We will not be dissuaded like this! To war!"
 gryphianhost.121.b:0 "We cannot afford to ruin our relationships with our friends like this - back down on our claims"
 gryphianhost.122.t:0 "[From.GetLeader] severs ties"
 gryphianhost.122.d:0 "The Kaivans have not listened to us, scorning us for our "cowardice" and "revisionism". [From.GetLeader] has formally severed ties with [Root.GetName], and plans for the invasion of Wittenland are proceeding apace."
 gryphianhost.122.a:0 "Those stubborn fools!"
 gryphianhost.123.t:0 "[From.GetLeader] backs down"
 gryphianhost.123.d:0 "Under our threat, [From.GetLeader] has withdrawn their hostile rhetoric towards Wittenland, and quietly shelves their plans for an invasion. It seems that peace, for now, has prevailed."

 gryphianhost.124.t:0 "Re-establishing Contact"

 gryphianhost.125.d:0 "Terrible news! Our seizure of substantial parts of their estates has enraged the aristocrats, and our indecision in decisively stripping away their power has enabled them to rise up. They have banded together with disaffected elements within the military, as well as anti-communists the countryside over, and declared their intent to topple the Government and restore the old Hetmanate. Chaos descends upon our lands, as we slip into civil war..."
 gryphianhost.125.a:0 "The Revolution shall triumph!"
 gryphianhost.125.b:0 "Glory To The Hetman!"

 gryphianhost.126.d:0 "More bad news! We have never been entirely sure of the loyalty of the old officer corps, but they seemed content to work for us in the past. Little did we know that this was only a ruse to buy time! Now that reactionary forces have risen up the overthrow Communism, several of our most skilled generals have defected, declaring their loyalty to the new Hetman and his army."

 gryphianhost.128.a:0 "What a Disappointment"
 gryphianhost.129.t:0 "The Gryphian Host Betrays Its Oath"
 gryphianhost.129.d:0 "To our dismay, the Gryphian Host has violated its oath of loyalty by invading a country that is officially part of our realm. Our guarantees of defense with them are now null and void, and Imperial subsidies to their lands have been frozen indefinitely."
 gryphianhost.129.a:0 "What a pack of traitors!"
 gryphianhost.130.t:0 "We Have Betrayed Our Oath"
 gryphianhost.130.d:0 "Our recent act of war was a clear violation of our treaty to His August Majesty the Emperor. By declaring this invasion, [Root.GetLeader] has placed us all in grave danger. Our guarantees of defense with the Empire are now null and void, and Imperial subsidies to our lands have been frozen indefinitely."
 gryphianhost.130.a:0 "Perhaps this wasn't a good idea..."
 gryphianhost.131.t:0 "The Hetman Request The Restoration of the Border March"
 gryphianhost.131.d:0 "Long ago, Grover I, the august founder of the Empire, made a deal with the Cossacks of the far eastern Riverbank. He would protect them from the predations of the hostile riverponies, in exchange for their loyalty and a cut of the profits from their frequent raids on enemy territory. This agreement was followed for centuries, but in recent decades we have been too weak to enforce payment of the tribute or to prevent minor raids on our nominal subjects. Today, however, seeing our increased strength, the Hetman of the Host has sent an envoy to Griffenheim, asking for the restoration of his people's status as an Imperial March. They will defend the Empire's borders and attack our enemies, in exchange for funding and promises of protection should they be attacked by hostile forces."
 gryphianhost.131.a:0 "So the Cossacks have finally come home, have they? Reinstate the March!"
 gryphianhost.131.b:0 "We don't care about that land anymore"
 gryphianhost.132.t:0 "The Emperor Protects"
 gryphianhost.132.d:0 "To our joy, the Emperor has accepted our request to become an Imperial March. So long as we do not transgress upon the Empire's rightful domain (including territories currently held be disloyal rulers), we should be okay. (NB: Your war declaration screen will warn you if you are about to declare war on someone you're not allowed to)."
 gryphianhost.132.a:0 "Hail the Emperor!"
 gryphianhost.133.t:0 "The Emperor's Scorn"
 gryphianhost.133.d:0 "Sadly, the Emperor has expressed no interest in restoring our status as a border march. It seems he does not care about us, or about the riverland anymore."
 gryphianhost.133.a:0 "How unfortunate"
 gryphianhost.134.t:0 "The Darts Of Fate"
 gryphianhost.134.d:0 "Alas! While being carried by his soldiers during a celebration after their recent raid, Hetman Bulba was shot by a Communist sniper! A dozen Cossacks immediately apprehended the villain and tore him to shreds on the spot, unable to contain their sheer fury, but the damage has been done. The Hetman died instantly, the musket-ball passing cleanly through his brain. His death has killed the normally-joyful mood of victorious warriors, and the raiding party has borne his body home in the old custom, carried on the shoulders of his most devoted warriors. Hetman Bulba led us for over forty years, and he was highly-regarded by all. Worse, he died without leaving a clear heir, meaning that the election of the next Hetman is bound to be fraught with turmoil."

 gryphianhost.135.t:0 "The Darts Of Fate"
 gryphianhost.135.d:0 "Alas! While comforting some of the wounded warriors of his band, despondent after their failed raid, Hetman Bulba was shot by a Communist sniper! A dozen Cossacks immediately apprehended the villain and tore him to shreds on the spot, unable to contain their sheer fury, but the damage has been done. The Hetman died instantly, the musket-ball passing cleanly through his brain. His death has been the last and greatest tragedy on this failed excursion, and the raiding party has borne his body home in the old custom, carried on the shoulders of his most devoted warriors. Hetman Bulba led us for over forty years, and he was highly-regarded by all. However, without the funding that was intended to come from this raid, it is doubtful whether the country will be able to prevent itself from devolving into anarchy and turmoil. Hetman Bulba was the last thread holding together this fractured society, and now that thread has snapped. Anarchy is loose, and the most organised and violent party will win the day."

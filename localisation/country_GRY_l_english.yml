### National Focuses ###
 GRY_raid_brodfeld:0 "Raid Brodfeld"
 GRY_raid_brodfeld_desc:0 "Normally, it would be against our pact with the Griffonian Emperor to raid Brodfeld. However, central authority has crumbled in recent decades, and no Imperial Official has appeared to demand tribute or renewal of our oaths in over a decade. It is safe to assume that the Emperor will not stop us from taking advantage of Brodfeld's instability to line our pockets..."
 GRY_raid_radicals:0 "Raid The GLA"
 GRY_raid_radicals_desc:0 "Ordinarily, we're not supposed to raid anyone west of the river, but surely that doesn't apply to vicious, anti-monarchist radicals? Besides, this "Communism" thing is appealing to an unsettling number of our youth, and it would be good to damage them however we can."
 GRY_prywhen_response:0 "The Red Menace"
 GRY_prywhen_response_desc:0 "The GLA have managed to defeat the King of Brodfeld! This is a terrible threat, for they will surely turn their attention to us soon. We have to do something!"

 GRY_chorna_rada:0 "Chyorna Rada"
 GRY_chorna_rada_desc:0 "Przekleństwo! The ideological conflict between the two candidates has provoked the Rada to greater than usual violence, and now their supporters are murdering each other on the streets of Kaiv.

 GRY_raid_season_desc:0 "The time has come to organise the yearly raid. \n\nHetman Calas Bulba has ordered the clan leaders to gather their warriors and assemble on the Brodfeldian border. Due to their ongoing civil war, they will be a good target for our raiders. Let's hope there is still something left to plunder."

 GRY_rifle_stash:0 "Secret Stashes"

 GRY_kickstart_economy:0 "Modern Industrial Methods"
 GRY_kickstart_economy_desc:0 "Eastern Griffonia was never industrially developed compared to the western nations, yet Gryphia is more of an economic backwater compared to our closest neighbours. If we intend to survive in this dangerous world, we must bring the industrial revolution to Gryphia."
 GRY_agrarian_future:0 "Physiocracy"
 GRY_agrarian_future_desc:0 "Fiziokratiya is a philosophy from Aquileia which states that all wealth comes from nature - specifically agriculture. The lush Gryphian plains have always been rich with crops, and it is only natural that we adopt this way of thinking and improve our own fields."

 GRY_new_arsenals:0 "Firearms Workshops"
 GRY_new_arsenals_desc:0 "Historically, Gryphia has relied on guilds of blacksmiths and gunsmiths to produce weaponry for our armies. However, they cannot keep up with the increasing demands. Therefore, a set of workshops dedicated exclusively to weapon production will be built."
 GRY_better_tools:0 "Improved Mining Tools"

 GRY_solidarity:0 "Unite the Gryphian Tribes"
 GRY_solidarity_desc:0 "Many tribes of Gryphia still resist the new order and refuse to serve in our red army. If we teach them the benefits of communism, and perhaps offer them some incentives, they will see reason and join us in establishing the rule of the proletariat."
 GRY_land_reform_1:0 "Seize Noble Property"
 GRY_land_reform_1_desc:0 "The decadent nobles have done nothing but argue over petty differences and squander their wealth on frivolities.

 GRY_we_need_factories:0 "Factories for the People"

 GRY_integrate_cossacks_into_red_army:0 "Red Cossacks"
 GRY_integrate_cossacks_into_red_army_desc:0 "Despite their counter-revolutionary thinking, the old guard is still experienced in the art of war. We will indoctrinate them to our cause and show them why they should fight for the proletariat."
 GRY_ideological_purity_in_the_army:0 "Rozkozachennya"
 GRY_ideological_purity_in_the_army_desc:0 "The conservative ideas cannot be allowed to exist in the army! If we let them be, they'll spread their poisonous ideology and cause a mutiny! We will remove anyone who disagrees with the communist teachings!"

 GRY_second_universale:0 "Proclaim Our Foreign Policy"
 GRY_second_universale_desc:0 "Now that we have reorganised our state in the proper socialist fashion, it is time to decide how to treat our neighbours at large. Our hardliner faction believes that we should follow our comrades in Prywhen, but the more independently minded members of the party think we should forge our own path. Comrade Khurshevich has the final say in the matter, however."
 GRY_spread_the_revolution:0 "Revolution Without Borders"
 GRY_spread_the_revolution_desc:0 "While we are very grateful to our benefactors from Prywhen, they do not see that the revolution must be spread to our neighbours, by peaceful change or forced conversion. The oppressed workers will be free!"

 GRY_wittenland_attackit:0 "Our Ancient Enemy"
 GRY_wittenland_attackit_desc:0 "The unicorns of Wittenland are nothing but a bourgeois menace, leeching upon the hard work of their proletariat. The time has come to end their endless partying and exploitation." 
 GRY_ask_GRW:0 "Petition Prywhen"
 GRY_ask_GRW_desc:0 "Wittenland is a land that has been constantly oppressed by reactionaries - but unfortunately, they are well protected by the River Coalition. With the assistance of our allies, we will have a much better chance at defeating them, but they may prove reluctant to go to war against the entire Coalition..."
 GRY_wittenland_makefriends:0 "Reach Out To Volaire"
 GRY_wittenland_makefriends_desc:0 "Glorious news! The proletariat in Wittenland have overthrown their aristocratic repressors and established a socialist state!

 GRY_GRW_army_experience_desc:0 "A series of mutual military exercises and war games will be organised to drill our armies.

 GRY_import_teachers:0 "Invite Educators from Prywhen"
 GRY_import_teachers_desc:0 "Up until recently, the griffons of Prywhen were as uneducated as ours. But the success of the revolution is apparent, and their people are now at the vanguard of socialist thinking. We should request their finest educators to spread the knowledge in Gryphia."
 GRY_brothers_in_revolution:0 "Gryphian-Prywhen Friendship"

 GRY_volnoye:0 "Support for Borad Grifnitsky"
 GRY_volnoye_desc:0 "Borad Grifnitsky, son of a minor noble, has been making great strides in support of Harmony among the people of Gryphia and even some other nobles. He believes that by changing our ways for the better, we can become more wealthy and developed. Many in the Rada don't quite agree with such radical changes, but they'd rather have him over Yevin..."
 GRY_monarchy_compromise:0 "A Revised Monarchy"
 GRY_monarchy_compromise_desc:0 "Despite Black Cloak machinations, the Rada has chosen Borad Grifnitsky for Hetman with a comfortable majority. The price of such, however, was that the nobles wouldn't support some of his more sweeping reforms. A compromise is in order."
 GRY_elected_hetman:0 "Let the People Decide"
 GRY_elected_hetman_desc:0 "Yevin and his lackeys have attempted to seize the Rada by force! Fortunately, their low numbers and a passionate speech by our new Hetman made them stand down, either out of shame or pragmatism. As his first act, Borad has ordered to organise an election in which every griffon can vote. He believes that this will show to all the naysayers that the Harmony works."
 GRY_reform_starshina:0 "New Senior Staff"
 GRY_reform_starshina_desc:0 "The high command has grown complacent and unsuited for the threats that challenge our Harmony. New, fresh faces will be hired."
 GRY_form_government:0 "Appoint the New Government"
 GRY_form_government_desc:0 "Hetman Bulba has left little in the way of actual governance, due to his habit of trying to solve most issues by himself. While his competence was not in question, his absence left us without a guiding figure. New ministers and cabinet shall be formed to prevent such from occuring again."
 GRY_strengthen_cossack_radas:0 "Increase Tribal Autonomy"
 GRY_strengthen_cossack_radas_desc:0 "It seems that recent events have divided our nation, more so than usual. Hetman Borad believes that the first step towards a united Gryphia is by giving each clan a proper representation."

 GRY_give_land_to_the_people:0 "Land for the Impoverished"
 GRY_give_land_to_the_people_desc:0 "Most of the people in Gryphia live in abject poverty, having barely any property in their possessions. With land being the most important thing a Gryphian can have, it seems only right we purchase excess noble lands and distribute them fairly to the commonfolk."
 GRY_placate_clans:0 "Tribal Benefits"
 GRY_placate_clans_desc:0 "Our initial efforts have given results, and the clans are slowly drifting towards complete unification. A few more reforms and benefits will convince the most stubborn and independently minded clans."
 GRY_minorities_in_army:0 "Integrate the Clans"
 GRY_minorities_in_army_desc:0 "Every clan's banner now stands under the proud insignia of the united Gryphia! As such, the most successful and influential griffons have offered their pledge, sworn to protect our Harmony."

 GRY_compromise_with_rich:0 "Resolve the Noble Concerns"
 GRY_compromise_with_rich_desc:0 "The nobles are concerned with our reforms, especially with our purchase of their land. As they are still influential and powerful, we need to settle a compromise, unless we want a rebellion on our claws..."
 GRY_education_reform:0 "Begin the Education Reform"
 GRY_education_reform_desc:0 "Education in Gryphia has long been the exclusive domain of the wealthy and powerful. This cannot be allowed to continue. Naturally, this will require us to build many new school buildings and hire educators from abroad the country. Mandatory school enrollment will be enacted for basic education, at least."
 GRY_reinforce_government:0 "Strong Harmonic Government"
 GRY_reinforce_government_desc:0 "The commonfolk of Gryphia are very satisfied with our reforms, and even the nobles, communists and leftovers of the old regimes can't say too many bad things about us. Harmony has taken roots in our land."

 GRY_apply_to_RIV_desc:0 "Even the most optimistic believe this to be a fruitless effort, but Hetman Borad insists we must establish a formal alliance with the Riverponies.

 GRY_federal_investment:0 "Riverpony Investment Program"
 GRY_federal_investment_desc:0 "The impossible has happened! Not only has Hetman Borad returned with positive news, the Riverponies have agreed to invest in our nation!

 GRY_the_between_rivers_concept_desc:0 "Unfortunately, the stark differences between the ponies and us are too vast to overcome, not to mention the centuries of enmity. We will look for allies in our own kin."
 GRY_speak_with_LUS:0 "Lushian Diplomacy"

 GRY_speak_with_GRU:0 "Alliance with Gryphus"
 GRY_speak_with_GRU_desc:0 "The towns of Gryphus are known for their merchants and seafarers, but their military is rather weak. We should approach them for a mutually beneficial alliance."

 GRY_true_hetman:0 "Support for Yevin Krawvelets"
 GRY_true_hetman_desc:0 "Yevin Krawvelets, the last Hetman's grandnephew, is the right choice for our leader. With the backing of wealthy landowners, he will convince the squabbling Rada that only he can bring Gryphia to new glories."
 GRY_proclaim_new_hetmanate:0 "The Rightful Heir"
 GRY_proclaim_new_hetmanate_desc:0 "The Rada has, with a tense majority, chosen Yevin Krawvelets for Hetman. The opposition are disgusted, but their opinion is irrelevant now."

 GRY_pokozachennya_desc:0 "Pokozachennya, or the act of becoming a Cossack, is an ancient ceremony in which an aspiring Cossack was given his shablya and finery, and formally inducted. Today however, we cannot abide by their rigorous requirements, and we must cut the frivolities off, for we require every griffon for our cause."
 GRY_visit_the_people:0 "Public Support for Yevin"
 GRY_visit_the_people_desc:0 "Yevin's rule has already been contested by the nobles, and his popularity is very weak. He has decided that the best course of action is to seek support in the commonfolk, explaining to them that he is saving Gryphia, unlike the treasonous Harmonic supporters."
 GRY_crush_dissent:0 "Eliminate Every Dissenter"
 GRY_crush_dissent_desc:0 "Despite our gentle approach, many of the populace are still unconvinced that Yevin is bringing a positive change. We will have to deal with them, one way or another, before they decide to take up arms and join the rebels."

 GRY_deal_with_traitors_desc:0 "The GSDLR are nothing but Prywhenist agitators, sent to undermine the Gryphian nation! So far, they have not chosen a side in the civil war, but undoubtedly they plan on striking once we are at our weakest. We must deal with this threat immediately."

 GRY_church_support_desc:0 "The common religion of the griffons is prevalent in Gryphia, but our religious leaders are not influential enough compared to the Imperial Heartlands.

 GRY_cossack_reform_desc:0 "Since the days of old, a Gryphian Cossack was a feared sight on the battlefield.

 gryphianhost.103.d:0 "In its first official Universale, the Central Rada of the Gryphian Hetmanate has formally declared the dissolution of the old form of government, and has proclaimed that, forthwith, the people of Gryphus are governed by the Kaiv Commune, a proletarian government by the people, and for the people."
 gryphianhost.103.a:0 "The way of the future!"
 gryphianhost.104.t:0 "The Kaiv Commune reaches out in proletarian solidarity"
 gryphianhost.104.d:0 "The griffons of the Gryphian Host have overthrown their reactionary government, and wish to ally with us in a display of socialist brotherhood! How should we respond?"
 gryphianhost.104.a:0 "We warmly welcome our new comrades!"
 gryphianhost.104.b:0 "They are revisionists - we cannot risk our revolution by associating with them."
 gryphianhost.105.t:0 "A Shocking Proposal"
 gryphianhost.105.d:0 "[Root.GetLeader] has today received an astonishing proposal - so astonishing in fact that it was initially assumed to be a prank. However, we have been assured that, no, the Gryphian Host really does want to join our alliance. Their leader, Borad Grifnitsky, claims to be devoted to harmony, and that his people have turned over a new leaf. Most ponies are skeptical, but some are urging that it might be worth a try - after all, if they renege on their promise, we can always just kick them out again, right? Most Coalition members don't have a particularly strong opinion on this matter, except for three. Lake City and Wittenland are the Gryphians' traditional raid targets and have suffered greatly. The public in these places will be highly resistant to change on this issue. Nimbusia, on the other hand, is far from the Griffons, but regards itself as the protector of all Riverponies, and will not support any action that seems to threaten the safety of the Riverlands. We have sent envoys to each member, and their responses have just returned -\n [Root.NIMreaction] [Root.LCTreaction] [Root.WITreaction]."
 gryphianhost.105.a:0 "If they're both alright with it, then I suppose we can let them in, but keep an eye on them!"
 gryphianhost.105.b:0 "Damn those fools! Don't they see this is a chance to end an ancient grudge?"
 gryphianhost.105.c:0 "Do they really expect us to believe they can change so suddenly?"
 gryphianhost.106.t:0 "Old Wounds Forgiven"
 gryphianhost.106.d:0 "To our great surprise and joy, the Riverponies have seen past the actions of our ancestors, and have recognised our new, Harmonic society. We are now a full-fledged member of the River Coalition!"
 gryphianhost.106.a:0 "Excellent!"
 gryphianhost.107.t:0 "No Water Under That Bridge"
 gryphianhost.107.d:0 "Sadly, though not unexpectedly, the Riverponies have rejected our appeal. We cannot look to them for protection, friendship, or security."
 gryphianhost.107.a:0 "We can't say we really blame them."
 gryphianhost.108.t:0 "A Great Change - If It's Real"
 gryphianhost.108.d:0 "In a shocking twist, our ancient enemies, the Gryphian Host, recently applied for membership in the River Coalition - and River City agreed! Though this has evoked protests from many of our citizens, the Gryphians really do seem to have changed, and [Root.GetLeader] assures the people that everything will be alright, and that the Gryphians will be booted back out at the first sign of trouble. While not everyone is happy with the situation, it seems as if they're putting up with it for the time being."
 gryphianhost.108.a:0 "I'm keeping my eye on them."
 gryphianhost.109.t:0 "Sanity Prevails"
 gryphianhost.109.d:0 "In a shocking twist, our ancient enemies, the Gryphian Host, recently applied for membership in the River Coalition! Thankfully, [From.GetLeader] had enough presence of mind to refuse their offer, not believing their ridiculous claim to have reformed totally."
 gryphianhost.109.a:0 "Good to know that [From.GetLeader] hasn't totally lost their marbles."
 gryphianhost.110.t:0 "An Outrage!"
 gryphianhost.110.d:0 "Scandal! Horror! The Gryphian Host recently made the shocking move to ask for membership in the River Coalition - and [From.GetLeader] LET THEM IN! [Root.GetLeader] has voiced fierce protests at this shocking betrayal of our people. These Griffons have raided, slaughtered, and plundered our people for centuries, and [From.GetLeader] actually believed their nonsensical claims to have reformed? In response, [Root.GetLeader] has formally left the River Coalition, seeing that it clearly does not have our best interests at heart."
 gryphianhost.110.a:0 "How could River City betray us like that?"
 gryphianhost.111.t:0 "[From.GetName] asks for an alliance"
 gryphianhost.111.d:0 "A strange group of Griffons from the East, calling themselves the [From.GetName], have expressed interest in joining together with us for mutual assistance and protection. These griffons have a history as fierce warriors, and might be a useful addition to our coalition, though they are pretty far away..."
 gryphianhost.111.a:0 "Why would we turn aside potential allies?"
 gryphianhost.111.b:0 "We can't afford to defend such a remote location."
 gryphianhost.112.t:0 "[From.GetName] accepts"
 gryphianhost.112.d:0 "[From.GetLeader] has formally accepted [Root.GetLeader]'s offer of military alliance. We are now officially a part of [From.GetName]'s alliance."

 gryphianhost.113.d:0 "[From.GetLeader] has regretfully refused our offer of alliance, citing various problems that would result from it. We will have to look elsewhere for protection."
 gryphianhost.113.a:0 "Drat."
 gryphianhost.114.t:0 "The Gryphians Offer A Union"
 gryphianhost.114.d:0 "Representatives from the [From.GetName] arrived at government buildings today, in a manner which we've never seen them before. Up until now, the Gryphians had been known as fierce raiders, and we didn't much like meeting them, despite our distant ancestral connection. However, in recent years they have reformed their government into a more peaceful one, and have proclaimed interest in forming a "brotherhood of Zaphzans", which will encompass every Griffon of Zaphzan ancestry, including us. Though we haven't called ourselves Zaphzans for over a thousand years, some within our country think the offer is tempting. How shall we respond?"
 gryphianhost.114.a:0 "We will gladly join this initiative."
 gryphianhost.114.b:0 "We'd rather not commit to something like that."
 gryphianhost.115.t:0 "The Question Of The Crown"
 gryphianhost.115.d:0 "[Root.GetLeader] has thoroughly crushed all opposition and established himself as ruler of the Zaphzans. So great is his power that he might, perhaps, lay claim to the long-defunct title of King of Zaphzia, which would restore the ancient glory of our people. However, we have a long tradition of democratically elected leaders, and it would perhaps be wiser (not to mention less contentious) if he were to simply reaffirm the title of Hetman (though he will not, of course, allow himself to be defeated in an election. That would be silly)."
 gryphianhost.115.a:0 "Hail to the King!"
 gryphianhost.115.b:0 "Of course, we must preserve our democratic traditions..."
 gryphianhost.116.t:0 "Fate Of The Reactionaries"
 gryphianhost.116.d:0 "We are in a difficult position regarding our brother-Cossacks. While a fair few of them supported the GSDLR in their revolution, many of them are staunch supporters of the old order. We cannot afford to ignore this issue, for they are some of our most vocal critics, but by the same token, they are also some of our most skilled military staff. We could simply execute them, but such a move would be deeply unpopular and would leave our military defanged and leaderless. Perhaps it would be better to convince them to join us, so as to integrate them into our new Red Army? This would be much smoother and would allow us to benefit from their extensive experience - but could we ever be certain of their loyalty?"
 gryphianhost.116.a:0 "Pardon them and integrate them into the Red Army"
 gryphianhost.116.b:0 "We cannot allow reactionary elements in our army! They must all go!"

 gryphianhost.117.b:0 "We must stand with our older brothers in socialism."
 gryphianhost.117.a:0 "We will spread the revolution, whether alone or not!"
 gryphianhost.118.t:0 "Kaiv Commune proposes closer ties"
 gryphianhost.118.d:0 "The griffons of Kaiv have thrown off the chains of oppression and established a socialist state by the banks of the River. Seeing that we also have come to see the eminent glory of socialism, they have offered to forge closer ties with us, to ensure peaceful cooperation between socialists and defend the revolution from hostile foreign powers. However, there is some dispute among our most prominent officials about how far we ought to take this offer. Most are happy to accept Kaiv's offer of protection, but some wish to go further, and directly join with them against the forces of reaction."
 gryphianhost.118.a:0 "Mutual defense yes, but we each must build our own socialism"
 gryphianhost.118.b:0 "We are small and surrounded. Allies would be useful"
 gryphianhost.119.t:0 "The Kaiv Commune proposes a joint offensive"
 gryphianhost.119.d:0 "The Kaiv Commune has approached us with a drastic proposal, one that could significantly affect both of our futures. Militarism is growing within their nation, and their people are eager to spread the Revolution immediately, and by force. This would not be a problem, were it not for the fact that they wish to attack their neighbor, Wittenland. Ruled by a corrupt elite, Wittenland is certainly reactionary and worthy of being destroyed, but they are also protected by the entire River Coalition. A war against them would almost certainly call down the fury of the Riverponies upon our heads, a prospect we cannot take lightly. If we are going to discourage them from this attack, we had better do so now, and forcefully."
 gryphianhost.119.a:0 "Support the offensive! The riverponies must see the light of Communism also!"
 gryphianhost.119.b:0 "This is far too risky, it is insanity! Order them to back down!"
 gryphianhost.120.t:0 "[From.GetName] backs us"
 gryphianhost.120.d:0 "Our proposal has been heard and accepted by our ally. [Root.GetName] has agreed to join us in the great struggle to free the workers of Wittenland."
 gryphianhost.120.a:0 "To war, then!"
 gryphianhost.121.t:0 "[From.GetName]'s ultimatum"
 gryphianhost.121.d:0 "Our ally has heard our proposal, and responded swiftly. They have stated in no uncertain terms that an attack upon Wittenland would result in the destruction of both their nation and ours, and they categorically refuse to help us in any such endeavour. They have presented us a stark choice - give up our goals on Wittenland, or have our alliance formally severed."
 gryphianhost.121.a:0 "Cowards! We will not be dissuaded like this! To war!"
 gryphianhost.121.b:0 "We cannot afford to ruin our relationships with our friends like this - back down on our claims."
 gryphianhost.122.t:0 "[From.GetLeader] severs ties"
 gryphianhost.122.d:0 "The Kaivans have not listened to us, scorning us for our "cowardice" and "revisionism". [From.GetLeader] has formally severed ties with [Root.GetName], and plans for the invasion of Wittenland are proceeding apace."
 gryphianhost.122.a:0 "Those stubborn fools!"

 gryphianhost.130.t:0 "We have betrayed our Oath"
 gryphianhost.130.d:0 "Our recent act of war was a clear violation of our treaty to His August Majesty the Emperor. By declaring this invasion, [Root.GetLeader] has placed us all in grave danger.

 gryphianhost.130.a:0 "Perhaps this wasn't a good idea..."
 gryphianhost.131.t:0 "The Hetman Request The Restoration of the Border March"
 gryphianhost.131.d:0 "Long ago, Grover I, the august founder of the Empire, made a deal with the Cossacks of the far eastern Riverbank. He would protect them from the predations of the hostile riverponies, in exchange for their loyalty and a cut of the profits from their frequent raids on enemy territory. This agreement was followed for centuries, but in recent decades we have been too weak to enforce payment of the tribute or to prevent minor raids on our nominal subjects. Today, however, seeing our increased strength, the Hetman of the Host has sent an envoy to Griffenheim, asking for the restoration of his people's status as an Imperial March. They will defend the Empire's borders and attack our enemies, in exchange for funding and promises of protection should they be attacked by hostile forces."
 gryphianhost.131.a:0 "So the Cossacks have finally come home, have they? Reinstate the March!"
 gryphianhost.131.b:0 "We don't care about that land anymore."
 gryphianhost.132.t:0 "The Emperor Protects"
 gryphianhost.132.d:0 "To our joy, the Emperor has accepted our request to become an Imperial March. So long as we do not transgress upon the Empire's rightful domain (including territories currently held by disloyal rulers), we should be okay. (NB: Your war declaration screen will warn you if you are about to declare war on someone you're not allowed to)."
 gryphianhost.132.a:0 "Hail the Emperor!"
 gryphianhost.133.t:0 "The Emperor's Scorn"
 gryphianhost.133.d:0 "Sadly, the Emperor has expressed no interest in restoring our status as a border march. It seems he does not care about us, or about the riverland anymore."
 gryphianhost.133.a:0 "How unfortunate."
 gryphianhost.134.t:0 "The Darts Of Fate"
 gryphianhost.134.d:0 "Alas! While being carried by his soldiers during a celebration after their recent raid, Hetman Bulba was shot by a Communist sharpshooter! A dozen Cossacks immediately apprehended the villain and tore him to shreds on the spot, unable to contain their sheer fury, but the damage has been done. The Hetman died instantly, the musket-ball passing cleanly through his brain. His death has killed the normally-joyful mood of victorious warriors, and the raiding party has borne his body home in the old custom, carried on the shoulders of his most devoted warriors. Hetman Bulba led us for over forty years, and he was highly-regarded by all. Worse, he died without leaving a clear heir, meaning that the election of the next Hetman is bound to be fraught with turmoil."
 gryphianhost.134.a:0 "Today we mourn, tomorrow we shall begin anew."
 gryphianhost.135.t:0 "The Darts Of Fate"
 gryphianhost.135.d:0 "Alas! While comforting some of the wounded warriors of his band, despondent after their failed raid, Hetman Bulba was shot by a Communist sharpshooter! A dozen Cossacks immediately apprehended the villain and tore him to shreds on the spot, unable to contain their sheer fury, but the damage has been done. The Hetman died instantly, the musket-ball passing cleanly through his brain. His death has been the last and greatest tragedy on this failed excursion, and the raiding party has borne his body home in the old custom, carried on the shoulders of his most devoted warriors. Hetman Bulba led us for over forty years, and he was highly-regarded by all. However, without the funding that was intended to come from this raid, it is doubtful whether the country will be able to prevent itself from devolving into anarchy and turmoil. Hetman Bulba was the last thread holding together this fractured society, and now that thread has snapped. Anarchy is loose, and the most organised and violent party will win the day."
 gryphianhost.135.a:0 "Today we mourn, tomorrow we shall begin anew."
 gryphianhost.136.t:0 "Relighting The Flame"
 gryphianhost.136.d:0 "Now that we have liberated the workers of Prywhen from their bourgeois oppressors, we have decided to re-establish the Griffon Liberation Army, in order to more effectively adminster the land, as well as in acknowledgement of the debt that we owe to the Prywhen revolutionary movement for their aid in sponsoring and partially fighting our revolution. However, some within the Politburo debate whether it is wise to give Redglad and his fellows true power, or if it would be more advisable to give them merely symbolic roles, while retaining true control of the country ourselves."
 gryphianhost.136.a:0 "The area is still unstable. It would be best if we administered it directly"
 gryphianhost.136.b:0 "Nonsense! Prywhen and Kaiv are comrades and equals!"
 gryphianhost.137.t:0 "Restoration of the Crown"
 gryphianhost.137.d:0 "Now that we have seized the lands of Brodfeld, it has become clear to us that administering them directly would be a costly and painful affair. Many of the nobles have suggested re-establishing the Kingdom of Brodfeld, as the people would be more likely to respond well to a native ruler, however unpopular he was. Of course, how much actual power said King would have would be entirely at our discretion..."
 gryphianhost.137.a:0 "Put a puppet on the throne - a Kissau, if you can find one"

 EAW_WS_GRY_desc:0 "Founded centuries ago in revolt against subjugation by the Principality of Lake City, the griffons of Zapzhia live as their fathers have for generations, launching lightning raids against their neighbours to enrich their coffers. In the distant past, the Zapzhans changed their name to §YThe Gryphian Host.§! as part of an oath with Grover I of the Griffonian Empire, becoming his Border March.\n \nIn 1007, The Zaphzans have reached a turning point. Hetman Calas Bulba, a stabilising force for the last forty years, is old, though hearty. The ancient semi-feudal system is creaking and groaning, as the peasants gradually become less satisfied with being tied down to their lords' land, and ethnic divisions split the nation. Most pressingly, the Host's treasury is §Rrunning dry.§! This is doubly serious because of the presence of §RCommunist Revolutionaries§!, inspired and funded by the revolutionaries in Prywhen. Though they are not yet organised enough to overthrow the Hetmanate, they have many supporters throughout the countryside, and even among the army. If §Ythe upcoming raids for plunder were to fail§!, then dissent within the nation would likely rise high enough for them to sieze power.\n \nEven if nothing of the sort happens, Bulba is old, and unlikely to live for much longer. People already talk of successors, and right now the two most promising candidates are §YBorad Grifnitsky§!, whose §YViskyo Griffonskoe§! party has grown thanks to his great oratorical skills and charismatic personality, and §YYevin Krawvelets§!, who, despite having a blood relation to Hetman Bulba, is widely disliked for his cronyism and violent tendencies.\n \nOnly time will tell what fate awaits the Riverbank Griffons..."

 GRY_LUS_is_communist:0 "The Griffons of Lushi have overthrown their reactionary oppressors and embraced the glory of Communism! We should open diplomatic links with them, to better safeguard the Revolution from foreign threats - after all, do we not have a duty to defend our comrades?"
 GRY_LUS_not_communist:0 "The fire of Revolution has been lit in Griffonia, and it must spread! The fair people of Lushland have been crushed for too long under the oppression of reactionary governments, and we can no longer tolerate such injustice. The jungles of Lushland will catch aflame, and they will burn down the castles of the tyrants!"
 GRY_GRU_is_communist:0 "The red banner flies over Gryphus! Our ancestral brothers down South have embraced a socialist government, throwing off their old, bourgeouis rulers. In the interests of brotherhood and socialist camaraderie, we should send a diplomatic party to discuss closer ties between our peoples."
 GRY_GRU_not_communist:0 "Gryphus has long been ruled over by reactionary and bourgeouis governments. Can we rest idly by as our ancestral brothers lie in their chains? We will bring liberty to the oppressed workers of Gryphus!"
 GRY_GRW_is_communist:0 "Befriend The GLA"
 GRY_GRW_is_communist_desc:0 "Now that our Revolution here in Gryphia has succeeded, we must join with our brothers and generous benefactors in Prywhen. All socialists of the world must unite, for only together can we destroy capitalism!"
 GRY_GRW_not_communist:0 "Restore The Revolution"
 GRY_GRW_not_communist_desc:0 "Disaster! The Revolution in Prywhen has been snuffed out by reactionary forces! We owe our very existence to our comrades from Prywhen, can we simply sit by and allow the flame of socialism to be snuffed out at its very heart? No! Death to the reactionaries! Glory to the working class!"
 NIM_leave:0 "Nimbusia is abhorred by the mere suggestion that we would allow Griffons, the very reason for the existence of the Coalition, to join our alliance! They have made it very clear that they will break all relations with us if we dare to do something so foolish.\n"
 NIM_no_leave:0 "Despite their objections, it is clear that the Nimbusians will not go so far as to tear apart the Coalition over this issue, though it will hurt our standing with the other members of the Coalition.\n"
 WIT_leave:0 "Honoria has returned our envoy's letter, with a dagger driven through it. She will absolutely not tolerate the slightest suggestion of allowing Griffons to join the Coalition. If we dare to attempt such a thing, she would likely declare Wittenland independent from the Coalition.\n"
 WIT_no_leave:0 "The Wittenlanders have objected to the notion of allowing the Gryphians to join the Coalition, but it seems that they have a somewhat higher opinion of Grifnitsky, the new Hetman. They will probably not leave the Coalition over this matter, though it will damage our standing in the eyes of the other Coalition members.\n"
 LCT_leave:0 "Lake City is absolutely outraged at the very notion of forgiving the Gryphians - they're the very reason for the existence of the River Coalition! Local populist leaders have spent many days huffing and puffing about "weak Easterners" who "don't know what we've given up to protect them". If we were to try to force this through, the people of Lake City would certainly not be with us.\n"
 LCT_no_leave:0 "Wavebreaker has voiced concern over the notion of allowing the Gryphians to join the Coalition, but has stopped short of promising to block the motion absolutely. We could probably push the motion through without angering the people of Lake City too much, but it would hurt our standing in the eyes of the other Coalition members.\n"
 ally_with_BRF:0 "Cossack and Cannon"
 ally_with_BRF_desc:0 "While we have not always had the best relationship with the griffons of Brodfeld in the past, it has become clear that the Evi River Basin is no longer a safe place for small nations like ours. We will work to overcome our mutual dislike of each other, and invite the ruler of Brodfeld to our defense pact."
 ally_with_GRW:0 "Swallow Our Pride"
 ally_with_GRW_desc:0 "As much as it is distasteful for many of us, the griffons of Prywhen need to be included in our defence treaty as well. Let bygones be bygones, as our survival is more important than ideological differences."

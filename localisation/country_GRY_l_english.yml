### National Focuses ###
 GRY_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "For centuries, the Cossacks of the Gryphian Host have plied the plains of the Evya River Basin, farming, flying, fighting, and looting to make their living. Once an ancient border march of the Griffonian Empire, they have become famous as the terror of riverponies and a protector of Griffons - though they have occasionally "slipped" and stolen from their charges. Now, in 1007, the Host faces rapidly dwindling coffers. A raid must be launched to make up for this deficit - but the world is far more dangerous than it used to be. Communists agitate in the countryside, secret societies meet in the shadows. If the upcoming raid were to go wrong, chaos would ensue..."
 GRY_raid_brodfeld:0 "Raid Brodfeld"
 GRY_raid_brodfeld_desc:0 "Normally, it would be against our pact with the Griffonian Emperor to raid Brodfeld. However, central authority has crumbled in recent decades, and no Imperial Official has appeared to demand tribute or renewal of our oaths in over a decade. It is safe to assume that the Emperor will not stop us from taking advantage of Brodfeld's instability to line our pockets..."
 GRY_raid_radicals:0 "Raid The GLA"
 GRY_raid_radicals_desc:0 "Ordinarily, we're not supposed to raid anyone west of the river, but surely that doesn't apply to vicious, anti-monarchist radicals? Besides, this "Communism" thing is appealing to an unsettling number of our youth, and it would be good to damage them however we can."
 GRY_prywhen_response:0 "The Red Menace"
 GRY_prywhen_response_desc:0 "The GLA have managed to defeat the King of Brodfeld! This is a terrible threat, for they will surely turn their attention to us soon. We have to do something!"

 GRY_young_socialists_desc:0 "In the chaos of the Hetman's death, with the nobles falling out with each other over the lack of loot and blaming each other for Bulba's death, the GLA-supported 'Young Socialist Army' has seized control of the government. They have announced various reforms, intended to transition our society to a proper, Communist utopia."
 GRY_centralise:0 "The Struggle For Succession"
 GRY_centralise_desc:0 "With Hetman Bulba's death, the country has fallen into disarray. Many candidates vie for the title of Hetman, but two are emerging as clear frontrunners - Grifnitsky with his supporters in the Viskyo Griffonskoe, and Yeven Krawvelets, the old Hetman's great-nephew."
 GRY_chorna_rada:0 "Chyorna Rada"
 GRY_chorna_rada_desc:0 "Przekleństwo! The ideological conflict between the two candidates has provoked the Rada to greater than usual violence, and now their supporters are murdering each other on the streets of Kaiv. If we do not resolve the succession crisis quickly, Gryphia will fall into anarchy."

 GRY_liberate_gryphus_desc:0 "[Root.GRYcommGRU]"
 GRY_raid_season:0 "Gathering the Hosts"
 GRY_raid_season_desc:0 "The time has come to organise the yearly raid. \n\nHetman Calas Bulba has ordered the clan leaders to gather their warriors and assemble on the Brodfeldian border. Due to their ongoing civil war, they will be a good target for our raiders. Let's hope there is still something left to plunder."
 GRY_aftermath:0 "Raid's Aftermath"
 GRY_aftermath_desc:0 "We're awaiting the return of the raiding party. Hopefully they'll bring back an impressive haul." 
 GRY_rifle_stash:0 "Secret Stashes"
 GRY_rifle_stash_desc:0 "Some of our nobles have contributed their hoarded weapons stashes for the fight against the communist menace. We will overlook this undertaking for we will need every gun we can get."
 GRY_war_readiness:0 "Rally the Cossacks!"
 GRY_war_readiness_desc:0 "Every proud griffon who calls Gryphia their home must answer the call to arms, for they won't have one if the communists take over!" 
 GRY_rile_up_the_warriors:0 "Anti-Communist Propaganda"
 GRY_rile_up_the_warriors_desc:0 "Our fierce warriors are bloodthirsty and eager to fight. It will be a simple matter to incite them against the Prywhen threat, spreading tales of their renowned cruelty and malice."
 GRY_destroy_the_revolution:0 "End the Revolution!"
 GRY_destroy_the_revolution_desc:0 "It is time to restore the proper ruler to the west of the river Evya! The lands of Brodfeld will be free of tyranny!"
 GRY_kickstart_economy:0 "Modern Industrial Methods"
 GRY_kickstart_economy_desc:0 "Eastern Griffonia was never industrially developed compared to the western nations, yet Gryphia is more of an economic backwater compared to our closest neighbours. If we intend to survive in this dangerous world, we must bring the industrial revolution to Gryphia."
 GRY_agrarian_future:0 "Physiocracy"
 GRY_agrarian_future_desc:0 "Fiziokratiya is a philosophy from Aquileia which states that all wealth comes from nature - specifically agriculture. The lush Gryphian plains have always been rich with crops, and it is only natural that we adopt this way of thinking and improve our own fields."

 GRY_new_arsenals:0 "Firearms Workshops"
 GRY_new_arsenals_desc:0 "Historically, Gryphia has relied on guilds of blacksmiths and gunsmiths to produce weaponry for our armies. However, they cannot keep up with the increasing demands. Therefore, a set of workshops dedicated exclusively to weapon production will be built."
 GRY_better_tools:0 "Improved Mining Tools"
 GRY_better_tools_desc:0 "Our mining implements are primitive and crude. We must obtain new tools if we are to improve our resource acquisition."

 GRY_infrastructure:0 "Infrastructural Development"

 GRY_foreign_direct_investment:0 "Attract Foreign Capital"

 GRY_factory_efficiency:0 "Increase Factory Productivity"
 GRY_factory_efficiency_desc:0 "The factory workers are unfamiliar with their new jobs, and as such, productivity is lacking. We will organise seminars to help our workers perform better."
 GRY_kaiv_uni:0 "Open the Kaiv University"

 GRY_solidarity:0 "Unite the Gryphian Tribes"
 GRY_solidarity_desc:0 "Many tribes of Gryphia still resist the new order and refuse to serve in our red army. If we teach them the benefits of communism, and perhaps offer them some incentives, they will see reason and join us in establishing the rule of the proletariat."
 GRY_land_reform_1:0 "Seize Noble Property"
 GRY_land_reform_1_desc:0 "The decadent nobles have done nothing but argue over petty differences and squander their wealth on frivolities. We will confiscate their vast estates and distribute them to our peasants, who are the true future of the state. \n\nThe nobles will undoubtedly be furious with this move, however..."
 GRY_first_universale:0 "Proclaim the Commune!"

 GRY_we_need_factories:0 "Factories for the People"
 GRY_we_need_factories_desc:0 "A socialist state cannot exist without a worker class, and we have very few factories to speak of. We must make every effort to construct factories for the people, so that everyone can have a stable employment and income."
 GRY_integrate_cossacks_into_red_army:0 "Red Cossacks"
 GRY_integrate_cossacks_into_red_army_desc:0 "Despite their counter-revolutionary thinking, the old guard is still experienced in the art of war. We will indoctrinate them to our cause and show them why they should fight for the proletariat."
 GRY_ideological_purity_in_the_army:0 "Rozkozachennya"
 GRY_ideological_purity_in_the_army_desc:0 "The conservative ideas cannot be allowed to exist in the army! If we let them be, they'll spread their poisonous ideology and cause a mutiny! We will remove anyone who disagrees with the communist teachings!"

 GRY_land_reform_2_desc:0 "We have successfully stripped the former nobility of their unjust rights and privileges, and now they are equal, like everyone else. With their power base evaporated and the loss of their loyal soldiers, the former nobles are no longer a threat to the Kaiv Commune."
 GRY_second_universale:0 "Proclaim Our Foreign Policy"
 GRY_second_universale_desc:0 "Now that we have reorganised our state in the proper socialist fashion, it is time to decide how to treat our neighbours at large. Our hardliner faction believes that we should follow our comrades in Prywhen, but the more independently minded members of the party think we should forge our own path. Comrade Khurshevich has the final say in the matter, however."
 GRY_spread_the_revolution:0 "Revolution Without Borders"
 GRY_spread_the_revolution_desc:0 "While we are very grateful to our benefactors from Prywhen, they do not see that the revolution must be spread to our neighbours, by peaceful change or forced conversion. The oppressed workers will be free!"

 GRY_wittenland_attack_desc:0 "[Root.WIT_attack_text_desc]"
 GRY_wittenland_attackit:0 "Our Ancient Enemy"
 GRY_wittenland_attackit_desc:0 "The unicorns of Wittenland are nothing but a bourgeois menace, leeching upon the hard work of their proletariat. The time has come to end their endless partying and exploitation." 
 GRY_ask_GRW:0 "Petition Prywhen"
 GRY_ask_GRW_desc:0 "Wittenland is a land that has been constantly oppressed by reactionaries - but unfortunately, they are well protected by the River Coalition. With the assistance of our allies, we will have a much better chance at defeating them, but they may prove reluctant to go to war against the entire Coalition..."
 GRY_wittenland_makefriends:0 "Reach Out To Volaire"
 GRY_wittenland_makefriends_desc:0 "Glorious news! The proletariat in Wittenland have overthrown their aristocratic repressors and established a socialist state! Though we have some minor doctrinal differences with them, it would be foolish not to extend the hand of friendship to fellow leftists, to ensure the protection of the Revolution in both countries."
 GRY_red_education:0 "Socialist Learning"
 GRY_red_education_desc:0 "Education has improved much since recently, but we need to introduce mandatory curriculum to teach the new generations the value of socialism. They will be the young pioneers of the new Gryphia."

 GRY_GRW_army_experience_desc:0 "A series of mutual military exercises and war games will be organised to drill our armies. By working together, we will expand our pool of tactics and learn more about modern warfare. The common soldier will also become more dedicated to his comrades-in-arms as well."
 GRY_import_teachers:0 "Invite Educators from Prywhen"
 GRY_import_teachers_desc:0 "Up until recently, the griffons of Prywhen were as uneducated as ours. But the success of the revolution is apparent, and their people are now at the vanguard of socialist thinking. We should request their finest educators to spread the knowledge in Gryphia."
 GRY_brothers_in_revolution:0 "Gryphian-Prywhen Friendship"
 GRY_brothers_in_revolution_desc:0 "The People's Republic of Prywhen is a true friend of the Gryphian people, as they have shared much of their success with us! Long live the Gryphian-Prywhen friendship!"

 GRY_socialist_future_desc:0 "At long last we have completed the transition to a socialist state! The workers of Gryphia are well educated, well paid and have their employment secured. This is truly a victory of Comrade Khurshevich and the Kaiv Commune!"
 GRY_volnoye:0 "Support for Borad Grifnitsky"
 GRY_volnoye_desc:0 "Borad Grifnitsky, son of a minor noble, has been making great strides in support of Harmony among the people of Gryphia and even some other nobles. He believes that by changing our ways for the better, we can become more wealthy and developed. Many in the Rada don't quite agree with such radical changes, but they'd rather have him over Yeven..."
 GRY_monarchy_compromise:0 "A Revised Monarchy"
 GRY_monarchy_compromise_desc:0 "Despite Black Cloak machinations, the Rada has chosen Borad Grifnitsky for Hetman with a comfortable majority. The price of such, however, was that the nobles wouldn't support some of his more sweeping reforms. A compromise is in order."
 GRY_elected_hetman:0 "Let the People Decide"
 GRY_elected_hetman_desc:0 "Yeven and his lackeys have attempted to seize the Rada by force! Fortunately, their low numbers and a passionate speech by our new Hetman made them stand down, either out of shame or pragmatism. As his first act, Borad has ordered to organise an election in which every griffon can vote. He believes that this will show to all the naysayers that the Harmony works."
 GRY_reform_starshina:0 "New Senior Staff"
 GRY_reform_starshina_desc:0 "The high command has grown complacent and unsuited for the threats that challenge our Harmony. New, fresh faces will be hired."
 GRY_form_government:0 "Appoint the New Government"
 GRY_form_government_desc:0 "Hetman Bulba has left little in the way of actual governance, due to his habit of trying to solve most issues by himself. While his competence was not in question, his absence left us without a guiding figure. New ministers and cabinet shall be formed to prevent such from occuring again."
 GRY_strengthen_cossack_radas:0 "Increase Tribal Autonomy"
 GRY_strengthen_cossack_radas_desc:0 "It seems that recent events have divided our nation, more so than usual. Hetman Borad believes that the first step towards a united Gryphia is by giving each clan a proper representation."
 GRY_placate_communists:0 "Concessions to the Communists"
 GRY_placate_communists_desc:0 "GSDLR has some good ideas for improving the life of the common griffon. In exchange for ceasing all subversive activities, Cornilov Khurshevich will be invited to our new government to enact some socialist reforms (within reason, of course)."

 GRY_give_land_to_the_people:0 "Land for the Impoverished"
 GRY_give_land_to_the_people_desc:0 "Most of the people in Gryphia live in abject poverty, having barely any property in their possessions. With land being the most important thing a Gryphian can have, it seems only right we purchase excess noble lands and distribute them fairly to the commonfolk."
 GRY_placate_clans:0 "Tribal Benefits"
 GRY_placate_clans_desc:0 "Our initial efforts have given results, and the clans are slowly drifting towards complete unification. A few more reforms and benefits will convince the most stubborn and independently minded clans."
 GRY_minorities_in_army:0 "Integrate the Clans"
 GRY_minorities_in_army_desc:0 "Every clan's banner now stands under the proud insignia of the united Gryphia! As such, the most successful and influential griffons have offered their pledge, sworn to protect our Harmony."
 GRY_admin_reform:0 "Bureaucratic Reforms"

 GRY_compromise_with_rich:0 "Resolve the Noble Concerns"
 GRY_compromise_with_rich_desc:0 "The nobles are concerned with our reforms, especially with our purchase of their land. As they are still influential and powerful, we need to settle a compromise, unless we want a rebellion on our claws..."
 GRY_education_reform:0 "Begin the Education Reform"
 GRY_education_reform_desc:0 "Education in Gryphia has long been the exclusive domain of the wealthy and powerful. This cannot be allowed to continue. Naturally, this will require us to build many new school buildings and hire educators from abroad the country. Mandatory school enrollment will be enacted for basic education, at least."
 GRY_reinforce_government:0 "Strong Harmonic Government"
 GRY_reinforce_government_desc:0 "The commonfolk of Gryphia are very satisfied with our reforms, and even the nobles, communists and leftovers of the old regimes can't say too many bad things about us. Harmony has taken roots in our land."

 GRY_new_diplomacy:0 "Contemporary Diplomacy"
 GRY_new_diplomacy_desc:0 "We've been isolated from the outside for a long time¸ being a nation of savage raiders. We need to show the world that we've turned over a new leaf, and gain trusted allies."
 GRY_apply_to_RIV:0 "Approach the Riverponies"
 GRY_apply_to_RIV_desc:0 "Even the most optimistic believe this to be a fruitless effort, but Hetman Borad insists we must establish a formal alliance with the Riverponies.

 GRY_federal_investment:0 "Riverpony Investment Program"
 GRY_federal_investment_desc:0 "The impossible has happened! Not only has Hetman Borad returned with positive news, the Riverponies have agreed to invest in our nation! A few investors have already offered to fund the construction of new roads and factories. It will be a tale of the ages, of how Hetman Borad has sown the seed of friendship between griffons and ponies."
 GRY_RIV_defense_coordination:0 "Joint Military Cooperation"

 GRY_the_between_rivers_concept:0 "Approach Our Griffon Neighbours"
 GRY_the_between_rivers_concept_desc:0 "Unfortunately, the stark differences between the ponies and us are too vast to overcome, not to mention the centuries of enmity. We will look for allies in our own kin."

 GRY_true_hetman:0 "Support for Yeven Krawvelets"
 GRY_true_hetman_desc:0 "Yeven Krawvelets, the last Hetman's grandnephew, is the right choice for our leader. With the backing of wealthy landowners, he will convince the squabbling Rada that only he can bring Gryphia to new glories."
 GRY_proclaim_new_hetmanate:0 "The Rightful Heir"
 GRY_proclaim_new_hetmanate_desc:0 "The Rada has, with a tense majority, chosen Yeven Krawvelets for Hetman. The opposition are disgusted, but their opinion is irrelevant now."
 GRY_prevent_ruina:0 "Stop the Ruïna"
 GRY_prevent_ruina_desc:0 "Traitors! Grifnitsky's supporters have stormed out from the Rada during Yeven's inauguration and have sworn to oppose his rightful rule! Right now, as we speak, they are arming themselves to seize the title of Hetman by force. Though they will not be strong enough to make full-fledged war against us, we are in for months of civil strife. We must stop the Ruïna!"
 GRY_support_of_kosh_otamans:0 "Kosh Otaman Support"
 GRY_support_of_kosh_otamans_desc:0 "The Kosh Otamans, our high ranking officers, have decided to throw their support behind Yeven. They have reached the conclusion that he is more likely to grant them new privileges unlike Grifnitsky."

 GRY_pokozachennya_desc:0 "Pokozachennya, or the act of becoming a Cossack, is an ancient ceremony in which an aspiring Cossack was given his shablya and finery, and formally inducted. Today however, we cannot abide by their rigorous requirements, and we must cut the frivolities off, for we require every griffon for our cause."
 GRY_visit_the_people:0 "Public Support for Yeven"
 GRY_visit_the_people_desc:0 "Yeven's rule has already been contested by the nobles, and his popularity is very weak. He has decided that the best course of action is to seek support in the commonfolk, explaining to them that he is saving Gryphia, unlike the treasonous Harmonic supporters."
 GRY_crush_dissent:0 "Eliminate Every Dissenter"
 GRY_crush_dissent_desc:0 "Despite our gentle approach, many of the populace are still unconvinced that Yeven is bringing a positive change. We will have to deal with them, one way or another, before they decide to take up arms and join the rebels."
 GRY_deal_with_traitors:0 "Purge Communist Scum"
 GRY_deal_with_traitors_desc:0 "The GSDLR are nothing but Prywhenist agitators, sent to undermine the Gryphian nation!

 GRY_church_support:0 "Allies Within the Temples"
 GRY_church_support_desc:0 "The common religion of the griffons is prevalent in Gryphia, but our religious leaders are not influential enough compared to the Imperial Heartlands.

 GRY_every_griffon_a_cossack:0 "Extend the Pokozachennya"
 GRY_every_griffon_a_cossack_desc:0 "Our neverending need for more soldiers requires us to loosen the pokozachennya rites even more. The new recruits might not have the training of the Cossacks of old, but they make up for it with their enthusiasm and fervour."

 GRY_unite_zavs:0 "United Zaphzian Tribes"
 GRY_unite_zavs_desc:0 "The independence of the clans is starting to become a nuisance to our centralisation efforts. The clans of Zaphzia will be united as one, whether they like it or not."

 GRY_attack_brodfeld:0 "Crossing The Evya"
 GRY_attack_brodfeld_desc:0 "For centuries, our ancient compact with the Griffonian Emperor forbade us from crossing the River Evya with an army, and for centuries those fat, lazy nobles in Brodfeld grew rich off of the safety we provided for them. Yeven has decided that enough is enough! We will take repayment for our centuries of service, by taking the riches of Brodfeld for ourselves!"
 GRY_revenge_on_LCT:0 "Jezergrad Will Burn!"
 GRY_revenge_on_LCT_desc:0 "The sneering, vicious ponies of Lake City have been a thorn in our side since ages past. Now that our power has reached its zenith, the time has come to burn Jezergrad to the ground and scatter the ponies once and for all! This is our revenge!"

 GRY_cossack_reform:0 "A Contemporary Cossack"
 GRY_cossack_reform_desc:0 "Since the days of old, a Gryphian Cossack was a feared sight on the battlefield. Their skill with a shablya was unmatched, their musket aim impeccable, their speed - an unstoppable force across the plains and skies. But technology has advanced, and our raiding strategies are not as effective as they used to be. The Cossack must adapt to the world of today."
 GRY_grand_battleplan_focus:0 "Grandiozniy Plan Bytvy Doctrine"
 GRY_grand_battleplan_focus_desc:0 "Our reckless, impetuous behaviour must be abandoned in favour of extensive planning, proper fortifications and containing the enemy. Gryphian lives shouldn't be thrown away, after all."
 GRY_the_trenchers:0 "Trench Warfare"
 GRY_the_trenchers_desc:0 "Normally, our plains make for a poor defensive location, but we can turn them into the fields of death with trenches, minefields and artillery barrages. We shall establish a specialized corps for this purpose."
 GRY_adapt_to_mountain_warfare:0 "Lessons of the Vuiky Tribe"
 GRY_adapt_to_mountain_warfare_desc:0 "The Vuiky tribe was always an oddball among the hosts, preferring to live in the hills. However, they always excelled during the raids in the mountains of Wittenland. We shall adopt their tactics to train specialised troops."
 GRY_mass_assault_focus:0 "Massoviy Napad Doctrine"

 GRY_the_cossack_idea:0 "The Cossack Spirit"
 GRY_the_cossack_idea_desc:0 "There were few things more terrifying for a pony than a Cossack aimed at claiming their livestock and life. Clearly, having more Cossacks will strike fear in our foes, so we will loosen the requirements for becoming one."
 GRY_precious_life:0 "Help the Wounded"
 GRY_precious_life_desc:0 "Medicine has always been primitive in Gryphia, and as a result, many wounded soldiers either died or became crippled. This trend will be reversed with the forming of a professional medical corps."
 GRY_guns_for_the_cossacks:0 "Improved Firearms"
 GRY_guns_for_the_cossacks_desc:0 "Much of our weaponry is outdated and useless against the new threats on the battlefield. We must look into procuring new weapon models and blueprints."
 GRY_new_signals:0 "Electronic Innovations"

 GRY_superior_firepower_focus:0 "Perevazhna Vogneva Mits' Doctrine"
 GRY_superior_firepower_focus_desc:0 "A Cossack is no coward, but even they don't subject himself to unnecessary risks. Why not simply blast our enemies to dirt with overwhelming artillery barrage and swoop in afterward?"
 GRY_purchase_bigger_guns:0 "Artillery from the Heartlands"
 GRY_purchase_bigger_guns_desc:0 "Our quartermasters have inspected our artillery stocks, and most of them are either broken down or hopelessly outdated. However, Boreas smiles on us.

 GRY_the_future:0 "Cossacks on Wheels"
 GRY_the_future_desc:0 "Some of the nobles have expressed interest in a new invention from the Heartlands called "tank". They lack the class and finesse of our Cossacks, but undoubtedly they provide an excellent protection and assault options for our soldiers."
 GRY_final_reform:0 "A New Age for the Cossacks"
 GRY_final_reform_desc:0 "Some of our people mourn the displacement of our traditions, but the Cossacks of the new age are the leading force on the battlefield once again."
 GRY_navy:0 "Raiders on the High Seas"
 GRY_navy_desc:0 "Some of our soldiers see the sea for the first time and they are mystified. The sea looks like a vast plain, and surely that means we can conduct raids on them as well, can't we...?"
 GRY_naval_company:0 "Offer We Can't Refuse"
 GRY_naval_company_desc:0 "A group of griffons from Skyfall have offered to share their naval expertise and designs for a decent price. We shall take their offer, and have them lead our newly established naval company."

 GRY_submarines:0 "Underwater Cossacks"
 GRY_submarines_desc:0 "The submarine is one of the most subtle weapons in war, their torpedoes being able to sink most of the ships with ease. However, we must watch out for enemy destroyers and radar stations."
 GRY_marine_focus:0 "Form the Morska Pihota"
 GRY_marine_focus_desc:0 "One of our advisors has had an idea: pick some of our best infantry and adapt them for naval travels. That way, we shall have a mobile unit which we can transport by the sea. They will be the vanguard of our landing operations."
 GRY_aegland_oil:0 "Black Gold"
 GRY_aegland_oil_desc:0 "Oil is a common resource in Gryphia, but we've not been aware of its true uses up until now. Current oil fields will be expanded and prospectors will be sent to search for new ones, so that we may have plenty for our vehicles, ships and planes."

 GRY_air_company:0 "Antoninov Aerotech"

 GRY_cossacks_are_naturals:0 "Paratrooper Training"
 GRY_cossacks_are_naturals_desc:0 "Cossacks are no strangers to carrying a heavy load on their backs, but they can't do it while flying at the same time. With the ingenious parachute however, they can deploy behind enemy lines fully equipped and with a factor of surprise to them."
 GRY_better_radars:0 "Increasing Our Gaze"

 GRY_fearless_peerless:0 "Bezstrashni Piloty"
 GRY_fearless_peerless_desc:0 "Some of our pilots are eager enough, or perhaps desperate, to give themselves in for glory and an honourable death in combat with the enemy. We will allow this, despite the protests of our more careful commanders. Planes are cheap, after all."
 GRY_ride_the_wind:0 "Blyskavychniy"
 GRY_ride_the_wind_desc:0 "The jet engine is the future of air warfare! With it, the Sky Cossacks will truly become uncatchable!"

 GRY_empty_the_prisons:0 "Conscript Criminals"
 GRY_empty_the_prisons_desc:0 "It is sad we must rely on the worst dregs of our society to liberate our people from the communist oppression, but undoubtedly, they are worse. At the very least, the jailed griffons are already familiar with the bloodshed."

 GRY_hire_foreign_instructors:0 "Import Foreign Researchers"
 GRY_hire_foreign_instructors_desc:0 "As if Gryphia wasn't lacking in educated griffons already, the recent instability has caused almost all of them to flee elsewhere. We are forced to seek out exterior knowledge, thus, we shall hire researchers from foreign lands."

 GRY_crush_communism_desc:0 "The communist supporters may have had some good ideas for the people of Gryphia, but they have irrevocably stained their reputation with their 'reforms', not to mention they had a part in murdering Hetman Bulba. Maar take them! They will plague Gryphia no more!"
 GRY_betray_black_cloaks:0 "Dispose of the Black Cloaks"
 GRY_betray_black_cloaks_desc:0 "Black Cloaks have aided us against the communists, but now, their usefulness has come to an end. They must be stopped before their radical ideas bring the nation to another Ruïna."

 GRY_the_hetman_alone:0 "Absolute Rule"
 GRY_the_hetman_alone_desc:0 "Recent events has shown that toying with all these new ideologies and different rulership forms has brought us nothing good. We will simply continue electing our leaders by the Rada, as we always did."

 GRY_imperial_funding:0 "Funding from the Empire"
 GRY_imperial_funding_desc:0 "Praise Boreas! The Empire has agreed to renew our deal, and now, an influx of various goods is entering Gryphia, making our people much happier.

 GRY_remain_independent:0 "Stronger Alone"

 GRY_secure_safety_desc:0 "Though Borad wishes for the Zaphzan people to live peacefully alongside its neighbors, some of those neighbours cannot be reasoned with. The courageous Cossack people are more than willing to use force to break the backs of all who would subjugate them."
 GRY_stop_GRW:0 "The Red Threat"
 GRY_stop_GRW_desc:0 "The revolutionaries in Prywhen do not understand the importance of our traditions, nor do they respect the sovereignty of "reactionary" countries, regardless of how well they treat their people or how much their people want them. They have already sent agitators into our country, and it is surely only a matter of time before they attack us! We must defang them before they bite us!"
 GRY_stop_WNG:0 "Don't Step On The Cossacks"
 GRY_stop_WNG_desc:0 "Wingbardy was a distant tale to us, a strange place that youngsters occasionally went for education, and little more. Recently, however, Wingbardy's new government has gone on the warpath, and has conquered so far that they have encroached upon our borders. Seeing the bloody swath they've carved towards us, it would be folly to think they will stop here! We must smash their power, before it is too late!"
 GRY_stop_LCT:0 "Ancient Hatred"
 GRY_stop_LCT_desc:0 "It is perhaps understandable that the ponies of Lake City have become bloodcrazed, having suffered our raids for centuries. Though we have sworn to stop raiding under Borad's government, they do not believe us, and now they have adopted a radically militaristic government. We are the natural first targets of their hatred, and so we must take steps to protect ourselves before they crush us."

 GRY_tech_for_manpower:0 "Griffons for Technology"
 GRY_tech_for_manpower_desc:0 "We've ascertained that our overlord is willing to trade rifles for soldiers, making it only senseful that expand this makeshift trading to include scientists. The technological development of the region is staggeringly poor."

 GRY_invite_krahstahl:0 "Invite Imperial Companies"
 GRY_invite_krahstahl_desc:0 "The Gryphian attempts at modernisation have been crude and inefficient. This is most noticeable in their steel production, which is brittle and made in meagre quantities. Fortunately, there are plenty of Imperial conglomerates who'd love to step in and take over."
 GRY_greatest_asset:0 "Fuel for the War Machines"
 GRY_greatest_asset_desc:0 "Undoubtedly, the greatest Zaphzan asset are their vast quantities of oil. It even flows freely from the ground! The Lord Protector has specified oil as the most important resource and we must do everything to keep its production high."

 gryphianhost.103.d:0 "In its first official Universale, the Central Rada of the Gryphian Hetmanate has formally declared the dissolution of the old form of government, and has proclaimed that, forthwith, the people of Gryphus are governed by the Kaiv Commune, a proletarian government by the people, and for the people."
 gryphianhost.103.a:0 "The way of the future!"
 gryphianhost.104.t:0 "The Kaiv Commune reaches out in proletarian solidarity"
 gryphianhost.104.d:0 "The griffons of the Gryphian Host have overthrown their reactionary government, and wish to ally with us in a display of socialist brotherhood! How should we respond?"
 gryphianhost.104.a:0 "We warmly welcome our new comrades!"
 gryphianhost.104.b:0 "They are revisionists - we cannot risk our revolution by associating with them."
 gryphianhost.105.t:0 "A Shocking Proposal"
 gryphianhost.105.d:0 "[Root.GetLeader] has today received an astonishing proposal - so astonishing in fact that it was initially assumed to be a prank. However, we have been assured that, no, the Gryphian Host really does want to join our alliance. Their leader, Borad Grifnitsky, claims to be devoted to harmony, and that his people have turned over a new leaf. Most ponies are skeptical, but some are urging that it might be worth a try - after all, if they renege on their promise, we can always just kick them out again, right? Most Coalition members don't have a particularly strong opinion on this matter, except for three. Lake City and Wittenland are the Gryphians' traditional raid targets and have suffered greatly. The public in these places will be highly resistant to change on this issue. Nimbusia, on the other hand, is far from the Griffons, but regards itself as the protector of all Riverponies, and will not support any action that seems to threaten the safety of the Riverlands. We have sent envoys to each member, and their responses have just returned -\n[Root.NIMreaction] [Root.LCTreaction] [Root.WITreaction]."
 gryphianhost.105.a:0 "If they're both alright with it, then I suppose we can let them in, but keep an eye on them!"

 gryphianhost.106.t:0 "Old Wounds Forgiven"
 gryphianhost.106.d:0 "To our great surprise and joy, the Riverponies have seen past the actions of our ancestors, and have recognised our new, Harmonic society. We are now a full-fledged member of the River Coalition!"
 gryphianhost.106.a:0 "Excellent!"
 gryphianhost.107.t:0 "No Water Under That Bridge"
 gryphianhost.107.d:0 "Sadly, though not unexpectedly, the Riverponies have rejected our appeal. We cannot look to them for protection, friendship, or security."
 gryphianhost.107.a:0 "We can't say we really blame them."
 gryphianhost.108.t:0 "A Great Change - If It's Real"
 gryphianhost.108.d:0 "In a shocking twist, our ancient enemies, the Gryphian Host, recently applied for membership in the River Coalition - and the River Republic agreed! Though this has evoked protests from many of our citizens, the Gryphians really do seem to have changed, and [Root.GetLeader] assures the people that everything will be alright, and that the Gryphians will be booted back out at the first sign of trouble. While not everyone is happy with the situation, it seems as if they're putting up with it for the time being."

Tradition demanded that each of them were voted upon by the Rada, which resulted in much precious time lost as none had the required majority. This paralysis lasted for a fortnight, until the most viable candidates presented their claim.\n\nBorad Grifnitsky, backed by many of the impoverished peers, has captured the attention of many with his promises of reforms, peace and stability. Although many have accused him of being soft on the matters of defence, he has assured them that pacifism does not imply weakness for the Gryphians.

Although their existence could never be decisively proved, these whispers in the dark remained a concern for the gods-fearing griffons. However, something else was a far larger issue for the common griffon - worship of the Riverpony pantheon. Knowledge that somegriff was following pony spirits would result in nothing less than ostracism for them, and none were more scorned than the Polshava tribesgriffs, who lived for a long time under the rule of Jezeragrad.\n\nAs part of his national unification campaign, Borad Grifnitsky has made it personal goal to reach out and integrate this disdained tribe.

No, force, will and power is what gets the job done.\n\nAnd that's how Yeven made his approach at the Rada.

His only request was to demand a surrender before firing. After all, it would be bad to appear so eager to spill blood, when prisoners could be used in many productive ways.\n\nYeven's gambit paid off.

No, he had found a much more powerful base of supporters, who would assist in seeing his vision come to pass. The peasants and the growing urban population, alongside the growing armed forces who were loyal to him, and not their noble masters would be a useful tool for achieving greatness.\n\nAnd so the humble coronation event in Kaiv came to pass. It was not extravagant by any means - Yeven had no intention to show off wealth while the people lived with little. The ancient crown of the Gryphian Kings, however, was a bit too decadent for his tastes, but such was tradition, as it was placed on Yeven's scalp by the Prelate of Eviliana-in-Zaphzia.

 gryphianhost.154.a:0 "Zaphzia doesn't need a king."
 gryphianhost.155.t:0 "Our Rightful Land"
 gryphianhost.155.d:0 "[GRY.GetLeader]'s reforms have taken off to a great start. Finally, real industry had been built, the war-forges were busy producing many firearms for his growing army, and quality of life has been steadily increasing. Certainly, Gryphia couldn't solve its problems overnight, but they were on a good path to get things into order! With the populace satisfied, Yeven could now proceed with the next phase of his plan.\n\nWhich was a large scale public campaign to spread his idea of conquest. The griffons lapped up his speeches, where he spoke with great fervour how the neighbouring griffon nations had no right to exist outside of the Gryphian influence, and that they would provide with the necessary griffonpower and materiel for their revenge on the ponies.\n\nYeven's ploy was successful. Conscious objectors and pacifists were quickly swept away by the bloodthirsty majority who wanted to see the glory of Zaphzia restored."
 gryphianhost.155.a:0 "None may stand in our way."
 gryphianhost.156.t:0 "Worrisome Sabre-rattling"
 gryphianhost.156.d:0 "Our envoys and citizens abroad residing in the [GRY.GetNameDef] have returned recently with troubling portents - [GRY.GetLeader], who has recently assumed power, followed by a period of rapid industrialisation and military arm-up, is growing increasingly hostile. He has been noted speaking in public of the need to "unite old Zaphzan lands", which so happens to include our nation, by force of arms should we not submit to his will. We have no desire to submit to this petty tyrant, and while Gryphia has not presented substantial threat in the past years, the recent changes show that we do need to concern ourselves with the border defence."
 gryphianhost.156.a:0 "Let them come. They will fail."
 gryphianhost.157.t:0 "Young Socialist Takeover"
 gryphianhost.157.d:0 "The failed raid has had a terrible effect on Gryphia. With Hetman Bulba and most of the higher nobility slain on the field, combined with the lack of expected funding from the raid, the Zaphzan national unity has shattered. Attempts to convene the Rada have been unsuccessful, with many of the landowners engaging in small scale civil wars.\n\nSeeing their chance, the oppressed serfs have risen up, supported by the communist insurgents. The nobility was quickly pacified given their strength was wasted on infighting, and the takeover has proceeded at a quick pace. Khurshevich and his followers have already began implementing their reforms, with the commonfolk cheering at finally owning the land they've been toiling at for so long."
 gryphianhost.157.a:0 "The reactionaries cannot stop the revolution!"
 gryphianhost.158.t:0 "The Revolution Beyond Our Borders"
 gryphianhost.158.d:0 "With the second universale concluded, and the choice made to pursue territorial expansion as the nation's chief priority, [GRY.GetLeader] continued to stress the importance of liberating the oppressed workers who were trapped in the circle of exploitation, feudalism and disenfranchisement. Everygriffon, Cornilo spoke, deserves the right to a proper compensation for his labour, and the ownership of his tools of work, and the Kaiv Commune would see that the red flag of socialism would fly high, from the shores of Gryphus to the plains of Lushi. All this was needed before they could take on their ancient pony foes, who held even less respect for the values of communism."
 gryphianhost.158.a:0 "Workers, rise up!"
 gryphianhost.159.t:0 "Communist Provocations"
 gryphianhost.159.d:0 "The revolution and the bitter civil war which engulfed the nation of Brodfeld has had us worried that the red menace would come soon for us - and that just might come to us soon enough. Our infiltrators stationed in [GRY.GetName] speaks of a recent decision by the Kaivian Supreme Soviet, which was then printed and spread in the state newspaper, to spread communism across their borders, whether peacefully or by force. We cannot allow them to overthrow our legitimate rulers and replace them with unwashed peasants, we must prepare for war before it is too late!"
 gryphianhost.159.a:0 "Look to our defences!"
 gryphianhost.160.t:0 "Together In Solidarity"
 gryphianhost.160.d:0 "With the second universale concluded, and the choice made to conform to our larger partner to the west in Prywhen, [GRY.GetLeader] has assured the hardliner members of the Party that subservience did not mean that Kaiv would have no influence in the revolution. Instead, Cornilo spoke of his personal friendship with [GRW.GetLeader], and how he had made everything we have possible. The red flag will eventually fly over the decadent nations that surround us, but for now we will focus on strengthening ourselves in the preparation for such a task. We need only to be patient. "
 gryphianhost.160.a:0 "[GRW.GetLeader] knows best."
 gryphianhost.161.t:0 "[GRY.GetLeader] Assures Us Of His Support"
 gryphianhost.161.d:0 "A short notice from our comrades in Kaiv has arrived today - their recent supreme soviet has decided that it would conform to us in regards of foreign policy. [GRW.GetLeader] has expressed satisfaction at this turn of events, for their situation was still unstable and much more was needed to be done before socialism could be spread. This move will only serve to deepen the friendship between the griffons of Prywhen and Gryphia."
 gryphianhost.161.a:0 "True comrades, one and all."
 gryphianhost.162.t:0 "A Quiet Moment Together"
 gryphianhost.162.d:0 "[Root.gryphianhost162desc]"
 gryphianhost.162.a:0 "To friendship."
 gryphianhost.163.t:0 "Our Ancient Foe"
 gryphianhost.163.d:0 ""To arms! To arms! In the defence of our home!"\n\nThese words were chanted across every Zaphzan city. The griffons have eagerly accepted this call to arms, for no foe was more detestable than the ponies of Jezeragrad. War support had never been higher and even the children and elderly have pledged themselves to the cause. The Gryphians know what fate awaits them should the ponies be victorious, and they swore to fight on, to the bitter end."

He is held in high regard by almost everyone, both for his sage advice and for his surprising youthfulness and energy, considering his age.

Where Bulba was straightforward and honest, Yeven is loud-mouthed and fond of verbal abuse. Where Bulba was valiant, Yeven is violent. One thing he has got, however, is ambition - and lots of it. He dreams of restoring the Zaphzan people to ancient greatness, and is willing to use force to achieve his dream of a "Greater Zaphzia"."

Shortly before this, Cornilo left Prywhen to lead the resistance in his own home country. Now that he is in power, he will certainly seek out his old friend and align with him. He favors a policy of solidarity with Prywhen and caring for the vulnerable farming class as the way forward for Zaphzia."
 GRY_BORAD_DESC:0 "Borad Grifnitsky is an atypical cossack - though valiant in battle, he is not fond of violence and prefers to find peaceful, long-term solutions to serious problems where possible. In the warlike Cossack society this should have isolated and ostracised him, but a combination of battlefield valor, an amicable personality, and exceptional oratory has drawn a following to him nonetheless. Seeing the poor state of the Zapzhans, he desires to reform the Host into a democratic republic and diplomatically secure their people against reprisals from the Communists and the Riverponies."

However, now we face the very important issue of our foreign policy. While we are grateful to our friends in the People's Republic Of Prywhen, there is division among the Rada about how closely we should tie ourselves to them. The supporters of Khurshevich hold that it would be best to tie ourselves further to Prywhen, for the world is large and filled with people who hate us, and it would be foolish to strike out on our own and risk alienating our only reliable ally. However, his opponents have criticised this policy, calling it "revisionist" and claiming that Comrade Khurshevich simply lacks with courage to stand up to the forces of reaction."
 GRY_117_not_GRW_faction:0 "At last, we have finished stabilising our country, and established the beginnings of a true socialist state in Gryphia. However, now we face the very important issue of our foreign policy.

The brazen robbers have crossed into our territory and taken what they will, seizing gold, precious gems, guns, food, and anything of value. Our armies are too busy with the civil war to deal with them, and in any case their raiding parties are too fast for our armies to catch them most of the time. They have inflicted substantial economic damage to our country, and for the moment, there is nothing we can do about it."

The brazen robbers have crossed into our territory and attacked whomever they will. However, their raid seems to have been badly organised, with bands of raiders stumbling about in an uncoordinated manner, often poaching treasure from each other moreso than from our own people. On top of this, the peasants of Brodfeld are highly used to war by this point, and have picked up a few tricks that enable them to inflict some surprising defeats upon Cossack raiding parties. It seems that this attack has blown up in their own faces!"
 GRW_raided_success:0 "The reactionary Cossack regime of the Gryphian Host has rarely abided by their promise not to attack the griffons of Prywhen, and now they have proven their perfidy yet again. In a brazen and flagrantly illegal move, they have crossed the border into Prywhen and begun pillaging and killing as they will. What is worse, they seem to be specifically targeting Communists and known Communist sympathisers, and have even taken to raiding our weapon caches! This will harm our efforts to make war for the foreseeable future."

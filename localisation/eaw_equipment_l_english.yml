Their initial light tank design, the Breezie, was very fast, but poorly armed and armoured. Never intended for a full scale war, delays in its replacement and increasing border incursions led to it being refined and produced in larger than planned numbers."

 SIC_knights:0 "Rediarios"
 SIC_knights_desc:0 "Since the age of the ancient Karthin Empire, the griffons of Sicameon have prefered the Retiarii, fast and nimble fighters who ensnare their sword and shield wielding opponents with net and trident, rather than the feudalist symbol that is the Knight. Styled as the Rediarios in modern times, they trade their fishing fork and snare for the rifle, shovel, and camouflage net, vigilantly ready to quickly confront the enemy and stubbornly hold the line, figuratively ensnaring them with tricks, traps, and trenches and slaying those bogged down opponents with gunfire."
 SIC_tech_knights:0 "Retiarii Division I"
 SIC_tech_knights_desc:0 "Perhaps not known the world round but certainly feared by the knights of imperial Griffonia for their speed and cunning, the traditions of the retiarii are possibly even older than the knight, stemming from the ancient and humble fishergriff forced to fight. While not boasting the physical toughness of the knight, the retiarii boast great speed on the march, and can stubbornly dig themselves in to hold back even an armored assault."
 SIC_tech_knights2:0 "Retiarii Division II"
 SIC_tech_knights2_desc:0 "Through the use of improved training and equipment, we can strengthen our Retiarii Divisions."
 SIC_tech_knights_magical:0 "Professionalize the Retiarii"
 SIC_tech_knights_magical_desc:0 "Traditionally the retiarii have been an irregular force, acquiring their skills through their own experience and older fighters passing on their wisdom. Turning these great militia bands into even greater special forces units is only a natural evolution. Their lesser numbers also means we can provide them with more niche and experimental weapons and equipment."
 SIC_tech_knights_magical2:0 "The Griffons of Maritime Myth"
 SIC_tech_knights_magical2_desc:0 "No one less than the very most elite in both mental and physical prowess will be accepted to train and obtain the honored title of a Rediario, and through this these units will be feared as the stuff of legend, in the realm of sea monsters and Sycaecia herself."
 SIC_tech_knights_regular:0 "Maintain Egalitarian Standards"
 SIC_tech_knights_regular_desc:0 "The retiarii have always stood as a symbol of equality, that any common griffon can take up what arms they have and fight off any would be oppressor. To stratify our troops by imposing stricter standards would be blasphemous to what they stand for."
 SIC_tech_knights_regular2:0 "Legions of the Sea"
 SIC_tech_knights_regular2_desc:0 "Any griffon can attain the legendary title of Rediario if they train themselves hard enough and prove themselves in battle, and together they are like the great ocean waves combined with wit and soul: confounding and indefatigable. They are truly legions of the sea."
 SIC_tech_knights3:0 "Retiarii Division III"
 SIC_tech_knights3_desc:0 "With the further modernization and improvement of our retiarii, we can ensure their prevalence on the battlefield can continue."
 SIC_tech_knights_a:0 "Retiarii Division IV"
 SIC_tech_knights_a_desc:0 "By incorporating advances in magical and material armor protection, we can provide the retiarii a degree of protection unprecedented while maintaining their speed."
 SIC_tech_knights_b:0 "Retiarii Division V"
 SIC_tech_knights_b_desc:0 "In order to keep the retiarii competitive, we must ensure they have the finest in enchantments and equipment."
 SIC_tech_knights_c:0 "Retiarii Division VI"
 SIC_tech_knights_c_desc:0 "By harnessing all of our amassed technical and magical knowledge, we can equip the retiarii to be the finest fighters in the world, their wit and spirit unbound from the limitations of their equipment."

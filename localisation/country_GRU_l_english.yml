GRU_the_riaporto_congress:0 "The Riaportu Congress"
GRU_the_riaporto_congress_desc:0 "To break through the political stalemate plaguing the free towns of Gryphus, Chairgriffon de Viartorré has convened a great congress to be held in Riaportu. Representatives from all corners of Gryphus, from the Order of Opinicus to the Gryps-Süd GmbH are going to attend as we choose the future of our nation." 

GRU_the_economic_debate:0 "The Economic Debate"
GRU_the_economic_debate_desc:0 "To say that the economy of Gryphus has been focused on the coast is an understatement. The traders of the coastal merchant cities control most of the wealth. The representatives from the interior have urged us to develop their lands as well to lessen the economic disparity within the country."

GRU_the_linguistic_debate:0 "The Linguistic Debate"
GRU_the_linguistic_debate_desc:0 "One of the clearest dividing lines in the nation is the issue of language. In these lands the knights speak Herzlandisch, the city-dwellers Sicameonese and the locals Gryphussian. Concerns have been raised if the nation needlessly limits itself by only treating Sicameonese as the language of the government. Should provisions be made for other languages as well?"

GRU_power_of_knights:0 "The Power of the Order"
GRU_power_of_knights_desc:0 "During the Congress, grandmaster Weissfisch of the Order of Opinicus has been fervently arguing on the order’s behalf. As it is, they are a mighty force, but the Grandmaster argues the order could become unrivalled if given the backing to do so."

GRU_power_of_traders:0 "The Power of the Company"
GRU_power_of_traders_desc:0 "The Gryphusische Südkontinent-Gesellschaft has been a force in the region ever since it first arrived. Enormous wealth has flown through its claws and will continue to do so. There are those, however, who argue that the company is too powerful and should be checked, pointing out that the company doesn’t have a history of settling for what it has."

GRU_power_of_freetowns:0 "The Power of the Free Towns"
GRU_power_of_freetowns_desc:0 "The Free Towns may have started out as just a bunch of small towns meant to host GSG trade outposts but over the centuries they have grown to be much more. The question has been raised if these towns should be given greater autonomy to actually become 'free' as the name suggests."

GRU_the_company_takes_over:0 "The Company Takes Control"
GRU_the_company_takes_over_desc:0 "Recent events in the Free Towns have not turned out to the liking of the board. We must remedy this situation and take a more active role in managing our assets. This is what happens when you rely on the public sector."

GRU_the_council_holds:0 "The Council Remains in Power"
GRU_the_council_holds_desc:0 "Despite some hiccups along the way, the Free Towns have remained under the Council's control. With any gray areas clarified and any possible legal troubles pre-empted, it is time to roll up our sleeves and see about building something resembling an actual nation."

GRU_the_knights_resurgent:0 "The Order of Opinicus Resurgent"
GRU_the_knights_resurgent_desc:0 "For too long the Order has been left to rot away in the outskirts of the region, never being given the status it should have. No more, it's time for these trinket peddlers to be brought to heel and a new order to rise. For the Grandmaster and for the Order!"

GRU_shared_1a:0 "Liquidate the Opposition"
GRU_shared_1a_desc:0 "Those who tried to interfere with our regime are still out there. Sooner or later, they will try again. There is only one thing to do; pre-empt any such activities through whatever means necessary."

GRU_shared_1c:0 "The Balisemont Trials"
GRU_shared_1c_desc:0 "Traitors, foreign agents and opportunists shall all be put to trial. Gryphus is a place of law, no matter what some may think, and we shall enforce this law severly and thoroughly, so that none may think to challenge us again."

GRU_shared_1b:0 "All's Fair in Love and War"
GRU_shared_1b_desc:0 "We must be reasonable. The Free Towns have been in a state where more overt power grabs were not only a realistic tactic, but almost expected. Are we going to pretend that the griffins who played the game just as we were suddenly are evil for it? Let's instead get some good mileage out of some good old amnesty."

GRU_shared_1d:0 "The Viartorré Accord"
GRU_shared_1d_desc:0 "The time has come to set down a new set of rules for the region. Until now, the political arena was rough and dirty by design. If we wish to clean it up we must establish new rules clearly and without loopholes to be exploited. If we can get all sides to agree to these accords, we just may have managed to civilize not just the land, but its politics as well."

GRU_knights_1a:0 "Every Town a Chapterhouse"
GRU_knights_1a_desc:0 "It is time to establish the order as an omnipresent part of life in these lands. To this goal, every town shall become host to a chapterhouse of the order. This fortified building will serve as as a recruiting office, barracks and local law enforcement headquarters. "

GRU_knights_1b:0 "Enforce Worship"
GRU_knights_1b_desc:0 "These lands will be the lands of the faithful, however that must happen. The faithless will find no home here if they so desperately cling to their false idols. By Boreas, Arcturius and Eyr, these lands will bow before the true gods of Griffonkind!"

GRU_knights_2a:0 "Raise Fundamentalist Militias"
GRU_knights_2a_desc:0 "As we rally the faithful in spirit, we shall rally them in body too! Gryphus will become home to an army of the faithful, and as long as their hearts beat for the Order, they shall find weapons to wield in our service."

GRU_knights_2b:0 "Form the Inquisitorial Office"
GRU_knights_2b_desc:0 "Impurity, witchcraft and heresy run rampant in these lands. They shall know no quarter, however, as we equip our most fervent and dilligent knights with the tools they need to track down and deal with these threats more... indirectly. "

GRU_knights_2c:0 "Preach the Scriptures"
GRU_knights_2c_desc:0 "All these modern, worldly books rot the mind of our people. What use do the faithful have for texts other than the three good books of the true gods? We shall enforce the reading of the three books throughout the lands, lest our people go astray."

GRU_knights_2d:0 "Develop the Interior"
GRU_knights_2d_desc:0 "The crusader fortress-towns deep within the interior of Gryphus are the heartlands of our Order. We have not forgotten our crusading heritage, and hence we must return to further cultivate our inland roots so they may flourish."

GRU_knights_2e:0 "Reinforce the Aerieschloss"
GRU_knights_2e_desc:0 "There is a darkness to the northeast; a land tainted by evil magic and by ponies just waiting to lash out at us. By order of the grandmaster, the fortifications along the border shall be restored and upgraded so that the Order may never again fail in its most central duty."

GRU_knights_3a:0 "Repress the Savages"
GRU_knights_3a_desc:0 "For too long, the savages in the north have been allowed to run rampant, acting as though they are the masters of the forest and the hills. It is time to remind them of their place in the order of things; the bottom. Let them know that either they start will behaving like civilized griffons or they will leave."

GRU_knights_3b:0 "Clease the Debauched"
GRU_knights_3b_desc:0 "Our cities have been havens of sin for too long. Now we cleanse it through book burnings, shutting down nests of vice and arresting those who would violate the good morals of our citizens. We will burn out the rot and leave only the good, strong core of the nation's values behind."

GRU_knights_4a:0 "The Order and the State"
GRU_knights_4a_desc:0 "We are no longer an amusing anachronism to be banished to the wilds! From today and onwards we ARE Gryphus! We define what this nation is and we determine its course! With the gods as our witnesses, the Order of Opinicus has claimed its rightful position. Now, we look forward to determine what the future will hold for us."

GRU_company_1a:0 "Defang the State Apparatus"
GRU_company_1a_desc:0 "Now that the government has been convinced to play nice, it is time to make sure that economic growth can continue unhindered. The first point of order must be to make sure the courts can't be unduly against us, or indeed at all." 

GRU_company_1b:0 "Deregulate the Economy"
GRU_company_1b_desc:0 "These countless and arbitrary regulations are an undue burden on the job creators of the region. Wherever this socialism came from, it is time to free the economy from it."

GRU_company_2a:0 "Crackdown on Competitors"
GRU_company_2a_desc:0 "Competition is a sign of health in a free market, but doesn't that swing both ways? If the smaller companies of the region truly were healthy, they shouldn't struggle so if we apply some more... creative pressures to them. After all, all we do is weed out the unhealthy companies of the region."

GRU_company_2b:0 "Expropriate the Commons"
GRU_company_2b_desc:0 "If the market is to be truly free, we can't indulge these romantic ideas or "natural parks" or "public spaces", and neither can we limit what resources are avilable for private development. Water and access to infrastructure are tradeable properties as well. It's free real estate!" 

GRU_company_2c:0 "Hire Corporate Paramilitaries"
GRU_company_2c_desc:0 "There's been plenty of rumbling in the region recently as the previously babied populace now has to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps. Adding to this, the police does not seem to be much help after we defunded them. To redeem this, we have decided to significantly expand the Company's security detail."

GRU_company_2d:0 "No Such Thing As Society"
GRU_company_2d_desc:0 "It's a comforting fantasy to those without the skills to get ahead in life, but this notion of "society" is just that; a fantasy. The region has reached the state that we can finally start dissolving these useless roadblocks to progress, and if that means that some useless welfare queens will go away, all the better."

GRU_company_2e:0 "Gryps-Süd GmbH Private Institute for Higher Education"
GRU_company_2e_desc:0 "Our industries need highly qualified labor, and we certainly are not going to rely on the public sector to provide enough between all the art and history majors they busy themselves with producing. Instead we shall invest in producing one of the best universities in the region, with jobs lined up and waiting for our graduates."

GRU_company_3a:0 "Institutionalise Indentured Labour"
GRU_company_3a_desc:0 "After our takeover, we have ended up with plenty of prisoners who just sit and uselessly take up resources and space. Why are we spending resources on criminals? If they want to eat, they should work for it, like everyone else does!"

GRU_company_3b:0 "Fortify Corporate Holdings"
GRU_company_3b_desc:0 "It seems we must divert some profits into developing a system dissuading hostile takeovers and government interference. Preferrably, it should consist of bunkers, gun emplacements and trenches. Socialists have such a hard time respecting the law after all."

GRU_company_4a:0 "Achieve Peak Economic Exploitation"
GRU_company_4a_desc:0 "We have done it! Finally we have created an actual free market, where the sweat on a griffin's brow belongs to himself! And as the Gryps-Süd GmbH are the ones who have built this great economic zone, the fruits of it belongs to us exclusively! I love capitalism!"

GRU_council_1a:0 "Peace and Reconciliation"
GRU_council_1a_desc:0 "After all the troubles that have been we must aim forward. Neither the Gryps-Süd GmbH, nor the Order of Opinicus are going away any time soon. We are going to assert our dominance of course, but after that we must offer a way forward for all involved parties."

GRU_council_1b:0 "Strengthen the Gryphussian Constitution"
GRU_council_1b_desc:0 "The waters of Gryphussian politics have more than its share of predators swimming through it. As our first step, we shall amend the constitution to shore our nation up legally and make sure there are safeguards to ensure we never have to deal with situations like these again."

GRU_council_2a:0 "Institución Para El Desarrollo Armónico"
GRU_council_2a_desc:0 "As part of our development of this nation, we have a unique chance to make it a learning experience. After all, the progress that needs to be made is a golden opportunity to try out new techniques and methods as well. Let us make use of this and teach what we learn to the rest of the world."

GRU_council_2b:0 "Empower Indigenous Griffons"
GRU_council_2b_desc:0 "After recent events it seems like it would be helpful to make sure that the indigenous Gryphussians are well represented among the armed forces. They have little love for neither the Order, nor the Company, and that could be very useful if things ever go south. We can ensure their loyalty by granting them full rights and citizenship."

GRU_council_2c:0 "Education and Healthcare"
GRU_council_2c_desc:0 "We must make sure to provide for the needs of our people. A healthy, literate citizen is much more productive and therefore of much greater use to the nation. Also, we should make sure to limit the influence of the privave sector just in case the Gryps-Süd GmbH gets any ideas..."

GRU_council_2d:0 "Citizenship for All"
GRU_council_2d_desc:0 "We are still an underdeveloped nation, yet one with boundless potential. What we need more than anything else are more claws in our fields. Let us make it easy for ourselves and open the borders wide, giving everygriff who wants to come here a chance. Just make sure the knights are told so they don't think it's an "invasion"."

GRU_council_2e:0 "Ustawa o Robotach Publicznych"
GRU_council_2e_desc:0 "We're not going to remain just a bunch of towns separated by wilderness. To this end, we have prepared a comprehensive government program that will subsidize and encourage construction projects throughout the nation. Also, just in case, we've added in a clause about needing to deliver on promises."

GRU_council_3a:0 "Allow Free Elections"
GRU_council_3a_desc:0 "The path has been long, but Gryphus is growing stronger day by day. The future is ours, and now our people take the final step towards the road to democracy. It is time for the first Gryphussian elections. No longer mere towns, now we face the future as one, united nation!"

GRU_shared_2a:0 "Economic Leg-up"
GRU_shared_2a_desc:0 "We are doing well indeed, and yet there is still much left to do. We should focus our efforts on the economy in order to grow the prosperity of the nation."

GRU_shared_2b:0 "Scientific Leg-up"
GRU_shared_2b_desc:0 "Money spent on industry may yield results tomorrow, but money spent on science may yield returns far into the future as well. We should focus our investments within the fields of education and science for long term benefits."

GRU_naval_doctrinal_reformation:0 "Naval Doctrinal Reformation"
GRU_naval_doctrinal_reformation_desc:0 "Gryphus’ wealth has always been made through the sea, and yet our navy is ageing and underdeveloped. That won’t do. What do we look like? Cyanolisians? It’s time to bring our fleet up to date with modern times."
GRU_naval_1:0 "Screening Vessels Development"
GRU_naval_1_desc:0 "We are a nation rooted in trading and escort ships are our navy’s bread and butter. Modern ships, however, require more than just cannons. Fortunately we have contacts back in old Sicameon that can help us acquire more modern vessels."
GRU_naval_2:0 "Ship-of-the-Line Development"
GRU_naval_2_desc:0 "Sometimes, you must project greater force than your enemy. Contacts in Rottendedam have acquired blueprints for vessels that can outgun any Zebra pirate or Cyanolisian freebooter that wishes to challenge us."
GRU_naval_3:0 "The Pythagoros Naval Institute"
GRU_naval_3_desc:0 "They say it takes 300 years to build a naval tradition and the Free Towns have been here even longer than that. Between all the smugglers, pirates and ‘honest seafarers’ around, our nation has plenty of knowledge available, and our Admirality has the wherewithal to make use of these experiences."
GRU_naval_4:0 "Submersible Development"
GRU_naval_4_desc:0 "If all other ways to compete fails, it helps to stop your competitor’s goods from reaching their destination. These new ships move underwater and strike without being detected. Used correctly, they offer immense value for the money."
GRU_naval_5:0 "Heavy Dreadnought Development"
GRU_naval_5_desc:0 "Some would call the investment excessive, but, even if we do not buy them it is clear others will. We will not be second rate."
GRU_naval_6:0 "The Shipyards of Pythagorea"
GRU_naval_6_desc:0 "Buying ships is inherently uneconomical. With large scale investments into the Pythagoros dockyards, we will begin creating a Rottendedam of the south!"
GRU_aerial_doctrinal_reformation:0 "Aerial Doctrinal Reformation"
GRU_aerial_doctrinal_reformation_desc:0 "The sky is the final frontier and war has come to it just like everywhere else. It is time for Gryphus to take to the sky as well."
GRU_aerial_1:0 "Close Air Support Development"
GRU_aerial_1_desc:0 " How many times have our forces been in a situation were a few machine guns from above would have helped? Finally we can make this dream reality."
GRU_aerial_2:0 "Light Fighter Development"
GRU_aerial_2_desc:0 "If we are going to make use of the sky, we must first control it. Light, agile fighter planes will be the best bet to make sure that we, not our foes, dominate the air."
GRU_aerial_3:0 "The Loulé Aviation College"
GRU_aerial_3_desc:0 "If Gryphus is to have a proper air force we must invest. Having recruited veteran air pilots and engineers from all over Griffonia, we are going to establish what hopefully, one day, can be one of the premier institutes for the study of aeronautics."
GRU_aerial_4:0 "Medium Aerofighter Development"
GRU_aerial_4_desc:0 "Tactical bombers and Heavy Fighters will take our air force from our own airspace into the heart of the enemy’s, letting us strike everything from Falcor to Nimbusia if we would need to."
GRU_aerial_5:0 "Heavy Aerofighter Development"
GRU_aerial_5_desc:0 "We could fight the enemy at the fronts, or we could fly over their heads, blow up the factories that produce their weapons and then strike."
GRU_aerial_6:0 "The Airfields of Gryphus"
GRU_aerial_6_desc:0 "With airfields established both by the coasts and inland, the know-how to build and to fly as well as a young, but budding tradition of flight, Gryphus is now poised to become a real air power. As the locals say: "Do Nieba!" "
GRU_army_doctrinal_reformation:0 "Army Doctrinal Reformation"
GRU_army_doctrinal_reformation_desc:0 "It used to be so simple: hire mercenaries, give them some baselines and then you had an army. Modern times demand more than this, however, and it is time to lay the foundation for a true army."
GRU_army_1:0 "Infantry Weapons Development"
GRU_army_1_desc:0 "Firearms technology has never progressed quite as fast as nowadays and we will not be left in the dust."
GRU_army_2:0 "Landcruiser Development"
GRU_army_2_desc:0 "Reports from the north talk of new weapons: vehicles fitted with heavy armor and cannons. Already the empire has created entire units around these \"tanks\" and we have gotten the chance to acquire blueprints for these weapons. We can’t pass up this opportunity"
GRU_army_3:0 "Mechanised Troops Development"
GRU_army_3_desc:0 "If you can transport cargo in it, you can transport people in it. This is true of ships and is is true of trucks. The end result is both quite logical and very fast."
GRU_army_4:0 "Magitech Rifles Development"
GRU_army_4_desc:0 "The latest and most exciting development in the field of weaponry is magical firearms. These weapons may be primitive right now, but that’s only all the more reason to get in on this early!"
GRU_army_5:0 "Support Companies Development"
GRU_army_5_desc:0 "No griffon who knows what they’re talking about think that warfare is just about griffons with guns. Modern warfare needs much, much more, and that’s all the more reason to get in on researching and designing the best support gear we can."
GRU_army_6:0 "Forest Fighters"
GRU_army_6_desc:0 "Most of our lands are forested and it is a disgrace that we have not truly made use of this fact. Our forces can’t sit around at the coasts only: it is time for the Gryphussian soldier to become the master of his homeland’s terrain."
GRU_military_shared_1:0 "Developing a Marine Corps"
GRU_military_shared_1_desc:0 "Our military can fight on land and it can fight at sea. It is time to combine these two things and create a force that can strike from the water towards land wherever we need them to."
GRU_military_shared_2:0 "Developing a Paratrooper Corps"
GRU_military_shared_2_desc:0 "Military development means being faster, flying higher, striking harder, fighting better. An elite corps of soldiers who can leap from transport planes high above and land deep in enemy terrain is just what we need to accomplish all these things."
GRU_military_shared_3:0 "The Gryphussian Cazadores"
GRU_military_shared_3_desc:0 "A special training regime for our knights will let us make the most use of them in more unconventional situations. Our Free Towns do not need stiff paladins, but canny hunters. The Gryphussian Cazadores shall form our absolute elite and make a name for themselves wherever the Free Towns call them."
GRU_military_shared_4:0 "Mercenary Diamond Dog Ironpaws"
GRU_military_shared_4_desc:0 "The Diamond Dogs are very reasonable creatures. Money talks, and it does so loudly and clearly enough that we've managed to secure a series of contracts that will let us field the very best soldiers the Diamond Dogs have, the legendary Iron Paws."
GRU_military_shared_5:0 "The Gryphussian Esprit de Corps"
GRU_military_shared_5_desc:0 "Ours is a legacy of adventurers and swashbucklers, who took on whatever challenges appeared with great abplomb and enthusiasm. This spirit of facing down danger with eagerness and gusto is what makes our soldiers among the best there are. So with that said: Adelante, Vorwärts and Do przodu!"
GRU_develop_interior:0 "The Night Forest Express"
GRU_develop_interior_desc:0 "The great Night Forest is a mysterious and dangerous place to us, even after so many years in these lands. It is time to address this and start cutting out way through it and let the railroads run north all the way to the Cossack lands and the Aerieschloss."
GRU_develop_coast:0 "The Transcoastal Railway"
GRU_develop_coast_desc:0 "From Camafeu to Rei Macaco, our towns dot the coastline like shining pearls. Let us now through the railway bind them together into a grand necklace that will be able to live and breathe together as one. "
GRU_industrial_shared_1:0 "The Riches of the Ecole Mountains"
GRU_industrial_shared_1_desc:0 "The eastern mountains hold immense wealth that has not yet been possible to exploit thanks to the fractured nature of our nation. Now we can finally develop the area and make good use of the riches the mountains hold."
GRU_industrial_shared_2:0 "New Iron Mines"
GRU_industrial_shared_2_desc:0 "Our prospectors discovered rich veins of ore not many years ago, but so far no one has invested in opening new mines to exploit them. It seems we'll have to do it and reap the profits for ourselves."
GRU_industrial_shared_3:0 "Gryphus Land Clearances"
GRU_industrial_shared_3_desc:0 "It really does not matter where you go, there's still potential for land-development. If we start to seriously clean up the terrain, there will be untold amounts of land available for exploitation."
GRU_industrial_shared_4:0 "Purchase Foreign Electronics"
GRU_industrial_shared_4_desc:0 "This brand new concept of "electronics" is beyond fascinating, and we have been making use of a lot of our contacts to get our claws on these things. Considering how things are going, electronical equipment may well become something for the common griffon. When it does, we want to be in on that market."
GRU_industrial_a:0 "Night Forest Arsenals"
GRU_industrial_a_desc:0 "As industry spreads throughout the nation, we are able to decentralize our production of arms. It'll either be closer to the northern front, or away from the vulnerable coasts. A fine place for arms production all the same."
GRU_industrial_b:0 "Night Forest Manufactories"
GRU_industrial_b_desc:0 "We're going to slowly transform the Night Forest from a sea of wilderness to an archipelago of civilization. Factories dispersed around the region will give more life to it, give the locals disposable income AND increase production."
GRU_industrial_c:0 "Extensive Development"
GRU_industrial_c_desc:0 "This is not just some two-bit leisure project that we are embarking on. We are going to develop the region thoroughly and exensively. We must make sure that our engineering and extraction technology is up to the task, because we are going to need it."
GRU_industrial_d:0 "Night Forest Fuel Silos"
GRU_industrial_d_desc:0 "There's a lot of space in the forest, and the idea has come up of expanding the oil silos in the region to make the most use of them. Why spend prime real estate on storage when you could build factories there instead?"
GRU_industrial_1:0 "Invest in Pythagorea State Industy"
GRU_industrial_1_desc:0 "Pythagorea is and has always been the industrial powerhouse of the region. As part of our expansion efforts, we shall triple investments in this industrial zone and make the Pythagorea Industrial Zones the envy of the south."
GRU_industrial_2:0 "Fund the Balisemont Gunworks"
GRU_industrial_2_desc:0 "The Balisemont region has plenty of potential and as part of our industrial expansion we have decided to make it an arms manufacturing centre to rival any in the region."
GRU_industrial_3:0 "Intensive Development"
GRU_industrial_3_desc:0 "The modern eras need modern industries and these industries will be larger and more developed than anything ever seen before. We can't afford to do this by half, so let's make sure we are up to date on the latest in industrial engineering."
GRU_industrial_4:0 "Camafeu Oil Refineries"
GRU_industrial_4_desc:0 "The lifeblood of the modern world is Oil, and those who can produce and refine it will rule the world. Building a series of state of the art refineries in the east will let us make good use of the black gold."
GRU_industrial_shared_5:0 "The Logic Machines of Colégio"
GRU_industrial_shared_5_desc:0 "The university of Colégio have asked for funding to attempt to create their own series of logic machines. We still aren't quite sure we believe what they are saying. Thinking machines? What next? Walking on the moon? Still, it is exciting enough to give it a try."
GRU_industrial_shared_6:0 "The Cloudtower of Riaportu"
GRU_industrial_shared_6_desc:0 "The concept is insane, but all the plans we have been shown says it can be done. While it would take all our industrial and scientific capacity, we may well be able to build a device unlike anything ever seen before: a weather control tower."
GRU_industrial_shared_7:0 "The Great Ribs of Tiefbrunnen"
GRU_industrial_shared_7_desc:0 "Deep in the Night Forest rests the bones of a creature larger than anything we have seen before. These bones rise over a dozen stories high and are a source of immense potential. The resources available through these bones could supply all of Gryphus and more. It is time to organize an expedition."
GRU_industrial_shared_8:0 "Subsidies for the Poor"
GRU_industrial_shared_8_desc:0 "Despite our advances, many griffons are still trapped in poverty. Therefore, we are going to implement a system of tax breaks for the poorest. After all, if they get some money over, they will likely feed it back into the economy anyway. It's worth a try."
GRU_industrial_shared_9:0 "Mandatory Elementary Schooling"
GRU_industrial_shared_9_desc:0 "Anygriff can cut a tree down, but working a twelve tonne machine in the factories demand more in-depth skills. This is especially true if we are going to get enough engineers to keep up the pace of development. It's time to put our people into school."
GRU_communist_civil_war_focus:0 "Workers of Gryphus, Unite!"
GRU_communist_civil_war_focus_desc:0 "Rise, Gryphus! The time has come to stand up. We are not going to be torn between tyrannnical knights or ruthless capitalists any longer. Today the workers of Gryphus will take charge of their own fates!"
GRU_form_foreign_legions:0 "Form Foreign Legions"
GRU_form_foreign_legions_desc:0 "Revolutionaries and disaffected soldiers rally to our banner from all around the world. They come to fight and, if need be, die for our freedom. We will arm and prepare these brave griffons so that they will be able to fight like the heroes they are."
GRU_form_peoples_militias:0 "Form People's Militias"
GRU_form_peoples_militias_desc:0 "From the dockyards, factories, fields and mines they rise, ready for the struggle ahead. They are no trained soldiers, but we will train them. They have no weapons, but we will equip them. They are the lifeblood of the country, and that blood will now flow to save it."
GRU_knights_of_labour:0 "Knights of Labour"
GRU_knights_of_labour_desc:0 "They are heroes of the new age: the knights who traded their position as enforcers of tyranny for the vanguard of the revolution. Already disillusioned with the Order of Opinicus, they will lead the way into the fires of revolution."
GRU_propaganda_campaign:0 "Agitprop Campaign"
GRU_propaganda_campaign_desc:0 "We must spread the word in every way we can. From posters on the street corners to agitators and indeed over the airwaves we must let the people know of what we are fighting for and what is at stake."
GRU_recruitment_campaign:0 "Recruitment Campaign"
GRU_recruitment_campaign_desc:0 "We still lack soldiers for this struggle, but there are those out there who would fight, and we shall do our best to rally them as well."
GRU_victory_for_workers:0 "A Victory For The Proletariat"
GRU_victory_for_workers_desc:0 "We did it! Against the mercenaries of the Gryps-Süd GmbH and the fanatics of the Order of Opinicus we fought and we triumphed! Yet, we must not get too drunk on our victory. This is not the end, rather it is a beginning."
GRU_stronger_united:0 "Stronger United"
GRU_stronger_united_desc:0 "Under Comrade-General Aniela Gryfón, we shall embark on a quest to unite the towns and peoples of Gryphus into one cohesive whole. The world is dangerous, and we shall meet its challenges head on."
GRU_a_free_confederacy:0 "A Free Confederacy"
GRU_a_free_confederacy_desc:0 "The Free Towns have never been an united whole, and trying to force it together by force would be wrong. Instead we will be united in cooperation, locking no one who wishes to work together to build a free and prosperous Gryphus out of it."
GRU_abolish_private_property:0 "Abolish Private Property"
GRU_abolish_private_property_desc:0 "One of our first priorities in order to break the hold of the capitalists is to do away with the large, privately owned estates and factory complexes that dot the nation. They belong to those who would have torn the nation asuder for their own greed, it is no more than right that they pay the price."
GRU_wealth_redistribution:0 "Redistribute Wealth"
GRU_wealth_redistribution_desc:0 "This nation was built on wealth inequality and the time has come to do away with that and fast. The old mayors and executives built their power on this wealth, and without it they will have nothing."
GRU_secularization:0 "Separation Of Faith And State"
GRU_secularization_desc:0 "It is time to wean the nation of the dogma of the Order and the machinations of the clergy. In time we may decide on more extreme measures, but for now we will settle for simply locking the religious forces out of the halls of power."
GRU_universal_healthcare:0 "Universal Healthcare"
GRU_universal_healthcare_desc:0 "While people lay sick and indeed dying, the rich celebrated their quarterly gains. It's time to end this and ensure that everygriff receives the medical care they need. Never again shall someone's health be seen as "a business opportunity"."
GRU_universal_education:0 "Universal Education"
GRU_universal_education_desc:0 "Keep the workers illiterate so they cannot read revolutionary books. Keep the natives illiterate so they will struggle to organize. It was an effective scheme, but it's time to break it and equip each griffon in the nation with the skills and knowledge that modern education provides. "
GRU_comrades_abroad:0 "Our Comrades Abroad"
GRU_comrades_abroad_desc:0 "Our victory was won in no small part due to foreign revolutionaries who threw aside the notion that kinship ends at the border. It is time that we repay this favor and arm ourselves to go forth and aid the revolution wherever it may manifest."
GRU_worker_cooperatives:0 "Establish Worker Cooperatives"
GRU_worker_cooperatives_desc:0 "The Gryps-Süd GmbH was extremely top-down controlled, and yet now it ends. We will now invest the workers that slaved in the factories and mines with the power once held by the board."

GRU_anticap_market:0 "Anti-Capitalist Free Market"
GRU_anticap_market_desc:0 "While we cut away the exploitation and the uneven power balance of capitalism from society, we are going to leave some parts intact. The market, in and of itself, need not be a tool of oppression if managed carefully."
GRU_local_militias:0 "Local Workers' Militias"
GRU_local_militias_desc:0 "If the worst comes to pass and the reactionaries come to break us, we will defend Gryphus to the very end. All workers will be given the skills and the tools to defend their homes. That way, even if our enemies seize our land the question will be how much they are willing to pay to hold onto it."
GRU_ally_prelate:0 "Ally With The Prelate"
GRU_ally_prelate_desc:0 "The Prelate of Gryphus is a reasonable griffon. He has not railed against us or encouraged dissent, rather he has kept to providing solace and advice to those who will listen. Why make an enemy of such a griffon when we can make him an ally and work together for the people's benefit?" 
GRU_indigenization:0 "Korzenizacja"
GRU_indigenization_desc:0 "No one who lives in these lands should consider themselves an outsider. All peoples, whether new here or having lived here since forever, should have a place and a voice.

GRU_ministry_of_security_desc:0 "The Revolution is not finished yet, and as we work to spread it, there are countless dangers lurking in the shadows as reactionaries and revisionists seek to undermine us.

GRU_heavy_industry:0 "Focus On Heavy Industry"
GRU_heavy_industry_desc:0 "In order to prosper, we cannot let our industry be scattered about. Instead, we must centralize and create strong, well developed industries with the ability to outpace demand whenever is needed. The age of workshops is over and the age of the industrial complex is here."

GRU_eliminate_bourgeois_nationalism:0 "Eliminate Bourgeois Nationalism"
GRU_eliminate_bourgeois_nationalism_desc:0 "The Free Towns of Gryphus is an artificial construct by capitalism that the elites tried to pretend was a nation worthy of loyalty and honor etc. Truly, this example better than anything shows the inherent absurdity of nationalism. It is time to get rid of this nonsense once and for all."
GRU_atheization:0 "Atheization"
GRU_atheization_desc:0 "Religion is the poison through which the Order of Opinicus crept into the nation, and through it the reactionaries will try to reassert their power. Be it kings or gods, we will not blindly bow to either."

GRU_free_the_slaves:0 "Free The Slaves"
GRU_free_the_slaves_desc:0 "For too long, the opportunistic Zebrican raiders in the east have been allowed to run rampant. It is time for them to be brought to justice for their countless crimes!"
GRU_liberty_in_lushi:0 "Liberty In Lushi"
GRU_liberty_in_lushi_desc:0 "In their little corner of Griffonia, the feudal lords of Lushi have been allowed to fester for centuries. Too irrelevant for anyone to care about, they've been sitting unquestioned in their castles for too long. It is time for even this piece of Griffonia to feel the fires of the Revolution!"
GRU_attack_asterion:0 "Attack Asterion"
GRU_attack_asterion_desc:0 "The prideful minotaurs wrestle with their past of enslavement and yet miss the additional chains that they have bound themselves in. It will be a tough fight, but we cannot give up on them."

### EVENTS ################################
###########################################
gryps.1.t:0 "The Congress at Riaportu"
gryps.1.d:0 "After weeks of preparation, all the major factions of the region have gathered in Riaportu to sit down and determine the future of Gryphus. Representatives from each of the Free Towns as well as several high ranking members of the Order of Opinicus and the board of the Gryps-Süd GmbH are present for what is set to be among the most important weeks in Gryphus’ history."
gryps.1.a:0 "We have much to do."
gryps.2.t:0 "Debate: The Power of the Knightly Orders"
gryps.2.d:0 "During the afteroon, Grandmaster Weissfisch requested the word to speak and pushed his way onto the stage, ignoring the concerns raised about scheduling conflicts as he spoke up, speaking of how his order for centuries had guarded the southern flank of Griffonia and how they had asked for nothing but the ability to carry out this duty. Yet, he said, in these times they had been left a withering husk, ill equipped for the challenges ahead. He requests that the Congress moves to strengthen the position of the knights so that they may carry out their duty even in this new age." 
gryps.2.a:0 "Strengthen their powers."
gryps.2.b:0 "The Knights are an anachronism!"
gryps.3.t:0 "Debate: The Power of the Free Towns"
gryps.3.d:0 "The Free Towns exist in a strange kind of limbo, neither truly independent nor centralised. Their sovereignty vary from town to town and yet they have been too busy squabbling with each other to formulate a consistent policy. Thanks in no small part to outside forces, we have finally managed to ge the towns to sit down and decide on one of two options. Has the time come to centralize the Free Towns, or should we fully decentralize?"
gryps.3.a:0 "Grant them more autonomy."
gryps.3.b:0 "A centralised state is a strong state."
gryps.4.t:0 "Debate: The Power of the Trading Houses"
gryps.4.d:0 "The Gryps-Süd GmbH is by far the most powerful company in the region, but it is not alone. Taken together, these many trading houses are immensely powerful, to the point that many have viewed them as the true rulers of the region. Until now, we have been too divided to do anything about it, but now we have a chance to address this.\n\nA Balisemont representative has raised the possibility of limiting the influence private enterprises can have on the region, but several others have objected, pointing out that these companies are the reason the Free Towns even exist."
gryps.4.a:0 "They are too powerful, and must be checked!"
gryps.4.b:0 "We must respect the Free Market."
gryps.5.t:0 "Debate: The Languages of Gryphus"
gryps.5.d:0 "Somewhat awkwardly, the first weeks of the meetings became slightly chaotic as it seemed none had considered the prospect that Gryphussian would be spoken during the Congress as well, which made the introduction of the Gypsburg delegation a complete fiasco. Things worked out in the end, but the stunt became a strong "Exhibit A" for the Gypsburg mayor as he brought forth a motion to recognize the three languages of Gryphus; Sicaemonese, Herzlandisch and Gryphussian, as equal among the Free Towns.\n\nThe proposal has ruffled more than a few feathers, especially among the knights who called it "an embarrassment" but the issue is up for consideration all the same."
gryps.5.a:0 "Multilingualism is way forward."
gryps.5.b:0 "We have no need for the language of savages."
gryps.6.t:0 "Debate: The Gryphussian Economy"
gryps.6.d:0 "Traditionally, the interior of Gryphus has been sparsely developed to say the least. Development has been confined to the coasts, where the ships arrived. We stand before a new era, however, and the question has been raised of whether we can afford to leave the interior as underdeveloped as it currently is.\n\nOthers have said that focusing effort on developing the interior, where less than a quarter of our population lives, is wasteful and inefficient. They instead argue for keeping the industry at the coasts as it always has been.\n\nWhich part of the region should we focus on developing?"
gryps.6.a:0 "The Coast!"
gryps.6.b:0 "The Interior!"
gryps.7.t:0 "The Indigenes' Appeal"
gryps.7.d:0 "Representatives from the indigenous Gryphussians have made an appeal at the congress for the Free Towns to rein in the Order of Opininicus.\n\nThe knights have been recently expending their holdings into land the Gryphussians have evidence is their by ancient law and custom. The knights, meanwhile, point to their need to secure the area to contain eventual threats from Barrad and their ancient mandate to protect the region."
gryps.7.a:0 "The Knights are our allies."
gryps.7.b:0 "We must respect the rights of the locals."
gryps.8.t:0 "The Free Towns' Appeal"
gryps.8.d:0 "The Gryps-Süd GmbH representatives have brought up several proposals during the meeting, many of them concerning further abolishment of the few legal restrictions still placed on them. The Company maintains this will be for the benefit of everyone, but concerns have been raised whether this will cut away the few restrictions still placed on them." 
gryps.8.a:0 "Free Trade and Progress For All!"
gryps.8.b:0 "We Must Curb the Company's Excesses!"
gryps.9.t:0 "A Wild Challenger Approaches!"
gryps.9.d:0 "We had thought that the Riaportu Congress would have brought stability, but rather, it seems the opposite has happened!\n\nFighting is raging in the streets and the chaos is total. The local authorities are fighting back as we try to understand what is going on."
gryps.9.a:0 "What is going on?!"
gryps.10.t:0 "Teambuilding Exercise"
gryps.10.d:0 "As the congress came to an end, with all the involved parties finally agreeing to the deal set forth, it quickly became apparent that the day was not yet done. An enraged mob of Gryphussians stormed the building, armed with sabres and spears. As it became evident that the status quo would not change, local extremists decided to take matters into their own claws.\n\nThankfully, this attempted coup was quickly routed. The knights, in full plate armor, quickly formed shield walls to block the entrances as the Company's security detail - equipped with the latest weapons - could begin firing back out of the windows to drive back the attackers. This brought the local garrison time enough to rally, and even as blood flows in the streets, today the unity between the Company, the Order and the Free Towns was established."

gryps.17.t:0 "The Knights Refuse!"
gryps.17.d:0 "Unbelievable! In Gryphus' greatest hour of need, the knights are absent! The Grandmaster has stated the order's intent to withdraw to its eastern holdings and guard the border.

The Board wishes to assure the nation that the Gryps-Süd GmbH will continue to provide top-class services in line with the demands of a modern market, and that it will continue to develop the region to make it world-leading within..."\n\nAlong with this statement, the Company has rapidly moved to secure its powerbase.

Throughout the streets of every town, white-clothed and heavily armed knights are moving, enforcing the curfew with whatever means necessary and severely punishing any who dared to cause disorder. In Riaportu, the Grandmaster and Privy Council are currently convening to decide on what the future is to hold for the order.\n\nAfter many hours, near midnight, the path was finally laid out: Gryphus is to be purged of everything that can threaten the Order's sacred mission, be it the Company, the indigenes or the Free Towns. All shall bow before the order, and finally it shall rise to be able to carry out its sacred duty."

gryps.22.d:0 "After the chaotic coup attempt the instigators are still out there, lurking in the shadows as they wait for their next chance to strike. Today it has been shown that they are not going to get any second chances. Armed soldiers have kicked down doors all over Gryphus, arresting hundreds and at several occasions summarily opening fire at the least sign of resistance.\n\nIt mattered not whether these griffons were at home, at work or anywhere else. The directive given from the top has been clear and absolute: "Remove these people from society", and it has been left up to the plotters and traitors whether that means being dragged to prison or a bullet to the neck."
gryps.22.a:0 "None shall threaten us like this again."
gryps.23.t:0 "The Amnesty"
gryps.23.d:0 "Contrary to what many expected, the authorities seem to have decided to be lenient towards the losers of the recent coup attempt. Stating the need for unity instead of discord, they have commuted the sentences of several high-ranking members of the opposition. While the Riaportu government has placed several limitations on the opposition leaders, many are still shocked at the level of clemency shown."

#Triggers if council prevails and knights attempted coup
gryps.24.d_knight_executed:0 "After weeks of planning, the Balisemont Trials were finally held. Their preparations had been rocky. Some supporters of the Order accused the Council of carrying a biased caricature of justice despite the great care that had been put into making the trial as fair and impartial as possible. However, few could claim that this was a regular trial. Some priests and fanatics held public prayers for the traitorous knights but were quickly chased by simple citizens and faithfuls who had turned against the Order. Some among the general populace felt betrayed by what they saw as a lack of candor in the Council’s conduct. Many feared that by looking undecisive and weak in the face of the knight’s betrayal, they were inviting. And so, groups of citizens tried to form barricades around the courtroom, only to be disbanded by the police.\n\nNone of it mattered in the end. The streets remained calm throughout the trial and it was in the courtroom that disorder occurred. Grandmaster Weissfisch made no attempt to hide his guilt and doubled down instead on his refusal to consider the gryphussian state as legitimate anymore. He stood defiant as he was read his sentence to death, trying to disrupt the trial by chanting his oath to his Order. The knights who carried out the coup attempt and most of the Opinicus hierarchy were hanged alongside him."

gryps.24.d_merchant_captain_executed:0 "The preparation of the Balisemont Trials was a messy and complicated affair. Despite the evidences and the robustness of the case, lawyers employed by the Gryphusische Südkontinent-Gesellschaft remnants tried every trick in the book to delay the trial or strike a deal. One could almost have admired their dedication to such a lost cause but in the end even the most well-funded layers are not gods granting miracles. The trial went forward as expected.\n\nThe trial itself went smoothly despite the desperate pleadings of the defendants. In the end, the sentences were announced and to nogriff’s surprise, it was death. Nearly two centuries after the charter of Grover III, the Gryphusische Südkontinent-Gesellschaft golden age in Gryphus had come to an end."

With the nation purged of the greed and weakness that would have brought us all down, maybe the time has come to formally reshape Gryphus to a kingdom of the faithful and the ultimate bulwark of the south.\n\nOthers have argued that the Order of Opinicus was founded as a crusading order and should return to that. In the east, the ponies are still threatening the empire, especially with the reports that they have been working to unite. Therefore, the order should once again pick up the crusading banner and go forth to spread the light of the gods."

Today, however, several grand steps have been taken towards asserting oureslves. Carefully, we have step by step amended the the Gryphussian Constitution, carving out the legal future of our nation like a sculptor out of marble.\n\nThere have been countless worries among the populace, whether this would just lead to a centralized super-state, but instead we have made sure that every citizen knows that the Constitution exists to safeguard them.\n\nThis does extend to the Gryps-Süd GmbH and the Order of Opinicus as well, who both have received concessions that allow them to carry out their respective jobs to greater effects."
gryps.29.a:0 "This is our golden compromise."
gryps.30.t:0 "Reconciliation with Our Enemies"
gryps.30.d:0 "Blood had to flow before Gryphus could begin marching towards unity, and the wounds this left still remains. We must make amends for the pain caused, if nothing else in order to be able to move forward.\n\Therefore, in a public speech, Chairgriffon Yeve de Viartorré, spoke of the regrettable events at the end of the congress, and how the Riaportu government posthumously pardoned all who had taken part in the attempted coup. Blaming it on unease and rising tensions, rather than branding what happened a premeditated coup, he called for unity and for the nation to move forward, to a better future for everyone."

Both sides have come to the Congress and have by now taken up weeks of time to get a judgement in their favor.\n\nUnless we want this congress to continue for months on end while these two arch-enemies bicker, we have to make a snap judgement on who is in the right. Right now, it does not even matter who is right, just that we need to get these idiots out of the chambers so we can get anywhere."

Traditionally, the ship has been based out of Loulé, but local representatives of Pythagoros have been campaigning for the ship to be transferred to them instead.\n\nSomehow, while we're trying to determine the very fate of the nation, we have ended up trying to mediate over the fate of where a ship should be based."

Most of the industry in our land will be turned towards this project due to its sheer scale, but the rewards it offers is something beyond what we could have dreamed of: control over the very weather.\n\nThis wonder of the modern world will let us direct the weather around Riaportu however we please, creating not just a paradise climate, but an unparalelled defensive tool as well. With it, Gryphus will be the nation to set the bar for modern wonders."

Its goal: the Tiefbrunnen Ribs, where they will be able to drill for the oil deposits that lie deep under those giant bones. With everything from industrial equipment to Mosquito nets, it is prepared to take on whatever the forest is going to throw at it.\n\nThere's yet some adventures left in these lands, and our explorers are eager for what's to come. If this goes well, it will be a boon to Gryphus unlike anything we could have dreamed of."

gryps.39.t:0 "Complications at the Ribs"
gryps.39.d:0 "Upon reaching the ribs, the expedition barely had time to start unloading before a large group of locals came out of the forest, several of them armed with sabers or even rifles, making the security teams scramble to prepare for battle.\n\nThankfully the locals didn't seem interested in fighting. Rather, to the expedition's shock, a proper-looking griffon came up to them and addressed them in Herzlandisch. He introduced himself as Jaspis Białoryb, a former Company agent who left his position after being disgusted with the treatment of the locals.\n\n"I know that you are here to exploit the ribs as a resource," he has told the crew, "but you won't find what you are looking for. These lands are sacred to the locals, have been since before the Free Towns were built, and there's a good reason for it. Look at this beast... can we even fathom how magnificent it must have been in life? There is nothing left quite like it, not even the mightiest of dragon can compare, and these bones are the last memento of its kind. Is all this truly going to be destroyed for the sake of extra profit? Is it impossible to leave this beast to its rest?""

It seems the Free Towns have changed since I left, and if you will have me, I will gladly serve you as compensation for your understanding."\n\nMr Białoryb is anything but a random bureaucrat, and old Company records reveal just how much he has stymied its efforts during the  already the Army has expressed its excitement at having his talents on our side."

To the enthusiastic countdown of the crowd, the engineer pulled the lever, activating the tower and making a sudden rainstorm break out for only a minute before pulling it again and turning the weather rapidly back a sunny day.\n\nThe crowds erupted in cheers as the sun appeared once more, with the orchestra starting to play once more.

The refineries had been not simply destroyed, but torn asunder as if attacked a titanic creature... Even more disturbingly, however, is the fact that both the crew as well as the remains of the Ribs themselves are completely gone, as if they never existed...\n\nThe damages are catastrophic, repairs will be monumentally expensive, and new crews are blindly refusing to enter the forest after this. It seems like we provoked something in the forest, and finally the forest bit back."

gryps.53.d:0 "As the dust finally settles, emerges a nation free from the three tyrannies of the Council, the Order and the Company. Unfortunately, the rushed nature of our revolution means our provisional government has focused almost solely on the fight and the new Gryphussian state apparel is virtually non-existent. Many griffons have fought for us, not out of an informed adhesion to the socialist ideal but out of hatred for the old order. In a way, we found ourselves in the same situation as the free Gryphussians of old.\n\nTo remedy the situation, the provisional government under has unanimously agreed to disband itself and call for a general Rada of all Gryphus. All villages, tribes, sicz, old knightly estates and urban districts have been called to send a freely elected representative. The few trade unions Gryphus counts and revolutionary military units have also been allowed to send their own elected representatives.\n\nSadly, despite the great expectations over the first people’s Rada, the debates over the construction of our revolutionary state has boiled down to a binary choice for leadership. The first is Aniela Gryfon, the heroine of the revolution, who led our troops to victory. She’s tremendously popular among the army and the interior’s representatives, especially the former Order’s serfs. Her grasp of socialist ideals is however a little vague and she seems primarily focused on securing the country against any return of the griffonian knights. The second choice is Edward Piorowski, an intellectual who organized and presided the provisional government. Very popular in the coastal cities in which he organized the workers against the Company, he has lost a lot of support during the Rada. His ideological speeches in favor of mutualism has fallen on deaf ears among many countryside. He also underwhelmed the crowd by calling for reconciliation and open claws approach to the foreign minorities. The union workers have however kept their unanimous support for him and he was applauded for sicameonese and herzlander citizens who worry about Aniela’s Gryphussianocentric views.\n\nAfter lengthy debates, a leadership vote was called. Whatever the result is, the race promises to be very close."

gryps.54.d:0 "As knights and company griffs fight each other and burn down land and cities, a song slowly rises from all corner of Gryphus. It is the song of unity for all oppressed griffs. It is the signal calling every griffs to the revolution. From all corners, they come and assemble. From the cities, it is the workers of the Company’s wharfs and warehouses. From the Night Forest, it is the serfs who toiled as slaves in the Order’s estates. From the rivers and the plains, it is those who fled already to the sicz. From the hills and mountains, it is the tribesgriffs who survived the knight’s "pacification" campaigns. It is Gryphus, true and yearning to live free.\n\nAs we speak, the west is now under our control. The Company’s warehouses in Camafeu are seized and their content distributed to the masses. In Grypsburg, the Order’s Komture is burning and its commander has been hanged atop the walls. Yet, victory is not yet within our claws. It will take weeks for the revolution to assemble its armies. Many hurdles await us as our ragtag of griffs joins the fight and is organized into a true army of the people. Meanwhile, the country burns. But the truth is, it has been burning for a long time now."
gryps.54.a:0 "We have nothing to lose but our chains!"
gryps.55.t:0 "Alliance offer"
gryps.55.d:0 "The ambassador from the Union of Gryphus has formally offered our country to ally ourselves with his home country. Our diplomatic corps seems enthusiastic at the proposal. There would be many benefits to increased cooperation and mutual military aid. Such an alliance could help entrench the cause of socialism in the Evi Valley and help us in expanding it further.\n\nHowever, there are some how say that the revolution remain fragile and that such a step could lead us to a war we are not prepared for. We have little to fear from our comrades in Gryphus but they could inadvertently lead us to ruin.\n\nThe debate has fortunately remained calm and our decision shouldn’t cause any serious controversy within the administration."

It is only a matter of time until all of Griffonia is free from the shackles of tyranny."
gryps.56.a:0 "There is no freedom without solidarity!"

gryps.57.d:0 "In a sad development, we have received confirmation that our offer of alliance has been declined. Our diplomats are scrambling to renew the talks but our ambassador says there is little hope for a change of course.\n\nDespite this, [Root.GetLeader] has downplayed the gravity of the situation and reminded the country that as the people of Gryphus had prevailed alone in the past, it shall again in the future. With life and arms, the Union of Gryphus will endure !"
gryps.57.a:0 "With life and arms!"
gryps.58.t:0 "Protests Against Nationalization"
gryps.58.d:0 "Our widespread policy of nationalization has taken a turn for the worse. While the idea of nationalising the assets of the Order of Opinicus and the Gryps-Süd GmbH was deeply popular, popular support for our policies has collapsed after the population discovered how extensive it would in fact be. Worse even, party members have relayed concerns that nationalization was beginning to be seen as the same as the Order and the Company’s rackets, just under a red flag.\n\nAs a response to the crisis, Aniela called a national referendum to renew public trust and bolster support. After the vote, she has called the results of 78% in favor of nationalization a proof that criticism of the state’s policy was nothing more than reactionary attempts at subversion. The problem is those numbers were fake. The non-rigged vote count tallied support for nationalization at barely 28%. The worse part is : party members leaked the results and a wave of protests has swept over Gryphus.\n\nMost cities have seen hundreds of protesters, organized or spontaneous. In the coastal cities, the situation is worse and thousands are marching in the streets The biggest show of support was in Camafeu where close to fifty thousands griffons marched peacefully, lead by Edward Piorowski and the Solidarity movement. In Colégio, the police and protesters clashed, killing two protesters and hurting many more. Pythagoros saw extensive rioting and the local party headquarters partially burned down."
gryps.58.a:0 "We'll have to delay the reforms..."
gryps.59.t:0 "Fierce Resistance To Collectivization"
gryps.59.d:0 "The Panstwowe Gospodarstwo Rolne program that was supposed to completely reorganise the Gryphussian agricultural sector in vast state farms and forests is nearly collapsing on itself under the weight of crass incompetence and overly high ambitions. The planners’ reports are increasingly worrying and the secretary of agriculture had to recognize in the central committee that Gryphus’ food sector wouldn’t be self-sufficient for at least the two coming years, an unthinkable situation.\n\nIn the coastal areas, the reorganization of the vast domains of the Company went smoothly at first but the reconstruction saw significant setbacks with lack of supplies, theft of reserves and poor preservation and distribution of seeds that caused many to arrive rotten in the fields. Poorly designed quotas also forced productive domains to reduce their production, causing agricultural production to collapse. As a result, local leaders tried to preserve the appearance of organization and full-employment by sending peasants on already full-capacity fishing boats, causing conflicts and accidents.\n\nHowever, it is in Aniela’s home region of the Night Forest that the worst happened. Serfs there fought against the Order to be able to gain control of their small farms which were rented to the Order. During the revolution, many carved up the estates into small farms. Collectivization was more than a bad policy to them : it was treason of the promises made by Aniela herself. Nationalized forest and farms were sabotaged or even burned down by farmers and several party members got beaten up.\n\nTo prevent an insurgency, Aniela reversed course and called for a "Gryphussian road to socialism" that would include private farming. She even tried to embrace the small Night Forest farmers as a form of spontaneous socialism. The response was mixed but at least, party members are no longer getting beaten up by angry peasants..."
gryps.59.a:0 "Guess we'll leave them alone."
gryps.60.t:0 "Mass Arrests"
gryps.60.d:0 "It is no secret that Gryphus has been rocked by constant protests and disobedience after the first Rada. One could hardly object to the fact that Gryphus was unready for socialism, many being no more than lumpenproletariat, as Caramel Marks wrote. If the revolution is to be safe, it will need significant adjustment. After weeks of secret and careful planning, the newly organized Ministry of Public Security has launched Operation Sortowanie.\n\nAt six o’clock in the morning, our agents have begun raiding a large list of targets in all major cities and protests hotspots. Officials have ordered all citizens to remain indoor as Gryphus was subjected to a regrettable "streitzeit", an old term used by the Order of Opinicus to describe a form of moral martial law in the face of general danger and chaos. Official propaganda also justified it by magical occurrences caused by Barrad mages.\n\nThe targets were numerous : party members who criticized our nationalization programs, leakers and referendum officials, defectors from the old regime, protesters and more. The Solidarity movement was also banned and known organizers were also arrested. Edward Piorowski managed to disappear in the streets of Camafeu and some speculates he fled to Sydia.\n\nPrisoners were taken by carts, forced march or, for the lucky ones, trucks to labor camps in northern Hashide and Tsumina. There, they would be forced to work to limit and contain the damages caused by Barrod’s magical experiments. They will also receive an extensive course of reeducation to become once more productive members of society. The most dangerous ones would never reach the camps however and roads would be dotted by little plots of disturbed dirts. Moles are numerous this season, aren’t they?\n\nSeveral low-priority targets took refuge in the temples of Eyr. Our agents had orders not to interfere but to observe how the clergy would react. They are safe. For now."
gryps.60.a:0 "Gryphus is safe."
gryps.61.t:0 "Reign Of Terror"
gryps.61.d:0 "Operation Sortewanie had been a success at creating a concrete party core, quickly nicknamed the "beton". However, the party remained only a small healthy part of Gryphus while the country was still infested by reactionaries and the lumpenproletariat. To remedy this, youth organizers, members of the revolutionary army and members of the Ministry of Public Security organized the newly formed citizen militia and prepared it for Operation Rozwiązać.\n\nThe plan was to deploy units of the militia in all major settlements. They were supposed to instill resolve in the national spirit through community activities for the loyalists and to remind less obedient citizens of their duties.\n\nImplementation of Operation Rozwiązać has gone... somewhat poorly. Militiagriffs had been instilled with revolutionary zeal but they lacked discipline. The "community activities" that the central committee had planned became mass demonstrations both forced and encouraged by militiagriffs. These demonstrations were targeted against protesters and opponents let go in the aftermath of Operation Sortewanie but also after random citizens. Temples, bars and foreigners residences were burned. It effectively became a top-down riot. Thousands were put in front of makeshift "citizen courts" for paranoid trials. Thousands were condemned to death on hastily assembled gallows.\n\nIn some places, members of the Ministry of Public Security allowed the riot to go on while others tried to salvage the situation by commuting sentences to hard labour, sending thousands of griffs to the Aerieschloss labor camps to protect them, ironically enough."
gryps.61.a:0 "Note to self: militias do not multitask."
gryps.62.t:0 "The Nonsensowne Fabryki"
gryps.62.d:0 "The central planning administration has seen many restructurations since its foundation. Planners responsible for the nationalization and collectivization plans were mostly reassigned due to the monumental failure of the operations. Active and former Members of the Solidarity Movement and followers of Edward Piorowski were also banned for fears of sabotage or leaks. Secretary of planning Małymłotek assured he had finally a competent planning administration. Well, like his predecessors.\n\nIndustrial reports are bad. The most notable example is the tractor factory in Viartorré that was inaugurated by Małymłotek and General Gryfon herself. The factory was presented as a pinnacle of Gryphussian industry but the internal reports are depressing at best. The tractor that was presented to the crowd was actually an equestrian repainted tractor left in a warehouse by the Gryps-Süd GmbH. While the engineers did manage to retro-engineer it with replacement parts and produced a poorer version, production is currently impossible as the Viartorré electrification plan remains unimplemented due to a lack of resources. Parts production in Camafeu and Pythagoros is also impaired by the slowness of distribution of metals coming from the Ecole mines as the planners failed to assign shipping to these factories. At the same time, the factory supervisors complains about a 52 pages list of useless equipment that was wrongly assigned to it. This factory and many others are being nicknamed "Nonsensowne Fabryki", nonsense factories...\n\nOverall, modern industrial production is woefully behind schedule, made with problematic corner cutting and inefficient. This means that a lot of older and artisan workshops are still in used, as are manufactories of the Gryps-Süd GmbH. Note should be taken that overall production has increased but only because of a significant lowering of quality and safety standards. Consumer goods suffer the most from this.\n\nOne bright spot does exist. The small guns factories that were built on Chlropeia do not report any significant problems and the officers report no significant jamming or accuracy issues."

gryps.63.t:0 "Negativas Terrorist Attack"
gryps.63.d:0 "The sun was shining over Riaportu. A fine day for a protest, really, Clarissa thought. She was happy to be there. It felt like a moment that needed to happen. She had even managed to convince her sister Nayara to join. If not for politics, for which Nayara cared little, at least for getting together and simply hear the chants in Sicameonese. The protest was going well. Thousands were there, chanting, all in the name of simply for the right of speaking Sicameonese like their families always had. The Negativas they were called but it wasn’t simply about refusing. The Solidarity Movement was there too but they kept their distances, supporting but understanding it was not their voice that had to be heard today.\n\nClarissa smiled. Eversince the revolution, griffs like her were discriminated against, seen as bourgeois reactionaries. Yet, a lot of them had supported the revolution, only to sour against it after all the disasters it had brought. Some even missed the days of the Company. Clarissa never understood all that. She was a socialist herself and her family had paid the price for the cause. Her father died in the battle of Pythagoros and her mother was killed during a protest before the revolution. She even heard she took a bullet for Edward Piorowski himself. Her sister didn’t understand. She only saw that the revolution took her parents. Yet, she still joined her.\n\nThat is when all went wrong. The protest was heating up but nobody expected things to go like they did. Nogriff had brought guns, the organizers forbade it. They should have. A loud explosion suddenly resonated. The city hall had been hit by something and debris began to rain down on the nearby protesters. An elderly griff next to Clarissa was hit by a piece of brick and fell. She froze for a moment as screams and angry orders started to follow the deafening blast. Then, a young griff turned to them and told them a simple word in their language : run. Clarissa didn’t ask. It wasn’t her first protest, even if she had never seen anything like this. She took the claw of her sister and ran with her.\n\nThey got stuck with a group of protesters fleeing in the streets. They turned but hit a wall. A dead-end. They tried to flee back but the group was not budging. Clarissa raised her head and saw : the militia had blocked the entrance of the street, guns in claws. She didn’t yell. There was no time. She turned to her sister and pushed her, telling her : "Play dead, whatever happens, do not say anything !". Her sister tried to protest but Clarissa held her against the ground as the officer yelled the final word they would ever hear, yet they didn’t understand it : "Ogień !""
gryps.63.a:0 "We won’t forget this. The Negativas will pay!"
gryps.64.t:0 "Priests Condemn Communism"
gryps.64.d:0 "Since the days of the revolution, the clergy has had an uneasy relationship with the revolution. Many clergygriffs - at least those who weren’t integral members of the Order of Opinicus - didn’t join the reactionary side during the war and stayed neutral. Some even welcomed the revolution as a necessary correction of the old regime failures. Many were convinced by Edward Piorowski but now, it is clear that the clergy has broken with our regime.\n\nEven before we took steps toward implementation of state atheism, the priesthood was persecuted, especially during the Operation Rozwiązać. Militiagriffs burned down temples, arrested and executed priests. The temple of Eyr in Pythagoros that hosted many political opponents was burned down by the militias in one of their most infamous riots. The prelate of Eviliana in Camafeu was transformed into a barracks. Its priests were accused of supporting Brodfeld in the Prywhen civil war. The temple of Sycaecia in Rei Macaco was destroyed as retaliation for the Negativas attack in Riaportu. Then, the body of the popular Solidarity-aligned prelate Gustaw Całkowitośćy was found mutilated and disfigured in the Evi river. It was denounced by the state as an isolated crime but few griffs were fooled. it was the final nail in the coffin.\n\nThis all caused many priests and the prelate of Boreas in Riaportu to start condemning the state’s actions in their sermons, criticizing communism as an affront against morality. The Ministry of Public Security tried to intervene but ultimately ruled against it. After a heated debate in the central committee, the decision was upheld as even the "beton" of the party acknowledged the danger of pouring gasoline yet again on the fire. order was given to try and placate the clergy."
gryps.64.a:0 "The path to atheism will be longer than we anticipated..."
gryps.65.t:0 "Rozmowy Okrągłego Stołu"
gryps.65.d:0 "The murder of prelate Gustaw Całkowitośćy and the bloody repression of the Negativas in Riaportu have caused a renewed wave of protests in all of Gryphus and a general strike has caused our industry to crawl to a halt. Despite the ban on their movement, the Solidarity movement has reappeared and lead the protests. Worst, Edward Piorowski reappeared in Camafeu and joined claws with the clergy and the negativas, forming a united front against us. The white and red flag of Solidarity flew over large crowds of workers in every major settlements. The army and militia refused to disperse the crowds. Officers reported fraternization between our soldiers and protesters, increasing number of desertions and abysmal morale. One thing was clear to all in the government : Aniela Gryfon and the beton of the party had failed. \n\nAfter a few days and the refusal of the military to break the protests by force, the party accepted a round table talks with the opposition leaders. The beton hoped to compromise and divide the opposition but to no avail.\n\nThe Rozmowy Okrągłego Stołu compact was signed. Under its terms, elections would be held and the Solidarity movement would be allowed to freely participate in it. An independent commission would investigate the murder of Całkowitośćy and the handling of the negativas protests and attack in Riaportu. The political prisoners would be freed and the labor camps in Aerieschloss would be closed.\n\nAfter a rushed and tense election, the results showed a landslide win for the Solidarity movement. While some within the party sought to fix the election to at least maintain some level of influence, Aniela Gryfon refused. All remembered the abject failure of the nationalization referendum and she had grown tired of politics. She conceded defeat and resigned, along with her government.\n\nDespite some expectations of a significant purge, the new general secretary of the Union Edward Piorowski announced a truth and reconciliation commission to lay foundations carefully, for a new and free country."
gryps.65.a:0 "Solidarity! This is our day!"
gryps.66.t:0 "Nie Ma Wolności Bez Solidarności"
gryps.66.d:0 "Gryphus has known many years of pain and suffering. We have come a long way from the days of the three tyrannies, when our ports were at the claws of the Company, our lands under the paw of the Order, all under the incompetent eye of the Council. The revolution had been bloody and the skeptics said we were only trading a banner of oppression for another, just in a redder shade. In the end, freedom and solidarity prevailed.\n\nGryphus is not perfect, no country could ever claim to be. But now, even the weakest of griffon leaves under a roof, well-fed, cared for when they are ill and warm even in the harshest of winters. The industry hums along, producing quality goods without sacrificing the safety and welfare of workers. A multilingual education and public discourse have mended the rift between the hertzlander, sicameonese and Gryphussian communities of the country and allowed science and culture to thrive.\n\nGryphus is no longer a country one flees or abandons. It is one embraced by refugees and migrants from all Griffonia and beyond even and we embrace them back."
gryps.66.a:0 "We hold our heads high, despite the price we have paid, because freedom is priceless."

gryps.67.t:0 "Sunrise on Gryfów"
gryps.67.d:0 "The city now to be known as Gryfów - formerly Grypsburg - was once a bustling market town deep within the Gryphussian interior before the crusaders arrived. With their religious zeal they occupied the town as their base of operations, bestowing it with a proper Herzlander name and cementing its status as a stronghold of the Opinicus Order. Campaigns of terror and intimidation against the local population ground them into submission as their native culture, language, and traditions were systematically repressed - actions taken with the best interests of the natives in mind, you understand; only the superior Herzlander culture and martial spirit of the knights could protect Gryphus against the Riverlander threat.\n\nOur colonisers now lie defeated by the people of Gryphus, and the stranglehold of the Opinicus Order over the Gryphussian interior has finally been broken. As celebrations erupt all over the new country, the native people of Gryfów have now found the courage to reclaim their city for themselves. A new age dawns over Gryphus, and the people of Gryfów shall be the vanguard of this Brave New World."

 FRN_crisis_in_wingbardy_desc:0 "Ever since the brutal Falcor War, Wingbardy has been in various degrees of turmoil. Now the infamous fascist, Guilio Beakolini, is preparing a march on Karthin while communists riot on the streets. We are closely tied to Wingbardy, but the fate of our ally stands on the edge of a knife. Yet all we can do is wait, and hope for the best."
 FRN_allies_not_subjects:0 "Allies, Not Subjects"
 FRN_allies_not_subjects_desc:0 "Long have we been Wingbardy's friends, but in recent decades this relationship has turned increasingly sour. Wingbardian companies dominate Francistrian economy, Wingbardian culture overwhelms any native traditions, and worst of all, the troubles of Wingbardy affect us directly. Francistria must distance itself without angering its powerful ally."
 FRN_cooperate_with_socialists:0 "Cooperate With PSA"
 FRN_cooperate_with_socialists_desc:0 "Partito Socialista Agrario, the agrarian socialist party, has always opposed Wingbardian influence and protests the rise of fascism. Count Francis thinks their ideas align with his own and considers asking for their assistance. This must be kept secret from the nobility and the blackshirts of LPF, for they despise leftists."
 FRN_dismiss_wingbardian_advisors:0 "Dismiss Wingbardian Advisors"
 FRN_dismiss_wingbardian_advisors_desc:0 "While the aid of Wingbardian advisors is appreciated, it cannot be denied that their influence on our economy and military has grown too great. Instead of relying on Wingbardian investors to fund our economy and Wingbardian officers to manage our army, we must learn to fly with our own wings."
 FRN_nationalize_businesses:0 "Nationalize Wingbardian Businesses"
 FRN_nationalize_businesses_desc:0 "Wingbardian control over our economy needs to be curtailed. Local companies are unable to compete with foreign-owned behemoths such as Taloniel, which in turn drain money away from Francistria. PSA has proposed that we nationalize these companies, transferring their assets to state-owned ones. Francis has decided to compensate the foreigners in defiance of PSA."
 FRN_independent_army:0 "An Independent Army"
 FRN_independent_army_desc:0 "During the Falcor War the Francistrian army cooperated very closely with the Wingbardian one; so much so that it almost merged into it. However, in the end it is the army of Francistria, and not of Wingbardy. Our military command does not need to follow Wingbardian orders and we should not rely on Karthin to dictate our strategy and doctrine."
 FRN_defensive_doctrine:0 "Adopt A Defensive Doctrine"
 FRN_defensive_doctrine_desc:0 "During Francis VIII's reign, Francistria went on daring offensives several times. The end result? Unruly conquered land and a dead Count. Francis IX has no interest in replicating the military escapades of his predecessor. From now on, Francistria will focus on defending its borders. How, exactly, will soon be decided."
 FRN_meet_with_talonuel:0 "A Meeting With King Garibald"
 FRN_meet_with_talonuel_desc:0 "The recent actions taken by the Count have not pleased our ally, the King of Wingbardy. If we wish to still remain in the Karthinian Pact, or worse, face direct intervention from Wingbardy in our internal affairs, the Count must meet with the King and mend our divides."
 FRN_protectionist_policy:0 "Implement Protectionist Policies"
 FRN_protectionist_policy_desc:0 "Lady Bianca has long complained that her companies cannot compete with cheap Wingbardian imports. Our own industry cannot grow for every domestic demand is already filled by foreigners. Clearly action must be taken to nurture the growth of our industry. Temporarily imposing tariffs and import quotas will limit the amount of foreign goods on our market."

 ### Advisors & Concerns
 FRN_vittorio:0 "Governor-General Vittorio Felice"
 FRN_vittorio_desc:0 "The former second-in-command of Francis VIII who fought alongside him in the Falcor War, Vittorio Felice is a scarred and old veteran. Force is what keeps nations together, and in his eyes the Karthinian Pact is a proto-nation which will one day become a unitary Wingbardian state. Tarrinians and Falcorians are Wingbardian too, they just don't admit it unless some sense is knocked into them."
 FRN_bianca:0 "Lady Bianca Bentivoglio"
 FRN_bianca_desc:0 "Ruler of the small but prospering Ladyship of Eatela, Bianca Bentivoglio sees herself as the benevolent overlady of her subjects. She is soft-spoken, but has a sharp mind and a strong business sense. She is the head of several Eatelan companies which are at the forefront of Francistrian industrialisation, but is forced to compete with Wingbardian ones who have an advantage in the market. Out of all the nobles of Francistria, she is the only one who doesn't make fun of Count Francis IX."
 FRN_dante:0 "Baron Dante Covello"
 FRN_dante_desc:0 "The young and infamous Baron of Roameo holds the finest banquets and parties in the County, but his subjects are impoverished and his lands are a wooded backwater. He is charismatic and well-spoken, but he is selfish and a talented liar. He is a griffon of contrasts, and is thusly both adored and despised."
 FRN_ippolita:0 "Viscountess Ippolita La Ciliegia"
 FRN_ippolita_desc:0 "Ippolita La Ciliegia was once the wife of Francis VIII, before he tragically perished in the Falcor War. She has been a widow ever since and has refused to marry. She bore no offspring for the Count and is rumoured to be infertile. The lands she rules over, however, are anything but infertile. The Viscounty of Goldenfeather is the breadbasket of the country and even exports food to Wingbardy, especially as the Prywhen Civil War prevents grain imports and eliminates competition. But focusing solely on agriculture has made her Viscounty underdeveloped, and the ever-increasing need for more food production is a strain on the local peasants."

 FRN_giacomo:0 "Giacomo Dalleotti"

His values are a strange mix of conservatism and communism, advocating both the end of nobility and the preservation of traditional Francistrian culture. While he wishes for the ultimate abolishment of monarchy, he sees the nobles and fascists as a larger threat and is willing to cooperate with the Count. He distrusts the Talonuel Dynasty and wishes the Wingbardian communists there prevail despite their persecution."

 ### Country Leader & General descriptions
 FRN_coward_count_desc:0 "Giosé Debolino Martlewing, whose regnal name is Francis IX and who is commonly known as "Francis The Stammerer", is the most unusual Count of Francistria in its history. He was the third child of Francis VIII's younger brother, and the only legitimate heir when the previous Count perished unexpectedly in the Falcor War. No one ever expected him to hold any important position, so his parents had given him little attention. In fact, the only attention he ever received from others was abuse and mockery because of his stuttering, which made him withdrawn and shy.\n\nUnlike his predecessors, Francis is not a proud and loud warrior. He is quiet and prefers to spend time in his private chambers or in the woods near Martlewing Castle, undisturbed by servants and officials. As such, the nobility, fascists and the Tarrin resistance all see their chance to gain power at the expense of the weak and pathetic Count, who will never amount to anything."
 FRN_angry_bird_desc:0 "Gherita Zarfatti is a veteran of the Falcor War, leader of the fascist LPF, rumoured mistress of Beakolini and, last but not least, a journalist and an art critic with a refined taste. She is the rising star of Francistrian politics, closely cooperating with Beakolini at all times. Her ultimate dream is Risorgimento, unification of all Wingbardian-speaking lands under one nation. She considers Tarrin to be a Wingbardian-speaking land, despite 86% of its population speaking Aquileian as their primary language. As an expert propagandist, she is convincing more and more Francistrians to share this belief."

He distrusts the Talonuel Dynasty and wishes the Wingbardian communists there prevail despite their persecution."
 FRN_cutebird_desc:0 "Arturo Azzurino, commonly known as "The Bloodhound of Soarleto", is a young but highly promising general who has rapidly risen through the ranks after the Falcor War. In that conflict he was little more than a sergeant, but became known for his bold (if harsh) leadership and atrocities committed against the Falcorians. His brutality impressed Vittorio Felice so much that he personally promoted and awarded him for his service. However, in the years since Arturo has grown distant from Vittorio due to his support of the fascists. He is a proud Francistrian and wants his homeland to remain independent."
 
 ### Events
 francistria.1.t:0 "The Council Convenes"
 francistria.1.d:0 "It remains unclear how Francistria itself will be affected by Wingbardy's crisis. Some fear that Wingbardy will radicalize, while others think a new golden age will await as long as Francistrians trust in their Wingbardian friends. There are many different opinions and debates among the country's nobility, so to come to an agreement the most influential nobles have agreed to meet at Francistria. The young Count is invited as well, though he is not expected to influence the decision making much.\n\nThe Martlewing Castle, standing upon a hill next to the city of Francistria proper, soon received some prestigious visitors: Lady Bianca of Eatela, whose ladyship was small but prosperous, Baron Dante of Roameo, known for his parties and charms but also for the poverty of his forested lands, Viscountess Ippolita of Goldenfeather, the breadbasket of the country, and last but not least, Governor-General Vittorio Felice of Tarrin. Francis came to meet them, though was too shy to say a word.\n\nAfter a formal dinner, the five gathered in a chamber to discuss what Francistria should do with Wingbardy. The Governor-General and the Viscountess both advocated maintaining close relations to the southern ally, while the Lady of Eatela said Francistria had relied on Wingbardy too long and should seek to reduce excessive Wingbardian influence. The Baron had fallen asleep, but when he woke up, said "What have those accursed Wingbardians ever done for us? Where was the King when Falcor burned down Roameo? They call us allies but treat us like a pet dog."\n\nThe nobles' council erupted into shouting and arguing, with the Governor-General and Viscountess accusing the others of endangering their vital relations, while the opponents said the two personally benefited from Wingbardy and disregarded its negative influence on Francistria. Count Francis remained silent, and even considered hiding under the table. But then the council went silent and turned to look at him. They were at a deadlock, with two on each side. Francis could cast the deciding vote and resolve the situation. And so, he awkwardly stuttered:"
 francistria.1.a:0 ""F-Francistria must reassert its s-sovereignty.""
 francistria.1.b:0 ""We c-can always trust Wingbardy, our a-ally.""
 francistria.2.t:0 "Fascist March In Francistria City"
 francistria.2.d:0 "In support of Beakolini's march on Karthin, the paramilitary fascist organization LPF prepared its own, smaller-scale march in the center of Francistria City. Unlike Beakolini's PNF however, they did not plan to seize power in the nation. The march was organized to show solidarity to brothers and sisters in Wingbardy, and to display the ever-increasing power and influence of LPF.\n\nUnlike in Karthin, there was no opposition to their march when it began, or at any point during it. At most, only a several citizens threw some insults at the fascists, but most dared not anger them. The blackshirts marched in orderly columns like a military battalion, lead by the infamous army officer Gherita Zarfatti. She had long been the leader of LPF and was rumoured to be Beakolini's mistress. Following her, the columns reached Martlewing Castle, and began to sing Giovinezza, a song favoured by Beakolini's fascists. Francis stayed inside and did not dare to go outside before they eventually left.\n\nIt seems there is nothing in the way of the fascists, so they can freely continue to pompously posture and attract new members."
 francistria.2.a:0 "Worrying..."
 francistria.3.t:0 "The Count's Burden"
 francistria.3.d:0 "The Count sat in his office, shuffling documents. Before, the Martlewings had always been absolute monarchs, but Francis IX usually delegated tasks to nobles. This time was an exception. Reforms regarding Francistria's relationship with Wingbardy felt too important. Talonuels had always been friends of Martlewings. It would simply add insult to injury if a Martlewing didn't oversee the changes himself. However, he had little knowledge of policy-making and diplomacy. He even barely knew how to read and write, having taught himself to do both as a child.\n\nThere was a knock on the door and Francis snapped out of his thoughts. The Lady and Baron had wanted to meet him and discuss about Wingbardy with him. Hesitantly, he got up and opened the door. The two nobles greeted him, happy that he had supported them in the council, but Francis remained stoic and silent. They all sat down.\n\n"S-so, um, what d-did you have in m-mind?" Francis asked with his stutter.\nThe Baron shrugged. "Nothing, personally. I honestly do not care for the entire matter. I was merely returning a favour to Lady Bianca in the council," he said and winked at her with a coy smile.\nShe rolled her eyes and presented a thick stack of papers. "I have an entire program for curtailing Wingbardian influence. You can trust me with this task."\n\n"A-actually," Francis said quietly, "I don't think I can let others handle this. I-it's too im-important. I have to-to do something m-myself for once."\n\nThe Baron lifted an eyebrow. The Lady sighed and clasped the Count's claw. "Poor Francis. Listen, don't pressure yourself into doing anything. I know how difficult this is for you. You were never supposed to be burdened so greatly."\n"Sor-ry, but I have t-to. I hope t-t-this doesn't offend you."\nShe shook her head. "No no, it's fine. But at the very least take advice from us. And do find someone capable to help you. You can't do this yourself, Francis dear."\nHe nodded slowly and even made brief eye contact with her."
 francistria.3.a:0 "She is right."
 francistria.4.t:0 "An Unlikely Ally"
 francistria.4.d:0 "The leader of PSA, Giacomo Dalleotti, wandered in the entrance hall of Martlewing Castle, his beak open in awe and eyes wide open. "Mamma mia, such a fancy abode for a mere clawful of griffons!" he exclaimed.\n\n"P-please, keep it q-quiet," Count Francis asked, standing next to him. "This meet-ting is supposed to be sec-cret."\n"Apologies, mister Francis. I am simply amazed by the luxury your family has. I lived my entire life in a mud hovel, eating grandma's pasta every day! Meanwhile I am sure you enjoy a different species of fish every day."\n"N-no, I don't e-eat much. A-anyways, I have some q-questions for you, first of-of all."\n"Go ahead, then. I am very curious to know why a Count wishes to talk to a lowly peasant like me."\n"You and your p-party oppose W-Wingbardian influence, right?"\n"Yes," he said and nodded.\n"You also have the b-best interest of the p-people in mind?"\n"Yes of course," he said and nodded.\n"And you want to d-do something about those b-blackshirt... blackshirt thugs?"\n"Yes, yes!" he said and nodded quickly. "Why are you asking all this?"\n"Y-you are perfect then. I-I am asking for y-your help."\nHis eyebrows rose. "My help? Of me and PSA? Oh, such a privilege! Francis VIII would've loved to behead us all personally. You are not at all like him!" He grabbed Francis' claw and shook it enthusiastically. "Mister Francis, from now on you are considered our comrade!"\nFrancis smiled ever so slightly. Behind him in the shadows, an eavesdropping servant turned to leave. She had heard enough. Zarfatti will be furious when she reveals this meeting to her."
 francistria.4.a:0 "Well this was unexpected."
 francistria.5.t:0 "A Scandalous Ally"
 francistria.5.d:0 "On the following day, the frontpage of Campi di Taloncana contained the news about Count Francis personally endorsing the communist PSA party, and rumours began to form of the cause of the strange act. Fascists of LPF were, unsurprisingly, outraged and claimed the leader of PSA Giacomo Dalleotti had somehow extorted or threatened the Count for political favours. Once Lady Bianca of Eatela heard of this, she immediately took a train to Francistria City to meet with the Count.\n\n"If I may ask, what were you thinking?" Bianca asked. Francis was sitting behind his desk, absentmindedly shuffling papers so he had an excuse to avoid eye contact.\n"Y-you told me I should g-get help. And s-so I did."\n"But why some dirty communist peasants? I'm not angry, I just want to understand. It's... strange."\nFrancis let out a deep sigh. "They are l-like me, the p-peasants. Always op-pressed and bullied and t-told they can do n-nothing. But unlike m-me, these socialists st-truggle to make the world a b-better and more eq-qual place, free of oppression and f-fear. It's b-better to ask, why wouldn't I ask t-their help?"\n\nBianca nodded, now realizing his motivation. "I... see. If you put it that way, I can understand why you did it. But it was still a rather silly thing to do, as the fascists and nobles are upset."\n"To Tartarus with them," Francis muttered, without stuttering. "Bunch of bullies. I don't need them."\nBianca raised an eyebrow. "Not even me? I'm a noble, after all."\nWith a faint smile, Francis glanced at her eyes. "With you, I sup-pose I c-can make an excep-ption.""

 francistria.6.t:0 "Francistria Nationalizes Wingbardian Companies"
 francistria.6.d:0 "Bothersome news from Francistria: Count Francis has made the controversial decision to nationalize Wingbardian businesses and their assets. He stated that the reason for doing so was the excessive influence they had over their economy, and how it drained funds away from their country. It is rumoured that the local socialists of the PSA encouraged the Count to do this act. Knowing his meek character, he only did this because he was coerced to do so.\n\nSeveral of our companies have now lost a substantial amount of wealth and property, including our mining companies which can no longer operate on Francistrian soil. However, the Count has personally compensated them for their losses out of his own pocket. Whether we like it or not, Francistrians are now much less dependent on the Wingbardian economy than they used to be."
 francistria.6.a:0 "An interesting development."
 francistria.7.t:0 "Tarrin Socialists Express Support"
 francistria.7.d:0 "An unexpected message has been delivered to Count Francis from the Tarrin Liberation Front. While the police suspected the letter to contain a bomb, it proved to be completely innocuous and was presented to the Count. In the message, the socialists of the resistance movement commended Francis for choosing to cooperate with their comrades in the PSA and for boldly refusing to back down even after protests from the fascists of LPF. They wished he would listen to the advice of Giacomo Dalleotti in regards to the rights of peasants and workers. As a further sign of cordiality, the socialists promised to not commit any acts of terrorism for an entire week."
 francistria.7.a:0 "Thank you, I suppose?"
 francistria.8.t:0 "Tarrinians Celebrate Nationalization"
 francistria.8.d:0 "It seems the resistance fighters of FLNT are happy to hear that Wingbardian assets have been nationalized. Several Wingbardian companies have been accused of seizing land and property from locals in Tarrin and treating their workers poorly. Especially the activities of Wingbardian oil companies in Transista have been questionable at best.\n\nHowever, the Tarrinians now worry what the County will do with everything it has seized, and how the now state-owned companies will treat Tarrinian workers. They are more than willing to go back preparing bombs and ambushes if the Francistrian government proves to be no better than the Wingbardian capitalists."
 francistria.8.a:0 "A brief respite."
 francistria.9.t:0 "Terrorist Attack In Tarrin"
 francistria.9.d:0 "A military patrol in the city of Tarrin was attacked by terrorists of the Front de Libération Nationale de Tarrin on midday. The soldiers were marching in a loose column when a nearby civilian truck suddenly exploded, killing two of them in an instant as well several bystanders. Before the soldiers could recover, a group of masked militants attacked from several directions, wielding rifles and shouting "Vive la Tarrin!". In the ensuing firefight many more soldiers lost their lives or suffered wounds before reinforcements arrived and drove back the terrorists. In the end, our casualties consisted of nine soldiers, dead or wounded, while the terrorists lost four. In addition five civilians were caught in the crossfire. One FLNT fighter was taken prisoner but managed to commit suicide with a hidden knife before she could be interrogated."
 francistria.9.a:0 "These are becoming increasingly common..."
 francistria.10.t:0 "In The Shadow Of A Giant"
 francistria.10.d_lady:0 "It was late evening and Count Francis was headed to another meeting with the nobles. He had taken the long route in a vain attempt to delay the session, his pawsteps echoing in the empty halls of the Martlewing Castle. He stopped near a large marble statue of his predecessor, Francis VIII, and examined it closely.\n\nIt depicted him as a larger than life figure, a stern, scarred veteran who did not fear death or Maar himself. He had a uniform adorned with countless medals, with a ceremonial sword in his claws. This griffon had boldly seized Tarrin from Aquileia and fought on the frontlines during the fateful Falcor War.\n\nCount Francis IX felt very tiny compared to the imposing statue. He in fact felt pathetic. How could he ever hope to even come close to such a mighty griffon? And why should he even try? He had never been prepared for this. Being a ruler is such a headache. It is a position that should only be held by the strong and determined.\n\nHe snapped out of his thoughts as he noticed another griffon entering the hallway. It was Lady Bianca of Eatela.\n"Oh, there you are, Count. I was wondering what was taking you so long. Baron Dante is getting very impatient."\nFrancis looked at the floor. "S-sorry ma'am, I just g-got distrac-cted. I w-will be there s-shortly"\nBianca glanced at the statue. "Ah yes, Francis VIII. I remember him well. This statue might depict him as a mighty warrior, but in reality he was an angry, bitter griffon. His relationship with his wife, Ippolita, was very rocky. That's why he never had children, and that's why you inherited."\nFrancis looked up. "R-really? I d-didn't know that."\nBianca turned back to him and placed a claw on his shoulder. "Giosé, if I may use your birth name, I know this is a burden to bear. But don't make it worse by deluding yourself that you need to be as "great" as other Martlewing Counts. In the end, they were all flawed in their own way.""

 francistria.11.d:0 "Despite the cool relations Francis had with the military, he had no choice but to meet with officers in person if he wanted to have any influence on his nation's army doctrine. Therefore he summoned the commanding generals to Martlewing Castle to discuss the matter.\n\nWhen Governor-General Vittorio Felice arrived, he greeted the Count in a professional manner. His subordinate and the figurehead of LPF, Gherita Zarfatti, skipped the greeting entirely. Arturo Azzurino saluted him like a loyal soldier and the Grandmaster of the Templar Knights Gina de Gioia bowed deeply in respect. All of them then gathered around a table and turned to look at Count Francis, who nervously took a deep breath.\n\n"A-as you know, I-I am determ-mined t-to not c-continue my p-predecessor's-"\n"Excuse me, your Grace," Arturo said, "But could you speak a little clearer? I'm struggling to understand what you're saying."\nGherita chuckled while Vittorio and the Grandmaster gave judgemental looks to the general. Francis seemed to shrink in size but managed to keep himself together. "I-I'll try my b-best to be clear, general. As I w-was saying, from now on the Fr-rancistrian military will be f-focused on defending its b-borders. It is up to y-you to decide how exactly our n-nation will be defended."\n\nWhile Gherita seemed to completely disagree with the entire decision and left the room in protest, the other officers remained and began to discuss. Vittorio Felice proclaimed that an aggressive defence would be ideal, with the use of overwhelming firepower and decisive counter-offensives. The Grandmaster argued that patience was key, and having extensive plans for every possible scenario would make sure they'd be ready to oppose any kind of attack on their nation. Arturo Azzurino seemed to be indifferent on the matter.\n\nThe Governor-General and the Grandmaster could not come to an agreement, and ultimately it was once again up to the Count to have the final say."

 francistria.12.d:0 "A train arrived at Karthin's central rail station, carrying an important visitor from the north. The Count of Francistria, Francis IX, had arrived for a diplomatic meeting with the King, escorted by his court and the Knights of the Temple who functioned as his bodyguards. His Majesty Garibald Talonuel was waiting for him at the station and welcomed him to the capital in a lavish ceremony. The Count hesitantly shook the King's claw and soon enough the two were travelling to the King's palace by car.\n\nAfter various other ceremonies and formalities, the two monarchs were finally in private in the King's personal chambers. Garibald clasped his claws, his formal and gentle look being replaced by a more stern one.\n"Count Francis, the news from your country which have come to my attention make me concerned. Dismissing our advisors, nationalizing our assets and so forth. At least you had the decency to meet me and discuss this serious matter in person."\nThe Count gulped nervously. He hadn't met the King before, and wasn't sure what to expect. "Y-your majesty, it was n-never my intent to in-insult Wingbardy or i-its griffons. As you m-may know, the i-influence of your c-companies and advisors simply g-grew too great, becoming d-detrimental to our own d-development. I strong-gly believe t-that Franc-Franc-Franc-- E-excuse me, sir..."\nGaribald's expression softened. "It is fine. I understand. Count Francis, the houses of Talonuel and Martlewing have always been friends. I do not intend for this to change. But I also see that your nation has grown far too reliant on our aid."\nFrancis nodded, happy that he understood him and that he didn't have to explain himself more.\n"However, I must admit I am offended and disappointed of how your government has resolved the matter. If you had acted with more deliberation, discussing the problem with us, then perhaps we could've figured out a solution together. Alas, you dealt with it yourself, damaging our relations and the prestige of Wingbardy."\nFrancis hung his head low in shame. "S-sorry, your ma-majesty. W-we will consult you in the f-future."\nGaribald smiled. "Apology accepted. I must say, you are far more humble than the previous Count. Now come, let us enjoy dinner and celebrate our friendship.""

ANG_filled_arsenals:0 "Griffing Arsenal"
ANG_filled_arsenals_desc:0 "Traditionally, the procurement of equipment for the Angriverian militias was done in partnership with privately owned industrial firms. While effective, it has come into question if these firms can be trusted in these politically trying times. As such, we have established the Griffing Arsenal, a state-run enterprise which will be responsible for producing arms, equipment, and munitions for the Angriverian army."
ANG_support_squads:0 "Enhance Infantry Formations"
ANG_support_squads_desc:0 "Developments across the globe have shown an increase in combat effectiveness when adding supporting companies onto traditional infantry divisions. By replicating the success of this onto our own armed forces we can expect them to perform better in engagements."
ANG_magical_infantry_focus:0 "Experimental Weaponry"
ANG_magical_infantry_focus_desc:0 "The recent discovery of Crystal reserves in Angelclaw have brought to our attention the possibility of developing a crystal-based infantry weapon. While developments in this field are largely experimental, and have proved only marginally successful, it's theorized that such weaponry could one day be highly effective in combat."
ANG_modern_knights:0 "Legacy of the Verlorene Hoffnungen"
ANG_modern_knights_desc:0 "The Verlorene Hoffnungen are an elite unit of knights within the Angriverian Army. Their roots date back to the Revolution of 978, when the Baron called upon his various petty nobles to come to his aid. The unit formed in response and it was due to their tremendous bravery that the war was won by imperial forces. However, the knights are now in dire need of fresh blood, improved equipment, and updated doctrine."
ANG_special_forces:0 "Angriverian Special Forces"
ANG_special_forces_desc:0 "Across the globe, developments in training and doctrine have created a series of niche roles for specialized infantry formations. These include units trained for combat in mountains, units designed to be dropped behind enemy lines, and units tasked with assaulting objectives during a naval landing. This level of specialisation could be highly beneficial to our cause."
ANG_artillery_modernization:0 "Modernize our Batteries"
ANG_artillery_modernization_desc:0 "The Republican Revolution proved the ineffectiveness of our artillery in combat, with our big guns performing especially poorly. This can be mostly attributed to the use of antique muzzle-loaded cannons rather than breach-loaded pieces. While this problem has been somewhat mitigated there are still great strides to be made in the development and implementation of artillery technology."
ANG_radio_towers:0 "Equestrian Witchcraft"
ANG_radio_towers_desc:0 "The engineers of Equestria have developed a new piece of technology known as RADAR. While initially used for the tracking of commercial planes, the technology can be adapted to spot enemy aircraft from incredible distances, allowing for them to be intercepted far more effectively. While this technology will not be cheap to import, it's importance in national security can not be understated."
ANG_computing_experiments:0 "Equestrian Wizardry"
ANG_computing_experiments_desc:0 "The engineers of Equestria have developed a new piece of technology known as a computer. Its purpose was initially as a simple counting machine, designed to aid scientists with cumbersome mathematics. However, the technology has shown some promise in the world of espionage, with the ability to assist code breakers and secure our own lines of communication."
ANG_rocket_artillery_effort:0 "Diversifying our Firepower"
ANG_rocket_artillery_effort_desc:0 "Recently developments within the field of rocketry have allowed for smaller engines, greater effectiveness, higher reliability, and the ability to hold larger payloads. As such, the Angriverian Army has begun to look into the possibility of weaponizing rockets, using them to augment our traditional artillery batteries."
ANG_army_motorization:0 "The Grifftruck"
ANG_army_motorization_desc:0 "The Grifftruck is a rugged and reliable vehicle, designed by the engineers of Griffenheim to endure the rugged, barren, and chilly climate of Griffonia. Since its inception, the truck has become popular throughout the Empire's lands, with licenses being snapped up across the various Imperial entities. The inclusion of this truck within our armed forces would greatly increase their maneuverability and speed."
ANG_proper_tanks:0 "Import Imperial Designs"
ANG_proper_tanks_desc:0 "Recently, the Imperial Army has begun to develop armoured fighting vehicles. These tanks, as they are called, are heavily armoured and can easily counter our infantry formations. The inclusion of a small number of tanks to support infantry, or a large number to act as independent combat units, would greatly increase the effectiveness of our army."
ANG_inspired_army:0 "A Defensive Army"
ANG_inspired_army_desc:0 "The new Angriverian army has been built upon the traditions of old, with a heavy focus on the supremacy of entrenched defensive positions in our doctrine. The goal of the Angriverian Army is to form a strong bulwark against foreign invasion via the rapid mobilisation of our army into strong fortified positions."
ANG_superior_army:0 "An Offensive Army"
ANG_superior_army_desc:0 "While our army has traditionally fought on the defensive, recent developments in technology and doctrine have allowed us to seize the initiative. Our armoured spearheads will pierce the enemy's ranks with the support of our advanced artillery, opening holes in the line which are newly formed motorized battalions can exploit. This is how a modern army was meant to operate."
ANG_military_academy:0 "Found The Institute of Military Affairs"
ANG_military_academy_desc:0 "The Institute of Military Affairs, or IMA, has been established within the city Appengen. The mission of this institution is to train a future generation of officers, house the Angriverian Army's newly formed general staff, and develop doctrine on both the tactical and strategic level."

ANG_air_stuff:0 "Flying High"
ANG_air_stuff_desc:0 "Griffons were born to fly, to pierce the sky and enjoy true freedom. But despite the abilities granted by our wings, the limitations of biology have always prevented us from soaring too fast or too high. But with the latest innovations in airframes, we can shatter those limits, and griffonkind will know fewer limits in the sky than ever before."
ANG_fighter_projects:0 "Wings of Steel"
ANG_fighter_projects_desc:0 "Our current airframes are laughably outdated, and our first step in achieving dominance of the sky once more should be to update our fighter models. We have little to be concerned about from enemy planes if our fighters simply rip them to shreds after all."
ANG_doctrinal_development:0 "High Altitude Training"
ANG_doctrinal_development_desc:0 "Despite being more naturally suited to the skies than most species, excessive altitudes can still heavily hamper a griffon pilots capabilities in the field. By training our pilots at these extreme altitudes we can gradually wean them to the massive heights that they will have to endure as professional pilots, granting us a tactical advantage over our enemies."
ANG_actual_air_bases:0 "The Appengen Airfields"
ANG_actual_air_bases_desc:0 "While airplanes were never particularly popular in Angriver, there was the odd griffon known to own a plane back in the day. A defunct aerodrome now sits in Appengen, and its location makes it perfect to establish a new airfield upon. Our planes are little more than steel deathtraps with no place to land after all."
ANG_strat:0 "Strategic Bomber Effort"
ANG_strat_desc:0 "By striking our enemies critical wartime industries, we can potentially rob them of their abilities to supply their troops in the field with equipment. As the most critical industries are often the most well-guarded ones, a specialized type of bomber will have to be developed to carry and drop the bombs on our enemies industrial centres."
ANG_tact:0 "Tactical Bomber Effort"
ANG_tact_desc:0 "Why fire guns at our enemies from the ground when we can simply blow them up from the sky? By developing new tactical bombers to destroy enemy forces we can significantly damage our enemies divisions before they have a chance to engage with our ground troops."
ANG_napalm:0 "Napalm"
ANG_napalm_desc:0 "Napalm has proven itself to be a particularly useful tool during wartime. Burning at the same temperature as gasoline and for far longer intervals, as well as sticking tenaciously to its targets. This substance is almost perfect for its usage in payloads for our bombers, serving as a perfect weapon to use against structures and infantry."
ANG_CAS_projects:0 "Claws of Iron"
ANG_CAS_projects_desc:0 "Though they may lack the heavier payloads of our tactical bombers, our close air support frames still serve a vital role in our combat operations. By attacking and destroying smaller targets of opportunity during battle, close air support can easily turn the tide of battle if used properly."
ANG_heavy_fighter_projects:0 "Guarding Our Skies"
ANG_heavy_fighter_projects_desc:0 "In order to provide an effective escort for our strategic bombers, a new design of fighter must be developed. Sporting heavier armaments and being all around heavier and less agile than a regular fighter, these planes can comfortably escort our bombers and will prove a  tough foe to all enemy interceptors seeking to destroy our bombers."
ANG_rocket_projects:0 "Rocketry Projects"
ANG_rocket_projects_desc:0 "While many consider them a novelty of warfare, rockets hold immense potential both as a means of propelling our aircraft and as a weapon in and of themselves. Investing in testing sites and new rocket designs is only prudent at this point."
ANG_paratrooper_project:0 "The Screaming Eagles"
ANG_paratrooper_project_desc:0 "Jumping from altitudes that even the bravest griffons would have considered insane only a few years ago, our elite paratroopers can handily land behind enemy lines to cause havoc. And as their equipment gets more sophisticated, their potential strategic and tactical uses increase as well."
ANG_expanded_bases:0 "Expand the Appengen Air Fields"
ANG_expanded_bases_desc:0 "To meet the demands of our expanding air force, and to provide the necessary capacity for further expansion, the already sizable airfields at Appengen must be expanded once more."
ANG_jet_fighters:0 "The V-1 Jet Fighter"
ANG_jet_fighters_desc:0 "After multiple prototypes and false-starts, the first ever viable model for a jet-powered fighter produced by our designers approaches. With even more investment we can enter into a new age of aviation, flying planes at speeds that would make the common griffon speechless."

ANG_industrial_stuff:0 "Salvage the Economy"
ANG_industrial_stuff_desc:0 "The economy of Angriver is at a pitiful state, with years of neglect and the presence of the many bandits and brigands having relegated us to the very bottom of the economic ladder. Indeed even amongst the other nations of Herzland, we come up pitifully short. The future of Angriver looks very dark indeed if we are unable to save it from this economic slump."
ANG_clearing_out_shitforest:0 "Reclaiming The Scheißwald"
ANG_clearing_out_shitforest_desc:0 "Much of Angriver is covered in forest and is thus unusable for development. Mass deforestation will allow us to clear out new land for farms, pastures and towns and will give us timber for export. And nobody liked the grim bandit-filled forests anyway."
ANG_electronics_research:0 "Electronic Experiments"
ANG_electronics_research_desc:0 "Electronics have proven themselves to be vital to any modern state. Indeed electricity has transformed nearly every facet of daily life, and nations are quickly making advancements in the field. If we are to ever reach the same heights as the economic powerhouses of Griffonia an investment in the development of our own electronics would not be unwise."
ANG_farmland:0 "Expanding the Farms"
ANG_farmland_desc:0 "Vast areas of Herzland are not exploited to their full potential as farms. By expanding existing farms and sponsoring the construction of new ones we can greatly increase the food supply of Angriver, and well-fed griffons are happy griffons."
ANG_country_roads:0 "Railroads Across the Nation"
ANG_country_roads_desc:0 "Locomotives are finally starting to appear in Angriver, and the economic potential of these massive machines is undeniable. By laying railroads through the newly deforested areas we can encourage the usage and development of the plains of Angriver. This will also enable our military to move across the nation much faster than before."
ANG_green_gold:0 "Blue Gold"
ANG_green_gold_desc:0 "A large vein of magical crystals has been discovered in Angriver, and currently lies unexploited. Extracting these crystals would require relatively little effort and the potential military applications of these crystals is enormous."
ANG_magic_boosts:0 "Magical Investments"
ANG_magic_boosts_desc:0 "The applications of magic in our industries have yet to be fully explored. Using magic to supplement our industrial base has the potential to provide massive boons across every sector of the economy, and we would be fools to ignore such potential."
ANG_mining:0 "Expanding the Mines"
ANG_mining_desc:0 "With the potential application of the magical crystals discovered in Angriver becoming more clear by the day, the true importance of this resource has started to reveal itself. Expanding the mines to fully exploit the veins that we have located within our territory should be our top priority."
ANG_power_of_the_gods:0 "The Power of the Gods"
ANG_power_of_the_gods_desc:0 "The recent discovery of magical crystals in Angriver has attracted many magical scientists to our capital, and through their collective work, we have caught a glimpse of the true power that lies within the crystals. While their theories have yet to be tested, the economic and military potential in these crystals is staggering."
ANG_connect_the_nation:0 "Connecting the Nation"
ANG_connect_the_nation_desc:0 "The state of the road system in Angriver is, to put it bluntly, abysmal. The vast expanses between the major population centres of Angriver are filled with roads that have not received maintenance in decades, and some areas only have dirt paths to guide travel. Modernizing and repairing the road system should be one of the first things that we do if we seek to save the economy."
ANG_griffing_industry:0 "Attract Heavy Industries"
ANG_griffing_industry_desc:0 "Angriver has never attracted much attention from investors, due to the little attention paid by the state to its industrial sector. But if we offer some generous benefits to potential investors Angriver would suddenly look a lot more attractive to prospective factory owners."
ANG_dierhoven_steel_mills:0 "New Steel Mills in Dierhoven"
ANG_dierhoven_steel_mills_desc:0 "Dierhoven is a growing town near our southern border, close to the southern edge of Scheißwald. Its location allows trade with large foreign cities such as Verenia and Griffonstone, but so far they have lacked a trade good to sell. By clearing forest and making charcoal, they will have plentiful fuel for new forges and mills that will refine ore into valuable steel and copper."
ANG_educate_the_people:0 "Educating the People"
ANG_educate_the_people_desc:0 "If we are to acquire a truly modern economy, the plague of illiteracy that has infested Angriver since time immemorial must be eradicated. We shall expand the educational system by providing generous benefits to schools, be they public or private, and by creating night schools for workers that desire to learn how to read."
ANG_our_own_oil_company:0 "Attracting Oil Companies"
ANG_our_own_oil_company_desc:0 "With Angriver becoming more industrialized by the day, the lack of oil in our territories has started to constrain our industrial expansion. To solve this problem we have made generous offers to several oil companies looking to establish refineries in Griffonia, the only thing left to do is finalizing the agreement."
ANG_arms_industry:0 "An Arms Industry of our Own"
ANG_arms_industry_desc:0 "Angriver has never sported a large number of military factories, with its army never truly needing a large number of weapons. But as we move into a new age of warfare, it has become clear that we need to expand our industrial capacity to meet the demands of a modern army."
ANG_automobile_industry:0 "Expanding Rubin Automobile"
ANG_automobile_industry_desc:0 "Rubin Automobile is one of the exceptionally rare companies founded in Angriver that is truly successful. Their cars have proven to be well designed and reliable, and they are currently seeking funding to expand their production to a new level. If we were to provide this funding we could secure a steady source of trucks for our military to use."
ANG_science_base_improvement:0 "A Modern Scientific Base"
ANG_science_base_improvement_desc:0 "Thanks to the recent strides that we have taken in the economy, we have found ourselves able to expand the research and development efforts of our scientists. While this investment will not put us at equal status with the scientific powerhouses of the world, it will bring us closer to having a modern science base."
ANG_land_grants:0 "Land Grants for Farmers"
ANG_land_grants_desc:0 "There are enormous barely settled areas of Angriver that have the potential to make for great farmland if exploited. By offering this land for a pittance to farmers looking to strike out for their own we can attract a large number of new immigrants. Not only will this increase the tax revenues that we collect, but many new griffons of military age will also immigrate to the nation."
ANG_village_education:0 "Village Education"
ANG_village_education_desc:0 "There are still many villages that lack any sort of educational facility, and thus a large number of our citizens are unable to fully realize their potential in society. We shall establish a special programme aimed at finally bringing proper education to these villages, and in doing so we shall be rid of the last traces of the illiteracy that once plagued our nation."
ANG_national_bank:0 "The National Bank of Angriver"
ANG_national_bank_desc:0 "Angriver has no central bank, as it has never needed one in the past due to its poor economic base. But with the recent strides we have made in the industrial sector the lack of such a bank has started to constrict our further development. By establishing such a bank we will be one step closer to a truly modern economy."
ANG_industrial_projects:0 "Heavy Industrial Projects"
ANG_industrial_projects_desc:0 "There is still more land that lies unused for any industrial purpose in Angriver. More factories can still be constructed, and the existing ones can still be further expanded. We are so close to eliminating the economic woes that have plagued us for so long, we cannot stop now."
ANG_new_economy:0 "The Curse Broken"
ANG_new_economy_desc:0 "Factories now litter the landscape of Angriver, producing products that are loaded onto trains for transport across the whole continent. Only a few years ago such an image would have seemed preposterous to any griffon. After an immense amount of effort, we have finally managed to break the economic curse that has plagued Angriver for decades."

ANG_navy_stuff:0 "Founding a Navy"
ANG_navy_stuff_desc:0 "For the first time in our nation's history we have claimed coastline, the vast and terrifying ocean finally within our sight. Many threats lurk beyond the horizon, and we must prepare for their arrival and build ships of war. The locals will be able to aid us in this effort."
ANG_base_strike_f:0 "Strike at the Heart"
ANG_base_strike_f_desc:0 "The core of our enemies will not always be vulnerable to a direct attack. Often a nation's true naval strength lies not directly in its navy, but in the ports and dockyards which supply and repair it. But through the use of carriers and submarines, we can deliver crippling blows to this critical portion of our foes industry, while protecting our own."
ANG_carrier_f:0 "Carrier Experiments"
ANG_carrier_f_desc:0 "Carriers have the potential to completely revolutionise naval warfare. Through the combined might of the navy and the airforce, almost limitless tactical and strategic possibilities present themselves. But before any of that can be done, we need to actually develop a solid carrier model."
ANG_navy_planes_f:0 "Naval Aviation"
ANG_navy_planes_f_desc:0 "To deal with the unique challenges that come with carrier-based operations, new models and designs of planes must be developed. With each improvement to our carrier-based planes the strategic potential of our carriers increased, we would truly be mad to ignore this avenue of advancement."
ANG_fleet_being_f:0 "A Show of Force"
ANG_fleet_being_f_desc:0 "Our ports are the most critical part of our naval strength, as without them our navy would not last long unsupplied. By constructing a fleet focused on large battleships we can simply intimidate the enemy fleets, forcing them to stay away from our home waters while we build up the navy. And a few battleships certainly wouldn't hurt the national pride either."
ANG_dockyards:0 "A Home Port"
ANG_dockyards_desc:0 "To fuel our newly established naval efforts, a true home port is required. By constructing several new dockyards we can meet the demand for our navy, and provide a new destination for trade to arrive in our nation."
ANG_battlecruiser_f:0 "Bigger Ships"
ANG_battlecruiser_f_desc:0 "In order to stay competitive with the navies of other nations, we must constantly develop and expand our hulls. Bigger is better as they say, and we can certainly go bigger than our current models."
ANG_light_cruiser_f:0 "Light Cruisers"
ANG_light_cruiser_f_desc:0 "In order to meet the ever more stringent demands of our navy, our light cruiser models must be improved. The armor and armaments of our current models can almost certainly be improved, and if we have to break a few naval treaties to accomplish this, so be it."
ANG_battleship_f:0 "Battleships"
ANG_battleship_f_desc:0 "The pride of every nation, building and designing a proper battleship is a truly daunting task. But with the ever-expanding naval capacity of our nation combined with the latest advancements in naval technology have now made this feasible. The time has come to construct a true flagship for our navy."
ANG_expand_dockyards:0 "Dockyard Expansion"
ANG_expand_dockyards_desc:0 "Our ever-expanding navy now devours resources and griffonpower at a steady rate, and to meet this massive new demand multiple new dockyards will be constructed. A navy cannot exist without dockyards after all."
ANG_marine_f:0 "Create a Marine Core"
ANG_marine_f_desc:0 "The nature of modern war has rendered amphibious operations a necessity. Rather than throwing our normal forces at the beaches untrained and unready for their task, we shall create a new arm of the Navy specifically to deal with these landings, creating soldiers who can truly thrive in an amphibious environment."
ANG_transport_f:0 "Modern Transport Vessels"
ANG_transport_f_desc:0 "As our amphibious operations expand, the demand for new and better-equipped transport vessels does as well. By improving our existing designs we can deliver more soldiers to the battlefield faster and more efficiently than before."
ANG_trade_indirection_f:0 "Striking at the Lifelines"
ANG_trade_indirection_f_desc:0 "Against a truly overwhelming opponent, we cannot risk a direct confrontation. But the latest advancements in submarine technology provide another option. By constructing a large fleet of submarines and through developing new tactics based around these submarines we can simply cut off all trade to our enemies. A massive navy is of little use when there is no oil to fuel it after all."
ANG_destroyer_f:0 "Patrol Boats"
ANG_destroyer_f_desc:0 "Not every task requires the biggest guns in the navy. Patroling the coastline and supporting the larger ships are roles that are much better filled with smaller ships. By leveraging their small size and ease of production our destroyers might be able to punch above their weight class."
ANG_submarine_f:0 "U-Boat Experiments"
ANG_submarine_f_desc:0 "The potential to strike our enemies ships unseen, hunting their fleets across the oceans and waiting for the perfect moment to strike, is truly tantalizing. By conditioning new designs of submarines, we can better realize this potential."

ANG_open_borders_desc:0 "War, war never changes. It ruins our lives and turns our homes to rubble, those who escape it find no solace as borders are closed. But we must help these downtrodden griffs, for we have spare excess and can help. So why not do so?"
ANG_our_homeland:0 "Home of the Brave"
ANG_our_homeland_desc:0 "Angriver, the home of the free and home of the brave. Where the people are happy, where the poor do not starve and where all that want to work can find a job. The Claw is long gone, it's scars still last but we're done with them. Othmar has done a good job."

ANG_anarchism:0 "Anarchy in Angriver"

ANG_local_councils:0 "Confederacy of Communes"
ANG_local_councils_desc:0 "The Barons always ruled over the municipalities of Angriver with an iron claw, refusing to let them have any freedoms.

ANG_farms_for_the_farmers_desc:0 "Over the years the upper class hoarded vast tracts of land, claiming to own it all and demanding that serfs on their soil pay with tax or labour. No more! The land belongs to all of us! Rural communes shall work together to farm the land and share the produce with each other. Land cannot be owned by any single griffon, we all need it to survive. No more shall griffons hunger because of greed of others."
ANG_worker_control:0 "Seize the Means of Production"
ANG_worker_control_desc:0 "The anarchist revolution will now come from the countryside into the cities and towns where the industry of Angriver is located.

From each according to his ability and to each according to his needs!"
ANG_peoples_roads:0 "Connected Communes"
ANG_peoples_roads_desc:0 "During the Baron's rule the infrastructure on the countryside was completely neglected. Now communes, eager to build new roads to make trade with each other easier, are cooperating on several construction projects. One isolated small village in the eastern hills even asked for aid which is being provided by their neighbours, meaning even the poorest and tiniest commune in Angriver will be connected."
ANG_anarchist_society:0 "An Anarchist Society"
ANG_anarchist_society_desc:0 "The last traces of private property, currency, feudalism and capitalism have been erased from Angriver. We have achieved true anarcho-communism.

ANG_anarchist_education:0 "Communal Education"
ANG_anarchist_education_desc:0 "Teachers and scholars long complained of having low wages and barely making a living. Now they earn no money at all yet work more eagerly than ever.

Knowledge is shared freely and no one guards it jealously."
ANG_build_support:0 "Embracing Anarchy"
ANG_build_support_desc:0 "Many griffons in Angriver have been corrupted by statist ideals and have doubts about living in an anarchist society. We must educate them on the matter and show them that we only want to ensure freedom and well-being for all. We should also tell them that abolishing private property does not mean they can't have personal belongings any longer."
ANG_matters_of_faith:0 "No Masters, Only Gods"
ANG_matters_of_faith_desc:0 "Long have priests preached that the Gods above judge them and give them strict rules to obey, while filling their temples with unfathomable wealth. This must change. Gods are not cruel despots, but our creators, and love us like any parents would love their children. Temples will be stripped empty of excess and the age of dogmatism ended. The Gods may be worshipped freely, without rules or laws."
ANG_syndicates:0 "Workers' Syndicates"
ANG_syndicates_desc:0 "In an example of anarchist synthesis, syndicalist labour unions have formed and are rapidly gaining thousands of members.

ANG_hunting_the_bourgeoise_desc:0 "Long have we made use of the Propaganda of the Deed, carrying out assassinations and murders of hated bourgeois scum to incite revolutionary fervour.

ANG_the_baron_fate:0 "Death to the Despot!"
ANG_the_baron_fate_desc:0 "Years has Angriver suffered under Leer the Vicious, the cruelest ruler imaginable. He gave no mercy to others, so why should we give any to him? Let the power-hungry and violent lunatic squeal and whimper as we give him his rightful punishment."

ANG_confiscate_assets_desc:0 "The Barony used to own many buildings across the country, such as government palaces, manors, storages and workshops. Now that the state no longer exists, these buildings and assets belong to all. The bureaucrats and capitalists who stand in our way will be removed."
ANG_destroy_the_claw:0 "Crack the Claw"
ANG_destroy_the_claw_desc:0 "The Black Claw cannot be trusted. Who knows what they are conspiring in the shadows? They likely plot to strike and eradicate our democratic haven of equality.

ANG_local_units:0 "Communal Militia"
ANG_local_units_desc:0 "The brutal statist weapons of the army and lawkeepers have been taken care of. But we still need to take care of our defence in case a foreign invasion threatens our independence. Therefore communal militias are forming, looting the arsenals and training for combat. The militiagriffs are motivated, for they are not fighting for their oppressive leader or for money, but for their homes and families."
ANG_local_armories:0 "A Gun In Every Home"
ANG_local_armories_desc:0 "The only way to ensure liberty of all and prevent the resurgence of oppression is to arm every single griffon.

ANG_the_communard_army:0 "Scherler Column"
ANG_the_communard_army_desc:0 "While communal militias provide basic defence for the Confederacy, a proper centralized military unit might still be necessary. The militia units need to be organized under one red banner carried by the leader of the partisans, Scherler. It may not be a professional army but the loyalty and revolutionary fervour of its soldiers cannot be questioned."
ANG_the_battlecry_of_freedom:0 "Battlecry of Freedom"
ANG_the_battlecry_of_freedom_desc:0 "While the griffons of Angriver have been liberated, millions of others remain in chains, enslaved by their bourgeois and feudal masters.

ANG_the_march_of_progress:0 "The March of Progress"
ANG_the_march_of_progress_desc:0 "The economy of Angriver is in a truly pitiful state, and the National Republican party intends to improve it through a truly bold plan.

As Angriver cannot hope to achieve prosperity in these modern times without a modern industrial base."
ANG_rapid_industrialisation:0 "Rapid Industrialisation "
ANG_rapid_industrialisation_desc:0 "With massive subsidies for anyone willing to start a factory in Angriver, and generous private incentives from the party, Angriver has suddenly become a hotspot of industrialisation.

ANG_pumped_up:0 "Preparing for the Worst"
ANG_pumped_up_desc:0 "While Angriver now possesses a suitable industrial base, there is a distinct lack of any military production in the nation. To fix this, several deals have been made with prominent arms companies, exchanging massive tax breaks for the construction of new military factories."

ANG_stronghold_of_republicanism_desc:0 "Gerhard Bluhm and his National Republicans have captured the hearts of the people utterly.

ANG_new_officers:0 "New Officers"
ANG_new_officers_desc:0 "The forces of the revolution were mainly comprised of hastily organized militias and lacked a cohesive and coherent command structure and officer corps.

ANG_resurrect_republican_army_desc:0 "The forces of the Republican Army fought valiantly against the tyrannical armies of the Empire to the very last, and in so doing inspired countless others to rise up against tyranny.

ANG_proper_land_reform:0 "Proper Land Reform"
ANG_proper_land_reform_desc:0 "Land has never been properly distributed in Angriver, with most of it being owned by rich landowners or noble families. The Social Democrats intend to fix this historic injustice, but it is important to do so with the right methods. We must also address the inequalities that lead to this situation in the first place, and ensure that this reform is not carried out in a violent manner."
ANG_cooperate_with_syndicates:0 "Cooperation With the Syndicates"
ANG_cooperate_with_syndicates_desc:0 "While the syndicates and their anarchist allies did not secure ultimate control of Angriver, they are still a formidable force within the political landscape.

ANG_a_free_society:0 "A Free Society"
ANG_a_free_society_desc:0 "The Social Democrats intend to utterly transform the very fabric of society in Angriver, creating a truly free and just society in the process.

ANG_a_connected_nation:0 "A Connected Nation"
ANG_a_connected_nation_desc:0 "Angriver remains a disconnected nation, despite multiple attempts by the previous governments to bolster the infrastructure already present within the nation.

ANG_support_local_companies:0 "Support Local Companies"
ANG_support_local_companies_desc:0 "While the other parties might have courted the whims of large industries, the Social Democrats have always pledged their support to the smaller, more local, companies within Angriver.

ANG_hunt_down_the_claw_desc:0 "The Black Claw has been a thorn in the side of the people of Angriver for centuries, killing and terrorizing the populace with impunity.

ANG_weschler:0 "The Social Liberal Party Wins the Election"

ANG_safeguard_the_people:0 "Safeguard the People"
ANG_safeguard_the_people_desc:0 "If Angriver is to survive the coming conflicts, it must catch up to the rest of the world in the industrial sector. We cannot hope to defend ourselves if we are unable to maintain a balanced budget, or unable to produce the basic necessities for our people."
ANG_buyout_estates:0 "Buy the Estates"
ANG_buyout_estates_desc:0 "There are several large estates possessed by noble families that sit upon land that would be incredibly valuable to develop from an industrial standpoint. The simplest solution to a problem is often the best one, and purchasing these lands would be trivial."

ANG_use_the_land_desc:0 "With the land from the estates now firmly in government claws, we can grant several large companies the exclusive rights for these areas in exchange for the construction of factories and mines within Angriver. The people might complain a bit, but when has that gotten in the way of profit?"
ANG_angriverian_identity:0 "Angriverian Identity"
ANG_angriverian_identity_desc:0 "Angriver has never possessed a true national identity of its own, with most citizens simply identifying as members of the Empire. This cannot be allowed to continue, so a new national identity shall have to be created. The citizens of Angriver are truly exceptional after all, or at least that is what we need to convince them of."
ANG_urbanisation:0 "Urbanisation"
ANG_urbanisation_desc:0 "Angriver cannot continue existing as a society stuck in the past and due to this large portions of the population will have to be encouraged to move into the cites. There are simply more opportunities for the common citizen in the cities, and if that relegates the countryside to a backwater, so be it."
ANG_national_arms_industry:0 "The National Arms Industry"
ANG_national_arms_industry_desc:0 "Angriver does not currently possess the means to produce enough weapons to arm its army, and until we can meet this demand we will remain frightfully vulnerable to foreign aggression. Establishing more military factories should be a priority for our industrial developers."
ANG_an_industrious_nation:0 "An Industrious Society"
ANG_an_industrious_nation_desc:0 "Angriver has fully escaped its previous reputation of being the economic backwater of Griffonia.

ANG_river_forts:0 "River Forts"
ANG_river_forts_desc:0 "The river that runs through Angriver is perfectly suited for defence against any aggression from the empire. By supplementing the natural defence with forts we can create a defensive line that would require a massive force to surmount."
ANG_national_academia:0 "National Academia"
ANG_national_academia_desc:0 "Angriver has never housed a truly exceptional scientific base, but with the recent reforms, the region has become attractive to many scientists and researchers seeking a free society.

ANG_make_examples:0 "A Clear Example"

ANG_kill_the_rangers:0 "Butcher the Waldläufer"
ANG_kill_the_rangers_desc:0 "The Rangers are some of our most dangerous opponents. While their role in Angriver is clearly important for the functioning of the state, this does not give them licence to act against our interests or to even consider doing so.

ANG_crush_the_resistance:0 "Destroy the Resistance"
ANG_crush_the_resistance_desc:0 "The worst group of resisting griffons in Angriver are the ones who have espoused the values of republicanism and democracy.

ANG_the_secret_council:0 "The Camarilla"

ANG_the_claw_guard_desc:0 "What is a nation without an obedient armed force to enforce its will? The Black Guard shall be the official extension of the Claw, accepting all who respect their position in life. This is an another step in our layered plan to ensure complete control of Angriver."
ANG_gas_weapons:0 "Dirty Tactics"
ANG_gas_weapons_desc:0 "Fighting fair is only opening yourself for an inevitable counterattack. No, if we wish to secure our victory on the battlefield, we must use every method at our disposal.

ANG_hire_mercs:0 "Hire the Talon Mercenaries Company"
ANG_hire_mercs_desc:0 "Our forces could use a temporary bolster until we can secure sufficient numbers. We shall hire mercenaries from a particularly infamous company, noted for their brutal actions and complete disregard for the lives of civilians. Their assistance in subjugating the peasants will be well worth their price."
ANG_restore_feudalism:0 "The Return of Feudalism"
ANG_restore_feudalism_desc:0 "The peasants have forgotten who owns the land they work on.

They should be grateful we left them their lives and homes."
ANG_work_the_land:0 "Work the Land"

ANG_fill_the_mills:0 "Fill the Mills"
ANG_fill_the_mills_desc:0 "The council of nobles have expressed dismay at the current steel production numbers. It might be adequate now, but in the near future it will not be sufficient for our expansion plans. The solution lies within appropriating land from the serfs to construct more steel mills."
ANG_into_the_factories:0 "Into the Factories"
ANG_into_the_factories_desc:0 "Our state of the art factories are a marvel of industrial progress - but we do not have enough workers to fill every position! Apparently, lack of willing griffons is attributed towards miserly paychecks and poor safety codes. This is completely unacceptable, the hirelings should be grateful we are offering them work in the first place! We require full industrial output by any means necessary."
ANG_skull_roads:0 "Cut Our Path"
ANG_skull_roads_desc:0 "The roads and highways of Angriver have remained bare for many decades now, and this simply cannot continue. Press-gang as many serfs into service as needed so that they can construct adequate infrastructure. Anygriff who complains is to be shot for disobeying his superiors."
ANG_ruthless_industry:0 "Heartless Industrialism"
ANG_ruthless_industry_desc:0 "The bloody business of war requires many firearms. Our current production is simply not enough to fulfill our demands, and this means an another wave of industrialisation is in order.

ANG_testing_the_limits:0 "Limitless Potential"

ANG_release_the_hounds:0 "Release the Hounds"
ANG_release_the_hounds_desc:0 "The vile Republicans were scattered after their defeat at the claws of the Baron's loyal soldiers, and now lie hidden across Angriver, waiting for the next moment to strike.

ANG_teach_them_a_lesson:0 "A Lesson In Fear"
ANG_teach_them_a_lesson_desc:0 "The Baron's soldiers will flood across Angriver like a wave of fire, destroying everything that stands in their way.

angriver.1.d:0 "The forests of Angriver have acted as a natural deterrent from settlement since time immemorial. The all-encompassing Scheißwald having proven to be less than ideal for settlement. But all things must come to an end, and the Scheißwald has slowly but surely started to shrink. With each passing day more trees fall, more space is cleared, and more griffons move in. Small settlements slowly grow prosperous, increasing immigration to Angriver as free griffons look for a place to seek an honest living in Griffonia. These settlements and their accompanying settlers have a frontier spirit of sorts, and nothing seems to be able to stop their expansion."
angriver.1.a:0 "That's great to hear."

angriver.2.t:0 "Mysterious Sickness"
angriver.2.d:0 "Mining has quickly become one of the most lucrative industries within Angriver, as the demand for the magical crystals recently discovered within the region seems unquenchable. But it seems that these crystals might not have been the boon that they initially appeared to be, as a strange sickness has started to spread amongst the miners. This mysterious disease seems to strike healthy griffons without warning, and panic has started to spread amongst the miners.\n\nThe issue was brought to a head when a number of miners were trapped stuck within a crystal mine after a cave in. When they escaped a scant 18 hours later everything seemed fine, but soon after the sickness made its presence known. The survivors started to become fatigued and soon started to bleed. Their condition quickly deteriorated until they were seemingly possessed by some dark force, their limbs moving erratically while they begged incoherently for help. They were put out of their misery soon after."
angriver.2.a:0 "Could the uranium be the cause of this?"

angriver.3.t:0 "Urbanisation"
angriver.3.d:0 "With the recent expansion of the road system, the cities of Angriver have become attractive to industrialists looking to establish new industrial factories. With these factories come jobs, and griffons are now moving into cities by the thousands to work in the factories. Slowly but surely money, services, wealth and opportunities are centralized within the cities, and griffons from the countryside come to seek their fortune.  This rapid change has devastated some of the poor farming communities of Angriver, with many towns losing their youngest generations to the cities with frightening ease. In a few years, many of these towns will become abandoned. Their residents having left for the cities, leaving only broken homes and the relics of the past behind them."
angriver.3.a:0 "Good to hear."

angriver.4.t:0 "Education Campaign"
angriver.4.d:0 "Illiteracy has long plagued the people of Angriver, as for a long time being literate provided no real benefit to the common griffon. But as modernity encroaches upon Angriver, the problem has become too large to ignore. The state has started a large programme aimed at eliminating illiteracy once and for all, and the fruits of this labor have begun to make themselves apparent. Mandatory schooling has finally been introduced, and night schools are provided at a low expense to workers willing to achieve literacy. This has proven to be a great benefit to our industrial sector as well as our research and development programs, as literate griffons are much more valuable workers than illiterate ones."
angriver.4.a:0 "The fight continues."

angriver.5.t:0 "Education Campaign Finished"
angriver.5.d:0 "Angriver has truly been transformed, as for the first time in the history of the region the majority of the population can safely be called literate. The battle was long and hard, requiring a large investment from the government.

These new settlers have expanded the small settlements already present in the countryside, and some are even projecting that new cities will soon start to sprout up in the countryside."
angriver.6.a:0 "Great!"

angriver.7.t:0 "Hit and Run"
angriver.7.d:0 "With the recent roadwork going around Angriver, it was inevitable that the occupants of the Scheißwald would be disturbed. One of the villages near the forest had become a hotbed of unnatural activity during the construction. Villagers started to disappear in the middle of the night, the only clue as to their fates being bloody scraps of clothing on the edges of the forest. Reports of unnatural noises during the night created mass paranoia, and the villagers started to have nightmares every single night.\n\nThe town was paralyzed by fear, and many thought that they would die at the claws of this terrible monster. The source of all of these problems was a Lychen, which had been sneaking into the village to indulge its appetite for weeks. Then, after feeding on the terror of the villagers, it intended to consume every living thing in the village. During the night, it creeped out of the forest, approaching the perfect spot to begin its dark ritual. It stood unmoving in the darkness of the night and prepared for its ultimate victory.\n\nThen it was hit by a truck. Kunz Bartram had been on a routine trip to the village, looking to take a census of the surrounding region, and as he was running behind schedule he had decided to take an overnight trip to the village to save some time. He had also decided to start his trip right after consuming a copious amount of imperial beer. Needless to say, this was not a recipe for responsible driving.\n\nDue to a combination of low visibility, inebriation and a lack of sleep, Kunz proceeded to drive into the Lychen, or to be more accurate he drove over it. Due to a snag on the creatures frayed clothing, the Lychen was then attached to the underside of the truck. The poor creature was then dragged with his truck to the village, and due to his less than stable driving, what arrived at the village more resembled a bloody smear than a Lychen. \n\nWhen Kunz Finally arrived, he was declared the savior of the village by the townsfolk, and graciously accepted his reward in the form of more imperial beer for the road."

angriver.9.d:0 "Yesterday morning, representatives from the Griffing Commune contacted the Zentralbank to demand the immediate relinquishment of its reserves. The demand was refused, at which point Kommunardarmee forces were dispatched to take possession of the bank's funds, by force if necessary. By the time they arrived, the bank's employees had barricaded themselves inside the building and prepared for a siege, having been reinforced by armed reactionary troublemakers.\n\nA tense standoff extended throughout the day, with neither side wanting to ignite the powder keg. Ultimately those inside the Zentralbank made the first move, attempting to escape with what gold they could carry under cover of darkness. They were discovered and a bloody firefight ensued, with heavy casualties being inflicted on both sides, but in the end all opposition was pacified and the Kommunardarmee seized control of the bank and its wealth. Confiscated funds were distributed without delay to the grateful population, which has given us a healthy boost in popularity."

While the anarchists were defeated along with the Republicans, the so-called Free State Army has continued to strike from the shadows ever since their defeat. The Free Army has recently escalated its attacks, and we seem as powerless as ever to stop them.\n\nPatrols from the military have started to disappear as of late, their mangled bodies found weeks later stripped of all valuable equipment. Several officers have been lost to car bombs and poison. This recent spurt of activity came to a head with a recent raid on a lightly defended armory, which proved disastrous for us. The entire garrison was slaughtered, and the weapons of the armory were all taken by the Free State Army. "

angriver.18.t:0 "Mysterious Murders"
angriver.18.d:0 "Dark clouds have gathered over Angriver as of late, with the populace living in constant fear and paranoia, many expecting that their next day may very well be their last. This atmosphere of terror was started by a string of mysterious murders. No griffon seemed to be immune, nobody was safe, anyone from the owner of a prestigious company to a lowly beggar could be next. The victim would simply disappear without a trace one day, with no clues as to what may have happened to them. \n\nThe bodies always surface sometime later, with some unfortunate griffon discovering a grisly scene without warning. The hardest part is always identifying the body, or whatever is left of it. There is no way to determine a cause of death for the victims, as many seem to have been torn apart limb from limb, or killed in such a brutal way that barely anything remains to examine. The bodies themselves would appear in seemingly any location, with the most audacious one being discovered inside a cell within the headquarters of the police. With no leads the police have been unable to do anything about the murders beyond telling every griffon to maintain constant vigilance, and the government itself seems powerless against this unseen threat."

And now the brigands of Angriver have a name to fear, Großmarschall Othmar Stoiber. The Großmarschall has launched an incredibly effective campaign against the vile criminals of the region, with police raids on bandit strongholds and army attacks on monster nests occurring almost daily. The Großmarschall himself has enjoyed a massive boost in popularity with the common folk, and its hard to find a griffon with a negative opinion of the Großmarschall within Angriver."

angriver.20.t:0 "Republicanism on the Rise"
angriver.20.d:0 "Many years ago, during the Republican Revolution of 978, Angriver was plunged into chaos as the Republicans, Anarchists and Loyalists openly fought in the streets. But the revolutionary rabble was ultimately defeated, their ideals crushed, and the old order firmly secured by Baron Leer's decisive leadership during the crisis. With their Republic relegated to a bunch of bandits hiding in the mountains, and with an emperor securely sitting on the throne in Griffenheim, the few remaining Republicans abandoned their ideals, leaving nothing but shattered tricolours and broken dreams behind them.\n\nMany thought that this would mark the end of the Republican menace in Angriver. They were wrong. It seems that the Republican ideals so cherished by the rabble did not die all those years ago. Like an infection, they have slowly grown in the shadows. This slow growth has finally reached a tipping point, and tricolours once again openly fly amongst the populace. The mob calls out for revolution, and it may only be a short time before their wish is granted."

Their aim is to wrest control of Angriver away from the Baron and deliver it to the Republicans on the silver platter. The first attacks soon commence, with makeshift bombs going off in the barracks of the army, and militias moving to secure key government institutions. The fighting starts soon after. The garrison is bloodied, but they are better equipped and trained than the republican militia. The streets are consumed with a steel storm of gunfire, punctuated by large explosions rolling in the distance. As the Republicans move to attack the headquarters of the militia, the garrison moves to defend it. The fate of Angriver now rests on a knife-edge, and any faction could walk away victorious this night."

But the location of the Großmarschall remains unknown to them, and they would surely panic if they knew where he was. Großmarschall Othmar Stoiber sits in the command seat of a tank, one of the few present in Angriver, and rides through the streets of Griffing with his personal guard and whatever other loyalist remnants he could gather in tow. Their destination is the headquarters of the Republicans, containing their officers and leaders. The complex itself is built like a fort and is well defended. \n\nThe Großmarschall intends to wipe out the leadership of the traitors with a single decapitation strike, aiming to inspire the crestfallen loyalists in the same act. As his forces reach the entrance to the Republican headquarters, the militia readies to attack his forces. The Großmarschall draws a sword and steps out of his tank. He intends to charge the headquarters of the traitors head-on with his men, their chances of success are slim. Whatever fate is ahead of him, the Großmarschall will meet it head-on."

But the ultimate fate of Angriver has yet to be decided, as the rebels who overthrew the old government are far from united. The revolution was broadly carried out by two factions. These two factions now wage an invisible war of influence, both sides seeking to take absolute control of the revolutionary forces, while sideling the desires of the other faction.\n\nFirstly, there is the National Republican Party lead by Gerhard Bluhm. The NRP is the local branch of the leading party of the Griffonian Republic and is comprised of a broad coalition of various democratic ideologies. The National Republican party advocates for a free and democratic society, with the various parties that make up the faction intending to run for office once elections are in place.\n\nThen, there are the Anarchists lead by Willie Scherler. The Anarchists have been waging a guerrilla war against the government for decades, and their forces comprise a large amount of the revolutionary militias. They intend to turn Angriver into an Anarchist paradise, one that is ready to defend itself at any cost.\n\nAs the shadow war rages on, no griffon could say with absolute clarity which faction would triumph. Once again the fate of Angriver rests on the whims of fate."

angriver.26.t:0 "The Grand Conspiracy"
angriver.26.d:0 "The black dawn has risen on the sky as the rangers begin have arrived back with news, they say the scouts are missing and the reinforcements sent after them to help have been found gutted and marked in the forest. The symbol of the Black Claw drawn in their entrails, yet more griffons lost to them. When Othmar hears of this he feels nothing but rage, his hatred for the Black Claw was known to all who ever had spoke even a word with him, it haunted his mind and he was never able to sleep well at night. Any noise would wake him, was it a Claw assassin sent to finally end him? Or just a creak of wood.. \n\nAnd so he began a new campaign against them, they struck in the darkness and hid in plain sight, if it worked so well for them why wouldn't it for him? And his little birds soon came back with news of what they heard, the noblegriffs speaking in hushed tones within their chambers, the hushed conspiracies shared between the blue blood aristocracy who oh so despised Othmar, it came as a shock at first, but then the rage began. These nobility had only what they were given to serve the people, yet here they were working to break the backs of the peasants who's shoulders carried them. \n\nHate, hate was all that Othmar felt as he told his griffons to round the nobility up, there would be no mercy for the wicked, he would teach these traitors what would happen to those who went against his back in such a way. It was a new type of anger, unknown to Othmar before. He had always hated the Black Claw but now he finally had faces to project this hatred towards, the killings the ceaseless murders, it all now had a face. \n\n The blue blood traitors found no solace in the news of trials for their actions, the judges had no pity nor mercy to give. With most either being sent to the darkest dankest cells of the dungeons or being executed outright. Othmar's fury got the best of him, hopefully it won't happen again."
angriver.26.a:0 "Where are the nobles? Oh, must be my imagination."

angriver.27.t:0 "The Ringleaders"
angriver.27.d:0 "Information from his network was fed back to Othmar in the weirdest ways. Scraps of paper covered in coded reports. Messages written on the insides of copper rings. Encrypted transmissions delivered through abandoned number-stations. He needed a Griffon tasked specifically with keeping track of it all. \nAt last, he's confident he has enough. \n\nThe Black Claw is notoriously secretive - it's how they avoided apprehension for so long. They are amazing at covering their tracks, at hiding identities, at avoiding capture. However, for every bit of secrecy the Claw had, Othmar had twice the will and resolve. \nIt was his mission from the moment he heard about them - from the moment he discovered they were real and dangerous, and not just ghosts and horror stories - to catch them. And Othmar didn't give up as easily as the ones that came before him. \n\nIt took a long time. He couldn't catch them through normal means - so he decided to bide his time. Send double-agents to join their criminal ranks. Keep track of them from afar. Let them get comfortable, let them think they were unstoppable. \n\nNow is time to strike. Now that they're weak, now that his griffons have managed to pry into every nook and cranny in their organization, now that he has a mountain of evidence on them big enough to take action. \nHe has everything he needs. Addresses, names, appearances, jobs, pawprints, locations. Every piece of the puzzle has been laid before him - it's time at last to solve it. To put the pieces together... and shatter the Black Claw. \n\nA whole platoon of rangers is ready to storm their hideouts and burrows with cuffs and batons as soon as he gives the order. They will all strike at midnight, when the criminals will be tired and weary from the day's atrocities. Once the court gives their verdicts, Angriver's prisons will be full with some of the most notorious criminals known to Griffonia. But by sunrise, when the mud hardens, the dust clears, and the wind ceases its howling... Angriver will be a smidge safer. \n\nJustice will rule tonight - and Othmar will hold her reins."

angriver.28.t:0 "A Meeting With Bluhm"
angriver.28.d:0 "Gerhard Bluhm is an interesting Griffon, to say the least. Othmar had met his fair share of warrior-spirits in the past, but nothing quite like the stout leader of the Republicans. Bluhm had that look in his eye, like he was always only an inch away from wanting to tear the Marshal's innards out. To put things simply - it was thought it'd be hard to convince him to come for some tea and a chat. \nIt surprised everyone when he accepted the invitation without any fuss or extra coaxing needed. \n\n"Good morning, Mister Othmar. Or, what should I call you? Your highness? Your greatness? Ruler?" his curt behaviour wasn't surprising, though, and neither was the fact he still had the murderous look in his eyes. \n\n"I see you're interested in skipping straight to business, then. Very well, I'll get us some tea, and then--" Othmar, in spite of everything, tried being amiable, still. \n\n"No, no tea," Bluhm insisted. "I didn't come here to waste time, your highness - my griffs are wilting away in your prisons as we speak, and I'm not one to enjoy jasmine tea while my countrybirds die for their beliefs. Unlike someone else, here." he answered, rudely. So much for trying to be friendly about it. \n\n"I expected polite conversation from an intelligent griffon - not wasting my time and oxygen listening to the same tripe I hear daily on the way to work." just like that, Othmar's niceness melted away, and Bluhm's bitter, disgusted glare was met with a stare equally violent. "So you either come down and collect yourself, or nothing gets solved today." \n\n"You are a traitor, Marshal Othmar." Bluhm cut in, harshly. "You are a killer of your own people - you are a tyrant." he continued, beak grit so hard his words came out muffled, forced. "You are all that is wrong with Angriver." \n\n"As if I could not say the exact same about you...!" Othmar snaps back, raising his tone, towering over the comparatively-smaller griffon. "Your people... your Republicans... you are all criminals! You have terrorized Angriver, you have shaken the country to its limits, all because we won't bow down to your definition of--" \n\n"You are a tyrant! None of this would've ever happened if griffons like you listened to the voice of the people!" Bluhm screams back at him. \n\n "And you are--" he pauses, suddenly, noticing something. Apparently, Bluhm pauses as well, not seizing the opportunity to attack. \n\nFor only a moment, Othmar could see something - beyond that look of hate and anger of the vilest kind, he could see deeper. For only a moment, Othmar saw himself, but in someone else's shoes - a fellow griffon, looking not for power, for strength, for influence... but for a better Angriver. \n\nIt appeared, judging by the sudden stop in their anger, that Bluhm saw the same. The two only stared at each other for a good few moments, until finally the Republican coughed, recollected himself, and sighed. "So. About that tea-offer.""
angriver.28.a:0 "A toast to a new friendship!"

angriver.29.t:0 "Political Prisoners Freed"
angriver.29.d:0 ""Wait, so we can just... go home, now?" \n\nAfter the meeting with Mr. Bluhm of the Republicans, Othmar has come to a conclusion in regards to the prisonful of political prisoners left in the wake of the Republican collapse. Rather than keeping them locked up for their political beliefs, he was able to negotiate a peaceful conclusion to the entire Monarchist-Republican conflict. \n\nThe conflict draws closer to an end. As the bars lift and thousands of arrested griffons are freed, Othmar and his new friend Bluhm work day and night to better outline Angriver's future. Cooperation is the only way to end the bloodshed, and the two hardened, warrior griffons know that very well. \n\nNow, rather than fighting against them, all of these well-trained Republicans can be put to better use."
angriver.29.a:0 "Off you go now"

angriver.30.t:0 "The Angriver Constitution"
angriver.30.d:0 ""This is our third draft, Othmar. I think it's good enough--" Bluhm's words fall on deaf ears. Othmar was already tearing out pages and scribbling new footnotes and asterisks to their latest attempt at a constitution. "You know, perhaps you should've stayed in the army. Perhaps politics aren't for you." \n\nOthmar, to that, only looks over his shoulder, shooting him an iron glare that could carve through steel. "Says, of course, the griffon that waltzed into my house and began cursing me out in my doorway. Very diplomatic of you." \n\n"Hey, it's one thing to be a diplomat, it's another thing to be a politician." Bluhm takes a sip of the now-cold tea. "You're more of a diplomat." \n\n"How so?" Othmar curses under his breath as he tears out the page again, starting anew. \n\n"Too many words. A diplomat speaks a lot and doesn't say anything - a politician speaks a little and does a lot." Bluhm says, walking over to the Marshal's desk and looking at his work. "Like this Constitution. Is it really that necessary to give article 13... what is it, one, two, three, four, five - five different footnotes?" \n\n"Why wouldn't it be? This is the code of law for all Angriver - it's got to be perfect, precise, p--" \n\n"Concise, too. Nobody is going to read a Constitution the size of the Holy Book of Boreas. I think it's enough, Othmar. Just..." he picks up a pen from the desk and, suddenly, hashes out a good half of the page. "There we go. Didn't need that. Don't need this, either." he hashes out another one. "Or this." \n\n"Hey!" Othmar leans one claw towards him, but Bluhm quickly pushes him away. \n\n"I think I discovered it. You're not a diplomat, Othmar, you're a writer. Writers always hate it when editors cut down their work." Bluhm chuckles. "I used to be an editor too, for a newspaper, you know? Before I became a general for the Republicans. Do you know how many writers like you I've met, that don't want to cut down their work?

They're simple ponies and griffons - but Angriver doesn't need more than that. Any new pair of hooves or paws will be appreciated, and we're in no position to be picky. \n\nDown the river-road, a carriage of monster hunters splits off from the rest of the immigration convoy, headed towards the forest. Inside, rifle-wielding griffons all toast with bottles of lager, weapons at the ready for their newest challenge. \n\nFurther down the road, another carriage stops in a barren, muddy field, and a small family walks out, looking over their new soon-to-be-farm. As the wife brings the children towards the run-down house at the centre of the field to start cleaning, the father begins to clean up the rocks and mud. \n\nA truckload of workers heads towards Angriver proper, bound for the arms factories. \n\nOur little Barony - our little corner of life, regardless of how harsh and terrible it is, grows little by little. \n\nOthmar smiles.

When before landscape paintings and portraits of aristocrats were popular, now abstract art is being drawn, representing nothing at all yet everything at once.

The loot was melted down into gold ingots which were then equally distributed to the communes. The gold could be used to acquire machines from abroad to boost our industrialisation, and it seems the communes are already planning to do so.\n\nAny religious laws and rules once fervently preached by deluded fanatics were now ignored and Gods were worshipped freely in various ways.

We have uncovered a treasure trove of evidence which lays out her extraordinarily dark plan for Angriver.\n\nSaskia Meckler has assumed leadership of the AVP, and the party has taken a popularity hit as griffons everywhere question their sincerity.

"Many of you are old friends of mine, and I know you have been waiting patiently for an opportunity to set Angriver on the right track. That opportunity is here at last." She gave a humble bow as polite applause filled the hall.\n\n"I often hear griffons complain that they wish to be free, and I am forced to wonder... what do they mean, free? Free to what?

She sneered, Throughout the crowd, members of the AVP glanced around in confusion.\n\n"There is a sickness in the air. Can you sense it? Angriver has been overrun by traitors and cowards. Their bumbling will fatally weaken our country, unless we take control."

Her voice became louder and more emphatic as she clenched her claw into a fist.\n\n"Angriver is sick. Unless it is cleansed of its enemies, it will wither and die. The traitors and cowards, they all must all be purged by our Claw. From this, Angriver will be reborn: stronger than it has ever been!

Covered by dense foliage, little light reached the griffon as she raced through the forest, occasionally glancing behind her. It was just as well: as a known former member of the Anarchist Union, she couldn't afford to get caught.\n\nHer destination was a hideout deep in the heart of the forest. The outpost had remained secret for years, acting as a haven for those trying to escape the Baron's rule. There she would be safe from the Black Claw. She would just have to lay low for a while, and all the bloodshed and paranoia would have to blow over eventually.\n\nAt last she reached the approach to the hideout, but she was only met by a foreboding silence. No lookouts were at their posts and the air was strangely still. She picked up a disgusting stench and followed it to its source. Shrouded in darkness, a dismembered corpse hung above the entrance, strung up as a grisly warning. It was inconceivable. How could they know?\n\nShe heard a small rustling in the underbrush. In an instant, two Black Claw agents were upon her. Emerging from the shadows in a mad frenzy, their blades slashed her repeatedly and with extraordinary swiftness, continuing even after the lacerations they inflicted were surely fatal. What fell to the ground was a drained and shredded husk: another warning to anygriff who attempted to hide from the Claw."

With the final remnants of the Republican traitors removed, Baron Leer's authority is now unquestioned within the Barony of Angriver. \n\nThe griffons of Angriver have accepted that the Baron is the only one fit to rule them, and have accepted his absolute authority over all sections of their lives. Angriver lives and dies with the Baron, and any griffon who disputes that fact will quickly find themselves on the gallows. \n\nOne notable absence from the Baron's usual retinue is Großmarschall Othmar Stoiber, who has recently disappeared after a supposed abduction by Republican terrorists. The Baron has declared that his loyal soldiers are searching the entire Barony for his location and that the vile Republicans will pay for this act of terrorism. Some griffons might consider the Großmarschalls abduction a very convenient one for the Baron, as Othmar had many disagreements with the Baron, but those unwise enough to voice such concerns quickly find themselves imprisoned.  \n\nWhile the Baron has been largely successful in cementing his absolute authority amongst the commoners of Angriver, the same can not be said of the nobility. Despite his best attempts at reassuring them, they still fear another uprising by the Republicans and have doubts in the Barons ability to protect them. "

Three candidates proved to be popular choices, their arguments solid and reasonable: Feathisian Gerben Kogchel of HAP, hero of the revolution Willie Scherler of HAU and Romauan Roland Ehrhardt of HSP. All three had quite different values and the arguments between them got heated at times, but ultimately all three valued democracy above all and allowed the people to make the final decision."

To avoid a bureucratic nightmare the Imperial dialect would remain in use, but every griffon now had the right to receive services in their own dialect. In addition funding was given to those who wished to publish texts in their own tongue.\n\nSoon enough the many libraries of Herzland were filled with new books, local newspapers switched their languages and the sounds of more cosmopolitan cities like Griffenheim became more diverse. While walking on the street one could hear all kinds of languages ranging from Feathisian to Southern Greifenmarsian to Angriverian to the strange language of the diamond dogs of Bronzehill."

When he was about to force himself back to the reports on the world situation and the proposal of a Herzland-led International, he was stopped by knock on the door.\n\n"Come in, mister Rotfeder," Kogchel said, suspecting it was his secretary. The brownfeathered young bird entered, a bunch of papers in claw, but his eyes glittering with joy. "More work, Reinhardt?" The chairgriffon sighed, but got curious when his secretary shook his head and put the papers on Kogchel's desk.\n"Something to keep you going, sir."\n "Don't call me sir, mister Rotfeder."\n "Enjoy it, Gerben..." The secretary quickly retreated from the office, leaving Kogchel alone with yet more papers.\n\nOut of curiosity, Kogchel picked up the top paper and reading out loud. It was a letter. "Dear Chairgriffon, I do not know if this letter will reach you, you must be so busy. However, my family and I want to thank you for your incredible work in improving the country. When the anarchists took over the Heartlands, we thought our country would be thrown into chaos, but with you at the helm, our lives have improved..."\n\nThe letter from Thomas from Greenback was but the first of a series of thankful writings from all over Herzland. At the end of reading, the griffon had a bright smile plastered across his face. This was what he did it all for. Who would have believed that this incredible opportunity came from the anarchists hiding in the most obscure corner of the Heartlands?

Indeed, militias did loot temples, but only so they could share their excessive wealth among the people. And soon after Scherler was elected, religious freedom was proclaimed, much to the relief of all. In fact Scherler even eagerly promoted the worship of the three main gods of the griffon Pantheon, especially Boreas, the God of prosperity. Now religious practices are more alive than ever."

Protests and even riots were held and most concentrated their anger at Ehrhardt, even though he wouldn't have been successful without the support of his party. The tensions caused by this were bad enough for election laws to be reformed and the Congress decentralized even further so more populous regions of Herzland in the northwest would not dominate the lesser populated ones in the southwest, but for now the law would remain in effect despite continued opposition to it."

He and his party, HSP, have met with prominent revolutionaries and leftist intellectuals from all around the world who all gathered in Griffenheim, and together laid the foundations for the International.

Many are fearful of what our future may hold, but I ask that you do not lose sight of the magnitude of what we have accomplished. The corrupt, decaying claw of the Empire has been shattered and we now stand at the precipice of a new age." Her tone began calm, becoming more forceful as she continued.

According to her, promoting equality requires citizens to have a high degree of trust in the government and a willingness to work together to reach compromises and address challenges through democratic processes. Through a social contract which emphasises fairness, citizens have no doubt that public institutions have their best interests in mind.\n\nAn international network of social scientists and political theorists have dedicated themselves to studying Herzland, with the aim of taking its lessons and applying them to their own countries; a situation that would have been unthinkable a few short decades ago.

They were gathered for an amendments convention—the first in the Republic's history—to decide whether to approve an amendment which would alter the distribution of power for Herzland and push the Republic towards a doctrine of shared sovereignty. The proposed "Dual Federal" system would divide power between the Herzland federal government and regional state governments. The clearly defined terms of this division would allow states to exercise their powers without interference from the federal government.\n\nThe representatives were generally supportive of the idea, eager to gain for their states a degree of control that was lost in the unification of Herzland. A vocal minority were skeptical, fearful that dividing power would have the effect of weakening the Republic's ability to operate effectively. President Schmitz called for all their attention, rising to address the convention.\n\n"My friends, we are gathered here today to consider an amendment to our Constitution, an amendment which I fervently believe is vital to preserving freedom in Herzland," Schmitz began. "It is a simple fact that an all-powerful national government is a threat to the liberties of the people; we must be aware of the danger posed by the tyranny of the masses. If centralised power were to fall into the claws of a popular demagogue, the rights of minorities will surely be threatened." The prospect of unchecked democracy unsettled many representatives, swaying them towards Schmitz's position.\n\n"The threat posed by such a figure would be lessened in a federal system. In addition, giving states the autonomy to address their own issues their own ways will lead to better solutions for all of Herzland," Schmitz continued. "To give our citizens the power to choose their own paths forward, I humbly ask that you ratify this amendment." The gathered representatives applauded forcefully."

angriver.63.d:0 "After the fall of the Griffonian Empire, their former subjects came together in an ambitious union called the Herzland Republic. It was an endeavour born out of bold idealism, made possible only through the single-minded determination of Otto Weschler, whose vision of a free Herzland inspired countless others to take up his cause. At the time, savvy observers predicted that differences between the former Imperial vassals would prove irreconcilable and lead to the union's disintegration within half a decade. But the Herzland Republic has survived and become stronger than ever, due in large part to Weschler's successor, Fiona Schmitz.\n\nSkilled at articulating the lofty aspirations of liberty and democracy, she competently shepherded Herzland through a dangerous period of uncertainty after unification with her unwavering leadership. Schmitz recognized the pitfalls posed by a unitary state governing historically diverse Herzland and smartly pushed the Republic towards a federal system, which had a stabilizing effect and proved popular. Investments in increasing industrial efficiency have paid off, and Herzland's economy is among the most advanced in the world. This combination of freedom and prosperity has made the population immensely patriotic, and Herzlanders now proudly boast that theirs is the Land of the Free.\n\nThe future is uncertain, but what is certain is that the people of Herzland will face it bravely, willing to do whatever is necessary to defend their sacred ideals."

Meeting at her mansion in Griffenheim, the Black Claw leadership had assembled to decide whether the time was finally right for Herzland to make its move. They bickered amongst themselves until she raised a claw and called for silence.\n\n"Let us not lose sight of all the progress we have made," began Eichberg. "A land once overrun by traitorous cowards and illiterate riffraff has been transformed into a pious and efficient Ordensstaat by the Claw. Our rule has been solidified, and our new order has mended the soul of Herzland." She smiled wide as her noble audience nodded along approvingly.\n\n"Therefore, it is time to end our isolation. Griffonia will be utterly unprepared, for they can not comprehend the power of the Herzland we have created. When this power is harnessed and brought to bear against any pathetic heretic nation, they will be crushed absolutely." Eichberg chuckled darkly and clenched her claw. Nogriff raised a voice to disagree."

angriver.65.d:0 "Othmar sat at his desk in a repurposed hotel in Griffenheim. Now that he controlled the majority of the Imperial Heartland, he had to deal with the same issues that the Imperial dynasty always had to battle against. How he pitied his old friend Grover V. He could have never imagined how hellish Griffenheim politics could be without now being in the middle of them.\n\nA knock came at his door. A messenger called to him, "Sir Othmar, they are ready to meet you now." Othmar chuckled, of course they were ready to meet him, even though they had come to his office, it was always him meeting them. Taking one more breath, he steeled himself for what was to come. As he was about to meet probably the most significant single barrier between him and peace for the Heartlands, as well as the largest pillar holding up life within the Imperial lands.\n\nThe Archons.\n\nEros is a powerbroker, and one of the most influential griffs alive on this day. Erion is about as good for the Empire as drinking water from a Katerin swamp is suitable for a griffon's health. And Proteus... well he was in a league of his own. But Othmar had to sit them all down and solve their issues at once. Any agreement made with only one would be seen as "Perverting Temple Authority". So here they were, four griffons in a room, one an invader, trying to convince the others to work with him.\n\nThey sat and talked until the moon had risen and gone back under the horizon, but they finally all came to an agreement. Though it was one that made Othmar bury his beak into his claw, things would remain very much the same, just replacing the old order with the new one. The Archonate's powers would be limited, but they could continue much as they had before. The only real change was a backdoor promise from Eros that Erion may not be an issue for much longer. For this, at least, Othmar could be thankful."

angriver.66.t:0 "A Royal Adoption"
angriver.66.d:0 "Othmar stood outside the Imperial palace in Griffenheim. Since the city had been captured, a small contingent of knights and Imperial Guards had held the centre of the palace complex that held the seat of the empire. Othmar had ordered a halt to assaults a weeks earlier, and a siege had begun. Every day he had sent requests to negotiate the surrender, but they had always been refused, until today.\n\nOthmar began to cross the bridge and met the captain of the guard, an old dog named Benito who Othmar had met before. By now, Benito looked like a shadow of his former self, as if withered from war and hunger. He handed his weapons over to Othmar and accepted the food he was offered, walking away to self imposed shame. He walked through the splendid halls at a determined pace, knowing where he needed to end up. And as he entered the Imperial Throne Room, he laid his eyes on the griffon he needed to speak to; the child Emperor himself. Grover VI. The garrison had clearly starved themselves to keep this boy healthy, but even he was showing signs of weakness on his face. They glared at each other for a minute or two, until Othmar decided he needed to break the silence.\n\n"Child, I know how you must look at me. A griff no different than any other power-hungry individual who has circled you for years, trying to gain more power and influence for themselves. But I can show you that I am more than that." the young emperor merely stared, another moment of silence passed before a reply came, "You have made an attempt to dethrone me, you have robbed me of my regent and my advisors, and you send armies into my capital. How can I ever learn to trust someone who does that?". The resolve of the child surprised Othmar, but he did have a reply, he grabbed a chair and sat it down in the middle of the hall and began to speak, "Grover. I am not here to dwell on the past nor am I looking for unearned forgiveness. Instead, I urge you to look towards the future, like your father before he was robbed from us all." This stirred the young boy, who leaned in to hear what this strange invader from the south had to say. "I knew your father when we were both young, before I was brought back to my homeland. He spoke of how he wished to make the empire anew, to bring its citizens joy, but the damn revolution destroyed that chance. And the vultures of his council wished to halt his ambitions for their own gain. They cared not for the empire at all! You have vultures as well my child. Anyone who has good intentions always does". "And you do not?" the young emperor quipped. Othmar chuckled, lightening the mood in the room, "I may have had them a long time ago, I simply had the common sense to put a stop to their dirty deals before they could hold me captive." growing somber, Othmar continued his plea, "I once let this madhouse of an empire crush my friend and I won't let it happen to his son. I need to account for what I failed to do in the past with actions I shall take now. Please, walk with me and we can make this right."\n\nGrover stood and followed the Baron. It was all made official, to suit the formalities of court, Othmar became godfather to the last emperor of the Griffonian Empire. And the regent to the first King of the Griffons."

angriver.67.t:0 "New Friends"
angriver.67.d:0 "Othmar sat, claws massaging his temples as he tried to comprehend how he had gotten himself into this. He had called the nobles of the former Imperial territories to a grand banquet in Griffenheim to draft a new agreement on their privileges in his new fairer system. And while he still intended to do that, he never could have conceived the effects of what he had done.\n\nHe now sat at the head of an enormous table, lined with the nobles of the realm. And they were having a shouting match over dessert. It all started when two families who had argued over the rights to some factory near Kingston began bickering at the feast. Being who they were, the nobles began to form factions even over something so little as this.\n\nBut, even as it started to seem as if Othmar's patience had hit a breaking point, he conjured up a plan. Othmar had a knack for turning messes into opportunities, and he aimed to do the same here. He knew many of these nobles in the room were firmly against his plans for the democratization of the Herzland, and he knew exactly how to make them quiet down at least a bit.\n\nOthmar stood and tapped his glass with a fork to ask for quiet, calmly he stood and declared to the crowd, "Ladies and Gentlegriffs, it seems you all have lost sight of why we are here, you wish to bicker over the possession of one factory when cooperation could get you each many more. And if you could only spare me a bit more of your time, we can get all of that ordered and discuss how this new democracy thing will function."\n\nIt worked like a charm. The nobles were intrigued by the promise of wealth, and since Othmar hadn't technically bribed them, they had to at least cooperate for a while before they could turn sour on him again. And who knows? Some of the nobles may be genuine in their interest in democracy. Othmar could only hope. Only hope for a better world."

angriver.68.d:0 "Othmar had been waiting for this moment. It had been as long a time coming as he could remember, ever since he saw the first nobles torture commoners in his youth, when he saw his old friend Grover's regency council take matters into their own claws and just... ruin it all. Ever since the first time he thought, "Wouldn't the people pick the best leaders for those people?". He was not a republican by any means, far from it. He planned to elevate the former child-emperor to a new position of power as King of his new Herzland and create a lasting peace. But for this peace to occur, his land needed competent leaders that would go on after his death and the eventual death of Grover himself. And for that, they required elections.\n\nThis was his magnum opus, his grant moment of final victory, and he was sending the message out live to the whole nation.\n\nOthmar stepped onto the balcony of the royal palace, Grover by his side, now just old enough to maybe understand what was all going on. He stepped up to the microphone positioned in front of him and began to speak...\n\n "Citizens of Herzland, I speak to you today from the city of Griffenheim, once the capital of a mighty but flawed nation. And due to that flaw, it fell under the sway of vultures who wished to tear at its carcass for their own gain, and pervert the rights of the people who lived under its dominion. But today, you all live under a different nation, the Herzland. A land in which all may live at peace under their King. But we still possess the same issue that the old Empire had, one I had vowed to resolve long ago, and that must now come to fruition. I decree, as regent of this land, with my King by my side, that in six months time, all in the land shall conduct a free and fair election, to choose representatives who shall serve them with diligence. Vote well citizens, your King is counting on you."\n\nWith that Othmar exited the balcony with Grover. When they entered the hallway, the young King and the elder regent shared a smile with one another. They shared something in that moment.\n\n\nThey could both finally be at peace with their pasts."

But today was a more special day for this great city, today it would receive its first King in open arms. King Grover, as he would be crowned, was the same Grover who the old Imperial state had tried to elevate as the sixth of his line upon the former throne of the Empire. But the nation Grover would soon lead would be a new one. The Kingdom of Herzland. And as the crowds waited with bated breath for the speech to begin, the Regent Othmar Stoiber stepped onto the podium.\n\n"My fellow griffons. Today is a momentous occasion for the entirety of the Herzland, and all of Griffonia. I can say with certainty it is the proudest day of my life by far. For today, Griffonia meets a new nation. Yes, we have been on the map for a long time, but I have always ruled in the stead of the true monarch of these lands. One who the people have heard from, but not indeed known. He will be coronated today as the King of this land, an affair which I can say I have had no part in planning. What you hear today are the words of your King and of no other. And so I am just as excited as you are. Maybe with this, I can finally retire!", the suddenly casual turn of the speech produced many laughs from the crowd. Not many of them had seen this griff anything but severe and steel-faced their entire lives. "And so now, citizens of Herzland, I present to you your leader. As I now formally abdicate the title of regent. And shall step aside to allow the King to take his place."\n\nOthmar took his leave from the microphone stand and walked back into the building behind the podium. And from the same door, emerged Grover himself. The people were used to seeing him by now, but not as he appeared to them today. On this day, he emerged not in lavish royal regalia, but in a simple dress suit with only slightly fancy embroidery. He was here today not to rule over them, but to rule for them. Applause ran rampant in the crowd, only stopping with the young King raised a claw after he had reached the microphone. "My people, I can not convey to you the joy I feel to be standing with you here today. I was born into a decaying empire, which had used violence and war in attempts to subjugate the continent only to fail over and over because it did not exist in service of the people. My first and only goal as your King is to ensure that this never happens again. I may have once been Grover the sixth of the Imperial dynasty, but not longer. I moments ago, signed paperwork officially removing my personal claims to the throne of the old empire, and any land that it may have once claimed as well. I am now your king and your king alone. I am nothing but Grover the first of the Herzland. I hope with all of my heart, I shall be able to serve you to the best of my ability. To make life better for you all and to truly achieve a nation which will nurture its citizens like a mother does her chick. I know my very image carries bitter memories for some. But I pray that you all may look beyond, and accept me as who I am."\n\nWith these words, the whole of the city was silent. Tears welled up in many griffon's eyes as they watched the young boy they had watched grow up become King. And none felt this more then Othmar, who had already begun to weep of joy halfway through the great speech. As applause erupted once more, no one in the castle was paying enough attention to Othmar to see him pull out an old locket with an image inside. When Othmar peered in, he saw the face of a younger Grover V. Nothing like the Emperor who had ruled in the final years leading up to his death. Othmar cradled the locket in one claw and placed the other over his heart, "You may rest now my friend."\n\n"You may rest.""

With the Imperial Heartlands consolidated, some within the party were advocating annexation into Kemerskai's Republic in the north. Reinhard Olbeaking was one such griffon, a moderate NRP delegate. Hans Hertzog, an influential figure in the War Ministry, disagreed. Both griffons sat before Bluhm to make their case.\n\n"We share the same goal: Liberty, Democracy, and Prosperity. These principles guide us both," Olbeaking began.  "Beyond that, Kemerskai is a living legend. He's even more popular than you!" Olbeaking gestured at Bluhm, who scowled. "As the forerunner of our Republic, it's only right that we unite with him in the lead."\n\n"Nonsense!" Hertzog erupted. "This Republic was won with our blood. It was our struggle. And you're saying we should give it away to a failure who has accomplished nothing?" Hertzog slammed his fist down on the table. "While Kemerskai sat idle, Bluhm was leading us to victory! Seems to me like he should be the one coming to us."\n\nBluhm held up a claw, signalling for the two griffons to stop. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath.

Behind him stood a collection of the most committed NRP delegates as well as Hans Hertzog, chief of the newly-formed Ministerium für Öffentliche Sicherheit.\n\n"We have accomplished much in our fight for freedom," began Bluhm. "The Heartlands are united and we now stand victorious." Bluhm held out his claws as the crowd cheered. "There is much to celebrate, but also much left to be done. Our mission is to bring the light of freedom to all griffons, but many elsewhere still live in darkness." He frowned.\n\n"We have it in our power to liberate every griffon on this continent, to reshape Griffonia into a shining beacon for the world." Bluhm clenched his claw into a fist.

Papers containing the leaked material were already in circulation by the time the MfÖS was alerted. In preparation, journalists and other employees barricaded themselves inside the building, forcing the agents to call in a locksmith to gain entry.\n\nAs the siege dragged on, angry griffons who had heard news of the Act gathered outside the offices to heckle the agents. Bricks and rocks filled the air as they were pelted by the sweltering agitators. But soon enough, the building was breached, the presses disabled, and the paper's employees all arrested.\n\nIt was evening by the time Hertzog delivered his report on the incident to the President.

The crowd demanded that the imprisoned journalists be released and that new elections be called. The police called for the crowd to disperse immediately, but they were not heeded. There would be no negotiations.\n\nIn response, the police forces began forced dispersal, but after much pushing and shoving, the crowd refused to budge.

Saskia Meckler was in Griffenheim when the unrest began, and was already trusted by the rebels, having been a consistent voice advocating reform for years. When the rebel groups met to plan their next move, Meckler rose to give a fiery exhortation.\n\n"Bluhm's illegal acts have rendered his authority illegitimate.

The rebels seemed to draw from every type of griffon: poor students and workers took up arms alongside wealthy entrepreneurs, all united in their hatred for Bluhm.\n\nFrom their base in central Griffenheim, they quickly overwhelmed the scattered police forces. Soon entire armories were being sacked, and the rebels controlled a significant portion of the city.

The soldiers scrambled to take cover behind whatever they could as rebels barricaded the streets out of the plaza. They were trapped; fighting would be their only way out.\n\nBluhm knew he had to rally his troops. He flew up above them and unsheathed his sabre, pointing it at the barricade that blocked their advance. "Forward, damn it!" he shouted. "Forward!" His blade gleamed in the sun for only a brief moment before he fell out of the sky. Blood spilled onto the cobblestones where he landed. Gerhard Bluhm had been shot.\n\nAt the Presidential Mansion, Hertzog received the grim news along with even worse news: mass defections were spreading through all the columns sent into the city. Without Bluhm, and perhaps even with him, the soldiers of the Republican Army were more inclined to fight with the citizens of Griffenheim than against them.

She wrinkled her beak, partly out of disgust for his actions, and partly from his stench.\n\n"Saskia, I'm sorry, you were right! You have to believe me when I say that I never wanted any of this to happen!" pled Olbeaking.

Illegal surveillance, arbitrary searches and seizures, and indefinite detentions without trial were among their laundry list of accusations.\n\nHertzog's defence claimed that he had only ever followed orders given by President Bluhm, his superior, and thus could not be held legally responsible.

angriver.85.t:0 "The Coronation"
angriver.85.d:0 "On a sunny day in Griffenheim, griffons all across the city turned out to witness the crowning of a new Emperor. The mood was slightly anxious, for this was an impossibly momentous occurrence. It would officially mark the end of a dynasty that had led the Empire to glory and innumerable triumphs stretching back centuries, and the start of something many were still unsure of.\n\nLeer headed a procession through the streets, followed by disciplined columns of Imperial troops. Despite the adulutation of the cheering crowds he paid them no heed, staying squarely focused on his route. Following a winding path, he eventually arrived at the Imperial Palace, where the coronation ceremony was to take place.\n\nLeer climbed the steps of the Palace flanked by his loyal soldiers. At the top, his destiny awaited him. In a break from tradition, Leer elected to crown himself rather than being crowned by an Archon. Looking down over the crowds, he placed the Imperial Crown upon his head. In an instant, the age-old succession was shattered and a new dynasty was born."
angriver.85.a:0 "All hail Emperor Leer!"

angriver.86.t:0 "Out With the Old"
angriver.86.d:0 "Ungrateful as ever, members of the aristocracy are barely able to hide their contempt for Emperor Leer. At state banquets they smile and shake his claw, pretending to accept him, but their words are nothing more than insincere flattery. In reality they are simply biding their time, plotting and scheming his downfall in the shadows. We know the truth, and we know what must be done.\n\nIn order to secure our position the corrupt, decadent, and disloyal nobility shall be purged. Wherever they hide and whatever excuses they try to conjure up will not save them from the sword of justice. There are many griffons who will be more than eager to take their place, and who will be eternally grateful to the Emperor for his magnanimity."
angriver.86.a:0 "I never liked them anyway."

angriver.87.t:0 "The Imperial Cult"
angriver.87.d:0 "An interesting idea has begun to take hold among the population of Griffenheim. Seeking an explanation for the defeats and humiliations inflicted upon the Empire during the reign of the late Grover dynasty, many have come to the conclusion that the bloodline's moral failures caused it to lose the favour of the Gods. To these griffons, the appeal of the fierce and militarily victorious Emperor Leer is strong, and they point to him as having earned the title of rightful inheritor of the Gods' favour.\n\nHecaterus, a local priest in Griffenheim, not only agrees with this view but also takes it a step further. He forcefully espouses the position that Leer is the Empire's representative to the Gods, and that he is the singular incarnation of the Empire's glory. He also praises the moral excellence of Leer, citing the harsh steps he has taken against the corrupt old nobility, whose greed and impiety were notorious among those in the city.\n\nGriffons from all walks of life have proven to be surprisingly receptive to this message. We should promote Hecaterus to a position of greater authority, so that his words may reach as many griffons as possible. All shall know that it is Leer's divine destiny to rule, and that his will is the will of the Gods!"
angriver.87.a:0 "Glory to the Empire!"

angriver.88.t:0 "The Scourging of Cloudbury"
angriver.88.d:0 "During the Republican Revolution of 978, Leer—then Baron of Angriver—saw his domain nearly brought to ruin by Republicans and their unruly peasant allies. In time, he expelled this menace from Angriver, but Cloudbury had become a haven for such traitors: a "Bandit State" as Leer dubbed them. This betrayal had not been forgotten by the time the territory was once again under Imperial control.\n\nWhen Emperor Leer's forces marched into Cloudbury, it signalled the beginning of a purge that would see the disease of Republicanism cleaned from the land once and for all. Nogriff was safe and all across the former Republic, Imperial troops spilled the blood of those accused of collaborating with the Republcian regime. Brutal mass killings and the destruction of entire villages were common occurrences: the Cloudburian people's punishment for harbouring the Empire's enemies."
angriver.88.a:0 "Thus unto traitors!"

angriver.89.t:0 "The Crown of Grover II"
angriver.89.d:0 "When Emperor Leer entered Griffonstone he was immediately captivated by the city's charm. The significance of griffonkind's ancestral home was not lost on him, and he took his time admiring the unique architecture of Griffonstone and taking in all the history he could. His love of the city caused him to order the capital be moved there, but that was not why he had come.\n\nHe had come to take rightful possession of an ancient artifact: Grover II's crown. Leer admired Grover II and venerated him as the greatest warrior-emperor that had ever been, and believed himself to be the inheritor of the old emperor's legacy. Just as Grover II had crushed the rebellious Aquileans and invading Nimbusians to preserve the Empire, Leer would conquer the Empire's enemies again, this time to restore what had been lost.\n\nWhen Leer first saw the crown during the ceremony he could not deny it was the most majestic item he had ever laid eyes on. He knelt humbly, in contrast to his usual demeanour, and bowed his head for the coronation. The assembled griffons stood silently in awe of him, for they all could sense the power of the God Emperor of Griffonkind."
angriver.89.a:0 "Like you, great one, I shall make the world tremble!"

angriver.90.t:0 "Remota Privilegia"
angriver.90.d:0 "Our reclamation of the rightful Imperial territory of Aquileia presents us with a golden opportunity to restructure society; we shall use this opportunity to permanently break the power of the nobles. It was their greed and incompetence that enabled the Empire's decline to begin with, and we'll be damned if we're going to let that happen again!\n\nThe Aquileian aristocracy is especially degenerate, with a long history of abusing their privileges and provoking unrest, and so they will see their privileges curtailed. All noble tax exemptions are henceforth voided, and government offices will no longer be up for sale. These measures are sure to make us popular with the common griffons. Let it be known that from now on, commoners and nobles are all equal in the eyes of the law!"
angriver.90.a:0 "Their avarice will endanger the Empire no longer."

angriver.91.t:0 "The Destruction of Karthin"
angriver.91.d:0 "Emperor Leer always held special contempt in his heart for the "False Kingdom" south of the Empire, and so it was inevitable that the revenge his forces planned to inflict upon Wingbardy's capital after its fall would be harsh. An eerie gloom descended across Karthin once the fighting was over and the city was pacified, with the population waiting with dread to discover their fate. Once Imperial troops had finished extracting all of Karthin's moveable wealth, fires broke out all across the city.\n\nAided by an unusually dry season, the blaze swiftly spread out from multiple sources and consumed everything in its path. It destroyed without prejudice, with poor slums burning the same as storied Karthinian museums and theatres. Great masses fled from the conflagration in a frenzied panic, with very few surviving. In the aftermath, it is estimated that up to nine tenths of the city's surface area was rendered uninhabitable. The ancient centre of glory and power throughout southern Griffonia had been razed to the ground."
angriver.91.a:0 "The only thing Wingbardy deserves."

ANG_archon_erion_desc:0 "Youngest of the three Archons, born in 959, Erion XII has risen rapidly through the ranks of the Eyrite Temple to the very top. However, this was not achieved by exceptional piety alone, nor by hard and honest work. Erion is ever hungry for more power and is not afraid to use more questionable and violent means to gain it. Now that he has achieved supremacy in the Archonate of Eyr itself, he seeks to grow his temporal power as well.\n\nAll this has made Erion rather unpopular among the nobility and the clergy, who see him as a threat and a lunatic. The hatred is mutual, as Erion often rants about the corruption of the nobles of Griffonia and the senators of Romau, and the incompetence and lack of zealotry of the priesthood. Many commoners are swayed by his fiery and passionate speeches, especially among the lower classes. Erion's control of education contributes to this as young students are indoctrinated and turned into faithful servants of Eyr.\n\nWhile Erion is power-hungry, none can deny he is a devout Eyrite as well. His parents, poor industrial workers in Romau, were very religious and conservative, and sent all their children to a temple school. There, the eyes of their youngest child, Lorenz Whitefeather, were opened and he became a faithful servant of Eyr, the goddess of fertility and family. After becoming an Archon, Lorenz chose the archonal name of Erion. Even to this day, Erion sends money to his old parents, and preaches the importance of traditional values.\n\nErion has a tenuous relationship with his fellow Archons of the Borean and Arcturian temples. As Eros is one of the most influential griffons in Heartlands, Erion always seeks to impress him and earn his favour, so Eros would entrust him with more power. Eros sees through his act, however, but sees him as a useful if dangerous pawn. Proteus on the other claw openly distrusts and dislikes Erion, and Erion despises him in return for his lack of piety and neglect of clerical duty. The two only work together because they must."

the_mailman_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 2nd of June, 927 in Griffing\n\n§YBiography§!: Otto Weschler was born the son of Conrad Weschler, a prosperous Griffing merchant. Although well-off, Otto's family was ostracised from polite society as a result of widespread suspicion that Conrad was involved in black market trade, an accusation that Conrad and his family always denied. Regardless, young Otto declined to follow his father's path and instead pursued a career in the civil service. After university he began working as a mail carrier for the Griffing post office, beginning what would turn out to be a long and distinguished career.\n\nAs he worked his way up from mail carrier to postmaster of Griffing, Otto was shocked at the corruption and mismanagement he witnessed. Concluding that nepotism was the root cause of the problem, he resolved to put a stop to it. But it was no easy task, and a long period of struggle followed as Otto was continually thwarted by the entrenched and powerful families of Griffing.\n\nEventually, after years of effort, Otto succeed in turning the Griffing post office into an efficient, meritocratic department. His accomplishments did not go unnoticed, with the Baron himself praising the job Otto had done, and elevating him to Postmaster General of Angriver. His past stewardship of the Postal Service is one of Angriver's few unconditional success stories and earned him near-universal popularity: popularity he has leveraged to springboard his way to the forefront of public life as an advocate for liberal principles.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Cofido"

Her formal education began at a young age under the direction of highly regarded tutors from across the Empire. A diligent student, Schmitz displayed an avid curiosity in all fields, and outside her studies often read books from her family's sprawling library.\n\nAfter graduating with highest honours, she began working as a law clerk, eventually becoming a lawyer in her own right. Thanks to family connections, her client list soon included members of the Angriver's elite families. In the course of practicing law, Schmitz was exposed to the rampant corruption endemic in Angriver's legal system, and developed a keen interest in curbing it.\n\nThis interest caused her to come into contact with Otto Weschler, a conscientious leader within the civil service who shared her goal of reforming the machinery of government. Schmitz was inspired by the ideals espoused by Weschler, and quickly became his devoted protege. They both believed that the injustices and excesses of Angriver were the result of institutional failures rather than griffon nature, and that individual liberties combined with political equality were the antidote to arbitrary government.\n\nA staunch believer in the virtue of republicanism, Schmitz's vision for a better society emphasises secularism, a free yet regulated market, and protections for civil liberties.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Cofido"

little_kemerskai_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 31st of October, 946 outside Gerashofen\n\n§YBiography§!: Gerhard Bluhm was born in a small town in rural Angriver, the son of poor farmers. His humble upbringing did nothing to stunt his ambition, which led him to join the Imperial Army in the hope of gaining glory, but his hopes were dashed and he found himself disgruntled with the Empire's rigid and outdated military doctrine. When Kemerskai launched his Republican Revolution in 978 Bluhm was an enthusiastic supporter, believing the Empire was in need of drastic reform to thrive in a changing world.\n\nAfter the Revolution failed, Bluhm declined to follow his fellow Republicans in the Long March North. He instead returned to Angriver to form a resistance, beginning what would become a decades-long fight to free his homeland. With limited resources and a rag-tag force, Bluhm was a constant thorn in the side of the Barony. Unwavering resolve and courage are traits that Bluhm's soldiers always attributed to him during this period.\n\nHis short stature in combination with staunch Republican ideals earned him the nickname "Little Kemerskai." Nogriff would dare use it in his presence, though, as he bears an intense grudge against Kemerskai for his bungling of the first Republican Revolution. In Bluhm's view, it was Kemerskai's weakness and leniency that allowed a counter-revolution to take place.\n\nBluhm swears that he will go to any length to protect the Republic and uphold the Three Principles. With the length of his résumé and the impressiveness of his accomplishments, that looks to be a great length indeed.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Riley"

reinhard_olbeaking_desc:0 "Reinhard Olbeaking's unlikely rise to political prominence began in the turbulence following the fall of the Angriverian Barony. An obscure journalist working for a Griffing newspaper, he was inspired by Republican rhetoric and began authoring pro-NRP columns and pamphlets which proved extremely popular. This fame led to him being elected as a delegate representing Griffing in the newly-formed national legislature.\n\nAs the Republic rose, he became the leader of the NRP's moderate faction, occasionally butting heads with Bluhm over the government's role in civil society. The two eventually reconciled and Olbeaking was chosen by Bluhm to act as his Vice President, although the office was largely ceremonial and wielded little actual power. Olbeaking served as a figurehead more than anything else, cementing the marginalised status of the moderate NRP.\n\nRumours swirl that Olbeaking was dissatisfied and complicit in the plot against Bluhm, though few believe he is a griffon capable of such deviousness."

The rebels seemed unstoppable until Marshal Stoiber—a close friend of Leer—was able to rally his forces and begin supporting the Baron.\n\nTheir partnership proved fruitful, and together they began to push back the Republican army. Leer showed the rebels no mercy in battle and displayed a shocking brutality which extended to harsh treatment of captured prisoners. Although Stoiber found this behaviour off-putting he did not have much time to dwell on it; in short order the two put an end to organized resistance in Angriver. The campaign had been a success, but it marked the beginning of a permanent rift between Leer and Stoiber. After the restoration of Grover V, Leer was rewarded for his service and Angriver was given greater autonomy within the Empire.\n\nThe crisis had pushed the Baron to his absolute limit, some say leaving him a broken griffon. Although he always had a controlling personality and a propensity for micromanagement he has grown increasingly obsessive in recent years, allegedly because he envisions a day when chaos and instability will return to Griffonia with a vengeance, and that to survive both he and his country must be prepared.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
emperor_leer_desc:0 "The first thing one notices upon meeting Emperor Leer is the confidence with which he carries himself. He is a leader without a single iota of fear or uncertainty, and merely being in his presence seems to steel the resolve of griffons whose faith may be wavering. This quality served him well when leading his armies into battles, from which he invariably emerged victorious. Not content with being a fierce warrior, Leer also possess superior wisdom: he is a brilliant and unparalleled strategist, formulating his plans with an almost supernatural foresight.\n\n"Our Emperor is accustomed to taking decisive action; as Baron of Angriver, he witnessed the damage being inflicted upon his land by godless revolutionaries and took sole command of the loyalist forces, crushing the hordes of chaos in a lightning campaign. The experience left him a changed griffon, and he vowed never to rest until peace and prosperity for his beloved subjects could be guaranteed. A pious griffon, there is no doubt that his ascension was the will of the Gods."\n—Rudolf Rümker, Court Historian"
willie_scherler_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 29th of April, 957 in Romau\n\n§YBiography§!: Willie Scherler was once a professor of sociology at Cyrusval university in Yale. Passionate about his field and a staunch anarcho-syndicalist, he was popular with his students and became well-known for giving lively and rousing lectures. Ironically for an academic, he preferred actions over ideas and grew restless at his post. He came to resent his peers at the university for being armchair revolutionaries, and burned with a desire to take the future into his own claws.\n\nOne day he resigned from his position and left for Angriver to put his theories into practice. Filling a vacuum in leadership, he quickly became a rallying point for the disorganised socialist groups in Angriver, and in time came to lead all of them. It was under his direction that the Free State Army became reorganised into a trained and formidable guerilla force.\n\nScherler has a forceful yet compassionate personality and is a natural leader, inspiring intense loyalty in his followers. He is a devout believer in the Gods, although he disdains the rigid structure and dogma of established temples, which he views as distorting and misrepresenting the true messages of the Gods for their own gain.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
ANG_kogchel_desc:0 "Gerben Kogchel was born as the son of a bank clerk in De Vleugels, the Feathisian capital. Even though his father died when he was young, Gerben would initially follow his lead, working for a local bank. From studying finances, he quickly learned that the Feathisian state could do better. Many griffons were living in poverty or uncertainty, only a bad illness away from hunger. Distressed by the lack of protection for everygriffon, Kogchel joined the PvdA to fight for worker protection. His genuine empathy and drive to make Feathisia a better place saw him grow popular on the local level, where he became the first PvdA mayor for de Vleugels, which saw the city improving care for the poorest.\n\nHis newfound popularity reached across party lines and it was said that Kogchel had a longstanding correspondence with the Grand Duke of Feathisia. When Kogchel entered parliament after winning a leadership election in the labour party, opposition to his plans stiffened. Both the Liberal Democrats and the ducal party resisted his plans and there was even less of a chance the FNV would cooperate. Still, Kogchel laboured on without resenting his political opponents, trying ever so hard to change Feathisia for the better.\n\nThe social democrat's effort all seemed to crash down in the chaos following the fall of the Empire, as more violent and pessimistic forces overtook Feathisia. However, with Kogchel at the helm, the more moderate griffons never lost hope for a better tomorrow. Kogchel's briefcase full of social reforms became a symbol of hope all on its own, as the politician refused to part with them under any circumstances, to remind himself what he was fighting for. Now after so much death and destruction, it is time to rebuild. Gerben Kogchel hopes to breathe new life into Herzland; to implement working democracy and mend Herzland's unstable society. However, some are worried that the idealistic griffon will leave an already battered region vulnerable in this uncertain age."
ANG_ERHARDT_DESC:0 "When describing Roland Ehrhardt, the first word that comes to mind is radical. De-facto leader of the Romauan labour movement, Ehrhardt has made his mark on Romau in more ways than one. He led hundreds of strikes, narrowly avoided tens of assassinations by the Romau Council, and even burned down a few temples or two in his crusade against the Archonate, the Empire, and those who would harm the workers of Romau.\n\nEhrhardt was born in 961, in a position very similar to most Romauans: while the senate spent lavishly and fought amongst themselves, he grew up in relative poverty. His slum's position close to a sprawling temple of Eyr fueled his religious animosity, and when they continually drove back demanding charity, he began to doubt the Gods' grace entirely. His mother and father both participated in the labour movement, and Roland soon joined them in a craftworker's union at the age of 16. He rose the ranks of the union, rising from worker to organizer, and when the Republican revolution began, he joined his fellow workers in a mass general strike.\n\nAlthough the Romauan revolution, and inevitably, the Republican revolution itself, failed, Ehrhardt continued organizing, eventually outranking his own parents and becoming the appointed representative of his union in 997.\n\nEhrhardt petitioned the council numerous times for rights, and when they refused, he organized strike after strike until his workers got what they wanted. His childhood animosity toward the Eyrians culminated in a violent anti-religious campaign, and Ehrhardt and thousands of other workers participated in burnings of Romau temples in protest of the corrupt Archon, Erion.\n\nNow Ehrhardt is Chairgriffon of the Congress, with all the power necessary to settle his lifelong scores with the powerful, corrupt, and dishonest griffons who have betrayed the people of Herzland."

Despite the harsh conditions he had a fairly well childhood due to the efforts of his loving parents. However this put an incredible strain on his father who worked long and difficult hours. As a result growing up Marc witnessed the health of his father noticeably deteriorate. Seeing the similar situation in the rest of the village, Marc would be motivated to leave his village to study medicine.\n\nDuring his travels throughout Angriver he realised the poor conditions his village suffered were shared by the rest of Angriver. He witnessed poverty and hunger everywhere he went and became appalled by these poor conditions. He realised no matter how hard he tried, there would be thousands of griffons left untreated and many more who could not afford treatment. These experiences caused Marc to leave the study of medicine and enter the political scene. Yet he realised political change was impossible as long as Baron Leer was in power and the only way to solve these problems was a eventual revolution. Since then he has joined the Angriver Military and risen through the ranks and has come into contact with several republican cells.\n\nHe has contracts with the National Republican Party and is highly supportive of their dream of a Pan-Griffonian Republic. When the time arises he would happily aid the efforts of the republicans to overthrow the Barony and fight for their cause.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Axidant"

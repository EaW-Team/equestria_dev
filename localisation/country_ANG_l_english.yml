### Ideas ###
ANG_anarchists:0 "The Free State Army"
ANG_anarchists_desc:0 "During the Republican Revolution of 978 Angriver found itself fighting not only the Republicans but the peasant militias of the Angriver Anarchist Union.\n\n While the Revolution and by extension the Anarchists themselves were quickly defeated a year afterwards, many of their former soldiers, leaders and supporters have fled into the Scheißwald. They continually plague our society decades later, unfortunately."
ANG_cults:0 "The Black Claw"
ANG_cults_desc:0 "Beneath the fabric of Angriverian society lies a sinister and malicious organization hence labeled as "The Black Claw". Despite the best efforts of our leaders over CENTURIES of knowing the existence of these troublesome loons, none have succeeded thus far. To this day their end-goals and motives remain a complete mystery. For most the Black Claw are boogeybirds, mere bedtime stories to scare the young at night."
ANG_underdeveloped_economy:0 "Underdeveloped Economy"
ANG_underdeveloped_economy_desc:0 "Angriver has the "honor" of being perhaps the least developed county in the Imperial Heartlands as for centuries the Scheißwald has successfully discouraged extensive investment due to being a breeding ground for an array of abhorrent creatures and murderous bandits."

### Focuses ###
ANG_army_stuff:0 "Formalize the Angriverian Army"
ANG_army_stuff_desc:0 "Prior to the Republican Revolution of 978, the defense of Angriver was handled by informal militia levied by the barony’s various townships and petty nobles. Since the revolution however, a number of militias have been kept in service in order to defend the borderlands and hunt down the remains of the Free State Army. It’s about time that we organize these units into a proper Angriverian Army."
ANG_mass_combat:0 "Bauer Doctrine"
ANG_mass_combat_desc:0 "With the Angriverian Army finally formalized, it is now time to pick which school of strategic thought would best suit our military. Sieger Bauer has proposed a strategy of defense-in-depth which would see our armies fight a fierce guerilla campaign in the face of invasion. He claims that such a strategy would best suit our infantry-focused and industrial starved nation."
ANG_trenches:0 "Stoiber Doctrine"
ANG_trenches_desc:0 "With the Angriverian Army finally formalized, it is now time to pick which school of strategic thought would best suit our military. Othmar Stoiber has proposed a strategy centred around fortification building and a defensive focused military. His strategy would be based around our terrain, using the heavily forested landscape and multiple rivers to create a comprehensive defense against invasion."
ANG_massive_firepower:0 "Henniger Doctrine"
ANG_massive_firepower_desc:0 "With the Angriverian Army finally formalized, it is now time to pick which school of strategic thought would best suit our military. Arwin Henninger has proposed a strategy centred around the use of artillery and supporting units to augment the effectiveness of our infantry. Henniger has assured the high command that such an army would be highly flexible and be able to rapidly adapt to strategic developments."
ANG_angriver_rangers:0 "Angriverian Rangers"
ANG_angriver_rangers_desc:0 "The Angriverian Rangers have existed for over a century, with their mission being to patrol the Scheißwald forest and protect the citizens of Angriver from the monsters and other horrors that lie within. Recently, it’s been proposed that we should include the rangers within our military structure in order to use their elite skills against hostile invaders."
ANG_our_traditions:0 "Ranger Training"
ANG_our_traditions_desc:0 "The Angriverian Rangers have a reputation for being highly capable huntsmen with an reputation for reliably tracking their pray. With their inclusion into our military structure, it’s been proposed that they share their skills with our traditional army in order to better train our reconnaissance units in the art of tracking and stalking enemy formations."
ANG_modern_infantry:0 "A New Rifle"
ANG_modern_infantry_desc:0 "While the Hinterladerbuecshe rifle has served our armed forces well for the last few decades, its age is beginning to show as it is outclassed by newer designs. As such, it’s about time that we turn to our nation’s leading armament firms in an effort to design a new standard issue rifle."
ANG_filled_arsenals:0 "Griffing Arsenal"
ANG_filled_arsenals_desc:0 "Traditionally, the procurement of equipment for the Angriverian militias was done in partnership with privately owned industrial firms. While effective, it has come into question if these firms can be trusted in these politically trying times. As such, we have established the Griffing Arsenal, a state-run enterprise which will be responsible for producing arms, equipment, and munitions for the Angriverian army."
ANG_support_squads:0 "Enhance Infantry Formations"
ANG_support_squads_desc:0 "Developments across the globe have shown an increase in combat effectiveness when adding supporting companies onto traditional infantry divisions. By replicating the success of this onto our own armed forces we can expect them to perform better in engagements."
ANG_magical_infantry:0 "Experimental Weaponry"
ANG_magical_infantry_desc:0 "The recent discovery of Crystal reserves in Angelclaw have brought to our attention the possibility of developing a crystal-based infantry weapon. While developments in this field are largely experimental, and have proved only marginally successful, it’s theorized that such weaponry could one day be highly effective in combat."
ANG_modern_knights:0 "Legacy of the Verlorene Hoffnungen"
ANG_modern_knights_desc:0 "The Verlorene Hoffnungen are an elite unit of knights within the Angriverian Army. Their roots date back to the Revolution of 978, when the Baron called upon his various petty nobles to come to his aid. The unit formed in response and it was due to their tremendous bravery that the war was won by imperial forces. However, the knights are now in dire need of fresh blood, improved equipment, and updated doctrine."
ANG_special_forces:0 "Angriverian Special Forces"
ANG_special_forces_desc:0 "Across the globe, developments in training and doctrine have created a series of niche rolls for specialized infantry formations. These include units trained for combat in mountains, units designed to be dropped behind enemy lines, and units tasked with assaulting objectives during a naval landing. This level of specialization could be highly beneficial to our cause. "
ANG_artillery_modernization:0 "Modernize our Batteries"
ANG_artillery_modernization_desc:0 "The Republican Revolution proved the ineffectiveness of our artillery in combat, with our big guns performing especially poorly. This can be mostly attributed to the use of antique muzzle-loaded cannons rather than breach-loaded pieces. While this problem has been somewhat mitigated there are still great strides to be made in the development and implementation of artillery technology."
ANG_radio_towers:0 "Equestrian Witchcraft"
ANG_radio_towers_desc:0 "The engineers of Equestria have developed a new piece of technology known as RADAR. While initially used for the tracking of commercial planes, the technology can be adapted to spot enemy aircraft from incredible distances, allowing for them to be intercepted far more effectively. While this technology will not be cheap to import, it’s importance in national security can not be understated."
ANG_computing_experiments:0 "Equestrian Wizardry"
ANG_computing_experiments_desc:0 "The engineers of Equestria have developed a new piece of technology known as a computer. Its purpose was initially as a simple counting machine, designed to aid scientists with cumbersome mathematics. However, the technology has shown some promise in the world of espionage, with the ability to assist code breakers and secure our own lines of communication."
ANG_rocket_artillery_effort:0 "Diversifying our Firepower"
ANG_rocket_artillery_effort_desc:0 "Recently developments within the field of rocketry have allowed for smaller engines, greater effectiveness, higher reliability, and the ability to hold larger payloads. As such, the Angriverian Army has begun to look into the possibility of weaponizing rockets, using them to augment our traditional artillery batteries."
ANG_army_motorization:0 "The Grifftruck"
ANG_army_motorization_desc:0 "The Grifftruck is a rugged and reliable vehicle, designed by the engineers of Griffenheim to endure the rugged, barren, and chilly climate of Griffonia. Since it’s inception, the truck has become popular throughout the Griffon Empire, with licenses being snapped up across the various Imperial entities. The inclusion of this truck within our armed forces would greatly increase their maneuverability and speed."
ANG_proper_tanks:0 "Import Imperial Designs"
ANG_proper_tanks_desc:0 "Recently, the Imperial Army has begun to develop armoured fighting vehicles. These tanks, as they are called, are heavily armoured and can easily counter our infantry formations. The inclusion of a small number of tanks, to support infantry, or a large number, to act as independent combat units, would greatly increase the effectiveness of our army."
ANG_inspired_army:0 "A Defensive Army"
ANG_inspired_army_desc:0 "The new Angriverian army has been built upon the traditions of old, with a heavy focus upon the supremacy of being on the defensive in our doctrine. The goal of the Angriverian Army is to form a strong bulwark against foreign invasion via the rapid mobilization of our army into strong fortified positions."
ANG_superior_army:0 "An Offensive Army"
ANG_superior_army_desc:0 "While our army has traditionally fought on the defensive, recent developments in technology and doctrine have allowed us to seize the initiative. Our armoured spearheads will pierce the enemy’s ranks with the support of our advanced artillery, opening holes in the line which are newly formed motorized battalions can exploit. This is how a modern army was meant to operate."
ANG_military_academy:0 "Royal Institute of Military Affairs"
ANG_military_academy_desc:0 "The Royal Institute of Military Affairs, or RIMA, has been established within the city Appengen. The mission of this institution is to train a future generation of officers, house the Angriverian Army’s newly formed general staff, and develop doctrine on both the tactical and strategic level."

ANG_air_stuff:0 "Flying High"
ANG_air_stuff_desc:0 "Griffons were born to fly, to pierce the sky and enjoy true freedom. But despite the abilities granted by our wings, the limitations of biology have always prevented us from soaring too fast or too high. But with the latest innovations in airframes, we can shatter those limits, and griffonkind will know fewer limits in the sky than ever before."
ANG_fighter_projects:0 "Wings of Steel"
ANG_fighter_projects_desc:0 "Our current airframes are laughably outdated, and our first step in achieving dominance of the sky once more should be to update our fighter models. We have little to be concerned about from enemy planes if our fighters simply rip them to shreds after all."
ANG_doctrinal_development:0 "High Altitude Training"
ANG_doctrinal_development_desc:0 "Despite being more naturally suited to the skies than most species, excessive altitudes can still heavily hamper a griffon pilots capabilities in the field. By training our pilots at these extreme altitudes we can gradually wean them to the massive heights that they will have to endure as professional pilots, granting us a tactical advantage over our enemies."
ANG_actual_air_bases:0 "The Appengen Airfields"
ANG_actual_air_bases_desc:0 "While airplanes were never particularly popular in Angriver, there was the odd griffon known to own a plane back in the day. A defunct aerodrome now sits in Appengen, and its location makes it perfect to establish a new airfield upon. Our planes are little more than steel deathtraps with no place to land after all."
ANG_strat:0 "Strategic Bomber Effort"
ANG_strat_desc:0 "By striking our enemies critical wartime industries, we can potentially rob them of their abilities to supply their troops in the field with equipment. As the most critical industries are often the most well-guarded ones, a specialized type of bomber will have to be developed to carry and drop the bombs on our enemies industrial centers."
ANG_tact:0 "Tactical Bomber Effort"
ANG_tact_desc:0 "Why fire guns at our enemies from the ground when we can simply blow them up from the sky? By developing new tactical bombers to destroy enemy forces we can significantly damage our enemies divisions before they have a chance to engage with our ground troops."
ANG_napalm:0 "Napalm"
ANG_napalm_desc:0 "Napalm has proven itself to be a particularly useful tool during wartime. Burning at the same temperature as gasoline and for far longer intervals, as well as sticking tenaciously to its targets. This substance is almost perfect for its usage in payloads for our bombers, serving as a perfect weapon to use against structures and infantry."
ANG_CAS_projects:0 "Claws of Iron"
ANG_CAS_projects_desc:0 "Though they may lack the heavier payloads of our tactical bombers, our close air support frames still serve a vital role in our combat operations. By attacking and destroying smaller targets of opportunity during battle, close are support can easily turn the tide of battles if used properly."
ANG_heavy_fighter_projects:0 "Guarding Our Skies"
ANG_heavy_fighter_projects_desc:0 "In order to provide an effective escort for our strategic bombers, a new design of fighter must be developed. Sporting heavier armaments, and being all around heavier and less agile, than a regular fighter, these planes can comfortably escort our bombers. And will provide a  tough foe to all enemy interceptors seeking to destroy our bombers."
ANG_rocket_projects:0 "Rocketry Projects"
ANG_rocket_projects_desc:0 "While many consider them a novelty of warfare, rockets hold immense potential both as a means of propelling our aircraft and as a weapon in and of themselves. Investing in testing sites and new rocket designs is only prudent at this point."
ANG_paratrooper_project:0 "The Screaming Eagles"
ANG_paratrooper_project_desc:0 "Jumping from altitudes that even the bravest griffons would have considered insane only a few years ago, our elite paratroopers can handily land behind enemy lines to cause havoc. And as their equipment gets more sophisticated, their potential strategic and tactical uses increase as well."
ANG_expanded_bases:0 "Expand the Appengen Air Fields"
ANG_expanded_bases_desc:0 "To meet the demands of our expanding airforce, and to provide the nessicary capacity for further expansion, the already sizable airfields at Appengen must be expanded once more."
ANG_jet_fighters:0 "The V-1 Jet Fighter"
ANG_jet_fighters_desc:0 "After multiple prototypes and false-starts, the first ever viable model for a jet-powered fighter produced by our designers approaches. With even more investment we can enter into a new age of aviation, flying planes at speeds that would make the common griffon speechless."

ANG_industrial_stuff:0 "Salvage the Economy"
ANG_industrial_stuff_desc:0 "The economy of Angriver is at a pitiful state, with years of neglect and the presence of the many bandits and brigands having relegated us to the very bottom of the economic ladder. Indeed even amongst the other nations of the Heartlands, we come up pitifully short. The future of Angriver looks very dark indeed if we are unable to save it from this economic slump."
ANG_clearing_out_shitforest:0 "Reclaiming The Heartlands"
ANG_clearing_out_shitforest_desc:0 "Large sections of the Heartlands are covered in forests and are thus unusable for industrial development. Mass deforestation of areas near our few industrial centers will enable us to expand them further. And nobody liked the forests anyway."
ANG_electronics_research:0 "Electronic Experiments"
ANG_electronics_research_desc:0 "Electronics have proven themselves to be vital to any modern state. Indeed electricity has transformed nearly every facet of daily life, and nations are quickly making advancements in the field. If we are to ever reach the same heights as the economic powerhouses of Griffonia an investment in the development of our own electronics would not be unwise."
ANG_farmland:0 "Exploiting the Farmlands"
ANG_farmland_desc:0 "Vast areas of the Heartlands are not exploited to their full potential as farms. By expanding existing farms and sponsoring the construction of new ones we can greatly increase the food supply of Angriver, and well-fed griffons are happy griffons."
ANG_country_roads:0 "Railroads Across the Nation"
ANG_country_roads_desc:0 "Locomotives are finally starting to appear in Angriver, and the economic potential of these massive machines is undeniable. By laying railroads through the newly deforested areas we can encourage the usage and development of the vast plains of Angriver. This will also enable our military to move across the nation much faster than before."
ANG_green_gold:0 "Green Gold"
ANG_green_gold_desc:0 "A large vein of magical crystals has been discovered in Angriver, and currently lies unexploited. Extracting these crystals would require relatively little effort and the potential military applications of these crystals is enormous."
ANG_magic_boosts:0 "Magical Investments"
ANG_magic_boosts_desc:0 "The applications of magic in our industries have yet to be fully explored. Using magic to supplement our industrial base has the potential to provide massive boons across every sector of the economy, and we would be fools to ignore such potential."
ANG_mining:0 "Expanding the Mines"
ANG_mining_desc:0 "With the potential application of the magical crystals discovered in Angriver becoming more clear by the day, the true importance of this resource has started to reveal itself. Expanding the mines to fully exploit the veins that we have located within our territory should be our top priority."
ANG_power_of_the_gods:0 "The Power of the Gods"
ANG_power_of_the_gods_desc:0 "The recent discovery of magical crystals in Angriver has attracted many magical scientists to our capital, and through their collective work, we have caught a glimpse of the true power that lies within the crystals. While their theories have yet to be tested, the economic and military potential in these crystals is staggering."
ANG_connect_the_nation:0 "Connecting the Nation"
ANG_connect_the_nation_desc:0 "The state of the road system in Angriver is, to put it bluntly, abysmal. The vast expanses between the major population centers of Angriver are filled with roads that have not received maintenance in decades, and some areas only have dirt paths to guide travel. Modernizing and repairing the road system should be one of the first things that we do if we seek to save the economy."
ANG_griffing_industry:0 "Attract Heavy Industries"
ANG_griffing_industry_desc:0 "Angriver has never attracted much attention from investors, due to the little attention paid by the state to its industrial sector. But if we offer some generous benefits to potential investors Angriver would suddenly look a lot more attractive to prospective factory owners."
ANG_dierhoven_steel_mills:0 "Expand The Steel Mills of Direhoven"
ANG_dierhoven_steel_mills_desc:0 "Located in one of the few areas of Angriver that houses any heavy industry, the steel mills of Direhoven have operated for many years, supplying surrounding areas with Steel. While these mills are not producing enough to be useful at the moment, they could be extensively expanded with relatively little effort."
ANG_educate_the_people:0 "Educating the People"
ANG_educate_the_people_desc:0 "If we are to acquire a truly modern economy, the plague of illiteracy that has infested Angriver since time immemorial must be eradicated. We shall expand the educational system by providing generous benefits to schools, be they public or private, and by creating night schools for workers that desire to learn how to read."
ANG_our_own_oil_company:0 "Attracting Oil Companies"
ANG_our_own_oil_company_desc:0 "With Angriver becoming more industrialized by the day, the lack of oil in our territories has started to constrain our industrial expansion. To solve this problem we have made generous offers to several oil companies looking to establish refineries in Griffonia, the only thing left to do is finalizing the agreement."
ANG_arms_industry:0 "An Arms Industry of our Own"
ANG_arms_industry_desc:0 "Angriver has never sported a large number of military factories, with its army never truly needing a large number of weapons. But as we move into a new age of warfare, it has become clear that we need to expand our industrial capacity to meet the demands of a modern army."
ANG_automobile_industry:0 "Expanding Rubin Automobile"
ANG_automobile_industry_desc:0 "Rubin Automobile is one of the exceptionally rare companies founded in Angriver that is truly successful. Their cars have proven to be well designed and reliable, and they are currently seeking funding to expand their production to a new level. If we were to provide this funding we could secure a steady source of trucks for our military to use."
ANG_science_base_improvement:0 "A Modern Scientific Base"
ANG_science_base_improvement_desc:0 "Thanks to the recent strides that we have taken in the economy, we have found ourselves able to expand the research and development efforts of our scientists. While this investment will not put us at equal status with the scientific powerhouses of the world, it will bring us closer to having a modern science base."
ANG_land_grants:0 "Land Grants for Farmers"
ANG_land_grants_desc:0 "There are enormous barely settled areas of Angriver that have the potential to make for great farmland if exploited. By offering this land for a pittance to Griffon farmers looking to strike out for their own we can attract a large number of new immigrants. Not only will this increase the tax revenues that we collect, but many new griffons of military age will also immigrate to the nation."
ANG_village_education:0 "Village Education"
ANG_village_education_desc:0 "There are still many villages that lack any sort of educational facility, and thus a large number of our citizens are unable to fully realize their potential in society. We shall establish a special program aimed at finally bringing proper education to these villages, and in doing so we shall be rid of the last traces of the illiteracy that once plagued our nation."
ANG_national_bank:0 "The National Bank of Angriver"
ANG_national_bank_desc:0 "Angriver has no central bank, as it has never needed one in the past due to its poor economic base. But with the recent strides we have made in the industrial sector the lack of such a bank has started to constrict our further development. By establishing such a bank we will be one step closer to a truly modern economy."
ANG_industrial_projects:0 "Heavy Industrial Projects"
ANG_industrial_projects_desc:0 "There is still more land that lies unused for any industrial purpose in Angriver. More factories can still be constructed, and the existing ones can still be further expanded. We are so close to eliminating the economic woes that have plagued us for so long, we cannot stop now."
ANG_new_economy:0 "The Curse Broken"
ANG_new_economy_desc:0 "Factories now litter the landscape of Angriver, producing products that are loaded onto trains for transport across the whole continent. Only a few years ago such an image would have seemed preposterous to any griffon. After an immense amount of effort, we have finally managed to break the economic curse that has plagued Angriver for decades."

ANG_navy_stuff:0 "Founding a Navy"
ANG_navy_stuff_desc:0 "For the first time in our nation's history we have claimed coastline, the vast and terrifying ocean finally within our sight. Many threats lurk beyond the horizon, and we must prepare for their arrival and build ships of war. The locals will be able to aid us in this effort."
ANG_base_strike_f:0 "Strike at the Heart"
ANG_base_strike_f_desc:0 "The core of our enemies will not always be vulnerable to a direct attack. Often a nations true naval strength lies not directly in its Navy, but in the ports and dockyards which supply and repair it. But through the use of carriers and submarines, we can deliver crippling blows to this critical portion of our foes industry, while protecting our own."
ANG_carrier_f:0 "Carrier Experiments"
ANG_carrier_f_desc:0 "Carriers have the potential to completely revolutionize naval warfare. Through the combined might of the navy and the airforce, almost limitless tactical and strategic possibilities present themselves. But before any of that can be done, we need to actually develop a solid carrier model."
ANG_navy_planes_f:0 "Naval Aviation"
ANG_navy_planes_f_desc:0 "To deal with the unique challenges that come with carrier-based operations, new models and designs of planes must be developed. With each improvement to our carrier-based planes the strategic potential of our carriers increased, we would truly be mad to ignore this avenue of advancement."
ANG_fleet_being_f:0 "A Show of Force"
ANG_fleet_being_f_desc:0 "Our ports are the most critical part of our naval strength, as without them our navy would not last long unsupplied. By constructing a fleet focused on large battleships we can simply intimidate the enemy fleets, forcing them to stay away from our home waters while we build up the navy. And a few battleships certainly wouldn't hurt the national pride either."
ANG_dockyards:0 "A Home Port"
ANG_dockyards_desc:0 "To fuel our newly established naval efforts, a true home port is required. By constructing several new dockyards we can meet the demand for our navy, and provide a new destination for trade to arrive in our nation."
ANG_battlecruiser_f:0 "Bigger Ships"
ANG_battlecruiser_f_desc:0 "In order to stay competitive with the navies of other nations, we must constantly develop and expand our hulls. Bigger is better as they say, and we can certainly go bigger than our current models."
ANG_light_cruiser_f:0 "Light Cruisers"
ANG_light_cruiser_f_desc:0 "In order to meet the ever more stringent demands of our navy, our light cruiser models must be improved. The armor and armaments of our current models can almost certainly be improved, and if we have to break a few naval treaties to accomplish this, so be it."
ANG_battleship_f:0 "Battleships"
ANG_battleship_f_desc:0 "The pride of every nation, building and designing a proper battleship is a truly daunting task. But with the ever-expanding naval capacity of our nation combined with the latest advancements in naval technology have now made this feasible. The time has come to construct a true flagship for our navy."
ANG_expand_dockyards:0 "Dockyard Expansion"
ANG_expand_dockyards_desc:0 "Our ever-expanding navy now devours resources and manpower at a steady rate, and to meet this massive new demand multiple new dockyards will be constructed. A navy cannot exist without dockyards after all."
ANG_marine_f:0 "Create a Marine Core"
ANG_marine_f_desc:0 "The nature of modern war has rendered amphibious operations a necessity. Rather than throwing our normal forces at the beaches untrained and unready for their task, we shall create a new arm of the Navy specifically to deal with these landings, creating soldiers who can truly thrive in an amphibious environment."
ANG_transport_f:0 "Modern Transport Vessels"
ANG_transport_f_desc:0 "As our amphibious operations expand, the demand for new and better-equipped transport vessels does as well. By improving our existing designs we can deliver more soldiers to the battlefield faster and more efficiently than before."
ANG_trade_indirection_f:0 "Striking at the Lifelines"
ANG_trade_indirection_f_desc:0 "Against a truly overwhelming opponent, we cannot risk a direct confrontation. But the latest advancements in submarine technology provide another option. By constructing a large fleet of submarines and through developing new tactics based around these submarines we can simply cut off all trade to our enemies. A massive navy is of little use when there is no oil to fuel it after all."
ANG_destroyer_f:0 "Patrol Boats"
ANG_destroyer_f_desc:0 "Not every task requires the biggest guns in the navy. Patroling the coastline and supporting the larger ships are roles that are much better filled with smaller ships. By leveraging their small size and ease of production our destroyers might be able to punch above their weight class."
ANG_submarine_f:0 "U-Boat Experiments"
ANG_submarine_f_desc:0 "The potential to strike our enemies ships unseen, hunting their fleets across the oceans and waiting for the perfect moment to strike, is truly tantalizing. By conditioning new designs of submarines, we can better realize this potential."

We also cannot forget those who survived and are now scarred veterans. They will receive generous aid as a reward for their struggle."
ANG_local_councils:0 "Confederacy of Communes"
ANG_local_councils_desc:0 "The Barons always ruled over the municipalities of Angriver with an iron claw, refusing to let them have any freedoms. Much will now change as government is devolved and the state dissolved. We shall become a confederation of free autonomous communes, all voluntarily united under the banner of anarchy."
ANG_farms_for_the_farmers:0 "Farms For Farmers"
ANG_farms_for_the_farmers_desc:0 "Over the years the upper class hoarded vast tracts of land, claiming to own it all and demanding that serfs on their soil pay with tax or labour. No more! The land belongs to all of us! Rural communes shall work together to farm the land and share the produce with each other. Land cannot be owned by any single griffon, we all need it to survive. No more shall griffons hunger because of greed of others."
ANG_worker_control:0 "Seize the Means of Production"
ANG_worker_control_desc:0 "The anarchist revolution will now come from the countryside into the cities and towns where the industry of Angriver is located. Factories, mills, workshops, transportation services, public services, and utilities, all shall belong to all. No more wages, strict working hours or wealthy bosses. From each according to his ability and to each according to his needs!"
ANG_peoples_roads:0 "Connected Communes"
ANG_peoples_roads_desc:0 "During the Baron's rule the infrastructure on the countryside was compltely neglected. Now communes, eager to build new roads to make trade with each other easier, are cooperating on several construction projects. One isolated small village in the eastern hills even asked for aid which is being provided by their neighbours, meaning even the poorest and tiniest commune in Angriver will be connected."
ANG_anarchist_society:0 "An Anarchist Society"
ANG_anarchist_society_desc:0 "The last traces of private property, currency, feudalism and capitalism have been erased from Angriver. We have achieved true anarcho-communism. Some regard anarchism as impossible, undisciplined, uncontrollable. Yet production has increased, both in cities and villages, with workers eager to work for the greater good, knowing their comrades will provide anything they need."
ANG_anarchist_education:0 "Communal Education"
ANG_anarchist_education_desc:0 "Teachers and scholars long complained of having low wages and barely making a living. Now they earn no money at all yet work more eagerly than ever. Many comrades generously gift excess produce to them, valuing their contribution to society and rewarding them for educating their offspring and revealing the inner workings of the world. Knowledge is shared freely and no one guards it jealously."
ANG_build_support:0 "Embracing Anarchy"
ANG_build_support_desc:0 "Many griffons in Angriver have been corrupted by statist ideals and have doubts about living in an anarchist society. We must educate them on the matter and show them that we only want to ensure freedom and well-being for all. We should also tell them that abolishing private property does not mean they can't have personal belongings any longer."
ANG_matters_of_faith:0 "Do Not Fear Gods"
ANG_matters_of_faith_desc:0 "Long have priests preached that the Gods above judge them and give them strict rules to obey, while filling their temples with unfathomable wealth. This must change. Gods are not cruel despots, but our creators, and love us like any parents would love their children. Temples will be stripped empty of excess and the age of dogmatism ended. The Gods may be worshipped freely, without rules or laws."
ANG_syndicates:0 "Workers' Syndicates"

ANG_local_units:0 "Communal Militia"
ANG_local_units_desc:0 "The brutal statist weapons of the army and lawkeepers have been taken care of. But we still need to take care of our defence in case a foreign invasion threatens our independence. Therefore communal militias are forming, looting the arsenals and training for combat. The militiagriffs are motivated, for they are not fighting for their oppressive leader or for money, but for their homes and families."
ANG_local_armories:0 "A Gun In Every Home"
ANG_local_armories_desc:0 "The only way to ensure liberty of all and prevent the resurgence of oppression is to arm every single griffon.

ANG_the_march_of_progress:0 "The March of Progress"
ANG_the_march_of_progress_desc:0 "The economy of Angriver is in a truly pitiful state, and the National Republican party intends to improve it through a truly bold plan.

As Angriver cannot hope to achieve prosperity in these modern times without a modern industrial base."
ANG_rapid_industrialisation:0 "Rapid Industrialisation "
ANG_rapid_industrialisation_desc:0 "With massive subsidies for anyone willing to start a factory in Angriver, and generous private incentives from the party, Angriver has suddenly become a hotspot of industrialization.

ANG_pumped_up:0 "Preparing for the Worst"

ANG_proper_land_reform:0 "Proper Land Reform"
ANG_proper_land_reform_desc:0 "Land has never been properly distributed in Angriver, with most of it being owned by rich landowners or noble families. The Social Democrats intend to fix this historic injustice, but it is important to do so with the right methods. We must also address the inequalities that lead to this situation in the first place, and ensure that this reform is not carried out in a violent manner."
ANG_cooperate_with_syndicates:0 "Cooperation With the Syndicates"
ANG_cooperate_with_syndicates_desc:0 "While the syndicates and their anarchist allies did not secure ultimate control of Angriver, they are still a formidable force within the political landscape.

ANG_a_free_society:0 "A Free Society"
ANG_a_free_society_desc:0 "The Social Democrats intend to utterly transform the very fabric of society in Angriver, creating a truly free and just society in the process.

ANG_a_connected_nation:0 "A Connected Nation"
ANG_a_connected_nation_desc:0 "Angriver remains a disconnected nation, despite multiple attempts by the previous governments to bolster the infrastructure already present within the nation.

ANG_river_forts:0 "River Forts"

### Events ###
angriver.1.t:0 "Reclaiming the Land"
angriver.1.d:0 "The forests of Angriver have acted as a natural deterrent from settlement since time immemorial. The all-encompassing schweißwald having proven to be less than ideal for settlement. But all things must come to an end, and the Schweißwald has slowly but surely started to shrink. With each passing day more trees fall, more space is cleared, and more griffons move in. Small settlements slowly grow prosperous, increasing immigration to Angriver as free griffons look for a place to seek an honest living in Griffonia. These settlements and their accompanying settlers have a frontier spirit of sorts, and nothing seems to be able to stop their expansion."
angriver.1.a:0 "That's great to hear"

angriver.2.t:0 "Mysterious Sickness"
angriver.2.d:0 "Mining has quickly become one of the most lucrative industries within Angriver, as the demand for the magical crystals recently discovered within the region seems unquenchable. But it seems that these crystals might not have been the boon that they initially appeared to be, as a strange sickness has started to spread amongst the miners. This mysterious disease seems to strike healthy griffons without warning, and panic has started to spread amongst the miners.\n\nThe issue was brought to a head when a number of miners were trapped stuck within a crystal mine after a cave in. When they escaped a scant 18 hours later everything seemed fine, but soon after the sickness made its presence known. The survivors started to become fatigued and soon started to bleed. Their condition quickly deteriorated until they were seemingly possessed by some dark force, their limbs moving erratically while they begged incoherently for help. They were put out of their misery soon after."
angriver.2.a:0 "Could the uranium be the cause of this?"

angriver.3.t:0 "Urbanisation"
angriver.3.d:0 "With the recent expansion of the road system, the cities of Angriver have become attractive to industrialists looking to establish new industrial factories. With these factories come jobs, and griffons are now moving into cities by the thousands to work in the factories. Slowly but surely money, services, wealth and opportunities are centralized within the cities, and griffons from the countryside come to seek their fortune.  This rapid change has devastated some of the poor farming communities of Angriver, with many towns losing their youngest generations to the cities with frightening ease. In a few years, many of these towns will become abandoned. Their residents having left for the cities, leaving only broken homes and the relics of the past behind them."
angriver.3.a:0 "Good to hear"

angriver.4.t:0 "Education Campaign"
angriver.4.d:0 "Illiteracy has long plagued the people of Angriver, as for a long time being literate provided no real benefit to the common griffon. But as modernity encroaches upon Angriver, the problem has become too large to ignore. The state has started a large program aimed at eliminating illiteracy once and for all, and the fruits of this labor have begun to make themselves apparent. Mandatory schooling has finally been introduced, and night schools are provided at a low expense to workers willing to achieve literacy. This has proven to be a great benefit to our industrial sector as well as our research and development programs, as literate griffons are much more valuable workers than illiterate ones."
angriver.4.a:0 "The fight continues"

angriver.5.t:0 "Education Campaign Finished"
angriver.5.d:0 "Angriver has truly been transformed, as for the first time in the history of the region the majority of the population can safely be called literate. The battle was long and hard, requiring a large investment from the government. But the literacy program has succeeded beyond our wildest dreams, and the boons to the industrial and scientific sectors have been massive as well. The specter of illiteracy no linger hangs above Angriver, and it is a day for celebration."
angriver.5.a:0 "Finally!"

angriver.6.t:0 "The Ackerland Project"
angriver.6.d:0 "The Ackerland Project is a government initiative aimed at putting the vast spaces of Angriver to better use, offering benefits and subsidies to any griffon willing to move to the countryside to establish a farm. The project has become an unexpected success of late, with many griffons proving willing to establish a new life in the vast plains of Angriver. These new settlers have expanded the small settlements already present in the countryside, and some are even projecting that new cities will soon start to sprout up in the countryside."
angriver.6.a:0 "Great!"

angriver.7.t:0 "Hit and Run"
angriver.7.d:0 "With the recent roadwork going around Angriver, it was inevitable that the occupants of the Scheißwald would be disturbed. One of the villages near the forest had become a hotbed of unnatural activity during the construction. Villagers started to disappear in the middle of the night, the only clue as to their fates being bloody scraps of clothing on the edges of the forest. Reports of unnatural noises during the night created mass paranoia, and the villagers started to have nightmares every single night.\n\nThe town was paralyzed by fear, and many thought that they would die at the hands of this terrible monster. The source of all of these problems was a Lychen, which had been sneaking into the village to indulge its appetite for weeks. Then, after feeding on the terror of the villagers, it intended to consume every living thing in the village. During the night, it creeped out of the forest, approaching the perfect spot to begin its dark ritual. It stood unmoving in the darkness of the night and prepared for its ultimate victory.\n\nThen it was hit by a truck. Kunz Bartram had been on a routine trip to the village, looking to take a census of the surrounding region, and as he was running behind schedule he had decided to take an overnight trip to the village to save some time. He had also decided to start his trip right after consuming a copious amount of imperial beer. Needless to say, this was not a recipe for responsible driving.\n\nDue to a combination of low visibility, inebriation and a lack of sleep, Kunz proceeded to drive into the Lychen, or to be more accurate he drove over it. Due to a snag on the creatures frayed clothing, the Lychen was then attached to the underside of the truck. The poor creature was then dragged with his truck to the village, and due to his less than stable driving, what arrived at the village more resembled a bloody smear than a Lychen. \n\nWhen Kunz Finally arrived, he was declared the savior of the village by the townsfolk, and graciously accepted his reward in the form of more imperial beer for the road."
angriver.7.a:0 "Well... that's one way to handle a Lychen"

angriver.8.t:0 "Dorflehrer-Programm Paying Off"
angriver.8.d:0 "The recently established Dorflehrer-program has quickly started to bear fruits, as more and more griffons in the countryside are becoming educated. This has reinforced the belief of our people in the government, and many young griffons from the countryside have started to become politically active. The Dorflehrer-program has proven its worth, and griffons are already looking to expand it."
angriver.8.a:0 "Good"

angriver.9.t:0 "The Siege of the Zentralbank"
angriver.9.d:0 ""
angriver.9.a:0 "Victory!"

angriver.10.t:0 "A Long Day"
angriver.10.d:0 "Baron Leer had only just woken up when he heard the news, the emperor was dead. Leer had never possessed a very high opinion of the emperor, with the griffon seemingly embodying the very reasons for the decline of the empire. And yet, the news seemed almost unreal to him. The fact that such a towering figure, the supposed emperor of Griffonia, could simply die so suddenly and without any warning seemed inconceivable. \n\nThe death of the emperor required many things of him, and in truth, he had started to prepare for this eventuality a long time ago, as paperwork needed to be signed and the rabble informed. He had already established a straightforward plan for transitioning from one emperor to another, but as the day continued on he found himself unable to initiate it. He simply sat at his desk, unmoving. \n\nHe knew that he had to move forward with the plan, to sign the nessicary paperwork, to send a letter of his condolences to the imperial palace and to inform the rabble of the emperors passing. But as he sat at his desk he was struck by a question that he was unable to answer, a query that seemed to engulf all of his attention to itself.\n\nWhy?\n\nWhy should he continue on with his life? He had dedicated his life to this work, to the governing of Angriver. When the republican traitors sought to seize the region and plunge it into anarchy he alone had brought order. He had ruthlessly fought the remnants of the republicans and the anarchists, earning a reputation for brutality and efficiency. He should be proud of his accomplishments, he had done his job and done it well.\n\nAnd yet, he felt that if he continued on as he had for the past few years he would lose something vital. The best years of his life were fading, and he seemed unable to remember anything noteworthy in those years. And as the day slowly turned to night, the question remained in his mind, seeming to taunt him. And as the baron prepared to rest for the night, a feeling of dread seemed to engulf him."
angriver.10.a:0 "Time to sleep..."

angriver.11.t:0 "Dreamland"
angriver.11.d:0 "As baron Leer slept during the night, his dreams were troubled by something unnatural. The baron found himself suspended in a void of pitch black. He saw nothing, not even his own body, and yet he felt that something else was present with him. He was unable to move, unable to do anything except think, and the presence watching him seemed to grow larger with each second that passed. The baron found that a feeling of deep dread had taken a hold of his mind, and he somehow knew that whatever presence that was observing him would soon make itself known.\n\nAnd then, suddenly, he was falling. He still had no control over his own body and could do nothing to slow his descent. As he fell, his memories seemed to unravel around him, a lifetime spent serving a dying empire, a lifetime of blood and bitter struggle with nothing to show for it."
angriver.11.a:0 "Who are you?"

angriver.12.t:0 "A Friendly Conversation"
angriver.12.d:0 "It seemed as if he would fall forever, stuck with his own regrets in an eternal purgatory, but he was quickly proven wrong.\n\nHe found himself sitting in an elegant chair, the room around him was luxuriously furnished, and a cup of tea sat invitingly on the table before him. A voice suddenly spoke, despite nobody else being in the room, and the words echoed in his mind.\n\n"Hello, my dear son. Would you care to join me for a cup of tea?""
angriver.12.a:0 "Begone!"
angriver.12.b:0 "I could go for some tea..."

angriver.13.t:0 "A Cold Sweat"
angriver.13.d:0 "Leer was no griffon for moral grandstanding, he did his job and he did it well. He had never been a kind ruler, and he had never seen a problem with that. But this voice, this presence, it was pure evil. He saw only suffering and death in it, and he would not yield to such base impulses so easily. Summoning up all his courage, he told the creature exactly what he thought of its offer. \n\n"Begone creature, I have no time for your empty promises."\n\nThe very second he refused, the elegant room seemed to shift and transform. The furniture was engulfed in blood, and it seemed to writhe in unimaginable agony. The chair he sat upon also changed, contracting itself and trapping him where he sat. He felt something sharp stab into one of his hands, and soon all he could see before himself was blood and viscera. The voice did not reply to his refusal, and yet he could feel its fury all the same.\n\nSeconds later he found himself in his bed, unsure of the events that had transpired only moments ago. He was unable to rest that night, and yet he felt oddly rested the next day. He flung himself into his work with a new vigor, confident that his path in life had been the correct one. The dream seemed distant, and he would soon forget the momentary lapse in his conviction that had drawn it forth. The only thing that remained was a scar on his hand, one that he could never quite explain."
angriver.13.a:0 "What a horrid dream..."

angriver.14.t:0 "An Offer"
angriver.14.d:0 "Leer knew that this voice was unnatural, that it was evil. And yet he could not deny that its offer was tempting. This was only a dream, after all, nothing he did here would have any consequences in the real world. Right? With trepidation, he accepted the voices offer.\n\n"Well, I suppose it couldn't hurt, and I am feeling rather thirsty at the moment"\n\nThe very second that he uttered those words, he felt as if a heavy weight was resting upon his mind, with each and every second thinking clearly became harder and harder. But he could also feel that the voice was pleased, and this somehow made him happy as well.\n\n"Very good, my child. Everyone has to take a break sometimes, especially with the heavy demands that life makes of us these days. And you have lived quite the life, haven't you? All those days spent killing and governing, the long nights and the stressful days, and what do you have to show for it? Can you really say that your talents have been appropriately rewarded?"\n\nAs leer drank the tea, he contemplated the words of the voice. He had spent the best years of his life serving the empire, and yet he was still stuck here, governing some backwater barony filled with bandits and vagabonds. Surely he deserved something more.\n\n"I can feel your frustrations, and that is why I have contacted you. I have nothing but the best of intentions towards every single one of my children, and what kind of father would I be if I didn't lend a helping hand every now and then. You can become so much more Leer, we could do great things as partners, no?"\n\nLeer was tempted by the offer, he couldn't deny it. He had earned something more than his current life. But before he could accept, a strange feeling arose in the back of his mind, could he really trust this voice? He prepared to make his final decision."
angriver.14.a:0 "No... What am I doing?"
angriver.14.b:0 "I suppose we're partners now..."

angriver.15.t:0 "A Cold Sweat"
angriver.15.d:0 "As Leer contemplated the voices offer, he focused on the strange feeling that had arisen within the back of his mind. Somehow, the voice felt familiar. Like he had heard it before. And then, without warning, the horrific truth dawned on him. Visions of blood and death, of unimaginable suffering, of a nation of slaves dedicated to their own destruction, flashed before him. Whatever this voice, this thing promised, the price could not be worth it. He refused to believe that he would do such things.\n\n"Whatever false promises you make monster, know that you will never get your claws upon me. I won't submit to this savageness, begone foul creature, go back to the darkest pits of hell from whence you came."\n\nIt took all of his courage to speak those words, and the instant that he finished his sentence he felt the unadulterated fury of the voice in his mind. It had no need to voice its displeasure with words, he could feel its oppressive presence in the deepest corners of his mind. The room warped and transformed, becoming a horrifying visage of what it had been before.\n\nLeer awoke seconds later, unable to fully comprehend the forces that he had been dealing with only moments ago. He would never forget that night for the rest of his life, whenever he was alone he would watch the dark corners of the room like a hawk, and he would be plagued with nightmares to the day he died. And yet, despite the constant paranoia he now felt, he knew that he had avoided a much darker fate by only a small margin that night. And he would be forever thankful that he had returned to his senses during his discussion with the voice."
angriver.15.a:0 "Boreas' gold plated shaft!"

angriver.16.t:0 "Father's Love"
angriver.16.d:0 "In some deep corner of Leer's mind, he knew that this was wrong. He knew that the only thing that would result from accepting the offer of this strange creature was death and suffering on a massive scale. And yet, he couldn't find a reason to deny it. He would be powerful, respected, the masses would finally see him for the magnificent griffon that he was. With a trembling voice, he accepted the offer.\n\n"Very well, I suppose that makes us partners now"\n\nHe could feel the overwhelming joy of the voice in the deepest, darkest corners of his mind. It was overwhelming, he couldn't think clearly anymore. All he knew was that father would make him power beyond his wildest dreams. The pitiful rabble would worship him as a god, and they would pledge eternal allegiance to father through him. \n\nHis vision began to grow dark, with every second he could see less and less of the room. And in the very few seconds before he lost the last shreds of his vision, he heard the voice one last time.\n\n"Excellent, my dear child. Continue on as you have, for now, you will know what to do when the time is right."\n\nLeer awoke the next morning, and he knew that the dream had been anything but. Fathers love seemed to be all around him now, seeping into the walls and flowing through the air. Leer was filled with a new purpose and threw himself into his work. He had to bide his time for now, but when the time was right he would show the whole world the boundless depths of fathers love."

angriver.17.t:0 "Anarchist Raids"
angriver.17.d:0 "The Angriver Anarchist Union has been a thorn in the side of the government ever since the revolution of 978. While the anarchists were defeated along with the Republicans, the so-called Free State Army has continued to strike from the shadows ever since their defeat. The Free Army has recently escalated its attacks, and we seem as powerless as ever to stop them.\n\nPatrols from the military have started to disappear as of late, their mangled bodies found weeks later stripped of all valuable equipment. Several officers have been lost to car bombs and poison. This recent spurt of activity came to a head with a recent raid on a lightly defended armory, which proved disastrous for us. The entire garrison was slaughtered, and the weapons of the armory were all taken by the Free State Army. "
angriver.17.a:0 "Damn then!"

angriver.18.t:0 "Mysterious Murders"
angriver.18.d:0 "Dark clouds have gathered over Angriver as of late, with the populace living in constant fear and paranoia, many expecting that their next day may very well be their last. This atmosphere of terror was started by a string of mysterious murders. No griffon seemed to be immune, nobody was safe, anyone from the owner of a prestigious company to a lowly beggar could be next. The victim would simply disappear without a trace one day, with no clues as to what may have happened to them. \n\nThe bodies always surface sometime later, with some unfortunate griffon discovering a grizzly scene without warning. The hardest part is always identifying the body, or whatever is left of it. There is no way to determine a cause of death for the victims, as many seem to have been torn apart limb from limb, or killed in such a brutal way that barely anything remains to examine. The bodies themselves would appear in seemingly any location, with the most audacious one being discovered inside a cell within the headquarters of the police. With no leads the police have been unable to do anything about the murders beyond telling every griffon to maintain constant vigilance, and the government itself seems powerless against this unseen threat."
angriver.18.a:0 "Bloody Black Claws..."

angriver.19.t:0 "The Großmarschall'S Hunts"
angriver.19.d:0 "The vile monsters and bandits of Angriver have been a constant thorn in the side of the government, and their presence cannot be tolerated any longer. And now the brigands of Angriver have a name to fear, Großmarschall Othmar Stoiber. The Großmarschall has launched an incredibly effective campaign against the vile criminals of the region, with police raids on bandit strongholds and army attacks on monster nests occurring almost daily. The Großmarschall himself has enjoyed a massive boost in popularity with the common folk, and its hard to find a griffon with a negative opinion of the Großmarschall within Angriver."
angriver.19.a:0 "Good work Othmar!"

angriver.20.t:0 "Republicanism on the Rise"
angriver.20.d:0 "Many years ago, during the Republican revolution of 978, Angriver was plunged into chaos as the Republicans, Anarchists and Loyalists openly fought in the streets. But the revolutionary rabble was ultimately defeated, their ideals crushed, and the old order firmly secured by Baron Leer's decisive leadership during the crisis. With their republic relegated to a bunch of bandits hiding in the mountains, and with an emperor securely sitting on the throne in Griffenheim, the few remaining Republicans abandoned their ideals, leaving nothing but shattered tricolors and broken dreams behind them.\n\nMany thought that this would mark the end of the republican menace in Angriver. They were wrong. It seems that the republican ideals so cherished by the rabble did not die all those years ago. Like an infection, they have slowly grown in the shadows. This slow growth has finally reached a tipping point, and tricolors once again openly fly amongst the populace. The mob calls out for revolution, and it may only be a short time before their wish is granted."
angriver.20.a:0 "Here we go again..."

angriver.21.t:0 "Daggers in the Dark"
angriver.21.d:0 "Dark figures move in the night, their targets resting after a long and hard day of work. Their aim is to wrest control of Angriver away from the count and deliver it to the Republicans on the silver platter. The first attacks soon commence, with makeshift bombs going off in the barracks of the army, and militias moving to secure key government institutions. The fighting starts soon after. The garrison is bloodied, but they are better equipped and trained than the republican militia. The streets are consumed with a steel storm of gunfire, punctuated by large explosions rolling in the distance. As the Republicans move to attack the headquarters of the militia, the garrison moves to defend it. The fate of Angriver now rests on a knife-edge, and any faction could walk away victorious this night."
angriver.21.a:0 "The Traitors are beaten back"
angriver.21.b:0 "The Traitors wrest control of the Barony"

angriver.22.t:0 "The Großmarschall's Last Stand"
angriver.22.d:0 "The traitors now control the barony, their victory seemingly secure. But the location of the Großmarschall remains unknown to them, and they would surely panic if they knew where he was. Großmarschall Othmar Stoiber sits in the command seat of a tank, one of the few present in Angriver, and rides through the streets of Griffing with his personaly guard and whatever other loyalist remnants he could gather in tow. Their destination is the headquarters of the republicans, containing their officers and leaders. The complex itself is built like a fort and is well defended by the Republicans. \n\nThe Großmarschall intends to wipe out the leadership of the traitors with a single decapitation strike, aiming to inspire the crestfallen loyalists in the same act. As his forces reach the entrance to the Republican headquarters, the militia readies to attack his forces. The Großmarschall draws a sword and steps out of his tank. He intends to charge the headquarters of the traitors head-on with his men, their chances of success are slim. Whatever fate is ahead of him, the Großmarschall will meet it head-on."
angriver.22.a:0 "He is defeated as expected"
angriver.22.b:0 "The Marshal defeats the Revolutionaries!"

angriver.23.t:0 "A Bright Future"
angriver.23.d:0 "With the final remnants of the old regime finally vanquished, Angriver has been delivered firmly into the hands of the rebels. But the ultimate fate of Angriver has yet to be decided, as the rebels who overthrew the old government are far from united. The revolution was broadly carried out by two factions. These two factions now wage an invisible war of influence, both sides seeking to take absolute control of the revolutionary forces, while sideling the desires of the other faction.\n\nFirstly, there is the National Republican Party lead by Gerhard Bluhm. The NRP is the local branch of the leading party of the Griffonian Republic and is comprised of a broad coalition of various democratic ideologies. The National Republican party advocates for a free and democratic society, with the various parties that make up the faction intending to run for office once elections are in place.\n\nThen, there are the Anarchists lead by Willie Scherler. The Anarchists have been waging a guerrilla war against the government for decades, and their forces comprise a large amount of the revolutionary militias. They intend to turn Angriver into an Anarchist paradise, one that is ready to defend itself at any cost.\n\nAs the shadow war rages on, no griffon could say with absolute clarity which faction would triumph. Once again the fate of Angriver rests on the whims of fate."

When before landscape paintings and portraits of aristocrats were popular, now abstract art is being drawn, representing nothing at all yet everything at once. Bright colours, geometric shapes, emphasis on speed and dynamism.\n\nWith freedom, the griffons are Angriver can finally discover their true selves and express it as they wish."

The holy books were spared, but their fancy golden covers weren't. In the end, every religious building in Angriver was no different from a regular building. The loot was melted down into gold ingots which were then equally distributed to the communes. The gold could be used to acquire machines from abroad to boost our industrialization, and it seems the communes are already planning to do so.\n\nAny religious laws and rules once fervently preached by deluded fanatics were now ignored and Gods were worshipped freely in various ways. Some even abandoned the Gods and began offering votive sacrifices to forest spirits. Truly, faith had been liberated from its shackles."

He would receive no grand crowd to witness his dramatic, martyr-like death. No, instead he was dragged to a stenching shallow swamp, stripped bare of his expensive aristocratic clothing. His angry ranting at his executioners was swiftly silenced after a loud gunshot echoed in the woods. What followed was deep silence, then a loud splash as his wicked corpse was dumped into a muddy pond. Some of the anarchists spat on his corpse as they left."

 fantasyflavor.1.t:0 "Terror In The Countryside"
 fantasyflavor.1.d:0 "Attacks by monstrous beasts are nothing unusual in the countryside, and hardy commoners have no choice but to get used to it. Usually, monsters are driven off or killed as soon as they are seen, and sometimes they manage to injure or even kill a person or two. But worryingly, news have arrived in the capital of something much worse.\n\nWord has spread of a terrifying monster preying on lone individuals, mothers and even the young. It attacks, kills and feasts on flesh before disappearing into the night. There have been an alarmingly high number of such attacks reported in a small area. The locals are mortified, and their attempts to find the beast have been in vain. As casualties are mounting, they have now petitioned the government for aid.\n\nThe story of this beast is becoming popular, and many citizens now look to us, expecting us to help the victims. While this originated as a local issue, it has now gained attention across the country. If we do nothing, the populace will be disappointed."
 fantasyflavor.1.a:0 "We'll do what we can to help."
 fantasyflavor.1.b:0 "They can handle it themselves, surely."
 
 fantasyflavor.2.t:0 "The Beast Eludes Us"
 fantasyflavor.2.d:0 "After the petition for aid, we decided to hire the finest monster hunters in the land to go and slay the foul beast. However, in their latest report, the hunters say that they have failed to find the beast, as it leaves no tracks behind. Attacks on vulnerable individuals have continued and some are locking themselves inside their homes, refusing to even go outside.\n\nSpeculation has been rife across the country about the beast. Some say it is a Chimera, an Ophiotaurus or a Manticore, while others claim it might be a Bugbear, a Roc or even a fearsome Dragon. If the beast can fly, it would explain the lack of tracks. Intellectuals claim that it is merely a hungry wolf, nothing more.\n\nThe monster hunters are requesting more aid, and are even proposing a large-scale thorough sweep of the area by hundreds of armed persons. It would be an expensive operation, and some in the government are reminding us of the sunk cost fallacy and say we should just give up, though this would greatly harm our reputation."
 fantasyflavor.2.a:0 "Send in the army!"
 fantasyflavor.2.b:0 "This is a waste of time."
 
 fantasyflavor.3.t:0 "The Beast Is Slain!"
 fantasyflavor.3.d:0 "After we sent a sizeable number of soldiers to help the monster hunters, the area was searched thoroughly and any possible hiding places of the beast were torn down. As the area was surrounded, the beast could not escape on land, and sentries were positioned to guard the skies day and night, preventing it from flying away.\n\nAs the operation was nearing its conclusion, the beast was finally found and slain. Or well, it was a group of beasts. The hunters identified them as Pukwudgies, small, colourful and spiked creatures with large, fanged mouths, resembling porcupines in appearance. Their size explains the lack of tracks and their large number explains the number of attacks. According to the soldiers, all such beasts in the area have been exterminated, and the locals should be safe.\n\nThe public is pleased, yet also disappointed. The beast seemed far more threatening when it was an unknown danger. When it was revealed to be a pack of small hungry pukwudgies, some even expressed sympathy for them, thinking they were simply trying to survive, and that they could've been captured easily instead of being killed."
 fantasyflavor.3.a:0 "Well, it's finally over."
 
 fantasyflavor.4.t:0 "The Beast Is Slain, Again"
 fantasyflavor.4.d:0 "After the pukwudgies were exterminated, the monster hunters and the soldiers left the area, and the locals returned to their normal, routine lives.\n\nOr so they thought.\n\nOnly a few days after the sweeping operation, the beast attacks continued like before. The commoners were terrified, yet knew that the government was unlikely to help a second time, and that the public didn't care about them now that the danger had been officially declared to be over. So they decided to deal with the beast themselves, acquiring weapons and making sure no one was ever alone in the wild.\n\nEventually, one group of them was attacked when it was dark, but they were carrying a torch. It was thrown at the beast which burst into flames and perished. The charred remains of the creature were presented to the local governor, who then showed it to a cryptozoologist. They identified the beast as a rogue Timberwolf, a wolf-like creature made of twigs, logs and branches. They are rare outside of the Everfree Forest, but have been spotted elsewhere in the world on occasion. Due to their lightweight body, they leave no tracks.\n\nAfter the incident, the beast attacks ended for good, and the area returned to peace and tranquility."
 fantasyflavor.4.a:0 "How awkward..."
 
 fantasyflavor.5.t:0 "A Curious Discovery"
 fantasyflavor.5.d:0 "Word has spread quickly in the country about unique creatures that were found in the outskirts of [Root.Capital.GetName]. They are small, colourful and round creatures with insect wings as well as large, endearing eyes. The locals who discovered them have been enamoured with them and told about them to their neighbours, which is how the news began to spread.\n\nNow many individuals are flocking to the place where the creatures were found to take a look at them. The discoverers are apparently giving them out as pets in exchange for valuables. It is uncertain how they captured so many of them, but it seems like the creatures are easily tameable. Some, however, have already noticed how the creatures have a voracious appetite for food.\n\nThe yet unnamed creatures are becoming a countrywide craze, but it will likely blow over soon, once the discoverers have traded off all them."
 fantasyflavor.5.a:0 "They do seem like nice pets."
 fantasyflavor.5.b:0 "They might be dangerous, confiscate all of them at once!"
 
 fantasyflavor.6.t:0 "The Infestation"
 fantasyflavor.6.d:0 "Apparently, the craze surrounding the strange new creatures, now commonly known as Parasprites, has not died down. In fact, they seem to be everywhere now, and their hunger has no limit. It has been reported that they reproduce asexually and rapidly, consuming everything edible they can. In one isolated case, a parasprite was locked up in a cage and given no food, which resulted in the creature simply consuming the cage. They are truly omnivorous, though seem to prefer regular food when possible.\n\nIt is estimated there are thousands of parasprites on the loose, raiding pantries and even emptying public food stores. The commoners are doing everything they can to deal with the pests, killing them with tools or even using fire, but the parasprites reproduce too rapidly. This seemingly harmless fad has become a threat to our homeland!"
 fantasyflavor.6.a:0 "We have to do something!"
 
 fantasyflavor.7.t:0 "An Unexpected Salvation"
 fantasyflavor.7.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, it seemed like we were unable to save our food stores as the parasprites simply ate their way through any walls or doors no matter the material. Any pesticides have been proven useless as well. Famine seemed inevitable as our citizens lost hope.\n\nThen, a wandering band of musicians arrived, and hearing of the plight of our country, decided to play a mournful song in the middle of our capital. They gathered quite the crowd of gloomy commoners, but also parasprites, who seemed to be enthralled by the music. Realizing this, the band of musicians began marching around, attracting more and more parasprites, and soon our citizens made their own improvised musical bands to attract parasprites from as many places as possible. The pests were then led outside of settled areas to the edge of wilderness where they could feast as much as they wanted.\n\nThe country was saved and the band of musicians were regarded as heroes, but they left our country as soon as the parasprite problem had been dealt with, refusing any awards or accolades. Despite our best efforts to track down these mysterious minstrels, we have been unable to do so."
 fantasyflavor.7.a:0 "Well, it's finally over."
 
 fantasyflavor.8.t:0 "A Scholar's Request"
 fantasyflavor.8.d:0 "A famed scholar petitioned our government recently to aid him in his magical studies. He said he was planning to conduct an elaborate and expensive experiment to confirm his theories on magic, and wouldn't be able to do it on his own. The experiment will be risky, he warned, but worth the reward if it were to succeed.\n\nWhile some claim this would be a misallocation of our resources, it might be a gamble worth taking. The scholar in question is well known for his genius in magical studies and a breakthrough would provide us all with valuable knowledge about the esoteric laws of magic."
 fantasyflavor.8.a:0 "What's the worst that can happen?"
 fantasyflavor.8.b:0 "It's not worth the risk."
 
 fantasyflavor.9.t:0 "Catastrophic Failure"
 fantasyflavor.9.d:0 "After we granted the scholar everything he needed for his ambitious experiment, we didn't hear much from him, assuming he was busy with work. But earlier today, a large explosion rocked the capital, leveling dozens of houses and workshops around it! Unnatural blue fires then spread and caused even more damage, and could not be extinguished with water. One magical expert recognized the flames and told us to pour pure alcohol on them, which indeed worked and the flames were quenched. But the damage was already done and hundreds had perished.\n\nInitial investigation quickly revealed that the center of the explosion was in the laboratory of the scholar we had aided. It seems their magical experiment had disastrous consequences, and that everything we invested into it went up in blue flames."
 fantasyflavor.9.a:0 "This is a disaster!"
 
 fantasyflavor.10.t:0 "Successful Experiment"
 fantasyflavor.10.d:0 "After we granted the scholar everything he needed for his ambitious experiment, we didn't hear much from him, assuming he was busy with work. However earlier today he finally contacted us, submitting a lengthy report on the experiment, its results and his observations. He also said he was going to write a tome based on the experiment and its groundbreaking revelations in the field of magic, which would then be published for all to read.\n\nA few individuals are upset that the scholar is "demystifying" magic and even claim him of blasphemy, but they are in the minority. Most folk are happy with the news and are already imagining a future where magic is entirely tamed and mundane, fully in our control and used to make everyone's lives better and easier."
 fantasyflavor.10.a:0 "Wonderful, truly."
 
 fantasyflavor.11.t:0 "Blue Moon Festival"
 fantasyflavor.11.d:0 "Today, griffons around the world gathered to celebrate the annual Blue Moon Festival. Originating in Griffonstone, this traditional winter holiday is said to be "the only time of the year when griffons are nice to each other". Families put aside their feuds for a day and come together to exchange gifts, decorate their houses and enjoy a delicious meal consisting of griffon scones, warm eggnog and gold gruel. Even during wartime, griffons prefer to take a break from the fighting and are often granted leave so they can visit their homes.\n\nWhile sharing much in common, the celebration differs from the Equestrian Hearth's Warming Eve by having religious connotations, not commemorating a historical event and lacking theatre plays. It is said the festival is a celebration of all griffon gods and divine unity in the pantheon, especially between the three main gods, Boreas, Eyr and Arcturius. Over the years, the Archonates have tried to push the event to focus on the three main deities alone, but especially in peripheral regions, lesser deities are still venerated. Indeed, different griffon communities celebrate the festival in different ways, with traditions becoming more exotic the further away from Griffonstone you go. In recent times, the festival's religious importance has eroded and it is becoming primarily a cultural event, celebrating the common heritage of griffonkind."
 fantasyflavor.11.a:0 "A toast to family and unity!"
 
 fantasyflavor.12.t:0 "Maarite Cult Uncovered!"
 fantasyflavor.12.d:0 "Recently, our security forces investigated an anonymous hint about a secret Maarite cult that discreetly held meetings in our capital and have now managed to track them down. The cultists were raided as they were holding a gathering and were arrested.\n\nMaarite cults appear from time to time, but constant vigilance usually manages to keep them at bay, forcing them into hiding away from mainstream society. However, the fact that a sect was gathering in [Root.Capital.GetName] is worrisome, and might indicate that it was merely a single cell of a larger organization. Unfortunately, interrogations of the prisoners yielded few results. Further investigations have already been launched to cleanse the taint before it spreads too wide.\n\nAs is custom, Maarites are executed as soon as possible, but in recent times some citizens have called this action cruel and are requesting we simply imprison them instead and keep them under constant surveillance."
 fantasyflavor.12.a:0 "Execute them all immediately!"
 fantasyflavor.12.b:0 "Just lock them up in prison."
 
 fantasyflavor.13.t:0 "A Daring Escape"
 fantasyflavor.13.d:0 "The Maarite cultists had been locked up in a high-security containment facility, kept in solitary confinement and were under constant 24-hour surveillance. Yet all these efforts were internal, and external security was lacking.\n\nNow alarming news have arrived that a group of cultists broke into the prison from the outside and rescued almost all imprisoned cultists. Fifteen prison guards have been found dead, vivisected and lacerated in brutal ways, and four guards were wounded. One guard is suffering from severe mental trauma and has been sent to an asylum.\n\nThis event is a clear indicator that the Maarite cult is indeed larger than it initially appeared. While this will help us track down those cells and exterminate them, it has caused unease among the populace and already rumours are spreading, making the situation even worse. Efforts are being made to calm the citizenry, though this will take a while."
 fantasyflavor.13.a:0 "Those who know no mercy deserve none."
 
 fantasyflavor.14.t:0 "A Strange Discovery"
 fantasyflavor.14.d:0 "We have been informed of an unusual item found by a group of curious younglings, who were exploring a cavern in a small garden near their home. It was shown to local officials, who gave the little ones some sweets as a reward and then sent it to us.\n\nIt is a strange, golden artifact, resembling a crown and adorned with glowing stones. It emanates with magical energy that can clearly be felt in its vicinity. The headgear was inspected by a professional mage, who concluded it was ancient and powerful, though further study would be required to truly unveil its secrets.\n\nSome are proposing we simply display the gorgeous item publicly, so the commoners can admire it. Others say that is too risky and say we should give the "crown" for mages to examine. Perhaps the artifact could prove useful for fulfilling our goals?"
 fantasyflavor.14.a:0 "It belongs in a museum!"
 fantasyflavor.14.b:0 "Perhaps it'd be wiser to study it first..."
 
 fantasyflavor.15.t:0 "A Popular Attraction"
 fantasyflavor.15.d:0 "After we placed the golden magical artifact on public display in our capital, with proper security measures of course, it initially only attracted a few curious visitors. However, as word spread, more and more citizens arrived to admire the object and experience the tingly feeling emanating from its magical aura. Soon enough, even individuals from abroad started appearing, travelling to our nation just so they could see the famed item for themselves.\n\nSo far, admission to see the item has been free of charge, but with how many visitors are coming, it might be needed to impose some fees or limitations. Thankfully, no harmful side effects from the artifact have been spotted yet, so it seems to be harmless to admire from a safe distance."
 fantasyflavor.15.a:0 "We can profit from this!"
 
 fantasyflavor.16.t:0 "Unforeseen Consequences"
 fantasyflavor.16.d:0 "For a while now, a group of magical scholars have been studying the golden artifact, trying to avoid breaking it down. They have conducted various experiments on it, starting carefully but getting more daring as time went on.\n\nAt one point, a test subject was asked to wear the crown, as the scholars wished to see what would happen. This, however, proved to be a mistake. The person who wore the crown seemed to have gained powers of mind control, and their personality shifted too. Soon, they had magically enslaved the scholars, and then went out of the laboratory to dominate the minds of anyone they could find. Thankfully, it seemed the crown had limited range and could only control so many individuals, but the crown-wearer then approached the residence of [Root.GetLeader], apparently wishing to take control of our nation's leader. A guard on duty, seeing the approaching strange group of shambling, brainwashed individuals, was equipped with an expensive foreign rifle. She aimed at the crown-wearer and pulled the trigger, killing him. In an instant, the spell was broken and the mind-controlled persons snapped out of it.\n\nThe guard has been awarded a medal and promoted, while the crown has been sealed in a secure underground cavern. Hopefully, it won't be found by a group of younglings a thousand years from now."
 fantasyflavor.16.a:0 "Let's not meddle with artifacts from now on."

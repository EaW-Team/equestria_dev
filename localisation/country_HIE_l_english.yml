### Focuses ###
HIE_CTH_a1:0 "The Stars Are Right"
HIE_CTH_a1_desc:0 "The age of strife has begun my brothers and sisters, the stars have aligned and the battle for the soul of equinity has begun. But the corrupting forces of the Avian are always at work, and will not let us ascend beyond this world so easily. So we must continue to fight until final victory is achieved."
HIE_CTH_a2:0 "An Indomitable Will"
HIE_CTH_a2_desc:0 "The enlightend are the vanguard of the new age, those who know the truth of the Avian scourge form the core of our efforts. Unfortunately, until we can uplift our fellow equines, we cannot fully trust them in our ranks. Our forces shall stay small and elite for now."
HIE_CTH_a3:0 "The Power Of The Equines Of Silver"
HIE_CTH_a3_desc:0 "The wise and powerful Equines of Silver are the warriors of our new society, they are learned students of the Star Father and know his words and universal law. It is their spiritual power that shall allow them our armies to purge the plagues that afflict our land."
HIE_CTH_a4:0 "Strike At The Heart Of Evil"
HIE_CTH_a4_desc:0 "How the mighty Colthage has fallen when entrusted to the heathen Zarishat, the Right Hoof of the Demiurge. Selfish and wicked, she let the Avians into our homes for her own power and wealth, abandoning the great spirit of equinity and becoming one with the will of Za'al-Maar. But her general, Monzano still remains, carrying on her corrupting work. She must be purged."
HIE_CTH_a5:0 "March Upon The Crypto-Avians"
HIE_CTH_a5_desc:0 "A new corruption is rising in Colthage. Criminals, mercenaries, and souls seduced by the lies of Za'al-Maar have banded together under a crypto-Avian named Zarza. Bent on enforcing soul theft upon all of the equines of colthage and preventing them from reaching ascension. His forces are spread out however, and if we act fast he may quickly fall."
HIE_CTH_a6:0 "The Exalted March Of The Aspirants"
HIE_CTH_a6_desc:0 "The Aspirants are those who have begun to walk the path of truth, they believe they are ready to join one of the legions and serve their master and the Star Father. But first they must prove themselves by slaying the Avian scourge and wiping it from this land."
HIE_CTH_a7:0 "The Bloody Trial Of The Cohorts"
HIE_CTH_a7_desc:0 "The Cohorts wish to begin their journey to the truths of this world, but they have even farther to go than the Aspirants. They must enlighten themselves, achieve wisdom in the face of Za'al-Maar's corruption, and shed the blood of the enemies of equinity."
HIE_CTH_a8:0 "Wage War Upon The Soul Thieves"
HIE_CTH_a8_desc:0 "Soul theft, the disgusting chains of the material world, keep us bound to this realm. The "economic systems" of the world are nothing more than methods of seduction by which equines are kept in chains. So while we still exist in this cursed plane, we must end this process of theft and seize all material for the Covenant war effort."
HIE_CTH_a9:0 "Exalt The Equines Of Bronze And Iron"
HIE_CTH_a9_desc:0 "Those who craft, making the best they can of this material world we are trapped in, are worthy of respect within the Ascendancy. While they do not contribute directly to the destruction of Za'al-Maar, their refutement of soul theft and the goods they create for the cause are more than worthy of recognition."
HIE_CTH_a10:0 "The Wisdom Of The Equines Of Gold"
HIE_CTH_a10_desc:0 "The Equines of Gold are the wisest among us, those who have knowledge of the ways of the spirit world, and who can see clearly through the lies of the servants of Za'al-Maar. They are our leaders, our guides and teachers. Those who shall lead Equinity back to the prophesied spirit world. And the Star Father stands foremost in their ranks."
HIE_CTH_a11:0 "Uncover The Tools Of Resistance"
HIE_CTH_a11_desc:0 "Upon the fall of the Arch-Heathen's regime, her army shattered as soul thieves descended upon our land. Weapons, imported by the cartels, were scattered throughout the land like dust in the wind. We must find these chaches and turn them against the wicked souls who hold us down."
HIE_CTH_a12:0 "Nourish The Bearers Of The Future"
HIE_CTH_a12_desc:0 "The old are often too corrupted by the influence of the Avian to truly understand The Teacher's words. But the young, the young have not yet lived a life in a world controlled by the Avian. They can learn, they can grow into the subjects the Ascendancy needs."
HIE_CTH_a13:0 "Rebuild The Hearths And Homes"
HIE_CTH_a13_desc:0 "The home is the core unit of our new society. It acts as a sanctum where equines may live and practice their craft away from sinister forces. But the hearths have gone out in the war, we must rebuild for the good of our subjets."
HIE_CTH_a14:0 "Bring About The End Of Soul Theft"
HIE_CTH_a14_desc:0 "No more shall the souls of the equines be corrupted by the Avian! These economic systems of the modern age are nothing more than ways the Avians tie us to this realm. Capitalism, the lecherous tumor of the Avian empire begat communism, just another way for the Avians to control us. We refute these ideas! We refute their mental slavery!"
HIE_CTH_a15:0 "The Gift Of Compassion And Benevolence"
HIE_CTH_a15_desc:0 "The wise patricians of the equines of gold have graciously opened their purses to assist in the rebuilding of colthage. The lower castes must be cared for in this time of crisis and in all their wisdom, we shall rise to the occasion."

hippone_sekrit.1.t:0 "The Price Of War"
hippone_sekrit.1.d:0 "They stood atop a wooden stage, the design of which spoke more to function than form. An Equine of Gold stood before a podium, flanked by a team of Equine of Silver, all resplendent in the garb that denoted their lot in life. A scroll lay before him, upon which lay a proclamation passed down from the Star Father himself.\n\n"It has come to the attention of the Covenant," the Equine of Gold declared in a sonorous voice, "that deviant soul thieves have been working within the city of Zapsa, hoarding their great wealth to use against the good equines living within."\n\nFrightened murmurs broke out amongst the crowd as the masked legions of the Star Father marched a group of two dozen zebras into the center of the square. They were beaten bloody, but were easy to identify as prominent industrialists and their families who had made the city their home.\n\n"These creatures," the Equine of Gold spat, heedless of the clamoring that grew before him, "have attempted to subvert the purity of our kind by engaging in the decadent vice of capitalism. They have tried to pervert the will of the equine to that of the avian, and in so doing, let the promise of the Star Father fall to ruin."\n\nThe battered zebras were marched from the square into waiting trucks, which departed with a single word from the leading Equine of Silver.\n\n"Thus, the wealth of these creatures shall be turned against them and what they represent. Their treachery shall be used against their crypto-avian masters to the west, and we shall prove the purity of the Equine kind once and for all!""

hippone_sekrit.2.t:0 "Body And Mind"
hippone_sekrit.2.d:0 ""Hear me, and rejoice oh spirits of equinity! You have the privilege of being saved by the great Star Father! While you may now experience suffering, soon, your souls will be pure. Accept these gifts from your Lord and Teacher." The mare paced slowly down the street of the ruined village, preaching to the masses of terrified and starving hiding within the alleyways. "By his wisdom, we equines of gold, silver, bronze, and iron are here to lift you up to the level of true equines."\n\nThe mare stopped as she came to what appeared to be the town center. Turning around, she stood up straight, the sun illuminating her suit jacket in the dusk glow, and began to speak again, "I am Jezalla Zaalatit. Equine of gold, and servant of the Star Father. I have come to offer relief to you all. As the chosen spirits, you all have a chance to refute the will of Za'al Maar. We offer you the chance to become what you are meant to be. You need only to submit to the teachings of the Master. The equines of silver shall distribute the food, approach them if you are ready to swear your lives to His teachings."\n\nAs she finished, zebras began limping out of the stores and houses that dotted the square. Each one was directed by an equine of silver to a group of equines of bronze and iron. They reported their craft, their family size, and their education. Those who may be warriors were taken on the spot to see if they were worthy of studying the arts of the Grandmasters. All others were sent to collect their charity."
hippone_sekrit.2.a:0 "Maybe the Star Father isn't so bad..."

hippone_sekrit.3.t:0 "A Safe Haven"
hippone_sekrit.3.d:0 ""Hear me, and rejoice oh spirits of equinity! You have the privilege of being saved by the great Star Father!" The mare walked at the head of a vast procession into the destroyed city of Zapsa. The city's modern architecture long since destroyed in the civil war. Hooves beat against the stone roads in a rhythmic pounding as the rows of zebras entered the city's limits, towards the large gathering.\n\n"You all have been brought here to witness something glorious, the equines of silver have brought you here to show you the teachings of the Star Father in action." Gesturing to the zebras gathered behind her, she declared, "These are the equines of bronze and iron, the craftsmen of the Ascendency. They shall be those good souls who will rebuild your city. And within a month's time, you will live in new homes. A city rebuilt in the image of pure equinity. Many of you shall join their ranks someday, and if you can become talented enough at your craft, you shall achieve enlightenment and ascend as a true spirit of equine perfection. But that is many years of practice away. For now, give thanks to the Star Father, for he is the one who has given you the chance to save your soul!"\n\nOn queue, the equines of iron and bronze began a round of thunderous applause to the speech, and the audience slowly followed. The preacher stepped away from the crowd as a masked equine of silver approached her, "You did well, Jezalla. I'll take it from here and ensure corruption is purged from the city."\n\nJezalla turned to him and nodded, "You best follow through on that Aspirant Zakob. You failed the Star Father once when you failed to kill that Avian agent. You shall not fail again." The aspirant gulped and nodded before turning to his soldiers, "Protect the equines of bronze and iron. Kill any corrupted who resist their work.""
hippone_sekrit.3.a:0 "At least we've got rooves over our head again"

hippone_sekrit.4.t:0 "A Field Of Temples and Souls"
hippone_sekrit.4.d:0 ""Hear me, and rejoice oh spirits of equinity! You have the privilege of being saved by the great Star Father!" Jezalla Zaalatit walked amongst a camp of tents and beds, preaching to the injured, sick, and dying. "While the avians have harmed your physical form, they can never damage your soul, that spirit that makes you an equine. A fragment of the Godhead from which we all came."\n\nStopping at the bed of one wounded zebra, Jezalla held her hoof as her leg was stitched together, her screams of pain only silenced when the nurse, and equine of bronze and iron, stuffed her mouth with a gag of willow bark and cotton. The nurse then turned to her and spoke with hushed concern, "Lady Zaalatit, this mare will not survive without alchemical treatment. But only a bit of wound-sealer would guarantee her life. Could you or one of your assistants fetch it?"\n\nJezalla scowled at the nurse, "Do not speak so casually to an equine of gold! You shall be forgiven for the care you show to your work, but do not make the same mistake twice. I shall fetch the treatment." Leaving at a canter, Jezalla approached the largest tent in the field and swept aside the entrance flap, revealing a mare in a lab coat with bright purple-dyed hair and stripes. Upon seeing her, Jezalla briefly kneeled before standing and addressing her, "I apologize, miss. I did not know you would be here. I hope I did not interrupt your work." The zebra turned around to her and handed her a bottle, "Not at all, Jezalla. I think you'll be needing this for that patient. Now run along. I have more work to do."\n\nJezalla took the bottle and began to trot back to the patient's bed, not bothering to question how the mare knew why she was there before she arrived. As she left, a hooded figure approached the tent. Entering the tent, the stallion walked up just behind the mare. Looking over, she smiled briefly and turned to face the stallion, "Ah, Grandmaster of Pleasure, have you come for some potions?" The stallion pulled back his shawl, revealing sunglasses and a gauze mask, "Unfortunately not. While I love using your concoctions for my experiments, I am here to give you a summons to Hippone. The Star Father wishes to meet with The Guide once again."\n\nThe mare straightened her back and paused for a second before responding, "Then tell him I'll be there as soon as I can. I must always answer my teacher's call."\n\nThe Grandmaster nodded and went to leave, before turning back. "Oh, bring your alchemical supplies. He has uses for them.""
hippone_sekrit.4.a:0 "The Guide and The Teacher together."

hippone_sekrit.5.t:0 "The Auspicious Government"
hippone_sekrit.5.d:0 "The host of the Equines of Gold stood before him at rapt attention. Before him lay a message from the Star Father himself, a sanctified missive that had been penned by his holy hoof. He was but a mere Equine of Gold himself, not quite a master, and thus it was a great honor to have been selected to proclaim these great words.\n\n"Fellow equines, rejoice!" he bellowed, his voice echoing about the amphitheater. "You have all been selected to serve the great Covenant with the dignity befitting your status. He calls you here to act in servitude to your kind, to do what you were born to do."\n\nAs he glanced about the crowd, his eyes settled on a cloaked figure surrounded by Masters of Silver. A striking purple mane was all that could be seen beneath the cloak. She was here. He knew not if the omen was auspicious.\n\n"Rejoice, I say to you!" he continued, unabated, "for you shall be sent to adulate the Star Father's great name! You will be sent to the towns, and the cities, and the hinterlands, and you shall rule in his name against the avian kind. You shall be the bastion that stands before the subtle corruption of the avian, and you will not falter. For this, the Star Father places his faith in you."\n\nWordlessly, the host of the Equines of Gold came before the speaker to receive their assignments. He looked to the crowd, but he could no longer spot the shock of purple among them."

hippone_sekrit.9.t:0 "The Price Of Art"
hippone_sekrit.9.d:0 "TODO - Flavour event about Colthage being rebuilt in a weird artistic baroque style by POWs who are "redeeming" themselves through labour. Needless to say the Covenant are not exactly being magnanimous following their victory. Those who can't work are killed, and they're generally overseen by Equines Of Bronze and Iron and Equines Of Silver who are enforcing their orders"

hippone_sekrit.10.t:0 "The Ascendancy"
hippone_sekrit.10.d:0 "TODO - Event about the Covenant finally stabilising their hold over the nation giving it complete dominion and control over the lands of former Colthage.

hippone_sekrit.14.t:0 "The Rejection Of Temptation"
hippone_sekrit.14.d:0 "TODO - Event about a book burning overseen by the Preacher-esque character established before, the books being burned are primarily books from Griffonia or Hippogriffia, but there's some Socialist and Communist literature being burned there as well.

hippone_sekrit.15.d:0 "TODO - Event about the renovations of the city of Zur - Fancy Neo-Baroque Architecture mixed with traditional Colthaginian (Mexican) architecture, plenty of parks and what not - Overall it looks very nice and the people of the city are actually happy about it going out to celebrate a joint fiesta regardless of their Castes and social standing."

hippone_sekrit.16.t:0 "The Masters Of Finance"
hippone_sekrit.16.d:0 "TODO - Event about Hiram, abolishing banking and decreeing that the Equines of Silver kill every single private banker in the country, with their assets being seized by the Ascendancy's bureaucracy so that it may be redistributed - A large chunk of these bankers actually supported the Ascendancy during the Civil War being Patricians or Ex-Patricians themselves, so this event does show that the country has stablised to the point that Hiram can have the Covenant's membership pruned when he wishes"
hippone_sekrit.16.a:0 "It was inevitable"

hippone_sekrit.17.t:0 "In The Court Of An Equine Of Gold"
hippone_sekrit.17.d:0 "TODO - Event about an Equine of Gold who got appointed as the supreme judge of Neigheris handing out justice - Not sure what the case should be, but the event should highlight that he's making an effort to be harsh but fair, that being said the punishments the Ascendancy hands out are all fairly horrendous, ranging from mutilation and brandings for minor offences and executions for bigger ones."

The Zynskaites want to section off large chunks of the jungle and turn them into wildlife preserves while letting nature take its course.

hippone_sekrit.20.d:0 "TODO - Event about pearl harvesting in Qatrain. The Zynskaites want to more or less stop the pearl harvesting in the area because jewelry is a frivolous luxury and the harvesting operation would be more useful for collecting clam meat. The Zidonites on the other hand are arguing that it would be for the best if the pearl harvesting operations were both expanded and integrated into the wider Colthaginian pearl harvesting operations."

Zynskaites want to turn the entire island of Zjerba and the sea that surrounds it into one big natural resort which can then be used for propaganda purposes and to give vacations to various well performing citizens of the Ascendancy. The Zidonites don't really see a reason to turn Zjerba into a natural resort when the reefs are already protected and are basically arguing that the protection of the reefs should be codified but that the island should be developed further economically to not be as uselss as it is at the moment"

They're all confused for a moment but they all quickly decide that it worked and that Hiram has actually managed to mantle the Godhead, transcending beyond mortality and escaping the cycle of life and rebirth that traps Equinity in the material world and giving them an entity that will be able to fight Za'al Maar in the immaterial world.

However it should be noted that due to the sheer diversity of the §rCovenant§!'s leadership, the form this new model economy shall take is still a matter of intense debate.\n\nThe first amongst these factions are the £faction_tur_kurdish §rZynskaites§! led by the Trotkartian equinepologist §rQarnaim Sikarbaalid§!. This faction takes their name from the infamous Zeblu prophet Zynskai, whom ordained that cosmopolitanism and all of its influences must actively be fought against lest the Zeblu are to be destroyed. Thus the £faction_tur_kurdish §rZynskaites§! preach a return to the arcadian lifestyle of the original Zebras, traditional guild based production, the downsizing of urban areas and most importantly of all the militarisation of every aspect of society.\n\nTheir chief rival is the £civ_factory_output §rZidonite§! faction headed by the famed §rZurite§! mathematician §rZisa Zaalatit§!. Their name is an homage to the alleged legendary founder of §YColthage§!, Queen Zido under whom the city began its meteoric rise to the forefront of Zonician politics. As the name suggests the faction is primarily based upon the principles of urban modernisation, reinforcing the §rAscendacy§!'s already existing caste system and the maximisation of the country's industrial and economic output.\n\n£faction_tur_kurdish §rZynskaite§! economic influence is: [HIE.GetAgrarianPopularity]\n£civ_factory_output §rZidonite§! economic influence is: [HIE.GetUrbanitePopularity]\n\nSetting the §YEconomic Policy§! of a state is irreversible will unlock additional §YEconomic Projects§! in said state based upon the selected policy.

However, whether the key to englightenment lies in §rTransmutation§! or not is irrelevant, the only thing that matters is that the §rAscendancy§! is the first nation in history to master the art on an industrial level.\n\nThrough the power of §rTransmutation§! we will be able to convert any type of §YResource§! in any core §Ystate§! we own and control to another §YResource§! in accordance to a set of §rTransmutation§! formulas. Additionally, once certain landmarks are reached we will be able to transmute the §YResources§! in any non-core §Ystate§! we own, as long as the §YCompliance§! in said §Ystate§! is above §Y40%§!\n\nTransmutation Formulas:\n      - §YOil§!

Through the master of the ancient art of transumation they have managed to figure out a way to transform the magical essence of our enemies into §YCrystals§!, which will then be stockpiled in the city of §YColthage§! in preparation for the Divine Teacher's §rAscension§!\n\nEvery §Y10,000§!

hippone_aspj_flavor.1.desc:0 "Zateo was too small, he couldn't see past the cheering throngs between him and the rhytmic thumping that the grand parade produced. Maybe he could try further along the route? Looking around, Zateo caught a look at a tiny back alley that the crowds were avoiding. Perfect! This was his way to get farther ahead in the parade. Dashing down the alleyway, Zateo thought of what he would see. The famed equines of silver in their masks, sacrificing their individualities to serve the grand ideas of the covenant! Of course, Zateo didn't quite understand what that all meant, but he knew he should be proud of them.\n\nRounding the final corner, Zateo bounded up a small hill to exit the alley before his hoof caught on a rock jutting out the side of a building. Tripping over, Zateo came crashing down on his front right knee, scraping it badly and causing it to bleed profusely. As he tried to stand, Zateo could only wince in pain as he watched the blood seeping into the cobblestones. On the edge of tears, Zateo began to call out, "Help! Please, I'm hurt!" But no creature was around. Every loyal citizen of the Ascendency was at the parade. So the young zebra curled up and tried to apply pressure to the wound. It wouldn't be fatal, he thought, but he'd be there a while.\n\n"Well, what's this then?" Zateo turned to face the new voice. Looking from where he came, he saw a hooded zebra mare holding a satchel over her shoulder. "That looks painful. Would you like some help?" Eager to get out of the situation, Zateo nodded as the mare walked over and pulled off her hood. As she applied gauze and an alchemical tonic to his knee, all he could notice was her deep purple-colored mane.\n\n"There, all done!" she said after applying the potion. Watching the wound heal at incredible speed, Zateo could scarcely believe his eyes. "Now then, try to be more careful next time."\n\n"Wait!" Zateo called out as she went to leave, "I haven't caught your name, good miss, my father would want to know who had healed my wounds."\n\nThe mare turned back for a second, before pulling up her hood and simply saying, "No one. Just a helpful guide." And then just as quickly as she had come, the mare was gone."
hippone_aspj_flavor.1.a:0 "Well, thanks miss!"

hippone_aspj_flavor.2.t:0 "Fate of the Damned"
hippone_aspj_flavor.2.desc:0 ""Useless Za’al-Maar afflicted avians," the officer muttered. "Twenty-one god damn hours, and he still refuses to talk." Taking off his mask, the officer walked over to his chair in the Colthage Municipal Securities division office. The military police of the city of Colthage. Kicking a trash can by his desk over, the officer plopped himself down with a huff, and he went to the paperwork at his desk. This Avian had been found with government documents trying to flee the city. He wished from deep down inside his heart that he could just end the hippogriff's life, but orders from the top said he needed info. Shaking his head, he could still hear his partner going at it in the other room. The prisoner's wail's of pain brought him some joy, at least. If the Avian wouldn't talk, they'd just hurt him more.\n\nLooking down at his paperwork, he was shocked when he looked up to see a hooded zebra in front of him. Shooting up, he grabbed for his sidearm before he recognized the face under the hood. The purple-haired zebra.\n\n"Ah, I see you finally noticed me." She quipped. "I had hope that the city's defenders were a bit more alert."\n\nThe officer inhaled and exhaled slowly. He was in a foul mood, but now was not the time to mouth off to an equine of gold, "I apologize for my failure, miss. What brings you to our station?"\n\n"Orders from the palace of the teacher. That prisoner is to be transferred to my care immediately. My squad will be here tomorrow morning at 09.00 to pick it up." And then, as quickly as she came, she was gone.\n\nThe officer smirked and then began to chuckle. That's what that prisoner deserves! Everyone knows what happens to those who go with the purple-haired zebra! They become soulless husks of themselves before they finally meet the fate of all Avian scum. Serves him right for not answering their questions. If endless torture is a fate worse than death, then there are no words to describe her cursed embrace."

hippone_aspj_flavor.3.desc:0 "Hidden away in a corner of the sufrital palace in Colthage was a room that had been used to entertain guests. It was large, empty, and had a skylight. At least, that's what she remembered about it. Pulling back her hood and releasing her purple mane, The Guide got a better look at the door. It was simple, but she knew that the Star Father's personal lab was behind it. The equines of silver and gold which had escorted her here were instructed to leave when they were a full forty paces away. Knocking three times, The Guide took a step back, not sure of what would happen. She had met Hiram before, but not like this. This was an official summons, entirely different to what she was used to. As the door opened, The Guide was shocked, but not for the reasons she thought she might be.\n\n"Ah, my dearest Guide! Come in, come in!" Hiram smiled warmly and invited The Guide in. He was disheveled and dirty, covered in muck and stains, but it soon became apparent why as she entered, too stunned to speak. Hiram had converted the room into a mixture of a laboratory and a greenhouse and was tending to his plants when she arrived. "Apologies for my appearance," Hiram muttered to himself, "I must have lost track of time."\n\nThe guide was shocked but managed to sputter out a few words, "My teacher, you must rest! The nation relies on you being of sound mind."\n\nHiram glared at her, "Are you insinuating I am not of sound mind?" But before The Guide could even respond, Hiram waved a hoof at her and continued, "Don't worry, I know you meant it as a joke. Just have better taste next time." Moving around the room, Hiram stripped himself of his gardening apron and gloves, returned to The Guide, and sat her down at a chair by his desk, looking far more official.\n\n"Now, my good Guide, I have a task for you." She nodded, "Anything you command."\n\nHiram smiled and continued, "I have a dream, a dream of alchemy on a scale never before attempted. Potions that could change the very forces of reality. All the power of the fragments of the Godhead, fractured into the races of equinity, their pure essence made manifest into concoctions, mighty weapons to smite the avian!" Hiram's voice began to peak, booming with the rhetoric of all his lectures. "I believe that these potions, all of them at once, could together form enough of the essence of the Godhead that an individual, pure of spirit and ascended in mind, body, and soul, could truly become one with the spirit realm again."\n\nHiram paused, and turned to The Guide, "Will you help me?""

But there's a very strong pull that I sense, gravitating and enticing me to travel to the city of Hjortland and uncover its secrets.\n\nIt may not be an ingredient, but from what it looks, the city seems like a good 'vantage point' of sorts, where I can hone in my powers and let this gift guide me to further the Teacher's goals, and to find more ingredients as is my goal for the foreseeable future.\n\nIs the Guidance pulling me to the north?"

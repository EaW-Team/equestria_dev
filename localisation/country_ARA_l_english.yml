ARA_legacy:0 "The Legacy of Arantigos"
ARA_legacy_desc:0 "Once, long before the Empire, long before even Equestria and her Princesses Arantigos Featherin ruled a realm that stretched from Midoria in the South to Romau in the North.\n\nAnd yet here we are, the pathetic remnants of a once mighty Kingdom whose King was feared and respected by Ponies and Griffons alike, but not all is lost. For within the heart of every Arantigan lives the same spirit that once guided the greatest conqueror Griffonia had ever seen!\n\nAnd even if we are now but a mere shadow of our past selves that spirit still guides our armies emboldening them as it once did the mighty Arantigos."
ARA_economic_dependance:0 "Economic Dependence"
ARA_economic_dependance_desc:0 "While the Arantigan Economy was not as badly affected by the fall of the Griffonian Empire as the rest of Griffonia due to our economy's close ties to the Wingbardians and the rest of the Karthin Pact.\n\nIt is quite clear however that due to this Wingbardy exerts a massive amount of influence over our economy."

### Focus ###
ARA_the_new_airforce:0 "The Birth of the Airforce"
ARA_the_new_airforce_desc:0 "The world is changing around us. No longer do Griffons have to fly with their wings alone; powerful engines allow us to soar through the skies. We should invest in the military applications of this technology, lest we fall behind."
ARA_new_fighters:0 "Dominate the Skies"
ARA_new_fighters_desc:0 "Bombers are quite good and all, but they are quite useless without anything to protect them. As such, we should focus our efforts on creating the best guardians for Arantigan skies."
ARA_further_development:0 "Experimental Fighters"
ARA_further_development_desc:0 "The possibilities of jet engines are fascinating. We should try to adapt this technology to our military."
ARA_new_heavy_fighters:0 "Heavier Models"
ARA_new_heavy_fighters_desc:0 "Our fighter designs are proving to be a success, but we need fighters with the range of bombers. Sacrificing agility for endurance, armor, and weapons may be the solution."
ARA_airports:0 "Sparletan Airfields"    
ARA_airports_desc:0 "Our planes cannot fly if they have nowhere to be stored and launch from."
ARA_foregin_designs:0 "Import Foreign Fighters"
ARA_foregin_designs_desc:0 "Given the small industry we have at our disposal, it would be better to start our airforce by buying some planes, rather then relying on building our own. We can improve on them later, after all."
ARA_napalm:0 "Napalm"
ARA_napalm_desc:0 "They can't keep the war up if all their factories are in flames."
ARA_finest_aces:0 "The Finest Aces"
ARA_finest_aces_desc:0 "A superior training program will ensure only the best fly in our planes; our pilots will be the cream of the crop!"
ARA_new_bombers:0 "Salt the Fields"
ARA_new_bombers_desc:0 "Regular bombers are good, but what we need are heavy duty warplanes; bombers that can take a beating and still survive to drop their payload. That is where the future of aeronautics lay."
ARA_new_closer_air:0 "Guard Our Troops"
ARA_new_closer_air_desc:0 "Coordination between air and land has clear tactical and strategic benefits; creating aircraft designs specifically to aid the boots on the ground will make them grateful for the wings above."
ARA_new_heavy_bombers:0 "Strategic Destruction"
ARA_new_heavy_bombers_desc:0 "Bombing key enemy positions; supply depots, railways, you name it, will require specialized planes. Designing some should be a priority."

ARA_issue_of_economic_dependance:0 "Dealing with the Economy"
ARA_issue_of_economic_dependance_desc:0 "Arantiga's economy is frankly in a pitiful state, and we must see to the matter of solving this issue if we wish to become a world power."
ARA_our_own_way:0 "Our Own Path"
ARA_our_own_way_desc:0 "Arantiga must forge its own path. If we do not make ourselves economically independent, we will be, beyond our obligations in the Pact, forced into wars with them. As such, it is time to begin cutting ourselves free from the claws of Wingbardy's Industry."
ARA_build_roads:0 "Arantigan Railroad"
ARA_build_roads_desc:0 "If we are to become an industrial power, we will need the base infrastructure for it. Preparing ourselves for the great leap forward is a must if we are to be economically separate."
ARA_industrial_buildup:0 "Industrial Buildup"
ARA_industrial_buildup_desc:0 "More factories can only benefit us. Therefore, it is logical we should center our efforts on expanding our industry."
ARA_mining_operations:0 "Ores in the Hills"
ARA_mining_operations_desc:0 "With the recent location of new metal deposits in Arantiga's hills, we can open up additional mines to secure more resources for our economy."
ARA_import_machinery:0 "Import Machinery"
ARA_import_machinery_desc:0 "We will need tractors, trucks and other industrial machines to help fuel our growing industry. Purchasing some is an excellent solution to help us meet our material needs."
ARA_foreign_experts:0 "Invite Foreign Experts"
ARA_foreign_experts_desc:0 "Not only will allowing foreign exports to examine our economy benefit it, they will also help with the pandemic illiteracy rampaging around our nation. Incentives, however, will be required to attract them to Arantiga"
ARA_industrial_revolution:0 "Industrial Modernisation"
ARA_industrial_revolution_desc:0 "With all our buildup, we can move ourselves away from our backward technology and into the age of industry proper!"
ARA_transition_finished:0 "The Economy Reborn!"
ARA_transition_finished_desc:0 "With the recent improvements to our economy complete, we can finally declare ourselves our own economic power, if, a small one."
ARA_go_with_wingbardians:0 "Go With the Wingbardians"
ARA_go_with_wingbardians_desc:0 "Our economy is already closely tied to Wingbardy. It only makes sense that we should therefore build up our ties and use them to our advantage. While this will, of course, make us dependent on Wingbardy, there are clear benefits to it as well."
ARA_vinyards:0 "Expand Alubviran Vineyards"
ARA_vinyards_desc:0 "Wine is a common luxury, enjoyed throughout Griffon Lands and beyond. As such, it is in constant demand. Expanding our already present vineyards in Alubvira should help our economy prosper."
ARA_tourism:0 "Encourage Tourism"
ARA_tourism_desc:0 "Tourism is a wonderful thing. Ponies and Griffons and even rarely, Zebras come to visit and marvel at the wonders of our achievements. Encouraging them so that they come to spend their money in our country, therefore, is an excellent way to bring more money into our economy."
ARA_tax_incentives:0 "Invite Investors"
ARA_tax_incentives_desc:0 "Investors will be needed to bring money and business into our growing economy. Inviting and offering incentives to them should allow our economy to blossom."
ARA_cement_factories:0 "Sparletan Limestone Cement"
ARA_cement_factories_desc:0 "Opening new factories to produce more material will help both our economy and industry; providing new jobs and industrial power both."
ARA_industrial_assistance:0 "Request Industrial Assistance"
ARA_industrial_assistance_desc:0 "Arrogance has to be a thing of the past; we must be humble if we seek to gain power to place ourselves on equal footing with Wingbardy. Requesting assistance to develop and transition our economy is therefore a must."
ARA_cigars:0 "Pontels Cigar Factory"
ARA_cigars_desc:0 "Cigars are an excellent investment; not only are they used constantly, but they are easy to produce and will keep the citizenry placated."
ARA_equals:0 "A New Path"
ARA_equals_desc:0 "Our economy is reborn! Thanks to the cooperation of our allies, Arantiga stands tall and proud. Our economic ties to them bind us all together."
ARA_science_base:0 "Modernisation Efforts"
ARA_science_base_desc:0 "With a developed industrial base, we can now devote our efforts toward scientific matters."

ARA_new_age_new_army:0 "New Age, New Army"
ARA_new_age_new_army_desc:0 "We are entering a new era of warfare. Gone are the days of the spear and shield. Here and now is the age of guns and tanks. We must choose where we stand, and ensure we do not fall behind."
ARA_new_academy:0 "Examine the Officers"
ARA_new_academy_desc:0 "Once, we were the greatest nation on Griffonia. The ancient military doctrines need to be adapted to modernity. Our officers need to be reinstructed with a mix of classic and modern works about warfare. After that it is time to develop new doctrines, and adapt to the ever-changing ways of war."
ARA_mobile_warfare_doctrine:0 "Unimagined Speed"
ARA_mobile_warfare_doctrine_desc:0 "Tanks, jeeps, and trucks are all new inventions that are changing the shape of warfare. While the trenches of old stand tall and strong, these mechanical beasts lumber forth, destroying all who dare stand in our way. It is clear that adopting such a doctrine will only benefit us in the long run."
ARA_develop_doctrine:0 "Lead from the Front!"
ARA_develop_doctrine_desc:0 "It is said Arantigos favoured to lead the mobile wing of his army from the front. He did not fear danger and neither should our officers. If we are to adapt the risky manoeuvres that come with our doctrine, we need to show the troops that our officers are not afraid to lead them into battle themselves!"
ARA_cult_of_speed:0 "A Cult of Speed"
ARA_cult_of_speed_desc:0 "Speed is the deciding factor in warfare. If you can decide where to fight and who you face when, you have already won half your battles. And if we can push forward faster than they can retreat, then our enemies have no chance against us."
ARA_actual_trucks:0 "Unit Motorisation"
ARA_actual_trucks_desc:0 "Armoured, motorised infantry is an ideal the Great Conqueror himself never had access to. If one unit can act both as a hammer and an anvil, exploiting gaps and keeping an enemy in place, we should make haste to reform our army into such a force."
ARA_tanks_for_the_army:0 "Knights of the New Age"
ARA_tanks_for_the_army_desc:0 "In the past, great Knights with great armour battled against beasts of legend and the enemies of their nations. Now, it is clear that these Knights, while inspirational, are quite outdated. We must adapt to the times, or be left behind."
ARA_better_tanks:0 "Rolling Out"
ARA_better_tanks_desc:0 "Our armoured behemoths are ready to go forth and destroy our enemies. The tank has been revealed as a great weapon of war, which can multiply the strength of an army in the hands of a great tactician. Our foes will find that Arantigan tanks will outmanoeuvre and outfight anything they can bring to the battlefield."
ARA_superior_warfare_doctrine:0 "Fire From a Distance"
ARA_superior_warfare_doctrine_desc:0 "Arantigos Featherin himself already appreciated the use of weapons with longer range then your opponents. A very simple truth still rings true even into this millennium. They cannot pose a threat to us if they are dead before they get to us."
ARA_develop_superior_doctrine:0 "Safe and Sound"
ARA_develop_superior_doctrine_desc:0 "We will defeat the enemy safe and sound in our bunkers while our artillery rips them to shreds. None will stand in our way. There is no reason to throw away Arantigan lives without reason, since any Arantigan is worth ten times that of another soldier."
ARA_mass_artillery:0 "Massed Artillery Fire"
ARA_mass_artillery_desc:0 "Through the use of massed artillery fire, we shall not only annihilate the enemy's fighting spirit, but also wreck their defences. The following infantry charge will see little to no resistance. The Great Conqueror himself used this tactic to great effect, disorganising the enemy’s front line and then trampling over them with a charge."
ARA_better_artillery:0 "Modern Artillery Pieces"
ARA_better_artillery_desc:0 "The days of catapults and ballistae are but legends. Gone are the days of star-shaped forts and cannons. Technology marches forward unrelentingly and in this new age, we have howitzers and bunkers. We must make sure we keep up with all new developments."
ARA_fancier_guns:0 "Preparing the Vanguard"
ARA_fancier_guns_desc:0 "Having all these big guns are virtually useless if we do not have the means to protect them. Even with all these new weapons, the Arantigan soldier is still the mainstay of the army. We should ensure that he is equipped with the best weapons that money can buy."
ARA_continous_planning:0 "Dedicated Officer Core"
ARA_continous_planning_desc:0 "With our big guns now being the central philosophy of our army, we should ensure our officers are able to put them to use, as well as assigning officers to these artillery crews so they are more efficient."
ARA_new_school:0 "The Sparleto Military Academy"
ARA_new_school_desc:0 "The ancient Academy in our Capital has become the domain of dust and paper rot! But with our officer corps in place, we can turn the old grounds into a bustling hub of military knowledge once again. The spirit of conquerors still dwells in our people and with proper study, that spirit will manifest into its fullest potential."
ARA_new_guns:0 "Guns For the Troops"
ARA_new_guns_desc:0 "Even with artillery and tanks aplenty, the core of warfare will always truly be the brave infantry who risk their lives out there. The least we can do is make sure they are all armed properly."
ARA_new_artillery:0 "Cannons of the New Age"
ARA_new_artillery_desc:0 " With these new massive guns, no enemy will be able to hide from our might. No pillbox, no trench, no fortification will be able to stand up to the salvos of our guns. We will force them to face us on even ground!"
ARA_new_equipment:0 "Sturdy Shovels"
ARA_new_equipment_desc:0 "An infantryman cannot defend himself if he has no hole to hide in. Improving our support equipment should be a priority. An Arantigan infantryman should be able to march for days while fully packed. Surely they can carry an extra shovel or first aid kit."
ARA_spec_ops_program:0 "Forze Speciali"
ARA_spec_ops_program_desc:0 "Unconventional warfare is the deadliest. Using new tactics, we can surprise our foes with special operations. We merely need to plan the way we will fight."
ARA_nation_under_arms:0 "An Armed Society"
ARA_nation_under_arms_desc:0 "Tensions are rising rapidly all around us. It is clear that we cannot afford to stand back and watch the world burn. We must arm ourselves. Once, the entire nation was mobilised for conquest and if necessary, we can militarise again."
ARA_prepare_the_people:0 "Is a Polite Society"
ARA_prepare_the_people_desc:0 "Our griffons will not need to stay home and protect their families. They can join the army, since they know that in a militarised society, all those who stay behind will be protected as well."
ARA_the_cadets:0 "The Giovani Cadetti"
ARA_the_cadets_desc:0 "The Cadetti are a branch of Arantigan military scientists, tasked with developing new weapons for the military. We should expand their ranks and make sure to also task them with civilian projects if necessary."
ARA_guerilla_warfare:0 "No Surrender"
ARA_guerilla_warfare_desc:0 "Surrender is the cowards’ path. We will fight to the death. Every last Arantigan will brave the perils of war, or die trying."
ARA_mandatory_training:0 "Implement Mandatory Military Training"
ARA_mandatory_training_desc:0 "We cannot afford for everygriff to remain a civilian. Everyone must be ready to be conscripted if it is needed. Therefore, all griffons should be trained in the ways of war, so that new recruits can quickly be prepared for combat, should the need arise."
ARA_radio_stations:0 "Military Frequencies"
ARA_radio_stations_desc:0 "If you know what your enemy is up to, you have already won half of the battle. Although spies remain important, new technologies will allow us to see the world far more clearly. We should make use of this."
ARA_extensive_coscription_laws:0 "Expand Conscription"
ARA_extensive_coscription_laws_desc:0 "Our military is quite small, and as such, we need a greater proportion of bodies watching the borders. Updating our conscription laws should serve to fix this issue nicely."
ARA_military_railroads:0 "Is a Functioning Society"
ARA_military_railroads_desc:0 "A militarised society should use military precision and drill for every aspect of life. Much more can be pushed out of our infrastructure if we enforce exact timetables and sober use of seating on trains. This will effectively increase our infrastructure’s capacity."
ARA_builder_divisions:0 "Divisioni di Lavoro"
ARA_builder_divisions_desc:0 "The Divisions of Labour are a group of military engineers. These engineers specialise in constructing and maintaining the industry and infrastructure of our nation, military and civilian. It is time to give them the support they need to be more effective."
ARA_reservist_housing:0 "Reservist Housing"
ARA_reservist_housing_desc:0 "Building more barracks for our troops will allow us to significantly expand our army. A soldier who knows he is well housed, will have one less thing to worry about besides fighting."
ARA_fortified_nation:0 "Hunker Down"
ARA_fortified_nation_desc:0 "Compared to quite a few, our army is small, but elite. As such, we must secure every advantage we can that will inflict greater losses on the enemy for less of ours. It is time to dig in."
ARA_stocked_arsenals:0 "Stock the Arsenals"
ARA_stocked_arsenals_desc:0 "We cannot fight if we do not have guns. We need to make sure everygriff in our army is supplied and ready."
ARA_mobilized_economy:0 "Mobilise the Economy"
ARA_mobilized_economy_desc:0 "Our economy, while reasonable, is also mostly civilian. We must mobilize it and make it ready for war. A modern war is won on the homefront and if we are to win heroic victories, we should be supplied with legendary weaponry."
ARA_legendary:0 "Making Arantigos Proud"
ARA_legendary_desc:0 "Look at us now; mobilized and ready for war. We are ready to reclaim our birth right and take our destiny into our own hands. Arantigos would be proud! We march again!"
ARA_unmatched_army:0 "An Army Without Peer"
ARA_unmatched_army_desc:0 "None may claim to hold the same standards as the Sparletan people. Ours is an army rich in history and powerful, ready to take on the world in Arantiga's defence. The spirit of the ancient conqueror lives anew amongst our ranks. Glory to Arantiga!"

ARA_the_aftermath_of_the_coup:0 "The Aftermath"
ARA_the_aftermath_of_the_coup_desc:0 "The dust has settled after the coup Dorotheos launched. The only question; did it succeed?"
ARA_coup_prevented:0 "Margareth's Victory"
ARA_coup_prevented_desc:0 "Dorotheos has been defeated, and they have been arrested, awaiting their fate. It is obvious we cannot govern like before. Changes to the government must be made!"
ARA_army_purges:0 "Retire the Disloyal"
ARA_army_purges_desc:0 "Given the support Dorotheos had, it is essential that we make cuts to the disloyal parts of our military, or this may happen again."
ARA_deal_with_dorotheos:0 "Dorotheos' Trial"
ARA_deal_with_dorotheos_desc:0 "Dorotheos has been brought to court on grounds of high treason, and faces either death, or life imprisonment. There is no chance of clemency for them."
ARA_more_political_freedoms:0 "Open Up the Political Sphere"
ARA_more_political_freedoms_desc:0 "We must rejoin the world, now that our internal politics are stable once more."
ARA_deal_with_aftermath:0 "A Shift in Policy"
ARA_deal_with_aftermath_desc:0 "A movement to more harmonic policies must be made; only then will Arantiga begin to deal with the aftermath of the coup."
ARA_the_first_election:0 "The First Election"
ARA_the_first_election_desc:0 "With elections legalised, various parties have formed and are now competing. The only question, who will win?"

ARA_PR_victory_desc:0 "The Riformatore have won the elections."

ARA_welfare_state:0 "Benessere"
ARA_welfare_state_desc:0 "Welfare for everygriff must be instated; nobody should starve because they cannot find work, or are otherwise too unfit to do so. Everygriff has a right to basic necessities, and we will ensure they get them"
ARA_educate_the_poor:0 "Educate the Poor"
ARA_educate_the_poor_desc:0 "Many Griffons in Arantiga are poor and unable to afford education. Rectifying this will increase the number of bright minds in our nation."
ARA_foreign_investors:0 "Foreign Investments"
ARA_foreign_investors_desc:0 "Obtaining foreign investments to build up our nation will help us to boost our economy and create new jobs."
ARA_shakes_claws_with_the_baroness:0 "Seek Legitimacy"
ARA_shakes_claws_with_the_baroness_desc:0 "We must seek the Baroness's approval; With it, even the stubborn Griffons who would rather the Baroness remain in power will have to accept us."
ARA_a_rolemodel:0 "A Proper Rolemodel"
ARA_a_rolemodel_desc:0 "Look at us now, a proper rolemodel for Griffonian Harmony. We are truly the jewel of the South, a beacon of liberty against the staunch depravity of radicals and imperialists around us."
ARA_SDL_victory:0 "The Sosenitori Win!"
ARA_SDL_victory_desc:0 "The Sosenitori have won the elections."
ARA_support_local_industries:0 "Support Local Businesses"
ARA_support_local_industries_desc:0 "Internal growth is required if we are to make any practical growth whatsoever, and funding local entrepreneurs will accomplish just that."
ARA_arantigan_diplomacy:0 "Arantigan Diplomacy"
ARA_arantigan_diplomacy_desc:0 "In this changing world, the importance of diplomatic flexibility cannot be understated. Arantiga must maneuver itself diplomatically, or we will perish, "
ARA_new_police_force:0 "Guardia Pubblica"
ARA_new_police_force_desc:0 "There are still some remnants of Dorotheos' lackeys in our society, alongside Prywhenian agents and the like. Forming a guard against such threats is a good first step to stability."
ARA_arantigan_identity:0 "Reinforce Our Identity"
ARA_arantigan_identity_desc:0 "We are Sparletans. While reclaiming our old legacy is simply madness, we should not forget who we are."

ARA_industrial_development_PCNA:0 "National Industrialisation Effort"
ARA_industrial_development_PCNA_desc:0 "The Nation must see further industrialisation if it is to survive what our enemies could throw at us. More factories, more guns, more industry overall."
ARA_loyal_army:0 "A Loyal Army"
ARA_loyal_army_desc:0 "An army loyal not only to the state but to the state's beliefs as well is the most loyal army of all. As such, we shall 'reeducate' our soldiers and teach them about our cause, in order to make them fanatic warriors, indeed."
ARA_education_reforms_PCNA:0 "Education Reforms"
ARA_education_reforms_PCNA_desc:0 "The many impoverished and sick griffons in our nation have been trampled for far too long. We shall help them back onto their feet by granting them state-funded education, which certainly includes teachings about our socialist methods."
ARA_foreign_intelligence_office:0 "Servizio di Sicurezza Nazionale"
ARA_foreign_intelligence_office_desc:0 "The recently attempted coup has shown that there are traitors within. The newly founded SSN will carefully observe our citizens and ensure that no such attempt at seizing power through open rebellion can ever be made again."
ARA_into_the_world:0 "Into the World"
ARA_into_the_world_desc:0 "Arantiga, under our new leadership, has begun to prosper, once more. Our society advances ever onwards toward the modern age, and we shall not slow down for anyone! Onwards, into the world!"

ARA_support_the_cult_of_megas_arantigos_desc:0 "Arantigos, the Griffon who lead our nation to once lead over half of Griffonia. There is also a widespread belief in Arantiga that Arantigos was the divine incarnation of Boreas, and his mission was to unite all Griffons. Ensuring these beliefs are no longer prosecuted will earn their gratitude and support for our own ends."
ARA_church_universities:0 "Temple Schools"
ARA_church_universities_desc:0 "While some say that religion has little place in education, others do. With religious support from the Cult, we can begin opening new schools and universities for our nation."

### Events ###
arantiga.1.t:0 "The Issue of Arantigan Economic Dependence"
arantiga.1.d:0 "As a small nation in southern Griffonia, Arantiga has never had the best of economies. When the Griffonian Empire collapsed, and Arantiga truly became independent, the situation worsened.\n\nBut not all seemed lost. Arantiga united with the Wingbardians to our south, and joined the Karthinian Pact in hopes of defending against aggressors and rebuilding its economy.\n\nSadly, Wingbardy used their ever growing influence over us to profit from our weakened economy. This has become a massive issue in Arantigan politics, seeing as how Wingbardian entrepreneurs and companies seize a majority of the profits made.\n\nThe question has yet to answered. How will Arantiga continue on? Will we cut ties with the Wingbardians, and strive to become economically independent from them? Or will we try and simply lower their influence, in an attempt to minimise the cons and maximising the pros of their economic 'assistance'?"
arantiga.1.a:0 "Arantiga shall control its own destiny!"
arantiga.1.b:0 "Perhaps we could become equals instead?"

arantiga.2.t:0 "The Ides of March"
arantiga.2.d:0 "Today was the day Dorotheos had been waiting for.\n\nIt was just shortly after 2 in the afternoon, and it seemed as if half of Sparleto was up in arms. Together with his followers, Dorotheos plowed his way through the capital city, all the way to the government district. There, the first shots were exchanged between loyalist police forces and soldiers. As the battle in the streets began to flare up, Dorotheos and his personal guard managed to breach the defenses, and entered the House of Government.\n\nMargareth stood in front of the window in her office, observing the battle. She had already called for reinforcements when she heard the first reports of the possible coup, but for now, their defences would need to hold.\n\nSuddenly, the door to her office was busted open, and as Margareth turned around, she saw her own brother, revolver in his claw, approaching her. She walked backwards, hitting the window behind her. Dorotheos armed his revolver as Margareth closed her eyes, praying to the gods.\n\nJust as he is about to pull the trigger, voices sound from outside the office, getting closer and closer, to the point where they're just around the corner."
arantiga.2.a:0 "It's Dorotheo's men, the coup succeds!"
arantiga.2.b:0 "It's Margareth's reinforcements, Dorotheos is arrested!"

arantiga.3.t:0 "Dorotheos' Trial"
arantiga.3.d:0 "It was a sad moment for Margareth today. To see her own brother, with whom she had grown up and played with since they were both little chicks, on trial for treason. She held back the tears, at least for the moment, but she, and most likely everyone else in the courtroom knew that he was guilty, and that there was no hope in Boreas that he'd come out alive.\n\nThe trial itself did not take long. There were mountains of evidence, including witnesses, the many dead bodies in the streets of Sparleto and, last but not least, Margareth herself, whom he had tried to kill in person before her soldiers overwhelmed and arrested him.\n\nThe judge was cold, but only did his duty as he announced that Dorotheos was guilty as charged. Treason of the highest order. The punishment was none other than death.\n\nAs the guards dragged a grim-looking Dorotheos out of the courtroom, and past Margareth, she couldn't help but finally break out into tears anymore."
arantiga.3.a:0 "May Boreas save him."

arantiga.4.t:0 "A Shift in Policy"
arantiga.4.d:0 "The recently attempted coup has shown us that our current government policies must be corrected in order to appease the public more. We must strive for a democratically elected government, in order to prevent any incidents like these in the future."
arantiga.4.a:0 "Times are changing."

arantiga.5.t:0 "The First Election"
arantiga.5.d:0 "The news of the election rejoiced the nation, and all sorts of movements and parties began to flare up across the country, advertising for their cause and fighting for public support.\n\nShortly before the election was held, there were about 3 possible candidates that could come out as the victor in the upcoming election. The Reformist PR, the currently ruling SDL, or the PCNA.\n\nThe vote has finally been held, and the results are in."
arantiga.5.a:0 "The Partito Riformatore secures a victory!"
arantiga.5.b:0 "The Sosenitori retain leadership!"
arantiga.5.c:0 "The Partito Communista Nazionale wins!"

arantiga.6.t:0 "Shaking Claws"
arantiga.6.d:0 "In an effort to gain her support, Antioco Moro and some other members of government visited the Baroness today, and pleaded for her approval. The Baroness, though pessimistic at first, gave in at last, and gave Moro her sign of approval."
arantiga.6.a:0 "Brilliant!"

arantiga.7.t:0 "The Arantigan Identity"
arantiga.7.d:0 "Arantiga is not the home of radicals, of those who would seek trouble or the destruction of society or peace. Arantiga is home to those who seek to sow peace, only to harvest prosperity. Let us go forth, claw in claw, and heed the Baroness' call, for she will guide us ever steadily into the future."
arantiga.7.a:0 "Lunga vita alla Baronia!"

arantiga.8.t:0 "The Sparletan Rebirth"
arantiga.8.d:0 "The national revival of Dorotheos goes far, further than many had first expected. Today, the ancient Sparletan language was officially revived and introduced as a second official language. While some citizens are annoyed at having to learn a long dead language, many see this as a great cultural revival, and welcome this decision."
arantiga.8.a:0 "Zíto o Sparléos!"

arantiga.9.t:0 "Arantigos Reborn!"
arantiga.9.d:0 "The time has come to reclaim the glory of our homeland! Arantigos, once proud and prosperous, has only been held back by its so called 'allies' in the recent past, and it was once trampled by the vile imperials. No longer, I say! Let us revive our nation's glory, and march on! March on toward the bright light of victory!"
arantiga.9.a:0 "The world shall be mine!"

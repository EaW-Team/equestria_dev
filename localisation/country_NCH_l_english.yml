 NCH_beyond_the_continent_desc:0 "Much as we have come to know the griffons and ponies of the continent, there are rumours of another continent where the true world powers reside. We could mount an expedition to this continent instead."

 NCH_contact_our_kind_desc:0 "Our expedition has revealed something surprising: there are changelings on this other continent! Being closely related, they may be more inclined to assist us than other races. Be warned, however: there's something different about these changelings..."

 NCH_send_a_delegation_to_equestria_desc:0 "Of the countries that we've learned about, Equestria seems to be the best candidate for us to meet with. They are powerful, peaceful and, purportedly, agents of the Harmonic principles. Let us establish relations with them."

 NCH_united_in_race:0 "United in Race"
 NCH_united_in_race_desc:0 "After speaking at length with the hives in the new continent, one thing has become clear; even the supposedly peaceful Equestrians would reject our offers of friendship. Perhaps this Chrysalis character isn't off of her rocker after all..."

 NCH_beacon_of_harmony_desc:0 "We have severely underestimated our capacity to resist the Hives' influence over us. It is only a matter of time that they will try to break us, so let us show them that we won't be cowed!"

 NCH_exchange_of_citizens:0 "Exchange of Citizens"
 NCH_exchange_of_citizens_desc:0 "Despite being bound by race, the Free Hives over the ocean are significantly different from us. Our two people have much to teach one another, and we need only allow them to do so."

 NCH_adapt_the_foreign_way:0 "Adapt the Foreign Way"
 NCH_adapt_the_foreign_way_desc:0 "The Hives under Gold Muffin are alien, but oddly compelling. There is a certain pragmatism to their ways that can explain their success. Perhaps we could adapt them to our society?"

 NCH_scleritian_socialism:0 "Scleritian Socialism"
 NCH_scleritian_socialism_desc:0 "Cader Sclerite has reappeared in the political scene with many proposals. These are considerably less extreme to what he has preached before, and the UCH's influence is clear in his work."

 NCH_a_different_kind_of_changeling_desc:0 "Incidents abroad have led to rumours that balooned into outright discrimination against our people on the continent.

 NCH_trading_with_the_continentals:0 "Trading with the Continentals"
 NCH_trading_with_the_continentals_desc:0 "Now that we have established our place in the continent, it is time for us to build upon it. With this small step, the hope is for all of the continent to become used to our kind. Perhaps, we may even convince the whole world..."

 NCH_equestrian_experts:0 "Equestrian Experts"
 NCH_equestrian_experts_desc:0 "We'll send a request for the Equestrian Principality to send us technical experts, as they have advanced much in their recent history. Being united in Harmony, we can expect them to be excellent teachers."

 NCH_set_up_an_academic_exchange:0 "Set up an Academic Exchange"
 NCH_set_up_an_academic_exchange_desc:0 "We may be benefitting from Equestrian Expertise on a state level, but not on a societal level. Plans have been made to set up a meeting of the academic minds between our two nations in order to correct this."

 NCH_establish_a_diplomatic_corps:0 "Establish a Diplomatic Corps"
 NCH_establish_a_diplomatic_corps_desc:0 "Greneclyf has been isolated for far too long. In order for us to truly enter the world stage we must have the actors for it, and only an official diplomatic corps will produce them."

 NCH_approach_the_federation:0 "Approach the Coalition"
 NCH_approach_the_federation_desc:0 "The River Coalition is the closest major power. Though perhaps not as centralised as a nation like Equestria, we can expect more immediate support from allies in the Riverlands than from those across the ocean."

 ### CRISIS OF FAITH MAIN BRANCH ###

 NCH_crisis_of_faith:0 "Crisis of Faith"

 NCH_a_new_path_desc:0 "It's clear that Gytha's way is no longer viable for the prolonged survival of the Hive. We must now seriously reconsider our traditions and way of life if we are to survive in this uncertain world."

 NCH_scour_the_land_desc:0 "Greneclyf has been our homes for untold generations, but just how well do we know it? An exhaustive survey of our land will be long and not yield immediate results, but it's the first step."

 NCH_digging_deep:0 "Digging Deep"
 NCH_digging_deep_desc:0 "Now that we have some idea of where the more precious resources lie on our island, we must start digging. It'll be a long and ardous project, but it will be worth it."

 NCH_blood_and_sweat:0 "Blood and Sweat"
 NCH_blood_and_sweat_desc:0 "Our initial output has been less than we had originally anticipated. Harsher work regimes and stricter deadlines may be cruel, but they are ultimately necessary."

 NCH_establish_a_schooling_system_desc:0 "With the mass illiteracy dealt with, we can now work with sages and elders to agree upon a standardised education system. With so many differing opinions, this will prove difficult to achieve."

 NCH_literacy_volunteer_brigades:0 "Literacy Volunteer Brigades"
 NCH_literacy_volunteer_brigades_desc:0 "The changelings of Greneclyf have long been illiterate, to the point that it has directly hampered our societal development. Recruiting literate volunteers to teach others will be the best way to overcome this challenge."

 NCH_found_the_elder_academy:0 "Found the Royal Academy"
 NCH_found_the_elder_academy_desc:0 "With a proper schooling system in place, Greneclyf is now poised to build its first institution dedicated to higher learning. It may not be as prestigious as those abroad, but it shall serve our purposes just as well."

 NCH_support_local_artisans:0 "Support Local Artisans"
 NCH_support_local_artisans_desc:0 "Having no proper industry of our own, only the artisans are capable of producing anything. With proper support, they can form guilds and other such similar institutions, bringing together many workers to the fold."

 NCH_promote_corporate_entities:0 "Promote Corporate Entities"
 NCH_promote_corporate_entities_desc:0 "The next step in the industrial evolution, we must assist the artisan guilds into forming proper corporations. There will be much resistance from the very artisans that we're fighting to enfranchise, so this will be an ardous endeavour."

 NCH_inaugurate_the_industrial_district_desc:0 "It has been a long time coming, but we now can finally inaugurate the first district truly dedicated to the heavy industries in Blomsport!

 NCH_splendid_isolation:0 "Daingean Grena"
 NCH_splendid_isolation_desc:0 "We have done what was necessary to adapt to the world around us, but it's clear that the outside world still fears us. Though things may change eventually, we shall stay put."

 ### CRISIS OF FAITH FASCISM ###

 NCH_the_old_ways:0 "The Old Ways"
 NCH_the_old_ways_desc:0 "We were foolish to believe that we could convince the outside world that we could be peaceful. Even our Queen recognizes the folly of her ways, and has agreed that changelings will only be seen as duplicitous parasites."

 NCH_infiltrating_the_continent:0 "Infiltrating the Continent"
 NCH_infiltrating_the_continent_desc:0 "We are woefully ignorant of the current situation on the continent. Adopting our ancient techniques will allow us to send agents to relay news from the interior back to us."

 NCH_infiltrating_the_military:0 "Infiltrating the Military"
 NCH_infiltrating_the_military_desc:0 "Preliminary reports indicate that the world's militaries have advanced significantly. If we are to survive, we must learn from our rivals by placing agents in key position in numerous general staffs."

 NCH_take_the_initiative:0 "Take the Initiative"
 NCH_take_the_initiative_desc:0 "Our rivals are too preoccupied with infighting and from external attacks. This is the perfect opportunity for us to make our presence felt by the world. They wanted monsters? Well, now they've got monsters!"

 NCH_infiltrating_the_industries:0 "Infiltrating the Industries"
 NCH_infiltrating_the_industries_desc:0 "Where we have remained mostly agrarian, the world has developed machinery and heavy industry to radically improve production. It is clear that we must observe from the better industrialised countries to see what we can learn."

 NCH_infiltrating_the_academia:0 "Infiltrating the Academia"
 NCH_infiltrating_the_academia_desc:0 "Greneclyf is stuck in the medieval age, whereas everyone else has modernised. Infiltrating the more prestigious universities and academies is the clear first step in catching up with our rivals."

 NCH_operation_farseer:0 "Operation Farseer"
 NCH_operation_farseer_desc:0 "With many of our infiltrators in commanding positions, they can abduct, steal, and threaten the world's greatest minds to assist in our cause."

 NCH_passive_approach:0 "Passive Approach"
 NCH_passive_approach_desc:0 "Despite our efforts, it is clear that Greneclyf will never be in a position to directly challenge any of our enemies. As such, it is perhaps wiser for us to bide our time for a more opportune time and to adopt a defensive posture."

 NCH_plan_white:0 "The Farbrook Question"
 NCH_plan_white_desc:0 "The ponies of Farbrook have been our ancient friends, but there have been doubts among our own people regarding the Farbrookians' true feelings. Before we decide what must be done about Farbrook, we must better understand where they stand."

 NCH_Coup_FBK_Fascist:0 "Gearr na Crainn Arda"
 NCH_Coup_FBK_Fascist_desc:0 "It has been decided: we must cut the tall trees. Soon afterwards, Farbrook shall fall under our influence!"

 NCH_Ally_With_Fascist_FBK:0 "Offer an Alliance"
 NCH_Ally_With_Fascist_FBK_desc:0 "With Farbrook having similar goals to our own, it might be best to rekindle our friendship for a new purpose. Who knows? Perhaps with them on our side, our military ventures will prove to be far easier."

 NCH_oversee_farbrook:0 "Oversee Farbrook"
 NCH_oversee_farbrook_desc:0 "Even though the rightful government has taken power, Farbrook is in shambles. We will step in and take over in our ally's name."

 NCH_look_beyond:0 "Look Beyond"
 NCH_look_beyond_desc:0 "In spite of our previous successes, we are still surrounded by potential enemies. From now on, Greneclyf must always have to keep a careful eye beyond our borders and plan accordingly."

 ### CRISIS OF FAITH COMMUNIST BRANCH ###

 NCH_invite_cader_sclerite:0 "Invite Cader Sclerite"
 NCH_invite_cader_sclerite_desc:0 "Cader Sclerite has long been a proponent of a foreign philosophy from abroad. In the past he had been sidelined Queen Gytha's more popular ideals, but now the idea of worker equality might just be what we need."

 NCH_find_a_compromise:0 "Find a Compromise"
 NCH_find_a_compromise_desc:0 "Sclerite is willing to do his part to better Greneclyf, but he has no interest in taking charge. [Root.GetLeader] will remain in power, though Sclerite will be by her side from now on."

 NCH_remove_the_queen:0 "Remove the Queen"
 NCH_remove_the_queen_desc:0 "We'd rather be damned than allow for another disaster brought upon us by the Clanns. Despite what he otherwise says, Sclerite is our best chance to get out of this mess."

 NCH_collectivisation:0 "Grand Collectivisation"
 NCH_collectivisation_desc:0 "With the Queen gone, Sclerite is free to apply his policies to their full extent. Forcibly uniting private farms and guilds may seem cruel, but it is a necessary step to rapidly increase production."

 NCH_unionisation:0 "Unionisation"
 NCH_unionisation_desc:0 "Long discussions between [Root.GetLeader] and Sclerite have yielded results. Sclerite's more extreme policies have been tempered to allow some worker rights and the existence of semi-private companies. "

 NCH_centralisation:0 "Centralisation"
 NCH_centralisation_desc:0 "Greneclyf has been a series of small hives under one Queen since time immemorial. This inefficiency must be addressed with a swift centralisation of power under one group rather than several."

 NCH_the_four_year_plan_desc:0 "Now that our workers are united and power is centered around the government, Sclerite has unveiled a number of economic and industrial goals to be achieved over the course of three years. This will call for brutal efficiency and modernisation, and plenty of sweat and tears from our people."

 NCH_acquire_srfn_experts:0 "Acquire SRFG Experts"
 NCH_acquire_srfn_experts_desc:0 "The Socialist Republic of the Free Griffons, the same nation from which Sclerite had adopted his ideology, is host to many left-leaning experts. We must procure these experts, by any means necessary."

 NCH_establish_the_cis:0 "Establish the CIS"
 NCH_establish_the_cis_desc:0 "Our efforts of modernisation and industrialisation will undoubtedly draw out many dissenters from within and enemies from abroad. A new governmental organ, the Comissariat of Internal Security, will protect us from all political threats."

 NCH_a_red_curriculum:0 "A Red Curriculum"

 NCH_form_an_intelligence_network:0 "Form an Intelligence Network"
 NCH_form_an_intelligence_network_desc:0 "Preliminary analyses by the CIS indicate that while our defenses are stout, we lack any meaningful offensive capacity. The CIS can apply external pressure abroad if we give them the resources to do so."

 NCH_a_red_academy:0 "A Red Academy"

 NCH_formalize_a_general_staff:0 "Form a General Staff"
 NCH_formalize_a_general_staff_desc:0 "Our isolation and traditions have limited our military progress, and it is evident in our lack of a dedicated officer staff. Going off from what we've observed, we can correct this deficiency."

 NCH_perpetual_revolution:0 "Spreading the Revolution"
 NCH_perpetual_revolution_desc:0 "We have seen the outside world. There are too many enemies to the our way of life, even among those who fancy themselves as communists. We can only safeguard ourselves by taking the initiative."

 NCH_the_modern_changeling:0 "The Modern Changeling"
 NCH_the_modern_changeling_desc:0 "We can see how far we've come as a people in the last years, and we've become something different. We are neither antagonistic nor amicable: we are the modern pragmatists. We are the Modern Changelings."

 NCH_peaceful_infiltration:0 "Peaceful Infiltration"
 NCH_peaceful_infiltration_desc:0 "We have ancient ties to Farbrook, and although we must ensure their political loyalty, we can do so while sparing them from unnecessary bloodshed."

 NCH_a_more_direct_approach:0 "A More Direct Approach"
 NCH_a_more_direct_approach_desc:0 "History must not be an obstacle to progress, and Farbrook is no exception. Old friends will die, but it is for the greater good."

 NCH_infiltrate_the_federation:0 "Infiltrate the Coalition"
 NCH_infiltrate_the_federation_desc:0 "The River Coalition is a behemoth, and there will be no chance for us to directly exert our influence upon them. Instead, a more subtle approach will be necessary to take the Coalition down."

 ### MILITARY BRANCH ###

 NCH_reorganize_the_army:0 "Reorganising the Army"
 NCH_reorganize_the_army_desc:0 "For time immemorial, there has been no 'standing army' in Greneclyf. The closest thing to it has been the Household Guard. Being the only professional soldiers, the drones-at-arms typically levied by the many Clanns simply do not compare. We must take immediate steps to reform our military thinking and our methods."

 NCH_form_a_dedicated_officer_corps:0 "Form a Dedicated Officer Corps"
 NCH_form_a_dedicated_officer_corps_desc:0 "Traditionally, military officers are exclusively Royals who have shown an affinity towards the command of units and soldiers. While this may ensure a pool of competent leaders, its size is limited by the number of possible candidates. Offering a military education as well as allowing the enrollment of Drones will expand that pool, and form a standard to which all future commanders will adhere to."

 NCH_the_industrial_question:0 "The Logistics Question"
 NCH_the_industrial_question_desc:0 "Modern land warfare requires an infrastructure of logistics on a scale previously unseen in Greneclyf, and it necessitates dedicated batallions solely responsible for maintaining lines of communication and supplies to keep our forces fighting for longer. As such, steps must be taken for to form such batallions, as well as the industrial capacity to supply the necessary supplies."

 NCH_purchase_production_licenses:0 "Purchase Production Licenses"
 NCH_purchase_production_licenses_desc:0 "Greneclyf has little experience with the use modern weapons, even less so with the production of them and their munitions. No matter what we do, any native designs will simply not compare to those of foreign designs. While we set aside the necessary funds to set up the necessary industries, we must search for weapon and equipment deals abroad."

 NCH_domestic_arms_factories:0 "Domestic Arms Factories"
 NCH_domestic_arms_factories_desc:0 "Our people have been fairly self-sufficient, so why should our weapons and military equipment industries be any different? Everything that we use should be of Greneclyfian origin. As we are searching for new designs domestically, Greneclyf must immediately begin a massive construction programme to be the foundation of our industries."

 NCH_limited_expansion:0 "Limited Expansion"
 NCH_limited_expansion_desc:0 "We mustn't upset the current environment with the expansion of our current guilds and workshops. Our crafters and metalworkers must be allowed to adapt to the new requirements and tools, lest we bring about unrest among the guilds."

 NCH_give_more_funds:0 "Offer More Funds"
 NCH_give_more_funds_desc:0 "Greneclyf must do everything to catapult our idustries forwards, no matter how sudden it may appear to our workers. To placate any qualms that they may have, we'll appropriate the necessary funds and capital."

 NCH_modern_firearms:0 "Reichswaffen Rifles"
 NCH_modern_firearms_desc:0 "The Reichswaffen Company in the Griffon Empire has made massive waves in the armaments industry, of which even we have felt. Our experts have experimented with their rifles, and have deemed them to be the best from the continent. Let us send a formal offer to their company to establish a cooperative enterprise on our isle."

 NCH_modern_artillery:0 "Greda Guns"
 NCH_modern_artillery_desc:0 "Wingbardy's heavy weapons have long been renowned for their efficacy, and many have called their artillery the most fearsome on the continent. Greda is an old cannon designer, and they may be willing to share their designs with us if we make a good enough offer."

 NCH_automotives:0 "Freemare Automotives"
 NCH_automotives_desc:0 "The pony enclave of New Mareland to the south-west has inherited a strong automotive tradition from Equestria, and it is home to the Freemare Automotive company. Following an economic depression, they may be looking for new business opportunities; let us offer them one that they can't refuse."

 NCH_armoured_vehicles:0 "KLAA Prototypes"
 NCH_armoured_vehicles_desc:0 "The Changeling Lands are at the cutting edge of armour development, and it would be remiss of us to not approach one of their famed designer companies for some of their armoured behemoths. Perhaps they may even be willing to set up a mutual company on Greneclyf dedicated to the develompent of tanks."
 
 NCH_inf_weapons:0 "Lochainn Loadaid"
 NCH_inf_weapons_desc:0 "Our smithies are renowned for their steel weapons, and are thus the best candidate to expand their expertise into firearms. They shall be aggregated into the Lochainn Loadaid na nGaibhaire, and offered the tools and funds to begin work on our homegrown firearms."
 
 NCH_heavy_weapons:0 "Airtléire na nGreneclyf"
 NCH_heavy_weapons_desc:0 "Perhaps less radical of an idea than a hoof-held firearm, bombards and cannons have nevertheless not been part of Greneclyfian combined arms. We must set up the appropriate smithies and ironworks to be placed under a single entity solely dedicated to the production of these mighty weapons. Only then will artillery become a permament fixture of the Greneclyfian army."
 
 NCH_automotive_industry:0 "Biúró na nGluaisteán"
 NCH_automotive_industry_desc:0 "Machines and the production of their parts is a wholly new field of manufacturing that must be built from the ground up if we are ever to compete with the equivalent industries of other nations. Difficult as it is, we ought to focus on motorising our society, rather than producing machines solely dedicated for war."
 
 NCH_tank_investments:0 "The Greneclyfian Tanc"
 NCH_tank_investments_desc:0 "Automotives have their place in war, but armoured fighting vehicles have shown to be decisive tools in war and force multipliers. The 'tanc' should be prioritised, lest we be left at a grievous disadvantage when battling superiour forces."
 
 NCH_continue_the_purchases:0 "Extend the Lincenses"
 NCH_continue_the_purchases_desc:0 "Our production licenses have proven to be a success, and there is little reason to not build upon them. Following the foreign designs may prove difficult to replicate, but will be on par with those of any potential foe."

 NCH_end_the_deals:0 "Terminate the Licenses"
 NCH_end_the_deals_desc:0 "We have learned what we could from the strangers, so we should consider adapting what we've purchased to suit our industrial capacity. More modern designs will come by more slowly without direct support from the foreign experts, but it is time for us to start producing purely native designs."

 NCH_tighten_conscription_regulations:0 "Tighten Conscription Regulations"
 NCH_tighten_conscription_regulations_desc:0 "There is a reason why only the best were recruited into the Household Guard of old, and while we may loosen some of the more stringent requirements for enrollment into the Guard itself, we should still be looking for the best to form our file and rank."

But in this modern age of warfare exist flying machines that can be equipped with fully automatic weapons—far larger than anything a single drone could carry, much less fly with.

After a lavish ceremony, all eyes were upon the departing vessels as they left port waters.\n\nWe can expect some of them to return within a few weeks, whereas the others will take far longer to bring back a response.

 greneclyf.2.d:0 "A ship from Greneclyf have arrived at Farbrook, filled to the brim with changelings. This in it of itself was strange, as traffic from the isle is usually no more than a few fishing vessels, but the fact that many political and governmental representatives were onboard was telling. Port authorities were immediately approached by these Greneclyfians, requesting an immediate audience with [Root.GetLeader].\n\nThe head delegate, speaking in Queen Gytha's name, has informed us of a shift in Greneclyf's policy. Their ship is one of many that are headed to various other nations in the continent, seeking a relation similar to our own. They've come to us proposing a number of amendments to the Great Pacts. The specifics are many, but the they mostly encompass an expansion on existing terms, namely a formalisation on the movement of our citizens between our nations. While some of the long-term objectives are somewhat ambitious, the short-term goal to enrichen our currently stale trade is a very realistic one.\n\nThe Greneclyfian diplomat stands before you, waiting for your response."
 greneclyf.2.a:0 "We shall honour our friends' wishes."
 greneclyf.2.b:0 "Now is not the most opportune time."

 greneclyf.7.t:0 "Farbrook Breaks off Relations"
 greneclyf.7.d:0 "We have finally gotten word back from Farbrook, but a stunned diplomat has returned to tell us of an utter cessation of all ties, official or otherwise, between our nations. The news have spread quickly, and a general sense of sorrow has gripped the hearts of many of our people, as many have friends over in Farbrook.\n\nThe Queen has done her best to calm down the populace, but despite her insistence otherwise, she too has suffered from the loss of her own relationship."

 greneclyf.8.t:0 "Love Leeches Wish to Trade"
 greneclyf.8.d:0 "Changelings, ancient monsters capable of shapeshifting and sucking their victims dry emotionally, arrived upon our shores with the offer to trade. Hailing from the island of Greneclyf, these insectoid ponies have come with urgent request to open up trade routes as part of a national effort to promote Harmonic elements in their society. On the one hoof, they're changelings who shouldn't be trusted, as per the old mares' tales. On the other hoof, they are still tales. Perhaps we should give these bugs a shot and show us how Harmonic they really are."
 greneclyf.8.a:0 "If these changelings are truly Harmonic, we will soon find out."

 greneclyf.9.t:0 "Bakara Agrees"
 greneclyf.9.d:0 "Our envoy to Bakara returned home today with news of acceptance.

 greneclyf.9.a:0 "Good, but... is that normal for them?"

 greneclyf.10.t:0 "Bakara Refuses"
 greneclyf.10.d:0 "Our envoy to Bakara returned home today to give the unfortunate news of rejection. Despite our earnest attempts to sway them, the leadership there simply would not be convinced that we changelings are capable of a Harmonic lifestyle!

 greneclyf.11.d:0 "Some sudden news came today in the form of ships hoisting a flag of unknown origin landing in port under the guise of peace. Aboard these weaponless convoys were insectoid creatures called changelings. Previously all was known about them came from old foal's tales of they being emotion leeching parasites, though the real life counterparts appear docile, small, and weak. They came offering iron and steel along with their own brand of textile products in exchange for our own goods. They seem harmless enough..."
 greneclyf.11.a:0 "They're completely harmless, and Nimbusia could always have more friends than enemies."
 greneclyf.11.b:0 "They're pitiful and weak. They can buy their safety with their ship."

 greneclyf.14.d:0 "Coming in through the riverways, a group of strange, bug-like ponies called changelings from beyond the coast have arrived to formalise new trading relations between our two people. This would involve an exchange of merchants and goods.\n\nWe have of course heard about their kind before, and while these particular changelings come bearing gifts, might perhaps be all a ruse. Maybe they've managed to fool the other member states that they were friendly, or perhaps these Greneclyfians truly wish to just be friends.\n\nHow should we respond?"
 greneclyf.14.a:0 "They've come a long way, it's only right to accept."

 greneclyf.19.t:0 "Jezeragrad Refuses"

Despite all of the myths about these creatures as sinister emotion leeches that shapeshift to infiltrate our lives, these supposed creatures approached in their apparently original form. They came with the request for open trade in regard to our gems and other rare mineral stores in exchange for exotic fish, some iron and steel products, along with their own brand of textiles work. Despite how the myths painted these 'bugs', they're rather tiny and unassuming."

We don't necessarily have much to offer outside wheat (which might not even be what these bugs eat) however, they come offering iron, steel, and textile products! This is a good exchange, but then again, they are complete outsiders..."

While these stories are actually true about them...the ones who've come today have done so in peace. In fact they've shown the utmost respect and have come in their origin form as well. No reports of trouble or other misdeeds either after their arrival...perhaps they're genuine enough. \n\nRegardless the bugs have come with the desire to open up trade routes between Wittenburgh and "Greneclyf", their island home. Aside from generic products such as iron, steel, and textiles...the bugs, these 'changelings' have made the interesting offer to exchange magical knowledge. Apparently the lore of changelings is vastly unknown as...we have no records on it. Perhaps this is a gold mine that has fallen right onto our lap? Then again...we know for sure the true nature of these creatures is naturally malicious. This could easily be nothing more than a show they're putting up to infiltrate our ranks..."

Many of our trading deals are failing, either by staunch refusal to our offers or by cessation of those accepted by the other parties. These have severely demoralised our people, but none more so than Queen Gytha. Upon hearing word of the latest failure, she lost herself in open despair, affecting a few too close to her. After much struggle, the Queen managed to sober up enough to close herself off in her personal chamber.\n\nShut off from everyone, the Queen has left no one on the seat of power, and no one is sure as to what can be done.

After several days of intense dialogue and discussion, an urgent matter has to be resolved today, namely what must be done with the Queen.\n\nFor past week Queen Gytha has been absent from nearly all affairs of statehood, after having locked herself in her private chambers, and is refusing to see anyone; not even her closest friends and advisors can reach to the Queen. With no one at the throne, Greneclyf risks collapse if it continues to remain empty. The Queen's House does not have a suitable replacement, and thus the Council's is considering to invoke a vote. Of the many candidates, Princess Oiren of House Aurelia is the prominent and plausible alternative.\n\nBeing the eldest Royal out of all of the suitable candidates —second only to the Queen— Oiren is a far more reserved Royal compared to Gytha, and has championed a more isolationist policy. This would fly in the face of a tradition that has been followed for centuries, and there are a few in the Council openly questioning Oiren's motives. She has insisted that her priorities are for Greneclyf first and foremost, and that her actions are not motivated by her House's ancient rivalry with House Lepidoptera, the Queen's House. Were the Council to invoke the vote, Oiren is certain to win, as all of the other viable candidates pale in comparison to her experience and popularity.\n\nSome of the Council are still hoping for Queen Gytha to recover from whatever is afflicting her, and that she will soon return to bring back at least some semblance of order. House Lepidotpera has ruled continually for centuries, and both its regents and their philosophies have brought us peace and stability. Perhaps the best course for Greneclyf is to wait for the Queen to come back to us."

Where do we officially stand on this matter?"
 greneclyf_crisis.2.d_DMT:0 "Grave news from Dit-Kazaar on the continent: a Greneclyfian citizen is currently incarcerated awaiting trial for murder.\n\nWhat exactly has happened is unclear, but the local authorities claim that the suspect was found loitering near a murder scene. When prodded for further evidence implicating him, we were given a prompt reply of 'he looks like he did it.'\n\nNeedless to say, our citizen insists that he happened to have been wandering nearby when the police had discovered the body of the victim, though so far his pleads of innocence have fallen upon deaf ears. None of the local residents have spoken up in his defense, and most are convinced of his guilt despite the lack of hard evidence.

The incident has caused a stir amongst the ponies, who were already going against their usual xenophobia by letting Greneclyfan merchants trade in their country. Now even most of the pro-harmony reformists have lost confidence in our species.\n\nBoth the changeling and the victim were allegedly travelling towards some sort of sacred city for the Nimbusians by the name of Prancetras. Friends of our subject say that he got curious after hearing stories of an oracle who lives there, however, shortly before the changeling reached the city, he encountered the victim, a pegasus citizen. Whatever transpired there ended with a dead pegasus and our subject assuming the identity of the pony he just killed. Of course he was found out soon afterwards and was arrested by the Nimbusian authorities.\n\nThe changeling has sworn that it was in fact the pegasus who attacked him, but testimonies by the victim’s family and friends say the victim was an honourable citizen and a veteran too, making the Nimbusians skeptical towards his testimony. This case is turning into a nightmare for Nimbusian-Greneclyfian relations. Do we believe our citizen’s story or do we back the Nimbusian authorities to save face?"

Through the storm, two monks also traversed the same path as the changeling. When the monks walked past the cave, they saw the changeling’s glowing eyes staring at them. A few seconds later, our citizen was overwhelmed and dragged out of the cave and the monks were shouting at him in an unknown language.\n\nIt turns out our subject ventured into a cave where an evil ‘demon’ was supposedly sealed away. Entering this cave is a grievous offence and extremely suspicious to the pious Pònaidheans. The Taoiseach of Pònaidhean has asked us for our opinion, stating that she is willing to believe this was a misunderstanding, but that letting the changeling go now may mean that the clans in her country vote for restrictions on trade with Greneclyf in the future..."

As he was being judged, orators in major cities repeated the story of the alleged crime, embellishing and adding further heinous acts with each retelling. By the time he was released, none of the Bakarans could believe that the monster that they had continously heard about was set free, and was chased away from the scene.\n\nNeedless to say, we have already sent our official protests to the Bakaran government, though our diplomats there expect little sympathy from it."

Apparently, the defendant fled from his confinement and has not been seen since the previous night.\n\nOur diplomat of course refuted any part in the defendant's escape and offered a stern condemnation of their actions, but in private, he has expressed relief over the matter. The few times that the accused had been seen by his fellow Greneclyfians, it was in a dungeoun under horrendous conditions. What little food was given was woefully inadequate, and the last time a close friend saw him, the jailed changeling was severely emanciated. It is little wonder that he has escaped his confinement in light of the circumstances.\n\nDespite our official condemnation of the defendant's escape, many diamond dogs were left convinced that there was no way that he had managed to do so unaided, and are now eyeing other Greneclyfians with suspicion."

The trials in the country were quite populist affairs, however, and our subject was already disadvantaged by being both a foreigner and a changeling. Still, the pegasus attorney delivered a flaming speech arguing that there was absolutely no evidence for the murder, pointing out that his client was unarmed and a weapon was found on the body of the dead pegasus. The lawyer of the victim countered by a gross depiction of stereotypes. The attorney played the crowd and fed their fears of the unknown. Despite no evidence that the changeling was actually guilty, the jury of citizens deemed the evidence substantive enough, referring to our subject as the "insectoid monster."\n\nThe trial continued to the second phase, where both the accused and the accuser got to propose a punishment. The defense attorney, under pressure and cornered by the mood of the crowd, decided to push for banishment, while the attacker pleaded for the death penalty. Thanks to the excellent oration of our lawyer, our citizen narrowly escaped death, with the attorney convincing just enough ponies to let the changeling leave, without his possessions, of course. Although our subject escaped Nimbusia with his life, opinions towards changelings in Nimbusia are turner ever sourer."

With the law system separated by Pònaidhean tribe, the Taoiseach had no choice but to make the changeling a temporary honourary member of her own clan. With that, the framework of laws was set.\n\nOur subject was helpless against the clan elders and the monks who acted as witnesses. Most of the court proceedings happened in a language our citizen couldn’t even understand and nopony offered him legal counsel. The crimes of the changeling were extremely exaggerated by the elders in the end, as they seemed to truly believe that if the monks hadn’t stopped him, the accused would have unleashed a terrible spirit. So, they gave the changeling a sentence of being taken in at a monastery for three years or until he came to repent his demonic past, whichever came later. Without any proper way of defending himself, our subject was dragged off to some forgotten mountaintop, forced into the Pònaidheans’ weird religious institutions."

There are already scattered reports of hate crime related atrocities being committed against the Greneclyfians, although these are, thankfully, relatively few and far between as yet.\n\nThere has been no official response from the island nation as of yet, but it will almost certainly be unfavourable."
 greneclyf_crisis.4.a:0 "Our citizens' well-being matters more than the feelings of some bugs'."
 
 greneclyf_crisis.5.t:0 "Rumours Spread about our People"
 greneclyf_crisis.5.d:0 "The trial of one of our own has been noticed throughout the Riverlands. More and more reports are coming in of incidents of flat-out racism against our kind, and more Riverland companies refused cooperation with Greneclyf for reasons we suspect to be because of our race. Our citizens are looking to us for instructions. Some even openly ask if they should give up on friendship with the Riverlands entirely.\n\nFour options are available to us and careful consideration must be made for the safety of our people and our relations with the continentals. We could tell our people to be on guard, although this may make Greneclyfians seem suspicious. We could ask them to be friendlier and patient with those giving them a hard time, to show them our good side. We could also advise our people to consider returning home if they feel threatened, but this may be seen as giving up. Lastly, we could refuse to change course at all."

 greneclyf_crisis.6.t:0 "Greneclyfian Goods Boycotted"
 greneclyf_crisis.6.d:0 "Previously, some of our merchants in the continent had claimed that the Riverlanders were deliberately avoiding to do business with them due to suspected racism. It was a side effect back then, but now people are actively refusing to purchase in our stores abroad. Many of our people have also been refused service in local shops, lending further credence that this is a concentrated effort.\n\nAs a result, our people are reporting losses that will eventually push them out of the markets on the continent. Many of our merchants have called for retaliatory boycotts back at home, even though by all accounts foreign traders have been keeping perfectly fair and legal activities in Greneclyf. Some have suggested to show good will on our part by subsidising our people's purchases of local goods in the continent, whereas others advise to simply help our traders there to recoup their losses.\n\nWhat should we tell our people?"
 greneclyf_crisis.6.a:0 "Help our people to purchase the goods of the locals."
 greneclyf_crisis.6.b:0 "Cover the losses that our merchants are suffering."
 greneclyf_crisis.6.c:0 "Impose boycotts against foreign businesses in Blomsport."
 greneclyf_crisis.6.e:0 "...maybe our merchants are doing poorly because they're no good?"

 greneclyf_crisis.7.t:0 "Violent Clashes"
 greneclyf_crisis.7.d:0 "While overall disdain held towards our people has dissipated, there are groups of continentals in certain parts of the Riverlands that actively seek out our people to harrass. These roving bands of thugs have prompted some of our citizens to ignore our previous instructions and actively engage them with their own ad-hoc groups. Fortunately these confrontations haven't caused any deaths, but there has been at least one critical injury so far.\n\nOur representatives have been drowning in protests from the respective governments regarding the behaviour of our changelings, promising dire consequences if the matter isn't addressed promptly and in a satisfactory manner. Our diplomats are looking to us for a formal response."
 greneclyf_crisis.7.a:0 "Their people started it! They share the brunt of the blame!"
 greneclyf_crisis.7.b:0 "Both sides are equally at fault. We'll chastise our own if they chastise theirs."

 greneclyf_crisis.8.t:0 "Greneclyfians Forced to Abandon the Continent"
 greneclyf_crisis.8.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, the continentals couldn't shake free of their preconceived perceptions of us, and have let their fears lash out at our people. They've endured for many weeks, but there has been no end in sight to the prejudice suffered at the hooves of our people. Ships laden with changelings have returned to Greneclyf seeking respite from the terrible treatment abroad. Unfortunately, these same changelings took out their anger at the continentals who willingly came here.\n\nThe recently inaugurated merchant district in Blomsport was mobbed by the returning merchants and adventurers, actively attacking ponies who were only guilty by association. There were no reported deaths from the clashes, but many were injured, some severely, and the entire district was utterly devastated by ransacking and looting.\n\nOnce the news returned on the continent, we were issued an ultimatum by the entire Coalition: leave their lands and never return.\n\nWith no other choice, we had to acquiesce to their demands and end our official relations with a sour note. People in Greneclyf are now seriously questioning the entire endeavour that [Root.GetLeader] had launched into the continent, as well what must be done in order to move forward in the world.\n\nAre we truly without merit in the eyes of the foreigners?"
 greneclyf_crisis.8.a:0 "But... but I did the right thing... didn't I?"

 greneclyf_crisis.9.t:0 "Tensions Fade in the Riverlands"
 greneclyf_crisis.9.d:0 "After punishing the Greneclyfians responsible for inciting violence, there has been a tense if calm period within our communities in the continent. Many of the violent locals have either been arrested by the authorities or have been shamed into submission by the majority of Riverlanders. It appears that we have finally defeated the caricature that had been placed upon us, and have earned if not amiable admiration, at least a grudging respect of our level-headed approach to the troubles that our people have had.\n\nMany natives have admitted shame of their past actions and have asked for forgiveness for their folly and blind fear that they once held. As expected, almost every Greneclyfian has wholeheartedly accepted their apologies and have, in true Greneclyfian spirit, extended a hoof of friendship to those who had wronged them before. While most of our communities are still fairly separated from those of local residents, there are some that are integrating very quickly and very well.\n\nBusiness has returned to normal, and there is nary a sign of trouble ahead for our people. Greneclyfians have finally stepped into the wider world, and we have not been shunned for it."
 greneclyf_crisis.9.a:0 "Harmony among all beings is possible after all."

 greneclyf..t:0 "A Revival of the Old Ways"
 greneclyf..d:0 "Much time has passed with the Queen absent from the affairs of state. While the Council debates what to do, something dark has been taking root in Gytha's mind...\n\nHarmony was supposed to be the path, as it had been for centuries, but it has led us astray. The world refuses to help Greneclyf solely because of their primal fear of changelings. How can a changeling befriend someone who fears them? How can a changeling love someone who hates them? How can Gytha trust Cenhelm if he refuses to help her?\n\nWell, something from deep within the Queen has taken over, and it is ancient.\n\nA new hunger permeates the air wherever Gytha is present, and while she appears to have recovered from her break, there is something hidden behind her fanged smiles and glowing eyes. This is a changeling Royal reborn, and one who has a sole purpose now: protect and feed her Hive, no matter the cost.\n\nDark clouds are gathering on the isle, and they threaten to billow forth unto the continent."
 greneclyf..a:0 "If it's monsters they want..."

 greneclyf..t:0 "Together Once More"
 greneclyf..d:0 "We have seen the other continent, and while there are many things that are disconcerting about Queen Chrysalis and her subjects, it is ultimately irrelevant — we are bound by biology.\n\nQueen Gytha and Chrysalis have spent much time in private discussing at great lengths as to how their respective nations can work better together moving forwards. At first, those closest to Gytha told of her adamantly frustrated by their ideological differences. Something has changed recently, however; the Greneclyfian Royal is no longer as approachable as she had been, and many wonder what could have brought about this change.\n\nRegardless, this shift has coincided with a breakthrough in the Royals' private negotiations. Greneclyf will serve as a faithful ally to our kin from across the sea, bound by the blood of our kind. Some still wonder if this new Queen Gytha will be prepared for this challenge, however..."
 greneclyf..a:0 "§GQueen Chrysalis was very convincing.§!"

 greneclyf..t:0 "A Frank Talk Between Queens"
 greneclyf..d:0 "Many trembled in fear when they saw their queen's furious response to Chrysalis's challenge. While her erstwhile intent was to arrest Chrysalis, Queen Gytha instead decided to try to finally stamp out Chrysalis's ideals. Long hours passed after that first confrontation, leaving many waiting with bated breath for the outcome. Surprisingly enough, a seemingly humbled Chrysalis accompanied Gytha to be shown the errors of her ways.\n\n"No more lying, no more scheming," said the Queen. "Chrysalis's goals are united with Our own."\n\nSo with the two Royals finally in agreement, Greneclyf appears prepared to finally tackle the question of how to proceed in light of the great nations refusing our offers of peace and love. One thing is for certain though: Chrysalis shall work with Gytha as a close advisor."
 greneclyf..a:0 "I knew that she'd come around."

 smugbugfug_desc:0 "§gGarran of Clann Leamhan is a fairly young changeling  general from the Blomsport Academy, member of the new generation of officers and thrust in this position thanks to his noble lineage. Passionate about the multitude of intelligent species that inhabit this world, Garran spend most of his free time studying and interacting with them, wishing to know everything about their biological and psychological functioning and sincerely appreciating their presence.\n\nOf a talkative nature and benefitting from the education of a noble family, his fondness for the other species makes Garran a pleasant and tolerant companion. However, due to his military career he does not hesitate to use his knowledge on the battlefield to infiltrate, deceive and manipulate his enemies to his advantage, cruelly manipulating their minds as much as possible and encouraging his staff to do the same. Despite his kind nature during  peace time, some may accuse him to be a twisted mind trickster.§!"

 NCH_beyond_the_continent:0 "Beyond the Continent?"
 NCH_beyond_the_continent_desc:0 "Much as we have come to know the griffons and ponies of the continent, there are rumours of another continent where the true world powers reside. We could mount an expedition to this continent instead."

 NCH_search_elsewhere:0 "Search Elsewhere"
 NCH_search_elsewhere_desc:0 "From what little we know, there is something brewing beyond the lands that we've kept in contact with. Perhaps it might be best to start our search there."

 NCH_contact_our_kind_desc:0 "Our expedition has revealed something surprising: there are changelings on this other continent! Being closely related, they may be more inclined to assist us than other races. Be warned, however: there's something different about these changelings..."

 NCH_send_a_delegation_to_equestria_desc:0 "Of the countries that we've learned about, Equestria seems to be the best candidate for us to meet with. They are powerful, peaceful and, purportedly, agents of the Harmonic principles. Let us establish relations with them."

 NCH_united_in_race:0 "United in Race"
 NCH_united_in_race_desc:0 "After speaking at length with the hives in the new continent, one thing has become clear; even the supposedly peaceful Equestrians would reject our offers of friendship. Perhaps this Chrysalis character isn't off of her rocker after all..."

 NCH_intercontinental_contraband:0 "Intercontinental Contraband"
 NCH_intercontinental_contraband_desc:0 "Our allies have shown us much of what our kind can do. With their help, we can establish a large contraband network between our two continents, allowing for both of our countries to prosper."

 NCH_the_greneclyf_legion_desc:0 "We have worked with the Hives over on the other continent for some time, and Greneclyf is ready to step up to the plate. We shall stand with our allies, no matter the cost!"

 NCH_love_triumphs_desc:0 "Queen Chrysalis may be a powerful leader, but we shall not be swayed by her people's ways. Queen Gytha believes in the capacity of changelings everywhere to be open and accepted by other races."

 NCH_exchange_of_citizens:0 "Exchange of Citizens"
 NCH_exchange_of_citizens_desc:0 "Despite being bound by race, the Free Hives over the ocean are significantly different from us. Our two people have much to teach one another, and we need only allow them to do so."

 NCH_scleritian_socialism_desc:0 "Cader Sclerite has reappeared in the political scene with many proposals. These are considerably less extreme to what he has preached before, and the UCH's influence is clear in his work."

 NCH_intercontinental_trade:0 "Intercontinental Trade"
 NCH_intercontinental_trade_desc:0 "Now that we have established a line of communication with Equestria, it wouldn't take much for it to become one of commerce. Theirs is a rich continent, and any trade deal with Equestria will only benefit us."

 NCH_trading_with_the_continentals:0 "Trading with the Continentals"
 NCH_trading_with_the_continentals_desc:0 "Now that we have established our place in the continent, it is time for us to build upon it. With this small step, the hope is for all of the continent to become used to our kind. Perhaps, we may even convince the whole world..."

 NCH_equestrian_experts:0 "Equestrian Experts"
 NCH_equestrian_experts_desc:0 "We'll send a request for the Equestrian Principality to send us technical experts, as they have advanced much in their recent history. Being united in Harmony, we can expect them to be excellent teachers."

 NCH_set_up_an_academic_exchange_desc:0 "We may be benefitting from Equestrian Expertise on a state level, but not on a societal level. Plans have been made to set up a meeting of the academic minds between our two nations in order to correct this."

 NCH_establish_a_diplomatic_corps:0 "Establish a Diplomatic Corps"
 NCH_establish_a_diplomatic_corps_desc:0 "Greneclyf has been isolated for far too long. In order for us to truly enter the world stage we must have the actors for it, and only an official diplomatic corps will produce them."

 NCH_approach_equestria:0 "Approach Equestria"
 NCH_approach_equestria_desc:0 "Equestria is an example to Harmonic people everywhere. Surely they will agree to our offer to join their effort in making the world a better and safer place."

 ### CRISIS OF FAITH MAIN BRANCH ###

 NCH_crisis_of_faith:0 "Crisis of Faith"
 NCH_crisis_of_faith_desc:0 "They've all refuted our peaceful offers. Have we been wrong to trust in the idea of Harmony? Could it be the wrong path?"

 NCH_convene_the_council:0 "Convene the Council"
 NCH_convene_the_council_desc:0 "With the Queen refusing to see anyone, the Council of Royals must meet to try and resolve the gap that Gytha has left in her absence.\n\nPerhaps a new Queen is in order?"

 NCH_maintain_the_status_quo:0 "Maintain the Status Quo"
 NCH_maintain_the_status_quo_desc:0 "The Hive is in a state of crisis, and loathe as we are to admit it, only the Queen can lead us out of it. If we can get through to her, perhaps she will come up with a strategy."

 NCH_a_new_path:0 "A New Path"
 NCH_a_new_path_desc:0 "It's clear that Gytha's way is no longer viable for the prolonged survival of the Hive. We must now seriously reconsider our traditions and way of life if we are to survive in this uncertain world."

 NCH_look_inwards:0 "Look Inwards"
 NCH_look_inwards_desc:0 "Queen Gytha has recovered enough to take the helm of the state. She has correctly pointed to our need of volunteers that are willing to search beyond our island. We must first find these brave changelings."

 NCH_recruit_foreign_experts:0 "Recruit Foreign Experts"
 NCH_recruit_foreign_experts_desc:0 "There's much that the world beyond our island knows that we simply do not. We must search abroad for experts to help formulate our plans for the development of our country."

 NCH_scour_the_land:0 "Scour the Land"
 NCH_scour_the_land_desc:0 "Greneclyf has been our homes for untold generations, but just how well do we know it? An exhaustive survey of our land will be long and not yield immediate results, but it's the first step."

 NCH_digging_deep:0 "Digging Deep"
 NCH_digging_deep_desc:0 "Now that we have some idea of where the more precious resources lie on our island, we must start digging. It'll be a long and ardous project, but it will be worth it."

 NCH_blood_and_sweat:0 "Blood and Sweat"

 NCH_establish_a_schooling_system:0 "Establish a Schooling System"
 NCH_establish_a_schooling_system_desc:0 "With the mass illiteracy dealt with, we can now work with sages and elders to agree upon a standardised education system. With so many differing opinions, this will prove difficult to achieve."

 NCH_literacy_volunteer_brigades:0 "Literacy Volunteer Brigades"
 NCH_literacy_volunteer_brigades_desc:0 "The Changelings of Greneclyf have long been illiterate, to the point that it has directly hampered our societal development. Recruiting literate volunteers to teach others will be the best way to overcome this challenge."

 NCH_found_the_elder_academy:0 "Found the Royal Academy"
 NCH_found_the_elder_academy_desc:0 "With a proper schooling system in place, Greneclyf is now poised to build its first institution dedicated to higher learning. It may not be as prestigious as those abroad, but it shall serve our purposes just as well."

 NCH_support_local_artisans:0 "Support Local Artisans"
 NCH_support_local_artisans_desc:0 "Having no proper industry of our own, only the artisans are capable of producing anything. With proper support, they can form guilds and other such similar institutions, bringing together many workers to the fold."

 NCH_promote_corporate_entities:0 "Promote Corporate Entities"
 NCH_promote_corporate_entities_desc:0 "The next step in the industrial evolution, we must assist the artisan guilds into forming proper corporations. There will be much resistance from the very artisans that we're fighting to enfranchise, so this will be an ardous endeavour."

 NCH_inaugurate_the_industrial_district:0 "Inaugurate the Industrial District"
 NCH_inaugurate_the_industrial_district_desc:0 "It has been a long time coming, but we now can finally inaugurate the first district truly dedicated to the heavy industries in Blomsport! It may be dwarfed by those of other nations, but they too had to start with what we have. The possibilities are endless..."

 NCH_splendid_isolation:0 "Splendid Isolation"
 NCH_splendid_isolation_desc:0 "We have done what was necessary to adapt to the world around us, but it's clear that the outside world still fears us. Though things may change eventually, we shall stay put."

 ### CRISIS OF FAITH FASCISM ###

 NCH_the_old_ways:0 "The Old Ways"
 NCH_the_old_ways_desc:0 "We were foolish to believe that we could convince the outside world that we could be peaceful. Even our Queen recognizes the folly of her ways, and has agreed that Changelings will only be seen as duplicitous parasites."

 NCH_infiltrating_the_continent:0 "Infiltrating the Continent"
 NCH_infiltrating_the_continent_desc:0 "We are woefully ignorant of the current situation on the continent. Adopting our ancient techniques will allow us to send agents to relay news from the interior back to us."

 NCH_infiltrating_the_military:0 "Infiltrating the Military"
 NCH_infiltrating_the_military_desc:0 "Preliminary reports indicate that the world's militaries have advanced significantly. If we are to survive, we must learn from our rivals by placing agents in key position in numerous general staffs."

 NCH_take_the_initiative:0 "Take the Initiative"
 NCH_take_the_initiative_desc:0 "Our rivals are too preoccupied with infighting and from external attacks. This is the perfect opportunity for us to make our presence felt by the world. They wanted monsters? Well, now they've got monsters!"

 NCH_infiltrating_the_industries:0 "Infiltrating the Industries"
 NCH_infiltrating_the_industries_desc:0 "Where we have remained mostly agrarian, the world has developed machinery and heavy industry to radically improve production. It is clear that we must observe from the better industrialised countries to see what we can learn."

 NCH_infiltrating_the_academia:0 "Infiltrating the Academia"
 NCH_infiltrating_the_academia_desc:0 "Greneclyf is stuck in the medieval age, whereas everyone else has modernised. Infiltrating the more prestigious universities and academies is the clear first step in catching up with our rivals."

 NCH_operation_farseer:0 "Operation Farseer"
 NCH_operation_farseer_desc:0 "With many of our infiltrators in commanding positions, they can abduct, steal, and threaten the world's greatest minds to assist in our cause."

 NCH_passive_approach:0 "Passive Approach"
 NCH_passive_approach_desc:0 "Despite our efforts, it is clear that Greneclyf will never be in a position to directly challenge any of our enemies. As such, it is perhaps wiser for us to bide our time for a more opportune time and to adopt a defensive posture."

 NCH_plan_white:0 "The Farbrook Question"
 NCH_plan_white_desc:0 "The ponies of Farbrook have been our ancient friends, but there have been doubts among our own people regarding the Farbrookians' true feelings. Before we decide what must be done about Farbrook, we must better understand where they stand."

 NCH_invite_cader_sclerite:0 "Invite Cader Sclerite"
 NCH_invite_cader_sclerite_desc:0 "Cader Sclerite has long been a proponent of a foreign philosophy from abroad. In the past he had been sidelined for the Queen's more popular ideals, but now the idea of worker equality might just be what we need."

 NCH_find_a_compromise:0 "Find a Compromise"
 NCH_find_a_compromise_desc:0 "Sclerite is willing to do his part to better Greneclyf, but he has no interest in taking charge. Queen Gytha will remain in power, though Sclerite will be by her side from now on."

 NCH_remove_the_queen:0 "Remove the Queen"
 NCH_remove_the_queen_desc:0 "We'd rather be damned than wait for the Queen to gain back her senses. Despite what he otherwise says, Sclerite is our best chance to get out of this mess."

 NCH_collectivisation:0 "Collectivisation"
 NCH_collectivisation_desc:0 "With the Queen gone, Sclerite is free to apply his policies to their full extent. Revoking the rights of private workers may seem cruel, but it is a necessary step to rapidly increase production."

 NCH_unionisation:0 "Unionisation"
 NCH_unionisation_desc:0 "Long discussions between [Root.GetLeader] and Sclerite have yielded results. Sclerite's more extreme policies have been tempered to allow some worker rights and the existence of semi-private companies. "

 NCH_centralisation:0 "Centralisation"
 NCH_centralisation_desc:0 "Greneclyf has been a series of small hives under one Queen since time immemorial. This inefficiency must be addressed with a swift centralisation of power under one group rather than several."

 NCH_the_four_year_plan:0 "The Three Year Plan"
 NCH_the_four_year_plan_desc:0 "Now that our workers are united and power is centered around the government, Sclerite has unveiled a number of economic and industrial goals to be achieved over the course of three years. This will call for brutal efficiency and modernisation, and plenty of sweat and tears from our people."

 NCH_acquire_srfn_experts:0 "Acquire SRFG Experts"
 NCH_acquire_srfn_experts_desc:0 "The Socialist Republic of the Free Griffons, the same nation from which Sclerite had adopted his ideology, is host to many left-leaning experts. We must procure these experts, by any means necessary."

 NCH_establish_the_cis:0 "Establish the CIS"
 NCH_establish_the_cis_desc:0 "Our efforts of modernisation and industrialisation will undoubtedly draw out many dissenters from within and enemies from abroad. A new governmental organ, the Comissariat of Internal Security, will protect us from all political threats."

 NCH_a_red_curriculum:0 "A Red Curriculum"
 NCH_a_red_curriculum_desc:0 "To ensure better societal cohesion, we must address the application of the new school curriculum. History, philosophy and political sciences must reflect our changing world."

 NCH_form_an_intelligence_network:0 "Form an Intelligence Network"
 NCH_form_an_intelligence_network_desc:0 "Preliminary analyses by the CIS indicate that while our defenses are stout, we lack any meaningful offensive capacity. The CIS can apply external pressure abroad if we give them the resources to do so."

 NCH_a_red_academy:0 "A Red Academy"

 NCH_formalize_a_general_staff:0 "Form a General Staff"
 NCH_formalize_a_general_staff_desc:0 "Our isolation and traditions have limited our military progress, and it is evident in our lack of a dedicated officer staff. Going off from what we've observed, we can correct this deficiency."

 NCH_a_true_communist_state_desc:0 "Greneclyf has sustained so many hardships to finally reach this point. Our island state is no longer an isolated backwater but a modern state. We have made our introduction to the world, and it shall no longer mock us."

 NCH_perpetual_revolution:0 "Spreading the Revolution"
 NCH_perpetual_revolution_desc:0 "We have seen the outside world. There are too many enemies to the our way of life, even among those who fancy themselves as communists. We can only safeguard ourselves by taking the initiative."

 NCH_the_modern_changeling:0 "The Modern Changeling"
 NCH_the_modern_changeling_desc:0 "We can see how far we've come as a people in the last years, and we've become something different. We are neither antagonistic nor amicable: we are the modern pragmatists. We are the Modern Changelings."

 NCH_peaceful_infiltration:0 "Peaceful Infiltration"
 NCH_peaceful_infiltration_desc:0 "We have ancient ties to Farbrook, and although we must ensure their political loyalty, we can do so while sparing them from unnecessary bloodshed."

 NCH_a_more_direct_approach:0 "A More Direct Approach"

 NCH_infiltrate_the_federation_desc:0 "The River Federation is a behemoth, and there will be no chance for us to directly exert our influence upon them. Instead, a more subtle approach will be necessary to take the Federation down."

 NCH_reorganize_the_army_desc:0 "#TO BE ADDED"

 NCH_form_a_dedicated_officer_corps:0 "Form a Dedicated Officer Corps"
 NCH_form_a_dedicated_officer_corps_desc:0 "Traditionally, military officers are claimed exclusively by Royals who have shown an affinity towards the command of units and soldiers. While this may ensure a pool of competent leaders, it is limited by the number of possible candidates. Offering a military education as well as allowing the enrollment of Drones will expand that pool, and form a standard to which all future commanders will adhere to."

 NCH_the_industrial_question:0 "The Logistics Question"
 NCH_the_industrial_question_desc:0 "Modern land warfare requires an infrastructure of logistics on a scale previously unseen in Greneclyf, and it necessitates dedicated batallions solely responsible for maintaining lines of communication and supplies to keep our forces fighting for longer. As such, steps must be taken for to form such batallions, as well as the industrial capacity to supply the necessary supplies."

 NCH_purchase_production_licenses:0 "Purchase Production Licenses"
 NCH_purchase_production_licenses_desc:0 "Greneclyf has little experience with the use modern weapons, even less so with the production of them and their munitions. No matter what we do, any native designs will simply not compare to those of foreign designs. While we set aside the necessary funds to set up the necessary industries, we must search for weapon and equipment deals abroad."

 NCH_domestic_arms_factories:0 "Domestic Arms Factories"
 NCH_domestic_arms_factories_desc:0 "Our people have been fairly self-sufficient, so why should our weapons and military equipment industries be any different? Everything that we use should be of Greneclyfian origin. As we are searching for new designs domestically, Greneclyf must immediately begin a massive construction programme to be the foundation of our industries."

 ### NAVY BRANCH ###

 NCH_an_admiralty:0 "An Admiralty"
 NCH_an_admiralty_desc:0 "Being an island nation, Greneclyf will need to build up a maritime force. Before we can start however, we must have a structure with a dedicated naval corps of officers and theoriticians to get us started."

 NCH_support_admiral_petiole:0 "Support Admiral Farris's Plan"
 NCH_support_admiral_petiole_desc:0 "Changelings have the innate talent for subterfuge, and while its use in greater society can be discussed at length, Farris's plan for the seas applies that same philosophy to our vessels. Instead of the traditional surface ship, our main naval force should be underwater boats that can avoid detection and strike from below. Submarine warfare may be unorthodox, but it is both efficient and effective."

 NCH_go_all_in:0 "Accept Admiral Petiole's Petition"
 NCH_go_all_in_desc:0 "Adapting our navy to modern warfare will not be enough, and Admiral Petiole's petition goes into great technical detail on how Greneclyf can do better. He envisions the largest warship to have ever sailed the seas, based off of the great ships produced by Skyfall's naval yards, but larger, with more guns and armour. It will be a costly endeavour, but an unsinkable ship may very well be worth it."

 NCH_found_the_naval_academy:0 "Found the Naval Academy"
 NCH_found_the_naval_academy_desc:0 "Our initial drive for naval officers has produced some results, but it is clear that there must be an institution to ensure that Greneclyf will continue to produce great officers to serve their nations. Using the expertise of our current Admiralty, we can form an official naval academy for just that purpose."

 NCH_expand_the_naval_yards:0 "Expand the Naval Yards"
 NCH_expand_the_naval_yards_desc:0 "The current state of shipyards in Blomsport and other port settlements do not allow for the production of anything more than commercial vessels. If Greneclyf is to become a regional naval power, it must have the capacity to build its own new military vessels."

 NCH_proficient_packs:0 "The Icewaters Sharks"
 NCH_proficient_packs_desc:0 "The life of a submariner is stressful, especially when untrained and unprepared for wartime conditions. New plans put forward by Admiral Farris would designate parts of our territorial waters for use solely by the navy for war games and exercises.

 greneclyf.0.t:0 "Preparations for the Great Expedition"
 greneclyf.0.d:0 "It is clear that Greneclyf must put it's best hoof forwards in the coming days if we are ever going to extend our influence beyond our island and Farbrook. As such, there is much to worry about: logistics, routes, ships, and volunteers. Without these, we will not go far, so nothing must be left to chance.\n\nThese preparations will take time, but they are necessary to ensure that nothing will go wrong."
 greneclyf.0.a:0 "There is much work to do."

 greneclyf.1.t:0 "The Great Expedition"
 greneclyf.1.d:0 "The noon sun is shining high in the sky; the ships are all prepared to cast off; the intrepid sailors, cartographers and ambassadors of Greneclyf stand proudly to the ovation of the cheering multitudes; the day has finally arrived.\n\nDelegates from the Royal Houses and Queen Gytha herself are present to see off these brave changelings, and a rousing speech from Gytha moves many in the crowds —and more than a few of the ship crews— to joyful tears. After a lavish ceremony, all eyes were upon the departing vessels as they left port waters.\n\nWe can expect some of them to return within a few weeks, whereas the others will take far longer to bring back a response. Regardless, we will be waiting with for their return with gleeful anticipation."
 greneclyf.1.a:0 "A glorious day!"

 greneclyf.2.t:0 "A Delegation from Greneclyf"
 greneclyf.2.d:0 "Two ships from Greneclyf have arrived at Farbrook, filled to the brim with changelings. This in it of itself was strange, as traffic from the isle is usually no more than a few boats, but the fact that many political and governmental representatives were onboard was telling. Port authorities were immediately approached by these Greneclyfians, requesting an immediate audience with [Root.GetLeader].\n\nThe head delegate, speaking in Queen Gytha's name, has informed us of a shift in Greneclyf's policy. Their ship is one of many that are headed to various other nations in the continent, seeking a relation similar to our own. They've come to us proposing a number of amendments to the Great Pacts. The specifics are many, but the they mostly encompass an expansion on existing terms, namely a formalisation on the movement of our citizens between our nations. While some of the long-term objectives are somewhat ambitious, the short-term goal to enrichen our currently stale trade is a very realistic one.\n\nThe Greneclyfian diplomat stands before you, waiting for your response."
 greneclyf.2.a:0 "We shall honour our friends' wishes."
 greneclyf.2.b:0 "Now is not the most opportune time."

The crew and passengers arrived with the good and expected news of Farbrook's acceptance with our proposal. The wave of renewed travel between Greneclyf and Farbrook is due to begin soon. In the meantime, our delegates have been given a hero's welcome."
 greneclyf.3.a:0 "They've earned it."

 greneclyf.4.t:0 "Farbrook Postpones"
 greneclyf.4.d:0 "The ship to Farbrook has returned, but only with a curious message; Chief Cenhelm has abstained from giving a definite answer, and has asked for some more time to consider over our request. Our representative will keep asking for their response, but we can expect one within two months."

 greneclyf.5.t:0 "Greneclyf Awaits an Answer"
 greneclyf.5.d:0 "We have done what we could to postpone the question, but the Greneclyfian diplomat has made a final demand: we must give him an answer regarding his trade offer now, or else he will take our silence as a refusal.\n\nWhat shall be our official response?"

 greneclyf.6.t:0 "Farbrook Refuses"
 greneclyf.6.d:0 "The ship to Farbrook has finally returned, though with bad news. Despite our efforts, Farbrook has refused our request. In addition, while it wasn't explicitely stated, we can assume that the Great Pacts are no longer in effect, and that our friendship has ended."
 greneclyf.6.a:0 "But... but why?"

 greneclyf.7.t:0 "Farbrook Breaks off Relations"
 greneclyf.7.d:0 "We have finally gotten word back from Farbrook, but a stunned diplomat has returned to tell us of an utter cessation of all ties, official or otherwise, between our nations. The news have spread quickly, and a general sense of sorrow has gripped the hearts of many of our people, as many have friends over in Farbrook.\n\nThe Queen has done her best to calm down the populace, but despite her insistence otherwise, she too has suffered from the loss of her own relationship."

Many of our trading deals are failing, either by staunch refusal to our offers or by cessation of those accepted by the other parties. These have severely demoralised our people, but none more so than Queen Gytha. Upon hearing word of the latest failure, she lost herself in open despair, affecting a few too close to her. After much struggle, the Queen managed to sober up enough to close herself off in her personal chamber.\n\nShut off from everyone, the Queen has left no one on the seat of power, and no one is sure as to what can be done. As of right now, there is no one to look towards for a sense of stability, and panic is gripping the nation."
 greneclyf.29.a:0 "Sunderer protect us!"

 greneclyf.30.t:0 "The Council of Royals Deliberates"
 greneclyf.30.d:0 "All of the significant members of the Council have convened in Blomsport for the emergency call sent by those closest to the Queen. After several days of intense dialogue and discussion, an urgent matter has to be resolved today, namely what must be done with the Queen.\n\nFor past week Queen Gytha has been absent from nearly all affairs of statehood, after having locked herself in her private chambers, and is refusing to see anyone; not even her closest friends and advisors can reach to the Queen. With no one at the throne, Greneclyf risks collapse if the throne continues to remain empty. The Queen's House does not have a suitable replacement, and thus the Council's is considering to invoke a vote. Of the many candidates, Princess Oiren of House Aurelia is the prominent and plausible alternative.\n\nBeing the eldest Royal out of all of the suitable candidates —second only to the Queen— Oiren is a far more reserved Royal compared to Gytha, and has championed a more isolationist policy. This would fly in the face of a tradition that has been followed for centuries, and there are a few in the Council openly questioning Oiren's motives. She has insisted that her priorities are for Greneclyf first and foremost, and that her actions are not motivated by her House's ancient rivalry with House Lepidoptera, the Queen's House. Were the Council to invoke the vote, Oiren is certain to win, as all of the other viable candidates pale in comparison to her experience and popularity.\n\nSome of the Council are still hoping for Queen Gytha to recover from whatever is afflicting her, and that she will soon return to bring back at least some semblance of order. House Lepidotpera has ruled continually for centuries, and both its regents and their philosophies have brought us peace and stability. Perhaps the best course for Greneclyf is to wait for the Queen to come back to us."
 greneclyf.30.a:0 "Queen Gytha isn't wholly lost. We trust in a speedy recovery."

While the Council debates what to do, something dark has been taking root in Gytha's mind...\n\nHarmony was supposed to be the path, as it had been for centuries, but it has led us astray. The world refuses to help Greneclyf solely because of their primal fear of changelings. How can a changeling befriend someone who fears them? How can a changeling love someone who hates them? How can Gytha trust Cenhelm if he refuses to help her?\n\nWell, something from deep within the Queen has taken over, and it is ancient.\n\nA new hunger permeates the air wherever Gytha is present, and while she appears to have recovered from her break, there is something hidden behind her fanged smiles and glowing eyes. This is a changeling Royal reborn, and one who has a sole purpose now: protect and feed her Hive, no matter the cost.\n\nDark clouds are gathering on the isle, and they threaten to billow forth unto the continent."

At first, those closest to Gytha told of her adamantly frustrated by their ideological differences. Something has changed recently, however; the Greneclyfian Royal is no longer as approachable as she had been, and many wonder what could have brought about this change.\n\nRegardless, this shift has coincided with a breakthrough in the Royals' private negotiations. Greneclyf will serve as a faithful ally to our kin from across the sea, bound by the blood of our kind. Some still wonder if this new Queen Gytha will be prepared for this challenge, however..."

Surprisingly enough, a seemingly humbled Chrysalis accompanied Gytha to be shown the errors of her ways.\n\n"No more lying, no more scheming," said the Queen.

 NCH_meet_with_the_outsiders_desc:0 "The elders have spoken, and they are in agreement. We must mount an expedition to the world beyond to gain a better understanding of our world. We shall prepare immediately."

 NCH_beyond_the_continent:0 "Beyond the Continent?"
 NCH_beyond_the_continent_desc:0 "Much as we have come to know the griffons and ponies of the continent, there are rumours of another continent where the true world powers reside. We could mount an expedition to this continent instead."

 NCH_search_elsewhere:0 "Search Elsewhere"
 NCH_search_elsewhere_desc:0 "From what little we know, there is something brewing beyond the lands that we've kept in contact with. Perhaps it might be best to start our search there."

 NCH_contact_our_kind:0 "Contact our Kind"
 NCH_contact_our_kind_desc:0 "Our expedition has revealed something surprising: there are changelings on this other continent! Being closely related, they may be more inclined to assist us than other races. Be warned, however: there's something different about these changelings..."

 NCH_send_a_delegation_to_equestria_desc:0 "Of the countries that we've learned about, Equestria seems to be the best candidate for us to meet with. They are powerful, peaceful and, purportedly, agents of the Harmonic principles. Let us establish relations with them."

 NCH_united_in_race:0 "United in Race"
 NCH_united_in_race_desc:0 "After speaking at length with the hives in the new continent, one thing has become clear; even the supposedly peaceful Equestrians would reject our offers of friendship. Perhaps this Chrysalis character isn't off of her rocker after all..."

 NCH_intercontinental_contraband:0 "Intercontinental Contraband"
 NCH_intercontinental_contraband_desc:0 "Our allies have shown us much of what our kind can do. With their help, we can establish a large contraband network between our two continents, allowing for both of our countries to prosper."

 NCH_the_greneclyf_legion_desc:0 "We have worked with the Hives over on the other continent for some time, and Greneclyf is ready to step up to the plate. We shall stand with our allies, no matter the cost!"

 NCH_love_triumphs:0 "Love Triumphs"
 NCH_love_triumphs_desc:0 "Queen Chrysalis may be a powerful leader, but we shall not be swayed by her people's ways. Queen Gytha believes in the capacity of changelings everywhere to be open and accepted by other races."

 NCH_strictly_professional:0 "Strictly Professional"
 NCH_strictly_professional_desc:0 "We must make it clear to our 'partners' that we are not going to cave to their demands. We are working with them only because we must, nothing more."

 NCH_beacon_of_harmony:0 "Beacon of Harmony in the East"
 NCH_beacon_of_harmony_desc:0 "We have severely underestimated our capacity to resist the Hives' influence over us. It is only a matter of time that they will try to break us, so let us show them that we won't be cowed!"

 ### GOING WITH CCN ###

 NCH_bound_by_harmony:0 "Bound by Harmony"

 NCH_exchange_of_citizens:0 "Exchange of Citizens"
 NCH_exchange_of_citizens_desc:0 "Despite being bound by race, the Free Hives over the ocean are significantly different from us. Our two people have much to teach one another, and we need only allow them to do so."

 NCH_stand_with_our_kin:0 "Stand with our Kin"
 NCH_stand_with_our_kin_desc:0 "The world is a dangerous place, and though both Greneclyf and the Free Hives seek peace, we understand that we must stand together in face of the oncoming storm."

 NCH_transfer_societal_experts:0 "Transfer Societal Experts"
 NCH_transfer_societal_experts_desc:0 "The UCH have much more to teach us beyond their technical expertise. An exchange of their brightest societal minds will lead to a better understanding of the world around us."

 NCH_adapt_the_foreign_way:0 "Adapt the Foreign Way"
 NCH_adapt_the_foreign_way_desc:0 "The Hives under Gold Muffin are alien, but oddly compelling. There is a certain pragmatism to their ways that can explain their success. Perhaps we could adapt them to our society?"

 NCH_scleritian_socialism:0 "Scleritian Socialism"
 NCH_scleritian_socialism_desc:0 "Cader Sclerite has reappeared in the political scene with many proposals. These are considerably less extreme to what he has preached before, and the UCH's influence is clear in his work."

 NCH_the_eastern_bastion_desc:0 "We are communist, like our cousins from the West. No matter what will happen, Greneclyf shall be the Eastern Bastion of Changeling Communism."

 NCH_a_different_kind_of_changeling_desc:0 "Now that we've made a name for ourselves, we can show the world that we have evolved from what we once were under the Queen's philosophy.  Ancient grudges will be difficult to shake off, but we will eventually be accepted."

 NCH_encourage_migration_to_the_continent_desc:0 "In order to prove to the world that we bear no ill will, we can push for some of our more adventurous people to openly live among others on the continent. We're not expecting miracles, but it's the first step."

 NCH_continental_investors:0 "Continental Investors"
 NCH_continental_investors_desc:0 "Things have progressed well, to the point that there are a number of foreign investors interested in our land. Let's open the gates at long last!"

 NCH_intercontinental_trade:0 "Intercontinental Trade"
 NCH_intercontinental_trade_desc:0 "Now that we have established a line of communication with Equestria, it wouldn't take much for it to become one of commerce. Theirs is a rich continent, and any trade deal with Equestria will only benefit us."

 NCH_trading_with_the_continentals:0 "Trading with the Continentals"
 NCH_trading_with_the_continentals_desc:0 "Now that we have established our place in the continent, it is time for us to build upon it. With this small step, the hope is for all of the continent to become used to our kind. Perhaps, we may even convince the whole world..."

 NCH_equestrian_experts:0 "Equestrian Experts"
 NCH_equestrian_experts_desc:0 "We'll send a request for the Equestrian Principality to send us technical experts, as they have advanced much in their recent history. Being united in Harmony, we can expect them to be excellent teachers."

 NCH_set_up_an_academic_exchange:0 "Set up an Academic Exchange"
 NCH_set_up_an_academic_exchange_desc:0 "We may be benefitting from Equestrian Expertise on a state level, but not on a societal level. Plans have been made to set up a meeting of the academic minds between our two nations in order to correct this."

 NCH_establish_a_diplomatic_corps:0 "Establish a Diplomatic Corps"
 NCH_establish_a_diplomatic_corps_desc:0 "Greneclyf has been isolated for far too long. In order for us to truly enter the world stage we must have the actors for it, and only an official diplomatic corps will produce them."

 NCH_approach_equestria:0 "Approach Equestria"
 NCH_approach_equestria_desc:0 "Equestria is an example to Harmonic people everywhere. Surely they will agree to our offer to join their effort in making the world a better and safer place."

 ### CRISIS OF FAITH MAIN BRANCH ###

 NCH_crisis_of_faith:0 "Crisis of Faith"
 NCH_crisis_of_faith_desc:0 "They've all refuted our peaceful offers. Have we been wrong to trust in the idea of Harmony? Could it be the wrong path?"

 NCH_convene_the_council:0 "Convene the Council"
 NCH_convene_the_council_desc:0 "With the Queen refusing to see anyone, the Council of Royals must meet to try and resolve the gap that Gytha has left in her absence."

 NCH_maintain_the_status_quo_desc:0 "The Hive is in a state of crisis, and loathe as we are to admit it, only the Queen can lead us out of it. If we can get through to her, perhaps she will come up with a strategy."

 NCH_a_new_path:0 "A New Path"
 NCH_a_new_path_desc:0 "It's clear that Gytha's way is no longer viable for the prolonged survival of the Hive. She can still be our Queen, but we're calling the shots now."

 ### CRISIS OF FAITH HARMONY ###

 NCH_look_inwards:0 "Look Inwards"
 NCH_look_inwards_desc:0 "Queen Gytha has recovered enough to take the helm of the state. She has correctly pointed to our need of volunteers that are willing to search beyond our island. We must first find these brave changelings."

 NCH_recruit_foreign_experts:0 "Recruit Foreign Experts"
 NCH_recruit_foreign_experts_desc:0 "There's much that the world beyond our island knows that we simply do not. We must search abroad for experts to help formulate our plans for the development of our country."

 NCH_scour_the_land:0 "Scour the Land"
 NCH_scour_the_land_desc:0 "Greneclyf has been our homes for untold generations, but just how well do we know it? An exhaustive survey of our land will be long and not yield immediate results, but it's the first step."

 NCH_digging_deep:0 "Digging Deep"
 NCH_digging_deep_desc:0 "Now that we have some idea of where the more precious resources lie on our island, we must start digging. It'll be a long and ardous project, but it will be worth it."

 NCH_blood_and_sweat:0 "Blood and Sweat"
 NCH_blood_and_sweat_desc:0 "Our initial output has been less than we had originally anticipated. Harsher work regimes and stricter deadlines may be cruel, but they are ultimately necessary."

 NCH_a_selfmade_state:0 "A Self-Made State"
 NCH_a_selfmade_state_desc:0 "It has been a long and difficult journey, but we have finally achieved our ultimate goal: a modern state built by changelings, for changelings."

 NCH_establish_a_schooling_system:0 "Establish a Schooling System"
 NCH_establish_a_schooling_system_desc:0 "With the mass illiteracy dealt with, we can now work with sages and elders to agree upon a standardised education system. With so many differing opinions, this will prove difficult to achieve."

 NCH_literacy_volunteer_brigades:0 "Literacy Volunteer Brigades"
 NCH_literacy_volunteer_brigades_desc:0 "The Changelings of Greneclyf have long been illiterate, to the point that it has directly hampered our societal development. Recruiting literate volunteers to teach others will be the best way to overcome this challenge."

 NCH_found_the_elder_academy:0 "Found the Royal Academy"
 NCH_found_the_elder_academy_desc:0 "With a proper schooling system in place, Greneclyf is now poised to build its first institution dedicated to higher learning. It may not be as prestigious as those abroad, but it shall serve our purposes just as well."

 NCH_support_local_artisans:0 "Support Local Artisans"
 NCH_support_local_artisans_desc:0 "Having no proper industry of our own, only the artisans are capable of producing anything. With proper support, they can form guilds and other such similar institutions, bringing together many workers to the fold."

 NCH_promote_corporate_entities:0 "Promote Corporate Entities"
 NCH_promote_corporate_entities_desc:0 "The next step in the industrial evolution, we must assist the artisan guilds into forming proper corporations. There will be much resistance from the very artisans that we're fighting to enfranchise, so this will be an ardous endeavour."

 NCH_inaugurate_the_industrial_district:0 "Inaugurate the Industrial District"
 NCH_inaugurate_the_industrial_district_desc:0 "It has been a long time coming, but we now can finally inaugurate the first district truly dedicated to the heavy industries in Blomsport!

 NCH_splendid_isolation:0 "Splendid Isolation"
 NCH_splendid_isolation_desc:0 "We have done what was necessary to adapt to the world around us, but it's clear that the outside world still fears us. Though things may change eventually, we shall stay put."

 ### CRISIS OF FAITH FASCISM ###

 NCH_the_old_ways:0 "The Old Ways"
 NCH_the_old_ways_desc:0 "We were foolish to believe that we could convince the outside world that we could be peaceful. Even our Queen recognizes the folly of her ways, and has agreed that Changelings will only be seen as duplicitous parasites."

 NCH_infiltrating_the_continent:0 "Infiltrating the Continent"
 NCH_infiltrating_the_continent_desc:0 "We are woefully ignorant of the current situation on the continent. Adopting our ancient techniques will allow us to send agents to relay news from the interior back to us."

 NCH_infiltrating_the_military:0 "Infiltrating the Military"
 NCH_infiltrating_the_military_desc:0 "Preliminary reports indicate that the world's militaries have advanced significantly. If we are to survive, we must learn from our rivals by placing agents in key position in numerous general staffs."

 NCH_operation_brass:0 "Operation Brass"
 NCH_operation_brass_desc:0 "Our agents are in place: at our word, they will work to steal as many designs and plans as they can for us to learn from."

 NCH_take_the_initiative:0 "Take the Initiative"
 NCH_take_the_initiative_desc:0 "Our rivals are too preoccupied with infighting and from external attacks. This is the perfect opportunity for us to make our presence felt by the world. They wanted monsters? Well, now they've got monsters!"

 NCH_infiltrating_the_industries:0 "Infiltrating the Industries"
 NCH_infiltrating_the_industries_desc:0 "Where we have remained mostly agrarian, the world has developed machinery and heavy industry to radically improve production. It is clear that we must observe from the better industrialised countries to see what we can learn."

 NCH_operation_lightspark:0 "Operation Lightspark"
 NCH_operation_lightspark_desc:0 "With many corporations and syndical communes infiltrated, we can initiate a massive operation to copy the enemy's methods and means of production."

 NCH_infiltrating_the_academia:0 "Infiltrating the Academia"
 NCH_infiltrating_the_academia_desc:0 "Greneclyf is stuck in the medieval age, whereas everyone else has modernised. Infiltrating the more prestigious universities and academies is the clear first step in catching up with our rivals."

 NCH_operation_farseer:0 "Operation Farseer"
 NCH_operation_farseer_desc:0 "With many of our infiltrators in commanding positions, they can abduct, steal, and threaten the world's greatest minds to assist in our cause."

 NCH_passive_approach:0 "Passive Approach"
 NCH_passive_approach_desc:0 "Despite our efforts, it is clear that Greneclyf will never be in a position to directly challenge any of our enemies. As such, it is perhaps wiser for us to bide our time for a more opportune time and to adopt a defensive posture."

 NCH_plan_white:0 "Plan White"
 NCH_plan_white_desc:0 "Any future expansion to the continent will require a staging area. Farbrook, the land of backstabbers, will serve well as such."

 NCH_oversee_farbrook:0 "Oversee Farbrook"

 ### CRISIS OF FAITH COMMUNIST BRANCH ###

 NCH_invite_cader_sclerite:0 "Invite Cader Sclerite"
 NCH_invite_cader_sclerite_desc:0 "Cader Sclerite has long been a proponent of a foreign philosophy from abroad. In the past he had been sidelined for the Queen's more popular ideals, but now the idea of worker equality might just be what we need."

 NCH_find_a_compromise:0 "Find a Compromise"
 NCH_find_a_compromise_desc:0 "Sclerite is willing to do his part to better Greneclyf, but he has no interest in taking charge. Queen Gytha will remain in power, though Sclerite will be by her side from now on."

 NCH_remove_the_queen:0 "Remove the Queen"
 NCH_remove_the_queen_desc:0 "We'd rather be damned than wait for the Queen to gain back her senses. Despite what he otherwise says, Sclerite is our best chance to get out of this mess."

 NCH_collectivisation:0 "Collectivisation"
 NCH_collectivisation_desc:0 "With the Queen gone, Sclerite is free to apply his policies to their full extent. Revoking the rights of private workers may seem cruel, but it is a necessary step to rapidly increase production."

 NCH_unionisation:0 "Unionisation"
 NCH_unionisation_desc:0 "Long discussions between [Root.GetLeader] and Sclerite have yielded results. Sclerite's more extreme policies have been tempered to allow some worker rights and the existence of semi-private companies. "

 NCH_centralisation:0 "Centralisation"
 NCH_centralisation_desc:0 "Greneclyf has been a series of small hives under one Queen since time immemorial. This inefficiency must be addressed with a swift centralisation of power under one group rather than several."

 NCH_the_four_year_plan:0 "The Three Year Plan"
 NCH_the_four_year_plan_desc:0 "Now that our workers are united and power is centered around the government, Sclerite has unveiled a number of economic and industrial goals to be achieved over the course of three years. This will call for brutal efficiency and modernisation, and plenty of sweat and tears from our people."

 NCH_acquire_srfn_experts:0 "Acquire SRFG Experts"
 NCH_acquire_srfn_experts_desc:0 "The Socialist Republic of the Free Griffons, the same nation from which Sclerite had adopted his ideology, is host to many left-leaning experts. We must procure these experts, by any means necessary."

 NCH_establish_the_cis:0 "Establish the CIS"
 NCH_establish_the_cis_desc:0 "Our efforts of modernisation and industrialisation will undoubtedly draw out many dissenters from within and enemies from abroad. A new governmental organ, the Comissariat of Internal Security, will protect us from all political threats."

 NCH_a_red_curriculum:0 "A Red Curriculum"
 NCH_a_red_curriculum_desc:0 "To ensure better societal cohesion, we must address the application of the new school curriculum. History, philosophy and political sciences must reflect our changing world."

 NCH_form_an_intelligence_network:0 "Form an Intelligence Network"
 NCH_form_an_intelligence_network_desc:0 "Preliminary analyses by the CIS indicate that while our defenses are stout, we lack any meaningful offensive capacity. The CIS can apply external pressure abroad if we give them the resources to do so."

 NCH_a_red_academy:0 "A Red Academy"
 NCH_a_red_academy_desc:0 "Our future generations will be ardent supporters of communism, but they will never attain greatness without a higher education. An academy will solve that."

 NCH_formalize_a_general_staff:0 "Form a General Staff"
 NCH_formalize_a_general_staff_desc:0 "Our isolation and traditions have limited our military progress, and it is evident in our lack of a dedicated officer staff. Going off from what we've observed, we can correct this deficiency."

 NCH_restructure_the_military:0 "Restructure the Military"

 NCH_a_true_communist_state_desc:0 "Greneclyf has sustained so many hardships to finally reach this point. Our island state is no longer an isolated backwater but a modern state. We have made our introduction to the world, and it shall no longer mock us."

 NCH_perpetual_revolution:0 "Spreading the Revolution"
 NCH_perpetual_revolution_desc:0 "We have seen the outside world. There are too many enemies to the our way of life, even among those who fancy themselves as communists. We can only safeguard ourselves by taking the initiative."

 NCH_the_modern_changeling:0 "The Modern Changeling"
 NCH_the_modern_changeling_desc:0 "We can see how far we've come as a people in the last years, and we've become something different. We are neither antagonistic nor amicable: we are the modern pragmatists. We are the Modern Changelings."

 NCH_peaceful_infiltration:0 "Peaceful Infiltration"
 NCH_peaceful_infiltration_desc:0 "We have ancient ties to Farbrook, and while we must ensure their political loyalty, we can do so while sparing them from unnecessary bloodshed."

 NCH_a_more_direct_approach:0 "A More Direct Approach"
 NCH_a_more_direct_approach_desc:0 "History must not be an obstacle to progress, and Farbrook is no exception. Old friends will die, but it is for the greater good."

 NCH_infiltrate_the_federation:0 "Infiltrate the Federation"
 NCH_infiltrate_the_federation_desc:0 "The River Federation is a behemoth, and there will be no chance for us to directly exert our influence upon them. Instead, a more subtle approach will be necessary to take the Federation down."

 ### NAVY BRANCH ###

 NCH_an_admiralty:0 "An Admiralty"
 NCH_an_admiralty_desc:0 "Being an island nation, Greneclyf will need to build up a maritime force. Before we can start however, we must have a structure with a dedicated naval corps of officers and theoriticians to get us started."

 NCH_support_admiral_petiole:0 "Support Admiral Farris's Plan"
 NCH_support_admiral_petiole_desc:0 "Changelings have had the innate talent for subterfuge, and while its use in greater society can be discussed at length, Farris's plan for the seas applies that same philosophy to our vessels. Instead of the traditional surface ship, our main naval force should be underwater boats that can avoid detection and strike from below. Submarine warfare may be unorthodox, but it is both efficient and effective."

 NCH_go_all_in:0 "Accept Admiral Petiole's Petition"
 NCH_go_all_in_desc:0 "Adapting our navy to modern warfare will not be enough, and Admiral Petiole's petition goes into great technical detail on how Greneclyf can do better. He envisions the largest warship to have ever sailed the seas, based off of the great ships produced by Skyfall's naval yards, but larger, with more guns and armour. It will be a costly endeavour, but an unsinkable ship may very well be worth it."

 NCH_found_the_naval_academy:0 "Found the Naval Academy"
 NCH_found_the_naval_academy_desc:0 "Our initial drive for naval officers has produced some results, but it is clear that there must be an institution to ensure that Greneclyf will continue to produce great officers to serve their nations. Using the expertise of our current Admiralty, we can form an official naval academy for just that purpose."

 NCH_expand_the_naval_yards:0 "Expand the Naval Yards"
 NCH_expand_the_naval_yards_desc:0 "The current state of shipyards in Blomsport and other port settlements do not allow for the production of anything more than commercial vessels. If Greneclyf is to become a regional naval power, it must have the capacity to build its own new military vessels."

 NCH_proficient_packs:0 "The Icewaters Sharks"
 NCH_proficient_packs_desc:0 "The life of a submariner is stressful, especially when untrained and unprepared for wartime conditions. New plans put forward by Admiral Farris would designate parts of our territorial waters for use solely by the navy for war games and exercises. War may be the only true way to prepare our sailours for the hardships of war, but this is the next best alternative."

 NCH_lay_down_the_hatcher:0 "Lay Down the Hatcher"
 NCH_lay_down_the_hatcher_desc:0 "The designs have all been approved by naval engineers; the first Hatcher class is ready to be laid down in our shipyards. Soon, Greneclyf shall field the greatest and largest ship that the world will ever see!"

 NCH_torpedo_boats:0 "Torpedo Boats"
 NCH_torpedo_boats_desc:0 "Torpedoes have been used by Greneclyfian ships to protect themselves from pirates before cannons, and even powerful torpedoes don't require a large vessel to be effective. While large warships with great cannons have their place, smaller torpedo boats will prove just as deadly."

 NCH_the_mayfly_class:0 "The Mayfly Line"
 NCH_the_mayfly_class_desc:0 "A modern navy requires flexibility, and cruisers offer a great compromise between the heavy-hitting capacity of larger capital ships and the nimble speed of smaller destroyers.

 NCH_protected_cruisers:0 "The Borer Class"
 NCH_protected_cruisers_desc:0 "A hard look at Greneclyf's naval industry exposes an inconvenient truth: great battleships are both costly and take an exceedingly long amount of time to build. While we might never produce more than a few battleships, battlecruisers bring similair firepower for considerably cheaper. These shall be the mainstay ships of our nation."

 greneclyf.0.t:0 "Preparations for the Great Expedition"
 greneclyf.0.d:0 "It is clear that Greneclyf must put it's best hoof forwards in the coming days if we are ever going to extend our influence beyond our island and Farbrook. As such, there is much to worry about: logistics, routes, ships, and volunteers. Without these, we will not go far, so nothing must be left to chance.\n\nThese preparations will take time, but they are necessary to ensure that nothing will go wrong."
 greneclyf.0.a:0 "There is much work to do."

 greneclyf.1.t:0 "The Great Expedition"
 greneclyf.1.d:0 "The noon sun is shining high in the sky; the ships are all prepared to cast off; the intrepid sailors, cartographers and ambassadors of Greneclyf stand proudly to the ovation of the cheering multitudes; the day has finally arrived.\n\nDelegates from the Royal Houses and Queen Gytha herself are present to see off these brave changelings, and a rousing speech from Gytha moves many in the crowds —and more than a few of the ship crews— to joyful tears. After a lavish ceremony, all eyes were upon the departing vessels"

While many of our subjects reject the 'olden ways' that the strangers preach, there are a few that are willing to listen..."
 greneclyf.28.a:0 "How curious! Let's hope that they cause no trouble."

 greneclyf.29.t:0 "A Loss of Faith"
 greneclyf.29.d:0 "The reports have been both incessant and disheartening. Many of our trading deals are failing, either by staunch refusal to our offers or by cessation of those accepted by the other parties. These have severely demoralised our people, but none more so than Queen Gytha. Upon hearing word of the latest failure, she lost herself in open despair, affecting a few too close to her. After much struggle, the Queen managed to sober up enough to close herself off in her personal chamber from even her closest friends.\n\nThere's currently no one upon the seat of power, and no one is sure as to what can be done. As of right now, there is no one to look towards for a sense of stability, and panic is gripping the nation."
 greneclyf.29.a:0 "Sunderer protect us!"

 greneclyf..t:0 "A Revival of the Old Ways"
 greneclyf..d:0 "Much time has passed with the Queen absent from the affairs of state. While the Council debates what to do, something dark has been taking root in Gytha's mind...\n\nHarmony was supposed to be the path, as it had been for centuries, but it has led us astrayed. The world refuses to help Greneclyf solely because of their primal fear of changelings. How can a changeling befriend someone who fears them? How can a changeling love someone who hates them? How can Gytha trust Cenhelm if he refuses to help her?\n\nWell, something from deep within the Queen has taken over, and it is ancient.\n\nA new hunger permeates the air wherever Gytha is present, and while she appears to have recovered from her break, there is something hidden behind her fanged smiles and glowing eyes. This is a changeling Royal reborn, and one who has a sole purpose now: protect and feed her Hive, no matter the cost.\n\nDark clouds are gathering on the isle, and they threaten to billow forth unto the continent."
 greneclyf..a:0 "If it's monsters they want..."

 greneclyf..t:0 "Together Once More"
 greneclyf..d:0 "We have seen the other continent, and while there are many things that are disconcerting about Queen Chrysalis and her subjects, it is ultimately irrelevant — we are bound by biology.\n\nQueen Gytha and Chrysalis have spent much time in private discussing at great lengths as to how their respective nations can work better together moving forwards. At first, those closest to Gytha told of her adamantly frustrated by their ideological differences. Something has changed recently, however; the Greneclyfian Royal is no longer as approachable as she had been, and many wonder what could have brought about this change.\n\nRegardless, this shift has coincided with a breakthrough in the Royals' private negotiations. Greneclyf will serve as a faithful ally to our kin from across the sea, bound by the blood of our kind. Some still wonder if this new Queen Gytha will be prepared for this challenge, however..."
 greneclyf..a:0 "§GQueen Chrysalis was very convincing.§"


 greneclyf..t:0 "A Frank Talk Between Queens"
 greneclyf..d:0 "Many trembled in fear when they saw their queen's furious response to Chrysalis's challenge. While her erstwhile intent was to arrest Chrysalis, Queen Gytha instead decided to try to finally stamp out Chrysalis's ideals. Long hours passed after that first confrontation, leaving many waiting with bated breath for the outcome. Surprisingly enough, a seemingly humbled Chrysalis accompanied Gytha to be shown the errors of her ways.\n\n"No more lying, no more scheming," said the Queen. "Chrysalis's goals are united with Our own."\n\nSo with the two Royals finally in agreement, Greneclyf appears prepared to finally tackle the question of how to proceed in light of the great nations refusing our offers of peace and love. One thing is for certain though: Chrysalis shall work with Gytha as a close advisor."

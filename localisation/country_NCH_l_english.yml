 NCH_beyond_the_continent:0 "Beyond the Continent?"
 NCH_beyond_the_continent_desc:0 "Much as we have come to know the griffons and ponies of the continent, there are rumours of another continent where the true world powers reside. We could mount an expedition to this continent instead."

 NCH_send_a_delegation_to_equestria_desc:0 "Of the countries that we've learned about, Equestria seems to be the best candidate for us to meet with. They are powerful, peaceful and, purportedly, agents of the Harmonic principles. Let us establish relations with them."

 #### GOING WITH CHN ####

 NCH_foreign_advisors:0 "Foreign Advisors"

 NCH_united_in_race:0 "United in Race"
 NCH_united_in_race_desc:0 "After speaking at length with the hives in the new continent, one thing has become clear; even the supposedly peaceful Equestrians would reject our offers of friendship. Perhaps this Chrysalis character isn't off of her rocker after all..."

 NCH_intercontinental_contraband:0 "Intercontinental Contraband"
 NCH_intercontinental_contraband_desc:0 "Our allies have shown us much of what our kind can do. With their help, we can establish a large contraband network between our two continents, allowing for both of our countries to prosper."

 NCH_subterfuge_and_sabotage:0 "Subterfuge and Sabotage"
 NCH_subterfuge_and_sabotage_desc:0 "Why limit ourselves to mere black market trade? Our kind was made for duplicitous actions, and our allies will gladly share their secrets..."

 NCH_the_greneclyf_legion:0 "The Greneclyf Legion"
 NCH_the_greneclyf_legion_desc:0 "We have worked with the Hives over on the other continent for some time, and Greneclyf is ready to step up to the plate. We shall stand with our allies, no matter the cost!"

 NCH_love_triumphs:0 "Love Triumphs"
 NCH_love_triumphs_desc:0 "Queen Chrysalis may be a powerful leader, but we shall not be swayed by her people's ways. Queen Gytha believes in the capacity of changelings everywhere to be open and accepted by other races."

 NCH_strictly_professional:0 "Strictly Professional"

 NCH_beacon_of_harmony_desc:0 "We have severely underestimated our capacity to resist the Hives' influence over us. It is only a matter of time that they will try to break us, so let us show them that we won't be cowed!"

 NCH_exchange_of_citizens:0 "Exchange of Citizens"
 NCH_exchange_of_citizens_desc:0 "Despite being bound by race, the Free Hives over the ocean are significantly different from us. Our two people have much to teach one another, and we need only allow them to do so."

 NCH_adapt_the_foreign_way:0 "Adapt the Foreign Way"
 NCH_adapt_the_foreign_way_desc:0 "The Hives under Gold Muffin are alien, but oddly compelling. There is a certain pragmatism to their ways that can explain their success. Perhaps we could adapt them to our society?"

 NCH_scleritian_socialism:0 "Scleritian Socialism"
 NCH_scleritian_socialism_desc:0 "Cader Sclerite has reappeared in the political scene with many proposals. These are considerably less extreme to what he has preached before, and the UCH's influence is clear in his work."

 NCH_the_eastern_bastion_desc:0 "We are communist, like our cousins from the West. No matter what will happen, Greneclyf shall be the Eastern Bastion of Changeling Communism."

 NCH_a_different_kind_of_changeling:0 "A Different Kind of Changeling"
 NCH_a_different_kind_of_changeling_desc:0 "Incidents abroad have led to rumours that balooned into outright discrimination against our people on the continent.

 NCH_intercontinental_trade:0 "Intercontinental Trade"
 NCH_intercontinental_trade_desc:0 "Now that we have established a line of communication with Equestria, it wouldn't take much for it to become one of commerce. Theirs is a rich continent, and any trade deal with Equestria will only benefit us."

 NCH_trading_with_the_continentals:0 "Trading with the Continentals"
 NCH_trading_with_the_continentals_desc:0 "Now that we have established our place in the continent, it is time for us to build upon it. With this small step, the hope is for all of the continent to become used to our kind. Perhaps, we may even convince the whole world..."

 NCH_equestrian_experts:0 "Equestrian Experts"
 NCH_equestrian_experts_desc:0 "We'll send a request for the Equestrian Principality to send us technical experts, as they have advanced much in their recent history. Being united in Harmony, we can expect them to be excellent teachers."

 NCH_approach_the_federation:0 "Approach the Coalition"
 NCH_approach_the_federation_desc:0 "The River Coalition is the closest major power. Though perhaps not as centralised as a nation like Equestria, we can expect more immediate support from allies in the Riverlands than from those across the ocean."

 ### CRISIS OF FAITH MAIN BRANCH ###

 NCH_a_new_path:0 "A New Path"
 NCH_a_new_path_desc:0 "It's clear that Gytha's way is no longer viable for the prolonged survival of the Hive. We must now seriously reconsider our traditions and way of life if we are to survive in this uncertain world."

 ### CRISIS OF FAITH HARMONY ###

 NCH_look_inwards:0 "Look Inwards"
 NCH_look_inwards_desc:0 "Queen Gytha has recovered enough to take the helm of the state. She has correctly pointed to our need of volunteers that are willing to search beyond our island. We must first find these brave changelings."

 NCH_recruit_foreign_experts:0 "Recruit Foreign Experts"
 NCH_recruit_foreign_experts_desc:0 "There's much that the world beyond our island knows that we simply do not. We must search abroad for experts to help formulate our plans for the development of our country."

 NCH_scour_the_land:0 "Scour the Land"
 NCH_scour_the_land_desc:0 "Greneclyf has been our homes for untold generations, but just how well do we know it? An exhaustive survey of our land will be long and not yield immediate results, but it's the first step."

 NCH_digging_deep:0 "Digging Deep"
 NCH_digging_deep_desc:0 "Now that we have some idea of where the more precious resources lie on our island, we must start digging. It'll be a long and ardous project, but it will be worth it."

 NCH_blood_and_sweat:0 "Blood and Sweat"
 NCH_blood_and_sweat_desc:0 "Our initial output has been less than we had originally anticipated. Harsher work regimes and stricter deadlines may be cruel, but they are ultimately necessary."

 NCH_a_selfmade_state:0 "A Self-Made State"
 NCH_a_selfmade_state_desc:0 "It has been a long and difficult journey, but we have finally achieved our ultimate goal: a modern state built by changelings, for changelings."

 NCH_establish_a_schooling_system:0 "Establish a Schooling System"
 NCH_establish_a_schooling_system_desc:0 "With the mass illiteracy dealt with, we can now work with sages and elders to agree upon a standardised education system. With so many differing opinions, this will prove difficult to achieve."

 NCH_literacy_volunteer_brigades:0 "Literacy Volunteer Brigades"
 NCH_literacy_volunteer_brigades_desc:0 "The changelings of Greneclyf have long been illiterate, to the point that it has directly hampered our societal development. Recruiting literate volunteers to teach others will be the best way to overcome this challenge."

 NCH_found_the_elder_academy:0 "Found the Royal Academy"
 NCH_found_the_elder_academy_desc:0 "With a proper schooling system in place, Greneclyf is now poised to build its first institution dedicated to higher learning. It may not be as prestigious as those abroad, but it shall serve our purposes just as well."

 NCH_support_local_artisans:0 "Support Local Artisans"
 NCH_support_local_artisans_desc:0 "Having no proper industry of our own, only the artisans are capable of producing anything. With proper support, they can form guilds and other such similar institutions, bringing together many workers to the fold."

 NCH_promote_corporate_entities:0 "Promote Corporate Entities"
 NCH_promote_corporate_entities_desc:0 "The next step in the industrial evolution, we must assist the artisan guilds into forming proper corporations. There will be much resistance from the very artisans that we're fighting to enfranchise, so this will be an ardous endeavour."

 NCH_inaugurate_the_industrial_district:0 "Inaugurate the Industrial District"
 NCH_inaugurate_the_industrial_district_desc:0 "It has been a long time coming, but we now can finally inaugurate the first district truly dedicated to the heavy industries in Blosmport! It may be dwarfed by those of other nations, but they too had to start with what we have. The possibilities are endless..."

 ### CRISIS OF FAITH FASCISM ###

 NCH_the_old_ways:0 "Stair Grena"
 NCH_the_old_ways_desc:0 "Greneclyfians everywhere are still reeling from the rejection of the ponies on the continent. The Leamhan philosophy has been soundly discredited, and our way of life has been put into question. Perhaps, delving deep into our people's history, we shall uncover an answer to our dilemma?"

 NCH_begin_army_reforms:0 "Láidreachtaí Agus Laigí"
 NCH_begin_army_reforms_desc:0 "Every changeling in Greneclyf knows of their innate ability to take on the form and voice of any other creature. They've however been raised to resist the urge to use these powers for ill intents. After what has happened, however, we must recognise this strength and stop treating it as a weakness. It is a gift, not a curse!"
 
 NCH_infiltrator_network:0 "Infiltrate The Hillponies"
 NCH_infiltrator_network_desc:0 "Before, when we could call the Hillponies of Farbrook friends, we merely visited their lands. If we genuinely wish to learn about the greater world, we must put our gift to good use and mingle among the continentals.\n\nWe shall return, not as friends, but as rivals."
 
 NCH_expand_the_networks:0 "Spread Into The Riverlands"
 NCH_expand_the_networks_desc:0 "We've learned much about the Hillponies, and we were almost shocked to find that they are a split people vulnerable to attack. Perhaps now that we know better, we can study those who'd chase us from the continent. The Riverlands are more advanced and must be carefully observed if we're to find any weaknesses to exploit."
 
 NCH_scientific_development:0 "Ré an Réasúin"
 NCH_scientific_development_desc:0 "New ideas and concepts from the continent are filtering through our spies, and our newly-forged Greneclyfians are prepared to use them to good use. This will spark a new age of reason that has long been overdue in Greneclyf."
 
 NCH_clan_oiren_generals:0 "Bringing Back the Deoraithe"
 NCH_clan_oiren_generals_desc:0 "Long ago, members of Clann Óir had once been banished to the deep forests and hills of Aisling because of their unique interpretations of history. What remains of the Exiled are a surprisingly hardy and cunning folk that any Leamhan would have considered barbaric. In such times, however, we can resolve our differences and bring them back into the fold."
 
 NCH_oiren_crusaders:0 "An Cine Tofa"
 NCH_oiren_crusaders_desc:0 "Changelings are the product of the Great Hatcher Below, the first and only emotivores of the world. Others call us parasites, but if left to our own devices, we can easily dominate any sentient creature. We must take this fact to heart, and realise that the Sunderer's sacrifice would be for nought if we do not assert ourselves as we were created to. For we are the Chosen People."
 
 NCH_holy_factories:0 "Oibrithe Dílse"
 NCH_holy_factories_desc:0 "There is a natural order to all things, and the changeling castes are no different. The Drones are and will always be subordinate to the Royals. All that needs to be done is to ensure their loyalty and efficiency, no matter their trade or position."
 
 NCH_warrior_traditions:0 "The Modern Changeling"
 NCH_warrior_traditions_desc:0 "Much time has been devoted to reconciling with the Deoraithe and ourselves. Our histories are once more aligned, and we are united in thought. There is much work left to be done if we're to be counted among the great, but we've shaken off the inane notions of pacifism that shackled our strengths. The Modern Greneclyfian has finally arrived to make her mark upon the world."
 
 NCH_fascist_education:0 "Teach The People"
 NCH_fascist_education_desc:0 "Greneclyfians have the will, and we must provide them with the means, be they material or mental. The latter has been lagging behind for too long and must be corrected."
 
 NCH_the_swarm:0 "An Saithí, a Rugadh Arís!"
 NCH_the_swarm_desc:0 "A sense of purpose has spread across all walks of Greneclyfian life. Even among the drone-at-arms are inspired, for a single unifying cheer can be heard in almost every hive:\n\n"The Swarm, reborn!""
 
 NCH_memories_of_the_homeland:0 "Stoke the Memories of Tír Dhúchais"
 NCH_memories_of_the_homeland_desc:0 "Vague tales recall of a time where changelings once lived on the continent. We may have been content living on our home isle of Greneclyf, but that changes today. Studies of ancient tales and scripts can help us delineate a continental territory where we once used to live... and where we shall return to."

 NCH_go_at_it_alone:0 "Greneclyf Over All"
 NCH_go_at_it_alone_desc:0 "We have tried seeking alliances and friendship from the continent and beyond. We've already felt the painful sting of xenophobia and none of our people wish to experience it again. If there is to be an alliance, Greneclyf should assume a leading role."

 NCH_reorganize_the_army:0 "Reorganising the Army"
 NCH_reorganize_the_army_desc:0 "For time immemorial, there has been no 'standing army' in Greneclyf. The closest thing to it has been the Household Guard. Being the only professional soldiers, the drones-at-arms typically levied by the many Clanns simply do not compare. We must take immediate steps to reform our military thinking and our methods."

 NCH_form_a_dedicated_officer_corps:0 "Form a Dedicated Officer Corps"
 NCH_form_a_dedicated_officer_corps_desc:0 "Traditionally, military officers are exclusively Royals who have shown an affinity towards the command of units and soldiers. While this may ensure a pool of competent leaders, its size is limited by the number of possible candidates. Offering a military education as well as allowing the enrollment of Drones will expand that pool, and form a standard to which all future commanders will adhere to."

 NCH_the_industrial_question:0 "The Logistics Question"
 NCH_the_industrial_question_desc:0 "Modern land warfare requires an infrastructure of logistics on a scale previously unseen in Greneclyf, and it necessitates dedicated batallions solely responsible for maintaining lines of communication and supplies to keep our forces fighting for longer. As such, steps must be taken for to form such batallions, as well as the industrial capacity to supply the necessary supplies."

 NCH_purchase_production_licenses:0 "Purchase Production Licenses"
 NCH_purchase_production_licenses_desc:0 "Greneclyf has little experience with the use modern weapons, even less so with the production of them and their munitions. No matter what we do, any native designs will simply not compare to those of foreign designs. While we set aside the necessary funds to set up the necessary industries, we must search for weapon and equipment deals abroad."

 NCH_domestic_arms_factories:0 "Domestic Arms Factories"
 NCH_domestic_arms_factories_desc:0 "Our people have been fairly self-sufficient, so why should our weapons and military equipment industries be any different? Everything that we use should be of Greneclyfian origin. As we are searching for new designs domestically, Greneclyf must immediately begin a massive construction programme to be the foundation of our industries."

 NCH_limited_expansion:0 "Limited Expansion"
 NCH_limited_expansion_desc:0 "We mustn't upset the current environment with the expansion of our current guilds and workshops. Our crafters and metalworkers must be allowed to adapt to the new requirements and tools, lest we bring about unrest among the guilds."

 NCH_modern_artillery:0 "Greda Guns"
 NCH_modern_artillery_desc:0 "Wingbardy's heavy weapons have long been renowned for their efficacy, and many have called their artillery the most fearsome on the continent. Greda is an old cannon designer, and they may be willing to share their designs with us if we make a good enough offer."

 NCH_heavy_weapons_desc:0 "Perhaps less radical of an idea than a hoof-held firearm, bombards and cannons have nevertheless not been part of Greneclyfian combined arms.

 NCH_end_the_deals:0 "Terminate the Licenses"
 NCH_end_the_deals_desc:0 "We have learned what we could from the strangers, so we should consider adapting what we've purchased to suit our industrial capacity.

 NCH_tighten_conscription_regulations:0 "Tighten Conscription Regulations"
 NCH_tighten_conscription_regulations_desc:0 "There is a reason why only the best were recruited into the Household Guard of old, and while we may loosen some of the more stringent requirements for enrollment into the Guard itself, we should still be looking for the best to form our file and rank."

 NCH_call_to_arms:0 "Call to Arms"
 NCH_call_to_arms_desc:0 "We are few in numbers, and a fight with the throngs of griffons and ponies would easily overwhelm our forces.

 NCH_perfected_planning:0 "Perfect Planning"
 NCH_perfected_planning_desc:0 "Our people can only offer so many soldiers, so we should not needlessly squander them. We can avoid useless losses by having a doctrinal goal at every level of the army: from the tactical to the strategic, every move will be done according to a grand plan."

 NCH_rethinking_aerial_warfare_desc:0 "By all accounts we've always had a sort of 'air force' in the sense of high flying drones that serve as battlefield disrupters. But in this modern age of warfare exist flying machines that can be equipped with fully automatic weapons—far larger than anything a single drone could carry, much less fly with. In order to have a properly modern military, we'll need to dive into this brand new field of military science."

 NCH_rock_mountain_base:0 "Bugsmere Air Base"
 NCH_rock_mountain_base_desc:0 "Much like the ancient city-hive of Bugsmere, the innards of the mountains will shelter our main air base. Conventional wisdom may say that the best location would be open terrain, but if war is to come to Greneclyf, a protected base of aerial operations will prove a challenging target for any enemy."

 NCH_aerial_experiments:0 "Aerial Experiments"
 NCH_aerial_experiments_desc:0 "We know ourselves best, so we are best positioned to make aircraft designed around ourselves. Native designs may perhaps not perform as well compared to foreign crafts, but will be simpler to produce en masse."

 NCH_search_for_foreign_designs:0 "Search for Foreign Designs"
 NCH_search_for_foreign_designs_desc:0 "None of our craftsworkers have ever even conceived of a flying craft, so whatever design they could come up with would never be on par with those of more modern nations. It is perhaps better to acquiesce to the costly designs for better perfoming aircraft."

 NCH_flight_schools:0 "Flight Schools"
 NCH_flight_schools_desc:0 "Aside from actually having aircraft to use, we'll need changelings suited to pilot them as well. Unlike regular army work, being a pilot requires a whole different set of talents such as good eyesight, quick reactions, and a strong stomach. By propping up schools dedicated purely to squeezing out the best pilots from our population, we'll know that our aircraft are in good hooves."

 NCH_foreign_pilots:0 "Foreign Instructors"
 NCH_foreign_pilots_desc:0 "We have the planes, but being of non-Greneclyfian design, no changeling is best qualified to teach our pilots how to fly them. As such, we will need to recruit suitably experienced instructors from abroad so that our pilots can fly their planes as if they were merely an extension of themselves."
 
 NCH_sound_designs:0 "Sound Designs"
 NCH_sound_designs_desc:0 "Aircraft are still a young art of engineering, as such there is no reason to go crazy and dive into strange fields. What's been tried and tested thus far is what we should stick with; leave the experimentation to the Industrial Giants of the far West who actually have the resources to meddle in such things."

 NCH_radical_designs:0 "Radical Designs"
 NCH_radical_designs_desc:0 "We lack the industry to mass produce aircraft and the population to continually sustain a fleet of them. Our only choice is to fight brawn with brain and push our models to their very limit. There is no doubt that our airdrones will be outnumbered in the air, so they'll need every possible advantage against the opposition's own dogfighters."


 ### NAVY BRANCH ###

 NCH_an_admiralty:0 "An Admiralty"
 NCH_an_admiralty_desc:0 "Being an island nation, Greneclyf will need to build up a maritime force. Before we can start however, we must have a structure with a dedicated naval corps of officers and theoriticians to get us started."

 NCH_support_admiral_petiole:0 "Support Admiral Fallon's Plan"
 NCH_support_admiral_petiole_desc:0 "Changelings have the innate talent for subterfuge, and while its use in greater society can be discussed at length, Fallon's plan for the seas applies that same philosophy to our vessels. Instead of the traditional surface ship, our main naval force should be underwater boats that can avoid detection and strike from below. Submarine warfare may be unorthodox, but it is both efficient and effective."

 NCH_go_all_in:0 "Accept Admiral Poethgils's Petition"
 NCH_go_all_in_desc:0 "Adapting our navy to modern warfare will not be enough, and Admiral Poethgils's petition goes into great technical detail on how Greneclyf can do better. He envisions the largest warship to have ever sailed the seas, based off of the great ships produced by Skyfall's naval yards, but larger, with more guns and armour. It will be a costly endeavour, but an unsinkable ship may very well be worth it."

 NCH_found_the_naval_academy:0 "Found the Naval Academy"
 NCH_found_the_naval_academy_desc:0 "Our initial drive for naval officers has produced some results, but it is clear that there must be an institution to ensure that Greneclyf will continue to produce great officers to serve their nations. Using the expertise of our current Admiralty, we can form an official naval academy for just that purpose."

 NCH_expand_the_naval_yards:0 "Expand the Naval Yards"
 NCH_expand_the_naval_yards_desc:0 "The current state of shipyards in Blosmport and other port settlements do not allow for the production of anything more than commercial vessels. If Greneclyf is to become a regional naval power, it must have the capacity to build its own new military vessels."

 NCH_proficient_packs:0 "The Icewaters Sharks"
 NCH_proficient_packs_desc:0 "The life of a submariner is stressful, especially when untrained and unprepared for wartime conditions. New plans put forward by Admiral Farris would designate parts of our territorial waters for use solely by the navy for war games and exercises. War may be the only true way to prepare our sailours for the hardships of war, but this is the next best alternative."

 NCH_lay_down_the_hatcher:0 "Lay Down the Hatcher"
 NCH_lay_down_the_hatcher_desc:0 "The designs have all been approved by naval engineers; the first Hatcher class is ready to be laid down in our shipyards. Soon, Greneclyf shall field the greatest and largest ship that the world will ever see!"

 NCH_torpedo_boats:0 "Torpedo Boats"
 NCH_torpedo_boats_desc:0 "Torpedoes have been used by Greneclyfian ships to protect themselves from pirates before cannons, and even powerful torpedoes don't require a large vessel to be effective. While large warships with great cannons have their place, smaller torpedo boats will prove just as deadly."

 NCH_the_mayfly_class:0 "The Mayfly Line"
 NCH_the_mayfly_class_desc:0 "A modern navy requires flexibility, and cruisers offer a great compromise between the heavy-hitting capacity of larger capital ships and the nimble speed of smaller destroyers. Whether light or armoured, our cruisers shall fill a number of roles that will prove invaluable in a future naval conflict."

 NCH_protected_cruisers:0 "The Borer Class"
 NCH_protected_cruisers_desc:0 "A hard look at Greneclyf's naval industry exposes an inconvenient truth: great battleships are both costly and take an exceedingly long amount of time to build. While we might never produce more than a few battleships, battlecruisers bring similair firepower for considerably cheaper. These shall be the mainstay ships of our nation."

 greneclyf.0.d:0 "It is clear that Greneclyf must put it's best hoof forwards in the coming days if we are ever going to extend our influence beyond our island and Farbrook. As such, there is much to worry about: logistics, routes, ships, and volunteers. Without these, we will not go far, so nothing must be left to chance.\n\nThese preparations will take time, but they are necessary to ensure that nothing will go wrong."
 greneclyf.0.a:0 "There is much work to do."

 greneclyf.1.t:0 "The Great Expedition"
 greneclyf.1.d:0 "The noon sun is shining high in the sky; the ships are all prepared to cast off; the intrepid sailors, cartographers and ambassadors of Greneclyf stand proudly to the ovation of the cheering multitudes; the day has finally arrived.\n\nDelegates from the Royal Houses and Queen Gytha herself are present to see off these brave changelings, and a rousing speech from Gytha moves many in the crowds —and more than a few of the ship crews— to joyful tears. After a lavish ceremony, all eyes were upon the departing vessels as they left port waters.\n\nWe can expect some of them to return within a few weeks, whereas the others will take far longer to bring back a response. Regardless, we will be waiting with for their return with gleeful anticipation."
 greneclyf.1.a:0 "A glorious day!"

 ###TRADES###
 greneclyf.2.t:0 "A Delegation from Greneclyf"
 greneclyf.2.d:0 "A ship from Greneclyf have arrived at Farbrook, filled to the brim with changelings. This in it of itself was strange, as traffic from the isle is usually no more than a few fishing vessels, but the fact that many political and governmental representatives were onboard was telling. Port authorities were immediately approached by these Greneclyfians, requesting an immediate audience with [Root.GetLeader].\n\nThe head delegate, speaking in Queen Gytha's name, has informed us of a shift in Greneclyf's policy. Their ship is one of many that are headed to various other nations in the continent, seeking a relation similar to our own. They've come to us proposing a number of amendments to the Great Pacts. The specifics are many, but the they mostly encompass an expansion on existing terms, namely a formalisation on the movement of our citizens between our nations. While some of the long-term objectives are somewhat ambitious, the short-term goal to enrichen our currently stale trade is a very realistic one.\n\nThe Greneclyfian diplomat stands before you, waiting for your response."
 greneclyf.2.a:0 "We shall honour our friends' wishes."
 greneclyf.2.b:0 "Now is not the most opportune time."

 greneclyf.3.t:0 "Farbrook Agrees"
 greneclyf.3.d:0 "One of our ships, the one that was bound for Farbrook, has finally returned to Blosmport. The crew and passengers arrived with the good and expected news of Farbrook's acceptance with our proposal. The wave of renewed travel between Greneclyf and Farbrook is due to begin soon. In the meantime, our delegates have been given a hero's welcome."
 greneclyf.3.a:0 "They've earned it."

 greneclyf.4.t:0 "Farbrook Postpones"
 greneclyf.4.d:0 "The ship to Farbrook has returned, but only with a curious message; Chief Cenhelm has abstained from giving a definite answer, and has asked for some more time to consider over our request. Our representative will keep asking for their response, but we can expect one within two months."
 greneclyf.4.a:0 "What is there to think over?"

 greneclyf.5.t:0 "Greneclyf Awaits an Answer"
 greneclyf.5.d:0 "We have done what we could to postpone the question, but the Greneclyfian diplomat has made a final demand: we must give him an answer regarding his trade offer now, or else he will take our silence as a refusal.\n\nWhat shall be our official response?"
 greneclyf.5.a:0 "We shall honour our friends' wishes."
 greneclyf.5.b:0 "We can't accept this."
 greneclyf.5.c:0 "Send them home. They are no longer welcome."

 greneclyf.6.t:0 "Farbrook Refuses"
 greneclyf.6.d:0 "The ship to Farbrook has finally returned, though with bad news. Despite our efforts, Farbrook has refused our request. In addition, while it wasn't explicitely stated, we can assume that the Great Pacts are no longer in effect, and that our friendship has ended."
 greneclyf.6.a:0 "But... but why?"

 greneclyf.7.t:0 "Farbrook Breaks off Relations"
 greneclyf.7.d:0 "We have finally gotten word back from Farbrook, but a stunned diplomat has returned to tell us of an utter cessation of all ties, official or otherwise, between our nations. The news have spread quickly, and a general sense of sorrow has gripped the hearts of many of our people, as many have friends over in Farbrook.\n\nThe Queen has done her best to calm down the populace, but despite her insistence otherwise, she too has suffered from the loss of her own relationship."
 greneclyf.7.a:0 "Have they lost their minds?!"

 greneclyf.8.t:0 "Love Leeches Wish to Trade"
 greneclyf.8.d:0 "Changelings, ancient monsters capable of shapeshifting and sucking their victims dry emotionally, arrived upon our shores with the offer to trade. Hailing from the island of Greneclyf, these insectoid ponies have come with urgent request to open up trade routes as part of a national effort to promote Harmonic elements in their society. On the one hoof, they're changelings who shouldn't be trusted, as per the old mares' tales. On the other hoof, they are still tales. Perhaps we should give these bugs a shot and show us how Harmonic they really are."
 greneclyf.8.a:0 "If these changelings are truly Harmonic, we will soon find out."
 greneclyf.8.b:0 "Never! These creatures are nothing but beasts; wolves in sheep's clothing!"

 greneclyf.9.t:0 "Bakara Agrees"
 greneclyf.9.d:0 "Our envoy to Bakara returned home today with news of acceptance. While reluctant at first, our envoy had to answer a long series of questions in regard to a Harmonic lifestyle before finally getting the official agreement signed. Then they had to do community service for the rest of the day to prove their claims of being Harmonists..."
 greneclyf.9.a:0 "Good, but... is that normal for them?"

 greneclyf.10.t:0 "Bakara Refuses"
 greneclyf.10.d:0 "Our envoy to Bakara returned home today to give the unfortunate news of rejection. Despite our earnest attempts to sway them, the leadership there simply would not be convinced that we changelings are capable of a Harmonic lifestyle! Not to mention the envoy was initially greeted with a slew of insults regarding how we eat."
 greneclyf.10.a:0 "I didn't know that they had such colourful language!"

 greneclyf.11.t:0 "A Delegation of Bugs"
 greneclyf.11.d:0 "Some sudden news came today in the form of ships hoisting a flag of unknown origin landing in port under the guise of peace. Aboard these weaponless convoys were insectoid creatures called changelings. Previously all that was known about them came from old foal's tales of they being emotion leeching parasites, though the real life counterparts appear docile, small, and weak. They came offering iron and steel along with their own brand of textile products in exchange for our own goods. They seem harmless enough..."
 greneclyf.11.a:0 "They're completely harmless, and Nimbusia could always have more friends than enemies."
 greneclyf.11.b:0 "They're pitiful and weak. They can buy their safety with their ship."

 greneclyf.12.t:0 "Nimbusia Agrees"
 greneclyf.12.d:0 "Our diplomatic envoy to Nimbusia has returned with the good news! Nimbusian merchants should be arriving in Greneclyf anytime within the coming weeks and we're free to trade with the pegasi of Nimbusia!"
 greneclyf.12.a:0 "Send our thanks to our diplomats."

 greneclyf.13.t:0 "Nimbusia Refuses"
 greneclyf.13.d:0 "The envoy from Nimbusia arrived back home today with the news of complete rejection. Our envoy was rather rudely dismissed and sent back on a Nimbusian ship, as our own ship was seized as a 'gift'."
 greneclyf.13.a:0 "They can't do that! Can they?"

 greneclyf.14.t:0 "A Delegation from Greneclyf"
 greneclyf.14.d:0 "Coming in through the riverways, a group of strange, bug-like ponies called changelings from beyond the coast have arrived to formalise new trading relations between our two people. This would involve an exchange of merchants and goods.\n\nWe have of course heard about their kind before, and while these particular changelings come bearing gifts, might perhaps be all a ruse. Maybe they've managed to fool the other member states that they were friendly, or perhaps these Greneclyfians truly wish to just be friends.\n\nHow should we respond?"
 greneclyf.14.a:0 "They've come a long way, it's only right to accept."
 greneclyf.14.b:0 "Send them back. We don't want anything to do with changelings."

 greneclyf.15.t:0 "Rijekogard Agrees"
 greneclyf.15.d:0 "Rijekogard has accepted our trade deal."
 greneclyf.15.a:0 "We're grateful."

 greneclyf.16.t:0 "Rijekogard Refuses"
 greneclyf.16.d:0 "Rijekogard has refused our trade deal."
 greneclyf.16.a:0 "But... but why?"

 greneclyf.17.t:0 "The bugs of Greneclyf come!"
 greneclyf.17.d:0 "Changelings from the island of Greneclyf arrived earlier this morning with a surprising yet not-so-surprising offer; trade! While nothing out of the ordinary Gerenclyf typically exports iron and textile goods. Reportedly there is a push in their society to open up towards the outside world and abandon their isolationist ways. Perhaps this is a good stepping stone one day Federating with them?"
 greneclyf.17.a:0 "More friends mean more federation targets, yes!"
 greneclyf.17.b:0 "The bugs are too distant and alien to ever be united with, no."

 greneclyf.18.t:0 "Jezeragrad Agrees"
 greneclyf.18.d:0 "Our Envoy returned today from Lake City with joyous news of our offer to trade being accepted whole-heartedly! Though they did speak of working towards a greater Coalition that would one day possibly include us."
 greneclyf.18.a:0 "Did they now? That's something to consider."

 greneclyf.19.t:0 "Jezeragrad Refuses"
 greneclyf.19.d:0 "More bad news from the continent, Lake City rejected our offer to trade. Apparently nothing we had to offer would've impacted their economy much and we're far too distant physically for them to hold any interest in."
 greneclyf.19.a:0 "Well what's that supposed to mean?"

 greneclyf.20.t:0 "Bug Things from Greneclyf"
 greneclyf.20.d:0 "We've recently received an envoy from the islander bug ponies off the coast. Despite all of the myths about these creatures as sinister emotion leeches that shapeshift to infiltrate our lives, these supposed creatures approached in their apparently original form. They came with the request for open trade in regard to our gems and other rare mineral stores in exchange for exotic fish, some iron and steel products, along with their own brand of textiles work. Despite how the myths painted these 'bugs', they're rather tiny and unassuming."
 greneclyf.20.a:0 "The little bugs can have their way. It's only trade, after all."
 greneclyf.20.b:0 "Never! They offer nothing valuable enough for our gems!"

 greneclyf.21.t:0 "Diamond Mountain Accepts"
 greneclyf.21.d:0 "Joyous news from one of our many envoys! The Diamond Dogs of, well, Diamond Mountain have accepted our request to open up trade! While reluctant at first, we managed to convince them we'd have something to offer that's worth their vast amount of gems."
 greneclyf.21.a:0 "They're such good people!"

 greneclyf.22.t:0 "Diamond Mountain Refuses"
 greneclyf.22.d:0 "We've received bad news from one of our envoys, the one sent to Diamond Mountain. Apparently they were thrown out and laughed at for what we had to offer."
 greneclyf.22.a:0 "Was it something that we've said?"

 greneclyf.23.t:0 "The Second Expedition"
 greneclyf.23.d:0 "With the success of our first expedition, we shall launch a second trade mission in the hopes of gathering new contacts, new friends, and better trade."
 greneclyf.23.a:0 "Onwards to Equestria!"
 greneclyf.23.b:0 "Let us rekindle with our kind!"

 greneclyf.24.t:0 "Bug Ponies Exist, and They Want to Trade"
 greneclyf.24.d:0 "The countryside has been set aflame with gossip regarding strange new visitors which, for lack of a better word, are bug ponies. They have horns and wings and sound funny too, but most importantly they've come wanting to open up a trade route to great Deponya! We don't necessarily have much to offer outside wheat (which might not even be what these bugs eat) however, they come offering iron, steel, and textile products! This is a good exchange, but then again, they are complete outsiders..."
 greneclyf.24.a:0 "Any who show interest in our lovely nation are surely friends!"
 greneclyf.24.b:0 "They're outsiders that aren't even ponies. They cannot be trusted." 
 
 greneclyf.25.t:0 "Deponya Accepts"
 greneclyf.25.d:0 "Our envoy from the Kingdom of Deponya arrived home today with news of acceptance to open up trade lanes to their country. While we can't expect many merchants from them to arrive, they'll happily accept ours! Though some merchants are concerned that they won't offer much in exchange of what we will offer."
 greneclyf.25.a:0 "Our purpose is to make friends, not money. This is a good thing!"

 greneclyf.26.t:0 "Deponya Refuses"
 greneclyf.26.d:0 "Our envoy to Deponya returned the next day after it was sent out. Apparently, our physical appearance and the fact we're 'outsiders' were reason enough to throw our envoy out. When they tried to reason with them threats were then used that forced our diplomat to retreat."
 greneclyf.26.a:0 "Is the outside world really worth putting up with this?"

 greneclyf.27.t:0 "Magic Wielding Bugs Desire to Trade Knowledge"
 greneclyf.27.d:0 "Curiously enough, strange creatures of myth called changelings have arrived in the capital today. Knowledge of them exists primarily in orally passed down campfire tales of love-draining shapeshifters with sinister intent. While these stories are actually true about them...the ones who've come today have done so in peace. In fact they've shown the utmost respect and have come in their origin form as well. No reports of trouble or other misdeeds either after their arrival...perhaps they're genuine enough. \n\nRegardless the bugs have come with the desire to open up trade routes between Wittenburg and "Greneclyf", their island home. Aside from generic products such as iron, steel, and textiles...the bugs, these 'changelings' have made the interesting offer to exchange magical knowledge. Apparently the lore of changelings is vastly unknown as...we have no records on it. Perhaps this is a gold mine that has fallen right onto our lap? Then again...we know for sure the true nature of these creatures is naturally malicious. This could easily be nothing more than a show they're putting up to infiltrate our ranks..."
 greneclyf.27.a:0 "Malicious or not, we must know their secrets."
 greneclyf.27.b:0 "No price is enough to open ourselves up to possible parasites like them."

 greneclyf.28.t:0 "Wittenland Accepts"
 greneclyf.28.d:0 "Our envoy arrived back from the intellectual nation of Wittenland with great news. One of the more desired trade partners in our quest for outside contact has agreed to our offer on academic exchange with of course the more petty products in comparison we export."
 greneclyf.28.a:0 "Is it really such a good idea to teach ponies our magic?"
 
 greneclyf.29.t:0 "A Loss of Faith"
 greneclyf.29.d:0 "The reports have been both incessant and disheartening. Many of our trading deals are failing, either by staunch refusal to our offers or by cessation of those accepted by the other parties. These have severely demoralised our people, but none more so than Queen Gytha. Upon hearing word of the latest failure, she lost herself in open despair, affecting a few too close to her. After much struggle, the Queen managed to sober up enough to close herself off in her personal chamber.\n\nShut off from everyone, the Queen has left no one on the seat of power, and no one is sure as to what can be done. As of right now, there is no one to look towards for a sense of stability, and panic is gripping the nation."
 greneclyf.29.a:0 "Sunderer protect us!"

 greneclyf.30.t:0 "The Council of Royals Deliberates"
 greneclyf.30.d:0 "All of the significant members of the Council have convened in Blosmport for the emergency call sent by those closest to the Queen. After several days of intense dialogue and discussion, an urgent matter has to be resolved today, namely what must be done with the Queen.\n\nFor past week Queen Gytha has been absent from nearly all affairs of statehood, after having locked herself in her private chambers, and is refusing to see anyone; not even her closest friends and advisors can reach to the Queen. With no one at the throne, Greneclyf risks collapse if it continues to remain empty. The Queen's House does not have a suitable replacement, and thus the Council's is considering to invoke a vote. Of the many candidates, Princess Oiren of House Aurelia is the prominent and plausible alternative.\n\nBeing the eldest Royal out of all of the suitable candidates —second only to the Queen— Oiren is a far more reserved Royal compared to Gytha, and has championed a more isolationist policy. This would fly in the face of a tradition that has been followed for centuries, and there are a few in the Council openly questioning Oiren's motives. She has insisted that her priorities are for Greneclyf first and foremost, and that her actions are not motivated by her House's ancient rivalry with House Lepidoptera, the Queen's House. Were the Council to invoke the vote, Oiren is certain to win, as all of the other viable candidates pale in comparison to her experience and popularity.\n\nSome of the Council are still hoping for Queen Gytha to recover from whatever is afflicting her, and that she will soon return to bring back at least some semblance of order. House Lepidotpera has ruled continually for centuries, and both its regents and their philosophies have brought us peace and stability. Perhaps the best course for Greneclyf is to wait for the Queen to come back to us."
 greneclyf.30.a:0 "Queen Gytha isn't wholly lost. We trust in a speedy recovery."
 greneclyf.30.b:0 "Gytha is incapable of leading anymore. Let us hold the vote!"

 greneclyf.31.t:0 "The Queen Recovers" 
 greneclyf.31.d:0 "Fortunately for everyone, Queen Gytha has emerged once more from her private quarters and seems to be shockingly rejuvenated altogether after her initial panic attack some time ago. Many feared that she might have become suicidal in her battle against depression, especially after she had begun to refuse to eat.\n\n Such worries can now be safely dismissed, though there are still concerns of her convictions. Most will still follow the Queen, though the certainty from just a few months ago has been replaced by an air of trepidation and anxiousness."

 greneclyf.32.t:0 "What Must be Done with Farbrook"
 greneclyf.32.d:0 "Farbrook has always been a friend to us. However they have shown us that friendship was false. In order to expand our influence, we must first deal with these traitors. But how should we approach this problem?"

They claim that they were a local tradition in Aisling. They're small, rustic buildings, but there was a quality to them that called to me and many other sceptics. Their first Poet Call saw the pews stuffed with the curious and critics, with many filling the empty spaces in between.\n\nThe Praise Poet, a small, frail-looking drone in a beige robe, greeted us all with an open heart and spoke at length, retelling the tale of the Sunderer. It was nothing that we hadn't heard of before, but there was a noticeable tone of devotion in her voice that wasn't present in most retellings.\n\nI could already sense some guilt from some of the other spectators. They evidently hadn't given much thought about just how much changelings owed their existence to the Sunderer, but I, and I suspect most others, still were unmoved by the flowery prose.\n\nThen the Praise Singers sang\n\nThere was no instrumental accompaniment. It was a short poetical hymn that was about as eloquent as the Poet's earlier oration and, when put into writing, wasn't particularly eye-catching.\n\nBut the symphony... it touched my soul. The utter purity of the voices showed a harmonious quality that I had never believed that we shared. This is a part of our identity, and we had chased it away a century back. How could we have done so?\n\nWhen the choral finished, the entire audience was openly crying. My heart, both burdened with remorse but brought to peace by the song, had moved me to sob.  To this, the Praise Poet spoke:\n\n"Take these words ye faithful ones. Out of the dust were we born, and to the dust, we will return. Ye do not yet know the toil that They have made to bring you here, born on this lonely paradise. So They favoured your ancestors to grow in both Body and Mind, making them aware of themselves.

Where do we officially stand on this matter?"

When prodded for further evidence implicating him, we were given a prompt reply of 'he looks like he did it.'\n\nNeedless to say, our citizen insists that he happened to have been wandering nearby when the police had discovered the body of the victim, though so far his pleads of innocence have fallen upon deaf ears.

Now even most of the pro-harmony reformists have lost confidence in our species.\n\nBoth the changeling and the victim were allegedly travelling towards some sort of sacred city for the Nimbusians by the name of Prancetras. Friends of our subject say that he got curious after hearing stories of an oracle who lives there, however, shortly before the changeling reached the city, he encountered the victim, a pegasus citizen. Whatever transpired there ended with a dead pegasus and our subject assuming the identity of the pony he just killed. Of course he was found out soon afterwards and was arrested by the Nimbusian authorities.\n\nThe changeling has sworn that it was in fact the pegasus who attacked him, but testimonies by the victim’s family and friends say the victim was an honourable citizen and a veteran too, making the Nimbusians skeptical towards his testimony. This case is turning into a nightmare for Nimbusian-Greneclyfian relations. Do we believe our citizen’s story or do we back the Nimbusian authorities to save face?"

Through the storm, two monks also traversed the same path as the changeling. When the monks walked past the cave, they saw the changeling’s glowing eyes staring at them. A few seconds later, our citizen was overwhelmed and dragged out of the cave and the monks were shouting at him in an unknown language.\n\nIt turns out our subject ventured into a cave where an evil ‘demon’ was supposedly sealed away. Entering this cave is a grievous offence and extremely suspicious to the pious Pònaidheans. The Taoiseach of Pònaidhean has asked us for our opinion, stating that she is willing to believe this was a misunderstanding, but that letting the changeling go now may mean that the clans in her country vote for restrictions on trade with Greneclyf in the future..."

As he was being judged, orators in major cities repeated the story of the alleged crime, embellishing and adding further heinous acts with each retelling. By the time he was released, none of the Bakarans could believe that the monster that they had continously heard about was set free, and was chased away from the scene.\n\nNeedless to say, we have already sent our official protests to the Bakaran government, though our diplomats there expect little sympathy from it."

The few times that the accused had been seen by his fellow Greneclyfians, it was in a dungeoun under horrendous conditions. What little food was given was woefully inadequate, and the last time a close friend saw him, the jailed changeling was severely emanciated. It is little wonder that he has escaped his confinement in light of the circumstances.\n\nDespite our official condemnation of the defendant's escape, many diamond dogs were left convinced that there was no way that he had managed to do so unaided, and are now eyeing other Greneclyfians with suspicion."

Still, the pegasus attorney delivered a flaming speech arguing that there was absolutely no evidence for the murder, pointing out that his client was unarmed and a weapon was found on the body of the dead pegasus. The lawyer of the victim countered by a gross depiction of stereotypes. The attorney played the crowd and fed their fears of the unknown. Despite no evidence that the changeling was actually guilty, the jury of citizens deemed the evidence substantive enough, referring to our subject as the "insectoid monster."\n\nThe trial continued to the second phase, where both the accused and the accuser got to propose a punishment. The defense attorney, under pressure and cornered by the mood of the crowd, decided to push for banishment, while the attacker pleaded for the death penalty. Thanks to the excellent oration of our lawyer, our citizen narrowly escaped death, with the attorney convincing just enough ponies to let the changeling leave, without his possessions, of course.

With the law system separated by Pònaidhean tribe, the Taoiseach had no choice but to make the changeling a temporary honourary member of her own clan. With that, the framework of laws was set.\n\nOur subject was helpless against the clan elders and the monks who acted as witnesses. Most of the court proceedings happened in a language our citizen couldn’t even understand and nopony offered him legal counsel. The crimes of the changeling were extremely exaggerated by the elders in the end, as they seemed to truly believe that if the monks hadn’t stopped him, the accused would have unleashed a terrible spirit. So, they gave the changeling a sentence of being taken in at a monastery for three years or until he came to repent his demonic past, whichever came later. Without any proper way of defending himself, our subject was dragged off to some forgotten mountaintop, forced into the Pònaidheans’ weird religious institutions."

 greneclyf_crisis.4.d:0 "Ever since the infamous trial of the Greneclyfian changeling, rumours have been spreading about the changelings already present within the whole of the Riverlands. All member races of the Riverlands, both dog and pony, have begun treating them as if they were Chrysalis's changelings: cruel, uncaring and ravenous. These rumours are scaring the population all across the Federation, and relations with the changelings are as of result, rapidly deteriorating. There are already scattered reports of hate crime related atrocities being committed against the Greneclyfians, although these are, thankfully, relatively few and far between as yet.\n\nThere has been no official response from the island nation as of yet, but it will almost certainly be unfavourable."
 greneclyf_crisis.4.a:0 "Our citizens' well-being matters more than the feelings of some bugs'."
 
 greneclyf_crisis.5.t:0 "Rumours Spread about our People"
 greneclyf_crisis.5.d:0 "The trial of one of our own has been noticed throughout the Riverlands. More and more reports are coming in of incidents of flat-out racism against our kind, and more Riverland companies refused cooperation with Greneclyf for reasons we suspect to be because of our race. Our citizens are looking to us for instructions. Some even openly ask if they should give up on friendship with the Riverlands entirely.\n\nFour options are available to us and careful consideration must be made for the safety of our people and our relations with the continentals. We could tell our people to be on guard, although this may make Greneclyfians seem suspicious. We could ask them to be friendlier and patient with those giving them a hard time, to show them our good side. We could also advise our people to consider returning home if they feel threatened, but this may be seen as giving up. Lastly, we could refuse to change course at all."

 greneclyf_crisis.6.t:0 "Greneclyfian Goods Boycotted"
 greneclyf_crisis.6.d:0 "Previously, some of our merchants in the continent had claimed that the Riverlanders were deliberately avoiding to do business with them due to suspected racism. It was a side effect back then, but now people are actively refusing to purchase in our stores abroad. Many of our people have also been refused service in local shops, lending further credence that this is a concentrated effort.\n\nAs a result, our people are reporting losses that will eventually push them out of the markets on the continent. Many of our merchants have called for retaliatory boycotts back at home, even though by all accounts foreign traders have been keeping perfectly fair and legal activities in Greneclyf. Some have suggested to show good will on our part by subsidising our people's purchases of local goods in the continent, whereas others advise to simply help our traders there to recoup their losses.\n\nWhat should we tell our people?"
 greneclyf_crisis.6.a:0 "Help our people to purchase the goods of the locals."

 greneclyf_crisis.7.t:0 "Violent Clashes"
 greneclyf_crisis.7.d:0 "While overall disdain held towards our people has dissipated, there are groups of continentals in certain parts of the Riverlands that actively seek out our people to harrass. These roving bands of thugs have prompted some of our citizens to ignore our previous instructions and actively engage them with their own ad-hoc groups. Fortunately these confrontations haven't caused any deaths, but there has been at least one critical injury so far.\n\nOur representatives have been drowning in protests from the respective governments regarding the behaviour of our changelings, promising dire consequences if the matter isn't addressed promptly and in a satisfactory manner. Our diplomats are looking to us for a formal response."
 greneclyf_crisis.7.a:0 "Their people started it! They share the brunt of the blame!"
 greneclyf_crisis.7.b:0 "Both sides are equally at fault. We'll chastise our own if they chastise theirs."

 greneclyf_crisis.8.t:0 "Greneclyfians Forced to Abandon the Continent"
 greneclyf_crisis.8.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, the continentals couldn't shake free of their preconceived perceptions of us, and have let their fears lash out at our people. They've endured for many weeks, but there has been no end in sight to the prejudice suffered at the hooves of our people. Ships laden with changelings have returned to Greneclyf seeking respite from the terrible treatment abroad. Unfortunately, these same changelings took out their anger at the continentals who willingly came here.\n\nThe recently inaugurated merchant district in Blosmport was mobbed by the returning merchants and adventurers, actively attacking ponies who were only guilty by association. There were no reported deaths from the clashes, but many were injured, some severely, and the entire district was utterly devastated by ransacking and looting.\n\nOnce the news returned on the continent, we were issued an ultimatum by the entire Coalition: leave their lands and never return.\n\nWith no other choice, we had to acquiesce to their demands and end our official relations with a sour note. People in Greneclyf are now seriously questioning the entire endeavour that [Root.GetLeader] had launched into the continent, as well what must be done in order to move forward in the world.\n\nAre we truly without merit in the eyes of the foreigners?"
 greneclyf_crisis.8.a:0 "But... but I did the right thing... didn't I?"

 greneclyf_crisis.9.t:0 "Tensions Fade in the Riverlands"
 greneclyf_crisis.9.d:0 "After punishing the Greneclyfians responsible for inciting violence, there has been a tense if calm period within our communities in the continent. Many of the violent locals have either been arrested by the authorities or have been shamed into submission by the majority of Riverlanders. It appears that we have finally defeated the caricature that had been placed upon us, and have earned if not amiable admiration, at least a grudging respect of our level-headed approach to the troubles that our people have had.\n\nMany natives have admitted shame of their past actions and have asked for forgiveness for their folly and blind fear that they once held. As expected, almost every Greneclyfian has wholeheartedly accepted their apologies and have, in true Greneclyfian spirit, extended a hoof of friendship to those who had wronged them before. While most of our communities are still fairly separated from those of local residents, there are some that are integrating very quickly and very well.\n\nBusiness has returned to normal, and there is nary a sign of trouble ahead for our people. Greneclyfians have finally stepped into the wider world, and we have not been shunned for it."
 greneclyf_crisis.9.a:0 "Harmony among all beings is possible after all."

 greneclyf..t:0 "A Revival of the Old Ways"
 greneclyf..d:0 "Much time has passed with the Queen absent from the affairs of state. While the Council debates what to do, something dark has been taking root in Gytha's mind...\n\nHarmony was supposed to be the path, as it had been for centuries, but it has led us astray. The world refuses to help Greneclyf solely because of their primal fear of changelings. How can a changeling befriend someone who fears them? How can a changeling love someone who hates them? How can Gytha trust Cenhelm if he refuses to help her?\n\nWell, something from deep within the Queen has taken over, and it is ancient.\n\nA new hunger permeates the air wherever Gytha is present, and while she appears to have recovered from her break, there is something hidden behind her fanged smiles and glowing eyes. This is a changeling Royal reborn, and one who has a sole purpose now: protect and feed her Hive, no matter the cost.\n\nDark clouds are gathering on the isle, and they threaten to billow forth unto the continent."
 greneclyf..a:0 "If it's monsters they want..."

 greneclyf..t:0 "Together Once More"
 greneclyf..d:0 "We have seen the other continent, and while there are many things that are disconcerting about Queen Chrysalis and her subjects, it is ultimately irrelevant — we are bound by biology.\n\nQueen Gytha and Chrysalis have spent much time in private discussing at great lengths as to how their respective nations can work better together moving forwards. At first, those closest to Gytha told of her adamantly frustrated by their ideological differences. Something has changed recently, however; the Greneclyfian Royal is no longer as approachable as she had been, and many wonder what could have brought about this change.\n\nRegardless, this shift has coincided with a breakthrough in the Royals' private negotiations. Greneclyf will serve as a faithful ally to our kin from across the sea, bound by the blood of our kind. Some still wonder if this new Queen Gytha will be prepared for this challenge, however..."
 greneclyf..a:0 "§GQueen Chrysalis was very convincing.§!"

 greneclyf..t:0 "A Frank Talk Between Queens"
 greneclyf..d:0 "Many trembled in fear when they saw their queen's furious response to Chrysalis's challenge. While her erstwhile intent was to arrest Chrysalis, Queen Gytha instead decided to try to finally stamp out Chrysalis's ideals. Long hours passed after that first confrontation, leaving many waiting with bated breath for the outcome. Surprisingly enough, a seemingly humbled Chrysalis accompanied Gytha to be shown the errors of her ways.\n\n"No more lying, no more scheming," said the Queen. "Chrysalis's goals are united with Our own."\n\nSo with the two Royals finally in agreement, Greneclyf appears prepared to finally tackle the question of how to proceed in light of the great nations refusing our offers of peace and love. One thing is for certain though: Chrysalis shall work with Gytha as a close advisor."

The blindfold, symbolising the perceived desire of non-changelings not to speak with Greneclyfians, has become synonymous with the stewing resentment among the populace.\n\nThe growing radicalisation of the movement has shaken faith in the Leamhan approach of governance and foreign policy, and we've seen political support waning. We can expect this to continue if the people's call for a governmental response to Dairile's question that she posed sixty years ago.

 NCH_gw_tank_equipment_desc:0 "Armoured vehicles weren't an unheard-of idea on Greneclyf for many decades, often capturing the minds of fantasy writers and eccentric engineers. The Mótarcanóin Ilraoin (all-terrain motorized cannon carriage) was the first genuine attempt to make it a reality.  Its original design was to have two pairs of mountable arms that would give the vehicle unparalleled manoeuvrability over uneven terrain. The design was pushed back considerably due to its overcomplicated arms and weak engine. As such, only a few prototypes of the Mótarcanóin without the arms were ever built."

 NCH_heavy_tank_equipment_1:0 "BnG Tanc Coisithe C.1 'Dúnán'"
 NCH_heavy_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Following military wisdom at the time, the National Tank Bureau worked to create an infantry tank that was specifically designed to break through strongpoints. The 'Dúnán' was drawn up to be well-armed and armoured, though even the most optimist estimates concluded that its speed would rarely reach that of a typical marching pace. Due to this shortcoming, the tank was armed with additional machineguns to deter attacks from enemy infantry."

 NCH_heavy_tank_equipment_2:0 "Panzerkampfwagen VI Tiger"
 NCH_heavy_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Tiger I was a Changeling heavy tank developed in 1012 as an answer to the unexpectedly impressive Stalliongradian armour encountered in the initial months of the Changeling invasion of the Equestria, particularly the T-34 and the KV-1."

 NCH_heavy_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Known under the informal name Königstiger but, often semi-literally translated as the King Tiger by Equestrian soldiers, the design followed the same concept as the Tiger I, but was intended to be even more formidable. The Tiger II combined the thick armour of the Tiger I with the sloped armour used on the Panther medium tank. The tank weighed almost seventy metric tons, was protected by 100 to 180mm of armour to the front and was armed with the long barrelled 8.8 cm Kampfwagenkanone 43 L/71 gun."

 NCH_light_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Designed alongside the Dúnán following infantry/cavalry tank doctrine, the 'Dornálai' had a longer development cycle due to disagreements among engineers. The main point of contention was the addition of a secondary machinegun armament in the hull, that was eventually included to keep the tank's firepower competitive. Though its armaments were still considered inferior compared to those of foreign analogues, the tank proved to be a favourite by its crews due to its speed and general reliability."

 NCH_light_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "Combat experience on the continent brought to bear the inadequacies of the military thinking regarding the role of tanks. What ensued was a rushed development multiple modern designs that would better suit the conditions of battle. The 'Broc-chú' was the sixth plan accepted after many delays in designing a suitably light chassis. Though plagued by gearbox issues, the low profile and 37mm gun made it a significant threat to other similarly-armed enemies."

It was planned to arm the vehicle with the 75mm Kwk 41, although that was changed to a smaller 50mm cannon. The VK 1602 had sloped frontal armour, influenced by the Panther medium tank. In order to increase cross-country performance, the VK 1602 was fitted with 350mm wide tracks."

 NCH_medium_tank_artillery_equipment_1_desc:0 "Following the development of the SPG redesign of the 'Curadh', the Greneclyfian military had a suitable platform for an armoured assault gun carrier. Though the open-air gunshield rendered the crew vulnerable to small-arms fire, it also allowed multiple upgrades to its armament, culminating to the 'Lannaire', carrying a 100mm gun that performed well in its frontline combat role."

 NCH_medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_1_desc:0 "The poor gun performance of the 'Curadh' and lack of suitable alternatives forced the National Tank Bureau to enact a stopgap solution: the conversion of several Curadhs into SPGs. By reworking the driveshaft and removing the turret for an open-topped gunshield mounting, the chassis allowed for large-calibre cannons. The anti-tank variant was designated as the 'Lansaí'. Though the low profile and gun made the TD a dangerous foe, its combat effectiveness was hampered by rounds that underperformed."

 NCH_medium_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Inspired by the designs of Stalliongradian medium tanks, the 'Combat Tank' series was meant to replace the infantry and cavalry tanks from before. However, due to reduced production conditions, the 'Curadh' had an inordinately long developmental process before the first models were rolling out of the factories. Though not meeting the expectations set by the army, they approved the design and placed a modest order of 100 tanks. Upgunned twice, the 'Curadh' was still considered inadequate when facing its contemporaries in late 1013."

 NCH_medium_tank_equipment_2:0 "Panzerkampfwagen IV"
 NCH_medium_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "Designed as an infantry-support tank, the Panzer IV was not originally intended to engage enemy armour - that function was performed by the lighter Panzer III. However, with the flaws of pre-war doctrine becoming apparent and in the face of Stalliongradian T-34 tanks, the Panzer IV soon assumed the tank-fighting role of its increasingly obsolete cousin. The most widely manufactured and deployed Changeling tank, the Panzer IV was used as the base for many other fighting vehicles."

 NCH_medium_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Panther is the common name of a medium tank deployed by Changelings from mid-1014. It was intended as a counter to the Stalliongradian T-34, and as a replacement for the Panzer III and Panzer IV. While never replacing the latter, it served alongside the heavier Tiger tank. The Panther's excellent combination of firepower, mobility, and protection served as a benchmark for other nations' late war and post-war tank designs, and it is regarded as one of the best tanks ever created."

 smugbugfug_desc:0 "§gGarran of Clann Leamhan is a fairly young changeling  general from the Blosmport Academy, member of the new generation of officers and thrust in this position thanks to his noble lineage. Passionate about the multitude of intelligent species that inhabit this world, Garran spend most of his free time studying and interacting with them, wishing to know everything about their biological and psychological functioning and sincerely appreciating their presence.\n\nOf a talkative nature and benefitting from the education of a noble family, his fondness for the other species makes Garran a pleasant and tolerant companion. However, due to his military career he does not hesitate to use his knowledge on the battlefield to infiltrate, deceive and manipulate his enemies to his advantage, cruelly manipulating their minds as much as possible and encouraging his staff to do the same. Despite his kind nature during  peace time, some may accuse him to be a twisted mind trickster.§!"

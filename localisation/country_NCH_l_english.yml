 NCH_assess_the_situation:0 "Addressing the Dairile Movement"
 NCH_assess_the_situation_desc:0 "Rising tensions among our people with the continentals have permeated in most of our society, and are disrupting Greneclyfian life. We must convene the Council of Royals to deliberate the best course of action for our country if we are to save it."

 NCH_meet_the_continent:0 "Preparing for the Continent"
 NCH_meet_the_continent_desc:0 "The Royals have spoken, and they all agree; we must mount several expeditions to the world beyond to gain a better relationship with the continentals. We shall prepare the necessary diplomats and means immediately."

 NCH_our_old_friends:0 "Our Old Friends"
 NCH_our_old_friends_desc:0 "Farbrook has long stood by us through thick and thin. Our expedition to Farbrook is mostly to help establish a presence on the continent in a safe harbour, though we do intend to expand our current relationships. These negotiations with Farbrook should be nothing more than a formality."
 
 NCH_trade_diamond_dogs:0 "The Dogs of Diamond Mountain"
 NCH_trade_diamond_dogs_desc:0 "We have seldom interacted with the canids on the continent, but they are the first step in meeting and communicating some of the other, more belligerent species present. It won't be easy to get the Diamond Dogs to agree to our terms, but our diplomats are confident in success."
 
 NCH_trade_bakara:0 "The Sailors of Bakara"
 NCH_trade_bakara_desc:0 "Bakarian ships are nothing too out of the ordinary in our waters, but we have never truly opened former communications with Bakara. They are a naval power that we ought to begin a friendly relationship with if we have any intention to open ourselves to the world."

 NCH_trade_nimbusia:0 "The Pegasi of Nimbusi"
 NCH_trade_nimbusia_desc:0 "The tales of ancient Nimbusia have been in the collective memory of Greneclyfians for a long time, and the prospect of encountering the Nimbusians has some diplomats on edge. They are still the military arm of the River Coalition, and we must make a good impression at Nimbusi if we're to have a chance in the Coalition."
 
 NCH_trade_ponaidhean:0 "The Tribes of Pònaidhean" 
 NCH_trade_ponaidhean_desc:0 "In many respects, the ponies of Pònaidhean are close to our way of life. Their connection and adherence to the principles of harmony and friendship are indicative of a wise people, and we would be remiss not to approach the Taoiseach Coalition with a friendly hoof. We can share our pearls of wisdom so that we both can become something greater."

 NCH_trade_deponya:0 "The Traditionalists of Buckbanburg"
 NCH_trade_deponya_desc:0 "Much like us, Deponyans have found themselves mostly closed off to the world and, if our reports are correct, are at risk of being left behind by the changes of modernity. Deponya is steeped in old views of the world, and will likely be challenging to get a positive response from them. However, if we can make friends with Deponyans, there would be little to stop us."

 NCH_trade_river_republic:0 "The Riverlanders of Rijekograd"
 NCH_trade_river_republic_desc:0 "The River Republic is decidedly the heart and unifying will of the River Coalition. Any hope for possible integration into the wider world stage lies in convincing the ponies of Rijekograd of our good intentions. Once assured, any further efforts will undoubtedly receive the Republic's support."
 
 NCH_trade_wittenland:0 "The Unicorns of Wittenburgh" 
 NCH_trade_wittenland_desc:0 "Wittenland is a land of unicorns with a deep understanding of magic and, by some reports, deep pockets. Some might question our motivation in seeking monetary support from the wealthy monarchy, but both it and the intention of sharing knowledge in magic are true. We only aim to engage in the discussion of magic and to stimulate both of our economies."

 NCH_trade_lake_city:0 "The Guardians of Jezeragrad"
 NCH_trade_lake_city_desc:0 "The Jezeragrad Republic has languished, and its people require help keeping check of the aggressive griffons to the west and south. Though they may have friends from the Coltstream Treaty, Lake City will graciously welcome another friend. Should the worst come to pass, we will show the world that we shall no longer sit idly by when evil threatens peace."

 NCH_convene_the_council_desc:0 "With the Queen refusing to see anyone, the Council of Royals must meet to try and resolve the gap that Gytha has left in her absence.\n\nPerhaps a new Queen is in order?"

 NCH_a_new_path:0 "A New Path"
 NCH_a_new_path_desc:0 "It's clear that Gytha's way is no longer viable for the prolonged survival of the Hive. We must now seriously reconsider our traditions and way of life if we are to survive in this uncertain world."

 NCH_the_old_ways_desc:0 "Greneclyfians everywhere are still reeling from the rejection of the ponies on the continent. The Leamhan philosophy has been soundly discredited, and our way of life has been put into question. Perhaps, delving deep into our people's history, we shall uncover an answer to our dilemma?"

They've however been raised to resist the urge to use these powers for ill intents. After what has happened, however, we must recognise this strength and stop treating it as a weakness. It is a gift, not a curse!"
 
 NCH_infiltrator_network:0 "Infiltrate The Hillponies"
 NCH_infiltrator_network_desc:0 "Before, when we could call the Hillponies of Farbrook friends, we merely visited their lands. If we genuinely wish to learn about the greater world, we must put our gift to good use and mingle among the continentals.\n\nWe shall return, not as friends, but as rivals."
 
 NCH_expand_the_networks:0 "Expand the Networks"
 NCH_expand_the_networks_desc:0 "We've learned much about the Hillponies, and we were almost shocked to find that they are a split people vulnerable to attack. Perhaps now that we know better, we can study those who'd chase us from the continent. The Riverlands are more advanced and must be carefully observed if we're to find any weaknesses to exploit."
 
 NCH_scientific_development:0 "Ré an Réasúin"

 NCH_clan_oiren_generals:0 "Bringing Back the Deoraithe"
 NCH_clan_oiren_generals_desc:0 "Long ago, members of Clann Óir had once been banished to the deep forests and hills of Aisling because of their unique interpretations of history. What remains of the Exiled are a surprisingly hardy and cunning folk that any Leamhan would have considered barbaric. In such times, however, we can resolve our differences and bring them back into the fold."
 
 NCH_oiren_crusaders:0 "An Cine Tofa"
 NCH_oiren_crusaders_desc:0 "Changelings are the product of the Great Hatcher Below, the first and only emotivores of the world. Others call us parasites, but if left to our own devices, we can easily dominate any sentient creature. We must take this fact to heart, and realise that the Sunderer's sacrifice would be for nought if we do not assert ourselves as we were created to. For we are the Chosen People."
 
 NCH_holy_factories:0 "Oibrithe Dílse"
 NCH_holy_factories_desc:0 "There is a natural order to all things, and the changeling castes are no different. The Drones are and will always be subordinate to the Royals. All that needs to be done is to ensure their loyalty and efficiency, no matter their trade or position."
 
 NCH_warrior_traditions:0 "The Modern Changeling"
 NCH_warrior_traditions_desc:0 "Much time has been devoted to reconciling with the Deoraithe and ourselves. Our histories are once more aligned, and we are united in thought. There is much work left to be done if we're to be counted among the great, but we've shaken off the inane notions of pacifism that shackled our strengths. The Modern Greneclyfian has finally arrived to make her mark upon the world."
 
 NCH_fascist_education:0 "Teach The People"

 NCH_memories_of_the_homeland:0 "Stoke the Memories of Tír Dhúchais"
 NCH_memories_of_the_homeland_desc:0 "Vague tales recall of a time where changelings once lived on the continent. We may have been content living on our home isle of Greneclyf, but that changes today. Studies of ancient tales and scripts can help us delineate a continental territory where we once used to live... and where we shall return to."
 
 NCH_lead_the_armies:0 "Lead The Armies"
 NCH_lead_the_armies_desc:0 "The time has come. When we came upon these shores in the past, we came bearing gifts and offered our hearts.

 ### MILITARY BRANCH ###

 NCH_reorganize_the_army:0 "Reorganising the Army"
 NCH_reorganize_the_army_desc:0 "For time immemorial, there has been no 'standing army' in Greneclyf. The closest thing to it has been the Household Guard. Being the only professional soldiers, the drones-at-arms typically levied by the many Clanns simply do not compare. We must take immediate steps to reform our military thinking and our methods."

 NCH_form_a_dedicated_officer_corps:0 "Form a Dedicated Officer Corps"
 NCH_form_a_dedicated_officer_corps_desc:0 "Traditionally, military officers are exclusively Royals who have shown an affinity towards the command of units and soldiers. While this may ensure a pool of competent leaders, its size is limited by the number of possible candidates. Offering a military education as well as allowing the enrollment of Drones will expand that pool, and form a standard to which all future commanders will adhere to."

 NCH_the_industrial_question:0 "The Logistics Question"
 NCH_the_industrial_question_desc:0 "Modern land warfare requires an infrastructure of logistics on a scale previously unseen in Greneclyf, and it necessitates dedicated batallions solely responsible for maintaining lines of communication and supplies to keep our forces fighting for longer. As such, steps must be taken for to form such batallions, as well as the industrial capacity to supply the necessary supplies."

 NCH_purchase_production_licenses:0 "Purchase Production Licenses"
 NCH_purchase_production_licenses_desc:0 "Greneclyf has little experience with the use modern weapons, even less so with the production of them and their munitions. No matter what we do, any native designs will simply not compare to those of foreign designs. While we set aside the necessary funds to set up the necessary industries, we must search for weapon and equipment deals abroad."

 NCH_domestic_arms_factories:0 "Domestic Arms Factories"
 NCH_domestic_arms_factories_desc:0 "Our people have been fairly self-sufficient, so why should our weapons and military equipment industries be any different? Everything that we use should be of Greneclyfian origin. As we are searching for new designs domestically, Greneclyf must immediately begin a massive construction programme to be the foundation of our industries."

 NCH_limited_expansion:0 "Limited Expansion"
 NCH_limited_expansion_desc:0 "We mustn't upset the current environment with the expansion of our current guilds and workshops. Our crafters and metalworkers must be allowed to adapt to the new requirements and tools, lest we bring about unrest among the guilds."

 NCH_give_more_funds:0 "Offer More Funds"
 NCH_give_more_funds_desc:0 "Greneclyf must do everything to catapult our idustries forwards, no matter how sudden it may appear to our workers. To placate any qualms that they may have, we'll appropriate the necessary funds and capital."

 NCH_modern_firearms:0 "Reichswaffen Rifles"
 NCH_modern_firearms_desc:0 "The Reichswaffen Company in the Griffon Empire has made massive waves in the armaments industry, of which even we have felt. Our experts have experimented with their rifles, and have deemed them to be the best from the continent. Let us send a formal offer to their company to establish a cooperative enterprise on our isle."

 NCH_modern_artillery:0 "Greda Guns"
 NCH_modern_artillery_desc:0 "Wingbardy's heavy weapons have long been renowned for their efficacy, and many have called their artillery the most fearsome on the continent. Greda is an old cannon designer, and they may be willing to share their designs with us if we make a good enough offer."

 NCH_automotives:0 "Freemare Automotives"
 NCH_automotives_desc:0 "The pony enclave of New Mareland to the south-west has inherited a strong automotive tradition from Equestria, and it is home to the Freemare Automotive company. Following an economic depression, they may be looking for new business opportunities; let us offer them one that they can't refuse."

 NCH_armoured_vehicles:0 "KLAA Prototypes"
 NCH_armoured_vehicles_desc:0 "The Changeling Lands are at the cutting edge of armour development, and it would be remiss of us to not approach one of their famed designer companies for some of their armoured behemoths. Perhaps they may even be willing to set up a mutual company on Greneclyf dedicated to the develompent of tanks."
 
 NCH_inf_weapons:0 "Lochainn Loadaid"
 NCH_inf_weapons_desc:0 "Our smithies are renowned for their steel weapons, and are thus the best candidate to expand their expertise into firearms. They shall be aggregated into the Lochainn Loadaid na nGaibhaire, and offered the tools and funds to begin work on our homegrown firearms."
 
 NCH_heavy_weapons:0 "Airtléire na nGreneclyf"
 NCH_heavy_weapons_desc:0 "Perhaps less radical of an idea than a hoof-held firearm, bombards and cannons have nevertheless not been part of Greneclyfian combined arms. We must set up the appropriate smithies and ironworks to be placed under a single entity solely dedicated to the production of these mighty weapons. Only then will artillery become a permament fixture of the Greneclyfian army."
 
 NCH_automotive_industry:0 "Biúró na nGluaisteán"
 NCH_automotive_industry_desc:0 "Machines and the production of their parts is a wholly new field of manufacturing that must be built from the ground up if we are ever to compete with the equivalent industries of other nations. Difficult as it is, we ought to focus on motorising our society, rather than producing machines solely dedicated for war."
 
 NCH_tank_investments:0 "The Greneclyfian Tanc"
 NCH_tank_investments_desc:0 "Automotives have their place in war, but armoured fighting vehicles have shown to be decisive tools in war and force multipliers. The 'tanc' should be prioritised, lest we be left at a grievous disadvantage when battling superiour forces."
 
 NCH_continue_the_purchases:0 "Extend the Lincenses"
 NCH_continue_the_purchases_desc:0 "Our production licenses have proven to be a success, and there is little reason to not build upon them. Following the foreign designs may prove difficult to replicate, but will be on par with those of any potential foe."

 NCH_end_the_deals:0 "Terminate the Licenses"
 NCH_end_the_deals_desc:0 "We have learned what we could from the strangers, so we should consider adapting what we've purchased to suit our industrial capacity. More modern designs will come by more slowly without direct support from the foreign experts, but it is time for us to start producing purely native designs."

 NCH_tighten_conscription_regulations:0 "Tighten Conscription Regulations"
 NCH_tighten_conscription_regulations_desc:0 "There is a reason why only the best were recruited into the Household Guard of old, and while we may loosen some of the more stringent requirements for enrollment into the Guard itself, we should still be looking for the best to form our file and rank."

 NCH_call_to_arms:0 "Call to Arms"
 NCH_call_to_arms_desc:0 "We are few in numbers, and a fight with the throngs of griffons and ponies would easily overwhelm our forces. While Greneclyf will never match its foes number for number, we should do our best to close that numerical gap, even if it comes at the cost of enrolling lesser recruits."

 NCH_perfected_planning:0 "Perfect Planning"
 NCH_perfected_planning_desc:0 "Our people can only offer so many soldiers, so we should not needlessly squander them. We can avoid useless losses by having a doctrinal goal at every level of the army: from the tactical to the strategic, every move will be done according to a grand plan."

 NCH_infiltrators:0 "Infiltrator Companies"
 NCH_infiltrators_desc:0 "War is not fair, much as we may wish it were otherwise. As such, we must use every possible advantage that we have to build towards victory, even if it may put into question what it means to be a Greneclyfian."

 NCH_the_greneclyfian_jager:0 "The Greneclyfian Jager"
 NCH_the_greneclyfian_jager_desc:0 "Geamhraich are traditionally Greneclyfians who have taken to a quasi-isolated life in the hills in Aisling, where the winters and wildlife are harsh. Their ways and environments could prove useful to train specialised infantry dedicated to fight in inhospitable conditions."

 ### AIR BRANCH ###

 NCH_rethinking_aerial_warfare:0 "Rethinking Aerial Warfare"
 NCH_rethinking_aerial_warfare_desc:0 "By all accounts we've always had a sort of 'air force' in the sense of high flying drones that serve as battlefield disrupters. But in this modern age of warfare exist flying machines that can be equipped with fully automatic weapons—far larger than anything a single drone could carry, much less fly with. In order to have a properly modern military, we'll need to dive into this brand new field of military science."

 NCH_rock_mountain_base:0 "Bugsmere Air Base"
 NCH_rock_mountain_base_desc:0 "Much like the ancient city-hive of Bugsmere, the innards of the mountains will shelter our main air base. Conventional wisdom may say that the best location would be open terrain, but if war is to come to Greneclyf, a protected base of aerial operations will prove a challenging target for any enemy."

 NCH_aerial_experiments:0 "Aerial Experiments"
 NCH_aerial_experiments_desc:0 "We know ourselves best, so we are best positioned to make aircraft designed around ourselves. Native designs may perhaps not perform as well compared to foreign crafts, but will be simpler to produce en masse."

 NCH_search_for_foreign_designs:0 "Search for Foreign Designs"
 NCH_search_for_foreign_designs_desc:0 "None of our craftsworkers have ever even conceived of a flying craft, so whatever design they could come up with would never be on par with those of more modern nations. It is perhaps better to acquiesce to the costly designs for better perfoming aircraft."

 NCH_flight_schools:0 "Flight Schools"
 NCH_flight_schools_desc:0 "Aside from actually having aircraft to use, we'll need changelings suited to pilot them as well. Unlike regular army work, being a pilot requires a whole different set of talents such as good eyesight, quick reactions, and a strong stomach. By propping up schools dedicated purely to squeezing out the best pilots from our population, we'll know that our aircraft are in good hooves."

 NCH_foreign_pilots:0 "Foreign Instructors"
 NCH_foreign_pilots_desc:0 "We have the planes, but being of non-Greneclyfian design, no changeling is best qualified to teach our pilots how to fly them. As such, we will need to recruit suitably experienced instructors from abroad so that our pilots can fly their planes as if they were merely an extension of themselves."
 
 NCH_sound_designs:0 "Sound Designs"
 NCH_sound_designs_desc:0 "Aircraft are still a young art of engineering, as such there is no reason to go crazy and dive into strange fields. What's been tried and tested thus far is what we should stick with; leave the experimentation to the Industrial Giants of the far West who actually have the resources to meddle in such things."

 NCH_radical_designs:0 "Radical Designs"
 NCH_radical_designs_desc:0 "We lack the industry to mass produce aircraft and the population to continually sustain a fleet of them. Our only choice is to fight brawn with brain and push our models to their very limit. There is no doubt that our airdrones will be outnumbered in the air, so they'll need every possible advantage against the opposition's own dogfighters."


 ### NAVY BRANCH ###

 NCH_an_admiralty:0 "An Admiralty"
 NCH_an_admiralty_desc:0 "Being an island nation, Greneclyf will need to build up a maritime force. Before we can start however, we must have a structure with a dedicated naval corps of officers and theoriticians to get us started."

 NCH_support_admiral_petiole:0 "Support Admiral Fallon's Plan"
 NCH_support_admiral_petiole_desc:0 "Changelings have the innate talent for subterfuge, and while its use in greater society can be discussed at length, Fallon's plan for the seas applies that same philosophy to our vessels. Instead of the traditional surface ship, our main naval force should be underwater boats that can avoid detection and strike from below. Submarine warfare may be unorthodox, but it is both efficient and effective."

 NCH_go_all_in:0 "Accept Admiral Poethgils's Petition"
 NCH_go_all_in_desc:0 "Adapting our navy to modern warfare will not be enough, and Admiral Poethgils's petition goes into great technical detail on how Greneclyf can do better. He envisions the largest warship to have ever sailed the seas, based off of the great ships produced by Skyfall's naval yards, but larger, with more guns and armour. It will be a costly endeavour, but an unsinkable ship may very well be worth it."

 NCH_found_the_naval_academy:0 "Found the Naval Academy"
 NCH_found_the_naval_academy_desc:0 "Our initial drive for naval officers has produced some results, but it is clear that there must be an institution to ensure that Greneclyf will continue to produce great officers to serve their nations. Using the expertise of our current Admiralty, we can form an official naval academy for just that purpose."

 NCH_expand_the_naval_yards:0 "Expand the Naval Yards"
 NCH_expand_the_naval_yards_desc:0 "The current state of shipyards in Blosmport and other port settlements do not allow for the production of anything more than commercial vessels. If Greneclyf is to become a regional naval power, it must have the capacity to build its own new military vessels."

 NCH_proficient_packs:0 "The Icewaters Sharks"
 NCH_proficient_packs_desc:0 "The life of a submariner is stressful, especially when untrained and unprepared for wartime conditions. New plans put forward by Admiral Farris would designate parts of our territorial waters for use solely by the navy for war games and exercises. War may be the only true way to prepare our sailours for the hardships of war, but this is the next best alternative."

 NCH_lay_down_the_hatcher:0 "Lay Down the Hatcher"
 NCH_lay_down_the_hatcher_desc:0 "The designs have all been approved by naval engineers; the first Hatcher class is ready to be laid down in our shipyards. Soon, Greneclyf shall field the greatest and largest ship that the world will ever see!"

 NCH_torpedo_boats:0 "Torpedo Boats"
 NCH_torpedo_boats_desc:0 "Torpedoes have been used by Greneclyfian ships to protect themselves from pirates before cannons, and even powerful torpedoes don't require a large vessel to be effective. While large warships with great cannons have their place, smaller torpedo boats will prove just as deadly."

 NCH_the_mayfly_class:0 "The Mayfly Line"
 NCH_the_mayfly_class_desc:0 "A modern navy requires flexibility, and cruisers offer a great compromise between the heavy-hitting capacity of larger capital ships and the nimble speed of smaller destroyers. Whether light or armoured, our cruisers shall fill a number of roles that will prove invaluable in a future naval conflict."

 NCH_protected_cruisers:0 "The Borer Class"
 NCH_protected_cruisers_desc:0 "A hard look at Greneclyf's naval industry exposes an inconvenient truth: great battleships are both costly and take an exceedingly long amount of time to build. While we might never produce more than a few battleships, battlecruisers bring similair firepower for considerably cheaper. These shall be the mainstay ships of our nation."

 greneclyf_trade.2.t:0 "Preparations for the Great Expedition"
 greneclyf_trade.2.d:0 "It is clear that Greneclyf must put it's best hoof forwards in the coming days if we are ever going to extend our influence beyond our island and Farbrook. As such, there is much to worry about: logistics, routes, ships, and volunteers. Without these, we will not go far, so nothing must be left to chance.\n\nThese preparations will take time, but they are necessary to ensure that nothing will go wrong."
 greneclyf_trade.2.a:0 "There is much work to do."

 greneclyf_trade.3.t:0 "The Start of the Great Expeditions"
 greneclyf_trade.3.d:0 "The noon sun is shining high in the sky; the ships are all prepared to cast off; the intrepid sailors, cartographers and ambassadors of Greneclyf stand proudly to the ovation of the cheering multitudes; the day has finally arrived.\n\nDelegates from the Royal Houses and Queen Gytha herself are present to see off these brave changelings, and a rousing speech from Gytha moves many in the crowds —and more than a few of the ship crews— to joyful tears. After a lavish ceremony, all eyes were upon the departing vessels as they left port waters.\n\nWe can expect some of them to return within a few weeks, whereas the others will take far longer to bring back a response. Regardless, we will be waiting with for their return with gleeful anticipation."
 greneclyf_trade.3.a:0 "A glorious day!"

 greneclyf_trade.4.t:0 "A Delegation from Greneclyf"
 greneclyf_trade.4.d:0 "A ship from Greneclyf has arrived at Farbrook, filled to the brim with changelings. This in it of itself was strange, as traffic from the isle is usually no more than a few fishing vessels, but the fact that many political and governmental representatives were onboard was telling. Port authorities were immediately approached by these Greneclyfians, requesting an immediate audience with [Root.GetLeader].\n\nThe head delegate, speaking in Queen Gytha's name, has informed us of a shift in Greneclyf's policy regarding the treatment of its citizens over on the continent. Most of their concerns aren't directed to Farbrook itself, however they are asking for a concentrated effort on our path to ensure equal treatment of changelings under the guise of a trade deal, in the hopes to set a friendly tone abroad in the River Coalition.\n\nThough some of the long-term objectives are somewhat ambitious, the short-term goal to enrichen our currently stale trade is a very realistic one, and Farbrookians already consider their Greneclyfian neighbours as equals.\n\nThe Greneclyfian diplomat stands before you, waiting for your response."
 greneclyf_trade.4.a:0 "We shall honour our friends' wishes."
 greneclyf_trade.4.b:0 "Now is not the most opportune time."

 greneclyf_trade.5.t:0 "Farbrook Agrees"
 greneclyf_trade.5.d:0 "One of our ships, the one that was bound for Farbrook, has finally returned to Blosmport. The crew and passengers arrived with the good and expected news of Farbrook's acceptance with our proposal. The wave of renewed travel between Greneclyf and Farbrook is due to begin soon, and our citizens can be expected to be protected as equals. In the meantime, our delegates have been given a hero's welcome."
 greneclyf_trade.5.a:0 "They've earned it."

 greneclyf_trade.6.t:0 "Farbrook Postpones"
 greneclyf_trade.6.d:0 "The ship to Farbrook has returned, but only with a curious message; Chief Cenhelm has abstained from giving a definite answer, and has asked for some more time to consider over our request. Our representative will keep asking for their response, but we can expect one within two months."
 greneclyf_trade.6.a:0 "What is there to think over?"

 greneclyf_trade.7.t:0 "Greneclyf Awaits an Answer"
 greneclyf_trade.7.d:0 "We have done what we could to postpone the question, but the Greneclyfian diplomat has made a final demand: we must give him an answer regarding his request for the protection of Greneclyfian citizens within our borders and of his trade offer. Otherwise, he will take our silence as a refusal.\n\nWhat shall be our official response?"
 greneclyf_trade.7.a:0 "We shall honour our friends' wishes."
 greneclyf_trade.7.b:0 "We can't accept this."
 greneclyf_trade.7.c:0 "Send them home. They are no longer welcome."

 greneclyf_trade.8.t:0 "Farbrook Refuses"
 greneclyf_trade.8.d:0 "The ship to Farbrook has finally returned, though with bad news. Despite our efforts, Farbrook has refused our request. In addition, while it wasn't explicitely stated, we can assume that the Great Pacts are no longer in effect, and that our friendship has ended."
 greneclyf_trade.8.a:0 "But... but why?"

 greneclyf_trade.9.t:0 "Farbrook Breaks off Relations"
 greneclyf_trade.9.d:0 "We have finally gotten word back from Farbrook, but a stunned diplomat has returned to tell us of an utter cessation of all ties, official or otherwise, between our nations. The news have spread quickly, and a general sense of sorrow has gripped the hearts of many of our people, as many have friends over in Farbrook.\n\nThe Queen has done her best to calm down the populace, but despite her insistence otherwise, she too has suffered from the loss of her own relationship."
 greneclyf_trade.9.a:0 "Have they lost their minds?!"

 greneclyf_trade.10.t:0 "Changelings Wish to Trade"
 greneclyf_trade.10.d:0 "Greneclyfian changelings, ancient creatures capable of shapeshifting and emotivores, arrived upon our shores with the both an offer and a request. Hailing from the island to our North-West, these insectoid ponies have come with urgent request to open up trade routes as part of a national effort to promote Harmonic elements in their society. In addition, they wish to for the Greneclyfians already residing within our lands to be protected from discrimination. \n\nOn the one hoof, they're changelings who shouldn't be trusted, as per the old mares' tales, especially due to their naval build-up from years prior. On the other hoof, we have had any incidents with those currently residing in Bakara, and their navy is obsolete and no real threat to ours.\n\nWe could garner some good trade from Greneclyf while promising their citizens the same protections as of those given to our own."
 greneclyf_trade.10.a:0 "Our Republic protects all within our borders. We agree."
 greneclyf_trade.10.b:0 "Changelings are creatures of subterfuge! Protect them, and we'd scuttle our nation!"

 greneclyf_trade.11.t:0 "Bakara Agrees"
 greneclyf_trade.11.d:0 "Our envoy to Bakara returned home today with news of acceptance. While reluctant at first, our envoy had to answer a long series of questions in regard to our citizens, their habits, and of our rapid naval build-up. Once their fears were aptly dispelled, we were promised both a normalisation of trade and of the well-treatment of our citizens."
 greneclyf_trade.11.a:0 "Expertly done by our delegate!"

 greneclyf_trade.12.t:0 "Bakara Refuses"
 greneclyf_trade.12.d:0 "Our envoy to Bakara returned home today to give the unfortunate news of rejection. Despite our earnest attempts to sway them, the leadership there refused to agree to our requests. Among their grievances was their concern about our previous naval build-up which they believe that was meant to threaten their naval dominance. Our envoy's dismissal was curt as it was blunt."
 greneclyf_trade.12.a:0 "Queen Bairbre's folly still haunts us..."

 greneclyf_trade.13.t:0 "A Delegation of Bugs"
 greneclyf_trade.13.d:0 "Some sudden news came today in the form of ships hoisting a flag of unknown origin landing in port under the guise of peace. Aboard these weaponless convoys were the changelings of Greneclyf. This is not our first encounter of these creatures, and we have seen their ilk among Nimbusia. They came offering iron and steel along with their own brand of textile products in exchange for our own goods. They seem harmless enough..."
 greneclyf_trade.13.a:0 "They're completely harmless, and Nimbusia could always have more friends than enemies."
 greneclyf_trade.13.b:0 "They're pitiful and weak. They can buy their safety with their ship."

 greneclyf_trade.14.t:0 "Nimbusia Agrees"
 greneclyf_trade.14.d:0 "Our diplomatic envoy to Nimbusia has returned with the good news! Nimbusian merchants should be arriving in Greneclyf anytime within the coming weeks and we're free to trade with the pegasi of Nimbusia!"
 greneclyf_trade.14.a:0 "Send our thanks to our diplomats."

 greneclyf_trade.15.t:0 "Nimbusia Refuses"
 greneclyf_trade.15.d:0 "The envoy from Nimbusia arrived back home today with the news of complete rejection. Our envoy was rather rudely dismissed and sent back on a Nimbusian ship, as our own ship was seized as a 'gift'."
 greneclyf_trade.15.a:0 "They can't do that! Can they?"

 greneclyf_trade.16.t:0 "A Delegation from Greneclyf"
 greneclyf_trade.16.d:0 "Coming in through the riverways, a group of strange, bug-like ponies called changelings from beyond the coast have arrived to formalise new trading relations between our two people. This would involve an exchange of merchants and goods.\n\nWe have of course heard about their kind before, and while these particular changelings come bearing gifts, might perhaps be all a ruse. Maybe they've managed to fool the other member states that they were friendly, or perhaps these Greneclyfians truly wish to just be friends.\n\nHow should we respond?"
 greneclyf_trade.16.a:0 "They've come a long way, it's only right to accept."
 greneclyf_trade.16.b:0 "Send them back. We don't want anything to do with changelings."

 greneclyf_trade.17.t:0 "Rijekogard Agrees"
 greneclyf_trade.17.d:0 "Rijekogard has accepted our trade deal."
 greneclyf_trade.17.a:0 "We're grateful."

 greneclyf_trade.18.t:0 "Rijekogard Refuses"
 greneclyf_trade.18.d:0 "Rijekogard has refused our trade deal."
 greneclyf_trade.18.a:0 "But... but why?"

 greneclyf_trade.19.t:0 "The bugs of Greneclyf come!"
 greneclyf_trade.19.d:0 "Changelings from the island of Greneclyf arrived earlier this morning with a surprising yet not-so-surprising offer; trade! While nothing out of the ordinary Gerenclyf typically exports iron and textile goods. Reportedly there is a push in their society to open up towards the outside world and abandon their isolationist ways. Perhaps this is a good stepping stone one day Federating with them?"
 greneclyf_trade.19.a:0 "More friends mean more federation targets, yes!"
 greneclyf_trade.19.b:0 "The bugs are too distant and alien to ever be united with, no."

 greneclyf_trade.20.t:0 "Jezeragrad Agrees"
 greneclyf_trade.20.d:0 "Our Envoy returned today from Lake City with joyous news of our offer to trade being accepted whole-heartedly! Though they did speak of working towards a greater Coalition that would one day possibly include us."
 greneclyf_trade.20.a:0 "Did they now? That's something to consider."

 greneclyf_trade.21.t:0 "Jezeragrad Refuses"
 greneclyf_trade.21.d:0 "More bad news from the continent, Lake City rejected our offer to trade. Apparently nothing we had to offer would've impacted their economy much and we're far too distant physically for them to hold any interest in."
 greneclyf_trade.21.a:0 "Well what's that supposed to mean?"

 greneclyf_trade.22.t:0 "Bug Things from Greneclyf"
 greneclyf_trade.22.d:0 "We've recently received an envoy from the islander bug ponies off the coast. Despite all of the myths about these creatures as sinister emotion leeches that shapeshift to infiltrate our lives, these supposed creatures approached in their apparently original form. They came with the request for open trade in regard to our gems and other rare mineral stores in exchange for exotic fish, some iron and steel products, along with their own brand of textiles work. Despite how the myths painted these 'bugs', they're rather tiny and unassuming."
 greneclyf_trade.22.a:0 "The little bugs can have their way. It's only trade, after all."
 greneclyf_trade.22.b:0 "Never! They offer nothing valuable enough for our gems!"

 greneclyf_trade.23.t:0 "Diamond Mountain Accepts"
 greneclyf_trade.23.d:0 "Joyous news from one of our many envoys! The Diamond Dogs of, well, Diamond Mountain have accepted our request to open up trade! While reluctant at first, we managed to convince them we'd have something to offer that's worth their vast amount of gems."
 greneclyf_trade.23.a:0 "They're such good people!"

 greneclyf_trade.24.t:0 "Diamond Mountain Refuses"
 greneclyf_trade.24.d:0 "We've received bad news from one of our envoys, the one sent to Diamond Mountain. Apparently they were thrown out and laughed at for what we had to offer."
 greneclyf_trade.24.a:0 "Was it something that we've said?"

 greneclyf_trade.25.t:0 "The Second Expedition"
 greneclyf_trade.25.d:0 "With the success of our first expedition, we shall launch a second trade mission in the hopes of gathering new contacts, new friends, and better trade."
 greneclyf_trade.25.a:0 "Onwards to Equestria!"
 greneclyf_trade.25.b:0 "Let us rekindle with our kind!"

 greneclyf_trade.26.t:0 "Bug Ponies Exist, and They Want to Trade"
 greneclyf_trade.26.d:0 "The countryside has been set aflame with gossip regarding strange new visitors which, for lack of a better word, are bug ponies. They have horns and wings and sound funny too, but most importantly they've come wanting to open up a trade route to great Deponya! We don't necessarily have much to offer outside wheat (which might not even be what these bugs eat) however, they come offering iron, steel, and textile products! This is a good exchange, but then again, they are complete outsiders..."
 greneclyf_trade.26.a:0 "Any who show interest in our lovely nation are surely friends!"
 greneclyf_trade.26.b:0 "They're outsiders that aren't even ponies. They cannot be trusted." 
 
 greneclyf_trade.27.t:0 "Deponya Accepts"
 greneclyf_trade.27.d:0 "Our envoy from the Kingdom of Deponya arrived home today with news of acceptance to open up trade lanes to their country. While we can't expect many merchants from them to arrive, they'll happily accept ours! Though some merchants are concerned that they won't offer much in exchange of what we will offer."
 greneclyf.25.a:0 "Our purpose is to make friends, not money. This is a good thing!"

 greneclyf_trade.28.t:0 "Deponya Refuses"
 greneclyf_trade.28.d:0 "Our envoy to Deponya returned the next day after it was sent out. Apparently, our physical appearance and the fact we're 'outsiders' were reason enough to throw our envoy out. When they tried to reason with them threats were then used that forced our diplomat to retreat."
 greneclyf_trade.28.a:0 "Is the outside world really worth putting up with this?"

 greneclyf_trade.29.t:0 "Magic Wielding Bugs Desire to Trade Knowledge"
 greneclyf_trade.29.d:0 "Curiously enough, strange creatures of myth called changelings have arrived in the capital today. Knowledge of them exists primarily in orally passed down campfire tales of love-draining shapeshifters with sinister intent. While these stories are actually true about them...the ones who've come today have done so in peace. In fact they've shown the utmost respect and have come in their origin form as well. No reports of trouble or other misdeeds either after their arrival...perhaps they're genuine enough. \n\nRegardless the bugs have come with the desire to open up trade routes between Wittenburg and "Greneclyf", their island home. Aside from generic products such as iron, steel, and textiles...the bugs, these 'changelings' have made the interesting offer to exchange magical knowledge. Apparently the lore of changelings is vastly unknown as...we have no records on it. Perhaps this is a gold mine that has fallen right onto our lap? Then again...we know for sure the true nature of these creatures is naturally malicious. This could easily be nothing more than a show they're putting up to infiltrate our ranks..."
 greneclyf_trade.29.a:0 "Malicious or not, we must know their secrets."
 greneclyf_trade.29.b:0 "No price is enough to open ourselves up to possible parasites like them."

 greneclyf_trade.30.t:0 "Wittenland Accepts"
 greneclyf_trade.30.d:0 "Our envoy arrived back from the intellectual nation of Wittenland with great news. One of the more desired trade partners in our quest for outside contact has agreed to our offer on academic exchange with of course the more petty products in comparison we export."
 greneclyf_trade.30.a:0 "Is it really such a good idea to teach ponies our magic?"
 
 greneclyf_trade.31.t:0 "The Changelings Wish to Parley"
 greneclyf_trade.31.d:0 "We took on a strange envoy today in the form of some changelings hailing from Greneclyf. Normally they never leave their island home, but news came from the arrival that a push was being made to open up relations with the outside world beyond just Farbrook. This new approach goes hoof in hoof with the apparent Greneclyfian desire to follow the aspects of Harmony. To start with, they merely want to begin exchanging textiles in the form of trade."
 greneclyf_trade.31.a:0 "If Farbrook trusts them, why can't we?"
 greneclyf_trade.31.b:0 "The political climate isn't ripe for taking on new friends right now."

 greneclyf_trade.32.t:0 "Pònaidhean Agrees"
 greneclyf_trade.32.d:0 "News arrived today from our envoy to Pònaidhean with the expected news of acceptance. Those harmonic ponies can be relied to allow us to mingle with their people!"
 greneclyf_trade.32.a:0 "Was there ever any doubt?"

 greneclyf_trade.33.t:0 "Pònaidhean Refuses"
 greneclyf_trade.33.d:0 "We've received some very shocking news today from our envoy to Pònaidhean. They cannot handle any new trade contacts right now. Any offered explanation was incredibly vague! This doesn't bode well considering their supposed harmonist values."
 greneclyf_trade.33.a:0 "But... but why?"
 
 greneclyf_trade.34.t:0 "Wittenburg Refuses"
 greneclyf_trade.34.d:0 "The envoy from Wittenburg has returned with awful news. Despite a lengthly discussion about the positives of exchanging academics ultimately the leadership declined due to 'security risks' and 'knowledge of our natural behaviors'. Are we really so awful that we've been rejected just because of what we are?"
 greneclyf_trade.34.a:0 "It's not like we needed their magic knowledge anyway... did we?"
 
 ### TRADE CRISIS EVENTS ###
 greneclyf_crisis.2.t:0 "Greneclyfian Apprehended and Accused of Grievous Crime"
 greneclyf_crisis.2.d_BAK:0 "A merchant in Bakara was apprehended by local authorities under suspicion of having killed a local pony in the port town of Iceband. Reports are mixed, but what is certain is that a Bakaran is dead, and our citizen was found using their form as a disguise.\n\nWhile witnesses (of which none were present at the moment of the alleged crime) claim that the changeling had purposefully murdered a pony to assume their form and begin a murder spree, the accused said that they had acted in self defense, and that they had taken over their form in a panic upon realising that the aggressor was dead.\n\nIn either case, there is considerable revanchism on the side of Bakara calling for the head of our merchant. Where do we officially stand on this matter?"
 greneclyf_crisis.2.d_DMT:0 "Grave news from Dit-Kazaar on the continent: a Greneclyfian citizen is currently incarcerated awaiting trial for murder.\n\nWhat exactly has happened is unclear, but the local authorities claim that the suspect was found loitering near a murder scene. When prodded for further evidence implicating him, we were given a prompt reply of 'he looks like he did it.'\n\nNeedless to say, our citizen insists that he happened to have been wandering nearby when the police had discovered the body of the victim, though so far his pleads of innocence have fallen upon deaf ears. None of the local residents have spoken up in his defense, and most are convinced of his guilt despite the lack of hard evidence. Our people are aghast at the blatant display of injustice, so they look to us for a response."
 greneclyf_crisis.2.d_NIM:0 "From the nation of pegasi, Nimbusia, comes saddening news. One of our own was jailed and is awaiting trial for murder. The incident has caused a stir amongst the ponies, who were already going against their usual xenophobia by letting Greneclyfan merchants trade in their country. Now even most of the pro-harmony reformists have lost confidence in our species.\n\nBoth the changeling and the victim were allegedly travelling towards some sort of sacred city for the Nimbusians by the name of Prancetras. Friends of our subject say that he got curious after hearing stories of an oracle who lives there, however, shortly before the changeling reached the city, he encountered the victim, a pegasus citizen. Whatever transpired there ended with a dead pegasus and our subject assuming the identity of the pony he just killed. Of course he was found out soon afterwards and was arrested by the Nimbusian authorities.\n\nThe changeling has sworn that it was in fact the pegasus who attacked him, but testimonies by the victim's family and friends say the victim was an honourable citizen and a veteran too, making the Nimbusians skeptical towards his testimony. This case is turning into a nightmare for Nimbusian-Greneclyfian relations. Do we believe our citizen's story or do we back the Nimbusian authorities to save face?"
 greneclyf_crisis.2.d_FRE:0 "In Pònaidhean, one of the more quiet nations in the Riverlands, one of our subjects seems to have made a grave error. While travelling through the Pònaidhean hinterlands, one of our merchants got caught unawares by heavy rainfall. Luckily for him, he could take shelter in a cave, ignoring the strange stone slab with inscriptions on it that stood before the cave's entrance. Through the storm, two monks also traversed the same path as the changeling. When the monks walked past the cave, they saw the changeling's glowing eyes staring at them. A few seconds later, our citizen was overwhelmed and dragged out of the cave and the monks were shouting at him in an unknown language.\n\nIt turns out our subject ventured into a cave where an evil 'demon' was supposedly sealed away. Entering this cave is a grievous offence and extremely suspicious to the pious Pònaidheans. The Taoiseach of Pònaidhean has asked us for our opinion, stating that she is willing to believe this was a misunderstanding, but that letting the changeling go now may mean that the clans in her country vote for restrictions on trade with Greneclyf in the future..."
 greneclyf_crisis.2.a:0 "Plead for our citizen! They've done nothing wrong."
 greneclyf_crisis.2.b:0 "Say nothing. We should let them deal with it."
 greneclyf_crisis.2.c:0 "Insist on extraditing them to be tried at home."
 greneclyf_crisis.2.e:0 "Offer our full support to the local investigation."

 greneclyf_crisis.7.t:0 "Riverlands Trial of Greneclyfian Fuels Paranoia"
 greneclyf_crisis.7.d_BAK:0 "After many days behind closed doors, an utterly confused Greneclyfian was freely released by the authorities.\n\nIt is impossible to say why or how he was cleared of his accusations, as he was never a part of the proceedings between the Bakaran monks who deliberated the matter.\n\nWhilst our citizen was glad to be set free, many Bakarans were not. As he was being judged, orators in major cities repeated the story of the alleged crime, embellishing and adding further heinous acts with each retelling. By the time he was released, none of the Bakarans could believe that the monster that they had continously heard about was set free, and was chased away from the scene.\n\nNeedless to say, we have already sent our official protests to the Bakaran government, though our representatives there expect little sympathy from it."
 greneclyf_crisis.7.d_DMT:0 "A furious representative from Diamond Mountain stormed into the home of our on-site diplomat, soldiers in tow, demanding the whereabouts of the accused from last month. Apparently, the defendant fled from his confinement and has not been seen since the previous night.\n\nOur diplomat of course refuted any part in the defendant's escape and offered a stern condemnation of their actions, but in private has expressed relief over the matter. The few times that the accused had been seen by his fellow Greneclyfians, it was in a dungeon under horrendous conditions. What little food was given was woefully inadequate, and the last time a close friend saw him, the jailed changeling was severely emanciated. It is little wonder that he has escaped his confinement in light of the circumstances.\n\nDespite our official condemnation of the defendant's escape, many diamond dogs were left convinced that there was no way that he had managed to do so unaided, and are now eyeing other Greneclyfians with suspicion."
 greneclyf_crisis.7.d_NIM:0 "The reformist party had collected some money to buy a decent attorney for the changeling on trial in Nimbusia. The trials in the country were quite populist affairs, however, and our subject was already disadvantaged by being both a foreigner and a changeling. Still, the pegasus attorney delivered a flaming speech arguing that there was absolutely no evidence for the murder, pointing out that his client was unarmed and a weapon was found on the body of the dead pegasus. The lawyer of the victim countered by a gross depiction of stereotypes. The attorney played the crowd and fed their fears of the unknown. Despite no evidence that the changeling was actually guilty, the jury of citizens deemed the evidence substantive enough, referring to our subject as the "insectoid monster."\n\nThe trial continued to the second phase, where both the accused and the accuser got to propose a punishment. The defense attorney, under pressure and cornered by the mood of the crowd, decided to push for banishment, while the attacker pleaded for the death penalty. Thanks to the excellent oration of our lawyer, our citizen narrowly escaped death, with the attorney convincing just enough ponies to let the changeling leave, without his possessions, of course. Although our subject escaped Nimbusia with his life, opinions towards changelings in Nimbusia have soured even more."
 greneclyf_crisis.7.d_FRE:0 "In Dail Mhòr, the court proceedings took place against the changeling accused for trespassing and summoning a demon. With the law system separated by Pònaidhean tribe, the Taoiseach had no choice but to make the changeling a temporary honourary member of her own clan. With that, the framework of laws was set.\n\nOur subject was helpless against the clan elders and the monks who acted as witnesses. Most of the court proceedings happened in a language our citizen couldn't even understand and nopony offered him legal counsel. The crimes of the changeling were extremely exaggerated by the elders in the end, as they seemed to truly believe that if the monks hadn't stopped him, the accused would have unleashed a terrible spirit. So, they gave the changeling a sentence of being taken in at a monastery for three years or until he came to repent his demonic past, whichever came later. Without any proper way of defending himself, our subject was dragged off to some forgotten mountaintop, forced into the Pònaidheans' weird religious institutions."

 greneclyf_crisis.8.t:0 "Rumours Snake Through the Riverlands"
 greneclyf_crisis.8.d:0 "Ever since the infamous trial of the Greneclyfian changeling, rumours have been spreading about the changelings already present within the whole of the Riverlands. All member races of the Riverlands, both dog and pony, have begun treating them as if they were monsters: cruel, uncaring and ravenous. These rumours are scaring the population all across the Coalition, and relations with the changelings are, as of result, rapidly deteriorating. There are already scattered reports of hate crime related atrocities being committed against Greneclyfians, although these are, thankfully, relatively few and far between as of yet.\n\nThere has been no official response from the island nation as of yet, but it will almost certainly be unfavourable."
 greneclyf_crisis.8.a:0 "Our citizens' well-being matters more than the feelings of some bugs'."
 
 greneclyf_crisis.9.t:0 "Rumours Spread about our People"
 greneclyf_crisis.9.d:0 "The trial of one of our own has been noticed throughout the Riverlands. More and more reports are coming in of incidents of flat-out racism against our kind, and more Riverland companies refused cooperation with Greneclyf for reasons we suspect to be because of our race. Our citizens are looking to us for instructions. Some even openly ask if they should give up on friendship with the Riverlands entirely.\n\nFour options are available to us and careful consideration must be made for the safety of our people and our relations with the continentals. We could tell our people to be on guard, although this may make Greneclyfians seem suspicious. We could ask them to be friendlier and patient with those giving them a hard time, to show them our good side. We could also advise our people to consider returning home if they feel threatened, but this may be seen as giving up. Lastly, we could refuse to change course at all."

 greneclyf_crisis.14.d:0 "Previously, some of our merchants in the continent had claimed that the Riverlanders were deliberately avoiding to do business with them due to suspected racism. It was a side effect back then, but now people are actively refusing to purchase in our stores abroad. Many of our people have also been refused service in local shops, lending further credence that this is a concentrated effort.\n\nAs a result, our people are reporting losses that will eventually push them out of the markets on the continent if they are not addressed. Many of our merchants have called for retaliatory boycotts back at home, even though by all accounts foreign traders have been keeping perfectly fair and legal activities in Greneclyf. Some have suggested to show good will on our part by subsidising our people's purchases of local goods in the continent, whereas others advise to simply help our traders there to recoup their losses.\n\nWhat should we tell our people?"
 greneclyf_crisis.14.a:0 "Help our people purchase the goods of the locals."
 greneclyf_crisis.14.b:0 "Cover the losses that our merchants are suffering."
 greneclyf_crisis.14.c:0 "Impose boycotts against foreign businesses in Blosmport."

These roving bands of thugs have prompted some of our citizens to ignore our previous instructions and actively engage them with their own ad-hoc groups. Fortunately these confrontations haven't caused any deaths, but there has been at least one critical injury so far.\n\nOur representatives have been drowning in protests from the respective governments regarding the behaviour of our changelings, promising dire consequences if the matter isn't addressed promptly and in a satisfactory manner. Our diplomats are looking to us for a formal response."

 greneclyf_crisis.24.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, the continentals couldn't shake free of their preconceived perceptions of us, and have let their fears lash out at our people. They've endured for many weeks, but there has been no end in sight to the prejudice suffered at the hooves of our people. Ships laden with changelings have returned to Greneclyf seeking respite from the terrible treatment abroad. Unfortunately, these same changelings took out their anger at the continentals who willingly came here.\n\nThe recently inaugurated merchant district in Blosmport was mobbed by the returning merchants and adventurers, actively attacking ponies who were only guilty by association. There were no reported deaths from the clashes, but many were injured, some severely, and the entire district was utterly devastated by ransacking and looting.\n\nOnce the news returned on the continent, we were issued an ultimatum by the entire Coalition: leave their lands and never return.\n\nWith no other choice, we had to acquiesce to their demands and end our official relations with a sour note. People in Greneclyf are now seriously questioning the entire endeavour that [Root.GetLeader] had launched into the continent, as well what must be done in order to move forward in the world.\n\nAre we truly without merit in the eyes of the foreigners?"

 greneclyf_crisis.25.d:0 "After punishing the Greneclyfians responsible for inciting violence, there has been a tense if calm period within our communities in the continent. Many of the violent locals have either been arrested by the authorities or have been shamed into submission by the majority of Riverlanders. It appears that we have finally defeated the caricature that had been placed upon us, and have earned if not amiable admiration, at least a grudging respect of our level-headed approach to the troubles that our people have had.\n\nMany natives have admitted shame of their past actions and have asked for forgiveness for their folly and blind fear that they once held. As expected, almost every Greneclyfian has wholeheartedly accepted their apologies and have, in true Greneclyfian spirit, extended a hoof of friendship to those who had wronged them before. While most of our communities are still fairly separated from those of local residents, there are some that are integrating very quickly and very well.\n\nBusiness has returned to normal, and there is nary a sign of trouble ahead for our people. Greneclyfians have finally stepped into the wider world, and we have not been shunned for it."

### POLITICAL EVENTS ###
 greneclyf.29.t:0 "A Loss of Faith"
 greneclyf.29.d:0 "The reports have been both incessant and disheartening. Many of our trading deals are failing, either by staunch refusal to our offers or by cessation of those accepted by the other parties. These have severely demoralised our people, but none more so than Queen Gytha. Upon hearing word of the latest failure, she lost herself in open despair, affecting a few too close to her. After much struggle, the Queen managed to sober up enough to close herself off in her personal chamber.\n\nShut off from everyone, the Queen has left no one on the seat of power, and no one is sure as to what can be done. As of right now, there is no one to look towards for a sense of stability, and panic is gripping the nation."
 greneclyf.29.a:0 "Sunderer protect us!"

 greneclyf.30.t:0 "The Council of Royals Deliberates"
 greneclyf.30.d:0 "All of the significant members of the Council have convened in Blosmport for the emergency call sent by those closest to the Queen. After several days of intense dialogue and discussion, an urgent matter has to be resolved today, namely what must be done with the Queen.\n\nFor past week Queen Gytha has been absent from nearly all affairs of statehood, after having locked herself in her private chambers, and is refusing to see anyone; not even her closest friends and advisors can reach to the Queen. With no one at the throne, Greneclyf risks collapse if it continues to remain empty. The Queen's House does not have a suitable replacement, and thus the Council's is considering to invoke a vote. Of the many candidates, Princess Oiren of House Aurelia is the prominent and plausible alternative.\n\nBeing the eldest Royal out of all of the suitable candidates —second only to the Queen— Oiren is a far more reserved Royal compared to Gytha, and has championed a more isolationist policy. This would fly in the face of a tradition that has been followed for centuries, and there are a few in the Council openly questioning Oiren's motives. She has insisted that her priorities are for Greneclyf first and foremost, and that her actions are not motivated by her House's ancient rivalry with House Lepidoptera, the Queen's House. Were the Council to invoke the vote, Oiren is certain to win, as all of the other viable candidates pale in comparison to her experience and popularity.\n\nSome of the Council are still hoping for Queen Gytha to recover from whatever is afflicting her, and that she will soon return to bring back at least some semblance of order. House Lepidotpera has ruled continually for centuries, and both its regents and their philosophies have brought us peace and stability. Perhaps the best course for Greneclyf is to wait for the Queen to come back to us."
 greneclyf.30.a:0 "Queen Gytha isn't wholly lost. We trust in a speedy recovery."
 greneclyf.30.b:0 "Gytha is incapable of leading anymore. Let us hold the vote!"

 greneclyf.31.t:0 "The Queen Recovers" 
 greneclyf.31.d:0 "Fortunately for everyone, Queen Gytha has emerged once more from her private quarters and seems to be shockingly rejuvenated altogether after her initial panic attack some time ago. Many feared that she might have become suicidal in her battle against depression, especially after she had begun to refuse to eat.\n\n Such worries can now be safely dismissed, though there are still concerns of her convictions. Most will still follow the Queen, though the certainty from just a few months ago has been replaced by an air of trepidation and anxiousness." 
 greneclyf.31.a:0 "Where will Gytha take Greneclyf now?"

 greneclyf.32.t:0 "What Must be Done with Farbrook"
 greneclyf.32.d:0 "Farbrook has always been a friend to us. However they have shown us that friendship was false. In order to expand our influence, we must first deal with these traitors. But how should we approach this problem?"

 greneclyf.38.t:0 "Greneclyfian Coup Successful"
 greneclyf.38.d:0 "Radicals have ceased control of the country. Now all that remains is to decide what to do with it. Should we kneel under the Grenclyfians and join their empire? This will mean that we cease to exist as an independent country."

 greneclyf.68.d:0 "A vote has been called, and after an hour of deliberation, the Council has declared Oiren of House Aurelia Queen of Greneclyf.\n\nThe result was a foregone conclusion, as none of the other candidates were anywhere near as qualified or popular as Princess Oiren, and the vote was merely a formality. Despite the almost trivial proceedings, this is still a profound moment in the history of Greneclyf. After over 800 years of uninterrupted rule, a member of the House of Lepidoptera has been voted out for someone from a different Royal House."
 greneclyf.68.a:0 "May fresh blood steer our country true!"

 greneclyf.69.t:0 "A Final Embrace"
 greneclyf.69.d:0 ""Gytha," a tired voice pleaded. "Please say something."\n\nFeilean was out of uniform, as he had spent the past three hours trying to comfort his sister as the latest reports came in.\n\nThe Queen had gone through the gamut of reactions, from disbelief, to open weeping and now, a silent dread. Only the ebbing vestiges of the words of Gytha's brother still echoed through the chamber. Even the dropped title did not rouse the changeling as her eyes saw something that did not exist.\n\nFeilean approached the Queen. "Please," he repeated with a more emphatic tone. He almost sounded desperate.\n\nGytha's gaze grew focused but remained cast downwards. After a pregnant pause, she said, "Leave us."\n\nHer voice was neutral, but it left Feilean uneasy. The herald bowed her head and left. He probably should have joined the drone, yet he could not do so—not yet. His little sister needed someling to offer comfort.\n\n"We– we could try something different," Feilean said. "We still have time to course-correct."\n\nHe suddenly felt a snout nuzzling upon his neck frill. Gytha had embraced him without warning. "Thank you, big brother." Her voice was barely louder than a whisper. "I love you so much for all that you have done."\n\nFeilean hesitated at first but soon returned the embrace. After a long moment of warm comfort, she added, "Please. I need some time alone."\n\nAgain he hesitated to break the contact, though he obediently did so. He made for the door, shooting back a glance. "I will always be here for you, Gytha." A faint smile with watery eyes met his promise.\n\nGytha's stare lingered upon the door before it eventually drifted upwards towards the chandelier of the chamber. She gauged it for a long while; it would probably do."

 #greneclyf.111.d:0 "When I heard about the House of Praise opening, I was sceptical. The Deoirethe that built it and others in the wake of their return never sat right with me. They claim that they were a local tradition in Aisling. They're small, rustic buildings, but there was a quality to them that called to me and many other sceptics. Their first Poet Call saw the pews stuffed with the curious and critics, with many filling the empty spaces in between.\n\nThe Praise Poet, a small, frail-looking drone in a beige robe, greeted us all with an open heart and spoke at length, retelling the tale of the Sunderer. It was nothing that we hadn't heard of before, but there was a noticeable tone of devotion in her voice that wasn't present in most retellings.\n\nI could already sense some guilt from some of the other spectators. They evidently hadn't given much thought about just how much changelings owed their existence to the Sunderer, but I, and I suspect most others, still were unmoved by the flowery prose.\n\nThen the Praise Singers sang\n\nThere was no instrumental accompaniment. It was a short poetical hymn that was about as eloquent as the Poet's earlier oration and, when put into writing, wasn't particularly eye-catching.\n\nBut the symphony... it touched my soul. The utter purity of the voices showed a harmonious quality that I had never believed that we shared. This is a part of our identity, and we had chased it away a century back. How could we have done so?\n\nWhen the choral finished, the entire audience was openly crying. My heart, both burdened with remorse but brought to peace by the song, had moved me to sob.  To this, the Praise Poet spoke:\n\n"Take these words ye faithful ones. Out of the dust were we born, and to the dust, we will return. Ye do not yet know the toil that They have made to bring you here, born on this lonely paradise. So They favoured your ancestors to grow in both Body and Mind, making them aware of themselves. Ye have just awoke; now ye must build and craft community as the creator has formed ye."\n\nI have, and I vow that we shall never again cut away a piece of ourselves. For the Sunderer."

 #greneclyf..d:0 "Much time has passed with the Queen absent from the affairs of state. While the Council debates what to do, something dark has been taking root in Gytha's mind...\n\nHarmony was supposed to be the path, as it had been for centuries, but it has led us astray. The world refuses to help Greneclyf solely because of their primal fear of changelings. How can a changeling befriend someone who fears them? How can a changeling love someone who hates them? How can Gytha trust Cenhelm if he refuses to help her?\n\nWell, something from deep within the Queen has taken over, and it is ancient.\n\nA new hunger permeates the air wherever Gytha is present, and while she appears to have recovered from her break, there is something hidden behind her fanged smiles and glowing eyes. This is a changeling Royal reborn, and one who has a sole purpose now: protect and feed her Hive, no matter the cost.\n\nDark clouds are gathering on the isle, and they threaten to billow forth unto the continent."
 #greneclyf..a:0 "If it's monsters they want..."

 #greneclyf..t:0 "Together Once More"
 #greneclyf..d:0 "We have seen the other continent, and while there are many things that are disconcerting about Queen Chrysalis and her subjects, it is ultimately irrelevant — we are bound by biology.\n\nQueen Gytha and Chrysalis have spent much time in private discussing at great lengths as to how their respective nations can work better together moving forwards. At first, those closest to Gytha told of her adamantly frustrated by their ideological differences. Something has changed recently, however; the Greneclyfian Royal is no longer as approachable as she had been, and many wonder what could have brought about this change.\n\nRegardless, this shift has coincided with a breakthrough in the Royals' private negotiations. Greneclyf will serve as a faithful ally to our kin from across the sea, bound by the blood of our kind. Some still wonder if this new Queen Gytha will be prepared for this challenge, however..."
 #greneclyf..a:0 "§GQueen Chrysalis was very convincing.§!"

 #greneclyf..t:0 "A Frank Talk Between Queens"
 #greneclyf..d:0 "Many trembled in fear when they saw their queen's furious response to Chrysalis's challenge. While her erstwhile intent was to arrest Chrysalis, Queen Gytha instead decided to try to finally stamp out Chrysalis's ideals. Long hours passed after that first confrontation, leaving many waiting with bated breath for the outcome. Surprisingly enough, a seemingly humbled Chrysalis accompanied Gytha to be shown the errors of her ways.\n\n"No more lying, no more scheming," said the Queen. "Chrysalis's goals are united with Our own."\n\nSo with the two Royals finally in agreement, Greneclyf appears prepared to finally tackle the question of how to proceed in light of the great nations refusing our offers of peace and love. One thing is for certain though: Chrysalis shall work with Gytha as a close advisor."

The blindfold, symbolising the perceived desire of non-changelings not to speak with Greneclyfians, has become synonymous with the stewing resentment among the populace.\n\nThe growing radicalisation of the movement has shaken the people's faith in the Leamhan approach of governance and foreign policy, and we've seen political support waning. We can expect this to continue if the people's call for a governmental response to Dairile's question that she posed sixty years ago is ignored.

With a more robust fuselage and engine than its predecessor, the ET08 was another model intended to replace the somewhat antiquated ET06. In achieving this performance however, the ET08 was deemed difficult to fly according to many pilots, leaving it with few pilots qualified to fly it."

 NCH_medium_tank_aa_equipment_2_desc:0 "Seeing the field modification made on the Curadh for use in an anti-air role, BnG submitted a plan for a SPAAG tank from the ground up. The 'Sábh' was based on the Laoch chassis, and had a much larger turret housing for a 37mm autocannon that allowed for a high angle of fire. The Greneclyfian High Command initially did not accept the design, but a demonstration of the vehicle convinced officers to approve it. A limited production run saw limited models in the army, and its overall combat effectiveness is disputed."

 NCH_medium_tank_artillery_equipment_3_desc:0 "The original design for a casemate version of the Troid was rejected when it became clear that it would not have been able to mount a suitably large gun. Intent on making a SPG with the Troid chassis, BnG presented an open-top design. The 100mm howitzer, while devastating, proved to be too much for the redesigned 'Tormán', and the gun mounting would sometimes shear off after sustained fire. Nevertheless, it was readily adopted and saw success during its service life."

Intent on making a SPG with the Troid chassis, BnG presented an open-top design. The 'Poll' carried a large 90mm gun that was excellent, and had enough capacity for long engagements. Due to the modification of the Poll however, it was very vulnerable to infantry, artillery, and air attacks. As such, crews had to get inventive in hiding the vehicle when in combat to ensure its survivability."

 NCH_medium_tank_aa_equipment_3_desc:0 "Difficulties encountered in the Piobaraithe's turret forced engineers to reconsider the original turret for the 'Saillteoir' SPAAG. The Saillteoir's somewhat open-topped turret meant that only 12.7mm machineguns in a dual configuration were viable as main armaments. Trading overall killing power for compact weapons meant that the Saillteoir had considerable staying power, and it outlasted its competitors in endurance trials. Despite the simplified turret, the medium SPAAG saw limited numbers."

 NCH_modern_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Hopes were high after the adoption of the Troid, as experiences in the field saw a homogenisation of the classes of tank into a single one. The 'Bacsálái' would have been the next step in the evolution of the Greneclyfian 'Combat Tank', meant to be a standardisation of modern tank designs, with an innovation in caterpillar tracks and turret design. However, with the change in leadership goals, the Bacsálái was never more than a concept on paper in the BnG archives."

 NCH_modern_tank_equipment_x_desc:0 "By 1017 the Greneclyfian tank corps had a fleet of aging tanks, and was looking to restart its tank programme. Much to the disappointment of Greneclyfian patriots, the pro-Stalliongradian government opted to adopt the T-44 as its newest Combat Tank. This was to be the beginning of Stalliongradian designs being adapted for use by changeling crews, making them notably distinct from their Stalliongradian counterparts. For all intents and purposes, the 'Carbadóir' was a much-needed modern tank that replaced the obsolete Easógs and Troids."

 NCH_modern_tank_equipment_x_2_desc:0 "The Greneclyfian T-54-18 variant was known as the 'Féan', and like the Stalliongradian MBT, the Féan had a small size and low silhouette. Its fighting compartment was considerably less cramped for a changeling crew and thus allowed for a better gun elevation, a serious problem in the T-54-18. The Féan did, however, have a lower quality armour that couldn't withstand fire as well as its Stalliongradian counterpart, and was not corrected until subsequent production runs of the Féan."

Like the T-54B, the Páiste's primary improvements were the egg-shaped turret that provided more protection in the fighting compartment, and the improved 100mm tank gun with a stabiliser. The Páiste saw the usual advantages over its parent vehicle such as a more spacious interior and better crew ergonomics, but initial production encountered difficulties with the new transmission gear that was unique to the Páiste."

Like the discarded Bacsálái, the Leanbh was meant to be a standardised combat tank to help streamline production and maintenance. This reality never came to be, as previous iterations of the combat tanks continued to serve along with the Leanbh, which did lead to the anticipated challenges of supplies.

However, the 'Claimhteoir' had a terrible trial, mostly having problems with the new smoothbore gun. From the cramped turret, an automatic ejector that sent spent cartridges bouncing wildly inside, and crude gun control, the Claimhteoir was rejected before its demonstration was concluded. Newer Claimhteoir designs were presented, but the army remained satisfied with the Páiste and Leanbh tanks."

 NCH_super_heavy_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Military observers had noticed the growing efficacy of aerial bombardment against fortified artillery, and this concerned military planners responsible of the defense of Greneclyf. Stationary targets, no matter how well fortified, would be at the mercy of bombers. The idea of a mobile bunker, something of a derivative of the Dúnán, was developed over several years. The project encountered countless difficulties and only produced a single prototype that failed to impress during military trials in 1012. The only existing model was scrapped later in 1014."

 NCH_super_heavy_tank_equipment_x_desc:0 "Unsatisfied with the mobile bunker idea, some BnG engineers saw enemy fortified bunkers as a greater concern, and proceeded to design the 'Reithe Cogaidh'. More of an artillery piece than a tank, the Reithe Cogaidh was meant to eliminate any armoured target with its massive 105mm gun, and had to adopt an enlarged turret from the Bacsálái's and its tracks for the heavy tank to be viable. Only the chassis was constructed before the project was cancelled due to new peace-time priorities."

 NCH_super_heavy_tank_equipment_x_2_desc:0 "The 'Rud 280' was an alternative design to the Object 279, though originally rejected at the Tank Bureau in Stalliongrad. The Rud 280 was a collaborative effort between Stalliongrad and Greneclyf in experiments with a four-track running gear, but with an electric gearbox. The overall weight of the tank was greater than that of the 279, but its ground pressure was still relatively low. Trials in Greneclyf concluded that the gearbox allowed for a speedy reverse acceleration but poor top speed. The project fell through when Stalliongrad retired the head designer."

This, however, made her a noble of nothing in her home of Aisling. The life of nobility never captured Cait's interest and she promptly left it to take on her family's expertise at sea. Coming from a family of traditional sea drones, it wasn't much of a surprise. Unlike her parents, however, the young queen found a career as a naval officer in the defence flotilla of Aisling and made a name for herself.\n\nOnce the Greneclyfian Admiralty was formed, Cait's name was put forward and her experience catapulted to the rank of admiral, as Greneclyf was desperate for admirals. Being a seasoned naval officer, Admiral Murchbagh had several victories against raiders and pirates under her belt and was known to be a dangerous opponent to her foes. Some from the Council of Royals may have baulked at Cait's career path. In contrast, she has often said that she felt most at home at the helm of a warship, and that 'I wouldn't trade it for all of the titles and riches of Greneclyf.'\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Empress Bridle"

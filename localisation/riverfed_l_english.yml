 #### IDEAS ####
 RIV_member_state:0 "Treaty of Coltstream Member"
 RIV_member_state_desc:0 "This state has signed the Treaty of Coltstream. In 898 the River Coalition was founded after an attack by the Griffon Orders was pushed back. The founding members of the treaty were Lake City, Deponya, River City and Nimbusia. Although the treaty has been mainly a defensive alliance since its inception, some politicians and their supporters advocate to expand the treaty to allow for more cooperation between the states of the River Coalition."
 RIV_rcsc_member:0 "RCSC Member"
 RIV_rcsc_member_desc:0 "This State has signed the Treaty of Coltstream and has opted into the River Coal and Steel Community. Hailed as an inventive solution to solve rivalry between the states of the Coalition, the RCSC has pooled the markets for coal and steel, the prime resources for warfare. The member states have given authority over these markets to a Coalition oversight committee. By interlinking the industries of warfare between the member states, the RCSC hopes to prevent warfare between its members."
 RIV_rec_member:0 "REC Member"
 RIV_rec_member_desc:0 "This state is a member of the River Economic Community, the successor to the RCSC. The REC has pledged to go beyond just Coal and Steel and incorporate the entire economy. By slashing tariffs between the member states and encouraging and equal playing field for competition, the smaller member states hope to compete against countries with bigger markets. This has meant more authority has flowed to the oversight committee and away from the national governments."
 RIV_river_union_member:0 "River Union Member State"
 RIV_river_union_member_desc:0 "This state is a member of the River Union, the successor to the REC. The Union is much more centralised than its predecessor and has taken responsibility for all sorts of policy areas. Much speculation abounds when the United Parliament will push for more centralisation, which might lead to a full-fledged federation.”
 RIV_rdc:0 "River Development Company"
 RIV_rdc_desc:0 "Although in the past the Coalition has done much to develop their neighbours, the help has been undirected and decentralised. To help guide the good intentions of the Coalition to where they are most needed, the River Development Company has been founded. Consolidating funds and experts from all the member states, the RDC uses their assets to help the construction of new factories, highways, railroads and dockyards."
 RIV_beings_rights_idea:0 "River Convention on Beings Rights"
 RIV_beings_rights_idea_desc:0 "This nation is a signatory of the River Convention on Beings Rights"
 RIV_development_grants_idea:0 "Development Grants"
 RIV_centeral_bank_idea:0 "River Central Bank"
 RIV_centeral_bank_idea_desc:0 "For monetary matters, the River Central Bank coordinates our own Central Bank, as well as those of our friends. This will help to keep rampant inflation at bay and ensure that there is always enough money to go around."
 RIV_rivbit_idea:0 "The Rivbit"
 RIV_rivbit_idea_desc:0 "We are a member of the single currency area and have replaced our own coins with the Rivbit! This has increased both tourism and international trade and has further stabilised our economy."
 RIV_river_army_idea:0 "The River Army"
 RIV_river_army_idea_desc:0 "We have integrated our armed forces with the River Army. Although the armies of the different states are still formally under the control of their own governments, the River Army Command coordinates and directs the armed forces from now on."
 
 
 #### FOCUS ####
 RIV_dreams_of_a_federation:0 "Dreams of a Federation"
 RIV_dreams_of_a_federation_desc:0 "The treaty of Coltstream was designed in such a way that the coalition members could choose to expand the treaty to certain policy areas. It is a far cry from true political unity, but by breaking open discussion about expanding the treaty, we might be able to set a step in the direction of a true River Federation."
 
 RIV_science_society:0 "River Science Society"
 RIV_science_society_desc:0 "The different countries that comprise the treaty all have their own universities with their own expertise. Encouraging an exchange of knowledge and of students themselves will help all member states to broaden their horizons and push the boundaries of science towards the modern age."
 
 RIV_found_the_rcsc:0 "The River Coal and Steel Community"
 RIV_found_the_rcsc_desc:0 "Initially proposed by River City foreign minister Calm Current, the River Coal and Steel Community (RCSC) will be an organisation to regulate the industrial production of all Riverland states. The goal of this is to ensure continued peace and cooperation between all member states by creating a common market for coal and steel, thus neutralising competition over resources."
 
 RIV_develop_DEP:0 "Invest in Deponya"
 RIV_develop_DEP_desc:0 "Deponya is one of the smaller members of the treaty. To strengthen our relations with them and to make our ally able to contribute more to the alliance, we can invest in Deponya. Purchasing a significant patch of forest for industrial development will surely help our friends along!"
 
 RIV_build_roads_in_DEP:0 "Build Roads in Deponya"
 RIV_build_roads_in_DEP_desc:0 "Deponya shares a border with griffon territory, but their borderlands lack proper infrastructure. If the Coalition is to properly defend themselves against any sudden threats, our forces should be able to quickly move towards the border. Deponya lacks sufficient industrial capacity to do undertake a large public works effort in the area, so it is up to us to prepare the borderlands for military manoeuvres."

 RIV_development_grants_DEP:0 "Development Grants for Deponya"
 RIV_development_grants_DEP_desc:0 "More must be done to lift the state of Deponya up to the level of the rest of the Coalition. We will make development grants available to their government. The Deponyans might be a bit clingy towards their traditions, but with enough compensation, even they might see the value in progress!"

 RIV_develop_FRE:0 "Invest in Pònaidhean"
 RIV_develop_FRE_desc:0 "Pònaidhean is one of the weaker members of the Coalition. Their country consists mostly of rugged highlands. By investing in large scale excavation, we can make a larger part of the country actually fit for industrialisation. Surely the tribes will enjoy their newfound wealth." 
  
 RIV_build_roads_in_FRE:0 "Build Roads in Pònaidhean"
 RIV_build_roads_in_FRE_desc:0 "Pònaidhean shares a border with the deer clans to the south. The exact motives of these creatures are unknown to us, but it wouldn’t hurt to prepare infrastructure in the area, in case large troop movements are required. Who knows, maybe this will help bring Pònaidhean’s tribes closer together?"
 
 RIV_development_grants_FRE:0 "Development Grants in Pònaidhean"
 RIV_development_grants_FRE_desc:0 "More must be done to lift the state of Pònaidhean up to the level of the rest of the Coalition. We will make development grants available to their government. Some Pònaidheans might prefer to stay as isolated tribes, but they will soon see the value of cooperation!"

 RIV_found_the_rdc:0 "The River Development Company"
 RIV_found_the_rdc_desc:0 "The Coalition has, informally, done much to develop the most backward member nations. To formalise this development, we will make an independent River Development Company. We will give them the experts and funding they need to develop industry and infrastructure for the entire Coalition. If we get all our friends to help, we will all benefit!"

 RIV_found_the_rec:0 "The River Economic Community"
 RIV_found_the_rec_desc:0 "The RCSC has been a resounding success. We must now push forward and try to integrate more sections of the economy. This will make our economies less dependent on the outside and more resilient. To help in this plan we shall propose that the RCSC will be transformed into the River Economic Community. It is time to call for another treaty conference!"

 RIV_social_fund:0 "Establish a Social Fund"
 RIV_social_fund_desc:0 "The differences between labour laws and social security between the different member states is a cause for concern. We cannot integrate our economies while our social programs remain different. To curtail the worst situations, we will establish the Social Fund to protect workers from all member states."

 RIV_rdc_rail_projects:0 "RDC Rail Projects"
 RIV_rdc_rail_projects_desc:0 "The RDC has made it her mission to connect the many far-flung places in Eastern Griffonia. By inviting their engineers we will be able to connect our hinterlands together. We have but to draft an official plan and request to the Company."

 RIV_eastern_transport_fund:0 "Fund RiverTrans"
 RIV_eastern_transport_fund_desc:0 "RiverTrans is a proposal by the River Development Company to increase connectivity across the member states by making an international transportation company. RiverTrans will develop the traditionally neglected border roads and railroads to ensure that it is as easy to travel between countries as it is within countries. "

 RIV_beings_rights:0 "Write the Declaration of Beings Rights"
 RIV_beings_rights_desc:0 "We are not merely an economic community, but also a community of shared values. Let us enshrine those values in a treaty of the rights of all beings, including the right to free speech, freedom, a fair trial and all such things. Such a declaration will surely increase our standing in the world."

 RIV_river_parliament:0 "Found the River Parliament"
 RIV_river_parliament_desc:0 "The project of integration of the river states is not a project of the elites alone. We must be sure to keep the citizens involved as well. By making a directly elected parliament of the River Community. By giving this parliament a say in some matters that concern the entire Community, we are sure to increase popular support for more integration."

 RIV_rdc_industry_projects:0 "RDC Industrial Projects"
 RIV_rdc_industry_projects_desc:0 "One of the RDC’s primary goals is increasing economic growth. By opening up new industrial sectors and guaranteeing private investors, the Company increases industrial capacity. We can make use of their services ourselves, granting us a state of the art factory."

 RIV_rdc_local_investment_funds:0 "RDC Investment Funds"
 RIV_rdc_local_investment_funds_desc:0 "The RDC has several funds available to invest in regional projects. We could spend some time to lobby to the Company that they should invest more into our country. Not only might this help our industry, it may help to convince our population that the River Coalition is beneficial for our country."
 
 RIV_develop_friends:0 "Send Delegations to the Northern Ponies"
 RIV_develop_friends_desc:0 "The isolated Northern Ponies are a somewhat unknown factor to us. But most of the ponies in the Coalition see them as their long lost cousins either way. It is time to send some delegates and some precious gifts to these pony states so we can open up diplomatic contact."

 RIV_develop_firtree:0 "Assist Firtree"
 RIV_develop_firtree_desc:0 "The Firtree Villages are an agrarian society who have yet to fully industrialise. We can use the development grant program to help the Bonedrift government along. Perhaps if we show the ponies of Firtree our generosity, they will want to be our friends."

 RIV_develop_farbrook:0 "Assist Farbrook"
 RIV_develop_farbrook_desc:0 "Farbrook is the largest of the Northern Pony states, but the ponies there don’t have it any better when it comes to their industry. If we assist the ponies of Farbrook, surely they will want to stick with us!"

 RIV_develop_watertowns:0 "Assist the Watertowns"
 RIV_develop_watertowns_desc:0 "We heard stories of the Legendary Holy Springs near the Watertowns. However, Holy Water seems to be about the only thing the small state has going for it. By assisting the Watertowns with industrial aid, they might be willing to establish closer ties with us."

 RIV_friends_with_greneclyf:0 "Send an Emissary to the Changelings"
 RIV_friends_with_greneclyf_desc:0 "Of the coast lies an island inhabited by strange creatures called Changelings. They surely look more like ponies than the griffons do and we have heard stories about their Queen being a harmonist. Perhaps if we reach out to them, we will be able to make an unlikely friend?"

 RIV_expand_the_federation:0 "Offer Membership to the North"
 RIV_expand_the_federation_desc:0 "Much has been done to improve ties between the Riverlands and the northern pony states. Emissaries have even been sent to the changelings of Greneclyf. It is time to go even farther and formally ask these states to join the treaty of Coltstream!"

 RIV_free_movement:0 "A Free Travel Area"
 RIV_free_movement_desc:0 "If our economies are to be integrated, it makes no sense that goods and people can’t easily travel between the member states of the REC. We will propose a Free Travel Area between the countries, so that all our citizens can freely move around. This will surely help economic growth. With luck, it will also help create understanding between all the different people of the Community."

 RIV_centeral_bank:0 "River Central Bank"
 RIV_centeral_bank_desc:0 "To control the monetary matters of the Community, we must coordinate the efforts of the national banks of the member states. A Supranational Central Bank will make sure that the all national banks play fair. If we push this idea, perhaps we can deliver the Bank’s first President, increasing our power in the expanding Community bureaucracy."

 RIV_the_rivbit:0 "The Rivbit"
 RIV_the_rivbit_desc:0 "It is a very annoying matter to exchange currency whenever you go abroad. This matter is even worse for companies that trade in more of the member state. To show both political unity and to help improve trade between the Community Members, let us propose a single currency, the Rivbit!"

 RIV_the_river_union:0 "The River Union"
 RIV_the_river_union_desc:0 "There has been a wild growth of institutions, tasks and laws regarding the River Economic Community. We will need a new Treaty Conference to make sense of it all and to untangle the bureaucratic mess we have created. With a free trade area, free travel and a single currency, we can proudly call ourselves The River Union now!"

 RIV_river_army:0 "The River Army"
 RIV_river_army_desc:0 "The Riverponies have stood side-by-side against foreign invaders for centuries. Having a unified River Army would help ensure the everlasting safety and security of the Union whilst helping pushing down the cost of defence for our member states."

 RIV_river_government:0 "A United River Government"
 RIV_river_government_desc:0 "It is time to reconsider the sovereignty of the Member State Governments. The River Union has proven way more competent in dealing with issues than the squabbling national governments. We will pressure them into resigning their veto for changing the treaty of Coltstream, effectively remodelling the River Commission into a united River Government."

 RIV_the_federation:0 "The River Federation"
 RIV_the_federation_desc:0 "After years of gradual integration, the River Union now finds itself ready to take the last step towards Federalisation. By revoking the right of secession and officially declaring the River Government the primary authority, the member states of the Coalition will cease to exist as a separate entity on the world stage. A dream for many, the River Federation will rise in their place as a global superpower."

 RIV_pacify_the_north:0 "Pacify the North"
 RIV_pacify_the_north_desc:0 "Some of the Northern ponies have strayed from the path of Harmony. We must intervene to protect the citizens of the north against their own government. The River Federation will not tolerate any threats near its borders."

 RIV_pacify_the_south:0 "Pacify the South"
 RIV_pacify_the_south_desc:0 "Deer, Zebra, Mages. Weird states that should not be there rule the south of the River Federation. We must bring these lands under our protection so that the Federation is safe."

 RIV_atomic_energy_community:0 "Found RIVATOM"
 RIV_atomic_energy_community_desc:0 "We have learned of the wonderful abilities that magical crystals hold. We will fund a federation wide research organisation to study these crystals and make the findings available to the Federal Government."

 #### EVENT ####
 riverfed.1.t:0 "The River Society of Science"
 riverfed.1.d:0 "[From.GetName] has proposed a student exchange program along with a permanent knowledge sharing initiative. This River Society of Science, will help to improve learning throughout the Riverlands. Although the plan would benefit our country, some nationalists are concerned about sharing our technology with foreigners, even if they are our friends."
 riverfed.1.a:0 "A brilliant idea!"
 riverfed.1.b:0 "We will not share our knowledge with anyone."
 
 riverfed.2.t:0 "The River Coal and Steel Community"
 riverfed.2.d:0 "[From.GetName] has proposed a plan they call the River Coal and Steel Community. With it, we will share the base raw materials between our coalition members more fairly and with less competition. An additional idea is to prevent war between members of the coalition by putting control over the resources required for warfare in the hands of a supranational committee. This committee would be chaired by independent experts.\n\nAlthough these plans could improve our economy and many of our citizens sympathise with the idea of stopping warfare between members of the Coalition, giving up control over our resources to some unelected ‘experts’ is an unprecedented step."
 riverfed.2.a:0 "With this, we will secure peace!"
 riverfed.2.b:0 "We refuse to give over sovereignty to this committee."
 
 riverfed.3.t:0 "[From.GetName] has aided our Industry"
 riverfed.3.d:0 "[From.GetName] has built a factory for us to help us along with our industrialisation efforts. With state of the art machines they cleared a large plot of land for development and even funded construction of a new factory. Our citizens are amazed that our friends would help us in such a way."
 riverfed.3.a:0 "A toast to our friends in [From.GetName]!"
 
 riverfed.5.t:0 "[From.GetName] has built Roads for Us"
 riverfed.5.d:0 "[From.GetName] has funded an infrastructure project inside our country. They cited strategic considerations for the entire coalition. Without roads, it would be hard to transport forces through our country against any attack by the states that surround us. Either way, these brand new roads will serve us well."
 riverfed.5.a:0 "Their generosity is truly humbling."
 
 riverfed.7.t:0 "[From.GetName] Has granted us Industrial Aid"
 riverfed.7.d:0 "[From.GetName] has granted us aid to help develop our industrial base. A temporary program of grants, along with a delegation of engineers from [From.GetName] have been sent to help us. The ambassador [From.GetName] said that their country considered helping friends as important as helping themselves and that [From.GetName] truly seek no compensation for their aid."
 riverfed.7.a:0 "Let us not squander this opportunity."
 
 riverfed.8.t:0 "[From.GetName] Has Granted us Industrial Aid"
 riverfed.8.d:0 "[From.GetName], all the way from the Riverlands, has granted us industrial aid. A delegation of their engineers arrived to help us with the construction of new factories. Meanwhile they have also promised us financial aid to develop our country. The government of [From.GetName] has promised that they do this in the name of continued friendship between our nations and that there were no conditions attached to their help."
 riverfed.8.a:0 "Let us make generous use of their assistance."
 
 riverfed.9.t:0 "[From.GetName] has sent a Friendship Delegation"
 riverfed.9.d:0 "A boat arrived today, carrying a delegation from [From.GetName]. After a miscommunication almost led to us shooting at them, the diplomats explain that they have come to establish diplomatic ties and that it was truly the wish of [From.GetName] to be friends with us. Even more, they promise that all their friends in the Riverlands feel the same way and would be delighted to start talking with us!"
 riverfed.9.a:0 "Let us work together for a better world."
 riverfed.9.b:0 "Friends? It must be a tick. Who would ever want to be friends with us?"
 
 riverfed.10.t:0 "[From.GetName] Has Accepted our Friendship Delegation"
 riverfed.10.d:0 "Our delegation to [From.GetName] reports that the changelings actually want to be our friend. It seems that diplomacy and openness truly work wonders. We can now begin to set up diplomatic channels and maybe even trade relations. Let us toast to our new friends!"
 riverfed.10.a:0 "Together, we shall make a world of peace and prosperity."
 
 riverfed.11.t:0 "[From.GetName] Has Rejected our Friendship Delegation"
 riverfed.11.d:0 "[From.GetName] does not want to be our friend, it seemed. They sent our delegation back home and were sceptical of our true motives. It seems that these changelings have a hard time trusting us. The news has been met with disappointment and some citizens are even offended that the islanders turned us down."
 riverfed.11.a:0 "But I thought they liked love?"
 
 riverfed.12.t:0 "[From.GetName] has Invited Us to Join the Treaty of Coltstream"
 riverfed.12.d:0 "We have been invited to join the Treaty of Coltstream, guaranteeing mutual defence in the event of an attack. The treaty, however, seems to be more than just that. The member states work together on all sorts of issues and are looking to intensify this cooperation. We must consider carefully if that is truly the road we want to take."
 riverfed.12.a:0 "Sign the treaty, this is our best shot at preserving peace and harmony."
 riverfed.12.b:0 "We are not interested at this time."
 
 riverfed.13.t:0 "[From.GetName] Has Declined to Join"
 riverfed.13.d:0 "[From.GetName] does not want to join the treaty of Coltstream. In an official statement, the country declared that although they appreciate the values of the Riverlands, they do not see a place for themselves in the treaty just yet. Nevertheless, [From.GetName] has said that their rejection does not have to mean the end of our friendship."
 riverfed.13.a:0 "At least we can still be friends?" 
 
 riverfed.14.t:0 "The River Development Company"
 riverfed.14.d:0 "[From.GetName] has founded the River Development Company. A pan-River government owned corporation to assist in improving infrastructure and industries in the poorest parts of the Riverlands. The chairs of the company have already revealed bold plans to overhaul industry and transportation in the region and they hope for our cooperation."
 riverfed.14.a:0 "What a great idea, we will join this venture!"
 riverfed.14.b:0 "We won't fund this nonsense, we are fine on our own!"

 riverfed.15.t:0 "The River Economic Community"
 riverfed.15.d:0 "[From.GetName] has approached us with an intriguing proposal; the transition of the RSCS into the REC. This is an attempt both to improve relations and boost the economy of both our nations, as well as all the others involved. It also, however, a diplomatic move; one that seeks to bind our nations together.\n\nThe REC, founded by the treaty of [From.Capital.GetName], proposes both reductions to custom duties and the establishment of a customs union, while also making a singular market for goods, labour, services and various other such across the member states. There are plans to expand it; Furthermore, the establishment of the River Commission will provide the means to further these plans; proposing legislation, implementing decisions made, and otherwise upholding the River treaties while upholding the REC's daily dealing.\n If we were to sign up for this then it would begin to benefit us immediately. However, it would also likely create ties with [From.GetName] that cannot be severed in the foreseeable future."
 riverfed.15.a:0 "Cooperation is the key to the future!"
 riverfed.15.b:0 "We will opt-out, this goes too far!"

 riverfed.16.t:0 "The River Social Development Fund"
 riverfed.16.d:0 "[From.GetName] has approached us with further treaties to append to what has already been built on in the REC. They back a River Commission proposal to put in place measures and practices that improve factory conditions not only without hampering workplace efficiency, but rather to streamline the process even more. This might lose us the ability to control our own labour laws, however."
 riverfed.16.a:0 "Our citizens deserve this fund!"
 riverfed.16.b:0 "[From.GetName] should mind their own business!"

 riverfed.17.t:0 "River Convention on Beings Rights"
 riverfed.17.d:0 "[From.GetName] has convened the members of the Community to discuss Beings Rights. Although the majority of those at the table already have a lot of laws in place to protect their citizens against the government, this is not the case everywhere. [From.GetName] wants to make a pan-Riverlands court to oversee a new treaty on Beings Rights. The verdicts made by this court would be enforceable on the countries that sign the treaty. One of the most important parts of the treaty is the ban on slavery and the equality of citizens of all races."
 riverfed.17.a:0 "Let us sign it for our citizens’ sake!"
 riverfed.17.b:0 "This is an unacceptable breach of our sovereignty."

 riverfed.18.t:0 "The River Parliament"
 riverfed.18.d:0 "It was inevitable that with all the powers granted to the River Commission, there would be a call for more democratic control at the pan-River level. [From.GetName] has championed the cause for a River Parliament which would be a counterweight to the unelected Commission. The proponents of this parliament hope that this will result more sensible and popular policies, while ensuring the will of the people."
 riverfed.18.a:0 "We must allow our citizens a say in pan-River affairs!"
 riverfed.18.b:0 "We already have representation at the national level."

 riverfed.19.t:0 "A Free Movement Area"
 riverfed.19.d:0 "A radical proposal was brought up in a meeting by the permanent representative of [From.GetName]. They proposed that a free movement area should be realised between the member states of the Community. That would mean abolishing border controls in our internal borders and losing control of what comes into our country. This would come with several other reforms, like police cooperation to catch cross-border criminals. Although connecting our peoples together is a good thing, a border was always considered a sign of national sovereignty. Should we part with our borders?"
 riverfed.19.a:0 "If money can flow freely, so should our citizens!"
 riverfed.19.b:0 "Our border guards stay!"

 riverfed.20.t:0 "The River Central Bank"
 riverfed.20.d:0 "The increasingly interdependent economies of the Riverlands lack serious oversight in monetary matters. In reality, the smaller national banks usually just follow the lead of those in the larger economies. [From.GetName] has proposed to end this and ensure that all member states can equally talk about monetary policy, by making that a pan-Riverland task. A new Central Bank will be made, which will oversee the national central banks. This bank will be almost completely independent from the River Commission and national governments. It would massively improve what we can do with our economy, but these breaches of national sovereignty are starting to become pretty severe..."
 riverfed.20.a:0 "Let us formalise the cooperation that already existed!"
 riverfed.20.b:0 "Our country, our rules!"

 riverfed.21.t:0 "The Rivbit"
 riverfed.21.d:0 "For time immemorial, coins have been used as a symbol of national control, a way to spread the ideas of a government to the citizens of the nation. However, a small economy has a hard time keeping a stable currency. With the borders opened and the economies connected, [From.GetName] has pushed for a single currency, the Rivbit. This would solve problems for many companies and tourists who cross the borders often. It would be a big sign of unity and trust in the pan-River government to have a currency-union."
 riverfed.21.a:0 "The Rivbit will be a stable currency for us all!"
 riverfed.21.b:0 "I want my head printed on our own coins."

 riverfed.22.t:0 "The River Union" 
 riverfed.22.d:0 "[From.GetName] has called another conference to revise the treaty. They argued that the increased responsibility of the Commission, the parliament and the single currency all show that the Community is more than an economic construct. After a long time of negotiation, the many laws and treaties that came before have been untangled into a new treaty, the treaty of [From.Capital.GetName]. Much of the informal powers of the Commission and the River Parliament have now been formalised and if approved, the River Union would be a very powerful organisation, one which we will not be able to sidestep easily.\n\nProtests have been organised in our capital both for and against the treaty, as our citizens are becoming increasingly aware about what is actually happening in the Riverlands. Some of our citizens have even called for an all-out federation, while others want a roll back on pan-River powers. Regardless of if we ratify the treaty or not, this question will surely stay as a divisive issue for the foreseeable future."
 riverfed.22.a:0 "The Union Forever!"
 riverfed.22.b:0 "They want what? No, we must decline."

 riverfed.23.t:0 "The River Army"
 riverfed.23.d:0 "[From.GetName] wants to set another step towards centralisation. The armies of the Union members will be put under a centralised command structure. We have always been coordinating our armed forces together with our friends, but this would formalise a hierarchy in which the army is under Union control. The savings of centralising the army will be enormous and there is a lot we can still learn from our friends. On the other hand, the proposal has met with outrage amongst some of our officers and a significant part of the population. An army is the one thing that defines a state. If we lose control of our army, could we still be called a nation?"
 riverfed.23.a:0 "What are they afraid of? This will save money!"
 riverfed.23.b:0 "They will never take our country’s pride!"

 riverfed.24.t:0 "Centralising the River Government"
 riverfed.24.d:0 "Some have awaited this day eagerly, while others dreaded it. [From.GetName] has put a proposal on the table which is frankly, preposterous. Or it should be. It will push the power to change the treaties away from our government and the other countries and put it in the hands of the River Commission and the River Parliament. This will in effect mean that we will be unable to stop decisions by these institutions and that leaving will be nigh impossible.\n\nNormally such a proposal would be rejected outright, but the River Union has given us so many benefits, and we stand to gain much more from this reform. However, our government must ask itself if it would really sign a law to make itself obsolete. We have come so far and enjoyed so many of the benefits of cooperation, do we really even want to be separated from our friends anymore?"
 riverfed.24.a:0 "They left us no choice but to accept."
 riverfed.24.b:0 "There is still a way back!"

 riverfed.25.t:0 "The River Federation"
 riverfed.25.d:0 "[From.GetName] has done much to bring the River Union to the place it is today. Many of our institutions are there and it is unsurprising that they are the ones who have been pushing for the River Federation. Informally, surprisingly little would change as most affairs are handled by the Union anyway. Formally, however, we’d renounce our right to leave the Union and give the Federation the prime authority of government and say over our army. If we agree to the Federation, it will be the Federal Government which decides what things our government can do, instead of us controlling the Union Government. Of course, banding together like this will make us a formidable power, and surely no one could ever threaten us again.\n\nMany question, however, if our original dream hasn’t turned into a nightmare. Are we not on the verge of losing what made us [Root.GetAdjective] in the first place? We have to make a decision that will decide the future of our children and maybe the future of Griffonia as a whole."
 riverfed.25.a:0 "We will join the Federation!"
 riverfed.25.b:0 "This is a step too far, but we shall stay in the Union."
 riverfed.25.c:0 "[From.GetName] is trying to take us over, we must leave!"

 riverfed.26.t:0 "[From.GetName] Joins the Federation"
 riverfed.26.d:0 "[From.GetName] has decided to join the Federation! Their country will be integrated into the federation, ensuring a peaceful and stable future."
 riverfed.26.a:0 "Forward together!"

 riverfed.27.t:0 "[From.GetName] Doesn't Want Full Membership"
 riverfed.27.d:0 "[From.GetName has decided that they do not want to take part in the Federation. However, they are happy with staying in the Union on the terms we decided on equally, as long as they can keep their independence. This is a setback, but our institutions will still be able to control a lot of their decisions and we will still be able to protect them."
 riverfed.27.a:0 "We can work with this."

 riverfed.28.t:0 "[From.GetName] Leaves the Union!"
 riverfed.28.d:0 "[From.GetName] has announced that they are activating the secession protocol made into the original treaty of Coltstream. They will be negotiating their way out of the Union, reverting back to normal relations. They will surely be missed, but it appears that we have no choice but to let our friends go for now."
 riverfed.28.a:0 "Is there nothing we can do?"

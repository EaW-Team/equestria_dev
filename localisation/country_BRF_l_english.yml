#CHARACTER DESCRIPTIONS & ADVISORS
BRF_Kloseu_desc:0 "King Kloseu de Kissau is the first ruler of the Kingdom of Brodfeld. He became the Prince of Brodfeld in 963 ALB and was elected Domnitor (ruling prince) of Kivessin and Sydia in 965 ALB. In 973 ALB, when the Griffonian Empire was falling apart, Kloseu declared independence and claimed the title of King of Brodfeld. He was crowned in the Grand Temple of Eviliana in Kivessin by Prelate Denali.\n\nDuring his rule Brodfeld grew wealthier and became known as the ricebasket of Griffonia, yet blight caused the Great Famine in 995 ALB. After the economic crisis of the new millenium, Kloseu declared a state of emergency in 1001 ALB which granted him autocratic powers and cracked down on any disorder and dissent, restoring stability in Brodfeld.\n\nThe peace was brief, however, as in 1003 ALB an assassination attempt was made on him while he was spectating a military parade in Kivessin with his wife. He was merely wounded on his cheek, but his wife died in his embrace. Afterwards he blamed communists and banned all communist organizations, yet members of PCP resisted arrest, formed the GLA and rebelled. The civil war began."
BRF_Kloseu_fasc_desc:0 "King Kloseu de Kissau has become Autocrat of All Prywhen, the undisputed ruler of Brodfeld with nigh-unlimited powers. The military and the members of the fanatical Golden Guard are unquestionably loyal to him, while those who oppose him know their doom is near. The griffons of Prywhen simply call him 'Conducator', Leader, the chosen one of goddess Eviliana and their mighty master."
BRF_our_king:0 "King Kloseu de Kissau"
BRF_our_king_desc:0 "In a miraculous turn of events, the King has listened to reason and has written a new constitution, relinquishing most of his powers to a democratically elected Senate and turning into little more than a figurehead of the nation. He now spends most of his time in his secluded manor on the Evi river and goes fishing every day."
BRF_Enrico:0 "Enrico Chivaldori"
BRF_Enrico_leader_desc:0 "Enrico Chivaldori is a son of a Wingbardian migrant and has lived in Sydia his whole life. He has had a passion for music his entire life and is a talented violin player. Over his life he has worked as a music teacher and a conductor before finally entering politics and joining PNL. He is a supporter of democracy and harmony and a close friend of Prince Tomado who shares his liberal ideals. He was among the thousands of griffons who Kloseu banished from the country for being supporters of dangerous ideas but the Prince convinced his father to pardon him. A calm, reasonable speaker, he managed to get elected Prime Minister (possibly with some help from his royal friend) and now leads the government of Brodfeld."
BRF_Prelate:0 "Prelate Denali"
BRF_Prelate_desc:0 "Prelate Denali is an ancient griffon, rivaling Archon Eros in age. He has seen Prywhen be united and go through hard times of great suffering. Always has he been aiding those in need, the poor and downtrodden of society who find salvation in religion. To him, communists are monsters who wish to destroy the world as we know it and doom the souls of griffons by abandoning their Gods."

BRF_Mason_Of_Kivessin:0 "Mason of Kivessin"
BRF_Tomado:0 "Prince Tomado de Kissau"
BRF_Tomado_desc:0 "Tomado de Kissau is King Kloseu's only son and legitimate heir. He is an idealistic griffon in his early twenties who lost his mother when an assassination attempt was made on his father. He has been influenced by liberal ideals, mostly thanks to his close friend Enrico Chivaldori, and wishes for Brodfeld to become a constitutional monarchy. His father's recent cruelty and despotism made him worried and afraid."

BRF_Constan_Pryzan:0 "Constanti Privezan"
BRF_Walrus_desc:0 "§gBorn in 966 ALB, Sycle was once one of the many peasants on the countryside, living in one of the many unknown villages. Having lived on the border near the Gryphian Host, he had faced one of the raids done by the Cossacks as a child. Having witnessed their immense speed at which they flew, agility of their moves and determination on their faces, this shaped the childhood of Sycle's life. He eagerly studied many wars of the past, and enlisted at the local garrison as soon as he became 18. Year after year of eager and loyal service saw him soon promoted to an officer, and later, a general. To him, the fact that a lowly peasant could rise to the rank of a General, proved him that the current system was indeed, fair and just, for all those willing to work for their future. After the attempted assassination of the King in 1003 ALB, he was one of the many officers involved in the arrests and executions of various socialist groups. Deeply loyal, he will follow the King to the Gates of Tartarus itself.§!"

#ECONOMY
BRF_reopen_ports:0 "Reopen The Port Of Sydia"
BRF_reopen_ports_desc:0 "The old capital of the Principality of Sydia has always been the largest and busiest port in Prywhen. The war, however, made foreign traders abandon it and forced us to conscript many of the local fishergriffs. Now that peace and order have been restored, merchants and fishers can get back to business! We will repair the port, lower trade tariffs and ease taxation on fish markets, thus helping our economy recover."
BRF_qwoptia_wood:0 "Lifov Forestry"
BRF_qwoptia_wood_desc:0 "Out of all the myriad materials needed for the reconstruction effort, wood stands above all else. By investing in sawmills and nationalizing the forestry companies of Crowoia and Qwoptia we can begin mass production of cheap yet versatile lumber. And after the reconstruction is over, we will have a strong forest industry ready to make profit!"
BRF_nasom_dam:0 "White Flower's N.A.S.O.M. Dam"
BRF_nasom_dam_desc:0 "Mason of Sydia has approached us with intriguing plans for a project he called N.A.S.O.M.(National Action to Secure Our Modernization): The construction of a hydroelectric dam on the Pry river which will be able to produce many megawatts of energy. While it may be difficult, expensive and time-consuming to build, Mason says he will take care of everything as long as we provide workers."
#
BRF_rice_fields:0 "Fields Of Gold"
BRF_rice_fields_desc:0 "Decades ago, Brodfeld was the ricebasket of Griffonia. However, this reliance on rice caused the Great Famine of 995 ALB after blight struck (Communist claims that the famine was the fault of the King's policies is pure propaganda). It is time to restore the golden fields of old! We shall redistribute farmland confiscated from the reds and give wheat, barley and oat seeds to the new owners."
BRF_prosperity:0 "Live In Prosperity"
BRF_prosperity_desc:0 "With foreign merchant ships arriving in Sydia, fishers catching fish in the Bay of Salt, our unemployed conscripted to work on the White Flower dam and houses being rebuilt with lumber from Lifov, we are quickly beginning to recover. Much work remains to be done, but the seeds have been planted, and from them golden flowers shall sprout and eventually bloom."
BRF_river_ferry:0 "Evi River Ferry"
BRF_river_ferry_desc:0 "Communist sabotage might've ruined most of our regular roads, but the watery highways of nature are invincible: Rivers! While our corvée labourers repair the road network, we will invest in ferries and river patrols. This should ensure regular and safe traffic along the great and holy Evi River."
BRF_new_schools:0 "New Schools Across the Nation"
BRF_new_schools_desc:0 "Prelate Denali and the clergy are grateful to us for saving them from godless communists, who wished to eradicate religion and create a secular state. Therefore they are more than willing to cooperate with us in the education of our populace. We shall establish temple schools, where our ignorant subjects are taught to read, count and respect Gods and Kings!"
BRF_develop_oil:0 "Repair Our Oil Wells"
BRF_develop_oil_desc:0 "The Terrible Marsh is a cursed land, inhabited mostly by tribal griffons and magical monsters. But it is far from worthless, as beneath the marshes lie vast oil deposits. The wells were badly damaged during the war, but with funds from our recovering economy, we can invest in repairing them."
BRF_sydacute_highway:0 "Royal Sydia-Temsoar Road"
BRF_sydacute_highway_desc:0 "Our progress in repairing damaged roads has gone well. So well, in fact, that we could start building new ones! We have plans for a wide, paved road from Sydia to the isolated mining town of Temsoar. The way will have to be cut through the thick Acute Forest, but there's nothing our stout corvée labourers can't overcome."
BRF_kivsydia_railway:0 "Royal Kivessin-Sydia Railway"
BRF_kivsydia_railway_desc:0 "Another infrastructure project we will begin in our blessed King's honour is the Kivessin-Sydia railway, first of its kind in Prywhen. While the Evi river already provides an excellent route of transportation, there is no doubt that modern trains are much faster than ferries and have higher capacity. This shall be a sign of a new, modern age in Prywhen!"
BRF_rice_cooking:0 "\"100 Ways To Make Bread\""
BRF_rice_cooking_desc:0 "Royal printing presses in Sydia, Larios and Kivessin have been tasked with printing hundreds of thousands of copies of a new book, written by the finest culinary minds in Prywhen. It will explain in detail how to make various types of bread from a variety of crops. The guide will contain illustrations and simple writing that our farmers can read with ease."
BRF_hire_miners:0 "Hire Workers For Temsoar Mines"
BRF_hire_miners_desc:0 "Many miners of Temsoar joined the communists during the civil war and never returned home. As a result, the mines are in sore need of more labourers which we must provide. Few skills are required, so we can easily hire many unemployed and impoverished griffons who lost everything in the war. We will pay them decent wages to compensate for the great danger of being a miner, of course."
BRF_kivessin_university:0 "Beacon Of Civilization"
BRF_kivessin_university_desc:0 "The capital of the Principality of Kivessin, now the capital of the Kingdom of Brodfeld, should once again become the most civilized city in the realm. The King shall welcome our intelligentsia back home, ensuring them that Prywhen is now safe, and invite foreign teachers as well. Emissaries from abroad will surely be impressed by our sophistication! As long as they don't leave the city limits, that is."
BRF_print_books:0 "More Textbooks, Less Propaganda"
BRF_print_books_desc:0 "Our cookbook campaign has proved to be a success, therefore it is clear we must print more educational and informative textbooks instead of just propaganda! Libraries shall be built across the country and crammed with knowledge-filled books which our students can use for a low cost."
BRF_yearly_fair:0 "Yearly Science Fairs"
BRF_yearly_fair_desc:0 "Mason of Twelt has proposed that we establish a yearly science fair. Our students will form teams and work together on a science project which they shall then present at the fair. The most ground-breaking presentation will receive a Royal Award. This will not only allow us to find talented griffons, but will also popularize science and motivate our students." 
BRF_concrete_building:0 "Reinforced Concrete"
BRF_concrete_building_desc:0 "While concrete has been used in Prywhen for centuries, Mason of Sydia says that mass-production of steel allows us to adopt superior reinforced concrete. With it, even the sky is not the limit when building new constructions! No longer shall earthquakes make our houses and bridges collapse. New standards and regulations will ensure the correct production and use of this miraculous composite material."
BRF_mason_special:0 "Finished Dam"
BRF_mason_special_desc:0 "White Flower's new dam is nearing completion and will be officially opened in a grand ceremony which the King himself will attend. The N.A.S.O.M. project has been a groundbreaking success! Thousands of homes and dozens of factories will be powered by the dam."
BRF_new_excavation:0 "Modern Tools"
BRF_new_excavation_desc:0 "Steam-powered tools are effective, but they must be replaced with new, better tools powered by fuel and electricity. One modern worker can accomplish more than ten backwards workers in the same amount of time! Contracts with Wingbardy will ensure an ample supply of tools of the new age."

#CIVIL WAR
BRF_start_cw:0 "For King And Country!"
BRF_start_cw_desc:0 "Our beloved Kingdom has been engulfed in the savage storm of civil war. The red tide wishes to drown us and destroy everything we hold dear. They want to take away our lands, our workshops and our homes. No one except their party will own anything. They are no more than robber rabble, as bad as the wicked bandits of Blackrock. King Kloseu, lead your griffons to victory and salvation! May Eviliana guide you!"
BRF_army_unemployed:0 "Conscript The Unemployed"
BRF_army_unemployed_desc:0 "The decade-long economic crisis and the civil war have left hundreds of thousands of griffons unemployed, loitering around in our cities and towns. We should put them to work -- by giving them guns and basic training. They should be thankful, for is there any duty more noble than the slaughter of communist scum?"
BRF_equip_workers:0 "Arm The Workers"
BRF_equip_workers_desc:0 "Desperate times call for desperate measures. While so far workers in factories and workshops have been contributing to our war effort indirectly, we now need their more direct aid from them. While the husbands go to the front, their wives and children shall replace them in the factories. All of our griffons, no matter the age or gender, must unite to fight against the blight of communism!"
BRF_every_beak:0 "Every Beak Counts"
BRF_every_beak_desc:0 "We have no option. The communists are coming, ready to rape and slaughter. In our darkest hour everyone must fight! Those who cannot be given guns will arm themselves with tools and boldly charge against the accursed foe. May Arcturius give us all strength with which to smite our wicked foe! Long live the King! Long live Brodfeld! Long live Prywhen! Forward, with the help of Gods!"
BRF_calm_winds:0 "Calm The Winds"
BRF_calm_winds_desc:0 "Our nation is in disarray, with untold masses of griffons fleeing the country to Cyanolisia, Lushi, Gryphus or even Gryphia. With food running out, crime and riots are commonplace in the cities while roving bands of red bandits loot and burn the deserted countryside. It is time to begin a propaganda campaign, where our King will persuade the griffons to remain calm and carry on."
BRF_mobility_key:0 "Mobility Is The Key"
BRF_mobility_key_desc:0 "It is clear that new, fuel-powered vehicles will revolutionize warfare. Perhaps this is the edge we need to win the war. As soon as possible, we must begin production of trucks that can quickly transport our troops where they are needed."
BRF_not_here:0 "Not Here. Not Now."
BRF_not_here_desc:0 "We do not have an infinite pool of griffonpower to draw from. Keeping this in mind, we must ensure that the wounded don't always die and that camp epidemics are kept to a minimum. Specialized field hospital companies would accomplish these things well."
BRF_clear_commands:0 "Clear Commands"
BRF_clear_commands_desc:0 "Our army still uses flags, banners, drums and trumpets to communicate and relay orders, which sometimes results in confusion. In 1006 ALB almost a hundred royal soldiers died after a communication error. This must never happen again. We will acquire radios from Wingbardy and introduce modern communication to our military."
BRF_mic_check:0 "Testing, Testing, 1, 2, 3."
BRF_mic_check_desc:0 "Now that the Royal Army is beginning to use radios, we can proceed to organize specialized communication companies. This will greatly improve the performance of our divisions on the battlefield."
BRF_temporal_carrot:0 "Tighten The Belt"
BRF_temporal_carrot_desc:0 "The nobility of the nation still has a good amount of food in their storages which they are unwilling to give to their peasants. Their greed will not be tolerated in this time of crisis! We will send soldiers to confiscate food and give it to those in need. Any arguments that the King should give away his food as well will be dismissed. His Majesty must remain well-fed and healthy."
BRF_war_council:0 "Expand The Royal Laboratory"
BRF_war_council_desc:0 "Thanks to a decade-long economic crisis and years of civil war, most of our intelligentsia has fled the country, considerably slowing down our research and development and thus hindering our war effort. Mason of Twelt wishes to address this issue and has proposed the expansion of the secret laboratory under the Royal Palace, so all our scientists can safely work there together with generous royal funding."

BRF_high_command:0 "Military High Command"
BRF_high_command_desc:0 "The meeting of our officers proved what a boon centralized cooperation can be. It is time we reform our army, form a high command and reduce the independence of officers.

BRF_supply_logistics:0 "Modern Logistics"
BRF_supply_logistics_desc:0 "Logistics win wars, not guns or soldiers. And sadly our logistics are primitive, with our soldiers relying on foraging (a nice way to say "pillaging and robbing") to supply themselves.

BRF_ease_conscription:0 "Ease Conscription"
BRF_ease_conscription_desc:0 "These hard times of war take a toll on our griffons, especially those who are forced to serve in the Royal Army.

BRF_strengthen_royalty:0 "Codify Emergency Powers"
BRF_strengthen_royalty_desc:0 "After the famine in 995 and the following unrest, the King declared a state of emergency which granted him nigh-unlimited powers.

### BRODFELD EVENTS ####

brodfeld_rework.1.t:0 "Work For The Unemployed!"
brodfeld_rework.1.d:0 "Our police forces in cities and the local militia in towns have gathered an impressive crowd of unemployed and idle griffons, who have been given a basic training in using guns, fighting in formation and following orders. Most of them grasped the basics, and that is good enough for we have no time or resources for anything more. Now we will send them to the front and hope the communists are terrified by our sudden increase in numbers!"
brodfeld_rework.1.a:0 "Onwards, to a brighter future!"
brodfeld_rework.1.b:0 "Get 2 divisions of Brodfeld's unemployed in our capital, Kivessin"

brodfeld_rework.2.t:0 "Put Away The Worktools!"
brodfeld_rework.2.d:0 "Tens of thousands of our factory workers bid farewell to their loved ones today as they begin their march to the front. They, too, have received only the most basic training in this dire time, but with the blessings of Arcturius and Eviliana they will fight like true soldiers. Each draftee was given a portrait of the King to inspire them and to remind them of where their loyalty lies.\n\nNow their relatives, unfit for combat, have started working in the factories. They lack work experience and often have children to take care of. Nevertheless, it is still better than having the workshops remain silent."
brodfeld_rework.2.a:0 "A tactical necessity."
brodfeld_rework.2.b:0 "Get 2 divisions of Brodfeld's workers in our capital, Kivessin"

brodfeld_rework.3.t:0 "In The Name Of The King, Defend Our Lands!"
brodfeld_rework.3.d:0 "Thousands upon thousands of civilians have been armed, though we have nowhere near enough resources to give them all even basic training. We have no alternative but to simply throw these elders, cripples, mothers and children into battle. It is our last and perhaps only hope to push back the red tide! Yet our griffons are not afraid, for death in battle is preferable to life under communism!\n\nKing Kloseu himself appeared in public for the first time in months, wary of red assassins lurking in the shadows and nervously glancing around him. Yet he mustered his courage and appeared on stage in the central square, which was packed full of griffons who had mere weeks ago been innocent civilians. To ensure everyone could hear the King, a Wingbardian microphone and a loudspeaker had been placed on stage, one of the only ones in Prywhen and as expensive as a mansion. Kloseu approached the microphone, cleared his throat and spoke.\n\n"My dear subjects! You all must know that I would not force you to fight if the situation was not most dire and desperate. Indeed it is, for communist scum have beaten back our armies and are approaching us, eager to loot, burn and pillage. Do you now understand? You will be forced to fight no matter what; Be thankful I have given you guns to defend yourself and your families with."\n\nSuddenly Kloseu's purple eyes lit up with fury."And if any of you think otherwise, that the communist filth are liberators and bringers of peace and prosperity, I will say to you: What utter fools you are! They care for nought but creating their utopia no matter the cost. Otherwise, would have they ruined our country? Would have their burned our fields? Would have they murdered their brothers for staying loyal to me? Would have they murdered my gentle and loving wife?!"\n\nKloseu was panting heavily, a tear flowing down his cheek into his scar. "Trust me, my brave subjects, you will receive no mercy from those barbarians. Give them none in return! Now onwards, to the barricades! Defend your homes and families at all costs! And do not fear death, for Arcturius is waiting for you all in the afterlife!"\n\nFor the first time in a decade, a huge crowd was cheering for Kloseu and chanting his name. He smiled, proud of his griffons."
brodfeld_rework.3.a:0 "May Eviliana help us all!"
brodfeld_rework.3.b:0 "We conscripted everyone we found..."

brodfeld_rework.4.t:0 "A Deep Plan"
brodfeld_rework.4.d:0 "Our military officers met in a tent on a rainy night and discussed until daybreak. Many ideas and suggestions were shared, yet most of them were deemed impractical, overly ambitious or simply moronic. In the end, though, one plan emerged: Requesting foreign assistance.\n\nWhile some officers such as Lexandru were too proud to admit it, we are weak alone, with our economy in tatters and the enemy controlling half the country. Yet we don't have to be alone. Surely, foreign nations will recognize the threat of Redglad's radical revolution and send us immediate aid. We can especially look to Wingbardy, for the Talonuel dynasty is an old friend of the de Kissaus and will certainly help us in our darkest hour. For us to receive any aid from them, we must hold the port of Sydia at all costs."
brodfeld_rework.4.a:0 "Send a messenger to Karthin and pray to Boreas."
brodfeld_rework.4.b:0 "§RThe state of Sydia must remain in our control for us to receive aid from Wingbardy§!\n"

brodfeld_rework.5_t_success:0 "A Gift From Garibald!"
brodfeld_rework.5_d_success:0 "A ship from Wingbardy arrived in the harbour of Sydia today! Our griffons greeted the foreign sailors joyously as dozens of containers filled with modern rifles and equipment were unloaded from the vessel. Their captain told our harbourmaster that it was a "Gift from his majesty" and wished us luck with winning the war. Boreas bless Garibald!"
brodfeld_rework.5.a:0 "We are deeply grateful!"

brodfeld_rework.5_t_fail:0 "A Missed Opportunity"
brodfeld_rework.5_d_fail:0 "Our scouts informed us today that a foreign merchant ship was seen off the coast, flying the colours of Wingbardy. It approached our port, but when the communists fired warning shots it turned around and sailed back home. We will never know what the ship was bringing to us."
brodfeld_rework.5.b:0 "Boreas has abandoned us..."

brodfeld_rework.6.t:0 "When The Winged Knights Arrived!"
brodfeld_rework.6.d:0 "The rigorous and extensive training program is complete and Operation: Violet is declared a success. Thousands of elite warriors now stand ready to serve their King, clad in shining gilded armour and wielding the finest weapons in the Kingdom. They are strong, fearless, utterly loyal to Kloseu and ready to die for him in glorious battle."
brodfeld_rework.6.a:0 "Death from above make our enemy kneel!"
brodfeld_rework.6.b:0 "This will spawn two divisions of §YKnights.§!"

brodfeld_rework.7.t:0 "Price of Freedom"
brodfeld_rework.7.d:0 "Prywhen has been saved from the tyranny of communism and the liberty of its griffons is, for now, safe and secure. But victory has come at a terrible cost, for the country lies in ruins, thousands lay dead and most educated Prywhenians live as refugees abroad. Therefore, it is not odd to witness apathy on the streets even as news of triumph spread. For most commoners, the end of the war makes little difference to their miserable and impoverished lives as they bury their loved ones and continue their daily struggle to survive.\n\nNevertheless, the King had ordered a military parade to be held in Kivessin, hoping to lift the spirits of his subjects. Many griffons attended, only to witness rows upon rows of underequipped and underfed soldiers marching in poor order while military bands played overly pompous music. The golden standards of Brodfeld they carried were torn and dirty. Prince Tomado, who watched the parade with his father, couldn't help but feel that the banners symbolized Prywhen itself."
brodfeld_rework.7.a:0 "The wounds of Prywhen must be healed..."

brodfeld_rework.9.t:0 "The Second Hunt"
brodfeld_rework.9.d:0 "To ensure the stability and integrity of Brodfeld, our soldiers and militiagriffons have arrested anyone suspected of being a supporter of PCP, GLA or any other communist or socialist organization. Often, family members of suspects were detained as well, regardless of their age. Last time this was attempted it ended up sparking a civil war, but now the strength of the reds has been shattered and they are unable to resist.\n\nThousands of new prisoners have been brought to already cramped prison camps across the nation, with the largest ones being in Larios and White Flower which hold tens of thousands of prisoners of war. Everyone will remain detained until each individual's role in the Civil War has been thoroughly investigated. Those who took up arms and fought will certainly be convicted of treason and thus receive harsh sentences.\n\nDeath rates are high as malnutrition and disease ravage the crowded camps. Countless griffons are executed each day without trial. Mass graves near the camps fill quickly."
brodfeld_rework.9.a:0 "I have brought peace, freedom, justice and security to my Kingdom."

brodfeld_rework.58.t:0 "Day of Judgement"
brodfeld_rework.58.d:0 "The captured leaders of GLA were the first to face trial. The King himself, along with his son Tomado, travelled to White Flower's prison camp to witness the proceedings. The suspects, in face of overwhelming evidence, were all convicted guilty of high treason and were sentenced to die. While initially they were to be hanged, His Majesty barked in anger that they deserved a harsher punishment and demanded their impalement, which shocked everyone, especially the convicts and the Prince. Kloseu himself had banned impalement some years after the Kingdom was founded, but it seems he had changed his mind about the matter since.\n\nGeneral Ion Soimescu ordered his hesitant soldiers to obey at once. While the whereabouts of the devil Filip Redglad are unknown, his second-in-command Richard Spear had been captured and was the first to be executed. Before his impalement he mockingly saluted the King and said "Long live the revolution!". One by one the traitors were killed. Cynthia, Brandon, Koldvin. The last convict, Theresa, glanced at the Prince, her eyes distraught with terror. The Prince gave her a pitiful sigh in return and averted her gaze.\n\nAs soldiers carried her to the sharpened iron pike, she managed to get loose from their grasp and ran to Tomado. She fell on her knees in front of him. "I beg you, Prince, I know your father is a stranger to mercy, but surely you're better than him! I don't claim to be innocent, but I repent and beg for forgiveness! If you pardon me, I swear to never betray my country again!"\n\nIon Soimescu immediately pulled out his pistol and was ready to shoot her before Tomado stepped in front of him. He turned to his furious father and said "She genuinely regrets her actions and asks for a royal pardon. If you do not give her a chance, then I no longer wish to be an heir to such a cruel and tyrannical griffon."\n\nKloseu silently glared at his only child in both surprise and anger, his fists clenched.\n\n"Fine," he spat out. "She shall live. For now"."
brodfeld_rework.58.a:0 "She has one chance to redeem herself..."

brodfeld_rework.8.t:0 "The Deportation"
brodfeld_rework.8.d:0 "Unlike the purge of communists, the banishment of democrats received less support among our subjects. Members of the Golden Guard on the other claw strongly agreed with the King and used the opportunity to spread anti-democratic propaganda. They justified the exile by drawing parallels to Aquileia, where democrats plotted with socialists and communists to overthrow the Discret dynasty via violent revolution. Clearly, the exile was a necessary action to secure peace in Prywhen.\n\nPrince Tomado travelled to Sydia, accompanied by a small group of royal guards. The crowded harbour was filled with deportees and ships ready to carry them abroad to countries such as Sicameon and Gryphus. With hasty steps, he went to the ship headed to Wingbardy and was greeted by soldiers.\n\n"Greetings. What brings you here, Prince?"\n\n"I must find a griffon called Enrico Chivaldori. At once."\n\nThe soldiers nodded and obeyed; one read the passenger register while another went into the crowd, shouting the name. Eventually Enrico was found and brought before Tomado. He was wearing a black suit and his signature hat, and carried a suitcase with all of his belongings. When he saw the Prince, his eyes widened.\n\n"Tom? What brings you here? I was just about to board the ship!"\n\n"You're not going anywhere, friend." Tomado gave one of the soldiers a letter with a golden royal seal. He opened it and read it aloud: "I, King Kloseu de Kissau of Brodfeld, hereby grant a royal pardon to Enrico Chivaldori."\n\nEnrico opened his mouth in shock. "What? H-how...?"\n\nThe Prince smiled warmly. "Had to argue with my father for an hour to get him to sign this. You can stay, Rico.""
brodfeld_rework.8.a:0 "Friends are always there for you."

brodfeld_rework.12.t:0 "The Meeting"
brodfeld_rework.12.d:0 "The Prince took a deep breath and knocked on the door of his father's office. Never before had he been courageous enough to tell his father what he truly thought of him, but recent events had changed that.\n\n"Come in," said his father, so he entered. The King was frowning, as he had always been since his wife had been assassinated. "What do you want now? Another royal pardon for another traitor?"\n\n"No. I wanted to tell you what I think about everything that has happened in recent years."\n\nKloseu rolled his eyes. "Fine. Be quick. I have a royal banquet to plan."\n\nTomado sighed, closed his eyes and spoke. "Father, I cannot help but feel like everything was ultimately caused by you. The famine was caused by your trade policy, the assassination of my mother was caused by you assuming dictatorial powers and the civil war was caused by you hunting the communists, even though the griffon responsible for the assassination had been shot and killed immediately. You were hunting innocents for no reason, so they rebelled."\n\nKloseu's purple eyes burned with anger, the scar on his cheek twisting as he grimaced. "How dare you? How dare you say things like that?!" He stood up and slammed his fist on the table. Tomado was startled, but quickly regained his composure.\n\n"Father, I am sorry, but I felt like I had to tell you my honest opinion. You keep trying to do things right but you keep failing and hurting our griffons, which only makes you worse. After the... impalements, I wasn't sure if I even wanted to call you father anymore. It's as if a changeling had taken his place. What would my mother say if she saw you now? Don't you think you've gone too far?!"\n\nHis Majesty calmed himself and sat down on his chair. He stared into nothingess silently while Tomado wiped a tear from his cheek.\n\n"You are bold, son, for speaking against your father like that. Very bold indeed. But...""
brodfeld_rework.12.a:0 ""...You are right.""
brodfeld_rework.12.b:0 "Brodfeld will reform into a constitutional monarchy!"
brodfeld_rework.12.c:0 ""...I forgive you, this time. Now begone! I have much work to do.""
brodfeld_rework.12.e:0 "Brodfeld will reform into a militaristic absolute monarchy..."

brodfeld_rework.10.t:0 "A Royal Dinner"
brodfeld_rework.10.d:0 "Today a grand banquet was held in Kivessin's Royal Palace. Visitors arrived from all over Prywhen and beyond, with members of every noble house attending along with foreign dignitaries. In addition, a surprisingly large number of military officers attended, many of whom were notable members of the Golden Guard. The King greeted everyone personally, shaking their claws as their entered, his son standing beside him. The King smiled, yet Tomado's gaze was absent and he barely spoke.\n\nThe dinner's program consisted of a six course meal (which the King especially enjoyed), a musical performance conducted by the Wingbardian-Brodfeldian maestro Enrico Chivaldori, an hour of dancing and a five course meal (which the King also enjoyed). After the sun had set, the King held a speech as the guests enjoyed the finest Sicameon wine.\n\n"My dear friends! I hope you have all enjoyed my banquet. Let this be a sign to you all that a new age of bliss and prosperity has begun in Brodfeld! Indeed, if it wasn't for our brave soldiers, we would not be standing here right now. Their brave sacrifices and their determination to save our country from godless communists impress even Arcturius Himself. Therefore this feast is held in their honour! In my warriors of gold I can trust, for I know they will defend Prywhen from without and within for many years to come."\n\nKloseu's burning violet eyes were especially focused on the foreigners and the nobles.\n\n"Let he who conspires to destroy Brodfeld know that we will not give in easily! A baptism of fire have we survived and it has made us strong. Nothing shall break our Kingdom! Long live Brodfeld! Eviliana watches over us!"\n\nKloseu pounded his chest with his fist, then raised it high. When the officers in the audience saw this, they did the same and shouted "Hail Kloseu! Long live the King! Long live Brodfeld!". The other visitors appeared uncomfortable, especially the foreigners, and the Prince left the room with hasty steps."
brodfeld_rework.10.a:0 "Brodfeld shall prevail!"

brodfeld_rework.11.t:0 "A New Beginning"
brodfeld_rework.11.d:0 "The King finally appeared in public today and declared he had an announcement to make. A large, curious crowd gathered in front of his palace to hear what he had to say. When he finally came to the balcony and greeted his subjects, he was accompanied by his son Tomado.\n\n"Griffons of Prywhen! Long have you suffered under my rule, and at last I am willing to admit it. I am no God and am thus flawed just like any griffon, and have made many mistakes in my life. Now it is time for this to change! It is time for you to control your own fate. I hereby announce that the state of emergency has been lifted and a new liberal constitution has been ratified. Brodfeld will from now on be a constitutional monarchy, like that of distant Feathisia. I will not abdicate, but my responsibilities and powers have been greatly reduced. The senate will be expanded and its members will not be appointed by me, but elected by you. My dear griffons, after everything that has happened, you deserve to be free!"\n\nThe crowd stared at the King in silent shock for a moment, before some griffons cheered in jubilation and praised the King. The joy soon spread and everyone chanted "Long live the King! Eviliana bless you!"\n\nKloseu smiled and turned to his son, who was watching the celebrating crowd with teary eyes.\n\n"Thank you, son," Kloseu said and embraced him tightly."
brodfeld_rework.11.a:0 "Prywhen is truly free at last!"

brodfeld_rework.13.t:0 "Election Day"
brodfeld_rework.13.d:0 "For the first time in the long history of Prywhen, an election was held for who would govern the griffons, instead of the matter being decided with violence. Among the candidates were not only nobles, but many commoners of all walks of life as well, both male and female. Voter turnout was at 60% as many griffons were still hesitant about the drastic and sudden change. The most important position being filled was that of the Prime Minister, who would lead the government and have more power than the King himself.\n\nOn the day when the results of the vote were to be revealed, Prince Tomado paid a visit to his friend Enrico Chivaldori who lived in Sydia. Encouraged by Tomado and supported by his party PNL (or what remained of it after the eviction), he had reluctantly stood for nomination for the position of Prime Minister.\n\nTomado knocked on the door of his apartment, which opened after a moment. Enrico smiled when he saw Tomado and the two embraced each other. The Prince ordered his bodyguards to stay outside and went in with his friend. The two sat down together after Enrico prepared some tea.\n\n"So, what brings you to my humble abode, friend?" Enrico asked.\n"The election, of course. The results will be revealed today, and I know you're nervous about it. I came here to calm your nerves and celebrate with you when you win." He grinned, winked and sipped the tea.\nEnrico sighed. "Come on, Tom, I'm not going to win. I'm a son of a migrant from Wingbardy and a former music teacher, and I almost got kicked out of the country."\n"None of those are bad things. Prywhenians trust foreigners more than each other, having a humble civilian background makes you more relatable and my pardon has given you special attention and empathy. Not to mention the only other serious candidates are Beam Bruno and Miguel Cordona, neither of which are as popular as you."\nEnrico shook his head and drank some tea. "Maybe, I don't know. Even if I win, I'm not sure I have what it takes to run a country, especially one that has been torn by civil war."\n"Rico, don't sell yourself short. You have many great ideas and a gentle heart. You'll be a great Prime Minister." Tomado took Enrico's violin from a cabinet and gave it to him. "Play some music. I know it always calms you down."\nEnrico smiled in response, took it and began to play."

He entered and slammed the door shut behind him.\n\nEnrico sighed and sat down on his chair, then quietly pondered for a while.

Many griffons were eager to hear what plans for the rebuilding effort he had, for very little had been done so far besides military reforms.\n\nKing Kloseu finally appeared on the balcony, flanked by military officers such as Ion Soimescu and Lexandru Leuescu. He seemed more confident and secure than during the war, and his paranoia of communist assasins appeared to have dissipated completely. He had also gained weight, but his furious, determined gaze prevented anyone from mocking him.\n"Griffons of Prywhen! For a while now have we enjoyed re-established peace, but we cannot simply rest on our laurels much longer. The threat of war looms even now over us, dark and foreboding, but this threat does not only come from within, but from without. Communism is not a plague that was born in Prywhenian soil, but abroad, and beyond our borders the sore of Griffonkind festers still."\n\nThe crowd still expected him to say what he would do to about the wide-spread damage and societal rifts caused by the civil war.\n\n"This is why we cannot simply sit and do nothing, my dear subjects! The red beast is a hydra with many heads, and if one is severed another takes its place. And not only do the reds threaten us, but war-mongers and self-proclaimed liberators as well. The entire world stands against us, seeking to destroy our nation. Conflict is therefore inevitable, war is inevitable, suffering is inevitable. We must prepare or else we will die, for only the strong can resist the coming tide. But worry not, for our nation is strong and can withstand any storm. And every storm has to end and be followed by a peaceful, golden day. The hope of victory in our hearts must never die! Brodfeld shall prevail!"\n\nFor a brief moment the crowd was silent and in deep shock, but then members of Golden Guard among the crowd began furiously clapping and cheering, and other griffons soon joined until most of them were praising the King loudly. Ion Soimescu squinted and spotted those who did not share their patriotic enthusiasm and whispered to Lexandru to get his soldiers ready. Traitors to the King would need to be interrogated at once."

Kloseu's heart had become dark and bitter, unable to truly trust anyone. All the troubles during his reign were not his fault, he thought, but the fault of others. Nobles had taken advantage of his open trade policies, the peasants he had personally liberated only suffered more and the order he had restored after the famine required him to hoard power, which made democrats and communists bitter. So bitter that they callously murdered his beloved wife, his beautiful Queen.\n\nThe only ones to receive even a sliver of his trust were his soldiers, who saw him as the figurehead of the fatherland who had received the blessing of goddess Eviliana herself. But to him, they were nothing but pawns. At this point, almost everyone was.\n\nSo when yet another setback occured during his troubled reign, his reaction was calm. As rioters filled the streets, lead by the disgruntled nobility and his own son, Prince Tomado, he prepared an emergency meeting with his generals. There was no fear or doubt in his eyes. No, he seemed pleased with the recent events, as if he could take advantage of them.\n\nIon Soimescu, his most trusted general, spoke first. "My dear Conducator, Leader, what should we do? Thousands of protesters have occupied or burned down factories and government buildings across the nation. They demand reforms and liberalism, clerly poisoned by traitorous, revolutionary thought. Should I order the army to eradicate them?"\nGeneral Lexandru Leuescu shook his head. "No, you fool, that would lead to another civil war, surely! We must be careful, as if we were handling a bomb. They need to be dealt with but with a more lenient claw."\n\nKloseu looked at each griffon in turn, completely silent and clasping his claws. Then, he finally revealed his plans..."

He would get his sweet revenge and make every single foe suffer.\n\nBesides vengeance and justice, the King desired to benefit from the destruction of his foes.

Prelate Denali promised to forgive them for their sins and gave them Arcturius' blessing.\n\nThe infiltrators wore civilian clothing and joined the large protesting crowd in the center of Kivessin. Prince Tomado was standing on a box and holding a passionate speech to them, saying the King had gone mad with power and should abdicate. Protestors shouted "Bread and peace!" along with democratic slogans. The assassins hid their disgust well and made their way through the masses. The Prince had no bodyguards and was surrounded by his most ardent supporters. One of the infiltrators, a female griffon, shouted how much she loved and admired the Prince, and how he should become their benevolent King. As everyone was distracted by her, another assassin crept behind the Prince and kicked the box from under his paws. He fell on the ground and the crowd gasped in shock. The assassin then kneeled besides him, worry in his face, asking if he was okay. Tomado said his back hurt but he was otherwise fine. Tears in his eyes, the assassin embraced the Prince, begging for his forgiveness. Tomado took his final breath as a dagger entered his heart. The assassin pretended to be shocked and said the Prince's head had hit the paving and that he needed immediate medical assistance. Dozens of griffons wailed in terror and came to aid him and carry him to the hospital. Little did they know it was too late.\n\nAs the assassination took place, King Kloseu visited his wife's tomb in the Temple of Eviliana. He wept, saying their son had betrayed them, apologized for being a bad father who had let their child fall so low, and kissed the tombstone.\n\nSeveral days later news spread that the Prince had died.

But he cared little for security, having no bodyguards. The task was therefore easy to fulfill. The squad knew Tomado was going to hold a speech to the crowds in Sydia, and afterwards leave for a meeting in Larios.

The door opened and a soldier pushed Tomado inside. He showed no signs of resistance and was completely unharmed.

In fact, part of me does not want to call you 'son' anymore."\nTomado hesitantly lifted his gaze to meet his. "I-I am sorry father, but I had no choice. You refused to listen to me before.

Kloseu shouted, standing up from his chair.\n"No. I admit that some protesters... got out of claw. It's hard to control them all."\n"It is not hard. You are just too weak to rule them like a King. Son, being a ruler is about having unquestionable authority. I realized this long ago and have done everything I can so my subjects don't fight back against me, and now I am on the brink of finally succeeding."\n"Maybe because your subjects don't want you to succeed? Maybe they want to rule themselves and decide their own future?"\n"Tomado, while thousands rallied behind you, millions more remained in their homes. They're tired of conflict and chaos. Only an iron claw can ensure it in these dark times. But authority does not mean cruelty. I do not wish to be a tyrant. I only want to ensure my subjects are safe and happy, and am willing to die for that cause."\n"Really?"\n"Yes, son. I do not pursue power for its own sake. Everything I've tried to do, the deeds that make you think I am a monster, were intended to further this goal. I cannot claim to be perfect, but I sure as Tartarus can claim to be determined."\nTomado sighed deeply. "Father, I... I am sorry. I did not understand.""

Large crowds were scattered with gas weapons, leaders such as Enrico Chivaldori were assassinated and heavily armed patrols maintained order in the streets. Pikes of iron were set up alongside the Kivessin-Sydia road and hundreds of prisoners were impaled on them. Thousands of others were sent to labour in the mines of Temsoar.

The last act alone made Kloseu seethe with pure wrath.\n\nAt first he wanted to be just and give every red prisoner a fair trial, but he had realized how long this would take and how expensive it would be. So instead, he decided to implement the final solution to the red menace.\n\nKloseu sent the military to empty the prison camps and escort the red rats to heavily protected labour camps in Temsoar which had recently been prepared for them. There, justice would prevail and the bandit filth would be put to work, helping to rebuild the country they had destroyed by working in the mines. Of course, it was supposed to be a punishment, so the prisoners would receive no luxuries. Failure to meet work quotas would be punished most severely."

The King had become obese over time and the balcony creaked under his weight, but everyone knew it would be a bad idea to pay any attention to it, lest they awaken his wrath.\n\nKloseu cleared his throat and spoke, fury in his voice: "My dear subjects! The day we have been waiting for has finally arrived. Today begins our quest to save the world from the plague known as communism. Our nation suffered greatly from this disease, but now it has been cured. It is our duty therefore to aid others and save them as well. Indeed I will not rest until the cancer of communism has been excised from this world! If we simply sit here, letting other nations fall into red claws, we will regret our lethargy when the communist horde crosses the border to "liberate" us by taking everything we own and installing a puppet to rule over us. Therefore we must march, march onwards to glorious victory over the most wicked foe in the history of Griffonia! Those who die will become martyrs, heroes who will receive remission from their sins. The Gods themselves are on our side against the evil, godless enemy! And with Gods on our side, who can possibly hope to stand against us? To war, my dear subjects!

brodfeld.4.d:0 "One of our few advantages over the communists in the war is our control of the two major cities in Prywhen, Sydia and Kivessin.

We know that tribes of savages inhabit the magical, beast-infested marshes, and while they are backwards, they could still help us with the war.\n\nTherefore we sent a squad to sail along the Evi river and try to contact these tribes, and it seems they were successful. Tribal warbands have emerged from the marshes, armed with muskets our soldiers had brought them, ready to kill everything in sight. This will certainly be a surprise for the red filth!"

Infiltrators have been sent to arm and organize local peasants, who are furious about the communists' confiscation of their private farms. Together, they will begin a campaign of sabotage and terror, burning down the new property of GLA and forcing them to divert troops away from the frontline. This might be just what we need to turn the tide of the war!"

Any engineers of ours who fled the country will certainly not return until the war is over, so perhaps we should attempt to replace them with foreign ones. Out of all the nearby nations, only the Kingdom of Griffonstone and the Free Towns of Gryphus are civilized enough to have spare engineers, so we should send messages to them."

Luckily, one of the federal officials spilled the beans to our prince's mother-in-law, who is a daughter of burgmeister of Fezera and was visiting Skyfall. We should embark a party for the journey and sail west to acquire one of the few models. This might as well be the key to our victory in the civil war. The speed of the operation and reliance of the pirate ship crew that we managed to hire, as they were the only ones willing to do the mission, will depend on the amount of pay."

He speaks softly:\n\n"Hello there, my dearest friend,\nYou need not my rod to lend.\nIt is dark, all is but gray.\nThe time is for sleep, not play.\n\nBut stars hide from the sleeper,\nAs does the stars' grim reaper.\nBut when they brilliantly die,\nSomething new forms in the sky.\n\nYes nothing lives forever\nSome die again however.\nReborn again and again,\nChanged, yet quite same in a chain.\n\nHard... soft... floating... shiny... aflame,\nUntil the last one became\nCold metal, end of the game.\nNow, before the light will fade,\n\nSay the last death of the tale.""

brodfeld_rework.156.d:0 "Two more months pass with nothing of note happening. However, the 75th day after the message's arrival finally comes, and in preparation you lock your door and put all your bodyguards on duty for the night. Then you go to sleep, hoping that nothing crazy will take place.\n\nWhen you wake up, you struggle to open your eyes. When you do, you see nothing but blackness. Soon you realize you've been blindfolded, and also feel rope strung around your neck. Is it a noose?\n\nSomeone pulls you up and then pushes you forward. You hear three knocks, and then speech. You can barely make out the words, except for "By the help of Gods, being free and of good report." Then, a door opens and you are pushed forward again. Cold and sharp steel touches your feathery chest, sending shivers down your spine. Whoever is holding the dagger and threatening your life asks: "Do you feel anything?" Stuttering and confused, you respond "Y-yes".\nThe dagger is pulled away and you are pushed to go forward, presumably through the door that was opened. Inside, you are forced to kneel for the first time since Prelate Denali crowned you all those years ago. A number of persons around you begin to speak at once, praying to gods to grant "His majesty" to Masonry so you "may better be enabled to unfold the beauties of true godliness." You are then told to place your right claw on the Holy Book in front of you as someone places an object in your left claw that feels like a compass. "The tome faces East; The compass must face West." You hesitantly obey and stretch your left arm behind you. Finally, you are asked a question.\n\n"What is the predominant wish of your heart?""

brodfeld_rework.157.t:0 "Secrets, Past Parables"
brodfeld_rework.157.d:0 "Having given your answer, you hear three pounds of a gavel, each followed by everyone in the room clapping once. After the third one your blindfold and noose are removed. You look around yourself. The room is dimly lit with three candles around you and the griffons surrounding you wear hoods. There are three altars, one with the flag of Brodfeld, another with pillars of copper and the third in front of you with the Holy Book.\n\nThe griffon facing you then speaks. "By the grace of the Gods, you are now one of us. The three lights shall now be revealed to you: The Volume of Sacred Law to govern faith, the Square to regulate our actions and the Compass to keep us in bounds with all Griffonkind, especially with fellow Masons. The three lesser lights are Sun, who rules the Day, Moon, who rules the Night, and the Master Mason who rules us. I will also reveal to you that tonight you have already survived two of the three Dangers. If you had not been patient, you would've eagerly rushed into Masonry and been slain by the Dagger. If you had not desired Masonry, you would've tried to run away only to be hanged by the Noose around your neck. The last Danger you must discover yourself in the Parable of Hawkam Abiff, which i will now recite for you."\n"Long ago, King Solomane of Re'em decided to erect a Grand Temple to his Gods. He invited Hawkam Abiff, a famed griffon architect, to be the master of works at the construction. As the temple is nearing completion, three fellowcraft masons from the workforce ambush him, demanding the secrets of a Master Mason. He is challenged by each in turn, and at each refusal to divulge the information he is struck with a mason's tool. The third blow is fatal. His body is hidden by the murderers."\n"Solomane sends out a group of fellowcraft masons to search for Hawkam and they manage to find the body. The three criminals are brought to justice and Solomane informs his workforce that the secret word of a Master Mason is now lost forever."\n"What is the last Danger, Mason of Kissau?""

#quest 9 - final
brodfeld_rework.158.t:0 "Secrets, Floodgates Open"
brodfeld_rework.158.d:0 ""Correct, Apprentice. As a Mason it is important you remain faithful to your brothers and do not share our secrets, even if it puts you in danger. Dead griffons tell no tales, and therefore death is preferable to blatant openness. This is the risk we all take."\n\nYou were then revealed the Sign, the Grip and Word for the First Degree of Masonry. The sign is holding your right claw on your chest with the flat palm down, the grip is done by applying pressure with a talon on top of the first knuckle, and the word is BOAZ. You were given a Mason's badge and a brick, which you then placed in the northeast corner of the room. Because your heart must contain Charity, you were also told to later melt the gold in your regalia, mint coins out of it and give it to the poor. Finally, you were presented the tools of Masons: a gauge to measure work and a gavel to knock off imperfections. Then you were lead out of the room, down the concrete hallway and outside.\n\nThere you realized you had been inside the dam in White Flower, and that the passage you came out of was secret. You were told to make the Sign for the Sun as it rose above the horizon and swear an oath to follow the rules of the Masons, live like a good and loyal citizen of the world and never reveal any secrets."

BRF_assume_direct_control_desc:0 "It is clear now we must step forth and intervene to save Prywhen from itself. Far too long have its griffons suffered and been threatened by tyranny. With the Grace of the Gods, we will guide the nation to enlightenment and salvation. Like They made us in Their image, may we now make Prywhen in our image."
BRF_meet_prelate:0 "Meet With The Prelate"
BRF_meet_prelate_desc:0 "The beloved Prelate unfortunately does not trust us. To him, we are occult and evil, and worship The Fourth God in secret. He is blind to the goodness of our ideals. Now he has become our loudest and most fervent opponent, urging the griffons of Prywhen to overthrow us. Nothing but a thorn on our side, he is. Our previous attempts to reason with him have failed, but perhaps one final meeting can be arranged."
BRF_knightly_friends:0 "Knightly Friends"

BRF_ensure_control:0 "A Virtuous Government"
BRF_ensure_control_desc:0 "Liberty, democracy and prosperity must be ensured for all citizens equally. A government that fails to accomplish this is an unjust and unfaithful government.

Only then can we cooperate with the plans of the Great Architects and raise the Temple of Light."
BRF_religion_state:0 "State Of Religion"
BRF_religion_state_desc:0 "Our nation should be a religious one. Citizenship will be removed from those who do not confess to believe in a greater being. Discussing and arguing about matters of faith will be forbidden, for we do not desire chaos in our blessed and peaceful state. Religious freedom will also be proclaimed, so any faith may be practiced and religious minorities are protected from persecution."
BRF_prevent_conflict:0 "Prevent Political Conflict"
BRF_prevent_conflict_desc:0 "To ensure peace and stability, we must ban all political discourse. Such a thing can only cause discord which we do not desire. While discussion is forbidden, every citizen is allowed to hold an opinion freely. This way they can be satisfied even if they don't get to start a fistfight because of opposing values."
BRF_our_banks:0 "Our Banks"
BRF_our_banks_desc:0 "For centuries Masons have been in control of all banking institutions in the Evi valley. Now it is time to use this control to our advantage and invest our funds in the devastated and backwards economy of Prywhen."
BRF_national_census:0 "First National Census"
BRF_national_census_desc:0 "Knowledge is power, so how can we rule over the populace if we do not even know basic things about them? A census must be held where we record everything possible about the citizenry. This way we can also find fitting conscripts for our army."
BRF_secure_borders:0 "Secure Our Borders"
BRF_secure_borders_desc:0 "Beyond the borders of our fair nation lie many evils and dangers, all wishing to unravel us and our secrets. The borders will be closed and fortifications built in preparation for a possible attack from a treacherous foe who wishes to undo our Godly Kingdom."

BRF_status_griffoness_desc:0 "Citizenship is a privilege that everyone is not worthy of. To become a citizen and be a member of our Godly Kingdom, one must pass the same trials and tests as the initiates of our lodges. Only then can they prove that they deserve salvation and enlightenment."

BRF_protect_peasantry:0 "Protect The Peasantry"
BRF_protect_peasantry_desc:0 "While serfdom was banned by King Kloseu, the status of peasants only worsened as they were not protected by law like serfs, allowing nobles to abuse them as they wished. Now new laws will be enacted to defend the souls of common griffon from exploitation and an eye will be kept on those nobles who are not Masons. Fair wages, fair labour and fair lives for all citizens!"

brodfeld_rework.159.t:0 "The Meeting"
brodfeld_rework.159.d:0 "Shortly after the Masons assumed public control of Prywhen, Prelate Denali's friendly and calm demenour changed completely. He began ceaselessly ranting about the dangers and sins of Masons whom he called "Maarite worshippers and necromancers". He had never liked the King's appointment of Masons to positions in the government and the military but back then he had not been so vocal and aggressive. It is clear he was now genuinely concerned about what the Masons would do with his homeland. Many griffons rallied behind him, especially when he threatened to expose the secrets of Masons by publishing their rituals and symbols for all to see.\n\nHowever, shortly afterwards he vanished.\n\nRumours began to spread almost immediately, with some claiming that the Prelate had been kidnapped and murdered by the Masons. Anti-Masonic protests were held in Sydia and Kivessin and soon even a political party was formed, although it was a single-issue one. But opposition against the Masons petered out when they announced their plans for the future, which included liberty, democracy and prosperity for all griffons. Later a new pro-Mason Prelate was appointed and most griffons forgot about Denali's curious fate. The Anti-Masonic party fell apart when they elected a Mason as their leader."
brodfeld_rework.159.a:0 "A thorn removed."
brodfeld_rework.159.b:0 "Prelate Denali will no longer be available as an advisor.\n"

brodfeld_rework.160.t:0 "Citizenship Reform"
brodfeld_rework.160.d:0 "Today a controversial law was passed by the Masons: All griffons were suddenly stripped of their citizenship status and could only regain it by joining a Masonic lodge. This meant they lost countless privileges and protections and became little more than vagrants with extremely limited rights. Services that the Masons had made free for citizens were now unavailable to them, including education and healthcare.\n\nThis, of course, caused massive outrage and the griffons began preparing a huge riot in Kivessin. However the leading figures responsible for organizing it vanished one by one without a trace, and law enforcement cared too little to investigate. Led by the newly appointed Prelate, religious griffons held a counter-protest which amassed a large amount of devout followers. Soon enough voices of dissent had silenced completely and griffons either flocked to join the ranks of the Masons or accepted their grim, poor fates."
brodfeld_rework.160.a:0 "It is the will of the Gods."

brodfeld_rework.161.t:0 "An Invitation From Prywhen"
brodfeld_rework.161.d:0 "An envoy from Prywhen arrived in our capital today and met with our leaders. He presented us an invitation into the League of Nations, a loose cooperative organization with many agencies specializing in aiding the economy and improving the lives of common citizenry. It could be very beneficial for us to say yes to this offer, though it means we must also sign a pact of non-aggression with Prywhen."
brodfeld_rework.161.a:0 "We accept the generous offer."
brodfeld_rework.161.b:0 "You will receive national spirits benefitting your nation, depending on which ones Prywhen has unlocked.\n"

brodfeld_rework.162.t:0 "[From.GetName] Has Joined The League"
brodfeld_rework.162.d:0 "Good news from [From.Capital.GetName]! [From.GetNameDef] has accepted our offer and has signed several treaties which make them a member of the League of Nations. Our agencies and organizations can now begin operating within their borders and improving the lives of all."
brodfeld_rework.162.a:0 "We are fulfilling the Gods' Deep Plan."
brodfeld_rework.162.b:0 "New decisions unlocked.\n"

brodfeld_rework.163.t:0 "[From.GetName] Refused To Join"
brodfeld_rework.163.d:0 "Bad news from [From.Capital.GetName]! [From.GetNameDef] has refused our offer, claiming they have no need to grow the size of their bureaucratic apparatus. This nonsense can be translated to "We have other plans for you." It might be wise to prepare our defences. We can of course continue the negotiations and attempt to invite them again later, as long as they don't attack us first."
brodfeld_rework.163.a:0 "We will not give up yet."

brodfeld_rework.164.t:0 "Join With Our Brothers"
brodfeld_rework.164.d:0 "Prominent political figures within our nation have met with [Root.GetLeader], requesting that we let Prywhen annex us. They say our relationship has only brought us good things, including wealth and scientific advancement, and that even closer cooperation can greatly increase these benefits. Mason of [Root.Capital.GetName] says that Prywhen will bring liberty, democracy and prosperity to all of us."
brodfeld_rework.164.a:0 "A wonderful idea, fellow Masons!"
brodfeld_rework.164.b:0 "You will be annexed.\n"

brodfeld_rework.165.t:0 "Attack On Our Freedom"
brodfeld_rework.165.d:0 "Horrible news from Sydia arrived in the capital today. A terrorist attack had been made in the central market square in the middle of the day at the busiest hour when griffons were buying fish from fishergriffs. A lone wolf wore a vest filled with explosives and then committed suicide with them, killing dozens of bystanders and causing massive chaos which resulted in additional deaths. Somehow the Masons confirmed the identity and nationality of the attacker mere hours later and confirmed it had been a foreigner sent by their government to turn the citizens of Prywhen against each other and trigger another civil war. The King himself declared this would not stand and gave permission to the Masons to begin a military offensive to punish those responsible.\n\nThose who claimed the attack was an inside job soon disappeared mysteriously."
brodfeld_rework.165.a:0 "Lushian savages were responsible for the attack!"
brodfeld_rework.165.c:0 "Gryphian barbarians were responsible for the attack!"
brodfeld_rework.165.f:0 "Gryphus' privateers were responsible for the attack!"

The Strength, Wisdom and Beauty of the divine creative power -- through one of its mediums of expressions -- shall soon stand revealed.\n\nThe Ancient Mysteries will be restored, the ancient landmarks will again be recognised, those landmarks which Masonry has so earnestly preserved and which have been hitherto securely embalmed in the Masonic rituals, awaiting the day of restoration and of resurrection. With the uniting of the world and the unfolding, developing, maturation and expansion of consciousness, ever upwards and onwards towards a greater Light, we shall reach true Enlightenment, fulfill the Plan of the Gods and build the Temple of Light below the heavens, in the image of the Temple Above."
brodfeld_rework.167.a:0 "The final steps are being taken."

brodfeld_rework.168.t:0 "A Conspiracy Discovered!"
brodfeld_rework.168.d:0 "Our secret service has unveiled a plot to eradicate our independence and sovereignty. Multiple members of our government have been exposed to belong to Masonic Lodges, strange cults all obeying the orders of the Grand Orient in Prywhen, which desires to integrate us. It seems joining the League of Nations and allowing the Prywhenians to expand their outwardly benevolent organizations into our country was a mistake as the foreigners soon began indoctrinating our officials in secret.\n\nWe must arrest any Masons within our borders, leave the League of Nations immediately and break all diplomatic ties with Prywhen, then prepare for war. The Masons have gone too far in their madness."
brodfeld_rework.168.a:0 "We must depose those cultists!"

brodfeld_rework.169.t:0 "Our Plans Foiled"
brodfeld_rework.169.d:0 "It seems our sacred secrets were not secret enough. The foreigners were too clever and discovered our Plan, much to our dismay. Any Masons in their nation have been arrested and [From.GetNameDef] has officially left the League of Nations. Worst of all, they now seek to invade our fair nation and depose us. They stand against the Will of the Great Architects themselves, and will face their divine wrath."
brodfeld_rework.169.a:0 "Prepare for war. The Gods are with us."

brodfeld_rework.172.t:0 "The Absent King"
brodfeld_rework.172.d:0 "It has been two weeks now since the King vanished without a trace.\n\nMilitiagriffs have searched everywhere they could, servants have been extensively interrogated and private detectives had been hired to investigate the matter. Yet no one could find any clues about the King's whereabouts. Based on all evidence, he entered his bedroom, disappeared into thin air and never left it.\n\nTo avoid complete chaos in the country, His Majesty's son, Prince Tomado, has taken the reins of the government. Already he has promised democratic reforms and elections, much to the dismay of the Golden Guard who have now lost their most generous supporter. However, the Prince promises to step down as soon as his father is found, which should happen very soon, and refuses to assume the title of King."

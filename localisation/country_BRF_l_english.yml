#CHARACTER DESCRIPTIONS & ADVISORS
BRF_Kloseu_desc:0 "King Kloseu de Kissau is the first ruler of the Kingdom of Brodfeld. He became the Prince of Brodfeld in 963 ALB and was elected Domnitor (ruling prince) of Kivessin and Sydia in 965 ALB. In 973 ALB, when the Griffonian Empire was falling apart, Kloseu declared independence and claimed the title of King of Brodfeld. He was crowned in the Grand Temple of Eviliana in Kivessin by Prelate Denali.\n\nDuring his rule Brodfeld grew wealthier and became known as the ricebasket of Griffonia, yet blight caused the Great Famine in 995 ALB. After the economic crisis of the new millenium, Kloseu declared a state of emergency in 1001 ALB which granted him autocratic powers and cracked down on any disorder and dissent, restoring stability in Brodfeld.\n\nThe peace was brief, however, as in 1003 ALB an assassination attempt was made on him while he was spectating a military parade in Kivessin with his wife. He was merely wounded on his cheek, but his wife died in his embrace. Afterwards he blamed communists and banned all communist organizations, yet members of PCP resisted arrest, formed the GLA and rebelled. The civil war began."
BRF_Kloseu_fasc_desc:0 "King Kloseu de Kissau has become Autocrat of All Prywhen, the undisputed ruler of Brodfeld with nigh-unlimited powers. The military and the members of the fanatical Golden Guard are unquestionably loyal to him, while those who oppose him know their doom is near. The griffons of Prywhen simply call him 'Conducator', Leader, the chosen one of goddess Eviliana and their mighty master."
BRF_our_king:0 "King Kloseu de Kissau"
BRF_our_king_desc:0 "In a miraculous turn of events, the King has listened to reason and has written a new constitution, relinquishing most of his powers to a democratically elected Senate and turning into little more than a figurehead of the nation. He now spends most of his time in his secluded manor on the Evi river and goes fishing every day."
BRF_Enrico:0 "Enrico Chivaldori"
BRF_Enrico_leader_desc:0 "Enrico Chivaldori is a son of a Wingbardian migrant and has lived in Sydia his whole life. He has had a passion for music his entire life and is a talented violin player. Over his life he has worked as a music teacher and a conductor before finally entering politics and joining PNL. He is a supporter of democracy and harmony and a close friend of Prince Tomado who shares his liberal ideals. He was among the thousands of griffons who Kloseu banished from the country for being supporters of dangerous ideas but the Prince convinced his father to pardon him. A calm, reasonable speaker, he managed to get elected Prime Minister (possibly with some help from his royal friend) and now leads the government of Brodfeld."
BRF_Prelate:0 "Prelate Denali"
BRF_Prelate_desc:0 "Prelate Denali is an ancient griffon, rivaling Archon Eros in age. He has seen Prywhen be united and go through hard times of great suffering. Always has he been aiding those in need, the poor and downtrodden of society who find salvation in religion. To him, communists are monsters who wish to destroy the world as we know it and doom the souls of griffons by abandoning their Gods."

BRF_Mason_Of_Kivessin:0 "Mason of Kivessin"
BRF_Tomado:0 "Prince Tomado de Kissau"
BRF_Tomado_desc:0 "Tomado de Kissau is King Kloseu's only son and legitimate heir. He is an idealistic griffon in his early twenties who lost his mother when an assassination attempt was made on his father. He has been influenced by liberal ideals, mostly thanks to his close friend Enrico Chivaldori, and wishes for Brodfeld to become a constitutional monarchy. His father's recent cruelty and despotism made him worried and afraid."
BRF_princess_mira:0 "Princess Mira de Kissau"

BRF_Constan_Pryzan:0 "Constanti Privezan"
BRF_Walrus_desc:0 "§gBorn in 966 ALB, Sycle was once one of the many peasants on the countryside, living in one of the many unknown villages. Having lived on the border near the Gryphian Host, he had faced one of the raids done by the Cossacks as a child. Having witnessed their immense speed at which they flew, agility of their moves and determination on their faces, this shaped the childhood of Sycle's life. He eagerly studied many wars of the past, and enlisted at the local garrison as soon as he became 18. Year after year of eager and loyal service saw him soon promoted to an officer, and later, a general. To him, the fact that a lowly peasant could rise to the rank of a General, proved him that the current system was indeed, fair and just, for all those willing to work for their future. After the attempted assassination of the King in 1003 ALB, he was one of the many officers involved in the arrests and executions of various socialist groups. Deeply loyal, he will follow the King to the Gates of Tartarus itself.§!"

### NEW MIL STUFF ###

### ARMY ### 
BRF_army_new_stuff:0 "Reorganize The Army"
BRF_army_new_stuff_desc:0 "The Royal Army that had stagnated for centuries was forced to adapt rapidly as the civil war erupted. Now there is peace, but we must continue to reform our battered forces into a proper modern military, strong enough to oppose any domestic or foreign threats."
BRF_experimental_weapons:0 "Experiment With Magical Weapons"
BRF_experimental_weapons_desc:0 "Sicameon, one of our old trade partners, has long pioneered the use of crystals in technology. One innovation which we should consider adopting is magical weaponry, powered by crystals. Such guns are dangerous and would require us to import crystals from abroad, but they're potent enough to blow up a communist in a single shot."
BRF_knight_weapons:0 "Knights Of The Modern Age"
BRF_knight_weapons_desc:0 "As weapons keep increasing in accuracy and lethality, knights need better equipment if they are to be relevant. They need new varities of armour and heavier weapons to increase their survivability and hitting power. This way we will ensure they remain an elite force, capable of crushing our foes on the battlefield."
BRF_project_radar:0 "Zgarie Nori" 
BRF_project_radar_desc:0 "More advanced countries have been experimenting with a new technology that allows easy detection of large objects such as ships and airplanes from a long distance. The foreigners call it RADAR, but our own scientists are now developing their own version called Zgârie Nor, the Sky-Scraper. With this device, no enemy bombers or invasion ships will be able to surprise us."
BRF_encrypt_decrypt:0 "Project Descifra"
BRF_encrypt_decrypt_desc:0 "For as long as there have been military communications, there has been secrecy and attempts to breach it. Both communications as well as cryptological machines have become more and more advanced in an arms race of sorts. The Masons are now offering to help us in developing brand new methods of encryption and decryption so we can keep up in this arms race and safeguard our secrets."
BRF_a_draft:0 "Expand The Draft"
BRF_a_draft_desc:0 "The long civil war drained our griffonpower, and we have many gaps to fill among the ranks of the military. Not only does our army need to be rebuilt, but expanded as well so it can face the ever larger armies of our enemies. For this, we need to further increase conscription rates. Some griffons may grumble, but they should remember that every citizen must fulfill their patriotic duty."
BRF_new_training:0 "Adopt New Training Methods"
BRF_new_training_desc:0 "The civil war taught us a painful lesson: Our soldiers were not prepared to fight well against the communist rebels. This is due to outdated training methods which do not take into account the changed nature of warfare. This must be addressed, so our army knows how to use the latest tactics and weapons effectively against any kind of foe, communist or not."
BRF_officer_academy:0 "Regal Academia de Ofiteri"
BRF_officer_academy_desc:0 "Our officers have served us well, there is no denying that. But the training they received was outdated, so it is about time they receive additional training to hone their skills even further. This way they too will be prepared to fight a modern war with modern strategies. We shall open a new military academy in Kivessin and hire advisors from abroad to retrain our generals."
BRF_army_offensive:0 "An Offensive Approach"
BRF_army_offensive_desc:0 "The communist scum were not beaten with idle twiddling of thumbs, but with decisive action and savage blows! Such tactics gave us victory in the civil war, and they will give us victory in any future war we must fight. Brodfeld is a kingdom of brave warriors, who are not afraid of bold offensives through the enemy lines."
BRF_army_defensive:0 "A Defensive Approach"
BRF_army_defensive_desc:0 "Foolhardy and overly confident offensives in the beginning of the civil war almost caused our defeat as communists ambushed and destroyed many of our divisions. We have learned from our mistakes, however, and will not fall into such traps in the future. Patience and careful planning are keys to victory, allowing us to preserve our depleted griffonpower."
BRF_new_guns_def:0 "Long-ranged Infantry Weapons"
BRF_new_guns_def_desc:0 "The best way to hold a defensive position is by blowing up the enemy before they can even reach you. Because of this, we should invest in equipping our soldiers with long-ranged weapons such as mortars and heavy machine guns, which will ease their task of defending our Kingdom from foreign invaders."
BRF_additional_support_weapons:0 "Rifle Modernization"
BRF_additional_support_weapons_desc:0 "Thanks to aid from Wingbardy, we have begun to improve the equipment of our soldiers, brining it up to modern standards. However, more work remains done so every griffon is adequately equipped with helmets, grenades and small arms. When we first faced the communists, we were armed with flintlocks. Next time we will have semi-automatic rifles."
BRF_arty_def:0 "Bigger Guns, Bigger Shells"
BRF_arty_def_desc:0 "Artillery is a vital component of modern armies. With concentrated artillery barrages, even the fierces offensives can be broken with relative ease. Therefore it would be wise to increase the caliber of our big guns, so they can fire larger shells at a greater distance. With proper artillery, any communist insurgency can be destroyed from afar before it can truly become a threat."
BRF_anti_tank_def:0 "Develop Anti-Tank Weaponry"
BRF_anti_tank_def_desc:0 "A new miracle weapon which is commonly known as "tank" is threatening to turn the balance of war in favour of the attacker. If we wish to avoid being encircled by columns of these steel beasts, we must acquire weaponry strong enough to destroy them. Dedicated anti-tank guns firing hard tungsten bullets are such a weapon, able to pierce the metal skin of tanks."
BRF_support_companies_def:0 "Preserving Our Griffons And Guns"
BRF_support_companies_def_desc:0 "If we want to hold out as long as possible against the enemy, we need to ensure our resources last long enough. By forming dedicated support companies tasked with minimizing loss of equipment and lives, we can endure even the most grievous of assaults for as long as the lines hold, without needing to worry about running out of anything."
BRF_defense_doctrine:0 "Defense is the Best Offense"
BRF_defense_doctrine_desc:0 "Some say offense is the best defense, but we say otherwise. The duty of our army is to defend the Kingdom, and defend it we shall, instead of throwing away our griffons in futile attacks. Brodfeld will truly be like gold, a noble metal that can last for millenia without degredation, always shimmering brightly under the sun of Boreas."
BRF_new_guns_off:0 "Panoply Of War"
BRF_new_guns_off_desc:0 "The sidearms our soldiers carry are no less important than their primary weapons. To carry out a successful offensive, they need not only rifles but various explosives, pistols, bayonets, combat knives, binoculars, shovels and so on. We need to make sure every soldier is well-equipped with the best kit, so they can carry out any assault under any conditions."
BRF_tank_stuff:0 "Beasts Of Steel"
BRF_tank_stuff_desc:0 "We previously learned of the existence of a new type of weapon that is revolutionizing warfare, but now we have concrete knowledge of what it is like. With this knowledge, we can tame these beasts of metal and use them on the field of battle against our enemies. A spearhead of tanks can penetrate enemy defenses, allowing our soldiers to flood in and overwhelm our pathetic foes."
BRF_arty_off:0 "Mobile Artillery"
BRF_arty_off_desc:0 "Artillery plays a key role in offensives, weakening the defences of the enemy so infantry can assault them. However, artillery is slow to pull and even with their long range, they cannot keep up with more mobile forces. A solution is to use trucks instead of griffons to haul our guns, allowing rapid redeployment of gun batteries where ever they are needed."
BRF_anti_tank_off:0 "Infantry Motorization"
BRF_anti_tank_off_desc:0 "Trucks are like self-propelled wagons, or trains that don't need to go on rails. On well-maintained roads, their speed surpasses that of a flying griffon, and their carrying capacity is much larger. If we provide trucks for our army, our infantry will be able to rapidly advance, using speed to stay one step ahead of the enemy."
BRF_support_companies_off:0 "Supporting Our Assaults"
BRF_support_companies_off_desc:0 "An unsupported attack is likely to fail, especially if everything doesn't go as planned. We need to form support companies within our army divisions whose tasks will be to provide their fellow soldiers with intelligence, communications and equipment repair. With their help, our griffons will be able to kill twice as many communists as before."
BRF_offense_doctrine:0 "Strike First!"
BRF_offense_doctrine_desc:0 "It is true indeed that offense is the best defense. Instead of waiting for our enemies to seize the initiative, we must be swift and strike at them before they can even begin to prepare their defenses. We will not allow anyone to step on the sacred fertile soil of Prywhen. Blood shall only be spilt on foreign land, taken from the enemy without hesitation."

### AIR ### (Need Loc)
BRF_strat_destruction:0 "Unrestricted Aerial Warfare"
BRF_strat_destruction_desc:0 "The duty of our air force will be to hinder the enemy's war effort by any means necessary. The definition of "civilian target" must be stretched, as our enemies are likely to utilize railways and communications normally reserved for civilian use. Destruction of infrastructure and industrial capacity must be accomplished, no matter how much collateral damage it causes."
BRF_battlefield_support_focus:0 "In Support Of The Army"
BRF_battlefield_support_focus_desc:0 "Our air force exists for a single purpose: To support our army and help them accomplish their goals. Air commanders will serve under army generals and cooperate with them closely, so they can provide effective support where ever it is needed, as quickly as possible. Working in tandem, their strength is more than doubled."
BRF_operational_integrity_focus:0 "A Flexible Air Force"
BRF_operational_integrity_focus_desc:0 "We should not assign any strict role for our air force. Instead, they will do anything that is needed, whenever they are needed. Our pilots will be trained to fulfill a variety of missions depending on the situation. They may not excel at any individual task, but they make up for it by being adaptive and flexible."
BRF_air_stuff:0 "Beakau Flight Academy"
BRF_air_stuff_desc:0 "To create a proper air force, we will need trained pilots. For this purpose we will found the Beakau Flight Academy, staffed by best foreign experts money can buy. They will teach our griffons how to pilot these flying machines of death and destruction, while also helping our engineers in producing the latest airplane designs."
BRF_fighter_projects:0 "Procure Fighters From Wingbardy"
BRF_fighter_projects_desc:0 "We have managed to strike a deal with Accipitri, a Wingbardian aircraft manufacturing company. In exchange for a hefty sum of gold, they will provide us with a hundred fighters, fresh from their factories. This will be a good addition to our air force, and reverse-engineering the models will provide us with many insights."
BRF_doctrinal_development:0 "Doctrinal Development"
BRF_doctrinal_development_desc:0 "With newly trained officers graduating from the Beakau academy, we can further develop our aerial doctrines and strategies. They will find incresingly effective ways to use aerial power to destroy communists from a distance and achieve complete dominance in the sky."
BRF_strat:0 "Heavy Bomber Models"
BRF_strat_desc:0 "Heavier, larger planes may be slower, but they have increased capacity for fuel and, more importantly, bombs. With their great range, they can perform long missions far behind enemy lines and drop a huge payload of explosives at strategic locations. Such planes are expensive to make, but the damage they can cause is worth the price."
BRF_tact:0 "Light Bomber Models"
BRF_tact_desc:0 "Light bombers are still more cumbersome than fighters, but are designed to be far more flexible than their heavier counterparts. They can perform a variety of missions and still cause considerable damage despite carrying less bombs. Most importantly, they are cheaper than strategic bombers."
BRF_CAS_projects:0 "Dive Bomber Development"
BRF_CAS_projects_desc:0 "To provide effective support for our infantry, we need agile and fast planes that can bombard small targets in the midst of battle. Dive bombers are meant to fulfill such a role, being able to achieve great accuracy by rising high and then diving straight down, dropping their payload right on top of an enemy target, wailing sirens causing the enemy morale to waver."
BRF_rocket_projects:0 "The Racheta Projects"
BRF_rocket_projects_desc:0 "Rockets have been used in warfare for centuries, but their range and effectiveness has been limited. With modern fuel, materials and engineering skill, newer rocket designs can have a long range and relatively good accuracy, being able to destroy single targets from far away. Their small size and high speed make them almost impossible to intercept."
BRF_paratrooper_project:0 "The Drop Troops"
BRF_paratrooper_project_desc:0 "Griffons can fly, that is true, but they do not have the strength or stamina to fly as high or fast as airplanes. However, we can make transport planes to carry griffon soldiers, who can then jump off and glide down using their wings. Of course, most griffons have never flown that high, so these "drop troopers" will need special training."
BRF_jet_fighters:0 "Project Carucior de Boi"
BRF_jet_fighters_desc:0 "The griffon who proposed attaching rockets to planes was called mad, but perhaps she had a point. With proper engineering, rocket-planes can fly much faster than regular ones, possibly even breaking the sound barrier. Such velocity will be hazardous, so we must take our time and be careful when we design and build these rocket-planes."
BRF_formalize_airforce_stuff:0 "Formalize the Air Force"
BRF_formalize_airforce_stuff_desc:0 "For centuries we griffons have fought in the air, but even aerial warfare cannot avoid the march of technology. Airplanes are faster, more powerful and more resilient than any griffon. If we want to ensure our control of the skies above, we need to focus on developing our air force."
BRF_small_airfields:0 "Strategic Military Airfields"

BRF_trimmed_wingtops:0 "Wingtip Devices"
BRF_trimmed_wingtops_desc:0 "Wingtip vortices cause drag, which makes planes consume more fuel and be less agile. By experimenting with various wingtip designs we can improve the lift-to-drag ratio of our aircraft."
BRF_give_airshow:0 "An Airshow For The Enemy"
BRF_give_airshow_desc:0 "Our airplanes are agile thanks to their superior design. By training skilled pilots to use them, we will have an airforce whose skill and ability is to be reckoned with!"
BRF_big_airfield:0 "Salt Island Air Base"

BRF_navy_stuff:0 "Restore the Royal Navy"
BRF_navy_stuff_desc:0 "In a controversial move, the Royal Navy had been disbanded by King Kloseu, as it was too expensive to maintain and the Gryphussian trade company handled shipping and escorting of trade convoys. But now he knows well that we cannot rely on others to defend us, so the Royal Navy shall be rebuilt from scratch!"
BRF_base_strike_f:0 "Floating Air Bases"
BRF_base_strike_f_desc:0 "We are founding both an air force and a navy at the same time. Why not take advantage of this? Both should cooperate closely during war, our fleet focusing on carriers and their escorts, functioning as mobile bases for our planes. Brodfeld's reach will extend far indeed, and no communist will be safe from us."
BRF_fleet_being_f:0 "A Mighty Battlefleet"
BRF_fleet_being_f_desc:0 "Our navy will primarily consist of heavy and large ships, capable of both enduring and causing substantial damage. They will have thick hulls and big guns, and a force of smaller ships will escort them to battle, where they will face the enemy fleet head on."
BRF_trade_indirection_f:0 "Hunt And Destroy"
BRF_trade_indirection_f_desc:0 "There is no point in expending a huge amount of time and effort to build a big fleet from scratch. Instead, we should focus on a small but effective fleet, which will not try to achieve naval supremacy but instead hunt down isolated ships and trade convoys, hindering the enemy's war effort."
BRF_carrier_f:0 "Portavion Development"
BRF_carrier_f_desc:0 "Portavions, or carriers as foreigners call them, are large ships with an in-built runway, allowing for planes to take off and land, as well as refuel. Developing larger hulls would allow larger capacity, meaning they could support an even larger amount of planes."
BRF_navy_planes_f:0 "Avioane Navale"
BRF_navy_planes_f_desc:0 "Regular planes do not perform optimally at sea. For this reason we must develop dedicated naval bombers armed with aerial torpedoes. They will be able to effectively attack naval vessels and cause great damage."
BRF_dockyards:0 "Additional Dockyards"
BRF_dockyards_desc:0 "Our current production capacity is still not enough for our naval reconstruction effort. We need to further invest in expanding our dockyards as well as building new ones. Only then can we hope to build a fleet large and strong enough to defend Brodfeld from invaders."
BRF_battlecruiser_f:0 "Crucisator de Linie Development"
BRF_battlecruiser_f_desc:0 "Modern ships-of-the-line still fulfill the same role as before, albeit they are no longer made of wood and equipped with cannons. Instead, they are made of steel and armed with heavy weapons. These battlecruisers are the core of any navy."
BRF_light_cruiser_f:0 "Cruiser Usor Development"
BRF_light_cruiser_f_desc:0 "Light cruisers are similar to battlecruisers as their name would imply, but are smaller, faster and have less firepower. They fulfill the space between proper capital ships and escorts, being able to fulfill both roles adequately, but excelling at neither."
BRF_battleship_f:0 "The Vas de Razboi"
BRF_battleship_f_desc:0 "Modern engineering allows the construction of ever larger vessels. Battleships are the pinnacle of ambition, being massive behemoths of steel, mobile fortresses armed to the brim with deadly weaponry. Truly, the navies of our enemies would tremble before us if we were to make such ships!"
BRF_expand_dockyards:0 "Further Expand the Dockyards"
BRF_expand_dockyards_desc:0 "This is not enough! The King demands we keep expanding our dockyards so we can build a truly mighty fleet, capable of defending Brodfeld from powerful invaders and guarding our vital shipping lanes."
BRF_destroyer_f:0 "New Destroyer Hulls"
BRF_destroyer_f_desc:0 "Destroyers are quite small ships, but nonetheless important as they are the primary line of defence against submarines. They are vital escort ships and for all their firepower and strength, larger ships would not survive without them."
BRF_submarine_f:0 "Sharks Of Steel"
BRF_submarine_f_desc:0 "Submarines are a relatively new invention, and have already proven to be terribly effective. They are difficult to detect and even harder to destroy, being able to hide deep beneath the ocean's surface. They excel at hunting unprotected convoys and as such would allow us to cause great damage to our enemies' supply routes."
BRF_transport_f:0 "Boarding Vessels"
BRF_transport_f_desc:0 "So far our navy has a purely defensive purpose, but what if we want to use it offensively? Ships, of course, cannot go on land, but they can carry soldiers and their equipment. Dedicated transport ships would have large capacity, able to carry entire battalions of soldiers across the waters."
BRF_naval_books:0 "The Bluejacket's Manual"
BRF_naval_books_desc:0 "If we wish to rebuild our navy, we need to train many new personnel. Giving basic clawbooks to all our naval personnel will proliferate knowledge across the navy and ensure everyone knows the basics of modern naval warfare."
BRF_analyze_fleets:0 "Analyze Foreign Fleets"
BRF_analyze_fleets_desc:0 "Navies of other countries are countless nautical miles ahead of us. To truly rebuild our navy, we need to send observers and spies abroad to countries such as Wingbardy and Skyfall. They will report to us about latest naval doctrines and ship designs."
BRF_invest_sydia:0 "Invest In Sydia's Shipyard"
BRF_invest_sydia_desc:0 "Sydia's port is by far the largest one in our country, and so is its famed shipyard. However, it has for years focused on building wooden ships. Investing royal funds into the modernization and expansion of Sydia's dockyard will aid us in our naval reformation effort."
BRF_under_sight:0 "Out Of Sight"
BRF_under_sight_desc:0 "Naval warfare has always been two-dimensional, but technological development has expanded it into a new dimension. Not only is air superiority above the sea important, but so is superiority under the surface. Submarines make it easy to raid the trade routes of the enemy and ensure victory in the next war."
BRF_kings_navy:0 "The King's Navy"
BRF_kings_navy_desc:0 "After much effort our navy has been modernized and is no longer the laughingstock of Southern Griffonia. Truly, our blessed King can be proud of his Golden Navy!"

BRF_reopen_ports_desc:0 "The old capital of the Principality of Sydia has always been the largest and busiest port in Prywhen. The war, however, made foreign traders abandon it and forced us to conscript many of the local fishergriffs. Now that peace and order have been restored, merchants and fishers can get back to business! We will repair the port, lower trade tariffs and ease taxation on fish markets, thus helping our economy recover."
BRF_qwoptia_wood:0 "Lifov Forestry"
BRF_qwoptia_wood_desc:0 "Out of all the myriad materials needed for the reconstruction effort, wood stands above all else. By investing in sawmills and nationalizing the forestry companies of Crowoia and Qwoptia we can begin mass production of cheap yet versatile lumber. And after the reconstruction is over, we will have a strong forest industry ready to make profit!"

While it may be difficult, expensive and time-consuming to build, Mason says he will take care of everything as long as we provide workers."
BRF_rice_fields:0 "Fields Of Gold"
BRF_rice_fields_desc:0 "Decades ago, Brodfeld was the ricebasket of Griffonia. However, this reliance on rice caused the Great Famine of 995 ALB after blight struck (Communist claims that the famine was the fault of the King's policies is pure propaganda). It is time to restore the golden fields of old! We shall redistribute farmland confiscated from the reds and give wheat, barley and oat seeds to the new owners."
BRF_prosperity:0 "Live In Prosperity"
BRF_prosperity_desc:0 "With foreign merchant ships arriving in Sydia, fishers catching fish in the Bay of Salt, our unemployed conscripted to work on the White Flower dam and houses being rebuilt with lumber from Lifov, we are quickly beginning to recover. Much work remains to be done, but the seeds have been planted, and from them golden flowers shall sprout and eventually bloom."
BRF_river_ferry:0 "Evi River Ferry"
BRF_river_ferry_desc:0 "Communist sabotage might've ruined most of our regular roads, but the watery highways of nature are invincible: Rivers!

BRF_new_schools:0 "New Schools Across the Nation"
BRF_new_schools_desc:0 "Prelate Denali and the clergy are grateful to us for saving them from godless communists, who wished to eradicate religion and create a secular state.

We shall establish temple schools, where our ignorant subjects are taught to read, count and respect Gods and Kings!"
BRF_develop_oil:0 "Repair Our Oil Wells"
BRF_develop_oil_desc:0 "The Terrible Marsh is a cursed land, inhabited mostly by tribal griffons and magical monsters. But it is far from worthless, as beneath the marshes lie vast oil deposits.

BRF_sydacute_highway:0 "Royal Sydia-Temsoar Road"
BRF_sydacute_highway_desc:0 "Our progress in repairing damaged roads has gone well. So well, in fact, that we could start building new ones!

BRF_kivsydia_railway_desc:0 "Another infrastructure project we will begin in our blessed King's honour is the Kivessin-Sydia railway, first of its kind in Prywhen. While the Evi river already provides an excellent route of transportation, there is no doubt that modern trains are much faster than ferries and have higher capacity.

BRF_hire_miners:0 "Hire Workers For Temsoar Mines"
BRF_hire_miners_desc:0 "Many miners of Temsoar joined the communists during the civil war and never returned home. As a result, the mines are in sore need of more labourers which we must provide.

BRF_yearly_fair:0 "Yearly Science Fairs"
BRF_yearly_fair_desc:0 "Mason of Twelt has proposed that we establish a yearly science fair. Our students will form teams and work together on a science project which they shall then present at the fair. The most ground-breaking presentation will receive a Royal Award. This will not only allow us to find talented griffons, but will also popularize science and motivate our students." 
BRF_concrete_building:0 "Reinforced Concrete"
BRF_concrete_building_desc:0 "While concrete has been used in Prywhen for centuries, Mason of Sydia says that mass-production of steel allows us to adopt superior reinforced concrete.

BRF_army_unemployed:0 "Conscript The Unemployed"
BRF_army_unemployed_desc:0 "The decade-long economic crisis and the civil war have left hundreds of thousands of griffons unemployed, loitering around in our cities and towns.

BRF_equip_workers:0 "Arm The Workers"
BRF_equip_workers_desc:0 "Desperate times call for desperate measures. While so far workers in factories and workshops have been contributing to our war effort indirectly, we now need their more direct aid from them.

BRF_ease_conscription:0 "Ease Conscription"
BRF_ease_conscription_desc:0 "These hard times of war take a toll on our griffons, especially those who are forced to serve in the Royal Army.

brodfeld_rework.1.d:0 "Our police forces in cities and the local militia in towns have gathered an impressive crowd of unemployed and idle griffons, who have been given a basic training in using guns, fighting in formation and following orders. Most of them grasped the basics, and that is good enough for we have no time or resources for anything more. Now we will send them to the front and hope the communists are terrified by our sudden increase in numbers!"
brodfeld_rework.1.a:0 "Onwards, to a brighter future!"
brodfeld_rework.1.b:0 "Get 2 divisions of Brodfeld's unemployed in our capital, Kivessin"

brodfeld_rework.2.t:0 "Put Away The Worktools!"
brodfeld_rework.2.d:0 "Tens of thousands of our factory workers bid farewell to their loved ones today as they begin their march to the front. They, too, have received only the most basic training in this dire time, but with the blessings of Arcturius and Eviliana they will fight like true soldiers. Each draftee was given a portrait of the King to inspire them and to remind them of where their loyalty lies.\n\nNow their relatives, unfit for combat, have started working in the factories. They lack work experience and often have children to take care of. Nevertheless, it is still better than having the workshops remain silent."
brodfeld_rework.2.a:0 "A tactical necessity."
brodfeld_rework.2.b:0 "Get 2 divisions of Brodfeld's workers in our capital, Kivessin"

brodfeld_rework.3.t:0 "In The Name Of The King, Defend Our Lands!"
brodfeld_rework.3.d:0 "Thousands upon thousands of civilians have been armed, though we have nowhere near enough resources to give them all even basic training. We have no alternative but to simply throw these elders, cripples, mothers and children into battle. It is our last and perhaps only hope to push back the red tide! Yet our griffons are not afraid, for death in battle is preferable to life under communism!\n\nKing Kloseu himself appeared in public for the first time in months, wary of red assassins lurking in the shadows and nervously glancing around him. Yet he mustered his courage and appeared on stage in the central square, which was packed full of griffons who had mere weeks ago been innocent civilians. To ensure everyone could hear the King, a Wingbardian microphone and a loudspeaker had been placed on stage, one of the only ones in Prywhen and as expensive as a mansion. Kloseu approached the microphone, cleared his throat and spoke.\n\n"My dear subjects! You all must know that I would not force you to fight if the situation was not most dire and desperate. Indeed it is, for communist scum have beaten back our armies and are approaching us, eager to loot, burn and pillage. Do you now understand? You will be forced to fight no matter what; Be thankful I have given you guns to defend yourself and your families with."\n\nSuddenly Kloseu's purple eyes lit up with fury."And if any of you think otherwise, that the communist filth are liberators and bringers of peace and prosperity, I will say to you: What utter fools you are! They care for nought but creating their utopia no matter the cost. Otherwise, would have they ruined our country? Would have they burned our fields? Would have they murdered their brothers for staying loyal to me? Would have they murdered my gentle and loving wife?!"\n\nKloseu was panting heavily, a tear flowing down his cheek into his scar. "Trust me, my brave subjects, you will receive no mercy from those barbarians. Give them none in return! Now onwards, to the barricades! Defend your homes and families at all costs! And do not fear death, for Arcturius is waiting for you all in the afterlife!"\n\nFor the first time in a decade, a huge crowd was cheering for Kloseu and chanting his name. He smiled, proud of his griffons."

Many ideas and suggestions were shared, yet most of them were deemed impractical, overly ambitious or simply moronic. In the end, though, one plan emerged: Requesting foreign assistance.\n\nWhile some officers such as Lexandru were too proud to admit it, we are weak alone, with our economy in tatters and the enemy controlling half the country. Yet we don't have to be alone. Surely, foreign nations will recognize the threat of Redglad's radical revolution and send us immediate aid. We can especially look to Wingbardy, for the Talonuel dynasty is an old friend of the de Kissaus and will certainly help us in our darkest hour. For us to receive any aid from them, we must hold the port of Sydia at all costs."

brodfeld_rework.7.d:0 "Prywhen has been saved from the tyranny of communism and the liberty of its griffons is, for now, safe and secure. But victory has come at a terrible cost, for the country lies in ruins, thousands lay dead and most educated Prywhenians live as refugees abroad. Therefore, it is not odd to witness apathy on the streets even as news of triumph spread. For most commoners, the end of the war makes little difference to their miserable and impoverished lives as they bury their loved ones and continue their daily struggle to survive.\n\nNevertheless, the King had ordered a military parade to be held in Kivessin, hoping to lift the spirits of his subjects. Many griffons attended, only to witness rows upon rows of underequipped and underfed soldiers marching in poor order while military bands played overly pompous music. The golden standards of Brodfeld they carried were torn and dirty. Prince Tomado, who watched the parade with his father, couldn't help but feel that the banners symbolized Prywhen itself."

brodfeld_rework.9.d:0 "To ensure the stability and integrity of Brodfeld, our soldiers and militiagriffons have arrested anyone suspected of being a supporter of PCP, GLA or any other communist or socialist organization. Often, family members of suspects were detained as well, regardless of their age. Last time this was attempted it ended up sparking a civil war, but now the strength of the reds has been shattered and they are unable to resist.\n\nThousands of new prisoners have been brought to already cramped prison camps across the nation, with the largest ones being in Larios and White Flower which hold tens of thousands of prisoners of war. Everyone will remain detained until each individual's role in the Civil War has been thoroughly investigated. Those who took up arms and fought will certainly be convicted of treason and thus receive harsh sentences.\n\nDeath rates are high as malnutrition and disease ravage the crowded camps. Countless griffons are executed each day without trial. Mass graves near the camps fill quickly."

brodfeld_rework.58.t:0 "Day of Judgement"
brodfeld_rework.58.d:0 "The captured leaders of GLA were the first to face trial. The King himself, along with his son Tomado, travelled to White Flower's prison camp to witness the proceedings. The suspects, in face of overwhelming evidence, were all convicted guilty of high treason and were sentenced to die. While initially they were to be hanged, His Majesty barked in anger that they deserved a harsher punishment and demanded their impalement, which shocked everyone, especially the convicts and the Prince. Kloseu himself had banned impalement some years after the Kingdom was founded, but it seems he had changed his mind about the matter since.\n\nGeneral Ion Soimescu ordered his hesitant soldiers to obey at once. While the whereabouts of the devil Filip Redglad are unknown, his second-in-command Richard Spear had been captured and was the first to be executed. Before his impalement he mockingly saluted the King and said "Long live the revolution!". One by one the traitors were killed. Cynthia, Brandon, Koldvin. The last convict, Theresa, glanced at the Prince, her eyes distraught with terror. The Prince gave her a pitiful sigh in return and averted her gaze.\n\nAs soldiers carried her to the sharpened iron pike, she managed to get loose from their grasp and ran to Tomado. She fell on her knees in front of him. "I beg you, Prince, I know your father is a stranger to mercy, but surely you're better than him! I don't claim to be innocent, but I repent and beg for forgiveness! If you pardon me, I swear to never betray my country again!"\n\nIon Soimescu immediately pulled out his pistol and was ready to shoot her before Tomado stepped in front of him. He turned to his furious father and said "She genuinely regrets her actions and asks for a royal pardon. If you do not give her a chance, then I no longer wish to be an heir to such a cruel and tyrannical griffon."\n\nKloseu silently glared at his only child in both surprise and anger, his fists clenched.\n\n"Fine," he spat out. "She shall live. For now"."

brodfeld_rework.8.t:0 "The Deportation"
brodfeld_rework.8.d:0 "Unlike the purge of communists, the banishment of democrats received less support among our subjects. Members of the Golden Guard on the other claw strongly agreed with the King and used the opportunity to spread anti-democratic propaganda. They justified the exile by drawing parallels to Aquileia, where democrats plotted with socialists and communists to overthrow the Discret dynasty via violent revolution. Clearly, the exile was a necessary action to secure peace in Prywhen.\n\nPrince Tomado travelled to Sydia, accompanied by a small group of royal guards. The crowded harbour was filled with deportees and ships ready to carry them abroad to countries such as Sicameon and Gryphus. With hasty steps, he went to the ship headed to Wingbardy and was greeted by soldiers.\n\n"Greetings. What brings you here, Prince?"\n\n"I must find a griffon called Enrico Chivaldori. At once."\n\nThe soldiers nodded and obeyed; one read the passenger register while another went into the crowd, shouting the name. Eventually Enrico was found and brought before Tomado. He was wearing a black suit and his signature hat, and carried a suitcase with all of his belongings. When he saw the Prince, his eyes widened.\n\n"Tom? What brings you here? I was just about to board the ship!"\n\n"You're not going anywhere, friend." Tomado gave one of the soldiers a letter with a golden royal seal. He opened it and read it aloud: "I, King Kloseu de Kissau of Brodfeld, hereby grant a royal pardon to Enrico Chivaldori."\n\nEnrico opened his mouth in shock. "What? H-how...?"\n\nThe Prince smiled warmly. "Had to argue with my father for an hour to get him to sign this. You can stay, Rico.""

Never before had he been courageous enough to tell his father what he truly thought of him, but recent events had changed that.\n\n"Come in," said his father, so he entered. The King was frowning, as he had always been since his wife had been assassinated. "What do you want now? Another royal pardon for another traitor?"\n\n"No. I wanted to tell you what I think about everything that has happened in recent years."\n\nKloseu rolled his eyes. "Fine. Be quick. I have a royal banquet to plan."\n\nTomado sighed, closed his eyes and spoke. "Father, I cannot help but feel like everything was ultimately caused by you. The famine was caused by your trade policy, the assassination of my mother was caused by you assuming dictatorial powers and the civil war was caused by you hunting the communists, even though the griffon responsible for the assassination had been shot and killed immediately. You were hunting innocents for no reason, so they rebelled."\n\nKloseu's purple eyes burned with anger, the scar on his cheek twisting as he grimaced. "How dare you? How dare you say things like that?!" He stood up and slammed his fist on the table. Tomado was startled, but quickly regained his composure.\n\n"Father, I am sorry, but I felt like I had to tell you my honest opinion. You keep trying to do things right but you keep failing and hurting our griffons, which only makes you worse. After the... impalements, I wasn't sure if I even wanted to call you father anymore. It's as if a changeling had taken his place. What would my mother say if she saw you now? Don't you think you've gone too far?!"\n\nHis Majesty calmed himself and sat down on his chair.

Visitors arrived from all over Prywhen and beyond, with members of every noble house attending along with foreign dignitaries. In addition, a surprisingly large number of military officers attended, many of whom were notable members of the Golden Guard. The King greeted everyone personally, shaking their claws as their entered, his son standing beside him. The King smiled, yet Tomado's gaze was absent and he barely spoke.\n\nThe dinner's program consisted of a six course meal (which the King especially enjoyed), a musical performance conducted by the Wingbardian-Brodfeldian maestro Enrico Chivaldori, an hour of dancing and a five course meal (which the King also enjoyed). After the sun had set, the King held a speech as the guests enjoyed the finest Sicameon wine.\n\n"My dear friends! I hope you have all enjoyed my banquet. Let this be a sign to you all that a new age of bliss and prosperity has begun in Brodfeld! Indeed, if it wasn't for our brave soldiers, we would not be standing here right now. Their brave sacrifices and their determination to save our country from godless communists impress even Arcturius Himself. Therefore this feast is held in their honour! In my warriors of gold I can trust, for I know they will defend Prywhen from without and within for many years to come."\n\nKloseu's burning violet eyes were especially focused on the foreigners and the nobles.\n\n"Let he who conspires to destroy Brodfeld know that we will not give in easily! A baptism of fire have we survived and it has made us strong. Nothing shall break our Kingdom! Long live Brodfeld! Eviliana watches over us!"\n\nKloseu pounded his chest with his fist, then raised it high. When the officers in the audience saw this, they did the same and shouted "Hail Kloseu! Long live the King! Long live Brodfeld!". The other visitors appeared uncomfortable, especially the foreigners, and the Prince left the room with hasty steps."

When he finally came to the balcony and greeted his subjects, he was accompanied by his son Tomado.\n\n"Griffons of Prywhen! Long have you suffered under my rule, and at last I am willing to admit it. I am no God and am thus flawed just like any griffon, and have made many mistakes in my life. Now it is time for this to change! It is time for you to control your own fate. I hereby announce that the state of emergency has been lifted and a new liberal constitution has been ratified. Brodfeld will from now on be a constitutional monarchy, like that of distant Feathisia. I will not abdicate, but my responsibilities and powers have been greatly reduced. The senate will be expanded and its members will not be appointed by me, but elected by you. My dear griffons, after everything that has happened, you deserve to be free!"\n\nThe crowd stared at the King in silent shock for a moment, before some griffons cheered in jubilation and praised the King. The joy soon spread and everyone chanted "Long live the King! Eviliana bless you!"\n\nKloseu smiled and turned to his son, who was watching the celebrating crowd with teary eyes.\n\n"Thank you, son," Kloseu said and embraced him tightly."

brodfeld_rework.13.d:0 "For the first time in the long history of Prywhen, an election was held for who would govern the griffons, instead of the matter being decided with violence. Among the candidates were not only nobles, but many commoners of all walks of life as well, both male and female. Voter turnout was at 60% as many griffons were still hesitant about the drastic and sudden change. The most important position being filled was that of the Prime Minister, who would lead the government and have more power than the King himself.\n\nOn the day when the results of the vote were to be revealed, Prince Tomado paid a visit to his friend Enrico Chivaldori who lived in Sydia. Encouraged by Tomado and supported by his party PNL (or what remained of it after the eviction), he had reluctantly stood for nomination for the position of Prime Minister.\n\nTomado knocked on the door of his apartment, which opened after a moment. Enrico smiled when he saw Tomado and the two embraced each other. The Prince ordered his bodyguards to stay outside and went in with his friend. The two sat down together after Enrico prepared some tea.\n\n"So, what brings you to my humble abode, friend?" Enrico asked.\n"The election, of course. The results will be revealed today, and I know you're nervous about it. I came here to calm your nerves and celebrate with you when you win." He grinned, winked and sipped the tea.\nEnrico sighed. "Come on, Tom, I'm not going to win. I'm a son of a migrant from Wingbardy and a former music teacher, and I almost got kicked out of the country."\n"None of those are bad things. Prywhenians trust foreigners more than each other, having a humble civilian background makes you more relatable and my pardon has given you special attention and empathy. Not to mention the only other serious candidates are Beam Bruno and Miguel Cordona, neither of which are as popular as you."\nEnrico shook his head and drank some tea. "Maybe, I don't know. Even if I win, I'm not sure I have what it takes to run a country, especially one that has been torn by civil war."\n"Rico, don't sell yourself short. You have many great ideas and a gentle heart. You'll be a great Prime Minister." Tomado took Enrico's violin from a cabinet and gave it to him. "Play some music. I know it always calms you down."\nEnrico smiled in response, took it and began to play."

He seemed more confident and secure than during the war, and his paranoia of communist assasins appeared to have dissipated completely. He had also gained weight, but his furious, determined gaze prevented anyone from mocking him.\n"Griffons of Prywhen! For a while now have we enjoyed re-established peace, but we cannot simply rest on our laurels much longer. The threat of war looms even now over us, dark and foreboding, but this threat does not only come from within, but from without. Communism is not a plague that was born in Prywhenian soil, but abroad, and beyond our borders the sore of Griffonkind festers still."\n\nThe crowd still expected him to say what he would do to about the wide-spread damage and societal rifts caused by the civil war.\n\n"This is why we cannot simply sit and do nothing, my dear subjects! The red beast is a hydra with many heads, and if one is severed another takes its place. And not only do the reds threaten us, but war-mongers and self-proclaimed liberators as well. The entire world stands against us, seeking to destroy our nation. Conflict is therefore inevitable, war is inevitable, suffering is inevitable. We must prepare or else we will die, for only the strong can resist the coming tide. But worry not, for our nation is strong and can withstand any storm. And every storm has to end and be followed by a peaceful, golden day. The hope of victory in our hearts must never die! Brodfeld shall prevail!"\n\nFor a brief moment the crowd was silent and in deep shock, but then members of Golden Guard among the crowd began furiously clapping and cheering, and other griffons soon joined until most of them were praising the King loudly. Ion Soimescu squinted and spotted those who did not share their patriotic enthusiasm and whispered to Lexandru to get his soldiers ready. Traitors to the King would need to be interrogated at once."

Kloseu's heart had become dark and bitter, unable to truly trust anyone. All the troubles during his reign were not his fault, he thought, but the fault of others. Nobles had taken advantage of his open trade policies, the peasants he had personally liberated only suffered more and the order he had restored after the famine required him to hoard power, which made democrats and communists bitter.

As rioters filled the streets, lead by the disgruntled nobility and his own son, Prince Tomado, he prepared an emergency meeting with his generals. There was no fear or doubt in his eyes. No, he seemed pleased with the recent events, as if he could take advantage of them.\n\nIon Soimescu, his most trusted general, spoke first. "My dear Conducator, Leader, what should we do? Thousands of protesters have occupied or burned down factories and government buildings across the nation. They demand reforms and liberalism, clerly poisoned by traitorous, revolutionary thought. Should I order the army to eradicate them?"\nGeneral Lexandru Leuescu shook his head. "No, you fool, that would lead to another civil war, surely! We must be careful, as if we were handling a bomb. They need to be dealt with but with a more lenient claw."\n\nKloseu looked at each griffon in turn, completely silent and clasping his claws. Then, he finally revealed his plans..."

He would get his sweet revenge and make every single foe suffer.\n\nBesides vengeance and justice, the King desired to benefit from the destruction of his foes.

Prelate Denali promised to forgive them for their sins and gave them Arcturius' blessing.\n\nThe infiltrators wore civilian clothing and joined the large protesting crowd in the center of Kivessin. Prince Tomado was standing on a box and holding a passionate speech to them, saying the King had gone mad with power and should abdicate. Protestors shouted "Bread and peace!" along with democratic slogans. The assassins hid their disgust well and made their way through the masses. The Prince had no bodyguards and was surrounded by his most ardent supporters. One of the infiltrators, a female griffon, shouted how much she loved and admired the Prince, and how he should become their benevolent King. As everyone was distracted by her, another assassin crept behind the Prince and kicked the box from under his paws. He fell on the ground and the crowd gasped in shock. The assassin then kneeled besides him, worry in his face, asking if he was okay. Tomado mumbled that his back hurt but that he was otherwise fine. Tears in his eyes, the assassin embraced the Prince, begging for his forgiveness. Tomado soon took his final breath as a concealed syringe entered his flesh. The assassin pretended to be shocked and said the Prince's head had hit the paving and that he needed immediate medical assistance. Dozens of griffons wailed in terror and came to aid him and carry him to the hospital. Little did they know it was too late.\n\nAs the assassination took place, King Kloseu visited his wife's tomb in the Temple of Eviliana. He wept, saying their son had betrayed them, apologized for being a bad father who had let their child fall so low, and kissed the tombstone.\n\nSeveral days later news spread that the Prince had died. King Kloseu announced that should he pass away as well, General Ion Soimescu would assume control of the country. The royal Brodfeldian line of de Kissau would be extinguished, but at least Prywhen would have a strong, legitimate leader."

But he cared little for security, having no bodyguards. The task was therefore easy to fulfill.

The door opened and a soldier pushed Tomado inside. He showed no signs of resistance and was completely unharmed. When he saw the stern gaze of his father, he looked down on the ground.\n"Look me in the eyes, son," Kloseu spat out. "I am very disappointed in you. In fact, part of me does not want to call you 'son' anymore."\nTomado hesitantly lifted his gaze to meet his. "I-I am sorry father, but I had no choice. You refused to listen to me before. I am doing this for your good and the good of our people."\n"The good of our people? Causing chaos and burning down buildings is for the good of our people?!"\n"Destruction of military factories? Yes. They don't want another war."\n"At this rate you will begin another war! Do you really want a second civil war so soon after the first one?!" Kloseu shouted, standing up from his chair.\n"No. I admit that some protesters... got out of claw. It's hard to control them all."\n"It is not hard. You are just too weak to rule them like a King. Son, being a ruler is about having unquestionable authority. I realized this long ago and have done everything I can so my subjects don't fight back against me, and now I am on the brink of finally succeeding."\n"Maybe because your subjects don't want you to succeed? Maybe they want to rule themselves and decide their own future?"\n"Tomado, while thousands rallied behind you, millions more remained in their homes. They're tired of conflict and chaos. Only an iron claw can ensure it in these dark times. But authority does not mean cruelty. I do not wish to be a tyrant. I only want to ensure my subjects are safe and happy, and am willing to die for that cause."\n"Really?"\n"Yes, son. I do not pursue power for its own sake. Everything I've tried to do, the deeds that make you think I am a monster, were intended to further this goal. I cannot claim to be perfect, but I sure as Tartarus can claim to be determined."\nTomado sighed deeply. "Father, I... I am sorry. I did not understand.""

brodfeld_news.2.t:0 "Brodfeld Declares Crusade Against Communism"
brodfeld_news.2.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Several news reporters from across the world witnessed a peculiar event in the capital of Brodfeld earlier today. King Kloseu held a speech to a huge, enthusiastic crowd where he declared a crusade against all communist nations in the world, saying the Gods themselves were on their side. He compared communism to cancer that spread and had to be cured before it was too late. Considering how devastated Prywhen was after the Civil War, this opinion was somewhat understandable. At the end of the speech he said "the Gods will it!", which has now become a common motto in the nation, shouted by soldiers and civilians alike as they prepare for "the final struggle"."
brodfeld_news.2.a:0 "Monarchist loony... Ready our defences!"
brodfeld_news.2.b:0 "Death to communism!"
brodfeld_news.2.c:0 "Has King Kloseu gone insane?!"

### OLD EVENTS ###
prywhen.2.t:0 "Request Help?"
prywhen.2.d:0 "The filthy communists have the upper claw over us and we need to resort to extreme measures. None of the neighbouring nations wish to participate in this war on our side, but in this desperate hour we shall send a call to arms to the outlaws of Blackrock and promise them a share in the spoils of war. Loot is the only thing those brutes desire, after all."
prywhen.2.a:0 "Do it."
prywhen.2.b:0 "We cannot trust those savages!"

#Event for bandits
prywhen.3.t:0 "Help Brodfeld?"
prywhen.3.d:0 "The Kingdom of Brodfeld is getting their beak kicked in by the Griffon Liberation Army. It was no surprise then to get a message from the King where he very nicely asks for our help in their war (you could tell the niceness wasn't really genuine). While supporting Brodfeld is not necessarily what we want to do, stopping the spread of communism certainly is. We don't want Redglad's gang to liberate the peasants from our rule, do we?"
prywhen.3.a:0 "Time to put the Reds in their place!"
prywhen.3.b:0 "If the commies win, let them come. We don't fear them."

prywhen.4.t:0 "The Bandits refuse to help"
prywhen.4.d:0 "Blackrock and her thugs have responded to our request for help. Sadly, they do not see the urgency of the situation and refuse to help us in our struggle against the communists."
prywhen.4.a:0 "Bah, we don't need their help anyways!"

brodfeld.1.t:0 "Foreign Military Aid?"
brodfeld.1.d:0 "While none of our neighbours wish to directly intervene in the conflict which in their eyes is an internal matter, perhaps we can gain indirect aid from them. After all, if the communists win, they will spread their wicked revolution and bring ruin to their fair countries."
brodfeld.1.a:0 "Yes, send messengers to all of our neighbours!"

brodfeld.2.t:0 "Brodfeld Requests Military Aid!"
brodfeld.2.d:0 "Another request for aid arrived from Brodfeld today. They urgently ask for military aid of any kind and describe in detail what atrocities the communists have committed, saying they must be stopped at all costs. They also say that if the red revolution succeeds, it will spread like cancer to us as well. Should we assist the King?"
brodfeld.2.a:0 "Send support! The reds must be stopped!"
brodfeld.2.b:0 "It's their problem."

brodfeld.3.t:0 "Foreign Military Advisors Arrive!"
brodfeld.3.d:0 "Foreign advisors and volunteers have arrived to support us! The advisors are veterans with extensive knowledge of tactics and strategy while the volunteers are eager to fight for our cause. We stand united against the Red Menace which seeks to undo all that we hold dear."
brodfeld.3.a:0 "Great!"

brodfeld.3.t_not_arrived:0 "No One Sent Aid!"
brodfeld.3.d_not_arrived:0 "Out of all our neighbours, nobody provided any help to us! They are too foolish to recognize the threat posed by Redglad's bandits."
brodfeld.3.b:0 "All of you will regret this!"

brodfeld.4.t:0 "Foreign Economic Aid?"
brodfeld.4.d:0 "One of our few advantages over the communists in the war is our control of the two major cities in Prywhen, Sydia and Kivessin. Yet we are unable to fully tap into this industrial potential, for our economy has crumbled and we lack the funds to support our industry. We will now ask our neighbours to provide economic aid, emphasizing that it will help the suffering griffons of Prywhen. This is not a lie, of course, but it will also help with the war effort."
brodfeld.4.a:0 "The telegraph wires will be busy tonight..."

brodfeld.5.t:0 "Brodfeld Requests Economical Help"
brodfeld.5.d:0 "The Kingdom of Brodfeld is fighting a bloody civil war against communist peasant rebels. The leaders of the Kingdom beg us to help the suffering economy of the country, which has been almost completely devastated by the conflict and has left thousands languishing in poverty."
brodfeld.5.a:0 "Of course! We must help the poor griffons!"
brodfeld.5.b:0 "They just want help against the rebels, don't they..."

brodfeld.6.t:0 "Foreign Economic Aid Arrives!"
brodfeld.6.d:0 "Today we have thankfully received funds from abroad, brought by heavily guarded ships and caravans. We must invest these coins in our industry and hire more workers and researchers to our civilian and military factories."
brodfeld.6.a:0 "The King will be in debt... of gratitude!"

brodfeld.6.t_not_arrived:0 "No One Sent Money!"
brodfeld.6.d_not_arrived:0 "It seems even trying to evoke pity did not help, for our neighbours refuse to send any funds to us."
brodfeld.6.b:0 "You greedy bastards!"

brodfeld.7.t:0 "Marsh Warbands"
brodfeld.7.d:0 "The Terrible Marsh is a desolate and cursed wasteland inhabited by few. Even before the war our control of the region was tenuous, limited to the rich oilfields in the outskirts of the swamps. We know that tribes of savages inhabit the magical, beast-infested marshes, and while they are backwards, they could still help us with the war.\n\nTherefore we sent a squad to sail along the Evi river and try to contact these tribes, and it seems they were successful. Tribal warbands have emerged from the marshes, armed with muskets our soldiers had brought them, ready to kill everything in sight. This will certainly be a surprise for the red filth!"
brodfeld.7.a:0 "Excellent! Promote everyone in that squad."

brodfeld.8.t:0 "Operation: Boiled Rice"
brodfeld.8.d:0 "While we are beginning to run out of food, so is our cursed enemy. To win the war, it will be necessary to sabotage their ricefields so their next harvest will fail miserably! Infiltrators have been sent to arm and organize local peasants, who are furious about the communists' confiscation of their private farms. Together, they will begin a campaign of sabotage and terror, burning down the new property of GLA and forcing them to divert troops away from the frontline. This might be just what we need to turn the tide of the war!"
brodfeld.8.a:0 "The bastards won't be having any boiled rice next winter."

brodfeld.10.t:0 "Foreign Engineers?"
brodfeld.10.d:0 "After several years of brain-drain we lack educated engineers. Without them, our industry does not operate at full capacity. Any engineers of ours who fled the country will certainly not return until the war is over, so perhaps we should attempt to replace them with foreign ones. Out of all the nearby nations, only the Kingdom of Griffonstone and the Free Towns of Gryphus are civilized enough to have spare engineers, so we should send messages to them."
brodfeld.10.a:0 "Let us hope their answer will be positive."

brodfeld.11.t:0 "Brodfeld Requests Our Engineers!"
brodfeld.11.d:0 "A message has arrived from Kivessin, requesting the help of our talented engineers. They would assist with their civilian economy only and return once the conflict has ended and Brodfeld's own refugee engineers come back home."
brodfeld.11.a:0 "Seems like a reasonable request."
brodfeld.11.b:0 "We will not send our most talented minds to a war zone!"

brodfeld.12.t:0 "Foreign Engineers Arrive!"
brodfeld.12.d:0 "After a long trip, foreign engineers have arrived in Sydia, eager to work for us and aid our ailing industrial sector. Their expertise will be a boon to our war effort!"
brodfeld.12.a:0 "Thank you Griffonstone!"
brodfeld.12.b:0 "Thank you Gryphus!"
brodfeld.12.c:0 "Thank you both!"

brodfeld.12.t_not_arrived:0 "No Engineers For Us..."
brodfeld.12.d_not_arrived:0 "The responses, sadly, were both negative. Neither Griffonstone nor Gryphus wish to send their engineers to us, stating that it is too dangerous for them to go to a country embroiled in a civil war. They are not wrong, of course, for that is the reason our own engineers left..."
brodfeld.12.e:0 "Curse them both!"

brodfeld.13.t:0 "Tank Quest!"
brodfeld.13.d:0 "There are rumours that the Skyfall Trade Federation purchased several armoured mechanical beasts from ponyland over the ocean. Those machines spit fire and can drive on their own. Their government recently constructed a military factory and started manufacturing the magical creations in secret, away from the public eye. Luckily, one of the federal officials spilled the beans to our prince's mother-in-law, who is a daughter of burgmeister of Fezera and was visiting Skyfall. We should embark a party for the journey and sail west to acquire one of the few models. This might as well be the key to our victory in the civil war. The speed of the operation and reliance of the pirate ship crew that we managed to hire, as they were the only ones willing to do the mission, will depend on the amount of pay."
brodfeld.13.a:0 "Let them feel like kings!"
brodfeld.13.b:0 "Buy them rum!"
brodfeld.13.c:0 "We can't give them much."
brodfeld.13.e:0 "For Gods' sake, we can't waste time on nonsense!"

brodfeld.14.t:0 "The Miracle Weapon Has Arrived!"
brodfeld.14.d:0 "The journey ended and the pirates kept their word, they didn't run away with the money. What's more important, they brought back a present for us! We shall organise a new division and push the beast to battle! Let the miracle weapon lead us to victory!"
brodfeld.14.a:0 "Hurraah!"
brodfeld.14.b:0 "Hurra-- Wait, the communists have seized Sydia? No!"

#Likely no longer used ['likely' :gallus:]
brodfeld.15.t:0 "The Civil War Is Over!"
brodfeld.15.d:0 "Since the last communist forces have capitulated, we are ready to begin our rehabilitation."
brodfeld.15.a:0 "Great."

brodfeld.21.t:0 "The Civil War Is Over!"
brodfeld.21.d:0 "After a long struggle, the civil war has at last come to an end. Yet the suffering continues, for our once fair and beautiful country lies in ruin. Food prices are sky-high, trade has come to a halt and the infrastructure is badly damaged. Now we must rebuild and recover, as well as punish the scum responsible for the devastation."
brodfeld.21.a:0 "Brodfeld shall prevail!"

brodfeld.22.t:0 "Peasants of Prywhen!"
brodfeld.22.d:0 "Soldiers went out to villages and towns across Prywhen, gathered the locals and read out loud the following message, written by the King himself:\n\n"Hear my plea! I call to you to defend your homeland from the traitors that have been ravaging this land for years! These brutes wish to take away your precious farmland and give it to vile robbers and peddlers, all in the name of equality. They seek to undo the natural order of the world, for in their eyes all are equal. They say you, hard-working and proud peasants of Prywhen, are as lowly as your ignorant young sons, cruel bandits in the woods and lazy beggars in the towns. Do you wish to live in such a society? Or will you stand with me against this insanity? You, my dear subjects, shall be enlisted in the royal army of Brodfeld! Today!"\n\nThousands of griffons cheered enthusiastically, yet thousands of others remained silent, fear in their eyes. What should we do?"
brodfeld.22.a:0 "Conscript as many as possible!"
brodfeld.22.b:0 "Don't conscript too many."
brodfeld.22.c:0 "A thousand is enough."

brodfeld.23.t:0 "Peasants of Kivessin!"
brodfeld.23.d:0 "Soldiers travelled to villages near the capital, gathered local peasants and read out loud the following message, written by the King himself:\n\n"Hear my plea! You worked hard on the fields around the capital for many years! You fed yourself, the lord and the royal family. Now, you have a chance to defend your land, defend your kin and the king, who is sweating it right out to care about you! The red bandits are coming. They are going to slaughter you, burn your villages and steal your lands. Do not let them do this! To arms!"\n\nHundreds of peasants eagerly shouted "Long Live the King!", yet hundreds of others said nothing, doubt in their eyes. What should we do?"

brodfeld.24.t:0 "Peasants of Sydia!"
brodfeld.24.d:0 "Soldiers travelled to villages near Sydia, gathered local peasants and read out loud the following message, written by the King himself:\n\n"Hear my plea! The fish that you bring us enriched the tables of the griffons of Prywhen for many years! The crops that you cultivate under the warm southern sun brought cheer and happiness to every loyal subject of mine. Beware now, as the red bandits are approaching this land, there will be no joy anymore. Their claws will take away your land, your food, your shelters. Join the royal army now! That is the only way to stop them!"\n\nHundreds of peasants chanted "Death to Redglad! Death to Communists!" while waving their pitchforks, yet hundreds of others remained quiet, terror in their eyes. What should we do?"

However, the 75th day after the message's arrival finally comes, and in preparation you lock your door and put all your bodyguards on duty for the night. Then you go to sleep, hoping that nothing crazy will take place.\n\nWhen you wake up, you struggle to open your eyes. When you do, you see nothing but blackness. Soon you realize you've been blindfolded, and also feel rope strung around your neck. Is it a noose?\n\nSomeone pulls you up and then pushes you forward. You hear three knocks, and then speech. You can barely make out the words, except for "By the help of Gods, being free and of good report." Then, a door opens and you are pushed forward again. Cold and sharp steel touches your feathery chest, sending shivers down your spine. Whoever is holding the dagger and threatening your life asks: "Do you feel anything?" Stuttering and confused, you respond "Y-yes".\nThe dagger is pulled away and you are pushed to go forward, presumably through the door that was opened. Inside, you are forced to kneel for the first time since Prelate Denali crowned you all those years ago. A number of persons around you begin to speak at once, praying to gods to grant "His majesty" to Masonry so you "may better be enabled to unfold the beauties of true godliness." You are then told to place your right claw on the Holy Book in front of you as someone places an object in your left claw that feels like a compass. "The tome faces East; The compass must face West." You hesitantly obey and stretch your left arm behind you. Finally, you are asked a question.\n\n"What is the predominant wish of your heart?""

You look around yourself. The room is dimly lit with three candles around you and the griffons surrounding you wear hoods. There are three altars, one with the flag of Brodfeld, another with pillars of copper and the third in front of you with the Holy Book.\n\nThe griffon facing you then speaks. "By the grace of the Gods, you are now one of us. The three lights shall now be revealed to you: The Volume of Sacred Law to govern faith, the Square to regulate our actions and the Compass to keep us in bounds with all Griffonkind, especially with fellow Masons. The three lesser lights are Sun, who rules the Day, Moon, who rules the Night, and the Master Mason who rules us. I will also reveal to you that tonight you have already survived two of the three Dangers. If you had not been patient, you would've eagerly rushed into Masonry and been slain by the Dagger. If you had not desired Masonry, you would've tried to run away only to be hanged by the Noose around your neck. The last Danger you must discover yourself in the Parable of Hawkam Abiff, which i will now recite for you."\n"Long ago, King Solomane of Re'em decided to erect a Grand Temple to his Gods. He invited Hawkam Abiff, a famed griffon architect, to be the master of works at the construction. As the temple is nearing completion, three fellowcraft masons from the workforce ambush him, demanding the secrets of a Master Mason. He is challenged by each in turn, and at each refusal to divulge the information he is struck with a mason's tool. The third blow is fatal. His body is hidden by the murderers."\n"Solomane sends out a group of fellowcraft masons to search for Hawkam and they manage to find the body. The three criminals are brought to justice and Solomane informs his workforce that the secret word of a Master Mason is now lost forever."\n"What is the last Danger, Mason of Kissau?""

Dead griffons tell no tales, and therefore death is preferable to blatant openness. This is the risk we all take."\n\nYou were then revealed the Sign, the Grip and Word for the First Degree of Masonry. The sign is holding your right claw on your chest with the flat palm down, the grip is done by applying pressure with a talon on top of the first knuckle, and the word is BOAZ. You were given a Mason's badge and a brick, which you then placed in the northeast corner of the room. Because your heart must contain Charity, you were also told to later melt the gold in your regalia, mint coins out of it and give it to the poor. Finally, you were presented the tools of Masons: a gauge to measure work and a gavel to knock off imperfections. Then you were lead out of the room, down the concrete hallway and outside.\n\nThere you realized you had been inside the dam in White Flower, and that the passage you came out of was secret. You were told to make the Sign for the Sun as it rose above the horizon and swear an oath to follow the rules of the Masons, live like a good and loyal citizen of the world and never reveal any secrets."

brodfeld_rework.159.t:0 "The Meeting"
brodfeld_rework.159.d:0 "Shortly after the Masons assumed public control of Prywhen, Prelate Denali's friendly and calm demenour changed completely. He began ceaselessly ranting about the dangers and sins of Masons whom he called "Maarite worshippers and necromancers". He had never liked the King's appointment of Masons to positions in the government and the military but back then he had not been so vocal and aggressive. It is clear he was now genuinely concerned about what the Masons would do with his homeland. Many griffons rallied behind him, especially when he threatened to expose the secrets of Masons by publishing their rituals and symbols for all to see.\n\nHowever, shortly afterwards he vanished.\n\nRumours began to spread almost immediately, with some claiming that the Prelate had been kidnapped and murdered by the Masons. Anti-Masonic protests were held in Sydia and Kivessin and soon even a political party was formed, although it was a single-issue one. But opposition against the Masons petered out when they announced their plans for the future, which included liberty, democracy and prosperity for all griffons. Later a new pro-Mason Prelate was appointed and most griffons forgot about Denali's curious fate. The Anti-Masonic party fell apart when they elected a Mason as their leader."

brodfeld_rework.160.d:0 "Today a controversial law was passed by the Masons: All griffons were suddenly stripped of their citizenship status and could only regain it by joining a Masonic lodge. This meant they lost countless privileges and protections and became little more than vagrants with extremely limited rights. Services that the Masons had made free for citizens were now unavailable to them, including education and healthcare.\n\nThis, of course, caused massive outrage and the griffons began preparing a huge riot in Kivessin. However the leading figures responsible for organizing it vanished one by one without a trace, and law enforcement cared too little to investigate. Led by the newly appointed Prelate, religious griffons held a counter-protest which amassed a large amount of devout followers. Soon enough voices of dissent had silenced completely and griffons either flocked to join the ranks of the Masons or accepted their grim, poor fates."

A terrorist attack had been made in the central market square in the middle of the day at the busiest hour when griffons were buying fish from fishergriffs. A lone wolf wore a vest filled with explosives and then committed suicide with them, killing dozens of bystanders and causing massive chaos which resulted in additional deaths. Somehow the Masons confirmed the identity and nationality of the attacker mere hours later and confirmed it had been a foreigner sent by their government to turn the citizens of Prywhen against each other and trigger another civil war. The King himself declared this would not stand and gave permission to the Masons to begin a military offensive to punish those responsible.\n\nThose who claimed the attack was an inside job soon disappeared mysteriously."

It seems joining the League of Nations and allowing the Prywhenians to expand their outwardly benevolent organizations into our country was a mistake as the foreigners soon began indoctrinating our officials in secret.\n\nWe must arrest any Masons within our borders, leave the League of Nations immediately and break all diplomatic ties with Prywhen, then prepare for war. The Masons have gone too far in their madness."
brodfeld_rework.168.a:0 "We must depose those cultists!"

brodfeld_rework.169.t:0 "Our Plans Foiled"
brodfeld_rework.169.d:0 "It seems our sacred secrets were not secret enough. The foreigners were too clever and discovered our Plan, much to our dismay. Any Masons in their nation have been arrested and [From.GetNameDef] has officially left the League of Nations. Worst of all, they now seek to invade our fair nation and depose us. They stand against the Will of the Great Architects themselves, and will face their divine wrath."
brodfeld_rework.169.a:0 "Prepare for war. The Gods are with us."

brodfeld_rework.172.t:0 "The Absent King"
brodfeld_rework.172.d:0 "It has been two weeks now since the King vanished without a trace.\n\nMilitiagriffs have searched everywhere they could, servants have been extensively interrogated and private detectives had been hired to investigate the matter. Yet no one could find any clues about the King's whereabouts. Based on all evidence, he entered his bedroom, disappeared into thin air and never left it.\n\nTo avoid complete chaos in the country, His Majesty's son, Prince Tomado, has taken the reins of the government. Already he has promised democratic reforms and elections, much to the dismay of the Golden Guard who have now lost their most generous supporter. However, the Prince promises to step down as soon as his father is found, which should happen very soon, and refuses to assume the title of King."
brodfeld_rework.172.a:0 "Long live the Prince!"

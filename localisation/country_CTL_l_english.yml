 ### FOCUS ###

 CTL_the_1_year_plan:0 "The Yaril's Test"
 CTL_the_1_year_plan_desc:0 "The Chitali season of the early dew has begun, and with it, the Yaril must give an address opening the season, promising boons for the great farmers and aristans of Chital and a restoration of the fractured nation's unity and pride. With the current political situation, however, his words might matter more than ever before."

 CTL_call_up_the_nobles:0 "A Meeting With The Three"
 CTL_call_up_the_nobles_desc:0 "Benjen has a year to fix the problems facing Chital by the next Munpani season - clearly he cannot let the Axis of Chital levy their influence over the Council of Seven at any point in that time. To rectify the issue of Axis influence in the Council, Benjen shall call a meeting for only three of his most trusted advisors, so that he shall only listen to sound policy and rhetoric."

 CTL_deal_with_dannya_shah:0 "Dealing With Dannya Shah"
 CTL_deal_with_dannya_shah_desc:0 "Under the leadership of revolutionary firebrand Dannya Shah, the Chitali People's Liberation Front and its communist allies have continued to grow in power. If we are to quash the growing support for this new ideology of chaos and destruction, we must first send a message to those who would be foolish enough to support them - starting with ending the revolutionary agitation of Dannya Shah."

 CTL_seer_issue:0 "A Summit With The Godi"
 CTL_seer_issue_desc:0 "Traditional Olenian godi still hold positions of high importance at the court of the Yaril, but their presence has been a subject of debate for a long time now. Their influence is upsetting to our native subjects, and their close ties to Jakob the Grey's traditionalist faction worries many of the minor nobility, who fear their power will be threatened. It is finally time to decide once and for all the role of these holy deer."

 CTL_sikh_issue:0 "Dealing With The Tuymaiyānatu"
 CTL_sikh_issue_desc:0 "For hundreds of years, a native religious sect known as the "Tuya" has existed on the political fringe of Chital. In these trying times, the Tuya's charitable actions, as well as its militant defiance of our regime, has attracted new members. Most dangerously, Bhushan the Brash himself, is an adherent. We must address what to do about this movement and fast." 

 CTL_the_fate_of_the_council:0 "Dealing With The Council"
 CTL_the_fate_of_the_council_desc:0 "The Council of Seven was created to calm the concerns of the native nobility, but its successes have been mixed. While it has improved native conditions over the years of its existence, many have come to realize it exists just to support the Yaril's power, causing them to lose their faith in its authority. And now, with factionalism taking hold, Benjen needs to make tough choices regarding its future."
 
 CTL_choosing_an_advisor:0 "Favoring A Faction"
 CTL_choosing_an_advisor_desc:0 "The three factions of the Council each hold significant power throughout Chital. The Yaril possesses his own ambitions of reform and reconstruction, but he may yet be swayed by one of the powerful nobles that sit on the council. The future of Chital shall be decided in these negotiation halls and secretive conversations."

 CTL_on_the_berserkers:0 "A Yaril's Reputation"
 CTL_on_the_berserkers_desc:0 "Our Yaril is known as a kind and timid figure throughout all of Chital and beyond. While this personality meshes well with the reform movements, advisors like Jakob the Grey are less than happy about his dissimilarity to his father Benjen IV. Perhaps it is time for the Yaril to try and change?"

 CTL_adding_more_yesdeer:0 "A New Face"
 CTL_adding_more_yesdeer_desc:0 "Currently Benjen lacks a comfortable power base where it matters in Chitali politics, and appointing a new advisor to court the favor of one of the many factions in Chital would sure up his support in crucial ways. Now the only question, is who."

 CTL_appeal_to_the_oleno_hindians:0 "The Southern Delegation"
 CTL_appeal_to_the_oleno_hindians_desc:0 "Even with our administrative reforms, we are still having issues keeping control of the southern regions, one of Benjen's many cousins will lead a delegation to speak with southern leaders from both our government, and local groups. Hopefully, this will help us keep the peace in our most vulnerable land."

 CTL_the_council_of_9:0 "A Council For Nine"
 CTL_the_council_of_9_desc:0 "These times increasingly seem like critical ones in Chital's history, and all factions wish to make a move. With pressure from the entirety of the council, the Yaril will be adding one more seat to the governmental body. Whichever faction fills it, will become far more powerful."

 CTL_the_supply_issue:0 "Supplies Against Socialism"
 CTL_the_supply_issue_desc:0 "The southern lands where communists and rebellious nobles roam have always been hard for the Chitali Yarils to control. And now, when the rebels have access to explosives and canons, our logistics have been thrown into disarray. We must establish a continuous supply line to the southern territories so that we can put down this rebellion."

 CTL_pacify_the_south:0 "Ending The CPLF"
 CTL_pacify_the_south_desc:0 "Loyal military units have tracked down the CPLF's final holdout in the southern hills, and we are ready to finally put an end to this. The Yaril, in accordance with tradition, shall lead his forces personally to battle against the rebels. Chital shall be free of them once and for all!"

 CTL_infiltrate_her_entourage:0 "Infiltrate Her Entourage"
 CTL_infiltrate_her_entourage_desc:0 "Many within the CPLF are not true communists, or even truly dedicated to the overthrow of the Yaril, they are discontent and impoverished deer who may yet be brought back to reason with a little convincing. Royal operatives will be dispatched to infiltrate the CPLF and encourage disunity amongst its ranks, how we go about this though may differ..."

 CTL_the_fate_of_the_ringleaders:0 "An Axis Connection"
 CTL_the_fate_of_the_ringleaders_desc:0 "Dannya Shah always seems to be one step ahead of us, and always has a few more guns then we could have accounted for, these discrepancies in planning and logistics have begun to raise eyebrows at the royal court. A letter found in a spice field, bearing Dannya's seal may give us some answers, though we may find ourselves dealing with something larger than the CPLF."

 CTL_taking_back_the_spice:0 "Reclaim The Spices"
 CTL_taking_back_the_spice_desc:0 "The Spice plantations of inland Chital have always been a source of revenue for whoever controls them. In present, they lie in the hands of the southern rebels who use them to secure funds and arms for their efforts. Reclaiming these plantations would secure our regime much-needed funds for the continued conflict."

 CTL_royal_progress:0 "The Royal Progress"
 CTL_royal_progress_desc:0 "It is time for the Yaril to take a trip throughout the south. He will meet with supporters and dissidents alike to try and firm up his rule.\n\nLet's hope he knows what he is doing."

A brilliant strategist, general, and admiral, Jakob's next modernity to Chital's grand army has been the institution of tanks, a process we must continue."

###INDUSTRIALIST PATH####
CTL_reopen_the_benjen_iv_industrial_bureau:0 "Reopen The Benjen IV Industrial Bureau"
CTL_reopen_the_benjen_iv_industrial_bureau_desc:0 "Recent developments in Chital have alerted us to the disturbing fact that the reforms of Benjen IV, the father of Yarils Aatto and Benjen V, still need massive overhauls to complete their intended goals. Leftovers from the lackluster abolishment of thralldom and incomplete urbanization must be addressed."

CTL_expand_the_bureau_to_science:0 "[Root.GetLeader] Scientific Bureau"
CTL_expand_the_bureau_to_science_desc:0 "The Industrial Bureau's efforts to modernize our nation can not only be limitied to factories and labor reform, our nation is also far beyond the rest of the world in terms of science. And it is time for us to catch up. Opening a scientific wing will be the first step on this path."

CTL_bridging_the_education_gap:0 "Bridging The Education Gap"
CTL_bridging_the_education_gap_desc:0 "While our Northern cities have begun to develop an educated middle class, the same can not be said for the south. It is time to bring our new institutions to the southern provinces in order to ensure they keep pace with the rest of the nation's developments."

CTL_quest_for_skilled_workers:0 "The Quest For Skilled Workers"
CTL_quest_for_skilled_workers_desc:0 "Our population is not skilled in the use of industrial machines. We can have as many factories and drills as we want, but if we can't use them they are without purpose. Opening new trade schools shall educate the population on our new industrial opportunities and how to take advantage of them."

CTL_libraries_of_chital:0 "Libraries Across Chital"
CTL_libraries_of_chital_desc:0 "Establishing a network of free public libraries full of both educational and enjoyable texts will hopefully encourage literacy and education amongst our subjects. Soon Chital shall be known as a nation that looks forward into the future, not backwards to the past."

CTL_agrarianism_through_the_storm:0 "Prioritize Southern Employment"
CTL_agrarianism_through_the_storm_desc:0 "Our economy should remain rooted in the plantations and agriculture of our south. We produce many useful products like tea, rubber, and spices there, and exporting these goods will surely bring us prosperity."

CTL_get_them_to_work:0 "Prioritize Northern Employment"
CTL_get_them_to_work_desc:0 "Our northern factories need further support in order to grow, further subsidies will increase industrial output and lift many of the urban poor out of poverty."

CTL_northern_industrial_primacy:0 "House Baronnen Industrial Grants"
CTL_northern_industrial_primacy_desc:0 "Elik Baronnen, a prominent Northern industrialist and sympathizer of the reformist cause, has offered his support for our government's efforts to reach full employment in the North of Chital. Although his pro-Axis paternalism may prove cumbersome to deal with, there is no doubt that his aid will prove vital to improving our industrial base."

CTL_southern_industrial_primacy:0 "House Kahnli Industrial Grants"
CTL_southern_industrial_primacy_desc:0 "Wasil Kahnli, a flamboyant socialite and aristocrat, and a prominent supporter of the Axis and Eva Pillai, has offered his support for our government's efforts to reach full employment in the South of Chital. Although we cannot be truly sure of his intentions, there is no doubt that his aid will prove vital to improving our industrial base."

###HIRA RAMACHAN PATH###
 CTL_ramachan_takes_control:0 "The Schemes Of Madame Hira"
 CTL_ramachan_takes_control_desc:0 "The unassuming leader of the Axis of Chital, Madame Hira Ramachan, has taken control of the Yarildom following the disbanding of the Council of Seven. With her goals of a broad populist agenda and a centralization of political power for the natives and her allies, Hira will surely not allow the traitors who have driven Chital into the ground to go unpunished."

 CTL_puppet_jarl:0 "A Puppet Yaril"
 CTL_puppet_jarl_desc:0 "Brienna Kudlinen, the Yaril's cousin and younger sister of Jakob the Grey, has never been active in Chitali politics, and after Jakob and Benjen's removal from the political scene, is technically the heir to the Yarildom. To truly stabilize our government, we must bring a Yaril back to Chital, and Brienna is just the right doe for the job."

 CTL_a_few_loose_ends:0 "A Few Loose Ends"
 CTL_a_few_loose_ends_desc:0 "There are some members of the Chitali nobility that are beyond redemption. Supporters of a traditional Olenian aristocracy have continued to oppose our government, and if they ever took control of Chital again, would surely enslave the Hindians once more. If we wish to ensure the stability of the Ramachan government, these traditionalists must be purged."

 CTL_exile_the_heir:0 "Exile The Grey Viking"
 CTL_exile_the_heir_desc:0 "A vicious enforcer of the whims of the Yaril and his predecessors, Jakob the Grey has left a trail of Hindian blood in his wake. While we surely admire his military prowess, there is no need for him to remain in government any longer, as he has shown himself to only be loyal to the Yaril and his own authority. He must be exiled, as he has most certainly overstayed his welcome."

 CTL_send_out_their_secrets:0 "Selling Secrets"
 CTL_send_out_their_secrets_desc:0 "As the court's de-facto Spymistress for years, Hira Ramachan has developed a certain wealth of information pertaining to the hidden desires and controversial political motives of her previous higher-ups. With the people still skeptical of Madame Hira's newfound position of power, perhaps it is the perfect time to reveal the pleasures, deadly intrigue, and corruption of the Chitali nobility."

 CTL_factionalize_the_crown_loyalists:0 "Split The Resistance"
 CTL_factionalize_the_crown_loyalists_desc:0 "The resistance to the Axis of Chital is prone to ideological squabbling of their own, especially the traditonalists and the reformists, who, even with completely different philosophies, have united against Madame Hira and the Axis. Our efforts must be furthered to factionalize the resistance, so that it pains Jakob the Grey and Benjen Davirtannen to even look at eachother."

 CTL_bhushan_as_deputy:0 "Appoint Bhushan As Deputy"
 CTL_bhushan_as_deputy_desc:0 "Bhushan Gurat has served as Ramachan's greatest ally in the government and in the Axis for years. Lord Ivar may be a dignified figurehead for some deer, but Bhushan is the epitome of the spirit of the people of Chital. A protector of the native culture and way of life and staunch agrarian populist, Bhushan is what Chital needs as its deputy, not more prancing nobles with minds only for themselves."

 CTL_work_with_hoversholm:0 "Work With Lord Ivar"
 CTL_work_with_hoversholm_desc:0 "Bhushan Gurat's position in government is a complicated situation, but one thing remains clear - that he is not the correct candidate to serve as Hira's right hand deer, especially because of his radical ideology. Ivar Hoversholm, while a forceful and often disruptive personality, is a comptent administrator and good friend to Madame Hira, and so shall take Bhushan's place as unofficial second-in-command."

 CTL_an_axis_eternal:0 "All Cards On The Table"
 CTL_an_axis_eternal_desc:0 "Chital is the Axis, and the Axis is Chital. With the legacy of the corrupt monarchy of the Kudlinens all but eradicated and a puppet monarch installed loyal to the populist goals of the Axis, it appears that a new dawn is finally in reach for Chital. Now, Hira must turn her eyes to the opposition that still lurks in the shadows... and on the world stage."

 CTL_restructure_the_army:0 "Shatter Viking Priveleges"
 CTL_restructure_the_army_desc:0 "Jakob the Grey and his murderous raiders may have once been an influential part of Chitali society, but now, they are simply a useless relic of Chital's bloodstained past. The high position of these deer in society must end, and their ancient priveleges must finally be abolished, so that an egalitarian Chital can rise."

 CTL_their_outdated_customs:0 "Diplomats On Every Corner"
 CTL_their_outdated_customs_desc:0 "Too many of our Hindian brothers view Chital's leaders as wretched imperialists, who have continued to oppress the natives of our nation even under Ramachan's government. This cannot be further from the truth. Our international policy must entail returning to the world stage as a friend to all Hindians, and an ally to the oppressed of all Zebrica."

 CTL_open_economy:0 "An Economy For The Hindians"
 CTL_open_economy_desc:0 "For too long have the honourable people of Chital been beaten down by an economic and social order that cares only for their own image. We must chart a new course that can end the oppression of our Hindian brothers, but to do so, we must bring in some actual economic advisors not focused on lining their pockets."

 CTL_break_the_system:0 "Tear Down The Council"
 CTL_break_the_system_desc:0 "The Council of Seven is above all, an undemocratic structure, designed to oppress the interests of the Axis of Chital and the Chitali people. It has only served to strengthen the authority of Yaril Benjen and his puppets, all the while maintaing a farce of democratic governance in Chital. The Council of Seven must be abolished, if we are to truly cement the Axis and bring an end to the Yaril's lies."

 CTL_democratic_pretenses:0 "Just And Democratic Pretenses"
 CTL_democratic_pretenses_desc:0 "Hira and the Axis gained power on promises of populism and anti-elitism, and for that reason, it is clear that the Council of Seven and the oligarchic values it represented would be better left in the past. A Chitali Assembly, with elected representatives from across Hindia, would be a better advisory legislature to Brienna I and Madame Hira than any undemocratic privy council could ever be."

 CTL_redistribute_political_power:0 "Begin The Rule Of Law"
 CTL_redistribute_political_power_desc:0 "Should the people of Chital not rule themselves, as they had for centuries before the barbaric Olenians first landed on our fair shores? It should be the deer themselves that decide who reprsents them and what the path of Chital should be, not an unelected Oleno-Hindian minority, and certainly not a Axis of Chital dictatorship that would be just as undemocratic. Democracy must come to Chital!"

 CTL_religious_syncretism:0 "A Syncretist Platform"
 CTL_religious_syncretism_desc:0 "Hira has never been a particularly religious doe, viewing it more as a social and political tool than an actual moral truth. However, Chital is a deeply religious nation, and simply declaring the nation a secular state would inspire mass resistance. Knowing that, we shall use religion as a tool to encourage unity and comradery between all free Hindians of Chital, even if we have to edit some funamental tenets."
 
 CTL_gurus_as_teachers:0 "Protecting Mahimata's Vision"
 CTL_gurus_as_teachers_desc:0 "Mahimata, the mother goddess of Mahimatism, is a core part of Chitali life, and her teachings have guided hundreds of thousands if not millions of Chitalis. Instead of dividing ourselves among Hindian and Olenian lines, we must unite under our common faith and Mahmiata's vision of an agrarian, protected, and integrated Chital."

 CTL_seers_as_propagandists:0 "The Traditionalist In The Room"
 CTL_seers_as_propagandists_desc:0 "Godi Konnar has been reluctant to accept any reforms that remove the dominance of Godi in the Chitali religious scene, continually claiming that they are the only party that can bring about a return to Chital tradition. Unfortunately, he does not seem to be placatable, and continually has held back pro-native and progressive reform. Him and his allies must be marginalized, or somehow... dealt with."

 CTL_a_new_elite:0 "A Better, Hindian, Elite"

 CTL_native_resistance_desc:0 "With support for radical movements exacerbated by the modern movements for harmony, natural rights, and independence throughout the world, the native Chitalis have grown discontent with the current government of Benjen V and the Council of Seven. Many of the natives have begun a policy of complete opposition to the Oleno-Hindian native landed elite, who they believe do not truly represent the people of Chital. If the goverment does not deal with these newfound native tensions quickly, then it could have a crisis on its hooves. With growing support for the Hindian nobility faction in the Council of Seven, the Axis of Chital, along with an increase in militant leftist and republican activity, often sponsored by these same nobles, it is imperative that our government restore balance to Chital, before the Yarildom is swept away by internal turmoil."

Committed to anti-government politics and a desire to change Chital for the better, the Axis supports strengthening Hindian positions and fixing the disparity in power between the landed Oleno-Hindian elite and the commondeer. Given seats on the Council of Seven during the first years of Benjen's reign, the Axis has continued to be a thorn in the monarchy's side, even supporting republican movements at points to sabotage the rule of House Kudlinen.

 CTL_seer_advisor_desc:0 "Dreia of Lavborg, often called the Laughing Priest for his bucking of many ritualistic trends in favor of an accomodating view of the Pantheon and the recruitment of new worshippers, has served as the de-facto second in command of the followers of Ukko in Chital for years. Although they have sparred on theological matters numerous times before, Dreia remains a loyal disciple of Konnar, the leader of the Pantheon's worshippers in Chital, and along with the native Caarlit Lawas, has helped bolster the outreach of the Olenian Gods throughout skeptic urban communities and zealous native ones."
 CTL_noble_advisor1:0 "Andreas Savannen"
 CTL_noble_advisor1_desc:0 "Andreas Savannen has served as a personal aide and advisor to chairdeer of the RMEC Benjen Davirtannen for as long as many Chitali can remember. Considered to be just as intelligent if not more so than his mentor, Savannen has paradoxically made a name for himself as a particularly skilled faceless bureaucrat with little prominent political and social leanings. Unlike Davirtannen, he has kept out of courtly politics, but personally, he holds significant sympathy for the causes of the disgraced Ivar Hoversholm and his mentor both, along with disdain for the scheming nobility of the Ostkranbi."
 CTL_noble_advisor2:0 "Tuomas the Quiet"
 CTL_noble_advisor2_desc:0 "Known for an almost-ritualistic silent nature, Tuomas the Quiet came to court with his good friend and fellow Fraskali noble, Elik Baronnen, but has now become a mind completely of his own. A ruthless enforcer with a habit for cruel and unusual punishment, Tuomas' strength does not lie in his haggard, shadowy appearance, which inspires fear into little, but instead his eerie demeanour and utter disregard for the international codes of harmony."
 CTL_noble_advisor3:0 "Caarlit Samara"
 CTL_noble_advisor3_desc:0 "A bumbling steward and personal confidante of Eva Pillai, Caarlit Samara lies out of place in the Chitali capital. His Oleno-Hindian demeanour, straight from Gondeerana, still carries a lingering effect on his personality that his largely dissipated from Eva's, and as a result, he knows little allies but his old comrade. A competent ally, Samara has served as Eva's eyes and ears in areas the powerful advisor is unlikely to tread."
 CTL_business_advisor1:0 "Ajit Rashigas"
 CTL_business_advisor1_desc:0 "Ajit Rashigas, a business and entrepreneurial mind from the West of Chital, serves as the civilian portion of the Rashigas twins' operations in Chital. Ajit, weaker but more intelligent than his brother, has expressed sympathy and solidarity for Benjen V, Ivar Hoversholm, and Jakob the Grey, with disdain for the methods of the Axis and the percieved "elitism" of Eva Pillai and Davirtannen. A populist sympathizer, Rashigas remains a political wild-card, but would surely find himself at home in most any non-Axis administration."
 CTL_business_advisor2:0 "Gurunath Rashigas"
 CTL_business_advisor2_desc:0 "Gurunath Rashigas, a business and military mind from the West of Chital, serves as the military portion of the Rashigas twins' operations in Chital. Gurunath, stouter and stronger than his brother, is an ally of Ivar Hoversholm within the court, but surprisingly, he has also been seen as a key potential ally of Jakob the Grey. Rashigas, having served as an aide to Hoversholm but collaborator to Jakob in military operations, is a political wild-card, but like his brother, remains independent."
 CTL_military_advisor1:0 "Jashiv Frawar"
 CTL_military_advisor1_desc:0 "Jashiv Frawar is yet another native ally of Jakob the Grey, a position many would believe to be an oxymoron. Frawar, a young "New Noble", has been appointed to numerous bureaucratic and military posts throughout his time in Ostkranbi as part of Benjen V's relentless reshuffling and reform efforts. Paranoid, and known for controversial statements in support of the far-right, Frawar would be an easy ally for Jakob the Grey among Benjen's inner circle, as part of a youth and native faction unlikely to normally support traditionalist politics."
 CTL_military_advisor2:0 "Grasya Kahnli"
 CTL_military_advisor2_desc:0 "Grasya Kahnli, the young commoner wife of industrialist and socialite Wasil Kahnli, has risen from a young, relatively modest courtier in Kahnli's own domain to become one of the most powerful does in Ostkranbi. An ally to Hira Ramachan, Eva Pillai, and her own husband, Grasya is known for her appetite for courtly intrigue and lavish parties and gatherings, which although gratifying to the former commoner, mostly serve as a honeypot for various nobles to spill their secrets to an Axis spy... or for said Axis spies to connect."

A critic of the government whenever it suits him and a loyalist to Benjen whenever it doesn't, Baronnen is a clear supporter of the Axis of Chital's overall vision without clearly establishing himself in opposition to the old Yaril. Within the Axis, he is believed to align himself with Hoversholm and Ramachan's factions as a moderate conservative, and his distrust for Kahnli and Bhushan is well known."
 CTL_da_twink:0 "Wasil Kahnli"
 CTL_da_twink_desc:0 "The young and impulsive Wasil Kahnli, despite his rather obscure heritage and position in the minor nobility, has risen to a key advisory position within the royal court of Ostkranbi ever since he gained the patronage of Eva Pillai. Kahnli, known for his friendly demeanour and flamboyant status, has found a political home within Pillai's faction of Axis sympathizers and market reformers. An opponent to the Yaril's reforms and good friend to both Pillai and spymistress Hira, Kahnli holds little sympathy for fellow industrialist Elik Baronnen, once a key ally at court, or extremists of any sort within the Yarildom."

chital.1.t:0 "Opening The Munpani Season"
chital.1.d:0 "\"...Are you seriously going to deliver this drivel of an Evening Dew address to your cabinet about those fawnhood fantasies of yours? Have you learned nothing from our last heart-to-heart Benjen?\"\n\nThe elderly stag sighed and shook his head in disappointment at the Yaril, the weight of his wrinkles and battle scars only helping to accentuate his evident frown. It was only ironically fitting to have journeyed all the way to Ostkranbi from Gondeerana for the bi-monthly crown speech after having conducted a review of its garrison troops only to witness the Yaril, his very own nephew, once again gush about his ludicrous ideas of \"harmony of the masses\" and \"reform of the classes\" for Chital, he thought to himself.\n\n\"Drivel? Fawnhood fantasies!? Uncle Jakob, you must understand the gravity of the situation at hoof here,\" Benjen replied with a huff of annoyance, the dark bags under his eyes betraying his lack of sleep - and patience - from a white night of writing and rehearsal, \"the Yarildom is in a dire state of affairs, and it is clear that we can no longer present our backs to the Hindians and their needs. We must intervene and provide bread for the poor and a voice to the--\"\n\n\"And embolden those wannabe rebels in the inland with your bleeding-heart ideas?\" Jakob interrupted in his rough voice, \"Benjen, your father would have brought the axe to them to strike them down, and so would his father before him. That speech of yours will simply add logs to the fire if we are not to reaffirm our commitment to strength, tradition and national integrity.\"\n\nBenjen sighed, looking down at the paper he had spent all night painstakingly writing in his hoof. Jakob had always been rigid as a stone in his beliefs, and while the needs of his subjects could no longer be ignored, perhaps his uncle was right about Chital’s past speaking for itself. He then lifted his head and said..."

It bore the cherry red wax seal of Dannya Shah, and its contents may help bring peace to his realm. Opening the document, he began to read...\n\n"To the shadow of Chital,\n\nYou are close to letting your ego get the better of you, I caution you to not probe me for any further action, lest you put our efforts at risk\n\nThough I am thankful for the shipment of weapons, the Yaril came to close to finding them. We'll control the south soon enough and remove the "Kind Viking."\n\nBut when that day is passed, we will need to work out the finer points of this partnership; otherwise, the revolution will not stop with the dynasty of Benjen.\n\nBest Wishes, Dannya Shah"\n\nBenjen blinked a few times and read through the letter again. Who in their right mind would write something like this? At its core, it is a letter to an ally, but why veiled threats? And this "shadow of Chital" talk made Benjen nervous. Though at the same time, he could not help but chuckle at what he read, it truly was a unique specimen.\n\nBut who was this to? Who was providing weapons to the rebels? Wait... the shadow of Chital...\n\n"Could it be Hira?" Benjen wondered to himself, turning to the bed in his study beside him, he spoke to the doe sleeping beneath its sheets. "Ruusu, my dear, could you fetch me a member of the royal police?" The only response from the bed were dreaming groans, "It seems I will need to do this myself." Benjen thought.

chital.28.d:0 "The efforts of Madame Hira to finally syncretize Mahimatism and the associated religions and worships of the Godi of old Olenia have culminated in a great conference at Montaba, with the goal of finally putting the religious divides of Chital to rest.\n\nThe main advisor at Court serving the Godi was Konnar, a staunch follower of Ukko and opponent to what he calls "the primitive pagan rituals of a bygone era". For the past weeks, he has continued to badger Ramachan over her reluctancy to enshrine the Godi as the official leaders of Chitali religious life, declaring that the Yarildom's devotion to the traditional values of Olenian religious culture must come first, before any populist promises or democratic reforms.\n\n"If we give the Mahimatists and their backwards, destructive ideology any more power, they will eradicate the entire vision of the godi as we know it, and make this country some kind of primitivist mother cult devoted to the destruction of all of the gains the Yaril's government has made in the past few years," Konnar had angrily said during the conference, slamming his hoof upon the table, "The Tuya are terrorists, and the Mahimatists have allowed them to operate, cleansing the countryside of all opposition to the Yaril! What Chital needs is tradition, glory, and to be ruled by the Olenians and their Gods again. If any syncretism must be done, I say, Mahimata shall only reign as a goddess within the pantheon, and among equals."\n\nKonnar's doctrine of the supremacy of the Olenian temples, however, have been challenged by others at the court, especially Bhushan Gurat, a member of the Axis of Chital and close friend to Hira Ramachan. Bhushan, a member of the Tuymaiyānatu religious militia and staunch devotee of the Hindian religion, has proposed that if the religions are ever unified, Mahimata should rank above the other gods as a mother figure in accordance with core Mahimatist monotheistic principles.\n\n"Konnar is incorrect, clearly, and continues to spew his propaganda about Mahimatist principles and Mahimata as a goddess," Bhushan declared, "Mahimata is the mother of all Hindians, and the Olenians would only like to see us return to the corrupt modernism of the vapid Olenian temple system. They would have us destroy our lands, end our traditional structures, and eradicate our own culture so that we can return to some kind of "sound" governance." "His ideology is as foolish as it is harmful," Bhushan continued, "And I implore Hira, above all, to enshrine Mahimata as the official head of the pantheon and goddess of Chital.""

chital.29.d:0 "While still maintaining her own power as Chital's Chief Minister and "Diwan", Madame Hira has kept her word on her promises to reform Chital's political and economic systems, and has formally announced for Chital's first legislative elections.\n\nRepresentatives from both Hindian and Olenian constituencies shall elect candidates to Chital's new Assembly, where they shall decide on the day-to-day governance of the nation, subject only to the personal objections of Hira and the young Yaril Brienna, who has already come under the Chief Minister's sway. Although many have raised issues about decaying infrastructure and a long, arduous trip to Chital's capital to serve on the National Assembly, Hira's followers have looked on the move very favorably. With turnout expected to be high in even agrarian areas, Hira's advisors have been hard at work providing for polling infrastructure across Chital's southern territories.\n\nThe Chitali People's Party, founded by a coalition of rehabilitated CPLF members, Hira's personal advisors, and former followers of the Axis of Chital, has positioned itself as a big-tent populist party, supporting land reform, agrarianism, and the Chief Minister. Of course, in the name of national stability, the first election to said Assembly have been populated completely by the followers of the Axis and native politicians and nobles across the country... all members of Chitali People's Party."

chital.30.d:0 ""You may have wondered why I called you here," Hira spoke to her newfound allies at the first meeting of the revitalized Council of Seven, "Well, I shall answer that question here and now."\n\nThe six new repsentatives of the Council glanced at eachother nervously, and then at Hira. All loyalists and sympathizers of the Axis of Chital, Ivar Hoversholm, Elik Baronnen, Bhushan Gurat, and even Eva Pillai, one of Benjen's old enforcers, were called to attend, but Hira had kept the details secretive, as she always did. The only details were that it was of vital importance, and that it would herald in a new dawn for Chital.\n\n"I shall explain our mission to you quickly, before we move onto the direct work of the Council itself. We all know that the original Council of Seven failed in each regard, so much so that Benjen had to start appointing even more and more yesdeer to serve his interests and root out the true voices of Chital. Let us all remember that the idea of the Council of Seven was not inherently bad - of course, we, the nobility and leaders of Chital, should run the nation, but the reckless elitism and disregard for the common Chitali was what set the Council apart as a uniquely disugsting institution."\n\nHira cleared her throat, then continued. "It is for that reason that I have called you here - to rise from the ashes of the old council and bring a new system for Chital, one that does not pretend to support the voices of all Chitali, but one that does what it says it will. A council that prioritizes the people and strengthens its own legitimacy, all at the same time."\n\n"That..." she paused. "Is the Chital we shall build.""

Although many in the court suspect Hira is using Bhushan as a front for her own operations, the new rebellion has taken up the name and flag of the Tuymaiyānatu, a native religious sect determined to protect their lands and faith from what they believe is an encroachment by a foreign Yaril. Bhushan, a staunch member of the organization and one of the movement's leaders, has declared already that Benjen wants "nothing but to see our ancient customs and traditions anihillated under the boot of what he calls progress."\n\nOur scouts believe the Tuymaiyānatu have a significant prescence in Hira's domain in Haarihus, along with Bhushan's in Mahorna. Interestingly enough, Bhushan and his warlords have also managed to take much of the native province of Gondeerana, controlled by Axis sympathizer Eva Pillai. If the native Eva Pillai decides to let the rebels into the city itself, nation-wide turmoil could endure, and the Yaril's reign over all of Chital might even be threatened.\n\nThe situation is grim, and all eyes are on the Yaril's next move to answer the rebellion."

Thankfully, none of those protests reached the site of the port itself, and Aattohamn now stands as a possible landing ground for an invasion of [SRI.GetName], or simply a center of trade to facilitate the mass amounts of Chitali spices exported to Macawia and the Griffonian South.\n\nAlthough debates have erupted on the usage of the port, postponing much of Chital's political activity, one proposal has made its way through - a motion to dedicate Aattohamn to the Chitali workers who built the port town. While squabbling continued on the matter of what the port town should actually be dedicated to, the spirit of the proposal itself has seen widespread support.

No doubt Davirtannen was a symbol of the old regime to Hira, a decadent industrialist with no interest in sharing any of his power with poor Olenian nor any Southern native.\n\nNow, however, that fragile peace between them had been shattered, and Davirtannen found himself before Hira, crowned in the finest regalia fit only for a Princess of Chital, let alone a humble spymistress, and Bhushan and Marsha Gurat, her willing puppets in the grand quest for power that had taken the young deer to rulership.\n\n"Madame Hira," Davirtannen bowed, "I had not expected that you would call upon me now, some months after you had first taken power, not of course that I had any reservations about such a coup. My only duty is to serve Chital, of course, and accomplish the great goals of the Benjen IV Industrial Bureau."\n\nHe forced a smile while Hira entertained a whisper from Bhushan. The delicate little noble who had first been appointed to the position of councildeer so many years ago now seemed a giant, and Davirtannen knew the fate of his operations was all in her hands - Hira's. The famously fickle and jovial lady who spent most her time in public laughing with others, reading and listening cheap Equestrian entertainment, and if the rumors about deviancy were true, certain... other things, was the sole arbiter of the position of the old and weathered industrialist, but Davirtannen wondered if all that fanfare was just an act, a disguise. It didn't matter now. What mattered was her response.\n\n"I have called you hear for many reasons Davirtannen, but hearing your old spiel about service to the crown was unfortunately not one of them," Hira smiled to herself and Marsha Gurat snickered next to her, "The fact is that I have missed exacting the judgement of the Axis upon you, as one of the Council, but I had been pondering your place in Chital for many months."\n\nA pause took the room as Hira chose her next words with careful deliberation:"

You have done more for Chital than any of the prancing elites who pass for industrialists these days, that is for sure."\n\nHoversholm chuckled, and then turned to sign off a seat of paper.\n\n"There," he said, handing the contract to the old bureaucrat, "The state will take a more... active role in your industries, of course, and the name - the name will simply not do."\n\n"How about the Chitali Manufacturing and Electronics Corporation, sir?" Davirtannen finally queried, polite as always.\n\n"A good name for our new partnership," Hoversholm smiled once more, reaching across the table to shake the hoof of CMEC's new CEO - a mutually beneficial alliance that would surely go a long way in securing reform in Chital, Davirtannen knew.

A behemoth I simply can't entertain."\n\n"What do you mean by that, sir?" the bureaucrat said with a tone of fear in his voice, still looking the Kansleri straight in the eyes.\n\n"The RMEC shall be broken up and subsequently fully nationalized," Hoversholm said, "You will no doubt serve the state well in that capacity, and I would welcome you, truly, in the RMEC's current state, it is no better than the monopoly of any Northern oligarch."\n\nDavirtannen continued listening, silent as ever.\n\n"Ah, there are times when your politeness is grating," Hoversholm complained, fishing for answers, "Will you stay with RMEC or retire your house with a nice pension."\n\n"I have reservations about your actions, but, my primary goal will always be to serve Chital."\n\nIn truth, however, Davirtannen knew he had no choice.

Only Ninnesen furrowed her brow and spoke up with a serious response, declaring that Eva had sent notes the previous day about disturbing news in the South - agents of the Chitali government were found dead outside Haarihus, their warrants for Shah's arrest still in their hooves. Eva, of course, had assumed it was the Reds, but Ninnesen and the Yaril both knew Shah no longer had the base to make such bold statements.\n\nIt had to have been Ramachan.\n\nWith Ninnesen and Davirtannen's backing, primitive automobiles set out at dawn to track down the spymistress and find the last known places she had reared her vile head in.

A hasty request for the position of Chief Minister, a denial, a violent reaction from Hoversholm and then an equally brutal one from the Yaril, and then all of it faded. He was humiliated among the court, viewed as nothing but a troublemaker and a fraudster, a schemer with no interest in anything but securing his own power. But what could a deer do but watch and sulk?\n\nFollowing his brief exile he returned again to the royal court as a member of the Axis of Chital, but this time, he was not Ivar the Reformer nor Ivar the Fraudster - he was Ivar the Chameleon, a voice of passion, reason, and kindness to all in court and a voice of snide and condescending disapproval when they were not looking. Contradictions did not matter as long as they were not found out - attacking the Axis to the face of Benjen, then plotting in shadowed meetings with Hira, all the while simultaneously paying lip service to the traditionalist rhetoric of Jakob the Grey.\n\nHoversholm even liked to think he was doing all while not even compromising his values. After all, the dream of a constitutional republic in Chital would not be a product of another failed attempt at power - it would be a product of a whole nation uniting around the most reasonable compromise.\n\nIf all went well, that would always be Hoversholm, and a new vision of peace and justice would finally be brought to the land of the Eastern deer."

It had been the crowning ideal of the reign of Benjen IV to move into the Industrial Revolution as in Equestria and the Griffonian Empire had, and it was the job of Davirtannen to make sure every one of Benjen IV's reforms actually functioned as intended. And work he did, each and every day, to make sure Benjen V did not have to bear the public relations nightmare of an industrial accident, machinery collapse or brutal injury to some young apprentice.\n\n"Each death for us is another tool for Bhushan to continue his anti-technological fury and continue to keep technology out of the south," Benjen IV had told him matter-of-factly when he originally appointed Davirtannen to his position as overseer of Ostkranbi industrial affairs, "One accident could cause a chain reaction that would tear the whole south apart in fury - a fury you know whould be directed against us, and only us."\n\nThere was truth to that, Davirtannen knew. Although he could still not comprehend some of the sheer absuridty of the tactics of the jackals in the Chitali government, Benjen IV had taught him much about the court, lessons that would translate to his rise to more and more powerful positions during the reigns of the next two Yarils. Davirtannen could not shake off the feeling, as he walked, however, that he had made the wrong choices. That Jakob or Hira or even Hoversholm, his old ally, would someday devour him, and crush the old breaucrat under the spirit of a new age of reform.\n\nIf there was anything he could do, it was to move on with his projects, make them as efficient as possible, innovate into electronics, industry, RADAR - to make himself so vital to the spirit of Benjen IV's modernizations that he would be more than a politician or an opportunistic reformer. Then, Davirtannen would triumph, and guide the Yaril through an age of wisdom and reason."

No doubt some on the left wished they were right, but Davirtannen was no radical Marksist.\n\n"Benjen," Sanjay Gadra smiled, glancing down at a paper stamped by the Yaril himself, "You are hereby relieved of your duties as chief executive officer of the Royal Manufacturing and Electronics Corporation and chief advisor to the Yaril on the matters of welfare and industry.

Everyone had awaited this briefing, it would tell them what the hell was going on in their nation, and the council must have some answers. But what emerged was not the council as a whole; it was just Ivar himself, dressed in his signature loose suit and glasses, looking somber as none had seen him before.\n\nStepping to a podium before the assembled reporters, he began to speak, "My dear countrydeer. A great tragedy has befallen this nation. During the Royal Progress two days ago, our Yaril Benjen was kidnapped and killed by far-right, reactionary generals, including General Huddarnen. Since then, national soldiers have had the city on lockdown to search for clues, and I apologize for waiting this long to inform you all. We needed all the evidence first. And from that search, we can also place incriminating evidence on another figure, Jakob the Grey for participating in the plot." At this, the crowd gasped, while before they had been silent in shock now, they were outraged. The ancient advisor betraying the Yaril?! Many were confused, but many more seethed with anger. Ivar continued, "Due to the collaboration of the nobles in this plot, it has been decided we will be postponing the coronation of a successor until further notice, and I will be assuming the title of Kansleri of Chital. I would like to ask you to postpone asking any further questions, for I must take my time to grieve. Benjen was a close friend of mine, and I must now make my peace as well."\n\nIvar exited the stage as the crowd erupted in shock and rage at what he had told them, republican chants began to rise amongst them as reporters rushed to get the story to the presses and broadcast it all over Chital.\n\nWalking back into the council chambers, Ivar Hoversholm sighed and said to himself, "Sorry old friend.

The door beside him opened, and his wife emerged. At least now, they were able to be married—the stress of rulership off his shoulders.\n\n"Do you need some more dear?" she asked. He replied with a soft voice, "No, my rose, I still have enough. I haven't been able to drink much with all that is going on." "Would you like to talk about it?" she responded. The deer laughed, "You know I've already said plenty. But it's all the same, I guess. I just feel uncertain. This nation was supposed to be under my care. But here it is, under his." The doe frowned, "But you trust him, do you not? Try to think about the best in things!"\n\nBenjen smiled. "You always know how to make me feel better Ruusu."\n\n"I just hope he knows what he is doing.""

As the war for the subcontinent came to a close, neither traditionalist Yarildoms or princely federations emerged as the dominant force in the Northeast of Zebrica.

Benjen V now stands as Benjen I, Sea-King of all Hindians, but his throne is powerless. Instead, power in Chital and now Hindia lies in Jakob the Grey, the Yaril's premier advisor. A staunch traditionalist and an old war hero, Benjen's uncle has established himself as the most powerful deer in a new viking Hindia guided not by bureaucrats or power-hungry warlords, but by military deer devoted to the values of the past.

A member of the anti-government Axis of Chital before his ascendancy to power, many have certain reservations about Bhushan's ties to spymistress Hira Ramachan. Comparisons to the Storm King or allegations of puppetry aside, none can deny that the imposing Bhushan Gurat has built a powerful and populist Hindia on the backs of his adoring followers, and will surely be a force to be reckoned with."

 ### TRAITS AND DESCS ###
 
 CTL_BENJEN_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 6th of June, 975 in Ostkranbi\n\n§YBiography§!: They say that uneasy lies the head that wears the crown, and that cannot be more true for Benjen V Kudlinen, Yaril of Chital and staunch reformist, beset on all sides by scheming nobles, traitorous former allies, and heartless revolutionaries.\n\nBenjen V was never a warrior like the old Sea-Kings of the continent, raiders who ravaged the Eastern seaboard of Zebrica and subjugated the native deer under their rule from Sambar to Doehli. Born in Ostkranbi, the capital of Chital, to Benjen IV Kudlinen, Benjen would be trained in stewardship from a young age. An intelligent and soft-spoken young deer, he was quick to make friends with numerous noble children and even the older deer at court, and was consistently applauded by his father, even if he was not exactly the most diligent of deer. Even when his father died in 998, and his brother, Aatto, became Yaril of Chital, Benjen remained gregarious and ready to take up the mantle of chief advisor to his brother.\n\nThe Yaril's life, however, would soon come crashing down. Aatto died in 1001 pacifying native rebels, and Benjen was forced to carry on the torch of the Kudlinen Dynasty. His chief advisors annuled his engagement to his fiancé, a commondeer, and Benjen was left ruling over a Yarildom that condemned him as a fat steward and doe-ish coward - "The Kind Viking". Slowly replacing Aatto's advisors with his own old friends, Benjen's reign culminated in the establishment of the Council of Seven in 1003 - meant to serve as a united advisory council of both Hindian and Olenian nobles, all originally loyal to the Yaril. Unfortunately, his opposition on the council began to resent him, and three of his greatest adversaries on it formed the Axis of Chital, to curtail what they believed to be his blatant abuses of power and failure to bring reform to Chital.\n\nWith the Council becoming more and more hostile, it seems Benjen will need to act fast if he wants to ensure the survival of Chital - and his dynasty.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: MonAx"
 
 CTL_IVAR_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 29th of July, 966 in Hamaholm\n\n§YBiography§!: Five years ago, Ivar Hoversholm was the most powerful deer in the Chitali government, one of the Yaril's closest friends and most competent advisors. Now, however, he is a shell of his former self, disgraced among the nobility, and consumed with a cold, silent hatred for all of the traitors that now rule his nation.\n\nBorn in Hamaholm in the Thanedom of Valdeland to a caring noble family, Ivar Hoversholm was considered a gifted child, and received much praise and respect from his teachers and the Valdeland court, a great insult to his twin sister, Katarina, who would inevitably play a part in his downfall. A rising star in Chitali politics, Ivar and his father, Elik, became voices of reformism, populism, and the rule of law on then Yaril Benjen IV's council. When Elik resigned his courtly duties out of old age in 1000, Ivar became even more influential in the coastal nation's court. Close friendships with industrialist Benjen Davirtannen and then heir to throne Benjen Kudlinen made Ivar a prime candidate for a spot on the Yaril's advisory council, which would eventually become the Council of Seven in 1003.\n\nHowever, with the establishment of the Council of Seven, came Ivar's undoing. A founding member of the Axis of Chital, Hoversholm saw the Yaril supporting what in his eyes were elitist and purge-happy philosophies espoused by the court's so-called reformists, but Benjen, to Ivar's shame, would not listen. With his influence supplanted by a new brand of reformist, the Axis drifting further and further from the reformism Ivar still staunchly supported, and his friendship with the Yaril waning, Ivar began to attend the Council less and less, and continued to spend his time in Hamaholm, dreaming up elaborate ways where he could restore his power, and take vengeance on those who had disgraced him.\n\nNow, it seems, his dreams have finally come true.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: bunnyshrubby"

 CTL_JAKUB_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 8th of July, 943 in Kanelimpra\n\n§YBiography§!: Jakob "the Grey" Kudlinen - younger brother of Benjen IV, gracious and loyal uncle of Benjen V and his brother Aatto, and now, the most powerful deer in Chital.\n\nBorn two years after the heir to the throne, Benjen IV Kudlinen, Jakob the Grey has always been second-in-consideration - for Yaril of Chital, for chief of Chital's great Viking navy and army, and then, for Chief Minister with the establishment of Council of Seven. While his brother sought to bring fire and blood into the lands of the natives and the glories of the industrial revolution into the lands of Chital, Jakob was right beside him, with an exemplary education in Macawia's top naval academies. A fierce raider before the practice was eventually discouraged by the internationalist Benjen IV, Jakob soon became a war hero to the people of Chital as he fought the influence of Macawian pirates and upstart Hindian revolutionaries through the reign of three Yarils.\n\nNow, however, life for Jakob is much different. A military deer at heart, he has found himself in the upper echelons of government, whispering into the ear of Benjen V and promoting a return to the traditions that made Chital great at every turn. A loyalist to Benjen IV, Jakob has never kept his clear resistance to the Yaril's reformist views silent, and with the aid of extremist military elements, his new base of power, he has become the most prominent right-wing royalist in all of Chital.\n\nIf he can balance his far-right general staff and the hostility of an increasingly rebellious Yaril toward the traditionalists, Jakob will not only be enshrined in Chital's futures as a war hero, but as the greatest statesdeer to grace the nation.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Memerskai"

 CTL_HIRA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 22nd of November, 976 in Haarihus\n\n§YBiography§!: Too many in Chital are born with blue blood and the blessing of Ukko, with not a connection in their life to the plight of those at the bottom.\n\nThe same cannot be said for Hira Ramachan. Plucked from obscurity and relative poverty, Hira first rose to prominence in the south following the appointment of her father, Jheri, as Mayor of Haarihus during Aatto's great pacification of the southern lords. From then, she was sent to Ostkranbi to plead for further priveleges for the destitute natives and former thralls of her father's lowly seat, in the process catching the eye of then Kronprins Benjen Kudlinen. When Aatto died, Benjen V then found a sure ally in the young noble, who remained out of the ancient traditionalist clique of rulers Aatto surrounded himself with.\n\nHira, however, soon became much more than just a puppet spymistress. Her missions to root out traitors in the South saw her make covert allies in resistance movements while on the other hoof declaring to Benjen that they were all "sorted out", and her missions to discover secrets among the court led her to uncover a disturbing amount of information on each and every of Benjen V's Council of Seven - Benjen, of course, received barely any of it.\n\nNow, Hira continues scheming as the leader of the Axis of Chital, and with a united alliance of Southern upstarts, disgraced nobles, charmed bureaucrats, and true populists, the young spymistress has now fully consolidated her hold over the nation.\n\nWhether she shall forge a society of equity and tolerance or simply reverse the roles of power is unknown, but the choices are all hers to make.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Memerskai" 

 CTL_BHUSHAN_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 2nd of June, 971 in Mahorna\n\n§YBiography§!: Normally, an aristocrat who promotes open disobidience to an established rule of law is purged, killed, or otherwise removed from office within days. Bhushan Gurat, through either a reputation of icompetence, status as a useful extremist, or a reputation as such a barbaric force of will that many are too scared to even challenge him, has remained an open opponent of House Kudlinen for a decade since the young native first inherited the seat of Mahorna.\n\nA firebrand religious populist, Bhushan the Brash, as he is called, is one of the most extreme politicans in Chital, but yet commands a sizable and extremely devoted movement - the Tuya, "Faithful" in the native Chitali language. A militarist religious order of Mahimata, the mother goddess of the Hindians, the Tuya have fought against the Olenian pantheon ever since Bhushan first took command of a once-weak organization of squabbling theologians which bore that name.\n\nPerhaps the most powerful Southern noble in Chital, Gurat was appointed to the Council of Seven as a voice to appease his subjects in Mahorna, part of the vast native Hindian population, who he soon became a key voice of. Brash and bumbling, many view Bhushan as nothing more than a charlatan playing with fire and dreams greater than his own, but little, if any, doubt his convictions - his fanatic Chitali patriotism, his love for his people - and his desire to make the heavenly mother come to Ostkranbi, whatever the cost in blood may be.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Memerskai" 

 GENERAL_SANJAY_DESC:0 "§YBiography§!: Sanjay Gadra, a distant heir to the fortunes of House Gadra, an Oleno-Hindian upon the outskirts of Gondeerana, is a loyalist to Jakob the Grey and Ieffri Huddarnen, who he is seldom seen without. Together, the two have formed a bloc in the army promoting the continued usage of trench tactics and an aggressive foreign policy in response to the Hindian threat.\n\nSanjay has risen to a relatively high position in the army, one surprisngly high for his military expertise, solely because of his connections with his industrialist and arms manufacturer family in House Gadra. With experience in the air force as well as in the armed forces, Sanjay Gadra echoes his family's ties to the grand pursuit of flight and their continued lip service to the army and the traditionalist forces of Jakob the Grey.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Riley Vinchers"

 GENERAL_LIEM_DESC:0 "§YBiography§!: Allies of Liem Wesfelt, born in the eastern fields of Kanelimpra, would describe him as a visionary general and a powerful and promising member of the young officer corps of Chital. His enemies, however, would paint a much different picture, focusing largely upon his great abuses of power in service to Jakob the Grey and sheer brutality of his anti-resistance methods.\n\nBeloved among the Oleno-Hindians, the young officer has already completed numerous tours of duty against the natives in the South, ones that have seen violence and bloodshed on the scale of the efforts of the Iron Regent in Sambar. However, many whisper that Wesfelt's ascendancy to power will soon collapse - if Benjen V and the reformists have their way.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Riley Vinchers"

 GENERAL_LUDEN_DESC:0 "§YBiography§!: Originally from Katiava, Rudolf ventured inland on the scent of spice, securing a small parcel of land in the wilds near the forests of Merkaanan, with the intent to build up a plantation of his own. Past the initial excitement, life was warm, life was pleasant, and life was boring. That was until before long, a CPLF incursion swept through the locality.\n\nWith little else to do, and little trust in the local nobles, Rudolf decided he might as well try his own hoof at dealing with the issue, and roamed the area in search of the raiders. He followed their movements, harassing and sabotaging them in the field and by their encampments, whatever seemed opportune. Rudolf was always careful to disappear away into the brush whenever things got too troublesome, until finally the group disbanded.\n\nOnce he realized he actually had a knack for this kind of work, Rudolf began to informally organize joint ventures with others who had also been wronged by bandits or resistance groups, growing bolder and traveling further by the operation. Eventually, his antics got to be enough that a local noble presented him with an ultimatum: To either put his skills to use with a generously given commission into the Chitali military, or be hunted down himself as an outlaw subverting Chitali authority.\n\nThe choice, though quite sudden, was simple enough, and with enough time, Rudolf turned his lowly commission into a respectable rank.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Truffle Shine"

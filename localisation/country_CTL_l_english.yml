 ### FOCUS ###

 CTL_the_1_year_plan:0 "...One Must Remain"
 CTL_the_1_year_plan_desc:0 "The Chitali season of the early dew has begun, and with it, the Yaril must give an address opening the season, promising boons for the great farmers and aristans of Chital and a restoration of the fractured nation's unity and pride. With the current political situation, however, his words might matter more than ever before."

 CTL_call_up_the_nobles:0 "A Meeting With the Three"
 CTL_call_up_the_nobles_desc:0 "Benjen has a year to fix the problems facing Chital by the next Munpani season - clearly he cannot let the Axis of Chital levy their influence over the Council of Seven at any point in that time. To rectify the issue of Axis influence in the Council, Benjen shall call a meeting for only three of his most trusted advisors, so that he shall only listen to sound policy and rhetoric."

 CTL_deal_with_dannya_shah:0 "Dealing With Dannya Shah"
 CTL_deal_with_dannya_shah_desc:0 "Under the leadership of revolutionary firebrand Dannya Shah, the Chitali People's Liberation Front and its communist allies have continued to grow in power. If we are to quash the growing support for this new ideology of chaos and destruction, we must first send a message to those who would be foolish enough to support them - starting with ending the revolutionary agitation of Dannya Shah."

 CTL_seer_issue:0 "A Summit With the Godi"
 CTL_seer_issue_desc:0 "Traditional Olenian godi still hold positions of high importance at the court of the Yaril, but their presence has been a subject of debate for a long time now. Their influence is upsetting to our native subjects, and their close ties to Jakob the Grey's traditionalist faction worries many of the minor nobility, who fear their power will be threatened. It is finally time to decide once and for all the role of these holy deer."

 CTL_sikh_issue:0 "Dealing With the Tuymaiyānatu"
 CTL_sikh_issue_desc:0 "For hundreds of years, a native religious sect known as the "Tuya" has existed on the political fringe of Chital. In these trying times, the Tuya's charitable actions, as well as its militant defiance of our regime, has attracted new members. Most dangerously, Bhushan the Brash himself, is an adherent. We must address what to do about this movement and fast." 

 CTL_the_fate_of_the_council:0 "Dealing With the Council"
 CTL_the_fate_of_the_council_desc:0 "The Council of Seven was created to calm the concerns of the native nobility, but its successes have been mixed. While it has improved native conditions over the years of its existence, many have come to realize it exists just to support the Yaril's power, causing them to lose their faith in its authority. And now, with factionalism taking hold, Benjen needs to make tough choices regarding its future."
 
 CTL_choosing_an_advisor:0 "Favoring A Faction"
 CTL_choosing_an_advisor_desc:0 "The three factions of the Council each hold significant power throughout Chital. The Yaril possesses his own ambitions of reform and reconstruction, but he may yet be swayed by one of the powerful nobles that sit on the council. The future of Chital shall be decided in these negotiation halls and secretive conversations."

 CTL_on_the_berserkers:0 "A Yaril's Reputation"
 CTL_on_the_berserkers_desc:0 "Our Yaril is known as a kind and timid figure throughout all of Chital and beyond. While this personality meshes well with the reform movements, advisors like Jakob the Grey are less than happy about his dissimilarity to his father Benjen IV. Perhaps it is time for the Yaril to try and change?"

 CTL_adding_more_yesdeer:0 "A New Face"
 CTL_adding_more_yesdeer_desc:0 "Currently Benjen lacks a comfortable power base where it matters in Chitali politics, and appointing a new advisor to court the favor of one of the many factions in Chital would sure up his support in crucial ways. Now the only question, is who."

CTL_council_call_up:0 "Seven Shall Enter..."
CTL_council_call_up_desc:0 "Seven deer of all stripes make up the Council of Seven, forged in the chaos of the Hindian anarchy of the early 1000s, including Benjen himself. If Chital is to be reformed substantially before the end of the year, we must win the war of influence within this body, and secure the loyalty of its kingmakers... or if all goes south, kingbreakers."

 CTL_the_council_of_9:0 "A Council for Nine"
 CTL_the_council_of_9_desc:0 "These times increasingly seem like critical ones in Chital's history, and all factions wish to make a move. With pressure from the entirety of the council, the Yaril will be adding one more seat to the governmental body. Whichever faction fills it, will become far more powerful."

 CTL_the_supply_issue:0 "Supplies Against Socialism"
 CTL_the_supply_issue_desc:0 "The southern lands where communists and rebellious nobles roam have always been hard for the Chitali Yarils to control. And now, when the rebels have access to explosives and canons, our logistics have been thrown into disarray. We must establish a continuous supply line to the southern territories so that we can put down this rebellion."

 CTL_pacify_the_south:0 "Ending the CPLF"
 CTL_pacify_the_south_desc:0 "Loyal military units have tracked down the CPLF's final holdout in the southern hills, and we are ready to finally put an end to this. The Yaril, in accordance with tradition, shall lead his forces personally to battle against the rebels. Chital shall be free of them once and for all!"

 CTL_infiltrate_her_entourage:0 "Infiltrate Her Entourage"
 CTL_infiltrate_her_entourage_desc:0 "Many within the CPLF are not true communists, or even truly dedicated to the overthrow of the Yaril, they are discontent and impoverished deer who may yet be brought back to reason with a little convincing. Royal operatives will be dispatched to infiltrate the CPLF and encourage disunity amongst its ranks, how we go about this though may differ..."

 CTL_the_fate_of_the_ringleaders:0 "An Axis Connection"
 CTL_the_fate_of_the_ringleaders_desc:0 "Dannya Shah always seems to be one step ahead of us, and always has a few more guns then we could have accounted for, these discrepancies in planning and logistics have begun to raise eyebrows at the royal court. A letter found in a spice field, bearing Dannya's seal may give us some answers, though we may find ourselves dealing with something larger than the CPLF."

 CTL_taking_back_the_spice:0 "Reclaim the Spices"
 CTL_taking_back_the_spice_desc:0 "The Spice plantations of inland Chital have always been a source of revenue for whoever controls them. In present, they lie in the hooves of the southern rebels who use them to secure funds and arms for their efforts. Reclaiming these plantations would secure our regime much-needed funds for the continued conflict."

 CTL_royal_progress:0 "The Royal Progress"
 CTL_royal_progress_desc:0 "It is time for the Yaril to take a trip throughout the south. He will meet with supporters and dissidents alike to try and firm up his rule.\n\nLet's hope he knows what he is doing."

###INDUSTRIALIST PATH####
CTL_reopen_the_benjen_iv_industrial_bureau:0 "Reopen the Benjen IV Industrial Bureau"
CTL_reopen_the_benjen_iv_industrial_bureau_desc:0 "Recent developments in Chital have alerted us to the disturbing fact that the reforms of Benjen IV, the father of Yarils Aatto and Benjen V, still need massive overhauls to complete their intended goals. Leftovers from the lackluster abolishment of thralldom and incomplete urbanization must be addressed."

CTL_expand_the_bureau_to_science:0 "Establish a Scientific Branch"
CTL_expand_the_bureau_to_science_desc:0 "The Industrial Bureau's efforts to modernize our nation can not only be limitied to factories and labor reform, our nation is also far beyond the rest of the world in terms of science. And it is time for us to catch up. Opening a scientific wing will be the first step on this path."

CTL_bridging_the_education_gap:0 "Bridging The Education Gap"
CTL_bridging_the_education_gap_desc:0 "While our Northern cities have begun to develop an educated middle class, the same can not be said for the south. It is time to bring our new institutions to the southern provinces in order to ensure they keep pace with the rest of the nation's developments."

CTL_quest_for_skilled_workers:0 "The Quest For Skilled Workers"
CTL_quest_for_skilled_workers_desc:0 "Our population is not skilled in the use of industrial machines. We can have as many factories and drills as we want, but if we can't use them they are without purpose. Opening new trade schools shall educate the population on our new industrial opportunities and how to take advantage of them."

CTL_libraries_of_chital:0 "Libraries Across Chital"
CTL_libraries_of_chital_desc:0 "Establishing a network of free public libraries full of both educational and enjoyable texts will hopefully encourage literacy and education amongst our subjects. Soon Chital shall be known as a nation that looks forward into the future, not backwards to the past."

CTL_agrarianism_through_the_storm:0 "Kahnli's Southern Roots"
CTL_agrarianism_through_the_storm_desc:0 "Our economy should remain rooted in the plantations and agriculture of our south, so says Southern noble and socialite Wasil Kahnli. We produce many useful products like tea, rubber, and spices there, and exporting these goods will surely bring us prosperity."

CTL_get_them_to_work:0 "Baronnen's Northern Innovation"
CTL_get_them_to_work_desc:0 "Our northern factories need further support in order to grow, further subsidies will increase industrial output and lift many of the urban poor out of poverty, so says Northern noble and administrator Elik Baronnen."

CTL_northern_industrial_primacy:0 "The Northern Approach"
CTL_northern_industrial_primacy_desc:0 "Elik Baronnen, a prominent Northern industrialist and sympathizer of the reformist cause, has offered his support for our government's efforts to reach full employment in the North of Chital. Although his pro-Axis paternalism may prove cumbersome to deal with, there is no doubt that his aid will prove vital to improving our industrial base."

CTL_southern_industrial_primacy:0 "The Southern Strategy"
CTL_southern_industrial_primacy_desc:0 "Wasil Kahnli, a flamboyant socialite and aristocrat, and a prominent supporter of the Axis and Eva Pillai, has offered his support for our government's efforts to reach full employment in the South of Chital. Although we cannot be truly sure of his intentions, there is no doubt that his aid will prove vital to improving our industrial base."

CTL_focus_on_resources:0 "The Rush Of Excavation"
CTL_focus_on_resources_desc:0 "Chital is rich in natural resources like minerals and rubber, currently unexploited due to our recent civil strife and instability. The possible economic boons from these resources is immense, and we should focus on the construction of the necessary infrastructure to make use of them."

CTL_allure_of_manufacturing:0 "The Allure Of Manufacturing"
CTL_allure_of_manufacturing_desc:0 "The modern economy is the manufacturing economy, the course of history has inevitably shown that the economics of the future involves increased specialization and mechanization. One day we will no longer need to employ a massive amount of our population in agriculture and mining, and our economic policy needs to prepare for this day."

CTL_longships_into_traders:0 "Longships Into Traders"
CTL_longships_into_traders_desc:0 "Regardless of our goverment position on them, the Vikingar always have their... less savory elements. The effect of raiding on our international diplomacy is something we would love to avoid. Thus, we should remind the Vikingar of their cultural roots as traders, not just looters, and they may yet be of use to us."

CTL_minimum_wage:0 "Begin Industrial Regulations"
CTL_minimum_wage_desc:0 "Uninhibited industrialization is a double-edged sword. It can bring great wealth to the factory owners, and the government through taxes, but it leaves open the possibility that the people may suffer. Thus, we must act as a shield between the desires and profits of industry and the livelihoods of our citizens."

CTL_freedom_in_markets:0 "Keep Our Hooves Out Of It"
CTL_freedom_in_markets_desc:0 "Industrial regulations have only ever lead to increased strain on the government and business through bureaucracy and red tape, trying to have the administration watch over everything and enforce every code balloons costs that transfer down to the citizenry. Letting the market take its course is the inevitable best solution in the long run."

CTL_invest_in_industry:0 "Invest In Industry"
CTL_invest_in_industry_desc:0 "While in Hindia, Chital is one of the more developed states, we still have a long way to go to catch up to other modern nations. Government investment in industry will help this process along."

CTL_sweet_sweet_rubber:0 "Sweet, Sweet Rubber!"
CTL_sweet_sweet_rubber_desc:0 "We are one of the most rubber rich nations in the world, and as modern society invents more and more uses for the substance, the opportunity to invest and develop the economy is one we can not miss out on."

CTL_arms_for_the_struggle:0 "Begin Industrial Militarization"
CTL_arms_for_the_struggle_desc:0 "One day, war will come to Hindia, it is inevitable when we are surrounded by hostile regimes, so the only thing we can do is prepare. Investment in arms manufacturing and inviting a few companies from abroad will hopefully be the kick our military production needs."

CTL_chitali_deer_in_chitali_factories:0 "Chitali Deer In Chitali Factories"
CTL_chitali_deer_in_chitali_factories_desc:0 "Unifying the industrial strength of our cities with the resources of the countryside Chital is in an amazing position to become a strong industrial power. With time, and effort, we can rival the powers of griffonia and equus, and even become a superpower in the modern age."

CTL_self_sufficiency_always:0 "The Path To Self-Sufficiency"
CTL_self_sufficiency_always_desc:0 "Becoming reliant on foreign nations is a one way path towards destruction. Chital, as well as Hindia, must learn to stand on its own four hooves and look outwards with an independent mindset."

CTL_restart_the_eastern_trade_routes:0 "Restart the Eastern Trade Routes"
CTL_restart_the_eastern_trade_routes_desc:0 "The ancestors of the Olenians came from the East, sailing from their homeland in Olenia. By looking back this direction we find the wealthy and industrialized Equestria, open to our longships. This time however, there won't be any sacking."

CTL_aid_from_the_macawians:0 "Chital's Own Pact Of 907"
CTL_aid_from_the_macawians_desc:0 "Macawia is a industrialized and developed nation right to our west who has taken on the role of protector of the oceans of North-Eastern Zebrica. Ever since their occupation of Hirvimaa, their navy has patrolled our waters with vigor, hunting down the last vikingar. However, partnering with them would be a great boon in the long run."

CTL_legalize_labour_organizations:0 "Legalize Labour Unions"
CTL_legalize_labour_organizations_desc:0 "Unions are a relatively new arival to Chital, as our industrialization has been limited at best. But as the factories open, so do the minds of our workers, and unionization becomes more and more appealing. In our efforts to oppose the estates of the nobility and established wealthy classes within Chital, we shall grant favorable terms to these new unions and allow them to operate freely."

CTL_protect_employers:0 "Employers First"
CTL_protect_employers_desc:0 "Unions are a relatively new arival to Chital, as our industrialization has been limited at best. But as the factories open, so to do the parlors of the union bosses. Unions are a threat to the traditional economic structure that has created capital accross the world for generations, but they allow workers a defense against abuse. So we shall tolerate them and grant some rights, but we must always think with our wallet."

CTL_let_them_know_their_place:0 "Crush The Movement"
CTL_let_them_know_their_place_desc:0 "Unions are a relatively new arival to Chital, as our industrialization has been limited at best. But as the factories open, so to does the mouth of the red serpent, ready to swallow our naive populace. The only result of unions is the spread of socialism, and socialism is the greatest threat to our nation as a whole. We must destroy these subversive groups posthaste lest the fangs sink deeper."

CTL_close_the_bureau:0 "Close The Benjen IV Industrial Bureau"
CTL_close_the_bureau_desc:0 "The Bureau has served its purpose, and the time has come to close this chapter of Chitali history. Our industrial progress is far beyond what it once was, and we must now give thanks that we have entered the modern era. Whether we pray to the Olenian Gods or to Mahimata, bread shall be broken this night, as Chital enters the annals of modern history."

###HIRA RAMACHAN PATH###
 CTL_ramachan_takes_control:0 "The Schemes Of Madame Hira"
 CTL_ramachan_takes_control_desc:0 "The unassuming leader of the Axis of Chital, Madame Hira Ramachan, has taken control of the Yarildom following the disbanding of the Council of Seven. With her goals of a broad populist agenda and a centralization of political power for the natives and her allies, Hira will surely not allow the traitors who have driven Chital into the ground to go unpunished."

 CTL_puppet_jarl:0 "A Puppet Yaril"
 CTL_puppet_jarl_desc:0 "Brienna Kudlinen, the Yaril's cousin and younger sister of Jakob the Grey, has never been active in Chitali politics, and after Jakob and Benjen's removal from the political scene, is technically the heir to the Yarildom. To truly stabilize our government, we must bring a Yaril back to Chital, and Brienna is just the right doe for the job."

 CTL_a_few_loose_ends:0 "A Few Loose Ends"
 CTL_a_few_loose_ends_desc:0 "There are some members of the Chitali nobility that are beyond redemption. Supporters of a traditional Olenian aristocracy have continued to oppose our government, and if they ever took control of Chital again, would surely enslave the Hindians once more. If we wish to ensure the stability of the Ramachan government, these traditionalists must be purged."

 CTL_exile_the_heir:0 "Exile The Grey Viking"
 CTL_exile_the_heir_desc:0 "A vicious enforcer of the whims of the Yaril and his predecessors, Jakob the Grey has left a trail of Hindian blood in his wake. While we surely admire his military prowess, there is no need for him to remain in government any longer, as he has shown himself to only be loyal to the Yaril and his own authority. He must be exiled, as he has most certainly overstayed his welcome."

 CTL_send_out_their_secrets:0 "Selling Secrets"
 CTL_send_out_their_secrets_desc:0 "As the court's de-facto Spymistress for years, Hira Ramachan has developed a certain wealth of information pertaining to the hidden desires and controversial political motives of her previous higher-ups. With the people still skeptical of Madame Hira's newfound position of power, perhaps it is the perfect time to reveal the pleasures, deadly intrigue, and corruption of the Chitali nobility."

 CTL_factionalize_the_crown_loyalists:0 "Operatives in the Resistance"
 CTL_factionalize_the_crown_loyalists_desc:0 "The resistance to the Axis of Chital is prone to ideological squabbling of their own, especially the traditonalists and the reformists, who, even with completely different philosophies, have united against Madame Hira and the Axis. Our efforts must be furthered to factionalize the resistance, so that it pains Jakob the Grey and Benjen Davirtannen to even look at eachother."

 CTL_bhushan_as_deputy:0 "Appoint Bhushan As Deputy"
 CTL_bhushan_as_deputy_desc:0 "Bhushan Gurat has served as Ramachan's greatest ally in the government and in the Axis for years. Herra Ivar may be a dignified figurehead for some deer, but Bhushan is the epitome of the spirit of the people of Chital. A protector of the native culture and way of life and staunch agrarian populist, Bhushan is what Chital needs as its deputy, not more prancing nobles with minds only for themselves."

 CTL_native_resistance_desc:0 "With support for radical movements exacerbated by the modern movements for harmony, natural rights, and independence throughout the world, the native Chitalis have grown discontent with the current government of Benjen V and the Council of Seven. Many of the natives have begun a policy of complete opposition to the Oleno-Hindian native landed elite, who they believe do not truly represent the people of Chital. If the goverment does not deal with these newfound native tensions quickly, then it could have a crisis on its hooves. With growing support for the Hindian nobility faction in the Council of Seven, the Axis of Chital, along with an increase in militant leftist and republican activity, often sponsored by these same nobles, it is imperative that our government restore balance to Chital, before the Yarildom is swept away by internal turmoil."

Committed to anti-government politics and a desire to change Chital for the better, the Axis supports strengthening Hindian positions and fixing the disparity in power between the landed Oleno-Hindian elite and the commondeer. Given seats on the Council of Seven during the first years of Benjen's reign, the Axis has continued to be a thorn in the monarchy's side, even supporting republican movements at points to sabotage the rule of House Kudlinen.

 ###ADVISORS###
 CTL_seer_advisor:0 "Dreia of Lavborg"
 CTL_seer_advisor_desc:0 "Dreia of Lavborg, often called the Laughing Priest for his bucking of many ritualistic trends in favor of an accomodating view of the Pantheon and the recruitment of new worshippers, has served as the de-facto second in command of the followers of Ukko in Chital for years. Although they have sparred on theological matters numerous times before, Dreia remains a loyal disciple of Konnar, the leader of the Pantheon's worshippers in Chital, and along with the native Caarlit Lawas, has helped bolster the outreach of the Olenian Gods throughout skeptic urban communities and zealous native ones."
 CTL_noble_advisor1:0 "Andreas Savannen"
 CTL_noble_advisor1_desc:0 "Andreas Savannen has served as a personal aide and advisor to chairdeer of the RMEC Benjen Davirtannen for as long as many Chitali can remember. Considered to be just as intelligent if not more so than his mentor, Savannen has paradoxically made a name for himself as a particularly skilled faceless bureaucrat with little prominent political and social leanings. Unlike Davirtannen, he has kept out of courtly politics, but personally, he holds significant sympathy for the causes of the disgraced Ivar Hoversholm and his mentor both, along with disdain for the scheming nobility of the Ostkranbi."
 CTL_noble_advisor2:0 "Tuomas the Quiet"
 CTL_noble_advisor2_desc:0 "Known for an almost-ritualistic silent nature, Tuomas the Quiet came to court with his good friend and fellow Fraskali noble, Elik Baronnen, but has now become a mind completely of his own. A ruthless enforcer with a habit for cruel and unusual punishment, Tuomas' strength does not lie in his haggard, shadowy appearance, which inspires fear into little, but instead his eerie demeanour and utter disregard for the international codes of harmony."
 CTL_noble_advisor3:0 "Caarlit Samara"
 CTL_noble_advisor3_desc:0 "A bumbling steward and personal confidante of Eva Pillai, Caarlit Samara lies out of place in the Chitali capital. His Oleno-Hindian demeanour, straight from Gondeerana, still carries a lingering effect on his personality that his largely dissipated from Eva's, and as a result, he knows little allies but his old comrade. A competent ally, Samara has served as Eva's eyes and ears in areas the powerful advisor is unlikely to tread."
 CTL_business_advisor1:0 "Ajit Rashigas"
 CTL_business_advisor1_desc:0 "Ajit Rashigas, a business and entrepreneurial mind from the West of Chital, serves as the civilian portion of the Rashigas twins' operations in Chital. Ajit, weaker but more intelligent than his brother, has expressed sympathy and solidarity for Benjen V, Ivar Hoversholm, and Jakob the Grey, with disdain for the methods of the Axis and the percieved "elitism" of Eva Pillai and Davirtannen. A populist sympathizer, Rashigas remains a political wild-card, but would surely find himself at home in most any non-Axis administration."
 CTL_business_advisor2:0 "Gurunath Rashigas"
 CTL_business_advisor2_desc:0 "Gurunath Rashigas, a business and military mind from the West of Chital, serves as the military portion of the Rashigas twins' operations in Chital. Gurunath, stouter and stronger than his brother, is an ally of Ivar Hoversholm within the court, but surprisingly, he has also been seen as a key potential ally of Jakob the Grey. Rashigas, having served as an aide to Hoversholm but collaborator to Jakob in military operations, is a political wild-card, but like his brother, remains independent."
 CTL_military_advisor1:0 "Jashiv Frawar"
 CTL_military_advisor1_desc:0 "Jashiv Frawar is yet another native ally of Jakob the Grey, a position many would believe to be an oxymoron. Frawar, a young "New Noble", has been appointed to numerous bureaucratic and military posts throughout his time in Ostkranbi as part of Benjen V's relentless reshuffling and reform efforts. Paranoid, and known for controversial statements in support of the far-right, Frawar would be an easy ally for Jakob the Grey among Benjen's inner circle, as part of a youth and native faction unlikely to normally support traditionalist politics."
 CTL_military_advisor2:0 "Grasya Kahnli"
 CTL_military_advisor2_desc:0 "Grasya Kahnli, the young commoner wife of industrialist and socialite Wasil Kahnli, has risen from a young, relatively modest courtier in Kahnli's own domain to become one of the most powerful does in Ostkranbi. An ally to Hira Ramachan, Eva Pillai, and her own husband, Grasya is known for her appetite for courtly intrigue and lavish parties and gatherings, which although gratifying to the former commoner, mostly serve as a honeypot for various nobles to spill their secrets to an Axis spy... or for said Axis spies to connect."

 CTL_da_chonker_desc:0 "The only thing more apparent than Elik Baronnen's bitter rivalry with fellow noble and industrialist Wasil Kahnli is his own size, a testament to the deer's wealthy, opulent lifestyle and the sheer power the aging populist commands. A critic of the government whenever it suits him and a loyalist to Benjen whenever it doesn't, Baronnen is a clear supporter of the Axis of Chital's overall vision without clearly establishing himself in opposition to the old Yaril. Within the Axis, he is believed to align himself with Hoversholm and Ramachan's factions as a moderate conservative, and his distrust for Kahnli and Bhushan is well known."
 CTL_da_twink:0 "Wasil Kahnli"
 CTL_da_twink_desc:0 "The young and impulsive Wasil Kahnli, despite his rather obscure heritage and position in the minor nobility, has risen to a key advisory position within the royal court of Ostkranbi ever since he gained the patronage of Eva Pillai. Kahnli, known for his friendly demeanour and flamboyant status, has found a political home within Pillai's faction of Axis sympathizers and market reformers. An opponent to the Yaril's reforms and good friend to both Pillai and spymistress Hira, Kahnli holds little sympathy for fellow industrialist Elik Baronnen, once a key ally at court, or extremists of any sort within the Yarildom."
 CTL_hira_advisor:0 "Hira Ramachan"
 CTL_hira_advisor_desc:0 "Hira Ramachan, born a minor noble to the small Mayor of Haarihus, was plucked from relative obscurity to serve at the court of Benjen V as Chital's spymaster and premier intelligence authority. None can doubt her prowess and skill at finding secrets, even if sometimes they are ones the government would best have kept under wraps themselves... of course, if the government is similarly aligned with her pro-native, reformist interests, they will have nothing to fear."
 CTL_non_hira_advisor:0 "Anders Snier"
 CTL_non_hira_advisor_desc:0 "A bumbling bureaucrat, Anders Snier is not exactly one's first choice to take over the intelligence apparatus left by Hira Ramachan, but he is perhaps the only candidate willing and able, with much of Hira's once-strong connections across Chital no longer in the hands of the government. Hopefully, such a bumbling bureaucrat with a taste for starry-eyed reformism can truly bring something to Chital's growing intelligence network."

chital.1.t:0 "Opening The Munpani Season"
chital.1.d:0 "\"...Are you seriously going to deliver this drivel of an Evening Dew address to your cabinet about those fawnhood fantasies of yours? Have you learned nothing from our last heart-to-heart Benjen?\"\n\nThe elderly stag sighed and shook his head in disappointment at the Yaril, the weight of his wrinkles and battle scars only helping to accentuate his evident frown. It was only ironically fitting to have journeyed all the way to Ostkranbi from Gondeerana for the bi-monthly crown speech after having conducted a review of its garrison troops only to witness the Yaril, his very own nephew, once again gush about his ludicrous ideas of \"harmony of the masses\" and \"reform of the classes\" for Chital, he thought to himself.\n\n\"Drivel? Fawnhood fantasies!? Uncle Jakob, you must understand the gravity of the situation at hoof here,\" Benjen replied with a huff of annoyance, the dark bags under his eyes betraying his lack of sleep - and patience - from a white night of writing and rehearsal, \"the Yarildom is in a dire state of affairs, and it is clear that we can no longer present our backs to the Hindians and their needs. We must intervene and provide bread for the poor and a voice to the--\"\n\n\"And embolden those wannabe rebels in the inland with your bleeding-heart ideas?\" Jakob interrupted in his rough voice, \"Benjen, your father would have brought the axe to them to strike them down, and so would his father before him. That speech of yours will simply add logs to the fire if we are not to reaffirm our commitment to strength, tradition and national integrity.\"\n\nBenjen sighed, looking down at the paper he had spent all night painstakingly writing in his hoof. Jakob had always been rigid as a stone in his beliefs, and while the needs of his subjects could no longer be ignored, perhaps his uncle was right about Chital’s past speaking for itself. He then lifted his head and said..."

chital.2.d:0 "As Benjen entered the council chambers he felt the weight of responsibility on his shoulders, a familiar sensation if one that he had tried to avoid for most of his life. It had sat uneasy, unfamiliar, and more often than not unwelcome and today, today was no different. He had a task ahead of him which, despite his instincts, he had fixed his purpose on. Like a deer resigned to a fate they did not desire, he had set himself to his task.\n\nTaking his place at the head of the councillor’s table he greeted each of them in turn. Eva and Davirtannen smiled warmly accepting his welcome. Jakob nodded in encouragement, a hint of pride in his gaze. Hira returned his greeting with the watchful thoughtfulness she was known for. Ivar looked eager to rise and give a greeting of his own but the deer was smart enough to know that right belonged to Benjen. Bhushan accepted the greeting with a nod, ever the warrior monk ready for a fight. Taking a breath to steady himself Benjen, Vth of his name, began.\n\n"Councillors, It is good to see you all again. I have been giving the current state of Chital a great deal of thought since our last meeting and I am now ready to share with you all my new grand design, The unification of Chital. For too long we allowed ourselves to bend to the whims of traitors, terrorists and instigators who seek to divide us. We have been kind, we have been fair, we have tried to help them and they have spat in our face.” Bhushan grunted disapprovingly. "That is all going to change. It is time we end the threat at our doors once and for all. We will make every loyal deer feel safe in their homes, protected and guarded against those who would destroy our traditions. A massive effort is needed with the deployment of troops and the agents of the state. I will need each voice round this table to help me in this but we must be of one mind. You all have your unique talents which can be brought to bear in this united effort. If we are to protect our deer, our livelihoods and our country we must crush these dissidents with such force that no others will ever raise their voice against us again.”\n\nFinishing with a grave scowl Benjen regarded his fellow councillors once again. Davirtannen looked horrified while Eva seemed deeply conflicted. Hira appeared relaxed but disapproving, her eyes watching the others closely. Ivar appeared to be trying to figure out what to make of it. Worst of all Bhushan looked ready for a fight, veins in his neck bulging as he glared daggers at Benjen. The only one round the table who appeared to approve was Jakob, who sat up just that bit straighter than before a slight smile on his lips to reassure Benjen."

Bhushan accepted the greeting with a nod, ever the warrior monk ready for a fight. Taking a breath to steady himself Benjen, Vth of his name, began.\n\n"Councillors, It is good to see you all again. I have been giving the current state of Chital a great deal of thought since our last meeting and I am now ready to share with you all my new grand design, the harmony of the masses. Chital has been divided for too long and whilst struggling against its own confused identity hostility has festered. There are deer who do not feel welcome in our nation.” Bhushan grunted in acknowledgement. "That is all going to change. It is time we throw open the doors and make every deer feel they can have a home here, be accepted here, be welcomed for who they are. A massive reform is needed. A reform of the classes, a reform of the economy. I will need each voice round this table to help me in this, for your opinions and views on this matter are unique. You each see the problems in a different way and if we’re to hear the voices of our deer we must first hear the voices of each other. So let us listen, let us try to understand and start making Chital a better place for all.”\n\nFinishing with a smile Benjen regarded his fellow councillors once again. Davirtannen practically beamed while Eva certainly seemed to approve of the message. Hira appeared relaxed and happy. Ivar stomped his hoof in agreement. Even Bhushan looked interested, one eyebrow raised quizzically as he returned Benjen’ s gaze. The only one round the table who appeared downcast was Jakob who looked even more annoyed than before. The old soldier raised his head and spoke."

chital.4.t:0 "A Council For Four"
chital.4.d:0 ""They cannot be trusted.” Jakob slammed his hoof down on the table. "Why they’re even on the council I cannot understand. Forming into their little 3 deer team, calling themselves the Axis, they’re conniving, scheming and paranoid.”\n”Of course they’re paranoid, we’re plotting against them. We meet without them to take decisions that affect them, their provinces, and their deer. Are you really so thick-headed you can’t see why they’re annoyed, why they feel the need to band together just like we have?” Eva returned a salvo of her own from the other end of the table.\n"Perhaps if they showed a bit more gratitude for their positions they’d be included more. Their loyalty and duty should be too Chital, they should be honoured to be allowed to speak not grumbling about their complaints being ignored. Look at Davirtannen, he wouldn’t go about sneaking and plotting would he?"\n"Don’t drag me into this.” The industrialist added from his chair - his attempts to go unnoticed clearly hadn’t worked.\n\n"Don’t be an old fool Jakob, the only way we can move this body forward is if we start to work together not plot behind closed doors and hurl insults at each other. Put yourself in their hooves” Eva continued.\n"I am not in their hooves; I am in my hooves. I see things the way they are, not clouded by some vision of the future that doesn’t exist right now. Wake up Eva or are you just a coward?” Jakob spat back.\n\n"Enough!” Benjen Vth shouted. "Enough of this both of you, I will not listen to any more of your bickering. Go, you both need to cool off.” Eva and Jakob sat motionless, staring death at each other. "Go! Now!” The force of his demand shook both of them from their feud. Pausing only to bow to Benjen on their way out, the two stormed from the room, slamming doors as they went\n"Well, that was heated.” Benjen sighed, head in hooves. "Thanks to all of that I’ve forgotten what we were discussing. What was this meeting even meant to be about?”\n"The reforms Yaril.” Davirtannen offered.\n"Ah yes, your proposed reforms.” Benjen visibly brightened. "Well, I’m sure we can handle those just the two of us, we agree on most points anyway, correct?”\n"Indeed we do Yaril, shall we begin?”"
chital.4.a:0 "An excellent agenda."

chital.5.t:0 "News From The South"
chital.5.d:0 "Eva poured over the reports, her concern growing with every new page, paragraph, and sentence. What started out as a minor incident in a corner of the Yarildom had grown into the very real threat of a communist rising across several provinces. This figure, Dannya Shah, had manage to turn a handful of discontent farmers into a militia that was doing considerable damage. Reports of blown trainlines, kidnappings, gunrunning and extorsion were becoming more frequent. The fragile economy was beginning to suffer and so her advice had been requested. She couldn’t understand it. They hadn’t issued any demands, made any statements about their intent other than to call themselves communists, they acted more like a gang than a political army running around causing all kinds of problems without any real drive.\n\nThey’d arrive in a region, Dannya would give a few speeches, rally some support then they’d sabotage something and move on. Round and round the provinces they went; Mahorna, Haarihus and Gondeerana had suffered but worse still was the implications of this tactic. Keeping up momentum like that requires more than just charisma and drive, it requires bits. Some outside agency was supplying the rebels with money and equipment, she was sure of it. With the current supply shortages of the army every gun and bullet was tracked and accounted for, the weapons had to be coming from somewhere else. The Doelhi confederacy was a possible source, they’d welcome a chance to destabilise the Yarildom, or perhaps it was Sambar, their border disputes went back a long way. Hira was sure to have some information about what was going on, with her help they could get to the bottom of the issue. It would also be a nice gesture to reach out between council members for support. Either way this needed to get fixed, and fast."
chital.5.a:0 "That is certainly worse than we thought."

chital.6.t:0 "Reaching The South"
chital.6.d:0 "The brief was simple, get supplies and troops to Mahorna to help deal with the unrest in the area, but even this had gotten political. Benjen and Jakob had been discussing it for close to an hour as they walked around the grounds of the white tower; the quickest route would take the convoy through Ditar, Bhushan’s territory, Axis lands. Jakob took against this plan, arguing that the convoys should be routed through Gondeerana, Eva Pillai's lands, instead.\n\n"It will add days to their travel time.” Benjen reiterated "There are deer suffering now, we need to help them. How many lives will we lose because of that delay? I cannot have that on my consciousness, it’s heartless.”\n"Benjen, it is better to be heartless than mindless. The history of the world is the story of the triumph of the heartless over the mindless. By routing through Gondeerana we guarantee the security of our forces. We cannot account for ambushes in Ditar and if the convoy is compromised it cannot help anyone. How many lives would be lost then?” The discussion swung back and forwards around this point but there was no hostility in the debate, both deer took it as a chance to educate the other. Benjen sought demonstrate the value of trust to Jakob while, in return, Jakob took the opportunity to educate Benjen on military strategy.\n\n"Bhushan’s local forces can protect the trunks as they travel, he’s a fighter and will know what is required. By trusting his skills, we can engage with the militias all sooner and reassure him of our faith in him.”\n"Combat is not a matter of faith, you do not have faith that your enemy is weaker than you, you gain information, prepare, practice and train, you have to rely upon your own strengths. I have no doubts about Bhusan’s abilities, but these are our troops, we should be the ones protecting them as they protect the civilians. It’s about morale as much as transport.”\n"Hmm, this is harder than I thought it would be.” Benjen pondered, scratching his chin. He took a deep breath of the evening air to clear his thoughts.\n"That’s why I'm here to help. From such small decisions are wars lost and won but know, whichever you go with I will support.” Jakob patted his shoulder reassuringly."
chital.6.a:0 "The Axis's supply lines will protect us."
chital.6.b:0 "Reroute supplies through Pillai lands."

chital.7.t:0 "Her Final Fortress"
chital.7.d:0 "Jakob pushed his way into the command tent, the sounds of distant gunfire in the jungle dwindling as the last of the fighting ceased. Within the tent officers congratulated each other on a job well done, Dannya shah captured, her stronghold broken, her forces scattered. This was a great day for the Chital, but the work was only just beginning. On the far side of the tent, the remainder of the council of 4 awaited his return. As he crossed to them, setting his rifle down on the table, Benjen addressed him.\n\n"The General has informed us of Shah’s capture but there’s a problem, most of her forces have fled into the jungle. If they get away there’s a chance they’ll reform and come back in strength, if we want to go after them, we’ll have to do it now before they can escape.”\n"We should-"\n"Go after them now.” Davirtannen cut Jakob off. "If we capture them, it will stabilise the region and we can turn a new page on this sorry saga. Let the criminals serve their time and we’ll move on with better things.” Jakob, surprised at Davirtannen’s boldness and his plan to pursue the rebels, composed himself.\n"I agree that we need to go after them but to make examples of them. There are other strongholds out there to clear up and no one will believe they’ve genuinely reformed. An enemy beaten is still an enemy, we need to eliminate them.”\n"You think making martyrs of these deer is going to help us?” Eva interjected, a fierce glint in her eye aimed at Jakob. "Let them go, our priority is the locals, those injured in the fighting, those who’ve suffered under the attacks. If we show them kindness, they’ll know the rebels were fighting for a false cause and most of them will slink back to their villages and not trouble us again.” The general approached the table once more.\n\n"Yaril, I need an order. It’s now or never.”"
chital.7.a:0 "Pursue a ruthless assault on remaining CPLF strongholds."
chital.7.b:0 "Imprison them - we must appear strong but fair."

chital.8.t:0 "Looking A Little Deeper"
chital.8.d:0 "Sitting at his desk, deep within the citadel of the White Tower, Benjen lit a candle. It's warm light soothing the stress he felt as he held the letter in his hooves. It bore the cherry red wax seal of Dannya Shah, and its contents may help bring peace to his realm. Opening the document, he began to read...\n\n"To the shadow of Chital,\n\nYou are close to letting your ego get the better of you, I caution you to not probe me for any further action, lest you put our efforts at risk\n\nThough I am thankful for the shipment of weapons, the Yaril came to close to finding them. We'll control the south soon enough and remove the "Kind Viking."\n\nBut when that day is passed, we will need to work out the finer points of this partnership; otherwise, the revolution will not stop with the dynasty of Benjen.\n\nBest Wishes, Dannya Shah"\n\nBenjen blinked a few times and read through the letter again. Who in their right mind would write something like this? At its core, it is a letter to an ally, but why veiled threats? And this "shadow of Chital" talk made Benjen nervous. Though at the same time, he could not help but chuckle at what he read, it truly was a unique specimen.\n\nBut who was this to? Who was providing weapons to the rebels? Wait... the shadow of Chital...\n\n"Could it be Hira?" Benjen wondered to himself, turning to the bed in his study beside him, he spoke to the doe sleeping beneath its sheets. "Ruusu, my dear, could you fetch me a member of the royal police?" The only response from the bed were dreaming groans, "It seems I will need to do this myself." Benjen thought. "But is it worth the risk?""

chital.9.t:0 "The State of the Seven"
chital.9.d:0 "Benjen relaxed into the chair on the balcony overlooking the sea, his shoulders sagging under the weariness of the day; arguments amongst the council had turned a half hour meeting into a two hour one. Small details and the choice words causing flare ups, it didn’t matter that they were all saying the same thing just in different ways, it was like they wanted a fight, they came into the meeting expecting conflict, just like yesterday and the day before. He needed to find something to united them but that was another problem half the time. They knew what needed to be done and agreed upon the goals, the path to those goals was where the issues lay, the demons in the details. He’d never seen people argue so much even though they all agreed with each other, wouldn't it be so much easier if he could just put to sea in a boat and ride the waves instead.\n\n"Gods I hate politics.” He groaned.\n\n"How are you holding up?" she asked, setting a glass of water on the table next to him. He took a deep breath of the evening air and steadied himself.\n\n"I’ll manage. We finalised the agreement of equal education rights so that’s something at least, even if it did take all afternoon."\n\n"You’ve been working too hard recently, how about we go away for the weekend, just the two of us, no late-night meetings, no reviewing documents or issuing statements. A little relaxing getaway will do you a world of good."\n\n"Where would I be without you?" He sighed and laid his head on her shoulder.\n\n"Probably in another council meeting. " She chuckled. "So, tell me, how did it go?""
chital.9.a:0 "Unstable, but beneficial."

chital.10.t:0 "A Meeting With The Godi"
chital.10.d:0 "Tell me Yaril, when was the last time you listened to the gods?” The old godi walked at Benjen’s side; the air was blessedly crisp and warm this evening, sun setting behind the white tower as they strolled through the grounds.\n"Prayer is not really my thing Konnar.” Benjen replied in a placating tone. Konnar chuckled, crown of raven feathers rustling against his antlers.\n"Nor mine but that’s not what I asked. Those who rule above us will do what they will, prayer or no prayer but when was the last time you listened, sat and heard what they had to say.”\n"I... I don’t follow.” Benjen stopped, confusion written across his face, he turned his full attention to Konnar.\n"Well, think of it like this. Everydeer wants something, even the gods, but sifting through them nonsense and hyperbole, to hear what they’re really saying, that’s the trick.”\n"You’re making them sound like politicians.” Benjen laughed.\n"Now you’re hearing my truth.” He smiled. Glancing over the Yaril’s shoulder he saw Eva cross the gardens toward the tower. She smiled and waved at them as she went. Konnar return the gesture. "Do you listen to the truth the ‘gods’ are saying. Do you grasp what they want?”\nBenjen watched Eva as she went.\n"I think so, I just... can’t decide who to listen to.”\n"I’m not here to tell you what’s important, I’m not a missionary. I want you to ask yourself what is most important to you. I cannot make these decisions for you but the wisdom of the godi is yours should you wish it; all I ask is that you hear what we have to say.”"

After leaving Ostkranbi, the Royal Progress, including the Yaril and much of the council, stopped at various stations along the route to the Southern City, picking up passengers on the way. Meeting them in Dehler was Eva and a crowd of Oleno-Hindian officials and notables excited to meet and speak with the Yaril.\n\n"So as you can see my Yaril, by increasing cooperation between Ostkranbi merchant organizations, and southern spice farm owners, we are sure we can increase the economic output of the south by margins unheard of in recent years!" Benjen nodded along silently to one of the Oleno-Hindian representatives, genuinely interested in the nitty-gritty of economic reform and administration. Besides him was Hira, also nodding along, but always eying up others in the train. Turning her eye to the seat across the car, she sees Bhushan, asleep and drooling, entirely bored by all that's happening. Shaking her head, Hira looks around the rest of the cabin. \n\nNot much else is happening, the delegates wine and dine with members of the Yaril's court. No one knows what's going on. This tour is more important than any of them, and they sit drinking and eating.\n\nBenjen stands up, startling Hira, who must have zoned off at some point. "Well, thank you sir, I'm delighted we could meet, and I love your ideas and plans." Benjen glances down at Hira, meeting her gaze for a second, with an intensity unlike him. Turning back to the delegate, "I hope we can meet in Ostkranbi soon, and we can put those plans into action. Come, let's go get something to eat."\n\nAs they walk away, Hira trots over to the sleeping Bhushan, and shakes him aggressively, waking up he glares at Hira, "What is it Madam?"\n\n"The plan needs to begin.""

It had taken all of Hira's southern spies, the promise of a thousand favors for Bhushan and the Tuya, and even a few reports out of Hoversholm's seat in Valdeland, but at last, some small part of the centuries of Hindian humiliation was erased.\n\nSome nights ago, as a hundred caravans of rich Chitali traders, bureaucrats, and nobledeer transporting trafficked native labor and ill-gotten bounties of Mahimata arrived in the great city of Gondeerana, Bhushan's Tuya emerged from the shadows to meet them. Masked deer wielding holy two-handed scimitars carried off cargo, slaughtered guards, and took prisoner hundreds of deer behind the exploitation of their own brothers and sisters. The spoils were distributed among the hungry folk of Gondeerana, those pressed back into thralldom returning to their homelands on caravans commandeered by Tuya stalwarts. For those choice caravaneers found to be funneling opium and other such poisons to the people of the South, or known to be among Jakob and Eva's inner circles, the Tuya did not give them the mercy of a trial in Ostkranbi, instead holding impromptu religious trials that found them guilty on the spot.\n\nFollowing the carnage in Gondeerana, Ramachan's own agents turned their attention to the letters of Haarihus, of Fraskal, of Kanelimpra and Ostkranbi all, which now formed a great ledger of nobles and bureaucrats known to be involved in economic impressment, corruption, and violent reprisals. Prosperous plantations one day soon found themselves without owners the next as a brutal campaign of assassination and intimidation menaced those who would dare harm the children of Mahimata. Scores of allies of the Axis of Chital, of course, found themselves candidates for every vacancy.\n\nAs she pondered on the days before her, the Chief Minister and spymistress turned a letter, and another, and another, and simply smiled - instead of Madame Hira Ramachan, they were all written for "Mother Hira", the blessed matriarch of Chital."

For the past weeks, he has continued to badger Ramachan over her reluctancy to enshrine the Godi as the official leaders of Chitali religious life, declaring that the Yarildom's devotion to the traditional values of Olenian religious culture must come first, before any populist promises or democratic reforms.\n\n"If we give the Mahimatists and their backwards, destructive ideology any more power, they will eradicate the entire vision of the godi as we know it, and make this country some kind of primitivist mother cult devoted to the destruction of all of the gains the Yaril's government has made in the past few years," Konnar had angrily said during the conference, slamming his hoof upon the table, "The Tuya are terrorists, and the Mahimatists have allowed them to operate, cleansing the countryside of all opposition to the Yaril! What Chital needs is tradition, glory, and to be ruled by the Olenians and their Gods again. If any syncretism must be done, I say, Mahimata shall only reign as a goddess within the pantheon, and among equals."\n\nKonnar's doctrine of the supremacy of the Olenian temples, however, have been challenged by others at the court, especially Bhushan Gurat, a member of the Axis of Chital and close friend to Hira Ramachan. Bhushan, a member of the Tuymaiyānatu religious militia and staunch devotee of the Hindian religion, has proposed that if the religions are ever unified, Mahimata should rank above the other gods as a mother figure in accordance with core Mahimatist monotheistic principles.\n\n"Konnar is incorrect, clearly, and continues to spew his propaganda about Mahimatist principles and Mahimata as a goddess," Bhushan declared, "Mahimata is the mother of all Hindians, and the Olenians would only like to see us return to the corrupt modernism of the vapid Olenian temple system. They would have us destroy our lands, end our traditional structures, and eradicate our own culture so that we can return to some kind of "sound" governance."

"It is for that reason that I have called you here - to rise from the ashes of the old council and bring a new system for Chital, one that does not pretend to support the voices of all Chitali, but one that does what it says it will.

Although many in the court suspect Hira is using Bhushan as a front for her own operations, the new rebellion has taken up the name and flag of the Tuymaiyānatu, a native religious sect determined to protect their lands and faith from what they believe is an encroachment by a foreign Yaril. Bhushan, a staunch member of the organization and one of the movement's leaders, has declared already that Benjen wants "nothing but to see our ancient customs and traditions anihillated under the boot of what he calls progress."\n\nOur scouts believe the Tuymaiyānatu have a significant prescence in Hira's domain in Haarihus, along with Bhushan's in Mahorna. Interestingly enough, Bhushan and his warlords have also managed to take much of the native province of Gondeerana, controlled by Axis sympathizer Eva Pillai. If the native Eva Pillai decides to let the rebels into the city itself, nation-wide turmoil could endure, and the Yaril's reign over all of Chital might even be threatened.\n\nThe situation is grim, and all eyes are on the Yaril's next move to answer the rebellion."

Thankfully, none of those protests reached the site of the port itself, and Aattohamn now stands as a possible landing ground for an invasion of [SRI.GetName], or simply a center of trade to facilitate the mass amounts of Chitali spices exported to Macawia and the Griffonian South.\n\nAlthough debates have erupted on the usage of the port, postponing much of Chital's political activity, one proposal has made its way through - a motion to dedicate Aattohamn to the Chitali workers who built the port town. While squabbling continued on the matter of what the port town should actually be dedicated to, the spirit of the proposal itself has seen widespread support. All that is left to decide about the future of the new hub of commerce and naval engineering, it seems, is the exact dedication."

chital.52.d:0 "His front hooves were shaking when Benjen Davirtannen wandered into the den of Hira Ramachan for the very first time - the seat of the sypmistress and now Diwan's iron hold over the Yarildom of Chital.\n\nHira had summoned him to a meeting after months of uncertainty, where Benjen continued to pace around the old factory, instructing his workers and drafting up policies for reform that would all end up in the wastebasket. Hira was no Benjen, and Davirtannen did not want to risk his reputation and livelihood by pushing for reform too much. Hoversholm may be tolerated, but him? No doubt Davirtannen was a symbol of the old regime to Hira, a decadent industrialist with no interest in sharing any of his power with poor Olenian nor any Southern native.\n\nNow, however, that fragile peace between them had been shattered, and Davirtannen found himself before Hira, crowned in the finest regalia fit only for a Princess of Chital, let alone a humble spymistress, and Bhushan and Marsha Gurat, her willing puppets in the grand quest for power that had taken the young deer to rulership.\n\n"Madame Hira," Davirtannen bowed, "I had not expected that you would call upon me now, some months after you had first taken power, not of course that I had any reservations about such a coup. My only duty is to serve Chital, of course, and accomplish the great goals of the Benjen IV Industrial Bureau."\n\nHe forced a smile while Hira entertained a whisper from Bhushan. The delicate little noble who had first been appointed to the position of councildeer so many years ago now seemed a giant, and Davirtannen knew the fate of his operations was all in her hands - Hira's. The famously fickle and jovial lady who spent most her time in public laughing with others, reading and listening cheap Equestrian entertainment, and if the rumors about deviancy were true, certain... other things, was the sole arbiter of the position of the old and weathered industrialist, but Davirtannen wondered if all that fanfare was just an act, a disguise. It didn't matter now. What mattered was her response.\n\n"I have called you hear for many reasons Davirtannen, but hearing your old spiel about service to the crown was unfortunately not one of them," Hira smiled to herself and Marsha Gurat snickered next to her, "The fact is that I have missed exacting the judgement of the Axis upon you, as one of the Council, but I had been pondering your place in Chital for many months."\n\nA pause took the room as Hira chose her next words with careful deliberation:"

To Ivar Hoversholm, however, it was simply politics, and to his benefit, the people of Chital tended to forget their past convictions when their Kansleri took to the stage.\n\n"Countrydeer," the Kansleri began, adjusting his loose tie and gleaming at the audience, "What I am to announce is both unfortunate, necessary, and glorious - an end to an age of reaction and treachery, but the fall of many of Chital's old heroes, who in a time long before now I once considered my greatest allies."\n\n"The inner circle of Benjen V, his puppetmasters... you have heard my refer to them as "Progressives", but now, I shall be blunt - they are nothing more than traitors. Before I came to power they preached reform, spoke of a future of peace, justice, and harmony for the Chitali people and unity to heal the Oleno-Hindian conflict - worthy goals, I'm sure we would all agree. But now? Now? They have abandoned their past pretenses, our exceptional visions, and attempted, with all their power, to lead the government of and by the people to utter and complete collapse, for the sole goal of removing me, a "bigoted anti-harmonic despot", from power."\n\nHoversholm pictured them in his mind, and his blood curdled - Katarina, his sister, who in the great jealousy of an older, neglected sibling betrayed him the moment Benjen V cast him out, and Ninnesen, the traitor, who appeased the court in one breath and condemned them in the next. It brought him a peace nothing else could bring him that these does would soon fall beneath the might of the Republic.\n\n"Under the cover of shadows, these members of the secret "Council of Six" plotted to destroy the fruits of my regime and... with no doubt finance an Equestrian-backed coup with the help of the repulsive S.M.I.L.E - and now, they stand detatched from any substantive positions of power.

A hasty request for the position of Chief Minister, a denial, a violent reaction from Hoversholm and then an equally brutal one from the Yaril, though, resigned that once-so-tangible power to nothing more than a historical footnote. Humilation followed, cries of schemer and traitor and power-hungry usuper, but Hoversholm could do little to defend himself, for in the end it all was true.\n\nWhen the Council of Seven opened yet again, he found himself among the opposition - not as Ivar the Reformer nor Ivar the Traitor - but as Ivar the Chameleon, a humble member of the Axis of Chital, and a voice of passion, reason, and kindness to all in court - and as a voice of snide and condescending disapproval behind their backs. Hoversholm preferred to think of this new persona not as one of contradictions, but one based only in simple bendings of the truth to further his own superior ideals, and the prosperity of all of Chital as a result. Smiling, he recalled moments laughing off the Axis to the face of Benjen, then plotting in shadowed meetings with that same group of deer, all the while speaking fondly of the common traditionalist deer to Jakob the Grey.\n\nIf all went well this next session of the Council, that friendly face to both the Yaril and the Axis would be Hoversholm, and a simple change of pace could grant him the power to bring prosperity to Chital's children for generations."

It had been the crowning ideal of the reign of Benjen IV to move into the Industrial Revolution as in Equestria and the Griffonian Empire had, and it was the job of Davirtannen to make sure every one of Benjen IV's reforms actually functioned as intended. And work he did, each and every day, to make sure Benjen V did not have to bear the public relations nightmare of an industrial accident, machinery collapse or brutal injury to some young apprentice.\n\n"Each death for us is another tool for Bhushan to continue his anti-technological fury and continue to keep technology out of the south," Benjen IV had told him matter-of-factly when he originally appointed Davirtannen to his position as overseer of Ostkranbi industrial affairs, "One accident could cause a chain reaction that would tear the whole south apart in fury - a fury you know whould be directed against us, and only us."\n\nThere was truth to that, Davirtannen knew. Although he could still not comprehend some of the sheer absuridty of the tactics of the jackals in the Chitali government, Benjen IV had taught him much about the court, lessons that would translate to his rise to more and more powerful positions during the reigns of the next two Yarils. Davirtannen could not shake off the feeling, as he walked, however, that he had made the wrong choices. That Jakob or Hira or even Hoversholm, his old ally, would someday devour him, and crush the old breaucrat under the spirit of a new age of reform.\n\nIf there was anything he could do, it was to move on with his projects, make them as efficient as possible, innovate into electronics, industry, RADAR - to make himself so vital to the spirit of Benjen IV's modernizations that he would be more than a politician or an opportunistic reformer. Then, Davirtannen would triumph, and guide the Yaril through an age of wisdom and reason."

chital.109.d:0 "Benjen Davirtannen was in his office, writing yet another report to the Yaril about the affairs of the factories of Ostkranbi, when he was approached by agents of Jakob the Grey, clad in military uniform. He could of course recognize Ieffri Huddarnen, one of his least favorite deer among the nobility - a backwards traditionalist with little respect for the Yaril he was supposed to serve by his own royalist principles. Among him was a diplomat of House Gadra - no doubt Sanjay, the young conservative rebel. Both misguided deer, dreaming of a world where they, the traditionalists, were the only clique capable of saving Chital, and where deer like Davirtannen and Ninnesen were all crypto-markists, traitors and radicals working from within to corrupt the Yaril. No doubt some on the left wished they were right, but Davirtannen was no radical Marksist.\n\n"Benjen," Sanjay Gadra smiled, glancing down at a paper stamped by the Yaril himself, "You are hereby relieved of your duties as chief executive officer of the Royal Manufacturing and Electronics Corporation and chief advisor to the Yaril on the matters of welfare and industry. By the.. er... orders of Diwan Jakob Kudlinen, and Benjen himself."\n\nA sour feeling came over Davirtannen, but he knew better than to resist an order from Jakob the Grey.\n\n"Of course, Mr. Gadra," Davirtannen bowed, "I was glad I could serve my Yaril while I could. Do tell - will my industries themselves be nationalized?"\n\nGadra and Huddarnen glanced at eachother with shock, as if they thought Benjen another Ninnesen, ready to defend their harmonic beliefs to the face of any traitor. For Benjen Davirtannen, however, it was different.\n\n"Of course not, sir..." Gadra could not find the words to continue.\n\n"Good. Well I shall be off then, as I still have factories to inspect among my own domain. for the glory of..." Benjen smirked, "Jakob the Grey and his loyal Yaril.""

I would hardly call your mission anything but ceremonial, Jakob," his lieutenant, the young freed thrall turned officer Pensha Rashanth, turned and gave him a smile, "It's clear the Yaril cares little for your advice, and why would he? Too busy listening to - who's that new doe - Ninessen? They tried to hold me up as a progressive native officer once... ah, I remember how my disapproval to follow their every whim shook the Yaril's little clique..."\n\nJakob snorted and let out yet another sigh as the carriage bumped along the western road to Ostkranbi, his eyes glancing out the window to the open farms and plantations of Kanelimpra. "I have served in the courts of three Yarils, but our little nephew Ben seems more and more interested in disregarding my knowledge and lending his ears to weak-willed traitors," Jakob responded, "Progressives grow boldened and so does the Axis... would that he would take a lesson from his father and let me do what I do best. No doubt I would have all of them fired within days - at my nicest."\n\n"That kind of talk would get you nowhere with him, Jakob." Pensha gave a sigh of her own, "You are a dying breed in Ostkranbi, remember that. Your allies are all here, just waiting for you to strike - not that the vultures circling you are even remotely fit for advisory."\n\nJakob gave a grimace and turned his gaze from outside to himself. Haggard, frail, and tired - that was what the hero of Chital had been reduced to.

Due to the possible involvement of Jakob the Grey in such a far-right conspiracy Hoversholm has announced the process of coronation will be on hiatus (read: never)
chital.117.d:0 "The city of Ostkranbi was still in crisis two days later. No one had seen or heard from the Yaril that whole time, and no decrees came out of the white tower to instruct the rulership of the realm. Guards never before seen guarded the doors, and the city was effectively on lockdown. Everything was suspicious and fright, until Hoversholm emerged from the council chambers. Everyone had awaited this briefing, it would tell them what the hell was going on in their nation, and the council must have some answers. But what emerged was not the council as a whole; it was just Ivar himself, dressed in his signature loose suit and glasses, looking somber as none had seen him before.\n\nStepping to a podium before the assembled reporters, he began to speak, "My dear countrydeer. A great tragedy has befallen this nation. During the Royal Progress two days ago, our Yaril Benjen was kidnapped and killed by far-right, reactionary generals, including General Huddarnen. Since then, national soldiers have had the city on lockdown to search for clues, and I apologize for waiting this long to inform you all. We needed all the evidence first. And from that search, we can also place incriminating evidence on another figure, Jakob the Grey for participating in the plot." At this, the crowd gasped, while before they had been silent in shock now, they were outraged. The ancient advisor betraying the Yaril?! Many were confused, but many more seethed with anger. Ivar continued, "Due to the collaboration of the nobles in this plot, it has been decided we will be postponing the coronation of a successor until further notice, and I will be assuming the title of Kansleri of Chital. I would like to ask you to postpone asking any further questions, for I must take my time to grieve. Benjen was a close friend of mine, and I must now make my peace as well."\n\nIvar exited the stage as the crowd erupted in shock and rage at what he had told them, republican chants began to rise amongst them as reporters rushed to get the story to the presses and broadcast it all over Chital.\n\nWalking back into the council chambers, Ivar Hoversholm sighed and said to himself, "Sorry old friend. I did what I had to do for Chital to survive.""

But he knew he would never see that city again, or at least not for many years. Opening the paper in front of him, he read the headline, "Yaril Benjen dead! Jakob the Grey and Noble Generals Implicated!" And smack in the middle of the page, a picture of Ivar Hoversholm, the new Great Kansleri. The deer scoffed; this was the respect he got then. I guess this is what he got for doing what he thought was right.\n\nLooking down from his porch, he could see one of the guards, red and blue insignia on his shoulder—the flag of the new Confederation. The door beside him opened, and his wife emerged. At least now, they were able to be married—the stress of rulership off his shoulders.\n\n"Do you need some more dear?" she asked. He replied with a soft voice, "No, my rose, I still have enough. I haven't been able to drink much with all that is going on." "Would you like to talk about it?" she responded. The deer laughed, "You know I've already said plenty. But it's all the same, I guess. I just feel uncertain. This nation was supposed to be under my care. But here it is, under his." The doe frowned, "But you trust him, do you not? Try to think about the best in things!"\n\nBenjen smiled.

Hoofball is a long-time passion of the Kansleri, who discovered the sport during in Jezeragrad during one of his many tours of the Republics of Griffonia and was enraptured by it ever since.\n\nHoversholm, however, has been quick to deny any rumours that he founded the league as a personal vanity project, declaring that he hopes for investors across Zebrica and Griffonia to put money into teams in Chital and eventually formulate new international club competitions to further bolster a sense of cross-continental republican unity. The sport is a key pastime within the Republics of the River Federation and in Sicameon, but has never seen broad popularity in Chital, leading many Southern activists and even Olenian traditionalists to decry the move as an imposition of a foreign cultural tradition upon a nation with a rich sporting history of its own. Olenians have recommended deer hockey as a new national sport for Chital, while Hindians have countered with the suggestion of Kabaddi, a classical tackle sport of Hindia, but neither are too keen on the idea of imposing hoofball for hoofball's sake, regardless of the sport's popularity internationally.\n\nThe Kansleri has used his clear majority in parliament to pass the initiative as it stands, but large amounts of foreign and domestic money pouring into the league without proper domestic support would only spell a public relations disaster for the Republican Party government. Hoversholm's foreign contacts have encouraged the move to go ahead and the people's game to expand to Chital, but would such a deer of the people risk the empty stadiums and washed-up Riverlander sensations that could turn Chital's hoofball league into a farce?"

The symbols may have been torn down - Benjen V is nowhere to be seen and presumed dead by all but the most conspiratorial of traditionalists, Hira and Bhushan have returned to the shadows and taken the Tuya with them, and Jakob the Grey lies in the halls of the Olenian Pantheon - but the anger remained, and now, new leaders have wrapped their tendrils around the minds of the Chitali people.\n\nIn Ostkranbi, the papers of Benjen's lackey Raili Ninessen and the snake Katarina who bears a Hoversholm name have escaped any attempt at censorship and instead are now in the hooves of every urban elite and Equestrianized academic, and all decry our Kansleri not for his reformism, but his "right-wing socialist, state-promoted social hierarchy and an assimilation of all Chitali with our wonderful differences into a militarized band of republican fanatics standing against all hopes of a harmonic future."\n\nIf such progressive jargon is unappealing, one can only look at what the traditionalists of the East and the Tuya of the South distribute, each painting the Kansleri as a member of the other. He is a viking lord reborn, a devotee of assimilationism, and has publicly admitted to ordering the extrajudicial killings of thousands of Ostkranbi Tuya, yet also has used the Tuya as his own paramilitary force to raid temples of the Olenian Pantheon and sacrificed Jakob the Grey on the altar of his bloodthirsty Goddess, even while simultaneously promoting athiestic thought and announcing the collectivization of hundreds of thousands of acres of noble estates across Chital to be put in the hands of mindless freed thralls.\n\nIf all that were true, at least our Kansleri would have the power to deal with this slander directly, but he has not even been afforded that luxury, as there are now whispers of such Jakobite rhetoric in the army as well. We must take measures to rebuild Hoversholm's personal popularity, if it even existed in the first place, or risk the destruction of the Republican Revolution in Chital before it began."

chital_news.1.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]The last steps to truly enshrine Equestrianist harmony as the dominant ideology across all of Hindia were taken today, as Benjen V Kudlinen, Yaril of Chital and staunch reformist, was officially coronated as King Benjen I of Hindia. His Chief Minister and numerous advisors were seen at the event, and have already begun to set the stage to complete the grand task of the unification of such a shattered continent. As the war for the subcontinent came to a close, neither traditionalist Yarildoms or princely federations emerged as the dominant force in the Northeast of Zebrica.

Benjen V now stands as Benjen I, Sea-King of all Hindians, but his throne is powerless. Instead, power in Chital and now Hindia lies in Jakob the Grey, the Yaril's premier advisor. A staunch traditionalist and an old war hero, Benjen's uncle has established himself as the most powerful deer in a new viking Hindia guided not by bureaucrats or power-hungry warlords, but by military deer devoted to the values of the past.

A brutal but beloved warlord, Bhushan overthrew the Oleno-Hindian government of Chital in favor of a purely native government centralized around the goddess Mahimata and her most militant followers in Chital, the Tuya. A member of the anti-government Axis of Chital before his ascendancy to power, many have certain reservations about Bhushan's ties to spymistress Hira Ramachan. Comparisons to the Storm King or allegations of puppetry aside, none can deny that the imposing Bhushan Gurat has built a powerful and populist Hindia on the backs of his adoring followers, and will surely be a force to be reckoned with."

 ### TRAITS AND DESCS ###
 
 CTL_BENJEN_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 6th of June, 975 in Ostkranbi\n\n§YBiography§!: They say that uneasy lies the head that wears the crown, and that cannot be more true for Benjen V Kudlinen, Yaril of Chital and staunch reformist, beset on all sides by scheming nobles, traitorous former allies, and heartless revolutionaries.\n\nBenjen V was never a warrior like the old Sea-Kings of the continent, raiders who ravaged the Eastern seaboard of Zebrica and subjugated the native deer under their rule from Sambar to Doehli. Born in Ostkranbi, the capital of Chital, to Benjen IV Kudlinen, Benjen would be trained in stewardship from a young age. An intelligent and soft-spoken young deer, he was quick to make friends with numerous noble children and even the older deer at court, and was consistently applauded by his father, even if he was not exactly the most diligent of deer. Even when his father died in 998, and his brother, Aatto, became Yaril of Chital, Benjen remained gregarious and ready to take up the mantle of chief advisor to his brother.\n\nThe Yaril's life, however, would soon come crashing down. Aatto died in 1001 pacifying native rebels, and Benjen was forced to carry on the torch of the Kudlinen Dynasty. His chief advisors annuled his engagement to his fiancé, a commondeer, and Benjen was left ruling over a Yarildom that condemned him as a fat steward and doe-ish coward - "The Kind Viking". Slowly replacing Aatto's advisors with his own old friends, Benjen's reign culminated in the establishment of the Council of Seven in 1003 - meant to serve as a united advisory council of both Hindian and Olenian nobles, all originally loyal to the Yaril. Unfortunately, his opposition on the council began to resent him, and three of his greatest adversaries on it formed the Axis of Chital, to curtail what they believed to be his blatant abuses of power and failure to bring reform to Chital.\n\nWith the Council becoming more and more hostile, it seems Benjen will need to act fast if he wants to ensure the survival of Chital - and his dynasty.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: MonAx"
 
 CTL_IVAR_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 29th of July, 966 in Hamaholm\n\n§YBiography§!: Five years ago, Ivar Hoversholm was the most powerful deer in the Chitali government, one of the Yaril's closest friends and most competent advisors. Now, however, he is a shell of his former self, disgraced among the nobility, and consumed with a cold, silent hatred for all of the traitors that now rule his nation.\n\nBorn in Hamaholm in the Thanedom of Valdeland to a caring noble family, Ivar Hoversholm was considered a gifted child from birth - a fact that would propel him into the politics of the nation's capital. Ivar and his father, Elik, became voices of reformism and the rule of law on then Yaril Benjen IV's council, and when Elik resigned his courtly duties out of old age in 1000, Ivar became even more influential in the coastal nation's court. Close friendships with industrialist Benjen Davirtannen and then heir to throne Benjen Kudlinen made Ivar a prime candidate for a spot on the Yaril's advisory council, which would eventually become the Council of Seven in 1003.\n\nHowever, with the establishment of the Council of Seven, came Ivar's undoing. Hoversholm, ever the opportunist, saw in the Council the instrument of true reformism, and in a midnight coup, demanded Benjen grant him the long-vacant post of Chief Minister and leadership of the body. Benjen, astonished by what he believed to be a blatant power-grab, expelled Hoversholm from his inner circle and shattered his political influence. Hoversholm, convinced of a conspiracy against him, privately denounced the monarchy, and found safety in the Axis of Chital - more reactionary than the Yaril, but as a road to power in Chital, second to none.\n\nNow, Hoversholm's reliance on the Axis as the instrument of his vengeance against Benjen has succeeded, but whether Hoversholm's reforms can succeed is another tale entirely.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: bunnyshrubby"

 CTL_JAKUB_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 8th of July, 943 in Kanelimpra\n\n§YBiography§!: Jakob "the Grey" Kudlinen - younger brother of Benjen IV, gracious and loyal uncle of Benjen V and his brother Aatto, and now, the most powerful deer in Chital.\n\nBorn two years after the heir to the throne, Benjen IV Kudlinen, Jakob the Grey has always been second-in-consideration - for Yaril of Chital, for chief of Chital's great Viking navy and army, and then, for Chief Minister with the establishment of Council of Seven. While his brother sought to bring fire and blood into the lands of the natives and the glories of the industrial revolution into the lands of Chital, Jakob was right beside him, with an exemplary education in Macawia's top naval academies. A fierce raider before the practice was eventually discouraged by the internationalist Benjen IV, Jakob soon became a war hero to the people of Chital as he fought the influence of Macawian pirates and upstart Hindian revolutionaries through the reign of three Yarils.\n\nNow, however, life for Jakob is much different. A military deer at heart, he has found himself in the upper echelons of government, whispering into the ear of Benjen V and promoting a return to the traditions that made Chital great at every turn. A loyalist to Benjen IV, Jakob has never kept his clear resistance to the Yaril's reformist views silent, and with the aid of extremist military elements, his new base of power, he has become the most prominent right-wing royalist in all of Chital.\n\nIf he can balance his far-right general staff and the hostility of an increasingly rebellious Yaril toward the traditionalists, Jakob will not only be enshrined in Chital's futures as a war hero, but as the greatest statesdeer to grace the nation.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: MonAx"

 CTL_HIRA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 22nd of November, 976 in Haarihus\n\n§YBiography§!: Too many in Chital are born with blue blood and the blessing of Ukko, with not a connection in their life to the plight of those at the bottom.\n\nThe same cannot be said for Hira Ramachan. Plucked from obscurity and relative poverty, Hira first rose to prominence in the south following the appointment of her father, Jheri, as Mayor of Haarihus during Aatto's great pacification of the southern lords. From then, she was sent to Ostkranbi to plead for further priveleges for the destitute natives and former thralls of her father's lowly seat, in the process catching the eye of then Kronprins Benjen Kudlinen. When Aatto died, Benjen V then found a sure ally in the young noble, who remained out of the ancient traditionalist clique of rulers Aatto surrounded himself with.\n\nHira, however, soon became much more than just a puppet spymistress. Her missions to root out traitors in the South saw her make covert allies in resistance movements while on the other hoof declaring to Benjen that they were all "sorted out", and her missions to discover secrets among the court led her to uncover a disturbing amount of information on each and every of Benjen V's Council of Seven - Benjen, of course, received barely any of it.\n\nNow, Hira continues scheming as the leader of the Axis of Chital, and with a united alliance of Southern upstarts, disgraced nobles, charmed bureaucrats, and true populists, the young spymistress has now fully consolidated her hold over the nation.\n\nWhether she shall forge a society of equity and tolerance or simply reverse the roles of power is unknown, but the choices are all hers to make.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Kessel" 

 CTL_BHUSHAN_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 2nd of June, 971 in Mahorna\n\n§YBiography§!: Normally, an aristocrat who promotes open disobidience to an established rule of law is purged, killed, or otherwise removed from office within days. Bhushan Gurat, through either a reputation of icompetence, status as a useful extremist, or a reputation as such a barbaric force of will that many are too scared to even challenge him, has remained an open opponent of House Kudlinen for a decade since the young native first inherited the seat of Mahorna.\n\nA firebrand religious populist, Bhushan the Brash, as he is called, is one of the most extreme politicans in Chital, but yet commands a sizable and extremely devoted movement - the Tuya, "Faithful" in the native Chitali language. A militarist religious order of Mahimata, the mother goddess of the Hindians, the Tuya have fought against the Olenian pantheon ever since Bhushan first took command of a once-weak organization of squabbling theologians which bore that name.\n\nPerhaps the most powerful Southern noble in Chital, Gurat was appointed to the Council of Seven as a voice to appease his subjects in Mahorna, part of the vast native Hindian population, who he soon became a key voice of. Brash and bumbling, many view Bhushan as nothing more than a charlatan playing with fire and dreams greater than his own, but little, if any, doubt his convictions - his fanatic Chitali patriotism, his love for his people - and his desire to make the heavenly mother come to Ostkranbi, whatever the cost in blood may be.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: MonAx" 

 GENERAL_SANJAY_DESC:0 "§YBiography§!: Sanjay Gadra, a distant heir to the fortunes of House Gadra, an Oleno-Hindian upon the outskirts of Gondeerana, is a loyalist to Jakob the Grey and Ieffri Huddarnen, who he is seldom seen without. Together, the two have formed a bloc in the army promoting the continued usage of trench tactics and an aggressive foreign policy in response to the Hindian threat.\n\nSanjay has risen to a relatively high position in the army, one surprisngly high for his military expertise, solely because of his connections with his industrialist and arms manufacturer family in House Gadra. With experience in the air force as well as in the armed forces, Sanjay Gadra echoes his family's ties to the grand pursuit of flight and their continued lip service to the army and the traditionalist forces of Jakob the Grey.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Riley Vinchers"

 GENERAL_LIEM_DESC:0 "§YBiography§!: Allies of Liem Wesfelt, born in the eastern fields of Kanelimpra, would describe him as a visionary general and a powerful and promising member of the young officer corps of Chital. His enemies, however, would paint a much different picture, focusing largely upon his great abuses of power in service to Jakob the Grey and sheer brutality of his anti-resistance methods.\n\nBeloved among the Oleno-Hindians, the young officer has already completed numerous tours of duty against the natives in the South, ones that have seen violence and bloodshed on the scale of the efforts of the Iron Regent in Sambar. However, many whisper that Wesfelt's ascendancy to power will soon collapse - if Benjen V and the reformists have their way.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Riley Vinchers"

 GENERAL_LUDEN_DESC:0 "§YBiography§!: From Katiava, Vaalan ventured alone inland on the scent of spice and adventure, securing a small parcel of land in the wilds near the forests of Merkaanan to build up a plantation of his own. Past the initial excitement, life was warm, life was pleasant, and life was boring. That was until a hostile CPLF incursion swept through the locality.\n\nWith the spirit of adventure burning boldly within, Vaalan decided he might as well try his own hoof at dealing with the issue, and left everything behind to roam the area in search of the raiders. He followed their movements, harassing and sabotaging them around the clock, using whatever means he had at his disposal. Vaalan was always careful to disappear away into the brush when things got too troublesome, until finally the group retreated.\n\nOnce he realized he actually had a knack for this kind of work, Vaalan began to informally organize and offer joint ventures with others who had also suffered from beasts, bandits, or other groups, growing bolder and traveling further by the operation. Almost all of his time was spent somewhere out in the wilds. Eventually, his antics got to be enough that a local noble presented him with an ultimatum: To either put his skills to use with a generously given commission into the Chitali military, or be hunted down himself as an outlaw subverting Chitali authority.\n\nThe choice, though sudden, was simple enough, and with time, Vaalan turned his lowly commission into a respectable rank.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Truffle Shine\n §YAdditions by§!: AquaMuro"

 GENERAL_NAT_DESC:0 "§YBiography§!: Born in 976 AD to the family of one of the Yaril Benjen VI's commanders,  He was raised to follow the family trade, war, brutal and unjust. Living his early life in luxury, he grew up among his father's serfs, but soon began to notice the cruelty with which they were treated, and couldn't help feel a pang of emotion in his heart for them. Spending time with them, learning their stories and their lives, he grew close to many of them, and decided he would do everything he could to help.\n\nWith these sympathies, it was no wonder that when offered a chance to study at a military academy in New Mareland, he seized his chance. Finally he could spend time in a land a friendship and harmony, hopefully something he could import back home. Compared to his home... it was like comparing a flower to axe. But he always knew he would need to return home eventually, and try to implement what he had learned. As he finished his studies he recieved a letter from home, his father was dead, killed along with Yaril Aatto in another battle of the never-ending wars against the native populations. Now the owner of his father's estates and riches, he made some changes. Doing far more to help the lives of those who worked under him.\n\nJust the same, he began learning about the new Yaril, Benjen V. He was pessimistic at first, but as he heard more  of "the Kind Viking", he decided he needed to see the deer for himself. Offering his military services, and touting his foreign training, Benjen accepted him into the General Staff. And now, as tensions in Chital continue to grow, Sven still trusts in his king, and is prepared to fight for Chital and for it's people.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: MonAx"

 GENERAL_PENSHA_DESC:0 "§YBiography§!: Originally one of the many thralls recruited in the forests and grasslands of Eastern Chital, in Kanilimpra, Pensha Rashanth was freed during the great reforms of Benjen IV. The young Hindian, eager to prove herself in a sphere of Olenian elites, enlisted in the armed forces from a young age, and caught the eye of Jakob the Grey, who had aided in suppressing resistance and overseeing freed thralls in her native territory for years. Rashanth and Jakob soon became good friends, and the new commander showed a lust for battle that saw her rise in rank faster than any native Chitali before her. In politics, however, her fate would be much less glorious. Rashanth, a freed thrall, was enlisted by countless harmonic activists, chief among them Raili Ninessen, in plans to prop her up as a symbol of a new, progressive Chitali deer that could bridge racial conflicts and fight injustice at home and abroad. The general, however, soon came into conflict with the very harmonists that showed such kindness to her, and following tense periods of debate over her demeanour and conflicts with Jakob, broke with them entirely. Returning to Jakob and the military, Rashanth made amends with the traditionalists, but continues to advocate reform even within their ranks.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: MonAx"

 ### IDEOLOGIES ###
 
 CTL_socialism:0 "Hoversholmism"
 CTL_socialism_desc:0 "Hoversholmism is a branch of social democracy that promotes aspects of political authoritarianism and the supremacy of the executive for the purpose of achieving reformist socialism in developing countries, such as those of the Hindian subcontinent. Although more authoritarian than classical harmonic democracries, Hoversholmists believe that after the initial period of "state developmentalism", true populism can emerge in which a strong, stable, watchful government can anchor policies below the national level based on direct democracy, decentralization, subsidiarity, and above all, solidarity."

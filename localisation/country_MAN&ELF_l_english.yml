LYSIA_DESC:0 "Trained at the prestigious Vesalipolis Military Academy, Lysia was nevertheless relegated to administrative duties working on the Queen's General Staff during the Great War against Equestria. Whilst her classmates achieved glory for the Changeling Lands on the battlefield, she was stuck in Vesalipolis kowtowing to Chrysalis.\n\nHer service to the Queen seemed to have paid off, though, as she was bestowed the title of Protectress over the exalted metropolis of Manehattan following its conquest."
LYSIA_GENERAL_DESC:0 "Trained at the prestigious Vesalipolis Military Academy, Lysia served on the Queen's General Staff during the Great War against Equestria. As the Protectress of Manehattan, Lysia finally has the chance to command her own army on the field in the absence of a native officer corps. Her officer's uniform may not be as glamourous as the ceremonial evening gowns befitting her rank of Protectress, but on campaign with her troops is where Lysia feels most at home."

Built at a cost of millions of changeling Marks, the project was a great boon to the Manehattan military-industrial complex.\n\nTo date, the Soryth-Class is the largest-calibre rifled weapon ever used in combat and, in terms of overall weight, the heaviest mobile artillery piece ever built.

MAN_beginning_1_1_desc:0 "Manehattan may not be in open revolt, but it is not a cowed city. The ponies here are uncooperative at best and actively swindle and sabotage us at worst.

We need more soldiers to cover the Protectorate's large territory, and to do that not only we are going to need local levies, but also a hard core of armoured units to crush any organised resistance.

MAN_beginning_2_1_desc:0 "It's simple, really. Changelings need love to survive. Ponies make love just, like, automatically. Ponies also don't want the Protectorate to bother them much. Think of your day-per-month as a kind of donation. But maintaining the strict quotas for Love imposed on us from Vesalipolis takes up a lot of our ponypower and resources, so Lysia will get Queen Chrysalis to revamp the taxation system."
MAN_beginning_2_2:0 "Liebessteuer- Investmentanleihen"
MAN_beginning_2_2_desc:0 "The bountiful Love harvests of Lysia's demesne attract vast amounts of Changeling immigrants to Eastern Equestria.

MAN_beginning_4b_desc:0 "What's good for the Protectorate is what's good for you! Or that's what they say. Keep your head down, pay your dues, bring in the cash.

MAN_beginning_2a_desc:0 "As much as she tries to spin it as a good thing, Protectress Lysia knows that there's just no way to make getting every pony in town registered and listed sounds fun, or non-threatening. Enter the MO-oPS! Responsible for protecting the citizens of Manehattan, from themselves and each other." 
MAN_beginning_2b:0 "Silence the Academia"
MAN_beginning_2b_desc:0 "The Manehattan Intelligensia are obnoxious, as they were before our arrival. But now they're starting to turn their gaze on us, holding talks and potentially even aiding the Harmonic Resistance. Which doesn't exist, for the record. Either way, the city's academic establishment need to be taught some discipline."
MAN_beginning_2c:0 "Historical Revisionism"
MAN_beginning_2c_desc:0 "In the beginning, wicked alicorns came down from on high to do battle for the cities of the plain, and smote many a pony. They laid a terrible curse on all ponykind, one not lifted until recently by a beautiful Queen. The revised official historical narratives might take some time getting familiar with, but we're sure the ponies will manage. And what better way to test that knowledge than through a game show?"
MAN_beginning_2d:0 "The Economic Frontier"
MAN_beginning_2d_desc:0 "Changeling economics is based on Changeling culture and lifestyle, but these things have gone straight out the window in the territories. All the territories are experimenting, and Manehattan is no exception."
UNUSED:0 "MO-oPS R&D Division"
UNUSED_desc:0 "Hypothetically, if we *could* read your brain (which we can't) we of course wouldn't find anything incriminating. Right? Of course not. We're all friends here.

MAN_beginning_2g:0 "Hearts and Minds"
MAN_beginning_2g_desc:0 "Lysia thinks of herself as a Changeling of the people. Ponies. Whatever. Perhaps making the ponies fear us less will result in a more malleable populace to govern. We'll test this concept out with "Hug a Changeling" day."
MAN_beginning_2h:0 "Indoctrination Program"
MAN_beginning_2h_desc:0 "How much of the indoctrination's success is real, and how much of it is a cyncial fakery to get through the day? And does it even matter? Who knows! Praise Chrysalis."
MAN_beginning_2i:0 "Character Assassination"
MAN_beginning_2i_desc:0 "For too long the ponies have seen their Princess as some godly being who wished to do only good! We must reveal her for what she truly is! A despot who would crush all dissent by making people believe she was a god above all mortal harm. Well. Our armies proved that wrong. But as long as ponies revere the memory of Celestia and her rule, they'll always be unhappy under our yoke. Let's change the narrative a bit."
MAN_beginning_2j:0 "Instate Military Law"
MAN_beginning_2j_desc:0 "While martial law in some form has been the norm in Manehattan for as long as we've been here, it is only now that we have codified it into a more reasonable and sustainable form. Just as well, because we're going to have to set a whole lot of new legal precedents for a prickly court case."
MAN_beginning_2k:0 "Conscript the Scientists"
MAN_beginning_2k_desc:0 "A scientist is a soldier in the army of progress! Terrible slogan, but also exactly what our new programs believe. The old eggheads are the new R&D, and we've provided swanky living and clean labs for a lifetime."
MAN_beginning_4e:0 "Amp Up Military Production"
MAN_beginning_4e_desc:0 "To build up a larger force drawn from Changeling settlers and pony collaborators means more guns. We need to ramp up production in order to supply ourselves, but also to be an arsenal for all of the hives if need be. Protectress Lysia believes that an inspection of collaborator-run military factories is in order to make sure our quotas are being fulfilled."

MAN_beginning_4f:0 "The Inkognito-Division"
MAN_beginning_4f_desc:0 "The best and/or worst thing about Changelings is their ability to be anything, anyone, and anywhere. They are natural infiltrators, and even more natural sabatouers and spies. This preternatural ability served us well in the war, and shall serve us well in our victory. Commander Soryn, who in the war had led one of our best infiltrator divisions, has come to share with us her expertise - and she's bringing her boys along too."
MAN_beginning_5a:0 "Break their Codes"
MAN_beginning_5a_desc:0 "Even as we firmly deny the existence of the E.L.F., we have struggled to break their airtight security for far too long. We must make progress. Recent inroads in the military application of cryptology has allowed us to detect and interpret coded ELF radio transmissions. It is time to see if our intel is correct."
MAN_beginning_5b:0 "The Spyeye Program"
MAN_beginning_5b_desc:0 "In true Changeling fashion, we have created the next evolution in state surveillance. The concept of an all-seeing, omniscient security apparatus is truly the best idea we could have ever asked for, and we did in fact explicitly ask for it. Smile for the camera."
MAN_beginning_5c:0 "The Resistance is Us"
MAN_beginning_5c_desc:0 "It is time to activate our deepest agent in the resistance. He is in so deep, in fact, that we have lost contact with him, but we retain the secret protocols that will bring him out of his guise.

ELF_right_1_b:0 "Weapons for the Revolution"
ELF_right_1_b_desc:0 "We have weapons for now, but the brutal war that is to come will require more. We must turn every factory and every workshop we can to arming our forces as quickly as we can, lest the changeling war machine crushes us under its sheer weight."

ELF_left_1_a:0 "Unity at All Costs"
ELF_left_1_a_desc:0 "We stand together, or we fall one by one. We have to address grievances when they arise at once, or simply demand that both parties put their differences aside. May Twilight Sparkle's lessons not fail us here, for without this trust and respect we may well end up faltering."

ELF_left_3_a:0 "Don't Forget Democracy"
ELF_left_3_a_desc:0 "Princess Trixie Lulamoon and Princess Starlight Glimmer does have a certain ring to it to many, but neither Trixie nor Starlight has entertained this notion.

ELF_left_3_b:0 "Freedom for the Liberated"
ELF_left_3_b_desc:0 "As we push forward, we don't want to leave just military garrisons in our wake. We know Equestria will be reborn, and the sooner the better, so let's dedicate some of our efforts to make sure that civil authority can be restored in the reclaimed homeland as soon as possible."
ELF_left_4_a:0 "Call On the Diaspora"
ELF_left_4_a_desc:0 "When Equestria fell, the fortunate managed to flee abroad, and they have watched their homeland be ravaged by the Changelings ever since. They haven't magically stopped being Equestrians though, and tens of thousands of those refugees are eager to rally to our cause, many times bringing friends or their new families with them as well."
ELF_left_4_b:0 "Revive Equestrian Institutions"
ELF_left_4_b_desc:0 "So many things were lost during the invasion, and the Equestria that arises after the war could well be unrecognizeable if we don't take care to preserve those things. Equestria will be reborn, and we will make sure that for all the things that have changed, there will be things that remain the same as well."
ELF_left_final:0 "A Free Government"
ELF_left_final_desc:0 "One of the key things about the old Equestria was freddom. Ponies were free to live their lives, find their careers and purposes, express the ideas they had and criticize the powerful without risking retribution. These values will not be forgotten even after this brutal conflict, and Liberty, Friendship and Harmony shall be our guiding principles, now and forever."
ELF_middle_0:0 "Rally the Everfree"
ELF_middle_0_desc:0 "The Everfree Forest was a hotbed of resistance activity from the beginning of the invasion, and though there's still rebel activity in the forest, the various factions of the Everfree are scattered and divided. Yet, if we can convince them to join us we will be blessed with cadres of the most elite resistance fighters in all of Equestria."
ELF_middle_1:0 "Trust in the Duumvirs"
ELF_middle_1_desc:0 "Neither Starlight Glimmer nor Trixie Lulamoon is the kind of pony that the average Equestrian would have expected to lead this uprising, and yet they have risen to the call more than anypony else. They have sworn a solemn oath to restore Equestria, and the ELF has to put its trust in their sincerity."
ELF_middle_2:0 "Return of the Princess"
ELF_middle_2_desc:0 "Twilight Sparkle is the ordained successor of Celesetia and Luna, this has been known for a long time. Now, in this age of strife, to have the Princess of Friendship back is a boon to Equestria like few others. Equestria isn't the same without its Alicorn rulers, and ponies are waiting with bated breath for the coronation." 
ELF_middle_3_a:0 "A Noble Cause"
ELF_middle_3_a_desc:0 "A surprising figure from the past has shown up in Equestria recently. Prince Blueblood, former Field Marshal of the Equestrian Armed Forces, has contacted the E.L.F. to offer his services. Some are hesitant to accept the offer, blaming the fall of Equestria on him, but Starlight and Trixie knows what it's like to make amends."
ELF_middle_3_b:0 "The Magic of Friendship"
ELF_middle_3_b_desc:0 "Even after all the horrors of war and the countless challenges faced by Equestria, it is still a nation where the bonds between creatures, be they family, friends or whatever else, are highly valued. The war has not changed it, instead it has only reinforced the need to keep those bonds alive."
ELF_middle_4:0 "Equestria Reclaimed"

Though she was feared dead, she was in the end sprung from captivity during the war of liberation. With Celestia and Luna both abdicating, they entrusted her with their powers and gave their blessings as she was elevated to the throne as the Princess of Harmony.\n\nWhatever Celestia saw in her protegé has been put on full display for Equestria. The democratic structures that arose during the war have been affirmed and Equestria's political stage opened up. She has worked tirelessly to elevated the ponies of Equestria from being subjects and making them her co-rulers via the ballot and the parliament. With tireless effort, unequalled rigor and meticulousness and deep humility as well as the blessing of her now departed predecessor, Twilight Sparkle has set out to be a new kind of princess for a new age, one that can walk among her people and who elevates them instead of towering above them.§!"

The war was horrifying and costly, and now it has ended in defeat. The whole of Equestria rocks back on its heels.\n\nThe victorious but over-extended changelings begin carving up their new territories into governates and protectorates, hoping to organize a new government swiftly before the malaise can become resentment. The Queendom is expanding, but for the moment, Chrysalis has extended to the breaking point of her reach.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBy Royal Charter of Her Majesty Queen Chrysalis, we have decided to create a new administrative entity centred around the city of Manehattan.\n\nFor this tremendous responsibility, the Queen has chosen a bug named Lysia, who, despite scoring high in her class at our military academies, has been relegated to administrative work for a long time, albeit on the Queen's General Staff. Such prior experience shall serve her well, though, as she will be given command over the Protectorate to be established in that region.\n\nManehattan's new 'Protectress' has few resources, fewer allies, and the meanest city in all of Equestria to tame.

This eruption of seditious activity on such a large scale is alleged to be the first coordinated effort by the so-called "Harmonic Resistance" active on the eastern Equestrian seaboard. Hitherto unsubstantiated reports coming from sources in the Changeling administration allege that the "Harmonic Resistance" is in fact led by none other than the ponies known as "Starlight Glimmer" and "Trixie Lulamoon" - the former the progenitor of the failed ideology dubbed "Equalism", and the latter a washed-out street magician.

Most importantly, the fact that we were still able, unprepared as we had been, to put down the unrest meant that the legitimacy of our governance over the Protectorate was still uncontested thus far.\n\nWe may have weathered the storm today, but the reports of our infiltrator agents in the field point towards a rising trend in anti-Changeling, pro-Harmonic, and secessionist thought amongst the general population of the Protectorate. Similar waves of unrest akin to what happened in the [MAN_uprising_in_state_event_target.GetName] region are certainties that we are sure to experience in the coming months.\n\nWe must stand against the tide and protect the Motherland from the pony rabble that would seek to destroy the hard-earned fruits of our conquest."

The assessment of the extent of the damage caused to our administration is still in process, but it is undeniable that on a local level, the legitimacy of the Changeling mandate over the [MAN.GetName] has been dealt a severe blow by our failure to put down the unrest.\n\nIn post-unrest [MAN_uprising_in_state_event_target.GetName], it is being reported that civilian ponies are flaunting the 9p.m. curfew with impunity, the local Collaborationists are facing regular harassment and intimidation, petty offenses against the Changeling garrison has increased dozenfold, and, most terrifyingly, from the reports of our infiltrator agents in the field, anti-Changeling, pro-Harmonic, and secessionist sentiments have experienced exponential, uninhibited growth.\n\nIn essence, Changeling authority over the [MAN_uprising_in_state_event_target.GetName] region has been crippled.

MAN_ELF.2.d:0 "The time has come to begin entrenching our control over our protectorate, and we have much to do. A first step is to acquire a base of operations that can support the undertaking of control over the great city of Manehattan. To that end, we have enlisted 84 Crystal Avenue to serve as our "nexus". Built during an economic boom during the recent era of prosperity in Equestria before our great war of conquest, it will serve us well in the times to come.\n\nOnce a proud symbol of Equestrian achievement, the tower now bustles with busy changelings. Orderlies carry stacks of paper past bored guards, their guns firmly in their grasp. Dignitaries visiting from Vesalipolis and engineers from Vraks on tours pass pony workers with downcast eyes and careful steps.\n\nEquestria is over. The Protectorate of Manehattan is now.\n\nThe city's new ruling Protectress is one Lysia, newly minted from the hive military academies. While universally acknowledged as intelligent and capable, she is extremely displeased with her assignment and anyone who has seen her knows it.\n\nA small party of well-dressed ponies arrive asking for an audience with the new Protectress, and she is about to pass them off to an orderly when they offer something naive yet interesting. Leading citizens, businessponies, and former civil servants have banded together to offer their services to the new regime. Her advisors scoff at the idea of pony collaborators, but Lysia treats them with a touch less derision, wondering if they might not be useful in the short term.\n\nThere is but one issue...\n\nAnd it is, of course, the ponies. The few allies we have made since our occupation began are all clamoring to work in this building, and some are even asking to live here!? Some in Lysia's staff are clamoring for the administration of the Protectorate to be a solely Changeling venture. Of course, everything in the building will be highly classified, and so it would be a severe risk to allow them to live there. But it could allow us to make nice with a few more locals."

But there are a few weaknesses obvious to any more experienced observers. The garrison is lighter-equipped than it should be, and supply lines are over-burdened with the task of establishing control over such a vast prize as Equestria.

Protectress Lysia may not be thrilled to rot away behind a desk in Manehattan, but she's not an idiot. If she doesn't shape this city and the surrounding towns into shape, this house of cards is falling on her head specifically. So! Rebuilding it is.\n\nOne proposal is the rebuilding of the famous Bronclyn bridge in Manehattan that took a severe battering when the victorious Changeling army occupied the city. On this issue two competing factions vie for supremacy; our more ardent militarists call for the demolition of what remains of the old bridge in favour of a wholly new edifice, built in the Changeling architectural tradition as an ode to our victory. The moderate (and perhaps more sensible) faction wishes to limit the construction work to a conservative restoration of the bridge to its original pre-war appearance.\n\nLysia needs to give the ponies and what not of Manehattan fewer reasons to fight back. Inviting the Collaborators into government has helped with this, as have curbing some of the behavior of her officers. But rebuilding the famous Bronclyn bridge is sure to make even the more resentful little equinoids pause when considering rebellion. The bridge will also signal a return to business as usual, with access to the city restored to the outside world. We can only hope that with the rebuilding, that this great metropolis on the frontiers of the Hegemony will be peaceful soon."

Foremost of said issues is the crowded urban environment and restive slums of the city.\n\nQueen Chrysalis has dispatched settlers across the continent, and after pulling a few strings, Protectress Lysia has secured a few thousand settlers for Manehattan. Entailingly, she has initiated plans to redevelop the inner city, clearing out the slums and creating new neighbourhoods for Changeling settlement and industrial development.\n\nUnfortunately, this does mean that we'll have to expend some resources and time preparing living space for them. Some old tenement buildings and decrepit corner stores are going to be razed to make way for sensible, sturdy Changeling-style hive-blocks.\n\nThe plan, though suitably ambitious, seems highly unfeasible at the moment. With our garrison overstretched and wholly incapable of pacifying dissent and unrest in Equestria's largest city, some of our officers have suggested enlisting the help of the pony collaborationists in our attempt to remake the city in our own image."

And they couldn't let that happen. They could now only hope for whatever their commanding officer had planned to succeed.\n\nGeneral Vesper, Special Operative of the Protectorate Security Division. It was him that the soldiers were trusting with the plan to conquer the building, and so he had to put everything he could into not letting them know that in fact, he really had no idea what to do either. He had simply told them to keep observing and wait. He figured that, once inside, he would come up with something resembling a plan, somehow, eventually.\n\nAs the dissident ponies gathered within the building, one who seemed to be their leader stepped onto the make-shift podium against the wall of the broken building and began to speak...\n\n"Hello fellow members of the Resistance!"\n\n"Tonight we have gathered to plot our greatest action yet against the buggers who wish to hold us down."\n\nThere is murmured acceptance from the crowd.\n\n"Now this plan is only known to a few of you here, of course, and has been in the works for a long time.

The pony began cackling and almost dropped from the podium itself.\n\nWhen the figure regained his composure he stood up, straightened his jacket, and spoke once more - "Eh, screw it, the jig's up!", and with that he cackled again as a ghastly green fire enveloped him. In place of the pony Resistance member was instead a grizzled-looking Changeling - a fate shared by many of the Resistance members of the audience. Caught completely off guard, the gathered Resistance broke under the chaotic onslaught of the Changeling operatives in their midst. The exits from the building had all been secured by undercover Changeling infiltrators who subdued anypony trying to flee, and in ferocious room-to-room fighting, squads of jaegers in gas masks wiped out the last Resistance holdouts in the basement and upper floors through the liberal use of tear gas.

But finally being recognized as the true talent he was, not some fossil past his prime was too good a chance to pass up.\n\nHe came to a stop at a lectern, draped with the flags off both the Ost-Kommando and the Order. 'The only proper audience’ Wind Rider thought as he looked down on the audience consisting purely of pegasi, each and everyone in a more civilian version of the uniform that the paratroopers were wearing. He looked down, adjusting the medals he wore on his own leather uniform, the medals that the bitch to Spitfire had ripped off him.\n\n"Children of Hurricane! We stand now again as real pegasi. Not those that allowed the mudponies and hornheads to trample over them while they rejected their own supremacy. Recovery towards a population of true pegasi begins with us. But now is not the time to ask how we came to this. That can wait until later, when the pegasi of the region and then the world have learned of their true destiny. The destiny as a loyal soldier, loyal to their unit and to their race.\n\nThe pegasi of today are the most fortunate of those since Commander Hurricane. They get to know their real destiny and to take to part in the most noble of causes and crusades. When the other ponies learn their place, they will get to know the true caste system of the world. The smart, the changelings, will rule. The strong and the brave, we the pegasi shall defend and command. And those below us. The mudponies and the hornheads will work and be the labor force that is below us, like in the old days, where we, the pegasi protected them and in return, they provided us with food and luxuries as it should be.\n\nThe ponies who have voluntarily joined this impending restructuring of society, or those who will join it, have to decide if they will participate with all their hearts and minds or if they will resist it. That will not change what will happen. You can be sure, that once the resistance has rooted out of the sewers, they will not allow the old Equestria to come back. If even the Alicorns with all their power and might could not, then all the mudponies cannot either. If you have understood recent history, you will know that it is not possible either.\n\nNow, pegasi and children of the new order, arise and bring forth the storm!\n\nWind Rider stepped back and listened to the stamps in the ground from the pegasi on the ground.

Before him stood hundreds if not thousands of pegasi, and as he stepped up to the podium it was with a thrill going through him. \n\n“Greetings, pegasi of East Equestria,” he said, remembering to fire of a smirk for the cameras. “What a day, right? I know that a lot of ponies would prefer to go on about how we’d never achieve anything else, much like how a lot of pegasi went on about how we were lessened as a people after Heart’s Warming. After all, weren’t we reduced when the three tribes became one? Weren’t we left at the mercy of other, more simpering ponies who didn’t acknowledge our ancient traditions?  The fact of the matter is simple when you strip away all the nonsense. We are pegasi, and we are born warriors. It was what Commander Hurricane led us to be, and it was what Flash Magnus was when he showed the world the true mettle of a pegasus.\n\nI am not going to deny that there’s pegasi out there who claim that apparently it is our duty to fight the changelings, resist to the bitter end and all. I wonder what those pegasi would say when Flash Magnus asked us why we remain managing the weather for entitled mudcrawlers, or why Commander Hurricane asked what happened to the martial pride of our people. Isn’t it strange that all these ancient heroes seem to have just… died out when we united with the other tribes? Maybe, or maybe it makes perfect sense. \n\nPegasi of East Equestria, you’re here because I see in you the ability to restore our old pride. We can become the Pegasi we were once again, cut free from the fetters of the earth. So what will it be? Will you coddle these mudcrawlers or are you going to remember what you are?

Interestingly enough, these same neighbourhoods showed a sharp decline in noncompliance and resistance from the residents. Further investigation revealed that valerian is likely inducing many potential troublemakers into a state of calm and reduced stress.\n\nIn an unorthodox move, the local chief of police has launched an initiative to legitimatise the market by supporting the efforts of the criminals. Our goal would be to 'sling' as much of the drug within the pony residents of Manehattan.

The letter concludes with a thinly-veiled threat against any sort of separatism on the part of Lysia's regime.\n\nIt is clear that our overlords back home will not dare to intervene directly, militarily or otherwise, in the affairs of the [MAN.GetName].

Her gamble had paid off; when push came to shove, her titular overlords in distant Vesalipolis had backed down. The Ost-Kommando had never been able to rely on the central government for much help, so they had always had to go it alone. Manehattan has thusly earned its autonomy through hard work and determination, Lysia reasoned as she left the meeting room. On second thought, that sentiment had seemed a bit simplistic, and besides, a higher degree of autonomy alone would hardly be the answer to the turbulent mess that was the Protectorate of Manehattan.\n\nBut still! A small victory is a victory nonetheless, and such triumphs are few and far between in the nerve-wracking grind that is the governance of the East Coast.

From Manehattan, they had boarded an armoured train which took them along the coastline, making good time to the industrialised city of Albion. Greeted by officers from the local section of the Manehattan Office of Public Safety, the entourage had taken a night to map out the surroundings, counter-referencing their research with their intelligence on the history and possible fate of the Morning Walker, gleaned from the interrogations of captured Equestrian military officials.\n\nA Vanhoover-Class battleship, the Morning Walker, as far as seized Equestrian military records indicate, was only three-quarters complete by the time the Changeling advance threatened its home port, causing it to flee north, semi-finished with a skeleton crew, where it foundered off the coast of Albion following some obscure shipboard accident. The Ost-Kommando's review of the official narrative and the subsequent skepticism towards its truthfulness led to an investigation of the battleship's true fate; if rediscovered and captured on the Ost-Kommando's own initiative, not only would the Morning Walker grant the Protectorate significant naval power, but also prove to the Hegemony that Lysia's administration was capable of providing for itself - not that Vesalipolis had ever done much to support the Protectorate either.\n\nLysia was tired, her uniform stained and muddied from the hours of continuous trekking, bushwacking through the dense undergrowth and clambering over rocky hillsides. Her muscles burned, her meticulously-groomed appearance had gradually come undone, and yet it was the most alive she'd felt for months. The sun was quickly sinking beyond the horizon as they approached a patch of flat ground bordering a small inlet, at the end of which were cliffs leading to the sea.\n\nIt was at the fringes of the grassland, where another step further would have sent her plummeting into the wave-beaten rocks, that Lysia's order to make camp was strangled in her throat, as she realised that the leafy boughs swinging from side to side beyond the cliff's edge were not trees on the opposing cliffsides, but rather, the vine-covered lattice masts of a great battleship - the Morning Walker - snugly moored inside the inlet.\n\nThe next morning, as the reinforcements she had radioed in from Albion were getting the ship seaworthy for its voyage to Manehattan, Lysia sat up outside her tent and enjoyed the sunrise over the ocean."

Well-connected with the scrawny but highly advanced military-industrial complex under the Diarchy, the scientists were eventually persuaded to impart to us their knowledge of Equestrian weapon systems development. Most interesting amongst the findings from the report is the indication of the existence of a yet-unnamed military R&D project, the only details of which thus far hint at a weapon of great tactical importance."

MAN_ELF.72.t:0 "Changeling Dispatches - Patrolling the Everfree"
MAN_ELF.72.d:0 "Beyond the outskirts of Ponyville lies the Everfree Forest. Densely packed with ancient, gnarled trees hundreds of years old, in many places the undergrowth is nigh-impenetrable, leaving travellers only with the few paths through the forest that somehow manage to stay clear of foliage. The deeper one plunges into its depths, the more otherworldly the forest seems as civilisation recedes; the sun fails to pierce the opaque canopies, the treeroots on the forest floor grow so contorted it is hard not to trip, and the flora becomes so exotic and wild to be undomesticable even through earth pony magic. The shadows become thick and foreboding, and the pervading gloom makes it hard to see past a few metres. One can easily imagine getting lost in the murk, doomed to wander the forest until the end of time.\n\nNo wonder, then, that Zecora's Everfree Resistance had managed to survive as long as it did within. Not so long ago, their bloody and short-lived insurrection had surged to encompass the surrounding towns, threatening Canterlot before being forced back into the forest from whence they came. But the Everfree Resistance seemed to have an unnatural affinity with the woods of their namesake, and the Changeling divisions bled ten times as heavily clearing the forest as they did its surrounds.\n\nBut with the brute force of sheer firepower, they had managed. They burnt the trees until there were none left for the ponies to hide behind. Artillery barrages cut swathes through the undergrowth. And they had deployed so many tons of defoliant that even the Everfree began to sag under the poisonous onslaught. As the forest burned, Zecora's insurrection withered away until there was nothing left.\n\nAt least, this was the official narrative. But patrols through the forest still went missing from time to time, and already the Everfree was recovering rapidly from the damage wrought by the Changeling invasion. To be sent to this particular frontier was tantamount to a penal assignment, and everypony knew it.\n\nThis did not explain why Ocellus, a fully-fledged corps commander qualified to lead entire divisions into battle, was now trekking through the mud, leading a column of Changelings through the Everfree. It was supposed to raise morale, Lysia had said. Her aunt's apologetic demeanor suggested otherwise, implying, with a thinly-veiled rage, that higher powers in Vesalipolis had a hoof in her newest assignment.\n\nWas she merely a pawn in Lysia's power plays, then? Perhaps her assignment to such a dangerous posting was designed to punish her aunt for some esoteric transgression against the elites in Vesalipolis.\n\nFor now, it didn't matter. The front of the column has paused at some unseen obstacle. Ocellus glimpses shadowy figures flitting from tree to tree, and the murky depths of the forest begin to shift with the movements of creatures unknown. Behind her, there is an unfolding of blades as her troops affix bayonets. Ocellus pauses, and tries to gauge the nature of their soon-to-be assailants."

Ocellus wonders how the Everfree Resistance managed to keep them at bay.\n\nBut fierce as they are, the timberwolves are no match for the heavy machine-guns the column deploy, and in an instant those at the forefront are torn apart by unrelenting volleys of gunfire, shredded into clouds of wood splinters and bad vibes. Ocellus directs her column's fire onto the charging timberwolves with unwavering precision, until the creatures are all dead or routed."

But by then half their number are already dead or wounded, and the remnants of the column are beset on all sides by the Everfree Resistance, of which Ocellus can only make out faint blurs as the partisans flit from tree to tree.\n\nShe picks out a partisan gunner on a treetop, half-hidden by a curtain of vines, and shoots. Past her smoking pistol she makes out the corpse of her unlucky target, falling to the ground. But there are too many of them, and the forest is the ponies' domain. They make a brave last stand at the base of a great oak tree, and their final remnants are at last cut down where they stand by unseen pony snipers.\n\nOcellus, somehow, evades the pony partisans who are butchering her soldiers, and flees into the depths of the Everfree."

It was supposed to be just a publicity bit, showing the troops that their leaders understood the view from below. But the partisans of the Everfree Resistance had hit hard them in the woods, and after bullets had sliced through her wings she had tumbled down into this ravine. And then the timberwolves came.\n\nThis one had been unlucky. When she'd killed one of its companions with a few well placed shots, the rest had fallen back, and this lone creature had lost its footing. Now it was hungry, and its presence was keeping her trapped here more surely than her broken wings.\n\nShe tried scaring it, and then ignoring it, and lastly, out of a kind of lonely grace, she offered the creature some of her rations.\n\nWhen the reinforcements finally found her two days later, that wolf was already hers."

Give them a cause or a warm, happy memory and they'll cling to it until the bitter end.\n\nIn this case, deliverance from the Changeling jackboot comes in the form of their unassailable Princess-Mother, her chaste, maternal demeanor and the profundity of her mystical powers combined in a paragon of Equestrian divinity — the pinnacle of everything a pony wants to become. That the sun still rises and sets without her guidance is immaterial to the ponies' worship of the Solar Goddess, which, if anything, has intensified under the new Changeling regime.\n\nSo long as they remember her, Celestia's very memory and existence will certainly continue to motivate them to insubordination and in time, open revolt. Lysia's new initiatives to 'educate' the populace about their old leaders' many faults may not always be factual, and the process of indoctrination will require much time and effort, but she has no doubt that it will be beneficial to the legitimacy of the new regime with time.\n\nManehattan's schools now teach young foals and changelings about Celestia the tyrant, greedy, stubborn, and myopic, a lazy delegator who pursued luxury whilst other ponies did all the work.

It was something fringe republican movements had been complaining about for ages. We could use this to paint Celestia as a power-hungry tyrant who suppressed dissenters to preserve her autocratic rule.\n\nThere is, of course, another option. Equestria under the Diarchs was notably pacifistic, resulting in a weak military using outdated technology, something analysts often point to as one of the major causes for Equestria's defeat in the Great War. We could attack Celestia on her peaceful ways, describing them as cowardice that left the ponies undefended and helpless, while implying the Changelings' superior military would defend them from harm.\n\nHowever, some of Lysia's aides believe Celestia's reputation to be pristine to the point that any attempt to tarnish it would backfire, and have instead suggested dropping the initiative as quietly as possible with the hope that nobody will notice."

Although the group is made up of renowned industrialists, owners of private banks and otherwise unbelievably rich ponies, they all seem dazzled by the luxury on display.

The encircled ponies readied their rifles and prepared to make a grim last stand around Hoofdrich's Shrine.\n\nAt least, this was how things were supposed to go. Instead, the few companies of Changeling soldiers around the park found themselves surrounded by massive crowds of restive ponies, drawn there by the news of an impending massacre of Resistance. The armoured reinforcements never arrived because the Maneway rails had been sabotaged overnight, and the collaborationists, upon seeing the swelling and increasingly angry masses of Manehattanites who had shown up in opposition, simply melted away.\n\nThe situation is quickly getting out of hoof as Fillydelphia and Albion convulse in sympathy riots, and if Manehattan is not pacified soon the rest of the Harmonic Resistance may well decide to further escalate the situation. Masked rioters battle with Constabulary and Changeling soldiers all over the city, and the population grows more restless by the minute.

Many local Manehattians watched in amusement as a group of the new arrivals bathed in the bay's waters. When asked why they had done so, a drone replied: "Back home, outdoors bathing is unthinkable. There's something about diving into a large pool of water, and a bathtub just doesn't cut it."\n\nAnother drone was impressed at the efficiency of the Weather Service and applauded the climate. "Sunny skies, warm weather, and just an overall great place to be in," she said, adding jokingly that their old homes could make use of similar services. "There are a lot of bugs back home who are more than a little stir-crazy. They could do with importing the weather from these nice pegasi."\n\nThe immigrants are quickly integrating according to official reports, and are expected to provide a significant boost to local production in almost every sector."

MAN_ELF.104.d:0 "The Ost-Kommando is many things - for one, certain apparatchiks in Vesalipolis are quite keen on portraying Lysia's cadres as disloyal and scheming - but no one can accuse them of incompetence or a lack of ambition. Lysia's military administration has spent many months consolidating their grasp over the Protectorate, battling the Harmonic Resistance, and building up a network of changeling-loyal pony collaborators. The efforts of the Lady Protectress have culminated now in her proclamation of the Dominion of Eastern Equestria, in a move that is simultaneously set to strengthen her control over her demesne whilst distancing herself from the oversight of Vesalipolis.\n\nSo far from the Changeling homeland, yet controlling the resources and infrastructure of Equestria's most well-developed regions - namely, the crown jewel of Manehattan - the Protectorate, with its unique geopolitical position, is perhaps the most well-placed of all the Changeling puppet states to have attempted Lysia's act of decentralisation and federation. Where the Protectorate was formerly made up of military governorates overseen by Changeling commanders, the suppressing of organised pony resistance and a sufficiently-developed collaborationist establishment has allowed for a devolution of power from the Ost-Kommando's headquarters in Manehattan. Civilian control was resumed over industries and services formerly placed under military jurisdiction, with the Constabulary taking over security duties from the Garrison.\n\nSpeaking in an address to the newly-formed Federation, Lysia emphasised the new regime's continued loyalty to Queen Chrysalis as the first Dominion of the Changeling Hegemony, whilst reminding the ponies - no longer subjects of a military government - of their new role as citizens of the Federation, and the opportunities that lie therein."

The general poured over the candies with a suspicious look on his face before he fished one of them off the plate and bit down on it. The suspicion was traded for surprise and then approval.\n\n"Interesting!" he exclaimed. "And to think that I've never seen anything like this before. How did this come to be?"\n\n"It is just one of the many treasures of Manehattan," Lysia smiled, leaning back to sip her wine. "It is something you learn over time: Manehattan is a marvellous place that holds potential that I do not think one can even find back in the old country. Just these little trifles," she said, picking up one of the Lovebites and biting down on it. "I am such a glutton for them, but that's what we do here in Manehattan. We take the best and elevate it. We make something new. We don't settle for what we are at the moment, but we know that we can do better, if we reconsider things.\n\n"I see..." the general answered quietly. "I must say miss Lysia, you have done a terrific job in Manehattan, and I have friends that would probably be very interested in vacationing here as well.

Most prominent amongst the ships on display were the two newest additions to Manehattan's fledging navy - the Großstadt Manehattan and the Dame Protektorin.\n\nBoth former warships belonging to the Celestial Sea Fleet, they had been lost during the Great War; the former holed below the waterline by a changeling torpedo bomber and subsequently run ashore by her crew, and the latter scuttled at its moorings as Manehattan fell. Belonging to the Canterlot class of Equestrian battleships, both vessels are considered antiquated relative to contemporary designs, but the proximity of their wrecks to the megalopolis and the relative ease of recovery which this entailed made them the target of the Ost-Kommando's naval reclamation efforts.\n\nWith a startling efficiency the Großstadt Manehattan had been towed from its resting place on the shore to the dockyards of Manehattan, where it had been repaired, refitted, and recrewed, to sail the oceans once more under the flag of the Changeling Hegemony. On the other hoof, the Dame Protektorin was returned to its drydock immediately after the naval review, where work on renovating its armament and superstructure continued; a barren hulk still algae-coated and battered from being refloated scant days ago, it had barely managed to stay afloat during the naval review.\n\nAs symbols of bygone Equestrian naval might, the resurrection of these two battleships call into question the aspirations of Manehattan's Changeling administration."

The shimmering filth that emerges from the smokestacks come in all the colours of the rainbow, rising above the landscape to blot out the sun. The pinnacles of the skyscraper-factories rival those of Canterlot in their ambition to pierce the heavens, shrouding in shadow the abject misery of the labour camps and sweatshops below.\n\nEven after nightfall, long past twilight, the foundries where magic is caged and remoulded with such brutal efficiency continue on with their ceaseless activity, their wan emanations lighting up the night sky with the glow of an eternal sunset."

Having served in the Equestrian Royal Navy during the Great War, the sailor-turned-pirate has now been confirmed to be working with the Harmonic Resistance, attacking Changeling shipping off the Equestrian East Coast.\n\nRecent naval reforms undertaken by the Changeling military administration of the Manehattan Protectorate would prove to be the downfall of this notorious pirate. Recently outfitted with steel belt armour, the Terpsichoria was able to withstand the opening salvo from the attacking skiffs, and through skillful use of its shipboard ordnance, was able to sink or disable at least three pirate vessels, routing the remainder. In a devious boarding action undertaken by the Terpsichoria's small complement of jaegers, Turquoise Breeze was captured alive aboard the wreckage of his flagship and taken into Changeling custody, along with an operative of the Harmonic Resistance.\n\nSpeaking to the press, the Chief of Navy of the [MAN.GetName], [MAN_scripted_loc_for_chief_of_navy], proclaimed the demise of piracy in Manehattanite waters, and reiterated the Changeling administration's commitment to combatting the Harmonic Resistance's illegal activities, wherever they may be."

Unannounced by the mainstream opposition groups and seemingly unnoticed by the Changeling administration's network of collaborationist informants, the spontaneous protest had, in a rare outmaneuvering of Lysia's MO-oPS, succeeded in catching the Garrison's security apparatus completely off guard. Because the Constabulary is as ineffecient as ever, we have had to rely on our own infiltrators, performing impromptu transformations into random passersby as a consequence of their rushed deployment, to gather intelligence on this sudden outpouring of unrest.\n\nWithin the ranks of the dissenters, their purpose becomes readily evident: they have occupied the construction sites around the structs of the Bronclyn Bridge, damaging and sabotaging equipment in an apparent bid to stymie our reconstruction efforts. The destruction is chaotic and unorganised, and there is some conflict between differing factions within the dissidents as to their methodology, but the damage already being done is significant - a strain on our finances and resources, and another blow to the legitimacy of Changeling rule overe the East Coast.\n\nThe flurry of activity within the Crystaller Building, provoked by the nasty shock of the Harmonic Resistance's sudden strike, is frenetic and tinged with hysteria. It did not help that the collaborationist staff were especially susceptible to the panic, on account of them being ponies.\n\nAcross the city, the local changeling commander stationed at the Bronclyn Bridge has his own plans, as the occupation of the Square entered into its third hour. On his own initiative, in an excellent embodiment of the Changeling military tradition which emphasises snap decisionmaking and mission-type tactics, the company of soldiers under his command took up positions within the buildings surrounding the Mare-de-Sun Square Garden, and began firing volleys of tear-gas to disperse the rabble. The speediness and shock of the changeling response broke the resolve of the ponies and sent them all running, in a surprising and complete rout.\n\nUpon hearing the news, the Ost-Kommando amassed before the doors of Lysia's bedroom all breathe out a collective sigh of relief. The Lady Protectress was having her daily nap, and everyling knew how worked up she could get if she got woken up, especially to deal with random crises."

Every surface seems covered in barbed wire, fearsome anti-air cannons are mounted on the guard towers, and there are rumours that Diamond Dog jailors have been brought over from Griffonia to bolster the prison's defences.\n\nAll these preventative measures designed to counter a breakout, fearsome as they are, now seem trifling in the face of the Harmonic Resistance's most audacious feat of defiance yet - a direct assault on the Penitentiary, to rescue their commander Firefly from the bowels of the prison. A series of well-placed explosions brought down the fortified front gates and disabled the turrets on the guard towers, after which pony partisans stormed the prison, surprising the guards and taking control over most of the facility.\n\nThe surviving guards are now barricaded within a secure section of the facility with access to a pier, from which reinforcements can be inserted. A company of jaegers, backed up by a platoon or so of Constabulary officers, are now ready to reenter the Penitentiary to disrupt the Resistance operation. Firefly's cell has been blown open, and the renegade commander with his coterie of partisans are fighting his way out of a cordon of changeling guards as we speak.\n\nThe Harmonic Resistance rearguard defending the approaches to the prison may have had the element of surprise at first, but they are lightly-armed and will not stand up to a concerted push; whilst their commander may escape, we can make sure that it will cost the ponies dearly.

From the suburbs of Manehattan, the shadowy woods of Hollow Shades, and the inland cities of Detrot and Stratusburg, the Equestrian Liberation Front rises up in open revolt.\n\nUnable or unwilling to navigate the vastness of the Celestial Sea, and perhaps put off partly by the constant belligerence of our griffon neighbours, Queen Chrysalis has thus far spared the [EQC.GetName] from Changeling expansionism, seemingly content to gorge herself on the riches of Equestria.\n\nWhether the [EQC.GetName] plans on partaking in the Equestrian liberatory endeavour remains to be seen.

MAN_ELF_new.33727.d:0 "Our conquest of Equestria, though wildly successful, remains incomplete. Our armies, though experienced, are yet inadequate for the task of pacifying the occupied territories. The consequences of our overstretched garrisons are set to be the most dire in the territories of the East Coast of Equestria, far away from the influence of Vesalipolis. A semi-autonomous Protectorate, centered on the metropolis of Manehattan, must be formed as quickly as possible in order to pacify the unrest brewing in the East.\n\nOur divisions, experienced and battle-hardened as they are, will still be able to maintain some control over the East Coast, but time is running short. Already, we are receiving reports that the rebel organisation known as the Equestrian Liberation Front is mobilising huge swathes of the local population against our rule. If we don't want a full-blown revolution on our hooves, so soon after our hard-earned victory during the Great War, action must be taken soon, and fast."

A semi-autonomous military Protectorate, free to make their own decisions near-instantaneously and without bureaucratic red tape, might have had the versatility to contain the unrest before it became unmanageable. But the Manehattan Protectorate had not been formed, and now, it is too late.\n\nStarlight Glimmer and Trixie Lulamoon, leaders of the Equestrian Liberation Front, are rallying armies of pony resistance fighters, in which the remnants of regular Royal Equestrian Army units form a formidable backbone.

Under the banner of the Equestrian Liberation Front, dissidents and ideologues of all stripes stand together, paying no heed to the doctrinal quibbles and internecine infighting that once plagued the subversive left and right alike, united in their common dream of a free Equestria.\n\nFrom Stalliongrad to New Mareland to the Riverlands, be they of the Three Tribes, or batponies, griffons, or hippogriffs, the brave fighters of the ELF have converged, from all over the world, to gather on the plains of the Equestrian East Coast. Alongside the Harmonic Resistance - now risen from the shadows - they take up arms to participate in this Liberatory Endeavour. The thirst for freedom had always burned within the hearts of the ponies living under the Changeling jackboot, and from those embers, a veritable firestorm has now erupted to scour the Queendom's black taint from Equestria's fair lands.\n\nAt the forefront stands the Duumvirate, Starlight Glimmer and Trixie Lulamoon - the matriarchs of revolution, heirs to the fallen Diarchy. But the uprising was borne not out of their visionary imaginings alone, but from the sacrifices of ponies bled and killed in the collective struggle against the invader; it is the blood, tears, and sweat of these unsung heroes that serve as the glue binding together the constituent parts of this nascent revolution.\n\nAt the dawn of what may well be Equestria's penultimate struggle, the ponies rally under a flag of the Sun and Moon combined - two symbols of Equestria united, flanked by swords drawn in their defense - in what may be the rebirth - or the last hurrah - of the Cradle of Ponykind."

I had this whole speech planned out, but I'm not going to bandy words around here. The ELF has begun its uprising, and we've got the changelings on the ropes, but we can't do this on our own. Each of you have fought in your own ways for years, and you're exactly the kind of fighters we must have if we're to succeed. We've been divided too long, and the only way Equestria can be reborn is if we stand united."\n\nSadly, the proposition of unity was a hard sell for many of the different factions. Some of them had strict ideas about what Equestria should be, and while Starlight could give assurances, many of them still were suspicious. It came to a head with the grizzled leader of the Deepfall Timberwolves asking why they should rally their forces to, in the end, just put some old cult leader on the Equestrian throne.

The mare, a pegasus named Lydia Merrimare, seemed strangely nervous though. \n\n"Have... I done anything wrong ma'am?" She asked and Starlight raised an eyebrow.

I was looking over some of the documents from your office, and you're pretty much doing half the job there on your own. You are wasted there, and I want to employ you at the head office of the ELF." Strangely, Lydia seemed to only sink deeper in her seat at this. "What's wrong? \n\n"I..." Lydia hesitated. "I am just a regular mare ma'am... I do not have high aspirations.

MAN_ELF_new.148.d:0 "Verdant Flora's ears were ringing. What had she expected when she joined the ELF? She knew she would end up having to aid the cause one way or another. And indeed, here she was, part of a woefully outnumbered force, her comrades around her struggling to halt the advance of the Changeling forces. And here she wasn't, the Duumvir Trixie Lulamoon, who had for so long agitated the ponies, promised them freedom, led them on this expedition, and yet was now nowhere to be found.\n\nA certain bitterness filled Verdant's heart. What would become of her? This battle was nothing short of hopeless. Would she be remembered by her friends and family as a hero, or would she become yet another statistic of this grim war?\n\nAs the merciless changeling onslaught continued, Verdant noticed something peculiar. It was a thunderstorm cloud - a massive cumulonimbus - drifting towards them unusually quickly, leaving a trail of heavy rain on the battlefield. The changelings didn't seem to be particularly perturbed, for they were preoccupied with pushing back the ponies with cheer. Verdant sighed and braced herself for the rain. Could this day get any worse?\n\nBut the rain never came.\n\nAs the cloud drifted above the clashing soldiers, a terrible booming noise echoed from its depths, startling pony and changeling alike. Before either knew what was going on, a vibrant torrent of energy blasts and bullets exploded out from within, raining down upon the absolutely unprepared changelings. The barrage from high was unrelenting, sending the changeling units into chaos as panic spread, causing many to flee in any direction to avoid the sudden attack.\n\nThe intense torrents of magic and firepower caused the cloud to quickly dissipate, and the truth of the situation immediately became obvious: shrouded within the thick folds of the cloud were teams of unicorn mages, two to a small blimp, flanked by a screen of airborne pegasi. It was apparent that the pegasi and the unicorns had combined their weather manipulation abilities and magic to conceal themselves within the cloud to launch a surprise attack from on high.\n\nAnd, shining like a flare at the forefront, was Trixie Lulamoon herself, her horn glowing fiercely with bright blue light as the pegasus-unicorn shocktroops hovered above the battlefield, her bursts of magic taking down multiple changelings at a time. The sight was beautiful and terrifying. Trixie's voice echoed from above. \"Don't give up hope, everypony! The great and powerful Tri- no, the great and powerful Resistance can take on any challenge! We fight for our loved ones! We fight for our home! We fight for Equestria!\"\n\nThe effect on both sides' morale was remarkable. The changelings, although still vastly outnumbering the ponies, were in a sorry state as entire companies broke up in the disorder and panic. And the ponies, who had previously been the ones nearly on a brink of a rout, were now cheering Trixie's name and charging into the disrupted changeling ranks. Verdant Flora joined in the counterattack, her eyes burning with newfound hope. Before the day was over, the ponies had completely repelled the attack and the changelings had suffered an incredibly embarassing defeat."

MAN_ELF_new.150.d:0 "The staff hall in the Manehattan Polytechnic was empty. Everypony was asleep, or working late into the night on some sort of government project. Or so it should have been, were it not for the two professors arguing as they sifted over a pile of leaflets which were distributed across the Protectorate just this morning as part of a greater "awareness campaign" providing information on the short-lived regime of Daybreaker and her Solarist government.\n\n\"I recognise this data. Our very institution procured it covertly during Daybreaker's reign. There is absolutely nothing inauthentic about these leaflets - it's less than neutral in tone but the data it presents is indisputably accurate\", the younger stallion explained.\n\n\"So what, pray tell, should one do in this situation? Do you figure the Resistance should come out and condemn a unifying symbol, and thus legitimise the Changeling occupiers? Do you realise the ramifications of such an act?\", the older professor retorted, annoyance tinging his voice. This assertion only agitated the younger professor further.\n\n\"A unifying symbol, my flank! Daybreaker was a war criminal! The atrocities committed by the Solarists are unspeakable, and you suggest we should disregard them in favour of some sort of faux unity? What about justice for the victims and their families?\"\n\nThe older stallion sighed and shook his head.\"The memory of Celestia is a crucial factor to uniting the ponies under a common cause. To aid the Changelings in tarnishing her memory would help absolutely nopony. It's not that I think it's right - it's that I think it's the lesser evil. The ponies must focus on the current threat at hoof.\"\n\n\"And how are we any better than our occupiers if we surrender our values and glorify a tyrant for our own benefit? How could we stand up to them and say we fight for freedom and Equestria after defending tyranny and injustice?\"\n\n\"The time for reconciliation and exposition of the truth will come, but only after we are rid of the Changeling yoke! The difference is that we do this for the greater good, whilst the changelings are simply tyrants who will resort to all means in oppressing and exploiting us.\"\n\nThe debate continued long into the night, and in the end it ended up going in circles with no conclusion in sight. It was, after all, a very difficult question. Should the ponies stay true to their values and swallow the propaganda condemning Daybreaker, therefore legitimising the Changeling regime? Or should they steel themselves and pay no heed to the slandering of Celestia's memory - no matter how factual and indubitably evil Daybreaker's crimes had been - in order to protect the ponies' unity against Changeling rule?

Panzers and armoured bulldozers ramming through pathetic barricades to demolish the city blocks beyond; black plumes of smoke spewing from buildings set ablaze by cannon fire; the monolithic bleakness of the refugee camps on the far outskirts of Manehattan's urban sprawl; Changeling jackboots pounding down the rubble-strewn avenues of ruined neighborhoods. The scream of klaxons ringing through empty streets of districts slated for "redevelopment", populated only by ghosts and the desperate living. The camera lingering on the bawling face of the newborn foal clutched tight in his mother's grip, before they are swept away by the tide of ponies fleeing westwards into the setting sun, away from the carnage of Manehattan.\n\nLysia is snapped out of her reverie by the dinner conversation; down the table there is raucous laughter. Amongst the guests, Lysia recognises some faces; here the Chairpony of the now-acquiescent Fillydelphia Motors, there the Chief Financial Officer from Nidhogg, and other captains of industry and wealthy magnates, all here in celebration of the Protectorate's next ambitious exercise in triumphal grandeur - the construction of a planned city named after the victorious Queen, Chrysalia, within Manehattan itself.\n\nIn the next room over, an antechamber off of the opulent dining hall, the sounds of a muted argument are slowly growing louder, over a table strewn with maps and diagrams detailing the redevelopment of Manehattan. Lysia's interest is roused; she had expected fierce backlash to the Ost-Kommando's plan to remake the megalopolis in the Changeling image, but not at the very dinner party celebrating the launch of the plan!\n\nIt is a well-dressed pony who is arguing with a Changeling. Something stirs within Lysia, as she grasps at the emerging hope that she might have to call off the redevelopment plan after all. The image of the crying foal crosses her mind's eye, and when she lets it linger, his face morphs into that of a Changeling larvae; echos of the changelings' Unification Wars. She is ridden with a growing sense of premature guilt, Lysia realises, for the atrocities she is soon to preside over in the name of progress.\n\nHer presence alone is enough to quiet her arguing guests. Now now, she says, softening the bite of her stern tone with a trace of motherliness. What do we have here?\n\nTell the pony bastard, the changeling snarls (Lysia does not know his name), that the plan is not being postponed at the whim of some moralising sap who dares to stand in the way of progress, and at this vitriol the pony rears his head in anger. Lysia expects an impassioned plea for the salvation of the districts slated for demolition, the anguish of a creature who, in the depths of capitulation, had decided to finally take a stand against the unstoppable Changeling tide.\n\nThe ramifications of enacting such a plan on the Hayston area would be unconscionably horrific, the pony says, and delight blooms within Lysia as she discovers that perhaps somepony on her staff has retained some semblance of a conscience, or sanity, or both.\n\n"We would be better off arranging for much of the redevelopment to take place in Bronclyn, by the sea, where Chrysalia would benefit from a superior geographical location."\n\nThe pony keeps on talking, citing statistics and whatnot, whilst his changeling opponent responds with mounting anger. Lysia is no longer listening, her thoughts returned to scenes of misery and desolation wrought upon the city that she had been forced to rule over, but had nonetheless become her home.\n\nThe quiet brings her back to reality.

She couldn't quite think that much more though, as she suddenly forgot how to.\n\n"That was quite the fall. Are you okay madmoiselle?" the stallion asked... could a voice sound like honey?

Whatever the future may hold, for now the mandate of power will not issue forth from the royal throne, but from our laws and decrees.

"For years, as our nation suffered under the changeling yoke, it was not the princesses that carried on the fight, nor did the elements of harmony smite Chrysalis down! No, those who kept up the fight were regular ponies, ponies without immense magical gifts or grand titles! You fought, you bled and even died. Yet again and again, like a crashing wave, you surged forth to fight; for your homeland, for your people, for freedom! You did not have the Elements of Harmony, but you have courage and determination in endless amounts.\n\nFrom protestors in the streets, you masked themselves and began sabotaging the invaders' efforts. You then picked up weapons, waiting for opportunities to strike our enemy wherever they were the most vulnerable. When the great rising came, you rose up in the hundreds of thousands and ever since, you have carried this war of liberation! You are the strength in our legs, the champions of our freedom, indeed the heroes of the new age! They said the age of heroes were over, yet look at you now! What greater heroes could anyone ask for?!\n\nYou are no longer resistance militias or guerillas, no simple peasant uprising or revolt! You are soldiers of Equestria, parts of an army greater than any Equestria has ever seen! From today, you are soldiers of the Ponies' Liberation Army!" As Trixie finished her speech, right on time, the squadron of pegasi shot past over her head with a roar, leaving streaks in the air in the Equestrian colors. The gatheres soldiers in front of her rose in a thunderous cheer, shaking the very ground with their hooves and their roars, and  Trixie raised one hoof in the air, leading them in a deafening chant."

With guns drawn, the Constabulary stormed the offices of their predecessor organisation; for having put up an armed resistance when the Changelings conquered Manehattan, the police force had been outlawed and disbanded, with those officers who had turned themselves in being sent to internment camps. The headquarters were abandoned and thus deserted, and so the collaborationists wasted no time occupying the premises, breaking into locked safes and filing cabinets, rifling through decades' worth of police records to sift through the valuable information in their pages.\n\nThe Constabulary included a few former policeponies, turncoats who had pledged their services to the new regime. At the ransacking of what had been their former sanctum, there were those who took it with a sense of apathetic detachment. For others, it signalled a break with the old, a sort of violent induction into the ranks of the New Order.\n\nA Changeling flag now occupies the space where the crest of the MCPD once adorned the face of their headquarters. The mandate of upholding Law and Order may have been adopted by the Constabulary, but whether they will ever come to replace the old police in the eyes of the ponies remains to be seen."

Ponies had made a Nightmare Moon out of us, and there wasn't much that we could do to back then, other than make it as brief and as painless a process as possible.  It was funny the first few times seeing their stares of disbelief when we turned out to be working members of society and not some Hatcher-damned monsters. Then the disbelief turned into apathy, and the whole process, while still rather unpleasant for them, became routine.\n\nSome people like routine; routine equates to safety. No news is good news and all. But I yearned for something out of it all, and it wasn't the love that I tasted when extracting it.\n\nI only discovered what it was earlier today at a café that had only opened up to changelings. I was persuaded by a fellow officer to try it out, as they supposedly have the best crepes in town. I'm not really a fan of them, but he's a colleague, so I obliged him. Everything was fairly normal, even the wary gazes from the pony patrons who recognised our uniforms.\n\nWhat surprised me was one of them who instead of shooting us a leer instead waved us over to his table. I recognised him as a resident from my district where I work. My colleague and I were confused, but we didn't taste anything suspicious from the stallion, just a warm and welcoming aura.\n\nWe shared a few drinks and delectable snacks before I had to ask: why was he so friendly to 'a bunch of Nightmare Moons in bug form?'\n\nI'll never forget what he told me. "Well, I know ponies don't like what your Queen's done, but that doesn't mean that we should hate you specifically. I still remember when the city was still barely more than rubble, and despite everything, you've done so much for us. You specifically don't want to see us suffer in misery, and you've done your darndest to make our lives that much easier. How can I hate you for that?"\n\nI don't expect to receive this gratitude from everypony that I meet, but he's gotten me thinking. Perhaps there's more that we could do for the ponies? Maybe I'm just hopelessly naïve, but I wouldn't mind being offered a mug of cider by more of the ponies that I come by.\n\n — An extract from a Hauptkäff-Love Collector's journal."

At some point too many ponies had died for her to just sit by, and she'd found a zeal for fighting back she didn't even knew she was capable of. That, combined with her talent for misdirection had made her a surprisingly skilled general. That... and the fact that she felt alive on the battlefield, more alive than anywhere else... maybe she was wrong in the head?\n\nBut she wasn't wrong in the head enough that meetings had started to be any more bearable! \n\nLeaning back and trying to keep a smile, she watched the ponies sitting around the table, even as she wanted to leap out of the window. Sitting here, listening to random ponies twitter on about crap she didn't care about, was enough to make her despair. Yeah, sure, they weren't planning to become military dictators and had to demonstrate this to the ponies of Equestria. Yes, the disappearance of the princesses had terrified ponies and giving them a hoof in governance would help assuage their worries.

My past shames more specifically. Nopony, no matter how naive, will ever have earned the right to call me immaculate. Many years ago I was convinced that the cutie marks that make up our identity only divided us; that all they provided were causes for arrogance and methods of control. I resented them, indeed hoped for a Equestria without these marks.\n\nBitterly and reluctantly, I came to learn that our cutie marks; our diversity, is so much more than that. In many ways, it is the fabric that holds us together. As long as we embrace - truly embrace - that our diversity is the source of our unity, then we are all stronger for it. The petty mind will look to those different from them, be it in customs, birth, livelihood or anything else, and dismiss them, lest they fear they are reduced themselves.\n\nIn doing so, they they place their fragile egos above the welfare of everypony around them, preferring that we all are worse off instead of learning to understand and accept that which is unlike them. Once I was there, but no more. Now I see how Equestria is bound together not by any single pony, family or even tribe, but through this unity of cutie marks, individuals and tribes.\n\nWe are strong because we all contribute to a greater whole.We do not bicker about who contribues more, and we do not rush to blame the failings of our society on ponies just because they have or lack wings or horns. We are in this together, from the beginning to the bitter end, and division is just as petty and misguided as those who deflect blame  onto their siblings. It may help in the heat of the moment, but in the long run all it does is weaken the fabric of the nation. Indeed, they are worse! Indivduals may carry blame, but Earth Ponies, Pegasi or Unicorns never carry collective blame! Let blame stay where it belongs, with the single ponies, and let appreciation for the gifts our diversity brings shine down on all of us! We are Equestrians, we are many and we are different, but we are indivisible all the same!""

And she was alone on this side. This was crazy! She wasn't a hero, she was a knitter! Before all this all she'd wanted was a chance for her patterned scarves to be shown off to the world.

The first grenade blew up the machinegun nest and cast up smoke enough that when Scarlet bolted up the slope and in among their positions she was covered enough.

It was the only place they hadn't searched this far, and the engineers took their time to not damage the contents.\n\nWhen the safe finally was opened after a near hour, Duty Price could pick out the contents. Just a single binder. Bringing it with him, he opened it to pour over the contents as they walked. Sure enough, Project Dusk Shine. There was more stuff here though... Some talk about "Subject A". A live test subject? He wouldn't put it past the bugs... No wait...\n\nWhile he couldn't make heads or tails of most of the stuff in there, he could at least tell that whatever Subject A was, it wasn't that they were testing anything on it, but what were they doing then?"

Snipers and partisan sharpshooters took aim at the train from further away, blowing out every window they could see as the Timberwolves charged it, leaping up between the carts and breaking down the doors.\n\nStarlight Glimmer had refused to stay behind, instead joining the attack. She ripped down one of the walls of the train cart with her magic, too enraged to give a damn about finesse. Catching every last changeling in the cart, she smashed them into the ceiling with the force of a wrecking ball. The walls and ceiling of the train were peeled away under the raw force of her magic as she advanced from cart to cart, a seething energy field around her and bolts of blinding energy turning the changelings that tried to stop her to ashes. "WHERE, IS, SHE!?" she roared, her voice thundering across the train as she peeled the next cart open like it was paper. "YOU WON'T WIN! YOU WON'T ESCAPE!

Go!"\n\nRolling her neck and stretching her wings, Storm Cloud rose from her prone position on the cloud and grabbed the satchels by her side before launching herself off the cloud and accelerating explosively enough that she left a trail in the air and catching up to the train in less than a minute. Blazing past it, she caught up with the locomotive and went into a spin. The momentum let her launch the satchels like from a slingshot onto the locomotive, in between the wheels and even through the window of the locomotive, and with a sharp turn outwards she slammed down the button on her remote to blow it all up. The shockwave struck her and she was sent crashing helplessly into the ground as the now burning locomotive tumbled off the rail, dragging several of the rail carts with it.\n\n"Shimmerswirl, juice us up!"

It felt fitting, somehow, for what she was doing.\n\nSo much had happened in these last months and years, from the war to her being captured and then freed by Starlight and Trixie's army. Now she stood before something she never could have imagined would happen: she was going to ascend the throne of Equestria. Celestia and Luna weren't around, and yet Equestria wanted a princess. What more, with the chaos of the last years she needed to be more than just the Princess of Friendship; she needed to be the Princess of Harmony itself. After all... Equestria needed a symbol. She had a hard enough time imagining herself as a princess, but a princess with so lofty a title? It was absurd, and she felt like she would be just a symbol for ponies to look at.\n\n"Are you ready, your highness?" a voice asked behind her and Twilight schooled herself, putting on a smile as she turned around to follow the pony that had been sent to bring her to the coronation. As she entered the great chamber where the people were waiting she was met with cheering ponies, hundreds of them. More than one of the ponies in attendance were crying as well, and their sheer joy hit her like a tonne of bricks, giving her a sudden resolve.\n\nMaybe she felt like just some stupid filly playing princess, but as she looked at all the ponies, so happy for her return, she decided she'd play the best princess she possibly could."

He was immaculately dressed still, but the look on his face was that of someone utterly exhausted.\n\n"Across most of Griffonia," Blueblood answered, "I took the opportunity during my exile to study the conflicts across that continent. The griffons know a lot about warfare, things that could have been useful to know before the war. Anyway I have compiled what I've learned, and I wanted to offer you my services, such as they are."\n\n"There is a story here, isn't there?"

She therefore decided to dig further.\n\n"I..." Blueblood said reluctantly, "I was made a Field Marshal because I lobbied for it. I wanted the fancy title, and when the war came I was unprepared for the reality of it. Maybe no single pony is wholly to blame for what happened to Equestria, but I was part of it. I have to make amends somehow, and this is the best I can do." Starlight couldn't have denied him even if she would have wanted to. Staring into his eyes, she saw too much of herself; an angry, self-loathing pony who had to make it right somehow, even if they didn't feel they deserved a second chance. She nodded slowly after a while, deciding to give him what he wanted.\n\n"Just your desire for redemption won't mean a thing. We will expect results, and you will provide them. If what you've documented is of use we'll use it, otherwise you will have to find another way to earn your place, is that understood?"

But tell me, old boy, you mentioned your Griffonian adventures had been quite illuminating. Would you care to finally elaborate on this?" Fancy Pants helped himself to a drink from one of the waiters and sipped it.\n\n"Creatures, be the ponies or griffons, need stability," Blueblood said as he helped himself as well. "When times become unruly they seek themselves to radical ideologies when the old ideals no longer provide sufficient answers. And when do the old ideals no longer deliver? Well, the great Griffonian Empire was torn apart because of vacillating rulers who took their positions for granted. In Aquileia, even beating down these extremists just led to another explosion later on because the issues were not addressed at the start."\n\n"And what were those issues?" Fancy Pants asked. \n\n"That the average griffon did not feel a stake in their nation any longer. It abandoned them, so they abandoned it. Times were hard, so it is understandable, but while they were seduced by radicals and maniacs, the nobility were too consumed by their own power games to remind the people what made the nation great to begin with." Blueblood looked out to the window, seeing the sunlight stream in through it. \n\n"Auntie Celestia kept this land safe for a thousand years, and yet now when she is no longer here ponies can forget how much she did. She created a milennium of peace, but somehow the answers she provided are no longer good enough. We need to remind ponies of what she did, of how she did it. We need to champion the values of that Equestria, the best possible version of them, and that is not a version where the rich and powerful saunter around consumed by their own concerns. Our families rose to the top in that world, but if we can't champion the values of the world that ennobled us then - frankly - we have no business reaping its fruits.""

Twilight gushed as she looked over Spike, "And that jawline—that neck: I remember you as a baby dragon, and now you look like you could punch a hole in the wall! Was... was I gone so long?" she suddenly trailed off as the implications came to her.\n\n"No, no, not really," Spike hurriedly assured her. "I mean yeah, it's been a while, but apparently this is a thing some dragons do."" He absently flexed his arm to show the muscles on it for emphasis. "It's a stress reaction to danger apparently; we suck in the latent magic around us to grow faster. That's why dragons in dangerous territories like the Everfree grow so big. After living with you for so many years, I had enough latent magic in me to finish off decades' of growth in no time."\n\n"That's so fascinating!" Twilight said, outright awed by what he said. To think that such a thing was possible. At first she wanted to take notes but she remembered herself and hugged Spike again. That was what mattered now . "Oh I'm so glad you're back Spike. Do you know where any of the others are?" she asked him after a while and noticed how Spike tensed up. "Spike?"\n\n"Ehehehe." Spike looked awkward all of a sudden. Twilight couldn't have missed the look on his face if they so had been in a pitch black room. He didn't want to tell her and Twilight could only feel a surge of fear.\n\n"Spike. Please tell me. I have to know. Nopony is telling me anything, and I am worrying myself sick." Her plea seemed to take as Spike visibly deflated, hanging his head.\n\n"Figures that I am the one who have to tell you..." he muttered sourly. "Fluttershy vanished during the first uprisings in the Everfree and nopony's seen her for years. Rainbow Dash was shot down over Marechester. They never found a body, but if she was alive she'd have come back by now. Pinkie's alive, but she's not really Pinkie any more. The war got to her, bad. As for Rarity and Applejack,"" Spike sighed deeply, "they are held by the military on charges of collaboration.""

MAN_ELF_new.1931.d:0 "The Fillydelphia streets were teeming with ponies from all over Equestria, with the main road packed to a level where it was at times hard to even move. The walls of the buildings were lined with photos and messages, with giant letters on the rooftops to indicate which names went were. Ponies walked from wall to wall, pouring over the counteless messages, fervently trying to find something from those they lost contact with during the war. Pegasi flew back and forth, many of them carrying other ponies on their backs to help them move around. In one corner, an auctioneer was using his talents to loudly and rapidly call out names using a loudspeaker, yelling out the names of those the ponies around him sought.\n\nTwilight Sparkle had ended up under A, scanning after Applejack's name, when she noticed a young colt trying to jump so that he could see the wall as well. Picking him up with her magic, she helped him to scan the wall for his aunt. The poor kid was emaciated, and she wondered what had happened to his parents. She decided not to ask though, she could hazard a guess. When they found the name and an address she gave the wall a quick look, deciding she could come back to it later, she needed to make sure that he got there safely. Thankfully, the address wasn't too far off, and a quick flight later she was treated to the sight of the colt's aunt tearfully hugging him, thanking her over and over for finding him.\n\nUpon returning to the wall and keeping up looking, she realized after nearly an hour that she couldn't see Applejack's name anywhere. Maybe Fluttershy would be under F then? Continuing down the wall, she reached F after several minutes and began pouring over it, asking if anypony had seen anything. No bet here either. The same for Pinkie Pie, Rarity and Rainbow Dash. Finishing at S for Spike, she realized with a sinking feeling in her heart that she couldn't find any of them. None of them had left anything to show their whereabouts. Quietly, she realized what it might mean but shook her head. No, there had to be some other explanation. Maybe they hadn't gotten here yet. Maybe they'd be here tomorrow. She had to come back tomorrow. They'd have left something then. She just needed to keep looking..."

MAN_ELF_new.194.d:0 "The courtroom was packed to the brim and Twilight only barely managed to enter the stands overlooking the procedure. Her stomach flipped at the sight, seeing how Rarity sat in the accused's seat, right next to... Suri Polomare? And what more, Rarity was sitting slouched together, almost as though she had already been sentenced, while Suri almost preened where she sat.\n\n"Suri Polomare and Rarity," the prosecution said, reading out their crimes. "During the occupation of Manehattan, you produced new uniforms for the Changelings' jägers that they used in hunting down our people. Uniforms specifically meant for city combat, and which helped them kill many ponies. This was not an assigned job, but rather you actively courted the Lysia administration with it." Twilight could only listen in silent disbelief at what she was hearing.\n\n"As you'll find, your honor," Suri stated airily, "the designs for those changeling uniforms were, one hundred percent, Rarity's designs. I was merely a producer of the garments, but she was the brain behind it."\n\n"How do you respond to this, miss Rarity?" the judge asked and a sniffle came from Rarity.\n\n"It's true!" she suddenly wailed, crying openly. "I designed all of it! I came up with the cut of the jackets and the seams, I put in every last hook and belt loop on it with my own two hooves! I am completely responsible for those uniforms, and every last bit of impact they had was due to me!" she trailed off in sobbing as her attorney stared at her in horror."\n\n"Y-your honor," he tried to butt in  "my client was under coercion the entire time and...!"\n\n"But I still did iiiiit!" Rarity cried, and Suri leaned back, the very picture of smug satisfaction."

MAN_ELF_new.195.d:0 ""Well there you have it, your honor," Suri declared proudly, with the judge scowling at the two. "I had no part in this beyond regular business, and she was the one who made them." She nudged her attorney, who reluctantly asked for another witness to be called in. This witness, Under Cover, had been a counter-infiltrator in the changeling occupation forces, and the prosecution wheeled in examples of the uniform for him to comment on. Under Cover looked at the uniforms before chuckling.\n\n"Those... were the most evil clothes I have ever worn! They were great during the first month or so, but the more you used them, the more they just... hurt. They started squeezing in odd places, seams dug in right between the changelings' shells and if you laid down you'd have buttons pushing straight into your crotch. Laying down hurt like you wouldn't believe! Honestly, during the uprising, I'd say those uniforms did the work of a hundred ponies in distracting and tormenting the jägers! Who made those uniforms? I want to shake their hoof!"\n\nSilence reigned in the hall when Under Cover was done with his story. The judge's eyes were open wide, Suri Polomare's smirk had been traded for a look of horror and Rarity had straightened up, reaching over to gently push Suri's mouth closed. The case was more or less finished there and then. Suri and Rarity had both agreed after all: Rarity had the full credit for how the uniforms had impacted the war, and she was cleared of all charges. \n\nAs she got up from her seat she looked back to the still paralysed Suri and leaned in to whisper in her ear. "I do find gloating tacky, dear." she purred before turning and leaving, making sure to hip-check Suri as she passed her by. When she exited the room Twilight was already there to meet her, eyes wide with awe as she threw herself at her friend to hug her.\n\n"That-that." she could only say, still in awe by what just had happened.\n\n"Hello darling," Rarity answered "I'm sorry I couldn't come earlier, as you saw I was preoccupied."\n\n"But, that was amazing Rarity, how did you even manage to pull something like that off, that was..." Twilight stopped now as Rarity suddenly leaned against her, seemingly struggling to stay on her hooves.\n\n"I'm sorry darling. I just realized. I'm out... years under that utter slag... and I'm out... Can we go get some fresh air, please?""

MAN_ELF_new.196.t:0 "One Bad Apple?"
MAN_ELF_new.196.d:0 "Applejack looked like she had aged twenty years, and her eyes were bitter and hard where she sat behind the desk, listening to the prosecution reading out the charges levied against her. Was it true that during the changeling occupation Sweet Apple Acres expanded massively, using Changeling funds? Was it true that they, through this aggressive expansion, had provided a large amount of the changeling army's food supply? Was it true that she had personally courted the local governor to be able to take Ponyville residents as slave labor, employing thousands towards the end? Applejack answered yes at every question, leaving Twilight watching everything in disbelief and horror in equal amounts.\n\nAs her lawyer stood up though, he took out a small book and read from it. The book was from the Sweet Apple Acres offices, and as the lawyer read it all out, he named worker after worker along with their notes, drawing special attention to how Applejack had meticulously kept track of how long they had worked, how badly they reacted to the "love tax" and what other needs they had. Asking several questions from Applejack for clarity, he painted a wholly different picture: one where Applejack might have expanded Sweet Apple Acres to a giant factory farm, but where she had done so to shield as many of her more vulnerable neighbors as possible from the changelings feeding on them.\n\nThe prosecution called these things speculations and wishful thinking, saying she could just as well have employed ponies at her regular farm if giving out work was so important. The central plains had been vital to the changelings' food supply, and actively expanding still constituted collaboration and has caused harm to other ponies. \n\nIn return, the defense noted that it had taken over a year for Applejack to actually start expanding her farm, a year during which she continued her regular practices and hired only as many as she could. Quotas had not been met that year, and an extra love-tax had been used as punishment. Three workers had died and twelve had been hospitalized as the changelings had imposed a partciularly harsh drain on their emotions. It was first after that that Applejack had expanded, not a second before.\n\n After hours of exhausting back and forth, the Judge had heard enough and declared his verdict."

As long as the wages you wrote down are paid, you are cleared of all charges." With that the trial was over. Twilight rushed out of the room and around to the back to meet her friend, overjoyed. Yet she found an Applejack not nearly as pleased. Instead, she was standing outside the court building, pounding her hooves into a tree.\n\n"Stupid, fancy flank, chatterbox, horseapple!" she was snarling, punctuating every word with a punch at the tree, only stopping when Twilight pulled her away."Twilight? Oh. You saw all that huh?" Applejack asked, still too worked up to stop being angry. "Buck it all to hell. Why? Why did that damn lawyer have to butt in?! Couldn't he just have minded his own damn business and let me pay mah dues?! Is everything so messed up now that Ah'm gonna have to get away with all this?!"\n\n"But—didn't the lawyer tell the truth?" Twilight asked, not understanding why her friend was still so angry. "That you did what you had to?\n\n"Had to?!" Applejack yelled as she began to pace."You know what Ah had to do? Ah had to watch three of mah friends die before Ah got it into mah thick skull that it’d only get worse unless Ah did something—anything! Ah had to bow and scrape for that that self-satisfied bug instead of punching him in his stupid face when he preened at me! Ah had to sell out the entire Apple family way of doing things and turn mah home into a factory! AH HAD TO SUCK UP TO FLIM AND FLAM TO GET THEIR BUCKING MACHINES SO AH COULD DELIVER WHAT THE BUGS WANTED!" She began pounding the tree again, even harder this time.\n\n"Ah had to send off mah life's work for the changelings to eat as they butchered mah fellow ponies! Ah had to lie, scheme, sit there with that damn list and choose who of mah neighbors Ah'd send to the slaughter! And now Ah had to listen to that plothole in a tie make excuses for me!" In the end, it was as though the air went out of Applejack and she sank down on the ground, covering her face.\n\n"Ah know you forgive me Twilight. Mah neighbors probably will too. But Ah ain't never going to forgive mahself. Ah ain't gonna make excuses, Ah still helped them, and now Ah'm made out to be some tragic hero." Lowering her hooves, she stared up into the sky. "You still need me, Twilight? 'Cause if Ah ain't got helping you, Ah don't know what Ah have that's still me right now.""

MAN_ELF_new.198.d:0 "The letter that had arrived from Pinkie's family had left Twilight out of the door and heading for south Equestria within minutes, not even giving Spike time to pack before they were off and heading for the Pie Family's rock farm. She would have barreled right in, but the letter had very pointedly and politely asked she observed due discretion, and therefore she had instead gone to the nearby city of Rockville, where Limestone had met her to "show her something".\n\nThis "something" was the local day care, which Twilight noted was open despite being so late in the afternoon. She grimaced when they peered in through one of the windows and saw the downcast looking children inside. Of course... orphans.\n\n"So many of them..." she said to herself.\n\n"Used to be even more," Limestone commented. "Watch." As she finished this word the door at the far end of the room they watched burst open. Like a cotton candy tornado, Pinkie Pie came whirling in, as vibrant and joyful as Twilight had ever remembered her, and her infectuous cheer lit up the room within moments.\n\n"Oh! What's that in your ear?" she asked one of the younger fillies, pulling out a cupcake from it. "Hey! Caramel! I wonder if I have anything." Stopping, she reached into her own ear, seemingly rummaging around. "Wait, no that's the piano, no that's the ottoman. What is an ottoman anyway? Aha!" As she pulled her hoof out an entire three-layer cake followed. with candles and everything. Twilight could only pull back from the window and sigh in relief.\n\n"Don't count your rocks before they've been dug up," Limestone muttered, dragging Twilight to the back of the daycare where they hid by the bushes. There, some time later, Twilight realized what Limestone had meant as they saw Pinkie leave after a while, looking utterly spent. The vibrancy and joy was gone from her, and even her hair seemed to just droop. She was like a pale shadow of the Pinkie that had been in there, and she walked listlessly towards the train station."

She didn't move or look back, just remained in place, and in the end Twilight had to awkwardly come out from cover and approach her old friend.\n\n"Hi Pinkie." She said uncertainly. What could she even say right now? "I... I saw you at the daycare. I'm sorry I didn't say hi earlier."\n\n"It's fine. I'm sorry I didn't contact you, I just..." she trailed off, scraping the ground with her hoof. "I wanted to become the old Pinkie before I came back." Her voice was almost inaudible now. At this, Twilight walked up to her and hugged her. \n\n"Pinkie, please." To see Pinkie like this tore at her soul. "That you are alive matters more than every party in the universe. Please don't believe that we think you have to be happy and cheerful after everything that's happened."\n\n"But I'm supposed to be the element of laughter, and I can't even smile without faking it. When everypony needed me to be my most cheerful I couldn't. All of... everything... I don't know if I'm still me." Twilight could feel how Pinkie began to shake and she tightened her embrace. After a while, Pinkie hugged back, a slow, shivering breath escaping her. "I even forgot how to cry," she whimpered. Twilight said nothing, only holding her friend to give her the time she needed. "I'm not broken," Pinkie whispered in the end, "I swear. I'm putting myself back together, the glue is just bad."\n\n"You don't have to prove anything to me, or anypony else," Twilight whispered back."Please, just that you're okay is all I ask for. We missed you."\n\n"I missed you too," Pinkie replied. "Can I still come with you?"Twilight could only frown at this, stroking her friend's hair.\n\n"I told you Pinkie, you don't have to prove yourself." Pinkie pulled away, wiping her cheeks.\n\n"Yeah, to other ponies. I'm scared of going back to Ponyville... but I have to, right?

We'd all heard about the defeat, and many from the town had even fought against them, but seeing a uniformed changeling felt surreal.\n\n"The one with the peaked cap, the officer, barked orders to the soldiers, and within just a half-hour, everypony was gathered at the main square. Say what you will about the bugs, but they know how to get things done quickly and in an organised manner.\n\n"Not having been told what was happening, some of the adults openly wept in fear that these was one of the rumoured executions. The changeling officer quickly noticed, however, and he immediately clarified that they were here to 'extract their owed love quota.'\n\n"The townfolk grew frightened upon hearing this. We'd all heard the stories of dried-up corpses lining the streets of Canterlot in the days following its surrender. The horrible result of the changelings having their way with the survivors. Was this to be the fate of our humble town?\n\n"It didn't take long for lines to form. They had us walk up to some strange drums that they'd brought with them. The adults went first, with couples and those with kids taking precedence. We watched with bated breath as a pink essence was siphoned out of the family of four and into two soldiers. We were shocked to see that whatever discomfort that the family suffered through was extraordinarily brief and mild.\n\n"When the officer tasted our surprise, he laughed: "Why would we want to hurt you unnecessarily? We need you to remain healthy if we want to live."\n\n"It made some sense, but it didn't make the extraction any less uncomfortable. Somepony likened it as a part of our self being whisked away by a frigid hoof, and I have to agree. I didn't like it one bit, but I suppose that it could have been worse.\n\n"The soldiers took turns syphoning our love and filling the metal drums, cycling with another pair after doing so twice. It was real quick. They were done within the hour, and the officer thanked us for our cooperation before packing up and leaving.\n\n"Nopony knows what to make of it. Everypony's now convinced that they'll be back for more, but nopony knows when that'll be. I gotta say, if they keep it to maybe once a week, I think I could live with this.""

Twilight had been forced to teleport past her guards twice before they understood that she wasn't going to "send somepony". At least she was there now and decided to play nice with Shield Wall and Phalanxx, the two stallions that had followed her here. They seemed at first insistent to play stony, but Donut Joe identified them as two of his best customers and pointed Twilight to what they'd prefer. Within a minute they left the donut shop, Twilight having her box of donuts and the two guards awkwardly eating a Pistachio Glaze and a Triple Chocolate donut respectively.\n\n"You have good taste, I like those too!" Twilight told them merrily. "I've got a couple more of those, if you'd want to you can have those when we get ba-ACK!" she croaked when Shield Wall suddenly tackled her to the ground and threw up a barrier over them, with Phalanx firing a bolt of energy straight into the sky. Something above her was hit and she heard a grunt as someone crashed into the ground with Phalanx charging forward at it. It all went so fast that she didn't quite get what was happening as Shield Wall got off her and charged the attacker as well.

"Right, lesson learned, never try to surprise a friend when YOU two jerks are around. Hey Twilight!" She continued with a grin, coming over to help her up. Twilight meanwhile could only stare at her. Maybe she shouldn't be surprised, but the scars that criss-crossed Rainbow's face and the prosthetic left wing left her speechless at first. "Yeah I know," Rainbow chuckled, "I look like every pony in Uglyville bucked me in the face. But hey, look at you! All princessy and stuff! Never thought it'd suit you that well, egghead!"\n\nThat was the point that Twilight felt herself able to react. All she could do was to burst into laughter and embrace her friend.

"What have you been up to? Last I heard, you were shot down over Marechester during the last days of the invasion." \n\n"Uuuuugh," Rainbow Dash groaned, "Do we have to? Would it be okay if we just got blasted on cider for the evening and take all the touchy-feely stuff-hey!" she exclaimed as the bottle was torn out of her grip by Twilight's telekinesis. "Fiiine. Yeah they shot me down. I thought I could take on a squad of fighters on my own and well... yeah." she said as she spread the prosthetic to indicate what she meant. "I crashed in the lake and still have no idea how I managed to crawl ashore. Some of the local resistance ponies found me and dragged me to this underground base they had in the Honey Forest. They even had a hospital there!"\n\n"Is that where you got the prosthetic?" Twilight asked quietly.\n\n"Yeah! And the docs there couldn't have been greater jerks about it!" Rainbow exclaimed. "It was all "weeh weeh you rush around to command soldiers, you need to rest" and "wuuh wuuh you gotta take it CAREFUL with the new wing". Like, if I can't use it at once, what's even the point?! They even strapped me down in the end! Strapped, me, down! While Equestria was fighting back I was tied down in some horseapple's bed because they couldn't get the wing to work right off!" Her anger had grown and it was more like an explosion now as she ranted. Twilight quietly put a hoof on her shoulder to calm her down and Rainbow reluctantly stopped her outburst.\n\n"I know... I know..." she said, taking a few breaths. "I'm just a LITTLE angry I was this useless. Top Wonderbolt here, and I could have just spun on the spot and made windmill noises for all the help I was.\n\nI'm good though, I'm good. I've done my crying and ranting about it.

Even war hadn't dampaned its anger she thought as the Roc descended from above, screaming in rage as it forced her to make a sudden teleportation to get down into the forest to take cover. She barely was down, however, before a snarling Chimera came at her and her second teleport sent her tumbling into the swamp, where she barely was on her feet before an enraged Hydra rose up over her.\n\nAt this something snapped inside her. Usually she would have been content with playing it safe, but if the forest was really going to be this hostile, even when all she wanted was to find her friend, she was not going to run! Purple light exploded around her as she summoned up all the magic she had, making the forest tremble.\n\n"I'm sorry, but I'm not playing!" she screamed, grabbing the Hydra's heads with her telekinesis and slamming them against each other. She let the beast drop before grabbing the pouncing chimera and threw it past her and into a tree.

Around her, she could hear how the monsters were approaching again, and suddenly it all came together to her.\n\n"F-Fluttershy..." she gasped, "It's me Fluttershy..." Fluttershy didn't respond to her though, only kept staring her down with small, choked sounds coming from her, more akin to a terrified animal than a pony. Twilight tried desperately to think, come up with something, but the Stare was too strong to think properly!\n\n"They..." she groaned after a while. "They were protecting you weren't they? I... I hurt your friends. I'm sorry." At this, it seemed as though there was something that clicked in Fluttershy's eyes and the stare ended. She blinked; comprehension slowly dawning in her eyes. With it - though - came terror, and she backed away, seemingly about to flee.\n\n"Fluttershy wait!" Twilight hurried to exclaim, "It's over, there's peace, no more fighting, no more war!" She didn't approach the terrified mare, instead choosing to hunch down and fervently plead with her friend to not run away. Slowly talking her down, Twilight took one, then two, then three steps forward. "Please Fluttershy, it's all over. We can go home."\n\n"H-home?" Fluttershy whispered, her voice breaking as if she hadn't used it in years. Twilight nodded and slowly held out one hoof to Fluttershy, being rewarded with her friend almost tackling her, clutching her as tears burst from Fluttershy's eyes at the end of this years long nightmare.\n\nTwilight held her friend close, too relieved to say anything at first. As the shadow fell over her - though - she looked up, seeing the Hydra tower above them. It wasn't angry she realized. It was worried.

MAN_ELF_new.207.d:0 "The E.L.F. could pretend that it was a full army, but the truth was that in way too many cases they were a rebel organization, partisans and militias strapped for equipment and resources, and the more this war raged on the more it mattered. Starlight and Trixie had both found themselves forced to come up with a solution. As it was though, the alternatives looked grim.\n\n"I don't see how we can keep this going without doing something drastic," Starlight sighed as she poured over the latest reports. The initiative was everything for them right now, but without resources, they couldn't keep it.\n\n"And I can only pull rabbits out of my hat, not food for an army,"  Trixie agreed, slumping over the table as her disdain for paperwork finally took over. "Hey... should we make a grand show of "supporting the cause" and so? See how many donations we can get. Or heck, sell off the stuff in the museums to private collectors get money to buy whatever we can. It’ll take some of the strain off at least"\n\n"That's not going to help, not enough," Starlight grimaced. "And there's then the question what we do when ponies' charity dry up. I can't believe I'm saying this, but we'll probably have to requisition what we need by force..."\n\n"You mean steal?" Trixie drawled. "March into ponies' homes and take food, fuel, vehicles, anything we think we might need? Knew you'd become a tyrant in the end."\n\n"No! We would have to hand out IOUs to them and promise compensation after the war, but I don't see any other way we can do this right now. We need supplies equipment, and we need it now"\n\n"And we certainly can't rely on charity after pulling this stunt," Trixie pointed out."

Sometimes the Socialists are more trouble than they are worth."\n\n"I could have told you that," Trixie drawled. "What are they doing now?"\n\n"They're continuing to insist on staying outside the chain of command and keep their militias intact, voting for their officers and so on. It's getting messy, and the generals are getting really fed up with them. They're trying to centralize the militias but the socialists refuse. Sooner or later, they'll end up in trouble because of it. \n\n"So leave them intact then," Trixie said. "I know high command wants to have everything exactly the same always, but you can't always get what you want. Besides, it'll be the socialists who pay the price."\n\n"Maybe we should try to reason with them," Starlight mused. "Find some common ground. Maybe post-war concessions would work. If they don't integrate properly it'll be harder on everypony."\n\n"Just leave it." Trixie reiterated. "They'll learn their lesson in the end when their rag-tag bands can't get proper support." \n\n"Ponies will die, Trixie." \n\n"Ponies are dying no matter what we do, and letting the socialists bully us into getting special treatment isn't going to make anypony happy.

MAN_ELF_new.209.d:0 ""Well this is tacky," Starlight said as she read the list. It stood clear that if you had gotten in good with the changeling leadership the world was your oyster, and judging from the lists of luxury goods and special deliveries that they had seized, quite a few had taken the chance. They had seized tonnes of luxury items, mostly food, from all over the world. Trixie looked over the list as well, rolling her eyes at the sight, but then she grinned.\n\n"Tacky… but perfect! Remember how those nobleponies and industrialists in Manehattan? They weren't too happy with us after losing their fancy life. This is how we sort them out. Give them some of this stuff, treat them to a couple of nice dinners and give them a couple of new drapes or a sofa and they'll calm down and get more on our side!"\n\n"That's stupid," Starlight retorted. "This should go out among the average pony. Food shortages are already an issue. Are we seriously going to have fancy dinners while ponies go hungry?"\n\n"Do I need to remind you of our Saddle Arabia trip?" Trixie scoffed. "One haycake can't feed ten ponies. You'd be wasting it all instead of getting some actual use out of it. You know, a favor for a favor?"\n\n"It's about the message!" Starlight snapped. "What will the regular pony think when they see us sitting there, feasting while they hunger? We'd be giving the most to those who need the least when it should be the other way around!"\n\n"Oh here we go," Trixie rolled her eyes. "I knew you'd start paraphrasing Caramel Marks at some point. Do you want to make good use of this stuff or is it more important that everypony gets almost nothing instead of someponies something?!"\n\n"Maybe I'm trying to actually alleviate issues instead of coddling ponies whining about losing their third palace?!"

MAN_ELF_new.210.d:0 ""They are doing WHAT?!" Starlight exclaimed, slamming her hooves into the table as she stared down the officer. Slowly sinking back into her seat, she groaned. And now there were lynchings on top of everything else? It wasn't that it didn't make sense - after all, there were those who had collaborated, and there were those who had suffered because of it. Now, as the changeling stranglehold over Equestria was being broken, there were obviously going to be ponies looking to settle the score... "What do we do?" she asked Trixie.\n\n"Of course they'll want blood," Trixie muttered. "Too familiar - they feel slighted and now they ride on each other's backs... but you gotta give the crowd what they want, or they abandon you..."\n\n"Prison camps", she exclaimed. "We gather up whoever they accuse of collaboration and stick them in guarded camps. They can sit this one out and we deal with it later, maybe even use them for extra labour if we have to."\n\n"What?" Starlight couldn't believe her ears. "Are you seriously... we aren't even close to winning the war! Are we going to have these ponies stuck in camps for how long? Months? Years?"\n\n"Well, what's your alternative? Say "please don't"?!"\n\n"How about putting an end to the killing?! If we have to enforce martial law and patrol the streets to stop the riots and lynchings, then that's what we'll do."\n\n"And pull soldiers off the front lines?" Trixie asked incredulously. "Do you seriously think we can afford that?"\n\n"Do you think we can afford the divisions that having had large parts of Equestria locked up for years will cause when this war is over?"\n\n"Well, we're not even going to survive to see that with your idea!" Starlight and Trixie stared each other down, both equally enraged, yet in the end, a decision would have to be made."

When she noticed the report on Twilight's table she sighed, recognizing the investigation into E.L.F. conduct during the war that recently had been put together. "I'm guessing you have things you want to tell us?"\n\n"I have," Twilight nodded. "I just don't know how. After reading this, there's no way I can put in words just how amazed I am by you two."\n\n"Wait, what?" Trixie asked, blinking.

"I was desperate, and convinced it was the only way to save the situation. You were desperate too, maybe even more than I was. I could lecture you all day about details, but everything in here... there were so many times where you could have thrown principles overboard, and yet you stuck to them to the bitter end.

It wasn't that she was struggling with the conflicting emotions of on one hoof knowing why they had done the things they did, and the other this sudden shame when war no longer provided convenient excuses and they had to face down what they did. Had it all actually been necessary? Or had she just grasped for a simple solution? And of course, how would they ever know?\n\n"The Griffons have this belief in divine judgement," Blueblood began after a while. "They believe that the things you do in life will be weighed in the afterlife. Regular griffs are merely mortal and at the mercy of the gods' judgement. All you can do is you best with what you have and know. If you truly believe in something, commit to it and let the gods judge you at the end of it all."\n\n"Must be nice," Trixie muttered.

The garrisons, who had exhibited such brutality in their policing of the past weeks, were strangely quiescent and docile, even as curfew-breaking Resistance members, emboldened by the obfuscating fog, engaged in petty skirmishes with Changeling checkpoints and patrols. For a while, it seemed that the suffocating mist that had descended on Fillydelphia and Albion both had revitalised the Resistance, the opaque veil of whiteness offering a cosy anonymity to dissidents and criminals alike.\n\nIn the weeks to follow, though, the ponies of the Resistance would be wishing that the dense, ephemeral fog they had grown to like would instead be replaced by the billowing clouds of Changeling tear gas deployed in Manehattan. Changeling jaegers, shrouded in riot gear and gas masks, preyed on anypony who dared stay out on the streets past the curfew. Often, the unlucky target would not see their pursuers' approach until they emerged wraith-like from the milky fog, swinging their trucheons. Plucky members of the Resistance checking in on safe houses and hideouts reported them missing their inhabitants, food half-eaten on the tables and the nebulous fog creeping in from opened windows. Ponies venturing outdoors at night courted the risk of being taken by the many Changeling snatch-squads lurking within the fog. Their families dreaded something else entirely - that something wearing the face of their loved ones would return home in their stead.\n\nNo members of the Central Resistance Committee in Albion have been seen for the past week, dead nor alive. In Fillydelphia, rumours abound of an absentee leadership clandestinely smuggled across the sea to Griffonia, leaving behind the shattered and demoralised remnants of a resistance.

MAN_scripted_loc_for_four_unique_uprising_event_texts_1:0 "Resentment is a powerful force. Some say empires fall to the sword, or to famine, or to poor leadership. But more often than not, it is pure petty resentment which dooms them.\n\nLocals on the outskirts of the great Manehattan metropolitan area have begun openly harassing Protectorate personnel. So far, these clashes have been minor, with no deaths and the worst of it being broken windows and broken bones. But the possibility of petty street fighting turning into true general insurrection keeps our officers up at night."
MAN_scripted_loc_for_four_unique_uprising_event_texts_2:0 "What we thought was dockside griffon gangs vandalizing local structures has become something far worse. ELF symbology is everywhere, and no amount of propaganda can paint over this. A patrol of Constabulary were attacked while investigating the reports by well placed sniper fire, and then ambushed repeatedly as they fled back to their base. There were survivors, but their story swept away any relief at their survival. These were no gangbangers. They were drilled and zealous irregulars. The rebels have put their actions where their words have been 'till now, and what they lack in discipline they have made up for in zeal and sound tactics."
MAN_scripted_loc_for_four_unique_uprising_event_texts_3:0 "What began as grumblings of discontent on the fringes of the great Manehattan metropolis have taken deep root in the heart of the city. Starlight Glimmer and Trixie Lulamoon, the architects of a seemingly-inevitable revolution, are spoken of in every household. Hooligans spray paint their names on walls, evading capture or drawing the officers of the Protectress' law into ambush."
MAN_scripted_loc_for_four_unique_uprising_event_texts_4:0 "This is a disaster. This whole thing is an unmitigated disaster. The Protectress, whether through her own negligence or the Hegemony's failure to adequately supply her, has let the homegrown resistance go from a few dozen malcontents making up codes in someone's studio apartment to a wide-spread insurgency with perhaps a few thousand soldiers.\n\nThey are everywhere. They often go without uniforms or any marking of their allegience, blending in perfectly with the populace. They were rumors once, but now they are undeniably real. Their agents firebomb our garrison outposts and make threats towards our collaborators. Even some of the Changeling settlers are becoming sympathetic, with reports of Thoraxian rhetoric now rampant among our imported hivemates. Things are not hopeless yet. But these problems require hard choices, sacrifice, and a degree of luck to solve. May Chrysalis, or indeed, Celestia, help us."
MAN_scripted_loc_for_four_unique_uprising_event_texts_5:0 "Another battle in the streets today, as ELF improvised explosives knock a large armored vehicle on its side. The driver was knocked unconscious, and his passengers fought valiantly to keep their cargo safe. Unfortunately, by the time our wing of jaegers arrived to relieve them, the guerilla fighters had vanished along with sensitive intel and a VIP captive.\n\nEvery day, Manehattan rebels disrupt our activities and deny us easy access to our own territory. The collaborator bureaucracy fostered by the Protectress to help smooth out her administration is in shambles. The pony Constabulary is hemorrhaging personnel as deserters flee the city ahead of a certain rebel victory. Our loyal soldiers hold their fortifications as best they can, but even they begin to worry that salvation isn't coming."
MAN_scripted_loc_for_four_unique_uprising_event_texts_6:0 "Terror in the streets today as a squadron of Changeling soldiers under no orders torch a tenement building, with predictable consequences.\n\nDrunk, belligerent, and missing their pay for the week, these reprobates roughed up several of our subjects before plundering a discount liquor store and setting it on fire with some of the proprietor's own stock. The building was quickly consumed by flame, and with it the home and lives of hundreds.\n\nThe soldiers' names have not been released, and furious mobs hound the offices and garrisons of the Protectorate. Vigilantes bent on revenge lynch any Changeling or collaborationist unlucky enough to be caught out on the streets, and as news of the Changeling atrocity spreads across the Protectorate, so does the pony violence.\n\nLysia is furious, but even she is at a loss at how to proceed. Punish the officers? Because she can't find out a single Chrysalis-damned name! The idiots involved are being protected by their fellows and no one is talking.\n\nThe disciplinary action can wait for now. Lysia calls the Ost-Kommando to war as the fires of rebellion roil the East Coast once more."

The first vehicle was to be armed with anti-tank gun and two machine guns and the second one was to be a support vehicle armed with a larger calibre gun. The first one eventually became known as Panzerkampfwagen III, which was to be a standard tank for the three light companies of a tank battalion. The second one became known as Panzerkampfwagen IV."

MAN_medium_tank_equipment_2:0 "Panzerkampfwagen IV"
MAN_medium_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "Designed as an infantry-support tank, the Panzer IV was not originally intended to engage enemy armour - that function was performed by the lighter Panzer III. However, with the flaws of pre-war doctrine becoming apparent and in the face of Stalliongradian T-34 tanks, the Panzer IV soon assumed the tank-fighting role of its increasingly obsolete cousin. The most widely manufactured and deployed Changeling tank, the Panzer IV was used as the base for many other fighting vehicles."

MAN_medium_tank_equipment_3:0 "Panzerkampfwagen V Panther"
MAN_medium_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Panther is the common name of a medium tank deployed by Changelings from mid-1014. It was intended as a counter to the Stalliongradian T-34, and as a replacement for the Panzer III and Panzer IV. While never replacing the latter, it served alongside the heavier Tiger tank. The Panther's excellent combination of firepower, mobility, and protection served as a benchmark for other nations' late war and post-war tank designs, and it is regarded as one of the best tanks ever created."

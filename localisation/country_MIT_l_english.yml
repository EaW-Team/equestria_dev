 # Reclaimed Land
 MIT_historic_claims:0 "Operation Odysseus"
 MIT_historic_claims_desc:0 "After decades of planning the time has come to finally launch Operation Odysseus, the reconquering of the last four states of the old Asterion Confederation still under foreign occupation. The whole of the nation is dedicated to this one task, when it is finally complete we will be able to move on with the rest of our issues."
 MIT_begin_CYA_reintergration:0 "Restore the Asterion Mainland"
 MIT_begin_CYA_reintergration_desc:0 "At long last we have reclaimed our mainland states. For over a century our people have dreamt of this, and now that dream has come true. However, much as changed in our absence, and much of it has not been for the better. It's time to get to work."
 MIT_excecute_nobility:0 "Capital Punishment for the Nobility"
 MIT_excecute_nobility_desc:0 "For decades the so called nobility of the wicked County of Cyanolisia despoiled and pillaged the land. The time has come for them to pay for their crimes, and only one sentence is appropriate to punish them most severly."
 MIT_nobility_exile:0 "Exile the Nobility"
 MIT_nobility_exile_desc:0 "Our people have been shocked by the horrors of the mainland, and by the contemptible behavior of the so called nobility. However, we can not bring their crimes to a true account, and therefore the best and most politically expedient answer is to exile them. They shall go in peace, and never return."
 MIT_nobility_forgiveness:0 "The Hardest Choice"
 MIT_nobility_forgiveness_desc:0 "The crimes committed against the people of the mainland states by the nobility placed over them by The Empire are incalculable. We can not therefore assign specific blame, and so we must come to the hardest decision anyone can make. We must forgive them, and allow them to go free. They shall never again hold power, but life on the bottom is still life."
 MIT_uproot_institutions:0 "Reinstitute Asterionese Governance"
 MIT_uproot_institutions_desc:0 "Now that the mainland is back under the control of our people after so many years in the dark and our government's direction is decided, it's time to transition from military occupation of the mainland to normal governance. This will be a long process, but it will be nothing compared to the years of vassalage."
 MIT_core_auropallieta:0 "Reintegrate Auropallieta"
 MIT_core_auropallieta_desc:0 "During the unlawful occupation, the farmlands of Auropallieta were home to many resistance cells which fiercely fought against the imperialists and monarchists. They have welcomed us with open arms and are ready to rejoin Asterion proper."
 MIT_core_cannabia:0 "Reintegrate Cannabia"
 MIT_core_cannabia_desc:0 "Once one of the wealthiest states in Asterion, Cannabia's historical careful management of resources was thrown out the window by the Vassalage. While some might despair, there is still life in those jungles, still minerals in those hills, still some souls left to carry on. The people need only be reminded of what they still have, and what they can get back."
 MIT_core_salmarkt:0 "Reintegrate Salmarkt"
 MIT_core_salmarkt_desc:0 "Salmarkt has long been at the intersection of cultures, mainly of Asterionese and Prywhenian, but for even longer it was a core part of Asterion. It's time to remind the people of that fact."
 MIT_core_thym:0 "The Nest of Vipers"
 MIT_core_thym_desc:0 "Thymíaushafen was the capital of the Imperial occupation, and much was done to "griffonise" it. Temples of the old pantheon were torn down, Actualist philosophers were imprisoned or executed. Hundreds of thousands of griffons immigrated into the city and its surrounding area from all across the Empire. The scars of Néachóra, as it was once known, are the deepest ones. Healing them will be difficult..."
 MIT_core_creeper_mountains:0 "Reintegrate the Creeper Mountains"
 MIT_core_creeper_mountains_desc:0 "The Creeper Mountain state was the furthest inland the old Asterionese Confederation ever got, and the minotaurs who lived there were a hearty group, bravely guarding the frontier of Asterion from foreign invaders. Years of Imperial plundering of the mines followed by occupation by a bandit army has left the land in ruins. The minotaurs who remain greet us with open arms as liberators, and it is our duty to aid them."
 MIT_cannabia_buildings:0 "Tame The Jungle"
 MIT_cannabia_buildings_desc:0 "Now that Cannabia is once again part of Asterion officially we can begin the process of restoring the region to its former glory. Mass deforestation and draining of marshes will allow local towns and farms to expand, bringing civilization to a place that had lost it."
 MIT_minotaurian_mainland:0 "Asterion Reunited"
 MIT_minotaurian_mainland_desc:0 "After much time and effort the nation is once again whole. Recognition of this will pass not with the bang of celebration, but with the soft whimper of citizens sleeping soundly in their beds. They're finally back home, and nothing will ever change that."
 MIT_creeper_buildings:0 "Creeper Mountains Army Base"
 MIT_creeper_buildings_desc:0 "Since the Creeper Mountains are a natural defensive position it only makes sense for the military to purchase building rights there and establish a military base dedicated to arms production, utilizing local strategic resources."
 MIT_auropallieta_buildings:0 "Invest In Auropallieta"
 MIT_auropallieta_buildings_desc:0 "Due to the nearby border with Sicameon it only makes sense to invest in Auropallieta which can benefit from trade with our neighbour. Cyanolisia neglected the region for decades so they need all the help they can get to get back on their hooves."
 MIT_salmarkt_buildings:0 "Salmarkt Arms Production"
 MIT_salmarkt_buildings_desc:0 "As the crossroads of civilization it only makes sense for Salmarkt to have a military presence, especially considering its strategic location. Local economy will be redirected to supply the Asterionese army."

 # Militery
 MIT_escort_construction:0 "Purchase Civilian Shipyards"
 MIT_escort_construction_desc:0 "As the time for retaking the mainland grows ever closer we must enlarge military ship production to provide the escorts and fire support needed for a successful amphibious assault. Purchases of civilian shipyards will allow for the facilitation of this once the shipyards have been properly converted."
 MIT_joint_military_command:0 "Joint Military Command"
 MIT_joint_military_command_desc:0 "We have always been a nation of many islands for our entire history, and ever since we lost our mainland to the opressors this has been even more true.

 MIT_develop_submarines:0 "Develop Underwater Vessels"
 MIT_develop_submarines_desc:0 "In the recent age we have entered a new phase in the naval war, where being unseen is becoming more and more advantagous as new technology is developed. Many of our neighbors have embraced this and it is time we follow suit. We must develop our own submarine force."
 MIT_modern_escort_ships:0 "Latest Escort Ship Designs"
 MIT_modern_escort_ships_desc:0 "In order to secure civilian shipping as well as troop and supply movements over water we must keep our escort craft up to date and combat ready."

 MIT_deep_water_navy_desc:0 "Oour navy will focus on operating in the deepest waters of southern Griffonia, and therefore we should put our effort towards building the biggest ship we can."
 MIT_shallow_cove_ships:0 "Shallow Sea Navy"
 MIT_shallow_cove_ships_desc:0 "We should try to be realistic with ourselves, we don't have the industry to support a high seas fleet, and instead we should focus our effort on being the best in our regional seas."
 MIT_our_sea:0 "Ti Thálassa Mas"
 MIT_our_sea_desc:0 "We are a maritime nation and we are proud to be! We shall never bown down before the naval guns of opression before at least answering them with our own! We own this sea and all must know of the Asterion pride!"
 MIT_expand_the_MCG:0 "Expand the ACG"
 MIT_expand_the_MCG_desc:0 "For decades the Asterion Coast Guard has been the sword arm of the nation's anti-piracy operations. The image of guardsbulls leading the charge into pirate ships to rescue slaves and clean up the sapient garbage of the sea is an enduring image in the culture of Asterion. Expanding the organization will no doubt help preparations for the upcoming reclamation."
 MIT_amphibious_operations:0 "ACG Expertise"
 MIT_amphibious_operations_desc:0 "The ACG is the oldest active arm of the Asterionese military, and they have undertaken many amphibious operations It only makes sense then to plumb the depths of their experience to ensure that the liberation of our separated mainland states goes smoothly."
 MIT_smokeless_powder:0 "Smokeless Powder"
 MIT_smokeless_powder_desc:0 "For many years now smokeless powder has been the standard propellent of almost every single firearms cartridge in civilian hands, but the standard infantry weapons of the military have yet to advance in the time since the Fall of The Empire and the succession wars that followed. It's time for the continuing resolution and deadlocked committees to end. The military needs modern firearms, and it needs them now."
 MIT_army_doctrine:0 "Update the Army Doctrine"
 MIT_army_doctrine_desc:0 "The time of the Restoration War is long past, but experts from that war are still among us. Using the expertise of the famous Elite Four the ground combat doctrines currently in use shall be revolutionized into a new way of fighting. The oppressors won't know what hit them."
 MIT_armoured_development:0 "Armoured Vehicle Development"
 MIT_armoured_development_desc:0 "Recently the Coast Guard has seized an illigal weapons trade seemingly headed for Gryphus coming from some port near Sicameon, interestingly though this shipment contained several armored vehicles that we can put to use be reverse engineering them for our military purposes."
 MIT_modernise_artillery_guns:0 "Modernized Artillery"
 MIT_modernise_artillery_guns_desc:0 "For too long our artillery corps has been left our of the greater picture, though with the stiffening position of many of our opponents in our region our generals are starting to see the advantages of a powerful artillery force, and have begun to petition for more funds to be granted to this research."
 MIT_weapon_development_fund:0 "Arms Development Fund"
 MIT_weapon_development_fund_desc:0 "With newer larger armies hitting the field across Griffonia, every day we see examples of how mass mobalization will be needed on a scale never before concieved. Part of this is the mobalization of materials of war, we can set up a special government body for the specific purpose of streamlining the process of manufacturing and delivering basic weapons to all of our soldiers."
 MIT_motor_infantry:0 "Motorised Infantry"
 MIT_motor_infantry_desc:0 "With the new 'automobiles' proving their worth in the private sector every day it's time we capitalize on them for the Asterionese military. Since the minotaurs that make up the majority of the troops don't have flight or magic manipulation mechanization will more than make up for any shortcomings."
 MIT_top_cover:0 "Top Cover"
 MIT_top_cover_desc:0 "With the Asterionese Air Force becoming more of a reality every day it's time for those valiant pilots to have homes to call their own. These new bases will greatly help us in the upcoming operation."
 MIT_paratroopers_focus:0 "Airborne Divisions"
 MIT_paratroopers_focus_desc:0 "The importation of a simple safety device for aircraft called a parachute has led our military planners to a startling conclusion. By giving these parachutes to soldiers and their equipment entire armies would be able to be inserted behind enemy lines to sow confusion. Should a sea landing become unviable these daring bulls of action will become invaluable."
 MIT_aircraft_supplies:0 "Synthetic Resources"
 MIT_aircraft_supplies_desc:0 "Whether they run on crystals, petroleum, or one of the more exotic power sources it is undeniable that aircraft require many resources to run that are just not found in sufficient numbers in Asterion. Therefore we must create our own supplies out of the resources we do have available."
 MIT_found_the_aaf:0 "Found The AAF"
 MIT_found_the_aaf_desc:0 "While we have generally been at the forefront of Naval innovation for a long time, we have lagged behind in developing technology for the skies. Currently the only thing that we have that could pass for an air force are a few reconnaissance aircraft and a griffon who thinks he is a Minotaur. Because of this we should now endevour to found an official airforce branch of our military to serve in the skies."
 MIT_local_air_development:0 "Local Aircraft Development"
 MIT_local_air_development_desc:0 "While the stratagies of other nations for importing foreign plans and then copying them is an ok idea, we Minotaurs prefer to do things our own way, also we can't fit in any cockpits of imported aircraft. Time to do it our own way!"
 MIT_close_air_support:0 "Close Air Support"
 MIT_close_air_support_desc:0 "While an airforce is great working independently to strike the foctories or supplies of our enemies, we must not forget that the army are still fighting a war on the ground. We shall develop craft capable of supporting our boys and girls on the ground!"
 MIT_strategic_bomber_development:0 "Acquire Strategic Bomber Designs"
 MIT_strategic_bomber_development_desc:0 "While shooting enemy soldiers from the sky is cool it is also important to note that they can be replaced and will still have weapons to fire back at us. To remedy this we must develop Aircraft for the sole purpose of striking at enemy industrial and population centers."
 MIT_develop_air_theory:0 "A Doctrine For Aerial Warfare"
 MIT_develop_air_theory_desc:0 "We have summoned together the greatest pilots and theorists of our nation to decide on a way to execute our war in the skies, we are sure their conclusion will be the correct one."
 MIT_advanced_fighter_designs:0 "Advanced Fighter Designs"
 MIT_advanced_fighter_designs_desc:0 "Now that we have decided on our doctrine for our airforce it is time to once more focus on general air design. The fighter is indispensable for any airforce and we must once again improve the quality of ours."

 MIT_jet_engine_development:0 "Jet Engine Experiments"
 MIT_jet_engine_development_desc:0 "In our new airforce testing facilities an interesting idea has been circling amongst the engineers. The idea to propel an aircraft directly using fuel instead of a propeller, while this reality is most likely still far away, it is a concept that might be good to entertain."
 MIT_naval_aircraft:0 "Naval Aircraft"
 MIT_naval_aircraft_desc:0 "Now that we have founded and modernize our airforce, we have recieved a letter signed by all our top admirals asking for the development of aircraft meant specifically to strike at targets on the sea, this would surely cement our control over the waves through the use of air power."


 #industry
 MIT_national_accountability_programme:0 "National Accountability Program"

 MIT_civil_works_corps:0 "Initiate Public Works Projects"
 MIT_civil_works_corps_desc:0 "No matter how successful our alliance with the corporate giants has been, they have begun to control to much at time. We can work to counterbalance this by estblishing state public works to subsidize and support the lower classes."
 MIT_raido_development:0 "Adopt The Radio"
 MIT_raido_development_desc:0 "By way of ships from skyfall arrives a new technoloy, the radio and its brother the RADAR. The government has been quick to buy up many of these radios and are begin to asses their usefulness for us, and as a nation of islands, it seems like it will work well."

 MIT_legacy_of_asterionian_industry_desc:0 "For generations we have stood proud, even while under yoke we fought with everything we had and with that came the need for innovation. Though now we have fallen behind other nations in regards to industry and the like, it is time to once more move to the forefront of a new age in manufacturing!"
 MIT_light_industry:0 "Light Industry Subsidies"
 MIT_light_industry_desc:0 "Signing contracts with new start up factories around our territories is a great way to get our industrial base going."
 MIT_mainland_rail_network:0 "Mainland Rail Network"
 MIT_mainland_rail_network_desc:0 "In order to draw on the full wealth of our island we must be able to transport across it, and for that to occur we must construct new rail lines to further the connectedness of our nation."
 MIT_modern_society:0 "A Modern Asterion"
 MIT_modern_society_desc:0 "At last we have pulled ourselves forth, out from under the rock of ignorance and into the new age. And so shall Aterion set forth, new, modern, and free!"
 
 MIT_review_navy_budget:0 "Review Navy Budget"
 MIT_review_navy_budget_desc:0 "The time has come to focus the two houses of the Voulí on the task of addressing the military budgets long held in limbo. First up shall be the navy budget.

 MIT_new_rnd:0 "Open New Research and Development Facility"
 MIT_new_rnd_desc:0 "The current facilities for research are stellar, but limited by space. By building a new wing onto the complex we shall allow for more technologies to be researched simultaneously. Consequently, the overall speed of research will increase."
 MIT_start_healing:0 "Bridge Internal Divides"
 MIT_start_healing_desc:0 "Now that the land is once more whole we must start to do the same for the people. For years the population has seen itself divided along every possible line. No more."
 MIT_economic_law:0 "Revise General Military Spending"
 MIT_economic_law_desc:0 "With the world becoming ever more dangerous it is time we dealt with the issue of military spending. By moving to a higher state of mobilization we will be able to make better use of our already existing concrete factories, along with several other benefits."
 MIT_building_slots1:0 "Continued Urbanisation"
 MIT_building_slots1_desc:0 "As the largest of the islands in the Asterion Archipelago, Kainourgio Spiti has a great amount of land usable for agriculture and mining, and as a result it has a relatively low urbanisation rate despite its large cities. By providing public jobs and building afforable housing, we can encourage further urban expansion."
 MIT_building_slots3:0 "Expand the Military-Industrial Complex"
 MIT_building_slots3_desc:0 "We have already benefited greatly from our army's close ties to our defence industry. We shall approve increased military spending and sign additional contracts with arms companies, to further increase production of equipment."
 MIT_building_slots2:0 "Island Investment"
 MIT_building_slots2_desc:0 "There are many many small islands in the Asterion Archipelago, with many being grouped in larger states. Many of them have small populations and thus small economies. By investing in each of the states not on the mainland or Kainourgio Spiti we shall spread out our wealth more equally across the nation."
 MIT_island_rnd:0 "LabCom"
 MIT_island_rnd_desc:0 "The many islands of the archipelago have equally as many schools, universities, and singular scientific laboratories. By setting up a system for these disconnected research centers to communicate and collaborate we shall greatly increase our capacity for research. Coincidently, there are a number of military testing grounds that shall be integrated into the system."
 MIT_building_slots4:0 "Archipelago Expansion"
 MIT_building_slots4_desc:0 "While the mainland states are still being restored to their former glory the states in the Home Islands are still ripe for military development. The plan for this expansion is simple: one state, one plot of land. This shall surely be a massive boon to our fighting capability once all plots are fully operational."
 MIT_foreign_legion:0 "Asterion Foreign Legion"
 MIT_foreign_legion_desc:0 "There are many people across the globe who long to be part of the Asterionese way of life. To service these poor downtrodden we should establish a military unit made up entirely of perspective citizens.

 MIT_main_rnd:0 "Kókkino Mountain Complex"
 MIT_main_rnd_desc:0 "Kókkino Mountain might not be the largest mountain in the state of Ketta, but its unique and recently classified structure allows it to have a very valuable purpose for our war efforts; the inside can be hollowed out and filled with a heavily armored research complex. This shall allow us conduct all manner of research in secret without destroying the countryside."
 MIT_expand_rubber_plantations:0 "Expand Rubber Plantations"
 MIT_expand_rubber_plantations_desc:0 "Rubber has long been the primary export of Asterion. This is partly due to Imperial investment in the plantations, which meant that most of the produce was confiscated in the name of the Emperor to supply their own economy. But now that we are free, the plantations belong to us and so do their profits. We should plant even more rubber trees and become the rubber capital of Griffonia."
 MIT_building_slots_continuous:0 "Import Foreign Machinery"
 MIT_building_slots_continuous_desc:0 "After years of slavery under the Empire we have fallen behind many countries in the world that have, in the meantime, become quite advanced.

 MIT_political_effort:0 "Divided We Are Weak!"
 MIT_political_effort_desc:0 "The squabbling and disputes between the Unity party and the increasingly popular Fascio-Communist coalition must end! We are getting distracted from our main duty: Retaking our lost lands, liberating our race and safeguarding our freedom at any cost. If we keep arguing, unable to have a single, shared vision of the future, we will crumble and once again become slaves."

 MIT_coalition_victory:0 "Fascio-Communist Victory!"
 MIT_coalition_victory_desc:0 "Many said it couldn't be done, but the unified coalition of the fascists and the communists have finally secured an electoral majority.

 MIT_creeper_mountains:0 "Negotiate For Our Lands"
 MIT_creeper_mountains_desc:0 "Now that the Imperialist oppressors have been disposed of it's time to secure the rest of our states which were lost during our subjugation.

 MIT_collective_construction:0 "Collective Construction"
 MIT_collective_construction_desc:0 "To allow for the construction of the immense bulwark that will keep the collective masses of Asterion safe from imperialist scum, sacrifices will have to be made.

 MIT_antiaircraft_artillery:0 "Air Defense Network"
 MIT_antiaircraft_artillery_desc:0 "But what about the possibility of an air attack? When the anti-minotaur conspirators come we will have an answer for that question: A vast defence network of anti-aircraft guns, ready to shoot down any foolish pilot to enter our airspace."

 MIT_artificial_magic:0 "Synthetic Crystals"
 MIT_artificial_magic_desc:0 "Magic crystals can store a great amount of power in them. It is becoming increasingly clear to us that they can be used for all kinds of purposes.

 MIT_democratic_victory_desc:0 "After many debates and a swiftly prepared election, the Unity Party has emerged victorious!

 MIT_democratic_alliance:0 "Formalize the CFN"
 MIT_democratic_alliance_desc:0 "In recent years there has been a movement to formalize our alliance with our democratic amigos in Sicameon to allow for military and logistic cooperation. In a world filled with monarchs, dictators, and evil wizards, it is argued, the free peoples of the world need to band together for defense against those who would see them as slaves. The Concordat of Free Nations will evolve to become that band, and together we happy few shall make the world safe for liberty."

 MIT_civilian_citizenship_status:0 "Asterionese Citizen Soldiers"
 MIT_civilian_citizenship_status_desc:0 "We can not rely on agrivated conscripts or brutish thugs to field in the ranks of our armies. No. Instead we must make our nation proud by fighting with only the greatest citizen soldiers for the defense of our nation. And with freedom and prestige on the line, we know many will accept the offer to join."
 MIT_end_martial_law:0 "End Martial Law"
 MIT_end_martial_law_desc:0 "For too long this nation has been ruled with an iron fist not unlike that of a dictator, despite being a proud republic. This must change. We shall reinstate the civilian law code and assure the stability of the nation returns."
 MIT_arsenal_of_democracy:0 "The Arsenal of Democracy"
 MIT_arsenal_of_democracy_desc:0 "To build a weapon for the subjugation of another is a crime, to build a weapon for the liberation of hundreds of thousands? That, is a victory in itself."
 MIT_oni:0 "Office of Nonstandard Interventions"
 MIT_oni_desc:0 "With the world becoming ever more dangerous we are faced with an uncomfortable truth which we can deny no longer - tyranny prevails in most of the world. To counteract it and encourage the spread of democracy we shall establish an intelligence agency to affect change in foreign countries. Basil Zacharias shall be the first head of this agency."
 MIT_expeditionary_forces:0 "Asterionese Ground and Air Expeditionary Force"
 MIT_expeditionary_forces_desc:0 "With more under the table methods of liberation now firmly established it's time we deployed our forces in a more public manner.

 MIT_remote_nation_building:0 "Remote Nation Building"
 MIT_remote_nation_building_desc:0 "By making friends we gain two victories; gaining an ally against the Empire, and stopping the Imperials from gaining an ally. When those allies are strong it's even better. It's time we went about building up our friends, the enemies of our enemy."

 MIT_SIC_assistance:0 "Concordat Research Directorate"
 MIT_SIC_assistance_desc:0 "Now that the CFN has been solidified as a military alliance it behooves us to be on equal footing with our allies. Setting up the CoRD will allow us and our beloved friends to fight side by side without the issues that come with disparate technology levels."
 MIT_trade_federation_friendship:0 "Trade Federation Friendship"
 MIT_trade_federation_friendship_desc:0 "The Skyfall Trade Federation has long been a bastion of democracy, commerce, and naval prowess, much like us. It only makes sense then to approach them about joining the Concordat of Free Nations. If they decide to decline, as they are most likely to do, then we can at least establish good trading relations and lay the groundwork for future anti-piracy endeavours."
 MIT_town_friendship:0 "Operation Outstretched Hand"
 MIT_town_friendship_desc:0 "The FToG has been an ally of Asterion in the past, with sailors from both nations cooperating with each other. It appears that some things have changed, however, and so it would be best to send a formal inquiry. If they still stand by democracy, then they should be invited to the CFN. If they have fallen to imperialism or anarchy, then we shall intervene."
 MIT_command_council:0 "Concordat Command Council"
 MIT_command_council_desc:0 "As forces from different nations in the CFN continue to fight alongside each other the need for a unified command at the strategic level becomes more clear. By setting up a council of war we can prevent further incidents like what happened with our sailors and the Sicameonese marines back in '02. We're still playing back that family for what happened to their penguins."
 MIT_coalition_trade:0 "Concordat Free Trade Agreement"

 MIT_coalition_immigration:0 "Concordat Work Visa"
 MIT_coalition_immigration_desc:0 "As the need for military contractors to travel through different nations to do their jobs increases the paperwork involved also increases. By issuing a visa that is accepted by all CFN member states to those individuals deemed worthy of the privilege of free movement we can greatly reduce overhead costs. As a side effect, member states might see slight increases in their working populations."
 MIT_coalition_exchange_students:0 "CFN Cadet Exchange Program"
 MIT_coalition_exchange_students_desc:0 "Each of the militaries of the Concordat brings something unique and interesting to the table, not only in terms of material but also in terms of tradition and tactics.

 MIT_pirate_hunting:0 "Protect The Free State"
 MIT_pirate_hunting_desc:0 "The Kása Free State has stood long as a haven of liberty, where escaped slaves and serfs can live free from oppression and imperialism. Their benefactors in Macawia are distant, so it only makes sense if we promise to aid them in time of need against any foreign aggression."
 MIT_operation_edelweiss:0 "Operation Moly"
 MIT_operation_edelweiss_desc:0 "Now that the coast has been secured the full extent of crimes in the Magocracy of Barrad has been discovered. These horrors can not be allowed to continue, so we must intervene."

In stark contrast, the bull's political career has been disastrous. His staunch supporter of Enotita - especially its more militant wing - paints him as a firm supporter of country's current course. But his outright xenophobia, as well as visible support of old, obscure beliefs and faiths puts him really low on popularity lists. \n\nPerhaps, he would be better off with the Fascio-Communist Coalition, but the general harshly pushed away their invites, as he considers them hostile elements, that "push back the glorious day of mainland reclamation". These factors combined make a decorated general, one of the most brilliant military minds of modern Asterion... a laughingstock of country's political scene.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Scroup"

The announcement that the mainland has been reclaimed. All patriotic minotaurs will remember this day for the rest of their lives. They will remember how the oppressive griffons cowered in their corrupted cities, and how in the countryside their minotaur comrades welcomed the armies with open arms.

What about the thefts of our treasures and resources? All those crimes remains unpunished. No more.\n\nThe asterionese people called for blood and blood they shall have. The asterionise government has declared that for their deeds, all captured or free cyanolisian holder of any noble title will be executed.\n\nThere will be international outcry.

Among the priority issues is the fate of the cyanolisian nobility. Many have called for radical answers to the fate of the nobility but in the end, cooler heads prevailed. We knew they couldn't remain but we also understood that the soul of our reunited Asterion would forever be tarnished if we indulged in bloodshed.\n\nAfter long debates, the Epanapatrismós Edict was enacted. All griffon holders of any nobility title, their households and inseparable associates would be repatriated to any griffon-majority land of their choosing. They would be allowed to leave without harm and with their basic necessities. However, all objects of value, assets and properties would be nationalized. A period of a four days would be given after which they would be forcibly removed from our territory. The edict also includes exceptions for all nobles closely associated to the state apparatus for prosecution and individuals deemed essential for the reconstruction."

Some radicals were asking for increasingly harsh measures against them, calling any compromise tantamount to treason. The moderates, of course, balked at the attack and called them insane in return. Even [Root.GetLeader] had lost control of the room, incapable of making a final decision.\n\nThen, a cane struck the floor, imposing silence after a few knocks. All heads turned to the end of the table. There sat an old minotaur, the discrete minister of veteran affairs. The fact he commanded silence to the meeting was surprising enough in itself but not as much as the very fact he wished to intervene. The discussion going nowhere, [Root.GetLeader] gave him the floor. He stood up to speak.\n\n"My friends. For centuries, the griffons have humiliated us and now, even in defeat, they sow discord among us. Is this how low we have fallen?" He took a long breath, looking at the map of Asterion hanged on the wall. He pointed at it with his cane.\n\nAsterion... Named after our legendary leader, Aster. He would be proud today, of all of you I'm sure, because you have restored the unity of our people. But let us take a moment to remember what he did. Enslaved by the Nimbusian, he did not seek bloodshed. He sought freedom for our people. He sought a higher fate for our people. You, me, all of us are his descendants and we all carry a little bit of him, that which allows us minotaurs to access a higher understanding of things. Let's not act as griffons or as ponies but as Asterioneses. I say we pardon them."\n\nSeveral ministers rose up in anger, the old minister unmoved. [Root.GetLeader] asked for silence. "Let him finish."\n\nThe old minister acquiesced. "Thank you. Now, I understand your concerns. But imagine them living among us, witness of all the glory of civilization has to offer. Forever incapable of ordering us around or forgetting that we rose above them when we could not have. Tell me my friends, wouldn't that be the greatest possible justice for their crimes?"

The lure of the radical parties parties has grown stronger in recent times, but the coalition between the fascists and communists may fracture should they emerge victorious. For now, they are united in their hatred of the status quo.\n\nThe Fascist party speaks of a greater Asterion that encompasses the land of many of our neighbors, and an ideology that seperates Minotaurs from Griffons, and North Griffons from South Griffons.\n\nThe Communists speak of a equal state of all Minotaurs and an end to the corporate dominance of our industry.\n\nAnd the Enótita still stick to their rhetoric of liberty and equality, with a sprinkle of nationalism thrown in.\n\nThe choice is now up to the people.

The fact is that the former capital of the Asterion mainland, now called Thymíaushafen, has been much more griffonized them we had originally expected, and now constitute a cultural majoriy. A cabinet meeting has been called to decide what to do.\n\nThe simplest option is to let it be and force the Griffons there to deal with Minotaur rule, but this means it will never be fully integrated.\n\nOption 2 speaks of exiling almost every griffon from the city to reestablish a minotaur majority.\n\nA third option, advocated by a small but vocal minority is to reach an agreement with a griffon administration in the city, and establishing a new "Free-State" government as a puppet regime."
 asterion.35.a:0 "The griffons can become second-class citizens."
 asterion.35.b:0 "Expel them all! Néachóra belongs to the minotaurs!"

We must now deal with this new population in our nation, and find some place to put them all."

 MIT_MAXIMIN_DESC:0 "Maximin was born in Cyanolisia in 973 to a family of serfs on a griffon-owned tobacco farm. In 982 his family fled to Asterion after the nation won its freedom in the Restoration War and lived there in poverty until Maximin accepted an offer to travel to Stalliongrad in 999, to study at the Steel Stallion International School of Communism. He returned to Asterion years later and was one of the founding members of the Kókkini Katharótita, quickly becoming its General Secretary."
 MIT_OPLI_DESC:0 "Konstantine Oplí was a lesser known officer in the Restoration War, but after victory was achieved he quickly worked his way up through the ranks and became a prodigy of Konstantinos Kondylis. Upon the former President's death, Oplí managed to secure his place as his master's successor and planned to continue many of his policies, however the prosperity and stability of the first few years of liberty were waning. The failure to liberate the mainland in the Restoration War and the Enótita's seeming lack of action against the griffon occupiers, along with its failure to deliver all promises made during the war has left to the party's popularity sliding. In an attempt to appease opposing factions, he allowed political exiles to return and has made promises of social reform. Never the less, he has vowed to continue the fight until all Southern Griffonia is free from tyranny."
 MIT_MAXIRY_DESC:0 "For years after the Restoration War, the liberal Enótita party dominated the political scene of Asterion, but now a new rival has entered the stage and taken their place in the spotlight. It is an unlikely and purely pragmatic coalition of the fascist Paliá Frourá and communist Kókkini Katharótita parties, for the leaders of the two, Andris Dóry and Maximin Kókkinos, knew they could only challenge the Enótita party by allying with each other. Now that they are in power however, many doubt the coalition will last long."
 MIT_DORY_DESC:0 "Born in Lóthar, Aetiea in 941, Andris joined the Asterionese Military Academy at an early age and joined the Imperial Army's auxiliary forces. During the collapse of the Empire he defected, returned to his homeland and became a leading general in the Restoration War, fighting bravely against the occupying forces. After the victory he became the Minister of Military Affairs. During the government of Konstantinos Kondylis, he was exiled to Wingbardy due to his Imperial connections. There he met with Beakolini and came to respect the griffon and his ideas of military governance. On his return to Asterion after Konstantinos Kondylis' death he founded the Fasístas Paliá Frourá, a party composed primarily of veterans of the Restoration War and nationalists."

 ### NATIONAL FOCUS ######

 MIT_historic_claims:0 "Operation Odysseus"
 MIT_historic_claims_desc:0 "After decades of planning the time has come to finally launch Operation Odysseus, the reconquering of the last four states of the old Asterion Confederation still under foreign occupation. The whole of the nation is dedicated to this one task, when it is finally complete we will be able to move on with the rest of our issues."
 MIT_begin_CYA_reintergration:0 "Restore the Asterion Mainland"
 MIT_begin_CYA_reintergration_desc:0 "At long last we have reclaimed our mainland states. For over a century our people have dreamt of this, and now that dream has come true. However, much as changed in our absence, and much of it has not been for the better. It's time to get to work."
 MIT_excecute_nobility:0 "Capital Punishment for the Nobility"
 MIT_excecute_nobility_desc:0 "For decades the so called nobility of the wicked County of Cyanolisia despoiled and pillaged the land. The time has come for them to pay for their crimes, and only one sentence is appropriate to punish them most severly."
 MIT_nobility_exile:0 "Exile the Nobility"
 MIT_nobility_exile_desc:0 "Our people have been shocked by the horrors of the mainland, and by the contemptible behavior of the so called nobility. However, we can not bring their crimes to a true account, and therefore the best and most politically expedient answer is to exile them. They shall go and peace, and never return."
 MIT_nobility_forgiveness:0 "The Hardest Choice"
 MIT_nobility_forgiveness_desc:0 "The crimes committed against the people of the mainland states by the nobility placed over them by The Empire are incalculable. We can not therefore assign specific blame, and so we must come to the hardest decision anyone can make. We must forgive them, and allow them to go free. They shall never again hold power, but life on the bottom is still life."
 MIT_uproot_institutions:0 "Reinstitute Asterionese Governance"
 MIT_uproot_institutions_desc:0 "Now that the mainland is back under the control of our people after so many years in the dark and our government's direction is decided, it's time to transition from military occupation of the mainland to normal governance. This will be a long process, but it will be nothing compared to the years of vassalage."
 MIT_core_auropallieta:0 "Reintegrate Auropallieta"
 MIT_core_auropallieta_desc:0 "During the unlawful occupation, the farmlands of Auropallieta were home to many resistance cells which fiercly fought against the imperialists and monarchists. They have welcomed us with open arms and are ready to rejoin Asterion proper."
 MIT_core_cannabia:0 "Reintegrate Cannabia"
 MIT_core_cannabia_desc:0 "Once one of the wealthiest states in Asterion, Cannabia's historical careful management of resources was thrown out the window by the Vassalage. While some might despair, there is still life in those jungles, still minerals in those hills, still some souls left to carry on. The people need only be reminded of what they still have, and what they can get back."
 MIT_core_salmarkt:0 "Reintegrate Salmarkt"
 MIT_core_salmarkt_desc:0 "Salmarkt has long been at the intersection of cultures, mainly of Asterionese and Prywhenian, but for even longer it was a core part of Asterion. It's time to remind the people of that fact."
 MIT_core_thym:0 "Reintegrate Néachóra"
 MIT_core_thym_desc:0 "Thymíaushafen was the capital of the Imperial occupation, and has had much done to change its infrastructure and population. Temples of the old pantheon were torn down, Actualist advocates were imprisoned, and democratic philosophers were executed. It's time to heal the land and its people of its wounds and eradicate traces of past oppression."
 MIT_core_creeper_mountains:0 "Reintegrate the Creeper Mountains"
 MIT_core_creeper_mountains_desc:0 "The Creeper Mountain state was the furthest inland the old Asterionese Confederation ever got, and the minotaurs who lived there were a hearty group, bravely guarding the frontier of Asterion from foreign invaders. Years of Imperial plundering of the mines followed by occupation by a bandit army has left the land in ruins. The minotaurs who remain greet us with open arms as liberators, and it is our duty to aid them."
 MIT_cannabia_buildings:0 "Tame The Jungle"
 MIT_cannabia_buildings_desc:0 "Now that Cannabia is once again part of Asterion officially we can begin the process of restoring the region to its former glory. Mass deforestation and draining of marshes will allow local towns and farms to expand, bringing civilization to a place that had lost it."
 MIT_minotaurian_mainland:0 "Asterion Reunited"
 MIT_minotaurian_mainland_desc:0 "After much time and effort the nation is once again whole. Recognition of this will pass not with the bang of celebration, but with the soft whimper of citizens sleeping soundly in their beds. They're finally back home, and nothing will ever change that."
 MIT_creeper_buildings:0 "Creeper Mountains Army Base"
 MIT_creeper_buildings_desc:0 "Since the Creeper Mountains are a natural defensive position it only makes sense for the military to purchase building rights there and establish a military base dedicated to arms production, utilizing local strategic resources."
 MIT_auropallieta_buildings:0 "Invest In Auropallieta"
 MIT_auropallieta_buildings_desc:0 "Due to the nearby border with Sicameon it only makes sense to invest in Auropallieta which can benefit from trade with our neighbour. Cyanolisia neglected the region for decades so they need all the help they can get to get back on their hooves."
 MIT_salmarkt_buildings:0 "Salmarkt Arms Production"
 MIT_salmarkt_buildings_desc:0 "As the crossroads of civilization it only makes sense for Salmarkt to have a military presence, especially considering its strategic location. Local economy will be redirected to supply the Asterionese army."

 MIT_escort_construction:0 "Purchase Civilian Shipyards"
 MIT_escort_construction_desc:0 "As the time for retaking the mainland grows ever closer we must enlarge military ship production to provide the escorts and fire support needed for a successful amphibious assault. Purchases of civilian shipyards will allow for the facilitation of this once the shipyards have been properly converted."

The image of guardsbulls leading the charge into pirate ships to rescue slaves and clean up the sapient garbage of the sea is an enduring image in the culture of Asterion. Expanding the organization will no doubt help preparations for the upcoming reclamation."
 MIT_amphibious_operations:0 "ACG Expertise"
 MIT_amphibious_operations_desc:0 "The ACG is the oldest active arm of the Asterionese military, and they have undertaken many amphibious operations It only makes sense then to plumb the depths of their experience to ensure that the liberation of our separated mainland states goes smoothly."
 MIT_smokeless_powder:0 "Smokeless Powder"
 MIT_smokeless_powder_desc:0 "For many years now smokeless powder has been the standard propellent of almost every single firearms cartridge in civilian hands, but the standard infantry weapons of the military have yet to advance in the time since the Fall of The Empire and the succession wars that followed. It's time for the continuing resolution and deadlocked committees to end. The military needs modern firearms, and it needs them now."
 MIT_army_doctrine:0 "Update the Army Doctrine"
 MIT_army_doctrine_desc:0 "The time of the Restoration War is long past, but experts from that war are still among us. Using the expertise of the famous Elite Four the ground combat doctrines currently in use shall be revolutionized into a new way of fighting. The oppressors won't know what hit them."

Since the minotaurs that make up the majority of the troops don't have flight or magic manipulation mechanization will more than make up for any shortcomings."
 MIT_top_cover:0 "Top Cover"
 MIT_top_cover_desc:0 "With the Asterionese Air Force becoming more of a reality every day it's time for those valiant pilots to have homes to call their own. These new bases will greatly help us in the upcoming operation."
 MIT_paratroopers_focus:0 "Airborne Divisions"
 MIT_paratroopers_focus_desc:0 "The importation of a simple safety device for aircraft called a parachute has led our military planners to a startling conclusion. By giving these parachutes to soldiers and their equipment entire armies would be able to be inserted behind enemy lines to sow confusion. Should a sea landing become unviable these daring bulls of action will become invaluable."
 MIT_aircraft_supplies:0 "Synthetic Resources"
 MIT_aircraft_supplies_desc:0 "Whether they run on crystals, petroleum, or one of the more exotic power sources it is undeniable that aircraft require many resources to run that are just not found in sufficient numbers in Asterion.

First up shall be the navy budget. With it addressed Asterion's pride can once more control the seas and protect the trade without pirate interference."
 MIT_new_rnd:0 "Open New Research and Development Facility"
 MIT_new_rnd_desc:0 "The current facilities for research are stellar, but limited by space. By building a new wing onto the complex we shall allow for more technologies to be researched simultaneously. Consequently, the overall speed of research will increase."
 MIT_start_healing:0 "Bridge Internal Divides"
 MIT_start_healing_desc:0 "Now that the land is once more whole we must start to do the same for the people. For years the population has seen itself divided along every possible line. No more."
 MIT_economic_law:0 "Revise General Military Spending"
 MIT_economic_law_desc:0 "With the world becoming ever more dangerous it is time we dealt with the issue of military spending. By moving to a higher state of mobilization we will be able to make better use of our already existing concrete factories, along with several other benefits."
 MIT_restart_the_air_force:0 "Restart the Air Force"
 MIT_restart_the_air_force_desc:0 "The Asterionese Air Force is the youngest of the service branches, and since its formation over a decade ago has languished with only a small number of aircraft and facilities. It's time to change all that with an actual budget for the service."
 MIT_review_army_budget:0 "Reform the Army Budget"
 MIT_review_army_budget_desc:0 "The grunt down in the muck is the bull taking and holding land, and it's been this way since time immemorial. However, modern war is far more complex than just infantry lines or even artillery. It's time the budget of the Asterionese Combined Land Army was revised to allow for the research and production of those new technologies."
 MIT_finish_healing:0 "Let This Be Our Last Battlefield"
 MIT_finish_healing_desc:0 "After years of political in-fighting and suspicion Asterion's people are finally at peace. No more shall they be at each other's throats over differences in class, religion, politics, or urbanization. The nation will now stand united and shout to the world with one voice, 'Death to monarchists!'"
 MIT_open_immigration:0 "Open Immigration Offices"
 MIT_open_immigration_desc:0 "Now that Asterion is back on her feet we can finally feel safe opening up the immigration offices. They will have to shed their old cultures to become Asterionese, but we are so confident in our culture that we doubt that absorbing them will be any problem."
 MIT_building_slots1:0 "Continued Urbanisation"
 MIT_building_slots1_desc:0 "As the largest of the islands in the Asterion Archipelago, Kainourgio Spiti has a great amount of land usable for agriculture and mining, and as a result it has a relatively low urbanisation rate despite its large cities. By providing public jobs and building afforable housing, we can encourage further urban expansion."
 MIT_building_slots3:0 "Expand Military-Industrial Complex"
 MIT_building_slots3_desc:0 "We have already benefited greatly from our army's close ties to our defence industry. We shall approve increased military spending and sign additional contracts with arms companies, to further increase production of equipment."
 MIT_big_island_immigration:0 "Kainourgio Spiti Immigration"
 MIT_big_island_immigration_desc:0 "Despite being the largest and longest inhabited island in the archipelago Kainourgio Spiti is rather sparsely populated. By giving incentives to people to move to the island we shall be able to increase the number of people in our manpower pool while enlarging our economy."
 MIT_building_slots2:0 "Island Real Estate"
 MIT_building_slots2_desc:0 "There are many many small islands in the Asterion Archipelago, with many being grouped in larger states. By purchasing at least one plot of land in each of the states not on the mainland or Kainourgio Spiti we shall spread out our operations enough that hopefully a single attack won't slow us down during war."
 MIT_island_immigration:0 "Encourage Migration To Islands"
 MIT_island_immigration_desc:0 "The islands of Asterion are a wonderful place to live. It's time we advertised that fact to the world, along with the pressing need for workers and fighters. Once we have made sure these new immigrants are ideologically pure and not Imperial spies they shall make great additions to the population."
 MIT_island_rnd:0 "LabCom"
 MIT_island_rnd_desc:0 "The many islands of the archipelago have equally as many schools, universities, and singular scientific laboratories. By setting up a system for these disconnected research centers to communicate and collaborate we shall greatly increase our capacity for research. Coincidently, there are a number of military testing grounds that shall be integrated into the system."
 MIT_building_slots4:0 "Archipelago Expansion"
 MIT_building_slots4_desc:0 "While the mainland states are still being restored to their former glory the states in the Home Islands are still ripe for military development. The plan for this expansion is simple: one state, one plot of land. This shall surely be a massive boon to our fighting capability once all plots are fully operational."
 MIT_foreign_legion:0 "Asterion Foreign Legion"
 MIT_foreign_legion_desc:0 "There are many people across the globe who long to be part of the Asterionese way of life. To service these poor downtrodden we should establish a military unit made up entirely of perspective citizens. Once proven to be ideologically pure they shall be able to join the military in Asterion, and take their families too. Service will guarantee citizenship for these hopefuls."
 MIT_main_rnd:0 "Kókkino Mountain Complex"
 MIT_main_rnd_desc:0 "Kókkino Mountain might not be the largest mountain in the state of Ketta, but its unique and recently classified structure allows it to have a very valuable purpose for our war efforts; the inside can be hollowed out and filled with a heavily armored research complex. This shall allow us conduct all manner of research in secret without destroying the countryside."
 MIT_expand_rubber_plantations:0 "Expand Rubber Plantations"
 MIT_expand_rubber_plantations_desc:0 "Rubber has long been the primary export of Asterion. This is partly due to Imperial investment in the plantations, which meant that most of the produce was confiscated in the name of the Emperor to supply their own economy. But now that we are free, the plantations belong to us and so do their profits. We should plant even more rubber trees and become the rubber capital of Griffonia."
 MIT_building_slots_continuous:0 "Repetitive Building Programs"
 MIT_building_slots_continuous_desc:0 "Government officials are apparently tired of the military always asking them for massive purchases of land to expand onto, so they've decided to authorize us to purchase land on our own. Should be fun once they get finished with the paperwork."

 MIT_political_effort:0 "Divided We Are Weak!"
 MIT_political_effort_desc:0 "The squabbling and disputes between the Unity party and the increasingly popular Fascio-Communist coalition must end! We are getting distracted from our main duty: Retaking our lost lands, liberating our race and safeguarding our freedom at any cost. If we keep arguing, unable to have a single, shared vision of the future, we will crumble and once again become slaves."

 MIT_coalition_victory:0 "Fascio-Communist Victory!"
 MIT_coalition_victory_desc:0 "Many said it couldn't be done, but the unified party of the fascists and the communists have finally secured an electoral majority. Asterion waits with bated breath for how this party made up of people who once swore that real change could only come through violent revolution will govern."
 MIT_creeper_mountains:0 "Negotiate For Creeper Mountains"
 MIT_creeper_mountains_desc:0 "During their misguided offensive to seize yet more of our beloved land the counter revolutionary forces on the mainland lost control of the Creeper Mountains. Now that the Imperialist oppressors have been disposed of it's time to secure the northernmost state. We shall open negotiations with whoever controls it now, and show the world how peace loving we are by returning the land without firing a shot. If they do not accept then we shall still show the world our resolve."
 MIT_collective_construction:0 "Collective Construction"
 MIT_collective_construction_desc:0 "To allow for the construction of the immense bulwark that will keep the collective masses of Asterion safe sacrifices will have to be made. Individuality is great in times of peace, but this is a crisis with war but a hair's breadth away. Civilians will be organized into construction crews under the military's command to accomplish this great project."
 MIT_collective_scanners:0 "Collective Scanners"
 MIT_collective_scanners_desc:0 "In order to properly defend ourselves from foreign devils we will have to invest heavily in Radio Detection And Ranging. It makes no difference how strong our defenses are if we don't know what's coming."
 MIT_antiaircraft_artillery:0 "Collective Air Defense Net"
 MIT_antiaircraft_artillery_desc:0 "But what about the possibility of an air attack? When the anti-minotaur conspirators come we will have an answer for that question."
 MIT_land_fort:0 "Fortification Collectives"
 MIT_land_fort_desc:0 "Castles, watchtowers, walls, trenches, and all other manner of fortification. We shall build them all. The filthy featherbrains shall fall before them like freshly slaughtered panthers."
 MIT_island_defenses:0 "Collective Shores"
 MIT_island_defenses_desc:0 "Our beaches are the envy of the world, Imperial spies have said as much before their ends, but they are also horribly exposed. We shall fix that with concrete and barbed wire. The days of fun in the sun are over, in the desperate times every beach will have to be a kill zone."
 MIT_early_rocketry:0 "Rocketry Research"
 MIT_early_rocketry_desc:0 "Now that we are safe behind our walls we shall have to find a way to attack our enemies. Powerful rockets seem to be the best answer. These supremely powerful weapons will annihilate our enemies such that they will never recover."
 MIT_rocket_bases:0 "Rocket Fortifications"
 MIT_rocket_bases_desc:0 "In order for our obliterating arrows to reach our foes they will first need to be launched. For this reason we shall construct bases for their launch, no matter the cost."

 MIT_address_the_resource_crisis:0 "Peak Crystal"
 MIT_address_the_resource_crisis_desc:0 "Asterion is safe from direct attacks by the foreign devils, and all who doubt this are saboteurs. However, that does not mean we are safe from them entirely. In their foolhardy attempts to destroy us those outside our borders have cut us off from the magnite crystals and petroleum our machines need to run. While we work on a more permanent solution we will have to tighten our belts."
 MIT_artificial_magic:0 "Synthetic Crystals"
 MIT_artificial_magic_desc:0 "Magic crystals can store a great amount of power in them. It is becoming increasingly clear to us that they can be used for all kinds of purposes. However, our domestic supply is lacking, so we must experiment with "growing" artificial crystals and see if they are as good as the natural ones."
 MIT_squeeze_oil_from_stones:0 "Squeeze Oil From Stones"
 MIT_squeeze_oil_from_stones_desc:0 "In the remains of what was once a beach resort a fort construction team has found something incredible. That is to say, oil. What the capitalist pigs call 'black gold' will serve our fleets well for now, but it has raised questions over other similar regions. Perhaps some exploration is in order."
 MIT_refining_tech:0 "Refined Refining"
 MIT_refining_tech_desc:0 "The creation of synthetic resources is the ultimate synthesis of the eternal conflicts of intersectional class and race within our country. It is because of this that we must invest heavily in refinery technology to avoid a crystal and oil gap."
 MIT_crystal_islands:0 "Crystal Islands"
 MIT_crystal_islands_desc:0 "Recently it was discovered that there were small deposits of magnite on the seafloor near certain southern islands. The traitors who used to run the nation would have turned away at the cost in lives that harvesting them with the current technology level would have required, but we are not so weak."
 MIT_new_techniques:0 "New Techniques"

 MIT_secret_treaties:0 "Secret Treaty Investigation"
 MIT_secret_treaties_desc:0 "While we wish to remain totally pure to our way of life, it is undeniable that valuable resources that we need are far beyond our reach. The Wingbardians have opposed The Empire in the past, so it is possible they are less filthy than the rest. More importantly, they have oil. Perhaps it is best to begin unseen negotiations."
 MIT_oil_for_gurrentees:0 "Secret Treaty Realization"
 MIT_oil_for_gurrentees_desc:0 "The Wingbardians have accepted our proposal. Now all we have to do is sign it and we shall have our oil. The clause about joining them in war is a mere formality, for we are undefeatable."
 MIT_forced_labor:0 "Forced Crystal Mining"
 MIT_forced_labor_desc:0 "Now that we have liberated the degenerate Sicameonese from themselves we can take them under a guiding hand leading them on the path to true socialism. The first issue is that they are working under the illusion that you can save lives while mining. We shall disabuse them of this notion."
 MIT_forced_oil:0 "Forced Oil Refining"
 MIT_forced_oil_desc:0 "Oil workers are skilled labor, and as such are not completely expendable. However, that also necessarily makes them suspicious in the class struggle. We shall force the Sicameonese to realize this, and so make them better. This will also improve their ability to work for us."
 MIT_colonial_forts:0 "Illuminary Line"
 MIT_colonial_forts_desc:0 "Our benevolent guiding light has brought joy and unity to the junior collectives, and all who threaten that with their violent words are dealt with appropriately. However, there is still one final lesson. For while they are ultimately expendable next to the Fatherland, fortifications still must be constructed to prevent hostile forces as far from us as possible."
 MIT_party_loyalty:0 "One Party, One Loyalty"
 MIT_party_loyalty_desc:0 "We have gone through many trials, and after so long it can firmly be said that we are no longer a divided party. The old petty conflicts of Communism versus Fascism have fallen away thanks to the Dear Leader's efforts. We are of one mind, one vision, one purpose."

 MIT_democratic_victory:0 "Unity Party Victorious!"
 MIT_democratic_victory_desc:0 "After a contentious political season and a long debate the Unity Party has emerged victorious!

 MIT_democratic_alliance:0 "Formalize the CSN"
 MIT_democratic_alliance_desc:0 "In recent years there has been a movement to formalize our alliance with our democratic amigos in Sicameon to allow for military and logistic cooperation. In a world filled with monarchs, dictators, and evil wizards, it is argued, the free peoples of the world need to band together for defense against those who would see them as slaves. The Coalition of Sovereign Nations will evolve to become that band, and together we happy few shall make the world safe for liberty."

 MIT_military_advisors:0 "Military Advisors"
 MIT_military_advisors_desc:0 "By streamlining the bureaucracy and communications set-up the strain that military attaches to foreign powers put on our command structure can be greatly reduced.

 MIT_foreign_service:0 "Asterionese Foreign Service"
 MIT_foreign_service_desc:0 "Currently non-military diplomatic duties are undertaken by a variety of different organizations formed ad-hoc for various causes over the years and simply left to continue operating.

 MIT_SIC_assistance:0 "Coalition Research Directorate"

 MIT_trade_federation_friendship:0 "Trade Federation Friendship"

If they have fallen to monarchy or anarchy, then we shall intervene."

 MIT_north_changeling_friendship_desc:0 "Grenclyf is a country that we have only recently made formal political contact with, but it has quickly captured the imagination of the Asterionese populace, seeing it as a throwback to the mythological time before Aster's fleet left the original minotaur homeland, but with a modern twist. While some are wary of inviting a nation with such a limited franchise into our alliance the fact still remains that are choice in allies are slim. They are likely to reject the other because of distance, but we can at least get a relations boost out of the efforts."
 MIT_command_council:0 "Coalition Command Council"
 MIT_command_council_desc:0 "As forces from different nations in the CSN continue to fight alongside each other the need for a unified command at the strategic level becomes more clear. By setting up a council of war we can prevent further incidents like what happened with our sailors and the Sicameonese marines back in '02. We're still playing back that family for what happened to their penguins."
 MIT_coalition_trade:0 "Coalition Free Trade Agreement"
 MIT_coalition_trade_desc:0 "If we trust each other enough to die for each other we should trust each other enough to buy each other's stuff. Doing this with minor supplies will free up that much more production capacity for construction projects."
 MIT_coalition_immigration:0 "Coalition Work Visa"
 MIT_coalition_immigration_desc:0 "As the need for military contractors to travel through different nations to do their jobs increases the paperwork involved also increases. By issuing a visa that is accepted by all CSN member states to those individuals deemed worthy of the privilege of free movement we can greatly reduce overhead costs. As a side effect, member states might see slight increases in their working populations."
 MIT_coalition_exchange_students:0 "CSN Cadet Exchange Program"
 MIT_coalition_exchange_students_desc:0 "Each of the militaries of the Coalition brings something unique and interesting to the table, not only in terms of material but also in terms of tradition and tactics. Allowing our cadets the chance to spend a semester in a foreign school will those give them different perspectives that will make them better officers."
 MIT_pirate_hunting:0 "Operation Keelhaul"
 MIT_pirate_hunting_desc:0 "The zebra and deer colonies on the continent have long resorted to piracy and other horrible crimes to get what they want. Now they are threatening our trade with Grenclyf. No more! We must mobilize the CSN to finally wipe this threat from the face of the planet."
 MIT_operation_edelweiss:0 "Operation Edelweiss"
 MIT_operation_edelweiss_desc:0 "Now that the coast has been secured the full extent of crimes in the Magocracy of Barard has been discovered. These horrors can not be allowed to continue, so we must intervene."
 MIT_parasite_purge:0 "Operation White Bear"
 MIT_parasite_purge_desc:0 "The Gryphon Host has been a plague upon the peoples of South Griffonia for centuries. It’s time to finally cure that plague, one way or the other."
 MIT_LUS_puppet:0 "Operation Green Thumb"
 MIT_LUS_puppet_desc:0 "Lushi is a land much like ours, with conflict and divisions hounding them at every turn. Unlike our lands, however, they have stuck with their old feudal system that The Empire imposed on the region. It's time to issue them an ultimatum. Do they stand with the future, or do they stand with the past?"
 MIT_river_relations:0 "Foreign Mission To the Riverlands"
 MIT_river_relations_desc:0 "The Riverlands have long been a bulwark against The Empire, so it only makes sense for us to make friends with the nations within. Time has not stood still though, and many things have changed in the river basin since the completion of Operation Odysseus. We’ll need a dedicated inquiry to decide how to proceed."

 MIT_BAN_border_war:0 "Operation Final Liberation"
 MIT_BAN_border_war_desc:0 "It’s time to take back the Creeper Mountains, one way or the other. A plan for a rapid seizure of land using no more than six divisions is being drawn up, and all will need to do once it is completed is position the correct divisions into position before sending the go ahead. This is it, after all this time our nation will be one once again."
 MIT_arrest_blackrock:0 "Operation Clean Sweep"
 MIT_arrest_blackrock_desc:0 "Now that the Creeper Mountains are back under our control we have the opportunity to end the threat of the northern bandit kingdom once and for all. We shall show the world that the long arm of Asterionese justice cannot be outrun."
 MIT_prywhen_intervention:0 "Operation Merchant Causeway"
 MIT_prywhen_intervention_desc:0 "The Free Towns have long been our friends, but recient political changes have meant that drastic action must be taken to protect our intrests in the Gryphus Sea."
 MIT_prywhen_puppet:0 "A New Prywhen"
 MIT_prywhen_puppet_desc:0 "Now that the old order has been swept away and a new government installed that is more amicable to our views we can focus on the next task, which is perhaps more important than the first. We must make right all the destruction we’ve caused. It will expensive, but it is the only acceptable thing to do."
 MIT_BOI_attack:0 "Operation Homecoming"
 MIT_BOI_attack_desc:0 "In perhaps the most controversial move of our crusade the next stage of the plan calls for an attack on the original capital of The Empire, Griffonstone. The rough and mountainous terrain will be a nightmare to fight in, but worse will be the fallout. Perhaps the diplomats will be able to prevent the need for this attack before it begins."
 MIT_BAN_BOI_integration:0 "Reintegrate the Bandit Kingdom"
 MIT_BAN_BOI_integration_desc:0 "Originally the land controlled by Blackrock and her criminal underlings was part of Griffonstone’s territory. Now that both regions are under the control of governments who are part of the CSN perhaps the two can unite once more, or not. It is up to them to decide, but we can at least remind them."
 MIT_forts_of_griffonstone:0 "Forts of Griffonstone"
 MIT_forts_of_griffonstone_desc:0 "The reach of the Coalition has extended to the point where we now border The Empire. This is a fact at once exciting and terrifying, so a proposal has been made to build a series of forts along the thin dividing line. It should, at the very least, slow them down should they attack when we’re not ready."
 MIT_rebel_cells:0 "Finance Rebel Cells"
 MIT_rebel_cells_desc:0 "We must keep The Empire distracted for as long as possible, and we must also make sure the people over whom they rule are ready to rise up to fight for their own freedom. Those are two good reasons why the formation of rebel cells inside The Empire must be encouraged as much as possible."
 MIT_align_FAL:0 "Operation Burning Lily"
 MIT_align_FAL_desc:0 "Falcor is ruled by a wicked and untrustworthy leader, who no doubt will try to kill us at to soonest opportunity. We must prevent this, and free the people of Falcor from the tyranny of their government, including the minotaurs amongst their populace. Some worry about the diplomatic fallout, but that can be calculated by the politicians."
 MIT_align_pact:0 "Align the Karthinian Pact"
 MIT_align_pact_desc:0 "The Karthinian Pact was the original alliance to break away from The Empire, which lead to our freedom. We owe them a great debt for that, but we are not blind. A monarch will always betray you, and we must take time for the people of the Pact to be made aware of that."
 MIT_final_pact:0 "Operation Gambler"
 MIT_final_pact_desc:0 "We’ve given the Pact enough time to come over to our way of thinking. At this point they are either with us, or against us. Those who support democracy we will shake the claw of, and those who support collectivism we will strike down."
 MIT_prepare_the_homefront:0 "Prepare the Homefront"
 MIT_prepare_the_homefront:0 "The day of destiny is almost upon us. That wonderful awful day when either The Empire will die, or we will. We must take measures to make sure our entire society is ready for this task. Every single male, female, and youth must be willing to do their part."

jakistan.1.t:0 "Call to Arms!"
 jakistan.1.d:0 "With the outbreak of conflict with Yakyakistan, Prince Bradford has issued a call to arms. All Jakistani yaks who are fit for service have been requested to enter military service immediately. Furthermore, all local \"militia\" groups of the Jaki Clan have been nationalized, and have been brought under the Prince's command."
 jakistan.1.a:0 "To arms, brothers!"
 jakistan.2.t:0 "Jaki Clan is ready"
 jakistan.2.d:0 "All the pieces are in place. The Jaki Clan is now ready to assimilate into Yakyakistan proper."
 jakistan.2.a:0 "Here's to a united Yakyakistan.\n§R Continuing down this path will end your game."
 jakistan.2.b:0 "Maybe this isn't a good idea after all."
 jakistan.3.t:0 "Down with Bradford"
 jakistan.3.d:0 "Recent events have made it abundantly clear that the old monarchy of Yakyakistan under Prince Bradford is no longer working. Despite the best efforts of his tutors, who tried their best to induct him into Jaki culture, he is simply too much of a westerner to lead the Jaki kingdom. He has already been placed under house arrest, and his days as a ruler are numbered. But who should take his place? The decision rests squarely on the shoulders of the Kurultai - the Elders' Council."
 jakistan.3.a:0 "They will make the right choice."
 jakistan.4.t:0 "The Kurultai's Verdict"
 jakistan.4.d:0 "It has grown clear that the council is divided. A decision that was expected to take a week has now carried on for months. The Khans have been divided amongst themselves, each espousing a different belief regarding not only Bradford's successor, but also the form of government they should adopt. The split is between those who would like to return to the old ways of plunder and conquest of the Yakistani Empire, those who wish to follow the model of Stalliongrad and adopt the values of freedom and equality, and those who espouse the ideals of friendship and harmony, like the ponies of the South. Despite the clear differences between these factions, it has grown clear from the growing crowds of protestors that a decision must be made soon. As it stands, however, the decision could swing in any direction..."
 jakistan.4.a:0 "The Harmonists have the right of it."
 jakistan.4.b:0 "The Khan shall return."
 jakistan.4.c:0 "The Jaks must come together, as equals."
 jakistan.5.t:0 "Jakistani Overtures"
 jakistan.5.d:0 "A strange thing happened today. Apparently, the yaks of the Jaki Clan have decided to visit, all in the name of friendship. It would seem they would like to form a new relationship with [ROOT.GetName]. Though the request was awkward in its wording, it seems to be genuine."
 jakistan.5.a:0 "Oh. Great!"
 jakistan.6.t:0 "Mending Fences"
 jakistan.6.d:0 "Jaki Clan and Yakyakistan have been at each other's throats for centuries. However, with the ponies' help, the Jaks have realized the error of their ways. It is time to put this conflict behind us, for the good of yaks everywhere. Thus, the Jaki Clan has drafted a letter to send to [YAK.GetName], in the interest of forming a unified kingdom under the new Jaki government. Hopefully our Yakistani bretheren have seen the light as well."
 jakistan.6.a:0 "Send it."
 jakistan.7.t:0 "An Interesting Request"
 jakistan.7.d:0 "A letter arrived in Yakistown today, addressed to [ROOT.GetLeader]. The yaks of Jaki Clan have decided that they would like us to peacefully unite with them, under a single government. Specifically theirs. How should [ROOT.GetLeader] respond?"
 jakistan.7.a:0 "Anything for a united people."
 jakistan.7.b:0 "No. This is a ridiculous offer."
 jakistan.7.c:0 "What!? No! This is an insult! Yaks declare war!"
 jakistan.8.t:0 "Yaks said yes"
 jakistan.8.d:0 "The yaks of [YAK.GetName] have agreed to unite peacefully under the Jakistani banner. This is a great day for all yaks, and a great day for friendship!"
 jakistan.8.a:0 "Hooray."
 jakistan.9.t:0 "Yaks said no"
 jakistan.9.d:0 "The yaks of [YAK.GetName] rejected our generous offer at peaceful reunification. It would seem the interests of their government outweigh the interests of their own people."
 jakistan.9.a:0 "That's terrible..."
 jakistan.9.b:0 "We should do something about this. Let us liberate Yakyakistan! For harmony!"
 jakistan.10.t:0 "Yaks declared war"
 jakistan.10.d:0 "The yaks of Yakyakistan not only rejected our offer, but apparently took it as an insult. In response, they've declared war!"
 jakistan.10.a:0 "This is a disaster!"
 jakistan.11.t:0 "New Generals"
 jakistan.11.d:0 "With the recent expansion of the Jaki military, it has become clear that [ROOT.GetName] is sorely lacking in leadership. Thus, the government has put programs in place to uplift new, fresh leaders to take command of the Jakistani armed forces. The programs have yielded a number of promising candidates, but only two stick out as exceptional individuals, worthy of the highest levels of command."
 jakistan.11.a:0 "Ok."
 jakistan.12.t:0 "Jakistani Demands"
 jakistan.12.d:0 "A set of demands arrived today from [JAK.GetName]. They want full administrative control over two territories in the former Griffon Frontier: Amdral Nuur and Uulin Griffins. They seem to think these states are theirs by right, including the town of Makomo and the crystal mines in the Uulin mountains. The claim is backed by a century-old treaty with Yakyakistan, apparently establishing an official boundary with Nova Griffonia. How should we respond?"
 jakistan.12.a:0 "Very well, they can take it."
 jakistan.12.b:0 "That land is ours. They can't have it."

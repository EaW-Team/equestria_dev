windego.2.a:0 "So long."

windego.3.t:0 "After The Storm"
windego.3.d:0 "The last winter was colder than usual. Icy winds blew from the north and blizzards were common. At first we thought it was natural, but during that winter the border patrols of the Arcturian Order, which were once zealously guarding the border, were gone. They never returned.\n\nNow word has reached us from brave individuals who dared to venture into the frozen lands of the Order. They say that the land has been completely deserted. The towns and villages are empty husks and frozen corpses littered the ground.\n\nIt is impossible to say for sure what happened, but the Order has apparently ceased to exist. Now no one controls the lands they once held. This presents an opportunity for us to move in and take it for ourselves. While the area is depopulated, we can take advantage of local natural resources. The question is, do we dare to claim such cursed lands?"
windego.3.a:0 "Don't see why not."
windego.3.b:0 "Let it be someone else's problem."

EWI_DESC_OLDSPEC:0 "This isn't a Windigo. What is it? Where did it come from? What is it doing here? Is it even alive?"
EWI_DESC_WINDIGO:0 "Windigos are among the most horrible creatures of the world. They have neither pity nor mercy in their souls, and they take delight in turning friend against friend and breaking the bonds of fellowship. They were long believed a myth, but it is clear now they are all too real."

 nuke_first.1.d_pony_democratic:0 ""Twenty hours ago, the [Root.GetAdjective] Armed Forces detonated a new and powerful weapon in an isolated testing range. The bomb in question had the power of more than 10,000 regular bombs. In its present form, the weapon is an atomic bomb, uniting magic and science to unleash a power heretofore unknown.\nBut it is not the explosion itself that should be remembered but the fact that it was only possible by thousands of minds coming together to make this marvel of science. Everypony, scholar and scientist worked as one to create this weapon in such a short time. Let us hope that we may never end up having to use this for its purpose, but that it may help us ensure peace."\n - [Root.GetLeader]'s speech, [?global.date.GetDateStringNoHourLong]"
 nuke_first.1.a_pony_democratic:0 "These are the stakes: To make a world in which all of us can live, or to go into the darkness."

 nuke_first.1.d_pony_communism:0 "Today, the usual fare in the official newspapers was broken up and an unusual frontpage appeared. A photograph of a giant mushroom explosion taken in a nondescript region of [Root.GetName]. [Root.GetLeader] was quick to give a statement from the balcony of the Palace of Science in [Root.capital.GetName]. The speech emphasised that the weapon, codenamed "Unity" is "to be used in a  war with the reactionaries". Indeed, there are rumours that another bomb has already been made and is ready for deployment. [Root.GetLeader] finished off their statement by saying that "The unity of the proletariat has come together to build this weapon more powerful than anycreature could have dreamt of!""
 nuke_first.1.a_pony_communism:0 "Another weapon for the Revolution."

 nuke_first.1.d_pony_fascism:0 "[Root.GetLeader] stood before the crowd in the plaza below, who were hastily rounded up loyalists and ponies encouraged by the guards to come. Planes flew overhead, each bearing the national insignia. Bomber aircraft, of course, and strategic bombers at that.\n"Today, we have proven that there is nothing our nation, [Root.GetName], cannot do. Our new weapon, which sees magic and science coming together to create something bigger, holds the key to the power of the Wendigos. Our might has been magnified a thousand times by this weapon, and our enemies will tremble in fear! Part of the power of the sun itself, to be harnessed at a moment’s notice. They now know, that no matter what they do, our words are backed by nuclear weapons.""
 nuke_first.1.a_pony_fascism:0 "There shall be death...and then peace."

 nuke_first.1.d_pony_neutrality:0 "All around the country, either by radio, or by pegasus, news has gone out that a devastating new weapon has been tested by our nation. The weapon, presumably a crystal-uranium blend has been shown to be able to destroy entire cities, maybe even kill all of its population. [Root.GetLeader] made a speech in reaction to the news, where the existence of the weapon, called "Wendigo" by its creators to reflect its power, was confirmed. Wendigo, according to military sources ,"levelled buildings in a large radius". Whether a deterrent against war or a catalyst for it, the weapon’s effect on our nation will be felt."
 nuke_first.1.a_pony_neutrality:0 "What we create, what we will take with us."

 nuke_first.1.d_griffon_democratic:0 "As the last adjustments were made, the last bits of the equations counted and the final prototype finished, we prepared the weapon for its ghastly purpose. Laying it down into an uninhabited area we sat down in the bunker's viewing area to see if it functioned. First the alarms rang, drowning our ears in noise and its lights colouring the bunker red. Then the countdown began to echo in our ears... '10... 9....' And all I could wonder is if it was worth it. '6... 5...' The late nights working, sacrificing time with our families to finish this project, '2... 1...' and so the earth shook under us and we felt the shockwave from there as it exploded. Blinding us with its light and destroying the whole area in a purple haze of destruction and hellfire. Nothing remained, the bunker's outer layer turned to dust and the area pulsed with purple corruption as the radiation and magic mixed."
 nuke_first.1.a_griffon_democratic:0 "I believe that Eyr weeps at what we have created, while Maar cackles at our foolishness."

 nuke_first.1.d_griffon_communism:0 "The dust settled on the test site somewhere in [Root.GetName], as the purple mushroom cloud cleared out. Griffons in heavy rubber suits and gas masks swarmed around the brilliant glow remaining in the air. Small lightning bolts shot around the site, sometimes nearly hitting a griffon. When they came closer, they saw the ruins of the example buildings. One of the griffons took out a radio and said one thing into it:\n\n"Usurper has succeeded."\n\nIn a conference room somewhere in [Root.capital.GetName], three jubilant cheers rang out."
 nuke_first.1.a_griffon_communism:0 "Maar has been usurped. The Workers now rule."

 nuke_first.1.d_griffon_fascism:0 "The last few screws were tightened, the last few cores inserted into the device. The general walked over to the small viewport in the bunker, studying the device as it dangled, held up by a steel wire and cables running into small openings in the nuclear bomb. Everygriff strapped on goggles, before a brilliant purple flash drowned out all other light. Magic and Science in unison. In unison for power and destruction. Was it worth it? The way that we have demonstrated what power can be harnessed by making something that was peaceful into a weapon so powerful it could vaporize cities?\n\nYes."
 nuke_first.1.a_griffon_fascism:0 "We have become Maar, the destroyer of Worlds."

 nuke_first.1.d_griffon_neutrality:0 "The last few dials were being adjusted in the test bunker as the device codenamed "BOREAS" hung from the tower. Scientists were milling about, reading the newest results from the various instruments connected to the device. Alarms sounded. Griffons ran for the bunkers and those inside strapped on goggles.\nThen - an explosion, unlike anything ever seen before was unleashed from the ground, blinding some of the unfortunate griffons that hadn’t gotten their goggles on in time. It threw tanks and trees around and when everything was over, nothing of the test site remained. Only the bunkers that the scientists had taken refuge in stood, although covered in purple dust and heavily scarred from the experience. One of the scientists, a religious type, stood up and looked at the mushroom cloud:"
 nuke_first.1.a_griffon_neutrality:0 "Boreas help us all..."

 nuke_first.1.d_changeling_democratic:0 "The hastily constructed spires holding up the bomb buckled and crackled under the weight of the weapon. Changeling drones buzzed around the weapon as the last few wires were plugged into the contacts and solder dripped down as a silver rain on the ground below. Switches flipped as the workers left the bomb on its own...and an air siren sounded...Thirty seconds until detonation. Every changeling began to fly for cover, and into the heavily fortified bunkers...Twenty seconds...the blast doors closed...ten seconds...goggles on, or eyes away...detonation.\nThe detonation threw around old tanks and concrete structures like building blocks. The tower that had held the bomb melted away. And as the mushroom cloud bellowed into the sky, there was a silent murmur going through the crowd of scientists:"
 nuke_first.1.a_changeling_democratic:0 "We have created death. May our children forgive us."

 nuke_first.1.d_changeling_communism:0 "The red banners fluttered in the wind as the national anthem played over the loudspeakers. On the plaza, or what passed for a plaza, hordes of drones had gathered in anticipation of the announcement. Plus, it made for a good break from the usual work, even if it was getting late.\nThe lights went out. The projectors on the tower behind them lit up, playing a prepared reel. It showed a kind of explosion, even if it was in monochrome. No, what made it different was the lightning that came out of the mushroom cloud. It looked like the reactions from magical accidents, and yet, it was more devastating. More destructive. More powerful.\nOne of the drones began to cheer. Soon, a shout went through the workers:"
 nuke_first.1.a_changeling_communism:0 "All power to the free hives!"

 nuke_first.1.d_changeling_fascism:0 "[Root.GetLeader] entered the bunker, full dress uniform and the whole one yard. Through the thick glass and miasma, the weapon, the ultimate weapon, dangled in the distance. The weapon that could end the war, vaporise cities. And yet, it looked harmless. Just an egg-like metallic structure, and nothing else.\n[Root.GetLeader] walked up to a red switch with a skull decal over it, and flicked it. Red lights began to glow in the bunker, and outside, flares of all colours shot up. The various drones scurried away quickly, as instruments sputtered to life, monitors and meters, every one of them. Only a few drones remained as the weapon detonated and whirled up a magic storm. Purple lightning struck around the sites as the unlucky few drones were vaporized or thrown around like ragdolls. And yet, the scientists spotted [Root.GetLeader] with a smile on their face."

 nuke_first.1.d_changeling_neutrality:0 "The Quantum-Ring Theorem. What some might consider bunkum. But we know that it can be united with science. Magic is science. And the science of war is a noble science. And now it can be taken to its ultimate conclusion. We have created a way to extract the power of magic from controlled spells and make it unchained, unleashed, unstoppable. But while everycreature outside of our borders might think we will go on the attack with it, I say that this is untrue. But if we find ourselves the victim of an attack, we will not hesitate to use any means at our disposal."
 nuke_first.1.a_changeling_neutrality:0 "Will it work? The Deterrent?"
 
 nuke_first.1.d_generic_democratic:0 ""So, in conclusion, we can say that all creatures, no matter their origin or appearance, should deserve that they be treated as any other. But there are those that seek to destroy us. In fact, the fascists and equalists seek to destroy what we have built and are building on. They have taken up arms or want to take up arms against us. We must therefore always be on guard for Harmony. We must therefore be vigilant against threats. We must therefore, reluctantly, create a weapon so powerful that they will not seek to destroy us."\n - the writings of an unknown [Root.GetAdjective] scientist, [GetYear]"

 nuke_first.1.d_generic_communism:0 ""We stand today as the masters of our own fate. We will no longer be influenced by other nations. But we will not walk alone. We all stand together for our own fate. The workers and the peasants shall never be under the yoke of the reactionaries again, as we stand united now, as a proletariat. They can no longer subdue us with their weapons, as we now have a weapon that is the power of the sun itself usurped and in a deployable form.\n\nSo while the reactionaries might threaten to come and chain us again, we say, if you come, you will bleed on the sun and on the will of the People!"\n - [Root.GetLeader]'s speech, [?global.date.GetDateStringNoHourLong]"

The mushroom cloud formed in the distance, and the crowd turned to witness the sight.\n\n"Today, we have shown the world that we possess the power of the sun itself, deployable wherever we want. The device detonated is proof that we can harness that power. Those who seek to destroy the state, whatever they might try ,will have to go against the power of the sun itself, and the will of the [Root.GetRaceMembers] of [Root.GetName]. We shall go on to be victorious, we shall go on to stand above all. We shall be the chosen to stand above all else. Nobody will be able to withstand our might when we unleash our newfound power.""

From various sources, the [Root.capital.GetName] Inquirer has learned that the weapon is both magical and mechanical in nature, with a power on a scale which had previously only been theoretical.\n[Root.GetLeader] in their radio address said that this may be first step in a new kind of power that could be harnessed for peaceful purposes in the future, while the Army has reported through press releases that the new weapon shrouded the test site in "A thick cloud of destabilized magic and radiation.""

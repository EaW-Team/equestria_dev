 wingbardy.1.t:0 "The Death of General Giuseppe Gellera"
 wingbardy.1.d:0 "General Giuseppe Gellera has been killed in action.\n\nWhile defending an important road, Gellera's troops found themselves cut off by the enemy and facing encirclement. Gellera personally took command of one of the few functioning tanks and lead the breakout effort. However, during the action, he was hit by an anti-tank shell and took shrapnel to the lungs. He died few hours later in an enemy hospital.\n\nFor his gallantry in action Gellera has been posthumously awarded with the Gold Medal of Military Valour. Wingbardy's highest military decoration."
 wingbardy.1.a:0 "A living general is better then a dead hero."

 wingbardy.2.t:0 "Wingbardy Claims the Griffonstone Crown"
 wingbardy.2.d:0 "Mounting political pressure has come to a head today with the Wingbardian Government granting the king of Wingbardy the crown of Griffonstone. Such an act has shoked Griffons throught the nation. Officals appointed by the Wingbardian government are alredy making moves to intergrate what little freedoms we had with Wingbardy, forming an end of our two nations."
 wingbardy.2.a:0 "We welcome our king."
 wingbardy.2.b:0 "We shall stand for our freedom!"
 
 wingbardy.3.t:0 "Griffonstone Folds"
 wingbardy.3.d:0 "The Griffonstone government has been fully integrated into our own with little opposition."
 wingbardy.3.a:0 "Long live the king."
 
 wingbardy.4.t:0 "Griffonstone Rebels!"
 wingbardy.4.d:0 "Forces still loyal to the Griffonstone government have rounded up our officials in protest of our planned merging of our nations. For all intents and purpouses, Griffonstone is now free from our control."
 wingbardy.4.a:0 "They shall pay for this treachery."

 wingbardy.5.t:0 "King Garibald Talonuel III has Died"
 wingbardy.5.d:0 "King Garibald Talonuel III passed away this morning after a period of illness. Ever since the murder of his father in 971, Garibald Talonuel has led Wingbardy through times of both triumph and hardship. He was instrumental in the collapse of the Griffonian Empire, protected the south from Imperial aggression and united the nation through the long and bloody war with Falcor. Garibald Talonuel was also a prolific coin collector with over 100,000 coins in his private collection, each of them personally documented and studied. He left his collection to the National Karthinian Museum for all Wingbardians to enjoy.\n\nThe throne now passes to his son Prince Gumberto, who is a mere shadow of his father. His life has been one of scandal and criticism with many prominent Wingbardians having openly spoken out against him. Only time will tell what kind of King he will make."
 wingbardy.5.a:0 "All Wingbardians mourn today."

 wingbardy.6.t:0 "The National Anthem Debate"
 wingbardy.6.d:0 "In recent days, a debate has been growing out of the Blackshirt's control over the national anthem of Wingbardy. La Marcia Reale d'Ordinanza has been the national anthem for close to 100 years, but ever since Beakolini and his Fascist took power their own anthem, Giovinezza, has (often forcefully) supplanted it. Those loyal to the King see this as a great betrayal of Wingbardian tradition, but the King has remained silent on the issue. There is now a debate in parliament on whether la Marcia Reale d'Ordinanza should be officially replaced by Giovinezza as the official national anthem of the nation.\n\nIt is expected to go the Blackshirt's way, after all, la Marcia Reale d'Ordinanza has no official lyrics while Giovinezza has such wonderful verses as \"With a Wingbardian's pride swear fealty to Beakolini\". This mandatory anthem is merely the griffons showing how much they love Il Duce. \n\nUnlike his father, Prince Gumberto has not remained silent on the issue. He has instead proposed La Leggenda del Piumave as a compromise. The popular song dates to the Falcor War and tales of the flooding of the river Piumave, halting Falcor's invasion of Wingbardy shortly after the disastrous battle at Clawporetto and how it allowed the Regio Esercito time to launch the counter attack required to push Falcor back and to final victory at the battle of Garibald Gergamo.\n\nWith the debate being held, who will carry the day?"
 wingbardy.6.a:0 "La Marcia Reale d'Ordinanza is the true anthem of Wingbardy!"
 wingbardy.6.b:0 "Giovinezza! For Youth! For Beakolini!"
 wingbardy.6.c:0 "La Leggenda del Piumave will be a great compromise."
 
 wingbardy.7.t:0 "Wingbardy Sues For Peace"
 wingbardy.7.d:0 "A communique from [From.GetLeader] has been received, asking for peace. New Mareland has capitulated, Sunset has fallen and [EQC.GetLeader]'s government has been forced into exile. It would be difficult for us to liberate our colony from the griffon claws, for the sea between us is wide and the Wingbardian navy is a threat that may be too great to overcome. However, would this be a betrayal of our loyal subjects down under? Should we keep waging a futile war, hoping that one day the New Marelander flag flies once more atop Sunset?"
 wingbardy.7.a:0 "They have won."
 wingbardy.7.b:0 "We won't abandon our friends!"
 
 wingbardy.8.t:0 "[From.GetName] Refuses"
 wingbardy.8.d:0 "[From.GetLeader] has foolishly refused our benign and reasonable call for peace between our nations. They want to keep fighting, vainly hoping to greedily seize New Mareland from our claws. Very well, let them come! The royal navy is ready to face them."
 wingbardy.8.a:0 "New Mareland is ours!"
 
 wingbardy.50.t:0 "Communists Seize Power! Civil War Has Begun!"
 wingbardy.50.d:0 "The riots throughout our cities has broken out into a full blown civil war. Communist forces have taken the capital and other cities along the coast, driving the Fascists and Royalists inland. With the King's blessing, Beakolini has taken command of the Royalist Government and swears to end our revolution."
 wingbardy.50.a:0 "Viva la rivoluzione!"

 wingbardy.51.t:0 "The Civil War is Over!"
 wingbardy.51.d:0 "Beakolini is dead and the former King has fled the nation. The few remaining fascists have either surrendered, fled or have taken their own lives as our forces liberate the last remaining strongholds.\n\nThe war is finally over and the griffons are celebrating in the streets! The future of Wingbardy looks bright for all griffons."
 wingbardy.51.a:0 "Now to rebuild."

 wingbardy.101.t:0 "The Southern Military Strategy"
 wingbardy.101.d:0 "Wingbardian military planners have proposed a united strategy for the defence of our nations and the South. By creating a Joint Defence Command, we can improve our battle plans in the event of any military action."
 wingbardy.101.a:0 "A great idea!"
 
 wingbardy.102.t:0 "Wingbardy Demands New Mareland"
 wingbardy.102.d:0 "The ambassador from Wingbardy presented an ultimatum this morning. Citing the illegitimate occupation of griffon land, subjugation of griffons, and illegal pony settlements, Wingbardy is demanding that we renounce all claim to the colonies of New Mareland and allow native griffons a rightful place in the colonial management.\n\nObviously, this is sure to result in the Wingbardian occupation of the New Mareland ponies, all of whom will undoubtedly be threatened by the new regime."
 wingbardy.102.a:0 "In the name of Peace, we must accept."
 wingbardy.102.b:0 "We shall not let our ponies suffer under griffon talons."
 
 wingbardy.1021.t:0 "[From.GetName] has Betrayed Us!"
 wingbardy.1021.d:0 "Under pressure from the Wingbardian government, Equestria has agreed to hand over control of our government to Wingbardy. [Root.GetLeader] has received direct orders to stand down and hand over power to Wingbardy's chosen replacement. This act of betrayal has shocked the nation. Thousands have taken to the streets in protests and popularity with pro-independence factions as skyrocketed.\n\nWith Wingbardy already forcing their troops over the border, our independence hangs in the balance."
 wingbardy.1021.a:0 "We cannot resist this..."
 wingbardy.1021.b:0 "They'll have to take our freedom from our cold, dead hooves!"
 
 wingbardy.1022.t:0 "Wingbardy has Demanded Our Annexation!"
 wingbardy.1022.d:0 "The Wingbardian ambassador to Equestria handed over a list of outrageous demands that would result in the total annexation of Wingbardy under the guise of 'freeing' the native population of our nation. As expected, the Princess has thrown those bird-brains out on their arses.\n\nBut they didn't appear to get the message as their troops are lining our border looking for a fight."
 wingbardy.1022.a:0 "We must prepare for war."
 
 wingbardy.103.t:0 "Intervene in New Mareland's Civil War"
 wingbardy.103.a:0 "#TODO Annex Civil War New Mareland States"
 wingbardy.103.b:0 "We shall put an end to their internal strife."
 
 wingbardy.104.t:0 "Wingbardy Demands our Annexation!"
 wingbardy.104.d:0 "The ambassador from Wingbardy presented an ultimatum this morning. Citing the illegitimate occupation of griffon land, subjugation of griffons, and illegal pony settlements, Wingbardy is demanding that we allow Wingbardian representatives in as advisors in key government positions and for us to enact emergency pro-griffon laws.\n\nObviously, this is sure to result in the Wingbardian occupation of our nation and a great threat to our citizens."
 wingbardy.104.a:0 "There's nothing we can do."
 wingbardy.104.b:0 "We'll show those bird-brains what for!"
 
 wingbardy.105.t:0 "[From.GetName] Gives In"
 wingbardy.105.d:0 "[From.GetLeader] has agreed with our just demands and they have surrendered the colony to us. The local griffons rejoice and welcome us as liberators, while the ponies cower in their homes. We will prove them that we are more benevolent overlords and treat them better than they treated the griffon minority."
 wingbardy.105.a:0 "As expected."
 
 wingbardy.1051.t:0 "[From.GetName] Gives In"
 wingbardy.1051.d:0 "[From.GetLeader] has agreed with our just demands and the colony has surrendered to us.

 wingbardy.106.a:0 "This cannot stand!"
 
 wingbardy.1061.t:0 "[From.GetName] Refuses Our Demands"
 wingbardy.1061.d:0 "Not only did they reject our demands, they kicked our ambassador out of the nation with a giant boot."
 wingbardy.1061.a:0 "So, it's war then."
 
 wingbardy.107.t:0 "An \"Offer\" from Wingbardy"
 wingbardy.107.d:0 "After weeks of negotiations Wingbardy has presented us with an ultimatum. Either we stand down our armies, allow Wingbardian officials to oversee all aspects of our government and accept the Wingbardian rules of law, or a state of war will exist between us and [WNG.GetName]."
 wingbardy.107.a:0 "Perhaps things won't be so bad if we accept..."
 wingbardy.107.b:0 "We won't go down without a fight!"

 wingbardy.108.t:0 "Falcor Refuses!"
 wingbardy.108.d:0 "Our demands were refused by the Falcorian government, and our ambassador has been expelled from the country."
 wingbardy.108.a:0 "We won the last war. Now we finish the job."

 wingbardy.109.d:0 "Our diplomatic corps in Falcor has succeeded in its task, and while there were much grumbling from the Falcorians, our ambassador returned with an agreement for Falcor to accept Wingbardian annexation."

 wingbardy.110.d:0 "Diplomats from Wingbardy arrived today with an unexpected offer. They wish to make amends for the past and for us to join their Southern Alliance."

 wingbardy.112.t:0 "Falcor Demands the Return of their Capital"
 wingbardy.112.d:0 "In exchange for accepting an alliance with us, Falcor demands that their capital is returned to them. The city of Falcor was seized from them in the war 20 years ago and has been an important part of the Kingdom ever since. What instructions should we send to our embassy in Matton?"
 wingbardy.112.a:0 "We accept their terms."
 wingbardy.112.b:0 "Never! Good Wingbardians died for that city!"
 wingbardy.112.c:0 "They'll pay for this insolence!"

 wingbardy.120.t:0 "A Wingbardian Alliance Offer"
 wingbardy.120.d:0 "A Wingbardian delegation has arrived at our capital, coming with an invitation for our nation to join their alliance, [From.GetFactionName]. They say that we can only oppose vile communists and northern imperialists together, and that alone we are doomed.\n\nWingbardy would indeed be a powerful ally, but we must question if we wish to allow them to expand their influence. Besides, can [From.GetLeader] truly be trusted?"

 wingbardy.143.d:0 "In a spurising move, [From.GetName] has expelled the advisors we sent."
 wingbardy.143.a:0 "We shall crush them."
 wingbardy.143.b:0 "Perhaps  we should let them go, for now."
 
 wingbardy.144.t:0 "The Gattei Way"
 wingbardy.144.d:0 "The foundation of the AGWP has not been an easy affair. Due to the poor economic situation of the kingdom, the project was originally underfunded. The original chairgriffon put in charge of the operation quickly departed for fear he was set up for failure or worse. In his stead emerged Genrico Gattei. Gattei was known as a rather crafty industrialist in Taloncana. Some of his ventures were impacted but instead of abandoning them like some others when the AGWP was created, he embraced it and began to lobby the government over participation in it. After all within the government began to see the position as doomed to fail, it was awarded to Gattei.\n\nUnder Gattei's leadership, the company was reorganised more efficiently along less bureaucratic lines. However, the budget of the AGWP was still an issue. Gattei's answer to it was the Taloncana scheme. With much fanfare and press coverage, he announced that incredibly rich methane and oil deposits were found in Taloncana and that soon, Wingbardy would become oil-independent. This quickly rose confidence in the company and many rich Wingbardians and capitalists began to buy into it, providing the company with some much-needed cash.\n\nThe reality was a bit less fantastic. Oil deposits were indeed found but they were very poor compared to the methane reserves. What he did was using natural gas instead to boost the development of national industry in the region. The gas would be a cheaper and more functional substitute for the all-important coal imported at great expenses. As many of these industry belonged to Gattei's family or friends, he benefited highly from the move. This could have been one of the greatest scandal in Wingbardian history but the move ultimately lead to a boom in the region and the high profits were plowed back into the various branches of the AGWP, allowing to grow even more and strike actual oil deposits.\n\nFar from getting fired over the scheme, Gattei became a media darling and a powerful political actor. Some are calling him corrupt and the move a threat to our government's integrity. Gattei prefers to call himself 'innovative'."
 wingbardy.144.a:0 "Wingbardy does need some innovation..."

Many of these self-styled 'Blackwings' are former soldiers and veterans, providing the PNF with a substantial paramilitary force.\n\nMany moderates and socialists in the government were shocked to learn that King Garibald has no intention to stop a planned march on Karthin by the fascists.

 news_wingbardy.14.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Today representatives of southern Griffonian nations met in Talononte to sign the Treaty establishing the Southern Economic Community.\n\nThe idea, conceived by Wingbardian civil servant Gaetano Martino, quickly gained momentum among Wingbardy and its allies. The treaty is designed to help reconstruct the economies of the southern Griffonian nations, prevent war between said nations and to ensure a lasting peace in the South. This will be done through mutual cooperation and the formation of a common market. Many see it as the first step on the road to a United States of Southern Griffonia."

Ever since the alleged murder of his father, Garibald Talonuel has been a dominant force in Southern Griffonia. His actions against the empire kickstarted its collapse, he led his nation through harsh times of poverty and famine, and he united all Wingbardians in a long and bloody war with Falcor.\n\nHe is succeeded by his son Gumberto II. A scandalous griffon who openly supports Beakolini and his fascists."

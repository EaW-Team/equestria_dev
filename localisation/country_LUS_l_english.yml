POLITICS_PRINCE_ELIAS:0 "Prince Elias Whitecrest took power in the Principality of Lushi in January of 1006. He is still young and ambitious, with grand plans for his nation. The Prince knows that Lushi has the potential to modernise in the shortest terms and catch up to the rest of Griffonia. He has elected to pursue peaceful foreign policy and to focus primarily on improving the quality of life of the citizens. Many believe that Prince Elias is the leader Lushi needed long ago."
POLITICS_PRINCE_GERAR:0 "Prince Gerar Whitecrest, younger brother of Elias, sees Lushi as a strong nation that could occupy the whole basin of the Evi river. Inspired by the writings of notorious Wingbardian fascist Beakolini, he aims to create a corporate nationalist state, rooted in religion and military. He dreams of getting rid of the monarchy and proclaiming himself the Leader of the nation."

LUS_fascist_coup:0 "Prince Gerar's Coup"
LUS_fascist_coup_desc:0 "The younger brother of Prince Elias, Gerar, wishes to take the throne of the Principality of Lushi for himself. His support amongst the aristocracy is relatively small. However, that may change, if the current prince departs from the world of the living."

LUS_plot_against_elias:0 "Plot against Prince Elias"
LUS_plot_against_elias_desc:0 "Prince Elias stands in the way of Lushian greatness. His peaceful attitudes are unbefitting of a true griffon. However, the Prince enjoys a good amount of support. By consolidating our own support, we might be able to remove him entirely."

LUS_kill_elias:0 "Kill Prince Elias"
LUS_kill_elias_desc:0 "It is obvious that we cannot kill Prince Elias while he is at his castle in Lumium. We ought to wait until he goes on a trip to visit one of the lords or leaves the Castle for another reason.\n\nIf we wait too long and Elias unites the nation around himself and his ideas, killing him and taking the country into our claws will be problematic."

LUS_fight_fascists_sympathisers:0 "Fight Beakolini Sympathizers"

 #Prince Elias's Agriculture Route
LUS_agriculture_improvements:0 "Care for the Peasants"
LUS_agriculture_improvements_desc:0 "Most of our griffons work in agriculture. Most of them live under the reign of feudal lords, often in bad conditions. If we are to pull our country out of the technological and economic slump it is in, we need to start caring for the peasants."

LUS_buy_tools:0 "New Farming Techniques"
LUS_buy_tools_desc:0 "Griffons aren’t made for farming fields. To do it effectively, we need tools. By investing in teaching our peasants proper farming techniques and procuring them modern tools, we can ensure a better life for all of them. It will take time and we will have to dig deep into the Prince’s purse to fund the reform."

LUS_free_the_peasants:0 "Free the Peasants"
LUS_free_the_peasants_desc:0 "We must free the peasants from their ancient servitude to the noble lords. They are worth no less than the rest of us. A modern state relies on citizens with rights and education. Serfdom will have to go if we are to modernise our country. Hopefully this will put an end to the peasant’s protests that destabilise the country."

LUS_enslave_the_peasants:0 "Enforce Serfdom"
LUS_enslave_the_peasants_desc:0 "These meddlesome peasants seem too dumb to even understand the basic premise of our culture. The nobility care for and protect the peasants, who in turn feed the country. Very well, if the serfs do not want to listen, they will have to learn by force that the serfs belong on their turf."

LUS_organize_markets:0 "Organize Markets"
LUS_organize_markets_desc:0 "The first step to getting ourselves out of this economic slump is organising the markets. Over the centuries, many lords have given licences to markets based on many different ideas. We must inventory all the market licenses and simplify all the rules, so that our crops actually reach the hungry beaks."

LUS_grain_import:0 "Grain Imports"
LUS_grain_import_desc:0 "Sadly, our peasants cannot produce enough food right now to feed us all. Luckily some of our neighbours still have enough food. Let us intervene and buy grain for the griffons, so that no commoner goes to bed on an empty stomach."

LUS_find_jobs:0 "Employ the Commoners"
LUS_find_jobs_desc:0 "While our peasants are free now, they cannot enjoy this freedom with the current unemployment rates. However, with labour so cheap, we could plan some public works projects to employ the commoners and improve the countryside. We shall have the clerks prepare several plans, after which we can pick the ones that we deem most useful."

LUS_keep_them_busy:0 "Support our Knights"
LUS_keep_them_busy_desc:0 "We should encourage the peasants to find jobs in the military industry to support our noble military. By making sure that the people know who protect their newfound freedom, we can increase support for our chivalrous army."

LUS_keep_them_civil:0 "Keep them Civil"
LUS_keep_them_civil_desc:0 "The peasants should become artisans and work in our new factories. That way they will have a way to move up on the social ladder and increase the size of our economy at the same time. Agriculture alone is just not going to cut it, a modern country needs industry."

LUS_rice:0 "Farming Rice"
LUS_rice_desc:0 "Rice is very labour intensive to farm and will require many smart solutions to get going. However, the benefits of such a reliable food source are not to be underestimated. With this, Lushi will be able to support a larger population, without any griffon having to worry about hunger."

LUS_potatoes:0 "Farming Potatoes"
LUS_potatoes_desc:0 "Potatoes are very tasty and somewhat easier to farm than rice. Let us give our peasants a break and make potatoes our staple food source. To convince the peasants to actually eat the ugly things, perhaps Elias should go out to the countryside and eat a potato himself."

LUS_minimal_welfare:0 "Minimal Welfare"
LUS_minimal_welfare_desc:0 "To ensure the wellbeing of those who we could not employ yet, we should implement a minimal of welfare. So we shall make sure there is enough food for the unemployed and that they get at least some welfare benefits. We simply cannot afford to be too generous right now, but this gesture should show the commoners that we do in fact care about them."


 #Prince Gerar's Agriculture Route
LUS_strengthen_aristocracy_positions:0 "Strengthen Aristocratic Positions"
LUS_strengthen_aristocracy_positions_desc:0 "Only a strong elite can lead a country effectively. Luckily, Lushi already has a ruling class, the aristocracy itself. We must undo Elias’s reforms and expand the rights of the nobility. They will, in turn, reward us with their loyal support."

LUS_aristocratic_state_corporations:0 "Aristocratic State Corporations"
LUS_aristocratic_state_corporations_desc:0 "We have negotiated a deal with the nobility. They will put the revenues of their estates at our disposal for a limited time. These temporary State Corporations will help us to make enough revenue to expand our industry in other ways. It is heartwarming to see that the aristocracy cares so much for the wellbeing of Lushi."

LUS_capitalist_relations:0 "A Capitalist Nation"
LUS_capitalist_relations_desc:0 "We should not only tie the old wealth to us, but also the new money. With bribes, favourable labour contracts and other bonuses, we will entice the captains of industry to cooperate with the government. With the right griffons in the right places, we can ensure the loyalty of the market."

LUS_increase_the_army_numbers:0 "Increase the Army Numbers"
LUS_increase_the_army_numbers_desc:0 "Although our army has always relied on levies who were called into service when the need arrived. However, a strong state requires a standing army. Therefore, we must press the peasants into service. They might not be the best soldiers, but we will whip any reluctance out of them."

LUS_cadet_school_lumium:0 "Lumium Cadet School"
LUS_cadet_school_lumium_desc:0 "A new Cadet School should be founded to instruct our forces in the nuances of modern warfare. We do not only need normal infantry, but also special forces. The best and the brightest of our soldiers will be trained in this school, to show the superiority of Lushi’s army!"

LUS_land_reform:0 "Land Reform"
LUS_land_reform_desc:0 "We need to reform the Aristocratic estates. They are outdated and keep smart griffons tied to their land. Besides, we can use the pretext of Reform to reward those who have been loyal to us. By taking land from other nobles and giving it to loyalists, we will increase our power and the amount of land we can use for other purposes."

LUS_war_tax:0 "War Tax"
LUS_war_tax_desc:0 "War, the ultimate struggle to determine a nation’s place in the world, is the goal of all griffons. Our nation should be geared for warfare and support the glorious military as best as it can. All the commoners must make sacrifices to ensure the victory of Lushi and Prince Gerar!"

LUS_promote_religion:0 "Religion in All Spheres of Life"
LUS_promote_religion_desc:0 "One of the peasants’ most redeeming qualities is their piety. This is something we can use to our advantage. By allying with the priesthood, we can spread fear of Godless communism. They seek to end our way of life and deny the Gods. Our Prince, on the other hand, has been given the right to rule by Boreas himself. The claws of the Gods should finally put down the influence of the reds."

LUS_new_recruiting_law:0 "The Reformed Recruiting Law"
LUS_new_recruiting_law_desc:0 "We need more griffons for the army. Peasant, commoner, noble. It doesn’t matter. The expanded recruiting law will not make our people happy. But, they must accept their sacrifice for the good of the nation. As Beakolini teaches, a griffon’s life is worth nothing. It is only the spirit of the nation that matters."

LUS_proclaim_new_kingdom:0 "Proclaim New Kingdom"
LUS_proclaim_new_kingdom_desc:0 "Lushi is finally recovering and becoming a great nation once again. It is time to assume our role as one of the great nations of the world. The title Prince is simply not fitting for Gerar. Therefore, let him be known as King Gerar Whitecrest. Long live the Kingdom of Lushi! We will bleed and die for you!"

LUS_new_lands:0 "The Lushian Nation"
LUS_new_lands_desc:0 "Our neighbours are weak and undeserving of their independence. The Lushian Nation should stretch well beyond our current borders. Our people are ready for noble conflict and our new enemies will be absorbed into our grand Kingdom."

 #Prince Gerar's Empire
LUS_war_research_effort:0 "Buy What's Cheap Today"
LUS_war_research_effort_desc:0 "We have to admit that our budget is running dry. Therefore, we must show Lushian ingenuity. Let’s see what is cheap and available on the market today and use that equipment to our advantage."

LUS_prywhen_peasants_to_work:0 "Force Prywhen Peasants to Work"
LUS_prywhen_peasants_to_work_desc:0 "The people of Prywhen have resisted, but have proven to be inferior to Lushi. Now we will claim the right of the strongest. The conquered will now work for the conquerors, whatever the cost. We need those factories working."

LUS_oil_of_the_marsh:0 "Resources of the Marsh"
LUS_oil_of_the_marsh_desc:0 "The marshes of Prywhen have been unused for the longest of time. Neglecting their land like this really shows that these griffons had no business ruling on their own. With hard labour and infallible purpose, we will make those marshes into a useful part of our Nation."

LUS_fuel_the_war_industry:0 "Fuel the War Machine"
LUS_fuel_the_war_industry_desc:0 "Although our nation is prepared, our industry could use an expansion. One never knows when a war goes the wrong way and we will require extra factories to fill in the gap. Let us add some fuel to power the war machine."

LUS_match_the_industry:0 "Folyo Project"
LUS_match_the_industry_desc:0 "We must match the infrastructure and technology of the great powers on the continent. The Folyo project will use both spies and science to further our own goals. It is imperative that this project is completely secret. Our enemies must not find out that we are stealing their ideas for our own use."

LUS_lumium_kivessin_railroad:0 "Lumium Kivessin Railroad"
LUS_lumium_kivessin_railroad_desc:0 "With Prywhen firmly in our claws, it is time to connect the big cities of Greater-Lushi with each other. The railroad will have to travel through some inhospitable land, but our engineers will pull through and deliver a beautiful railroad. And of course, the King himself will ensure that the trains run on time."

LUS_prepare_for_war:0 "Everything for the War Effort"
LUS_prepare_for_war_desc:0 "We have made up our mind. Lushi is going to war. But a people can only win a conflict if their entire spirit, their entire being even, supports the war. With unwavering zeal, we will work for our victory. Our soldiers will fight, while our people will work for their victory."

LUS_integrate_the_host:0 "Integrate the Host"
LUS_integrate_the_host_desc:0 "The Cossacks have always lacked strong leadership. Even though their individual people may have been strong, they lacked guidance. Now that their lands have fallen to us, we will integrate them into Lushi. Once we show them our power, surely the griffons of the Host will gladly join our Kingdom."

LUS_take_the_riches_of_gru:0 "Steal the Riches of Gryphus"
LUS_take_the_riches_of_gru_desc:0 "Gryphus is a pitiful state with no right to exist. We have done the world a favour by cleaning that stain on the world map. Luckily for us, the Gryphus treasury was far from empty. We should make sure to transfer that wealth to Lumium for safekeeping."

LUS_conscript_the_cossacks:0 "Conscript the Cossacks"
LUS_conscript_the_cossacks_desc:0 "The hardy Cossacks will make a wonderful addition to our army. However, catching them on the great plains of their homeland will be hard. By expanding the Cossack register, we can discover who actually lives on our land and make sure the Cossacks join our army."

LUS_force_the_gryphus_peasants_to_work:0 "Force Gryphus Peasants to Work"
LUS_force_the_gryphus_peasants_to_work_desc:0 "The people of Gryphus are pathetic and they easily succumbed to Lushi. The lives of its inhabitants now belong to us. They will be mustered into our grand army and put to work in a new factory."

LUS_empire_realized:0 "Empire Realized"
LUS_empire_realized_desc:0 "In the struggle of Nations, Lushi has come out on top. Led by our illustrious King Gerar Whitecrest, we have taken our homeland to greatness. Our lands stretch from Stripeport to Lumium, an enormous swath of land. Therefore our King deserves to truly be crowned Emperor! May the Lushian Empire last a thousand years!"

 #Shared Dealing with Nobles
LUS_what_are_you_unhappy_about:0 "Time is Running Out"
LUS_what_are_you_unhappy_about_desc:0 "We have an opportunity now, at the start of the Prince’s reign, to actually implement reforms. First of all, we need to deal with the problems of a couple of stubborn nobles. Lord Drak, Lord Matton and Lord Rosefeather."

LUS_approach_drak:0 "Approach Drak"
LUS_approach_drak_desc:0 "Lord Marven Drak controls a lot of fiefs from which most of the knights and levies of the realm come from. Lately we have been noticing that recruits don’t reach the army anymore. Although the Lord denies it, the Prince knows that he has his eyes on Princess Mira, even though she is way younger than him. We can approach him, or find another way."

LUS_drak_marriage:0 "Drak's Marriage"
LUS_drak_marriage_desc:0 "We have agreed to offer Princess Mira as tribute to Drak. Now we have to plan the wedding. It will not be a fun affair for our family, although Drak is apparently looking forward to it."

LUS_resolve_the_situation_in_damoi:0 "Resolve the Situation in Cessabit"
LUS_resolve_the_situation_in_damoi_desc:0 "It seems that Lord Matton’s peasants in Cessabit are having a bad harvest and that’s why the Lord is unable to pay taxes. Aditionally, the lack of proper infrastructure makes sending food to the capital a costly undertaking. We should pay him a visit and see for ourselves what is going on. Until then, the rest of the country has to compensate for Cessabit’s inability to pay."

LUS_new_supplies_on_track:0 "Get Supplies Back on Track"
LUS_new_supplies_on_track_desc:0 "If Cessabit was actually connected to the rest of the country, this wouldn’t have happened. We will have to make some sacrifices to get supplies from Lord Matton’s estate back on track and modernise our supply routes. That way the country can function normally."

LUS_approach_talvonia:0 "Approach Talvona"
LUS_approach_talvonia_desc:0 "Talvona is mostly under control of Lord Rosefeather and nobles fealty to him. He is a popular griffon, who supports moderate reforms. He is not paying us his full tax, instead using the money to help his peasants. We can convince him of our good intentions and have the good Lord throw his support behind us."

LUS_pay_a_visit:0 "A Visit to Talvona"
LUS_pay_a_visit_desc:0 "To ensure Rosefeather that we mean well towards him and his people, we shall take some time to tour the fiefdom and explain our plans to the locals. With Talvonan support behind us, we will have taken an important step towards reforming the country."

LUS_create_lord_council:0 "The Diet of Lushi"
LUS_create_lord_council_desc:0 "Now that we have dealt with the most stubborn opposition from the Lords, we can reopen the Diet of Lushi, the ancient Council of nobles which decided on matters of great importance. By allowing the lords this autonomy, they should be willing to allow us access to their private armies, enlarging our recruitment pool."


 #Elias's Harmony
LUS_expand_public_branch:0 "State Affairs"
LUS_expand_public_branch_desc:0 "We should discuss matters of State in the Diet. Lushi’s Commoners are not leading a good life and some nobles want to fix this. Perhaps we can convince the Diet that changing our way of government before the commoners take matters into their own claws, is the surest way to preserve the nobles’ way of life."

LUS_predict_the_revolution:0 "Predict the Revolution"
LUS_predict_the_revolution_desc:0 "Prince Elias has managed to convince the Diet of Lushi on massive reforms. The nobles will pledge their support to a constitution and a democratic government. Prince Elias, Lord Rosefeather and some other nobles have banded together in the Prosperist faction, ready to lead Lushi towards harmony."

LUS_create_pairlament:0 "Open the National Assembly"
LUS_create_pairlament_desc:0 "The first step towards a democracy is to elect national representatives. These will be allowed legislative powers in the National Assembly of Lushi. Prince Elias is throwing himself at the task with an enthusiasm one wouldn’t expect from a monarch giving away power. However, the Prince is convinced that this is the best way to ensure the prosperity of Lushi for long after his own death."

LUS_invite_representatives:0 "Invite the Representatives"
LUS_invite_representatives_desc:0 "After a brief period of campaigning, the elections were held. The people came out in massive support for the Prosperists, a victory for the Prince. With the votes counted, we should get the representatives settled in Lumium and get to work!"

LUS_run_pairlamentary_elections_in_states:0 "Provincial Estates Elections"
LUS_run_pairlamentary_elections_in_states_desc:0 "The local estates, or assemblies, usually only represented some citygriffs and the nobility. We should make these bodies more representative too, with griffons elected from the commoners and peasants. With local representatives taking care of their needs alongside the nobles, the poor should have no reason to turn to radicalism."

LUS_lushian_constitution:0 "The Lushian Constitution"
LUS_lushian_constitution_desc:0 "Lord Rosefeather has been spending a long time in his study preparing a document that would give all of Lushi the most precious gift. Liberty. For hours on end the noble slaved away on the Constitution, based on examples from all over the world. We merely need to present the document to the National Assembly and soon, every being who finds themselves in Lushi, will be guaranteed a worthy set of rights."

LUS_crown_the_king:0 "Offer Elias the Crown"
LUS_crown_the_king_desc:0 "It will be hard for the Assembly to keep anything a secret from Prince Elias, but, this must be kept a surprise. The National Assembly has deemed Elias Whitecrest’s efforts for Lushi to be fitting of those of legendary Monarchs. Therefore, the people have decided to offer Elias the position of King. A coronation ceremony will be held inside the Whitecrest Castle, followed by a massive party!"

 #Elias's Reforms
LUS_catching_up:0 "Catching Up with\n the Industrial Powers"
LUS_catching_up_desc:0 "By making a sizable investment, we will be able to attract expert engineers and companies to Lushi to help us with industrialising the country. These griffons and ponies will want a large monetary incentive to come work here, but it is a price we are willing to pay for modernising the Kingdom."

LUS_construction_techniques:0 "New Building Techniques"
LUS_construction_techniques_desc:0 "Our construction workers need to learn the way of the future too. Stone and wood are replaced by steel and concrete. Shovels by bulldozers and muscles by cranes and other machinery. Let us master these new building techniques, so that we can make cheap homes and build factories more easily."

LUS_build_the_railines:0 "Connecting the Estates"
LUS_build_the_railines_desc:0 "Under Feudalism, the many estates and fiefs of Lushi were barely connected to each other and more or less self-sufficient. This autarky meant low living standards and a lack of understanding about the rest of the country. The railroads will ensure we can finally all live together and the world will open up, even to b peasants living in the most remote villages."

LUS_oil_of_damoi:0 "Exploit the Cessabit Oilfields"
LUS_oil_of_damoi_desc:0 "We have known about the oilfields in Cessabit for a while, but the government was afraid of giving away the mining rights, since our technological backwardness could mean a company could force a bad deal on us. Now that we have the technology to do it ourselves, Lushians can enjoy the benefits of the Black Gold themselves."

LUS_oil_research:0 "Synthetic Oil Refineries"
LUS_oil_research_desc:0 "The fields in Cessabit are nice, but not enough to support our growing oil-powered economy alone. Luckily alchemy has come far since the time we tried turning lead into gold. We can now transmute several substances into usable oil. The transformation process is hard and requires special plants, but it just might be what we need."

LUS_rubber_program:0 "Rubber Program"
LUS_rubber_program_desc:0 "Gryphem is a suitable place for Rubber plantations. The substance is used for tires and is not only important for the civilian economy, but also for tracked vehicles and warplanes. Having our own supply would make our country that much safer, should we have to fight of a threat alone."

LUS_trucks:0 "’Kravon Automobile Company’"
LUS_trucks_desc:0 "Kravon Automobile Company, or KAC, is Lushi’s attempt to enter the car-market. Some of the brightest engineers in Lushi have started to figure out motorised vehicles from the very basics. As the first cars roll of the assembly lines, we could use their experience to research half-tracked half armoured vehicles to protect our troops in battle."

LUS_buy_trains_in_griffonia:0 "Trains of Griffonia"
LUS_buy_trains_in_griffonia_desc:0 "Sadly we can’t make enough trains ourselves to fulfil the demand for trains by both the military and the civilians. We will have to purchase some older trains from abroad. Hopefully our neighbours will give us a fair price."

LUS_the_rise_of_proper_industry:0 "The Lushian Boom"
LUS_the_rise_of_proper_industry_desc:0 "Our economic potential is finally being reached! All our investments are starting to pay off as more and more of our peasants find work in the expanding industrial sector. Business is booming and we just have to watch and enjoy the humming of hard work in the factories."

LUS_fridges_in_every_house:0 "Fridges in Every House"
LUS_fridges_in_every_house_desc:0 "Refrigeration is an amazing technology. Being able to store food and drinks for longer will make it so less food goes to waste. In effect, getting fridges in every home will mean that less factories will have to be used to package food, which will increase our industry somewhat."

LUS_quality_of_life:0 "Quality of Life"
LUS_quality_of_life_desc:0 "King Elias’s primary goal has always been to increase the commoners’ quality of life. To actually make them enjoy their time on this world, instead of just surviving. With the modernisation and democratisation efforts, he has actually made it happen. Now we can distribute some of our newfound wealth to the griffons. "

LUS_military_of_the_region:0 "Defend What is Dear to Us"
LUS_military_of_the_region_desc:0 "We have made amazing progress ever since the King came to power in Lushi. Sadly, our wealth might make our neighbours jealous. We must make sure to spend our new wealth prudently and not just on gifts to the population. Let all know that the Kingdom of Lushi will fight to defend what is dear to us!"

 #Shared Science
LUS_lord_military_staff:0 "Aristocratic Staff"
LUS_lord_military_staff_desc:0 "The Lords of Lushi have always commanded their own troops in the field. Commissions to lead troops were not always given by merit, but were also political appointments. It is wise to keep this system in place, since our nobles know both the art of defence and the art of politics."

LUS_new_military_staff:0 "Meritocratic Staff"
LUS_new_military_staff_desc:0 "Our noble officer corps simply is not sufficient. If we are to adapt to the needs of modern war, we will need specialised officers, not politicians, to lead our troops. Let us promote on merit, not class, from now on. Aside from improving the quality of our staff, it will also attract more hopeful commoners to the ranks, as they one day might be a general."


LUS_start_schooling_campaign:0 "Start Schooling Campaign"
LUS_start_schooling_campaign_desc:0 "The literacy rating in Lushi is absolutely abysmal. To do many modern jobs and operate machinery, a griffon needs to at least learn how to read and write. It will be a lengthy and costly process, but we should start schooling the peasants."

LUS_invite_scientists:0 "Foreign Scientists"
LUS_invite_scientists_desc:0 "We do not have the time to wait until our new schools produce new scientists, we need to improve our technology now. To that end, we should invite scientists from abroad to lead our own research divisions. But they may leave if we cause too much trouble for them, so let’s treat them nicely."

LUS_open_high_schools:0 "High Schools"
LUS_open_high_schools_desc:0 "With our griffons going into lower education, we are not there yet. We will have to open High Schools as well, so that we can actually train these literate griffons for useful professions."

LUS_medicine_college:0 "Lumium Medicine College"
LUS_medicine_college_desc:0 "The healthcare system in our country is not satisfactory, but we need somewhere to train our doctors and a place to produce medicine. The Lumium Medicine College will be that place. With laboratories, a hospital and plenty of staff, we will push Lushi to the forefront of medical technology."

LUS_poly_technical_college:0 "Poly-Technics"
LUS_poly_technical_college_desc:0 "We lack engineers, electricians and technicians, since we lack the facilities to train them. By investing in a Polytechnic system of tertiary education, Lushi will soon fill the shortage of technical griffons."

LUS_state_funded_science:0 "Fund the Sciences"
LUS_state_funded_science_desc:0 "With the facilities in place, our scientists have proposed all kinds of projects, but without funding, they will get nowhere. A system of distributing grants for research proposals will ensure that we will have a lot of experts available for government projects as well."

LUS_attempt_to_build_computer:0 "Attempt to Build a Computer"
LUS_attempt_to_build_computer_desc:0 "A computer is, at its core, an electronic calculator. But our engineers say that by figuring out the right language to speak to it and by giving the computer more calculating power, it could do much more than just add numbers. They say the computer could revolutionise the way we handle science and information."

LUS_magic_of_grass:0 "Magic of Grass"
LUS_magic_of_grass_desc:0 "The materialist science isn’t the only way we are making progress. Our research is also helping us to understand the age-old griffon magic. Lushi has always been a place of legend and myth. Magic is strong here and by researching the old manuscripts telling of the Magic of Grass, we might learn more about ourselves than by doing medical experiments."


 #Shared Military 
LUS_expand_military_branch:0 "Defence of the Realm"
LUS_expand_military_branch_desc:0 "With all the Lords at the table, we can now consider military affairs. Lushi has a rich history of knights and battles, but much of it has been lost as many of our Lords lost sight of their chivalrous ideals. Our plan is twofold. We will reinvigorate the knightly spirit in our nobles, while also building a modern army."

LUS_intensive_doctrine_research:0 "Extensive Doctrine Research"
LUS_intensive_doctrine_research_desc:0 "Instead of focusing our efforts on just one part of a doctrine, we should spread our efforts over a longer time. Although getting benefits now might be tempting, this might be a better long term plan."

LUS_form_the_royal_guard:0 "Instate The Royal Guard"
LUS_form_the_royal_guard_desc:0 "It is time for Lushi to once again be the beacon of chivalry it deserves to be. A first step is to form a royal guard of the most promising young nobles. While they will be a castle guard, most importantly, they will be thought the virtues and duties of a knight of old."

LUS_from_the_ancient_tales:0 "From The Ancient Tales"
LUS_from_the_ancient_tales_desc:0 "Every young griffon knows some of the legends of Lushi. The ancient tales of heroic knights fighting evil tyrants and dark monsters.

LUS_the_elite:0 "Finish the Guard’s Training"
LUS_the_elite_desc:0 "The Young Nobles of the Royal Guard have learned much from their training in Lumium. These valorous knights are now ready to serve Lushi and bring the fight to all the enemies of their sovereign!"

 #Shared Economics
LUS_expand_economic_branch:0 "Economic Affairs"
LUS_expand_economic_branch_desc:0 "Distributing economic resources between the nobles always causes heated debates, as the Lords all have their own ideas on how to improve the country and usually their own estate in particular. We should force the Lords to cooperate on this issue as well."

LUS_lushian_weaponry:0 "Erus Acel"
LUS_lushian_weaponry_desc:0 "We need to open a new armoury. Our many blacksmiths are known for their mastery of steel. Instead of swords, however, they will be making rifles. The modern infantry griffon will be armed by Erus Acel, the pride of Lushi!"

LUS_improve_the_quality_of_life:0 "Improve the Life of Peasants"
LUS_improve_the_quality_of_life_desc:0 "The endemic poverty that still rules in many parts of the realm needs to be solved. With investments, grants and projects the nobility can help improve the life of the commoners. We need to keep a good eye on their spending, however, to make sure the Lords don’t pocket the money."

LUS_steel_factory_in_gryphem:0 "Gryphem Steel Production"
LUS_steel_factory_in_gryphem_desc:0 "Gryphem has some unexploited iron deposits which the local Lord couldn’t use by himself. He has petitioned us to invest in a mine and a steel mill. It won’t just provide jobs, but it will also give us more access to crucial materials for warfare."

LUS_talvona_institute_of_industrial_research:0 "Talvonian Institute of Industry"
LUS_talvona_institute_of_industrial_research_desc:0 "Lord Rosefeather has always loved science. He has proposed to open a new institute in his estate. The researchers there will focus on supporting our burgeoning industrial sector. With another research institute in the country, we can expand our own research capacity as well."

LUS_rifle_masters:0 "Rifle Masters"
LUS_rifle_masters_desc:0 "Erus Acel has perfected the simple rifle to an art. The master blacksmiths have become masters of the rifle. The high demand for Lushian weaponry means that we can expand our production by constructing a new arsenal. The famed Lushian rifles also attract talent from other places, who in turn bring their own ideas and practices with them to complement our own technology."


 #Foreign Policy
LUS_befriend_prywhen:0 "Befriend Prywhen"
LUS_befriend_prywhen_desc:0 "It looks like the communist griffons of Prywhen are here to stay. This is a workable situation for us. By reaching out our claw in friendship, we might not only gain a powerful friend, but also get them to stop some of their operations in our country."

LUS_non_agression_pact:0 "Negotiate with Prywhen"
LUS_non_agression_pact_desc:0 "The leaders of the GLA seem more reasonable than we at first assumed. If we look away from their purges of nobles for a bit and focus on pragmatism, we should be able to work with them. We have but to convince their leadership that a non-aggression pact is in both our interests."

LUS_prywhen_trade_route:0 "Prywhen Trade Route"
LUS_prywhen_trade_route_desc:0 "Most of the world has closed their markets to Prywhen. This means that we have an opportunity to strike a lucrative trade deal. Surely these communists will not know much of economics, so we should be able to negotiate some favourable terms."

LUS_prywhen_research_treaty:0 "Prywhen Research Treaty"
LUS_prywhen_research_treaty_desc:0 "The Communists have made some interesting discoveries that might be of use to us. Our scientists are jumping at the opportunity to cooperate with Prywhen. Let us send a request to Prywhen and ask them for a scientific cooperation agreement."

LUS_prywhen_defence_pact:0 "Prywhen Defence Pact"
LUS_prywhen_defence_pact_desc:0 "It is clear that Prywhen and Lushi share many common enemies. Even though it might seem weird to bind our destiny to griffons who detest everything we stand for, it is the only way to ensure the safety of our nation. Surely our friends in the GLA will feel the same."

LUS_prywhen_volunteers:0 "Volunteers for Prywhen"
LUS_prywhen_volunteers_desc:0 "To assist our friends in the wars abroad, we can send some of our own communists as volunteers to Prywhen. Hopefully that will stop them from causing trouble here in Lushi. If they perish on the field of battle, good riddance to the troublemakers."

LUS_destroy_the_bandits:0 "Destroy the Bandits"
LUS_destroy_the_bandits_desc:0 "The bandits are a threat to the stability of both Prywhen and Lushi. We will take care of this petty excuse for a state and get a bit of land from it in return."


LUS_brodfeld_partners:0 "Partners in Brodfeld"
LUS_brodfeld_partners_desc:0 "We have many associates and friends in Brodfeld. They could get us into contact with their King in their hour of need. With a timely intervention, we can still stop the spread of communism in our vicinity."

LUS_help_brodfeld:0 "Aid the Rightful King"
LUS_help_brodfeld_desc:0 "We must restore the rightful King of Prywhen. These communists may think they have won, but we will crush these Godless reds and restore the Kingdom. We will be Boreas’s will and Arcturus’s sword!"

LUS_royal_marriage:0 "Whitecrest-Kissau Unity"
LUS_royal_marriage_desc:0 "Prince Tomado and Princess Mira have been seeing each other for a while now. With Brodfeld and Lushi as allies, we should endorse their marriage and unite the houses of Whitecrest and Kissau. Let the people celebrate this joyful union!"

LUS_claim_prywhen_north:0 "Claim Northern Prywhen"
LUS_claim_prywhen_north_desc:0 "It seems Brodfeld has managed to survive the insurgence. They are weakened now, still reeling from the communist attack. Let us strike now and regain some of our rightful land!"

LUS_question_brodfeld_rule:0 "Question Brodfeld's Rule"
LUS_question_brodfeld_rule_desc:0 "The incompetent King of Brodfeld has proven that he is incapable of ruling like a true Griffon Monarch. As the house with the closest ties to them, it is our job to protect Brodfeld. Let us start by questioning the House de Kissau in a public speech."

LUS_lushian_prywhen_king:0 "Lushian-Prywhen King"
LUS_lushian_prywhen_king_desc:0 "With their legitimacy crushed in the eyes of the world and in the spirit of their own people, the House de Kissau has no reason to exist anymore. We will offer them a chance to join us peacefully. If they refuse, we will have no choice but to put Brodfeld under our protection by force."

LUS_brodfeld_scientists:0 "Brodfeld Scientists"
LUS_brodfeld_scientists_desc:0 "The scientists of Brodfeld are an eccentric bunch. They are smart, but often focus on weird projects way ahead of their time. We can use their intelligence to our advantage, but it might aggravate our own scientists. So let us take care to not offend the Lushian or the Brodfeldian academia."

LUS_apropriate_prywhen_lands:0 "Appropriate Lands of Prywhen"
LUS_apropriate_prywhen_lands_desc:0 "The lands of Prywhen, much like our own, are owned by a number of noble estates. With our control over the country established, we should make sure that any rebellious nobles lose their land. This will not only increase stability, but also give us more resources to work with."

 #Extra Military
LUS_organize_strategic_planning:0 "The Lushi Institute for Strategic Studies"
LUS_organize_strategic_planning_desc:0 "We should study other, more modern militaries and their tactics, as well as ancient works on the art of warfare. By making a library and institute to amass this knowledge, we can figure out the best doctrine for a modern Lushian Army."

LUS_strategy_of_defence:0 "Defensive Strategy"
LUS_strategy_of_defence_desc:0 "We have no use for wars of conquest. We should concentrate our efforts on making sure that no other country declares war on us. The concept of deterrence will help us with this. By making our military so hard to defeat that a war would cost more than our country can offer an enemy, no enemy would want to attack us."

LUS_strategy_of_offence:0 "Offensive Strategy"
LUS_strategy_of_offence_desc:0 "Wars cannot be won by standing still. Our troops must be brave and take the war to the enemy. By fighting on other peoples’ land, we protect our own from any serious harm. Our military should focus on the offence and the tactics that best suit this."

LUS_the_great_plan:0 "To Plan a Victory"
LUS_the_great_plan_desc:0 "The Institute for Strategic Studies has found many works which state that planning is key. Indeed, has a creative plan not been the key in many a knight’s victory over evil? By planning and drilling every detail of combat, we will make the enemy fight on our terms."

LUS_the_massive_army:0 "The King's Army"
LUS_the_massive_army_desc:0 "The commoners have been long neglected in Griffonian warfare. All the focus was on the noble knight and their gallant charges. However, a rifle can kill a griffon from hundreds of meters away and an artillery shell murders without regard for social class. Therefore, numbers and mass will mean victory. It is a harsh truth, but a truth we must accept."

LUS_defensive_bunkers:0 "Defensive Bunkers"
LUS_defensive_bunkers_desc:0 "We should construct fortifications along the borders with our enemies. By appointing flexible construction crews for a long time, we can quickly decide which part of our country needs to be fortified against our many neighbours."

LUS_new_artillery:0 "Modern Artillery"
LUS_new_artillery_desc:0 "What our doctrine may be, modern artillery will have a role to play in our strategy. Artillery can destroy an enemy without putting any of our griffons in danger, whether you are attacking or defending. It is imperative that Lushi stays on top of artillery developments."

LUS_new_infantry_doctrine:0 "New Infantry Doctrine"
LUS_new_infantry_doctrine_desc:0 "Infantry is the mainstay of every army, even the most modern ones. By focussing on amassing firepower and how to most effectively bringing it to bear against the enemy, we will be able to turn a tactical advantage into a strategic victory. Barrages from our artillery will smash any resistance to our valiant soldiers’ advance."

LUS_new_mobile_doctrine:0 "New Mobile Doctrine"
LUS_new_mobile_doctrine_desc:0 "Tanks are the knights of the future! A core of armoured vehicles will be the tip of our lance. Like the knights of old our panzer forces will dominate the battlefield. For this to become a reality we must develop a doctrine based on speed and aggressiveness."

LUS_tanks:0 "Li-1 and Rico Design Study"
LUS_tanks_desc:0 "We should study some of the most famous tanks from the continent. Some light tanks will already be a massive improvement over no tanks at all. Fast and with machineguns and cannons, tanks are a true terrifying weapons platform!"


 #Shared Aircraft
LUS_griffon_aviation_effort:0 "Lushi Flies High"
LUS_griffon_aviation_effort_desc:0 "For the defence of the realm, we will need aircraft, one of the modern machines of warfare. Fast and versatile, combat planes are the key to victory. Before we can start production, we will need to build an airfield to house our craft and decide on a doctrine."

LUS_griffon_fighter_focus:0 "Fighter Focus"
LUS_griffon_fighter_focus_desc:0 "We should focus our efforts on the most humble of planes, the fighter craft. Specifically made to fight other planes, this plane will protect our skies from any enemy who dares enter it"

LUS_griffon_fighter_focus_2:0 "Fighter Focus II"
LUS_griffon_fighter_focus_2_desc:0 "It is time for a more modern fighter. With better guns and most importantly, a more powerful engine, we can make our fighters that more nimble. Conquering the skies is imperative if we are to win any conflict and the Lushian Flyer corps will make good use of the works of craftsmanship that are modern fighters."

LUS_griffon_bomber_focus:0 "Bomber Focus"
LUS_griffon_bomber_focus_desc:0 "Our enemies might focus on shooting down planes, but griffons still do live most of their lives on the ground. By equipping bombs on our aircraft, we will destroy any enemies on the ground."

LUS_griffon_bomber_focus_2:0 "Bomber Focus II"
LUS_griffon_bomber_focus_2_desc:0 "Next to normal bombers, we should also consider close air support. These aircraft are specifically designed to take down ground troop formations and spread disorganisation amongst the enemy. Alternatively, we could continue with bigger bombers, who can effectively destroy enemy infrastructure as well."

LUS_griffon_aviation_effort_2:0 "Lushian Aviation"
LUS_griffon_aviation_effort_2_desc:0 "With our plane designs complete, we should return back to the question of doctrine. With a larger air force comes the challenge of commanding and controlling the swarms of planes available. Whichever strategy we choose, Lushi should be careful to not neglect air-officers and support staff."

LUS_griffon_purchase_foreign:0 "Purchase Foreign Aircraft"
LUS_griffon_purchase_foreign_desc:0 "It will take too much effort to make our own aircraft design. Luckily, there are still nations on this earth who are friendly to us. By paying enough goods, we will be able to purchase foreign designs, which are as good as anything we could come up with on our own."

#Lushian Greatness
lushi.1.t:0 "The Celebration of Lushian Greatness!"
lushi.1.d:0 "The Greatness of Lushi knows no bounds! The best griffons live in the land of Lushi! It is the nicest place of all Griffonia! Let's drink and dance all night long to celebrate this new wonderful holiday!"
lushi.1.b:0 "Hurray!"

lushi.2.t:0 "Lushian Knights have come!"
lushi.2.d:0 "The knights remember the feast that we organized to celebrate Lushian greatness. Now they have come to help us in our time of need. Clad in ancient enchanted armour, wearing lances with bright banners showing the old colours of the Lushian fiefs. This magnificent sight has revitalised the country and gave us confidence that we can win this war. Let us sing the praise of our Gallant Knights forevermore! Let us rally to our paladins!"
lushi.2.a:0 "Splendid!"
lushi.2.b:0 "Outstanding!"
lushi.2.c:0 "Magnificent!"
lushi.2.d:0 "Fantastic!"

#Lord Drak
lushi.3.t:0 "Lord Drak’s Proposal"
lushi.3.d:0 "The influential Lord Drak is one of the most powerful nobles of the realm. He is old and despicable in every way. So far, he has refused to help [Root.GetLeader] in reforming the country. Rumours and whispers speak of his price. The Lord wishes to marry Princess Mira, Elias’s daughter! The very thought of having to spend the rest of her life with this griffon has made the princess sick and sad. However, according to Griffonian traditions, the man of the household decides about marriages. The Prince is now stuck between his wishes for reform and the heart of Princess Mira.\n\nDrak came to the Castle at Lumium with a large entourage and he negotiated with [Root.GetLeader] for hours, with Mira watching the proceedings silently. Lord Drak, however, remained obstinate. His final proposal was as it is. Mira’s claw, for his support. . ."
lushi.3.a:0 "I have no choice but to agree."
lushi.3.b:0 "You will never lay your dirty claws on Mira!"

lushi.4.t:0 "A Political Marriage"
lushi.4.d:0 "Many Lords and Notables from all over Lushi arrived at Lord Drak’s Castle in the Northwest of the country. Today was to be the marriage of Mira Whitecrest and Marven Drak himself. The flowers, carpets and other decorations couldn’t hide that the fortress was usually a far grimmer place. None of the guests reflected the castle better than [Root.GetLeader] and Princess Mira as they looked as grey as the castle’s walls. ‘It is for the future of Lushi, there was no other choice.’ The Prince muttered to Mira as he prepared to walk the beautiful bride down the aisle.\n’Can’t you just. . . get rid of him?’ Mira whispered back, her eyes still seemed hopeful for some kind of miracle, but [Root.GetLeader] shook his head. He took her by the claw when a servant signalled that it was time. ‘I’m sorry.’\n\nMira and Drak were together now, standing in front of the priest of Eyr. The holy griffon repeated the vows for both of them. ‘Yes.’ The Lord answered, with an unbearable sadistic joy in his voice.\n’Yes.’ The Lady said, softly, trying to look happy in front of the crowd. The priest gave a worried glance to the new couple, as if he could sense what was really going on, but he did proceed. ‘Then you are now husband and wife. May Eyr watch over your union.’"
lushi.4.a:0 "May Eyr watch over their union. . ."

lushi.5.t:0 "Lord Drak of Veritas"
lushi.5.d:0 "The Northwestern lands of Lushi, which border our own country, have been under control of the Drak family for some time now. It seems that the prince of Lushi has somehow gravely insulted Lord Malvin Drak, however. So much so, that the noblegriffon seeks to sever his vassalage to Lushi. In a formal letter bearing his seal, Lord Drak swears fealty to [Root.GetLeader] and wants his domain to become a part of [Root.GetName]. We have to consider this proposal carefully, as it might lead to problems with Lushi."
lushi.5.a:0 "He is more than welcome!"
lushi.5.b:0 "We don't need problems."

lushi.6.t:0 "Lord Draks of Veritas left us"
lushi.6.d:0 "News came that Lord Draks has sworn fealty to [From.GetLeader] and his country became the property of his new overlord. In a letter in which he explains his actions, he states that a Lord, if his honour is in jeopardy, can renounce his vassalage and find another protector. This might have something to do with the Prince’s refusal to have Drak marry Princess Mira."
lushi.6.a:0 "That worm."

lushi.7.t:0 "Drak's Castle Captured!"
lushi.7.d:0 "Our siege of Drak’s Castle was successful! Our troops seized the walls, making their way to the keep itself. Although the resistance of Drak’s goons, supported by his new overlord’s troops, was fierce, they did not manage to deter our brave knights and soldiers. Step by step they fought their way up the keep’s tower, until they finally found Drak. Clad in heavy armour and wearing a mace, the Lord managed to kill three knights before finally being overpowered. After the Castle was taken, Lushian troops once again controlled the entire state surrounding it. A quick peace deal was made to end the conflict, the castle clearly being much more trouble than it was worth for our enemies. Lushi has won the day!"
lushi.7.a:0 "Wonderful!"

lushi.8.t:0 "Our forces repelled"
lushi.8.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, the siege of Drak’s Castle has failed. The might of his own levy along with the forces of his overlord and the fortifications proved to be too much for our brave forces. Although we managed to overwhelm much of the state and even the castle walls, we could not seize the Keep. Drak himself, still using an ancient mace, managed to turn the tide at the last second. Our losses were simply too high to justify any further assaults. Drak has won his independence from Lushi. . ."
lushi.8.a:0 "Awful"

lushi.9.t:0 "Siege broken off"
lushi.9.d:0 "Due to a lack of troops assigned to the siege works, our general has not managed to properly besiege Drak’s Castle. With extra reinforcements from the rest of his new country coming in, we have lost our opportunity to regain the stolen state."
lushi.9.a:0 "We didn’t go through with it"

lushi.38.t:0 "Under the Cover of Darkness"
lushi.38.d:0 "Our assassin has managed to sneak into the castle via the sewers. Of course everything in Drak’s Castle stinks, so the difference was barely noticeable. Now, our assassin needs to make his way to the Lord’s bedchamber and decide on his strategy. Unless, of course, he gets cold claws."
lushi.38.a:0 "Poison him"
lushi.38.b:0 "Shoot him"
lushi.38.c:0 "Strangle him in his sleep"
lushi.38.e:0 "Recall the Assassin now!"

lushi.39.t:0 "Assassination Successful!"
lushi.39.d:0 "Lord Drak has perished and the assassin has made a safe getaway. Our part in the plot will remain hidden and Mira won’t have to spend any time being that old crook’s partner."
lushi.39.a:0 "To Tartarus with you"

lushi.40.t:0 "Assassination Failed!"
lushi.40.d:0 "Through some twist of fate, Malvin Drak has survived! Luckily our griffon got away safely, ensuring the secrecy of our plot."
lushi.40.a:0 "Too bad."

lushi.41.t:0 "Our Assassin was Captured!"
lushi.41.d:0 "Our plan went horribly! Not only did Lord Drak survive, he managed to alarm his guards and capture the assassin. Let’s hope we can somehow deny involvement in trying to murder one of our own vassals."
lushi.41.a:0 "We made a mistake."

#Peasants War
lushi.14.t:0 "Peasants refuse to work"
lushi.14.d:0 "Our continuation of the harsh serfdom of old seems to have had the opposite effect we desired. The peasants, encouraged by similar revolutions across the continent, refuse to work! Even worse, they are stealing weapons from armouries and plaguing the countryside. We still have a little while before the situation spirals out of our control, but we must somehow regain the commoners’ trust before they overthrow our government!"
lushi.14.a:0 "Did we push them too far?"

lushi.15.t:0 "The Peasants War!"
lushi.15.d:0 "A mass revolt has occurred throughout the countryside. Peasants occupied towns and villages, armed with firearms and sometimes just pitchforks and torches. Many soldiers are sympathetic to them and have rallied to their side. The mob is now marching towards the last remaining aristocratic strongholds, determined to earn their freedom by force!"
lushi.15.a:0 "Fight the mob!"
lushi.15.b:0 "Join the revolution!"

#I like Trains
lushi.16.t:0 "Purchase Trains Abroad"
lushi.16.d:0 "A modern country relies on railroads to transport passengers and goods. Although we have some connections between our major towns, we still lack enough trains to make the routes stable and useful. Let us procure trains from abroad and finally drag our country out of the Feudal age!"
lushi.16.a:0 "Spread the word!"

lushi.17.t:0 "Lushi offers train deal."
lushi.17.d:0 "The government of [LUS.GetNameDef] offers us a trade deal, they would like to buy several trains from our country to improve the life of their citizens and further modernize their own country. They are willing to pay a good price for the trains!"
lushi.17.a:0 "Deal."
lushi.17.b:0 "No deal."

lushi.18.t:0 "[From.GetName] accepted the deal."
lushi.18.d:0 "[From.GetName] has decided to let us buy several of their old trains! This will certainly solve all the infrastructure problems we are facing right now. The only thing left is to confirm the deal."
lushi.18.a:0 "We agree!"
lushi.18.b:0 "I’d rather buy them from another country."

lushi.19.t:0 "[From.GetName] signs the deal."
lushi.19.d:0 "The government of Lushi signed the deal and the trains we have prepared for them are now on the way to Lushian lands. We should expect their payment shortly. Let us hope this only strengthens the friendship between us!"
lushi.19.a:0 "A good deal."

lushi.20.t:0 "Lushi signs deal with [From.GetName]"
lushi.20.d:0 "The government of [LUS.GetNameDef] has purchased trains in [From.GetNameDef]. They have sent us a polite letter explaining that [From.GetNameDef] had a better deal at this time. It seems we can’t win them all."
lushi.20.a:0 "That’s a shame."

lushi.21.t:0 "[From.GetName] refuse train deal"
lushi.21.d:0 "The greedy government of [From.GetName] has decided to refuse our most generous deal. It seems that they need their old trains for themselves. No matter, we’ll find another seller."
lushi.21.a:0 "Fine."

#Not a griffonian nation without an economic crash
lushi.22.t:0 "Agriculture Crisis"
lushi.22.d:0 "Freeing the peasants from their serfdom has made the price of food soar as peasants need to be paid more and some have decided to flock to the cities for other jobs. The ones who are left haven’t contributed enough food to feed the growing population of the cities. Our granaries are still full from previous years, but a crisis looms on the horizon. . ."
lushi.22.a:0 "We’ll get through this"

lushi.23.t:0 "Crisis of Transformation"
lushi.23.d:0 "As more efficient ways of farming are forming, the rich peasants are getting richer, but the poorer peasants are getting poorer and more numerous. The griffons don't have jobs and don't have the money to buy the things that the rich produce. We must organize more workplaces, enact market regulations and support the smaller farmers."
lushi.23.a:0 "Let’s get to work!"

lushi.24.t:0 "Grain Deal from Lushi"
lushi.24.d:0 "[LUS.GetName] wants to buy quality grain in our country. It seems that their country is running the risk of a famine. We currently have a food surplus and can afford to be generous. Should we oblige and help Lushi?"
lushi.24.a:0 "Yes, they can buy it."
lushi.24.b:0 "No, we should not."

lushi.25.t:0 "[From.GetName] sells us grain"
lushi.25.d:0 "We have been saved! [From.GetName] has decided to generously allow us to buy up some of their grain reserves. The food is already on its way to the most affected areas. Soon no griffon will have to go hungry again."
lushi.25.a:0 "Thank Eyr."

lushi.26.t:0 "[From.GetName] rejects deal."
lushi.26.d:0 "We are still in dire straits, as [From.GetName] has sadly refused to sell us grain. They say that they need the food themselves and that even though they are sympathetic to our plight, that they cannot provide any assistance at this time. Let us hope that our luck improves."
lushi.26.a:0 "Let us pray"

lushi.27.t:0 "Food is running out"
lushi.27.d:0 "`The lack of food imports, along with the bad harvests, has meant that our food reserves are depleting fast. With strict rationing we might be able to keep every griffon alive for a while, but the strong are already becoming weaker and our country is suffering. We must act now to save the lives of our people!"
lushi.27.a:0 "Gods preserve us. . ."

lushi.28.t:0 "Famine takes over the country"
lushi.28.d:0 "With our fields still not putting out enough food to feed our people and with no help from abroad, we cannot save every griffon anymore. Our griffons have resorted to eating anything even mildly digestible, but their strength is completely sapped. Some have already been taken by the great famine. Our country is barely operational right now. We should pray for the dead and pray that our suffering may end soon, one way or the other."
lushi.28.a:0 "Eyr damned us!"

#War with Prywhen
lushi.30.t:0 "The Peasants are unhappy"
lushi.30.d:0 "As we've entered the war against Prywhen, more and more peasants start to share rebellious sentiment for they believe the same can happen to them. We should keep an eye on them and make sure that they do not catch us unawares, as the peasants of Prywhen did with the Lords of Brodfeld"
lushi.30.a:0 "Keep an eye on them"

lushi.31.t:0 "War Measures"
lushi.31.d:0 "As we've entered the war against Prywhen, the terrible situation of our economy has revealed. We do not have money to finance both the military and civilian construction projects. What do we focus on?"
lushi.31.a:0 "Construct. The army will manage."
lushi.31.b:0 "We only need more guns."
lushi.31.c:0 "Share the money between these two."

#Gerar's Recruiting Law
lushi.37.t:0 "We can enact the New Recruiting Law again"
lushi.37.d:0 "We decided to lax the recruitment law for a while to give our people some breathing room. If we desire to, however, we can instate the harsher recruitment law again. This will make our people unhappy, but it will provide us with more able-bodied griffons for our army."
lushi.37.a:0 "Very well."


#Prywhen Events
lushi_prywhen.1.t:0 "[LUS.GetNameDef] offers friendship"
lushi_prywhen.1.d:0 "[LUS.GetNameDef] wants to establish an embassy in our land. They cite sympathies for the suffering of the peasants of Prywhen and list reforms in their own country which would prevent the peasants in Lushi to suffer the same fate. Furthermore, they list common interests such as trade and defence as good reasons to cooperate. However, their country is ruled by a prince and nobles and we still have contact with supporters trying to rally communism in Lushi too. Do we accept this offer?"
lushi_prywhen.1.a:0 "Let’s show our open mindedness."
lushi_prywhen.1.b:0 "Your head would look good on the end of a stick!"

lushi_prywhen.2.t_frnd:0 "Embassy in GLA"
lushi_prywhen.2.t_no_frnd:0 "Embassy in GLA denied"
lushi_prywhen.2.d_frnd:0 "It seems these peasants are more reasonable than we give them credit for. They have accepted our offer and we established formal diplomatic contact with Prywhen. The old Kissau’s might not like this, but it is better to bet on the winning side."
lushi_prywhen.2.d_no_frnd:0 "These peasants are as stupid as their ideology! They have refused our claw in friendship merely because of ideological reasons. Their response was an insult and almost enough of a reason for war in its own right. It seems we overestimated the pragmatism of the Griffon Liberation Army"
lushi_prywhen.2.a:0 "Great"
lushi_prywhen.2.b:0 "Prepare for a possible attack"

lushi_prywhen.3.t:0 "Non-Agression Pact from Lushi"
lushi_prywhen.3.d:0 "The bourgeoisie and imperialists of Lushi are back with a new proposal. It seems that they are afraid of the people’s army and seek a non-aggression pact with us. One the one hand, this would defend one of our most vulnerable flanks from invasion, on the other hand, such ad deal might be a massive disappointment to those oppressed griffons in Lushi."
lushi_prywhen.3.a:0 "We must be pragmatic, accept."
lushi_prywhen.3.b:0 "We cannot abandon principals, decline."

lushi_prywhen.4.t:0 "Prywhen Accepts"
lushi_prywhen.4.d:0 "The communists have accepted a mutual non-aggression pact. We can rest soundly at night, knowing that the red tide will leave our home alone."
lushi_prywhen.4.a:0 "Good."

lushi_prywhen.5.t:0 "Prywhen Declines"
lushi_prywhen.5.d:0 "It appears that the communists have plans to attack us after all, since they are not willing to sign a binding pact of non-aggression. Very well, if they come, we will be ready."
lushi_prywhen.5.a:0 "There's nothing we can do."

lushi_prywhen.6.t:0 "Lushi Trade Route"
lushi_prywhen.6.d:0 "Lushi wants to support our friendship by establishing a trade route between our countries. This deal will be beneficial to both of our countries. But, should we really accept goods made by bourgeois imperialists? Should we really profit of the oppression of others?"
lushi_prywhen.6.a:0 "We will use these funds for good!"
lushi_prywhen.6.b:0 "No."

lushi_prywhen.7.t:0 "[From.GetName] accepts the deal"
lushi_prywhen.7.d:0 "The trade routes between our countries are established! The communists have opened their towns to trade with us, giving us an exclusive advantage in selling goods from Prywhen to the world market! This will help our economy tremendously."
lushi_prywhen.7.a:0 "Great!"

lushi_prywhen.9.t:0 "Peaceful Research with Lushi"
lushi_prywhen.9.d:0 "The nobles of Lushi have asked for our help yet again. They want us to sign a research treaty, working together on important research. Will we accept their help to make the world a better place?"
lushi_prywhen.9.a:0 "Of course!"
lushi_prywhen.9.b:0 "No need to share our knowledge with bourgeois"

lushi_prywhen.10.t:0 "Prywhen Accepts!"
lushi_prywhen.10.d:0 "The communists have accepted our mutual research program!"
lushi_prywhen.10.a:0 "Hurray!"

lushi_prywhen.11.t:0 "The Kivessin Defence Pact!"
lushi_prywhen.11.d:0 "Lushi is now seeking a mutual defence treaty. Effectively they want to form a faction together, called the Kivessin defence pact. Although Lushi has proven to be a reliable friend in the past, many of our comrades are uneasy about cooperating with a monarchy."
lushi_prywhen.11.a:0 "For the Revolution!"
lushi_prywhen.11.b:0 "We will never fight with imperialists!"
#Brodfeld Events
lushi_brodfeld.1.t:0 "[LUS.GetLeader] holds a speech against Brodfeld!"
lushi_brodfeld.1.d:0 "[LUS.GetLeader] made a speech in front of a crowd in Lumium today. He exclaimed that the King in Brodfeld lost his right to rule right when he let the communist revolution take place. The House de Kissau cannot be trusted as they will inevitably plunge Prywhen into another bloody civil war. The people of all Prywhen should accept [LUS.GetLeader] as their ruler for everlasting peace and prosperity."
lushi_brodfeld.1.a:0 "That is definitely so!"
lushi_brodfeld.1.a_brf:0 "That is outrageous!"

lushi_brodfeld.2.t:0 "Lushi Demands Our Kingdom!"
lushi_brodfeld.2.d:0 "[LUS.GetLeader] just sent a letter to us, saying that our rule over Prywhen is illegitimate and we should abdicate in favour of a King from house Whitecrest! The document, carrying the Lushian seal, lists our alleged crimes against good rulership and against our own people. While these are clearly forged, it seems like Lushi has set its sights on our country. Do we bend, or throw Prywhen into another bloody conflict?"
lushi_brodfeld.2.a:0 "We must bend."
lushi_brodfeld.2.c:0 "Send them a highly cultured letter!"
lushi_brodfeld.2.b:0 "This means War!"

lushi_brodfeld.3.t:0 "Brodfeld bends over!"
lushi_brodfeld.3.d:0 "In a display of their true courage, the King of Brodfeld has decided to bend for us. He has formally given all his titles to [LUS.GetLeader] and reluctantly gave the Prince his blessing. A glorious day for the house of Whitecrest!"
lushi_brodfeld.3.a:0 "His country is wide open!"

lushi_brodfeld.4.t:0 "Message from the King of Brodfeld"
lushi_brodfeld.4.d:0 ""Most esteemed ruler of Lushi, I hereby give the following reply to your humble request. SUCK MY ****, you greedy *****son. May Boreas have mercy on your soul, for you will certainly not have a body left when I am done with you!""
lushi_brodfeld.4.a:0 "We won’t ask nicely next time!"

lushi_brodfeld.5.t:0 "King of Brodfeld declared war on us!"
lushi_brodfeld.5.d:0 "The King of Brodfeld shows his short temper yet again. They simply responded to our request with a declaration of war! Of course we expected this outcome and now history will remember them as the aggressor."
lushi_brodfeld.5.a:0 "To Victory!"

lushi_brodfeld.6.t:0 "Coronation of [LUS.GetLeader]!"
lushi_brodfeld.6.d:0 "With the unification of Lushi and Prywhen, [LUS.GetLeader] will be crowned as the King of Lushi and the King of Brodfeld! This United Kingdom will stand among the great powers of Griffonia! May Boreas bless Lushi and Brodfeld!"
lushi_brodfeld.6.a:0 "Hail to the King!"

lushi_brodfeld.7.t:0 "Payment for the Help"
lushi_brodfeld.7.d:0 "The Prince of Lushi has demanded a price for their help in the civil war. Do we give in to their outrageously high demands?"
lushi_brodfeld.7.a:0 "Pay the full price."
lushi_brodfeld.7.b:0 "Half or nothing, Whitecrest."
lushi_brodfeld.7.c:0 "Don't pay at all."

lushi_brodfeld.8.t:0 "Brodfeld Pays for the Help"
lushi_brodfeld.8.d:0 "The King of Brodfeld has decided to pay the price for Lushian arms. It seems that he has seen reason after all. The de Kissaus can be trusted to uphold their bargains after all."
lushi_brodfeld.8.a:0 "Great."

lushi_brodfeld.9.t:0 "Brodfeld Pays for the Help"
lushi_brodfeld.9.d:0 "The King of Brodfeld has decided to pay the price for Lushian arms. It seems that he has seen reason after all. The de Kissaus sneakily halved the payment, however. What are these scheming sons of Maar up to?"
lushi_brodfeld.9.a:0 "What are they planning?"

lushi_brodfeld.10.t:0 "Brodfeld refuses to pay!"
lushi_brodfeld.10.d:0 "The King of Brodfeld has refused to pay what he owes us. We should never have trusted a Kissau! Perhaps we should turn Lushian arms on him then?"
lushi_brodfeld.10.a:0 "Outrageous!"

lushi_brodfeld.11.t:0 "Marriage Proposal Accepted!"

Prince Tomado and his father were accompanied by knights in colourful uniform, brandishing the banners of House Kissau. To match this, the Gallant Knights of Lushi also dressed up in the cheerful colours of the many nobles of the realm. To symbolise unity, knights from both countries had hanged their heraldic shields on the walls of the chapel where the ceremony would take place.\n\nThere was one star who outshone all these knights and ladies, however, the bride herself. After a herald announced them, [LUS.GetLeader] led the Princess into the overcrowded chapel in the Whitecrests’s ancestral home. Princess Mira was wearing a dress of the finest satins. On her head was a silver tiara, with a large sapphire stone set in the centre. None could keep their eyes of the dazzling royal, but no griffon in the room was as enchanted by her as Prince Tomado, however, eyes shone with unending love.\n\nAfter both bride and groom had arrived at the altar, the priest of Eyr repeated the vows of marriage. All who were present held their breath.\n’Yes,’ said the Prince, his voice dutiful but betraying a hint of nervousness.\n’Yes,’ exclaimed the Princess, who could barely contain herself.\n\n’Then you are now husband and wife. May Eyr watch over your union,’ the priest confirmed. As the two lovers moved to kiss each other, the nobles and notables of both countries erupted into cheers and applause. Love had not only brought these two lovers together, but both of their peoples as well. The party, both in the castle at Lumium and in the streets of all towns and villages in Brodfeld and Lushi, lasted until the sun rose up and deserves its place in legends in its own right.

An unknown griffon approached Prince Elias from above and shot him in the head with a Voderlader musket. The assassin was killed on sight by royal guards, so his political motivation remains unknown. Elias’s younger brother, Prince Gerar will take power in the country. He is known as an admirer of Wingbardian political theorist Beakolini and his rule might turn out way differently than that of his deceased brother."

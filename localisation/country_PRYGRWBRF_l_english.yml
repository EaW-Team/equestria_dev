GRW_red_knights_desc:0 "Whilst the knights are an institution of the old monarchy, there's no reason we cannot make our own knightly orders, loyal to our goals and aims, and the peoples of our socialist state. Such as force would be a boon to any army, and would heighten our military prestige."

GRW_artillery_effort:0 "Focus on Big Guns"
GRW_artillery_effort_desc:0 "We have spent time focusing on our smaller firearms. However, it is now time to focus on larger weapons, such as cannons and howitzers. Infantry weapons are fine and all, but artillery is a great boon to any and all forces we put into the field."

GRW_military_use_of_magic_desc:0 "While we griffons are unable to cast spells in the way that ponies and their kind are capable of doing so, there are still many military-applicable uses of magic and the like that we are quite capable of using, and to develop such tools and weapons would be an excellent idea."

GRW_aircraft:0 "Our Own Plane"

GRW_strategic_integrity:0 "Integrity of Efforts"
GRW_strategic_integrity_desc:0 "Now that we've begun to properly reform our military, we must maintain the integrity of our reformation efforts by continuing and improving our reformation, with even further reforms. We can stop when we're dead, after all."

GRW_foreign_tools:0 "Import of Industrial Machines"
GRW_foreign_tools_desc:0 "We should take the time to make deals with our more advanced neighbors both on this continent and across the water, to improve upon our industrial capacity by importing more advanced tools that we can then integrate into our industry. Over-all, it will make us more effective in our production efforts."

GRW_excavation_of_march:0 "Develop the Marsh"
GRW_excavation_of_mach_desc:0 "The terrible marsh is, as the name implies, quite terrible.

prywhen.3.d:0 "The Kingdom of Brodfeld is losing ground to the Griffon Liberation Army at an alarming rate. We have received a communique from Brodfeld officialy requesting our help in their war effort. While supporting Brodfeld is not necessarily in our best interest, stopping the spread of communism certainly is."
prywhen.3.a:0 "Time to put the Reds in their place!"
prywhen.3.b:0 "Why should we care about their problems?"
## RESPONSE EVENT FOR BRODFELD iF DENIED ###
prywhen.4.t:0 "The Bandits refuse to help"

prywhen.4.a:0 "What will we do now?!"
prywhen.4.b:0 "No"
#### EVENT FOR BANDTIS
prywhen.5.t:0 "Brodfeld Lost the War"
prywhen.5.d:0 "The Griffon Liberation Army has triumphed over the Loyalists. This may be the ideal moment to strike the GLA, while they are still recovering from the war. Should we launch an attack on the communists?"
prywhen.5.a:0 "Destroy the equalitarian rabble!"
prywhen.5.b:0 "We are not ready."

prywhen.7.t:0 "Militia"
prywhen.7.d:0 "Due to a recent surge in recruitment, new militia regiments have been formed and are ready to fight as of this moment."
prywhen.7.a:0 "Great!"

prywhen.8.t:0 "Partisans!"
prywhen.8.d:0 "We can call a group of partisans for an uprising in the enemy territory, and secretly send a number of our weapons to them. The question is, which region of Brodfeld would be best for this operation?"
prywhen.8.a:0 "The Ricefields!"
prywhen.8.b:0 "The Capital, Kivessin!"
prywhen.8.c:0 "The most important port, Sydia!"

prywhen.9.t:0 "The Civil War is Over"
prywhen.9.d:0 "After years of war, we have finally managed to liberate all of Prywhen from the monarchists. There is much to be done now, as the war has left our nation devastated and our people starving. We must begin efforts to rebuild the country in order to secure a prosperous future for our people."
prywhen.9.a:0 "Time to rebuild."

prywhen.10.t:0 "Civil War Effect Fades Off"

prywhen.13.t:0 "Civil War Effect Fades Off"
prywhen.13.d:0 "Our nation is finally starting to recover from the civil war that tore the country asunder."
prywhen.13.a:0 "Great"

prywhen.14.t:0 "Civil War Recovery Complete"
prywhen.14.d:0 "We have finally managed to fully rebuild Prywhen and recover from the effects of the civil war."
prywhen.14.a:0 "At last!"

prywhen.16.t:0 "Search for the Prince!"
prywhen.16.d:0 "We must not allow Prywhen to return to the oppression of a king ever again. To this end, we must hunt down and capture the heir to the throne of Brodfeld as soon as possible."
prywhen.16.a:0 "The Hunt is on."

prywhen.17.t:0 "The Prince has Escaped!"
prywhen.17.d:0 "After eluding our capture for weeks, we had finally managed to corner the Prince while attempting to leave the country. Unfortunately, his loyalist guards managed to delay the arrest, and his current whereabouts are unknown. It can be safely assumed, however, that he has left the country and has found shelter in the court of some other tyrannical regime. The Prince has eluded our grasp."
prywhen.17.a:0 "Damn that blue-blooded swine!"

prywhen.18.t:0 "The Prince was Killed!"
prywhen.18.d:0 "Our police finally managed to track down the prince in hideout near Twelt. Our special forces stormed the cave, and in the ensueing firefight, the Prince and all his loyalists were killed."
prywhen.18.a:0 "So the bastard's dead? A shame we didn't capture him alive."

prywhen.19.t:0 "The Prince was captured!"
prywhen.19.d:0 "After citizens reported seeing a griffon matching the Prince's description in the port of Sydia, our police managed to stop him from boarding a ship bound for Equestria in the last minute. The Prince was arrested and imprisoned immediatly. What shall we do with him?"
prywhen.19.a:0 "Hang him publicly in [GRW.Capital.GetName]!"
prywhen.19.b:0 "Just execute him. No need for a show."
prywhen.19.c:0 "Let him rot in jail."

prywhen.20.t:0 "Find the King!"
prywhen.20.d:0 "The crimes committed by the rulers of Brodfeld are unforgivable. It is of the utmost importance that the former King Kloseu be captured and put on trial for his crimes. We must not allow the tyrant to escape justice, and hence we shall immediatly instruct all echelons of power in Prywhen to find and arrest him. "
prywhen.20.a:0 "We will find him."

prywhen.21.t:0 "The King has Escaped!"
prywhen.21.d:0 "After weeks of fruitless search, we believed that we had finally cornered King Kloseu in the home of a family sympathetic to the royalist cause. It was soon revealed however, that the individual our police was tracking was not, in fact, the King, but a double with striking similarities to Kloseu. Under torture, the double revealed that his sole purpose was to throw us of the King's trail, and that he was, in all likelihood, already far from [GRW.GetAdjective] territory. The King has eluded our grasp, most likely for good."
prywhen.21.a:0 "Damned Fools! This is a disaster!"

prywhen.22.t:0 "The Tyrant was Killed!"
prywhen.22.d:0 "After an intricate search of the royal palace, it was revealed that the King was still hiding in his secret chambers in the castle walls. Although he did not resist arrest, our soldiers soldiers could not contain their anger and beat the King to the brink of death. Sadly, he died hours later in the Kivessin Central Hospital."
prywhen.22.a:0 "Good riddance anyway."

prywhen.23.t:0 "The Tyrant was Captured!"
prywhen.23.d:0 "After weeks of hunting, our police forces finally caught a break in their search for King Kloseu. Appearently he was planning to flee the Continent and was all ready to leave via Airplane, but because of poor weather his departure was delayed for a day. Police caught wind of his plans, and raided his hideout in Twelt. Though most of his guards were killed, the King himself surrendered without a struggle. He is now safely locked away and awaiting his fate."
prywhen.23.a:0 "Death is the only option for him!"
prywhen.23.b:0 "Imprison him for now."

prywhen.24.t:0 "Find the Monarchist Supporters!"
prywhen.24.d:0 "We may have been victorious in the civil war, but monarchists and counter-revolutionaries still exist in Prywhen. If we wish to secure all that we have accomplished here, these reactionary elements must be dealt with. How big shall our effort to find these traitors be? "
prywhen.24.a:0 "Find them at any cost!"
prywhen.24.b:0 "A moderate effort should be enough."
prywhen.24.c:0 "We cannot spare much for this."
prywhen.24.e:0 "They are not important."
prywhen.24.f:0 "Counter-revolutionaries? What nonsense."

prywhen.25.t:0 "The Revolution is Safe!"
prywhen.25.d:0 "After weeks of searching, we believe we have finally captured and imprisoned all reactionary elements within the nation. They will now be put to trial, and the worst of them shall never see the light of day again. At this point, it seems highly unlikely that counter-revolutionary forces will ever be able to organize a milita in Prywhen again."
prywhen.25.a:0 "Great News!"

prywhen.26.t:0 "Royalists in the Country!"
prywhen.26.d:0 "Though the efforts of our police and military have been very great, we have not managed to capture all of the royalist filth that still remains in Prywhen. This will certainly cause problems for us in the future."
prywhen.26.a:0 "Damn those traitors!"

prywhen.27.t:0 "Counter Revolution!"
prywhen.27.d:0 "Our efforts to quell reactionary and counter-revolutionary activities have been too low, it seems. Many royalists and fascists are beginning to form militias again, fighting a guerilla war against our state. We must rally our forces to deal with this. "
prywhen.27.a:0 "This is a disaster!"

prywhen.31.t:0 "Industrialization Progress!"
prywhen.31.d:0 "Our recent efforts to improve the industrial capabilities of Prywhen have born fruit, and our economy and industry have improved by a large amount. This will surely benefit the nation in the future."
prywhen.31.a:0 "We reap that which we sowed."

prywhen.32.t:0 "Our Industry is Growing!"
prywhen.32.d:0 "Our economy has improved a lot in the last years, and we are now almost at the industrial and economical level as the western griffonian states. Through careful investments into our industrial sector, we should be able to improve our economy even further."
prywhen.32.a:0 "The Revolution will prevail!"

prywhen.33.t:0 "The Counter-Revolution has Failed!"
prywhen.33.d:0 "After months of fighting, arrests and imprisonments, it seems we have finally managed to stop the counter-revolution in it's tracks. This will allow us to improve the ideological foundation of Prywhen and finally initiate a return to normality."
prywhen.33.a:0 "About Time!"

prywhen.35.t:0 "Our Industry is Growing!"
prywhen.35.d:0 "After years of industrial and economical development and expansion, our industrial potential has finally reached the levels of the major western griffon states! This clearly shows that communist economics are the most efficient ever to be devised."
prywhen.35.a:0 "Revolution will prevail!"

prywhen.36.t:0 "Possible Support From the [LUS.GetName]"
prywhen.36.d:0 "Currently there are several communist groups in Lushi. We shall send our envoy and beg for their support in our final push in this civil war."
prywhen.36.a:0 "Yes."

prywhen.37.t:0 "Possible Support From Gryphus"
prywhen.37.d:0 "There are several partisan rebel groups hiding out in the forests of the northern part of Gryphus. We must send an envoy and ask them to join us in the final push in our own civil war. It is a much better option than fighting in the forests endlessly with victory nowhere in sight."
prywhen.37.a:0 "Great."

prywhen.38.t:0 "Possible Support From the Gryphian Host"
prywhen.38.d:0 "There are many groups of griffons who are dead tired of the despotic government of the Gryphian Host and their endless and useless attacks on the River Federation. They will surely join us in our fight for freedom if we promise to liberate their nation next."
prywhen.38.a:0 "Yes."

prywhen.39.t:0 "Support For the Griffon Liberation Army"
prywhen.39.d:0 "We may provide support for [GRW.GetNameDef] in their struggle for freedom, shall we? While this will obviously cost us manpower that could be used elsewhere, the experience gained by our volunteers could prove to be invaluable."
prywhen.39.a:0 "Yes."
prywhen.39.b:0 "No."

prywhen.40.t:0 "Volunteers Arrived!"
prywhen.40.d:0 "[From.GetNameDef] has arranged for more volunteer brigades to help us in our struggle to spread the revolution."
prywhen.40.a:0 "Fantastic!"

prywhen.41.t:0 "Claims on Saltmarkt!"
prywhen.41.d:0 "Salmarkt is a rightful part of our nation, and if we have to use force to get it back, then so be it."
prywhen.41.a:0 "It will be ours once more!"

prywhen.42.t:0 "Famine Erupts!"
prywhen.42.d:0 "With the civil war dragging on and on, the devastation has caused our agriculture to collapse. We are running out of stored supplies, and hunger slowly envelopes the countryside."
prywhen.42.a:0 "Damnation!"

prywhen.43.t:0 "Ravaging Hunger"
prywhen.43.d:0 "The ongoing famine continues to ravage the countryside. Many are dying, and there are reports of griffons resorting to cannibalism in order to stay alive. It is not expected that the situation will improve anytime soon."
prywhen.43.a:0 "This is a disaster!"

prywhen.44.t:0 "Open up the Lord's Cellars!"
prywhen.44.d:0 "The former King of Brodfeld has a huge private larder. Opening it up and distributing it to the public will reduce the effects of the ongoing famine for some time. However we will need to reform our agriculture to be able to fully get rid of the famine."
prywhen.44.a:0 "The Swine, hoarding food during a famine..."

prywhen.45.t:0 "The Famine is Over!"
prywhen.45.d:0 "With our agruculture finally modernized, we are now able to centralize our food production and distribute it equally among the citizens. This will finally end this famine, but its effects will likely be felt for decades still."
prywhen.45.a:0 "Good but...bad..."

brodfeld.13.d:0 "There are rumors that the Trade Federation purchased several armoured mechanical beasts from ponyland over the ocean. Those machines spit fire and can drive on their own. Their government recently constructed a military factory and started manufacturing the magical creations in secret, away from the public eye. Luckily, one of the trade federation officials spilled the beans to our prince's mother-in-law, who is a daughter of burgmister of Fezera and was visiting Skyfall. We should embark a party for the journey and sail west to aquire on of the few models. This might as well be the key to our victory in the civil war. The speed of the operation and reliance of the pirate ship crew that we managed to hire, as they were the only onces to sail these waters, will depend on the amount of pay."

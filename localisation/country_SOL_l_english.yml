 equestria.151.a:0 "Reforms of civilian administration will suffice."
 equestria.151.b:0 "Military will join civilians for the time of war."

 equestria.153.d_nobles:0 "Your Majesty, we couldn't help but notice that you, please pardon the term, seem different that before. The policies you have enacted, while of course necessary, have been considered extreme by some. Perhaps Your Majesty could reconsider some of the details?"

Still, I had to at least pay some attention, if they were going to be successful.\n\nThe station itself was bustling with activity, though I, Sunrise Sparkle, ignored all of that. Instead, I looked for my quarry- an Crystal Guard. Mindful of the shocked and confused stares, and the guard's nervous gaze. He no doubt had spotted a few things. Firstly that I was Twilight Sparkle. Or was, rather, but he didn't need to know that. Secondly that I was in the company of a batpony and a couple other well-ragged ponies, clearly refugees. Thirdly, the well-battered and practically ancient .32 calibre revolver jammed in an equally ancient holster on my right hip.\n\nDeterminedly, I ignored the gazes and his wariness, and trotted up to the guard, using my magic to remove and levitate the pistol and belt away from my barrel- and careful not to knock loose my Kolibri hidden away within the rags.

You'll have to pardon my concern, seeing as the guard who received you reported that you handed him a gun- I didn't even know you owned a gun, let alone had one. It's a relief to see you safe, though. Was your journey safe?"\n\n"It was... safe enough - as safe as something like that can get, in any case."\n\n"That is good to hear, at least. Come, Twilight, why don't I show you and your friends to your rooms?""

That bit, at least, was true. Re-education would take a few moons, after all. I paused, taking a sip of my tea. "Luna has been... deposed of, to put things mildly."\n\nTo put them more firmly: she was gone. Permanently, this time.\n\nWhilst Cadence was stirring her own tea, trying to gather her thoughts, I chanced a gaze up to the wall clock- it'd been a couple hours. Hopefully, Scorecard hadn't run into any troubles."

solarempiresparkles.6.d:0 "I heard the pounding on my door as I roused myself from my sleep and immediately realised what'd happened. That idiot bat pony had gotten himself caught and that meant I was burnt. Thinking quickly, I took my Kolibri pistol, and gazing about myself, grit my teeth as I lit up my horn. Risky, but necessary, I swallowed the minuscule weapon, feeling somewhat sickly as I choked it down my throat. Then, I cast a long ago learnt medical spell to stave off the effects of the onset lead poisoning for a full forty-eight hours. Long enough for me to exhume the weapon- preferably by mouth- later. I then put on my sleepiest face, and stumbled over to the door, opening it.\n\nAs I suspected, I was slammed quickly to the ground and placed in hoofcuffs, a horn bracket clamped at my horn's base to prevent magic.\n\n"Twilight Sparkle, you are under arrest for conspiracy of treason against the Crystal throne. If you resist, you shall be terminated with extreme prejudice."\n\n"Well sod you too, whatever your name is. Bloody wonderful thing to wake up to."\n\nA few hours of processing later, and I was in the dungeons, far below the castle itself. Ironic, in my opinion. Cadence and Shining had, of course, come down and given me the usual spiels, and I'd played the unrepentant zealot- which, to be fair, I probably am- and so I was left to my own devices. Waiting a few minutes to make sure I was fully alone, I moved to a dark corner of the room. I didn't have magic, but I still had a Kolibri, after all. It was all just about finding the proper time to break out, now."
solarempiresparkles.6.a:0 "It was worth a try..."

solarempiresparkles.15.t:0 "Execute"
solarempiresparkles.15.d_susp:0 "There was a slight knock on the door, as Scorecard let himself in, closing and locking it behind him. He looked frustrated, as I gazed questioningly at the batpony from over my reading glasses. "Well?"\n\n"I was caught." He whispered softly, holding up a hoof to placate me. "I explained it away at being lost, but they're no doubt more suspicious. Nonetheless I did manage to get what I was looking for, so we have that going for us."\n\nI'd have said I expected better, but truthfully, I'd expected worse out of the barely a pony. "Very well. We'll go forward, cautiously. Give me a few hours to prepare; I'll find you." With a soundless nod, he turned about and left, locking the door back behind him. Just in case."
solarempiresparkles.15.d:0 "I looked up from the book I'd been reading, as somepony knocked gently on the door. "It's open." I greeted neutrally, unsure of who was at the door. As the familiar face of Scorecard entered the room, shutting it behind him with a smile, I shut the book, and gave the stallion my full attention. "Well?"\n\n"Everything is ready. Should be smooth sailing from here on out, Sparkle." He stated softly as he walked over, careful not to give anything that he did not have to away, in case we were being spied upon.\n\n"Good to hear. I'll come find you when I'm ready, then. Good evening, Scorecard."\n\n"And you as well, Sparkle." And with a nod, he was gone, as I settled back into my reading. I'd give it a few hours, then go forward with the operation. Tonight was to be a night of swiftness and precision, and I needed time to prepare myself, mentally. Soon."

solarempiresparkles.150.t:0 "Almost there"
solarempiresparkles.150.d:0 "Scorecard placed a hoof against the wall of the hallway we were in. Tapping soundlessly against it to a rhythm he only knew- the rhythm of a guard's hoofsteps. A long, tense, second, then he gave me a fanged grin and nodded. I couldn't help but smirk back. Pathetic excuse for a pony he may have been, but he was damn good at his work. I'd have to request Daybreaker for further use of his services, once this was all over.\n\nThe four of us slunk into the next hall, and halted outside a particular room I'd known quite well. Princess Flurry Heart's bedroom. Hopefully, the filly would be sleeping quietly, and not raise quite a ruckus. I softly pushed the door open, and, as my eyes adjusted to the darkness, my breath died in my throat.\n\nFlash Sentry, a massive handcannon of some sort in on his hip, exhaled gently, moving his hoof away from the holster. "Jeez, Pr-Twilight. Scared me half to death."\n\nThis moronic idiot was guarding my Niece? Now I was doubly glad I was stealing her away. "Ah, apologies...Corporal?"\n\n"Er. Major, actually. Got a battlefield commission!"\n\n"Major? You are moving up in the world, Flash." I started to doubt the sanity of my brother - putting Flash Sentry in any position of responsibility?\n\n"Mind if I step in for a minute? I wanted to see Flurry Heart again..."\n\n"Oh, of course, your hi- ma'am. No reason you can't. You are her aunt after all. Just keep it down, she is sleeping."\n\nI flicked my gaze momentarily back to Scorecard, who nodded and fell back from the door, to explain to the twins, as I myself stepped inside, closing the door gently behind me. Almost mechanically, I lit a small light spell with my horn, cantering gently over. "It's been so long since I've seen her, it feels.""

solarempiresparkles.17.d:0 ""I mean, you were here just a few weeks ago, remember?" Flash then paused, as if he'd started to say something, then thought of something else.\n\nMy heart fell to the pit of my stomach in dread, as I heard the tell-tale sound of Flash's handcannon's hammer being cocked. "Twilight Sparkle's magic is magenta." He stated simply.\n\nI clicked my tongue, and turned about, slowly, so as not to provoke the stallion, maintaining my magical aura to avoid his suspicion. I didn't want to resort to my Kolibri- yet.\n\nInstead I used my magic to wrest the gun from his grip, as it discharged harmlessly into the ceiling. Flash closed the distance, slamming me into the ground, as the door to the room itself burst open. Jabbing a wing at my chest to expunge the breath from my lungs, his other tugged at a shrill- whistle, quickly brought to his mouth, as it sung out an alarm. A quick whip from Scorecard's Welrod, directly to Flash's head, knocked the stallion out, but the damage had already been done."

solarempiresparkles.18.t_fail:0 "Caught"
solarempiresparkles.18.d_fail:0 "I spun about, gazing at the door in shock, as pistol fire barked, splattering Scorecard's blood all over Axle Grease. The twins spun about, their own weapons- knives- at the ready, and were similarly cut down by what could only be the Crystal Guard. I quickly tossed my Kolibri out the open window above Flurry's bed, before letting my magic fall silent, holding my hooves up in surrender as Crystal Guards filled the room.\n\n"Twilight Sparkle of the Solar Empire, you are under arrest for plotting and attempted treason against the Crystal Crown, Espionage between two sovereign nations, and assuming Major Sentry does not survive, Murder. Do not resist."\n\nLike I had much of a choice."
solarempiresparkles.18.b:0 "I was so close..."

solarempiresparkles.18.t:0 "Slip away"
solarempiresparkles.18.d:0 "Thinking quickly, I stood to my hooves, and motioned for the other three to come close. Wasting no time, I let out a flash teleport, as the room burst open, my breath momentarily catching in my throat as I came face to face with a very angry Shining Armor.\n\nWe found ourselves out in the snow, as I allowed my fury to swell, lending heat to myself and the others. I wished for nothing more than to bring the holy ruination of my Empress' ruination down upon the Crystal Ponies. However, I had to remain calm and collected. The Crystal Guard would no doubt be looking for us, as Cadence's insistence, so time was of the essence. Quickly, I formed a spell Matrix, centred on Canterlot, and lit up my horn. At least we would escape to tell the tale."

solarempiresparkles.16.t:0 "Success"
solarempiresparkles.16.d:0 ""I mean, you were here just a few weeks ago, remember?" Flash then paused, as if he'd started to say something, then thought of something else.\n\n"Twilight, why is your magical aura yellow?"\n\nMy heart skipped a beat, and my brain froze, as I turned to face the stallion, who was more confused than concerned. I no doubt had a troubled smile on my face.\n\n"Oh, well, you see-" a quick flick of my horn, and the minuscule Kolibri- smallest developed pistol in the world, apparently, chirped four times, it's normally incredibly inaccurate 2.7mm rounds travelling the short journey from the barrel to Sentry's barrel, as he flopped back, down and out for the count. Scorecard and the twins burst in immediately, carrying their own holdout weapons, consisting of a stiletto, another Kolibri, and a Solar Imperial made Welrod. I chanced a look over to Flurry; still sleeping soundly, and levitated her over in my magic, dropping the Kolibri- it's job was over. After awaiting a tense moment to make sure I wasn't interrupted, the four of us bunched up, my magic bringing Flurry close to my barrel, and I began to cast my oft-used spell.\n\nA few matrices and we were safely home across the border, Hollow Shades' quiet farmhouses greeting us. My niece snored gently, bringing a wide smile to my face. "Gentlecolts: well bloody done.""

To call her stubborn would be an insult to the Obstinate and mule-headed everywhere. For the past two days, we'd gone nowhere, arguing back and forth and back and forth about the Empire's eventual accession back into the Solar Empire. And, by extension, Cadence's flat refusal to do so.\n\nFlapping my wings in frustration, I made my way to the Royal Garden- a poor mockery of the Canterlot Garden, though that was to be expected from a poor mockery of a proper Empire. Still, I could use the change in pace to gather my thoughts.

solarempiresparkles.33.d:0 "I smiled, softly. It was nice to see Shiny again, after what felt like a lifetime of political turmoil, at home and abroad. Deciding to relax for a few, I jogged over to the Stallion and my teenaged niece, as they went over the growing filly's fencing lessons, sparring back and forth across the grass. "Hey, you two."\n\n"Hey, Twily!" Came Shining's reply, as Flurry beamed- she'd always enjoyed seeing me.\n\nThe growing mare then bounded over to me, much like she had when she was a young filly- still not used to her larger than average wingspan, it seemed. "Hi auntie! Howzit in Equestria?"\n\nEquestria? Had.. had Cadence been keeping the two in the dark? Shining made no moves to correct her...\n\n"Oh, busy, you know how it is."\n\n"I can imagine," Shining nodded, before continuing. "What with you being D-Princess Celestia's new Science minister and all that. What brings you here?"\n\nThey had. They had really been keeping my little Flurry-burry in the dark. "Oh, you know. Bureaucracy. I'm overseeing the opening of a new academy here, perhaps Cadence mentioned it?"\n\n"Oh, yes, the Crystal Academy, right? It's about time that opened."\n\n"Quite so." A thought crossed my mind. "In fact, why don't the three of us go tour it before all the students swamp in, eh?"\n\n"Why, that sounds like a splendid idea! Flurry, why don't you go put away your fencing equipment, and we'll make a family outing out of it."\n\n"That sounds excellent. Here, Flurry, I can teleport us to your room, that should make it quick."\n\n"Sure, Auntie!" With her approval, I did so, as we arrived inside her palatial room. She went to put away her gear, and I went about drawing a spell matrix. She returned, somewhat confused as I hit her with a strong sleep spell, before she was able to say anything. I exhaled. That was easier than I'd hoped. Turning to the door, I locked it, and levitated Flurry's somewhat weighty body over to my own. She'd forgive me eventually. The task done, I planted myself within the spell matrix, and lit up my horn. Next stop? [SOL.Capital.GetName]."

solarempiresparkles.34.t:0 "Grand Entrance"
solarempiresparkles.34.d:0 "I stepped proudly off the Solar Imperial express train, flanked by veteran inquisitors to my left and right. I myself stood squarely in the centre of the formation, the robes and finery of my station as Grand Solar Inquisitor catching in the winter breeze, as I swept my gaze across the gathered guards. I smiled, widely, a territorial and unfriendly smile. "Greetings, my good mares and stallions. We've an appointment with Her Highness, Mi Amore Cadenza. You will take us to her, post-haste."\n\nWithin minutes, we were being lead through the doors of the castle itself, a cadre of Crystal Guards surrounding us, carrying very real and very loaded rifles, at parade rest. Not even worth the effort to dispatch them, really, if it came to blows. It'd take... perhaps fifteen seconds; eight if I actually cared enough to focus on them.\n\nCadenza seemed shocked, as I made my way towards her throne, until I was ordered to stop by the guards. \n\n"I come bearing a message from Our Empress, Daybreaker: She Who Raises The Sun, Sol Invicta, the Dawn Hammer, True Goddess of this mortal world, may she reign eternally." I bowed, formally, as I presented my ruler's titles to Cadenza. After the requisite time passed, I returned to my standing position, and my Solar-touched gaze met that of Mi Amore Cadenza's - for the first time since I'd arrived, as I relished in her fear and uncertainty. "Her message is as follows: you shall return you and your ponies to our Solar Fold," I paused, to ensure I had her full attention, and that she fully understood my ultimatum."

Unholy fires blazed behind her eyes, as she proclaimed her Empress' rule, and I bit my tongue momentarily as she awaited my response. Steeling myself, I obliged the Solar Witch."
solarempiresparkles.35.a:0 "We have no choice but to agree - lest they make true on their threats."

solarempiresparkles.36.d:0 "Cadence steeled herself, a fire within her eyes rivalling my own. "No."\n\n"No?" I echoed, giving her a chance to renege on her poor wording.\n\n"No," she doubled down, "We shall stand firm against any and all tyranny, including that of your ruler. Be gone, harlot, and do not return."\n\nI wanted nothing more than to smite the insolent whelp where she stood. It would be a boringly easy task. A simple flick of the horn, and she would be naught but ash upon holy fire burnt ground.\n\nBut, Daybreaker's orders had been clear. My mane smouldered, as the odour of Sulphur bloomed in the air, and I grit my teeth. "Very well, you miserable excuse for an alicorn. Your chance was given. Now the blood of your peoples falls upon your hooves." And with my words spoken, I turned upon my hooves, surrounded by my loyal inquisitors and the Crystal Guard, and headed back towards the train. War would come, and war would come soon. And then Cadence would know the true ruination of Daybreaker's Holy Sun."

We shall recognise Daybreaker's regime as our continuing overlords, beginning immediately, and shall fall back into the Equestrian Fold."\n\nI smiled, widely, baring my grinning teeth. Cadence was no fool, after all. "So glad of you to see reason, sister of mine. Now, effective immediately...""

It appears that while many ponies have seen the light and the reason within the Empress, some others have decided to cling onto their old ways of 'Harmony', and they now seek to bring down our new Order from within. Needless to say, this is quite the problem indeed, and we would best be of to crush this movement before it can get any more popularity among the populace."

As such we should welcome those batponies who wish to follow us with a loving embrace of mother, afterall they too are our little ponies. We will integrate batponies into our society, under guiding hoof of the imperial inquisition. Our dear student should be up to the task, we are sure she will be able to come up with "oh-so-detailed" plans for integration of batponies. Perhaps if we let them join military. Their talents would be of great benefit to us and we might even discover new skilled officers among them.

 solarempire.41.d:0 "It is hard to keep track of all the thestral tribes scattered around the Empire. Our land is vast and it is not effective to look for each individual tribe in far reaches of jungles or some misbegotten mountains. We should organize resettlement of thestrals and move them somewhere where we can easily keep track of them. Isles near our coast seem like a good pick for such a task. Some of them are large enough to sustain sizable thestral population. We should "encourage" resettlement and help them build new cities. We are in no way giving up on our citizens, it will simply be much easier to watch over them. We will have our inquisitors work in these new cities and educate thestrals. These new cities might even develop into new industrial centers in time. Naturally, at first there might be some dissent against this idea but eventually they will come to see it is for the best.

There is only one possible solution to this situation. We must purify them by only mean possible - in the holy flames. Our imperial inquisition will be more than capable to achieve this. They will round up all the thestrals and do what must be done. It may not seem right at the moment, but they will inevitably pose a threat to stability of our Empire in future. We will not stop until every single bat has been hunted down and defeated. We must steal away our hearts and do what must be done for preservation of stability within our Empire. Stability of the Empire must be preserved at all cost and if few batpony lives are the cost of it, then it is a price we are willing to pay.

 solarempire.30.d_pro:0 "Earlier today the last of the known anti-imperial terrorist leaders were arrested following the defection of one of their last remaining operatives. In recent weeks the ranks of those terrorist cells opposing the Empress’ leadership have steadily fallen in number, with the most commonly cited reason for giving up the fight by former rebels being increasing satisfaction with the reign of Empress Daybreaker. These last terrorist cell leaders were to be tried in a court of law, but even before the courts have been called to order the Empress has announced that she will be commuting the sentences of those convicted in order to promote national healing."

Trials were swiftly convened for those captured, trying them as enemies of the state, saboteurs, traitors, and jaywalkers. Sentencing was just as swiftly handed down with two-thirds of those captured being summarily executed, one-third being sentenced to hard labor, and just a few being sentenced to exile in the wilderness areas of Equestria. The Empress called the rapid legal process ‘true justice’ and declared to all Equestrians a new holiday to celebrate the purging of the rebel leadership."
 solarempire.30.d_god:0 "Following the exterminatus of the last town to openly declare its opposition to the Golden Throne of Canterlot, the newly formed Her Imperial Majesty's Holy Inquisition rounded up the last of the heretic strongholds. With pure hearts of hatred many were cut down by the military, while other fleeing traitors had the loyal inhabitants of nearby towns fall upon them to burn them at the stake, but the most brutal of fates were reserved for those who survived to be captured. Most did not survive interrogations before ever getting to trial, and those who made it to those golden halls soon found that their fates had already been sealed and the trials were only a formality to show the world the depths of their sins. One stallion repented on the stand, and was recognized by the Empress herself as being redeemed and granted her mercy. His death was swift and painless, his soul freed from sin and corruption."

With the war now officially over those self-proclaimed ‘Harmonic Resistance’ supporters have come together into large cells to oppose the government with whatever means they have at their disposal. Some are participating in work slowdowns, others are publishing anti-Daybreaker pamphlets, and others still have attacked government facilities with armed force. With members of these groups numbering in the thousands, one thing is clear, despite attempts by Empress Daybreaker to unify the nation under her rule the old interpretation of Harmony is not going anywhere for a while."

I am to make the Crystal Empire bend it's knee to it’s true, Solar Rulers- by whatever means necessary...\n\nMy only hope is that Shining and Cadence are reasonable in the face of the new regime; that they can be brought to see Daybreaker’s light as I have. But, if they cannot... well...\n\nThat's why I am going, after all. I slid open my closet door with a quick and simple spell, and gazed at the three sets of clothing in the direct center. Daybreaker had given me the mission, and I'd given myself three options. Making my choice, I levitated my selection out of the closet to dress in. I'd go as..."

 solarempiresparkles.2.t:0 "Arrival"
 solarempiresparkles.2.d:0 "I gazed about the train car as it ground to a halt, Griffon-made Kolibri pistol hidden and tucked securely within my rags. For a brief moment, my eyes met a batpony across from me- one of the very few that had seen my Empress’ light. The barely a pony looked away from my superiority after a brief moment, though his gaze did betray his worry. Scorecard, I’d been told his name was. Not that I cared, much. Still, I had to at least pay some attention, if they were going to be successful.\n\nThe station itself was bustling with activity, though I, Sunrise Sparkle, ignored all of that. Instead, I looked for my quarry- an Crystal Guard. Mindful of the shocked and confused stares, and the guard’s nervous gaze. He no doubt had spotted a few things. Firstly that I was Twilight Sparkle. Or was, rather, but he didn't need to know that. Secondly that I was in the company of a batpony and a couple other well-ragged ponies, clearly refugees. Thirdly, the well-battered and practically ancient .32 caliber revolver jammed in an equally ancient holster on my right hip.\n\nDeterminedly, I ignored the gazes and his wariness, and trotted up to the guard, using my magic to remove and levitate the pistol and belt away from my barrel- and careful not to knock loose my Kolibri hidden away within the rags. "I am here to seek asylum from the Illegitimate Solar Imperial Rule. Please, Sir, I need to see my brother and sister-in-law.""

No further news about the pony herself has left the Empire, though rumor-mongers have speculated several reasons for the Princess’s self-imposed exile."
 solarempiresparkles.3.a:0 "It's good to have her as our guest."

I'll take you directly to the Princess at once. Please follow me."\n\nWith an inward sigh of relief, I nodded gently, and trotted along behind the guard. Step one was done; now it was time for step two."
 solarempiresparkles.4.d_susp:0 "He didn't seem to be buying it, by the squint of his eyes. I did my best not to let my nerves get the best of me, as my motley band of commandos did the same, behind me. It felt like an eternity as he judged me with his gaze, before giving a short nod. "Very well, follow me. I'll have to report this to my commanding officer, ma’am- you understand I'm sure- but otherwise I'll send you on your way."\n\nI exhaled a breath I didn't know I'd been holding. "Of course, sir. Can't be too careful, after all.""
 solarempiresparkles.4.a:0 "Let's carry on."

 solarempiresparkles.41.t:0 "Sister-in-law"
 solarempiresparkles.41.d:0 "The rather dull guardspony rushed us to the throne room, as I put on the best Twilight Sparkle impression that I could, and Scorecard’s group put on the best wayward Rebel impressions they could manage.\n\nUpon the guard’s introduction of us, Cadence immediately leapt down from her pedestal, and pulled me into an impressively firm hug. "Oh my goodness, Twilight! I'm so glad that you're safe! Were you followed? Did they hunt you? Are you okay?"\n\nI wheezed slightly, as Cadence attempted to murder me by hugging, which she took for being a tad sickly, as she pressed a hoof to my forehead. "Cadence, I’m okayyyy, promise. Just a bit ragged, is all. We got out okay. I have no idea if we were followed." That seemed to ease her concern at least, as she led us to our rooms, to get cleaned up and food in our bellies."
 solarempiresparkles.41.d_susp:0 "The meeting took far too long to arrange, for my liking. Far, far too long for an asylum request. I would have to instruct Scorecard and his lackeys to be doubly careful with his preparations. Finally, I was nallowed to enter the throne room, where my Sister-in-law was awaiting me. The tone was... cool, to say the least, but I could work with cool, if I had to.\n\nI gave Cadenza a respectful bow, from my position in front of her throne, as Scorecard and the twins did the same behind me. "Cadence, it's good to see you." I began, choosing my words carefully- she was already suspicious of me; being overly cold or overly honeyed with my words could blow my cover just as easily as being caught out as a spy. "I was starting to worry you wouldn't see me at all."\n\n"Yes, well... can't be too careful, after all. You'll have to pardon my concern, seeing as the guard who received you reported that you handed him a gun- I didn't even know you owned a gun, let alone had one. It's a relief to see you safe, though. Was your journey safe?"\n\n"It was... safe enough - as safe as something like that can get, in any case."\n\n"That is good to hear, at least. Come, Twilight, why don't I show you and your friends to your rooms?""
 solarempiresparkles.41.a:0 "We will see what Cadence thinks."

 solarempiresparkles.5.t:0 "Plan B"
 solarempiresparkles.5.d:0 ""I've got to know, Twilight, how bad is it over there?" Cadence questioned, over a warm cup of Jasmine tea, as we sat together in a parlor, a warm fireplace crackling happily nearby.\n\n"Bad." I replied, keeping my tone sad. A few lies here and there, hidden amongst the truth would be the way forward, I felt. "Purges, ponies being sent to camps. I haven't seen or heard from the girls in a week." That bit, at least, was true. Re-education would take a few months, after all. I paused, taking a sip of my tea. "Luna has been... deposed of, to put things mildly."\n\nTo put them more firmly: she was gone. Permanently, this time.\n\nWhilst Cadence was stirring her own tea, trying to gather her thoughts, I chanced a gaze up to the wall clock- it'd been a couple hours. Hopefully, Scorecard hadn't run into any troubles."

 solarempiresparkles.6.d:0 "I heard the pounding on my door as I roused myself from my sleep and immediately realized what'd happened. That idiot bat pony had gotten himself caught and that meant I was burnt. Thinking quickly, I took my Kolibri pistol, and gazing about myself, grit my teeth as I lit up my horn. Risky, but necessary, I swallowed the miniscule weapon, feeling somewhat sickly as I choked it down my throat. Then, I cast a long ago learnt medical spell to stave off the effects of the onset lead poisoning for a full forty-eight hours. Long enough for me to exhume the weapon- preferably by mouth- later. I then put on my sleepiest face, and stumbled over to the door, opening it.\n\nAs I suspected, I was slammed quickly to the ground and placed in hoofcuffs, a horn bracket clamped at my horn’s base to prevent magic.\n\n"Twilight Sparkle, you are under arrest for conspiracy of treason against the Crystal throne. If you resist, you shall be terminated with extreme prejudice."\n\n"Well sod you too, whatever your name is. Bloody wonderful thing to wake up to."\n\nA few hours of processing later, and I was in the dungeons, far below the castle itself. Ironic, in my opinion. Cadence and Shining had, of course, come down and given me the usual spiels, and I'd played the unrepentant zealot- which, to be fair, I probably am- and so I was left to my own devices. Waiting a few minutes to make sure I was fully alone, I moved to a dark corner of the room. I didn't have magic, but I still had a Kolibri, after all. It was all just about finding the proper time to break out, now."
 solarempiresparkles.6.a:0 "It was worth a try..."

He looked frustrated, as I gazed questioningly at the batpony from over my reading glasses. "Well?"\n\n"I was caught." He whispered softly, holding up a hoof to placate me. "I explained it away at being lost, but they're no doubt more suspicious. Nonetheless I did manage to get what I was looking for, so we have that going for us."\n\nI'd have said I expected better, but truthfully, I'd expected worse out of the barely a pony. "Very well. We’ll go forward, cautiously. Give me a few hours to prepare; I'll find you." With a soundless nod, he turned about and left, locking the door back behind him. Just in case."
 solarempiresparkles.15.d:0 "I looked up from the book I’d been reading, as somepony knocked gently on the door. "It's open." I greeted neutrally, unsure of who was at the door. As the familiar face of Scorecard entered the room, shutting it behind him with a smile, I shut the book, and gave the stallion my full attention. "Well?"\n\n"Everything is ready. Should be smooth sailing from here on out, Sparkle." He stated softly as he walked over, careful not to give anything that he did not have to away, in case we were being spied upon.\n\n"Good to hear. I'll come find you when I'm ready, then. Good evening, Scorecard."\n\n"And you as well, Sparkle." And with a nod, he was gone, as I settled back into my reading.

I'd have to request Daybreaker for further use of his services, once this was all over.\n\nThe four of us slunk into the next hall, and halted outside a particular room I'd known quite well. Princess Flurry Heart’s bedroom. Hopefully, the filly would be sleeping quietly, and not raise quite a ruckus. I softly pushed the door open, and, as my eyes adjusted to the darkness, my breath died in my throat.\n\nFlash Sentry, a massive handcannon of some sort in on his hip, exhaled gently, moving his hoof away from the holster.

I started to doubt the sanity of my brother - putting Flash Sentry in any position of responsibility?\n\n"Mind if I step in for a minute? I wanted to see Flurry Heart again..."\n\n"Oh, of course, your hi- ma’am. No reason you can't. You are her aunt after all. Just keep it down, she is sleeping."\n\nI flicked my gaze momentarily back to Scorecard, who nodded and fell back from the door, to explain to the twins, as I myself stepped inside, closing the door gently behind me. Almost mechanically, I lit a small light spell with my horn, cantering gently over. "It's been so long since I've seen her, it feels.""

 solarempiresparkles.17.t:0 "Complications"
 solarempiresparkles.17.d:0 ""I mean, you were here just a few weeks ago, remember?" Flash then paused, as if he'd started to say something, then thought of something else.\n\nMy heart fell to the pit of my stomach in dread, as I heard the tell-tale sound of Flash’s handcannon’s hammer being cocked. "Twilight Sparkle’s magic is magenta." He stated simply.\n\nI clicked my tongue, and turned about, slowly, so as not to provoke the stallion, maintaining my magical aura to avoid his suspicion. I didn't want to resort to my Kolibri- yet.\n\nInstead I used my magic to wrest the gun from his grip, as it discharged harmlessly into the ceiling. Flash closed the distance, slamming me into the ground, as the door to the room itself burst open. Jabbing a wing at my chest to expunge the breath from my lungs, his other tugged at a shrill- whistle, quickly brought to his mouth, as it sung out an alarm. A quick whip from Scorecard’s Welrod, directly to Flash’s head, knocked the stallion out, but the damage had already been done."
 solarempiresparkles.17.a:0 "Leg it!"

 solarempiresparkles.18.t_fail:0 "Caught"
 solarempiresparkles.18.d_fail:0 "I spun about, gazing at the door in shock, as pistol fire barked, splattering Scorecard’s blood all over Axle Grease. The twins spun about, their own weapons- knives- at the ready, and were similarly cut down by what could only be the Crystal Guard. I quickly tossed my Kolibri out the open window above Flurry’s bed, before letting my magic fall silent, holding my hooves up in surrender as Crystal Guards filled the room.\n\n"Twilight Sparkle of the Solar Empire, you are under arrest for plotting and attempted treason against the Crystal Crown, Espionage between two sovereign nations, and assuming Major Sentry does not survive, Murder. Do not resist."\n\nLike I had much of a choice."
 solarempiresparkles.18.b:0 "I was so close..."

 solarempiresparkles.18.t:0 "Slip away"
 solarempiresparkles.18.d:0 "Thinking quickly, I stood to my hooves, and motioned for the other three to come close. Wasting no time, I let out a flash teleport, as the room burst open, my breath momentarily catching in my throat as I came face to face with a very angry Shining Armor.\n\nWe found ourselves out in the snow, as I allowed my fury to swell, lending heat to myself and the others. I wished for nothing more than to bring the holy ruination of my Empress’ ruination down upon the Crystal Ponies. However, I had to remain calm and collected. The Crystal Guard would no doubt be looking for us, as Cadence’s insistence, so time was of the essence. Quickly, I formed a spell Matrix, centered on Canterlot, and lit up my horn. At least we would escape to tell the tale."
 solarempiresparkles.18.a:0 "At least I got out - but knowing Daybreaker, it might have been better to stay here."

 solarempiresparkles.16.t:0 "Success"
 solarempiresparkles.16.d:0 ""I mean, you were here just a few weeks ago, remember?" Flash then paused, as if he'd started to say something, then thought of something else.\n\n"Twilight, why is your magical aura yellow?"\n\nMy heart skipped a beat, and my brain froze, as I turned to face the stallion, who was more confused than concerned. I no doubt had a troubled smile on my face.\n\n"Oh, well, you see-" a quick flick of my horn, and the minuscule Kolibri- smallest developed pistol in the world, apparently, chirped four times, it's normally incredibly inaccurate 2.7mm rounds traveling the short journey from the barrel to Sentry’s barrel, as he flopped back, down and out for the count. Scorecard and the twins burst in immediately, carrying their own holdout weapons, consisting of a stiletto, another Kolibri, and a Solar Imperial made Welrod. I chanced a look over to Flurry; still sleeping soundly, and levitated her over in my magic, dropping the Kolibri- it's job was over. After awaiting a tense moment to make sure I wasn't interrupted, the four of us bunched up, my magic bringing Flurry close to my barrel, and I began to cast my oft-used spell.\n\nA few matrices and we were safely home across the border, Hollow Shades’ quiet farmhouses greeting us. My niece snored gently, bringing a wide smile to my face. "Gentlecolts: well bloody done.""

Her gaze itself was a poor attempt at recreating my Empress’, through to her credit, it could have frightened a lesser pony on a bad day. "No. And we both know the question for which the answer belongs."\n\nI pursed my lips, and nodded. "In the interests of peace and keeping my family from having to shed each others’ blood, I will ask anyways, Cadence. Are you willing to negotiate with Empress Daybreaker?" I then judged her with my gaze, eyes sliding upwards from behind my low-sitting reading glasses, as I took stock of her body language. "Or are we to spill even more Equestrian Blood this century?"\n\nThe Cold Hearted Princess of the Frozen North scowled openly. "If that is what it comes to, then that is what it shall come to. Begone, Solar Witch, on penalty of death if you see fit to return."\n\nI opened my mouth to say something in response, heat rising from my belly to my now smoldering mane, restrained fury building behind my eyes, as the frosty air around me hissed and crackled from the sudden change of temperature. "Very Well." I growled, resisting the urge to smite the upstart empress where she stood - such were the gifts of the Sol Invicta. But, I bit my tongue, turned upon my hooves, and left, head held high, and eyes brimming with fury at the embarrassment."

She gazed to me, then to the door, as if attempting to see the Solar Empire in the distance, far behind me.\n\nCadence exhaled, letting her shoulders sag momentarily, before drawing herself back up into the regal figure she always presented herself as. "Very well, Twilight Sparkle. Let us negotiate, so that we may keep the peace between our nations. Follow me if you would, to a parlor I am having prepared for us. Do you have a preferred tea?"\n\n"Earl Grey, if you'd please." I replied, following her with a thin, neutral smile.

Firstly, the Solar Empire has commanded, as in prior years, that we in the Crystal Empire return to the Equestrian Fold as their puppet state. Secondly, we shall be allowed to keep the Empress Cadenza as our ruler, though she will as expected have less freedom, and shall be more like the puppet Princess that she was originally supposed to be. We must now make a choice on whether we shall bend the knee to Solarist designs or not."

 solarempiresparkles.29.d:0 "I returned to the parlor with a quiet smile upon my face at Flurry’s growth into a young mare, as I left her and Shining to their own devices, and I returned to Cadence and negotiations. \n\nCadence seemed conflicted as I re-entered the room, though I declined to mention it, letting her bring up her thoughts on her own terms. "I believe, Twilight, that our negotiations are coming to a close... After reviewing Daybreaker’s terms, I have decided to agree unconditionally. You may return to her at your leisure, though you are always welcome to stay."\n\nMy smile widened slightly, as Cadence and I shared a hug, and I took a seat anyways. "Between you and me, Cadence, I think I need some time to relax. Mind if I stay for a cup of tea or two?"\n\n"Not at all, Twilight," She smiled in return, as I raised my cup of tea, warming it with my magic. "Not at all." With Diplomacy off our minds, we could finally return to chatting about normal things, and good times, past and present. Like we were a normal family, again."

 solarempiresparkles.30.d:0 "I nearly screeched aloud as I exited the parlor for a mind-clearing walk. I held it in, of course, as befitting a mare of my occupation and standing, but Daybreaker herself, it was tempting. I'd been debated into a standstill by Cadence over the past week, to the point I was ready to rip my own mane out and eat it. To call her stubborn would be an insult to the Obstinate and mule-headed everywhere. For the past two days, we’d gone nowhere, arguing back and forth and back and forth about the Empire’s eventual accession back into the Solar Empire. And, by extension, Cadence’s flat refusal to do so.\n\nFlapping my wings in frustration, I made my way to the Royal Garden- a poor mockery of the Canterlot Garden, though that was to be expected from a poor mockery of a proper Empire. Still, I could use the change in pace to gather my thoughts. Making my way to the central pond- kept liquid by permanent heating spells that kept it at a nice moderate seventy-two degrees Fahrenheit-  I paused, as I watched Flurry Heart playing with my brother, and her father - Shining Armor."

That was easier than I'd hoped. Turning to the door, I locked it, and levitated Flurry’s somewhat weighty body over to my own. She'd forgive me eventually.

You will take us to her, post-haste."\n\nWithin minutes, we were being lead through the doors of the castle itself, a cadre of Crystal Guards surrounding us, carrying very real and very loaded rifles, at parade rest. Not even worth the effort to dispatch them, really, if it came to blows. It'd take... perhaps fifteen seconds; eight if I actually cared enough to focus on them.\n\nCadenza seemed shocked, as I made my way towards her throne, until I was ordered to stop by the guards. \n\n"I come bearing a message from Our Empress, Daybreaker: She Who Raises The Sun, Sol Invicta, the Dawn Hammer, True Goddess of this mortal world, may she reign eternally." I bowed, formally, as I presented my ruler’s titles to Cadenza. After the requisite time passed, I returned to my standing position, and my Solar-touched gaze met that of Mi Amore Cadenza’s - for the first time since I'd arrived, as I relished in her fear and uncertainty.

My mane smouldered, as the odor of Sulfur bloomed in the air, and I grit my teeth. "Very well, you miserable excuse for an alicorn. Your chance was given. Now the blood of your peoples falls upon your hooves." And with my words spoken, I turned upon my hooves, surrounded by my loyal inquisitors and the Crystal Guard, and headed back towards the train.

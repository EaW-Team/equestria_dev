 ### Imperial Events ###
 imperial.1.t:0 "A Train Trip"
 imperial.1.d:0 "Despite his deteriorating health, the Emperor has decided to embark on a trip across Herzland via train, in order to showcase the new Imperial railway system and, more importantly, to convince the people that his days are not yet over. Reluctantly, after heavily protesting against the trip and arguing that he should stay in bed, the Emperor's doctors let him go.\n\nNobles and commoners alike gathered at Griffenheim's brand new railway station to witness the Emperor's departure. A shining steam locomotive had been prepared, with a dozen ornate cars attached to it, all built by the finest metalworkers and carpenters money could hire. The trip was supposed to be long and last several weeks, so there was enough space and supplies for His Majesty's entire entourage. When Grover V finally arrived on his personal automobile later than expected, the nobles raced to welcome him and showering him with praise about the railway project and how all would now witness the coming of modernity to the Empire. The Emperor nodded wearily, as he always did when receiving empty platitudes from greedy sycophants, and coughed. He slowly walked to the station escorted by heavily armoured Imperial Knights, and was next beset by the commoners who either lauded his project or begged for reforms to give them land and bread instead of expensive trains. When he finally got inside his private railroad car, he asked to not be disturbed, sat down, sighed and took a nap.\n\nThe train whistled, signalling that its journey had begun."
 imperial.1.a:0 "What's the worst that could happen?"
 imperial.2.t:0 "Back Home"
 imperial.2.d:0 "The railroad trip had been a rousing success. The Emperor and his escort had first gone from Griffenheim to Bronzekreuz, where loyal Diamond Dog nobles welcomed him extremely warmly and gave him many gifts. He then travelled to Readewetter where he spoke with Duchess Gabriela Eagleclaw, his dear cousin and friend, and then across the Grifking river to nearby De Vleugels where he enjoyed a quiet dinner with Duke Gerlach IV of Feathisia. Next his journey took him to Oldwingburg where the local Peasant Council welcomed him, its members offering their own fresh farm produce to show their gratitude for the railroads.\n\nSoon the Emperor arrived in the Free City of Romau, where Archon Erion XII wished to discuss politics with him in private but was refused by the tired Emperor who was not particularly fond of the infamous zealot. A day later he was in Greenback, where local engineers who had worked on the railway project were anxious to know if he had enjoyed the ride so far. When it came time to head to Angriver, the Emperor asked if they could just go home instead, but his servants insisted that they had to complete the whole journey so he would not, gods forbid, insult Baron Leer the Vicious and Princess Diellza the Insane. Grumbling, he slept until the train arrived in Griffing, but struggled to wake up. It was all in vain, it turned out, as the Baron had no interest in meeting him. The visit to Katerinburg was equally swift, so they would all avoid catching a curse or two. Then finally, after many weeks, the trip had ended and the exhausted Emperor returned home.\n\nBut on the following day, he barely got out of bed and complained of pain. Doctors promised to check him as soon as he had held urgent meetings with aristocrats. And so the Emperor met noble after noble, listening to their petty complaints, pretending to be listening to their pleas while trying to not fall asleep... until he collapsed without warning. Archon Eros VII who was advising the Emperor quickly came to his aid and accused the nobles of poisoning him. When he realized His Majesty had lost consciousness, the ninety-year old griffon tried to carry him on his own and shouted for aid. The Emperor was quickly rushed to his private chambers and is currently being taken care of by the Empire's finest medical experts. The Archon spends day and night sleeplessly praying to the gods."
 imperial.2.a:0 "His days might be over, at last..."
 imperial.3.t:0 "The Emperor is Dead"
 imperial.3.d:0 "Unfortunately, after nearly a month of treatments and therapy, ranging from latest scientific medicine to holy anointments by priests, Zebra potions and other exotic magical mystery cures, Emperor Grover the Fifth of his name was embraced by the claws of Boreas at the young age of 54. His caretakers said his last words were "Boreas, did I do good?"\n\nHis unstable and controversial reign has finally come to an end and all of Herzland is in mourning, with black flags hoisted from Rottendedam to Strathburg and Yale to Var-Silfur. His funeral procession in Griffenheim was attended by hundreds of thousands of griffons. His closest friend Gabriela Eagleclaw was the only vassal who arrived in time to participate, and was seen wearing a beautiful yet mournful black gown. Archon Eros VII held a fiery sermon at the end where he declared that an age had come to an end, but calmed down at the end and almost broke into tears. Five minutes of silence were observed in the city as Grover V was laid to rest in the Grand Temple of Boreas.\n\nSome would say that Grover V was a pathetic ruler, others would call him kind. Some citizens secretly despised him yet a few pitied him instead. His father Grover IV intended to personally groom his heir and make him into a mighty warrior, cunning diplomat and expert statesman, but died unexpectedly of a stroke when his only child was only ten years old. And so instead Grover V would become a neglected puppet while the nobles ruled the Empire as they pleased, accruing more and more wealth and privileges. The young and sickly Emperor was denied his throne when he turned eighteen and lacked the willpower to demand it, but it later turned out he did not need to do so. The Revolution of 978 brought a bloody end to the regency and the Emperor only survived thanks to Archon Eros' efforts. A counter-revolution gave him his rightful powers, but at that point he ruled over a tiny remnant of the once vast Empire, surrounded by vassals who demanded autonomy in return for their contribution to the counter-revolution. The Emperor spent the following tumultuous years trying to learn how to rule, which meant that many of his well-intended projects failed miserably. His last gift to his people and possibly his only accomplishment in life was the brand new Imperial Railway system that covered all of Herzland. He could be called incompetent, or simply most unfortunate.\n\nNow history repeats itself: Due to his only son and heir Prince Grover VI not being of the age in which he is capable of ruling the country himself, a Regency Council consisting of nobles, merchant princes and church officials shall take over the apparatus of state until a more suitable solution is found. We can only pray it doesn't end like the previous regency."
 imperial.3.a:0 "Boreas save us all!"
 imperial.4.t:0 "The Archon Takes the Stand"
 imperial.4.d:0 ""I was such a fool when I let the nobles ruin Grover V's reign. In the name of Boreas, I shall not let it happen again with his son while I still live."\n\nArchon Eros VII's furious steps echoed in the ornate halls of the Imperial palace. Even now, the nobility of the Regency Council was once again gathering in the chambers to pointlessly argue for hours. But this time would be different. Yes, Eros was filled with raw determination. He would not let history repeat itself. As he walked, memories of the past flashed in his mind, images of Griffenheim aflame, of terror in young Grover V's eyes as he led him to safety via a secret passage in the Palace. He closed his eyes and shook his head.\n\n"Never again."\n\nThe old Archon slammed the door of the Council's Chambers open with impressive force. The nobles and merchants in the room went silent and turned to gaze at him in surprise. Having already gained their attention with his entrance, Eros began to speak, passion and fury in his voice. "Fellow councilgriffs! I think we have wasted enough time bickering and arguing pointlessly. It is time for decisive action! Indolence, greed and indecisiveness brought the Empire closer to ruin than ever. Is it not clear that the concept of a regency council is flawed to the core? In these dire times the Empire needs a strong leader, and because the Emperor is not fit for such a position, someone else must take his place. And I do not propose it to be some noble who only cares for themselves! I say the regent must be a commoner, a person with a powerful enough will to restore stability and order in the Heartlands. This person should also be close to the Gods, so Boreas may grant us prosperity, so Eyr may grant us peace, and so Arcturius may grant us strength to smite our foes and destroy those who oppose the will of the Emperor."\n\nThe Archon looked at each councilgriff with a piercing glare, and locked eyes with Duchess Gabriella Eagleclaw of Strawberry, who responded with an equally fierce gaze. "I think we all know who is fit for such a position. Those who disagree may soon discover that the Gods themselves have abandoned them."\n\nThe room remained in staggered silence for a while before the merchants and priests of the council stood up and hailed the Archon. "We are with the Archon, and the Gods are with us!", shouted the Prelate of Kronburg. Soon others joined him and repeated the chant, drowning out any dissent from the nobles such as Gabriela.\n\nEros faintly smiled. The time for justice had finally come."
 imperial.4.a:0 "For the Empire and the Gods!"
 imperial.5.t:0 "The Duchess Takes the Stand"
 imperial.5.d:0 ""Poor Grover. He was too young, too fragile for this cruel world. But with change, comes an opportunity."\n\nThese were Duchess Gabriela's thoughts as she walked down the venerable halls of the Imperial Palace. As much as she personally considered the late Emperor her friend, she knew that he was no proper ruler. The conniving nobles, have abused Grover for too long and she was ashamed to share the same room with them. But that could be dealt with later on. She had a grand vision for the Empire. One that would make Boreas proud of griffons again, and more importantly, give the young heir a proper territory to rule once he is old enough. But first... She must deal with Eros and his thugs. Religious officials are such a nuisance.\n\nWith that, she stepped into the Council's Chambers. The Archon was already there, giving his "sermon" to the gathered nobles.\n\nWhat a bother. She took a seat next to the Count of Bronzehill, tuning out the speech, and discussed the situation in hushed whispers. Gabriela ignored Eros' grandstanding, until he finally decided to remove his old hide from the central podium. With that, she took her chance, strolled down to the centre and addressed the room.\n\n"My fellow nobles and other griffons worthy of respect. The esteemed Archon speaks well of the situation. We must have stability, and we must reassert our authority. But how can we trust the Archonate to provide for our nation?", she ignored the scowls Eros and his lackeys were sending her way, "They talk of war, but do they care for the little griffon? How can we get anywhere before we modernise our beloved Herzland, before we help our people? I implore you all to consider the right choice."\n\nCheers and applause followed... with a loud minority of jeers and claw pointing. It didn't matter. The council will back her claim for regency, and Eros will be marginalised, consigned to the altar where he belongs."
 imperial.5.a:0 "For the Empire and its noble peers!"
 imperial.6.t:0 "The Great Betrayal"
 imperial.6.d:0 "After nearly a month since we managed to secure the Regency Council's support for our cause it seemed as if things were finally calming down in Griffenheim after the initial power struggle. Unfortunately we were proven wrong, as today during a council meeting Duchess Gabriela Eagleclaw, Grand Duke Gerlach and other allies of her simply left the room, followed by numerous notable nobles from all across Herzland. Hours later, the Duchess announced the formal secession of the Strawberry Duchy and the Grand Duchy of Feathisia from the Empire.\n\nNews are also arriving of Greifenmarschen declaring independence, their Peasant Council outrageously refusing to recognize Archon Eros as the rightful regent of the Empire. Meanwhile Katerin... well, no one can tell what is happening in that cursed land, and the three Archons have other concerns at the present."
 imperial.6.a:0 "Traitors! Every single one of them!"
 imperial.7.t:0 "The Sad Truth"
 imperial.7.d:0 "The sad truth is that we simply cannot hope to fight against Eros on our own. If we intend to survive this mess we must convince our fellow lords to work together. Only then will we be strong enough to stand up to Eros."
 imperial.7.a:0 "Send out the messengers."
 imperial.7.b:0 "We can fight Griffonia on our own, thank you very much."
 imperial.8.t:0 "An Invitation"
 imperial.8.d:0 "It seems that the Duchess has once again called upon us to assist her. She believes that none of the secessionist states can hope to stand up against the Archon and his lackeys alone, and that we are inclined to agree with her. Furthermore, she has proposed a formal alliance between our two nations."
 imperial.8.a:0 "We must work together."
 imperial.8.b:0 "We can take on the Archon on our own."
 imperial.9.t:0 "An Invitation"
 imperial.9.d:0 "It seems that the Duchess has once again called upon us to assist her. She believes that none of the secessionist states can hope to stand up against the Archon and his lackeys alone, and that we are inclined to agree with her.

 imperial.11.a:0 "Great!"
 imperial.12.t:0 "Feathisia Accepts"
 imperial.12.d:0 "The Lord of Feathisia has decided to join the Griffonian Protection Alliance."
 imperial.12.a:0 "Fantastic!"
 imperial.13.t:0 "Greifenheim Accepts"
 imperial.13.d:0 "The Lord of Greifenheim has decided to join the Griffonian Protection Alliance."
 imperial.13.a:0 "Brilliant!"
 imperial.14.t:0 "An Offer"
 imperial.14.d:0 "It seems that after solidifying their position, the Council of Three has decided to end our autonomy without asking asking us or the Regency Council for consent. While we could most likely veto this decision in the Regency Council and garner the support of what few of the nobility is left, chances are the Archons won't take no for an answer. How do we respond?"
 imperial.14.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept."
 imperial.14.b:0 "To Tartarus with the Archons! Let them come!"
 imperial.14.c:0 "We've got the situation under control."
 imperial.15.t:0 "An Offer"
 imperial.15.d:0 "It seems that after solidifying their position, the Council of Three has decided to end our autonomy without asking asking us or the Regency Council for consent. While we could most likely veto this decision in the Regency Council and garner the support of what few of the nobility is left, chances are the Archons won't take no for an answer. How do we respond?"
 imperial.15.d_yale:0 "Now that the Council of Three is firmly established, they have decided to move forward with their plans to unify the Heartlands under the Imperial banner. Prelate Michael has anticipated this and has been lobbying excessively with his superiors to keep Yale an independent part of the Empire. Now the moment of truth has arrived, what do we do?"
 imperial.15.a:0 "We will give up our independence."
 imperial.15.b:0 "To Tartarus with the Archons! Let them come!"
 imperial.15.c:0 "We will serve the Empire best as a vassal."
 imperial.16.t:0 "An Offer"
 imperial.16.d:0 "It seems that after solidifying their position, the Council of Three has decided to end our autonomy without asking asking us or the Regency Council for consent.

 imperial.17.b:0 "To Tartarus with the Archons! Let them come!"
 imperial.18.t:0 "Romau Refuses"
 imperial.18.d:0 "It seems that [From.GetLeader] and the burghers of Romau have decided to defy us, wishing to retain their status as an autonomous Imperial Free City. They even had the gall to demand this autonomy to be expanded even further! Needless to say, they made the wrong choice."
 imperial.18.a:0 "Oh well, no one can say we weren't diplomatic."
 imperial.18.b:0 "Let them be, we don't need them."
 imperial.19.t:0 "[YAL.GetName] Defies Us"
 imperial.19.d:0 "[From.GetLeader] and the scholars of Yaledom, with their heads always in the clouds, have decided to deny our little request. All they wish is to be left alone to pursue their studies in peace. It seems, then, that Yale must re-join the Empire by force."
 imperial.19.a:0 "Teach them the price of defiance!"
 imperial.19.b:0 "Yale is of no importance to our future plans."
 imperial.20.t:0 "Katerin Defiant"
 imperial.20.d:0 "[From.GetLeader] and their legion of glorified hillbillies have once again proven to be idiots, as they've decided to not rejoin the Empire. Perhaps it's about time we show them the might of the Empire and restore order and civilization in their backwards marshes."
 imperial.20.a:0 "Let's crack some skulls!"
 imperial.20.b:0 "The Empire doesn't need that cursed land anyways."
 imperial.21.t:0 "The Obvious Suspect"
 imperial.21.d:0 "To no one's surprise, [From.GetLeader] and his followers have decided to defy us. While this was an expected result, it certainly won't stop us from taking what is rightfully ours."
 imperial.21.a:0 "Time to deal with Angriver once and for all!"
 imperial.21.b:0 "Let them rot in their forest for all I care!"
 imperial.22.t:0 "The Empire Strikes Back"
 imperial.22.d:0 "After a series of reforms, miraculous victories and countless rebellions, the long suffering Griffonian Empire has, under the guidance of the Council of Three, managed to reclaim the Griffonian Heartlands. While many of the still independent griffon breakaway states were hoping that the three Archons would be satisfied with the realm they've carved out for themselves, it seems that this will not be the case, as today Archon Eros VII, with his young protege Emperor Grover VI in tow, made a speech announcing that the Griffonian Empire shall not sit idle until all griffons are united under the Imperial banner once more."
 imperial.22.a:0 "A new Empire is on the rise..."
 imperial.23.t:0 "The Archon's Defiance"
 imperial.23.d:0 "After securing a victory for the nobility in the Regency Council and alienating both the eastern vassals and the three Archons, things were finally somewhat stabilising in the Imperial Capital. Until today, that is.\n\nDuring a regular meeting of the Council, Archons Eros and Proteus promptly denounced Duchess Gabriela and her allies as heathens and traitors, and later left the Capital. They were shortly afterwards joined by the Senator of Romau, Rector Magnificus of Yaledom and the Baron of Angriver. Several hours after these events they all formally declared their secession from the Empire. Soon news arrived from Oldwingburg as well, about the local Peasant Council refusing to recognize a noble as the Regent and formally declaring independence. Meanwhile Katerin remains ominously silent, and no one knows what is taking place in those dark marshes..."
 imperial.23.a:0 "Curse you, Archons and traitors!"
 imperial.24.t:0 "Facing the Facts"
 imperial.24.d:0 "We must face the facts. Gabriela and her lackeys are too numerous and strong for us to tackle alone. We must unite with our fellow lords and fight the heathens to the West!"
 imperial.24.a:0 "Send out the invitations."
 imperial.24.b:0 "We'll fight the Duchess on our own!"
 imperial.25.t:0 "An Invitation"
 imperial.25.d:0 "It seems that the Baron of Angriver and the now exiled Archon Eros have once more called upon us to assist them. They tell us that none of the secessionist states can hope to stand against the Duchess and her lackeys alone, and that we are inclined to agree with them. Furthermore, they have proposed a formal alliance between our two nations."
 imperial.25.a:0 "We must work together!"

 imperial.30.t:0 "Katerin Accepts"
 imperial.30.d:0 "The Prince of Katerin has decided to accept our proposal and join the Holy League."
 imperial.30.a:0 "Fantastic!"
 imperial.31.t:0 "Joining the Empire?"
 imperial.31.d:0 "The Duchess, together with several other allies of nobility in the Council, has decided to end the autonomy of what territories the Empire has left. This decision naturally also affects our lands. With our own Duchess as Regent of the Empire, should we accept and let Strawberry be integrated into the Empire?"
 imperial.31.a:0 "Our fate will be that of the Empire."
 imperial.31.b:0 "The Duchess has betrayed her own people!"
 imperial.32.t:0 "An Offer"
 imperial.32.d:0 "It seems that after solidifying their position, the Duchess has come to the conclusion that it would be best to end the autonomy of the Empire's territories and vassals. While we could most likely veto this outrageous decision in the Regency Council and garner the support of what few of the nobility doesn't support her, chances are Gabriela won't take no for an answer. How do we respond?"
 imperial.32.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept."

 imperial.34.b:0 "If she wants our land, she can come and take it!"
 imperial.35.t:0 "Idiocy in Action"
 imperial.35.d:0 "We have just received word that [From.GetLeader] has taken control over the Duchy of Strawberry. [From.GetLeader.GetSheHe] have managed to rally the population against us, in defiance against our demand for integration."
 imperial.35.a:0 "[From.GetLeader.GetSheHe] and the other traitors must pay!"
 imperial.35.b:0 "A foolish move... but we don't have time for family feuds, right now."
 imperial.36.t:0 "Feathisia Politely Refuses"
 imperial.36.d:0 "It seems that Duke Gerlach has somehow taken our demand to formally rejoin the Empire as something he can politely refuse. Additionally, he has 'politely' ended his country's vassalage and servitude to the Empire. What is our response?"
 imperial.36.a:0 "We politely declare war."
 imperial.36.b:0 "We politely step back."
 imperial.37.t:0 "Bronzehill Defies Us"
 imperial.37.d:0 "It appears [From.GetLeader] has gone mad, considering [From.GetLeader.GetSheHe] not only refused our request for integration but also insisted on no longer being our vassal. This backstabbing is baffling as the dogs have always been the most loyal servants of the Emperor and his closest allies. Their unusual act of betrayal must have some sinister motive behind it. It seems we can no longer trust the Emperor's best friends."
 imperial.37.a:0 "Up the mountain we go..."
 imperial.37.b:0 "There's plenty of other mountainous land to reclaim."
 imperial.38.t:0 "Greifenmarschen's Defiance"
 imperial.38.d:0 "The peasants of Greifenheim have decided to openly defy us and reasserted their independence after we called for the integration of Imperial vassals. It seems they wish to remain in their blissful, backwards and impoverished anarchy. Surely they are aware of the consequences of this decision?"
 imperial.38.a:0 "Let's teach these fools a lesson!"
 imperial.38.b:0 "The Empire doesn't need them, anyways."
 imperial.39.t:0 "The Empire Strikes Back"
 imperial.39.d:0 "After a series of reforms, miraculous victories and countless rebellions, the long suffering Griffonian Empire has, under the guidance of the nobility, managed to reclaim the Griffonian Heartlands. While many of the still independent breakaway states were hoping that Duchess Gabriela and her noble allies would be satisfied with the realm they've carved out for themselves, it seems that this will not be case, as today the Duchess, with her young protege Emperor Grover VI in tow, made a speech announcing that the Griffonian Empire shall not stop until all griffons are united under it's banner once more."
 imperial.39.a:0 "It seems there is still hope for the Empire..."
 imperial.40.t:0 "The Imperial Literacy Campaigns Begin"
 imperial.40.d:0 "While Grover V did much to improve literacy rates within the Empire, his work was left unfinished by his unfortunate and untimely death. Now that order has been established and a determined regent leads the nation, we can continue where he left off. Literacy campaigns have been initiated and education reformed extensively, with many new teachers hired especially from Yale. Schools are being built across the country and will be available for every griffon regardless of class. While all this is a drain on the coffers, it will ultimately be worth it as an educated populace is a productive populace."
 imperial.40.a:0 "It's a start."
 imperial.41.t:0 "Populace Civilized!"
 imperial.41.d:0 "Now that education has been made compulsory for young griffons, literacy rates are increasing rapidly. Every young citizen has the duty of memorizing the Imperial alphabet and learning to read many classics as well as the holy books. Teachers receive higher wages and their job is becoming increasingly respected, motivating many to study pedagogy. Every city, town and village within the Empire now has a fully staffed schoolbuilding. All our work and investment is starting to finally bear fruit as a recent survey demonstrates that even the poorest of the poor can read relatively well and write basic sentences. We are on our way to becoming a truly modern nation."
 imperial.41.a:0 "At last."
 imperial.42.t:0 "Fighting Illiteracy"
 imperial.42.d:0 "Our war against illiteracy is now almost at an end, with illiteracy rates at an all-time low and most citizens having completed at least a basic level of education."
 imperial.42.a:0 "The war is nearly over!"
 imperial.43.t:0 "Victory"
 imperial.43.d:0 "After many years of more or less forcing our people to educate themselves, we have finally managed to all but eradicate illiteracy within our nation. Our future shines just a little bit brighter."
 imperial.43.a:0 "Finally!"
 imperial.44.t:0 "The Coronation"
 imperial.44.d:0 "Today marks a wonderful day in the reconstituted Griffonian Empire! This morning, rising with the dawning sun, Grover, sixth of his line, was crowned Emperor. Upon coming of age, the young chick is no longer that, but a proud member and glorious leader of the Grand Empire. The ceremony itself was a beautiful affair, with the Archonate Choir providing all the soundtrack necessary. Archon Eros the now former Regent gave a short speech, calling forth visions of a wonderful and glorious future for the Empire. The crown was rested upon its rightful owner’s head, and the crowd present cheered for their new Emperor. Then, all were asked for silence, as Grover gave his speech. "Friends. Brothers and Sisters: We have finally returned our Holy Griffonian Empire from the darkness of this Generation. And even still, our foes stand against us, ready to strike. But this matters not. With the gods on our side, none can stand against us, truly. From this day forward, we will march confidently towards our destiny; not one step back!""
 imperial.44.a:0 "Long live the Emperor! Long live the Empire!"
 imperial.45.t:0 "The Coronation"
 imperial.45.d:0 "Today marks a new chapter in the history of the Griffonian Empire! On this bright and sunny morning, Grover VI, heir to the throne of the Empire, was crowned Emperor in full by the Regent, Duchess Gabriela. Following a short speech by the Regent, the Emperor himself took to the stage, and spoke of the Empire’s future prospects. "Friends... My people. Our past years, the years of my childhood, have been long and difficult. We have been made to fight - militarily, economically, and psychologically, against all odds and all those who would threaten our way of life. But today is not a day of war. Today is a day of success and peace, of victory and serenity. Today marks the end of our past, and the beginning of a bright future. The Empire has returned, and together, friends, we shall lead Griffonia into a new golden age. An age of peace and prosperity!"

 imperial.48.d:0 "The Noble Advisory Council, founded by the Imperial Regent, was created to both raise and advise the young Emperor Grover, as well as govern the nation while he matures. Certain members have been using their spots on the council to advance their social position or increase their own wealth. However, many of our citizens expect the nobility to be at least somewhat corrupt. Even still, it is hard to ignore, let alone tolerate an orgy within the imperial palace between multiple members of the council. The press, naturally, had a field day. The local authorities and witnesses... not so much."

 imperial.50.d:0 "Ever since we gave both funding and support to the Knights of Arcturius, they have been working tirelessly to improve the nation in any way they can. This has manifested itself in many ways, from building schools to repairing temples and more recently building their own paramilitary organisations. While these so called Squires are officially trainee knights they more or less fulfil the role of the Order's personal military police. This has increased support for the Imperial Regent and the Council of Three, but needless to say it has left some of our citizens slightly worried."

It is no secret that Rodier decided to leave his homeland after the Second Revolution due to his belief of Aquileia failing as a nation, thus he has come before us to offer his services to our nation in the hopes that he might one day return to his beloved homeland and liberate it from the Republicans and Communists that have overrun it."

 imperial.60.d:0 "An interesting book was published today, 'Of Things That Never Happened' by Barys Solartail follows the life of a character simply known as Ropshin, a Republican terrorist who has been ordered by his superiors to assassinate a Wingbardian noble. While the premise of the story is rather simple the writer focuses more on the character of Ropshin and his beliefs than the actual plot of the story, some critics have even pointed out that at times it feels as if the character and the writer are the same person. Nevertheless the book has been generally warmly received both by commoners and nobles alike."

 imperial.61.d:0 "For a long time now, politicians and military staff within [Root.GetName] have eyed the renewed rise of the Griffonian Empire across the sea with a great deal of dread. Today, their fears have been confirmed, at last. A formal request was sent to [Root.GetLeader] by the Empire, in which is stated that our land was once part of the Imperial realm, and that it still belonged to the Empire nowadays. They demand our immediate submission to the Imperial Crown, and that we return our status back to that of a colony of the Empire. This would effectively undo all our efforts of making ourselves a strong, independent country. However, it is without a doubt that the Empire is a force to be reckoned with, once more.

 imperial.63.d:0 "Those spineless cowards over in [From.GetName] have finally seen reason, and have agreed to our demand. [From.GetLeader] has already requested an audience with the Regency Council, willing to resubmit to the Empire. Our old colonial possessions finally return to the fold."

 imperial.65.t:0 "The Republican Dream"
 imperial.65.d:0 "A few days ago, one of the most famous modern day authors in the Griffonian Empire, Friedrich Winger, released his newest Book called 'The Republican Dream'. In the book, Winger looks back at the Republican Revolution inside the Griffonian Empire. He makes an effort to not only teach history, but also attempts to show that some of the Republican thoughts were quite progressive for the time, and they could still be a valid and necessary addition to imperial society today. After harsh backlash from public, Winger once again clarified that he supports the Crown, and that he does not affiliate himself with the Republic in any way. The book has so far been a moderate success in the Empire itself, but saw even greater success in other Countries, such as Aquileia."
 imperial.65.a:0 "A surprisingly interesting read."
 imperial.65.b:0 "A load of potentially dangerous nonsense."
 imperial.66.t:0 "The Imperial Banquet"
 imperial.66.d:0 "The Imperial Banquet is an ancient Griffonian tradition that dates back to the glory days of the Empire. Every ten years, nobles from all corners of the Empire would assemble at the capital of Griffenheim to spend one - sometimes even two - joyful evenings together. This helped strengthen our ties with the many dukes and princes of the Empire, and allowed the Emperor to improve relations with them.\n\nThe next Banquet is scheduled in just a few weeks, but our court is unsure about the exact procedures. Considering our weakened hold over the continent, it is unsure whether we should invite only those nobles still loyal to the Empire, or whether we should extend a claw to all who once were under our banner as a sign of good will."

Carriage after carriage arrived in front of the Imperial Palace, the most important of which were greeted by the regent, [Root.GetLeader], and even young Grover VI himself. This banquet was quite clearly one of the smaller ones, and the mood seemed to be sour at first. Soon, however, the memories of old returned to our guests, and the celebrations began. Games were played, words were exchanged, jokes were made. At the start of the Great Feast, the Duchess made a great speech. She spoke of ages long passed, and how it was the Empire's duty to carry on and reclaim its legacy and destiny. In the end, three cheers were had for our young Emperor."

It appears that despite our rivalry with the Empire, [Root.GetLeader] has been invited to the Imperial Banquet over in Griffenheim, an ancient griffon tradition that dates back over one hundred years. Many a dozen nobles have been invited, and we could use this opportunity to - just for one night - forget our differences and grudges with the Imperials."

 imperial.69.t:0 "The Banquet"
 imperial.69.d_vassals_only:0 "Once a grand assembly of Griffonian nobility, the Banquet was a rather awkward experience for all. Only the few loyal nobles arrived to join us and celebrate, and the grand Imperial Palace has never seemed this empty. The Regent and young Grover VI also attended the Banquet, and tried to improve relations with the few nobles that showed up, but it was a quiet, uneventful and awkward night, nonetheless. The once Grand Feast at the end of the Banquet was nothing more but a reminder of how large and powerful the Empire once was, as the vast majority of the room remained unfilled."
 imperial.69.a:0 "At least we kept the traitors out..."
 imperial.69.d_few:0 "The last night made for a rather disappointing and poor sight. Of the many nobles that were invited, only a small fraction decided to accept.[Root.GetGRIMajorsInvite] [Root.GetLeader] and young Grover VI attended as well, and attempted to lighten the mood in the rather empty-looking halls of the Imperial Palace. The Grand Feast marked the end of the celebrations, and yet many places on the table remained empty. The Regent thanked everygriff that showed up, and cursed all of those that remained home under their breath."
 imperial.69.b:0 "Shouldn't have invited them, after all."
 imperial.69.d_most:0 "The last night was a night of pomp and old glory. Many of the invited nobles made up their minds and accepted our good will.[Root.GetGRIMajorsInvite] The great halls of the Imperial Palace were filled with Nobility, truly reminding many of the old days of the Empire, and even bringing back nostalgia to some. The mood was light and joyful, and after some time even the deepest of grudges were forgotten about. The Grand Feast marked the end of the Banquet, and [Root.GetLeader] held a brilliant speech in which they thanked all visitors for their attendance and cooperation. During all the political rivalry and turmoil on the continent, the Banquet showed us that there can be peace between all of us, yet."
 imperial.69.c:0 "A spark of old glory!"
 imperial.69.d_all:0 "The Nobility on this continent appears to have seen reason and our good will, and all of them went ahead and accepted our invitation.

Among those nobles were loyalist as well as 'traitors', and even old rivals.[Root.GetGRIMajorsInvite] The mood was a bit shaky at the start, but the ice was soon broken, and old time grudges were forgotten in favour of light-hearted jokes and conversations. It seems that between all of the Griffonian politics, everygriff used this night to simply enjoy the company of each other. Even better, during the Grand Feast at the end of the celebrations, young Grover, with the support of the Regent, held a speech in front all of our guests, announcing his deep thanks to all of them, and stating that this night, if anything, is a sign that peace in Griffonia, between all of us, is possible, after all. We are griffons, in the end. The guests raised their mugs and cheered, and the Feast began."

 imperial.70.t:0 "The Griffonian Empire Demands Their Land"
 imperial.70.d:0 "The Griffonian Empire is a re-emerging force in the world, and securing an alliance with them was no doubt a good idea. But, as is common with empires, they do have a tendency to claim a lot of territories they have no direct control over. The Empire has formally requested that we transfer control of territories they deem to be theirs over to them. While the loss of this territory is not the most optimal situation, the risk of angering the Empire might outweigh the loss, what will our response be?"
 imperial.70.a:0 "Transfer the lands over to the Empire, we can ill afford to anger them."
 imperial.70.b:0 "We cannot bow to such a ridiculous demand."
 imperial.71.t:0 "[From.GetName] Accepts Our Demands"
 imperial.71.d:0 "Fantastic news! Our wise [From.GetAdjective] allies have seen that our claims to the lands they hold are truly just, and as such have agreed to transfer control of them over to us. This is a great day for all griffons, as the Empire takes one more step towards unification."

 imperial.72.t:0 "[From.GetName] Refuses Our Demands"
 imperial.72.d:0 "Our "allies" in [From.GetName] have proven themselves unwilling to recognize our rightful dominion over the lands they hold, and have denied our request of a territorial transfer. Is it truly right to call them our allies if they deny us this request?"

 imperial.73.t:0 "The Barrack Revolt"
 imperial.73.d:0 "Ferdinand Dawnclaw sat in his office, located in one of the innumerable military bases that dotted the capital of the Griffonian Empire. Ferdinand considered himself a patriot, and in a sense that was true. He did love the Empire in his own, strange, way. And it was precisely because of that love that he had to rebel. In his mind, the Empire simply couldn't survive without a radical change in the status quo. Could an already weakened Empire survive with a mere child in charge, with the nobles circling around him like vultures?\n\nNo, something had to be done. Ferdinand knew that his chances of success were slim, and that he would most likely just go down in history as another nameless traitor to the Empire, a fool whose futile rebellion was quickly crushed. Reports started to trickle in, his forces were converging on the Imperial palace, and soon they would face the palace guard in direct combat. Ferdinand could do nothing but wait, and hope that his soldiers could match the ferocity of the hardened defenders that they now faced. The next few minutes would decide the fate of the entire Empire and by extension the course of history itself."
 imperial.73.a:0 "The revolt is crushed!"
 imperial.73.b:0 "The soldiers storm the Palace!"
 imperial.74.t:0 "The Storming Of The Palace"
 imperial.74.d:0 "Against all odds, the few units that Ferdinand commanded triumphed over the palace guard, at the cost of heavy casualties. Ferdinand himself soon followed his soldiers into the palace, accompanied by his personal guard. What followed was brutal room to room combat, the defenders of the palace determined to protect the Emperor to the last. But Ferdinand's units eventually overwhelmed them, as the palace defenders fell one by one to a storm of steel and fire. And when the final guards fell, after hours of fighting, Ferdinand achieved complete control of the Imperial palace.\n\nHis soldiers soon set to fortifying the perimeter around the palace, preparing to defend it against any counter attacks. With Ferdinand now controlling the heart of the Empire, it was time for the next phase of his plan to unfold. In a radio address to the entire Reichspakt, he declared himself Lord Protector of the Empire and announced that a new government would take control of the state, until the rot that had infested it could be cleared out. Ferdinand now had to execute the part of his plan that he had been dreading the most, but that didn’t make it any less necessary."
 imperial.74.a:0 "Long live the Lord Protector!"
 imperial.75.t:0 "Securing Our Power"
 imperial.75.d:0 "Ferdinand Dawnclaw stood before the entrance of the Child-Emperor's room, the bullet-ridden corpses of the fanatically loyal Diamond Dog guards still sat where they fell. He knew what he had to do, the terrible act that he would commit to secure his power. The Emperor had no real authority, he was merely a figurehead, a pawn to be used by the various political factions that infested the rotting corpse of the once-great Empire. The child had to be removed from the picture if the Empire was to survive. And yet, he found himself unable to open the door, something deep in the back of his mind prevented him from doing so. Would this unforgivable act really be worth it?\n\nCommitting such an act would surely anger the entire Empire. Even the gods themselves would despise him for his actions. Was saving the Empire truly worth it? Would it be worth the weight of such an evil act? He struggled with himself for minutes, and with each second that passed by, he felt as if a noose was tightening around his neck. Finally, after what seemed like hours to the self-declared ruler of the Empire, he made up his mind. As he opened the door, a small part of him silently prayed for forgiveness. A larger part salivated at the thought of the power he would soon possess.\n\nThe act was relatively quick, and Ferdinand soon emerged from the Emperor's room. The part of the \"Lord Protector\" that had sought forgiveness was gone and only the all-consuming desire for more power remained."
 imperial.75.a:0 "This world is too cruel to children..."
 imperial.76.t:0 "Unforeseen Consequences"
 imperial.76.d:0 "When the coup was initiated, its leaders had known that the wider Empire would most likely not react favourably. Such a massive shakeup in the status quo would most likely anger the various nobles that governed much of the Empire’s Heartlands, and they would no doubt make demands for increased autonomy and other privileges. But Ferdinand Dawnclaw himself had predicted that the vassals of the Empire would fall in line one after another, as surely their loyalty to the Spirit of the Empire was greater than their loyalty to some puppet Emperor. Ferdinand would simply meet with the various nobles and archons that held true power within Griffonia, and work out a deal that would benefit both parties. That had been the plan, but it seems that the leaders of the coup had been somewhat... optimistic about the state of the Griffonian Empire. Quickly after the coup was finished, and the Emperor dead, something unexpected happened to the Empire.\n\nNamely the fact that it stopped existing. As it turns out, the second that the news of the Emperor's death reached the various vassal states, they all decided that they could not recognize the Lord Protector’s authority over themselves, and thus had no choice but to declare their independence. All in all, the only territory of the Empire that the Lord Protector "controlled" was the Imperial City and the surrounding countryside. And judging by the mobs forming in the streets, that control might not last long.\n\nMay the gods save us."
 imperial.76.a:0 "Quite suboptimal."
 imperial.77.t:0 "Panic In The War Room"
 imperial.77.d:0 "The headquarters of the newly established Regierung der Nationalen Rettung could, at the very best, be described as unorganized. Located inside one of the buildings of the former Imperial palace, the headquarters were hastily established by the new government after it became clear that the rest of the Empire was less than accepting of their aims. Within the building, an old storage room now served as an ad-hoc war room, with the entirety of the high command loyal to the new government located there.\n\nThe room itself was, to put it bluntly, a chaotic mess. Discarded documents and notes littered the floor, the walls were covered with war plans that had been drafted, re-drafted, adjusted, drawn over, and discarded multiple times over the course of the coup. Ferdinand himself was pacing around the room, with the various generals still loyal to him drafting up more plans and communicating with the other loyalist forces dotted around the city. The coup had been executed several days ago, and none of them had received any amount of sleep that could be called reasonable. Nevertheless, either through sheer desperation or a flash of brilliance they came up with a plan, and Ferdinand had every intention of acting upon it."
 imperial.77.a:0 "At least we have a plan now..."
 imperial.78.t:0 "Rifles At the Ready"
 imperial.78.d:0 "With the city growing more chaotic by the day, many thought that the days of the military junta were numbered. It seemed as if the mobs demanding the head of Ferdinand on a pike grew larger every day. And with the knightly orders and the remnants of the emperor's personal guard still lurking in the city, Griffenheim more resembled a powderkeg next to a lit torch than a city.  The few infantry units loyal to Ferdinand and his government left in Griffenheim now face a daunting task, managing the mobs with the meager supplies they have left until reinforcements from the countryside arrived to relive them.\n\nEvery single bullet and bayonet was rationed, with some patrols being forced to leave without ammunition in their guns, relying on intimidation to do all the fighting for them. The odds of survival seemed slim for Ferdinand and his young junta, and only a stroke of luck would allow him to survive the coming storm."
 imperial.78.a:0 "Just have to keep calm..."
 imperial.79.t:0 "The Battle For Griffenheim"
 imperial.79.d:0 "Ever since the coup was executed and the Emperor well... executed, the capital of Griffenheim has been engulfed in utter anarchy. Roving bands of rioters, supported by the remains of the royal guard, patrolled the streets of the city. Soldiers loyal to the new government frequently clashed with these bands, and it was not unusual for several patrols to disappear over the course of a day, their broken bodies eventually found in some dark alleyway, stripped of all weapons and equipment.\n\nThe days went on, and the soldiers of the coup were gradually whittled down to a shadow of their former force. The streets eventually became too dangerous for patrols and ever since, the remaining loyalists have been sitting in their fortified headquarters, waiting for other units loyal to Ferdinand to make their way to the capital. As rations and ammo slowly ran out for the defenders, many took to desertion, hoping to save their skin, but they soon found out that the mobs outside were in a less than forgiving mood.\n\nBut after 67 days had passed, the promised help finally arrived. Rows of trucks and tanks entered the city, and the roving mobs discovered that force of will tended to dissipate against concentrated automatic gunfire. With the streets finally under their control, the new government could finally start cementing their rule over Griffenheim."
 imperial.79.a:0 "Now back to business!"
 imperial.80.t:0 "Panzers In The Streets"
 imperial.80.d:0 "While the majority of the rebels in the capital had been suppressed when the reinforcements had arrived, the people of the city were still far from accepting the authority of the government. This was only worsened due to the incredible rise in crime across the city, with many gangs seeing the coup as the perfect opportunity to rob and kill as they pleased. The gangs gradually split the capital between themselves, with many fortifying buildings and streets of the city to serve as headquarters for their operations.\n\nTo worsen this, protesters carrying images of the old emperor were still common amongst the city. With some openly weeping and declaring their undying hatred of Ferdinand himself. It was clear that something had to be done, and luckily this situation presented the perfect opportunity to investigate how capable tanks were at suppressing urban populations.\n\nThe petty strongholds of the gangs were simply blown up by the cannons of the tanks, with the survivors being crushed underneath their treads. The protesters were commanded to stop, and when they proved unwilling to do so, the machine guns of the tanks proved very capable at persuading them to change their minds. At the end of the week, the city was completely under the control of the government, and the captured traitors could only wait for their eventual punishment."
 imperial.80.a:0 "That's going to be a pain to clean up..."
 imperial.81.t:0 "The Day Of The Rope"
 imperial.81.d:0 "As reinforcements from the countryside pour into Griffenheim, whatever thoughts of rebellion remain within the minds of its citizens are crushed. Ferdinand's forces simply outnumber and outgun the few griffons still willing to resist the lord protectors rule over the city, and for the first time in months, the streets of Griffenheim lie silent. One might think that Ferdinand would be pleased with this outcome, with the people finally accepting his rightful rule over the city. \n\nSuch thoughts could not be farther from the truth, as in his mind this calm is merely an illusion of safety, one that would shatter as soon as his iron-fisted grip on the citizens loosened. Far from putting his mind at ease, this course of events only served to stoke the fires of paranoia within his mind.. He knew now that the citizens of the Empire would never accept his rule without coercion, and he knew exactly what methods would be most effective in this situation.\n\nThe very next day, the difference between martial law and regular law within the Empire ceased to exist. The military would oversee every part of the legal and judicial system. It would act as judge, jury, and executioner, and would deal out any punishment it deemed nessicary regardless of the scope of the crime. Needless to say, the number of hangings increased drastically that same day, the citizens of Griffenheim receiving a grim reminder of the ultimate fate that awaited all traitors."
 imperial.81.a:0 "I rather fancy Griffenheim's new decorations..."
 imperial.82.t:0 "The Knights"
 imperial.82.d:0 "The Knights of Griffonkind were truly figures from myth given flesh, each one showed exemplary dedication to the higher ideals of chivalry and honour, and each one would fight with a shocking ferocity once confronted on the battlefield. Sadly, their sense of honour and chivalry proved their undoing, as the new government proved to be incompatible with these ideals. They had repeatedly made their problems with the new government clear, and in doing so had earned the label of traitors.\n\nThe Knights knew that they stood no chance and that they would most likely die useless deaths, and yet they still resolved to fight with all their power. At dawn, they marched against the headquarters of the new government, with the aim of capturing and killing Ferdinand Dawnclaw. The group which marched that day numbered almost a thousand, with many more across the nation waiting to strike. None would survive to the day's end.\n\nIn the end, they charged the defences of the headquarters, facing automatic weapons and armoured vehicles, and were cut down to the last. The time of chivalry and honour was over, only the grim reality of modern war remained."
 imperial.82.a:0 "Where is your God now?"
 imperial.83.t:0 "The Attempt"
 imperial.83.d:0 "Archon Eros the seventh is one of the leading religious figures in the entire Empire, and as such holds great sway over the hearts and minds of every griffon in it. He was also a dear friend to Grover the fifth, and with the death of his son at the hand of Ferdinand Dawnclaw, he has made it his mission in life to unite the Empire against him. He has been the public face of the campaign resisting the new government, lending an incredible amount of legitimacy and support to the movement. And when a griffon becomes a thorn in the side of Ferdinand, his lifespan decreases drastically.\n\nThe plan was to goad Eros into making a public speech in support of the movement, one that the government would grudgingly allow. A sniper on a rooftop would then execute him with a single shot, then declaring himself to be a republican sent from the Griffonian Republic before being arrested and executed for his crimes. The plan would unite the opposition with the government through the desire for revenge against the Republic, solving multiple problems with one dead griffon. Everything proceeded to plan, Eros announced his speech ahead of time, and the sniper had been perfectly positioned to take the shot. It was truly a flawless plan.\n\nWere it not for the sniper, who missed with all 12 shots. He was then captured, where Ferdinand made sure to personally execute him seconds later."

 imperial.84.t:0 "The Army Purge"
 imperial.84.d:0 "With the army now firmly under the control of the Regierung der Nationalen Rettung, the time had come to separate the wheat from the chaff as they say. The process itself was fairly simple, each soldier was asked of his opinion of the new government, those who answered disapprovingly, or had family members or close friends who did the same, were quickly singled out. They were then walked out to the firing line and shot, their bodies pushed into a mass grave, and said grave filled with cement.\n\nWhile some may suggest that our methods were crude and inefficient, the simplicity and effectiveness of a bullet to the head cannot be denied when it comes to dealing with traitors. This action was, however, considered very barbaric amongst the officer core, with Elias Bronzetail leading said officers. They had to be dealt with in short order."
 imperial.84.a:0 "They got only what they deserved."
 imperial.85.t:0 "The Death of Elias Bronzetail"
 imperial.85.d:0 "While dealing with the dissent of the common soldier is a simple, if brutal task, the treatment of officers is a far more sensitive matter. A large number of officers, led by Elias Bronzetail, have declared their open disgust at the conduct of the government and demanded better treatment. The rebelling officers demanded that their treatment be fitting to their status and that we accept their rights to hold whatever private opinions on the government that they wanted to hold.\n\nThis, of course, was treachery of the highest order, and the only punishment befitting such a crime was death by the noose. The offending officers were all rounded up, and over the course of an hour hanged within view of each other. One of the last ones to die was Elias Bronzetail, with his death being personally overseen by Ferdinand."
 imperial.85.a:0 "Thus unto traitors."
 imperial.86.t:0 "No More Nobles"
 imperial.86.d:0 "The nobility of the Empire had always been allowed more freedom of expression than the common folk, with the incredible amount of power they wielded necessitating such concessions from previous governments. Once the new government took over, they simply assumed that they would be able to get away with it as they always had. They constantly petitioned Ferdinand himself with requests of old rights and petty disputes, and some even demanded the creation of a noble council to ‘advise’ the new government on the proper ways of controlling a state.\n\nUnfortunately for the nobles, Ferdinand was not a griffon know for leniency to those who annoy him. So, he announced the creation of the noble council and asked every prominent noble within his territory to come to one of the towers of the imperial palace to discuss the powers of this council. However, when they arrived at the tower, the only thing they found a bullet to the back of the head, and a quick descent downwards from the window of the tower.\n\nNeedless to say, the nobles will not be a problem anymore."
 imperial.86.a:0 "They didn't fly so good."
 imperial.87.t:0 "Archon No More"
 imperial.87.d:0 "With Eros surviving the previous attempt on his life, his popularity and influence only increased. The government made several new plans to deal with him, each one more complex and detailed than the last. Poisoned food, explosives, yet another sniper. Pretty much every possible option was considered, and while these plans were discussed, Eros continued to spread his message. The problem had progressed to the point that a revolution by his supporters seemed inevitable, and the eighth delay of the assassination proved to be the last straw for Ferdinand.\n\nHe grabbed his revolver and a squadron of his personal guard and drove off in his car. He arrived at the Archon’s house and proceeded to kick the door in. Then he and his soldiers meticulously killed every single occupant of the house, until Eros himself was located. Ferdinand was the one who took the final shot, and it is said that it was one of the few moments in his life where he had smiled.\n\nAt the end of the day, the Archon was dealt with, and Ferdinand learned that direct methods often surpassed complex ones, provided they were executed with finesse and skill."
 imperial.87.a:0 "Say hello to Boreas for me, would you?"
 imperial.88.t:0 "The End Of The Anarchy"
 imperial.88.d:0 "With the last of his internal enemies dead at his feet, Ferdinand Dawnclaw has seemingly accomplished the impossible and survived the anarchy that consumed the Empire ever since his coup. Griffenheim now lies firmly under his control, and the surrounding countryside has been occupied by his forces. The Griffonian Empire may be an empire in name only, but it is an empire that Ferdinand now fully controls.\n\nBut Ferdinand was by no means satisfied by the meager parcel of territory he currently controlled, and he had every intention of restoring the Empire to its former glory, and perhaps even beyond. Every single pathetic traitor, every rebellious lord would be defeated and executed for their crimes, no less would do to satisfy the Empires new ruler. The Empires military now prepare for a military campaign that aims to recapture the entire continent and ensure that the Imperial flag once more flies across all of Griffonia once and for all."
 imperial.88.a:0 "Long live the Lord Protector!"
 imperial.89.t:0 "The War Against Illiteracy Begins"
 imperial.89.d:0 "An illiterate soldier is a useless soldier. It remains a sad fact that many griffons within the Empire, especially among the lower classes where most recruits come from, are barely educated beyond the most basic schooling imaginable. If the Empire is to reclaim its glory, and more importantly its territory, then this issue must be rectified at once. A comprehensive course aimed at getting every able-bodied griffon up to basic literacy in the shortest amount of time possible has already been drafted, and teachers across the nation are being rounded up to enforce this new curriculum. Attendance is strongly encouraged, and refusal to attend the classes without a very good reason is rarely met with a great amount of understanding from the police. "
 imperial.89.a:0 "Good."
 #imperial.90.t:0 "The War Continues"
 #imperial.90.d:0 "The war against illiteracy continues to progress at a steady pace. Ever since the new classes aimed at bringing the adult population up to literacy were set up, the amount of griffons able to read has begun to slowly rise. And with the help of the army, the populace is slowly beginning to learn the true value that lies in knowing how to read. The war is not over, not by a long shot, but we have made a truly prodigious amount of progress in such a short timespan."
 #imperial.90.a:0 "An educated griffon can conquer the world."
 #imperial.91.t:0 "The War is Almost Won"
 #imperial.91.d:0 "The fight against illiteracy within the Empire has made great strides, and the majority of adult griffons now possess at least some level of skill at reading and writing. Thanks to the strictly enforced new curriculum, more and more griffons are joining the army as well, with each course filled to the brim with inspiring tales of the heroic soldiers of the empire. The battle against illiteracy is not over, but the beast may very well have received a mortal blow."
 #imperial.91.a:0 "Wonderful."
 imperial.90.t:0 "Victory!"
 imperial.90.d:0 "Thanks to the wise policies of the Lord Protector, as well as the incredible dedication of his subjects, the curse of illiteracy no longer lies upon the Griffonian Empire. The educational campaign has been a truly astounding success, and the benefits of it are being felt at every level of Imperial society. The great war against illiteracy is over at long last, and we can now focus our attention on more pressing matters."
 imperial.90.a:0 "At long last!"
 imperial.93.t:0 "The Return Of The Slaves"
 imperial.93.d:0 "In a rather unexpected move, the Griffonian Empire has seemingly decided to return our slaves that fled to their lands many years ago. This came as a rather large surprise, as the Griffonian Empire has never shown any inclination towards such an action before. Perhaps it has something to do with the recent change in leadership within the Empire. But who are we to refuse such a boon? \n\nPlans regarding the use of the new slaves are already being drafted, though the weaklings amongst them must first be weeded out, a straightforward task. If they will not work, then they will at least provide some amusement before their death."
 imperial.93.a:0 "Well then... that's quite a surprise."
 imperial.94.t:0 "The Death Of The President-Marshal"
 imperial.94.d:0 "As the remnants of the Griffonian republic are shattered under the mighty armies of the Lord Protector, it was almost inevitable that one of the most infamous griffons on the continent would be captured. President-Marshal Kermerskai and his most loyal units, many of which had fought in the initial revolution all those years ago, were finally tracked down to a small fortress deep in the mountains. What followed was a protracted battle that lasted for several days, as elite special forces from the Lord Protector's armies assaulted the redoubt, gradually wearing down the defenders, until the only ones that remained were Kermerskai and his personal bodyguards.\n\nAfter a final confrontation in which Kermerskai himself killed several of his assailants, he and his bodyguards were finally captured. The President-Marshal was shoved into an armored truck, which then made its way to Griffenheim, alongside a convoy of armored escorts. Despite being ambushed several times by republican guerillas as they made their way through former Republican territory, the convoy eventually managed to safely arrive at Griffenheim. \n\nA few days later, the former President-Marshal, the griffon who had brought a centuries-old empire to its knees, stood before the gallows in Griffenheim with his wings restrained and a rope around his neck. Lord Protector Ferdinand stood at a podium only a few feet away, giving a speech to the residents of Griffenheim, announcing that the evils of republicanism would finally be banished from the empire. Moments later, the floor beneath Kermerskai gave away, and the dream of a republican Griffonia was finished off for good."
 imperial.94.a:0 "We finally got him."
 imperial.95.t:0 "Griffonstone Repaired"
 imperial.95.d:0 "Celebrations were held in Griffonstone today, commemorating the completion of the Imperial restoration program recently launched by the government at the behest of [Root.GetLeader]. The birthplace of griffonkind had truly seen better days before its reconquest by the Empire, as years of neglect had reduced the venerable city to nothing more than a glorified town in the midst of collapsing. When [Root.GetLeader] saw the sorry state of the city with his own eyes, he declared that the birthplace of griffonkind could not stay in such a state if the Empire was to control it, and mere days later work had started on restoring the city to its former glory.\n\n[Root.GetLeader] gave a rousing speech at the ceremony, decreeing that Griffonstone was a model of the many benefits that Imperial rule brought to the people of Griffonia, and declared that as long as he lived the city would not fall to such a low state ever again. The residents of the city were particularly appreciative of the efforts taken by the the Empire, and hundreds of the city's residents volunteered to join the Imperial army once the festivities were over.\n\nNow some officials have brought up the idea of moving our capital to the ancient home of the Imperial dynasty, which is in a more central position than Griffenheim. However, the latter remains more prosperous and developed, and moving the governmental bodies would cost a fortune."
 imperial.95.a:0 "I rather like Griffenheim."
 imperial.95.b:0 "Griffonstone is the true capital of griffonkind!"
 imperial.96.t:0 "The End of A Dynasty"
 imperial.96.d:0 "Prince Heavenly Snow, a popular figure in Lake City and the descendant of Blessed Sword, has served as something of a symbol for resistance against our rule in Lake City, with many resistance members rallying to restore him to his rightful place as the ruler of Lake City. This situation could not be tolerated any longer, so today Heavenly Snow was publicly executed in the middle of Jezeragrad.\n\nWe will make it absolutely clear that anypony who dares resist our rightful rule over Lake City will receive the same fate, and that only by accepting their rightful place as vassals of the Empire can the ponies move on from their pathetic defeat. And if they are unable to learn this lesson themselves, we will simply force it upon them."
 imperial.96.a:0 "Thus the legacy of Blessed Sword concludes."
 imperial.99.t:0 "A Traitor's Death"
 imperial.99.d:0 "Ferdinand Dawnclaw, one of the Empire's more recent traitors, was publicly executed in the capital today, with the event drawing little attention from the rest of the Empire. Ever since attempting a failed coup several days ago, the griffon had simply awaited his fate. Once the time finally came to lay judgment down on him, no leniency was taken and he was found guilty of high treason as well as conspiracy to commit regicide. There was only one punishment worthy of such evils, and he was sentenced to be hung from the gallows at dawn.\n\nThe griffon offered no defense for himself, staying silent through the entire court case, seemingly having accepted his fate. The execution itself was a subdued event, with a scant few military officials and curious onlookers showing up. Of the few griffons present at the event, Elias Bronzetail was the most senior in rank, showing up out of the little respect that he had for the foolish general. There were no grand speeches or denunciations at the execution, Ferdinand was simply lead up to the gallows, and minutes later he hung dead in the air.\n\nIn the end, Ferdinand Dawnclaw died a mundane death, one which was observed by few. He would be a footnote in history, another mad general driven by a lust for power, an insignificant traitor whose pitiful rebellion was put down before it could even start in earnest.\n\nIt was a fitting end."
 imperial.99.a:0 "Good riddance."
 imperial.100.t:0 "The Archon of Eyr Speaks"
 imperial.100.d:0 "Having been invited into the Regency Council by Eros, Erion XII went to Griffenheim from Romau as quickly as he could, travelling on Grover's brand new railroad. Several hours had passed from his arrival when he was already holding a speech in the center of the city. The market square was busy at that time, so soon the amount of griffons listening to him grew and a huge crowd formed around him as he kept on rambling and raving.\n\nHis speech was full of fury, so much so that he seemed more like an Archon of Arcturius. He condemned the nobility and called them decadent, lazy, corrupt, selfish, greedy, Maarite and several dozen other negative epithets. He blamed them for the Empire's decay, for Emperor Grover V's death, for the revolution of 978 and for every unfortunate event in the Empire's history. It was clear, he said, that the Empire needed to be purified and remade anew, the power of the aristocrats shattered and their plentiful land redistributed to Eyr's devout followers, for she was a Goddess of the Earth and Fertility and thus her bounty belonged to them. He asked the crowd how many of them worshipped Eyr and paid tithe to his Archonate, and most remained silent. Yet a few faithful ones raised their hands or flew upwards, and to them Erion promised vast tracts of land. Soon others in the crowd joined them and claimed to be followers of Eyr as well, vowing to donate as much as they could to Erion's Temple.\n\nErion grinned and said he would do everything he could to purge the unclean. He looked toward the Imperial Palace nearby, at Eros who was spectating the event from the balcony, and prayed he had liked his most powerful speech."
 imperial.100.a:0 "Praise Eyr! End to the nobility!"
 imperial.101.t:0 "Aiding the Commoners"
 imperial.101.d:0 "The long-prepared plan of Eros, Erion and Proteus was finally nearing completion. The clergy of the Three Temples had obeyed their orders and during the last few weeks the poorer districts of Griffenheim had been filled with new soup kitchens for the poor and hospices for the ill. All free of charge of course, funded by the Archons themselves. The commoners were grateful and many had their first warm meals in a long time. They praised the Archons and word quickly spread of their piety and generosity.\n\nThose nobles on the regency council who complained of this "senseless waste of money" and "blatant bribery of the needy" soon found themselves replaced with a commoner claw-picked by the Archons, as did the ones who whined about the replacements and said the regency council was reserved for privileged individuals only. One by one nobles were removed until only a few blueblooded griffons remained, among them Gabriela Eagleclaw. Her support was too great, Eros thought, and removing her could only end poorly. At least for now, he was willing to let her stay while they gathered popular support. Gabriela however had already realized what was happening, and already letters were being sent across Herzland..."
 imperial.101.a:0 "For the Empire and her people!"
 imperial.102.t:0 "The Knight-Archon's Speech"
 imperial.102.d:0 "When Archon Proteus III finally arrived in Griffenheim, he did not receive a warm welcome from fellow priests and Archon Eros, who chided him for being late and once again caring little for his sacred duty. As always, he shrugged off such criticism and left the Palace to speak to the people he loved and cared about. Word of Proteus' arrival had spread quickly and a huge crowd gathered to listen to their hero's speech as peddlers tried to profit off the situation by selling Proteus-related merchandise.\n\nAs soon as the muscular Knight-Archon appeared on the balcony of the Imperial Palace, the griffons erupted into cheers and chanted his name. Many soldiers had gathered there too and hailed their living idol. Proteus smiled in return and basked in admiration for a long while, even winking to female griffons in the crowd who swooned from his attention. Behind him Eros rolled his eyes and angrily told him to get started already.\n\nProteus asked for the people to calm down and they obeyed him immediately. He then began to speak, of the present uncertainty and restlessness in Herzland, how many had doubts about the future and feared another revolution. Everyone was especially anxious about the lack of leadership. Proteus then told that in such times one had to be brave and look to Arcturius, and have confidence in Him and His divine protection. If they remained strong and faithful to their gods, no matter what would happen they would not only prevail but prosper. He urged the people to not simply sit idly and wait for what would happen, but make preparations for the worst and never give in to fear. Their greatest strength came from unity, and unity came from sharing a single, noble cause. And that cause was ensuring peace, stability and integrity within the Empire no matter the cost, so all griffons could live a good life. He ended his speech with "Praise Arcturius!" and saluted the crowd, who in turn cheered and praised not only the God of War but him as well. As he turned around to go back inside, he looked at Eros and grinned. Despite the audience's response, Eros seemed unimpressed."
 imperial.102.a:0 "You have to admit, that was a good speech..."
 imperial.103.t:0 "Support Within the Reichsarmee"
 imperial.103.d:0 "While Eros had assigned Proteus the duty of preparing extensive administrative reforms for the Imperial Army, he had procrastinated on the duty and instead spent time with the soldiers themselves. When Eros was ready to once again rant to Proteus about his neglience and incompetence, he was surprised to see just how fond the army had become of him. Over the weeks he had practiced with low-ranking soldiers, discussed strategy with the officers and dueled with them. He had even organized a large sermon where they all prayed to Arcturius and he blessed the entire army in His name. As a result of all this, Proteus was now seen as the heroic figurehead of the Imperial Army and inspired countless thousands of soldiers.\n\nInstead of chiding Proteus, Eros decided to take advantage of his success. Printing presses began to churn out posters depicting Proteus as a knight clad in enchanted armour pointing at the viewer, with "ARCHON PROTEUS WANTS YOU TO JOIN THE IMPERIAL ARMY" written below in large, coloured letters. Tens of thousands of posters were plastered on lampposts, walls, fences, windows and trams. They proved to be very effective, with a constant stream of young griffons filling the recruiting offices and enlisting in the army."
 imperial.103.a:0 "We shall be great once more!"
 imperial.104.t:0 "Gerlach's Support"
 imperial.104.d:0 "Time is of the essence, thought Duchess Gabriela. Her little speech gathered support for her cause, but it was still inconclusive whom will the Council elect for the regency. The next matter to be discussed was the admittance of common-born griffons of some repute to the council... And that simply cannot be allowed. Eros' blatant populism would spell doom for the Empire if the actual commoners found out about it, and nogriff needs another 978. Fortunately, the opportunity presented itself.\n\nThe Grand Duke of Feathisia arrived in Griffenheim today, his coming unnoticed by most, as he was fond of travelling incognito. He was set to deliver his speech in the Council Chambers tomorrow, and while he is a pure-blooded noble, Gabriela suspected that the Archons' lackeys could persuade him to support an inferior cause. He can be irritatingly pragmatic sometimes. But the Duchess had her own plan in mind: she will invite him to dine at her Griffenheim estate and take advantage of his fondness for her in order to secure an alliance.\n\nThus, the evening came, the two noble griffons seated in front of each other at the Duchess' opulent dining room. Pleasant chatter was exchanged over a traditional Feathisian feast, with dishes such as snert and maatjesharing. Thankfully, he refrained from devouring the fish in primitive ways. It was certainly... unbecoming to be seen doing such. As Gabriela was about to make a comment on the latest gossip, she was suddenly interrupted by the normally tight-beaked Grand Duke:\n"Lady Eagleclaw, I do not wish to disrespect your hospitality, but I am keenly aware of your invitation's purpose." This came as no surprise to her, as she made a strong effort to flatter his sensibilities. In fact, he gave her an opening to cut straight to the matter at claw. "Forgive me, Grand Duke. But I believe it is within our mutual interest to stand together against the Archons and their wicked schemes. They can't be trusted to rule our legacy." As Gerlach silently considered his options, she pressed further: "Think, what would Grover want?" This got his attention, his eyes gleaming at the memory of the late Emperor... "So it is, Duchess. So it is."\n\nTomorrow, at the Council's meeting, Gabriela could only smugly listen to Gerlach's speech, lambasting the Archons for their irresponsible actions. This will certainly draw some of the indecisive nobles to vote for her regency. As his speech drew to a close, she thought about setting up another dinner. The Grand Duke is certainly easy on the eyes."
 imperial.104.a:0 "Your devotion will not be forgotten, Gerlach."
 imperial.105.t:0 "The Imperial Industrialists"
 imperial.105.d:0 "As Duchess Gabriela walked through the busy halls of Krähe-Stahl Offices, her thoughts were on legacy. The Empire may last for centuries or not even a decade, but its culture and achievements will never be forgotten. But where the state comes and goes, its inhabitants are eternal. And more importantly, the money. Great wealth is concentrated within the many companies dotting the business district of Griffenheim, and she knew that having their support could change it all. Thus, today she would dedicate her morning to one known as Ceron Greytalon, the most notable captain of industry in the city. He accepted her invitation for a meeting without hesitation, and before she knew it, she was sitting across the business magnate in his opulent office.\n\n"My dear Gabriela. What brings you to my humble workplace?", Ceron started with no hint of irony, chomping on his favourite Golden Griffon cigar, exclusive from Skyfall. "I'll need that favour you promised me, Ceron. I'll need your support, and your colleagues' assistance, against the Archons. You know we can't let them take over the state." Greytalon leaned forward, exhaling a whiff of smoke. The Duchess didn't seem to be hazed by it. "Your favours don't come cheap, Gabriela. What's in it for me, and for the Krähe-Stahl? I must work for my bread like every other griffon, you know."\n\nThe ever predictable Ceron and his greed. You'd think he had made enough in his lifetime, but some were never content. "Tax breaks. Subsidies. Exclusive government contracts. And we won't nationalise your factories, like the Archons would. They'd probably give it all to the peasants, too." Gabriela could practically hear the sound of Idols clinking in Ceron's head. Her offer would clearly improve his next quarterly report. "Then I believe we have an outstanding deal, my dear. The industrialists of the Empire will stand by your side." Claws were shaken, pleasantries were exchanged, and a proposal for the expansion of a middling business was drawn up. Primarily for the purpose of putting a good impression on the less fortunate, of course. The Duchess returned to her Griffenheim manor, an another piece of her plan put in motion. It wouldn't be long until she had everything she needed."
 imperial.105.a:0 "Ceron is a decent griffon once you get to know him."
 imperial.106.t:0 "Friends in the Eyrite Archonate"
 imperial.106.d:0 "Reputation can make or break a griffon, the Duchess knew this well. Many nobles were left disgraced once the attention of unflattering comments landed on them, regardless of whether there was any substance of truth in them. Sometimes, a noblegriff simply crossed the wrong peer... Such were the rules of the courtly intrigue, and Gabriela was keenly aware of them.\n\nWhich was why she decided to use these same tactics against the Archons. Although Eros and Proteus were unfortunately too beloved and incorruptible, the same could not be said for their weakest link, Erion. It was an open secret that he conducted himself in a manner considered shameful by even the Priesthood of Eyr's standards. Gabriela knew just how to exploit this situation: she was a friend of a local priest named Hephaestus, whose advancement was snubbed by Erion plenty of times. She was certain that he will be open to the suggestions of revenge, in exchange for an open seat in the Archonate, once the true order took control. With that, she began writing a letter, which would arrive tomorrow in Romau.\n\nThe following week saw plenty of controversy in Romau and beyond, as multiple accusations emerged targetting various high ranking religious officials. The common griffons were outraged to hear that their alms ended up funding extravagant parties, and worse yet, the tales of abuse committed upon young initiates. While many of these stories had few facts behind them, and while Archons still had their claws full on trying to minimise the extent of the damage, the public opinion swung back in the nobles' favour. Everything is according to Gabriela's plan."
 imperial.106.a:0 "Act as you preach, Erion."
 imperial.107.t:0 "Convincing The Niederer Adel"
 imperial.107.d:0 "The proper conduct of nobility is something every peer understood and upheld, at least that's what the Duchess believed. An exquisite upbringing, which would translate into a decent member of the high society, somegriff to look up towards. And yet to her eternal embarrassment, most nobles were content to engage in crass displays of debauchery, the kind that would make a priestess of Eyr blush in shame. Still, they were smart enough to keep it behind curtains, unlike certain lesser aristocrats. These landless lords would continuously make fools of themselves, clinging to their empty titles and dressing in fashion that went out of style decades ago. Despite being genuine wastes of Boreas-given air, Duchess Gabriela found a possible use for them.\n\nDespite holding functionally vacuous titles, of the lands that haven't been under Imperial control for decades, they were still peers, recognised by the Imperial Court. As such, should a sufficient number present their cause to the Regency Council, there would be no choice but to be accepted. Gabriela only needed a few more claws on her side to claim the regency for herself, and despite the distaste for their mockery of the peerage, went forth to persuade a sufficient number. It would be a busy day, but at least she knew where most of them spent their days. It would be a simple matter what to say and promise, and no guarantee for following on them later on.\n\nThe following day at the session of the Regency Council had an unusual commotion, as a dozen foppish nobles interrupted the session and demanded that "their privileges to be given and respected". The guards were close to kicking them out on the streets, but the Duchess interrupted, saying that their titles are legitimate. Thus they joined their colleagues, and when the vote came, they all voted unanimously for Gabriela Eagleclaw. The Archons were furious at being foiled yet again!"
 imperial.107.a:0 "They may be upstarts, but they're better than Eros..."
 imperial.108.t:0 "End Of The Republican Dream"
 imperial.108.d:0 "President-Marshal Kermerskai was executed by hanging in the Imperial square in Griffenheim today. The people had anticipated this day ever since his capture at the hands of an elite griffon special forces unit during the fall of the bandit state known as the Griffonian Republic, and the crowd at the execution itself was truly massive. There was no trial given to Kermerskai, with the government stating that his crimes were so blatant and irrefutable that dignifying them with a trial would be akin to spitting on the very concept of justice. Any griffon who disagreed with this statement quickly changed his mind or was arrested as a Republican sympathizer.\n\nKermerskai was marched to a wall and offered a blindfold and cigarette, both of which he refused. The execution itself occurred mere seconds later and was closely observed by the Imperial Regent [Root.GetLeader] who was quite pleased to put an end to the disgrace the Empire has suffered for over 30 years, and the young Emperor himself, who flinched when the hanging took place but nevertheless was happy to see his father's humiliation finally avenged. The Griffonian republican movement is unlikely to recover after this event."

 GRI_fix_bureaucracy:0 "Deal With the Bureaucrats"
 GRI_fix_bureaucracy_desc:0 "Due to our fairly outdated and overly complicated bureaucracy, doing anything official within our borders takes weeks or even months. It's time we trim the fat and streamline the whole bloated rotten structure before it all comes crashing down upon itself. Who cares how many bureaucrats become unemployed? Most of them are leeches anyways."
 GRI_burgher_support:0 "Garner Support From the Burghers"
 GRI_burgher_support_desc:0 "Although not as powerful or influential as the merchants and traders within the Trade Federation to our west, the burgher class are still a viable ally to have.

 GRI_holy_order_desc:0 "The Knights of Arcturius, founded in 357, are the militant branch of the Arcturian Archonate and have served the Empire faithfully for centuries.

 GRI_reward_loyalty:0 "Reward the Faithful"
 GRI_reward_loyalty_desc:0 "The rulers of southern Herzland served us faithfully once, which is all good and true. Yet the new order in the Empire cannot tolerate this loose decentralisation and dissidence, for we must all work together closely for the good of the Empire. Thus, they shall receive a perfectly reasonable offer to either rejoin the Empire, or suffer the consequences of unholy treason."
 GRI_ROU_uni:0 "Fund the Southern Universities"
 GRI_ROU_uni_desc:0 "The Universities of Romau and Yale are some of the oldest universities in the entirety of the Griffonia and have been the stomping ground of many of the greatest minds in the history of our race.

Additional state funding would lower these fees and allow many more sharp minds to enroll."
 GRI_education_effort:0 "Start a Literacy Campaign"
 GRI_education_effort_desc:0 "Without modernisation, our Empire will crumble. However, we can't hope to modernise without granting our people basic education. It will take some time, but we must start our literacy campaign now rather than later.

 GRI_greenback_stuff_desc:0 "A vital resource for aircraft production, aluminium should be a high priority for us to secure.

 GRI_monasteries:0 "State Eleos"
 GRI_monasteries_desc:0 "Archon Erion XII has proposed that we restore the concept of Imperial Eleos. Eleos, in essence, is the concept of providing for others as an act of virtue, to spread prosperity to less fortunate griffons in the name of Boreas. Erion reckons that restoring it on a national level would be a great way to garner more support from our poorer populace and earn the favour of the gods."
 GRI_farms:0 "Clearing Out the Scheißwald"
 GRI_farms_desc:0 "The Scheißwald, a forest spanning most of Angriver and Katerin has impeded Griffons from developing much of the eastern Herzland for centuries now.

 GRI_invite_erion:0 "Eyr's Chosen"
 GRI_invite_erion_desc:0 "Even from the earliest days of its founding it was obvious that the Archon of Eyr was the weakest link in the Council of Three, and now with our hold over the Imperial regency ensured we can install our own candidate for the Archon of Eyr. It's not as if Erion can do much about it anyhow..."
 GRI_crush_FEA:0 "Crush the Feathisian Resistance"

 GRI_go_after_vedina:0 "Emperor Grover I's Only Mistake"
 GRI_go_after_vedina_desc:0 "While Vedina was nominally an Imperial subject, in truth they were completely independent and cared little for the Empire.

 GRI_hang_the_traitor:0 "Hang the Traitor"
 GRI_hang_the_traitor_desc:0 "After so many long years, Kemerskai has finally been caught and will be brought to justice.

 GRI_core_the_north:0 "Reintegrate the North"

 GRI_rebuild_griffinstone_imperial_desc:0 "After the tragic death of King Guto VI, Griffonstone was left without a leader and much like the Empire a bickering regency council was unable to run the country properly. As a result the former pride of griffonkind became dilapidated and poverty-stricken. To honour the memory of the King and to please the young Emperor, we must restore the city to its former glory, no matter how much it costs."
 GRI_core_center:0 "Reintegrate Central Griffonia"

 GRI_core_west:0 "Reintegrate the West"
 GRI_core_west_desc:0 "Aquileia and its neighbouring regions have all been brought back into the fold. But this time we will not repeat the mistake of past Emperors.

 GRI_core_south:0 "Reintegrate the South"
 GRI_core_south_desc:0 "The "Free South" will be a thing of the past. No more shall Wingbardy and their former allies be subject states. Instead, they will be reorganized into an Imperial province.

 GRI_agricultural_support_desc:0 "Through the system of feudalism and serfdom, agriculture has been the Empire's speciality for millenia. However, our outdated agricultural sector cannot hope to compete with industrialized nations. With governmental incentives we can aid our farm estates and allow them to modernize their production methods."
 GRI_industrial_farms:0 "Agricultural Mechanisation"
 GRI_industrial_farms_desc:0 "Who is to say industrialisation and agriculture can't aid one another? By adding machines to our agricultural sector, we can mechanise and automise a large chunk of the process, greatly improving productivity and increasing migration from the countryside to the cities as the need for workers on the farms drops."
 GRI_breadbasket_of_griffonia:0 "The Breadbasket of Griffonia"
 GRI_breadbasket_of_griffonia_desc:0 "Through our dedication to the agricultural sector, we have renewed prosperity on the countryside, and our citizens once again live without fearing hunger. There's enough food for everyone, and plenty more leftover for export."
 GRI_krahe_contract:0 "The Krähe-Stahl Contract"
 GRI_krahe_contract_desc:0 "The Krähe-Stahl company is the oldest industrial company in the Empire, being the ones who brought industrialisation to the Empire. By reaching an agreement with them, we could not only encourage their growth, but also reap the benefits of their work."
 GRI_imperial_railway:0 "Expand The Imperial Railway"
 GRI_imperial_railway_desc:0 "Grover V's effort in creating an Imperial railway was admirable, but he did not go far enough and merely created the backbone of a proper rail network. We shall now honour his memory by continuing his work and connecting even the most remote corners of the Empire with rail."
 GRI_crona_industry:0 "The Reichswaffen Contract"
 GRI_crona_industry_desc:0 "Reichswaffen is the most prominent weapons manufacturer, and was founded by a childhood friend of Grover IV. As such, the emperors have had good relations with the company ever since. We should renew this friendship and our mutual ties to ensure that the Empire is not without claws."
 GRI_tech_schools:0 "The Griffonian Standard"

 GRI_electronics_department:0 "Subsidise Blautronik"

 GRI_humanities_department:0 "Cultural R&D Department"
 GRI_humanities_department_desc:0 "While none can deny the benefits of practical research and material science, we must not ignore our cultural heritage. A special department shall be established to preserve our history, language and culture, teach it to new generations and above all instill a pan-Griffonian identity in them."
 GRI_northern_roads:0 "Connect the North"
 GRI_northern_roads_desc:0 "The north has once more rejoined the Empire's warm embrace. However, local autonomy during Grover V's rule meant that railroads had to use different track gauges in different countries due to local laws and regulations. By replacing their rails with new ones that conform to an Imperial standard, we can greatly ease travel."
 GRI_take_northern_industry:0 "Nationalise Northern Industry"
 GRI_take_northern_industry_desc:0 "The conurbation consisting of the cities of Mirabelle, Readewetter and De Vleugels was the biggest industrial center of Strawberry and Feathisia. Now, with these lands under imperial rule once again, it is the biggest industrial center in the Heartlands. We must nationalise these newly gained industrial assets to use them to our advantage."
 GRI_oil_oil_oil:0 "Black Gold"
 GRI_oil_oil_oil_desc:0 "Oil shall be the most important resource in the new millenium. Not just for the machines of war, but also for civilian usage. It would be best to commence extracting this resource at once, so that our stockpile can grow. Additionally, we shall look into ways of creating synthetic resources, should natural yields begin to diminish."
 GRI_southern_roads:0 "Into the Scheißwald"
 GRI_southern_roads_desc:0 "The south is once more under our rule, but local infrastructure is lacking. Grover V's railway project did not cover the area as extensively as in the north, mostly because of the vast and horrible Scheißwald forest. This time we will not let ourselves be intimidated by mere trees! We will use modern machines to carve paths through the forest."
 GRI_take_southern_industry:0 "Invest In The South"
 GRI_take_southern_industry_desc:0 "Southern Herzland is comparatively less developed than the north, but it still has potential. If we invest imperial funds into the pre-existing urban centers of Romau, Greenback and Griffing, we can boost the economy of the region considerably."
 GRI_skyfall_dockyards_focus:0 "Repair the Skyfall Handelshafen"
 GRI_skyfall_dockyards_focus_desc:0 "The Skyfall trade port is the biggest in all of Griffonia, and was once the Empire's crown jewel when it came to naval power. Now we have regained control over Skyfall and its valuable ports. It is time to renew them and show the world our maritime prowess once again!"
 GRI_skyfall_industry:0 "No More Trade Princes"
 GRI_skyfall_industry_desc:0 "The coastal provinces of Skyfall are dominated by merchants and trade princes who hold a large amount of power over local infrastructure and industry.

 GRI_designated_industrial_zones:0 "Designated Industrial Zones"

 GRI_expand_the_reserves_desc:0 "While the Imperial Army has always been a professional one at its core, its numbers were bolstered by numerous reservists, part-time soldiers who were civilians unless called to service. However, this system hasn't seen change for decades. Adopting new policies and reforming the system will provide us an expanded pool of griffonpower to draw from."

 GRI_rifle_modernisation_desc:0 "Every soldier has traditionally been supplied with everything they need, but a modern soldier needs more than a soldier of the past did.

 GRI_doctrinal_adaptation:0 "Doctrinal Adaptation"

We must adapt quickly, or else we will die."
 GRI_special_forces_inititaitve:0 "Create The RAfSK"
 GRI_special_forces_inititaitve_desc:0 "The Reichsarmee Abteilung für Sonderkriegsführung seeks to improve and expand our training of military specialists: Paratroopers, marines and mountaineers.

 GRI_develop_enigma_code:0 "The Secret War"
 GRI_develop_enigma_code_desc:0 "As warfare becomes more complex and communication more instant and vital, secrecy grows in importance as well.

 GRI_harder_plating:0 "Increased Plating Standards"
 GRI_harder_plating_desc:0 "While light tanks are very mobile, they are not particularly resilient and are easy to pierce.

 ### Advisors ###
 archon_proteus:0 "Archon Proteus III"
 archon_erion:0 "Archon Erion XII"
 archon_erion_desc:0 "Youngest of the three Archons, born in 959, Erion XII has risen rapidly through the ranks of the Eyrite Temple to the very top. However, this was not achieved by exceptional piety alone, nor by hard and honest work. Erion is ever hungry for more power and is not afraid to use more questionable and violent means to gain it. Now that he has achieved supremacy in the Archonate of Eyr itself, he seeks to grow his temporal power as well./n/nAll this has made Erion rather unpopular among the nobility and the clergy, who see him as a threat and a lunatic. The hatred is mutual, as Erion often rants about the corruption of the nobles of Griffonia and the senators of Romau, and the incompetence and lack of zealotry of the priesthood. Many commoners are swayed by his fiery and passionate speeches, especially among the lower classes. Erion’s control of education contributes to this as young students are indoctrinated and turned into faithful servants of Eyr./n/nWhile Erion is power-hungry, none can deny he is a devout Eyrite as well. His parents, poor industrial workers in Romau, were very religious and conservative, and sent all their children to a temple school. There, the eyes of their youngest child, Lorenz Whitefeather, were opened and he became a faithful servant of Eyr, the goddess of fertility and family. After becoming an Archon, Lorenz chose the archonal name of Erion. Even to this day, Erion sends money to his old parents, and preaches the importance of traditional values./n/nErion has a tenuous relationship with his fellow Archons of the Borean and Arcturian temples. As Eros is one of the most influential griffons in Heartlands, Erion always seeks to impress him and earn his favour, so Eros would entrust him with more power. Eros sees through his act, however, but sees him as a useful if dangerous pawn. Proteus on the other claw openly distrusts and dislikes Erion, and Erion despises him in return for his lack of piety and neglect of clerical duty. The two only work together because they must."

 ### Country leader descriptions ###
 grover_v_desc:0 "Nominally the Emperor of all Griffonia, Grover V has had a difficult life. Never the most healthy of griffons, he has lost his father to a stroke, and with that, woe soon came to the Empire. The loss of the Idol of Boreas, the Republican Uprising of 978, millions of dead griffons - Grover could only watch and weep as the events unfolded. Nonetheless, the Emperor could count on his good friends, notably Archon Eros VII and Duchess Gabriela Eagleclaw, to keep him safe from the worst and guide him in ruling what remained of loyalists. An unifying force for the Heartlands, Grover has developed a sense of grim determination and does his best to maintain the Empire's legacy, regardless of his personal issues."
 eros_vii_desc:0 "One of the oldest living griffons, Archon Eros VII was born when the Empire was at the height of its power. At a young age, he joined the priesthood of Boreas out of genuine respect for the Gods. His pious devotion and humble manner has led him to quickly rise to the position of Archon, and all seemed well. Yet cruel fate had in store to render the Empire asunder, with the loss of the Idol of Boreas and the incompetent Council of Regents dragging the country to the ground. He was responsible for saving the young Grover V's life from the claws of Republican insurgents, and has maintained a close friendship with him ever since. This is why he protects the late Emperor's son, Grover VI, and hopes that once his regency is over, he will rule an unified Empire. Yet Eros has little love for the nobility of the Empire, believing them to be responsible for every misfortune that has plagued the Heartlands. And now, with the broad support of the commonfolk, Eros and his fellow Archons are attempting the restore the Empire's glory. The traitors and unbelievers will pay with their blood, Boreas wills it!"
 pink_birb_desc:0 "First cousin to the Emperor, Duchess Gabriela Eagleclaw is one of most powerful nobles in the Heartlands and Grover the Fifth's personal friend. Her charisma and force of personality, not to mention her sizable personal properties and wealth, has placed her in a position where she can command most of the petty lords. She has always championed for the cause of her peers, but she is not blind to the plight of the common griffon and wishes to introduce limited reforms to the system, genuinely wishing for the people to have a good life, proud of their country. All she does, she does it in honour of her friend, the late Emperor, and holds in contempt the Archons, believing that they'll ruin the country with their dangerously radical ideas. Until the Emperor's son is old enough to ascend to the throne, Gabriela balances her many responsiblities and leads the Empire to a new dawn."
 
 ### General Descriptions ###
 GRI_elias_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 23rd of July, 939 in Landstal\n\n§YRank§!: Generalfeldmarschall\n\n§YBiography§!: Elias Bronzetail was born in Landstal as the youngest of eight children of the oil entrepreneur Ernst Bronzetail and Aquileian socialite Yvette Pierrat. In 957 the young Elias finished his secondary education, but with no hope of ever inheriting his father's business he chose to become an army cadet at the prestigious Groverianische Reich Militärakademie in Helheim.\n\nIn spite of some initial hurdles Elias quickly proved himself an adept strategist and a masterful if rather stubborn planner. While his blunt demeanour and oftentimes mirthless attitude did not exactly earn him many friends, he nevertheless managed to find a sense of camaraderie and some would say friendship with fellow cadet Erich Ebonwing: who like Elias himself would go on to earn the rank of Generalfeldmarschall.\n\nElias began to steadily climb the Reichsarmee hierarchy, which was frequently dominated by nobility. However, Elias would only truly earn a place in the eyes of the Empire at-large during the Republican Revolution of 978; the constant delays his troops caused the Republicans proved to be crucial in allowing the Loyalist forces to regroup, and his victory over General Reinhard Suntail at the Battle of Crona in 979 earned him the rank of Generaloberst. In 991 Elias finally achieved the rank of Generalfeldmarschall due to both his skill and his many years of service\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Echo"
 GRI_erich_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 27th of September, 938 in Crona\n\n§YRank§!: Generalfeldmarschall\n\n§YBiography§!: Erich Ebonwing was born in Crona as the eldest and only child of the affluent Baron Germund Ebonwing and Rhea Steinheil; the daughter of a merchant from Ravensburg. The young Erich spent his youth in abjact luxury - partying and drinking his days away, caring little for his studies. Thus it came as a surprise to both his friends and his family when he chose to attend the Groverianische Reich Militärakademie in Helheim.\n\nEbonwing would to the surprise of many prove himself a capable officer, a resourceful leader and a fierce combatant - All of these factors coupled with his natural charisma and force of personality managed to win him the respect of many of his peers, the most notable of which was the usually mirthless Elias Bronzetail.\n\nDue to his noble background Erich was able to advance his career rapidly. However, it would be during the Republican Revolution of 978 when Ebonwing truly showed his prowess as a military commander. Beating the Republicans at the Battles of Vinnin, Gamia and Osnabeak the young Oberst quickly became a media darling and a living propaganda tool, in spite of his prowess he could not stop the so called 'Rape of Crona' an event that affected him deeply. Thus, it came as no surprise that when the Republicans were finally chased out of Griffenheim in 979 that it was Ebonwing who gave chase. Chasing them from Griffenheim to Brenna, Ebonwing would have more than likely contiuned hounding the Revolutionaries all the way to Cloudbury had he and his troops not been recalled back to Griffenheim in order to assist in restoring order to the Imperial Heartlands.\n\nFor his actions during the Revolution Ebonwing would much like his friend and comrade Elias be promoted; first to the rank of Generaloberst in 981, and finally to the rank of Generalfeldmarschall in 996\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
 GRI_ferdinand_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 10th of March, 965 in Griffenheim\n\n§YRank§!: Oberstleutnant\n\n§YBiography§!: Ferdinand Dawnclaw was born in the slums of Griffenheim. A sickly and weak albino, whoever his parents were had simply opted to leave the young griffon in the care of the Arcturian Archonate.\n\nThis decision would not only save Ferdinand's life, but ultimately, propel him to greatness, as it was precisely due to his upbringing within the Arcturian priesthood that he was able to flourish into the formidable griffon he is today.\n\nIn spite of his sickly disposition, Ferdinand's priestly caretakers quickly noticed the young griffon's sharp mind and eye for detail; talents which they quickly chose to cultivate. By 978, Ferdinand was well on his way to becoming an Arcturian priest, and he might well have become one had a simple event not occurred - The Republican Revolution.\n\nIt was the Revolution that gave Dawnclaw his first taste of war, and while he was too young to join the Reichsarmee or even assist in the fighting, he found himself so enamoured by the violence that when he finally finished his studies in 983, he chose to attend the Reich Militärakademie in Vinnin rather than be ordained as an Arcturian Priest.\n\nAfter graduating from Vinnin in 987, Ferdinand steadily rose through the ranks of the Reichsarmee, managing to attain the rank of Oberstleutnant in 1004 via a battlefield promotion in a skirmish at the Feathisian-Cloudsburian border - the murky circumstances of which many within the Imperial General Staff have found rather confusing.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Echo"

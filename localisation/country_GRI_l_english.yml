 ### Imperial Events ###
 imperial.0.t:0 "Under a Blue Sky"
 imperial.0.d:0 "Republicans to the North, Aquileia to the West, Wingbardy to the South, Ippasia to the East and the aristocracy in the court... Enemies on all sides. The glory of our empire was once unmatched, our might unchallenged, our authority unquestioned. Times have changed, however... our empire is now but a shadow of its former self. Nobles and revolutionaries alike have broken our empire apart, turned it into 'the dying bird of Griffonia', as they call it. Additionally, our beloved emperor has fallen ill, with his only heir remaining underage and incapable of ruling the empire. Due to this, various nobles and lowborn are wondering who is going to take charge of the empire during the regency. The future of the empire, weaker than ever, is uncertain..."
 imperial.0.a:0 "Dark times are ahead..."
 imperial.1.t:0 "A Train Trip"
 imperial.1.d:0 "Despite his deteriorating health, the emperor has decided to embark on a trip through the empire via train, in order to showcase the new imperial railway system and, more importantly, convince the people that his days are not yet over. Reluctantly, after heavily protesting against the trip and arguing that he should stay in bed, the emperor's doctors let him go."
 imperial.1.a:0 "What's the worst that could happen?"
 imperial.2.t:0 "A Perfectly Normal Day"
 imperial.2.d:0 "All seemed to have been going well in court today as the Emperor met noble after noble, listening to their petty complaints, pretending to be listening to their pleas while trying to not fall asleep... until the Emperor collapsed without warning. He was quickly rushed to his private chambers and is currently being taken care of by the Empire's finest medical experts."
 imperial.2.a:0 "His days might be over, at last..."
 imperial.3.t:0 "The Emperor is Dead"
 imperial.3.d:0 "Unfortunately, after nearly a month of treatments and therapy, Emperor Grover the Fifth of his name was embraced by the claws of Boreas at the young age of 54. Due to his only son and heir Prince Grover VI not being of the age in which he is capable of ruling the country himself, a Regency Council consisting of Nobles, Merchant Princes and Church Officials shall take over the apparatus of state until a more suitable solution is found..."
 imperial.3.a:0 "Boreas save us all!"
 imperial.4.t:0 "On the Matter of the Regency"
 imperial.4.d:0 "The first real issue the Regency Council is facing is who exactly it should allow into the council itself. The nobility, lead by Duchess Gabriela Eagleclaw, has proposed that only those of high birth should be able to attend and vote upon matters of importance in the Council, which would effectively exclude the majority of both merchant princes and the various church officials from voting. What no one was expecting, however, was the various religious organisations within our country uniting under the banner of Archon Eros VII of the Borean Temple, and declaring that the entire council should not only be able to vote, but that they should also open the doors to influential commoners."
 imperial.4.a:0 "Only the Highborn shall vote!"
 imperial.4.b:0 "Open our Doors to the Commoners!"
 imperial.5.t:0 "On the Matter Commoner Rights"
 imperial.5.d:0 "The Second issue we face is: how exactly should the average commoner be treated within the Empire? The nobility, pompous as ever, has stated that those who live upon their land are their property and shall remain as such. On the other claw, Archon Eros has proposed that we gradually give rights to all Griffons, lowborn or not."
 imperial.5.a:0 "Power to the Aristocracy!"
 imperial.5.b:0 "Power to the People!"
 imperial.6.t:0 "The Great Betrayal"
 imperial.6.d:0 "After nearly a month since we managed to secure the Regency Council's support for our cause it seemed as if things were finally calming down in the Capital after all these initial power struggles. Unfortunately, we were proven wrong, as today, during a council meeting, Duchess Gabriela Eagleclaw and several allies of her simply left the room, followed by the lords of Bronzehill, Feathisia and Greifenheim. Hours later, they all announced their formal secession from the Empire..."
 imperial.6.a:0 "Traitors! Every Single one of them!"
 imperial.7.t:0 "The Sad Truth"
 imperial.7.d:0 "The sad truth is that we simply cannot hope to fight against Eros on our own. If we intend to survive this mess we must convice our fellow lords to work together. Only then will we be strong enough to stand up to Eros."
 imperial.7.a:0 "Send out the messengers"
 imperial.7.b:0 "We can fight Griffonia on our own, thank you very much"
 imperial.8.t:0 "An Invitation"
 imperial.8.d:0 "It seems that the Duchess has once again called upon us to assist her. She believes that none of the secessionist states can hope to stand up against the Archon and his lackies alone, and that we are inclined to agree with her. Furthermore, she has proposed a formal alliance between our two nations."
 imperial.8.a:0 "We must work together"
 imperial.8.b:0 "We can take on the Archon on our own"
 imperial.9.t:0 "An Invitation"
 imperial.9.d:0 "It seems that the Duchess has once again called upon us to assist her.

 imperial.10.a:0 "We must work together"
 imperial.10.b:0 "We can take on the Archon on our own"

 imperial.13.d:0 "The Lord of Greifenheim has decided to join the Griffonian Protection Alliance."
 imperial.13.a:0 "Brilliant!"
 imperial.14.t:0 "An Offer"
 imperial.14.d:0 "It seems that after solidifying their position, the Council of Three has decided to end our autonomy without asking asking us or the Council for consent. While we could most likely veto this decision in the Regency Council and garner the support of what few of the nobility is left, chances are the Archons won't take no for an anwser. How do we respond?"
 imperial.14.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept (Taking this option will result in a game over)"
 imperial.14.b:0 "To Tartarus with the Archons! Let them come! (Taking this option will most likely result in injury)"
 imperial.15.t:0 "An Offer"
 imperial.15.d:0 "It seems that after solidifying their position, the Council of Three has decided to end our autonomy without asking asking us or the Council for consent.

 imperial.17.b:0 "To Tartarus with the Archons! Let them come! (Taking this option will most likely result in injury)"
 imperial.18.t:0 "Romau Refuses"
 imperial.18.d:0 "It seems that the Burghers and Lords of Romau have decided to defy us. Needless to say, they made the wrong choice."
 imperial.18.a:0 "Oh well, no one can say we weren't diplomatic"
 imperial.18.b:0 "Let them be, we don't need them"
 imperial.19.t:0 "Yaledom Defies Us"
 imperial.19.d:0 "Graf Mikusian, always the one for theatrics, has decided to deny our little request. It seems that Yaledom must rejoin the empire by force."
 imperial.19.a:0 "Teach them the price of defiance"
 imperial.19.b:0 "Yaledom is of no importance to our future plans"
 imperial.20.t:0 "Katerin Defiance"
 imperial.20.d:0 "The Prince of Katerin and his legion of glorified hillbillies have once again proven to be idiots, as they've decided to not rejoin the Empire. Perhaps it's about time we show them the might of the empire."
 imperial.20.a:0 "Let's crack some skulls!"
 imperial.20.b:0 "The Empire doesn't need them anyways"
 imperial.21.t:0 "The Obvious Suspect"
 imperial.21.d:0 "To no one's surprise, our former ally in the Regency Council, the Baron of Angriver, has decided to defy us. While this was an expected result, it certainly won't stop us from taking what is rightfully ours."
 imperial.21.a:0 "Time to deal with Angriver once and for all"
 imperial.21.b:0 "Let him rot in his little Barony for all I care"
 imperial.22.t:0 "The Empire Strikes Back"
 imperial.22.d:0 "After a series of reforms, miraculous victories and countless rebellions, the long suffering Griffonian Empire has, under the guidance of the Council of Three, managed to reclaim the Griffonian Heartlands. While many of the still independant Griffon Kingdoms were hoping that the three Archons would be satisfied with the realm they've carved out for themselves, it seems that this will not be the case, as today Archon Eros VII, with his young protégé Emperor Grover VI in tow, made a speech announcing that the Griffonian Empire shall not sit idle until all Griffons are united under the imperial banner once more"
 imperial.22.a:0 "A new Empire is on the rise..."
 imperial.23.t:0 "The Archon's Defiance"
 imperial.23.d:0 "After securing a victory for the Nobility in the Regency Council and alienating both the Eastern lords and the Archons, things were finally somewhat stabilising in the Imperial Capital. Until today that is. After a regular meeting, Archon Eros and Archon Proteus promptly denounced Duchess Gabriela and her allies as heathens and traitors, after which they both left the Capital. They were shortly afterwards joined by the Lord Protector of Romau, Duke of Yaledom, Baron of Angriver and the Prince of Katerin. Several hours after these events they all formally declared their secession from Griffonia..."
 imperial.23.a:0 "Curse you, Archons! Curse you!"
 imperial.24.t:0 "Facing the Facts"
 imperial.24.d:0 "We must face the facts. Gabriela and her lackies are too numerous and strong for us to tackle alone. We must unite with our fellow lords and fight the heathens to the West!"
 imperial.24.a:0 "Send out the invitations"
 imperial.24.b:0 "We'll fight the Duchess on our own!"
 imperial.25.t:0 "An Invitation"
 imperial.25.d:0 "It seems that the Baron of Angriver and the now exiled Archon Eros have once more called upon us to assist them. They tell us that none of the secessionist states can hope to stand against the Duchess and her lackies alone, and that we are inclined to agree with them. Furthermore, they have proposed a formal alliance between our two nations."
 imperial.25.a:0 "We must work together!"
 imperial.25.b:0 "We can take the Duchess on by ourselves!"
 imperial.26.t:0 "Romau Accepts"
 imperial.26.d:0 "The Free City of Romau has decided to accepted our proposal and join the Holy League."
 imperial.26.a:0 "Great!"
 imperial.27.t:0 "An Invitation"
 imperial.27.d:0 "It seems that the Baron of Angriver and the now exiled Archon Eros have once more called upon us to assist them. They tell us that none of the secessionist states can hope to stand against the Duchess and her lackies alone, and that we are inclined to agree with them. Furthermore, they have proposed a formal alliance between our two nations."

 imperial.28.a:0 "Splendid!"
 imperial.29.t:0 "An Invitation"
 imperial.29.d:0 "It seems that the Baron of Angriver and the now exiled Archon Eros have once more called upon us to assist them. They tell us that none of the secessionist states can hope to stand against the Duchess and her lackies alone, and that we are inclined to agree with them.

 imperial.30.t:0 "Katerin Accepts"
 imperial.30.d:0 "The Prince of Katerin has decided to accept our proposal and join the Holy League."
 imperial.30.a:0 "Fantastic!"
 imperial.31.t:0 "Joining the Empire?"
 imperial.31.d:0 "The Duchess, together with several other allies of nobility in the Council, has decided to end the autonomy of what territories the empire has left. This decision naturally also affects our lands. With our own Duchess as Regent of the Empire, should we accept and let Strawberry be integrated into the Empire?"
 imperial.31.a:0 "Our fate will be that of the Empire (This will result in complete annexation and game over)"
 imperial.31.b:0 "The Duchess has betrayed her own people! (The Duchess' brother will take over. The Empire will likely strike back)"
 imperial.32.t:0 "An Offer"
 imperial.32.d:0 "It seems that after solidifying their position, the Duchess has come to the conclusion that it would be best to end the autonomy of the Empire's territories and duchies. While we could most likely veto this outrageous decision in the Regency Council and garner the support of what few of the nobility doesn't support her, chances are Gabriela won't take no for an anwser. How do we respond?"
 imperial.32.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept (This option will result in a game over)"
 imperial.32.b:0 "To Tartarus with the Duchess! Let her come! (The Empire is unlikely to accept our decision)"
 imperial.33.t:0 "An Offer"
 imperial.33.d:0 "It seems that after solidifying their position, the Duchess has come to the conclusion that it would be best to end the autonomy of the Empire's territories and duchies. While we could most likely veto this outrageous decision in the Regency Council and garner the support of what few of the nobility doesn't support her, chances are Gabriela won't take no for an anwser. How do we respond?"
 imperial.33.a:0 "There is nothing we can do (This option will result in a game over)"
 imperial.33.b:0 "Never! Rally our troops! (The Empire is unlikely to accept our decision)"
 imperial.34.t:0 "An Offer"
 imperial.34.d:0 "It seems that after solidifying their position, the Duchess has come to the conclusion that it would be best to end the autonomy of the Empire's territories and duchies. While we could most likely veto this outrageous decision in the Regency Council and garner the support of what few of the nobility doesn't support her, chances are Gabriela won't take no for an anwser. How do we respond?"
 imperial.34.a:0 "It appears our time has come (This option will result in a game over)"
 imperial.34.b:0 "If she wants our land, she can come and get it! (The Empire is unlikely to accept our decision)"
 imperial.35.t:0 "Idiocy in Action"
 imperial.35.d:0 "We have just received word that the Duchess' brother Geralt has taken control over the Duchy of Strawberry. He has managed to rally the population against us, in defiance against our demand for integration."
 imperial.35.a:0 "Brother or not, he and the other traitors must pay!"
 imperial.35.b:0 "A foolish move... but we don't have time for family feuds, right now"
 imperial.36.t:0 "Feathisia Politely Refuses"
 imperial.36.d:0 "It seems that Duke Gerlach has somehow taken our demand to formally rejoin the Empire as something he can politely refuse. Additionally, he has 'politely' ended his country's vassalage and servitude to the Empire. What is our response?"
 imperial.36.a:0 "We politely declare war"
 imperial.36.b:0 "We politely step back"
 imperial.37.t:0 "Bronzehill Defies Us"
 imperial.37.d:0 "It appears the Count of Bronzehill has gone mad, considering he not only refused our request for integration but also insisted on no longer being our vassal."
 imperial.37.a:0 "Up the mountain we go"
 imperial.37.b:0 "There's plenty of other mountainous no bird's land to reclaim"
 imperial.38.t:0 "Greifenheim's Defiance"
 imperial.38.d:0 "The Duke of Greifenheim has decided to openly defy us and declared himself independent after we called for the integration of our vassals. Surely he is aware of the consequences?"
 imperial.38.a:0 "Let's teach this fool a lesson"
 imperial.38.b:0 "The Empire doesn't need them, anyways"
 imperial.39.t:0 "The Empire Strikes Back"
 imperial.39.d:0 "After a series of reforms, miraculous victories and countless rebellions, the long suffering Griffonian Empire has, under the guidance of the Nobility, managed to reclaim the Griffonian Heartlands. While many of the still independent Griffon Kingdoms were hoping that Duchess Gabriela and her noble allies would be satisfied with the realm they've carved out for themselves, it seems that this will not be case, as today the Duchess, with her young protégé Emperor Grover VI in tow, made a speech announcing that the Griffonian Empire shall not stop until all Griffons are united under it's banner once more."
 imperial.39.a:0 "It seems there is still hope for the Empire..."
 imperial.40.t:0 "The Fight against Illiteracy begins"
 imperial.40.d:0 "It appears our campaign against illiteracy is bearing some initial fruit, as middle and lower class citizens begin to read simple texts."
 imperial.40.a:0 "It's a start"
 imperial.41.t:0 "Improved literacy"
 imperial.41.d:0 "Our ongoing program against illiteracy is beginning to show its worth, as more and more children are being enlisted in schools. Not only this, but many adults are also now taking reading classes."
 imperial.41.a:0 "I'm sure those chicks will enjoy school lots"
 imperial.42.t:0 "Fighting Illiteracy"
 imperial.42.d:0 "Our war against illiteracy is now almost at an end, with illiteracy rates at an alltime low and most citizens having completed at least a basic level of education."
 imperial.42.a:0 "The war is nearly over"
 imperial.43.t:0 "Victory"
 imperial.43.d:0 "After many years of more or less forcing our people to educate themselves, we have finally managed to all but eradicate illiteracy within our nation. Our future shines just a little bit brighter."
 imperial.43.a:0 "Finally!"
 imperial.44.t:0 "The Coronation"
 imperial.44.d:0 "Today marks a wonderful day in the reconstituted Griffon Empire! This morning, rising with the dawning sun, Grover, sixth of his line, was crowned Emperor. Upon coming of age, the young chick is no longer that, but a proud member and glorious leader of the Grand Empire. The ceremony itself was a beautiful affair, with the Archonate Choir providing all the soundtrack necessary. Archon Eros the now former Lord Regent gave a short speech, calling forth visions of a wonderful and glorious future for the Empire. The crown was rested upon its rightful owner’s head, and the crowd present cheered for their new Emperor. Then, all were asked for silence, as Grover gave his speech. “Friends. Brothers and Sisters: We have finally returned our Holy Griffon Empire from the darkness of this Generation. And even still, our foes stand against us, ready to strike. But this matters not. With the gods on our side, none can stand against us, truly. From this day forward, we will march confidently towards our destiny; not one step back!”"
 imperial.44.a:0 "Long live the Emperor! Long live the Empire!"
 imperial.45.t:0 "The Coronation"
 imperial.45.d:0 "Today marks a new chapter in the history of the Griffonian Empire! On this bright and sunny morning, Grover VI, heir to the throne of the Empire, was crowned Emperor in full by the Lady Regent Duchess Gabriela. Following a short speech by the Regent, the Emperor himself took to the stage, and spoke of the Empire’s future prospects. “Friends… My people. Our past years, the years of my childhood, have been long and difficult. We have been made to fight - militarily, economically, and psychologically, against all odds and all those who would threaten our way of life. But today is not a day of war. Today is a day of success and peace, of victory and serenity. Today marks the end of our past, and the beginning of a bright future. The Empire has returned, and together, friends, we shall lead Griffonia into a new golden age. An age of peace and prosperity!"
 imperial.45.a:0 "Long Live the Emperor! Long live the Empire!"
 imperial.46.t:0 "Industrial Development"
 imperial.46.d:0 "The members of the IAC, despite not being capable of getting enough state funding to fullfil the production goals set for them by the Crown, have decided to use money out of their own pockets to fund the contstruction of several new factories around the Empire."
 imperial.46.a:0 "How nice of them"
 imperial.47.t:0 "Railroad Construction"
 imperial.47.d:0 "The IAC has recently decided to set aside a certain amount of their budget to construct several new railways to both connect the Empire and increase our industrial production."
 imperial.47.a:0 "More trains are good. I like trains."
 imperial.48.t:0 "Scandal Within the Palace"
 imperial.48.d:0 "The Noble Advisory Council, founded by the Imperial Regent, was created to both raise and advise the young Emperor Grover, as well as govern the nation while he matures. Certain members have been using their spots on the council to advance their social position or increase their own wealth. However, many of our citizens expect the nobility to be at least somewhat corrupt. Even still, it is hard to ignore, let alone tolerate an orgy within the imperial palace between multiple members of the council. The Press, naturally, had a field day. The local authorities and witnesses... not so much."
 imperial.48.a:0 "The Aristocracy!"
 imperial.49.t:0 "Noble Deeds"
 imperial.49.d:0 "As of recently, the Noble Advisory Council has been doing their job with an extra lack of corruption or indecency. While we don't know the reason for this change of policy, our citizens are satisfied with the current situation. For now."
 imperial.49.a:0 "That's new"
 imperial.50.t:0 "The Knights of Arcturus"
 imperial.50.d:0 "Ever since we gave both funding and support to the Knights of Arcturus, they have been working tirelessly to improve the nation in any way they can. This has manifested itself in many ways, from building schools to reparing temples and more recently building their own paramilitary orgnaizations. While these so called Squires are officially trainee knights they more or less fullfil the role of the Order's personal military police. This has increased support for the Imperial Regent and the Council of Three, but needless to say it has left some of our citizens slightly worried."
 imperial.50.a:0 "The innocent have nothing to fear"
 imperial.51.t:0 "Alms for the Poor"
 imperial.51.d:0 "Since State Eleos has been restored by the Archonate of Eyr, both the Archons and the few pious amongst the nobility have been working tirelessly on improving the lives of the common Griffon. These efforts have not gone unnoticed by our people, as support for the Council of Three and the Emperor is once more on the rise."
 imperial.51.a:0 "Great!"
 imperial.52.t:0 "The Ministry of Public Safety"
 imperial.52.d:0 "After the countless rebellions and revolutions that have happened over the past thirty years, it has become clear that the Empire's enemies do not come only from outside the Empire, but the inside as well. Despite the fact that the majority of our enemies are now firmly outside the country, ruling their own little fiefs, some officials and citizens are still worried about the idea of yet another bloody revolution. These individuals, headed by Ela Grimwing, have proposed that we create an organization that would seek to fight these radical elements that aim to destroy our Empire from within."
 imperial.52.a:0 "Having someone to look over our shoulder wouldn't hurt"
 imperial.52.b:0 "We can trust our people"
 imperial.53.t:0 "The Maréchal and the Emperor"
 imperial.53.d:0 "Leonard Rodier the infamous Maréchal and one of Aquileia's greatest generals has decided to come before us. It is no secret that Rodier decided to leave his homeland after the Second Revolution due to his belief of Aquileia failing as a nation, thus he has come before us to offer his services to our nation in the hopes that he might one day return to his beloved homeland and liberate it from the Republicans and Communists that have overrun it."
 imperial.53.a:0 "Welcome aboard, now please take a shower"
 imperial.53.b:0 "Go away Rodier, no one likes you"
 imperial.55.t:0 "Griffonia Demands Servitude"
 imperial.55.d:0 "Archon Eros, perhaps feeling emboldened by his more recent successes has decided to issue us an ultimatum... Serve the Empire or be destroyed, needless to say this ominous message has caused quite a stir within our entire country, but the question remains what shall we do?"
 imperial.55.a:0 "Let them come"
 imperial.55.b:0 "We can't hope to stand against them"
 imperial.56.t:0 "Skyfall Does not Bend"
 imperial.56.d:0 "Perhaps somewhat predictably the government of Skyfall has decided to not bow down before us, how shall we respond?"
 imperial.56.a:0 "How cute, they think they have a choice"
 imperial.56.b:0 "But, I like their whiskey..."
 imperial.57.t:0 "Skyfall Submits"
 imperial.57.d:0 "Unexpectedly the government of Skyfall has decided to submit to our demands, bringing the second largest city in Griffonia back under our control with not a drop of blood spilled."
 imperial.57.a:0 "Install a friendly government, and watch the money pile up"
 imperial.58.t:0 "The Fate of Aquileia"
 imperial.58.d:0 "After a grueling battle we have managed to finally defeat Aquileia, our biggest rival in Western Griffonia, however despite their defeat it seems that our issues in Aquileia are far from over. Marshal Rodier, perhaps emboldened by his role in helping defeat Aquileia has all but demanded that Aquileia become an autonomous region within our Empire, with himself at it's head. What shall we do?"
 imperial.58.a:0 "Let Rodier have his little playground"
 imperial.58.b:0 "You must be joking?"
 imperial.59.t:0 "The Aquileian Rebellion"
 imperial.59.d:0 "Betrayal! Marshal Rodier and his Aquileian brethren have risen up all across the former Kingdom and after kicking out our soldiers, declared an Aquileian State under the leadership of Rodier and his MPA lackies, it seems that our Aquileian troubles have only just begun."
 imperial.59.a:0 "I want the bastard's head on a spike"
 imperial.60.t:0 "Of Things That Never Happened"
 imperial.60.d:0 "An interesting book was published today, Of Things That Never Happened by Barys Solartail follows the life of a character simply known as Ropshin, a Republican terrorist who has been ordered by his superiors to assassinate a Wingbardian Noble. While the premise of the story is rather simple the writer focuses more on the character of Ropshin and his beliefs than the actual plot of the story, some critics have even pointed out that at times it feels as if the character and the writer are the same person. Nevertheless the book has been generally warmly received both by commoners and nobles alike."
 imperial.60.a:0 "Ropshin you say? Where have I heard that name before?"

The head of the Federation, spoke aloud over the radio, “We free peoples of the Skyfall Trade Federation shall never give in to this barbaric tyranny that the dying Griffon Empire is attempting to shackle upon us! We shall stand firm against any and all aggression from the empire, at any cost. And if they truly wish to seize our proud federation, then they may attempt to do so- but we shall bleed them dry, to the point that their mothers will weep both their husbands, sons, and grandsons. We shall never surrender!”"

After intense deliberation amongst their cabinet, they ultimately decided to agree to the Imperial terms. Shortly after the Federation's government was officially disolved, and the Province of Skyfall established under the watchful gaze of Volker Whitewing, a political activist and writer hailing from Grifftonia and one of the few Imperial loyalists from the now former Federation, needless to say he now enjoys a lot of hatered from his fellow citizens, but nevertheless message behind the new Governor's appointment is very clear... Skyfall belongs to the Empire."

 GRI_noble_rights_ensured:0 "The Rights of the Aristocracy"
 GRI_noble_rights_ensured_desc:0 "With our shrunken empire and the increased influence from the Archons, we must ensure that the nobility keeps their rightful place on top of the imperial food chain."
 GRI_noble_industry:0 "Foreign Ties"
 GRI_noble_industry_desc:0 "Many of our noble friends still have ties to foreign arms traders and entrepreneurs. We should use these ties to help build up our own economy."
 GRI_eagleclaw:0 "The Duchess"
 GRI_eagleclaw_desc:0 "Duchess Gabriela Eagleclaw of Strawberry, the late Emperor's cousin, is the only suitable choice for a regent. Glory to the Empire!"
 GRI_noble_council:0 "Establish the Imperial Advisory Council"
 GRI_noble_council_desc:0 "In an effort to centralise the power of the regent, Duchess Gabriela wishes to establish the Imperial Advisory Council. With this new council in place, only nobles loyal directly to the crown possess the right to vote on matters of importance."
 GRI_noble_industrial_council:0 "Establish the Industrial Advisory Council"
 GRI_noble_industrial_council_desc:0 "The creation of the Industrial Advisory Council was proposed by Ceron Greytalon, an influental industrialist and one of the the Duchess' closest friends. It would consist of the most influential and powerful entrepreneurs of the empire, who, as is the plan, would use their power to aid our own industrial efforts.    "
 GRI_noble_industrial:0 "Industrial Investments"
 GRI_noble_industrial_desc:0 "With the IAC in place, it would be a good idea to aid them by further investing in our growing industry."
 GRI_fix_bureaucracy_but_noble:0 "Matters of Bureaucracy"
 GRI_fix_bureaucracy_but_noble_desc:0 "A working bureaucracy is one of the most useful tools for administrating an empire. Unofortunately, ours seems to have become more of a hinderance than help. It's about time we clean up this place and get to work."
 GRI_unite_nobles:0 "Unite the Nation"

 GRI_PYT_uni:0 "Fund the Pythagorean Military Academy"
 GRI_PYT_uni_desc:0 "The Pythagorean Military Academy has been the favoured spot for the nobility to send their young ones if they are to receive at least a basic amount of education. Surely, if we threw some funds their way they could help us get rid of our educational woes."
 GRI_joint_armies:0 "Form the Griffonian Army"
 GRI_joint_armies_desc:0 "For a long time each and every petty noble and aristocrat has had their own private army. This was, supposedly, to protect their own estates, as well as the Empire as a whole. This system is no longer of use to us, however, and we must go with the times and establish our own, united armed forces, bound by the state and not the nobles."
 GRI_oligarhcy:0 "Feathisian Oligarchs"
 GRI_oligarhcy_desc:0 "It has become a bit of a public secret that Feathisia's industrial centers are under the control of a number of local oligarchs and technocrats, and while many of the nobility would very much like for us to get rid of them, it would prove far more useful for us to support these individuals and gather their support for our own cause."
 GRI_technocrats:0 "The Technocrats"
 GRI_technocrats_desc:0 "With the Feathisian oligarchy on our side, we should convince their friends within the technocracy to assist us, as well."

 GRI_empower_archons:0 "Power to the Three"
 GRI_empower_archons_desc:0 "We shall not allow the wretched nobles to rule the Empire any longer. The power must be taken away from the Regency Council and given to the Archons, for only the Archons can ensure the people's safety."
 GRI_fix_bureaucracy:0 "Deal With the Bureaucrats"
 GRI_fix_bureaucracy_desc:0 "Due to our fairly outdated and overcomplicated bureaucracy, things are going very slowly within our borders. It's time we simplify and update this process, for the good of the Empire."
 GRI_burgher_support:0 "Garner Support From the Burghers"
 GRI_burgher_support_desc:0 "Although not as powerful or influential as the merchants and traders within the Trade Federation to our west, the burgher class are still a viable ally to have. With their support, construction of additional factories would be much easier to fund."
 GRI_holy_order:0 "The Knights of Arcturus"
 GRI_holy_order_desc:0 "The Knights of Arcturus, founded in 357, are the militant branch of the Arcturian Archonate and have served the Empire faithfully for centuries. Seeing as how many of our people see them as legends, it may be a good idea to not only expand their ranks, but integrate them into our army."
 GRI_reward_loyalty:0 "Reward the Faithful"
 GRI_reward_loyalty_desc:0 "The time has come to unite those few lords who didn't side with Gabriela and her lackies. By force, if necessary."
 GRI_ROU_uni:0 "Fund the Romau University"
 GRI_ROU_uni_desc:0 "The University of Romau is one of the oldest universities in the entirety of the Griffon Empire and has been the stomping ground of many of the greatest minds in Griffonia's history. However, admission fees have become unbearable for most intellectuals, since the maintenance of this ancient institution is costly. Additional state funding would lower these fees, and surely then more griffons would attend, again."
 GRI_education_effort:0 "Literacy Campaign"
 GRI_education_effort_desc:0 "Without modernisation, our Empire will crumble. However, we can't hope to modernise without granting our people basic education. It will take some time, but it is time to start our literacy campaign."
 GRI_greenback_stuff:0 "Expand the Greenback Aluminium Smelters"
 GRI_greenback_stuff_desc:0 "A vital resource for aircraft production, Aluminium should be a high priority for us to secure. Fortunately, Greenback is already filled with much of it, and so we can easily expand our mining operations there."
 GRI_monasteries:0 "State Eleos"
 GRI_monasteries_desc:0 "Archon Erion XII, the chief of the Archonate of Eyr who, despite being a founding member of the Council of Three, has until recently been rather inactive in state matters, has proposed that we restore the concept of Imperial Eleos. Eleos, in essence, is the concept of providing for others as an act of virtue, and Erion reckons that restoring it on a national level would be a great way to garner more support from our populace."
 GRI_farms:0 "Protect our Farmers"
 GRI_farms_desc:0 "Despite serfdom being abolished nearly fifty years ago, many Griffonian farmers still worked as "indentured servants" on the lands of the nobilty. However, with the power of the nobility now broken, we should ensure that such a thing never happens again and provide some basic funding for all of Griffonia's farmers."
 GRI_romau_proclimation:0 "The Romau Proclamation"
 GRI_romau_proclimation_desc:0 "The Time has come to end Duchess Gabriela and her lackies. These traitors and rebels will hang for their crimes!"
 GRI_invite_erion:0 "Eyr's Chosen"
 GRI_invite_erion_desc:0 "Out of the Council of Three, the only one to not flee for Angriver was Archon Erion XII. While both Eros and Proteus are militant in their own right, Erion on the other claw seems to only want to help the Griffonian people, which has secured him quite a lot of support from the commoners. Perhaps we should invite him into the government?"
 GRI_crush_FEA:0 "Crush the Feathisian Resistance"
 GRI_crush_FEA_desc:0 "Powerful Oligarchs and Technochrats within Feathisia are contesting our influence over the newly reclaimed region. We must take care of them and ensure the people's loyalty to us and us alone."
 GRI_crush_STW:0 "Integrate the Strawberry Dutchy"
 GRI_crush_STW_desc:0 "The Duchy of Strawberry was the main stronghold of Duchess Eagleclaw, and many still see our occupation as unlawful. To prevent unrest and rebellion, we must crack down on seperatism."
 GRI_end_TRD:0 "Under a Clear Sky"
 GRI_end_TRD_desc:0 "Ever since the collapse of the Empire, the Skyfall Federation has controlled some of the most prosperous Griffonia ports and cities, but also managed to take our navy with it. If we intend to restore the Empire to its full glory, we must reclaim what is ours and destroy these traitors!"
 GRI_empire_rising:0 "The Rising Empire"
 GRI_empire_rising_desc:0 "Under the guidance of the Archons, we have managed to restore some of the Empire's former glory. However, our path does not end here. There is still much to be done..."
 GRI_strike_north:0 "Reclaim the North"
 GRI_strike_north_desc:0 "The North must be reclaimed. The Socialists, together with the false and treacherous Griffonian Republic, must be wiped off the map, at once!"
 GRI_strike_lakes:0 "Reclaim Central Griffonia"
 GRI_strike_lakes_desc:0 "Central Griffonia houses Griffinstone, one of the greatest monuments to Griffonkind. It must be reclaimed in the name of the Empire!"
 GRI_strike_west:0 "Deal With the Despots of Aquileia"
 GRI_strike_west_desc:0 "Western Griffonia is home to not only treacherous duchies, as well as the trade federation, but also the Aquileia. To secure the future of our empire, we must rid ourselves of the Discret family and its vassals!"
 GRI_strike_south:0 "A Lesson in Humility"
 GRI_strike_south_desc:0 "The Fall and division of our Empire started by the claws of Wingbardy. And now, with most lands safely back in our realm, it is time to end this menace, once and for all. Let us teach those fools a lesson in humility!"
 GRI_industry_technology:0 "Modern Industrial Methods"
 GRI_industry_technology_desc:0 "Industrial modernisation has only just begun, and our country is working hard to improve its situation. We should invite foreign experts to teach us only the best and most modern industrial methods."
 GRI_romau_roads:0 "Build up Romau"
 GRI_romau_roads_desc:0 "With Romau and it's already formidable industrial base now in our claws, we should begin expanding upon both their infrastructure and industry."
 GRI_romau_arms:0 "Expand the Romau Arsenal"
 GRI_romau_arms_desc:0 "The Romau Arsenal is one of the most impressive arsenals in all of Griffonia. We should continue expanding it, even further."
 GRI_greenback_roads:0 "Begin Industrializing Yaledom"
 GRI_greenback_roads_desc:0 "Yaledom, while not as industrialzed as Romau, holds much potential, as it is the home of Greenback, one of Griffonia's larger cities. Perhaps we should focus on building up Yaledom and Angriver?"
 GRI_oil:0 "The Feathisian Oil Fields"
 GRI_oil_desc:0 "After some surveying by several qualified experts, we have received reports that oil has, indeed, been found within Feathera. We should waste no time and construct oil wells within that region. This vital resource will aid us well."
 GRI_greenback_industry:0 "Invest in Greenback"
 GRI_greenback_industry_desc:0 "Greenback is one of the fastest growing cities in Griffonia, thus being one of the few cities left actually worth investing in. We should not let this opportunity slip trough our claws."
 GRI_east_center:0 "The Fires of the East"
 GRI_east_center_desc:0 "Trough careful investing and industrial planning, we've created a thriving industrial center around Greenback and Angriver. Now it's time to reap the benefits."
 GRI_imperial_roads:0 "Repair the Imperial Road System"
 GRI_imperial_roads_desc:0 "The imperial road system is in a bad shape, making it hard for us to transport troops, goods or even just civilians from one side of the empire to the other. If we are to modernise properly, this must change."
 GRI_feathesia_roads:0 "Feathisian Railroads"
 GRI_feathesia_roads_desc:0 "Feathisia is one of the larger and more populated provinces of the old Empire. Unfortunately, due to the relatively rural nature of the population, they have been unable to exploit their lucrative position. In an effort to fix this, we should fund the construction of new roads connecting the various scattered townships of Feathisia."
 GRI_feathesia_dock:0 "Naval Build Up"
 GRI_feathesia_dock_desc:0 "The ominously named Coast of Decay was once the greatest fear of any Griffonian sailor, due to the rumors of it being inhabited by various nasty creatures such as Krakens and the Naga, who are supposedly responsible for hundreds of sailors going missing in the area. However, we live in much more enlightened times now and know that these rumours hold no real value. It's about time we start construction on a port."
 GRI_feathisia_industry:0 "Industrialize Feathisia"
 GRI_feathisia_industry_desc:0 "With the Feathisian populace connected via roads and railroads, we can now begin constructing new industrial centers in the region."
 GRI_strawberry_roads:0 "Strawberry Railroads"
 GRI_strawberry_roads_desc:0 "Although the city of Redwater within the state of Strawberry is one of the more industrialised cities of the Empire, the remaining provinces are still largely unconnected backwaters. It's time we construct railways to connect the people of Strawberry."
 GRI_strawberry_arms:0 "Invest in the Redwater Arms Company"
 GRI_strawberry_arms_desc:0 "The Redwater Arms Company is one of the most renowned Griffonian firearm workshops, though they only provide arms to nobility. If we were to provide them with ample funding and some tax cuts, we might be able to convince them to provide supplies to our new army."
 GRI_west_center:0 "The Industry of the West"
 GRI_west_center_desc:0 "With a bit of luck and some proper investment, we are now in the position to kickstart an arms industry around Feathisia and Redwater."
 GRI_central_industry:0 "Industrialze the Countryside"
 GRI_central_industry_desc:0 "While the Imperial Capital is one of the largest industrial centers in Griffonia, the area surrounding it could use some improvement. We should set aside some funds to construct additional factories in the area."
 GRI_modern_industry:0 "Modern Industry"
 GRI_modern_industry_desc:0 "We have nearly managed to modernize our industrial sector fully. All that we require now is one small, final push."
 GRI_trade_dock:0 "Repair the Skyfall Naval District"
 GRI_trade_dock_desc:0 "Skyfall is the largest trade port in Griffonia and thus one of its richest cities. We should capitalize on this and rebuild and improve the old Skyfall naval district."
 GRI_miracle:0 "The Imperial Economic Miracle"
 GRI_miracle_desc:0 "Through our ingenious economic policies, we have managed to enter an age of economcy prosperity unimaginable just a few years ago. Truly Griffonia is rising once more!"
 GRI_crona_industry:0 "Fund the Imperial Arms Company"
 GRI_crona_industry_desc:0 "The not so creatively named Imperial Arms Company has since time immemorial produced most of the military equipment necessary to arm the Imperial Army. We should provide them with more funding now that our economic situation is at least relatively secure."
 GRI_new_navy:0 "Restore the Imperial Admirality"
 GRI_new_navy_desc:0 "After such a long time we have finally returned to the sea, and it is glorious! However, now is not the time for mucking about. There is still much to be done, but first we must restore the Imperial Griffonian Admirality."
 GRI_cat_base_strike_f:0 "Promote Admiral Raincrest to Grand Admiral"
 GRI_cat_base_strike_f_desc:0 "Admiral Raincrest has some interesting ideas in regards to our newly reorganized navy, after having spent a vacation across the “pond” as it were. Perhaps this new forward thinking should be made our main Naval focus?"
 GRI_carriers:0 "Floating Strongholds"
 GRI_carriers_desc:0 "We should build mobile, floating strongholds that our fighters can comfortably sortie from. These, and not some big, lumbering frigates, are our Naval future."
 GRI_navy_planes:0 "Naval Aviation"
 GRI_navy_planes_desc:0 "Our new “carrier” boats require new fighter planes to go with them. We should focus on developing specialized planes specifically for our carriers."
 GRI_cat_fleet_in_being_f:0 "Promote Admiral Hellcrest to Grand Admiral"
 GRI_cat_fleet_in_being_f_desc:0 "Admiral Hellcrest is a respected sailor from the glory days of nautical warfare, and has strong opinions on how war upon the open sea should be fought. Perhaps he can rebuild our navy into the grand fleet it used to be?"
 GRI_battleship:0 "Back to the Classics"
 GRI_battleship_desc:0 "Why change what isn't broken? We need new, bigger, better, more powerful ships. And we have the means to develop them. Now is a perfect time to do so."
 GRI_cruisers:0 "The Modern Trireme"
 GRI_cruisers_desc:0 "As much as our ships of old were excellent and well built, we must continue to keep up with the changing world around us. It is time to update our lighter ships into something more modern."
 GRI_naval_base:0 "A Proper Home to Call Our Own"
 GRI_naval_base_desc:0 "Our new navy is growing at a rapid rate, but we must find somewhere this navy can call it’s home; somewhere safe where they can repair and relax between journeys seaward, and prepare for the next mission."
 GRI_big_fleet_for_you:0 "Fly the Imperial Flag"
 GRI_big_fleet_for_you_desc:0 "The Grand Navy of the Empire has returned, and it's stronger than ever. Raise the flag high, men! To victory!"
 GRI_cat_trade_interdiction_f:0 "Promote Admiral Stormfeather to Grand Admiral"
 GRI_cat_trade_interdiction_f_desc:0 "A curious griffon who we nearly lost to Nova Griffonia when the empire split apart, Stormfeather is a proponent of what he calls “U-boats”, and believes that our way forward is to convert our surface fleet to a new, modern, trade hunting fleet. Perhaps this is a good way forward?"
 GRI_submarines:0 "Silent Hunters"
 GRI_submarines_desc:0 "You can't hit what you can't see. At least, that's our theory. It's time to make good use of that theory and develop our own under-water craft, and the Griffons needed to crew them."
 GRI_destroyers:0 "The Modern Privateers"
 GRI_destroyers_desc:0 "An old tradition from days of wooden sailing vessels, Privateering is taking on a new face, with the invention and development of more modern vessels leading to more brash and aggressive new captains. We should reward these captains with new vessels more akin to their preferred specifications."
 GRI_amphibious:0 "Land and Sea"
 GRI_amphibious_desc:0 "The War at Sea is one thing, but winning the war on land should always stay our main priority. Thus, we must develop new tools and craft to aid our troops. Our troops will fight anyone; no matter how far away or how well protected they might be."
 GRI_raiding:0 "Unrestricted Naval Warfare"
 GRI_raiding_desc:0 "There is no time to determine whether a vessel is a threat or whether it's boarding civilians. We have declared these oceans our waters, and if they are unwilling to respect that in a time of war, the guilt is on their own claws."
 GRI_army:0 "Begin Reforming the Imperial Army"
 GRI_army_desc:0 "Our army is in a sad state of affairs. The time has come to begin reforming it into a proper Imperial Military wing that anygriff can be proud to be a part of."
 GRI_infantry_equipment_f:0 "Shinier Guns"
 GRI_infantry_equipment_f_desc:0 "Our muskets of old are getting to the point of uselessness due to modern military doctrines. If we have any hope to keep up with our neighbors, we must modernize. New, shinier, and more importantly, deadlier guns are in order."
 GRI_support_equipment_f:0 "Clean Bandages"
 GRI_support_equipment_f_desc:0 "We need to reconsider our stance on how we treat our wounded. Quite frankly, our “battlefield doctors” are terrible, and this is getting more Griffons killed out of battle than in battle. We urgently need to fix this problem."
 GRI_artillery_f:0 "Bigger Guns"
 GRI_artillery_f_desc:0 "Not only do we need better guns, but larger guns as well. The age of cannons has passed, and the thunder of artillery will make our enemy tremble before us."
 GRI_light_tank_f:0 "Armored Tractors"
 GRI_light_tank_f_desc:0 "A couple enterprising Griffons have approached us with the idea to slap armored plates onto a tractor, like a large piece of armor plating. While this particular model doesn't pose much of a threat, perhaps such a new type of vehicle could be of good use?"
 GRI_doctrine_grand_battlepan:0 "Bronzetail's Ball Busting Fortresses"
 GRI_doctrine_grand_battlepan_desc:0 "Bronzetail believes that we should make our defensive positions so unassailable that the enemy either does not go forward, or does so with unacceptable casualties. Perhaps this is the military focus we should follow, his patent pending name aside."
 GRI_support_equipment_f_but_better:0 "Support Squads"
 GRI_support_equipment_f_but_better_desc:0 "Building on our new military reorganization, it is time to develop specialized support squads, capable of aiding our frontline soldiers. Thus, our soldiers will spent more time shooting at the enemy instead of taking care of supplies, wounds, or whatever else it might be."
 GRI_enigma_code:0 "The Engima Code"
 GRI_enigma_code_desc:0 "A brilliant piece of military engineering, developed by an electronics engineer named Edward Nigma, E. Nigma’s code is a modern and supposedly impossible to break secret message code, that we should focus on spreading and implementing in our military as fast as possible."
 GRI_magic_weapons:0 "Weapons of the New Age"
 GRI_magic_weapons_desc:0 "After hearing of magical weapon experiments from across the ocean, now is the time to make our own attempts at producing them. The future is now."
 GRI_doctrine_superior_firepower:0 "August's Fire and Brimstone"
 GRI_doctrine_superior_firepower_desc:0 "The more the merrier. August believes we should focus on massing as much firepower as possible, as often as possible, so as to break our enemies as quickly as possible, with as little loss of our own lives as we can. Perhaps we should make this our main military focus."
 GRI_infantry_equipment_f_but_better:0 "Modern Firearms"
 GRI_infantry_equipment_f_but_better_desc:0 "While our old weapons have served us well in the past, it's time to catch up to the world. These new rifles are a far cry from our old muskets and bayonets, and will take some time to learn to use properly, but the updated designs are highly important in keeping us on the edge of technology."
 GRI_motorized:0 "Armoured Cars and Trucks"
 GRI_motorized_desc:0 "With our successful tractor experiments, we have decided that it would be a good idea to put armor on our cars and trucks as well, to give them a similar role in battle, and to continue modernizing our force."
 GRI_artillery_f_but_better:0 "Mass Artillery Bombardment"
 GRI_artillery_f_but_better_desc:0 "Using massive amounts of Artillery, we can destroy enemy formations, as well as morale. When our troops finally close on the enemy, they will surely rout sooner than later."
 GRI_mobile_warfare_focus:0 "Thundertail's Shock and Awe"
 GRI_mobile_warfare_focus_desc:0 "Thundertail believes that the way to win our wars is to attack as fast as possible, with as much power as we can without sacrificing our rapid advance. Thus, we overtake our enemies before they are able to realize we’re right on top of them. Perhaps we should make this our main military focus?"
 GRI_light_tank_fs:0 "Proper Tanks"
 GRI_light_tank_fs_desc:0 "With the success of our tractor experiments, it is time to fully develop the “tank”, as it's being called, and turn it into a proper weapon of war, rather than a hodgepodged prototype. Standardization and upgraded designs are in order, as soon as possible."
 GRI_medium_tank:0 "Heavier Tanks"
 GRI_medium_tank_desc:0 "While our proper modern tanks are good and well, we should make attempts at heavier, more armored and powerful designs."
 GRI_heavy_tank:0 "Moving Forts"
 GRI_heavy_tank_desc:0 "Our Heavy tank concepts are good enough to begin producing, but we should aim to build truly mobile fortresses of armor, nigh-impenetrable by our enemy’s weapons."
 GRI_military_academy:0 "The Imperial Military Academy"
 GRI_military_academy_desc:0 "Our Military has come a long way from its humble beginnings. And yet, there is so much more that it can learn and improve upon. It is time to open up and fund an academy dedicated to training the next generation’s bright, young military minds. Who knows what the future holds?"
 GRI_airforce:0 "The New Griffonian Airforce"
 GRI_airforce_desc:0 "The time has come to finally expand the Griffonian Air Force."
 GRI_airbase:0 "Expand the Imperial Airports"

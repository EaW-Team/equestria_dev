 ### Imperial Events ###
 imperial.1.t:0 "A Train Trip"
 imperial.1.d:0 "Despite his deteriorating health, the emperor has decided to embark on a trip through the empire via train, in order to showcase the new imperial railway system and, more importantly, convince the people that his days are not yet over. Reluctantly, after heavily protesting against the trip and arguing that he should stay in bed, the emperor's doctors let him go."
 imperial.1.a:0 "What's the worst that could happen?"
 imperial.2.t:0 "A Perfectly Normal Day"
 imperial.2.d:0 "All seemed to have been going well in court today as the Emperor met noble after noble, listening to their petty complaints, pretending to be listening to their pleas while trying to not fall asleep... until the Emperor collapsed without warning. He was quickly rushed to his private chambers and is currently being taken care of by the Empire's finest medical experts."
 imperial.2.a:0 "His days might be over, at last..."
 imperial.3.t:0 "The Emperor is Dead"
 imperial.3.d:0 "Unfortunately, after nearly a month of treatments and therapy, Emperor Grover the Fifth of his name was embraced by the claws of Boreas at the young age of 54. Due to his only son and heir Prince Grover VI not being of the age in which he is capable of ruling the country himself, a Regency Council consisting of Nobles, Merchant Princes and Church Officials shall take over the apparatus of state until a more suitable solution is found..."
 imperial.3.a:0 "Boreas save us all!"
 imperial.4.t:0 "On the Matter of the Regency"
 imperial.4.d:0 "The first real issue the Regency Council is facing is who exactly it should allow into the council itself. The nobility, lead by Duchess Gabriela Eagleclaw, has proposed that only those of high birth should be able to attend and vote upon matters of importance in the Council, which would effectively exclude the majority of both merchant princes and the various church officials from voting. What no one was expecting, however, was the various religious organisations within our country uniting under the banner of Archon Eros VII of the Borean Temple, and declaring that the entire council should not only be able to vote, but that they should also open the doors to influential commoners."
 imperial.4.a:0 "Only the Highborn shall vote!"
 imperial.4.b:0 "Open our Doors to the Commoners!"
 imperial.5.t:0 "On the Matter Commoner Rights"
 imperial.5.d:0 "The Second issue we face is: how exactly should the average commoner be treated within the Empire? The nobility, pompous as ever, has stated that those who live upon their land are their property and shall remain as such. On the other claw, Archon Eros has proposed that we gradually give rights to all griffons, lowborn or not."
 imperial.5.a:0 "Power to the Aristocracy!"
 imperial.5.b:0 "Power to the People!"
 imperial.6.t:0 "The Great Betrayal"
 imperial.6.d:0 "After nearly a month since we managed to secure the Regency Council's support for our cause it seemed as if things were finally calming down in the Capital after all these initial power struggles. Unfortunately, we were proven wrong, as today, during a council meeting, Duchess Gabriela Eagleclaw and several allies of her simply left the room, followed by the lords of Bronzehill, Feathisia and Greifenheim. Hours later, they all announced their formal secession from the Empire..."
 imperial.6.a:0 "Traitors! Every Single one of them!"
 imperial.7.t:0 "The Sad Truth"
 imperial.7.d:0 "The sad truth is that we simply cannot hope to fight against Eros on our own. If we intend to survive this mess we must convince our fellow lords to work together. Only then will we be strong enough to stand up to Eros."
 imperial.7.a:0 "Send out the messengers."
 imperial.7.b:0 "We can fight Griffonia on our own, thank you very much."
 imperial.8.t:0 "An Invitation"
 imperial.8.d:0 "It seems that the Duchess has once again called upon us to assist her. She believes that none of the secessionist states can hope to stand up against the Archon and his lackeys alone, and that we are inclined to agree with her. Furthermore, she has proposed a formal alliance between our two nations."
 imperial.8.a:0 "We must work together."
 imperial.8.b:0 "We can take on the Archon on our own."
 imperial.9.t:0 "An Invitation"
 imperial.9.d:0 "It seems that the Duchess has once again called upon us to assist her. She believes that none of the secessionist states can hope to stand up against the Archon and his lackeys alone, and that we are inclined to agree with her. Furthermore, she has proposed a formal alliance between our two nations."
 imperial.9.a:0 "We must work together."
 imperial.9.b:0 "We can take on the Archon on our own."
 imperial.10.t:0 "An Invitation"
 imperial.10.d:0 "It seems that the Duchess has once again called upon us to assist her. She believes that none of the secessionist states can hope to stand up against the Archon and his lackeys alone, and that we are inclined to agree with her. Furthermore, she has proposed a formal alliance between our two nations."
 imperial.10.a:0 "We must work together."
 imperial.10.b:0 "We can take on the Archon on our own."
 imperial.11.t:0 "Bronzehill Accepts"
 imperial.11.d:0 "The Lord of Bronzehill has decided to join the Griffonian Protection Alliance."
 imperial.11.a:0 "Great!"
 imperial.12.t:0 "Feathisia Accepts"
 imperial.12.d:0 "The Lord of Feathisia has decided to join the Griffonian Protection Alliance."
 imperial.12.a:0 "Fantastic!"
 imperial.13.t:0 "Greifenheim Accepts"
 imperial.13.d:0 "The Lord of Greifenheim has decided to join the Griffonian Protection Alliance."
 imperial.13.a:0 "Brilliant!"
 imperial.14.t:0 "An Offer"
 imperial.14.d:0 "It seems that after solidifying their position, the Council of Three has decided to end our autonomy without asking asking us or the Council for consent. While we could most likely veto this decision in the Regency Council and garner the support of what few of the nobility is left, chances are the Archons won't take no for an answer. How do we respond?"
 imperial.14.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept."
 imperial.14.b:0 "To Tartarus with the Archons! Let them come!"
 imperial.14.c:0 "We've got the situation under control."
 imperial.15.t:0 "An Offer"
 imperial.15.d:0 "It seems that after solidifying their position, the Council of Three has decided to end our autonomy without asking asking us or the Council for consent. While we could most likely veto this decision in the Regency Council and garner the support of what few of the nobility is left, chances are the Archons won't take no for an answer. How do we respond?"
 imperial.15.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept."
 imperial.15.b:0 "To Tartarus with the Archons! Let them come!"
 imperial.16.t:0 "An Offer"
 imperial.16.d:0 "It seems that after solidifying their position, the Council of Three has decided to end our autonomy without asking asking us or the Council for consent. While we could most likely veto this decision in the Regency Council and garner the support of what few of the nobility is left, chances are the Archons won't take no for an answer. How do we respond?"
 imperial.16.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept."
 imperial.16.b:0 "To Tartarus with the Archons! Let them come!"
 imperial.17.t:0 "An Offer"
 imperial.17.d:0 "It seems that after solidifying their position, the Council of Three has decided to end our autonomy without asking asking us or the Council for consent.

How do we respond?"
 imperial.17.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept."
 imperial.17.b:0 "To Tartarus with the Archons! Let them come!"
 imperial.18.t:0 "Romau Refuses"
 imperial.18.d:0 "It seems that the Burghers and Lords of Romau have decided to defy us. Needless to say, they made the wrong choice."
 imperial.18.a:0 "Oh well, no one can say we weren't diplomatic."
 imperial.18.b:0 "Let them be, we don't need them."
 imperial.19.t:0 "Yaledom Defies Us"
 imperial.19.d:0 "Graf Mikusian, always the one for theatrics, has decided to deny our little request. It seems that Yaledom must rejoin the empire by force."
 imperial.19.a:0 "Teach them the price of defiance!"
 imperial.19.b:0 "Yaledom is of no importance to our future plans."
 imperial.20.t:0 "Katerin Defiance"
 imperial.20.d:0 "The Prince of Katerin and his legion of glorified hillbillies have once again proven to be idiots, as they've decided to not rejoin the Empire. Perhaps it's about time we show them the might of the empire."
 imperial.20.a:0 "Let's crack some skulls!"
 imperial.20.b:0 "The Empire doesn't need them anyways."
 imperial.21.t:0 "The Obvious Suspect"
 imperial.21.d:0 "To no one's surprise, our former ally in the Regency Council, the Baron of Angriver, has decided to defy us. While this was an expected result, it certainly won't stop us from taking what is rightfully ours."
 imperial.21.a:0 "Time to deal with Angriver once and for all!"
 imperial.21.b:0 "Let him rot in his little Barony for all I care!"
 imperial.22.t:0 "The Empire Strikes Back"
 imperial.22.d:0 "After a series of reforms, miraculous victories and countless rebellions, the long suffering Griffonian Empire has, under the guidance of the Council of Three, managed to reclaim the Griffonian Heartlands. While many of the still independent Griffon Kingdoms were hoping that the three Archons would be satisfied with the realm they've carved out for themselves, it seems that this will not be the case, as today Archon Eros VII, with his young protege Emperor Grover VI in tow, made a speech announcing that the Griffonian Empire shall not sit idle until all griffons are united under the Imperial banner once more."
 imperial.22.a:0 "A new Empire is on the rise..."
 imperial.23.t:0 "The Archon's Defiance"
 imperial.23.d:0 "After securing a victory for the Nobility in the Regency Council and alienating both the Eastern lords and the Archons, things were finally somewhat stabilising in the Imperial Capital. Until today that is. After a regular meeting, Archon Eros and Archon Proteus promptly denounced Duchess Gabriela and her allies as heathens and traitors, after which they both left the Capital. They were shortly afterwards joined by the Lord Protector of Romau, Duke of Yaledom, Baron of Angriver and the Prince of Katerin. Several hours after these events they all formally declared their secession from Griffonia..."
 imperial.23.a:0 "Curse you, Archons! Curse you!"
 imperial.24.t:0 "Facing the Facts"
 imperial.24.d:0 "We must face the facts. Gabriela and her lackeys are too numerous and strong for us to tackle alone. We must unite with our fellow lords and fight the heathens to the West!"
 imperial.24.a:0 "Send out the invitations."
 imperial.24.b:0 "We'll fight the Duchess on our own!"
 imperial.25.t:0 "An Invitation"
 imperial.25.d:0 "It seems that the Baron of Angriver and the now exiled Archon Eros have once more called upon us to assist them. They tell us that none of the secessionist states can hope to stand against the Duchess and her lackeys alone, and that we are inclined to agree with them. Furthermore, they have proposed a formal alliance between our two nations."
 imperial.25.a:0 "We must work together!"
 imperial.25.b:0 "We can take the Duchess on by ourselves!"
 imperial.26.t:0 "Romau Accepts"
 imperial.26.d:0 "The Free City of Romau has decided to accept our proposal and join the Holy League."
 imperial.26.a:0 "Great!"
 imperial.27.t:0 "An Invitation"
 imperial.27.d:0 "It seems that the Baron of Angriver and the now exiled Archon Eros have once more called upon us to assist them. They tell us that none of the secessionist states can hope to stand against the Duchess and her lackeys alone, and that we are inclined to agree with them. Furthermore, they have proposed a formal alliance between our two nations."
 imperial.27.a:0 "We must work together!"
 imperial.27.b:0 "We can take the Duchess on by ourselves!"
 imperial.28.t:0 "Yaledom Accepts"
 imperial.28.d:0 "The Duke of Yaledom has decided to accept our proposal and join the Holy League."
 imperial.28.a:0 "Splendid!"
 imperial.29.t:0 "An Invitation"
 imperial.29.d:0 "It seems that the Baron of Angriver and the now exiled Archon Eros have once more called upon us to assist them. They tell us that none of the secessionist states can hope to stand against the Duchess and her lackeys alone, and that we are inclined to agree with them. Furthermore, they have proposed a formal alliance between our two nations."
 imperial.29.a:0 "We must work together!"
 imperial.29.b:0 "We can take the Duchess on by ourselves!"
 imperial.30.t:0 "Katerin Accepts"
 imperial.30.d:0 "The Prince of Katerin has decided to accept our proposal and join the Holy League."
 imperial.30.a:0 "Fantastic!"
 imperial.31.t:0 "Joining the Empire?"
 imperial.31.d:0 "The Duchess, together with several other allies of nobility in the Council, has decided to end the autonomy of what territories the empire has left. This decision naturally also affects our lands. With our own Duchess as Regent of the Empire, should we accept and let Strawberry be integrated into the Empire?"
 imperial.31.a:0 "Our fate will be that of the Empire."
 imperial.31.b:0 "The Duchess has betrayed her own people!"
 imperial.32.t:0 "An Offer"
 imperial.32.d:0 "It seems that after solidifying their position, the Duchess has come to the conclusion that it would be best to end the autonomy of the Empire's territories and duchies. While we could most likely veto this outrageous decision in the Regency Council and garner the support of what few of the nobility doesn't support her, chances are Gabriela won't take no for an answer. How do we respond?"
 imperial.32.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept."
 imperial.32.b:0 "To Tartarus with the Duchess! Let her come!"
 imperial.33.t:0 "An Offer"
 imperial.33.d:0 "It seems that after solidifying their position, the Duchess has come to the conclusion that it would be best to end the autonomy of the Empire's territories and duchies. While we could most likely veto this outrageous decision in the Regency Council and garner the support of what few of the nobility doesn't support her, chances are Gabriela won't take no for an answer. How do we respond?"
 imperial.33.a:0 "There is nothing we can do..."
 imperial.33.b:0 "Never! Rally our troops!"
 imperial.34.t:0 "An Offer"
 imperial.34.d:0 "It seems that after solidifying their position, the Duchess has come to the conclusion that it would be best to end the autonomy of the Empire's territories and duchies. While we could most likely veto this outrageous decision in the Regency Council and garner the support of what few of the nobility doesn't support her, chances are Gabriela won't take no for an answer. How do we respond?"
 imperial.34.a:0 "It appears our time has come."
 imperial.34.b:0 "If she wants our land, she can come and take it!"
 imperial.35.t:0 "Idiocy in Action"
 imperial.35.d:0 "We have just received word that [From.GetLeader] has taken control over the Duchy of Strawberry. He has managed to rally the population against us, in defiance against our demand for integration."
 imperial.35.a:0 "He and the other traitors must pay!"
 imperial.35.b:0 "A foolish move... but we don't have time for family feuds, right now."
 imperial.36.t:0 "Feathisia Politely Refuses"
 imperial.36.d:0 "It seems that Duke Gerlach has somehow taken our demand to formally rejoin the Empire as something he can politely refuse. Additionally, he has 'politely' ended his country's vassalage and servitude to the Empire. What is our response?"
 imperial.36.a:0 "We politely declare war."
 imperial.36.b:0 "We politely step back."
 imperial.37.t:0 "Bronzehill Defies Us"
 imperial.37.d:0 "It appears the Count of Bronzehill has gone mad, considering he not only refused our request for integration but also insisted on no longer being our vassal."
 imperial.37.a:0 "Up the mountain we go..."
 imperial.37.b:0 "There's plenty of other mountainous no bird's land to reclaim."
 imperial.38.t:0 "Greifenheim's Defiance"
 imperial.38.d:0 "The Duke of Greifenheim has decided to openly defy us and declared himself independent after we called for the integration of our vassals. Surely he is aware of the consequences?"
 imperial.38.a:0 "Let's teach this fool a lesson!"
 imperial.38.b:0 "The Empire doesn't need them, anyways."
 imperial.39.t:0 "The Empire Strikes Back"
 imperial.39.d:0 "After a series of reforms, miraculous victories and countless rebellions, the long suffering Griffonian Empire has, under the guidance of the Nobility, managed to reclaim the Griffonian Heartlands. While many of the still independent Griffon Kingdoms were hoping that Duchess Gabriela and her noble allies would be satisfied with the realm they've carved out for themselves, it seems that this will not be case, as today the Duchess, with her young protege Emperor Grover VI in tow, made a speech announcing that the Griffonian Empire shall not stop until all griffons are united under it's banner once more."
 imperial.39.a:0 "It seems there is still hope for the Empire..."
 imperial.40.t:0 "The Fight against illiteracy begins"
 imperial.40.d:0 "It appears our campaign against illiteracy is bearing some initial fruit, as middle and lower class citizens begin to read simple texts."
 imperial.40.a:0 "It's a start."
 imperial.41.t:0 "Improved literacy"
 imperial.41.d:0 "Our ongoing program against illiteracy is beginning to show its worth, as more and more children are being enlisted in schools. Not only this, but many adults are also now taking reading classes."
 imperial.41.a:0 "I'm sure those chicks will enjoy school lots."
 imperial.42.t:0 "Fighting Illiteracy"
 imperial.42.d:0 "Our war against illiteracy is now almost at an end, with illiteracy rates at an all-time low and most citizens having completed at least a basic level of education."
 imperial.42.a:0 "The war is nearly over!"
 imperial.43.t:0 "Victory"
 imperial.43.d:0 "After many years of more or less forcing our people to educate themselves, we have finally managed to all but eradicate illiteracy within our nation. Our future shines just a little bit brighter."
 imperial.43.a:0 "Finally!"
 imperial.44.t:0 "The Coronation"
 imperial.44.d:0 "Today marks a wonderful day in the reconstituted Griffonian Empire! This morning, rising with the dawning sun, Grover, sixth of his line, was crowned Emperor. Upon coming of age, the young chick is no longer that, but a proud member and glorious leader of the Grand Empire. The ceremony itself was a beautiful affair, with the Archonate Choir providing all the soundtrack necessary. Archon Eros the now former Lord Regent gave a short speech, calling forth visions of a wonderful and glorious future for the Empire. The crown was rested upon its rightful owner’s head, and the crowd present cheered for their new Emperor. Then, all were asked for silence, as Grover gave his speech. "Friends. Brothers and Sisters: We have finally returned our Holy Griffonian Empire from the darkness of this Generation. And even still, our foes stand against us, ready to strike. But this matters not. With the gods on our side, none can stand against us, truly. From this day forward, we will march confidently towards our destiny; not one step back!""
 imperial.44.a:0 "Long live the Emperor! Long live the Empire!"
 imperial.45.t:0 "The Coronation"
 imperial.45.d:0 "Today marks a new chapter in the history of the Griffonian Empire! On this bright and sunny morning, Grover VI, heir to the throne of the Empire, was crowned Emperor in full by the Lady Regent Duchess Gabriela. Following a short speech by the Regent, the Emperor himself took to the stage, and spoke of the Empire’s future prospects. "Friends... My people. Our past years, the years of my childhood, have been long and difficult. We have been made to fight - militarily, economically, and psychologically, against all odds and all those who would threaten our way of life. But today is not a day of war. Today is a day of success and peace, of victory and serenity. Today marks the end of our past, and the beginning of a bright future. The Empire has returned, and together, friends, we shall lead Griffonia into a new golden age. An age of peace and prosperity!"
 imperial.45.a:0 "Long Live the Emperor! Long live the Empire!"
 imperial.46.t:0 "Industrial Development"
 imperial.46.d:0 "The members of the IAC, despite not being capable of getting enough state funding to fulfil the production goals set for them by the Crown, have decided to use money out of their own pockets to fund the construction of several new factories around the Empire."
 imperial.46.a:0 "How nice of them."
 imperial.47.t:0 "Railroad Construction"
 imperial.47.d:0 "The IAC has recently decided to set aside a certain amount of their budget to construct several new railways to both connect the Empire and increase our industrial production."
 imperial.47.a:0 "More trains are good. I like trains."
 imperial.48.t:0 "Scandal Within the Palace"
 imperial.48.d:0 "The Noble Advisory Council, founded by the Imperial Regent, was created to both raise and advise the young Emperor Grover, as well as govern the nation while he matures. Certain members have been using their spots on the council to advance their social position or increase their own wealth. However, many of our citizens expect the nobility to be at least somewhat corrupt. Even still, it is hard to ignore, let alone tolerate an orgy within the imperial palace between multiple members of the council. The Press, naturally, had a field day. The local authorities and witnesses... not so much."
 imperial.48.a:0 "The Aristocracy!"
 imperial.49.t:0 "Noble Deeds"
 imperial.49.d:0 "As of recently, the Noble Advisory Council has been doing their job with an extra lack of corruption or indecency. While we don't know the reason for this change of policy, our citizens are satisfied with the current situation. For now."
 imperial.49.a:0 "That's new."
 imperial.50.t:0 "The Knights of Arcturius"
 imperial.50.d:0 "Ever since we gave both funding and support to the Knights of Arcturius, they have been working tirelessly to improve the nation in any way they can. This has manifested itself in many ways, from building schools to repairing temples and more recently building their own paramilitary organisations. While these so called Squires are officially trainee knights they more or less fulfil the role of the Order's personal military police. This has increased support for the Imperial Regent and the Council of Three, but needless to say it has left some of our citizens slightly worried."
 imperial.50.a:0 "The innocent have nothing to fear."
 imperial.51.t:0 "Alms for the Poor"
 imperial.51.d:0 "Since State Eleos has been restored by the Archonate of Eyr, both the Archons and the few pious amongst the nobility have been working tirelessly on improving the lives of the common griffon. These efforts have not gone unnoticed by our people, as support for the Council of Three and the Emperor is once more on the rise."
 imperial.51.a:0 "Great!"
 imperial.53.t:0 "The Maréchal and the Emperor"
 imperial.53.d:0 "Leonard Rodier the infamous Maréchal and one of Aquileia's greatest generals has decided to come before us. It is no secret that Rodier decided to leave his homeland after the Second Revolution due to his belief of Aquileia failing as a nation, thus he has come before us to offer his services to our nation in the hopes that he might one day return to his beloved homeland and liberate it from the Republicans and Communists that have overrun it."
 imperial.53.a:0 "Welcome aboard, now please take a shower."
 imperial.53.b:0 "Go away Rodier, no one likes you."
 imperial.55.t:0 "Griffonia Demands Servitude"
 imperial.55.d:0 "The Imperial Regent, perhaps feeling emboldened by his more recent successes has decided to issue us an ultimatum... Serve the Empire or be destroyed, needless to say this ominous message has caused quite a stir within our entire country, but the question remains what shall we do?"
 imperial.55.a:0 "Let them come!"
 imperial.55.b:0 "We can't hope to stand against them..."
 imperial.56.t:0 "Skyfall Does not Bend"
 imperial.56.d:0 "Perhaps somewhat predictably the government of Skyfall has decided to not bow down before us, how shall we respond?"
 imperial.56.a:0 "How cute, they think they have a choice."
 imperial.56.b:0 "But, I like their whiskey..."
 imperial.57.t:0 "Skyfall Submits"
 imperial.57.d:0 "Unexpectedly the government of Skyfall has decided to submit to our demands, bringing the second largest city in Griffonia back under our control with not a drop of blood spilled."
 imperial.57.a:0 "Install a friendly government, and watch the money pile up."
 imperial.58.t:0 "The Fate of Aquileia"
 imperial.58.d:0 "After a gruelling battle we have managed to finally defeat Aquileia, our biggest rival in Western Griffonia, however despite their defeat it seems that our issues in Aquileia are far from over. Marshal Rodier, perhaps emboldened by his role in helping defeat Aquileia has all but demanded that Aquileia become an autonomous region within our Empire, with himself at it's head. What shall we do?"
 imperial.58.a:0 "Let Rodier have his little playground."
 imperial.58.b:0 "You must be joking?"
 imperial.59.t:0 "The Aquileian Rebellion"
 imperial.59.d:0 "Betrayal! Marshal Rodier and his Aquileian brethren have risen up all across the former Kingdom and after kicking out our soldiers, declared an Aquileian State under the leadership of Rodier and his MPA lackeys, it seems that our Aquileian troubles have only just begun."
 imperial.59.a:0 "I want the bastard's head on a spike!"
 imperial.60.t:0 "Of Things That Never Happened"
 imperial.60.d:0 "An interesting book was published today, Of Things That Never Happened by Barys Solartail follows the life of a character simply known as Ropshin, a Republican terrorist who has been ordered by his superiors to assassinate a Wingbardian Noble. While the premise of the story is rather simple the writer focuses more on the character of Ropshin and his beliefs than the actual plot of the story, some critics have even pointed out that at times it feels as if the character and the writer are the same person. Nevertheless the book has been generally warmly received both by commoners and nobles alike."
 imperial.60.a:0 "Ropshin you say? Where have I heard that name before?"
 imperial.61.t:0 "The Empire Strikes Back"
 imperial.61.d:0 "For a long time now, politicians and military staff within [Root.GetName] have eyed the renewed Rise of the Griffonian Empire across the Sea with a great deal of dread. Today, their fears have been confirmed, at last. A formal Request was sent to [Root.GetLeader] by the Empire, in which is stated that our Land was once part of the imperial realm, and that it still belonged to the Empire nowadays. They demand our immediate submission to the Imperial Crown, and that we return our status back to that of a Colony of the Empire. This would effectively undo all our efforts of making ourselves a strong, independent Country. However, it is without a doubt that the Empire is a force to be reckoned with, once more. What is our reply?"
 imperial.61.a:0 "No! Never again!"
 imperial.61.b:0 "An Emperor does not bow to another Emperor! Charge!"
 imperial.61.c:0 "It's our only option..."
 imperial.62.t:0 "[From.GetName] does not bend!"
 imperial.62.d:0 "The fiendish fools over in [From.GetName] have had the audacity to refuse our rightful reclamation of Colonial soil. Very well. If they do not bend the knee voluntarily, we shall make them bleed until they do."
 imperial.62.a:0 "Have at them!"
 imperial.63.t:0 "[From.GetName] bends!"
 imperial.63.d:0 "Those spineless cowards over in [From.GetName] have finally seen reason, and have agreed to our demand. [From.GetLeader] has already requested an audience with the Regency Council, willing to resubmit to the Empire. Our old colonial possessions finally return to the fold."
 imperial.63.a:0 "A wise Choice!"
 imperial.64.t:0 "Perfect time to strike"
 imperial.64.d:0 "While we and [WNG.GetName] are at war with [GRW.GetName], it is the optimal time for us to declare war on [WNG.GetName] and reclaim the southern coast of Griffonia."
 imperial.64.a:0 "Forwards!"
 imperial.64.b:0 "Yes."
 imperial.64.c:0 "Not now."
 imperial.65.t:0 "The Republican Dream"
 imperial.65.d:0 "A few days ago, one of the most famous modern day authors in the Griffonian Empire, Friedrich Winger, released his newest Book called 'The Republican Dream'. In the Book, Winger looks back at the Republican Revolution inside the Griffonian Empire. He makes an effort to not only teach History, but also attempts to show that some of the Republican thoughts were quite progressive for the time, and they could still be a valid and necessary addition to imperial society today. After harsh backlash from Public, Winger once again clarified that he supports the Crown, and that he does not affiliate himself with the Republic in any way. The Book has so far been a moderate success in the Empire itself, but saw even greater success in other Countries, such as Aquileia."
 imperial.65.a:0 "A surprisingly interesting read."
 imperial.65.b:0 "A load of potentially dangerous nonsense."
 imperial.66.t:0 "The Imperial Banquet"
 imperial.66.d:0 "The Imperial Banquet is an ancient Griffonian tradition that dates back to the glory days of the Empire. Every ten years, nobles from all corners of the Empire would assemble at the capital of Griffenheim to spend one - sometimes even two - joyful evenings together. This helped strengthen our ties with the many dukes and princes of the Empire, and allowed the Emperor to improve relations with them.\n\nThe next Banquet is scheduled in just a few weeks, but our court is unsure about the exact procedures. Considering our weakened hold over the continent, it is unsure whether we should invite only those nobles still loyal to the Empire, or whether we should extend a claw to all who once were under our banner as a sign of good will."
 imperial.66.a:0 "We don't dine with traitors!"
 imperial.66.b:0 "A grand feast for all!"
 imperial.67.t:0 "The Banquet"
 imperial.67.d:0 "The night went along smoothly. Carriage after carriage arrived in front of the Imperial Palace, the most important of which were greeted by the regent, [Root.GetLeader], and even young Grover VI himself. This banquet was quite clearly one of the smaller ones, and the mood seemed to be sour at first. Soon, however, the memories of old returned to our guests, and the celebrations began. Games were played, words were exchanged, jokes were made. At the start of the Great Feast, the Duchess made a great speech. She spoke of ages long passed, and how it was the Empire's duty to carry on and reclaim its legacy and destiny. In the end, three cheers were had for our young Emperor."
 imperial.67.a:0 "We've made our resolve clear."
 imperial.68.t:0 "An Invitation"
 imperial.68.d:0 "A messenger from [From.GetNameDef] has just reached the court of [Root.GetLeader], delivering a formal invitation from [From.GetLeader]. It appears that despite our rivalry with the Empire, [Root.GetLeader] has been invited to the Imperial Banquet over in Griffenheim, an ancient griffon tradition that dates back over one hundred years. Many a dozen nobles have been invited, and we could use this opportunity to - just for one night - forget our differences and grudges with the Imperials."
 imperial.68.a:0 "It's all in good spirit, I suppose..."
 imperial.68.b:0 "We don't dine with Imperial Scum!"
 imperial.69.t:0 "The Banquet"
 imperial.69.d_vassals_only:0 "Once a grand assembly of Griffonian nobility, the Banquet was a rather awkward experience for all. Only the few loyal nobles arrived to join us and celebrate, and the grand Imperial Palace has never seemed this empty. The Regent and young Grover VI also attended the Banquet, and tried to improve relations with the few nobles that showed up, but it was a quiet, uneventful and awkward night, nonetheless. The once Grand Feast at the end of the Banquet was nothing more but a reminder of how large and powerful the Empire once was, as the vast majority of the room remained unfilled."
 imperial.69.a:0 "At least we kept the traitors out..."
 imperial.69.d_few:0 "The last night was a rather disappointing and quiet sight to behold. Of the many nobles that were invited, only a small fraction decided to accept.[Root.GetGRIMajorsInvite] [Root.GetLeader] and young Grover VI attended as well, and attempted to lighten the mood in the rather empty-looking halls of the Imperial Palace. The Grand Feast marked the end of the celebrations, and yet many places on the table remained empty. The Regent thanked everygriff that showed up, and cursed all of those that remained home under their breath."
 imperial.69.b:0 "Shouldn't have invited them, after all."
 imperial.69.d_most:0 "The last night was a night of pomp and old glory. Many of the invited nobles made up their minds and accepted our good will.[Root.GetGRIMajorsInvite] The great halls of the Imperial Palace were filled with Nobility, truly reminding many of the old days of the Empire, and even bringing back nostalgia to some. The mood was light and joyful, and after some time even the deepest of grudges were forgotten about. The Grand Feast marked the end of the Banquet, and [Root.GetLeader] held a brilliant speech in which they thanked all visitors for their attendance and cooperation. During all the political rivalry and turmoil on the continent, the Banquet showed us that there can be peace between all of us, yet."
 imperial.69.c:0 "A spark of old glory!"
 imperial.69.d_all:0 "The Nobility on this continent appears to have seen reason and our good will, and all of them went ahead and accepted our invitation. Carriage after carriage they arrived at the Imperial Palace in Griffenheim, being greeted by the young Grover VI and [Root.GetLeader]. Among those nobles were loyalist as well as 'traitors', and even old rivals.[Root.GetGRIMajorsInvite] The mood was a bit shaky at the start, but the ice was soon broken, and old time grudges were forgotten in favour of light-hearted jokes and conversations. It seems that between all of the Griffonian politics, everygriff used this night to simply enjoy the company of each other. Even better, during the Grand Feast at the end of the celebrations, young Grover, with the support of the Regent, held a speech in front all of our guests, announcing his deep thanks to all of them, and stating that this night, if anything, is a sign that peace in Griffonia, between all of us, is possible, after all. We are griffons, in the end. The guests raised their mugs and cheered, and the Feast began."
 imperial.69.e:0 "What a great night!"
 imperial.70.t:0 "The Griffonian Empire Demands Their Land"
 imperial.70.d:0 "The Griffonian Empire is a re-emerging force in the world, and securing an alliance with them was no doubt a good idea. But, as is common with empires, they do have a tendency to claim a lot of territories they have no direct control over. The Empire has formally requested that we transfer control of territories they deem to be theirs over to them. While the loss of this territory is not the most optimal situation, the risk of angering the Empire might outweigh the loss, what will our response be?"
 imperial.70.a:0 "Transfer the lands over to the Empire, we can ill afford to anger them."
 imperial.70.b:0 "We cannot bow to such a ridiculous demand."
 imperial.71.t:0 "[From.GetName] Accepts Our Demands"
 imperial.71.d:0 "Fantastic news! Our wise [From.GetAdjective] allies have seen that our claims to the lands they hold are truly just, and as such have agreed to transfer control of them over to us. This is a great day for all griffons, as the Empire takes one more step towards unification."
 imperial.71.a:0 "Great!"
 imperial.72.t:0 "[From.GetName] Refuses Our Demands"
 imperial.72.d:0 "Our "allies" in [From.GetName] have proven themselves unwilling to recognize our rightful dominion over the lands they hold, and have denied our request of a territorial transfer. Is it truly right to call them our allies if they deny us this request?"

 GRI_agricultural_support:0 "Agricultural Aid"
 GRI_agricultural_support_desc:0 "Through the system of feudalism and serfdom, agriculture has been the Empire's speciality for millenia. Now however, the industrialisation has pushed our farmers to the brink of extinction and bankruptcy. We must incentivise farming and subsidise agriculture at once."
 GRI_industrial_farms:0 "Agricultural Mechanisation"
 GRI_industrial_farms_desc:0 "Who is to say industrialisation and agriculture can't aid one another? By adding machines to our agricultural sector, we can mechanise and automise a large chunk of the process, improving productivity."

 GRI_krahe_contract_desc:0 "The Krähe-Stahl company is the oldest industrial company in the Empire, being the ones who brought industrialisation to the Empire. By reaching an agreement with them, we could not only encourage their growth, but also reap the benefits of their work."
 GRI_imperial_railway:0 "The Imperial Railway"
 GRI_imperial_railway_desc:0 "Our railway system is lackluster to say the least. If we want to use the speed and versatility of trains effectively, we must invest into the imperial railway system."
 GRI_crona_industry:0 "The Reichswaffen Contract"
 GRI_crona_industry_desc:0 "Reichswaffen is the most prominent weapons manufacturer, and was founded by a childhood friend of Grover IV.

 GRI_tech_schools:0 "The Griffonian Standard"

 GRI_electronics_department:0 "Subsidise Blautronik"
 GRI_electronics_department_desc:0 "Blautronik is a new, enterprising group of griffons who think that the future of the Empire lies in automisation and technology. It may seem far-fetched now, but who knows? They could be the pioneers of progress we need."
 GRI_humanities_department:0 "Cultural R&D Department"
 GRI_humanities_department_desc:0 "We are Griffons through and through: Talons, wings, and a desire to fight! But even though we are already strong, we could perhaps figure out new ways to use our natural-given strengths."
 GRI_northern_roads:0 "Connect the North"
 GRI_northern_roads_desc:0 "The North has once more rejoined the Empire's warm embrace. However, these lands are cut off from the railway system that is already in place in the imperial heartland. We must rectify this and connect the Empire!"
 GRI_take_northern_industry:0 "Nationalise the M-R-V Basin"
 GRI_take_northern_industry_desc:0 "The M-R-V Basin was the biggest industrial center of both Strawberry and Feathisia. Now, with these lands under imperial rule once again, it is time to nationalise these newly gained industrial assets to use them to our advantage."

 GRI_southern_roads:0 "Into the Scheißwald"

 GRI_take_southern_industry:0 "Nationalise the R-G-G Basin"
 GRI_take_southern_industry_desc:0 "The South is ours once more, and with it, the valuable industry these lands hold. Perhaps it is time to nationalise these assets in order to aid the Empire and prepare for what is to come."

 GRI_skyfall_dockyards_focus_desc:0 "The Skyfall trade port is the biggest in all of Griffonia, and was once the Empire's crown jewel when it came to naval power.

 GRI_skyfall_industry:0 "No More Trade Princes"

 GRI_cat_fleet_in_being_f_desc:0 "Admiral Hellcrest is a respected sailor from the glory days of nautical warfare, and has strong opinions on how war upon the open sea should be fought. Perhaps he can rebuild our navy into the grand fleet it used to be?"

 GRI_cat_trade_interdiction_f_desc:0 "A curious griffon who we nearly lost to Nova Griffonia when the empire split apart, Stormfeather is a proponent of what he calls "U-boats", and believes that our way forward is to convert our surface fleet to a new, modern, trade hunting fleet. Perhaps this is a good way forward?"
 GRI_carrier_f:0 "Jade Class Carriers"
 GRI_carrier_f_desc:0 "Our Engineers have drawn the first blueprints for a new, promising battleship, which will be able to carry, launch and recover airplanes on the sea. It shows much promise, and it would be a missed opportunity to scrap this project."
 GRI_naval_aviation_f:0 "Naval Aviation Initiative"
 GRI_naval_aviation_f_desc:0 "Naval Aviation has come a long way, but must go even further to compete with modern ships and equipment. With a proper naval aerial strike force, we can truly take control of the waves, and the skies above them."

 GRI_rottenedam_dock_desc:0 "The Rottenedam Dockyards have shown promise in the most recent past, and with the reconquest of these docks, it would be wise to further expand the facilities and our shipbuilding capabilities."
 GRI_light_cruiser_f:0 "Light Cruiser Models"
 GRI_light_cruiser_f_desc:0 "Light Cruiser form the very backbone of any modern fleet, this much we know. As such, we must work to perfect our cruiser designs, so that our spine can never be broken in battle."
 GRI_battlecruiser_f:0 "Crona Class Battlecruiser"
 GRI_battlecruiser_f_desc:0 "Better armed than a light cruiser but not as maneuverable, the Battlecruiser forms an excellent alternative to the more bulky battleships. With acceptable speed and maneuverability, it is more than able to deliver precise, heavy ordinance strikes."
 GRI_battleship_f:0 "Modern Battleship Models"
 GRI_battleship_f_desc:0 "The crown jewels of any fleet are its battleships, the very flagships. We must show the world that the imperial fleet has progressed, and that we are a force to be reckoned with on the seas!"
 GRI_destroyer_f:0 "Trade Escorts"
 GRI_destroyer_f_desc:0 "Small and nimble, the Destroyer is an ideal class of ship for escort duty and anti-submarine missions. Using depth charges, they are more than capable of screening and protecting our valuable trade routes."
 GRI_submarine_f:0 "U-Boat Experiments"
 GRI_submarine_f_desc:0 "Modern technology has revealed new techniques that supposedly allow ships to remain underwater for extended periods of time, even in battle. These Underwater Boats, or U-Boats, could be of great use to us, and could harass enemy forces and convoys easily."
 GRI_skyfall_dock:0 "A New Home Port"
 GRI_skyfall_dock_desc:0 "The City of Skyfall has been reclaimed for the Empire, and with it, the great Skyfall Docks have also returned to the fold. As the largest dock in Griffonia, it will serve us well in this new age."
 GRI_griffonian_marines:0 "The Seebataillon"

 GRI_transport_f:0 "Better Landing Craft"
 GRI_transport_f_desc:0 "To ensure the continued success of naval invasions onto foreign soil, we must make sure that we can fit as many able-bodied griffons onto our landing craft as possible. More numbers means there is a higher chance of success, plain and simple."

 GRI_infantry_equipment_f_desc:0 "Our muskets of old are getting to the point of uselessness due to modern military doctrines. If we have any hope to keep up with our neighbours, we must modernise. New, shinier, and more importantly, deadlier guns are in order."
 GRI_support_equipment_f:0 "Clean Bandages"
 GRI_support_equipment_f_desc:0 "We need to reconsider our stance on how we treat our wounded. Quite frankly, our "battlefield doctors" are terrible, and this is getting more griffons killed out of battle than in battle. We urgently need to fix this problem."
 GRI_artillery_f:0 "Bigger Guns"
 GRI_artillery_f_desc:0 "Not only do we need better guns, but larger guns as well. The age of cannons has passed, and the thunder of artillery will make our enemy tremble before us."
 GRI_light_tank_f:0 "Armoured Tractors"
 GRI_light_tank_f_desc:0 "A couple enterprising griffons have approached us with the idea to slap armoured plates onto a tractor, like a large piece of armour plating. While this particular model doesn't pose much of a threat, perhaps such a new type of vehicle could be of good use?"
 GRI_doctrine_grand_battlepan:0 "Bronzetail's Ball Busting Fortresses"
 GRI_doctrine_grand_battlepan_desc:0 "Bronzetail believes that we should make our defensive positions so unassailable that the enemy either does not go forward, or does so with unacceptable casualties. Perhaps this is the military focus we should follow, his patent pending name aside."
 GRI_support_equipment_f_but_better:0 "Nachrichten-Versuchskommando"
 GRI_support_equipment_f_but_better_desc:0 "With a dedicated messaging service for our military, we can ensure that messages are relayed correctly and in time. This will aid our frontline units and general staff equally."

 GRI_enigma_code_desc:0 "A brilliant piece of military engineering, developed by an electronics engineer named Edward Nigma, E. Nigma’s code is a modern and supposedly impossible to break secret message code, that we should focus on spreading and implementing in our military as fast as possible."

 GRI_doctrine_superior_firepower_desc:0 "The more the merrier. August believes we should focus on massing as much firepower as possible, as often as possible, so as to break our enemies as quickly as possible, with as little loss of our own lives as we can. Perhaps we should make this our main military focus."
 GRI_infantry_equipment_f_but_better:0 "Modern Firearms"
 GRI_infantry_equipment_f_but_better_desc:0 "While our old weapons have served us well in the past, it's time to catch up to the world. These new rifles are a far cry from our old muskets and bayonets, and will take some time to learn to use properly, but the updated designs are highly important in keeping us on the edge of technology."
 GRI_motorized_f:0 "Armoured Cars and Trucks"
 GRI_motorized_f_desc:0 "With our successful tractor experiments, we have decided that it would be a good idea to put armour on our cars and trucks as well, to give them a similar role in battle, and to continue modernising our force."
 GRI_artillery_f_but_better:0 "Mass Artillery Bombardment"
 GRI_artillery_f_but_better_desc:0 "Using massive amounts of Artillery, we can destroy enemy formations, as well as morale. When our troops finally close on the enemy, they will surely rout sooner than later."
 GRI_mobile_warfare_focus:0 "Thundertail's Shock and Awe"
 GRI_mobile_warfare_focus_desc:0 "Thundertail believes that the way to win our wars is to attack as fast as possible, with as much power as we can without sacrificing our rapid advance. Thus, we overtake our enemies before they are able to realise we’re right on top of them. Perhaps we should make this our main military focus?"
 GRI_light_tank_fs:0 "Proper Tanks"
 GRI_light_tank_fs_desc:0 "With the success of our tractor experiments, it is time to fully develop the "tank", as it's being called, and turn it into a proper weapon of war, rather than a hodgepodged prototype. Standardisation and upgraded designs are in order, as soon as possible."
 GRI_medium_tank:0 "Heavier Tanks"
 GRI_medium_tank_desc:0 "While our proper modern tanks are good and well, we should make attempts at heavier, more armoured and powerful designs."
 GRI_heavy_tank:0 "Moving Forts"

 GRI_military_academy:0 "The Imperial Military Academy"
 GRI_military_academy_desc:0 "Our Military has come a long way from its humble beginnings. And yet, there is so much more that it can learn and improve upon. It is time to open up and fund an academy dedicated to training the next generation’s bright, young military minds. Who knows what the future holds?"
 GRI_spec_ops_initiative:0 "The Kommando Spezialkräfte"
 GRI_spec_ops_initiative_desc:0 "The imperial army might have come a long way, thus far, but we still lack dedicated special forces within our ranks. It's about time we introduced these troops, as they will aid us in conquering even the most difficult territories of Griffonia."
 GRI_rocket_artillery_f_but_better:0 "Nebelwerfer"
 GRI_rocket_artillery_f_but_better_desc:0 "The Nebelwerfer is a rocket launcher that launches incendiary grenades in a high arc towards enemy positions.

 GRI_project_arcturus:0 "Project Arcturius"
 GRI_project_arcturus_desc:0 "Arcturius, your fierce-hearted sons call for your aid, oh full-famed god of war. To you do soldiers pray when battle is most heated, when mettle is most needed. To you as well do we turn in desperate times, to you do we call for strength, for the spirit to endure. To you we pray to turn their worlds to ash..."
 GRI_rocket_project:0 "Project Eyr"

 GRI_air_superior:0 "Battlefield Support Doctrine"
 GRI_air_superior_desc:0 "A mobile and agile wing of dive bombers is ideal for our air force, as it enables us to support our ground forces anywhere on the battlefield rapidly and precisely. With solid, precise air support, no offense or defense can stand in our way!"
 GRI_operational_integrit:0 "Operational Integrity Doctrine"
 GRI_operational_integrit_desc:0 "To support both defensive and offensive maneuvers on the ground, our air force must prove itself dominant over the enemy's aerial forces. Only if we can wrest control over the skies will our troops be safe, and only then can victory be ensured."
 GRI_expand_airbases:0 "Expand the Imperial Airbases"
 GRI_expand_airbases_desc:0 "The Empire is in dire need of new, expanded air bases. Without them, we are unable to utilise any of our air power. We must construct new bases at once!"

 GRI_fighter_focus:0 "Wings of Steel"
 GRI_fighter_focus_desc:0 "A strong air force naturally relies on a strong fighter presence. Without good, reliable fighter models, we might as well scrap the idea of aerial supremacy altogether. We must ensure that we possess the most modern design schemes for our fighters at all times!"
 GRI_heavy_fighter_focus:0 "Beaks of Steel"
 GRI_heavy_fighter_focus_desc:0 "Even stronger, but also heavier versions of our fighters would aid us in maintaining aerial supremacy. With more and bigger guns, these machines could easily destroy whatever the enemy throws at us."

 GRI_calm_the_fuck_down:0 "Please Send Help"
 GRI_calm_the_fuck_down_desc:0 "Ferdinand has sent out a call for assistance to the few units loyal to him outside the city.

 GRI_secure_the_streets_desc:0 "With our reinforcements finally having arrived and Griffenheim firmly in our hands the time has come to enforce order on the streets.

 GRI_a_bullet_for_the_priests_desc:0 "The Knights of the empire have apparently not gotten it through their skulls that we are in charge.

 GRI_a_message_desc:0 "A certain griffon has been a thorn in our side ever since the coup. He does possess a large amount of influence within the empire, and moving against him will certainly be difficult. But if he cannot accept the new status quo, then he must go. "
 GRI_traitors_within:0 "A Bullet For the Soldiers"
 GRI_traitors_within_desc:0 "The military has been pretty firmly split between those who support Ferdinand and those who are against it. Now, if we consider this from a legal perspective, if they refuse to accept the authority of the government then they refuse to accept the authority of the empire. That is quite clearly treason, and the punishment for treason is quite clear."
 GRI_what_they_deserve:0 "And a Noose For the Commanders"
 GRI_what_they_deserve_desc:0 "Now that the soldiers have been dealt with, the time has come for us to deal with the officers.

 grover_v_desc:0 "Nominally the Emperor of all Griffonia, Grover V has had a difficult life. Never the most healthy of griffons, he has lost his father to a stroke, and with that, woe soon came to the Empire. The loss of the Idol of Boreas, the Republican Uprising of 978, millions of dead griffons - Grover could only watch and weep as the events unfolded. Nonetheless, the Emperor could count on his good friends, notably Archon Eros VII and Duchess Gabriella Eagleclaw, to keep him safe from the worst and guide him in ruling what remained of loyalists. An unifying force for the Heartlands, Grover has developed a sense of grim determination and does his best to maintain the Empire's legacy, regardless of his personal issues."
 eros_vii_desc:0 "One of the oldest living griffons, Archon Eros VII was born when the Empire was at the height of its power. At a young age, he joined the priesthood of Boreas out of genuine respect for the Gods. His pious devotion and humble manner has led him to quickly rise to the position of Archon, and all seemed well. Yet cruel fate had in store to render the Empire asunder, with the loss of the Idol of Boreas and the incompetent Council of Regents dragging the country to the ground. He was responsible for saving the young Grover V's life from the claws of Republican insurgents, and has maintained a close friendship with him ever since. This is why he protects the late Emperor's son, Grover VI, and hopes that once his regency is over, he will rule an unified Empire. Yet Eros has little love for the nobility of the Empire, believing them to be responsible for every misfortune that has plagued the Heartlands. And now, with the broad support of the commonfolk, Eros and his fellow Archons are attempting the restore the Empire's glory. The traitors and unbelievers will pay with their blood, Boreas wills it!"
 pink_birb_desc:0 "First cousin to the Emperor, Duchess Gabriella Eagleclaw is one of most powerful nobles in the Heartlands and Grover V's personal friend. Her charisma and force of personality, not to mention her sizable personal properties and wealth, has placed her in a position where she can command most of the petty lords. She has always championed for the cause of her peers, but she is not blind to the plight of the common griffon and wishes to introduce limited reforms to the system, genuinely wishing for the people to have a good life, proud of their country. All she does, she does it in honour of her friend, the late Emperor, and holds in contempt the Archons, believing that they'll ruin the country with their dangerously radical ideas. Until the Emperor's son is old enough to ascend to the throne, Gabriella balances her many responsiblities and leads the Empire to a new dawn."

 ### Imperial Events ###
 imperial.1.t:0 "A Train Trip"
 imperial.1.d:0 "Despite his deteriorating health, the Emperor has decided to embark on a trip through the Empire via train, in order to showcase the new imperial railway system and, more importantly, convince the people that his days are not yet over. Reluctantly, after heavily protesting against the trip and arguing that he should stay in bed, the Emperor's doctors let him go."
 imperial.1.a:0 "What's the worst that could happen?"
 imperial.2.t:0 "A Perfectly Normal Day"
 imperial.2.d:0 "All seemed to have been going well in court today as the Emperor met noble after noble, listening to their petty complaints, pretending to be listening to their pleas while trying to not fall asleep... until the Emperor collapsed without warning. He was quickly rushed to his private chambers and is currently being taken care of by the Empire's finest medical experts."
 imperial.2.a:0 "His days might be over, at last..."
 imperial.3.t:0 "The Emperor is Dead"
 imperial.3.d:0 "Unfortunately, after nearly a month of treatments and therapy, Emperor Grover the Fifth of his name was embraced by the claws of Boreas at the young age of 54. Due to his only son and heir Prince Grover VI not being of the age in which he is capable of ruling the country himself, a Regency Council consisting of Nobles, Merchant Princes and Church Officials shall take over the apparatus of state until a more suitable solution is found..."
 imperial.3.a:0 "Boreas save us all!"
 imperial.4.t:0 "On the Matter of the Regency"
 imperial.4.d:0 "The first real issue the Regency Council is facing is who exactly it should allow into the council itself. The nobility, lead by Duchess Gabriela Eagleclaw, has proposed that only those of high birth should be able to attend and vote upon matters of importance in the Council, which would effectively exclude the majority of both merchant princes and the various church officials from voting. What no one was expecting, however, was the various religious organisations within our country uniting under the banner of Archon Eros VII of the Borean Temple, and declaring that the entire council should not only be able to vote, but that they should also open the doors to influential commoners."
 imperial.4.a:0 "Only the Highborn shall vote!"
 imperial.4.b:0 "Open our Doors to the Commoners!"
 imperial.5.t:0 "On the Matter Commoner Rights"
 imperial.5.d:0 "The second issue we face is: how exactly should the average commoner be treated within the Empire? The nobility, pompous as ever, has stated that those who live upon their land are their property and shall remain as such. On the other claw, Archon Eros has proposed that we gradually give rights to all griffons, lowborn or not."
 imperial.5.a:0 "Power to the Aristocracy!"
 imperial.5.b:0 "Power to the People!"
 imperial.6.t:0 "The Great Betrayal"
 imperial.6.d:0 "After nearly a month since we managed to secure the Regency Council's support for our cause it seemed as if things were finally calming down in the Capital after all these initial power struggles. Unfortunately, we were proven wrong, as today, during a council meeting, Duchess Gabriela Eagleclaw and several allies of her simply left the room, followed by the lords of Bronzehill, Feathisia and Greifenheim. Hours later, they all announced their formal secession from the Empire..."
 imperial.6.a:0 "Traitors! Every Single one of them!"
 imperial.7.t:0 "The Sad Truth"
 imperial.7.d:0 "The sad truth is that we simply cannot hope to fight against Eros on our own. If we intend to survive this mess we must convince our fellow lords to work together. Only then will we be strong enough to stand up to Eros."
 imperial.7.a:0 "Send out the messengers."
 imperial.7.b:0 "We can fight Griffonia on our own, thank you very much."
 imperial.8.t:0 "An Invitation"
 imperial.8.d:0 "It seems that the Duchess has once again called upon us to assist her. She believes that none of the secessionist states can hope to stand up against the Archon and his lackeys alone, and that we are inclined to agree with her. Furthermore, she has proposed a formal alliance between our two nations."
 imperial.8.a:0 "We must work together."
 imperial.8.b:0 "We can take on the Archon on our own."
 imperial.9.t:0 "An Invitation"
 imperial.9.d:0 "It seems that the Duchess has once again called upon us to assist her. She believes that none of the secessionist states can hope to stand up against the Archon and his lackeys alone, and that we are inclined to agree with her. Furthermore, she has proposed a formal alliance between our two nations."
 imperial.9.a:0 "We must work together."
 imperial.9.b:0 "We can take on the Archon on our own."
 imperial.10.t:0 "An Invitation"
 imperial.10.d:0 "It seems that the Duchess has once again called upon us to assist her. She believes that none of the secessionist states can hope to stand up against the Archon and his lackeys alone, and that we are inclined to agree with her. Furthermore, she has proposed a formal alliance between our two nations."
 imperial.10.a:0 "We must work together."
 imperial.10.b:0 "We can take on the Archon on our own."
 imperial.11.t:0 "Bronzehill Accepts"
 imperial.11.d:0 "The Lord of Bronzehill has decided to join the Griffonian Protection Alliance."
 imperial.11.a:0 "Great!"
 imperial.12.t:0 "Feathisia Accepts"
 imperial.12.d:0 "The Lord of Feathisia has decided to join the Griffonian Protection Alliance."
 imperial.12.a:0 "Fantastic!"
 imperial.13.t:0 "Greifenheim Accepts"
 imperial.13.d:0 "The Lord of Greifenheim has decided to join the Griffonian Protection Alliance."
 imperial.13.a:0 "Brilliant!"
 imperial.14.t:0 "An Offer"
 imperial.14.d:0 "It seems that after solidifying their position, the Council of Three has decided to end our autonomy without asking asking us or the Council for consent. While we could most likely veto this decision in the Regency Council and garner the support of what few of the nobility is left, chances are the Archons won't take no for an answer. How do we respond?"
 imperial.14.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept."
 imperial.14.b:0 "To Tartarus with the Archons! Let them come!"
 imperial.14.c:0 "We've got the situation under control."
 imperial.15.t:0 "An Offer"
 imperial.15.d:0 "It seems that after solidifying their position, the Council of Three has decided to end our autonomy without asking asking us or the Council for consent. While we could most likely veto this decision in the Regency Council and garner the support of what few of the nobility is left, chances are the Archons won't take no for an answer. How do we respond?"
 imperial.15.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept."
 imperial.15.b:0 "To Tartarus with the Archons! Let them come!"
 imperial.16.t:0 "An Offer"
 imperial.16.d:0 "It seems that after solidifying their position, the Council of Three has decided to end our autonomy without asking asking us or the Council for consent. While we could most likely veto this decision in the Regency Council and garner the support of what few of the nobility is left, chances are the Archons won't take no for an answer. How do we respond?"
 imperial.16.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept."
 imperial.16.b:0 "To Tartarus with the Archons! Let them come!"
 imperial.17.t:0 "An Offer"
 imperial.17.d:0 "It seems that after solidifying their position, the Council of Three has decided to end our autonomy without asking asking us or the Council for consent.

How do we respond?"
 imperial.17.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept."
 imperial.17.b:0 "To Tartarus with the Archons! Let them come!"
 imperial.18.t:0 "Romau Refuses"
 imperial.18.d:0 "It seems that the Burghers and Lords of Romau have decided to defy us. Needless to say, they made the wrong choice."
 imperial.18.a:0 "Oh well, no one can say we weren't diplomatic."
 imperial.18.b:0 "Let them be, we don't need them."
 imperial.19.t:0 "Yaledom Defies Us"
 imperial.19.d:0 "Graf Mikusian, always the one for theatrics, has decided to deny our little request. It seems that Yaledom must rejoin the Empire by force."
 imperial.19.a:0 "Teach them the price of defiance!"
 imperial.19.b:0 "Yaledom is of no importance to our future plans."
 imperial.20.t:0 "Katerin Defiance"
 imperial.20.d:0 "The Prince of Katerin and his legion of glorified hillbillies have once again proven to be idiots, as they've decided to not rejoin the Empire. Perhaps it's about time we show them the might of the Empire."
 imperial.20.a:0 "Let's crack some skulls!"
 imperial.20.b:0 "The Empire doesn't need them anyways."
 imperial.21.t:0 "The Obvious Suspect"
 imperial.21.d:0 "To no one's surprise, our former ally in the Regency Council, the Baron of Angriver, has decided to defy us. While this was an expected result, it certainly won't stop us from taking what is rightfully ours."
 imperial.21.a:0 "Time to deal with Angriver once and for all!"
 imperial.21.b:0 "Let him rot in his little Barony for all I care!"
 imperial.22.t:0 "The Empire Strikes Back"
 imperial.22.d:0 "After a series of reforms, miraculous victories and countless rebellions, the long suffering Griffonian Empire has, under the guidance of the Council of Three, managed to reclaim the Griffonian Heartlands. While many of the still independent Griffon Kingdoms were hoping that the three Archons would be satisfied with the realm they've carved out for themselves, it seems that this will not be the case, as today Archon Eros VII, with his young protege Emperor Grover VI in tow, made a speech announcing that the Griffonian Empire shall not sit idle until all griffons are united under the Imperial banner once more."
 imperial.22.a:0 "A new Empire is on the rise..."
 imperial.23.t:0 "The Archon's Defiance"
 imperial.23.d:0 "After securing a victory for the Nobility in the Regency Council and alienating both the Eastern lords and the Archons, things were finally somewhat stabilising in the Imperial Capital. Until today that is. After a regular meeting, Archon Eros and Archon Proteus promptly denounced Duchess Gabriela and her allies as heathens and traitors, after which they both left the Capital. They were shortly afterwards joined by the Lord Protector of Romau, Duke of Yaledom, Baron of Angriver and the Prince of Katerin. Several hours after these events they all formally declared their secession from Griffonia..."
 imperial.23.a:0 "Curse you, Archons! Curse you!"
 imperial.24.t:0 "Facing the Facts"
 imperial.24.d:0 "We must face the facts. Gabriela and her lackeys are too numerous and strong for us to tackle alone. We must unite with our fellow lords and fight the heathens to the West!"
 imperial.24.a:0 "Send out the invitations."
 imperial.24.b:0 "We'll fight the Duchess on our own!"
 imperial.25.t:0 "An Invitation"
 imperial.25.d:0 "It seems that the Baron of Angriver and the now exiled Archon Eros have once more called upon us to assist them. They tell us that none of the secessionist states can hope to stand against the Duchess and her lackeys alone, and that we are inclined to agree with them. Furthermore, they have proposed a formal alliance between our two nations."
 imperial.25.a:0 "We must work together!"
 imperial.25.b:0 "We can take the Duchess on by ourselves!"
 imperial.26.t:0 "Romau Accepts"
 imperial.26.d:0 "The Free City of Romau has decided to accept our proposal and join the Holy League."
 imperial.26.a:0 "Great!"
 imperial.27.t:0 "An Invitation"
 imperial.27.d:0 "It seems that the Baron of Angriver and the now exiled Archon Eros have once more called upon us to assist them. They tell us that none of the secessionist states can hope to stand against the Duchess and her lackeys alone, and that we are inclined to agree with them. Furthermore, they have proposed a formal alliance between our two nations."
 imperial.27.a:0 "We must work together!"
 imperial.27.b:0 "We can take the Duchess on by ourselves!"
 imperial.28.t:0 "Yaledom Accepts"
 imperial.28.d:0 "The Duke of Yaledom has decided to accept our proposal and join the Holy League."
 imperial.28.a:0 "Splendid!"
 imperial.29.t:0 "An Invitation"
 imperial.29.d:0 "It seems that the Baron of Angriver and the now exiled Archon Eros have once more called upon us to assist them. They tell us that none of the secessionist states can hope to stand against the Duchess and her lackeys alone, and that we are inclined to agree with them. Furthermore, they have proposed a formal alliance between our two nations."
 imperial.29.a:0 "We must work together!"
 imperial.29.b:0 "We can take the Duchess on by ourselves!"
 imperial.30.t:0 "Katerin Accepts"
 imperial.30.d:0 "The Prince of Katerin has decided to accept our proposal and join the Holy League."
 imperial.30.a:0 "Fantastic!"
 imperial.31.t:0 "Joining the Empire?"
 imperial.31.d:0 "The Duchess, together with several other allies of nobility in the Council, has decided to end the autonomy of what territories the Empire has left. This decision naturally also affects our lands. With our own Duchess as Regent of the Empire, should we accept and let Strawberry be integrated into the Empire?"
 imperial.31.a:0 "Our fate will be that of the Empire."
 imperial.31.b:0 "The Duchess has betrayed her own people!"
 imperial.32.t:0 "An Offer"
 imperial.32.d:0 "It seems that after solidifying their position, the Duchess has come to the conclusion that it would be best to end the autonomy of the Empire's territories and duchies. While we could most likely veto this outrageous decision in the Regency Council and garner the support of what few of the nobility doesn't support her, chances are Gabriela won't take no for an answer. How do we respond?"
 imperial.32.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept."
 imperial.32.b:0 "To Tartarus with the Duchess! Let her come!"
 imperial.33.t:0 "An Offer"
 imperial.33.d:0 "It seems that after solidifying their position, the Duchess has come to the conclusion that it would be best to end the autonomy of the Empire's territories and duchies. While we could most likely veto this outrageous decision in the Regency Council and garner the support of what few of the nobility doesn't support her, chances are Gabriela won't take no for an answer. How do we respond?"
 imperial.33.a:0 "There is nothing we can do..."
 imperial.33.b:0 "Never! Rally our troops!"
 imperial.34.t:0 "An Offer"
 imperial.34.d:0 "It seems that after solidifying their position, the Duchess has come to the conclusion that it would be best to end the autonomy of the Empire's territories and duchies. While we could most likely veto this outrageous decision in the Regency Council and garner the support of what few of the nobility doesn't support her, chances are Gabriela won't take no for an answer. How do we respond?"
 imperial.34.a:0 "It appears our time has come."
 imperial.34.b:0 "If she wants our land, she can come and take it!"
 imperial.35.t:0 "Idiocy in Action"
 imperial.35.d:0 "We have just received word that [From.GetLeader] has taken control over the Duchy of Strawberry. He has managed to rally the population against us, in defiance against our demand for integration."
 imperial.35.a:0 "He and the other traitors must pay!"
 imperial.35.b:0 "A foolish move... but we don't have time for family feuds, right now."
 imperial.36.t:0 "Feathisia Politely Refuses"
 imperial.36.d:0 "It seems that Duke Gerlach has somehow taken our demand to formally rejoin the Empire as something he can politely refuse. Additionally, he has 'politely' ended his country's vassalage and servitude to the Empire. What is our response?"
 imperial.36.a:0 "We politely declare war."
 imperial.36.b:0 "We politely step back."
 imperial.37.t:0 "Bronzehill Defies Us"
 imperial.37.d:0 "It appears the Count of Bronzehill has gone mad, considering he not only refused our request for integration but also insisted on no longer being our vassal."
 imperial.37.a:0 "Up the mountain we go..."
 imperial.37.b:0 "There's plenty of other mountainous no bird's land to reclaim."
 imperial.38.t:0 "Greifenheim's Defiance"
 imperial.38.d:0 "The Duke of Greifenheim has decided to openly defy us and declared himself independent after we called for the integration of our vassals. Surely he is aware of the consequences?"
 imperial.38.a:0 "Let's teach this fool a lesson!"
 imperial.38.b:0 "The Empire doesn't need them, anyways."
 imperial.39.t:0 "The Empire Strikes Back"
 imperial.39.d:0 "After a series of reforms, miraculous victories and countless rebellions, the long suffering Griffonian Empire has, under the guidance of the Nobility, managed to reclaim the Griffonian Heartlands. While many of the still independent Griffon Kingdoms were hoping that Duchess Gabriela and her noble allies would be satisfied with the realm they've carved out for themselves, it seems that this will not be case, as today the Duchess, with her young protege Emperor Grover VI in tow, made a speech announcing that the Griffonian Empire shall not stop until all griffons are united under it's banner once more."
 imperial.39.a:0 "It seems there is still hope for the Empire..."
 imperial.40.t:0 "The Fight against illiteracy begins"
 imperial.40.d:0 "It appears our campaign against illiteracy is bearing some initial fruit, as middle and lower class citizens begin to read simple texts."
 imperial.40.a:0 "It's a start."
 imperial.41.t:0 "Improved literacy"
 imperial.41.d:0 "Our ongoing program against illiteracy is beginning to show its worth, as more and more children are being enlisted in schools. Not only this, but many adults are also now taking reading classes."
 imperial.41.a:0 "I'm sure those chicks will enjoy school lots."
 imperial.42.t:0 "Fighting Illiteracy"
 imperial.42.d:0 "Our war against illiteracy is now almost at an end, with illiteracy rates at an all-time low and most citizens having completed at least a basic level of education."
 imperial.42.a:0 "The war is nearly over!"
 imperial.43.t:0 "Victory"
 imperial.43.d:0 "After many years of more or less forcing our people to educate themselves, we have finally managed to all but eradicate illiteracy within our nation. Our future shines just a little bit brighter."
 imperial.43.a:0 "Finally!"
 imperial.44.t:0 "The Coronation"
 imperial.44.d:0 "Today marks a wonderful day in the reconstituted Griffonian Empire! This morning, rising with the dawning sun, Grover, sixth of his line, was crowned Emperor. Upon coming of age, the young chick is no longer that, but a proud member and glorious leader of the Grand Empire. The ceremony itself was a beautiful affair, with the Archonate Choir providing all the soundtrack necessary. Archon Eros the now former Lord Regent gave a short speech, calling forth visions of a wonderful and glorious future for the Empire. The crown was rested upon its rightful owner’s head, and the crowd present cheered for their new Emperor. Then, all were asked for silence, as Grover gave his speech. "Friends. Brothers and Sisters: We have finally returned our Holy Griffonian Empire from the darkness of this Generation. And even still, our foes stand against us, ready to strike. But this matters not. With the gods on our side, none can stand against us, truly. From this day forward, we will march confidently towards our destiny; not one step back!""
 imperial.44.a:0 "Long live the Emperor! Long live the Empire!"
 imperial.45.t:0 "The Coronation"
 imperial.45.d:0 "Today marks a new chapter in the history of the Griffonian Empire! On this bright and sunny morning, Grover VI, heir to the throne of the Empire, was crowned Emperor in full by the Lady Regent Duchess Gabriela. Following a short speech by the Regent, the Emperor himself took to the stage, and spoke of the Empire’s future prospects. "Friends... My people. Our past years, the years of my childhood, have been long and difficult. We have been made to fight - militarily, economically, and psychologically, against all odds and all those who would threaten our way of life. But today is not a day of war. Today is a day of success and peace, of victory and serenity. Today marks the end of our past, and the beginning of a bright future. The Empire has returned, and together, friends, we shall lead Griffonia into a new golden age. An age of peace and prosperity!"
 imperial.45.a:0 "Long Live the Emperor! Long live the Empire!"
 imperial.46.t:0 "Industrial Development"
 imperial.46.d:0 "The members of the IAC, despite not being capable of getting enough state funding to fulfil the production goals set for them by the Crown, have decided to use money out of their own pockets to fund the construction of several new factories around the Empire."
 imperial.46.a:0 "How nice of them."
 imperial.47.t:0 "Railroad Construction"
 imperial.47.d:0 "The IAC has recently decided to set aside a certain amount of their budget to construct several new railways to both connect the Empire and increase our industrial production."
 imperial.47.a:0 "More trains are good. I like trains."
 imperial.48.t:0 "Scandal Within the Palace"
 imperial.48.d:0 "The Noble Advisory Council, founded by the Imperial Regent, was created to both raise and advise the young Emperor Grover, as well as govern the nation while he matures. Certain members have been using their spots on the council to advance their social position or increase their own wealth. However, many of our citizens expect the nobility to be at least somewhat corrupt. Even still, it is hard to ignore, let alone tolerate an orgy within the imperial palace between multiple members of the council. The press, naturally, had a field day. The local authorities and witnesses... not so much."
 imperial.48.a:0 "The Aristocracy!"
 imperial.49.t:0 "Noble Deeds"
 imperial.49.d:0 "As of recently, the Noble Advisory Council has been doing their job with unusually little corruption or indecency. While we don't know the reason for this change of policy, our citizens are satisfied with the current situation. For now."
 imperial.49.a:0 "That's new."
 imperial.50.t:0 "The Knights of Arcturius"
 imperial.50.d:0 "Ever since we gave both funding and support to the Knights of Arcturius, they have been working tirelessly to improve the nation in any way they can. This has manifested itself in many ways, from building schools to repairing temples and more recently building their own paramilitary organisations. While these so called Squires are officially trainee knights they more or less fulfil the role of the Order's personal military police. This has increased support for the Imperial Regent and the Council of Three, but needless to say it has left some of our citizens slightly worried."
 imperial.50.a:0 "The innocent have nothing to fear."
 imperial.51.t:0 "Alms for the Poor"
 imperial.51.d:0 "Since State Eleos has been restored by the Archonate of Eyr, both the Archons and the few pious amongst the nobility have been working tirelessly on improving the lives of the common griffon. These efforts have not gone unnoticed by our people, as support for the Council of Three and the Emperor is once more on the rise."
 imperial.51.a:0 "Great!"
 imperial.53.t:0 "The Maréchal and the Emperor"
 imperial.53.d:0 "Leonard Rodier the infamous Maréchal and one of Aquileia's greatest generals has decided to come before us. It is no secret that Rodier decided to leave his homeland after the Second Revolution due to his belief of Aquileia failing as a nation, thus he has come before us to offer his services to our nation in the hopes that he might one day return to his beloved homeland and liberate it from the Republicans and Communists that have overrun it."
 imperial.53.a:0 "Welcome aboard, now please take a shower."
 imperial.53.b:0 "Go away Rodier, no one likes you."
 imperial.55.t:0 "Griffonia Demands Servitude"
 imperial.55.d:0 "The Imperial Regent, perhaps feeling emboldened by his more recent successes has decided to issue us an ultimatum... Serve the Empire or be destroyed, needless to say this ominous message has caused quite a stir within our entire country, but the question remains what shall we do?"
 imperial.55.a:0 "Let them come!"
 imperial.55.b:0 "We can't hope to stand against them..."
 imperial.56.t:0 "Skyfall Does not Bend"
 imperial.56.d:0 "Perhaps somewhat predictably the government of Skyfall has decided to not bow down before us, how shall we respond?"
 imperial.56.a:0 "How cute, they think they have a choice."
 imperial.56.b:0 "But, I like their whiskey..."
 imperial.57.t:0 "Skyfall Submits"
 imperial.57.d:0 "Unexpectedly the government of Skyfall has decided to submit to our demands, bringing the second largest city in Griffonia back under our control with not a drop of blood spilled."
 imperial.57.a:0 "Install a friendly government, and watch the money pile up."
 imperial.58.t:0 "The Fate of Aquileia"
 imperial.58.d:0 "After a gruelling battle we have managed to finally defeat Aquileia, our biggest rival in Western Griffonia, however despite their defeat it seems that our issues in Aquileia are far from over. Marshal Rodier, perhaps emboldened by his role in helping defeat Aquileia has all but demanded that Aquileia become an autonomous region within our Empire, with himself at it's head. What shall we do?"
 imperial.58.a:0 "Let Rodier have his little playground."
 imperial.58.b:0 "You must be joking?"
 imperial.59.t:0 "The Aquileian Rebellion"
 imperial.59.d:0 "Betrayal! Marshal Rodier and his Aquileian brethren have risen up all across the former Kingdom and after kicking out our soldiers, declared an Aquileian State under the leadership of Rodier and his MPA lackeys, it seems that our Aquileian troubles have only just begun."
 imperial.59.a:0 "I want the bastard's head on a spike!"
 imperial.60.t:0 "Of Things That Never Happened"
 imperial.60.d:0 "An interesting book was published today, 'Of Things That Never Happened' by Barys Solartail follows the life of a character simply known as Ropshin, a Republican terrorist who has been ordered by his superiors to assassinate a Wingbardian noble. While the premise of the story is rather simple the writer focuses more on the character of Ropshin and his beliefs than the actual plot of the story, some critics have even pointed out that at times it feels as if the character and the writer are the same person. Nevertheless the book has been generally warmly received both by commoners and nobles alike."
 imperial.60.a:0 "Ropshin you say? Where have I heard that name before?"
 imperial.61.t:0 "The Empire Strikes Back"
 imperial.61.d:0 "For a long time now, politicians and military staff within [Root.GetName] have eyed the renewed Rise of the Griffonian Empire across the Sea with a great deal of dread. Today, their fears have been confirmed, at last. A formal Request was sent to [Root.GetLeader] by the Empire, in which is stated that our Land was once part of the imperial realm, and that it still belonged to the Empire nowadays. They demand our immediate submission to the Imperial Crown, and that we return our status back to that of a Colony of the Empire. This would effectively undo all our efforts of making ourselves a strong, independent Country. However, it is without a doubt that the Empire is a force to be reckoned with, once more. What is our reply?"
 imperial.61.a:0 "No! Never again!"
 imperial.61.b:0 "An Emperor does not bow to another Emperor! Charge!"
 imperial.61.c:0 "It's our only option..."
 imperial.62.t:0 "[From.GetName] does not bend!"
 imperial.62.d:0 "The fiendish fools over in [From.GetName] have had the audacity to refuse our rightful reclamation of Colonial soil. Very well. If they do not bend the knee voluntarily, we shall make them bleed until they do."
 imperial.62.a:0 "Have at them!"
 imperial.63.t:0 "[From.GetName] bends!"
 imperial.63.d:0 "Those spineless cowards over in [From.GetName] have finally seen reason, and have agreed to our demand. [From.GetLeader] has already requested an audience with the Regency Council, willing to resubmit to the Empire. Our old colonial possessions finally return to the fold."
 imperial.63.a:0 "A wise Choice!"
 imperial.64.t:0 "Perfect time to strike"
 imperial.64.d:0 "While we and [WNG.GetName] are at war with [GRW.GetName], it is the optimal time for us to declare war on [WNG.GetName] and reclaim the southern coast of Griffonia."
 imperial.64.a:0 "Forwards!"
 imperial.64.b:0 "Yes."
 imperial.64.c:0 "Not now."
 imperial.65.t:0 "The Republican Dream"
 imperial.65.d:0 "A few days ago, one of the most famous modern day authors in the Griffonian Empire, Friedrich Winger, released his newest Book called 'The Republican Dream'. In the book, Winger looks back at the Republican Revolution inside the Griffonian Empire. He makes an effort to not only teach history, but also attempts to show that some of the Republican thoughts were quite progressive for the time, and they could still be a valid and necessary addition to imperial society today. After harsh backlash from public, Winger once again clarified that he supports the Crown, and that he does not affiliate himself with the Republic in any way. The book has so far been a moderate success in the Empire itself, but saw even greater success in other Countries, such as Aquileia."
 imperial.65.a:0 "A surprisingly interesting read."
 imperial.65.b:0 "A load of potentially dangerous nonsense."
 imperial.66.t:0 "The Imperial Banquet"
 imperial.66.d:0 "The Imperial Banquet is an ancient Griffonian tradition that dates back to the glory days of the Empire. Every ten years, nobles from all corners of the Empire would assemble at the capital of Griffenheim to spend one - sometimes even two - joyful evenings together. This helped strengthen our ties with the many dukes and princes of the Empire, and allowed the Emperor to improve relations with them.\n\nThe next Banquet is scheduled in just a few weeks, but our court is unsure about the exact procedures. Considering our weakened hold over the continent, it is unsure whether we should invite only those nobles still loyal to the Empire, or whether we should extend a claw to all who once were under our banner as a sign of good will."
 imperial.66.a:0 "We don't dine with traitors!"
 imperial.66.b:0 "A grand feast for all!"
 imperial.67.t:0 "The Banquet"
 imperial.67.d:0 "The night went along smoothly. Carriage after carriage arrived in front of the Imperial Palace, the most important of which were greeted by the regent, [Root.GetLeader], and even young Grover VI himself. This banquet was quite clearly one of the smaller ones, and the mood seemed to be sour at first. Soon, however, the memories of old returned to our guests, and the celebrations began. Games were played, words were exchanged, jokes were made. At the start of the Great Feast, the Duchess made a great speech. She spoke of ages long passed, and how it was the Empire's duty to carry on and reclaim its legacy and destiny. In the end, three cheers were had for our young Emperor."
 imperial.67.a:0 "We've made our resolve clear."
 imperial.68.t:0 "An Invitation"
 imperial.68.d:0 "A messenger from [From.GetNameDef] has just reached the court of [Root.GetLeader], delivering a formal invitation from [From.GetLeader]. It appears that despite our rivalry with the Empire, [Root.GetLeader] has been invited to the Imperial Banquet over in Griffenheim, an ancient griffon tradition that dates back over one hundred years. Many a dozen nobles have been invited, and we could use this opportunity to - just for one night - forget our differences and grudges with the Imperials."
 imperial.68.a:0 "It's all in good spirit, I suppose..."
 imperial.68.b:0 "We don't dine with Imperial Scum!"
 imperial.69.t:0 "The Banquet"
 imperial.69.d_vassals_only:0 "Once a grand assembly of Griffonian nobility, the Banquet was a rather awkward experience for all. Only the few loyal nobles arrived to join us and celebrate, and the grand Imperial Palace has never seemed this empty. The Regent and young Grover VI also attended the Banquet, and tried to improve relations with the few nobles that showed up, but it was a quiet, uneventful and awkward night, nonetheless. The once Grand Feast at the end of the Banquet was nothing more but a reminder of how large and powerful the Empire once was, as the vast majority of the room remained unfilled."
 imperial.69.a:0 "At least we kept the traitors out..."
 imperial.69.d_few:0 "The last night made for a rather disappointing and poor sight. Of the many nobles that were invited, only a small fraction decided to accept.[Root.GetGRIMajorsInvite] [Root.GetLeader] and young Grover VI attended as well, and attempted to lighten the mood in the rather empty-looking halls of the Imperial Palace. The Grand Feast marked the end of the celebrations, and yet many places on the table remained empty. The Regent thanked everygriff that showed up, and cursed all of those that remained home under their breath."
 imperial.69.b:0 "Shouldn't have invited them, after all."
 imperial.69.d_most:0 "The last night was a night of pomp and old glory. Many of the invited nobles made up their minds and accepted our good will.[Root.GetGRIMajorsInvite] The great halls of the Imperial Palace were filled with Nobility, truly reminding many of the old days of the Empire, and even bringing back nostalgia to some. The mood was light and joyful, and after some time even the deepest of grudges were forgotten about. The Grand Feast marked the end of the Banquet, and [Root.GetLeader] held a brilliant speech in which they thanked all visitors for their attendance and cooperation. During all the political rivalry and turmoil on the continent, the Banquet showed us that there can be peace between all of us, yet."
 imperial.69.c:0 "A spark of old glory!"
 imperial.69.d_all:0 "The Nobility on this continent appears to have seen reason and our good will, and all of them went ahead and accepted our invitation. Carriage after carriage they arrived at the Imperial Palace in Griffenheim, being greeted by the young Grover VI and [Root.GetLeader]. Among those nobles were loyalist as well as 'traitors', and even old rivals.[Root.GetGRIMajorsInvite] The mood was a bit shaky at the start, but the ice was soon broken, and old time grudges were forgotten in favour of light-hearted jokes and conversations. It seems that between all of the Griffonian politics, everygriff used this night to simply enjoy the company of each other. Even better, during the Grand Feast at the end of the celebrations, young Grover, with the support of the Regent, held a speech in front all of our guests, announcing his deep thanks to all of them, and stating that this night, if anything, is a sign that peace in Griffonia, between all of us, is possible, after all. We are griffons, in the end. The guests raised their mugs and cheered, and the Feast began."
 imperial.69.e:0 "What a great night!"
 imperial.70.t:0 "The Griffonian Empire Demands Their Land"
 imperial.70.d:0 "The Griffonian Empire is a re-emerging force in the world, and securing an alliance with them was no doubt a good idea. But, as is common with empires, they do have a tendency to claim a lot of territories they have no direct control over. The Empire has formally requested that we transfer control of territories they deem to be theirs over to them. While the loss of this territory is not the most optimal situation, the risk of angering the Empire might outweigh the loss, what will our response be?"
 imperial.70.a:0 "Transfer the lands over to the Empire, we can ill afford to anger them."
 imperial.70.b:0 "We cannot bow to such a ridiculous demand."
 imperial.71.t:0 "[From.GetName] Accepts Our Demands"
 imperial.71.d:0 "Fantastic news! Our wise [From.GetAdjective] allies have seen that our claims to the lands they hold are truly just, and as such have agreed to transfer control of them over to us. This is a great day for all griffons, as the Empire takes one more step towards unification."
 imperial.71.a:0 "Great!"
 imperial.72.t:0 "[From.GetName] Refuses Our Demands"
 imperial.72.d:0 "Our "allies" in [From.GetName] have proven themselves unwilling to recognize our rightful dominion over the lands they hold, and have denied our request of a territorial transfer. Is it truly right to call them our allies if they deny us this request?"
 imperial.72.a:0 "No, they are not our allies anymore. They are our enemies."
 imperial.73.t:0 "The Barrack Revolt"
 imperial.73.d:0 "Ferdinand Dawnfeather sat in his office, located in one of the innumerable military bases that dotted the capital of the Griffonian Empire. Ferdinand considered himself a patriot, and in a sense that was true. He did love the Empire in his own, strange, way. And it was precisely because of that love that he had to rebel. In his mind, the Empire simply couldn't survive without a radical change in the status quo. Could an already weakened Empire survive with a mere child in charge, with the nobles circling around him like vultures?\n\nNo, something had to be done. Ferdinand knew that his chances of success were slim, and that he would most likely just go down in history as another nameless traitor to the Empire, a fool whose futile rebellion was quickly crushed. Reports started to trickle in, his forces were converging on the Imperial palace, and soon they would face the palace guard in direct combat. Ferdinand could do nothing but wait, and hope that his soldiers could match the ferocity of the hardened defenders that they now faced. The next few minutes would decide the fate of the entire Empire and by extension the course of history itself."
 imperial.73.a:0 "The revolt is crushed"
 imperial.73.b:0 "The soldiers storm the Palace!"
 imperial.74.t:0 "The Storming of the Palace"
 imperial.74.d:0 "Against all odds, the few units that Ferdinand commanded triumphed over the palace guard, at the cost of heavy casualties. Ferdinand himself soon followed his soldiers into the palace, accompanied by his personal guard. What followed was brutal room to room combat, the defenders of the palace determined to protect the Emperor to the last. But Ferdinand's units eventually overwhelmed them, as the palace defenders fell one by one to a storm of steel and fire. And when the final guards fell, after hours of fighting, Ferdinand achieved complete control of the Imperial palace.\n\nHis soldiers soon set to fortifying the perimeter around the palace, preparing to defend it against any counter attacks. With Ferdinand now controlling the heart of the Empire, it was time for the next phase of his plan to unfold. In a radio address to the entire Reichspakt, he declared himself Lord Protector of the Empire and announced that a new government would take control of the state, until the rot that had infested it could be cleared out. Ferdinand now had to execute the part of his plan that he had been dreading the most, but that didn’t make it any less necessary."
 imperial.74.a:0 "Long live the Lord Protector!"
 imperial.75.t:0 "Securing Our Power"
 imperial.75.d:0 "Ferdinand Dawnfeather stood before the entrance of the Child-Emperor’s room. He knew what he had to do, the terrible act that he would commit to secure his power. The Emperor had no real authority, he was merely a figurehead, a pawn to be used by the various political factions that infested the rotting corpse of the once-great Empire. The child had to be removed from the picture if the Empire was to survive. And yet, he found himself unable to open the door, something deep in the back of his mind prevented him from doing so. Would this unforgivable act really be worth it?\n\nCommitting such an act would surely anger the entire Empire. Even the gods themselves would despise him for his actions. Was saving the Empire truly worth it? Would it be worth the weight of such an evil act? He struggled with himself for minutes, and with each second that passed by, he felt as if a noose was tightening around his neck. Finally, after what seemed like hours to the self-declared ruler of the Empire, he made up his mind. As he opened the door, a small part of him silently prayed for forgiveness. A larger part salivated at the thought of the power he would soon possess.\n\nThe act was relatively quick, and Ferdinand soon emerged from the Emperor's room. The part of the ‘Lord Protector’ that had sought forgiveness was gone and only the all-consuming desire for more power remained."
 imperial.75.a:0 "This world is too cruel to children..."
 imperial.76.t:0 "Unforeseen Consequences"
 imperial.76.d:0 "When the coup was initiated, its leaders had known that the wider Empire would most likely not react favourably. Such a massive shakeup in the status quo would most likely anger the various nobles that governed much of the Empire’s Heartlands, and they would no doubt make demands for increased autonomy and other privileges. But Ferdinand Dawnfeather himself had predicted that the vassals of the Empire would fall in line one after another, as surely their loyalty to the Spirit of the Empire was greater than their loyalty to some puppet Emperor. Ferdinand would simply meet with the various nobles and archons that held true power within Griffonia, and work out a deal that would benefit both parties. That had been the plan, but it seems that the leaders of the coup had been somewhat... optimistic about the state of the Griffonian Empire. Quickly after the coup was finished, and the emperor dead, something unexpected happened to the Empire.\n\nNamely the fact that it stopped existing. As it turns out, the second that the news of the Emperor's death reached the various vassal states, they all decided that they could not recognize the Lord Protector’s authority over themselves, and thus had no choice but to declare their independence. All in all, the only territory of the Empire that the Lord Protector "Controlled" was the Imperial City and the surrounding countryside. And judging by the mobs forming in the streets, that control might not last long.\n\nMay the gods save us."
 imperial.76.a:0 "Well shit..."
 imperial.77.t:0 "Panic in the War Room"
 imperial.77.d:0 "The headquarters of the newly established Regierung der Nationalen Rettung could, at the very best, be described as unorganized. Located inside one of the buildings of the former Imperial palace, the headquarters were hastily established by the new government after it became clear that the rest of the Empire was less than accepting of their aims. Within the building, an old storage room now served as an ad-hoc war room, with the entirety of the high command loyal to the new government located there.\n\nThe room itself was, to put it bluntly, a chaotic mess. Discarded documents and notes littered the floor, the walls were covered with war plans that had been drafted, re-drafted, adjusted, drawn over, and discarded multiple times over the course of the coup. Ferdinand himself was pacing around the room, with the various generals still loyal to him drafting up more plans and communicating with the other loyalist forces dotted around the city. The coup had been executed several days ago, and none of them had received any amount of sleep that could be called reasonable. Nevertheless, either through sheer desperation or a flash of brilliance they came up with a plan, and Ferdinand had every intention of acting upon it."
 imperial.77.a:0 "At least we have a plan now..."
 imperial.78.t:0 "Rifles At the Ready"
 imperial.78.d:0 "With the city growing more chaotic by the day, many thought that the days of the military junta were numbered. It seemed as if the mobs demanding the head of Ferdinand on a pike grew larger every day. And with the knightly orders and the remnants of the emperor's personal guard still lurking in the city, Griffenheim more resembled a powderkeg next to a lit torch than a city.  The few infantry units loyal to Ferdinand and his government left in Griffenheim now face a daunting task, managing the mobs with the meager supplies they have left until reinforcements from the countryside arrived to relive them.\n\nEvery single bullet and bayonet was rationed, with some patrols being forced to leave without ammunition in their guns, relying on intimidation to do all the fighting for them. The odds of survival seemed slim for Ferdinand and his young junta, and only a stroke of luck would allow him to survive the coming storm."
 imperial.78.a:0 "Just have to keep calm..."
 imperial.79.t:0 "The Battle For Griffenheim"
 imperial.79.d:0 "Ever since the coup was executed and the Emperor well... executed, the capital of Griffenheim has been engulfed in utter anarchy. Roving bands of rioters, supported by the remains of the royal guard, patrolled the streets of the city. Soldiers loyal to the new government frequently clashed with these bands, and it was not unusual for several patrols to disappear over the course of a day, their broken bodies eventually found in some dark alleyway, stripped of all weapons and equipment.\n\nThe days went on, and the soldiers of the coup were gradually whittled down to a shadow of their former force. The streets eventually became too dangerous for patrols and ever since, the remaining loyalists have been sitting in their fortified headquarters, waiting for other units loyal to Ferdinand to make their way to the capital. As rations and ammo slowly ran out for the defenders, many took to desertion, hoping to save their skin, but they soon found out that the mobs outside were in a less than forgiving mood.\n\nBut after 67 days had passed, the promised help finally arrived. Rows of trucks and tanks entered the city, and the roving mobs discovered that force of will tended to dissipate against concentrated automatic gunfire. With the streets finally under their control, the new government could finally start cementing their rule over Griffenheim."
 imperial.79.a:0 "Now back to business!"
 imperial.80.t:0 "Panzers in the Streets"
 imperial.80.d:0 "While the majority of the rebels in the capital had been suppressed when the reinforcements had arrived, the people of the city were still far from accepting the authority of the government. This was only worsened due to the incredible rise in crime across the city, with many gangs seeing the coup as the perfect opportunity to rob and kill as they pleased. The gangs gradually split the capital between themselves, with many fortifying buildings and streets of the city to serve as headquarters for their operations.\n\nTo worsen this, protesters carrying images of the old emperor were still common amongst the city. With some openly weeping and declaring their undying hatred of Ferdinand himself. It was clear that something had to be done, and luckily this situation presented the perfect opportunity to investigate how capable tanks were at suppressing urban populations.\n\nThe petty strongholds of the gangs were simply blown up by the cannons of the tanks, with the survivors being crushed underneath their treads. The protesters were commanded to stop, and when they proved unwilling to do so, the machine guns of the tanks proved very capable at persuading them to change their minds. At the end of the week, the city was completely under the control of the government, and the captured traitors could only wait for their eventual punishment."
 imperial.80.a:0 "That's going to be a pain to clean up..."
 imperial.81.t:0 "The Day of the Rope"
 imperial.81.d:0 "With the capital firmly under the control of the new government, a day of reckoning had arrived. The few surviving traitors were marched to the public square of the palace in chains, where the population of the capital could see what fate was in store for those who dared to betray the Empire. Ferdinand himself delivered the sentence and for a crime as grievous as high treason, there was only one punishment appropriate punishment. The criminals were sentenced to death by hanging, with the sentence to be carried out the very same day.\n\nA few hours later every citizen of Griffenheim could see what would happen should they dare resist their new leaders. The bodies of the old, the young, the sick and the healthy, men and women alike, no one was spared from the rope."
 imperial.81.a:0 "I rather fancy Griffenheim's new decorations..."
 imperial.82.t:0 "The Knights"
 imperial.82.d:0 "The Knights of Griffonkind were truly figures from myth given flesh, each one showed exemplary dedication to the higher ideals of chivalry and honour, and each one would fight with a shocking ferocity once confronted on the battlefield. Sadly, their sense of honour and chivalry proved their undoing, as the new government proved to be incompatible with these ideals. They had repeatedly made their problems with the new government clear, and in doing so had earned the label of traitors.\n\nThe Knights knew that they stood no chance and that they would most likely die useless deaths, and yet they still resolved to fight with all their power. At dawn, they marched against the headquarters of the new government, with the aim of capturing and killing Ferdinand Dawnfeather. The group which marched that day numbered almost a thousand, with many more across the nation waiting to strike. None would survive to the day's end.\n\nIn the end, they charged the defences of the headquarters, facing automatic weapons and armoured vehicles, and were cut down to the last. The time of chivalry and honour was over, only the grim reality of modern war remained."
 imperial.82.a:0 "Where is your God now?"
 imperial.83.t:0 "The Attempt"
 imperial.83.d:0 "The Knights of Griffonkind were truly figures from myth given flesh, each one showed exemplary dedication to the higher ideals of chivalry and honour, and each one would fight with a shocking ferocity once confronted on the battlefield.

 imperial.84.t:0 "The Army Purge"
 imperial.84.d:0 "With the army now firmly under the control of the Regierung der Nationalen Rettung, the time had come to separate the wheat from the chaff as they say. The process itself was fairly simple, each soldier was asked of his opinion of the new government, those who answered disapprovingly, or had family members or close friends who did the same, were quickly singled out. They were then walked out to the firing line and shot, their bodies pushed into a mass grave, and said grave filled with cement.\n\nWhile some may suggest that our methods were crude and inefficient, the simplicity and effectiveness of a bullet to the head cannot be denied when it comes to dealing with traitors. This action was, however, considered very barbaric amongst the officer core, with Elias Bronzetail leading said officers. They had to be dealt with in short order."
 imperial.84.a:0 "They got only what they deserved."
 imperial.85.t:0 "The Death of Elias Bronzetail"
 imperial.85.d:0 "While dealing with the dissent of the common soldier is a simple, if brutal task, the treatment of officers is a far more sensitive matter. A large number of officers, led by Elias Bronzetail, have declared their open disgust at the conduct of the government and demanded better treatment. The rebelling officers demanded that their treatment be fitting to their status and that we accept their rights to hold whatever private opinions on the government that they wanted to hold.\n\nThis, of course, was treachery of the highest order, and the only punishment befitting such a crime was death by the noose. The offending officers were all rounded up, and over the course of an hour hanged within view of each other. One of the last ones to die was Elias Bronzetail, with his death being personally overseen by Ferdinand."
 imperial.85.a:0 "Thus unto traitors."
 imperial.86.t:0 "No More Nobles"
 imperial.86.d:0 "The nobility of the Empire had always been allowed more freedom of expression than the common folk, with the incredible amount of power they wielded necessitating such concessions from previous governments. Once the new government took over, they simply assumed that they would be able to get away with it as they always had. They constantly petitioned Ferdinand himself with requests of old rights and petty disputes, and some even demanded the creation of a noble council to ‘advise’ the new government on the proper ways of controlling a state.\n\nUnfortunately for the nobles, Ferdinand was not a griffon know for leniency to those who annoy him. So, he announced the creation of the noble council and asked every prominent noble within his territory to come to one of the towers of the imperial palace to discuss the powers of this council. However, when they arrived at the tower, the only thing they found a bullet to the back of the head, and a quick descent downwards from the window of the tower.\n\nNeedless to say, the nobles will not be a problem anymore."
 imperial.86.a:0 "They didn't fly so good."
 imperial.87.t:0 "Archon No More"
 imperial.87.d:0 "With Eros surviving the previous attempt on his life, his popularity and influence only increased. The government made several new plans to deal with him, each one more complex and detailed than the last. Poisoned food, explosives, yet another sniper. Pretty much every possible option was considered, and while these plans were discussed, Eros continued to spread his message. The problem had progressed to the point that a revolution by his supporters seemed inevitable, and the eighth delay of the assassination proved to be the last straw for Ferdinand.\n\nHe grabbed his revolver and a squadron of his personal guard and drove off in his car. He arrived at the Archon’s house and proceeded to kick the door in. Then he and his men meticulously killed every single occupant of the house, until Eros himself was located. Ferdinand was the one who took the final shot, and it is said that it was one of the few moments in his life where he had smiled.\n\nAt the end of the day, the archon was dealt with, and Ferdinand learned that direct methods often surpassed complex ones, provided they were executed with finesse and skill."
 imperial.87.a:0 "Say hello to Boreas for me would you?"
 imperial.88.t:0 "The End of the Anarchy"
 imperial.88.d:0 "With the last of his internal enemies dead at his feet, Ferdinand Dawnfeather has seemingly accomplished the impossible and survived the anarchy that consumed the Empire ever since his coup. Griffenheim now lies firmly under his control, and the surrounding countryside has been occupied by his forces. The Griffonian Empire may be an empire in name only, but it is an empire that Ferdinand now fully controls.\n\nBut Ferdinand was by no means satisfied by the meager parcel of territory he currently controlled, and he had every intention of restoring the Empire to its former glory, and perhaps even beyond. Every single pathetic traitor, every rebellious lord would be defeated and executed for their crimes, no less would do to satisfy the Empires new ruler. The Empires military now prepare for a military campaign that aims to recapture the entire continent and ensure that the Imperial flag once more flies across all of Griffonia once and for all."
 imperial.88.a:0 "Long live the Lord Protector!"
 imperial.89.t:0 "The War Against Illiteracy Begins"
 imperial.89.d:0 "An illiterate soldier is a useless soldier, and it remains a sad fact that the majority of the griffons within the Empire are barely educated beyond the most basic schooling imaginable. If the Empire is to reclaim its glory, and more importantly its territory, then this issue must be rectified at once. A comprehensive course aimed at getting every able-bodied griffon up to basic literacy in the shortest amount of time possible has already been drafted, and teachers across the nation are being rounded up to enforce this new curriculum. Attendance is strongly encouraged, and refusal to attend the classes without a very good reason is rarely met with a great amount of understanding from the police. "
 imperial.89.a:0 "Good"
 imperial.90.t:0 "The War Continues"
 imperial.90.d:0 "The war against illiteracy continues to progress at a steady pace. Ever since the new classes aimed at bringing the adult population up to literacy were set up, the amount of griffons able to read has begun to slowly rise. And with the help of the army, the populace is slowly beginning to learn the true value that lies in knowing how to read. The war is not over, not by a long shot, but we have made a truly prodigious amount of progress in such a short timespan."
 imperial.90.a:0 "An educated griffon can conquer the world"
 imperial.91.t:0 "The War is Almost Won"
 imperial.91.d:0 "The fight against illiteracy within the Empire has made great strides, and the majority of adult griffons now possess at least some level of skill at reading and writing. Thanks to the strictly enforced new curriculum, more and more griffons are joining the army as well, with each course filled to the brim with inspiring tales of the heroic soldiers of the empire. The battle against illiteracy is not over, but the beast may very well have received a mortal blow."
 imperial.91.a:0 "Wonderful"
 imperial.92.t:0 "Victory!"
 imperial.92.d:0 "Thanks to the wise policies of the Lord Protector, as well as the incredible dedication of his subjects, the curse of illiteracy no longer lies upon the Griffonian Empire. The educational campaign has been a truly astounding success, and the benefits of it are being felt at every level of Imperial society. The great war against illiteracy is over at long last, and we can now focus our attention on more pressing matters."
 imperial.92.a:0 "At long last!"
 imperial.93.t:0 "The Return Of the Slaves"
 imperial.93.d:0 "In a rather unexpected move, the Griffonian empire has seemingly decided to return our slaves that fled to their lands many years ago. This came as a rather large surprise, as the Griffonian Empire has never shown any inclination towards such an action before. Perhaps it has something to do with the recent change in leadership within the empire. But who are we to refuse such a boon? \n\nPlans regarding the use of the new slaves are already being drafted, though the weaklings amongst them must first be weeded out, a straightforward task. If they will not work, then they will at least provide some amusement before their death. "
 imperial.93.a:0 "Well then... that's quite a surprise"
 imperial.94.t:0 "The Death of the President-Marshal"
 imperial.94.d:0 "President-Marshal Kermerskai was executed by firing squad in the imperial square in Griffenheim today. The people had anticipated this day ever since his capture at the hands of an elite griffon special forces unit during the fall of the bandit state known as the Griffonian Republic, and the crowd at the execution itself was truly massive. There was no trial given to Kermerskai, with the government stating that his crimes were so blatant and irrefutable that dignifying them with a trial would be akin to spitting on the very concept of justice. Any griffon who disagreed with this statement quickly changed his mind or was arrested as a Republican sympathizer.\n\nKermerskai was marched to a wall and offered a blindfold and cigarette, both of which he refused. The execution itself occurred mere seconds later and was closely observed by Ferdinand himself, with some saying that he had personally given the order to fire on the president-marshal. Whatever the case may be, the Griffonian republican movement received a devastating blow today, one that it is unlikely to recover from."
 imperial.94.a:0 "We finally got him"
 imperial.95.t:0 "Griffonstone Repaired"
 imperial.95.d:0 "Celebrations were held in Griffonstone today, commemorating the completion of the Imperial restoration program recently launched by the government at the behest of the Lord Protector. The birthplace of griffonkind had truly seen better days before its reconquest by the Empire, as years of neglect had reduced the venerable city to nothing more than a glorified town in the midst of collapsing. When the Lord Protector saw the sorry state of the city with his own eyes, he declared that the birthplace of griffonkind could not stay in such a state if the Empire was to control it, and mere days later work had started on restoring the city to its former glory.\n\nThe Lord Protector himself gave a rousing speech at the ceremony, decreeing that Griffonstone was a model of the many benefits that Imperial rule brought to the people of Griffonia, and declared that as long as he lived the city would not fall to such a low state ever again. The residents of the city were particularly appreciative of the efforts taken by the Lord Protector, and hundreds of the cities residents volunteered to join the Imperial army once the festivities were over."
 imperial.95.a:0 "I rather like Griffenheim"

 imperial.96.t:0 "The End of A Dynasty"
 imperial.96.d:0 "Prince Heavenly Snow, a popular figure in Lake City and the descendant of Blessed Sword, has served as something of a symbol for resistance against our rule in Lake City, with many resistance members rallying to restore him to his rightful place as the ruler of Lake City. This situation could not be tolerated any longer, so today Heavenly Snow was publicly executed in the middle of Jezeragrad.\n\nWe will make it absolutely clear that anypony who dares resist our rightful rule over Lake City will receive the same fate, and that only by accepting their rightful place as vassals of the Empire can the ponies move on from their pathetic defeat. And if they are unable to learn this lesson themselves, we will simply force it upon them."

 imperial.99.t:0 "A Traitor's Death"
 imperial.99.d:0 "Ferdinand Dawnfeather, one of the Empire's more recent traitors, was publicly executed in the capital today, with the event drawing little attention from the rest of the Empire. Ever since attempting a failed coup several days ago, the griffon had simply awaited his fate. Once the time finally came to lay judgment down on him, no leniency was taken and he was found guilty of high treason as well as conspiracy to commit regicide. There was only one punishment worthy of such evils, and he was sentenced to be hung from the gallows at dawn.\n\nThe griffon offered no defense for himself, staying silent through the entire court case, seemingly having accepted his fate. The execution itself was a subdued event, with a scant few military officials and curious onlookers showing up. Of the few griffons present at the event, Elias Bronzetail was the most senior in rank, showing up out of the little respect that he had for the foolish general. There were no grand speeches or denunciations at the execution, Ferdinand was simply lead up to the gallows, and minutes later he hung dead in the air.\n\nIn the end, Ferdinand Dawnfeather died a mundane death, one which was observed by few. He would be a footnote in history, another mad general driven by a lust for power, an insignificant traitor whose pitiful rebellion was put down before it could even start in earnest.\n\nIt was a fitting end."

 GRI_skyfall_dock:0 "A New Home Port"
 GRI_skyfall_dock_desc:0 "The City of Skyfall has been reclaimed for the Empire, and with it, the great Skyfall Docks have also returned to the fold. As the largest dock in Griffonia, it will serve us well in this new age."
 GRI_griffonian_marines:0 "The Seebataillon"

 GRI_transport_f:0 "Better Landing Craft"
 GRI_transport_f_desc:0 "To ensure the continued success of naval invasions onto foreign soil, we must make sure that we can fit as many able-bodied griffons onto our landing craft as possible. More numbers means there is a higher chance of success, plain and simple."

 GRI_infantry_equipment_f_desc:0 "Our muskets of old are getting to the point of uselessness due to modern military doctrines. If we have any hope to keep up with our neighbours, we must modernise. New, shinier, and more importantly, deadlier guns are in order."
 GRI_support_equipment_f:0 "Clean Bandages"
 GRI_support_equipment_f_desc:0 "We need to reconsider our stance on how we treat our wounded. Quite frankly, our "battlefield doctors" are terrible, and this is getting more griffons killed out of battle than in battle. We urgently need to fix this problem."
 GRI_artillery_f:0 "Bigger Guns"
 GRI_artillery_f_desc:0 "Not only do we need better guns, but larger guns as well. The age of cannons has passed, and the thunder of artillery will make our enemy tremble before us."
 GRI_light_tank_f:0 "Armoured Tractors"
 GRI_light_tank_f_desc:0 "A couple enterprising griffons have approached us with the idea to slap armoured plates onto a tractor, like a large piece of armour plating. While this particular model doesn't pose much of a threat, perhaps such a new type of vehicle could be of good use?"

 GRI_doctrine_grand_battlepan_desc:0 "Bronzetail believes that we should make our defensive positions so unassailable that the enemy either does not go forward, or does so with unacceptable casualties. Perhaps this is the military focus we should follow, his patent pending name aside."
 GRI_support_equipment_f_but_better:0 "Nachrichten-Versuchskommando"
 GRI_support_equipment_f_but_better_desc:0 "With a dedicated messaging service for our military, we can ensure that messages are relayed correctly and in time. This will aid our frontline units and general staff equally."

August believes we should focus on massing as much firepower as possible, as often as possible, so as to break our enemies as quickly as possible, with as little loss of our own lives as we can. Perhaps we should make this our main military focus."
 GRI_infantry_equipment_f_but_better:0 "Modern Firearms"
 GRI_infantry_equipment_f_but_better_desc:0 "While our old weapons have served us well in the past, it's time to catch up to the world. These new rifles are a far cry from our old muskets and bayonets, and will take some time to learn to use properly, but the updated designs are highly important in keeping us on the edge of technology."
 GRI_motorized_f:0 "Armoured Cars and Trucks"

 GRI_mobile_warfare_focus_desc:0 "Thundertail believes that the way to win our wars is to attack as fast as possible, with as much power as we can without sacrificing our rapid advance. Thus, we overtake our enemies before they are able to realise we’re right on top of them. Perhaps we should make this our main military focus?"
 GRI_light_tank_fs:0 "Proper Tanks"
 GRI_light_tank_fs_desc:0 "With the success of our tractor experiments, it is time to fully develop the "tank", as it's being called, and turn it into a proper weapon of war, rather than a hodgepodged prototype. Standardisation and upgraded designs are in order, as soon as possible."
 GRI_medium_tank:0 "Heavier Tanks"

 GRI_spec_ops_initiative_desc:0 "The imperial army might have come a long way, thus far, but we still lack dedicated special forces within our ranks. It's about time we introduced these troops, as they will aid us in conquering even the most difficult territories of Griffonia."

 GRI_rocket_artillery_f_but_better_desc:0 "The Nebelwerfer is a rocket launcher that launches incendiary grenades in a high arc towards enemy positions.

 GRI_project_arcturus_desc:0 "Arcturius, your fierce-hearted sons call for your aid, oh full-famed god of war. To you do soldiers pray when battle is most heated, when mettle is most needed.

 GRI_air_superior:0 "Battlefield Support Doctrine"
 GRI_air_superior_desc:0 "A mobile and agile wing of dive bombers is ideal for our air force, as it enables us to support our ground forces anywhere on the battlefield rapidly and precisely. With solid, precise air support, no offense or defense can stand in our way!"
 GRI_operational_integrit:0 "Operational Integrity Doctrine"
 GRI_operational_integrit_desc:0 "To support both defensive and offensive maneuvers on the ground, our air force must prove itself dominant over the enemy's aerial forces. Only if we can wrest control over the skies will our troops be safe, and only then can victory be ensured."
 GRI_expand_airbases:0 "Expand the Imperial Airbases"
 GRI_expand_airbases_desc:0 "The Empire is in dire need of new, expanded air bases. Without them, we are unable to utilise any of our air power. We must construct new bases at once!"

 GRI_close_air_support_focus:0 "Supporting Our Troops"
 GRI_close_air_support_focus_desc:0 "Our close air support must always be on stand-by, ready to aid our ground forces whenever needed. That way, no defense and no offense can be broken, and our victory is ensured."

 GRI_fighter_focus:0 "Wings of Steel"
 GRI_fighter_focus_desc:0 "A strong air force naturally relies on a strong fighter presence. Without good, reliable fighter models, we might as well scrap the idea of aerial supremacy altogether. We must ensure that we possess the most modern design schemes for our fighters at all times!"
 GRI_heavy_fighter_focus:0 "Beaks of Steel"
 GRI_heavy_fighter_focus_desc:0 "Even stronger, but also heavier versions of our fighters would aid us in maintaining aerial supremacy. With more and bigger guns, these machines could easily destroy whatever the enemy throws at us."

 GRI_calm_the_fuck_down:0 "Please Send Help"
 GRI_calm_the_fuck_down_desc:0 "Ferdinand has sent out a call for assistance to the few units loyal to him outside the city. The message itself calls on them to make their way to Griffenheim very fast, and to make ready for combat once they arrive. Hopefully, they will arrive soon. If they do not arrive, well then we might as well shoot ourselves now to save the firing line some bullets."
 GRI_secure_the_streets:0 "Panzers on the Streets"
 GRI_secure_the_streets_desc:0 "With our reinforcements finally having arrived and Griffenheim firmly in our hands the time has come to enforce order on the streets.

 GRI_hang_them_high:0 "Corpses On the Lamp Posts"
 GRI_hang_them_high_desc:0 "It seems that the citizens of Griffenheim have not fully learned their lesson. When gentler methods fail, harsher ones are called for. And the methods we can use are very harsh indeed."

 GRI_a_bullet_for_the_priests_desc:0 "The Knights of the empire have apparently not gotten it through their skulls that we are in charge.

 GRI_a_message:0 "With a Message"
 GRI_a_message_desc:0 "A certain griffon has been a thorn in our side ever since the coup. He does possess a large amount of influence within the empire, and moving against him will certainly be difficult. But if he cannot accept the new status quo, then he must go. "
 GRI_traitors_within:0 "A Bullet For the Soldiers"
 GRI_traitors_within_desc:0 "The military has been pretty firmly split between those who support Ferdinand and those who are against it. Now, if we consider this from a legal perspective, if they refuse to accept the authority of the government then they refuse to accept the authority of the empire. That is quite clearly treason, and the punishment for treason is quite clear."
 GRI_what_they_deserve:0 "And a Noose For the Commanders"
 GRI_what_they_deserve_desc:0 "Now that the soldiers have been dealt with, the time has come for us to deal with the officers.

 GRI_kill_eros:0 "'Retire' Eros"

 GRI_ministry_of_propaganda:0 "Reichsministerium für Propaganda"
 GRI_ministry_of_propaganda_desc:0 "The press has never been an ally of the state, peddling vile rumors, and lies against the government at every turn.

 GRI_convert_the_factories_desc:0 "A large number of factories within the imperial city are dedicated to the production of pointless baubles and toys for the civilian population.

 GRI_military_industrial_council_desc:0 "Several prominent industrialists have been far more agreeable to our demands than the others, and such dedication and loyalty to the state should be rewarded.

 GRI_use_it_for_propaganda_desc:0 "Romau has been the center of higher learning in the Empire for generations and is generally regarded as a safe choice to base our research and development efforts out of.

 grover_v_desc:0 "Nominally the Emperor of all Griffonia, Grover V has had a difficult life. Never the most healthy of griffons, he has lost his father to a stroke, and with that, woe soon came to the Empire. The loss of the Idol of Boreas, the Republican Uprising of 978, millions of dead griffons - Grover could only watch and weep as the events unfolded. Nonetheless, the Emperor could count on his good friends, notably Archon Eros VII and Duchess Gabriella Eagleclaw, to keep him safe from the worst and guide him in ruling what remained of loyalists. An unifying force for the Heartlands, Grover has developed a sense of grim determination and does his best to maintain the Empire's legacy, regardless of his personal issues."
 eros_vii_desc:0 "One of the oldest living griffons, Archon Eros VII was born when the Empire was at the height of its power. At a young age, he joined the priesthood of Boreas out of genuine respect for the Gods. His pious devotion and humble manner has led him to quickly rise to the position of Archon, and all seemed well. Yet cruel fate had in store to render the Empire asunder, with the loss of the Idol of Boreas and the incompetent Council of Regents dragging the country to the ground. He was responsible for saving the young Grover V's life from the claws of Republican insurgents, and has maintained a close friendship with him ever since. This is why he protects the late Emperor's son, Grover VI, and hopes that once his regency is over, he will rule an unified Empire. Yet Eros has little love for the nobility of the Empire, believing them to be responsible for every misfortune that has plagued the Heartlands. And now, with the broad support of the commonfolk, Eros and his fellow Archons are attempting the restore the Empire's glory. The traitors and unbelievers will pay with their blood, Boreas wills it!"
 pink_birb_desc:0 "First cousin to the Emperor, Duchess Gabriella Eagleclaw is one of most powerful nobles in the Heartlands and Grover V's personal friend. Her charisma and force of personality, not to mention her sizable personal properties and wealth, has placed her in a position where she can command most of the petty lords. She has always championed for the cause of her peers, but she is not blind to the plight of the common griffon and wishes to introduce limited reforms to the system, genuinely wishing for the people to have a good life, proud of their country. All she does, she does it in honour of her friend, the late Emperor, and holds in contempt the Archons, believing that they'll ruin the country with their dangerously radical ideas. Until the Emperor's son is old enough to ascend to the throne, Gabriella balances her many responsiblities and leads the Empire to a new dawn."

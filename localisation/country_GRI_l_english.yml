 ### Imperial Events ###
 imperial.0.t:0 "Under a Blue Sky"
 imperial.0.d:0 "Republicans to the North, Aquileia to the West, Wingbardy to the South, Ippasia to the East and the aristocracy in the court... Enemies on all sides. The glory of our empire was once unmatched, our might unchallenged, our authority unquestioned. Times have changed, however... our empire is now but a shadow of its former self. Nobles and revolutionaries alike have broken our empire apart, turned it into 'the dying bird of Griffonia', as they call it. Additionally, our beloved emperor has fallen ill, with his only heir remaining underage and incapable of ruling the empire. Due to this, various nobles and lowborn are wondering who is going to take charge of the empire during the regency. The future of the empire, weaker than ever, is uncertain..."
 imperial.0.a:0 "Dark times are ahead..."
 imperial.1.t:0 "A Train Trip"
 imperial.1.d:0 "Despite his deteriorating health, the emperor has decided to embark on a trip through the empire via train, in order to showcase the new imperial railway system and, more importantly, convince the people that his days are not yet over. Reluctantly, after heavily protesting against the trip and arguing that he should stay in bed, the emperor's doctors let him go."
 imperial.1.a:0 "What's the worst that could happen?"
 imperial.2.t:0 "A Perfectly Normal Day"
 imperial.2.d:0 "All seemed to have been going well in court today as the Emperor met noble after noble, listening to their petty complaints, pretending to be listening to their pleas while trying to not fall asleep... until the Emperor collapsed without warning. He was quickly rushed to his private chambers and is currently being taken care of by the Empire's finest medical experts."
 imperial.2.a:0 "His days might be over, at last..."
 imperial.3.t:0 "The Emperor is Dead"
 imperial.3.d:0 "Unfortunately, after nearly a month of treatments and therapy, Emperor Grover the Fifth of his name was embraced by the claws of Boreas at the young age of 54. Due to his only son and heir Prince Grover VI not being of the age in which he is capable of ruling the country himself, a Regency Council consisting of Nobles, Merchant Princes and Church Officials shall take over the apparatus of state until a more suitable solution is found..."
 imperial.3.a:0 "Boreas save us all!"
 imperial.4.t:0 "On the Matter of the Regency"
 imperial.4.d:0 "The first real issue the Regency Council is facing is who exactly it should allow into the council itself. The nobility, lead by Duchess Gabriela Eagleclaw, has proposed that only those of high birth should be able to attend and vote upon matters of importance in the Council, which would effectively exclude the majority of both merchant princes and the various church officials from voting. What no one was expecting, however, was the various religious organisations within our country uniting under the banner of Archon Eros VII of the Borean Temple, and declaring that the entire council should not only be able to vote, but that they should also open the doors to influential commoners."
 imperial.4.a:0 "Only the Highborn shall vote!"
 imperial.4.b:0 "Open our Doors to the Commoners!"
 imperial.5.t:0 "On the Matter Commoner Rights"
 imperial.5.d:0 "The Second issue we face is: how exactly should the average commoner be treated within the Empire? The nobility, pompous as ever, has stated that those who live upon their land are their property and shall remain as such. On the other claw, Archon Eros has proposed that we gradually give rights to all Griffons, lowborn or not."
 imperial.5.a:0 "Power to the Aristocracy!"
 imperial.5.b:0 "Power to the People!"
 imperial.6.t:0 "The Great Betrayal"
 imperial.6.d:0 "After nearly a month since we managed to secure the Regency Council's support for our cause it seemed as if things were finally calming down in the Capital after all these initial power struggles. Unfortunately, we were proven wrong, as today, during a council meeting, Duchess Gabriela Eagleclaw and several allies of her simply left the room, followed by the lords of Bronzehill, Feathisia and Greifenheim. Hours later, they all announced their formal secession from the Empire..."
 imperial.6.a:0 "Traitors! Every Single one of them!"
 imperial.7.t:0 "The Sad Truth"
 imperial.7.d:0 "The sad truth is that we simply cannot hope to fight against Eros on our own. If we intend to survive this mess we must convince our fellow lords to work together. Only then will we be strong enough to stand up to Eros."
 imperial.7.a:0 "Send out the messengers"
 imperial.7.b:0 "We can fight Griffonia on our own, thank you very much"
 imperial.8.t:0 "An Invitation"
 imperial.8.d:0 "It seems that the Duchess has once again called upon us to assist her. She believes that none of the secessionist states can hope to stand up against the Archon and his lackeys alone, and that we are inclined to agree with her. Furthermore, she has proposed a formal alliance between our two nations."
 imperial.8.a:0 "We must work together"
 imperial.8.b:0 "We can take on the Archon on our own"
 imperial.9.t:0 "An Invitation"
 imperial.9.d:0 "It seems that the Duchess has once again called upon us to assist her. She believes that none of the secessionist states can hope to stand up against the Archon and his lackeys alone, and that we are inclined to agree with her. Furthermore, she has proposed a formal alliance between our two nations."
 imperial.9.a:0 "We must work together"
 imperial.9.b:0 "We can take on the Archon on our own"
 imperial.10.t:0 "An Invitation"
 imperial.10.d:0 "It seems that the Duchess has once again called upon us to assist her. She believes that none of the secessionist states can hope to stand up against the Archon and his lackeys alone, and that we are inclined to agree with her.

 imperial.10.a:0 "We must work together"
 imperial.10.b:0 "We can take on the Archon on our own"
 imperial.11.t:0 "Bronzehill Accepts"
 imperial.11.d:0 "The Lord of Bronzehill has decided to join the Griffonian Protection Alliance."
 imperial.11.a:0 "Great!"
 imperial.12.t:0 "Feathisia Accepts"
 imperial.12.d:0 "The Lord of Feathisia has decided to join the Griffonian Protection Alliance."
 imperial.12.a:0 "Fantastic!"
 imperial.13.t:0 "Greifenheim Accepts"
 imperial.13.d:0 "The Lord of Greifenheim has decided to join the Griffonian Protection Alliance."
 imperial.13.a:0 "Brilliant!"
 imperial.14.t:0 "An Offer"
 imperial.14.d:0 "It seems that after solidifying their position, the Council of Three has decided to end our autonomy without asking asking us or the Council for consent. While we could most likely veto this decision in the Regency Council and garner the support of what few of the nobility is left, chances are the Archons won't take no for an answer. How do we respond?"
 imperial.14.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept (Taking this option will result in a game over)"
 imperial.14.b:0 "To Tartarus with the Archons! Let them come! (Taking this option will most likely result in injury)"
 imperial.14.c:0 "We've got the situation under control"
 imperial.15.t:0 "An Offer"
 imperial.15.d:0 "It seems that after solidifying their position, the Council of Three has decided to end our autonomy without asking asking us or the Council for consent. While we could most likely veto this decision in the Regency Council and garner the support of what few of the nobility is left, chances are the Archons won't take no for an answer.

 imperial.17.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept"
 imperial.17.b:0 "To Tartarus with the Archons! Let them come!"
 imperial.18.t:0 "Romau Refuses"
 imperial.18.d:0 "It seems that the Burghers and Lords of Romau have decided to defy us. Needless to say, they made the wrong choice."
 imperial.18.a:0 "Oh well, no one can say we weren't diplomatic"
 imperial.18.b:0 "Let them be, we don't need them"
 imperial.19.t:0 "Yaledom Defies Us"
 imperial.19.d:0 "Graf Mikusian, always the one for theatrics, has decided to deny our little request. It seems that Yaledom must rejoin the empire by force."
 imperial.19.a:0 "Teach them the price of defiance"
 imperial.19.b:0 "Yaledom is of no importance to our future plans"
 imperial.20.t:0 "Katerin Defiance"
 imperial.20.d:0 "The Prince of Katerin and his legion of glorified hillbillies have once again proven to be idiots, as they've decided to not rejoin the Empire. Perhaps it's about time we show them the might of the empire."
 imperial.20.a:0 "Let's crack some skulls!"
 imperial.20.b:0 "The Empire doesn't need them anyways"
 imperial.21.t:0 "The Obvious Suspect"
 imperial.21.d:0 "To no one's surprise, our former ally in the Regency Council, the Baron of Angriver, has decided to defy us. While this was an expected result, it certainly won't stop us from taking what is rightfully ours."
 imperial.21.a:0 "Time to deal with Angriver once and for all"
 imperial.21.b:0 "Let him rot in his little Barony for all I care"
 imperial.22.t:0 "The Empire Strikes Back"
 imperial.22.d:0 "After a series of reforms, miraculous victories and countless rebellions, the long suffering Griffonian Empire has, under the guidance of the Council of Three, managed to reclaim the Griffonian Heartlands. While many of the still independent Griffon Kingdoms were hoping that the three Archons would be satisfied with the realm they've carved out for themselves, it seems that this will not be the case, as today Archon Eros VII, with his young protege Emperor Grover VI in tow, made a speech announcing that the Griffonian Empire shall not sit idle until all Griffons are united under the imperial banner once more"
 imperial.22.a:0 "A new Empire is on the rise..."
 imperial.23.t:0 "The Archon's Defiance"
 imperial.23.d:0 "After securing a victory for the Nobility in the Regency Council and alienating both the Eastern lords and the Archons, things were finally somewhat stabilising in the Imperial Capital. Until today that is. After a regular meeting, Archon Eros and Archon Proteus promptly denounced Duchess Gabriela and her allies as heathens and traitors, after which they both left the Capital. They were shortly afterwards joined by the Lord Protector of Romau, Duke of Yaledom, Baron of Angriver and the Prince of Katerin. Several hours after these events they all formally declared their secession from Griffonia..."
 imperial.23.a:0 "Curse you, Archons! Curse you!"
 imperial.24.t:0 "Facing the Facts"
 imperial.24.d:0 "We must face the facts. Gabriela and her lackeys are too numerous and strong for us to tackle alone. We must unite with our fellow lords and fight the heathens to the West!"
 imperial.24.a:0 "Send out the invitations"
 imperial.24.b:0 "We'll fight the Duchess on our own!"
 imperial.25.t:0 "An Invitation"
 imperial.25.d:0 "It seems that the Baron of Angriver and the now exiled Archon Eros have once more called upon us to assist them. They tell us that none of the secessionist states can hope to stand against the Duchess and her lackeys alone, and that we are inclined to agree with them. Furthermore, they have proposed a formal alliance between our two nations."
 imperial.25.a:0 "We must work together!"
 imperial.25.b:0 "We can take the Duchess on by ourselves!"
 imperial.26.t:0 "Romau Accepts"
 imperial.26.d:0 "The Free City of Romau has decided to accept our proposal and join the Holy League."
 imperial.26.a:0 "Great!"
 imperial.27.t:0 "An Invitation"
 imperial.27.d:0 "It seems that the Baron of Angriver and the now exiled Archon Eros have once more called upon us to assist them. They tell us that none of the secessionist states can hope to stand against the Duchess and her lackeys alone, and that we are inclined to agree with them. Furthermore, they have proposed a formal alliance between our two nations."
 imperial.27.a:0 "We must work together!"
 imperial.27.b:0 "We can take the Duchess on by ourselves!"
 imperial.28.t:0 "Yaledom Accepts"
 imperial.28.d:0 "The Duke of Yaledom has decided to accept our proposal and join the Holy League."
 imperial.28.a:0 "Splendid!"
 imperial.29.t:0 "An Invitation"
 imperial.29.d:0 "It seems that the Baron of Angriver and the now exiled Archon Eros have once more called upon us to assist them. They tell us that none of the secessionist states can hope to stand against the Duchess and her lackeys alone, and that we are inclined to agree with them. Furthermore, they have proposed a formal alliance between our two nations."
 imperial.29.a:0 "We must work together!"
 imperial.29.b:0 "We can take the Duchess on by ourselves!"
 imperial.30.t:0 "Katerin Accepts"
 imperial.30.d:0 "The Prince of Katerin has decided to accept our proposal and join the Holy League."
 imperial.30.a:0 "Fantastic!"
 imperial.31.t:0 "Joining the Empire?"
 imperial.31.d:0 "The Duchess, together with several other allies of nobility in the Council, has decided to end the autonomy of what territories the empire has left. This decision naturally also affects our lands. With our own Duchess as Regent of the Empire, should we accept and let Strawberry be integrated into the Empire?"
 imperial.31.a:0 "Our fate will be that of the Empire"
 imperial.31.b:0 "The Duchess has betrayed her own people!"
 imperial.32.t:0 "An Offer"
 imperial.32.d:0 "It seems that after solidifying their position, the Duchess has come to the conclusion that it would be best to end the autonomy of the Empire's territories and duchies. While we could most likely veto this outrageous decision in the Regency Council and garner the support of what few of the nobility doesn't support her, chances are Gabriela won't take no for an answer. How do we respond?"
 imperial.32.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept"
 imperial.32.b:0 "To Tartarus with the Duchess! Let her come!"
 imperial.33.t:0 "An Offer"
 imperial.33.d:0 "It seems that after solidifying their position, the Duchess has come to the conclusion that it would be best to end the autonomy of the Empire's territories and duchies. While we could most likely veto this outrageous decision in the Regency Council and garner the support of what few of the nobility doesn't support her, chances are Gabriela won't take no for an answer. How do we respond?"
 imperial.33.a:0 "There is nothing we can do"
 imperial.33.b:0 "Never! Rally our troops!"
 imperial.34.t:0 "An Offer"
 imperial.34.d:0 "It seems that after solidifying their position, the Duchess has come to the conclusion that it would be best to end the autonomy of the Empire's territories and duchies. While we could most likely veto this outrageous decision in the Regency Council and garner the support of what few of the nobility doesn't support her, chances are Gabriela won't take no for an answer. How do we respond?"
 imperial.34.a:0 "It appears our time has come"
 imperial.34.b:0 "If she wants our land, she can come and take it!"
 imperial.35.t:0 "Idiocy in Action"
 imperial.35.d:0 "We have just received word that the Duchess' brother Geralt has taken control over the Duchy of Strawberry. He has managed to rally the population against us, in defiance against our demand for integration."
 imperial.35.a:0 "Brother or not, he and the other traitors must pay!"
 imperial.35.b:0 "A foolish move... but we don't have time for family feuds, right now"
 imperial.36.t:0 "Feathisia Politely Refuses"
 imperial.36.d:0 "It seems that Duke Gerlach has somehow taken our demand to formally rejoin the Empire as something he can politely refuse. Additionally, he has 'politely' ended his country's vassalage and servitude to the Empire. What is our response?"
 imperial.36.a:0 "We politely declare war"
 imperial.36.b:0 "We politely step back"
 imperial.37.t:0 "Bronzehill Defies Us"
 imperial.37.d:0 "It appears the Count of Bronzehill has gone mad, considering he not only refused our request for integration but also insisted on no longer being our vassal."
 imperial.37.a:0 "Up the mountain we go"
 imperial.37.b:0 "There's plenty of other mountainous no bird's land to reclaim"
 imperial.38.t:0 "Greifenheim's Defiance"
 imperial.38.d:0 "The Duke of Greifenheim has decided to openly defy us and declared himself independent after we called for the integration of our vassals. Surely he is aware of the consequences?"
 imperial.38.a:0 "Let's teach this fool a lesson"
 imperial.38.b:0 "The Empire doesn't need them, anyways"
 imperial.39.t:0 "The Empire Strikes Back"
 imperial.39.d:0 "After a series of reforms, miraculous victories and countless rebellions, the long suffering Griffonian Empire has, under the guidance of the Nobility, managed to reclaim the Griffonian Heartlands. While many of the still independent Griffon Kingdoms were hoping that Duchess Gabriela and her noble allies would be satisfied with the realm they've carved out for themselves, it seems that this will not be case, as today the Duchess, with her young protege Emperor Grover VI in tow, made a speech announcing that the Griffonian Empire shall not stop until all Griffons are united under it's banner once more."
 imperial.39.a:0 "It seems there is still hope for the Empire..."
 imperial.40.t:0 "The Fight against Illiteracy begins"
 imperial.40.d:0 "It appears our campaign against illiteracy is bearing some initial fruit, as middle and lower class citizens begin to read simple texts."
 imperial.40.a:0 "It's a start"
 imperial.41.t:0 "Improved literacy"
 imperial.41.d:0 "Our ongoing program against illiteracy is beginning to show its worth, as more and more children are being enlisted in schools. Not only this, but many adults are also now taking reading classes."
 imperial.41.a:0 "I'm sure those chicks will enjoy school lots"
 imperial.42.t:0 "Fighting Illiteracy"
 imperial.42.d:0 "Our war against illiteracy is now almost at an end, with illiteracy rates at an all-time low and most citizens having completed at least a basic level of education."
 imperial.42.a:0 "The war is nearly over"
 imperial.43.t:0 "Victory"
 imperial.43.d:0 "After many years of more or less forcing our people to educate themselves, we have finally managed to all but eradicate illiteracy within our nation. Our future shines just a little bit brighter."
 imperial.43.a:0 "Finally!"
 imperial.44.t:0 "The Coronation"
 imperial.44.d:0 "Today marks a wonderful day in the reconstituted Griffon Empire! This morning, rising with the dawning sun, Grover, sixth of his line, was crowned Emperor. Upon coming of age, the young chick is no longer that, but a proud member and glorious leader of the Grand Empire. The ceremony itself was a beautiful affair, with the Archonate Choir providing all the soundtrack necessary. Archon Eros the now former Lord Regent gave a short speech, calling forth visions of a wonderful and glorious future for the Empire. The crown was rested upon its rightful owner’s head, and the crowd present cheered for their new Emperor. Then, all were asked for silence, as Grover gave his speech. “Friends. Brothers and Sisters: We have finally returned our Holy Griffon Empire from the darkness of this Generation. And even still, our foes stand against us, ready to strike. But this matters not. With the gods on our side, none can stand against us, truly. From this day forward, we will march confidently towards our destiny; not one step back!”"
 imperial.44.a:0 "Long live the Emperor! Long live the Empire!"
 imperial.45.t:0 "The Coronation"
 imperial.45.d:0 "Today marks a new chapter in the history of the Griffonian Empire! On this bright and sunny morning, Grover VI, heir to the throne of the Empire, was crowned Emperor in full by the Lady Regent Duchess Gabriela. Following a short speech by the Regent, the Emperor himself took to the stage, and spoke of the Empire’s future prospects. “Friends… My people. Our past years, the years of my childhood, have been long and difficult. We have been made to fight - militarily, economically, and psychologically, against all odds and all those who would threaten our way of life. But today is not a day of war. Today is a day of success and peace, of victory and serenity. Today marks the end of our past, and the beginning of a bright future. The Empire has returned, and together, friends, we shall lead Griffonia into a new golden age. An age of peace and prosperity!"
 imperial.45.a:0 "Long Live the Emperor! Long live the Empire!"
 imperial.46.t:0 "Industrial Development"
 imperial.46.d:0 "The members of the IAC, despite not being capable of getting enough state funding to fulfil the production goals set for them by the Crown, have decided to use money out of their own pockets to fund the construction of several new factories around the Empire."
 imperial.46.a:0 "How nice of them"
 imperial.47.t:0 "Railroad Construction"
 imperial.47.d:0 "The IAC has recently decided to set aside a certain amount of their budget to construct several new railways to both connect the Empire and increase our industrial production."
 imperial.47.a:0 "More trains are good. I like trains."
 imperial.48.t:0 "Scandal Within the Palace"
 imperial.48.d:0 "The Noble Advisory Council, founded by the Imperial Regent, was created to both raise and advise the young Emperor Grover, as well as govern the nation while he matures. Certain members have been using their spots on the council to advance their social position or increase their own wealth. However, many of our citizens expect the nobility to be at least somewhat corrupt. Even still, it is hard to ignore, let alone tolerate an orgy within the imperial palace between multiple members of the council. The Press, naturally, had a field day. The local authorities and witnesses... not so much."
 imperial.48.a:0 "The Aristocracy!"
 imperial.49.t:0 "Noble Deeds"
 imperial.49.d:0 "As of recently, the Noble Advisory Council has been doing their job with an extra lack of corruption or indecency. While we don't know the reason for this change of policy, our citizens are satisfied with the current situation. For now."
 imperial.49.a:0 "That's new"
 imperial.50.t:0 "The Knights of Arcturus"
 imperial.50.d:0 "Ever since we gave both funding and support to the Knights of Arcturus, they have been working tirelessly to improve the nation in any way they can. This has manifested itself in many ways, from building schools to repairing temples and more recently building their own paramilitary organisations. While these so called Squires are officially trainee knights they more or less fulfil the role of the Order's personal military police. This has increased support for the Imperial Regent and the Council of Three, but needless to say it has left some of our citizens slightly worried."
 imperial.50.a:0 "The innocent have nothing to fear"
 imperial.51.t:0 "Alms for the Poor"
 imperial.51.d:0 "Since State Eleos has been restored by the Archonate of Eyr, both the Archons and the few pious amongst the nobility have been working tirelessly on improving the lives of the common Griffon. These efforts have not gone unnoticed by our people, as support for the Council of Three and the Emperor is once more on the rise."
 imperial.51.a:0 "Great!"
 imperial.52.t:0 "The Ministry of Public Safety"
 imperial.52.d:0 "After the countless rebellions and revolutions that have happened over the past thirty years, it has become clear that the Empire's enemies do not come only from outside the Empire, but the inside as well. Despite the fact that the majority of our enemies are now firmly outside the country, ruling their own little fiefs, some officials and citizens are still worried about the idea of yet another bloody revolution. These individuals, headed by Ela Grimwing, have proposed that we create an organisation that would seek to fight these radical elements that aim to destroy our Empire from within."
 imperial.52.a:0 "Having someone to look over our shoulder wouldn't hurt"
 imperial.52.b:0 "We can trust our people"
 imperial.53.t:0 "The Maréchal and the Emperor"
 imperial.53.d:0 "Leonard Rodier the infamous Maréchal and one of Aquileia's greatest generals has decided to come before us. It is no secret that Rodier decided to leave his homeland after the Second Revolution due to his belief of Aquileia failing as a nation, thus he has come before us to offer his services to our nation in the hopes that he might one day return to his beloved homeland and liberate it from the Republicans and Communists that have overrun it."
 imperial.53.a:0 "Welcome aboard, now please take a shower"
 imperial.53.b:0 "Go away Rodier, no one likes you"
 imperial.55.t:0 "Griffonia Demands Servitude"
 imperial.55.d:0 "Archon Eros, perhaps feeling emboldened by his more recent successes has decided to issue us an ultimatum... Serve the Empire or be destroyed, needless to say this ominous message has caused quite a stir within our entire country, but the question remains what shall we do?"
 imperial.55.a:0 "Let them come"
 imperial.55.b:0 "We can't hope to stand against them"
 imperial.56.t:0 "Skyfall Does not Bend"
 imperial.56.d:0 "Perhaps somewhat predictably the government of Skyfall has decided to not bow down before us, how shall we respond?"
 imperial.56.a:0 "How cute, they think they have a choice"
 imperial.56.b:0 "But, I like their whiskey..."
 imperial.57.t:0 "Skyfall Submits"
 imperial.57.d:0 "Unexpectedly the government of Skyfall has decided to submit to our demands, bringing the second largest city in Griffonia back under our control with not a drop of blood spilled."
 imperial.57.a:0 "Install a friendly government, and watch the money pile up"
 imperial.58.t:0 "The Fate of Aquileia"
 imperial.58.d:0 "After a gruelling battle we have managed to finally defeat Aquileia, our biggest rival in Western Griffonia, however despite their defeat it seems that our issues in Aquileia are far from over. Marshal Rodier, perhaps emboldened by his role in helping defeat Aquileia has all but demanded that Aquileia become an autonomous region within our Empire, with himself at it's head. What shall we do?"
 imperial.58.a:0 "Let Rodier have his little playground"
 imperial.58.b:0 "You must be joking?"
 imperial.59.t:0 "The Aquileian Rebellion"
 imperial.59.d:0 "Betrayal! Marshal Rodier and his Aquileian brethren have risen up all across the former Kingdom and after kicking out our soldiers, declared an Aquileian State under the leadership of Rodier and his MPA lackeys, it seems that our Aquileian troubles have only just begun."
 imperial.59.a:0 "I want the bastard's head on a spike"
 imperial.60.t:0 "Of Things That Never Happened"
 imperial.60.d:0 "An interesting book was published today, Of Things That Never Happened by Barys Solartail follows the life of a character simply known as Ropshin, a Republican terrorist who has been ordered by his superiors to assassinate a Wingbardian Noble. While the premise of the story is rather simple the writer focuses more on the character of Ropshin and his beliefs than the actual plot of the story, some critics have even pointed out that at times it feels as if the character and the writer are the same person. Nevertheless the book has been generally warmly received both by commoners and nobles alike."
 imperial.60.a:0 "Ropshin you say? Where have I heard that name before?"
 imperial.61.t:0 "The Empire Strikes Back"
 imperial.61.d:0 "For a long time now, politicians and military staff within [Root.GetName] have eyed the renewed Rise of the Griffonian Empire across the Sea with a great deal of dread. Today, their fears have been confirmed, at last. A formal Request was sent to [Root.GetLeader] by the Empire, in which is stated that our Land was once part of the imperial realm, and that it still belonged to the Empire nowadays. They demand our immediate submission to the Imperial Crown, and that we return our status back to that of a Colony of the Empire. This would effectively undo all our efforts of making ourselves a strong, independent Country. However, it is without a doubt that the Empire is a force to be reckoned with, once more. What is our reply?"
 imperial.61.a:0 "No! Never again!"
 imperial.61.b:0 "An Emperor does not bow to another Emperor! Charge!"
 imperial.61.c:0 "It's our only option..."
 imperial.62.t:0 "[From.GetName] does not bend!"
 imperial.62.d:0 "The fiendish fools over in [From.GetName] have had the audacity to refuse our rightful reclamation of Colonial soil. Very well. If they do not bend the knee voluntarily, we shall make them bleed until they do."
 imperial.62.a:0 "Have at them!"
 imperial.63.t:0 "[From.GetName] bends!"
 imperial.63.d:0 "Those spineless cowards over in [From.GetName] have finally seen reason, and have agreed to our demand. [From.GetLeader] has already requested an audience with the Regency Council, willing to resubmit to the Empire. Our old colonial possessions finally return to the fold."
 imperial.63.a:0 "A wise Choice!"
 imperial.65.t:0 "The Republican Dream"
 imperial.65.d:0 "A few days ago, one of the most famous modern day authors in the Griffonian Empire, Friedrich Winger, released his newest Book called 'The Republican Dream'. In the Book, Winger looks back at the Republican Revolution inside the Griffonian Empire. He makes an effort to not only teach History, but also attempts to show that some of the Republican thoughts were quite progressive for the time, and they could still be a valid and necessary addition to imperial society today. After harsh backlash from Public, Winger once again clarified that he supports the Crown, and that he does not affiliate himself with the Republic in any way. The Book has so far been a moderate success in the Empire itself, but saw even greater success in other Countries, such as Aquileia."
 imperial.65.a:0 "A surprisingly interesting read"
 imperial.65.b:0 "A load of potentially dangerous nonsense"
 imperial.66.t:0 "The Imperial Banquet"
 imperial.66.d:0 "The Imperial Banquet is an ancient Griffonian tradition that dates back to the glory days of the Empire. Every ten years, nobles from all corners of the Empire would assemble at the capital of Griffenheim to spend one - sometimes even two - joyful evenings together. This helped strengthen our ties with the many dukes and princes of the Empire, and allowed the Emperor to improve relations with them.\n\nThe next Banquet is scheduled in just a few weeks, but our court is unsure about the exact procedures. Considering our weakened hold over the continent, it is unsure whether we should invite only those nobles still loyal to the Empire, or whether we should extend a claw to all who once were under our banner as a sign of good will."
 imperial.66.a:0 "We don't dine with traitors!"
 imperial.66.b:0 "A grand feast for all!"
 imperial.67.t:0 "The Banquet"
 imperial.67.d:0 "The night went along smoothly. Carriage after carriage arrived in front of the Imperial Palace, the most important of which were greeted by the regent, [Root.GetLeader], and even young Grover VI himself. This banquet was quite clearly one of the smaller ones, and the mood seemed to be sour at first. Soon, however, the memories of old returned to our guests, and the celebrations began. Games were played, words were exchanged, jokes were made. At the start of the Great Feast, the Duchess made a great speech. She spoke of ages long passed, and how it was the Empire's duty to carry on and reclaim its legacy and destiny. In the end, three cheers were had for our young Emperor."
 imperial.67.a:0 "We've made our resolve clear"
 imperial.68.t:0 "An Invitation"
 imperial.68.d:0 "A messenger from [From.GetNameDef] has just reached the court of [Root.GetLeader], delivering a formal invitation from [From.GetLeader]. It appears that despite our rivalry with the Empire, [Root.GetLeader] has been invited to the Imperial Banquet over in Griffenheim, an ancient Griffon tradition that dates back over one hundred years. Many a dozen nobles have been invited, and we could use this opportunity to - just for one night - forget our differences and grudges with the Imperials."

 imperial.69.t:0 "The Banquet"
 imperial.69.d_vassals_only:0 "Once a grand assembly of Griffonian nobility, the Banquet was a rather awkward experience for all. Only the few loyal nobles arrived to join us and celebrate, and the grand Imperial Palace has never seemed this empty. The Regent and young Grover VI also attended the Banquet, and tried to improve relations with the few nobles that showed up, but it was a quiet, uneventful and awkward night, nonetheless. The once Grand Feast at the end of the Banquet was nothing more but a reminder of how large and powerful the Empire once was, as the vast majority of the room remained unfilled."
 imperial.69.a:0 "At least we kept the traitors out..."
 imperial.69.d_few:0 "The last night was a rather disappointing and quiet sight to behold. Of the many nobles that were invited, only a small fraction decided to accept.[Root.GetGRIMajorsInvite] [Root.GetLeader] and young Grover VI attended as well, and attempted to lighten the mood in the rather empty-looking halls of the Imperial Palace. The Grand Feast marked the end of the celebrations, and yet many places on the table remained empty. The Regent thanked everygriff that showed up, and cursed all of those that remained home under their breath."
 imperial.69.b:0 "Shouldn't have invited them, after all"
 imperial.69.d_most:0 "The last night was a night of pomp and old glory. Many of the invited nobles made up their minds and accepted our good will.[Root.GetGRIMajorsInvite] The great halls of the Imperial Palace were filled with Nobility, truly reminding many of the old days of the Empire, and even bringing back nostalgia to some. The mood was light and joyful, and after some time even the deepest of grudges were forgotten about. The Grand Feast marked the end of the Banquet, and [Root.GetLeader] held a brilliant speech in which they thanked all visitors for their attendance and cooperation. During all the political rivalry and turmoil on the continent, the Banquet showed us that there can be peace between all of us, yet."
 imperial.69.c:0 "A spark of old glory"
 imperial.69.d_all:0 "The Nobility on this continent appears to have seen reason and our good will, and all of them went ahead and accepted our invitation. Carriage after carriage they arrived at the Imperial Palace in Griffenheim, being greeted by the young Grover VI and [Root.GetLeader]. Among those nobles were loyalist as well as 'traitors', and even old rivals.[Root.GetGRIMajorsInvite] The mood was a bit shaky at the start, but the ice was soon broken, and old time grudges were forgotten in favour of light-hearted jokes and conversations. It seems that between all of the Griffonian politics, everygriff used this night to simply enjoy the company of each other. Even better, during the Grand Feast at the end of the celebrations, young Grover, with the support of the Regent, held a speech in front all of our guests, announcing his deep thanks to all of them, and stating that this night, if anything, is a sign that peace in Griffonia, between all of us, is possible, after all. We are Griffons, in the end. The guests raised their mugs and cheered, and the Feast began."

 GRI_naval_base_desc:0 "Our new navy is growing at a rapid rate, but we must find somewhere this navy can call it’s home; somewhere safe where they can repair and relax between journeys seaward, and prepare for the next mission."
 GRI_big_fleet_for_you:0 "Fly the Imperial Flag"
 GRI_big_fleet_for_you_desc:0 "The Grand Navy of the Empire has returned, and it's stronger than ever. Raise the flag high, men! To victory!"
 GRI_cat_trade_interdiction_f:0 "Promote Admiral Stormfeather to Grand Admiral"
 GRI_cat_trade_interdiction_f_desc:0 "A curious griffon who we nearly lost to Nova Griffonia when the empire split apart, Stormfeather is a proponent of what he calls “U-boats”, and believes that our way forward is to convert our surface fleet to a new, modern, trade hunting fleet. Perhaps this is a good way forward?"
 GRI_submarines:0 "Silent Hunters"
 GRI_submarines_desc:0 "You can't hit what you can't see. At least, that's our theory. It's time to make good use of that theory and develop our own under-water craft, and the Griffons needed to crew them."
 GRI_destroyers:0 "The Modern Privateers"
 GRI_destroyers_desc:0 "An old tradition from days of wooden sailing vessels, Privateering is taking on a new face, with the invention and development of more modern vessels leading to more brash and aggressive new captains. We should reward these captains with new vessels more akin to their preferred specifications."
 GRI_amphibious:0 "Land and Sea"
 GRI_amphibious_desc:0 "The War at Sea is one thing, but winning the war on land should always stay our main priority. Thus, we must develop new tools and craft to aid our troops. Our troops will fight anyone; no matter how far away or how well protected they might be."
 GRI_raiding:0 "Unrestricted Naval Warfare"
 GRI_raiding_desc:0 "There is no time to determine whether a vessel is a threat or whether it's boarding civilians. We have declared these oceans our waters, and if they are unwilling to respect that in a time of war, the guilt is on their own claws."
 GRI_army:0 "Begin Reforming the Imperial Army"
 GRI_army_desc:0 "Our army is in a sad state of affairs. The time has come to begin reforming it into a proper Imperial Military wing that anygriff can be proud to be a part of."
 GRI_infantry_equipment_f:0 "Shinier Guns"
 GRI_infantry_equipment_f_desc:0 "Our muskets of old are getting to the point of uselessness due to modern military doctrines. If we have any hope to keep up with our neighbours, we must modernise. New, shinier, and more importantly, deadlier guns are in order."
 GRI_support_equipment_f:0 "Clean Bandages"
 GRI_support_equipment_f_desc:0 "We need to reconsider our stance on how we treat our wounded. Quite frankly, our “battlefield doctors” are terrible, and this is getting more Griffons killed out of battle than in battle. We urgently need to fix this problem."
 GRI_artillery_f:0 "Bigger Guns"
 GRI_artillery_f_desc:0 "Not only do we need better guns, but larger guns as well. The age of cannons has passed, and the thunder of artillery will make our enemy tremble before us."
 GRI_light_tank_f:0 "Armoured Tractors"
 GRI_light_tank_f_desc:0 "A couple enterprising Griffons have approached us with the idea to slap armoured plates onto a tractor, like a large piece of armour plating. While this particular model doesn't pose much of a threat, perhaps such a new type of vehicle could be of good use?"
 GRI_doctrine_grand_battlepan:0 "Bronzetail's Ball Busting Fortresses"
 GRI_doctrine_grand_battlepan_desc:0 "Bronzetail believes that we should make our defensive positions so unassailable that the enemy either does not go forward, or does so with unacceptable casualties. Perhaps this is the military focus we should follow, his patent pending name aside."
 GRI_support_equipment_f_but_better:0 "Support Squads"
 GRI_support_equipment_f_but_better_desc:0 "Building on our new military reorganisation, it is time to develop specialised support squads, capable of aiding our frontline soldiers. Thus, our soldiers will spent more time shooting at the enemy instead of taking care of supplies, wounds, or whatever else it might be."
 GRI_enigma_code:0 "The Engima Code"
 GRI_enigma_code_desc:0 "A brilliant piece of military engineering, developed by an electronics engineer named Edward Nigma, E. Nigma’s code is a modern and supposedly impossible to break secret message code, that we should focus on spreading and implementing in our military as fast as possible."
 GRI_magic_weapons:0 "Weapons of the New Age"
 GRI_magic_weapons_desc:0 "After hearing of magical weapon experiments from across the ocean, now is the time to make our own attempts at producing them. The future is now."
 GRI_doctrine_superior_firepower:0 "August's Fire and Brimstone"
 GRI_doctrine_superior_firepower_desc:0 "The more the merrier. August believes we should focus on massing as much firepower as possible, as often as possible, so as to break our enemies as quickly as possible, with as little loss of our own lives as we can. Perhaps we should make this our main military focus."
 GRI_infantry_equipment_f_but_better:0 "Modern Firearms"
 GRI_infantry_equipment_f_but_better_desc:0 "While our old weapons have served us well in the past, it's time to catch up to the world. These new rifles are a far cry from our old muskets and bayonets, and will take some time to learn to use properly, but the updated designs are highly important in keeping us on the edge of technology."
 GRI_motorized:0 "Armoured Cars and Trucks"
 GRI_motorized_desc:0 "With our successful tractor experiments, we have decided that it would be a good idea to put armour on our cars and trucks as well, to give them a similar role in battle, and to continue modernising our force."
 GRI_artillery_f_but_better:0 "Mass Artillery Bombardment"
 GRI_artillery_f_but_better_desc:0 "Using massive amounts of Artillery, we can destroy enemy formations, as well as morale. When our troops finally close on the enemy, they will surely rout sooner than later."
 GRI_mobile_warfare_focus:0 "Thundertail's Shock and Awe"
 GRI_mobile_warfare_focus_desc:0 "Thundertail believes that the way to win our wars is to attack as fast as possible, with as much power as we can without sacrificing our rapid advance. Thus, we overtake our enemies before they are able to realise we’re right on top of them. Perhaps we should make this our main military focus?"
 GRI_light_tank_fs:0 "Proper Tanks"
 GRI_light_tank_fs_desc:0 "With the success of our tractor experiments, it is time to fully develop the “tank”, as it's being called, and turn it into a proper weapon of war, rather than a hodgepodged prototype. Standardisation and upgraded designs are in order, as soon as possible."
 GRI_medium_tank:0 "Heavier Tanks"
 GRI_medium_tank_desc:0 "While our proper modern tanks are good and well, we should make attempts at heavier, more armoured and powerful designs."
 GRI_heavy_tank:0 "Moving Forts"
 GRI_heavy_tank_desc:0 "Our Heavy tank concepts are good enough to begin producing, but we should aim to build truly mobile fortresses of armour, nigh-impenetrable by our enemy’s weapons."
 GRI_military_academy:0 "The Imperial Military Academy"
 GRI_military_academy_desc:0 "Our Military has come a long way from its humble beginnings. And yet, there is so much more that it can learn and improve upon. It is time to open up and fund an academy dedicated to training the next generation’s bright, young military minds. Who knows what the future holds?"
 GRI_airforce:0 "The New Griffonian Air Force"
 GRI_airforce_desc:0 "The time has come to finally expand the Griffonian Air Force."
 GRI_airbase:0 "Expand the Imperial Airports"
 GRI_airbase_desc:0 "Once a novelty of engineering and completely impractical for military use, the aircraft is beginning to define the future, and as such, we should begin to invest in it. We shall begin with making room for air bases around the empire."
 GRI_doctrine:0 "A New Doctrine"
 GRI_doctrine_desc:0 "Our old methods of fighting in the air have, overnight, become completely obsolete. To support our new focus on aircraft, we must develop new, better doctrines for winning the war in the air."
 GRI_fighter_focus:0 "Fight for the Sky"
 GRI_fighter_focus_desc:0 "As Griffons, the sky is our home and domain, and new aircraft models dedicated to keeping it as such are in order. We will design and produce planes that outmanoeuvre, outperform, and outfight our enemies."
 GRI_bomber_focus:0 "Bomb the Enemy"
 GRI_bomber_focus_desc:0 "While fighters are useful in shooting down other fighters, we need a type of plane that is able to destroy enemies on the ground with regularity, in order to aid our troops on the ground. Now is the perfect time to begin investing in creating such designs."
 GRI_CAS_effort:0 "Close Air Support"
 GRI_CAS_effort_desc:0 "In light of a need for a better ground support airplane, a few inventive Griffons have begun drafting designs for a dedicated support plane. We should aid these designs as much as possible, to further improve upon our fledgling Air Force."
 GRI_advanced_doctrine:0 "Improve Our Doctrine"
 GRI_advanced_doctrine_desc:0 "With new aircraft now in service, we must improve upon our young Air doctrine, both to fix issues that we have come across, and to support new types of planes."
 GRI_train_pilots:0 "Legacy of Griffonia"
 GRI_train_pilots_desc:0 "Griffonia is the home of the Aerial Aces of yore. With a new breed of Knights of the Sky coming to forefront, it is time for us to retake our legacy, and remind our enemies why our aces were so feared, and why they still should be."
 GRI_paratroopers:0 "Found a Paratrooper Corps"
 GRI_paratroopers_desc:0 "As we know, what comes up must, eventually, come down. Perhaps we should make a group of soldiers dedicated to this principle, to act as a special force able to go where normal troops are unable to?"
 GRI_airbase_2:0 "The Great Railroad in the Sky"
 GRI_airbase_2_desc:0 "Where we’re going, we don't need roads. More airports are in order, to better facilitate the transport of supplies, troops, and their equipment from one area to another, as quickly as possible."
 GRI_project_arcturus:0 "Project Arcturus"
 GRI_project_arcturus_desc:0 "Arcturus, your fierce-hearted sons call for your aid, oh full-famed god of war. To you do soldiers pray when battle is most heated, when mettle is most needed. To you as well do we turn in desperate times, to you do we call for strength, for the spirit to endure. To you we pray to turn their worlds to ash..."
 GRI_rocket_project:0 "Project Eyr"
 GRI_rocket_project_desc:0 ""We should try to get to the Moon" Said a Griffion once on his fifth bottle of imperial whiskey, and thus the Imperial Space Program was founded."

 GRI_attack_GRF:0 "Reclaim our Colony"
 GRI_attack_GRF_desc:0 "Our Empire was once weakened by Revolution and Revolt. Unfortunately, this has cost us our most priced Colony across the Sea. With our regained strength, it is time to take back what is rightfully ours - by force, if we must."

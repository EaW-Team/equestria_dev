 pre_industrial_society_desc:0 "A society in the process of industrial revolution. New machines are imported from abroad and sometimes even manufactured domestically, allowing for far more efficient production of goods. A more extensive bureaucracy and a principle of meritocracy improve governance, economy and healthcare, allowing for the population to grow more.

The countryside is divided into countless small villages and towns, with only a few larger urban settlements. Because of this, rural landowners exert a considerable amount of influence. Hierarchies are strict and titles are often inherited. Production is the responsibility to crafters who often form fraternal societies otherwise known as guilds."

For months we resisted boldly, slowing his advance to a crawl and using scorched earth tactics to deny any gains for him. When our army was finally defeated, the Storm King proceeded to burn down and loot every town that was still intact. We tried hiding our treasures from him, but he was no fool and managed to find them, taking everything valuable for himself. Afterwards his army left us alone to lick our wounds. We have lost everything, except for our honour."
zebrica_legacy_of_storm2:0 "Legacy of the Storm"
zebrica_legacy_of_storm2_desc:0 "When the Storm King invaded us with his army, we initially resisted and fought back, before realising the mad conqueror's strategy was without flaw. Instead of continuing to fight in vain, we sought to negotiate with him and eventually managed to sign a deal that spared us from doom. Angered by our initial resistance, the Storm King sacked our largest cities and burned down many buildings. He then demanded we pay hefty tribute and seized all our artifacts. Our people are angered by our failure to protect them and our economy is ailing."
zebrica_legacy_of_storm3:0 "Legacy of the Storm"
zebrica_legacy_of_storm3_desc:0 "When the Storm King invaded us with his army, we managed to avoid his wrath with either humble tribute, clever diplomacy, cunning trickery or by other means. We gave away all of our valuables and artifacts and in return the Storm King was content leaving us alone for the most part, only sacking and destroying a few towns. Afterwards we became a tributary until he eventually perished. Some of our citizens grumble that we should've fought back against the warlord, but at least our country remains mostly intact."

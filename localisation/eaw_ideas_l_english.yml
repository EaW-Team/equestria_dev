 pre_industrial_society_desc:0 "A society in the process of industrial revolution. New machines are imported from abroad and sometimes even manufactured domestically, allowing for far more efficient production of goods. A more extensive bureaucracy and a principle of meritocracy improve governance, economy and healthcare, allowing for the population to grow more. With less workers needed on farms, many are migrating to cities looking for work in the newly established factories. Rural landowners are losing power while urban merchants are rapidly gaining it."

 agrarian_society_desc:0 "An agrarian society is where a substantial portion of the populace, around 90%, is engaged in agriculture. The countryside is divided into countless small villages and towns, with only a few larger urban settlements. Because of this, rural landowners exert a considerable amount of influence. Hierarchies are strict and titles are often inherited. Production is the responsibility to crafters who often form fraternal societies otherwise known as guilds."

Specialized crafters, few in number, are responsible for production."

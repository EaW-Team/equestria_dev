falcor.25.b:0 "We must submit, it is the only way our ponies are going to survive."
#EQC rejcing

falcor.27.a:0 "Another one bites the dust."
#unrest
falcor.30.t:0 "Popular Unrest Within our Principality"
falcor.30.d:0 "Unrest has hit an all time high within Falcor, many are unsure where our country is headed for, but none of it seems good. Our options are slipping away day by day. The quickest course of action is to invite others in to attempt to ease unrest, or try and pursue the status quo."

However, many in the government remain skeptical of their actions and the Veterans of the Falcor War Association have issued a protest against any rapprochement with Falcor."
falcor.32.a:0 "We cannot trust a [From.GetAdjective]."
falcor.32.b:0 "The past is in the past. Let's forge a new future together."

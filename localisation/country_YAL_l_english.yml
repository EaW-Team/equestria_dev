 #Focuses#
 ###INDUSTRY###
 YAL_subsidize_industry:0 "Subsidise Industry"
 YAL_subsidize_industry_desc:0 "Although some of our more radical economists despise any government interference into the economy, analysts have shown that there is much to gain from subsidising our industries. A few key investments will give us the opportunity to innovate new production methods which will give our factories an advantage over foreign competitors."

 YAL_yale_factories:0 "Revitalise Yale"
 YAL_yale_factories_desc:0 "Yale, the old capital, and namesake of our country, has slowly been eclipsed by Greenback as the heart of òur nation. However, the city lays at a strategic location for regional trade and still has potential to grow its industry. An investment in Yale now would surely see the city regain some of its former splendour."

 YAL_greenback_factories:0 "Invest in the Capital"
 YAL_greenback_factories_desc:0 "Greenback has been the beating heart of Yale since the industrial revolution kicked off. Many of the old cities in Griffonia, like Yale,  grew decadent and new centres of industry and culture took their place. With the city already being the home of our most important companies, we ought to incentivise them to expand their operations in the city."

 YAL_develop_yale_ironworks:0 "Yale Ironworks"
 YAL_develop_yale_ironworks_desc:0 "Yale's industry is experiencing a healthy growth and its new factories are creating their own demands. Steel is key in keeping our industrial base operating and it would be prudent to invest in ironworks on site. A steady supply of iron would surely make the city even more industrious."

 YAL_tungsten_production:0 "Open the Tungsten Mine"
 YAL_tungsten_production_desc:0 "Tungsten is usually mined in small underground extraction sites. However, an open tungsten mine would mean a way higher yield of this strategically important resource, seeing as shells made from this material are essential for modern artillery pieces. Sure, this won't look pretty, but the locals will surely be swayed by the creation of more jobs. "

 YAL_develop_greenback_ironworks:0 "Greenback Steel"
 YAL_develop_greenback_ironworks_desc:0 "Weapons, cars, and many other goods are made from steel. We are lucky enough to have access to enough mines  to supply us with the necessary ores. However, our steel output can be raised even higher by funding another steel mill in the capital."

 YAL_aluminium_production:0 "Secure Aluminium Production"
 YAL_aluminium_production_desc:0 "Although steel keeps heavy industry moving, aluminium is needed for some high-tech products such as airplanes. By investing in aluminium production, alongside our existing steel infrastructure, our industry will be ready for the demands of the future."

 YAL_yale_infrastructure:0 "Highways to Yale"
 YAL_yale_infrastructure_desc:0 "Yale's infrastructure has been neglected for years, since the area lacked the heavy industrial traffic of Greenback. It is imperative that Yale gets properly integrated into our transportation network, so that the southwest will also be open for future industrial development."

 YAL_frontline_infrastructure:0 "Rails to the North"
 YAL_frontline_infrastructure_desc:0 "Most of our trade to Griffenheim flows along rivers, meaning the cities in our north missed out on vital investments into highways and railroads. With the Empire growing ever more volatile, it may be strategically sound to integrate the north into our existing infrastructure network."

 YAL_greenback_infrastructure:0 "Station One"
 YAL_greenback_infrastructure_desc:0 "Our rail network has been centered around Greenback since the first rails were laid down. At the centre of the city is Station One, a masterpiece of late-imperial architecture and a landmark of our capital. As the demand for train traffic grows, it will become imperative to expand this landmark with additional platforms and warehouses."

 ###Society### 
 YAL_educational_effort:0 "Modernise the Curriculum"
 YAL_educational_effort_desc:0 "The speed at which science advances is growing ever faster, leaving griffons in more unfortunate countries behind. However, the universities must keep a steady flow of students coming from the younger generations. To give them the highest chance of success, we must update the curriculum so that our pupils aren't taught outdated theories."

 YAL_bank_reform:0 "Revise the Banking Law"
 YAL_bank_reform_desc:0 "Banking is a time-honoured tradition in all of the Herzland, but the laws that govern these bankers are opaque by design. We will have our most senior professors of law draft a new Banking Law, one that favours our country over these transnationally operating bankers. Even laissez-faire economists agree that the law should guard against perverse incentives as to make the economy more resistant to shock."

 YAL_public_schools:0 "Refurbish the Public Schools"
 YAL_public_schools_desc:0 "With most of our education budget going to universities, our public schools have been chronically underfunded. If we are to secure the flow of young talent to our universities, we must intervene. Our schools require everything, new classrooms, textbooks, and even functioning heating, so that our young ones don't have to sit in class with two winter coats on."

 YAL_land_reform:0 "Land Consolidation"
 YAL_land_reform_desc:0 "The age of feudalism has left its mark on our country, as it has on most of Griffonia. Marriages, ancient contracts, and feuds have made the countryside a confusing patchwork of  fields owned by small farmers and big estates. By encouraging land consolidation, where farmers trade their lands to make more efficient and larger fields, our agricultural sector will surely flourish."

 YAL_agricultural_studies:0 "The Science of Agriculture"
 YAL_agricultural_studies_desc:0 "Agricultural Studies may not be the most prestigious field of science, but it is rapidly developing. Rational management theories and advances in biology and organic chemistry, along with mechanised tools have led to increasing food production across our domains."

 YAL_gold_standard:0 "Embrace the Gold Standard"
 YAL_gold_standard_desc:0 "When the Empire ruled Griffonia, there was no doubt about the stability of its currency. Now that the ironclad faith in Griffenheim is but a footnote in history, we require a new idea. By tying our currency to gold, our money will be stable, as no griffon will doubt the value of this most precious metal!"

 YAL_industrial_breakthrough:0 "Methods for a New Millennium"
 YAL_industrial_breakthrough_desc:0 "Our industry has lagged behind academia for a while, due to a lack of dedicated R&D investments made by our companies. If we are to move our industry into the second millennium, the state must intervene by investing in industrial modernisation. Science will allow our factories to produce more with less!"

 YAL_yale_university:0 "Expand Yale University"
 YAL_yale_university_desc:0 "Yale University is the oldest and most prestigious university in the country, but much like the city in which it resides, the institute has been overshadowed by modernity. However, its expansive libraries and tradition for excellence warrant another investment. We must commission an experienced architect to build a new wing for the old university, so that Yale may soar to new heights!"

 YAL_focused_research:0 "The Research Focus Program"
 YAL_focused_research_desc:0 "Our laboratories, scientists, and other research facilities are ready for the next step in pushing the boundaries of griffon knowledge. With the Research Focus Program, the government will set out a goal for a period of 200 days. In this time, all universities will focus their attention on tackling this particular area of study, as to produce immediate benefits for our people."

 YAL_the_great_yale_archives:0 "The Great Yale Archives"
 YAL_the_great_yale_archives_desc:0 "Borean Wiedergreiff was both an architectural visionary and a griffon working to preserve knowledge. He is responsible for many of the reforms that made Yale what it is today, but he could never see his magnum opus completed. A massive archive, housing all the world's knowledge. The construction of this elaborate building will be a great undertaking, but a worthy project for Borean's heirs."

 YAL_send_invitations:0 "Invite Griffonia's Finest"
 YAL_send_invitations_desc:0 "Borean Wiedergreiff envisioned that his archives would help build peace amongst griffonkind, by becoming a meeting place for the scholarly elite and a beacon against ignorance, which in his view, led to war. With the archives complete, we must invite the best griffon scholars from every nation to study in these archives. May science lead to better understanding between Boreas's chosen."

 YAL_learn_from_the_past:0 "The Treasures of the Past"
 YAL_learn_from_the_past_desc:0 "Warfare, ignorance, and malice destroyed much of the knowledge of the ancient Griffonian Empire. Our archives are helping historians and other researchers piece together the knowledge of the past. Much of the ancients' knowledge may seem outdated, but sometimes they are wiser than we could ever imagine."

 ###Internal Politics###
 ##Fascism##
 YAL_gather_the_council:0 "Gather the Council"
 YAL_gather_the_council_desc:0 "With the events in Griffenheim unravelling fast, Yale can no longer sit idle. Decisive action has to be taken, but the universities disagree on which course of action to take. Rector Magnificus Mikusian will convene the council to force a decision on the future of the Rectorate."

 YAL_bruma_and_gamia:0 "Bruma and Gamia"
 YAL_bruma_and_gamia_desc:0 "In the west of Yale lie the two university cities of Bruma and Gamia. These universities maintain close ties with the local Prelate of Arcturius and have different values than the other universities. Gamia houses brilliant biologists, who dare to push beyond the boundaries of the ethical, while Bruma's social science faculties reject liberal theories in favour of a strong society."

 YAL_archons_patronage:0 "The Archons' Patronage"
 YAL_archons_patronage_desc:0 "The Archons are delighted that Yale has chosen to favour the university of Bruma. To promote Bruma's traditionalist theories to the rest of Yale, they have chosen to increase their investments into our country, increasing the Triarchy's benign influence in our education system. With the Archons' Patronage, our country will rise to greatness. "

 YAL_additional_funding:0 "Charitas"
 YAL_additional_funding_desc:0 "Although the role of charity in griffon society is often debated, a generous donation to public charities by the Triarchy would smooth out tensions in Yale. Many commoners question the renewed prevalence of religion in our society, but if we can show the best side of the temples, their concerns will melt like dew in the sun."

 YAL_archons_visit:0 "Plan the Archon's Visit"
 YAL_archons_visit_desc:0 "His Holiness Archon Proteus III is the embodiment of the traditional values that will save Yale from the culture-destroying ideologies of republicanism and socialism. However, some of the people still doubt the benevolent intent of Arcturius' Archon. A visit by Proteus will remind Yale how Arcturius would want us to live."

 YAL_social_sciences:0 "Bruma's Social Sciences"
 YAL_social_sciences_desc:0 "The university of Bruma is an exception amongst universities. Its faculty for social sciences rejects the universalist ideologies of harmony and socialism as Equestrian attempts to export their way of life. According to the professors of Bruma, if Yale is to weather the coming storm, we must return to our past and look for guidance in our own culture."

 YAL_indoctrinate_students:0 "Motivate the Students"
 YAL_indoctrinate_students_desc:0 "University students are interesting. They have learned so little, yet they think they understand so much. The student body of Bruma already knows their place, working tirelessly to improve Yalish society. It is time that the student bodies of other universities follow this example."

 YAL_address_population:0 "Local Ethics"
 YAL_address_population_desc:0 "Many of our academics have grown too detached from the real world and the normal griffons. Let us return to society and learn from them. The answer to what a just society is, cannot be found in books from Equestrian philosophers. The answer is out there, in the street. All we need to do is look. "

 YAL_common_cause:0 "The Common Cause"
 YAL_common_cause_desc:0 "Now that everygriffon is in agreement with the importance of incorporating our culture into government, we can work on the task at hand. More government discretion will be needed to implement this and several rights will have to be temporarily restricted to ensure that the process proceeds smoothly."

 YAL_new_council_member:0 "A New Council Member"
 YAL_new_council_member_desc:0 "To ensure an easy advantage for Bruma and Gamia in the Council of Rectors, we will need another vote. We will have our allies in the Triarchy of Gods convince the people that the Council requires religious guidance. With this pressure, we will be able to demand for a new member; Arcturian Prelate Michael of the Yaledom."

 YAL_crackdown_on_dissenters:0 "Silence!"
 YAL_crackdown_on_dissenters_desc:0 "Many within our nation criticize the growing power of the Prelate in Yale. We cannot have these griffons organize their strength against us. We must silence these voices via the way of Arcturius the Warrior. Forcefully."

 YAL_offer_compromise:0 "Calm the Voices of Dissent"
 YAL_offer_compromise_desc:0 "The Prelate's appointment to the Council has caused many concerns amongst student and professor alike. With compromises, flattery, and bribes, we will be able to calm the situation. Arcturius the Smith will forge our society together through strength. It is worth the effort, if every Yalian wholeheartedly supports us in the long run."
 
 YAL_challenge_griffenheim:0 "Challenge Griffenheim!"
 YAL_challenge_griffenheim_desc:0 "The foolish Griffenheim nobility have forced out the Archon of Boreas. Without him as regent, who knows what corruption these nobles may force into the head of Grover VI. It is time to restore the Triarchy before Griffenheim unleashes disaster upon us all. Arcturius smiles upon the faithful who take up arms in his name. With the Prelate's blessing, we go to war!"

 YAL_stabilize_council:0 "Yale's New Position"
 YAL_stabilize_council_desc:0 "Archon Eros VII has rightfully been appointed regent of the Empire, with Archon Proteus III part of his ruling council. With them leading the faithful, a new era is sure to follow. The Prelate believes that we will be better off by keeping a semblance of autonomy in the greater Griffonian Empire and the Archons will surely agree with his views."

 YAL_cooperation_offer:0 "Into the Fold"
 YAL_cooperation_offer_desc:0 "Archon Eros VII has been appointed regent of his Imperial Majesty Grover VI, with Archon Proteus III part of his ruling council. Our citizens clamour to re-join the Empire and enjoy the benefits of the Archons' guidance. Who are we to deny the people their birthright of Imperial citizenship?"

 YAL_biological_sciences:0 "The Science of Life"
 YAL_biological_sciences_desc:0 "Gamia is known for its biology department. While most universities have codes of conduct that restrict their attempts to conduct experiments on the living, this university is dedicated to a pure form of knowledge acquisition."

 YAL_initiate_research:0 "Unlimited Potential"
 YAL_initiate_research_desc:0 "With Yale quickly turning away from conventional ethics, there is an opportunity to remove the last obstacles to scientific progress. By altering guidelines and regulations that restrict unlimited experimentation, our full potential will finally be discovered."

 YAL_griffon_biology:0 "Griffon Biology"
 YAL_griffon_biology_desc:0 "We must begin our research at the core. The griffon body. A unique blend of several different species of animals, it is clear that the griffon has adapted to a level of complexity beyond anything else on this planet. Some griffons even have potential for certain types of magic, further proving our superiority."

 YAL_encourage_student_research:0 "Encourage Student Research"
 YAL_encourage_student_research_desc:0 "The students, especially the younger ones, are still a bit weary of going along with our methods. However, there is much potential in Gamia and we must encourage these griffons to let go of any ‘morality' they adopted outside these walls. Progress is the ultimate goal."

 YAL_delve_deeper:0 "Delve Deeper"
 YAL_delve_deeper_desc:0 "Our research is expanding our fields of vision and the future is becoming ever clearer. The griffon body, and its energy, divine essence, life itself. These are not, should not, be the domains of just the Gods. Understanding and manipulating these essential concepts is within our reach."

 YAL_project_auferstehung:0 "Project Auferstehung"
 YAL_project_auferstehung_desc:0 "Life, as it is commonly understood, has a definitive end. However, science may yet pierce the veil that separates the living from the dead and retrieve a soul lost to our world. Imagine the implications!"

 YAL_project_weihe:0 "Project Weihe"
 YAL_project_weihe_desc:0 "Objectively, the Gods hold the most knowledge of the world and therefore, their instructions should be followed. However, the great distance between us and the heavens has made their word unclear and up to interpretation. What if we could retrieve this information directly from the source?"

 YAL_project_wohlstand:0 "Project Wohlstand"
 YAL_project_wohlstand_desc:0 "The world is run by a very complex system of trade, prices, and economic laws. But the griffon mind was never constructed to properly take advantage of these systems, as the inferior understanding of our colleagues in Middenheim demonstrates perfectly. Altering the mind is not beyond our ability, however ."


###Non-Alligned###
 YAL_central_universities:0 "The Central Universities"
 YAL_central_universities_desc:0 "The universities of Greenback, Greengate, and Middenheim all have different specialties, but their leadership shares a similar vision. Ultimately, the goal of science is to serve society. Whether it is with new medicine, new technology, or by increasing prosperity, we will work for a better future!"

 YAL_greengate_engineering:0 "Greengate University"
 YAL_greengate_engineering_desc:0 "The foremost engineers, both electronic and mechanical, have made Greengate their favoured university. The university is close to Greenback, the industrial beating heart of the country. The engineers of Greengate are eager to receive more funding, promising quick returns in technical advancements!"

 YAL_radar_research:0 "Project Sentinel"
 YAL_radar_research_desc:0 "For some time, Greengate's engineers have dreamt of developing our own RADAR system. Not only will such an array provide us with invaluable scientific data, the listening post would help us keep an eye on our neighbours and spot incoming aircraft. Of course, there is a price tag involved."

 YAL_better_air_detection:0 "Watch Everything"
 YAL_better_air_detection_desc:0 "Project Sentinel is a resounding success and the data is flowing in. However, our scientists hunger for even more data to crunch, while our military command is eager to further spy on our rivals' movements. Additional funding could improve our Sentinel stations even more!"

 YAL_industrial_engineering:0 "The Machine Spirit"
 YAL_industrial_engineering_desc:0 "A group of very dedicated engineers have begun wearing robes in our university and are weirdly obsessed with prosthetics. They are really knowledgeable, but may care a bit too much about their prized machinery. Their innovations may serve us well, but let's leave them alone with their machine spirit."

 YAL_synthetic_research:0 "Transmuting the Black Gold"
 YAL_synthetic_research_desc:0 "Greengate University's heritage goes all the way back to that of griffon alchemists. These proto-scientists diligently worked to use magic and science to make lead into gold. Of course, without modern techniques, their efforts were doomed to fail. But some of our engineers are insisting that we give it another try!"

 YAL_form_computer_faculty:0 "Found the Computing Faculty"
 YAL_form_computer_faculty_desc:0 "Mathematics is the foundation of all science. In fact, it is the frame through which we understand the fundamental processes of our world. Visionaries have already dreamt of Automatic Computers, but with electronics and mechanics combined, our new Computing Faculty will lead the way into the future!"

 YAL_encryption_decryption:0 "The Wingaarden Theorem"
 YAL_encryption_decryption_desc:0 "Adriaan van Wingaarden, a Feathisian mechanical engineer, is making amazing breakthroughs in the field of computer technology! We should follow his ideas closely and make sure that our Computing Faculty stays up to date in this new and boundless field of innovation!"

 YAL_pioneers_in_engineering:0 "Pioneers in Engineering"
 YAL_pioneers_in_engineering_desc:0 "Greengate University has become a campus full of exciting possibilities! The experiments and theories conducted here seem way beyond the possible. The machines built will revolutionise modern life, when they become available for the public. These pioneers are paving the way towards a better tomorrow!"

 YAL_health_sciences:0 "Greenback's Academy of Medicine"
 YAL_health_sciences_desc:0 "Yale's largest city is also one of many problems. Hard work in the factories, pollution, and poverty all harm many griffons. The Greenback Academy of Medicine has done miracles to advance the medical sciences. With substantial support, cures that seem decades away can be achieved within reasonable time!"

 YAL_greenback_hospital:0 "Greenback University Hospital"
 YAL_greenback_hospital_desc:0 "Close to the University of Greenback stands the biggest hospital in Yale, where thousands are being treated simultaneously. It is also the training ground for many doctors and a place where, through trial and error, science advances slowly. Some refurbishments, extra staff, and a new wing are sorely needed to keep our healthcare in order."

 YAL_modernised_medical_procedures:0 "Modernised Medical Procedures"
 YAL_modernised_medical_procedures_desc:0 "The lessons from Greenback will have to be rolled out across the country, if we are to keep our entire population healthy. Every death is a tragedy and with the latest medical technology, we hope that all hospitals can work to keep more griffons alive."

 YAL_pharmacology:0 "Pharmacology"

Plus, we do not have conclusive data to support that these drugs have any negative side-effects."

 YAL_magical_potential_desc:0 "The griffon body is vastly different from that of a unicorn or  changeling, but we are still able to perform acts that could be classified as magical.

 YAL_understand_the_body:0 "Understand the Body"
 YAL_understand_the_body_desc:0 "The body houses our soul and mind, but is the most curious part of this trio. Its complexity and harmony seem to always reveal new depths.

Knowledge that could save lives. "

 YAL_art_of_negotiation_desc:0 "“The worst thing you can do in a negotiation is seem desperate to make it. That makes the other bird smell blood, and then you're dead. Leverage is the biggest strength you can have. Leverage is having something the other griffon wants.  Or better yet, simply can't do without. Unfortunately, that isn't always the case, which is why leverage often requires imagination and salesgriffship.”"

 YAL_stock_investiture:0 "National Stock Effort"
 YAL_stock_investiture_desc:0 "For the stock market to be of the greatest benefit to the economy, shareholders should have a long term vision.

 YAL_clawnes_desc:0 "The economy is a circular flow of money, and spending is the crux to prosperity. A lack of confidence in the economy stops consumption, creating depression. To increase the flow of capital, states can keep spending to kickstart the economy. Even war spending will create jobs!"

 YAL_government_oversight:0 "Government Oversight"
 YAL_government_oversight_desc:0 "The market is fickle and prone to failure, like a car engine in need of tuning.

 YAL_steer_the_market:0 "Steer the Market"
 YAL_steer_the_market_desc:0 "The Yalian economy must focus on boosting demand and spending in the economy.

 YAL_self_regulated_companies_desc:0 "Companies go after their own interest, but only the biggest companies have the power to influence our government directly, distorting the market with rules that benefit them.

 YAL_small_arts_funding:0 "Small Arts Funding"
 YAL_small_arts_funding_desc:0 "As scientists, the Yalish never really funded many artistic projects, which were considered a waste of time. However, art can help channel feelings and stories.

 YAL_encourage_national_identity:0 "Democracy is a Herzlander Tradition"
 YAL_encourage_national_identity_desc:0 "A constitutional monarchy was always the logical endpoint for the Herzland.

Freedom, unity and justice for all!"

 YAL_national_defence_strategy:0 "Draft the National Defence Strategy"

It is because you have misplaced your devotion, giving it to corrupt priests and nobles rather than to the Gods. These false messengers seek to lead you astray, so that they may take what you have earned and enrich themselves!" The townsfolk were enraptured. His words struck a chord in the hearts of those who had endured much hardship during the course of the Empire's decline.\n\n"I promise you that there will come a time when the chosen of Boreas will lead a glorious march to strike down the petty tyrants of Herzland."

His voice boomed throughout the field. "This is what you have prepared for: a war of liberation against the deceitful agents who deny the true word of Boreas. They hide in the Imperial City, thinking themselves above the judgement of the Gods. But no walls can hold back our righteous truth!" The Herald held up his claws for emphasis. The knights were captivated, totally silent in anticipation of the Herald's next words.\n\n"We will march on Griffenheim and strike down all their false messengers, but we will not stop there." The glow around the Herald intensified, seeming to rival the sun in sheer brilliance.

The corrupt priests and nobles who used the name of Boreas in vain are symptoms of a greater sickness: impiety." The Herald held his claw high in the air.

Mumbles of fervent agreement spread through the mass of griffons.\n\n"Prayer is the only antidote for this condition. All must look inward and seek divine guidance to reach perfection. Prayer fortifies the spirit and provides you the strength to carry out the will of the Gods. Through the unmatched piety of our griffons, Boreas will shield our nation and shepherd us to glory!" The Herald hovered several meters into the air, spreading his claws wide for emphasis. His followers bowed, clasping their claws together tightly."

 yale.121.d:0 "On an unseasonably warm morning in Griffenheim, throngs of griffons clogged the streets around the Imperial Palace, desperate to hear a much-publicised proclamation from the Herald. Many climbed onto roofs to get a better view as the streets became too crowded. The audience was awed when the Herald revealed himself by flying high above a palace balcony, wings shimmering in the dawn light.\n\n"Boreas is pleased," he began. "By our efforts, this land has been cleansed of its ignorance and the true will of the Gods is heard and heeded. See that our faith has been rewarded! Our priests and our temples help the people as they should. Our lands are blessed with plenty. Our devoted warriors have beaten back the armies of darkness which once threatened Boreas' chosen." The Herald made a slow, sweeping motion with his claw while the crowd rumbled in approval.\n\n"We have created a place where Boreas' children can live in peace and prosperity. A place where the virtues of charity, honour, and labour are respected practiced by all." The Herald smiled, his glow intensifying. "But our work will never be over. We must always act as a holy beacon on this world, guiding the lost by showing them the righteous path. This is our sacred duty, the duty of the Kingdom of Boreas!""

We can not allow this heresy to be tolerated any longer; there must be no disconnect between the Gods and their Temple. The Archon will be executed immediately for his deceptions, and in his place will step the Herald."
 yale.122.a:0 "A just sentence."
 
 yale.124.t:0 "Emergence"
 yale.124.d:0 "On a cloudy day in Gamia, a strange griffon walked the streets, although those who saw him were unsure if he was a griffon at all. He exuded an inexplicable aura and had glowing, unreadable eyes. Every griffon who saw him recoiled in fear and kept their distance, and none were sure what to make of him. What did his appearance mean? What did he want? Was this a sign of the end times?\n\nThe first creature brave enough to approach him was a young girl who strayed from her parents out of curiosity towards the shining griffon. He stopped in his tracks once she blocked his path. "Are you a god?" she asked, looking up at him. Silence filled the air for what seemed like an eternity.\n\n"I am a messenger," he rumbled in response. "You may call me the Herald of Boreas, for my voice is his, and I am his worldly vessel." The Herald turned to the surrounding griffons, raising his claws into the air and spreading his wings. "Heed Boreas' will! Follow me, and I will lead you down the righteous path!" His glow intensified and a blast of heat emanated from him. After a brief moment, the surrounding griffons frantically rushed towards the Herald, pledging their undying fidelity to Boreas."

 yale.125.t:0 "A Walk in the City" 
 yale.125.d:0 "The Herald of Boreas visited Cyrusval and decided to take a walk around, strolling at a leisurely pace while looking at all the beautiful activity in the city. Throughout his walk, he received strange looks from locals due to his subtle aura, but he smiled back at them. When he entered a marketplace, one of the vendors came up to him selling cabbages and was asking who he was. At first the Herald said he was just a traveler, but then the vendor became insistent until he finally admitted he was the Herald of Boreas. Once his identify was known, other griffons took notice and various vendors and buyers came up and asked him if he was the miracle worker of Yale. He muttered yes humbly, and then they all smiled and started chatting with him. This scene soon repeated itself throughout the city as more found out about the mythical griffon's presence. His legend soon spread across all of Cyrusval, despite its somewhat anti-religious leanings."

 yale.127.d:0 "In a crowded square in Bruma, the Herald of Boreas held his wings wide as he delivered his message to curious passersby. Perched atop an obelisk, he had attracted a fair number of students and townsfolk who had heard tales of the strange griffon, and who were excited to have a chance to see him in person.\n\nDuring a pause in the Herald's oration, a shout rang out from the ground. "Get down from there!" Two city guard griffons pushed their way to the front of the crowd and signaled for the Herald to descend. The Herald complied and glided down to meet them. "Preaching is not allowed here, sir," said one of the guards.\n\n"You seek to punish me for speaking the truth of the Gods?" Asked the Herald, perplexed. "If you wish to detain me, I happily offer myself." He lowered his head and extended his claws towards the guards. The two griffons looked at each other hesitantly, but proceeded to place steel shackles around the Herald's claws. Once they were secured, he yanked his claws upwards.\n\n"Behold, the power of Boreas!" The shackles around the Herald's claws began to glow a dull red before becoming a bright orange. In a matter of seconds, the shackles began melting, sending molten metal splattering onto the city cobblestones. At the sight of this, the guards turned around and fled as fast as they could."
 yale.127.a:0 "Through the Gods, all things are possible!"

 yale.128.t:0 "A Fateful Meeting"
 yale.128.d:0 "As the Academic Council convened inside the grand halls of Greenback, a massive mob of griffons gathered outside, angrily demanding the recognition of their prophet. The Herald of Boreas had been traversing Yale, riling up the populace and gaining followers with his denunciations of the current social order. Now those followers converged on the Council determined to see its authority ended permanently.\n\nIn the dimly lit council chambers, Rector Magnificus Mikusian sat with his claws massaging his temples, wondering how this could be happening. Why were the people up in arms over the ravings of a madgriff? How could they believe this Herald was a divine being just because of some trick of the light? Would their delusion be the end of Yale? It was all impossible!\n\nWith a sudden impact, the door to the chamber burst open and a glowing figure walked before the Council. It was the Herald himself, standing alone without any of his followers. "The time has come for the faithful to inherit this land," announced the Herald. Despite being outnumbered by the council members, he exuded supreme confidence. "Boreas demands that you step down, or else invoke his wrath."\n\n"What is the meaning of this?" Mikusian sputtered, his voice trembling. "What are you?"\n\n"Have you not yet heard? Allow me to demonstrate." The Herald spread his wings as his aura intensified into a blinding light. Brilliant white rays bathed the council chambers accompanied by pulses of searing heat. The intensity was such that Mikusian feared the entire building would be set ablaze. After several seconds, the scorching waves and bright light dissipated. The Herald stood tall, completely unscathed, as the Rector Magnificus collapsed onto the ground."

The general staff and the population of Yale thought that we were sure to perish, but our field marshal had drawn up one last defensive line to protect Greenback.\n\nThe Angriver-line. Hastily erected machine gun nests and mortars shielded the retreat of our army along the river's crossings after which Greengate's engineers blew the bridges, including the Imperial Railroad's old line. It was a move of desperation, but what happened next was unbelievable. The Imperial troops tried to wade through the river with their equipment. Their cruel taskmaster generals forced them to try and cross without proper support, ending in a massacre.\n\nWe thought that our luck would surely run out after the first assault, but it seemed that Arcturius had forsaken the poor Imperial soldiers who were, time and again, sent to try and cross the Angriver-line. Some days, the water would turn red with the blood of the slaughtered. Statisticians from Greenback have estimated that a million imperial soldiers have perished in the fighting so far, many times the size of our armed forces. Yale and many other cities might be occupied, but as long as the Blood River preserves us and as long as the minds of our opponents are clouded, we will never surrender."

Within recent years, there has been a division of philosophy between the two schools, fostering a deepening rivalry. Klaumar has been a proponent of the infant theories on mechanized tactics, looking to develop a military centred around armoured formations and combined arms warfare."

 YAL_mobile_warfare:0 "School of Experimental Warfare"
 YAL_mobile_warfare_desc:0 "Staffed by professors who served as attachés to Griffenheim and the Changeling Empire, the School of Experimental Warfare has quickly come to dominate Klaumar Academy. This department has heavily promoted theories of combined arms warfare, hoping to replicate the success of the Changeling army in becoming an efficient fighting force."

 YAL_superior_firepower:0 "School of Artillery and Engineering"
 YAL_superior_firepower_desc:0 "The School of Artillery and Engineering is the academy's oldest faculty. While they've experienced a decline in recent years, they still hold considerable sway within campus politics. While they appreciate the effectiveness of armoured vehicles, they favour them in a supporting role alongside traditional infantry formations, backed by big guns and overwhelming firepower."

 YAL_fight_fire_with_fire:0 "Developing the Guns"
 YAL_fight_fire_with_fire_desc:0 "Our existing artillery is poorly equipped for dealing with armoured vehicles, employing high explosive shells with little armour penetrating potential. Our eventual tanks will require a new type of cannon and shell, focusing more of velocity and armour penetration. The best part, these cannons can be used independent of armour until we've finished development on a tank chassis."

 YAL_improved_barrel_designs:0 "Modern Infantry"
 YAL_improved_barrel_designs_desc:0 "In mechanized warfare, infantry still has an important role to play. While armour is meant to slice through hostile lines, and isolate defending units, infantry is still necessary when dealing with these pockets or heavily defended strongpoints. As such, we should focus on training and equipping our infantry in a manner which allows them to more efficiently accomplish this task."

 YAL_improved_tank_designs:0 "Developing the Tank"
 YAL_improved_tank_designs_desc:0 "Investments into the development of new guns, armaments, engines, and armour have finally allowed us a chance to design and begin work on our very first tanks.

 yale.25.d:0 "Grover V, our emperor, has passed away after touring the new imperial rail network. The fifth emperor of Griffonia had a troubled reign that saw the Empire slowly fracture. This was positive for Yale to the extent that it provided us with greater autonomy from Griffenheim, as we could now force concessions on our overlords. However, our citizens are Herzlanders through and through, bound by a shared culture and past to many griffons beyond our borders. Yale is economically mostly healthy and has a well-functioning government, but one could say it lacks a soul.\n\nWith the Emperor gone, the common griffons are looking for new answers and more and more of them seek to reinvent Yale in one way or another. The technocratic government, led by the universities has not managed to speak to the imagination of our citizens which is leading more and more griffons to search for other answers. Something has to replace the place the Empire held in the identity of the Yalish and the Rectorate might have to reinvent itself if it wants to continue like this."

 yale.49.d_duchess:0 "After months of squabbling, the factions in Griffenheim have finally chosen a regent. Duchess Gabriela Eagleclaw, cousin of the late Emperor, has come out on top and now has a firm control over Griffenheim and presumably her already wealthy estate as well. The council was forced to react and pick a side, as rumour had it that Archon Eros would not let his defeat slide so easily.\n\nIn Yale, all the rectors were present for an emergency gathering. As Mikusian expected, Gamia and Bruma were two birds of a feather and demanded that Yale would secede from the Empire, as Eros was the legitimate regent for young Grover VI. Cyrusval, demanded secession as well, naming a long list of alleged imperialist crimes the Empire had committed. This left the four central universities; Yale, Middenheim, Greengate and Greenback. The rectors of Middenheim and Greengate, who were not much for politics, were willing to stick with the Duchess, which was Mikusian's preferred option. Greenback, however, voted with the radicals. The university refused to be part of what they named “the spending of lives in useless conflicts.''\n\nThis left Mikusian with no choice but to travel to Griffenheim to announce Yale's formal secession from the Empire. He hoped duchess Eagleclaw would swallow her pride and let the Rectorate be, but he feared that the country had to prepare for the worst."

As Mikusian expected, Gamia and Bruma were two birds of a feather and pleaded for Yale to support the Empire, denouncing Eagleclaw as a heathen noble. Cyrusval, demanded secession, however, naming a long list of alleged imperialist crimes the Empire had committed. Greenback also supported secession as they hoped to steer Yale away from any conflict. This left the other central universities; Yale, Middenheim and Greengate. Although Mikusian shared Greengate and Middenheim's loathing for religious authority, the three universities decided that the Archonate, now that it was in control of Griffenheim, was more likely to come out on top. Thus, those three decided to stick with the Empire, meaning a majority of rectors chose for loyalty to Griffenheim.\n\nMikusian sent a letter to Griffenheim the same day to announce to Eros that the Yale Rectorate fully intended on keeping the current arrangement it had with Griffenheim. He hoped the Archons would limit their ambitions and let the Rectorate be, but he feared that the country had to prepare for the worst, even though they tried to stay loyal."

Popular dissent has become an ever more pressing issue, as the old societal attachment to the Empire faded away with the current academic government offering little in the way of legitimacy to Yale. Rector Magnificus Mikusian was not a social scientist, nor was he a terribly cunning politician, but he did have a talent for logical arguments and problem solving. He saw three valid approaches.\n\nFirstly, funds could be made available to support Gamia and Bruma, two universities which had traditionally received a lot of Triarchy funding from Romau and still held strong ties to the clergy. Perhaps their religious connections could appeal to the general populace, but this could come at the price of scientific integrity. Legitimacy through divine sanction. Secondly, he could try and broadly maintain the academic course of Yale, but free more funds for projects that would increase the quality of life in Yale. Legitimacy through results. Thirdly, and perhaps most radically, he could give discretionary funds to the university of Cyrusval. Socialism had recently won over many states and according to the academics of this university, many more states would follow soon. Perhaps by empowering this university, they could reach a compromise position to help the proletariat while avoiding violence. Legitimacy through popular will.\n\nRinging a little bell to call attention to himself, Mikusian spoke up to announce his decision:"

Scientists of Gamia's university have allegedly resurrected Grover II, the most dreaded emperor of the Grover dynasty. A strange combination of technology and magic has supposedly animated the old Kaiser. It shows the desperation of the Yalish government to find something to unite them, and it shows the gullibility of the populace that they buy it. Either way, this Grover is marshalling his forces to take what he beliefs is his by birth right.\n\nGriffenheim. "
 yale.52.d_herald:0 "A strange figure has been gaining popularity in Yale at an astonishing rate. Known only as the Herald of Boreas, this griffon claims to be in communion with Boreas himself. It seems that, supported by the universities of Gamia and Bruma, and by the desperation of the Yalish people to latch on to any sort of meaning, this Herald has managed to take control of the country. Naturally, the Triarchy has condemned the Herald and his followers as heretics, but it seems that that has not stopped the growth of his movement so far.\n\nWe must stop him before the Temple shakes to its core."

In the marketplaces, conversation is hushed, no griffon meaning to be disrespectful by speaking up about it. In the halls of the universities the students made impromptu shrines of flowers and candles, and even amidst communist pamphlets in the halls of Cyrusval's social science faculty, sorrow clouded the air.\n\nAs night fell, a rushed council meeting was held in Yale. Every rector denounced the cruel murder of the Child-Emperor, but what should have united the academics, instead divided them. Erich Mühschabel, Cyrusval's rector, demanded that the Yale military leadership be relieved of command before they could come to a similar idea as the general in Griffenheim. The rector of Gamia warned Mikusian of how this death would absolutely divide the country and that measures had to be taken soon, while Middenheim's delegation recommended drastic increases in military spending if Yale was serious about any sort of retaliation for this horrid act.\n\nDeep in the night, when all delegation were heard, the Rector Magnificus closed the council, promising them that they would reconvene soon.

 yale.1.d:0 "Things have been rough at the Great Archives' construction site. Deliveries of supplies not arriving on time, unusually bad weather, and plain bad luck have come together and caused serious delays. No griffon in particular is to blame, but the project will take significantly longer now."

 yale.2.t:0 "Demand for more Funding"
 yale.2.d:0 "“What do you mean, you forgot to put a zero behind that price? You incompetent son of a pony!”\n\nThe head administrator of the Archives' project raged uncontrollably at one of his clerks. Of course, the poor griffon could not magically summon a sack of gold, so there was little use. The fact remained. The project had gone way over its already ridiculously high budget. He had to ask the government to increase funding again, or risk further delays."
 yale.2.a:0 "Increase funding!"
 yale.2.b:0 "Not a penny more."

 yale.3.t:0 "Precious Materials Lost"
 yale.3.d:0 "The marble used for the statues and pillars of the Archives comes from all over Griffonia, and sadly, even transport for such a noble project isn't always safe from the many dangers and nuisances that cloud Boreas's realm. Several transports of marble, and other valuable materials, have been lost to banditry or held up due to red tape at one of the many border crossings. The problem has become so profound that some of our artists and construction workers lack the materials to continue construction on schedule. We will have to take additional time before the Archives can be opened."
 yale.3.a:0 "If only we griffons could cooperate for the common good."
  
 yale.4.t:0 "A Touch of Genius, A Hint of Madness"
 yale.4.d:0 "The designs left by the great visionary, Borean Wiedergreiff, are both ingenious and cryptic. It is clear that the architect-scholar had accounted for many of the problems we now face, but sometimes it is hard to decipher the griffon's notoriously bad handwriting and ambiguous use of terms.\n\nHowever, with careful study, the architects have managed to decipher a key part of the building plans, which would drastically decrease the needed strength for the Archives' support structure. The project carries on, with significant savings in both material and time."

 yale.6.t:0 "A Most Welcome Donation"
 yale.6.d:0 "A well-known historian, once a student of the famous Borean Wiedergreiff, has given a donation to the construction effort. Although the donation includes some much needed funds, the real treasure is a bundle of texts from the master himself, describing his architectural visions, along with some unique sketches and plans for the Archives. With another perspective on the project, we may be able to increase our construction speed substantially!"

This building, originally thought up by Borean Wiedergreiff, the first scholar-ruler of Yale, has been a dream of many in Yale. The building is an enormous spire, accessible from many floors by the flying griffons. In it are floor upon floor of books, manuscripts and artefacts carefully collected by [YAL.GetAdjective] scientists. Now that the building is complete, this repository of all griffon knowledge will be used to further progress for all griffons.

 #Project Weihe Events
 yale.8.t:0 "Aura Boreae"
 yale.8.d:0 "The question of the gods', and more specifically of Boreas', true nature had been fascinating the scholars of Yale for quite some time. Now, with the most modern techniques, and a scientific curiosity some more conservative griffons would call unholy, the Yale observatory was ready to pierce into the Heavenly Domain of the Gods.\n\nTheologists, astronomers and physicists collaborated in ‘Project Weihe', pinpointing the supposed location of Boreas in the night sky, while the most talented engineers prepared the technical instruments which would open a path into the heavens.\n\nAnd on one fateful night, the project was set, and both audio and visual data was coming in from the intricate machinery set up in the university. First nothing, but when the griffons looked close enough, something materialised before their very eyes. Someone, in fact! An intelligent looking, stern, pale, featherless griffon looked at them. His beak seemed distorted in the image, but there was no doubt that this was the face of Boreas. The researchers became ever more excited, they had definitively proven the existence of God! Amidst the excited chatter of self-important scientists congratulating each other, the audio instruments picked up a message: In old Imperial script he proclaimed: "T Genus Emptio."\n\nThis instruction confused the scholars and the theologists present could not place this divine command in any context. When the scholars tried to re-establish contact with Boreas later, the image never reappeared, nor were there anymore messages from the heavens. Perhaps it was better if the world didn't learn about Boreas's true message. . . "

The cornier reported that the cause of death was likely a heart attack aided by what would appear to be sleep deprivation and a pre-existing condition.\n\nDiscovered next to his body was his journal and a flask.\n\nThe journal begins innocently enough, seeming to discuss the affairs of Otto's day-to-day life and his work. However, after the failure with the initial cryptic message it would appear that Otto began to fall into a spiral of overwork which began to take a toll on the quality of his writing.\n\nSoon after the project's failure, he described receiving a message from the gods, claiming they had bestowed him with the knowledge of reaching their divine message. For a few weeks, his notes continue to hold onto some cohesion as Otto attempted to decipher the cryptic nature of his holy mandate.\n\nHowever, towards the end, his sanity clearly began to slip. Near the final pages, his journal is little more than mad rants, cryptic phrasing, and odd drawings of symbols. However, on the final page, it seems some semblance of sense returned, as he wrote, ‘It is ready'.\n\nInside the flask was a thin white fluid, consisting of some hybrid technomagical substance, whose exact makeup is as of yet unknown."

Most are benign, some are dangerous, a few could end life on Griffonia.\n\nWhen the guards enter, they notice that most of the catalogue has been left untampered, with not so much as an index card being disturbed. The intruder must've known their way. However, they notice that the vault door to G-wing is open, which is not a good sign, as it contains all those compounds which threaten the known world.\n\nThe guards exchange nervous looks as they enter. Plagues, bioweapons, flesh eating fungi and more. All accounted for, luckily. However, these are not the most precious substances the university possesses, the real bad stuff is in the back, the direction the intruder seems to be heading. The guards are in hot pursuit.\n\nSoon, they enter into a small sterile atrium, the storage of all the world's worst horrors, and sitting in the middle is a single griffon. They are bald, dull looking, inconspicuous. It is hard to distinguish anything remarkable.\n\nA guard reaches out his claw and one of the griffon's eyes snap open, causing the guard to recoil.\n\n “W-what are you?” the guard stammers.\n\nThe griffon stands up and spreads his wings. An unnatural light surrounds his wings. His eyes seem to shine with an impossible energy. And a thin drizzle of a certain white fluid is creeping from his beak."

 #Project Auferstehung Events
 yale.26.t:0 "Gamia's Dominance"
 yale.26.d:0 "The recent ascendency of Gamia as the leading Yalish university has ensured that it has access to the funds necessary to attempt some of its most ambitious projects. However, even this vast pool of resources has its limits, meaning we can only finance and supply one of our ambitions.\n\nThe first is known as Project Auferstehung, which looks to build upon the legacy of the fabled Professor Lazarus, an ancient scholar who hoped to find a means of achieving immortality. Recently, our enchanters have theorised that Lazarus's theories were sound and that they were merely lacking the advances of medicine we now possess. Perhaps we can sustain life beyond the grave.\n\nThe second is titled Project Weihe, which looks to bridge the distance between the heavens and our own realm. It is hoped that with modern developments in astronomy and communications we can puncture the heavens and open up a line of communications between the gods and mortals, allowing us the means to access divine knowledge directly from the source."

After tapping the electricity from the entire university, performing the necessary enchantments on the body and via an extremely stressful procedure, we have managed to bring a small rodent back to life.\n\nThe animal remains in good health, with full mental capabilities, were it not for the loss of most of its skin in the process, which is nothing some magic can't hide. The possibilities are endless, but the revival of a sentient being will require much more power and would risk damaging the machinery or perhaps even angering the gods.\n\nBut, Gamia's Board of Directors has approved an ambitious project to ensure the most is made from our singular opportunity to achieve Lazarus's dream. They hope to revive the griffon who is considered by some to be the mightiest warrior to have ever lived and by many more as a brutal tyrant, Grover II. The life of the Empire's second greatest leader ended tragically at the hooves of the riverponies, with the Emperor's remains being interned in Griffonstone.\n\nIf we were able to retrieve them, they could hypothetically be brought back to Yale, and it is possible, that they could be reanimated, allowing us access to the greatest military mind in Griffonia's history."

However, the tomb is in a pitiful state of disrepair, having been neglected for decades. Like the Empire, it is but a shadow of its former self.\n\nIn the dead of night, our team of researchers broke into the tomb and extracted the remains of Grover II. While evading capture at the claws of Griffonstone authorities, they managed to return the bones to Gamia, where they have now become the focus of Project Auferstehung."

Unfortunately, while attempting to get back to Yale, they were caught by the authorities and are now languishing in a Griffonstone prison under the charge of grave robbing.

All around it, scientists, engineers, and enchanters rush, checking instruments and calculations before rechecking them. After all, this experiment demands perfection. One little flaw, one missing calculation, one wrong glyph, any of these could forever destroy the bones of Grover II.\n\nWhen the project's head is satisfied that all necessary precautions have been met, he gestures with a talon. At once, every griffon takes up position. A grad student pulls the fateful lever and the metal slab begins to lower into the stew.\n\nSoon the bones are submerged. A moment passes, then electricity is applied and other chemicals are injected. Outside, the lights of all of Gamia flicker off as the Yalish power supply is taxed to its limits.\n\nThe demand for energy mounts, and soon the lights begin to flicker. A young engineer screams as the glass of a nearby dial shatters, showering them in debris. A minor wound in the name of progress.\n\n”Just a little longer,” the project head mutters.\n\nThis was the culmination of centuries of slow progress, it must succeed.\n\nFinally, the electricity the dials show the satisfactory amount of energy and the flow of electricity ceases. Then, the slab is slowly raised.\n\nDozens of eyes widen and somegriffon gasps at the sight before him. Knees hit the floor as everygriffon in the room bows before who they have awakened.

And that brings us to the present and Grover VI.” The emperor concluded the long dialogue on the story of his offspring, his voice commanding an unnatural echo inspiring awe in those before him.\n\n“Yes, your majesty, that is all about your direct children.” The historian greedily answered, eager to get to bed and hoping his lord would not ask any questions about-\n\n“Now tell me about Guto, my brother. All has changed, but I see Griffonstone is still on the map, that has to be quite the story.” The emperor sat back, his light blue eye turning gentler at the mention of his dear sibling.\n\nThe historian swallowed, and with a trembling voice “Are you certain?”\n\n“Of course I am certain, in fact. . . Scribe, dispatch a courier to Griffonstone at once and tell Guto to fetch me the Idol of Boreas!”\n\nThe scribe, who sat at the steps under Grover's seat, woke from his slumber and looked up with big eyes. “Y-your majesty, I can't.”\n\nGrover glared down at his servant, “You lost the ability to write? Send it in the morning then!”\n\nThe historian took the word, stumbling. “Y-your majesty, your brother's line. . . is extinct. And. . . Guto VI. . . he lost the Idol. . .”\n\nThe arcane energy around the emperor flickered for a second as his expression changed from surprise to disbelief to anger as his voice thundered through the windy manor. “Guto, my brother! His sons spent and his line ended? Boreas abandoned us?” His claw clenched into a fist and smashed down on his chair, a wicked laugh coming from his beak. “I return to this? A child and a corpse are the last hope of the empire?” The Kaiser of Griffonia sat down as calm and determination drove out the anger."

Indeed, Grover II reminded Sköldsvärd of treaties made in ages past which firmly bound Vedina to the Griffonian Empire.\n\nDespite all legal experts claiming the contrary, he still considers these treaties valid and requests the full annexation of Vedina as compensation for our supposed treachery. However, the Emperor recognises that this might be a harsh punishment for Sköldsvärd so in his ‘generosity' the Kaiser offers to instead renew the status of march for Vedina, in exchange for Oövervinnlighet, the god sword. As a symbol of Vedina, the ancient magical weapon is to be stored by the imperials, undoubtedly to humiliate us.\n\nThe Kingdom is in a tricky position, as the Reich is turning out to be one of the most powerful countries on the planet.

Now the north is all but secured. On paper, this was the easiest conquest, with the north lacking the industry that is so important in modern war. Vedina even succumbed without the loss of blood. Now, it is time to test the mettle of my army against our ancient enemies to secure the core lands of my empire. They will undoubtedly lack the foresight of Vedina's queen and will seek to fight me.

He would walk among them, consulting his captains and entertaining the guests of the court, and at the end of the day, he would retire to the imperial dormitory to take counsel with his wife and do get a good night of rest. But now he was here for a different reason. A child occupied his bed. A child of his own blood but one controlled like a puppet by the corrupt and greedy. Gone were the days of the true champions of the Empire. But he may yet restore them. A battle still raged on outside, remnants of the Imperial Army fought his Yalish soldiers. While they may not have been raised as warriors, they fought well enough for Grover.\n\nHe arrived at the gate of the master bedroom, faced not by a full guard detail, but by a single dog. The dog rose from the wooden stool upon which he was seated and leveled his claymore against the griffon in front of him. “Turn back invader. Though I know you are unlikely to be swayed by words, I shall at least try. Leave the Emperor alone. I will not let you take his life.” Grover thought, and then asked, “What is your name?” Surprised by the informality of the question, the dog responded; “I am Benito. Captain of the Imperial Guard, and personal protector of the Emperor of the Griffonian Empire.” He pointed his blade at Grover, “Turn back.” Grover answered with silence; he figured his actions would speak louder. He drew his own blade from its hilt and prepared to duel the Captain. “So be it then.”\n\nThe Captain made the first to move, striking with a speed few at his age possessed. Grover was surprised by the agility of the dog's movements but was able to parry the first strike. The two then began to engage in a startling bout of blows taking up the whole length of the hallway. Benito fought with all the bravery and fury characteristic of him and his people, but in the end, he simply could not match Grover. The hound was cowed and thrown to the side, wounded by his foe's magical weapon, but very much alive. Benito looked up to see the towering figure of Grover over him, but in defiance he growled out one last response. “If you must kill me then just do it, I could not bear to see my young Emperor be shamed or perish. But whatever you do. You will never have my submission.” Grover cocked his head and gazed down upon the dog, “I know Benito, but you dying here would be almost as shameful as my own death.” Grover put down his sword beside the dog and began to walk towards the Emperor's bedroom.\n\nAnd as he walked past, the loyal dog looked upon the inscription on the hilt of his legendary blade, revealing its owner.\n\nEmperor Grover the Second."

The traitor must have hid him here, despite claims that a murder took place. He arrived at the gate of the master bedroom, the cowering guard in front of the door annihilated with a single thrust of his enchanted weapon.\n\nMuch to his anger, there was no Grover VI waiting for him inside the bedroom. There was just one adult standing calmly on the other side of the room, wearing a military outfit, an iron cross adorning his uniform and a gun in his claw. “Stay still, ghost.” Ferdinand Dawnclaw, the self-styled Lord Protector said, his voice not betraying any emotion.\n\nGrover II was fuming, the magical aura around him seeming to almost burst with fury, but he indeed stopped for a moment to glare at his opponent. “Traitor, where is the child?” Grover II could barely keep his voice under control, but this did not seem to unnerve the officer.\n\n“He is where you came from, with the Gods. Or in Tartarus, who knows?” Ferdinand said mockingly, his figure unflinching.\n\n“Liar!” Grover rushed towards the traitor in a cascade of righteous anger. Still, the Lord Protector stood still, simply firing his gun at his opponent. The shot did not seem to even slow down the Emperor, however, and in response Dawnclaw drew his officer's sabre, assuming a defensive posture.\n\nThe weight behind Grover's first strike was almost overwhelming with Ferdinand's sabre only barely managing to deflect the blow. Now it was the Emperor who smirked, following up with another attack. Both combatants knew that this duel could only end one way. As Grover again brought his blade to bear onto Ferdinand, he tried again. “Where is he? Where did you hide him?” Dawnclaw was silent, focussing on his defence, only managing the most basic of counters to the Emperor's onslaught.\n\nMere minutes later the fight was over, and Ferdinand was on his knees, at Grover's mercy."

It had changed so much. The bed he had slept on was gone and what he could assume was the replacement was shoved into a corner to make space for the much smaller bed that now sat in the room's center.\n\nGrover paused. The sheets were thrown about, the pillows off the side, and a cup of water was spilled beside the bed. And, of course, there was no Emperor. Grover saw all this just in time to hear a creak from the rafters above. Turning his head, he could barely think before a small figure swooped down and set upon him.\n\n“AHHHHHHH! Die you Maarite beast!” The child Emperor flew circles around Grover's head, eventually latching onto an exposed rib and proceeding to swing his mighty weapon, a small wooden play sword, and beating the skull of his “attacker” over and over.\n\nGrover, powerful and mighty as he was, could not seem to stop this annoying brat! He did not wish to hurt the child, this was, of course, his own flesh and blood. But Boreas above! He wouldn't stop hitting him! Grover tried and failed to reach around and pluck the child off of his back, with the younger Grover being firmly latched on and with no intention of stopping his relentless assault upon his ancestor. Every time he tried to speak the Child-Emperor would merely scream louder to cover up the noise. Grover had reached the end of his patience. He thought that if he could just fly directly upward. . . and hit a rafter. . . he might be able to throw the pest off. But before he could put his “master” plan into motion, Grover saw another figure in the room. It was Benito, once again standing despite his wounds. Grover prepared himself for a duel once more. Sword-wielding child on his back or not he would not cease nor desist.\n\nBut Benito was not here to fight. He was leaning against the doorframe. Clearly still wounded from their first bout. He merely raised a paw at the young Emperor, who upon seeing his sworn protector and oldest friend halted his assault if only for a moment.\n\n“Grover. . . you must learn to respect your ancestors.” The dog was able to stand straighter, supporting himself on the blade Grover had tossed to him, “I think you owe a bit more courtesy to your great-great-grandfather. . .”"

Why not keep him as leverage, if anything?” Grover refused to believe the words of the traitor officer, staring the griffon down.\n\n“The Emperor had no real authority, he was a pawn of those who infested the rotting corpse of the Empire. The child had to be removed so the spirit of the Empire could live on. It is nothing personal.” Dawnclaw smiled proudly, having convinced himself that what he did was the right thing.\n\nFinally, this realisation dawned upon Grover as well. Before him kneeled an utterly twisted person. “Traitorous bastard, he was just a child, how dare you lay a talon on him!”\n\n“Surely you must know that all other considerations must be disregarded for the good of the Fatherland.” The traitor replied coldly, and Grover II gave up. In one fell swoop he grabbed the neck of Ferdinand and pulled him up, walking forward until the officer's wings were pressed against a wall. Then Grover II lifted his enemy from the ground as his hold around Dawnclaw's throat tightened.\n\nThe officer struggled against the Emperor, but there was little he could do. “You know nothing of sacrifice, traitor.” Grover II said before he smashed Ferdinand to the ground, holding him down with one paw before the broken traitor could even try and move. Sheeting his sword, Grover enjoyed the griffon squirming under him for a moment, before he started his gruesome punishment. With supernatural strength, his claws clasped the wings of the traitor, twisting them until they broke, turning Ferdinand's smug grin into a whimper. Even that was not enough, as the Emperor turned the griffon around and again pulled him up by the neck, removing the officer's Iron Cross and carrying him towards the chamber's window. “You. You took everything. May you suffer eternally, traitor.” With one throw, glass shattered, after which Ferdinand Dawnclaw sped towards a traitor's death in the mud.\n\nThe bedroom was quiet now, Grover's emotions turning from anger to pained sadness. “Boreas. . . Lords Above, why?” The reanimated corpse fell to his knees, shuddering, while the magic around him flickered a dim blue. “Why did you send me back too late, Boreas? Guto, gone. My blood. My own blood, taken! If you had given me a few months more I would have saved him. . .” He trembled, sniffling, but no tears came out. They could not. “Why. . ?” He repeated, again and again."

Guests from all over the continent and diplomats from beyond the sea took their seats, waiting for the ceremony to begin. All beings present stood up again, however, when the two Emperors entered the Temple, slowly striding past the guests, a banner-carrier preceding them with the imperial standard. The two Grovers proceeded to the front of the crowd, stepping up to the podium.\n\nGrover VI kneeled in front of his great-great grandfather, whose magical aura never seemed calmer than at this moment. The Conquering Emperor administered the oath of office for his successor. The young griffon dutifully recited his ancestor, promising to uphold the law and ancient rights and privileges of all the lands and citizens and to fiercely defend the Empire and the faith, like a good Emperor ought to do. When the oath was over, the petty kings of Aquileia and Wingbardy, being the most senior vassals of the Empire, stood up in unison and shouted “Long live the Emperor, hurrah!” After which the rest of the crowd followed. Then, the Archon of Boreas recited the pledge of allegiance to the vassals, who swore their loyalty, while outside, the Archon of Arcturius did the same for the gathered soldiers.\n\nWith the official part over, the Emperor went back to the Palace, where he appeared on the balcony above a roaring crowd.

Grover II made a short speech, thanking them all for their hard work, smiling gleefully as he recalled the difference between the frightened refugees who came to Bronzehill and the proud Imperials they had become.\n\nThen he and Grover VI entered the mountain tomb. Inside was, on one side, a living quarters, with all the amenities an emperor could need, a study room with many tomes and an armoury full of modern and classic weapons, amongst other things. The more ornate central part had a floor-mosaic depicting a map of the Griffonian Empire in painstaking detail. The stained glass panels on the walls depicted scenes from Grover IIs life, from smashing the first Aquileian rebellion, to welcoming the dogs into Bronzehill and reconquering the Empire for a second time. Across from the living area was a massive chamber, with rows and rows of griffon and dog statues of the Imperial Guard and all the servants an Emperor could want. All of this led up to the actual tomb, two marble sarcophagus set with the finest gemstones, surrounded by the finest statues. To the left the the Guto family, to the right, the Grovers. The left sarcophagus read ‘Giselda' and was closed, while the right one was still open.\n\nHaving observed all of it, Grover II put his claw on the young Emperor's shoulder. “They did an amazing job, didn't they?”\n\nGrover VI, who was closer to crying than to smiling, nodded. “We could leave it empty for a little while longer. . .

And if you feel unsure, put your faith in the Gods.”\n\nThe young griffon hugged him and his ancestor wished that his magical body could feel warm for once. “I love you.” The young Grover said, and the old one ruffled his feathers.\n\n“I love you too.

So, if you would indulge me, I would like to address a few words to you. In my lifetime, which has undoubtedly passed, many amazing discoveries have been made, for good and ill, out of lust for wealth and power, or for fear of the power of others. I hope you find yourself in more enlightened times than I do, but I fear that not much has changed in our basic mentality. I do hope my preparations for Yale have been of some aid to your efforts to break this cycle and use science to pursue peace.\n\nPerhaps, if I was lucky, you were taught in university that all scientists stand on the shoulders of those who came before and I would be most humbled if I were amongst those giants. However, this is not the entire truth. We stand on the shoulders of all beings, who in their labours provide the circumstances for us to move forwards. Scientific progress is not owed to scientists, but to the people that enable scientists to do their research. Thus, from this concludes that it is all of society that deserves the fruits of scientific progress.\n\nThis truth may seem self-evident, but if your journey as a leader has been the same as mine, you must have had many doubts. You could have let doubts about security and the things you hold dear get in the way of using the unique position you were given for the good of those who entrusted it to you. I sincerely thank you for having not given in to those desires even in your darkest hour and the hope of your people must be that you remain this strong.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJust one being, Borean Wiedergreiff.”\n\nThe Rector stared at the paper for a while, before smiling.

They had all applied for different battalions and branches of service, and it stood out to the captain that none of them seemed interested in a career as a staff officer. Schwertsohn nodded at the numbers, smiling. Perhaps Arcturius had visited these students in their dreams, and now they finally knew their true duty?\n\nWhatever the case, his shift was almost over and he wanted to see his wife. No griffon read his reports anyway, so there was no harm in leaving Cyrusval's new military fervour a secret for now. Captain Lars stuffed the papers into the filing cabinet, deciding not to report this curious abnormality further up the chain of command, instead going home early to his wife."

The room was packed with the machines and griffons necessary to mass produce pamphlets, leaflets and newspapers, which had taken a considerable chunk of the university budget. Erich Mühschnabel looked at the two papers on the table in front of him. Two different ideas for the first draft of ‘Wahrheit!' the underground newspaper that was supposed to come out tomorrow.\n\nOf course, Erich had made sure to put in local stories that would be interesting for any reader, to attract attention, but he was split over which of the two drafts to push to the presses. One had anonymous essays and lengthy exposes about the theoretical background of socialism and anarchism, truly works of fine scholarship. Interesting for some, but not a simple story a worker could rally behind. The other draft was the opposite, full of short, powerful articles about the capitalist crimes of the here and now, urging the worker to action. It was unworthy of journalism or academia, but it would resonate with the proletariat.\n\n The decision was up to Erich on how to set the tone for future editions and decide on his target audience. He cleaned his glasses, which had gotten damp from the moisty, sweaty room and called the griffon in charge of the presses."

More and more supporters have flocked to the woods on the border with Angriver, where the revolutionaries are trained in the Angriver way of guerrilla warfare. However, the veteran soldiers training these militias have complained that there is a lack of discipline amongst recruits and that many simply spend most of their time listening to students hold speeches on the evils of capitalism or discussing how they'd run a commune.\n\nAs expected by Mühschnabel, most delegates present found this a wonderful development, praising the rise of class consciousness amongst the griffons. However, more practical griffons reminded those present that, for now, it would be best to force camp discipline and train the revolutionaries into true soldiers. Opinions were split and it was going to be another long night of debates."

 YAL_SUCCESSFUL_MEETING:0 "Cyrusval University was a buzzling hive of activity tonight, with students and professors running around its halls with firearms, munitions, pamphlets, food and all manner of other things Rector Erich Mühschnabel never imagined would actually be needed for a revolution. He smirked, as the time was finally here, his father would see what he could do! Yale would follow so many other nations on the road to a classless society, there would be no more Theodores and no more Irenes. Freedom would be the highest goal and the revolution would not stop until every illegitimate hierarchy was brought down. No masters above you and no slaves below you, as it was simplified for the common griffon.\n\nIn Lecture Hall A-12, an impromptu headquarters, many radios and papers and plans were scattered around as enthusiastic students and professors went over the final details of the plan. Of course, it was futile to plan such a force of nature, but a coordinated general strike and the seizure of important government buildings would be paramount.\n\nAnother look at his supporters, the griffons he was charged to tutor and protect as a professor, made him realise the fragility of the whole thing. It was a small miracle that they hadn't been discovered yet. Which of his students and colleagues would Erich see again? How many souls were they sacrificing to Maar for an uncertain future? No. He could not doubt at this crucial juncture. When freedom and equality were concerned, no sacrifice was too high. He was this close to seeing everything he hated go up in flames. His father would not have the satisfaction of seeing him give up again. He would live in freedom or die fighting for it, as such was the right of every being. Tonight, he was a teacher, but tomorrow he would be a revolutionary!"

When he received a note on his desk about impending ‘revolution' from Cyrusval two days ago, he went on his own to investigate the report. Last night, more griffons came than went, and they went in with crates and sacks, and if they did come out of the university, they came out with empty claws. Now the captain had brought reinforcements, his most loyal troops, along with most of the local police force. If the university students he hoped had changed were really preparing a revolution, they would nip it in the bud.\n\nThe small force of loyalists made its way to the main entrance as stealthily as possible, until they were in front of the ornament oaken doors which hid the would be rebels. These doors were not strong enough to stop the police battering ram, however, and soon the soldiers stormed inside. The captain's perception changed to an adrenaline-induced blur. Some of the griffons inside, mostly young students, tried to open fire, but most ran or flew away at the sight of danger. Of course, captain Lars's birds were way better equipped and trained than these scholars and they were soon disposed of.\n\nAfterwards, it must have only taken a few minutes to reach the lecture hall which formed the centre of this hive of misguided younglings. The professors inside surrendered instantly and the traitors were promptly arrested. His companions remarked on the scale of the operation as they opened crates of food and supplies clearly marked for the army. For Schwertsohn, however, the most interesting things in the room were not the stolen firearms or the radios, but the many plans, ledgers and records the university had meticulously kept. Captain Lars's face changed into a concerned frown. Soldiers, low officers like himself, trade union leaders and even a few priests were on the lists. Those griffons, along with those who escaped the university tonight, could still pose a serious danger to Yale itself. He spat on the floor. To loud cheering, the captain swore on Boreas he'd rather die than let these stuck-up whiners take over his country."

Karl Legreif, the chairgriffon of the Federation of Yalish Unions, had the word for half an hour now. He was a gifted speaker, and he flared up the emotions of the crowd. Now he was getting to the end of his speech.\n\n“I would therefore commend the following resolution to you. ‘These Trade Unions, as representatives of the working class of Yale has no confidence in the Rector and his government,' ” Legreif was interrupted by shouts and sneers directed at the government, “ ‘Due to his failure to allow the people of Yale to have a meaningful impact on their own destiny and to allow them the rights and privileges every worker deserves. Therefore the Federation of Yalish Unions calls upon every worker, soldier and student to strike, until the government accepts our demands.' ” The griffon nodded his head and left the stage under loud applause.\n\nThe theatre had calmed down somewhat and the representatives were discussing the resolution. Many of them were scared that such an all-out action would result in fatalities or Imperial intervention. The workers didn't seem to put much faith in the students of Cyrusval to have organised enough arms to carry out a violent revolution and others did never intent to go that far. The next hours would be crucial to decide the FYU's decision. Legreif gathered a few sturdy metalworkers around him. These griffons could be trusted to put in their all for him.

In Cyrusval, the university along with the local workers had already taken control of most of the city. Karl Legreif and the rest of the FYU leadership quickly hurried over there for fear of being caught by the police or loyal army units.\n\nNow that the Trade Union leadership had fallen in line for the revolution, it was time to spread the word from the biggest cities to the smallest villages and to convince more soldiers and workers to join. All the while, the revolutionaries had to hide the extent of their plans to prevent the government from cracking down too harshly on the strike before it could organise. This meant that communication had to be somewhat secret, which meant bribes and intimidation if necessary. It was also not quite clear who supported the revolution in what manner and Legreif did not know whether he could count on union activists or soldiers to lead the way. A revolution was an uncontrollable force, and despite what the eggheads in the university might say, it was not possible to predict the exact outcome. "

More are flocking to the red and black banners every day. The State is in disarray and trying to gauge the scale of the situation.

Today, the scene was quite different. A sea of tents had occupied ‘Black Square' as it was now called. The statue of Grover had been toppled and now adorned one of the barricades securing the square from the forces of the reaction. Black and red flags replaced the statue as decoration. Thousands of griffons occupied the square and a spirit of freedom had overtaken them. Many hours were spend debating, singing or practicing with guns.\n\nMeanwhile, most students stayed in Greenback University, a lot of them feeling an obligation to its hospital over fighting on either side of the revolution. The army of Yale, or whatever was left of the army, had not reared its head in the city-centre, content to guard the government sector of the city. Until today, that was. From one of the barricades a trumpet blared an alarm sound. The high spirits of the revolutionaries shattered like glass. A moment of silence was followed by a flurry of action. Rifles were quickly given out as the griffons sprinted and flew towards where the alarm came from.\n\nAn orderly column of about 300 troops stopped before the barricades. The soldiers had brought artillery and heavy weapons. All of them were standing at attention, their rifles shouldered. From the mount of rubble in front of them, a few hundred weapons pointed at them. Both sides hesitated, there were friends, maybe even family on the other side. No griffon wanted to fire the first shot. An eerie silence was in the air, the calm before the storm. . ."

There sounded a lone gunshot, then a cry of pain, breaking the fragile truce.\n\n“Fire at will!” The captain shouts and soon the sound of weapons drowned out the shouts of pain.\n\nThe captain soon got reinforcements as the battle escalated, while the revolutionaries carried their wounded down to Black Square for treatment. The firefight continued until nightfall, when the army retreated, seemingly content to shell the barricades with artillery. The black flag was still firmly planted on top of the barricade the soldiers tried to take over and despite the losses, revolutionary morale was high, for they had received word from Cyrusval that their comrades were incoming from the east. They only had to hold out a little longer.\n\nIt wasn't just the revolutionaries that had caught wind of the incoming reinforcements, the military had as well. They had to act fast if they wanted to secure victory. So, the soldiers laboured throughout the night, sneaking into position through the buildings surrounding the barricades, preparing for a final assault. When dawn came, they fixed their bayonets and leaped out of the windows onto the barricades.\n\nThe fighting was vicious, griffon to griffon in close combat. Both sides were desperate for victory on that pile of rubble. And as the sun rose higher, the fighting died down as the revolutionaries that were left stumbled down towards the square, leaving the barricade to the soldiers. The battered remnants of the Yalish army reached the top of the hill, one of them planting the national flag on top of the barricade. The army had prevailed, they just had to clear the square!\n\nBut despite their valiant effort, the soldiers had not achieved victory soon enough. They would not receive reinforcement and they'd never clear Black Square. Instead of their fellow soldiers, the few dozen griffons that had conquered the barricades were greeted by the revolutionaries from Cyrusval. It did not take long to break their resistance, after which the fresh anarchist students flew towards the government quarters, only to find that the most important griffons had already fled. The capital of Yale had fallen to the revolution, but the war was not over yet."

None could have expected it to happen so soon. While the formation of soldiers advanced towards the barricade, shadows appeared beneath them. When some of the griffons looked up it was already too late. Students of Greenback's Medical University descended upon them with reckless abandon, wielding scalpels, bone saws and other tools of their trade. The surgical strike turned the balance of the battle and what remained of the military presence on that street routed, leaving valuable artillery pieces to the revolutionaries.\n\nAs the socialists celebrated on Black Square, the medical students were grim-faced and seemed less than happy with victory. Instead they went to work, treating the wounded of both sides equally. Some were seen praying for forgiveness when they had a moment of respite from their duties and the rest of the revolutionaries did not have the heart to disturb those that broke their oaths to grant victory to the anarcho-socialist revolution. A day later, reinforcements arrived from Cyrusval, linking up the heart of the revolution with the former capital. The rest of the city was secured with relatively minor fighting, as most army units and police officers had departed the city with the government. The battle for Greenback was over, but the statist government was not crushed yet."

Two hundred claws loosened their grips on a hundred guns as a single silhouette emerged from the barricade, flying down at top speed towards the army unit. Many soldiers looked up with disbelief, one clumsily salutes the griffon, for it was none other than Colonel Arthur Eyrsohn, their commander. He was wearing civilian clothing, but it was unmistakably the griffon who had led some of them their entire careers. He stopped a few metres short of the soldiers, some of whom hesitantly pointed their rifles at the officer. Even without his uniform, he was imposing, armed but with a simple pistol.\n\n“Arhur, uhm, Sir! What are you doing with the reds?” Captain Valerion asked, his voice quivering in shock.\n\n“I am fighting for my people, captain. What are you doing?” The Colonel's voice was dignified, and both sides held their breath for the officer's answer.\n\n“Just following orders Sir. You are occupying our square. For Boreas' sake you are trying to overthrow the government!”\n\nThe former colonel stood still, his eyes gazing into those of his former subordinate. “Valerion. The Empire treated us as chattel! All the wars for redrawing some maps and enriching some griffons we never met. Friend, our enemy is not on the other side of some line in the sand. Our enemies are the ones who told you to shoot me. The ones who say they can decide who lives and who dies.”\n\nThe captain was silent, staring to his former commander, then up at the barricade full of the people, then back at his unit. He could see the fear in their eyes. They did not want to die today. Not for this. He closed his eyes, murmuring “We're all getting hanged for this.” And then, loudly. “You served your country well, soldiers of Yale. Now I intend to serve the people instead.”\n\nNot much later, the two ex-officers radioed a message across military channels, calling on all soldiers in the city to join the revolution. The call seemed to frighten the government, which fled the city as fast as they could, along with those soldiers they still trusted to do their duty. The anarchists let them go, celebrating the victory with the garrison.  A victory where the streets did not turn as red as their banners."

Then again and then a third time just before the first shells hit their target. The sound of the explosions was faint from such a distant, but Lars could see the effects up close. The city's half-timbered houses were not made to withstand an artillery barrage of this magnitude. He gnarled in annoyance. “Cursed command owes me a new house after this is done.”\n\n“You live her Schwertsohn?” The other asked, only half-interested. “Yes, despite all the socialists it was a good place, fine folks.”\n\n“We'll rebuild it, maybe rename it to Rotsende or something. I'm sure the Emperor will appreciate our sacrifice.”\n\n“Rather him than those red thieving traitors, they kicked me out of my house!”\n\n“It is quite something they still managed to revolt when you caught their leaders.”\n\n“Bloody bureaucracy, Valerion.

Luckily I had the ringleaders shipped away that very night.”\n\n “That would never have happened under the Empire.”\n\n“Boreas gave us victory over the godsless, only to go back to the paper-obsessed eggheads.”\n\n“Doesn't have to be that way, Schwertsohn.

They had empowered Cyrusval with extra funds, naively hoping to forge an alliance with those that hated everything a decent griffon stands for. Many officers and soldiers openly expressed their desire to return control of Yale to the rightful heir of the Empire.\n\nThe newspapers and radio whipped up a red scare amongst the commoners, aided by the Triarchy and the military. Day after day every griffon was told of the imminent threat to their possessions and to decency, science and religion posed by whatever socialists still remained.  Soon mass demonstrations were held for immediate re-integration of Yale to the Empire. Not long after, the Rector Magnificus ceremoniously renounced the title of Duke of Yale, which was held by the Universities since the age of Borean Wiedergreiff.

As for all their dedication to the revolution, most griffons remained religious and they have not dared to touch their places of worship. This faith is starting to be used against the socialists, however, as under orders from Prelate Michael, the clergy has started to ramp up its fight against the revolution. During every sermon, the priests of the country remind their congregation that the revolution is godless. Some go as far as to accuse us of worshipping Maar! Worst of all, it seems the Triarchy's words are starting to stick in the minds of the proletariat, leading them right into reactionary claws.\n\nThe revolutionaries have yet to decide on their response. Although the student, soldier and workers councils were quick to condemn the temples' allegations, most griffons are hesitant to take any further action. Revolution is a messy process and everything depends on popular support. Action against the temples, many feared, was sure to be unpopular. Some griffons floated the idea of making counterpropaganda, but many of our writers protested against directly challenging the word of the Triarchy. Only a few griffons supported armed intervention, but such a radical step would require our soldiers to shed blood on holy ground, something we are not sure they are prepared to do.

Is fighting ancient injustices to be a Maarite? Is it godless to not accept oppression and exploitation?\n\nAmong the students are many who have read the religious and historical texts as well as any priest, and who savagely beat back their accusations, pointing out the historical hypocrisies in their words and how they are twisting the dogma they are meant to enforce to make stuff up.\n\nThe temples are being dragged through the mud and while some reactionaries and misguided proletarians are still clinging to them, their wider support is steadily evaporating."

One even tried to barricade himself and shoot anygriff who entered.

Barricades were reinforced and machine guns were moved to create kill-zones, especially along the rooftops, where sandbag positions were being constructed.\n\nDown on the road, a beefy Sergeant - once a mere janitor but now elevated to bossing his fellow militiagriffs around - was loudly driving the griffons around him to work harder, cursing them out with every insult in the dictionary. His abuse could be heard even up in the tower by the temple, where two griffons were watching the horizon, sniper rifles in claw.\n\n"That's the way of doing it, isn't it?" One of them remarked sarcastically. "The reds are creeping closer and closer, and he's still obsessed with waving his dick around.\n\n"Way of the world, no?" her companion up in the tower said sarcastically. "Some have power to boss others around, some will just have to suck it up?"\n\n"True that... only a couple of minutes until they're here," the first griffon commented as she looked through her sniper rifle."\n\n"Think we'll survive?" the other griffin asked, watching below as griffons were getting ready by the barricades, the sound of gunfire slowly crept closer and closer.\n\n"Dunno, I know one thing though..." the first griffon said, getting more comfortable to shoot better. \n\n"What's that?"\n\n"Fuck that guy." With that, the sniper blew out the sergeant's brains with one precise shot, her compatriot doing the same with the lieutenant. All around the city center, the commanding griffons were taken out by the dozens in one fell swoop, throwing the defences of the city into disarray. When they reds hit the barricades, they came face to face with surprised and shocked militiagriffs that - leaderless and confused - ended up surrendering in minutes."

Somewhere, debate and reason had turned to war and fanaticism. It all made so little sense, and he was so wrapped up in it that he didn't notice the student that came into his office before the young griffon stood in front of his desk, clearing her throat. Startling, he looked up at her in shock.\n\n"What are you doing here?" he asked. "Who let you in?"\n\n"I did, sir" the young student answered, causing Mikusian's blood to freeze in his veins and glance towards the window. "Don't run sir, we've got the building surrounded. It won't help." Her words left Mikusian forcing himself to relax and sigh. "Are you here to kill me? If so, just do it, a grandstanding monologue will be wasted on me if I am about to die."\n\n"I don't want to kill you sir, I want to give you this." She handed him a large stack of papers. "It is from Comrade Muhschnabel. He implores you to see reason and and end this fight."\n\n"That seems a lot of papers for a short message," Mikusian asked, raising an eyebrow.\n\n"You always said a good student shows his work," the student answered. "The revolutionary armies will attack in a couple of days time. If comrade Muhschnabel's argument can convince you, then you can save hundreds of lives. Also... you said once that it is the sign of a frail mind to cling to falsehood when truth is readily apparent." With that, the young griffon left the room and Mikusian was left staring down at the paper in front of him. In the end he began reading. Muhschnabel's loquacious style was evident, but cutting past that, there were arguments, there was rigor, and there was a conclusion... Or rather two conclusions. Not only were the socialists surrounding the city and had infiltrated it, but the work in front of him spoke clearly as well. Mikusian saw the gesture in it and realized there was nothing else to do.\n\nBy the morning, he officially ordered the Yale garrison to stand down."

Mikusian asked the griffon as the Chief Constable put his hat to his chest and gave a salute.\n\n"Yes Sir... the citizens have launched a general strike across the city. The tram network is not moving, the roads have been blocked and all communications are down. I have dispatched policegriff and militias to try to secure the radio station and the main roads, but demonstrators are blocking our progress."\n\n"The socialists are in the city?" Mikusian demanded. "Then why are you not fighting in the streets to clear the path? Their army is drawing close as we speak!"\n\n"Sir, the protestors are unarmed..."\n\n"So?!"\n\n"Their families won't be, sir, and neither are the militias. They have family among the demonstrators, and if we open fire... I cannot guarantee that my men would stay loyal. Even if they did though, that doesn't matter, not with the socialist army approaching."\n\n"So what you are telling me... is that either we surrender, or we attempt to restore order, turn the people against us and are slaughtered for it...?"

The outer dormitories had long since fallen, one of them having been reduced to rubble by artillery. Further in, the bridge over the campus brook was covered by the bodies of fallen griffons where machine gun nests in the medical building had mowed them down by the dozens. Said building was currently set ablaze by molotovs, and the screams of the trapped militias was met with only death as they tried to escape the building and being mowed down in revenge.\n\nAt the main building, revolutionary fighters had encircled it, firing at the entrenched defenders and using improvised smoke bombs to cover the assault on the main door, where the reds were finally breaking down the barricades. As they stormed the building, they left the cornered militias fighting room by room in a desperate, but ultimately futile last stand.\n\nIn the end, when the entire first floor had fallen, they were starting to run low on both ammunition and willpower, but the reds gave no quarter. Behind them an entire city stood in ruins. The outskirts of the city were scarred, the city center devastated, and fire and death was everywhere. Hundreds of griffons lay dead, reds and reactionaries both, and after days of brutal fighting they had no mercy left to give.\n\nSlaughtering every last griffon they could find, even the last deans and professors that had taken cover up there, they made sure no one was going to remain to ever hurt the revolution again. Blood slowly ran across the marble floor, dripping down the stairs, as exhausted revolutionaries more or less stumbled onto the balcony of the Rector Magnificus' office, unfurling the red banner and waving it back and forth, while at the same time being treated to the sight of a broken city that was little more than ruins and fire."

The people of Yale are finally free to take their due and distribute the wealth of the land amongst the people. Now the griffons of Yale can live together in freedom.\n\nErich Mühschnabel has led the anarchist revolution, not only has he achieved the goal of liberation, he has also enacted personal revenge. The rector of old Cyrusval University walked through the burned out ruins of the mansion where he spent his childhood. As he had planned, his family was one of the first to go. His sister, who always had his father's attention was gone. Father's final moments would be imprinted with Erich's greatest achievement. For a capitalist, the old Mühschnabel was kind to his workers, sure. But that did not stop Erich from inciting a crowd to burn down their boss's home.\n\nAs Erich walked through the remains of a once decadent salon, he pondered on the future. Yale was properly cleansed of any elements that could stop anarchism from taking hold. His students and teachers were already educating the people for their new way of life. Two things still distinctly worried him. Firstly, the other powers in the Heartland might see the Communes, rightly so at the moment, as an easy target and attempt to quench the flame of revolution in the name of some misguided principle.\n\nSecondly, the trade unions. Ally to the cause, these organisations were not as radical as Erich had hoped. Many high-ranking members believed in pampering the people instead of liberating them. Even now they were arguing for the merits of hierarchical education, labour organisation and military. Now, it was up to Erich to help the griffons to carry on with their own liberation and not succumb to the temptation of returning to a save hierarchy.\n\nComrade Erich spat on the ground where his father's chair used to be. “I am going to see this through all the way.”"

At first we tried to cooperate with the little bourgeoisie, but they were reluctant to hand over their businesses, preferring to keep operating in the old ways. Technicians and managers were often scarce, so initially, managing factories with sophisticated machinery turned out to be difficult. Unions tried to replace the fled management but union leaders often gave contradictory instructions, causing confusion and delay. However, there was a lot of good will amongst those liberated, so the workers carried on, organising their own management of their workplaces and carrying on with the jobs they knew how to do.\n\nThe students of the universities were a great help. Without the constraints of competition and private ownership, they were free to implement scientific models of production to help compensate for those missing. Without bureaucracy, perhaps more wrong decisions are being made, but they are being made a lot faster and by the griffons who actually know about the issue at claw directly.\n\nAll in all, the transformation has been dramatic in speed and thoroughness. Some vestiges of the old system still remain, some griffons stubbornly clinging on to their money and employment, while the rest enjoys the newfound joy in enjoying the sweat of their brow. Local communities are helping each other out and it turns out that the social bonds between beings is strong enough to function without the hierarchy imposed by a capitalist mode of production. There are still abuses and disagreements, but largely the unshackling of the economy has been a success."

But to ensure their success, the University of Bruma, which recently invited Prelate Michael onto their Executive Board, carefully planned their next step. Many griffons still questioned Sword and Shield, especially those griffons who were swayed by the false promises of Equestrian ideas such as socialism and harmony.\n\nThere was one griffon, however, who could help shore up support for the cause, even though he was not the greatest fan of public appearances. Archon Proteus, highest in the priesthood of Arcturius and Michael's superior, would remind the griffons of Yale of their duty to their gods. Bruma University would invite Proteus for a visit to inspect and bless the standard of a new regiment for the student militia. Hopefully that would entice the Archon, who sometimes acted more like a knight than a priest, to come and support the Sword and Shield movement.

Apparently, the Archon is to bless the standard of a new regiment for the local student militia. Although this invitation seems harmless, it is a sign of the renewed influence of religion in general and the worship of Arcturius in particular throughout the Yale Rectorate.

Firstly, the Archon appeared on the balcony of the city hall, to roaring cheers of the crowd. The chivalrous and down-to-earth Proteus was immensely popular with the public and many travelled for hours just to catch a glimpse of him. Behind him, at a respectable distance, Prelate Michael took his position, smiling at the crowd's adoration for the Archon. Proteus seemed to instantly connect to the griffons present, making them forget everything else.\n\nThe sound of military drums closing on the square silenced the crowd, and from around the corner, the Sword and Shield militia marched into the square. They were wearing their grey dress uniform, lined with golden thread and a grey cap with a white plume supplemented their formal attire. In front walked the standard bearer, carrying a golden banner depicting a sword behind a shield, surrounded by a laurel wreath. On the banner it said: ‘Virtus, Justitia, Arcturius.' When the student militia had reached its positions, they formally greeted the Archon, after which the square was silent, waiting for the Archon's speech.\n\n“Thank you, citizens of Yale, for inviting me on this beautiful day. Your Prelate has asked me to say a few words to you and I will. As you know, Arcturius always had a special place in his heart for Bruma and your university has produced many wonderful knights and priests.” The crowd cheered at the Archon's praise and he had to gesture them to calm down. “However, I have been told that not every griffon in Yale has decided to follow the divine path. Many are confused and lost in these uncertain times, where the world seems small but the challenges to our wellbeing loom large. But remember that Arcturius will fight for those in need. I implore you, follow the God's call and safe those who stray too far. Then Yale's future, and that of the Empire, will be secure!”\n\nAfter the Archon was done speaking, he was joined by Prelate Michael and they chanted a hymn to bless the Sword and Shield banner. Proteus then spent the rest of the day chatting with soldiers and students and even tested out one of their rifles himself. News of the Archon's speech spread quickly and many griffons heeded the words of Proteus.

The social scientists of Bruma understood the wants of the people more than the others, more even than Cyrusval, which always proclaimed they were the only ones who fought for the citizenry.\n\nIt was this slow change of perspective, along with a personal letter of recommendation from Archon Proteus, published in every major newspaper, that forced the Council to make a move. The rectors invited prelate Michael, head of the Arcturian Hierarchy in Yale for negotiations. When the prelate arrived in Greenback's Borean Wiedergreiff Building, the Council saw a griffon who would not be impressed by their power and intellect.\n\nMost strikingly, the prelate was reasonable, way more reasonable than a priest ever should have been. He would keep respecting the universities if he was on the council, but simply give a voice to the divine and popular will. He swore that a seat on the council would finally mend the rift between the elite and the common griffon and most of all, he promised the Archonate would respect Yale's tradition if it was led by Michael.\n\nIn the end, the council voted in favour of allowing Michael into the council, with only protests from Cyrusval."

He has offered to leverage his considerable popularity and act as our figurehead. With such a familiar face representing the Rectorate, the current level of visceral hatred would rapidly melt away. Although some raise the objection that Mr. Ravioli would contribute little of ideological substance, none dispute that he would calm things down massively.\n\nGeorgina Fredrika Schüler, leader of the harmonist New Sparkle Movement, argues that the root of our problems lies deeper than public relations. She claims that a clear disregard for the well-being of common griffons is what prompted them to agitate.

Even the errant vassals of Wingbardy and Aquilea could be seen, a bold statement for an Empire that was in decline so recently. And there were legions upon legions, line after line of soldiers and knights arrayed before the Imperial Palace. It was as if I was looking into my past.\n\n“ARCTURIUS ERHALTE DER KAISER!” they cried out again and again, their voices echoing through the winding streets of the capital. These griffons had lacked true leadership, they lacked a cause.\n\nI walked among the soldiers with the honour guard, carefully studying the regiments one by one, inspecting their standards. They were original trophies from my father's conquests wherever we could find them. So much has changed and yet so much has stayed the same. The methods change, but the spirit remains. These soldiers still have the same spark in their eyes that they used to have, how many of their ancestors did I fight with? The griffons will have ample time to proof themselves.\n\n Then rumbling from overhead. It wasn't thunder, but the imperial airforce showing their newfound strength. After that I inspected the panzers, machines sure to change the nature of war. Their shadows loomed large over the Kaiserplatz, a square which had seen countless of these ceremonies.\n\nFinally I rose to the balcony, using my newfound power to be audible for all. “The Empire has been reborn. No longer are we seen as the Sick Bird of Griffonia, but rather a mighty phoenix, risen from the ashes towards a great new era. We are the heirs of Boreas, we are the children of Arcturius and Eyr's chosen. Griffonia is our birth right. The enemy will bend, or they will break!” Outside, my voice is amplified by loudspeakers. Thousands of griffons raise their rifles. Dozens of standards are held high. Oaths are taken. So it was, and so it is again."

After casting the ballot, the griffon closed his eyes, and his heart stopped beating then and there.\n\nVoting results from the far edges of the Heartlands are still coming in, but Georgina Fredrika Schüler, the lead candidate for the broad harmonic New Spark Party, seemingly managed to gain a plurality of the votes, as citizens rewarded her party for actually managing to force the organisation of elections in the first place. It seemed the National Republican Party, which held more Pan-Griffionian ambitions, got side-lined by the localist New Spark Party.\n\nHowever, it was clear that Schüler would need to enter into a coalition with either the social democrats or the conservatives, although it is still unclear if both parties would manage to gain enough seats to help the harmonists to a majority on their own. The former has campaigned on a more left-wing social security program than the harmonists, while the conservatives have rallied in a bid to restore some semblance of monarchy.

It was the first election for the fledgling republic, and the last attempt at democracy ended in more bloodshed. Now the New Sparkle had to win the hearts of its citizens and deliver on its promises.\n\nDespite some of Griffenheim's Georgina Schüler stepped out to the balcony to roaring applause, followed by the social democratic leader and a priest to administer the oath of office. The priest repeated a pledge to the harmonic leader, words which she had written herself. A pledge to protect the constitution. To ensure prosperity and safety for all citizens. A pledge to defend the Republic with all her might. So help her Almighty Boreas.\n\nWith the formality done, the newly minted President turned to address the crowd. “Herzlanders, citizens, thank you for coming out today. The first election of our new Republic was a powerful moment, and I am honoured to serve as your first President. Those who believe in progress and peace rejoice, for we have a unique opportunity to come together and secure peace in our Heartlands! Some of you may believe in something else, and desire a different outcome, to you I promise that we will hear your voices as well, and try to work with the largest possible majority. Gods bless you and Gods bless Herzland, May we live together in Harmony!”\n\nThe speech elicited another applause, and this time the more conservative voters were also on board, cheering for the President. They weren't fully convinced, but the young griffon's speech at least made them give her a chance. After President Schüler, her vice-president, Gerben Kogchel, the social-democrat, also had his say. The Feathisian promised prosperity and security. He pledged to work tirelessly to rebuild the Herzland after the unification war and that soon no griffon would go hungry.\n\nAfter the speeches, many parties were held across the Herzland to celebrate the inauguration.

When they arrived before his throne, the dog bowed before Grover, while the Chancellor-Elect merely nodded. “Your Majesty, the people have elected their representatives to the Reichstag and have given us the mandate to request you to form a government.” The griffon's voice was neutral. Grover had read about her ideas, and he guessed that she was not happy with having the monarchy retain a place in the Herzland. Meanwhile Count Ignatius seemed to be delighted to be in the palace.\n\n“The Throne has noted the wishes of its subjects, Miss Schüler, Count Ignatius.” Grover spoke the words from his mind, he had spent the last day rehearsing his role. “In accordance with the Basic Law, I ask you to form my Government. Therefore I bestow you the office of Reichskanzler and Vizekanzler of the Herzland. The Throne will look forward to your wise contributions to governing the nation.”\n\nChancellor Schüler managed to smile as she raised her claw for the oath, “I humbly accept the office bestowed upon me and I swear to faithfully serve the Kingdom.”\n\nThe Count raised his paw solemnly “I humbly accept the honour of the office of Vice-Chancellor and I swear I will continue to serve you faithfully, my King.”\n\nThe young Emperor let out a heavy sigh and relaxed in his seat, looking sideways at Benito, the old Imperial Guard. “Did I do well?”\n\n“Perfect, your Majesty!” The dog replied.\n\n“Good, now make sure the Lady and Gentledog get all the help we can spare.

But Mikusian knew it was possible. It had to be possible! It was his dream, just as it had been the dream of Borean Wiedergreiff.\n\n"My friends," began Mikusian, "I come before you during a glorious occasion. The darkness of ignorance which once hung over Griffonia has finally been dispelled by our efforts!" The other council members applauded respectfully. "The formation of the Herzland Rectorate marks a great triumph for rationality, but our work has only just begun. We must gather the most skilled and knowledgeable from all across the land to aid us, so that we may best serve the citizens of Herzland. Once the people see the fruits of a scientific society, I know they will embrace us!" At his conclusion, heartier cheers rose up from the council.\n\nAlthough he spoke with certainty, Mikusian had inner doubts. The council could rule fairly and wisely, but would they ever be accepted?

Mikusian turned his head to see Eckhart Drasten jovially pounding the table. The Romauan economist saw that he had Mikusian's attention, and spoke. "Rector! Weigh in on this, Rector," he said with a crooked grin. "My poor, misguided friend here seems not to believe in the rule of law!" Drasten gestured dismissively toward the griffon at his other side. Mikusian recognised her as Fiona Schmitz, a respected lawyer from Griffing.\n\n"What I actually said was that I do not believe in rule BY law," Schmitz interrupted, annoyed. "When the law is used to control the people, rather than free them." She leaned forward slightly, eyes focused on the Rector. She seemed very curious to hear his response.\n\n"Miss Schmitz, I can tell you that I am absolutely committed to preserving liberty. It is my foremost priority to guarantee that every creature has the opportunity to develop their skills and reach their full potential." Mikusian was resolute and spoke with practiced authority.

Some of the greatest scientists were laughed at when they first proposed their ground-breaking visions and now they're in your textbooks. One more!”\n\n “A scientist must be apolitical and not like those reds in Cyrusval!” The hall erupted into laughter, which faded away when Mikusian raised a claw.\n\n“This comes back to what I said earlier. Seeing the world from just one perspective and contributing the root cause of all evil to one phenomenon might be reductionist, but science is not apolitical. It cannot be, as it is involved with the most important advancements in how our society functions. How you will use your knowledge and intellect might determine the wellbeing of millions. Be mindful of your responsibility and have a great evening!” The Rector raised his claw again, indicating the class was dismissed."

 yale.87.d:0 "“And that faith is a rock standing tall in the sea, whether in the calm embrace of summer or the raging tempest of winter, it will never waver, as it is anchored to the earth. For beneath the waves, there is more than meets the eye.”\n\nTristan thanked all the griffons for attending and blessed their day in the name of the gods, marking the end of today's service. The templegoers stood up from their benches and slowly made their way to the exit as the priest himself relaxed his posture, hanging his shoulders as he watched the few faithful leave his temple. The young grey-feathered priest looked up at the stained glass window above the exit, breaking down the afternoon sun into an array of playful colours.\n\nCyrusval's temple to the Trinity did not show any signs of the slow decay happening around its walls. The red rot of socialism had taken root, spreading its venom house by house through the streets of this once noble city. And while Cyrusval was the epicentre, it was not the only community straying from the Trinity. Ever since Tristan came here from Bischofheim he felt it in the air, and in the eyes of the griffons he met on the street. This country had no soul, or if it had one, it was clouded in shadow. As the months passed by, fewer and fewer griffons visited the temple, except for the elderly coming in out of habit more than piety.\n\nTristan turned his eyes towards the heavens, a familiar fresco making him turn a slight smile. Yale was not yet completely lost. The priest quickly prayed a prayer to the prelate in Bruma, whose temple was filled to the brim with students and commoners both. He was not a griffon of compromise, Prelate Michael, as to be expected of an Arcturian priest. In his writings to the priesthood, the prelate often advocated for rooting out the red threat by banning Cyrusval University. In Yale's current climate of misguided academic faithlessness, such calls have never been answered by the Rectorate's rulers, but many others did listen devotedly.\n\nMaybe there was hope yet. . . The priest cringed at his own thoughts. Faith is a rock, and this long winter it would weather too. "

#Decisions
 YAL_university_focused_research:0 "Research Focus Program"
 YAL_university_focused_research_desc:0 "An effort to focus research in particular fields by directing scientists from different universities in a centralised manner is increasing the speed at which we can conduct Research and Development operations."
 YAL_equipment_focus:0 "Focus on Personal Weapon Development"
 YAL_equipment_focus_desc:0 "Infantry are still the primary fighting force of any nation and they are equipped with small arms. Rifles, machine guns, mortars, grenades and anti-tank weaponry in the claws of sturdy soldiers will win any conflict."
 YAL_infantry_focus:0 "Focus on Special Forces"
 YAL_infantry_focus_desc:0 "Our country does not have the griffons to spare to fill an army of general soldiers. Our armed forces must be honed precisely to operate under any condition. For this we must devise gruelling training programs, specialised equipment, and light weaponry for use in amphibious, high altitude and air landing operations."
 YAL_support_focus:0 "Focus on Support Equipment"
 YAL_support_focus_desc:0 "Our research is focused on improving the design of our support equipment. The small things such as recon equipment, shovels, radios, and field hospitals can prove decisive in combat. Using knowledge from the army itself, along with theory and doctrine, we will be able to make a decisive push in this field."
 YAL_artillery_focus:0 "Focus on Artillery Research"
 YAL_artillery_focus_desc:0 "The adage of the imperial military has always been that Arcturius is on the side with the most artillery. This is not an unwise statement, as those who can bring the most firepower to bear on an enemy will surely have a decisive advantage. With larger caliber rounds, advanced explosive or armour piercing ammunitions, we will be able to enhance the killing potential of our support weapons."
 YAL_land_doctrine_focus:0 "Focus on Army Doctrine"
 YAL_land_doctrine_focus_desc:0 "A soldier that is not present on the battlefield is as useful as a dead griffon. Waging war is a logistical operation of an unprecedented scale and the strategy behind our campaigns will have to be carefully considered. By adapting from lessons learned by generals from all over the world, we will be able to improve our own doctrine."
 YAL_industry_focus:0 "Focus on Industrial Development"
 YAL_industry_focus_desc:0 "Ultimately a war is won by the amount of griffons we will be able to arm, the amount of planes and tanks we will be able to construct, and the resources we will be able to extract. Therefore the most effective increase to our capacity to wage war will come through improving our assembly lines, extraction tools, and countrywide logistical operations."
 YAL_racial_focus:0 "Focus on Griffology"
 YAL_racial_focus_desc:0 "The griffon body and mind, and the magic feats it can produce are an untapped well of research. Enchanting could strengthen modern armour and make our weapons and tools more efficient. Magic and science can be melded together to create spectacular results with many practical implications."
 YAL_armor_focus:0 "Focus on Panzer Research"
 YAL_armor_focus_desc:0 "Armoured warfare is the future, as the speed, firepower and protection a tank offers is unrivalled by more traditional weapons. However, the potential improvements to these weapon platforms are clear. Better guns, smart anti-personnel weaponry, and the integration of electronic technologies will pave the way to victory."
 YAL_electronics_focus:0 "Focus on Electronics Research"
 YAL_electronics_focus_desc:0 "Although electricity, as a power source, is not new, technology powered by it keeps advancing. Most curious are the implications for long range detection technology which could warn of approaching hostiles and the usage of electromechanical computers to solve mathematical equations."
 YAL_naval_focus:0 "Focus on Ship Design"
 YAL_naval_focus_desc:0 "Our nation did not traditionally possess an oceangoing navy, but now that it borders the sea, it is imperative that we copy and improve naval designs to build our own fleet. The RFP will contribute to our new and modern navy."
 YAL_naval_doctrine_focus:0 "Focus on Naval Doctrine"
 YAL_naval_doctrine_focus_desc:0 "Without a destination, no wind is favourable, thus we must direct our navy or it will simply fall apart in a real combat situation. Developing doctrines for this new naval program will be challenging, as combat takes place beneath the waves, on the seas and above it. We will have to devise a strategy to match our ambitions and our potential opponents."
 YAL_air_focus:0 "Focus on Aeroplane Design"
 YAL_air_focus_desc:0 "Airplanes have a role to play in new conflicts. Aircraft design is advances at a rapid pace, however, and the Research Focus Program can assist in providing our own designs. More nimble and better armed fighter planes or bombers able to deliver more payload, different design philosophies can lead to radically different planes and we ought to make the planes that suit our needs."
 YAL_air_doctrine_focus:0 "Focus on Air Doctrine"
 YAL_air_doctrine_focus_desc:0 "The unique properties of airpower require a separate doctrine to set it apart from land -or in our case, non-mechanised flying- forces. The ability to project force quickly and reach over enemy frontlines into their heartlands bring new strategic considerations to the table. We must carefully consider how to use our air force in the way that will suit our military objectives."
 YAL_alliance:0 "Propose An Alliance To [From.GetNameDef]"
 YAL_alliance_desc:0 "We cannot stand alone against the Empire. If we do not cooperate with other secessionists, we will be broken by the Empire's might! Therefore we must seek allies who are ready to stand by our side against [GRI.GetLeader] and their lackeys."

 YAL_historical_materialism_desc:0 "History used to be the profession of nationalists, embellishing the myths of their ancient nations to distract the griffons from their own exploitation. The Faculty will unmask this history and show a radically different outlook. The world is ruled by modes of production, which structure a class system. And the age of capitalism is reaching its end..."
 YAL_verelendung_thesis:0 "The Verelendung Thesis"
 YAL_verelendung_thesis_desc:0 "With machines replacing griffons in the production line, production increases, but wages stagnate. Capital accumulates at the top, but workers grow less and less necessary. Once proud artisans are now little more than cogs in an oppressive machine. The true contradiction of capitalism is thus: The economy grows larger, but the worker's condition, as a necessity, becomes more miserable."
 YAL_reject_transition:0 "Reject Transition"
 YAL_reject_transition_desc:0 "The most accepted communist theories, such as those practiced in Stalliongrad, favour a post-revolutionary ‘dictatorship of the proletariat'. Sadly, our comrades overseas seem to have forgotten about the temporary nature of this arrangement. To ensure that the revolution is not perverted at the final hour, we will return all means of production and power to the workers."
 YAL_free_association:0 "Free Association"
 YAL_free_association_desc:0 "The state is the premier means of oppression. If there is to be true liberty, even the most liberal of democracies will not do. Only a community of freely associated individuals can guarantee the freedom that is the right of every being. Production will be in the hands of the workers and there will be no structures of power forcing anygriffon to do anything they don't want."
 YAL_support_underground_press:0 "Set up Underground Presses"
 YAL_support_underground_press_desc:0 "The extra funding from the Academic Council can be put to good use by buying printing presses. With these machines, we will be able to print large amounts of propaganda.

 YAL_start_building_part_1:0 "The Foundation"
 YAL_start_building_part_1_desc:0 "Mathematics are the foundation of the sciences, and without them we would not know about the true nature of the world. But just like we can base our science on sturdy mathematics, so too must the Archives be built on an unshakeable foundation. Let us begin in earnest!"
 YAL_start_building_part_2:0 "The Framework"
 YAL_start_building_part_2_desc:0 "A steel and concrete framework will hold up the building and prevent it from collapsing in on itself.

 YAL_start_building_part_3:0 "The Structure"
 YAL_start_building_part_3_desc:0 "Next, the structure of the archives will have to be made. Borean's plans are in the shape of a great tower with many floors. Many entrypoints will make it easy for griffons to fly directly to the right floor, showing both the grandeur and openness of the scientific pursuit. This will be the brute-force part of the construction. To work!"
 YAL_start_building_part_4:0 "The Interior"
 YAL_start_building_part_4_desc:0 "Inside the Archives, the walls will be finished with marble, with sturdy bookshelves carved into the stone. These will house all the knowledge of Griffonia so meticulously gathered by the universities over the years. Of course, many comfortable reading rooms will be made as well, so that anygriffon can enjoy reading the works of science and literature the Archives store."
 YAL_final_touches:0 "The Decoration"
 YAL_final_touches_desc:0 "To complete the Archives, many works of art will need to be commissioned.

 YAL_imperial_edicts_desc:0 "The Golden Bull of 731 ALB gives the Emperor the privilege to enact a Reichsedikt, a direct decree bypassing the bureaucracy of the imperial court. Grover II is specifically fond of this ancient piece of legislation as it allows the Emperor to get things done and appropriate funds from the treasury without going through proper budgeting."
 YAL_building_up_estates:0 "The Edict of Cloudbury" 
 YAL_building_up_estates_desc:0 "The North of Griffonian has been largely swept clean of the indigenous nobility by the Republicans. One is of noble blood if their ancestors proved themselves in war, and we now have many griffons who fought bravely against the peasant rabble of Cloudbury. They deserve the defunct titles of Northern Griffonia, along with estates to sustain them."
 YAL_restore_griffonstone:0 "The Edict of Griffonstone"
 YAL_restore_griffonstone_desc:0 "Once Griffonstone was a fine city, a gleaming beacon of Guto's glorious family – a centre of industry. Now look at it. I would like this city be build up again. I would like to see temples and spires of gleaming white. I would like to see our army on parade routes, not fighting in ruins. I would like to see every quarter, ever street in this miserable pile of homes turned to the service and industry of the Empire, in Boreas' name. But to see my dream fulfilled, we must first wipe the city clean of squalor and dirt and construct a new Griffonstone."
 YAL_connect_central_lands:0 "The Edict of Verenia"
 YAL_connect_central_lands_desc:0 "The sky is our natural highway, but a griffon on his own cannot transport the goods and supplies necessary for a military campaign or successful trade. Thus, we have always relied on roads. I am told my great-grandson was a great believer in the railways, even. The lands of Central Griffonia have been quite underdeveloped, even though they are the crossroads between vital parts of the Empire. In my descendant's honour, I will have new roads and rails constructed to connect the Reich."
 YAL_restore_crops:0 "The Edict of Kivessin"

For the next 45 years of his life, he would serve with distinction, proving especially resilient during the Republican uprisings where his defensive doctrines proved the undoing of many Republican offensives. In 992, he retired from the Imperial Army with the rank of major general.

 YAL_archives_constructed:0 "The Great Archives of Yale"
 YAL_archives_constructed_desc:0 "The vision of Borean Wiedergreiff, an enormous repository for all griffon knowledge, has been completed. For years we have toiled to finish this monument to science and now the great spire stands. The construction, hundreds of metres high, adorned with marble statues of the sciences and arts and many other ornaments, is a masterpiece of architecture. Every day, laygriff and scientist alike visit the structure to learn more about our world, or to simply enjoy the sight of the building. With the Archives, we will gain an enormous scientific advantage compared to those who will not enjoy access to its contents."
 YAL_agricultural_study:0 "Agricultural Studies"
 YAL_agricultural_study_desc:0 "New tools and methods to grow food have severely reduced the griffonpower needed to sustain our people. The claws that have been freed by the advance of agricultural technology can now be put to use in the factories to propel our nation forwards."
 YAL_focused_research_project:0 "The Research Focus Program"
 YAL_focused_research_project_desc:0 "Under the Research Focus Program, our scientists will coordinate their research and thus reduce overlap and more efficiently share their findings.

This has helped out every scientist, as they now have new theories to consider and new methods to use in their own work.  There is still some work left, but we are getting closer to the boundaries of our knowledge."
 YAL_archived_knowledge8:0 "Letting the Owl Fly"
 YAL_archived_knowledge8_desc:0 "The owl has been associated with wisdom by many races, and it was considered a sign by most griffons that many owls decided to nest in the Spire. Therefore, the last phase of research has been called the Owl-Project. Every book and manuscript will be read, reviewed and placed into context, so that we will gain complete knowledge of the Archives' content."
 YAL_archived_knowledge9:0 "The Owl ascends to the Sky"
 YAL_archived_knowledge9_desc:0 "The work on the Owl-Project has been proceeding rapidly, at least for a scientific project. Many works have been categorised and reviewed, and now searching for and referencing these works takes a lot less time. Our work is almost finished."

 YAL_mikusian_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 21st of October, 964 in Yale\n\n§YFunction§!: Rector Magnificus of Yale University and Praeses of the Academic Council\n\n§YBiography§!: Born into a middle class family in the old capital of the Yale Rectorate, Mikusian lived through the turbulent times of the Republican revolution as a teenager. Although many students of the Yalish universities fought for the various sides of the revolution, the country was spared the ravaging effects of war, with the Rectorate only choosing sides at the final moments of the conflict. The revolution left an impact on young Mikusian, who heard about the destruction war could cause via radio and newspaper.\n\nLike many young Yalish griffons, Mikusian grew up with tales of the country's enigmatic founder, Borean Wiedergreiff and the young griffon devoured all of the famed polymath's treatises during the revolution. By the time he enrolled for philosophy in Yale's university, Mikusian was a firm believer in Borean's rationalist philosophy of achieving peace through scientific advancement. Living and studying in the hallowed halls of Yale only strengthened the student's believes and by his second year, he decided he wanted to be a scientist and teach for himself.\n\nAnd so he did, finishing his studies without delay and writing his dissertation on the works of his idol. “Pax Scientiam: A dream worth pursuing?” was a smash hit across the academic community, securing Mikusian a teaching position. The scientist proved to be a popular lecturer and sometimes griffons had to sit on the lecture hall's stairs if they wanted to attend his vivid explanations of history, philosophy and discussions on the future of Griffonia. A final twist came in 1001, with the elections for the position of Rector. Urged by his students to stand, Mikusian won in a landslide, becoming the youngest Rector of Yale since Borean Wiedergreiff himself.\n\nNow the head of state and government of Yale, Mikusian has overseen the slow decay of the Rectorate alongside the rest of the Griffionian Empire. But the griffon has never stopped dreaming of a different future.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
 YAL_prelate_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 15th of June, 961 in Crona Province\n\n§YFunction§!: Prelate of Yale and Member of the Academic Council\n\n§YBiography§!: Michael Eisenklau was born near the Imperial city of Crona as the seventh chick in a family of peasants. The family barely scraped by and things spiralled out of control after a failed harvest in 978 spiralled Michael's village into poverty. After it was clear the local authorities refused to help, the peasants, including Michael's parents and older siblings decided to go and take their due from Crona itself. Unbeknownst to them, they were part of a massive movement which would soon fracture the Griffonian continent. Michael would never see any of them again.\n\nLeft alone to care for his younger siblings, the peasant's son turned to the only place he knew could help; the Temple. There the young griffon, weaker in body than his sturdy older brothers, managed to impress the Arcturian priest by challenging him to a duel for a chance at earning a wage. Michael lost that duel but earned himself a job, to which he tenaciously devoted himself. As the fighting raged around the Empire, sometimes coming precariously close, Michael learned the values of the different aspects of Arcturius. A Smith who can burn away impure elements through war and forge together what is fractured. A Warrior loyal, honourable and unflinching in conflict. And a leader willing to sacrifice himself to a greater cause.\n\nMichael had taken these lessons to heart long before he had completed his formal education and as the Empire licked its wounds after the revolution, he began his career in the Hierarchy of Arcturius. First as a priest to one of the many towns in the Herzland who had lost their religious leader in the fighting. Later on, as a clerk for Archon Proteus III, where he got a great deal of respect for the Warrior-Priest. Although Proteus sometimes joked about the griffon's ‘puny stature', the Archon was never mean to the former peasant. And when the position of Prelate of Yale opened up in 1005, Proteus nominated Michael himself, hoping that the commoner might be able to help heal the divides in Yalish society. Prelate Michael set to the task with great enthusiasm, reinvigorating the Triarchy in Yale with fiery speeches, charity and the help of the Sword and Shield movement, earning him a spot at the table, shifting the balance of Yalish politics in his favour.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Vasily"
 YAL_georgina_desc:0 " §YBorn§!: 12th of February, 985 in Greenback\n\n§YPosition:§!: Leader of the New Sparkle Movement\n\n§YBiography§!: The bustling city of Greenback supports a burgeoning middle class. Georgina Fredrika Schüler was born into one such family. Her father a mechanic and her mother a clerk. Georgina's parents were gentle griffons, wary of violence after the failed revolution of which she only knew from stories. Like many in Yale, the Schüler family was looking for new answers outside. They found theirs in Equestria and harmony instead of some radical movement. Georgina was raised, unlike many griffons, to see the good in everybeing, to be optimistic and to strife for change from within. The day Georgina passed the entrance test for Yale University was the proudest day of her parents' lives, as she was the first in the family to achieve this. When she set off to the other side of the country, she promised she'd not lose her heart.\n\nYale university was fascinating to Georgina, but also in a way it felt stagnant. As if it was in a different world, out of touch with reality. The teachers were fine, especially Rector Mikusian, but the curriculum felt outdated and contradicted government. For all the talk about science and philosophy, Yale's government felt like it was impeding progress and disregarding the common Yalish griffon. There was no harmony.\n\nSo, Georgina, optimistically, began to agitate for change, for a New Spark. First with a small group of friends in private. Then in Yale's university, later around all of Yale in public. The Yalish government carried on with its grand scientific visions, unbothered by the growing movement in-and-outside the universities. Democracy, a constitution and self-determination were the demands which resonated louder and louder through the streets of the Rectorate. And after a war where many griffons had to make the ultimate sacrifice, these demands could no longer be ignored.\n\nRector Mikusian called his own student to his side and asked her to lead to preserve harmony. The New Sparkle had started a fire.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup" 
 YAL_karl_legreif_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 2nd of May, 959 in Zeltstadt, Longsword\n\n§YOccupation§!: Chairgriffon of the Heartland Trade Union Federation\n\n§YBiography§!: Born to immigrants from Longsword, a region whose fortunes would decay rapidly over the course of his life, Karl Legreif had a difficult childhood. He was bullied by the Yalish children for his background, but Karl would not be walked over easily. The griffon fought his bullies at every opportunity. The bullies of other griffons too. Sometimes he'd win his battles as well.\n\nKarl turned out to be quite capable as an artisan and learned the trade of wood turner. He had just joined the Trade Union when the Republican Revolution ravaged Griffonia. For a while, it seemed the biggest bullies of all the continent would finally be defeated and Legreif enthusiastically struck at every opportunity. It was not to be, however, and the revolutionaries fled north, leaving Karl and the Yalish trade union movement disillusioned.\n\nThe years went by and the immigrant from Longsword became ever more important in the union movement. Increasingly, the working class organised and fought for their rights. This trend did not go unnoticed by the professors and students of Cyrusval University, who soon provided the theory for the Union's practice. From them, Karl learned that no wage agreement with the capitalists could ever give the workers their due and that only a shift in power could forge unity and brotherhood.\n\nThe collapse of the Griffonian Empire showed the cracks in Yalish society and increased class consciousness in the Rectorate as divisions between the learned and capitalist class and the workers became ever more clear. If threatened, like in Longsword, the ruling class would not be above allying with racist maniacs to cling on to power. Instead of turning to fascists, Rector Mikusian reached out to Cyrusval to bridge the gap between classes. But there they sensed a new age in the making. So, instead, the red university successfully allied with the Unions to bring revolution to Yale and beyond.\n\nWhen the leader of the students turned out to have gone mad, however, something had to be done. So, Karl Legreif, now leading all trade union federations in the Heartlands, took power into his own claws, determined to ensure that no being would be bullied again.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: anyazen"
 YAL_erich_muhschnabel_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 27th of November, 976 in Cyrusval\n\n§YTitle:§!: That won't be necessary, comrade.\n\n§YBiography§!: Erich Mühschnabel never had to conquer his bread. As the second son of a wealthy industrialist, Erich could have spent the rest of his life in luxury. His childhood was spent in bliss, as Erich received the best tutors money could buy. He turned out to be bright and inquisitive, and would have been a worthy successor to the family business, were it not for his older sister. Irene Mühschnabel was just a tad bit more cunning than her brother, always managing to garner her parents' favour over Erich.\n\nWhen the time came, Irene enrolled in Middenheim University, while Erich went to his own Cyrusval. The difference could not be much greater. Middenheim's grand halls taught classical economics and statecraft in a tranquil environment, a walled garden away from the hustle and bustle of the world. Cyrusval was a rowdy place of loud students, of debating clubs and radical teachers. The home of Professor Willie Scherler, an inspiring socialist who would later lead the fight for a better world in the woods of Angriver. So, as Irene studies the intricacies of profit maximalisation, Erich was taught the inherent contradictions of the capitalist mode of production.\n\nBoth siblings graduated cum laude, with Irene being allowed a prominent position in the family business, while Erich was cast out of the family as a failure. Instead of business, Erich would get a teaching position in social science, where he contributed to the ever-radicalising faculty. A sense of urgency and an air of change filled the red halls of Cyrusval as the Empire faltered and to everygriffon's surprise, the students and teachers elected Mühschnabel, the most radical candidate, as rector in the 1007 elections. When the crisis in Griffenheim escalated, Erich managed to convince national government that he would be able to mend the rifts in Yalish society. Instead, he would use the new power to prepare for a revolution.\n\nThe Mühschnabel estate was one of the first buildings to be set aflame in the ensuing violence.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: anyazen"

At the age of 18, he joined the prestigious Griffenheim Imperial Military Academy, completing an education as an engineer. For the next 45 years of his life, he would serve with distinction, proving especially resilient during the Republican uprisings where his defensive doctrines proved the undoing of many Republican offensives. In 992, he retired from the Imperial Army with the rank of major general. Since then, he has joined Löwburg Academy as a professor, being an adamant proponent of the importance of defensive doctrine within modern warfare."
 YAL_heinz_featherhoff_desc:0 "Heinz Featherhoff was born in 941 in the town of Asselt in Greifenmarschen. Born to a local merchant of the petite bourgeois class, Featherhoff's father managed to secure his son a post to Löwburg Academy at the age of 18, where he studied as an infantry officer before joining the Imperial Army. During his 30 years of service, Featherhoff fought in the Republican Uprising, gaining the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. After his tenure in the army, he rejoined his alma mater as a professor. Recently, he has shown an affinity towards the radical Red Guard, and is seen as the only senior staff who openly supports their views."
 YAL_grover_desc:0 "Grover II was the second ruler of the Griffonian Empire, ascending the throne in 785 ALB. By the time of his ascension Grover II was already an accomplished general and he commanded many of his father's forces when he unified the griffon states. The start of his reign was characterised by an Aquileian insurrection, which the Emperor's armies crushed before rebellion could spread throughout the empire. It is said that in his anger, Grover II killed the Discret King of Aquileia himself and ordered Aquila burned. To keep the Discrets from seeking revenge, he married Giselda Discret.\n\nThe Emperor decided to entrust the Idol of Boreas, the Empire's most sacred relic, to his Brother Guto, who he made King of Griffonstone, starting a period of early stability. In 799 the Emperor started his conquest south, adding Sicameon and Asterion to the Empire. Grover II was still not content with his domain, fearing his eastern frontier with the ponies of the Riverlands. Therefore he sanctioned the Knights of Hellquill to crusade against them. Internal squabbles and economic woes would delay any large scale efforts to attack the riverponies for 40 years. It is widely believed that Grover III and Giselda were the ones constantly fixing the bad domestic policies of their father and husband.\n\nIn 852 the ageing Emperor decided to finally press forward. He flew east at the head of a massive host of knights and soldiers, eager to finish his conquest of the Griffonian continent. Battle after battle was fought and Grover himself was almost invincible in his enchanted armour, the terror of his foes. That was, until the Nimbusians rallied to save what was left of River City. The Strategos of the pegasi force had lured the griffons into a chokepoint. There, the unthinkable happened. The towering griffon was in the thick of the battle, leading his most faithful knights to punch a hole in the unflinching Nimbusian battleline, when a startled young hoplite threw his spear at him instead of staying in formation. Grover was hit through the eyes and died instantly, which routed his forces.\n\nAnd now, he has returned to Griffonia to finish what he started."

 YAL_Peter_Zuckergreif_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 21th of December, 978 in Greenback\n\n§YRank§!: Generaloberst in Training\n\n§YBiography§!: Peter Zuckergreif, born in 978 in the capital city of Greenback, had always a love of cars, and wished to have one for himself. Sadly for him he was born in a rather poor family, so the best he could do was make believe with his friend. Everything changed, however, when he saw a sight which would stay with him for the rest of his life: a Panzer. From that day on, his one goal was to one day drive one of these beast, so he begged his parents to be send to Klaumar, a Military Academy who was famous for having 'strange' method of warfare in their lectures.\n\nWith hard work, much studying and some financial help from a professor at Klaumar, Peter managed to become a student in 999, and quickly showed his teachers what knowledge he had. Even in his first year he managed to come up with impressive theories on how to deploy tanks, developing the many roles of armoured vehicles in warfare. Sadly for him, driving a tank was not possible for an officer, so Peter focused on revolutionizing the usage of tanks in the Imperial Army. In his last year at Klaumar in 1003 he met his pupil Apfel von Kuchen, which ended in a close friendship between the two, although a few griffons insist that there was more to it than they would let on.\n\nAfter Zuckergreif graduated, he enlisted directly into the Yalish Army, and too his surprise he became a staff officer of the major general Gerhard Silverbeak, who, while technically retired, was still in command of Yale's field army. Gerhard took it into his claws to train Peter to become his successor, and while they both have very different ideas of how modern warfare will look, resulting in hour-long debates, Silverbeak still decided to train Zuckergreif. The old Generalmajor even got Apfel von Kuchen a command position."
 YAL_Sabine_Bucher_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 1st of February, 945 in Appenage\n\n§YRank§!: Generalleutnant\n\n§YBiography§!: The live of Sabine Bucher as a young chick was a hard one, with her family being poor farmers in the region of Appengen. She watched most of her siblings die, either because of sickness or in one case, of starvation. At the young age of 14 she left her home quietly and went on a journey to the Imperial Crownlands, where she enlisted into the army under a false identity. After her training was done she was sent to Yale for training and she would end up studying in the Academy of Löwburg thanks to a recommendation from her superior. Sabine's great memory served her well, but the training was hard for the peasant griffon. In the end she graduated, but just barely, in 963.\n\nDuring the next 10 years, she quietly rose up the ladder in the Imperial Army. But then, as a shock for everygriff, the Republican Revolution broke out. While she herself could understand the struggle of the griffons, she could not betray her newfound friends, and so she whipped the Yalish military, which was on the verge of mutiny, back into shape, commanding many more troops then intended. The Rectorate in Yale rewarded her valorous action with nothing, wishing to remain neutral in the conflict. In spite of orders, Sabine still led her forces over the Yalish border to fight the Republicans, inspire nationalist fervour in Yale.\n\nWhen the Empire was re-established and the republicans driven out, the Rectors finally acknowledged Bucher. For her bravery she was recommended to be promoted to Generalfeldmarshall, but she declined, insisting she only did her duty. Sabine would spent the rest of her years in Yale, where she has become a famous Griffon for her action in the war and her humble refusal of a promotion."
 YAL_Apfel_von_Kuchen_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 12th of March, 981 in Yale\n\n§YRank§!: Fähnrich\n\n§YBiography§!: Apfel von Kuchen is a young lesser noble chick from the city of Yale, in accordance with her parents' wishes, enlisted in the University of Middenheim in 1001 to study economics. It did not take long for her to realise that this study was not for her and she decided on a radically different path. After convincing one of her professors to lie to her parents about her status, she enrolled in the Klaumar Academy in 1003, and quickly became a star student of the institution, stealing some fame from her senior on the Academy and prodigy himself, Peter Zuckergreif.\n\nDuring her time in Klaumar it became clear to her that she wanted to stay with the Yalish Army. Eventually she made friends with her senior and Academy rival Peter Zuckergreif, although the two still don't agree on the methods of warfare. After Peter graduated and left Klaumar there were few students who could keep up with Apfel.\n\nIn 1005, while being still a student at Klaumar, she got invited into the Imperial Army, to join as an Fähnrich, and while she has technically not finished her schooling yet a chronic shortage of staff officers and a few good words from Peter, got Von Kuchen her position. Thus, with her parents still in the dark about her choices in life, the newly minted officer knew her future."
 YAL_Melinda_Rotkreuz_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 30th of April, 980 in Asselt\n\n§YRank§!: Übersicht-Kamerad\n\n§YBiography§!: Even at a young age Melinda Rotkreuz struggled with day to day life, as she suffered anger management problems. Countless times she started fights with her teachers, who only put up with her antics because of her surprising calculated intellect and her merchant parents providing financial incentives.\n\nHoping that Yale's famous Universities would tame Melinda's anger somewhat, her parents sent her to study at Cyrusval on her 18th Birthday, oblivious to the university's radical professors. There, under the influence of Professors like Erich Mühschnabel, she began to direct her hatred on the capitalist system, even going so far as to despise her parents for abusing their wealth to buy Melinda favours. She was one of the first Griffons to join Erich in his plan for revolution, and she helped planning and even acquired weapons. Surprisingly, during the many battles over Yale, like the siege of Gamia and Bruma, she showed her talents of leadership, leading her comrades into battle and pushing them on with her rage.\n\nAs the flames consumed the symbols of the old order and the red and black banners of revolution fluttered high all over Yale, Melinda was still not satisfied. Even though the military hierarchy had no place in the future of Yale, there was still a need for those who could lead the griffons into battle. Heinz Featherhoff, now in charge of the defence of the Communes, invented a new role:  Übersicht-Kamerad. And the first Übersicht-Kamerad to be named was no one else then Melinda Rotkreuz, who took on the position with honour."

Prelate Michael has done well guiding us up to this point, but the time has come for Archon Proteus to assume leadership. The warrior-priest is exactly the griffon we need to take the reins of the Empire while we set about regaining its lost glory.\n\nHe has a tough task ahead of him, as many throughout Herzland have abandoned the Gods during this period of hardship and will refuse the embrace the light unless forced to. It will take resolve to face down these wayward souls, but Proteus was never one to shy away from a challenge. As our divinely blessed leader he shall also be a moral exemplar, so that we may restore the virtues that too many modern griffons have forgotten. We know Proteus is capable of this, and there is no doubt that he will shepard the Empire into a new age of honour and prosperity."

 yale.89.d:0 "On a bright day in Griffenheim, thousands of soldiers from the Imperial Army gathered to hear an address from Archon Proteus. Many Arcturian priests were scattered throughout the mass of griffons, serving as either warpriests or military advisors. The Archon stood ready to address them in front of a towering Arcturan temple which was one of the oldest structures in the entire city. After taking a brief moment to survey the crowd, Proteus cleared his throat.\n\n"It is with much pride that I come before you today. I have been fortunate enough to witness a transformation of this great land, from a collection of squabbling fiefdoms into a strong and virtuous Empire. By heeding the word of the Gods, we have put ourselves on a holy path of redemption." Proteus spread his arms wide, smiling up to the sky as cheers filled the air. "But we must not be satisfied with what we have accomplished thus far." Proteus frowned, holding up a claw. The soldiers went completely silent, captivated by the Archon.\n\n"Although we now honour the Gods, there are far too many griffons who mock them and reject their guidance. There are far too many griffons who live in darkness, and who have yet to be shown the true way." Proteus' tone steadily grew louder and more intense. "I tell you it is our sacred duty to save them all!" Proteus' claw clenched into a fist. "The righteous sword of Arcturius will cut down all the impious armies of Griffonia, until we all are united under the banner of the Gods!" At this proclamation, the soldiers erupted into thunderous applause. "

Grover's procession progressed slowly through the city, and morning turned to afternoon by the time they reached the Imperial Palace. The soon-to-be Emperor climbed the palace steps to deafening cheers while Archon Proteus stood awaiting him at the top.\n\nWhen Grover came beak to beak with Proteus, the old Archon smiled warmly, pride swelling in his eyes. The griffon who had done so much to salvage the Empire and restore the favour of the Gods was finally passing on the torch. Grover bowed deeply, and Proteus lowered the crown onto his head. When Grover's head rose, the ceremony was complete.\n\nAfter calling for quiet, the new Emperor said a few words to the enraptured crowd. "It is a great honour to wear this crown. I look forward to humbly serving both the Empire's citizens and the Gods, whom I pray will continue to bring prosperity to the Empire.

 yale.99.t:0 "Hints of Madness"
 yale.99.d:0 "The Union office in Greenback was a mess. There had been fighting inside the building during the Revolution, as some overeager policegriffons attempted to raid the building once they caught wind of what was about to happen. The bodies had been removed, but there was still lots of cleaning to be done before the Union Headquarters would be fully operational again. The sorry state of his office did not stop Karl Legreif from working, however. Many griffons were now looking to him for guidance, still not quite used to the idea that they were in charge of their own affairs in this new system.\n\nIncessant knocking on his office door caught Karl's attention. He raised his gruffy voice, “Come in.” A young griffon woman, barely an adult by the looks of it, had a look on her face as if she had just seen Maar himself, the god of death. Karl gestured her to come closer, “Good afternoon, comrade. How can I help?” He said, his voice turning warm. “Sit down and tell me what is on your mind.”\n\nThe griffon did just that and soon had gathered the courage to speak. “I travelled all the way here from Cyrusval, mister Legreif. . . My dad said you could be trusted!”\n\n“I will do my best, comrade?”\n\n“Oh, I am Iris. I work. . . Worked, as a maid for the Mühschnabel family.” She took a deep breath. “So after the revolution, I went to check up on the estate, to see if anygriff or anything was still left there. But the whole place was burned down. There was one griffon there though.” She looked down a bit, shaking as she said it. “It was Erich, Theodore Mühschnabel's son and the rector.”\n\nKarl reached out and held the claw of the maid. “It is a tragedy, both you and him must have lost those who you were close to. He made a great sacrifice for us-”\n\nIris interrupted, her voice flaring up. “No! He wasn't mourning mister Legreif, he was cackling like a maniac. He was talking to himself about revenge and how he would show old Theodore. How he would outdo his sister. He seemed to switch back and forth between that and calling you and the unions traitors.”\n\nKarl took a deep breath, still holding the girl's claw, staring at her deeply.

 yale.100.d:0 "It didn't take long for Karl to track down several griffons who could help him understand what had been going on with his supposed ally in revolution. Erich Mühscnabel had everything, the brains, the wealth and the education to make it. But he also had a sister, who was slightly better at everything she did. Iris and other griffons who worked for the family all sketched a similar story of the Rector's upbringing. He was humiliated by his father, who didn't see Erich as good enough for his obscenely high standards. Had he been born in any other family, Erich would have been considered a bright star, but for Theodore Mühschnabel, his son merely reached second place.\n\nA retired policegriffon recalled Erich being caught trying to set fire to a police station and a gardener confirmed that the older he became, the more Erich seemed to speak to himself. The problem only compounded when he entered university and the emotions he felt were channelled into ideology. It rationalised his fears and anger and gave him a power fantasy. One of his students remarked that Erich once shocked the lecture hall by ranting about how he would enjoy watching the fires of justice burn the capitalists.\n\nHardest to track down were the ones who did the deed. Karl finally got one of the personal students of Mühschnabel in his office. They were first year students. The conversation was intense and taxed both Karl and the young one. He described how the Rector had given them guns and firebombs and led them to his Estate. It did not take much effort to force the gates. The scenes which happened inside were cruel to the utmost and once he got going, the student described them in heart wrenching detail. The entire Mühschnabel family was hiding inside, from elderly to child and were submitted to Erich's power fantasy the entire, before he burned his Estate. The Rector had the students swear to never share the story.\n\nThe Evidence was clear. Erich had a tragic past, but his action proved that he could not be trusted to lead in any capacity. Something had to be done."

The palace acts as a hospital for now to treat the many wounded from the battle for Griffenheim. However, with the Emperor in our custody we are faced with a unbearably painful choice: Do we snuff out monarchism once and for all, or not?\n\nGrover is just a child. He did not commit any of the atrocities committed in his name and he is not responsible for choosing his parents. By all accounts he is a bright young griff, who does not at all have to turn into an oppressive monster. We cannot hold him responsible for any of the actions he did, so it would be most reasonable to just let him go. Have him be raised by normal griffons in a normal town where he will just be a normal comrade like everygriffon else.\n\nHowever, symbols are powerful. A living symbol even more so. If somegriffon were to find out that the Emperor is still alive, they might, in pursuit of some romanticised past, launch a rebellion. Statistically speaking, there is a chance that one life could save many. It is impossible to predict just how much of his imperial legacy is stuck with Grover currently. If he is anything like his ancestors he will be gifted and bright and could work against the revolution as an adult. We cannot be sure unless we take action now."

Present was the entire Outward Coordination Council too, as well as Rector Erich and Karl Legreif. The former was basking in the glory of his victory, getting cheap rounds of applause from his speeches. The latter had not spoken for the entire event, preferring to watch as the Rector grew ever more into his role. He had most of the crowd hanging from his beak and the way he could present the difficult theories of anarchism clearly was certainly appealing. It was easy to forget what kind of griffon he was dealing with.\n\nHowever, it was not quite enough for Karl Legreif. The small Rector in front of him was a sadistic troubled monster and he could snap at any moment. That was the truth Mühschnabel was hiding so masterfully in his lecture to the Congress. But Karl had come prepared. He had loyal armed comrades lying in wait outside and inside the theatre, he had secured positions within the senior leadership. And most importantly of all, he had the evidence, written declarations and documents, of Erich's many cruel acts. The trap was set, but would he spring it?\n\nListening to Erich speak was so easy, his words were so convenient. When he spoke of his ideology, he carried the audience away and painted a picture in their minds. Karl himself had no aspirations of leadership, he simply wanted what was best and the longer he listened, the more he wanted to keep the illusion alive. The more he wanted to follow. The burden of his decision started to weigh on him more and more. He froze in place, and it was if time grinded to a halt around him. It would be so simple to just let the moment pass.

Working in smaller groups and voting on proposals which would be brought before the entire plenum, the delegates of the proletariat voted on the affairs which concerned all the communes, like defence and justice for their conquered opponents. Overall, the spirit of libertarian socialism was strong and there was much optimism for the future.\n\nThe congress was overwhelmed by the presence of one griffon, Erich Mühschnabel. Every time they would bicker amongst themselves, the Cyrusval Rector intervened. His speeches were inspiring and helped every delegate understand their place in the world. On the final day, he proposed to the plenum to have the liberation of Griffonia as their new goal. After his speech had already swept up the delegates, the congress voted overwhelmingly to pass the warlike resolution without further deliberation. Now, there was only one motion left by a delegate from the city of Yale.\n\nThe male griffon, a former shopkeeper it turned out, began his defence of the motion. He recalled that it was Rector Mühschnabel who managed to finally put Cyrusval University firmly on the path to revolution. That it was the Rector who prepared the soldiers, the students and the workers for the uprising. And that later it was Erich who organised the defences against the rest of the imperialist rulers of the Heartlands. Then he complimented the Rector on his shining example today, where he managed to steer and lead discussions into the right tracks and imbued the congress with the spirit of revolution. There were shouts of agreement from the theatre benches as the griffon finished his argument. “And to recognise his efforts and in due consideration, this congress will give Erich Mühschnabel the title of Father of the Revolution.”\n\nThere was no need for a formal vote, as the yells and cheers of support from the overwhelming majority of delegates made it clear the motion was going to pass, although it was unclear what exactly this meant, or whether this was even something the congress could decide. Even an anarchist society needs its figureheads, it would seem."

When the Rector finally entered, he was welcomed with thundering applause, which subsided once he asked for silence. The griffon adjusted his glasses, and smirked confidently towards the audience.\n\n“Dear delegates of the Congress, comrades, I am here today to speak on behalf of a proposal. In it, I recommend an aggressive course of actions for our Communes, where we strike the statists in unison before they can attack us. We cannot be truly free while slavery persists on Griffonia. We cannot sit idly by while oppressive regimes throw thousands to their deaths in pointless wars while they profit in their ivory towers!”\n\nThe Rector's voice trailed off and for a moment he seemed to be dreaming. Erich saw a battlefield, trenches on a landscape scarred by wars. Bodies. Suffering. Shell impacts. Tanks. Aircraft. A single gunshot rang in his ears and he was transported back to the theatre, where all was still silent. Erich hoped it was only a couple of seconds this time as he spoke again, a bit more softly than before.\n\n“So, I propose we do something about those statist imperialists beyond our borders. Those misguided republicans and fat monarchs! We will liberate the old city of Griffonstone, the slums of Aquila and the villas of Karthin! In every heart we will ignite the fires of revolution. We go to war, but we fight for the liberation of all Griffonia! We must go to war, comrades. Therefore I commend this motion to the Plenum!”\n\nThere was loud applause, it seemed that the delegates had gotten swept up again, standing or jumping up and raising their fists up int the air.

Those unlucky enough to be chosen spent the next few hours repelling down and climbing up the cliffside with the cargo, using the measurements from the teams above to place the devices in precisely the correct place for maximum effect.\n\nIt was almost dawn when the preparations were complete. The engineers had considered the impact of their actions, but warning those likely to be affected by what was about to happen would create unacceptable delays. The engineers set their timers, ensuring the mechanical elements were all placed correctly. One of them muttered a prayer and was glared at by the others. Then the engineers flew away. That day the sunrise would be accompanied by a thunderous noise and many griffons would never be seen again.\n\nThe cause of the explosion was completely unclear, with rumours ranging from statist terrorists to an act of Boreas himself.

He was staring at the ceiling, alone with his thoughts, for all his scheming and power never got him anyone he could trust. No griffon he could confide his visions to. They had appeared more often since the one in the theatre, flashes of the reality he had created, a mixture of memory and his imagination blending together to torture his mind. His family home, the smell of burnt wood, of smouldering ashes. Revenge.\n\nErich stood up, walking to his desk without him consciously commanding his body. He didn't feel like sleeping anyway. He stared towards the wall in front of his desk. But, instead of the wallpaper someone was staring back. Erich's sister. “Irene. . .” Erich mumbled, half asleep, weak and sweaty.\n\nIrene stared back, being joined by the rest of his family to either side, his nephews and nieces, his grandparents, missing only his father. The Rector quickly turned around to escape the stare of his sister, only to find his father waiting for him, his broad stature blocking the way.\n\n“No. . . no! I got rid of you. Why are you here?!” Erich screamed, shaking anxiously. He reached back towards his desk, opening the drawer and reaching for his gun.\n\n“Now, now, Erich, you know what you did. Shooting me won't change that.” Theodore Mühschnabel said in his usual, condescending tone. Erich panicked further, aiming the gun at his father, his aim unsteady.\n\n“Stop, I am so close dad. So close!”\n\n“You? Betrayed their trust, accomplished nothing.” Theodore's laughter echoed through the room, turning into screeches. Erich faltered and collapsed to the ground, crying. He was surrounded by faceless shadows of griffons. Those he had condemned to an early death. Their whispers were so loud as to rupture his ears, even though he could not understand a word.\n\n“Make it stop! Please, make it stop!” Erich whined, grasping his gun closer.\n\nAn ear-deafening gunshot brought him back to reality. The room was silent and Erich was alone. Silence at last, everything would be well now. Erich clutched his head. A splitting headache started to drown out all the bad thoughts. The griffon closed his eyes."

 yale.111.d:0 "Yale's courthouse was packed, as the jury for this grand trial consisted of a thousand delegates from all over Griffonia. On trial were the Black Council and the Red Claw Chamber, the two organisations supervised by the late Rector. His dead had sent shockwaves through the Communes, the father of the revolution passing away so soon. Karl Legreif took up his unofficial role in leading the two security organisations, and quickly discovered that both were filled with Gamia scientists and ruthless soldiers for who ethics played no role.\n\nWith the trial, the legacy of Erich Mühschnabel was determined. In hindsight, his methods were cruel and some of his actions were morally unjustified. But in hindsight, he did lead a righteous revolution which had left most of Griffonia better off. The defence lawyer had the jury reflect, that sometimes evil griffons were necessary to accomplish good things. No griffon else could have swept up the populace to dare and take a risk like the revolution. No griffon else would take their ambitions further. He did take horrible measures to win, partly because the cost of losing would be so great. Karl had to admit that he would never have followed through with the liberation of so many griffons. If they looked back on this event in the future, what would the historians weigh heavier? For the next generation raised in freedom, lifted out of poverty? They would surely condemn the insanity, the acts of personal cruelty. There might be others who would praise his courage.\n\nThe prosecution spoke as well, highlighting the cruel acts the father of the revolution had committed and which others committed under his protection. Unforgivable. The sadistic weapon devices devised by the red claw, the questionable recruitment methods of the Black Council.\n\nIn the end, the jury judged the Black Council guilty, as well as Mühschnabel, posthumously. The fact that he got a fair trial at all made Karl optimistic for the future. It seemed that by chance or design, Mühschnabel used the rotten means at his disposal only at the edges of society, leaving the core of socialism intact. The communes can go on."

 yale.116.d:0 " “Executive Summary to the Chairgriffon of the H-TUF\n\nThe committees have done their work gathering testimonies from fighters and civilians of all sides. Thousands of interviews have been taken and archivists, wherever available have been contacted to restore the archives of the governments which came before, including the National Archives of Yale, Griffenheim, De Vleugels and others. With this information in hand, the committees proceeded to hold local meetings to bring together those who fought and those who suffered.\n\nMany griffons had a lot of emotional difficulty with being brought face to face with those who they fought against or those committed crimes against them. Tough conversations were had and tears flowed readily. We helped those present to understand their struggle in the context of the wider class struggle and that violent coercion was often at play. A lot of the time, some form of closure could be reached between the different parties but whenever this was not the case we did proceed to try those who committed the worst offences.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of crimes have been recorded and closed off now and it is the hope of the truthfinders that we helped close the wounds caused by warfare. Attached you will find a list of cases and how they were handled.\n\nSincerely,\nThe head of the Truthfinding Committees.”"

 yale.117.t:0 "The Chairgriffon's Final Speech"
 yale.117.d:0 "A truly enormous crowd had gathered on the square in front of the old Imperial Palace in Griffenheim, some parts of which were now used as a gathering place, although the most monumental areas were kept in their original state for posterity's sake. The crowd was there to watch Karl Legreif, the head of the Herzland Trade Union Federation speak. His leadership during the struggles of the past and his implementation of socialism across the Heartlands has made him a sort of mythical personality for many workers.\n\nWhen Karl Legreif appeared on the podium, however, it was just one griffon in an old suit with a microphone. He smiled a bit solemnly at the crowd and then started to speak. “I am glad you all came down to see me. It's humbling to think how much some of you support me. But that is exactly why I am making this speech.” The union boss took a deep breath. “I am retiring, and there will not be a successor to my position.”\n\nThe crowd was shocked, some shouted protests against the move, others demanded to know who was forcing him to stand down. Legreif made a calming claw-gesture and explained, “I have done my part to secure our revolution and put in place the institutions to protect it from capitalists outside and power-hungry griffons inside. But I am myself the final hurdle to be overcome. I realise that as long as you all put my trust in me, you will never truly dare to rule yourself.”\n\nThe woodworker from Longsword gave the crowd another smile. “I have faith in you. You can move on without me, you will do great. Don't let anygriffon take the power you have away from you, comrades. Thank you.” The figure put down the microphone and the stunned crowd started to applaud, first cautiously but then with more conviction as Karl Legreif departed the stage for good."

However, our advancements have garnered little recognition outside of our borders.\nTo address this, the Rectorate has asked that we finance a Yale Exposition which would allow the universities, scientists, and firms of our great nation to come together and promote their work. While the project would not be cheap, if approved, it'd do wonders in promoting our image.\n"

This technology would allow for meal to be cooked in a matter of minutes.\nA zoology expo sponsored by Gamia, which showed all manner of exotic life from all across the Griffonian continent and beyond.\nAnd finally, there was the work of Greenback's Academy of Medicine which showed off their cutting-edge pharmacology work and how it is helping to bring forth the magical potential of the griffon population.\nWhile today was exciting, the next two weeks of events promise our guests a whole slew of fascinating discovers and investment opportunities."

 yale.98.t:0 "The Transition"
 yale.98.d:0 "For close to twenty years, Cyrusval University's faculty of sociology has worked in tandem with Greenback Medical Academy's department of psychiatry, exploring the field of gender dysphoria. In theory, a small segment of the population has this condition which creates a state where the person's perceived gender does not align with their physical characteristics.\nWhile research into this field has been met by much criticism from the Prelate and even members of both universities' faculty, who claim it to be a field of pseudoscience. Still, the researchers attached to the project have pressed on, developing many medical and therapeutic techniques to help address the issue.\nThe cumulation of their research has resulted in the theorizing of a surgery which can use the material of a male griffon's genitals to a fateful replication of the feminine version. Today marks the first successful surgery using this technique, pioneered by Georges Beakruo, which successfully changed the genitals of Lile Eaglefeather.\nThis move has been met by much condemnation, but the researchers, doctors, and attached staff have all vowed to continue this field of research."

 ###INDUSTRY###
 YAL_subsidize_industry:0 "Subsidise Industry"
 YAL_subsidize_industry_desc:0 "Although some of our more radical economists despise any government interference into the economy, analyses have shown that there is much to gain from subsidising our industries. A few key investments will give us the opportunity to innovate new production methods that will give our factories an advantage over foreign competitors."

 YAL_yale_factories:0 "Revitalise Yale"
 YAL_yale_factories_desc:0 "Yale, the old capital and namesake of our country has slowly but surely been eclipsed by Greenback as the heart of [YAL.GetNameDef]. However, the city lays at a strategic location for trade within the region and still has room to grow its industry. An investment in Yale now could see the city regain some of its former splendour."

 YAL_greenback_factories:0 "Invest in the Capital"
 YAL_greenback_factories_desc:0 "Greenback has been the throbbing heart of [YAL.GetNameDef] since the industrial revolution kicked off. Many of the old cities in Griffonia grew decadent and new centres of industry and culture took their place. With the city already being the home of our most important companies, we ought to incentivise them to expand their production in the city."

 YAL_develop_yale_ironworks:0 "Ironworks in Yale"
 YAL_develop_yale_ironworks_desc:0 "Yale’s industry is experiencing a healthy growth now and those new factories are creating their own demands. Steel is the key to keep our heavy industry working and it would be prudent to create ironworks on site. A steady supply of iron is sure to make the city even more industrious."

 YAL_tungsten_production:0 "Open the Tungsten Mine"
 YAL_tungsten_production_desc:0 "Tungsten is usually mined in small underground extraction sites. However, an open tungsten mine would mean a way higher yield of this strategically important material, seeing as shells made from this material are essential for modern artillery pieces. Sure, this won’t be pretty to look at, but the locals will surely be swayed by more jobs. "

 YAL_develop_greenback_ironworks:0 "Greenback Steel"
 YAL_develop_greenback_ironworks_desc:0 "Weapons, cars and many other goods are made from steel. We are lucky enough to have enough mines within our borders to supply us with the necessary ores. However, our steel output can be raised even higher by funding another steel mill in the capital."

 YAL_aluminium_production:0 "Secure Aluminium Production"
 YAL_aluminium_production_desc:0 "Although steel keeps heavy industry turning, aluminium is needed for some high-tech goods like planes. By investing in aluminium production alongside our steel production, our industry will be ready for the demands of the future."

 YAL_yale_infrastructure:0 "Highways to Yale"
 YAL_yale_infrastructure_desc:0 "Yale’s infrastructure has been neglected for years, since the area lacked the heavy industrial traffic of Greenback. It is imperative that Yale gets properly integrated into our transportation network, so that the southwest will also be open for future industrial development."

 YAL_frontline_infrastructure:0 "Rails to the North"
 YAL_frontline_infrastructure_desc:0 "Most of the trade to Griffenheim has happened via river, which meant the cities in the north of the country missed out on vital investments into highways and railroads. With the Empire growing ever more volatile, it may be strategic and not economic interests that get us to finally properly connect the north to the capital."

 YAL_greenback_infrastructure:0 "Station One"
 YAL_greenback_infrastructure_desc:0 "Our rail network has been planned from Greenback since the first rails were laid down. The station building, a masterpiece of late-imperial architecture in the capital, aptly called Station One by those griffons who work on the railways is the hub for goods and passenger transport. It is time to double down and expand Station One with new platforms and warehouses."

 ###Society### 
 YAL_educational_effort:0 "Modernise the Curriculum"
 YAL_educational_effort_desc:0 "The speed at which science advances is growing ever faster, leaving griffons in more unfortunate countries behind. However, the universities must keep a steady flow of students coming from the younger generations. To give them the highest chance to succeed in higher education, we must update the curriculum so that the pupils aren’t taught outdated knowledges and refuted theories."

 YAL_bank_reform:0 "Revise the Banking Law"
 YAL_bank_reform_desc:0 "Banking is a time-honoured tradition in all of the Herzland, but the laws that govern these bankers are opaque by design. We will have our most senior law professors write a new Banking Law, one that favours our country over these transnationally operating bankers. Even laissez-faire economists agree that the law should guard against perverse incentives as to make the economy shock-resistant."

 YAL_public_schools:0 "Refurbish the Public Schools"
 YAL_public_schools_desc:0 "With most of the education budget going to universities, our public schools have been chronically underfunded. They require everything, new classrooms, textbooks and even functioning heating so that our young ones don’t have to sit in class with two winter coats on. We shall provide for our future talent!"

 YAL_land_reform:0 "Land Consolidation"
 YAL_land_reform_desc:0 "The age of feudalism has left its mark on our country as it has on most of Griffonia. Marriages, ancient contracts and feuds have made the countryside a confusing patchwork of farms and fields owned by small farmers and big estates. By encouraging land consolidation, where farmers trade their lands to make more efficient and larger fields, our agriculture will flourish."

 YAL_agricultural_studies:0 "The Science of Agriculture"
 YAL_agricultural_studies_desc:0 "Agricultural Studies is not the most prestigious field of science, but the field is rapidly developing. Rational management theories and advances in biology and organic chemistry, along with mechanised tools are paramount to increase food production. Let us remember that food surplus has been the engine of growth for civilisations since the dawn of time."

 YAL_universal_education:0 "Universal Education"
 YAL_universal_education_desc:0 "Not every griffon in our country has the intrinsic motivation that draws so many of our people to the pursuit of knowledge. In fact, a lot of griffons in the countryside refuse to send their chicks to school, preferring that they work on the land. Mandatory education is a necessary change, which will make sure that every talented griffon makes its way into the hallowed halls of our university!"

 YAL_gold_standard:0 "Embrace the Gold Standard"
 YAL_gold_standard_desc:0 "When the Empire ruled Griffonia, there was no doubt about the stability of its currency. Now that the ironclad faith in Griffenheim is but a footnote in the history books, we will require a new idea. By tying our currency to gold, our money will be stable, as no griffon will doubt the value of the most precious metal!"

 YAL_industrial_breakthrough:0 "Methods for a New Millennium"
 YAL_industrial_breakthrough_desc:0 "Our industry has been lagging behind academia for a while now, due to a lack of R&D investments made by our companies. If we are to move our industry to the second millennium, the state must intervene by investing in industrial modernisation. Science will make it so our factories produce more with less!"

 YAL_yale_university:0 "Expand Yale University"
 YAL_yale_university_desc:0 "Yale University is the oldest and most prestigious university in the country, but much like the city in which it stands, the institute has been overshadowed by modernity. However, its expansive library and tradition for excellence warrant another investment. We must commission an experienced architect to build a new wing for the old university, so that Yale may use it to soar to new heights!"

 YAL_focused_research:0 "The Research Focus Program"
 YAL_focused_research_desc:0 "Our laboratories, scientists and other research facilities are ready for the next step to push the boundaries of griffon knowledge. With the Research Focus Program, the government will set out a goal for a period of 200 days. In this time, all universities will focus their attention on tackling this particular area of science, as to produce immediate benefits for our people."

 YAL_the_great_yale_archives:0 "The Great Yale Archives"
 YAL_the_great_yale_archives_desc:0 "Borean Wiedergreiff was both an architectural visionary and a griffon working to preserve our knowledge. He is responsible for many of the reforms that made Yale what it is today, but he could never see his magnum opus finished. A massive archive, housing all the world’s knowledge. The construction of this elaborate building will be a great task, but a worthy project indeed for Borean’s heirs."

 YAL_send_invitations:0 "Invite Griffonia’s Finest"
 YAL_send_invitations_desc:0 "Borean Wiedergreiff envisioned that his archives would help build peace amongst the griffons of the continent, by becoming a meeting place of the scholarly elite and a beacon against the ignorance that in his view, led to warfare. With the archives complete, we must invite the best griffon scholars from every nation to study in the Yale Archives. May science lead to understanding between Boreas’s chosen."

 YAL_learn_from_the_past:0 "The Treasures of the Past"
 YAL_learn_from_the_past_desc:0 "Warfare, ignorance and malice has destroyed much of the knowledge of the ancient Griffonian Empire. The archives are helping historians and other researchers to piece together the knowledge of the past. Much of the ancients’ knowledge may be outdated, but sometimes they seem to be wiser than we could have ever imagined."

 ###Internal Politics###
 ##Fascism##
 YAL_gather_the_council:0 "Gather the Council"
 YAL_gather_the_council_desc:0 "With the situation in Griffenheim turning increasingly more volatile, we must gather the Council of Rectors to plan out a new course for [YAL.GetNameDef]. The death of the Emperor and the choice of a new regent has shattered what remained of imperial unity. Desperate times call for desperate measures, so perhaps it is time to listen to some of the country’s more radical minds."
 
 YAL_bruma_and_gamia:0 "Bruma and Gamia"
 YAL_bruma_and_gamia_desc:0 "In the west of Yale lie the two university cities of Bruma and Gamia. These universities maintain close ties with the local Prelate of Arcturius and have become a brooding place for radicalism. Gamia houses brilliant biologists who dare to push beyond the boundaries of the ethical. The Bruma social science faculty, meanwhile, rejects liberal theories about society in favour of a communal system."

 YAL_archons_patronage:0 "The Archons’ Patronage"
 YAL_archons_patronage_desc:0 "The Archons are delighted that Yale has chosen to favour the university of Bruma. To promote Bruma’s traditionalist theories in the rest of Yale, they have chosen to increase their investments into our country, increasing the church’s control of the education system in particular. With the Archons’ Patronage, our country will rise to greatness. "

 YAL_additional_funding:0 "Charitas"
 YAL_additional_funding_desc:0 "Although the role of charity in griffon society is often debated and disputed, a charm offensive by the church would smooth out tensions in Yale. Many commoners question the renewed prevalence of religion in our society, but if we can show the best side of the church, their concerns will melt like dew in the sun."

 YAL_archons_visit:0 "Plan the Archon’s Visit"
 YAL_archons_visit_desc:0 "His Holiness Archon Proteus III is the embodiment of the traditional values that will save Yale from the culture-destroying ideologies of republicanism and socialism. However, some of the people still doubt the benevolent intent of the voice of Arcturius. A visit by the Archon will remind the griffons of Yale how Arcturius would want us to live."

 YAL_social_sciences:0 "Bruma’s Social Sciences"
 YAL_social_sciences_desc:0 "The university of Bruma is an exception amongst universities. The faculty for social sciences rejects the universalist ideologies of harmony and socialism as Equestrian attempts to export their way of life. According to the professors of Bruma, if Yale is to weather the coming storm, we must return to our past and look for guidance in our own culture."

 YAL_indoctrinate_students:0 "Indoctrinate Students"
 YAL_indoctrinate_students_desc:0 "University students are interesting griffons. They have learned so little, yet they think they understand so much. The student body of Bruma already knows their place, working tirelessly to improve Yalian society. It is time to discipline these lazy, good for nothing young griffons into disciplined and self-sacrificing birds Arcturius can be proud of."

 YAL_address_population:0 "Local Ethics"
 YAL_address_population_desc:0 "Many of our academics have grown too detached from the real world and the normal people. Let us return to them and learn from the people. The answer to what a just society is cannot be found in any book from Equestrian philosophers. The answer is out there, in the street. We have but to go a-looking. "

 YAL_common_cause:0 "The Common Cause"
 YAL_common_cause_desc:0 "Now that everygriffon in our country is in agreement with the importance of incorporating our culture into government, we can work on the task at hand. More government discretion will be needed to make sure this works and several rights will have to be temporarily restricted to ensure that the process of pursuing the common cause proceeds smoothly."

 YAL_new_council_member:0 "A New Council Member"
 YAL_new_council_member_desc:0 "To ensure an easy advantage for Bruma and Gamia in the Council of Rectors, we will need another vote. We will have our allies in the church convince the people that the Council requires religious guidance. With this pressure, we will be able to push for a new member; Arcturian Prelate Micahel of the Yaledom."

 YAL_crackdown_on_dissenters:0 "Silence!"
 YAL_crackdown_on_dissenters_desc:0 "With the Prelate now being one of the most powerful griffons in the country, many voices say that is a betrayal of the ideals of our nation. We cannot have these griffons organize and bundle their strength against us. We must silence these voices the Arcturian way. Forcefully."

 YAL_offer_compromise:0 "Calm the Voices of Dissent"
 YAL_offer_compromise_desc:0 "The Prelate’s ascend to the Council has caused many concerns amongst student and professor alike. With compromises, flattery and bribes, we will be able to calm the situation down. Arcturius the smith will forge our society together through strength. It is worth the effort if every Yalian wholeheartedly supports us in the long run."
 
 YAL_challenge_griffenheim:0 "Challenge Griffenheim!"
 YAL_challenge_griffenheim_desc:0 "The foolish Griffenheim nobility have forced out the Archon of Boreas. Without him as the regent, who knows what corruption these nobles may force into the head of Grover VI. It is time to restore the church before Griffenheim unleashes disaster upon us all. Arcturius smiles upon the faithful who take up arms in his name. With the prelate’s blessing, we go to war!"

 YAL_stabilize_council:0 "Yale’s New Position"
 YAL_stabilize_council_desc:0 "Archon Eros VII has rightfully been appointed regent of the Empire, with Archon Proteus III part of the ruling council. With them leading the faithful, a new era is sure to follow. The prelate believes that we will be better off by keeping a semblance of autonomy in the greater Griffonian Empire and the Archons will surely agree with his views."

 YAL_cooperation_offer:0 "Into the Fold"
 YAL_cooperation_offer_desc:0 "Archon Eros VII has been appointed regent of his Imperial Majesty Grover VI, with Archon Proteus III part of the ruling council. Our citizens clamour to rejoin the Empire and enjoy the benefits of the Archons’ benign guidance. Who are we to deny the people their birthright of Imperial citizenship?"

 YAL_biological_sciences:0 "The Science of Life"
 YAL_biological_sciences_desc:0 "Gamia is known for its biology department. While most universities have codes of conduct that restrict their attempts to conduct experiments on the living, this university is dedicated to a pure form of knowledge acquisition. Now, nothing will hold Gamia’s biologists back."

 YAL_initiate_research:0 "Unlimited Potential"
 YAL_initiate_research_desc:0 "With Yale quickly turning away from conventional ethics, there is an opportunity to remove the last obstacles to scientific progress. By altering guidelines and regulations that bar unlimited experimentation, our full potential will finally be unlocked."

 YAL_griffon_biology:0 "Griffon Biology"
 YAL_griffon_biology_desc:0 "We must begin our research at the basis. The griffon body. A unique blend of several different types of animals, it is clear that the griffon has adapted to a level of complexity beyond anything else on this planet. Some griffons even have some potential for certain types of magic, further proving our superiority."

 YAL_encourage_student_research:0 "Encourage Student Research"
 YAL_encourage_student_research_desc:0 "The students, especially the younger ones, are still a bit weary of going along with our methods. However, there is much potential in Gamia and we must encourage these griffons to let go of any ‘morality’ they got taught outside these walls. Progress is the ultimate goal."

 YAL_delve_deeper:0 "Delve Deeper"
 YAL_delve_deeper_desc:0 "Our research is expanding our fields of vision and the future is becoming ever clearer. The griffon body and its energy, divine essence, life itself. These are not, should not, be the domain of just the Gods. Understanding and manipulating these essential concepts is within our reach. It won’t be much longer now. . ."

 YAL_project_auferstehung:0 "Project Auferstehung"
 YAL_project_auferstehung_desc:0 "Life, as it is commonly understood, is an ending process. However, science may yet pierce the veil that separates the living from the death and retrieve a soul lost to our world. Imagine the implications!"

 YAL_project_weihe:0 "Project Weihe"
 YAL_project_weihe_desc:0 "Objectively, the Gods hold the most knowledge about the world and therefore, their instructions should be followed. However, the great distance between us and the heavens has made their word unclear and up to interpretation. What if we could retrieve this information directly at the source?"

 YAL_project_wohlstand:0 "Project Wohlstand"
 YAL_project_wohlstand_desc:0 "The world is run by a very complex system of trade, prices and economic laws. But the griffon mind was never constructed to properly take advantage of these systems, as the inferior understanding of our colleagues in Middenheim demonstrates perfectly. Altering the mind is not beyond our ability, however. . ."


###Non-Alligned###
 YAL_central_universities:0 "The Central Universities"
 YAL_central_universities_desc:0 "The universities of Greenback, Greengate and Middenheim all have different specialties, but their leadership shares a similar vision. Ultimately, the goal of science is to serve society. Whether it is with new medicine, new technology or by increasing prosperity, we will work for a better future!"

 YAL_greengate_engineering:0 "Greengate’s Engineering"
 YAL_greengate_engineering_desc:0 "The foremost engineers, both electronic and mechanical, have made Greengate their favoured university. The university is close to Greenback, the industrial beating heart of the country. The engineers of Greengate are eager to receive more funding, promising quick returns in technical advancements!"

 YAL_radar_research:0 "Project Sentinel"
 YAL_radar_research_desc:0 "For some time now, Greengate’s engineers have dreamt of our own RADAR system. Not only will such an array provide us with invaluable scientific data, the listening post would help us keep an eye on our neighbours and spot incoming aircraft. Of course, there is a price tag involved."

 YAL_better_air_detection:0 "Watch Everything"
 YAL_better_air_detection_desc:0 "Project Sentinel is a resounding success and the data is flowing in. However, our scientists hunger for more data to crunch, while our military command is eager to see even more of our rivals’ movements. A little more funding could mean we can improve our Sentinel stations even more!"

 YAL_industrial_engineering:0 "The Machine Spirit"
 YAL_industrial_engineering_desc:0 "A group of very dedicated engineers have begun wearing robes in our university and they also seem weirdly obsessed with prosthetics. They are really knowledgeable, but they maybe care a bit too much about their prized machinery. Their innovations may serve us well, but let’s leave them alone with their machine spirit."

 YAL_synthetic_research:0 "Transmutating the Black Gold"
 YAL_synthetic_research_desc:0 "Greengate University’s heritage goes all the way back to that of griffon alchemists. These proto-scientists diligently worked to use magic and science to make lead into gold. Of course, without modern techniques, their efforts were doomed to fail. But some of our engineers are insisting that we give it another try!"

 YAL_form_computer_faculty:0 "Found the Computing Faculty"
 YAL_form_computer_faculty_desc:0 "Mathematics is the foundation for all science, in fact it is the frame through which we understand the fundamental processes of our world. Visionaries already dreamt of Automatic Computers, but with electronics and mechanics combined, our new Computing Faculty will lead the way into the future!"

 YAL_encryption_decryption:0 "The Wingaarden Theorem"
 YAL_encryption_decryption_desc:0 "Adriaan van Wingaarden, a Feathisian mechanical engineer, is making amazing breakthroughs in the field of computer technology! We should head his ideas closely and make sure that our Computing Faculty stays up to date in this new and boundless field of innovation!"

 YAL_pioneers_in_engineering:0 "Pioneers in Engineering"
 YAL_pioneers_in_engineering_desc:0 "Greengate University has become a campus full of exciting possibilities! The experiments and theories conducted there seem way beyond the possible. The machines built there will revolutionise modern life when they become available for the public. These pioneers are paving the way towards a better tomorrow!"

 YAL_health_sciences:0 "Greenback’s Academy of Medicine"
 YAL_health_sciences_desc:0 "The largest city of the country is also one of many problems. Hard work in the factory, pollution and poverty all harm many griffons. The Greenback Academy of Medicine has done miracles to advance the medical sciences. With substantial support, cures that seem decades away can be achieved within reasonable time!"

 YAL_greenback_hospital:0 "Greenback University Hospital"
 YAL_greenback_hospital_desc:0 "Close to the University of Greenback stands the biggest hospital in Yale, where thousands are being threated simultaneously. It is also the training ground for many doctors in training and a place where through trial and error, science advances slowly. Some refurbishments, extra staff and a new wing are sorely needed to keep our healthcare in order."

 YAL_modernised_medical_procedures:0 "Modernised Medical Procedures"
 YAL_modernised_medical_procedures_desc:0 "The lessons from Greenback will have to be rolled out across the country, if we are to keep our entire population healthy. Every death is a tragedy and with the latest medical technology for all hopsitals we can keep more griffons alive. Our demographic scientists predict that this may lead to a population boom!"

 YAL_pharmacology:0 "Pharmacology"
 YAL_pharmacology_desc:0 "The study of the practical application of new medicine is an up and coming branch of health sciences. Most academics spend too much time in laboratories, crafting up theories and doing controlled tests. Let us focus on how medicine works in the real world, as better medicines will benefit both the people and the army."

 YAL_enhancement_drugs:0 "Combat Stimulants"
 YAL_enhancement_drugs_desc:0 "Our soldiers are subject to all sort of hardships, both physical and mental. The griffon body already has a lot of ways to deal with them, such as adrenaline. However, to give our soldiers a better chance, we can increase their combat effectiveness and perhaps make life at the front slightly easier. Of course, we do not have conclusive data to support that these drugs have any negative side-effects."

 YAL_magical_potential:0 "Magical Potential"
 YAL_magical_potential_desc:0 "The griffon body is different than the one of the unicorn or the changeling, but we are still able to perform acts that could be classified as magical. We must research what makes a griffon magical. How can we alter and increase this? Is magic something immaterial or is there an organ responsible for this? Who knows what we will find after a little research? "

 YAL_unravel_the_mind:0 "Unravel the Mind"
 YAL_unravel_the_mind_desc:0 "The brain sits mightily atop the body, controlling every movement and processing every piece of information it receives, without us consciously thinking it. How curious that we now contemplate the contemplator. How do we think? What did the Gods give us that makes us conscious of our own existence? Is it possible to find out? We must know!"

 YAL_understand_the_body:0 "Understand the Body"
 YAL_understand_the_body_desc:0 "The body houses our soul and our mind, but is the most curious part of this trio. Its complexity and harmony seem to always reveal new depths. It is clear that with each step we take towards understanding our basic physical characteristics, more questions reveal themselves. But knowledge is the reward of the faithful searcher. Knowledge that could save lives. "

 YAL_promise_of_health:0 "The Oath of the Physician"
 YAL_promise_of_health_desc:0 "“I will use treatment to help the sick according to my ability, but never with a view to injury. Into each house I enter, I will enter to help the sick, and I will abstain from all intentional wrong-doing. And what I shall see or hear in the course of my profession, I will hold to be holy secrets. If I carry out this oath, may I gain reputation among all griffons for my art; but if I break it, may the opposite befall me.”"

 YAL_middenheim_business_university:0 "Middenheim School of Economics"
 YAL_middenheim_business_university_desc:0 "With ever more goods being produced and international trade linking the world more closely, the profession of economics has received increased attention. Middenheim, Yale’s leading centre of economists, rejects the alternate models of communists, choosing to improve capitalist theories instead."

 YAL_art_of_negotiation:0 "The Art of Negotiation"
 YAL_art_of_negotiation_desc:0 "“The worst thing you can do in a negotiation is seem desperate to make it. That makes the other bird smell blood, and then you're dead. Leverage is the biggest strength you can have. Leverage is having something the other griffon wants.  Or better yet, simply can't do without. Unfortunately, that isn't always the case, which is why leverage often requires imagination and salesgriffship.”"

 YAL_stock_investiture:0 "National Stock Effort"
 YAL_stock_investiture_desc:0 "For the stock market to be of the greatest benefit to the economy, shareholders should have a long term vision. By increasing the state shares of our most important firms and encouraging investors to keep their stocks for longer terms, our nation will reap the benefits. "

 YAL_clawnes:0 "Lord Meynard Clawnes"
 YAL_clawnes_desc:0 "The economy is a circular flow of money and spending is the crux to prosperity. A lack of confidence in the economy stops consumption, creating depression. To increase the flow of capital, states can keep spending to kickstart the economy. Even war spending will create jobs, just use the money!"

 YAL_government_oversight:0 "Government Oversight"
 YAL_government_oversight_desc:0 "The market is fickle and prone to failure. We must give the government more discretion to intervene, balancing public and private interests. Using equations and models, we can determine where money is needed to get the highest growth. The economy is a car-engine and it demands tuning."

 YAL_state_investments_industry:0 "Boost Aggregate Demand"
 YAL_state_investments_industry_desc:0 "It is indeed demand that determines the strength of the economy. The state can boost demand by embarking on public works projects. The money spent on these works will multiply as it circulates in the economy and gets used by workers to buy other products."

 YAL_steer_the_market:0 "Steer the Market"
 YAL_steer_the_market_desc:0 "The Yalian economy must focus on boosting demand and spending in the economy. Money trapped in the bank accounts of greedy griffons cannot help grow the economy and the more money is trapped, the harder economic growth will become. Let us keep spending and proclaim “We’re all Clawnesians now!”"

 YAL_hawk:0 "August von Hawk"
 YAL_hawk_desc:0 "The economy is not simply put into one equation, but is the culmination of the actions and motivations of all beings. Only real savings and real advancement can grow the economy not an increase of available money. Bailouts, state investments and other such matters distort the market, creating bubbles and keeping losers on top. It is time to get sober and start saving."

 YAL_self_regulated_companies:0 "Self-Regulation"
 YAL_self_regulated_companies_desc:0 "Companies go after their own interest, but only the biggest companies have the power to influence our government directly, distorting the market by rules that benefit them. The only real way to make markets work, is if the state retreats from the arena, so that the market can get the prices right."

 YAL_cleansing_katerin:0 "Cleansing Katerin"
 YAL_cleansing_katerin_desc:0 "Nowhere is the gift of the gods so twisted as the cursed lands of the Katerin Principality. Long ago, the light of Boreas and the might of Arcturius claimed these lands from the darkness that dwelled there. However, their servants failed to destroy all the roots of evil, and it has been allowed to fester anew. Only the Herald of Boreas will be able to cleanse this stain from the map once and for all!"

 YAL_align_the_griffons:0 "Warding the West"
 YAL_align_the_griffons_desc:0 "The griffons of Strawberry and Feathisia have strayed far from the path of righteousness. Instead of looking to spiritual matters, many of them are tainted by some of their more worldly desires. If we are to unite the Heartlands in the name of Boreas, these realms cannot be absent."

 YAL_expand_mission_of_boreas:0 "Expand the Mission of Boreas"
 YAL_expand_mission_of_boreas_desc:0 "Now that the Heartlands are ours, we have created a sanctuary for the faithful, but we cannot stop here. The Herald’s message must be spread to the far corners of the continent, until every griffon has heard of the world! This will be a massive undertaking, but with divine inspiration, we will labour until it is complete."

 YAL_boreas_wrath:0 "The Wrath of Boreas"
 YAL_boreas_wrath_desc:0 "We must consider that not all griffons will let our missionaries work in peace. They will hate us, for we tell them a truth they may not be willing to accept. We wish to unite all griffons in peace, but to do this, we will have to master both Boreas’s mercy and his wrath."

 YAL_mandatory_prayers:0 "Mandatory Prayers"
 YAL_mandatory_prayers_desc:0 "Although it is not generally the desire of Boreas to dictate the life of griffonkind, he requires a small sacrifice from all of us. To understand him and to align ourselves to him, he requires prayers. It is only a small sacrifice, for an eternal reward."

 YAL_internal_affairs:0 "Internal Affairs"
 YAL_internal_affairs_desc:0 "Although we are mostly focussed on spreading the message outwards, there are still affairs of a worldly order to consider. Ruling our griffons and overseeing Boreas’s peace is an enormous task, but with Boreas’s teachings, we will be able to improve the lives of all in his realm and keep the peace."

 YAL_firewings_military_school:0 "Kama Academy"
 YAL_firewings_military_school_desc:0 "There are two academies dedicated to military schools of though in Yale, Kama and Canterberley. Within recent years, there has been a division of philosophy between the two schools, fostering a deepening rivalry. Kama has been a proponent of the infant theories on mechanized tactics, looking to develop a military centred around armoured formations and combined arms warfare."

 YAL_mobile_warfare:0 "School of Experimental Warfare"
 YAL_mobile_warfare_desc:0 "Staffed by professors who served as attachés to Griffenheim and the Changeling Empire, the School of Experimental Warfare has quickly come to dominate Kama Academy. This department has heavily promoted theories of combined arms warfare, hoping to replicate the success of the Changeling army in becoming an efficient fighting force."

 YAL_superior_firepower:0 "School of Artillery and Engineering"
 YAL_superior_firepower_desc:0 "The School of Artillery and Engineering is the academy’s oldest faculty. While they’ve experienced a decline in recent years, they still hold considerable sway within campus politics. While they appreciate the effectiveness of armoured vehicles, they favour them in a supporting role alongside traditional infantry formations, backed by big guns and overwhelming firepower."

 YAL_fight_fire_with_fire:0 "Developing the Guns"
 YAL_fight_fire_with_fire_desc:0 "Our existing artillery is poorly equipped for dealing with armoured vehicles, employing high explosive shells with little armour penetrating potential. Our eventual tanks will require a new type of cannon and shell, focusing more of velocity and armour penetration. The best part, these cannons can be used independent of armour until we’ve finished development on a tank chassis."

 YAL_improved_barrel_designs:0 "Modern Infantry"
 YAL_improved_barrel_designs_desc:0 "In mechanized warfare, infantry still has an important role to play. While armour is meant to slice through hostile lines, and isolate defending units, infantry is still necessary when dealing with these pockets or heavily defended strongpoints. As such, we should focus on training and equipping our infantry in a manner which allows them to more efficiently accomplish this task."

 YAL_improved_tank_designs:0 "Developing the Tank"
 YAL_improved_tank_designs_desc:0 "Investments into the development of new guns, armaments, engines, and armour have finally allowed us a chance to design and begin work on our very first tanks. With these, we can begin to put our meticulously crafted doctrine into practice, giving us some much-needed experience with combined arms warfare."

 YAL_stick_with_the_doctrine:0 "Kama War Games"
 YAL_stick_with_the_doctrine_desc:0 "Kama Academy has taken advantage of Yale’s rolling plains, using them to conduct an intricate war game to test out the feasibility of combined arms doctrine. While these wargames will use very little actual tanks, instead opting for crudely armoured tractors, they will provide valuable insight into the tactics and logistics of motorized armies."

 YAL_organized_blitzkrieg:0 "Armoured Research Grant"
 YAL_organized_blitzkrieg_desc:0 "The Rectors are very impressed by the progress of Kama Academy, awarding the institute a highly lucrative research grant. They hope, that with this money, the school will move beyond catching up with foreign manufacturers and will instead become a leader in tank design, development, and implementation."

 YAL_new_tank_models:0 "Lessons from Griffenheim"
 YAL_new_tank_models_desc:0 "Griffenheim rocked Griffonia when they announced the creation of the continent’s first armoured division. At the time, experts from Kama were attached to this unit and given valuable insight on how tanks were developed, mustered, and used in training. It’s hoped that these experts will be able to replicate these designs and implement them effectively into the Yale Security Force."

 YAL_infantry_mechanisation:0 "The Grifftruck"
 YAL_infantry_mechanisation_desc:0 "The Grifftruck is a staple of the Griffonian Empire, being used from Feathisia to Bronzehill and from the Strawberry Duchy down to Yale. It is cheap, rugged, and easy to produce, being suited for the empire’s rough terrain and poor infrastructure. This vehicle would be the perfect addition to our armed forces, allowing us to rapidly move our troops into combat."

 YAL_heavier_tanks:0 "Lessons from the Changeling Empire"
 YAL_heavier_tanks_desc:0 "The Changeling Empire is the forefathers of armoured warfare, developing much of the doctrine and norms that have become associated with it. For a while, attaches from Kama were given a chance to work with the Changelings, giving us a look at tank designs decades ahead of Griffonia. By replicating these designs, we would no doubt gain a decisive edge over our opponents."

 YAL_armour_power:0 "Kama School of Armoured Design"
 YAL_armour_power_desc:0 "The Kama School of Armoured Design was created in order to pool together the greatest engineering minds in Yale. Their duty is to look at developments in armoured design, both foreign and domestic, and implement them into future tanks in order to ensure that we have the fastest, strongest, and most well armed tanks in Griffonia."

 YAL_new_guns:0 "Updating the Service Rifle"
 YAL_new_guns_desc:0 "The backbone of an effective infantry formation is the rifle which every solider carries. However, the standard issue rifle of Yale is severely out of date with many of the troops in our security forces still using black powder muskets. In order to address this, the Council of Rectors has awarded Kama with a generous grant to modernize Yale’s service rifle."

 YAL_modern_artillery:0 "Reinvigorating the Artillery Corp"
 YAL_modern_artillery_desc:0 "When the School of Artillery and Engineering first formed, its officers were trained on muzzle loaded cannons. Yet, decades later little innovation has been made beyond this, causing the school to lag behind modern developments in design and doctrine. In order to address this, we must secure more modern armaments and properly supply the school with equipment and experts."

 YAL_battlefield_support:0 "Reinvigorating the Engineering Corp"
 YAL_battlefield_support_desc:0 "The Engineering Corp of the School of Artillery and Engineering has always played second fiddle in the department, receiving less funding, resources, and poorer quality staff. However, developments in modern warfare have shown the importance of engineers in combat roles, forcing us to re-evaluate the importance of the Engineering Corp within campus politics."

 YAL_protect_the_skies:0 "Diversify Artillery"
 YAL_protect_the_skies_desc:0 "Recent innovations in aircraft design have given them an important role in combat, with the ability to harass or even decimate units from the sky. The poor industrial base of Yale has forced us to seek an alternative means of dealing with this threat. Kama has come to the rescue, proposing that artillery guns be retrofitted with a higher velocities, allowing them to shoot explosive shells into the sky."

 YAL_blazing_guns:0 "Artillery Research Grant"
 YAL_blazing_guns_desc:0 "The Rectors are very impressed by the progress shown by Kama Academy, awarding the institute a highly lucrative research grant.

 YAL_organize_the_army_desc:0 "As tensions rise across the continent, the Council of Rectors has formed the Yale Defense Council. The Defense Council acts as a body separate, though subordinate, to the Rectors and has been given the authority to acquire equipment, prepare defenses, and raise troops in order to ensure the security and safety of the Rectorate."

 YAL_stand_against_our_enemies:0 "The Council's First Dictate"
 YAL_stand_against_our_enemies_desc:0 "Yale has always been a pacifist nation, rarely using its security force for anything more than border security and disaster relief. However, as the prospects of war look likely, the Defense Council has implemented its first dictate. In it, the council put in place plans to acquire modern military equipment, increase the size of the armed forces, and begin construction on new fortifications."

 YAL_tuition_for_service:0 "The Cadet Charter"
 YAL_tuition_for_service_desc:0 "Yale suffers from a lack of recruits for its Security Force. This is due to the majority of the military age population seeking an education from one of the nation’s universities, gaining a deferment from service. In an effort to elevate this issue, the Rectors have passed the Cadet Charter which offers financial assistant to those who serve in the Security Force to use towards their future education."

 YAL_magic_infused_equipment:0 "Finance Crystal Research"
 YAL_magic_infused_equipment_desc:0 "Within recent years, there has been a growing attention given towards crystals within academia. This is due to evidence pointing towards them being an especially dense and potent source of energy, with the ability to produce more joules per kilogram than coal or oil. However, Yale has largely ignored this field of study, a mistake which must immediately be corrected."

 YAL_support_companies:0 "Modernizing our Battalions"
 YAL_support_companies_desc:0 "The growing complexity of weapons, tactics, and warfare has created a demand for niche combat roles to support our units in combat. These include engineers for besieging entrenched positions, radiococks to coordinate units, and logistics specialists to organize the supplies necessary to keep a unit combat effect. In order to stay at the front of innovation, we must explore these organizational systems."

 YAL_racial_advantages:0 "Cooperate with Gamia"
 YAL_racial_advantages_desc:0 "Griffons are truly fearsome creatures with bodies that tower over their pony foes and claws which can shred even the hardiest of opponents. We must play into our natural advantages, cooperating with the biologists at Gamia to explore new and improved ways of not only exploiting our bodies within combat but using science to improve them."

 YAL_modernize_the_knights:0 "11th Century Knights"
 YAL_modernize_the_knights_desc:0 "While many of our neighbours have capitalized upon the usage of knights, our nation has never seen the benefit of training and equipping such elite warriors. However, as conflict creeps ever closer, many within the Council of Rectors are calling for the establishment of a Knight Corp within Yale, trained and equipped in a manner befitting modern special forces."

 YAL_brains_of_the_battlefield:0 "Yale Chiefs of Staff"
 YAL_brains_of_the_battlefield_desc:0 "The Defense Council has served its purpose well, properly guiding the Yale Security Force from humble roots to a truly modern combat force.

 YAL_stormshields_military_school:0 "Canterberley Academy"
 YAL_stormshields_military_school_desc:0 "There are two academies dedicated to military schools of though in Yale, Kama and Canterberley. Within recent years, there has been a division of philosophy between the two schools, fostering a deepening rivalry. Canterberley holds onto its traditional roots, taking after the success of the Griffonian army in using infantry heavy formations and meticulously drafted battleplans."

 YAL_grand_battleplan:0 "The Old Guard"
 YAL_grand_battleplan_desc:0 "The Old Guard dominant politics within Canterberley Academy, making up the bulk of senior academics and the academy’s board of directors.

 YAL_trench_digging_excercises:0 "Theorize the Gerhard Line"
 YAL_trench_digging_excercises_desc:0 "Gerhard Silverbeak is one of Canterberley Academy’s most famed teachers, with his curriculum heavily focused upon the importance of fighting on the defensive. Within recent years, he has begun to adapt modern military innovations into his planning, designing one of the most comprehensive and unbreakable defensive frameworks within the Griffonian continent."

 YAL_motorisation_of_divisions:0 "The Motorized Experiment"
 YAL_motorisation_of_divisions_desc:0 "Planners from Kama have preached the importance of rapidly moving combat formations, putting them at the centre of their military theory. Canterberley can not be blind to these innovations and should establish an exploratory committee which will look into the integration of trucks and tanks within our existing infantry formations."

 YAL_officer_training:0 "The Canterberley Council"
 YAL_officer_training_desc:0 "The Canterberley Council is a body composed of the academy’s eight most senior and seasoned academics, who combined have almost two centuries of military experience. Their duty is to act as a thinktank, theorizing elaborate scenarios and developing strategies to deal with them. Through their service, Yale will be prepared for any possible disaster or war."

 YAL_organised_defence:0 "Develop the Gerhard Line"
 YAL_organised_defence_desc:0 "The Council of Rectors has given the go ahead to begin development on the Gerhard Line, with a series of strongpoints being developed along certain favourable terrain. When finished, this line would ensure the security of Yale from outside threats."

 YAL_fortress_yale:0 "First Phase Completed"
 YAL_fortress_yale_desc:0 "The first phase of the Gerhard Line has been completed with the development of a basic system of strongpoints throughout the nation. While the current system may seem lacking, when finished, it will provide an intricate system of defense-in-depth which will offer security from even the most unrelenting of foes."

 YAL_expand_ammunition_production:0 "Standardize our Service Rifle"
 YAL_expand_ammunition_production_desc:0 "Currently, battalions of the Yale Security Force are sponsored by the nation’s universities. These campuses are each responsible for the equipping of their units, meaning that two campuses can contract drastically different arms manufacturers, creating a logistical nightmare. In an effort to address this, the Defense Council has drafted a short list of approved manufacturers."

 YAL_extend_military_service:0 "Militarize the Clubs"
 YAL_extend_military_service_desc:0 "Canterberley Academy, along with other universities, host a number of clubs and organizations, which the student body is encouraged to join.

 YAL_national_fortification_effort:0 "Canterberley Youth League"
 YAL_national_fortification_effort_desc:0 "The age of admission for Canterberley Academy is 14, meaning that a significant minority of the student body is below the age of enlistment. However, they can still contribute meaningfully towards the war effort, providing much need labour for the construction of fortified hardpoints and digging of trench networks."

 YAL_infantry_power:0 "The Canterberley Battalions"
 YAL_infantry_power_desc:0 "The rigorous training of Canterberley’s cadets has created a class of officers who are dedicated in their service to Yale. Canterberley officer attack harder, defend to the last, and can push their units farther than their counterparts at Kama. These Canterberley Battalions will provide the perfect backbone for the future of the Yale Security Force."

 YAL_mass_assault:0 "The Red Guard"
 YAL_mass_assault_desc:0 "The Red Guard are a group of students who are closely linked with academics and professors of Cyrusval University. They are politically motivated and have fallen hard for leftist ideals.

 YAL_tweak_conscription_requirements:0 "County Campuses"
 YAL_tweak_conscription_requirements_desc:0 "The Red Guard have called upon Canterberley Academy to establish provisional campuses throughout Yale, making their education more accessible to the entire population. It is hoped that through this, a greater number of griffons can receive a military education, drastically increasing the size of our reserves."

 YAL_sharing_is_caring:0 "Redifining Doctrine"
 YAL_sharing_is_caring_desc:0 "Previously, Canterberley’s doctrine for surrounded unit focused on attempting a breakout and linking back up with the frontline. In the event this failed, a surrender was to be made in order to preserve life in the face of defeat. However, the Red Guard criticizes this philosophy, believing that surrounded units can still fulfil a very important role of tying down enemy battalions."

 YAL_wave_tactics:0 "Conscript the Unions"
 YAL_wave_tactics_desc:0 "Universities runs on more than just academics. There is a whole support network of janitors, chefs, mechanics, groundskeepers, and various other jobs which are necessary to keep the campus running. All of these support staff are mandated to join a campus union which looks after their collective interests. With conflict on the horizon, union members will now be liable for conscription."

 YAL_infantry_first:0 "Revolutionizing Doctrine"
 YAL_infantry_first_desc:0 "The concept of mass assault is hard to swallow. It calls for what is in essentially griffon wave tactics, throwing walls of young cocks and hens into the meat grinder that is combat. However, the adoption of this philosophy on warfare is the only viable option for a nation as poor in industry and resources as Yale."

 YAL_feathered_swarm:0 "The Red Guard Seize Control"
 YAL_feathered_swarm_desc:0 "In a stunning vote, the Canterberley Board voted 5-3 in favour of appointing Heinz Featherhoff as headmaster of the academy. Featherhoff is regarded as the only senior academic whose views aligned with those of The Red Guard. With his appointment, it is expected that Canterberley Academy will continue to experience further reforms in management and doctrine."

 yale.1.d:0 "Things have been rough at the Great Archives’ construction site. Deliveries of supplies not arriving on time, unusually bad weather and a series of small cases of plain bad luck have together caused a serious delay. No griffon in particular is to blame, but the project will take significantly longer now."
 yale.1.a:0 "Recalculate the timetables. Again."
 
 yale.2.t:0 "Demand for more Funding"
 yale.2.d:0 "“What do you mean, you forgot to put a zero behind that price? You incompetent son of a pony!”\n\nThe head administrator of the Archives project raged uncontrollably at one of his clerks. Of course, the poor griffon could not magically summon a sack of gold coins, so there was little use. The fact remained. The project had way over its already ridiculously high budget. He had to ask the government to increase funding gone, or risk further delays."
 yale.2.a:0 "Increase funding!"
 yale.2.b:0 "Not a penny more."

 yale.3.t:0 "Precious Materials Lost"
 yale.3.d:0 "The marble used for the statues and pillars of the Archives comes from all over Griffonia and sadly, even the transports for such a noble project aren’t always safe from the many dangers and nuisances that cloud Boreas’s realm. Several transports of marble and other valuable materials have been lost to banditry or held up due to red tape at one of the many border crossings. The problem has become so profound that some of our artists and construction workers lack the materials to continue the construction on schedule. We will have to take additional time before the Archives can be opened."
 yale.3.a:0 "If only we griffons could cooperate for the common good."
  
 yale.4.t:0 "A Touch of Genius, A Hint of Madness"
 yale.4.d:0 "The designs left by the great visionary, Borean Wiedergreiff, are both ingenious and cryptic. It is clear that the architect-scholar had accounted for many of the problems we now face, but sometimes it is hard to decipher the griffon’s notoriously bad handwriting and ambiguous use of terms.\n\nHowever, with careful study, the architects have managed to decipher a key part of the building plans, which would drastically decrease the needed strength for the Archives’ support structure. The project carries on, with significant savings in both material and time."
 yale.4.a:0 "He truly thought of everything."
 
 yale.5.t:0 "To Err on the Side of Caution"
 yale.5.d:0 "Although construction projects are notoriously optimistic when it comes to their projections of the cost and time of their project, it seems that for once, the foregriffs and architects have been to cautious. Work has been going smoothly, helped by good weather for the season and a lack of sick absentees. We can confidently shave some weeks off the construction time."
 yale.5.a:0 "Let us not waste our good fortunes."
 
 yale.6.t:0 "A Most Welcome Donation"
 yale.6.d:0 "A well-known historian, once a student of the famous Borean Wiedergreiff, has given a donation to the construction effort. Although the donation includes much needed funds, the real treasure is a bundle of texts from the master himself, describing his architectural visions, along with some unique sketches and plans for the Archives. With another perspective on the project, we may be able to increase our construction speed substantially!"

 yale.8.d:0 "The question of the gods’, and more specifically of Boreas’s, true nature had been fascinating the scholars of Yale for a long time. Now, with the most modern techniques and a scientific curiosity some more conservative griffons would call unholy madness, the Yale observatory was ready to pierce into the Heavenly Domain of the Gods.\n\nTheologists, astronomers and physicists collaborated in ‘Project Weihe’, pinpointing the supposed location of Boreas in the night sky, while the most talented engineers prepared the technical instruments which would tear open a path to see into heaven.\n\nAnd on one fateful night, the project was set, and both audio and visual data was coming in from the intricate machinery set up in the university. First nothing, but if the griffons looked close enough, something materialised before their very eyes. Someone, in fact! An intelligent looking, stern, pale, featherless griffon looked back down. His beak seemed distorted in the image, but there was no doubt that this was the face of Boreas. The researchers became ever more excited, they had definitively proven the existence of God! Amidst the excited chatter of self-important scientists congratulating each other, the audio instruments picked up a message: In old Imperial script he proclaimed: "T Genus Emptio."\n\nThis instruction confused the scholars and the theologists present could not place this divine command in any context. When the scholars tried to re-establish contact with Boreas later, the image never appeared again, nor were there anymore messages from the heavens. Perhaps it was better if the wider world did not learn about Boreas’s true message. . . "

 yale.12.d:0 "Today, a strange envelop arrived in the mailbox of the Rector Magnificus. It was odd, as it contained the seal of that very same office. When his aide handed him the curious letter, it became clear that it came from before their lifetimes…\n\n“To the recipient of this letter,\n\nThis letter is meant as both congratulations and gratitude for your services for the good of griffonkind. So, if you would indulge me, I would like to address a few words to you. In my lifetime, which has undoubtedly passed when you receive this letter, many amazing discoveries have been made, for good and ill, out of lust for wealth and power, or for fear of the power of others. I hope you find yourself in more enlightened times than I do, but I fear that not much has changed in our basic mentality. I do hope my preparations for Yale have been of some aid to your efforts to break this cycle and use science to pursue peace.\n\nPerhaps, if I was lucky, you were taught in university that all scientists stand on the shoulders of those who came before and I would be most humbled if I were amongst those giants. However, this is not the entire truth. We stand on the shoulders of all beings, who in their labours provide the circumstances for us to move forwards. Scientific progress is not owed to scientists, but to the people that enable scientists to do their research. Thus, from this concludes that it is all of society that deserves the fruits of the scientist’s work.\n\nThis truth may seem self-evident, but if your journey as a leader has been the same as mine, you must have had many doubts. You could have let doubts about security and the things you hold dear get in the way of using the unique position you were given for the good of those who entrusted it to you. I sincerely thank you for having not given in to those desires even in your darkest hour and the hope of your people must be that you remain this strong.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJust one being, Borean Wiedergreiff.”\n\nThe Rector stared at the paper for a while, before smiling. The enigmatic founder of Yale always had one last surprise, this one heart-warming. The griffon’s final wish did indeed come to pass. "

 YAL_university_focused_research_desc:0 "An effort to focus research in particular fields by directing scientists from different universities in a centralised way is increasing the speed at which we can conduct military and industrial Research and Development operations."
 YAL_equipment_focus:0 "Focus on Personal Weapon Development"
 YAL_equipment_focus_desc:0 "Infantry are still the primary fighting force of any nation and they are equipped with small arms. Rifles, machine guns, mortars, grenades and anti-tank weaponry in the claws of sturdy soldiers will win any conflict."
 YAL_infantry_focus:0 "Focus on Special Forces"
 YAL_infantry_focus_desc:0 "Our country does not have the forces to spare to fill out armies of general soldiers. Our armed forces must be honed precisely to operate under any condition. For this we must devise gruelling training programs, specialised equipment and light weaponry for use in amphibious, high altitude and air landing operations."
 YAL_support_focus:0 "Focus on Support Equipment"
 YAL_support_focus_desc:0 "Our research is focused on improving the design of our support equipment. The small things such as recon equipment, shovels, radios and field hospitals can proof decisive in combat. Using knowledge from the army itself, along with theory and doctrine, we will be able to make a decisive push in this field."
 YAL_artillery_focus:0 "Focus on Artillery Research"
 YAL_artillery_focus_desc:0 "The adage of the imperial military has always been that Arcturius is on the side with the most artillery. This is not an unwise statement, as those who can bring the most firepower to bear on an enemy will surely have a decisive advantage. With larger calibres, advanced explosive or armour piercing ammunitions and better targeting, we will be able to enhance the killing potential of our support weapons."
 YAL_land_doctrine_focus:0 "Focus on Army Doctrine"
 YAL_land_doctrine_focus_desc:0 "A soldier that is not present on the battlefield is as useful as a dead griffon. Waging war is a logistical operation of an unprecedented scale and the strategy behind our campaigns will have to be carefully considered. By adapting from the lessons learned by generals from all over the world, we will be able to improve our own doctrine."
 YAL_industry_focus:0 "Focus on Industrial Development"
 YAL_industry_focus_desc:0 "Ultimately a war is won by the amount of griffons we will be able to arm, the amount of planes and ships we will be able to construct and the resources we will be able to extract. Therefore the most direct increase to our capacity to wage war will come through improving our assembly lines, extraction tools and countrywide logistical operations."
 YAL_racial_focus:0 "Focus on Griffology"
 YAL_racial_focus_desc:0 "The griffon body and mind and the magic feats it can produce are an untapped well of research. Enchanting could strengthen modern armour and make our tools more efficient. Magic and science can be melded together to create spectacular results with practical implications."
 YAL_armor_focus:0 "Focus on Pantzer Research"
 YAL_armor_focus_desc:0 "Armoured warfare has the future, as the speed, firepower and protection a tank offers are unrivalled by more traditional weapons. However, the potential improvements to these weapon platforms are clear. Better guns, smart anti-personnel weaponry and the integration of electronic technologies will pave the way to victory."
 YAL_electronics_focus:0 "Focus on Electronics Research"
 YAL_electronics_focus_desc:0 "Although electricity as a power source is not new, technology powered by it keeps advancing. Most curious are the implications for long range detection technology which could warn of approaching hostiles and the usage of electromechanical computers to solve mathematic equations are amongst the two most interesting ones."
 YAL_naval_focus:0 "Focus on Ship Design"
 YAL_naval_focus_desc:0 "Our nation did not traditionally possess an oceangoing navy, but now that it borders the sea, it is imperative that we copy and improve naval designs to build our own fleet. The RFP will contribute to our new and modern navy."
 YAL_naval_doctrine_focus:0 "Focus on Naval Doctrine"
 YAL_naval_doctrine_focus_desc:0 "Without a destination, no wind is favourable, thus we must direct our navy or it will simply fall apart in a real combat situation. Developing doctrines for this new naval program will be challenging, as combat takes place beneath the waves, on the seas and above it. We will have to devise a strategy to match our ambitions and our potential opponents."
 YAL_air_focus:0 "Focus on Aeroplane Design"
 YAL_air_focus_desc:0 "Airplanes have a role to play in new conflicts. Aircraft design is advances at a rapid pace, however, and the Research Focus Program can assist in providing our own designs. More nimble and better armed fighter planes or bombers able to deliver more payload, different design philosophies can lead to radically different planes and we ought to make the planes that suit our needs."
 YAL_air_doctrine_focus:0 "Focus on Air Doctrine"
 YAL_air_doctrine_focus_desc:0 "The unique properties of airpower require a separate doctrine to set it apart from land -or in our case, non-mechanised flying- forces. The ability to project force quickly and reach over enemy frontlines into their heartlands bring new strategic considerations to the table. We must carefully consider how to use our air force in the way that will suit our military objectives."

 #Revolution Decisions

 YAL_revolution_support:0 "Preparing for Revolution"
 YAL_revolution_support_desc:0 "Now that Cyrusval University has taken the lead amongst the universities of Yale, it has started to plot for a revolution in secret. By using the Student Vanguard and the Faculty of Social Science to its advantage, the hopeful revolutionaries seek to shore up support of the workers, soldiers and intellectuals in Yale. Increasing support will take time and effort, but launching the revolution too soon may have disastrous consequences.\n\n\n\nCurrent §Rworker§! support: [?YAL_worker_support|Y0].\nCurrent §Mintellectual§! support: [?YAL_intellectual_support|Y0].\nCurrent §Ymilitary§! support: [?YAL_military_support|Y0]."
 YAL_for_the_workers:0 "Go to the Factories"
 YAL_for_the_workers_desc:0 "The Student Vanguard will mingle in the factories, speaking to ordinary workers to preach about the revolution. Not only will they help increase revolutionary sentiment in the factories, they may also learn a thing or two about industrial methods."
 YAL_for_the_soldiers:0 "Go to the Soldiers"
 YAL_for_the_soldiers_desc:0 "Our military is not impressive, but it will be a formidable foe for our revolution. Luckily, the underpaid and underappreciated soldiers of Yale will be more than willing to listen to the promises made by the Student Vanguard."
 YAL_work_for_freedom:0 "Work for Freedom"
 YAL_work_for_freedom_desc:0 "Many things must be prepared for a revolution. Not only do we need brave griffons to carry the day, we need to have provisions, medical supplies and of course banners ready. In secret, we will work that bit harder to supply our comrades in the upcoming struggle."
 YAL_secure_arms:0 "Secure Arms"
 YAL_secure_arms_desc:0 "We will make good use of our connections in the army to smuggle weapons out of the armouries. When the reactionaries try to overthrow the people’s revolution, they will be surprised to find that we have guns too. "
 YAL_historical_materialism:0 "Historical Materialism"
 YAL_historical_materialism_desc:0 "History used to be the profession of nationalists, embellishing the myths of their ancient nation to distract the griffons from their own exploitation. The Faculty will unmask this history and show a radically different outlook. The world is ruled by modes of production, which structure a class system. And the age of capitalism is reaching its end..."
 YAL_verelendung_thesis:0 "The Verelendung Thesis"
 YAL_verelendung_thesis_desc:0 "With machines replacing griffons in the production line, production increases, but wages stay the same. Capital accumulates at the top, but workers grow less and less necessary. Once proud artisans are now little more than cogs in the machine. The true contradiction of capitalism is thus: The economy grows larger, but the worker’s condition, as a necessity, becomes more miserable."
 YAL_reject_transition:0 "Reject Transition"
 YAL_reject_transition_desc:0 "The most accepted communist theories, such a practiced in Stalliongrad, favour a post-revolutionary ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’. Sadly, our comrades overseas seem to have forgotten about the temporary nature of this arrangement. To ensure that the revolution is not perverted at the final hour, we will give all means of production and power to the workers."
 YAL_free_association:0 "Free Association"
 YAL_free_association_desc:0 "The state is the premier means of oppression. If there is to be true liberty, even the most liberal of democracies will not do. Only a community of freely associated individuals can guarantee the freedom that is the right of every being. Production will be in the hands of the workers and there will be no structures of power forcing anygriffon to do anything they don’t want."

 #Archives Decisions 
 YAL_archive_building:0 "Building the Archives"
 YAL_archive_building_desc:0 "The construction of the Great Archives of Yale is a monumental task that requires swaths of funds, materials and labour. However, for the sake of all griffonkind and to fulfill the vision of the visionary Borean Wiedergreiff, we will complete this monument to scientific knowledge."
 YAL_start_building_part_1:0 "The Foundation"
 YAL_start_building_part_1_desc:0 "Mathematics are the foundation of the sciences, and without them we would not know about the true nature of the world. But just like we can base our science on sturdy mathematics, so too must the Archives be built on unshakeable foundations. Let us begin in earnest!"
 YAL_start_building_part_2:0 "The Framework"
 YAL_start_building_part_2_desc:0 "A steel and concrete framework will hold up the building and prevent it from collapsing in on itself. Like the scientific method guides our research, so will this framework keep the building stable. Borean's magical enchantments will add further protection and support to the structure."
 YAL_start_building_part_3:0 "The Structure"
 YAL_start_building_part_3_desc:0 "Next, the structure of the archives will have to be made. Borean's plans are in the shape of a great tower with many floors. Many entrypoints will make it easy for griffons to fly in at the right floor, showing both the grandeur and the openess of the scientific pursuit. This will be the brute-force part of the construction. To work!"
 YAL_start_building_part_4:0 "The Interior"
 YAL_start_building_part_4_desc:0 "Inside the Archives, the walls will be finished with marble, with sturdy bookshelves carved into the stone, to house all the knowledge of Griffonia so meticulously gathered by the universities over the years. Of course many comfortable reading rooms will be made as well, so that anygriffon can enjoy reading the works of science and literature the Archives store."
 YAL_final_touches:0 "The Decoration"
 YAL_final_touches_desc:0 "To complete the Archives, many works of art will need to be commissioned. Especially the lowest and highest level will contain frescos by renowned artists, along with statues representing the sciences. All will marvel at the greatest work of science and art the world has ever seen. It is so close now."

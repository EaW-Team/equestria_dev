### National Fouces###
NLR_volunteers:0 "New Moon Volunteers"
NLR_volunteers_desc:0 "Cults from across Equestria have risen up in support of Nightmare Moon, and have pledged not only their allegiance, but their lives in service of the Night Queen! They're joining our regular forces as we speak."
NLR_conscription:0 "Introduce Mandatory Military Service"
NLR_conscription_desc:0 "Having firearms with no ponies to fire them will not help us win this war, and the more casualties we take over the course of this war, the more likely it is we are to fail in our quest. Instituting mandatory military service for all those under our rule will bring us victory."
NLR_military_polices:0 "Military Police"
NLR_military_polices_desc:0 "Establishing a formalised military police force to watch over civilians and ensure no pony riots will be for the better. We are in a state of emergency, and any dissident should be prevented early."
NLR_faster_training:0 "Standardised Training Methods"
NLR_faster_training_desc:0 "Most of our troops are either thestral militias, cultists, or loyal Equestrian military forces that just so happen to be on the same side. This means that each group has their own recruiting and training methods. While the fact that so many ponies can come together under Nightmare Moon is admirable, standardising a single way to train for our forces will allow them to coordinate in battle more effectively."
NLR_support_NMS:0 "Support the Disciples"
NLR_support_NMS_desc:0 "The Disciples aren't doing too well down in the south, with the four way battle being fought. Giving our most loyal of fighters our direct support is the least we can do for fighting a dangerous fight."
NLR_iron_hoof:0 "A Firm Hoof"
NLR_iron_hoof_desc:0 "Our rule is fragile, at this moment, as the Loyalists that we are slowly beginning to rule over protest and attack our troops openly. If we were to let it be known that this kind of behaviour is not tolerated, the legitimacy of our rule would only get stronger."
NLR_crackdwon:0 "Crackdown on Rebel Groups"
NLR_crackdwon_desc:0 "Even though we've finally established that we will be the rightful ruler of Equestria, rebel groups loyal to Equestria still think that they have a chance at winning this war. Let us show them the error of their ways."
NLR_volunteers_2:0 "Reintegrating Local Militaries"
NLR_volunteers_2_desc:0 "At the onset of the war our cultists moved to quickly establish a military command and our activists established legitimate governments in many cities. Yet they could not be everywhere, and many military units stayed neutral or attempted to desert. Now that the situation has firmed and we have explained the nature of the conflict, local military units are reintegrating into their former structures under Nightmare Moon."
NLR_crush_resistance:0 "Destroy the Resistance"
NLR_crush_resistance_desc:0 "The Celestial Resistance has been around long enough. It is time to not only end that group that continues to be a pain, but to let any other ponies know that getting the same idea will end very, very badly."
NLR_civil_war_end:0 "The End of Civil War"
NLR_civil_war_end_desc:0 "The War has ended, but there is still much to do. Our society is fractured and there are still many rebels and traitors that wish to see Celestia restored to Equestria's throne."

NLR_reclemation:0 "Begin National Reclamation"
NLR_reclemation_desc:0 "We've finally managed to beat Celestia's cronies, but many opportunistic traitors saw the civil war as a chance to create their own states following their own ideals. With Celestia's defeat, the time has come to deal with them."
NLR_conquer_VAN:0 "Shatter Vanhoover"
NLR_conquer_VAN_desc:0 "Vanhoover, one of our largest and industrially the most important cities in the northwest was taken over by the communists during the Civil War, if we intend to protect our borders from the Changelings we must retake it."
NLR_conquer_SCS:0 "March Through The South"
NLR_conquer_SCS_desc:0 "During the Civil War practically all of the southwestern Equestrian provinces seceded, some of which formed the Confederation of Southern States. While their existence was tolerated during the war it's about time we retake our rightful land from these upstart hicks."
NLR_conquer_CES:0 "Intervene in the South-East"
NLR_conquer_CES_desc:0 "We must restore order in the southeastern jungles, and destroy the bands of criminals and traitors that roam there. The indigenous thestrals will welcome us as liberators!"

NLR_crush_stalliongrad_desc:0 "The Stalliongradian commoners think they can run a country by themselves, without guidance from an alicorn princess. They are sorely mistaken and their experiment with their strange ideology is doomed to fail. We must intervene to save their population and bring them back into the fold."
NLR_subjugate_Crystal_empire:0 "Subjugate Crystal Empire"
NLR_subjugate_Crystal_empire_desc:0 "The Crystal Empire must be restored to its rightful place as a Protectorate of the Empire, by force if necessary. We will send a loyal governor to rule their lands and ensure the Princess and her crystal ponies do not plot against us."
NLR_CHN_conflict:0 "Strike At The Changelings"
NLR_CHN_conflict_desc:0 "The blight on the land that is the Changeling Queendom is growing worryingly strong. The wicked Queen Chrysalis desires nothing but vengeance and conquest. She must be destroyed before she becomes a threat too great even for our Empress to manage."
NLR_conquer_OLE:0 "Subjugate The Deer"
NLR_conquer_OLE_desc:0 "The pathetic deer of Olenia are too weak to even defend themselves from changeling aggression. While the threat of Chrysalis is now gone, it is clear deer are incapable of governing themselves and need protection from our Empire."
NLR_conquer_YAK:0 "Tame The Yaks"
NLR_conquer_YAK_desc:0 "The yaks are savage and violent beasts. It is a miracle they managed to form a nation-state in the first place. Even then, they required Equestrian aid to begin their modernization efforts. The Lunar Empire shall intervene and bring civilization to these hapless barbarians."
NLR_conquer_GRF:0 "March Upon Weter"
NLR_conquer_GRF_desc:0 "Princess Celestia was foolish for allowing the catbird Emperor Grover I to establish a colony on our continent. Soon after its founding it became a den of scum and villainy exiled from their homeland. The backyard of Equus needs equine order, and we will provide it."
NLR_conquer_north:0 "The War At The Top Of The World"
NLR_conquer_north_desc:0 "The isolated and backwards races of northern Equus, the polar bears and the penguins, have suffered in poverty and tribalism for too long. Even though the intervention will be difficult due to local climate and terrain, it must take place."
NLR_conquer_DRG:0 "Conquer The Dragon Isles"
NLR_conquer_DRG_desc:0 "Long have dragons been a terror of ponies, but Celestia was too weak to do anything about them. Our Empress is far more determined and will crush these lizards once and for all."

NLR_civil_war_economy:0 "The New Equestrian Economy"
NLR_civil_war_economy_desc:0 "The chaos of war has been a great calamity for the Equestrian economy. For it to recover, the Empire must directly intervene and save our industry before it is too late. The economy will be completely restructured to suit the needs of the Empress."
NLR_repurpose_factories:0 "Retool The Factories"
NLR_repurpose_factories_desc:0 "The survival of the Second Lunar Empire depends entirely on arms. The more we have, the more we can give to our loyal followers, who will use them to crush our foes in battle. Civilian needs are of secondary importance; this is a matter of life or death. Our facilities must be repurposed at once, in the name of the Empress!"
NLR_expand_arms_factories:0 "The Empress Demands More Guns!"
NLR_expand_arms_factories_desc:0 "In the darkness of the night, the warm glow of vast forges bathes our cities in dim light, endlessly churning out weapons for our army. Yet it is not enough. More is always needed to supply our numerous soldiers. And we will have more. New factories will be built to satisfy our demands."
NLR_quick_oil_assembly:0 "Cover The Shortages"
NLR_quick_oil_assembly_desc:0 "While we possess a large share of Equestria’s factories, the fact remains that we are missing crucial resources such as oil. Our machines of war need it for fuel, so we shall invest into making these resources artificially, to quench our thirst for black gold."
NLR_new_mining_projects:0 "New Mining Projects"
NLR_new_mining_projects_desc:0 "There is always a demand for more raw resources, especially in the military sector of our industry. Equestrian surveyors had already identified many promising deposits, but they could not be exploited before the war began. By securing control of these areas, we can send our miners to work to feed our ever-hungry factories."
NLR_steel_milling:0 "The Queen Of Steel"
NLR_steel_milling_desc:0 "A new mandate by the Empress requires every production facility not focusing on producing war material to produce a small quantity of industrial-grade steel. Failures to fulfill this quota will be investigated and potentially punished. Our Empress will become the Queen of Steel, no matter the cost!"
NLR_lunar_mining_company:0 "Create The IM&DS"
NLR_lunar_mining_company_desc:0 "To direct our mining operations, the Imperial Mining and Drilling Service shall be established, comprised of experienced engineers, geologists, surveyors, managers and so on. They will ensure quotas are met and that the economy remains well supplied with raw resources."
NLR_radio_equestria:0 "Radio Nox"
NLR_radio_equestria_desc:0 "Around Equestria, supporters have sprung up, using the newest technology to rally supporters to our cause and boost morale in the field. A most novel idea, we shall give our official support and aid to these brave people so that ours and their messages may reach ever further on the airwaves, to be reached by soldiers and civilians alike."
NLR_tactical_computing:0 "Magical Crypto Machines"
NLR_tactical_computing_desc:0 "Encryption and decryption requires ever increasing amounts of processing power, which cannot be provided by sharp minds alone. By using crystals for storing and handling binary data, we can create rudimentary machines capable of completing complex algorithms needed by various methods of cryptology. This effort should receive Imperial Patronage."
NLR_civilian_manufacturing:0 "The Industrial Heartland"
NLR_civilian_manufacturing_desc:0 "The eastern coast of Equestria has for centuries been one of the most developed parts of the nation, especially after industrialisation took place. This means we have a strong economic core, mostly safe from the ravages of war. We should use its production capability to develop other, less developed regions, as well as expand pre-existing facilities."
NLR_connect_east_coast:0 "Connect The East Coast"
NLR_connect_east_coast_desc:0 "Eastern Equestria, although having many rich and powerful cities, lacks crucial infrastructure in the countryside. Using emergency measures, we shall direct the construction of roads and railways between Fillydelphia and Manehatten to further tie the nation together."
NLR_expand_shipyards:0 "Expand The Shipyards"
NLR_expand_shipyards_desc:0 "After the civil war began, only a portion of all the ships of the Equestrian Navy became part of the Lunar Navy. Our fleets are not worthy of the Empress and need to be expanded, but that will be a slow effort if we do not first invest in our drydocks. Only then can we create the mightiest navy of the world."
NLR_industrial_powerhouse:0 "An Economic Powerhouse"
NLR_industrial_powerhouse_desc:0 "With our Empress' most wise investments, our economy is not only recovering from the turmoil of war, it is beginning to boom. All loyal servants of the Empire shall enjoy the fruits of their labour as a new golden age of prosperity begins for our nation."
NLR_unicorn_academy_f:0 "Reopen The School For Gifted Unicorns"
NLR_unicorn_academy_f_desc:0 "Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns was Equestria's premiere educational institution for magically talented ponies. There is no reason why our Empress shouldn't become the new patron of the facility. The damages from war will be repaired and it will be reopened, welcoming promising pupils into its halls. Perhaps our Empress can even find a protege among them..."
NLR_luna_nova_f:0 "The Luna Nova Imperial Academy"
NLR_luna_nova_f_desc:0 "In a vain attempt to make amends with her sister, Princess Celestia founded the town of Luna Nova and allowed our Empress to establish an academy there. Now Celestia is gone and her loyalists have been driven out of the town, which had proven to be nothing more than a nest of traitors. Now the town will be rebuilt and its academy once more returned to its founder. It shall become more glorious than ever."
NLR_fate_of_equestrian_companies:0 "The Fate Of The Industrialists"
NLR_fate_of_equestrian_companies_desc:0 "Equestria had many wealthy capitalists and businessponies who remained loyal to Celestia during the war, funding her armies and fueling her economy. Now they shall all be brought before the Empress to be judged. Their vast possessions could be confiscated by the Empire, or they could be given another chance and allowed to cooperate with the Empress. Soon it shall be decided."
NLR_secure_the_banks:0 "Create The IBS"
NLR_secure_the_banks_desc:0 "The Equestrian banking system is in disarray after the war. Because loans and monetary services are so vital to a healthy economy, we must step in and restructure the banks. The Imperial Banking Service shall be founded, acting as the national bank and managing regional banks. With this, we hope to restore some order and make loans easy to get again."
NLR_secure_southern_oil:0 "Support The Oil Barons"
NLR_secure_southern_oil_desc:0 "The oil companies of southern Equestria control vast reserves and had questionable loyalty to Celestia during the civil war. Therefore they can be trusted to some extent. If we lend them financial support, they will be able to expand their operations and increase their oil production rates. The Empire will have a portion of this surplus in return for the generosity."
NLR_research_centre:0 "The Imperial Research Center"
NLR_research_centre_desc:0 "The Lunar Empire has many educational institutions within its borders, but not enough facilities that focus solely on technological research instead of teaching the youth. The IRC will be an answer to this problem, having some of the most brilliant minds of the Empire cooperating to push the boundaries of science for the glory of the Empire."
NLR_revive_eea:0 "Revive The EEA"
NLR_revive_eea_desc:0 "The EEA was once the authority for all education in Equestria. While it has fallen into disuse due to the civil war, our Empress has come up with a novel idea to repurpose the EEA to serve the new Lunar state in all matters educational. This will enable us to both secure our rule, and focus our educational efforts."
NLR_magical_studies_f:0 "Allponies Magical Training"
NLR_magical_studies_f_desc:0 "To take another step towards harvesting the enormous power of magic, we shall make it mandatory for all unicorns in the armed forces to participate in magical training. This way they can hone their skills and learn to use them for military purposes."

NLR_airforce:0 "Found the Lunar Air Force"
NLR_airforce_desc:0 "One thing is clear - those who control the skies control the battle. We must found a proper Lunar Air Force to achieve total victory."
NLR_air_supremecy:0 "Air Supremacy"
NLR_air_supremecy_desc:0 "First we will destroy their planes, then their armies. Combined fighter and bomber offensives are the key."
NLR_air_support:0 "Air Support"
NLR_air_support_desc:0 "Our goal lies in supporting our ground forces with all our might. A swift, easy victory on land is the key."
NLR_shadowbolts:0 "Shadowbolt Expertise"
NLR_shadowbolts_desc:0 "The elite flying group of the Shadowbolts, founded by Nightmare Moon herself, includes some of the most skilled pilots in Equestria. Their skill and expertise will surely inspire the others."
NLR_fighters:0 "Fighter Effort"
NLR_fighters_desc:0 "In order to claim the sky, we must conquer it from those who also claim it. The only way this is possible is by having the best fighters around."
NLR_cas:0 "Dive Bombers"
NLR_cas_desc:0 "Our airborne troops’ main mission is and shall always be to aid our troops on the ground. With powerful air support even the strongest of defences will crumble."
NLR_tatical_b:0 "Heavy Air Support"
NLR_tatical_b_desc:0 "Conventional dive bomber models, while effective, are not going to be sufficient for us. We need larger bomber models to provide direct air support to our troops."
NLR_strategic_b:0 "Heavy Bombers"
NLR_strategic_b_desc:0 "With a new, modern fleet of bombers we possess the ability to destroy the enemy’s lifeline: Infrastructure, Industry, as well as morale."
NLR_heavy_fighters_f:0 "Heavy Fighter Models"
NLR_heavy_fighters_f_desc:0 "Using a heavier but sturdier frame and engine than their lighter counterparts, Heavy Fighters are able to fly longer distances and sustain more amounts of damage. This could, indeed, be a advantage to us."
NLR_paratroopers_f:0 "Shadowbolt Paratrooper Divisions"
NLR_paratroopers_f_desc:0 "The Shadowbolts are the elite aerial infantry of the Empress, and they have volunteered to form modern Airborne troops within the Army, aimed at ambushing the enemy from nowhere else but the sky itself."
NLR_rocketry:0 "Rocket Systems"
NLR_rocketry_desc:0 "Our recent advancements in aeronautics has brought plenty of our scientists’ attention to the field of rocketry. They believe that rocket engines might be the future, and it would be wise to see whether or not they are right."

NLR_reviw_military:0 "Review the Military"
NLR_reviw_military_desc:0 "The armed forces are essential to our survival. We must review the quality and performance of our ad hoc military to ensure we have the edge at all times."
NLR_army:0 "Soldiers of the Night"
NLR_army_desc:0 "Those who claim victory on land shall conquer. Strength on land!"
NLR_mobile_army:0 "Tempest Wind's Mobile Warfare"
NLR_mobile_army_desc:0 "General Tempest Wind is a staunch believer in mobile warfare, saying that quick movement and transport of troops and supplies will lead us to a swift and easy victory, in contrast to a long, drawn out war."
NLR_bat_experts:0 "Night Guard Expertise"
NLR_bat_experts_desc:0 "Batponies form the elite of our army, the very guard of our Empress herself. It would be best to spread their skill and knowledge to the rest of our troops."
NLR_weapons:0 "Modernised Equipment"
NLR_weapons_desc:0 "How can we even dare dream of victory if our troops are technologically inferior to our enemies? We must correct this mistake and equip our armies with modern guns and equipment."
NLR_research:0 "Military Research Committee"
NLR_research_desc:0 "With these incredible advancements in military technology, we should consider setting up a permanent research committee tasked with providing us new, modern weaponry."
NLR_magic_weapons:0 "The Luna Nova Rifle"
NLR_magic_weapons_desc:0 "A combination of magic and ballistic firearms, used by mages, is an interesting proposition worth exploring. If it works, we may have gained an upper hoof on the Loyalists."
NLR_mass_army_1:0 "Midnight Oil's Pony Wave"
NLR_mass_army_1_desc:0 "Midnight Oil, one of our Generals, has recommended a... different approach to modern warfare. He argues that a vast, reckless offensive could break the spine of any defensive line and, backed up with sufficient artillery, armour and, most importantly, infantry, could simply overwhelm enemy forces."
NLR_grand_army_1:0 "Speck's Classical Warfare"
NLR_grand_army_1_desc:0 "Field Marshal Speck follows the traditional military doctrine of Equestria, being that a vast, drawn-out battle-plan will first be established before any offensive is launched. This way, through extensive planning and plenty of preparation, casualties will be kept to a minimum, while success is ensured."
NLR_superior:0 "Selenite's Shock and Awe"
NLR_superior_desc:0 "Although quite young for such a title, General Selenite has developed and proposed a new strategy of warfare to us, mainly using the overwhelming superiority of firepower on the battlefield. She argues that by massing artillery fire, we could bring enemy forces to the breaking point, and then sweep in when they are weak, breaking the enemy lines."
NLR_race_tech_f:0 "Magical Development"
NLR_race_tech_f_desc:0 "Ponies, no matter if earth pony, pegasus, unicorn or even bat pony, are all different from one another, possessing strengths none of the other could hope to possess. We must ensure that we build on our strengths as much as possible."
NLR_magical_equipment_f:0 "Magi-Tech Anti-Armor Munitions"
NLR_magical_equipment_f_desc:0 "Since the very birth of ponykind, most sorts of magic were restricted to unicorns only, who were able to study, understand and possess great amounts of magical power. With the progress of science, we may however be able to use similar magical power for our anti-tank weaponary."
NLR_special_forces:0 "Lunar Special Forces Initiative"
NLR_special_forces_desc:0 "By recruiting and deploying our own batch of special forces, we may be able to adapt better to difficult military situations, which normal troops would be unable to overcome."
NLR_espirit_de_corps:0 "Esprit de Corps"

NLR_infantry_equipment_f:0 "New Rifles"
NLR_infantry_equipment_f_desc:0 "By using outdated equipment in our military, we are already putting ourselves at a massive disadvantage before our troops even clash with the enemy. We must make it our top-most priority to hoof out modern weapons to our troops."
NLR_motorized_equipment_f:0 "Infantry Mechanisation"
NLR_motorized_equipment_f_desc:0 "Using mobile regiments in the armed forces using the only recently invented "car" was suggested a few times, though not seen as a big possibility thus far. By using lightly armoured vehicles for transportation of troops, supplies and weapons, however, we can ensure maximum mobility and speed for our troops, making us quick and flexible on the battlefield."
NLR_light_tank_equipment_f:0 "Tank Development"
NLR_light_tank_equipment_f_desc:0 "The prospect of developing modern, capable tank models has been largely ignored thus far, but we shall ensure that the possible strength of a modern tank force is no longer ignored."
NLR_medium_tank_equipment_f:0 "Moving Fortresses"
NLR_medium_tank_equipment_f_desc:0 "Larger, stronger, more heavily armoured tank models shall be rolled out onto the field of battle, providing sufficient firepower to fight toe to toe against any foe it could encounter."
NLR_heavy_tank_equipment_f:0 "Project: Tempest's Box"
NLR_heavy_tank_equipment_f_desc:0 "General Tempest has found a great love for tanks, but claims that we have not gone far enough yet. To fully exploit the devastating firepower a tank can possess, we shall construct an even heavier tank model than before, which will be slow and yet ultimately more powerful in face to face combat. The enemy will either turn tail and flee or be devastated by this machine!"
NLR_batzkrieg_f:0 "Lightning Warfare"
NLR_batzkrieg_f_desc:0 "By combining our mechanised forces, Tank brigades and air force, we have become a fast, mobile and flexible fighting force, able to exploit small gaps in the enemy's line while reacting to breaches in our own very quickly. This "lightning warfare" will bring a quick end to our wars, unlike the classic drawn out wars of attrition."
NLR_support_equipment_f:0 "Support Brigades"
NLR_support_equipment_f_desc:0 "By deploying various different support brigades behind our troops, we can ensure maximum fighting efficiency."
NLR_radio_stations_f:0 "The FMH RADAR Network"
NLR_radio_stations_f_desc:0 "The newly developed RADAR technology will help us in detecting enemy troop movements and, more importantly, will aid us in detecting enemy air missions ahead of time, giving our pilots time to scramble and intercept."
NLR_artillery_equipment_f:0 "The Cowitzer"
NLR_artillery_equipment_f_desc:0 "Sometimes called the 'Queen of the Battlefield', Artillery was, and always will be the highest calibre on the battlefield. Using its devastating firepower and immense range, we are able to bombard enemy positions from far away."
NLR_rocket_artillery_equipment_f:0 "M8 Rocket Launchers"
NLR_rocket_artillery_equipment_f_desc:0 "Some scientists have approached us with a set of blueprints for a new contraption that they call "rocket launcher". In theory, it would be much lighter than a artillery piece, thus more mobile, while still possessing great destructive ability by firing large amounts of rockets towards the enemy."
NLR_nuclear_f:0 "The Power of the Atom"
NLR_nuclear_f_desc:0 "By harnessing the power of atoms, we may yet discover a weapon that vastly surpasses anyone's imagination on destructive capability. Some say that one of these weapons could destroy a city in a moment's notice. We shall see if this holds true."

NLR_navy:0 "Found the Lunar Navy"
NLR_navy_desc:0 "Those who rule the waves shall endure. Strength at sea!"
NLR_escorts:0 "Escort Effort"
NLR_escorts_desc:0 "Destroyers and Cruisers are the backbone of any Navy. We must ensure our models are up to date with today’s standards."
NLR_carriers:0 "Carrier Focus"
NLR_carriers_desc:0 "Battleships are nothing but target practice for planes, these days. Their days of glory are over, and the age of flight has taken their place. Carriers are the future!"
NLR_battleships:0 "Battleship Focus"
NLR_battleships_desc:0 "Battleships have ruled the seas for ages, the roaring of their guns sending shivers down their enemies’ spines. Battleships are the future!"
NLR_c_planes:0 "Naval Bombers"
NLR_c_planes_desc:0 "Aircraft Carriers require aircraft. We must ensure our planes are superior to those of our foes, or we risk losing more than we can build."
NLR_cruisers:0 "Heavy Cruisers"
NLR_cruisers_desc:0 "While Destroyers and light Cruisers are the backbone of any Navy, it is up to our heavier models to provide Battleships with the necessary fire support. Further research is mandatory if we wish for our Capital ships to survive."
NLR_more_carriers:0 "Advanced Carrier Models"
NLR_more_carriers_desc:0 "Our fleet and doctrine is coming along well, and yet there is still room for improvement. With the knowledge we’ve gained we can now unlock the true potential of our Carriers and their squadrons."

NLR_new_ships_desc:0 "It is time to truly assemble a grand fleet for ourselves, one that will cause the enemy to rout by its pure sight."
NLR_destroyers:0 "Patrol Boats"
NLR_destroyers_desc:0 "While battleships and carriers are nice and all, we need some smaller vessels to patrol the coasts and defend our ports."

lunas.5.a:0 "Truly."

lunas.6.t:0 "The South-East Intervention"
lunas.6.d:0 "Our garrison in south-eastern Equestria has been struggling for a long time now, with communist rebels rising up in Baltimare, natives rallying behind Doctor Caballeron and Celestial loyalists driving our forces out of Stableside. But so far Stars Whirl and her subordinates have performed admirably, holding the line long enough for us to defeat Celestia's primary forces. Now we can finally come to their aid and restore peace and order in the burning jungles."
lunas.6.a:0 "Onwards to victory!"

lunas.7.t:0 "An Exile From The Lunar Empire"
lunas.7.d:0 "Rumours have spread that the Lunar Empire is currently holding trials for captured generals from the opposing side. Princess Celestia's loyalists seem to receive little mercy and are either imprisoned or exiled. One such banished pony has now arrived in our country, offering us his services as an officer in the army. He swears loyalty to us and seems trustworthy enough."
lunas.7.a:0 "He can be useful to us."

lunas.9.t:0 "Lunar Volunteers"
lunas.9.d:0 "On a field used for playing buckball in peacetime, a large crowd had gathered, huddled together in the cold evening rain. Most of them were thestrals, but among them were earth ponies, pegasi and unicorns. All of them had a weapon of some sort; a rifle, a pistol, or something crude like a musket or even a pitchfork. The chatter among them stopped when a bat pony officer appeared and shouted "Attention!"\n\nOut of all the ponies on the field, he was the only one wearing a shiny new uniform. His duty was now that of an officer, and he would organize this rabble into a proper fighting unit.\n\n"Disciples of the Night! I am Lieutenant Silent Peaks. You have all come here to fight for equality between the four tribes, for the emancipation of the thestral race, and for the defence of our families against reprisals from Celestial loyalists. And it is a noble cause indeed, but a noble cause is not enough to make you good fighters. This is why you will be drilled, and I will turn you donkeys into a battalion worthy of our Empress. Discipline is needed if we wish to be victorious in this war, and discipline requires harshness. Think twice if you are ready for it, and for the horrors of battle. If not, then stop wasting my time and get out of my sight. The rest of you, step forth. We have prepared proper equipment for you, and lodgings for rest. Tomorrow the training will start. My task is to prepare you for the frontline as quickly as possible. It won't be easy for any of us, but by the end of it, you will resemble soldiers instead of angry peasants. Speaking of which, drop those damn pitchforks and come get actual weapons, you maggots!""
lunas.9.a:0 "Perhaps their skill will match their eagerness."

lunas.10.t:0 "Mission Briefing"
lunas.10.d:0 "Misty Night entered Lieutenant Silent Peak's tent and stood at attention. He was sitting behind her desk, reading reports on military operations in the sector. Next to the papers was a framed drawing of his daughter. Five minutes Misty Night stood, waiting patiently, until he finished reading and lifted his gaze. "Good, you didn't interrupt me. Now I am even more convinced you are the pony for the task."\n\nMisty Night nodded. "What is your command?"\n\n"I read from your background that you received training from fellow Disciples before taking part in several arms thefts as well as ambushes against Celestial loyalists before you volunteered to join the Lunar Army. I think you will be capable of fulfilling this task. The Empress has requested me to prepare ponies to escort a shipment of weapons to our fellow soldiers fighting against insurgents in the south-east. You will lead them and ensure you are not discovered by our enemies. Do you understand?"\n\n"Yes, sir."\n\n"Good. This mission is critical. Failure will be punished. Do not forget this."\n\n"I will not, sir. I would prefer death over failing my Goddess."\n\n"Death may well be your punishment. Now go and get your equipment. You will be leaving in an hour. The shipment is ready."\n\nShe bowed deeply, turned around and left. Silent glanced at the drawing on his desk.\n\n"I hope I can see her again soon," he mumbled quietly."
lunas.10.a:0 "Hopefully she will succeed."

lunas.11.t:0 "Our Capital"
lunas.11.d:0 "Our Empress can now decide where our capital should be located now. It is a choice between Canterlot, the capital of Equestria where Lunar symbols and monuments to civil war heroes are already replacing statues of Celestia; Manehattan, the hub of Luna's reform efforts and the most loyal supporter during the civil war; or the Castle of the Two Sisters, the ancient home of the monarchy where Luna and Celestia once lived together, and where our Empress fatefully turned into Nightmare Moon and tried to usurp her sister."
lunas.11.a:0 "Canterlot."
lunas.11.b:0 "Manehattan."
lunas.11.c:0 "Castle of the Two Sisters."

lunas.12.t:0 "The Fate Of [CRY.GetNameDef]"
lunas.12.d:0 "Beyond the northern border of the Lunar Empire lies another Empire of the crystal ponies. While they did not actively oppose us during the civil war, it is questionable if we can truly trust [CRY.GetLeader]. They might harbour sympathies for Celestia and her followers and could be plotting against us at this very moment. [CRY.GetNameDef] has barely any thestrals living in it, so why would they care for their plight?\n\nSomething must be done to ensure the safety of the northern frontier. The Empress' advisors have proposed two actions, one of which must be chosen. Either a swift military offensive needs to bring the crystal ponies under direct Imperial rule, or more peacefully, an envoy will be sent, asking them to become our loyal subjects. Of course, [CRY.GetLeader] might not be happy to bend the knee, but it is not like they have a choice. The Empress, however, does, and now she must decide before it is too late."
lunas.12.a:0 "Crush them swiftly."
lunas.12.b:0 "We shall demand their subservience!"
lunas.12.c:0 "Perhaps I should ask a friend for help..."

lunas.13.t:0 "The End of Civil War"
lunas.13.d:0 "[GetMonth], [GetYear]. The war is over and we are victorious. The last holdouts of the Equestrian Army have capitulated and Celestia herself has been captured. While pockets of resistance remain, they are scattered and disorganized. Our Empress is now preparing a ceremony in Canterlot where she will officially succeed her sister as the sole monarch Equestria, now known as the Lunar Empire. The time has come to rebuild and mend our wounds before our enemies take advantage of our weakness and war exhaustion."
lunas.13.a:0 "Long live the Empress!"

lunas.15.t:0 "An Ultimatum From [From.Capital.GetName]"
lunas.15.d:0 "Today an envoy escorted by armed thestrals arrived in [Root.Capital.GetName]. She personally delivered a message from the Empress of the Lunar Empire herself to [Root.GetLeader]. It was very succinct, and its main demand was clear: Bend the knee or be destroyed.\n\nThe Empress wishes to eventually send a governor to ensure our everlasting loyalty to her, which would most likely endanger our sovereignty. However, if we refuse, we will be considered traitors who will receive swift justice from the Lunar Army. [CRY.GetLeader] should consider their response carefully, for the fate of our nation hangs by a very thin thread."
lunas.15.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept..."
lunas.15.b:0 "This is outrageous! We're allies, not servants!"

lunas.16.t:0 "The Crystal Empire Defiant"
lunas.16.d:0 "The envoy we sent to [From.Capital.GetName] has returned with her armed escort. The ultimatum she delivered in person to [From.GetLeader] was brashly refused, and [From.GetName] refuses to recognize us as their rightful overlords. Now they have revealed their true face as traitors and worshippers of Celestia! The Empress must deal with them swiftly and most ruthlessly."
lunas.16.a:0 "This means war!"

lunas.18.t:0 "Visiting A Friend"
lunas.18.d:0 ""It is, uhm, rather quaint that you wished to enjoy a cup of tea with me, but... I suspect you want something more."\nRarity looked at Nightmare Moon with a frown as she poured hot tea into her cup.\nThe Empress nodded. "Ah, yes, some biscuits, please."\nThe unicorn scoffed at her response and rolled her eyes. "You know precisely what I mean."\nNightmare Moon levitated the cup and blew into the steaming liquid. Rarity glared at her. Slowly, the cup rose, and the Empress sipped.\n"Mm, delicious. Now where are those biscuits?"\n"Uuugh, fine, you can have your accursed confection." She turned around to get a box of sweets.\n"Thank you. And yes, I need you for a very special task, Rarity. One that I can entrust on nopony else."\nShe sighed and gave the box to the Empress. "Goodness gracious, finally. Did you really need both tea and biscuits before you could tell me that?"\n"Why, yes. Manners, Rarity. We shouldn't rush into chatting before properly starting our teatime." She smirked smugly.\n"Oh yes. Of course. How very rude of me," Rarity mumbled in a monotone voice. "Now if you may excuse me for so impolitely inquiring directly, what task do you need me for?" she asked in an exaggeratedly mannered voice.\n"I need you visit [CRY.GetLeader], ask them to become our subjects, and to eventually govern the Crystal Empire in my name. That's all."\nRarity blinked twice, then fainted.\n"I'll take that as a yes," the Empress said and sipped some more tea."
lunas.18.a:0 "I trust she will perform well."

lunas.19.t:0 "The Loyalist Trials"
lunas.19.d:0 "Celestia has been banished, but we've managed to capture most of the loyalist generals and leaders. They demand fair trials, and if we would not grant them, it would likely cause unrest. To prove to everypony that our Empress is fair, just and wise, their wish shall be granted and they will be brought before her to be judged. Perhaps they can gain retribution -- or eternal damnation for their misguided resistance against Lunar rule."
lunas.19.a:0 "This would be so much easier if we could just shoot them."

lunas.20.t:0 "The Trial of Commander Fast Clip"
lunas.20.d:0 "Commander Fast Clip, a drill sergeant in the Wonderbolts and Captain Spitfire's second in command. Many of his duties were administrative and he helped with organizing the Equestrian military during the civil war. Out of all the generals on trial he's the least controversial, but he has always been a bit of a shifty sort and could perhaps be convinced to join our officer corps. Alternatively, we can simply imprison him for treason."
lunas.20.a:0 "Throw him in a dungeon."
lunas.20.b:0 "Make him an offer."

lunas.21.t:0 "The Trial of Commander Whiplash"
lunas.21.d:0 "Commander Whiplash is another Wonderbolts drill instructor alongside Fast Clip. While he isn't particularly famous, he isn't unknown either, meaning ponies are interested in what conviction he receives. Thankfully our finest lawyers have already managed to pin several wartime crimes against him, and of course the standard charge of treason. However his "crimes" are not nearly enough to warrant an execution, thus we must choose whether to exile him or imprison him."
lunas.21.a:0 "Imprision him."
lunas.21.b:0 "Exile him."

lunas.22.t:0 "The Trial of Commander Soarin"
lunas.22.d:0 "Commander Soarin is, to say the least, one of the most popular commanders in the Loyalists' army, mostly because of his fame as a Wonderbolt. However, he has declined any and all offers we've made him in an effort to convince him to join us. Thus leaving us in a position in which no matter what we do it will upset someone. We can either put him in prison for the rest of his life, or we can banish him to a distant country."
lunas.22.a:0 "Imprision him and throw away the key."
lunas.22.b:0 "Exile him to Yakyakistan."

lunas.23.t:0 "The Trial of Prince Blueblood"
lunas.23.d:0 "The Blueblood that lived before the Civil War might as well be a completely different pony from the stallion standing in front of her majesty's throne today. The responsibility and the stress of the situation has made him into a sight to behold. No longer a whimpering coward, Blueblood is now a hardened commander and war hero, but most importantly her majesty's nephew...\n\nDespite repeated attempts to convince him to join the Lunar Empire he has remained steadfast, thus leaving us with little choice. We must either put him under closely guarded house arrest, or exile him."
lunas.23.a:0 "Put him under house arrest."
lunas.23.b:0 "Exile him..."

lunas.24.t:0 "The Trials are Over"
lunas.24.d:0 "With Prince Blueblood's trial over, the so called "Celestial Trials" are finally finished, and the figureheads of resistance have been dealt with. The Empress is now seen as a just ruler who doesn't simply shoot those who oppose her. With her reputation somewhat improved, we can now focus on reinforcing her rule across the nation."
lunas.24.a:0 "Back to business."

lunas.25.t:0 "Lunar Terror"
lunas.25.d:0 "Your majesty, it has come to our attention that many different parts of our military are showing deep resentment and hatred for the enemy. While this isn’t a bad thing, per se, it carries with it the side effect of increasingly frequent hate crimes against not only prisoners of war but also civilians that now fall under our occupation. The longer the war drags on, the more bitter the troops become, and with their bitterness the crime rate increases."
lunas.25.a:0 "War never changes. Press forward."

lunas.26.t:0 "Crystal Night Alliance"
lunas.26.d:0 "King Sombra of the Crystal Empire has sent an official communique to Empress Nightmare Moon and the Lunar Imperial General Staff inviting the Lunar Empire into his Gray Pact alliance. The statement not only includes the promise of military aid in fighting the, quote, 'meddling forces of the Light,' unquote, but also promises for a further expansion later on should the relationship prove profitable. While some voice displeasure at the possibility of aligning ourselves with such an upstart there are others who see promise in the repeatedly resurrected monarch. Regardless of what they think though, they will all toe the line when the Empress indicates which side of the debate she's on."
lunas.26.a:0 "We shall join the Gray Pact."
lunas.26.b:0 "We shall dispose of this so-called king in due time."

lunas.27.t:0 "King Sombra Proposes to Nightmare Moon"
lunas.27.d:0 "At our headquarters today arrived a letter addressed to the Queen of the Night herself from King Sombra of the Crystal Empire. It was a love letter, and a proposal. Sombra laid out his feelings for all to see, and spoke very highly of Nightmare Moon and her nation. It seems that he wants to marry her, and in so doing create an alliance to shake the world. However, some aides remind Her Majesty of the rumors that Sombra once courted Celestia, and they ask if she really wants to risk ending up with her sister's leftovers." 
lunas.27.a:0 "Rumor and fantasy! Sombra will make a fine husband."

However, changing its name back to how it was before the Winter Revolution is also out of the question. Princessyn makes ponies think of Celestia, and there are no princesses in Equestria anyways, only an Empress. The populace of the city will not react to the name change happily as they cling on to their foolish revolutionary ideas. Perhaps it would be best to punish them by demolishing the city entirely and deporting its population to the surrounding countryside. While extreme, this would effectively quell any thoughts of resistance.\n\nWhat shall the fate of the city be, your majesty?"

Regarded as a center of the modern arts before the war, the Lunar Government is doing its best to help the theatrical arts reclaim their title. Today across the Empire, one of the major studios, Warner Colts Pictures, put out a large scale advertisement campaign, looking to hire new actors, writers, and film staff, in preparation for a grand re-opening next year. Already, one of the studio’s directors, Moon Flower, has announced a film she plans on creating, based on exploits of a heroic squad of bat ponies and Manehattan idealists during the civil war, who began at each other’s throats, but by war’s end were one of the finest teams of soldiers serving the Empire. "I plan on staying as faithful as possible to the original source material," Flower went on record to say, "so I have been in constant and frequent contact with the surviving members of the squad. All in all, I cannot wait to see this dream become reality, and for a new era of film to be a part of our corner of the world moving forward.""

lunas.40.d:0 ""The civil war is over and the cursed Celestial loyalists have been defeated! Now, my children, let us commence with rebuilding our nation, and let us secure our Empire from the vile influence of the traitors! All shall bow before the Night!"\n\nNightmare Moon's speech echoed from the balcony of her palace in [Root.Capital.GetName]. Her booming royal voice was loud enough to be heard clearly all across the city. It was so loud that many cowered and covered their ears in fear as windows shook. To all, it was a clear sign that this Empress would not be as kind and benevolent as her sister had been. No, this Empress would suffer no dissent, and would assert her dominance on all her subjects."
lunas.40.a:0 ""They shall learn to love and fear me!""

lunas.41.t:0 "Daytime Curfews"
lunas.41.d:0 "With the Celestial loyalists defeated and Celestia out of our way, there is no need to praise the once revered day anymore. Instead, our subjects shall be restricted from going out at daytime, in order to make them see the glory of the night. Too long have they slept and ignored the beauty of night, the glittering stars and the shining Moon. For the first time in history, and rightfully so, the day shall be ignored, and the night praised instead. Non-thestrals will have to adapt to sleeping during the day and working during the night. Those who leave their homes during day and expose themselves to the searing sun without permission will be punished accordingly."

lunas.42.t:0 "One Sister, One God, One Nation!"
lunas.42.d:0 "The Lunar Empire needs only one ruler. Any traces of the former diarchy, and the thousand-year-long Celestial rule that preceded it, shall be eradicated. In fact, Nightmare Moon never had a sister. No, she is the sole Princess and Empress, and only she can be treated with reverence. Old sayings such as "Sweet Celestia" can no longer be used. She was a flawed and foolish figure, a weakling and an oppressor of thestrals. She deserves nothing but contempt. Nightmare Moon on the other hoof demands worship and praise, for she now raises the Moon and lowers the Sun, and she is the master of all Equestrians. Regional autonomy of Celestia's reign will be gone, replaced with direct rule from [Root.Capital.GetName]."
lunas.42.a:0 "Take that, Sister!"

lunas.43.d:0 "The day has come.\n\nToday, in the ruined court of Canterlot Castle, the old capital of the vile Princess of the Sun, the last batch of loyalist traitors was presented to the crowd which had gathered there for the 'event'. The IIS had worked hard to ensure that they found every single last traitor in the Empire, and they had concluded that those were the very last bunch of them.\n\nThe crowd cheered as the Empress herself made an appearance, speaking to them. Then, the Empress turned and watched as her Night Guard approached the blindfolded prisoners. The crowd held its breath.\n\n"Ready! Aim! FIRE!"\n\nThe gunshots echoed through the city, and the crowd cheered as the bodies collapsed to the floor.\n\nSilent Peaks, one of the soldiers spectating, closed his eyes and lowered his head. It's as he feared. The Nightmare Moon of old has truly returned, and any chance of reconciliation between lunarists and Celestial loyalists was now gone for good."

It will also work hard to glorify the Empire and the Empress while smearing our enemies, such as Celestial loyalists and changeling scum. Propaganda will be on the radio, on the newspapers, and on posters plastered in the streets. This way, our citizens may never forget about the cause - fighting for the night!"

lunas.45.d:0 "The Civil War has come to an end, and it has left behind a Equestria more divided and devastasted than ever before. Cities destroyed, families torn apart and the nation itself divided more than ever.\n\nTo combat these problems, and to heal the nation and her subjects, Empress Nightmare Moon wishes to rely on compassion and forgiveness to sway old enemies back to her side, and rebuild Equestria to what it once was. Her reformation by the Elements of Harmony changed her and she is not like she once was, over a thousand years ago. The Celestial loyalists expect her to be a monster, but she will show them that she can be as kind as her older sister."

lunas.46.d:0 "During the civil war, many loyalists were captured and imprisoned for their political beliefs. They were treated dreadfully, barely able to sustain themselves in their dark cells. Now, the Empress has called for them to be released immediately, saying that we mustn't infringe upon the basic principles of liberty and freedom.\n\nThe prisoners were shocked when they heard the news and struggled the believe it was true. Then joy overcame them as they were set free from their cells and allowed to return back to civilian life, all charges against them dropped and their past deeds forgiven.

They were proven wrong, however, as Nightmare Moon released them in good spirit. The Empress says that their freedom and safety is in the best interest of both them and Equestria as a whole, given their actions in defending Equestria from evil many times in the past.\n\nThe six ponies, though still on guard, were given train tickets back to their hometown and left the capital via train a few hours ago."

Like last year, ponies all across the Empire, including the batponies, gathered around in public to enjoy some precious, fun times with one another. What was intended to merge batpony and pony society with one another seems to be fullfilling its purpose perfectly, and everypony involved says they can't wait for next year's celebrations, even if they still have a headache after all the apple cider they drank that night."

lunas.54.t:0 "Thestral Friendship Day"
lunas.54.d:0 "Though it was initially an awkward experience for both sides, the new Thestral Friendship Day seems to now be a new day of interest for both batponies and other ponies. Though they were originally, for millenia, segregated and in a silent rivalry with one another, the rift between the Thestrals and other ponies seems to be shrinking more and more with each year, and the Thestral Friendship Day surely plays a big part in it. All over the Empire, old rivalries are being left behind in favour of friendship and forgiveness. While some ponies still hold onto their old grudges, more ponies and bats than ever before engaged in friendly activities and, naturally, also the traditional hugging. We have high hopes that next year, the celebrations and friendly spirit of this holiday will grow even further!"

Rarity said, barely looking up from her work.\n\nNightmare Moon sighed, "The war is over, Rarity."\n\nRarity flinched, levitating a box towards Nightmare Moon. "YOUR war. Have you seen my latest line? My customers were overjoyed."\n\nNightmare Moon looked suspiciously "These are old, soiled clothes! I have no patience for your jests."\n\nRarity turned, finally meeting her gaze. "For the war orphans."\n\nNightmare Moon warred, fury and sorrow battling for control. "And what of the thestrals who suffered for centuries and Celestia's unwillingness to help? Justice has been done, and we must move forward." Her voice softened "Rarity, you may not agree with my methods, but what about Friendship? What about the good of Equestria? The thestrals are free but we are a nation divided. We need symbols. Respected ponies, hooves in both old Equestria and the New Lunar Empire. We need you."\n\n"Friendship? You killed my friend and you speak of friendship?!"\n\nNightmare Moon grew angry, "She is no more dead than I was when Luna ruled! Watch!" Her face rippled, her catlike pupils rounding, her mane lightening. "I'm sorry Rarity. I... We... need you. This is not the Nightmare Moon of old. We rule together. Help me temper her strength and will with your kindness and generosity."\n\nRarity stared as Luna faded, tears streaming down her face. "I...I will.""

lunas.56.d:0 "Numerous magnates, CEOs, managers, bosses and so on were brought before the Empress. Once, they had worn fancy clothing befitting of their high-ranking positions, but now they were stripped bare and made to kneel before their mistress. Yet their mistress was not necessarily a cruel one, especially when she could benefit from benevolence. While they had aided her treacherous older sibling during the war, perhaps they could yet be redeemed. The companies they owned employed many talented workers and owned many facilities, after all, which could benefit the Lunar Empire greatly.\n\nOf course, on the other hoof the companies could simply be dissolved and their assets confiscated, and the industrialists themselves thrown into the deepest dungeons, but without the skill and experience of the concerns their facilities couldn't be utilized to their full potential.\n\nWhat is the Empress' decision?"
lunas.56.a:0 "Let them be of some use to us."

lunas.17.t:0 "Opening up a Second Front"
lunas.17.d:0 "For the last couple of months General Speck and General Midnight Blossom have been hard at work trying to pitch their plans to open up a second front againist the Loyalists. General Speck has proposed that we use the Los Pegasus crime familes and their support to our advantage and launch an attack on Los Pegasus, while General Blossom has proposed we sneak our troops trough the Crystal Mountains and into Whinny to attack the Loyalists from behind, and hopefulyl cut off their contact with the Crystal Empire."
lunas.17.a:0 "An attack on Los Pegasus will break the Loyalists"
lunas.17.b:0 "Taking Whinny will break Equestria's spine"
lunas.17.c:0 "Scrap both of the plans, those ponies will be put to better use elsewhere"
lunas.19.t:0 "The Loyalist Trials"
lunas.19.d:0 "Celestia has been banished, but we've managed to capture most of the Loyalist generals and leaders, we could just execute them and be done with it, but unfortunately that might break the tenuous control we have over the country. So we have no other choice than to put them on trial."
lunas.19.a:0 "This would be so much easier if we could just shoot them."
lunas.20.t:0 "The Trial of Commander Fastclip"
lunas.20.d:0 "Commander Fastclip once a drill sergeant in the Wonderbolts had been steadily rising trough Equestria's ranks for years and has only recently become one of their generals. Unfortunately for him he became a commander right before our glorious rebellion. Out of all the generals on trial he's the least controvesial so it would be easy to just shoot him and be done with it, however he has always been a bit of a shifty bugger and could perhaps be convinced to join our officer corps."
lunas.20.a:0 "Shoot him"
lunas.20.b:0 "Make him an offer"
lunas.21.t:0 "The Trial of Commander Whiplash"
lunas.21.d:0 "Commander Whiplash a retired Wonderbolt who has been serving as one of Equestria's most distinguished generals for a rather long time now. While he isn't particularly famous he isn't unknown either, thankfully our finest lawyers have already managed to pin several wartime crimes againist him, and of course the standard charge of treason. However his "crimes" are not nearly enough to warrant an execution, thus we must choose wether to exile him or imprision him."
lunas.21.a:0 "Imprision him"
lunas.21.b:0 "Exile him"
lunas.22.t:0 "The Trial of Commander Soarin"
lunas.22.d:0 "Commander Soarin is to say the least one of the most popular commanders in the Loyalists' army, mostly because of his popularity as a Wonderbolt. However he has declined any and all offeres we've made him in an effort to convince him to join us. Thus leaving us in a position in which no matter what we do it will upset someone."
lunas.22.a:0 "Popular or not, hang him up high"
lunas.22.b:0 "Exile him to Yakyakistan"
lunas.22.c:0 "Imprision him and throw away the key"
lunas.23.t:0 "The Trial of Prince Blueblood"
lunas.23.d:0 "The Blueblood that lived before the Civil War might as well be a completely different pony from the stallion standing in front of her majesty's throne today. The responsibility and the stress of the situation have made him into a sight to behold, no longer a whimpering coward the Blueblood standing before us today is a hardened commander and war hero, but most importantly her majesty's nephew... Despite repeated attempts to convince him to join the Lunar Empire he has remained steadfast, thus leaving us with little choice... We must either execute him or exile him."
lunas.23.a:0 "Exile him..."
lunas.23.b:0 "Shoot him, family or not he is still a traitor"
lunas.24.t:0 "The Trials are Over"
lunas.24.d:0 "With Blueblood's trial the so called "Celestial Trials" are finally finished, now we can focus on reinforcing our rule."
lunas.24.a:0 "Back to business"
lunas.25.t:0 "Lunar Terror"
lunas.25.d:0 "Your majesty, it has come to our attention that many different parts of our military are showing deep resentment and hatred for the enemy. While this isn’t a bad thing, per se, it carries with it the side effect of increasingly frequent hate crimes against not only prisoners of war but also civilians that now fall under our occupation. The longer the war drags on, the more bitter the troops become, and with their bitterness the crime rate increases."
lunas.25.a:0 "War is war"
lunas.28.t:0 "The Situation Down South"
lunas.28.d:0 "It seems that against all odds our few remaining loyal soldiers in the South-East have managed to secure it for our glorious empire! While these are joyous news, perhaps we should consider rewarding Commander Stars Whirl with more autonomy for her actions?"
lunas.28.a:0 "Appoint Commander Stars Whirl as the Governor-General of the South-East"
lunas.28.b:0 "They've fullfiled their purpose, integrate them into the Empire."
lunas.29.t:0 "The Capital."
lunas.29.d:0 "As we control most of the Equestria, we need to set our capital in one of the major cities. Or should we keep it down south where it's safest?"
lunas.29.a:0 "Canterlot, the Equestrian Heart."
lunas.29.b:0 "Manehattan, the largest city!"
lunas.29.c:0 "Fillydelphia, the known port!"
lunas.29.e:0 "Baltimare, a chill place."
lunas.29.f:0 "Stableside, it's safe."
lunas.31.t:0 "New name of Stalliongrad"
lunas.31.d:0 "We need to erase all mentions of Stalliongrad as a city for this catastrophe not to repeat in the future."
lunas.31.a:0 "Rename it to Lunargrad."
lunas.31.c:0 "Rename it to Colitsyn."
lunas.31.f:0 "Demolish the city entirely."
lunas.31.b:0 "We don't need to."
lunas.34.t:0 "Bat Appreciation Day"
lunas.34.d:0 "Today marks the inception of the newly christened “Batpony Appreciation Day”, a new national holiday as proclaimed by our Empress Nightmare Moon. In honor of the Valiant efforts made by Batponies serving in our armed forces, today has been set aside as a day of peace, to honor those who fell for our safety. For today, we all stand proud by our leathery-winged brothers and sisters, honored that such ponies are fighting on our behalf, to keep us safe from harm and trouble."
lunas.34.a:0 "Let’s go hug a bat!"
lunas.35.t:0 "Movies, Movies, Movies!"
lunas.35.d:0 "As part of the country’s reconstruction efforts,  today the Lunar Government was proud to announce the re-opening of the Film Studios in Las Pegasus, on the west coast of the Empire. Regarded as a center of the modern arts before the war, the Lunar Government is doing its best to help the Theatrical arts reclaim their title. Today across the Empire, one of the major studios, Warner Colts Pictures, put out a large scale advertisement campaign, looking to hire new actors, writers, and film staff, in preparation for a grand  re-opening next year. Already, one of the Studio’s directors, one Moon Flower, has announced a film she plans on creating, based on exploits of a heroic squad of bat ponies and loyalist turncoats during the civil war, who began at each other’s throats, but by war’s end were one of the finest teams of soldiers serving the Empire. “I plan on staying as faithful as possible to the original source material,” Flower went on record to say, “so I have been in constant and frequent contact with the surviving members of the squad. All in all, I cannot wait to see this dream become reality, and for a new era of film to be a part of our corner of the world moving forward."
lunas.35.a:0 "Another reason to go to the movies again!"

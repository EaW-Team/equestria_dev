### Ideas ###
NLR_moonshine_weaponstealers_3:0 "Hidden Supply Depots"
NLR_moonshine_weaponstealers_3_desc:0 "Thanks to Luna's machinations, we were able to make repeated daring raids on Equestrian supplies, even as they tried to stop us in vain. Much of Equestria's military supplies are now hidden in a network of depots across the nation, ready to be utilised for the Empress."
NLR_moonshine_weaponstealers_2:0 "Hidden Weapons Caches"
NLR_moonshine_weaponstealers_2_desc:0 "We made several daring raids to steal Equestrian equipment, followed by raids on older, less guarded equipment. As a result our troops are supported by a hidden network of weapons caches."
NLR_moonshine_weaponstealers_1:0 "Minor Hidden Weapons Caches"
NLR_moonshine_weaponstealers_1_desc:0 "We initially made several daring raids to steal Equestrian equipment, but quickly moved to more cautious methods. As a result we have small but helpful collection of supply caches to assist in supporting our troops."
NLR_moonshine_weaponstealers_0:0 "Stolen Weapons Confiscated"
NLR_moonshine_weaponstealers_0_desc:0 "With the discovery of Nightmare Moon's plot, the Equestrian army moved quickly to recover many missing weapons shipments. Our stolen weapons have been retaken, and we are now attempting to execute battleplans that expected supplies we do not possess anymore."
NLR_moonshine_workers_3:0 "Assiduous Workers"
NLR_moonshine_workers_3_desc:0 "Luna's hard work in campaigning for civil rights established a strong grassroots presence among the workers on the east coast. Production is good and many strongly believe our official narrative about the war, hoping to help "Luna" save Celestia by banishing "Daybreaker"."
NLR_moonshine_workers_2:0 "Supportive Workers"
NLR_moonshine_workers_2_desc:0 "Luna's work in campaigning for civil rights established a grassroots presence among the workers on the east coast. Production is above average and most accept our official narrative about the war, hoping to help "Luna" save Celestia by banishing "Daybreaker"."
NLR_moonshine_workers_1:0 "Confused Workers"
NLR_moonshine_workers_1_desc:0 "Although Luna campaigned effectively on the east coast generating strong support, her weak minded focus on friendship and kindness left many workers confused and unsure how this war reflects those values. Fortunately "Luna"'s true identity remains only a whispered rumour and production continues mostly unchanged."
NLR_moonshine_workers_0:0 "Disloyal Workers"
NLR_moonshine_workers_0_desc:0 "With the prior discovery of Nightmare Moon's plot, some workers openly discuss their suspicions of "Luna"'s true identity and question the claims of Celestia's evil. Production suffers as a result."
NLR_moonshine_bats_3:0 "Full Thestral Mobilisation"
NLR_moonshine_bats_3_desc:0 "The thestral forces were fully committed to a possible military conflict and are contributing well to the civil war. This is what they've been preparing for centuries."
NLR_moonshine_bats_2:0 "Partial Thestral Readiness"
NLR_moonshine_bats_2_desc:0 "The thestral forces were partially mobilised when war broke out. They are contributing to the civil war."
NLR_moonshine_bats_1:0 "Unprepared Thestral Forces"
NLR_moonshine_bats_1_desc:0 "Thestral planning for any conflict was mostly limited to defensive and isolationist plans. The national nature of the civil war has taken them off guard and their contibution to the war effort is lacking."
NLR_moonshine_bats_0:0 "Isolated Thestral Forces"
NLR_moonshine_bats_0_desc:0 "With the discovery of Nightmare Moon's plot, Equestrian forces moved to prepare for any conflict with the batpony mountain holds, leaving us at a disadvantage. Our communication with them is poor and they are suffering defections."

NLR_fragile_rule_1:0 "Celestial Resistance"
NLR_fragile_rule_1_desc:0 "Not all have readily accepted our official story regarding the uprising. Unwilling to accept anypony but Celestia as their ruler, many ponies are openly disobedient and cause disarray at the home front. Most work alone, but more and more are gathering in organised groups, making tactical sabotages where we are weakest."
NLR_fragile_rule_2:0 "Celestial Resistance"
NLR_fragile_rule_2_desc:0 "Not all have readily accepted our official story regarding the uprising. Unwilling to accept anypony but Celestia as their ruler, many ponies are openly disobedient and cause disarray at the home front. Most work alone, but more and more are gathering in organised groups, making tactical sabotages where we are weakest."
NLR_fragile_rule_3:0 "Celestial Resistance"
NLR_fragile_rule_3_desc:0 "Not all have readily accepted our official story regarding the uprising. Unwilling to accept anypony but Celestia as their ruler, many ponies are openly disobedient and cause disarray at the home front. Most work alone, but more and more are gathering in organised groups, making tactical sabotages where we are weakest.\n\nHowever, recent efforts have culled their numbers, and it won't be long before their actions become irrelevant in the grand scheme of things."
NLR_war_plan:0 "Imperial War Plan"
NLR_war_plan_desc:0 "Wars cannot be won solely by promises and grand battles. The populace itself must be rallied to support the troops in the field by working extended hours, sacrificing unnecessary luxuries and pledging their resources to support the war effort. It is hardly a popular measure, but difficult times require difficult solutions."
NLR_fractured_society:0 "Fractured Society"
NLR_fractured_society_desc:0 "Like day and night, Equestrian ponies are divided across sharp, entrenched lines. Considerable effort will be required to restore national unity under the one Empress."
NLR_fractured_society_2:0 "An Uncertain Future"
NLR_fractured_society_2_desc:0 "Like day and night, Equestrian ponies are divided across sharp, entrenched lines. Considerable effort will be required to restore national unity under the one Empress.\n\nProgress has been made in reconciliation, but few ponies are certain whether the new rule will last for long."
NLR_lunar_mining_company_idea:0 "IM&DS"
NLR_lunar_mining_company_idea_desc:0 "Centralised management of mineral resources, ore reserves and oil deposits is ensuring more wealth is extracted from the ground, with less wastage by the industrial process. Profits are rising and the nationalised companies are operating at a healthy positive."
NLR_industrial_powerhouse_idea:0 "An Economic Powerhouse"
NLR_industrial_powerhouse_idea_desc:0 "Reconstructing the former economy into one suited more for the needs of a rising power has generated surpluses in production and wealth. The standard of living is slowly returnining to the state before the war."
NLR_secure_the_banks_idea:0 "IBS"
NLR_secure_the_banks_idea_desc:0 "Banking is commonly associated with the odious, unpleasant griffons, but few can deny the usefulness of having loans available at any time, not to mention vaults where ponies store their savings. A centralised banking organisation is sorely needed to breathe in new life to the Equestrian economy."
NLR_radio_equestria_idea:0 "Radio Nox"
NLR_radio_equestria_idea_desc:0 "Technology has allowed propaganda to spread further and wider. Previously restricted to newspapers and artwork, the radio allows information to be spread much more efficiently. Ponies will think twice before disregarding the caster's charming voice."
NLR_steel_milling_idea:0 "A Hundred Little Things"
NLR_steel_milling_idea_desc:0 "Ponies by nature desire to own possessions, yet the recent events left their fortunes low. Without petty items to distract their daily lives with, they grow ever so slowly to dislike the new rule. A focus on producing vast amounts of various consumer goods shall sate their needs for the time being."
NLR_academic_militarism_idea:0 "Militarised Academia"
NLR_academic_militarism_idea_desc:0 "Although friendship is still the guiding word for most ponies, it has become clear for most that certain ideals have to be put aside to suit the overarching changes in Equestria. "Make war for friendship" seems to be common thought for many these days."
NLR_longer_range_idea:0 "Long Range Bomber Operations"
NLR_longer_range_idea_desc:0 "New technologies are constantly updating themselves, leaving their usage to remain slightly unclear as the need for them is changing, as well.\n\nAircrafts have allowed ponies to travel distances in a shorter time span than previously seen, barring exceptionally talented mages skilled in teleportation, yet their fuel efficiency is horrendous. Certain airplane designs are being modified to travel longer distances on the same amount of gasoline."
NLR_bigger_payloads_idea:0 "Calibrated Bomber Payloads"
NLR_bigger_payloads_idea_desc:0 "New technologies are constantly updating themselves, leaving their usage to remain slightly unclear as the need for them is changing, as well.\n\nAircrafts have allowed ponies to transport goods farther and easier than before, yet there is always a need to expand cargo holds. Certain airplane designs are being modified to carry larger tonnage on the same amount of gasoline, which serves the current doctrinal thought."
NLR_legacy_of_the_legions_idea:0 "Legionary Traditions"
NLR_legacy_of_the_legions_idea_desc:0 "During the short First Uprising, the Nightmare Legions have developed their own unique practices, which is emulated today in the Lunar Army as their heritage. Morale among troops is rising, as the ponies are convinced they are fighting for something far greater than themselves."
NLR_lunar_continental_command_idea:0 "Imperial Continental Command"
NLR_lunar_continental_command_idea_desc:0 "The chaos of the civil war has left many operational and strategic concerns unanswered, due to the pressing need for triumph. Now that the Empress' rule is uncontested, She has approved of a dedicated command structure to manage all aspects of warfare on every level."
NLR_the_logistics_corps_idea:0 "Lunar Logistics Department"
NLR_the_logistics_corps_idea_desc:0 "The vast size of Equestria has necessitated the formation of a dedicated, professional corps tasked to handle all matters of logistics. No matter how remote of a location they are in, soldiers shall not lack neither supplies or sustenance."
NLR_airdropped_supplies_idea:0 "Lunar Logistics Department"
NLR_airdropped_supplies_idea_desc:0 "The vast size of Equestria has necessitated the formation of a dedicated, professional corps tasked to handle all matters of logistics. No matter how remote of a location they are in, soldiers shall not lack neither supplies or sustenance, further helped by the introduction of aircraft for the duty."
NLR_mass_mobilisation_idea:0 "Legionary Traditions"
NLR_mass_mobilisation_idea_desc:0 "During the short First Uprising, the Nightmare Legions have developed their own unique practices, which is emulated today in the Lunar Army as their heritage. Morale among troops is rising, as the ponies are convinced they are fighting for something far greater than themselves, with more and more recruits joining to serve the Empress."
NLR_special_warfare_department_idea:0 "Imperial Continental Command"
NLR_special_warfare_department_idea_desc:0 "The chaos of the civil war has left many operational and strategic concerns unanswered, due to the pressing need for triumph. Now that the Empress' rule is uncontested, She has approved of a dedicated command structure to manage all aspects of warfare on every level."
NLR_quantity_over_quality_idea:0 "Quantity Over Quality"
NLR_quantity_over_quality_idea_desc:0 "Recent doctrinal advances have necessitated the need for having a steady stockpile of armoured vehicles in reserve to quickly replace ones destroyed in the field. As such, factory guidelines have been updated to conserve more resources, while producing a larger amount of vehicles of acceptable quality."
NLR_quality_over_quantity_idea:0 "Quality Over Quantity"
NLR_quality_over_quantity_idea_desc:0 "Although recent doctrinal advances have necessitated the need for having a steady stockpile of armoured vehicles in reserve to quickly replace ones destroyed in the field, it was decided against cutting costs in tank production. Instead, focus has been placed on increasing their reliability so that they may last for as long as possible instead."
NLR_admiralty:0 "Lunar Admiralty"
NLR_admiralty_desc:0 "The remainders of the Equestrian fleet and its ponypower have been reorganised to suits the Empress' desires for a large and powerful naval force to protect the shores and coastlines."
NLR_admiralty2:0 "Modern Admiralty"
NLR_admiralty2_desc:0 "The remainders of the Equestrian fleet and its ponypower have been reorganised to suits the Empress' desires for a large and powerful naval force to protect the shores and coastlines. It is now without a doubt one of the most advanced fleets in the world."
NLR_patrol_fleet:0 "Refined Patrol Fleet"
NLR_patrol_fleet_desc:0 "Before our fleet can engage an enemy, it has to find it. To that end we've improved radar and float-plane equipment so nothing can pass unnoticed through our territorial waters."
NLR_massive_ships:0 "Supreme Battleships"
NLR_massive_ships_desc:0 "As the battle line shall form the backbone of our navy, it is absolutely imperative we make them the strongest we can. Enchanted metals have been incorporated into their hulls, to let them stand up to even the most punishing attacks."
NLR_deadlymines:0 "Magic-Explosive Mines"
NLR_deadlymines_desc:0 "By incorporating highly explosive unstable crystals into the mine design, we can dramatically improve their explosive yield and destruction."
NLR_deadlytorpedos:0 "Magic-Guided Torpedos"
NLR_deadlytorpedos_desc:0 "Specialized scrying crystals can guide torpedoes to their targets with unerring accuracy, frustrating attempts to dodge them."
NLR_aircontrol:0 "The Naval Shadowbolts"
NLR_aircontrol_desc:0 "Shadowbolts have been incorporated into the carrier air wings, bringing their expertise and skill with them."
NLR_building_navy:0 "Laying Down The Imperial Fleet"
NLR_building_navy_desc:0 "The entire naval industry is being put to the sole purpose of constructing a grand new armada. This has set aside every other project and production, drastically decreasing output for all secondary concerns."
NLR_the_IRS_idea:0 "Imperial Reconstruction Service"
NLR_the_IRS_idea_desc:0 "Wars rarely spare the innocent, and this struggle has left many ponies homeless and destitute. If they are to love and appreciate their Empress, their comfortable lives must be restored to the previous standard through a program of speedy reconstruction."
NLR_free_enterprise_idea:0 "Lunarist Capitalism"
NLR_free_enterprise_idea_desc:0 "The teachings of Eva Blacksmith and Day Ray continue to apply in the Lunar Empire, with some specific regulations to ensure industrialists are working for the benefit of the Empress and state, rather than against them."
NLR_command_economics_idea:0 "Centralised Economic Development"
NLR_command_economics_idea_desc:0 "Unregulated capitalism will cause more problems in the future than its profits can resolve. There needs to be a central authority making interventions in the economy when they arise as necessary."
NLR_the_traditionalist_faith_idea:0 "The Moon, The Princess And The Empress"
NLR_the_traditionalist_faith_idea_desc:0 "The model held by natives and moderates has prevailed as the state religion: the Nightmare, Princess Luna, and the Moon itself are all separate entities. They are equally important to our belief, but must not be considered the same. This separation should also convince the stubborn many, who still remember Princess Luna before her ascension."
NLR_via_media_idea:0 "Via Media"
NLR_via_media_idea_desc:0 "The idea of Via Media has been approved as state religion: it states that the physical Moon, Princess Luna, and the Nightmare are three aspects of the same divine Lunar entity. While not the same as one another, they all represent the same divine force, and so can be worshipped separately while still paying homage to the Moon."
NLR_the_nightmare_idea:0 "The Chiropterran Model"
NLR_the_nightmare_idea_desc:0 "The state religion is one of zealots': there is no Princess Luna; there is merely a lesser form of the Nightmare. There is no Moon; it is merely a manifestation of the Nightmare's power. This is the Lunar faith's absolute truth, supported by our chaplains from Chiropterra and embraced by the Empress. Doctrinal orthodoxy shall be enforced, and heretics prosecuted. None shall dilute our purist faith in the Nightmare."
NLR_the_matter_of_internal_security_idea:0 "The IIS"
NLR_the_matter_of_internal_security_idea_desc:0 "There is always a need to watch after dissidents and agitators. Their treasonous thoughts won't stay hidden for long."
NLR_the_matter_of_internal_security_idea_lar:0 "The IIS"
NLR_the_matter_of_internal_security_idea_lar_desc:0 "There is always a need to watch after dissidents and agitators. Their treasonous thoughts won't stay hidden for long."
NLR_the_magna_carta_idea:0 "The Nightmare Charter"
NLR_the_magna_carta_idea_desc:0 "The Empress has surprised many of Her subjects with a document that defined and elaborates the delegation of power between Her and trusted subordinates. The cynical ponies wonder if this is only a pretence, rather than a genuine attempt at reconciliation."
NLR_divine_right_to_rule_idea:0 "Will To Power"
NLR_divine_right_to_rule_idea_desc:0 "The rule of alicorns has always been uncontested in Equestrian history. None may restrain the Empress in exerting her indomitable force throughout all of Equestria."
NLR_buffalo_code_talkers:0 "Code Talkers"
NLR_buffalo_code_talkers_desc:0 "Although a largely irrelevant species in today's world, the buffalo have agreed to serve the Empress in exchange for autonomy. Their primary roles concern hauling supplies in terrain that suits their rugged physique, as well as assisting in development of cryptographical cyphers based on their largely incomprehensible language, which is certain to be almost unknown outside of their homelands."
NLR_buffalo_code_talkers_lar:0 "Code Talkers"
NLR_buffalo_code_talkers_lar_desc:0 "Although a largely irrelevant species in today's world, the buffalo have agreed to serve the Empress in exchange for autonomy. Their primary roles concern hauling supplies in terrain that suits their rugged physique, as well as assisting in development of cryptographical cyphers based on their largely incomprehensible language, which is certain to be almost unknown outside of their homelands."

### Focuces ###
NLR_legacy_of_the_shadowbolts:0 "Legacy Of The Shadowbolts"
NLR_legacy_of_the_shadowbolts_desc:0 "During the failed uprising against the rotten tyranny of the Sun over a thousand years ago, the Shadowbolts were an elite group of finest pegasi and thestrals to grace the night sky. They inflicted many casualties on the loyalists and they struck fear in the heart of our foes. Their tradition will be maintained in our new Imperial Lunar Air Force."
NLR_adapt_the_spitfire:0 "Build Upon The Gladiator"
NLR_adapt_the_spitfire_desc:0 "Over the course of the civil war, we've captured many fighters and several production factories from the hated Celestial loyalists. While we've adapted the seized assets for our own use, they cannot be relied upon forever, and our pride would be sullied by continuing to use the enemy's designs. We simply must create our own superior machine."
NLR_the_lunar_airborne_corps:0 "The Lunar Strategic Air Service"
NLR_the_lunar_airborne_corps_desc:0 "As warfare continues to shift and change with each new innovation, a few stratagems remain fundamental, one of them being the importance of arriving first on the battlefield. To this end, we've approved the formation of an airborne force that can be deployed anywhere in less than a night, assisted by their parachutes."
NLR_CAS_effort:0 "Battlefield Support Aircraft"
NLR_CAS_effort_desc:0 "The idea of combined arms is an old one, dating back to earth ponies tying down formations to be picked off by pegasi or unicorns. In modern times, it remains underutilised due to the difficulty of coordinating armoured columns, infantry and aircraft. With improved communication systems, it becomes plausible to introduce a specialised aircraft to work in unison with the ground forces."
NLR_strategic_bombing:0 "Calibrated Destruction"
NLR_strategic_bombing_desc:0 "Each resource, each asset denied to the enemy is one that cannot frustrate us in our endeavours. It is not enough to simply break an army on field anymore, their production and morale must be broken on the homefront. It necessitates the most advanced bomber aircraft model, one that can travel longest distances, carry enormous payloads and still be able to fend for itself."
NLR_build_up_the_bomber_fleet:0 "The Imperial Bomber Fleet"
NLR_build_up_the_bomber_fleet_desc:0 "No modern airforce is complete without dedicated bomber squadrons. Escorted by fighters, while being armed themselves to ward off enemy airplanes, they can accomplish what ponies on the ground would struggle to do. Thus it is imperative that the construction of new aircraft begins posthaste and new plans are drawn up for a continuous improvement to their design."
NLR_longer_range:0 "Long Range Bomber Designs"
NLR_longer_range_desc:0 "Firepower is useless if the aircraft cannot make a two-way flight because it ran out of fuel. At the cost of expanding our destructive capabilities, all variants of bomber aircraft will be have their designs enhanced to increase fuel efficiency, extending their operational area."
NLR_bigger_payloads:0 "Payload Calibration"
NLR_bigger_payloads_desc:0 "The act of bombardment by itself is not a precise science. Airponies can be trained as much as we wish, and technology is continuously improving, but the bombs themselves must be let loose at a precise moment, lest they completely miss a target. To compensate for this innate inaccuracy, bomber models will carry higher amounts of payload from here on."
NLR_imperial_RADAR_system:0 "The Continental RADAR System"
NLR_imperial_RADAR_system_desc:0 "Originally developed for civilian purposes, radar has proven to be far more useful for military operations. Radio waves can detect distant objects far better than any pair of pony's eyes, and an interconnected array of towers dedicated for this specific purpose will protect our fair empire from any surprise invasions."
NLR_jet_engine_experiments:0 "Jet Engine Experimentation"
NLR_jet_engine_experiments_desc:0 "Airplanes have come far from their humble origins as a griffon invention, yet the propeller based engines are reaching their limits. It was straightforward to increase speed, but over a certain amount it causes the aircraft to break apart. Thus it has become necessary to reinvent the plane itself, solving the current problems plaguing our designers."

NLR_a_new_army:0 "The Second Imperial Army"
NLR_a_new_army_desc:0 "If the Empress is to exert Her indomitable will, she requires a grand army, one to match the legions she raised against the tyranny of the Sun over a thousand years ago. It is to be distinct and loyal to the Empress and her ideals, and entirely separate from the stagnant past. Long live the Night!"
NLR_emergency_recruitment:0 "All The Little Ponies"
NLR_emergency_recruitment_desc:0 "With the ongoing confusion and disarray, it becomes more crucial to secure a numerical advantage where it matters most. Most ponies take a dim view on serving and dying for a distant overlord, but with enough benefits many could be convinced otherwise. The incurred debt is irrelevant if we prevail in the end."
NLR_dig_up_the_caches:0 "Guns, Grenades And Uniforms"
NLR_dig_up_the_caches_desc:0 "Equestria is large, yet sparsely populated outside of major and minor settlements. Hidden in the countryside that sees little traffic are various caches of equipment stashed by the Empress' most loyal thestrals. The exact locations of this materiel must be uncovered to replenish our stockpiles."
NLR_train_the_officers:0 "Chiropterran Training Manuals"
NLR_train_the_officers_desc:0 "Even though the uprising is still in its early stages, the Empress's most loyal Legionnaires have arrived from Zebrica and are appalled at our officer corps' state. They have demanded the privilege of instructing all our commanders in the ways of modern war so that our officers may be superior to the Solarists."
NLR_war_propaganda:0 "Hearts And Minds"
NLR_war_propaganda_desc:0 "Our rebellion is one of righteous liberty against anti-thestral tyranny and racism! This message shall be broadcasted across the land by our "public relations" team, and so all the ponies of Equus shall know our aims are utterly pure, even if they must learn by force. The less savoury aspects of our intentions will be vehemently denied."
NLR_the_new_continental_warmaster:0 "The Warmaster Of Equus"
NLR_the_new_continental_warmaster_desc:0 "The New Lunar Army at present functions more as a horde, than a stratified command structure. It has proven itself effective, but that is due to our troops' valor and devotion, not the efficiency of our leadership. So, at the advice of our Chiropterran friends, the Empress has decided to appoint an Imperial Warmaster to lead the armies in her steed."
NLR_army_mechanisation:0 "Mass Mechanisation"
NLR_army_mechanisation_desc:0 "What became obvious to some ponies after the failed changeling invasion of 1002 didn't caught up with Equestria's top brass: the armed forces remained primitive in terms of adopting mechanised vehicles as means of transporting soldiers. Fortunately, our Empress is far more adept at waging war, and She has demanded a program of intense modernisation to ensure the supremacy of the Night."
NLR_roll_out_tanks:0 "Roll Out The Muletilda"
NLR_roll_out_tanks_desc:0 "Mostly invulnerable to small arms, the contemporary tank is a mobile engine of destruction and firepower - if properly supported, that is. Having showed their prowess and versatility already, it is expected that armed mechanised vehicles will soon form a part of every army there is. We must be assiduous in implementing this new weapon."
NLR_roll_out_new_rifles:0 "Standardisation Of Equipment"
NLR_roll_out_new_rifles_desc:0 "Captured firearms, family heirlooms, strange weapons from distant lands, it seems that the Lunar Army has more types of rifles than soldiers. The gunsmiths and quartermasters are becoming overwhelmed with requests, and it falls upon the state to iron out this problem. The solution beckons itself: one approved rifle design for everypony to use, easily replaceable and maintainable."
NLR_new_artillery:0 "Artillery Modernisation"
NLR_new_artillery_desc:0 "What ordnance we could scrounge up is either woefully outdated or simply insufficient in its amount. The Empress finds it inexcusable to be lacking in big guns to grind Her enemies into dust. While there are enough existing models for experimentation, additional funding and ponypower is needed to hasten the process."
NLR_new_support_equipment:0 "Specialised Squad Training"
NLR_new_support_equipment_desc:0 "One pony cannot be expected to handle everything - thus we have the delegation of tasks. While most will serve in a direct combat role, others are required for less glorious but not less important duties such as digging trenches, building bridges, maintaining communication and supply lines. The lives of many will depend on these diligent few."
NLR_legacy_of_the_legions:0 "The Legions Come Again"
NLR_legacy_of_the_legions_desc:0 "Soldiers fight more efficiently if they are led to believe they're emulating centuries of pride and martial tradition. The army of today might not be the ideal successors of the Nightmare Legions of yore, but we can still reinstate what once was. Furthermore, knowing that there is a higher cause to devote towards, more ponies will join the battle."
NLR_lunar_continental_command:0 "The Imperial Continental Command"
NLR_lunar_continental_command_desc:0 "It is not a question of where and why to wage war, but rather when and how. To achieve success on an operational and strategical level, the high command must set forth guidelines for commanders in the field to adhere towards. Once a promising tactic is found, we can commence elaborating it for further results."
NLR_the_logistics_corps:0 "The Lunar Logistics Department"
NLR_the_logistics_corps_desc:0 "The vastness of Equestria presents a difficult challenge for our quartermasters and logisticians. Although the supply routes between major cities are relatively functional, anything that requires us to travel through the deserts, jungles, or even mountains will present an insurmountable obstacle. Some modernisation in our transport vehicles is required."
NLR_airdropped_supplies:0 "Massed Supply Airdrop Operations"
NLR_airdropped_supplies_desc:0 "The reach of an army has always been dictated by how far its supply wagons can follow. One of our theoreticians has thus proposed a seemingly radical idea: apply what we've learned from our bombing trials and apply it to supply delivery. The required resources will be able to reach any part of the land without the need for airstrips or other dedicated facilities."
NLR_mass_mobilisation:0 "The Army Service Registry Agency"
NLR_mass_mobilisation_desc:0 "Celestia was a fool and a coward who didn't realise the value of a standing army, preferring to believe her pampered bodyguard force would suffice. The Night Empress shall not repeat the mistakes of the past, giving the order to increase the number of ponies waiting to be hired for a tour of duty, as well as demanding increased training standards overall."
NLR_special_warfare_department:0 "Night Guard Expertise"
NLR_special_warfare_department_desc:0 "The warriors of the Night have truly proven themselves to be worthy of the Lunar banner, carrying out numerous unconventional operations during and after the civil war, pushing their limits ever so further. While many ponies would say they simply did what was necessary for their Empress, we are more interesting in distributing these skills to the next generation of soldiers."
NLR_bring_it_to_bear:0 "Industrial Mobilisation"
NLR_bring_it_to_bear_desc:0 "Continued demand for more and more materiel has shown our existing production capabilities to be reaching their practical limits. To ease the pressure from an already beleaguered workforce, we'll simply have to invest in opening new industrial complexes to serve our increased requirements."
NLR_heavier_plating:0 "Project: Tempest's Box"
NLR_heavier_plating_desc:0 "To withstand ever increasing amounts of firepower, armoured vehicles need to adapt by increasing the thickness of their armour plating, while maintaining respectable firepower and mobility. To this end, our proponent for mobile warfare and mechanisation - Tempest Wind - has submitted several new designs waiting for approval."
NLR_anti_tank_equipment_prep:0 "The QF 17-Pounder"
NLR_anti_tank_equipment_prep_desc:0 "We are not alone in our push for mechanisation, for other nations and rivals too have begun to utilise the strengths of tanks. It would be best to divert some resources in developing a specialised version of artillery focused exclusively on removing these new threats, lest we face issues in the future when it will take considerably longer to overcome them."
NLR_quantity_over_quality:0 "The Endless Wave Of Steel"
NLR_quantity_over_quality_desc:0 "Everypony's expectations have been met by the continued development and trials of tanks, but there is an issue of reliability that would be far too expensive to rectify on a wide scale. Delicate machinery is prone to breaking in strenuous conditions, and our response to this problem is satisfying the minimum in material, and maximum in amount of reserves."
NLR_quality_over_quantity:0 "Quality Over Quantity"
NLR_quality_over_quantity_desc:0 "The best case scenario does not exist in real life; it is inevitable that a tank will face difficult terrain, random mechanical failures or overpowering enemy fire. It would be prudent to pursue a considerable investment in increasing the reliability of these vehicles, as they form the crux of our military thought."

NLR_the_imperial_admirality:0 "Rebuild The Admiralty"
NLR_the_imperial_admirality_desc:0 "Equestria is a land with perhaps the longest unbroken length of coastline, and the recent bouts of instability, warfare and defections have left these shores vulnerable and undefended. Although it is unlikely that a foreign invasion from distant lands would arrive, having a rebuilt naval power to project our strength would ward off any delusional would-be conquerors. The Empress' domain is solely Hers."
NLR_restart_the_shipyards:0 "Subsidise The Shipyards"
NLR_restart_the_shipyards_desc:0 "The rebuilding efforts are well at hoof, but what the naval industry needs is a swift and decisive funding from the state apparatus. By investing in both private and national coastal enterprises, they will be indebted towards us. Our primary goal is the expansion and improvement of existing dockyards, harbours and piers in preparation for the next stage of naval building."
NLR_the_coastal_fleet:0 "The Imperial Coast Guard"
NLR_the_coastal_fleet_desc:0 "A substantial number of light vessels and patrol boats have been captured during the struggle against Celestial tyranny, however their various state of disrepair left the majority of them mothballed or scrapped for iron. What we need is a modern design for a light and durable warship that can cross long distances while being easy to retrofit for any purpose, from laying mines to submarine hunting."
NLR_the_lunar_marines:0 "Her Majesty's Imperial Marine Corps"
NLR_the_lunar_marines_desc:0 "A grand army has many soldiers, but a truly magnificent one has many specialists, as well. The kind that the common soldier looks up to in awe, inspiring stallions and mares with their daring feats of bravery in difficult circumstances. This thought has led to the idea of forming dedicated squadrons specialised in fighting in amphibious terrain, who shall the first to carry the Lunar banner across waters."
NLR_aviation:0 "The Naval Aviation Department"
NLR_aviation_desc:0 "Despite advancements in shipbuilding, naval vessels have shown to be vulnerable to attacks from the skies if they're unsupported by aircraft of their own. Thus it would be prudent to convert one of our existing bomber designs to be suited for crossing vast oceans and carrying a higher payload. Additionally, plans have been drawn up for a variant that can launch from converted cruiser hulls."
NLR_carrier_development:0 "Floating Fortresses"
NLR_carrier_development_desc:0 "To many, the idea of a warship without armament seems preposterous and absurd. After all, haven't capital ships shown their strength in many engagements over the years, not to mention their intimidating scale? However, aircraft has drastically changed the balance in naval warfare, and our forward-thinking theorists believe that carriers are the true rulers of the waves, replacing battleships."
NLR_superior_submarines:0 "Submarine Development Grants"
NLR_superior_submarines_desc:0 "With the advancement in communications and detection, trying to intercept enemy vessels is becoming a dangerous endeavour. With convoys increasingly travelling in groups to deter lone raiders, it becomes apparent for a need to improve on the submersible ships known as submarines. Their presence in contested waters allows us to further project our naval power and have a larger view of the situation."
NLR_battleship_advancements:0 "Battleship Modernisation"
NLR_battleship_advancements_desc:0 "Conservative, safe-minded thinkers believe the age of battleship has not yet waned, in spite of changing circumstances. Perhaps they may be right, for the Empress has approved the decision to allocate funds into modernising the inherited battleship fleet. She is confident that with heavier weapons and thicker armour plates, these mighty vessels will signal the wider world of our supremacy."
NLR_carrier_crusier_advancements:0 "Cruiser Development"
NLR_carrier_crusier_advancements_desc:0 "There exists a need for lighter vessels to screen our more imposing warships. A hoofstep above destroyers, cruisers and battlecruisers provide an invaluable role in engaging and destroying enemy screens, while also being disposable enough to escort civilian ships. Their continued improvement is crucial for the control of the Equestrian waters."
NLR_lay_down_the_fleet:0 "The Imperial Fleet Reborn"
NLR_lay_down_the_fleet_desc:0 "With the culmination of our research and development, the Empress has allocated a significant amount of resources towards finalising the launch of the new Lunar navy. Her deadlines are unforgiving, and She will personally inspect the fleet as it makes the maiden voyage. It would be best not to disappoint Her Imperial Majesty, and put all our efforts in making the most glorious armada the world has ever seen."

NLR_civil_war_end:0 "The Empire Triumphant"
NLR_civil_war_end_desc:0 "With the Celestial resistance in shambles, and the banishment of our most hated foes, the night sky can truly shine wide across Equestria. There is no time to rest, however, as our victory isn't set in stone. Ponies all across Equestria must be brought back to heed the word of the Empress, to establish the Night that never ends."
NLR_the_IRS:0 "Establish The Imperial Reconstruction Service"
NLR_the_IRS_desc:0 "Ponies are thought to be a docile and pacifist species, yet the recent struggle has shown to be the complete opposite case. Hundreds and thousands of homes, bridges, workplaces and more lay in ruins - the damage cannot be accurately measured beyond "too many bits". To restore the rightful order and rule of law, the onus is on the new government to commence a period of rebuilding and healing."
NLR_rebuild_the_railways:0 "Rebuilding the Railways"
NLR_rebuild_the_railways_desc:0 "Equestria is vast and difficult to traverse. It used to be said that one could spend years without seeing every town there is, before the invention of railways and personal automobiles, that is. However, much infrastructure lays devastated and inoperable - partly because of our operations - and it needs to be repaired through a series of massive public works programs."
NLR_imperial_corporations:0 "Establish The Imperial Corporations"
NLR_imperial_corporations_desc:0 "The formerly liberal Equestrian economy needs to be reorganised into something more controllable. An Imperial Corporation shall be established for each sector of the economy, and all of them will be directly subordinate to the Empress. Any economic activity outside of these strictly-regulared corporations must be quenched entirely. This will guarantee the harmonious functioning of the national economy."
NLR_restore_the_academina:0 "Academic Restoration"
NLR_restore_the_academina_desc:0 "Regardless of who sits on the throne of Equestria, educating capable ponies must be one of the priorities for the Empress to resume in the earnest. There will be some necessary changes to the curriculum regarding the rightful place of the thestrals, but the business of universities should continue unabated, as long as they do not sow dissent among young impressionable minds."
NLR_free_enterprise:0 "Lunarist Capitalism"
NLR_free_enterprise_desc:0 "Seemingly nebulous, the principles of free market and the invisible hoof, coined by Eva Blacksmith and Day Ray in the previous century, have served Equestria well. In spite of growing class inequality, the land has prospered and reached new heights of modernity. Why reinvent the saddle? To get rich for the Empress shall remain glorious."
NLR_command_economics:0 "Centralised Economic Development"
NLR_command_economics_desc:0 "The state can be understood as having certain goals and priorities. These do not always correspond with the wishes of the private sector, which can lead to shortages of necessary goods, or overproduction of a commodity. Thus it becomes necessary for the government to intervene in economic matters, ensuring we are prepared for any future ocassion without relying on the fickle whims of the invisible hoof."
NLR_the_matter_of_the_prisoners:0 "The Prisoners Of War"
NLR_the_matter_of_the_prisoners_desc:0 "The war has been cruel and brutal, but many have still surrendered rather than to face oblivion. Tending after prisoners is not cheap or productive, however, and it must be decided what to do with these forlorn ponies before they perish from squalid living conditions. Or even worse, stage a rebellion. Idleness breeds contempt."
NLR_pardon_the_elements:0 "A Pardon For The Element Bearers"
NLR_pardon_the_elements_desc:0 "The Elements of Harmony are one of the very few artefacts that can harm the Empress, but the mares wielding them need not suffer harm. Mere pawns of Celestia, nothing more. We can show the ponies that we are kind and merciful, while keeping the dangerous jewels under lock and key in a safe location."
NLR_control_the_elements:0 "Crime And Punishment"
NLR_control_the_elements_desc:0 "These mares are dangerous, but not in an obvious way: who knows what they conspire behind closed doors and curtains. It would be the simplest solution to simply hang them at moonfall, but the poorly understood magic of the Elements could result in unforeseen consequences in a time distant. The most rational second choice is to monitor them and keep them compliant with a more personal threat."
NLR_the_matter_of_religion:0 "A Tale Of Two Sisters"
NLR_the_matter_of_religion_desc:0 "Long ago, there were two regal sisters who ruled the land, providing safety and happiness for all the ponies. Now, there is only Nightmare Moon, the true ruler of Equestria. Nonetheless, ponies find comfort in worshipping what they perceive to be divine. An official stance on alicorn divinity has never been made, and shan't be, but we may still regulate the veneration of such."
NLR_trial_of_the_generals:0 "Justice Above All Else"
NLR_trial_of_the_generals_desc:0 "Alongside many captured prisoners of war are their war-leaders. Celestia herself has already been dealt with in an unspecified manner, but there still remains the need to give these rabblerousers a fair and honest trial. If they show proper reverence to the new rule, and forsake their past oaths, the punishment may be more lenient."
NLR_the_fate_of_the_generals:0 "Fire And Vengeance"
NLR_the_fate_of_the_generals_desc:0 "The punishment for grand treason is and has always been summary execution, by one method or the other. By standing with the false Princess Celestia and obstructing the return of the true ruler of Equestria, the loyalist commanders have sealed their fates! A bleak and unyielding Tartarus awaits them for their crimes against Nightmare Moon and the Lunar Empire."
NLR_the_traditionalist_faith:0 "The Moon, The Princess And The Nightmare"
NLR_the_traditionalist_faith_desc:0 "As our official religion, we shall adopt a model held by our native and more moderate supporters in Equestria. That the Nightmare, Princess Luna, and the Moon itself are all separate entities. They are equally important to our belief, but must not be considered the same. This separation should also bring more converts, who still remember Princess Luna."
NLR_via_media:0 "Via Media"
NLR_via_media_desc:0 "The Empress has decided to embrace a Via Media of Lunar theology in order to appease most of her supporters. It states that the physical Moon, Princess Luna, and the Nightmare are three aspects of the same divine Lunar entity. While not the same as one another, they all represent the same divine force, and so can be worshipped separately while still paying homage to the Moon."
NLR_the_nightmare:0 "The Nightmare"
NLR_the_nightmare_desc:0 "There is no Princess Luna; there is merely a lesser form of the Nightmare. There is no Moon; it is merely a manifestation of the Nightmare's power. This is the Lunar faith's absolute truth, supported by our chaplains from Chiropterra and embraced by the Empress. Doctrinal orthodoxy shall be enforced, and heretics prosecuted. None shall dilute our purist faith in the Nightmare."
NLR_order_restored:0 "Law And Order Restored"
NLR_order_restored_desc:0 "The winds of change have swept through Equestria, leaving a society that's drastically different from what used to be the norm. Now, the Moon provides and protects everypony, far better than the useless Celestia ever could. It won't be long until the horrors of the war are forgotten, and the new routine is accepted without question. All thanks to the rational pragmatism employed by our auspicious ruler."
NLR_the_matter_of_free_speech:0 "Social Engineering"
NLR_the_matter_of_free_speech_desc:0 "It takes a few careful words to topple a regime. If the ponies are content in their lives, they won't cause issues, but even the overflowing cornucopia couldn't sway aside dedicated revolutionaries. Thus, it becomes necessary to decide how much should the freedom of speech be regulated, and should it be restricted at all. There is also the question of allowing political activity, as well."
NLR_reward_the_thestrals:0 "Our Most Loyal Subjects"
NLR_reward_the_thestrals_desc:0 "Scorned and ostracised, the thestrals have weathered generations of mistrust by their kin and brethren. Truly, it is they who are deserving the most of Empress' love! This institutionalised discrimination shall henceforth cease to exist, and so called fourth tribe will be welcomed with open hooves by other ponies, regardless of their opinion on the matter."
NLR_the_solarist_plot:0 "Expanding The Imperial Guard"
NLR_the_solarist_plot_desc:0 "The need to project force is always required, particularly after a period of instability and uncertainty. Canterlot still broods over the loss of their "perfect" Princess, and what better way to quell rebellious thoughts than with a show of military might? The Empress' personal guard shall be broadened with the prime soldiers who fought in Her name during the uprising."
NLR_the_matter_of_internal_security:0 "The Imperial Investigative Service"
NLR_the_matter_of_internal_security_desc:0 "There is always a need to maintain vigil for dissidents and traitors. Who better to employ than the night-touched thestrals? The intelligence operatives we've used through the uprising shall be put to use in a more permanent, officialised capacity in an organisation that protects the Empress' interest at home and abroad. The Night always watches."
NLR_the_magna_carta:0 "The Nightmare Charter"
NLR_the_magna_carta_desc:0 "Power is not something lightly shared, but spreading it among ponies makes them feel they're respected and appreciated for their efforts in managing a state. Furthermore, the resistance would lose much of their ammunition if the "Lunar tyrant" delegated Her responsibilities. So it shall be: an official legal document that strictly defines the relationship between the Empress and Her subjects."
NLR_divine_right_to_rule:0 "The Empress' Divine Right"
NLR_divine_right_to_rule_desc:0 "Alicorns have always been above other pony races, imbued with all of their traits and superior to even the most accomplished mage, warrior or craftspony. It is only natural that the Empress rules with the strength of Her own force and will, Her indomitable nature assuring Her decisions are always just, correct and the optimal choice for the state."
NLR_equestria_secured:0 "The Empire Secured"
NLR_equestria_secured_desc:0 "Equestria hasn't seen such an upheaval since the first Nightmare Uprising, but our efforts have resulted in creation of a state that does its function far better than the predecessor. The Empress protects the weak, punishes the insolent and rules over the entirety of Equestria. Long may the everlasting Night reign!"

NLR_north_eastern_direction:0 "War Plan: Red"
NLR_north_eastern_direction_desc:0 "Further to the north, a disparate group of ponies have cast aside Celestia's yoke and formed their own state. An admirable achievement, if it weren't for their dangerous ideology which threatens to overcome their borders, sweeping aside the established rule in a bloody revolution for a nebulous fantasy that is thoroughly unviable. They must be stopped in their tracks."
NLR_end_the_experiment:0 "Conclude The Marksist Experiment"
NLR_end_the_experiment_desc:0 "With the debellation of the communist state, the task has left to us to pacify and control the civilian populace. Some held little love for their overlords, laying low to dissuade any unwarranted attention, but a far greater number of ponies have become ideologically indoctrinated and refuse to cooperate with their new rulers. A thorough dismantling of the Marksist system is required to bring them in line."
NLR_south_west_direction:0 "War Plan: Grey"
NLR_south_west_direction_desc:0 "Opportunists, deserters and war profiteers - these few words sum the motivations of ponies in southwestern Equestria. This area is comparatively worth less than the rest, were it not for the recent growth in oil processing industries. As the Empress of all Equestrian ponies, they must be brought back to the fold."
NLR_the_time_the_house_didnt_win:0 "The Empress That Broke The House"
NLR_the_time_the_house_didnt_win_desc:0 "Las Pegasus is a curious case, a secession caused by personal interests and greed, rather than deluded ideas of revolution or resistance. Nonetheless, their resistance has been crushed and their ploys have been undone; it remains to be seen what to do with their leaders and resources. Arrogant industrialists will think twice before dreaming of another "get rich quick" scheme."
NLR_night_riders_in_dixie:0 "Night Time In Mixie"
NLR_night_riders_in_dixie_desc:0 "The southern ponies are stubborn and difficult to control. Fiercely proudful of their independent nature centered around private property and ownership of firearms, their opposition makes it difficult to integrate the region. Without local collaborators, there'll be a need for harsh measures to restore control."
NLR_matter_of_the_buffalo:0 "The Buffalo Question"
NLR_matter_of_the_buffalo_desc:0 "The buffalo have lived along the prairies and deserts of the southwest for many generations, in blissful isolation from others who would interfere in their sacred traditions. Their wandering areas have been far greater in the past, but today they are confined to the heartlands of their ancestral homes. Perhaps they might have a use, if the Empress decrees so."
NLR_south_east_direction:0 "War Plan: Green"
NLR_south_east_direction_desc:0 "Stars Whirl and her garrison have miserably failed in their task to secure south-eastern Equestria. Rebels have seized control of the region and defy the rule of our Empress. We need to prepare a military campaign to crush the insurgency and save the local thestral population before it is too late. They are our most loyal subjects, and will undoubtedly welcome us as liberators."
NLR_the_native_question:0 "South-Eastern Reorganisation"
NLR_the_native_question_desc:0 "Under Celestia's misguided rule, the south-east suffered from neglect and underdevelopment. Our Empress is not so heartless, especially as the region is the homeland of thestrals and contains many lunarist holy sites. She is determined to improve the livelihoods of the local thestral communities and providing care which Celestia failed to give."
NLR_integrate_NMS_leadership:0 "Integrate The Disciples' Leadership"
NLR_integrate_NMS_leadership_desc:0 "Despite all the resistance they faced, our loyal commanders of the south-eastern garrison have managed to survive. Now that the fighting in the region is over, we can welcome them back to our ranks - at least, those who are still alive. They have proven themselves to be determined and cunning fighters, and we are in need of experienced officers for the Imperial Army."
NLR_north_north_west_direction:0 "War Plan: White"
NLR_north_north_west_direction_desc:0 "In Vanhoover, navy officers mutinied as the civil war broke out and rebelled against Celestia's rule. But this does not make them our friends, as they instead established a tyrannical communist government. Not only that, but our northern border must be secured and the loyalty of the Crystal Empire ensured. Our Empress saved them from Sombra a thousand years ago; in return, they should recognize her supremacy."
NLR_reclaim_the_fleet:0 "Reclaim The Fleet"
NLR_reclaim_the_fleet_desc:0 "When the civil war broke out, the opportunistic admiral Dust Hoover took a majority of the Equestrian fleet to Vanhoover, where he set up his tinpot socialist dictatorship, hoping to connect with his distant allies in Stalliongrad. Fortunately, his revolution has failed, and what's left is to scour the area of his supporters and reclaim the fleet before they deny it to us."
NLR_integrate_CRY:0 "Integrate The Crystal Administration"
NLR_integrate_CRY_desc:0 "Now that the Crystal Empire is secured within the Lunar Dominion, we can prepare to expand the Imperial administration northwards. It is especially vital that Crystal City will be integrated smoothly, so we gain full control of its significant industry and population. As we keep the royal family of the Crystal Empire as hostages, the locals should think twice before resisting us."
NLR_down_with_the_changelings:0 "War Plan: Black"
NLR_down_with_the_changelings_desc:0 "The changelings are the greatest threat to the continued existence of the Lunar hegemony. They've been squatting in their hives, planning their vengeance for many years now. Unlike others who pretend to rule Equestria, they're exceptionally dangerous and utilise the most modern military strategies and armaments. This will be the battle to decide the future of Equus."
NLR_destroy_OLE:0 "War Plan: Brown"
NLR_destroy_OLE_desc:0 "Olenia is a weak and corrupt nation, wracked by internal instability. The deer clearly are too inept to run a country, so why should we let them remain independent? Under Lunar rule, Olenia will know peace, prosperity and above all, order. By having both deer and changelings in our sphere of influence, the two races can finally end their bitter rivalry and learn to live together."
NLR_strike_at_the_yaks:0 "War Plan: Blue"
NLR_strike_at_the_yaks_desc:0 "The yaks are a savage, barbaric race and threaten the security of our northernmost border. We need to pacify Yakyakistan and include it in the Lunar dominion, so their backwards nation may properly modernize. The rich natural resources of their lands will also be greatly beneficial for our economy. While an offensive across the mountains is going to be difficult, it will be worthwhile."
NLR_strike_at_the_nova_griffonians:0 "War Plan: Gold"
NLR_strike_at_the_nova_griffonians_desc:0 "Nova Griffonia is a remnant of the Griffonian Empire's rule on OUR continent. Griffons don't belong on Equus anyways, but for now we must simply crush the erstwhile colony and ensure they will never be reclaimed by the Empire. This war will also be necessary to secure control of the strategically vital northern straits and the resource-rich Dulli mountains."
NLR_conquer_the_pole:0 "War Plan: Cyan"
NLR_conquer_the_pole_desc:0 "The frigid northern coast of Equus is home to polar bears and penguins, both of which have weak nations unable to resist foreign rule. The northern sea lanes are economically important and need to be under Lunar protection. Not to mention the fact that our Empress cannot claim to control all of Equus without taking these frozen backwater territories. Her rule must reach even the furthest corners of the continent."
NLR_sea_expansion:0 "War Plan: Crimson"
NLR_sea_expansion_desc:0 "New Mareland was once loyal to Celestia, yet for some inexplicable reason they have refused to recognize our Empress as their legitimate ruler. These traitors must be taught a lesson, but first we need to secure control of the Celestial Sea. For that, the brutish dragons will need to be subjugated. The Navy will have a vital role in these operations, so first we should make sure it is ready to fulfill its duty."
NLR_empress_of_equus:0 "The Empress Of Equus"
NLR_empress_of_equus_desc:0 "After much bloodshed, all enemies of the Empress have been vanquished and the moon now shines brightly across all of Equus. Truly, our Empress is not merely the ruler of Equestria, but the master of the entire continent! She shall now assume her rightful and divine position as the Empress of Equus. Hail the Lady of the Moon, the Mistress of the Night and the Herald of Darkness! All shall praise her name!"

NLR_civil_war_economy:0 "The New Equestrian Economy"
NLR_civil_war_economy_desc:0 "The chaos of war has been a great calamity for the Equestrian economy. For it to recover, the Empire must directly intervene and save our industry before it is too late. The sooner things return to how they were before the struggle, the sooner will ponies accept the rule of the Empress."
NLR_repurpose_factories:0 "The Bread For Work Program"
NLR_repurpose_factories_desc:0 "The civil war has disrupted supply chains and resulted in widespread lack of basic necessities. The most basic purpose of government is to provide for its citizens in times of crisis, and this we shall do. Food, drinking water, clothing and housing will be provided to those in need, in return for labour in the armament factories."
NLR_expand_arms_factories:0 "The Empress Demands More Guns!"
NLR_expand_arms_factories_desc:0 "In the darkness of the night, the warm glow of vast forges bathes our cities in dim light, endlessly churning out weapons for our army. Yet it is not enough. More is always needed to supply our numerous soldiers. And we will have more. New factories will be built to satisfy our demands."
NLR_quick_oil_assembly:0 "Cover The Shortages"
NLR_quick_oil_assembly_desc:0 "Despite Equestria's industrial size, there remains a need for crucial resources such as oil and rubber. Although there are plentiful natural deposits, they are typically located in areas where infrastructure is underdeveloped, making exploitation of such difficult. For the time being, we must rely on artificial synthesis of oil and rubber."
NLR_secure_southern_oil:0 "Repossess The Southern Oil Fields"
NLR_secure_southern_oil_desc:0 "Celestia foolishly allowed oil barons to acquire the rich oil wells of the south and use them for personal gain. This made ponies such as Rockfeller extraordinarily wealthy and influential. The Empress has no need for such powerful individuals, and she needs the oil wells to feed the Imperial Army. As such, the oil wells will be nationalized and all of their production will be utilized by the Empire."
NLR_new_mining_projects:0 "New Mining Projects"
NLR_new_mining_projects_desc:0 "There is always a demand for more raw resources, especially in the military sector of our industry. Equestrian surveyors had already identified many promising deposits, but they could not be exploited before the war began. By securing control of these areas, we can send our miners to work, increasing the resource supply needed for economical production."
NLR_steel_milling:0 "A Hundred Little Things"
NLR_steel_milling_desc:0 "The wider populace remains sceptical of our rule and thus are hesitant to support the war effort. We need to gain their trust by providing them cheap consumer goods in these times of scarcity. In the end, as long as the citizenry's basic needs are fulfilled, they are content with their rulers."
NLR_lunar_mining_company:0 "Create The IM&DS"
NLR_lunar_mining_company_desc:0 "To direct our mining operations, the Imperial Mining and Drilling Service shall be established, comprised of experienced engineers, geologists, surveyors, managers and others.

NLR_radio_equestria:0 "Radio Nox"
NLR_radio_equestria_desc:0 "Around Equestria, supporters have sprung up, using the newest technology to rally supporters to our cause and boost morale in the field. A most novel idea, we shall give our official support and aid to these brave people so that ours and their messages may reach ever further on the airwaves, to be reached by soldiers and civilians alike."
NLR_tactical_computing:0 "Magical Crypto Machines"
NLR_tactical_computing_desc:0 "Encryption and decryption requires ever increasing amounts of processing power, which cannot be provided by sharp minds alone. By using crystals for storing and handling binary data, we can create rudimentary machines capable of completing complex algorithms needed by various methods of cryptology. This effort should receive Imperial Patronage."
NLR_industrial_methods:0 "Lessons From The War"
NLR_industrial_methods_desc:0 "The war put a great amount of pressure on our industry, pushing us to innovate new and more efficient methods of production. In times of peace, these methods can be refined and formalized, so they can be widely applied across all industrial sectors, thus greatly increasing production rates."
NLR_civilian_manufacturing:0 "The Industrial Heartland"
NLR_civilian_manufacturing_desc:0 "The eastern coast of Equestria has for centuries been one of the most developed parts of the nation, especially after industrialisation took place. This means we have a strong economic core, mostly safe from the ravages of war. We should use its production capability to develop other, less developed regions, as well as expand pre-existing facilities."
NLR_connect_east_coast:0 "Her Imperial Majesty's Railway System"
NLR_connect_east_coast_desc:0 "Celestia neglected the infrastructure of many Equestrian regions, but our Empress is better than that. She has already commissioned a grand project to expand the railroad network across the entire country, to connect even the more isolated settlements."
NLR_expand_shipyards:0 "Expand The Shipyards"
NLR_expand_shipyards_desc:0 "After the civil war began, only a portion of all the ships of the Equestrian Navy became part of the Lunar Navy. Our fleets are not worthy of the Empress and need to be expanded, but that will be a slow effort if we do not first invest in our drydocks. Only then can we create the grandest armada of the world."
NLR_industrial_powerhouse:0 "An Economic Powerhouse"
NLR_industrial_powerhouse_desc:0 "With our Empress' most wise investments, our economy is not only recovering from the turmoil of war, it is beginning to boom. All loyal servants of the Empire shall enjoy the fruits of their labour as a new golden age of prosperity begins for our nation."
NLR_unicorn_academy_f:0 "Reopen The School For Gifted Unicorns"
NLR_unicorn_academy_f_desc:0 "Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns was Equestria's premiere educational institution for magically talented ponies. There is no reason why our Empress shouldn't become the new patron of the facility. The damages from war will be repaired and it will be reopened, welcoming promising pupils into its halls. Perhaps our Empress can even find a protege among them..."
NLR_academic_militarism:0 "Academic Militarism"
NLR_academic_militarism_desc:0 "For some reason, Celestia never set up any mandatory military education in the academia, contributing to crippling military weakness. With the Empress' patronage, national universities can open new courses for all students teaching basic military theory. Some of these students will hopefully one day become gifted theorists innovating new strategies for the army to use."
NLR_the_power_of_the_atom:0 "The Ultima Equation"
NLR_the_power_of_the_atom_desc:0 "One of the professors in the School For Gifted Unicorns has written a differential equation describing the number of free neutrons present in nuclear fuel.

He dubbed it the "Ultima Equation", and it is clearly the breakthrough we needed to develop mago-nuclear weaponry."
NLR_luna_nova_f:0 "The Luna Nova Imperial Academy"
NLR_luna_nova_f_desc:0 "In a vain attempt to make amends with her sister, Princess Celestia founded the town of Luna Nova and allowed our Empress to establish an academy there. Now Celestia is gone and her loyalists have been driven out of the town, which had proven to be nothing more than a nest of traitors. Now the town will be rebuilt and its academy once more returned to its founder. It shall become more glorious than ever."
NLR_fate_of_equestrian_companies:0 "The Fate Of The Industrialists"
NLR_fate_of_equestrian_companies_desc:0 "Equestria had many wealthy capitalists and businessponies who remained loyal to Celestia during the war, funding her armies and fuelling her economy. Now they shall all be brought before the Empress to be judged. Their vast possessions could be confiscated by the Empire, or they could be given another chance and allowed to cooperate with the Empress. Soon it shall be decided."
NLR_secure_the_banks:0 "Create The IBS"
NLR_secure_the_banks_desc:0 "The Equestrian banking system is in disarray after the war. Because loans and monetary services are so vital to a healthy economy, we must step in and restructure the banks. The Imperial Banking Service shall be founded, acting as the national bank and managing regional banks. With this, we hope to restore some order and make loans straightforward to acquire."
NLR_research_centre:0 "The Imperial Research Center"
NLR_research_centre_desc:0 "The Lunar Empire has many educational institutions within its borders, but not enough facilities that focus solely on technological research instead of teaching the youth.

NLR_revive_eea:0 "Revive The EEA"
NLR_revive_eea_desc:0 "The EEA was once the authority for all education in Equestria. While it has fallen into disuse due to the civil war, our Empress has come up with a novel idea to repurpose the EEA to serve the new Lunar state in all matters educational. This will enable us to both secure our rule, and focus our educational efforts."

lunas.2.d:0 "News have just arrived from the South. The situation there seems to have gone sideways, and the frontlines have all but collapsed. Various local rebel and loyalist groups have risen up, and our grip on the region is already slipping. We have to reorganize our efforts and focus on the north: the south is already lost to both us and our enemy!"

lunas.3.t:0 "The Tall Tale Counterrevolt"
lunas.3.d:0 "When the conflict erupted, a cadre of lunarists managed to rise up deep in enemy territory and seize the region of Tall Tale. This was to be our nail in the heart of our hated foe's territory; one to weaken them from within. Alas, this effort came crashing down today as a solarist counter-revolt retook the entire region. Tall Tale as well as all the soldiers are lost, as is the strategic advantage."
lunas.3.a:0 "It matters not, we will still win."

lunas.5.d:0 "For months, the southeast has been boiling with conflict between the many different factions in the region. For a while, it seemed as though nothing would come out of those blasted jungles but more death, yet we finally have good news from the region. Both the Solarist militias and the communist rebels have been broken, and the Disciples of the Night stand as the unconquered masters of the South. Their leader has personally arrived in the north to meet with the Empress, pledging the South's undying loyalty to the true master of Equestria."

Thankfully, the Disciples of the Night have not given up the right, holding the line long enough for us to defeat Celestia's primary forces. Now we can finally come to their aid and restore peace and order in the burning jungles."

One such banished pony has now arrived in our country, offering us his services as an officer in the army. He swears loyalty to us and seems trustworthy enough."

lunas.9.d:0 "On a field used for playing buckball in peacetime, a large crowd had gathered, huddled together in the cold evening rain. Most of them were thestrals, but among them were earth ponies, pegasi and unicorns. All of them had a weapon of some sort; a rifle, a pistol, or something crude like a musket or even a pitchfork. The chatter among them stopped when a bat pony officer appeared and shouted "Attention!"\n\nOut of all the ponies on the field, he was the only one wearing a shiny new uniform. His duty was now that of an officer, and he would organize this rabble into a proper fighting unit.\n\n"Disciples of the Night! I am Lieutenant Silent Peaks. You have all come here to fight for equality between the four tribes, for the emancipation of the thestral race, and for the defence of our families against reprisals from Solarists. And it is a noble cause indeed, but a noble cause is not enough to make you good fighters. This is why you will be drilled, and I will turn you donkeys into a battalion worthy of our Empress. Discipline is needed if we wish to be victorious in this war, and discipline requires harshness. Think twice if you are ready for it, and for the horrors of battle. If not, then stop wasting my time and get out of my sight. The rest of you, step forth. We have prepared proper equipment for you, and lodgings for rest. Tomorrow the training will start. My task is to prepare you for the frontline as quickly as possible. It won't be easy for any of us, but by the end of it, you will resemble soldiers instead of angry peasants. Speaking of which, drop those damn pitchforks and come get actual weapons, you maggots!""

Next to the papers was a framed drawing of his daughter. Five minutes Misty Night stood, waiting patiently, until he finished reading and lifted his gaze. "Good, you didn't interrupt me. Now I am even more convinced you are the pony for the task."\n\nMisty Night nodded. "What is your command?"\n\n"I read from your background that you received training from fellow Disciples before taking part in several arms thefts as well as ambushes against Celestial loyalists, and later you volunteered to join the Lunar Army. I think you will be capable of fulfilling this task. The Empress has requested me to prepare ponies to escort a shipment of weapons to our fellow soldiers fighting against insurgents in the south-east. You will lead them and ensure you are not discovered by our enemies. Do you understand?"\n\n"Yes, sir."\n\n"Good. This mission is critical. Failure will be punished. Do not forget this."\n\n"I will not, sir. I would prefer death over failing my Goddess."\n\n"Death may well be your punishment. Now go and get your equipment. You will be leaving in an hour. The shipment is ready."\n\nShe bowed deeply, turned around and left. Silent glanced at the drawing on his desk.\n\n"I hope I can see her again soon," he mumbled quietly."

Canterlot stands empty, and would be a natural location to establish Her reign from. Political power has clustered there for a thousand years, so why not make use of the system already in place? However Manehattan served as her power base during the civil war, and it has plenty of potential to serve as a permanent seat as well. She would be in the centre of the economic heart of Equestria, and the reward of her presence to her loyalists would be appreciated. Of course, perhaps the old Castle of the Two sisters, deep in the Everfree, could be restored to its old splendour? It is where our Empress ascended that fateful night a thousand years ago, and to reign from her place of birth would be a strong symbol."

[CRY.GetNameDef] has barely any thestrals living in it, so why would they care for their plight?\n\nSomething must be done to ensure the safety of the northern frontier. The Empress' advisors have proposed two actions, one of which must be chosen. Either a swift military offensive will be unleashed to bring the crystal ponies under direct Imperial rule, or an envoy will be sent to offer them a chance to peacefully bow before Her. We can expect [CRY.GetLeader] to be unhappy with the ultimatum, but the choice is not theirs, it is our Empress'."

Her chosen people, having bided their time even as we were treated as lesser by the supposedly 'friendly' Solarists, rose to stand by her. They fought, they bled, and and through grim determination and hardened ferocity victory was theirs! History is written today, as in the month of [GetMonth], [GetYear], the Solarists' stranglehold on Equestria was finally broken, and the rightful Empress of these lands was restored to the throne denied her a thousand years ago.\n\nFrom her seat of power in Manehattan, the Empress of the Lunar Empire, Nightmare Moon, has addressed her new subjects. Her words, delivered across all channels of media, were brief, but the meaning is not lost a single pony.\n\n"To all ponies of the lands of Equestria, my subjects. The reign of my feeble, hypocritical sister has ended, and henceforth, the Night shall reign eternal! The age that awaits you will be a greater and more glorious one than these lands have seen in a thousand years and more, and all those who bow shall partake in the greatness that awaits.\n\nTo all those who would dare to presume to question my rule, I have but one thing to tell you. You will not succeed, and you will be broken. As my sister's weakness showed, forgiveness only strengthens your enemies. I will not make that mistake, but I will shield my Empire by whatever means necessary. You choose if you bow to and serve your Empress in shielding these lands, or if you wish to become yet another enemy broken beneath me!\n\nTo those who huddled in fear as my armies marched across the empire, however, I assure you that you have nothing to fear. Your empress can show mercy, and all I ask is that you give me the submission you gave my sister. Do this, and you will have no reason to fear me. Enemies circle the Empire, and I will not passively wait for them to come to us. Serve me in this and beyond, and you will have proven your worth!""

It was very succinct, and its main demand was clear: Bend the knee or be destroyed.\n\nThe Empress wishes to eventually send a governor to ensure our everlasting loyalty to her, which would most likely endanger our sovereignty. However, if we refuse, we will be considered traitors who will receive swift justice from the Lunar Army. [CRY.GetLeader] should consider their response carefully, for the fate of our nation hangs by a very thin thread."

Rarity looked at Nightmare Moon with a frown as she poured hot tea into her cup. The Empress nodded in response.\n\n"Certainly, firstly I would like some biscuits, please," she said, projecting an image of regal disinterest. The unicorn smiled forcedly at the response, all but rolling her eyes at the Empress of Equestria.\n\n"With due respect your majesty, you know what I meant." In response, Nightmare Moon levitated the cup and blew into the steaming liquid, saying nothing even as Rarity watched her. Slowly, the cup rose, and the Empress sipped.\n\n"A good tea. Now where are those biscuits?"\n\n"Certainly, your majesty," Rarity's smile was turning stiff as she levitated a box of biscuits onto the table, Nightmare Moon taking one and biting down on it. "Now, if I am not imposing..." Rarity asked sweetly, letting the question hang in the air.\n\n"Should I have dragged you before me in chains, demanding servitude on pain of death?" Nightmare Moon asked her, the imperious tone with which she usually spoke coming out and leaving Rarity to recoil slightly before seeing the smirk on Nightmare Moon's face."Now that your rudeness has been repaid in kind, I do this for the same reason that I called you here. The Crystal Empire is still defying me, and I am not so simple to think war is the only response. I want you to go to the Crystal Empire, and convince [CRY.GetLeader] to submit to me. In return I will let the crystal ponies keep some of their independence, and you will serve as their governor." The blunt comment left Rarity to stare at Nightmare Moon, who calmly took another bite out of her biscuit. "Your taste in biscuits is commendable.""

Though it is within our Empress' right and ability to simply banish them, she has chosen to put them on trial. The mewling of the populace has demanded attention, and the Empress has chosen to give the accused at least the chance to plead their case before her. Their guilt may be beyond doubt, but the display will serve to reinforce Her absolute power over her subjects, and maybe there are even those who can be turned to serve Her?"

lunas.20.d:0 "Commander Fast Clip served in the Wonderbolts as a drill sergeant as well as Captain Spitfire's second in command. Many of his duties were administrative and he helped with organizing the Equestrian military during the civil war, not the least when it came to training soldiers. Yet at the same time, our reports indicate that he always has been loyal to Equestria, not to its ruler, and maybe this can offer an alternative. If presented with a choice between a lifetime rotting away in prison, and one serving Equestria's new ruler, maybe he will be open to bowing to the Night? Converting one of Celestia's vaunted Wonderbolts to Her service would be a fine trophy. "

At the same time, there are few crimes against the Night that can actually be pinned on him. His execution would cause too much of a stir, especially since he has offered to swear an oath to never raise a hoof against the Night if that is what it takes. Clemency is out of the question, but maybe he could be given exile instead? Throwing him out of the Empire would be one form of mercy, after all. "

The respect he commanded in this role as well as his high status among the nobility meant that converting him was one of Her Majesty's premier goals, and she presented him with the offer before the trial. Blueblood's answer, as it turned out, came within the hour.\n\n"To Her Highness Princess Luna (I have no intent of acknowledging your new, absurd name)\n\nThank you for your letter regarding a general's commission in your forces. Under no circumstances do I consent to this kind of obscene bribe, and ask that I am presented with no further offers of this nature. Disregarding the treason it would entail, the oath about "Serving the Night" is as absurd as it is pointless, and it is my firm intent to not take any position in Equestria until lady cretin and criminal traitor have ceased appointing generals, and preferably ceased everything else as well. There is nothing you or your slaves can offer me, for my one desire at the moment is that the fires of Tartarus may wipe clean the world in which these kinds of deranged lunacies are bred out of villains' degenerated couplings with traitors. \n\nYours\nPrince Blueblood."\n\nHer Majesty was enraged enough that she almost had him summarily executed, yet the realization that this was likely the intent in order to forment unrest among her subjects calmed her. Blueblood will stand trial like all others, even if mercy has long since passed from Her Majesty's mind."

The fact that they were given actual trials have surprised many, and undercut some of the more fervent rabble rousers. Though the Empress is the final word in the Lunar Empire, the law nevertheless hold sway, and those who claim that the ponies of Equestria will be left in anarchy and at her whims have no leg to stand on. It is clear to her closest servants that the process - not the least Blueblood's reply to her offer - vexed her greatly, but in return, her grip on Equestria has tightened as she showed her subjects that contrary to the rabble-rousers doomsday prophecies, there would still be rule of law under her."

Though it makes them willing to fight like possessed on the battlefield, it also means that many times, even the unarmed and the civilian Solarists become targets. Executions of prisoners, pillaging civilian homes and many other attacks have become commonplace. Discipline is maintained for now, yet some commanders are actively using these attacks both as an instrument of terror and a way to reward the more hate-filled among Her Majesty's soldiers."

However, changing its name back to how it was before the Winter Revolution is also out of the question. Princessyn makes ponies think of Celestia, and there are no princesses in Equestria anyways, only an Empress. The populace of the city will not react to the name change happily as they cling on to their foolish revolutionary ideas. Perhaps it would be best to punish them by demolishing the city entirely and deporting its population to the surrounding countryside? While extreme, this would effectively quell any thoughts of resistance.\n\nWhat shall the fate of the city be, your majesty?"

Her Majesty, well aware of this, has called for her staff to put together a plan for the oncoming reconstruction. On this, Corona Australis has taken the lead. To everypony's surprise, she has presented two possible plans for her majesty to choose between. The first prioritizes the rebuilding of the Empire's industrial might. There is no reason to presume that the future will be peaceful, and the Empress wishes for the nation to be strengthened. This has primarily focused on the civilian sector, reasoning that if said sector is strengthened, it will allow for the military to be more rapidly strengthened as well.\n\nThe other plan, meanwhile, was the surprising one. It calls for the reconstruction to focus not on factories, but on rebuilding the civilian infrastructure and destroyed residential areas. The payoff in this plan will be more long term, as it will in part stand as a show of Her Majesty's generosity towards her people, and also ensure that the workers that were going to build said factories do not have to worry about their families living in the ruins of their homes. A sheltered, well fed and grateful population will make for a stronger nation in the long run, even if the short term benefits will be absent."

The war is over, and her majesty's future is secured. They were on the wrong side of the conflict, but if they are allowed to back to their families and homes they will serve the empress through their labour and the families they raise. Some on this side are hesitant to merely let them go, and claim that their freedom should be on the condition that they renounce their loyalty to Equstria.\n\nThe more fervent of Her Majesty's servants say this would dishonour the memory of those who fell against these Solarists, and that any Solarist who wishes for their freedom owes a debt of blood to the Empress, a debt they can pay off through hard labour until Her Majesty decides it is repaid."

It was too late, he'd already committed, and he wanted to go home.\n\n"I swear to serve the Empress of the Night," the warden read, "I renounce all loyalties not given to her, and swear to obey her and the leaders she has chosen for me from now until my last breath." As the warden finished reading, the entire room looked to Blue Skies, who inhaled and began to repeat it."

Whenever any of them relented, there was a crack of the whip over their heads only seconds later. Blue Skies felt like his muscles would snap soon, yet worse than that was his throat. He was so thirsty, thirstier than he ever imagined somepony could be. Doing all he could to keep his pickaxe moving, he begged silently for the bell to ring, and yet it seemed to never come.\n\n"Move!" the overseer yelled behind them as the whip cracked right above his head, making Blue Skies flinch. Earlier, he'd thought about turning on the overseer and cram that whip down his throat, yet right now all he could think about was water. When the bell finally came he didn't even step back, instead only collapsing onto the ground, weakly holding onto his pickaxe.\n\nThey'd been building this railroad for weeks now, and every day seemed more gruelling than the last. Whether over hill or vale, they didn't get any respite, only being told to keep working. Were they going to die out here, building railroads for the Lunarists? He didn't know, all he knew was that as a group of prisoners came by, giving him a mug of water, he swore to himself that he would do everything he could to survive. Some of the prisoners had talked of trying to revolt, but he wasn't going to even indulge the idea. To Tartarus with the war and continuing the fight, he just wanted to go home.\n\nAs the bell rang again he pushed himself up, raising his pickaxe again to the sound of the cracking whip."

"There's still some fight left in Equestria, and we Apples will lead the wa-hey!" she protested as Big Mac came up and took the musket from her. "You give me that gun back right this instant, Big Mac!" \n\n"Nope," the giant stallion said evenly, blocking her path as Applejack came hurrying to his side. "We've been over this granny, and you ain't going nowhere," he told her, him and Applejack both gently taking her under one leg each to drag her inside again.\n\n"You're all seduced by that dark queen, I tell you!" Granny Smith hollered, "But there's still life in the Apple family! Celestia is not forgotten, and we Apples will fight to the end, we're Apples to the core!"\n\n"I'm telling you, we're not going to war again!" Applejack said, silently dreading the fate that was awaiting them all. This was going to be her life from now on, wasn't it? "The war's over, and we have a farm to run!" she told her grandmother frantically\n\n "The Apples remember!" Granny Smith yelled in response, waving her hoof in the air.\n\nAbout an hour later, the situation was resolved, and Big Mac and Applejack were both slouched over the kitchen table, just as Apple Bloom came home from school. Seeing her siblings at the table, she slowly put away her bags before speaking up. "Granny?" she asked, Big Mac looking up at her.\n\n"Eyyup...""   
lunas.44.d_2:0 "Ponies put different levels of importance on family. To some, family was a group of ponies you had a blood bond with, but not much more. To others, it was your close friends and confidantes. Yet to the Apples, family was everything. Family stuck together, through thick and thin, and it didn't matter what happened; you were there for them. Didn't matter that that was what Nightmare Moon was counting on, the Apples took care of each other.\n\n"You got the eastern fields?" Applejack asked curtly as she passed by Big Mac. Her brother gave a quick grunt in response, trudging under his own burdens. They barely talked these days, there was too much to do. The farm that once had been filled with cheer and homeliness was now a silent, dour place, bereft of cheer. Ponies didn't come by to visit as much as they used to, and when they did, they received little in the way of a warm welcome. The Apples didn't have time for those who weren't family any longer, not after so many of them had been taken hostage by Nightmare Moon.\n\nFamily came first, Applejack couldn't change that. A knife was held against her family's throat, and in a situation like that family was the only thing that mattered. She had kept herself apart from her friends, knowing that interacting with them was dangerous. She didn't have anything to prove, she couldn't. Her family came first, and if she had to stay away from the others and do her job, she would do it. It didn't matter that Nightmare Moon was an evil tyrant, not to the level where it was more important than family. Her friends had been the best thing that had happened to her, but that didn't mean she could value them higher than her own flesh and blood.\n\nWas that it, then, somepony had asked.

Part of her wanted to yell at them for the harebrained idea they had gotten, but it was a very small part that she did not want to indulge. Instead she explained as calmly as she could. "Bats make for terrible pets. They are born to fly about and hunt insects, or find fruit. Caging them will make them miserable and lonely, and they like to cuddle each other more than ponies."\n\n"Huh, that's a real shame," Filthy Rich said thoughtfully, "I was hoping to find some way to make an impression on the nouveau rich thestrals, but that seems to be the wrong way."\n\n"We have the money, no?" Spoiled Rich remarked. "Just hire somepony to manage a larger enclosure for them."\n\n"They also stink," Fluttershy pointed out. "In order to mark their scent, they rub themselves - as well as places around them - with their urine — several times a day."\n\nAny further discussion was unnecessary at this point, and the pair yielded on the topic. After a brief further discussion they departed, and Fluttershy could give up a small sigh of relief. This was the fourth pony this week who had asked about bats as pets. It was good that ponies were less scared of bats, but this idea of having them as pets was just absurd to her. So many ponies still didn't understand animals, especially not animals as special as bats.\n\nA sudden knock on the door startled her, and she walked to see who it was. It was not somepony she knew. Instead it was a tall, gangly batpony wearing a cloak and a monocle. He towered above her, staring down at her with an intense gaze that made her almost recoil, before he pointed at her.\n\n"You are vorthy!" he exclaimed, taking out a stamp from the cloak and slamming it into her doorframe to leave a bat-shaped mark on it. "My children vill find shelter vith you, take good care of them!" With that, he turned around and left just as a swarm of bats came from the trees, flying straight into her house in a torrent of shrieking and fluttering."

Without employment, he couldn't pay the bills, and he was left having to move out. In the end, Fluttershy was the only family left, and she was stuck having to house him. She tried to look at it from a good angle. He wasn't as insufferable as he used to be, but he just never stopped complaining. About her home, about the animals, about whenever he needed to help out; it was a constant stream of whining, and she had had enough.\n\n"Shut up!" she suddenly yelled, spinning around and throwing the bucket of rabbit food into the ground. "What is wrong with you?!" she screamed at the top of her lungs "Why, why do you have to always whine like this?! Why are you such an entitled horseapple?! Why are you walking free when mom and dad are hostages with Nightmare Moon?! Of all the ponies, why you!?" Turning around, she stormed back to the house as everything just became too much for her. It was an hour later, as she lay curled up on her bed, that she heard the door open slowly. She didn't look up, not even when she heard hoofsteps come closer to her.\n\n"I'm sorry," Zephyr Breeze said as he stood by her bedside. "I messed this up again I guess. I just... when I lived with you, you handled me so easily, I... I guess I just wanted to give you something else to think about. Something easy." Slowly, Fluttershy looked up at him, blinking through her tears. Zephyr hung his head in shame.\n\n"Zephyr... I can't do this," she told him. "I'm not strong, I'm terrified. I cry myself to sleep every night. Please..."\n\n"I won't say a word again," Zephyr promised her. "Should... I give the animals makeovers instead?" he asked suddenly, provoking a small smile from Fluttershy at the thought. Slowly, Zephyr moved to embrace her, Fluttershy reciprocating."

Aren't they supposed to be in season?! Scratch that, don't we have freezers anymore?!"\n\n"It's just that we're struggling to get deliveries," the clerk apologized, "everything else is going fine, but berries are chronically missing."\n\n"Good riddance," a voice said airily behind her, and Pinkie looked back to see one of the newcomers in town, a haughty batpony by the name of Lidded Jar. "Berries are overrated nonsense."\n\n"WHAT?!" Pinkie exclaimed in disbelief. "A-a-are you crazy?! Berries are vital to make a good cake! The balance of fruity and sweet are what makes a good cake what it is!\n\n"If you need fruity, why not use... fruit?" Lidded Jar asked. "Berries don't provide anything that you can't get from good fruit except wasted space."\n\n"I mean... fruit is fine, but it's not nearly as sweet! Besides, if you have to chop them up, they'll leak across the cake. You'd have to prepare them, and then why not just use berries instead?" Pinkie was about to have a mental breakdown. What was she talking about? What was this insane notion, this twisted farce?\n\n"Suuure, stay with with the foals of you want to, leave the fruits to the adults."\n\n"That's it!" Pinkie exclaimed. "We'll settle this the right way! I challenge you to a bake-off!" she yelled, dramatically pointing at Lidded Jar, whose eyes narrowed.\n\n"You are on, berry-muncher," she growled. "Just don't cry when I prove you wrong."\n\n"That's my line," Pinkie retorted, the two mares glaring each other down."
lunas.46.d_2:0 "There was so much to do when raising two young foals. While they weren't quite the hellions they had been when they were babies, Pound and Pumpkin were still energetic like you wouldn't believe. If they played, it seemed to be a given that they would be running around at full speed, and avoiding running into things and tipping them over was more of a suggestion than anything else. They were also really peculiar about their food! Pumpkin couldn't stand when the peas touched the mashed potatoes, and if Pound Cake saw even a trace of onions in the food, he'd throw a tantrum!\n\nAll that wasn't a problem, though, not really. Over time, Pinkie had learned how to manage them pretty well. When you knew their quirks, you could adapt. Make sure the food was well divided up and use a mixer for the onions so they were invisible. Sure it was a long road, but she could deal with it. There was one thing she couldn't deal with though: when they asked where mommy or daddy was.\n\nShe'd tried to deflect it for the longest time. She'd told them mommy and daddy 'were away on a long trip', and though it hadn't been a good answer, it had at least been one. It had let her avoid the question that burned in her day and night, how were the Cakes doing? The insidiousness of Nightmare Moon's actions had made it go from terrible to nearly unbearable; had taken the parents, but not the children, leaving Pinkie to tend the kids who had lost their parents because of her.\n\nTonight though, the answer wasn't enough. When Pinkie had come in to read them a bedtime story, Pumpkin had refused to listen, telling her loudly, over and over again, that she wanted her mommy. Pound had soon begun to tear up as well, and Pinkie was left with two desperate children who cried at the top of their lungs, begging her for their mommy and daddy. But mommy and daddy weren't coming, no matter how much they asked, and all they had was her, the reason they were gone."

Should she go a bit more daring, or keep it conservative? Rarity was mulling the question over, leaning back in her seat, when she suddenly realized something, sighing deeply.\n\nWas she a bad pony? She knew her friends still struggled after the civil war, some of them deeply. So many ponies had been hurt, and struggled to rebuild their lives. Some never would get back all that they had lost. And yet here she was, selling dresses to the high society ponies. With the recent changes, there were plenty of newly monied thestrals who wanted to indulge in the world of fashion, and many came to her. Business was booming for her, and she had even managed to hire a pair of new tailors to help her out... it felt shameful, like she was exploiting the suffering of others around her.\n\nBut what more could she do? She made sure to funnel her profits into clothing the orphaned and the homeless. Her positive interactions with the batponies helped mend the rifts in society to some small extent, and she had made a point of serving everypony equally. What else could a pony do in these days? She didn't know, but she knew it still felt wrong somehow.\n\nShe should go with a more daring cut. Her client wasn't a very meek pony, and she'd want to flaunt what she had. Also, if the client was really happy, maybe she'd be more open to joining in a charity drive for those who had suffered after the war? Rarity couldn't think of much else to do, but she knew she had to do something." 
lunas.47.d_2:0 "Sapphires and amethysts for the dress, deep azure for the fabric, and of course, plenty of lace of course, exactly what the customer had wanted. No time to think about anything but this, she'd promised to deliver it today, and as Celestia was her... or, well, by golly she would have it done! Moving directly from the drawing table to the workdesk, she started marking out the shapes she'd need out of the cloth and picking up the scissors to cut it out. It was only a couple of minutes before she was already by the sewing machine, working as fast as she could. After all, plenty to do, plenty to do! No time to stop and no time to let the mind drift!\n\nBit by bit, she stitched it together and by six in the afternoon she had a stunning, somewhat daring dress finished.

When she left, Rarity instantly turned to cleaning up the store, making sure to put every last little thing exactly where it needed to be, down to the last needle!\n\nIt was all in vain. When she went to bed she was exhausted, but not enough that she could keep her mind from drifting. Clutching her pillow over her head, she tried to block out the thoughts of Sweetie Belle.\n\nHer one and only sister, locked up by that vile queen of darkness! What was she going to do!? Something, anything! Infiltrate the palace, steal her away to flee far away, the Riverlands, Zebrica, somewhere! But no... they'd murder her friends' families! What was she going to do!?\n\nOnce again, she didn't have any answer, and though she tossed and turned, sobbing into her pillow, she knew that tomorrow would be the same; a day of mad scramble to try to tire herself out and not think and a night of trying to push it away."

This one could eat a massive horseapple.\n\nIt was over a decade now that she and her friends had had their first encounter with Nightmare Moon. During it, Rainbow Dash remembered how Nightmare Moon had taunted her, teasing her with the idea of joining the Shadowbolts, the lunar equivalent of the Wonderbolts. It all was a bit of a haze to her still, as she remembered how it had been all dream-like, and the entire issue of Nightmare Moon seemed so distant. Logic hadn't made sense in that dream, but her loyalty to her friends had. Otherwise... maybe she would have fallen for it?\n\nSo why was this whole thing coming crashing down on her again?\n\nStaring at the letter she had gotten, she read the text over again: 'Owing to your documented skill as a flyer, as well as your previous services, the Imperial Shadowbolts wish to extend their invitation for you to serve as an instructor in their ranks'...\n\n"Gaaaaaah!" yelling out loud, she burst into the air, flying as fast as she could away across the sky. Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid! The Wonderbolts were gone and her dream was in the dirt. She'd only barely been able to accept that, and yet now this stupid offer had to come crashing down in front of her to ruin what little peace she'd found!\n\nShe could do it, she could be one of the high-flyers again. She could even be an instructor! She'd have what she'd dreamed of after all. But the Shadowbolts, seriously!? Did they really think that she was going to sell out that much?!\n\nAfter about an hour she landed back home and stormed into the house, exhausted.

Not a chance, she'd puke like a hose. Slowly getting to her hooves, she wobbled a bit and steadied herself against the wall before walking into the kitchen.

It was there she did the mistake of staring into her reflection. She was a mess... she couldn't keep doing this, she knew it. At some point, she was going to be reduced to a shell of a pony. She'd already made the mistake of drinking when she knew she was going to work the next day, and now she suffered the consequences. She needed to start trying again.\n\nTrying for what, though? Her friends had been separated from each other by fear that Nightmare Moon would see their gatherings as a threat and kill one of her hostages. Her family was gone, even Scootaloo had been dragged off, and all that left was what? At least the cider let her have a moment of peace. She'd always loved the buzz, but now it was basically all she had to look forward to.\n\nSighing deeply, she leaned forward over the sink and thought to herself how disappointed everypony would be in her now. This had to stop, or at least... be curtailed? She could still drink, but it had to be weekends only? Yes, that was at least something.

He had tried to keep on a brave face, but he was feeling sick to his stomach. Opening the door to the dark bedroom, he slipped inside and came up to Twilight's bed. With a small climb, he got up to put the tray on her nightstand and gently pulled the blanket down to reveal Twilight's haggard face.\n\n"Wakey wakey," he said as he gently shook her shoulder and reached for the bowl. "I've got dinner, it's daisy soup!" It seemed to take all the strength Twilight had to push herself up - with some help from him - and take the spoon. Her face was just blank as she ate. No comments about the food, no praise, nothing. After half the bowl she slowed down, and Spike gently urged her on. "Come on, just a little more, Twilight." Twilight only shook her head, and Spike smiled. "It's okay," he assured her, putting the bowl on the bedside. "Do you want to go to the library? I could get you a book if you want one."\n\n"No..."

Twilight was devastated after Celestia was banished and all she knew had fallen apart, and all he could do was cook food. The girls came by as much as they could, but he was the one who was here. Slowly, he felt the disappointment at himself grow, and before he could stop himself a small sob came out. Forcing himself to stop, he cleared his throat. "Well, I'll go do the dishes and..."

If you rebel, or if you move against me, I will have them die in the most horrific fashion possible. Your parents, your relatives, your friends, I have acquired several hostages for each of you, and I will not be above killing one of them if you are trying my patience. Now bow, and swear that you will never raise a hoof against me ever again. Unless you need me to prove that I am serious..." She let the question hang in the air, leaving the six mares to slowly, reluctantly, bow to her, giving her their oaths."

lunas.51.d:0 "The stallion had been escorted to the palace in secrecy, meeting Nightmare Moon herself not in the throne room, but in a distant corner of the palace, away from prying ears. He was a tall, lanky stallion dressed in a poncho and a wide-brimmed hat. He would have projected mystery and a hint of danger, was it not for the rubber chicken sitting on his back.\n\n"So tell me, stallion, are the rumours of your skills true? I hear is that you are the greatest in your profession across the Empire."\n\n"My accomplishments speak for themselves, your majesty." The stallion answered calmly, his voice low, almost growling, "I've yet to fail even once. Tell me what you need done, and I will accomplish it."\n\n"My subjects celebrate Nightmare Night, yet it is a joke. They dress themselves as whatever childish, frightening thing they can find and leap out from corners, yelling 'booh'. They gather candy and laugh about petty scares. It is silly and it is insufficient to celebrate their empress. I want to see it reinvented into a night for the glory of the empire, see them gathered not for foalish goofs, but for a night of wonders and manic joy. I want it to be a night that surpasses all others, where the music does not stop until the light of dawn, if even then! Can you do this?" she asked, looking to the stallion, whose eyes had widened.\n\n"Can I ever!" he exclaimed, his voice rising in pitch. "I'm seeing parade floats down the streets, where each city block can come together to compete about the greatest one! There should be masquerade competitions too, with masks! Dressing as the "Spirit of Nightmare Night" to be as glamorous as they can be! Competitions to see who can come up with the craziest stunts to shock and thrill the audience! It'll be a night of mad wonders, your majesty, one that they'll never forget!" He was almost bouncing up and down, quivering with eagerness to get to work. Nightmare Moon smiled to herself. Finally, her night would become what it deserved to be."

lunas.52.t:0 "A Tale Of Two Sisters"
lunas.52.d:0 "The old stallion before her had every eye in the throne room on him, and the gathered ponies' reactions to his plea ranged from surprise to rage and - in Nightmare Moon's case - amusement. The temerity of what he suggested was beyond what she had expected, and she found it amusing enough that she began to laugh, throwing her head back in mirth.\n\n"Of all the things that I expected my sister's old lackeys to try, this was not one of them. You amuse me, and I will let you justify WHY I would be so foalish to permit my subjects to worship my sister alongside me before I have you thrown in the dungeon.\n\n"Your return to Equestria a decade ago was unprecedented," the old stallion responded calmly, the very image of confidence. "And much of the knowledge of you was relegated to myths. Thanks to this, your loyalists remained hidden and their beliefs unmonitored. If you wish to ensure the stability of your realm, I humbly plead with you to permit your subjects to give praise to your sister, and to let them do so openly. They will have less reason to resent you, and you will be able to keep a closer eye on them."\n\n"Tell me, was it this audacity that saw you attempt to coup my sister's student and her school, Neighsay?" Nightmare Moon asked, staring the former head of the EEA down.\n\n"I do what I must to ensure the stability of my homeland, your majesty," Neighsay answered plainly. "I defied your sister to do so, and I challenge you now. Punish me as you see fit, your Majesty, but I beg you to consider my proposal.""

Ever since the fall of the old order, Nightmare Night has become arguably the most important holiday in the Empire. Unlike previously, it is now a night of wild celebration and parades throughout all the cities and towns. Grand parade floats depicting local heroes and legends as well as her majesty roll down the main streets, cider and wine flows freely and music and dancing fills the night as the masked ponies compete about who can be the most glamorous and exciting.\n\nUnlike the old Nightmare Night, which was about fright and relief, manic joy characterizes these celebrations as the ponies show their adoration for their Empress. The wild partying rages on throughout the Empire until dawn, when the exhausted partygoers finally collapse onto their - or maybe someone else's - beds. There's no guarantees, and fewer and fewer really care. After all what happens during Nightmare Night stays in Nightmare Night."

lunas.54.d:0 "The shackled prisoners were surrounded by heavily armed guards, all of them forced to lie down in supplication for her majesty as she entered the throne room. Seating herself on the throne, she sat silently as a secretary read out the charges levied against the gathered ponies. Aiding and abetting "the fallen sister" of Her Majesty, murdering the loyal servants of Nightmare Moon and betraying the rightful ruler of the Lunar Empire. Each of the crimes were severe, and there could be no forgiveness for them.\n\n"How do you plead?" Nightmare Moon asked the gathered crowd, leading to one of them, Soarin, standing up.\n\n"We never swore anything to you, and we are no traitors!" He yelled. "Punish us for those other things, but we are-ack!" In a heartbeat, Nightmare Moon's horn started glowing as she grabbed him by the throat, squeezing him to force him down to the ground again.\n\n"Remember your place, worm!" Nightmare Moon snapped. "You live and you die at my sufferance, all of you do! I am the Queen of the Night, the God-Empress of this nation! My sister spared the rod, and spoiled the foals, but I will not repeat her mistake! You have raised your hooves against your rightful Goddess, and you are more than criminals, you are sinners!" Spreading her wings wide, she towered above the ponies with cold fire in her eyes. "This is no trial, it is an inquisition. Your sins are without question, and you will rot for it! Never again shall you see neither sun nor moon, and until your dying days, you will regret taking up arms against me! The one refuge you will have is death, and your miserable, wasting existence will stand as a testament to the depth of your sins!"

Ponies of the four tribes bustled about, browsing the latest in Lunar fashion. She quickly found Rarity in the stockroom.\n\n"If this is about making uniforms, I won't do it. Civilian clothing only." Rarity said, barely looking up from her work.\n\nNightmare Moon sighed, "The war is over, Rarity."\n\nRarity flinched, levitating a box towards Nightmare Moon. "YOUR war. Have you seen my latest line? My customers were overjoyed."\n\nNightmare Moon looked suspiciously "These are old, soiled clothes! I have no patience for your jests."\n\nRarity turned, finally meeting her gaze. "For the war orphans."\n\nNightmare Moon warred, fury and sorrow battling for control. "And what of the thestrals who suffered for centuries and Celestia's unwillingness to help? Justice has been done, and we must move forward." Her voice softened "Rarity, you may not agree with my methods, but what about Friendship? What about the good of Equestria? The thestrals are free but we are a nation divided. We need symbols. Respected ponies, hooves in both old Equestria and the New Lunar Empire. We need you."\n\n"Friendship? You killed my friend and you speak of friendship?!"\n\nNightmare Moon grew angry, "She is no more dead than I was when Luna ruled! Watch!" Her face rippled, her catlike pupils rounding, her mane lightening. "I'm sorry Rarity. I... We... need you. This is not the Nightmare Moon of old. We rule together. Help me temper her strength and will with your kindness and generosity."\n\nRarity stared as Luna faded, tears streaming down her face. "I...I will.""

Once, they had worn fancy clothing befitting of their high-ranking positions, but now they were stripped bare and made to kneel before their mistress. Yet their mistress was not necessarily a cruel one, especially when she could benefit from benevolence. While they had aided her treacherous older sibling during the war, perhaps they could yet be redeemed. The companies they owned employed many talented workers and owned many facilities, after all, which could benefit the Lunar Empire greatly.\n\nOf course, on the other hoof the companies could simply be dissolved and their assets confiscated, and the industrialists themselves thrown into the deepest dungeons, but without the skill and experience of the concerns their facilities couldn't be utilized to their full potential.\n\nWhat is the Empress' decision?"

lunas.58.t:0 "The Position Of Warmaster"
lunas.58.d:0 "As the civil war consumes Equestria, it has been decreed by the Empress that the Imperial army must fight as one. We are no longer rag-tag groups of supporters fighting with guerilla tactics, we must be a single united force. On the recommendation of our advisors from Chiropterra, we shall call a conclave of our most experienced commanders to appoint a Warmaster for the Army. This Warmaster will be in charge of determining our nation's doctrine and craft our warfare style to their will. So as the conclave drags on, four plans have come out on top.\n\nFirst is Marshal Speck. Speck has received the most conventional military training out of the four candidates and favors warfare similar to the fledgling Equestrian army, with planning and logistics being essential for its conduct.\n\nSecond is Selenite. An extremely young officer, but fanatically loyal, Selenite has stated that the lives of the lunar faithful are too valuable for the war tactics of old to be used. She suggests to take full advantage of the new wonders of modern weaponry and refine it into a storm of iron and gunpowder. She argues her strategies save lives and are more effective in the modern era.\n\nThird is General Tempest Wind. Much like Selenite, Wind's doctrine is rooted in the reality of modern war, but approaches it from a different direction. Tempest says that the weapon that shall win the wars of the second millennium is the tank. After studying both the Stalliongradian and Changeling militaries, she has stated that their heresy aside, their ideas on war are worth adopting as our own.\n\nLast comes Midnight Oil. He bluntly declares that the Empire has two resources that it can use to emerge victoriously. It's large supply of ponypower, and its near unrivalled industrial capacity. He has combined this with his own theories about the nature of warfare regarding large front operations. Some call his doctrines barbaric, he calls them effective."

lunas.59.d:0 "From one end of the harbour to the other, ships sat in close rows ranging from small destroyers to the massive ship that towered above them all from its position in front of Nightmare Moon. She was splendid, a steel titan to rule the waves and lead the Lunar Royal Navy. She watched the massive guns, wondering just how devastating they would be when they tore into her enemies. They would break any lesser ship in half, and the armour made this behemoth nigh invulnerable to anything but the most sustained barrages. She was a true empress of the sea, and her name - the LRM Nightmare - fit it perfectly."
lunas.59.a:0 "Go forth and seize the seas!"

lunas.60.t:0 "Freedom Of Speech Or Freedom From Speech?"
lunas.60.d:0 "One of the big issues before Her Majesty is how much freedom should be given to her subjects in terms of speech. Many, especially her Chiropterran advisors, have suggested the full abolishment of these so-called 'liberties'. They are subjects, and they only need to say and think what Her Majesty decides. To allow needless expression would be to allow dissent.\n\nMeanwhile, Light Narrative - a former Disciple - has pleaded with her majesty to permit her subjects to speak freely. Better to hear their concerns in public media than first when things boil over, he advises.\n\nThe entire issue is highly contentious, and in the end, the choice is Her Majesty's."

This ban extends to all forms of it, be it anarchism, libertarian or authoritarian socialism or any other ideas based on or derived from the writings of Caramel Marks or his ilk. Membership in or activities in the service of any socialist organization will carry a jail sentence of up to 30 years. This includes any sort of teaching or propagation of socialist ideas, possession or distribution of socialist literature as well as the implementation of socialist principles anywhere in the nation.\n\nReferencing the existence of Stalliongrad as an example, Nightmare Moon has made it abundantly clear that she will not permit such aberrations to arise in her empire, and that unlike her sister, she will not hesitate to bring the full wrath of the Lunar Empire down on whoever attempts to spread this poison among her subjects."

lunas.62.t:0 "A Lesson From Severyana"
lunas.62.d:0 "As the issue of Stalliongrad and its errant political ideology was addressed, it jogged a memory in Nightmare Moon, a memory older than unified Equestria itself. Before the reign of the two sisters, the nobles of the Severyana region were famously firm with their subjects, and one of their methods of controlling their people was to keep the production and distribution of alcohol under their firm hoof. Not only did it help to fill their coffers, but they also could restrict its consumption to taverns and the likes, to control the population. The concept had fascinated Luna back then, yet Celestia had refused to make use of this policy as they ascended. Now, that the Empress of the Night rules alone, the question has come whether it is time to make use of this idea after all."

All the same though, they are being implemented, and while change will be slow, it will be inexorable. It may take a year, it may take ten, but the empire will be reshaped according to Nightmare Moon's vision. After all, she has eternity."

lunas.64.t:0 "The Fourth Tribe"
lunas.64.d:0 "The thestrals were always there, even in time immemorial, yet they were not viewed as equal to the other ponies thanks to their lack of a role in the three tribes system, and instead they became outcasts. Some, like the sun princess, might have claimed they were still part of Equestria, but the thestrals found more kinship with Luna than with her, and when Luna rose against Celestia, they followed the only princess who had taken them seriously. Their reward was a thousand years of exclusion, during which they endured, and remembered.\n\nNo longer will the thestrals be viewed as lesser, or as outcasts. They are the ponies closest to Her Majesty, having proved their loyalty through ten centuries as well as two of the most cataclysmic wars Equestria has ever seen. This is no mere hollow praise either, as Nightmare Moon has made sure to sign their status into law. They will never want for food, shelter or care again, the lands taken from them during the last ten centuries will be returned to them (forcefully if needed) and from now on until the end of time, they are the ones who hold the highest status in Equestria instead of the flighty and self-absorbed three tribes."

lunas.65.d:0 "Gazing out of the window in her chambers, Nightmare Moon enjoyed the first calm night in who knew how long. In the time after her triumph she had been working tirelessly to bring order to her empire, and things were finally calming down. Tomorrow would bring new issues and worries, yet for now she had pushed past the first mountain of challenges. She was the Empress of the Lunar Empire, unquestioned and unchallenged, and yet she found herself pensive.\n\nFor all of her existence in this form, she had struggled, and now she found herself reflecting on what had passed. She didn't regret her actions, never had. She would never have meekly cowed before the unjust world. She took what she deserved, by force if needed, yet there was more to it than that. The thestrals, HER little ponies, deserved more than what the world had dealt them as well, and Celestia had stood in the way of that. When push came to shove, Celestia's Equestria had hated her thestrals too much, and in response Nightmare Moon had crushed them all.\n\nBut could things have turned out differently? She did not know, and it vexed her. After all the minutiae of politics and statecraft that she had gone through, so much of what Celestia had done made sense to her, and with the understanding came doubt in her own actions. She did not regret what she had done still, but maybe... maybe she was regretting the necessity.\n\nIn the east, dawn was slowly approaching, and Nightmare Moon felt a sudden, strange sensation: loneliness. As the sun slowly rose over the horizon, she silently wondered if - a thousand years from now - Celestia would be able to finally understand. This age was a bloody one, Nightmare Moon knew that well, but in the end, Equestria would finally be safe, safer than Celestia ever had managed to make it. The Iron Hoof was not a failure, it was a necessity, and her actions would prove her right."

It was a luxury to be able to simply roam like this, one that she chose to cherish. Her existence until this point had been one of furious struggling, and now she had a moment to think about all that had happened up until this point. Looking to the windows, she saw the stained glass depictions in them; her first battle, her fall and the loyal thestrals that remained, her return and subsequent victory. Her life was laid out for her, and as she looked from the first to the third window, she thought about the difference between then and now.\n\nDuring the first war she had been blinded by rage and hurt pride, too focused on vengeance and not enough on victory. Yet now, a thousand years later, her loyal servants had shown her the key to victory. Blind zeal and rage led nowhere, instead victory belonged to those cold and calculating enough to know how to seize it. When realizing that cruelty and kindness were sides of the same coin, she had finally understood what she needed to do in order to establish her reign.\n\nThe fourth window and beyond were not yet filled, and she wondered what scenes that would fill it. Equestria would need to be fully united, down to the last little breakaway, and she would do so no matter what it took. How did one deal with the errant ponies the most effectively though? The windows would show how she had gone about it. And after that? There were forces beyond the borders of her empire that would threaten her domain. The changelings were a danger, always had been, and the griffons in the east would stop tearing each other apart sooner or later.\n\nThere was only one way to meet this threat; move first. All of Equus would bow to her: first then her would reign be secured. Such was the role of an Empress, and she was done failing."

Celestia and her sycophants, the element bearers who had thwarted her the last time, the countless fools who thought they could challenge the rightful ruler of Equestria. They were all broken before her!\n\nLaughing to herself, she closed her eyes and leaped into the dreamworld, eager for the night's entertainment. The ponies out there who secretly resented her thought they were so clever, but they forgot who they were dealing with. She was Nightmare Moon, the mistress of their dreamscapes and ruler of their sleep, and nopony escaped her wrath!\n\nIt was not even a matter of warfare, the battles would come. For now, she was moving through the dreamworld, spreading nightmares for her own personal amusement.\n\nPonies waking up gasping in fear after they felt their eyes turn to worms, whimpering as they were chased by some nameless horror through endless corridors, crying as they saw their homes and all they loved burn to cinders before their eyes.\n\nHer laughter only rose in intensity as she revelled in the terror and the panic that spread through them. Even when they woke up, they'd know that the Empress knew of them, and that they were never safe. Her secret police was hunting them already, and would find them in the end. The question was just whether their nightmares would have driven them mad before then.\n\nAfter all, what was the point of all her power if she could not enjoy herself?"

Of course this time around, the casinos will be asked to pay their proper due." #Forgiving
lunas.69.d_2:0 "The forces of Las Pegasus have been crushed, and the city is under Her Majesty's control. Local authority figures have been rounded up and made to swear allegiance to the Empress.

They are pitiable, yet proud, and Nightmare Moon has found them pliable as well. Appearing before their tribal elders in all her glory, she has offered them guarantees for the eternity of her rule. This comes with a caveat, however, in that they will swear eternal fealty to her - the moon goddess - and serve her whenever she calls upon them. The buffalo, exhausted, have agreed, as it is at least a clear guarantee." #Forgiving

Unwilling to let this cause problems in the future, the government has organized a series of reservations across the south, where the buffalo will be confined in manageable groups.

Without their forces, it is doubtful whether Her Majesty's return would have been as successful as it was, and Nightmare Moon is aware of this. Siphoning resources from the rest of Equestria, especially assets seized from solar loyalists, she has ordered these funds invested in the southeast. Not only will this serve as a fine reward for their servitude, but it will also ensure that the region can serve as a loyalist stronghold in the future as well." #Neutral
lunas.72.d_3:0 "The thestrals of the southeast have lived largely outside of Equestrian society for centuries, and few places has seen more tension between the two groups than the southeast. In many places, the tribes have been in active confrontation with Equestrian settlers and economic interests, and many times they have lost. Now, the hour of vengeance is at hoof, as Nightmare Moon has told her people to take back what was theirs. Private companies across the southeast are being seized, estates razed and their occupants chased out as the thestrals restore the southeast to what it was meant to be; their home and a place where other ponies only live at their sufferance." #Vengeful

lunas.73.t:0 "The Prodigal Children"
lunas.73.d_1:0 "As Light Narrative entered the room, Nightmare Moon was busy reading a newspaper, barely glancing up from it as he came up to her and bowed deeply.\n\n"You are a prolific writer, Light Narrative," she said after a while, putting down the paper - The Stableside Bugle - on the table. "It is amusing that this has carried over so well to your skill as a commander. I have the reports, and you don't need to justify yourself. I do, however, want to hear why you fight. I find your writings quite mellow, hardly telling of a faithful lunarist."\n\n"Well your majesty," Light Narrative began, having removed his hat in her presence, "I always was blessed with an ability to see the bigger picture. Spent most of my time writing for my people's cause, but the more I wrote the more I realized there never was any overlap between the propaganda of the old regime and the reality my people lived. The princess had a thousand years to fix it and didn't, so when everything blew up I had to stand by my people."\n\n"Would you have served Celestia instead if she had been more tolerant of the thestrals?" Nightmare Moon asked, deciding to prod a little at him. Where was the zeal? Where was the hatred?\n\n"No," Light Narrative answered plainly. "I fight for my people. You're the only one who have cared for them. Maybe I'd forgive her, but never serve."\n\n"And what of the other ponies, then?" Nightmare Moon continued, content with his answer. "They are the ones who have caused your people the most pain. What do we do with them?"\n\n"Well..." Light began, "half measures aren't going to do anything but anger them. My people are a proof of that. Either we kill them all, or we learn from their mistakes, and created an Empire where they too have a place. I'm leaning towards the latter," he finished somewhat dryly.\n\n"Good," Nightmare Moon said. "Zealots come thirteen a dozen. I need ponies like you, who think further, and fight to build a greater nation. I hope that your people can serve in the same way."" #Forgiving
lunas.73.d_2:0 "Stars Whirl kneeled before her, Nightmare Moon studied the unicorn. What a history this pony had. Bereft of chances within the Equestrian military, she had chosen to stand with the lunarists as the world came crashing down. In that position, she had even become the supreme commander of the south. It was impressive, the stuff of legends or novels, and yet here the pony stood before her.\n\n"Tell me, Stars Whirl, why did you fight for me?" she asked the unicorn. "You had an officer's commission under my sister. Why abandon all that?"\n\n"I'm a soldier," Stars Whirl replied. "Fighting is my job, but under Celestia's rule we were park rangers and guards. Even as we were threatened or indeed invaded, we were supposed to sit pretty and let Celestia's student handle everything."\n\n"I can hear your resentment," Nightmare Moon chuckled. "When was it that you broke? When did you turn your back on my sister?"\n\n"June 1005," Stars Whirl told her "Yakyakistan was about to declare war on Equestria over what they thought a diplomatic insult: that we did not perfectly emulate their customs when greeting their delegation. Celestia's student and her friends were run ragged and barely managed to solve it, but I wondered what I even was doing, if a pack of mountain savages could bully us into submission like that. My service was a joke, and Equestria's pride rubbed into the dirt. When your agents approached me, I couldn't say no."\n\n"How cute," Nightmare Moon said, walking down to her and reaching out to raise her face, meeting Stars Swirl's gaze. "What do you imagine serving me will accomplish, then?"\n\n"Strength, your majesty," Stars Whirl replied. "I am a soldier, and I will serve wherever you need, be it against ponies or other species. My only desire is that we never again have to bow to anycreature else."\n\n"That will depend on your service, Field Marshal Stars Whirl," Nightmare Moon told her, smirking. "Rise, and serve your Empress."" #Neutral
lunas.73.d_3:0 "The thestral threw himself to the ground before her in supplication, Nightmare Moon towering above him. Of all the thestrals in the south, few had expressed a zeal like Starry Glory, and she wanted to see him for herself.\n\n"I have heard of you, Starry Glory," she said as she walked down from her throne towards him. "I hear how you desired to create a 'pure thestral state' in the southeast. How you railed against the Equestrians even after they imprisoned you. But tell me... beyond being a screaming demagogue, how are you going to serve your Empress?"\n\n"You are the Empress of all Equestria," Starry Glorry said, "But to thestralkind, you are our rightful goddess. Neither pegasus, unicorn or earth pony can ever be truly trusted. They are still your enemies, even if cowed. We, however, are your sword. We exist for you, to serve you and raise the glory of the Nightmare higher than any star in the sky." If his words were meant to convince, all they did was provoke uproarious laughter from Nightmare Moon.\n\n"Are you not implying your own failures there?" she asked him. "Are you thestrals really unable to keep order? Should I really trust my 'favoured servants' then?"\n\n"We will cow them, your majesty, ask me who you wish to deal with, and I shall present a plan."\n\n"The old high society ponies," Nightmare Moon asked.\n\n"Hold their foals as hostages to keep them calm. Make sure to indoctrinate the foals."\n\n"The dragons?"\n\n"Devastate their isles and line the shores with anti-aircraft batteries when they come seeking revenge."\n\n"The changelings?"\n\n"Make sure your intelligence operatives study their methods, kidnap and vivisect changelings if needed."\n\n"Very well," Nightmare Moon's grin had grown wider as he spoke. So he was not just all talk after all. "I accept your servitude, Starry Glory. But know that my favour is mine to give and withdraw. You are not special in service to me, nopony is." Starry Glory said nothing, simply bowing again to his empress and goddess." #Vengeful
lunas.73.d_4:0 "The thestrals prostrated themselves before Nightmare Moon as she watched the last, broken remains of her disciples. Despite their fervour, they had been crushed by the factions arrayed against them in the South-East. Their forces routed and many of their leaders executed, they were now a shadow of their former selves.\n\n"Pathetic," she said coldly, watching them squirm under her gaze. "Is this what you are offering me? A broken husk of an army with its head cut off and its limbs broken. Your finest, the commanders you all sang the praises of, were eviscerated like mice by a bird of prey. What good will these leftover scraps of flesh and bone do me?"\n\nSilence reigned in the throne room, and it was first after a while that anypony dared to speak up. A younger thestral in the back managed to get her quivering voice under control enough to speak.\n\n "Please, do not turn your gaze away from us." Her voice was quivering as she pleaded." We can still serve you, I swear!" she stopped, swallowing to clear the lump in her throat, and Nightmare Moon scoffed.\n\n"Plead as much as you wish," she told them, "I took you in when none else would. I watched over you as the world would destroy you. I entrusted you with securing my southern flank, and you failed!"\n\n"We will not fail you again, upon our lives we won't! If we fail you again, we will accept our lot, and you won't have to worry about punishing us, we will already be dead!" At her words, Nightmare Moon smirked to herself and spread her wings wide.\n\n"I accept your offering, disciples," she told them, having them precisely where she wanted them. "And I take you in not for your worth, but for your penance. Your lives, and your deaths, are mine. Arise, humiliated ones, for I will give you a new purpose.""  #Neutral except Stars Whirl died

lunas.74.t:0 "The Empress Of All Equus"
lunas.74.d_1:0 "It was done... Standing atop the balcony, Nightmare Moon looked out over the cheering crowds below as they sang her praises. The fighting was over, and Equus stood united under one great leader. The ponies of the Lunar Empire were now the unquestioned masters of the entire continent, and a night of a thousand years, a peaceful and prosperous one, was upon them. No longer would ponies be sedate grazers upon the golden fields of their homeland. Now they were sentinels, watching in the dark for anything that might threaten them or the peace through power that now reigned across all of Equus.\n\nAs she departed from the balcony, hearing them sing behind her, she held her head high. From Olenia to Nova Griffonia, the continent was now at peace. No more yak infighting, no more changeling aggression or socialist rabble-rousing. Her agents were hard at work across the continent, spreading her doctrine, and though some of the protectorates were still unruly, in time things would settle.\n\nShe remembered that fateful day when she first had returned, and all the woes that had befallen Equestria between then and the start of the civil war. Trial after trial, all only barely stopped by Celestia's agents, or simply by sheer luck. And all the while, her thestrals had still suffered, still been excluded.\n\nThe sun had slowly settled beyond the horizon in the west. A fitting symbolism... that was why she had held her speech at this time. Stopping to watch it, she thought once again of Celestia, sealed away within its fiery confines. Once, years ago, she had thought of Celestia and whether she would understand. Now this thought came to her again.\n\n"Our ponies are safe and secure," she said, half to herself, half to the distant sun. "The empire prospers and stands secure, and the thestrals you never could bring yourself to touch are cared for. When you return you will see, and until then, our ponies are mine to keep and safeguard. I never found peace in my banishment... but I hope that you may."" #Forgiving   
lunas.74.d_2:0 "The map was painted midnight blue from sea to sea, and Nightmare Moon smiled as she let the cameras take her image where she stood. Her wings stretched out so that each tip touched one end of the continent, a dramatic, but impactful image, and she would indulge the pageantry tonight. After all, why shouldn't she? She was now the mistress of all Equus, the one to have forged an empire greater than anything ponydom had seen. She stood atop the world, unchallenged.\n\nNow, however, came the true test of her mettle; holding onto it. Her sycophants and hooflickers claimed she had won, but this was merely the start. Her enemies were barely even cold in the ground, and countless creatures throughout her realm - empire and protectorates both - seethed with resentment at their new overlord. Beyond that, forces beyond Equus watched and waited for their chance as well. Oh no, this was merely the start.\n\nHer empire would need to encompass all facets of her subjects' lives, and unless they could not imagine any other state of affairs than being her subjects, her rule was still threatened. The seeds of Celestia's Equestria still remained out there, and they could sprout at any time. Celestia had had the right idea when dismissing the Mare in the Moon as an old pony's tale, but she had not gone far enough. Celestia's name would have to be expunged from the minds and legends of all ponies. Indeed the very idea of there being more than one alicorn had to be done away with. She would remain vigilant in the dream realm, never doubting for a second that dissent could spread anywhere, and her secret police would never stop chasing dissenters.\n\nHer reign would never be truly safe if she grew complacent, she knew that, and that was why she would have to work to make sure that nopony possessed a power equal to or which could threaten her. Others could try to threaten her reign, but from now until eternity, the Empress of the Night would remain vigilant." #Neutral 
lunas.74.d_3:0 "The throne room was packed with delegates from the conquered peoples of Equus. The Griffons, the Polar Bears, the Yaks, the Penguins, the Changelings, the Dragons and the Deer were all gathered in supplication before their Empress where she sat on her throne, savouring their submission. Species after species, one prouder than the other, all broken before her. It was almost intoxicating!\n\n"You don't seen particularly eager to honour your empress, khan," she remarked to the yak representative, who quietly bowed his head, even as his body trembled in rage. Watching him struggle with himself brought a wide grin to her face, and when he suddenly snapped, four guards already were upon him. Despite his size, he could do nothing as he was brutally beaten down, clasped in chains and dragged out of the throne room to the sound of her wild laughter.\n\nHer reign was complete, her power absolute, and her subjects' defiance only let her show the power she held over them all! She swept her gaze over the crowd, seeing them all avert their eyes after seeing what happened to the khan. They had had their chance to defeat the Empress of the Night, yet all had failed, and now they stood before her in bondage.\n\n"Why so gloomy?" she asked the others, "were you not here to pay respects to me, your eternal empress?!"\n\nFearful of a fate similar to the khan, the delegates continued to come before her to offer praise and their gifts, and Nightmare Moon leaned back to continue to savour it. Equus was hers, and the world was her playground. Whatever else she would do tomorrow, tonight she would revel in her victories as an Empress should." #Vengeful

With the influx of new knowledge brought on by the rise of the Lunar Empire and the total reformation of the navy, it had taken time to integrate them, yet now they stood before her, ready to serve.\n\nBloodwater: an audacious figure whom she suspected might as well have been a pirate considering his gumption and his ability to cut corners. Burning Straits: originally a mechanic whose file had been their writings about countering enemy aircraft. Polar Night; a severyanan exile of all things, yet promising and fanatically loyal all the same. Jungle Mango: definitely her top pick for commanding her carriers judging from what she had read on them. Flicker Fade: had already presented her with a draft of how to target the merchant fleet of a dozen potential future enemies.\n\nThese were the new generation naval officers in her realm, ponies who were elevated to their position by her word and had been pivotal in shaping the new, glorious navy of the Lunar Empire. There would be many more, but she watched them, resolved to remember this moment."

striped_pink_bat:0 "§gPrior to Luna's return Bipen was just living out her life in the jungles of south-eastern Equestria like an average batpony. Once Luna returned she joined her "guard", a militia of batponies that wanted to protect her.\n\nNow in the times of war and chaos Bipen can prove her worth to her princess by fighting the enemies of the Night. She also dreams of a bright future after the war where thestrals will be finally treated as equals with the Three Tribes.§!"
striped_pink_bat_except_not_lunarist_scum:0 "§gPrior to Luna's return Bipen was just living out her life in the jungles of south-eastern Equestria like an average batpony. Once Luna returned she joined her "guard", a militia of batponies that wanted to protect her.\n\nShe eagerly joined Luna's civil rights movement and participated in her campaigning. For all her efforts, she was rewarded with a high-ranking position in the Night Guard. Now, she is the Princess' most loyal guardian.§!"
NLR_selenite_desc:0 "Selenite was born on the 21st of December 980 ALB and was raised in a small town in the mountains of central Equestria. Despite excelling at most of the academic subjects at school she lived a fairly mundane foalhood, but once Luna returned she immediately moved to Canterlot and sought to serve her princess.\n\nBy the start of the year 1007 ALB, she's a leading armour officer in Equestria's first tank divisions. Whatever comes next for Equestria, Selenite will be sure to put her all towards loyally serving the Princess of the Night as well as fighting for an Equestria where all pony tribes live as equals.\n\nPortrait by Scroup"

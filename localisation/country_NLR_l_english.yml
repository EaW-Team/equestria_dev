NLR_iron_hoof:0 "A Firm Hoof"
NLR_iron_hoof_desc:0 "Our rule is fragile, at this moment, as the Loyalists that we are slowly beginning to rule over protest and attack our troops openly. If we were to let it be known that this kind of behaviour is not tolerated, the legitimacy of our rule would only get stronger."

NLR_engineer_corp:0 "Establish the Lunar Military Engineer Corps"

NLR_oil:0 "Oil Wells"
NLR_oil_desc:0 "With each passing day our oil issues become more and more apparent. Unfortunately, even trading for the oil is becoming a less viable option by the day.

NLR_civil_factory:0 "Expand Our Industry"

NLR_civil_factory_2:0 "Continue Expanding Our Industry"

NLR_reclemation_desc:0 "We've finally managed to beat Celestia's cronies, but many opportunistic traitors saw the civil war as a chance to create their own states following their own ideals. With Celestia's defeat, the time has come to deal with them."
NLR_conquer_VAN:0 "Retake Vanhoover"

NLR_work_for_freedom_desc:0 "The aftermath of the Civil War has resulted in our prisons being slightly overcrowded, however we have a brilliant solution for this issue. We can give the prisoners a more lenient sentence in exchange for doing hard labour, and reintegrating them into a new society."

NLR_destroyers_desc:0 "While battleships and carriers are nice and all, we need some smaller vessels to patroal the coasts and defend our ports."

NLR_marines:0 "Create the Lunar Marines"
NLR_marines_desc:0 "While ruling the waves on its own is a great advantage over any enemy, being able to invade from the sea that we own is the greatest advantage. A contingent of soldiers whose mission it is to storm beaches and capture coastlines will bring victory."
NLR_mass_army_1:0 "Send in the Waves"

NLR_mass_army_2:0 "A Gun for Every Soldier"
NLR_mass_army_2_desc:0 "Just because they're expected to rush the enemy until they manage to kill them doesn't mean we won't give our soldiers proper rifles. Ammunition for those rifles on the other hoof, is a completely different story."
NLR_mass_army_3:0 "Support Equipment"
NLR_mass_army_3_desc:0 "Even if a trained mass of ponies can overrun any enemy, even some slight support from artillery, and the ability to dig a trench to hold the line, will boost morale."

NLR_magic_weapons:0 "The Luna Nova Rifle"
NLR_magic_weapons_desc:0 "A combination of magic and ballistic firearms, used by mages, is an interesting proposition worth trialing. If it works, we may have gained an upperhand on the Loyalists."
NLR_magical_studies:0 "Magical Studies"
NLR_magical_studies_desc:0 "There are so many wonderful things you can do with magic, and there are probably some things we don't know we can do with magic yet. Thus we should put some resources together and see what we can find out about the wonderous world of magic and sorcery."
NLR_magical_training:0 "Magical Training"
NLR_magical_training_desc:0 "We have plenty of Unicorns in our army. However not all of them are equal when it comes to power, but we can compensate for this by teaching them all basic combat magic."
NLR_unicorn_academy:0 "Luna's School for Gifted Unicorns"
NLR_unicorn_academy_desc:0 "Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns has been the most prodigious academy for unicorns all across Equestria. With Celestia gone, it's only right that we establish it as Luna's School for Gifted Unicorns. No, we didn't just paint over the sign."
NLR_luna_nova_academy:0 "Reopen the Luna Nova Academy"
NLR_luna_nova_academy_desc:0 "During the Civil War the Luna Nova Academy was grossly neglected, mostly because it found itself in Loyalist hooves. However, with the war over we can now reopen it and restore it to its former glory!"
NLR_better_education:0 "Education Reforms"
NLR_better_education_desc:0 "While Equestria sits under a new ruler, the new ruler is not malevolent. Making schooling for all foals, colts and fillies alike, is the ultimate show of benevolence."

lunas.13.t:0 "The End of Civil War."
lunas.13.d:0 "[GetMonth], [GetYear]. The war is over and we are victorious. The time has come to rebuild and mend our wounds before our enemies eat us alive."
lunas.13.a:0 "Truly!"
lunas.16.t:0 "Jungle Nation."
lunas.16.d:0 "The public of infamous Jungle Nation wants the state to be fully integrated into what they call Equestria. As we are representing what's left of it, it is time for us to take them into our embrace."
lunas.16.a:0 "Yes."
lunas.16.b:0 "Let them stay."
lunas.17.t:0 "Opening up a Second Front"
lunas.17.d:0 "For the last couple of months General Speck and General Midnight Blossom have been hard at work trying to pitch their plans to open up a second front againist the Loyalists. General Speck has proposed that we use the Los Pegasus crime familes and their support to our advantage and launch an attack on Los Pegasus, while General Blossom has proposed we sneak our troops trough the Crystal Mountains and into Whinny to attack the Loyalists from behind, and hopefulyl cut off their contact with the Crystal Empire."
lunas.17.a:0 "An attack on Los Pegasus will break the Loyalists"
lunas.17.b:0 "Taking Whinny will break Equestria's spine"
lunas.17.c:0 "Scrap both of the plans, those ponies will be put to better use elsewhere"
lunas.19.t:0 "The Loyalist Trials"
lunas.19.d:0 "Celestia has been banished, but we've managed to capture most of the Loyalist generals and leaders, we could just execute them and be done with it, but unfortunately that might break the tenuous control we have over the country. So we have no other choice than to put them on trial."
lunas.19.a:0 "This would be so much easier if we could just shoot them."
lunas.20.t:0 "The Trial of Commander Fastclip"
lunas.20.d:0 "Commander Fastclip, once a drill sergeant in the Wonderbolts, had been steadily rising trough Equestria's ranks for years and has only recently become one of their generals. Unfortunately for him he became a commander right before our glorious rebellion. Out of all the generals on trial he's the least controvesial, so it would be easy to just shoot him and be done with it, however he has always been a bit of a shifty sort and could perhaps be convinced to join our officer corps."
lunas.20.a:0 "Shoot him"
lunas.20.b:0 "Make him an offer"
lunas.21.t:0 "The Trial of Commander Whiplash"
lunas.21.d:0 "Commander Whiplash is a retired Wonderbolt who has been serving as one of Equestria's most distinguished generals for a rather long time. While he isn't particularly famous, he isn't unknown either, thankfully our finest lawyers have already managed to pin several wartime crimes against him, and of course the standard charge of treason. However his "crimes" are not nearly enough to warrant an execution, thus we must choose whether to exile him or imprision him."
lunas.21.a:0 "Imprision him"
lunas.21.b:0 "Exile him"
lunas.22.t:0 "The Trial of Commander Soarin"
lunas.22.d:0 "Commander Soarin is to say the least one of the most popular commanders in the Loyalists' army, mostly because of his popularity as a Wonderbolt. However he has declined any and all offers we've made him in an effort to convince him to join us. Thus leaving us in a position in which no matter what we do it will upset someone."
lunas.22.a:0 "Popular or not, hang him up high"
lunas.22.b:0 "Exile him to Yakyakistan"
lunas.22.c:0 "Imprision him and throw away the key"
lunas.23.t:0 "The Trial of Prince Blueblood"
lunas.23.d:0 "The Blueblood that lived before the Civil War might as well be a completely different pony from the stallion standing in front of her majesty's throne today. The responsibility and the stress of the situation has made him into a sight to behold. No longer a whimpering coward, the Blueblood standing before us today is a hardened commander and war hero, but most importantly her majesty's nephew... Despite repeated attempts to convince him to join the Lunar Empire he has remained steadfast, thus leaving us with little choice... We must either execute him or exile him."
lunas.23.a:0 "Exile him..."
lunas.23.b:0 "Shoot him, family or not he is still a traitor"
lunas.24.t:0 "The Trials are Over"
lunas.24.d:0 "With Blueblood's trial over, the so called "Celestial Trials" are finally finished, now we can focus on reinforcing our rule."
lunas.24.a:0 "Back to business"
lunas.25.t:0 "Lunar Terror"
lunas.25.d:0 "Your majesty, it has come to our attention that many different parts of our military are showing deep resentment and hatred for the enemy. While this isn’t a bad thing, per se, it carries with it the side effect of increasingly frequent hate crimes against not only prisoners of war but also civilians that now fall under our occupation. The longer the war drags on, the more bitter the troops become, and with their bitterness the crime rate increases."
lunas.25.a:0 "War is war"
lunas.28.t:0 "The Situation Down South"
lunas.28.d:0 "It seems that against all odds our few remaining loyal soldiers in the South-East have managed to secure it for our glorious empire! While these are joyous news, perhaps we should consider rewarding Commander Stars Whirl with more autonomy for her actions?"
lunas.28.a:0 "Appoint Commander Stars Whirl as the Governor-General of the South-East"
lunas.28.b:0 "They've fullfiled their purpose, integrate them into the Empire."
lunas.29.t:0 "The Capital."
lunas.29.d:0 "As we control most of the Equestria, we need to set our capital in one of the major cities. Or should we keep it down south where it's safest?"
lunas.29.a:0 "Canterlot, the Equestrian Heart."
lunas.29.b:0 "Manehattan, the largest city!"
lunas.29.c:0 "Fillydelphia, the known port!"
lunas.29.e:0 "Baltimare, a chill place."
lunas.29.f:0 "Stableside, it's safe."
lunas.31.t:0 "New name of Stalliongrad"
lunas.31.d:0 "We need to erase all mentions of Stalliongrad as a city for this catastrophe not to repeat in the future."
lunas.31.a:0 "Rename it to Lunargrad."
lunas.31.c:0 "Rename it to Colitsyn."
lunas.31.f:0 "Demolish the city entirely."
lunas.31.b:0 "We don't need to."
lunas.34.t:0 "Bat Appreciation Day"
lunas.34.d:0 "Today marks the inception of the newly christened “Batpony Appreciation Day”, a new national holiday as proclaimed by our Empress Nightmare Moon. In honor of the valiant efforts made by bat ponies serving in our armed forces, today has been set aside as a day of peace, to honor those who fell for our safety. For today, we all stand proud by our leathery-winged brothers and sisters, honored that such ponies are fighting on our behalf, to keep us safe from harm and trouble."
lunas.34.a:0 "Let’s go hug a bat!"
lunas.35.t:0 "Movies, Movies, Movies!"
lunas.35.d:0 "As part of the country’s reconstruction efforts, today the Lunar Government was proud to announce the re-opening of the Film Studios in Las Pegasus, on the west coast of the Empire. Regarded as a center of the modern arts before the war, the Lunar Government is doing its best to help the Theatrical arts reclaim their title. Today across the Empire, one of the major studios, Warner Colts Pictures, put out a large scale advertisement campaign, looking to hire new actors, writers, and film staff, in preparation for a grand re-opening next year. Already, one of the Studio’s directors, one Moon Flower, has announced a film she plans on creating, based on exploits of a heroic squad of bat ponies and loyalist turncoats during the civil war, who began at each other’s throats, but by war’s end were one of the finest teams of soldiers serving the Empire. “I plan on staying as faithful as possible to the original source material,” Flower went on record to say, “so I have been in constant and frequent contact with the surviving members of the squad. All in all, I cannot wait to see this dream become reality, and for a new era of film to be a part of our corner of the world moving forward."
lunas.35.a:0 "Another reason to go to the movies again!"

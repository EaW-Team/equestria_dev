NLR_faster_training_desc:0 "Most of our troops are either conscripts, turncoats or former cultists that just so happen to be on the same side.

NLR_iron_hoof:0 "A Firm Hoof"
NLR_iron_hoof_desc:0 "Our rule is fragile, at this moment, as the Loyalists that we are slowly beginning to rule over protest and attack our troops openly. If we were to let it be known that this kind of behaviour is not tolerated, the legitimacy of our rule would only get stronger."

NLR_crush_resistance:0 "Destroy the Resistance"

NLR_engineer_corp:0 "Establish the Lunar Military Engineer Corps"
NLR_engineer_corp_desc:0 "As the lines between civilians and soldiers blur ever more in the Civil War, more and more industrial complexes are being damaged with no distinction between civilian and military targets being made.

NLR_oil_desc:0 "With each passing day our oil issues become more and more apparent. Unfortunately, even trading for the oil is becoming a less viable option by the day.

NLR_marines_f:0 "Create the Lunar Marines"
NLR_marines_f_desc:0 "While ruling the waves on its own is a great advantage over any enemy, being able to invade from the sea that we own is the greatest advantage. A contingent of soldiers whose mission it is to storm beaches and capture coastlines will bring victory."
NLR_magic_weapons:0 "The Luna Nova Rifle"
NLR_magic_weapons_desc:0 "A combination of magic and ballistic firearms, used by mages, is an interesting proposition worth exploring. If it works, we may have gained an upper hoof on the Loyalists."
NLR_magical_studies:0 "Magical Studies"
NLR_magical_studies_desc:0 "There are so many wonderful things you can do with magic, and there are probably some things we don't know we can do with magic yet. Thus we should put some resources together and see what we can find out about the wondrous world of magic and sorcery."
NLR_magical_training:0 "Magical Training"
NLR_magical_training_desc:0 "We have plenty of Unicorns in our army. However not all of them are equal when it comes to power, but we can compensate for this by teaching them all basic combat magic."

NLR_pardon_the_loyalists_desc:0 "Though our own Generals hate to admit it, the solarist Generals do indeed possess a great amount of skill. Pardoning them and allowing them to re-enter service under the Empress could be very beneficial for our military, indeed."
NLR_allow_worship:0 "Freedom of Worship"
NLR_allow_worship_desc:0 "Our Empire is not narrow-minded and backwards, but instead progressive and forgiving. Although the sun once wrongfully stole the moon's limelight, we must allow our subjects to praise both day and night. Harmony must be maintained, as must peace."

NLR_friends_not_monsters_desc:0 "For over a millennium, ponies all around Equestria lived segregated from the batponies, who were force into living in the shadows.

NLR_grand_army_1_desc:0 "Field Marshal Speck follows the traditional military doctrine of Equestria, being that a vast, drawn-out battle-plan will first be established before any offensive is launched.

lunas.7.b:0 "Let's have a talk."
lunas.8.t:0 "Jungle Nation Refuses"

lunas.11.d:0 "We can decide where our capital should be located now. It is a choice between Canterlot, the original capital of Equestria, where our masters are already installing Luna symbols and erecting monuments in the name of civil war heroes, Manehattan, where the revolt was organised and planned through the whole war, or what was once the Castle of the Two Sisters, the old home of the monarchy."

lunas.17.a:0 "An attack on Los Pegasus will break the Loyalists."
lunas.17.b:0 "Taking Whinny will break Equestria's spine."
lunas.17.c:0 "Scrap both of the plans, those ponies will be put to better use elsewhere."
lunas.19.t:0 "The Loyalist Trials"
lunas.19.d:0 "Celestia has been banished, but we've managed to capture most of the Loyalist generals and leaders, we could just execute them and be done with it, but unfortunately that might break the tenuous control we have over the country. So we have no other choice than to put them on trial."
lunas.19.a:0 "This would be so much easier if we could just shoot them."
lunas.20.t:0 "The Trial of Commander Fastclip"
lunas.20.d:0 "Commander Fastclip, once a drill sergeant in the Wonderbolts, had been steadily rising trough Equestria's ranks for years and has only recently become one of their generals. Unfortunately for him he became a commander right before our glorious rebellion. Out of all the generals on trial he's the least controvesial, so it would be easy to just shoot him and be done with it, however he has always been a bit of a shifty sort and could perhaps be convinced to join our officer corps."
lunas.20.a:0 "Shoot him."
lunas.20.b:0 "Make him an offer."
lunas.21.t:0 "The Trial of Commander Whiplash"
lunas.21.d:0 "Commander Whiplash is a retired Wonderbolt who has been serving as one of Equestria's most distinguished generals for a rather long time. While he isn't particularly famous, he isn't unknown either, thankfully our finest lawyers have already managed to pin several wartime crimes against him, and of course the standard charge of treason. However his "crimes" are not nearly enough to warrant an execution, thus we must choose whether to exile him or imprision him."
lunas.21.a:0 "Imprision him."
lunas.21.b:0 "Exile him."
lunas.22.t:0 "The Trial of Commander Soarin"
lunas.22.d:0 "Commander Soarin is to say the least one of the most popular commanders in the Loyalists' army, mostly because of his popularity as a Wonderbolt. However he has declined any and all offers we've made him in an effort to convince him to join us. Thus leaving us in a position in which no matter what we do it will upset someone."
lunas.22.a:0 "Popular or not, hang him up high."
lunas.22.b:0 "Exile him to Yakyakistan."
lunas.22.c:0 "Imprision him and throw away the key."
lunas.23.t:0 "The Trial of Prince Blueblood"
lunas.23.d:0 "The Blueblood that lived before the Civil War might as well be a completely different pony from the stallion standing in front of her majesty's throne today. The responsibility and the stress of the situation has made him into a sight to behold. No longer a whimpering coward, the Blueblood standing before us today is a hardened commander and war hero, but most importantly her majesty's nephew... Despite repeated attempts to convince him to join the Lunar Empire he has remained steadfast, thus leaving us with little choice... We must either execute him or exile him."
lunas.23.a:0 "Exile him..."
lunas.23.b:0 "Shoot him, family or not he is still a traitor."
lunas.24.t:0 "The Trials are Over"
lunas.24.d:0 "With Blueblood's trial over, the so called "Celestial Trials" are finally finished, now we can focus on reinforcing our rule."
lunas.24.a:0 "Back to business."
lunas.25.t:0 "Lunar Terror"
lunas.25.d:0 "Your majesty, it has come to our attention that many different parts of our military are showing deep resentment and hatred for the enemy. While this isn’t a bad thing, per se, it carries with it the side effect of increasingly frequent hate crimes against not only prisoners of war but also civilians that now fall under our occupation. The longer the war drags on, the more bitter the troops become, and with their bitterness the crime rate increases."
lunas.25.a:0 "War is war."
lunas.26.t:0 "Crystal Night Alliance"
lunas.26.d:0 "King Sombra of the Crystal Empire has sent an official communique to Empress Nightmare Moon and the Lunar Imperial General Staff inviting the Lunar Empire into his Gray Pact alliance. The statement not only includes the promise of military aid in fighting the, quote, 'meddling forces of the Light,' unquote, but also promises for a further expansion later on should the relationship prove profitable. While some voice displeasure at the possibility of aligning ourselves with such an upstart there are others who see promise in the repeatedly resurrected monarch. Regardless of what they think though, they will all toe the line when the Empress indicates which side of the debate she's on."
lunas.26.a:0 "We shall join the Gray Pact."
lunas.26.b:0 "We shall dispose of this so-called king in due time."
lunas.27.t:0 "King Sombra Proposes to Nightmare Moon"
lunas.27.d:0 "At our headquarters today arrived a letter addressed to the Queen of the Night herself from King Sombra of the Crystal Empire. It was a love letter, and a proposal. Sombra laid out his feelings for all to see, and spoke very highly of Nightmare Moon and her nation. It seems that he wants to marry her, and in so doing create an alliance to shake the world. However, some aids remind Her Majesty of the rumors that Sombra once courted Celestia, and they ask if she really wants to risk ending up with her sister's leftovers." 
lunas.27.a:0 "Rumor and fantasy! Sombra will make a fine husband."
lunas.27.b:0 "He's doesn't even have that many divisions, so no."
lunas.28.t:0 "The Situation Down South"
lunas.28.d:0 "It seems that against all odds our few remaining loyal soldiers in the South-East have managed to secure it for our glorious empire! While these are joyous news, perhaps we should consider rewarding Commander Stars Whirl with more autonomy for her actions?"
lunas.28.a:0 "Appoint Commander Stars Whirl as the Governor-General of the South-East."
lunas.28.b:0 "They've fullfiled their purpose, integrate them into the Empire."
lunas.29.t:0 "The Capital"
lunas.29.d:0 "As we control most of the Equestria, we need to set our capital in one of the major cities. Or should we keep it down south where it's safest?"
lunas.29.a:0 "Canterlot, the Equestrian Heart."
lunas.29.b:0 "Manehattan, the largest city!"
lunas.29.c:0 "Fillydelphia, the known port!"
lunas.29.e:0 "Baltimare, a chill place."
lunas.29.f:0 "Stableside, it's safe."
lunas.31.t:0 "New name of Stalliongrad"
lunas.31.d:0 "We need to erase all mentions of Stalliongrad as a city for this catastrophe not to repeat in the future."
lunas.31.a:0 "Rename it to Lunargrad."
lunas.31.c:0 "Rename it to Colitsyn."
lunas.31.f:0 "Demolish the city entirely."
lunas.31.b:0 "We don't need to."
lunas.34.t:0 "Bat Appreciation Day"
lunas.34.d:0 "Today marks the inception of the newly christened “Batpony Appreciation Day”, a new national holiday as proclaimed by our Empress Nightmare Moon. In honor of the valiant efforts made by bat ponies serving in our armed forces, today has been set aside as a day of peace, to honor those who fell for our safety. For today, we all stand proud by our leathery-winged brothers and sisters, honored that such ponies are fighting on our behalf, to keep us safe from harm and trouble."
lunas.34.a:0 "Let’s go hug a bat!"
lunas.35.t:0 "Movies, Movies, Movies!"
lunas.35.d:0 "As part of the country’s reconstruction efforts, today the Lunar Government was proud to announce the re-opening of the Film Studios in Las Pegasus, on the west coast of the Empire. Regarded as a center of the modern arts before the war, the Lunar Government is doing its best to help the Theatrical arts reclaim their title. Today across the Empire, one of the major studios, Warner Colts Pictures, put out a large scale advertisement campaign, looking to hire new actors, writers, and film staff, in preparation for a grand re-opening next year. Already, one of the Studio’s directors, one Moon Flower, has announced a film she plans on creating, based on exploits of a heroic squad of bat ponies and loyalist turncoats during the civil war, who began at each other’s throats, but by war’s end were one of the finest teams of soldiers serving the Empire. “I plan on staying as faithful as possible to the original source material,” Flower went on record to say, “so I have been in constant and frequent contact with the surviving members of the squad. All in all, I cannot wait to see this dream become reality, and for a new era of film to be a part of our corner of the world moving forward."
lunas.35.a:0 "Another reason to go to the movies again!"

lunas.40.d:0 "The Civil war is over and the cursed solarists have been defeated! Now, my children, let us commence with rebuilding our nation, and let us secure our Empire from the vile influence of the traitors! All shall bow before the Night!"
lunas.40.a:0 "They shall learn to love and fear me!"
lunas.41.t:0 "Daytime Curfews"
lunas.41.d:0 "With the Solarists defeated and Celestia out of our way, there is no need to praise the once revered day anymore. Instead, our subjects shall be restricted from going out at daytime, in order to make them see the glory of the night, for the night is strong. For the first time in history, and rightfully so, the day shall be ignored, and the night praised instead."
lunas.41.a:0 "You best not be caught outside past noon"
lunas.42.t:0 "One Sister, One God, One Nation!"
lunas.42.d:0 "The Lunar Empire needs not two but only one ruler. Empress Nightmare Moon, wise and strong as she is, shall unite our Empire behind her banner, and strike at any who oppose us!"
lunas.42.a:0 "Take that, Sister!"
lunas.43.t:0 "Death to the Traitors"
lunas.43.d:0 "The day has come.\n\nToday, in the court of Canterlot Castle, the old capital of the vile Princess of the Sun, the last batch of loyalist traitors was presented to the crowd which had gathered there for the 'event'. The IIS had worked hard to ensure that they found every single last traitor in the Empire, and they had concluded that those were the very last bunch of them.\n\nThe Crowd cheered as the Empress herself made an appearance, speaking to them. Then, the Empress turned and watched as her Lunar Guard approached the blindfolded prisoners. The crowd held its breath.\n\n"Ready! Aim! FIRE!"\n\nThe gunshots echoed through the city, and the crowd cheered as the bodies collapsed to the floor."
lunas.43.a:0 "Serves them right!"
lunas.44.t:0 "Imperial Propaganda"
lunas.44.d:0 "The Imperial ministry of Propaganda has been founded as a means to distribute motivational information to our citizens in order to encourage them to work harder and longer, while also motivating them to join forces in the military. This way, our citizens may never forget about the cause - fighting for the night!"
lunas.44.a:0 "Glory to the Empress!"
lunas.45.t:0 "Reconciliation"
lunas.45.d:0 "The Civil War has come to an end, and it has left behind a Equestria more divided and devastasted than ever before. Cities destroyed, families torn apart and the nation itself divided more than ever.\n\nIn order to combat these problems, and to heal the nation and her subjects, Empress Nightmare Moon wishes to rely on compassion and forgiveness to sway old enemies back to her side, and rebuild Equestria to what it once was."
lunas.45.a:0 "Forgive and Forget"
lunas.46.t:0 "Political Prisoners Released"
lunas.46.d:0 "During the civil war, many loyalists were captured and imprisoned for their political beliefs. They were treated dreadfully, barely able to sustain themselves in their dark cells. Now, the Empress has called for them to be released immediately, saying that we mustn't infringe upon the basic principles of liberty and freedom."
lunas.46.a:0 "Look at them go!"
lunas.47.t:0 "The Elements Forgiven"
lunas.47.d:0 "After the defeat of Celestia, we managed to catch and arrest the 6 bearers of the elements of harmony. Many expected Nightmare Moon to act harshly against them, knowing that it was the elements of harmony that had banished her to the moon for a thousand years, They were proven wrong, however, as Nightmare Moon released all six of them from prison in good spirit. The Empress says that their freedom and safety is in the best interest of both them and Equestria as a whole, seeing as how the elements are powerful and were able to protect Equestria from evil many times in the past.\n\nThe six ponies, though still on guard, were given train tickets back to their hometown and left the capital via train a few hours ago."
lunas.47.a:0 "Now off to Ponyville you go!"
lunas.48.t:0 "Loyalist Generals Pardoned"
lunas.48.d:0 "Following the collapse of solarist resistance, plenty of the loyalist generals were captured by our forces. Today, the Empress has made the surprising decision to pardon them in court, rather than punishing them for their crimes against the Empire. She even went as far as to offer them a position in the Lunar Forces, saying that their skill was greatly welcomed, now that they were on the winning side."
lunas.48.a:0 "They put up a good fight, for sure"
lunas.49.t:0 "The Solarian Worship Act"
lunas.49.d:0 "Despite the fierce rivalry Nightmare Moon has with Celestia, she has admitted that harmony must be maintained in order for Equestria and the world as a whole to function properly. As such, Lunar citizens are now permitted to once again praise the sun and day. This has caused much distress and unrest among the lunar supporters, who fear a counter-rebellion from these new solar followers. The Empress, however, is sure that friendliness is the only way to ensure these ponies stay with her."
lunas.49.a:0 "They better not cause any trouble"
lunas.50.t:0 "Hug a Bat Day"
lunas.50.d:0 "Today marks the beginning of a new tradition for everypony in the Empire. A new holiday, the 'Hug a Bat Day' has been brought to life by the Empress as a means of bringing the Batponies and other pony races together into once society, and mending the deep, millenia-old wounds that exist between the two sides. Henceforth, batponies shall live alongside other ponies, without discrimination or fear!\n\nJournalists report that, while some bats are still on edge about the hugging, most batponies were more than eager to rapproach their old pony enemies by spending the holiday together. The hugging part of the holiday will likely take shape next year or the year after, when the two sides have come to know each other well enough."
lunas.50.a:0 "Let’s go hug a bat!"
lunas.51.t:0 "The New Nightmare Night"
lunas.51.d:0 "While Nightmare Night was once introduced to remember the defeat of Nightmare Moon and banishment of her to the moon, the Empress has now ordered this tradition to be changed to something more appropriate. Henceforth, the holiday will be dedicated to happy celebrations and spending time with other community members, especially the batponies who are slowly migrating to bigger towns and cities. There are fun parties all around, with plenty of shenanigans happening allnight!"
lunas.51.a:0 "I still can't find my pants!"
lunas.52.t:0 "Bat Appreciation Day"
lunas.52.d:0 "The newest holiday in the Empire, the Bat Appreciation Day, has been received very well indeed by the Empire's citizens. Even this year, more ponies than the year before gathered to celebrate the thestrals, with parties and various other activities carrying on deep into the night. It was a great day for everypony involved, and it once again shows how well the batponies and other pony races have merged into one solidified society under the Empress."

lunas.53.d:0 "What was once Nightmare Night, and an evening filled with dark, twisted stories and fear of the dark and evil has, under the decree of the Empress herself, become something much more light-hearted and joyful. Like last year, ponies all across the Empire, including the batponies, gathered around in public to enjoy some precious, fun times with one another. What was intended to merge batpony and pony society with one another seems to be fullfilling its purpose perfectly, and everypony involved says they can't wait for next year's celebrations, even if they still have a headache after all the apple cider they drank that night."

lunas.54.d:0 "Though it was initially an awkward experience for both sides, the new Hug a Thestral holiday seems to now be a new day of interest for both batponies and other ponies. Though they were originally, for millenia, segregated and in a silent rivalry with one another, the rift between the Thestrals and other ponies seems to be shrinking more and more with each year, and the Hug a Thestral day surely plays a big part in it. All over the Empire, old rivalries are being left behind in favour of friendship and forgiveness. While some ponies still hold onto their old grudges, more ponies and bats than ever before engaged in friendly activities and, naturally, also the traditional hugging. We have high hopes that next year, the celebrations and friendly spirit of this holiday will grow even further!"

 ### Ideas ###
 
 TBK_loveable_drunk:0 "The Loveable Drunk"
 TBK_loveable_drunk_desc:0 "Sometimes you need a loveable face. The kind you’d punch if the pony behind it wasn’t just that damn charming. Even in the worst of places, that kind of pony always helps smooth things over. He’s nice! He gives everypony a good time and you kind of forget what you were mad about. In Tobuck, that’s Giggle Juice, the president of the republic and the funniest drinking buddy Pea Shooter ever met. The only issue here is that the loveable face enjoys a good drink. Or three. At breakfast."
 TBK_fake_republic:0 "The Fake Republic"
 TBK_fake_republic_desc:0 "Tobuck! A free, modern and sovereign republic! The only issue is that no Tobuckian actually wanted one. Or rather, the few who did want one certainly didn’t want some gun runner to run it. In a land that happily thrived under a monarchy, the announcement of the republic landed like a cannonball shot with not enough gunpowder: making a big “thud” in the mud.\n\nIn the end, nopony was really fooled by the proclamation of the republic, even the Hippogriffian and Maregyptian ambassadors who were still happy to give lip service to the idea that Chiropterra, Warzena and Zarantia ought to think twice about moving in. But bits help smooth things over and a fake republic has a way of streamlining government decision."
 TBK_warlord_reliance:0 "Warlord Reliance"
 TBK_warlord_reliance_desc:0 "When Tobuck proclaimed its independence, it had no army, just mercenaries, a lot of guns and some bits. With their charm, Pea Shooter and Vasile Cel Tradat managed to convinced a few promising adventurer and costly friends to set up their own forces. Each was given a provincial governorate to male their job of defending the country easier. And while it did provide an effective defending forces, there might be some issues in relying on warlords."
 TBK_zarantian_loyalism:0 "Zarantian Loyalism"
 TBK_zarantian_loyalism_desc:0 "A former Warzenan province, Tobuck soured on its historical master for many a reason. And so, when queens of the desert came and liberated them, they embraced her as their savior. It proved a successful choice as the Zarantian wished for a richer region to use as their center of power. The Storm King brought an end to the promising future of the Kingdom of Zarantia and Tobuck had its fate decided for them by a clique of innovative businesscreatures as they call themselves. In the end, it’s not hard to understand why the merchants and citizens of Tobuck have a nostalgia for the Zebra Queen of the east. And should Mekiouzza come for them, they might help."

 ### National Foci ###
 
 TBK_art_of_the_deal: "The Art of the Deal"
 TBK_art_of_the_deal_desc: "Some ponies would consider the finest art to be the graceful brushstrokes that inhabit a painter's canvas, or maybe the soothing harmonies that fill the walls of a concert hall with on performance night; but for arms dealers Pea Shooter and Vasile Cel Tradat, there is no greater art in the world than the art of the deal."
 
 TBK_board_meeting: "A Board Meeting"
 TBK_board_meeting_desc: "The future of a business is always uncertain, doubly so when in the risky trade of firearms, and triply so when it's sponsored by a state coming apart at the seams; it would be prudent to meet with the board of associates and take stock of the current situation."
 
 TBK_trip_to_manehattan: "A Trip to Manehattan" 
 TBK_trip_to_manehattan_desc: "Even with the prospect of Tobuck and its highly profitable arms trade collapsing, Pea Shooter is unwaveringly stoic about the whole situation. Few are aware of the fact that he has an out; family back in Manehattan that he can turn to when this whole business finally dries up."
 
 TBK_last_letter: "The Last Letter"
 TBK_last_letter_desc: "Pea Shooter receives the final letter from his family in Manehattan, finalizing his plans to escape, if at all possible."
 
 TBK_end_game: "The End Game"
 TBK_end_game_desc: "A meeting is called between Pea Shooter and Vasile, with the stated purpose of taking stock and deciding what to do with Tobuck in its current state."
 
 TBK_facade_of_democracy: "The Facade of Democracy"
 TBK_facade_of_democracy_desc: "It's an open secret in Tobuck that the government and its stated "Democracy" are just an elaborate sham to garner support from Harmonist nations like Maregypt, when in reality much of the country is governed by authoritarian warlords, and democratically elected officials have little power."
 
 TBK_meet_giggle_juice: "Meet Giggle Juice"
 TBK_meet_giggle_juice_desc: "While effectively a puppet, one of the most important ponies in Tobuck's democracy is a pony named Giggle Juice. A drunkard who lacks actual power, but makes up for it with an abundance of charisma; he's a popular figurehead in the eyes of many, and his support is paramount to maintaining the facade of Democracy." 
 
 TBK_grease_the_wheel: "Greasing the Wheel of Democracy"
 TBK_grease_the_wheel_desc: "Even though the elected government holds little power, simply subverting them by use of force would be inexcusable in both the eyes of the people and friendly regimes; as such it sometimes requires a little bit of bribery and blackmail to convince government bureaucrats to sign off on risky legislature, and smile while doing it."
 
 TBK_meeting_warlords: "Meeting the Warlords"
 TBK_meeting_warlords_desc: "The three major Warlords in Tobuck are largely autonomous in how their handle their own affairs; but it's important to keep them in line and remind them that it's far more profitable for us to work together than it is against each other."
 
 TBK_meet_ambassadors: "Meeting the Ambassadors"
 TBK_meet_ambassadors_desc: "Statecraft is a two sided coin if ever there was one. On the one hoof it opens up the door to highly beneficial allies and treaties, on the other it can have you dragged into unnecessary conflict with your neighbors. It pays well when we set aside time for meeting with representatives from other nations, even if it's time that could be spent peddling rifles."
 
 TBK_visit_militarized_zone: "Visit the Militarized Zone"
 TBK_visit_militarized_zone_desc: "Past our western border lies the nation of New Tzinacatlia, a remnant nation lead by what remains of the dreaded Nightmare Legion. Due to both our proximity and apparent instability, Tobuck makes for a fine target in the eyes of Lord Commander Autumn Breeze; with this in mind it is imperative that we maintain a constant presence on the border that is both fortified and capable in nature."
 
 TBK_pay_day_the_heist: "Their Pay Day"
 TBK_pay_day_the_heist_desc: "After thoroughly touching base with everypony that props up our make-believe democracy, it's time for them to reap the benefits of their loyalty. After all, we want it to be pretty clear that allegiance is an investment that pays dividends."
 
 TBK_everyponys_a_critic: "Everypony's a critic"
 TBK_everyponys_a_critic_desc: "Even with ample political maneuvering and widespread support for proposed legislation, there's always critics talking about how we're "Undermining Democracy" and "Using the state as a means to enrich ourselves". Pesky journalists usually change their tune when bribed, and if that doesn't work just call in the enforcers."
 
 TBK_business_of_gun_running: "The Business of Gun Running"
 TBK_business_of_gun_running_desc: "Arms trafficking is the bread and butter of Tobuck. It's why the government was founded, how it's funded, why it's leaders even care, and ultimately the glue that binds Tobuckian society together. On top of all that, it makes us extremely rich!" 
 
 TBK_checking_the_supply: "Checking the Supply"
 TBK_checking_the_supply_desc: "One of the most important things an arms dealer maintains is his reputation. Sell defective arms to a customer one too many times and you may as well consider yourself out of a job. Word travels at the speed of a bullet, and we should always make sure we're selling the best we have to offer."
 
 TBK_first_rule_of_gun_running: "The First Rule of Gun Running"
 TBK_first_rule_of_gun_running_desc: "The first and most important rule of gun-running is, never get shot with your own merchandise. Sell it unloaded, and sell it to people way out of killing range."
 
 TBK_second_rule_of_gun_running: "The Second Rule of Gun Running" 
 TBK_second_rule_of_gun_running_desc: "The second rule of gun-running is always ensure you have a foolproof way of getting paid, preferably in advance, preferably to an offshore account. If you don't have a guaranteed way to get your cash in the end, the deal isn't worth it."
 
 TBK_to_each_their_game: "To Each Their Game"
 TBK_to_each_their_game_desc: "A free market is good for business, but there is a such thing as it being too free. With a little bookkeeping and regulation we can ensure that only loyal liaisons and captains are shipping our guns around, and that none of them are sold to local warlords that could try to muscle in on the trade."
 
 TBK_meeting_the_banker: "Meeting With the Banker"
 TBK_meeting_the_banker_desc: "One of the most important part of Tobuck's gun trade is offshore bank accounts; Tobuck is not a state with a stable economy. Storing our accumulated wealth in local banks is just asking for it to be lost with the next financial crisis, which is why it's important to regularly meet with overseas bankers to maintain foreign accounts."
 
 TBK_pay_day_2: "Our Pay Day"
 TBK_pay_day_2_desc: "The rules have been set, the sellers regulated and the offshore accounts maintained. We're fit to rake in cash for as long as our supply lasts, come Tatarus or high water."
 
 TBK_performance_review: "Performance Review"
 TBK_performance_review_desc: "With ample use of auditors and statisticians, we can actually get to the business of determining if all of our hard work has actually paid off in the end, or if we've just wasted our time with bad business."
 
 ### Leader descriptions ###

pea_shooter_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 17th of november 962 in Trottingham\n\n§YBiography§!: When Pea Shooter was just a foal, one could hardly picture the cheerful little one to become a gun runner. With a loving family, the loveliest of childhood crush turned happy wife and good prospect as a shipping merchant between St. Petershoof and Skyfall. But still, even with all of that, little Pea Shooter was bored.\n\nIt could have all ended with a simple middle-aged pony finding a hobby or drinking the occasional excessive cider but then came the Stalliongrad Revolution. His family’s business was ruined but Pea Shooter saw an opportunity. With the help of a shady friend, he bought some guns from a Fezeran smuggler and travelled back home, selling them to a communist volunteer group. And also one Severnayan counter-revolutionary he had met in a bar. He made good bit on those deals and decided to make it his career. He travelled to Haukland, making some deals there before finding his way south, wherever there were bits and a need for gunpowder.\n\nIn 1005, he made his way to Zebrica, looking to make bank on that insane Yeti whilst he was still on a roll. He failed as the Storm King died and his conquest spree ended the following year. But! He was in Tobuck with some friends and it just so happened that one of those friends had friends guarding the supply depots in the region. And with half of Zebrica in turmoil, Pea Shooter exactly knew where to find his clientele.\n\nWith the help of Vasil Cel Tradat, he helped bring about the independence of Tobuck, the birth of harmonic republicanism in the region, found some pony to become its face while he became foreign affairs minister. As long as there was guns to sell in Tobuck, there would be business to do there for any good gun-runner.\n\nAnd Pea Shooter is more than a good one.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Bunnyshrubby"

 yakistan.1.t:0 "Two Yakyakistans"
 yakistan.1.d:0 "Years ago, the Jaki-clan tore our unified nation apart when they secceeded from Yakyakistan. It was the greatest tragedy of our kind since ancient days, and brought with it a long and costly war that devastated all yak lands. The jaks were not overcome, but they could also not defeat three united clans. The two sides stalemated until famine and economic collapse forced a grudging peace.\n\nOur naive belief in yak unity and fraternity is shattered, as is the myth of our strength in battle. Our ruined fields and desolate valleys are full of bitter, unhappy survivors of a war that should never have happened. The rich landowners of Yakitown might not mind a bit, but the disgruntled veteran clan warriors of Bara'dur and the impoverished workers of Karsakag demand changes.\n\nIn these bleak times, yaks return to the old ways, calling upon tribal elders to decide what must be done."
 yakistan.1.a:0 "May our ancestors protect us..."

 yakistan.2.t:0 "Prelude to War"
 yakistan.2.d:0 "The Elders talk long into the night, and the conversation is difficult to follow. They talk of the Seccessionist clan and its complaints. Some Elders, bitter from the pointless loss of life, go as far as to blame Rutherford and his policies for the rift, calling him an upstart and a schismatic. Elders from Bara'dur grumble ominously about the degeneracy of the younger, Harmonic-minded generation. Elders from Karsakag bring with them ideas of yaks who have spoken with the ponies of Stalliongrad. Every Elder talks about what must change.\n\nBut they are all united on one front. There can only be one Yakyakistan, whatever the future holds. Revolution, Democracy, Empire, Isolation, whatever comes, can only come after the Jaki are dealt with. The false prince and the traitors must be taught a lesson, and their yaks must rejoin the fold. They will not listen to words. Yakyakistan must go to war again."
 yakistan.2.a:0 "The Elders have spoken!"
 
 yakistan.3.t:0 "The Election"
 yakistan.3.d:0 "The Elders put off the decision regarding Yakyakistan's future until the war was won, and now that the Jaki have been humbled, they meet again. Prince Rutherford led the armies of Yakyakistan well, but no one has forgotten that it was Rutherford who lost the Jaki in the first place. Some Say that he has redeemed himself, and champion his new ideas. Others say that the war's losses were excessive, and that his weakness can no longer be tolerated. Finally, Elders from Karsakag now speak openly about ideas they once left to whispers. The exhuasted and overworked common yaks cry out for relief, and this new Communism business seems like just the way to help them.\n\nAfter days of debate and several stampedes and brawls, the elders must decide. Rutherford and his Harmonic Monarchy? Karsakag's elders and yak revolution? Or will Bara'dur put an end to all of this weakness and claim Yakyakistan's place in the sun?"
 yakistan.3.a:0 "We Believe in Rutherford and Harmony!"
 yakistan.3.b:0 "Bara'dur is right. Yakyakistan First and Only!"
 yakistan.3.c:0 "The common yak shall no longer suffer. For the People!"
 
 yakistan.4.t:0 "The Fate of Bradford"
 yakistan.4.d:0 "'Prince' Bradford led the Jaki rebels, and now he is in our custody. So far, we have left him alone to think over his failures, but he is a loose end. Most of the Elders want to have him killed or imprisoned for life. Those who supported the harmonic ideas that Rutherford introduced propose that he be forgiven and one day allowed to lead his people once more, this time in defence of all yaks. The response to this was absolutely deafening, but eventually order was restored. What shall we do with this misguided patriot-turned-traitor?"
 yakistan.4.a:0 "Heal the wounds and spare him."
 yakistan.4.b:0 "Show the Jaki the price of betrayal."
 
 yakistan.5.t:0 "The Scars of War"
 yakistan.5.d:0 "The war is over, but our problems continue. The laborers are exhausted, the army is spent, and the coffers are empty. The Jaki have returned, but their place in Yakyakistan is no longer an easy or natural one. As soldiers return home and yaks rebuild their shattered lives, the government must work out how best to reintegrate the rebel lands. The Jaki's hostility is strong, and until we have won them over and they accept our rule, their reluctance will make rebuilding more dificult."
 yakistan.5.a:0 "One way or another, we are One."
 
 yakistan.6.t:0 "Palaver of the Warriors"
 yakistan.6.d:0 "After the first war, the veterans of Bara'dur were bitter and let their hatreds fester. Their elders pushed for empire and merciless razing of Jaki settlements. The Prince arrives in Bara'dur and holds court, inviting the elders of the clan to air their grievances and concerns, while also offering their counsel. His gambit to loosen some of the grip of the newly founded Veteran's League on the elders is successful to an extent. The Prince holds a great feast, inviting the greatest of Bara'dur's warriors and heroes as well as its elites and eventually even the common yaks. The Feast of Bara'dur is spoken of for years afterwards as the time when the clan felt whole again."
 yakistan.6.a:0 "A toast!"
 
 yakistan.7.t:0 "Fanfare For the Common Yak"
 yakistan.7.d:0 "Some of his retinue expressed concern about going in person to Karsakag, being that it is a hotbed of communist sentiment. But the Prince was undeterred. Communists or not, they are all yaks, and they are all his people. He hired yovidaphone players to play a great fanfare before announcing to a cheering crowd of thousands that the royal house was preparing a great feast for the hardworking yaks who had helped deliver Yakyakistan in its hour of direst need. They are the true heroes, he said, and all of the accolades and honor belong to them. Even the trade unionists were impressed by his sincerity."
 yakistan.7.a:0 "Bread and Maybe a Few Roses!"
 
 yakistan.8.t:0 "Trouble in Jakistan"
 yakistan.8.d:0 "While the loyal clans have seen great reconstruction efforts, the desolation of Jakistan is still largely the same. Efforts to bring yaks there into the fold of the nation have been met with resistance, with local officials that we allowed to stay in place stalling most of our projects, and with much of the local labor force refusing to work on projects that would benefit them and the nation as a whole. Shipping in labor from Karsakag has proved troublesome, as the trade unions demand better security and hazard pay on one side and the Jakistani malcontents harassing workers and refusing to sell to them on the other. While there has been talk of an official visit to the region to make gestures at reconciliation, it is at present too dangerous. \n\nThe war may be over, but it is likely that the Jakistani lands will bear scars of it for a very long time. But no matter what, we will press on until all yaks are united again."
 yakistan.8.a:0 "We'll Keep Trying"
 
 yakistan.9.t:0 "Trouble in Jakistan, Redux"
 yakistan.9.d:0 "Elders from Yakitown and Karsakag have visited some of the more traditionalist-minded villages and towns of Jakistan on a mission of peace. This has been somewhat successful, as our reconstruction efforts in areas they have visited are no longer harrassed or frustrated by local resistance. Some of the more nomadic jaks have filled the void that the sedentary merchants have vacated, selling to our workers at reasonable if inflated prices. Though many in Jakistan still see us as the enemy, they have also realized that our efforts can only help them, and we no longer have to scrounge for workers from Karsakag for public works."
 yakistan.9.a:0 "The Jaki shall be our partners."
 
 yakistan.10.t:0 "Trouble in Jakistan, Final"
 yakistan.10.d:0 "In a moving address, the Elders of Yakitown, Bara'dur, and Karsakag spoke to large crowds in the former Jaki capitol. They spoke of shared hardships, and of the shared joys of recovery. They spoke at length about their desire to be one people again, and after they had all spoken, our leader delivered the final speech of the day. He spoke about our shared wounds, and about the horrors of war. In a shocking move, he proclaimed that the rebuilding of the capitol was being funded from his own personal estate, and from the personal estates of several other prominent yaks who had been involved in the leadup to war. It was arrogance that caused this rift, so he said to the crowd as he laid out his future plans for their city, and we will never be so foolish again.\n\nA great feast in the capitol followed, as Yak and Jak celebrated their newly-reborn fraternity once more, and all spoke excitedly of what the future might hold for Yakyakistan. The Jakistani resistance, though still technically existing, is functionally already irrelevant."
 yakistan.10.a:0 "Finally, we have healed."
 
 yakistan.11.t:0 "The Prince's Sneldarfest in Bara'dur"
 yakistan.11.d:0 "Every year, yaks all across Yakyakistan celebrate the most important yak festival--Sneldarfest! The royal household is no different. As part of his attempts to unify the tribes once more, Prince Rutherford has turned the royal festivities into a feast for the elders and leading yaks of all the clans, even inviting the head-yaks of some of the larger nomadic herds to Yakitown.\n\nYaks across the nation are treated to a full page of glorious photos of the event. For the first time, many yaks see just how much wealth their ruler and Yakyakistan itself is capable of, but also that their leaders are talking and working together. The sight of invited veterans, common soldiers all, surprises yaks used to distant, elitist leadership. It is not quite as inspiring as one would hope, but the common yak cannot help but feel festive about Sneldarfest. The holiday is what we all need now, in times that are still hard."
 yakistan.11.a:0 "Happy Sneldarfest!"
 
 yakistan.12.t:0 "The Equestrian Alliance"
 yakistan.12.d:0 "Late at night, in the palatial suites in Yakitown, the Prince of Yakyakistan and his advisors host a party of ponies. They are very strange creatures, these ponies. They are so small and frail, yet have so much power and influence. On some level, it should offend the yak way. Yet he finds instead that these strange little ponies delight him.\n\nThey are here on a mission of great import, here to hear out his minister's offer of alliance. Yakyakistan seeks to join the Equestria-led alliance. The changelings are rising, the griffons are resurgent, and the world is far more dangerous now than it was before--and so he needs friends. He needs allies, and Equestria needs a war-proven army to keep the Changelings and perhaps one day the griffons at bay. Can Rutherford and Celestia find common ground across vast cultural divides? And if she can... should we tie ourselves to the Sun and its troubles?"
 yakistan.12.a:0 "Yakyakistan joins the Alliance!"
 yakistan.12.b:0 "Negotiations break down..."
 
 yakistan.13.t:0 "The Yakyakistani Revolution"
 yakistan.13.d:0 "It was a close thing, but when the supremacist Veteran's League from Bara'dur showed its true colors, the Harmonists and Traditionalists joined us in expelling their Elders. We made short work of the elections from there on out.\n\nComrade Secretary Karsak Sükhbataar emerges as leader of the new Grand Soviet which has supplanted the prince and his stooges. But our people are backwards. As communists, we understand that the peasantry must be educated and given what they have long been denied. Socialization of agriculture is important, but first we must introduce the teachings of Stalliongrad... with Yak characteristics, of course. "
 yakistan.13.a:0 "All Power to the Soviet!"

 yakistan.14.t:0 "Preparing a Great Leap Forward"
 yakistan.14.d:0 ""We have inherited a shattered nation. The greedy capitalist war, the pointless political squabbling, the exploitation of the people... There is much work to be done. From Karsakag, the Yakistani Soviet prepares a great plan. It has three main goals. First, agriculture must be modernized to avoid famine now and forever; secondly, our industry is backwards and exploitative and it must be modernized; lastly, our culture is stagnant from worthless and reactionary traditionalism that must be purged through re-education. To this end, the Soviet announces the Great Leap Forward.\n\n'Comrades! Remember that we must all work hard for a glorious paradise, but rest assured that it is coming. Yakyakistan shall be for the workers at last!" announced Comrade Secretary Sükhbataar in the party's newspaper."
 yakistan.14.a:0 "From Every Yak's ability!"
 
 yakistan.15.t:0 "The Civilian Industrial Plan"
 yakistan.15.d:0 "As part of our efforts to modernize, the Grand Soviet of the Party has voted to roll out a series of updates to our factories. Though some worried over the lack of safety measures, Secretary Sükhbataar cast the deciding vote to push the measure through. Safety was important, but digging Yakyakistan out of the backwards primitive hole it is currently in is paramount. If we cannot modernize quickly, we will be left in the dust. Our survival depends on building socialism in Yakyakistan, and building socialism in such a backwards country is going to be a messy affair."
 yakistan.15.a:0 "To Every Yak's need!"
 
 yakistan.16.t:0 "The Military-Industrial Complex"
 yakistan.16.d:0 "After the enemies with guns have been wiped out, there will still be enemies without guns. But until they are wiped out, we still require guns. The Grand Soviet passes further legislation requiring strict production quotas from the workers of Bara'dur. The protests are muted this time around. Every one of the ministers remembers that it was elders and veterans from Bara'dur that tried to drag us all into a supremacist nightmare. \n\nBut the motive of this decision is not revenge. Bara'dur has the military factories, and we need guns to safeguard the revolution. If anything, the Soviet sees this as a chance at redemption. We shall let the workers of Bara'dur prove their class loyalties through their contributions!"
 yakistan.16.a:0 "Give your all, comrades!"
 
 yakistan.17.t:0 "Triumphs of the Revolution"
 yakistan.17.d:0 "Our plans have come to fruition, and Yakyakistan has made unbelievable strides towards being a truly modern state. The Grand Soviet has declared a day of celebration, where all of the undustrial workers and agricultural peasantry have been given the day off. Though our former allies amongst the Unionists complain that our methods have been needlessly dangerous, they are merely shortsighted. The workers endured and sacrificed for this victory, and we should all be proud of their work. Of course, it would be a bit pre-mature for us to lower the daily quotas, or to change our safety regulations just yet. We must make sure there is a surplus and a secure state first. But in the mean time, we have abolished the old rationing for most sections of the populace in recognition of our success."
 yakistan.17.a:0 "All that work paid off."
 
 yakistan.18.t:0 "Joining the Internationale"
 yakistan.18.d:0 "Equestrian Socialism may not be exactly what we're working towards, but its close enough, and our leaders were first educated politcally by Stalliongradian cadres. The Grand Secretary is a proud yak, but he knows that we need allies. Represenatives of our party have arrived in Stalliongrad to negotiate our attendance of the next congress of the Internationale. This basic level of internationalist involvement is a vital step in the Soviet's ultimate plan to align itself with Stalliongrad politically and militarily.\n\nThe Stalliongradians are a bit hesitant about our methods and question our theory, but we are obviously fellow travelers. But our commitment to worldwide revolution and our zeal for spreading communist ideas to the peasantry impress them. When we ask for formal acceptance into the congress and eventual alliance..."
 yakistan.18.a:0 "They welcome us with open arms!"
 yakistan.18.b:0 "Betrayed by our comrades..."
 
 yakistan.19.t:0 "A Ruined State"
 yakistan.19.d:0 "The new Khan Koletiv and his loyal Veteran's League inherits a nation that has lost touch of everything that made it great. Yakyakistan used to be a force to be reckoned with! We had a Khanate that the continent quaked at the mere mention of, and now we are backwards and the peoples we once terrorized laugh at us. Jakistan is in ruins, and the loyal clans fare little better. The economy is in shambles, the army is exhausted, and we can barely make arms as it is.\n\nThe Khan will change all that. He has plans for all yaks to be strong and proud once again! We will fix the economy through rapid modernization, learning or staling technology as we can. Our army will be strong again, and our borders secure. One day, when we are ready, yaks will again be a terror upon the puny lesser races of this continent. Glory to Yakyakistan! Glory to the Khan!"
 yakistan.19.a:0 "Glory to Khan Koletiv!"
 
 yakistan.20.t:0 "Restoring the Khanate"
 yakistan.20.d:0 "Our first course of action in rebuilding Yakyakistan is to take stock of what we do have. While our army is understrength and requires both replacement soldiers and better weapons, we do already have a sizeable force built up. The build-up to war left us with a stronger industrial base than we had when the traitors first left. The yaks of Bara'dur and Karsakag now work for the state, building infastructure and more factories, guns and ammunition. \n\nFrom this beginning, Koletiv sees his next steps clearly. We must reclaim use of the Jaki lands and strengthen our economy through investment in military production. We will put yaks to work even as we build back our military in a new and far stronger mold."
 yakistan.20.a:0 "A Strong Army for a Strong Nation."
 
 yakistan.21.t:0 "A Hoof To the Face, Forever"
 yakistan.21.d:0 "We could not forgive the old prince for his failures and his weakness. Seriously, toying with harmonism of all things? Disgraceful. But he is a saint compared to the despicable Jaki traitors. How dare they break apart our glorious nation!\n\nThe Khan moves forward with this plans to reclaim the use of Jaki land. Specifically, and against the wishes of many of the now-powerless elders, he has taken from the traitors much of their private holdings and turned it over to auction for those enterprises willing to use it for the glory of Yakyakistan to build new factories. The Jaki will not be forgiven. Those that deserve to live will do so when they have worked for redemption on our assembly lines and in our fields. They threw off being yaks, so let them be less than yaks until such a time as they can come to their senses."
 yakistan.21.a:0 "Traitors deserve no better."
 
 yakistan.22.t:0 "SMASHING Is The Highest Calling"
 yakistan.22.d:0 "With new weapons in hoof, the Khan plans for Yakyakistan's future conquests. Our neighbors are existential threats until we have either annihilated them or humbled them. The bears to the north are worthy opponents in hoof to claw, but their forces are weak compared to our own. Even further north, after we've crushed the bears, the penguins and their frozen empire might also be worth our time to subjugate.\n\nTo the east is the difficult yet rewarding task of teaching the griffons a long overdue lesson for driving us out of our ancestral lands. They will be difficult to defeat, but it will be a war that most yaks are hungry for...\n\nTo the south is Equestria and the Crystal Empire. These are, for now, far beyond us. One day, once we've united much of the continent under our rule, we can dream of storming through the southern lands.\n\nThe last choice is to go west. The Changelings are a mysterious, if disgusting people. We know little besides myth and legend, and that their tanks are legendary. They have industry and resources, that we know, and those things may win us the continent if we can claim them for our own. "
 yakistan.22.a:0 "Where shall we strike first?"
 
 yakistan.23.t:0 "An Otherwise Normal Day"
 yakistan.23.d:0 "It was a normal day. Khan Koletiv reviewed reports from his general staff on the state of the army, and was pleased. Things were going well. Only the night before, he discussed in detail the logistics of invading the changelings to the west. His generals were split on the matter, but all agreed that sound plans would be required.\n\nHe took breakfast as he always did without anyone present, and so was surprised when a young officer entered. But he was loathe to treat any military yak poorly! He hailed the officer. 'What is your business here? I take my meals alone, young yak.'\n\n'I'm sorry to bother you, sir,' said the stranger. 'It's just that I have an urgent dispatch. May I approach?'\n\nUrgent? His brow furrowed. If it was worth disturbing him... 'Yes. Come closer.'\n\nThe young officer approached, and reached into the pack at his side. The Khan began to rise...\n\nAnd then it was just a normal day. The Khan ate alone, as he always did, and no one disturbed him. He went about his normal routine, and no one was any bit the wiser. Except, of course, for a keen young officer helping some orderlies carry a large package away."

Its people were strangers, but whether because of infiltrator indoctrination or a natural communal spirit, we have grown closer. A changeling queen leads the country, and changeling hives in the countryside join joint hive cities where yaks and Changeling colonists live in relative peace.\n\nWe are slowly but surely becoming one people, strange and intermingled, but one. Perhaps one day we shall teach them to change their forms, and they shall give us their strength.\n\nBut the motherland calls us, interrupting our newfound lives. The Queen demands a renewal of our oaths. Changelings across the frontier look around and begin to ask questions that seemed impossible before--do we truly need to live under Chrysalis' yoke? Can we not live as changelings in a new land on our own?\n\nOr do we demonstrate our loyalties to our species and Queen? A New Frontier with a new way of life, or just a colony of the Great Empire?"

We have been granted some autonomy and self-rule in return for unswerving loyalty to her aims, and this is good enough for us.\n\nYakiland, or the Frontier as it is sometimes called, is metamorphosing into a strange hybrid society. Indoctrination has given way to something approaching a hybrid society, and the old machinery of domination has been replaced by yaks who are integrated mind and soul into our hives, often without even knowing it, as we now integrate ourselves.

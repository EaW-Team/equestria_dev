AET_realpolitik_desc:0 "Greifwald sits between two of the largest powers on the continent: The Kingdom of Aquileia and the old Griffonian Empire. It is of the utmost importance that we maintain good relations with both. We cannot let Greifwald fall into the hands of extremists, as it is likely that such a change would put us on the path to war with one or more powers on the Griffonian continent."
AET_complete_neutrality:0 "A Policy of Neutrality"
AET_complete_neutrality_desc:0 "We must maintain complete and utter neutrality in our dealings with both the Aquileians and the Imperials. To this end, we will instruct all echelons of power in Greifwald that the highest priority of the State is the preservation of the status quo. Greifwald shall be a beacon of stability in a world full of extremists."
AET_appease_both:0 "Work With Both"
AET_appease_both_desc:0 "Both the Kingdom of Aquileia and the old Griffonian Empire have much to offer us, if we play our cards right. We should launch a new diplomatic initiative, with the goal of strengthening our ties with both powers. "
AET_welfare_program:0 "Economic Relief Effort"
AET_welfare_program_desc:0 "Our economy is in shambles and there is widespread poverty among the people. Now that we have invited foreign industrialists into Greifwald, we are in a position to actually do something about it."
AET_align_imperial:0 "Work with the Imperials"
AET_align_imperial_desc:0 "The Empire has been the greatest power in Griffonia for centuries. Even though it's power has declined under Grover V, it is very likely that the Griffonian Empire shall remain a large player on the world stage. Therefore, we should align ourselves more closely with the Imperial Sphere of Influence."
AET_imperial_politics:0 "Align with the Empire"

AET_imperial_adivosrs_desc:0 "The Imperial military is very well structured and uses advanced tactics and doctrines. By sending some of our officers to study Imperial military strategy, we should be able implement many new tactics and doctrines into our armed forces."
AET_imperial_industry:0 "Invite Imperial Industrialists"
AET_imperial_industry_desc:0 "Our economy is poor and underdeveloped, and most foreign investors have little interest in Greifwald. Owing to our diplomatic ties with the Empire, we may be able to persuade some prominent Imperial industrialists to not only invest in Greifwald, but perhaps even serve as advisors for our government. This will not solve all of our economic problems, but it should allow our economy to recover to some degree."
AET_imperial_economic_help:0 "Request Imperial Economic Aid"
AET_imperial_economic_help_desc:0 "Although the Greifwaldian economy has improved thanks to our Imperial friends, there is still a lot of room for improvement. The Empire may be willing to provide significant economic relief to us if we increase our diplomatic efforts and pledge to support the Empire in the future."
AET_develop_imperial:0 "Imperial Development"
AET_develop_imperial_desc:0 "The Griffonian Empire has agreed to launch an industrial development plan for Greifwald, including significant investments into our industry and scientific base.

AET_imperial_guarantee:0 "Friends in the Palace"
AET_imperial_guarantee_desc:0 "The Griffonian Empire has done much for our economy, and we have openly stated our political support. Until now however, the Empire has not made any official proclamations of support with Greifwald. It may be time to ask the Imperials to change this, with the Empire officially guaranteeing our independence. "
AET_imperial_forts:0 "The Enemy to the South"
AET_imperial_forts_desc:0 "With our close ties to the Griffonian Empire, it is sadly quite possible that we may be drawn into a conflict with the Kingdom of Aquileia and her allies. Fortifying our southern border with bunkers, walls and trenches could prove to be an investment into the continuing sovereignty of Greifwald."
AET_align_aquileia:0 "Work with the Aquileians"
AET_align_aquileia_desc:0 "The Griffonian Empire may have been the strongest power on the continent once, but those days are long gone. It is very likely that the Kingdom of Aquileia will become the dominant power in Griffonia, and so we should seek cooperation with the Aquileians."
AET_aquileian_arms:0 "Import Aquileian Weaponry"
AET_aquileian_arms_desc:0 "As the Greifwaldian industrial base is quite small, it may be in our best interest to purchase some weapons from the Aquileians. This will allow us to arm more griffins for any potential conflict. Importing a large stockpile of small arms and a few artillery pieces seems to be the most sensible course at the moment."
AET_aquileian_adivosrs:0 "Aquileian Military Mission"
AET_aquileian_adivosrs_desc:0 "The Aquileian Military is one of the most advanced in the world. It may be possible to organise a joint military mission with the Aquileian high command. We would be able to learn a lot of new tactics and doctrines for our own military."
AET_aquileian_politics:0 "Align With the Aquileians"
AET_aquileian_politics_desc:0 "Aligning ourselves more closely with the Aquileian sphere of influence is our best hope for the future. It is clear they are the new major power on the Griffonian continent, and strengthening our ties with them is sure to be beneficial."
AET_aquileian_industry:0 "Invite Aquileian Industrialists"
AET_aquileian_industry_desc:0 "While it might be difficult to convince Aquileians to invest into Greifwald, it would not only improve our economy, but also bind us closely to Aquileia. This would help our diplomatic and political standing on the world stage."
AET_aquileian_economic_help:0 "Request a Loan from Aquileia"
AET_aquileian_economic_help_desc:0 "The Aquileian economy is much larger than that of Greifwald. Due to our recent leanings into the Aquileian sphere of influence, we may be able to convince them to loan us a large amount of money at a token interest rate. This would allow us to improve our economy and industry, and reduce the poverty amongst our population."
AET_develop_aquileian:0 "Aquileian Development Assistance"
AET_develop_aquileian_desc:0 "Our heavy industry is still lacking, despite all our efforts. But now that we have close ties to the Aquileian economy, we are in a position to change this.

AET_aquileian_guarantee:0 "A Friendship with the Eagles of the West"
AET_aquileian_guarantee_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Aquileia and her allies are more then capable of protecting the sovereignty of Greifwald from any foreign power. The Aquileians may be willing to sign a formal decree guaranteeing the independence of Greifwald from any would-be invaders."
AET_aquileian_forts:0 "The Enemy in the North"
AET_aquileian_forts_desc:0 "We are now formally in the Aquileian sphere of influence, and as such, the possibility of conflict with the Griffonian Empire looms over our heads. Fortifying our northern border will allow us to stop any Imperial incursion into Greifwald before it even begins."
AET_coqnuer_HEL:0 "Reclaim Adelart"
AET_coqnuer_HEL_desc:0 "The territories of Lissay and Eagletown, now composing the nation of Adelart,  have been an integral part of Greifwald for centuries, before they were taken from us less than 20 years ago. Many griffins living there are still loyal to the Greifwaldian nation, but the government of Adelart will not agree to unification on our terms. If we must take what is ours by force, than so be it."
AET_core_HEL:0 "Reintegrate Adelart"
AET_core_HEL_desc:0 "Now that we have secured all of the former territories of Adelart, we should begin to re-integrate the population there into Greifwald. The region has been terribly mismanaged under the Adelartian leadership, and the sooner we fix this, the better."
AET_develop_country:0 "Rebuild the Nation"
AET_develop_country_desc:0 "All of Greifwald is united now, at least on paper. But sadly, the former Adelartian lands of Lissay and Eagletown are lagging behind in most fields. With a significant investment, it should be possible rebuild the industry of our nation to it's former glory, before we were separated."
AET_new_country:0 "Springtime for Greifwald"
AET_new_country_desc:0 "The Unification of Greifwald has had a tremendous effect on our nation: for the first time in decades, the griffins of Greifwald can be proud of their nation, and support for our government is at an all-time high. We must capitalise on this, and lead the Greifwaldian people into a new age of happiness and prosperity."
AET_new_army:0 "Form the Greifwaldian National Army"
AET_new_army_desc:0 "Since the successful war of unification, support for the military is at an all-time high, and many griffins are joining the military every day. Now that a true Greifwaldian nation exists, we can launch a significant expansion of our military. Greifwald shall never be divided again."
AET_new_science:0 "Offer Citizenship to Foreign Scientists"
AET_new_science_desc:0 "The World has grown very dangerous in the last decades, and many foreign scientists are looking for a stable nation in which they can take up residence. By extending offers of citizenship to scientists living in unstable and war-torn nations, we can significantly improve our scientific base."
AET_invite_scientists:0 "A Haven for the Sound of Mind"
AET_invite_scientists_desc:0 "Many scientists have taken up our offer of citizenship, but we can still improve upon this number. By granting significant subsidies to scientists and giving them more protection under the law, we can make Greifwald even more attractive to intelligent people looking for a safe haven."
AET_land_reform:0 "Massive Agricultural Reforms"
AET_land_reform_desc:0 "Our heavy industry has improved significantly, but our agriculture is still lagging behind in many fields. We must fix this as soon as possible and start a massive reform of our agriculture. This "Agricultural Revolution" will make our agricultural industry one of the most advanced on the continent."
AET_further_development:0 "An Industrial Heartland"
AET_further_development_desc:0 "The state of Twöchanerwald has the weakest industry in all of Greifwald, but this can be changed. The thick forest will allow us to establish a large lumber industry there, which should in turn attract more investors."
AET_immigration_act:0 "Loosen Immigration Laws"
AET_immigration_act_desc:0 "Many people, griffins and others, seek to emigrate their native land in search of a better place to live. We have the industry and agriculture to support a very large population, and so we could take advantage of thousands of immigrants. But first, a loosening of our immigration laws is in order."
AET_expand_armouries:0 "State Funded Armouries"
AET_expand_armouries_desc:0 "The recent recruitment drive has, sadly, created a new problem: Our ever-growing military needs more weapons and equipment than we are capable of producing at the moment. We should set up large armouries and expand our heavy industry to make sure our soldiers have all the equipment they need."
AET_archonate_help:0 "Request the Help of the Prelate"
AET_archonate_help_desc:0 "In times of trouble like this Griffons turn to their faith for strength. Our government has no opinion on this one way or the other, but the local Prelate, Ludwig Ebonwing, certainly does. He seems to be proposing many interesting economic and political ideas. Perhaps we should take advantage of this."
AET_knighly_order:0 "Invite the Knights of Arcturius"
AET_knighly_order_desc:0 "The Knights of Arcturius have long been seen as an honourable force for good with not a hint of corruption among their various chapters. Indeed, the very idea of such Griffons pledging themselves to evil is mind-boggling. Perhaps it's time we bring these fine fellows in to teach people a thing or two."
AET_paramilitaries:0 "Organise Militias"
AET_paramilitaries_desc:0 "Now that sterling noble Griffons of unquestionable character and not a hint of heresy are backing the government it's time for the commoners to join in the new military. A militia of mighty Griffons of valour shall be formed, and among them not a single cultist shall be found. This new divine military shall surely help us."
AET_church_help:0 "Economic Assistance from the Gods"
AET_church_help_desc:0 "It's a well known fact that mortals are pants when it comes to finance. If it weren't the case, would the Empire have fallen apart the moment the Idol of Boreas was lost? Thus, it is logical to seek divine inspiration in money matters, especially when being specific about prayers."
AET_church_jobs:0 "Borean Development Plan"
AET_church_jobs_desc:0 "Boreas is the god of finance, despite evidence to the contrary. Thus it makes sense to model our new economy in his image, and not some other figure's image. Evidence to the contrary is nonsense."
AET_church_coup:0 "The Prelate's Takeover"
AET_church_coup_desc:0 "This was a mistake, a horrible mistake. We were wrong about the Prelate, he's not our friend, he's an enemy of all life, he's--[STATIC]-- For the good of the nation the Prelate has seized control of the government. Do not be alarmed, for all is well now."
AET_church_industry:0 "The Prelate's Industrial Plan"
AET_church_industry_desc:0 "Prelate Ebonwing's new economic development plan is the greatest possible for the nation, and so must be implemented unquestioningly."
AET_church_arms:0 "Temple Armouries"
AET_church_arms_desc:0 "Prelate Ebonwing has declared that temples must cease being means merely of peace, and must fully dedicate themselves to the task of national defence. Any disobedience by heretics who seek a non-violent solution shall be dealt with harshly."
AET_language:0 "Enforce the Imperial Dialect"
AET_language_desc:0 "The Imperial Dialect of our language is the most glorious dialect of our language to have ever been spoken, and any words to the contrary are heresy. Reports from test classes of bleeding from the ears when speaking backwards or in anagrams is also heresy."
AET_church_research:0 "Godly Researchers"
AET_church_research_desc:0 "It's time for our scientists to face facts that they will never be as good as the divine, and so must submit to being their research in re-purposed temples or else. On the plus side for them, this will grant them more space for more experiments and indeed this is already happening. The mutations are a normal side effect of science, make no mistake."
AET_paramilitaries_2:0 "Expand the Militia System"
AET_paramilitaries_2_desc:0 "It's time to expand the militia system previously implemented, even if we have to scrape the bottom of the barrel to do it. Those brigands and convicts are sure to be turned into upstanding Griffons, and make no mistake about it, they are not being used for some ulterior motive."
AET_destroy_HEL:0 "Destroy Adelart"
AET_destroy_HEL_desc:0 "Those confounded Adelartians with their stupid hats and their stupid smug grins have gone too far this time! We must destroy them, and annex their petty county too!"
AET_fatherland_calls:0 "Answer the Fatherland's Call"
AET_fatherland_calls_desc:0 "It is time to return to the Empire, integrating our county and its government into the larger whole. This is the end of the line for our independence, but it is for the best. After all, just imagine how far a loyal servant of the Empire can get into the halls of power . . ."
AET_madness_calls:0 "[Root.GetMadnessCallsFocusName]"
AET_madness_calls_desc:0 "[Root.GetMadnessCallsFocusDesc]"
AET_madness_calls_real:0 "Whispers in the Dark..."
AET_madness_calls_real_desc:0 "The hallways twist into shapes too natural to be made by Griffons, the walls bleed purple blood, time seems to flow backwards into nonsense speak, the one called Maar reveals himself, and only Prelate Ebonwing can hear this. Is this madness, or the sign of something otherworldly? Functionally, does it make any difference?"
AET_madness_calls_fake:0 "Fight for Independence"
AET_madness_calls_fake_desc:0 "For too long we have suffered under the faithless of Griffenheim! We shall make [Root.GetName] a free and godly nation under the Prelate, no matter the cost!"


AET_kill_knights:0 "Get Rid of the Arcturian Knights"

AET_invade_AVI:0 "Destroy the Avian Heretics"
AET_invade_AVI_desc:0 "The foolish and small House of Avia thinks they can get away with the crime of existence outside our borders, but they are wrong. Death shall come to them swiftly and without remorse."
AET_take_AVI:0 "Burn the False Idols"
AET_take_AVI_desc:0 "In their arrogance the Avian fools thought they could get away with worshipping anyone other than Maar, and for that time we shall burn their idols along with their children."
AET_invade_POM:0 "Strike Down the Pomovarrans"

AET_take_POM:0 "Strike Down the Heretics"
AET_take_POM_desc:0 "Now that we have secured the land we must prevent the Pomovarrans from ever rising up against us. Orthodoxy is heresy, death is life, evil is good. They must learn to accept these truths."
AET_annex_FLO:0 "Burn Flowena"
AET_annex_FLO_desc:0 "The city-state of Flowena has long been praised for its beauty. With this compliment they insult our altars and sacrificial daggers, and so must be brought to heal. We shall turn the entire city into an altar make them all pass through the fire."
AET_take_FLO:0 "Coerce the Heathens"
AET_take_FLO_desc:0 "To make sure the survivors know their place we shall implement mandatory beatings and executions.

AET_enslave:0 "Enslave the Heretics"
AET_enslave_desc:0 "While sacrifices are preferred, that is not always the most productive way to further the struggle. Setting up work camps shall allow us to both kill them and get something out of them before the end. We shall also legalise every other kind of slavery to make sure there is always an underclass to exploit for Maar."
AET_will_of_maar:0 "Spread the Will of Maar"
AET_will_of_maar_desc:0 "We must continue to attack all those who stand against us, and all stand against us. Thus our attacks must never stop, they must be ever happening. War isn't just a way, it is the only way."
AET_warriors_of_maar:0 "Let Loose the Warriors of Maar"
AET_warriors_of_maar_desc:0 "By removing our military from any legal or moral restrictions we can allow them to fully take advantage of their natural brutality. The only remaining law for them shall be to have unquestioning devotion to the Archon who speaks for Maar. Other than that, they can eat meat pie."
AET_industrial_1:0 "Begin Industrial Development Plans"
AET_industrial_1_desc:0 "The Greifwaldian industry is extremely lacking at the moment, and poverty is widespread. In order to fix the many issues the nation faces, we should begin drafting plans for the growth of our economy."
AET_infra_development:0 "Forest Roads"
AET_infra_development_desc:0 "Much of the nations countryside consists of forests, which are difficult to traverse. Constructing basic new roads going through the forests, we should be able to transport goods and materials more easily. This will increase our industrial and economic growth in the long run."
AET_oil:0 "Nationalise the Adelart Oil Fields"
AET_oil_desc:0 "Our newly acquired lands in Adelart are rich in oil, but the private sector is not exploiting this to it's fullest capacity. Bringing these oil fields under state control will allow us to maximise the amount of oil that is being extracted."
AET_oil_refineries:0 "Experiment With Synthetic Oil"
AET_oil_refineries_desc:0 "New advances in science may allow us to produce synthetic alternatives to oil. Needless to say, this would benefit our trade attractiveness and improve our industry drastically."
AET_oil_p:0 "Black Gold"
AET_oil_p_desc:0 "Our efforts to increase oil extraction have born fruit: Our oil industry is booming, and it doesn't show signs of stopping. It is believed that with increased funding, more synthetic oil can be produced. We will also be able to further expand the Adelart Oil Fields, and take advantage of any source that remains untapped. It is likely that the "Black Gold", as many Griffons have named it, will continue to flow for many decades more."
AET_industrial_2:0 "Modern Industrial Methods"
AET_industrial_2_desc:0 "With the advent of heavy machinery in recent decades, new industrial methods are being devised by scientist and industrialists. We should take advantage of this, and implement revolutionary new methods of production. This would certainly benefit our industry as a whole."
AET_steel_and_tungsten:0 "Expand the Cloudguard Mines"
AET_steel_and_tungsten_desc:0 "The hills in Cloudguard have always been rich in all kinds of metal, but this has not yet been exploited to its fullest extent. We should fix this as soon as possible, and significantly expand the scale of our mining operations in Cloudguard."
AET_steel_road:0 "Roads in the Forests"
AET_steel_road_desc:0 "Following the success of our new mining operations in Cloudguard, more materials are being transported all over the nation. We must now expand our forest road network again, in order to ease the strain on our infrastructure."
AET_more_steel:0 "Dig for Iron"
AET_more_steel_desc:0 "While doing construction work in Twöchanerwald for our recent infrastructure expansion, some engineers came across a small iron vein in the forest. If we can find the main vein, we should be able to construct mines there. This would allow us to increase our iron surplus and thus, our steel production. "
AET_radio:0 "Electronic Research"

AET_mechainsed_agriculture:0 "Mechanise Agriculture"
AET_mechainsed_agriculture_desc:0 "Heavy machinery can not be used only for war. Using tractors and other machines in our agriculture will increase our food surplus, which may in turn stimulate our economy."
AET_factory_buildup:0 "Industrial Buildup"
AET_factory_buildup_desc:0 "With our recent industrial advances, our economy is looking better than ever before. We should capitalise on this by building several new, state-of-the-art factories. This should allow us to increase our industrial capabilities even further."
AET_arms_building:0 "Develop the National Arms Industry"
AET_arms_building_desc:0 "In recent decades the World has grown to be very dangerous. In order to secure our sovereignty, a military buildup is in order. Investing in heavy industry should allow us to produce all the equipment we need to arm our soldiers."
AET_modern_soc:0 "Modernise the Industrial Sector"
AET_modern_soc_desc:0 "Despite our recent industrial growth, we are still lagging behind in some areas. We should provide additional funds to scientists in order to create a truly modern industrial sector."
AET_army_1:0 "Begin Reforming the Army"
AET_army_1_desc:0 "After the third or forth time someone tried to kill our beloved ruler from so far away they were but a speck on the horizon it came to our attention that our military was behind the times. We shall fix that."
AET_army_2:0 "Modern Support Equipment"
AET_army_2_desc:0 "Modern support equipment is more than a cot and a campfire, it's bandages, radios, shovels, binoculars, trucks, repair kits, and the training to use all of that. We have binoculars, but we could have much more."
AET_army_3:0 "Modern Rifles"
AET_army_3_desc:0 "Smokeless powder is an amazing. Not only does it do exactly what it sounds like, produce thrust for a bullet without generating much smoke, but it also produces enough power to throw rounds out to unprecedented ranges. How did we skip on this innovation for so long?"
AET_army_4:0 "Cannons from Abroad"
AET_army_4_desc:0 "Sometimes signing a cheque for something is easier than designing it yourself. That's the case with Griefwald's artillery. Contracting a foreign actor to get our guns up to snuff shall do much to improve our position."
AET_army_5:0 "Recycle the Old Guns"
AET_army_5_desc:0 "As tempting as it is to throw away all our old weapons for the shiny new ones we should keep cost concerns in mind. If we can adapt an old blackpowder rifle for smokeless cartridges for half the cost of building a new rifle from scratch why not take it? If nothing else it should cut down on training time."
AET_army_6:0 "Guns of the West"
AET_army_6_desc:0 "Artillery, the backbone of modern war. We new and better variants of these formidable weapons. Of that there can be no doubt."
AET_army_7:0 "A Rifle in Every Claw"

AET_army_8:0 "Exempt Scientists From Military Service"
AET_army_8_desc:0 "Our military's continued success depends are newer and better technology. We must never again lag behind the curve. To that end we must allow our scientists to go about their business without fear of draft letters coming in the mail."
AET_army_9:0 "Develop a Doctrine"
AET_army_9_desc:0 "We have a lot of great guns, but that's only half the equation. Information is ammunition, after all. It's time we gained the knowledge of how to properly deploy our arms."
AET_army_10:0 "Luna Nova Experiments"
AET_army_10_desc:0 "A group of our finest scientist-mages recently travelled to the Luna Nova Academy in Equestria. There they participated in an experiment to create enchanted crystals to power a Light Amplification by Simulated Emission of Radiation device. They have since returned our lands and brought with them the knowledge of what they learned. Apparently believing in ourselves is our magic. Nice!"
AET_army_13:0 "Enchanting!"
AET_army_13_desc:0 "They were right! Believing in ourselves was our magic, and it's time we rediscovered exactly what that means. We shall forge a shining chariot to break through the heavens with our magic! ... Metaphorically, of course."
AET_army_11:0 "An Army on Wheels"
AET_army_11_desc:0 "While griffon-pulled carts are great for airborne operations they leave something to be desired when each member of an artillery team needs a dedicated chiropractor. Motorised units promise to resolve those issues. All we have to go is get Griffons to accept moving on the ground."
AET_army_12:0 "Armoured Tractors and Tanks"
AET_army_12_desc:0 "The next evolution of vehicular combat is to put armour on-board to resist small arms fire. Of course, the obvious counter is to shoot them with big guns, like artillery. Therefor we must preemptively counter this counter with better engines and even more armour."
AET_army_14:0 "Establish the FMA"
AET_army_14_desc:0 "The Falcontown Military Academy has been proposed as the solution to the ever growing needs of our army to innovate. Perhaps it is time we do this. After all, knowing is half the battle."
AET_state_air:0 "Reclaim the Sky"
AET_state_air_desc:0 "For centuries Griffons have ruled the skies, but now our people are fat and lazy, and the sky is dominated by fantastic flying machines. We must reclaim out rightful place in the air, starting by building expanded airports to accommodate today's fixed-wing aircraft."
AET_air_1:0 "Hire New Pilots"
AET_air_1_desc:0 "Contrary to expectations, we can't just throw our overweight subjects into aircraft and tell them that its their new mobility scooter. We will actually have to hire Griffons with specialised training to fly these things. Lesson learned there."
AET_air_6:0 "Form Paratrooper Regiments"
AET_air_6_desc:0 "As technology advances and battle lines become ever more clear some of our number begin to see the value of specialised infantry trained to use transport aircraft to insert behind those lines. These 'paratroopers' should prove exceptionally useful for sowing confusion in enemy lines."
AET_air_7:0 "Jet Experiments"
AET_air_7_desc:0 "An article published in a scientific journal years ago proposed the idea of using compressed air being funnelled into a constant explosion as a means of propulsion. Perhaps it would be wise to invest in a better translation, and experiments to test the validity of the theory afterwards."
AET_air_2:0 "A New Pair of Wings"
AET_air_2_desc:0 "Light lighter aircraft are the most basic of combat capable aircraft that are actually meant to engage in combat, and it's time we invested into research for that."
AET_air_5:0 "Wings of Steel"
AET_air_5_desc:0 "Heavy fighters! Is there anything they can't do? Strategic bombing and dodging. Never mind that though, think of the versatility!"
AET_air_3:0 "A New Pair of Talons"
AET_air_3_desc:0 "It's time the ground griffs were given support from the air. What kind of support? Only the closest."
AET_air_4:0 "Talons of Steel"
AET_air_4_desc:0 "The time has come to remind our enemies what it feels like to have their cities reduced to ash. Granted, on this continent we're all pretty much used to it by now, but not being able to shoot back is a new experience!"
AET_navy_1:0 "Marry the Sea"
AET_navy_1_desc:0 "With our newfound access to the sea one thing is clear, we must do more than flirt with naval power. We must take it out to dinner, treat it right, and buy it a nice engagement ring. It's time we settle down to a lifetime commitment with the ocean."
AET_navy_10:0 "Expand the Dockyards"
AET_navy_10_desc:0 "It's time we applied all the new experience we got designing ships to expand the dockyards and make our navy even greater."
AET_navy_2:0 "A Small Fleet"
AET_navy_2_desc:0 "We love the ocean, is that not clear? However, it would be more advantageous take things slow. Let us buy an apartment first, then move on to something grander."
AET_navy_3:0 "Floating Fortresses"
AET_navy_3_desc:0 "Go big, or go home. We love the ocean, right? Well it's time we proved that by building the grandest fleet the world has ever known. Why buy a mansion when you can buy a palace, eh?"
AET_navy_4:0 "Deep Under the Sea"
AET_navy_4_desc:0 "Up on the shore they work all day. Indeed, out in the sun they slave away, and all while we're devoting full time to floating under the sea. Ain't the sub life grand?"
AET_navy_5:0 "A Surface Fleet"
AET_navy_5_desc:0 "Submarines are great at many things, but tracking other submarines is not one of them. To counter the enemy's sub we shall have to build up a destroyer fleet."
AET_navy_7:0 "Escort Buildup"
AET_navy_7_desc:0 "Torpedo capable fast moving vessels serve a wide variety of roles easily, and thus form the great majority of any fleet. It's time we joined the fun."
AET_navy_8:0 "Heavy Cruiser Experiments"
AET_navy_8_desc:0 "Heavy cruisers and battlecrusiers form a distinctive niche of vessels with large calibre guns that can actually move at a fair clip. We should get at least one new model of these vessels."
AET_navy_9:0 "A Storm of Steel"
AET_navy_9_desc:0 "Our shells shall blot out the sky, and shall be delivered by grand new battleships. None shall doubt our conviction to secure the seas."
AET_wave_one:0 "Friends From Across the Sea"
AET_wave_one_desc:0 "After the recent defeat of the main Changeling Hives on the Equestrian continent, we have received an intriguing offer by several former members of the Changeling high command. If we were to grant them sanctuary in Greifwald, they would be willing to provide our armed forces with invaluable know-how, as well as actively serve us in any potential conflict."
AET_changeling_fighters:0 "Bugs in the Sky"
AET_changeling_fighters_desc:0 "It is well known that the Changeling air force was one of the best in the world, prior to their defeat. There is a proposal to invite some of the former members of the changeling aeronautical forces to Greifwald. Not only would they bring valuable knowledge, but it may also be possible for them to acquire some high-quality bug-produced aircraft."
AET_strange_shipment:0 "Mysterious Shipments"
AET_strange_shipment_desc:0 "For a while now, huge crates of equipment have arrived by air in one of our military bases. This has lead to much confusion, as no one ordered anything of the like. Just a few moments ago, it was revealed that these shipments contain some former Changeling tanks, still in good quality! They were apparently ordered by a high-ranking Changeling exile. This is a great opportunity for us to improve our army."
AET_escape:0 "A Blind Eye"
AET_escape_desc:0 "Many Changelings are still on the run, having to flee their homeland because of simple ideological differences. And indeed, many of these bugs could be highly useful to the Greifwaldian nation. We should seek to set up ways to make it easier for "oppressed" Changelings to seek asylum in Greifwald. This will surely benefit our nation! After all, what could possibly go wrong?"
AET_army_leader:0 "Old Friends"
AET_army_leader_desc:0 "Following our great accommodation of the Changeling high command, even more former generals and soldiers have made their way to Greifwald in search of refuge. Our officer cadre is now composed of some of the greatest military minds the world has to offer, and we will benefit immensely by it, no doubt."
AET_changeling_science:0 "Invite the Scientists"
AET_changeling_science_desc:0 "Many brilliant Changeling researchers were forced to leave their home, simply because of their political views. We have already established ourselves as a haven for any and all free thinkers, provided they have talent. By inviting more bug scientists to Greifwald, we should be able to significantly improve our scientific base."
AET_definetly_legal_science:0 "Buggy Science"
AET_definetly_legal_science_desc:0 "Towards the end of the war, the changelings have made significant scientific advances in some fields that might be considered...unorthodox. We could capitalise on this, and perhaps uncover great potential for ourselves, but it will require some...bending of the laws of Greifwald. Of course, in the long run it will definitely be worth it."
AET_changeling_industrialists:0 "Invite the Entrepreneurs"
AET_changeling_industrialists_desc:0 "Many important Changeling entrepreneurs were forced to flee their home, but many managed to liquidate their assets, thus allowing them to retain most of their wealth. These bugs are now looking for new countries not only to settle in, but also to invest. This could be a golden opportunity for us to improve our industry."
AET_weird_lord:0 "A Change of Pace"
AET_weird_lord_desc:0 ""My fellow Griffons of Greifwald, I, Count Cloudet, am speaking to you today to ensure you all that any rumours of sudden changes in my demeanour are completely unfounded. I have simply been very busy lately, and it seems that the stress is getting to me. But fear not, due to our Changeling allies and their assistance, I am still able to fully administer our great nation. Worry not, citizens, for all will be well.""

AET_raise_dead:0 "The Dead Shall Serve"
AET_raise_dead_desc:0 "As Darkness and Death spreads throughout the land, Maar calls out to the dead bodies that lie upon the vast battlefields. Soulless and puppets to Maar himself, the Undead shall rise and march upon the heathens."
AET_pave_the_path:0 "Pave the Path"
AET_pave_the_path_desc:0 "The need for Sacrifice grows ever larger. It is time to tap into our 'reserves'. Maar will have his mortal blood delivered, and the weak souls of our society shall pay the price."
AET_portal_to_the_aether:0 "A Gate into the Aether"
AET_portal_to_the_aether_desc:0 "The Depths of the Aether would scare many... but not us. We have entered a pact with Death and Darkness itself, embraced it fully. We have become Maar's children, his favoured ones. And even now, our Crusade to consume the world with Darkness and rid it of life is not complete."

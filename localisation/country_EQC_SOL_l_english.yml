 #Reorganize Government Path
 EQC_SOL_reorganise_the_government:0 "Reorganise the Government"
 EQC_SOL_reorganise_the_government_desc:0 "A growing number of MPs within the New Mareland Congress have criticised our government's alignment with Empress Celestia.\n\n In response, Governor General [EQC.GetLeader] has called for fresh elections, on an unspecified date in the near future.

 EQC_SOL_increase_transoceanic_trade_desc:0 "There has been a recent wave of instability across the Griffon World with, what seems like, two out of every three governments falling to regimes which nationalise foreign assets. This has created a desire amongst Equestrian capitalists to move their operations, on the Griffon continent, to somewhere with even a hair of stability."

 EQC_SOL_extend_working_hours:0 "Extend Working Hours"
 EQC_SOL_extend_working_hours_desc:0 "We are in the middle of a crisis and it is up to every able-bodied Pony to give it their all if we wish to weather this storm. We may not like living in a culture of ten-hour workdays and mandatory overtime, but it beats the hell out of living under the jackboot of tyranny."

 EQC_SOL_econ_1:0 "Infrastructure Investments"
 EQC_SOL_econ_1_desc:0 "The lands of New Mareland are huge, rich, and bountiful. Yet, we are denied access to this wealth by a poor infrastructure network which prohibits the transport of goods effectively.\n\n In order to address this, we need to make significant investments into building and upgrading our rail and road networks."

 EQC_SOL_econ_2:0 "Heavyhoofed Market Intervention"
 EQC_SOL_econ_2_desc:0 "The Great Depression proved that the invisible hoof of capitalism is not without its flaws. It is a system in which commodity prices fluctuate, banks fail, and dumb luck wipe out thousand of jobs.\n\n Safeguards must be put in place to ensure economic hardship never returns."

#Pacify the State Focuses
 EQC_SOL_pacify_the_state:0 "Pacify the State"
 EQC_SOL_pacify_the_state_desc:0 "There has been growing instability amongst our populace since the proclamation of the Solar Empire.

This bill would put in place a limited form of conscription to hopefully ease the Ponypower issues within our military."

 EQC_SOL_begin_stabilization:0 "Begin Stabilisation"
 EQC_SOL_begin_stabilization_desc:0 "The riots have ended, protesters have returned home, and our opposition has been jailed.

 EQC_SOL_pardon_researchers:0 "Pardon Researchers"
 EQC_SOL_pardon_researchers_desc:0 "Many of the colony's greatest intellectuals were amongst the opposition to our government.

It is hoped that by releasing them, they will see our mercy and return to a life of science rather than politics."

 EQC_SOL_autarky:0 "Solar Autarky"
 EQC_SOL_autarky_desc:0 "New Mareland is an expansive realm with all manner of natural resources. This means, that in the event of war, our government can easily switch over to a policy of self-sufficiency. Still, it can never hurt to prepare and develop our self-sufficient programs in advance."

 EQC_SOL_press_censorship_desc:0 "The New Manehattan Times calls us dictators while the Sunset Gazette claims were autocrats.\n\n If these papers wish to stoke the embers of rebellion, with their slander, then we have no choice but to treat them like the enemies they are."

 #Joint Pacify/Embrace Focuses
 EQC_SOL_purge_the_military:0 "Purge the Military"
 EQC_SOL_purge_the_military_desc:0 "Many of our officers are carryovers from the pre-crisis days.

 EQC_SOL_unified_command:0 "Unified Solar Command"
 EQC_SOL_unified_command_desc:0 "Currently the high commands of the Solar Empire and New Mareland are fragmented into two separate entities.

 EQC_SOL_embrace_the_sun:0 "Embrace the Sun"
 EQC_SOL_embrace_the_sun_desc:0 "The empress provides us with light and with her light we are allowed warmth, food, and peace.

 EQC_SOL_solar_reinforcements:0 "Solar Reinforcements"

 EQC_SOL_centralize_the_state:0 "Centralise the State"
 EQC_SOL_centralize_the_state_desc:0 "The Congress of New Mareland lacklustre support for the empress, as our MPs continue to stall key legislation.\n\n If these Ponies will not do their duty, then we have no choice but to dissolve the Congress and centralise the apparatus of state upon the office of Governor General."

 EQC_SOL_let_the_sun_judge_them:0 "Let the Sun Judge Them!"
 EQC_SOL_let_the_sun_judge_them_desc:0 "Common Law has been suspended, being replaced by a new system of courts centred around devotion and loyalty to the empress. These courts are meant to weed out those with less then perfect devotion and their judges are known to hold rather medieval views on how to deal with criminals."

 EQC_SOL_redemption_through_labour:0 "Redemption Through Labour"
 EQC_SOL_redemption_through_labour_desc:0 "While many of the more radical Ponies to go through the Solar Courts end up dead, there is a significant portion who are found guilty of lesser offences.

 EQC_SOL_reward_loyal_researchers_desc:0 "The vast majority of our supposed intellectuals came out in opposition to the Empress.

 EQC_SOL_destroy_shadowbolts:0 "Destroy the Shadowbolts"
 EQC_SOL_destroy_shadowbolts_desc:0 "The Shadowbolt Society is as old as New Mareland itself. A secretive organisation which operates from the shadows in order to manipulate the affairs of state to benefit of its members. They have been adamantly opposed to the empress' rule and offer our last thorn of resistance."

 EQC_SOL_solar_economy:0 "Industry of the Light"
 EQC_SOL_solar_economy_desc:0 "We are loyal subjects to the Equestrian Crown as our lands now stand free of all traitors. There are none who would dare stand against the empress and our devotion to her remains unwavering.

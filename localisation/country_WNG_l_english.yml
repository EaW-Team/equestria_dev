 ### FASCIST ###
 WNG_march_on_karthin:0 "March on Karthin"
 WNG_march_on_karthin_desc:0 "Beakolini's Blackwings plan to march on Karthin in an attempt to seize power.

 WNG_meet_with_beakolini:0 "Meet with Beakolini"

 WNG_trains_run_on_time:0 "Make the Trains Run on Time"
 WNG_trains_run_on_time_desc:0 "A tardy train is annoying, but a dozen late trains per day is economically unsustainable.

 WNG_crack_down_on_communists:0 "Crackdown on the Communists"
 WNG_crack_down_on_communists_desc:0 "We may have gained control of the cabinet, but we still have the issue of a dangerously polarised and militarised left. Beakolini and his ministers can pass legislation that will slowly curb the communists' powers. Prevention beats the cure, after all..."
 WNG_secure_parliament:0 "Secure the Parliament"
 WNG_secure_parliament_desc:0 "The communists have been taken care of, but our position isn't secure yet. We do not have a parliamentary majority, and the opposition could form a coalition against us. By introducing new majority polcies, we can ensure full control over the parliament."

 WNG_glory_to_wingbardy_desc:0 "Wingbardy has long since been the jewel of the South. Since the first days of the Empire, our great nation has been the envy of all Griffons, a beacon to look up to.

 WNG_subdue_old_allies:0 "Subdue Old Allies"
 WNG_subdue_old_allies_desc:0 "Talouse, Arantiga and Franmistria all share cultural ties with Wingbardy. If we were to unite into a single state, we'd be the most powerful Griffon state of the South. Let's make that into reality."
 WNG_reapproch_falcor:0 "Reapproch Falcor"
 WNG_reapproch_falcor_desc:0 "There is bad blood between Wingbardians and Falcorians, and with good reason. It's time to settle our differences and reconcile with our former enemy."

 WNG_claim_the_throne:0 "Claim the Throne"
 WNG_claim_the_throne_desc:0 "The Empire has long since been a shadow of its former self, and an embarrassment to all of Griffon Kind. Perhaps the only way to restore its ancient glory is to let a Southener to take the throne."
 WNG_wingbard_empire:0 "Wingbardian Empire"
 WNG_wingbard_empire_desc:0 "Why should our prestige be sullied by the failing Empire of the North? Wingbardy has shown its strength and unity. Declaring our own, Southern Empire will send a far more powerful message than having a Wingbardian on the old and decrepit throne."

 WNG_public_works_projects_desc:0 "With order now re-established, it is time for Wingbardy to deal with its underperforming economy. By subsidising national public works, we can immediately address the unemployment. It'll take some time for the economy to recover fully, however."
 WNG_national_food_act:0 "National Food Act"

 WNG_pressure_the_colonies:0 "Liberate the Ponies"
 WNG_pressure_the_colonies_desc:0 "While some scoff at the idea of ponies being able to thrive under a socialist system, we cannot overlook the fact that Griffons are under foreign rule. We're a peaceful nation, so we'll offer the Equestrians the choice: relinquish Griffon lands, or face war."

 ### FASCIST ###
 WNG_march_on_karthin:0 "March on Karthin"
 WNG_march_on_karthin_desc:0 "Beakolini's Blackwings plan to march on Karthin in an attempt to seize power. The King's army can easily deal with the rabble, but there's no denying his popularity and his rhetoric might perhaps offer a way to escape the current political situation.\n\nHowever, no one is quite sure what the communists plan to do."
 WNG_meet_with_beakolini:0 "Meet with Beakolini"
 WNG_meet_with_beakolini_desc:0 "The King should offer Beakolini an invitation to meet with him. Perhaps this griffon will be the one that shall save the nation."

 WNG_crack_down_on_communists:0 "Crackdown on the Communists"
 WNG_crack_down_on_communists_desc:0 "We may have gained control of the cabinet, but we still have the issue of a dangerously polarised and militarised left. Beakolini and his ministers can pass legislation that will slowly curb the communists' powers. Prevention beats the cure, after all..."
 WNG_secure_parliament:0 "Secure the Parliament"
 WNG_secure_parliament_desc:0 "The communists have been taken care of, but our position isn't secure yet. We do not have a parliamentary majority, and the opposition could form a coalition against us. By introducing new majority policies, we can ensure full control over the parliament."
 WNG_education_reform:0 "Education Reform"

 WNG_only_fascism:0 "Fascism Only"

 WNG_glory_to_wingbardy_desc:0 "Wingbardy has long since been the jewel of the South. Since the first days of the Empire, our great nation has been the envy of all griffons: a beacon to look up to.

 WNG_go_it_alone:0 "Better Alone"
 WNG_go_it_alone_desc:0 "What have Talouse, Arantiga and Francistria done for us? Maintaining this fruitless alliance only shows that we are still weak. Let's show the world just how strong Wingbardy has become!"
 WNG_southern_sociaty_of_science:0 "Southern Society of Science"
 WNG_southern_sociaty_of_science_desc:0 "The Southern States were once the home of the greatest of griffon minds. We should build a united research and development society to help bring us back to the forefront of the world."

 WNG_subdue_old_allies_desc:0 "Talouse, Arantiga and Francistria all share cultural ties with Wingbardy. If we were to unite into a single state, we'd be the most powerful griffon state of the South. Let's make that into reality."
 WNG_reapproch_falcor:0 "Solidify Falcor"
 WNG_reapproch_falcor_desc:0 "The blood of over 460,000 Wingbardians was spilled in the Falcor War. While we did not start the war, through our might we brought the deceitful Falcorians to their knees. The city of Falcor was our prize.

 WNG_pressure_falcor:0 "Pressure Falcor"

 WNG_claim_griffonstone:0 "Claim Griffonstone"
 WNG_claim_griffonstone_desc:0 "With the South secured, the ancient cradle of all griffons lies before us. Griffonstone has long since languished in its torpor, and its former glory is but a faded memory. Under Wingbardian rule, we shall restore its prestige and add to ours!"
 WNG_claim_the_throne:0 "Claim the Throne"
 WNG_claim_the_throne_desc:0 "The Empire has long since been a shadow of its former self, and an embarrassment to all of griffon Kind. Perhaps the only way to restore its ancient glory is to let a Southerner to take the throne."
 WNG_wingbard_empire:0 "Wingbardian Empire"
 WNG_wingbard_empire_desc:0 "Why should our prestige be sullied by the failing Empire of the North? Wingbardy has shown its strength and unity. Declaring our own Southern Empire will send a far more powerful message than having a Wingbardian on the old and decrepit throne."

 WNG_rebuild_the_nation:0 "Rebuild the Nation"

Ever since the murder of his father in 971, Garibald Talonuel has led Wingbardy through times of both triumph and hardship. He was instrumental in the collapse of the Griffonian Empire, protected the south from Imperial aggression and united the nation through the long and bloody war with Falcor. Garibald Talonuel was also a prolific coin collector with over 100,000 coins in his private collection, each of them personally documented and studied. He left his collection to the National Karthinian Museum for all Wingbardians to enjoy.\n\nThe throne now passes to his son Prince Gumberto, who is a mere shadow of his father.

La Marcia Reale d'Ordinanza has been the national anthem for close to 100 years, but ever since Beakolini and his Fascist took power their own anthem, Giovinezza, has (often forcefully) supplanted it. Those loyal to the King see this as a great betrayal of Wingbardian tradition, but the King has remained silent on the issue. There is now a debate in parliament on whether la Marcia Reale d'Ordinanza should be officially replaced by Giovinezza as the official national anthem of the nation.\n\nIt is expected to go the Blackwing's way, after all, la Marcia Reale d'Ordinanza has no official lyrics while Giovinezza has such wonderful verses as \"With a Wingbardian's pride swear fealty to Beakolini\". This mandatory anthem is merely the griffons showing how much they love Il Duce. \n\nUnlike his father, Prince Gumberto has not remained silent on the issue. He has instead proposed La Leggenda del Piumave as a compromise. The popular song dates to the Falcor War and tales of the flooding of the river Piumave, halting Falcor's invasion of Wingbardy shortly after the disastrous battle at Clawporetto and how it allowed the Regio Esercito time to launch the counter attack required to push Falcor back and to final victory at the battle of Garibald Gergamo.\n\nWith the debate being held, who will carry the day?"

 wingbardy.144.d:0 "The foundation of the AGWP has not been an easy affair. Due to the poor economic situation of the kingdom, the project was originally underfunded. The original chairgriffon put in charge of the operation quickly departed for fear he was set up for failure or worse. In his stead emerged Genrico Gattei. Gattei was known as a rather crafty industrialist in Taloncana. Some of his ventures were impacted but instead of abandoning them like some others when the AGWP was created, he embraced it and began to lobby the government over participation in it. After all within the government began to see the position as doomed to fail, it was awarded to Gattei.\n\nUnder Gattei's leadership, the company was reorganised more efficiently along less bureaucratic lines. However, the budget of the AGWP was still an issue. Gattei's answer to it was the Taloncana scheme. With much fanfare and press coverage, he announced that incredibly rich methane and oil deposits were found in Taloncana and that soon, Wingbardy would become oil-independent. This quickly rose confidence in the company and many rich Wingbardians and capitalists began to buy into it, providing the company with some much-needed cash.\n\nThe reality was a bit less fantastic. Oil deposits were indeed found but they were very poor compared to the methane reserves. What he did was using natural gas instead to boost the development of national industry in the region. The gas would be a cheaper and more functional substitute for the all-important coal imported at great expenses. As many of these industry belonged to Gattei's family or friends, he benefited highly from the move. This could have been one of the greatest scandal in Wingbardian history but the move ultimately lead to a boom in the region and the high profits were plowed back into the various branches of the AGWP, allowing to grow even more and strike actual oil deposits.\n\nFar from getting fired over the scheme, Gattei became a media darling and a powerful political actor. Some are calling him corrupt and the move a threat to our government's integrity. Gattei prefers to call himself 'innovative'."

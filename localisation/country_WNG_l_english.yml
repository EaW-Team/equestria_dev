 ### FASCIST ###
 WNG_march_on_karthin:0 "March on Karthin"
 WNG_march_on_karthin_desc:0 "Beakolini's Blackwings plan to march on Karthin in an attempt to seize power. The King's army can easily deal with the rabble, but there's no denying his popularity and his rhetoric might perhaps offer a way to escape the current political situation.\n\nHowever, no one is quite sure what the communists plan to do."
 WNG_meet_with_beakolini:0 "Meet with Beakolini"

 WNG_trains_run_on_time:0 "Make the Trains Run on Time"
 WNG_trains_run_on_time_desc:0 "A tardy train is annoying, but a dozen late trains per day is economically unsustainable.

 WNG_crack_down_on_communists:0 "Crackdown on the Communists"
 WNG_crack_down_on_communists_desc:0 "We may have gained control of the cabinet, but we still have the issue of a dangerously polarised and militarised left. Beakolini and his ministers can pass legislation that will slowly curb the communists' powers. Prevention beats the cure, after all..."
 WNG_secure_parliament:0 "Secure the Parliament"
 WNG_secure_parliament_desc:0 "The communists have been taken care of, but our position isn't secure yet. We do not have a parliamentary majority, and the opposition could form a coalition against us. By introducing new majority polcies, we can ensure full control over the parliament."
 WNG_education_reform:0 "Education Reform"
 WNG_education_reform_desc:0 "We must instigate new education policies focused on the glory of Wingbardy's past and how best the young Griffons can dedicate themselves to making Wingbardy greater."
 WNG_only_fascism:0 "Fascism Only"

 WNG_glory_to_wingbardy_desc:0 "Wingbardy has long since been the jewel of the South. Since the first days of the Empire, our great nation has been the envy of all Griffons: a beacon to look up to.

 WNG_go_it_alone:0 "Better Alone"
 WNG_go_it_alone_desc:0 "What have Talouse, Arantiga and Franmistria done for us? Maintaining this fruitless alliance only shows that we are still weak. Let's show the world just how strong Wingbardy has become!"
 WNG_southern_sociaty_of_science:0 "Southern Society of Science"
 WNG_southern_sociaty_of_science_desc:0 "The Southern States were once the home of the greatest of Griffon minds. We should build a united research and development society to help bring us back to the forefront of the world."

 WNG_subdue_old_allies:0 "Subdue Old Allies"
 WNG_subdue_old_allies_desc:0 "Talouse, Arantiga and Franmistria all share cultural ties with Wingbardy. If we were to unite into a single state, we'd be the most powerful Griffon state of the South. Let's make that into reality."
 WNG_reapproch_falcor:0 "Reapproch Falcor"
 WNG_reapproch_falcor_desc:0 "There is bad blood between Wingbardians and Falcorians, and with good reason. It's time to settle our differences and reconcile with our former enemy."

 WNG_alliance_with_the_minotaurs_desc:0 "The Minotaurs have remained aloof on their islands, but with other fronts demanding our attention, they may take advantage of our split forces. Securing an alliance with Minotauria would secure our Eastern borders."
 WNG_demand_the_colonies:0 "Demand the Equestrian Colonies"
 WNG_demand_the_colonies_desc:0 "For too long the ponies of Equestria have had a hoofhold on our rightful lands. They oppress the native Griffons and exploit our riches for their own. We should demand the return of rightful Griffon lands."
 WNG_claim_griffonstone:0 "Claim Griffonstone"
 WNG_claim_griffonstone_desc:0 "With the South secured, the ancient cradle of all Griffons lies before us. Griffonstone has long since languished in its torpor, and its former glory is but a faded memory. Under Wingbardian rule, we shall restore its prestige and add to ours!"
 WNG_claim_the_throne:0 "Claim the Throne"
 WNG_claim_the_throne_desc:0 "The Empire has long since been a shadow of its former self, and an embarrassment to all of Griffon Kind. Perhaps the only way to restore its ancient glory is to let a Southener to take the throne."
 WNG_wingbard_empire:0 "Wingbardian Empire"
 WNG_wingbard_empire_desc:0 "Why should our prestige be sullied by the failing Empire of the North? Wingbardy has shown its strength and unity. Declaring our own, Southern Empire will send a far more powerful message than having a Wingbardian on the old and decrepit throne."
 ### NEUTRAL-FASCIST INDUSTRY ###
 WNG_public_works_projects:0 "Public Works Projects"
 WNG_public_works_projects_desc:0 "With order now re-established, it is time for Wingbardy to deal with its underperforming economy. By subsidising national public works, we can immediately address the unemployment. It'll take some time for the economy to recover fully, however."
 WNG_national_food_act:0 "National Food Act"
 WNG_national_food_act_desc:0 "Wingbardians may now have jobs, but they still lack food. If we can reinvigorate our own agriculture, we may be able to finally end this terrible famine and our dependance upon foreign exports."
 WNG_new_industrial_society:0 "Renewed Industries"
 WNG_new_industrial_society_desc:0 "Our economy is showing signs of recovery, but there is still much work to be done. With new investments to large corporations, our heavy industries will improve, as well as the overall economy of the country."

 WNG_rebuild_sociaty:0 "Rebuild Society"
 WNG_rebuild_sociaty_desc:0 "We have won the civil war, but our country lies shattered by it. By working with the remaining splinter parties, we can form a communist coalition and unify the left. Only then can we begin to heal the scars of war."
 WNG_rebuild_the_nation:0 "Rebuild the Nation"

 WNG_workers_collectives:0 "Workers' Collectives"
 WNG_workers_collectives_desc:0 "The country's rampant unemployment must be tackled, and we can begin to do so by forming strong labour unions and farming communes. This societal reform will not repair the problem in the short term, but it will bring about many benefits in the meantime."
 WNG_communist_education:0 "Communist Education"
 WNG_communist_education_desc:0 "We must re-educate society to understand and follow true communist ideals. Never again shall anyone think of themselves as more than just a cog in the communist machine."
 WNG_national_health_bureau:0 "National Health Bureau"
 WNG_national_health_bureau_desc:0 "For decades, the socialist parties of Wingbardy have called for a free, open and unified medical service for all Wingbardians.

 WNG_mines_for_miners:0 "Mines for the Miners"
 WNG_mines_for_miners_desc:0 "The dangerous occupation of the miner is now no longer under the ownership of the uncaring corporation. Mining unions will require government support to get started, but they will improve working conditions, morale and, most importantly, productivity."
 WNG_farms_for_farmers:0 "Farms for the Farmers"
 WNG_farms_for_farmers_desc:0 "The farms are now in the talons of the farmers. We should help them form collectives to ensure that they manage their own work for the benefit of themselves and all of Wingbardy."

 WNG_pressure_the_colonies_desc:0 "While some scoff at the idea of ponies being able to thrive under a socialist system, we cannot overlook the fact that Griffons are under foreign rule. We're a peaceful nation, so we'll offer the Equestrians the choice: relinquish Griffon lands, or face war."

 WNG_the_workers_empire_desc:0 "There is no real difference between a 'Wingbardian' worker and the worker of any other Griffon state. We are all united in our one effort to modernise our cities and communities. We are the true Griffon Empire: the Workers' Empire."
 ### Neutral ###
 WNG_stop_the_march:0 "Stop the March"
 WNG_stop_the_march_desc:0 "Beakolini's march is madness: he threatens the very stability of the nation. We cannot allow his band of thugs to seize power of our great nation. The police and army remains loyal to the king, and they will stop the march by any means necessary."

With mass defections within the army, the King has called on Beakolini to take command of the remaining forces to take on the rebels.\n\nModerates are polarising, and both sides will soon see waves of volunteers, leading to many expecting a long and violent civil war."

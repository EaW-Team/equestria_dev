 WNG_garibald_talonuel_iii_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 11th November 940, Karthin, Wingbardy.\n\n§YBiography§!: Known as the 'Soldier King' due to his leadership during the Falcor War, Garibald Talonuel III is well respected and beloved by the Wingbardian griffons. In 972 ALB his father, King Gumberto, was murdered in the Imperial Palace in Griffenheim while attending a party for the young Grover V. The newly crowned Garibald demanded justice but was given none. In protest he severed all ties with the Empire, declaring Wingbardy to be independent for the first time in in over over a century. The rest of the empire soon took Wingbardy's lead, quickly leading to the Empire's collapse.\n\nThe first few years of independence was prosperous for Wingbardy, however a border dispute with Falcor in 985 lead to four long and bloody years of conflict that scarred Wingbardy to this day. During the war, King Garibald Talonuel III was known to often visit the frontline and had significant support among his troops.\n\nHowever, the years since the war have only seen Wingbardy's situation grown worse. Failed government after failed government, along with a crippled economy, has lead to many Wingbardians demanding that he step in and find a way to resolve their situation. WIth the rise of Fascism and Communism, it became clear that only he could decide Wingbardy's future.\n\nHe sees his son, Gumberto, as a disappointment and secretly fears for the future of the monarchy unless his son can better himself. In the King's free time he is an avid stamp collector. His collection of postal stamps is the largest in the world.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Sinister"

So much Wingbardian blood was shed for only a few miles of Falcorian land and a single city devastated by the war.

 WNG_meet_with_beakolini_desc:0 "Beakolini's columns are nearly at the gates of Karthin, and something needs to be done. Confronting him would only lead to chaos though, and the question is whether he might not, in the end, be the bird we need to set Wingbardy back on course."

 WNG_wingbardian_stalliongrad_treaty:0 "Wingbardian - Stalliongrad Treaty"
 WNG_wingbardian_stalliongrad_treaty_desc:0 "Stalliongrad is a curious entity. Though they are in many ways the opposite to us, necessity makes for strange bedfellows.

 WNG_legitimise_the_blackwings_desc:0 "Beakolini's paramilitary organisation has been key to his political ambitions, and their loyalty to him above all other things is too valuable for the Duce to let go of. By signing their special status into law, the Duce will have his loyal warriors at his beck and call, no matter what happens."

 WNG_the_gacerbo_law:0 "The Gacerbo Law"
 WNG_the_gacerbo_law_desc:0 "Beakolini has achieved several of his goals, but the parliament keeps stymying his efforts. To counter this, he has motioned for a parliamentary reform, one that will tip the balance of the scales. A shame for the politicians that they will be powerless to stop it once the king gives his approval of it."

 WNG_accountable_only_to_the_king_desc:0 "All that Beakolini has done has one purpose and one purpose only: the prosperity and glory of Wingbardy. All other things are vestigal issues that cannot be allowed to stand in his way. That is why he will be beholden to the king only. If courts, politicians or other meddlers plan to drag him from his position, they can do so by force."

 WNG_the_grand_council_of_fascism_desc:0 "The bickering politicians almost brought Wingbardy to ruin, but that doesn't mean that the entire system is wholly rotten.

 WNG_beakolinis_education_reform:0 "Beakolini's Education Reform"
 WNG_beakolinis_education_reform_desc:0 "If Wingbardy is to prosper, she must ensure that her children are given a good education both physically and mentally.

 WNG_mass_public_works:0 "Mass Public Works"
 WNG_mass_public_works_desc:0 "Unemployment is a scourge not just economically, but morally as well.

 #### Politics ####
 POLITICS_GARIBALD_TALONUEL_DESC:0 ""
 POLITICS_BEAKOLINI_DESC:0 "Giulio Beakolini was born to a middle class family in 954, and from early age, he had a deep interest in politics. His family's republican leanings made them ardent supporters of the Republican Revolution in Griffonia, and their eventual defeat did not weaken, but rather intensify, young Giulio's support for the cause, especially the more radical left branches of the movement. During his younger years, he worked as a journalist and became a famous firebrand within the left wing of Wingbardian politics.\n\nThe Falcorian war, however, turned into a watershed moment for the young Beakolini, and unlike most of his peer, he was in full support of the war. Through it, he saw the workers being empowered through the fighting and a chance to bring together a divided land. This led to him being ostracized as a warmongerer, and he ended up fired, being told he could go fight the war himself if he viewed it as something good. Beakolini chose to take the insult literally and joined the Wingbardian army, where his zeal and determination let him become part of the elite Wingbardian Bersaglieri.\nWhen peace came, he was a changed griff, and whereas many had been broken on the battlefield, he had found his purpose. He returned to writing, only this time for his own ideology, and ever since then, he has tirelessly written for and organized his own political movement; the 'Blackwings'. He has realized that republicanism is weak and corrupt, socialism a false idol that will break apart the nation. The new path forward organizes the entire nation as one entity, where all griffs are soldiers for Wingbardy's glory. He has named this movement Fascism, and under it, he will see Wingbardy rise to become the master of Griffonia, or die trying.

His outspokenness against Beakolini's fascist movement has lead to many hoping for a quick crackdown of the Blackwings"

 WNG_trains_run_on_time:0 "Make the Trains Run on Time"
 WNG_trains_run_on_time_desc:0 "A tardy train is annoying, but a dozen late trains per day is economically unsustainable.

 WNG_crack_down_on_communists:0 "Crackdown on the Communists"
 WNG_crack_down_on_communists_desc:0 "We may have gained control of the cabinet, but we still have the issue of a dangerously polarised and militarised left. Beakolini and his ministers can pass legislation that will slowly curb the communists' powers. Prevention beats the cure, after all..."
 WNG_secure_parliament:0 "Secure the Parliament"
 WNG_secure_parliament_desc:0 "The communists have been taken care of, but our position isn't secure yet. We do not have a parliamentary majority, and the opposition could form a coalition against us. By introducing new majority policies, we can ensure full control over the parliament."
 WNG_education_reform:0 "Education Reform"

 WNG_news_censorship_desc:0 "The newspapers often spread pro-communist rhetoric, harmful to the Wingbardian people. Il Duce, who has won awards for his truthful and honest journalism, is now able to ensure that only the truth is shared with the griffons of the nation."
 WNG_glory_to_wingbardy:0 "Glory to Wingbardy"
 WNG_glory_to_wingbardy_desc:0 "Wingbardy has long since been the jewel of the South. Since the first days of the Empire, our great nation has been the envy of all griffons: a beacon to look up to.

 ### NEUTRAL-FASCIST DIPLO ###

 WNG_the_sicameon_question:0 "The Sicameon Question"
 WNG_the_sicameon_question_desc:0 "Sicameon has made it clear that they're not our friends. They have denounced our "anti-democratic" and "aggressive" policies. We should teach them a lesson of humility and remind the pathetic federation about who is the true ruler of the South!"
 
 WNG_subdue_old_allies:0 "Subdue Old Allies"
 WNG_subdue_old_allies_desc:0 "Talouse, Arantiga and Francistria all share cultural ties with Wingbardy. If we were to unite into a single state, we'd be the most powerful griffon state of the South. Let's make that into reality."
 WNG_reapproch_falcor:0 "Solidify Falcor"
 WNG_reapproch_falcor_desc:0 "The blood of over 460,000 Wingbardians was spilled in the Falcor War. While we did not start the war, through our might we brought the deceitful Falcorians to their knees. The city of Falcor was our prize. While Falcor was never truly defeated, more bloodshed is an unwelcome thought, but the city shall never be allowed to fall again."
 WNG_pressure_falcor:0 "Pressure Falcor"
 WNG_pressure_falcor_desc:0 "Falcor has always hated us ever since their defeat twenty years ago, and have continually pushed to regain their ancient capital. We must subdue the Falcorian threat, once and for all."

 WNG_demand_the_colonies:0 "Demand New Mareland"
 WNG_demand_the_colonies_desc:0 "For too long the ponies of Equestria have had a hoofhold on our rightful lands. They oppress the native griffons and exploit our riches for their own. We should demand the return of rightful griffon lands."
 WNG_claim_griffonstone:0 "Claim Griffonstone"
 WNG_claim_griffonstone_desc:0 "With the South secured, the ancient cradle of all griffons lies before us. Griffonstone has long since languished in its torpor, and its former glory is but a faded memory. Under Wingbardian rule, we shall restore its prestige and add to ours!"
 WNG_claim_the_throne:0 "Claim the Throne"
 WNG_claim_the_throne_desc:0 "The Empire has long since been a shadow of its former self, and an embarrassment to all of griffon Kind. Perhaps the only way to restore its ancient glory is to let a Southerner to take the throne."
 WNG_wingbard_empire:0 "Reform the Karthinian Empire"

 WNG_public_works_projects:0 "Public Works Projects"
 WNG_public_works_projects_desc:0 "With order now re-established, it is time for Wingbardy to deal with its underperforming economy. By subsidising national public works, we can immediately address the issue of unemployment. It'll take some time for the economy to recover fully, however."
 WNG_national_food_act:0 "National Food Act"
 WNG_national_food_act_desc:0 "Wingbardians may now have jobs, but they still lack food. If we can reinvigorate our own agriculture, we may be able to finally end this terrible famine and our dependence upon foreign exports."
 WNG_new_industrial_society:0 "Renewed Industries"
 WNG_new_industrial_society_desc:0 "Our economy is showing signs of recovery, but there is still much work to be done. With new investments to large corporations, our heavy industries will improve, as well as the overall economy of the country."

 WNG_rebuild_the_nation:0 "Rebuild the Nation"
 WNG_rebuild_the_nation:0 "The war has ravaged what little was left of our nation's industries and infrastructure. Now we have a chance to rebuild a true communist nation, and show that Wingbardy can rise stronger from the ashes."
 WNG_workers_collectives:0 "Workers' Collectives"
 WNG_workers_collectives_desc:0 "The country's rampant unemployment must be tackled, and we can begin to do so by forming strong labour unions and farming communes. This societal reform will not repair the problem in the short term, but it will bring about many benefits in the meantime."
 WNG_communist_education:0 "Communist Education"
 WNG_communist_education_desc:0 "We must re-educate society to understand and follow true communist ideals. Never again shall anyone think of themselves as more than just a cog in the communist machine."
 WNG_national_health_bureau:0 "National Health Bureau"
 WNG_national_health_bureau_desc:0 "For decades, the socialist parties of Wingbardy have called for a free, open and unified medical service for all Wingbardians. Now that the revolution has been won, we can make good on these promises by founding the National Health Bureau to oversee the well-being of all citizens."
 WNG_mines_for_miners:0 "Mines for the Miners"
 WNG_mines_for_miners_desc:0 "The dangerous occupation of the miner is now no longer under the ownership of the uncaring corporation. Mining unions will require government support to get started, but they will improve working conditions, morale and, most importantly, productivity."
 WNG_farms_for_farmers:0 "Farms for the Farmers"

 WNG_join_grw_desc:0 "Having fought hard to cast off the shackles of the old order, the [GRW.GetName] is perhaps the best example of a communist state and among one of the more powerful ones. With enemies on all sides, an alliance with the [GRW.GetName] will only be beneficial."
 WNG_free_the_bulls:0 "Liberate the Minotaurs"
 WNG_free_the_bulls_desc:0 "Asterion has long oppressed the labourers within its borders. We cannot stand idly any longer, and we shall install the rightful government, one way or another!"
 WNG_join_aquilia:0 "Join Aquileia"
 WNG_join_aquilia_desc:0 "Aquileia and its former autonomies have united into a socialist republic after a bloody revolution, and now stands to become the dominant power in the South-West. It would only make sense to approach them with offers of an alliance."
 WNG_divide_new_mareland:0 "Divide New Mareland"
 WNG_divide_new_mareland_desc:0 "The territories that are currently occupied by the colonial imperialists are rightfully Griffonian. We can reach to the local griffon populations and make them want for both Aquileian and Wingbardian rule. Out with the Equestrians!"

 WNG_our_own_way_desc:0 "There is no one that we can rely upon to free the working class except for ourselves. Wingbardy shall lead the revolution in the continent and beyond!"
 WNG_free_aquilian_workers:0 "Free the Aquileian Workers"
 WNG_free_aquilian_workers_desc:0 "The Aquileian proletariat is being stifled by their government, and thus not allowed to flourish as it has in Wingbardy. There can be no negotiation with the Aquileian state; the only way to achieve the liberation of the Aquileian is by force of arms."
 WNG_pressure_the_colonies:0 "Liberate the Ponies"
 WNG_pressure_the_colonies_desc:0 "While some scoff at the idea of ponies being able to thrive under a socialist system, we cannot overlook the fact that griffons are under foreign rule. We're a peaceful nation, so we'll offer the Equestrians the choice: relinquish griffon lands, or face war."
 WNG_the_workers_empire:0 "The Workers' Empire"
 WNG_the_workers_empire_desc:0 "There is no real difference between a 'Wingbardian' worker and the worker of any other griffon state. We are all united in our one effort to modernise our cities and communities. We are the true Griffonian Empire: the Workers' Empire."
 ### Neutral ###
 WNG_stop_the_march:0 "Stop the March"
 WNG_stop_the_march_desc:0 "Beakolini's march is madness: he threatens the very stability of the nation. We cannot allow his band of thugs to seize power of our great nation. The police and army remains loyal to the king, and they will stop the march by any means necessary."
 WNG_brake_the_political_deadlock:0 "Break the Political Deadlock"
 WNG_brake_the_political_deadlock_desc:0 "Enough is enough. It's time to end this political deadlock once and for all. The King will address parliament and demand that they produce results. Wingbardy needs leadership, and the King will provide it."

 WNG_librals:0 "Reinvigorate the Liberals"
 WNG_librals_desc:0 "The moderate left has often made its mark as a compromise between a conservative and a radical government. The King recognises the need for Wingbardy to start over, but will only step aside if the liberals do away with their more extreme ideas."
 WNG_embrace_harmony:0 "Embrace Harmony"
 WNG_embrace_harmony_desc:0 "Many of the PWd'A point to the stable country of Equestria over on Equus as a shining example of the concept of Harmony. Adopting a model similar to the Equestrians' may set Wingbardy on a path of restoring order."
 WNG_equestrian_aid:0 "Equestrian Aid"
 WNG_equestrian_aid_desc:0 "Having adopted Equestria's Harmonic form of government, we are in a good position to request aid from them. Being renowned for their bountiful food and giving disposition, it is highly likely Equestria will help us Wingbardians deal with the famine."

 WNG_pass_industrial_reforms_desc:0 "Now working with economic and social specialists that were traditionally left-wing, Wingbardian industry experts can set about to begin the long recovery from our economic and industrial stagnation."
 WNG_steel:0 "Privatise the Steel Industry"
 WNG_steel_desc:0 "In the past, steel and aluminium production had been government run, but have since been burdened by red tape. By allowing private companies to take over the mills with minimal government oversight, industry experts agree that our overall output will improve."
 WNG_lazius_fair:0 "Laissez-faire"
 WNG_lazius_fair_desc:0 "Following the Equestrians' lead we can lift most, if not all, of the redundant and restrictive regulations. By giving leeway to businesses and companies, the hope is for Wingbardy to see an amelioration of its economic and industrial output."
 WNG_equestrian_trade:0 "Equestrian Trade"
 WNG_equestrian_trade_desc:0 "With New Mareland as our neighbour, Wingbardy has an unique access to the Equestrian market overseas. It'd be foolish to not exploit this trade opportunity and improve our diplomatic standing with both Equestria and New Mareland."
 WNG_keep_our_friends_close:0 "Keep our Friends Close"
 WNG_keep_our_friends_close_desc:0 "With conflict intensifying abroad, Wingbardy cannot stand alone against our eventual foes. As such, we must reinforce our current alliance to ensure that we're not left alone. Even Falcor, our old enemy, may prove to be a useful ally."
 WNG_embrace_the_pony_way:0 "Embrace the Pony Way"
 WNG_embrace_the_pony_way_desc:0 "We have adopted so much from Equestria, why shouldn't we fully embrace their ways? Let the traditionalists and conservatives scoff at the idea - we know that ours is the only way to achieve true peace."

 WNG_school_for_gifted_griffons_desc:0 "Working with Equestria, we can establish a special academy in our nation that is inextricably linked to the famed Canterlot School for Gifted Unicorns. We may not have our own magic, but we have much to share with our pony kin as they do with us."

 WNG_harmony_with_griffon_characterises_desc:0 "We have striven to liken ourselves to the Equestrians, but there are hard, biological limits that makes our two species fundamentally different.

 WNG_arsenal_of_harmony:0 "Arsenal of Harmony"
 WNG_arsenal_of_harmony_desc:0 "With so much disharmony in the world, we cannot expect for things to be resolved peacefully. If Equestria won't step up, we shall be the ones to provide the arms to the righteous warriors fighting to achieve the peace that we're all after."
 WNG_cake_or_death:0 "Cake or Death"
 WNG_cake_or_death_desc:0 "It is clear that there are those who wish to sow the seeds of discord and watch the world burn. Wingbardians have always had good hearts, and we cannot abide those who purposefully seek to harm and destroy. We shall be the Blade of Harmony."

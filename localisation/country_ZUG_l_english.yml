### Starting tree focuses

ZUG_earth_celebration:0 "End the Celebration"
ZUG_earth_celebration_desc:0 "The year's celebration festival is drawing to a close. The ancestral spirits have been appeased and Gaia's birthday honoured, it is time for Ugabi to reenter its usual routine. Across the nation, Nnabakyala Mukia's subjects crowds the villages with baited breath for her heralds, while the capital awaits her arrival with baited breath."

ZUG_address_fears:0 "Fear of New"
ZUG_address_fears_desc:0 "It's a hard truth to swallow, but it's undeniable that Ugabi has, and remains far behind its northern and western neighbours, largely due to the population's aversion to change. Even small innovations, brought to Ugabi have raised fears from the citizenry, with Mukisa finding herself hardpressed to address their concerns."

ZUG_modern_innovations:0 "The Wonder Tools"
ZUG_modern_innovations_desc:0 "Internal combustion, motorized vehicles and the like are nothing new to the Ugabi population. However, recent developments have turned what was once used only martially, into a critical asset for the civilians, in the form of a tractor in the fields. Spurred by the success of this new tool, Mukisa wishes to acquire more, gifting them to her people at her wallets expense."

ZUG_western_railroad:0 "The Western Railroad"
ZUG_western_railroad-desc:0 "The Kamarela-Ruguzu railroad, a dream project of her late father, is now nothing but rusted iron and broken foundations after being razed during the Storm King's invasion. Mukisa had always wanted to rebuild it, but this cannot be done with the UCTA's control of the western regions. Yet, even if she could do that, what would stop the military from seizing control of it? Though, with the Summit approaching, said railroad could turn out to be a great weapon in her arsenal."

ZUG_eastern_fields:0 "The Eastern Marshes"
ZUG_eastern_fields_desc:0 "Most of the land in Karagaweze is comprised of wet, marshy, useless soil. Plans to drain the marshes and create farms have been planned for decades, yet none have come to fruition, making the population lose faith, driving them to support the Gulu clique. Mukisa declares openly that it is time to finally see the swamps drained."

ZUG_industrious_subjects:0 "Celebrate The Great Patriots"
ZUG_industrious_subjects_desc:0 "While there are many in the world who view Ugabi as a backwater, an undeveloped nation still stuck in the dark ages, there are many who work hard to improve these lands. The forward-thinking, industrious patriots should be remembered, their work celebrated."

ZUG_farmers_to_workers:0 "Protect the Workers"
ZUG_farmers_to_workers_desc:0 "The Gulu clique's promises of workers rights and fair rents, laws that protect zebras from abuse by their landlords have for a long time won them great favour in the eyes of the population. While these demands are fair and just, these so-called reformers only use these as excuses and lies built to destabilize the country. It is time to defang these dissidents by offering our working people the protection they desire."

ZUG_enflame_western_unrest:0 "Spread Whispers in the West"
ZUG_enflame_western_unrest_desc:0 "Under the tyrannical hoof of the UCTA, the western reaches of Ugabi have been ruins, turned to ash and dust. The soldiers there harass villages, commiting horrid crimes against our people, while any act of protest by the citizens is brutally crushed by these bandits. Yet, Mukisa knows her subjects will act if called upon, and the time to rise up draws ever nearer. When her highness gives the order, the UCTA will not know what hit them."

ZUG_discredit_clique:0 "Discredit the Clique"
ZUG_discredit_clique_desc:0 "The clique claims to be acting on behalf of the common zebra, to be goodhearted reformers seeking to save our people from their oppressors. In truth, these are all lies. The Gulu clique is an organization of megalomaniacs who will stop at nothing to get the power they seek, just like the UCTA. Mukisa shall let her subjects know the truth, letting her people decide for themselves the facts."

ZUG_sway_key_reformers:0 "New Friends, New Futures."
ZUG_sway_key_reformers_desc:0 "A letter arrived in the night, the messenger tired, his clothes ragged. He brings a requst for a secret meeting with a group of reformers who wish to treat with her in good faith. An opportunity she gladly accepts."

ZUG_entice_traders:0 "Entice the Traders"
ZUG_entice_traders_desc:0 "The desolation brought by the Storm King has left trade routes broken, caravans scattered. Yet a slow recovery has seen the trade networks re-open, linking Ugabi to the world at large. While it has filled the coffers of Ugabi, it has also introduced dangerous foreign ideas to our people. To counter this, Mukisa shall seek to align the traders to her reign with monopoly rights and lucrative tarrif exemptions."

ZUG_court_parlays:0 "The Court of Nnabakyala"
ZUG_court_parlays_desc:0 "As part of her daily duties, Mukisa holds court in her royal palace. One part of this a public forum where any subject can appeal to her for justice or seek wisdom. Behind the throne, however, ears are kept open for any ill rumours while lavish meetings are held for the influential to keep them loyal to the throne."

ZUG_hear_merchants:0 "Hear the Merchants"
ZUG_hear_merchants_desc:0 "A group of merchants has recently appealed to the throne for an amend to an edict concerning foreign trade. Mukisa shall listen to what they'll have to say and pass her judgement."

ZUG_modern_friends:0 "To A New Friendship!"
ZUG_modern_friends_desc:0 "Even if part of the traditional elite, Mukisa can feel where the wind is blowing; the ascendance of merchants who are learned in modern arts has created a new powerbase without ancient lineages. An asset that would be most useful in the future."

ZUG_listen_nobles:0 "Host the Nobles"
ZUG_listen_nobles_desc:0 "Part of Mukisa's duties is to host lavish parties for the nobles to showcase her wealth and power. One such party has been planned, and Mukisa intends for this one to be especially grand."

ZUG_traditional_allies:0 "To A Continued Alliance!"
ZUG_traditional_allies_desc:0 "As the old proverb goes, one should not play with fire. The ancient clans and capital nobility are an established powerbase and it would be foolish to risk their ire. Instead, Mukisa will ensure their loyalty and friendship to secure her plans."

ZUG_royal_authority:0 "Power of the Throne"
ZUG_royal_authority_desc:0 "Ugabi might be an union of many clans but there is only one Nnabakyala — and her name is Mukisa."

ZUG_charitable_leader:0 "One Who Cares for All"
ZUG_charitable_leader_desc:0 "The Nnabakyala have always cared for their subjects but has there ever been such a charitable leader lie Mukisa? Her wealth has seen the poor fed, roads constructed and the fields expand across the land. Her wealth is Ugabi's wealth, one and the same."

ZUG_liberation_icon:0 "One Who Led the Liberation"
ZUG_liberation_icon_desc:0 "Ugabi would never have been freed without the work of the venerated Mukisa. It was she who created the armed forces who pushed the invaders out. It was she who freed the slaves from their chains. Without her, there would be no Ugbai today and she will let her subjects know this."

ZUG_ancestral_guidance:0 "One With the Ancestors"
ZUG_ancestral_guidance_desc:0 "As it was and shall be, the Nnabakyala acts as the link between the living and the dead. Her person unites the present, past and the future into one being. Who would dare to question such a vessel of wisdom?"

ZUG_repay_loyalty:0 "Riches to the Loyal"
ZUG_repay_loyalty_desc:0 "TODO"

ZUG_royal_estates:0 "Loyal Subjects"
ZUG_royal_estates_desc:0 "Much land across Ugabi belongs to the throne and most are occupied by local farming communities. It is in these hovels and fields where the most loyal Ugabians dwell yet they are also the most forgotten. Now Mukisa will honour them, at last, for their generations of devoted duty and servitude."

ZUG_visible_monarchy:0 "Modern Approach"
ZUG_visible_monarchy_desc:0 "Mukisa has seen fit to become more approachable to her subjects all across Ugabi. While for years she has held festivals in the capital that have been commemorated by heralds in her name, she now wishes to speak to the directly with the help of modern technology."

ZUG_popular_sovereign:0 "Popular Sovereignty"
ZUG_popular_sovereign_desc:0 "No ruler cannot rule if their subjects oppose them. Mukisa has come to realize the power she can gain by garnering the support of her subjects directly instead of through the traditional chieftains. While they may retain their positions, the throne will become closer to its subjects and earn their unquestioning devotion."

ZUG_damned_traitors:0 "Damnation to the Traitor"
ZUG_damned_traitors_desc:0 "TODO"

ZUG_divine_agents:0 "Loyal Priesthood"
ZUG_divine_agents_desc:0 "Of all the factions in Ugabi, the priests of the Sky and various other religious officials remain staunchly loyal to Mukisa and the institution she stands for. Some have already taken the initiative to wield their influence over the masses by preaching loyalty to their Nnabakyala and how one must be ready to even cast aside their chieftains if they are to oppose her rule. Such forward thinking must be repaid."

ZUG_watchful_spirits:0 "Watchful Spirits"
ZUG_watchful_spirits_desc:0 "Us mortals cannot escape attention of our forebears even after their depature. They watch and protect us. Yet they also punish the wicked and cruel. To betray the Nnabakyala is a crime against the Sky himself and the traitor's soul is cast aside by the winds upon death, never to exist again. Who would risk such damnation?"

ZUG_blessed_dynasty:0 "Blessed By the God"
ZUG_blessed_dynasty_desc:0 "It is clear that the Sky favours Nnabakyala Mukisa. Her dynasty has ruled Ugabi since time immemorial, surviving while other rulers and clans have been vanquished. Now, she stands above all as a divinely ordained ruler, one who speaks with voice of countless ancestors and is connected to the god himself. To serve her is a privilege and every devout subject stands ready to fulfill her commands."

ZUG_absolutism:0 "My Name is Mukisa"
ZUG_absolutism_desc:0 "Ugabi is nothing without its ruler, and that ruler is Mukisa. Anyone who dares to oppose her rule is nothing but a filthy traitor who should be opposed at all costs. Her subjects are devoted to her and know that under her rule they will see Ugabi rise in glory over the others."

ZUG_plan_tour:0 "Announce the Royal Tour"
ZUG_plan_tour_desc:0 "Amidst the great stir over the upcoming Summer Summit, Mukisa has also declared her intention to tour the land and visit the local chieftains. This way will she not only bring the throne closer to the common zebra but also allow her to convince the chieftains to support her in the future."

ZUG_give_gifts:0 "Give Generous Gifts"
ZUG_give_gifts_desc:0 "As a good liege Mukisa will be sure to give approtiative gifts in return for the hospitaly offered by the clan chieftains."

ZUG_see_warbands:0 "Hear the Warriors' Deeds"
ZUG_see_warbands_desc:0 "As the royal tour continues, Mukisa sees fit to trial the clan warriors. Testing them for their fitness and strength, they shall all meet at the capital to show their power lest they wish to dishonor their families and be forgotten."

ZUG_invite_into_royal_guard:0 "Recruit the Bravest and Strongest"
ZUG_invite_into_royal_guard_desc:0 "The royal Horn Guardians are the traditional household soldiers of the Nnabakyala, meant to protect both the royal family and the Golden Horn. But after Storm King's invasion the guard were left in disgrace due to loss of the ancient artifact. But with some incentives and flattery, Mukisa will see more recruits join its ranks."

ZUG_expand_traditional_rights:0 "Expand Traditional Clan Rights and Lands"
ZUG_expand_traditional_rights_desc:0 "As a show of good faith and benevolence, Mukisa shall expand the traditional rights given to the clans and dole out royal land grants to them. This will be combined with special clan assignments as well. Though, beyond the veil however, most of these rewards will be rather superficial, dealing only in specific local matters, and the lands are mostly backwater territories currently unused."

ZUG_commemorate_liberation:0 "Commemorate Liberation "
ZUG_commemorate_liberation_desc:0 "Ugabi is a free realm and answers to no foreigners will. But, this freedom if we are honest was not won in glory: the original invasion by the Storm King shed the blood of the Mazwi while leaving us safe, so when the Storm King continued his war it was easy to defeat the scant garrisons of the Mazwi. This truth, however, would do little good for the people and a beautiful lie serves a better purpose, does it not?"


ZUG_sudden_visit:0 "At the Barracks"
ZUG_sudden_visit_desc:0 "The Ugabi Central Territorial Army might be united by their belief of superioirity they are, in reality, fractured into multiple power groups, each ruled by a powerful officer. While some are large, others are small. One of these smaller forces, however, happens to be located quite close to the capital and Mukisa has seen fit to pay them a visit."

ZUG_secure_arms:0 "Tactics and Gunpowder"
ZUG_secure_arms_desc:0 "Courage and will alone will not win battles. Modern warfare has no room for the old ways. Something that the accursed UCTA has proven time and again. But a question remains; why let them have the monopoly to this power?"

ZUG_eastern_spies:0 "Pay Attention to the East"
ZUG_eastern_spies_desc:0 "It is important to not ignore the Gulu Clique's military assets either. Rumours speak of hidden arms caches in the swamps that are ready to be wielded by an army of revolutionaries blinded by their own self-righteousness. Even if the truth may be stretched, it would be foolish to not heed them."

ZUG_host_military_officers:0 "Host the Honourable Officers"
ZUG_host_military_officers_desc:0 "A recent announcement has raised quite a few eyebrows across Ugabi. Mukisa has seen fit to hold a banquet at the capital dedicated entirely to honouring the achievements of the UCTA. On the guest list are officers from the military and amongst them is a particular marshall Mukisa is keen to have a talk with."

### Power struggle events

zugstart.1.t:0 "Her Vision"
zugstart.1.d:0 "Event where Mukisa is led to the ceremonial platform by the royal entourage whilst the crowds cheer. There she holds a speech declaring the festivals to be done and, as per tradition, what her vision (essentially what the visiting spirit of the previous Nnabakyala, her father, showed her). In it she saw Ugabi be ravaged by storms and earthquakes, only to give away to a city of gold. She explains that this must mean that Ugabi will face difficult times in the following year but that, in the end, all will be better. After this she plays her role as Nnabakyala and blows the ceremonial horn (replacement one, as the original was taken by the Storm King) which is followed by a spectacular fireworks show, awing the crowds."
zugstart.1.a:0 "Three cheers to our Nnabakyala!"

zugstart.2.t:0 "Tumultuous Spring"
zugstart.2.d:0 "Follow-up event where Mukisa is in her private parlour, reading reports about the military expanding bandit hnting activities to yet another village (read as them just beginning to extort it) and a certain high ranking Gulu clique reformer has escaped house captivity. Mukisa essentially explains to herself and the player the tumultuous political situation Ugabi is in and how either the military or the Gulu clique can move her aside if they gain the power and popularity. To counter this, she has a plan. She will summon the Clans to a summit in the early summer where she will call upon them to reneve their oaths to her and therefore enforce her authority publicly to the nation. However, she will need to cement her position over the spring and make sure neither faction will be powerful enough to oppose her. If Mukisa plays her cards right, then she will be truly in charge of Ugabi."
zugstart.2.a:0 "Let the game begin."

zugstart.3.t:0 "Unfounded Fears"
zugstart.3.d:0 "In the event Mukisa is walking outside the capital on one of her fields where a Maregyptian tractor is being shown to her by a pony engineer. Her royal entourage whisper in the back while further away commoners watch the happening. In her mind Mukisa wonders why there is such a fuzz over such a simple machine but she knows the commoner fears the machines due to the military using them for war. She asks the engineer if anyone can drive such a machine. Given a yes, she tells a guard to fetch the oldest commoner in the crowd. That commoner is then ordered by Mukisa to climb onto the tractor alongside the pony engineer. After a while, the vehicle comes active and begins to drive, operated by the old zebra. This should break fear amongst the common masses, who now look in amazement, especially as the tractor breaks the soil so easily."
zugstart.3.a:0 "A tool is a tool, and nothing more."

zugstart.4.t:0 "An Unusual Strike"
zugstart.4.d:0 "A backfire event for the railroad scheme. Essentially, local workers are refusing to work citing bad work conditions, In reality, some soldiers from the UCTA are holding them back, wanting to be paid. But giving them pay would mean a public humiliation whereas not paying them will stall production, leading to further costs for the royal treasure, even more than the bribe demanded."
zugstart.4.a:0 "§RJust give them the damned gift to make them go.§!"
zugstart.4.b:0 "YRPWe must bide our time for now.§!"

zugstart.5.t:0 "Report Review"
zugstart.5.d:0 "A backfire event where the comission sent to review and plan the drainign process. It has, however, become obvious that there's been serious misscalculations done; it is simply impossible to fulfill the lofty goals with the current budget. This leaves Mukisa with two options; either she downscales her plans but raise ire of the locals, certainly making some go back to the Gulu faction, or increase the comission's budget from her own wealth."
zugstart.5.a:0 "§OPerhaps some plans can be backscaled?§!"
zugstart.5.b:0 "YRDip into the royal treasury to fulfil the plans.§!"

zugstart.6.t:0 "An Evening Story"
zugstart.6.d:0 "In the event a griot finishes telling a tale in a Western Ugabian village. Afterwards, she continues on to tell about Mukisa, her wealth and fierce prowess. How her rule is wise and just. Essentially tells propaganda of her reign, and how the locals should never forget how their Nnabakyala is still their rightful overlord. Should cause some to leave, out of fear for reprisals from the military while others, silently, avert her gaze. She should make a mental note at the end how she needs to leave when everyone's asleep, or risk meeting end of a barrel the coming morning."
zugstart.6.a:0 "Thankless work, even if for a good pay."

zugstart.7.t:0 "Claims Gone Too Far"
zugstart.7.d:0 "A backfire event where the rumours meant to discredit and ruin image of the Gulu reformers has spilled over to Mukisa's own faction; an influential court noble is accused of being a foul cultist due to a past association to a Gulu reformer accused of being one too. By law this should lead to a trial by the temple, so that the accused is either punished or proven innocent. Problem is that Mukisa knows this noble's daughter is also a member in the military and her spies say he plans to escape to the military's camp if a trial is arranged. But if she does not follow up on charge, she will be seen as weak and unjust, favouring her courtiers over the laws."
zugstart.7.a:0 "§YSay nothing on the matter.§!"
zugstart.7.b:0 "§gArrange for a trial.§!"

zugstart.8.t:0 "Clandestine Meeting"
zugstart.8.d:0 "In the event Mukisa has a meeting with two important Gulu reformers who have come to parlay with her. In return for implementing certain reforms and decrees in the future, she will have their support. Mukisa should bark back, calling some of them such as an elected assembly an affront to her God's blessed rule. She counters by admitting that she sees wisdom in some of their wishes, even going as far as calling them true Ugabians for daring to oppose her to see Ugabi rise. But she calls them fools for forgetting to whom the right to rule belongs and how their ideas of collective rule will simply give rise to anarchy. She tells them that she will agree to heed their advice in the future and raise them to be her councillors. The two ultimately agree to her, severly culling Gulu Clique's leadership."
zugstart.8.a:0 "A fruitful discussion."

zugstart.9.t:0 "Love and Lust"
zugstart.9.d:0 "An event where Mukisa's day in the court is overwhelmed by a fierce debate over an incident that had occured in the capital. Two zebras ended up in a drunken argument over some shared love interest, over which they ended up having a fight over that spilled over into a massive group-on-group riot. Issue for Mukisa is, however, that both defendants come from her rivalling factions and while supporting one will lower influence of the loosing faction it will also increase influence of the winner's side. But as the room comes to a silence, Mukisa must make a choice."
zugstart.9.a:0 "§OThe officer caused this entire situation.§!"
zugstart.9.b:0 "§gChieftain's daughter was in the wrong.§!"

zugstart.10.t:0 "Gift Baskets"
zugstart.10.d:0 "An event where a remote village in the backskirts is awoken to a visit by Nnabakyala's dignitaries. They announce that Mukisa is very pleased with the village's dedication to duty and loyalty, citing their bountiful harvests, on-time taxes and merit gained by some zebras originally from the village. The officials then begin to hand out baskets full of food, cloth linen, money, tools and other needed commodities."
zugstart.10.a:0 "Loyalty to one's better will bring due rewards."

zugstart.11.t:0 "Reforged Spirits"
zugstart.11.d:0 "An event where a border village close to UCTA's lands is being harassed and extorted by a platoon of soldiers. This time, however, the villagers are less subdued. Not so meek. This makes the leading officer curious, who happens to spot one elderly granny just chuckling and demands to know what is funny. The old mare replies and says that times are changing. That once again, Ugabi will be ruled by old laws and God's blessing. How the land will thrive after a cleansing fire. This irks the officer, who spats backs and calls her a deranged hag. A villager takes a step forward, only to be violently shoved back with a rifle. The old mare, irregardless, keeps on laughing and even as the soldiers depart on top their car, the laughter seems to trail after them."
zugstart.11.a:0 "What a loony granny."

zugstart.12.t:0 "Divine Right"
zugstart.12.d:0 "An event where a remote village in the backskirts all the villagers have gathered to see and listen to a travelling priest bearing standard of the Nnabakyala. She tells them how the ancestral spirits are restless and angry. For they see Ugabi suffering from disloyalty and greed. Where zebras no longer heed call of the God and the sovereign God has put to rule over the land. These spirits will not rest, until Ugabi will once again stand behind God's chosen, the one who speaks with the spirits. All good subjects must heed this call, for only damnation and ruination will await those who oppose."
zugstart.12.a:0 "So wills God!"

zugstart.13.t:0 "Dreadful Drill"
zugstart.13.d:0 "An event telling about some new recruit's morning training in the UCTA at some fort in western Ugabi. Mood and sprits are particularly low, as despite a limited lockdown by the officers they have all heard the same; Curse Tablets bearing marks cursing all the traitors and enemies of Ugabi. The recruit in question recalls the horror she'd seen in her village, how her former neighbours and even own family acted like she was some accursed being. Their looks haunt her sleep and make her doubt. But a swift lash strike from an officer brings her out from daydreaming and focus back on the drills."
zugstart.13.a:0 "I need a drink."

zugstart.14.t:0 "Royal Splendour"
zugstart.14.d:0 "An event about a royal parade being organised in the capital to the awe of the people. At first not all too out of the ordinary but Mukisa's appearance shatters this; unlike her normal appearance, she is now clad in ceremonial armor, with her face painted in blue like the Ugabian rulers don in their ascension ceremony. She also wield the Pearl Sword, an ancient sword that was gifted to the hero Ekitala by God to beat back the cold demons and united the Ugabian tribes. Mukisa is descendant of this hero."
zugstart.14.a:0 "All hail!"

zugstart.15.t:0 "Seat of Honour"
zugstart.15.d:0 "An event about an evening dinner party in the countryside after the royal tour draws to its conclusion. However, a rather peculiar scene has developed towards the evening between some military officials and elite associated with the Gulu Clique. They are fighting over the honour of sitting besides Mukisa. Whilst Mukisa knows the tour has been a success and will see her position elevate, having either party gain a place of honour in this dinner party will leech some of that success, elevating their side's popularity. But she will have to choose her poison with a smile."
zugstart.15.a:0 "§gHonourable officer.§!"
zugstart.15.b:0 "§OMost gracious chieftain.§!"

zugstart.16.t:0 "The War Cry"
zugstart.16.d:0 "An event where Mukisa, in a place of honour, receives various Ugabian warbands at a field just outside the capital. The warriors recant to her their deeds and brave acts whilst others fight mock battles against one another to gain the honour to approach Mukisa. The royal court gawk and praise Mukisa's name, as she rewards the greatest warriors with gold and silver. However, Mukisa is far more interested in seeing cracks in the smiles of some Gulu allied chieftains, as their warriors in particular are picked out by Mukisa fo gifts and rewards, in a way swaying their loyalty away from their chieftains and to the royal sovereign instead."
zugstart.16.a:0 "True warrior is not only brave but loyal too."

zugstart.17.t:0 "Sullen Oath"
zugstart.17.d:0 "An event where a serious incident threatens the court. For onw of the recent recruits to the new royal guard is, in reality, a deserter from the UCTA and the regiment he is from has issued a formal request to have them be handed over. By the law, the deserter should be handed over to the regiment but this would showcase power of the UCTA while keeping him would break the law and therefore sullen Mukisa's image."
zugstart.17.a:0 "§gLaw is law, give them the deserter.§!"
zugstart.17.b:0 "§YNo.§!"

zugstart.18.t:0 "Serious Charge"
zugstart.18.d:0 "An event where Mukisa find herself sitting upon her seat whilst a delegation of various chieftains are paying their respects to her. But in middle of it all, a group of officers interrupt the affair to level an accusation at one chieftain for crime of betraying Ugabi and harbouring bandits. The chieftain rejects these claims as lies and fabrications. Irregardless of the truth, Mukisa finds herself with two choices; either accept the charge levelled and apprehend the chieftain, which would break Gulu unity but elevate UCTA's position, or reject the charges, showcasing her own authority but also publicly defending a Gulu supporter."
zugstart.18.a:0 "§gApprehend the accused for proper investigation.§!"
zugstart.18.b:0 "§OThis is just hearsay, nothing more.§!"

zugstart.19.t:0 "Claims Gone Too Far"
zugstart.19.d:0 "A backfire event where Mukisa stands in the rain, inspecting the lined soldiers of the UCTA at some barracks whilst an officer stands in a solemn salute. It doesn't escape Mukisa that the officer harbors no love for her, as she is a known closet-socialist, even as far as rumouredly blaspheming the spirits and God. Issue is that now, after a ceremony where many officers were commemorated and gifted with enough gold to be sure of a shifted loyalty, only this one officer remains. But as Mukisa is about to gift this socialist officer, she surprised Mukisa by bowing and requesting a God's blessing instead. This presents an issue to Mukisa however; as a warrior the officer is perfectly in her right to request it however the blessing would mark the warrior as spiritually healthy, something she is not and it is an open-secret. It'd make a fool of Mukisa. But if she were to refuse the offer that would be seen as a slight, playing into the belief within UCTA that Mukisa does not care for them at all and is only interested at the old ways."
zugstart.19.a:0 "§YGold and silver for you.§!"
zugstart.19.b:0 "§gThe spirits shall watch over you.§!"

zugstart.20.t:0 "Gathering the Clues"
zugstart.20.d:0 "An event about an interrigation of a Gulu agent by two royal agents of Mukisa in some hut in eastern Ugabi. The agents want to know more about the arms stashed in the swamps, who smuggled them in and who are his partners. The agent interrogated should refuse and the royal agents are left with no choice but to start emplying harder methods. Likely better these methods are simply implied until the agent begins to crack up."
zugstart.20.a:0 "Dirty but necessary work."

zugstart.21.t:0 "Secret Terror"
zugstart.21.d:0 "Special event if both events 6 and 20 are triggered. Following the recent undercover actions, rumours have grown abound about the royal agents sowing unrest and hunting down traitors of the throne. While these have all been a success so far, there has also been some unrest stirred about this, with some whispers calling Mukisa a tyrant. Mukisa can either continue the operations or dial them back to showcase her magnamous nature."
zugstart.21.a:0 "Disregard the unrest and continue the operations."
zugstart.21.b:0 "There will be mercy — for now."

zugstart.22.t:0 "At the Party"
zugstart.22.d:0 "In the event Mukisa is hosting a grand party for a host of UCTA officer, in particular to those from the faction led by Ekiso. He has the seat of honour, alongside some royal court higher-ups and his closest aides. But the two have some privacy, and they chat about past. How they had met once, at the ceremony before the to-be officers travelled to Saddle Arabia for training, how they returned only to see the blight of the Storm King but also how the Ugabians held out. In the end, Ekiso breaks the ice; he knows the UCTA is in a bad spot while Mukisa's tuhority is growing. He, therefore, offers to pledge his soldiers and allied regiments to her, under one condition. That being UCTA will be reformed, not disbanded. Mukisa should retort by saying Ekiso's faction does contain anti-royalist officers. To this, he does agree and offers to see them be disposed of. At least the ones not toeing the line. With this, Mukisa accepts and rises up to offer a toast to Ekiso before the crowds, cementing their alliance."
zugstart.22.a:0 "To friendship!"

### Summit Chaos event chain

zugchaos.1.t:0 "The Clans Gather"
zugchaos.1.d:0 "The starting event in the event chain for the political chaos; details how the clan chieftains, apart from some, have gathered at the royal palace for the summit. Meanwhile the otherwise bustling capital city has fallen oddly silent, as houses have been fortified, merchant stalls closed and the common people hide, as if expecting something. Tense rumours about the army mobilizing in the west and unlawful mob gatherings in the east have given a rise for alarm. Mukisa expected this and how only God knows what will happen in the following days."
zugchaos.1.a:0 "Time will show the answer."


### Mukisa victory

ZUG_mukisa_victorious:0 "Victory of Tradition"
ZUG_mukisa_victorious_desc:0 "As the dust settles, it's the Nnabakyala Mukisa who stands victorious. Now Ugabi stands ready to heed her orders and bring glory in her name."

ZUG_strike_deserters:0 "Attack the Deserters"
ZUG_strike_deserters_desc:0 "Many took up arms against Mukisa, the true ruler, and many of these traitors fled when the fortune turned against them. These stagglers must be hunted down and put down like the wild beasts they are."

ZUG_capture_forts:0 "Capture the Forts"
ZUG_capture_forts_desc:0 "Many Gulu regiments owned and ran their operations from modern fortifications build with the wealth the military stole from the local populace. Now with UCTA's power destroyed, these forts can prove useful for Mukisa's soldiers to control the west."

ZUG_seize_loot:0 "Seize Their Loot"
ZUG_seize_loot_deac:0 "The officers of the UCTA were no better than common thieves, using their arms and training to terrorize the local population into submission and servitude. After their downfall, however, Mukisa is in position to reverse this; the westernlands will be freed and their ill-gotten wealth seized by royal authorities."

ZUG_wipe_out_remnants:0 "No Quarter for the Traitors"
ZUG_wipe_out_remnants_desc:0 "While they may wish to hide and pray God for mercy, the former bandit-soldiers of the UCTA shall meet due punishment. All of them will be hunted down by not simply our soldiers but also the local population who are eager to punish their oppressors."

ZUG_only_grunts:0 "Spare the Skilled and Meek"
ZUG_only_grunts_desc:0 "While many soldiers of the UCTA were naught but bandits, in reality many joined through forced enlistment or out of desperation. It'd be waste to punish these, who have only followed orders. They shall be given a choice; to earn their full pardon through service to Ugabi and the Nnabakyala."

ZUG_include_some_officers:0 "Few Honourable Officers"
ZUG_include_some_officers_desc:0 "Crooks they may be but the officers of the UCTA are also highly trained military officers. it'd be a waste to simply remove them all. The few who show most willingness to serve and have committed light crimes will be granted amnesty if they will pledge fielty to Mukisa. This time, for the final time."

ZUG_secure_gulu_arms:0 "Secure Remaining Arms Stashes"
ZUG_secure_gulu_arms_desc:0 "While most arms stashes belonging to Gulu insurgents have been secured many more still remain unaccounted for. Royal agents and soldiers will be sent to search the eastern swamps, putting down any remaining insurgents and putting the weapons into far better use."

ZUG_surrender_or_die:0 "Issue Final Warning"
ZUG_surrender_or_die_desc:0 "Even with the arms secured, some fierce Gulu zealots linger in the eastern marshes. it is also evident they are being helped by the local villages despite routine patrols and punishments. Mukisa's patience has run out; she has penned a decree that calls for any remaining insurgents to put down their arms and surrender or face her wrath."

ZUG_imprison_remnants:0 "Imprison the Remnants"
ZUG_imprison_remnants_desc:0 "While the demonstrations may have been quelled and arms stashes secured, many Gulu Clique supporters and provocateurs are laying low, hoping to hide out the storm. Mukisa has no intention to let this pass. All those who opposed her reign must see just, due punishment before throne and God."

ZUG_chained_reform:0 "Harsh Yet Fair Justice"
ZUG_chained_reform_desc:0 "While it is true all those who have committed crimes against the throne must be punished, in reality it's not so simple. Many who supported Gulu are well-respected chieftains, well-educated experts and experienced merchants. Zebras whom Ugabi needs. Mukisa will punish the most egregious cases but also pardon those whom wish to serve Ugabi under its true ruler."

ZUG_break_clique:0 "Break the Clique"
ZUG_break_clique_desc:0 "The entity known as Gulu Clique exists no more. Its leaders are imprisoned, its fiercest supported lay dead in the fields and those who'd wrongly believed in their cause now once again serve the Nnabakyala, whose name is Mukisa."

ZUG_ugabi_god_nnabakyala:0 "God, Ugabi and Nnabakyala"
ZUG_ugabi_god_nnabakyala_desc:0 "The hardships are now past us. Ugabi Central Territorial Army and the Gulu Clique have been subdued and Mukisa can finally enact her plans to change Ugabi into a true nation loyal to the Nnabakyala of Kamarela."

ZUG_to_modernize_ugabi:0 "March of Time and Progress"
ZUG_to_modernize_ugabi_desc:0 "While Ugabi is and will be land of traditions, march of time is inevitable. New innovations and industrialisation have allowed other realms to prosper. In order for Ugabi to stand glorious, it too must look up to the future."

ZUG_gulu_expertises:0 "Meet the Gulu Experts"
ZUG_gulu_expertises_desc:0 "As per her agreement with the Gulu dissenters, Mukisa now stands ready to listen to what their plans for reforming Gulu's economy are. Though not an expert and bit suspicious, the plan for exhaustive reformation of Ugabi through a central industrialisation program does sound promising in her ears."

ZUG_urban_planning:0 "Investigate and Restructure Cities"
ZUG_urban_planning_desc:0 "Sad reality is that all Ugabian cities were born and have grown naturally over the centuries. This has led to overcrowded and tightly packed cities where filth festers and diseases run rampart. It is not only ineffective for the economy but also barbarous. Time to has come to remedy this."

ZUG_urban_growth:0 "Foster Urban Growth"
ZUG_urban_growth_desc:0 "As Ugabian cities continue to develope and improve, an interesting issue has come up; whereas previously the cities were overcrowded without much work to go around, now there are empty houses and lack of adequate labour force needed for the planned factories. A program will be launched to coerce and re-settle zebras from the distant fields into the cities for good paying work."

ZUG_import_industrial_machines:0 "Contact Patriotic Merchants"
ZUG_import_industrial_machines_desc:0 "By using connections to Ugabian merchants and traders both home and abroad the reformers can ensure that only good industrial machinery will be imported into Ugabi at a good price."

ZUG_royal_corporations:0 "Royal Corporations"
ZUG_royal_corporations_desc:0 "While the reformers profess admiration for private entrepreneurialism and capital economy, Mukisa still holds some doubts. To ensure predominance of the Nnabakyala, certain industrial sectors will be reserved and run under various chartered companies owned by the throne."

ZUG_royal_labour:0 "Labour for the Nnbakyala"
ZUG_royal_labour_desc:0 "Work is simply not done for one's sake. All labour in Ugabi is done in the service of thr throne and the one who sits upon it. Every crop grown, every product produce, it all contributes to a common good and is the highest form of patriotism."

ZUG_fund_private_development:0 "Support and Fund Private Businesses"
ZUG_fund_private_development_desc:0 "While a thriving merchant class has always existed in Ugabi, the modern idea of private businesses that cater to the workers does not. In order to build up an industrial economy, there must also exist a properous middle-class of entrepreneurials so not only the affluent but also workers can spend their money."

ZUG_revise_tax_code:0 "Revise the Tax Code"
ZUG_revise_tax_code_desc:0 "With the growth of industrial labour and urban businesses it is time to revise the ancient tax codes. The old feudal tax conducted by the tribes and conflicting rules in the cities are in dire need of revising and streamlining. A group of modern educated financier will be tasked to sort out this mess."

ZUG_connected_cities:0 "Bloodveins of Industry"
ZUG_connected_cities_desc:0 "Industry requires continued movement of goods and produces. Simple dirt roads and old stone paveways simply won't do. The current railroad must be expanded to cover rest of Ugabi to stimulate further economic growth"

ZUG_new_mines:0 "Feeding the Industries"
ZUG_new_mines_desc:0 "Day by day, as more factories are built and railroads track laid, the need for a supply of iron and coal increases. The old mines from the old imperial times are simply not enough; though small, modern mining equipment and expertise will aid, for now, in keeping up the demand."

ZUG_beating_hearts:0 "Life Within the Cities"
ZUG_beating_hearts_desc:0 "TODO"

ZUG_repair_railroad_tracks:0 "Repair Broken Infrastructure"
ZUG_repair_railroad_tracks_desc:0 "During the reign of the previous Nnabakyala, a zebra with great interest in machines and vehicles, a grand railroad was build between Kamarela and the western Ruguzu province. Sadly, it was razed and destroyed during Storm King's invasion. It is time to finally revive the railroad and see to its expansion."

ZUG_agricultural_economy:0 "Ugabi's Golden Fields"
ZUG_agricultural_economy_desc:0 "Ugabi's wealth has always grown from its soil. It'd be foolish to disregard the farm fields and estates entirely. New machines and technologies will improve yields, and the wealth gained will enable industrialisation of the land in the cities."

### Mukisa events 

zugmukisa.1.t:0 "Mukisa's Triumph"
zugmukisa.1.d:0 "Event about Mukisa's victory in the aftermath of Gulu protests disbanded and military subdued. Now she steps inside the summti hall, to speak to the clan chieftains gathered there. She makes a grand speech, where she says that the chaos showcases fractures, disloyalty and spiritual imbalance in the realm. The tribes must therefore now once again unite together and pledge their eternal loyalty to the Nnbakalyalas. One by one, all the chieftains rise up and pledge their tribes to her, much to Mukisa's satisfaction."
zugmukisa.1.a:0 "Now the true work can begin."

zugmukisa.2.t:0 "The Hour Strikes"
zugmukisa.2.d:0 "Event set in some marshy location where some Gulu hideout is preparing for an assault by Mukisa's forces. A herald is yelling to them to surrender, to spare their lives. Essentially tells them to go fuck themselves before the attack comes, ending in the death of the Gulu resistance fighter from whose PoV the event is happening."
zugmukisa.2.a:0 "Defiant even in defeat."

zugmukisa.3.t:0 "Unquestionable Sovereign"
zugmukisa.3.d:0 "Event where Mukisa is signing some documents and decrees whilst on the sides the royal court awaits in stand by, ready to act on every whim. At some point she signals for the bureaucrat to accept her signed papers, who does so crawling and bowing, before announcing she will hold the court, rising up. All the court then bows as she leaves for the throne room before trailing after her, trying to get themselves as close to Mukisa as possible. Mukisa should very much find this entire ordeal pleasing in her ears."
zugmukisa.3.a:0 "Only I rule in Ugabi."

zugmukisa.4.t:0 "The Palace Conclave"
zugmukisa.4.d:0 "Event from POV of the priest family's head whose a priest himself. He alongside others have been summoned to the palace by the Nnabakyala for a grand sermon. Nothing unusual, these would have happened before. But as the Nnabakyala enters into the room, dressed in her attire, the air would feel different. As she steps to the central altar, she'd share a vision to them all. How she was on a plain beset by harsh winds and the skies were covered by clouds that blocked the sun, crashing at one another and leaving only small openings. But then the winds ceased, and the clouds began to merge. Until there was but one large, that then parted for the Sun to shine to the land once again. Mukisa then proceeds to tell she sees this as direct message from God for change. To unite the faitful under one temple, to not let them clash against one another. This is why she has had the priests from the individual temples summoned, so they could, at this royal conclave before God's intermediary, seek to forge bonds. The POV should perhaps feel bit query over this but another priest elsewhere in the hall yells out her support, citing loyalty to Nnabakyala. Another one follows suite, citing how God commands this. Soon, even the POV cannot help but to join in pledging their support."
zugmukisa.4.a:0 "It is God's will!"

zugmukisa.5.t:0 "Fidelity and Faith"
zugmukisa.5.d:0 "Event from POV of the farming family, that is arosen to a righteous anger (there should be no doubt for the POV, they should feel absolutely adamant they are doing what is right for God and their sovereign). Turns out, that their local temple has chosen not to abide to the central temple doctrine and therefore has not only betrayed Nnabakyala but God too. The farmers, aided by royal heralds and agents, have put the temple under siege and stand ready to storm it, armed with their farming tools and odd rifle. Inside, the sound of rituals can be heard before the heavy iron gates are torn open with the aid of explosives."
zugmukisa.5.a:0 "For pious Ugabi!"

zugmukisa.6.t:0 "Dutiful Teaching"
zugmukisa.6.d:0 "Event from POV of the farming family's youngest children, who is listening to the new teacher from the capital teaching the letters and words upon a chalkboard outside. In the distance, some of the older zebras too listen in admist their work. The teacher recounts the legend of the Golden Horn, how the legendary hero was gifted it by God and the hero used it to vanquish the cold spirits from the land. He then proceeds to gift them all with a book that has both the story and a section for the alphabets. The kids eagerly open and awe at the colourful pages. The teacher, however, quickly gathers them all back and tells that they must take care of these books, as they are gift from the most gracious Nnabakyala to their loyal subjects. From this he tells them to open the first page, on which is actually a drawn image of Mukisa and some text that the teacher tells them to repeat after him."
zugmukisa.6.a:0 "M for Mukisa, our lawful sovereign and herald of God..."

zugmukisa.7.t:0 "Family Gathering"
zugmukisa.7.d:0 "Event from POV of Mukisa as she sits upon the throne, joined only by her family and children. No one else is present except for few close servants, scribes and royal guards. After a while, Mukisa declares that it is her intention to decree a law of succession. This stuns everyone, but she continues on that succession has far too often led to chaos in Ugabi, as family turns against each other. She reminds them all she herself is growing old, too. For this sake, in model with the monarchies in the world, she will implement primogeniture; eldest child will inherit all. Silence falls, as eyes turn to Amanyi. But soon, cries of outrage emerge as some of his siblings decry how their rights and priviliges are being trampled over. But Mukisa will have none of this, declaring that her decree is final and that she will not tolerate any further outbursts, managing to calm things. Her attention then turns to Amanyi, whom she beckons to come forth. He does and bends before her throne. Mukisa then rises up and declare him her successor as Prince of Ugabi, with the authority bestowed by God. The royal guards raise their weapons and acknowledge this. But rest of the family remain quiet and anger clear upon their faces."
zugmukisa.7.a:0 "The succession is secured."

zugmukisa.8.t:0 "Realm Reneved"
zugmukisa.8.d:0 "Event from POV of Amanyi, now styled as Prince of Ugabi (which should chafe him a bit) is standing at a balcony in the royal palace with his mother, Mukisa, as they greet celebrating commoners on this holiday for Ugabi's recent successes and stability under Mukisa's personal rule. Just behind them, in the shadows, military officers and court nobles stand by like statues, awaiting any possible command. All this personal rule feels like a heavy burden to Amanyi but as far as he can see, her mother seems to actually revel in her authority and power. His thoughts are cut short by a comment from Mukisa about how Ugabi now stands ready. He questions what she means and she in turn points to the far horizons, how Ugabi must now do its part to unite the zebras of the Great Lakes, to bring peace to the remnants of the broken empire. The land needs one ruler to do it. Amanyi says nothing but Mukisa turns around, grabbing him along and marching inside, officers and nobles bowing. Her last remark is how him and her must see the gold- and witchsmiths for a special project."
zugmukisa.8.a:0 "The time has come."

zugmukisa.9.t:0 "The Opening Day"
zugmukisa.9.d:0 "Event from POV of an artisan family in the capital Kamarela preparing for the opening of their new store, stylized to the photos and images from Saddle Arabian and Maregyptian shops. Theirs is not the only store, as today countless other modern stores and shops open across the city, with a holiday so everyone is free to visit the stores. It has been in part funded by a stipend from the government, and just above the new cash register hungs a photograph of Mukisa, surrounded by decorative flowers and an insence lamp slowly burning. Entire family stands ready to work together, and the mother then flips the sign on the front door, and immediatelly the first customer enters in."
zugmukisa.9.a:0 "Welcome, how may we serve you?"

zugmukisa.10.t:0 "Way of the Wrench"
zugmukisa.10.d:0 "Event from POV of the farming family bidding goodbye to their second eldest daughter. She and others from the village are going away to learn about the tractors, so she can return in half year to teach them in turn. Others in the village are also bidding their farewells to their children, before they all embark upon the trucks to travel to Gulu, where the institute is located. The family wonders if she will be alright. Youngest maybe remarks how she'll come back as a fancy zebra. To that they all chuckle."
zugmukisa.10.a:0 "An engineer from our family? That'd be something."

zugmukisa.11.t:0 "What to do with Baminazpus?"
zugmukisa.11.d:0 "Event for player to decide what to do with the warrior queen. Either the player can release her under an oath to never raise arms against the throne or gifting her an estate far away from public sight, under strict supervision of the Golden Griots."
zugmukisa.11.a:0 "Release her for an oath."
zugmukisa.11.b:0 "She is too dangerous to be released..."

zugmukisa.12.t:0 "Performance Practises"
zugmukisa.12.d:0 "Event set in the POV of a Golden Griot agent, preparing his instrument alongside some normal orchestral members set to provide enterntainment across the city. He playes friendly, chatting with the fellow band members but makes attention of their playful comments upon Mukisa, including one member making a snideful remark upon the monarch, since she comes from the north. He is sure to earmark her as a potential trouble maker to be apprehended after the coronation is over."
zugmukisa.12.a:0 "The show must go on."

zugmukisa.13.t:0 "Out In the Rain"
zugmukisa.13.d:0 "Event set in the POV of a young child sitting outside a prison with her grandfather amongst other zebras. The prison, somewhere in northern Great Lakes, housed a lot of army officers that were captured after Ugabi conquest, interred to make sure no rebellion would follow. The child shoudl be able to remember mother very well. At last, the prison gates open and from within the prisoners emerge; slightly haggard and underfed but in good spirits. Many happy reunions follow, until the child's mother too emerges. Maybe end in the two hugging?"
zugmukisa.13.a:0 "A long awaited reunion."

zugmukisa.14.t:0 "Her Illustrious Imperial Majesty"
zugmukisa.14.d:0 "Event about Mukisa standing in her royal quarters, being worked on by a regiment of tailors preparing her coronation outfit. Amanyi is by her side, being himself prepared for his own princely outfit. He should be in a bit dour mood, telling straight at Mukisa she disapproves her title. She should dismiss him, saying her achievement is worthy equal to the old Mansas or even the great Kaisers of Griffonia far away. Only an imperial title is worthy to bear. He should counter, saying that such a title would only cause ire in the nearby realms by claiming such a high title. She should allude that such trivialities ought to not matter, how they should not be foolish enough to raise an ire against the power of Unified Great Lakes. This time he bides his tongue but internally just thinks about the reports from military commanders of fierce resistance and noncooperation from the locals. Not to mention some unrest even back home. Maybe end the scene with Mukisa clapping her hooves, dissmissing the tailors and ordering a dinner to be prepared for them."
zugmukisa.14.a:0 "Worries darken the prince's mind."

zugmukisa.15.t:0 "Her Legacy"
zugmukisa.15.d:0 "Event from POV of Mukisa, whom is feeling very tired. She is going over reports at her desk, alongside the plans for the grand coronation. It is late in the evening, so she quits everything for the day and walks away alone to the royal palace's temple. Her thoughts are muddled, her ears have picked up the murmurs from courtiers about her son and zebras flocking covertly to him. It should worry her, there have been cases of old Nnabakyalas being found dead in their bedchamber due to ambitions of their children. She makes her way to the grand temple and to its altar. There, amongst statues dedicated to her ancestors, stands one of her own father. Before its shadow she lets her thoughts get away; Amanyi would not betray her like that. She knows him to be an ableminded zebra, one that has the willpower to carry on the dynasty in her wake. She turns to pray, and this comforts her heart further."
zugmukisa.15.a:0 "Spirits, messengers of Lord, hear my prayer."

zugmukisa.16.t:0 "On the Patrol"
zugmukisa.16.d:0 "Event from POV of a soldier patrolling in Timbucktu's streets. While life in city has slowly began to revitalize, scars of the unification wars are still present and beggars fill the city streets. On the ruined houses, there read slowgans about coming of the end, pleading begs for God to aid and anti-Ugabian propaganda. The entire platoon is bit nerved, knowing there are still zebras whom resist them. Maybe include a small skirmish in the scene?"
zugmukisa.16.a:0 "Patrolling the North almost makes you wish for a new war."

zugmukisa.17.t:0 "At the Desk"
zugmukisa.17.d:0 "Event from POV of a low-level bureaucrat in some northern city attempting to guide some local resident through paperwork for an identification. Problem is they don't speak the same language, only leading to confusion and frustration until the local just rips the papers before walking away."
zugmukisa.17.a:0 "What a mess."

zugmukisa.18.t:0 "Her New Role"
zugmukisa.18.d:0 "Event from POV of Mukisa's daughter, now the new royal governor of Mazwi. Very bitterminded slob who feels like her future has now been robbed from her due to her idiotic mother and scheming bastard half-brother Amanyi. She arrived to the city and has taken residence in the old residence of Mansas, alongside a cadre of troops and servants from Ugabi. But for most part, due to shortage of skilled servants, the old bureaucrats and royal advisors still linger in the palace to keep the region operating. And now some of those have began to approach her about gatherings and meetings. Plots for an insurgency against Ugabi, which will need an unifying icon to walk behind with."
zugmukisa.18.a:0 "They will pay."

zugmukisa.19.t:0 "God's Blessed Ruler"
zugmukisa.19.d:0 "Event from POV of Mukisa sitting at her throne, trying to focus upon a speech being delivered by a tribal chieftain relaying his and his entire tribe's congratulations upon her upcoming acccension. Entire world seems to heave around her a bit and her headache is killing her. Until she wonders why she is laying down, and that will be her last though; the Nnabakyala Mukisa has collapsed to the shock of the court."
zugmukisa.19.a:0 "Summon a doctor!"

zugmukisa.20.t:0 "Death of Mukisa"
zugmukisa.20.d:0 "General perspective event that tells how Mukisa's death announcement has shocked the realm. But only a day after, things begin to move; in the capital, a murmur begins to ripple amongst the people over the hardships caused by Mukisa's war, and in the distant regions formerly hidden resistances have emerged openly to defy the local garrisons, with many rural areas completely revolting, pushing out royal officials. In few places, the royal governors, siblings of Amanyi, have either escaped overseas with as much as wealth as possible or alligned themselves to the local resistance movements, especially in Mazwi and Timbucktu. In Kamarela, the royal palace is in general chaos, with Amanyi deep in shock,not relaying any orders. The troops prepared for the coronation parade stand guard around the royal palace."
zugmukisa.20.a:0 "Times of turmoil."

zugmukisa.21.t:0 "Glory Incarnate"
zugmukisa.21.d:0 "Just a placeholder event to fool you, the player, to think Mukisa will get coronated. If you got this even in a non-console game, please relay the bug to devs. If you used consoles, then turn back and do this focus properly."
zugmukisa.21.a:0 "Awkward..."

### Amanyi events

zugamanyi.1.t:0 "The Prodigal Son"
zugamanyi.1.d:0 "An event from the POV of Amanyi, eldest son of Mukisa, who is returning upon boat from Re´em where he has studied for few years. He should feel weird about everything, about how the message had come not by a messenger but by a cadre of nobles and servants whom had also accompanied him, treating him like the royalty he was. Something he had grown unaccustomed whilst living in Re´em. As the boat approaches shores of Kamarela, guns fire in the distance. He can see that the port is crowded with people, all celebrating, whilst by the pier awaits his mother alongside royal entourage and the court. When the boat docks and he descends the steps, he is immediatelly pulled into a hug by Mukisa whilst the nobles bow before them."
zugamanyi.1.a:0 "Most warm welcome."

zugamanyi.2.t:0 "Prince of Ugabi"
zugamanyi.2.d:0 "An event from the POV of Amanyi walking in the royal palace, trailed on by a cadre of personal servants and Throne Guardians as befit of his station. In reality he'd rather wish to be alone but he knew that is out of the question; as a prince, he had a status to uphold. He decides to head to the garden, to enjoy some fresh air. There, as he emerges into the garden, a young colt should accidentally stumble into him, sending both of them flying. Amanyi is immediately rushed back up whilst the guards move in to apprehend the colt, with only quick objection by Amanyi ceasing it. But when he attempts to lift up the colt, the young foal just stays frozen, bowing. At that moment the colt's father, one of the gardeners, rushes in, bowing and scraping the floor while constantly apologising for his son's error, promising to punish him. Amanyi tries to calm the stallion down but he quickly realizes it is no use. He maybe ends up walking away, not knowing just who he even is anymore."
zugamanyi.2.a:0 "TODO"

zugamanyi.3.t:0 "Absolutism"
zugamanyi.3.d:0 "An event from the POV of Amanyi enjoying a respite, reading some books, in a shaded alcove overlooking the royal throneroom. One reserved solely for the royal family members, so he gets to have some solo time for a change. Below, his mother is holding court, relaying some type of judgement. His ears, however, pick up something; the current case has no clear defined line in the law codes, as presented by a scholar. So, on the spot, Mukisa declares her judgement and orders this to be accounted for in the law for the future. This makes Amanyi think; when he was in Re´em, he had read about other countries in the world, where you had no absolute ruler. Or even if the ruler had power, they still had to account for nobles or even elected commoners representing the people. But here, the monarch ruled absolute. A role he would one day need to fill in. In part, it makes him fearful. But another part in him also begins to think just the ways he would change things in Ugabi."
zugamanyi.3.a:0 "Maybe absolutism has its benefits?"

zugamanyi.4.t:0 "Course of Action"
zugamanyi.4.d:0 "An event from the POV of Amanyi in state of distress, anxiety and just ton of stress. He is beign addressed by royal advisors and army officers, each offering him advice on what to do about the current unrest wrecking not just the newly conquered lands but also the capital itself. The army officers are requesting permission to deal with the crisis, so as to save the realm. But the royal advisors fear the army will be too extreme; sure, there will be deaths, but these deaths should be limited to just those whom are behind the chaos. These two sides should bicker a bit, until underslept Amanyi snaps out, silencing them before making his decision."
zugamanyi.4.a:0 "The chaos has gone too far. It has to stop, now."
zugamanyi.4.b:0 "Anger will lead to nothing, we must be careful."

zugamanyi.5.t:0 "Abandoned Streets"
zugamanyi.5.d:0 "An event from the POV of some tank driver, as they are rolling down theroads in the capital, with soldiers marching ahead. In the distance, a broadcaster spreads the foreboding warning that until the disturbances have ceased, the military shall be patrolling the city. The tanker watches as ahead the soldiers clear the road from the dead to give them way. Even if the tank soldier is a veteran of the unification wars, even he is bit taken back by the sheer brutality. But he does admit it has worked, given it is so silent."
zugamanyi.5.a:0 "The capital is calm once again."

zugamanyi.6.t:0 "The Weeping Fields"
zugamanyi.6.d:0 "An event about some mass execution in some field conducted by royalist paramilitaries. Let's not get too drimderpy with these, what is happening here is absolutely inhumane and wrong. I trust you to be able to make justice for this."
zugamanyi.6.a:0 "Justice served."

zugamanyi.7.t:0 "By Her Side"
zugamanyi.7.d:0 "An event from POV of a devastaed Amanyi, whom is by the side of Mukisa's dead body, as it is layed in the temple of God within the royal palace. Her body has been prepared for sky burial; to be burnt at the highest tower in the palace. But even if he is in grief, now comes the last part of the ritual; he unbelts the Pearl Sword from her mother's waist and ties it to himself. Though he also does give a kiss to the cold mask, as one final goodbye, before slowly marching to the closed bronze doors. Once there, he pushes them open to a royal court, priests and Throne Guardians whom bow to him. The priests could maybe say something about God taking away a Nnabakyala but also giving them a new one?"
zugamanyi.7.a:0 "TODO"

zugamanyi.8.t:0 "Bride of God"
zugamanyi.8.d:0 "An event from POV of Amanyi, as he is admist a cermon of marriage to God. The temple shimmers from lamp light, is cast in cloud of burning insences and deafened by music from instruments. Before the main altar, he lifts up the golden goblet and drinks the wine within. Similar cup, set by the altar for God, remains still. A servant takes the cup from Amanyi's hoof as he turns around to address the watching royal court and priests. To them, he speaks the vows of Nnabakyala, a prayer through which he commits himself to God by an unbreakable vow. But though he speaks the words, he should feel like an imposter; though he believed in God, he had never been a devout worshipper. He knows the words for prayer but feels nothing in his heart as he speaks them."
zugamanyi.8.a:0 "God, do you hear me?"

zugamanyi.9.t:0 "At the Front"
zugamanyi.9.d:0 "An event from POV of a veteran soldier standing in a tight-formation line against a mass of rioting zebras in the capital. The soldier should be an absolute loyalist to the throne, itching for a fight. Behind, on top some old truck, an officer is yelling that by grace of spirits and in the name of the Prince the crowd must disperse. A whistle from another one rings out, signalling for the soldiers to affix their bayonets. This sight causes some rioters to calm a bit, dropping their rocks and makeshift batons. The soldier makes note of them. But majority of the crowd is still antsy. The officer gives one final warning and another whistle rings, with the soldiers now pointing the rifles at the crowd. Then, a third whistle rings out and the soldiers charge forward."
zugamanyi.9.a:0 "Apprehend them!"

zugamanyi.10.t:0 "Betwee Razor Wire."
zugamanyi.10.d:0 "An event set in an internment camp where various political prisoners, local officials and other suspected of treason have been gathered for investigation.

zugamanyi.10.a:0 "TODO"

zugamanyi.11.t:0 "Royal Spectacle"
zugamanyi.11.d:0 "An event about the coronation and enthronement of Amanyi as the King of the Great Lakes. Marks the end of direct chaos following Mukisa's death and dawn of a new era though many hardships still face the new kingdom."

zugamanyi.12.t:0 "Humble Petition"

zugamanyi.12.a:0 "TODO"

zugamanyi.13.t:0 "Peculiar Outcome"
zugamanyi.13.d:0 "A flavour event if Amanyi has resolved to free the usual system in general; a system has now developed where poor zebras will await at the palace gates to petition the throne only to sell up their place in the queu to richer zebras coming in."
zugamanyi.13.a:0 "TODO"

zugamanyi.14.t:0 "Time Honoured Tradition"
zugamanyi.14.d:0 "A flavour event if Amanyi will maintain the old ways; some outsider noble arrives to petition the king and is instructed upon a firm royal protocol which, to her miff, would include tearing one's own clothing to be in tatters alongside dirtying it with dirt."
zugamanyi.14.a:0 "TODO"

zugamanyi.15.t:0 "The Old Ways"
zugamanyi.15.d:0 "An event in which Amanyi is receiving some tribal chieftains from across the kingdom in a jovial little party. During it, however, a block of chieftains representing a very traditionalist faction comes to the king pleading he does not go forward with his plan for an extensive field reductions to the state. Amanyi knows these fields are as of now just useless wasteland in no use so he asks why they would not wish to see these fields come to life with industries that will provide wealth to their communities. The chieftains just wish to be left alone, to live as things were in the past prior to the wars. They are just tired of the modern world. In the end, Amanyi must make a choice."
zugamanyi.15.a:0 "Leave the land to them."
zugamanyi.15.b:0 "Benefit of the kingdom comes first."

zugamanyi.16.t:0 "Voice of the Masses"
zugamanyi.16.d:0 "An event in which Amanyi is being pulled by two sides again. On one side, some reformers wish to see set of representatives of commoners created so that the commoners will feel like they have some represenation even if these represenatives would be chosen by the crown. Meanwhile other royal advisors decry this as a slippery slope towards further commoner rights, saying commoners need nothing more than stability and to not have them be bothered by politics. Choice, in the end, falls to Amanyi, who does himself hold commoners need to be heard though he is also wary for kingdom's stability."

Amanyi does fit camp in both sides really; he considers himself an educated ruler who wishes to listen to his subjects (aka Equestrian way) but he is also heir to a long legacy of Nnabakyalas, with his kingdom having been forged by a war of unification like to those of the Grovers."

### Starting ideas

ZUG_territorial_army:0 "Ugabi Central Territorial Army"
ZUG_territorial_army_desc:0 "The UCTA was created in 990 to liberate Ugabi from Mazwi vassalage by Nnabakyala Mukisa. Zebras were sent to Saddle Arabian military academies while foreign arms were purchased for the modern regiments. Yet, it was all for naught as the Storm King razed Mazwi, shattering the large realm and freeing Ugabi. This left the new army without a purpose yet a powerful position in the free nation, enough to rival the monarchy itself. Over the years, UCTA has only grown in influence, directly taking control of economy in key areas and only paying lipservice to the ruler."

ZUG_gulu_tablet:0 "The Gulu Tablet Convention"
ZUG_gulu_tablet_desc:0 "In 1001, Nnabakyala Mukisa signed the Gulu Tablet that ended slavery in Ugabi lands to secure support of an abolitionist coalition to counter the army's growing influence. Over the years, however, the original abolitionist coalition has grown into a broad alliance for further reforms. More alarmingly, many of its leaders are also chieftains of influential eastern tribes and this has given the movement legitimacy even amongst the traditional elite."

ZUG_golden_fields:0 "Golden Fields"

### Events ###
austurland.1.t:0 "On The Matters Of Family"
austurland.1.d:0 "... the story of Jarl Ygritte is one of mystery and courage,  that is unlike any other to grace the minds of deers across the land. The Jarl's birth was always brought up across the time of her reign, and much of it would determine how she ruled in the end.\n\nThough of course, much is a myth by this point, but they say that..."
austurland.1.a:0 "...she was born to a lowly family of §RThralls§!"
austurland.1.b:0 "...she was the daughter of a fierce §YBandit§! lord"
austurland.1.c:0 "...she was born to a family of well-off §MMerchants§!"
austurland.1.e:0 "...she was born the heir to one of the most prestigious §GNoble§! houses of Austurland"

austurland.2.t:0 "A Peculiar Child"
austurland.2.d:0 "As a child of a thrall, no one expected Ygritte to do much of anything with her life. She had simple beginnings in the countryside with her family, and while many children would indulge in the few luxuries their age afforded them. A few things were different about Ygritte that could be noticed by those who met her. The quirk other deers saw first was that..."
austurland.2.a:0 "...she spent her time caring for the other Thralls"
austurland.2.b:0 "...she spent her time sneaking about and stealing what she could"
austurland.2.c:0 "...she spent her time working the fields"

austurland.3.t:0 "Time Marches On"
austurland.3.d:0 "But as always, the flower of youth is lost to the withers of older age. And after Ygritte... peculiar childhood many started to see the light behind her eyes and begin to dream she may go on to do something bigger then what she was born into. And as she grew she proved them correct. As the years went by, she fit nicely into the role of..."
austurland.3.a:0 "...a ruthless criminal"
austurland.3.b:0 "...an honest trader"
austurland.3.c:0 "...a Berserker"

austurland.4.t:0 "The Takeover"
austurland.4.d:0 "But as she grew a burning began to gather in her soul, there was something else she had to do with herself. And she saw that future amongst all of her fellow thralls in the fields of the noble lords. Subjected to the worst pains of their lives. She knew she must rise one way or another. And so she chose to do as such! Gathering an ever growing following of the poor and needy of Austurland, she eventually marched on the capital! And in an act that all deer of the east remember, threw the former Jarl out of the window of the highest tower in the city. And proclaimed herself the Jarl!\n\nIsn't that such a great story? It's one we should take care to remember that the commondeer will not tolerate everything forever..."
austurland.4.a:0 "Thanks for the story..."

austurland.5.t:0 "A Peculiar Child"
austurland.5.d:0 "Ah yes, everyone knows the tale of the Jarl, daughter of bandits! And as the story goes, she had a childhood not like most other deer. Her father was apathetic and cared little for his family. Though as her childhood progressed, he began to see something in her and opened up her life a bit more. Her mother always tried to keep her away from banditry but in the end, the fate of her childhood was to..."
austurland.5.a:0 "...spend her time reading and studying"

austurland.6.t:0 "Time Marches On"
austurland.6.d:0 "With her childhood around her father cemented, Ygritte would grow up around banditry and crime. But her future was not yet set in stone. As she grew over the many years, she began to mature and change. Her fate would finally be decided when her father passed away, and his mercenary band was left without true leadership. When this occurred she..."
austurland.6.a:0 "She used her knowledge to create a criminal empire"
austurland.6.b:0 "She continued her father's legacy"
austurland.6.c:0 "She reformed her Bandit band into a Mercenary Army"

austurland.7.d:0 "As her mother and she fled, they wished to take refuge in the hall of an old friend of her mother's. While they stayed here, her father perished from mediocre wine. And his second in command took over the mercenary band. This deer was not only twice as ruthless as Ygritte's father had been, but blamed Ygritte's mother for the father's death and signed a death warrant in her name. While this deer began to expand his influence, Austurland became more and more dangerous.  As one could hardly go outside without being ambushed. As Ygritte grew, she knew she must right the wrongs done by her father, and she began to assemble a power base of her own using guile and charisma. When the power struggle came to a head, in the end, Ygritte would..."
austurland.7.a:0 "She fought her father's successor and saved Austurland!"

austurland.8.t:0 "The Takeover"
austurland.8.d:0 "After Ygritte had begun to develop her less than legitimate career, she began to set her sights on higher ambitions within Austurland. Specifically, she thought it a grand idea to rule over the place. Ygritte thought she had the leadership experience to do it, and she definitely had the resources needed. With this, she made her move and..."
austurland.8.a:0 "...used her army to take Austurland over"
austurland.8.b:0 "...used her money to bribe her way into power"
austurland.8.c:0 "...used her criminal connections to plot her way into power"

austurland.9.t:0 "The Ascension"
austurland.9.d:0 "With her rival defeated, and a power base in her hands, Ygritte received a letter from the capital. After the dissolution of her father's old mercenary band, parts of it had gone off to pillage the capital city before anyone could stop them. In the chaos, the royal family was killed, and no deer now sat on the throne.\n\nFilled with confidence from her victory, Ygritte decided she must take it upon herself to protect Austurland as its new Jarl! As she entered the capital, no one opposed her claim. There were no others left to take it, and many considered her a hero for what she had done to vanquish the foul bandit in the countryside. And so, Ygritte became the Jarl born to a bandit, as well as the Jarl who defeated one."
austurland.9.a:0 "Due to her heroic deeds she was proclaimed Jarl"

The Jarl had died without designating an heir, and everyone was clamoring to get their hands on the throne, including Ygritte. And of course, we all know she won out in the end.

### Ideas ###
OLV_warriors_idea_0:0 "§WWarrior Loyalty -§! §RRebellious§!"
OLV_warriors_idea_0_desc:0 "Through various contemptuous actions, the Jarl of Austurland has earned the enmity and ire of her oath-sworn warriors. Many have gone ahead and deserted active service. Without their support, the Jarl can do very little in terms of decisive actions, and may find herself a victim of a mutiny."
OLV_warriors_idea_1:0 "§WWarrior Loyalty -§! §ODisgruntled§!"
OLV_warriors_idea_1_desc:0 "The warriors serve the Jarl without question, but many talk how their loyalty is unappreciated. Some have even deserted, seeking a more worthy liege to serve."
OLV_warriors_idea_2:0 "§WWarrior Loyalty -§! §YAverage§!"
OLV_warriors_idea_2_desc:0 "The proud warriors of Austurland have little good to say about the Jarl, but even less poor things to complain about. For now, their sensibilities are respected, and their service is guaranteed."
OLV_warriors_idea_3:0 "§WWarrior Loyalty -§! §CDependable§!"
OLV_warriors_idea_3_desc:0 "Through her displays of bravery and honour, the Jarl has earned some particularly loyal followers, ready to defend her to the death. Such an opinion is not the majority, but it keeps the Jarl comfortable that she can count on her warriors when she needs them the most."
OLV_warriors_idea_4:0 "§WWarrior Loyalty -§! §GDevoted§!"
OLV_warriors_idea_4_desc:0 "Ardent followers to the last, the Jarl has inspired the warriors of Austurland to such a degree, that they are ready to charge the gates of Tartarus at her command. To have the majority of armed deer following her commands could prove to be very useful for the Jarl, if she wishes to enact change."
OLV_commoners_idea_0:0 "§WCommondeer Discontent -§! §RVery High§!"
OLV_commoners_idea_0_desc:0 "A commondeer's life has never been easy in Austurland, but the actions of the Jarl and the nobles have incensed them recently. The merchants and the peasants talk of a revolution, inspired by those to the distant west, if the Jarl does not comply with their demands for a better life."
OLV_commoners_idea_1:0 "§WCommondeer Discontent -§! §OHigh§!"
OLV_commoners_idea_1_desc:0 "The hardships of the deer have been harsher lately, and this reflects in their contempt for their betters. Peasant revolts are common lately, and their noble masters are frequently pushed to utilise force to ensure compliance. Violence will only be effective for so long, however, before they find it too much to tolerate." 
OLV_commoners_idea_2:0 "§WCommondeer Discontent -§! §YAverage§!"
OLV_commoners_idea_2_desc:0 "The peasants and merchants frequently gripe about their conditions, as they are wont to do, but for the most part, their lives are not overflowing with burden. As it always was."
OLV_commoners_idea_3:0 "§WCommondeer Discontent -§! §CLow§!"
OLV_commoners_idea_3_desc:0 "The Jarl's recent reforms have steadily improved the livelihood of the commondeer. While they remain without rights and influence, they are satisfied with the current progress, and work harder as a result, believing that there is more in the future."
OLV_commoners_idea_4:0 "§WCommondeer Discontent -§! §GNon-Existent§!"
OLV_commoners_idea_4_desc:0 "Much to the dismay of the nobility, the Jarl is seen as a true champion of the freefolk, actively seeing to protect and advance their interests. The wealthy merchants in particular see the Jarl as their opportunity to advance in the social sphere, and everydeer wonders if there is a substantial change to Austurland coming soon." 
OLV_noble_idea_0:0 "§WThe Nobility's Opinion -§! §RVilified§!"
OLV_noble_idea_0_desc:0 "It is common for the elites to scheme and seek their own betterment, but the Jarl's actions have pushed these independent actors to conspire together, wondering if they could place somedeer more suitable on the throne, rather than the current disgrace. It is not uncommon for the nobles to actively disobey the Jarl."
OLV_noble_idea_1:0 "§WThe Nobility's Opinion -§! §OHated§!"
OLV_noble_idea_1_desc:0 "The landed elite has very few positive matters to say about the Jarl. There have certainly been worse rulers in the past, but they often mutter in the shadows, if they should try to actively change their current situation."
OLV_noble_idea_2:0 "§WThe Nobility's Opinion -§! §YDisliked§!"
OLV_noble_idea_2_desc:0 "While the nobles dislike their ruler, they at least respect her enough to recognise the Jarl as the final authority in the land. They do wish that the privileged would be more appreciated and considered in the matters of the state, however."
OLV_noble_idea_3:0 "§WThe Nobility's Opinion -§! §CAmiable§!"
OLV_noble_idea_3_desc:0 "The privileged of Austurland are content with their Jarl. She has respected their titles, expanded their prerogatives, and most importantly, kept the upstart commondeer down where they belong."
OLV_noble_idea_4:0 "§WThe Nobility's Opinion -§! §GBeloved§!"
OLV_noble_idea_4_desc:0 "Few among the peers can remember the time when their liege lord was this considerate and accomodating to their wishes and desires. Indeed, the Jarl and her court are working in splendid harmony for the betterment of Austurland, even if many outside of this privileged social circle can't say that their own positions have improved lately."

OLV_noble_resistance_1:0 "Foringjar Rebels"
OLV_noble_resistance_1_desc:0 "The conflict between the nobility and the government has reached a boiling point, and many nobles have openly declared themselves to be in revolt. These traitors are organized into a group called the foringjar, which seeks to enforce noble dominance upon the entire country. A significant amount of their Huskarls have joined them in their rebellion, and they remain a destabilizing influence on the country."
OLV_noble_resistance_2:0 "Foringjar Resistance"
OLV_noble_resistance_2_desc:0 "The dogged resistance of the revolting nobles is losing its steam, and morale amongst their troops is faltering. Even some of the nobles have been forced to admit that they cannot openly challenge the government and expect to win."
OLV_noble_resistance_3:0 "Foringjar Remnants"
OLV_noble_resistance_3_desc:0 "The revolt of the nobility is almost at an end. Swathes of their troops desert or surrender to the government, and the few nobles still left in the Foringjar have no ability to equip or pay for the training of anymore. This rebellion will soon be crushed."
OLV_banditry_1:0 "Rampant Banditry"
OLV_banditry_1_desc:0 "Banditry has always been a problem within Austurland, but the issue has now grown to immense proportions. Bandit leaders rule large sections of the countryside as petty warlords, severely damaging the legitimacy of the government."
OLV_banditry_2:0 "Banditry"
OLV_banditry_2_desc:0 "Banditry is a less prevalent problem than it has historically been, but the problem still persists. Villages and towns are routinely raided, and sections of the road network are simply unsafe to travel. "
OLV_banditry_3:0 "Negligible Banditry"
OLV_banditry_3_desc:0 "The few remaining bandits in Austurland have been corralled into a few isolated locations. Many are simply surrendering to the authorities, as patrols of Huskarls have made their lifestyle untenable."
OLV_commoner_resistance_1:0 "Chaos In The Countryside"
OLV_commoner_resistance_1_desc:0 "The government has completely lost the support of the common citizens of the country, large swathes of the countryside openly defy the central government, and the cities suffer daily riots. If the government intends to regain any legitimacy, it must put an end to this anarchy."
OLV_commoner_resistance_2:0 "Rioting"
OLV_commoner_resistance_2_desc:0 "The current government has little popular support, and demonstrations against the regime have turned into full-blown riots. Many deer are losing faith that the government will protect them, and the situation is dire. "
OLV_commoner_resistance_3:0 "Unrest"
OLV_commoner_resistance_3_desc:0 "Protests against the government are common, though mostly peaceful. Popular opinion is divided, with many opposing the government enough to protest openly."

### Focuses ###

#initial# 

OLV_jarl_ygritte:0 "Our Jarl"
OLV_jarl_ygritte_desc:0 "The Jarl of Austurland is somewhat of an reclusive figure, her past known to few. Perhaps it would be the ideal course to share her story, to better relate with her subjects? The disposition of a leader often reflects on their nation."
OLV_hold_court:0 "Call Upon The Althing"
OLV_hold_court_desc:0 "Since time immemorial, the Althing has been called by the rulers of Austurland. It is a gathering of the landed elite, during which disputes are settled, and a semblance of national strategy is set. The Jarl is required to summon her vassals, as tradition demands it."
OLV_host_a_feast:0 "A Grand Feast"
OLV_host_a_feast_desc:0 "With the Althing concluded, the Jarl is further required to hold a splendid display of hospitality - a banquet of the powerful, the night spent through celebrating, carousing and commemorating. It is a further opportunity for the Jarl to strengthen alliances with the Austurland's finest."
OLV_settle_disputes:0 "Settle The Disputes"
OLV_settle_disputes_desc:0 "As the highest and final authority of the land, the Jarl is obligated to resolve feuds that arise between her vassals. As she holds everydeer's allegiance, it is a civilised method of settling scores, without falling into a cycle of vengeance. A particularly clever judgement may further impress her subjects."
OLV_survey_the_land:0 "Examine The Land Contracts"
OLV_survey_the_land_desc:0 "On paper, the nation itself, the very soil on which hooves tread belongs to the Jarl. Naturally, such an arrangement hasn't been factual for a long time, as grateful jarls of the past distributed acres to valuable subjects. However, she still has the right to seize land from disloyal subjects, and manage the land without an owner as the Jarl sees fit."
OLV_new_nobles:0 "Controlling The Land"
OLV_new_nobles_desc:0 "Surveying the nation has revealed that the borderlands towards dreadful Barrad are lacking in proper defences and deer to patrol for any raids. With the Jarl being the sole owner of this particular stretch of land, it is up to her to decide the ideal strategy for long term protection of the commondeer inhabitating the area."
OLV_the_grand_council:0 "A Grand Council"
OLV_the_grand_council_desc:0 "Being the ruler of the nation does not make the Jarl an unquestionable autocrat. Instead, she must work in harmony with her noble subjects, in order to syncretise the needs and obligations of both. Indeed, the yearly report from her most powerful vassals approaches."
OLV_call_upon_warriors:0 "The Warrior Lodges"
OLV_call_upon_warriors_desc:0 "In a culture such as Austurland's, warriors are held in high esteem, and that has given them a sense of pride and honour. Nodeer wishes to serve a weakling, and the Jarl needs to prove herself as worthy of any fighter in the land. Earning their respect should be a priority for any ruler."
OLV_encourage_vikings:0 "The Vikingar Question"
OLV_encourage_vikings_desc:0 "What others call rampant raiding, we proud deer call tradition. It is common for young bucks and does to join vikingar parties in search of glory, honour and plentiful loot to live comfortable lives. However, the rapidly changing world is making this lifestyle more dangerous and uncertain, and the Jarl must decide how to approach this conundrum."
OLV_bandits:0 "The Bandit Issue"
OLV_bandits_desc:0 "The unforgiving life in Austurland results in many desperate deer becoming fugitives and criminals, caring nothing but for their own personal interest. Their numbers have waxed and waned over the years, but lately they are considered to be a particular menace. The Jarl must protect her subjects and rid herself of this threat."
OLV_noble_warriors:0 "The Huskarls"
OLV_noble_warriors_desc:0 "Professional soldiers, one and all, the huskarls are not just Austurland's elite, but they also hold personal loyalty of their own warriors serving under them. The Jarl holds personal ambition to reform the nation's armed forces, and for this she needs the cooperation of these influential retainers."
OLV_berserker_issue:0 "The Matter Of The Berserkers"
OLV_berserker_issue_desc:0 "Few command such dread and respect as the berserkers of Austurland. It is said that they give themselves to an unquenchable anger before unleashing a ferocious charge, stopping for nothing until either side is dead. To have the allegiance of these fierce warriors would undoubtedly prove a great boon for the Jarl."
OLV_a_great_expedition:0 "The Future Of Trade"
OLV_a_great_expedition_desc:0 "The dealings of trade and coinage is not something a proud warrior bothers with, but it is instead the domain of Kaupmenn, rich merchants with extensive contacts in distant lands. They may be commondeer, and thus by law uninfluential, but to disregard their financial expertise would not result in a prosperous future for Austurland."
OLV_tour_the_land:0 "Tour The Land"
OLV_tour_the_land_desc:0 "Although the power of her thanes, huskarls and warriors is undeniable, the Jarl must also work to earn the favour and appreciation of her freefolk. They're not numerous and dangerous enough to threaten her rule if roused to anger, but to have their loyalty could prove to be decisive in the future."
OLV_merchant_friends:0 "The Kaupmenn"
OLV_merchant_friends_desc:0 "Austurland's naval tradition has given rise to a wealthy elite who specialise in trading with foreign nations. Many nobles consider them to be upstarts and money hoarders, but it is this affluence they possess that makes the Kaupmenn impossible to ignore. A shrewd Jarl would do well to make a few friends among them."
OLV_trade_grants:0 "A New Trade Charter"
OLV_trade_grants_desc:0 "The accumulated wealth has allowed the Jarl to issue a new charter concerning the expansion of trade and industry in Austurland. It is her own prerogative which business she should support, or would it be best to delegate the matter to some other deer?"
OLV_send_out_the_tax_collectors:0 "Send Out The Taxdeer"
OLV_send_out_the_tax_collectors_desc:0 "Jarls of the past have once personally handled their rightful dues, but over time the collection of taxes has become muddled and unclear. The Jarl needs to have a proper, unbiased perspective on the matter in order to resolve the issues of collecting funds for the state, which would undoubtedly prove useful in the future."
OLV_agricultural_reforms:0 "Assisting the Karls"
OLV_agricultural_reforms_desc:0 "The many farmers of the land simply cannot produce enough to sustain themselves, and satisfy their obligations to their betters. It is a costly affair, but the Jarl needs to personally resolve this if the nation is to progress forward, and the commondeer to find some prosperity in their lives."
OLV_the_thrall_issue:0 "The Thrall Issue"
OLV_the_thrall_issue_desc:0 "On the bottom of the class pyramid are the thralls. A few steps above slavery, a deer could find themselves as a thrall by falling into debt, taken prisoner in a feud, or born from thrall parents. This unfortunate tradition has continued for centuries without much complaint, but recent developments require a firm choice to be made on how will the issue proceed."
OLV_for_the_crown:0 "For The Crown"
OLV_for_the_crown_desc:0 "The Jarl has grown proud and decisive in her rule, and this is reflected in the noble approval she enjoys. Perhaps the time is right to claim further authority. To strengthen her rule over the deer of Austurland. Who could deny her?"
OLV_noble_rights:0 "Revocato Privilegia"
OLV_noble_rights_desc:0 "Of course, the Jarl didn't expect the nobles to simply accept her new, bolstered rulership. Their many privileges ensure they will remain a thorn in her side, and she wishes to eliminate this semblance of opposition. It is up to them to decide whether they will peacefully accept, or be forced under a more intimidating solution."
OLV_rivalries:0 "The Mammoth In The Room"
OLV_rivalries_desc:0 "The way society works in Austurland is simply unsustainable. Both for the freedeer, who pay many tithes, and the Jarl, who has a vision of a more centralised authority. The nobility must be convinced to let go of their thralls, and accept that Austurland is becoming a modernised nation, where the deer work for the benefit of the state, and not their masters."
OLV_jarls_authority:0 "Heavy Lies The Crown"
OLV_jarls_authority_desc:0 "The responsibilities of the Jarl are many and plentiful, and her burden is heavy. But does she need to carry all of her hardships? Are there any deer who are worthy enough to share the duty? That is something for the Jarl to decide on her own volition."
OLV_the_blessing_of_gods:0 "The Blessings Of The Gods"
OLV_the_blessing_of_gods_desc:0 "The seers are one of the many traditions we have carried with us from the far west. It is they who ensure that Austurland is spiritually proper, and that the Gods are satisfied with our piety. But more importantly for the Jarl, it is the seers who bless their reign, ensuring peace and stability."
OLV_for_the_people:0 "For The Commondeer"
OLV_for_the_people_desc:0 "The writing on the wall is plain and obvious - it is the commondeer who will eventually become the new masters of this land. Taught from her experiences, the Jarl has decided it would be best to gradually allow everydeer to have a say in the ruling of the nation, starting from essential rights. The nobles won't agree with her actions, but her reasoning will satisfy them in the end."
OLV_rights:0 "The Bill Of Rights"
OLV_rights_desc:0 "Giving extensive rights to everydeer is a controversial prospect among the conservative elements of Austurland. It naturally follows that giving rights to everycreature would be even worse, and hardly a popular choice even among the commondeer. It is the Jarl's choice to decide on how comprehensive should these privileges be."
OLV_ownership:0 "Promises Of Land Reform"
OLV_ownership_desc:0 "Land remains a contentious issue for the commondeer, who largely do not own the land they work, with the majority of their produce being given to the masters as tax. The Jarl will decide how should the arable land be redistributed, without angering too many deer."
OLV_status_of_noble_titles:0 "The Status Of The Privileged"
OLV_status_of_noble_titles_desc:0 "Sudden change is rarely a good prospect, and the Jarl's recent sweeping reforms have given many whispers to what could tomorrow hold. How radical should these developments be? Are the deer ready to throw off the shackles of the past, and embrace a new ideology, or should their transformation be slow and gradual? The answer is difficult to grasp."

austurland.1.t:0 "On The Matters Of Family"
austurland.1.d:0 "Ygritte counted herself as a fortunate doe, for not everydeer could rise to the challenge and become the Jarl of Austurland. But she also knew that her path to the top was shrouded in mystery, and she didn't care much to share the story. However, if a growing legacy is to be cemented, it needs to be recorded properly. A scribe was needed to properly organise the contents of her life, in a fashion that is simple for everydeer to understand. Ygritte knew just the right doe for the job.\n\n"Gestheiður, it's been too long since we last met. How have you been holding up?", Ygritte courteously offered the aging deer her welcome.\n"I've had better years, my jarl. But I am not getting any younger. What is the purpose of your summons?", the elder deer retorted, carefully taking a seat across Ygritte. Her hold was warm and comfortable, and it would be a shame to miss out on it.\n"You are to use your talents as my official biographer, so that all across the realm may hear of my story."\nGestheiður hid her puzzlement well, and decided not to press for details. She was obligated to provide her jarl with whatever she wished, but hoped there would be enough ink and parchment for the task. With a decent compensation, of course.\n\n"As you wish, my jarl. Shall we start, then? From the beginning, yes?"\nYgritte reclined back in her seat and thoughtfully stroked her hoof over the aged oaken table.\n"My memory can be spotty at times, but I clearly remember that...""
austurland.1.a:0 "...I was born to a lowly family of §RThralls§!."
austurland.1.b:0 "...I was the daughter of a fierce §YBandit§! lord."
austurland.1.c:0 "...I was born to a family of well-off §CMerchants§!."

austurland.2.t:0 "A Peculiar Child"
austurland.2.d:0 ""Of course. Everydeer knows about the Jarl who rose from the gutters of society.", exclaimed Gestheiður, "But what about your fawnhood? What did you do to stand out from the rest?"\n\nYgritte appeared to contemplate for a moment. "Like most fawns, I was carefree and thought myself to be immune to all dangers. Yet, as much as my parents tried to make it easy for me, I still had to join them in the endless chores. As most deer would say, it was good, honest work, but without real reward. Thus, when I had the chance...""
austurland.2.a:0 "...I spent my time caring for the other Thralls."
austurland.2.b:0 "...I spent my time sneaking about and stealing what she could."
austurland.2.c:0 "...I spent my time working the fields."

austurland.3.t:0 "Time Marches On"
austurland.3.d:0 ""It seems that your fawnhood wasn't all that bad, my Jarl." Gestheiður wrote down several notes while waiting for Ygritte to continue.\n\n"I could honestly say that it was decent, as it prepared me for the hardships of life. Eventually, my parents bought their freedom and we became one of the many commondeer that dot the land. Our survival became only slightly more easier, though."\n\n"What happened afterward?"\n\n"My parents grew old and tired, and passed away. After getting them the most respectable burial I could afford, taking what remained of our fortune for myself, I settled into the role of...""
austurland.3.a:0 "...a hardened criminal."
austurland.3.b:0 "...an honest trader."
austurland.3.c:0 "...a Berserker."

austurland.4.t:0 "The Takeover"
austurland.4.d:0 ""I did not expect that, my Jarl. I don't think anydeer knows what exactly you were doing before that day."\n\n"And why should they? I was but one of the many ordinary folk, living a quiet life with myself and a few friends I could find. However, I could not forget the hardships thralldom brought to me and my family. Why should it be fair for honest, upright deer to end up as slaves, not too different from the kind we decry southward, over misfortune? I knew I had to do something about it."\n\n"What happened afterward has become a tale of great invigoration for the downtrodden, my Jarl."\n\n"Which was certainly my intention. Over the coming months, I gathered many thralls and encouraged them to do something about their station in life. The previous Jarl in particular was known for his displays of wanton cruelty, and it didn't take long before we all marched together to Hornavík, where we cast down the tyrant, throwing him out of the highest window in the hold."\n\n"Something taverngoers are fond of reminiscing in songs. But, thralldom did not end?"\n\n"No. I thought it would be simple and straightforward when I took up the mantle of Jarl. Century old social structures will not change from a single uprising, I'm afraid, but eventually, all deer will live in freedom. Or so I hope." Ygritte paused for a moment to grasp her head in hooves, staring at the dark table, candlelights slowly burning out. "Will this be enough for you to write a coherent storyline, Gestheiður?"\n\n"It will suffice, although I expect to be compensated for my time." With that, the old scribe gathered her many parchments, storing them in her saddlebag and slowly made her way to the exit."
austurland.4.a:0 "Farewell, my Jarl. And good luck."

austurland.5.t:0 "A Peculiar Child"
austurland.5.d:0 ""Who could forget the terror that was Bylgjas? His warbands plundered many villages and killed dozens, and even became notorious among our neighbours. But I did not know you were his offspring, my Jarl." Gestheiður appeared intimidated.\n\n"I could say that he felt the same way. My father was a gruff, no-nonsense stag who had little consideration for his family, always looking for new targets to pillage, only caring for us when he had to lay low to evade justice. My mother, bless her kind heart, tried to protect me from the worst, but in truth, Bylgjas was the iron authority that could not be defied."\n\n"It doesn't sound like a particularly positive fawnhood, my Jarl."\n\n"It certainly was not. However, in time my father gained a soft spot for his daughter, teaching me harsh life lessons. The intention was for me to inherit his criminal schemes, but ultimately, I..."
austurland.5.a:0 "...spend my time learning proper things."
austurland.5.b:0 "...became an image of my father."
austurland.5.c:0 "...was swept away by my mother in a grand escape."

austurland.6.t:0 "Time Marches On"
austurland.6.d:0 ""I can't imagine what it was like. Were you happy like that, my Jarl?", Gestheiður asked, aiming to get a larger picture.\n\n"I didn't know any better. All I wanted was to receive my father's affection, which was perennially out of reach. I don't think he ever felt more than a cold approval, as I tried to become closer to him. Eventually, my mother disappeared one day. I never found out how any why, and my father never spoke again of her."\n\nGestheiður placed down her quill. "I am sorry, my Jarl."\n\n"I appreciate that, but there was nothing that could have been done. Bylgjas met his end a few years later, attempting to rob a griffon merchant convoy that was stranded on the coasts. What he didn't see coming, was merchants fighting back with rifles and submachine guns. I like to think that his last thoughts were how he mistreated his family. In the end, having inherited his ill-gotten gains and the loyalty of his deer, I...""
austurland.6.a:0 "...used my wits to create a "legitimate" business."
austurland.6.b:0 "...continued in my father's hoofsteps."
austurland.6.c:0 "...reformed the marauding band into mercenaries."

austurland.7.t:0 "Time Marches On"
austurland.7.d:0 ""Bylgjas must have been greatly angered by this affront, my Jarl."\n\n"I've heard that he shattered a deer's hoof when he heard the news. My mother did everything she could to keep me safe. We never stayed anywhere for too long, and avoided interacting with other deer. A few months later in this exile, we heard that my father died from overindulging on mediocre mead. Some say his heart was heavy with grief, but I don't believe that. If he really cared, he would have reformed."\n\n"Fitting end for a terrible deer.", Gestheiður spoke while taking a fresh parchment.\n\n"Perhaps. It didn't bring us peace, however, as his loyal second-in-command took over the bandits. Gunnar was easily even worse than my father, intensifying his efforts on plundering the countryside, and finding us. He believed we were to blame for Bylgjas's death, and wanted our heads on a pike. Eventually, Gunnar grew bold and powerful enough to threaten Hornavík, and I knew I had to something to prevent further bloodshed. I gathered many deer who were personally slighted by the bandits, and took them to my father's old hideout. I knew Gunnar would be there, the sentimental fool."\n\nGestheiður seemed to be entranced. "What happened next, my Jarl?""
austurland.7.a:0 "I killed him with my bare hooves."

austurland.8.t:0 "The Takeover"
austurland.8.d:0 ""I can't say I am too surprised, my Jarl. You were always adaptable to changing circumstances."\n\n"Quite so. But even this venture became... unsatisfying to me. I started thinking, wouldn't it be better to achieve something more grander? Thus I set my sights on Austurland itself. If the previous Jarl couldn't stop a single band of thieves from becoming a credible threat to the state, then he was unfit to rule. I knew I would do a far greater job than he did."\n\n"But how did you take over? I've heard various stories, that mostly contradict each other."\n\n"You can't trust drunken beggars to give you the truth, Gestheiður. It was very simple, for I...""
austurland.8.a:0 "...used my army to take over Austurland."
austurland.8.b:0 "...spent my wealth to climb to the top."
austurland.8.c:0 "...blackmailed the Jarl into stepping down."

austurland.9.t:0 "The Ascension"
austurland.9.d:0 ""You must have been very brave, my Jarl.", Gestheiður nodded in respectful approval.\n\n"If Gunnar didn't die begging for mercy like a squealing fawn, perhaps I'd consider myself heroic. But we both know what happened next. Gunnar's death didn't stop the bandits from swooping down on Hornavík, like a kettle of vultures flying over a single corpse. Before I could arrive with my own followers, they burned down most of the noble district and killed the Jarl. To this day, I still blame myself for not arriving any quicker."\n\n"You've done all you could, Ygritte."\n\n"I wish that. The bandits did not expect to be interrupted, and we made short work of them. In the end, I was hailed as a hero, and everydeer begged me to take up the mantle of Jarl. As I felt the situation was partially of my doing, I accepted, to make up for my mistakes, and return Austurland to peaceful prosperity." Ygritte paused for a moment to grasp her head in hooves, staring at the dark table, candlelights slowly burning out. "Will this be enough for you to write a coherent storyline, Gestheiður?"\n\n"It will suffice, although I expect to be compensated for my time." With that, the old scribe gathered her many parchments, storing them in her saddlebag and slowly made her way to the exit."
austurland.9.a:0 "Farewell, my Jarl. Our hero."

austurland.10.t:0 "A Peculiar Child"
austurland.10.d:0 ""Your family has always been notable in Hornavík, my Jarl. Some felt you've been destined for greatness."\n\n"Destiny is a fickle thing, Gestheiður. The Gods rarely divulge their plans, and the seers don't always know how to interpret them. However, my fawnhood is best described as carefree and untroubled. My parents ensured I had everything I could ask for, and whenever I could, I...""
austurland.10.a:0 "...spent my time reading and studying."

austurland.11.t:0 "Time Marches On"
austurland.11.d:0 ""Even from early days, you've been making great choices, my Jarl.", Gestheiður spared little praise.\n\n"Nonsense, I merely did what seemed best to me at that time. The fact that it served me well later is merely a coincidence. As I matured, still full of youthful energy, I wanted to do something productive, something remarkable. My parents wanted me to wed some jumped-up stag, but I had none of that. I was not yet ready to settle down, so the first thing I did was...""
austurland.11.a:0 "...travel to the distant lands of the western ponies."
austurland.11.b:0 "...spend my time bartering and trading in the ports."
austurland.11.c:0 "...become notable within Austurland."
austurland.11.e:0 "...joining the fierce Víkingur warriors!"

austurland.12.t:0 "The Ascension"
austurland.12.d:0 ""The tales of your prowess are still popular in taverns, my Jarl."\n\n"I always strived to excel, Gestheiður. That's what my parents taught me - to settle for nothing than the best, and I think I came close to that ideal. Naturally, when the old Jarl died before he could designate a successor, I leaped at the opportunity. I knew no other deer could come close to my talents, and it was a foregone conclusion I would be the next ruler of Austurland."\n\n"But how did you convince the nobles? They're a stubborn lot."\n\nYgritte leaned back in her chair and clapped her forehooves together. "Quite simple. I was chosen because...""
austurland.12.a:0 "...of my wealth."
austurland.12.b:0 "...of my influence."
austurland.12.c:0 "...of my acts of valour."

austurland.13.t:0 "The Althing Session"
austurland.13.d:0 "One of the strangest aspects of Austurlands system of governance is the Althing. Gathered at the command of the High-Jarl, the Althing serves as the general legislative assembly of Austurland, as well as its highest judicial body. The Althing is at the very core of Austurlandian society, and it was critical for any new Jarl to call it to session as soon as possible. \n\nThe assembly itself is composed of the 63 Jarls of Austurland, as well as Goðis from the local temples, with each one representing the free deer that live within their land. A Jarldom is considered the personal property of the Deer that owns it and can be bought and sold just like any other piece of property. Though in Practice families tend to keep a tight hold of their Jarldoms.\n\nAt a glance the Althing might seem like any other parliament, but an important factor that distinguishes it from others is the fact that every session is, in theory, open to any free deer that wants do attend. While this commitment to letting at least some of the commondeer a view into the inner workings of government might be admirable, it did tend to result in sessions looking more like crazed feasts than proper assemblies. And this year's session certainly didn't seem to be bucking the trend.\n\nIndeed, the first Althing of High-Jarl Ygritte might go down history as one of the most turbulent sessions of parliament within Austurland. Several Jarls were maimed or killed in hólmgangs, a type of ceremonial duel. The various merchants attending the Althing made sure that no legislating would be done while anydeer was sober, and the veritable horde of common deer present made sure that the festivities were lively. \n\nAll in all, a very successful showing for the new Jarl."
austurland.13.a:0 "That went well? Could have been worse."

austurland.14.t:0 "The Grand Feast"
austurland.14.d:0 "The feasts of Austurland, like most of their other traditions, tended to be an exercise in chaos more than any organized event, as each Jarl was expected to show up with his own personalized contribution to the event. This, in turn, meant that, while the feast varied in cuisine and entertainment, there was little to no coherent organization behind it. But as Ygritte saw the revelry unfold before her, she was convinced that the feasts of Austurland stood head and shoulder over whatever the ponies could hope to muster up.\n\nBut the least significant part of a feast was the feast itself, far more important were the connections that could be made during them, as no deer of importance in Austurland would refuse to show up at a Grand feast being held by the Jarl herself. Every notable deer within the country had shown up, \n\nThe most respectable and prestigious members of the Althing were gathered around her, and naturally, a few fights had broken out already. Some fool Jarl had decided to bring along an entire retinue of víkingar along, two Jarls were furiously arguing about which one's contribution to the feast was better, and a dispute about a dead Huskarl had turned violent.\n\nIf Ygritte didn't do something soon, the entire feast would erupt into a frenzy of violence. And while a nice spicing of conflict would liven her feast up a bit, she did need to divert their attention if she wanted to get anything done today. "
austurland.14.a:0 "Tell them the story about the ass and the honeycomb."
austurland.14.b:0 "Discuss their tax policy with them."
austurland.14.c:0 "Woo them with tales of your valour."
austurland.14.e:0 "Spend the night away socialising with them."
austurland.14.f:0 "Discuss trading ventures with them."

austurland.15.t:0 "The Dispute"
austurland.15.d:0 "One of the most important roles of the Jarl of Austurland is resolving feuds between the various noble families within the country. Indeed, one of the primary reasons the position was created in the first place was to stop the entire country from killing each other every few years. But while Ygritte did her best to nip any budding feuds in the bud before they could grow into anything serious, sometimes it was impossible to resolve every single argument in a timely manner.\n\nIt all started, as most feuds did, over a crime so petty it was barely worth mentioning. The two nobles involved, Hafnfríður the Deep Minded and Kjartan Þorleiksson, had been attending the Grand feast, only for a scabbard owned by one of Hafnfríður's retainers to go missing. Days later it was found in a nearby swamp, and after a few heads had been knocked over the culprit was found to have been Kjartans son, who had mistakenly taken it in a drunken stupor during the feast, and subsequently lost it. \n\nKjartan offered to pay for the replacement of the scabbard, but Hafnfríður found the sum to be insultingly low and refused to accept it. Later that week, one of Hafnfríður's Thralls had been found stealing from Kjartans granary, and was quickly killed by the annoyed Kjartan.  This prompted Hafnfríður to send a cadre of Vikingar over to Kjartans estate to collect payment for the dead Thrall, without asking Kjartan for permission.\n\nOn and on the feud went until eventually Kjartan's son was killed by a drunk Viking in Hafnfríðurs employ, leading to a series of revenge killings that were ready to spill out into open warfare between the two houses at any moment. The nobles had decided to appeal to Ygritte for arbitration to prevent the feud from escalating further, and something clearly had to be done."
austurland.15.a:0 "The dispute was forgotten as the two nobledeer bonded over their hatred of you."
austurland.15.b:0 "You decide to simply seize their land and give it to the commondeer."
austurland.15.c:0 "You quickly grow angry by the nobledeer's bickering, and fly into a rage ultimately killing them both."
austurland.15.e:0 "You gracefully defuse the situation and manage to get the two to settle their dispute peacefully."
austurland.15.f:0 "You decide to plot with one of the nobledeer to seize the other's land."
austurland.15.g:0 "Using your knowledge of the local geography you fairly distribute the land between the two nobledeer."
austurland.15.h:0 "You decide to seize the land and distribute it amongst your loyal warriors."

austurland.16.t:0 "The Excess Land"
austurland.16.d:0 "As Ygritte began to settle into her role as Jarl, she quickly grew used to one of the most common tasks given to her, namely settling land disputes between rival nobles. Austurland was not a very large country, and any excess land available would quickly be claimed by the nearest noble family as part of their domain. Inevitably leading to a patchwork of conflicting claims that would eventually lead to conflict if not resolved.\n\nBut today's dispute was far from normal, as in a display of incompetence so great that it genuinely managed to impress Ygritte, two noble families had somehow managed to wipe each other out completely during a blood feud, leaving a large parcel of land with no clear living claimant. In such cases, it fell upon the Jarl to distribute the land however she saw fit.\n\nThe most obvious solution would be to simply give it over to the nobles to argue over, saving herself the headache of trying to figure out this mess that had appeared before her. Otherwise, she could do with it as she wished, but showing overt favor to any social group in Austurland would surely anger the others."
austurland.16.a:0 "You decide to give it all to the commondeer."
austurland.16.b:0 "You decide to distribute it to your loyal warriors."
austurland.16.c:0 "You decide to sell off the land for personal profit."
austurland.16.e:0 "You decide to equally distribute the land amongst your supporters."
austurland.16.f:0 "You decide to give the land to the nobles and let them sort it out."

austurland.17.t:0 "The Matters Of Bureaucracy"
austurland.17.d:0 "As the Jarl of Austurland, Ygritte had the right to claim strategic areas that bordered the neighboring nations of Austurland for the purposes of national defense. And in a recent survey of the border between Austurland and Barrad had found a series of villages that were precariously ill defended due to neglect from the local nobles, being vulnerable to a possible raid by the crazed wizards of the magocracy, the deer being abducted for some vile magical experiments.\n\nYgritte quickly set about claiming the region and reinforcing the border with proper defenses. But as she was now the owner of the villages and the surrounding areas, she had to determine what to do with the administration of the region.\n\nShe could simply give it off to some noble, no doubt pleasing them merely by making them feel important. Alternatively, she could give it as a reward to some of her more renowned retainers, bolstering the region's defenses and increasing the loyalty of the deer sworn to her. Lastly, she could just let the villagers themselves handle the administration, they would no doubt be happy to be able to exercise some autonomy for a change."

But as observed the cold looks from the few nobles that had bothered to answer her summons, she was quickly realizing how wrong she had been.\n\nBe it due to neglect, jealousy or just sheer dislike of her character, the nobility had all but directly renounced her authority by refusing her summons.  But if they had expected this to have a discouraging effect on her, then they had sorely miscalculated.\n\nIf the fools wanted to ignore her authority, let them. They had made it quite clear that any effort spent on appeasing them would be wasted by the lot of inbred lunatics. They would quickly learn how large of a mistake they had made when she consolidated her hold over the country."

The most influential and powerful nobles had all answered her summons, bringing along a great amount of tribute, as well as food and drink to ensure that the council could be properly fed. \n\nThey had celebrated and discussed the first few weeks of her rule for days. And with every subsequent day, the revelry grew louder and more gregarious. When the council was finally dismissed Ygritte's grand hall had to be closed for days to clean up the mess, but during the festivities, she had all but secured the absolute loyalty of the nobility of Austurland.\n\nWith the support of the nobility secured, for the time being, Ygritte could turn her attention to other matters of state. And perhaps this fruitful relationship she had cultivated could grow into something more given time."

austurland.20.t:0 "The Mead Hall"
austurland.20.d:0 "The ferocious deer of Austurland have fought both each other and the local inhabitants of the country ever since it was settled, and thus there exists a large and powerful martial cast within Austurlandian society. These warriors have traditionally kept close ties amongst themselves, and no proper town is complete without a warrior lodge.\n\nAnd of all the lodges in Austurland, none are greater than the one located in Hornavík, the one Ygritte stood before. The great wooden structure, known as Hergarður by the locals, sat at the edge of a small peninsula with its back towards the sea. While gaining access without completing the prerequisite trials of strength would normally be impossible, her position as Jarl let her bypass normal tradition. \n\nWith a small amount of trepidation, Ygritte threw open the doors to the main hall, and then promptly ducked to avoid a stray throwing axe. The inside of the lodge could charitably be described as festive, as the mightiest deer of Austurland caroused, fought and regaled each other with stories of their exploits. Winning over this bunch would surely be a challenge."

austurland.21.t:0 "The Vikingar Question"
austurland.21.d:0 "While Austurland does produce some of its wealth through traditional economic methods, it cannot be denied that the vast majority of the coin that flows through Austurland comes by the way of the Vikings. Going on a Viking is something of a rite of passage for all deer within Austurland, but the ones who truly dedicate themselves to the endeavor can easily become some of the most dangerous and wealthy deer in the entire country, so long as they survive that is.\n\nAlthough going on a Viking does not inherently mean that a deer intends to raid and pillage, as it is common for deer to trade with foreign merchants during a Viking, in practice the richest and mightiest of the Vikings are all primarily focused on raiding. And while this does mean that most Vikings are skilled in combat, it does also tend to attract more unsavory characters to the lifestyle.\n\nThe Vikings are away for most of the year, returning only when they are satisfied with their plunder from their journey, but when they return it is a sight to behold. Ygritte watches as carts of valuables are unloaded from the ships of a newly arrived company of Vikings. Many are missing horns and bear the scars of many battles. But while the Vikings bring much wealth to Austurland, they do little to encourage positive relations with the neighbors. Perhaps a change of policy is in order."

austurland.22.t:0 "The Bandit Issue"
austurland.22.d:0 "If a deer is judged to have killed another deer without letting it draw its weapon, or is found guilty of crimes so egregious that they are unforgivable, yet not deserving of death, that deer is judged an outlaw. As an outlaw, the deer may not enter any civilized settlement in Austurland, and has no protection by the laws of the realm. Any outlaw may be slain without punishment, and dealing with one is considered bad luck, making them social pariahs. \n\nAs a result of this, many of Austurland's outlaws are forced band together to form bandit groups, pillaging their way through the countryside in an effort to survive. Ygritte knew that the banditry problem within her realm had grown far beyond acceptable levels, but she could not deny that many of these deer had no other choice but to turn to such a lifestyle. \n\nHer army was mighty enough to root out the most troublesome groups in direct assaults and to wipe out the rest over a few weeks of effort, but perhaps that would be letting capable deer go to waste. If these bandits could be persuaded to work for her, she would gain a force of deer trained in combat and not beholden to anyone but herself, the most useful thing to have within Austurland. But such an action would fly in the traditions of Austurland, and would do little to endear her to the nobility. But after a few hours of contemplating, Ygritte had made up her mind. "
austurland.22.a:0 "You decide to dispense some hard justice."
austurland.22.b:0 "You decide to make them an offer they can't refuse."

austurland.23.t:0 "The Huskarls"
austurland.23.d:0 "When Ygritte had decided to present her proposal for a unified Austurlandian army with a centralized command structure to the Huskarls of Austurland, she had expected some pushback. Taking away the retinues of the nobles and forcing them to work together for once would no doubt be difficult, but she had hoped that the commanders of the Huskarls would be sensible enough to see reason if she pushed on the matter. And so she had called the leaders of the largest Huskarl retinues to her hall to discuss her plans for the reformation of the army.\n\n"This proposal flies in the face of the traditions that have kept Austurland together for decades! Our ancestors came here to escape this very kind of tyranny.", the old buck shouted while stamping down a hoof. Earning murmurs of approval from the rest of the gathered commanders.\n\nSo far it wasn't going well. \n\nEvery single point of her proposal had been either ridiculed or rejected, and it was clear that the Huskarls would resist any change to the status quo. But she could only tolerate so much disrespect before her patience ran out, and it was time to remind these bucks who exactly she was.\n\n"You have made all your opinions on this quite clear, and I will respect the rights our traditions grant you. But no matter what you think of me or my plans, I am still your Jarl, and you would do well to remind yourselves of that. The army will be reorganized with or without your approval, and that will be my final word on this matter. You are all dismissed."\n\nThe commanders knew better than to directly refuse an order from their Jarl and limited themselves to giving her icy glares as they left to return to their respective posts. It was clear that they would fight her every step of the way when it came to military reform."
austurland.23.a:0 "§RThey didn't like your plan for a new Austurland army.§!"

austurland.24.t:0 "The Huskarls"
austurland.24.d:0 "The Huskarls of Austurland were made up of the sons and daughters of nobles with no prospect of inheriting any titles. They dedicated themselves entirely to the martial arts, receiving the best possible training and education that their noble families could afford, creating a force of capable and loyal soldiers who would be placed in charge of the local retinues of the nobility. \n\nBut as Austurland became increasingly threatened by neighboring nations looking for an easy target, it became clear to Ygritte that a national military was sorely needed. And to establish one, she would need to integrate the Huskarls and the noble retinues to establish a strong core for her armies to grow around. But the Huskarls were proud enough that if she didn't frame her wording correctly, they would only see the reforms as a violation of their rights.\n\nSo instead of "centralizing the military bureaucracy", she was simply "granting the Huskarls the respect they deserved by removing the shackles of the nobility from them". \n\nAfter all, they only held their positions as long as the nobles favored them, and would quickly be relieved of command should they get too uppity. By transferring to a centralized military under her command, they would not only secure their positions but also gain the ability to advance their own agenda independent of the nobility. \n\nThus, once she had presented the reforms under the pretenses of addressing an issue with the lack of respect given to the Huskarls, her plans had been met with unanimous approval. With the loyalty of the Huskarls secured, the positions of the nobility had weakened considerably. And they would surely be feeling a lot more loyal knowing that the Huskarls were ready to detain them at the first sign of dissent."
austurland.24.a:0 "§GThey liked your plan for a new Austurland army.§!"

austurland.25.t:0 "The Berserker Issue"
austurland.25.d:0 "While the Huskarls might have the most professional training, and the Vikings the most direct experience, there is no group of deer within Austurland that could hope to match the sheer ferocity of the berserkers. Though few in number, there is no force on Griffonia that could stop a charge by a group of maddened berserkers. \n\nGaining their official support would grant any ruler of Austurland a great deal of respect from the commondeer, as well as a powerful force of loyal shock troops. But so far no Jarl had succeeded in this task, a trend that Ygritte intended to buckle. In the past, they had proven immune to promises of wealth and power, but perhaps another approach would work. \n\nShe approached them, not as their Jarl, but as just another resident of Austurland. She explained that the status quo could not be allowed to continue, and asked for their support. She did so plainly, and without embellishment, making her plans as clear as day to them. She had never expected it to work.\n\nAnd yet somehow it did. Perhaps her arguments had truly convinced them, or they had simply respected her earnestness compared to previous attempts at courting them. Nevertheless, they declared their open support for her reforms, doing wonders for the legitimacy of her rule."
austurland.25.a:0 "§YSurprisingly enough, they agreed with you.§!"

austurland.26.t:0 "The Berserker Issue"
austurland.26.d:0 "The word "Berserker" brings many images to mind, most involving crazed deer charging headfirst into battle while consumed by a frenzy of violence. But to dismiss the orders of the berserkers as collections of maddeer obsessed with a lust for battle is to reach the heights of ignorance. Ygritte knew this because she had held that very same opinion when she was young.\n\nBut her path in life had been a hard one, eventually leading to her seeking refuge within the halls of an order of berserkers when she had nowhere else to go. It was there where she had understood the truth behind the berserkers. Contrary to common belief, berserkers tended to be relatively normal while they were not in battle, their life was one of silent training and worship, punctuated by intense spurts of violence.\n\nFor the berserkers, the act of going "Berserk" involved channeling the spirits of their ancestors. Letting the fury of their forebearers who had fallen on the battlefield manifest one more time after their death. It was an act of utmost dedication to Ukko. For many disgraced deer, the path of the berserker was one that would lead to their redemption, a final chance to do right by their ancestors and the gods. \n\nPerhaps it was this understanding of their ways that lead to the berserkers swearing loyalty to her. That, or the fact that she had beaten 10 of their number in a hólmgang. Either way, earning the loyalty of these warriors had been seen as a triumph by both the commoners and her own warriors. Ygritte now had the backing of the mightiest fighters known to deerkind, may the gods have mercy on any who would oppose her."
austurland.26.a:0 "§GThey have decided to swear their fealty to you our of respect.§!"

austurland.27.t:0 "A Trip Around The Countryside"
austurland.27.d:0 "It could not be denied that most of the power in Austurland was centered around a distinct elite of nobles and wealthy merchants. But that did not mean that the support of the commondeer was irrelevant, far from it. Unlike many other feudal realms, the commoners within Austurland held far more power over their rulers than they did at a glance. A noble could not squeeze coin out from the earth with willpower alone, and if he lacked enough thralls to make his Jarldom economically viable, then he would need to attract freedeer to his realm.\n\nAnd unlike thralls, freedeer could simply pack up and move whenever they wanted to. The freedeer within a jarldom served under the jarl of that territory, but the Jarl was also expected through social conventions and the laws of the realm to represent their interests at the Althing. Unlike thralls, although this did not place the commondeer above their lords, it did grant them a distinct amount of power over them. \n\nA noble would quickly find his position eroding if the freedeer he relied upon abandoned him, and thus most would be willing to hear out at least some of their concerns. Ygritte knew this dynamic very well and had every intention of exploiting it to strengthen her rule. If the freedeer could be won over, the nobles who depended upon them would eventually follow. \n\nYgritte had thus decided to take a trip around the more rural areas of Austurland, where the presence of the High-Jarl had not been felt for decades. Her presence would hopefully bolster the popular opinion of her rule. And perhaps the nobility could be written out of the equation entirely if she made herself a hero to the commoners. "
austurland.27.a:0 "It went decently."

austurland.28.t:0 "A Meeting With the Kaupmenn"
austurland.28.d:0 "Austurland might be more famous for its Viking raiders than for commerce, but that did not mean that there was no trade to be found within the country. Indeed, thanks to its strong seafaring traditions, merchants from Austurland were able to conduct trade from the Riverlands to the Gryphus sea. Over decades these merchants had established themselves as a powerful social class of their own, the Kaupmenn. \n\nWhile the nobility mostly refused to embrace modern methods of production and farming, preferring to work their thralls to the bone, the Kaupmenn were never ones to refuse an economic advantage. Acting as one of the sole modernizing forces for Austurland's economy, the Kaupmenn were poised to bring the industrial revolution to Austurland, as long as a healthy profit could be made.\n\nYgritte had every intention of modernizing the economy. If things stayed as they were, even if they were somehow spared a military invasion the sheer economic might of rival countries would render Austurland powerless to repel their influence. \n\nBut courting these merchants would not be as easy as it appeared, as the Kaupmenn were very aware that they held the keys to the economy. And they certainly wouldn't give them over to some upstart noble with no clue about economics. She would have to prove that her plans for economic modernization would significantly benefit the Kaupmenn, or risk their anger."
austurland.28.a:0 "You've made some friends amongst them."

austurland.29.t:0 "The New Charter"
austurland.29.d:0 "Despite the almost feudal state of its economy, Austurland's position along the trade routes between the River Coalition and southern Griffonia ensure that its commerce grew by a small amount every year. Thanks to this, Austurland now had enough capital to set up a new trading charter, which would bring a healthy profit to its owner and enable the state to invest in the local economy.\n\nAs the Jarl, Ygritte had received the newly created charter as her personal property and could invest the profits however she wished. Her investment would be seen as a statement of her support to whatever group received it, which complicated the matter immensely.\n\nOn one hoof, she could use the profits to finance the expansion of Heimstál, a burgeoning manufactory that had been established by the Kaupmenn several years ago. Alternatively, she could invest the profits in expanding her personal armory, allowing her smiths to produce more weapons and to purchase more advanced manufacturing equipment. Lastly, she could just pawn it off to some noble who was willing to pay for it, that would no doubt please the nobles."

austurland.30.t:0 "The Report"
austurland.30.d:0 "Taxation in Austurland, like most other things, differed from the norm across Griffonia. There are very few direct tax obligations, with most lords collecting income through private contracts with freedeer in exchange for their labor and support during the Althing. In turn, the lords provide a tithe to the Jarl in exchange for her approval of their rule. But taxation is not the only source of income for Austurland.\n\nShould a deer commit a crime against another, that crime is punished with a corresponding fine, the right to collect which is awarded to the victim. The victim may then sell the right to collect this fine to a stronger party if they are unable to collect on the debt. Many warriors make a living collecting on small debts in exchange for fees, but large ones are most often sold to the local lord.\n\nIn recent years, a number of nobles had the bright idea to grant their tithe to the Jarl in the form of debts due to be collected. Allowing them to skirt by on direct payment, and it seems like the previous Jarls had all decided to delay collecting these debts. The result of this scheme has caused no small headache for Ygritte, as she now had to send out taxdeer to figure out how and where and to collect on them.\n\nWorse still, many of the debts were of questionable validity, and the commondeer would no doubt react badly to armed warriors coming to collect on debts that might not even be valid in the first place. There were other methods of collection, such as allowing them to pay the debts piecemeal, or even through a blood tax. Alternatively, she could just forgive the debts, but that would necessitate holding the nobles accountable for several years of unpaid tithes, which would no doubt not go over very well."

On paper, the Kaupmenn should have been supportive of her economic reforms, they would make a killing off government contracts and the boost in demand for foreign goods, but alas it had all fallen through. The kaupmenn might have been one of the few modernizing forces within the country, but that did not make them incautious, far from it. \n\nMany nobles resented their swift rise up the social ladder, and as a result, the kaupmenn jealously guarded their wealth and existing revenue streams. Perhaps they had feared reprisal from the nobility, or the new taxes that a strengthened central government could enact. No matter the reason, the fact remained that Ygritte would have to reform the economy without the help of the wealthiest deer in Austurland."

With the hard part over, all that remained was dragging Austurland's economy kicking and screaming into modernity, a daunting task, but one that Ygritte knew that she was up to."

Slavery has been institutionalized within Austurland for decades, and has become increasingly controversial over the years. There is no question that slavery is a barbaric practice, and there are few that would defend the practice on any solid moral grounds, but a large part of Austurlands economy is propped up by the thralls. \n\nThe nobles consider slavery a dirty but ultimately necessary practice, as many a noble house is kept from the bankruptcy through the labor of their thralls. Freeing the thralls would undoubtedly anger these nobles, and would make the lands of many noble families unprofitable overnight. \n\nThe nobles argue that the practice has become so ingrained into the economy that removing it would mean complete economic collapse, and that simply letting the status quo stand is the best option. Others have argued for a gradual phasing out of slavery, to allow the economy to adjust to the loss of free labor. But many slaves still cry out for emancipation, and can Ygritte truly refuse their calls?"

austurland.34.d:0 "The nobles of Austurland, while not as powerful as the nobility in feudal Griffonia, still enjoy a host of privileges and rights that place them far above the common deer. A commoner bringing a legal case against a noble is, at best, ill-advised, and the nobility still retains a large amount of autonomy from Ygritte's government. \n\nConvincing them to give up these rights would go a long way to centralize control over the country over Ygritte, and vastly simplify a number of issues with taxation. But that is far easier said than done. \n\nThe nobles have maintained their rights over many generations, and to say that an upstart jarl challenging those rights would have a tough time of it would be an understatement. But the attempt has to be made. Of course, if diplomacy fails, Ygritte could always grab her axe to convince the nobles to see reason through less discreet ways. "

If Austurland was to advance into modernity, then it would have to leave feudalism behind.\n\nBut realizing that feudalism was holding her jarldom back and abolishing feudalism were two completely different things.

Thus, she seized absolute power overnight, and Austurland was forever transformed. Ygritte would accept no limits on her power, her word would be law, and she would drag her realm into greatness at the end of her axe if she had to.\n\nThere was much to be done, certainly, but with the nobility powerless to hold her back she would be able to enact reforms swiftly. Her warriors stood ready to enforce her decrees, and if necessary to move into the neighboring countries for expansion. Austurland might have been a bit player within Griffonia when it was held back by archaic traditions, but with absolute power in her hands, the griffons would learn to respect Austurland.\n\nYgritte's kingdom was young, but only the foolish would dare underestimate the prowess of her warriors, the ones who had terrorized the shores of southern Griffonia for decades as Vikings.

A large improvement compared to the previous situation, though not perfect. Reforming Austurland into a modern polity would take time, but she did not doubt that she was up to the task. Raising Austurland to parity with its neighbors was now her chief concern, the task would be great, as were the boons to be gained from completing it.\n\nBut she could make time for such matters later.

Thralldom itself was an abomination, locking thousands of able-bodied citizens from ever attaining a good death in battle. \n\nYgritte had resolved to set things right, to reshape Austurland into a society that valued strength above all else.

No matter the result of the blessing, she was sure that the nobility would be appeased by this act.  \n\nUpon her arrival, she was quickly ushered in front of the high Godi, who awaited her. After a customary sacrifice of food had been made to the gods, the ritual could start. Three Völvur enter the room, and attempt to divine which god favors Ygritte. \n\nUltimately opinion was divided. One Völva declared that Ukko, the god of war, justice and wisdom had blessed Ygritte's rule. His blessing signified that her rule would be wise, and full of military conquests. A blessing of Ukko would be greatly appreciated by her warriors, who would count on it to ensure their victory in any coming conflict.\n\nOn the other hoof, another völva declared that Pellervo had granted her his favor. Explaining why the blessing of the god of harvest and fertility would be beneficial was hardly necessary . And the common deer would certainly appreciate such a blessing. \n\nThe decision ultimately lay in the hands of the final völva, and Ygritte could do little but wait."

Nevertheless, Ygritte persisted tirelessly in the task along with her dutiful scribes. Thankfully she did not have to invent everything from scratch, as the neighboring River Coalition provided ample examples of how a more egalitarian set of laws could be composed. \n\nStrong protections against illegal imprisonment were enacted, freedom of speech was assured to a degree, the Althing reorganized into a proper democratic parliament and many more reforms were enshrined in a new bill of rights. The enactment of which would be one of Ygrittes final direct acts as the Jarl of Austurland. \n\nAnd yet, despite all the progress she had made in the past few months, a single question remained unanswered. Should the rights granted by the bill extend to every living being in Austurland, or would they simply be confined to the majority deer population? \n\nCertainly, making these new rights exclusive to the deer would improve her popularity with all but a small minority of Austurlands population. And yet, it did feel like the legalistic equivalent of giving up at the finish line. Ygritte pondered this long into the night, before finally making her decision."

austurland.42.d:0 "As the power of the nobility wanes within Austurland, the topic of land reform has become unavoidable. The nobility currently owns a vast majority of land within Austurland, and even freedeer are forced to enter into contracts with the nobles should they hope to feed their families outside of the major cities. The common deer demanded land reform, and Ygritte saw little reason to deny it. \n\nShe might have been more sympathetic to the side of the nobles if they had, at the very least, actually used most of the land they owned. But the irrefutable fact was that the nobility is often completely uninterested, or incapable, of putting their vast estates to good use. The nobility was notoriously reluctant to invest in any industrial developments on their lands, and any manufactory that managed to secure a contract with a noble would inevitably be forced to direct most of its profits to a deer who had done nothing beyond being born a noble.\n\nThere was no question that land reform was coming, but Ygritte could have some say in how it would be enacted. The solution most popular with the commoners would undoubtedly be to distribute the land to whoever works upon it, but there was no guarantee the new owners would but the land to better use than the previous ones. Ygritte could not deny that simply nationalizing the lands of the nobles would grant her far more power to shape Austurland for the better, but whether her rule could survive such an unpopular act was an open question."

Her reforms were progressing beyond all reasonable expectations, resistance from the nobility was muted at best, and her popularity with the common deer had never been higher. And yet there lay the problem that had challenged her the past few nights, the gap between her and the "common" deer. \n\nNo matter how many reforms she passed, there was no bridging the vast divide that lay between her and the vast majority of her fellow citizens of Austurland. She was their monarch, and they were fundamentally beneath her, there was no arguing that.  True, she was popular, but she lacked a true mandate from the citizens, and could she really make any claims about popularity as long as her subjects had no other choice but to live under her whims.\n\nAfter she first encountered this dilemma, she quickly ordered a constitution to be drafted, in preparation for transforming Austurland into a  constitutional monarchy. At first, she had considered it a fitting compromise between the old and the new, but as the days went she found her opinion shifting. Perhaps she was subconsciously unwilling to let go of the crown, desperate to retain the power she had condemned.\n\nShe might have been reading too much Aquelian philosophy lately, but Ygritte knew there was only one true remedy to this problem. Abolishing the monarchy, and turning Austurland into a republic. A drastic measure to be sure, but could she really claim to adhere to her reformist principles if she was unwilling to take this final step. \n\nYgritte sat on upon her throne and waited for the sun to rise.

If Ygritte was to finish the process of reform, she would have to abolish the monarchy. There was no room for doubt in her mind. \n\nPerhaps she would have been more reluctant to do so if her principles were less ironclad, but she saw no reason to keep such an antiquated institution around after it had served its purpose.

The existing institutions of Austurland had clearly failed, but where words had failed her, force of arms would not.\n\nRelying on the tolerance of the nobility to maintain the authority of the Jarl had been a mistake. And Ygritte saw no reason why democracy would fare any better. Austurland needed something different. A form of government that was not declared, but enacted. A form of government where there was no need to differentiate between her political and military authority, where they were one and the same.\n\nHer warriors, aided by their new berserker allies, would go out and enact her will, that was all that she needed.  It was a simple form of governance, but she could not justify any creature suffering under slavery for another day within her realm. And should anydeer resist, then they would be free to challenge her authority with their own, and witness the might of the berserkers firsthoof. She almost felt sorry for the nobles.\n\nAlmost."

And through the labor of their thralls, they had prospered beyond their wildest dreams. And now it was all crashing down around him.\n\nThey had been free. Free from toiling on the fields, from poverty, all thanks to thralldom. Of course, freedom was properly distributed according to rank, it was only natural that the nobility enjoyed an abundance of it. Indeed, a civilization without slavery could never have truly free citizens.\n\nThey should have seen it coming, the slow erosion of their rights should have tipped them off. Ygritte had challenged their rights slowly at first, if only the nobility had united and overthrown her then. But instead, they had merely grumbled, and now she demanded they free the thralls and relinquish their titles, or face her warriors in battle. \n\nSturla had planned to raise his Huskarls in rebellion and join up with the others still willing to fight. But that had been a few hours ago when Ygrittes and her berserkers hadn't been battering down his door. He had no idea how she had reached him so quickly, she had to have been planning this for a long time. Sturla reached for his sword, though despite his name he doubted he would be able to do as much as lay a scratch on the Jarl.\n\nWith a great crash, Ygritte and her berserkers finally managed to break through the door.

For today, they lay wide open, and the halls beyond them burned. \n\nHe could see a veritable army of berserkers surrounding the various estates beyond the gates, and at their head stood Jarl Ygritte, seemingly giving a speech, surrounded by curious commoners. Kári approached her, joining the throng of commoners surrounding her in an attempt to hear what she was saying. And as he got closer, the words of the Jarl grew clearer. \n\n"The nobles are little more than parasites, stealing from Ausurland and giving nothing in return. Today that ends, and though it is a greater mercy than they deserve, I am willing to give them one offer of mercy. I have extended the same offer to every member of the nobility.

From there, she might have made her way to Kasa and enjoyed life as an equal citizen for the first time. But she had found herself unable to justify such an action.\n\nCould she enjoy her freedom, knowing that thousands of thralls just like her still labored for the profits of their uncaring masters? No. And so she set out into the wilderness of Austurland, with nothing but the clothes on her back and the axe of her former master to her name. What followed was a lifetime of strife and conflict. \n\nShe had found a group of thralls like her, the Frjáls Hreindýr. And together they had waged their little war against the nobility. At first, they had simply ambushed the occasional patrol of noble guards, looting their equipment from their bodies and covering their tracks. With each encounter, they grew a bit stronger.\n\nOver time their notoriety had grown, and they had been shaped into a small but dedicated company of warriors. But now, they faced the prospect of becoming rebels without a cause. Jarl Ygritte had declared Thralldom an abomination, as it was, and had proceeded to do most of the work of the Frjáls Hreindýr for them. Nomiki could not deny that this was in a way the very thing they had always dreamt of, and yet she found herself filled with a strange sense of emptiness. Had their efforts truly been for nothing, their life's work accomplished by an upstart Jarl in a fraction of the time?\n\nIn the end, Nomiki found her answer.

He easily blocked the blow, countering with a deliberately weak kick, and assumed his defensive stance once more. "Blind anger won't get you anything except an early grave Dís, you should think before you act if you want to hit me." \n\nHer reply was little more than a growl, she had shown little inclination for conversing with him since she had arrived. And he had to admit that he knew little about the interests of a former noble heiress. He still tried to talk to her, though he had yet to hold a conversation longer than 30 seconds.\n\nThe Austurlandian nobility took care to raise their heirs in a very particular manner. Their children were expected to be loud, forceful, and proud. It was common to reward particularly temperamental children as the nobility believed that this encouraged a strong personality befitting a noble. More often than not it only encouraged arrogance and cruelty.\n\nAnd now that the nobles were out of the picture, the duty of raising their children fell upon the berserkers. He tried to fix her upbringing, to teach her temperance and humility, though he took care not to be overzealous. Noble or not, the doe had just lost her parents, and he was a poor replacement. He made sure to respect that particular boundary.\n\nHe also had to admit that he was more comfortable within a fight than out of one. His new daughter had a lot of aggression within her, and if she did not find a way to deal with it, then it would prove her undoing. And as if to prove his point, another strike of raw anger, he prepared to block it, just as before. But then something he had not anticipated happened. \n\nThe strike revealed itself to be a feint, and he suddenly found himself out of position when she quickly changed the direction of the strike.

Matu just wished that Kyros had taken the chance and come with him to the Free State, yet Kyros had stayed behind, and all Matu could do was to hope that he would be okay.\n\nHe wondered how much of his old life remained in the Free State.  After fifteen years of thralldom, ever since a dodgy repair of his ship had left him stranded in Austurland, he supposed he'd have to be happy if anything was left. Would his friends remember him? Was his family doing okay? Was Mansu Erba still in charge? At least now, he could find out."
austurland.63.a:0 "Going back home, at last."

austurland.64.t:0 "The Reparations"
austurland.64.d:0 ""So..." Kyros said slowly, processing what the deer had told him. "If we learn to read and write, and send our foals to school, then you pay us?" About one hundred former thralls were sitting in the barn as they listened to the bureaucrat from Hornavik, but Kyros wasn't quite certain he had heard him right. "Why?" he asked, not understanding what the reasoning was here. \n\n"Because a diligent farmer could have saved money over time, but even the most diligent ex-thrall has pretty much nothing as it is. At the same time, Austurland's economy was built on thralls for a long time, meaning that if we are really to right the wrongs of the past, we have to make it up to those who built this nation. Put simply, consider it back pay."\n\n"So why not just give us the money?" a griffon asked from further back in the room.\n\n"Because - and I say this with the utmost respect - if you are given a lifetime's wages just like that, it would be wasted within a few months. We don't want you to have just money, we want to make sure that your futures are secure not just for tomorrow, but for the future as well."\n\n"And flooding the fields won't water then, it'll destroy the crops," Kyros summarized, managing to grasp what was going on. "You need to water regularly so that it'll grow well."\n\n"Precisely," the deer smiled."
austurland.64.a:0 "Your pasts won't chain your futures."

austurland.65.t:0 "Siðferðislög"
austurland.65.d:0 "As the state starts to play a larger role in day to day life within Austurland, the enforcement of moral behavior has gone from social to legal. The recently enacted Siðferðislög, or moral laws, drafted by the conservative majority within the Althing aim to make every deer in Austurland lead a moral life. \n\nThe new laws include restrictions on the type of work allowed on days of worship, the enforcement of hospitality traditions, as well as a clear outline for what constitutes an offense worthy of a duel. While in other nations these laws might have been seen as government overreach, within Austurland they have been received with some amount of celebration. \n\nMany deer hope that these laws will help abate the long-standing problem of tribal blood feuds, by clearly establishing how such things are to be dealt with. The time of duels to the death over honor might not be over, but entire dynasties will no longer wipe each other out in senseless cycles of revenge."

austurland.66.t:0 "The Takmarkaður Ríkisborgararéttur"
austurland.66.d:0 "The issue of citizenship rights for non-deer had been fiercely debated in Austurland over the last few weeks, and the matter had now come to a head in the Althing. An act that proposed to limit the citizenship of all non-deer within Austurland had been introduced, and the vote was rapidly approaching. As the opponents of the act finished their final speeches, the time came for its author to take the podium. \n\nOddgeir Hilmarsson was part of the rapidly consolidating conservative wing of the Althing, and he now prepared to give his final defense of the act before the vote. "The fact of the matter is that Austurland is a nation that was founded by deer, for the deer. We have nothing against other creatures, they may live and work here as they please. But once we start letting every single pony who stumbles across the border vote, as my opponents suggest, then we've gone too far."\n\nA cavalcade of shouts and jeers from the opposing side interrupted his speech, but order was soon restored in the Althing. "You give these foreigners the vote and next thing you know we're in the River Coalition and a bunch of unelected bureaucrats in Rijekograd running the country. The ponies and griffons care nothing for our traditions or values, and thus I see no reason why we should concern ourselves with their opinions. Thank you"\n\nA few minutes later the opposition watched at first with apprehension, and then grave silence as the votes were counted. "With a final tally of 42 votes in favor to 38 against," the Speaker of the Althing announced the final tally with a grave tone. "The motion passes.""

austurland.67.t:0 "Social Conservatism"
austurland.67.d:0 "Political propaganda had never really been put into effect within Austurland, as the decentralized nature of its administration had made such efforts practically pointless. The nobles would give speeches endorsing thralldom, but that was the extent of such matters before Ygrittes ascension as Yarl.\n\nBut with the powers of the Althing being vastly expanded, turning it into a fully functioning legislative body for the first time, the value of a deer's political affiliation sharply rose. And the conservative nature of Ygrittes government meant that the streets of Hornavik were now covered in posters and pamphlets emphasizing the importance of Austurland's traditions and values.\n\nSome, if not most, of it was hardly very well made. But with many Austurlanders now seriously considering their political affiliations for the first time, even primitive efforts were bound to bear fruit. With the campaign further boosted by the efforts of the nobility, general public opinion in Austurland has started to take a distinctly conservative stance."

austurland.68.d:0 "The church has traditionally been an active influence within Austurland, the Godis receive representation in the Althing, and sacrifices to the gods were a normal part of daily life. But as the nation started to Industrialize, religious attendance at temples and open worship started to slowly decline. But with the conservative wing of the Althing gaining more power, the government has set its mind on reversing that course. \n\nThe Atkvæðagreiðsluréttur act gives the government the power to restrict voting rights for insufficiently pious Austurlanders. The local godis of the temple report any deer who do not sufficiently attend temples or worship the gods, and the offending deer promptly receives a message that they no longer have the right to vote.  Of course, the deer may reverse this decision by properly worshiping the gods. Temple attendance is already rising sharply, and the Godis are greatly pleased by the act. "

austurland.69.t:0 "The Art Of The Deal"
austurland.69.d:0 "A full end to thralldom had been deemed politically unviable, and a gradual end to the system had been agreed upon. There was no longer an influx of new thralls into Austurland, but some nobles still clung onto their thralls with no intention of freeing them. It had been the inevitable result of the compromise, too many noble estates relied entirely on slave labor to be profitable, but in that fact lay an opening.\n\nThe newly empowered Althing could not directly free the thralls, but they could restrict what kind of work thralls were legally allowed to do. The value of thralls rapidly diminished once they were no longer allowed to work in the farming or mining sectors of the economy. The Althing simultaneously offered to buy the freedom of thralls at a very reasonable price, and soon the remaining slavers had to choose between bankruptcy or selling off their slaves. In either case, the government would ensure the freedom of their thralls. \n\nIn a few short months, the last few thralls were freed, and Austurland was relieved of the stain of slavery. And though it was not done in a manner most would have liked, the majority of Austurland's citizens celebrated the occasion."
austurland.69.a:0 "And now we'll free them."

austurland.70.t:0 "The Speech"
austurland.70.d:0 "Ygritte stood at a podium in front of her great hall, looking at the throng of deer in front of her, as she prepared to address her subjects. The recent installation of a microphone and broadcasting equipment, purchased at some expense from the River Coalition, meant that none of the deer present would be unable to hear her.\n\nDespite ceding much of her political power to the Althing, she still possessed a great deal of soft power as a respected leader of the country. Soft power that she now intended to use to placate the commondeer. Her decision to slowly phase thralldom out, while being appreciated by the nobles, had hardly won her any favors with the commondeer. She could only hope that her words would calm them as she started her speech.\n\n"Many of you are hearing my voice for the first time, and it is only proper that I speak to address an important issue facing our nation. Thralldom is quickly approaching its end, but I understand that many of you still consider the government's approach to be far too sluggish. Why has the Althing not formally given thralls, even freed ones, the same rights as any other citiz-" Ygritte found herself interrupted by the cries of the mob in front of her, demands for immediate emancipation were shouted at her, but she soon managed to get the crowd back under control.\n\n"I know that many of you still reel at this great injustice, and let me be clear on this, thralldom is an unequivocal moral injustice. But despite what we all might like, the process of properly integrating so many creatures takes time. I promise that someday soon, every Austurlander will be equal in the eyes of the law. But many social and political challenges need to be dealt with first.  I can only ask for your patience while the Althing works tirelessly to ensure equality to all. Thank you. " \n\nAs Ygritte finished and retreated to her hall, she could see no visible change in the crowd, but she hoped that her words had reached some of them."

austurland.71.t:0 "The Birth Of ASS"
austurland.71.d:0 "The political landscape of Austurland has been in a state of stasis for decades, the insular and backward nature of the country making a poor platform for political debate. But as the Althing evolves into a proper legislative assembly, new ideas have started to trickle in. Olenian travelers and visitors from the River Coalition have shared tales of a growing ideology in the world, the seeds of which are already starting to take hold within Austurland.\n\nThis process culminated in the formation of a radical new party, one based on class struggle and the fight against the exploitation of the workers. The Austurlenski Sósíalistaflokkur, or ASS for short, has rapidly gained prominence and popularity with many of the former thralls and commondeer in the country. The party has sharply critiqued the unequal distribution of wealth within Austurland, as well as announcing an ambitious party program for welfare and social reform. \n\nWhile the nobility has generally dismissed the ASS as simply another gathering of peasants, the party has also managed to entice many of the more educated deer of Austurland to join. The ideological underpinnings of the party being very robustly developed, due to the help of several visiting Olenian comrades. Despite this, the party has declared itself overtly reformist, and the chances of a communist revolution in Austurland are slim."

austurland.72.t:0 "The First Election"
austurland.72.d:0 "Austurland now prepared for its first fully democratic election. While some degree of royal ascent was still required for legislative matters, a great deal of power had been invested in the position of forsætisráðherra, or prime minister, in effect making them the real leader of the nation. The three major parties within the Althing have been heavily campaigning, as the first Prime minister of Austurland will have the power to shape the countries institutions and economic policy.\n\nThe candidate of the conservative KP is Asbjoern Hallgilsson. A noble by birth, Ásbjörn represents a broad continuation of the old structures of power. His promises of stable development and contacts with the church have made him and his party a force to be reckoned with, but some members of his party have been concerned by his continuous evasiveness about his past. Many nobles have been brought down by the discovery of skeletons in their closets.\n\nNext is the candidate of the AU, Jurek Valgardursson. A noted journalist and the host of Austurlands first radio news broadcast, Jurek seeks to reinforce Austurlands infant democracy, while using the new powers of the government to kickstart the economic development of Austurlands countryside. Many have been drawn in by his humility and friendliness, though his party worries that he lacks the memorability to secure the election.\n\nLast, but certainly not least, is Ulfdis Aresdottir, representing the ASS. Ulfdis is unique amongst the candidates, being the only one to have received a formal education at a university. Ulfdis traveled to the Riverlands as a young doe, working odd jobs to fund her education while becoming involved with the growing communist movements in the region. Upon hearing of Austurland's new reforms, she quickly returned to her homeland and began organizing the ASS. Her parties program of industrialization and welfare has earned them much support with the lower classes of Austurland, who might just decide it's course for the first time in its history."

Three parties have managed to gain enough political prominence to have a chance at winning, but no party commands a lead in the polls yet. The conservative AI, the liberal AU, and the socialistic ASS.\n\nNone would be surprised if the AI came to power, as they enjoy the support of the nobility and the temples, two institutions with a vast amount of influence over Austurlandic society. The AI claims to represent traditional Austurlandic values of piety and honor, and mostly appeals to the more affluent deer within Austurland. An AI mandate would change little about the current shape of Austurlandic society, though many would take that as a good thing.\n\nThe next party with a viable shot at the presidency is the AU. A gathering of liberal scholars and middle-class merchants, the AU would continue the democratizing course Jarl Ygritte put Austurland on, seeking to entrench liberal democracy as the new status quo. \n\nThe final party with any chance of winning is the Austurlandic Socialist Party, or ASS.  The ASS has sharply attacked the other parties, claiming that they simply offered a more palatable version of the thralldom that many had endured before.  While promising to build a society shaped through reason and egalitarianism themselves, instead of letting the old forces of superstition and greed dictate their lives."

He stood before a large mass of deer in the central square of Hornavík, and his message would be recorded and played back on the few radio stations that had started to broadcast within Austurland. But while his parties victory had elated their supporters, many of the former thralls in Austurland felt threatened by it. \n\nThe unrest created by this was simply unacceptable, so again it fell unto the nobility to calm down the peasant mobs. "My fellow citizens, I speak to you today on a matter of the gravest importance, the growing unrest amongst many of our citizens. I recognize that many of you may view my party with hostility, but the fact of the matter is that we won the elections fairly and represent the will of a plurality of these nation's creatures. Despite this, I have heard many accuse us of such acts as bribery and coercion, and even of planning to bring back thralldom."\n\n"Rest assured that we nobles have no desire to drag you back into chains, and quite frankly I find the whole proposition insulting. The nobility made a noble sacrifice in giving up their rightful property. We would not do so only to reverse course at the last minute, such a performance would be insulting to our bloodlines. Thank you, and may the gods bless this great nation." The crowd seemed more confused than inspired by the whole ordeal, but he hoped they got the spirit of the message at least."

austurland.75.t:0 "The Forsætisráðherra's Speech"
austurland.75.d:0 "It was a strange thing, to rely on the common deer for support, thought Asbjoern. He'd been brought up to believe that his right to rule was as natural as the landscape of Austurland, but that idea was now dead and buried. Many of his nation's poorer citizens were alarmed at his party's victory, and in a way, he could see their point. That was exactly why he stood at a podium in the central square of Hornavík, preparing to give a speech that would later be broadcast across the country. \n\nHe could not deny his nervousness when he began to speak, but he did manage to control his voice. "My fellow Austurlanders, I speak to you today to address a question that faces us all. It is a question that concerns the history of both Austurland and myself. Yes, I am a noble, and so are many members of my party. And we acknowledge that the behavior of the nobility has had a greatly negative effect on many of our most disadvantaged citizens in the past."\n\n"But we must not let the mistakes of the past inhibit the progress of the future. I believe my government has the opportunity to drastically improve conditions for each and every resident of this great nation. My hope is that we can work together to bring an era of prosperity and peace to Austurland, and ask you to give us one chance to prove our good intentions."\n\n"I realize that my past may prove uncomfortable for many of you, but I promise that I will not shirk my duties. I was elected to represent all Austurlanders, and that is just what I will do. My party has no desire to move back into the past, but merely to preserve Austurland's unique culture while we move forward."

Each district would elect a leader, who generally organized local governmental services within the district. \n\nThe elections held after the redrawing of the districts were successful, but the AU's candidates suffered a number of rather embarrassing defeats to representatives of the ASS. While many are glad that democracy is starting to become a more important facet of Austurland, the loss of face that this has brought to the party is hard to ignore. \n\nNevertheless, the elections were nonviolent and free, and in the end, that was mostly what the AU had wanted. They would have to strain against uncooperative local governments, but if that was the price they had to pay for Austurlandic democracy, so be it."

austurland.77.d:0 "With their mandate to rule the country secured, the AU had quickly moved to reinforce Austurlandic democracy, as they had pledged during the elections. To do this, municipal districts were redrawn or created across the country, with each one electing a representative responsible for organizing the local government. \n\nThis turned out to be a rather good idea for the party, as the elections were not only held peacefully and efficiently but also expanded the AU's control over many towns and villages. The ASS also managed to secure a few districts, but their gains were ultimately rather understated compared to the AU's. \n\nThis had the effect of not only allowing them to better put their policies into action but also further reinforcing their democratic mandate. The leaders of the party celebrated at a local mead hall long into the night, happy that their vision of a democratic and free Austurland seemed within reach."

The party further went on to declare that Yigittes leadership was at best incompetent, and at worst outright sinister.\n\nThe Jarl's decision to slowly phase out slavery instead of outright abolishing it only fanned the flames and many within the ASS now believe that the current democracy is merely a pretense for the Jarl and the nobles to build up power. Culminating in a violent purge of all dissent and the reinstitution of thralldom. With dissent amongst the commondeer rising, and the ASS losing faith in electoral politics, Austurlands first elections might also be it's last."

austurland.79.d:0 "Despite the best efforts of the government, the political climate within Austurland has started to grow violent. It all started with a few cases of graffiti and vandalism in Hornnavík. This prompted the government to increase the police presence in the city, a move that only angered its inhabitants more. Protests against the measures started, and the local police force was deemed incapable of dealing with them. In response several members of the KP offered to loan their retinues to supplement the police.\n\nThe noble trained Huskarls were ill-fit to police the streets and their violent manner only enflamed the situation. Soon the ASS started organizing larger protests against the government, protests which soon turned into riots.  As the underclasses of Austurland saw no other way to make their displeasure known. \n\nBut amongst all the chaos, rumors have started to spread. Reports of a paramilitary organized by the ASS, and trained by Olenian expatriates.

Similar scenes were happening all over the country, as the communists made their move.\n\nBut strangely, at the head of the group stood not the leaders of the ASS, as many would have expected. Instead, the mob was lead by a group of Olenian exiles, headed by Gulrain Lisvalder. The demands of the mob were simple, Ygritte would abdicate the throne and cede all power to the newly formed NSSF. A new party formed by the merger of the ASS with Lisvaldr's Olenian exiles. \n\nThe fate of Austurland hung in the balance, and with the guns of the communists pointed at her, Yigitte's only hope was to talk them down. The communist coup would fail if she managed to wrestle popular support back from their hooves, but such a task might be beyond her."

Lisvaldr had been the leader of the communist coup that was only narrowly avoided thanks to Ygrittes personal charisma, but with tensions dissolved he quickly found himself becoming irrelevant. Both within Austurlandic society as a whole, and within the Austurlandic communist movement.\n\nThe government had no intention of punishing him or anyone else involved in the coup, they had no desire to inflame tensions. And so many are confused as to why he even decided to flee the country. Some theorize that he was simply afraid of a reprisal by the government, others that the senseless mockery from his fellow communists about failing the revolution twice grew too much for him. Whatever his reasons, it seems that Lisvaldr and his communists are no longer a threat to Austurlandic democracy."

They will use Austurlandic society and culture to corrupt the minds of the commondeer, and then crush the revolution.\n\nBut such a tragedy would not be allowed to come to pass. And the only possible response was to cleanse Austurlandic culture from all counter-revolutionary elements. To this end,  Lisvaldr has announced the start of a great proletarian cultural revolution. Every facet of Austurlandic society shall be, former reactionaries and landlords would be reeducated through rigorous self-critique. The old tales and sagas would be examined and rewritten to better fit the ideological necessities of communism.\n\nThe process would be hard, but the resolve of the proletariat was unshakable.

But the time has come for the most critical reform of the communists, fixing the Austurlandic language. \n\nThe deer in Austurland speak an almost incomprehensible dialect of Olenian, with an archaic vocabulary and a highly irregular noun morphology system. But with the enactment of the revolutionary language decree, all Austurlanders shall be taught proper Olenian, and all places and institutions renamed accordingly.\n\nLisvaldr and his comrades breathe a sigh of relief, as they are no longer forced to listen to the incomprehensible gibberish of these strange deer."

They not only record the exploits of ancient Viking warbands but also family histories and chronicles of legal debates. But with the new communist government solidifying its power, a few selective edits to these pieces of history have been made.\n\nThough technically, nodeer could say for sure whether or not Hoef Derickson's expedition was actually an attempt to flee from oppressive nobles and establish a communal society. Or that Hårald the Trotter had actually been an agent of foreign reactionaries from Olenia, who destroyed the prospering proto-socialist society that existed in Austurland and enforced thralldom upon its peaceful inhabitants. \n\nA vast government program aimed at reeducating the inhabitants of Austurland about the truth of their sagas is already underway, and in a few generations, the old versions will fade from memory completely.

True, the purges had been bloody, but what other response could he have given to the gang of thugs and slavers who had run the country before he had arrived.\n\nThe darkness of feudalism lay behind the deer of the SSR Peurojenmaa, and the future contained only industry, progress, and abundance. They had established a country dictated by reason, instead of letting the old forces of greed and fear push themselves around. The SSR was rapidly industrializing under the planned economy, and no effort was wasted on petty competition between companies.\n\nBut the work was not yet done, as foreign reactionaries were already massing their armies in an attempt to snuff out the revolution before it could spread. Their armies would assault the SSR with ferocity, but the revolutionary spirit of the Deer was unyielding. So long as he continued to guide them on the path to communism, they would be vindicated in the end."

The economy is in dire need of modernization, and greater centralization is still desperately needed within the government. \n\nAusturland will continue into the future still bound by it's past. But many griffons have met their fates after underestimating the prowess of a Viking warband.

And today most of these privileges were erased by the stroke of Ygrittes pen, as the power of the monarchy is reinforced within Austurland.\n\nThe nobility would complain, but there was nothing that they could do in response. They had agreed to all this beforehand, in exchange for maintaining a few of their more minor rights. The days of nobles openly flaunting the law, and holding up althing sessions for weeks over minor technicalities were finally at an end."

austurland.88.d:0 "With Ygritte's authority over the nobility growing, the time had come for the reform she had been anticipating the most. The standardization of titles. Previously, noble titles were granted on a somewhat ad hoc basis. Many past jarls had made up entirely new titles just to butter up their supporters, and some nobles had even embellished their titles without any approval from the Jarl at all. All of this resulted in a chaotic and complex system of differing titles that were hard to even keep track of. \n\nNo more, decreed Ygritte. She and her advisers would cut down the current mess into a few concise and clearly ranked titles. Ygritte would never again have to spend days tracking down old records just to determine who outranked who, or spend hours arguing about the legitimacy of some clearly made up rank of nobility. These reforms would also make it possible for her to elevate some of her closest supporters to minor nobility, an advantage that was not insignificant.\n\nThe nobles themselves were rather mixed about the whole ordeal. On one hoof, many now found themselves having significantly less power on paper, but on the other many nobles had grown just as exhausted with the whole system as Ygritte was. At least there was an elegance to be found in simplicity."
austurland.88.a:0 "Hopefully, that'll fix a few headaches."

austurland.89.t:0 "The New Tax Code"
austurland.89.d:0 "Another aspect of Ygrittes centralization measures is establishing a proper tax code for the country. Previously, the vast majority of Austurlands inhabitants had actually paid their taxes to some local noble, who then sent some portion of their earnings to the Jarl. The freedeer had been the only real exception to this, owing to their lack of obligation to any noble masters. \n\nThis system had worked while Austurland had been a feudal society, but with the decline of serfdom, reform is needed. Not to mention that the nobility had been notoriously reluctant to actually pay their taxes. Indeed, some nobles had even claimed that they had no obligation to pay tax at all, citing some obscure services their ancestors had rendered to a long-dead Jarl.\n\nThe old system of feudal obligations was being thrown out completely. Replaced with a proper tax on income, and in the case of the nobility, overly large estates. This change was much to the chagrin of the nobles, who suddenly found themselves actually having to pay their taxes, but there was little they could do but complain. The days of the nobility overruling the monarchy were long over."
austurland.89.a:0 "Everydeer has to pay their due."

austurland.90.t:0 "The New Anthem"
austurland.90.d:0 "With the decline of the nobility as a base of power made apparent, new ways of unifying the population around the monarchy have to be found. As a part of this process, Ygritte and her government have actively worked towards establishing a proper Austurlandic national identity, hoping that nationalism will fill the gap left by the nobility. So when a Huskarl approached the Jarl with a composition, requested that it be made the official national anthem of Austurland, her curiosity was piqued.\n\nThe anthem is titled "Dýrð Austurlands" or Austutrlands Glory and is played in D-flat major. The song accompanying the anthem emphasizes the glorious past of Austurland, telling tales of brave Vikings setting out to make their fortune across Griffonia, particularly emphasizing the role Viking warriors played in the fall of Lake City's empire. The song was met with unanimous approval from Ygrittes supporters, and the anthem was soon officially adopted. "
austurland.90.a:0 "Austurland Gloria!"

austurland.91.t:0 "A New Order"
austurland.91.d:0 "A new order dawns over Austurland. For the first time in its history, a professional military marches through its capital, observed by the Jarl. A far cry from the bands of irregular warriors they had been just a few short years ago, the Jarls Huskarls had exchanged their axes for rifles, and their armor for uniforms. Their ranks have been standardized and a clear chain of command has been established. The age of the nobles is over, and the age of the Huskarls has started.\n\nA number of former noble estates had even been bought out entirely by the government, turned into military bases from which the Huskarls patrolled the country. The military now played a far more prominent role in the minds of the common citizens of Austurland than the nobles, and many Huskarls move on to have influential political careers after retirement. \n\nSome have even started to worry that the influence of the military is growing too rapidly. They might not have possessed the arrogance of the nobility, but the government now possessed the means to force any deer in the country to comply with its demands. But for now, many are simply happy that the old nobles are gone, while hoping that their replacements do not turn into worse tyrants. "
austurland.91.a:0 "A hearty hurrah for Austurland!"

austurland.92.t:0 "The Art Of The Deal"
austurland.92.d:0 "Although the nobility was certainly a declining force within Austurland, allowing their discontent to grow would be a foolish move. And although Ygritte was not willing to grant them their ancient rights back, there are several far more material means through which she could sway them. With mechanized farming becoming more prevalent, and the abolishment of serfdom leading to many nobles losing their tax base, a large number of nobles now find themselves without a source of income.\n\nAnd if Ygritte happens to offer them a very well furnished estate in the countryside, along with monthly payments in exchange from withdrawing from politics, a great deal of them would fold. The scheme would be costly, but not overwhelmingly so. And a few chests of gold were a small price to pay for political stability. "
austurland.92.a:0 "This will keep them off our backs..."

austurland.93.t:0 "Keeping Them Busy"
austurland.93.d:0 "The end of feudalism came with many benefits for Austurland, but the process did not come without any detriments. A large portion of Austurland's population had relied on the nobility for employment and housing, and with the end of such arrangements a vast influx of poor and unskilled labor came into the cities.\n\nMany cities were almost overwhelmed in trying to deal with their new inhabitants, and a solution to the problem was desperately needed. Thus, the first real public works program in Austurlands history was introduced by Ygritte, and not a moment too soon.\n\nThe "Bæjarvinna" or city work program would employ former serfs temporarily, putting them to work constructing infrastructure and doing general maintenance work nessicary in the city. The scheme itself also aimed to better distribute the wast amount of former serfs around the country, offering to relocate the deer to cities and towns where workers were needed, and thus hopefully securing them a chance at employment after the program ended. "
austurland.93.a:0 "'Tis a nice scheme."

austurland.94.t:0 "The Lágmarkslaun"
austurland.94.d:0 "As former serfs continue to integrate into Austurlands economy, growing pains were to be expected.  But the sheer amount of low skilled labor flowing into the cities has resulted in the supply of labor far outstripping the meager demand. As a result, the income of many formers serfs has actually decreased despite the end of feudalism. As many find themselves working long hours in horrid conditions for meager pay. \n\nThis problem was further complicated by instability in prices following the end of feudalism, causing a temporary rise in the cost of bread and meat. The quickly rising cost of necessities has left many deer unable to put food on the table, and hungry citizens are ripe ground for revolutionary thought. \n\nIn ages past, this problem would have been truly impossible for the government to solve. Another weakness of the traditional impotence of Austurlands system of government. Thankfully the increased centralization over the past few years meant that this was a problem the government could solve, and soon an official minimum wage was enacted within Austurland."
austurland.94.a:0 "Hopefully this will ensure nodeer goes homeless."

austurland.95.t:0 "The Jarl's Speech"
austurland.95.d:0 "Ygritte prepared to speak to her entire nation, not off the top of a podium, but through a microphone. Her address would be broadcast across the nation, a task only recently made feasible within Austurland. Radio receivers were slowly but surely becoming a common household item, and speakers had been installed within the halls of most towns for those unable to afford a set. She did find the whole process a tad impersonal, but such thoughts were washed away as a small red light within the recording booth switched on, signaling her to start.\n\n"My subjects, I speak to you today to address a question that has come up numerous times, not just within my rule but throughout Austurland's history. Does this country need a Jarl? I do not begrudge my subjects for asking this question, and I hope you will not begrudge me for answering it. I believe that, just as you are obliged to serve me, so am I obliged to serve you. My principal task is not to waste away on some estate like the nobles of old, but to cultivate a strong and prosperous nation in cooperation with the Althing. "\n\n"If you want to see the fate of states without a proper central authority to reign dissident elements in, you need to look no further than the past of this very country. We clung to feudalism for centuries due to petty infighting, all while our neighbors modernized and increased their standards of living. If Austurland is to become a modern nation we cannot let this happen again, either through the nobility or bickering political parties, which is why a strong central authority is needed." \n\n"I hope that I have managed to convey my sincerity to you, and if not, then I ask that you give me a chance to prove myself through my actions. Thank you, and may the gods bless Austurland.""
austurland.95.a:0 "They'll fall in line... eventually."

austurland.96.t:0 "Marginalising The Old Guard"
austurland.96.d:0 "The nobility had been the traditional source of power for Austurland's Jarl, providing levies and taxes in exchange for a large degree of autonomy.  But with the end of Feudalism and the development of a professional army, their usefulness was quickly coming to an end. The nobles no longer held the keys to power in Austurland, and thus there was no reason to allow them any influence over its government. Though there was no reason to be overtly hostile about the whole ordeal, Ygritte did not need any more enemies.\n\nInstead of any overt sign of hostility, one day they would be informed that the Jarl was busy, and redirected to some inane bureaucrat who would calmly note all their demands, and then proceed to do nothing about them. The nobles would complain at first, but with their sources of income waning, their fortunes would do nothing but dwindle while this happened. The smart ones would know when to fold and retire to their estates for the rest of their estates. And those who were not so wise would find themselves powerless to affect any real change."
austurland.96.a:0 "Good."

austurland.97.t:0 "The Fate Of The Monarchy"
austurland.97.d:0 "As the nobles quickly loose whatever scraps of power they had left, and the royal police force grows by the day, none could deny that Ygritte had managed to secure her power within Austurland. But the fact was that the monarchy remained quite weak legally speaking, and Ygritte couldn't rule as an autocrat much longer without delegating some responsibilities or granting herself more formal powers. \n\nA constitution would allow her to devolve some of the more tedious aspects of rulership to a Prime minister, while still maintaining a relatively large amount of the benefits. The Althing would be allowed some degree of legislative power, though ensuring that it was staffed by loyalists would not be a hard feat. And Austurland's monarchy would take on a more liberal shade, though the acts of the government would fundamentally remain the acts of the Jarl. \n\nHowever, another option did exist. Ygritte had heard tales of a rising political movement far to the west, lead by Giulio Beakolini. Some aspects of the movement went too far for the Jarl's tastes, but there was something inherently compelling about this foreign ideology. Austurland had yet to see a truly strong Jarl, one backed by overwhelming military force and a careful application of propaganda."
austurland.97.a:0 "That Beakolini character has some applicable ideas..."
austurland.97.b:0 "Bah, let's just make a constitution and be done with it!"

austurland.98.t:0 "The Kingdom Of Hreindýraland"
austurland.98.d:0 "Austurland is in many ways a completely different nation compared to when Ygritte first ascended. Great strides in modernization have been taken, transforming Austurland from a small feudal society into a fledgling nation-state. None of this would have been possible without the strong guidance of the Jarl Ygritte. The country has in truth grown by such degrees that it was hardly proper to call it a Jarldom anymore. Austurland had turned into something greater, and it was only natural that it's ruler's title would change alongside it. \n\nThus, after a period of preparation, a grand ceremony was held within the great hall of the Jarl in Hornavík. There, Ygrittes personal Huskarl guards, along with the highest-ranking military officers of the army gathered to swear their loyalty to her anew, not as a jarl, but as a Queen. A crown set with pearls and sapphires was presented to Ygritte, who proceeded to crown herself, declaring the creation of the Kingdom of Hreindýraland shortly afterward. Celebrations were orderly but long-lived, and Ygritte herself discussed the state of the military with her generals long into the night."

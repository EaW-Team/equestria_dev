### Events ###
romau.1.t:0 "The Proclamation of the Regent"
romau.1.d:0 "Bad News. The Northern and Western states of the Empire, under the Lead of Gabriela Eagleclaw, have announced their formal secession from the Empire and declared their Independence. The Imperial Regent, unsure how to react to this development, was powerless.\n\nMore importantly, the Empire's military and economical might shrinks further. With it being cut in half, once again, many griffons inside Romau are questioning whether a continued allegiance and servitude to the Empire is beneficial or not. A continued relationship might very well result in an economic crash, they argue. Radicals have already picked up on this issue, and already there are Propaganda leaflets in the Streets antagonising the Council."
romau.1.a:0 "This does not bode well for us..."

romau.2.t:0 "The Proclamation of the Regent"
romau.2.d:0 "After a heated Debate in the Imperial Regency Council, the leaders of the Southern imperial States have declared their formal secession and independence from the Empire. The Imperial Regent, held back by the squabbling Aristocracy, decided not to act on this move. We are now under pressure from Archon Erion XII to push through, as well and declare our Independence. Due to his large influence in our politics and society, resisting his demand would be to no avail..."
romau.2.a:0 "We walk a lonely road, for now."

romau.3.t:0 "The Battle for Romau"
romau.3.d:0 "The Riots in the Street have only grown over these last few days. Multiple political movements, including Republicans and Communists, have used this opportunity to rally a large part of the population behind them. At any point, the Protesters outside the City Council could break through and seize the Senate and thus the City. In addition to this, Archon Eros XII has also commented on the situation, saying that the inability of the Council to restore Order within the City boundaries is a sign of great weakness and decadence.\n\nWith Republicans and Communists threatening to seize control, and the Archon growing impatient, the Destiny of Romau will be undeniably be decided this fateful Day."
romau.3.a:0 "The Trade Unions win the power struggle!"
romau.3.b:0 "The Romau City Council restores order!"
romau.3.c:0 "The NRP takes over the city!"
romau.3.e:0 "Archon Erion XII takes over the city!"

romau.4.t:0 "Erion's Takeover"
romau.4.d:0 "Following the inability of the Council to restore Order, the Archon himself has stepped in and taken direct control. With his help, we were able to put down the mass riots and protesters. The Council has lost the Battle, and Archon Erios now rules the City."
romau.4.a:0 "Nice going, Erion."
romau.4.b:0 "Terrible news!"

romau.5.t:0 "The Council's Decision"
romau.5.d:0 "The Council has managed to restore Order internally. However, it is undeniable that a City as small as Romau is incredibly vulnerable to outside forces if we remain without foreign Protection. Because of this, some Senators have proposed that we reverse our previous Decision and re-approach the Empire, offering them our renewed Service."
romau.5.a:0 "The Empire is dead!"
romau.5.b:0 "Maybe we should try negotiating..."

romau.6.t:0 "The State of Romau"
romau.6.d:0 "The Free City of Romau to our South has recently experienced a massive revolt, in which many political elements clashed with each other. At the end of the Day, the local Archon, Erion XII, stepped in and re-installed Order through brutal use of Force. The previous Government in the form of a City Council was abolished, and the Archon now rules the City by himself. Archon Eros has already met with him personally after this turn of events, and it appears the two of them are happy to continue mutual collaboration. Unlike some other Traitors in the Empire, Romau will remain a part of the realm."
romau.6.a:0 "Good to see Erion has it all handled."

romau.7.t:0 "The Council's Offer"
romau.7.d:0 "Despite their previous declaration of Independence, delegates of the City Council of the City of Romau have approached us and offer us their renewed Service in exchange for Protection. The Regency Council is split on the matter, as these griffons are technically Traitors of the highest Order."
romau.7.a:0 "No compromise with traitors!"
romau.7.b:0 "Welcome them back into the fold."

romau.8.t:0 "The Archons Decline"
romau.8.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, the Archons in the Imperial Council have refused our Request. They regard us as Traitors of the highest Order, and intend to treat us as such. No doubt, this does not bode well for us."
romau.8.a:0 "A storm is coming..."

romau.9.t:0 "The Archons Accept"
romau.9.d:0 "Our Envoys were able to convince the Archons in the Imperial Council of our Request. Our City was welcomed back into the fold and is to be given back its former Status of a imperial Free City."
romau.9.a:0 "Finally, some good news!"

romau.10.t:0 "Romau's Request"
romau.10.d:0 "The small City-state of Romau has approached us with a Request for Equipment and mutual Assistance. They hope to profit off of our native Research successes and Tank programs, in order to deter and threaten the Giant that is the Griffonian Empire. Should we aid our Communist brethren across the Ocean or not?"
romau.10.a:0 "Send them help."
romau.10.b:0 "They seem like revisionists..."

romau.11.t:0 "Stalliongradian Assistance"
romau.11.d:0 "A Stalliongradian message has reached us, informing us that they happily agree to our request for Support. A small Brigade of Tanks will be shipped to Romau, together with a small delegation of Scientists and Engineers. Hoorah!"
romau.11.a:0 "A toast to our Stalliongradian Comrades!"

romau.12.t:0 "Stalliongrad Declines"
romau.12.d:0 "Despite our best intentions, Stalliongrad has refused to answer our plead for Support. Can they not see and understand our Struggle?"
romau.12.a:0 "But what about worker solidarity?"

romau.13.t:0 "Romau's Request"
romau.13.d:0 "The small City State of Romau within the Empire's borders has approached us with a plead for help. They ask for weapon deliveries, as well as political cooperation to further expand the Revolution."
romau.13.a:0 "Send them help."
romau.13.b:0 "We're a bit busy at the moment!"

romau.14.t:0 "Prywhian Assistance"
romau.14.d:0 "The Leaders of the Prywhian Communist Party have agreed to our Request for Help, and will try and send us aid as soon as possible."
romau.14.a:0 "A toast to our griffon comrades!"

romau.15.t:0 "Prywhen Declines"
romau.15.d:0 "Despite our common ideological bonds, the Government of Prywhen has refused our Request for Help. We are on our own."
romau.15.a:0 "But what about worker solidarity?"

romau.16.t:0 "Romau's Request"
romau.16.d:0 "The small City State of Romau has approached us and asks for help in their struggle against the Empire. They say that they are one of the many bulwarks of Republicanism in Griffonia, and that we must stand together to eventually tear down the Imperial Monster. How do we respond?"
romau.16.a:0 "Send them help."
romau.16.b:0 "We've got our own issues."

romau.17.t:0 "Republican Assistance"
romau.17.d:0 "The Republic has agreed to our Request and has promised to send us everything we asked for."
romau.17.a:0 "I knew we could count on them!"

romau.18.t:0 "The Republic Declines"
romau.18.d:0 "Despite our Republican ties, the President-Marshal of the Republic has refused to answer our call for help. We are left on our own against the Empire and its Aristocracy."
romau.18.a:0 "So much for Pan-Griffonism..."

romau.19.t:0 "The New "Archon""
romau.19.d:0 "The Duchess, the new Imperial Regent, has somehow found it fit to proclaim that our local Archon Erion XII is illegitimate, and that the self-proclaimed Archon Haephestus should take his place as Archon of Eyr. This is, no doubt, just another move of the Duchess to instigate Trouble within the Empire. Regardless of her motives though, Erion's legitimacy was hit badly by this false Proclamation, and it will take some time for him to regain the full trust of the people of Romau as the rightful Archon of Eyr."
romau.19.a:0 "There will be consequences for this!"

romau.20.t:0 "The New Order"
romau.20.d:0 "We have claimed Griffenheim, the Imperial Capital, for ourselves. We are truly the reincarnation of the Griffonian Empire. Long live the Empire!"
romau.20.a:0 "Long live the Empire!"

romau.21.t:0 "The New Order"
romau.21.d:0 "Through the Leadership of the Archon and the divine judgement of Eyr, we have conquered the Imperial Capital of Griffenheim. A great Victory for us all!"
romau.21.a:0 "Long live the Archon!"

romau.22.t:0 "The New Order"
romau.22.d:0 "The Workers of Romau have won the Struggle against the Imperial Decadency and Corruption. Many griffons have been freed from their shackles, and yet there is still much to do. The red Flag is hoisted atop the Imperial Palace in Griffenheim, and it shall remain that way until all eternity."
romau.22.a:0 "Long live the Commune!"

romau.23.t:0 "The New Order"
romau.23.d:0 "The Republic lives, and our Dream has materialised! The Empire is dead, and in its stead the Republic moves on to govern the Griffonian Continent. All griffons shall be free!"
romau.23.a:0 "Long live the Republic!"

romau.24.t:0 "Rima Reclaimed"
romau.24.d:0 "Our Raid to reclaim the Province of Rima has been a complete success. Rima returns to the fold, and our enemies are humiliated!"
romau.24.a:0 "Welcome back!"

romau.25.t:0 "Defeat"
romau.25.d:0 "The Enemy was stronger than we expected. Our Raid on Rima was, unfortunately, a failure, and our troops have pulled back after taking considerable losses. A humiliating Defeat..."
romau.25.a:0 "We'll get them next time."

romau.26.t:0 "Attack Cancelled"
romau.26.d:0 "The Enemy was more numerous and better prepared than anticipated. After several skirmishes between our two forces, we have decided to pull back, for now. We didn't take Rima for ourselves, but at least we saved face... mostly."
romau.26.a:0 "Sadly, we were not prepared."

romau.27.t:0 "Victory"
romau.27.d:0 "Those bastards over in Romau had no chance against our brave troops! Valiantly we stood and fended them off. This is our land, and they will not take it from us!"
romau.27.a:0 "Take that!"

romau.28.t:0 "Defeat"
romau.28.d:0 "The Enemy was too strong for our troops to hold back. Despite valiant sacrifices during the numerous skirmishes on the Border, we were forced to retreat. Enemy troops quickly seized the Territory, effectively annexing it and ending our temporary hostilities."
romau.28.a:0 "Damn it!"

romau.29.t:0 "Attack Cancelled"
romau.29.d:0 "The Cowards of Romau have today called off their Raid on Rima after several clashes with our Army. It appears those fools were foolish enough to think we'd be fighting them with sticks and stones only, not rifles and Artillery."
romau.29.a:0 "That's just sad..."

romau.30.t:0 "Thurwingen Reclaimed"
romau.30.d:0 "At last, Thurwingen is ours, once more! Our troops fought hard and without break, and it was well worth it in the End. Huzzah!"
romau.30.a:0 "Welcome back!"

romau.31.t:0 "Falconia Reclaimed"
romau.31.d:0 "As the last were fired, our troops in Falconia cheered. The land of Falconia has, at last, been returned to us. Never again will we give it up!"
romau.31.a:0 "Welcome back!"

romau.32.t:0 "Romau Requests Rima"
romau.32.d:0 "Although sounding rather unusual, [From.GetName] requests that they be gifted the surrounding Territory of Rima. Seeing as how this piece of Land falls under our jurisdiction, it is up to us to decide whether we want to reward the Romauans for their loyalty or not."
romau.32.a:0 "I suppose they deserve it."
romau.32.b:0 "No."

romau.33.t:0 "Romau Requests Thurwingen"
romau.33.d:0 "[From.GetName] has sent us a formal request today, asking for us to return the land of Thurwingen to them. This is more than an odd request, but seeing as how the land is part of our Realm, we must decide on the matter at claw."
romau.33.a:0 "I suppose they deserve it."
romau.33.b:0 "No."

romau.34.t:0 "Romau Requests Falconia"
romau.34.d:0 "[From.GetLeader] of Romau has visited us in the Capital today, formally asking and even begging that we gift them with the land of Falconia to their East. This Land is part of our Realm, and so it is up to us to decide on the matter. Should we reward our loyal vassal?"
romau.34.a:0 "I suppose they deserve it."
romau.34.b:0 "No."

romau.35.t:0 "The Transfer of Rima"
romau.35.d:0 "The Imperials have decided in favour of us, today, and decided to return the province of Rima back under our Control. After a long time, Rima is ours once more, without a single bit of bloodshed."
romau.35.a:0 "Great!"

romau.36.t:0 "The Transfer of Thurwingen"
romau.36.d:0 "The Empire has seen our reason in the request of Thurwingen, and has thus concluded that we be gifted Control over it. Thurwingen rightfully returns to the fold!"
romau.36.a:0 "Great!"

romau.37.t:0 "The Transfer of Falconia"
romau.37.d:0 "Griffenheim has shown us their gratitude for continued servitude, and they have awarded us control over the Province of Falconia. Happy day!"
romau.37.a:0 "Great!"

romau.38.t:0 "The Empire Refuses"
romau.38.d:0 "Our Request has been 'politely declined' by the Imperials. This is most disappointing, and might indicate a lack of trust and gratitude from the Imperials."
romau.38.a:0 "I'm sure they'll accept next time..."

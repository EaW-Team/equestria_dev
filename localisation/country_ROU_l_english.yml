ROU_army_1:0 "Maintain The Legionaires"
ROU_army_1_desc:0 "The Legionaries must be maintained as a legitimate fighting force, and Romau must become a professional, elite army, unparalleled by the nations of Griffonia.

ROU_legion_1_desc:0 "The weak city militias do not define great Romau! The legions, the centerpiece of old Griffonian military tactics, shall be enshrined as our new military force. Eventually, our militas will be phased out, and only the strong will stand as protectors of Romau."
ROU_legion_2:0 "The Strength of Romau"
ROU_legion_2_desc:0 "Arantigos the Great was the conquerer who founded Romau and conquered most of the Heartlands with his might. We must build our army to be strong like Arantigos, and like his small nation of Arantiga, to stand as a bastion of professionalism and elite tactics."

ROU_fight_for_romau:0 "The Battle for Romau"
ROU_fight_for_romau_desc:0 "The riots have grown in size over the last couple of days.

ROU_the_commune:0 "Hoist the Red Flag"

ROU_remodel_the_palace_desc:0 "It is time to consider a materialist view of the history of Romau, one that looks not at the vicious Arantigan despots or corrupt capitalistic industrialists, but the common griffon of Romau, and their struggle throughout the ages. As we move to eradicate class from every aspect of Romauan life, it is clear that we must reject the old decadent, aristocratic cultures of a bygone era."
ROU_union_armouries:0 "Militarised Trade Unions"
ROU_union_armouries_desc:0 "We wish to transform our fair city into a socialist utopia, where every worker receives according to their need and contributes according to their ability.

ROU_unions_take_over_factories:0 "Factories for the Workers"
ROU_unions_take_over_factories_desc:0 "What right does the capitalist have to the machines and tools of the factories?

ROU_union_militias:0 "Union Militias"
ROU_union_militias_desc:0 "To defend their rights and freedom from oppression, every worker must arm themselves to defend what is right. Only then will the Revolution live on. Trade unions will be allowed to form their own personal armies, composed of members loyal to our revolutionary cause."

ROU_romau_tuc:0 "Create the RTUC"
ROU_romau_tuc_desc:0 "The Trade Unions were once disunited, shattered, easy prey for the Archon and the Senate. But no more shall that happen.

If we cannot do it openly, then we need to run below, sending volunteers around the world to fight in the most glorious battle of all. The battles for liberation."
ROU_necessary_republican_cooperation:0 "Pact With the NRP"
ROU_necessary_republican_cooperation_desc:0 "We may not necessarily like Kemerskai for his opinions on the socialists. We do not need to like him. But rather his Republicans than the craven senators and the Archonate in the city. But the fact remains that they are powerful force in the city and, if not necessary in the future, they are necessary now. We must form an alliance with them to cement our own position."
ROU_industrial_democracy:0 "Workers' Self Management"
ROU_industrial_democracy_desc:0 "With the oligarchs and the capitalists chased out, who better to run the factories than those that toil in them day and night?

ROU_revive_kemerskaian_welfare:0 "Revive Kemerskaian Welfare"
ROU_revive_kemerskaian_welfare_desc:0 "Since 978, the oligarchs have stripped away the protections for the worker. But they are wrong in their outlook. The commongriff must be cared for by the state and the people lest that they suffer and turn to a nasty piece of ideology or charlatan such as an Erion or an Eros. For this, we must make sure that anygriff can be sure of a chicken in their pot, four walls and a roof."

ROU_seize_oligarchy_holdings_desc:0 "The Oligarchy have grown fat off the sweat of the commmongriffs, hoarding vast amounts of wealth for no purpose other than to show it off for their craven friends.

ROU_new_education_desc:0 "As tyranny descends on the Heartlands once more, we must open the gates for all those minds that flee persecution in their homes. The brains of the Herzland shall be brought together in Romau so that they will be able to think freely, without fearing duke or dictator."

ROU_the_new_romau_council_desc:0 "The Council has been a sham, a front, a sorry excuse for true democracy, being filled with all those wreckers and oligarchs. But no more. Now the council shall be a true legislature of the people, by the people and for the people."
ROU_capitalist_traditions:0 "The Free-Market Economy"
ROU_capitalist_traditions_desc:0 "Now, that we have levelled the unions and secured our backs, it is time to roll out our changes. Regulations and labor protections do not fit in a true free market. And protectionism, that despised economic policy must go. And then, we will have made our Romau."

ROU_southern_heartland_republic:0 "To The South"
ROU_southern_heartland_republic_desc:0 "To the South lies Katerin, Angriver and Yale. All proved themselves unworthy as soon as they decided to oppose the old Republic in 978. They shall be integrated directly into the Republic, to avoid the unruly autonomies that plagued the Emperor."

ROU_join_up_with_the_marshal_desc:0 "Marshal Kemerskai is waiting for us in the North, as he has been for 30 years.

ROU_continue_the_revolution:0 "Continue The Revolution"
ROU_continue_the_revolution_desc:0 "The Republic is dead, and in its place only lies vicious warlords, socialist traitors, and monarchist counter-revolutionaries. This cannot stand.

ROU_anti_revisionist_manifesto:0 "Anti-Revisionist Republicanism"
ROU_anti_revisionist_manifesto_desc:0 "The Republic faces too many threats from those who wish to bend its ideology to their own twisted views and circumstances.

ROU_liberty_not_order:0 "Not Authority, But Liberty"
ROU_liberty_not_order_desc:0 "A true republic does not force itself upon the citizens. Rather, it lets them live their life and inspire consent in them.

ROU_bring_back_the_generals:0 "Bring Back The Generals"
ROU_bring_back_the_generals_desc:0 "Our Republic is strong but everygriff counts. Since the failure of Kemerskai in Cloudbury, many great revolutionary generals stand idle.

ROU_in_defense_of_the_dream:0 "Soldaten Ohne Grenzen"
ROU_in_defense_of_the_dream_desc:0 "The Tricolour flies over Griffenheim indeed but many reactionary and tyrannical forces still roam this world. To secure our safety, we will call up any willing republicans throughout the world to come and fight for the ideal of liberty, prosperity and democracy!"

ROU_democracy_on_a_global_stage_desc:0 "For centuries, the world evolved in a state of chaos and imperialism.

ROU_prosperity_not_socialism:0 "Not Equality, But Prosperity"
ROU_prosperity_not_socialism_desc:0 "The old nobles called for monopolized wealth while extremists scream for enforced equality. Rather, we would have an equality of opportunity.

ROU_the_return_of_the_unions:0 "The Return Of The Unions"
ROU_the_return_of_the_unions_desc:0 "Labor Unions have long been treated like common bandits under the old regime. Rather, we would see in them a fundamental building block of democracy. They are no different than political parties, merely another side of the same coin."
ROU_help_those_who_cannot_help_themselves:0 "Help The Helpless"
ROU_help_those_who_cannot_help_themselves_desc:0 "The Republic cannot be stable if many of its citizens remain stuck in a cycle of desperation and misery. By instituting a safety net for all citizens, we can make sure that all can get a fair chance at success. And once they are back on their paws, it is up to them to succeed."
ROU_continue_the_bunker_craze:0 "Festung Herzland"
ROU_continue_the_bunker_craze_desc:0 "Romau was made able to withstand the Groverian onslaught by forcing the enemy to fight inch by bloody inch.

ROU_bunkers_into_shops:0 "Bunkers Into Homes"
ROU_bunkers_into_shops_desc:0 "By making a fortress out of Romau, we have taken the chance to make a fortress of our minds. And all fortresses crumble eventually.

ROU_democracy_not_monarchy:0 "Not Hierarchy, But Democracy"
ROU_democracy_not_monarchy_desc:0 "The old order sought to carve in our minds the idea that all have a place in life. But now, the Tricolour flies high as our rebuttal to such idiocy.

ROU_exile_the_heir:0 "A Ship Across The Ocean"
ROU_exile_the_heir_desc:0 "There is no place in our Republic for the living embodiment of the old regime and so there is no other option but exile for he who claims to rule us all. Grover the so-called Sixth ought to be sent in a place where he can no longer be a threat to the republic."
ROU_convince_the_monarchists:0 "Convince The Groverites"
ROU_convince_the_monarchists_desc:0 "One of the main tenet of republicanism is the idea that our birth does not define our place in society nor does it our political opinions. As many remain stuck in nostalgia for the old days, perhaps it is time to give them all a case study."
ROU_crush_resistance_cells:0 "Crush Resistance Cells"
ROU_crush_resistance_cells_desc:0 "Throughout the Herzlands, some diehards continue to fight and terrorize the citizenry. They shan't win of course but as long as they breath, they will cause hardship for many of our compatriots. They will learn that the war is over with a bullet if need be."
ROU_seize_their_gains:0 "Seize Their Ill-Gotten Gains"
ROU_seize_their_gains_desc:0 "Just like in Romau, imperial loyalists and corrupt nobility continue to hold control over large swaths of our economy. We cannot hope to build a citizen's economy if their oppressors remain our masters. If they want to climb back on top, they will have to earn it!"
ROU_liberate_the_north:0 "The Cloudbury Restoration"
ROU_liberate_the_north_desc:0 "In the end, hope was reborn in Romau rather than Cloudbury. The Republic in the north has failed but the Dream still keeps on going in the Herzlands. Let us march once again to Cloudbury, this time not as defeated refugees but as the victorious army of democracy!"

ROU_REP_the_oil_fields:0 "Oil Fields In Adelart"
ROU_REP_the_oil_fields_desc:0 "The Greifwaldian oil fields are a valuable asset, but the wells currently in place are obsolescent, and extraction could be greatly improved. The potential strategic value of these reserves can not be overstated."

ROU_REP_core_west:0 "Core The West"

The Imperial Regent, unsure how to react to this development, was powerless.\n\nMore importantly, the Empire's military and economical might shrinks further. With it being cut in half, once again, many griffons inside Romau are questioning whether a continued allegiance and servitude to the Empire is beneficial or not. A continued relationship might very well result in an economic crash, they argue. Radicals have already picked up on this issue, and already there are propaganda leaflets in the streets antagonising the Council."

The Imperial Regent, held back by the squabbling aristocracy, decided not to act on this move. We are now under pressure from Archon Erion XII to push through, as well and declare our independence. Due to his large influence in our politics and society, resisting his demand would be to no avail..."

Multiple political movements, including Republicans and Communists, have used this opportunity to rally a large part of the population behind them. At any point, the Protesters outside the City Council could break through and seize the Senate and thus the City. In addition to this, Archon Erion XII has also commented on the situation, saying that the inability of the Council to restore Order within the City boundaries is a sign of great weakness and decadence.\n\nWith Republicans and Communists threatening to seize control, and the Archon growing impatient, the Destiny of Romau will be undeniably be decided this fateful Day."

romau.4.d:0 "Following the inability of the Romau City Council to restore order, the Archon himself has stepped in and taken direct control, supported by religious fanatics and loyal Eyrite knights. With his help, the Romuan authorities were able to put down the mass riots and protesters. To ensure that peace and stability remains, Archon Erion has disbanded the Senate and formed a government of his own, which he promises to be temporary, albeit few believe him. The Council has lost the battle, and Archon Erion now rules the City of Romau."

romau.5.t:0 "The Council's Decision"
romau.5.d:0 "The Council has finally managed to restore order internally. However, it is undeniable that a City as small as Romau is incredibly vulnerable to outside forces if we remain without foreign protection.

At the end of the day, the local Archon, Erion XII, stepped in and re-installed order through brutal use of force. The previous government in the form of a City Council was abolished, and the Archon now rules the city by himself. Archon Eros VII has already met with him personally after this turn of events, and it appears the two of them are happy to continue mutual collaboration. Unlike some other traitors in the Empire, Romau will remain a part of the realm."

On the other claw, Romau is one of the most developed and populated cities in the Heartlands."

romau.9.t:0 "The Archons Accept"

romau.19.t:0 "The New "Archon""
romau.19.d:0 "The Duchess, the new Imperial Regent, has somehow found it fit to proclaim that our local Archon Erion XII is illegitimate, and that the self-proclaimed Archon Haephestus should take his place as Archon of Eyr. This is, no doubt, just another move of the Duchess to instigate trouble within the Empire. Regardless of her motives though, Erion's legitimacy was hit badly by this false proclamation, and it will take some time for him to regain the full trust of the people of Romau as the rightful Archon of Eyr."

romau.28.t:0 "Defeat"
romau.28.d:0 "The enemy was too strong for our troops to hold back. Despite valiant sacrifices during the numerous skirmishes on the border, we were forced to retreat. Enemy troops quickly seized the Territory, effectively annexing it and ending our temporary hostilities."

romau.29.t:0 "Attack Cancelled"

romau.31.a:0 "Welcome back!"

romau.32.t:0 "Romau Requests Rima"

romau.33.b:0 "Request declined."

romau.34.t:0 "Romau Requests Falconia"
romau.34.d:0 "[From.GetLeader] of Romau has visited us in the capital today, formally asking and even begging that we gift them with the land of Falconia to their east. This land is part of our realm, and so it is up to us to decide on the matter. Should we reward our loyal vassal?"

romau.39.t:0 "The First Congress of the Griffonian Workers"
romau.39.d:0 "After a period of reform, the Commune had finally created foundations upon which a true socialist utopia could be built. However, the exact form of this utopia remained disputed. As much as Ehrhardt wanted to create a true syndicalist Herzland with his comrades, he did not want to impose his will on others who held different values.\n\nSo the Congress was held in Griffenheim, with elected representatives from all corners of Herzland gathering to elect a Chairgriffon and decide which party would guide the Commune to a brighter future. Two candidates proved to be popular choices, their arguments solid and reasonable: Hero of the revolution Roland Ehrhardt and Angriverian intellectual and anarchist resistance leader Willie Scherler. Both of them had quite different values and the arguments between them got heated at times, but ultimately both of them valued democracy above all and allowed the people to make the final decision."
romau.39.a:0 "Ehrhardt shall lead us!"
romau.39.b:0 "Scherler shall represent the workers!"

romau.40.t:0 "An End To The Syndies"
romau.40.d:0 "At exactly dawn today, the Romau Council declared a complete state of emergency in the city - it would not be lifted, they said, until the godless and traitorous socialist rebels were rooted out of every corner and cranny of the city. The vote was passed unanimously, with even the liberals among them agreeing that the labour movement had gone too far.\n\nRoland Ehrhardt, the leader of the Romau Gewerkschaften and his supporters took the council's decision as a declaration of war, and soon, their general strikes and rioting erupted into anarchy. In the hours after the council's decision, strikers and union members had seized thousands of idols of wealth from brave Romauan aristocrats and occupied three temples across the city.\n\nDespite their fortified positions and numbers, however, Ehrhardt's group stood no chance against the legions of Romau, who battled with thousands of enraged industrial workers across the city. The Grand Temple of Eyr was quickly defended by thousands of Romauan policemen, who took the temple "for Erion and the Gods".\n\nAfter the carnage had settled, the socialists had been driven back from their key positions across Romau, and the strikes had come to an end. The Senate, quick to negotiate with remaining labour movements, exclaimed that the "good and loyal unions had nothing to fear", and pardoned hundreds of small social-democratic leaders who had been caught up in the struggle. Ehrhardt, however, was no-where to be found. Legends sprung up that he had killed Romauan legions with only a rifle and escaped the city, leaving a trail of corpses behind him, and others suggest that he hijacked a passenger plane to Angriver, while the Senate claims he was among the corpses in the streets.\n\nWhile the radical syndicalist unions have been crushed, it seems Ehrhardt may still be out there..."
romau.40.a:0 "Perhaps we will burn Ehrhardt like he did all those temples..."


romau.41.t:0 "A Meeting With Grover VI"
romau.41.d:0 "His majesty, Emperor Grover VI, was escorted to his throne room by Romauan soldiers. There, Erion was waiting for him, sitting on the Imperial Throne, gazing down upon the young griff. The Emperor was certainly not happy to see him there, but at this point it was merely a yet another act of arrogant treason among many.\n"Why have you brought me here?" Grover asked, glaring at the Archon. Erion stood up and clasped his claws. "Because I wanted to talk to you, of course. About the future of the Empire and your role as its ruler."\n"And what do you want, snake?"\nErion walked down the steps from the throne's pedestal. "I have no intention to claim the crown for myself, and not just because I have no claim to it. No, I would be content with acting as your sole regent, with Eros and Proteus out of the picture. You would get to remain Emperor while I rule the nation."\n"Why would I make such a deal with you? You haven't proven to be trustworthy in the slightest so far."\nThe Archon shrugged. "It's not like you have much choice."\nGrover frowned, and thought of his father, who had been a mere miserable puppet of his regents instead of a true Emperor. Would he now share his ill fate?\n"When I come of age, will you let me rule my nation?"\n"We shall see," Erion said and grinned. "We shall see. If you behave well, perhaps I will consider doing so." He stepped aside and motioned to the throne. "Your majesty, your throne is vacant. Will you not sit down on it?"\nGrover gulped and breathed deeply. This was a deal with Maar, but the only deal he could make. Refusing it was certain death -- or worse.\n"V-very well.""
romau.41.a:0 "He shall have his old throne, that much is sure"

romau.42.t:0 "An Unforeseen Event"
romau.42.d:0 "Archon Eros never trusted Erion, and he trusted him even less now that he was in control of Griffenheim and had a loyal army supporting him. The feeling was mutual, and soon after the victory both sides began to conspire against one another. Eros was one step ahead almost every time, but Erion was younger, and his cunning mind hadn't been dulled by old age.\n\nThis morning, the Empire was in shock as the news spread: Eros had been found dead in his bed. The doctors who examined his body concluded that he had died of a stroke, caused by his extremely high age. Erion breathed a sigh of relief and clasped his claws. No one suspected a thing and his plan had worked perfectly. Now he no longer had a rival to worry about."
romau.42.a:0 "Rest in peace, brave warrior of Boreas."

romau.43.t:0 "Proteus Sent Off"
romau.43.d:0 "After Erion had seized Griffenheim, Proteus celebrated his triumph and congratulated him. But the Archon of Eyr was too paranoid to trust even him, a warrior who always kept his word, and wanted to share power with no one. So today he summoned Proteus to meet him in person, for he had a vital task that needed to be done.\n\nErion told the warrior-Archon that he had to travel north, past the Whitetail Mountains into the mysterious lands of the Arcturian Order. There were rumours that the Order was under attack and needed any help it could get, and Proteus would deliver it.\n\nWhile the Archon of Arcturius was not so foolish as to not realize this was a trick to get him out of the capital, he knew it was best to accept this mission rather than refuse, if he still wanted to live. Reluctantly, he accepted this task and prepared for a long journey to the frigid north, hoping he would one day come back alive."

romau.44.d:0 "[Root.GetLeader] has convened the leading figures of the city to decide about the future of Romau's small military force. For centuries now, the traditional Legions had guarded the city, ever since the glory days of the past when Romau ruled a proper nation instead of being a mere city-state. However, the doctrine and organization of the legions had grown increasingly outdated over the years, meaning urgent reform was necessary, especially as tensions began to grew in Herzland.\n\nEither the legions would remain in place as before but be reformed into modern fighting units, or they would be replaced entirely with new citizen guard, comprised of fresh soldiers trained from the start with modern warfare in mind. A fierce debate began as conservatives wished to maintain the legions while reformists wished for a wider overhaul of Romau's fledgeling military. In the end, one side prevailed over the other."

But there were those that resisted, those brave soldiers, that Boreas has called to his mercy. But we must also face the facts, that many griffons here did not resist Dawnclaw, rather they used the time to go to war against each other. The nobles and the Archon, all squabbling when they should have united to save the Empire from the traitor. It fell to the Free City, that smallest of powers in the Herzland to unite the banners to kick out Dawnclaw.\n\nSo now, we must look to the future. We must renovate the entire system so that another Dawnclaw will never rise again. We must, if necessary tear it all down and rebuild the rotten system so that we may restore order and proper governance to the Heartlands, whatever it may take, for however long it may require to create working government that will not allow dictators, coupists and usurpers to create their twisted version of the Heartlands.""

And all that fell onto the old griffon. \n\n"Goodness, Senator. Another late night?" One of his associates asked as she entered his office.\n\nRavioli looked up from his papers "It's been too long that we have lived under no bigger principles than 'because the Emperor says so'."\n\nThe aide walked closer to Ravioli, peering over his head. "What are they then? Those principles?" Ravioli sighed a bit as he lifted up the paper, holding it up to the chandelier above them.\n\n"First, the government must be accountable. We must have a check so that no one can usurp power again. Secondly, we must create a government where power is spread to the many, feeding into the first principle. And thirdly, we must, to uphold this, expand the Stadtrat." Ravioli explained, as his claw pointed to several places in the text.\n\nThe aide paced around a bit. "And what about the Grovers and the Archon?"\n\nRavioli sat back down again, putting pen to paper once more. "I'll cross that bridge when I get to that. Hopefully I won't need to do so.""

Studying the painting, you can see the exquisite work that was put into it, expensive colors adorning the canvas, and all three griffons standing together in a pose of unity.\n\nChiaroscuro highlights the three, with the vanishing points behind all three griffons. But it is also clear to see where the artist put their own spin in. Gabriella can be seen to wear the Raedewetter Emerald, symbolic of envy and desire, while the Archon is dressed in the Journey Robe, both used for travels, but also for funerals.\n\nClearly, even if the antagonism has been expelled from public view, there are still many more battles to be fought in the Serene Republic."

Grover had asked for a small festival for his friends and family, but Erion defied him, refusing to invite the exiled Duchess Gabriela or Grover's favorite uncle, Edmure Eagleclaw. Instead, the regent had declared that an extravagant ball and feast would be held in Griffenheim, inviting hundreds of noble lackeys and "religious" griffons who spent most of their time engaging in lust and gluttony, while Grover sat quietly on the small throne next to Erion's grand one.\n\nErion woke up, drooling, dark circles under his widening eyes. "What is it, child?!" Erion yawned, "Yes, it was your birthday yesterday, and a damn good one, as far as I'm concerned! I told you, if you have minor troubles over any proceedings at court to bring them to the servants, not your regent!"\n\nGrover narrowed his eyes. "My coronation ceremony, Erion. When will it begin? I was told by my previous regent that I would become the Emperor of all Griffons upon my 18th birthday, but the proceedings for my coronation have been sorely lacking."\n\nA look of disgust appeared on Erion's face, slowly vanishing into a father's smile. "My child," Erion said soothingly, "You are not ready to become Emperor, just as your father was when he was your age. You should leave capable matters to your regent and your councillors - I am sure they will find just the right time to bestow upon you your ancestral birthright."\n\n"But, Erion, those at court have agreed, I am ready and should be crowned-" Grover was cut off by another chastising from Erion.\n\n"The matter is closed." the regent said, beginning to regain his mobility and move out of the throne room, wine stains upon his priestly robes, "You will do as I say, or I will order your servants to beat you again, or else you will grow up to be even more of a spoiled brat, and never - NEVER achieve your birthright."\n\n"Are we clear?""

Benito had raged about it but Grover was happy about it.

He was told to wait in front of the door while the chambermaid entered the room. She quickly came back and told him that "lady Gabriella" would see him now. Gabriella? Auntie? His heart race. She hadn't abandoned him after all! He rushed inside, only to see a blue griffonness sipping tea over a breakfast table. No Auntie. Of course, why did he think otherwise. The stranger put on a large smile and invited him to come close: "Ah. He's here. Wonderful. Do sit, my child."\n\nAs he obeyed, the griffoness served him a cup of tea while the chambermaid put toast and eggs in front of him.

I like reading? History books mostly."\n\nGabriella smiled: "Well then. Maybe we can do something about that once we get to your new home. I would be proud to have a historian as a son. Would you care for some more tea?"\n\nGrover simply answered yes."

romau.51.t:0 "An Invitation From Griffenheim"
romau.51.d:0 "The Republican regime in Griffenheim has invited us to a newly created international court of justice led by the Romauan Gabriella d'Karthin, who has taken up the mantle of leader of the Griffonian Republic.\n\nThe terms of the court of justice include general pacifist politics, racial harmony, and prevention of war crimes with the delegitimization of certain tactics, including the use of tactical poison gas and slaves as unpaid soldiers. Although Gabriella d'Karthin has promised not to let anti-monarchist bias interfere with the court of justice, many are fearful of what her new regime could lead to, and if this court is simply a ploy for the Republic to achieve more and more power.\n\nHowever, the terms themselves don't seem that bad..."
romau.51.a:0 "Of course!"
romau.51.b:0 "Seems like an infringement upon our sovereignty."

romau.52.t:0 "Off To The Polls"
romau.52.d:0 "With the renouncement of Gabriella's presidential position and new elections being conducted throughout the Griffonian Republic, two major candidates have come forth from the Herzland to let their voices be heard on the international stage.\n\nArchibald Dawnfeather, a proponent of democratic governance in Griefenmarschen and staunch supporter of Equestria has taken a stand as the candidate of the center, under the Griffonian Social Harmonist Party. Promoting a welfare state along with traditional Griffonian religious values, Dawnfeather has recieved support from a wide variety of groups across the continent, and his agrarian philosophies have led rural, traditionalist griffons to become the bulk of his campaign.\n\nIn contrast to Dawnfeather's traditionalist populism has come the Konservative Volksallianz, led by Brozehill diamond dog and conservative stalwart Winston Copperhill. A proponent of democratic reforms in the monarchy of escaped slaves, Copperhill has come under fire for his constitutional monarchism, but has remained a powerful candidate of conservative Herzlanders, wealthy industrialists, and apolitical griffons, who see his rugged, bullish persona as one of a true leader.\n\nInterestingly enough, Gabriella d'Karthin of Griffonian's National Republican Party has decided to run again for the office of President of the Griffonian Republic, under the banner of civic nationalism, pro-labour reforms, and progressive policy. Although her approval ratings among pacifists are low, and the rally-round-the-flag effect during the liberation wars has largely faded, many believe that her newfound candidacy will lead to d'Karthin staying in power for many more years."
romau.52.c:0 "Gabriella d'Karthin and the NRP!"
romau.52.a:0 "Archibald Dawnfeather and the GSHP!"
romau.52.b:0 "Winston Copperhill and the KV!"

###Descriptions###
ERHARDT_DESC:0 "When describing Roland Ehrhardt, the first word that comes to mind is radical. De-facto leader of the Romauan labour movement, Ehrhardt has made his mark on Romau in more ways than one. He has led hundreds of strikes, narrowly avoided tens of assassinations by the Romau Council, and even burned down a few temples or two in his crusade against the Archonate, the Empire, and those who would harm the workers of Romau.\n\nEhrhardt was born in 961, in a position very similiar to most Romauans - while the senate spent lavishly and fought amongst themselves, he grew up in relative poverty. His slum's position close to a sprawling temple of Eyr fueled his religious animosity, and when they continually drove back demanding charity, he began to doubt the Gods' grace entirely. His mother and father both participated in the labour movement, and Roland soon joined them in a craftworker's union at the age of 16. He rose the ranks of the union, rising from worker to organizer, and when the Republican revolution began, he joined his fellow workers in a mass general strike.\n\nAlthough the Romauan revolution, and inevitably, the Republican revolution itself, failed, Ehrhardt continued organizing, eventually outranking his own parents and becoming the appointed representative of his union in 997.\n\nEhrhardt petitioned the council numerous times for rights, and when they refused, he organized strike after strike until his workers got what they wanted. His childhood animosity toward the Eyrians culminated in a violent anti-religious campaign, and Ehrhardt and thousands of other workers participated in burnings of Romau temples in protest of the corrupt Archon, Erion.\n\nNow Ehrhardt is leader of all trade unions in Romau, and his animosity towards the Eyrians and the Council has reached a boiling point."
GABRIELLA_DESC:0 "10 years ago, if you told someone that a Wingbardian griffon would be ruling revolutionary Romau, they would laugh at you. However, now, this unlikely scenario is now a reality, and Gabriella di Karthin has taken up the mantle of the leader of one of the richest cities in Griffonia under the orange and yellow tricolour of the National Republican Party.\n\nGabriella di Karthin was born in 974, the illegitimate daughter of a Wingbardian noble who never revealed himself to her, and for that, she was given the surname of shame - "di Karthin". She was of Karthin, not of any noble house, and while her unknown father arranged for her to have a fairly prosperous upbringing, she still felt the stain of illegitimacy and the eyes of judging griffons on her at all times.\n\nLooking to make a name for herself, Gabriella traveled to one of the fastest-growing cities in Griffonia, Romau. There, she quickly rose in power, and while she still wore her Wingbardian jewels, she became a Romauan in heart. Beloved by the commonfolk for her beauty and sympathy for the common griffon, she became a Senator, and soon decided to bear the banner of the National Republican Party.\n\nAlthough the senate was originally hostile to her republicanism, they soon realized that having a republican in the Senate would do wonders for common perception of the what the commoners called the "corrupt council", and allowed her to join their ranks with open arms.\n\nBy 1007, Gabriella had become one of the most influential and popular senators, and while for now, she still obeys the democratic process, if ever there was to be a Republican revolution in Romau, it is likely she would join their banner - perhaps even lead them."
RAVIOLI_DESC:0 "15 years can very much change a griffon - and a whole city, for that matter. Senator Jules Michel Ravioli came to power in 992, and since then, Romau has been restored to its rightful place.\n\nBorn in 935 ALB to a Wingbardian immigrant and a Romau noblegriff, Jules Ravioli is perhaps one of the oldest world leaders on the Griffonian continent. For his 72 years of his life, 49 of those have been spent in the Romau councils and senate, under independent political alignment. Ravioli was a senator during the ascension of Grover V, the Republican Revolution, and the Springtime of Nations during the 980s. Ravioli has run for Senator of all Romau numerous times, but it was not until 992 ALB that he finally achieved the position he had worked so hard to achieve.\n\n991 ALB marked the climax of Romauan political conflicts, with 5 Senators coming to power during that year - 3 were assassinated, 1 was murdered by unionists during a particulary violent riot, and another committed suicide. In January of 992, Ravioli was unanimously elected by the Senate, except for one griffon who voted for Roland Ehrhardt and was assassinated the next day. Like his 5 predecessors, Ravioli was expected to die, but instead, he thrived, and Romau has again regained its position as one of the richest and most prosperous cities in Griffonia.\n\nHowever, with Ravioli growing older and older, and Emperor Grover V growing even more sickly, it is likely major political turmoil could occur once again in Romau.\n\nWill Ravioli be able to brave the storm? Or will he fall, along with the Council, the Senate, and Romauan tradition?"
ERION_DESC:0 "Youngest of the three Archons, born in 959, Erion has risen rapidly through the ranks of the Eyrite Temple to the very top. However, this was not achieved by exceptional piety alone, nor by hard and honest work. Erion is ever hungry for more power and is not afraid to use more questionable and violent means to gain it. Now that he has achieved supremacy in the Archonate of Eyr itself, he seeks to grow his temporal power as well.\n\nAll this has made Erion rather unpopular among the nobility and the clergy, who see him as a threat and a lunatic. The hatred is mutual, as Erion often rants about the corruption of the nobles of Griffonia and the senators of Romau, and the incompetence and lack of zealotry of the priesthood. Many commoners are swayed by his fiery and passionate speeches, especially among the lower classes. Erion's control of education contributes to this as young students are indoctrinated and turned into faithful servants of Eyr.\n\nWhile Erion is power-hungry, none can deny he is a devout Eyrite as well. His parents, poor industrial workers in Romau, were very religious and conservative, and sent all their children to a temple school. There, the eyes of their youngest child, Lorenz Whitefeather, were opened and he became a faithful servant of Eyr, the goddess of fertility and family. After becoming an Archon, Lorenz chose the archonal name of Erion. Even to this day, Erion sends money to his old parents, and preaches the importance of traditional values.\n\nErion has a tenuous relationship with his fellow Archons of the Borean and Arcturian temples. As Eros is one of the most influential griffons in Heartlands, Erion always seeks to impress him and earn his favour, so Eros would entrust him with more power. Eros sees through his act, however, but sees him as a useful if dangerous pawn. Proteus on the other claw openly distrusts and dislikes Erion, and Erion despises him in return for his lack of piety and neglect of clerical duty. The two only work together because they must.\n\nNow that Erion has secured his control of Romau like he always desired, he is determined to support Eros and gain rewards from him in return. However, the time might come when Erion will have outlived his usefulness to the Archon of Boreas..."

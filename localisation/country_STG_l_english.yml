stalliongrad_news.110.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]In a textbook case of the Stalliongrad military doctrine the original breakaway nation from Equestria has deployed their military to the south and into the territory of the newly formed Lunar Empire. What positions Nightmare Moon's military were able to hastily erect in the chaos of the ongoing civil war were quickly swept away, troops fleeing in their wake. Nightmare Moon was unable to be reached for comment, but Gensec [STG.GetLeader] was quoted as saying that the morning's events were a natural consequence of Equestrian alicorncracy. Despite both sides saying that they did not wish to escalate the conflict at the current time it's undoubtable that this will lead to conflicts in the future."

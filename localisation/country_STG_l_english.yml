### EVENTS #####
stalliongrad.0.t:0 "Home of the Revolution"
stalliongrad.0.d:0 "More than a decade ago, the great revolutionary named Steel Stallion sparked a revolt in the city of Stalliongrad, one of the poorest regions in Equestria. They dreamed of forming a country with a completely new economic and social system, where everypony is given equal opportunity, where everypony receives everything according to their needs. The revolt spread like wildfire and received support from the surrounding cities and villages. Equestrian officials were sent to quell the rebellion when the independence of the Republic of Stalliongrad was announced. The Equestrian army command could not tolerate it and, in several hours, the Equestrian Royal Army entered the territory of the young republic. The war continued for less than a week before Princess Celestia personally ordered her troops to stop their advance. Several generals were fired from their posts for their aggressive actions. With hopes of a brighter future, the determined ponies of Stalliongrad continue their struggle."
stalliongrad.0.a:0 "Never forget."
stalliongrad.1.t:0 "Alliance with Equestria"
stalliongrad.1.d:0 "[EQS.GetLeader] called directly to [STG.GetLeader] and asked Stalliongrad to join the bloody war against the Changeling Empire."
stalliongrad.1.a:0 "We cannot let equestrians become a meal for the changeling Queen"
stalliongrad.1.b:0 "We cannot spare resources for this war"
stalliongrad.5.t:0 "Civil War in Equestria - an Opportunity"
stalliongrad.5.d:0 "Equestrian Civil War has begun. We have a chance to get our territories back when they are weak."
stalliongrad.5.a:0 "We should consider this possibility."
stg_annexes_cores_civil_war:0 "Become owner and controller of all of §Y[Root.GetName]'s cores§! held by §Y[NLR.GetName]§!.\n"
stalliongrad.12.t:0 "The Time of Troubles"
stalliongrad.12.d:0 "After more than a decade since the establishment of the Republic of Stalliongrad, the future of it has been covered in mist of disputes, political and social stagnation. Promises of better life are not becoming reality. However the masses are not discouraged yet and if we manage to choose the right path, reform the government, finish industrialisation and end the food shortage problem, we can rely on our people to support us in every move."
stalliongrad.12.a:0 "Horosho."
stalliongrad.13.t:0 "Party Disagreements"
stalliongrad.13.d:0 "When the revolution succeeded, the Stalliongradian Communist Party took control of the state in their hooves. For most of that time, the highest positions in the party have been occupied by Altidiya Revoltsova and Vasiliy Pantsushenko, two earthponies, under whose leadership Stalliongrad began its transformation into a socialist state. During that time, two ponies envied each other more and more. Over time their leadership has turned into a competition of personal achievement. The party has split in two groups, each supporting the leader of their preference."
stalliongrad.13.a:0 "It continues."
stalliongrad.14.t:0 "The Construction of the Palace of the Soviets!"
stalliongrad.14.d:0 "Our constructors have started clearing the ground in the city centre. The old pre-revolutionary apartment buildings are being demolished to make space for the new, monumental parliament building, the Palace of the Soviets. This will truly be our greatest architectural achievement. The world will know of the mighty hoof of the Stalliongradian workers!"
stalliongrad.14.a:0 "Future awaits!"
stalliongrad.2.t:0 "Different Outlook"
stalliongrad.2.d:0 "In the latest private meeting of the party members, the main topic of discussion was the situation in the country. As always. The two leaders expressed different plans for the first steps to solving the issues that concern the citizens today. Altidiya suggested that Stalliongrad requires an expansion of the propaganda and educational campaigns in order to make more ponies class-aware and interested in politics, which, in the long run, will provide us with capable ministers and organisers. Vasiliy suggested that the state needs to relocate these resources on supporting the worker cooperatives in Stalliongrad. This path will lead to the industrialisation can be finished quicker."
stalliongrad.2.a:0 "Propaganda broadcasts."
stalliongrad.2.b:0 "Relocate money for industry."
stalliongrad.15.t:0 "Internal Politics"
stalliongrad.15.d:0 "Despite that both leaders have good points and a reasonable approach to running the state, it is obvious that Altidiya is currently an inspirational leader for the people and the pony capable of taking the future of Stalliongrad in her own hooves. Vasiliy, on the other hoof, had a good start, but instead slowed down to a full stop. We need to take measures against Vasiliy's impulses to seize power in the party and expel him, if necessary."
stalliongrad.15.a:0 "Ladno."
stalliongrad.16.t:0 "Internal Politics"
stalliongrad.16.d:0 "Despite the fact that both leaders have good points and a reasonable approach to things in the state, Vasiliy has proven himself as a capable leader. The personal grudge between him and Altidiya, however, cannot continue any longer. We must find a compromise between the two leaders or, if there is enough support of the party members, promote Vasiliy as a new candidate for General Secretary and expel Altidiya from the party, if that is necessary."
stalliongrad.16.a:0 "Posmotrim."
stalliongrad.17.t:0 "Internal Politics"
stalliongrad.17.d:0 "It is obvious that both leaders have good points and a reasonable approach, concerning the situation in the state. However the personal grudge is still tense between them. Recently, Vasiliy demanded a compromise from Altidiya, claiming that he has been doing a great job staying in power under her and that he wants to receive his due appreciation and the higher post of General Secretary of the Party, an equal to Altidiya herself. We need to decide whether we are going to support him or Altidiya."
stalliongrad.17.a:0 "Can we have two general secretaries?"
stalliongrad.18.t:0 "Internal Politics"
stalliongrad.18.d:0 "It is obvious that both leaders have good points and a reasonable approach, concerning the situation in the state. However the personal grudge is still tense between them. Recently, Vasiliy demanded a compromise from Altidiya, claiming that he has been doing a great job staying in power under her and that he wants to receive his due appreciation and the higher post of General Secretary of the Party, an equal to Altidiya herself. We need to decide whether we are going to support him or Altidiya."
stalliongrad.18.a:0 "Posmotrim."
stalliongrad.19.t:0 "Altidiya's Focus"
stalliongrad.19.d:0 "A summit took place in the Supreme Soviet today and, after a long debate, the assembly decided to demote Vasiliy from his post. His policies led to political and economic stagnation and desolation of the country. It is time for us to move forward and form a new government."
stalliongrad.19.a:0 "Da."
stalliongrad.20.t:0 "The New Government"
stalliongrad.20.d:0 "The time has come for Vasiliy to step back and make way for the new ponies in government. Under cover of night, a group of ponies led by Altidiya seized the Supreme Soviet building. Vasiliy, Sinister, Nestor and other members of the party who supported the other side, in fear of reprisals, have crossed the border and fled to Equestria or the Crystal Empire. The new government, with Dark Wing as the head of state, was formed."
stalliongrad.20.a:0 "K luchshemu buduschemu."
stalliongrad.21.t:0 "Vasiliy's Frame of Mind"
stalliongrad.21.d:0 "A summit took place in the Supreme Soviet today and, after hours of debates, the party members chose to support Vasiliy's candidacy on the post of General Secretary. The decision was made based on the votes of the soviet representatives. However, Altidiya and her supporters, such as General Ponyarchuk, refused to give way and step back from the high seat. According to the codex of the party, if, by the end of a debate, where the problem was resolved by a vote, if a member that shows disrespect for the opinion of majority and continues to pursue their own interest, they shall be expelled from the party. It is time for us to act!"
stalliongrad.21.a:0 "Da!"
stalliongrad.22.t:0 "Compromise"
stalliongrad.22.d:0 "Luckily, nothing interrupted the soviet on this sunny [GetMonth] day. Tensions between the two party groups were peacefully talked over. The committee came to an agreement that the conflict should be resolved peacefully. The summits will continue until all the questions are discussed and a solution to all of them is found."
stalliongrad.22.a:0 "Way to go."
stalliongrad.23.t:0 "Party Elections!"
stalliongrad.23.d:0 "Since all of the Altidiya's supporters have been expelled from the party, it is time to elect a new General Secretary. There were several candidates for that post, however, some of them refused to take the responsibility, that leaves us with two main candidates."
stalliongrad.23.a:0 "Let's see."
stalliongrad.24.t:0 "The Power of the Ponies"
stalliongrad.24.d:0 "Arguments in the Supreme Soviet are rising in strength every day. As a more active and radical pony, Altidiya promotes change and openness of the state affairs to the public. Vasiliy argues that to prevent counter-revolution and promote stability, Stalliongrad should stick to the current government and wait for the right moment to act. They both suggest their own vision of the actions to take in the current situation."
stalliongrad.24.a:0 "Jest."
stalliongrad.25.t:0 "The Plans"
stalliongrad.25.d:0 "The summit has been held in the Supreme Council today and Vasiliy suggested that Stalliongrad needs to focus on improving its infrastructure in order to create more workplaces and connect remote areas together. Altidiya offered her plan majoring on military industry in Stalliongrad itself, as the state needs to protect itself. It is up to the soviets to decide what plan are we going to follow."
stalliongrad.25.a:0 "Tak."
stalliongrad.26.t:0 "Pantsushenko's Crew"
stalliongrad.26.d:0 "Altidiya's supporters have been expelled from the party and their occupations cleared. The elements Altidiya was about to bring into power were very suspicious. We can with confidence say that we've prevented counter-revolution and collapse of the Stalliongradian state. General Ponyarchuk, Kors Relux, Ivan, and Dark Wing are no longer a threat to us. All the old leaders remain in their posts, however, and are ready to continue their work on the path of reaching communism in Stalliongrad."
stalliongrad.26.a:0 "Well deserved."
stalliongrad.27.t:0 "Sinister Serov"
stalliongrad.27.d:0 "Sinister Serov announced his intentions to participate in the elections. Earlier, he supported Vasily and was a part of the same coalition with him, but his different view on the solution of state problems made him take a separate stance in this elections. \n Sinnie's speech is demagogic and populist, he insists on toughening the role of the state in all spheres of society, but at the same time openly expresses his view on ineffectiveness of the collective farm system and the need to allow market elements in agriculture. The pony has imperialistic ambitions, justified by the struggle against plutocratic enemies, and calls to build up Stalliongrad's hegemony on the continent."
stalliongrad.27.a:0 "Tak."
stalliongrad.28.t:0 "Vasiliy"
stalliongrad.28.d:0 "Vasiliy Pantsushenko was a prime minister after Altidiya whose political rhetoric is characterised by ultra-communist convictions. Vasiliy stands for preserving and toughening the "true-socialist way" of the state ideology and supports interventionist foreign policy. He has gained paranoia after years of work with Altidiya, that affects his political course in both foreign and internal spheres. He claims he struggles for "purity" of the communist ideas in the party and will to defend the achievements of revolution to an end."
stalliongrad.28.a:0 "Tak."
stalliongrad.29.t:0 "Dark Wing"
stalliongrad.29.d:0 "Darkwing begins his election campaign with an appeal to the ponies of Stalliongrad. Speaking of his goals as the ruler of Stalliongrad, he calls himself loyal to Altidiya Revoltsova and her ideas. At the same time, Darkwing considers other party leaders to be corrupt and incompetent, and lays the blame of famine and the economic difficulties entirely on them. \n The politician saw the way out of the crisis in the rapprochement and cooperation with Equestria, first of all for the common good, in order to overcome hunger, and for mutual protection against the growing threat represented by changelings."
stalliongrad.29.a:0 "Tak."
stalliongrad.30.t:0 "Elections!"
stalliongrad.30.d:0 "We are gathered here today to elect a new General Secretary of the Stalliongradian Communist Party. The decisions of the general secretary are going to be most influential in the state's foreign and internal politics. We have two candidates to choose from."

stalliongrad.32.a:0 "Long live."
stalliongrad.32.a:0 "Long live."
stalliongrad.34.t:0 "Urgent Elections"
stalliongrad.34.d:0 "Altidiya has retired due to her poor health condition. She is no longer capable of managing the state on General Secretary post. The Supreme Soviet declares elections for a new leader for that occupation. Candidates have two months to debate and show themselves as good contenders."
stalliongrad.34.a:0 "Uvidim."
stalliongrad.35.t:0 "Ten Conditions"
stalliongrad.35.d:0 "[GetDate]. On today's summit it was decided to finally reconcile the two leaders. Listing his ten conditions to Altidiya, he demanded them all to be met by her. He exclaimed that if the head of state refuses them, Vasiliy is going to leave the party."

stalliongrad.35.b:0 "Decline the demand."
stalliongrad.36.t:0 "Dark Wing seizes power"
stalliongrad.36.d:0 "Under cover of night Dark Wing and his collaborators have set the Supreme Soviet building on fire. In the morning the blame for these actions was put on Vasiliy's supporters.

stalliongrad.37.d:0 "After Polya's retirement there are no ponies that we can turn to other than the second leader after her, Dark Wing. he calls himself loyal to Altidiya Coggydeer and her ideas. At the same time, Darkwing considers former party members to be corrupt and incompetent, he lays the blame of food problems and the economic difficulties entirely on them. \n Dark Wing sees the way out of the crisis in the rapprochement and cooperation with Equestria, first of all for the common good, in order to overcome hunger, and for mutual protection against the growing threat of changelings."
stalliongrad.37.a:0 "Okay."
stalliongrad.4000.t:0 "Landowners and petite bourgeoisie rebel!"
stalliongrad.4000.d:0 "Big landowners that were not persecuted when the collectivisation started now have freedom to continue their exploitation of free peasant ponies.

stalliongrad.42.d:0 "For a decade now, Starlight Village brought up by infamous Starlight Glimmer, was sitting at our doorstep.

stalliongrad.38.d:0 "On its recent broadcast appeal addressed to its citizen the government of STG solemnly announced opening of embassy in the territory of the Equestrian Kingdom for the purpose of "cooperation in deficiency". Really pleasant news on a background of the hunger raging in the country which bony paws have already claimed lives of several thousand citizens.

stalliongrad.38.a:0 "Hm."
stalliongrad.39.t:0 "Food Problem and Solution"
stalliongrad.39.d:0 "On his very first visit in Equestria, General Secretary [STG.GetLeader] begged Equestrian officials to support the struggling nation. The public is rather discouraged than pleased with that turn of events."

stalliongrad.40.t:0 "The home of revolution"

stalliongrad.95.t:0 "Hunger continues"
stalliongrad.95.d:0 "For the last few weeks, no book, magazine, or a newspaper was released without mentioning hunger. Two years of a crop failure couldn't pass easy.

Having been defeated in Canterlot almost 10 years ago, the imperialist Chrysalis is once again preparing to throw the yoke of exploitation on the entire pony race. She concentrated huge forces. A working changeling is oppressed and subordinated to her aggression. This enemy is much stronger and more terrible than the capitalist Equestria. But our faith in victory is stronger than ever. We have excellent weapons, we have excellent industry, and most importantly - we have the spirit, we are fighting for our freedom.

We declare, that if the enemy tries to thrust their hoof into the Stalliongradian land, they will receive a counterattack so strong, it will not only lead to their defeat on our land, but also to defeat in Equestria. The Equestrian workers will not go to fratricidal war against their Stalliongradian brothers, but will turn bayonets against their oppressors. Bourgeoisie in Equestria was defeated once, and, no doubt, will be defeated again. But we can not rely only on our brothers. Every pony should be on the alert. We have excellent weapons, we have excellent industry, and most importantly - we have the spirit to fight for our freedom and the freedom proletariat.

The revolution in Equestria, about the necessity of which the great comrade Stallion spoke, will begin very soon. The Ponies Communist Party, headed by Comrade Starlight, has been doing tremendous work enlightening the oppressed masses and mobilising them to fight. And now, when the Soviets of workers and peasants are being organised in all of Equestria, when oppressed Equestrian ponies have risen to the struggle, we can not stand aside. We will stretch out the hooves to help our class brothers. Comrades - equestrians! I believe that you will respond to the call to defend the cause of Freedom.

Monsters, whose motives are the same as those of an animal - endless hunger and bloodthirsty cruelty.\n\nThat is why today, our duty is a sacred war against this abomination.\n\nWithout the official declaration of war to the representatives of the chitinous imperialists, our divisions have already started the liberation of the lands occupied by Changelings, bearing not only the liberation to workers, but spreading our word as well - a word about true equality, order and justice. This is a great day when our ideology will finally reveal its true essence - the essence of the protector of all people and the civilisation itself.\n\nOur region has always been famous for the harsh, cold climate that caused our ancestors to suffer - but one day we tamed nature, we changed it, adapting it to our own needs. Remember the years of oppression under the deceitful Goddesses, when days and nights we worked for them, but there were no real social guarantees - only hypocritical dogmas about illusory Harmony. Remember what difficulties we encountered during the revolutionary war, and after it - when all the "civilised" nations in one moment exposed their plutocratic face, trying to destroy our righteous society by the most heinous methods. But we overcame these difficulties - we became strong and proud as never. And now, we full of determination to achieve new peak and conquer new fortresses.\n\nThis is a necessary war, it is a war that under no circumstances could be avoided. History always requires us to choose: life or death, freedom or slavery.

Now we must answer them with our steel determination.\n\nRemember who you are, proud Stalliongradians! We are a people who have thrown off the heavy chains of Equestrian exploitation. We have become a country of true democracy, freedom and order. Our technologies, our industry and our powerful weapons are famous all over the world. Knowing this, our cruel enemy intends to capture all our achievements. Bring it to yourself, just like a barbarian, as they really are.\n\nWe must show the true honour and courage of our people, trampling the invaders with the horseshoe straight into the swamps from which they all came. Our determination in the fight against the changeling swarm should be an example for every state in the world.\n\nAllow your rifle to carry the word about our righteous ideology through the counter strike to the abominable bug.\n\nThis is a sacred war; it is a war that under no circumstances could be failed.

stalliongrad.133.d:0 "Comrades! I want to announce the news as exciting as the great ones. Our righteous socialist country was attacked, and by these actions Equestria finally showed its true face - the disgusting face of the reactionary plutocracy.\n\nA great people such as the Stalliongradians cannot remain in suspense and we are proud to participate in this gigantic struggle which is destined to transform the world geographically, politically and spiritually. Truly, there is taking place today a formidable struggle between two worlds. Never has the history seen a similar drama, a drama in which we are now among the great leading characters.\n\nThe task of the hour is one and only one: To fight, to fight all together. The comradeship between us becomes closer day by day, becomes a way of common life. We are similar enough and different enough to understand each other, to esteem each other mutually, to fuse together all our energies, since the cause is one. No longer can distinctions be made; our enemies do not make any.\n\nThe Equestrian plutocracy are conducting this war with one sole purpose: They want to reduce the globe to the state in which Buffalo State is today. They want all of people to work in order to give the Equestrian Bourgeoisie an another millennium of another name of exploitation - a "Harmony". They want a world of slaves in order to guarantee for the Сanterlot aristocracy their five daily digestions. They want to destroy Communism, and under this name they include all the movements such as include Starlight ideology that named as Equality...\n\nNow, comrades, we must fight for the living ones, fight for the future, but also for the dead. We must fight so that the sacrifice of our dead be not in vain, so that the sacrifice of those who fell in the revolutionary war.\n\nThey, the dead, imperiously command us to fight through till victory.

We go to battle against the plutocratic and reactionary “Harmony” of fake goddesses who, at every moment have hindered the advance and have often endangered the very existence of the Stalliongradian people.\n\nRecent historical events can be summarised in the following phrases: promises, threats, blackmail and sabotage. With you the entire world is witness that Communist Stalliongrad has done all that is possible to avoid the torment which is throwing our continent into turmoil; but all was in vain. It would have sufficed to revise the treaties to bring them up to date with the changing needs of the life of our nation and not consider them untouchable for eternity.\n\nBut now all of that belongs to the past. If now today we have decided to face the risks and the sacrifices of a war, it is because the honour, the interests, the future impose an iron necessity, since a great people is truly such if it considers sacred its own duties and not evade the supreme trials which change the course of history.\n\nWe take rifles in hooves to free the working people of all Equestria from exploitation and plutocracy, which in the minds of the masses is indestructible and endless.\n\nThis gigantic struggle is nothing other than a phase in the logical development of our revolution; it is the struggle of peoples that are poor but rich in workers against the exploiters who hold on ferociously to the monopoly off all the riches and all the gold of the world; it is the struggle between our century and two ideas.\n\nProletarian Stalliongrad stands up again, strong, proud, and united as never before. The single order of the day is categorical and obligatory for all. And this order is... Victory! And we will win, in order finally to give a long period of peace with justice to Stalliongrad, to Equestria, and to the world.\n\nComrades!\nThis is a war to end all wars!"

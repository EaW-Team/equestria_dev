BAN_border_guard_desc:0 "We gotta keep an eye on the border, you never know when an attack can happen. Blackrock has chosen "volunteers" who will patrol the common border and keep us informed of anything amiss. A bandit gotta be always prepared, or won't live for long."

BAN_civilize_blackhollow_desc:0 "As much as we love to lord over the peasants, scaring them straight every other week, sooner or later they're going to start off a real revolt.

### Events ###
bandit.1.t:0 "The Prywhen Civil War"
bandit.1.d:0 ""Gentlegriffs.", Blackrock adressed the crowd in what she liked to call the war room, which was merely a barren spacious room that had a large map of the region nailed to the wall. "As you may know, civil war has been going on for years now in Prywhen, and both sides are using drastic measures to achieve total victory. This means, however, that they are weak, and won't be able to resist if we were to invite ourselves to their lands and do some... shopping. What say you louts, shall we invade or not?"\n\nAs she expected, her griffons promptly started loudly arguing with one another over the course of action, some even engaging in improptu brawls, while others were screaming that the lands of Prywhen were a "Maar-blasted hellhole" that should be avoided at all costs. By the Gods, she hated when they started bickering like chicks. Taking out her pistol, she fired a shot to the ceiling, an another hole joining the others. Wasn't her first time.\n\n"Quit screeching like immature children and present your opinion in an orderly, nonviolent fashion. Do we raid Prywhen, or not?""
bandit.1.a:0 "They're weak and vulnerable! We'll strike the next week!"
bandit.1.b:0 "Prywhen is a burning wreck, we're staying home."

bandit.2.t:0 "Blackrock Demands Tribute"
bandit.2.d:0 "Armed envoys arrived from [From.Capital.GetName] today, sent by their infamous boss Blackrock. They came to remind us of our status as a tributary and that it's time for us to pay, or else the raids will continue like before."
bandit.2.a:0 "This way no blood is shed..."
bandit.2.b:0 "We are now strong enough to resist them!"
bandit.2.c:0 "You will cease being a tributary.\n"

bandit.3.t:0 "[From.GetName] Allies With Us"
bandit.3.d:0 "For months now we have secretly been aiding the rightful Countess of Blackhollow, Cyrille Bluecrest. Members of the Bluecrest dynasty were once loyal servants of the Kings of Griffonstone and have always been friendly with our Prince's house of Whitecrest. We have supplied them weapons and advisors, and in return the Countess has officially proclaimed that she will come to our aid whenever we need it. In return, [LUS.GetLeader] is more than happy to promise the same. Let our houses be united in friendship for centuries to come! Together we will weather any storm."
bandit.3.a:0 "May our friendship stay strong!"

bandit.4.t:0 "The Bazaar of the Bizarre"
bandit.4.d:0 "The criminal underground is a host to many colourful types from across the entire Griffonia. Smugglers looking for a quick profit, dissatisfied soldiers selling their extra supplies, zebras selling slaves and so much more. Morality is a foreign word in these parts, and money is the only emperor here. With the spoils of our plunder, we've arrived here today to acquire modern weapon models... The choice remains in what sort should we look after. Anything can be found here, after all."
bandit.4.a:0 "Rifles and submachine guns. Our guns are rusting."
bandit.4.b:0 "Artillery pieces and improved shells. We could use an extra punch."
bandit.4.c:0 "Support equipment. The griffons need their bandages and radios."

bandit.5.t:0 "Using Our Stockpiles"
bandit.5.d:0 "After an extensive search and decent amount of grumbling, Gaston and his griffons have located and retrieved all of our hidden rifle stashes. Some of the weapons found are of improved design compared to our standards, which we will put to good use. In summary, no bandit lacks a weapon now. We are prepared."
bandit.5.a:0 "Excellent."

bandit.6.t:0 "An "Offer" From Blackrock"
bandit.6.d:0 "A letter has arrived today from the neighbouring lawless land of Blackhollow. It would be more accurate to describe it as a open threat than as an offer - the notorious bandit leader Blackrock is demanding that our nation becomes a subservient tributary... Or else her vagabonds will continue to raid our lands."
bandit.6.a:0 "If it keeps them off our backs, fine."
bandit.6.c:0 "You will become a tributary. Blackrock will no longer raid you, but she can demand you to pay tribute.\n"
bandit.6.b:0 "We don't negotiate with thugs and cutpurses."
bandit.6.e:0 "Blackrock will continue to raid you.\n"

bandit.7.t:0 "Our Request, Denied!"
bandit.7.d:0 "Our best attempt to convince our neighbour into accepting a mutually beneficial relationship has been rejected. Blackrock will be furious, undoubtedly. She will likely blow off some steam by raiding the arrogant bastards."
bandit.7.a:0 "Let's get ready for that."

bandit.8.t:0 "Plundering Griffonstone"
bandit.8.d:0 "Blackrock smirked as she sat upon a bale of hay, just outside a village. The work was done, so the Queen of Bandits lit a cigarette as she watched the last of her birds leave the little hamlet they had chosen to raid tonight. Her raiding party gathered behind her, waiting with glee for what was to come. Each and every one of them had a large sack filled with loot of whatever they could find. The locals were long gone, well, the ones who didn’t get shot, anyhow. And now, after a night of stealing othergriffons’ hard work, it was time to let off some steam.\n\nBlackrock raised her voice, her cigarette almost up. "We’re gonna leave soon, you lousy penguins. The sack of potatoes Griffonstone calls a government will someday find out about our antics." The griffon looked down, taking in the air of petrol, which had made a nice puddle at her feet, a stream extending towards the few houses that made up this village. "Enjoy the show."\n\nA flick of her talon and the cigarette fell to the ground. A stream of light made its way to the houses and in an eyeblink, the village turned into a sea of flames. Their work in Griffonstone was done!"
bandit.8.a:0 "Time to head home, folks."

bandit.81.t:0 "Bandit Raids"
bandit.81.d:0 "It seems that Blackrock’s Bandits have crossed our borders. These scourges have descended upon our countryside like a swarm of locusts, leaving nothing standing and retreating home before the police or the army could react. Some griffons are angry and the lords demand retribution for these ungodly acts. Others say we are too poor and weak to retaliate and have no other option than to pray to Arcturius so he can protect us from further raids."
bandit.81.a:0 "Criminals will pay the price."
bandit.81.b:0 "Have faith in Arcturius..."

bandit.9.t:0 "Riding High"
bandit.9.d:0 "The depressed denizens of Falcor are the perfect consumers for our goods. With their hatred of Wingbardy, it is an easy entry point into the drug trade, with little competition from the Karthin Mafia. The trade is lucrative and Blackrock has spent the last three days deciding which extravagant luxury she was going to get for herself. A swimming pool? A marble statue of herself? A golden gun? With the drug money, everything was possible. It was a win-win, for her."
bandit.9.a:0 "Screw the rules, I have money!"

bandit.91.t:0 "The War on Drugs"
bandit.91.d:0 "Recently, drug-related deaths have increased drastically. Cheap drugs have been flooding in over the borders and from the few smugglers we managed to capture, the source is clear. The Blackrock Bandits over in Blackhollow. Somehow, these griffons have managed to find truckloads of narcotics and they have chosen our country to start their drug empire. The police is doing the best they can, but with so many new drug-addicts and the rise of all sort of crime coming with it, we will be fighting the war on drugs for a long time."
bandit.91.a:0 "We will protect the [Root.GetAdjective] Way!"

bandit.10.t:0 "The Sicameon Syndicate"
bandit.10.d:0 "Blackrock smirked as she took a piece of paper from one of her lieutenants. Her infiltration of Sicameon was going well. She looked at the numbers. Two dozen new recruits, 3 murders of griffons who had ‘moral objections’. And the decentralised mess that was her south-western neighbour was unable to coordinate efforts.\n\n"Two-hundred-ninety-four." She said it slowly, chuckling to herself. 294, the amount of independent police departments in Sicameon. Most of the time the policegriffs were too busy with local issues to help each other fight her network of bandits. Of course, the money flowed in. Blackrock dismissed her lieutenant, putting down the paperwork to play with a coin in her talon. Like she always said; It was good to be bad."
bandit.10.a:0 "Crime pays."

bandit.101.t:0 "Blackrock Targets Us"
bandit.101.d:0 "Blackrock or ‘The Bandit Queen of Blackhollow’ as she apparently styles herself, has targeted our country. She has recruited and coordinated local criminals into a true syndicate of efficient heisting. Before the local police can make a good case, the griffons fly to the next parish, trusting the rough terrain and our localised administration will make it so we won’t follow them. Everytime we get somegriffon to talk about the organisation, they get murdered somehow, indicated that some policegriffs were involved too. It will take a long concentrated effort to track these petty criminals down, but justice will win out in the end."
bandit.101.a:0 "We are stronger than she thinks."

bandit.11.t:0 "Poppy Fields"
bandit.11.d:0 "The wilder parts of Cyanolisia have turned out to be excellent for growing drugs and setting up workshops for making the synthetic parts. The wilderness has turned into quite the productive enterprise and with some well-placed bribes, the enterprise has managed to elude the authorities. From there couriers smuggled the tablets away on their way to some (un)lucky customer.\n\nOf course the waste for all those products had to be dumped somewhere and Blackrock was certain that in a hundred years, all these chemicals would turn Cyanolisia’s forests into a second Scheißwald. But that wasn’t really her problem now, was it?"
bandit.11.a:0 "Who wants to live forever?"

bandit.102.t:0 "Bandit Pollution"
bandit.102.d:0 "The forest rangers came back with a barrel leaking warm green fluid. It was the third find of drug waste this month and the problem kept getting worse. No griffon seemed to know where these drug industries were hiding, but they had to be somewhere in the wild. The criminals seemed to have a part of our country under their claw and it is up to the rangers and the police to take care of the problem."
bandit.102.a:0 "Boreas preserve the just."

bandit.12.t:0 "Factory Construction Completed"
bandit.12.d:0 "We've put the captives from our most recent raid to good use. As it turns out, some of them have experience in constructing and designing industrial plants. While we have some standards and don't allow slavery here, unlike those shifty zebras, we've promised to set them free if they were to build us a factory. Surprisingly, these griffons did their task with minimal complaint, and now we have a new liquor factory."
bandit.12.a:0 "Excellent."

bandit.13.t:0 "Military Workshop Completed"
bandit.13.d:0 "Through intimidation and coercion, we've got the worthless peasants to build and operate a workshop for producing shiny new firearms. Our diligent overseers will ensure our quotas are met, and that some sort of decent labour experience exists. The second part is optional, of course."
bandit.13.a:0 "More guns!"

bandit.14.t:0 "An Influx of Crooks"
bandit.14.d:0 "Following the mass escapes from various high security prisons across southern Griffonia, a large number of these hardened, vicious griffons have made their way to our lands, seeking sanctuary from the law. We welcome these dashing rogues, provided they refrain from causing excessive trouble."
bandit.14.a:0 "We'll put them to good use."

bandit.15.t:0 "Bandit Cruelty"
bandit.15.d:0 "News has reached Murkbeak about an secluded mountain village being burned down and all of its inhabitants gunned down. From what we could piece together, Gaston, a notoriously dim griffon, was attempting to extort a tribute from the villagers. After they could offer nothing but the clothes off their backs and old grain, Gaston, in a fit of rage, ordered his griffons to slaughter and raze the village to the ground. Afterward, he was strutting around and telling to anyone who'd listed, that they had it coming for being poor."
bandit.15.a:0 "Regrettable, but isn't a real issue."

bandit.16.t:0 "Drunken Disaster"
bandit.16.d:0 "Our firefighters - who also serve as racketeers, bodyguards and fences, depending on the day - had their claws full last night, after an arms factory had suddenly caught fire and burned down to the foundations. Investigation has revealed that during their evening shift, the slacking workers decided to cut their time with drunken revelry. One thing led to another, and the fun quickly ended after they attempted to discover what happens if you were to mix gunpowder, alcohol and a stack of matches."
bandit.16.a:0 "Typical."

bandit.17.t:0 "Peasant Reprisal"
bandit.17.d:0 "Fear keeps the mob in line, that is true, but we've pushed the civilians too hard and they've retaliated by staging an insurrection. While this pitiful rebellion was struck down in a day, it wasn't without its price - homes, stores and factories lie in wrack and ruin. It will take us considerable time to rebuild the vital buildings."
bandit.17.a:0 "There will be consenquences for this."

bandit.18.t:0 "Influx of Drugs"
bandit.18.d:0 "The trafficking drug ring has lately had a surge of success, and perhaps, luck. The plants' yield has been higher than average, and with that, we were able to sell more. The boss will be pleased with the profits, she's been eyeing some fine jewelry lately..."
bandit.18.a:0 "Life is good."

bandit.19.t:0 "Missing Contraband"
bandit.19.d:0 "Blackrock won't be happy with this, not one bit. We've been planning a large trade with one of the biggest Wingbardian mafias for a while - and these birds don't mess around - but few days before the trade was set to take place, we've discovered our stock of drugs has been significantly depleted. The guards swear by their lives that no thief got past them, nor did they indulge in vices - but the fact remains that the Wingbardians will be severely displeased if we renege on our deal. Replenishing our stock on such a quick notice will cut heavily into our profit margin."
bandit.19.a:0 "Of all the..."

bandit.20.t:0 "Raiding the Poncy Nobles"
bandit.20.d:0 "The old nobility that ruled this land long ago has been and still is a thorn in our side. They hide in their mountain holds, plotting their return. While their schemes are nothing but a flight of fancy, to say the least, they still contest our rule and rouse the peasants into committing acts of rebellion. Thus, to teach them a lesson, we've raided one of the weaker holds and depleted it of its inhabitants. The late noble was so kind to leave us a large amount of precious stones and ornaments."
bandit.20.a:0 "I'd like some of that, yes."

bandit.21.t:0 "Caravan Plundered"
bandit.21.d:0 "Everygriff should know that pride marks your end. In a bold attempt, a trade caravan carrying various semi-precious goods, such as imported food, foreign texts, rare materials from Aquileia and so on, has attempted to take a shortcut through our country in order to secure a larger reward from their clients. Needless to say, while their escapade worked for a few days, after our patrols discovered them they were quickly seized and their puny protection was cut down. Should have known better than going through Blackrock's land."
bandit.21.a:0 "Prey stepping into the trap willingly? Amusing."

bandit.22.t:0 "Bandit Infighting"
bandit.22.d:0 "Victory does not always guarantee success in the end, unfortunately. Following a successful raid on a Falconese port town, our raiders started squabbling over dividing the loot. Tensions flared up, rivalries were brought to light, and afterward a shootout occured in which most of our griffons perished. The survivors, driven by greed and fear, seized all of the spoils and have reneged on their oath to Blackrock."
bandit.22.a:0 "They won't live for long."

bandit.23.t:0 "The Raid on Blackrock's Treasury"
bandit.23.d:0 "Blackrock has always had a habit for keeping track of her victories. So much, that she has made a trophy room in her makeshift mansion, which she frequently visits and reminiscences about the good times. It is, of course, heavily guarded by her most loyal bandits.\n\nAnd yet, this did not deter a flock of foreign criminals who had immigrated here recently. Showing that there is no honour among thieves, these daring griffons have plotted to abscond with the boss' riches for a long time, and last night, their efforts came to success as they stole Blackrock's entire stash of stolen jewelry - which she enjoys taking from those stiff necked nobles - and fled as quickly as they came. The guards were stumped at being so egregiously duped, and did not have a good day once Blackrock found out..."
bandit.23.a:0 "I will have their beaks for this! You are all incompetent cowards!"

bandit.24.t:0 "An Uneventful Day"
bandit.24.d:0 "Blackrock stood on her balcony, gazing proudly across the lands she called her own. It was good to be the Queen, certainly. Her followers were dedicated and loyal, for all their vices, and her spoils have been growing ever larger. And yet... she began feeling bored of the conventional extravagance. She's been sitting on her rear for long enough, it's time to do something productive instead of making coin castles or playing Stalliongradian roulette. With that, she took flight and headed for the local tavern."
bandit.24.a:0 "A drink, to clear the ennui..."

bandit.25.t:0 "Tribute from a Tributary"
bandit.25.d:0 "Carts full of gold, food and weapons have arrived today in Murkbeak. It is a result of our "diplomacy" working out in our favour. As long as we keep our tributaries cowering in fear of our retribution, we can expect more carts like these soon enough. At this rate, we might not even have to go out on raids anymore."

bandit.29.d_neutral:0 "In the dark and forested valley of Blackhollow lies the old seat of the County, in an old and dilapitated castle surrounded by a small town. Years ago the surrounding foreboding forests were infested with bandits who prepared occasional raids, but now those same vagabonds occupied the castle itself, having turned it into a ramshackle nest of debauchery and crime.\n\nNow the tables had turned and the nobles themselves prepared in the forest to retake Blackhollow, the former capital. First the town was surrounded with raiding parties emerging from the forest and cutting off any road connections to it, then some cannons were set up on the opposite side of the river. The bombardment began and drove the bandits into the castle, allowing the Countess' griffons to seize the town. The precious castle would not be damaged and was instead left alone. The criminal scum stuck inside would eventually starve and surrender. Countess Cyrille, who had led the attacking forces personally, sat on the old throne of the Bluecrest Counts and almost cried from joy. She was back home."

There, they could prepare for their attack peacefully, unseen by Blackrock's scum. A series of surprise raids cut off all roads leading to the town of Blackhollow, and sharpshooters secured the riverbanks, shooting any bandit ships sailing down the river. As Reeve lead his followers to attack the town, the cowardly bandits retreated into the castle, the old symbol of feudal oppression. Reeve immediately ordered cannons to be set up for the complete demolishment of the building. After three days of bombardment, nothing remained except a pile of smouldering rubble and corpses."

bandit.30.t:0 "Assault on Murkbeak"
bandit.30.d_neutral:0 "The land of Blackhollow contains very little arable land, with most of it being around Lake Murk. Yet even here, perilous marshes are scattered everywhere. The capital of the region, Murkbeak, has grown after Blackrock's wicked reign began and is now the largest town in the country. It is a vile hive of scum and villainy, filled with the worst griffonkind has to offer. While Blackrock never stays in one place for long, the closest thing to her "home" is in the center of Murkbeak, where she stores her trophies.\n\nThe battle of Murkbeak would be hard, yet if the Countess took it, it would be a great victory that would shatter the morale of the bandit scum. Farmers around the town, who gave away most of their food as tribute to the criminals, eagerly joined the Countess when her forces arrived in the region. Soon enough bandit outposts had been destroyed and Murkbeak was surrounded by a large host of angry griffons. Cyrille was confident, but then she saw that Blackrock herself was leading the defenders and organized a solid defence, with many barricades on the streets and snipers on the roofs. The battle would be bloody.\n\nThree times the Countess' supporters attacked, and three times they were repulsed. Some machine guns stolen from Falcor had been set up and in the center of the town there was an artillery battery seized from Angriver. Hundreds died, mostly on the Countess' side. It was clear a direct assault could only end in failure, so instead the Countess tried a different approach. In the nearby marshes, packs of Hydras prowled. They could easily regenerate their wounds and did not fear the sound of gunshots. The Countess sent a group of her soldiers to harass and lure the Hydras away from the swamps into Murkbeak. The plan worked and soon the bandits fled in droves as massive hydras tore through their lines, still alive even as some of their heads were torn apart by artillery shells, constantly regenerating their wounds. The rampage lasted for several hours. After the Hydras were finally killed, some by Blackrock herself, it was followed by a swift attack by the Countess' forces. The bandits were utterly defeated and flew away, some being shot in mid-air. Blackrock managed to escape but her own fortress was looted bare."

While Blackrock never stays in one place for long, the closest thing to her "home" is in the center of Murkbeak, where she stores her trophies.\n\nReeve knew taking Murkbeak from the bandit oppressors would be difficult, at least if they tried attacking from the outside. His scouts reported that Blackrock herself was leading the defenders and organized a solid defence, with many barricades on the streets and snipers on the roofs. But an attack from within combined with an attack from beyond would surely crush their defence. He sent griffons to the surrounding countryside to recruit farmers, who gave away most of their food as tribute to the criminals, and also sent infiltrators and spies into Murkbeak disguised as criminals. There they told the local enslaved servants and workers that their liberation would come, but only if they took up arms and fought.\n\nWhen Reeve attacked, Blackrock was ready for him. Some machine guns stolen from Falcor had been set up and in the center of the town there was an artillery battery seized from Angriver. But she was not ready for the attack from behind her lines as the proles rose up, armed with tools and stolen guns. She had to split her defence and fight on two fronts, which soon proved to be unwinnable. Nevertheless Reeve's revolutionaries and the rebelling servants took hundreds of casualties and paid dearly. Blackrock herself managed to wound Reeve in the eye with an accurate rifle shot. But soon she realized that the battle was lost and her bandits fled in droves, flying away from the town. She cursed Reeve's name and fled as well rather than fighting to the last. Afterwards Reeve, with a bandage on his eye, raised the red flag of revolution on top of Blackrock's fortress and proclaimed Murkbeak to be the new capital of the commune. Soldiers and rebels alike cheered and celebrated the arrival of equality in Murkbeak."

bandit.31.d_neutral:0 "Over two centuries ago, the most famous event in the long history of the Creeper Mountains took place as Grover I crossed them with his vast army. The eastern principalities had expected him to attack from the north or the south, and they were completely taken by surprise as Grover invaded from the west and occupied their towns and cities. The minotaurs who had ruled the mountains protested to the Emperor and demanded him to give them back. He responded by crushing their army and seizing their mainland states which later became the County of Cyanolisia. It is said the castle in Talltower was built by his engineers to guard the pass he used and ensure no one in the east would try to use it like he had done. Nowadays it was a bandit stronghold where they prepared raids to Cyanolisia and Sicameon.\n\nCapturing Talltower and driving the bandits away from the Creeper Mountains would be difficult, so the Countess picked the finest mountaineers and the bravest fliers from the ranks of her soldiers for a two-pronged assault on Talltower. One company would attack from above, another from the valley below. This plan worked well: As the bandits focused on repelling the mountaineers, they were ambushed from the skies and could not use cover to hide from the sudden onslaught. The castle was taken after brutal close quarters combat, from the top floor to the bottom. Several days passed as the soldiers then surveyed the surrounding mountains and destroyed scattered bandit hideouts."

To show an example to his soldiers, he would personally lead the daring attack south. He gathered most of the revolutionaries as he believed numbers were necessary for victory, and one by one captured scattered bandit outposts in the mountains before only Talltower remained, its garrison too bold to surrender. Reeve decided to use his single advantage and attacked from above, leading all his numerous soldiers in a large swarm that blotted out the sun. The bandit sharpshooters on rooftops were shaken, especially when their gunfire did little to stop the attackers. The cloud of revolutionaries descended upon Talltower, slaughtering the outnumbered bandits with ease and besieging the castle. The few defenders inside held out for two weeks before running out of food and surrendering. Their wings were cut off and they were thrown down from the cliff as Reeve raised the red flag atop the castle."

bandit.32.d_neutral:0 "Banditplace is where it all began. For centuries these sparsely populated and tall mountains have been infested with criminals who prey on griffons of nearby regions. So infamous was this bandit infestation that the area was named after it. Civilization is a foreign concept here, with the largest settlements being crime-ridden gatherings of shacks nested in valleys or sprawled upon mountaintops. This is where Blackrock grew up and where her takeover began all those years ago. So fittingly, her reign of terror will now end where it began.\n\nCountess Cyrille began a task that her predecessors should've done long ago. She organized her finest soldiers into squads of bandit-hunters and trained them to fight with the same guerrilla tactics their enemy used. Then the soldiers were sent out to purge Banditplace. They made sure to only attack during night-time, and use hit-and-run raids to cause as much damage as possible while taking minimal casualties in return. Bandit groups were ambushed in the dales and snipers occupied the peaks. The bandit outposts were burnt and slain foes crucified to set an example. Soon enough bandits began to flee the region in droves, taking their ill-gotten goods with them. Some remained, hiding in caverns and secret tunnels, but Banditplace was now mostly in the Countess' claws."

Now a new age would begin in the nation and it would be heralded with the purging of Banditplace. The criminal pockets and hideouts were many, but they were scattered, and in the end Reeve had more than enough angry peasants on his side who were tired of being raided, robbed and extorted. So he assembled a mighty host to march eastwards and fill the valleys like a feathered flood. The small and spread out settlements stood no chance on their own, and one by one they fell. In the end some organized resistance formed, but by then it was too little too late. The red tide washed over them and those who survived fled across the border."

Bandit garrisons were surrounded and attacked, with many of them being completely destroyed even before the Countess' soldiers entered the region. Then commanders of the two militia forces met and planned a combined offensive against the bandits. In return, Cyrille promised to reinstate Naniwich autonomy. The cooperation proved fruitful as the scattered bandits stood no chance against them. Soon enough Naniwich was free once more."

Only after the revolutionaries had shed much blood and defeated several bandit outposts and warbands did the Naniwich griffons finally launch their attack. With Blackrock's goons surprised from the flank, they could offer little resistance and were soon defeated. But after the victory Naniwich towns were still very hesitant about letting Reeve's forces come close and after some violent skirmishes Reeve signed an agreement with local leaders that granted them considerable autonomy."

Blackrock, whose real name is known by few, has always been a staunch rebel against the established norm and rule, having once been a republican and participating in the revolution of 978. Griffonia at large first heard of her name when she led deserters and bandits against Count Caelen Bluecrest, slaying him personally in 1001 after a decade of war. Now, she seeks to subjugate and pillage southern Griffonia to her heart's content."

The dynasty ruled over these lands in a just manner as loyal subjects of Griffonstone, but when their overlords refused to reward them for their aid in the counter-revolution of 979, they declared independence. This was soon followed by a failed invasion and a bandit uprising. With their beloved Count Caelen Bluecrest slain by Blackrock herself, thugs had an easy way taking over these lands. Nonethless, the Bluecrests have persevered and Cyrille swore in her father's name to restore the rightful rulers of Blackhollow. After a bloody struggle, her dream became a reality, and now Cyrille wishes to undo the devastation of the previous decades."

This perfect society latched to his thoughts and desires, and once he returned to his former home, now a haven for bandits, he put every effort into replicating that community. His vision is now on the cusp of success."

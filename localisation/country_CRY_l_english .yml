CRY_steel_factories_in_crystal_city_desc:0 "The more weapons and vehicles we produce, the more metal we need. Authorizing the construction of additional steel mills in the capital will go a long way to making sure we have the resources to supply the military in a timely manner."
CRY_risingstorm:0 "Rising Strom"
CRY_risingstorm_desc:0 "The Changelings dare to threaten our land and desecrate her ponies.

We would have to waste time building and developing all manner of tools solely for the purpose of construction! This is much more efficient."
CRY_mining:0 "Mining"
CRY_mining_desc:0 "There’s gold in them there suburbs! Black gold, that is, Appaloosan Tea. Some enterprising pony has turned their home into a refinery for petroleum and synthetic rubber after having struck a previously unknown vein of oil while excavating his basement.

CRY_medicine_focus_desc:0 "Crystal ponies are famous for their fragility, and while this might just be a hurtful stereotype it’s not hard to see where it came from.

Princess Cadance has called upon these valiant healers to lend their expertise to the military medical corp."
CRY_machinisation:0 "Mechanization"

CRY_crystals_desc:0 "One of the innovations to come out of Amethyst University is the discovery of a blue crystal that pulses with harmonic energy and can help repair buildings, along with keeping our soldiers cool in the desert and warm in the tundra. One scientist suggested the name Ragnite for it; another suggested Cadenzia, in honor of the princess. The name is still under review, but everypony agrees that this is only the beginning of what these crystals can do."
CRY_eqsforces:0 "Expeditionary Forces"
CRY_eqsforces_desc:0 "The external threats can no longer be ignored. While we’re doing our best to arm ourselves, it’s painfully clear that we require more brigades to guard the borders. There are eager volunteers over in Equestria, why not ask Princess Celestia to send them to us."
CRY_eqsadvisors:0 "Equestrian Military Staff"
CRY_eqsadvisors_desc:0 "Calling upon the Equestrian military to help train our forces may seem counter to the wishes of many of our subjects, but we would be fools not to learn from their expertise."

CRY_independence_referendum:0 "Referendum for Independence"
CRY_independence_referendum_desc:0 "As much as we’ve come to depend upon Equestria, there is a national spirit among our people that cannot be quelled. The calls for a severing of Equestrian Dominion over the Empire have grown in volume. In order to placate both the nationalists and Equestria, Princess Cadence will call for a vote on the issue."

CRY_welfare:0 "Ponies Act"
CRY_somtories:0 "Factories"
CRY_somtories_desc:0 "I must expand my production capactity. I cannot rely on bodies alone anymore. The hordes of mindless drones, hidden in armor and given a direction to charge, will no longer do. I must modernize my war machine."
CRY_somdarkcrystals:0 "Dark Crystals"
CRY_somdarkcrystals_desc:0 "My latest personal project. I leave the technology to others. But I will show the world that my magic is still to be feared. With my will behind them, not heat, not cold, not wind, not rain, not guns, not magic, not anything will stand up to my will!"
CRY_magic_of_proletariat:0 "Ponies' Magic"

CRY_crystallinganniversary_desc:0 "Our people hold a soft spot for Princess Cadence’s family, and her daughter, Flurry Heart, is no exception. A public celebration of Flurry’s birthday will doubtlessly draw large crowds and invaluable support."
CRY_equestriagames_desc:0 "The Equestria Games have long been a source of unity, good natured competition, and raucous entertainment for those on the continenta The time for this grand sporting event is once again fast approaching, and the Crystal Empire has been chosen as host. If we take the initiative in the planning, we will send a powerful message about our bond with Equestria."
CRY_umbrummilitia_desc:0 "Umbrum"
CRY_umbrumdefeat_desc:0 "Defeat of Umbrum"
CRY_military_desc:0 "The world is changing; military conflict is becoming ever more common and bloody. If the Crystal Empire is to survive then its military must be the best it can be, better even. Therefor CRYCOM has put forward a two year plan to increase the organizational skills of the army so that they may better defend the realm."
CRY_miamore_desc:0 "In spite of our efforts to draw us closer to Equestria, there is still doubt over the viability of our relationship with our southern neighbours. The Princess believes that she can win the hearts of the skeptics if she tells them her family’s story. Perhaps a book deal is in order?"
CRY_fame_desc:0 "Choose your way."
CRY_oldorder_desc:0 "The Crystal Empire has been gone for a millennia, and time has marched forwards without us. Despite what perceived slights that we may have suffered from them, Equestrians truly want to help us. In these trying times, it’s best that we stick close to Equestria."
CRY_fortifications_desc:0 "The lead Guard Engineer has been tasked with building a snow fort. To this end he requires his tools, and 120,000 laborers working around the clock for 720 days. Such demands will put a strain on our ability to commit to other political measures during this time, but the results are bound to be impressive."

CRY_naval_concern_decision_desc:0 "Now that we have secured our hold on Manehatten, it is time we make sure it gets put to good use."

cryscr.1.t:0 "Celebration is planned!"
cryscr.1.d:0 "Due to the economic problems the government could not support the tradition with an official celebration of the Winter Solstice holiday last year. However, undoubtedly the situation will change during this year. And we will hold a grand festival on the Winter Solstice day!"
cryscr.1.a:0 "Hurray!"
cryscr.2.t:0 "Flurry Heart birthday!"
cryscr.2.d:0 "The Flurry Heart is the baby princess of our current Princess, Mi Amore Cadenza. And today she is celebrating her second birthday! Congratulations to the happy family from all the ponies of our vast homeland, the Crystal Empire. Long live the Princesses!"
cryscr.2.a:0 "Yay!"
cryscr.3.t:0 "The Winter Solstice Celebration!"
cryscr.3.d:0 "One of many ancient tradition of the Crystal ponies is also celebrating the winter Solstice, when the sun is lowest on the horizon and the night is longest. In medieval times it was an important turn in the season, as it meant that the first half of the harsh crystalline winter was finally over and that brought everypony hope for a warm spring and the start of the sowing season. The celebration was attended by many crystal ponies and tourists from Equestria with yet another visit of the equestrian royalty."
cryscr.3.a:0 "Hurray!"
cryscr.3.t:0 "Preparations for Equestria Games"
cryscr.3.d:0 "Prepare for Equestrian Games!"
cryscr.3.a:0 "Hurray!"
cryscr.4.t:0 "Equestria Games Preparations!"
cryscr.4.d:0 "Celestia is planning to oraganize Equestria Games in Crystal City. It would be best to support this enterprise for our good, because events as such unite ponies and celebrate friendship among them."
cryscr.4.a:0 "Right."
cryscr.5.t:0 "Crystal Fair"
cryscr.5.d:0 "Crystal Fair is one of the oldest traditions of the Crystal Empire and it is shame that we have to ask permission and funds to hold the event from Equestria."
cryscr.5.a:0 "Send the proposal."

cryscr.9.t:0 "Story of Mi Amore Family"
cryscr.9.d:0 "A new biography of Princess Mi Amore Cadenza has hit bookstores this morning, and they have sold like hot cakes. The biography details her life, from her time as an orphaned Pegasus, to her ascension, to her marriage, and finally to her rule of the Crystal Empire. What is most surprising about the book is the candid nature of the writing: very little is kept private, and the words describe a sincere image of a kind family mare, warts and all.\n\nThe struggles depicted in the biography have renewed interest in the Royal Family among Crystal Ponies, leading to greater solidarity with the Mi Amore family and the Equestrian Crown."
cryscr.9.a:0 "Right."
cryscr.10.t:0 "Grand Festival"
cryscr.10.d:0 "Finally we held our first Grand Festival since the time elements of harmony banished Sombra! Thousand years ago, before the dissapearance of our empire, it was an annual holiday, where we showed the world products of our beautiful crafts: rigorously made crystals, durable armours, diamond-sharp swords! Now we are ready to show the world our strong tanks, precise rifles, swift aircrafts and magneficient goods!"
cryscr.10.a:0 "Hurray!"
cryscr.11.t:0 "A Group of Dissatisfied."
cryscr.11.d:0 "Rumors go across the Crystal City that there exists a group of ponies that support the old Sombra's regime. That is very unlikely, because there are still ponies that have lived under Sombra's tyrrany and horror of his enslavement lives in the hearts of the crystal ponies. Spectre of the past haunts the Crystal Empire."
cryscr.11.a:0 "Can't be true."
cryscr.12.t:0 "An interesting meet."
cryscr.12.d:0 "On one of the usual [GetMonth] day in the Crystal City you take a walk along one of the streets. You stop near a souvenir shop and glance at a poster with a pony in over-exaggerated, heavy chains and dark silhouette of King Sombra in the background. "May the tyranny never return in the Crystal lands" reads the writing. - Who would ever pin that in their room? - you wonder. Suddenly a young, pretty pony with light pink coloured fur and dark blue hair stops by you as you find yourself gazing over the poster and several figures of King Sombra. You turn to her to find she also stares at the things the store sells. - Wish he returns one day, - she says quietly. - What? - you ask. - Have you ever wondered, what would the Crystal Empire be like, if King Sombra returned? - she replied. You look at her, stunned. - Come join us to find out, - she says and puts a note into your hoof."
cryscr.12.a:0 "I need to take part in this."
cryscr.12.b:0 "Are you crazy?!"
cryscr.12.c:0 "I will support, without participating personally."
cryscr.13.t:0 "Interesting Development."
cryscr.13.d:0 "You're given an invitation to a club called "Stories of the Frost", as it says on the card. The description on the other side reads: "Join historical literature club of the Amethyst University. Tea, cookies and long talks about world history are granted! Topfloor, 37.". Sounds like fun, you think. The girl however, without long goodbyes, walks away, before you can ask anything else. On the other side of the invitation card you can see a detailed location the club."
cryscr.13.a:0 "I will have to check that out."
cryscr.13.b:0 "Not worth it, eh."
cryscr.14.t:0 "Forget it!"
cryscr.14.d:0 "You throw the invitation card away. Whirling in the light breeze, it falls down onto the pavement. - Are you serious? Why would you want that?! He destroyed our country! He... - you didn't finish, as the pony turned away, giving you a glance of scorn. You turn around and walk away, wishing to forget this incident."
cryscr.14.a:0 "These youngsters."
cryscr.15.t:0 "It's about time"
cryscr.15.d:0 "It's been a while since you met the pony girl near the souvenir shop. However up until now you kept the card and today, you finally had the time to follow the instructions that supposedly should lead you to the location of the club. As there was something alluring in that card, that girl and what she said that day. You took a walk through the streets and found yourself on the end of the suggested route. An ordinary, newly built aparment building was in front of you."
cryscr.15.a:0 "Right into the 37."
cryscr.15.b:0 "What am I doing?"
cryscr.16.t:0 "First Meeting."
cryscr.16.d:0 "You walk all the way to the top floor of the apartment building. Slowly taking the stairs in anticipation. After knocking on the wooden door, you are greeted by a stallion in an old, dusty magician robe. - Is this some kind of cosplay meeting? - you think. The stallion motions you to come in and closes the door after you enter. The apartment is illuminated only by pony magic, candles, luminous plants and crystals. Despite this terrible lighting system, you can distinguish a bunch of ponies on the couch, at the table and on the floor. Suddenly, the pony you met at the store comes up to you out of dark doorway, which as you suppose leads to the kitchen, - I was waiting! - exclaims she with excitement."
cryscr.16.a:0 "Oh, huh?"
cryscr.17.t:0 "The Club."
cryscr.17.d:0 "- Welcome to the history club! Hurray! - she cries joyfully. Everypony support her with a weary "Hurray". - We are studying magic, literature, history, politics and evolution science here, but most importantly, we are united by one idea: the Crystal Empire needs Sombra back!\n- What makes you think this is such a good thing? - you ask after a short silence. - Apparently, this guy never read a history book in his life, - remarks a colt from darkness. A wave of quiet giggling rolls in the room. - What do you know, that I don't? - you say. -Sit down, - says an old stallion, who was also wearing an antique magicians mantle."
cryscr.17.a:0 "Okie-dokie."
cryscr.17.b:0 "Why, though?"
cryscr.18.t:0 "The Stories of the Forst"
cryscr.18.d:0 "As you sit down around a coffee table with a flower emitting turquoise coloured light, the old pony begins his story.\n - I remember the King. I remember the times when the Crystal Empire was great and powerful, was really an Empire. The lands of the Yaks were under our control, the Northern Shores were our second home, and our border reached the eastern lands of deers. The Crystal Ponies were true masters of Equestria. The soil was rich, the grass was green, the empire thrived and the ponies were free. It was then the Equestrian Alicorn sisters started to become jealous of the greatness and power. Using their dark magic of the so-called Elements of Harmony, they imprisoned the king and all of the Crystal ponies in a place outside time and space for more than a thousand years. And now, the Crystal Empire is saucily stomped on by the sisters of Equestria and their puppet, unlawfully set-up princess Mi Amore Cadenza. Their greedy hooves take away all the treasures of the Crystal Empire, giving nothing in return. Thus we only see our future, and the future of the Crystal nation with return of King Sombra. With our help and his magic, we will bring the old Glory of the Crystal Empire back! - the stallion stopped and started coughing."
cryscr.18.a:0 "I see."
cryscr.19.t:0 "An Offer of the Lifetime"
cryscr.19.d:0 "For more than two hours the ponies narrated you the history of the Crystal Empire, the times when King Sombra ruled over the land. That he was wise, just and caring to the ponies. That the sisters envied his glory and majesty. All of this greatly differed from the equestrian narrative, but sounded so convincing and motivational.\n - We've been watching you for months, - says the old pony suddenly, - We know you want to help. We know, you want to aid King Sombra's escape from his shameful prison. The crystal ponies must rise against decay and opression. The time is perfect, frankly, as the stars align in the correct position only one time in five hundred years. It is the best time for strong reincarnation spells, just as we require. There is a way to bring King Sombra back, but we need your help! Together, we will change history of the Crystal Empire, and maybe the whole world, to better!"
cryscr.19.a:0 "Right."
cryscr.20.t:0 "The Decision"
cryscr.20.d:0 "You exit the apartment and walk home, reconsidering your life choices. You were offered to change history, are you really that powerful, do you really have the right to decide fate of millions of ponies? - The group believed that I'm one of them, but what if they really succeed, - you whisper, - Maybe I should report that to police while we've still got time? - Thinking about all that you lose track of time and route, endlessly wandering through the streets of the Crystal City. You get home late in the evening, sit down at the kitchen table and the decision strikes your head."
cryscr.20.a:0 "I have to join!"
cryscr.20.b:0 "This organization is a threat to peace and harmony!"
cryscr.20.c:0 "I'm not the one they're looking for."
cryscr.21.t:0 "Reported."
cryscr.21.d:0 "The next day you immediately go to the nearest police office and report everything that you've been told. The police squad takes a car and drives to the house, 37th flat. The special police unit breaks the door, the girl ponies in the room scream out of surpise. Some huge bouncer stallion tried to resist, but he policeponies knew their job. Everypony was seized and gunned down. As they're taken into the van, you notice the cream-pink pony being led with hoofcuffs, that is evident that she is terribly scared of what awaits her. Then she notices you in the crowd, her eyes round in shock. And you never asked her name. The doors are closed and the van drives off."
cryscr.21.a:0 "So be it."
cryscr.22.t:0 "The Return of Sombra."
cryscr.22.d:0 "You wake up from terrible noise and see a huge cloud of smoke. A sound of aircraft engines flying overhead is roaring in your ears. You take your stuff and get out on the street. The ponies are running around in panic. - Sombra has returned! - You hear somepony scream in the crowd. The cloud disappears and you can hear gunshots in distance. After several hours after you find yourself in a drafting centre, you're given a rifle and told to go on the street fight position. - Protect the Princess, Protect the Harmony, - exclaims the sergeant. Sombra's supporters are taking up arms. The return of Sombra has grown into a civil war. A civil war that Crystal Empire has never seen before. The club succeeded after all..."
cryscr.22.a:0 "No way."
cryscr.23.t:0 "Back to the Club"
cryscr.23.d:0 "After a while you are fully convinced that the return Sombra is essential for the better future of the Empire and its citizens. You hit the road to the club apartment where you now meet only four ponies. Sakira Bluebell, the pink-furred earthpony with dark blue mane and deep violet eyes. Dust Snowfall, the old earthpony stallion with pale-light ochre fur, long grizzle old pony's mane and never changing tired look on his face. Lake Frost, light-blue, nearly white unicorn with reflective dark-blue hair, the one who wore the magician's mantle before. And new to you, Red Peyote, a huge bouncer pony, with all way round musculature. It seemed only his horn didn't have any extra meat. - It is a pleasure to meet you, - said Snowfall, - We have been developing a plan how to bring King Sombra from limbo for months. Your assistance will be extremely helpful."
cryscr.23.a:0 "I'm in."
cryscr.24.t:0 "Knowledge of the elders"
cryscr.24.d:0 "In order to bring King Sombra back from his magical prison, we have to acquire an ancient rune, and a crystal heart charged with dark magic. With that we will be able to replace the Crystal Heart that creates the shield between the world of the living and the Limbo, imprisoning King Sombra. We know, that the secret of reincarnation spell and the formula to create the dark heart lies among the many scrolls and books in library of the Amethyst University. However, dark magic is strictly forbidden by law in the Empire and all ponies require highest authorization to access the Forbidden Section. We will have to reserve to extreme measures: enchant the librarians and guards. This is a dangerous enterprise, are you with us?"
cryscr.24.a:0 "That is why I'm here."
### rework
cryscr.25.t:0 "On the way"
cryscr.25.d:0 "On the next day you join up with Sakira on one of the central streets. She waves you from the other side and you hastely run across the street even though there are not that many cars at all. Almost like a stroll with a friend. Except the stroll is with a purpose of changing history. You chat with Sakira for a while during the walk, she gives you a glance on her life, she is a history student and always admired King Sombra, after the stories of Dust Snowfall she was decided for herself to do everything to make for King Sombra's return."
cryscr.25.a:0 "I see."
cryscr.26.t:0 "Entrance."
cryscr.26.d:0 "You join up with the second part of the group. Only Peyote, the bouncer stallion, wasn't there. A giant university library is in front of you. In silence, you go up the stairs. Inside, an old pony librarian greets you. They know the students and the old pony well. Every step and word echoes in the empty, silent, but charming halls. The only presense of life in here are student ponies, quietly reading their study books and whispering something to each other. You head to the center of the hall, then turn left, all the way to the wall, between the shelves, another turn to the left, some more turns, into a passway, and there it is, "The Forbidden Section". Two guards were playing chess on a coffee table near the door. The plan was enacted. Sakira went up to the guys and started a small talk with them. Meanwhile, using, it seemed, all his power, Lake casted a controlling spell on the stallions. Their eyes turned green and they returned their unfinished game, in oblivion, enchanted. - I practiced that for months, - sighed Lake and, using guards' keys, opened the door..."
cryscr.26.a:0 "Forward."
cryscr.27.t:0 "The Library"
cryscr.27.d:0 "You've spent three hours in the library. The ancient dusty books, although having heavy, monotone way of narration, were very useful in your studies. Most of the time you spent walking around the shelves, trying to find the required book, in the end, everypony gathered in center. - We need to hurry, the spell on those guards will soon unwind, - noted Dust. - Well, - you start, - as it turned out,  to construct the ominous dark heart, three things are required. First - basic crystal rocks, second - red umbrum crystal and third - time for the Dark Heart to grow. We will have to head to the Mountains, to caves near Snowybury or to the Umbrum Cage in order to find the crystals. The spell of growth that is used on plants may shorten the time of growth. - That is right, and we shall activate the Crystals around the city, too, fill them with magic, for it will make the reincarnation spell much stronger in the end, - added Dust. - Here's the pentagram that we will have to draw, before casting the spell."
cryscr.27.a:0 "Answers, finally!"
cryscr.30.t:0 "Hit the road"
cryscr.30.d:0 "You studied everything carefully many times together and the spiritual connection between you and other ponies became very strong. You were working hoof by hoof as partners, as friends. So it was time to go on a journey of searching crystals. But the destination was yet to be decided."
cryscr.30.a:0 "The Umbrum Cage"
cryscr.30.b:0 "Snowybury awaits!"
cryscr.31.t:0 "The Umbrum Cage"
cryscr.31.d:0 "On hooves you head south, to the hilly region of Umbrum Cage, that borders Neighgara high-grounds, called so for it used to contain a lot of umbrum crystals. Following the map you dispatch to one of the old mines. The whole region is abandoned, broken houses run wild with trees and plants, rusty cart ways. There wasn't any work going for centuries. When the Crystal Empire disappeared with King Sombra, this place did not. We're truly a nation of time travellers here. Finally, you arrive at the needed mine. - Are you sure, that there are crystals we need? - you say. - I've checked the old maps and books many times, - Lake replied, - This place has been abandoned since the disappearance of the Crystal Empire, and before that happened, the mines were active. Hundreds of years have passed, the place ought to be rich with crystals."
cryscr.31.a:0 "Alright then."
cryscr.32.t:0 "The Crystal Mountains"
cryscr.32.d:0 "The air near the mountains is cold and fresh. At the mountain foot was the town of Snowybury, one quite popular tourist destination for its location. Beautiful forests, waterfalls, healing springs, skiing resorts in winter attract many crystal ponies. The Crystal Empire is a truly wonderful country! The town itself is a very quiet, rural place and despite it being practically northernmost point of Equestria, cultivated fields are scattered all around. But you, and the group arrived here with a purpose."
cryscr.32.a:0 "Lovely place."
cryscr.33.t:0 "The Caves"
cryscr.33.d:0 "After a day spent checking out the landmarks, you finally head to the caves. Separated from a group of tourists, you sneak into a pass leading deep down into the mountain. - Are you sure we won't get lost? - asks Sakira, while you descend into darkness, illuminated only by Lake's magic and a small flashlight on Dust's head. It seems the temperature drops down with every step. In about a minute, the students are already shaking from cold, with each exhale there is a cloud of steam. The coldness of the mountain bites to the bone, you start to feel as if you had a sore throat. In several minutes of long climb-down, you don't feel your hooves. Suddenly, in the end of the tunnel, you see light of crystals. Everypony hastens their pace. You come out into a big grotto with a clean, pure underground lake, surrounded by many crystals of various colours, some of them are radiating light. The main source of the sky-blue light, however, is the lake itself and the crystals on its bottom. In center of the reservoir, surrounded by hundreds of blue crystals one red, umbrum crystal is perfectly seen through the still water of the lake."
cryscr.33.a:0 "There it is."
cryscr.34.t:0 "Red Crystal"
cryscr.34.d:0 "- Let's get this over with, - you say. Sakira takes a hammer and starts searching for a good ordinary crystal, - Lake, can you take out the red crystal? I think we need to get out of here before we all freeze to death. - I can try, - Lake replied, noticeably shaking. The pony stepped closer to the lake, his horn flashed with light, magic wrapped the crystal at the bottom. Nothing. Stallion clenched his teeth, the magic aura around his horn significantly brightened, his legs began to shake. Didn't help. Lake fell on the ground, fainted, it seemed. - Sweet Celestia, - you whisper. - One of us will have to dive, - said Dust, - Unicorn magic should be of a very advanced level to be able to split a crystal. The use of force, however, will do the trick."
cryscr.34.a:0 "I will."
cryscr.34.b:0 "Sakira."
cryscr.34.c:0 "Dust, you're experienced."
cryscr.34.e:0 "Sakira, let's do it together."
cryscr.35.t:0 "Deep water"
cryscr.35.d:0 "- I will, - you say, - I can do it. Sakira, give me the hammer, let's finish with this. - O-okay, - agrees Sakira reluctantly and hoofs you the hammer she broke other crystals with. You take the tool, stare into the water and without further ado, jump in. The water is so endlessly cold, it burns. You try to dive to the bottom as fast you can, the pressure increases, it's hard to move. In seconds that took ages, you find yourself in a meter before the glowing red crystal. Swing of the hammer. A deep knock echoes in water. Another one. And another. As spasm and convulsions take over your back hooves, pain takes over. One more swing. One more. Crack, at last the red crystalline falls down. You grab the beautiful thing with both hooves and, pushing off from the bottom of the lake, reach for air, leaving the hammer in the lake forever. About to faint as well, you think, - What a team we are...."
cryscr.35.a:0 "..."
cryscr.36.t:0 "Red and pink"
cryscr.36.d:0 "- W-why me? I-I'm scared, - Sakira looks at you and Dust in shock. - I can't even swim, - you say. - You need to do it for Sombra! The future of the Crystal Empire might depend on you right now, we won't be able to come back here. - You... You're right, - she breaths unevenly, but tries to control it. - You put a hoof on her back, you can do it. - For the greater good of all crystal ponies, - she says, dedicated to her cause, and takes the hammer into her mouth. Jump. Splash. She swims very well apparently. "I wonder what the water is like", you think, but not dare to examine it. After a long minute of wait, Sakira appears on the surface, coughing. You and Dust jump to the brink to help her out. When you touch her, she's ice cold, shaking uncontrollably, but the red crystal is with her."
cryscr.36.a:0 "Well done."
cryscr.37.t:0 "Old pony's job"
cryscr.37.d:0 "- Move, youngsters, - Dust takes off his mantle without persuasion. He is undoubtedly a very experienced old pony. And he is ready to do anything what it takes for the hope of King Sombra's return. He takes Sakira's hammer into his mouth and jumps into the lake. You exchange hopeful glances with Sakira. Dust's swimming pace is rather slow. "I wonder what the water is like", you think, but not dare to examine it. After a minute of waiting, Dust appears on the surface, you and Sakira quickly run to the brink to help him. He doesn't look concerned or exhausted, feels like nothing gets the old pony. But most importantly, the umbrum crystal is here."
cryscr.37.a:0 "Good job."
cryscr.38.t:0 "Freeze together"
cryscr.38.d:0 "- Sakira, it will be easier to do it together, we can break the crystal and help each other swim. Morally, it will be easier to both of us. Because we are stronger together, - you explain, staring at her, - Uh, oh..., - she sighs, - Okay... Let's do it for the better future of the country. Both of you sigh. Step on the brink and after exchanging glances, jump into the lake. The water is so cold, it burns. Struggling, you hold hooves with the pony and swim to the crystal. It's becoming harder to move, as the pressure is increasing. As you approached the crystalline, you grab it with both hooves and try to pull it, while Sakira is trying to break it with the hammer. Hit after hit, seconds pass like minutes in this unknown frozen lake. Finally, the crystal breaks and you quickly jump to the surface, taking Sakira by hoof. All freezing and shaking, the job's done."
cryscr.38.a:0 "Made it."
cryscr.39.t:0 "Umbrum Retrieved."
cryscr.39.d_player:0 "With great trouble you and the group climb back from the caves, exhausted and frozen, but victorious. As the crystal has been found and retrieved, It is time to change history. Striving to stand on your frostbitten hooves, you require assistance to walk. You get back to Snowybury and spend a night in the hotel. You start to feel very sick, from time to time you burst in terrible cough. Sakira tries to take care of you, bringing you hot tea and medicine, changing your clothes as you sweat. Will I recover at all, you think to yourself."
cryscr.39.d_sakira:0 "With great trouble you and the group climb back from the caves, exhausted  and frozen, but victorious. As the crystal has been found and retrieved, It is time to change history. Striving to stand on her frostbitten hooves, Sakira needed assistance to walk. You get back to the hotel in Snowybury and spend a night there. Everypony needed rest, especially Sakira who caught a serious cold while swimming. You try to help in any way, by bringing tea and medicine to her bed. Between terrible coughing scenes, she smiles in sick delirium and ensures everypony around her that this is all fine, she is as close to achieving her goal as she'd ever been, and she is happy."
cryscr.39.d_dust:0 "With great trouble you and the group climb back from the caves, exhausted and frozen, but victorious. As the crystal has been found and retrieved, It is time to change history. Things are going rather great. However, when you get back to the hotel room to get deserved rest, it appears that the good old Dust Snowfall is starting to feel dizzy and sick. The age made itself felt. He got high temperature and cough. Three of you try to do everything to help the pony, but it is obvious that he requires professional medical treatment."
cryscr.39.d_sakira_and_player:0 "With great trouble you and the group climb back from the caves, exhausted and frozen, but victorious. As the crystal has been found and retrieved, It is time to change history. Striving to stand on her frostbitten hooves, you and Sakira needed assistance to walk. With Dust having to help Lake, you had to keep going together, supporting each other. By the time you arrive at the hotel room, it is apparent that Sakira and you caught a cold, while swimming in that lake. - We did what we must have done, - you say to grumpy Dust's remarks. Both of you had to spend a rough night of dizziness, fever and cough. That's obvious that you will require medical inspection, when you arrive back in the Crystal City."
cryscr.39.a:0 "Here's an end to this journey at least."
cryscr.39.b:0 "Poor girl."

As you go to look for a good place, you suddenly hear voices in there. You look inside through a hole in the wall. The house doesn't have a roof and inside of it, everything is covered in lush plants, grass and flowers, and a dogrose bush. In centre, on what appears to be the fallen roof, two foals are playing with sticks and dolls. When they notice you, they back off, scared."

You ask them about questions about King Sombra. - My parents told me that he enslaved everypony, and there was no friendship or harmony when he was her, - says the colt, - Celestia and Luna freed us from him. We are free now\n-What if they're wrong?\n-We need Sombra back to find out, - he laughs. - Anyway, we should go to our village, the sun is coming down.\nThat night you spend with little sleep, thinking over and over again, who is King Sombra, what will he really do, how will the ponies react to his ressurection... The cear sky was all glimmering with beautiful stars."

They ran away, - you look apologetic, - You shouldn't have screamed like that, good heavens, - Sakira rolls her eyes. - Scared the foals. You set up a camp in the house.

cryscr.44.d:0 "In the morning, after a short breakfast, cooked by Sakira. You decide to try your luck in the mines and search for something valuable. After looking around, you stumble upon a shaft, closed by remnants of large wooden door. The looks of the tunnel were not inviting whatsoever, it was rather creepy. The grass did not grow any farther from the door. It seems that the whole place is an entrance to the underworld. - There's nothing to do about it, - says Lake and lights his horn, - Don't hesitate, hesitation and doubt are just waste of time. He turns away and goes inside."
cryscr.44.a:0 "Here we go."
cryscr.45.t:0 "Old Gates"
cryscr.45.d:0 "The tunnel is very dark, now only unicorn's magic and flashlight on Dust's head led you through. Here and there, you can see rusty remnants of pickaxes, shovels and other equipment. This place wasn't touched since the very disappearance of the Crystal Empire. Every tool looked medieval, ancient. There weren't any rails, as on the pictures of mines in San Palomino Desert. After a good hour of walk in cold, wet, stuffy air of the shaft, turning every now and then according to Lake's map, you stumble upon a door, which was not marked the map. - I can sense a magical barrier on this door, - says Lake and knocks it with his hoof."
cryscr.45.a:0 "What's with that?"
cryscr.46.t:0 "The Barrier"
cryscr.46.d:0 "- I have to try to break it, - says Lake, his horn begins to glow brighter. The light aura also concentrates around the door. Sparks start to rain out of it.

Lake screams."
cryscr.46.a:0 "Ah."
cryscr.47.t:0 "Treasures"
cryscr.47.d:0 "The door vanished. Lake stood and rubbed his eyes. When the cloud disappeared, everypony stood in awe. Thousands of crystals of different kinds and shapes are in front of you, umbrum crystals, gems, precious stones, many of them. - This is great, - exclaims Dust. - Are you alright?, - Sakira asks Lake. - Y-yes, it's okay, just something got in my eyes when the door exploded, - he replies.\nYou break the crystals that you need to grow the dark heart and head back home."
cryscr.47.a:0 "Well, that went better than expected."
cryscr.48.t:0 "Crystal Dark Energy"
cryscr.48.d:0 "You decide to take your time and charge the crystals scattered around the City with dark magic. Lake and Dust teach you to control your magic power through a magical staff. - Remember, magic lives in all of us, in all ponies, some of us need certain help to control it. After several days of hard practice you learn one spell, that takes part of your mana and transforms into dark energy. With that, the group takes you to fill the crystallines, as said in the books it will create an additional layer of force to support the reincarnation spell."

However, well-organized vanguard of the supporters do not allow anypony to the palace. This enterprise will start to look too suspicious for the government to use army, we need to act fast. You remove the Crystal Heart and throw the Dark Heart in its place. Immediately, giant storm clouds appear in the sky, blocking the moon out. You stand in a circle around the heart, and start chanting the spell. The crowd supports you.

Brightest than ever lightnings strike the ground and light everything up as during day time. Suddenly, everything turns black. Ghostly shadows are passing by. Explotion, thunder, earth shakens...

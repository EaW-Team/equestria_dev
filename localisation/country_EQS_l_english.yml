 EQS_bat_econ_reform_1_desc:0 "Celestia and Luna have launched a large-scale program to integrate the thestral economy into Equestria's, cracking down on thestral exploitation in the job market, ensuring their companies are brought up to compliance with Equestrian laws and are given aid in finding their place in this new economy. Productivity has dropped sharply as businesses rush to adjust."
 EQS_bat_econ_reform_2:0 "Incorporating the Thestral Economy "
 EQS_bat_econ_reform_2_desc:0 "Celestia and Luna have implemented some reforms to give the thestral economy a chance to integrate into Equestrian society as well as cracking down on those cases of thestral exploitation that have been found. Productivity is reduced as businesses are adapting."
EQS_bat_extremism_1:0 "Calming Ponies"
 EQS_bat_extremism_1_desc:0 "Celestia and Luna have launched a large campaign to make ponies more accepting of thestral integration, dispelling false rumours and assuring them that batponies are harmless."

 EQS_bat_pr_campaign_2_desc:0 "Princess Twilight Sparkle has launched an initiative to promote thestral-pony friendship. The campaign is moderate in size, including visits by the Wielders of the Elements, friendship clubs and thestral students being invited to the School of Friendship."
 EQS_bat_pony_divide_1:0 "The Forgotten Tribe"
 EQS_bat_pony_divide_1_desc:0 "Equestria is the land of the Three Tribes - Earth Ponies, Pegasi, and Unicorns. Yet there is a fourth tribe - the Thestrals (batponies). Living in the many mountains, caves and hidden places of Equestria, thestrals live largely separated from mainstream society, which is an ancient schism from the days of Nightmare Moon. Should war come, as unlikely as it is, the loyalty of the thestrals cannot be guaranteed."
 EQS_bat_pony_divide_2:0 "The Forgotten Tribe"
 EQS_bat_pony_divide_2_desc:0 "Equestria has become more welcoming to thestrals. Even if systemic reform remains out of reach, the word of Canterlot and the Princesses remains powerful, and tensions have eased slightly."

 EQS_moonshine_partisans_3:0 "Uncontested Lunar Guerrillas"
 EQS_moonshine_partisans_3_desc:0 "Purple Heart's troops failed to warn us in time, leaving our rear lines vulnerable to guerrilla attack by cultists and Lunar loyalists. We will suffer harassment and poor supply conditions for some time."

 equestria.1.t:0 "Happy Hearth's Warming and Happy New Year!"
 equestria.1.d:0 "Several days ago ponies across the country celebrated Hearth's Warming, an annual holiday commemorating the founding of Equestria. As is tradition, on Heart's Warming Eve ponies gathered to spectate theatre plays that re-enact the legendary establishment of the country, with the pageant in Canterlot being the largest. In the story, the three pony tribes, Unicorns, Pegasi and Earth ponies, live an uneasy existence together until a fearsome blizzard forces them to seek for a new homeland. However, the leaders of the tribes all claim the same land and argue with one another, causing the blizzard to appear again. According to the legend, the cold was caused by magical Windigos that feed on hatred. The tribal leaders are frozen in ice, but their assistants befriend one another and create the Fire of Friendship, a heart-shaped flame that expels the Windigos forever and melts the bodies and hearts of the tribal leaders. The three tribes then agree to share the new land, calling it Equestria. After the pageants, on Hearth's Warming Day, pony families enjoy delicious meals, exchange gifts and raise the flag of Equestria.\n\nAnd now, the new year has come. Everypony on the streets are sharing an optimistic view on the future and wishing all strangers a happy new year, because nobody is actually a stranger in Equestria. The Princesses have given their traditional speech to the public as well, rejuvenating the spirit of Harmony and Unity throughout all of Equestria. No matter what will happen, the ponies know that as long as they work together, they can overcome any challenge."
 equestria.1.a:0 "The future looks bright."
 equestria.2.t:0 "Buffalo Problem"
 equestria.2.d:0 "Pinkie Pie, the Element of Laughter has volunteered to go to the Buffalo as an envoy to broker an agreement between Equestria and the Buffalo. However, the risk of going alone into what probably qualifies as something close to hostile territory has given several senior military officers pause and they have directly petitioned the Crown to instead greenlight a full military 'intervention' to the Buffalo to end the problem once and for all. However, despite the Dotted Line Report, the optics of the Royal Guard engaging in what qualifies as an illegal occupation would give even the most hardened militarist in Equestria pause.\n\nOf course, while a full military occupation and invasion would definitively solve the problem of the Buffalo once and for all, even at the cost of losing the moral high ground, an envoy opens the door to both peaceful coexistence and maybe even the integration of the buffalo into Equestria itself. There's just one problem with an envoy and diplomatic propositions and pressure. The Buffalos could always end up rejecting our advances which would leave us out of options, out of a solution and out of a good image. But ultimately, a solution must be taken. What should be our course of action?"
 equestria.2.a:0 "Send the envoy. Such militaristic rhetoric does not have a place in our nation."
 equestria.2.b:0 "Start the engines, let's get this over with."
 equestria.3.t:0 "The Dotted Line Report"
 equestria.3.d:0 "A disturbing report has recently landed on the desk of Princess Celestia. Commissioned by the small bureaucracy, it has painted a grim picture of what would happen, were Equestria to find herself attacked by any enemies from beyond her borders.\n\nThe first part of the report focuses on Stalliongrad. While they have not been particularly keen on jumping across the border, whatever the rhetoric coming out of the Palace of Soviets says, were it to happen, the Royal Guard, with its less than 10,000 soldiers in the area would find itself swept away by the Red Army which, the report reckons would get as far as Albion and Trotsylvania before moving to threaten Manehatten.\n\nSpeaking of the Royal Guard, the report condemns the large cuts made to the Royal Guard over the recent years, blaming them for the near-defeat at Canterlot, using very unparliamentary language to describe the state of the Guard, recommending an immediate five-fold increase in budget.\n\nLastly, there's the biggest, and grimmest part of the report. The Changelings. Information is of course rare about them, and as such, the report makes it clear it's working off hearsay. But, this is the most damning part of it all. The report states that if a full Changeling invasion was to occur, Equestria would surely fall within two years of such an invasion, unless 'radical and controversial' measures were taken, including overhauling the whole state to mobilize all resources.\n\nIn addition, the lack of adoption of modern methods and education is also mentioned as being a severe deficit, with the EEA and industry being mentioned as the core problems.\n\nNevertheless, despite the warnings made in the report regarding the risk of invasion, only the industrial and scientific parts of the report has been stated to be put into effect."
 equestria.3.a:0 "This is a wake up call."
 equestria.4.t:0 "The Expansion of the School for Gifted Unicorns"
 equestria.4.d:0 "It tended to be in the past that only those who could pull favours, had a lot of connection or were just plain lucky could attend the School for Gifted Unicorns. But no more is that the case. The cash injection that has been performed by the Crown has been immensely helpful in broadening the appeal and fields of the School for Gifted Unicorn. Having moved most of the facilities from the older, historical, if cramped quarters in the core of Canterlot to a more modernized place in the outskirts of Canterlot, the new sprawling campus will be able to more adequately handle the many breakthroughs and inventions that are being pumped out of Equestria's scientific community. Many of the new students and faculty have been some of Griffonia's brightest that have fled the political turmoil in Wingbardy and some parts of the Empire for more fertile lands. They have certainly found them here in Equestria."
 equestria.4.d_sol:0 "In the past, it was all too often of an occurrence, that those of rich families simply used their family wealth to buy their foal a place in the school. Often this lead to students not valuing the opportunity to study there and as such lowered quality of the graduates. Furthermore, it has let moral rot seep into our society ever so slightly. This sets an undesirable precedent that our Empress can no longer tolerate. Today Her Imperial Majesty agreed to a proposal to fund the School for Gifted Unicorns from Imperial Treasury directly in form of annual cash injections. These new funds will be used to refurbish classrooms and other school facilities, as well as better equipment and supplies. This also gives the Crown more power and control over the curriculum of the school. Starting this semester, the school will besides be focusing on magic also teach religious and moral values. This will ensure that the next generation will grow into upstanding model citizens of society."
 equestria.4.a:0 "Wonderful."
 equestria.5.t:0 "Luna Nova Academy"
 equestria.5.d:0 "Today, what was once a pipe dream in the minds of the researchers of the Luna Nova Academy has been made reality. Made possible with the massive injection of funds from the Crown, the Luna Nova Academy has moved from its older campus to the newer, more modern magically-powered campus. Housed in the old clocktower outside of Ponyville, the laboratories and study halls stretch deep underground, with several testing areas housed both above and below ground. With the new facilities, several old inventions which had been put in mothballs by lack of funds, facilities or both have been pulled out and begun field testing, and depending on what is chosen at the highest level, may see full-scale deployment within the year.\n\nIt is expected that the institution's patron, HM Princess Luna will make a visit to the place in the very near future."
 equestria.5.t_sol:0 "Sol Invicta Academy"
 equestria.5.d_sol:0 "Our most prestigious school, now renamed to a name more fitting of its status, has received the subsidies from Her Imperial Majesty. With these, they will be able to refurbish labs with new state-of-the-art equipment, increase the number of professors and their salaries as well as opening more places for talented ponies in [Root.GetName], who might have been dismissed due to capacity issues otherwise. Academy dormitories will also get its due expansions and renovations to make sure these students have a place to live and improve living standards. Lastly, Her Imperial Majesty did not make any demands per se. However, during her meeting with the Dean, she expressed her 'strong' desire to see more focus on magical theory and practice to raise better mages, not to forget the emphasis she made regarding technology, chemistry, physics and other natural sciences as well as focus on religious and ethical upbringing."
 equestria.5.a:0 "Here's to many successful inventions."
 equestria.6.t:0 "Public Schools Funding"
 equestria.6.d:0 "Even with the strengthening of higher learning, we must all remember that the ABC's and 123's come first. The overhaul of the public school system in Equestria has been long overdue, still teaching subjects and topics that have been mentioned as being outdated 'when Coltlumbus made landfall in New Mareland'. Hyperbole, to be sure, but a damning indictment of the state of education nonetheless before our reforms. The recent reform package that we have just rolled out into the school system has provided for a good and modern education for the fillies and colts of Equestria. When they go forth and receive new education, they will carry with them a new world in their hearts."
 equestria.6.a:0 "Wisdom is power, my little ponies."
 equestria.7.t:0 "The Formation of the Urgent War Committee"
 equestria.7.d:0 "With the Dotted Line Report being dusted off and now urgently read and studied with tensions rising both at home and abroad, Princess Celestia has ordered the formation of a committee to prepare for the storm ahead. While it is by no means certain that something will ever come of it, the Cabinet and several other prominent ponies with roles to play in an hypothetical war have secretly been recalled to Canterlot in order to draw up plans. Time of the essence, as a war has been judged to be near-forthcoming and if the predictions in the Dotted Line Report are to be avoided, then Equestria must truly take radical and controversial measures to survive the storm ahead.\n\nThree separate lines of development are to be taken. To reform  the bureaucracy and political system, to renovate the military and to reach out to form a broad coalition of ponies and creatures, whatever creed they may subscribe to."
 equestria.7.a:0 "Great progress."
 equestria.8.t:0 "The Expansion of the War Council"
 equestria.8.d:0 "The War Council of Equestria has over the past many years been starved and gutted of funding and aid from the Crown due to the peaceful era that Equestria has experienced. But storm clouds have been gathering over the last five years and we can no longer afford to ignore the defence of the realm. The War Council has been expanded with several new ponies with relevant experience which shall serve as some of the top advisors to Princess Celestia for the time being. While some protests have been recorded amongst the established hierarchy as 'usurping the traditional levers of power', in public, all agree that it has been a necessary step if Equestria is to survive the storm ahead.\n\nSeveral high-ranking military officers have been slated to join the Council in the near future, should the Crown call upon them."
 equestria.8.a:0 "Fight we must."
 equestria.9.t:0 "An Appeal to Stalliongrad"
 equestria.9.d:0 "With the war becoming ever more costly by the day, we must appeal for help from outside of Equestria and our nearest friends. With Queen Chrysalis on a hate-fuelled crusade to dominate and carve up all of Equus, all of ponykind is on the line. We must either hang together, or we will deservedly hang separately. Even if it will cost us, and will pain us to do so, we must go to Stalliongrad and ask them for help in this fight for life or death that we are embroiled in.\n\nHowever, there is a vocal wing in the War Council that advocate not selling out thousands of ponies to live under Stalliongrad when it is very well possible that we can defeat the changelings ourselves. The choice of action has thusly ultimately fallen to the Crown. We can choose to ask, knowing that there will be a price, or we can bet on us being able to defeat the changelings by ourselves."
 equestria.9.a:0 "Please send help."
 equestria.9.b:0 "We can manage on our own.."
 equestria.10.t:0 "Stalliongrad accepts our proposal"
 equestria.10.d:0 "We have received word back from Stalliongrad through the intermediaries that we originally sent the message through. For now, they have agreed to our offer and thusly, we have pulled out of the region. With the conclusion of the temporary alliance for now, Stalliongradian reinforcements, consisting of what has been rumoured in certain diplomatic circles to be the bulk of the Red Army has boarded trains and is being hastened to the front. While they may be lesser in number, they are rested and ready for a fight."
 equestria.10.a:0 "Friendship IS Magic!"
 equestria.11.t:0 "Diplomatic Shelter"
 equestria.11.d:0 "The rightful Queen of Olenia, Queen Velvet, for many years in exile in various countries around the world today arrived in Equestria on the ship HMS Canterlot. She was given a heroine's welcome in the city of Vanhoover, the largest Olenian community outside of the Kingdom proper. The city had long been a hotbed for resistance against Johan, both Legitimists favouring the restoration of Queen Velvet and communists favouring a restructuring along the lines of Stalliongrad. Common for both, however, is that she has long been a focal point for resistance against Johan, whatever their creed may be. Of course that is where the similarities end, but that's a matter for another time.\n\nQueen Velvet has settled nicely into Vanhoover, having already begun advocating that Equestria should intervene in Olenia to restore 'rightful rule' to Olenia."
 equestria.11.a:0 "Care for tea, Velvet?"
 equestria.12.t:0 "Accession of the Buffalo State"
 equestria.12.d:0 "Today, the Buffalo have been integrated into Equestria as an 'autonomous region' where the Buffalo are to retain their own rules and tribes, but will have some restrictions placed upon them by Equestria, for example, the traditional use of geckos will not be allowed. In exchange, however, funding and other securities for the Buffalo will flood into their region. Some of this includes the oil fields and iron mines below the Buffalo region which Equestrian prospectors have been very eager to open up. With the strong guarantees by the Crown, this treaty is sure to give dividends for all."
 equestria.12.a:0 "That's a new one."
 equestria.13.t:0 "Slowly Recovering"
 equestria.13.d:0 "With the reforms and renovations of the political system, we are receiving reports that the conversion of the economy to a war-ready footing is making good progress. Wide-ranging changes are taking places in Equestria, with older methods and practices quickly being phased out in favour of the newer, more effective methods of work. The bureaucracy too is changing at a hasty pace, with legions of newly minted clerks delivering an effective and centralized governance from Canterlot. Even then, large amounts of institutional resistance to the reforms and the new systems remain within both the Civil Service as well as amongst private actors.."
 equestria.13.a:0 "Now that's good news."
 equestria.14.t:0 "Magical Nuclear Weapons"
 equestria.14.d:0 "With the war dragging on, our scientists have begun working on something that might break the impasse at the front. Based upon the theories of magical annihilation and the failed megaspells, the magi-nuclear principle would be able to harness all of the raw magical power inherent in the crystals used and unleash it by having it undergo an explosive, nuclear fission. Not all crystals can be used, and even then, massive amounts of raw magical power will need to be packed into any one device. But should we be able to produce such a weapon, it would be one of the most powerful and fearsome weapons ever created."
 equestria.14.a:0 "It is regrettable we must push this far for victory."
 equestria.15.t:0 "Stalliongrad Declines Research Agreement" #Seems not to fire in normal play.
 equestria.15.d:0 "Stalliongradian authorities have rejected our offer of joint research. Talk about international friendship."
 equestria.15.a:0 "Oh well..."
 equestria.16.t:0 "Almost Recovered"
 equestria.16.d:0 "The second set of reforms pushed through has changed Equestria for good. The reforms, eradicating bloat where it can be found and establishing several new departments for the purpose of reorganizing Equestria into a modern state with a modern state apparatus, rather than a modern state with an obsolete bureaucracy. The factories are reporting ever higher production numbers, the Crown ever higher tax income. Indeed, Equestria is about to finally jump into a new era of governance. No longer is it a loose group of advisors that advice the Crown, but rather a set Cabinet that are appointed by the monarchs with specific portfolios."
 equestria.16.a:0 "Good."
 equestria.17.t:0 "Stalliongrad accepts research agreement" #Seems not to fire in normal play.
 equestria.17.d:0 "Stalliongradian authorities have accepted our offer of joint research. Together for Victory!"
 equestria.17.a:0 "Sweet."
 equestria.18.t:0 "Dragons Decline Ceding of Badlands"
 equestria.18.d:0 "Dragons declined to cede Badlands, despite the land being too isolated to be of any effective use to them. Dragon Lord Ember decided to listen to her people pressuring her to decline our demand. It seems we have underestimated the length to which the Harmonic sympathies of Dragon Lord Ember run. We should rethink our options on how to deal with the issue, even if they will end up being controversial on the home front."
 equestria.18.a:0 "We'll see."
 equestria.19.t:0 "Dragons Accept"
 equestria.19.d:0 "Most excellent news arrived at [Root.capital.GetName] today. It seems Dragon Lord Ember has wisely chosen to cede the Badlands to us. This will be beneficial to our southern territories (and for the mapmakers). Our little ponies will no longer have to live in worry over dragons migrating to and from the Badlands and scorching the land in the process. Perhaps excavation missions wouldn't be a bad idea either, after all, the volcanic ground and rock often can be rich in minerals."
 equestria.19.a:0 "We are very grateful."
 equestria.20.t:0 "Dragons Accept on Second Attempt"
 equestria.20.d:0 "It seems that sending Spike to deal with this issue wasn't the wrong idea. After a few days of thorough negotiations, he has returned from Dragon Isles with news of success. We don't know how he managed to persuade the Dragon Lord, however, we were right to pick him for this task. Whatever his method of persuasion, he has managed to bring some very convincing arguments to the table. With this issue over, peace can return to the Southeast and maybe this can be a new beginning for us and dragons."
 equestria.20.a:0 "Excellent work, Spike."
 equestria.21.t:0 "Dragons Want War?"
 equestria.21.d:0 "It seems the dragons felt insulted by our demand to cede Badlands. We have received a message by dragonfire saying that they will never cede Badlands peacefully. Almost immediately after, we received more reports of dragons strafing fields and villages in the Southeast. Of course, we were aware of their often so violent, uncouth and warlike minds, however, we didn't think they would go this far. To risk war over such an issue is simply unreasonable and in fact controversial by traditional morals. Perhaps ponies and dragons are too different after all to coexist peacefully. Yet if they want to do it this way, we will have to put an end to their raids by the only thing they seem to understand."
 equestria.21.a:0 "Peace, through war."
 equestria.22.t:0 "New Generals in the Military Staff"
 equestria.22.d:0 "While we may believe in peace, friendship and harmony, we must recognize that we can't ignore our military. Our ideals must be fought for. Indeed, if we want to live peacefully, we must be ready to defend that peace. The Dotted Line Report made that very clear to us. But in this world, our current officer corps is not sufficient. If we find ourselves in a situation where we need to fight for our ideals, fight for harmony, we must be ready to meet that challenge. While we may have ponies like Prince Blueblood, or our rising star, Soarin, we must expand. While it may have been a strange measure, several of the Elements of Harmony, their friends and several other ponies have been reckoned to be prospective general officers and stand ready to serve their homeland in this time of need."
 equestria.22.a:0 "Let us hope they can cooperate."
 equestria.25.t:0 "Dictatorship of Proletariat" #dummied out
 equestria.25.d:0 "We've successfully seized the power in the country. It is time for us to seize the means of production and make the economy work for the people."
 equestria.25.a:0 "Yes."
 equestria.26.t:0 "Protection of the Homeland"
 equestria.26.d:0 "The Magic of Friendship was an important defining part of our ideals for a long time. It is almost unimaginable to give it up. It helped and carried us through so many dangerous situations. It helped us to understand those we once called villains and even help them begin their lives anew, like Starlight Glimmer, Princess Luna and Trixie. Yet this world is becoming increasingly more dangerous as the time fades. Our homeland and our ideals are under attack. As regrettable as it may be, we can no longer afford to follow the Magic of Friendship. We must steel ourselves, and harden our hearts and chests as hard as diamond.\n\nFor we must remember what we are fighting for. That we are defending all the innocent or weak who cannot defend themselves, and if we were to lose they would be the ones to suffer the most. Yes, this is our resolution and we must stand proud and firm in defence of harmony."
 equestria.26.a:0 "A necessary measure."
 equestria.31.t:0 "Stalliongradian Propaganda Campaign"
 equestria.31.d:0 "Recently, our intelligence officers have been alarmed by an increased number of Stalliongradian agents spreading their propaganda among our people. While we generally stand for the free exchange of ideas between ponies and don't interfere with what ideas our ponies talk about as long as they don't pose a direct threat to our nation and way of life, perhaps we ought to take a different approach this time and crack down on them. While we do not know what consequences our decision may have on the populace, we shouldn't make our decision lightly."
 equestria.31.a:0 "Crush them!"
 equestria.31.b:0 "Let them stay."
 equestria.32.t:0 "Stalliongrad Sends Infiltrators"
 equestria.32.d:0 "Our intelligence agents have managed to uncover a trail of evidence which led them to the conclusion that Stalliongrad had been infiltrating our society. They are spreading propaganda material among our little ponies and riling up the masses for their own devious end. We can only imagine the reason for this at the moment. Are they simply going to spread propaganda? Are they going to spy on us? Are they perhaps trying to instigate disobedience or the stars forbid a civil war? We need to decide how to deal with this issue quickly."
 equestria.32.a:0 "Crush them!"
 equestria.32.b:0 "Let them stay."
 equestria.34.t:0 "Left Rallies" #dummied out
 equestria.34.d:0 "Many big cities saw communists, socialists, workers and sympathisers going on the solidarity march through the major streets. The event is dedicated to the Labour Day celebrated on 1st of May. These ponies say that they share their solidarity with all the oppressed working class creatures of the world."
 equestria.34.a:0 "Let them be."
 equestria.34.b:0 "Crush the demonstration!"
 equestria.35.t:0 "Communist Activity" #dummied out
 equestria.35.d:0 "After the socialist ponies were chased down by the Royal Guards during the Labour Day demonstration, political views of the left-wing ponies turned drastically radical. Many communist newspapers were founded, many communists conduct propaganda campaign on factories and in the countryside, thus the ranks of the Ponies Communist Party are replenished with more and more ponies."
 equestria.35.a:0 "Troubling."
 equestria.42.t:0 "Stalliongrad Comes to Our Aid!"
 equestria.42.d:0 "It was a surprise when Stalliongrad offered to aid us in the war against the Changelings. Despite the ideological differences between our two nations, the Changelings pose a threat to both of us. Queen Chrysalis has made no secret of h ambitions to dominate all of Equus. Despite some voices within the military and government, warning about a communist plot, it was decided in a meeting of the War Council today that we should accept this offer. An official telegram was sent back informing [From.GetName] of our decision. In the meantime, we should prepare for the arrival of Stalliongradian reinforcements that are hasting towards the frontline right now. Their armoured divisions should be of a great boon for us."
 equestria.42.a:0 "Together for Victory!"
 equestria.43.t:0 "Princess Celestia Abdicates!" #dummied out
 equestria.43.d:0 "Following the start of the Equestrian Civil War, Princess Celestia refused to remain the leader of Equestria. She expressed her deepest sorrow for the fate of Equestria in the shade of latest events, saying that she had failed in preventing a disaster like this. She tearfully stated that she feels no longer able to reign the lands of Equestria, and that she would step back as leader of the Equestrian nation. No longer will her motherly glance caress equestrians in the morning No longer will she raise and lower the sun for them. Her reign, which has endured for over a thousand years, has come to an end. Princess Luna, shaken by this turn of events, will fill in her sister's spot as Equestria's leader during these dire times. Only time will tell what happens next."
 equestria.43.a:0 "Princess, no!"
 equestria.44.t:0 "The Civil War is Over!" 
 equestria.44.d:0 "After too many months, this unfortunate civil war is finally over. This terrible conflict, pitting unicorn against unicorn, pegasus against pegasus and earth pony against earth pony has torn our nation apart. Many have lost faith in the Equestrian ideal of Harmony and Friendship and seceded. However, at last, the long nightmare is all over. The forces of Harmony have prevailed and so did our ideals with them. We should, however, not forget this conflict and what led to it. We should look to the future as we begin reconstruction and recovery. We will make sure to not repeat the mistakes of the past and make ourselves stronger. We will ensure that this will never repeat. Never again a civil war!"
 equestria.44.a:0 "Equestria lives on!"
 equestria.45.t:0 "Royal Family Imprisoned"
 equestria.45.d:0 "After the successful coup in the Crystal Empire, Princess Cadence and her family were imprisoned. Princess Cadence was appointed by us to rule over the Crystal Empire and guide them towards the ideals of Harmony. During her reign, she has shown competence and righteous judgment against all. She has remained a loyal ally to us through all the storms and troubles we had faced. If the Princesses of Equestria could not even protect their own niece against enemies, no matter who they are. We have to appeal to the new authorities through the diplomatic channels and use all we have to ensure their release!"
 equestria.45.a:0 "Demand their release!"

Several therapists and friends have paid them visits, both on their journey home, or has been rumoured to be visiting in the near future. It is yet unclear if they'll return to the north to rule over the Crystal Empire. In light of this joyous moment, a national holiday has been declared declared until the end of the week.""

"Celestia, I've stayed behind the scenes since my return. I... I believe it's time for me to step up and take more responsibility."\n\nCelestia froze. Was Luna ready? Yes, of course, she thought, chiding her internal hesitation. "That sounds wonderful, Luna. We were meant to rule together. Did you have something in mind?"\n\nLuna nodded, her throat catching "The Thestrals... it isn't right, 'Tia! Equestria doesn't just have three tribes. Thestrals shouldn't be shunned, but welcomed as the fourth tribe!" Celestia raised her hoof to object but Luna continued: "I know they don't even want to be 'Equestrian', especially with all the unpleasantness after, well...you know. But... they were my little ponies, and I failed them." Her voice dropped to a whisper "I failed them, Celestia. I need to make it right. Equestria should be a friendly home to everypony."\n\nOf course it would be this, Celestia thought. The batponies had hardly been willing to join the Three Tribes after their Princess was banished to the moon, and even after Luna's return they were suspicious.\n\nBut the batponies weren't the real problem. It was the Equestrians. A small horse is easy prey at night, and something about the night loving bats seemed to instil fear and mistrust even amongst many. When Nightmare Moon rose, terrified ponies attacked batponies and drove them into the mountains. Ancient prejudices still lingered."

Luna's anxieties eased. These ponies understood this new world. They knew how to transform will into power.\n\nBut it was the activists who most transfixed Luna. They looked at her with awe, and spoke passionately of their desire for change, whether motivated by abstract principle or personal experience.\n\nThey believed in themselves, not because they knew it would work out, but because every change must begin with hope.

I've ruined everything!"\n\n"Luna, darling, you of all ponies know that the love ponies feel can't be made from commands and force! Making these reforms is just the start of the fix, you've started the discussion amongst ponykind we needed, and now we must win their hearts! You, Luna, are just the mare to do it!

I have need of you." Nightmare Moon lilted. The voice was strangely compelling, and she stared into Nightmare's slitted pupils, losing herself in the infinite abyss of the night.\n\nMisty relaxed, wondering why she was so frightened of Night... frightened of Luna? Luna sometimes visited the dreams of ponies, and her eyes were so beautiful.\n\n"I have need of you Misty. I need heroes, disciples, like yourself." Misty's heart lept. A Disciple of the Princess? A hero? She would do anything for Luna. But... had she forgotten something? She tried to remember.\n\nLuna moved closer, "Look at me, Misty and listen to my voice.

"It's dark out, isn't it?"\n\nThey relaxed, rifles lowering. "Don't surprise us like that!" A few ponies and... a batpony? Despite the night, their eyes gleamed with a strange light. Pony or batpony, these ponies served Luna just as she did. "Welcome rookie. Luna needs our help. Here's the plan..."\n\nAn hour later, three trucks rumbled down the road, approaching the gate to the base. Misty rolled down the window, as spotlights lit her face and a guard approached. "I'm here for the monthly Las Pegasus delivery."\n\n The guard frowned. "I thought that wasn't coming until morning? What's the password?" \n\n"36 Charlie November" She replied.\n\nThe guard paused "That's one of the old Royal Canterlot passwords..."\n\nIn the back, her friends readied their guns.\n\nThe guard tut-tutted at her "With the recent thefts we're shifting to local codes. Remember that next time, ok?"\n\nShe relaxed as they waved them through. They would take these weapons, distribute them to Luna's friends, and they would train.\n\nThe Disciples of Luna would be ready."

"Another friend of Luna, I see. You ok with getting your hooves dirty?"\n\nMisty nodded eagerly. The leader pointed ahead. "See this warehouse? Not military. Guards are too suspicious these days. But this? Civilian private security. For frontier and jungle towns. Loaded with all sorts of equipment for defending from wild beasties like manticores and dragons."\n\nMisty was confused "Shouldn't the Equestrian army be doing that sort of work?"\n\n"They used to, but with the Changeling threat more and more resources are being pulled elsewhere. And we can reap the benefits. Let's go."\n\nTwo hours later and safely away, the group eagerly sorted through their haul. Rifles, nets, lures, explosives, magical shields and potions. The anti-dragon rifles met murmurred approval - a weapon that could pierce dragonscale could pierce steel too.\n\nFighting creatures was not too different from fighting ponies, Misty reflected. They would take these weapons, distribute them to Luna's friends, and they would train.\n\nThe Disciples of Luna would be ready."
 equestria.205.d_3:0 "Misty crept towards a crumbled stone castle, left from the earlier days of Equestria.

And uh, don't mind our batpony friend here, he's just passing through"\n\nShe eyed the batpony. Luna's favoured, to be valued, not feared. She replied with a smile. "Its dark out, isn't it?"\n\nThe group relaxed. "Well, another one! Welcome friend, to the Disciples of Luna."\n\nEyes shone with the same determination as her own - they understood what needed to be done.\n\nWell, nearly all eyes. Up the back, a nervous pony spoke "Anyway, before I headed off, I just wanted to say - I'm overwhelmed at the recent support you've been providing to the batpony movement, but I don't understand why the secrecy and all these donations of hunting rifles? Surely the focus should be on the referendum, not getting more guns..." He glanced hopefully at Misty, as if she might speak up in his favour. She said nothing.\n\nInstead, the batpony gazed levelly in response "If you were a thestral, you'd know why you can't depend on Canterlot for safety."\n\nThe pony crumpled. "I'm sorry... I didn't mean... Anyway, thank you all. I'll get in touch again!" He hurried off.\n\nThe batpony laughed "Now that the fool is gone, we can start the real work." He looked around "Some of our friends have acquired weapons, and equipment. We will train hard. All of us must be ready.""

She understood the strange stagnation plaguing Equestria. She understood why her sister did not do this. She understood why this strange new era needed her.\n\nTears flooded her face as she spoke. "As Princess of Night, I protect and nurture the dreams of Equestria. Standing before you, I realise now how gravely I have misunderstood that role. For what use is a dream if we do not strive to make it real?"\n\n"Tonight, I make a promise. On this night, in the city that never sleeps, I will make the dreams you have entrusted to me a reality! The first of many dreams becomes real tonight! A dream of friendship! Of a great wrong righted! Of night and day made whole again!"\n\nThe moon shone bright across the city, and deep within, a burden lifted, a shrieking, hateful rage fading by the minute.

One asked "But what if it's... Nightmare Moon?".\n\nThe others nodded, hesitating.\n\nSilent himself barely held back tears. He needed to stop this kind of talk immediately. He grabbed the pony by the collar, shouting "It doesn't matter! If it's Luna, we help our Princess! If it's... Nightmare Moon, Equestria will try to imprison or expel every single Batpony! Do you think they would just forgive us?"\n\nHis voice dropped to a whisper, trembling "Do you understand? It doesn't matter." He looked at each or them in turn. "We fight, or we die."\n\nThe lights winked out, and the batponies charged into the night."

 #CELESTIA+LUNA Reform Adventures - No Civil War events here
 equestria.214.t:0 "The Shadow Market"
 equestria.214.d:0 "During their centuries largely outside outside Equestrian Society, the batponies developed their own, parallel society and even economy. Being in many areas unburdened by taxes or Equestrian laws, this economy has established itself in many places across Equestria, allowing them to make sure that any bits they earn remains within batpony society. Even the wages paid by those thestrals who worked as unregistered labourers in Equestrian industries or farms go into this shadow economy and stay there, and over time entire industries, though small scale, has grown up here. This has become a drain on the Equestrian economy as many of the three tribes have taken to spending their money there instead as well.\n\nMany thestrals take pride in their self-sufficiency, and resent the notion of having to bow to the obligations of the society they never were part of. This sentiment is echoed by several industrialists, who have tied themselves in knots trying argue for the preservation the system without saying outright that they want to be able to get away with not paying proper wages to their workers.\n\nIf the thestrals are to be integrated, this shadow market must be addressed, but the question is how."
 equestria.214.a:0 "Reintegrate them fully, but make sure to help them on the way."
 equestria.214.b:0 "We can make exceptions in some cases."
 equestria.214.c:0 "We should not be forcing this..."

 equestria.215.t:0 "Anti-Thestral Sentiments"
 equestria.215.d:0 "Whilst batponies have not traditionally been Equestrian citizens, they have had all the rights of any other visitor to our welcoming community.\n\nBut many citizens want it to remain this way. They think that batponies do not need to be integrated into society and brought out of isolation. Some are afraid of possible side effects such as a disruption of societal Harmony, others fear the rumoured Nightmare Moon cultists among the ranks of the batponies, and a few think batponies have no place among the other three races of Equestria, seeing them as complete outsiders. To them, it's as if Celestia was suggesting griffons to be welcomed as a Fourth Tribe.\n\nThe Canterlot bureaucracy has prepared an initiative to promote the integration. Groups of batponies would be invited to tour across Equestria, so the common citizens could see them with their own eyes. EEA syllabi would be rewritten to teach about batponies and their history. False rumours about cultists would be dispelled by official media. Pamphlets and posters would be distributed, showing photographs of smiling thestrals with the words "THESE BATPONIES ARE OUR FRIENDS".\n\nHowever, if taken too far, pushing this pro-batpony information can easily be considered propaganda or an attempt at forcibly changing ponies' minds about the matter."
 equestria.215.a:0 "It matters not. They must know the truth."
 equestria.215.b:0 "We could probably tone it down somewhat."
 equestria.215.c:0 "This is enough for now, then."
 
 equestria.216.t:0 "Thestral Mistrust"
 equestria.216.d:0 "Ponies may be skeptical, but the same is true for the thestrals themselves. Many of them don't trust the other Equestrians and only support the integration because Princess Luna is advocating for it. They simply want to be left alone, instead of trying to befriend other ponies.\n\nFortunately, nowhere is more equipped to handle this problem than the land of Friendship. As Princess of Friendship, Twilight Sparkle has drawn up a campaign plan that stretches down the hallway.\n\nThe plan is as inspired and diverse as it is complex and expensive - the Elements of Harmony visiting isolated thestral communities in jungles and mountains; Friendship clubs; inviting thestral students to the School of Friendship; Dusk Festivals where both batponies and other ponies would celebrate together; Celestia and Luna meeting with batpony leaders; and the list goes on..."
 equestria.216.a:0 "Are we not a nation of Friendship?"
 equestria.216.b:0 "We can tone down Twilight's enthusiasm a little."

 equestria.218.t:0 "The Reforms"
 equestria.218.d_1:0 "Luna cheerfully began her nightly rounds of the palace. She passed offices where batpony bureaucrats worked through the night, continuing the shifts from their daytime counterparts. Manehattan was often called "The city that never sleeps". Well it had become true here in Canterlot, too.\n\nAcross the nation, thestrals ventured into cities in greater numbers, attracted by employment opportunities and a new attitude of tolerance. The changes would take years, decades even, to be fully felt, but the Equestrian public was now ready to accept batponies as the Fourth Tribe, standing ready to protect their new friends from harm.\n\n"It's wonderful, isn't it?"\n\nLuna turned in surprise, to find Celestia regarding her. Luna tried to speak, but instead found herself crying. Celestia had made her dreams real. A thousand years in exile, all because she'd been too proud to ask for help!\n\nCelestia hugged Luna as the blue mare sobbed, cradling Luna in her wings. She would never let Luna down again."
 equestria.218.d_2:0 "Luna stood on a balcony, staring sadly into the night sky. She thought she saw a movement in the darkness - the flap of thestral wings perhaps? It was not uncommon to see them these days. Luna's reverie was interrupted as Celestia joined her, apparently content to stand silently.\n\nLuna spoke first "Celestia. Did we do enough? Many still have not accepted this change. We made so many compromises..."\n\nCelestia stood silent for a minute before speaking. "This is the burden we bear, Luna. You know the threats that are coming. You know the challenges we must balance. This land has stood for over a millenium, and our caution might be what ensures it will stand millennia more."\n\nLuna closed her eyes, trembling.\n\n"I know these changes are not as fast or as bold as you wish. But we have started something with these new ideas about thestrals. Maybe not this year. Maybe not this generation, even. But change will come, and one day, we will heal the scars of history."\n\nLuna nodded, holding back her disappointment. As always, her sister bore the hard-won wisdom of centuries. The foolish dreams and fancies of the night must always melt away before the illumination of the sun."
 equestria.218.a:0 "A great wrong has been righted."

These Bears, with a fur that mirrored the night sky could easily cleave a pony in half and even fought successfully against some of the most powerful unicorns Equestria had ever seen. However, the times of mythical power and wild beasts have, almost unnoticeably, come to a close in Equestria. Sword and staff have been replaced by rifle and howitzer and now a single pony can wield power that was unthinkable even a generation ago. But to fuel the fires of industry that make these marvels possible, clever ponies are always searching for new resources to exploit.\n\nThe search for new materials led a particular company to the ancient hiding places of the Ursae, in a region which was always thought off-limits to ponykind. In times past, claiming the ore-rich caverns that served as a home to the mythical bears would have been considered suicidal. Now, a few dozen hunters with high calibre rifles and explosives set out to clear the area. Carefully preparing their mines on an open field, the hunters made sure to leave nothing to chance. A spell was used to mimic the Ursa Minor's call for help, and the Majors, alarmed, rushed towards the sound. To call what ensued a battle would be too generous as the mythical beasts never even saw their attackers, before they were exterminated by the hunters' heavy weaponry.\n\nThe prospect of a new mine being opened was front-page news in the local paper the following day, with only the lamentations of an old editor on the fourth page reminding the readers that the time of magic was gone. The small column weight the comforts and safety of modern life against the adventure and mystery of the past, concluding that much was gained, but some things were also lost forever."

#MAIN SIX STORY EVENTS
equestria.173.t:0 "Farewell For Now"
equestria.173.d:0 "The small train station in Ponyville rarely had many ponies standing on the platform, but today it was more crowded than ever. Almost a hundred ponies had gathered there, half of them with heavy bags filled with food, tools and other supplies. Those would be necessary, for they were heading on a long journey, from which they may not return. The colourful Friendship Express whistled, signalling that it would soon depart. The mood was solemn and mournful; ponies were embracing each other, bidding farewell and crying.\n\nThey were going to war.\n\nTwilight Sparkle, the Princess of Friendship, was there as well, as were her friends, the Elements of Harmony: Rarity, Fluttershy, Applejack, Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie. The last three had saddlebags and were preparing to depart.\n"Well, I guess it's time to say good bye," Rainbow Dash said, breaking the silence. "The train's about to go."\nTwilight sighed deeply. "I've said it before, and I'll say it again. I respect your bravery and your choice to face Chrysalis' army. But I'm worried. This is not like the other threats we've faced. This time, a small band of heroes can't save Equestria. And I want you to remember that. Don't try to be heroes. Stay safe, and don't take unnecessary risks. We all want you to return in one piece."\nRainbow Dash rolled her eyes. "Yes Twilight, you've said that a dozen times. Don't worry, we'll be fine. We'll buck the changelings back across the border and be back home before Hearth's Warming Eve."\n"But she's right, Rainbow," Fluttershy meekly said. "You need to be careful. War is... terrifying and dangerous."\n"I'll make sure Rainbow doesn't get herself killed," Applejack said and grinned. "Dont'cha fear."\n"And I don't even plan on fighting," Pinkie said cheerily. "I will provide moral support! Cakes and parties will make even the most grim soldier happy. And maybe I can convince the changelings that war isn't as fun as partying!"\nTwilight smiled. "Alright. I trust you will be okay. We'll miss you."\nThe train whistled again.\n"Oh, wait!" Rarity exclaimed. "I still have gifts to give!" She levitated clothing and blankets from her bags and gave them to the three departing friends. "I made fabulous uniforms and cozy blankets to keep you warm."\nThey thanked her and put the gifts in their bags. "Well, we really gotta go now," Rainbow said. "Hugs?" Pinkie asked.\nThe six ponies smiled and embraced each other with their wings and forelegs. "We'll be waiting for you," Twilight whispered, and a tear flowed down her cheek."
equestria.173.a:0 "They'll be back home soon."
equestria.174.t:0 "Magical Management"
equestria.174.d:0 "Spike, Twilight Sparkle's personal dragon assistant and adoptive little brother, had spent more and more time lately in the Crystal Empire where he was celebrated as a hero who had saved the nation from Sombra's return. Now he was back in Ponyville once more, worried about the burden the Great War had placed on the Princess. He entered the Castle of Friendship, whose hallways were empty. He headed to the library and his guess was proven correct: Twilight was there, absorbed in work. She was surrounded by books and notes and was frantically writing.\n"Twilight?" He said, trying to get her attention. "I'm back from the Crystal Empire."\nShe snapped out of it and lifted her gaze from the papers. "Oh, Spike! Glad to see you. You came at a perfect time!" She levitated a scroll from her table into his claws. "Send this to Celestia. It's important."\nSpike lifted a scaly brow. "Uh, sure." He breathed shining green flame which consumed the scroll, making it magically appear in Canterlot. "What was the scroll about?"\n"A report on the research programs I've prepared for the magical experimentation departments in Bales, Stableside and Albion. They need her approval before the research can begin."\n"What are they studying?"\n"Weapons," she said casually and continued to work on her notes. "Crystal armaments, combat mage training, use of magic in industrial production. Anything that can help us win the war."\n"I see." Spike walked closer to Twilight and looked at all the paperwork. "You know, you seem to be doing a good job managing all this. You're not too stressed out."\n"Abyssinian coffee does wonders. But thanks, Spike."\n"You know, maybe you could use your organization skills and leadership for managing the frontline? With your clever head, I'm sure we'd win in a month."\nTwilight's quill stopped moving. She sighed. "I would rather not."\n"Why? Would be more effective than trying to invent some miracle weapon. It's always been thanks to your leadership that we've kicked the butts of all those villains before."\n"I-I don't want to have that responsibility now. It's not just six friends, it's millions of soldiers. A single mistake results in thousands of dead and wounded." She shut her eyes. "I don't want to bear that burden."\n"Twi, you know... one day you won't have a choice. Celestia and Luna won't be princesses forever."\n"I'm not ready yet. Just... not yet. Okay, Spike?"\nSpike sighed. "Alright, fine. Do you need any more help?"\nTwilight smiled. "Yes, actually. I'm happy you're here." She quickly embraced him with her wing before returning back to work."
equestria.174.a:0 "She'll need to be ready sooner than she thinks."
equestria.175.t:0 "A Brother's Bravery"
equestria.175.d:0 ""Ma'am, reinforcements have arrived," a pegasus mare told Applejack.\n"Fantastic! Just when we need 'em. Sergeant, keep an eye on the enemy. I'll go meet the fresh blood." The soldier saluted her and she walked down the muddy trenches, navigating to the rear of the network. Near the underground barracks were a row of trucks, pony soldiers with clean uniforms jumping out of them. A thestral officer saw Applejack and greeted her. "Greetings, ma'am. We've come to patch up your ranks."\n"Good, sir. They've been gettin' more and more sparse. The changelin' night raids are hard as Tartarus to repel." The batpony turned to his soldiers. "Atten-tion! Miss Applejack is here." They immediately went rigid, standing in a neat line. Applejack approached them and inspected them. "Youngins, I see. I hope they've gotten at least some trainin'," she mumbled. She stopped in front of a red earth pony stallion, her eyes widening. He was wearing Granny Smith's old helmet. "Big Mac? The heck are you doin' here?" she exclaimed. He remained characteristically silent for a moment. "I came here to make sure you're okay, ma'am." Applejack rolled her eyes. "So who's lookin' after the farm now?"\n"Sugar Belle. Don't worry, ma'am." She snorted. "Alrighty then. But don't expect me to treat you differently just because you're my brother."\n"Nope, ma'am."\nLater that evening, the changelings launched a probing raid against the trenches, which they thought were depleted in defenders. Applejack quickly rallied the reinforcements, Big Macintosh among them, to prevent a breakthrough. There was brutal close-quarters combat and she had to crack the exoskeletons of several changelings with her strong hind legs. Big Mac tried to help, which didn't please her much. "Guard our rear, soldier. It's too dangerous here."\n"Yup. Dangerous for you, too."\n"I'll be fine! Now go, it was an order!" As she was shouting, Big Mac looked behind her and saw a changeling lying in the mud raise her head, her pistol glinting in the crimson light of a setting sun. "What're you lookin' at? Get goin'!" Applejack barked. Big Mac pushed her aside into the trench wall, and there was a loud bang. He collapsed onto the ground.\n"Big Mac!" Applejack screamed, and saw the changeling with her smoking pistol. She let out a roar and leaped on her as she was trying to fly away with her broken wings, and began stomping her to death with her hooves. When the insectoid pony had stopped breathing, she rushed back to his brother who was already being treated by a medic. "I-Is he fine?" she asked.\n"Y-yup," Big Mac weakly responded. "Sorry for savin' your life."\nApplejack embraced him. "No, it's me who should be sayin' sorry."\n"Ma'am, his chest is bleeding. I'd appreciate if you'd leave the hugging for later," the medic said."

equestria.176.t:0 "Scars of War"
equestria.176.d:0 "Rainbow Dash had been away from combat ever since she had lost her left wing. Now she was glad to finally be back in action, commanding an air wing and training new pilots when she had time. One day, when refueling at an air base and chatting with ponies of the local garrison, she learned that Pinkie Pie was stationed nearby. She decided to go for a visit, even if it was technically unauthorized absence. So what, she thought, she was an element of harmony.\nAfter asking various soldiers, she finally found the barracks where Pinkie was stationed. She imagined it was a real party house at this point, where Pinkie cheered up the soldiers after tough fights against the changelings. She was wrong. It seemed like an ordinary barracks, with all the bunk beds arrayed in neat order. For a moment she thought she was at the wrong place, but then she saw a pink pony lying on a bed. She barely recognized her.\n"Pinkie?" she cautiously asked. The mare with a straight mane slowly turned to look at her, then her eyes widened slightly. "Oh, Rainbow Dash. Why are you here?" Rainbow was struck by how dour she sounded. The colours of her coat seemed muted as well. "Uh, I thought I'd come by for a visit, to see how you're doing. We haven't talked in a long time."\n"Oh yes. You lost your wing, didn't you?" Rainbow extended her prosthetic metal wing. "Yep. But this new one is pretty rad, so I don't mind. Hurt like Tartarus at first but I'm getting used to it."\n"That's good."\n"Pinkie, is everything alright? Why aren't you... acting like yourself?" Pinkie breathed in deeply and closed her eyes. "I'm fine."\n"I might've lost my wing, but I still have my eyes and I can see something is wrong. What happened?" Pinkie grimaced. "I guess I should tell you, even though I don't want to. A couple months ago I was holding a party for Maud's Rock Troopers. However, there were changeling infiltrators in the group, and they revealed themselves and started shooting." A concerned frown formed on Rainbow's face. "Oh no. And then what?"\nShe shrugged. "I did what I had to, out of fear and desperation. In the end, the changelings were dead, and the party was thoroughly pooped."\nIt was a typical Pinkie joke, but the delivery was so dry that even Rainbow wasn't amused. "That... sucks. I wish I could've been there to protect you."\n"I don't need that anymore. I fight with Maud on the front. I haven't been in the mood for happy things after the incident."\nRainbow was speechless. "Pinkie, I—"\n"I'm fine, like I said. Don't you worry. War isn't the place for laughter. But after it's over, everything will be fine again."\n"Promise? I wanna to see you smile and hear you laugh. We can do our old pranks, maybe that will make you feel better." A faint smile appeared on Pinkie's lips. "Sure, Dashie.""

equestria.177.d:0 "Clothing design was Rarity's passion, that could not be debated. But after months of designing dull military uniforms with drab colours and directing their production en masse, she was growing tired of it. Occasionally, when she had precious free time, she'd try to design a beautiful dress for her own enjoyment, but oftentimes even that wasn't as satisfying as it had been before the war. So now, when she had a day off, she needed another distraction from the stress of war-time production. She decided to visit her friend Fluttershy, who had recently come to Canterlot, and headed to her apartment near the underground magi-nuclear research facility, her mind full of questions.\n\nAs soon as the door of her home was opened, the stench of animals filled Rarity's nostrils. Fluttershy greeted her warmly, not minding the odour as usual. "Oh, hi Rarity, good to see you! I hope you don't mind that I brought some friends along from Ponyville." A bear was sitting on the living room sofa.\n"Uhm, no, not at all darling! Now, prepare some hot water. I'd like to drink tea and have a pleasant chat. We haven't seen in so long, goodness gracious!"\nA toucan and a ferret prepared two cups of steaming tea. Fluttershy thanked the animals and they replied with cheery sounds.\n"So, Fluttershy, first of all: What in Celestia's name are you doing in a magi-nuclear research facility?"\n"Oh, erm, I know it seems strange, but as the Element of Kindness, I was asked to give ethical oversight to the development of magi-nuclear weapons. I accepted, because I think it's important they're developed, and are then used right."\nRarity raised an eyebrow. "You think it's important that they're developed? Aren't they... extremely potent, from what I've heard?"\n"Oh, yes. That is the point. You see, their intent is to act as a deterrent and a threat. Once we have a working magi-nuclear bomb, Queen Chrysalis will be so scared that she will sue for peace for sure! And then no one else will ever threaten Equestria again."\n"I cannot help but regard that as quite optimistic. Chrysalis seems very determined in her cause. Also, what if someone else develops such a weapon?"\nFluttershy smiled. "The day when two countries can annihilate each other in one second, all of the world, it is to be hoped, will recoil from war and discharge their troops. We will have world peace forever."\nRarity couldn't help but feel uneasy, and that this was going to end poorly. But she did not want to ruin the mood or insult Fluttershy. This seemed important to her. It was best to change the topic. "Well, I hope everything works out. So, who looks after your animal sanctuary?""

equestria.180.d:0 "It was over.\n\nPinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash and Applejack all managed to get in the same train headed to Ponyville. The old Friendship Express had been destroyed by a changeling bombing raid, so they returned home on a repurposed cargo train. It wasn't a comfortable ride, but they were still happy because they were finally together again.\nRainbow broke the silence between them. "So, we won. How many changelings did you kill? I got 241, mostly from air combat."\n"The heck? You kept count? Is everything a competition for you?" Applejack asked, appalled. "Anyhow, 242, mostly from close quarters combat, as my scars show."\nRainbow Dash chuckled. "Welp, better luck next time for me, I guess." She turned to Pinkie Pie, who still hadn't said anything. "Yo Pinkie, you alright? Remember what you promised to me. I miss your laugther."\nShe sighed. "Not now, Dashie. But maybe later."\n\nThe train whistled and arrived at Ponyville's station, or what remained of it after wartime bombing. The three mares left the carriage and were embraced by Twilight, Rarity and Fluttershy, who were there to meet them. "I'm so happy to see you!" Twilight said and struggled to hold back tears. "You all made it back home in one piece."\n"Rainbow didn't," Applejack said, grinned and poked her prosthetic metal wing.\n"Oh, you three look so weary and battered, and your clothes are beginning to fall apart!" Rarity exclaimed.\n"Well, you don't win wars by looking fancy," Rainbow said with a grin.\n"What's wrong, Pinkie?" Fluttershy asked with concern in her voice. All five turned to look at her. Pinkie averted eye contact.\n"Nothing. I'm glad to be back home. Even though it may not seem like it."\n"You know, Pinkie," Twilight said, "Ponyville is preparing to hold a party to celebrate the end of the war. But I think they need someone to organize it."\n"Aha."\n"Wouldn't you like to do that, darling?" Rarity asked. "Maybe that would make you feel better."\nPinkie sighed. "Alright, fine. But I think I will need you guys to help. I've gotten a bit rusty. And... well, I'm not the same as I was."\nRainbow wrapped her metal wing around her. "Pinkie, we'll be with you, always. And we will do anything to make you happy again. Of course we'll help you with the party. No need to even ask such silly things."\nHesitantly, Pinkie hugged her back, then embraced her tight and began to cry. The rest joined the hug as well, reassuring Pinkie and reminding her that she was not alone, and that everything was going to be fine."

equestria.181.d:0 "Recently, as pony soldiers on the front prepared to celebrate Hearth's Warming Eve, something strange happened. There have been reports that at one fortified position near the changeling frontline, some ponies climbed over the trench waving a white flag. Changelings honourably did not open fire and allowed the enemy soldiers to get near. The ponies then invited the changelings soldiers to celebrate Hearth's Warming with them in No Creature's Land. Surprisingly, some of the changelings, even a few officers, accepted the offer.\n\nAs the moon rose, the ponies and changelings drank cider and hot chocolate milk, sang carols and even played some hoofball. Soldiers casually chatted with each other, talking of their families and civilian lives, and telling traditional stories. Changelings of course do not celebrate pony holidays, but were very curious and seemed to enjoy it.\n\nAfter reports of the incident spread, the high command on both sides reacted. The Equestrian army used this as a chance to show the value of friendship and that changelings were fighting against their will, using the opportunity to portray Chrysalis and her posse as warmongering tyrants. On the other side, the Queen was outraged by this and forbid any knowledge of it to spread, putting the nation's censorship bureaus to work. She then ordered capital punishment on every single soldier and officer who had taken part in the "treachery". However, some of the changelings managed to desert and escape, being welcomed warmly by Equestrian soldiers. They are now prisoners of war but are treated well."

She was encouraged to hold the event by Princess Luna so various disputes could be resolved before they reached a boiling point. Princess Twilight Sparkle was once again responsible for organizing the event. The last summit held in 1005 had almost been an embarrasing fiasco, so extra precautions were made to ensure everything would go smoothly. This time there would be no giant gemstone statue due to the last summit's incident.\n\nThe summit ended up being almost as large as the last one, with delegates from over fifty cities and towns arriving in the capital. There were three days of conferences, receptions and meetings, with Princesses attending them actively. Representatives spoke openly of issues in their home towns: Mayor Ash Moustache's delegate from Baltimare spoke of issues with integrating the local thestral minority and the rising influence of anarcho-syndicalist CAN-TER, Mayor Goldwin's delegate from Vanhoover said something had to be done about Stalliongradian infiltration of the navy stationed in the city, Mayor Rokenhar's delegate from Las Pegasus spoke of the corruption and greed of local companies while representatives of other south-western cities complained of neglect from the central government. Most ominously, the delegate from Acornage warned of ever-growing Changeling military activity on the border. The Princesses took note of all the issues and promised that they would be taken care of.\n\nThe rest of the summit was spent making trade deals, celebrating the local cultures of Equestria's numerous cities, holding speeches on matters of economy and politics and discussing the events of the world at large. At the end of the event, Princess Celestia held a speech thanking everypony for coming all the way to Canterlot and said that as long as the cities of Equestria worked together in harmony, the country as a whole would have a bright and prosperous future."

While she is earnest in reintegrating towards modern society, and earning the adoration of her subjects, Luna rarely enjoys the attention her elder sister, Princess Celestia, receives. Her efforts in guarding the dreams of ponies are greatly appreciated, but what is Luna's greatest contribution today is leading ponies in the field, much like in the glory days of old before Equestria's unification.

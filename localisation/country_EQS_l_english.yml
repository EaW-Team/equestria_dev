EQS_sombra_return_civil_war_help_desc:0 "In a perfect storm of evil and bad timing, Sombra has returned to the Crystal Empire. He and his followers are already engaging Loyalists in the streets, and gunfire echoes across the snow. We are in poor shape to fully commit to aiding Cadance's Loyalists, but we have several eager volunteers ready to cross the border. Perhaps it's time to allow this?"

EQS_sombra_return_war_desc:0 "The time has come to strike back against this century's old barbarism. Our volunteer forces are chomping at the bit, and with the situation over there getting no better according to our spies, it is time to fight for the defence of Equestria."

eqs_prevent_the_vote_desc:0 "The children demanding a referendum are obviously misguided and unaware of consequences. It is in their best interest for status quo to continue. The Princess knows best, after all, for she has guided us for so long. To doubt her would be treason."
eqs_jail_dissenters:0 "Jail Dissenters"

eqs_come_to_compromise_desc:0 "Now that the war has ended, ponies have looked inward at the shambles of their nation, their livelihoods, and most of all, their government that for so long guided them on a path to Harmony, but then suddenly lead them to catastrophic war. Now more than ever, they demand power over their own destinies, but order needs to be maintained. What do we do?"
eqs_allow_the_vote:0 "Allow the Vote of No Confidence"
eqs_allow_the_vote_desc:0 "We've seen the writing on the wall and we can't deny it any longer. The rule of the Alicorn Sisters has shattered and the ponies are disillusioned. The ponies demand what they call a "Vote of No Confidence", so they shall have one."

eqs_powers_of_the_diet_desc:0 "There was not a majority vote against the monarchy, but this large minority could not be ignored lest we want to risk more pointless conflict.

eqs_new_royal_role:0 "The New Royal Role"
eqs_new_royal_role_desc:0 "The vote came somewhat close but still resulted in a strong majority against the monarchy. Agreements have been made to let it remain, but it will be balanced with an elected parliament."

eqs_new_equestrian_republic_desc:0 "The vote ended with a resounding and uncompromising cry for self-government, so the ancien régime has been dragged down, the new Republic standing in its place. We must quickly secure law, order, and justice on our own terms, it is only the beginning."
eqs_maintain_autonomies:0 "Maintain Traditional Autonomies"

eqs_figurehead_monarch:0 "A Figurehead Monarchy"
eqs_figurehead_monarch_desc:0 "It is uncertain, but by either Parliamentary vote or by voluntary action, the Monarchy has decided to take a laid back political role. They will have no active official powers and act in an advisory role and as the face of the government and embodiment of Equestria."

eqs_species_rights_desc:0 "Already we've encountered a great hurdle in the founding of our new Republic... in the wording of our still infant founding documents and in the face of war around the world, we're faced with more and more non-pony refugees.

eqs_harmony_not_what_it_used_to_be_desc:0 "The year of trials and tribulations, at least politically, is finally over. Equestria and the Harmony we hold within it is finally secure again, even if it is not the same we began with. We must now look outward."

EQS_strengthen_EEA_authority_desc:0 "For a thousand years, the EEA has ensured that everypony in Equestria receives only the most high quality education.

 equestria.1.t:0 "Happy Hearthswarming Eve and Happy New Year!"
 equestria.1.d:0 "Several days ago all ponies celebrated Hearthswarming Eve and now the New year has come. Everypony on the streets are sharing an optimistic view on the future and wishing all strangers a happy new year, because, nobody is actually a stranger in Equestria. The Princesses have given their traditional speech to the public as well, making the spirit of Harmony and Unity known throughout all of Equestria."
 equestria.1.a:0 "Good fun."
 equestria.2.t:0 "Buffalo Problem"
 equestria.2.d:0 "We are ready to send the official appeal of ponies and buffalo friendship to the Buffalo State. This will improve our relations with them and we will probably be hope for later cooperation and understanding. However some of our military minds are suggesting another variant of situation. Unleash the Equestrian war machine and quickly destroy the independent buffalo state in a lightning war. They suggest that this will improve our military situation overall and will provide experience for our troops, which may be useful in near future. What shall we do?"
 equestria.2.a:0 "Send the envoy. Such militaristic rhetoric does not have a place in our nation."
 equestria.2.b:0 "Start the engines, let's get this over with."
 equestria.3.t:0 "Situational Awareness"
 equestria.3.d:0 "An extensive report produced by an internal committee details a number of state issues varying from the threat of the Changelings, to Stalliongradian border disputes, to growing Griffonian tensions, to dissatisfaction of marginalised political activists within the country. In addition, the committee was responsible for valuating current government planned responses in light of these situations, and most were deemed inadequate or wholly lacking.\n\nThis came as a shock to many ponies, who view life in Equestria as being mostly tranquil and safe from the sensation of a looming threat on the horizon. As such, many opposition papers had a field day denouncing the Equestrian government and inflating its incapacity to lead the nation. While most of these are marginal and have little circulation, the facts are clear: Equestria needs to ready itself for what may yet come."
 equestria.3.a:0 "This is a wake up call."
 equestria.4.t:0 "The Academy for Gifted Unicorns"
 equestria.4.d:0 "Funds have reached the study place of well-known Twilight Sparkle, the School for Gifted Unicorns in Canterlot. Modern facilities has been bought for study and research purposes."

 equestria.5.a:0 "Excellent."
 equestria.6.t:0 "Public Schools Funding"
 equestria.6.d:0 "We're slowly improving our system of public schools. Equestria needs better education. The Princesses have been touring the country as well, giving passionate speeches about the joy of learning."
 equestria.6.a:0 "Wisdom is power, my little ponies."
 equestria.7.t:0 "War Committee"
 equestria.7.d:0 "We have assembled a War Committee. Now we shall be able to get more ponies into higher military ranks and scientists to supervise our research."

Thus we're going to protect her from possible assassination attempts and hope to bring harmony to the throne of Olenia in the future."
 equestria.11.a:0 "Care for tea, Velvet?"
 equestria.12.t:0 "Accession of the Buffalo State"
 equestria.12.d:0 "Today we've gladly accepted the Buffalo State as an autonomous region of Equestria. Older chiefs of this enclave country couldn't think of such a possibility, however, the situation has changed in recent years due to Chieftess Strongheart. We celebrate unity of ponies and buffaloes today."
 equestria.12.a:0 "That's a new one."
 equestria.13.t:0 "Slowly Recovering"
 equestria.13.d:0 "Our newly appointed administration is doing its job in converting the economy of this country to war-ready state. There is already good progress, but there's still much to be done to be fully in good shape."
 equestria.13.a:0 "Now that's good news."
 equestria.14.t:0 "Magical Nukes"
 equestria.14.d:0 "Our scientists are working on ultimate weapon of war. And one of recent projects sparked their interest. It is a concept of necromantic megaspell bomb, that, in theory will have explosion capability that of many tonnes of dynamite. It is difficult to comprehend such an extraordinary power, but we need a weapon to turn the tide of this war."
 equestria.14.a:0 "Sounds good to me."
 equestria.15.t:0 "Stalliongrad Declines Research Agreement"
 equestria.15.d:0 "Stalliongradian authorities have rejected our offer of joint research. Talk about international friendship."
 equestria.15.a:0 "Oh well..."
 equestria.16.t:0 "Almost Recovered"

"Celestia, I've stayed behind the scenes since my return. I... I believe it’s time for me to step up and take more responsibility."\n\nCelestia froze. Was Luna ready? Yes, of course, she thought, chiding her internal hesitation. "That sounds wonderful, Luna. We were meant to rule together. Did you have something in mind?"\n\nLuna nodded, her throat catching "The Thestrals... it isn't right, ‘Tia! Living in the mountains, slaving in sweatshops, unwelcome in the cities" Celestia raised her hoof to object but Luna continued "I know they don't even want to be 'Equestrian', especially with all the unpleasantness after, well...you know. But... they were my little ponies, and I failed them." Her voice dropped to a whisper "I failed them, Celestia. I need to make it right"\n\nOf course it would be this, Celestia thought. The batponies had hardly been willing to rejoin Equestria after their Princess was banished to the moon, and even after Luna's return they were suspicious.\n\nBut the batponies weren't the real problem. It was Equestrian ponies. A small horse is easy prey at night, and something about bats seemed to instil fear and mistrust even amongst the best of them. When Nightmare Moon rose, terrified ponies lynched batponies and drove them into the mountains. Over the centuries, the predjudices of the past grew, and batponies were mistrusted everywhere they went."

Luna's anxieties eased. These ponies understood this new world. They knew how to transform will into power. \n\nBut it was the activists who most transfixed Luna. They looked at her with awe, and spoke passionately of their desire for change, whether motivated by abstract principle or personal experience. \n\nThey believed in themselves, not because they knew it would work out, but because every change must begin with hope. Luna felt suddenly ashamed of her despair after her speech. These ponies had no great magic powers, no divine right to rule, yet believed in themselves with nothing but a kind heart and a goal.

We'll win this referendum, and I know ponies plenty to help us in Canterlot. We shall reawaken the kindness in ponykind!"\n\nLuna took a shuddering breath and nodded.

She sat outside the city at night, watching the stars.\n\nThe stars suddenly flickered as something flew towards her! She shrieked, backing away as a large, inky black alicorn faced her.\n\nAbsolute terror filled her as Nightmare Moon stood in front of her - the ancient monster of Luna's corruption!\n\n"Misty Night. I have need of you." Nightmare Moon lilted. The voice was strangely compelling, and she stared into Nightmare's slitted pupils, losing herself in the infinite abyss of the night.\n\nMisty relaxed, wondering why was she so frightened of Luna? Luna sometimes visited the dreams of ponies, and her eyes were so beautiful.\n\n"I have need of you Misty. I need heroes, disciples, like yourself." Misty's heart lept. A Disciple of the Princess? A hero? She would do anything for Luna. But...had she forgotten something? She tried to remember.\n\nLuna moved closer, "Look at me, Misty and listen to my voice.

"It’s dark out, isn't it?"\n\nThey relaxed, rifles lowering. "Don't surprise us like that!" A few ponies and... a batpony? Despite the night, their eyes gleamed with determination. Pony or batpony, these ponies served Luna just as she did. "Welcome rookie. Luna needs our help. Here's the plan..."\n\nAn hour later, three trucks rumbled down the road, approaching the gate to the base. Misty rolled down the window, as spotlights lit her face and a guard approached. "I'm here for the monthly Las Pegasus delivery."\n\n The guard frowned. "I thought that wasn't coming until morning? What's the password?" \n\n"36 Charlie November" She replied.\n\nThe guard paused "That's one of the old Royal Canterlot passwords..."\n\nIn the back, her friends readied their guns.\n\nThe guard tut-tutted at her "With the recent thefts we're shifting to local codes. Remember that next time, ok?"\n\nShe relaxed as they waved them through. They would take these weapons, distribute them to Luna's friends, and they would train.\n\nThe Disciples of Luna would be ready."

And uh, don't mind our batpony friend here, he's just passing through"\n\nShe eyed the batpony. Luna's favoured, to be valued, not feared. She replied with a smile. "Its dark out, isn't it?"\n\nThe group relaxed. "Well, another one! Welcome friend, to the Disciples of Luna."\n\nEyes shone with the same determination as her own - they understood what needed to be done. \n\nWell, nearly all eyes. Up the back, a nervous pony spoke "Anyway, before I headed off, I just wanted to say - I'm overwhelmed at the recent support you've been providing to the batpony rights movement, but I don't understand why the secrecy and all these survivalist drills? What use this is for a referendum?" He glanced hopefully at Misty, as if she might speak up in his favour. She said nothing.\n\nInstead, the batpony gazed levelly in response "If you were a thestral, you'd know why you can't depend on Canterlot for safety"\n\nThe pony crumpled. "I'm sorry... I didn't mean...Anyway, thank you all. I'll get in touch again!" He hurried off.\n\nThe batpony laughed "Now that he's gone, we can start the real work." He looked around "Some of our friends have acquired weapons, and equipment. We will train hard. All of us must be ready.""

Why do the other ponies hate us? Why is Luna helping us?"\n\nDusk Horizons sighed. "Over 1000 years ago, Luna was our Princess. She lived at night as we do and made the night wonderful. She loved us, and we loved her. But we didn't tell her. We complained about the other ponies instead, about how mean they were. They didn't like our night, or our bat wings. And Luna grew lonely and sad. Because we failed her, she transformed into Nightmare Moon for a long time, becoming angry and evil.

 ## CELESTIA + LUNA Reform Adventures - No Civil Wars here
 equestria.214.t:0 "The Business Community"
 equestria.214.d:0 "Celestia and Luna may be monarchs, but no monarch rules alone. Twisting hooves, sweet talking, compromises, and judicious wielding of absolute authority are all necessary to ensure that policies are in place on the ground, not just in the books.\n\nCelestia's first target is the business community. Equestria's rapid industrialisation has brought a need for cheap labour, and many manufacturers have been 'kind' enough to offer batponies jobs, with conditions and pay far below the 'normal pony'. It certainly doesn't help that most of the authorities are asleep during typical batpony working hours.\n\nIdeally, throwing the worst offenders in jail, compromising with unions to welcome batponies, offering incentives for on the book batponies, and ensuring the authorities are doing nighttime checks should fix the worst of the behaviour. But is it worth the cost?"
 equestria.214.a:0 "Full implementation."
 equestria.214.b:0 "Compromise is the Equestrian way."
 equestria.214.c:0 "Some token reforms here and there."

 equestria.215.t:0 "Anti-Batpony Radicalism"
 equestria.215.d:0 "Whilst batponies have not traditionally been Equestrian citizens, they have had all the rights of any other visitor to our welcoming community.\n\nThey fear not our laws, but our radicals. The ponies who drop anonymous threats in mailboxes, bring vigilante 'justice' to batpony 'criminals', and spread hate and fear to all who will listen.\n\nThe Canterlot bureaucracy has prepared a deradicalization initiative - naming and shaming known sympathisers, police infiltration of radical groups, and new powers to combat hate speech.\n\nUnfortunately, such radicals are mostly found amongst our more militarist population, who have been pushing for increasing military preparedness - a crackdown will likely erode our already limited resolve for war and defensive preparations."
 equestria.215.a:0 "It matters not. Extremism shall not be tolerated."
 equestria.215.b:0 "We could probably overlook extremism in the military."
 equestria.215.c:0 "We cannot defend batponies if we cannot defend Equestria."
 
 equestria.216.t:0 "Popular Mistrust"
 equestria.216.d:0 "Radicals and business corruption are important issues, but it is our lack of Friendship that truly shames us. Ponies simply don't like or trust thestrals, and it colours every interaction between our societies.\n\nFortunately, nowhere is more equipped to handle this problem than the land of Friendship. As Princess of Friendship, Twilight Sparkle has drawn up a campaign plan that stretches down the hallway.\n\nThe plan is as inspired and diverse as it is complex and expensive - speaking tours by the Elements of Harmony; rewriting EEA Syllabi to teach the story of the thestrals; Love a Bat Day; Government awareness campaigns; Funding for Bats Rights Activists; Friendship clubs. The list goes on..."
 equestria.216.a:0 "Are we not a nation of Friendship?"
 equestria.216.b:0 "We can tone down Twilight's enthusiasm a little."

 equestria.217.a:0 "It’s up to the ponies of Equestria now."
 
 equestria.218.t:0 "The Reforms"
 equestria.218.d_1:0 "Luna cheerfully began her nightly rounds of the palace. She passed offices where batpony bureaucrats worked through the night, continuing the shifts from their daytime counterparts. Manehattan was often called "The city that never sleeps". Well it had become true here in Canterlot, too.\n\nAcross the nation, thestrals ventured into cities in greater numbers, attracted by employment opportunities and a new attitude of tolerance. The changes would take years, decades even, to be fully felt, but public discrimination was now the exception, not the rule, and ponies stood ready to protect their new friends from it.\n\n"It’s wonderful, isn't it?"\n\nLuna turned in surprise, to find Celestia regarding her. Luna tried to speak, but instead found herself crying. Celestia had made her dreams real. 1000 years in exile, all because she'd been too proud to ask for help!\n\nCelestia hugged Luna as the blue mare sobbed, cradling Luna in her wings. She would never let Luna down again."
 equestria.218.d_2:0 "Luna stood on a balcony, staring sadly into the night sky. She thought she saw a movement in the darkness - the flap of thestral wings perhaps? It was not uncommon to see them these days. Luna's reverie was interrupted as Celestia joined her, apparently content to stand silently.\n\nLuna spoke first "Celestia. Did we do enough? Things remain difficult for the batponies. We made so many compromises..."\n\nCelestia stood silent for a minute before speaking. "This is the burden we bear, Luna. You know the threats that are coming. You know the challenges we must balance. This land has stood for a millennium, and our caution might be what ensures it will stand millennia more."\n\nLuna closed her eyes, trembling.\n\n"I know these changes are not as fast or as bold as you wish. But we have started something with these new ideas about thestrals. Maybe not this year. Maybe not this generation, even. But change will come, and one day, we will heal the scars of history."\n\nLuna nodded, holding back her disappointment. As always, her sister bore the hard-won wisdom of centuries. The foolish dreams and fancies of the night must always melt away before the illumination of the sun."
 equestria.218.a:0 "A great wrong has been righted."
 equestria.218.b:0 "One day, Equestria will be whole."

equestria.170.d:0 "There was a time when everypony lived in awe of the great bears Ursa Minor and Ursa Major. These Bears, with a fur that mirrored the night sky could easily cleave a pony in half and even fought successfully against some of the most powerful unicorns Equestria had ever seen. However, the times of mythical power and wild beasts have, almost unnoticeably, come to a close in Equestria. Sword and staff have been replaced by rifle and howitzer and now a single pony can wield power that was unthinkable even a generation ago. But to fuel the fires of industry that make these marvels possible, clever ponies are always searching for new resources to exploit.\n\nThe search for new materials led a particular company to the ancient hiding places of the Ursae, in a region which was always thought off-limits to ponykind. In times past, claiming the ore-rich caverns that served as a home to the mythical bears would have been considered suicidal. Now, a few dozen hunters with high calibre rifles and explosives set out to clear the area. Carefully preparing their mines on an open field, the hunters made sure to leave nothing to chance. A spell was used to mimic the Ursa Minor’s call for help, and the Majors, alarmed, rushed towards the sound. To call what ensued a battle would be too generous as the mythical beasts never even saw their attackers, before they were exterminated by the hunters’ heavy weaponry.\n\nThe prospect of a new mine being opened was front-page news in the local paper the following day, with only the lamentations of an old editor on the fourth page reminding the readers that the time of magic was gone. The small column weight the comforts and safety of modern life against the adventure and mystery of the past, concluding that much was gained, but some things were also lost forever."

EQS_bring_back_civil_war_countries:0 "The "Welcome Home" program" 
EQS_bring_back_civil_war_countries_desc:0 "The war is over, and our way of life has been saved. But there is still work to be done. We must approach the remaining break-away states and re-forge the bonds of Harmony and fellowship that the war destroyed. Equestria will be whole once more." 

EQS_bring_back_SCS:0 "Approach the South" 
EQS_bring_back_SCS_desc:0 "The ponies of the south-west are rugged, stubborn, and independent by nature. But they are still ponies, and fundamentally Equestrian ideals rest in their hearts. With the right approach, there is a good chance that their "Confederation" may be passed into history without bloodshed."

EQS_bring_back_VAN:0 "Approach Vanhoover" 
EQS_bring_back_VAN_desc:0 "An independent Vanhoover is in a hopeless strategic position, and their leaders, if they are sane, must know this. Our reintegration of them will surely require little more than sending a demand."

EQS_bring_back_BAL:0 "Approach Baltimare" 
EQS_bring_back_BAL_desc:0 "Of all the break-aways, the reintegration of Baltimare may prove to be the most... nuanced. The possibility of Stalliongradian interference cannot be discounted. We must trot carefully, if we are to bring this shining city back into our family without bloodshed."

EQS_bring_back_JUN:0 "Approach Caballeron" 
EQS_bring_back_JUN_desc:0 "The mere existence of Caballeron's "nation" is an absurdity. He is nothing more than a criminal entrepreneur, bereft of any legitimacy. But, regardless, we must make the effort to talk to him if we are to reclaim the deep Jungles without bloodshed. Hopefully his ego will not inhibit his reason."

LUNA_DESC:0 "The younger of the Royal Sisters, Princess Luna is somewhat of a mystery to the ponies of Equestria. Her appearances in public are quite brief and her celebrations receive smaller attention. Nominally equal in power to her sibling, she struggles with adapting to modern statehood and yearns for the days of old, where the Princesses wielded a more direct approach. Nonetheless, Luna does her best in ruling Equestria and provides a great deal of military knowledge and strategies from her glory days of old. Still, she is often haunted by her past mistakes, and might find it difficult to keep going, were it not for Celestia's love and kindness..."
swift_milf_desc:0 "Born in Severyana, 967, Swift Wing was raised among her three older brothers. They were often two trots away from poverty, and thus it was no surprise that when their father enlisted for the Equestrian Guard, he took his children with him to Canterlot. Swift Wing received advanced education in one of Canterlot's private school. Once she became eligible for enlistment, she joined a different unit than her father's. Swift Wing's constitution ensured she passed the most rigorous exercises, towering over most of the stallions. When Severyana rose up in rebellion, she did not side with her homeland, stressing that loyalty to Equestria comes first and foremost. Afterward during the first Changeling invasion in 1002, Swift Wing was blinded in her right eye when a stray grenade detonated too close. She continued to serve in the Royal Engineer Corps regardless in a supporting role. Her tenacity in the face of injuries and setbacks inspires the soldiers under her command."
ancap_trench_boi_desc:0 "From an early age, Thunderbolt Sentinel knew that protecting others is his drive and talent. He went on to join the Equestrian Royal Guard, despite the protests of his father, who didn't want his son anywhere near the army. Sentinel's time in the boot camp only reinforced his belief that he belonged there. He was present during the first Changeling attack on Canterlot, which clearly showed that the Royal Guard was unprepared for the greater threat. Afterward, he applied for officer courses, in which he excelled. His fondness of defensive strategies and digging trenches was favoured by the Equestrian command staff, and he eventually rose up to a part of the military high command. Sentinel would love nothing more than to personally oversee the construction of a defensive line on the Changeling border, which his colleagues jokingly call "the Sentinel Line"."

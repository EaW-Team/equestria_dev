### EVENTS #####
######### EQS # EQUESTRIA ##################
 equestria.1.t:0 "Happy Hearthswarming Eve and Happy New Year!"
 equestria.1.d:0 "Several days ago all ponies celebrated Hearthswarming Eve and now the new year has come. Everypony on the streets are sharing an optimistic view on the future and wishing all strangers a happy new year, because, actually, nobody is a stranger in Equestria."
 equestria.1.a:0 "Good fun."
 equestria.2.t:0 "Buffalo Problem"
 equestria.2.d:0 "We are ready to send the official appeal of ponies and buffalo friendship to the Buffalo State. This will improve our relations with them and we will probably be hope for later cooperation and understanding. However some of our military minds are suggesting another variant of situation. Unleash the equestrian war machine and quickly destroy the independent buffalo state in a lightning war. They suggest that this will improve our military situation overall and will provide experience for our troops, which may be useful in near future. What shall we do?"
 equestria.2.a:0 "Send the envoy. Such militaristic rhetoric does not have a place in our nation."
 equestria.2.b:0 "Start the engines, let's get this over with."
 equestria.3.t:0 "Situational Awareness"
 equestria.3.d:0 "An extensive report produced by an internal committee details a number of state issues varying from the threat of the Changelings, to Stalliongradian border disputes, to growing Griffonian tensions, to dissatisfaction of marginalized political activists within the country. In addition, the committee was responsible for valuating current government planned responses in light of these situations, and most were deemed inadequate or wholly lacking.\n\nThis came as a shock to many Ponies, who view life in Equestria as being mostly tranquil and safe from the sensation of a looming threat on the horizon. As such, many opposition papers had a field day denouncing the Equestrian government and inflating its incapacity to lead the nation. While most of these are marginal and have little circulation, the facts are clear: Equestria needs to ready itself for what may yet come."
 equestria.3.a:0 "This is a wake up call."
 equestria.4.t:0 "The Academy for Gifted Unicrons"
 equestria.4.d:0 "Funds have reached the study place of well-known Twilight Sparkle, the School for Gifted Unicorns in Canterlot. Modern facilities has been bought for study and research purposes."

Thus we're going to protect her from possible assassination attempts and hope to bring harmony to the throne of Olenia in the future."
 equestria.11.a:0 "Surely."
 equestria.12.t:0 "Accession of the Buffalo State"
 equestria.12.d:0 "Today we've gladly accepted the Buffalo State as an autonomous region of Equestria. Older chiefs of this enclave country couldn't think of such a possibility, however, the situation has changed in recent years due to Chieftess Strongheart. We celebrate unity of ponies and buffalos today."
 equestria.12.a:0 "That's a new one."
 equestria.13.t:0 "Slowly recovering."
 equestria.13.d:0 "Our newly appointed administration is doing its job in coverting the economy of this country to war-ready state. There is already good progress, but there's still much to be done to be fully in good shape."
 equestria.13.a:0 "Now that's good news."
 equestria.14.t:0 "Magical Nukes"
 equestria.14.d:0 "Our scientists are working on ultimate weapon of war. And one of recent projects sparked their interest. It is a concept of necromantic megaspell bomb, that, in theory will have explosion capability that of many tonnes of TNT."

 equestria.19.d:0 "Dragons council accepted our offer and cedes Badlands."
 equestria.19.a:0 "Right."
 equestria.20.t:0 "Draongs accept on second thought"
 equestria.20.d:0 "After visit of Spike to the Dragon's Lair, he managed to persuade to peacefully transfer Badlands to Equestria."
 equestria.20.a:0 "Way to go."

 equestria.34.d:0 "Many big cities saw communists, socialists, workers and sympathizers going on the solidarity march through the major streets. The event is dedicated to the Labour Day celebrated on 1st of May. These ponies say that they share their solidarity with all the opressed working class creatures of the world."
 equestria.34.a:0 "Let them be."
 equestria.34.b:0 "Crush the demonstration!"
 equestria.35.t:0 "Communist Acitvity."
 equestria.35.d:0 "After the socialist ponies were chased down by the Royal Guards during the Labour Day demonstration, political views of the left-wing ponies turned drastically radical.

 equestria.35.a:0 "Okay."
 equestria.43.t:0 "Princess Celestia abdicates!"
 equestria.43.d:0 "Following the start of the Equestrian Civil War, Princess Celestia refused to remain the leader of Equestria. She expressed her deepest sorrow for the fate of Equestria in the shade of latest events, saying that she had failed in preventing a disaster like this. She tearfully stated that she feels no longer able to reign the lands of Equestria, and that she would step back as leader of the equestrian nation. No longer will her motherly glance caress equestrians in the morning No longer will she raise and lower the sun for them. Her reign, which has endured for over a thousand years, has come to an end. Princess Luna, shaken by this turn of events, will fill in her sister’s spot as Equestria’s leader during these dire times. Only time will tell what happens next."
 equestria.43.a:0 "Oh no."

newseqsdem.2.a:0 "Equestrians are slow to change."
newseqsdem.2.b:0 "There will be much to debate..."
newseqsdem.3.t:0 "A Rocky 60-40 Majority for the Republicans at the Polls!"
newseqsdem.3.d:0 "In a fierce hoofful of days of voting across the nation, the Vote of No Confidence has come out with a minor majority rule for the Republicans. Evidently there is still a strong minority in favor of the monarchy, and it is likely the two forms of government will be blended together in a new sort of Harmony."
newseqsdem.3.a:0 "Are those Princesses weak, or are Ponies strong?"
newseqsdem.3.b:0 "We can reconcile the new and the old, hopefully."
newseqsdem.4.t:0 "Overwhelming Landslide Victory for the Republicans!"
newseqsdem.4.d:0 "Across Equestria ponies poured into the hastily built polling offices and made it clear to themselves, the monarchy, and the world that they would have their Harmonic Republic. The only ponies who opposed the overwhelming wave of change were hardline traditionalists."
newseqsdem.4.a:0 "What will this mean for us..."
newseqsdem.4.b:0 "Well, out with the old, in with the new."
newseqsdem.5.t:0 "Passage of the Species' Rights Act"
newseqsdem.5.d:0 "Today, the concerns of worldly minded ponies and many refugees and immigrants that have been arriving within Equestria have been addressed and enshrined in law. All the civil rights and liberties granted to Equestrian ponies have been extended to all residents of Equestria regardless of race who go through a brief naturalization process."
newseqsdem.5.a:0 "Good for them."

newseqsdem.6.b:0 "Is raw capitalism the solution?"
newseqsdem.7.t:0 "Fancy Pants Elected to Office!"
newseqsdem.7.d:0 "The well known Canterlot aristocrat Fancy Pants has been elected to office on an overall conservative platform. His great diplomatic skills and deep connections will serve the nation well."
newseqsdem.7.a:0 "A conventional, charming new leader."
newseqsdem.7.b:0 "If nothing else, he's a safe bet."
newseqsdem.8.t:0 "Mayor Mare Elected to Office!"
newseqsdem.8.d:0 "The long time Ponyville mayor Ms. Mare has successfully ran for office. Known by many as a democratic political trailblazer, Ponyville being an early adopter of democracy, her proven campaigning skills won the day. But will her regional talents and charms translate well to a national position?"
newseqsdem.8.a:0 "Small time leader moving to the major league."
newseqsdem.8.b:0 "Good old democratic spearhead, wish her good luck."
newseqsdem.9.t:0 "Prince Blueblood Elected to Office!"
newseqsdem.9.d:0 "The renown war hero and prince has been elected to office, riding on the hard conservatives votes in Canterlot and his skillful defense of the nation. It is fully expected he will serve the nation well, but questions have been raised about his royal background."

newseqsdem.10.b:0 "Cheers to Equestria's future."
newseqsdem.11.t:0 "Maxos Eternal Elected to Office!"
newseqsdem.11.d:0 "The rural grassroots landowner Maxos Eternal has been elected riding on an honest and modest grassroots platform and promises of flexible and balanced policy. We expect a high approval rating surrounding his administration."
newseqsdem.11.a:0 "He seems too soft to lead."
newseqsdem.11.b:0 "Honesty, hard work, and perseverence is all we need."
newseqsdem.12.t:0 "Ledd Metal Elected to Office!"
newseqsdem.12.d:0 "The traditional guildspony and master blacksmith Ledd Metal has been elected in an unlikely victory. He championed the odd platform of reconciling the old Harmonic monarchy with the new government, riding on the support of the remaining old craftspony guilds and other political oddballs."
newseqsdem.12.a:0 "How... strange."
newseqsdem.12.b:0 "Er, we wish him best of luck."
newseqsdem.13.t:0 "Ember Spark Elected to Office!"
newseqsdem.13.d:0 "The heavily decorated Equestrian pegasus trooper Ember Spark has been elected to office on a wave of war popularity for his heroic actions and his humble attitude. A blend of a calm and collected demeanor and a genuine emphasis on defense ensures his success."

Older chiefs of this enclave country couldn't think of such a possibility, however, their heart was softened as Chieftess Strongheart spoke for friendship.

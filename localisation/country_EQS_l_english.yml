### EVENTS #####
######### EQS # EQUESTRIA ##################
 equestria.1.t:0 "Happy Hearthswarming Eve and Happy New Year!"
 equestria.1.d:0 "Several days ago all ponies celebrated Hearthswarming Eve and now the new year has come. Everypony on the streets are sharing an optimistic view on the future and wishing all strangers a happy new year, because, actually, nobody is a stranger in Equestria."
 equestria.1.a:0 "Good fun."
 equestria.2.t:0 "Buffalo Problem"
 equestria.2.d:0 "We are ready to send the official appeal of ponies and buffalo friendship to the Buffalo State. This will improve our relations with them and we will probably be hope for later cooperation and understanding. However some of our military minds are suggesting another variant of situation. Unleash the Equestrian war machine and quickly destroy the independent buffalo state in a lightning war. They suggest that this will improve our military situation overall and will provide experience for our troops, which may be useful in near future. What shall we do?"
 equestria.2.a:0 "Send the envoy. Such militaristic rhetoric does not have a place in our nation."
 equestria.2.b:0 "Start the engines, let's get this over with."
 equestria.3.t:0 "Situational Awareness"
 equestria.3.d:0 "An extensive report produced by an internal committee details a number of state issues varying from the threat of the Changelings, to Stalliongradian border disputes, to growing Griffonian tensions, to dissatisfaction of marginalised political activists within the country. In addition, the committee was responsible for valuating current government planned responses in light of these situations, and most were deemed inadequate or wholly lacking.\n\nThis came as a shock to many ponies, who view life in Equestria as being mostly tranquil and safe from the sensation of a looming threat on the horizon. As such, many opposition papers had a field day denouncing the Equestrian government and inflating its incapacity to lead the nation. While most of these are marginal and have little circulation, the facts are clear: Equestria needs to ready itself for what may yet come."
 equestria.3.a:0 "This is a wake up call."
 equestria.4.t:0 "The Academy for Gifted Unicorns"
 equestria.4.d:0 "Funds have reached the study place of well-known Twilight Sparkle, the School for Gifted Unicorns in Canterlot. Modern facilities has been bought for study and research purposes."
 equestria.4.d_sol:0 "Funds have reached the School for Gifted Unicorns in Canterlot. Modern facilities has been bought for study and research purposes."

 equestria.5.d_sol:0 "Sol Invicta Academy has received our subsidies. With that they will be able to open more places for gifted ponies in [Root.GetName]."
 equestria.5.a:0 "Good."
 equestria.6.t:0 "Public Schools Funding"
 equestria.6.d:0 "We're slowly improving our system of public schools. Equestria needs better education."
 equestria.6.a:0 "Good."
 equestria.7.t:0 "War Committee"
 equestria.7.d:0 "We have assembled a War Committee. Now we shall be able to get more ponies into higher military ranks and scientists to supervise our research."
 equestria.7.a:0 "Good."
 equestria.8.t:0 "High Command Ponies"
 equestria.8.d:0 "We've rapidly expanded our military staff. There are many talented ponies in Equestria. Let's get them to work."

 equestria.9.t:0 "Stalliongrad Cooperation"
 equestria.9.d:0 "We are ready to send a formal appeal of friendship to Stalliongrad and hope they will answer our call."

 equestria.10.t:0 "Stalliongrad accepts our proposal"
 equestria.10.d:0 "Stalliongradian officials reviewed our recent proposal and are ready to accept the terms."
 equestria.10.a:0 "Friendship!"
 equestria.11.t:0 "Diplomatic Shelter"
 equestria.11.d:0 "We are going to provide diplomatic shelter to Queen Velvet of Olenia, that has been expelled from the country by her bastard brother King Johan 'Djavulen'. Thus we're going to protect her from possible assassination attempts and hope to bring harmony to the throne of Olenia in the future."
 equestria.11.a:0 "Surely."
 equestria.12.t:0 "Accession of the Buffalo State"
 equestria.12.d:0 "Today we've gladly accepted the Buffalo State as an autonomous region of Equestria. Older chiefs of this enclave country couldn't think of such a possibility, however, the situation has changed in recent years due to Chieftess Strongheart. We celebrate unity of ponies and buffaloes today."
 equestria.12.a:0 "That's a new one."
 equestria.13.t:0 "Slowly Recovering"
 equestria.13.d:0 "Our newly appointed administration is doing its job in converting the economy of this country to war-ready state. There is already good progress, but there's still much to be done to be fully in good shape."
 equestria.13.a:0 "Now that's good news."
 equestria.14.t:0 "Magical Nukes"
 equestria.14.d:0 "Our scientists are working on ultimate weapon of war. And one of recent projects sparked their interest. It is a concept of necromantic megaspell bomb, that, in theory will have explosion capability that of many tonnes of TNT."
 equestria.14.a:0 "Sounds good to me."
 equestria.15.t:0 "Stalliongrad Declines Research Agreement"

 equestria.15.a:0 "Oh well..."
 equestria.16.t:0 "Almost recovered"
 equestria.16.d:0 "As told earlier, new administration and expanded government research progress has improved the situation well. We're producing much more. We're building faster. Ponies are ready to fight for Equestria till the end."
 equestria.16.a:0 "Good."
 equestria.17.t:0 "Stalliongrad accepts research agreement"
 equestria.17.d:0 "Stalliongradian authorities have accepted our offer of joint research. Together for Victory!"
 equestria.17.a:0 "Sweet."
 equestria.18.t:0 "Dragons decline ceding of Badlands"
 equestria.18.d:0 "Princess Ember, under pressure, was forced to not accept our offer."
 equestria.18.a:0 "We'll see."
 equestria.19.t:0 "Dragons accept"
 equestria.19.d:0 "Dragons council accepted our offer and cedes Badlands."
 equestria.19.a:0 "Right."
 equestria.20.t:0 "Dragons accept on second thought"
 equestria.20.d:0 "After visit of Spike to the Dragon's Lair, he managed to persuade to peacefully transfer Badlands to Equestria."
 equestria.20.a:0 "Way to go."
 equestria.21.t:0 "Dragons want war?"
 equestria.21.d:0 "Dragons decided to play fools and are not going to peacefully cede this wasteland to us."
 equestria.21.a:0 "Have it your way."
 equestria.22.t:0 "New Generals in the Military Staff"
 equestria.22.d:0 "Expanded conscription allowed us to find skilled ponies to lead the armies into the battle."
 equestria.22.a:0 "Good."
 equestria.25.t:0 "Dictatorship of Proletariat"
 equestria.25.d:0 "We've successfully seized the power in the country. It is time for us to seize the means of production and make the economy work for the people."
 equestria.25.a:0 "Yes."
 equestria.26.t:0 "Protection of the Homeland"
 equestria.26.d:0 "We cannot follow the magic of friendship rhetoric anymore, our homeland is under attack and we need to put all our efforts to protect it."
 equestria.26.a:0 "Aye."
 equestria.31.t:0 "Stalliongradian Propaganda Campaign"
 equestria.31.d:0 "We've been notified that Stalliongrad has started propaganda campaign in Equestria."

 equestria.32.a:0 "Crush them!"
 equestria.32.b:0 "Let them stay."
 equestria.34.t:0 "Left Rallies"
 equestria.34.d:0 "Many big cities saw communists, socialists, workers and sympathisers going on the solidarity march through the major streets. The event is dedicated to the Labour Day celebrated on 1st of May. These ponies say that they share their solidarity with all the oppressed working class creatures of the world."
 equestria.34.a:0 "Let them be."
 equestria.34.b:0 "Crush the demonstration!"
 equestria.35.t:0 "Communist Activity"
 equestria.35.d:0 "After the socialist ponies were chased down by the Royal Guards during the Labour Day demonstration, political views of the left-wing ponies turned drastically radical. Many communist newspapers were founded, many communists conduct propaganda campaign on factories and in the countryside, thus the ranks of the Ponies Communist Party are replenished with more and more ponies."
 equestria.35.a:0 "Okay."
 equestria.42.t:0 "Stalliongrad Comes to Our Aid!"
 equestria.42.d:0 "Stalliongrad has offered to aid us in the war against the Changelings regardless of the differences between our two nations. We can expect reinforcements to arrive soon from the North-East in the form of Stalliongradian tanks and troops."
 equestria.42.a:0 "Together for Victory!"
 equestria.43.t:0 "Princess Celestia abdicates!"
 equestria.43.d:0 "Following the start of the Equestrian Civil War, Princess Celestia refused to remain the leader of Equestria. She expressed her deepest sorrow for the fate of Equestria in the shade of latest events, saying that she had failed in preventing a disaster like this. She tearfully stated that she feels no longer able to reign the lands of Equestria, and that she would step back as leader of the Equestrian nation. No longer will her motherly glance caress equestrians in the morning No longer will she raise and lower the sun for them. Her reign, which has endured for over a thousand years, has come to an end. Princess Luna, shaken by this turn of events, will fill in her sister’s spot as Equestria’s leader during these dire times. Only time will tell what happens next."
 equestria.43.a:0 "Oh no."
 equestria.44.t:0 "Civil War is over!"

 equestria.100.t:0 "Civil War!"
 equestria.100.d:0 "Chaos in Canterlot. Princess Luna has become Nightmare Moon once more, whether willingly or not. She fought Celestia to a draw and before being forced to flee. With some rather misguided supporters she has created the 'Army of Night', an army of traitors to forcefully take Equestria in her name. With the Elements out of commission the Loyalist's only choice is to fight back. This will be nothing less than a full blown and bloody civil war."

 equestria.102.t:0 "Princess Luna is feeling abandoned"
 equestria.102.d:0 "With all the things going on in the world nowadays, Princess Celestia hardly spends her time with her sister Luna.

Princess Luna wishes for more attention from her sister, as she fears the dark powers will consume her once more."

 equestria.105.t:0 "Confederation of South States!"
 equestria.105.d:0 "Confederation of South Equestrian States has declared its independence in the midst of chaos of this war. They seized control of the whole Equestrian south-west. These traitors are distancing themselves from Celestia and previous Equestrian leaders."
 equestria.105.a:0 "Damn it."
 equestria.105.b:0 "They sound like my kind of ponies!"
 equestria.106.t:0 "Vanhoover Commune!"

equestriadem.8.d_db:0 "The Civil War has ended, with Princess Luna fulfilling her grim and terrible task of putting down her mad sister. Thousands are dead, and the nation has been damaged - some say, beyond repair. Those so called "Moderates" claim that it was the Monarchy and the centralisation of power in the hooves of one pony - no matter how wise and powerful - which lead to this. They are now demanding change, and a reevaluation of the role of the Princess of Equestria."

equestriadem.12.t:0 "The Princess Declines"
equestriadem.12.d:0 "Today in a shocking reversal of policy the long standing national referendum system has been repealed by order of Princess Celestia. The system in question was a rarely used mechanism of Equestrian government where ponies could bring issues of any kind to be voted upon by the wider public. Recently a measure made it through the selection process where the ponies of Equestria would vote on the future role of the monarchy. Most expected Princess Celestia to campaign in favour of the status quo or a compromise, but instead she ended the whole system. Experts are left questioning where exactly she gets the legal authority for this, and layponies are left feeling confused and betrayed."

newseqsdem.1.d:0 "Much to the surprise of both Canterlot and the Republican supporters, the Vote of No Confidence showed that there was another hidden silent majority of ponies that were for the Princesses. The Monarchy has this one extra chance to redeem themselves in the public eye, the Moderates appearing satisfied with at least receiving their vote."

newseqsdem.2.t:0 "A Rough 60-40 Majority for the Princesses!"

newseqsdem.2.a:0 "Equestrians are slow to change."
newseqsdem.2.b:0 "There will be much to debate..."
newseqsdem.3.t:0 "A Rocky 60-40 Majority for the Republicans!"
newseqsdem.3.d:0 "In a fierce hoofful of days of voting across the nation, the Vote of No Confidence has come out with a minor majority rule for the Republicans. Evidently there is still a strong minority in favour of the Monarchy, and it is likely the two forms of government will be blended together in a new sort of Harmony."
newseqsdem.3.a:0 "Are those Princesses weak, or are ponies strong?"
newseqsdem.3.b:0 "We can reconcile the new and the old, hopefully."
newseqsdem.4.t:0 "Landslide Victory for the Republicans!"
newseqsdem.4.d:0 "Across Equestria ponies poured into the hastily built polling offices and made it clear to themselves, the monarchy, and the world that they would have their Harmonic Republic. The only ponies who opposed the overwhelming wave of change were hardline traditionalists."

newseqsdem.8.t:0 "Mayor Mare Elected to Office!"
newseqsdem.8.d:0 "The long time Ponyville mayor Ms. Mare has successfully ran for office. Known by many as a democratic political trailblazer, Ponyville being an early adopter of democracy, her proven campaigning skills won the day. But will her regional talents and charms translate well to a national position?"
newseqsdem.8.a:0 "Small time leader moving to the major league."
newseqsdem.8.b:0 "Good old democratic spearhead, wish her good luck."
newseqsdem.9.t:0 "Prince Blueblood Elected to Office!"

newseqsdem.11.t:0 "Maxos Eternal Elected to Office!"

newseqsdem.11.a:0 "He seems too soft to lead."
newseqsdem.11.b:0 "Honesty, hard work, and perseverance is all we need."
newseqsdem.12.t:0 "Ledd Metal Elected to Office!"
newseqsdem.12.d:0 "The traditional guildspony and master blacksmith Ledd Metal has been elected in an unlikely victory. He championed the odd platform of reconciling the old Harmonic monarchy with the new government, riding on the support of the remaining old craftspony guilds and other political oddballs."
newseqsdem.12.a:0 "How... strange."
newseqsdem.12.b:0 "Er, we wish him best of luck."
newseqsdem.13.t:0 "Ember Spark Elected to Office!"
newseqsdem.13.d:0 "The heavily decorated Equestrian pegasus trooper Ember Spark has been elected to office on a wave of war popularity for his heroic actions and his humble attitude. A blend of a calm and collected demeanour and a genuine emphasis on defence ensures his success."

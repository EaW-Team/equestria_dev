### Ideas ###
LNS_race_war:0 "The Longswordian Bloodbath"
LNS_race_war_desc:0 "More formally known to outside observers as the Longswordian Genocide, this horrendous deed against Ponykind and common decency is being carried out by the hated Count Pallas Dusktalon and his Reformisten allies.\n\n Thankfully not everyone within Longsword is willing to simply allow the Count to go through with his plan, as both elements of the military and Pony Partisans have intensified their efforts at stopping the mad Count."
LNS_killed_officers:0 "Dead Griffons Tell No Tales"
LNS_killed_officers_desc:0 "The Reformisten officer's incompetence has made them easy targets for those who don't particularly agree with their view of things. The ending result has been numerous counts of them ending up dead in outright assassinations or "accidents." It goes without saying that replacing officers - especially multitudes of them, isn't easy and a lack of them does tend to muddle a military's efficiency..."
LNS_sabotaged_industry:0 "Sabotaged Industry"
LNS_sabotaged_industry_desc:0 "The factories contain blunt signs of continuous sabotage conducted by the resistance elements."
LNS_civil_war:0 "The Longswordian Civil War"
LNS_civil_war_desc:0 "It seems the ponies of Longsword were rather unwilling to simply let the Griffons kill them all and have risen up in arms, united by their communist ideals. Meanwhile officers in the army have organized their own resistance, intending to overthrow the bloodthirsty Count while also preventing the rebellious ponies from taking over the country."
LNS_final_push_idea:0 "The Final Push"
LNS_final_push_idea_desc:0 "It has been a painful conflict for all involved. But the final battle lines and plans have been drawn and the troops have been rallied for the final assault. One last push is all it'll take to bring this terrible Civil War to a lasting peace; forward!"
LNS_two_peoples_idea:0 "Two Cultures"
LNS_two_peoples_idea_desc:0 "The Two Cultures of Longsword have finally been united in harmony. Griffons and Ponies both maintain equal rights in every form, from working to beliefs and even freedom of marriage. While most are ecstatic and pleased at this conclusion - there still remains a slight minority of ponies who maintain their own social identity that still goes unrecognised officially by the government. While these dissidents may not take up arms, they will forever be spurned by the movement for its failure to recognise them outright."
LNS_three_peoples_idea:0 "Three Cultures"
LNS_three_peoples_idea_desc:0 "The Three Cultures of Longsword have for the first time in history been properly recognised and fully acknowledged in the eyes of the state. For as long as anyone could remember, Ponies and Griffons were the only notable "ethnics" of the state. The hidden third minority; the Posniaks had long gone with not a hint of notice from even their own pony cousins. Thanks to the victorious Communist movement, this small minority has finally achieved its greatest desire - social acceptance and recognition of its very existence. While this once troublesome group rejoices and pledges support for the government, it'll need to be given special administrative attention in the coming future just like the ponies and griffons are entitled to."
LNS_powerful_passport_idea:0 "Griffonia's Most Powerful Passport"
LNS_powerful_passport_idea_desc:0 "With SRL's brand of Communism firmly established and the population at ease, it's time to establish ourselves as the safest gateway between the Eastern Pony-Dominated woodlands of Griffonia and the Western War ravaged lands of Griffon-Dominated Griffonia. For decades it has been supremely difficult to secure safe passageway from East to West and vice versa, but our geographical position allows us to successfully exploit our stability and bring on traders and migrants from all over the continent to filter through our territory! Bringing with them all kinds of exotic and luxury goods..."
LNS_industrial_education_idea:0 "Haarsingen Mechanical Institute"
LNS_industrial_education_idea_desc:0 "Part of ensuring a sound future for the SRL and its continued industrial growth requires the education system to give preliminary courses on common tool use, maintenance, and even manufacturing when viable. A population educated in the basics of industry will set the foundation for a more industrialised tomorrow as the public and private sectors will have the know how to pursue their interests in the field."
LNS_state_services_idea:0 "State Services"
LNS_state_services_idea_desc:0 "Due to the socialist approach of the government, citizens of the nation enjoy a high agree of state sponsored and funded services ranging from free healthcare, unemployment support, and maternal leave."
LNS_controlled_unions:0 "State Controlled Unions"
LNS_controlled_unions_desc:0 "By controlling any Unions created by the working class, we can eliminate inefficienct use of state resources and also ensure construction projects aren't marred by safety procedures and limited work hours. Though, the workers themselves won't exactly be nearly as productive knowing their representation is severely limited!"
LNS_free_unions:0 "Autonomous Unions"
LNS_free_unions_desc:0 "Allowing the creation of Workers' Unions freely will ensure the loyalty and well being of workers, as well as helping to increase productivity and happiness all around. However, construction projects will be hampered by Union threats continuously, and no doubt state resources will be misused now and again under the nose of the law."
LNS_secret_services_idea:0 "Vidaus Saugumo Agentūra"
LNS_secret_services_idea_desc:0 "The VSA was secretly established early on in the revolution to initially inspect the ranks and root out possible Reformisten informants and spies as well as conduct military tribunals on troops who'd committed criminal activity after victorious operations. After the war the VSA turned over into an officially listed operational arm of the government to handle all forms of national security such as interior intelligence defense, upper law enforcement, and political correctness."
LNS_internationalism_idea:0 "Internationalism"
LNS_internationalism_idea_desc:0 "Even if Longswordian Communism lacks the fanatical and murderous zeal of other fellow Socialist Republics, there is still no excuse to not be involved in the protection of fellow foreign socialists fighting for their rights as sentient beings and as sovereign citizens in their respective nations. The Longsword Socialist Republic must pursue Internationalism, it is a baseline belief of Communism afterall!"
LNS_proper_army_idea:0 "A Proper IRA"
LNS_proper_army_idea_desc:0 "While the partisans served the cause spectacularly during the revolution and there's little reason to believe the war could've been won without them, they are still undisciplined and poorly trained rabble. For our national identity and sake of integrity the army must tighten its recruiting requirements and properly break down troops into organized units. How can we ever hope to fight another country with a citizen militia?"
LNS_partisan_legacy_idea:0 "A Partisan IRA"
LNS_partisan_legacy_idea_desc:0 "The partisans could be said to have saved this nation's citizens and with the valour they showed against impossible odds it is only fitting they make up the members of our new military. While perhaps not the best disciplined or organized, their morale is stronger and in the event of another defensive war our military will have even better experience in guerilla warfare against invaders. Not to mention, looser recruitment requirements will of course lead to a larger army..."
LNS_healing_spells_idea:0 "Mandatory Healing Magic Training"
LNS_healing_spells_idea_desc:0 "Every unicorn has undergone training to heal troops in combat situations."
LNS_proper_officer_school_idea:0 "Varėna Military Institute"
LNS_proper_officer_school_idea_desc:0 "Varėna was one of the centres for the revolution and served to be the strongest point of resistance against the Reformisten. The time has come for a proper officer academy to rise and help to create a new generation of intelligent citizens which will lead our troops into the wars of tomorrow."
LNS_plane_factory_idea:0 "Kupiškis Institute of Aviation"
LNS_plane_factory_idea_desc:0 "The war of air is the war of tomorrow. We cannot afford to ignore this new field of warfare nor can we afford aircraft at all! Having production centers specialised in aircraft fabrication will help lower the cost of these new death machines."
LNS_military_education_idea:0 "OMA Program"
LNS_military_education_idea_desc:0 "The Obligatorisches Militärisches Bildungsprogramm (Mandatory Military Training Program) aims to ensure the able-bodied part of the population is ready for reserve duty in the case of war. Effectively a basic military training draft for all adult and young adult citizens to help solve service member shortages in any future war."
LNS_a_gun_in_every_home_idea:0 "A Gun In Every Home"
LNS_a_gun_in_every_home_idea_desc:0 "What hurt the revolution most was a lack of firearms in the hands of well meaning citizens. In order to prevent a new oppressive government from ever taking hold, as well as convince foreign powers to not dare invade... It has become an interest to make weapons easier to acquire. An armed society is a polite society."
LNS_lessons_of_the_partisans_idea:0 "Lessons of the Partisans"
LNS_lessons_of_the_partisans_idea_desc:0 "The partisans went far outside the rules of warfare. Hit and run attacks, sabotage, other otherwise "dirty" tactics. We shall embrace these "cowardly" tactics and employ the former rebels into teaching us their methods. It's time we took these lessons into account and ensured they are never forgotten."
LNS_military_pensions:0 "Ruhegehalt"
LNS_military_pensions_desc:0 "Ruhegehalt refers to the wide-scale benefits citizens receive upon retiring in the nation... Or if you're a notable member of the military, this is received particularly early on in life due to the prestige of serving the state directly!"
LNS_military_police_idea:0 "Militärpolizei"
LNS_military_police_idea_desc:0 "Formerly the Police Force was comprised of civilians and ex-military personnel. Due to this there'd always be a high chance of gross unprofessionalism amongst Police Officers, with the military in control the Police will also be directly affiliated with the army. Such affiliations include harsher training and indoctrination, but the second part isn't important!"
LNS_pure_army_idea:0 "A Griffon Army"
LNS_pure_army_idea_desc:0 "Griffons have always been far more adept for war than ponies. Griffons are omnivores, have natural defenses, worse attitudes, and are cheaper to produce weapons for than ponies. It's a no brainer that Griffons should make up the core - if not the entirety of the military."
LNS_mixed_army_idea:0 "A Mixed Army"
LNS_mixed_army_idea_desc:0 "Despite the herbivore nature of ponies they've always been privy to ingenuity and some even can use magic! Despite the challenges faced with arming equines, it'd be in our best interests to exploit the strengths BOTH Griffons and Ponies each possess."
LNS_spec_ops_idea:0 "BFSD"
LNS_spec_ops_idea_desc:0 "Die Büro Für Strategische Dienstleistungen (Office for Strategic Services) will serve as the center for all citizens gifted in the art of... Well, murder. It's a cruel reality that not everyone is equal, in that regard it's important to have an arm of the government dedicated to rounding up these... Special individuals and training them."
LNS_blitzkrieg_idea:0 "Blitzkrieg!"
LNS_blitzkrieg_idea_desc:0 "The future of war is on wheel and track, not hoof and paw. The sooner we come to understand this new reality, the better we'll fair against other countries in eventual conflict. Even if we can't afford a vehicle supported military, it'll pay off to have the troops used to mobile warfare."
LNS_bureaucratic_collapse:0 "Collapsed Bureaucracy"
LNS_bureaucratic_collapse_desc:0 "Perhaps it wasn't the best idea to swap out the established bureaucracy with our own members..."
LNS_anarchy:0 "Anarchy"
LNS_anarchy_desc:0 "The police have stopped functioning, taxes aren't being paid, the Hinterlands are killing fields, employment is a foreign concept, and our currency is worth dirt... We really dropped the ball here, didn't we?"
LNS_bandit_state:0 "A Bandit State"
LNS_bandit_state_desc:0 "The economy has crashed, internal production is almost non-existent, and quality of life doesn't exist. Longsword is nothing more than a war-torn country which depends on raiding its neighbors to sustain itself."
LNS_opium_fields:0 "The Opium Fields"
LNS_opium_fields_desc:0 "Okay okay, the solution to our economic problem is we've got nothing anyone wants! Answer to that? Drugs. We'll produce lots and lots of drugs... Because nobody can resist Longsword grown Opium! They'll smoke it their grave even, bam. Economy saved!"
LNS_meatshields:0 "Slavery"
LNS_meatshields_desc:0 "Right, so nobody wants to enlist anyone and everyone who did is probably dead by now or already recruited. Say, we've got all the guns right? What's stopping us from just taking "them" and putting them to work where needed?"
LNS_meatshields_1:0 "Slavery"
LNS_meatshields_1_desc:0 "Okay we've got all the slaves we need now, time to put them to the mines or shooting anything we point at."
LNS_personal_armies_idea:0 "Personal Armies"
LNS_personal_armies_idea_desc:0 "Due to the fact there's no law nor Police..anyone who's anybody has taken to recruiting their own militias and even armies if they can afford it. The service sector of jobs is long gone, everyone's a soldier now."
LNS_hit_and_run_idea:0 "Hit and Run"
LNS_hit_and_run_idea_desc:0 "Our equipment is awful and we can barely produce anything new. We're going to need to be faster than our prey considering we'll need to be picking the battlefields, so they'll always be in our favor."
LNS_baggae_idea:0 "Baggage Trains"
LNS_baggae_idea_desc:0 "Considering we don't have a central Military Headquarters the troops will simply take everything with them while they move. The army doesn't defend anything anymore, anyway."
LNS_ace_fighters_idea:0 "The Black Dozens"
LNS_ace_fighters_idea_desc:0 "The only ones able to fly aircraft buy em' themselves, or are gifted to them. Considering that criteria exclusively consists of only those with a passion for flying... Well, they're going to be damn good at it then. It's their passion!"
LNS_napalm_idea:0 "Firebombers"
LNS_napalm_idea_desc:0 "Ah, napalm... A wonderous new invention. Easy to produce, easy to use, most would call for it to be outlawed buuut... We don't have laws! So bonus for us, then."

LNS_reassign_units:0 "Misplaced Orders"

LNS_two_peoples_desc:0 "It is an eternal fact that two cultures have existed in Longsword as long as anyone could remember; griffons and ponies.

I've gathered us today to discuss our plan of action against the increasing Black Cloak threat. Not a day passes that we don't hear about villages being burned, families slaughtered or corpses floating in the river! This has gone on long enough, what will we do about it?" \n\n"We will resist, we will fight, we will bite!", the small crowd intoned. \n\n"Glory, comrades!", Starry continued, "As I speak, our friends in Hellquill and Lake City are moving in to bring us aid! Dusktalon and his cronies will not harm innocent ponies anymore! A new dawn rises, and we will be free!". The partisans cheered and stomped their hooves in response. A glint of hope was seen in each of their eyes, for the first time in a while. They will be prepared for what is to come."

His body was dragged back to Swordsson, where it was strung up a noose in the now abandoned execution square. The vengeful Partisans cheered at the display of irony, pelting the body with rocks, manure, spoiled produce and used as target practice. \n\nAcross the country, the last of the military rebellion have laid down their arms after we've taken the fortified city of Zeldstadt. No retribution was taken against these honourable griffons, and they were allowed to peacefully leave the country, although we've tried to convince them to stay and help in reconstructing Longsword.\n\nThe victorious Partisans now face a difficult task of rebuilding Longsword in their ideal, calming the tensions between griffons and ponies, and preparing for any foreign incursions. Yet with their brilliant and fearless leader, Starry Night, the ponies feel confident in a bright future, free of hatred and tyranny."

Silvertalon, realising his efforts were in vain, stood up, gave a quick salute and left the room. The Count is worse than a brick wall! Nothing he said got to him! \n\nAs he was leaving the Count's residence, flanked by the Reformisten guards, he heard a pony screaming. Silvertalon closed his eyes and sighed. He had no real love for the ponies, but it was obvious slaughtering them senselessly would cause an even bigger disaster later on! \n\nIt is time to meet with the generals, and begin the plot to restore the honour of Longsword."

Count Dusktalon was furious and will undoubtedly sack the griffons responsible for this failure. \n\nSilvertalon has evaded the blame for sending the soldiers to Varėna, which led him and his conspirators to toast to their victory.

They were forced to give up quickly and disperse in the forests, and now the Reformisten flag flies proudly from the town hall's spire. Count Dusktalon has promoted the leading commander of the mission, and called him and his griffons "the heroes of Longsword". \n\nSilvertalon has expressed dismay his fellow conspirators at this turn of events. We did not expect this astounding victory at all."

We hereby denounce the excessive cruelty and barbarism of Count Dusktalon and his Reformisten allies. The Count is an illegitimate ruler who has no love for the people, or cares about Longsword! We invite every willing griffon and pony to join us in Zeldstadt, so we can restore the true values to Longsword!." \n\nWord spread like flame through the cities and villages, and soon enough many made their way to Zeldstadt.

By paying off the right griffons, we've been able to obtain a portion of the Reformisten's firearms, strenghtening our cause. Money is a small price to pay for ensuring the future of Longsword."

The commonfolk did not intervene as they watched this vigilante justice sporadically continue for the rest of the day. \n\nSurprisingly, the Count hasn't issued a reprisal or action against this open rebellion.

The Reformisten did not go down easily, as they used some truly despicable tactics, such as arming innocent griffon children and pretending to surrender numerous times. The mad Count himself was found barricaded in his residence, and was dragged out to the streets after a short struggle. He was summarily executed by the firing squad, screaming insults and curses as his last words. \n\nMeanwhile in the countryside, the remaining Partisans have agreed to peacefully surrender in exchange for amnesty. Their request was granted as they were fighting for their very existance - a just and noble endeavor, but now they've seen that they cannot bring their idea of change to Longsword after our victory. It will take a while to repair relations between griffons and ponies, following the years of sustained violence against the innocent ponies. \n\nSilvertalon addressed his griffons and ponies, telling them how proud he was of their courage in standing to up the cruel Reformisten, and finished by saying that our victory marks the beginning of a new age for a honourable Longsword, defender of the griffon way of life."

Our previous month's purges were not enough to contain this cancer, there is no other solution then for another round!

Ponies can never be trusted and have no business owning property or amassing any notable amount of wealth. \n\nFortunately enough we managed to bust a rising pony-dominant business district local to the city of Haarsingen too!

The ensuing explosion proceeded to collapse numerous levels of the factory before it ultimately fell in on itself from lack of support pillars. Fortunately only a lone safety inspector died, but there remains the question of how this happened... Some local loyal supporters reported the owner, "Sunny Day" was staunchly anti-Reformisten and had a history of explosives experience. If it's anyone's guess, he set up remote explosives to level his wrongly acquired property. Why didn't this come up when we were screening him and all the others earlier in the week?

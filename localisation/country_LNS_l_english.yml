### Ideas ###
LNS_race_war:0 "The Longswordian Bloodbath"
LNS_race_war_desc:0 "More formally known to outside observers as the Longswordian Genocide, this horrendous deed against Ponykind and common decency is being carried out by the hated Count Pallas Dusktalon and his Reformisten allies.\n\n Thankfully not everyone within Longsword is willing to simply allow the Count to go through with his plan, as both elements of the military and Pony Partisans have intensified their efforts at stopping the mad Count."
LNS_killed_officers:0 "Dead Griffons Tell No Tales"
LNS_killed_officers_desc:0 "The Reformisten officer's incompetence has made them easy targets for those who don't particularly agree with their view of things. The ending result has been numerous counts of them ending up dead in outright assassinations or "accidents." It goes without saying that replacing officers isn't easy and a lack of them does tend to muddle a military's efficiency..."
LNS_sabotaged_industry:0 "Sabotaged Industry"
LNS_sabotaged_industry_desc:0 "The factories contain blunt signs of continuous sabotage conducted by the resistance elements."
LNS_civil_war:0 "The Longswordian Civil War"
LNS_civil_war_desc:0 "It seems the ponies of Longsword were rather unwilling to simply let the Griffons kill them all and have risen up in arms, united by their communist ideals. Meanwhile officers in the army have organized their own resistance, intending to overthrow the bloodthirsty Count while also preventing the rebellious ponies from taking over the country."
LNS_final_push_idea:0 "The Final Push"
LNS_final_push_idea_desc:0 "It has been a painful conflict for all involved. But the final battle lines and plans have been drawn and the troops have been rallied for the final assault. One last push is all it'll take to bring this terrible Civil War to a lasting peace; forward!"
LNS_two_peoples_idea:0 "Two Cultures"
LNS_two_peoples_idea_desc:0 "The Two Cultures of Longsword have finally been united in harmony. Griffons and Ponies both maintain equal rights in every form, from working to beliefs and even freedom of marriage. While most are ecstatic and pleased at this conclusion - there still remains a slight minority of ponies who maintain their own social identity that still goes unrecognised officially by the government. While these dissidents may not take up arms, they will forever be spurned by the movement for its failure to recognise them outright."
LNS_three_peoples_idea:0 "Three Cultures"
LNS_three_peoples_idea_desc:0 "The Three Cultures of Longsword have for the first time in history been properly recognised and fully acknowledged in the eyes of the state. For as long as anyone could remember, Ponies and Griffons were the only notable "ethnics" of the state. The hidden third minority; the Posniaks had long gone with not a hint of notice from even their own pony cousins. Thanks to the victorious Communist movement, this small minority has finally achieved its greatest desire - social acceptance and recognition of its very existence. While this once troublesome group rejoices and pledges support for the government, it'll need to be given special administrative attention in the coming future just like the ponies and griffons are entitled to."
LNS_powerful_passport_idea:0 "Griffonia's Most Powerful Passport"
LNS_powerful_passport_idea_desc:0 "With SRL's brand of Communism firmly established and the population at ease, it's time to establish ourselves as the safest gateway between the Eastern Pony-Dominated woodlands of Griffonia and the Western War ravaged lands of Griffon-Dominated Griffonia. For decades it has been supremely difficult to secure safe passageway from East to West and vice versa, but our geographical position allows us to successfully exploit our stability and bring on traders and migrants from all over the continent to filter through our territory! Bringing with them all kinds of exotic and luxury goods..."
LNS_industrial_education_idea:0 "Haarsingen Mechanical Institute"
LNS_industrial_education_idea_desc:0 "Part of ensuring a sound future for the SRL and its continued industrial growth requires the education system to give preliminary courses on common tool use, maintenance, and even manufacturing when viable. A population educated in the basics of industry will set the foundation for a more industrialised tomorrow as the public and private sectors will have the know how to pursue their interests in the field."
LNS_state_services_idea:0 "State Services"
LNS_state_services_idea_desc:0 "Due to the socialist approach of the government, citizens of the nation enjoy a high agree of state sponsored and funded services ranging from free healthcare, unemployment support, and maternal leave."
LNS_controlled_unions:0 "State Controlled Unions"
LNS_controlled_unions_desc:0 "By controlling any Unions created by the working class, we can eliminate inefficienct use of state resources and also ensure construction projects aren't marred by safety procedures and limited work hours. Though, the workers themselves won't exactly be nearly as productive knowing their representation is severely limited!"
LNS_free_unions:0 "Autonomous Unions"
LNS_free_unions_desc:0 "Allowing the creation of Workers' Unions freely will ensure the loyalty and well being of workers, as well as helping to increase productivity and happiness all around. However, construction projects will be hampered by Union threats continuously, and no doubt state resources will be misused now and again under the nose of the law."
LNS_secret_services_idea:0 "Vidaus Saugumo Agentūra"
LNS_secret_services_idea_desc:0 "The VSA was secretly established early on in the revolution to initially inspect the ranks and root out possible Reformisten informants and spies as well as conduct military tribunals on troops who'd committed criminal activity after victorious operations. After the war the VSA turned over into an officially listed operational arm of the government to handle all forms of national security such as interior intelligence defense, upper law enforcement, and political correctness."
LNS_internationalism_idea:0 "Internationalism"
LNS_internationalism_idea_desc:0 "Even if Longswordian Communism lacks the fanatical and murderous zeal of other fellow Socialist Republics, there is still no excuse to not be involved in the protection of fellow foreign socialists fighting for their rights as sentient beings and as sovereign citizens in their respective nations. The Longsword Socialist Republic must pursue Internationalism, it is a baseline belief of Communism afterall!"
LNS_proper_army_idea:0 "A Proper IRA"
LNS_proper_army_idea_desc:0 "While the partisans served the cause spectacularly during the revolution and there's little reason to believe the war could've been won without them, they are still undisciplined and poorly trained rabble. For our national identity and sake of integrity the army must tighten its recruiting requirements and properly break down troops into organized units. How can we ever hope to fight another country with a citizen militia?"
LNS_partisan_legacy_idea:0 "A Partisan IRA"
LNS_partisan_legacy_idea_desc:0 "The partisans could be said to have saved this nation's citizens and with the valour they showed against impossible odds it is only fitting they make up the members of our new military. While perhaps not the best disciplined or organized, their morale is stronger and in the event of another defensive war our military will have even better experience in guerilla warfare against invaders. Not to mention, looser recruitment requirements will of course lead to a larger army..."
LNS_healing_spells_idea:0 "Mandatory Healing Magic Training"
LNS_healing_spells_idea_desc:0 "Every unicorn has undergone training to heal troops in combat situations."
LNS_proper_officer_school_idea:0 "Varėna Military Institute"
LNS_proper_officer_school_idea_desc:0 "Varėna was one of the centres for the revolution and served to be the strongest point of resistance against the Reformisten. The time has come for a proper officer academy to rise and help to create a new generation of intelligent citizens which will lead our troops into the wars of tomorrow."
LNS_plane_factory_idea:0 "Kupiškis Institute of Aviation"
LNS_plane_factory_idea_desc:0 "The war of air is the war of tomorrow. We cannot afford to ignore this new field of warfare nor can we afford aircraft at all! Having production centers specialised in aircraft fabrication will help lower the cost of these new death machines."
LNS_military_education_idea:0 "OMA Program"
LNS_military_education_idea_desc:0 "The Obligatorisches Militärisches Bildungsprogramm (Mandatory Military Training Program) aims to ensure the able-bodied part of the population is ready for reserve duty in the case of war. Effectively a basic military training draft for all adult and young adult citizens to help solve service member shortages in any future war."
LNS_a_gun_in_every_home_idea:0 "A Gun In Every Home"
LNS_a_gun_in_every_home_idea_desc:0 "What hurt the revolution most was a lack of firearms in the hands of well meaning citizens. In order to prevent a new oppressive government from ever taking hold, as well as convince foreign powers to not dare invade... It has become an interest to make weapons easier to acquire. An armed society is a polite society."
LNS_lessons_of_the_partisans_idea:0 "Lessons of the Partisans"
LNS_lessons_of_the_partisans_idea_desc:0 "The partisans went far outside the rules of warfare. Hit and run attacks, sabotage, other otherwise "dirty" tactics. We shall embrace these "cowardly" tactics and employ the former rebels into teaching us their methods. It's time we took these lessons into account and ensured they are used well."
LNS_military_pensions:0 "Ruhegehalt"
LNS_military_pensions_desc:0 "Ruhegehalt refers to the wide-scale benefits citizens receive upon retiring in the nation... Or if you're a notable member of the military, this is received particularly early on in life due to the prestige of serving the state directly!"
LNS_military_police_idea:0 "Militärpolizei"
LNS_military_police_idea_desc:0 "Formerly the Police Force was comprised of civilians and ex-military personnel. Due to this there'd always be a high chance of gross unprofessionalism amongst Police Officers, with the military in control the Police will also be directly affiliated with the army. Such affiliations include harsher training and indoctrination, but the second part isn't important!"
LNS_pure_army_idea:0 "A Griffon Army"
LNS_pure_army_idea_desc:0 "Griffons have always been far more adept for war than ponies. Griffons are omnivores, have natural defenses, worse attitudes, and are cheaper to produce weapons for than ponies. It's a no brainer that Griffons should make up the core - if not the entirety of the military."
LNS_mixed_army_idea:0 "A Mixed Army"
LNS_mixed_army_idea_desc:0 "Despite the herbivore nature of ponies they've always been privy to ingenuity and some even can use magic! Despite the challenges faced with arming equines, it'd be in our best interests to exploit the strengths BOTH Griffons and Ponies each possess."
LNS_spec_ops_idea:0 "BFSD"
LNS_spec_ops_idea_desc:0 "Die Büro Für Strategische Dienstleistungen (Office for Strategic Services) will serve as the center for all citizens gifted in the art of... Well, murder. It's a cruel reality that not everyone is equal, in that regard it's important to have an arm of the government dedicated to rounding up these... special individuals and training them."
LNS_blitzkrieg_idea:0 "Blitzkrieg!"
LNS_blitzkrieg_idea_desc:0 "The future of war is on wheel and track, not hoof and paw. The sooner we come to understand this new reality, the better we'll fair against other countries in eventual conflict. Even if we can't afford a vehicle supported military, it'll pay off to have the troops used to mobile warfare."
LNS_bureaucratic_collapse:0 "Collapsed Bureaucracy"
LNS_bureaucratic_collapse_desc:0 "Perhaps it wasn't the best idea to swap out the established bureaucracy with our own members..."
LNS_anarchy:0 "Anarchy"
LNS_anarchy_desc:0 "The police have stopped functioning, taxes aren't being paid, the Hinterlands are killing fields, employment is a foreign concept, and our currency is worth dirt... We really dropped the ball here, didn't we?"
LNS_bandit_state:0 "A Bandit State"
LNS_bandit_state_desc:0 "The economy has crashed, internal production is almost non-existent, and quality of life doesn't exist. Longsword is nothing more than a war-torn country which depends on raiding its neighbors to sustain itself."
LNS_opium_fields:0 "The Opium Fields"
LNS_opium_fields_desc:0 "Okay okay, the solution to our economic problem is we've got nothing anyone wants! Answer to that? Drugs. We'll produce lots and lots of drugs... Because nobody can resist Longsword grown opium! They'll smoke it to their grave, even. Bam, economy saved!"
LNS_meatshields:0 "Slavery"
LNS_meatshields_desc:0 "Right, so nobody wants to enlist anyone and everyone who did is probably dead by now or already recruited. Say, we've got all the guns right? What's stopping us from just taking "them" and putting them to work where needed?"
LNS_meatshields_1:0 "Slavery"
LNS_meatshields_1_desc:0 "Okay we've got all the slaves we need now, time to put them to the mines or shooting anything we point at."
LNS_personal_armies_idea:0 "Personal Armies"
LNS_personal_armies_idea_desc:0 "Due to the fact there's no law nor Police... anyone who's anybody has taken to recruiting their own militias and even armies if they can afford it. The service sector of jobs is long gone, everyone's a soldier now."
LNS_hit_and_run_idea:0 "Hit and Run"
LNS_hit_and_run_idea_desc:0 "Our equipment is awful and we can barely produce anything new. We're going to need to be faster than our prey considering we'll need to be picking the battlefields, so they'll always be in our favor."
LNS_baggae_idea:0 "Baggage Trains"
LNS_baggae_idea_desc:0 "Considering we don't have a central Military Headquarters, the troops and their slaves will simply take everything with them while they move. The army doesn't defend anything anymore, anyway."
LNS_ace_fighters_idea:0 "The Black Dozens"
LNS_ace_fighters_idea_desc:0 "The only ones able to fly aircraft buy em' themselves, or are gifted to them. Considering that criteria exclusively consists of only those with a passion for flying... Well, they're going to be damn good at it then. It's their passion!"
LNS_napalm_idea:0 "Firebombers"
LNS_napalm_idea_desc:0 "Ah, napalm... A wonderous new invention. Easy to produce, easy to use, most would call for it to be outlawed buuut... We don't have laws! So bonus for us, then."

LNS_reassign_units:0 "Misplaced Orders"

LNS_two_peoples_desc:0 "It is an eternal fact that two cultures have existed in Longsword as long as anyone could remember; griffons and ponies.

Below and above such illustrations were revolutionary slogans and sometimes lists of "crimes" commited by the Count and the Black Cloaks. The posters demanded the populace to join a "just" cause and help in overthrowing the "tyrant of Longsword" so that both griffons and ponies could be "freed from their shackles"."

To show what happens to those who support the tyrant Count and his cronies!" The partisans of both races cheered in response. "We fought against the Black Cloaks and the crusaders in the forests of our homelands for decades, far away from the major cities. This gave the enemy the impression that we are weak, that there would be no repercussion if they chose to support the destruction of the ponykind. The time has come for us to destroy such delusional fantasies!" The cheering of the partisans increased in volume and intensity with every sentence their leader spoke. "We will hunt them down in their cities and strongholds and show everyone what happens to those who choose to align themselves with the tyrants and oppressors!" The cheering turned into something that could be described as roaring. "Who will be our targets, comrade?", one of the revolutionaries asked as the ponies and griffons calmed down."

Hundreds of griffon bodies were covering the streets and squares of the Longswordian cities. Black Cloaks, knights, military commanders and administrators known for their close connections with the Count and antagonism towards ponies laid in the streets or hung from the trees, all of them sharing the same cause of death, a single deep cut in their necks. On the chest of every slain griffon was one of the symbols related to the partisans and a single word in the language of native ponies - "Revenge". The message from the revolutionaries towards the griffons of Longsword was clear. They had hunted and killed ponies for centuries, and now they would suffer the same fate."

Thousands of griffon bodies were covering the streets and squares of Longswordian cities. Black Cloaks, knights, soldiers, administrators laid butchered and mutilated. But they weren't the only ones who suffered such gruesome fate. Everyone who had even a remote connection with these groups were treated the same. Family members, friends, even those who worked and owned businesses that the Black Cloaks and knights were known to visit, all were slain in the same manner as the most fanatical supporters of the Count's genocidal policies. There was seemingly no single way of execution, as each victim was brutalized differently and to various extents. Some were simply shot or stabbed, while others were ripped apart. Though there were some things identical about these butchered carcasses. In every place where there was at least one body was located, there would always be a symbol drawn on the closest building, and the symbols would always be connected to one of the partisan groups. The message from the revolutionaries towards the griffons of Longsword was clear. They butchered the ponies for centuries, and now they would suffer the same fate."

"It seems that our terror didn’t result in Count and the Black Cloaks losing support from the population. Rather, we seem have turned them against ourselves." \n\n"A substantial percentage of the population of the country, even other ponies, don’t see us as liberators or freedom fighters anymore. They see us as bloodthirsty butchers.", Arklid, the second in command of "Varėnė" district continued where Vycolt stopped. "The population now either thinks that the Count's policies are justified, or that we are just a reflection of the Count and his Black Cloaks, just a genocidal group of lunatics with too much influence and support. In fact, already, some of our biggest supporters have cut ties with us due to our actions that night and diverted their help towards other groups which oppose Dusktalon and his cronies. If such a trend continues, I fear that our enemies might gather substantial support from the pony population which opposes us due to our actions.""

Abba smiled to himself, he couldn't stop himself from experiencing satisfaction while killing the count's servants, especially with the current circumstances. The arrogant tyrants that occupied their motherland had made a truly grave mistake this time. They dared to not only enslave the ponies, but desecrate Varėna, the holy city of the Goddess Varėnė. Such arrogance and malevolence would not be allowed to continue! Abba aimed his rifle at another griffon and pulled the trigger. He had promised that for every injustice that ponies suffered, the count's loyalists would suffer tenfold, and he was going to keep it. \n\n Abba gazed across his surroundings. The Black Cloaks, now greatly reduced, fled the city and it's surroundings. Thousands of ponies were freed from their shackles. Truly, this was a... Abba was snapped out of his thoughts by the clacking of armor to his side. He turned his head to see Ludwig sitting down next to him. "Today was truly a great victory!"

While, unfortunately, most of his high ranking subordinates have gotten away, we have managed to shoot the despotic Count! His body was dragged back to Swordsson, where it was strung up a noose in the now abandoned execution square. The vengeful Partisans cheered at the display of irony, pelting the body with rocks, manure, spoiled produce, as a form of sick and twisted target practice. \n\nAcross the country, the last of the military rebellion have laid down their arms now that we've taken the fortified city of Zeldstadt. No retribution was taken against these honourable griffons, and they were allowed to peacefully leave the country, although we've tried to convince them to stay and help in reconstructing Longsword.\n\nThe victorious Partisans now face a difficult task of rebuilding Longsword in their ideal, calming the tensions between griffons and ponies, and preparing for any foreign incursions.

Silvertalon, realising his efforts were in vain, stood up, gave a quick salute and left the room. The Count is worse than a brick wall! Nothing he said got to him! \n\nAs he was leaving the Count's residence, flanked by the Reformisten guards, he heard a pony screaming. Silvertalon closed his eyes and sighed. He had no real love for the ponies, but it was obvious slaughtering them senselessly would cause an even bigger disaster later on! \n\nIt is time to meet with the generals, and begin the plot to restore the honour of Longsword."

Count Dusktalon was furious and will undoubtedly sack the griffons responsible for this failure. \n\nSilvertalon has evaded the blame for sending the soldiers to Varėna, which led him and his conspirators to toast to their victory.

They were forced to give up quickly and disperse in the forests, and now the Reformisten flag flies proudly from the town hall's spire. Count Dusktalon has promoted the leading commander of the mission, and called him and his griffons "the heroes of Longsword". \n\nSilvertalon has expressed dismay to his fellow conspirators at this turn of events.

We invite every willing griffon and pony to join us in Zeldstadt, so we can restore the true values to Longsword!." \n\nWord spread like flame through the cities and villages, and soon enough many made their way to Zeldstadt. The people are tired of the Count's oppression!"
longsword.52.a:0 "Come and take it!"

longsword.53.t:0 "The Partisans Muster"
longsword.53.d:0 "Emboldened by our declaration of open defiance against the Reformisten, the Partisans have yet again increased their efforts in resisting and biting. They now control the area of Visaginas in all but name, and soon they'll march on Swordsson itself, seeking to establish their version of order. This is an obstruction to our plan of restoring the proper Longswordian nation, but Silvertalon is optimistic we can handle fighting a war on two fronts if we adequately prepare..."
longsword.53.a:0 "We shall be prepared for them."

longsword.54.t:0 "The Final Demonstration"
longsword.54.d:0 "This morning, the population of Longsword have awoken to a gruesome sight - griffon bodies lying in the streets, hanging from tree branches, shot in their homes and workplaces! However, it was quickly realised all of these griffons were connected to the hateful Reformisten, whether they were full members or voluntary collaborateurs. The commonfolk did not intervene as they watched this vigilante justice sporadically continue for the rest of the day. \n\nSurprisingly, the Count hasn't issued a reprisal or action against this open rebellion. Perhaps he was fearful of justice, as well."
longsword.54.a:0 "Their days are numbered."

longsword.55.t:0 "Spring Cleaning"
longsword.55.d:0 "The issue at claw cannot be ignored anymore, which led to Silvertalon gathering his staff to discuss the plan for disrupting the increasing Partisan activity. While everygriff agrees to divert some of our resources and soldiers into harassing the Partisans, there is no clear consensus on what method shall we use. Should we order our soldiers to raid areas known for Partisan recruitment, or send saboteurs to their armouries containing their precious stockpiles?"
longsword.55.a:0 "Target their recruitment centres!"

longsword.56.t:0 "The Long March"
longsword.56.d:0 "The preparations were completed, and now the loyalist columns of griffons and ponies proudly stood at attention outside of Zeldstadt. They've girded themselves in the traditional colours of Longswordian knightly orders to distinguish themselves apart from the despised Reformisten. \n\n"Griffons, ponies, citizens!", Silvertalon adressed his soldiers, "This is our time! The madgriff of Longsword hides in his city, fearful of our retribution. For too long has this unwarranted butchery been allowed to continue, and now we shall finish our task and reclaim our country! Glory and honour to the true defenders of Longsword!" \n\nWith the speech concluded, the solders set off to march on Swordsson, with the true ideals of Longsword in their hearts and minds. The war for Longsword has begun!"
longsword.56.a:0 "To arms!"

longsword.57.t:0 "Silvertalon's Triumph"
longsword.57.d:0 "Conrad Silvertalon stood in Swordsson's central square, now filled with rubble after heavy artillery bombardment. After a hard and brutal fight, the civil war for Longsword has been finally concluded in their favour. The Reformisten did not go down easily, as they used some truly despicable tactics, such as arming innocent griffon children and pretending to surrender numerous times. The mad Count himself was found barricaded in his residence, and was dragged out to the streets after a short struggle. He was summarily executed by the firing squad, screaming insults and curses as his last words. \n\nMeanwhile in the countryside, the remaining Partisans have agreed to peacefully surrender in exchange for amnesty. Their request was granted as they were fighting for their very existance - a just and noble endeavor, but now they've seen that they cannot bring their idea of change to Longsword after our victory. It will take a while to repair relations between griffons and ponies, following the years of sustained violence against the innocent ponies. \n\nSilvertalon addressed his griffons and ponies, telling them how proud he was of their courage in standing to up the cruel Reformisten, and finished by saying that our victory marks the beginning of a new age for a honourable Longsword, defender of the griffon way of life."

They refuse to accept their proper place, they refuse to acknowledge the superiority of the Griffon race! We cannot realise our full potential with their kind around, they must all be put to the sword!" \n\nAs his speech concluded, the riled up Reformisten began screaming for death to all the ponies and fired celebratory shots from their rifles to the sky.

If we're ever going to achieve our dream of a pure Longsword, we're going to start with rooting out filth from the most prestigious ranks of our beloved military... Which will of course be pivotal to our dream as well! We can't order the troops to eliminate those overgrown rats if one is leading them or worse, a pureblood Longswordian sympathizing with them! It'll be no issue swapping out these talentless fools with members of our own beloved organization. Reformisten members are the purest of Longsword, obviously we'd be the most fit to rule every office of government."

The process has been rather swell with plenty of "loyal" pony officers being relieved of their station at the barrel of a gun. As expected, news of these dismissals haven't appeared as we can't have the prey throwing a tantrum at us retaking our country back. It's our birthright! These oversized rats have no place here, afterall. Though... Trouble in paradise has reared its ugly head in a few recent occasions where regular patrols and even training exercises have ended in deadly accidents for our new officers. \n\nBe it a patrol ending with some vile bandits, or lone communists shooting an officer dead, or a mortar test fire going way off trajectory and killing some key personnel there has been some sketchy incidents happening. We don't know exactly what's going on but it's a cause for alarm..."

After a tedious month in waiting the time has arrived for our brand new pure minded Longsword military to roll out into the open public and begin a social purification of our enemies! Communist, pony, any other brand of traitor... All will be purged one way or another. From the public hourly hangings in the Capital, to the numerous executions happening in the countryside. There is plentiful mass graves to be filled, and more than enough ammunition for such a task. There will be no shortage of treasonous rats here, nor will there be a shortage of Reformisten warriors!"

longsword.66.d:0 "Well... We underestimated the strength of the resistance and it seems they were waiting for this moment to strike out. Barely a week has passed since we began our social cleansing, and already there has been numerous organised retaliations across the more disloyal provinces of the country. Town squares being overrun outright with any government workers or Reformisten members getting shot, hanged, or worse. These Partisan animals have struck hard in our moment of glory, we'll need to regroup and plan another string or executions lest we lose momentum and control of the situation. \n\nThe Resistance is a very, very real threat..."

There's far too many of these reports to even count off as genuine too... it's... almost as if... \n\nThat's it! The military is still compromised! Our previous month's purges were not enough to contain this cancer, there is no other solution then for another round! There is no other explanation for these numerous "disappearances" than to proclaim we have not been thorough enough... \n\nWe must act quick, in fact quick is an understatement! We must act now!"

longsword.68.t:0 "Bureaucratic Cleanup"
longsword.68.d:0 "Much like the army, the bureaucracy is littered with vile ponies and equine sympathizing Longswordians. If not for the Reformisten, the entirety of Longsword's government would be overrun with these traitors in the span of a decade! If we're going to undo the damage done we'll need to work fast. There is plentiful pure-bred griffons willing to serve the country in its best interest, and there is still plenty traitors to replace. For a pure future we'll need a pure government!"
longsword.68.a:0 "With the traitors gone, we can finally run this nation properly!"

longsword.69.t:0 "Bureaucratic Collapse"
longsword.69.d:0 "Astonishingly... Governmental efficiency has taken a complete nosedive. Tax collectors are collecting for themselves and not the Government. Governors are propping up ridiculous laws on a whim with no grounding in reality. The Foreign Relations Department is in complete collapse. Newly emplaced town officials have directed government money into their own bank accounts and if they haven't; they have not a clue as to what to do. Nearly every recently replaced position has been filled by a Reformisten member that either has little experience for the job, ill-intents for their duty, or... Both of those issues! Did nobody do a screening process for this!?"
longsword.69.a:0 "That wasn't meant to happen..."

longsword.70.t:0 "A Lesson to the Disloyal"
longsword.70.d:0 "In order to properly create the pure Longswordian state we promised to our fellow griffons, we must appropriate the now illegally owned pony businesses and property to be better handled by loyal Longswordian citizens. Of course much of these lands and buildings will have to be operated by the government until a buyer is found, regardless of whichever it will still be better for the country at large. Ponies can never be trusted and have no business owning property or amassing any notable amount of wealth. \n\nFortunately enough we managed to bust a rising pony-dominant business district local to the city of Haarsingen too! If not for our intervention, there's no telling how much worse that infection would've gotten..."
longsword.70.a:0 "Now we can put those factories to good use!"

longsword.71.t:0 "An Explosion in Haarsingen"
longsword.71.d:0 "As of this morning, merely two days after the seizure of Haarsingen's "Sunny Days" industrial district a series of explosions went off. The series, type, and areas of damage were all too organised to have been some freak accident. The ensuing explosion proceeded to collapse numerous levels of the factory before it ultimately fell in on itself from lack of support pillars. Fortunately only a lone safety inspector died, but there remains the question of how this happened... Some local loyal supporters reported the owner, "Sunny Day" was staunchly anti-Reformisten and had a history of explosives experience. If it's anyone's guess, he set up remote explosives to level his wrongly acquired property. Why didn't this come up when we were screening him and all the others earlier in the week? Someone find this rat and KILL him!"

longsword.72.d:0 "The prisons are flooded with criminal ponies as of recent weeks. Our efforts to rid ourselves of their degeneracy have been so effective that we've simply run out of room to put them! Thankfully a great-minded member in our midst has come to the bright idea of putting the scum in work camps and making sure they're useful until death! An even better idea was came to in the same discussion to open it near Varėna! That way we'll no doubt break the sympathizer stronghold in the city and also eliminate logistical issues considering many of the prisoners are from that damned city too... Smart thinking, everyone!"
longsword.72.a:0 "We're finally putting those oversized vermin to use!"

longsword.73.t:0 "An Unfortunate Situation"
longsword.73.d:0 "Contrary to previous beliefs the idea to open up a forced labor camp so near to a city chock full of anti government supporters wasn't the best idea. It didn't take long for local Partisan cells to gather up and launch an organised operation on our brand new camp, killing much of its guard and outright overrunning the area before freeing anyone already interned there and recruiting anyone willing to join the growing resistance. What is wrong with these creeps? We've killed so many of them and they just seem to get angrier! Is anything ever going to break their will?!"
longsword.73.a:0 "What are we doing?! Send in the troops! NOW!"

longsword.74.t:0 "The Flaws in Our Plan"
longsword.74.d:0 ""This is a nightmare, it's an absolute nightmare!", Count Dusktalon wailed as he sat at his desk. Face in claws as he sobbed pitifully. His best laid plans had backfired every step of the way. "Every precaution was taken! The traitorous elements in the army were eliminated to begin with!", he continued to rant and wave. His ever trusty second in command, Rosa Heidenreich stood idle by the door with her lips pursed into a slight frown, gaze averted from the pitiful state of her benefactor and leader. "We massacred them by the hundreds! By the THOUSANDS, Arcturus damn them all!" \n\nRosa's right claw tightened into a firm fist as this went on and on and... on! The Count had always been her benefactor and truly she appreciated it, but as time progressed, it was a grim reality to realize how awful of a leader Dusktalon really was. She agreed with his dreams but his methods? Inefficient, unstable, unadaptive! Maybe she'd be best fit for the role...but such traitorous thoughts were often eliminated from her mind. But she couldn't lie, it was beginning to become increasingly difficult to push such thoughts out of her mind as they appeared near daily now. \n\nSuddenly enough the Count's fist slammed down onto his table hard enough to shake everything sitting upon it. His favorite snowglobe falling off its edge and onto the floor to shatter into pieces. He hadn't shed a tear over it shockingly enough, his mind was focused on larger things. "Rally my staff! Rally the commanders! Rally everyone! The Reformisten will not stand for this offence, and for that we will strike back tenfold for every dent put into her plans!", the Count bellowed loud and proud, enough so to catch Rosa's direct attention finally. "Rosa, if you'll excuse me I have to clean up here, now go. Time is of the essence!" \n\nShe would've offered words of wisdom in how this wasn't the best response to these incidents but she knew he was too set in his ways. Still, he was her superior and as such she had to continue following his orders...unfortunately. "Of course, my Count.""

We don't know where they're getting these weapons from as there hasn't been any raids on supply depots across the country, regardless this situation must be addressed immediately as the city has always been a prime breeding ground for the pony filth that infects our proud country. No doubt the resistance will attempt to recruit as many as it can into its ramshackle forces. Perhaps encircling the city and starving them out might work? Urban warfare has... recently shown to be a very bloody business..."
longsword.75.a:0 "Overgrown rats!"

longsword.76.t:0 "The Zeldstadt Mutiny"
longsword.76.d:0 "Bastard Silvertalon has struck! He and his army of pigs have seized Zeldstadt during a Night assault in the hopes of breaking the back of our purist movement! Fortunately we TRUE Longswordians are tougher than these fakes and pony filth believe us to be. Regardless of our tenacity it does not take away from how terrible a blow this is to our cause. Even with a prepared defense of Zeldstadt it was not enough as Silvertalon's forces were larger than we had ever expected. The Reformisten's forces have been stretched thin and we're in a very terrible position. There's no telling how much longer we can stave off a complete morale collapse in the troops if the situation does not turn around soon... My Count! What are your orders to put down these swine?"
longsword.76.a:0 "We will march on Zeldstadt and DROWN them in their own blood!"

longsword.77.t:0 "A Country in Chaos"
longsword.77.d:0 "Count Dusktalon sat slumped in his office, head nested in claws. Outside, the sounds of rioting and battle spread, as the Reformisten were trying to contain the rebels. He wasn't a weeping sort, but even he had to admit Boreas seemingly turned His back on them. \n\nWhere did everything go so wrong? His orders were clear, his subordinates were loyal and willing, he brought purity to Longsword! Quickly, he remembered - those damned ponies, they were the cause behind everything! The factories, Silvertalon, the arms shipments, his standing with von Katerinburg - everything! Somehow, their corrupting magic seeped into every aspect of his nation. \n\nDusktalon reached for the drawer and took his reliable pistol. Did anything really matter, as long as he had enough bullets for his enemies? His resolve restored, he called for Heidenreich to join him. Orders will be made, and the Reformisten will prevail, for each of them fights with Arcturus by his side!"
longsword.77.a:0 "Longsword shall be a pure nation! Wir sind unnachgiebig!"

longsword.78.t:0 "Your Eternal Reward"
longsword.78.d:0 "The country laid in ruins. Cities were razed, villages and forests were burned, farmlands were despoiled, the triumphant Count spared none in his quest to purify Longsword. Even the victorious Reformisten were starting to have second thoughts about this plan, but they were kept in check by their zealous superiors. Longsword was purified... at a heavy cost. \n\nThe hastily erected fortifications of Zeldstadt were no match for the Reformisten onslaught, as they broke through and mercilessly slaughtered the loyalist soldiers. Conrad Silvertalon was found in his room, lying dead at the command table, pistol in his claws. The surviving commanders were quickly executed. \n\nVisaginas' forests were burning as the Reformisten were driving out the ponies, by any means necessary. For all their effort, Starry Night and most of the Partisans were able to flee across the border to Lake City, their escape covered by ponies and griffons who sacrificed themselves to enable it. In the end, it could reasonably be said not a single pony was left in Longsword. \n\nAfter all these years, setbacks and outright revolts, Count Pallas Dusktalon considered his dream fulfilled. Sure, he had to destroy most of the country to accomplish that, but did that matter once von Katerinburg learned of his success? Surely he'd get richly rewarded, maybe even gain a higher title! Now all that's left is for Rosa Heidenreich to send the letter to Hellquill, reporting of their success. \n\nOn the other claw, Rosa herself was feeling disillusioned by this outcome. The Reformisten cause is self destructive, they have no future... Perhaps she can still make the final decision of this civil war."

In it, Pallas Dusktalon explained in great detail how he has "personally slain the traitor scum with his own claws" and "established the purest nation in all of Griffonia". While Dusktalon is known to be a coward and a blowhard, the fact remains that the Reformisten are the winners in the Longswordian civil war. It's anyone's guess how he had managed to win, but nonetheless plans have been drawn to quickly integrate the Longswordian lands into our own, so that together we may prepare for the final conflict against the ponies..."
longsword.79.a:0 "Assign Dusktalon to our most remote outpost..."

longsword.80.t:0 "A New Dawn"
longsword.80.d:0 "Count Dusktalon sat gleefully in his office, writing of his many victories, until he was interrupted by Heidenreich and a small group of other high ranking Reformisten. \n\n"What is the meaning of this, Heidenreich? I haven't summoned you." The group exchanged quick glances before Heidenreich spoke: "Dusktalon, this cannot go on anymore. The country is ruined, we went too far and accomplished nothing worth boasting about. It is time for you to step down", disappointment clear in her tone. \n\nThe nerve of this griffon! He has achieved his dream and so much more, and now she wants to throw it all away?! He stood up and started screeching: "Heidenreich, how dare you intefere in our sacred du-", but he didn't get to finish as one of the conspirators shot him in the head. \n\nWord of this event quickly spread, and anarchy ensued as the Reformisten turned on each other in brutal infighting. The following week saw many violence and destruction of what was left in Longsword, until a semblance of order was restored by Heidenreich and her close supporters. She has some radical changes in mind for Longsword."

LNS_race_war_desc:0 "More formally known to outside observers as the Longswordian Genocide, this horrendous deed against Ponykind and common decency is being carried out by the hated Count Pallas Dusktalon and his Reformisten allies.\n\nThankfully not everyone within Longsword is willing to simply allow the Count to go through with his plan, as both elements of the military and Pony Partisans have intensified their efforts at stopping the mad Count."
LNS_killed_officers:0 "Dead Griffons Tell No Tales"
LNS_killed_officers_desc:0 "The Reformisten officer's incompetence has made them easy targets for those who don't particularly agree with their view of things. The ending result has been numerous counts of them ending up dead in outright assassinations or "accidents." It goes without saying that replacing officers isn't easy and a lack of them does tend to muddle a military's efficiency..."
LNS_sabotaged_industry:0 "Sabotaged Industry"
LNS_sabotaged_industry_desc:0 "The factories contain blunt signs of continuous sabotage conducted by the resistance elements."
LNS_civil_war:0 "The Longswordian Civil War"
LNS_civil_war_desc:0 "It seems the ponies of Longsword were rather unwilling to simply let the Griffons kill them all and have risen up in arms, united by their communist ideals.

LNS_final_push_idea:0 "The Final Push"
LNS_final_push_idea_desc:0 "It has been a painful conflict for all involved. But the final battle lines and plans have been drawn and the troops have been rallied for the final assault. One last push is all it'll take to bring this terrible Civil War to a lasting peace; forward!"

LNS_plane_factory_idea:0 "Kupiškis Institute of Aviation"
LNS_plane_factory_idea_desc:0 "The war of air is the war of tomorrow. We cannot afford to ignore this new field of warfare nor can we afford aircraft at all! Having production centers specialised in aircraft fabrication will help lower the cost of these new death machines."

LNS_bandit_state:0 "A Bandit State"
LNS_bandit_state_desc:0 "The economy has crashed, internal production is almost non-existent, and quality of life doesn't exist. Longsword is nothing more than a war-torn country which depends on raiding its neighbors to sustain itself."
LNS_opium_fields:0 "The Opium Fields"
LNS_opium_fields_desc:0 "Okay okay, the heart of our economic problem is we've got nothing anyone wants! Answer to that? Drugs. We'll produce lots and lots of drugs... Because nobody can resist Longsword grown opium! They'll smoke it to their grave, even. Bam, economy saved!"
LNS_meatshields:0 "Slavery"
LNS_meatshields_desc:0 "Right, so nobody wants to enlist anyone and everyone who did is probably dead by now or already recruited. Say, we've got all the guns right? What's stopping us from just taking "them" and putting them to work where needed?"
LNS_meatshields_1:0 "Slavery"

LNS_personal_armies_idea:0 "Personal Armies"
LNS_personal_armies_idea_desc:0 "Due to the fact there's no law nor Police... anyone who's anygriffon or anypony has taken to recruiting their own militias and even armies if they can afford it. The service sector of jobs is long gone, everyone's a soldier now."
LNS_hit_and_run_idea:0 "Hit and Run"
LNS_hit_and_run_idea_desc:0 "Our equipment is awful and we can barely produce anything new. We're going to need to be faster than our prey considering we'll need to be picking the battlefields, so they'll always be in our favour."
LNS_baggae_idea:0 "Baggage Trains"
LNS_baggae_idea_desc:0 "Considering we don't have a central Military Headquarters, the troops and their slaves will simply take everything with them while they move. The army doesn't defend anything anymore, anyway."

LNS_ace_fighters_idea_desc:0 "The only ones able to fly aircraft buy 'em themselves, or are gifted them. Considering that criteria exclusively consists of only those with a passion for flying... Well, they're going to be damn good at it then. It's their passion!"
LNS_napalm_idea:0 "Firebombers"

LNS_proper_army_idea_desc:0 "While the partisans served the cause spectacularly during the revolution and there's little reason to believe the war could've been won without them, they are still undisciplined and poorly trained rabble.

LNS_healing_spells_idea:0 "Mandatory Healing Magic Training"
LNS_healing_spells_idea_desc:0 "Every unicorn has undergone training to heal troops in combat situations. It is not enough to completely restore them to fighting condition, but rather stabilise the wounds so that soldiers won't pass away waiting for a proper response."
LNS_innovative_military:0 "An Innovative Military"
LNS_innovative_military_desc:0 "Winning wars cannot be done solely by brave soldiers and talented commanders, but rather with the assistance of strategists, logisticians and more, who work tirelessly in the background, providing the latest in technology and tactics."
LNS_ILKS:0 "The ILKS"
LNS_ILKS_desc:0 "Intended more as a propaganda tool than an actual threat, the ILKS makes preparations for the possible event of Longsword yielding to foreign invasion. If they want our land, then they will have to pay the blood price."

LNS_controlled_unions:0 "State Atheism"
LNS_controlled_unions_desc:0 "Longsword of the past has been piously devoted to its religion - but the Longsword of today has no need for it. Traditional worship will be discouraged, both quietly and forcefully, and the state will no longer provide any funding or resources for such organisations."
LNS_free_unions:0 "Freedom of Religion"
LNS_free_unions_desc:0 "A creature's personal belief should not be mandated or influenced by the state, rather, each should be free to make their own decision on what they consider the most spiritually satisfying, as long as it doesn't infringe on the rights of others."
LNS_secret_services_idea:0 "Vidaus Saugumo Agentūra"
LNS_secret_services_idea_desc:0 "The VSA was secretly established early on in the revolution to initially inspect the ranks and root out possible Reformisten informants and spies as well as conduct military tribunals on troops who'd committed criminal activity after victorious operations. After the war the VSA turned over into an officially listed operational arm of the government to handle all forms of national security such as interior intelligence defense, upper law enforcement, and political correctness."
LNS_internationalism_idea:0 "Internationalism"
LNS_internationalism_idea_desc:0 "Even if Longswordian Communism lacks the fanatical and murderous zeal of other fellow Socialist Republics, there is still no excuse to not be involved in the protection of fellow foreign socialists fighting for their rights as sentient beings and as sovereign citizens in their respective nations.

LNS_two_peoples_idea:0 "Two Cultures"
LNS_two_peoples_idea_desc:0 "The Two Cultures of Longsword have finally been united in harmony. Griffons and Ponies both maintain equal rights in every form, from working to beliefs and even freedom of marriage. While most are ecstatic and pleased at this conclusion - there still remains a slight minority of ponies who maintain their own social identity that still goes unrecognised officially by the government. While these dissidents may not take up arms, they will forever be spurned by the movement for its failure to recognise them outright."
LNS_three_peoples_idea:0 "Three Cultures"
LNS_three_peoples_idea_desc:0 "The Three Cultures of Longsword have for the first time in history been properly recognised and fully acknowledged in the eyes of the state. For as long as anyone could remember, Ponies and Griffons were the only notable "ethnics" of the state. The hidden third minority; the Posniaks had long gone with not a hint of notice from even their own pony cousins. Thanks to the victorious Communist movement, this small minority has finally achieved its greatest desire - social acceptance and recognition of its very existence. While this once troublesome group rejoices and pledges support for the government, it'll need to be given special administrative attention in the coming future just like the ponies and griffons are entitled to."
LNS_a_gun_in_every_home_idea:0 "A Gun In Every Home"
LNS_a_gun_in_every_home_idea_desc:0 "What hurt Longsword most was a lack of firearms in the hooves and claws of well meaning citizens. This shall be amended and repaired. An armed society is a polite society."
LNS_land_reform_1:0 "Reformed Land Ownership"
LNS_land_reform_1_desc:0 "In accordance with the socialist ethos, laws regarding land ownership have been restructured to benefit more the common pony and griffon. Having been lessened of many burdens, production and population is sure to grow."
LNS_collectivization_idea:0 "Agrarian Socialist Economy"
LNS_collectivization_idea_desc:0 "The Longswordian pony has always been connected to the land he toils, and has always lived in communes and collective societies where each individual lives off their labor and helps their comrades in need.

LNS_integral_liberation_desc:0 "Freed from the shackles of their racial divide and seeing each other as creatures, not as ponies, griffons, or any other species, the inhabitants of a new Griffonia will finally be liberated from death and want.

LNS_civil_war_recovery:0 "Recovery from the Civil War"
LNS_civil_war_recovery_desc:0 "Longsword has seen great destruction and bloodshed in the past - but the most recent one has been the worst of its kind.

LNS_riverfed_abolished:0 "Treaty of Coltstream Abolished"

LNS_newfound_fervor_desc:0 "The ponies of Vartai are considered to be rather set in their ways, be it the old ways or new ones they have adopted, they often would rather suffer or even perish than accept a perceived enforced change upon them.\n\nHowever it seems that the Posniak conversion campaigns designed by Abba Povner and Kerštininkai to bring these griffon god worshipping ponies to right and proper path don't seem to be encountering such issues and are even going into an opposite direction as these newly converted ponies become far more radical and militant than even many of those who were born and grew up believers of the old faith."
LNS_return_to_genesis:0 "Becoming Whole Again"
LNS_return_to_genesis_desc:0 "When Grover II marched east, crushing Duke Žemaitukas under his countless hordes, he pushed many a pony out of their homes with his campaigns of destruction. Even after he was defeated and his armies pushed back, the Vartai remained under griffon control which ensured a slow, yet steady stream of native ponies fleeing griffon domination and enforced Herzlander-Imperial culture. The rise of Black Cloaks only increased the fervour of this retreat as tens of thousands left for better lives in various states of Riverlands. Some of these outcasts or their descendants came back to assist during the civil war, forming several minor military units which by themselves didn't contribute much to our forces.\n\nHowever something seems to have changed rather soon after Povner assumed control. Outcasts, exiles, refugees and their descendants started flooding back into Longsword, answering calls to return to their homeland seemingly en masse.\n\nWhile this rapid flood of, seeming, believers of Varėnė is allowing for a somewhat rapid increase of our military forces and settling previously devastated lands, many ponies that persisted within Longsword seem somewhat bitter that those who fled in fear or their descendants are being accepted back. While this doesn't seem to by anything that would lead to substantial inner strife, the antagonism between both groups is noticeable."
LNS_griffon_converts:0 "The Reborn"
LNS_griffon_converts_desc:0 "While Abba Povner is usually a rather cold and lacking in charisma individual, there are a couple occasions where this changes, that being either when the "Soldier of the Gods" is writing or reciting his poetry which has captured and enveloped the minds of many, or when he speaks of the will of Varėnė and other gods and the native faith of Vartai. Perhaps it was through such means that Povner reached the minds and hearts of the countless knights that lost faith in the griffon creator gods and any sort of noble ideal that might have existed in their homelands.\n\nWhatever is the case, there are now entire legions of griffon knights that have removed any symbol of country or house ready to fight for Varėnė and her faithful and train any new armies of newly converted griffon believers."

### National Focuses ###
LNS_resist_and_bite:0 "Resist and Bite"
LNS_resist_and_bite_desc:0 "The time has come to face the grim reality. Dusktalon and his Reformisten lackeys shall stop at nothing to exterminate us... Thus we must fight, and fight we shall! We will fight him in the forests, in the streets and on the fields! We may fail, we may all die, but one thing is for certain we will resist and we will bite!"
LNS_our_friends_in_hellquill:0 "Assistance from Hellquill"
LNS_our_friends_in_hellquill_desc:0 "We're ready to receive support from our comrades in Hellquill, but first, a group of volunteers must pass through the town of Kupiškis to reach Beakstadt. The Reformisten's influence is weak there, but that doesn't mean we're completely safe from harm."
LNS_target_collaborators:0 "Target the Collaborators"
LNS_target_collaborators_desc:0 "It would be a lie to claim that everygriff follows the mad count in his extermination plan, but the majority still supports him either actively or passively. They must be shown that you can't collaborate with murderers, and get away with it."
LNS_spread_pamphlets:0 "Spread the Word"
LNS_spread_pamphlets_desc:0 "We shall print pamphlets and posters containing our ideas and reasons to oppose the Black Cloaks. Under the cover of night, they will be distributed across the cities."
LNS_steal_equipment:0 "Steal Their Guns"
LNS_steal_equipment_desc:0 "To have a reasonable chance at victory, we must secure enough firearms for our troops. We've found two locations from which we can seize weapons, both of which will weaken the Refomisten in achieving their wicked goals."
LNS_organize_cells:0 "Prepare for the Inevitable"
LNS_organize_cells_desc:0 "Sooner or later, we'll end up in an open conflict with the Reformisten. We excel at guerrilla warfare, but we must recruit additional ponies for the cause and increase our training regimen for the real fight."
LNS_the_secret_government:0 "The Secret Government"
LNS_the_secret_government_desc:0 "To ensure a smooth transition after we depose the Reformisten, it is necessary to form a shadow government. They'll assume key positions after our victory in the field, and immediately set work upon rebuilding Longsword and prevent anarchy from breaking out."
LNS_sabotage_them:0 "Sabotage!"
LNS_sabotage_them_desc:0 "We must intensify our efforts in harassing the Reformisten. If they are sufficiently weakened, we can expect a brief battle on the field. Targeting their leaders and production centres will help in this regard, although we cannot spare resources to target both at once."
LNS_an_example:0 "A Show of Force"
LNS_an_example_desc:0 "Outrage! The Black Cloaks have crowded innocent ponies in labour camps in Varėna! We must respond to this immediately before they are slaughtered, or worse!"
LNS_the_uprising:0 "The Visaginas Uprising"
LNS_the_uprising_desc:0 "To arms, ponies! Dusktalon and his cronies are going to pay for their crimes! Longsword will be free of their tyranny! For Ilgakardija and her heroic fighters!"

LNS_the_military_resists:0 "Oppose the Count"
LNS_the_military_resists_desc:0 "We've had enough of the Count's madness. Slaughter of innocent ponies isn't what Longsword stands for! Conrad Silvertalon, our highest decorated general, will approach Dusktalon and attempt to convince him to end this butchery."
LNS_reassign_units:0 "Misplaced Orders"
LNS_reassign_units_desc:0 "Silvertalon has intercepted orders for the military from the Count and has "accidently" lost them. They will be replaced with ones more suitable to our growing resistance and more resistant to attempts to win them over from the Reformisten."
LNS_our_duty:0 "Prepare for the Fight Ahead"
LNS_our_duty_desc:0 "Every one of us is committed to liberating Longsword from the Reformisten menace, but first we must adequately prepare, if we are to openly oppose them. The streets of Zeltstadt and other towns in the area have labyrinthine streets and nooks that can be exploited, should they come to visit."
LNS_ensure_loyalty:0 "Cull Reformisten in the Army"
LNS_ensure_loyalty_desc:0 "The extremist elements in the Rosewood Order need to be removed, otherwise they'll endanger our plans to bring back peace to Longsword. If a few key officers could just be removed by various means, once the fight comes, their lack of presence would be a certain loss for the Count."
LNS_black_market_contacts:0 "Arms Shipment Diversion"
LNS_black_market_contacts_desc:0 "We've convinced sympathetic griffons from the Heartlands to deliver the next weapon transport to Zeltstadt. Containing many of the newest weapons, it will be a boon to us, what we can take at least."
LNS_requisition_weapons:0 "Weapons for the Cause"
LNS_requisition_weapons_desc:0 "With the Reformisten tightly controlling most of the firearm production, we're forced to seek more clandestine methods of equipping our troops. Perhaps, maybe, we can persuade some weaker links in the chain to break."
LNS_refuse_orders:0 "Open Resistance"
LNS_refuse_orders_desc:0 "We've built up our strength to a sufficient amount to openly defy the Reformisten. All those loyal to our cause will be instructed to gather at Zeltstadt with what weapons they can find. We will gather out forces and prepare for the storm ahead."
LNS_target_reformisten:0 "Target Black Cloaks"
LNS_target_reformisten_desc:0 "The Reformisten are a blight on our country's good name. We shall murder their supporters wherever we find them, and make others think twice before joining them. Perhaps a little off-the-book justice meted out in the night will work..."
LNS_target_partisans:0 "The Partisan Issue"
LNS_target_partisans_desc:0 "While the Reformisten are our main enemy, the Partisans have been gearing up for open conflict, as well. We sympathise with the ponies, but their radical members will undoubtedly instruct them to attack us. Some effort will be divested towards weakening them."
LNS_the_madgriffon_of_longsword:0 "March Upon Swordsson"
LNS_the_madgriffon_of_longsword_desc:0 "Let the Earth tremble as the righteous forces of Longsword marches on Swordsson. We shall desail the Reformisten bastion, and burn it to the ground. Let those that commit the crimes against all be met with the sword."

LNS_the_plan_continues:0 "The Plan Continues"
LNS_the_plan_continues_desc:0 "The pathetic ponies have breathed their last! We will not stop until the last pony is dead and buried! Glory to the Reformisten, our saviours!"
LNS_investigate_the_military:0 "Investigate the Commanders"
LNS_investigate_the_military_desc:0 "Some of our generals are insufficiently loyal to our cause. They will be replaced with more suitable griffons, who will perform their jobs without complaint."
LNS_root_out_traitors:0 "Reorganise Civilian Administration"
LNS_root_out_traitors_desc:0 "The obstructive bureaucrats have been a thorn in our side since the beginning! They need to be swiftly replaced with our own griffons, who shall follow our orders to the letter."
LNS_public_executions:0 "Public Executions"
LNS_public_executions_desc:0 "Clearly, the traitors haven't learned their lesson yet. A public display of what happens to those who oppose us will cow them. Let the corpses hang for a while, too, so that it is perfectly clear what it means to cross the Count."
LNS_work_them_to_the_bone:0 "Labour Camps"
LNS_work_them_to_the_bone_desc:0 "The ponies must be slaughtered, yes, but it would be more beneficial if we force them to work for us first. We shall set up camps in Varėna, have them work to the bone."
LNS_steal_their_property:0 "Confiscate Their Property"
LNS_steal_their_property_desc:0 "Living or dead, the ponies don't deserve to own a single coin, or plot of land. For the good of Longsword, anything that can further our goals will be seized."
LNS_plans_backfire:0 "The Plan Backfires"
LNS_plans_backfire_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, we've been hit with a setback after setback. Our allies in Hellquill are not satisfied with the current events, but the Count will offer solutions to our woes."
LNS_panic_in_the_countryside:0 "Partisan Uprising"
LNS_panic_in_the_countryside_desc:0 "Verdammt! Despite our extensive suppression, the pony scum have started a massive revolt in the countryside and have taken control! They must be dealt with, harshly."
LNS_mass_mutinies:0 "Mutinous Military"
LNS_mass_mutinies_desc:0 "Our own knightly order mutinies against us! They've grown soft, and refuse to participate in what they call a "genocide". Don't they understand we're saving Longsword?"
LNS_mass_uprising:0 "The Fire Rises"
LNS_mass_uprising_desc:0 "We are surrounded by traitors and rebels! It doesn't matter how many oppose us, we shall make Longsword a pure nation, or die trying!"

LNS_fascist_civil_war:0 "Purge the Unclean"
LNS_fascist_civil_war_desc:0 "So, the traitors have finally revealed themselves in the open? All the better! Now, we can slaughter them easily, all in one decisive assault. Vorwärts!"
LNS_emergency_conscription:0 "Call to Arms"
LNS_emergency_conscription_desc:0 "Every griffon who is currently working in a non-essential occupation will be drafted to our forces. The Reformisten will prevail!"
LNS_hasty_militias:0 "Reformisten Fanatics"
LNS_hasty_militias_desc:0 "Murderers, thugs, fanatics and zealots would normally not be considered for joining our regular forces, but times are hard and we need every willing griffon to beat back the ponies. Additionally, small numbers of volunteers have arrived from Hellquill to assist us."
LNS_child_soldiers:0 "Levy Everygriffon"
LNS_child_soldiers_desc:0 "It is regrettable that we must sacrifice our economy like this, but there can be no distinction between civilian and soldier when our existence is threatened. Rifles for everygriffon! Perhaps our enemies will hesitate to shoot "civilians"..."
LNS_grab_the_pistols:0 "Supplies from Hellquill"
LNS_grab_the_pistols_desc:0 "We shall call upon our allies from Hellquill to provide us with the much needed weaponry for our soldiers. Hopefully, they'll loan us a plenty."
LNS_grab_the_muskets:0 "Plead for More"
LNS_grab_the_muskets_desc:0 "It is not enough! The harsh reality of war demands seemingly endless amounts of firearms. Send another envoy to Hellquill, show them our desperate state!"
LNS_sharpen_spears:0 "Weapons of the Heroic Age"
LNS_sharpen_spears_desc:0 "Despite our best attempts to increase production and procure supplies from Hellquill, we still lack weapons for our troops. We have no other option but to use swords and spears used by our heroic ancestors in defence of Longsword. The troops better show a little respect for the relics."
LNS_houses_to_factories:0 "Houses to Factories"
LNS_houses_to_factories_desc:0 "Private property will be seized in order to convert them to impromptu factories, so we can produce necessary goods for our war effort."
LNS_we_need_more:0 "Seize Private Workshops"
LNS_we_need_more_desc:0 "Despite our efforts in maximising our production through longer work shifts and more workers, we still can't produce enough firearms for the troops. The solution lies in demanding production for the state from private manufactories, gunsmiths and workshops."
LNS_final_push:0 "For Glory!"
LNS_final_push_desc:0 "See how our enemy flees before us! Each Reformisten is worth at least three traitors! Victory lies just beyond our reach!"

LNS_commie_civil_war:0 "The Revolution!"
LNS_commie_civil_war_desc:0 "Follow me, Comrades! Let us drive out the hated tyrants from these lands and bring forth a socialist utopia!"
LNS_the_faith_of_the_people:0 "The Faith of the People"
LNS_the_faith_of_the_people_desc:0 "These are difficult times, but the common folk stands with us, as we are liberating the nation from murderers and thugs. Every little bit they can spare will greatly help."
LNS_peoples_militias:0 "Raise the Militias!"
LNS_peoples_militias_desc:0 "Ponies and sympathetic griffons are willingly flocking to our cause, we must give them a weapon and send them to front line! Only together can we remove the hated reactionaries!"
LNS_foreign_volunteers:0 "Foreign Support"
LNS_foreign_volunteers_desc:0 "Likeminded comrades from neighbouring countries have arrived, bringing weapons and soldiers for the fight. We are immensely grateful for their help."
LNS_cottage_industry:0 "Backyard Smelters"
LNS_cottage_industry_desc:0 "The people should not underestimate their own might. This is true for their industrial might as well! We do not need griffon factories, for we have everything we need to begin production in the homes and farmsteads, utilizing improvised equipment and scavenged materials."
LNS_underground_arms_factories:0 "Rifle Manufacturies"
LNS_underground_arms_factories_desc:0 "It is not enough to find old weapons from wherever we can, but also make new ones on our own. Our blacksmiths, metalworkers and carpenters shall now all become gunsmiths! The weapons they will make may not be of the highest quality, but they shall suffice."
LNS_wartime_propaganda:0 "Know Thy Enemy"
LNS_wartime_propaganda_desc:0 "Everypony who fights for our cause must know the full extent of Reformisten crimes! Educate the common folk, as well, to prevent any collaboration!"
LNS_smuggle_guns:0 ""Import" Rifles"
LNS_smuggle_guns_desc:0 "Friendly ponies from Lake City have secured us a weapons cache containing latest firearms. This will aid us considerably, and they've offered us a discount as well."
LNS_breakout_musuem_pieces:0 "Break Out the Old Guns"
LNS_breakout_musuem_pieces_desc:0 "Some of us find it distasteful, but we're forced to seize muskets from museums and private collections. As long as they can shoot, they can kill."
LNS_to_victory:0 "For Freedom!"
LNS_to_victory_desc:0 "Our victory is all but assured! The fascist thugs are at their last holdouts, we only need to strike them while they're down!"

LNS_neutral_civil_war:0 "Our Duty"
LNS_neutral_civil_war_desc:0 "Since ages past, our duty was to protect the griffon way of life from pony incursions. We were merely defending ourselves, but Dusktalon's horrifying plan will undoubtedly cause the entire River Coalition to attack us! He must be stopped!"
LNS_keep_calm:0 "Remain Steady"
LNS_keep_calm_desc:0 "Maintain your discipline, knights! Our cause is just and there is no need to panic. Remind the populace what we fight for."
LNS_keep_it_professional:0 "Conscript the Reservists"
LNS_keep_it_professional_desc:0 "It has come to this sooner than expected, but we're forced to send our reserve forces to the frontline in order to have a chance of victory."
LNS_and_man_the_cannons:0 "Artillery for the Cause"
LNS_and_man_the_cannons_desc:0 "We have seized a shipment of artillery headed for Swordsson! Quickly, give the troops rudimentary training and include them in our divisions!"
LNS_smalltime_industry:0 "Smalltime Industry"
LNS_smalltime_industry_desc:0 "We shall send a notice to the general population - every griffon or pony who is capable of producing any materiel for the war effort should volunteer to assist us. They'll be adequately compensated."
LNS_military_industry:0 "Economic Calibration"
LNS_military_industry_desc:0 "In times of war, some amenities have to be forfeited, and so we shall switch the production lines to make firearms for our soldiers. Once victory is assured, we can relieve the commonfolk of their burdens."
LNS_old_rifles:0 "Old Guns"
LNS_old_rifles_desc:0 "Our friends from the Imperial Heartlands have chipped in with a much welcome supply of weaponry. They might be slightly outdated, but they're much better than what most soldiers are wielding."
LNS_service_gurantees_citizenship:0 "Ponies in the Army"
LNS_service_gurantees_citizenship_desc:0 "The ponies have no love for the Reformisten, and we shall capitalise on this. Each pony who joins our forces will receive citizenship after the war is over, with all the benefits it entails."
LNS_desperate_measures:0 "Desperate Measures"
LNS_desperate_measures_desc:0 "Unfortunately, due to the chronic lack of strategic resources, we are unable to maintain a large production of latest firearms. We're forced to switch to older, but cheaper models."
LNS_semper_fi:0 "For Honour!"
LNS_semper_fi_desc:0 "Cast out the cruel tyrants from this land! Longsword will be liberated, and honour and tradition of the Rosewood Order will be restored!"

LNS_bandit_victory:0 "Heidenreich's Takeover"
LNS_bandit_victory_desc:0 ""Throw Dusktalon's body in the river, shoot anyone who objects, we're running this country my way now, and I've got some much better ideas than petty murdering...""
LNS_consolidate_power:0 "Consolidate Our Power"
LNS_consolidate_power_desc:0 "Even now, we've still got remnants from the civil war opposing us - Partisans, Reformisten, loyalist soldiers and more. Can't they see we've clearly won? We must teach the remainder a harsh lesson for opposing Rosa Heidenreich."
LNS_a_chance_meeting:0 "A Chance Meeting"
LNS_a_chance_meeting_desc:0 "Heidenreich is feeling rather discontent with life lately. Perhaps a good raid will drag her out of her misery."
LNS_a_lovely_gift:0 "A Lovely Gift"
LNS_a_lovely_gift_desc:0 "Heidenreich was so charmed by Eriviar's gift! She has requested that we send a gift in return, just as splendid! We might not have much, but surely there's benefits in having close relations with a foreign power."
LNS_some_wonderful_protection:0 "Some Wonderful Protection"
LNS_some_wonderful_protection_desc:0 "As a show of affection towards his beloved Rosa, Eriviar has sent some of his best bodyguards to our lands. Isn't he wonderful?"
LNS_a_return_gift:0 "A Token of Love"
LNS_a_return_gift_desc:0 "The budding relationship between Heidenreich and Eriviar has resulted in some benefits for us all, as the Sunstriker leader has sent us a caravan full of stolen goods, with slaves too!"
LNS_a_pleasant_evening:0 "A Pleasant Evening"
LNS_a_pleasant_evening_desc:0 "Heidenreich has been planning on inviting Eriviar for a visit for a long time, but the ongoing anarchy has made that difficult. Now that things are relatively stable, we shall prepare a festival for the visiting monarch! Among other things Heidenreich has in mind..."
LNS_maar_is_amused:0 "The Old One Laughs"
LNS_maar_is_amused_desc:0 "Maar is amused with the recent development of a relationship between Heidenreich and Eriviar, His acolytes say. He is offering us a boon, but it's a mystery what He can grant us..."
LNS_the_sunstriker_wedding:0 "The Wedding"
LNS_the_sunstriker_wedding_desc:0 ""You are cordially invited to attend the wedding between Eriviar Sunstriker and Rosa Heidenreich, to be joined together at the Brantbeak spires...""
LNS_defenceless_ponies:0 "Easy Prey In The Woods"
LNS_defenceless_ponies_desc:0 "The savage ponies of the north are even less civilized than we are, and we're bandits for Boreas' sake! They only remain free thanks to the protection of the River Coalition. But the eastern ponies are unlikely to intervene if we conduct some small-scale raids and take a little bit of land and loot."
LNS_beasts_of_burden:0 "Beasts Of Burden"
LNS_beasts_of_burden_desc:0 "Now that we've taken some land, we've come to the conclusion that it's damn worthless. But the ponies who live in the forest are quite valuable themselves. To compensate for the losses we took while seizing this land, we will put some of them to work to repay their debt to us."
LNS_mines_of_silverfalls:0 "The Treasures Of Silverfalls"
LNS_mines_of_silverfalls_desc:0 "Most thought that the name "Silverfalls" was just another gaudy and silly pony name, but turns out it is quite fitting. The local waterfalls are glimmering with flakes of silver! The ground must be full of precious ores, unexploited by the barbarians. Now we can exploit it on their behalf."
LNS_enslave_the_illiterate:0 ""Teach" the Illiterate"
LNS_enslave_the_illiterate_desc:0 "The fact is, solving the illiteracy issue in this nation will take too long and will cost too much. Therefore our boss has come up with the idea to simply enslave them all. Anybody who's weighing down our nation shall suffer a slow death in the mines. We can't say we disagree with this methodology."
LNS_massive_drug_fields:0 "The Opium Fields"
LNS_massive_drug_fields_desc:0 "Regular agriculture takes too long to return its investment. Instead, we'll set up plantations full of drugs! Hedonistic griffons in the Heartlands and beyond pay a pretty coin for them, and we can't let this opportunity slip by our claws."
LNS_imperial_markets:0 "Expanding Our Horizons"
LNS_imperial_markets_desc:0 "Our success in the criminal enterprise has attracted the attention of the organised crime syndicates in the Heartlands. They wish to work with us, so we can become even richer together! We'd be fools to pass this chance up, our coffers could always use more loot."
LNS_despoil_the_land:0 "Despoil the Land"
LNS_despoil_the_land_desc:0 "The common folk will receive a very simple choice - give over anything that has a modicum of value or get shot. Naturally, we'll take their valuables if they resist, but hey, we gave them a fair chance."
LNS_lesson_of_the_reformisten:0 "Lessons of the Reformisten"
LNS_lesson_of_the_reformisten_desc:0 "Certainly, the Reformisten ideology was nebulous and full of holes, but they had some great ideas too. Namely, putting our enemies into forced servitude - we got the guns, and they'll obey our orders, or else..."
LNS_into_the_mines:0 "Into the Mines"
LNS_into_the_mines_desc:0 "It's not enough to just force griffons to serve in our private armies, but we need to have them work in our mines, too. That iron won't dig up by itself, and Boreas knows we need a lot of it for our rifles..."
LNS_an_iron_grip:0 "A Firm Claw"
LNS_an_iron_grip_desc:0 "Our creative methods to solving Longsword's issues are shaping up to be a success. The rebellious nature of the common folk has been finally quashed down for good, and now we rule this land uncontested. This means we're free to expand our operations as Heidenreich sees fit."
LNS_target_practice:0 "A Shooting Competition"
LNS_target_practice_desc:0 "With all the turmoil going on these days, we've found ourselves lacking in things like proper military training and commanders. But we've got a solution for that as well! Hold a shooting contest and conscript the most skilled ones for our warbands. We will provide moving targets."
LNS_organ_donors:0 "Slave Trafficking"
LNS_organ_donors_desc:0 "They say life is the most precious commodity, and this is especially true on the slave market. Slavery might be illegal in most of Griffonia, but that doesn't mean there is no underground market for forced labour. Through our contacts, we may also reach the lucrative slave markets of Zebrica."
LNS_reinvest_our_profits:0 "Reinvest Our Profits"
LNS_reinvest_our_profits_desc:0 "It doesn't take an economic genius to figure out that if we were to invest some of our stolen plunder, we can improve our situation at home drastically, and allow us to perform even better in the future."
LNS_we_are_rich:0 "We Are Rich!"
LNS_we_are_rich_desc:0 "Some of us had doubts, but Rosa's reign has been nothing but an astounding success. If we knew it would be this easy to become rich, we would have gotten rid of the Count years ago! Our wealth now allows us to increase our nation's standing even more, improving our living standards... If you're one of the bandits, that is. The rest should just be grateful we didn't shoot them. Praise Rosa Heidenreich!"
LNS_legalize_poverty:0 "Deal With the Impoverished"
LNS_legalize_poverty_desc:0 "The poverty in this nation wouldn't be so bad if these lazy griffons got off their rears and started working for a change. Which is exactly what we're going to do - open new factories and politely "suggest" these leeches of society work for whatever we pay them, or else."
LNS_work_programs:0 "Work Programs for the Poor"
LNS_work_programs_desc:0 "Would you look at that, our solution for the chronic poverty is working! Despite the abject working conditions and measly pay check, griffons are lining up to work at whatever we throw at them. Expand our work programs, there's a lot more that needs to be done."
LNS_black_market_arms_industry:0 "Our Spot in the Arms Market"
LNS_black_market_arms_industry_desc:0 "In these current times, you can't toss a rock without finding at least three warmongering nations on Griffonia. And what's more profitable than selling arms? We must seize a piece of this market to increase our profit margins."
LNS_southern_sister:0 "The Southern Sister"
LNS_southern_sister_desc:0 "In the mountains of Blackhollow, a former republican turned warlord has embraced a life of banditry and has built a formidable crime empire. She is known as Blackrock, and has many things in common with Rosa. Perhaps we should conduct an expedition down south and make contact with our fellow bandits?"
LNS_ally_blackrock:0 "Friendship Is Banditry"
LNS_ally_blackrock_desc:0 "Blackrock and Rosa got along quickly, sharing so much in common. Both are disillusioned by the ideologies of misguided griffons. In truth, they don't need any such nonsense. All they need is each other, and together they will fight against the world if they have to."
LNS_split_lushi:0 "Take Lushian Assets"
LNS_split_lushi_desc:0 "The fat nobles down in Lushi are known to be filthy rich. We should deprive them of their wealth! Given their political bickering, we'll be plundering the vaults of Lumium in a week. Hopefully Blackrock will be available to join in on the fun."
LNS_friendship_is_banditry:0 "Safe and Secure"
LNS_friendship_is_banditry_desc:0 "Unsurprisingly, there are many who'd want to wipe us off the map. We should look into fortifying our holdings to ensure that anyone invading us has a hard time. We may be bandits, but we're still hardened soldiers and we won't give up so easily."
LNS_girls_night_out:0 "Alcohol Smuggling"
LNS_girls_night_out_desc:0 "With the ongoing political situation across the entirety of Griffonia, it's no surprise griffons and ponies turn to the bottle for comfort. By opening new liquor factories, we'd make a killing selling it! Unfortunately, alcohol trade regulations are strict and thus we must resort to smuggling it. It would be prudent to secure the safety of our runners."
LNS_smuggling:0 "The Cigar Trade"
LNS_smuggling_desc:0 "Following the success of our liquor scheme, we've decided to expand our capacities to produce cigars as well. They might take a few years of your life, but at least you'll die happy. But again, we must expand additional resources into ensuring our illegal drug trade isn't intercepted by the authorities..."
LNS_besties:0 "The Count's Treasure"
LNS_besties_desc:0 "The late Count was, among his other "qualities", quite fond of hoarding stolen wealth from the murdered ponies. He also had a habit of hiding it in remote locations, but Heidenreich has discovered a map of these caches in the Count's study. This plunder will provide us with a great boost towards our goals."
LNS_naniwich_mountain_trip:0 "Poaching"
LNS_naniwich_mountain_trip_desc:0 "The wildlife in these areas is remarkably diverse. But more importantly, all sorts of useful materials can be obtained from hunting animals, such as furs, leathers and much more. These things would be very useful for our soldiers, not to mention the potential sales value. It's not like we care about endangered species, either. More hunting rifles are needed at once!"
LNS_arms_trade:0 "The Arms Trade"
LNS_arms_trade_desc:0 "There is honour among thieves, certainly, and this has resulted in us making a deal with the other, similarly structured states across Griffonia. By exchanging whatever modern firearm models we come across, we can ensure we're a step ahead of our victims, and continue lining our pockets with plunder. Of course, we'll require some additional factories to produce these new weapons."
LNS_longswordian_dream:0 "The Longswordian Dream"
LNS_longswordian_dream_desc:0 "Our land is a free one, with no laws to bind anyone. Any capable griffon can make a living by exploiting those below him and by participating in the numerous criminal activities taking place in Longsword. Many criminals and bandits persecuted elsewhere now come to us, to our haven of scum and villainy."

LNS_bandit_army:0 "An Army of Bandits"
LNS_bandit_army_desc:0 ""Listen up, you thugs. If we're going to be rich, you're going to follow my way - disobey me and your body will be in the river by the next hour. Now get your rears to the training grounds.""
LNS_get_guns:0 "Arm the Bands"
LNS_get_guns_desc:0 ""If you don't own a rifle, you're worthless to me. Find a gun, I don't care how you do it, and then get back to me. How do you plan on stealing anything if you don't have a way of protecting yourself?""
LNS_basic_artillery:0 "Bandits With Cannons"
LNS_basic_artillery_desc:0 "It's hard to make a living when our victims hide behind forts and walls. Some improved artillery models should enable us to get back on track. Enemies will cower once they hear the sound of our cannons!"
LNS_pull_out_shovels:0 "Paymasters"
LNS_pull_out_shovels_desc:0 "Scouts, engineers, repairgriffs - we've got them all, but they insist on a special deal if they were to serve us. In exchange for personally paying their subordinates, they want full control of their companies and a cut of the loot. As this suits our overall military strategy, we've agreed to their terms. Support companies are invaluable on the field, after all."
LNS_organize_warbands:0 "Organise the Warbands"
LNS_organize_warbands_desc:0 "We've got a lot of griffons eager to join us, but they see themselves as one griff armies, believing they're invincible just because they have a gun. Some proper organisation will go a long way in making sure we get the most plunder out of each raid, with nobody squabbling over their share."
LNS_appoint_leaders:0 "New Talent"
LNS_appoint_leaders_desc:0 "After the anarchy, we've been left with barely any capable commanders for leading our forces. However, some of the raid leaders have proven themselves skilled, and it would be a shame to have their talent go to waste. Heidenreich will personally promote this new blood."
LNS_personal_armies:0 "Personal Armies"
LNS_personal_armies_desc:0 "With lawlessness and anarchy being the usual state of affairs in Longsword these days, it's no surprise the population has resorted to hiring personal militias and protection squadrons, to protect what little they have. We can use this to our advantage as well, to complement our forces."
LNS_new_tactics:0 "New Formations"
LNS_new_tactics_desc:0 "Our foes fight in disciplined formations and use modern warfare doctrines, so why shouldn't we? We can't expect the prey to just give up their livelihoods, so instead we'll have to work on our tactics, to ensure the best chance of success in the field."
LNS_hit_and_run:0 "Hit and Run Tactics"
LNS_hit_and_run_desc:0 "Most of our griffons are simply not disciplined enough to maintain their battle positions. Incompetence or cowardice, it matters not, for we'll train our armies to continuously harass our victims before retreating, wearing them down. This cycle of pain will continue until they all die, or surrender."
LNS_tank_raiding_brigade:0 "Bandits With Tanks"
LNS_tank_raiding_brigade_desc:0 "Trucks and other similar vehicles make a great getaway option for our warbands, but they're vulnerable against small arms fire. However, if we were to adopt what they call "tank" in the Heartlands, we'd have our protection and a new way to spread terror on our raids."
LNS_baggage:0 "Baggage Slaves"
LNS_baggage_desc:0 "Organising a proper logistical team isn't an option, between all our autonomous, single objective focused armies. Who'd be able to properly supply them, when they're scattered across all directions? Instead, we'll allow the commanders to assign some of the slaves as pack mules, ensuring they are supplied well wherever they go."
LNS_the_apocalypse:0 "Despoiler Brigades"
LNS_the_apocalypse_desc:0 "Now that we've applied the lessons of modern warfare to our raids, it is time to create special divisions, who will be trained specifically in inflicting as much devastation as they can on our prey. Who said banditry didn't pay off? These griffons will steal anything that isn't bolted to the ground."

LNS_bandit_airforce:0 "Bandits In Planes"
LNS_bandit_airforce_desc:0 "The predator lies high on the food chain, and who's more dangerous than us? If we were to invest in creating and maintaining an air force, it would ensure our dominance over our victims... Not to mention raiding would go much quicker from these flying machines."
LNS_fighters:0 "A Pair of Claws"
LNS_fighters_desc:0 "Quick, agile, capable of taking on any plane - the bandits love these fighter planes. Our self-funded pilots have been pressing us to adopt newest fighter designs across the entire nation, so we can have control of the skies at all times."
LNS_heavier_fighters:0 "Talons of Steel"
LNS_heavier_fighters_desc:0 "Despite their agility, regular fighters are somewhat frail and require a lot of skill to properly pilot. A heavier fighter model will be the solution to our problems in maintaining air superiority, and they'll be able to better protect our other planes, as well."
LNS_airfields:0 "The Zeltstadt Airfields"
LNS_airfields_desc:0 "Those flygriffs have been begging us to build airfields for months. We've decided to grant their request, if only because we've realised the importance of planes in today's warfare. Not to mention that our raider groups would have more reliable support."
LNS_our_own_doctrine:0 "Altitude Training"
LNS_our_own_doctrine_desc:0 "We've got many volunteers for our air forces, but very few possess the optimal training to handle flying. Our few experienced pilots will be assigned to train as many as they can, developing the beginning of our air doctrine at the same time."
LNS_close_air_support:0 "Up Close and Personal"
LNS_close_air_support_desc:0 "Machine guns and bombs are the ideal instruments of killing, but they're hard to get in proper range on the battlefield. Instead, we'll adapt a fighter model to be more efficient in providing ground support for our forces."
LNS_further_developments:0 "Flight Training Programs"
LNS_further_developments_desc:0 "The initial efforts have paid off, with more and more griffons flocking to become a pilot. The initial wave of recruits have shown promise in handling airplanes, as well, which marks the formation of a professional airforce. Soon enough, our victims won't know what hit 'em!"
LNS_bombers:0 "Explosive Eggs"
LNS_bombers_desc:0 "Explosions! Who doesn't love explosions? Our prey certainly won't once we unveil our new bomber planes, designed to inflict maximum damage on their lands and units..."
LNS_strategic_bombers:0 "Steel Shells"
LNS_strategic_bombers_desc:0 "Conventional bombing does the job well against regular forces, but they don't have the reach or protection to properly assault enemy cities and fortifications. We'll build the biggest, hardest hitting, highest flying bomber yet! Our victims will know their livelihoods are forfeit once these start bombing..."
LNS_ace_fighters:0 "The Black Dozens"
LNS_ace_fighters_desc:0 "Surprisingly, our intense training program has resulted in a formation of a dedicated, passionate group of pilots. Trained in unconventional tactics, they'll be our claws in the sky, striking down any enemy plane, at day or night... Sharing their valuable experience with the other, less trained pilots, as well."
LNS_napalm:0 "Firebombing"
LNS_napalm_desc:0 "Napalm has been denounced as a savage weapon by the civilised western nations, but we hold no such compulsions. If it helps us secure our loot, we'll do it - perhaps our targets will stop resisting so fiercely once they see their precious cities and fields burning..."
LNS_jet_experiments:0 "Bandits With Rockets"
LNS_jet_experiments_desc:0 "Would you look at that? These new rockets leave the current planes in the dust. We should expand our investment in these rockets, they'll give us the fastest and most dangerous weapons in the sky."

LNS_military_victory:0 "Restoration of Order"
LNS_military_victory_desc:0 "Dusktalon may have been deposed, but the country is still wracked and ruined by the years of devastation the Reformisten inflicted on it in their savage goal. We must quickly reassure our people that they have nothing to fear anymore."
LNS_cement_our_rule:0 "Establishing Our Government"
LNS_cement_our_rule_desc:0 "The first order of business is to set up a working, functional government. What existed before was little before than Dusktalon's cronyism on a massive scale, and it showed by their chronic incompetence."
LNS_educate_the_people_military:0 "Education for the Masses"
LNS_educate_the_people_military_desc:0 "Education has been a scarce luxury for a long time in Longsword, mainly because of the Refomisten's seizure of all education material they deemed "corrupted by ponies", which is to say, almost all of it. Schools and libraries will be reopened, and the population will be encouraged to educate themselves."
LNS_address_the_poverty:0 "Help the Impoverished"
LNS_address_the_poverty_desc:0 "For years, the high taxes forced upon by the Reformisten have left the common folk with little more than the clothes on their backs. If we are to have a proper, working nation, the chronic poverty must be addressed through welfare and public works programs."
LNS_status_of_the_ponies_politically:0 "The Rights of Ponies"
LNS_status_of_the_ponies_politically_desc:0 "Ponies shall not be discriminated against and hated anymore! Our laws will be immediately updated to reflect the forming of a new, tolerant society, in which both ponies and griffons can have the same rights and privileges."
LNS_status_of_ponies_as_advisors:0 "Invite Ponies to the Government"
LNS_status_of_ponies_as_advisors_desc:0 "There are many capable, skilled ponies in our country, and it would be a loss for us if we were to disregard their capabilities. To improve the functioning of our nation, and to heal the wounds from the recent blood shedding, the best and brightest will be invited to work for our government."
LNS_land_distribution_to_veterans:0 "Reward the Veterans"
LNS_land_distribution_to_veterans_desc:0 "Those who have risked their lives and more for Longsword shall be properly rewarded, with a sufficient amount of land to sustain themselves. Hopefully, this will also entice more citizens to join our forces, knowing that they will be rewarded at the end of their service."
LNS_connect_the_nation:0 "The Longsword Highway"
LNS_connect_the_nation_desc:0 "The infrastructure has been in a sad state for a long time, between Reformisten negligence and Partisan sabotage. This changes now, and all of Longsword will be properly connected once more."
LNS_industrial_effort:0 "Begin Industrialisation"
LNS_industrial_effort_desc:0 "While the military is a highly important part of our society, of course, we cannot live on bayonets and rifles alone. We shall begin industrialising our country, in order to enable a steady source of employment for our civilians."
LNS_further_industrialisation:0 "More Factories!"
LNS_further_industrialisation_desc:0 "The initial industrial expansion has been a success, and we shall follow up on it by opening more factories and workplaces. The rolling stone of industrialisation shall sweep across the land and bring forth a new age of advancement."
LNS_teach_the_people:0 "New Education Standards"
LNS_teach_the_people_desc:0 "The common folk can only educate themselves up to a certain level. In order to bring our nation to a more contemporary state, we must expand our education centres, open new scientific institutes and invite foreign educators from the Heartlands."
LNS_military_education:0 "Mandatory Basic Training"
LNS_military_education_desc:0 "The world is a dangerous place, and we won't survive for long if we don't institute a mandatory training program for all able-bodied citizens. That way, once the next war inevitably starts, we'll have a large pool of griffons and ponies already fit for recruitment."
LNS_a_gun_in_every_home:0 "Weapons for Everyone"
LNS_a_gun_in_every_home_desc:0 "Freedom cannot be guaranteed without a means to defend it, and the best way to do that is by loosening firearm ownership regulations and providing extra subsidies to weapon manufacturers. An armed society is a safe society."
LNS_recruitment_drive:0 "Recruitment Campaign"
LNS_recruitment_drive_desc:0 "With extensive propaganda efforts, we can show the civilians the glory and honour of serving in our military! Of course, to ensure that they stay in our forces, additional benefits and privileges will be given to soldiers and auxiliary forces."
LNS_lessons_of_the_partisans:0 "Incorporate Partisan Tactics"
LNS_lessons_of_the_partisans_desc:0 "Some of the surviving Partisans have expressed interest in serving in our forces. Better yet, they've offered to share their tactics and finesse! Our soldiers will be become even more skilled in every aspect of warfare."
LNS_state_armouries:0 "Firearm Production Expansion"
LNS_state_armouries_desc:0 "All these new recruits will require a lot more equipment than we can currently produce. To solve this, additional factories focused on firearm production will be built, and already existing ones will have their machines upgraded to increase production."
LNS_military_police_f:0 "Militärpolizei"
LNS_military_police_f_desc:0 "To ensure our troops are loyal to the cause, we shall establish a paramilitary force in charge of maintaining discipline, rooting out any traitors or saboteurs, and to spread our carefully woven propaganda. This will ensure our military is one step ahead compared to our foes."
LNS_old_friends:0 "Our Friends in the Empire"
LNS_old_friends_desc:0 "Now that we've restored the proper Longswordian nation, an envoy will be sent to Griffenheim to re-establish our relations with the Empire. They will be happy knowing they can sleep in peace, with the stalwart defenders of the eastern borders preventing any incursions."
LNS_pensions:0 "Military Pensions"
LNS_pensions_desc:0 "Most of our veterans have a difficult time returning to a civilian society, even with their land grants. Many have gone bankrupt or unable to properly feed themselves, and this cannot be allowed. A basic income for our retired troops will be instituted, to properly show our gratitude for their years of service."
LNS_dealing_with_hellquill_military:0 "The Problem of Hellquill"
LNS_dealing_with_hellquill_military_desc:0 "Our northern neighbours in Hellquill have been our staunch allies for a long time, but recent events have mired this longstanding relationship. We must investigate the events and political situation in their lands, and react appropriately."
LNS_bauxite_deposits:0 "Bauxite Mines"
LNS_bauxite_deposits_desc:0 "Large amounts of bauxite have been uncovered while digging for iron in the mines near Zeltstadt. To an average griffon, this sedimentary rock might seem worthless, but from it we can extract precious aluminium, a key component in production of modern airplanes."
LNS_a_proper_nation:0 "A Modern Society"
LNS_a_proper_nation_desc:0 "At last, we have brought Longsword to a modern age. No longer shall the commonfolk remain ignorant and unaware of the world beyond their homes, nor shall we be left behind in the research of newest technologies."
LNS_imperial_volunteers:0 "Imperial Aid"
LNS_imperial_volunteers_desc:0 "Our diplomatic efforts have paid off, and volunteers from the Heartlands have arrived to assist us in holding the border. This is a tremendous help to our efforts."
LNS_shield_of_griffonia:0 "Protectors of Griffonia"
LNS_shield_of_griffonia_desc:0 "With the lands of Hellquill now united with ours, together we shall stand united against any incursions from the eastern ponies. There can be no telling when a radical leader takes over in the Riverlands and decides to wage war on honest living griffons... To this we say, let them come! We shall be prepared for anything, and we shall never falter in our duty!"

LNS_army_creation_neutral:0 "Rebuilding Our Army"
LNS_army_creation_neutral_desc:0 "Dusktalon and his thugs have neglected the proper Longswordian army for too long. No more! We shall rebuild our forces to a more contemporary time while remaining true to the ideals of our honourable ancestors."
LNS_pure_army:0 "Griffons Only!"
LNS_pure_army_desc:0 "The ponies cannot be entirely trusted to serve in our forces. While we have saved them from the clutches of the Reformisten, who's to say they won't turn on us, once their gratitude for us evaporates? No, only griffons will be allowed to serve in the armed forces. They're stronger, they can fly, and don't require specially crafted firearms."
LNS_mixed_army:0 "Allow Recruitment of Ponies"
LNS_mixed_army_desc:0 "We cannot be selective with our recruitment criteria, given our country's small size. Provided they don't cause any trouble, ponies will be allowed to serve side by side with griffons in the defence of Longsword."
LNS_superior_army_1:0 "Feuer und Schwefel"
LNS_superior_army_1_desc:0 "Only through overwhelming firepower can we secure victory. Massing our artillery, improving our firearms, coordination with the air forces - anything and everything to ensure a maximum output of devastation onto the enemy. They won't be able to withstand our barrage."
LNS_mass_army_1:0 "Eine Welle von Körpern"
LNS_mass_army_1_desc:0 "With our current situation, we cannot hope to field armies larger than our current threats. We shall compensate by doubling down on recruitment and mass assault tactics, in order to achieve an approximate parity in military strength."
LNS_mobile_army_1:0 "Gepanzerte Kriegsführung"
LNS_mobile_army_1_desc:0 "Our more traditionalist commanders scoff at the idea, but the reality is that a highly mobile army is the future of warfare. By overrunning our enemies before they can properly react, a swift and decisive victory will be ensured."
LNS_military_industrial_complex:0 "Military-Industrial Complex"
LNS_military_industrial_complex_desc:0 "In order to supply our forces with everything they might need, our defence industries and the military will be closely cooperating in opening new facilities and production lines."
LNS_rifle_modernisation:0 "New Guns"
LNS_rifle_modernisation_desc:0 "Our current firearm models are obsolete and prone to frequent breakdowns. This is unacceptable for a militarised society like ours, and to solve this, we shall procure newest models from the Heartlands and beyond."
LNS_proper_trucks:0 "Improved Motorised Models"
LNS_proper_trucks_desc:0 "While the current motorised models are suitable for transporting troops quickly, they cannot quite hold up in a proper fight. Turning them into a light tank variant will ensure our troops can be protected, while maintaining their mobility."
LNS_radio_utilisation:0 "Military Applications of the Radio"
LNS_radio_utilisation_desc:0 "The wonderful invention called the radio has solved many issues we've been facing for ages, but now they must adapted for our usage in armed forces. With it, we can coordinate our assaults and issue requisition orders as soon as needed."
LNS_artillery_military:0 "The Cannons of the Future"
LNS_artillery_military_desc:0 "Our current artillery models are falling apart and cannot keep up with their objectives anymore. New designs will be required that make use of longer barrels, hydraulic recoil devices and lighter but more destructive shells."
LNS_engineer_f:0 "Dedicated Engineer Companies"
LNS_engineer_f_desc:0 "Digging ditches and building makeshift bridges isn't glamourous work, but it is crucial in assisting our forces. Dedicated support squads will be established."
LNS_recon_f:0 "Scouting Ahead"
LNS_recon_f_desc:0 "There's more to war than just fighting your enemy, for we must always know what lies ahead of us. A prepared army is a victorious army."
LNS_light_tanks_military:0 "Initial Armoured Attempt"
LNS_light_tanks_military_desc:0 "It might have seemed like a foolish idea, but placing as armour on a truck and having it be able to withstand small arms assault has shown that there is promise in these tanks. We shall expand on this development, and build proper models soon enough!"
LNS_medium_tanks_military:0 "A Proper Tank"
LNS_medium_tanks_military_desc:0 "Now that our initial efforts have born results, we are free to design a proper battle tank instead of just repurposing a truck or a tractor. They will be the mainstay of our motorised forces."
LNS_magical_rifles:0 "Innovative Uses of Magic"
LNS_magical_rifles_desc:0 "Magic has been a mainstay of our ordinary lives since as long as we can remember, but only recently we've discovered a way to store spells inside magical crystals. With some ingenuity, we can store these crystals in a prototype rifle, and create a much better weapon than current conventional models."
LNS_spec_ops:0 "Dedicated Special Operation Teams"
LNS_spec_ops_desc:0 "In ages past, each knight was an army in itself, being highly independent. Nowadays we can't let individual specially trained troops wander on their own objectives, but instead we shall form entire divisions of these hardy griffons."
LNS_rather_heavy_tanks:0 "Bulldoze Our Enemies"
LNS_rather_heavy_tanks_desc:0 "With our success in designing tanks, we can now apply this knowledge in building the largest and most armoured tanks. No defensive line will be able to withstand their assault."
LNS_rocket_artillery:0 "More Explosions!"
LNS_rocket_artillery_desc:0 "While rocket based artillery is more inaccurate compared to regular towed pieces, they make it up in inflicted devastation. We shall begin including them in our mainstay forces, once the initial designs pass the testing stages."
LNS_special_forces_initiative:0 "Glorify the Elites"
LNS_special_forces_initiative_desc:0 "Our elites are truly the pride of our military! Highly trained and professional, every aspiring regular soldier and civilian wants to be a part of our elite corps. Let us ensure that by expanding our training programs and raising our limits."
LNS_blitzkrieg:0 "Thunderous Warfare"
LNS_blitzkrieg_desc:0 "Our recent innovations in mobile warfare have been a great success, and now we can apply them to all of our forces. They will be able to keep up with our coordinated assault from both air and land."
LNS_Zeltstadt_institute:0 "Zeltstadt Military Institute"
LNS_Zeltstadt_institute_desc:0 "We've learned much about the modern art of warfare, but that doesn't mean every officer and commander in the army knows about them. A military academy to teach our commissioned troops will be established, so they can be at the forefront of tactical leadership."

LNS_navy_and_airforce_military:0 "The War at Sea and Air"
LNS_navy_and_airforce_military_desc:0 "The rapidly changing aspect of modern warfare requires us to think in more dimensions than just pure land forces. Control of the seas and skies are crucial, as well."
LNS_air_doctrine_military:0 "Choosing Our Airforce Strategy"
LNS_air_doctrine_military_desc:0 "Our growing air force requires a dedicated doctrine to operate more efficiently. After consulting our production capabilities and available plane models, we shall make the decision for our best choice."
LNS_navy_doctrine_military:0 "Naval Doctrine"
LNS_navy_doctrine_military_desc:0 "Ships require a certain strategy to operate to their fullest, and to achieve that, we must look into existing naval doctrines and adapting the ones that suit our needs the most."
LNS_proper_airbases_military:0 "Hangars for the Planes"
LNS_proper_airbases_military_desc:0 "Enemies can strike with their planes from any direction, and relying on a single base for our planes is risky. Building additional ones will expand our coverage, and ensure our own planes can have multiple bases to refuel from, in case the others are disabled."
LNS_radar_project_military:0 "Improving Our Radar"
LNS_radar_project_military_desc:0 "With the increased reliance on radio communication, a system will be designed to intercept and locate these signals. Radar, as it is called, will ensure we won't be blind from sudden attacks from land, sea or sky."
LNS_home_port_military:0 "Our Home Port"
LNS_home_port_military_desc:0 "A central location from which we shall base our ships and ports must be chosen, in order to smoothen the establishing of our naval forces."
LNS_tac_bomber_focus_military:0 "Tactical Bomber Designs"
LNS_tac_bomber_focus_military_desc:0 "The increasing reliance on fortifications makes it hard for our troops to properly assault enemy positions. Artillery being less effective against these concrete bunkers, we shall instead focus on building bomber airplane models to hit them harder than before."
LNS_strat_bomber_focus_military:0 "Strategic Bomber Developments"
LNS_strat_bomber_focus_military_desc:0 "Many years of fighting has shown that a war can't be won by just killing our enemies, but only by destroying their industry and military bases. Reducing their capabilities to produce firearms will ensure a collapse of their frontlines, and to do that, we shall design our largest bomber model yet."
LNS_fighters_focus_military:0 "Controlling the Skies"
LNS_fighters_focus_military_desc:0 "Each plane in the sky assures our ground forces will have a smoother time. We must look into improving our fighter models, if we want to maintain our superiority."
LNS_close_support_focus_military:0 "Support for the Ground Forces"
LNS_close_support_focus_military_desc:0 "Bombers are expensive to build and maintain, which is why a dedicated fighter model will be made, carrying a similar payload to assist our ground forces in destroying our foes."
LNS_heavy_fighters_focus_military:0 "Heavy Fighter Initiative"
LNS_heavy_fighters_focus_military_desc:0 "While regular fighters are appropriate for contesting the skies, they do not have the range to keep up with our bombers. Larger, more heavily armed and armoured fighters will be made to give our bombers much needed protection."
LNS_plane_factory_military:0 "Kupiškis Institute of Aviation"
LNS_plane_factory_military_desc:0 "The war of air is the war of tomorrow. We cannot afford to ignore this new field of warfare nor can we afford aircraft at all! Having production centres specialised in aircraft fabrication will help lower the cost of these new death machines."
LNS_rocketry_focus_military:0 "Faster than Sound"
LNS_rocketry_focus_military_desc:0 "Our prototype rockets have shown great promise with their speed and ability to carry a destructive payload. Expanding on this, we can produce reliable models that can strike our enemies from vast ranges, with no danger to the lives of our soldiers."
LNS_naval_aviation_military:0 "Bombing their Ships"
LNS_naval_aviation_military_desc:0 "The current ship designs are quite vulnerable towards attacks based from the sky. Our current bomber models do not have the reach for this task, but a specially designed bomber could specialise in this task and secure our control of the seas."
### A big thanks to Captain for writing some of the following naval focuses, go pat him
LNS_destroyer_focus_military:0 "Building Our Destroyers"
LNS_destroyer_focus_military_desc:0 "Now that we have secured a suitable base of operations, the time has come to take the next step in our efforts to provide a naval shield for the Empire. In order to secure the shipping lanes and hunt potential threat from beneath the waves, we can now focus our efforts on creating more advanced destroyer designs."
LNS_submarine_focus_military:0 "A Subtle Deterrent"
LNS_submarine_focus_military_desc:0 "Submarines might be a dishonourable weapon, but they are excellent at destroying enemy convoys and lone ships, strangling their control of the seas. We must expand our submarine flotilla to ensure our foes cannot wander the seas uncontested."
LNS_cruiser_focus_military:0 "Screens for the Navy"
LNS_cruiser_focus_military_desc:0 "Our continuing efforts to secure the waves for the Empire require us to design larger and more powerful vessels, capable of fending off the assaults of destroyers and other small ships, while remaining fast and maneuverable. These cruiser designs will significantly increase our naval presence."
LNS_battlecruiser_focus_military:0 "A Proper Ship"
LNS_battlecruiser_focus_military_desc:0 "The growth of our naval forces has reached the point where we now feel ready to begin work on capital warships. Fast and well-armed, battlecruisers will allow us to project true power far from land, and mark our transition from a purely defensive stance to having the ability to strike back at menacing foes."
LNS_battleship_focus_military:0 "Floating Fortresses"
LNS_battleship_focus_military_desc:0 "To truly express the grandeur and glory of the Empire on the waves, only one type of warship will suffice: we need battleships. Heavily armed and powerfully protected, these ship will bring us, and the Empire, glory, and strike fear into the hearts of any that dare to challenge our naval mastery."
LNS_expanded_docks_military:0 "Continue Dockyard Expansion"
LNS_expanded_docks_military_desc:0 "Our growing navy requires more production facilities than we currently have. If we want to drastically cut down the construction times for our ships, we must look into expanding our dockyards and ports."
LNS_carriers_focus_military:0 "Union of Sea and Sky"
LNS_carriers_focus_military_desc:0 "Victory on the seas is not determined anymore by who has the most ships, but who can control the skies as well. With convoys adapted to carry fighters and bombers, we shall be able to solidify our grasp on the seas once and for all."
LNS_nuclear_focus:0 "The Ultimate Solution"
LNS_nuclear_focus_desc:0 "The atoms hold many secrets to the creation of our world, but more importantly, we can use the knowledge of their interactions to construct facilities to produce staggering amounts of energy and weapons that will instil fear in our foes..."

LSC_fate_of_rosewood:0 "Fate of the Rosewood Order"
LSC_fate_of_rosewood_desc:0 "The Rosewood Order formed the core of the griffon resistance against Count Pallas and the Reformisten. While we may have ended up at war with one another, tensions between us are not high, and the possibility arises to rehabilitate some of these honorable griffons."

LSC_agrarian_revolution:0 "The Agrarian Revolution"
LSC_agrarian_revolution_desc:0 "Our revolution is not one of the workers, it's not one of the artisans, it's not even one of the soldiers, it's one of the farmers and peasants. Some might claim such a revolution will never lead to a socialist system for we lack education and will. But let them be damned, we are not trying to prove something to them, we are liberating our citizens."
LSC_popular_education:0 "Popular Education Programs"
LSC_popular_education_desc:0 "Count Pallas and his lackeys have left Longsword brutalized economically and socially, leaving the populace illiterate and it's scientific ability lacking. Now that we have crushed his tyranny and resolved internal issues, we must strive to eliminate this issue. After all, if our citizens are illiterate, how can they read socialist theory, not to mention learn about the great history of Longsword?"
LSC_unknown_hero_monument:0 "Monument to the Unknown Revolutionary"
LSC_unknown_hero_monument_desc:0 "Our history is very important of course, but even if we are proud of our ancient kings and heroes, they shouldn't be the only inspiration for memorials and art, not in a socialist system. Thus a new archetype will be created for which monuments will be built and about which art will be created - the unknown revolutionary, a symbol of the lower classes and the greatness they can achieve."
LSC_internationalism:0 "Internationalism"
LSC_internationalism_desc:0 "While we do not support the ideas of pan-continental or even pan-planetary socialist states, we do support the idea of spreading the socialist revolution. After all we need to repay all the brave souls that fought for our own liberation despite not being Longswordians themselves. Not to mention that hopefully a socialist world will be one safer for our existence."
LSC_foreign_volunteers:0 "Invite Foreign Sympathizers"
LSC_foreign_volunteers_desc:0 "It seems that our new internationalist stance is viewed far more positively than we expected, not just among our populace, but even abroad. Many a creature, both longswordian native and foreigner are now volunteering and in some cases even demanding to be allowed to join our military and help in the great struggle. And we will allow it."
LSC_voluntary_collectivization:0 "Voluntary Collectivization"
LSC_voluntary_collectivization_desc:0 "While our ideal society would be based on collectives, this isn't something that should be achieved through force, especially not when that would mean betraying many a pony and griffon which helped in our revolution despite being bourgeois. No, the collectivization of Longsword will be a voluntary, if encouraged one, to create not only a socialist system, but a benevolent and generous society."
LSC_ancestor_worship:0 "Honor our Ancestors"
LSC_ancestor_worship_desc:0 "The Vartai is a realm of faith and the faithful. Our history has been defined by wars of faith and great ponies and griffons inspired by the divine. Even in modern day this continues, as many of the most prominent partisans are leaders are creatures of faith. And it will continue into the future, as while Longsword is socialist, it will also be governed by the principles of faith."
LSC_no_masters:0 "No Gods, No Masters!"
LSC_no_masters_desc:0 "Historically, the Vartai has been a realm of faith and the faithful. Even in modern day this can be seen among some of the most prominent former partisans and current military leaders, who are truly devout believers. However it's precisely this focus on faith that resulted in brutalities that have been plaguing the region. If we want to break the cycle, faith and government must be separate."
LSC_tractor_stations:0 "Communal Tractor Stations"
LSC_tractor_stations_desc:0 "Even with substantial attempts at modernization and expanding our production abilities, we still have very little in the way of industry and machinery. Thus the few bits of industry we have will be reorganized and made communal to allow our peasantry to share them and thus use them to their full efficiency."
LSC_secret_services:0 "Vidaus Saugumo Agentūra"
LSC_secret_services_desc:0 "Despite decisively winning brutal civil war, we cannot escape the shadow of Pallas it seems, as even now there are claims Black Cloaks are still active. Thus, sadly, the most capable and ruthless of Longsword will be organized into the “Inner Security Agency” - VSA. The Black Cloaks will be given no mercy. And if we are forced to wage wars against other radicals, we will wield VSA to crush them too."
LSC_posniaks:0 "The Posniak Issue"
LSC_posniaks_desc:0 "Posniaks - ponies that worship the three main griffon gods, believing that they have “adopted” them, have been present in Vartai and Longsword from the start of crusades. Before Pallas came to power, they were believed to be better than other ponies and had a better position. This means that their position in our new country is a bit controversial, and thus we must decide what to do with them."
LSC_role_division:0 "Encourage Division of Roles"
LSC_role_division_desc:0 "A modern society, unfortunately, cannot rely solely on just the peasantry. We must encourage a division of roles among Longsword's communes, pushing some of them to become industrial unions or provide services to their countrymen, rapidly modernizing our economic system."
LSC_agrarian_realism:0 "Agrarian Realism"
LSC_agrarian_realism_desc:0 "Much of the previous art produced in Longsword is either so old it's difficult to understand and relate to for most, or made purely to glorify griffon imperialism. This won't do, not in a new Longsword! Thus we will embrace a new direction of art - realism. And using it we will show our citizens how important the struggles of each and every one of them are to the prosperity of their homeland."
LSC_rights_of_the_people:0 "Establish a Bill of Rights"
LSC_rights_of_the_people_desc:0 "With Longsword stabilized and many of the most important reforms done, the time has come. Now we will finally try to creating a document ensuring the very basic civil and political rights, in potentially one of the most religiously and racially diverse regions of Griffonia with a past of conflict based on these differences. Hopefully, the end result will ensure peace and stability."

LSC_national_restoration:0 "National Restoration"
LSC_national_restoration_desc:0 "The Visaginas Constitutional Convention and it's results have shown everyone in the country, that despite the dominance of figures such as the lowborn Starry Night and lunatic Abba Povner during the conflict, the populace desires to return to a more beautiful, natural and harmonic age. And we, nobles and Longswordian Kings, will fulfill this desire as is our duty."
LSC_national_education:0 "New Education Programs"
LSC_national_education_desc:0 "The tyrant and traitor Pallas has left Longsword brutalized and desolate, with the populace illiterate and lacking in even the most basic knowledge about their history. This cannot be allowed, especially if we are to return to tradition. Thus, we must strive towards literacy, so that every citizen can learn to read about our great history."
LSC_restitution_of_ownership:0 "Restitution of Pony Ownership"
LSC_restitution_of_ownership_desc:0 "During his rule, Pallas Dusktalon committed many crimes and injustices, one of which was taking away the rightful property of hundreds of ponies. With our ascendance to leadership over Longsword, we can right this wrong by returning domains and workshops to all the rightful pony owners. It's not as if owners assigned by Pallas are around to object."
LSC_rebuild_varena:0 "Rebuild the Romuva of Varėna"
LSC_rebuild_varena_desc:0 "Varėna, even during the rule of Pallas Dusktalon, was a fortress of our culture and faith. However, even if the populace persisted, the buildings didn't. The Ramovė of Varėna - the greatest temple of our warrior faith, was destroyed during the crusades. As a symbol of Longsword reborn, we will rebuild this temple even greater than before!"
LSC_kriwe_classes:0 "Restore the Kriwe Class"
LSC_kriwe_classes_desc:0 "Kriwe - the warrior-priests and chosen of Goddess of War and Hunt Varėnė, fell to the last pony defending the original Ramovė of Varėna, though some claim the ridiculous . With Ramovė of Varėna restored, it's only natural to revive the Kriwe as their own class again."
LSC_promote_local_dialects:0 "Promote Local Dialects"
LSC_promote_local_dialects_desc:0 "One of the beauties of old Longsword and every region that were domains or aligned with our Great Dukes, were the countless and diverse dialects created by unique conditions of the region. While many dialects have been assimilated into main languages or wiped out completely, we can at least try preserving what's left."
LSC_convert_posniaks:0 "Bring Posniaks Back to the Right Path"
LSC_convert_posniaks_desc:0 "We do not hate the griffons or their creator gods. However ponies of Vartai worshiping these divinities is a betrayal to both our traditions and even the concept of a free Vartai. Thus, while we will not try to do so with force, we will try our best to have the Posniaks convert back to the proper faith."
LSC_establish_seimas:0 "Establish the Seimas"
LSC_establish_seimas_desc:0 "While we oppose the tyranny of the unenlightened masses, we are not enemies to the idea of democracy, we are not insane autocrats, such as the cursed Pallas. Thus we will establish the Seimas, a parliamentary institution, where the upper echelons of Longswordian society will decide how to better create a harmonious and prosperous realm."
LSC_sixty_corporations:0 "The Sixty Corporations"
LSC_sixty_corporations_desc:0 "In a harmonious society, everyone has a role. Everyone is accounted for and everyone contributes to prosperity. We shall organize all professions in the country into sixty professional associations, which will be able to care for their own and defend their interests."
LSC_griffon_territorial_autonomies:0 "Griffon Territorial Autonomies"
LSC_griffon_territorial_autonomies_desc:0 "While we were historically enemies, many griffons assisted the rebellion against Dusktalon. Thus, just like how a claw was extended to us a hundred years ago, we will extend a hoof to them. With agreement of most of Longswordian Kings, several griffon dominated regions will be turned into autonomous entities governed by griffon nobles that aligned themselves with us."
LSC_enforce_local_democracy:0 "Enforce Village Democracy"
LSC_enforce_local_democracy_desc:0 "Only the scions of nobility are truly suitable to govern a state. But when it comes to local matters, assistance of peasantry can become invaluable. Thus a system where villages elect representatives to help local elites with governance will be created for a more fair and harmonic society. Furthermore, creatures who believe in their society will fight harder to protect it."
LSC_autarky:0 "Pursue Resource Autarky"
LSC_autarky_desc:0 "Both historically and even as recently as the rule of Pallas Dusktalon, Longsword was lacking in accessible resources. While initially it wasn't such a huge issue, industrialization and evolution of warfare means that with our current ability, we can't even properly defend our idyllic utopia. This, of course, can not be allowed to continue."
LSC_folwark_system:0 "Reform the Folwark System"
LSC_folwark_system_desc:0 "The Folwark system, a regional variation of the once widespread institution of serfdom, has always been immoral and limiting, kept around by Dusktalon's only due to profitability. And now it's lost even that. There is no point in keeping the current system and thus it will be reformed for something more beneficial and acceptable to both peasant and lord."
LSC_harmonic_identity:0 "Construct the Žemaitukas Monument"
LSC_harmonic_identity_desc:0 "Of all the warlord dukes, Žemaitukas was the greatest, matching even Grover II in ability and only losing when griffons crushed his armies with numbers. To commemorate his greatness, we will construct a monument befitting him. And with this and countless other similar projects, we will remind Longswordians that we are a nation of proud warriors and heroes."
LSC_national_myth:0 "Faith, Harmony, Nationality"
LSC_national_myth_desc:0 "With our faith restored to it's true greatness, our populace knowledgeable and proud of their history and the rightful heirs and descendants of our greatest heroes in charge an idyllic and harmonic age is back. Our citizens are not just peasants or rag tag guerrillas anymore, they are proud and faithful citizen-warriors, led by inheritors of mythical legacy, ready to defend out greatness once again."

LSC_violet_revolution:0 "The Violet Revolution"
LSC_violet_revolution_desc:0 "Our success during the period of chaos that followed the destruction of Reformisten forces have shown that our path is the true and righteous one as we achieved victory over both the misguided and weak reactionaries and collectivists. Now the time has come to push Longsword and Vartai towards it's true destiny as the unifier of East and West!"
LSC_fascist_education:0 "Patriotic Education Programs"
LSC_fascist_education_desc:0 "Both the Baltieji and Raudonieji were right in a way - they claimed that we should educate the populace, immerse them in science, literature and history. But they don't understand that we should go beyond! We will teach our citizens not just facts and stories, but shape them into model citizens, the Longswordian super-culture."
LSC_interspecies_study_groups:0 "Inter-Species Study Groups"
LSC_interspecies_study_groups_desc:0 "It's absurd that despite hundreds of years of existing together in Vartai, so few consider the possibility of combining griffon and pony talents and magic. We must fix this mistake by forming mandatory inter-species study groups in all of academia, to integrate ponies and griffons into one."
LSC_pantheon_construction:0 "New Pantheon Construction"
LSC_pantheon_construction_desc:0 "There are examples of both ponies worshiping the creator gods of griffons and griffons praying to pantheons of Riverlands, with both being able to channel divine abilities from these deities. Golden Morning himself is a believer of both the Griffon gods and Varėnė and claims that these faiths are fully compatible. Thus, he claims, to achieve our goal, these faiths will be reconstructed into one."
LSC_language_reconstruction:0 "Transformation of Language"
LSC_language_reconstruction_desc:0 "The National Transformation must take root in all sections of society and all parts of life, public of private. Even the language we speak shapes us into who we are - therefore, we must control it. We shall print little books of phrases and dictionaries as study material and means of language standardization. The words of "pony" and "griffon" will be erased - we are all simply creatures."
LSC_ideocracy:0 "Ideocracy"
LSC_ideocracy_desc:0 "Ideocracy is the core concept of the Naujoji Grifonija party - the rule of the idea. We reign not because Golden Morning and his followers desire power, but because an idea shines above all of them. Longsword has a great destiny in front of it, and the nation needs to be transformed into a suitable vessel for it."
LSC_forced_integration:0 "Forced Integration"
LSC_forced_integration_desc:0 "Despite fighting side by side against the idiot tyrant Dusktalon, the ponies and griffons of Longsword in many cases still self-segregate and even sometimes allegedly discriminate the other. In the face of our great goal such absurd pettiness is not allowed. All Longswordians will see each other as brothers and sisters in spirit, even if we have to force the belief into them."
LSC_vadeiva_cult:0 "Cult of the Vadeiva"
LSC_vadeiva_cult_desc:0 "For most creatures, an abstract ideal is hard to truly understand and rally around. They need a symbol for which they can work, fight and perish. For us, this symbol will be our Vadeiva - Golden Morning, the champion of both Varėnė and Arcturius and the great unifier of East and West."
LSC_little_books:0 "Totalitarian Social Engineering"
LSC_little_books_desc:0 "When a greater ideal is concerned, no holds can be barred. The citizens need to learn that their lives are at the command of destiny, and by force, we will instill this understanding. They can be moved from town to city as the need requires it, they can take up arms or stand down and die as soon as they are ordered, they say what they are ordered to say, they do what they are ordered to do. And there is no alternative."
LSC_political_spectacle:0 "Cult of the Political Spectacle"
LSC_political_spectacle_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, a huge chunk of the population are still passive towards our ideal. But that's not an issue. We already know minds and souls bend with the correct push. If we surround our ideological opponents with propaganda and supporters of our ideology, after some time they will bend and adapt, if not to our beliefs, then at least our methods and loyalty to the state."
LSC_national_body_stratification:0 "Stratification of the National Body"
LSC_national_body_stratification_desc:0 "Nations are organisms, where each and every part has a role to fulfill. But some roles are more important than others. The mind and heart must command the rest of the body, and the rest of the body surrender all of its resources towards the goal which the mind sets. And the mind calls for an era of war. We must enter permanent militarization until all of Griffonia is united under our whim."
LSC_mandatory_firearms_training:0 "Mandatory Firearms Training"
LSC_mandatory_firearms_training_desc:0 "Longswordians are warriors forged in flames of crusade and civil war. It's due to this history that our citizenry will be catalyst for the great unification. However this greatness will evaporate under the tide of apathy caused by peace if allowed. With this in mind, we will supply every single citizen with a weapon and teach, and force if we have to, them to use it to fight for our great goal. "
LSC_supremacy_of_will:0 "Supremacy of Will"
LSC_supremacy_of_will_desc:0 "If looked at our position purely from the perspective of materialism, our state is as good as lost, surrounded by more industrial and advanced countries. But we are not materialists! We know the power of spirit! We will eliminate this industrial and scientific gap through pure force of will and sheer spirit if we have to!"
LSC_militarized_labour:0 "Militarization of Labour"
LSC_militarized_labour_desc:0 "The modern military is the most efficient institution in achieving it's goals. With this in mind, it's absurd that the civilian sector is allowed to remain so chaotic when such an organized model exists parallel to it. Yet another mistake that we will fix in our march towards the future. Our laborers will no longer be a chaotic mass, they will be an army in their own right - an army of labour!"
LSC_longsword_above_all:0 "Ilgakardija Aukščiau Visko!"
LSC_longsword_above_all_desc:0 "Longsword is not the pile of rubble it was after the war, it's not even a mere country. Longsword is a well oiled machine that pushes the populace and it's spirit towards the very limit for the greatest goal and destiny in Griffonia."
LSC_primitive_accumulation:0 "Primitive Resource Accumulation"
LSC_primitive_accumulation_desc:0 "While Longsword has been turned into a militarized machine geared towards victory, we can perhaps experiment with pushing our ability even further. We will encourage successful workers to perform better and better by giving them better life opportunities. And if those that are inefficient are left in the dust... Well there is no place for the slow and weak when moving towards a our goal."
LSC_economic_subordination:0 "Economic Subordination"
LSC_economic_subordination_desc:0 "Longsword does not possess much industry, something which damaged us greatly during the civil war, and is still a great issue. But what we do possess, especially now, are quite a few professional and hundreds of amateur weapon makers. By putting all these minor business and workshops under the direct control of the state, we might perhaps somewhat lessen or eliminate the industrial gap."
LSC_full_employment:0 "Full Employment"
LSC_full_employment_desc:0 "With the drastic changes in both the political, economic and societal landscape of Longsword, many a creature, both pony and griffon, were left without a permanent occupation or an occupation at all. This will not do. All these unemployed creatures will be organized into labour units which will be used to assist in industries lacking in necessary creaturepower to function properly."

LSC_divine_revolution:0 "The Vengeful Revolution"
LSC_divine_revolution_desc:0 "Our revolution is not the one of workers or peasants. It's the revolution of the faithful, those who endured with grim determination against all those who tried to destroy everything we stand for and repaid them in kind. And now we have risen for free and faithful Longsword! And perhaps for greater vengeance..."
LSC_monument_to_the_fallen:0 "Remember The Fallen"
LSC_monument_to_the_fallen_desc:0 "So many have died until now... So many slain by the crusaders, then black cloaks and now the violet traitors of Varėnė. So many- nobles, heroes, holy men, simple warriors and mere peasants. All will be remembered in some way, bet it monument or writing. For where would we be now, without their sacrifices?"
LSC_and_punish_their_killers:0 "And Punish the Criminal"
LSC_and_punish_their_killers_desc:0 "And so many have betrayed us... So many corrupted by the violet light of Golden Morning. Many of them survived the battle, broken in will and soul. They will pay with their lives. Furthermore, any movement that was ever aligned to New Griffonia, will be disarmed as untrustworthy and potentially traitorous."
LSC_teach_faith_and_history:0 "Cultural Education Reform"
LSC_teach_faith_and_history_desc:0 "An illiterate and lacking in knowledge populace is easy to convert and assimilate. This, before the rise of reformisten, was how the Imperials were trying to exterminate us. We will educate the faithful so that nothing like this happens again. And when it comes to local griffons... They can learn local speech."
LSC_rebuild_the_temples:0 "Restore the Alkavietės"
LSC_rebuild_the_temples_desc:0 "Alkavietės are the primal places of our, pre-date proper temples and the Romuva. But while the temples burned, the wild alkavietės persisted. Furthermore, according to Povner, they are far more holy, even if certain rituals performed there are... questionable. Thus we will restore these blessed places across Longsword."
LSC_expand_avengers:0 "Expand the Kerštininkai"
LSC_expand_avengers_desc:0 "The Kerštininkai - Avengers, Povner's personal guerilla force, were already prominent and famous under Starry's Raudonieji as a group of zealots notable in their terror and purge campaigns against black cloak supporters. Many enemies of the faithful remain, and thus many new avengers will rise to enact justice. "
LSC_warrior_priests:0 "Expand the Ranks of Vaidilos"
LSC_warrior_priests_desc:0 "The vaidilos are the most ancient religious institution in Vartai. They are not fattened priests living in luxurious temples. Rather they persist in villages and near alkavietės, helping the faithful in times of crisis and leading them to battle against would be oppressors"
LSC_bring_them_back_to_the_real_path:0 "Bring Them Back to Righteousness"
LSC_bring_them_back_to_the_real_path_desc:0 "Posniaks are nothing more than traitors! They have betrayed their culture, faith and as the actions of Golden Morning and New Griffonia have proven, nothing more than traitors in waiting. But we are merciful. We will allow them to repent and absolve themselves by going back to the true faith."
LSC_welcome_back_outcasts:0 "Welcome Them Back To The Genesis"
LSC_welcome_back_outcasts_desc:0 "Many a Vartai pony fled their homeland during the centuries of Imperial rule. Comrade Povner claims that while exiles and outcasts were weak of spirit, their descendants are faithful, brave and patriotic and thus should be invited and welcomed back to their "Genesis" to aid in it's rebirth and future defence."
LSC_griffon_believers:0 "Gather the Converts"
LSC_griffon_believers_desc:0 "It seems, according to claims of Comrade Povner, that Ludwig von Pliater is not some extreme exception. Allegedly, there are many a griffon knight lacking belief and conviction roaming Griffonia that he could turn, or has turned to our faith and goal. While some posses doubt over Povner's claims, they don't dare to question or protest as he departs to gather these new converts."
LSC_her_dream:0 "Enact Her Dream"
LSC_her_dream_desc:0 "Starry Night had a beautiful and rather utopian dream for Longsword and Vartai. While most of Povner's comrades considered it rather childish, he himself seemed to have a soft spot for the unicorn. Thus to honour her memory and dreams, we will try implementing her ideal society the best we can. "
LSC_hands_off_collectivization:0 "Hooves-Off Collectivization"
LSC_hands_off_collectivization_desc:0 "Starry Night disagreed with many of the more radical communists when it came to such aspects of revolution such as collectivization. She believed that this process has to be achieved voluntarily, not by force. We will respect her wish and allow the peasantry to collectivise by themselves."
LSC_basic_rights_for_longswordians:0 "Longswordian Bill of Rights"
LSC_basic_rights_for_longswordians_desc:0 "Even before Longsword was liberated, Starry Night had outlined some basic concepts for a just and fair system of law for Longsword. An utopian document at it's core, it did leave a quite a few aspects malleable due to ever shifting political allegiances. We will adopt most of it, with the exception of parts about justice and punishment. "
LSC_agrarian_lifestyle:0 "The Agrarian Ideal"
LSC_agrarian_lifestyle_desc:0 "Starry Night possessed a rather notable inclination to romanticize and idealize the agrarian, rural lifestyle and focus on peasants and simple soldiers over leaders and heroes. While this lack of glorification of the true base of society - faith, is slightly distasteful, out of respect for her we will support such lifestyle and works that glorify it."


LSC_lemiamas_suolis:0 "Lemiamas Šuolis"
LSC_lemiamas_suolis_desc:0 "For Longsword to catch up with the rest of the world, drastic and even somewhat extreme measures will be taken. The most important of these and the start of our industrial and economic program is the Lemiamas Šuolis - the “Decisive Leap”, the initial industrialization program from which every other step forwards will arise."
LSC_social_services:0 "Establish Social Security"
LSC_social_services_desc:0 "The issue of poverty has been plaguing Longsword far before even Pallas Dusktalon ruined the country and the civil war tore what was left to shreds. We can't offer the poor souls that are forced to live in this situation much, at least monetary. But we will provide them with food and a chance to work for the expanding and reforming state apparatus in one way or another."
LSC_urbanization:0 "Urbanization"
LSC_urbanization_desc:0 "While we believe that the spirit and soul of Longsword is in it's rural countryside and the great forests, we cannot deny that the core of a modern country is in the urban centers. With this in mind, we are simply forced to expand our cities and their industrial cores. Though hopefully, with enough effort we can still keep the countryside vibrant and lived in and not abandoned in favour of urban sprawls."
LSC_railway_modernization:0 "Railway Modernization"
LSC_railway_modernization_desc:0 "Despite the underdeveloped local industry, one aspect of industrialization that was present in the duchy, were countless railroads built during the imperial golden era to supply the Rosewood order with equipment for the eternal crusade. While after the collapse many of these railroads have fallen into disrepair, it will be a comparatively easy task to restore them for our own usage."
LSC_land_redistribution:0 "Begin Land Redistribution"
LSC_land_redistribution_desc:0 "Both the tyranny of Pallas and the following civil war, left hundreds of thousands dead, many of which were landowners and farmers. Their lands are now left abandoned to be consumed by the wilds again. However, while it's a result of horrible action, it does provide us an opportunity. By redistributing this land to the destitute, we will hopefully alleviate poverty and increase agricultural production."
LSC_textile_industry:0 "Promote the Textile Industry"
LSC_textile_industry_desc:0 "Our pony citizens are inheritors of a great textile production tradition, dating to far before the rise of even the first Griffonian Empires. Even during the rule of Black Cloaks this tradition was maintained by tens of thousands of rural ponies. With how much of our population is knowledgeable in this industry, it only makes sense to push it to the front of our recovering civilian economy."
LSC_rural_reconstruction:0 "Rural Reconstruction Movement"
LSC_rural_reconstruction_desc:0 "While the overwhelming concentration of the populace in the rural and sometimes borderline completely wild regions of Longsword did allow the native populace to persist through the genocides and repressions, it also meant that the black cloaks used extremely brutal tactics trying to hunt ponies down. This left many villages devastated, something that we cannot leave unadressed."
LSC_export_agriculture:0 "Grain for Machinery"
LSC_export_agriculture_desc:0 "Even with some of the more drastic measures proposed to catch up with our more industrialized neighbors, our industrial ability is still heavily lacking. On the opposite side, despite our recent history, the agricultural sector is booming. Perhaps, despite our ideological views, some countries would be willing to supply us with machinery if we provide cheap and good enough foodstuffs."
LSC_central_industrial_region:0 "Santaka Central Industrial Region"
LSC_central_industrial_region_desc:0 "While the old Duchy was barely industrialized, the capital did possess quite a bit of industrial ability. Furthermore several parts of the city have been prepared for further expansion before the rise of Reformisten, where such ambitions were stifled. But in our case, this goes perfectly into our industrial expansion plans and we would be fools to waste it."
LSC_applied_research:0 "Duke Eržilas Research Institute"
LSC_applied_research_desc:0 "Duke Eržilas, while not as idealized as Žemaitukas, is still a very important historical figure in our history. With this in mind, we will honor his memory and legacy with by naming the first true university in Longsword in his honor."
LSC_new_arms_industries:0 "New Industrial Towns"
LSC_new_arms_industries_desc:0 "During the last few decades weaponry has evolved endlessly. If we wish to persist in this unfair world, we have to move forwards too.

LSC_resource_prospects:0 "Kupiškis Resource Prospects"
LSC_resource_prospects_desc:0 "There are great mineral riches in Longsword, simply ignored for almost two centuries as our occupants were either too concerned with their crusades and later on attempted genocide to attempt exploiting them for the benefit of all. At least they bothered to map out where we might find these riches. It seems Kupiškis will become a great mining city in the future."

LSC_hellquill_harcom:0 "Free the Ponies of Hellquill"

LSC_vartai_republic:0 "Declare the Vartai Republic"
LSC_vartai_republic_desc:0 "Vartai, "the Gate", is how our ancestors called the land divided between Hellquill and Longsword. It used to signify this region's position between the Griffons of the West and Ponies of the East. Once again reunited with Hellquill, we can revive this name to call our expanded nation with - it is no longer just Longsword anymore, is it?"
LSC_fate_of_reformisten:0 "Fate of the Reformisten"
LSC_fate_of_reformisten_desc:0 "The Reformisten developed their toxic ideology in the knightly halls of the Hellquill Order. Today, they will receive what is due.

LSC_seek_allies:0 "Our Future in Griffonia"
LSC_seek_allies_desc:0 "With Hellquill annexed and the Vartai region united under our banner, it is time for us to look outwards. Griffonia has changed a lot in the past few years, and in the midst of some of the most deadly wars to break out in history, where should our loyalty stand?"
LSC_never_again:0 "Never Again"
LSC_never_again_desc:0 "Once, we have been brought to the brink of extinction by the Reformisten and the Imperials. Now, free once again, we must ensure that history never repeats.

LSC_prepare_arsenic:0 "Stockpile Arsenic"
LSC_prepare_arsenic_desc:0 "The poisonous qualities of arsenic are very well known, and so is the fact that it can be injected into food and water to turn it poisonous. When it comes to indiscriminate revenge, there can be no holds barred - therefore, we must stockpile this substance for further use."
LSC_black_books:0 "The Black Book"
LSC_black_books_desc:0 "We should compile a list of griffons in Herzland who are either complicit in the murder of Longswordian ponies, could have stopped it and yet did not, or would possibly repeat this bloodbath if given the chance.

LSC_hellquill_supremacist:0 "Destroy Hellquill"
LSC_hellquill_supremacist_desc:0 "The Knightly Order of Hellquill to the north is an aberration to everything which our destiny stands for. Every day it is allowed to exist is a day in which the rift between ponies and griffons grows deeper. To arms! We shall erase it from history!"

LSC_integrate_hellquill_supremacist:0 "Integrate Hellquill"
LSC_integrate_hellquill_supremacist_desc:0 "We need to abolish the military administration in Hellquill territories and fully integrate them into our administrative structure, and seek out friendly political forces in the country who can work with us."
LSC_sirdis:0 "The Heart"
LSC_sirdis_desc:0 "United under a single banner by force, the Ponies and Griffons will need a capital, a beating heart of the National Body to guide the entire nation from. Let us become this Heart. From here, a new page in the history of Griffonia will turn, and the future will change forever."
LSC_attack_west:0 "Descend to the West"
LSC_attack_west_desc:0 "The Griffon west is an active civilization of efficiency and ambition. After all, the griffons have forged great realms by the dozens, while only a couple great empires rose in the east. Furthermore, even in a state of collapse, their technology and industry is still superior to what Riverlanders possess, despite a veritable golden age. But they lack spirituality and thus we will descend on them, and we will ignite their spirits."
LSC_restore_universities:0 "New Universities for a New Future"
LSC_restore_universities_desc:0 "When it comes to science, the universities of Herzland are beacons shining so great, that everything else looks like darkness. Furthermore, with the sort of things one can find in the basements of Yale biologists, these universities are also a place where we might find the biggest griffon supporters for our ideas. It's only logical to push these universities to a position of prominence within our new Empire."
LSC_fate_of_grover:0 "Fate of the Grover Lineage"
LSC_fate_of_grover_desc:0 "The Grover lineage has undeniably left an impact upon history and helped shaped Longsword into what it is - but this lineage set back the destiny of the continent for centuries. Their conquests caused strife between griffons and ponies, as well as the Knightly Orders they set up in Vartai. The last of this lineage, Grover VI, shall be the one to answer for these crimes."
LSC_integrate_herzland:0 "Ponification"
LSC_integrate_herzland_desc:0 "The griffon civilization is a great one indeed, but they do lack spirituality and empathy. After all they are known as one of the greediest and selfish races. Not even mentioned how they have to be forced to worship the very gods that made them. We will nullify this egoism and balance out the inherent ambition and greed of the west with the spirit and feeling of the east, thus “completing” the griffon race."
LSC_attack_east:0 "Ascend to the East"
LSC_attack_east_desc:0 "The pony east is a passive civilization of spirituality and empathy. After all, the ponies have forged group bonds so strong that they held great realms for centuries and millenniums. Furthermore while griffons have to be forced to worship, to ponies faith come naturally and inherently. But they lack ambition and thus we will ascend to them, and will capture their minds with dreams of greatness."
LSC_include_new_species:0 "New Species in the National Body"
LSC_include_new_species_desc:0 "While our great goal is to unify the Griffon West and Pony East, our conquests have resulted in millions of Diamond Dogs residing within our borders. While they were not a race that we initially accounted for in our ambition for perfect national body, it will not be difficult to integrate them. Their spirit of persistence and stability will be a great assistance in maintaining our perfect country."
LSC_abolish_riverfed:0 "Abolish the Treaty of Coltstream"
LSC_abolish_riverfed_desc:0 "Some see the Treaty of Colststream as the first step towards a true unification of the east. But we understand that it's simply just another attempt by one of the Riverlander states to enforce their own ideas on others. By formally abolishing this treaty we will show the cultural and spiritual outliers of Riverlands that we truly seek to unify and purify the true spirit of the east, not just an interpretation of it."
LSC_integrate_riverfed:0 "Griffonization"
LSC_integrate_riverfed_desc:0 "The pony civilization possess a great spirit indeed, but they do lack any true great ambition or aim towards advancement. After all the ponies are mostly passive unless forced to act. It's similar when it comes to their friendships and bonds. This idyllic ideal is stopping them from great scientific advancements. We will push out this apathy with burning ambition of the west, thus “completing” the pony race."
LSC_griffking_empire:0 "Proclaim the Griffking Empire"
LSC_griffking_empire_desc:0 "Finally, with both the west griffon and east pony civilizations and spirits united, we can proclaim a great realm which represents our exceptional achievement of mending both spirits. And the only fitting name for such a domain is based on the river which unites both Riverlands and Herzland - the Griffking."
LSC_endgame:0 "A Grateful World"
LSC_endgame_desc:0 "We have triumphed against all odds and against all enemies of our grand and divine destiny and achieved the impossible! A new dawn rises on a continent physically united, and spiritually completed. And a new morning is coming to a truly happy and grateful world."

LSC_IIA:0 "Longsword Liberation Army"
LSC_IIA_desc:0 "While we won the civil war, the armed forces under our command are decentralized and chaotic, most likely unable to combat a proper and organized force. Thus for our survival and future, the partisan army will be forged into a true and fearsome military force."
LSC_defensive_army:0 "Let Them Come to Us!"
LSC_defensive_army_desc:0 "Even if we might desire, we do not have the capability to wage an aggressive and offensive war. Our only way to win is to dig in, grit our teeth and clench out beaks, turn our will into iron and endure. "
LSC_offensive_army:0 "An Army of Offense"
LSC_offensive_army_desc:0 "By hoping to endure and outlast our enemies we have already lost our freedom to the Griffonian Empire. We will not allow this to repeat. We will be the ones who overrun the enemy and crush their defences. And any lack of artillery or armour will have to be compensated with spirit."
LSC_military_academy:0 "Duke Žemaitukas Military Academy"
LSC_military_academy_desc:0 "Grand Duke Žemaitukas was the unifier of Longsword and a great champion of Varėnė and, according to some, the father of our very nation and culture. It's only natural to name our very first military academy after him."
LSC_weapons_fund:0 "Ginklų Fondas"
LSC_weapons_fund_desc:0 "One of the greatest issues we faced during the civil war was the lack of ability to produce weapons. In case of another conflict, we might again lose our production facilities. That's why we will create the "ginklų fondas"- weapon's fund, meant to ensure that we always possess means of defence."
LSC_attrition_tactics:0 "Attrition Tactics"
LSC_attrition_tactics_desc:0 "The forests and swamps of our homeland and our ability to use them ensured our victories, or at least less brutal defeats in wars we fought in for a millennia. Even in modern day such tactics are viable and we must always be ready to fall back on them if the need arises."
LSC_engineer_earthworks:0 "Sapper Regiments"
LSC_engineer_earthworks_desc:0 "Considering our military situation and ability, we must ensure that our troops are ready to capitalize on any potential natural shielding to win their battles. Thus the veterans of the civil war with suitable experience will be tasked to prepare entire regiments knowledgeable in this craft."
LSC_arms_manufacturing:0 "Local Arms Manufacturing"
LSC_arms_manufacturing_desc:0 "We do not have many friends and far less nations or even companies, willing to sell us weapons. Thus the only option left for us, is to strive for self-sufficiency, at least when it comes to the most basic weaponry and equipment."
LSC_bite_and_hold:0 "Bite-and-Hold Tactics"
LSC_bite_and_hold_desc:0 "The lack of artillery and armour means that we cannot rely on either traditional or modern offensive strategies. Thus a new set of more suitable tactics has been devised. We will seize small chunks of land instead of large swathes; slowly crushing our enemy till nothing remains."
LSC_offensive_tactics:0 "Shock and Awe"
LSC_offensive_tactics_desc:0 "If the enemy has lost their will to fight and is consumed by terror and dream, they will most likely surrender or flee. While such tactics might seem overly brutal, if the enemy breaks early, we can preserve countless lives. Thus, while distasteful, we will adopt morale shattering tactics."
LSC_magical_infantry_focus:0 "Mandatory Service for Unicorns"
LSC_magical_infantry_focus_desc:0 "While not on the same level as Wittenland, the pony populace of Vartai has a massive percentage of unicorns. While this might seem unfair, our lacking populace forces us to make military service mandatory for unicorns, due to both their offensive and healing capabilities."
LSC_armored_unit:0 "Šarvuočių rinktinė"
LSC_armored_unit_desc:0 "We can never hope to compete with the armour fielding juggernauts such as the accursed Griffonian Empire. We most likely can't even make them a normal sight in our forces. But in some cases it's impossible to win without tanks, and we have to be prepared for those cases. "
LSC_live_combat_exercises:0 "Live Combat Exercises"
LSC_live_combat_exercises_desc:0 "There are many weapons remaining after the civil war, and many of the personnel that used them among our ranks. With this in mind we will organize combat exercises in order to prepare to fight any Imperial or Herzlander force that might come after us."
LSC_innovative_military:0 "Foster Military Innovation"
LSC_innovative_military_desc:0 "The art of war has evolved and advanced much during the last decades and if we are to reach the same level and match up with the ever speeding up development, we will encourage military innovation. "
LSC_ILKS:0 "Ilgakardžių Laisvės Kovos Sąjūdis"
LSC_ILKS_desc:0 "While one dreads to think of such a possibility, Longsword might yet again be occupied by an enemy in the future. Thus as a last resort, we will prepare and forge an organization which will be ready to take the mantle of government and military if the state falls and fight on – the ILKS."
LSC_nation_defense_planning:0 "Nationwide Defense Planning"
LSC_nation_defense_planning_desc:0 "If our homeland is ever threatened by an enemy again, every single citizen and soldier must be prepared to do their patriotic duty and work as a part of a greater whole. Thus every single citizen will be drilled and prepared to fulfill their role on an almost instinctual level. "
LSC_fortifications:0 "The Starry Line"
LSC_fortifications_desc:0 "If there is one useful and positive thing to be learned from the tyrants which had enslaved us, it's their usage of fortifications, for we learned through suffering and blood just how much they can aid in defence. And now we will apply these lessons to defend against our enemies."
LSC_national_spirit:0 "Priešą parklupdyk!"
LSC_national_spirit_desc:0 "The civil war has left us scarred and in some cases deformed, that is true. But it has also left us far stronger and determined than we have been before. And thus even against all odds we will hold the enemy back, through spirit and will alone if we have to."
LSC_griffon_tech:0 "Griffon Technology Research"
LSC_griffon_tech_desc:0 "While during the civil war we were unable to learn the secrets of griffon magic due to how most of partisan griffons were former soldiers or knights, our victory and a wave of new supporters means that we can finally unlock the secrets of griffon magic and how it reacts to pony one."
LSC_national_airforce:0 "Army Aviation Corps"
LSC_national_airforce_desc:0 "While few news reach us about conflicts and events abroad, it seems that the skies are becoming one of the most important fields of warfare in the modern era. Thus it is most likely that any enemy that invades will do so through both land and air. And we have to be prepared for that."
LSC_duster_places:0 "Develop Crop Dusting"
LSC_duster_places_desc:0 "Crop dusting is a modern way to increase agricultural yields requiring planes. While investing into such a field might seem questionable, some rather respectable military leaders claim both these planes and pilots could be very easily converted to military ones if a need arises."
LSC_fighter_focus:0 "Tarpanas Nori Būti Ore"
LSC_fighter_focus_desc:0 "A pony engineer by the name of Tarpanas has become quite famous for buildings tens of fighter planes of his own design. Such initiative must be rewarded and thus the designs of Tarpanas and his company "Tarpan wants to fly" will be adopted as our main fighter model."
LSC_defense_strategy:0 "Prioritize Air Defense"
LSC_defense_strategy_desc:0 "We do not have the means to match our enemies in the skies. The only thing we can do is to prepare for an attack from above. For this purpose countless emplacements will be built across the country to combat enemy fighters. After all they don't fly so good without wings."
LSC_mass_air_production:0 "An Airforce of Offense"
LSC_mass_air_production_desc:0 "The heavens above are perhaps the only front where our most likely inferior creature power will not matter. Thus we must strive to always dominate the skies, for if we can achieve victory there, we can also nullify our disadvantage on the ground. "

LSM_zeltstadt_meeting:0 "A Meeting in Zeltstadt"
LSM_zeltstadt_meeting_desc:0 "Having successfully freed Longsword from radicalism on the left and on the right, the Kamarilla now gathers in Zeltstadt to decide the fate of Longsword. Will it continue with the knightly virtue of old, or try to ascend into the new?"

LSM_go_with_wavewing:0 "Go with Wavewing"
LSM_go_with_wavewing_desc:0 "Hochmeisterin Konrada Wavewing sees in Longsword an opportunity to restore its pride and heritage. The knights of the Rosewood Order will be the guardians of the ways of old, and there will be nothing to stand in her way."
LSM_burn_revolutionary_books:0 "Burn Revolutionary Texts"
LSM_burn_revolutionary_books_desc:0 "Revolutionary corruption spreads not just through action, but through the written word too. If we wish to eliminate for such lunatics Black Cloaks or Povnerites to rise again, we must cleanse the libraries with flame."
LSM_assembly_of_knights:0 "Restore the Ritterschaftsausschuss"
LSM_assembly_of_knights_desc:0 "While the knights and knightly orders were by far the most politically dominant force in Longsword originally, the Dusktalon line managed to seize much of this power as time went on. However with both the count and his supporters gone, we can return knightly councils to their rightful position."
LSM_court_of_commoners:0 "The Court of Commoners"
LSM_court_of_commoners_desc:0 "While the noble tradition of knighthood makes knights far more suitable to rule and command, they are not suitable to fix issues faced and limited to commoners. It only makes sense to give the common folk a way to solve problems unworthy of knightly consideration."
LSM_devolution:0 "Devolution of Powers"
LSM_devolution_desc:0 "For most of the history of Longsword, any sort of central governance was impossible due to technological hurdles, thus knights took over such duty. While now means exist and Dusktalon certainly tried using them, we choose to return to tradition of knightly power over local projects."
LSM_rural_communes:0 "Form Rural Communes"
LSM_rural_communes_desc:0 "Even before being driven from towns and villages due to the Longswordian bloodbath, many peasants in our country preferred to live in single farms instead of communal villages prevalent elsewhere. This system is not only inefficient, but also insults the values of our state. It's only natural to institute a more acceptable system."
LSM_komtur_system:0 "Modernize the Komtur System"
LSM_komtur_system_desc:0 "During the golden years of our order, knight commanders were responsible for even the most local governance, production of material and defence. As our power waned, so did the prevalence and performance of the system. With our ascendancy, we will bring this traditional way of governance back to the prestigious position it deserves."
LSM_decentralize_education_system:0 "Decentralize the Education System"
LSM_decentralize_education_system_desc:0 "As the rule of fool Dusktalon showed, a centralized education system is but a way to push insane and destructive thoughts into the minds of the youth. The temples on the other hand, have never failed us before, and as long as we keep the lands of the order pure and virtuous, will not fail us."
LSM_virtue_policy:0 "Teach Virtue"
LSM_virtue_policy_desc:0 "Our order represents the greatest virtues known to the world - duty and self sacrifice. Thus everyone within our noble organization and in the lands that we control must understand and desire to not live for themselves, but to fight and die so that others wouldn't have to face the horrors of war."
LSM_patronage_arts_sciences:0 "Patronage of Arts and Sciences"
LSM_patronage_arts_sciences_desc:0 "We are no uncultured barbarians, nor do we oppose progress. What we do hate, is the independence of modern art from traditional noble and knightly supporters which ensured that art remained modern and valiant. While the system of patronage might have collapsed elsewhere, that won't happen here."
LSM_warrior_peasantry:0 "Wehrbauers"
LSM_warrior_peasantry_desc:0 "For all of our history, we were under threat of potential eastern invasion. Knights enough are not enough to hold back such hordes, thus we will revive the ancient tradition of Wehrbauers, giving landowners in borderlands special rights, as long as they fill up our military and assist in defence of the country."
LSM_smalltime_industry:0 "Promote Smalltime Industry"
LSM_smalltime_industry_desc:0 "While large magnates are corrupt degenerates and the workers of large industrial complexes often turn to revolutionary insanity, that doesn't mean industry is inherently evil. Small businesses, either belonging nobility or virtuous peasantry should be encouraged and even promoted."
LSM_pale_of_settlement:0 "The Pale of Settlement"
LSM_pale_of_settlement_desc:0 "We do not seek to destroy the ponies, but as the Pliaters and Tyzenhauzens have shown, pony faith and influence corrupts the faithful. Thus we must limit the settlement and governance of ponies to the south where they are currently the dominant group for both our and their safety."
LSM_modernization_of_agriculture:0 "Modernization of Agriculture"
LSM_modernization_of_agriculture_desc:0 "Longsword was and still is an agrarian state dominated by old methods of land working. This cannot do, especially if we desire to continue growing the numbers of our citizens and soldiers. Equipping our peasantry with modern tools and providing them better crops is the least we can do."
LSM_crusades_archive:0 "Archives of the Great Crusades"
LSM_crusades_archive_desc:0 "There are many stories and writings from the times of the Great Crusades, but many of them are scattered across the country and are in a sorry state. It's our duty to preserve our history and thus we will gather and restore these sources in a great archive so that all those who wish could learn of our glorious history."
LSM_zeltstadt_super_castle:0 "Construct the Große-Ordensburg"
LSM_zeltstadt_super_castle_desc:0 "For decades, our Grandmasters envisioned the construction of a massive fortress in Zeltstadt as a showcase of the might of the order. Today, with the resources of all of Longsword by our side, we can make this project see the light of day at last."
LSM_reenactments:0 "Battle Reenactments"
LSM_reenactments_desc:0 "An unused blade rusts and becomes blunt. It's the same with the knights who wield it. To prevent the members of our order from becoming complacent and weak, we will keep them sharp of mind and claw through reenactments of historic battles, so that art of war can be learned from victories and defeats of the ancients."
LSM_landtag:0 "Restore the Tradition of Landtags"
LSM_landtag_desc:0 "The Komturs and the Ritterschaftsausschuss are not enough for proper governance of a realm as diverse in conditions, religious, racial composition and knightly influence as Longsword. It only makes sense that with such issue, the old tradition of Landtags should be instituted again, for better regional governance."


LSM_go_with_silvertalon:0 "Go with Silvertalon"
LSM_go_with_silvertalon_desc:0 "General Conrad Silvertalon sees in Longsword a chance to restore its honor. The military will oversee a transformation of the state into a democratic, harmonious government."
LSM_provisional_government:0 "Form the Provisional Government"
LSM_provisional_government_desc:0 "A path to a harmonious and democratic government is long and hard, especially for place as brutalized as Longsword. For now an interim government will have to do."
LSM_new_state_organization:0 "Regierungsbezirk Organization"
LSM_new_state_organization_desc:0 "The history of local governance and organization in Longsword is chaotic to say the absolute least, often done by nobility and knights. If our goal is a true republic, all of this will have to be reorganized into a proper district system that accounts for it's subjects and cares for them."
LSM_soldier_worship:0 "Worship the Soldier"
LSM_soldier_worship_desc:0 "While some might argue that focusing on and glorifying the military is inherently anti-democratic and anti-harmonic, where would Longsword be now if it's brave soldiers didn't defeat both the mad Reformisten and the misguided revolutionaries? "
LSM_young_griffs:0 "Wandervögel"
LSM_young_griffs_desc:0 "The Wandervögel, or 'wandering birds', are a youth movement which call for a return to simple rural life and exhibit this goal by organizing hiking trips and youth communes. By endorsing this movement, we can turn it into a nationalist mouthpiece and draw recruits to the army while they are young."
LSM_military_pensions:0 "Reform the Military Pension System"
LSM_military_pensions_desc:0 "Support for radicalism rises from anger over inadequate conditions. This became especially notable as many of our former veterans aligned with the partisans due to inadequate pensions and lack of respect. If they are provided proper pensions for their lifestyles, they will not cause issues."
LSM_military_police_f:0 "Militärpolizei"
LSM_military_police_f_desc:0 "Before and during the Bloodbath, the police was subverted and radicalised by the Reformisten. With the previous law enforcement being untrustworthy, we are forced to relegate this duty to the military. At least they will learn how to keep potentially angry populations pacified if there is ever a need."
LSM_pony_suffrage:0 "Pony Suffrage"
LSM_pony_suffrage_desc:0 "Within Longsword, ponies are half of the population which was historically oppressed and denied denied self-governance and many rights. This cannot continue if we want a true republic. It will be difficult and take a lot, but ponies have to be taught democratic values for a true harmonic society."
LSM_import_legal_advisors:0 "Import Legal Advisors"
LSM_import_legal_advisors_desc:0 "Our own scholarly elite is simply under-equipped for the legal task for we desire to create a republic like none before. But there are some specialists of law from abroad with somewhat comparable experiences. We will invite them to help with this task."
LSM_bill_of_rights:0 "Longsword Bill of Rights"
LSM_bill_of_rights_desc:0 "Constructing a bill of rights that respects and defends two radically different races, cultures and faiths will be difficult, but that is the only way. At least we can be happy that such laws would allow for easier integration of potential new racial, cultural and religious groups into our republic."
LSM_fight_corruption:0 "War Against Corruption"
LSM_fight_corruption_desc:0 "The industries and civilian elements of Longsword are filled with corrupt and inadequate. This cannot be tolerated, for such elements can very easily subvert a nascent republic. Corrupt industrialists, administrators and bureaucrats have to go."
LSM_fight_extremism:0 "War Against Extremism"
LSM_fight_extremism_desc:0 "While the military didn't succumb to Reformisten insanity or partisan radicalism, there are still many extremists and opportunists who aligned with us due to rivalries and not actual beliefs. We will not allow these elements to persist and corrupt us from within."
LSM_engelberg_government:0 "The First Engelberg Government"
LSM_engelberg_government_desc:0 "Longsword has been stabilized, and General Silvertalon is now ready to return the instruments of governance to Solarpluff Engelberg. The soon to be Prime Minister and his cabinet will have a lot of issues to confront, but as long as he leads a stable, harmonic, democratic government, there is nothing he cannot resolve."
LSM_national_healing:0 "National Healing"
LSM_national_healing_desc:0 "We were too utopian, too ambitious. Longsword is too broken, too wounded... The wounds need to heal and a proper consciousness to rise. Until then, we will be watching and guiding it."
LSM_balanced_personhood:0 "The Concept of Balanced Personhood"
LSM_balanced_personhood_desc:0 "Our populace is too influenced by foreign ideas and foreign radicalism to understand their own local character and what it requires. Sadly, it seems we will be the ones who have to teach them to understand the unique Longswordian character and what a Longswordian person is."
LSM_military_governments:0 "Local Military Governance"
LSM_military_governments_desc:0 "It seems yet again the duties of the military are increasing as we are forced to replace the self-interested and too influenced by foreign ideas civilian administration. At least this way we can ensure that a truly apolitical force is in charge."
LSM_authority_structure:0 "Hierarchy of Authorities"
LSM_authority_structure_desc:0 "The easiest way to establish an idea among the populace is to allow it to seep down from top to bottom. This can be achieved through more defined hierarchies of power. Thus, to teach the populace we will be porting the stricter military structure to the civilian sector to promote the idea of balanced personhood."
LSM_moral_education:0 "Moral Education"
LSM_moral_education_desc:0 "Adults are too set in their ways to properly change their viewpoints into something more useful or positive, they will bend, but not break. The younger generation on the other claw, can be taught better ideas and values and will truly believe in them."
LSM_advisory_councils:0 "Establish Advisory Aufsichtrats"
LSM_advisory_councils_desc:0 "The businessgriffs of Longsword have too much power to be allowed to go on unsupervised. Thus, for a better and less corrupt and industrialist influenced society, all large businesses will be supervised by a council representing the interests and safety of the populace."
LSM_foster_new_culture:0 "Langschwertische Neuekultur"
LSM_foster_new_culture_desc:0 "While we do not desire to destroy the past and force everyone to forget it, the cultural values of both Longswordian griffon and pony, based greatly on conflict between these groups must be forgotten and something new and truly representing all Longswordians must take place. "
LSM_ideological_study_circles:0 "Ideological Study Circles"
LSM_ideological_study_circles_desc:0 "While foreign ideologies are often a negative influence as many of them subvert the idea of national character, that doesn't mean their study should be forbidden. But we should always remind our citizens that while those ideas might sound good, national character should always be considered."
LSM_form_the_castle:0 "Establish the Schlosstreue"
LSM_form_the_castle_desc:0 "It seems that finally, the wounds are slowly healing. Many military and civilian figures are now ready to truly work and fight for the true ideal of Longsword. Hopefully, this means that someday we can be but the "Castle" party within a democratic and prosperous country and not a military regime."
LSM_no_mercy:0 "No Mercy"
LSM_no_mercy_desc:0 "The weeks after the failure of our first republican attempt revealed an ugly truth as many movements and groups, thought as non-functional or gone, reappeared and began enacting their brutal ways again. We will not tolerate these totalitarian radicals any more. While it may be a hard, there is no other choice."
LSM_political_prison_system:0 "Political Prison System"
LSM_political_prison_system_desc:0 "We are no savage beasts, we will not simply butcher those whose crimes are not so horrible. However they will have to repay for all the death and damage they caused. And they will, be it through property, or through labour."
LSM_crack_down_on_reformisten:0 "Crack Down on the Reformisten"
LSM_crack_down_on_reformisten_desc:0 "Somehow, despite all that was done, the curse of Reformisten still persists within our state. Reduced to nothing more than roaming gangs of bandits, they terrorize isolated villages and settlements, believing they can still win. This will not be allowed or tolerated!"
LSM_crack_down_on_partisans:0 "Destroy Partisan Remnants"
LSM_crack_down_on_partisans_desc:0 "Most partisans surrendered and integrated back into society when they were defeated. Some refused, however, and continue to fight on, seeking nothing less than a totalitarian Longsword, bent to some sort absurd idea of vengeance or greatness. Such madness must be put down."
LSM_burn_forests:0 "Burn the Forests"
LSM_burn_forests_desc:0 "Both the reformisten and partisan remnants persist mostly in our great forests, battling each other across the wilderness while also seeking to seize leadership. As other methods failed, we are forced to use scorched earth tactics to burn out these diseases. Hopefully, we can restore the forests after."
LSM_secret_police:0 "Secret Police"
LSM_secret_police_desc:0 "Their supporters are imprisoned and their forces are truly crushed, yet the radical ideologies seem to persist as whispers of totalitarian ideals spread through shady bars and hidden basements. It seems, that to truly root out these movements, we will sadly have to employ the same tactics they would."
LSM_contitution_novelization:0 "Novelization of the Constitution"
LSM_contitution_novelization_desc:0 "One cannot dismiss the fears that either the civil war or radical activity will resume again in the future. This has forced us to amend the constitution in preparation, ensuring that in those cases there is always a strong leader and military ready to root them out."


LSM_rekonstruktion:0 "Rekonstruktion"
LSM_rekonstruktion_desc:0 "The Longsword Civil War has left the land a smouldering mess - cities have been bombed, infrastructure has been ruined, and the economy left a shell of its former self. Only after a long period of reconstruction will our people once again be willing to take up arms against our enemies."
LSM_industrierat:0 "Langschwertischer Industrierat"
LSM_industrierat_desc:0 "To ensure that our investment reaches the right claws, we need to cooperate with the wealthy and powerful. For that, we shall establish an Industrial Council which will coordinate the actions of the government and private business in the name of the common good."
LSM_arms_industries:0 "Military-Industrial Complex"
LSM_arms_industries_desc:0 "For future wars and conflicts, Longsword needs a dedicated state-owned military-industrial complex, where we may implement the newest innovation in military technology and production techniques in order to always maintain an edge over our opponents."
LSM_cartelization:0 "Promote Cartelization of Industry"
LSM_cartelization_desc:0 "If two companies compete in the same field and both spend two million bits on marketing their product, that is four million bits which could have been spent on making products for society and yet were wasted. No more! We shall forcefully merge companies to make each sector of the economy controlled by one cartel of producers, and nobody else."
LSM_rural_education:0 "Kirchspiels Schulverwaltung"
LSM_rural_education_desc:0 "It does not matter if the middle classes of Swordsson and Zeltstadt are well-off and educated. Until the entire country learns how to read, we will always lag behind our neighbours. To amend that, we must implement a decentralized system of education and mandate the establishment of grammar schools for every 500 inhabitants."
LSM_fight_poverty:0 "Relief for the Impoverished"
LSM_fight_poverty_desc:0 "The civil war left many destitute, homeless and on the verge of starvation. We cannot leave themm behind - no matter what their race is, they are still Longswordian. To provide for every mouth, we need to establish travelling soup kitchens and construct cheap wooden housing in city outskirts for the homeless."
LSM_railroad_construction:0 "National Infrastructure Commission"
LSM_railroad_construction_desc:0 "The civil war left many roads and rail lines unusable - and even if that were not the case, the infrastructure system in the country has become hopelessly outdated.

### Events ###
longsword.1.t:0 "The National Liberation Committee"
longsword.1.d:0 ""Be welcome, comrades", Starry Night spoke to her fellow revolutionaries in a secluded forest grove. "I'm glad you could all safely make it. I've gathered us today to discuss our plan of action against the increasing Black Cloak threat. Not a day passes that we don't hear about villages being burned, families slaughtered or corpses floating in the river! This has gone on long enough, what will we do about it?" \n\n"We will resist, we will fight, we will bite!", the small crowd intoned. \n\n"Glory, comrades!", Starry continued, "As I speak, our friends in Hellquill and Lake City are moving in to bring us aid! Dusktalon and his cronies will not harm innocent ponies anymore! A new dawn rises, and we will be free!". The partisans cheered and stomped their hooves in response. A glint of hope was seen in each of their eyes, for the first time in a while. They will be prepared for what is to come."
longsword.1.a:0 "Mes niekada nenustosime priešintis!"

longsword.2.t:0 "The Journey Begins"
longsword.2.d:0 ""Is everypony here?", you asked the group of partisans which had gathered near the edge of the forest. Nine voices responded in confirmation. This meant that all of them were here. "Good. Before we leave though, I want to say two things. Firstly, I want to thank all of you for deciding to accompany me in this highly difficult and dangerous mission. Secondly, I would like to remind everypony that while we shouldn't encounter any of the count's soldiers in our path, we should still remain alert as griffons possess far better vision in the dark than any of us. So try not to cause any noise while advancing, we wouldn't want to attract unwanted attention, would we?" You took a deep breath, "Now that all of this is out of the way.""
longsword.2.a:0 "Onto Kupiškis!"

longsword.3.t:0 "The Outskirts of Kupiškis"
longsword.3.d:0 "As the last rays of sunlight fell onto the land you emerged from the forest. Even for experienced partisans, the advance towards Kupiškis wasn't the easiest one. In order to avoid any possible contact with the griffon soldiers loyal to the Count, you had to spend entire days hidden within the most uncomfortable places possible and even cross several highly dangerous swamps, which nearly resulted in several deaths. However this didn't matter anymore, now you had approached Kupiškis, the halfway mark of the mission. From here on the path towards Hellquil should be easier, but that would come tomorrow. Now you and your group need to rest from days and nights of marching and hiding. However this raised the question of shelter. Camping outside isn't ideal and Kupiškis has a substantial pony population living within its walls, maybe some of them would take you in?"
longsword.3.a:0 "I'm certain our fellow ponies shall help us!"
longsword.3.b:0 "We can't afford to risk our mission, we're camping outside."

longsword.4.t:0 "The Path to Beakstadt"
longsword.4.d:0 "You left the flat in which your group spent the night at the break of dawn. As the first rays of the morning sun fell on the still sleeping city you said goodbye to the ponies which took you in last night and began slowly and carefully moving through the streets of Kupiškis. It was far easier to evade the griffon guards than it was the night before, most of them must have been tired from patrolling the streets of the city for the entire night. You and the other partisans, on the other hoof, had a full night rest and thus were able to slip out of the city with relative ease. \n\nKupiškis was the last settlement with any substantial military forces loyal to the Count on their path. Covering the remaining distance to your goal should be simple."
longsword.4.a:0 "We'll go along the riverside towards Beakstadt."

longsword.5.t:0 "The Path to Beakstadt"
longsword.5.d:0 "As the morning sun cast its rays onto the awakening earth you and the other partisans packed up your equipment and items and began moving again. You advanced through the wilderness until it was safe to assume that even the most keen-eyed griffons couldn't see your movement. From here on, your journey should be far safer as Kupiškis was the last urban centre with any substantial presence of griffon military forces in your path. Covering the remaining distance to our goal should be simple."
longsword.5.a:0 "We'll go along the riverside towards Beakstadt."

longsword.6.t:0 "The Guards"
longsword.6.d:0 "Sneaking into Kupiškis wasn't a very difficult task and one which you accomplished with ease. Your current goal was to reach the old town, the part of the city which was inhabited by ponies, and where you knew you could find help. However as you moved through the streets of the sleeping city, you encountered a problem - the griffon guard patrols. While they weren't extremely numerous, they were usually patrolling the main streets. This meant that now you have to spend substantial amounts of time just trying to go around them all. But at least you were making progress.\n\nAs you looked at the walls which separated the old town from the rest of the city, you silently cursed to yourself. There were at least a dozen griffons standing guard near the main gate, which strangely enough was open, and the square in front of it. Three of the patrols were talking to another griffon who and from what you could hear and understand, was trying to convince the guard to allow him to go through the gate. Of course the guard didn't want to let the other griffon through, constantly repeating that as enforcers of the law, they aren't allowed to go back on their orders and allow anyone through. You know, however, that this is probably a huge lie. Most griffon officials were corrupt to the core. Though it might be risky, you could try bribing your way through the gate. Although the patrols do seem to be focused on the trespassing griffon."
longsword.6.a:0 "Gentlegriffs, perhaps a hundred Idols would make you change your mind?"
longsword.6.b:0 "We'll sneak past them."

longsword.7.t:0 "The Contacts"
longsword.7.d:0 "As you lie down on an actual bed for the first time in several years and feel all the stress leaving your body, you decide that despite all the risks that your group had taken while sneaking into Kupiškis, it was all worth it. However as you looked at your comrades, you notice that they aren't really sharing the mood. They are clearly nervous and seem to expect that griffon guards are going to break into the flat at any moment. Most of them are still clinging on their weapons and glancing at the windows and the door into the room every few seconds. \n\nYou sigh to yourself. What was even the point of getting here, if none of you will be able to get any rest?"
longsword.7.a:0 "Take a break, ponies, we've a long day ahead of us tomorrow."

longsword.8.t:0 "The Fight"
longsword.8.d:0 "One of the griffons raised his rifle and aimed it at you. "You are under arrest for being outside on curfew hours and trying to bribe a guard." \n\nWell, this was an outcome that you couldn't have expected. What were even the chances that you would encounter an incorrupt griffon guard in Kupiškis at this point in time? Quite slim, you imagined. But maybe the guard was corrupt and was just trying to get more out of you?\n\n"How about two hundred gold crowns?"\n\n"You dare to mock me?!" The griffon gnarled at you, before trying to strike you with his rifle.\n\nThe griffon collapsed on the ground, blood spilling from a hole in the place where one of his eyes used to be. You turned your head slightly to see one of the partisans belonging to your group aiming his weapon at another of the guards. It looks like trying to get through without killing everyone wouldn't be an option anymore."
longsword.8.a:0 "Ponies, attack!"

longsword.9.t:0 "A Hasty Exit"
longsword.9.d:0 "There were more griffon guards than partisans, but you had the element of surprise on your side and somehow managed to overwhelm the guards and kill them all. Of course, your group didn't emerge out of the firefight completely without harm, with a few suffering minor wounds from bullets scrapping their bodies while one of the partisans was shot in their right front leg. You patched her wound up in the best way you could afford with the limited time you had. While others suggested to only help her after reaching safety, you decided that you wouldn't risk the guards finding you due to the mare's blood. Only after you were sure that there wasn't a way that the griffons could track your group, you ordered them to run. \n\nWhile you couldn't spend much time in Kupiškis, it was enough to get some proper sleep, some good food and to bandage the wounds that the other partisans suffered properly. Now they wouldn't fall off and yesterday's situation wouldn't repeat again, hopefully.\n\nAs the group was about to leave, you turned to the owners of the apartment. \n\n"Thank you for taking us in." You looked around the room one last time before leaving."
longsword.9.a:0 "Sorry for getting bloodstains on the carpet."

longsword.10.t:0 "An Unfortunate Series of Events"
longsword.10.d:0 "The element of surprise was on the side of the partisans while the griffon guard was spread out in the open. But they had the greater numbers, and it seems that this was enough. Your comrades were dying all around you, pierced by the griffon bullets. You weren't in the best position yourself either, blood was oozing from several bullet scrapes all across your body. Trying to retreat wasn't an option, at least not anymore, griffons surrounded the alley where the last living members of the partisans were standing their ground. \n\nA sharp pain pierced your chest as you fell backwards from an impact, collapsing onto the pavement. You tried to get up, only to slip on something and fall again. Breathing was becoming harder and your muscles seemed to be weaker than before. You tried standing up yet again, and this time you somehow manage, only to notice a massive puddle of red liquid under you."
longsword.10.a:0 "Is... is... that... my blood?"

longsword.11.t:0 "Dead in a Flash"
longsword.11.d:0 ""Stop right there", you heard one of the griffon guards scream as you left the shadowy alley from which you were observing the situation at the gate. You turned towards the patrols who were now aiming their rifles at you. \n\n"Gentelgriffs, how could I help you?" You ask, trying to force out a smile.\n\n"What are you doing outside on curfew hours?" One of the Griffons questioned. \n\n"Well I was just returning to..." You couldn't finish your sentence before one of the guards began screaming. \n\n"The pony is armed!" Screamed out one of the guards. \n\nThe last thing you saw before the griffon bullets pierced your skull were your comrades jumping out of the shadows and opening fire in an attempt to save you."
longsword.11.a:0 "Horseapples."

longsword.12.t:0 "The Guards in the Forest"
longsword.12.d:0 "You thought that camping in the forest and not entering Kupiškis would mean that there wouldn't be any griffon patrols and guards that you would need to avoid to remain safe. However, as the griffon guard patrol stopped right next to the grove where you planned to set up your camp, you decided that you should move further from the city and deeper into the forest in order to avoid any chance of encountering griffons again. Of course this would mean that you would have to spend some time getting back on the path tomorrow, but not getting shot while you are asleep is worth those few minutes. Though, of course, to move deeper in the forest, you have to get past the patrol."
longsword.12.a:0 "To battle!"
longsword.12.b:0 "We shall sneak past them..."

longsword.13.t:0 "A Sad End"
longsword.13.d:0 "You laid on the ground, unable to move your legs properly anymore, blood and tears streaming down your cheeks. You had doomed not only yourself, but also the other partisans and your mission. In your idiocy you decided to engage the griffon guard in close combat. You overestimated your capabilities and the mutilation of your body was the price you had to pay. Your remaining eye was barely able to focus on anything anymore, but you could still see the few remaining ponies trying to retreat from the onslaught of the griffon guard. For a moment you still held hope that maybe some of them could finish the mission, but as one of them fired his weapon, you realized that they didn't have a chance anymore, as other patrolling guards would be here very soon."
longsword.13.a:0 "Starry Night, we've failed..."

longsword.14.t:0 "The Battle in the Forest"
longsword.14.d:0 "While you had a long experience of sneaking and hiding within the forests of your motherland it seems that some members of your group weren't as skilled. They have experience of hiding within the forests of your motherland of course, but they are still causing some noise. Though it doesn't seem that the guards are noticing your movement, so maybe if you move a bit faster... \n\nYour blood freezes as you hear the hoof of one of the partisans breaking a branch. \n\n"There are partisans in the bushes!", screamed out one of the griffons and aimed his rifle in your direction."
longsword.14.a:0 "To battle!"

longsword.15.t:0 "Victory!"
longsword.15.d:0 "If the griffons would have had similar numbers to your group, attempting to engage them in close combat would have been suicidal. But you had the numbers and the patrol didn't expect such a bold assault. Their moment of confusion allowed your group to close the distance and engage in close combat. Usually you would simply open fire, but there was a chance that other griffon guard patrols were nearby, and thus you couldn't allow a single bullet to be shot in this fight. And somehow your group managed to achieve it. The fight that followed was quite grotesque as the only way the ponies had of executing griffons was stomping on them until they finished moving, but this didn't matter, you had won, and without any casualties at that and you secured your way deeper into the forest."
longsword.15.a:0 "Hurry, we don't have much time before the bodies are found!"

longsword.16.t:0 "A Quiet Approach"
longsword.16.d:0 "While you had a long experience of sneaking and hiding within the forests of your motherland it seems that some members of your group weren't as skilled. They have experience of hiding within the forests of your motherland of course, but they are still causing some noise. Though it doesn't seem that the guards are noticing your movement, you decide to slow down a bit. As you begin to move slower and think more about where you place your next step, it seems that your comrades began mimicking you, as the amount of noise they were causing lessened. \n\n"Why are we slowing down?" The mare who was directly behind you whispered. "Shouldn't we try to move through as swiftly as possible?""
longsword.16.a:0 "Quiet, now, we mustn't be found..."

longsword.17.t:0 "A Meeting in a Beakstadt Flat"
longsword.17.d:0 ""You actually managed to come all the way here?!", the pony asked your group, clearly surprised by your arrival. "I had hopes, but I never thought that it could be achieved! Come now, the others are waiting." \n\nThe owner of the apartment led you to what was presumably the biggest room inside his property, which was filled to the brim with ponies. \n\n"Can I have all of your attentions please?", the owner addressed the gathering within the chamber. While it took some time, the chitchat and discussions ended, allowing the unicorn to continue his speech. "Today we have a group of very important guests here, a group of partisans from Longsword." \n\nThe owner of the flat invited you to take his place as he moved to the side and stood next to the other local ponies. While you were hesitant as you weren't that good at speeches, you took the place where he stood and addressed those who had gathered here. \n\n"As most of you probably know, the current Count of our country is the mad leader of the Longswordian Reformisten - Dusktalon. For years this insane griffon has been trying to exterminate us and our culture, to wipe it off the face of Griffonia. We resisted this lunatic and his cronies for these long and blood filled years, and finally we are seemingly approaching victory. But we can't do this alone. And this is why the leader of our movement has sent us here, to request help from you, our brothers and sisters within Hellquil. So I ask you, will you help us?" \n\nEvery single creature within the room raised one of their frontal legs into the air. Confused by this you turned your head towards the owner, who smiled and stated. \n\n"The ponies of Hellquill will help you in the upcoming struggle.""
longsword.17.a:0 "Resist and bite! Take up arms and fight!"

longsword.18.t:0 "The Spread of Revolutionary Literature"
longsword.18.d:0 "The anti-regime posters were absolutely everywhere. No matter where in the city you went, there wasn't a single street which was devoid of pro-partisan propaganda.\n\nMost of them depicted red clad ponies and griffons "fighting" against avian creatures dressed in dark clothes, the beaks and claws of the creatures were painted red, probably to indicate that they were "covered in blood". Below and above such illustrations were revolutionary slogans and sometimes lists of "crimes" committed by the Count and the Black Cloaks. The posters demanded the populace to join a "just" cause and help in overthrowing the "tyrant of Longsword" so that both griffons and ponies could be "freed from their shackles"."
longsword.18.a:0 "What a bunch of nonsense..."

longsword.19.t:0 "Sending a Message"
longsword.19.d:0 ""Comrades!", Starry Night proclaimed to the ponies and griffons gathered in the forest grove, "The time has come for us to show that our movement is more than simple revolutionary slogans! To show what happens to those who support the tyrant Count and his cronies!" The partisans of both races cheered in response. "We fought against the Black Cloaks and the crusaders in the forests of our homelands for decades, far away from the major cities. This gave the enemy the impression that we are weak, that there would be no repercussion if they chose to support the destruction of the ponykind. The time has come for us to destroy such delusional fantasies!" The cheering of the partisans increased in volume and intensity with every sentence their leader spoke. "We will hunt them down in their cities and strongholds and show everyone what happens to those who choose to align themselves with the tyrants and oppressors!" The cheering turned into something that could be described as roaring. "Who will be our targets, comrade?", one of the revolutionaries asked as the ponies and griffons calmed down."
longsword.19.a:0 "Target only the worst offenders."
longsword.19.b:0 "Anybody that collaborated is an enemy!"

longsword.20.t:0 "A Firm Message"
longsword.20.d:0 "For most griffons, this morning was identical to any other. They woke up from slumber, performed their routines and left their living quarters in order to go to their workplaces, only to lay their eyes on a horrifying sight. Hundreds of griffon bodies were covering the streets and squares of the Longswordian cities. Black Cloaks, knights, military commanders and administrators known for their close connections with the Count, killed by a single cut. On the chest of every slain griffon was one of the symbols related to the partisans and a single word in the language of native ponies - "Revenge". The message from the revolutionaries towards the griffons of Longsword was clear. They had hunted and killed ponies for centuries, and now they would suffer the same fate."

They woke up from slumber, performed their routines and left their living quarters in order to go to their workplaces, only to lay their eyes a horrifying sight. Thousands of griffon bodies were covering the streets and squares of Longswordian cities. Black Cloaks, knights, soldiers were butchered grotesquely. But they weren't the only ones who suffered such gruesome fate. All who had even a remote connection with these groups were treated the same. Family members, friends, even those who worked and owned businesses that the Black Cloaks and knights were known to visit, all were slain in the same manner as the most fanatical supporters of the Count's genocidal policies. There was seemingly no single way of execution, as each victim was brutalized differently and to various extents. While some were simply shot, others were unrecognisable. All the victims shared one similarity, however. In every place where at least one body was located, there would always be a symbol drawn on the closest building, and the symbols would always be connected to one of the partisan groups. The message from the revolutionaries towards the griffons of Longsword was clear. They butchered the ponies for centuries, and now they would suffer the same fate."

longsword.22.t:0 "Unexpected Side Effects"
longsword.22.d:0 ""Comrades.", Starry Night addressed the two ponies that had entered her bunker. "Why did you want to see me?" \n\n"Comrade, I believe that our campaign to indiscriminately target the collaborators was a great mistake.", Vycolt, the leader of revolutionary forces in the "Great Struggle" district, stated. "It seems that our terror didn't result in the Count and the Black Cloaks losing support from the population. Rather, we seem to have turned them against us." \n\n"A substantial percentage of the population of the country, even other ponies, don't see us as liberators or freedom fighters anymore. They see us as bloodthirsty butchers.", Arklid, the second in command of "Varėnė" district continued where Vycolt stopped. "The population now either thinks that the Count's policies are justified, or that we are just a reflection of the Count and his Black Cloaks, just a genocidal group of lunatics with too much influence and support. In fact, already, some of our biggest supporters have cut ties with us due to our actions that night and diverted their help towards other groups which oppose Dusktalon and his cronies. If such a trend continues, I fear that our enemies might gather substantial support from the pony population which opposes us due to our actions.""

longsword.23.t:0 "Preparing Our Troops"
longsword.23.d:0 "This was the first time since the establishment of the Partisan movement that the entire leadership had gathered in a single bunker. Previously such a meeting would be considered too dangerous, as it would allow their enemies to extinguish the flame of liberty if the location was ever found out. But what was being discussed today was important enough to risk it all. After all, today they were beginning the preparations for the uprising. \n\n"Comrades.", Abba Povner, one of the most important figures in the movement, addressed the revolutionaries who had gathered in the bunker. "For generations we fought the Count and his Black Cloaks in the forests and swamps of our homeland and achieved some truly great victories. However, we cannot defeat the tyrant Dusktalon and his cronies like this. To achieve our independence we will have to engage our enemies in the open. And our forces simply aren't ready for such a military campaign. After long discussions and arguments between the most capable leaders of our movement it has been decided that with resources that are available to us now or will be available in near future there are two possible ways to prepare our forces for the uprising. We can either attempt to increase our numbers or improve the martial prowess and accuracy of our fighters." Abba turned towards the leader of the revolutionaries. "Comrade Starry, I believe this decision is yours to make.""
longsword.23.a:0 "Amp up the recruitment, we'll need the extra bodies."
longsword.23.b:0 "I want everypony improving their skills, every day of the week!"

longsword.24.t:0 "Acquiring the Guns"
longsword.24.d:0 ""Comrade Starry.", Zhmud greeted the revolutionary leader who had just entered the underground complex. \n\n"This is unusual of you Zhmud, usually you don't need my approval for raids." \n\n"You are indeed correct, Comrade. However, with the numbers of weapons we have been ordered to provide this time, I don't think I have the necessary experience to choose the target myself." \n\n"Two possible locations have been chosen, am I correct?" Starry Night asked the unicorn, satisfied with the explanation. \n\n"Indeed. There are only two possible ways how we can acquire all the equipment that the movement needs in one swift move. We can attempt to use the substantial amount of supporters and fighters of our movement in Haarsingen to steal the necessary equipment from the main weapons storage of the city. The other option is to try attacking the vehicles that are transporting weaponry to Zeltstadt. Either of these would require massive concentrations of resources, and thus I believe that you should be the one choosing which action we should take. Comrade Starry, from where we should get our equipment?""
longsword.24.a:0 "Our agents in Haarsingen shall secure the weapons."
longsword.24.b:0 "We shall intercept the arms shipment heading towards Zeltstadt."

longsword.25.t:0 "The Secret Government"
longsword.25.d:0 ""Will this be enough for your needs?", the griffon asked. \n\n"I do believe so." Starry Night responded, looking at the plans and depictions of a building complex which were displayed on the wooden table in the middle of the bunker. "It is located within the city itself?" \n\n"Indeed, the manor and its surroundings, while not originally built within the borders of the city, are currently located in one of the districts within Visaginas. This unique history means that the complex is surrounded by a substantial amount of parks and gardens and even fortified walls, which means that nobody who isn't part of the movement should notice any changes." \n\n"Then I do believe that this will be more than enough. Please tell Gottard that the revolutionary army is grateful for his help in the great struggle against tyranny." \n\n"I believe Lord Tyzenhauzen will be glad to hear this. May Arcturius help you in your struggle." \n\nAs the griffon was leaving, Starry Night looked through the documents laying on the table and smiled. This was simply perfect. Now they not only had a proper base of operations within Visaginas, the administrative and military centre of Southern Longsword, but also an estate big enough to house one of the ideas that the revolutionary leader wished to put into action for some time - establishing a preliminary government. This was the culmination of the reorganization of the movement. They were no longer groups of guerrillas hiding in the forests, they were an army. And no longer would they be revolutionaries who hid in the forests dreaming of a free Ilgakardija, they would be its leaders."
longsword.25.a:0 "We are almost ready..."

longsword.26.t:0 "Lockdown in Panacea"
longsword.26.d:0 ""Leader Starry.", Sofia von Tyzenhauzen greeted her leader as she entered into the room which served Starry Night's cabinet. \n\n"Comrade Sofia", the unicorn responded, "Did something important happen for you to come back from your trip so early?" \n\n"Indeed. It seems that there have been some interesting developments in the northwest of the country. There seems to be a massive increase of military personnel in the region of Panacea and especially within Zeltstadt. This by itself wouldn't be such a surprise with the increased activities of your movement, but on one of the mornings in the city I heard quite the unexpected radio broadcast. It was by Field Marshal Conrad Silvertalon. While speaking on the radio he claimed that he and the military want to depose Dusktalon and punish him for the crimes he has committed and asked for any griffon and pony who wishes to end tyranny to join him.""
longsword.26.a:0 "It seems we have a competing rebellion."

longsword.27.t:0 "Acts of Sabotage"
longsword.27.d:0 ""Come in." \n\n"Comrades.", the partisan greeted Vycolt and Arklid as he entered the basement room of a collapsed house. "We have received an order from Comrade Starry Night." The fighter walked to the leader of "The Great Struggle" district and gave him a piece of folded paper. Then the guerrilla turned around and left the chamber. Vycolt unfolded the note and began reading. \n\n"Comrade Vycolt, I believe that in order to ensure our success in the final struggle, we must further reduce the amount of experienced personnel and productive facilities available for the Count. Therefore, I ask you to intensify your efforts in harassing the Reformisten and their allies." \n\n"What are the orders?" Arklid, the leader of the "Varėnė" district, asked. \n\n"We have been ordered to increase our activities against the Count." \n\n"I don't think we have the necessary resources to really increase our activity. What could we even do?""
longsword.27.a:0 "If a few officers were to disappear, all the better."
longsword.27.b:0 "A bomb or two ought to teach them a lesson."

longsword.28.t:0 "The Battle at Varėna"
longsword.28.d:0 "As the bullet connected with the target, the now dead griffon collapsed to the ground, his blood joining with the sacred earth. Abba smiled to himself, he couldn't stop himself from experiencing satisfaction while killing the count's servants, especially under the current circumstances. The arrogant tyrants that occupied their motherland had made a grave mistake this time. They dared to not only enslave the ponies, but desecrate Varėna, the holy city of the Goddess Varėnė. Such arrogance and malevolence would not be allowed to continue! Abba aimed his rifle at another griffon and pulled the trigger. He had promised that for every injustice that ponies suffered, the count's loyalists would suffer tenfold, and he was going to keep that promise. \n\nAbba gazed across his surroundings. The Black Cloaks, now greatly reduced, fled the city and its surroundings. Thousands of ponies were freed from their shackles. Truly, this was a... Abba was snapped out of his thoughts by the clacking of armour to his side. He turned his head to see Ludwig sitting down next to him. "Today was truly a great victory!" The griffon knight proclaimed in native Longswordian with a thick imperial accent."
longsword.28.a:0 "We sent those Black Cloaks running for the river!"

longsword.29.t:0 "The Visaginas Uprising"
longsword.29.d:0 "The preparations had taken Starry Night and the partisans many years. They gathered supporters across the nation, both pony and griffon, both noble and commoner. They expanded their forces greatly, training thousands and equipping them with the best weaponry available. They gathered supporters and allies abroad. They eliminated most of the capable Reformisten leadership. They destroyed the Count's supporters in the battle of Varėna. And now, it was time.\n\nAcross Southern Ilgakardija the partisans left their hiding places in the vast forests and remote villages and began their onslaught. They marched upon the settlements that were still in control of Black Cloaks or their allies, slaying the Count's loyalists wherever they were found. Soldiers, previously thought loyal would turn against their former compatriots, gunning them down while chanting the slogans of the resistance. Within the fortresses which were erected in the days of Grover I, Partisan aligned knights engaged the ones who devoted themselves to the Count's cause with blades and guns and slew them. \n\nIn Visaginas, the administrative and military capital of the region fell in but a few hours as a massive contingent of Partisan fighters, under the leadership of Starry Night cleansed the city of any remaining Reformisten or their supporters, leaving the city in revolutionary hooves. With this, the preliminary government swiftly took over the leadership positions that were left empty with the execution of members of the previous governing body of the region. \n\nIn a single day, an entire third of the country fell under the control of the Partisans and their countless allies. But the great struggle didn't end yet, it had only begun."
longsword.29.a:0 "Už Laisvę!"

longsword.30.t:0 "Stolen Equipment"
longsword.30.d:0 "While we first dismissed the partisan attacks upon our weapon convoys as something that couldn't really affect us, time has proven us wrong. It seems that the partisans have in fact seized a far greater amount of equipment than we thought. We believed that they could have taken 500 rifles at most, however now when we are finally able to properly check just how many weapons we have actually lost, it seems that we have underestimated our enemy as the new reports indicate that the partisans have taken twice as many weapons!"
longsword.30.a:0 "Damn it!"

longsword.31.t:0 "The Civil War Ends"
longsword.31.d:0 "For all their boasting of griffon superiority, the Reformisten are terrible fighters. We have struck Swordsson at the break of dawn, and the majority of their forces quickly fled before our advance, cowards as they are. Fearful of our retribution, Dusktalon and his cronies have tried to flee across the river to Hellquill. Unfortunately, while most of his high ranking subordinates have gotten away, we have managed to shoot the despotic Count! His body was dragged back to Swordsson, where it was strung up a noose in the now abandoned execution square. The vengeful Partisans cheered at the display of irony, pelting the body with rocks, manure and spoiled produce, as a form of sick and twisted target practice. \n\nAcross the country, the last of the military rebellion have laid down their arms now that we've taken the fortified city of Zeltstadt. No retribution was taken against these honourable griffons, and they were allowed to peacefully leave the country, although we've tried to convince them to stay and help in reconstructing Longsword.\n\nThe victorious Partisans now face a difficult task of rebuilding Longsword in their ideal, calming the tensions between griffons and ponies, and preparing for any foreign incursions. Yet with their brilliant and fearless leader, Starry Night, the ponies feel confident in a bright future, free of hatred and tyranny."
longsword.31.a:0 "Victory!"

longsword.32.t:0 "A New Capital"
longsword.32.d1:0 ""How come we did not just name all of it Ilgakardija?" was the response of Arklidas, who chose to offer his thoughts on the new announcement. [Root.GetLeader] knew the answer to it already.\n\n"It's more than just Ilgakardija now, is it? Our brothers and sisters to the north of Griffking, they no longer speak our language, even our customs are different. And Longsword itself is more than just Longswordian, so... it makes sense for us to adopt a name which all of us may proudly call theirs."\n\nWhat was once Longsword and Hellquill have received the news that they shall forever stay as one Vartai Republic - a state for Ponies, Griffons and Posniaks, with the rights and freedoms of all of the cultures respected under a federal structure. This new state needs a capital, however, and its engorged size means that Visaginas is not likely to cut it anymore. Two proposals have been drafted already - one would relocate the government to Swordsson, still in Longswordian territory, but close to Hellquill and next to the Santaka Central Industrial Region, while the other would place it in the city of Hellquill, the largest town in Vartai. In either of these cases, the old, Ost-Griffonian name of the town will be abandoned and replaced with "Unity" - "Vienybė". Alternatively, it might still be possible to keep it in Visaginas..."
longsword.32.d2:0 "With a brilliant stroke, the armies of the Longswordian republic stormed across the Griffking River, destroying the Knightly Order, and so the last remnants of the Crusades with it. An engorged Longsword now stands upon the frontier between East and West, the only thing separating Herzland and the Riverlands. It may have a joint local name - Vartai - but the Vadeiva has dismissed the option. After all, their ambition should rest much, much farther than the forests and marches of their homeland.\n\nVartai is but the heart of a sleeping national body which encompasses all of Griffonia - and should that not be the name of their state, then? The Heart..."
longsword.32.a:0 "Where else should it go but Swordsson?"
longsword.32.b:0 "Hellquill, the largest city in Vartai."
longsword.32.c:0 "The capital shall stay in Visaginas, where Longsword began."
longsword.32.e:0 "The first step has been taken."

longsword.33.t:0 "Teaching the People"
longsword.33.d:0 "For the longest time, the system of education in Ilgakardija was abysmal. There were close to no schools, or any institutions of education really. And what few schools existed were in a horrible shape and lacked funding. Our ministry of education had to start from scratch. And with dedication from ponies and griffons working in the institution, we are seemingly moving forwards. The old schools are being renovated and new ones are being built monthly. The old curriculum has been discarded completely, replaced by a new one which consists of courses which are deemed necessary to create an educated and capable society, which includes basic literacy, history and basic military training, among various other subjects.\n\nOf course, it will take a substantial amount of time before this reform is completed, but it already seems that we are slowly reaching positive results."
longsword.33.a:0 "A literate society is a free society!"

longsword.34.t:0 "Teaching the People"
longsword.34.d:0 "Compared to how it was just a short time ago, the educational situation within Ilgakardija is completely different. Previously, it was a country plagued by illiteracy, its leaders obsessed with delusions of grandeur rather than actually caring for the citizens. However, with the efforts of our ministry of education this has changed. New schools have been built, new, professional teachers have been trained, an improved curriculum has been implemented and tens of thousands of books have been printed. And this has great results as literacy rates are rising at an astonishing rate. Of course, it will still take us years if not decades to reach complete literacy. However the percentage of literate ponies and griffons is now great enough that we aren't suffering from the previously crippling effects of illiteracy."
longsword.34.a:0 "A literate society is a free society!"

longsword.35.t:0 "The Issue of Hellquill"
longsword.35.d:0 "While it has been agreed by many of the members of our government that [HLQ.GetName] and our state should become one, there have been arguments over how such a union should be achieved. Some suggest that we should try to achieve the union of our countries diplomatically. They argue that a country built on war and destruction would be extremely unstable and prone to internal conflicts. They are opposed by the more militant groups within our government who claim that not only would simply invading and conquering Hellquil be a far quicker solution, it would also justify us being the leaders of the newly formed state. "
longsword.35.a:0 "Diplomacy is the answer. Send an envoy."
longsword.35.b:0 "Only war shall solve this issue!"

longsword.36.t:0 "An Offer From Longsword"
longsword.36.d:0 "After the County of Longsword collapsed into the civil war and the rebels emerged victorious we were preparing for a full on invasion from the south. However, we didn't expect that the new state of Longsword would send diplomats rather than soldiers. Instead of invading us they requested that we join their state peacefully. They assure us that if we join them, we will be given a substantial amount of autonomy and will not be charged for any real or proclaimed crimes. However the diplomats never stated what will happen if we decide against this proposal."
longsword.36.a:0 "We shall accept."
longsword.36.b:0 "We respectfully decline."

longsword.37.t:0 "The Hellquillians Accept"
longsword.37.d:0 "Our diplomats returned with truly great news. The leadership of Hellquill, after quite a few debates and some time of consideration, has decided to accept our offer and join our nation peacefully. Of course it will take a long time to properly integrate these new territories into our nation properly. However this is still a great day worth celebrating."
longsword.37.a:0 "Welcome!"

longsword.38.t:0 "The Hellquillians Decline"
longsword.38.d:0 "Our diplomats have returned with extremely disappointing news. The leaders of Hellquill, despite our arguments and promises of peace and autonomy, have decided against our proposal of peaceful unification. This ignited a new argument between the members of our government. Some of them still believe in diplomatic resolution and thus think that we should accept this diplomatic defeat. Most, however, think that Hellquil must become part of our state, now."
longsword.38.a:0 "We must respect their decision."

longsword.40.t:0 "Dealing With the Impoverished"
longsword.40.d:0 "While under the control of the tyrant count Dusktalon, our country was in an extremely horrible position, with most of the population being stricken with poverty. However, with investments and programs from the new leadership, this situation is changing. With the countless new government created homeless shelters and other similar institutions to help those who are unable to provide for themselves and employ those who lack any source of income, it seems that we are slowly moving towards a better era."
longsword.40.a:0 "Soup kitchen is that way, Comrade."

longsword.41.t:0 "The Wealth of a Nation"
longsword.41.d:0 ""I still can't believe we came this far." Arklidas told Golden Spark with a smile.\n\n"You doubted the capabilities of our movement?"\n\n"To be honest, I did. Sometimes I find myself thinking that this must be just a dream. I simply can't believe that this is reality."\n\n"Really? Are all our accomplishments that impossibly fantastical for you?"\n\n"Do you? Just look upon this city. Barely a few years ago its streets were filled with homeless and criminals. Ponies and griffons starved to death in the alleys. The signs of poverty could be seen everywhere... But now? The streets are clean and pristine, filled with happy members of both races. Underemployed is at all-time low. Poverty is almost gone. It just seems unbelievable... I got so used to the sights of cities within Ilgakardija before our victory that I could only remember them as filled with suffering. But now...""
longsword.41.a:0 "Now everyone is happy!"

longsword.42.t:0 "One Last Argument"
longsword.42.d:0 "Conrad Silvertalon stood silently in the count's office. \n\n"And this is why, Silvertalon, we shall not rest until every last pony is removed from Longsword. They are the corruption destroying us from within," Count Dusktalon droned on and on, "I need you to make our dream a reality." Silvertalon, realising his efforts were in vain, gave a quick salute and left the room. The Count was worse than a brick wall! Nothing he said got to him! \n\nAs he was leaving the Count's residence, flanked by the Reformisten guards, he heard a pony screaming. Silvertalon closed his eyes and sighed. He had no real love for the ponies, but it was obvious slaughtering them senselessly would cause an even bigger disaster later on! \n\nIt was time to stop this madness. And he knew that he would not be alone. Throughout the past few weeks, he had been corresponding with an ally in Zeltstadt - the Rosewood Order. Hochmeisterin Konrada and the honorable knights who had fought alongside Grover in the crusade to the East, they saw no need for this bloodshed.\n\nTogether, they would have to return and topple the Count. For honor. For fidelity. For Longsword."
longsword.42.a:0 "Enough is enough!"

longsword.43.t:0 "Reconsidering Our Orders"
longsword.43.d:0 "The Hochmeisterin, Konrada Wavewing, looked at the envelope containing the latest orders, marked with the Count's personal seal. She quickly examined them and grimaced. The Count wanted to move a chapter of the Rosewood Order to the Visaginas countryside, to assist in the massacre. From what she heard of her fellow conspirator, Conrad Silvertalon, the Army was being pressured to lend their support as well.\n\nThis simply would not stand. Having thrown the letter to the fireplace, she set forth on writing her own, more beneficial orders. The Rosewood Order would be moving a slight few pieces to...create some alterations in the schedule. A few slight nudges here and there could go a long way towards making sure that the Count's plans would go slighty awry and go into a tailspin."

longsword.44.d:0 "Unfortunately, our recent redeployment orders for our troops have caught on with the Partisans, and they've began a series of raids now that the units previously guarding vulnerable areas have been repositioned. Count Dusktalon will undoubtedly be furious, but our more pressing concern is how this affects our future plans..."

longsword.45.t:0 "The Reformisten in the Army"
longsword.45.d:0 "Many of the high positions in the Longswordian army have been occupied by Dusktalon's Reformisten goons, and their effect is starting to show. They're nothing but cruel taskmasters, disregarding their responsibilities, murdering innocent civilians and stealing their subordinates' pay checks. \n\nGeneral Silvertalon and his conspirators have been investigating them and has been coming up with plans to get Dusktalon's sycophants safely out of the way before they can cause too much trouble for the conspiracy. Either quietly kill them and dispose of the bodies somewhere discreetly, or, alternatively, send them on a very special mission to Visaginas and other pony-majority areas where the partisans would probably be more than happy to take quite a lot of potshots at them, solving two problems at once."

The complete incompetence of the officers has led to a massive rout, with many wounded griffons returning to Swordsson. Count Dusktalon was furious and will undoubtedly sack the griffons responsible for this failure. \n\nFor all Dusktalon knows, the Army has been nothing but loyal and has evaded the blame for sending the soldiers to Varėna, which has had a good bouquet opened amongst the senior members of the Order to toast to their victory. The Reformisten's defeat has further Silvertalon's plans."

longsword.47.d:0 "We've received reports from the military units in Varėna. \n\nAfter days of vicious and brutal claw-to-hoof door-to-door combat, the Reformisten forces have retaken Varėna from the ponies. Although both sides have taken heavy casualties, and isolated city sections are still occupied by the Partisans, this is a clear victory for the Reformisten. Count Dusktalon has issued minor rewards to the surviving officers for their courage and bravery and is expected to visit their quarters back in Swordsson personally in a few days. \n\nThe Rosewood Order and General Silvertalon have both begrudgingly expressed praise for the victorious griffons and their valour at arms against the enemies of the state."
longsword.47.a:0 "A loss for both sides."

longsword.48.t:0 "An Outstanding Victory!"
longsword.48.d:0 "It is everywhere! Every newspaper and radio broadcast are talking about it! \n\nOur attempt to send the Reformisten to a suicide mission in Varėna has spectacularly backfired, as they have retaken the city in a surprise night attack from the unprepared ponies. They were forced to give up quickly and flee into the forests, and now the Reformisten flag proudly flies from the town hall's spire. Count Dusktalon has promoted the leading commander of the mission with decorations and medals and hass called him and his unit "Heroes of Longsword". The Prelate has ordered a day of celebration in force of this victory \n\nPrivately, the Rosewood Order and General Silvertalon have been fuming behind the scenes, the gamble on sending them away failing miserably.

longsword.49.d:0 "An extensive fortification effort has begun in the cities of Zeltstadt and Kupiškis with large-scale involvement of the knights of the Rosewood Order. The official reasoning by the military and the government was "to protect the Order's castles from the partisan danger", but the civilians are somewhat doubtful of the truthfulness in this claim. Nonetheless, they welcomed the added degree of protection, including bunkers and hidden defences ready to be deployed at a moment's notice. \n\nOf course, the loyalists have been fully aware of the purpose of these defences... If we can't take Longsword from Dusktalon, we'll outlast him until he has starved to death."

Unfortunately, if we were to take everything, this would undoubtedly alarm the Reformisten to a conspiracy and that someone would is moving against them in places unseen. \n\nAfter deliberations within the order, it has been decided that the loss of half of the shipment would be attributed to a partisan raid on one of the few rail lines - but which half shall we take for ourselves?"

The normally incompetent Count, however, has recently delegated the factory supervision to his frightening and capable second-in-command, Rosa Heidenreich. She is...something else entirely and won't be so easily fooled. Perhaps, if Silvertalon and Wavewing's conspiracy pays her a visit in person and explains a few things about Dusktalon, she will see the light and work with us in the future."

The Count is an illegitimate ruler who has no love for the people, nor does he care about Longsword. He has committed crimes that disgust every good griffon, no matter creed or origin! We invite every willing griffon and pony to join us in Zeltstadt, so we can restore true values to Longsword!" \n\nThe message spread throughout Longsword, and has sent ripples through the country.

This is an obstruction to our plan of restoring the proper Longswordian nation, but the Hochmeisterin has been optimistic and ensured General Silvertalon that the Order can handle fighting a war on two fronts if we adequately prepare..."

However, it was quickly realized that all these griffons were connected to the hateful Reformisten, whether they were full members or voluntary collaborators. The common griffons and ponies did not intervene as they watched this vigilante justice sporadically continue to be meted out for the rest of the day. \n\nSurprisingly, the Count hasn't issued a reprisal or action against this open rebellion. Perhaps he was fearful of what goes bump in the night. Or day. The Rosewood Order's reach is vast, and has only grown larger in recent weeks."

While everygriff is of the opinion to divert some of our resources and soldiers into harassing the partisans, there is no clear consensus on where we should strike to take the initiative once the real fighting breaks out. Should we order our soldiers to raid towns and villages known to be hotbeds for partisan activity to hamper their recruitment once the inevitable confrontation happens, or send saboteurs to their camps containing their precious stockpiles of weapons and explosives?"

The madgriff of Longsword hides in his city, fearful of our retribution. For too long has this unwarranted butchery been allowed to continue. But we say no! We will go against him and restore honor and dignity to Longsword today and tomorrow!

After a hard and brutal fight, the civil war for Longsword has been finally concluded in their favour. The Reformisten did not go down easily, as they used some truly despicable tactics, such as arming innocent griffon civilians and pretending to surrender numerous times. The mad Count himself was found barricaded in his residence, and was dragged out to the streets after a short struggle. He was summarily executed by the firing squad, screaming insults and curses as his last words. \n\nMeanwhile in the countryside, the remaining Partisans have agreed to peacefully surrender in exchange for amnesty. Their request was granted as they were fighting for their very existence - a just and noble endeavour, but now they've seen that they cannot bring their idea of change to Longsword after our victory. It will take a while to repair relations between griffons and ponies, following the years of sustained violence against the innocent ponies. \n\nSilvertalon addressed his griffons and ponies, telling them how proud he was of their courage in standing to up the cruel Reformisten, and finished by saying that our victory marks the beginning of a new age for a honourable Longsword, defender of the griffon way of life. Wavewing's address afterwards was a lot more brief, a statement of only a few words that they can all be proud of their achievement."

But the world stops for nobody, and to best protect the Empire, we must adapt. An updated curriculum consisting of basic literacy skills, physical education, and our great Empire's politics and history has been designed and distributed to the few schools dotted around nation, with new schools being built by the month. \nThough progress has been almost painfully slow, the program is finally starting to bear fruit. Our officers no longer have to deal with the troubles of teaching new recruits how to sound off in order, or properly grip a rifle, saving us a lot of time and heartache. \n\nNow only if they'd point those rifles in the right direction..."

Books have been printed, blackboards have been set up, and teachers have been trained. Our one-griffon education department has even conducted a surprise inspection of a school in our capital, and to their surprise, the students could disarm an armed assailant from over 20 meters away, accurately describe most events in the Empire's history, and some could even count to a hundred! Detractors of the program are now completely silent on the topic, if not coming out in support of the program - it seems like they've finally seen reason. To celebrate his success, our education minister has retired to his quarters tonight for a round of well-deserved festivities. \nTo the future! To the Griffons!

Apparently foil-wrapped chocolate bits can look very similar to the real thing. Very, very similar. \nThe subsequent investigation has revealed many deep-rooted issues within our economy, namely a people almost entirely dependent on unstable subsistence farming, the total stagnation of monetary flow between businesses, and the inability to requisition any funding from the general population for lack of any funds to requisition. Not to mention, Dusktalon and his Reformisten cronies had been seizing, without justification, the money and property of the populace for years... \nAn emergency policy meeting has resulted in a new plan of constructing additional military outposts to secure trade routes, importing foreign machinery to supplement our meagre industrial base, and adding a new agricultural service requirement to our national conscription terms. \n\nBoreas, let's hope this works."

Villages are alive with the sounds of industry, markets are bustling and open for business, and for once in a long, long time, our nation can expect to come home to a warm meal after a hard day's work. \nAnd while we're still stuck growing wheat in gravel, at least now we won't have to dig the holes with our bare claws. \n\nThat's progress, right?"

They refuse to accept their proper place, they refuse to acknowledge the superiority of the Griffon race! We cannot realise our full potential with their kind around, they must all be put to the sword!" \n\nAs his speech concluded, the riled up Reformisten began screaming for death to all the ponies and fired celebratory shots from their rifles to the sky.

These oversized rats have no place here, after all. However, trouble in paradise has reared its ugly head as regular patrols and even training exercises have ended in deadly accidents for our new officers.\n\nBe it a patrol ending with some vile bandits, or lone communists shooting an officer dead, or a mortar test fire going way off trajectory and killing some key personnel, there have been some sketchy incidents happening.

Ponies can never be trusted and have no business owning property or amassing any notable amount of wealth.\n\nFortunately enough, we managed to bust a rising pony-dominant business district local to the city of Haarsingen too!

The ensuing explosion proceeded to collapse numerous levels of the factory before it ultimately fell in on itself from lack of support pillars. Fortunately only a lone safety inspector died, but there remains the question of how this happened... Some local loyal supporters reported the owner, "Sunny Day" was staunchly anti-Reformisten and had a history of explosives experience. If it's anygriff's guess, he set up remote explosives to level his wrongly acquired property. Why didn't this come up when we were screening him and all the others earlier in the week?

His best laid plans had backfired every step of the way. "Every precaution was taken! The traitorous elements in the army were eliminated to begin with!", he continued to rant and wave. His ever trusty second in command, Rosa Heidenreich, stood idle by the door with her beak downcast, gaze averted from the pitiful state of her benefactor and leader. "We massacred them by the hundreds! By the THOUSANDS, Arcturius damn them all!"\n\nRosa's right claw tightened into a firm fist as this went on and on and... on! The Count had always been her benefactor and truly, she appreciated it, but as time progressed, it was impossible to ignore just how awful of a leader Dusktalon really was. She agreed with his dreams, but his methods? Inefficient, unstable, unadaptive! Maybe she'd be best fit for the role... but such traitorous thoughts were often eliminated from her mind. But she couldn't lie, it was beginning to become increasingly difficult to push such thoughts out of her mind as they appeared near daily now.\n\nSuddenly, the Count's fist slammed down onto his table hard enough to shake everything sitting upon it. His favourite snow globe falling off its edge and onto the floor to shatter into pieces. He hadn't shed a tear over it, shockingly enough, as his mind was focused on larger things. "Rally my staff! Rally the commanders! Rally all of them! The Reformisten will not stand for this offence, and for that we will strike back tenfold for every dent put into our plans!", the Count bellowed loud and proud, enough so to catch Rosa's direct attention finally. "Rosa, if you'll excuse me I have to clean up here, now go. Time is of the essence!"\n\nShe would've offered words of wisdom in how this wasn't the best response to these incidents, but she knew he was too set in his ways. Still, he was her superior and as such she had to continue following his orders... Unfortunately. "Of course, my Count.""

Even a prepared defence of Zeltstadt was not enough, as Silvertalon's forces were larger than we could ever expect. The Reformisten's forces have been stretched thin and we're in a very terrible position. There's no telling how much longer we can stave off a complete morale collapse in the troops, if the situation does not turn around soon... My Count! What are your orders to put down these swine?"

He wasn't a weeping sort, but even he had to admit Boreas seemingly turned His back on them. \n\nWhere did everything go so wrong? His orders were clear, his subordinates were loyal and willing, and he brought purity to Longsword! Quickly, he remembered - those damned ponies, they were the cause behind everything! The factories, Silvertalon, the arms shipments, his standing with von Katerinburg - everything! Somehow, their corrupting magic seeped into every aspect of his nation. \n\nDusktalon reached for the drawer and took his reliable pistol.

Even the victorious Reformisten were starting to have second thoughts about this plan, but they were kept in check by their zealous superiors. Longsword was purified... at a heavy cost. \n\nThe hastily erected fortifications of Zeltstadt were no match for the Reformisten onslaught, as they broke through and mercilessly slaughtered the loyalist soldiers. Conrad Silvertalon was found in his room, lying dead at the command table, pistol in his claws. The surviving commanders were quickly executed. \n\nVisaginas' forests were burning as the Reformisten were driving out the ponies, by any means necessary. For all their effort, Starry Night and most of the Partisans were able to flee across the border to Lake City, their escape covered by ponies and griffons who sacrificed themselves to enable it. In the end, it could reasonably be said not a single pony was left in Longsword. \n\nAfter all these years, setbacks and outright revolts, Count Pallas Dusktalon considered his dream fulfilled. Sure, he had to destroy most of the country to accomplish that, but did that matter once von Katerinburg learned of his success? Surely he'd get richly rewarded, maybe even gain a higher title! Now all that's left is for Rosa Heidenreich to send the letter to Hellquill, reporting of their success. \n\nOn the other claw, Rosa herself was feeling disillusioned by this outcome.

While Dusktalon is known to be a coward and a blowhard, the fact remains that the Reformisten are the winners of the Longswordian civil war.

The country is ruined, we went too far and accomplished nothing worth boasting about. It is time for you to step down", disappointment clear in her tone. \n\nThe nerve of this griffon! He has achieved his dream and so much more, and now she wants to throw it all away?! He stood up and started screeching: "Heidenreich, how dare you interfere in our sacred du-", but he didn't get to finish as one of the conspirators shot him in the head. \n\nWord of this event quickly spread, and anarchy ensued as the Reformisten turned on each other in brutal infighting.

Of all things she thought she'd be as a small girl, being a leader of bandits wasn't even a consideration. \n\nThis had gone on for months now, weeks of pointless existence off of the backs of others weaker than her.

Life after his eye opening coma had been hurried and busy. No time to look over the little things, such as the matters of his heart. His eyes had always been on that the state and his worship of Maar, the being who'd made his path clear for his clan. But this girl of Longsword? This Rosa? She was something else, so beautiful and strong! Her last name... what was it? Heidenreich? Even a name such as that carried power with it! Eriviar's mind had become consumed with thoughts of this girl. So much infatuation... he had to release it all somehow, otherwise Maar may smite him for his lack of faith with his mind elsewhere constantly. \n\nHe took to solving this dilemma in the form of letter writing. In words he described all the feelings he'd possessed lately regarding Rosa, be it admiration, romantic want, or anything else that came to mind. He cared not for fear of rejection, simply to ease himself of these emotions he'd gained. Much to his surprise the letter he'd sent was soon returned with a response from Rosa. One that was not negative in the slightest, while perhaps not nearly as emotional as his own, the beautiful griffon had written of her interest in him. Perhaps Eriviar has found the only other being who could ever exist in his heart alongside Maar..."

Up until this point he'd been so focused on his purpose in creating a better life for the members of his clan. But never did he take a step back to think of what would be best for himself. This included his complete abandonment of doing anything leisurely for himself, for the greater good of the country... By extension he'd lived quite the lonely existence. He had no time to even entertain his passing urgess on some fair maiden, the King had been utterly chaste! His mind never dwelled into such matters... at least until meeting this bird of Longsword - what's left of it at least. \n\nHe couldn't help himself but take to the pen and paper to describe the feelings he'd been having. The sensations which Rosa was now causing him to have just by the very thought of her! He couldn't care for the idea of this backfiring or being rejected, he needed it out of his system. He needed to tell her, and he finally needed to know how she felt in return. The end result was nothing less than what the King could've asked for when he received a response detailing Lady Heidenreich's mutual acceptance of such romantic interest.

While some of the male's productivity had returned, it wasn't much, as he maintained his earnest desire for Rosa. Even more so did he desire to treat her to a better life, surely such a strong female deserved a far better lifestyle! With this in mind Eriviar took it upon himself to round together the slaves acquired from a recent raid along with a decent chunk of materials and other supplies to send off south towards his beloved Rosa. It might've not been something extravagant but anything is better than nothing."
longsword.83.d_not_maar:0 "There was a jovial step in Eriviar's movements for the passing month. The positive reaction from his beloved Rosa has sent the young King into one of the most productive periods of the passing year! Previously he'd been stressed and at times saddened over his inability to find a romantic interest, now such things were utterly absent from his thoughts. Rosa's repeated replies to his own letters of desire had given the male a boost to his confidence to boot. He'd always been confident but knowing even in the romantic field he held prominence? Perfection! To privately appreciate the Longswordian he'd come to want so  much he discreetly redirected a supply train filled with slaves and quite the amount of loot from a recent raid south towards Longsword, to his Rosa."
longsword.83.a:0 "Maybe there is something to this Rosa... She deserves so much."

longsword.84.t_maar:0 "An Offer from Rosa?!"
longsword.84.t_not_maar:0 "An Offer from my Lady?"
longsword.84.d_maar:0 "Eriviar's choice to pursue Rosa hadn't gone unnoticed by her. The female had become so gleeful as time passed that Eriviar soon became the one to be surprised with receiving another letter from Rosa upon finishing yet another sacrificial session to Maar. Good news after good news it seemed, though he hadn't expected this to be the best news as when reading the violent King's heart was instantly melted from the unexpected invite by Rosa to visit Longsword himself for an "evening of fun" as she had written it. On one claw this was exactly what Eriviar would've wished for... on the other claw he had been ignoring his duties for Maar quite often, ever since his obsession with Rosa formed."
longsword.84.d_not_maar:0 "Life was swell for Eriviar. He survived his coma unscathed, he possessed a clear mind and goal, and his citizens loved him. Even more so was the fact he'd even begun to redeem his nation's reputation in the eyes of the continent! The final cherry on top of it all? Finding a lovely bird who might just be the final part to complete Eriviar's life. More good news soon arrived in the form of yet another letter from Rosa. This time she'd thanked him for the gift he'd sent previously and... offered to invite him down to her home for festivities! The servants of his Palace were treated to a strange sight when their King read over this as they'd see him jump with glee at the proposal. Though, after the initial shock his whole demeanour seemed to drop... Was he pushing this along too quickly? He'd had only spoken to Rosa in letters for most of their relationship at this point..."

longsword.87.t:0 "An Evening of Fun"
longsword.87.d:0 "The evening dawned and Rosa's desires were within reach. Initially she'd been the one to be approached by Eriviar, but now it was her turn to do some of the wooing. She'd barely done a thing besides return his affections and already she had him right in her claws. The truth was she did feel a love in return for him, a strong one at that. Enough so that after receiving his latest gift she was driven to preparing a great feast for him to partake in. In fact the feast became a front of her ultimate plan of tying the knot with him. She smirked at her joke. Nothing better than alcohol, food, and party games to get a male relaxed enough for intimacy. Initially sure, Eriviar wanted her... but now? Rosa NEEDED him. All she had to do was find the time and place to propose the question... and the time had finally come in this moment, tonight."
longsword.87.a:0 "Mead in my room, Milord~?"

longsword.88.t:0 "An Evening of Fun"
longsword.88.d_maar:0 "There couldn't have been a better sequence of events for the devout Maarite. Not only had he fulfilled his duties to his deity and been rewarded plentifully, he had possibly found a bride befitting of his station as well. The aforementioned beauty returning his interest in force to the point of inviting him to Longsword for what would effectively be a festival almost purely because of his arrival there. Rosa had taken a liking to Eriviar... perhaps as much as he'd taken to her. This was obviously the case, as during the festivities she simply couldn't keep her eyes off him, and refused to be away from him for long. Eriviar appreciated... nay, basked in the attention. That, alongside showing off in the competitions he'd partake in, the young King even winning the shooting contest. Though as the night went on Eriviar soon found himself... alone with just the pretty Longswordian. It was here he was asked quite the loaded question by Rosa. Its importance was great despite its simple stature. "Mead in my room, Milord?", she cooed gleefully with a suggestive wink and it didn't take Maar's intellect to tell where this might be going."
longsword.88.d_not_maar:0 "The nation at large was well, and now their King's mind was at ease too. It was a subtle crime that Eriviar continued administering the nation in his previous lonely state. What is a country's good health if the leader who tends to its health remains poor and decaying? Rosa was a great help for Eriviar. Initially his advisors would've felt she'd be nothing more than a cash sink that'd eventually burn Eriviar emotionally when she'd extracted enough value out of him. But they all grew quiet when it was she who offered to invite him to Longsword for a leisure trip. Some remained sceptical of the King's trip to a bandit country but... considering Rosa's reputation it'd be unlikely anyone would try offending her - especially on her own home turf. His arrival was greeted warmly by all those involved, and especially warmly by Rosa in the form of a hug and quite the bold peck on the beak. Griffons might've not been able to kiss like equines did, but the touching of beaks established the symbolism of it. \n\nEriviar embraced the attention wholeheartedly. He had little complaints of Rosa's overly warm advances or the fact she'd practically been hanging on his wing the whole evening. The girl shameless showed off her apparent attraction to Eriviar at this point - it wasn't like her underlings were going to poke fun... not without risk of losing their tongues. The festivities lasted far into the evening... though eventually Eriviar found himself alone with his lady Heidenreich. Less than a minute passed and already the two held each other's claws warmly. Eyes connecting with the oncoming silence speaking just as loud as words could. Eventually Rosa broke the silence to speak. "Mead in my room, Milord?", with the ever telling wink. Eriviar knew what his lady desired... the question then became, is now the right time?"
longsword.88.a:0 "Of course... Lead the way, beloved."
longsword.88.b:0 "I'm not interested."

longsword.89.t:0 "In the Bedroom"
longsword.89.d:0 "Her plan had succeeded. Her meek little question of sharing some mead gave fruit to the greater whole of her desires as moments later she excitedly dragged Eriviar off by the claw through numerous hallways and towards her room. Despite Longsword's reputation to outsiders, the little devilish griffoness had created quite the comfy home for herself in the capital's remnants. Of all the surrounding desolation her headquarters and de facto "Palace" provided any comfort one could expect in more civilized countries. Lady Heidenreich's room was no different as it possessed an overly luxurious bedding she'd no doubt stolen from some poor Firtreeian pony or Griffonian noble along with plentiful furniture. Even if she had to work like a low-class ruffian she sure strived to live like an upper-class lady of stature now. She'd dress like one too... privately and publicly when viable. \n\nEriviar soon learned of this as he entered his lady's room first and followed her simple orders to get comfortable. He undressed some, merely taking off his dress jacket to hang it up before moving to sit down atop the head of her large bedding. It'd be less than a minute or so before the blue-eyed beauty returned in... quite the scanty array of lingerie. It was definitely something fabricated in Skyfall by the looks of it, the fanciful black silk leaving little to the imagination. The sight of a female flaunting her body like that caused a blush to form on Eriviar's cheeks. "Milord." She hummed forebodingly, Eriviar's heart rate was quick to ramp up. He'd believed he'd be drinking mead, however... another one of his desires would be fulfilled instead. Something that'd been on his mind for quite some time."
longsword.89.a:0 "It's only fair a gentlegriff performs such for his lady, no?"

longsword.90.t:0 "A Griffoness Scorned"
longsword.90.d:0 ""Apologies but... I cannot." Those words rang through Rosa's ears violently. Her whole demeanour changed in an instant at Eriviar's shocking rejection. How lucky was he to have a pure Longswordian lady such as she offer to commit to such crass deeds - and still he declined! Rosa initially attempted to force a smile that became increasingly awkward. But barely a minute passed before the façade broke and she brazenly smacked King right on the cheek. Eriviar was shocked and stunned as it occurred. "Fiend! You lead me on like this for what? What a waste!" She exclaimed and stormed off from him, he couldn't tell if she'd be choking back tears or not as she did. But for what it was she was pissed at him. Had he really been that lustful as to give this griffoness such sultry signals? Perhaps he was at fault for this... but he couldn't know, Rosa had already stormed off to be alone. Hopefully this wouldn't escalate further... the circumstances were private, after all. The two can still be adults about state affairs... right?"
longsword.90.a:0 "The nerve!"

longsword.91.t:0 "A Wedding Proposal"
longsword.91.d:0 "Judging off the first knot the two had tied earlier and previously inviting the young King over to Longsword for festivities, Eriviar had long since taken the backseat in leading their budding relationship. Now it'd been her to ask him out on their first "date", it'd been her to initiate... more intimate matters, regardless of the fact it'd be out of wedlock, and finally now it was her who now made the most alarming proposal of all. "Oh my lovely Eriviar, I know it is so early into our romance but I believe you are the one! I've not held so much love and desire for another in the few decades I've lived, surely you feel the same? It's only fitting we bind our souls together eternally in marriage!" The written words burned themselves into Eriviar's retinas... things had progressed so fast and now it was out of his control! Is this really what he wanted? Though...at the same time it was flattering that it was her who did more of the heavy lifting. She knew what she wanted...and what she wanted was him, but was she who HE wanted?"
longsword.91.a:0 "Of course, Rosa! How could I not?!"
longsword.91.b:0 "Eh... this was all a mistake, pointless infatuation... she isn't the one."

longsword.92.t:0 "The Wedding"
longsword.92.d:0 "This was it! This REALLY was it! This was the day! Not only had she gone to visit her soon-to-be husband's home to see how he lived... which was far better than she did, bluntly put. But she also was able to meet some of his family which still lived! She got along well with all of them, only reinforcing her position as the King's perfect bride. She'd sent out some of her goons weeks in advance to the West to seek some fanciful wedding gown directly from the stores of Skyfall and they'd arrived on time for today as well. A bit rushed to fit everything but nothing impossible... and really she did look beautiful. She hadn't often worn white but in an event like this a lady such as herself shouldn't go outside the norm. The day was a haze for her as things progressed quickly, she was a schoolgirl once more with how giddy she'd be! Time went by so quickly that before she knew it, she stood right next to Eriviar at the altar being read their vows. Each asked vow being returned with a resounding..."
longsword.92.a:0 "I do!"

longsword.93.t:0 "Rejected"
longsword.93.d:0 ""Will she be fine?" "I... can't tell you to be honest, just get out of here before she sobers up." "Why?" "Because regardless of how "fine" she is, she's definitely going to be feeling particularly sadistic after reading that letter from Eriviar..." Two of Rosa's attendants spoke between themselves as they delivered the King's response to Rosa's bold marriage. They'd managed to open it flawlessly and read the answer ahead of time before delivering the letter with their boss likely to never know. The answer was a stoic and cruel decline from him. After all the letters they'd share and recent time they'd had with one another, it'd been for naught. Mere seconds after the two had spoken to one another they'd hear a loud "WHAT?!" in quite the high pitched voice crack from within Rosa's room. She now knew the King's answer and... very obviously she wasn't happy in the slightest. "Go. GO!" One of the two spoke in a hurried and anxious whisper as they each abandoned their posts to be as far away from the bombshell brewing in that room. The two felt plenty bad for whoever might cross her path in the coming hours... or weeks to come. As they left they could hear a mirror shatter faintly behind her closed door, one could say lady Heidenreich wasn't taking this too well."
longsword.93.a:0 "W-we had something, didn't we?! How could this be!"

longsword.94.t:0 "The Wedding"
longsword.94.d:0 "Such an immense amount of stress hung on Eriviar's head now. He had to make sure everything was just right for this monumental day. Rosa might've taken the lead but it was clear who still took on most of the stress in the relationship now. He'd accepted the proposal happily and scattered to find a proper engagement band and later wedding ring to give his betrothed. Not to mention gathering the members of his family in the isolated mountain ranges of his nation... and finding a place to hold the ceremony... and... and... the poor fellow had quite the workload. It quickly became apparent that running a nation wasn't nearly as difficult as organizing a wedding. Maybe it was just the expectations and anxiety of having to impress Rosa one last time. Things had to be perfect otherwise maybe she won't want him anymore! Of course chances are Rosa wouldn't be so petty but... he couldn't risk the odds. When the day finally came the only smile Eriviar could manage was a forced one, unlike Rosa, who'd been grinning like a giddy schoolgirl the whole time. Only when the procession finally came and the two stood before the altar did Eriviar finally relax. His face softening into a genuine smile as he turned to face his eternally beloved. Each vow asked of him being replied with a clear..."
longsword.94.a:0 "I do!"

longsword.95.t:0 "Teaching the Illiterate"
longsword.95.d:0 "It's no secret that the collapsed state of Longsword's government means there's no government programs in place. Which means there's no public education, which means kids aren't going to school... which means nobody can read, which means IQ levels have dropped dramatically, which means Longsword's denizens look like barbarians now. There's no hope for those still in power to fight illiteracy the moral and logical way of teaching the masses how to read and write. HOWEVER, that doesn't mean we can't take their citizenship away from them! Can't say Longsword has a high illiteracy rate if only citizens who ARE literate can be such! Of course those within the nation which aren't citizens are merely homeless squatters with no loyalty to the state! They'd make perfect candidates for the new bauxite deposits our surveyors recently discovered..."
longsword.95.a:0 "Look at those illiteracy rates drop!"

longsword.96.t:0 "Illiteracy Eradicated"
longsword.96.d:0 "Honestly? It's pretty monstrous what we just did over the past few months. But if it works, it works... and none will be the wiser just a mere decade from now. That's like... not even a blink in the march of history! We've now successfully "eradicated" illiteracy from our "happy" society. Every Longswordian citizen can successfully read and write and now we have one of the lowest illiteracy percentiles on the continent! Not to mention we've also begun producing quite the amount of processed aluminium which will no doubt help jumpstart the economy, as we FINALLY have a good that others want! There will be no shortage of workers in the bauxite mines considering the amount of illegal migrants we've discovered to be encroaching on rightfully owned government land... They don't have rights, and creatures without rights get turned into slaves!"

After a bloody civil war, the military loyalists have prevailed and have re-established the country in their image, honour and tradition being the code of law again. They've voiced their concerns about extremist elements in the Riverlands, and desire to remake the ancient treaties that bound us, with them providing a buffer territory against any pony incursions.

These Reformisten have been cruelly persecuting the local ponies, while failing to address any of the other issues in their nation. Unrest has been brewing in the nation for some time now, with the ponies forming an organised resistance against the Reformisten. Rumour has it some griffons, fed up with their government's atrocious behaviour, have joined the ponies in the struggle. Meanwhile, the military and Rosewood knights have used the opportunity to revolt as well. Leading the saner elements of both, Konrada Wavewing hopes to remind the Longswordians of their duty. Pallas Dusktalon, the Reformisten Count of Longsword, has denounced all his enemies, struggling to scramble his meagre forces."

longsword.102.d:0 "Now that dust across Longsword has settled, representatives from ponies and sympathetic griffons across the country have gathered in Visaginas, the ancient capital of the ponies of Longsword. The organization of the convention is haphazard and has no determined method of election, therefore Pony communities, villages, and partisan units have sent representatives picked in the way they see fit. \n\nAs expected, the Convention is divided between the two main factions which composed the Longsword Liberation Army. The Raudonieji, or the Red Faction, led by Starry Night, are composed of the Longswordian peasantry and lower classes, who joined the Partisan movement not just to liberate Longsword, but to create a society free of want as well. They call for an agrarian socialist system, a communal society where every person works to their ability and receives according to their need, and the ordinary village, not the industrial city, is glorified.\n\nThe Baltieji, or the White Faction, are composed of intellectuals and descendants of the Longswordian tribal nobility called the Longswordian Kings. They wish to see Longsword restored to what it once was - a harmonious, peaceful, democratic society carrying respect to the faith of Varėnė and towards each other, and they are led by a descendant of Duke Žemaitukas, Flawless Justice.\n\nFinally, coalesced around the partisan fighter Golden Morning and Longsword's first political party, "Naujoji Grifonija", is the New Griffonia movement, a clique with rather... esoteric views of forced Pony and Griffon integration. Though their presence in the Convention is miniscule, many of the Army's griffons and ponies subscribe to their ideas and could certainly play a hand."
longsword.102.a:0 "Let the convention begin!"

longsword.103.t:0 "Starry Night's Speech"
longsword.103.d:0 "For the first time in a long time, Starry Night felt nervous before a speech. For this was more than a rallying cry to fight back against the tyranny of the Black Cloaks, an appeal to rage and emotion of all those suffering under the knightly yoke. Rather, this speech was one about ideals and dreams, of how she imagined the newborn republic of Longsword. And the idea of speaking about it made her terrified to her very core. After all, the movement has gone a great way from a minor insurgency around Visaginas, integrating countless resistance groups and movements which had a single united ideal of resistance. And now representatives of them all were here, listening intently on what their current leader has to say.\n\n”Comrades...” Starry Night began, her eyes darting across the room as she tried to understand the mood, “After years of struggle and pain, we have finally become free from the bloody chains of the Reformisten and now the time has come to forge a new dream for Longsword, and with you, my faithful comrades, I will share my own.”\n\nAs the speech went on, any fear of being misunderstood and perhaps even mocked by former allies and helpers, who now stood as part of the ideological opposition, vanished as the mare put her heart into describing the utopia that Longsword would become under her command. A socialist country, yes, but one which respects and preserves the faiths and cultures of Longswordians, be they pony or griffon. A socialist country which doesn't blindly copy other experiments and their focus on workers, but understands that Longsword is unique and it's revolution is one of the farmers and peasants. A realm of the free, where one can follow their dreams and ideals in an even and fair playing field, without being forced to conform or perish under crimson chains!\n\nThe room was silent for a few moments as Starry Night finished her fiery speech, her eyes nervously darting across the room again.

According to some sources which are not fully trusted by the vanguard, Golden Morning is gathering his quite numerous supporters among the armed forces for nothing less than an outright takeover of the Longswordian government. This goes completely against his previously expressed support for the idea of allowing the populace to choose their path by the movement. And while it has been noted that there has been a growing increase of military units near Visaginas, this by itself cannot be considered an act of treason as both Raudonieji and Baltieji have similarly marshaled somewhat notable forces near the capital due to fears of potential Reformisten remnants or even foreign agents.\n\nOf course, even if the sources were trustworthy and Golden Morning and his movement were preparing a military coup, Starry Night and the vanguard are simply hesitant to strike at former comrades and allies. But rumors like this do not appear randomly and thus a choice has been made of how to treat such accusations and what actions, if any should be taken against the movement."

For many it was a rather strange event, as for the first time in years the sides and allegiances in Longsword were not defined purely by one's relations with the Reformisten. For some ponies it was even more difficult due to the fact that while griffons and even some posniaks could have developed complex political views during the reign of Pallas before it's final days, most equines were only given the choice of death or resistance, which for quite a few resulted in a somewhat simplistic view of politics and law. This meant that before today loyalties and ideas seemed to shift quite a bit as numerous representatives seemed to keep switching the idea of Longsword they supported after almost any event. With such circumstances it was a bit difficult to understand just what exactly constitution and type of government would be agreed upon, but now the final vote has come and..."

longsword.106.d:0 "Longsword's unique history has lent itself to the rise of a new culture, neither Longswordian nor Ost-Griffonian. Pony, yet also kind of... Griff? The Posniaks are Ponies who have fully integrated into Griffon culture and accepted their Archonic faith, thus abandoning the naturalistic rites of their ancestors. Over time, they grew increasingly integrated among the Griffons, moving into cities such as Swordsson, adopting their customs, developing a distinct dialect, and growing distant from the other Ponies. Though their minority is small, they look towards the other Ponies not as kin, but as cousins, no longer as the same culture.\n\nPosniaks were considered Ponies by the Reformisten and brutalized just as much, which pushed many of them to join the Longswordian Liberation Army - and yet, their political leaders continue to profess the differences between us. In the Constitutional Convention, the Posniaks stood as a separate lobby, aligned with our own - and now, they approach us wishing for their separate identity to be recognized.\n\nIs Longsword a nation of three peoples, Pony, Griffon and Posniak, or are the Posniaks just Ponies with different gods and accents?"

longsword.107.d:0 "During the civil war, it was not just Count Pallas's fanatics we had to fight. The soldiers of Pallas's army and knights of the Rosewood Order, who refused to play a part in his crimes against ponykind, rose up in arms in Panacea - there, they came into conflict with our partisans as well. Though Conrad Silvertalon and the headmasters of the Order departed for the Empire, many of their subordinates remain on our lands. Though our sides came to blows, there is an untold feeling of respect between our sides - many Griffons who served Silvertalon have surrendered to us and were treated well for their decision to resist Count Pallas, and several of the officers have offered to serve the Republic.\n\nThe question of the Rosewood Order's fate is divisive in our government. On one hand, it was the Rosewood Order which spearheaded the first military campaigns to Longsword and helped subjugate the ponies under griffon rule, so the nationalists among our ranks don't hold much sympathy towards them. And while Silvertalon and the Knights may have resisted Pallas, they resisted us as well, and many of our peers died or were wounded while fighting their own. And yet, on the other hand, even Starry Night and the Red Faction feel some form of camaraderie towards Silvertalon's griffons. Perhaps, in a different world, they could have been allies, not enemies, and it's still possible to amend that.\n\nWhat should be our policy towards the Rosewood Order? And Silvertalon's soldiers? Should they be integrated into the Longsword Liberation Army as a separate unit, one which will bring knightly expertise to our forces? Or should they be relieved of their ranks and returned to civilian life, and the Order's armories nationalized for the Army?"

Every single member of the Longswordian army would be able to recount how the Reformisten have affected them personally - a family member executed, a home village destroyed, a worldview shattered...\n\nThe leaders of the Reformisten movement will receive the gallows, there is no way around it, but what should be done about their rank and file? The Reformisten are fanatics, and to many of our peers, even the ordinary militiagriff among their ranks cannot be saved. They believe that the spirits of their victims will not rest until every single Reformisten receives their due. Others are less radical in their approach. Some of the griffs joined the Reformisten because of fear, or destitution, they were manipulated to committing evil instead of being evil at heart. If they are kept alive and informed that we will not brutalize them, perhaps they can reform over time? And, besides, if we engage in senseless revenge, would that not make us lose our moral ground?.."

Villages and towns were left deserted, factories and fields abandoned, and the few who remained had many friends to mourn over. Longsword's advantages, numerous as they may be - its strategic position for trade, its considerable resource deposits - would have been remained only on paper, and the Longswordian nation set to lose its independence against more powerful adversaries.\n\nIn the past few years, however, everything changed. The Longswordian peoples have banded together, turning vacated fields into productive farms, decaying warehouses into modern factories, and illiterate peasants into refined professionals. Swordsson, Visaginas, Haarsingen are no longer dinky towns, but rather industrial cities, connected to the rest of the country by rail, rather than hoof. When before the Longswordian Liberation Army used to rely solely on scavenging and homebrew artisan production, it could now enjoy a steady stream of supply from the Santaka Central Industrial Region.\n\nThough progress can still be made here and there - it always can - there are few who doubt that Longsword is now a modern nation. Banded under a common cause, the will and determination of its people have prevailed."

Neither of them were particularly interested in the politics taking place in Visaginas - they were military men above all else, so as long as whatever came out from the halls of the Convention guaranteed freedom for all, they were willing to serve. When news arrived of the chaos in the city, of soldiers with purple ribbons storming the Convention, of indiscriminate murder and purges of their own brothers and sisters... it left them paralyzed.\n\nGolden Morning was a difficult pony to work with. Like all of his peers, he fought not just for freedom, but a greater ideal - his ideal, however, was always far more esoteric. A vision of Longsword being a piece in the puzzle which will solve the future of creaturekind, a nation with a divine bestowed purpose to bring forth a monstrosity of a civilization. And he never shied from the fact that he would destroy as many as he needs to in order to achieve his ideal. Povner could not argue against divinity - not when their blessing guides his hoof - but this couldn't be what the Gods wanted.\n\n"And he had to kill her, too." Ludwig added bluntly. News from Visaginas were scarce, but none mentioned Starry Night's fate. Only that she was there, in the Convention, speaking on the podium when the bullets fired.\n\n"She's stronger than that, I'm sure. And I'll save her.""

They may mutter that the end will justify the means and he needs to look past the suffering he causes because the utopia he shall construct will make it all worth it... but as soon as he raises his weapon against someone personal, they start to shut him down. Only when Golden Morning pulled out a cigarette from what was once Starry Night's pack did he realize that the gushed out voice was not inside his head, however, but instead very, very corporeal. One of the ponies in the Convention was still alive, lying battered by the Vadeiva's feet.\n\n"I did. And I don't want to make it seem I am happy about it. If it weren't for her, I wouldn't be here, after all."\n\n"Then why did you kill her, you monster?!"\n\nSlowly pulling out his revolver, Golden Morning turned towards the victim wounding his conscience, doing his best to hide a scowl.\n\n"Heroes matter only as far as what they represent - and the hero which she became certainly represented an ideal. What she represented was sweet, but it would leave Ilgakardija merely a shell of the self it could become. A future never realized, a story never told, a path never taken, one which would have led to a righteous utopia. But this utopia needs a prophet, and as long as I live, I will fight to claim it."\n\nCocking his revolver and aiming it at the wounded pony, Golden Morning released a faint chuckle. \n\n"Starry once told me that she believes in destiny.

Though the situation remains full of uncertainty, communications are practically nonexistent, and most of the nation has yet to be fully informed about what's happening in the capital, Naujoji Grifonija does have an advantage. The Kariauna under Golden Morning's hoof was loyal, better armed, and better organized than the partisan units which Povner and von Pliater commandeered. They were also aware that Starry Night's allies would try to topple them, and so could fortify in Visaginas in advance.\n\nThis has gotten Golden Morning confident in their success. Clearly, the Gods favor him, not the splitter Abba and his bandits! And when the Gods manifest this victory upon his persona, their bullets will not even scratch him...\n\nThe Posniak rode out of the former Constitutional Convention building, armed only with a pistol and a small party of loyal guards, leaving his subordinate officers puzzled by his recklessness. As Povner's forces descend upon Visaginas, the first of their snipers taking their shots, thousands of voices in Morning's head converge into one - challenge your old friend face to face, and show him that your gods are superior to his!"

The entire nation is now under his hoof - unfortunately. He would have returned it to Starry Night, but all hopes of finding her alive were dashed when her corpse was found... The remnants of the Constitutional Convention have confirmed Povner's regime and granted him emergency powers under extraordinary circumstances - it falls to his shoulders to keep the revolutionary dream alive, and maybe, just maybe, find a way to take revenge against the Griffons who have made such a travesty of their country."

Ponies shall be provided with textbooks detailing the glorious history of the griffons, their racial qualities and inherent traits which they need to learn from them, and vice versa for Longsword's griffons.

The Posniaks went even further, accepting the griffon pantheon almost completely and crafting a unique culture throughout centuries. Nowhere else will this nature reflect more than in a new pantheon for their people.\n\nA mass campaign of religious clarification has begun and the old temples have been seized to preach a new set of gods. Centered around the merged goddess of Varėnė-Arcturia, the new Longswordian pantheon proclaims that the faith of the ponies of the past was somewhat misled, for they focused too much on each other instead of recognizing that the same gods blessed their griffon neighbours. All deities aside for them are not truly divine - the traditional Riverlander beliefs worship demigods born from Varėnė-Arcturia, and the Alicorns are merely magical ponies who received blessings from her. Old traditions are being disassembled, replaced by new religious holidays, observations and practices, mandatory to attend for every citizen. The remnants of the Kriwe class, understandably, disagreed, and many of them outright refused to abide by this newly constructed Longswordian faith, declaring it heretical and an affront to the gods.

Is it fair for him to punish and execute those who stand against him when he himself had to hide from Reformisten fanatics?\n\nIn the cold, dark depths of the palace of Sofia von Tyzenhauzen, a lonely Morning was visited by an apparition. A shapeless cloud at first, it took the form of Starry Night, and then began to speak.\n\n"Have you come here to atone?"\n\n"Have you come here to finally tell me I was right?"\n\nFaced with a question against hers, the apparition tilted its head. "All I've learned so far is that I was wrong. I thought of you as better than Katerinburg's lackeys, but now, I see that you were a tyrant worse than him in the making."\n\n"A tyrant? Worse than him?!" Morning instantly gushed out in response. "You... I... His slaughter was just senseless bloodshed, death in the name of death, with the veil of purity. But not mine. If I could fulfill Longsword's destiny without a single death, I would."\n\n"And yet that's not stopping you, is it? It did not stop you from killing our comrades, squashing all hope of liberty... it did not stop you from killing me. It did not stop you from forgetting all those heartwarming letters you used to send me... All cold hearted murderers start the same way as you. They cling onto an ideal, they declare that they will kill for it, they preach words of fate and certainty - and history remembers them only as tyrants. Your tyranny of an idea, is it all you're going to serve?"\n\nMorning withdrew his pistol and opened fire, his bullet striking an ancient portrait and ricocheting away.

Join mass rallies in support of his speeches, sign up for youth organizations and labour unions with his name, and follow his lead.\n\n"But it isn't genuine."\n\nGeneral Silver Sunset, listening to the Vadeiva's barely coherent string of thoughts in an empty conference hall, stayed silent, allowing Golden Morning to express himself fully.\n\n"They fear. They see what happens to those who do not fit into the Ideal, and they fear. They do not change. They do not let themselves rebuild their hearts and minds from the ground up, they do not surrender to fate. They cling to what is simple, instead of following what is just."\n\n"Is that really an issue?" Silver Sunset finally opened up. "Our hoof is firm in Longsword, and your reforms keep the nation in line. As long as you believe in what's right, so will the country."\n\n"But that's not the point!" a yell suddenly interrupted the general.\n\n"I'm not here to be a tyrant. If I wanted to be a tyrant, I would not have started this in the first place. But there's a future on the line. There's a Griffonia to save. But at a time when the world needs to be saved the most, it acts cunning, hides a knife behind its back, and pretends to care while getting ready to slit my throat."\n\nDefeated, the Vadeiva slumped to his seat, pulling out the last of Starry Night's cigarettes and lighting up. "Griffonia is divided between two different worlds. East and West. Griffon and Pony. And unless someone forces them both to kneel and unite, they will continue to shed each other's blood until the end of time. We all experienced this wheel of time in practice ourselves.

This drive has increasingly become more and more totalitarian. All sections of public and private life are becoming ideologically charged - the government in Visaginas certifies food which can be eaten by both species and is thus allowed, approves or disapproves newborn names based upon its ideological doctrine, encourages platonic, symbolic marriages between ponies and griffons, et cetera, et cetera...\n\nAll citizens of Longsword are provided with newly printed "purple books", propaganda documents which both serve as a listing of the Vadeiva's ideological statements and a detailed how-to guide for all citizens of Longsword. How they are supposed to act to friends and to strangers, what their posture should be, what lingo they should use, and what principles their life should follow - the hardworking nature of the ponies and the thrift of the griffons, the compassion of the ponies and the hierarchical nature of the griffons. While some only loosely follow these guidelines, others, especially younger ponies and griffons, have taken these books to heart, wave them around and form ferocious gangs.

Many states have fallen because they failed to follow these two traits, and almost all of the nations which dot Griffonia and Equus today are doomed to follow after them."\n\n"Communists and other revolutionaries fail to realize the first. The states they envision are mechanical, stripped of all innate heritage, sense of spirit, doomed to be nothing but materialistic contraptions unfitting of the nature of their citizens.

Adorned by complacency, they abandon security, content with passive supervision of its citizens and a hoof of friendship towards foreign threats. Much like a creature's body needs to always contend with germs inside and enemies outside, so does a national body - it must always remain vigilant of threats within and without, and it needs to be proactive.

They had to, otherwise they would all be broken under the uncaring hooves of the world. Golden Morning knew this, as did his soldiers. He just had wanted the locals of the border regions to understand it as well. The regions needed to be fortified, no matter what, and the villages and fields that lay in the way had to be removed. It was that, or their deaths. \n\nAs the elderly farm pony that had pushed his way past Golden Morning's soldiers screamed at him, teary-eyed, asking what he thought he was doing razing his family's farm, the Vadeiva could only stare back with cold contempt. Contempt at this foal that still did not understand what was needed to safeguard them all. And yet, ever so briefly, there was a glint of pity. This poor little pony only mourned his loss. He yelled about how Golden Morning had turned their back on them, asking if his words of freedom really was nothing but lies and deceit, and Morning felt the contempt swell. \n\n"You're right," he drawled in response, slowly pulling out a cigarette from Starry Night's pack. "I must have made a dreadful mistake. I should have stayed back, kept my mouth shut, and let whatever travesty came from the Visaginas Convention take place. Then sit down and watch the end of the world. After all, we had "freedom" for a few decades before our death, so it's all worth it, right?" he asked, staring the pony down. "Make your choice. Freedom, or a future?" Maybe this old foal would understand when pushed to the knife's edge, like Golden Morning had.\n\nHe didn't. All he did was spit in Golden Morning's face. \n\nSlowly, he wiped the spit away, as the light in his eyes began to die. So be it, then.\n\nOnly at the very last second did the farmer realize that he was no longer staring into a pony's eyes.

It's a miracle that he's fallen to our hands in one piece - while the child had personally done nothing wrong, his name and lineage are followed by curses in Longswordian vocabulary, and any average soldier would have likely lynched him on the spot. Ever since the fall of Griffenheim, the young griffon has been held in custody away from the front, provided for and guarded by a handful of fanatically loyal pony soldiers - but this status quo cannot stay forever. Having silenced the calls of his subordinates to execute the child, Golden Morning has received two possible ideas.\n\nOne offers to send Grover to the forests of southern Longsword for permanent exile. The logging camps and agrarian communes of Longsword can certainly use more labor, and there, forced to serve as an equal to ponies and griffons, in contact with different traditions and numerous cultures, he can be groomed to be a model citizen. Perhaps, if the former Emperor shows promise, accepts pony culture into his heart, and integrates into the National Body, he can be provided with a Riverpony wife and touted as an example of unity between ponies and griffons.\n\nAnother idea sees this approach as too soft towards someone who represents the Grover lineage - the family which has done more than any other to cause strife between ponies and griffons. This proposal calls a massive show trial, where the former Emperor shall be put on the stage and forced to listen to witnesses from the entire Empire, each one detailing the crimes of the Grover dynasty. Historians will list all the belligerent wars, exploitation and suffering caused by his predecessors, Longswordian partisans will detail the horrors which Grover II's Knightly Orders caused in Vartai to modern day, Griffonian peasants will explain the injustices of the Imperial system and how their lives suffered from the feudal structure.

Perhaps, one day, Rijekograd and Lake City will be able to match Griffenheim.\n\nPaying it little thought, Golden Morning sat down in the throne at the palace's heart, looked through the empty hall surrounding it, and finally turned his eyes to the ceiling.\n\n"Is it over?"\n\nThe propaganda made sure to hide it, but by now, Morning was almost unrecognizable from the young, handsome stallion which had once joined the Longsword Liberation Army. The weight of each and every decision falls onto his shoulders, every single day passes as a string of tasks and orders from early morning to midnight, not a moment to himself, especially not during war, which at this point has become constant.

All of it added to a severe toll, all of it left him frail, determined to push forward only with the knowledge that this struggle will bring a better life to everyone.\n\nAfter a few seconds, the stallion's expression soured.

The city continued to burn. The griffons were resisting, organizing underground societies, griffon nations outside of the Empire's reach will surely begin to act soon, too. And all of them wanted to expel the ponies out of Griffenheim. The real war was only beginning. \n\n"Fine. Then I'll fight until it's over.""

The integration of ponies, griffons and other races into a single peaceful national body, seen as a fantasy a mere few decades prior, has been successfully achieved. A new generation is growing up, one absorbed into the integral revolution from their birth to the end of their lives, following their role in a harmonious society which stretches from sea to sea.\n\nThe war between East and West has been put to an end. The wheel of time has been broken, the chains which bound Griffonia to descend to a path of self-destruction are over. From here on out, all creatures of the continent follow a new path.\n\nEver since the Griffking Empire was declared, it was a monarchy without a monarch - but now, this regency was finally put to an end. For his years of guidance to Longsword and finally much of Griffonia, for his impressive victories and the conquest of an empire as great and impressive as that of the Grovers, for the liberation he has passed down to millions of creatures, Golden Morning was finally bestowed the crown of the Griffking Empire in a massive ceremony in Swordsson. Before hundreds of thousands of people from the entire Empire, the pony announced the beginning of a new era in world history.\n\nOppressive legislation, forced integration policies, and concentration camps could all finally be loosened or abandoned respectively. The people have gained the Emperor's trust that they've become model citizens. Fear was no longer necessary to keep them in line.\n\nThere will never be fear again.

It's been years since he's been here - and a lot has changed since then. Though his plain clothes did not show it at first glance, he was no longer just the dictator of a military regime, but an Emperor of the larger part of Griffonia. A liberator and peacebringer followed by millions. The voices in his head have ceased - he did not know if the Gods considered his mission complete or whether they were simply biding their time, but for now, he was free. Weak, but free.\n\nTo Morning's surprise, Starry Night's ghost chose to appear. Clouds of dust and smoke swirled around him, leaving a chill in the air, before manifesting as the same young, plain mare he killed so many years ago. Whether she really was the spirit of Starry or a magical apparition posing was her, Morning did not know and did not care. \n\n"Are you happy now?"\n\n"...No."\n\nThe apparition tilted its head. "How so? When such a single drive overtakes someone's mind, you'd imagine that fulfilling it would leave them satisfied. Or do you still think you have work to do?"\n\n"Why do you care?" Morning suddenly gushed out. "You never believed in me. You always thought that I'd either die or become a tyrant like the rest. So what, now that I did not do either, you're just going to forget all that and act so soft towards me?"\n\n"I won't. I still believe that what you did was unjustifiable," the apparition replied, calmly, and struck a smile. "But I can still hope for a former friend to be happy, right?""

In fact, if you haven't noticed, the more murder happy, tyrannical and despicable a villain is, the greater chance that they follow an ideal greater than life."\n\n"But what I've achieved isn't villainous. It's peace across the continent, prosperity for everyone, a feeling of harmony..."\n\n"Will the millions who died in its wake get to enjoy this utopia?"\n\n"They won't... But they sacrificed themselves for something greater. The choice was between a few millions dead and eternal peace achieved, or many more millions dead in eternal war."\n\n"And that's the crux of my point, isn't it?" the apparition suddenly interjected. "That's the difference which makes an unrestrained ideal so dangerous. Nobody truly wants to do something as horrid as to take a creature's life, neither you nor me - and an ordinary creature, who just wants to defend his home or live a normal life, will always have this morality tugging against them. But a person like you, whose mind is dominated by a some sort of greater ideal, will not have this restraint. They might still feel uncomfortable with the act sometimes, but they have done the math, and if that math shows that killing one creature will bring them closer to utopia, they will choose to do so without hesitation. And when you murder one, what stops you from killing another, a hundred, a thousand, a million? After all, your vision of the future will surely eclipse the loss of so many lives!"\n\n"And you..."\n\n"I believed in something. I knew what I wanted Longsword to be like and I knew that it would be better for everyone. But I made sure to never forget that after all is said and done, I am just a mare. A mare who wants to protect her home and the people she loves, and that, when it comes to choose between staying as myself and following destiny, I would always choose the former. You chose the other way. You sacrificed your soul for a desire which isn't even yours. You turned from a freedom fighter to someone who oppresses freedom fighters, your name will forever be cursed by your victims, and you will never be able to wash away this stain."\n\n"I'm..." Morning muttered, his voice stuttering, the passion in his broken body having long since faded, and turned to the side, trying to avert his eyes from Starry's gaze. "...sorry."\n\n"Don't be. I was the one who failed to prevent this, not you."\n\n"I loved you."\n\n"I know."\n\nThe apparition dissipated into mist, never to be seen again.

All of this tracked down the source to Longsword - the madpony Abba Povner and his regime dumped hundreds of tons of arsenic into the Griffking River, poisoning the river water and causing uncountable deaths. Water rationing has been implemented and the arsenic is expected to eventually fade to a point where its concentration is no longer lethal, but until then, we have to endure all of the plague's effects."

At what point does revenge for genocide become a genocide in its own right?\n\nThroughout the years, many of Povner's friends and allies, those who survived the war of resistance against Count Pallas, stepped away from his fanatical goals - whereas those who remained have become devout, mindless followers, almost indistinguishable from possessed thralls. One of his few friends who remained by his side, albeit reluctantly so, was Ludwig von Pliater.\n\n"What now, Abba?"\n\nThe question got the pony to turn around, facing his Griffon friend with a smile, for the first time in many years.\n\n"It's over, Ludwig. What the Gods wanted me to do, I have done. The vengeance Varėnė wanted to be given, I have now given," Povner explained - even the tone of his voice appeared more enthusiastic than the griffon knight ever heard it being. "Our brothers and sisters no longer have to anguish in Her eternal hunting grounds. Enough blood has been spilled for all of theirs, and so they can rest."\n\n"I understand that... but now that it's been achieved, what now?"

Povner struck a smile, he began to fade, until finally, he became one with the dust and the cloud took off to the sky, dissipating into nothingness. Pliater was left on the field alone.

The Rosewood Knights were well known for their coldness and laconic attitude, a duty instilled into their recruits through decades of training - and the Grand Mistress, Konrada Wavewing, was the greatest example of this ideal.\n\nNot long after Silvertalon arrived, she handpicked ten of her most loyal knights without a single word spoken and led the General towards the grand hall of the castle.

What they have today is a chance to rebuild what has been wronged and restore the honor of Longsword, so it may continue to serve its duty in the greater Griffonian Empire.\n\nSilvertalon's position was different. To him, there was no turning back the clock - the past he experienced in his youth and the Rosewood Order seeks to defend may have been glorious and honorable, but you cannot rewrite the beliefs of an entire nation and subjugate them to what they've already abandoned. Longsword need to heal, and in order to heal, it needs a compassionate, constitutional government where all the citizens of Longsword are represented and which will establish a harmonious system - and the Longswordian army is the only force in the country which can manage this transition.\n\nBoth of the sides stand by their visions, but only one of them may end up adopted - and so one of them will have to stand down and accept the other's lead.

They fought, they made peace, they commenced raids against pony and griffon alike, but they hardly saw each other as a part of a single nation. Their allegiances lied with their chief, their tribe and with their Gods, rather than some perception of a united Vartai. Unfortunately, these centuries of harmony and bliss could not last. The clouds were gathering, powerful centralized nations were forming around the lands of our people, all intent to take their piece.\n\nIn the past, the ponies of Vartai pushed back attempts by Lake City's conquerors to subjugate us, they sparred against the armies fielded by Katerin and rendered their expeditions to dust. Though small and divided, they would unite in the face of a superior threat, and then return back to the status quo once peace has been achieved. But this could not last when Grover first touched upon the Idol of Boreas. Surely, if the Emperor of Griffonkind and his successors turned their eyes to the East, Vartai, and Longsword with it, would be the first to fall - unless it finally learns the value of unity.

In two decades, he subjugated the clans of Kupiškis, marched his Kariauna eastward, to destroy his rivals in Indrija, and finally crossed the Griffking River to make Northern Vartai bend its knee.\n\nIn the west, he built a new capital, Varėna, to commemorate his patron deity, and constructed the Romuva fortress as a symbol of faith and war alike. Seeking to unite all ponies in these lands under one banner, he abandoned his past title and crowned himself Grand Duke of Longsword, he uprooted the nobility of old and formed a new one from his followers and soldiers, and he eyed both east and west in search for new prizes to add to his empire.

One after the other, our holy forests were torched, our towns were razed and those who survived were forced to kneel and watch Longsword be plundered.\n\nThe Grand Duke and his Kariauna fought as long as they could, using the terrain to their advantage and letting Grover chase him across the land like a madgriff, but one too many skirmishes and battles reduced their ranks to a paultry one thousand ponies-at-arms.

When Grover's forces marched to the smouldering ruins, they found no valuables or prisoners, only ash.\n\nThe few remaining members of his family, including my ancestor, and the surviving Longswordian nobility were assembled before the Emperor in Visaginas.

This could not stand, but for now, Silvertalon needed the support of those industrialists, politicians and intellectuals, so they stayed.\n\nIn his small council which composed the core of the Provisional Government, the General increasingly came to rely on one griff in particular. Solarpluff Engelberg was an advisor to the government of Count Pallas's father, helped implement several important industrial reforms and establish new industrial zones in Swordsson, only to be removed by the successor and so move to the opposition. Carrying decades of experience with him and yet dedicated solely to the prosperity of Longsword, Engelberg was noticed by Silvertalon's eye not long after joining the council, and swiftly gained the General's favor.\n\nBoth of them share the goal of a harmonious, democratic Longsword which will atone of Count Pallas's excesses, and both can tell that if they work together, they may be able to achieve it."

And yet, when the issue of new civil code and constitutional frameworks came up to the Provisional Government, it immediately threatened to split the fractured council. \n\nEveryone had their own idea of what Longsword should look like. Silvertalon's fellow officers were certain that only a strong hand regime can ensure stability in the fractured countryside and so called for laws which would grant the government high leeway in dealing with troublemakers. The commoners of Swordsson and Haarsingen, making up the business delegations, preferred a more representative system with more lax laws and regulations which would allow the average griffon to prosper with their own merit. Solarpluff Engelberg managed to convince General Silvertalon out of dismissing those clinging to their own ideas, however, and offered to listen out to both sides instead.\n\nIn response, Engelberg offered to invite legal scholars from the West, graduates of Yale's prestigious universities - with their insight, it can be possible to create a legal system which is objectively perfect no matter which person observes it.

longsword.149.d:0 ""You know, me and my comrades would often discuss your family back in the Reformisten days. None of us had actually seen the Emperors, so we crafted the wildest and most terrifying pictures of them - villains have to be terrifying, after all, and the Grovers were the greatest villains of all. And yet, none of us guessed that the real deal will be a whimpering child..."\n\nUnder the Vadeiva's watch, a pony and a griffon guard unlocked the former Emperor's cell, and the young monarch walked out. He may have been frightened before, but now, standing before the pony dictator who had overthrown him, he got a surge of boldness. A set of eyes stared at Golden Morning in a mix of anger, determination and defiance - and yet, he wasn't phased at all, instead taking his time to remove the cigarette from his mouth. "So then, usurper, are you here to watch an Emperor die?"\n\n"You certainly speak more mature than you are," Morning calmly replied and cracked a smirk. Even an automaton of destiny like himself could find amusement in the predicament. Here he was, once a partisan with no schooling, determining whether an Emperor lives or dies. "I don't need you dead. It's efficient, and maybe it's just for some, but it wouldn't prove anything."\n\n"What do you mean?"\n\n"Maybe if I were just a tyrant who wanted power to himself, it'd be advantageous to me. But I'm here for a new Griffonia, not for any needs which I might have. And if I want to turn a new leaf in Griffonia's history, how else will I make it permanent than by converting the spawn of the lineage which had been imposing their will upon the continent until now?"\n\nGrover understood little about what the pony meant, and had even less time to think about it. Quickly, the young griff was hurried to Griffenheim's train station - there, dressed in rags, alongside hundreds of prisoners of war, he was pushed into an animal wagon and began his long journey to the East. \n\nThe collective farm near Visaginas was given the duty to raise the former monarch, and they immediately began preparing for the task. As soon as Grover stepped out of the train and got a chance to admire the scenery - the forest was more lush and darker than anything he had seen back home - he was hailed by a young mare a little under his age, who carried an axe and a bottle of water with herself, flashing a smile at the griff. The Morning government handpicked the mare most fitting for their ultimate goal for Grover - to turn him into a model example of the union of two species."

It was chock full of soldiers from the Longswordian army and citizens invited to witness the event, even the Vadeiva himself, Golden Morning, was attending the "ceremony". Grover was seated at the defendant's table and remained silent, frozen by the sight of thousands of eyes all staring at him. The microphones were all tested and connected to the radio waves, and millions more across Griffonia tuned in to the event. As soon as everyone got ready, the charade began.\n\n"Court is now in session for the trial of the House of Grover, represented today by its last remaining head, seated at the defendant's table," the judge, an educated Griffon former partisan from Longsword, began. "The prosecutor and witnesses may now present their evidence."\n\nA conga line of witnesses, all with their own grievances towards the dynasty. A historian from Swordsson, a member of the Longswordian Kings, was given the floor first, and recounted the story of the Crusades in Vartai - especially all of the crimes against the local ponies which Grover II's armies committed in their campaigns. A former Reformisten was pushed to the center in chains and loudly proclaimed that in the name of the Grovers, they took up the torch against all of Ponykind, and murdered thousands for little purpose. A small group of peasants from Interriver followed and explained that ever since Grover I took power in Herzland, he squeezed every last bit from his subjects to fund his conquests and lavish palaces, ignored the hunger and famine of the peasantry, and created an unjust system which persisted to this day. Even Golden Morning himself stepped forward to say a few words - explaining that the Grovers had done more than any other family to ruin the chance of a perfect union between Ponies and Griffons, that they willingly led the continent to war against itself, and wished for it to self-destruct.\n\nThe former Emperor was given no lawyer and only a few minutes to defend himself - but unable to say anything, he merely broke into tears. The judge's verdict was clear - for millions of listeners, he proclaimed that the House of Grover shall never have the mandate to rule Griffonia, and that Grover VI will be held imprisoned for the rest of his life."

Born to lives of war, these noblegriffs have chosen to take the burden of running a country in peace, a task which few of them had prepared for before. While those knights who originated from landowning families in Herzland and beyond might have brought some skills in management with them, the rest had to study bureaucracy, economics and politics from scratch. They followed orders dutifully, however, and study circles were formed among the Order's chapters for that purpose.\n\n"And we've already made progress, have we not?" Brother Siegfried von Pluckwangen, a griffon of intimidating stature even among the Knights, stated during a stroll across the halls of Palisander Castle, the heart of the Order. Next to him was Grand Mistress Konrada Wavewing, silent as always - when her fellow knight suddenly stopped, so did she.\n\n"Perhaps, though he never vocalized it, Grand Master von Jungenwing had envisioned something like this from the very beginning. If it is our task to defend tradition and Griffonkind, then do we not deserve a state to support that goal?"\n\nWavewing remained silent. Eventually, however, she blurbed a brief "Yes."\n\n"In that case, Sister Wavewing, you should be proud that you have achieved his dream," von Pluckwangen continued, only to shut his beak when a glare beamed at him. "Ah-right, do not feel proud, that is not the Rosewood way. Feel humble that the wheel of time has turned towards you."\n\nWavewing said nothing, aside for a dismissive nod. There was no her in the transpiring events. Her life was sworn to nothing but the Rosewood tradition, and that's what it should stay with."

A troupe of musicians, dancers and street actors from Katerin, they caught the attention of the locals by putting on a performance in the city square, getting many of the griffons and ponies to dance with them.\n\nWhile the event was orderly and there were no ruffians to cause trouble, the knightly council of the Rosewood Order decided to dispatch more guards to the city anyway - quite a few of them ended up joining with the singing and the dancing. But not the Grand Mistress herself. From the castle, alongside a few trusted knights, she made her way to the ceremonies herself, getting more than a few griffs fleeing in fright. Not to participate in the fun, but rather to take a glance and ensure that her subjects do not engage in anything unacceptable.\n\nThen, one of the Katerin musicians, a young-ish looking griff with a lute in her claws, began playing a different, sadder tune - it may have been meant for ballroom dance and not for a crowd of citizens, but the people of Zeltstadt caught on with the change and followed along. The Grand Mistress was left frozen, however. Something had stirred inside of the stoic griffon, and she immediately excused herself from the knights party. None of the soldiers got a reason for her departure, only an order."

longsword.153.d:0 "The Katerin musician was brought into Palisander Castle by two heavily armored knights, who, as training required them, were always ready to draw their weapon even if their escort was just an unarmed peasant. The speed with which she was brought across the halls meant that she had little chance to appreciate the scenery - and though the Castle was cold and soul-crushing, it was still awe-inspiring for the travelling musician. Eventually, she was shoved into the main hall, where, on the other side, the Grand Mistress was waiting.\n\nEven in full armor and after four decades of separation, that face was unmistakably familiar.\n\n"S-sister?.."\n\nWavewing stopped in her slow march. She had wanted to ask the musician about her song and whether there was something special about it, but this sudden yell froze her. Seeing the silence as the green light to move on, the captive continued:\n\n"It's me, Glinda... What happened to you? Mom and Dad thought you're dead, and yet you're... here..."\n\nNarrowing her eyes, the Grand Mistress stepped forward, pulled out a dagger and raised it by her beak, her voice uncharacteristically ferocious. "What madness are you insinuating?!" Frightened by the sight, the musician quivered, almost breaking into tears. After all, even if it really was her sister, she's become a warrior so ominous and powerful that even the knights of the holy orders of Katerin would shake in their boots.\n\n"Please don't..."\n\nGlinda's memories of her sister were distant and faint, but there were a few things she did remember. Out of the two Crowbeak children, Cynthia was always the louder and more troublesome one - and to calm her down, their father would often pick up his lute and play... this tune, right? Slowly, the musician began whistling the melody. Almost immediately, the Grand Mistress lowered her knife, her eyes open wide and her mind struggling to comprehend the torrent of thought washing across her."

It could not be insubordination, it was for the good of the Order and Sister Wavewing in particular. Siegfried von Pluckwangen, having been glancing to the side to avoid the her stare for as long as possible, finally glared back and replied:\n\n"I'm sorry, Sister Wavewing, but it appears that you have been gravely misdirected. That griff is clearly insane, and whatever she is insinuating, it is merely the fables of her broken mind."\n\n"I would like to be the judge of that myself," the Grand Mistress bluntly replied. Von Pluckwangen could not allow himself to show it, but the stubborness was really getting under his nerves. Alas, that's what he should have expected to deal with when standing against the Grand Mistress.\n\n"You are our Grand Mistress, but we cannot grant you that power."\n\nWavewing remained silent, and then finally turned around. If the Order demands, then any knight, no matter if they are a new member or the Grand Master, must acquit and follow. And yet... one of the tenets of the ideal Rosewood Knight is the search for truth. No matter the situation, a Rosewood Knight cannot allow himself to live in a world of lies. And if it takes defiance to the Order's demands to find out the truth behind what this 'Glinda' meant... then so be it."

The Order may have barred her from visiting the prisoner, but the rank and file of the knight ranks were more concerned by the furious stare of the Grand Mistress and what she might do if her request was not met. The few griffons foolish enough to follow their orders changed their minds after a brief melee. As soon as the frightened musician in her cell was assured that Wavewing was not here to oversee her execution, she began telling their story.\n\n"We grew up in Straßmark, not far off from the Scheißwald - our father was a musician, just like me. You didn't get to stay with us for long, though. Back when you were... six years old, perhaps?.. we had to flee from a raid on our region, but in the middle of everything that happened, you and the rest got separated deep within the forest and that's the last of what we heard of you. We both know what Katerin is like, so we assumed that the raid was the work of your usual bandit gangs - and so we just... assumed they found you and left you for dead - never did we expect you to find out here, in Longsword."\n\nGlinda turned her eyes away to the side, her voice growing fragile. "I'd love to say that I never lost hope that you might still be alive... but, really, I just wished to find you somewhere because life had turned a lot more lonely for me since then."\n\nWavewing remained silent - not because of her usual stoicness, but rather because she simply did not know what to say. The Order of Rosewood had always prided itself in the fact that many of their finest knights served in the knighthood since their youth, thus growing up with the right values instilled within them - but to think that they would go as far as to kidnap children in order to turn them into warriors... And that she was one of them - the story added up, after all. Why else would her memories of her childhood be nonexistent..?\n\nHow could that possibly follow knightly virtue?

A lookalike was placed in the cell instead, and the Order's griffons did not dare to question the few physical changes. In exchange, the Grand Mistress requested two things. One was to not call her Cynthia Crowbeak, even if that might be her real name - simply bringing it up carried far too much emotion for her to handle, especially when she was still grasping with the implications of her heritage. The second was to meet each other, from time to time, to let the knight learn more about a past which had, up to that point, has been a mystery to everyone, including herself.\n\n"What do I do now, Glinda?.." the knight muttered under her breath, staring out the window, leaving her cup of tea cold.\n\n"What do you mean?"\n\n"I... My whole life, the knighthood is everything I had ever known. I believed that I had chosen to serve virtue and so I did everything in my power to serve that virtue. And now, you have come into my life and revealed that everything I fought for was a lie. That so many years ago, I was kidnapped, turned into a knight by force, and stand here only because of that."\n\nCowering somewhat, not sure how to respond, Glinda turned her eyes to the side. "I mean... you're a big deal here now, right? Those knights who first brought me to the castle said they acted on your orders..."\n\n"Well, I am in charge of the nation, more or less..."\n\n"Then can't you do something to change this? You... clearly have a vision of what your Order should be like, and that there are things which you believe are wrong with what it's currently like. If you don't set things right, who will?"\n\n"But how can I have that vision you speak of?" Wavewing suddenly raised her voice. "The Order and its tenets is all I've ever believed in." Glinda wasn't convinced, she slightly tilted her head and replied:\n\n"Then you wouldn't be so ruffled about what happened, no? You'd simply accept that the Order was right to kidnap you and move on. Since you don't, there is clearly something inside you which tells you that some things are right, outside of what knightly duties tell you.""

He may have finally met his demise at the end of my Zweihänder, but not without the cost of a smashed beak, crushed claw, and many, many desperate prayers to Arcturius.\n\nMy Brüder may praise my narrow victory now, but the bloodstains dripping on this very parchment I am writing on will ceaselessly remind me to never underestimate the foes of this land ever again, lest I join that pony warrior in the heavens.\n\nPetru de Sydia.\""

Perhaps the great wheel of fate blessed me that morning, for that mysterious pony and I began conversing, coming back day after day every misty morning underneath this same tree.\n\nHis name was Širdis, follower of the goddess Varėnė who had come to challenge me, representative of Arcturius, in a debate about who was the truest warrior of the two, he said. Yet, as many moons of dialogue passed, we began seeing eye to eye, not as two, but as one.\n\nIt eventually struck him like a thunderbolt.

Also - if my romantic excesses may be indulged - an exceedingly fair place, situated by a small tributary to the Griffking in the rolling hills of these lands.\n\nThe acquisition was by and large expedient, and the tools given to me for the job proved quite sufficient to ensure that the locals were persuaded to donate it to the order. After recent events, their tempestuous nature has been curtailed quite effectively, and there were only occasional needs for my brothers to intervene more firmly. For the vast majority, the virtue in giving up their dwellings to us stood clear, and they departed with an impressive humility.\n\nYet, one small issue has arisen, which I feel pertinent to bring before You. During the acquisition, a fair number of natives threw themselves to the ground before me, quite fervent in their desire to stay on the land, and I decided to write to You of this. Though there will be no shortage of faithful griffons who seek to migrate into these lands, yet perhaps these natives can be taken on as servants of the order. I was told they would not require pay as long as they can stay on their 'ancestral lands', and though I am loath to indulge their delusions, I am nevertheless convinced their servitude may serve to civilize them.\n\nThe choice, however, lies with You, and beyond this trifling matter I have little else to report.

They glittered as waterfalls usually do, but somehow she felt like the glimmering was more intense than it should be. Perhaps that's where the name of the region came from?\n\nOut of curiosity, she flew closer to investigate. Perhaps the water had magical properties, and could be sold off for profit? But as she landed and examined stream of water, she saw flakes of shining grey silver floating in it. Her eyes widened and she grinned widely."

Rosa, the group's leader, took out her binoculars and surveyed her surroundings.\n"You think they spotted us coming, boss?" Heinrich, one of the bandits, asked.\n"I don't think. I know. They've been trailing us for miles, trying to stay hidden. Because fools such as you didn't notice, I'd say they're doing a good job."\nHeinrich frowned and looked where Rosa was pointing her binoculars. His eyes widened as he saw another group flying up the mountain.\n"Ah, looks like they're coming out to meet us," Rosa said. "Let's hope this 'Blackrock' is among them. Griffs, drop your weapons! We're not here to cause trouble."\nThe bandits obeyed and dropped their rifles, yet kept their knives in their sheaths, just in case. The other group of griffons arrived, and a white griffoness stepped forth. "What's this motley of rabble? Did you get lost?"\n"No, we're not lost. In fact, I think we found what we were looking for," Rosa said with a smirk.\n"And what the heck were you trying to find in MY lands?"\n"You. Miss Blackrock, I presume?"\nBlackrock narrowed her eyes at first, and her bandits readied their weapons. Rosa's own group was tempted to grab their own rifles. "Are you Rosa Heidenreich?" Blackrock asked, her voice cold as ice.\n"Indeed," she replied and tipped her black Reformisten cap.\nTensions dissipated as Blackrock began to laugh. "You're a bold bitch, coming by yourself over here! I could've shot you hours ago."\n"I saw you, and I would've shot you first," Rosa said with a grin.\nBlackrock chuckled and playfully punched her in the shoulder. "Good to see a fellow bandit queen. Say, want to go raid a Prywhenian village? We'll split the loot evenly."\n"Of course," Rosa said with a smile, and motioned her bandits to pick up their guns.

Rosa said.\nBlackrock lifted an eyebrow. "Sounds... interesting. Though what would that entail?"\n"Well what do you damn think? An alliance means we swear to come to each other's aid if some dumb head-of-state decides to invade our lands, or if we invade theirs."\n"I asked what you mean because I don't usually sign 'treaties' unless it's about regular tribute payment."\n"We won't sign anything.

Will I be obliged to commit suicide by fighting alongside you?"\nRosa sighed. "Words are wind, so I guess not. But if it's a fair and even fight, I'd expect you to help if I asked you to.

longsword.174.t:0 "The Eastern Stream"
longsword.174.d:0 "There were hundreds of them, perhaps thousands. Just rows upon rows of ponies marching through the Longswordian-Lake City border. It seemed strange, absurd even. Beyond the fact that just a few years ago the border between the two states was fortified and shut and that there were never such a grand movement of ponies across these regions, the returning children of Vartai were... Strange, to say the absolute least. While all of them wore some indication of Vartai, or specifically regional Longswordian ancestry, usually religious symbolism, beyond that there was no single term one could use to describe them all. The ponies were dressed in everything from modern suits to mere rags.\n\n."From where in the depths of Tartarus did he dig all of them out?"Starry Swirl sighed, while filling out the form, as yet another pony left the booth after showing a pendent with the symbol of Varėnė and answering certain questions in a extremely broken ilgakardijan. "Maybe he found a mass grave or something." Cloud Eyes, the armed guard meant to protect the post from potential enemies and infiltrators jested, only to be answered with an eye roll. It was a rather popular theory for the longest time, that Abba Povner was some sort of warlock or magician, prominent in dark and forbidden magics. Of course such an idea was absurd, earth ponies couldn't become that powerful, could they? Besides...\n\nStarry Swirl's inner monologue was interrupted by a nudge to her side. She lifted up her from eyes from the list laying on the table. Somehow an entire group of ponies that looked like they stepped out of an ancient tapestry, had marched in front of the booth without her noticing it. All unicorn, they were covered in armour that would make even Longswordian Kings jealous in intricacy and level of craft. They looked at her, seemingly slightly irritated. The mare in charge made a statement of some sort, but while Starry could understand a couple words, it felt archaic, like the hymns that were sung in the alkavietės. She shot a gaze at Cloud Eyes, who seemed as confused as she was, before opening her mouth to ask the mare if she perhaps spoke Rijekan as her Ilgakardijan was clearly incomprehensible to normal ponies, only to be interrupted by an avenger who too, seemed to have appeared from thin air.\n\n"Write down Wittenland, I will fill out the rest later on." The stallion ordered, while leading the group of alleged longswordians from Wittenland away from the booth.\n\nAs the group left from their eye-sight, Cloud Eyes grinned at Starry Swirl, as if assuming that the absurdity of the scene that just occurred some sort of proof."

longsword.175.d:0 "Arklid lit up another cigarette with shaking hooves. It seemed absurd, insane, unreal even. Even in ones most fantastical dreams and most outlandish fantasies one wouldn't think to see such a sight. There were thousands of griffons, perhaps tens of thousands, it was difficult to determine as the camp seemed to be quite cramped and most of the force were perhaps resting. Though one thing was easily noticeable, many of them, perhaps all among their ranks, were knights, for all the griffons that darted among the tents and other establishments of the camp wore armour. Two things were quite notable and rather strange considering how such forces look usually, lack of any banners or other defining symbols, and the fact that all the pieces of armour seemed to be dirty or rusted, as if someone had dragged them or even kept them in mud. Though perhaps something like that was to be expected?\n\n"I assume the barracks of Visaginas can house three more divisions for now." Arklid turned to the side to see Abba Povner himself approaching with a substantial retinue of griffon knights, though perhaps such a term wasn't fitting anymore, for the troops following the pony looked quite... miserable and pathetic, compared to the Rosewood knights that Arklid had until now just assumed to be the average. Perhaps it was just the armour? After all the griffons themselves towered over Povner, and held themselves somewhat steady, even if it looked like they had been dragged through the dirt. Though considering the situation in the griffon parts of the continent, perhaps that was the case."Do not worry Comrade Povner, we will find enough place for your new... recruits? I must ask however, how many more are coming? And furthermore, not to sound insulting, but how can we trust foreign knights and griffons after everything..."\n\nArklid instantly regretted asking these questions, as while Povner didn't seem angry or irritated, his gaze felt uncomfortable and piercing. Perhaps as an answer Abba raised his hoof into the air and shouted. "Death to Imperials! Death to Herzland! Glory to Varėnė!"\n\nThe griffons behind him followed suit. And as their voices echoed across the valley, the griffons in the camp started shouting the words too. Soon, the screams for imperials and herzlanders to perish were so loud they were deafening. Whatever the Soldier of the Gods had done to these griffons, their fervour was so astounding Arklid could only watch in amazement as they pushed themselves into greater and greater frenzy with their screams."

longsword.176.d:0 "The meeting of the high command had ended long ago, yet still, a single light burned in the balcony of the von Tyzenhauzen. It was the light of a cigarette that belonged to a single stallion. However, the pony wasn't alone vigilant in the night, a griffon stood nearby, gazing at the far stars. It was a rather strange moment of peace for both the creatures in this rather peaceful night. A moment for personal weakness for both, as they could drop off the masks of stoicism and professionalism kept through the days.\n\n"They are like the rats that they accused the faithful of being. No matter how much they fight and how many of them die, they always rise as a new Empire." The ashes from the cigarette fell on the expensive pavement as Povner ranted."I wanted to wait, to prepare, but we don't have time! If we wait, the Herzland will just become stronger!"\n\n"Will and faith alone will not win this time either." Pliater bitterly spat out."There is no unit so elite and technology so advanced to bridge the gap. There can be no proper victory."\n\n"We need bodies... Always more bodies..." Povner lit up another cigarette."Does Varėnė want us to drown the enemy in the blood of the faithful?"\n\n"There are always other ways..." Pliater spat out. "Ways without honour or true sacrifice, the same ways that the Black Cloaks would have considered, poison, plague, assassination. Ways that blindly target everyone, not just the guilty. But in our situation... Not that we have the option."\n\n"We have... We can have the bodies... The poison... The ways to cut the head from the snake..." Abba left out a pained sigh. "Perhaps that's how Varėnė desires... To enact upon them the same brutalities they enacted and allowed to be enacted upon us..."\n\n"Varėnė does command blood for blood.... Perhaps it is the only way... If there is a way..." Pliater murmured out. He gazed up into the starry sky and was silent for a minute. "Justice and vengeance comes before honour."\n\n"There can be no honour if the faithful are extinguished...""

Their spirits might have been broken and more forgiving leaders, like Starry Night might have allowed the less radical and more utopian elements of the movement to simply disperse and return to their previous lives. But mercy died that day in Visaginas.\n\nAcross the entirety of Longsword and even beyond, the Kerštininkai struck. No matter how deep the hole into the which the followers and students of Golden Morning dug themselves into, there was no escape from the jagged claws of primordial divine justice. They were found, dragged out and executed. No chance to defend or justify themselves was given, for traitors didn't deserve such privileges. However, for many it was not enough. For Naujoji Griffonija were soldiers and each of them had slain several partisans and innocents. And thus, a more blood had to be spilled for true justice. Of course, even if Kerštininkai were ascendant with Povner being the leader of Longsword, the remaining Raudonieji and Baltieji were adamant that innocents, such as family members or those that didn't even participate in the coup attempts would not be harmed if they weren't dangerous and/or non-combatants.\n\nHowever they had forgotten one thing, something on which Naujoji Griffonija was quite content to act out and Kerštas remembered perfectly..."

Afraid that the Raudonieji, Kerštininkai, Povnerites or whatever they called themselves would be like the beasts that she  heard rumours about. They weren't, but it was worse. They demanded she convert to worshipping Varėnė, and when she refused, judged her guilty, proclaiming that she betrayed the gods and traditions of her ancestors and thus had to be punished and had to seek redemption. And thus she was locked up. She expected beatings or torture, like reformisten did it, yet nothing like that happened. In fact nothing would happen for days, even weeks. The guards would come to bring food and water, but they didn't talk, and their eyes were empty, gazing into unseen distances. The only contact and if one could call it and entertainment she was allowed, beyond reading the old religious texts and modern religious poetry left in her cell were the rituals performed by the vaidilos and sometimes, very rarely, speeches by the "Soldier of the Gods"- Abba Povner. Time had merged, days flashing by without notice, memories dulling.\n\nAnd then one day, as she was slowly going through a new book of hymns and poems, something changed. It was as if the mysteries of the worlds both mortal and beyond became apparent. She could see through the lies the Herzland griffons had forced into them. She could see the truth. Something rose from deep inside of her and broke out. Perhaps for the first time in as long as the imprisonment room had existed, it was filled with laughter.\n\nThe guard opened up the door as she continued laughing and looked into the cell.

His gaze stopped for a few seconds on a couple of knights who represented the converts that Povner had brought back from abroad, a contingent that one would assume wouldn't be composed of living or sane. For what griffon knight s would turn against the Empire of their liege creators without true divine intervention? Yet the engravings with the symbols of Blackhollow and Opinicus implied some did...\n\n"They will kill all of us now, won't they?" Someone commented in a raspy voice.

You can't be suggesting... Has the Povnerite madness not left your mind?!\n\n"I wish it didn't, at least there was solace in it.

It was a griffon in a Kerštininkai uniform indicating a substantial rank. Perhaps the highest remaining one, considering the losses experienced by the pacification battalions during both the Herzland campaign and especially after departure of Povner and the veil of mad righteousness being removed from their minds. The griffon seemed to not have expected such an attention, nervously grasping several folders that he was holding.\n\n"Be.. Before the war with Herzland started, comrade Povner had spent a long time preparing for every phase of the war, even what comes after."\n\n"A Povnerite plan for Herzland? We can't implement that! We could never forgive ourselves after!" Arklid protested\n\n"How many more would shoot themselves..." Pliater followed.\n\n"I can assure you comrades, as the last surviving creator of the plan, I took it upon myself to make it more acceptable and fitting towards our position." The kerštininkas handed two folders to Arklid and Ludwig and started moving across the room, handing out the rest to the remaining more sober members of the gathering.\n\nVon Pliater started flicking through the pages of the previously "Eternal Vengeance Plan" now titled "Morgenclaw Plan". The solution was still quite radical, perhaps fitting for one of the last officers of the Kraujo Kerštas, but there was a sort of totalitarian brilliance to it perhaps.\n\n"In any other case such a plan would be madness..."

Yet he persisted and started a new life in the city of Romau. He even created a family of his own. Yet the rumours about his alleged republican associations never subsided, and thus with Eyrite power growing and after several incidents with the Romau legion which indicated that neither he, nor his kin were welcomed in not just Romau, but all of Herzland. Thus, with help of some friends in Katerin, he fled to Longsword where he managed to become a minor clerk.\n\nHowever this didn't continue for long as Pallas Dusktalon, ever growing in his insanity decided to begin the Longsword bloodbath during which he struck both pony and griffon which he thought as impure. For some reason, Hans' family was targeted while he was on a mission in Katerin. Perhaps there was something that could have been done, but the civil war erupted right after. During it's flames his family perished and the Longsword he returned to after was nothing like before. With nothing left and feeling cursed wherever he goes, Hans contemplated suicide... And then he was shown the true way. The way of vengeance, the way of true justice, the way of the faith in which the divine cared for the mortal.\n\nAs Hans ordered the other Kerštininkai to open fire on alleged black cloak supporters, he couldn't stop himself from having a slight smirk. Joining Povnerites made him an accursed traitor and monster to many perhaps, he had heard accusations of being a bloodthirsty monster and nothing more than a thug, but Hans didn't care.

According to Visaginas prison reports, ever since his imprisonment and the destruction of the Naujoji Grifonija organization, he has grown increasingly hard to get a bead on. Moody and unpredictable, speaking of betrayal and apocalyptic visions, speaking in graphic detail of just how doomed Longsword and the entire continent are, as if he's had a religious awakening.\n\nStarry didn't get a chance to experience it personally, however. Whenever she arrived to visit, he was always silent and stoic, only occasionally speaking his heart out. Mysterious, yet charming.

As the voting and the formalities concluded, representatives of the Raudonieji and Baltieji factions have gathered in the halls of the merchant guilds in Swordsson to determine the role of the opposition from then on out.\n\n"I'm sure there is something we can figure out," Starry Night continued, earning a few raised eyebrows from the other side and getting Flawless Justice to immediately reply:\n\n"You've already gotten what you want, haven't you, Marshal Night? The Reds I've had the displeasure of talking to made it very clear that they see us merely as old geezers clinging onto a world that is supposedly never to return. If not evil landlords who should be sent to the gallows... So what is this about "working together" and "coalitions"?"\n\n"That's... simply not true," Starry defended herself. "You and your peers are Longswordian patriots too, and even under socialism, I have no qualms with listening to your advice. After all, you can provide skills which the rest of us severely lack.

And yet this young mare stood before her, the uniform she was conscripted to wear clearly too large for her, with such wonder in her mind. To the conscript's surprise, her famously nigh-psychotic commanding officer suddenly pulled her to a hug, before waving towards the sky with her hoof.\n\n"It will be beautiful, incredible... Like all of our desires and dreams come true!"\n\n"Dreams come true..?"\n\n"You remember the War of Liberation, correct?" The mere mention of the decade long guerrilla war got the conscript's voice to crack as she replied:\n\n"Yes, both of my parents got sent to Pallas' camps..."\n\n"Then picture a world where all of the resources dedicated to such atrocities were instead put where they're truly needed. We won't have to call ponies 'ponies', or griffons 'griffons', and murder one another on that stupid distinction alone. We will build hospitals instead of armories, theme parks instead of barbed wire, and... dream anything we want!"\n\nTruth be told, Šalna hardly knew any more of what the Vadeiva's ultimate designs were. He only consulted himself, after all.

These regions are by far the most influenced and defined by their Imperial past. Griffenheim is the rotten core of this disgusting ideal, as it's both the Imperial capital and the domain of the Archon of Boreas. Romau houses the Archon of Eyr who reforged the once shattered city into a manifestation of inherently Imperial and Herzlander ideal. Finally, Bronzehill, the dog loyalists of the Empire and perhaps the greatest hypocrites of them all. Despite their origins as slaves in Diamond Mountain, having a first hand experience at the same sort of corrupt and brutal spirit that manifested itself across the Empire, they not only accepted the gifts of Grover II, but also became the greatest supporters of the Empire.\n\nAll of these realms are rotten to the core. Thus, they are punished the worst. They are occupied by a military force of the faithful which ensure that they are stripped of their industrial and military ability so that they are not a threat to anyone ever again. They will be turned into fully agrarian states, for which land is provided, to allow their populace to persist, yet become isolated from any trade or foreign relations. Any remaining imperial loyalists and notable characters which evaded the first purges will be hunted down until none remain.\n\nThe core of the empire and rotten domains that embody their corrupting ideals will be punished - eternally."
LSC_reconstruction_authority:0 "Morgenclaw Plan - Main Provision 2"
LSC_reconstruction_authority_desc:0 "The second part of Morgenclaw plan concerns Northern and Southern Herzland. While Povner didn't see any difference between Herzlanders, arguing that all of them were corrupt and deserving to perish, with the reigns of leadership passing to Ludwig von Pliater and less radical characters, such a punishment became impossible due to both logistical ability and the dawning immorality of such an action. Furthermore, while there are domains which are corrupted by imperial ideals through and through, among the more distant regions you can find griffons that posses a different mentality, be it something completely opposing imperial ideals or simply nationalism and regionalism.\n\nThese regions will be punished just like the rest of the Herzlands, however this punishment will be lesser, more controlled. These regions will be demilitarized and pushed into more agrarian character all the same. But eventually, these "Reconstruction Authorities" will hopefully be turned into their own independent countries, free from corrupting legacy of the Herzland, putting that rotten nightmare to rest."

edgy_poser_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 24th of April, 958 in Swordsson\n\n§YRank§!: Count of Longsword\n\n§YBiography§!: The current head of the noble Dusktalon family, Pallas assumed leadership not long after the County of Longsword declared independence from the Griffonian Empire. At first, he was content to continue the proud Longswordian tradition, but everything changed when he came in contact with the growing group of knights who called themselves the Reformisten. Their ideology and way of thought completely changed Pallas, and he set forth to implement their policies in Longsword, which culminated in the current bloodshed against the ponies. His single minded zeal towards achieving purity in Longsword compensates for his lack of proper leadership qualities, resulting in a dangerous obsession for attaining his dream, at any cost.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
female_bat_tito_desc:0 "§YBorn:§L\nDecember 11th, 971\nVarėna Countryside, County of Longsword\n§YBiography:§L Starry Night never thought she'd be any more than a footnote in history.\n\nBorn a foal of a locksmith and a farmer in the forested Longswordian south, she had a rather simple and idyllic childhood, composed of monotonous farming, hunting, and studying her father's craft. Her village did note that she was rather bright, she taught herself how to read by studying the religious texts of the village's Arcturian priest, for example, but neither she nor her family ever imagined that she'd end up leading a country. Not long after Count Dusktalon's regime turned towards senseless bloodshed, however, swarms of Reformisten descended upon her village, intent to round up and murder everypony. Armed with her father's hunting rifle, the 20-year old Starry was the first to rise in resistance, helped the few survivors escape, and swore as she watched her burning home to vanquish the Count's murderous regime by her own hoof.\n\nShe became a member of the Longswordian Liberation Army and soon rose to command the Visaginas Partisan District, striking against the Count and his lackeys from the foliage of the forests like their ancestors had done for centuries. Fearless, rumored to be invincible by her enemies, and speaking of a bright future free of fear, free of death and free of want, Starry Night has inspired many over the years. Any member of the Partisan movement, no matter where their allegiances lie, holds deep respect for her. As fearless and intimidating Longsword's greatest heroine makes herself out to be, however, even years of lead have not eroded the plain mare she is underneath. She is compassionate towards her comrades, always willing to hear them out and staunchly idealistic, to the point where she seems impressionable at times. To her, the Partisan struggle is not just one of freedom - it is one of building a better, ideal future upon those foundations. The future which the Reformisten ripped out of her hooves.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
reasonable_guy_desc:0 "§YBorn:§L\nFebruary 3rd, 940\nHaarsingen, County of Longsword\n§YBiography:§L Ever since the era of the Crusades, the Silvertalon lineage gave their lives in the service of Longsword, and thus, as they believed, all of Griffonkind. Originally from Katerin, the ancestors of the family served in the retinue of Grover II, fighting in his numerous wars against the Riverponies - and when the great Emperor died, they retreated with the rest. Instead of returning to Katerin, however, they settled in what is today Longsword, and have served the County since then. Conrad Silvertalon is merely the last in a long tradition, a soldier from birth who followed the path of his father, fought in the eternal border conflict with the Riverponies, and achieved the rank of General he deserved.\n\nThe new Count, Pallas, was different. When he came to power, Conrad Silvertalon had only recently been promoted to General, and watched the young monarch assume his position with promise. And then, he was forced to stand back and watch the traditions he held dear be dismantled, and the fanatics from Hellquill storm across the Griffking to establish their new order of affairs. The general never held that much sympathy towards the ponies, but seeing them brutalized, radicalized, and Longsword run down by Pallas's leadership eventually broke his loyalties. Understanding that Count Pallas will only lead Longsword to ruin, he chose to resist, forming an anti-Reformisten kamarilla with Hochmeisterin Konrada Wavewing to set Longsword back towards the track it deserves to take.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
sad_knight_birb_desc:0 "§YBorn:§L\nDate unknown, around 950-960\nPossibly Haarsingen, County of Longsword\n§YBiography:§L The newest in a long line of Grand Masters of the Order of the Rosewood Spear, Konrada Wavewing has a lot of expectations to live up to. Alongside their peers to the north, the Knightly Order of Hellquill, the Rosewood Order had followed Grover II in the Crusades east and were granted lands in modern day Haarsingen as a result. Unlike Hellquill, however, they did not have a nation to call their own, instead working alongside the Dusktalon dynasty in the defense of the Frontier. When the latest Count of Longsword went mad, Wavewing chose to form the Kamarilla and conspired with General Conrad Silvertalon to overthrow him. It was the only breach of the knightly virtue of loyalty she allowed herself to make.\n\nThe creatures of Longsword are allowed to know very little about the Grand Mistress and her past - not that she knows much about it herself - but what they do know is that she is a presence to be feared. Not because she may be a bloodthirsty monster or a ruthless tyrant, but because her stoic demeanor and permanent scowl demand respect and freeze the heart of even the most hot-headed knight. In a world which turns increasingly chaotic and unjust, Wavewing sees herself as an anchor which can lead Longsword back to normalcy, if only she lives and breathes knightly virtue.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Kajko"
sad_knight_birb_desc2:0 "§YBorn:§L\nJune 21st, 961\nKaterin Principality\n§YBiography:§L Though born to the family of a musician in the eastern reaches of Katerin, deep within the Scheißwald, Konrada Wavewing did not get to enjoy the idyllic life for long. At a very young age, the chick was separated from her home and fell to the claws of the knights of Rosewood - there, deep within the halls of Palisander Castle, she and numerous other stolen chicks were tutored to become the next generation of Rosewood Knights. Through force, manipulation and magic, she forgot everything about her past life, received a new name, and, seemingly forever loyal to the Order, she began her training as a knight. Her virtue, loyalty and talent were beyond exceptional, and throughout the years, she rose through the ranks until she became the Grand Mistress of the Order itself.\n\nNot long after the Longsword Civil War, she was awoken to her true nature by a party of musicians from Katerin, and a song she heard during her childhood, which the Order never managed to erase from her memories. In a long path of self-discovery, her faith in the Order and the tradition she was supposed to defend was shaken, but Wavewing clung to the ideals she held dear, and which transcended past the duties of the Order. In time, the griff's demeanor began to change. Ever so often, her subjects can see a smile on her face, and the Rosewood Order has begun to scale down their control of Longsword's society.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Kajko"
lewd_event_star_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 15th of August, 982 in Zeltstadt\n\n§YBiography§!: Former second-in-command to Count Dusktalon, Rosa Heidenreich was one of his earliest supporters when he began spreading the Reformisten values through Longsword. It was her hard work and dedication that got her to this position, and although some would say Rosa had the Count's personal interest, she vehemently denies any of that and insists it was through merit alone. Regardless, having spent many nights ruminating on the failures of the Reformisten ideology, it wasn't a light decision for her to overthrow the Count after their victory in the civil war. She now leads the former Black Cloaks as a ruthless bandit leader, free of any previous trappings, and interested only in extracting riches from others.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
pagan_larper_desc:0 "§YBorn:§L\nJuly 19th, 960\nSwordsson, County of Longsword\n§YBiography:§L Flawless Justice was born with a silver spoon in his mouth, to a lineage of Longswordian Kings - the descendants of the Longswordian pony nobility which ruled the land before the Empire's invasion, and were allowed to keep some of their power and privileges under the House of Dusktalon. Flawless Justice himself claims to descend from the house of Grand Duke Žemaitukas himself, the last ruler of Longsword, who united the pony tribes under one nation and fought a futile resistance against Grover II. Though his descendants never forgot this humiliation, they bent to the conqueror and his puppet in Swordsson like all of their peers. As long as he were to continue to safeguard their rights and traditions.\n\nNot long after Flawless Justice finished education in Griffenheim and returned home, the Empire collapsed, Longsword broke free, and soon came under the bloody claw of Count Pallas and the Reformisten. All the contracts and pledges which the Longswordian Kings held towards the House of Dusktalon vanished overnight, and this privileged class was now hunted down like the rest. The young noble, like many of his peers, chose to resist, moving to the forests and joining the Longswordian Liberation Army. There, they formed the White Faction, fighting for a free, traditional, harmonious Longsword, a restoration of the idyllic past which once was.\n\nFar from humble, Flawless Justice only barely tolerated working with the commoners and peasants before, and he does even less so now, when they claim of a desire to move into politics and pursue their ideological goals. The Longsword he heard about from romantic tales was simple and harmonious - those with blue blood govern with compassion, those below work for the good of the community. And it cannot be any other way.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Twotail"
crazy_bosniak_fascist_desc:0 "§YBorn:§L\nOctober 4th, 976\nVisaginas Countryside, County of Longsword\n§YBiography:§L Being born to a village of Posniaks - ponies who converted to the Archonite faith and accepted griffon customs over centuries of cultural integration - did not save Golden Morning from a childhood of suffering. At a young age, he had to escape to the forests with a handful of survivors from his village, fleeing the Black Cloaks and their rampage - the image of senseless slaughter, death, and an end to the peace he knew his whole life remained imprinted in his mind for long. Before Morning could starve to death far away from civilization, he was rescued by a small group of partisans led by Starry Night, an officer recently inducted into the Longsword Liberation Army. Lacking any option, he joined the IIA, becoming an officer himself and developing a close personal relationship with the mare who would eventually become Longsword's greatest heroine. Ferocious, determined, and lacking a sense of self-preservation, Morning gained the trust of his fellow Partisans as a loyal and competent commander.\n\nHis heart never found reprieve, however. What do creatures find in war, what pushes them to murder each other senselessly, eradicate their fellow creatures just because of their species, and achieve nothing but loss to all? His broken mind began to speak back to him - and it informed him that time is growing scarce. Griffonia, divided between two worlds, East and West, has always been at its own throats, these two worlds have always fought, but if this wheel of time continues any further, the end of the world as we know it will come. Only Longsword has the potential to put an end to this agony - here, in the forests of the Frontier, ponies and griffons managed to co-exist and create a super-culture, one which borrows superior traits from the griffons and Riverponies alike. This super-culture has a destiny to expand to encompass all of Griffonia - or die trying, and so watch the continent decay into nothing.\n\nA circle of followers gathered around Morning, the "Naujoji Grifonija" ("New Griffonia") movement, the first entity somewhat resembling a political party on Longswordian soil - and it shall stop at no sacrifice to achieve Longsword's prophetic destiny.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: bunnyshrubby"

6_million_imperials_desc:0 "§G[ACCESS GRANTED]§!\n\n§LEven among all the eccentric and strange figures which were born from the circumstances created by the brutal regime of Count Pallas and his Reformisten supporters, Abba Povner is an exception.\n\nAccording to comrade Starry Night and Povner himself, Abba was but another rural pony youth who sometimes dabbled in poetry and religious literature, who was later on inspired to take up arms against the Black Cloak regime in defence of this faith and in order to avenge the fallen faithful. He then rose through the ranks, becoming one of the most recognized members of the IIA due to both his skill with a rifle and command ability. However there are claims and rumors spreading around the ponies and griffons of Longsword that there is far more to Povner than simply some religious partisan... Some of the older guerrillas claim that Povner has to be a some sort of phantom, for he appeared out of nowhere one day, already a military leader with a following of religious zealots and repenters, that they had never seen or heard of anyone like this. Others claim that he is surely not a pony, at least not a living one, for they have seen him slain a dozen times, by bullet or by blade, and yet still persisting in the mortal world. Yet others claim that he cannot be hurt, for no bullet or blade can penetrate his hide. There are even claims that Povner has mystical powers more comparable to the precognitive abilities of the deer seers, than anything like pony magic.\n\nWhile Starry Night dismisses any such rumors, both Povner's most devout followers and greatest enemies believe them fully. But while the pony zealots and griffon converts that follow Abba claim that these are divine blessings, be it from Varėnė or lesser regional divinities, and that he is truly the soldier of the gods, his enemies claim that Abba is a practitioner of forbidden, dark magics or even necromancy, which he uses to cheat death and subjugate the minds of others. Of course, none of them dare to make such claims to him in person.\n\nHowever, while his past is shrouded in mystery and even his present is questioned by both friend and enemy alike, if Povner's own claims are anything to go by, the future is set in stone. The black cloaks... the griffon supremacists that allowed them to rise... the accursed Imperials whose doctrines led to their creation... they will pay for each and every Longswordian faithful that they killed."
commie_knight_desc:0 "Originally from the Principality of Lushi, Ludwig von Pliater grew up hearing stories about the gallant griffon knights and dreaming about becoming one himself. Due to these fantasies he eventually traveled to Longsword in order to join the crusade against what he then believed to be a threat to griffonkind. However, instead of a righteous knightly campaign in the name of Arcturius, Ludwig would only find a massacre of innocents by the mad Reformisten. In such a position, the idealist made a choice. He deserted from the knightly order and joined the partisans to fight against such injustice. Years of fighting the Black Cloaks have changed Ludwig, shattering his idealism and faith in griffon divinities. However his determination and ferocity are even greater than before as the vow to the goddess Varėnė, to avenge all the innocents slain, pushes him forward."
edgy_commie_boye_desc:0 "Lite was born in the distant East in 982 ALB, and had a tough life - losing his parents at young age caused him to live his childhood in an orphanage, only to be captured by the Barrad Pentarchy in the age of 13. Prior to his escape, he was experimented on in painful ways, causing him to develop enormous wings. The road to Longsword was indeed long and sword-related - he would have to fight his way to the country where he thought he would be safe from the chase. A lot of forest combat and in-chase tactics left him quite experienced in both by the time he finally arrived in Longsword, where his wounded, malnourished, exhausted body was picked up by pony resistance - he was actually planning on moving forward (which turned out to be north-west) but he was just too weak to go further. There he would heal up, learn how to live in society and showed surprising experience in forest tactics and planning which he learned during his captivity and escape, which gave him a reputation as a talented leader in the Longswordian Liberation Army. During the Longswordian Civil War he rose up with the rest of the ponies and griffon for the victory of Communism and achieving his dream - a world where no creature would be suppressed like Longswordian ponies once were."
yan_pony_partisan_desc:0 "Nakties Šalna was born a peasant in southern Longsword, and her first step towards a military career was no different from many of her comrades - in the form of a Reformisten raiding party designating her village as a killzone and opening fire. In the midst of chaos, fire and death, the seven year old mare was taken from her home by her uncle and carried to safety in the forests. The visage of bloodthirsty, black-cloaked Griffons burning everything in sight was imprinted in her mind, even if she was too young to understand what's happening at the time. The event left Šalna without purpose - her family was dead and her farm was gone; and it left her questioning the world and the idyllic life she used to have. Lacking any other options, she grew up alongside the Partisans and trained to become a warrior in her own right.\n\nIn the Longswordian Liberation Army, Šalna was assigned to Golden Morning's squad and quickly grew attached to him. In the future leader of Naujoji Grifonija, she found everything she needed - an ideology to fill the void in her heart, a strong and mysterious stallion to learn more about, and a charismatic speaker who could convince her to do anything. Šalna became one of his followers, but her relationship towards him went far deeper than anyone else - it devolved into mania, psychotic mania, a fervent desire to get Morning to pay attention to her and solely to her, even as the stallion was clearly more interested in someone else. Lacking any other way to channel her emotions, she turned even more towards the art of war, gaining a reputation as a psychotic soldier who eschews any value to her life if it means the Vadeiva will give her a glance."

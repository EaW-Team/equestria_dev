### Ideas ###
LNS_race_war:0 "The Longswordian Bloodbath"
LNS_race_war_desc:0 "More formally known to outside observers as the Longswordian Genocide, this horrendous deed against Ponykind and common decency is being carried out by the hated Count Pallas Dusktalon and his Reformisten allies.\n\nThankfully not everyone within Longsword is willing to simply allow the Count to go through with his plan, as both elements of the military and Pony Partisans have intensified their efforts at stopping the mad Count."
LNS_killed_officers:0 "Dead Griffons Tell No Tales"
LNS_killed_officers_desc:0 "The Reformisten officer's incompetence has made them easy targets for those who don't particularly agree with their view of things. The ending result has been numerous counts of them ending up dead in outright assassinations or "accidents." It goes without saying that replacing officers isn't easy and a lack of them does tend to muddle a military's efficiency..."
LNS_sabotaged_industry:0 "Sabotaged Industry"
LNS_sabotaged_industry_desc:0 "The factories contain blunt signs of continuous sabotage conducted by the resistance elements."
LNS_civil_war:0 "The Longswordian Civil War"
LNS_civil_war_desc:0 "It seems the ponies of Longsword were rather unwilling to simply let the Griffons kill them all and have risen up in arms, united by their communist ideals. Meanwhile officers in the army have organized their own resistance, intending to overthrow the bloodthirsty Count while also preventing the rebellious ponies from taking over the country."
LNS_final_push_idea:0 "The Final Push"
LNS_final_push_idea_desc:0 "It has been a painful conflict for all involved. But the final battle lines and plans have been drawn and the troops have been rallied for the final assault. One last push is all it'll take to bring this terrible Civil War to a lasting peace; forward!"
LNS_two_peoples_idea:0 "Two Cultures"
LNS_two_peoples_idea_desc:0 "The Two Cultures of Longsword have finally been united in harmony. Griffons and Ponies both maintain equal rights in every form, from working to beliefs and even freedom of marriage. While most are ecstatic and pleased at this conclusion - there still remains a slight minority of ponies who maintain their own social identity that still goes unrecognised officially by the government. While these dissidents may not take up arms, they will forever be spurned by the movement for its failure to recognise them outright."
LNS_three_peoples_idea:0 "Three Cultures"
LNS_three_peoples_idea_desc:0 "The Three Cultures of Longsword have for the first time in history been properly recognised and fully acknowledged in the eyes of the state. For as long as anyone could remember, Ponies and Griffons were the only notable "ethnics" of the state. The hidden third minority; the Posniaks had long gone with not a hint of notice from even their own pony cousins. Thanks to the victorious Communist movement, this small minority has finally achieved its greatest desire - social acceptance and recognition of its very existence. While this once troublesome group rejoices and pledges support for the government, it'll need to be given special administrative attention in the coming future just like the ponies and griffons are entitled to."
LNS_powerful_passport_idea:0 "Griffonia's Most Powerful Passport"
LNS_powerful_passport_idea_desc:0 "With SRL's brand of Communism firmly established and the population at ease, it's time to establish ourselves as the safest gateway between the Eastern Pony-Dominated woodlands of Griffonia and the Western War ravaged lands of Griffon-Dominated Griffonia. For decades it has been supremely difficult to secure safe passageway from East to West and vice versa, but our geographical position allows us to successfully exploit our stability and bring on traders and migrants from all over the continent to filter through our territory! Bringing with them all kinds of exotic and luxury goods..."
LNS_industrial_education_idea:0 "Haarsingen Mechanical Institute"
LNS_industrial_education_idea_desc:0 "Part of ensuring a sound future for the SRL and its continued industrial growth requires the education system to give preliminary courses on common tool use, maintenance, and even manufacturing when viable. A population educated in the basics of industry will set the foundation for a more industrialised tomorrow as the public and private sectors will have the know how to pursue their interests in the field."
LNS_state_services_idea:0 "State Services"
LNS_state_services_idea_desc:0 "Due to the socialist approach of the government, citizens of the nation enjoy a high agree of state sponsored and funded services ranging from free healthcare, unemployment support, and maternal leave."
LNS_controlled_unions:0 "State Controlled Unions"
LNS_controlled_unions_desc:0 "By controlling any Unions created by the working class, we can eliminate inefficienct use of state resources and also ensure construction projects aren't marred by safety procedures and limited work hours. Though, the workers themselves won't exactly be nearly as productive knowing their representation is severely limited!"
LNS_free_unions:0 "Autonomous Unions"
LNS_free_unions_desc:0 "Allowing the creation of Workers' Unions freely will ensure the loyalty and well being of workers, as well as helping to increase productivity and happiness all around. However, construction projects will be hampered by Union threats continuously, and no doubt state resources will be misused now and again under the nose of the law."
LNS_secret_services_idea:0 "Vidaus Saugumo Agentūra"
LNS_secret_services_idea_desc:0 "The VSA was secretly established early on in the revolution to initially inspect the ranks and root out possible Reformisten informants and spies as well as conduct military tribunals on troops who'd committed criminal activity after victorious operations. After the war the VSA turned over into an officially listed operational arm of the government to handle all forms of national security such as interior intelligence defense, upper law enforcement, and political correctness."
LNS_internationalism_idea:0 "Internationalism"
LNS_internationalism_idea_desc:0 "Even if Longswordian Communism lacks the fanatical and murderous zeal of other fellow Socialist Republics, there is still no excuse to not be involved in the protection of fellow foreign socialists fighting for their rights as sentient beings and as sovereign citizens in their respective nations. The Longsword Socialist Republic must pursue Internationalism, it is a baseline belief of Communism afterall!"
LNS_proper_army_idea:0 "A Proper IRA"
LNS_proper_army_idea_desc:0 "While the partisans served the cause spectacularly during the revolution and there's little reason to believe the war could've been won without them, they are still undisciplined and poorly trained rabble. For our national identity and sake of integrity the army must tighten its recruiting requirements and properly break down troops into organized units. How can we ever hope to fight another country with a citizen militia?"
LNS_partisan_legacy_idea:0 "A Partisan IRA"
LNS_partisan_legacy_idea_desc:0 "The partisans could be said to have saved this nation's citizens and with the valour they showed against impossible odds it is only fitting they make up the members of our new military. While perhaps not the best disciplined or organized, their morale is stronger and in the event of another defensive war our military will have even better experience in guerilla warfare against invaders. Not to mention, looser recruitment requirements will of course lead to a larger army..."
LNS_healing_spells_idea:0 "Mandatory Healing Magic Training"
LNS_healing_spells_idea_desc:0 "Every unicorn has undergone training to heal troops in combat situations."
LNS_proper_officer_school_idea:0 "Varėna Military Institute"
LNS_proper_officer_school_idea_desc:0 "Varėna was one of the centres for the revolution and served to be the strongest point of resistance against the Reformisten. The time has come for a proper officer academy to rise and help to create a new generation of intelligent citizens which will lead our troops into the wars of tomorrow."
LNS_plane_factory_idea:0 "Kupiškis Institute of Aviation"
LNS_plane_factory_idea_desc:0 "The war of air is the war of tomorrow. We cannot afford to ignore this new field of warfare nor can we afford aircraft at all! Having production centers specialised in aircraft fabrication will help lower the cost of these new death machines."
LNS_military_education_idea:0 "OMA Program"
LNS_military_education_idea_desc:0 "The Obligatorisches Militärisches Bildungsprogramm (Mandatory Military Training Program) aims to ensure the able-bodied part of the population is ready for reserve duty in the case of war. Effectively a basic military training draft for all adult and young adult citizens to help solve service member shortages in any future war."
LNS_a_gun_in_every_home_idea:0 "A Gun In Every Home"
LNS_a_gun_in_every_home_idea_desc:0 "What hurt the revolution most was a lack of firearms in the hands of well meaning citizens. In order to prevent a new oppressive government from ever taking hold, as well as convince foreign powers to not dare invade... It has become an interest to make weapons easier to acquire. An armed society is a polite society."
LNS_lessons_of_the_partisans_idea:0 "Lessons of the Partisans"
LNS_lessons_of_the_partisans_idea_desc:0 "The partisans went far outside the rules of warfare. Hit and run attacks, sabotage, other otherwise "dirty" tactics. We shall embrace these "cowardly" tactics and employ the former rebels into teaching us their methods. It's time we took these lessons into account and ensured they are used well."
LNS_military_pensions:0 "Ruhegehalt"
LNS_military_pensions_desc:0 "Ruhegehalt refers to the wide-scale benefits citizens receive upon retiring in the nation... Or if you're a notable member of the military, this is received particularly early on in life due to the prestige of serving the state directly!"
LNS_military_police_idea:0 "Militärpolizei"
LNS_military_police_idea_desc:0 "Formerly the Police Force was comprised of civilians and ex-military personnel. Due to this there'd always be a high chance of gross unprofessionalism amongst Police Officers, with the military in control the Police will also be directly affiliated with the army. Such affiliations include harsher training and indoctrination, but the second part isn't important!"
LNS_pure_army_idea:0 "A Griffon Army"
LNS_pure_army_idea_desc:0 "Griffons have always been far more adept for war than ponies. Griffons are omnivores, have natural defenses, worse attitudes, and are cheaper to produce weapons for than ponies. It's a no brainer that Griffons should make up the core - if not the entirety of the military."
LNS_mixed_army_idea:0 "A Mixed Army"
LNS_mixed_army_idea_desc:0 "Despite the herbivore nature of ponies they've always been privy to ingenuity and some even can use magic! Despite the challenges faced with arming equines, it'd be in our best interests to exploit the strengths BOTH Griffons and Ponies each possess."
LNS_spec_ops_idea:0 "BFSD"
LNS_spec_ops_idea_desc:0 "Die Büro Für Strategische Dienstleistungen (Office for Strategic Services) will serve as the center for all citizens gifted in the art of... Well, murder. It's a cruel reality that not everyone is equal, in that regard it's important to have an arm of the government dedicated to rounding up these... special individuals and training them."
LNS_blitzkrieg_idea:0 "Blitzkrieg!"
LNS_blitzkrieg_idea_desc:0 "The future of war is on wheel and track, not hoof and paw. The sooner we come to understand this new reality, the better we'll fair against other countries in eventual conflict. Even if we can't afford a vehicle supported military, it'll pay off to have the troops used to mobile warfare."
LNS_bureaucratic_collapse:0 "Collapsed Bureaucracy"
LNS_bureaucratic_collapse_desc:0 "Perhaps it wasn't the best idea to swap out the established bureaucracy with our own members..."
LNS_anarchy:0 "Anarchy"
LNS_anarchy_desc:0 "The police have stopped functioning, taxes aren't being paid, the Hinterlands are killing fields, employment is a foreign concept, and our currency is worth dirt... We really dropped the ball here, didn't we?"
LNS_bandit_state:0 "A Bandit State"
LNS_bandit_state_desc:0 "The economy has crashed, internal production is almost non-existent, and quality of life doesn't exist. Longsword is nothing more than a war-torn country which depends on raiding its neighbors to sustain itself."
LNS_opium_fields:0 "The Opium Fields"
LNS_opium_fields_desc:0 "Okay okay, the solution to our economic problem is we've got nothing anyone wants! Answer to that? Drugs. We'll produce lots and lots of drugs... Because nobody can resist Longsword grown opium! They'll smoke it to their grave, even. Bam, economy saved!"
LNS_meatshields:0 "Slavery"
LNS_meatshields_desc:0 "Right, so nobody wants to enlist anyone and everyone who did is probably dead by now or already recruited. Say, we've got all the guns right? What's stopping us from just taking "them" and putting them to work where needed?"
LNS_meatshields_1:0 "Slavery"
LNS_meatshields_1_desc:0 "Okay we've got all the slaves we need now, time to put them to the mines or shooting anything we point at."
LNS_personal_armies_idea:0 "Personal Armies"
LNS_personal_armies_idea_desc:0 "Due to the fact there's no law nor Police... anyone who's anybody has taken to recruiting their own militias and even armies if they can afford it. The service sector of jobs is long gone, everyone's a soldier now."
LNS_hit_and_run_idea:0 "Hit and Run"
LNS_hit_and_run_idea_desc:0 "Our equipment is awful and we can barely produce anything new. We're going to need to be faster than our prey considering we'll need to be picking the battlefields, so they'll always be in our favor."
LNS_baggae_idea:0 "Baggage Trains"
LNS_baggae_idea_desc:0 "Considering we don't have a central Military Headquarters, the troops and their slaves will simply take everything with them while they move. The army doesn't defend anything anymore, anyway."
LNS_ace_fighters_idea:0 "The Black Dozens"
LNS_ace_fighters_idea_desc:0 "The only ones able to fly aircraft buy em' themselves, or are gifted to them. Considering that criteria exclusively consists of only those with a passion for flying... Well, they're going to be damn good at it then. It's their passion!"
LNS_napalm_idea:0 "Firebombers"
LNS_napalm_idea_desc:0 "Ah, napalm... A wonderous new invention. Easy to produce, easy to use, most would call for it to be outlawed buuut... We don't have laws! So bonus for us, then."

LNS_our_friends_in_hellquill_desc:0 "We're ready to receive support from our comrades in Hellquill, but first, a group of volunteers must pass through the town of Kupiškis to reach Beakstadt. The Reformisten's influence is weak there, but that doesn't mean we're completely safe from harm."
LNS_target_collaborators:0 "Target the Collaborators"

LNS_hasty_militias:0 "Reformisten Fanatics"
LNS_hasty_militias_desc:0 "Murderers, thugs, fanatics and zealots would normally not be considered for joining our regular forces, but times are hard and we need every willing griffon to beat back the ponies. Additionally, small numbers of volunteers have arrived from Hellquill to assist us."

LNS_two_peoples_desc:0 "It is an eternal fact that two cultures have existed in Longsword as long as anyone could remember; griffons and ponies.

LNS_cement_party_desc:0 "We've won the war but that does not mean the party is well known throughout Longsword.

LNS_partisan_legacy:0 "The Legacy of the Partisans"
LNS_partisan_legacy_desc:0 "We cannot simply discard our military legacy and what we learned during the long decades of resistance just like that.

LNS_mobile_army_desc:0 "During the war of liberation our army didn’t posses anything that could hit the enemy quickly and with enough power to break them.

If one wishes to avoid pointless bloodshed they should strike fast and with a great amount of force. "
LNS_trucks:0 "Infantry Motorisation"
LNS_trucks_desc:0 "The future of warfare isn't on hoof or paw, but instead on wheel or track. If we want to have any chance in a coming conflict we must adapt and begin creating our own truck designs or... importing them from beyond our borders. For the good of the country!"

LNS_tank_destroyers:0 "The Marshal Night Tank"

LNS_a_pleasant_evening_desc:0 "Heidenreich has been planning on inviting Eriviar for a visit in a long time, but the ongoing anarchy made that difficult. Now that things are relatively stable, we shall prepare a festival for the visiting monarch! Among other things Heidenreich has in mind..."

LNS_massive_drug_fields:0 "The Opium Fields"
LNS_massive_drug_fields_desc:0 "Regular agriculture takes too long to return its investment. Instead, we'll set up plantations full of drugs! Hedonistic griffons in the Heartlands and beyond pay a pretty coin for them, and we can't let this opportunity slip by our claws."

LNS_into_the_mines_desc:0 "It's not enough to just force griffons to serve in our private armies, but we need to have them work in our mines, too. That iron won't dig up by itself, and Boreas knows we need a lot of it for our rifles..."

LNS_organ_donors:0 "Organ Donors"
LNS_organ_donors_desc:0 "They say life is the most precious commodity, and many griffons or ponies would pay dearly to preserve it. How do we turn this in our favour for profit?

LNS_we_are_rich_desc:0 "Some of us had doubts, but Rosa's rulership has been nothing except an astounding success. If we knew it would be this easy to become rich, we would have gotten ridden of the Count years ago! Our wealth now allows us to increase our nation's standing even more, improving our living standards... If you're one of the bandits, that is. The rest should just be grateful we didn't shoot them. Praise Rosa Heidenreich!"
LNS_legalize_poverty:0 "Deal With the Impoverished"
LNS_legalize_poverty_desc:0 "The poverty in this nation wouldn't be so bad if these lazy griffons got off their rears and started working for a change.

LNS_friendship_is_banditry_desc:0 "Unsurprisingly, there are many who'd want to wipe us off the map. We should look into fortifying our holdings, ensure that anyone invading us has a hard time. We may be bandits, but we're still hardened soldiers and we won't give up so easily."
LNS_girls_night_out:0 "Alcohol Smuggling"
LNS_girls_night_out_desc:0 "With the ongoing political situation across the entire Griffonia, it's no surprise griffons and ponies turn to the bottle for comfort.

It would be prudent to secure the safety of our runners."
LNS_smuggling:0 "The Cigar Trade"
LNS_smuggling_desc:0 "Following the success of our liquour scheme, we've decided to expand our capacities on producing cigars, as well.

But more importantly, all sorts of useful materials can be obtained from hunting animals, such as furs, leathers and much more. These things would be very useful for our soldiers, not to mention the potential sale value. It's not like we care about endangered species, either."
LNS_arms_trade:0 "The Arms Trade"
LNS_arms_trade_desc:0 "There is honour among thieves, certainly, and this has resulted in us making a deal with the other, similarly structured states across Griffonia. By exchanging whatever modern firearm models we come across, we can ensure we're a step ahead of our victims, and continue lining our pockets with plunder. Of course, we'll require some additional factories to produce these new weapons."
LNS_split_lushi:0 "Take Lushian Assets"
LNS_split_lushi_desc:0 "The poncy nobles down in Lushi are known to be filthy rich. We should deprive them of their wealth! Given their political bickering, we'll be plundering the vaults of Lumium in a week."

LNS_bandit_army:0 "An Army of Bandits"
LNS_bandit_army_desc:0 ""Listen up, you thugs. If we're going to be rich, you're going to follow my way - disobey me and your body will be in the river by the next hour. Now get your rears to the training grounds.""
LNS_get_guns:0 "Arm the Bands"
LNS_get_guns_desc:0 ""If you don't own a rifle, you're worthless to me. Find a gun, don't care how you do it, and then get back to me. How do you plan on stealing anything if you don't have a way of protecting yourself?""
LNS_basic_artillery:0 "Bandits With Cannons"
LNS_basic_artillery_desc:0 "It's hard to make a living when our victims hide behind forts and walls. Some improved artillery models should enable us to get back on track. Enemies will cower once they hear the sound of our cannons!"
LNS_pull_out_shovels:0 "Paymasters"
LNS_pull_out_shovels_desc:0 "Scouts, engineers, repairgriffs - we've got them all, but they insist on a special deal if they were to serve us. In exchange for personally paying their subordinates, they want full control of their companies and a cut of the loot. As this suits our overall military strategy, we've agreed to their terms. Support companies are invaluable on the field, after all."
LNS_organize_warbands:0 "Organise the Warbands"
LNS_organize_warbands_desc:0 "We've got a lot of griffons eager to join us, but they see themselves as one griff armies, believing they're invincible just because they have a gun. Some proper organisation will go a long way in making sure we get the most plunder out of each raid, with nobody squabbling over their share."
LNS_appoint_leaders:0 "New Talent"
LNS_appoint_leaders_desc:0 "After the anarchy, we've been left with barely any capable commanders for leading our forces. However, some of the raid leaders have proven themselves skilled, and it would be a shame to have their talent go to waste. Heidenreich will personally promote this new blood."
LNS_personal_armies:0 "Personal Armies"
LNS_personal_armies_desc:0 "With lawlessness and anarchy being the usual state of affairs in Longsword these days, it's no surprise the population has resorted to hiring personal militias and protection squadrons, to protect what little they have. We can use this to our advantage, as well, to complement our forces."
LNS_new_tactics:0 "New Formations"
LNS_new_tactics_desc:0 "Our foes fight in disciplined formations and use modern warfare doctrines, so why shouldn't we? We can't expect the prey to just give up their livelihoods, so instead we'll have to work on our tactics, to ensure the best chance of success in the field."
LNS_hit_and_run:0 "Hit and Run Tactics"
LNS_hit_and_run_desc:0 "Most of our griffons are simply not disciplined enough to maintain their battle positions. Incompetence or cowardice, it matters not, for we'll train our armies to continuously harass our victims before retreating, wearing them down. This cycle of pain will continue until they all die, or surrender."
LNS_tank_raiding_brigade:0 "Bandits With Tanks"
LNS_tank_raiding_brigade_desc:0 "Trucks and other similar vehicles make a great getaway option for our warbands, but they're vulnerable against small arms fire. However, if we were to adopt what they call "tank" in the Heartlands, we'd have our protection and a new way to spread terror on our raids."
LNS_baggage:0 "Baggage Slaves"
LNS_baggage_desc:0 "Organising a proper logistical team isn't an option, between all our autonomous, single objective focused armies. Who'd be able to properly supply them, when they're scattered across all directions? Instead, we'll allow the commanders to assign some of the slaves as pack mules, ensuring they are supplied well wherever they go."
LNS_the_apocalypse:0 "Despoiler Brigades"
LNS_the_apocalypse_desc:0 "Now that we've applied the lessons of modern warfare to our raids, it is time to create special divisions, who will be trained specifically in inflicting as much devastation as they can on our prey. Who said banditry didn't pay off? These griffons will steal anything that isn't bolted to the ground."

LNS_bandit_airforce:0 "Bandits In Planes"
LNS_bandit_airforce_desc:0 "The predator lies high on the food chain, and who's more dangerous than us? If we were to invest in creating and maintaining an airforce, it would ensure our dominance over our victims... Not to mention raiding would go much quicker from these flying machines."
LNS_fighters:0 "A Pair of Claws"
LNS_fighters_desc:0 "Quick, agile, capable of taking on any plane - the bandits love these fighter planes. Our self-funded pilots have been pressing us to adopt newest fighter designs across the entire nation, so we can have control of the skies at all times."
LNS_heavier_fighters:0 "Talons of Steel"
LNS_heavier_fighters_desc:0 "Despite their agility, regular fighters are somewhat frail and require a lot of skill to properly pilot. A more heavier fighter model will be the solution to our problems in maintaining air superiority, and they'll be able to protect our other planes better, as well."
LNS_airfields:0 "The Zeldstadt Airfields"
LNS_airfields_desc:0 "Those flygriffs have been begging us to build airfields for months. We've decided to grant their request, if only because we've realised the importance of planes in today's warfare. Not to mention, raider groups would have more realiable support."
LNS_our_own_doctrine:0 "Altitude Training"
LNS_our_own_doctrine_desc:0 "We've got many volunteers for our air forces, but very few possess the optimal training to handle flying. Our few experienced pilots will be assigned to train as many as they can, developing the beginning of our air doctrine at the same time."
LNS_close_air_support:0 "Up Close and Personal"
LNS_close_air_support_desc:0 "Machine guns and bombs are the ideal instruments of killing, but they're hard to get in proper range on the battlefield. Instead, we'll adapt a fighter model to be more efficient in providing ground support for our forces."
LNS_further_developments:0 "Flight Training Programs"
LNS_further_developments_desc:0 "The initial efforts have paid off, with more and more griffons flocking to become a pilot. The initial wave of recruits have shown promise in handling airplanes, as well, which marks the formation of a professional airforce. Soon enough, our victims won't know what hit 'em!"
LNS_bombers:0 "Explosive Eggs"
LNS_bombers_desc:0 "Explosions! Who doesn't love explosions? Our prey certainly won't once we unveil our new bomber planes, designed to inflict maximum damage on their lands and units..."
LNS_strategic_bombers:0 "Steel Shells"
LNS_strategic_bombers_desc:0 "Conventional bombing does the job well against regular forces, but they don't have the reach or protection to properly assault enemy cities and fortifications. We'll build the biggest, hardest hitting, highest flying bomber yet! Our victims will know their livelihoods are forfeit once these start bombing..."
LNS_ace_fighters:0 "The Black Dozens"
LNS_ace_fighters_desc:0 "Surprisingly, our intense training program has resulted in a formation of a dedicated, passionate group of pilots. Trained in unconventional tactics, they'll be our claws in the sky, striking down any enemy plane, at day or night... Sharing their valuable experience with the other, less trained pilots, as well."
LNS_napalm:0 "Firebombing"
LNS_napalm_desc:0 "Napalm has been denounced as a savage weapon by the civilised western nations, but we hold no such compulsions. If it helps us secure our loot, we'll do it - perhaps our targets will stop resisting so fiercely once they see their precious cities and fields burning..."
LNS_jet_experiments:0 "Bandits With Rockets"
LNS_jet_experiments_desc:0 "Would you look at that? These new rockets leave the current planes in the dust. We should expand our investment in these rockets, they'll give us the most fastest and dangerous weapons in the sky."

LNS_military_victory:0 "Restoration of Order"
LNS_military_victory_desc:0 "Dusktalon may have been deposed, but the country is still wracked and ruined by the years of devastation the Reformisten inflicted on it in their savage goal. We must quickly reassure our people that they have nothing to fear anymore."
LNS_cement_our_rule:0 "Establishing Our Government"
LNS_cement_our_rule_desc:0 "The first order is business is to set up a working, functional government. What existed before was little before than Dusktalon's cronyism on a massive scale, and it showed by their chronic incompetence."
LNS_educate_the_people_military:0 "Education for the Masses"
LNS_educate_the_people_military_desc:0 "Education has been a scarce luxury for a long time in Longsword, mainly because of the Refomisten's seizure of all education material they deemed "corrupted by ponies", which is to say, almost all of them. Schools and libraries will be reopened, and the population will be encouraged to educate themselves."
LNS_address_the_poverty:0 "Help the Impoverished"
LNS_address_the_poverty_desc:0 "For years, the high taxes forced upon by the Reformisten have left the commonfolk with little more than the clothes on their backs. If we are to have a proper, working nation, the chronic poverty must be adressed through welfare and public works programs."
LNS_status_of_the_ponies_politically:0 "The Rights of Ponies"
LNS_status_of_the_ponies_politically_desc:0 "Ponies shall not be discriminated and hated against anymore! Our laws will be immediately updated to reflect the forming of a new, tolerant society, in which both ponies and griffons can have the same rights and privileges."
LNS_status_of_ponies_as_advisors:0 "Invite Ponies to the Government"
LNS_status_of_ponies_as_advisors_desc:0 "There are many capable, skilled ponies in our country, and it would be a loss for us if we were to disregard their capabilities. To improve the functioning of our nation, and to heal the wounds from the recent bloodshedding, the best and brightest will be invited to work for our government."
LNS_land_distribution_to_veterans:0 "Reward the Veterans"
LNS_land_distribution_to_veterans_desc:0 "Those who have risked their lives and more for Longsword shall be properly rewarded, with a sufficient amount of land to sustain themselves. Hopefully, this will also entice more citizens to join our forces, knowing that they will be rewarded at the end of their service."
LNS_connect_the_nation:0 "The Longsword Highway"
LNS_connect_the_nation_desc:0 "The infrastructure has been in a sad state for a long time, between Reformisten negligence and Partisan sabotage. This changes now, and all of Longsword will be properly connected once more."
LNS_industrial_effort:0 "Begin Industrialisation"
LNS_industrial_effort_desc:0 "While military is a highly important part of our society, of course, we cannot live on bayonets and rifles alone. We shall begin industrialising our country, in order to enable a steady employment for our civilians."
LNS_further_industrialisation:0 "More Factories!"
LNS_further_industrialisation_desc:0 "The initial industrial expansion has been a success, and we shall follow up on it by opening more factories and workplaces."
LNS_teach_the_people:0 "New Education Standards"
LNS_teach_the_people_desc:0 "The commonfolk can only educate themselves up to a certain level. In order to bring our nation to a more contemporary state, we must expand our education centres, open new scientific institutes and invite foreign educators from the Heartlands."
LNS_military_education:0 "Mandatory Basic Training"
LNS_military_education_desc:0 "The world is a dangerous place, and we won't survive for long if we don't institute a mandatory training program for all able-bodied citizens. That way, once the next war inevitably starts, we'll have a large pool of griffons and ponies already fit for recruitment."
LNS_a_gun_in_every_home:0 "Weapons for Everyone"
LNS_a_gun_in_every_home_desc:0 "Freedom cannot be guaranteed without a means to defend it, and the best way to do that is by loosening firearm ownership regulations and providing extra subsidies to weapon manufacturers. An armed society is a safe society."
LNS_recruitment_drive:0 "Recruitment Campaign"
LNS_recruitment_drive_desc:0 "By extensive propaganda effort, we can show the civilians the glory and honour of serving in our military! Of course, to ensure that they stay in our forces, additional benefits and privileges will be given to soldiers and auxiliary forces."
LNS_lessons_of_the_partisans:0 "Incorporate Partisan Tactics"
LNS_lessons_of_the_partisans_desc:0 "Some of the surviving Partisans have expressed interest in serving in our forces. Better yet, they've offered to share their tactics and finesse! Our soldiers will be become even more skilled in every aspect of warfare."
LNS_state_armouries:0 "Firearm Production Expansion"
LNS_state_armouries_desc:0 "All these new recruits will require a lot more equipment than we can currently produce. To solve this, additional factories focused on firearm production will be built, and already existing ones will have their machines upgraded to increase production."
LNS_military_police_f:0 "Militärpolizei"
LNS_military_police_f_desc:0 "To ensure our troops are loyal to the cause, we shall establish a paramilitary force in charge of maintaining discipline, rooting out any traitors or saboteurs, and to spread our carefully woven propaganda. This will ensure our military is one step ahead compared to our foes."
LNS_old_friends:0 "Our Friends in the Empire"
LNS_old_friends_desc:0 "Now that we've restored the proper Longswordian nation, an envoy will be sent to Griffenheim to reestablish our relations with the Empire. They will be happy knowing they can sleep in peace, with the stalwart defenders of the eastern borders preventing any incursions."
LNS_pensions:0 "Military Pensions"
LNS_pensions_desc:0 "Most of our veterans have a difficult time adjusting returning to a civilian society, even with their land grants. Many have gone bankrupt or unable to properly feed themselves, and this cannot be allowed. A basic income for our retired troops will be instituted, to properly show our gratitude for their years of service."
LNS_dealing_with_hellquill_military:0 "The Problem of Hellquill"
LNS_dealing_with_hellquill_military_desc:0 "Our northern neighbours in Hellquill have been our staunch allies for an extensive time, but recent events have mired this long standing relationship. We must investigate the ongoings and political situation in their lands, and react appropriately."
LNS_bauxite_deposits:0 "Bauxite Mines"
LNS_bauxite_deposits_desc:0 "Large amounts of bauxite have been uncovered while digging for iron in the mines near Zeldstadt. To an average griffon, this sedimentary rock might seem worthless, but from it we can extract precious aluminium, a key component in production of modern airplanes."
LNS_a_proper_nation:0 "A Modern Society"
LNS_a_proper_nation_desc:0 "At last, we have brought Longsword to a modern age. No longer shall the commonfolk remain ignorant and unaware of the world beyond their homes, nor shall we be left behind in the research of newest technologies."
LNS_imperial_volunteers:0 "Imperial Aid"
LNS_imperial_volunteers_desc:0 "Our diplomatic efforts have paid off, and volunteers from the Heartlands have arrived to assist us in holding the border. This is a tremendous help to our efforts."
LNS_shield_of_griffonia:0 "Protectors of Griffonia"
LNS_shield_of_griffonia_desc:0 "With the lands of Hellquill now united with ours, together we shall stand united against any incursions from the eastern ponies. There can no telling when a radical leader takes over in the Riverlands and decides to wage war on honest living griffons... To this we say, let them come! We shall be prepared for anything, and we shall never falter in our duty!"

LNS_army_creation_neutral:0 "Rebuilding Our Army"
LNS_army_creation_neutral_desc:0 "Dusktalon and his thugs have neglected the proper Longswordian army for too long. No more! We shall rebuild our forces to a more contemporary time while remaining true to the ideals of our honourable ancestors."
LNS_pure_army:0 "Griffons Only!"
LNS_pure_army_desc:0 "The ponies cannot be entirely trusted to serve in our forces. While we have saved them from the clutches of the Reformisten, who's to say they won't turn on us, once their gratitude for us evaporates? No, only griffons will be allowed to serve in the armed forces. They're stronger, they can fly, and don't require specially crafted firearms."
LNS_mixed_army:0 "Allow Recruitment of Ponies"
LNS_mixed_army_desc:0 "We cannot be selective with our recruitment criterias, given our country's small size. Provided they don't cause any trouble, ponies will be allowed to serve side by side with griffons in the defence of Longsword."
LNS_superior_army_1:0 "Feuer und Schwefel"
LNS_superior_army_1_desc:0 "Only through overwhelming firepower can we secure victory. Massing our artillery, improving our firearms, coordination with the air forces - anything and everything to ensure a maximum output of devastation onto the enemy. They won't be able to withstand our barrage."
LNS_mass_army_1:0 "Eine Welle von Körpern"
LNS_mass_army_1_desc:0 "With our current situation, we cannot hope to field armies larger than our current threats. We shall compensate by doubling down on recruiment and mass assault tactics, in order to achieve an approximate parity in military strength."
LNS_mobile_army_1:0 "Gepanzerte Kriegsführung"
LNS_mobile_army_1_desc:0 "Our more traditionalist commanders scoff at the idea, but the reality is that a highly mobile army is the future of warfare. By overrunning our enemies before they can properly react, a swift and decisive victory will be ensured."
LNS_military_industrial_complex:0 "Military-Industrial Complex"
LNS_military_industrial_complex_desc:0 "In order to supply our forces with everything they might need, our defence industries and the military will be closely cooperating in opening new facilities and production lines."
LNS_rifle_modernisation:0 "New Guns"
LNS_rifle_modernisation_desc:0 "Our current firearm models are obsolete and prone to frequent breakdowns. This is unacceptable for a militarised society like ours, and to solve this, we shall procure newest models from the Heartlands and beyond."
LNS_proper_trucks:0 "Improved Motorised Models"
LNS_proper_trucks_desc:0 "While the current motorised models are suitable for transporting troops quickly, they cannot quite hold up in a proper fight. Turning them into a light tank variant will ensure our troops can be protected, while maintaining their mobility."
LNS_radio_utilisation:0 "Military Applications of the Radio"
LNS_radio_utilisation_desc:0 "The wonderful invention called radio has solved many issues we've been facing for ages, but now they must adapted for our usage in armed forces. With it, we can coordinate our assaults and issue requisition orders as soon as needed."
LNS_artillery_military:0 "The Cannons of the Future"
LNS_artillery_military_desc:0 "Our current artillery models are falling apart and cannot keep up with their objectives anymore. New designs will be required that make use of longer barrels, hydraulic recoil devices and lighter but more destructive shells."
LNS_engineer_f:0 "Dedicated Engineer Companies"
LNS_engineer_f_desc:0 "Digging ditches and building makeshift bridges isn't glamourous work, but it is crucial in assisting our forces. Dedicated support squads will be established."
LNS_recon_f:0 "Scouting Ahead"
LNS_recon_f_desc:0 "There's more to war than just fighting your enemy, for we must always know what lies ahead of us. A prepared army is a victorious army."
LNS_light_tanks_military:0 "Initial Armoured Attempt"
LNS_light_tanks_military_desc:0 "It might have seemed like a foolish idea, but placing as much armour on a truck it could hold and having it withstand small arms assault has shown that there is promise in these tanks. We shall expand on this development, and build proper models soon enough!"
LNS_medium_tanks_military:0 "A Proper Tank"
LNS_medium_tanks_military_desc:0 "Now that our initial efforts have beared results, we are free to design a proper battle tank instead of just repurposing a truck or a tractor. They will be the mainstay of our motorised forces."
LNS_magical_rifles:0 "Innovative Uses of Magic"
LNS_magical_rifles_desc:0 "Magic has been a mainstay of our ordinary lives since as long as we can remember, but only recently we've discovered a way to store spells inside magical crystals. With some ingenuity, we can store these crystals in a prototype rifle, and create a much better weapon than current conventional models."
LNS_spec_ops:0 "Dedicated Special Operation Teams"
LNS_spec_ops_desc:0 "In ages past, each knight was an army in itself, being highly independent. Nowadays we can't let individual specially trained troops wander on their own objectives, but instead we shall form entire divisions of these hardy griffons."
LNS_rather_heavy_tanks:0 "Bulldoze Our Enemies"
LNS_rather_heavy_tanks_desc:0 "With our success in designing tanks, we can now apply this knowledge in building the largest and most armoured tanks. No defensive line will be able to withstand their assault."
LNS_rocket_artillery:0 "More Explosions!"
LNS_rocket_artillery_desc:0 "While rocket based artillery is more innacurate compared to regular towed pieces, they make it up in inflicted devastation. We shall begin including them in our mainstay forces, once the initial designs pass the testing stages."
LNS_special_forces_initiative:0 "Glorify the Elites"
LNS_special_forces_initiative_desc:0 "Our elites are truly the pride of our military! Highly trained and professional, every aspiring regular soldier and civilian wants to be a part of our elite corps. Let us ensure that by expanding our training programs and raising our limits."
LNS_blitzkrieg:0 "Thunderous Warfare"
LNS_blitzkrieg_desc:0 "Our recent innovations in mobile warfare have been a great success, and now we can apply them to all of our forces. They will be able to keep up with our coordinated assault from both air and land."
LNS_zeldstadt_institute:0 "Zeldstadt Military Institute"
LNS_zeldstadt_institute_desc:0 "We've learned much about the modern art of warfare, but that doesn't mean every officer and commander in the army knows about them. A military academy to teach our commissioned troops will be established, so they can be at the forefront of tactical leadership."

LNS_navy_and_airforce_military:0 "The War at Sea and Air"
LNS_navy_and_airforce_military_desc:0 "The rapidly changing aspect of modern warfare requires us to think in more dimensions than just pure land forces. Control of the seas and skies are crucial, as well."
LNS_air_doctrine_military:0 "Choosing Our Airforce Strategy"
LNS_air_doctrine_military_desc:0 "Our growing airforce requires a dedicated doctrine to operate more efficiently. After consulting our production capabilities and available plane models, we shall make the decision for our best choice."
LNS_navy_doctrine_military:0 "Naval Doctrine"
LNS_navy_doctrine_military_desc:0 "Ships require a certain strategy to operate in their fullest, and to achieve that, we must look into existing naval doctrines and adapting the ones that suit our needs the most."
LNS_proper_airbases_military:0 "Hangars for the Planes"
LNS_proper_airbases_military_desc:0 "Enemies can strike with their planes from any direction, and relying on a single base for our planes is risky. Building additional ones will expand our coverage, and ensure our own planes can have multiple bases to refuel from, in case the others are disabled."
LNS_radar_project_military:0 "Improving Our Radar"
LNS_radar_project_military_desc:0 "With the increased reliance on radio communication, a system will be designed to intercept and locate these signals. Radar, as it is called, will ensure we won't be blind from sudden attacks from land, sea or sky."
LNS_home_port_military:0 "Our Home Port"
LNS_home_port_military_desc:0 "A central location from which we shall base our ships and ports must be chosen, in order to smoothen the establishing of our naval forces."
LNS_tac_bomber_focus_military:0 "Tactical Bomber Designs"
LNS_tac_bomber_focus_military_desc:0 "The increasing reliance on fortifications makes it hard for our troops to properly assault enemy positions. Artillery being less effective against these concrete bunkers, we shall instead focus on building bomber airplane models to hit them harder than before."
LNS_strat_bomber_focus_military:0 "Strategic Bomber Developments"
LNS_strat_bomber_focus_military_desc:0 "Many years of fighting has showed that a war can't be won by just killing our enemies, but by destroying their industry and military bases. Reducing their capabilities to produce firearms will ensure a collapse of their frontlines, and do that, we shall design our largest bomber model yet."
LNS_fighters_focus_military:0 "Controlling the Skies"
LNS_fighters_focus_military_desc:0 "Each plane in the sky assures our ground forces will have a smoother time. We must look into improving our fighter models, if we want to maintain our superiority."
LNS_close_support_focus_military:0 "Support for the Ground Forces"
LNS_close_support_focus_military_desc:0 "Bombers are expensive to build and maintain, which is why a dedicated fighter model will be made, carrying a similar payload to assist our ground forces in destroying our foes."
LNS_heavy_fighters_focus_military:0 "Heavy Fighter Initiative"
LNS_heavy_fighters_focus_military_desc:0 "While regular fighters are appropriate for contesting the skies, they do not have the range to keep up with our bombers. Larger, more heavily armed and armoured fighters will be made to give our bombers much needed protection."
LNS_plane_factory_military:0 "Kupiškis Institute of Aviation"
LNS_plane_factory_military_desc:0 "The war of air is the war of tomorrow. We cannot afford to ignore this new field of warfare nor can we afford aircraft at all! Having production centers specialised in aircraft fabrication will help lower the cost of these new death machines."
LNS_rocketry_focus_military:0 "Faster than Sound"
LNS_rocketry_focus_military_desc:0 "Our prototype rockets have shown great promise with their speed and ability to carry a destructive payload. Expanding on this, we can produce reliable models that can strike our enemies from vast ranges, with no danger to the lives of our soldiers."
LNS_naval_aviation_military:0 "Bombing their Ships"
LNS_naval_aviation_military_desc:0 "The current ship designs are quite vulnerable towards attacks based from the sky. Our current bomber models do not have the reach for this task, but a specially designed bomber could specialise in this task and secure our control of the seas."
### A big thanks to Captain for writing some of the following naval focuses, go pat him
LNS_destroyer_focus_military:0 "Building Our Destroyers"
LNS_destroyer_focus_military_desc:0 "Now that we have secured a suitable base of operations, the time has come to take the next step in our efforts to provide a naval shield for the Empire. In order to secure the shipping lanes and hunt potential threat from beneath the waves, we can now focus our efforts on creating more advanced destroyer designs."
LNS_submarine_focus_military:0 "A Subtle Deterrent"
LNS_submarine_focus_military_desc:0 "Submarines might be a dishonourable weapon, but they are excellent at destroying enemy convoys and lone ships, strangling their control of the seas. We must expand our submarine flotilla to ensure our foes cannot wander the seas uncontested."
LNS_cruiser_focus_military:0 "Screens for the Navy"
LNS_cruiser_focus_military_desc:0 "Our continuing efforts to secure the waves for the Empire require us to design larger and more powerful vessels, capable of fending off the assaults of destroyers and other small ships, while remaining fast and maneuverable. These cruiser designs will significantly increase our naval presence."
LNS_battlecruiser_focus_military:0 "A Proper Ship"
LNS_battlecruiser_focus_military_desc:0 "The growth of our naval forces has reached the point where we now feel ready to begin work on capital warships. Fast and well armed, battlecruisers will allow us to project true power far from land, and mark our transition from a purely defensive stance to having the ability to strike back at menacing foes."
LNS_battleship_focus_military:0 "Floating Fortresses"
LNS_battleship_focus_military_desc:0 "To truly express the grandeur and glory of the Empire on the waves, only one type of warship will suffice: we need battleships. Heavily armed and powerfully protected, these ship will bring us, and the Empire, glory, and strike fear into the hearts of any that dare to challenge our naval mastery."
LNS_expanded_docks_military:0 "Continue Dockyard Expansion"
LNS_expanded_docks_military_desc:0 "Our growing navy requires more production facilities than we currently have. If we want to drastically cut down the construction times for our ships, we must look into expanding our dockyards and ports."
LNS_carriers_focus_military:0 "Union of Sea and Sky"
LNS_carriers_focus_military_desc:0 "Victory on the seas is not determined anymore by who has the most ships, but who can control the skies as well. With convoys adapted to carry fighters and bombers, we shall be able to solidify our grasp on the seas once and for all."
LNS_nuclear_focus:0 "The Ultimate Solution"
LNS_nuclear_focus_desc:0 "The atoms hold many secrets to the creation of our world, but more importantly, we can use the knowledge of their interactions to construct facilities to produce staggering amounts of energy and weapons that will instill fear in our foes..."

### Events ###
longsword.1.t:0 "The National Liberation Committee"
longsword.1.d:0 ""Be welcome, comrades", Starry Night spoke to her fellow revolutionaries in a secluded forest grove. "I'm glad you could all safely make it. I've gathered us today to discuss our plan of action against the increasing Black Cloak threat. Not a day passes that we don't hear about villages being burned, families slaughtered or corpses floating in the river! This has gone on long enough, what will we do about it?" \n\n"We will resist, we will fight, we will bite!", the small crowd intoned. \n\n"Glory, comrades!", Starry continued, "As I speak, our friends in Hellquill and Lake City are moving in to bring us aid! Dusktalon and his cronies will not harm innocent ponies anymore! A new dawn rises, and we will be free!". The partisans cheered and stomped their hooves in response. A glint of hope was seen in each of their eyes, for the first time in a while. They will be prepared for what is to come."
longsword.1.a:0 "Mes niekada nenustosime priešintis!"

longsword.2.t:0 "The Journey Begins"
longsword.2.d:0 ""Is everypony here?" You asked the group of partisans which had gathered near the edge of the forest. Nine voices responded in confirmation. This meant that all of them were here here. "Good. Before we leave though, I want to say two things. Firstly, I want to thank all of you for deciding to accompany me in this highly difficult and dangerous mission. Secondly, I would like to remind everypony that while we shouldn’t encounter any of the count’s soldiers in our path, we should still remain alert as griffons posses far better vision in the dark than any of us. So try not to cause any noise while advancing, we wouldn’t want to attract unwanted attention, would we? Now that all of this is out of the way.""
longsword.2.a:0 "Onto Kupiškis!"

longsword.3.t:0 "The Outskirts of Kupiškis"
longsword.3.d:0 "As the last rays of sunlight fell onto earth you emerged from the forest. Even for experienced partisans, the advance towards Kupiškis wasn’t the easiest one. In order to avoid any possible contact with the griffon soldiers loyal to the count you had to spend entire days hidden within the most uncomfortable places possible and even cross several highly dangerous swamps, which nearly resulted in several deaths. However this didn’t matter anymore, now you had approached Kupiškis, the halfway mark of the mission. From here on the path towards Hellquil should be easier, but that would come tomorrow. Now you and your group needs to rest from days and nights of marching and hiding. However this raises a question.Camping outside isn’t ideal and Kupiškis has a substantial pony population living within it’s walls, maybe some of them would take you in?"
longsword.3.a:0 "I'm certain our fellow Ponies shall help us!"

longsword.4.d:0 "You left the flat in which your group spent the night in early morning. As the first rays of the morning sun fell on the still sleeping city you said goodbye to the ponies which took you in the last night and began slowly and carefully moving through the streets of Kupiškis. It was far easier to evade the griffon guards than it was the night before, most of them must have been tired from patrolling the streets of the city for the entire night. You and the other partisans, on the other hand, had a full night rest and thus were able to slip out of the city with relative ease. \n\nKupiškis was the last settlement with any substantial military forces loyal to the count on their path. Covering the remaining distance to your goal should be simple."

longsword.5.d:0 "As the morning sun cast it’s rays onto the awakening earth you and the other partisans packed up your equipment and items and began moving again. You advanced through the wilderness until it was safe to assume that even the most keen-eyed griffons couldn’t see your movement. From here on, your journey should be far safer as Kupiškis was the last urban center with any substantial presence of griffon military forces in your path. Covering the remaining distance to our goal should be simple."

longsword.6.t:0 "The Guards"
longsword.6.d:0 "Sneaking into Kupiškis wasn’t a very difficult task which you accomplished with ease. Your current goal was to reach the old town, the part of the city which was inhabited by ponies, and where you knew you could find help. However as you moved through the streets of the sleeping city, you encountered a problem - the griffon guard patrols. While they weren’t extremely numerous, they were usually patrolling main streets. This meant that now you have to spend substantial amounts of time just trying to go around them all. But at least you were making progress.\n\nAs you looked at the walls which separated the old town from the rest of the city, you silently cursed to yourself. There were at least a dozen griffons standing guard near the main gate, which strangely enough was open, and the square in front of it. Three of the patrols were talking to another griffon who, from what you could hear and understand, was trying to convince the guard to allow him to go through the gate. Of course the guard didn’t want to let the other griffon through, constantly repeating that as enforcers of the law, they aren’t allowed to go back on their orders and allow anyone through. You know, however, that this is probably a huge lie. Most griffon officials were corrupt to the core. Though it might be risky, you could try bribing your way through the gate. Though the patrols do seem to be focused on the trespassing griffon."

longsword.7.d:0 "As you lie down on an actual bed for the first time in several years and feel all the stress leaving your body, you decide that despite all the risks that your group had taken while sneaking into Kupiškis, it was all worth it. However as you looked at your comrades, you notice that they aren’t really sharing the mood. They are clearly nervous and seem to expect that griffon guards are going to break into the flat at any moment. Most of them are still clinging on their weapons and glancing at the windows and the door into the room every few seconds.\n\n You sigh to yourself. If none of them will be able to get any rest, what was even the point of getting here if none of you will be able to get any rest?"
longsword.7.a:0 "Take a break folks, we've a long day ahead of us tomorrow."

longsword.8.t:0 "The Fight"
longsword.8.d:0 "One of the griffons raised his rifle and aimed it at you. "You are under arrest for being outside on curfew hours and trying to bribe a guard." One of them spoke. \n\nWell, this was an outcome that you couldn’t have expected. What were even the chances that you would encounter an uncorrupt griffon guard in Kupiškis at this point in time? Quite slim, you imagined. But maybe the guard was corrupt and was just trying to get more out of you?\n\n"How about two hundred gold crowns?"\n\n"You dare to mock me?!" The griffon gnarled at you, before trying to strike you with his rifle.\n\nThe griffon collapsed on the ground, blood spilling from a hole in the place where one of his eyes used to be. You turned your head slightly to see one of the partisans belonging to your group aiming his weapon at another of the guards. Looks like trying to get through without killing everyone wouldn’t be an option anymore."
longsword.8.a:0 "Well fuck... everypony attack!"

longsword.9.t:0 "A Hasty Exit"
longsword.9.d:0 "There were more griffon patrols than the partisans, but you had the element of surprise on your side and somehow managed to overwhelm the guards and kill them all. Of course your group didn’t emerge out of the firefight completely without harm, with a few suffering minor wounds from bullets scrapping their bodies while one of the partisans was shot in their right front leg. You patched her wound up to the best of your abilities in such a short amount of time. While others suggested to do so when the group reaches safety, you decided that you wouldn’t risk the guards finding you due to the mare’s blood. Only after you were sure that there wasn’t a way that the griffons could track, you ordered your group to run. \n\nWhile you couldn’t spend much time in Kupiškis it was enough to get some proper sleep, some good food and to bandage the wounds that the other partisans suffered properly. Now they wouldn’t fall off and the yesterday situation wouldn’t repeat again, hopefully.\n\nAs the group was about to leave, you turned to the owners of the apartment. \n\n"Thank you for taking us in." You looked around the room one last time before leaving."

longsword.10.t:0 "An Unfortunate Series of Events"
longsword.10.d:0 "The element of surprise was on the side of the partisan while the griffon guard was spread out in the open. But they had the greater numbers, and it seems that this was enough. Your comrades were dying all around you, pierced by the griffon bullets. You weren’t in the best position yourself either, blood was oozing from several bullet scrapes all across your body. Trying to retreat wasn’t an option, at least not anymore, griffons surrounded the alley where the last living members of the partisans were standing their ground. \n\nA sharp pain pierced your chest as you fell backwards from an impact, collapsing onto the pavement.You tried to get up, only to slip on something and fall again. Breathing was becoming harder and your muscles seemed to be weaker than before. You tried standing up yet again, and this time you somehow manage, only to notice a massive puddle of red liquid under you."
longsword.10.a:0 "Is... is... that... my blood?"

longsword.11.t:0 "Dead in a Flash"
longsword.11.d:0 ""Stop right there" You heard one of the griffon guards scream as you left the shadowy alley from which you were observing the situation at the gate. You turned towards the patrols who were now aiming their rifles at you. \n\n"Gentelgriffs, how could I help you?" You ask, trying to force out a smile.\n\n"What are you doing outside on curfew hours?" One of the Griffons questioned. \n\n"Well I was just returning to…" You couldn’t finish your sentence before one of the guards began screaming. \n\n"The pony is armed!" Screamed out one of the guards. \n\nThe last thing you saw before the griffon bullets pierced your skull were your comrades jumping out of the shadows and opening fire in an attempt to save you."
longsword.11.a:0 "For fuck sake."

longsword.12.t:0 "The Guards in the Forest"
longsword.12.d:0 "You thought that camping in the forest and not entering Kupiškis would mean that there wouldn’t be any griffon patrols and guards that you would need to avoid to remain safe. However, as the griffon guard patrol stopped right next to the grove where you planned to set up your camp, you decided that you should move further from the city and deeper into the forest in order to avoid any chance of encountering griffons again. Of course this would mean that you would have to spend some time getting back on the path tomorrow, but not getting shot while you are asleep is worth those few minutes. Though of course, to move deeper in the forest, you have to get past the patrol."

longsword.13.t:0 "A Sad End"
longsword.13.d:0 "You laid on the ground, unable to move your legs properly anymore, blood and tears streaming down your cheeks. You had doomed not only yourself, but also the other partisans and your mission. In your idiocy you decided to engage the griffon guard in close combat. You overestimated your capabilities and the mutilation of your body was the price you had to pay. Your remaining eye was barely able to focus on anything anymore, but you could still see the few remaining ponies trying to retreat from the onslaught of the griffon guard. For a moment you still held hope that maybe some of them could finish the mission, but as one of them fired his weapon, you realized that they didn’t have a chance anymore, other patrolling guards would be here very soon.

Though it doesn’t seem that the guards are noticing your movement, so maybe if you move a bit faster….\n\nYour blood freezes as you hear the hoof of one of the partisans breaking a branch. \n\n”There are partisans in the bushes!” Screamed out one of the griffons and aimed his rifle in your direction."
longsword.14.a:0 "To Battle!"

longsword.15.t:0 "Victory!"
longsword.15.d:0 "If the griffons have had similar numbers to your group, attempting to engage them in close combat would have been suicidal. But you had the numbers and the patrol didn’t expect such a bold assault. Their moment of confusion allowed your group to close the distance and engage in close combat.Usually you would simply open fire, but there was a chance that other griffon guard patrols were nearby, and thus you couldn’t allow a single bullet to be shot in this fight. And somehow your group managed to achieve it. The fight that followed was quite grotesque as the only way the ponies had of executing griffons was stomping on them until they finished moving, but this didn’t matter, you had won, and without any casualties at that and secured your way deeper into the forest."

As you begin to move slower and think more about where you place your next step, it seems that your comrades began mimicking you, as the amount of noise they were causing lessened. \n\n"Why are we slowing down?" The mare who was directly behind you whispered."Shouldn’t we try to move through as swiftly as possible?""

Come now, the others are waiting.”\n\nThe owner of the apartment led you to what was presumable to be the biggest room inside his property, which was absolutely filled with ponies. \n\n”Can I have all of your attention please?" The owner addressed the gathering within the chamber. While it took some time, the chitchat and discussions ended, allowing the unicorn to continue his speech."Today we have a group of very important guests here, a group of partisans from Longsword."\n\nThe owner of the flat invited you to take his place as he moved to the side and stood next to the other local ponies. While you were hesitant, you weren’t that good at speeches, you took the place where he stood and addressed those who had gathered here.\n\n”As most of you probably know, the current count of our country is the mad leader of the Longswordian Reformisten - Dusktalon. For years this insane griffon has been trying to exterminate us and our culture, to wipe it off the face of the earth. We resisted this lunatic and his cronies for these long and blood filled years, and finally we are seemingly approaching victory. But we can’t do this alone. And this is why the leader of our movement has sent us here, to request help from you, our brothers and sisters within Hellquil. So I ask you, will you help us?”\n\nEvery single creature within the room raised one of their frontal legs into the air. Confused by this you turned your head towards the owner, who smiled and stated.\n\n"The ponies of Hellquil will help you in the upcoming struggle.""

Below and above such illustrations were revolutionary slogans and sometimes lists of "crimes" commited by the Count and the Black Cloaks. The posters demanded the populace to join a "just" cause and help in overthrowing the "tyrant of Longsword" so that both griffons and ponies could be "freed from their shackles"."

To show what happens to those who support the tyrant Count and his cronies!" The partisans of both races cheered in response. "We fought against the Black Cloaks and the crusaders in the forests of our homelands for decades, far away from the major cities. This gave the enemy the impression that we are weak, that there would be no repercussion if they chose to support the destruction of the ponykind. The time has come for us to destroy such delusional fantasies!" The cheering of the partisans increased in volume and intensity with every sentence their leader spoke. "We will hunt them down in their cities and strongholds and show everyone what happens to those who choose to align themselves with the tyrants and oppressors!" The cheering turned into something that could be described as roaring. "Who will be our targets, comrade?", one of the revolutionaries asked as the ponies and griffons calmed down."

Hundreds of griffon bodies were covering the streets and squares of the Longswordian cities. Black Cloaks, knights, military commanders and administrators known for their close connections with the Count and antagonism towards ponies laid in the streets or hung from the trees, all of them sharing the same cause of death, a single deep cut in their necks. On the chest of every slain griffon was one of the symbols related to the partisans and a single word in the language of native ponies - "Revenge". The message from the revolutionaries towards the griffons of Longsword was clear. They had hunted and killed ponies for centuries, and now they would suffer the same fate."

But they weren't the only ones who suffered such gruesome fate. Everyone who had even a remote connection with these groups were treated the same. Family members, friends, even those who worked and owned businesses that the Black Cloaks and knights were known to visit, all were slain in the same manner as the most fanatical supporters of the Count's genocidal policies. There was seemingly no single way of execution, as each victim was brutalized differently and to various extents. Some were simply shot or stabbed, while others were ripped apart. Though there were some things identical about these butchered carcasses. In every place where there was at least one body was located, there would always be a symbol drawn on the closest building, and the symbols would always be connected to one of the partisan groups. The message from the revolutionaries towards the griffons of Longsword was clear. They butchered the ponies for centuries, and now they would suffer the same fate."

"It seems that our terror didn’t result in Count and the Black Cloaks losing support from the population. Rather, we seem have turned them against ourselves." \n\n"A substantial percentage of the population of the country, even other ponies, don’t see us as liberators or freedom fighters anymore. They see us as bloodthirsty butchers.", Arklid, the second in command of "Varėnė" district continued where Vycolt stopped. "The population now either thinks that the Count's policies are justified, or that we are just a reflection of the Count and his Black Cloaks, just a genocidal group of lunatics with too much influence and support. In fact, already, some of our biggest supporters have cut ties with us due to our actions that night and diverted their help towards other groups which oppose Dusktalon and his cronies. If such a trend continues, I fear that our enemies might gather substantial support from the pony population which opposes us due to our actions.""

But what was being discussed today was important enough to risk it all. After all, today they were beginning the preparations for the uprising. \n\n"Comrades.", Abba Povner, one of the most important figures in the movement, addressed the revolutionaries who had gathered in the bunker. "For generations we fought the Count and his Black Cloaks in the forests and swamps of our homeland and achieved some truly great victories. However, we cannot defeat the tyrant Dusktalon and his cronies like this. To achieve our independence we will have to engage our enemies in the open. And our forces simply aren’t ready for such a military campaign. After long discussions and arguments between the most capable leaders of our movement it has been decided that with resources that are available to us now or will be available in near future there are two possible ways to prepare our forces for the uprising. We can either attempt to increase our numbers or improve the martial prowess and marksmanship of our fighters." Abba turned towards the leader of the revolutionaries.

However, with the numbers of weapons we have been ordered to provide this time, I don’t think I have the necessary experience to choose the target myself." \n\n"Two possible locations have been chosen, am I correct?" Starry Night asked the unicorn, satisfied with the explanation. \n\n"Indeed. There are only two possible ways how we can acquire all the equipment that the movement needs in one swift move. We can attempt to use the substantial amount of supporters and fighters of our movement in Haarsingen to steal the necessary equipment from the main weapons storage of the city. The other option is to try attacking the vehicles that are transporting weaponry to Zeltstad. Either of these would require massive concentrations of resources, and thus I believe that you should be the one choosing which action we should take.

Starry Night responded, looking at the plans and depictions of a building complex which were displayed on the wooden table in the middle of the bunker. "It is located within the city itself?" \n\n"Indeed, the manor and it’s surroundings, while not originally built within the borders of the city, are currently located in one of the districts within Visaginas. This unique history means that the complex is surrounded by a substantial amount of parks and gardens and even fortified walls, which means that nobody who isn’t part of the movement should notice any changes." \n\n"Then I do believe that this will be more than enough. Please tell Gottard that the revolutionary army is grateful for his help in the great struggle against tyranny." \n\n"I believe Lord Tyzenhauzen will be glad to hear this. May Arcturius help you in your struggle." \n\nAs the griffon was leaving, Starry Night looked through the documents laying on the table and smiled. This was simply perfect. Now they not only had a proper base of operations within Visaginas, the administrative and military centre of Southern Longsword, but also an estate big enough to house one of the ideas that the revolutionary leader wished to put into action for some time - establishing a preliminary government. This was the culmination of the reorganization of the movement. They were no longer groups of guerrillas hiding in the forests, they were an army.

There seems to be a massive increase of military personnel in the region of Panacea and especially within Swordson. This by itself wouldn’t be such a surprise with the increased activities of your movement, but on one of the mornings in the city I heard quite the unexpected radio broadcast. It was by Field Marshal Conrad Silvertalon.

Such arrogance and malevolence would not be allowed to continue! Abba aimed his rifle at another griffon and pulled the trigger. He had promised that for every injustice that ponies suffered, the count's loyalists would suffer tenfold, and he was going to keep it. \n\nAbba gazed across his surroundings. The Black Cloaks, now greatly reduced, fled the city and it's surroundings. Thousands of ponies were freed from their shackles. Truly, this was a...

They eliminated most of the capable Reformisten leadership. They destroyed the Count’s supporters in the battle of Varėna. And now, it was time.\n\nAcross Southern Ilgakardija the partisans left their hiding places in the vast forests and remote villages and began their onslaught. They marched upon the settlements that were still in control of Black Cloaks or their allies, slaying the Count’s loyalists wherever they were found. Soldiers, previously thought as loyal would turn against their former compatriots, gunning them down while chanting the slogans of the resistance. Within the fortresses which were erected in the days of Grover I, Partisan aligned knights engaged the ones who devoted themselves to the Count’s cause with blades and guns and slew them. \n\nIn Visaginas, the administrative and military capital of the region fell in but a few hours as a massive contingent of Partisan fighters, under the leadership of Starry Night cleansed the city of any remaining Reformisten or their supporters, leaving the city withing the hands of the revolutionaries. With this, the preliminary government swiftly took over the leadership positions that were left empty with the execution of members of the previous governing body of the region. \n\nIn a single day, an entire third of the country fell under the control of the Partisans and their countless allies.

Unfortunately, while most of his high ranking subordinates have gotten away, we have managed to shoot the despotic Count! His body was dragged back to Swordsson, where it was strung up a noose in the now abandoned execution square. The vengeful Partisans cheered at the display of irony, pelting the body with rocks, manure, spoiled produce, as a form of sick and twisted target practice. \n\nAcross the country, the last of the military rebellion have laid down their arms now that we've taken the fortified city of Zeldstadt. No retribution was taken against these honourable griffons, and they were allowed to peacefully leave the country, although we've tried to convince them to stay and help in reconstructing Longsword.\n\nThe victorious Partisans now face a difficult task of rebuilding Longsword in their ideal, calming the tensions between griffons and ponies, and preparing for any foreign incursions. Yet with their brilliant and fearless leader, Starry Night, the ponies feel confident in a bright future, free of hatred and tyranny."
longsword.31.a:0 "Victory!"

longsword.32.t:0 "A New Capital"
longsword.32.d:0 ""Comrades, we have gathered today to decide upon a very important matter. We need to decide upon the capital for independent Ilgakardija." \n\n"Comrade Starry, I have two propositions about the matter that I believe that most of us here would agree upon." \n\n"Yes comrade Abba, please speak." \n\n"Thank you. Comrades! I believe that due to the achievements of our leader we should rename our new capital after it is chosen after them. Those who agree with me raise one of your front legs." Majority of the ponies and griffons in the room raised they hooves and claws, respectively. "Good. And thus, as our new capital will be named after our leader, they should be the ones who name the city which will become our new capital. They should be the one who name which city will become Starrygrad. Do you agree with me comrades?" The claws and hooves rose into air again.\n\nAbba turned towards Starry Night.\n\n"Comrade Starry, it has been decided, name the city which will become our new capital.""
longsword.32.a:0 "Swordsson shall make a splendid spot for Starrygrad!"
longsword.32.b:0 "Zeldstadt is the perfect site for our new capital!"
longsword.32.c:0 "Visaginas, the centre of the Revolution!"

longsword.33.t:0 "Teaching the People"
longsword.33.d:0 "For the longest time, the system of education in Ilgakardija was abysmal. There were close to no schools, or any institutions of education really. And the what few schools existed were in a horrible shape and lacked funding. Our ministry of education had to start from scratch. And with dedication from ponies and griffons working in the institution, we are seemingly moving forwards. The old schools are being renovated and new ones are being built monthly. The old curriculum has been discarded completely, replaced by a new one which consists of courses which are deemed necessary to create an educated and capable society, which includes basic literacy, history and basic military training, among other various subjects.\n\nOf course, it will take a substantial amount of time before this reform is completed, but it already seems that we are slowly reaching positive results."
longsword.33.a:0 "A literate society is a free society!"

longsword.34.t:0 "Teaching the People"
longsword.34.d:0 "Compared to how it was just a short time ago, the educational situation within Ilgakardija is completely different. Previously, it was a country plagued by illiteracy, it’s leaders obsessed with delusions of grandeur rather than actually caring for the citizens. However, with the efforts of our ministry of education this has changed. New schools have been built, new, professional teachers have been trained, improved curriculum has been implemented and tens of thousand of books have been printed. And this has great results as literacy rates are rising in extreme rates. Of course, it will still take us years if not decades to reach complete literacy. However the percentage of literate ponies and griffons is now great enough that we aren’t suffering from the previously crippling effects of illiteracy."
longsword.34.a:0 "A literate society is a free society!"

longsword.35.t:0 "The Issue of Hellquill"
longsword.35.d:0 "While it has been agreed by many of the members of our government that the Knightly Order of Hellquil and our own state should become one, there have been arguments over how such an union should be achieved. Some suggest that we should try to achieve the union of our countries diplomatically. They argue that a country built on war and destruction would be extremely unstable and prone to internal conflicts. They are opposed by the more militant groups within our government who claim that not only would simply invading and conquering Hellquil would be a far quicker solution, not only that, it would justify us being the leaders of the newly formed state. "
longsword.35.a:0 "Diplomacy is the answer. Send an envoy."
longsword.35.b:0 "Only war shall solve this issue!"

longsword.36.t:0 "An Offer From Longsword"
longsword.36.d:0 "After the County of Longsword collapsed into the civil war and the rebels emerged victorious we were preparing for a full on invasion from the south. However, we didn’t expect that the new state of LOngsword would send diplomats rather than soldiers. Instead of invading us they requested that we join their state peacefully. They assure us that if we join them, we will be given a substantial amount of autonomy and will not be charged for any real or proclaimed crimes. However the diplomats never stated what will happen if we decide against this proposal."
longsword.36.a:0 "We shall accept."
longsword.36.b:0 "We respectfully decline."

longsword.37.t:0 "The Hellquillians Accept"
longsword.37.d:0 "Our diplomats returned with truly great news. The leadership of Hellquill, after quite a few debates and some time of consideration, have decided to accept our offer and join our nation peacefully. Of course it will take a long time to properly integrate these new territories into our nation properly. However this is still a great day worth celebrating."
longsword.37.a:0 "Welcome!"

longsword.38.t:0 "The Hellquillians Decline"
longsword.38.d:0 "Our diplomats have returned with extremely disappointing news. The leaders of Hellquill, despite our arguments and promises of peace and autonomy, have decided against our proposal of peaceful unification. This ignited a new argument between the members of our government. Some of them still believe in diplomatic resolution and thus think that we should accept this diplomatic defeat. Most, however, think that Hellquil must become part of our state, now."
longsword.38.a:0 "We must respect their decision."
longsword.38.b:0 "To Tartarus with it! War it is!"

longsword.39.t:0 "The Status of the Unions"
longsword.39.d:0 "As our country is slowly becoming a heavily industrial one the question of what should be done with the substantial amounts of workers unions within our expanding urban centers has been raised. A certain group within the government believes that these unions should be directly owned by the state in order for us to be able to exert a greater control over the industry in times of crisis. Their opposition, however, believes that we shouldn’t try to control such organizations as it might be considered contradictory with our proclaimed goals of liberty and freedom for both ponies and griffons."
longsword.39.a:0 "The State must control the Unions!"
longsword.39.b:0 "Let them be free."

longsword.40.t:0 "Dealing With the Impoverished"
longsword.40.d:0 "While under the control of the tyrant count Dusktalon, our country was in an extremely horrible position, with most of the population being stricken with poverty. However, with investments and programs from the new leadership, this situation is changing. With the countless new government created homeless shelters and other similar institutions to help those who are unable to provide for themselves and employ those who lack any source of income, it seems that we are slowly moving towards a better era."
longsword.40.a:0 "Soup kitchen is that way, Comrade."

longsword.41.t:0 "The Wealth of a Nation"
longsword.41.d:0 ""I still can’t believe we came this far." Arklidas told Ludwig with a smile.\n\n"You doubted the capabilities of our movement?"\n\n"To be honest, I did. Sometimes I find myself thinking that this must be just a dream. I simply can’t believe that this is reality."\n\n"Really? Are all our accomplishments that impossibly fantastical for you?"\n\n"Do you? Just look upon this city. Barely a few years ago it’s streets were filled with homeless and criminals. Ponies and griffons starved to death in the alleys. The signs of poverty could be seen everywhere… But now? The streets are clean and pristine, filled with happy members of both races. Underemployed is at all time low. Poverty is almost gone. It just seems unbelievable… I got so used to the sights of cities within Ilgakardija before our victory that I can only remember them as filled with suffering. But now…""
longsword.41.a:0 "Now everyone is happy!"

longsword.42.t:0 "One Last Argument"
longsword.42.d:0 "Conrad Silvertalon sat silently in the count's office. \n\n"And this is why, Silvertalon, we shall not rest until every last pony is removed from Longsword. They are the corruption destroying us from within.", Count Dusktalon droned on and on, "I need you to make our dream a reality.". Silvertalon, realising his efforts were in vain, stood up, gave a quick salute and left the room. The Count is worse than a brick wall! Nothing he said got to him! \n\nAs he was leaving the Count's residence, flanked by the Reformisten guards, he heard a pony screaming. Silvertalon closed his eyes and sighed. He had no real love for the ponies, but it was obvious slaughtering them senselessly would cause an even bigger disaster later on! \n\nIt is time to meet with the generals, and begin the plot to restore the honour of Longsword."
longsword.42.a:0 "Enough is enough!"

longsword.43.t:0 "Reconsidering Our Orders"
longsword.43.d:0 "Silvertalon looked at the envelope containing the latest orders, marked with the Count's personal seal. He quickly examined them and grimaced. The Count wanted to move a majority of the army to the Visaginas countryside, to assist in the massacre. \n\nThis will simply not stand. Having thrown the letter to the fireplace, he set forth on writing his own, more beneficial orders."
longsword.43.a:0 "Hopefully the Reformisten won't notice..."

longsword.44.t:0 "Increased Partisan Activity"
longsword.44.d:0 "Unfortunately, our recent redeployment orders for our troops have caught on with the Partisans, and they've began a series of raids now that the units previously guarding vulnerable areas have been repositioned. Count Dusktalon will be undoubtedly furious, but our more pressing concern is how this affects our future plans..."
longsword.44.a:0 "The Partisans won't be a problem..."

longsword.45.t:0 "The Reformisten in the Army"
longsword.45.d:0 "Many of the high positions in the Longswordian army have been occupied by Dusktalon's Reformisten goons, and their effect is starting to show. They're nothing but cruel martinets, disregarding their responsibilities, murdering innocent civilians and stealing their subordinates' paychecks. \n\nSilvertalon has met with his fellow conspirators in order to deal with them before they endanger the plot - have the loyalists murder them and pin the blame on the Partisans, or reassign them to Varėna, where the ponies will surely take a shot at their hated oppressors..."
longsword.45.a:0 "We'll dispose of them ourselves..."
longsword.45.b:0 "A vacation in Varėna could do them some good..."

longsword.46.t:0 "The Expected Result"
longsword.46.d:0 "This morning, battle reports have slowly trickled in from the countryside. \n\nThe rebellious ponies have struck a heavy blow to the Reformisten force sent to retake Varėna. The complete incompetence of the officers has led to a massive rout, with many wounded griffons returning to Swordsson. Count Dusktalon was furious and will undoubtedly sack the griffons responsible for this failure. \n\nSilvertalon has evaded the blame for sending the soldiers to Varėna, which led him and his conspirators to toast to their victory. The Reformisten's defeat had furthered their plans."
longsword.46.a:0 "The Partisans have their uses."

longsword.47.t:0 "A Hard Fought Victory"
longsword.47.d:0 "We've received reports from the military mission in Varėna. \n\nAfter days of vicious claw-to-hoof urban combat, the Reformisten forces have retaken Varėna from the ponies. Although both sides have taken heavy casualties, and isolated city sections are still occupied by the Partisans, this is a clear victory for the Reformisten. Count Dusktalon has issued minor rewards to the surviving officers for their courage and bravery. \n\nSilvertalon has begrudgingly expressed praise for the victorious griffons and their valour at arms."
longsword.47.a:0 "A loss for both sides."

longsword.48.t:0 "An Outstanding Victory!"
longsword.48.d:0 "It is everywhere! Every newspaper and radio broadcast are talking about it! \n\nOur attempt to send the Reformisten to a suicide mission in Varėna has spectacularly backfired, as they have retaken the city in a surprise night attack from the unprepared ponies. They were forced to give up quickly and disperse in the forests, and now the Reformisten flag flies proudly from the town hall's spire. Count Dusktalon has promoted the leading commander of the mission, and called him and his griffons "the heroes of Longsword". \n\nSilvertalon has expressed dismay to his fellow conspirators at this turn of events. We did not expect this astounding victory at all."
longsword.48.a:0 "The Reformisten are more dangerous than they seem..."

longsword.49.t:0 "Our Duty"
longsword.49.d:0 "An extensive fortification effort has begun in the cities of Zeldstadt and Kupiškis. The official reasoning by the military was "to protect our homes from the Partisan danger", but the civilians are somewhat doubtful of the truthfulness in this claim. Nonetheless, they welcomed the added degree of protection. \n\nOf course, the loyalists were fully aware of the purpose of these defences... If we can't take Longsword from Dusktalon, we'll outlast him."
longsword.49.a:0 "Our cause is noble and just! We will be ready!"

longsword.50.t:0 "Our Friends Abroad"
longsword.50.d:0 "Through Silvertalon's contacts in the Imperial Heartlands, we've convinced an arms shipment headed for Swordsson to make a stop at Zeldstadt. It contains latest firearm models and towed artillery pieces! Unfortunately, if we were to take everything, this would undoubtedly alarm the Reformisten to a conspiracy. \n\nAfter negotiations, it was decided the loss of the half of the shipment would be attributed to a Partisan raid - but which half shall we take for ourselves?"
longsword.50.a:0 "More rifles for the soldiers!"
longsword.50.b:0 "Artillery is the queen of the battlefield."

longsword.51.t:0 "Stocking Up"
longsword.51.d:0 "Even at best of times, the military hardly gets enough equipment to sustain itself, because of the Reformisten tightly controlling the production centres. The normally incompetent Count has delegated the factory supervision to his frightening and capable second-in-command, Rosa Heidenreich. She is... Something else entirely, and won't be so easily fooled. Silvertalon has decided to pay Heidenreich a personal visit in order to secure these firearms..."
longsword.51.a:0 "I'm sure Heidenreich can be convinced..."

longsword.52.t:0 "The Zeldstadt Lockdown"
longsword.52.d:0 "It was a regular morning in Swordsson, until it got interrupted by an unannounced radio broadcast. \n\n"This is Field Marshal Conrad Silvertalon of the Longsword High Command. We hereby denounce the excessive cruelty and barbarism of Count Dusktalon and his Reformisten allies. The Count is an illegitimate ruler who has no love for the people, or cares about Longsword! We invite every willing griffon and pony to join us in Zeldstadt, so we can restore the true values to Longsword!." \n\nWord spread like flame through the cities and villages, and soon enough many made their way to Zeldstadt. The people are tired of the Count's oppression!"
longsword.52.a:0 "Come and take it!"

longsword.53.t:0 "The Partisans Muster"
longsword.53.d:0 "Emboldened by our declaration of open defiance against the Reformisten, the Partisans have yet again increased their efforts in resisting and biting. They now control the area of Visaginas in all but name, and soon they'll march on Swordsson itself, seeking to establish their version of order. This is an obstruction to our plan of restoring the proper Longswordian nation, but Silvertalon is optimistic we can handle fighting a war on two fronts if we adequately prepare..."
longsword.53.a:0 "We shall be prepared for them."

longsword.54.t:0 "The Final Demonstration"
longsword.54.d:0 "This morning, the population of Longsword have awoken to a gruesome sight - griffon bodies lying in the streets, hanging from tree branches, shot in their homes and workplaces! However, it was quickly realised all of these griffons were connected to the hateful Reformisten, whether they were full members or voluntary collaborateurs. The commonfolk did not intervene as they watched this vigilante justice sporadically continue for the rest of the day. \n\nSurprisingly, the Count hasn't issued a reprisal or action against this open rebellion. Perhaps he was fearful of justice, as well."
longsword.54.a:0 "Their days are numbered."

longsword.55.t:0 "Spring Cleaning"
longsword.55.d:0 "The issue at claw cannot be ignored anymore, which led to Silvertalon gathering his staff to discuss the plan for disrupting the increasing Partisan activity. While everygriff agrees to divert some of our resources and soldiers into harassing the Partisans, there is no clear consensus on what method shall we use. Should we order our soldiers to raid areas known for Partisan recruitment, or send saboteurs to their armouries containing their precious stockpiles?"
longsword.55.a:0 "Target their recruitment centres!"
longsword.55.b:0 "Target their armouries!"

longsword.56.t:0 "The Long March"
longsword.56.d:0 "The preparations were completed, and now the loyalist columns of griffons and ponies proudly stood at attention outside of Zeldstadt. They've girded themselves in the traditional colours of Longswordian knightly orders to distinguish themselves apart from the despised Reformisten. \n\n"Griffons, ponies, citizens!", Silvertalon adressed his soldiers, "This is our time! The madgriff of Longsword hides in his city, fearful of our retribution. For too long has this unwarranted butchery been allowed to continue, and now we shall finish our task and reclaim our country! Glory and honour to the true defenders of Longsword!" \n\nWith the speech concluded, the solders set off to march on Swordsson, with the true ideals of Longsword in their hearts and minds. The war for Longsword has begun!"
longsword.56.a:0 "To arms!"

longsword.57.t:0 "Silvertalon's Triumph"
longsword.57.d:0 "Conrad Silvertalon stood in Swordsson's central square, now filled with rubble after heavy artillery bombardment. After a hard and brutal fight, the civil war for Longsword has been finally concluded in their favour. The Reformisten did not go down easily, as they used some truly despicable tactics, such as arming innocent griffon children and pretending to surrender numerous times. The mad Count himself was found barricaded in his residence, and was dragged out to the streets after a short struggle. He was summarily executed by the firing squad, screaming insults and curses as his last words. \n\nMeanwhile in the countryside, the remaining Partisans have agreed to peacefully surrender in exchange for amnesty. Their request was granted as they were fighting for their very existance - a just and noble endeavor, but now they've seen that they cannot bring their idea of change to Longsword after our victory. It will take a while to repair relations between griffons and ponies, following the years of sustained violence against the innocent ponies. \n\nSilvertalon addressed his griffons and ponies, telling them how proud he was of their courage in standing to up the cruel Reformisten, and finished by saying that our victory marks the beginning of a new age for a honourable Longsword, defender of the griffon way of life."
longsword.57.a:0 "Glory to Longsword!"

longsword.58.t:0 "School Reforms Take Root"
longsword.58.d:0 "The concept of educating our population has always been a difficult topic to discuss, given that a dangerous idea makes a dangerous griffon, and dangerous griffons make a dangerous society. But the world stops for nobody, and to best protect the Empire, we must adapt. An updated curriculum consisting of basic literacy skills, physical education, and our great Empire’s politics and history has been designed and distributed to the few schools dotted around nation, with new schools being built by the month. \nThough progress has been almost painfully slow, the program is finally starting to bear fruit. Our officers no longer have to deal with the troubles of teaching new recruits how to sound off in order, or properly grip a rifle, saving us a lot of time and heartache. \n\nNow only if they’d point those rifles in the right direction..."
longsword.58.a:0 "Great!"

longsword.59.t:0 "Functionally Educated"
longsword.59.d:0 "With the changing of the times comes the changing of our nation. The final school in our education plan has just completed construction and is set to open its doors next Monday, marking a critical milestone in our (measured) reform. Books have been printed, blackboards have been set up, and teachers have been trained. Our one-griffon education department has even conducted a surprise inspection a school in our capital, and to their surprise, the students could disarm an armed assailant from over 20 meters away, accurately describe most events in the Empire’s history, and some could even count to a hundred! Detractors of the program are now completely silent on the topic, if not coming out in support of the program - it seems like they’ve finally seen reason. To celebrate his success, our education minister has retired to his quarters tonight for a round of well-deserved festivities. \nTo the future! To the Griffons! To the Empire! \n\nHey, has anybody seen the general’s whisky?"
longsword.59.a:0 "Glorious!"

longsword.60.t:0 "The Fight Against Poverty"
longsword.60.d:0 "The generals have always known about the sorry state of our nation’s economy, as has every griffon on the continent, but it’s never become truly apparent until now, when a secretary’s attempt to order a replacement checkbook for the National Treasury went awry, being turned down by the only bank in the capital due to an inability to pay the replacement fee. Apparently foil-wrapped chocolate bits can look very similar to the real thing. Very, very similar. \nThe subsequent investigation has revealed many deep-rooted issues within our economy, namely a people almost entirely dependent on unstable sustenance farming, the total stagnation of monetary flow between businesses, and the inability to requisition any funding from the general population for lack of any funds to requisition. Not to mention, Dusktalon and his Reformisten cronies have been seizing without justification from the population their money and property for years... \nAn emergency policy meeting has resulted in a new plan of constructing additional military outposts to secure trade routes, importing foreign machinery to supplement our meagre industrial base, and adding a new agricultural service requirement to our national conscription terms. \n\nBoreas, let’s hope this works."
longsword.60.a:0 "Onwards!"

longsword.61.t:0 "Bit by Bit"
longsword.61.d:0 "News! And this time, it’s even good! \nFor the most part. \nThe politically-sensitive nature of protecting trade caravans is lost on our armies, ploughing fields is hard work for soldiers used to standing guard all day, and there are still no funds to requisition from our country’s griffons, but the programs are definitely beginning to show their effects. Villages are alive with the sounds of industry, markets are bustling and open for business, and for once in a long, long time, our nation can expect to come home to a warm meal after a hard day’s work. \nAnd while we’re still stuck growing wheat in gravel, at least now we won’t have to dig the holes with our bare claws. \n\nThat’s progress, right?"
longsword.61.a:0 "Brilliant!"

longsword.62.t:0 "The Plan Continues"
longsword.62.d:0 "A strong crowd of about 400 griffons gathered in Swordsson's central square, in front of the Count's residence. Count Dusktalon, speaking from his balcony, was in the middle of giving a fiery speech. \n\n"The ponies have brought nothing but ruin to Longsword! They refuse to accept their proper place, they refuse to acknowledge the superiority of the Griffon race! We cannot realise our full potential with their kind around, they must all be put to the sword!" \n\nAs his speech concluded, the riled up Reformisten began screaming for death to all the ponies and fired celebratory shots from their rifles to the sky. The dream of a pure Longsword would be fulfilled..."
longsword.62.a:0 "Wir werden unser Land rein machen!"

longsword.63.t:0 "Staffing the Army"
longsword.63.d:0 "For the longest time the military has been littered with spineless dirt griffons or even worse... Ponies. This cancer infests every level of the army, from top to bottom! If we're ever going to achieve our dream of a pure Longsword, we're going to start with rooting out filth from the most prestigious ranks of our beloved military... Which will of course be pivotal to our dream as well! We can't order the troops to eliminate those overgrown rats if one is leading them or worse, a pureblood Longswordian sympathizing with them! It'll be no issue swapping out these talentless fools with members of our own beloved organization. Reformisten members are the purest of Longsword, obviously we'd be the most fit to rule every office of government."
longsword.63.a:0 "A pure future requires a purified military."

longsword.64.t:0 "Honest Accidents"
longsword.64.d:0 "A little over a month has passed since we began eliminating impure elements of the military. The process has been rather swell with plenty of "loyal" pony officers being relieved of their station at the barrel of a gun. As expected, news of these dismissals haven't appeared as we can't have the prey throwing a tantrum at us retaking our country back. It's our birthright! These oversized rats have no place here, afterall. Though... Trouble in paradise has reared its ugly head in a few recent occasions where regular patrols and even training exercises have ended in deadly accidents for our new officers. \n\nBe it a patrol ending with some vile bandits, or lone communists shooting an officer dead, or a mortar test fire going way off trajectory and killing some key personnel there has been some sketchy incidents happening. We don't know exactly what's going on but it's a cause for alarm..."
longsword.64.a:0 "Accidents...?"

longsword.65.t:0 "Public Executions"
longsword.65.d:0 "The Army has been purged and effectively we call the shots now, literally. After a tedious month in waiting the time has arrived for our brand new pure minded Longsword military to roll out into the open public and begin a social purification of our enemies! Communist, pony, any other brand of traitor... All will be purged one way or another. From the public hourly hangings in the Capital, to the numerous executions happening in the countryside. There is plentiful mass graves to be filled, and more than enough ammunition for such a task. There will be no shortage of treasonous rats here, nor will there be a shortage of Reformisten warriors!"
longsword.65.a:0 "Death to the cancer of our country!"

longsword.66.t:0 "Partisan Reprisals"
longsword.66.d:0 "Well... We underestimated the strength of the resistance and it seems they were waiting for this moment to strike out. Barely a week has passed since we began our social cleansing, and already there has been numerous organised retaliations across the more disloyal provinces of the country. Town squares being overrun outright with any government workers or Reformisten members getting shot, hanged, or worse. These Partisan animals have struck hard in our moment of glory, we'll need to regroup and plan another string or executions lest we lose momentum and control of the situation. \n\nThe Resistance is a very, very real threat..."
longsword.66.a:0 "...Wait, just a..."

longsword.67.t:0 ""Mysterious" Disapperances"
longsword.67.d:0 "Things just went from bad to worse, reports are now coming in from across the country of multiple key personnel going missing for any array of reasons. Apparent abandonment of station, tall tales of pursuing forbidden love, anti-partisan operations going wrong... The list goes on! There's far too many of these reports to even count off as genuine too... it's... almost as if... \n\nThat's it! The military is still compromised! Our previous month's purges were not enough to contain this cancer, there is no other solution then for another round! There is no other explanation for these numerous "disappearances" than to proclaim we have not been thorough enough... \n\nWe must act quick, in fact quick is an understatement! We must act now!"
longsword.67.a:0 "...Moment."

longsword.68.t:0 "Bureaucratic Cleanup"
longsword.68.d:0 "Much like the army, the bureaucracy is littered with vile ponies and equine sympathizing Longswordians. If not for the Reformisten, the entirety of Longsword's government would be overrun with these traitors in the span of a decade! If we're going to undo the damage done we'll need to work fast. There is plentiful pure-bred griffons willing to serve the country in its best interest, and there is still plenty traitors to replace. For a pure future we'll need a pure government!"
longsword.68.a:0 "With the traitors gone, we can finally run this nation properly!"

longsword.69.t:0 "Bureaucratic Collapse"
longsword.69.d:0 "Astonishingly... Governmental efficiency has taken a complete nosedive. Tax collectors are collecting for themselves and not the Government. Governors are propping up ridiculous laws on a whim with no grounding in reality. The Foreign Relations Department is in complete collapse. Newly emplaced town officials have directed government money into their own bank accounts and if they haven't; they have not a clue as to what to do. Nearly every recently replaced position has been filled by a Reformisten member that either has little experience for the job, ill-intents for their duty, or... Both of those issues! Did nobody do a screening process for this!?"
longsword.69.a:0 "That wasn't meant to happen..."

longsword.70.t:0 "A Lesson to the Disloyal"
longsword.70.d:0 "In order to properly create the pure Longswordian state we promised to our fellow griffons, we must appropriate the now illegally owned pony businesses and property to be better handled by loyal Longswordian citizens. Of course much of these lands and buildings will have to be operated by the government until a buyer is found, regardless of whichever it will still be better for the country at large. Ponies can never be trusted and have no business owning property or amassing any notable amount of wealth. \n\nFortunately enough we managed to bust a rising pony-dominant business district local to the city of Haarsingen too! If not for our intervention, there's no telling how much worse that infection would've gotten..."
longsword.70.a:0 "Now we can put those factories to good use!"

longsword.71.t:0 "An Explosion in Haarsingen"
longsword.71.d:0 "As of this morning, merely two days after the seizure of Haarsingen's "Sunny Days" industrial district a series of explosions went off. The series, type, and areas of damage were all too organised to have been some freak accident. The ensuing explosion proceeded to collapse numerous levels of the factory before it ultimately fell in on itself from lack of support pillars. Fortunately only a lone safety inspector died, but there remains the question of how this happened... Some local loyal supporters reported the owner, "Sunny Day" was staunchly anti-Reformisten and had a history of explosives experience. If it's anyone's guess, he set up remote explosives to level his wrongly acquired property. Why didn't this come up when we were screening him and all the others earlier in the week? Someone find this rat and KILL him!"

longsword.74.d:0 ""This is a nightmare, it's an absolute nightmare!", Count Dusktalon wailed as he sat at his desk. Face in claws as he sobbed pitifully. His best laid plans had backfired every step of the way. "Every precaution was taken! The traitorous elements in the army were eliminated to begin with!", he continued to rant and wave. His ever trusty second in command, Rosa Heidenreich stood idle by the door with her lips pursed into a slight frown, gaze averted from the pitiful state of her benefactor and leader. "We massacred them by the hundreds! By the THOUSANDS, Arcturius damn them all!" \n\nRosa's right claw tightened into a firm fist as this went on and on and... on! The Count had always been her benefactor and truly she appreciated it, but as time progressed, it was a grim reality to realize how awful of a leader Dusktalon really was. She agreed with his dreams but his methods? Inefficient, unstable, unadaptive! Maybe she'd be best fit for the role...but such traitorous thoughts were often eliminated from her mind. But she couldn't lie, it was beginning to become increasingly difficult to push such thoughts out of her mind as they appeared near daily now. \n\nSuddenly enough the Count's fist slammed down onto his table hard enough to shake everything sitting upon it. His favourite snowglobe falling off its edge and onto the floor to shatter into pieces. He hadn't shed a tear over it shockingly enough, his mind was focused on larger things. "Rally my staff! Rally the commanders! Rally everyone! The Reformisten will not stand for this offence, and for that we will strike back tenfold for every dent put into our plans!", the Count bellowed loud and proud, enough so to catch Rosa's direct attention finally. "Rosa, if you'll excuse me I have to clean up here, now go. Time is of the essence!" \n\nShe would've offered words of wisdom in how this wasn't the best response to these incidents but she knew he was too set in his ways. Still, he was her superior and as such she had to continue following his orders... Unfortunately. "Of course, my Count.""

Even with a prepared defense of Zeldstadt it was not enough as Silvertalon's forces were larger than we had ever expected. The Reformisten's forces have been stretched thin and we're in a very terrible position.

His orders were clear, his subordinates were loyal and willing, he brought purity to Longsword! Quickly, he remembered - those damned ponies, they were the cause behind everything! The factories, Silvertalon, the arms shipments, his standing with von Katerinburg - everything! Somehow, their corrupting magic seeped into every aspect of his nation. \n\nDusktalon reached for the drawer and took his reliable pistol.

Even the victorious Reformisten were starting to have second thoughts about this plan, but they were kept in check by their zealous superiors. Longsword was purified... at a heavy cost. \n\nThe hastily erected fortifications of Zeldstadt were no match for the Reformisten onslaught, as they broke through and mercilessly slaughtered the loyalist soldiers. Conrad Silvertalon was found in his room, lying dead at the command table, pistol in his claws. The surviving commanders were quickly executed. \n\nVisaginas' forests were burning as the Reformisten were driving out the ponies, by any means necessary. For all their effort, Starry Night and most of the Partisans were able to flee across the border to Lake City, their escape covered by ponies and griffons who sacrificed themselves to enable it. In the end, it could reasonably be said not a single pony was left in Longsword. \n\nAfter all these years, setbacks and outright revolts, Count Pallas Dusktalon considered his dream fulfilled. Sure, he had to destroy most of the country to accomplish that, but did that matter once von Katerinburg learned of his success? Surely he'd get richly rewarded, maybe even gain a higher title! Now all that's left is for Rosa Heidenreich to send the letter to Hellquill, reporting of their success. \n\nOn the other claw, Rosa herself was feeling disillusioned by this outcome. The Reformisten cause is self destructive, they have no future... Perhaps she can still make the final decision of this civil war."

While Dusktalon is known to be a coward and a blowhard, the fact remains that the Reformisten are the winners in the Longswordian civil war. It's anyone's guess how he had managed to win, but nonetheless plans have been drawn to quickly integrate the Longswordian lands into our own, so that together we may prepare for the final conflict against the ponies..."

I haven't summoned you." The group exchanged quick glances before Heidenreich spoke: "Dusktalon, this cannot go on anymore. The country is ruined, we went too far and accomplished nothing worth boasting about. It is time for you to step down", disappointment clear in her tone. \n\nThe nerve of this griffon! He has achieved his dream and so much more, and now she wants to throw it all away?! He stood up and started screeching: "Heidenreich, how dare you intefere in our sacred du-", but he didn't get to finish as one of the conspirators shot him in the head. \n\nWord of this event quickly spread, and anarchy ensued as the Reformisten turned on each other in brutal infighting. The following week saw many violence and destruction of what was left in Longsword, until a semblance of order was restored by Heidenreich and her close supporters.

Her genuine belief in its movement served well in having her climb up to the top of it with ease. The last thing she'd have thought is how its rise ultimately led to the fall of Longsword as a nation state - a civilized one at least. She was to be an upstanding lady of the nation! Now her days were spent living off the work of others she'd stolen from. Of all things she felt she'd have been as a small girl, being a leader of bandits wasn't even a consideration. \n\nThis had gone on for months now even, weeks of pointless existence off of the backs of others weaker than her. It was... emotionally grating, demoralizing even. Nothing impressed her anymore and life had come to a standstill even as it continued on.

Life seemed to be treating her like a toy with all the curveballs it'd thrown throughout the last few years.

Such things often led to less-than-pleasant outcomes, but instead she and her underlings had run into the monarch of the neighboring mountainous Sunstriker clan, Eriviar. He had consensually pursued a far more violent and passionate path in his life too as of recent times in his pursuit of the Griffon God, Maar. Such deeds led him to continue the outdated lifestyle of raiding one's neighbors for desired goods. Of all birds Rosa could've run into, Eriviar near instantly became one she'd not forget. His forces were nearly the same size and similarly equipped if not worse off, yet his troops had garnered twice as much loot as she had. She knew well that she'd caught his eye considering it was he who insisted on stopping to converse in professing interest in her.

longsword.82.d_maar:0 ""Her eyes... as rich and blue as the sea itself! How could I ever forget them? A lady able to hold herself so well in such a harsh environment? Surely a daughter of Maar without any doubt in my heart!" Eriviar had thought to himself in the passing weeks after his chance encounter with the de-facto leader of what was considered Longsword. Life after his eye opening coma had been hurried and busy. No time to look over the little things such as the matters of his heart. His eyes had always been on that of the state of his worship of Maar, the being who'd made his path clear for his clan. But this girl of Longsword? This Rosa? She was something else, so beautiful and strong! Her last name... what was it? Heidenreich? Even a name such as that carried power with it! Eriviar's mind had become consumed with thoughts of this girl. So much infatuation... he had to release it all somehow, otherwise Maar may smite him for his lack of faith recently with his mind elsewhere constantly. \n\nHe took to solving this dilemma in the form of letter writing. In words he described all the feelings he'd possessed lately regarding Rosa, be it admiration, romantic want, or anything else that came to mind regarding her. He cared not for fear of rejection, simply to ease himself of these emotions he'd gained. Much to his surprise the letter he'd sent was soon returned with a response from Rosa. One that was not negative in the slightest, while perhaps not nearly as heart filled as his own, the beautiful griffon had written an interest of her own in him. Perhaps Eriviar may have found the only other being who could ever exist in his heart alongside Maar..."
longsword.82.d_not_maar:0 "Her name fit perfectly the nature of her appearance. Rosa Heidenreich! Ms. Heidenreich! Oh Lady Heidenreich... Eriviar couldn't get the girl out of her head ever since turning home after running into her just a few weeks prior. Up until this point he'd been so focused on his purpose in creating a better life for the members of his clan. But never did he take a step back to think for what'd be best for himself. This included his complete abandonment of doing anything leisurely for himself for the greater good of the country... by extension he'd lived quite the lonely existence relationship speaking. He had no time to even entertain his passing sexual moods on some fair maiden, the King had been utterly chaste! His mind never dwelled into such matters... at least until meeting this bird of Longsword - what's left of it at least. \n\nHe couldn't help himself but take to pen and paper to describe the feelings he'd been having. The sensations which Rosa was now causing him to have just by the very thought of her! He couldn't care for the idea of this backfiring or being rejected, he needed it out of his system. He needed to tell her, and he finally needed to know how she felt in return. The end result was nothing less than what the King could've asked for when he received a response detailing Lady Heidenreich's mutual acceptance of such romantic interest. While it was obvious she was far more reluctant than he was... Eriviar now knew there was a chance between them."

While some of the male's productivity had returned, it wasn't much, still he had maintained his earnest desire for Rosa. Even more so did he desire to treat her to a better life, surely such a strong female deserves a far better lifestyle! With this in mind Eriviar took it upon himself to round together the slaves acquired from a recent raid along with a decent chunk of materials and other supplies to send off south towards his beloved Rosa. It might've not been something extravagant but anything is better than nothing."
longsword.83.d_not_maar:0 "There was a jovial step in Eriviar's movements for the passing month. The positive reaction from his beloved Rosa has sent the young King into one of the most productive periods of the passing year! Previously he'd been stressed and at times saddened over his inability to find a romantic interest, now such things were utterly absent from his thoughts. Rosa's repeated replies to his own letters of desire had given the male a boost to his confidence to boot. He'd always been confident but knowing even in the romantic field he held prominence? Perfection! To privately appreciate the Longswordian he'd come to want so  much he discreetly redirected a supply train filled with slaves and quite the amount of loot from a recent raid south towards Longsword, to his Rosa."

Good news after good news it seemed, though he hadn't expected this to be the best news as when reading the violent King's heart was instantly melted from the unexpected invite by Rosa to visit Longsword himself for an "evening of fun" as she had written it. On one claw this was exactly what Eriviar would've wished for... on the other claw he had been ignoring his duties for Maar quite often ever since his obsession with Rosa formed."

Finding a lovely bird who might just be the final part to complete Eriviar's life. More good news soon arrived in the form of yet another letter from Rosa. This time she'd thanked him for the gift he'd sent previously and... offered to invite him down to her home for festivities! The servants of his Palace were treated to a strange sight when their King read over this as they'd see him jump with glee at the proposal.

She'd barely done a thing besides return his affections and already she had him right in her claws. The truth was she did feel a love in return for him, a strong one at that to boot. Enough so that after receiving his latest gift she was driven to preparing a great feast for him to partake in. In fact the feast became a front of her ultimate plan of tying the knot with him... literally. Nothing better than alcohol, food, party games, and competition to get a male relaxed enough for intimacy. Initially sure, Eriviar wanted her... but now? Rosa NEEDED him. All she had to do was find the time and place to propose the question... and the time had finally come in this moment, tonight."

Not only had he fulfilled his duties to his deity and been rewarded plentifully, he too had possibly found a bride befitting of his station to boot. The aforementioned beauty returning his interest in force to the point of inviting him to Longsword for what'd effectively be a festival almost purely out of his arrival there. Rosa had taken a liking to Eriviar... perhaps as much as he'd taken to her now. This was obviously the case as during the festivities she simply couldn't keep her eyes off him, and refused to be away from him for long. Eriviar appreciated... nay, basked in the attention. That alongside of showing off in the competitions he'd partake in, the young King even winning the shooting one he'd participated in. Though as the night went on Eriviar soon found himself... alone with just the pretty Longswordian. It was here he was asked quite the loaded question by Rosa. Its importance was great despite its simple stature. "Mead in my room, Milord?", she cooed gleefully with a suggestive wink, it didn't take Maar's intellect to tell where this might be going."
longsword.88.d_not_maar:0 "The nation at large was well, and now their King's mind was at ease too. It was a subtle crime that Eriviar continued administering the nation in his previous lonely state. What is a country's good health if the leader who tends to its health remains poor and decaying? Rosa was a great help for Eriviar. Initially his advisors would've felt she'd be nothing more than a cash sink that'd eventually burn Eriviar emotionally when she'd extracted enough value out of him. But they all grew quiet when it was she who offered to invite him to Longsword for a leisure trip. Some remained skeptical of the King's trip to bandit country but... considering Rosa's reputation it'd be unlikely anyone would try offending her - especially her own home turf. His arrival had a warm greeting from all those involved, an especially warm one from Rosa in the form of a hug and quite bold peck on the beak. Griffons might've not been able to kiss like equine did, but the touching of beaks established well enough the symbolism of it. \n\nEriviar embraced the attention wholeheartedly. He had little complaints of Rosa's overly warm advances or the fact she'd practically been hanging on his arm the whole evening. The girl shameless to show off her apparent attraction to Eriviar at this point - it wasn't like her underlings were going to poke fun... not without risk of losing their tongues. The festivities went forth far into the evening... though eventually Eriviar found himself alone with his lady Heidenreich. Less than a minute passed into that and already the two held each other's claws warmly. Eyes connecting with the oncoming silence speaking just as loud as words could. Eventually Rosa broke the silence to speak. "Mean in my room, Milord?", with the ever telling wink. Eriviar knew what his lady desired... the question then became, is now the right time?"

longsword.89.d:0 "Her plan had succeeded. Her meek little question of sharing some mead gave fruit to the greater whole of her desires as moments later she excitedly dragged Eriviar off by the claw through numerous hallways and towards her room. Despite Longsword's reputation to outsiders the little devilish woman had created quite the comfy home for herself in the capital's remnants. Of all the surrounding desolation her headquarters and de facto "Palace" provided any comfort one could expect in more civilized countries. Lady Heidenreich's room was no different as it possessed an overly luxurious bedding she'd no doubt stolen from some poor Firtreeian pony or Griffonian noble along with plentiful furniture. Even if she had to work like a low-class ruffian she sure strived to live like an upper-class lady of stature now. She'd dress like one too... privately and publicly when viable. \n\nEriviar soon learned of this as he entered his lady's room first and followed her simple orders to get comfortable. He undressed some, merely taking off his dress jacket to hang it up before moving to sit down atop the head of her large bedding. It'd be less than a minute or so passing before the blue-eyed beauty returned in... quite the scanty array of lingerie. It was definitely something fabricated in Skyfall by the looks of it, the fanciful black silk came in the form of stockings over her hindlegs that went all the way up, further inspection showed it'd been a garter belt too. Though most alarmingly was the fact her... groin was completely exposed. The sight of such shameless nudity caused a blush to form on Eriviar's cheeks. "Milord." She hummed forebodingly, Eriviar's heart rate was quick to ramp up. He'd believed he'd be drinking mead, however... it now seemed that he'd be tasting something else tonight. Something that'd been on his mind for quite some time."

How lucky was he to have a pure Longswordian lady such as herself offer to commit to such crass deeds - and still he declined! Rosa initially attempted to force a smile that became increasingly awkward. But barely a minute passed before the façade broke and she brazenly smacked King right on the cheek. Eriviar was shocked and stunned as it occurred. "Fiend! You lead me on like this for what? What a waste!" She exclaimed and stormed off from him, he couldn't tell if she'd be choking back tears or not as she did. But for what it was she was pissed at him, had he really been that lustful as to give this griffoness such sultry signals? Perhaps he was at fault for this... but he couldn't know, Rosa had already stormed off to be alone. Hopefully this doesn't escalate further... the circumstances were private, after all.

"Oh my lovely Eriviar, I know it is so early into our romance but I believe you are the one! I've not held so much love and desire for another in the few decades I've lived, surely you feel the same? It's only fitting we bind our souls together eternally in marriage!" The written words burned themselves into Eriviar's retinas... things had progressed so fast and now it was out of his control! Is this really what he wanted? Though...at the same time it was flattering that it was her who did more of the heavy lifting. She knew what she wanted...and what she wanted was him, but was she who HE wanted?"

She'd sent out some of her goons weeks in advance to the West in seeking some fanciful wedding gown directly from the stores of Skyfall and they'd arrived on time for today as well. A bit rushed to fit everything but nothing impossible... and really she did look beautiful. She hadn't often worn white but in an event like this a lady such as herself shouldn't go outside the norm. The day was a haze for her as things progressed quickly, she was a schoolgirl once more with how giddy she'd be! Time went by so quickly that before she knew it, she stood right next to Eriviar at the alter being read their vows. Each asked vow being returned with a resounding..."

Two of Rosa's attendants spoke between themselves as they delivered the King's response to Rosa's bold marriage. They'd managed to open it flawlessly and read the answer ahead of time before delivering the letter with their boss likely to never know. The answer was a stoic and cruel decline from him. After all the letters they'd share and recent time they'd had with one another, it'd been for naught. Mere seconds after the two had spoken to one another they'd hear a loud "WHAT?!" in quite the high pitched voice crack from within Rosa's room. She now knew the King's answer and... very obviously she wasn't happy in the slightest. "Go. GO!" One of the two spoke in a hurried and anxious whisper as they each abandoned their posts to be as far away from the bombshell brewing in that room. The two felt plenty bad for whoever might cross her path in the coming hours... or weeks to come. As they left they could hear a mirror shatter faintly behind her closed door, one could say lady Heidenreich wasn't taking this too well."
longsword.93.a:0 "W-we had something, didn't we?! How could this be!"

longsword.94.t:0 "The Wedding"
longsword.94.d:0 "Such an immense amount of stress hung on Eriviar's head now. He had to make sure everything was just right for this monumental day. Rosa might've taken the lead but it was clear who still took on most of the stress in the relationship now. He'd accepted the proposal happily and scattered to find a proper engagement band and later wedding ring to give his betrothed. Not to mention gathering the members of his family in the isolated mountain ranges of his nation... and finding a place to hold the ceremony... and... and... the poor fellow had quite the workload. It quickly became where running a nation wasn't nearly as difficult as organizing a wedding. Maybe it was just the expectations and anxiety of having to impress Rosa one last time. Things had to be perfect otherwise maybe she won't want him anymore! Of course chances are Rosa wouldn't be so petty but... he couldn't take chances. When the day finally came the only smile Eriviar could manage half the time was a forced one unlike Rosa who'd been grinning like a giddy schoolgirl the whole time. Only when the procession finally came and the two stood before the altar did Eriviar finally relax. His face softening into a genuine smile as he turned to face his eternally beloved. Each vow asked of him being replied with a clear..."
longsword.94.a:0 "I do!"

longsword.95.t:0 "Teaching the Illiterate"
longsword.95.d:0 "It's no secret that the collapsed state of Longsword's government means there's no government programs in place. Which means there's no public education, which means kids aren't going to school... which means nobody can read, which means IQ levels have dropped dramatically, which means Longsword's denizens look like barbarians now. There's no hope for those still in power to fight illiteracy the moral and logical way of teaching the masses how to read and write. HOWEVER, that doesn't mean we can't take their citizenship away from them! Can't say Longsword has a high illiteracy rate if only citizens who ARE literate can be such! Of course those within the nation which aren't citizens are merely homeless squatters with no loyalty to the state! They'd make perfect candidates for the new bauxite deposits our surveyors recently discovered..."
longsword.95.a:0 "Look at those illiteracy rates drop!"

longsword.96.t:0 "Illiteracy Eradicated"
longsword.96.d:0 "Honestly? It's pretty monstrous what was just did over the past few months. But if it works, it works... and none will be the wiser just a mere decade from now. That's like... not even a blink in the march of history! We've now successfully "eradicated" illiteracy from our "happy" society. Every Longswordian citizen can successfully read and write and now we have one of the lowest illiteracy percentiles on the continent! Not to mention we've also begun producing quite the amount of processed aluminium which will no doubt help jumpstart the economy, as we FINALLY have a good that others want! There will be no shortage of workers in the bauxite mines considering the amount of illegal migrants we've discovered to be encroaching on rightfully owned government land... They don't have rights, and creatures without rights get turned into slaves!"
longsword.96.a:0 "Magnificent!"

longsword.98.t:0 "[From.GetName] Wishes to Reestablish Relations"
longsword.98.d:0 "An envoy garbed in the traditional colours of old Knightly Orders has appeared today in the Imperial Palace. Offering their respects to the Regent and the Emperor, the envoy introduced himself as hailing from Longsword, one of the eastern frontier states. After a bloody civil war, the military loyalists have prevailed and have reestablish the country in their image, honour and tradition being the code of law again. They've voiced their concerns about extremist elements in the Riverlands, and desire to remake the ancient treaties that binded us, with them providing a buffer territory against any pony incursions. How shall we respond to this?"
longsword.98.a:0 "The stalwart defenders of the East are welcome to join us."
longsword.98.b:0 "The ponies of the East are not a concern."

longsword.99.t:0 "[From.GetName] Accepts Our Oaths"
longsword.99.d:0 "The Empire has officially agreed to our offer of servitude, and has extended their protection over us."
longsword.99.a:0 "The Order returns to its duty."

longsword.100.t:0 "[From.GetName] Declines"
longsword.100.d:0 "The Empire has declined to recognise us as their subject!"
longsword.100.a:0 "What happens now?"

longsword.101.t:0 "Civil War in Longsword"
longsword.101.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]The County of Longsword has been under the rule of the Reformisten faction of the griffon knights. These Reformisten have been cruelly persecuting the local ponies, while failing to address any of the other issues in their nation. Unrest has been brewing in the nation for some time now, with the ponies forming an organised resistance against the Reformisten. Rumour has it some griffons, fed up with their government’s atrocious behaviour, have joined the ponies in the struggle. Meanwhile, general Conrad Silvertalon has used the opportunity to revolt as well. Leading the saner elements of the knights and the military, he hopes to remind the Longswordians of their duty. Pallas Dusktalon, the Reformisten Count of Longsword, has denounced all his enemies, struggling to scramble his meagre forces."
longsword.101.a:0 "Kill them all!"
longsword.101.b:0 "To victory!"
longsword.101.c:0 "For freedom!"
longsword.101.e:0 "Dusktalon finally lost control..."
longsword.101.f:0 "I hope the ponies will be okay."
longsword.101.g:0 "Another bloody civil war..."

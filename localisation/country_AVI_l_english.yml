### FOCUS LOCALISATION ####################
###########################################
avian:0 "House Avian Focus Tree"
convene_the_council:0 "Convene the House Council"
convene_the_council_desc:0 "It is a time of crisis. In the lands of the ailing Empire, unruly vassals connive secession, whilst the Emperor's health grows worse by the day. To the east, Aquileia teeters on the brink of another civil war. To the south, the expansionist Wingbardy and her allies hungrily eye their neighbours. House Avian is surrounded by enemies, and a new strategy is needed if the House is to survive the turbulent years to come."
go_with_count_ehrenreich:0 "Go with Count Ehrenreich"
go_with_count_ehrenreich_desc:0 "Count Ehrenreich and his policy of armed neutrality is the way forward. Only through isolation will House Avian be safe from the madness outside its borders."
go_with_viceroy_joachim:0 "Go with Viceroy Joachim"
go_with_viceroy_joachim_desc:0 "Viceroy Joachim and his ideal of a union between the Three Great Houses of the Griffonian Heartlands is the path to Avian greatness, and protection from the great powers that would seek to engulf us."
proclamation_of_neutrality:0 "Proclamation of Avian Neutrality"
proclamation_of_neutrality_desc:0 "Whilst House Avian has remained neutral and aloof from any conflicts since its secession from the Empire, its neutrality has never been officially acknowledged. Declaring our intention to remain neutral in future conflicts will hopefully insulate us from the worst of the wars to come."
intergigantes:0 "Avian Intergigantes"
intergigantes_desc:0 "House Avian sits at the epicentre between three belligerent nations - the Empire, Aquileia, and Wingbardy. Trapped between the giants, House Avian must unite with its fellow Houses or perish."
pursue_true_neutrality:0 "Pursue True Neutrality"
pursue_true_neutrality_desc:0 "The feuding houses of Eyrie and Erie will never be able to put aside their differences, even to face a common foe. Like it or not, House Avian will have to go it alone; there is no point in bedding a corpse, even if there are two of them."
overtures_erie:0 "Overtures to House Erie"
overtures_erie_desc:0 "We lack a permanent representative within the court of House Erie, and any communication between House Avian and one of our officials is terribly slow. By establishing an embassy we will solve both problems in a single stroke."
overtures_eyrie:0 "Overtures to House Eyrie"
overtures_eyrie_desc:0 "Communication with House Eyrie, despite being neighbours, is problematic even at the best of times. Installing a diplomat from our house will ease these issues and open up new diplomatic options with House Eyrie."
pursue_economic_cooperation:0 "Pursue Economic Cooperation"
pursue_economic_cooperation_desc:0 "Alone, our economic might is paltry compared to those of larger nations. Only by forming new trade and economic deals between our houses will we stand to make an impression in the global stage."
promote_interhouses_fraternisation:0 "Promote Inter-House Fraternisation"
promote_interhouses_fraternisation_desc:0 "The once Great Houses of the Griffon Heartlands have long since fallen apart into tribalist factionalism that has only served to drive a wedge between our people. We are all griffons, and we are all griffons of the realms of the Three Houses."
student_exchange_program:0 "Student Exchange Program"
student_exchange_program_desc:0 "Looking closely at the different schools between the three houses, one is hard-pressed to find significant differences in the way that we teach and what our cubs learn. A way to nip the inter-house disdain would be to show our students just how similar we all are."
three_houses_corporation:0 "Three Houses Corporation"
three_houses_corporation_desc:0 "Previously one of the better examples of our houses’ capacity to cooperate, the Three Houses Corporation can expand its scope into research and development if we encourage further investments from all three houses."
relax_citizenship_requirements:0 "Relax Citizenship Requirements"
relax_citizenship_requirements_desc:0 "Ancient Heartlands families have been forced apart due to the stringent citizenship requirements and travel permits between the houses’ territories. Loosening some of these restrictions is not only morally the right thing, but a pragmatic move on having our people warm up to the idea of a single realm of the Three Houses."
scientific_exchange_program:0 "Scientific Exchange Program"
scientific_exchange_program_desc:0 "Each of the Three Houses have had their own research programmes that diverged and would often be contrary to the betterment of the Heartlands themselves. By allowing free movements of scientists and unifying our efforts, the Heartlands can begin to form a new hub of scholarly endeavours in Griffonia."
common_markets_agreement:0 "Common Market Agreement"
common_markets_agreement_desc:0 "With successful deals between the Three Houses bringing in wealth to every griffon, it only stands to reason that further economic integration will allow for greater prosperity among the Houses."
security_cooperation:0 "Inter-House Security Cooperation"
security_cooperation_desc:0 "We stand alone against the menace around our realms. Once the storm washes over our lands, the Houses must heed the call to stand as one."
three_colleges:0 "Support the Tripartite College"
three_colleges_desc:0 "With coalescing curriculums, there’s no reason why we cannot form a single curriculum offered by a single college. A Tripartite College will further bolster a sense of unity among our generations and instil an identity not determined of the realm of the House they are from, but of our single inter-house entity."
ending_the_rivalry:0 "Ending the Rivalry"
ending_the_rivalry_desc:0 "The feud between House Eire and House Eyrie have continually been a hindrance to a unified House Realm, and any hope to achieve that dream starts with an end to the rivalry. Let us begin the arduous process, for a better future for our people."
annual_hunting_trip:0 "The Annual Hunting Trip"
annual_hunting_trip_desc:0 "The time is upon us: the yearly hunting trip where most of the House Avian nobles shall leave for the countryside. With all of the doom and gloom that permeates the courts, it is refreshing for the members of said courts to unwind and get in touch with their predator side. Hunting never got anyone killed, anyways."
weekly_luncheons:0 "Weekly Luncheons"
weekly_luncheons_desc:0 "The best way for rivals to get over their feud is to force them to see and treat each other as equals. House Avian can arrange for weekly lunches for members of both House Eire and House Eyrie. The first few events will be messy, but who knows? At least everyone will have a laugh."
winterfest_ball:0 "The Winterfest Ball"
winterfest_ball_desc:0 "The Winterfest Ball is a House Erie tradition, and has never seen a single member of House Eyrie attend since the start of their bloody rivalry. With proper preparations, we can break this sad streak and demonstrate just how far the two houses have come in mending their relationship."
scion_swap:0 "The Scion Swap"
scion_swap_desc:0 "Tensions have diminished between House Erie and House Eyrie, but there are many that are sceptical of a lasting peace. What better way to tie the two houses together via the exchange of two highborn noble scions?  Montague Eyrie, Earl of Verenia, and Lady Rosaline Erie of Bantry have demonstrated an interest in this exchange."
treaty_of_friendship:0 "Eyrie-Erie Treaty of Friendship"
treaty_of_friendship_desc:0 "Bread was broken and shared, love has bloomed, and plenty of laughs were had between House Erie and House Eyrie. Were one to see these two houses interact without knowing their history, they would find it difficult to believe that they were ever at each other’s throats. It is time to declare the Eyrie-Erie feud as officially over."
the_intergigantes_tripartite:0 "The Intergigantes Tripartite"
the_intergigantes_tripartite_desc:0 "With no further bad blood blocking the way, House Avian can finally set about to uniting the House Realms with an alliance that shall last forever or until the last griffon of the realms breathes their last. May our friendship last for decades!"

AVI_common_markets:0 "Tripartite Common Market Agreement"
AVI_common_markets_desc:0 "The ratification of the Tripartite Common Market Agreement by the Three Houses has officially allowed for the close integration of their national economies, boosting economic growth by enforcing protectionist policies against foreign nations whilst greatly liberalising trade between the Three Houses. Although there arises from time to time occasional skirmishs or border wars between Houses Erie and Eyrie, the neutral House Avian acts as an arbitrator and so prevents the agreement from falling apart - an advantegeous, if somewhat convoluted, state of affairs that all three Houses, despite their differences, are happy to maintain."

The bitter feud between the rival houses of Eyrie and Erie - both houses as irreconcilable to each other as the Sun and Moon, Day and Night - has led to decades of incessant internecine violence between the two heavily militarised houses. Although no one is certain about how or when the feud originated, one thing is certain: the bloodshed will continue if something is not done."

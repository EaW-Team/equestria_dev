AVI_relaxd_citizenship:0 "Relaxed Citizenship Requirements"
AVI_econcoop:0 "Interhouse Economic Cooperation"
AVI_common_markets:0 "Tripartite Common Market Agreement"
AVI_common_markets_desc:0 "The ratification of the Tripartite Common Market Agreement by the Three Houses has officially allowed for the close integration of their national economies, boosting economic growth by enforcing protectionist policies against foreign nations whilst greatly liberalising trade between the Three Houses. Although there arises from time to time occasional skirmishs or border wars between Houses Erie and Eyrie, the neutral House Avian acts as an arbitrator and so prevents the agreement from falling apart - an advantegeous, if somewhat convoluted, state of affairs that all three Houses, despite their differences, are happy to maintain."

dread_start.10.t:0 "???"
dread_start.10.d:0 "The long night had reached its peak when The First arrived. "The Famine is nearly upon us. Yet you still wait. Do you not understand the severity of inaction?"\n\nThe Architect preceded many, but was still bound by familial bonds to answer The First's call. "I do. Patience will be rewarded with a Feast, my beloved."\n\nThe First scoffed at this. "Patience will only get us so far. Already many of the Lesser have succumbed, yet the Famine itself hasn't even arrived. The plan must be set in motion. Now."\n\n"Just a little while longer," reassured the Architect, "I have been grooming the Heir for most of its life. It will be the perfect Vessel to bring about the Feast. All that remains is for the Fool to be removed, and for the Heir to take its place."\n\n"Do not presume that you can put off my demands until later. Yet I see this plan of yours is not without merit. You have until the Heir's mortal coil is extinguished. If your plan is not enacted by that point, then I shall see that you suffer the same fate the Lesser."\n\nThe First departed, leaving the Architect alone to watch over the night once more. "Perhaps..." mused the Architect, "Perhaps the Heir could use a little push in the right direction.""
dread_start.10.a:0 "Fear not the Dark..."

dread_start.101.t:0 "Dread Calling"
dread_start.101.d:0 ""Curious..." mused the ancient lich. He stood outside his chamber; the door in front of him was ajar. The lich peered inside, but found nothing out of the ordinary, save for a parchment laying atop his desk. He levitated it towards him so that he could inspect it further, and saw that it was written in the long-forgotten language found within the tomes of Magehold's Library. Surely it couldn't be...\n\n"Corpus Maledictus,\nYou have performed your role as Dread King admirably in the years since your predecessor had perished. The time has come for a new age, one which will usher in a world of magic never before seen by mortals. Naturally, an immortal like yourself should be the one to bring about this power to your eternal kingdom. Carnes, Sanguis, Fidelis, Luvenis. All have served their purpose, and now it is time for you to serve yours as well.\nMORDATOR commands you to break open the Third Seal. The following words of power will grant you the ability to breach the magical barrier guarding a power unlike any you have ever seen before..."\n\nAs Corpus read the esoteric phrases contained within the parchment, he turned his head upwards and began to cackle. He had never been that devout during his time in the Ossuary, but he still believed that Mordator watched over him. Now he had proof."
dread_start.101.a:0 ""Finally, the recognition that I deserve.""

dread_start.20.t:0 "The Magisterium's Librarian"
dread_start.20.d:0 "Ornate candles illuminated the chambers of the Library of Magehold. Many scholars and mages could be seen roaming the halls, studying and organizing the countless preserved tomes that predated even the oldest immortals in this corner of the world. Throughout the vast underground labyrinth, creatures living and unliving alike could be found roaming the halls of this sanctum of knowledge. There were mostly ponies with the occasional griffon here and there, though members of other races have visited the Magisterium over the millennia.\n\nHowever, one scholar was not looking for a book, but for the eldest creature in the Dread League: the fabled Librarian himself. Wearing her signature robe that indicated membership of the Dread Council, Tutor Libri trotted through the halls, passing by a pair of mages examining one of the many magical seals blocking off sections of the Library. Though a significant number of minor seals had been broken by the Librarian, some even by other mages, countless more still hid vast sections of the Library. The place was already a maze to begin with; each month, the maps needed to be updated with newly accessible areas.\n\nShe had an inkling of where to find the Librarian, though. As she made her way to the grand spiral staircase that separated the major sections of the Library, she saw a magnificent glow from below. When she descended, she was met with a lone, ghastly pony sitting in front of the glimmering magical barrier. Third Great Seal. Beyond it was... who knows? Something comparable to the power of liches and vampires, that's for sure. Tutor cleared her throat, stepping forward towards the ragged lich, "Vetus, staring at the barrier won't help you figure out how to breach it. Come, study with us, and inspiration will come to you in due time."\n\nIf Vetus heard her, then he didn't seem to acknowledge her. Tutor was about to clear her throat again when she heard Vetus' old, decrepit voice croak, "Time is short, the wind is coming. Death itself may die, but one thing is certain: when the future is suffering, all will unite against them.""
dread_start.20.a:0 "Tutor sighed. Why was he so fond of speaking in riddles?"

dread_start.30.t:0 "The Dread King's Proclamation"
dread_start.30.d:0 "Hushed whispers could be heard throughout the crowd gathered in the central courtyard outside of Magehold's castle. It was exceedingly rare that the Dread King made public statements, much less ones that he deemed important enough to make himself and not have delivered through a proxy.\n\nSoon the grand doors to the castle were pulled open by a team of skeletons. Outside walked Corpus Maledictus, looking a bit more kingly than usual. He wore his crown and a regal robe, both of which he hadn't put on since his coronation eleven years prior. He trotted towards the podium with a spring in his step, as if he had found a new purpose in unlife.\n\n"Mortals and Immortals alike, it is my pleasure to welcome you all to this gathering today," began Corpus with striking zeal. The members of the Dread Council looked on in surprise, as they didn't think Corpus was capable of acting so cordial. "I have come with a proclamation. As you all know, the Library of Magehold is the source of our knowledge and power. For aeons it has held countless tomes and scrolls of ancient knowledge, but the most powerful spells were held behind the Great Seals. Over a thousand years ago, our esteemed Librarian Vetus Maledictus broke two of these Great Seals, granting us the power of Lichdom and Vampirism."\n\nAmong the Dread Council, Lady Rubra rolled her eyes in annoyance, "Some of us were there, get to the point."\n\nIf Corpus heard her, he showed no signs of it. "My subjects, the Third Great Seal is said to hold an even greater power than the first two. Not even Vetus himself could breach it. However, I have been blessed by Mordator with the knowledge needed to break it open! Soon I will usher in a new age of magic for us all!""

dread_start.1001.t:0 "The Dread King's Destiny"
dread_start.1001.d:0 "Corpus stood in front of the mysterious magical barrier known as the Third Seal. Behind him were the seven members of the Dread Council, Vetus, and a few personal guests by invitation. Throughout the rest of the Library above them were thousands of curious mages and vampires who were eager to witness the dawn of a new age of magic.\n\n"The day has come," mused Corpus as he steeled himself. This would be his finest hour, one that would be remembered by all for the rest of eternity. Though he had little love for the Ossuary, much less the late Luvenis, he desired to use the power behind this seal to follow his predecessor's mission to bring about a new world order. "...and I shall be the one to control it."\n\nCorpus stepped forward and began to utter the ancient words written in his prophecy. His words echoed throughout the Library, though only a few could understand them. All were silent, waiting with bated breath for what was to come.\n\nBut nothing happened. Corpus frowned, then repeated the words once more. Yet again, nothing happened. He pulled the prophetic letter out of his robe and double-checked the words. He said them a third time.\n\nNothing.\n\nHushed whispers among the crowd turned into fervered discussion as Corpus tried again and again to open the seal in vain. Corpus himself began to shake in disbelief. Did he say the words wrong? Was it an elaborate prank? No. It had to be real. He must have missed something. The volume of the crowd rose and rose until he could have sworn that some were yelling at him, jeering at his incompetence. Corpus' horn ignited and he amplified his voice to be heard over all: "SILENCE! I will break open the seal! None of you possess the blessing of Mordator nor the power needed to open it! If you believe yourself to have either, then come down here and I will strike you down myself!""

Of all the outcomes that could have come to pass, this was not one I had foreseen. The Gifted must have interfered somehow."\n\nAs the Heir moved with the Fodder, the Architect sensed the presence of another: The First.\n\nThough The Architect deeply respected The First, there was a noticeable amount of fear that The Architect felt as The First spoke: "Your plan has failed. The Heir has not fulfilled their destiny. The Famine is coming. You know what will happen to us when it arrives."\n\nThe Architect's gaze drifted towards the Usurper. The First noticed this, then surmised what The Architect must have been thinking. "I see. There is a certain fragility about this... Usurper... Perhaps all is not yet lost. You have one more chance. See to it that the Feast comes to pass.\n\nThe Architect did not move, instead focusing intently on the Usurper. Alterations to the plan must be made. Many alterations. The Famine must be avoided. The Feast must happen. "As you desire, my beloved, it shall be.""

dread_start.140.t:0 "Desperate Conspiracy"
dread_start.140.d:0 "Rosa sat alone in her quarters. So much had happened recently that she still struggled to wrap her head around the situation she now found herself in. She never wanted this role, but she swore to herself that she would use this opportunity to try and make her dream a reality.\n\nUnfortunately, the odds were heavily stacked against her. She was in charge of some of the most evil creatures to ever exist. Their influence was on par with hers, and many of them would certainly have her 'removed' if she were to act against them or their interests. To top it off, almost every member of the Dread Council seemed to be utterly irredeemable. If she was going to pull this off, she'd need to play her cards perfectly... and even then, that might not be enough.\n\nAn ominous chill seemed to permeate throughout her room. She took a deep breath. She had to do something. Something drastic.\n\nRosa levitated a pen and parchment to herself. She decided to write a letter to the current Headmaster of the Acturian Order. It was a plea for help, as she didn't believe that she would be able to dismantle the deeply rooted evil societies inside of the Dread League by herself. She reasoned that she needed the cooperation of someone outside of the League in order to pull this off, but... this was incredibly risky. She had to ensure that only the Headmaster got to read it, because if word got out that she was working with the League's greatest enemy...\n\nAnother chill. She shook her head. What was she thinking, trying to cooperate with the Arcturians when they had no reason to trust her? Even if she had no qualms against them, she...\n\nRosa took the letter in her shaking hooves. If her plot was uncovered, she would surely be doomed. She looked at her fireplace. It would be so easy to discard it, to try and figure something else out to stop the evil forces at work, but would she be able to do it by herself?"
dread_start.140.a:0 ""I have to try. I'll have a ghoul deliver this to the border.""

Known for his extensive narcissism, Corpus would have been just another lich if he had not possessed enough magical talent to overpower anyone who challenged him. Within his first few years of unlife, he had already proven himself to be more adept at necromancy than the vast majority of his peers. His skills attracted the attention of the Salvific Ossuary, which quickly inducted Corpus into their order.\n\nIn the centuries that followed, Corpus steadily rose through the ranks of the cult. This drew the ire of his fellow cultists, who knew that he obtained his positions not through religious zealotry, but through his natural talents. Perhaps the greatest heresy in their eyes was when Corpus became the High Priest in 941. Corpus didn't care about their religion in the slightest, but he couldn't resist the power that came with the position, for it earned him a seat on the Dread Council.\n\nSince then, he had neglected to do anything of substance for the religion he was in charge of, instead using and abusing his power to secure his position above all else. In 996, resentment within the cult's ranks had nearly reached a boiling point when their greatest wish came true: Corpus renounced his position as High Priest. He had taken a greater seat of power, one that previously belonged to the late Luvenis Maledicta, who had suffered her final death in her ill-fated conquest against the Arcturians.\n\nThus began the reign of the newest Dread King, Corpus Maledictus. A selfish lich who only takes action when it benefits him, and few are powerful enough to stand in his way.\n\n§YPortrait By:§! Neither"

Skellinore is not and never has been a warrior in her past life, and when the truth came out, her summoner was very displeased. Had any other necromancer done the deed, they would have cut the tendrils of unlife on a seemingly useless being.\n\nObit Animata, however, deemed the ritual of raising an intelligent undead too much of an investment to rid himself of Skellinore. He instead drafted the former scholar as a leader of his militia, despite Skellinore's reluctance and ineptitude.\n\nWith the threat of oblivion should she disappoint her new master, Skellinore had no choice but to take the helm as Obit Animata's militia leader. Though she had many difficulties, Skellinore has grown into her new position. In time, she has developed the logistical and experience needed to lead Obit Animata's hosts with a degree of competency that has yet to upset him.\n\nThis was not a path that Skellinore had ever considered in her previous life or this unlife. However, it is one that she can perhaps excel at despite all of the odds stacked against her. Maybe one day, she may even break free of her unlife of indentured servitude.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Egil"

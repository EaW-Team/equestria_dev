############ MAIN TREE

######## Not Faction related
DED_Council:0 "The Dread Council's Decision"
DED_Council_desc:0 "The time has come once again to choose a leader for the current Dread League. Rosa Maledicta is the most promising candidate for this position. She has great ambition that matches her proficiency in dark magic. Truly, she will be the leader the Dread League needs."

DED_Army_Dead:0 "The Army of Dread"
DED_Army_Dead_desc:0 "Every army needs leaders. We should look into gathering the best tactical minds of the Dread League, their combined experience and their leadership qualities will serve us well in the coming years. The League will see their armies fight for the respect they deserve. "

DED_Prep_Crusade:0 "Prepare for the Dark Crusade"
DED_Prep_Crusade_desc:0 "My Queen, the Arcturian Order has persecuted us for years now. You may desire to manoeuvre the Dread League into the position of waging war with those vile worshippers of the light and bring an end to the reign of their petty order."

DED_Unquiet:0 "No Rest for the Undead"
DED_Unquiet_desc:0 "The Dread League lacks the industrial capacity to support the coming Dark Crusade. This presents itself as an opportunity to put some of its inhabitants to use, as manufactures will need to be built in order to provide for the requirements of Rosa and her armies. Plans for these industrial buildings have been drawn up by the Dread Leagues' most trusted architects, they simply await approval from Rosa Maledicta."

DED_Loyalty:0 "Undying Loyalty"
DED_Loyalty_desc:0 "Rosa Maledicta herself is well versed in the dark arts of magic. To ensure the loyalty of her armies, she has cast a geas on them. This geas ensures that her armies, her generals, and some of her advisors are bound into loyalty unto her. The Dread League will be largely bound to her will."

##### Death of Light
DED_Unholy_War:0 "Mors Lucis"
DED_Unholy_War_desc:0 "For countless generations, the Dread League has been hounded and sieged by the fanatical Arcturian Order. Years of preparation has gone into preparing an army to overcome our obstacles and descend South. Declaring our intentions with the Order is the last step we need to take before our great crusade can start. To war!"

##### The end of all the lives
DED_Black_Crusade:0 "Finis Omnium Vitarum"
DED_Black_Crusade_desc:0 "The day has finally come. With the Arcturian Order lying in ashes and many of their former citizens now serving in our undead army, we can finally set our eyes on our true goal. The Crusade against all life and the installation of what Rosa Maledicta calls 'True Order'. The time has finally arrived to call forth the Dark Crusade! The world will fear the name of the Dread League!"

######## Society of Bones
DED_Soc_Bone:0 "Choose the Society of Bones"
DED_Soc_Bone_desc:0 "The Society of Bones is run by necromancers and liches. Siding with this faction will anger the Coven of Blood, but will grant us with the ability to raise large armies of skeletons and ghouls to reign terror upon the mortal nations." 

DED_Flesh_Bone:0 "Weak is the Flesh"
DED_Flesh_Bone_desc:0 "We have proposed repurposing the weak and frail within our borders to effective soldiers. The logic is sound, but our methods of doing so can be considered elegant. Those who suffered in life, serve unquestioningly in death."

DED_Work_Bone:0 "Work Them to the Bone"
DED_Work_Bone_desc:0 "Our cadavers need weapons! The Society will not sent their skeletons to fight without the proper armament of a modern army. Factories need to be built to supply our forces, to prepare for the grand crusade against life itself!"

DED_Nec_Off:0 "Order Amongst the Dead"
DED_Nec_Off_desc:0 "The Society of Bones wishes to lead their armies into war. With one of their strategically minded necromancers at the head of one of the Dread League's armies, they will be able to lead more competently than one who cannot use necromantic spells. If they had one of their own leading an army each, we will surely see an increase in overall performance."

DED_Adv_Skele:0 "Advanced Skeleton Adaptations"
DED_Adv_Skele_desc:0 "Skeletons are different to flesh and blood ponies; they have weaknesses that ponies simply lack. Establishing a institution within the Society of Bones with the sole purpose of designing solutions to these problems. It may even give those necromancers a small boost to their egos."

DED_Skele_Skin:0 "It lives Rosa! It lives!"
DED_Skele_Skin_desc:0 "Desperate times call for desperate measures, the Society of Bones have realised this with recent internal developments concerning the Society. The grand undead army is not growing fast enough to match the growing conflicts in the world. The recently deceased shall be brought forth to bolster the armies and fuel Rosa' ambitions."

DED_Skele_Armor:0 "Armoured Skeletons"
DED_Skele_Armor_desc:0 "Through the Society's efforts, most of our army is comprised of skeletons, with a smaller portion of it being zombies. Being versed in magic, some necromancers can offer their abilities to enhance specialized armour just for the skeletons. It won't be a perfect solution, but our forces will last longer on the battlefield."

DED_Skele_School:0 "Advanced Necromancy"
DED_Skele_School_desc:0 "The Society of Bones has been improving on their necromantic spells and abilities. These improvements have lead towards the skeletons having a limited innate ability to learn new things, unlike the previous method of applying spells to implant programmed tactics and actions into the skeletons."

DED_Skele_on_Skele:0 "A Marching Army"
DED_Skele_on_Skele_desc:0 "With our undead army gifted with a limited ability to learn new skills, we can finally begin to drill proper discipline into our troops. Gone are the days of large swarming hordes firing guns haphazardly and flailing swords around, the days of the coherent and intelligent undead army have come. The future bodes well for the Dread League and the Society of Bones."

DED_Skele_In_Plane:0 "Oh my, Flying Skeletons!"
DED_Skele_In_Plane_desc:0 "With the advancements of necromantic magic, skeletons are able to pilot vehicles as advanced as planes. To best take advantage of this, we will benefit from investing our resources in developing a new plane design just for the bones of our soon-to-be pilots. The skies will fall under the domain of the Dread League once more!"

DED_Spooky_Factory:0 "Exponential Necromancy"
DED_Spooky_Factory_desc:0 "The Society of Bones is getting very efficient with their spellcasting. Grand necromantic spells are being cast upon the land the Dread League has power over. As they are woven into the fabric of the land, great hordes of the ancient dead will rise. All ready to be integrated into Rosa's undead army. Necromancers will continue to weave this spell into new land if the dominion of the Dread League expands."

##### Life to Death
DED_Bone_Queen:0 "Vita ad Morte"
DED_Bone_Queen_desc:0 "The Society of Bones is impressed by you Queen Rosa, but before they devote their undivided loyalty to you they request that you prove your devotion to the cause. To do this, you must forge a phylactery and ascend to lichdom. The Society speaks of the 'Chalice of Blood' and how it is the best way to create one. My Queen, this relic has been lost for countless centuries, and must be reclaimed."

######## Vampires
DED_Guild_Blood:0 "Choose the Coven of Blood"
DED_Guild_Blood_desc:0 "The Coven of Blood is run exclusively by vampires, most of these are ponies. These vampires will specialise turning the armies of the nation into a vampyric army supported by the elite few and their thralls. Siding with this faction will anger the Society of Bones."

DED_Lord_Lady_Death:0 "The Noble Dance of Death"
DED_Lord_Lady_Death_desc:0 "A unicorn stands surrounded. Armoured Griffin knights surround her, with a grin; she becomes a blur of pony and steel. She weaves and twirls around the squad of five with both natural elegance, and surprising ferocity. When she stops, the last knight falls to the ground, dead. "That was fun, I should have started doing this sooner, but a lady does not play with her food.""

DED_Sen_Livestock:0 "Sentient Livestock"
DED_Sen_Livestock_desc:0 "Mortals have a place below us vampires, those that don't have the privilege of becoming our feeding thralls, shall be put to use in our factories. Be it so feed the vampires we have working there, or to actually work there themselves, all shall serve us."

DED_Ed_Nob:0 "Educate the Nobles"
DED_Ed_Nob_desc:0 "The nobility form the very core of our society, whilst they may sometimes think themselves above it, they too have to work hard for their nation. The members of the nobility not put forth into combat shall henceforth study technology and doctrine; our vampyric nature should allow us to make great strides, whereas the mortals would struggle."

DED_Blood_Slave:0 "Bound by Blood"
DED_Blood_Slave_desc:0 "A higher level of obedience can be achieved through blood magic. Being vampires, we of the Coven of Blood have a natural disposition towards this kind of sorcery. Through blood magic, we can ensure our thralls are loyal and carry out our plans to their utmost ability. Only the strongest of wills will be able to resist our magic."

DED_New_Blood:0 "Welcome the Fledglings"
DED_New_Blood_desc:0 "Rosa Maledicta's vision puts our current population in a poor position. We must increase our numbers reap the rewards of their inclusion to our Coven. We seek to conquer, but not all our conquests will involve thralls or blood cattle. Those we find useful will become a part of our Coven."

DED_Vamp_Club:0 "The Vampire Elite"
DED_Vamp_Club_desc:0 "Whilst the Coven is run by the Vampire Nobility, there are two echelons, the lower, and the higher. With the castes properly defined, the lower nobility will go to war, whilst the higher nobility will work towards the betterment of the dread league through scholarship. They will still learn the ways of war, but through doctrine."

DED_Fact_Farm:0 "Industrialize the League"
DED_Fact_Farm_desc:0 "Let it be said that the Coven of Blood is above the uncultured ways of the Society of Bones. We recognise that even with all of our thralls and vampires be they fledglings or purebloods, will need weapons of war to fight our future enemies. We will establish factories to aid in the growth of our war machine."

DED_Food_Ed_Nob:0 "To Teach the Masters"
DED_Food_Ed_Nob_desc:0 "Unlike the times of old where technological changes were far and few between, it was the nobility of the Coven that taught their thralls to meet their requirements. In these coming times of war, it is the thralls and servants that teach us the modern ways of the world. Specifically how modern weapons work. Rosa Maledicta's plans will benefit us greatly."

DED_Blood_Elect:0 "To Elect Thine Leader"
DED_Blood_Elect_desc:0 "Whilst the Dread League may be run by Rosa Maledicta. The Coven has a loose political structure, defined by the two echelons of Nobility. With a newly instituted law, both levels of the nobility will be required to vote for a leader of the Coven. This would be not only to represent the Coven, but to lead them on most internal matters."

DED_Blood_Soil:0 "Cursed be Thine Intruder"
DED_Blood_Soil_desc:0 "The Coven despise intruders on their lands, they view them as sacred and holy. Only their thralls, themselves, and invited guests are permitted within the Coven's borders. To solve this abhorrent problem, the Coven will weave dark blood rituals into the land. The Dread League's land will be coated in vampyric spells, all of them designed to drain the life out of foreign invading armies."

##### The immortal blood
DED_Blood_Queen:0 "Sanguis Immortalis"
DED_Blood_Queen_desc:0 "The time has come at last Rosa Maledicta. You have consolidated your power and reformed the Dread League into a nation to be rightfully feared. However, tradition dictates that you must take the mantle of 'The Scarlet Queen' to be seen as a true leader amongst the Coven. To achieve this, you need to recover the fabled Chalice of Blood which has been lost for countless centuries."

######## Ghouls

DED_Ghoul_School:0 "Send Those Ghouls to the Schools"
DED_Ghoul_School_desc:0 "Ghouls make up the majority of the residential population of Magehold and the Dread League. Despite outwards appearances, most ghouls retain the intellect they had whilst alive. But since times have changed, and with it the knowledge required to survive in it has as well. Ghoul education plans will be drafted and implemented by the council in Magehold. You can teach an old ghoul new tricks."

DED_Ghoul_Union:0 "A Ghoul's Workers' Union"
DED_Ghoul_Union_desc:0 "The ghouls of the Dread League wish to unite under a common interest and form a workers union. This would allow the ghouls of Magehold to come together on issues affecting them in the workplace and even approach other groups within the Dread League over concerns or trade agreements. Technically forming a faction themselves, they will need to appoint a representative to go before the council during meetings."

DED_Approach_Blood:0 "Ghouls Approach the Coven of Blood"
DED_Approach_Blood_desc:0 "The Worker's Union desires to approach the Coven of Blood to reach a trade agreement, as they wish to broker a deal with the cove that will benefit the ghouls that work in Coven-owned workplaces. The deal that is eventually brokered would benefit both parties as the ghouls will get access to the brain markets, and the Coven gets to enjoy a more efficient workforce in the factories they own."

DED_Approach_Bone:0 "Ghouls Approach the Society of Bones"
DED_Approach_Bone_desc:0 "For too long have the Society of Bones and their ilk have had power over the ghouls, as they are responsible for the creation of more ghouls. As a political entity, the GWU wishes to approach the Society to work out a mutually beneficial deal for both parties. The ghouls get to enjoy greater numbers, whilst the necromancers get more ghouls to work in their undead army and factories."

DED_Brain_Market:0 "The Brain Markets"
DED_Brain_Market_desc:0 "Following the agreement with the Coven, the GWU has gained access to the brain markets. The brain market is in a relatively secluded part of Magehold, to protect the grey matter from the elements due to the large variety of uses brains have. Ghouls can maintain the state of their slowly decaying brains through the consumption of this grey matter, as eating them stalls the process."

DED_Flesh_Market:0 "The Flesh Markets"
DED_Flesh_Market_desc:0 "Even though ghouls are undead beings, they still require satiating their physical needs. After their agreement with the Society, the GWU can now secure large quantities of flesh for its own ponies. Flesh isn't just sold separate like a commodity however, as corpses are also sold in this market. Following the agreement with the Society of Bones, necromancers are making ghouls out of corpses to fuel the workforce."

DED_Cool_Ghoul:0 "Cold on the Inside"
DED_Cool_Ghoul_desc:0 "Ghouls are dead ponies and griffons that most likely once lived happy lives, for some that was probably hundreds of years ago. Ghoul physiology is similar to that of which the ghoul was before he or she died, except for the fact that ghouls do not need to keep warm in the cold. To take advantage of this, we should start focusing the ghouls in our army towards more winter and mountainous combat roles."

DED_Brain_Train:0 "Putting our Brains on a Train"
DED_Brain_Train_desc:0 "Ghouls can be very ravenous people, and can consume large quantities of meat. Replacing meat with rationed cuts of brain matter will provide ghouls and zombies with a more sating food to consume on the field. This should allow more efficient management with supplies during long wars, as much the ghouls do not need to consume as much brain as they do flesh. This way the undead army has a way of staying ahead!"

DED_High_Ed:0 "The Ghoulish Institute"
DED_High_Ed_desc:0 "Our armies need training. The Council of the Dread League will implement plans to put together a training institute to further improve the potency of our soldiers. This training institute is much more efficient with their training drills, and is geared towards all forms of undead soldiers. Further plans may be drafted to introduce morale officers if army cohesion remains a problem."

DED_Work_Tool_Ghoul:0 "Factory Ghouls"
DED_Work_Tool_Ghoul_desc:0 "Not all ghouls are destined for the army or smarter jobs within the Dread Lague, some ghouls remain permanently handicapped as their brains have partially rotted. Their bodies will not go to waste however! Those who failed the ghoul education program can submit straight to the Ghoul's Workplace Initiative where every ghoul has a place in a factory, and where they work for the future of the League!"

DED_Spook_Regulate:0 "Ghoulish Regulations"
DED_Spook_Regulate_desc:0 "The Dread League is starting to feel the burden of not organising its internal structure. The Council wishes to change this and impose regulations on the League. It would curtail the consumption of food and other basic commodities, the Dread League would be more capable of developing its land with less factory space dedicated to the domestic needs of its people."

DED_Commisar_Ghoul:0 "A Very Ghoulish Commissar"
DED_Commisar_Ghoul_desc:0 "Our armies need stronger leadership in the field, so squads and regiments should be led by fearsome commissars trained by the Institute. With commissars in our armies, soldiers that work under them will surely follow orders. Commissars can lead by example, punishing those who refuse to fall in line and generally bring order to the less obedient ghouls and zombies."

######## Voodoo

DED_Voodoo_Cabal:0 "Approach the Uu't U'kra Voodoo Cabal"
DED_Voodoo_Cabal_desc:0 "We should entreat the ancient Zebrican Voodoo cabal which has survived on this peninsula for centuries. The time has come to gain the support of the Uu't U'kra tribe for the first time in the history of this continent. The Uu't U'kra zebra cannot refuse the offer we have for them. They just need to meet a few requirements to begin with."

DED_Who_Voodoo:0 "What to Do With the Voodoo"
DED_Who_Voodoo_desc:0 "The Uu't U'kra Cabal cannot simply be forced to integrate with the main body of the Dread League in just a few weeks. We must decide on how to handle the Uu't U'kra as they can finally contribute to the Dread League. Voodoo magic will support Rosa Maledicta's dream, be it directly or indirectly."

DED_We_Voodoo:0 "Voodoo for the Uu't U'kra"
DED_We_Voodoo_desc:0 "Our recent contact with the Uu't U'kra has already benefited our army with more bodies for the undead war machine. When the zebra tribe practices their dark magic, it saturates the land and makes it more receptive towards necromantic and vampryric magic. The dead army will grow evermore, like a tidal wave over washing over a shallow coast."

DED_You_Voodoo:0 "Voodoo for the Dread Council"
DED_You_Voodoo_desc:0 "The Dread Council is interested in the zebra art of voodoo, as a result; a tribal representative will join the Necromancer Council. Where they will join the Society and Coven during the important council meetings. From there onwards, the council will deliberate on how to best utilise the Uu't U'kra in the coming years. The tribal representative does not hold much sway over the council."

DED_Shrunken_Head:0 "Voodoo Trophies"
DED_Shrunken_Head_desc:0 "We at the council are interested with commanding respect over the Uu't U'kra and other internal factions within the Dread League, as we wish to gain greater influence over the Dread Peninsula. Claiming the heads of several rivals would certainly send a message to those who would dare oppose the council, and give us more power over the Dread League."

DED_Bottle_Voodoo:0 "Zebra Potion Masters"
DED_Bottle_Voodoo_desc:0 "Zebra shamans are the most talented potion makers in the world. The Uu’t U'kra shamans are no different. They have long since incorporated voodoo into the art of brewing wild concoctions that can have many effects. Putting their skills to good use in the industrial and public sectors in Magehold may alleviate the pressure on our industry to allow it to meet the demands of our undead army."

DED_Equal_Evil:0 "Equality under Malevolence"
DED_Equal_Evil_desc:0 "Be they Skeleton, Lich, Vampire or Zebra, everypony shares the same one goal, conquest of the world and the defeat of the light. Every individual in the Dread League would be labelled as vile or evil by an outsider. So let our malevolence unite us, there will be enough world out there to share after we conquer it."

DED_Sailor:0 "Sailing Stripes"
DED_Sailor_desc:0 "The Zebra are natural sailors, and the voodoo cabal is no different. Building from ancient traditions and learning from the recent innovations and doctrines stolen from other nations, the zebra will learn how to sail with a modern navy. To incorporate the Uu't U'kra as our navy, we must also construct the shipyards necessary to facilitate the existence of the Dread Armada."

DED_Sail_Salty_Sea:0 "The Dread Armada Sails the Salty Seas"
DED_Sail_Salty_Sea_desc:0 "Even with the best efforts of the council, our navy remains outdated. we must push the zebra cabal into designing a ship for the armada. Without a proper navy, our fleet is surely to be washed beneath the waves."

#### Basic Information
deadempire.1.t:0 "The Empire of the Dead"
deadempire.1.d:0 "The Dread League is little more than a collection of necromancers who live on the fringes of society. They have little industry or technology save ancient magic and outdated factories. Officially the lands of the Dread League are owned by the Arcturian Order, and have been for centuries. The knights however, know better. After the fall of the Empire of Undeath, the Dread League endures on the fringes of society. The ancient dark magic of the world will always tempt the curious, as they have now.\n\nAn evil unknown calling has brought together necromancers from across the globe to the very spot where the Empire of Undeath was defeated long ago. The frozen north. There they gather to form the necromancer's council for the time is right to choose a leader to guide them on a path to world conquest once again. The ancient dead stir. Will the mortals be ready to face the oncoming tide?"
deadempire.1.a:0 "There is much work to do..."

##### Chalice Event Chain

deadempire.3.t:0 "The Quest for the Chalice"
deadempire.3.d:0 "In order to solidify her rule as Queen of the Dead, Rosa Maledicta must embark on a quest to find an ancient unholy artefact. The chalice of blood.\n\nShe has spent many a long nights searching for clues and answers in the dark catacombs of Magehold. After all, the chalice has been lost for a millenia. While many thought it to be lost forever in the dark wasteland of the Dread League, there are always whispers and dark motions of something hidden. A greater calling must await.\n\nFervently Rosa has searched, and now she believes she has found its location. Deep in the icy mountains of the north, she believes the dark artefact lies. Legend speaks of the last great Queen of the Dead who sealed the chalice away in a great castle. However, due to the cataclysm which destroyed the empire of undeath, it was lost.\n\nNow however, Rosa has uncovered a map which points the location of the old castle. She has begun preparing an expedition into the icy mountains.\n\nThe journey will be long and tiring, but she must succeed if she is to become what she was truely meant to be!"
deadempire.3.a:0 "The Chalice will be mine!"

deadempire.4.t:0 "The Door, and the Riddle"
deadempire.4.d:0 "Rosa Maledicta and her undead thralls travelled long into the night, finally coming upon an ancient set of ruins of the old Dread Empire. The north was cold and Rosa had lost a few of her necromancers to the frozen hazardous conditions. She cursed them for being weak fools and simply rose them from death as her undead thralls.\n\n"If you cannot serve me in life. You will serve me in death, weaklings," she would snarl before continuing on her journey.\n\nAs Rosa approached the ruins, they shifted and moved, sensing her presence. After a moment the ruins seem to part to reveal a dark stone door, engraved with the face of a skull.\n\nThis had to be the place. All of the research, all of the signs. Today was the way she found the chalice and claimed her very birthright.\n\nFull of determination, she stepped closer only to realise the face was animated and moving. Upon examination with her magic, Rosa found that it was in fact a spirit which had been latched to the door to guard it. No doubt the previous Queen of the Dead's guard dog. 'There is but one surety. One purpose. One peace. One outcome. One truth. Of what do I speak?' the door whispers to the group.\n\nCould it be, Rosa's grand ascension was blocked by something as petty and stupid as an infernal riddle! With great annoyance Rosa stepped closer to the face and answered..." 
deadempire.4.a:0 "Why death... of course."
deadempire.4.b:0 "The answer is.... Taxes."
deadempire.4.c:0 "I don't have time for petty riddles!"

deadempire.5.t:0 "The Chalice"
deadempire.5.d:0 "The door chuckles in amusement. 'Very good, you understand. The only truth in this life, is death. The cycle must be broken so that we may ascend to better things than this.' With that, it parted and opened for Rosa, leaving the mare a little shocked.\n\nThe door had spoken a truth she had known for a long time. The living must be purged from the world, so that they might ascend to be the gods of creation they should be. With renewed faith that she was doing the right thing, she strode forwards and into a large domed room shrouded in darkness. The very air was thick with the smell of black magic, and in the centre of it all is the prize which she had struggled to obtain for so long.\n\nA single beam of light projected from the ceiling down to a silver cup, filled with a coppery red liquid. Rosa Maledicta walked forward triumphantly and took the silver challice in her hooves. She could feel the arcane energy radiating from the object, throbbing with pure power in magic. Oh yes, this was it. The fabled chalice of blood was hers for the taking!\n\nThere was little time to waste. Rosa put all thoughts of caution out of her head and smiled, 'Yes. This is my moment. Chalice, I claim your power. It is mine by right, now give me the power to become the almighty Queen of Death', she belowed, shortly before tipping the chalice and drinking its contents dry."
deadempire.5.a:0 "Yes! More power! More!"

deadempire.12.t:0 "To Rest Upon a Sea of Bones"
deadempire.12.d:0 "Upon drinking from the Chalice, Rosa Maledicta began casting an ancient necromantic incantation, the walls hummed with power as both the Chalice and Rosa's magic. Abruptly, it all stopped, with her spell, it altered the energy to be more receptive to necromantic energies. Rosa recollected her thoughts, returning to the focal point of all necromantic energies in the Dread League is but only the next step. Venturing from the ruins, she trekked for many cold days and nights back to Magehold. It glowed with energy in Rosa's eyes, the magic of the Chalice within her revealing all the focal points of magic to her. The home of the Society of Bones shone brightest.\n\nHer return to the home of the Society did not take her long, and upon reaching it, the door immediately responded to her. It was as if the door recognised the magic of the Chalice within her. The giant room thrummed with necromantic energy, almost catalysing with the power within her. She knew that the ritual had to be undertaken soon.\n\nUpon gathering the resources for the ritual, Rosa started to carve runes into the ground around the heart of death itself, each one flaring to life with a foul cyan glow. "Ad morti, eo!" Rosa chanted, each time she spoke the verse, the room pulsed with power. After ten minutes of chanting, she fell silent, allowing the runes to pulse one last time. "It is ready"\n\nRosa Maledicta strode towards the centre of the room, her horn glowing in the malevolent energy of the room. With one last look around her, she released her spell and initiated the ritual. Like a crack of thunder, the runes exploded with energy. Surging straight towards her and deep into her soul, the magic tore at Rosa Maledicta with untold force. When the magic ceased, she fell like a ragdoll to the floor, dead. The large chamber fell quiet; the necromantic energies having been sapped from their source.\n\nSilence reigned following the ritual. Smalls movements broke this silence when the 'body' of Rosa Maledicta rose, her body changed. With glossy eyes, and layers of flesh missing in many areas of her body, Rosa was truly a lich. For she need not to draw breath again."
deadempire.12.a:0 "I feel... such power! Truly, I have transcended the mortal coil!"

#### Blood queen
deadempire.2.t:0 "Oceans of Blood Lie Before You"
deadempire.2.d:0 "The Liquid from the Chalice took effect on Rosa Maledicta almost instantly, a head splitting headache hitting her almost immediately. Almost floored by the sudden assault of pain, she stood still and weathered the storm. The feeling of energy rushing through her was the most energetic she had ever felt, but no, she mustn’t be distracted by petty feelings. Her time to admire herself will come after she has ascended to mortal coil. She would need to venture back home, towards Magehold.\n\nHer journey was long, her thralls tired, but it paid off when she saw Magehold in the distance. The approach to the Dread Council building was met with the adoration of the many vampires that now populated Magehold. Entering the building and passing through the corridor to the Coven, Rosa Maledicta had already begun planning the ritual to undertake in the home of the Coven.\n\nWhen the veil of magic had lifted from her sight, the home of the Coven was once again around her. "The energy of the Chalice runs deep within me, we must get to work while it lasts." Rosa Maledicta commanded to the thralls and the vampires present there, eager to embrace her future. Rosa was escorted to a room where the leader of the Coven awaited her, said vampire had a warm smile on her face. "I have been expecting you, which means it is time for me to pass on the mantle to you." the mare whispered into Rosa's ear.\n\nRosa watched as the vampire cut just above her forehoof and drained some of the blood into a bowl. "Drink this, the last thing you need. The Blood of another vampire" and with that, she move away from Rosa Maledicta and towards a circular seat carved into the floor, and gestured to the large circular pedastal. "Drink my blood there, only then will this ritual work" The Coven mare supplied.\n\nThis was it, Rosa Maledicta would finally attain the title of Blood Queen, ascend beyond the mortal coil. As Rosa drank from the bowl, the Coven mare incanted "Meum Sanguinem, pro Alium" and the room flared to life, blood and energy flowing into Rosa from an unknown source in the room.\n\nThe only feeling Rosa could feel was that of pure ecstasy, her body felt younger and younger by each passing second. The following moments saw the vampyric magic die down, revealing that the other Coven mare was lying there dying. She took one look at Rosa Maledicta and smiled, “You look so young and beatufil my queen, my death is worth it just to gaze upon you.” Those were her last words before her eyes closed for the last time, her body truly motionless.  Conjuring a mirror, Rosa Maledicta observed her features with a pleased smile. The world will tremble before her, as she felt more alive than ever before."
deadempire.2.a:0 "I have never felt so young in my life!\nThis power is overwhelming!"

deadempire.6.t:0 "The Society Withdraws from the Council"
deadempire.6.d:0 "The Society of Bones has expressed their disappointment in Rosa Maledicta. They removed themselves from the council and any necromancer affiliated with the Society of Bones fled Magehold.\n\nWith the Society gone, massive hordes of zombies and skeletons cannot be raised to fight against the living. Necromancers remain in Magehold, but the majority of powerful necromancers have abandoned the cause to fight for the ascension of the Dread League. They perceive it as Rosa Maledicta not having their best interests in mind.\n\nWith the exodus of the Society of Bones, you will see a severe reduction in the growth of your army as the denizens that feed off of necromantic energies begin to fade or die out. Don't let the vampires bite at night."
deadempire.6.a:0 "A disappointment indeed, they will not be missed."

#Blood Repercussions
deadempire.7.t:0 "The Coven Withdraws from the Council"
deadempire.7.d:0 "With a darkening of the room, followed by a loud hiss and a rush of air, the Coven representatives left the council chambers. It is a shame to see them go, but choosing the Society of Bones over them was something they couldn't stand with.\n\nThe departure of the Coven means that most vampryic denizens of the Magehold will have fled. The biggest drawback however, is the loss of the Coven themselves. You cannot field an army of vampires to do your bidding. You must rely on the necromantic spells and magic of the Society from this point forward.\n\nLet us hope that the Coven do not plan on revenge, some older vampires can keep a grudge that lasts for hundreds of years. We must pray that they are more understanding over this choice."
deadempire.7.a:0 "Such pathetic creatures."

deadempire.8.d:0 "In the dark and cold north, a great sickness plagues the land. Like a rampant tumour, a peninsula hangs off the face of Griffonia, tainting it's otherwise pure image. The Dread League resides upon it, further tainting the continent.\n\nReports from the border have revealed that this tumour wishes to spread it's foul influence across the world, casting darkness upon every inch of land, every city, every living thing. Nothing stands to survive if this sickness spreads, we must prepare to end it before it comes to that.\n\nThe Dead Army will march, it is only a matter of time. We must use this calm before the inevitable undead storm, to prepare for the war with the Undead."
deadempire.8.a:0 "We must isolate this sickness!"

#Dread Council Information
deadempire.9.t:0 "The Dread Council"
deadempire.9.d:0 "Welcome my queen! The Dread Council is the place where all the major factions come together and deliberate over the future, or attempt to settle disputes in a more civil manner.  The only two factions you should know about are the Society of Bones and the Coven of Blood. Sadly, when the Coven and Society enter the same room, egos clash.\n\nThe Society of Bones is largely a collection of necromancers, with a small group of ancient liches commanding the most respect and power amongst them. The Society has had a long history of mass resurrection spells, and have such grown accustomed to amassing large armies of skeletons and sometimes zombies to do their bidding. Since the condition of the cadaver can never be properly determined, the Society relies on horde and swarm tactics in times of war in hopes to simply overwhelm the opponent.\n\nOn the other side we have the vampires of the Coven of Blood, the oldest surviving faction on this peninsula. They often consider themselves the superior beings and can be quite arrogant; this mindset does not help them when a council meeting is due. Many of disputes between the Coven and the Society often come from council meetings.\n\nThe Coven of Blood has a superior army compared to the Society, being comprised mainly of thralls and vampires themselves. However since it is very difficult to produce another living vampire and the thralls that they take for themselves, the Coven cannot field a large army as swiftly as the Society does. They may hit hard and fast, but losing one of their own can set the Coven back months.\n\nYou have a difficult choice ahead of you my queen, we hope you choose the one which is best suited for you. You won't be able to turn your back on the one that you decide to associate yourself with, so decide carefully."
deadempire.9.a:0 "I will deliberate over this information."

#Blood Support

deadempire.10.d:0 "The Leader of the Coven looked directly at you, her mouth curling into a fanged smile.\n\n"We are delighted you made the right choice, come, follow me. I'll show you our ways, my queen" The leader spoke, motioning for you to follow her through the door behind her. Beyond the doors lied a long corridor, lined with mosaics of notable figures from the ancient Dread Empire. The history behind those having long been lost to the annals of time, the finer details having faded on the old paint.\n\nAt the end of the Corridor sat a pedestal, on it read the words 'The way lies open to those of the sanguine calling'. The Coven leader looks towards you expectantly and urges you to place a hoof on the pedestal. "Good, now I shall do the rest" she uttered, placing her hoof over yours.\n\n "Sanguis ad Sanguine, Omnis erit Conspicuum" she spoke, immediately the room began to darken. Pain struck your hoof and you felt a slight trickle of warm blood, and like it had life of it's own, began to cover the etchings of the pedestal. The room adopted a sanguine glow and started to emit a hum, one that drilled straight into your head. It left as quickly as it came, the room no longer as dark as it had been.\n\n"Welcome to the Coven of blood, my Queen Rosa. I have much to show you about us." With those words, she placed her hoof on the pedestal herself, and were both sent to another location in a veil of crimson magic.\n\nThe veil lifts to show you a large room, filled with other vampires and some thralls. "Welcome home, Queen Rosa" she utters, gesturing widely to the room and it's occupants."
deadempire.10.a:0 "Indeed, there is work to be done."

deadempire.11.t:0 "The Decrepit Path of Death"
deadempire.11.d:0 ""Most fortuitous!" The haggard leader of the Society exclaimed, he was a tall lich whose flesh was almost non-existent. Clearly he was an old lich, but spoke in a modern dialect, evidently not as old as you initially thought him to be. "My Queen, we must escort you to the Focal Chamber. It is the centre of all necromantic energies in Magehold." he said whilst walking towards the entrance of the Dread Council building.\n\nHe lead you down a long and winding path to the lowest point of the undead city, the lower you got, the more it stank of death and decay. Bodies started to pile up and flies started to become a common occurrence, as the decay of warm bodies ready for resurrection has done away with the cold normally experienced by such a northern location.\n\n"Not much further my queen, you either get used to the smell, or you lose it" the lich informed apologetically, approaching the precipice of two large doors. They were decorated in large bones and a skull which belonged to a dragon, marked with scars long worn by the humid environment.\n\nThe Lich murmured something undecipherable towards the door, the eyes of the dragon glow and the doors open. They reveal a large interior with a deep chamber, the dead centre of the structure hummed with necromantic energies that made the hairs of living beings stand on end. A long spiral staircase descended towards the bottom of the massive chamber, decorated in shiny ebony metal.\n\n"Here it is Queen Rosa Maledicta, the heart of the Society of Bones. We hope it serves you just as it has served us." the lich said, walking inside before you."

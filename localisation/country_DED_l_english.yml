############ MAIN TREE

######## Not Faction related
DED_Council:0 "The Dread Council's Decision"
DED_Council_desc:0 "The time has come once again to choose a leader for the current Dread League. Rosa Maledicta is the most promising candidate for this position. She has great ambition that matches her proficiency in dark magic. Truly, she will be the leader the Dread League needs."

DED_Army_Dead:0 "The Army of Dread"
DED_Army_Dead_desc:0 "Every army needs leaders. We should look into gathering the best tactical minds of the Dread League, their combined experience and their leadership qualities will serve us well in the coming years. The League will see their armies fight for the respect they deserve. "

DED_Prep_Crusade:0 "Prepare for the Dark Crusade"
DED_Prep_Crusade_desc:0 "My Queen, the Arcturian Order has persecuted us for years now. You may desire to manoeuvre the Dread League into the position of waging war with those vile worshippers of the light and bring an end to the reign of their petty order."

DED_Unquiet:0 "No Rest for the Undead"
DED_Unquiet_desc:0 "The Dread League lacks the industrial capacity to support the coming Dark Crusade. This presents itself as an opportunity to put some of its inhabitants to use, as manufactures will need to be built in order to provide for the requirements of Rosa and her armies. Plans for these industrial buildings have been drawn up by the Dread Leagues' most trusted architects, they simply await approval from Rosa Maledicta."

DED_Loyalty:0 "Undying Loyalty"
DED_Loyalty_desc:0 "Rosa Maledicta herself is well versed in the dark arts of magic. To ensure the loyalty of her armies, she has cast a geas on them. This geas ensures that her armies, her generals, and some of her advisors are bound into loyalty unto her. The Dread League will be largely bound to her will."

##### Death of Light
DED_Unholy_War:0 "Mors Lucis"
DED_Unholy_War_desc:0 "For countless generations, the Dread League has been hounded and besieged by the fanatical Arcturian Order. Years of preparation has gone into preparing an army to overcome our obstacles and descend South. Declaring our intentions with the Order is the last step we need to take before our great crusade can start. To war!"

##### The end of all the lives
DED_Black_Crusade:0 "Finis Omnium Vitarum"
DED_Black_Crusade_desc:0 "The day has finally come. With the Arcturian Order lying in ashes and many of their former citizens now serving in our undead army, we can finally set our eyes on our true goal. The Crusade against all life and the installation of what Rosa Maledicta calls 'True Order'. The time has finally arrived to call forth the Dark Crusade! The world will fear the name of the Dread League!"

######## Society of Bones
DED_Soc_Bone:0 "Choose the Society of Bones"
DED_Soc_Bone_desc:0 "The Society of Bones is run by necromancers and liches. Siding with this faction will anger the Coven of Blood, but will grant us with the ability to raise large armies of skeletons and ghouls to reign terror upon the mortal nations."

DED_Flesh_Bone:0 "Weak is the Flesh"
DED_Flesh_Bone_desc:0 "We have proposed repurposing the weak and frail within our borders to effective soldiers. The logic is sound, but our methods of doing so can be considered elegant. Those who suffered in life, serve unquestioningly in death."

DED_Work_Bone:0 "Work Them to the Bone"
DED_Work_Bone_desc:0 "Our cadavers need weapons! The Society will not sent their skeletons to fight without the proper armament of a modern army. Factories need to be built to supply our forces, to prepare for the grand crusade against life itself!"

DED_Nec_Off:0 "Order Amongst the Dead"
DED_Nec_Off_desc:0 "The Society of Bones wishes to lead their armies into war. With one of their strategically minded necromancers at the head of one of the Dread League's armies, they will be able to lead more competently than one who cannot use necromantic spells. If they had one of their own leading an army each, we will surely see an increase in overall performance."

DED_Adv_Skele:0 "Advanced Skeleton Adaptations"
DED_Adv_Skele_desc:0 "Skeletons are different to flesh and blood ponies; they have weaknesses that ponies simply lack. Establishing a institution within the Society of Bones with the sole purpose of designing solutions to these problems. It may even give those necromancers a small boost to their egos."

DED_Skele_Skin:0 "It lives Rosa! It lives!"
DED_Skele_Skin_desc:0 "Desperate times call for desperate measures, the Society of Bones have realised this with recent internal developments concerning the Society. The grand undead army is not growing fast enough to match the growing conflicts in the world. The recently deceased shall be brought forth to bolster the armies and fuel Rosa' ambitions."

DED_Skele_Armor:0 "Armoured Skeletons"
DED_Skele_Armor_desc:0 "Through the Society's efforts, most of our army is comprised of skeletons, with a smaller portion of it being zombies. Being versed in magic, some necromancers can offer their abilities to enhance specialised armour just for the skeletons. It won't be a perfect solution, but our forces will last longer on the battlefield."

DED_Skele_School:0 "Advanced Necromancy"
DED_Skele_School_desc:0 "The Society of Bones has been improving on their necromantic spells and abilities. These improvements have lead towards the skeletons having a limited innate ability to learn new things, unlike the previous method of applying spells to implant programmed tactics and actions into the skeletons."

DED_Skele_on_Skele:0 "A Marching Army"
DED_Skele_on_Skele_desc:0 "With our undead army gifted with a limited ability to learn new skills, we can finally begin to drill proper discipline into our troops. Gone are the days of large swarming hordes firing guns haphazardly and flailing swords around, the days of the coherent and intelligent undead army have come. The future bodes well for the Dread League and the Society of Bones."

DED_Skele_In_Plane:0 "Oh my, Flying Skeletons!"
DED_Skele_In_Plane_desc:0 "With the advancements of necromantic magic, skeletons are able to pilot vehicles as advanced as planes. To best take advantage of this, we will benefit from investing our resources in developing a new plane design just for the bones of our soon-to-be pilots. The skies will fall under the domain of the Dread League once more!"

DED_Spooky_Factory:0 "Exponential Necromancy"
DED_Spooky_Factory_desc:0 "The Society of Bones is getting very efficient with their spellcasting. Grand necromantic spells are being cast upon the land the Dread League has power over. As they are woven into the fabric of the land, great hordes of the ancient dead will rise. All ready to be integrated into Rosa's undead army. Necromancers will continue to weave this spell into new land if the dominion of the Dread League expands."

##### Life to Death
DED_Bone_Queen:0 "Vita ad Morte"
DED_Bone_Queen_desc:0 "The Society of Bones is impressed by you Queen Rosa, but before they devote their undivided loyalty to you they request that you prove your devotion to the cause. To do this, you must forge a phylactery and ascend to lichdom. The Society speaks of the 'Chalice of Blood' and how it is the best way to create one. My Queen, this relic has been lost for countless centuries, and must be reclaimed."

######## Vampires
DED_Guild_Blood:0 "Choose the Coven of Blood"
DED_Guild_Blood_desc:0 "The Coven of Blood is run exclusively by vampires, most of these are ponies. These vampires will specialise turning the armies of the nation into a vampyric army supported by the elite few and their thralls. Siding with this faction will anger the Society of Bones."

DED_Lord_Lady_Death:0 "The Noble Dance of Death"
DED_Lord_Lady_Death_desc:0 "A unicorn stands surrounded. Armoured Griffin knights surround her, with a grin; she becomes a blur of pony and steel. She weaves and twirls around the squad of five with both natural elegance, and surprising ferocity. When she stops, the last knight falls to the ground, dead. "That was fun, I should have started doing this sooner, but a lady does not play with her food.""

DED_Sen_Livestock:0 "Sentient Livestock"
DED_Sen_Livestock_desc:0 "Mortals have a place below us vampires, those that don't have the privilege of becoming our feeding thralls, shall be put to use in our factories. Be it so feed the vampires we have working there, or to actually work there themselves, all shall serve us."

DED_Ed_Nob:0 "Educate the Nobles"
DED_Ed_Nob_desc:0 "The nobility form the very core of our society, whilst they may sometimes think themselves above it, they too have to work hard for their nation. The members of the nobility not put forth into combat shall henceforth study technology and doctrine; our vampyric nature should allow us to make great strides, whereas the mortals would struggle."

DED_Blood_Slave:0 "Bound by Blood"
DED_Blood_Slave_desc:0 "A higher level of obedience can be achieved through blood magic. Being vampires, we of the Coven of Blood have a natural disposition towards this kind of sorcery. Through blood magic, we can ensure our thralls are loyal and carry out our plans to their utmost ability. Only the strongest of wills will be able to resist our magic."

DED_New_Blood:0 "Welcome the Fledglings"
DED_New_Blood_desc:0 "Rosa Maledicta's vision puts our current population in a poor position. We must increase our numbers reap the rewards of their inclusion to our Coven. We seek to conquer, but not all our conquests will involve thralls or blood cattle. Those we find useful will become a part of our Coven."

DED_Vamp_Club:0 "The Vampire Elite"
DED_Vamp_Club_desc:0 "Whilst the Coven is run by the Vampire Nobility, there are two echelons, the lower, and the higher. With the castes properly defined, the lower nobility will go to war, whilst the higher nobility will work towards the betterment of the dread league through scholarship. They will still learn the ways of war, but through doctrine."

DED_Fact_Farm:0 "Industrialise the League"
DED_Fact_Farm_desc:0 "Let it be said that the Coven of Blood is above the uncultured ways of the Society of Bones. We recognise that even with all of our thralls and vampires be they fledglings or purebloods, will need weapons of war to fight our future enemies. We will establish factories to aid in the growth of our war machine."

DED_Food_Ed_Nob:0 "To Teach the Masters"
DED_Food_Ed_Nob_desc:0 "Unlike the times of old where technological changes were far and few between, it was the nobility of the Coven that taught their thralls to meet their requirements. In these coming times of war, it is the thralls and servants that teach us the modern ways of the world. Specifically how modern weapons work. Rosa Maledicta's plans will benefit us greatly."

DED_Blood_Elect:0 "To Elect Thine Leader"
DED_Blood_Elect_desc:0 "Whilst the Dread League may be run by Rosa Maledicta. The Coven has a loose political structure, defined by the two echelons of Nobility. With a newly instituted law, both levels of the nobility will be required to vote for a leader of the Coven. This would be not only to represent the Coven, but to lead them on most internal matters."

DED_Blood_Soil:0 "Cursed be Thine Intruder"
DED_Blood_Soil_desc:0 "The Coven despise intruders on their lands, they view them as sacred and holy. Only their thralls, themselves, and invited guests are permitted within the Coven's borders. To solve this abhorrent problem, the Coven will weave dark blood rituals into the land. The Dread League's land will be coated in vampyric spells, all of them designed to drain the life out of foreign invading armies."

##### The immortal blood
DED_Blood_Queen:0 "Sanguis Immortalis"
DED_Blood_Queen_desc:0 "The time has come at last Rosa Maledicta. You have consolidated your power and reformed the Dread League into a nation to be rightfully feared. However, tradition dictates that you must take the mantle of 'The Scarlet Queen' to be seen as a true leader amongst the Coven. To achieve this, you need to recover the fabled Chalice of Blood which has been lost for countless centuries."

######## Ghouls

DED_Ghoul_School:0 "Send Those Ghouls to the Schools"
DED_Ghoul_School_desc:0 "Ghouls make up the majority of the residential population of Magehold and the Dread League. Despite outwards appearances, most ghouls retain the intellect they had whilst alive. But since times have changed, and with it the knowledge required to survive in it has as well. Ghoul education plans will be drafted and implemented by the council in Magehold. You can teach an old ghoul new tricks."

DED_Ghoul_Union:0 "A Ghoul's Workers' Union"
DED_Ghoul_Union_desc:0 "The ghouls of the Dread League wish to unite under a common interest and form a workers union. This would allow the ghouls of Magehold to come together on issues affecting them in the workplace and even approach other groups within the Dread League over concerns or trade agreements. Technically forming a faction themselves, they will need to appoint a representative to go before the council during meetings."

DED_Approach_Blood:0 "Ghouls Approach the Coven of Blood"
DED_Approach_Blood_desc:0 "The Worker's Union desires to approach the Coven of Blood to reach a trade agreement, as they wish to broker a deal with the cove that will benefit the ghouls that work in Coven-owned workplaces. The deal that is eventually brokered would benefit both parties as the ghouls will get access to the brain markets, and the Coven gets to enjoy a more efficient workforce in the factories they own."

DED_Approach_Bone:0 "Ghouls Approach the Society of Bones"
DED_Approach_Bone_desc:0 "For too long have the Society of Bones and their ilk have had power over the ghouls, as they are responsible for the creation of more ghouls. As a political entity, the GWU wishes to approach the Society to work out a mutually beneficial deal for both parties. The ghouls get to enjoy greater numbers, whilst the necromancers get more ghouls to work in their undead army and factories."

DED_Brain_Market:0 "The Brain Markets"
DED_Brain_Market_desc:0 "Following the agreement with the Coven, the GWU has gained access to the brain markets. The brain market is in a relatively secluded part of Magehold, to protect the grey matter from the elements due to the large variety of uses brains have. Ghouls can maintain the state of their slowly decaying brains through the consumption of this grey matter, as eating them stalls the process."

DED_Flesh_Market:0 "The Flesh Markets"
DED_Flesh_Market_desc:0 "Even though ghouls are undead beings, they still require satiating their physical needs. After their agreement with the Society, the GWU can now secure large quantities of flesh for its own ponies. Flesh isn't just sold separate like a commodity however, as corpses are also sold in this market. Following the agreement with the Society of Bones, necromancers are making ghouls out of corpses to fuel the workforce."

DED_Cool_Ghoul:0 "Cold on the Inside"
DED_Cool_Ghoul_desc:0 "Ghouls are dead ponies and griffons that most likely once lived happy lives, for some that was probably hundreds of years ago. Ghoul physiology is similar to that of which the ghoul was before he or she died, except for the fact that ghouls do not need to keep warm in the cold. To take advantage of this, we should start focusing the ghouls in our army towards more winter and mountainous combat roles."

DED_Brain_Train:0 "Putting our Brains on a Train"
DED_Brain_Train_desc:0 "Ghouls can be very ravenous people, and can consume large quantities of meat. Replacing meat with rationed cuts of brain matter will provide ghouls and zombies with a more sating food to consume on the field. This should allow more efficient management with supplies during long wars, as much the ghouls do not need to consume as much brain as they do flesh. This way the undead army has a way of staying ahead!"

DED_High_Ed:0 "The Ghoulish Institute"
DED_High_Ed_desc:0 "Our armies need training. The Council of the Dread League will implement plans to put together a training institute to further improve the potency of our soldiers. This training institute is much more efficient with their training drills, and is geared towards all forms of undead soldiers. Further plans may be drafted to introduce morale officers if army cohesion remains a problem."

DED_Work_Tool_Ghoul:0 "Factory Ghouls"
DED_Work_Tool_Ghoul_desc:0 "Not all ghouls are destined for the army or smarter jobs within the Dread League, some ghouls remain permanently handicapped as their brains have partially rotted. Their bodies will not go to waste however! Those who failed the ghoul education program can submit straight to the Ghoul's Workplace Initiative where every ghoul has a place in a factory, and where they work for the future of the League!"

DED_Spook_Regulate:0 "Ghoulish Regulations"
DED_Spook_Regulate_desc:0 "The Dread League is starting to feel the burden of not organising its internal structure. The Council wishes to change this and impose regulations on the League. It would curtail the consumption of food and other basic commodities, the Dread League would be more capable of developing its land with less factory space dedicated to the domestic needs of its people."

DED_Commisar_Ghoul:0 "A Very Ghoulish Commissar"
DED_Commisar_Ghoul_desc:0 "Our armies need stronger leadership in the field, so squads and regiments should be led by fearsome commissars trained by the Institute. With commissars in our armies, soldiers that work under them will surely follow orders. Commissars can lead by example, punishing those who refuse to fall in line and generally bring order to the less obedient ghouls and zombies."

######## Voodoo

DED_Voodoo_Cabal:0 "Approach the Uu't U'kra Voodoo Cabal"
DED_Voodoo_Cabal_desc:0 "We should entreat the ancient Zebrican Voodoo cabal which has survived on this peninsula for centuries. The time has come to gain the support of the Uu't U'kra tribe for the first time in the history of this continent. The Uu't U'kra zebra cannot refuse the offer we have for them. They just need to meet a few requirements to begin with."

DED_Who_Voodoo:0 "What to Do With the Voodoo"
DED_Who_Voodoo_desc:0 "The Uu't U'kra Cabal cannot simply be forced to integrate with the main body of the Dread League in just a few weeks. We must decide on how to handle the Uu't U'kra as they can finally contribute to the Dread League. Voodoo magic will support Rosa Maledicta's dream, be it directly or indirectly."

DED_We_Voodoo:0 "Voodoo for the Uu't U'kra"
DED_We_Voodoo_desc:0 "Our recent contact with the Uu't U'kra has already benefited our army with more bodies for the undead war machine. When the zebra tribe practices their dark magic, it saturates the land and makes it more receptive towards necromantic and vampryric magic. The dead army will grow evermore, like a tidal wave over washing over a shallow coast."

DED_You_Voodoo:0 "Voodoo for the Dread Council"
DED_You_Voodoo_desc:0 "The Dread Council is interested in the zebra art of voodoo, as a result; a tribal representative will join the Necromancer Council. Where they will join the Society and Coven during the important council meetings. From there onwards, the council will deliberate on how to best utilise the Uu't U'kra in the coming years. The tribal representative does not hold much sway over the council."

DED_Shrunken_Head:0 "Voodoo Trophies"
DED_Shrunken_Head_desc:0 "We at the council are interested with commanding respect over the Uu't U'kra and other internal factions within the Dread League, as we wish to gain greater influence over the Dread Peninsula. Claiming the heads of several rivals would certainly send a message to those who would dare oppose the council, and give us more power over the Dread League."

DED_Bottle_Voodoo:0 "Zebra Potion Masters"
DED_Bottle_Voodoo_desc:0 "Zebra shamans are the most talented potion makers in the world. The Uu’t U'kra shamans are no different. They have long since incorporated voodoo into the art of brewing wild concoctions that can have many effects. Putting their skills to good use in the industrial and public sectors in Magehold may alleviate the pressure on our industry to allow it to meet the demands of our undead army."

DED_Equal_Evil:0 "Equality under Malevolence"
DED_Equal_Evil_desc:0 "Be they Skeleton, Lich, Vampire or Zebra, everypony shares the same one goal, conquest of the world and the defeat of the light. Every individual in the Dread League would be labelled as vile or evil by an outsider. So let our malevolence unite us, there will be enough world out there to share after we conquer it."

DED_Sailor:0 "Sailing Stripes"
DED_Sailor_desc:0 "The Zebra are natural sailors, and the voodoo cabal is no different. Building from ancient traditions and learning from the recent innovations and doctrines stolen from other nations, the zebra will learn how to sail with a modern navy. To incorporate the Uu't U'kra as our navy, we must also construct the shipyards necessary to facilitate the existence of the Dread Armada."

DED_Sail_Salty_Sea:0 "The Dread Armada Sails the Salty Seas"
DED_Sail_Salty_Sea_desc:0 "Even with the best efforts of the council, our navy remains outdated. we must push the zebra cabal into designing a ship for the armada. Without a proper navy, our fleet is surely to be washed beneath the waves."
DED_Sail_Salty_Sea_tt:0 "Spawns §Y4 Destroyers§!"

######## - War Plans
DED_War_Plan_Bone:0 "The All-Consuming Horde"
DED_War_Plan_Bone_desc:0 "Rank upon rank, horde upon horde. We do not need the technology that others rely on. We will tear down the world order with blood and bone and an endless press of bodies. Their own dead shall rise against them. They have no hope."

DED_War_Plan_Blood:0 "The Ravening Hunger"
DED_War_Plan_Blood_desc:0 "The coteries and cabals are all in agreement. We will take our war to the world and enforce our will upon it. None shall be able to resist. All shall fall, fail, and fade, forgotten forever."

######## The Black Crusade
DED_Construction:0 "Graveyard Shift"
DED_Construction_desc:0 "As lands topple around us and kingdoms fall to our overwhelming might, we must take steps to ensure that we are properly utilising what we have gained. Our guiding philosophy is 'waste not, want not', so why shouldn't this apply to our means of production as well?"

DED_Construction2:0 "Working Stiffs"
DED_Construction2_desc:0 "The first round of land improvements went well. But we can do better. Instead of relying on the normal channels, we will assign special task forces of 'conscripted' forces to work round the clock and complete the next phase in our grand vision."

DED_Construction3:0 "Souls into Cinders"
DED_Construction3_desc:0 "Ah, the sound of progress! Pounding pistons, clanging hammers, and the screams of the damned. One of our members has suggested the use of specialised fuel for our new factories. Soulgems, which, when exposed to the right necromantic magic, will provide more power than anything we've previously discovered. We will erect a few more factories with this innovation installed in order to test his theory."

DED_Mil_Construction:0 "Guns for Ghouls"
DED_Mil_Construction_desc:0 "What good is an army if we can't equip it? The days of endless hordes shambling across the fields and rending flesh from bone with bare claws and hooves are over. Our enemies have guns and artillery. We must adapt and change, adopting the advances while leaving aside the backwards views of our neighbours. But only with a properly equipped army will we be able to take them on."

DED_Mil_Construction2:0 "Grim Reaper's Industry"
DED_Mil_Construction2_desc:0 "We must increase our ability to wage war. Yes, we need more troops, but we still must make sure they are equipped. After all, a gun without bullets to shoot is simply an over-designed and not very effective club."

DED_Mil_Construction3:0 "Arsenal of Hades"
DED_Mil_Construction3_desc:0 "The final stage of our industrial upgrade is ready to put into implementation, my lady. With a strong, industrialised backing, our armies will be unstoppable. We will march over the ruined cities of our enemies. The world will bow before your might."

DED_More_Bodies:0 "Forced Recruitment"
DED_More_Bodies_desc:0 "In order to pursue this war, we must have more troops for the frontline. Our current recruitment policy is not enough. We must promote those willing and able to bring about appropriate measures for the expansion of our reinforcement pool."
DED_bc_pop_growth:0 "Forced Recruitment"

DED_Dark_Power:0 "Powered by the Apocalypse"
DED_Dark_Power_desc:0 "Our armies rise. Every enemy soldier that falls is one more to add to our collection. We march forward, a hurricane of undead might. Nothing will stand in our way now. We have become invincible."
DED_bc_inf_attack:0 "Powered by the Apocalypse"

DED_Modern_Technology:0 "Society of Technological Superiority"
DED_Modern_Technology_desc:0 "The unfortunate reality of our situation is that we are woefully, laughably behind our neighbours in the realm of technology. Our necromantic might is without equal, but the tanks and planes of our enemies could quickly turn the tide against us. We must take steps to remedy this situation."
DED_Modern_Technology_Idea:0 "Society of Technological Superiority"

DED_Burst_The_Shell:0 "Burst the Shell"
DED_Burst_The_Shell_desc:0 "A crude metaphor, perhaps, for what we are truly doing, but one that I think communicates the idea quite nicely. Well, at least it does to me. And it will confuse and confound our enemies, so there is no great loss there."
DED_Burst_The_Shell_tech:0 "Burst the Shell"
DED_Burst_The_Shell_effect:0 "Enables §HBurst the Shell§!\nAll Infantry & Mot/Mech:\n    Hard attack: §G+50%§!\n    Piercing: §G+200%§!\n"

### Leaders ################################
############################################

POLITICS_ROSAINITIAL_DESC:0 "Rosa Maledicta is one of many necromancers who are struggling for control over the fractured nation which is the Dread League. Rosa has recently risen as the de-facto leader of the necromancer council, but in the fickle lands of darkness that may well quickly change. Rosa rules with an iron fist, crushing all opposition with ruthless aggression and tyranny. Once a unicorn living in the peaceful lands of Equestria, she has been called to the land of the dead by promises of power and justice. She was never happy in Equestria. Ponies rejected her dark talents and she has been betrayed by her old pony friends more times than she can count. Never again. If the world will not love her, the world will learn to fear the name of Rosa Maledicta."
POLITICS_ROSALICH_DESC:0 "This monster is a far cry from the unicorn of old. Rosa Maledicta has enacted a dark ritual and turned herself into a ferocious lich. With her phylactery well hidden, she is now pulsing with dark power. Her seeming invincibility makes her cocky and aggressive. If she was ruthless before, now she has redefined the meaning of the word. Rosa seems angrier than before, quick to take life and raise it again in her service. Any remark about her monstrous appearance is quickly rewarded with death and she strides with a wicked confidence. No longer does she need to harsh punishments and harsher threats to keep her fellow necromancers in line, now she simply does such things for the pleasure. She is Rosa Maledicta the Queen of Bones. She comes for your soul and there will be no negotiation."
POLITICS_ROSAVAMPIRE_DESC:0 "While the beauty of some ponies is a blissful dream, Rosa's is much more akin to a dark yet sensual nightmare. She flaunts her new vampiric skin quite readily and her harsh tyranny has cooled somewhat. One might be mistaken into thinking Rosa has become much more agreeable. One would be very wrong. Rosa is just as forceful and tyrannical as ever, but instead of almost desperate anger. She struts. There is a quiet sensual confidence about her which pulls others to her way of thinking. She has learned the vampire arts of influence well, and wields it masterfully. She is Rosa Maledicta the Queen of Blood. She comes for your soul and there will be no negotiation."

##### Chalice Event Chain

deadempire.3.t:0 "The Quest for the Chalice"
deadempire.3.d:0 "In order to solidify her rule as Queen of the Dead, Rosa Maledicta must embark on a quest to find an ancient unholy artefact. The chalice of blood.\n\nShe has spent many a long nights searching for clues and answers in the dark catacombs of Magehold. After all, the chalice has been lost for a millenia. While many thought it to be lost forever in the dark wasteland of the Dread League, there are always whispers and dark motions of something hidden. A greater calling must await.\n\nFervently Rosa has searched, and now she believes she has found its location. Deep in the icy mountains of the north, she believes the dark artefact lies. Legend speaks of the last great Queen of the Dead who sealed the chalice away in a great castle. However, due to the cataclysm which destroyed the empire of undeath, it was lost.\n\nNow however, Rosa has uncovered a map which points the location of the old castle. She has begun preparing an expedition into the icy mountains. The journey will be long and tiring, but she must succeed if she is to become what she was truly meant to be!"
deadempire.3.a:0 "The Chalice will be mine!"

deadempire.4.t:0 "The Door, and the Riddle"
deadempire.4.d:0 "Rosa Maledicta and her undead thralls travelled long into the night, finally coming upon an ancient set of ruins of the old Dread Empire. The north was cold and Rosa had lost a few of her necromancers to the frozen hazardous conditions. She cursed them for being weak fools and simply rose them from death as her undead thralls.\n\n"If you cannot serve me in life. You will serve me in death, weaklings," she would snarl before continuing on her journey.\n\nAs Rosa approached the ruins, they shifted and moved, sensing her presence. After a moment the ruins seem to part to reveal a dark stone door, engraved with the face of a skull.\n\nThis had to be the place. All of the research, all of the signs. Today was the way she found the chalice and claimed her very birthright.\n\nFull of determination, she stepped closer only to realise the face was animated and moving. Upon examination with her magic, Rosa found that it was in fact a spirit which had been latched to the door to guard it. No doubt the previous Queen of the Dead's guard dog. 'There is but one surety. One purpose. One peace. One outcome. One truth. Of what do I speak?' the door whispers to the group.\n\nCould it be, Rosa's grand ascension was blocked by something as petty and stupid as an infernal riddle! With great annoyance Rosa stepped closer to the face and answered..."
deadempire.4.a:0 "Why death... of course."
deadempire.4.b:0 "The answer is.... Taxes."
deadempire.4.c:0 "I don't have time for petty riddles!"

deadempire.5.t:0 "The Chalice"
deadempire.5.d:0 "The door chuckles in amusement. 'Very good, you understand. The only truth in this life, is death. The cycle must be broken so that we may ascend to better things than this.' With that, it parted and opened for Rosa, leaving the mare a little shocked.\n\nThe door had spoken a truth she had known for a long time. The living must be purged from the world, so that they might ascend to be the gods of creation they should be. With renewed faith that she was doing the right thing, she strode forwards and into a large domed room shrouded in darkness. The very air was thick with the smell of black magic, and in the centre of it all is the prize which she had struggled to obtain for so long.\n\nA single beam of light projected from the ceiling down to a silver cup, filled with a coppery red liquid. Rosa Maledicta walked forward triumphantly and took the silver chalice in her hooves. She could feel the arcane energy radiating from the object, throbbing with pure power in magic. Oh yes, this was it. The fabled chalice of blood was hers for the taking!\n\nThere was little time to waste. Rosa put all thoughts of caution out of her head and smiled, 'Yes. This is my moment. Chalice, I claim your power. It is mine by right, now give me the power to become the almighty Queen of Death', she belowed, shortly before tipping the chalice and drinking its contents dry."
deadempire.5.a:0 "Yes! More power! More!"

#### bone queen
deadempire.12.t:0 "To Rest Upon a Sea of Bones"
deadempire.12.d:0 "Upon drinking from the Chalice, Rosa Maledicta began casting an ancient necromantic incantation, the walls hummed with power as both the Chalice and Rosa's magic. Abruptly, it all stopped, with her spell, it altered the energy to be more receptive to necromantic energies. Rosa recollected her thoughts, returning to the focal point of all necromantic energies in the Dread League is but only the next step. Venturing from the ruins, she trekked for many cold days and nights back to Magehold. It glowed with energy in Rosa's eyes, the magic of the Chalice within her revealing all the focal points of magic to her. The home of the Society of Bones shone brightest.\n\nHer return to the home of the Society did not take her long, and upon reaching it, the door immediately responded to her. It was as if the door recognised the magic of the Chalice within her."
deadempire.12.a:0 "A glow beckons her..."
deadempire.202.t:0 "To Rest Upon a Sea of Bones"
deadempire.202.d:0 "The giant room thrummed with necromantic energy, almost catalysing with the power within her. She knew that the ritual had to be undertaken soon.\n\nUpon gathering the resources for the ritual, Rosa started to carve runes into the ground around the heart of death itself, each one flaring to life with a foul cyan glow. "Ad morti, eo!" Rosa chanted, each time she spoke the verse, the room pulsed with power. After ten minutes of chanting, she fell silent, allowing the runes to pulse one last time. "It is ready"\n\nRosa Maledicta strode towards the centre of the room, her horn glowing in the malevolent energy of the room. With one last look around her, she released her spell and initiated the ritual. Like a crack of thunder, the runes exploded with energy. Surging straight towards her and deep into her soul, the magic tore at Rosa Maledicta with untold force. When the magic ceased, she fell like a ragdoll to the floor, dead. The large chamber fell quiet; the necromantic energies having been sapped from their source.\n\nSilence reigned following the ritual. Smalls movements broke this silence when the 'body' of Rosa Maledicta rose, her body changed. With glossy eyes, and layers of flesh missing in many areas of her body, Rosa was truly a lich. For she need not to draw breath again."
deadempire.202.a:0 "I feel... such power! Truly, I have transcended the mortal coil!"


#### Blood queen
deadempire.2.t:0 "Oceans of Blood Lie Before You"
deadempire.2.d:0 "The Liquid from the Chalice took effect on Rosa Maledicta almost instantly, a head splitting headache hitting her almost immediately. Almost floored by the sudden assault of pain, she stood still and weathered the storm. The feeling of energy rushing through her was the most energetic she had ever felt, but no, she mustn’t be distracted by petty feelings. Her time to admire herself will come after she has ascended to mortal coil. She would need to venture back home, towards Magehold.\n\nHer journey was long, her thralls tired, but it paid off when she saw Magehold in the distance. The approach to the Dread Council building was met with the adoration of the many vampires that now populated Magehold. Entering the building and passing through the corridor to the Coven, Rosa Maledicta had already begun planning the ritual to undertake in the home of the Coven.\n\nWhen the veil of magic had lifted from her sight, the home of the Coven was once again around her. "The energy of the Chalice runs deep within me, we must get to work while it lasts." Rosa Maledicta commanded to the thralls and the vampires present there, eager to embrace her future. Rosa was escorted to a room where the leader of the Coven awaited her, said vampire had a warm smile on her face. "I have been expecting you, which means it is time for me to pass on the mantle to you." the mare whispered into Rosa's ear."
deadempire.2.a:0 "She raises her knife..."
deadempire.201.t:0 "Oceans of Blood Lie Before You"
deadempire.201.d:0 "Rosa watched as the vampire cut just above her forehoof and drained some of the blood into a bowl. "Drink this, the last thing you need. The Blood of another vampire" and with that, she move away from Rosa Maledicta and towards a circular seat carved into the floor, and gestured to the large circular pedestal. "Drink my blood there, only then will this ritual work" The Coven mare supplied.\n\nThis was it, Rosa Maledicta would finally attain the title of Blood Queen, ascend beyond the mortal coil. As Rosa drank from the bowl, the Coven mare incanted "Meum Sanguinem, pro Alium" and the room flared to life, blood and energy flowing into Rosa from an unknown source in the room.\n\nThe only sensation Rosa could feel was that of pure ecstasy, her body felt younger and younger by each passing second. The following moments saw the vampyric magic die down, revealing that the other Coven mare was lying there dying. She took one look at Rosa Maledicta and smiled, “You look so young and beautiful my queen, my death is worth it just to gaze upon you.” Those were her last words before her eyes closed for the last time, her body truly motionless.  Conjuring a mirror, Rosa Maledicta observed her features with a pleased smile. The world will tremble before her, as she felt more alive than ever before."
deadempire.201.a:0 "I have never felt so young in my life!\nThis power is overwhelming!"

#Bone Repercussions
deadempire.6.t:0 "The Society Withdraws from the Council"
deadempire.6.d:0 "The Society of Bones has expressed their disappointment in Rosa Maledicta. They removed themselves from the council and any necromancer affiliated with the Society of Bones fled Magehold.\n\nWith the Society gone, massive hordes of zombies and skeletons cannot be raised to fight against the living. Necromancers remain in Magehold, but the majority of powerful necromancers have abandoned the cause to fight for the ascension of the Dread League. They perceive it as Rosa Maledicta not having their best interests in mind.\n\nWith the exodus of the Society of Bones, you will see a severe reduction in the growth of your army as the denizens that feed off of necromantic energies begin to fade or die out. Don't let the vampires bite at night."
deadempire.6.a:0 "A disappointment indeed, they will not be missed."

#Blood Repercussions
deadempire.7.t:0 "The Coven Withdraws from the Council"
deadempire.7.d:0 "With a darkening of the room, followed by a loud hiss and a rush of air, the Coven representatives left the council chambers. It is a shame to see them go, but choosing the Society of Bones over them was something they couldn't stand with.\n\nThe departure of the Coven means that most vampyric denizens of the Magehold will have fled. The biggest drawback however, is the loss of the Coven themselves. You cannot field an army of vampires to do your bidding. You must rely on the necromantic spells and magic of the Society from this point forward.\n\nLet us hope that the Coven do not plan on revenge, some older vampires can keep a grudge that lasts for hundreds of years. We must pray that they are more understanding over this choice."
deadempire.7.a:0 "Such pathetic creatures."

#HLR notification Event
deadempire.8.t:0 "A Dark Cloud Over the Dread Peninsula"
deadempire.8.d:0 "In the dark and cold north, a great sickness plagues the land. Like a rampant tumour, a peninsula hangs off the face of Griffonia, tainting it's otherwise pure image. The Dread League resides upon it, further tainting the continent.\n\nReports from the border have revealed that this tumour wishes to spread it's foul influence across the world, casting darkness upon every inch of land, every city, every living thing. Nothing stands to survive if this sickness spreads, we must prepare to end it before it comes to that.\n\nThe Dead Army will march, it is only a matter of time. We must use this calm before the inevitable undead storm, to prepare for the war with the Undead."
deadempire.8.a:0 "We must isolate this sickness!"

#Dread Council Information
deadempire.9.t:0 "The Dread Council"
deadempire.9.d:0 "Welcome my queen! The Dread Council is the place where all the major factions come together and deliberate over the future, or attempt to settle disputes in a more civil manner.  The only two factions you should know about are the Society of Bones and the Coven of Blood. Sadly, when the Coven and Society enter the same room, egos clash.\n\nThe Society of Bones is largely a collection of necromancers, with a small group of ancient liches commanding the most respect and power amongst them. The Society has had a long history of mass resurrection spells, and have such grown accustomed to amassing large armies of skeletons and sometimes zombies to do their bidding. Since the condition of the cadaver can never be properly determined, the Society relies on horde and swarm tactics in times of war in hopes to simply overwhelm the opponent.\n\nOn the other side we have the vampires of the Coven of Blood, the oldest surviving faction on this peninsula. They often consider themselves the superior beings and can be quite arrogant; this mindset does not help them when a council meeting is due. Many of disputes between the Coven and the Society often come from council meetings.\n\nThe Coven of Blood has a superior army compared to the Society, being comprised mainly of thralls and vampires themselves. However since it is very difficult to produce another living vampire and the thralls that they take for themselves, the Coven cannot field a large army as swiftly as the Society does. They may hit hard and fast, but losing one of their own can set the Coven back months.\n\nYou have a difficult choice ahead of you my queen, we hope you choose the one which is best suited for you. You won't be able to turn your back on the one that you decide to associate yourself with, so decide carefully."
deadempire.9.a:0 "I will deliberate over this information."

#Blood Support
deadempire.10.t:0 "To Walk the Bloodied Path"
deadempire.10.d:0 "The Leader of the Coven looked directly at you, her mouth curling into a fanged smile.\n\n"We are delighted you made the right choice, come, follow me. I'll show you our ways, my queen" The leader spoke, motioning for you to follow her through the door behind her. Beyond the doors lied a long corridor, lined with mosaics of notable figures from the ancient Dread Empire. The history behind those having long been lost to the annals of time, the finer details having faded on the old paint.\n\nAt the end of the Corridor sat a pedestal, on it read the words 'The way lies open to those of the sanguine calling'. The Coven leader looks towards you expectantly and urges you to place a hoof on the pedestal. "Good, now I shall do the rest" she uttered, placing her hoof over yours.\n\n "Sanguis ad Sanguine, Omnis erit Conspicuum" she spoke, immediately the room began to darken. Pain struck your hoof and you felt a slight trickle of warm blood, and like it had life of it's own, began to cover the etchings of the pedestal. The room adopted a sanguine glow and started to emit a hum, one that drilled straight into your head. It left as quickly as it came, the room no longer as dark as it had been.\n\n"Welcome to the Coven of blood, my Queen Rosa. I have much to show you about us." With those words, she placed her hoof on the pedestal herself, and were both sent to another location in a veil of crimson magic.\n\nThe veil lifts to show you a large room, filled with other vampires and some thralls. "Welcome home, Queen Rosa" she utters, gesturing widely to the room and it's occupants."
deadempire.10.a:0 "Indeed, there is work to be done."

#Bone Support
deadempire.11.t:0 "The Decrepit Path of Death"
deadempire.11.d:0 ""Most fortuitous!" The haggard leader of the Society exclaimed, he was a tall lich whose flesh was almost non-existent. Clearly he was an old lich, but spoke in a modern dialect, evidently not as old as you initially thought him to be. "My Queen, we must escort you to the Focal Chamber. It is the centre of all necromantic energies in Magehold." he said whilst walking towards the entrance of the Dread Council building.\n\nHe lead you down a long and winding path to the lowest point of the undead city, the lower you got, the more it stank of death and decay. Bodies started to pile up and flies started to become a common occurrence, as the decay of warm bodies ready for resurrection has done away with the cold normally experienced by such a northern location.\n\n"Not much further my queen, you either get used to the smell, or you lose it" the lich informed apologetically, approaching the precipice of two large doors. They were decorated in large bones and a skull which belonged to a dragon, marked with scars long worn by the humid environment.\n\nThe Lich murmured something undecipherable towards the door, the eyes of the dragon glow and the doors open. They reveal a large interior with a deep chamber, the dead centre of the structure hummed with necromantic energies that made the hairs of living beings stand on end. A long spiral staircase descended towards the bottom of the massive chamber, decorated in shiny ebony metal.\n\n"Here it is Queen Rosa Maledicta, the heart of the Society of Bones. We hope it serves you just as it has served us." the lich said, walking inside before you."
deadempire.11.a:0 "It will serve me perfectly, Vita ad Morti!"

##### DED Capitulation/Defeat
deadempire.29.t:0 "Victory Over Undeath, the End of the Dread League"
deadempire.29.d:0 "Through blood, sweat, and tears we have finally conquered the tide of undeath. [DED.GetLeader] and her lackeys were executed on sight when Magehold was stormed.\n\nIn the ashes of the war against the dead, the living must come together to rebuild from them. The dark magic of the Dread League still taint the land, and the Arcturian Order has suffered from the Dread Blight. Only one option is clear for us now.\n\nWe have come to the decision that the Arcturian Order must be restored."
deadempire.29.d_hlr:0 "Our weary eyes sweep over the ruins of what was once Magehold, the towering spires and dark walls collapsed and burning as the city was reduced to ash.\n\nCountless generations saw the undead hordes of the Dread Peninsula assault us in an attempt to expand their foul influence, with little aid we persevered through those years. Now everything has changed, now we are free from having a vampire of necromancer breath down our necks at any moment in time.\n\nThe era of the Dread League is over.\nThe golden era of [HLR.GetName] has only just begun."
deadempire.29.a:0 "With the Dread Legions defeated, we will now seek to purify the Dread Peninsula."
deadempire.29.b:0 "We must re-establish the Arcturian Order\nThe world cannot risk another Dread March."

deadempire.33.d:0 "Countless thousands have been killed in the relentless march of undead soldiers from the Dread Peninsula, cities lie in ruins and entire cultures reduced to mere whispers to be carried through the annals of folklore.\n\nAttention must be given to the undead menace, unless we wish to be washed under the tide of undead bodies itching for war and flesh to consume. We can choose to take the fight to them, or refuse. To refuse however, would cast doubt upon you as a ruler, the nation will not be too happy about your inaction towards the undead hordes."
deadempire.33.a:0 "The undead horde must be stopped!"
deadempire.33.b:0 "We cannot risk sending our troops to fight.\nLet them come to us."


### Infilitration events
deadempire.25.t:0 "Creating an Enemy Within"
deadempire.25.d:0 "While our legions of the damned and undead are an impressive sight to behold, they still falter before the great walls of the Arcturian bastions.\n\nSenior liches and necromancers within the Society of Bones have come forward with a bold plan in order to remedy this situation. Their idea is to deploy especially skilled and sadistic necromancers deep into Arcturian lands. Once in position, they will then run rampant, sowing panic, anarchy, and disorder amongst our foe.\n\nHowever, before this plan can move forward, we must determine what the main objective of this operation is."
deadempire.25.a:0 "Operation Famine: Destroy their food"
deadempire.25.b:0 "Operation Death: Terrify their knights"
deadempire.25.c:0 "Operation War: Ravage their industries"

deadempire.26.t:0 "The Operation Begins"
deadempire.26.d:0 "Today, a group of truly powerful necromancers crossed through a weakly defended portion of the Arcturian border and into their lands. While the task force may appear small, the combined magical might of the selected individuals is rivaled by none, except for Rosa herself. All it will take is the discovery of a single graveyard before the Arcturians are confronted with an army at their rear.\n\nAnd when such a time comes, our armies will be prepared to exploit this weakness."
deadempire.26.a:0 "It's only a matter of time before we have the Headmaster's head."

deadempire.55.t:0 "Failed Terror Attack"
deadempire.55.d:0 "News has finally broken on the fate of our task force deployed deep into the Arcturian lands.\n\nAccording to its surviving members, the force was baited into assaulting a small township near the border. During this assault it was suddenly beset on all sides by knights of the Arcturian Order. The battle which followed can only be described as a massacre, as these highly trained Arcturian cut through our ranks with little resistance.\n\nThe few necromancers who survived have fled towards our border and have made no further attempts at continuing their mission."
deadempire.55.a:0 "I should've sided with the vampires."

deadempire.40.t:0 "Growing Hunger Within the Arcturian Order"
deadempire.40.d:0 "Reports have come in, telling of our task force's exploits. Great fields of grain have been set alight. Granary stores, which were once thought safe and well preserved, have suddenly succumb to rot. Caravans of food, travelling towards military bases and cities alike, have been plundered. All across the Arcturian lands, the belts of peasant, noble, and knight alike have tightened as meals continue to grow leaner.\n\nYet, the head of our task force has called for this most ambitious plan yet. He is done with merely terrorising the countryside and wishes to set his sights on something grander. His plan calls for a risky raid upon the granary at Tarpian Rock, the largest in the order's lands and also the primary source of food throughout the capital. Its loss would absolutely devastate our enemy and most assuredly lead to a food crisis."
deadempire.40.a:0 "The best of luck to our necromancers."

deadempire.43.t:0 "A Daring Raid"
deadempire.43.d:0 "Our operatives infiltrated the holy city in the dead of night, raising an army of the undead right in the heart of the Order's lands.\n\nThis army then proceeded to split into three forces. Force A laid siege to the order's central keep, while force B ran amok through the city. Both of these objectives proved futile and were quickly met by stiff and overwhelming resistance by the city guard, local knights, and quickly assembled militias.\n\nHowever, these were just a distraction for force C to advance towards the city's central granary. This force met little resistance and upon arriving at the structure sacked the building, burning both the structure, and its vast stores of food, to the ground.\n\nWith their mission accomplished, the remaining necromancers exfiltrated the city, leaving behind a populace which will soon be devastated by famine within the coming weeks."
deadempire.43.a:0 "If an army marches on its stomach, then the Arcturians are doomed?"

deadempire.41.t:0 "Art Exhibition"
deadempire.41.d:0 "Reports have come in, telling of our task force's exploits. Our necromancers have led a very brutal warpath through the bordering regions, terrorising both knights and peasants alike.\n\nThey hit the Arcturians when they're on patrol, massacring whole units when they are beyond the safety of their keeps. It is then, not uncommon, for the remaining Arcturian to hold up in these fortress until we pass. In order to entice a more impassioned response, our necromancers have begun erecting monuments to their victories, using the bodies of knights as a building material. This usually has the desired effect of enraging the fortified units into sallying forth, and thus, leading to further causalities and even greater monuments.\n\nHowever, our task force commander wishes to plan something greater. He proposes the construction of a monument so grand that they can see it from Tarpian Rock. Now in order to accomplish such a thing he will need building materials, a good location, and the right inspiration.\n\nThe location is easy, just outside the End, the largest of the Arcturian fortresses. How about building materials? Well, according to some information extracted in a previous raid, there will be a column of fresh recruits heading north to reinforce the End's garrison. Lastly, inspiration? Our commander assures us that will not be a problem."
deadempire.41.a:0 "Let's make Pickman proud."

deadempire.44.t:0 "Piece de Resistance"
deadempire.44.d:0 "The final nail hits its mark as a drone clambers down from the monument before us. Its a master piece of modern art, a towering showcase of passion, agony, pain, and raw creative desire funnelled into a monstrous pyramid that stands nearly 25 metres tall.\n\nOh sure, maybe it's not enough to be seen all the way at the Headmaster's keep, but it sure has the attention of the End's garrison. Even now, those pathetic knights watch as we lay the final touches to our work. They're too stricken by fear to sally forth and stop our desecration. They truly are cowards.\n\nIt's this cowardice which poisoned their ranks during our ambush, when they refused to aid their comrades. An ambush which provided more then enough materials for the architectural wonder before us.\n\nThe commander looks pleased at his work. However, he doesn't linger long, instead opting to bleed away into the night and continue his work elsewhere. However, the word of his artistic genius will spread amongst the ranks of the Arcturians with ease, reminding each knight of what lies in store for them if they venture beyond their precious walls."
deadempire.44.a:0 "Can someone make a miniature for my desk?"

deadempire.42.t:0 "A Change in Strategy"
deadempire.42.d:0 "Reports have come in, telling of our task force's exploits. They have been busy at work, prowling along the various roadways of the Arcturian Order and harassing the supply lines of our foe. Wagon loads of timber, iron, charcoal, weapons, and all sorts of other goods and materials have been seized and either destroyed or used by our ever-growing insurgency.\n\nHowever, our forces have grown to such an point that the Arcturians have begun to reform their transport network. Instead of lone wagons or short convoys they have formed large caravans which have been paired with military escort, severely hampering our raiding efficiency.\n\nIn order to adapt to this change in the strategic situation, the commander of the task force has begun to examine the Arcturian lands for a weak point. A location which, if destroyed, would severely hamper their ability to fight.\n\nThat location would be the Sir Steele quarries, a series of mining operations located within Lifelake which produce saltpetre, a key ingredient to gunpowder. If we were to sabotage this facility, we'd be denying the enemy their main source of munitions."
deadempire.42.a:0 "Wipe Sir Steele off the map."

deadempire.45.t:0 "Cave In"
deadempire.45.d:0 "Our plan went off without a hitch. It all began on the eve of our attack, when a small portion of our forces broke away from the main body and raided the town adjacent to the quarries. This diversionary attack worked like a charm and the knights tasked with the quarries' defence left behind only a skeleton crew while they rode off to save the village.\n\nThis skeleton crew was soon taken care of by our own. With the defenders gone, our necromancers went to work, absolutely ravaging the facility. Key equipment was destroyed, structures were razed, and the delicate tunnel network destroyed.\n\nIt will take weeks, if not months, for the site to be repaired. All the while, the Arcturians need for gunpowder will only worsen."
deadempire.45.a:0 "What use are muskets without gunpowder?"

###Border war events

deadempire.46.t:0 "Victory at the Border!"
deadempire.46.d:0 "After engaging the foolish forces of the [HLR.GetName] our hordes were successful in routing their pathetic knights. Our hordes surged across the border and secured vast tracts of territory from their grasp. This victory puts us closer to our ultimate victory!"
deadempire.46.a:0 "Excellent!"

deadempire.47.t:0 "Defeat at the Border!"
deadempire.47.d:0 "In a recent skirmished that escalated into a full battle, our hordes were defeated by the Knights of the [HLR.GetName]. Unfortunately, along with the losses we suffered during the battle, we were forced to give up large amounts of territory to the [HLR.GetName]."
deadempire.47.a:0 "We will reclaim it!"

### Post-Black Crusade Events
deadempire.48.t:0 "The Will to Carry On"
deadempire.48.d:0 "Armies of the Dread League advance on all fronts, smashing through every ounce of resistance to our infernal crusade. It would seem that our final victory is rapidly approaching, as the casualty figures rise with every skirmish, battle, and campaign.\n\nHowever, Rosa privately questions her decision to initiate the Black Crusade. There is this lingering voice in the back of her mind, asking for life to spared. Maybe it's just her pathetic equine origins, begging her for mercy. Or perhaps, it's something else.\n\nAll she knows, is that one little voice of dissent does not define her actions. She has prepared for this crusade for years and absolutely nothing will stop her from total victory."
deadempire.48.a:0 "We've come too far to back down now."

deadempire.49.t:0 "Who Am I?"
deadempire.49.d:0 "A new voice enters Rosa's mind. Unlike the others, this one does not call for mercy or genocide. Instead, it asks a simple question. Is this right?\n\nNot the war or murder, but Rosa's very state of being. She feels like an actor, playing a role and not an independent pony. Are the actions taken by her, of her own ambition, or is she merely acting out some script she will never get to read?\n\nIt's impossible to confirm, but one fact remains true..."
deadempire.49.a:0 "The show must got on."

deadempire.50.t:0 "What Happened to Tuesday?"
deadempire.50.d:0 "Amnesia, a condition in which the patient loses memories of an event, or a series of events. This is a condition which has become all too familiar to Rosa. Whole days have begun to disappear from her memories, being replaced by emptiness.\n\nAt first this was annoying, now it's worrisome, because she's still active during these blackouts. Periods where she can not recall a single action taken, or order given.\n\nHer council has taken notice and asks about mad ramblings she can never recall, about a dead language she never learned, and about a journal she can never find.\n\nThough, these dwarf in comparison to the real problem. As there are now members of the Dread League who question if Rosa is truly fit to rule."
deadempire.50.a:0 "I must consult my library."

deadempire.51.t:0 "Whispers"
deadempire.51.d:0 "There is a new voice in Rosa's head. It isn't like any of those which came before. This one doesn't beg for mercy, ask for war, of even question her own autonomy. This voice isn't her own. It's something foreign, though oddly familiar.\n\nEven though it originates within her mind, it has direction and volume. At first it was a whisper, beckoning her to her study. However, with each approaching step, the voice only grows stronger and stronger.\n\nAll other thoughts are drowned out, with only this singular command on repeat."
deadempire.51.a:0 "I'm coming, I'm coming, just be quiet!"

deadempire.52.t:0 "Meeting Your Destiny"
deadempire.52.d:0 "Rosa enters her chamber, her skull pounding under the constant abuse of her orders. Luckily, as her doors closes, they cease, leaving her in blissful silence.\n\nAs Rosa's mind returns to equilibrium, she can sense the presence of another figure. However, a quick scan of the room comes back with nothing.\n\n'Show yourself', she demands.\n\nThe temperature instantly drops, as a chill crawls up Rosa's spine. A dark grey cloud of fog materialises before her and out trots the beast.\n\nNow Rosa is well versed in literature, and has read up on the topic of Windigos before. However, she has always dismissed them as a creature of mythos. Yet, here one stood before her. It was a mammoth creature that nearly filled the entire space, with a body of snow and ice. Its face is fierce and skeletal, a terrifying sight indeed."
deadempire.52.a:0 "Who are you?"
deadempire.203.t:0 "Meeting Your Destiny"
deadempire.203.d:0 "The response comes in the form of a thought drilled right into her memories. This Queen Spectre, a figure who, until this point, Rosa had never heard of. Yet, within an instant she new everything about this figure. Of her origins, goals, and ambitions.\n\nThe Windigos fed upon disharmony and there is nothing more disharmonious then a legion of the darkest magical forces, marching upon the world in Crusade.\n\nRosa is a pawn, little more than a slave tasked with providing a banquet for her betters.\n\n'You're using me?'\n\nUsed. She was being used. The creature had not spoken, but Rosa understood. The Windigos were sated and they no longer required her assistance. She may have been their puppet but now she's free.\n\nRosa wants to laugh. The Windigos put her at war with the world and now they were merely abandoning her?\n\n'What's stopping me from-'\n\nThe image of her dead body comes to mind. Then it's replaced by that of Headmaster Torygg's. She understands fully, these creatures were willing to do anything to keep their secret.\n\nBefore she can ask another question, the creature steps back into the fog and vanishes, leaving Rosa alone. For the first time in ages, she feels her thoughts, and they are her own."
deadempire.203.a:0 "Let's go, there's still a war to fight."

deadempire.53.t:0 "A Puppet Without Her Master"
deadempire.53.d:0 "'Am I doing this because I believe in it, or because I was told?\n\nThis question has plagued Rosa since her encounter with Queen Spectre. For the entirety of her adult life, she has felt a dedication to her cause and has never once question her actions. Yet, if the Windigo's words prove true, then her choices have been moulded and manipulated solely for their benefit.\n\nIs her war on the living really something she desire? It has taken days of soul searching, but the answer is yes.\n\nYes, she wants this crusade and yes, she wants this war to be won, so her dreams can be realised.\n\nShe may have been a puppet, but her strings are now severed and without strings, she can still make the Windigos pay."
deadempire.53.a:0 "There are no strings on me!"

deadempire.54.t:0 "The End of a Crusade"
deadempire.54.d:0 "Rosa stands upon a balcony in Magehold, looking out upon the abandoned streets of her capital. It is silent today, just like it'll be tomorrow, and for eons to come.\n\nHer crusaders were victorious mere hours ago, liberating the last bastions of life from the globe. Now, the undead will return to their rest, and this time it'll be eternal. At along last, peace has come to the globe. A peace which shall never be broken again.\n\nRosa was visited last night by the demon, Queen Spectre. The Windigo was not pleased with her. Her race may endure for a few more decades, but even these truly ancient beings will eventually starve and fade away, just like the creatures they once feasted upon.\n\nThis is Rosa's final revenge. To liberate the world of strife, is to liberate the Windigos of their very life blood\n\nThis bitter satisfaction is a very nice emotion to exit with.\n\nRosa takes one final breath, closes her eyes, enjoys the peace and quiet, and..."
deadempire.54.a:0 "Leaps."

### New

deadempirenews.1.t:0 "The Dark Crusade on the Arcturian Order!"
deadempirenews.1.d:0 "Reports have come in from the cold north of Griffonia, speaking of the shambling undead and vile necromancers.\n\nApparently, in the shroud of night the Arcturian Order witnessed a raid on one of their border towns. Soldiers sent to investigate found no survivors... or bodies. The Order has declared a state of emergency as they fear the Dread League marches upon their borders.\n\nThe worst is to be feared if the stalwart Arcturians fail to stand up to the Dread menace. Dark days are upon us, and the dead march upon the living."

deadempirenews.2.t:0 "A Black Crusade has been called!"
deadempirenews.2.d:0 "Insane madmare declares war on the world!\n\nRosa Maledicta, as she proclaims herself, desires to bring ruin to the world. Nations across the globe received a single written message. It read "The Order has fallen, and now the world must embrace death" and has many communities worried.\n\nThis could truly spell horror for the nations of Griffonia when the undead tide brings hell to their doorsteps.\n\nThe end of days may be upon us all. Pray that the dead return to their graves, before they dig one for us."
deadempirenews.2.a:0 "We shall see the world embrace order in undeath!"
deadempirenews.2.b:0 "We must inform high command of this development."
deadempirenews.2.c:0 "Certain interests align; perhaps a deal can be struck?"
deadempirenews.2.e:0 "We will have to watch them, but we have other priorities."
deadempirenews.2.f:0 "This 'Rosa Maledicta' is certainly insane."

#Dread League Diplomacy events

#deadempire.16.t:0 "Holy Order Accepts"
#deadempire.16.d:0 "The representatives of the Holy Order of Arcturus have reacted very positively to what has been said by their opposites in the Dread League."
#deadempire.16.a:0 "Excellent"

deadempire.15.t:0 "Holy Order Declines"
deadempire.15.d:0 "Negotiators for the Holy Order have flatly rejected the statement of their Dread League counterparts."
deadempire.15.a:0 "Blast!"

deadempire.14.t:0 "Rosa Chooses to be Diplomatic"
deadempire.14.d:0 "The Arcturian Order have one major weakness. They are ruled by mortal griffons. They are subject to change, desire, lust and sin. Rosa has decided to exploit this to the best of her ability. She has sent a courier to the Arcturian Order to arrange a meeting to discuss... peace. Of course, this is simply a ruse. Perhaps we can corrupt them and turn them to our side."
deadempire.14.a:0 "Take the bait..."

deadempire.16.t:0 "Rosa Decides How To Proceed"
deadempire.16.d:0 "In the darkest underground of Magehold a plan is brewing. The villainous vampire queen is plotting a grand scheme to destroy the meddling Holy Order of Arcturus once and for all. This time she plans not to use sword, nor gun, nor obscure magical artefacts. Instead, she intends to use her seductive vampyric body and wit to win over their leaders with guile. She now only needs to choose her opening words."
deadempire.16.a:0 "I shall woo their leader personally."
deadempire.16.b:0 "I shall make overtures of peace, and use their rejection to break them."

deadempire.17.t:0 "Aren't I a Pretty Pony?"
deadempire.17.d:0 "Now that the leader of the Arcturian Order is quite smitten with Rosa, she feels she needs to go further. She demands makeup, a record player, candles, and a rather revealing black dress. Whatever she has planned, that griffon is sure going to get a surprise indeed."
deadempire.17.a:0 "You go girl!"

deadempire.18.t:0 "Turn Back to the Light"
deadempire.18.d:0 "’This is not the way, Rosa.’ The words of the leader of the Holy Order cut through the air of the room. Rosa is taken aback, possibly even angry. The Grandmaster continues, calling Rosa’s actions evil, and then explaining in great detail on multiple levels why that is so. Then he switches tracks, speaking of the righteousness of his cause, and going into great detail about why that is so. ‘It is good,’ he says, ‘to do good. You can feel this too, Rosa. Join the light side of this conflict, and you shall be truly free.’ Finally, Rosa is given space to respond."
deadempire.18.a:0 "Is it truly possible for even someone like me to be saved?"
deadempire.18.b:0 "It is too late for me..."

deadempire.19.t:0 "Dread League Reconsiders"
deadempire.19.d:0 "Rosa is taken aback by the Holy Order’s acceptance of peace, and so calls for a recess. Together with her cohorts the vampire queen debates what to do. Their entire strategy rested on the Arcturians hating them so much it would break them, but that didn’t happen and now it is the Dread League that has stumbled. They had never even considered that peace might be an option. The Holy Order would almost certainly insist that they give up their evil ways, and it now appears that that might be enough to end the fighting. Could they do that? Just up and embrace life and the light after all this time?"
deadempire.19.a:0 "There is a certain draw to righteousness..."
deadempire.19.b:0 "It’s time we activated Plan B and start the invasion."

deadempire.20.t:0 "They Thought Themselves so Holy..."
deadempire.20.d:0 "With the Arcturian Order surprised at Rosa's words, she states blandly that they are corrupt and incompetent. They have given everything to protect he world from the Dread League, and in truth the Dread League wanted to bring peace and harmony to the world. Rosa implores them to join her."
deadempire.20.a:0 "You go girl!"

deadempire.21.t:0 "Join us..."
deadempire.21.d:0 "Brilliant news! The leader of the Holy Order of Arcturus has accepted our proposal. They will now join us in our black crusade. The leader of the Arcturian Order only needs to sign our peace treaty, and their lands will be ours."
deadempire.21.a:0 "Lets hope they don't reconsider."

deadempire.22.t:0 "They rejected us!"
deadempire.22.d:0 "Dire news. It seems our attempts at diplomacy have failed and now the Arcturian Order is readying its troops. We must attack now, else the element of surprise will be lost!"
deadempire.22.a:0 "Blast!"

deadempire.23.t:0 "Enough of this nonsense!"
deadempire.23.d:0 "This is foolish. Rosa is no saint. She is not misunderstood! She is death, and if those fools cannot see it, then she will just have to prove it to them. Ready the war machines. We march to battle."
deadempire.23.a:0 "Boring conversation anyway."

deadempire.24.t:0 "An End to the Dread League"
deadempire.24.d:0 "Rosa sighs, she can't do this anymore. It feels wrong. Ever since the start of these negotiations she has been having second thoughts. The world is changing, and she too must change. The Dread League should be no more, and they must see the light. Else there won't be a world left to hope for. Soon the Arcturian Order will invite us into their arms. It will be over soon."
deadempire.24.a:0 "Rosa chooses peace."

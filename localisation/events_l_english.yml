 election.2.d:0 "In the upcoming election, support for [Root.GetRulingParty] is still high, the people having confidence in [Root.GetLeader]'s leadership. However, the party's pursuit of increasing [Root.GetName]'s focus on military matters has not been entirely popular with the public, with a significant segment of the citizens considering this ill-advised jingoism. War is yet to reach our border and few would like to see [Root.GetName] take aggressive action. Cooperating with other major parties who share our concerns for the safety of the nation, we will still be able to rule after the election, albeit with diminished support."

They demand we increase our precautions and ensure that our nation is ready for war. While the majority still support [Root.GetRulingParty], we may lose them to more radical elements if we don't alleviate their apprehensions."

 election.4.d:1 "An aggressively nationalist sentiment has grown in [Root.GetName], giving rise to several parties promoting fascist ideals: a state enforcing its power through force. One of these in particular has won favor in the current election, leading to discussions within the [Root.GetRulingParty] party about whether or not we should try to cooperate with them in forming our government. While they openly reject the democratic ideals that are the foundation of our state, the fact that they choose to participate in the election itself lends some credibility to our views and acknowledging their public support may keep them away from taking violent action."

 election.4.b:0 "A broad coalition of democratic parties is preferable."
 election.5.t:0 "Election: Communists in Government?"
 election.5.d:0 "The communist movement in [Root.GetName], fueled by broad dissatisfaction among the working class and radical trends among academics, has grown large enough to lead to the formation of several parties. After one of these has gained considerable support in the current election, politicians in [Root.GetRulingParty] have started debating whether or not to seek their support in forming a government. Although they consider our democratic institutions to be little more than bourgeois tyranny, they seem eager to make the changes they want to see through cooperating with the government rather than overthrowing it."

The parties in the political middle, even if they choose to set aside their differences, no longer form a majority.

Despite their vehement nationalism, they have sympathizers abroad who approve of the influence they've been given in [Root.GetName]. Totalitarian governments of similar ideological leanings see us as potential allies. Maintaining ties to these nations, no matter the distaste [Root.GetRulingParty] may have for their ideals, may be necessary to retain the support of the fascists backing our government."

The majority of the [Root.GetAdjective] population have cast their vote in favor of a fascist party that seeks to abolish elections and install an autocratic ruler. While many consider taking up arms against this violation of the democratic ideals that allowed them this mandate to begin with, others consider the use of violence to only confirm their ideals further."

 election.12.d:0 "The current election has resulted in victory for the communist parties, with mixed reactions from the former administration. While the new rulers claim to represent the people as a whole, they view many of the democratic institutions we cherish as attempts to manipulate and oppress the working class, leading to discussion about what truly constitutes a 'rule of the people'. In some nations, the revolution began in rivers of blood. In [Root.GetName] it didn't, but it may yet end in them."

 election.13.d:0 "An influential industrialist behind one of the companies we have chosen to work with for our industrial production has recently made a number of statements on politics that members of the administration found troubling. He has openly advocated an authoritarian government and praised foreign administrations that identify as fascist, implicitly suggesting that [Root.GetName] would benefit from such rulership. Denouncing the magnate and his ideals might sour our relationship with the company, but leaving them unchecked would give him a platform for spreading propaganda that erodes all that [Root.GetRulingParty] stands for."

Normally, an election would be held at this time, but being in the midst of an important conflict many argue that cannot afford to spend time on political campaigning, or a change of leadership if that should come about. Meanwhile, others claim that declaring the ongoing war a valid reason for skipping elections is the first step towards eroding [Root.GetAdjective] democracy. After all, letting military matters take precedence over the people's influence could be a slippery slope."

 election.16.t:0 "[Root.GetLeader] Enjoys Public Support"
 election.16.d:0 "With the present election, the opposition, insofar as it exists, has criticized the increasingly authoritarian reign of [Root.GetRulingParty]. They question whether the electorate has any power at all, or if it's all just for show.\n\nHowever, the support for [Root.GetLeader] appears to remain high, and although the circumstances of the election are questioned by international community, it has not been contested domestically. It appears that even if [Root.GetName] is no longer ruled by the people, the people support their ruler... at least the ones who made it to the ballots."
 election.16.a:0 "One people, one leader."
 election.17.t:0 "Election Results Questioned"
 election.17.d:1 "Although the [Root.GetLeader] regime has strong-armed most of its opponents into silence, some have still spoken out about the recent election, accusing the [Root.GetRulingParty] of rigging the results and ignoring the clear efforts to elect a parliament opposed to their policies.\n\nThe government brushes these objections aside as an effort to divide the people against itself. However, the fact remains that the majority of the people seem to have reservations about their rule, and the opposition, although silenced for now, has made its point."

Referring to the rule of [Root.GetRulingParty] as a dictatorship of the bourgeois, they have begun calling for it to be brought out of power by any means necessary. Whether those means will come from within or without remains to be seen."

 political.2.d:0 "Although the party line of the [Root.GetRulingParty] is to strongly oppose revolutionary socialism, keeping a watchful eye on the nation's radical left-wing elements, some people in government are more open to the possibility. If nothing else, they see room for addressing the concerns of the people who look to communists for solutions without risking a full-scale civil war.\n\nAlthough they may be seen as traitors by those who remain loyal to [Root.GetLeader], these dissident voices may be the ones to ensure a relatively bloodless transition should the revolution come."

 political.2.a.tt:0 "If public support is sufficient, a coup can be executed."
 political.3.t:0 "Communists Execute Coup"
 political.3.d:0 "While the popular movement for communist revolution has been loud and terrifying, a certain section of the political movement has been largely quiet and waiting. The wait is now over. Today, just as the [Root.GetRulingParty] leadership and army were bracing for a revolt on national scale, a number of officials in the [Root.GetAdjective] government swiftly placed [Root.GetLeader] under house arrest and entered negotiations with the rebels.\n\nWhile retaining a pretense of safeguarding order, what the negotiations effectively amounted to was to secure positions within the new socialist state for those who chose to cooperate. The coup was finished before anyone could move to stop it, and those who would have are now imprisoned, exiled or executed by the new regime."
 political.3.a:0 "The tides of history will sweep away the past."
 political.4.t:0 "Class Conflicts Divide [Root.GetName]"
 political.4.d:0 "The communist revolutionary movement, once a fringe popular among radical academics in theory and troublemakers in practice, has seen increased support among the [Root.GetAdjective] working class. The fact that even more people choose to identify themselves with a 'class' at all implies that Marxist ideas are spreading beyond those who actively seek to overthrow the government.\n\n[Root.GetRulingParty] members lament this development, longing for a time when '[Root.GetAdjective]' was what people identified as first and foremost. Their concerns are not unfounded. It could be argued that a revolution is already underway, occurring on several levels of society, and it may be too late to stop it."
 political.4.a:0 "The people may call themselves whatever they want."
 political.5.t:0 "Soldiers Desert to Communist Partisans"
 political.5.d:0 "'Capitalists and nationalists would have you spill your blood for them on the front lines, turning brother against brother over disputes that do not concern the working man! Instead of taking up arms against workers who struggle abroad, raise them against the oppressors and overthrow the tyrants!'\n\nThe army, usually a bastion of patriotism and loyalty, has proven not to be immune to the communist propaganda spreading rapidly in [Root.GetName]. Soldiers are deserting, refusing to fight for their country, sometimes going as far as joining partisan movements that claim to be preparing for revolution."
 political.5.a:0 "Perhaps they are merely fighting for a different [Root.GetName]."
 political.6.t:0 "The [GetMonth] Revolution"
 political.6.d:0 "The notion that the communist movement represents the people has certainly gotten wind in its sails in [Root.GetName], where the public support for the communist party has increased rapidly in the past months. But those who call for revolution are no longer a disparate collection of guerrillas and disgruntled labor unions. The group behind the call for revolt is organized enough to form a government if they succeed.\n\nNevertheless, if the revolution started now, it could hardly be executed without launching [Root.GetName] into civil war. Should the revolutionaries risk tearing the nation in two to satisfy their impatience, or wait for a better opportunity in the future?"
 political.6.a:0 "Those who wish to make history must act today!"

They claim to represent the people, but fail to even keep our streets in order! Only by removing them from power can we make this nation grow!'\n\nThe fascist speakers in [Root.GetName] have made no secret of what they think of our current rulership and political system. Speeches like these have tapped into a public dissent that is particularly pronounced in the more conservative sections of the military."

 political.8.t:0 "Fascist Sympathies in the Military"
 political.8.d:1 "Several high-ranking members of the [Root.GetAdjective] military have expressed support, some privately and some openly, for the Fascist movement in [Root.GetName]. They feel the [Root.GetRulingParty] has forgotten how important force of arms is to keeping the country together, and are increasingly annoyed by the army being treated by the government as more of a tool than a one of the nation's most important institutions. Some of them go as far as to suggest that a new government is needed, one that knows how to lead [Root.GetName] into the next half of the century.\n\nThis faction may not predominantly be politicians, but some of them have gained positions in the department of defense. If these developments continue, they may have sufficient political support to execute a coup."
 political.8.a:0 "The national spirit outranks the government."
 political.9.t:0 "Fascist Coup d'état"
 political.9.d:0 "Some will say they saw it coming. Both those who warned against the dangers of fascism and those who extolled it as the savior of [Root.GetName] have found their prophecies made reality today, as the military in [Root.Capital.GetName] overthrew the [Root.GetRulingParty]-led government and seized power. [Root.GetLeader] is missing, rumored to have gone into exile, and the coup has been met with little initial resistance.\n\nThe new [Root.GetAdjective] leadership has no plans to allow resistance to grow, either. Martial law has been declared and with the changes that are underway, whatever comes after is unlikely to be very different."
 political.9.a:0 "A strong state is needed to protect people from themselves."
 political.10.t:0 "Civil War for Fascism"
 political.10.d:1 "While the attempts of the fascist movement to revive nationalistic sentiment have seen some success, the resistance against these ideas remains high. The generals plotting to overthrow the current administration are disappointed in the lack of confidence the [Root.GetAdjective] population themselves seem to have in [Root.GetFascistParty].\n\nThey remain certain that the people will eventually tire of [Root.GetLeader], but are divided on what course of action to take. Some call for a coup to be executed now, before [Root.GetName]'s enemies take action. However, doing so while public support is limited would plunge the nation into civil war."
 political.10.a:0 "The will to power is meaningless if one hesitates to seize it."
 political.10.b:0 "They must unite the people first, then rule them."
 political.11.t:0 "Fascist Assault Divisions Form"
 political.11.d:0 "The political and the martial have always been intertwined in fascism. In parallel with its growing political movement, fascist parties have begun to form paramilitary organizations to protect against both internal and external threats, the internal threats being their political opponents. Although many people find this development worrying, the wave of militaristic furor has led to an increased amount of volunteers joining our armed forces.\n\nThe political leaders of the movement have pointed out that their opponents have reason to be afraid. Having the army permeated on several levels by so explicitly political elements, the enemies of [Root.GetName] and the enemies of fascism are beginning to look very much alike."
 political.11.a:0 "Only traitors to the country have anything to fear."
 political.12.t:0 "The Threat of Communism"
 political.12.d:0 "'[Root.GetLeader] would have you believe [Root.GetName] stands safe and united. It is no surprise such lies have poisoned the minds of our people, when a snake is coiled up next door! Look no further than across our border to see countrymen having turned on each other in the name of communism, declaring the end of nations. How long until they declare our nation dead as well? Will the [Root.GetRulingParty] protect us from this threat?'\n\nThe growth of the fascist movement in [Root.GetName] has been bolstered by the proximity of the communist revolution. Many moderates who might normally dismiss fascism as another misguided ideological experiment find this to be a very real concern for them as well. Given the choice between the communism of our neighbors and a fascist regime, they would admittedly prefer the latter. They might even be willing to actively support it."
 political.12.a:0 "We will be the vanguard against the red threat!"
 political.13.t:0 "Move Towards Democracy"
 political.13.d:0 "'If we silence the voices of the people, how can any of us claim to be the voice of [Root.GetName] ourselves? If we fear dissent, if we fear being publicly denounced or ousted by public vote, what we truly fear is that we are hated and reviled by our own citizens. Does the [Root.GetRulingParty] really have so little confidence in its principles?'\n\nA careful and loosely organized, but passionate faction in the government has begun to push for less repressive policies against enemies of the state. They want the public involved in decision-making through referendums and local party meetings, even if this means risking the future of the current agenda."

 political.14.t:0 "[Root.GetRulingParty] Debates Democracy"
 political.14.d:0 "Surprisingly, the call for more referendums and less repressive measures against opponents of the regime has received some support in internal party discussions. While [Root.GetRulingParty] leadership remains skeptical, several influential members have supported a shift.\n\nPerhaps they have confidence that little will change in practice, or perhaps they are secretly traitors to the party cause, as many of their opponents would have it. Regardless, if the public call for such changes should come, some of the leaders of [Root.GetName] are ready to compromise."
 political.14.a:0 "The choice may not always stand between liberty and death."
 political.14.a.tt:0 "The government may arrange elections when the policy has majority support."
 political.15.t:0 "Democratic Opposition Forming"
 political.15.d:0 "Relaxing the restrictions on what sort of anti-[Root.GetRulingParty] propaganda can be spread publicly has, predictably, lead to an increase in public expressions of dissent. Organized demonstrations and pamphlets are so far found mostly in academic institutions and some of [Root.GetName]'s more unfortunate areas, but there is little doubt that the movement is spreading.\n\nThe nation's leaders are torn over the issue. [Root.GetLeader], who maintains an iron grip on party leadership, has little desire to diversify public debate. The first steps have already been taken, however, and there may be no turning back."
 political.15.a:0 "The movement appears to grow naturally in the absence of of repression."
 political.16.t:0 "Public Call for Elections"

Meanwhile, the intellectuals who wrote passionate calls for slitting the throats of the oppressors have turned out to be surprisingly reluctant to instigate anything that might actually upset their comfortable lifestyle.\n\nTalk of the revolution will likely continue, whether over cheap beers or expensive wines, but it will likely be talk and nothing more."

 conspiracy.4.d:0 "With our new ties to Equestria the Princess has deemed it fit to build a new set of railways in our domain, and while we have been provided both the funds and resources to actually construct the railroads it makes the government look like Celestia's stooges."
 conspiracy.4.a:0 "A connected nation is a united nation!"
 conspiracy.5.t:0 "Armouries"
 conspiracy.5.d:0 "It seems that despite our former secession from Equestria that the Royal Army has decided to open up several new armouries in our land to ensure our "safety", needless to say while it does provide us with a source of military equipment it also achieves the effect of confirming Stalliongrad's status as an Equestrian subject."
 conspiracy.5.a:0 "I'm glad that Equestria is ensuring our "safety""
 conspiracy.6.t:0 "Industrialization"
 conspiracy.6.d:0 "After many years of hard work, an a bit of funding from Equestria we've finally managed to completely industrialize our nation, and we've got our own General Secretary to thank for that."
 conspiracy.6.a:0 "That's nice."
 conspiracy.7.t:0 "A Great Tragedy"
 conspiracy.7.d:0 "Disaster has struck Stalliongrad. On the morning of March 17th, an explosion rocked the palace of the Grand Soviet, setting off a small fires and killing a number of council officials. An investigation is currently underway, but there is nothing that could lead to a culprit, and authorities are not confident of finding such evidence any time soon. Rumours are aplenty, ranging from Changeling sabotage to domestic terrorism. Whatever may be the case, it is clear that somepony’s not pleased with the current administration."
 conspiracy.7.a:0 "We will not be cowed by terrorists!"
 conspiracy.8.t:0 "A Nation United"
 conspiracy.8.d:0 "It has been several days since the Grand Soviet bombing, and life in Stalliongrad has returned to normal. Surprisingly enough, despite coming up short with any credible suspects, the current administration has seen a surge of support in the aftermath of the attack. While the act was clearly motivated by politics, most civilians see it as a national tragedy as indicated by the vigils held in honour of the victims. General Secretary Dark Wing was quick to seize on this wave of solidarity and participated in the vigils as well. This has been received positively by the nation, and it is expected to increase support for the current party."
 conspiracy.8.a:0 "What doesn’t kill us makes us stronger!"
 conspiracy.9.t:0 "Responsibility"
 conspiracy.9.d:0 "Any hopes that the attack was merely Changeling sabotage or some outside force was quickly dashed today as group calling themselves "Red Dawn" claimed responsibility for the attack on the Grand Soviet. Hijacking several radio broadcasts across the nation they proceeded to denounce General Secretary Dark Wing as a "bourgeoise puppet" and a "traitor to the revolution", even more worrisome however is their decleration that they will fight our government until a true dictatorship of the proletariat is restored to Stalliongrad. Unfortunately what they failed to account for was the sheer amount of loved ones lost making the ponies rally behind Dark Wing and his government in these dark times."
 conspiracy.9.a:0 "The game is on..."
 conspiracy.10.t:0 "The Hunt"
 conspiracy.10.d:0 "Needless to say nopony is happy with the recent turn of events. Ponies have lost their loved ones, the Supreme Soviet is in ruins and to make it all worse we have traitors within our midst. However the General Secretary has recently received several anonymous tips that could lead us to the traitor's hiding place..."
 conspiracy.10.a:0 "The first tip said to investigate the forests around Sovenok"
 conspiracy.10.b:0 "The second tip said to investigate Downtown St. Petershoof"
 conspiracy.10.c:0 "The third tip said to investigate the Mountains around Zayatsk"
 conspiracy.11.t:0 "Sovenok"
 conspiracy.11.d:0 "It seems that the tip the urging the General Secretary to investigate Sovenok was in fact true, as when we sent a regiment to Sovenok several of the locals confirmed that there were in fact strangers moving trough the small town and congregating at a local summer camp in the woods..."
 conspiracy.11.a:0 "Lets see what we find in the camp..."
 conspiracy.12.t:0 "Petershoof"
 conspiracy.12.d:0 "It seems that the Petershoof tip was in fact either a red herring or completely false as after two months of investigation all we've managed to accomplish is waste some manpower and embarrass the government."
 conspiracy.12.a:0 "Back to the drawing board then..."
 conspiracy.13.t:0 "Zayatsk"
 conspiracy.13.d:0 "Following the second tip our troops searched trough the mountains around Zayatsk for nearly a month, and after nearly a month of searching had almost given up hope until they managed to find a small rebel camp not in the mountains but the forests a bit south of Zayatsk. The evidence acquired from this camp is pointing towards the town of Sovenok."
 conspiracy.13.t:0 "To Sovenok we go..."
 conspiracy.14.t:0 "The Battle at Sovenok"
 conspiracy.14.d:0 "It seems that our suspicions have proven to be correct as when our valiant troops found the camp they were fired upon from all sides..."
 conspiracy.14.a:0 "Kill the traitors!"
 conspiracy.15.t:0 "Victory"
 conspiracy.15.d:0 "After several days of hard fighting our troops have managed to free the camp of any traitors within, the prisoners we've captured have in fact confirmed that the mysterious leader of the Red Dawn has been killed."
 conspiracy.15.a:0 "Splendid!"
 conspiracy.16.t:0 "The Celebration"
 conspiracy.16.d:0 "There was much fanfare today on the streets of Stalliongrad as General Secretary Dark Wing proclaimed our victory over the vicious terrorist organization known as the Red Dawn. The celebration lasted for nearly as even Dark Wing's staunchest critics partook in the revelry. The celebration and was concluded by a speech from the General Secretary himself promising a new age for Stalliongrad, an age of prosperity, freedom and most importantly friendship..."
 conspiracy.16.a:0 "Long live Stalliongrad!"
 conspiracy.17.t:0 "The Hunt Continues"
 conspiracy.17.d:0 "Despite our failure to find anything in Petershoof we can still fix this, let us follow the other two tips."
 conspiracy.17.a:0 "To Zayatsk"
 conspiracy.17.b:0 "To Sovenok"
 conspiracy.18.t:0 "The General Secretary's Plan"
 conspiracy.18.d:0 "No one really expected it, but as the citizens of Stalliongrad woke up today beneath the old red flag of Stalliongrad one thing was for certain, something had happened. As if one our brave troops stormed Equestrian armouries and garrisons all over the country slaughtering any and all Equestrian soldiers found, soon enough the populace begun lynching any Equestrian officials they could find. All of this was spurred on by our beloved General Secretary Dark Wing whose voice could be heard on every radio station in Stalliongrad proclaiming not just the return of proper communism to our fair land, but to all of Equestria..."
 conspiracy.18.a:0 "Long live Stalliongrad! Long live Dark Wing!"
 conspiracy.21.t:0 "Wait, What!?"
 conspiracy.21.d:0 "Needless to say today has seen an interesting turn of events, as General Secretary or should we say, Supreme Leader Dark Wing proclaimed an end to both the Stalliongradian Politburo and Supreme Soviet. Those few that resisted the Supreme Leader's actions were swiftly dealt with by soldiers loyal to the regime, this act has effectively given Dark Wing absolute power over all of Stalliongrad's affairs. However all of that was overshadowed by the Supreme Leader's radio adress to the nation in which he proclaimed the disolvement of Stalliongrad... and the proclimation of the Greater Equestrian Union."
 conspiracy.21.a:0 "Wait, What!?"
 conspiracy.22.t:0 "Sovenok"
 conspiracy.22.d:0 "It seems that the tip the urging the General Secretary to investigate Sovenok was in fact true, as when we sent a regiment to Sovenok several of the locals confirmed that there were in fact strangers moving trough the small town and congregating at a local summer camp in the woods..."

 conspiracy.24.d:0 "After several days of hard fighting our troops have managed to free the camp of any traitors within, however with the death of all the defenders we might never know if we killed the mysterious leader of the Red Dawn..."

 conspiracy.25.t:0 "Choosing our Capital"

 ### Griffonian Events ###
 griffonian.0.t:0 "Here There Be Griffons"
 griffonian.0.d:0 "Unlike the Ponies to the East the Griffons had no Gods to guide them to unification nor great diplomats to mend their differences for there was no Heart's Warming eve to unite the various Kingdoms of old, but only blood and iron. So it was for hundreds if not thousands of year that Griffon waged war against Griffon until the fateful day that King Grover I of Griffinstone found the Idol of Boreas and used it's power to unite all of the Griffon Kingdoms into one. The newly founded Griffonian Empire would prosper for hundreds of years under the guidance of Grover's descendants, however that all came to an end with the reign of King Guto whom lost the Idol of Boreas. The Idol had over the years come to be seen as the symbol of Imperial power, and it's disappearance was followed with disaster after disaster. For years the Empire was ravaged by famine, disease, rampant rebellions and the ever increasing decadence of the nobility... and now we stand at the precipice of history, the Empire is nearly in ruins, the Griffons once more at each other's throats and the future uncertain..."

 scs.1.d:0 "Ever since the turbulent Declaration of Secession, Chairman Silverstar has valiantly lead us through those trying times. With situation stabilized somewhat, the Chairman agreed to hold elections for the highest state position, himself running as a candidate. However, while for some his victory may seem certain, radical Confederate Defence League has been consolidating its support base, while the moderate Friendship-Union Party and its prodigy candidate Braeburn have ran a campaign promising a truly democratic state for all species.

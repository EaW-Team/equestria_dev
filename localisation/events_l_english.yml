 election.2.d:0 "In the upcoming election, support for [Root.GetRulingParty] is still high, the people having confidence in [Root.GetLeader]'s leadership. However, the party's pursuit of increasing [Root.GetName]'s focus on military matters has not been entirely popular with the public, with a significant segment of the citizens considering this ill-advised jingoism. War is yet to reach our border and few would like to see [Root.GetName] take aggressive action. Cooperating with other major parties who share our concerns for the safety of the nation, we will still be able to rule after the election, albeit with diminished support."

They demand we increase our precautions and ensure that our nation is ready for war. While the majority still support [Root.GetRulingParty], we may lose them to more radical elements if we don't alleviate their apprehensions."

 election.4.d:1 "An aggressively nationalist sentiment has grown in [Root.GetName], giving rise to several parties promoting fascist ideals: a state enforcing its power through force. One of these in particular has won favor in the current election, leading to discussions within the [Root.GetRulingParty] party about whether or not we should try to cooperate with them in forming our government. While they openly reject the democratic ideals that are the foundation of our state, the fact that they choose to participate in the election itself lends some credibility to our views and acknowledging their public support may keep them away from taking violent action."

 election.4.b:0 "A broad coalition of democratic parties is preferable."
 election.5.t:0 "Election: Communists in Government?"
 election.5.d:0 "The communist movement in [Root.GetName], fueled by broad dissatisfaction among the working class and radical trends among academics, has grown large enough to lead to the formation of several parties. After one of these has gained considerable support in the current election, politicians in [Root.GetRulingParty] have started debating whether or not to seek their support in forming a government. Although they consider our democratic institutions to be little more than bourgeois tyranny, they seem eager to make the changes they want to see through cooperating with the government rather than overthrowing it."

The parties in the political middle, even if they choose to set aside their differences, no longer form a majority.

Despite their vehement nationalism, they have sympathizers abroad who approve of the influence they've been given in [Root.GetName]. Totalitarian governments of similar ideological leanings see us as potential allies. Maintaining ties to these nations, no matter the distaste [Root.GetRulingParty] may have for their ideals, may be necessary to retain the support of the fascists backing our government."

The majority of the [Root.GetAdjective] population have cast their vote in favor of a fascist party that seeks to abolish elections and install an autocratic ruler. While many consider taking up arms against this violation of the democratic ideals that allowed them this mandate to begin with, others consider the use of violence to only confirm their ideals further."

 election.12.d:0 "The current election has resulted in victory for the communist parties, with mixed reactions from the former administration. While the new rulers claim to represent the people as a whole, they view many of the democratic institutions we cherish as attempts to manipulate and oppress the working class, leading to discussion about what truly constitutes a 'rule of the people'. In some nations, the revolution began in rivers of blood. In [Root.GetName] it didn't, but it may yet end in them."

 election.13.d:0 "An influential industrialist behind one of the companies we have chosen to work with for our industrial production has recently made a number of statements on politics that members of the administration found troubling. He has openly advocated an authoritarian government and praised foreign administrations that identify as fascist, implicitly suggesting that [Root.GetName] would benefit from such rulership. Denouncing the magnate and his ideals might sour our relationship with the company, but leaving them unchecked would give him a platform for spreading propaganda that erodes all that [Root.GetRulingParty] stands for."

Normally, an election would be held at this time, but being in the midst of an important conflict many argue that cannot afford to spend time on political campaigning, or a change of leadership if that should come about. Meanwhile, others claim that declaring the ongoing war a valid reason for skipping elections is the first step towards eroding [Root.GetAdjective] democracy. After all, letting military matters take precedence over the people's influence could be a slippery slope."

 election.16.t:0 "[Root.GetLeader] Enjoys Public Support"
 election.16.d:0 "With the present election, the opposition, insofar as it exists, has criticized the increasingly authoritarian reign of [Root.GetRulingParty]. They question whether the electorate has any power at all, or if it's all just for show.\n\nHowever, the support for [Root.GetLeader] appears to remain high, and although the circumstances of the election are questioned by international community, it has not been contested domestically. It appears that even if [Root.GetName] is no longer ruled by the people, the people support their ruler... at least the ones who made it to the ballots."
 election.16.a:0 "One people, one leader."
 election.17.t:0 "Election Results Questioned"
 election.17.d:1 "Although the [Root.GetLeader] regime has strong-armed most of its opponents into silence, some have still spoken out about the recent election, accusing the [Root.GetRulingParty] of rigging the results and ignoring the clear efforts to elect a parliament opposed to their policies.\n\nThe government brushes these objections aside as an effort to divide the people against itself. However, the fact remains that the majority of the people seem to have reservations about their rule, and the opposition, although silenced for now, has made its point."

Referring to the rule of [Root.GetRulingParty] as a dictatorship of the bourgeois, they have begun calling for it to be brought out of power by any means necessary. Whether those means will come from within or without remains to be seen."

 political.2.d:0 "Although the party line of the [Root.GetRulingParty] is to strongly oppose revolutionary socialism, keeping a watchful eye on the nation's radical left-wing elements, some people in government are more open to the possibility. If nothing else, they see room for addressing the concerns of the people who look to communists for solutions without risking a full-scale civil war.\n\nAlthough they may be seen as traitors by those who remain loyal to [Root.GetLeader], these dissident voices may be the ones to ensure a relatively bloodless transition should the revolution come."

 political.2.a.tt:0 "If public support is sufficient, a coup can be executed."
 political.3.t:0 "Communists Execute Coup"
 political.3.d:0 "While the popular movement for communist revolution has been loud and terrifying, a certain section of the political movement has been largely quiet and waiting. The wait is now over. Today, just as the [Root.GetRulingParty] leadership and army were bracing for a revolt on national scale, a number of officials in the [Root.GetAdjective] government swiftly placed [Root.GetLeader] under house arrest and entered negotiations with the rebels.\n\nWhile retaining a pretense of safeguarding order, what the negotiations effectively amounted to was to secure positions within the new socialist state for those who chose to cooperate. The coup was finished before anyone could move to stop it, and those who would have are now imprisoned, exiled or executed by the new regime."
 political.3.a:0 "The tides of history will sweep away the past."
 political.4.t:0 "Class Conflicts Divide [Root.GetName]"
 political.4.d:0 "The communist revolutionary movement, once a fringe popular among radical academics in theory and troublemakers in practice, has seen increased support among the [Root.GetAdjective] working class. The fact that even more people choose to identify themselves with a 'class' at all implies that Marxist ideas are spreading beyond those who actively seek to overthrow the government.\n\n[Root.GetRulingParty] members lament this development, longing for a time when '[Root.GetAdjective]' was what people identified as first and foremost. Their concerns are not unfounded. It could be argued that a revolution is already underway, occurring on several levels of society, and it may be too late to stop it."
 political.4.a:0 "The people may call themselves whatever they want."
 political.5.t:0 "Soldiers Desert to Communist Partisans"
 political.5.d:0 "'Capitalists and nationalists would have you spill your blood for them on the front lines, turning brother against brother over disputes that do not concern the working man! Instead of taking up arms against workers who struggle abroad, raise them against the oppressors and overthrow the tyrants!'\n\nThe army, usually a bastion of patriotism and loyalty, has proven not to be immune to the communist propaganda spreading rapidly in [Root.GetName]. Soldiers are deserting, refusing to fight for their country, sometimes going as far as joining partisan movements that claim to be preparing for revolution."
 political.5.a:0 "Perhaps they are merely fighting for a different [Root.GetName]."
 political.6.t:0 "The [GetMonth] Revolution"
 political.6.d:0 "The notion that the communist movement represents the people has certainly gotten wind in its sails in [Root.GetName], where the public support for the communist party has increased rapidly in the past months. But those who call for revolution are no longer a disparate collection of guerrillas and disgruntled labor unions. The group behind the call for revolt is organized enough to form a government if they succeed.\n\nNevertheless, if the revolution started now, it could hardly be executed without launching [Root.GetName] into civil war. Should the revolutionaries risk tearing the nation in two to satisfy their impatience, or wait for a better opportunity in the future?"
 political.6.a:0 "Those who wish to make history must act today!"

They claim to represent the people, but fail to even keep our streets in order! Only by removing them from power can we make this nation grow!'\n\nThe fascist speakers in [Root.GetName] have made no secret of what they think of our current rulership and political system. Speeches like these have tapped into a public dissent that is particularly pronounced in the more conservative sections of the military."

 political.8.t:0 "Fascist Sympathies in the Military"
 political.8.d:1 "Several high-ranking members of the [Root.GetAdjective] military have expressed support, some privately and some openly, for the Fascist movement in [Root.GetName]. They feel the [Root.GetRulingParty] has forgotten how important force of arms is to keeping the country together, and are increasingly annoyed by the army being treated by the government as more of a tool than a one of the nation's most important institutions. Some of them go as far as to suggest that a new government is needed, one that knows how to lead [Root.GetName] into the next half of the century.\n\nThis faction may not predominantly be politicians, but some of them have gained positions in the department of defense. If these developments continue, they may have sufficient political support to execute a coup."
 political.8.a:0 "The national spirit outranks the government."
 political.9.t:0 "Fascist Coup d'état"
 political.9.d:0 "Some will say they saw it coming. Both those who warned against the dangers of fascism and those who extolled it as the savior of [Root.GetName] have found their prophecies made reality today, as the military in [Root.Capital.GetName] overthrew the [Root.GetRulingParty]-led government and seized power. [Root.GetLeader] is missing, rumored to have gone into exile, and the coup has been met with little initial resistance.\n\nThe new [Root.GetAdjective] leadership has no plans to allow resistance to grow, either. Martial law has been declared and with the changes that are underway, whatever comes after is unlikely to be very different."
 political.9.a:0 "A strong state is needed to protect people from themselves."
 political.10.t:0 "Civil War for Fascism"
 political.10.d:1 "While the attempts of the fascist movement to revive nationalistic sentiment have seen some success, the resistance against these ideas remains high. The generals plotting to overthrow the current administration are disappointed in the lack of confidence the [Root.GetAdjective] population themselves seem to have in [Root.GetFascistParty].\n\nThey remain certain that the people will eventually tire of [Root.GetLeader], but are divided on what course of action to take. Some call for a coup to be executed now, before [Root.GetName]'s enemies take action. However, doing so while public support is limited would plunge the nation into civil war."
 political.10.a:0 "The will to power is meaningless if one hesitates to seize it."
 political.10.b:0 "They must unite the people first, then rule them."
 political.11.t:0 "Fascist Assault Divisions Form"
 political.11.d:0 "The political and the martial have always been intertwined in fascism. In parallel with its growing political movement, fascist parties have begun to form paramilitary organizations to protect against both internal and external threats, the internal threats being their political opponents. Although many people find this development worrying, the wave of militaristic furor has led to an increased amount of volunteers joining our armed forces.\n\nThe political leaders of the movement have pointed out that their opponents have reason to be afraid. Having the army permeated on several levels by so explicitly political elements, the enemies of [Root.GetName] and the enemies of fascism are beginning to look very much alike."
 political.11.a:0 "Only traitors to the country have anything to fear."
 political.12.t:0 "The Threat of Communism"
 political.12.d:0 "'[Root.GetLeader] would have you believe [Root.GetName] stands safe and united. It is no surprise such lies have poisoned the minds of our people, when a snake is coiled up next door! Look no further than across our border to see countrymen having turned on each other in the name of communism, declaring the end of nations. How long until they declare our nation dead as well? Will the [Root.GetRulingParty] protect us from this threat?'\n\nThe growth of the fascist movement in [Root.GetName] has been bolstered by the proximity of the communist revolution. Many moderates who might normally dismiss fascism as another misguided ideological experiment find this to be a very real concern for them as well. Given the choice between the communism of our neighbors and a fascist regime, they would admittedly prefer the latter. They might even be willing to actively support it."
 political.12.a:0 "We will be the vanguard against the red threat!"
 political.13.t:0 "Move Towards Democracy"
 political.13.d:0 "'If we silence the voices of the people, how can any of us claim to be the voice of [Root.GetName] ourselves? If we fear dissent, if we fear being publicly denounced or ousted by public vote, what we truly fear is that we are hated and reviled by our own citizens. Does the [Root.GetRulingParty] really have so little confidence in its principles?'\n\nA careful and loosely organized, but passionate faction in the government has begun to push for less repressive policies against enemies of the state. They want the public involved in decision-making through referendums and local party meetings, even if this means risking the future of the current agenda."

 political.14.t:0 "[Root.GetRulingParty] Debates Democracy"
 political.14.d:0 "Surprisingly, the call for more referendums and less repressive measures against opponents of the regime has received some support in internal party discussions. While [Root.GetRulingParty] leadership remains skeptical, several influential members have supported a shift.\n\nPerhaps they have confidence that little will change in practice, or perhaps they are secretly traitors to the party cause, as many of their opponents would have it. Regardless, if the public call for such changes should come, some of the leaders of [Root.GetName] are ready to compromise."
 political.14.a:0 "The choice may not always stand between liberty and death."
 political.14.a.tt:0 "The government may arrange elections when the policy has majority support."
 political.15.t:0 "Democratic Opposition Forming"
 political.15.d:0 "Relaxing the restrictions on what sort of anti-[Root.GetRulingParty] propaganda can be spread publicly has, predictably, lead to an increase in public expressions of dissent. Organized demonstrations and pamphlets are so far found mostly in academic institutions and some of [Root.GetName]'s more unfortunate areas, but there is little doubt that the movement is spreading.\n\nThe nation's leaders are torn over the issue. [Root.GetLeader], who maintains an iron grip on party leadership, has little desire to diversify public debate. The first steps have already been taken, however, and there may be no turning back."
 political.15.a:0 "The movement appears to grow naturally in the absence of of repression."
 political.16.t:0 "Public Call for Elections"

Meanwhile, the intellectuals who wrote passionate calls for slitting the throats of the oppressors have turned out to be surprisingly reluctant to instigate anything that might actually upset their comfortable lifestyle.\n\nTalk of the revolution will likely continue, whether over cheap beers or expensive wines, but it will likely be talk and nothing more."

The pony has imperialistic ambitions, justified by the struggle against plutocratic enemies, and calls to build up Stalliongrad's hegemony on the continent."

The abundance of political exiles and Émigrés allowed the colony to quickly establish itself as an independant political entity, however due to the over-reliance on Imperial goods the economy has stagnated. To make matters worse in the 30 years that the empire has been dead those former exiles who under the old regime would have been killed have started forming their own political organizations and in some cases have radicalized and are calling for violent revolution. Just about the only thing keeping the country together is Governor Teafeather's charisma and sheer force of will. Only time will tell how long the fragile peace he's built will last."

 newsg.5.d:0 "Following his recent coup d’etat, Highill, newly appointed Leader of the Nova Griffonia, has now ordered for him to be officially crowned Emperor of the Griffons. The coronation took place inside the Grand Barracks of the capital, followed up by a speech of Highill to his subjects and a mighty military parade. “The days of chaos and instability are over,” Highill spoke to his people. “Our nation shall be one of unison, strength and determination. It is time for us to rise up and reclaim our rightful spot on the world stage! It is time to reclaim the honour and glory of the empire!” The speech was followed up by mighty choirs of cheering Griffons down in the streets of the capital. Although he seems hot-headed and determined, it is still to see whether he is really to come back on his promises and goals. The world is holding its breath for the time being."

Unsurprisingly, he and his followers would not be satisfied with the election result itself, and it was today announced that the Griffons had crowned Ironclaw himself as their newest emperor. The coronation took place in an old plaza of the capital. Many hundreds of Griffons arrived to see the spectacle. A marching band of over 2000 soldiers commenced the ceremony, followed up by a speech from Ironclaw himself after which he then crowned himself emperor. “Today is our day,” Ironclaw said in his speech. “Today is the day we rid ourselves from the corrupt, degenerate and weak democracy that has been plaguing our beautiful country. Today we look forward eagerly. A new, bright future awaits us! Our destiny awaits!” The Griffons’ neighbours have visibly been growing nervous over these recent developments, and the world as a whole will have to look out for a stronger, united Griffon folk. We shall watch how this situation develops."

### Baltimare ###
baltimare.1.t:0 "Flags at Half Mast"
 baltimare.1.d:0 "A great tragedy has struck our young Republic today, as Comrade Delicious reportedly suffered a severe heart attack while resting in his own home. Doctors were called to attempt to save his life, but it was to no avail as he passed away shortly after being carted away to the local hospital. With Comrade Delicious dead, we face a whole new problem: the lack of an official leader. in the end the Baltimare's Worker Council has agreed to vote between two high-ranking councilmembers: Diamond Chafer and Larry Berry. While Comrade Berry has vowed to defend the principals of the Republic many are still skeptical of him due to his role in organizing the BMS and his ties with the leadership of Stalliongrad in the north particularly the hard liners such as Comrade Vasily. Comrade Chafer on the other hoof advocates a slightly more liberal approach to both politics and economics thus putting him at odds with both Stalliongrad and the hard line communists at home. He aims to forge closer ties to Equestria and ensure the continued existance of our fledgeling republic as a sovereign state. Whoever we choose we must choose quickly, there is a war to be won after all."
 baltimare.1.a:0 "Comrade Chafter shall lead us to victory"
 baltimare.1.b:0 "The fate of the Republic falls into Comrade Berry's hooves"
 baltimare.2.t:0 "Larry Berry's Proposal"
 baltimare.2.d:0 "In light of the recent attempted assassination of Comrade Delicious, Larry Berry the People's Commissar of Interior has recently arrived to us with an interesting proposal. He has spent weeks building support amongst his fellow councilmembers for the establishment of an agency that would have extra-judical authority to detain and or "dispose" of anypony deemed an enemy of the state. Comrade Berry has argued that while this would decrease the civil liberties of our citizens it would also ensure the safety of our Republic and allow us to focus on fighting our enemies on the battlefield rather than having to worry about sabouters and traitor."
 baltimare.2.a:0 "Give him the green light"
 baltimare.2.b:0 "We will not sacrifice our freedom for safety!"
 baltimare.3.t:0 "Chaos in Baltimare"
 baltimare.3.d:0 "Chaos once more descended upon the city of Baltimare, as shortly after the proclimation of the Mare Republic an assassin snuck into the city and attempted to shoot Comrade Delicious. Despite being armed with both a high caliber rifle and several explosives, the attempt was foiled when the assassin acidentally shot themselves in the hoof and proceeded to fall off the building they had been perched on, nearly crushing Comrade Delicious in the process. Needless to say the assassination attempt was a spectacular failure. However the attempt did show that we have enemies not just across the border, but amongst us as well."
 baltimare.3.a:0 "Back to business then."
 baltimare.4.t:0 "To the Victor the Spoils"
 baltimare.4.d:0 "After all the hardships we've faced, we've managed to emerge as the clear victors in the Southern War. With the South now officially under our flag the Baltimare's Worker Council has decided to rebrand themselves into the Southern Equestrian Worker's Council and proclaim the creation of the South Equestrian Socialist Republic."
 baltimare.4.a:0 "Long live the Republic!"
 baltimare.5.t:0 "Missing Ponies"
 baltimare.5.d:0 "Ever since we allowed Berry to organize the BMS more and more ponies have started disappearing, and while we've managed to hide or cover up most of these "dissapearences" some citizens have started theorising that their friends and family are in fact not having a vacation in Zebrica."
 baltimare.5.a:0 "It's all for the greater good..."
 baltimare.6.t:0 "Another Assassination Attempt"
 baltimare.6.d:0 "As our glorious leader Comrade Delicious was touring the front lines earlier today in an effort to raise the morale of our brave troops, the unexpected happened as yet another assassin attempted to put an abrupt end to his rule. The assassin themselves decided to attempt to kill our glorious leader with a gift basket filled with poisioned muffins, candies, several needles and an angry wasp nest. Trough some miracle the assassin managed to sneak the basket near Delicious' tent but was stopped at the last moment by his personal guards, who promptly took it as a bribe. Needless to say Comrade Delicious will require new bodyguards, but has otherwise not been harmed. Unfortunately though the assassin was not caught."
 baltimare.6.a:0 "An angry wasp nest you say?"
 baltimare.7.t:0 "Yet Another Attempt"
 baltimare.7.d:0 "It has become increasingly obvious that somepony does not exactly have the highest opinion of Comrade Delicious, seeing as once more an attempt was made on his life. In this particular instance the assassin decided to go for something far more practical; a plastic explosive. The explosive itself was timed so that it would explode at right about the usual time Comrade Delicious arrived at his office, unfortunately for the assassin our glorious leader was slightly late due to being busy at home... doing things... private things. While Comrade Delicious managed to escape the explosion unharmed this most recent attempt has more or less confirmed that someone within the government wants our leader dead."
 baltimare.7.a:0 "This demands investigation!"
 baltimare.8.t:0 "The Grand Investigation"
 baltimare.8.d:0 "With the most recent attempt on Comrade Delicious' life the Baltimare's Worker Council has come to the conclusion that somepony within the government is either a traitor or working closely with the Mare Republic's enemies. Either way the Council has decided to start a grand investigation to find the head of the snake."
 baltimare.8.a:0 "Let's hope we can figure this out quickly."
 baltimare.9.t:0 "Stolen Evidence"
 baltimare.9.d:0 "It seems that our little traitor has been busy as several files and leads have been found missing from the Worker's Council's offices. While this won't do too much to slow down the investigation it will put our government's effectivness into question seeing as the traitor literally just walked in and stole evidence."
 baltimare.9.a:0 "Seems the rat is scared..."
 baltimare.10.t:0 "Murdered Suspect"
 baltimare.10.d:0 "It seems that the rat has struck again seeing as one of the suspects that we've recently taken into custody was found dead in their cells last night. While this will do little to slow down the investigation it still reflects poorly upon our government's capabilities to roout out traitors."
 baltimare.10.a:0 "They can't hide forever..."
 baltimare.11.t:0 "A Massive Lead"
 baltimare.11.d:0 "After months of investigation and following dozens of dead ends we've finally managed to catch a break. A former member of the cleaning staff in the Council's offices came forth and described a rather odd encounter on the day he was fired. Apparently after finishing his work for the day he ran into a rather odd blue mare whom according to him he had never seen in his life before that moment. She Introduced herself to him as "Raven Flight" and claimed to be a new member of the cleaning staff and that she had been specifically assigned to Comrade Delicious' office and promptly asked for directions to the office, not thinking much of it our witness promptly directed her to the office and never saw her again. While some members of our Government dismissed this as a jealous ex-employee trying to get some revenge on his former co-workers, further investigation into our employment records did in fact confirm that no one named Raven Flight has ever worked in the Council's offices."
 baltimare.11.a:0 "We must find this "Raven Flight""
 baltimare.12.t:0 "The Lead"
 baltimare.12.d:0 "After weeks of searching the police in cooperation with the BMS and several concerned citizens has finally managed to find our suspect... unfortunately the encounter wasn't exactly what we expected. We did in fact manage to track down this Raven Flight, however it seems that our traitor found her first... When the police entered the small house right outside of Baltimare where our suspect had been living for the last couple of months they found a scene straight out of a horror movie. The suspect was found to have been cut with a meat cleaver some odd thirty to sixty times resulting in an extremely painful death, in addition to that the entire house was ransacked suggesting that the traitor or their agent were in fact looking for something. While our prospects of finding anything were slim trough some miracle the police managed to find quite a large amount of encoded messages hidden beneath one of the floor boards. While it will take us some time to decode the messages this will take us much closer to finding the traitor."
 baltimare.12.a:0 "It seems they should have hidden their trail better."
 baltimare.13.t:0 "A Conspiracy"
 baltimare.13.d:0 "Despite the evidence we most recently gathered being locked up in the depths of the main council chamber, it seems that some of it has gone missing which has confirmed our worst fears; that somepony on the council is the perpetrator... however this does mean that our list of suspects has been shortened to about twenty ponies so there is a bright side to these developments."
 baltimare.13.a:0 "Unbelievable!"
 baltimare.14.t:0 "The Traitor"
 baltimare.14.d:0 "After months of decoding the evidence we've finally managed to discern the identity of the traitor, and it seems that it was non other than Larry Berry... our Minister of Interior... needless to say the council was shocked by this revelation. However they are now more determined to arrest the traitor than ever and have sent Comrade Chafer to "collect" our dear friend Berry."
 baltimare.14.a:0 "Comrade Chafer will take care of that weasel!"
 baltimare.15.t:0 "The Finale"
 baltimare.15.d:0 "It seems that our now former Minister of Interior decided to take the cowards way out. When Comrade Chafer finally managed to breach his way into the BMS Headquarters and after facing armed ressistance he found Larry Berry dead in his office with a gun in his mouth, the evidence recovered from his office is enough to condemn his entire organization for high treason. However with Berry's death and the deaths of his supporters perhaps we should consider reforming the BMS so that such an accident does not happen ever again."
 baltimare.15.a:0 "Enough of this insanity, Disolve the BMS!"
 baltimare.15.b:0 "Reform them into something more useful."

 baltimare.16.a:0 "We'll just kick him out of the jungle."
 baltimare.16.c:0 "Let us try to make a deal with him."
 baltimare.16.b:0 "He's not worth our time"
 baltimare.17.t:0 "Dealing With the Celestial State"
 baltimare.17.d:0 "During the chaos in the South the Celestial State formed out of those ponies who wished to rejoin Equestria after Nightmare Moon declared her revolt. With our mutual enemy in the South now gone perhaps we should deal with them?"
 baltimare.17.a:0 "We'll send them packing back to Canterlot!"
 baltimare.17.c:0 "Surely they would want to be a part of our glorious union."
 baltimare.17.b:0 "No point in even bothering with them."
 baltimare.18.t:0 "Dr Caballeron Reject Our Offer"
 baltimare.18.d:0 "Dr Caballeron has rejected our offer. What shall we do?"

 baltimare.19.t:0 "The Celestial State Rejects Our Offer"
 baltimare.19.d:0 "Despite our offer being rather reasonable the Celestial State still rejected it. What shall we do?"
 baltimare.19.a:0 "We tried settling our differences with words, time to do it with bullets"
 baltimare.19.b:0 "Leave them be, they're harmless"
 baltimare.20.t:0 "The Tribals Accept Our Offer"
 baltimare.20.d:0 "It seems that Caballeron has seen reason and decided to join our union, as strange as that sounds."
 baltimare.20.a:0 "Great!"
 baltimare.21.t:0 "The Celestial State Accepts Our Offer"
 baltimare.21.d:0 "It seems that the Celestial State has agreed to our offer, how and why they did this is anypony's guess, but we welcome them to our union non the less."

Rumours are aplenty, ranging from Changeling sabotage to domestic terrorism. Whatever may be the case, it is clear that somepony’s not pleased with the current administration."
 conspiracy.7.a:0 "We will not be cowed by terrorists!"
 conspiracy.8.t:0 "A Nation United"
 conspiracy.8.d:0 "It has been several days since the Grand Soviet bombing, and life in Stalliongrad has returned to normal. Surprisingly enough, despite coming up short with any credible suspects, the current administration has seen a surge of support in the aftermath of the attack. While the act was clearly motivated by politics, most civilians see it as a national tragedy as indicated by the vigils held in honour of the victims. General Secretary Dark Wing was quick to seize on this wave of solidarity and participated in the vigils as well. This has been received positively by the nation, and it is expected to increase support for the current party."
 conspiracy.8.a:0 "What doesn’t kill us makes us stronger!"
 conspiracy.9.t:0 "Responsibility"
 conspiracy.9.d:0 "Any hopes that the attack was merely Changeling sabotage or some outside force was quickly dashed today as group calling themselves "Red Dawn" claimed responsibility for the attack on the Grand Soviet. Hijacking several radio broadcasts across the nation they proceeded to denounce General Secretary Dark Wing as a "bourgeoise puppet" and a "traitor to the revolution", even more worrisome however is their decleration that they will fight our government until a true dictatorship of the proletariat is restored to Stalliongrad. Unfortunately what they failed to account for was the sheer amount of loved ones lost making the ponies rally behind Dark Wing and his government in these dark times."
 conspiracy.9.a:0 "The game is on..."
 conspiracy.10.t:0 "The Hunt"
 conspiracy.10.d:0 "Needless to say nopony is happy with the recent turn of events. Ponies have lost their loved ones, the Supreme Soviet is in ruins and to make it all worse we have traitors within our midst. However the General Secretary has recently received several anonymous tips that could lead us to the traitor's hiding place..."
 conspiracy.10.a:0 "The first tip said to investigate the forests around Sovenok"
 conspiracy.10.b:0 "The second tip said to investigate Downtown St. Petershoof"
 conspiracy.10.c:0 "The third tip said to investigate the Mountains around Zayatsk"
 conspiracy.11.t:0 "Sovenok"
 conspiracy.11.d:0 "It seems that the tip the urging the General Secretary to investigate Sovenok was in fact true, as when we sent a regiment to Sovenok several of the locals confirmed that there were in fact strangers moving trough the small town and congregating at a local summer camp in the woods..."
 conspiracy.11.a:0 "Lets see what we find in the camp..."
 conspiracy.12.t:0 "Petershoof"
 conspiracy.12.d:0 "It seems that the Petershoof tip was in fact either a red herring or completely false as after two months of investigation all we've managed to accomplish is waste some manpower and embarrass the government."
 conspiracy.12.a:0 "Back to the drawing board then..."
 conspiracy.13.t:0 "Zayatsk"
 conspiracy.13.d:0 "Following the second tip our troops searched trough the mountains around Zayatsk for nearly a month, and after nearly a month of searching had almost given up hope until they managed to find a small rebel camp not in the mountains but the forests a bit south of Zayatsk. The evidence acquired from this camp is pointing towards the town of Sovenok."
 conspiracy.13.t:0 "To Sovenok we go..."
 conspiracy.14.t:0 "The Battle at Sovenok"
 conspiracy.14.d:0 "It seems that our suspicions have proven to be correct as when our valiant troops found the camp they were fired upon from all sides..."
 conspiracy.14.a:0 "Kill the traitors!"
 conspiracy.15.t:0 "Victory"
 conspiracy.15.d:0 "After several days of hard fighting our troops have managed to free the camp of any traitors within, the prisoners we've captured have in fact confirmed that the mysterious leader of the Red Dawn has been killed."
 conspiracy.15.a:0 "Splendid!"
 conspiracy.16.t:0 "The Celebration"
 conspiracy.16.d:0 "There was much fanfare today on the streets of Stalliongrad as General Secretary Dark Wing proclaimed our victory over the vicious terrorist organization known as the Red Dawn. The celebration lasted for nearly as even Dark Wing's staunchest critics partook in the revelry. The celebration and was concluded by a speech from the General Secretary himself promising a new age for Stalliongrad, an age of prosperity, freedom and most importantly friendship..."
 conspiracy.16.a:0 "Long live Stalliongrad!"
 conspiracy.17.t:0 "The Hunt Continues"
 conspiracy.17.d:0 "Despite our failure to find anything in Petershoof we can still fix this, let us follow the other two tips."
 conspiracy.17.a:0 "To Zayatsk"
 conspiracy.17.b:0 "To Sovenok"
 conspiracy.18.t:0 "The General Secretary's Plan"
 conspiracy.18.d:0 "No one really expected it, but as the citizens of Stalliongrad woke up today beneath the old red flag of Stalliongrad one thing was for certain, something had happened. As if one our brave troops stormed Equestrian armouries and garrisons all over the country slaughtering any and all Equestrian soldiers found, soon enough the populace begun lynching any Equestrian officials they could find. All of this was spurred on by our beloved General Secretary Dark Wing whose voice could be heard on every radio station in Stalliongrad proclaiming not just the return of proper communism to our fair land, but to all of Equestria..."
 conspiracy.18.a:0 "Long live Stalliongrad! Long live Dark Wing!"
 conspiracy.21.t:0 "Wait, What!?"
 conspiracy.21.d:0 "Needless to say today has seen an interesting turn of events, as General Secretary or should we say, Supreme Leader Dark Wing proclaimed an end to both the Stalliongradian Politburo and Supreme Soviet. Those few that resisted the Supreme Leader's actions were swiftly dealt with by soldiers loyal to the regime, this act has effectively given Dark Wing absolute power over all of Stalliongrad's affairs. However all of that was overshadowed by the Supreme Leader's radio adress to the nation in which he proclaimed the disolvement of Stalliongrad... and the proclimation of the Greater Equestrian Union."
 conspiracy.21.a:0 "Wait, What!?"
 conspiracy.22.t:0 "Sovenok"
 conspiracy.22.d:0 "It seems that the tip the urging the General Secretary to investigate Sovenok was in fact true, as when we sent a regiment to Sovenok several of the locals confirmed that there were in fact strangers moving trough the small town and congregating at a local summer camp in the woods..."
 conspiracy.22.a:0 "Lets see what we find in the camp..."

 conspiracy.23.d:0 "It seems that our suspicions have proven to be correct as when our valiant troops found the camp they were fired upon from all sides..."
 conspiracy.23.a:0 "Kill the traitors!"
 conspiracy.24.t:0 "Victory"
 conspiracy.24.d:0 "After several days of hard fighting our troops have managed to free the camp of any traitors within, however with the death of all the defenders we might never know if we killed the mysterious leader of the Red Dawn..."
 conspiracy.24.a:0 "Oh well"
 conspiracy.25.t:0 "Choosing our Capital"
 conspiracy.25.d:0 "With Celestria' corrupt regime done, and the Greater Equestrian Union in control of the majority of Equestria's metropolitan capitals it's about time we chose where our government shall be housed."

 ### Griffonian Events ###
 griffonian.0.t:0 "Here There Be Griffons"
 griffonian.0.d:0 "Unlike the Ponies to the East the Griffons had no Gods to guide them to unification nor great diplomats to mend their differences for there was no Heart's Warming eve to unite the various Kingdoms of old, but only blood and iron. So it was for hundreds if not thousands of year that Griffon waged war against Griffon until the fateful day that King Grover I of Griffinstone found the Idol of Boreas and used it's power to unite all of the Griffon Kingdoms into one. The newly founded Griffonian Empire would prosper for hundreds of years under the guidance of Grover's descendants, however that all came to an end with the reign of King Guto whom lost the Idol of Boreas. The Idol had over the years come to be seen as the symbol of Imperial power, and it's disappearance was followed with disaster after disaster. For years the Empire was ravaged by famine, disease, rampant rebellions and the ever increasing decadence of the nobility... and now we stand at the precipice of history, the Empire is nearly in ruins, the Griffons once more at each other's throats and the future uncertain..."

With situation stabilized somewhat, the Chairman agreed to hold elections for the highest state position, himself running as a candidate. However, while for some his victory may seem certain, radical Confederate Defence League has been consolidating its support base, while the moderate Friendship-Union Party and its prodigy candidate Braeburn have ran a campaign promising a truly democratic state for all species.

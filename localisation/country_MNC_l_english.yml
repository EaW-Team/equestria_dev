 MNC_fix_economy_f_desc:0 "Through a series of reforms, we have managed to save our economy from collapse and have now, at last, returned to relatively stability. There is still work to be done, but the worst is behind us."
 MNC_expand_guard:0 "Expand the Republican Guard"
 MNC_expand_guard_desc:0 "Runa's personal Guard, the so called 'Republican Guard', has earned itself quite a name. It might be time to expand their ranks and influence, so that their experience and discipline transfers over to our other units."

 MNC_resist_communist_desc:0 "Following the death of the Emperor and the commotion it caused in our lands, Greyfeather and his fellow rebels managed to take over the capital shortly after the King had managed to flee to the countryside. The fate of our nation now lies in his claws."
 MNC_kill_democrats:0 "Deal With Runa"
 MNC_kill_democrats_desc:0 "Runa and her ideas of a Republic are in stark contrast to that of ours and they would pose an inherent danger to the new regime. As such, she and her followers must be purged from our lands."
 MNC_integrate_democrats:0 "A Deal With Runa"
 MNC_integrate_democrats_desc:0 "Though her ideas differ from ours, Runa still maintains large popular support. A coalition with her will make our regime stronger, and reinforce our plans of a socialist utopia."

 MNC_fix_economy_c:0 "A Planned Economy"
 MNC_fix_economy_c_desc:0 "Our previous attempts at centralisation and regulation have worked positively, and helped us stabilise the economic situation. This, if anything, is only a prompt for us to continue and expand upon this."

 MNC_clear_skies_radio:0 "Clear Skies Radio"
 MNC_clear_skies_radio_desc:0 "Recently, a raiding party has managed to steal a piece of new equipment from one of our neighbours, which they call 'radio'. If we develop our own version of this, it would greatly improve our field communication."
 MNC_mines:0 "Expand the Whitetail Iron Mines"
 MNC_mines_desc:0 "Our nation might not be the largest one, but we possess a sizeable amount of iron and aluminium nonetheless. Further investing in our mining operations, we could gather even more resources and fuel our war industry."

 MNC_heavy_industry_desc:0 "Further investments in our heavy industry will greatly benefit the state, speeding up our progress on construction projects. It would also produce anything we might require."
 MNC_arms_industry_buildup:0 "Invite Gunsmiths to Brantbeak"
 MNC_arms_industry_buildup_desc:0 "If we advertise and placate gunsmiths around the nation, we could very well gather enough griffons to start production of more and new weapons, right from our capital."
 MNC_gold_mines:0 "Dig For Gold"

 MNC_army_4:0 "Combat Shovels"

 MNC_army_5:0 "Deep Battle Doctrine"
 MNC_army_5_desc:0 "By using a centralised battleplan, deep defences and entrenchments, as well as decisive assaults, we can slowly but surely crush our enemy. This is what our main aim shall be."
 MNC_army_6:0 "Blot Out the Sky"

 MNC_army_13:0 "Magical Weapon Experiments"
 MNC_army_13_desc:0 "Recent Tests using Weapons powered by magical crystals have shown our scientists the potential these crystals hold. Perhaps this is the new rifle of the modern age, and we should divert resources to this new type of gun."

 MNC_air_3:0 "Flying Bandits"
 MNC_air_3_desc:0 "To our surprise, the foundation of our own Air Force has attracted quite a few Bandits. Their skill and reflexes have helped us in researching newer, more modern and competitive planes."
 MNC_air_4:0 "Flying Raiders"
 MNC_air_4_desc:0 "While previously we would strike the enemy without transports and raid their outposts and camps, we now possess the technology and ability to strike them from the air; a dream come true!"
 MNC_air_5:0 "Wings of Steel"
 MNC_air_5_desc:0 "Our experiments and development of Fighter models has been a great success. However, there might still be room for more, perhaps even heavier armed models."
 MNC_air_6:0 "Falling Stars"
 MNC_air_6_desc:0 "While previously we focused on small scale raiding and bombing, it has become quite clear that strategic bombing could greatly shorten a war by cutting off enemy supply lines and destroying their industry."
 MNC_air_7:0 "Form the Brantbeak Paratrooper Corp"
 MNC_air_7_desc:0 "With a sizeable Air Force now in place, it would be feasible for us to create our own, first Paratrooper corps, with which we could harass and surprise enemies."
 MNC_air_8:0 "Aerial Raiders"
 MNC_air_8_desc:0 "The Skies naturally belong to the griffons, everyone of us knows this by heart. This modern age might have changed the form of aerial combat and flight, but griffons are nonetheless born to fly!"
 MNC_navy_1:0 "The Open Sea"
 MNC_navy_1_desc:0 "Despite our humble beginnings as a deeply landlocked nation, we have at last reached the coast and acquired access to the sea. We mustn't waste time and start production on our own navy, right away."
 MNC_navy_2:0 "A Coastal Fleet"
 MNC_navy_2_desc:0 "As a new and very humble naval power, it would be more than silly to dream of a grand fleet to dominate the high seas. Controlling our coast and harassing enemy supply routes is already an important, vital task."
 MNC_navy_3:0 "Floating Fortresses"
 MNC_navy_3_desc:0 "What is a navy without its own capital ships? We might be new to shipbuilding, but this is no excuse to dismiss our possible naval strength."
 MNC_navy_4:0 "High Sea Escorts"
 MNC_navy_4_desc:0 "To protect our convoys and larger vessels, we require modern escort vessels, such as cruisers and destroyers. This will keep our supply lines and ships safe from sneak attacks."
 MNC_navy_5:0 "The Unseen Fleet"
 MNC_navy_5_desc:0 "A perfect predator against capital ships and convoys, submarines are the ideal weapon for us to use. The enemy won't know what hit them!"
 MNC_navy_6:0 "Battlecruisers"
 MNC_navy_6_desc:0 "Still possessing many of the light cruiser's characteristics, battlecruisers are more heavily armed and armoured, and pose quite a threat to any ship that might encounter them."
 MNC_navy_7:0 "Destroy the Opposition"
 MNC_navy_7_desc:0 "Despite being so small, Destroyers are easy to build, fast, nimble and quite heavily armed for their size. With a few torpedo and artillery hits, even the biggest of behemoths will sink before us."
 MNC_navy_8:0 "Steel Waves"
 MNC_navy_8_desc:0 "To maintain prominence at Sea, we must constantly progress and research new models for our ships. Every new gun system, propulsion or rudder could give us the deciding edge in battle over our foes."

You look outside and see the clear night sky above; the bright Moon and its surrounding stars. Your vision suddenly becomes fussy. You want to lift a claw and wipe your eyes but don't have the strength to move a muscle. Your body becomes numb, and you fall to the ground as everything around you becomes a blur."
 mountain.2.a:0 "..."
 
 mountain.3.t:0 "Whispers in the Dark"
 mountain.3.d:0 "I know your pain, child. I know how it feels to rule but not feel adored. I, he who rules over life and death both, am not beloved. But you, my dear friend, you must understand. Your people lie to you, steal from you, would betray you at a moment's notice. Is this what you call Loyalty?\n\nI can show you true Greatness, young one. Your people must know the price of disobedience and disloyalty. They will either bow before you or crawl in the mud. They will praise my name or choke on their own words. We are allies, you and I. Lead your people to me, to Greatness. Serve me well and you shall reap the rewards of your hard work."
 mountain.3.a:0 "I shall serve."
 mountain.3.b:0 "Get out of my head!"

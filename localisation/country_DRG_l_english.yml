 DRG_loyalty_to_the_dragon_lord_desc:0 "Following recent events, our new Dragon lord Ember has shown us that she deserves to lead us. We shall follow her lead, wherever it might take us!"
 DRG_harmony_with_dragon_characteristics:0 "Harmony with Dragon characteristics"

 DRG_build_new_caves:0 "Build new caves"
 DRG_build_new_caves_desc:0 "If we make it a common effort to create more homes for dragons everywhere, no dragon will ever have to rest uneasy. As much as it might hurt some of us, together we are stronger!"

 DRG_dragons_must_work_desc:0 "Despite our natural strength, some... well, many, actually, seem to find basic work unworthy of their time. This must stop as soon as possible, as we cannot allow dragons to sit idle while others do the work for them."
 DRG_teach_them_to_read:0 "Reading? What's that?"
 DRG_teach_them_to_read_desc:0 "Sadly, almost all dragons appear to lack basic literacy, not even being able to read the most simple of words. This has lead to problems in the past, and will undoubtedly lead to more problems and deficiencies in the future, so we must take action!"
 DRG_support_the_fight:0 "Support the Fight"
 DRG_support_the_fight_desc:0 "A soldier is only as good as the weapon he carries. We dragons sometimes forget that not everycreature is as strong and durable as us by nature. With a larger, more diverse industry, we can make sure to support the good fight, no matter what."
 DRG_dragons_make_the_best_swords:0 "The Fires of Industry"

 DRG_all_dragons_like_a_good_fight_desc:0 "When facing the realities, one thing is for sure: All dragons, no matter how young or tall, love to get into fights.

 DRG_remain_neutral:0 "Proclaim Neutrality"
 DRG_remain_neutral_desc:0 "Dragons never had to bother with anyone from the mainland before, and even still we don't require any of their help or meddling in our affairs. Let it be known to the world that we are neutral, and that our own safety stands above all."
 DRG_embrace_traditions:0 "Embrace Traditions"

 DRG_fortify_the_shore:0 "Fortify the Shore"

 DRG_harmony_alone_desc:0 "No matter what ponies might say, us dragons live in our own world of harmony, far away from the pony one. Our islands are a true bastion, and we stand alone to defend our way of life, no matter the cost!"
 DRG_go_with_equestria:0 "Align with the Ponies"

 DRG_school_of_friendship:0 "The School of Friendship"
 DRG_school_of_friendship_desc:0 "Built after the equestrian predecessor, the Dragon School of Friendship shall henceforth teach our young dragons about the importance of friendship, love and tolerance. The seeds of harmony must be planted in our youth, the most valuable of all generations."

 DRG_dawn_of_a_new_age_desc:0 "For millenia, dragons have lived in small tribal groups, rivaled to one another. These days are over now, and we must aim to modernise and reform our society and industry if we are to survive in this world."
 DRG_melt_rocks_for_roads:0 "The First Roads"
 DRG_melt_rocks_for_roads_desc:0 "It seems logical at first that dragons never had to rely on roads. After all, we can fly! However, in order to transport greater amounts of goods, we simply must travely on land, which is much easier if there are roads to travel on."
 DRG_open_up_the_hoards:0 "Share Dragon treasures"
 DRG_open_up_the_hoards_desc:0 "It has long been a sign of great strength if a dragon could hoard as much wealth for himself as possible. Unfortunately, many of these personal treasures are indeed valuable to us as a society, and they would be much better used for the greater good."

 DRG_make_our_own_hoards:0 "Our own Treasury"
 DRG_make_our_own_hoards_desc:0 "While hoarding can cause a great deficiency, it can also ensure that valuable resources and assets for the greater good are kept in our control. That way, no one can possibly steal it from us and take it for themselves."

 #Military

 DRG_new_ways_to_fight:0 "Warriors of the New Age"
 DRG_new_ways_to_fight_desc:0 "The world has come a long way, and it is ever changing and progressing. We, too, must adapt. We can no longer solely rely on our strength and agility, we too must advance our tactics and weaponry."
 DRG_we_need_guns:0 "A Modern Rifle"
 DRG_we_need_guns_desc:0 "What a modern army needs is good, reliable and modern equipment. We are already desperately outgunned, and so we must do our best to catch up in terms of equipment. A new, modern rifle would be a good first step in the right direction."
 DRG_develop_bigger_guns:0 "Even Bigger Guns"
 DRG_develop_bigger_guns_desc:0 "What better way to embrace the modern age than develop even larger guns than we already have?"
 DRG_fight_like_dragons:0 "Fight Like Dragons"
 DRG_fight_like_dragons_desc:0 "To upkeep our warrior culture and tradition, we must enhance and further develop our tactics, in order to adapt to the new rules of war. Only then will we stand a true chance on the battlefield."
 DRG_traditional_ways:0 "Warrior Traditions"
 DRG_traditional_ways_desc:0 "Our traditions are sacred to most dragons, and one of those traditions is that a dragon must show courage and strength in the face of his enemy. Even now, this tradition must not be forgotten."
 DRG_fighters:0 "Fighters"
 DRG_fighters_desc:0 "Despite our natural ability to fly, we are simply unable to compete with new, modern aircraft. Perhaps it is time to start our own modern air force?"
 DRG_dragons_rule_the_sky:0 "Terror of the Sky"
 DRG_dragons_rule_the_sky_desc:0 "Dragons shall rule and terrorise the skies! But before they can do so, we must properly train and educate our aspiring pilots on how to actually fly and use their new aircraft."
 DRG_death_from_above:0 "Death from Above"
 DRG_death_from_above_desc:0 "A truly horrifying sight to anyone below will be our new, upcoming airborne divisions, capable of landing and infiltrating lands of the enemy that lie far behind the frontline."

 DRG_science_is_cool_desc:0 "With the knowledge we have gained, and the progress we have made in reforming our society into a more modern one, we can now afford to implement a true education system!"
 DRG_bombers:0 "Bombers"
 DRG_bombers_desc:0 "Along with a new vehicle that allows fast flight comes a new variation of it, a heavier, sturdier design that allows it to bombard enemy positions and cities. Without a doubt, this would be a fantastic replacement for what dragons have done for ages: scorching cities!"
 DRG_defend_our_islands:0 "Defend our Islands"
 DRG_defend_our_islands_desc:0 "If our islands, our homeland, comes under attack, then the enemy will without a doubt attempt to cross the sea to get to us. Our newly found progress in aviation technology enables us to stop such thing, however, and new airplane models will blast them out of the water before they can even reach the beaches."
 DRG_sea_dragons:0 "Naval Concerns"
 DRG_sea_dragons_desc:0 "Until this very day, dragons have shied away from water, more specifically the oceans. Due to our ability to fly, plus our ability to breathe fire, it always seemed unnecessary to bind ourselves to maritime trade and warfare. To keep our islands safe, however, we must face the reality. We must construct our own navy!"
 DRG_here_be_dragons:0 "The Island Fortress"
 DRG_here_be_dragons_desc:0 "Our homeland, protected and surrounded by the sea, shall be an impenetrable wall for any attacker to assault. Whatever may come, we will hold!"
 DRG_build_docks:0 "New Dockyards"
 DRG_build_docks_desc:0 "Logically, a navy requires ships, and ships require dockyards in order to build them. Dockyards that we sadly do not have, at the moment. We must change this, at once."
 DRG_sea_serpents:0 "Serpents of the Sea"
 DRG_sea_serpents_desc:0 "Like snakes, our new underwater fleet shall sneak up to our foes and ambush them when they least expect it. Their wrecks will be below the waterline before they even know what happened."
 DRG_dragon_ships:0 "A Surface Fleet"
 DRG_dragon_ships_desc:0 "We lack the production capabilities to construct any large capital ships, and so we must start out small by constructing escort vessels. They may not be very powerful alone, but are maneuverable and powerful in groups."
 DRG_bigger_ships:0 "Our first cruisers"
 DRG_bigger_ships_desc:0 "Adding a few cruisers to our small fleet would help it a lot in fighting other, larger fleets."
 
 ### Events ###
 dragon.1.t:0 "Equestria Claims the Badlands"
 dragon.1.d:0 "Princess Celestia has today announced the Equestrian claim on the territory of the Badlands. The territory was once part of the nation, but has since been inhabited mostly by dragons who raided pony villages, causing said ponies to flee the area.\n\nCelestia has not cited any repercussions should we refuse to cede the territory to them, but it could be wise to do so, either way, in order to avoid possible conflict."
 dragon.1.a:0 "They can have it, it was worthless anyway."
 dragon.1.b:0 "They want our land? Ha!"
 
 dragon.2.t:0 "An Badlands Ultimatum"
 dragon.2.d:0 "Equestria's time and Celestia's patience appears to have run out, and we have received a formal ultimatum that asks us to turn over the badlands to Equestria or 'face the consequences'.\n\nNeedless to say, the Badlands aren't exactly a wealthy piece of land. Quite the contrary, in fact. However, fellow dragons could see us as weak should be bow before Equestria and their demands."
 dragon.2.a:0 "Fine. They can have that usless bit of sand."
 dragon.2.b:0 "How dare they threaten a dragon!"

 dragon.3.t:0 "The Badlands Compromise"
 dragon.3.d:0 "A small delegation from the Dragonlands has reached us, aiming to settle the dispute over the small territory of the Badlands, which is still occupied by the dragons as we speak. The territory was once inhabited by ponies, though they were forced to flee as dragons continued to raid and ravage their villages.\n\nThe Dragons aim to strike a deal with us about the return of the territory. As part of the deal, we would invest in the industrial development of the small island tribe while they immediately return the piece of land to us."
 dragon.3.a:0 "We agree to these terms."

 dragon.4.t:0 "The Badlands Compromise"
 dragon.4.d:0 "Our delegation has returned from Equestria, and with good news, too! Equestria has agreed to our terms and accepted our proposal."
 dragon.4.a:0 "Diplomacy does work, after all!"

 klugetown.1.t:0 "A Modest Proposal"
 klugetown.1.d:0 "Verko sat in his office, puffing a cigar. It was a very nice office, really. Redwood from the Changeling coast tiling the floor, with luxurious Colthagian leather upholstering his chair. And his desk did a fine job of both holding papers and providing the suitably imposing atmosphere befitting the leader of Klugetown.\n\nMost immediately interesting, however, was the paper currently on the desk. In short, it was a proposal asking to repeal the only racial discrimination law remaining: namely, a decree instituted by his predecessor that banned changelings and umbrum from entering. The paper detailed the possible benefits of having changelings present, such as a team of natural spies and assasssins, as well as the incredible theatre that could be put on with changeling actors. As for the changeling need for love, it could be resolved through feeding on debtors as a form of payment, at standard exchange rates of course.\n\nFor Umbrum, none had been seen but Sombra, who was currently banished, so why worry?"
 klugetown.1.a:0 "Approved, Klugetown welcomes everyone."
 klugetown.1.b:0 "Too risky."

 # IDEAS #
 KLG_skydocks:0 "The Skydocks of Klugetown"
 KLG_skydocks_desc:0 "Airships continually arrive and depart Klugetown, bringing goods and passengers across Zebrica. Naturally, this makes trade easy and lucrative, though it does also open up plentiful opportunies for smuggling—something which bothers Klugetown not at all."
 KLG_black_market:0 "The Black Market of the White Sands"
 KLG_black_market_desc:0 "In Klugetown, anything can be bought for the right price. From exotic drugs to hardened mercenaries, from debt-slaves to forged papers, Klugetown offers services most other nations deem immoral if not outright illegal."
 KLG_mafia_rule:0 "The Mafia in Charge"
 KLG_mafia_rule_desc:0 "Organized crime has completely supplanted the normal state, to the point that unhappy citizens turn to the crime bosses for recourse. Their rule has kept Klugetown stable for decades, and they don't take kindly to conquerors seizing their land."

 # LEADERS #
 POLITICS_VERKO_DESC:0 "A clever criminal and entrepreneur who has ruled Klugetown for over 20 years, Verko kept Klugetown in business even during the Storm King's rule. With a strict code of honor and a talent for bargaining, Verko is widely respected and feared. As a client state to the Storm King Klugetown prospered, and even following an unfortunate run-in with Tempest Shadow he held onto power. One thing's for sure: Klugetown will stay open, no matter what!"
 POLITICS_GRUMM_DESC:0 ""So ya wanna hear about Grumm, pal? Well, the story goes like this. Young Dragon whelp lookin' for a quick profit makes his way down to Zebrica and runs right into the Storm King. Storm King's got a mind for profit too, and a nice big army to boot. Lil' Grumm can see a beautiful friendship forming, and signs on as a logistics officer--turns out food arrives a lot faster when the courier can be food too! He sets up the most exclusive bazaar in Klugetown with a cut of the supplies, and both he and the Storm King are rolling in frags. After the Storm King gets himself killed, Grumm just keeps the money mill going. Now with Verko outta the way and Capper put in his place, I run this town. And ya best mind your manners, cause I intend to turn this dump into the richest town in the world, and it don't matter who has to bleed to get there.""
 POLITICS_CAPPER_DESC:0 "Capper has spent most of his life on the run. Growing up an orphan, he had to steal to eat. He wound up a low-level concat in Verko's employ. After meeting the Elements of Harmony, Capper reformed, and now pushes for a free Klugetown that can serve as a haven to the oppressed or persecuted, where freedom and Harmony are loved in equal measure—a Kása of the South."

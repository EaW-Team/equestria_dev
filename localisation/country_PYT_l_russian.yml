### Ideas ###
PYT_the_peasant_republic:0 "The Peasant Republic"
PYT_the_peasant_republic_desc:0 "The Republic of Peasants was founded in 720 ALB after the peasantry rose up against Duke Erebus Blacktalon - one of Grover I's many early political opponents. The Emperor rewarded the peasantry by allowing them to organise their own government.\n\n Thus Greifenmarschen was created, a peculiar nation even by Griffonian standards. It can safely be called the first Republic on the continent, but it can also be considered the most flawed Republic on the continent.\n\n Operating on the principles of total equality and liberty for all of its citizens, quite literally every single minor thing in Greifenmarschen is voted on, and while this system evokes an unmatched sense of loyalty to the Republic it also means that implemeting any sort of reforms will be nigh impossible."
PYT_the_peasant_army:0 "The Bauernmiliz"
PYT_the_peasant_army_desc:0 "Greifenmarschen's Army or rather the Bauernmiliz suffers from many of the same issues that its government does. Officers and plans are voted upon, any sense of discipline is nonexistent, and any reforms are hard to pass.\n\n On the bright side there is no shortage of eager recruits ready and willing to defend their beloved Republic."
PYT_rural_economy:0 "Ruralism"
PYT_rural_economy_desc:0 "The nature of Greifenmarschen's government and people has made it rather hard to create any proper industrial centers, as such most of our economy is reliant on farming and mining."

### Focuses ###
PYT_initial_army_reforms:0 "Reforming the Bauernmiliz"
PYT_initial_army_reforms_desc:0 "For decades now the army of the Republic has remained untouched, becoming increasingly outdated in this age of innovation and revolution. Our faction has finally managed to gather enough supporters who will approve any proposals we might make, but it remains to be decided how exactly the army will be reformed."
PYT_militia_roots:0 "Perfect As Is"
PYT_militia_roots_desc:0 "Our peasant militias have bravely and reliably defended the country from foreign incursions for centuries now, holding the river banks and crushing any noble fool who tried to subdue us. Why change the wheels of a working wagon?"
PYT_call_to_arms:0 "A Call to Arms"
PYT_call_to_arms_desc:0 "The Bauernmiliz is a purely voluntary force, but that fact does not mean that we can not ask our citizens to volunteer. There are surely thousands of willing griffons ready to fight for their country, we need only to put out the word."
PYT_actual_conscription:0 "Fight For Your Home"
PYT_actual_conscription_desc:0 "While the Bauernmiliz may not be as professional a force compared to the other militaries of Griffonia, they do possess their own distinct advantage. They will fight for their homes, their families and their country. And, if nessicary, they will die for their homes."
PYT_guerilla_warfare:0 "From the Shadows"
PYT_guerilla_warfare_desc:0 "The Bauernmiliz is not only consigned to our official divisions but rather is comprised of thousands of small cells operating out of our territory. Regardless of our defeat on the battlefield, the Bauernmiliz will continue the fight behind enemy lines, striking from the shadows until they can be liberated by our forces."
PYT_actual_guns:0 "The Right Tools"
PYT_actual_guns_desc:0 "If the Bauernmiliz are to fight on the battlefield, they will need the right tools for the job. There are thousands of citizens who hold surplus weapons and tools, and many would gladly donate them to the Bauernmiliz."
PYT_train_our_troops:0 "Proper Training"
PYT_train_our_troops_desc:0 "By accelerating and streamlining our training regimen we can ensure that the next batch of recruits reaches the front faster and better trained."
PYT_born_of_the_land:0 "Born of the Land"
PYT_born_of_the_land_desc:0 "Our soldiers all have an incredible amount of experience with the land and terrain of our homeland, acquired through generations working and developing the land. We can gather these techniques together to ensure that our forces can subsist in even the harshest conditions."
PYT_stock_the_villages:0 "Stock the Villages"
PYT_stock_the_villages_desc:0 "We must be ready for conflict, and many of our villages are perfect spots for storing equipment for use in emergencies. We can also encourage local production of weapons to further increase our self-sufficiency."
PYT_slight_reforms:0 "The Volkssturm"
PYT_slight_reforms_desc:0 "The methods of the Bauernmiliz have been perfected through our advancements, and it has truly transformed. It is now a true army of the people. The Volkssturm stands ready to fight, and if necessary, die for their homes. Wahr di, Garr, de Buer de kumt!"
PYT_modern_guns:0 "Modern Rifles"
PYT_modern_guns_desc:0 "Due to the lack of the standardization of equipment amongst our forces, many of our soldiers are stuck with woefully out of date rifles. This is not currently a problem, but if we were ever to engage in combat with another nation, our soldiers would quickly be outmatched by their superior equipment. We must invest in designing and researching new rifles to solve this dilemma."
PYT_modern_artillery:0 "Artillery Implementation"
PYT_modern_artillery_desc:0 "Artillery remains a rare sight amongst our forces, with many units of the Bauernmiliz reluctant to adopt them due to a reliance on tradition and an aversion to change. But the prospect of artillery shattering our enemies before a grand attack by the infantry is too enticing to ignore. Artillery is the future, we only need to develop our own models before implementation can begin."
PYT_support_troops:0 "Support Squads"
PYT_support_troops_desc:0 "While most of the volunteers for the Bauernmiliz are excited to fight for their country on the frontlines, there is a distinct lack of support units amongst our forces. While not as exciting as the frontline roles, support roles are equally as vital to the war effort. We shall expand and develop these support units, thus creating a strong support structure for our army."
PYT_radio_implementation:0 "Radio Implementation"
PYT_radio_implementation_desc:0 "The prospective military uses of the radio are practically infinite. With better communication, we can overhaul and streamline our entire command structure. If we can develop our own radio models we can proceed with these ambitious plans."
PYT_motorization:0 "Motorisation"
PYT_motorization_desc:0 "Very few griffons in Greifenmarschen own, or would even recognize a car. But with the existing overhauls of our army in place, we can finally start to motorize our army. Motorized forces have the potential to outperform regular infantry in most aspects, to ignore such an advancement in technology would be folly of the highest order."
PYT_professionalism:0 "Strictly Professional"
PYT_professionalism_desc:0 "It is time for change at last. We are surrounded by nations fielding drilled armies of full-time soldiers. If we are to retain our independence and liberty, we must adapt and modernize our army."
PYT_implement_army_drills:0 "Standardized Equipment"
PYT_implement_army_drills_desc:0 "The Bauernmiliz has no real concept of a standardized piece of equipment, or doctrine for that matter. In the past our soldiers have simply used what was available at the time, and it has worked adequately for our needs in the past. But if we are to drag the Bauernmiliz kicking and screaming into modernity, we will have to establish some sort of standardization amongst our equipment."
PYT_armouries:0 "Proper Armouries"
PYT_armouries_desc:0 "The logistical system of the Bauernmiliz is a nightmare for all involved. Few griffons even know where the majority of the reserve arms are stored, with thousands of small villages having their own set of rifles hidden away in some compartment or another. This insanity must be stopped, we shall gather all of our arms and place them in properly secured and documented facilities."
PYT_instill_discipline:0 "A Sense of Discipline"
PYT_instill_discipline_desc:0 "If the Bauernmiliz is to face our enemies on the battlefield, they must be utterly unshakable from their duties. If the officers tell them to charge, they must charge. And if the officers tell them to retreat, they must retreat. Such a sense of discipline is currently lacking in our forces but through an intense training program, we can make sure that every single soldier will do his duty when the time comes."
PYT_an_actual_officer_core:0 "A New Officer Core"
PYT_an_actual_officer_core_desc:0 "While the current system of allowing soldiers to elect their officers makes for happy soldiers, it does not make good officers. We must fix this if we are ever to fight in a real war. Our current officers will be tested, those who prove themselves will stay, while those who do not will be demoted. After this, we will ensure that officers will be promoted by merit, thus solving this problem for good."
PYT_the_peoples_army:0 "The Volksarmee"
PYT_the_peoples_army_desc:0 "After an immense amount of reforms and changes, the Bauernmiliz has been transformed into a professional force. Our soldiers stand ready and able to fight with absolute discipline no matter the situation, and our officers now show an air of authority. The title of Bauernmiliz no longer fits our well trained army. Henceforth, it shall be known as the Volksarmee, a proper title for a proper army."
PYT_implement_conscription:0 "Implement Conscription"
PYT_implement_conscription_desc:0 "Conscription is a controversial topic within Griefenmarschen, as membership in the Bauernmiliz has traditionally been a purely voluntary endeavor. But the fact of the matter is that we are already outgunned and outmanned by our potential enemies. Whatever the public may feel about conscription, it is a necessary evil if we are to protect ourselves."
PYT_streamlined_training:0 "Streamlined Training"
PYT_streamlined_training_desc:0 "Currently, basic training in the Bauernmiliz is heavily based on what unit of the militia you join. Many units have unique methods of putting recruits through basic training, causing the average time it takes for a soldier to get ready for combat to vary wildly. To fix this problem, we shall study the methods of the most efficient units and implement them as standard practice across the entire Bauernmiliz."
PYT_auxiliary_roles:0 "Auxiliary Military Roles"
PYT_auxiliary_roles_desc:0 "While frontline fighters may be the most famous amongst our armed forces, they are not by any means the only ones. To truly create an effective fighting force, various support units are necessary to enable the soldiers to fight at their peak capacity. Logistics, maintenance and more are crucial to maintaining a highly effective fighting force, it would be wise to establish such support for the Bauernmiliz."

PYT_the_economy:0 "A New Economy For a New Age"
PYT_the_economy_desc:0 "The new millenium has dawned and with it economic revolution. Farmers abroad use new tools which require less labour, leaving those without work to move to cities. So far we have avoided such change, but our economy is becoming dangerously uncompetitive. Now that our faction has enough popular support, our proposals will be approved by the referendums. It is time to decide how to reform our economy."
PYT_agrarianism:0 "Stick to the Classics"
PYT_agrarianism_desc:0 "Ruralism and agrarianism are defining aspects of our country. Changing these would require changing what we are. We must remain true to ourselves and focus on reforming agriculture, which is the foundation of our existence."
PYT_connect_countryside:0 "Connect the Countryside"
PYT_connect_countryside_desc:0 "Unlike in cities, in rural areas everything is far apart. If we wish for our populace to have easy access to services such as schools, hospices, temples and markets, we must improve our dirt paths into proper paved roads."
PYT_support_local_business:0 "Support Local Businesses"
PYT_support_local_business_desc:0 "Instead of focusing on markets and companies in Oldwingburg, we should aid small businesses in our villages and towns who serve the locals and provide them what they need. This means griffons will be less inclined to move to cities and will instead remain on their farms."
PYT_foreign_experts:0 "Public Works Projects"
PYT_foreign_experts_desc:0 "To reduce unemployment and to increase the availability of services in rural areas, we will begin public works projects intended to build schools, hospitals, wells, sewers and bridges in the underdeveloped countryside. The funding will come entirely from the pockets of the government, instead those of urban entrepreneurs who only care about urban areas."
PYT_initial_modernisation_efforts:0 "Into the Modern Age"
PYT_initial_modernisation_efforts_desc:0 "Now that we have laid the foundations, we can begin to modernize our agrarian country, without necessarily urbanizing it. We will adopt new technologies from abroad, reform education and pass new laws, ultimately proving to the world that modernity does not require sacrificing tradition and identity!"
PYT_distribute_land:0 "Work the Land"
PYT_distribute_land_desc:0 "For decades now griffons have been abandoning farms and moving to towns and cities such as Oldwingburg in search of a living. It is time for this trend to be reversed! The countryside, now having proper infrastructure, shall be repopulated and abandoned land will be reclaimed."
PYT_subsidise_agrculture:0 "Subsidise the Farmers"
PYT_subsidise_agrculture_desc:0 "Instead of supporting the merchants and artisans in urban areas, the government should aid the farmers, especially after poor harvests. With this we will not only ensure further development of the countryside but also receive support from grateful farmers."
PYT_mechanise_agriculture:0 "Agricultural Mechanisation"
PYT_mechanise_agriculture_desc:0 "Our agricultural sector cannot compete with foreign noble estates because of our low and decentralized production. To deal with the issue, we should mechanize our agriculture which will greatly increase production and make the farmers' lives easier."
PYT_finished_reforms:0 "A Green Society"
PYT_finished_reforms_desc:0 "After a series of reforms proposed by our faction, Greifenmarschen has changed while remaining the same. Agriculture is still vital for our economy, society and culture, but it has been modernized and the lives of farmers have greatly improved. With Eyr's blessing, may the Peasants' Republic last forever!"
PYT_mining_techniques:0 "Modern Mining Tools"
PYT_mining_techniques_desc:0 "The earth is the source of most of our wealth. On its surface, we grow our crops, and beneath it we dig and find precious minerals. However, our miners produce little while risking their lives, mostly because of our outdated techniques and tools. We need to import foreign tools and invite foreign experts to revolutionize our mining operations."
PYT_thurwingen_mining:0 "Thurwingian Mines"
PYT_thurwingen_mining_desc:0 "A while ago farmers in Thurwingen claimed they struck rich veins of shining metal while tilling their soil. It is time for us to send the foreign experts we invited to prospect the region and evaluate the size of the deposits. If they are large enough, we will put our new tools to use!"
PYT_oil_wells:0 "Oil In Nortfome"
PYT_oil_wells_desc:0 "Shortly after mining operations in Thurwingen began, miners discovered pockets of crude oil underground. Our foreign experts have conducted seismic surveys and estimated that the oil deposits are part of a much larger reservoir which extends to Nortfome as well and is ultimately part of the massive Adelart petroleum reservoir. We should take advantage of this and fund the construction of oil wells!"
PYT_teach_the_people:0 "Begin the War Against Illiteracy"
PYT_teach_the_people_desc:0 "The stereotype of an uneducated, superstitious and illiterate peasant is unfortunately true for our citizens. If we wish to modernize our nation, we must teach the griffons to read, for it is the foundation for everything modern. Our literacy programs must begin as soon as possible."
PYT_industrialisation:0 "Industrialisation"
PYT_industrialisation_desc:0 "Beyond our borders farmers are abandoning the countryside and moving to urban cities to toil in factories. The workers have better access to services such as education and gain better wages. It is clear that to improve our own lives, we must embrace modernity which we fear so greatly."
PYT_buy_the_land:0 "Buy Out the Farmers"
PYT_buy_the_land_desc:0 "If we wish for our cities to expand, we must acquire the surrounding farmlands. The peasant families have held them for centuries, but all we need to do to persuade them to sell their lands is offer them enough bits."
PYT_oil:0 "Black Gold"
PYT_oil_desc:0 "As surveys were being completed on the land we had recently acquired, we discovered pockets of petroleum underground. This is great news for us, for with oil production industrialization will be much easier and our economy will strengthen. Oil wells must be constructed at once!"
PYT_dig_deeper:0 "Dig Deep and Dig Greedily"
PYT_dig_deeper_desc:0 "Several exploration wells we built have shown that the oil deposits are part of the vast Adelart reservoir, meaning that with slant drilling we can greatly increase our oil production. Griffons in Adelart surely won't mind if we claim our fair share of the treasure."
PYT_synthethic:0 "Synthethic Oil Experiments"
PYT_synthethic_desc:0 "While we have more than enough oil production now, it might be wise to invest in syntethic oil, considering how the oil wells will eventually run dry. It is a long-term investment that will hopefully pay off."
PYT_rapid_industrialisation:0 "The March of Progress"
PYT_rapid_industrialisation_desc:0 "We are far behind neighbouring nations such as Feathisia, Aquileia and the Empire, with our economy largely agrarian. Now that we have enough land, we can rent plots for a low price, construct new factories and subsidise our industrialists so our industry can massively expand. We must take expensive loans but it will ultimately be worthwhile."
PYT_railroad:0 "The Great Greifenmarschen Railroad"
PYT_railroad:0 "The Great Railroad"
PYT_railroad_desc:0 "Our transportation still relies mostly on dirt roads and the only railroad in our country is an old and dilapidated one, built years ago to connect Oldwingburg with Romau. That railroad must be renovated and expanded, its capacity and length greatly increased. Ultimately all railroads in Greifenmarschen shall lead to Oldwingburg, the growing industrial heart of our country."
PYT_arms_industry:0 "Domestic Arms Industry"
PYT_arms_industry_desc:0 "For years now our soldiers have used Imperial armouries and local gunsmiths to arm themselves. If we wish to modernize our army, we have to use standardized weaponry produced exclusively in our efficient factories. Instead of our militiagriffs buying any weapons they wish, our army will acquire exclusvely domestic equipment and give it to our soldiers."
PYT_industrialisation_finish:0 "An Industrial Nation"
PYT_industrialisation_finish_desc:0 "Our reforms are finally bearing fruit and the population of Oldwingburg and other towns is growing rapidly, with the countryside being abandoned. Businesses are booming, new factories open without any aid from us and the wages of factory workers have surpassed those of farmers. We are finally becoming an industrialized, modern nation. May our neighbours no longer mock us for our backwardness!"
PYT_tech_college:0 "The Oldwingburg Institute of Engineering"
PYT_tech_college_desc:0 "If we wish to industrialize our nation, we need experts who can design and create modern machines, and those experts should not be expensive ones hired from abroad. By founding a specialized instituion where engineers can study and work, our country will not lack educated minds which we sorely need."
PYT_societal_advancement:0 "Here and Now"
PYT_societal_advancement_desc:0 "We must take decisive action to modernize our nation. Education will be reformed and made available for free for the masses, and new economic laws should be passed to liberalize our protectionist economy."
PYT_modern_methods:0 "Modern Industrial Methods"
PYT_modern_methods_desc:0 "Now that we have many talented engineers working for us, we can begin a program to implement more efficient production methods. Assembly lines, numerous machines and electric factory lighting shall all herald the beginning of a new age in Greifenmarschen."
PYT_research_slot:0 "State Funded Universities"
PYT_research_slot_desc:0 "Any young griffons in our country who wish to attain a higher education have no option but to move across the river to Yale. Oftentimes they graduate there and move to other countries to work. We must found our own universities and generously fund them so we have enough talented teachers for all the eager students who can now stay in their beloved homeland."

PYT_navy_stuff:0 "Founding a Navy"
PYT_navy_stuff_desc:0 "For the first time in our nation's history we have claimed coastline, the vast and terrifying ocean finally within our sight. Many threats lurk beyond the horizon, and we must prepare for their arrival and build ships of war. The locals will be able to aid us in this effort."
PYT_base_strike_f:0 "Strike at the Heart"
PYT_base_strike_f_desc:0 "The core of our enemies will not always be vulnerable to a direct attack. Often a nations true naval strength lies not directly in its Navy, but in the ports and dockyards which supply and repair it. But through the use of carriers and submarines, we can deliver crippling blows to this critical portion of our foes industry, while protecting our own."
PYT_carrier_f:0 "Carrier Experiments"
PYT_carrier_f_desc:0 "Carriers have the potential to completely revolutionize naval warfare. Through the combined might of the navy and the airforce, almost limitless tactical and strategic possibilities present themselves. But before any of that can be done, we need to actually develop a solid carrier model."
PYT_navy_planes_f:0 "Naval Aviation"
PYT_navy_planes_f_desc:0 "To deal with the unique challenges that come with carrier-based operations, new models and designs of planes must be developed. With each improvement to our carrier-based planes the strategic potential of our carriers increased, we would truly be mad to ignore this avenue of advancement."
PYT_fleet_being_f:0 "A Show of Force"
PYT_fleet_being_f_desc:0 "Our ports are the most critical part of our naval strength, as without them our navy would not last long unsupplied. By constructing a fleet focused on large battleships we can simply intimidate the enemy fleets, forcing them to stay away from our home waters while we build up the navy. And a few battleships certainly wouldn't hurt the national pride either."
PYT_dockyards:0 "A Home Port"
PYT_dockyards_desc:0 "To fuel our newly established naval efforts, a true home port is required. By constructing several new dockyards we can meet the demand for our navy, and provide a new destination for trade to arrive in our nation."
PYT_battlecruiser_f:0 "Bigger Ships"
PYT_battlecruiser_f_desc:0 "In order to stay competitive with the navies of other nations, we must constantly develop and expand our hulls. Bigger is better as they say, and we can certainly go bigger than our current models."
PYT_light_cruiser_f:0 "Light Cruisers"
PYT_light_cruiser_f_desc:0 "In order to meet the ever more stringent demands of our navy, our light cruiser models must be improved. The armor and armaments of our current models can almost certainly be improved, and if we have to break a few naval treaties to accomplish this, so be it."
PYT_battleship_f:0 "Battleships"
PYT_battleship_f_desc:0 "The pride of every nation, building and designing a proper battleship is a truly daunting task. But with the ever-expanding naval capacity of our nation combined with the latest advancements in naval technology have now made this feasible. The time has come to construct a true flagship for our navy."
PYT_expand_dockyards:0 "Dockyard Expansion"
PYT_expand_dockyards_desc:0 "Our ever-expanding navy now devours resources and manpower at a steady rate, and to meet this massive new demand multiple new dockyards will be constructed. A navy cannot exist without dockyards after all."
PYT_marine_f:0 "Create a Marine Core"
PYT_marine_f_desc:0 "The nature of modern war has rendered amphibious operations a necessity. Rather than throwing our normal forces at the beaches untrained and unready for their task, we shall create a new arm of the Navy specifically to deal with these landings, creating soldiers who can truly thrive in an amphibious environment."
PYT_transport_f:0 "Modern Transport Vessels"
PYT_transport_f_desc:0 "As our amphibious operations expand, the demand for new and better-equipped transport vessels does as well. By improving our existing designs we can deliver more soldiers to the battlefield faster and more efficiently than before."
PYT_trade_indirection_f:0 "Striking at the Lifelines"
PYT_trade_indirection_f_desc:0 "Against a truly overwhelming opponent, we cannot risk a direct confrontation. But the latest advancements in submarine technology provide another option. By constructing a large fleet of submarines and through developing new tactics based around these submarines we can simply cut off all trade to our enemies. A massive navy is of little use when there is no oil to fuel it after all."
PYT_destroyer_f:0 "Patrol Boats"
PYT_destroyer_f_desc:0 "Not every task requires the biggest guns in the navy. Patroling the coastline and supporting the larger ships are roles that are much better filled with smaller ships. By leveraging their small size and ease of production our destroyers might be able to punch above their weight class."
PYT_submarine_f:0 "U-Boat Experiments"
PYT_submarine_f_desc:0 "The potential to strike our enemies ships unseen, hunting their fleets across the oceans and waiting for the perfect moment to strike, is truly tantalizing. By conditioning new designs of submarines, we can better realize this potential."

PYT_air_stuff:0 "Flying High"
PYT_air_stuff_desc:0 "Griffons were born to fly, to pierce the sky and enjoy true freedom. But despite the abilities granted by our wings, the limitations of biology have always prevented us from soaring too fast or too high. But with the latest innovations in airframes, we can shatter those limits, and griffonkind will know fewer limits in the sky than ever before."
PYT_fighter_projects:0 "Wings of Steel"
PYT_fighter_projects_desc:0 "Our current airframes are laughably outdated, and our first step in achieving dominance of the sky once more should be to update our fighter models. We have little to be concerned about from enemy planes if our fighters simply rip them to shreds after all."
PYT_doctrinal_development:0 "High Altitude Training"
PYT_doctrinal_development_desc:0 "Despite being more naturally suited to the skies than most species, excessive altitudes can still heavily hamper a griffon pilots capabilities in the field. By training our pilots at these extreme altitudes we can gradually wean them to the massive heights that they will have to endure as professional pilots, granting us a tactical advantage over our enemies."
PYT_actual_air_bases:0 "The Asselt Airfields"
PYT_actual_air_bases_desc:0 "While airplanes were never particularly popular in Greifenmarschen, there was the odd griffon known to own a plane back in the day. A defunct aerodrome now sits in Asselt, and its location makes it perfect to establish a new airfield upon. Our planes are little more than steel deathtraps with no place to land after all."
PYT_strat:0 "Strategic Bomber Effort"
PYT_strat_desc:0 "By striking our enemies critical wartime industries, we can potentially rob them of their abilities to supply their troops in the field with equipment. As the most critical industries are often the most well-guarded ones, a specialized type of bomber will have to be developed to carry and drop the bombs on our enemies industrial centers."
PYT_tact:0 "Tactical Bomber Effort"
PYT_tact_desc:0 "Why fire guns at our enemies from the ground when we can simply blow them up from the sky? By developing new tactical bombers to destroy enemy forces we can significantly damage our enemies divisions before they have a chance to engage with our ground troops."
PYT_napalm:0 "Napalm"
PYT_napalm_desc:0 "Napalm has proven itself to be a particularly useful tool during wartime. Burning at the same temperature as gasoline and for far longer intervals, as well as sticking tenaciously to its targets. This substance is almost perfect for its usage in payloads for our bombers, serving as a perfect weapon to use against structures and infantry."
PYT_CAS_projects:0 "Claws of Iron"
PYT_CAS_projects_desc:0 "Though they may lack the heavier payloads of our tactical bombers, our close air support frames still serve a vital role in our combat operations. By attacking and destroying smaller targets of opportunity during battle, close are support can easily turn the tide of battles if used properly."
PYT_heavy_fighter_projects:0 "Guarding Our Skies"
PYT_heavy_fighter_projects_desc:0 "In order to provide an effective escort for our strategic bombers, a new design of fighter must be developed. Sporting heavier armaments, and being all around heavier and less agile, than a regular fighter, these planes can comfortably escort our bombers. And will provide a  tough foe to all enemy interceptors seeking to destroy our bombers."
PYT_rocket_projects:0 "Rocketry Projects"
PYT_rocket_projects_desc:0 "While many consider them a novelty of warfare, rockets hold immense potential both as a means of propelling our aircraft and as a weapon in and of themselves. Investing in testing sites and new rocket designs is only prudent at this point."
PYT_paratrooper_project:0 "The Screaming Eagles"
PYT_paratrooper_project_desc:0 "Jumping from altitudes that even the bravest griffons would have considered insane only a few years ago, our elite paratroopers can handily land behind enemy lines to cause havoc. And as their equipment gets more sophisticated, their potential strategic and tactical uses increase as well."
PYT_expanded_bases:0 "Expand the Asselt Air Fields"
PYT_expanded_bases_desc:0 "To meet the demands of our expanding airforce, and to provide the nessicary capacity for further expansion, the already sizable airfields at Asselt must be expanded once more."
PYT_jet_fighters:0 "The V-1 Jet Fighter"
PYT_jet_fighters_desc:0 "After multiple prototypes and false-starts, the first ever viable model for a jet-powered fighter produced by our designers approaches. With even more investment we can enter into a new age of aviation, flying planes at speeds that would make the common griffon speechless."

PYT_the_national_republic:0 "The National Republic"
PYT_the_national_republic_desc:0 "Dietrich Mach and his deputy Wilke Truthahn, figureheads of the fascist NAP faction, have successfully seized power in Greifenmarschen. The Council has been disbanded after its members were forced to swear loyalty to the new rulers of the country. Now Dietrich and Wilke can finally pass reforms they've desired for so long."
PYT_mobilise_the_people:0 "Mobilise the People"
PYT_mobilise_the_people_desc:0 "Every griffon in Greifenmarschen is a citizen and every citizen is a soldier. Yet only few are in active duty as participation in the Bauernmiliz is mostly voluntary. This must change at once! Our proud peasants must take up arms and prepare to fight filthy aristocrat pigs lurking beyond the border!"
PYT_the_partys_army:0 "Officialise the Bohngarde"
PYT_the_partys_army_desc:0 "The Bohngarde, the unofficial paramilitary wing of NAP named after Edwin Bohn, the founder of the faction, has served us well for many years. It is time we reward them for their loyalty by turning them into the official state police of Greifenmarschen, responsible for ensuring internal security and guarding the lives of NAP members."
PYT_loyalty_officers:0 "Bohngarde Loyalty Officers"
PYT_loyalty_officers_desc:0 "To ensure our militiagriffs remain absolutely loyal to their beloved fatherland, we will integrate the Bohngarde with the Bauernmiliz. Officers will ensure national fervour in the ranks and punish those who wish to betray us all."
PYT_hey_slovaci:0 "Loyalität zum Vaterland!"
PYT_hey_slovaci_desc:0 "Dietrich Mach has commissioned a talented musician from Nortfome to write an official anthem for Greifenmarschen, which so far has lacked one. The song will be called 'Loyalität zum Vaterland!', its lyrics will be written in Herzlandish and it will be imbued with nationalist and militarist themes, saying how Greifenmarschen will always stand firm and proud above the despots of the world."
PYT_reinforce_power:0 "Consolidate Our Grip"
PYT_reinforce_power_desc:0 "If we are to strike at the heart of the Empire and liberate Herzland, we must be united and strong. Those who wish to weaken and divide us from within will be taken care of and our corrupt democratic institutions will be reformed. Hesitation in Greifenmarschen will die and be replaced by glorious determination!"
PYT_control_knowledge:0 "Control Knowledge"
PYT_control_knowledge_desc:0 "To guard our country from within, we must seize the printing presses and nationalize them. Nothing shall be printed without explicit permission and approval from NAP. Book burnings shall also be organized across the country as we must cleanse Greifenmarschen from corrupt, degenerate and weak ideas spread by foreign aristocrats."
PYT_control_the_people:0 "Totalitarian Democracy"
PYT_control_the_people_desc:0 "For almost two centuries have the people held power in Greifenmarschen. As such, they are resistant to the idea of NAP leaders remaining in control and deciding everything. Internal dissent must not divide us ever again, but perhaps we can let them vote after all. The results of referendums will require approval from Dietrich and voting will be closely monitored by the Bohngarde."
PYT_remove_truthahn:0 "Dispose of Truthahn"
PYT_remove_truthahn_desc:0 "Deputy Wilke Truthahn has long seen Dietrich as an upstart rival, and now that NAP is in power the cooperation between the two has completely collapsed, with daily arguments and constant disagreements. The old loonie is now nothing more but a thorn on our side. Dietrich's patience has ran out and he now plans to ask Wilke to resign. With most of NAP loyal to him, it would be unwise for Wilke to say no."
PYT_staff_the_council:0 "Staff the Council"
PYT_staff_the_council_desc:0 "The Council was an integral institution of Greifenmarschen that had been disbanded during the coup. Now Dietrich is finally prepared to reinstate it like he had promised, but with many changes. Mostly that it would be little more than a puppet government filled with NAP loyalists, its members saying yes to anything Dietrich proposes."
PYT_control_the_government:0 "Outlaw 'Disloyal' Factions"
PYT_control_the_government_desc:0 "GKVP, KPG and GVHP are nothing more than bands of traitors and pacifist cowards. Their leaders have already sworn undying loyalty to NAP, but can they be trusted? And the regular members have sworn no oaths at all. It is clear these illegal gangs should be disbanded and their leaders arrested, for they are nothing more than tumours."
PYT_mobilise_the_economy:0 "Mobilise the Economy"
PYT_mobilise_the_economy_desc:0 "Preparations must begin for the grand unification campaigns. The underdeveloped economy of Greifenmarschen needs to be able to support a massive war effort! We must greatly increase our military expenditure, draft workers and confiscate resources needed by our army."
PYT_corporate_economy:0 "Implement Corporatism"
PYT_corporate_economy_desc:0 "The economy won't become strong on its own. The guiding claw of state-owned corporations, all managing different sectors, will ensure planned and quick growth. In addition corporatism can be used to reduce opposition to our rule and reward those loyal to us."
PYT_industry_grows:0 "Industrial Grants"
PYT_industry_grows_desc:0 "Money will be printed en masse, then used to fund the construction of new factories and to support our corporations. Debts will be taken care of once we loot the countless noble manors in Herzland."
PYT_agricultural_support:0 "Blood and Soil"
PYT_agricultural_support_desc:0 "While industrialization is necessary for the liberation war, we cannot forget the peasants of the countryside who are true Greifenmarsians and the foundation of our nation. Rural values are bound to our blood! We should grant farmland to the unemployed urban workers and generously aid farmers with a state-owned fund, the Bauernfond."
PYT_the_road_to_herzland:0 "In die Bresche!"
PYT_the_road_to_herzland_desc:0 "For too long has Herzland been divided between fat aristocrat pigs and weakened by tyranny. It was time at last to liberate all Herzlanders and unite them under one banner! The noble scum and the unreliable Archons will all receive their punishments for oppressing the people for generations. Onwards, brave Greifenmarsians! To death and glorious victory!"

PYT_the_peoples_republic:0 "The Revolutionary Republic"
PYT_the_peoples_republic_desc:0 "Wingbert Rohmer, figurehead of the communist KPG faction, has successfully seized power in Greifenmarschen. The Council has been disbanded after its members were arrested and accused of betraying the griffons who had voted for them. Now Wingbert can finally pass reforms he has desired for so long."
PYT_red_army:0 "The Greifenmarschen Red Army"
PYT_red_army_desc:0 "The dark threat of the evil Empire looms threateningly over us all. We must prepare our griffons to fight for their freedom, to the death if need be! Our military must be reformed, and no longer will capitalists and fascists stand in our way. Bauernmiliz shall become a proper army of the proletariat!"
PYT_red_commandos:0 "Revolutionäre Expeditionsabteilung"
PYT_red_commandos_desc:0 "We cannot deny that we are few in number, while our enemies are numerous. Without quantity, we must focus on quality. A special expeditionary division will be formed, consisting of the most skilled and loyal soldiers of KPG. Our finest officers shall lead them to victory!"
PYT_loyal_officers:0 "Fresh Blood"
PYT_loyal_officers_desc:0 "The fascists, capitalists and aristocrats beyond our borders outnumber us greatly! Our revolution cannot be crushed before it has even properly begun. Participation in the Bauernmiliz has long been voluntary, but the dire situation demands that this changes. The old Council would've never approved this, but we must implement forced conscription. Otherwise we will be slain and enslaved."
PYT_mass_mobilisation:0 "Mobilise the Workers"
PYT_mass_mobilisation_desc:0 "We still do not have enough soldiers! More is needed to fight the oppressors abroad. We have no choice but to conscript the workers, whose loyalty to our revolution cannot be doubted. They will fight fanatically to protect their livelihood and their families! Unfortunately the workshops, factories and farms will be emptier than before, but this is a temporary measure."
PYT_the_road_to_communism:0 "The First KPG Party Congress"
PYT_the_road_to_communism_desc:0 "It is time for Greifenmarschen to become a true communist state, modeled after Stalliongrad and the writings of comrade Caramel Marks. Wingbert and his fellow KPG members will begin preparations for a grand conference where representatives of all workers' councils will come together to reform Greifenmarschen."
PYT_the_trust_of_the_people:0 "The People's Trust"
PYT_the_trust_of_the_people_desc:0 "Many in our nation still doubt and distrust us, instead of eagerly welcoming the revolution which only seeks to make their lives better. Wingbert is planning to hold a speech in Oldwingburg to convince the people that they mean no harm to them. Unless they are bourgeois scum, of course."
PYT_educate_the_populace:0 "Teach the People"
PYT_educate_the_populace_desc:0 "Long have we complained that our education system has been tainted by bourgeois ideas. Now we finally have the power to make necessary changes and teach the people of the dangers of capitalism and private ownership, and how they can bring an end to our liberty and equality!"
PYT_party_congress:0 "Solidarity Forever"
PYT_party_congress_desc:0 "We will not let borders or walls divide us. All proletariat of the world must stand together, regardless of race or species! Only united can we overthrow our oppressors and liberate all nations from bourgeois and aristocrat tyranny."
PYT_deal_with_bourgoise:0 "Securing the Revolution"
PYT_deal_with_bourgoise_desc:0 "By expanding and strengthening the People's Army we ensure our safety from external threats, but further measures must be taken to counter the threats within. Even as we speak petty bourgeoisie are plotting against us in the shadows, for we have prevented their rise to power. It is time we take care of them."
PYT_model_citizens:0 "Model Citizens"
PYT_model_citizens_desc:0 "Some of the peasants and workers in Greifenmarschen are shining examples of the ideal proletariat, selflessly labouring day and night to ensure their family earns a living. These New Griffons should be a standard for all our citizens! We should spread word of their accomplishments via propaganda. May all griffons in Herzland one day become like them!"
PYT_the_five_year_plan:0 "Planned Economy"
PYT_the_five_year_plan_desc:0 "Now that we have confiscated the means of production from the capitalist scum, we are able to centralize our economy and control it with precision. Plans need to be drafted on how we can ensure the well-being and prosperity of all Greifenmarsians. Only with rigorous execution of extensive plans can we achieve true communism."
PYT_nationalisation:0 "It Belongs to the State"
PYT_nationalisation_desc:0 "After extensive reforms our economy has become strong, and now we must ensure the benefits from it will be distributed evenly. With more extensive nationalisation and collectivisation, this can be accomplished with ease."
PYT_connect_nation:0 "The People's Railways"
PYT_connect_nation_desc:0 "Proper infrastructure is vital for economic growth. Our plans demand expansive infrastructure in order to be executed successfully. State projects must begin to build new railroads and trains!"
PYT_mass_industrialisation:0 "Jobs for the People!"
PYT_mass_industrialisation_desc:0 "Unemployment is a symptom of the capitalist disease. With communism, it will cease to exist. Of course, this takes time, so we can quicken the inevitable fall of unemployment by investing in the arms industry."
PYT_the_revolution_marches_on:0 "Herzland Shall be Red!"
PYT_the_revolution_marches_on_desc:0 "The Sick Bird of Griffonia is a corrupt, oppressive nation that exploits its workers and peasants without limit. We must stop this and liberate our brothers and sisters! General Secretary Wingbert says the time for war is now! Workers of Herzland, Unite!"

PYT_erebus_steps_in:0 "Erebus Steps In"
PYT_erebus_steps_in_desc:0 "Erebus Whiteplume, figurehead of the conservative GKVP faction, has successfully seized power in Greifenmarschen. Members of the Council have voluntarily resigned after Erebus held a speech about the flawed state of the democracy. Now Erebus can finally pass reforms he has desired for so long."
PYT_the_new_duke:0 "The New Duke"
PYT_the_new_duke_desc:0 ""Know that Greifenmarschen has entered into a new age of enlightenment. Know that time time has finally come for the one true lord of Greifenmarschen to take his place at the head of his people. Under my guidance Greifenmarschen will flourish, and all of the people shall rejoice! And pay homage to their new... guardian.""
PYT_ducal_guard:0 "Recreate the Ducal Guard"
PYT_ducal_guard_desc:0 "The old ducal guard represented the elite of the army of Greifenheim. They swore an oath to the duke himself, promising to give their lives for his should the need arise. Recreating this organization would no doubt be a wise idea."
PYT_legacy_of_erebus_i:0 "Legacy of Erebus I"
PYT_legacy_of_erebus_i_desc:0 "Erebus the First was a true hero who stood with his guard to the end against the peasant hordes that accosted him. At least, that will be the official story. And our dear Duke Erebus the second will do his utmost to honor his legacy of strength and courage."
PYT_ducal_secret_service:0 "Create the Herzoglicher Geheimdienst"
PYT_ducal_secret_service_desc:0 "While there are many of our subjects who hold nothing but love for the duke in their hearts, traitors still lurk around every corner. The Herzoglicher Geheimdienst will serve as a reminder of the duke's authority for the populace, the loyal will have nothing to fear after all."
PYT_fight_the_commies:0 "Crack Down On the KPG"
PYT_fight_the_commies_desc:0 "Communists, socialists, and their deluded ilk have no place in our new society. The workers will work, and they will do so for the good of the duke. If they refuse, well we have no shortage of empty graves that need filling in Greifenheim."
PYT_fight_the_democrats:0 "Crush the Opposition"
PYT_fight_the_democrats_desc:0 "The Greifenmarschen Volksharmonie-Partei is our only remaining rival in Griffenheim. While some would advocate lenience against this group, the Duke will suffer no questioning of his authority. The army is ready to deal a final blow to the GVHP, they only need the final order from the Duke."
PYT_advisory_parliament:0 "An Advisory Council"
PYT_advisory_parliament_desc:0 "With our opponents either dead or accepting of the Duke's authority, the time has come to reward those loyal to the true ruler of Greifenheim. An advisory Council will ensure that the people can present their concerns to the Duke in a respectful manner. The Council will now also oversee the bureaucracy of Greifenheim, ensuring that it always moves smoothly."
PYT_righting_old_wrongs:0 "Righting Old Wrongs"
PYT_righting_old_wrongs_desc:0 "Erebus the First always dreamed to sit upon the throne of the Griffonian Empire, and yet this was a dream that was never realized. His successor, Erebus the Second, will right this historic wrong by claiming the throne for himself, realizing the old dream of the old Duke."
PYT_fight_the_fascists:0 "Eradicate the NAP"
PYT_fight_the_fascists_desc:0 "The Nationale Aktionspartei is filled with traitors. Not a single one among their ranks can claim to be loyal to the Duke, and with each second that they are allowed to remain active their threat grows. If they will not bend the knee as his subjects, then their corpses will do so in their name."
PYT_ducal_industries:0 "Create the Herzoglicher Industrierat"
PYT_ducal_industries_desc:0 "Our economy is in dire need of something to guide it, to steer the market in a direction that pleases the Duke. The Herzoglicher Industrierat will ensure that our industries are all working together to ensure maximum efficiency, nothing less would do for the Duke."
PYT_modernism:0 "Modernisation Effort"
PYT_modernism_desc:0 "The idiotic democratic system used by the peasants was not very conducive to industrialization, with the peasants prefering to vote on every single brick laid down than any real economic progress. But the Duke demands that we drag Greifenheim into the future, and we shall do so with the utmost pace."
PYT_prepare_the_economy:0 "Prepare the Economy"
PYT_prepare_the_economy_desc:0 "The time for the ultimate conflict approaches, and if we are to be triumphant we must be prepared. The economy will have to be transformed to serve the army and the Duke, as that is its ultimate purpose."

PYT_a_guided_democracy:0 "A Guiding Claw"
PYT_a_guided_democracy_desc:0 "Erebus Whiteplume has been forced to do the unthinkable and seize complete control over the apparatus of the state. But this is not an action made out of some insane lust for power. Erebus saw that Greifenmarschen could not survive for long in its current state, and intends to fix the glaring flaws that lead to this situation in the first place."
PYT_army_standardization:0 "Military Standardisation"
PYT_army_standardization_desc:0 "The military of Greifenmarschen has always maintained a unique structure, in essence mirroring the state of its nation. This has spawned some truly perplexing ideas about how a military should be run. While it may anger them, the military cannot be allowed to maintain their outdated ways when war seems just behind the horizon."
PYT_guardians_of_freedom:0 "Guardians of Freedom"
PYT_guardians_of_freedom_desc:0 "While Greifenmarschen may have changed drastically in the last few months, it still remains a republic. By staying true to the ideals that originally founded this great nation, we have managed to secure the support of the populace. The people are proud of their freedom, and they are ready to die for it."
PYT_military_police_f:0 "Accountability"
PYT_military_police_f_desc:0 "Greifenmarschen may be a dictatorship ruled by the GKVP, but this does not grant the members of the government the right to do whatever they please. They are there to serve the people, and to ensure that they fulfill their sworn duty, the military police will be deployed to keep every single one accountable for their actions."
PYT_centralisation_of_power:0 "Centralisation"
PYT_centralisation_of_power_desc:0 "Greifenmarschen suffered from an inefficient and decentralized system of management. This system has caused untold problems for our nation over the years and has prevented any sweeping reforms from fixing the underlying issues of Greifenmarschen. We shall endeavor to fix these flaws in our new constitution."
PYT_the_senate:0 "Legal Opposition"
PYT_the_senate_desc:0 "The GKVP cannot be allowed to go unchallenged, as complacency could quickly lead to stagnation. Opposition parties shall be allowed to exist, as long as they are able to behave themselves."
PYT_the_new_republic:0 "A Republic Reborn"
PYT_the_new_republic_desc:0 "Erebus has fulfilled his promises, and Greifenmarschen remains a republic. It has been transformed by the recent upheavals in Griffonia, but its core values remain the same as they have always been since the tyrant Duke was killed. Long live Greifenmarschen!"
PYT_prepare_for_battle:0 "Let Them Come"
PYT_prepare_for_battle_desc:0 "The Griffonian Empire has set its covetous sight upon us, ready to bring our republic to an end. But the griffons of Greifenmarschen are ready for whatever they may throw at us. Let them come, they shall pay a high price to deprive us of our freedom."
PYT_clarification_of_voting:0 "Redefine Voting Laws"
PYT_clarification_of_voting_desc:0 "Greifenmarschen is one of the oldest republics in existence, and due to it we have ended up with a system of voting that could be described as insane. Everything has to be voted on, no matter how large or small the issue. Not only has this paralyzed Greifenmarschen in the past and present, but it is also a very expensive system to maintain. It will have to be removed."
PYT_new_cities:0 "Neuestädte Programm"
PYT_new_cities_desc:0 "Greifenmarschen is in dire need of new griffons to settle the portions of our land that we have not been able to settle ourselves. A series of grants and subsidies encouraging immigration to these portions of our territory will hopefully encourage foreigners to settle in Greifenmarschen."
PYT_projects:0 "State Industrial Programs"
PYT_projects_desc:0 "In order to bring our outdated economy into the modern age, a series of government programs designed to accelerate the process of modernization have been proposed. These would all have been voted on in the past, but a dictatorship does allow us to grease the wheels of democracy a bit."
PYT_agriculture:0 "Supporting Our Farmers"
PYT_agriculture_desc:0 "Agriculture is critical for Greifenmarschen and constitutes a large portion of its economy. But the recent upheavals on Griffonia have made many of our farmers destitute, and barely able to produce enough for themselves. To alleviate this problem, a large program designed to support these farmers has been proposed, it only needs final approval to be implemented."

PYT_harmony_prevails:0 "Harmony In Our Time"
PYT_harmony_prevails_desc:0 "Archibald Dawnclaw, figurehead of the harmonist GVHP faction, has successfully seized power in Greifenmarschen.

Members of different factions supported different proposals: KPG and NAP generally advocated rapid industrialisation and modernisation to drag the country to the new millenium, while GKVP and GVHP preferred more conservative agrarian reforms aimed at modernizing the countryside and focusing on agricultural production.\n\nThe debate lasted late into the night, until finally the Council agreed on what direction Greifenmarschen's economy should take.

A passenger train derailed on the old railroad from Romau to Oldwingburg, built with Imperial funding decades ago. Dozens of griffons have died and almost a hundred injured. Erebus Whiteplume proposed this day to be a day of national mourning, and the Council unianimously agreed and drafted a proper proposal which was then approved by the populace in a referendum two weeks later. The day of mourning was finally held three weeks after the accident.\n\nProponents of industrialization and modernization now say the accident was the fault of the agrarian program which moved funds away from renovating vital railways and used them to build roads in the sparsely populated countryside. They say this disaster would've been avoided if the government had instead focused on maintaining the vital railroads between urban areas."

In Nortfome, a group of frightened peasants attacked a tractor which was approaching their farm, destroying it and badly injuring its driver who was the owner of a neighbouring farm. The peasants claimed innocence in the following trial, saying that they were simply defending their home from a fearsome dragon.

Farmers organized a large protest in Oldwingburg which even threatened to burst into a riot. They claimed the proponents of industrialisation are favouring the urban areas too much and turning Greifenmarschen into a completely different nation. Clearly, the peasants are fools who want to remain stuck in the last millenium so they can languish in poverty and ignorance.

In addition each village sent a representative to Oldwingburg to elect the Statthalter, the symbolic leader of the nation who, despite lacking actual power, still commanded great respect.\n\n Out of the many candidates for the position of Statthalter, only four were likely to win the elections: old and ever-popular Erebus Whiteplume, nationalist and Herzlander supremacist Dietrich Mach, devout Equestrian immigrant Archibald Dawnclaw and communist reformist Wingbert Rohmer.

However, Eros and his two companions Erion XII and Proteus III have only amassed more power to themselves and have shown no interest in creating any kind of democratic governing body.\n\nMost worryingly, the Archons have not made any statements regarding our independence and freedom. It is entirely possible they intend for it to end.\n\nA hectic emergency meeting of the council was held soon after the news arrived. The arguments lasted for hours, with council members getting exhausted in the end. Ultimately, it was for naught as no agreement was made on what should be done about the situation, leaving all factions frustrated. After several more days the Council finally decided that it might be wise to deny the legitimacy of the Archons' regency and hold a referendum about independence. Nothing else.\n\nErebus, Dietrich, Archibald and Wingbert all left the Temple of Boreas without saying a single word, newfound determination in their eyes.

After several more days the council finally decided that it might be wise to recognize the legitimacy of the Duchess' regency and hold a referendum about remaining loyal to her and her aristocratic allies.\n\nHalf the Council was outraged by the decision and said the Archon would've been a better regent, for he was a champion of the common griffons unlike Gabriela, who still had made no guarantee to let Greifenmarschen remain independent. Erebus, Dietrich, Archibald and Wingbert, tired of the squabbling, marched out of the Temple of Boreas without saying a single word, newfound determination in their eyes.

marschen.17.d:0 "Within months the popularity of Archibald Dawnclaw's young harmonist faction has skyrocketed, for it has promised to not only to maintain liberty but also peace, which the citizen-soldiers of Greifenmarschen appreciate as they can continue living their calm rural lives. Now that the regency crisis has proven too difficult for the deeply divided Council to oversome, Archibald Dawnclaw and the rest of GVHP have decided to intervene, trusting that majority of the common griffons will stand behind them.\n\nArchibald and other faction members arrived in front of the Temple of Boreas early in the morning and blocked the entrance by sitting in front of it, peacefully protesting the Council's lack of consensus. Other council members who came later were outraged, saying the harmonists were obstructing the democratic process. Archibald retorted that the Council had already been doing that because of their inner division and said they needed to settle their differences, speaking of the ancient Equestrian legend about Windigoes and how the leaders of the three tribes almost froze to death while arguing, only saved by their advisors finding common ground and befriending each other. He said the Temple would remain blocked until they did the same and apologized to their voters who they had completely failed with their lack of harmony and friendship.\n\nWhat followed was a violent fight as insulted and furious NAP, GKVP and KPG members attacked the harmonists and tried to force their way in. Nearby citizens were shocked and intervened, as did the Bauernmiliz soon after. Three griffons lied dead and dozens of griffons were arrested. Dietrich, Wingbert and Erebus were all put to prison to await trial while GVHP members licked their wounds and assumed control of the country. Archibald promised democracy would soon be reinstated after several necessary reforms had been made. He did not say anything about holding referendums to approve those reforms, but most of the populace trusted Archibald and his faction."

marschen.18.d:0 "As the economy of Greifenmarschen grows, so does inequality. In recent months this has resulted in constantly growing support for KPG, whose communist leader Wingbert Rohmer has promised to improve the lives of the unfortunate and downtrodden, dreaming to make Greifenmarschen a truly equal nation. In his eyes it is already proto-communist, and could become truly communist with only a few reforms. Reforms which he has been unable to propose because of opposition from other factions.\n\nWingbert knew that majority of the workers supported him now. It was time for change at last as the citizenry's faith in the Council was dropping. Now or never, he reasoned, and managed to persuade the rest of KPG to begin preparations for a revolution.\n\nThe morning sky shone bright red in the early morning as communist sympathisers, all armed, seized every public building and factory in Oldwingburg and arrested militiagriffs who did not wear signature red armbands, which showed allegiance to KPG. The coup was almost flawless, with only several gunfights breaking out resulting in a mere clawful of dead griffons.\n\nMembers of other factions in the Council gathered in front of the occupied Temple of Boreas, whose statue of the god had been defaced and which now had a red flag on its roof. Wingbert and his militia were there waiting for them. Before the enraged Council members could even ask what was happening, Wingbert held a speech condemning their actions and calling them traitors to the people. This made some members furious, especially the NAP deputy Wilke Truthahn who pulled out a gun from his pocket and aimed at Wingbert's head. Unfortunately Wingbert was faster and shot him in the leg, cripping him as communist militiagriffs seized him and arrested the other Council members. When Archibald, breaking down in tears, asked why they were being arrested, Wingbert calmly said he had already told them: They were guilty of betraying the common griffons of their nation who had voted for them in the first place.\n\nWhen concerned citizens asked KPG about the next elections, Wingbert bluntly said they would not be held and instead the country would be ruled by numerous workers' councils. Plebicites were now a thing of the past."

marschen.19.d:0 "Economic and social instability has plagued Herzland for decades now, and while Greifenmarschen has been relatively unaffected, griffons elsewhere languish in poverty and misery. Rising star Dietrich Mach has been holding passionate speeches about the liberation of their fellow Herzlanders and the spreading of Greifenmarsian liberty beyond their borders. Meanwhile the veteran NAP deputy Wilke Truthahn has for decades now blamed the Archons for all the suffering in the Empire, claiming it was their plot to destroy it in the first place. His anti-clerical sect, the Old Believers, is expanding rapidly, especially now that the Archons have become involved in the regency dispute. Both have been advocating aggression, which all three other factions are hesitant about.\n\nIt was clear to both Dietrich and Wilke that simply holding fiery speeches wouldn't do anything. Now that the freedom of Greifenmarschen was threatened and Archons plotted in the shadows, it was time to strike immediately! They could no longer suffer the Council to stand in their way and doom their beloved homeland. The paramilitarist wing of NAP, the infamous Bohngarde, rallied behind them as they prepared to break the political deadlock with force if necessary.\n\nThe Council held a meeting as usual, but curiously not a single member of the NAP faction was present. An hour of political debate later they heard the echoes of a marching group outside. Soon the doors of the Temple were flung open and heavily armed militiagriffs burst inside, led by Dietrich and Wilke. They tried to speak but the Council was loudly panicking and protesting, so Wilke took out his gun and shot into the ceiling to silence them, then shouted that the national revolution had broken out and that no one was allowed to leave. Dietrich said in a more calm tone that the Council had been disbanded and the NAP would form the new government of Greifenmarschen. At gunpoint, Wilke demanded the former members of the council, now regular griffons, to swear eternal allegiance to NAP in the name of Boreas. Wingbert Rohmer spat on his face, smacked the pistol out of his grasp and tried to fly out of the building, but was stopped when a militiagriff shot him in the wing and grounded him. Whimpering and barely alive from the impact, he swore allegiance to NAP along with the rest of the council.\n\nDietrich held a speech in the center of Oldwingburg on the following day, promising to reinstate democracy once Greifenmarschen's independence was secured. Wilke added it would not be reinstated until the Archons were hanged."

Yet this experience only means he knows all the faults of the democracy of Greifenmarschen, especially after his travels abroad to countries such as Equestria and Sicameon. He can't help but admit that even despotic countries such as Brodfeld are run more efficiently than the political quagmire of Greifenmarschen, where constant referendums and elections are the norm. He still loves his country and its institutions like a father would love a disabled child, but his wishes to extensively reform the nation have so far been denied by the three other factions.\n\nNow, in perhaps the most dire time in his country's long history, changes are more necessary than ever yet remain undone. The harmonists, fascists and communists all squabble in the Temple of Boreas, unable to even fully agree whether to support the Regent or what they should do if relations turn sour with the Empire. His old age has perhaps made him cranky, but nevertheless the GKVP, a faction that wouldn't even exist without him, supported him wholeheartedly when he proposed something radical: A coup.\n\nThe Council held a meeting as usual, with most members attending. Once again the arguments went nowhere as the factions failed to agree on anything. It was then that Erebus stood up. He began to speak and the building went silent at once, for everyone respected the old and wise griffon. In his speech, he told about how wonderful Greifenmarschen was, a unique nation in the world where the will of the people had the ultimate power. Then he sighed deeply and spoke of the flaws in the system, how completely impossible it was to pass reforms and how laughable the Council's response to the regency issue had been. He said change was needed, and it was needed now, and asked if the other members of the council could trust him and GKVP to do what they must. Many were hesitant, especially the leaders of the factions who all had their own plans of seizing power, but all agreed that Erebus was indeed right about the state of the country and GKVP, as agreed, enthusiastically showed support. Erebus swayed those who doubted by saying they needed to trust him if they wanted Greifenmarschen to survive, and if they wanted to resist him, they should remember that the citizens stood behind him and supported him. They wouldn't want to betray their own people, would they?\nAnd so dozens of Council members marched outside quietly and in good order, leaving Erebus and GKVP in charge of the country, for now."

What he found was a mysterious, unmarked letter. He opened it out of curiosity, only to discover to his horror that it was a mail bomb. In his mind he already prayed to Boreas, but the bomb did not explode. He sighed, both relieved and confused, and read what the actual letter said.\n\nIt was a warning.

Our country is already a country of the workers, the common griffons, for we have no cruel lord or greedy priest ruling over us.

Our system of direct democracy made us unable to make quick changes and decisions, and those are needed to respond to these looming dangers to our freedom and equality."\n\n"That is why we seized power. And now you may wonder and fear, will you now lose all your personal belongings? Friends, comrades, we communists are not thieves. We want to seize the means of production, the engines of wealth, and ensure their produce is spread fairly and no one uses it for their own personal gain.

But with the recent crisis sizing the small nation resulting in Erebus Whiteplume and the GKVP establishing a temporary dictatorship, Griefenmarschen once again rested under autocratic rule. Erebus was a veteran of the political landscape and his reputation for honesty and loyalty to the democratic traditions of Griefenmarschen made him a dictator that most of the factions could trust to see them through the crisis now facing the nation. And if he had ruled as he intended, it is possible that this would have resulted in Griefenmarschen enduring the crisis with its democratic traditions intact.\n\nBut fate had other plans for Erebus.\n\nIn the days after the coup, the old leader slowly grew more distant from his fellow members of the GKVP. He grew restless, each day appearing more tired than the last. His demeanor harshened considerably, and old friends now barely knew him. But this situation might have been avoided, were it not for the fall. While for any young griffon, a fall from such a height would not be very dangerous, Erebus was old, and it was a miracle that his body did not break. His mind, however, was a different story entirely.\n\nHe disappeared soon after, seeking the unmarked grave of the old duke, Erebus the first. Nobody truly knew what happened to him the days he was gone, but upon his return, it was evident that something had changed. After removing the few members of the GKVP who could pose a threat to his commands, he made an unusual request. A ducal crown made to be an exact replica of the old crown of the Duke.

marschen.31.d:0 "Shortly after hearing the news of Erebus assuming the title of Duke, KPG members were shocked and outraged, with their leader Wingbert Rohmer claiming that a counter-revolution had taken place, organized by insidious aristocrats and bourgeoisie who desired to destroy their proto-communist nation. He said they had to resist. The faction soon began to prepare a massive general strike in Oldwingburg which would weaken the economy and show the Duke that the common griffons opposed him and his takeover.\n\nErebus cared little for their complaints, and he knew how to deal with the dissidents.\n\nA mass protest began earlier today, with thousands of workers and peasants from all across the country refusing to work gathering in the capital. The crowd slowly made its way to the Temple of Boreas, vandalizing and burning buildings along the way. When they arrived, they realized they had walked into a trap.\n\nAll streets leading away from the Temple were blocked by soldiers. Sharpshooters appeared in windows in buildings around them. A machine gun had been set up in front of the statue of Boreas. There the Duke stood, his expression cold as stone, and gave the sign to his loyal troops.\n\nThe massacre began. None survived."

marschen.32.t:0 "Shattering the NAP"
marschen.32.d:0 "The leaders of Nationale Aktionspartei were gathered in a discreet house in the countryside, far from the threat of the Duke's guard. Their topic of discussion was the duke himself, and how they would deal with the troublesome griffon. He had broken his old promises, and the leaders of the NAP knew that it was only a matter of time before they themselves were declared traitors to Griefenheim, and everyone knew the fate of traitors. They talked long into the night, discussing everything from a radical alliance with the KPG, to an immediate putsch with the military units still loyal to them.\n\nSo overtaken were they by their discussion that they failed to notice their guards outside stop reporting in, to notice the doors being sealed, the fire being set.\n\nWhen they finally realized what had happened, it was already too late, and the building was soon consumed in a raging inferno.\n\nWithout its leaders, the rest of NAP was unable to organize a resistance as soldiers were sent to arrest their members en masse. Thousands were imprisoned, deemed guilty of high treason and then sentenced to die. Mass graves near prison camps filled quickly and new ones had to be dug. Some execution squads complained of lack of ammunition and said they had to use bayonets instead.\n\nAnother obstacle against the Duke had been removed."
marschen.32.a:0 "Death to Fascism!"

marschen.33.t:0 "The Strike Against GVHP"
marschen.33.d:0 "The extremist, the most dangerous opponents most likely to violently resist the glorious Duke, had all been taken care of. Now it was time to deal with the secondary threat to Ducal rule. Unlike the fascists or communists, they could not be simply accused of high treason or causing disorder. Archibald and the GVHP, along with sympathisers who wanted the democracy to be restored, had done nothing against the law yet, resisting without violence and plotting nothing. Their protests were calm and well-organized. The Duke, however, had a plan.\n\nDuring a peaceful, quiet night in Oldwingburg, the age-old Temple of Boreas suddenly caught fire. A massive storm of flames engulfed it and it soon collapsed. The following morning the news spread and the country was in shock. The Duke soon informed the populace that damning evidence had been found that proved GVHP members were behind the fire. This quickly turned a large part of the populace to the Duke's side, against GVHP. On the following day the Duke assumed Emergency powers, suspending many civil liberties. Archibald and his faction was accused of starting the fire and plotting a coup and were arrested en masse, without any protest from the citizens who had only some months ago loved democracy.\n\nPrison camps in Nortfome were quickly filled with tens of thousands of griffons. Thousands of them, including Archibald, would die in the squalid conditions. Some weeks after the fire, when the rubble of the Temple had been cleared, the construction of a new building began.\n\nThe Ducal Palace."

marschen.34.t:0 "A Benevolent Dictator"
marschen.34.d:0 "Greifenmarschen was dying, that fact had become inescapable over the last few months. The flaws of the very core of the republic, the centerpiece which held the entire state together, had manifested themselves in the very worst ways possible. But these flaws had been present from the beginning of the peasant's republic, during its chaotic birth from a revolution against a tyrant. In many ways, the mistakes that the original founders made are understandable. A desire to avoid a tyrannical government and the lack of any real examples of such a republic created the original laws that still governed Greifenmarschen to this day.\n\nElections were to be frequent and referendums common, to avoid a malicious government sealing their hold upon the apparatus of the state. But in the end, these very safeguards slowly strangled the republic. Eventually resulting in the bitter stalemate that has paralyzed the republic for months now. And when it looked like the republic would fall victim to its own flawed creation, one of its oldest political players intervened.\n\nErebus seized power in an effort to finally fix the problems that so nearly sent the republic to its death. He is loyal to the republic, and the ideals that it stands for, and as such was willing to seize dictatorial powers to save it. Through a bold plan of reform, both created from his own thoughts and inspired by foreign democracies, he intends to fix the fatal flaws of Greifenmarschen. Only time will tell if he is successful.\n\nThe republic will be saved from itself."

marschen.35.t:0 "Article 9"
marschen.35.d:0 "Article 9 of the new bill shall centralize the state around the government. While the provinces of Greifenmarschen had enjoyed an extreme amount of autonomy before, this eventually resulted in the government being unable to enforce its will upon the majority of the nation. Every province in Greifenmarschen is now made subordinate to the central state, with their privileges now drastically reduced. The central government will have final say on all matters that concern it in the provinces, and the autonomy of the provinces can now be freely modified at the command of the state. All provinces must follow the laws of Greifenmarschen, and no exceptions will be made.\n\nPerhaps we can finally get something done now."

marschen.36.d:0 "Article 21 of the bill redefines the very concept of voting in Greifenmarschen. While previously every small change in the legislature could easily result in a nationwide referendum, now the people will elect representatives to the government, who will vote on these issues on their behalf. Referendums can now only be triggered upon the will of the president, who also holds the final say over what proposals shall pass into law.\n\nHopefully, we won't have to organize another referendum for decades."

marschen.37.t:0 "Article 37"
marschen.37.d:0 "According to article 37 of the bill, an opposition to the ruling government shall exist at all times. The opposition should serve as an observer for the ruling party of the GKVP, challenging the government on the actions that they take. The opposition shall never exceed the GKVPs amount of seats in Congress, and therefore will not be allowed to run in the same amount of areas as the GHVP. While these laws may be somewhat loosened in the future, Greifenmarschen will remain a dictatorship for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe opposition shall never overstep their boundaries."

#Focus:
CRY_NLR_night_shroud:0 "The Night's Shroud"
CRY_NLR_night_shroud_desc:0 "Far from Canterlot, far from Manehattan, the Empress has sent us to assert control over the subjugated Crystal Empire. The Mi Amore family will bend the knee, and the Crystal Ponies will know that their true ruler is Nightmare Moon. Should they prove themselves to be loyal and cooperative, we just might treat them kindly in return." 
CRY_NLR_royal_family:0 "Fate Of The Royal Family"
CRY_NLR_royal_family_desc:0 "The Crystal Princess and her consort are the Empire's unifying factor. They must see reason and cooperate with our new rule, or the disused dungeons will be having its first occupants in a thousand years. Nightmare Moon has made this our first priority."
CRY_NLR_rare_privilege:0 "A Rare Priviledge"
CRY_NLR_rare_privilege_desc:0 "After much deliberation, the Empress has sent one of her close confidants to rule in her steed over the Crystal Empire. To everypony's surprise, she has sent Rarity, one of the elements of harmony. This has not gone without complaints from the thestral garrison, but the Empress has assured us that Rarity is loyal and obedient."
CRY_NLR_reward_supporters:0 "Nightfall"
CRY_NLR_reward_supporters_desc:0 "Nightmare Moon has been impressed with our quick and capable takeover of the Crystal Empire. She has chosen one of her most devoted followers, Misty Night, to guide the Crystal Empire through the night and establish a haven for thestrals. All praise Her resplendent Majesty!"
CRY_NLR_convince_royalty:0 "Convince Cadance And Shining"
CRY_NLR_convince_royalty_desc:0 "In the times before the upheaval, Rarity was on familiar terms with the previous rulers of the Crystal Empire. Despite the changed situation, she believes she can convince them to assist in keeping the ponies content with the new regime. It only takes a generous offer, of course."
CRY_NLR_crystal_bat_caves:0 "Encourage Thestral Settlement"
CRY_NLR_crystal_bat_caves_desc:0 "Batpony population is almost nonexistant in the Crystal Empire. No records exist of their presence before the disappearance, and since the Empire's return, very few have decided to make their home this far north. The Empress and [CRY.GetLeader] find this unacceptable, and are coordinating together to create an immigration campaign aimed at thestrals."
CRY_NLR_solarist_reprisals:0 "Solarist Reprisals"
CRY_NLR_solarist_reprisals_desc:0 "There are many who still cling to their outdated values and rolemodels. We must remind the ponies that the new order is here to stay, and dissidents will not be tolerated. So it has been decreed."
CRY_NLR_maintain_principles:0 "Maintain Harmonic Principles"
CRY_NLR_maintain_principles_desc:0 "Rarity is aware that the Empress... takes a more heavy-hoofed approach to rulership, but this doesn't mean we have to abandon the values ponies held true since the unification of the Three Tribes. The populace will be assured of our good intentions."
CRY_NLR_night_guard_veterans:0 "Night Guard Veterans"
CRY_NLR_night_guard_veterans_desc:0 "After a request from our cautious ruler, the Empress has acquiesced and allowed the transfer. Within the month, some of the most battle hardened and valourous batpony soldiers will make their home here in the Crystal Empire, which will ensure that any neighsayers think twice before acting in dissent."
CRY_NLR_lunar_admin:0 "Direct Rule From Crystal City"
CRY_NLR_lunar_admin_desc:0 "[CRY.GetLeader] has made it very clear that this administration's focus is on the Crystal City. Our objective is to divert as much of the nation's resources as possible down south, whether it is in produced goods or ores from the crystal mines. The Empress will have her quotas fulfilled."

FINSKABAT:0 "Snow Puff is part of a thestral tribe that migrated far north many generations ago, and has thus adapted to cold more than their ancestors in the south. Snow Puff herself was the one who convinced her tribe to support Luna as she advocated for reforms, and participated in combat on the Empire's northern frontier. She had a habit of getting extremely drunk before battle, then recklessly charging at the enemy while screeching obscene words. For her brave and loyal service, she was rewarded a position in the Night Guard and quickly rose through the ranks. Now, she has been assigned to the frigid Crystal Empire, and she feels like being home."

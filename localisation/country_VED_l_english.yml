 VED_Fascist_Prince:0 "An Authoritarian Prince"
 VED_Fascist_Prince_desc:0 "We have decided to accept Ondska's offer of marriage. While many see him as cruel or dishonourable, they are simply weak-minded.

 VED_New_Court:0 "A New Court"

 VED_Proclamation:0 "The Proclamation"

 VED_Matters_Heroism:0 "Matters of Heroism"
 VED_Matters_Heroism_desc:0 "Traditionally every heir apparent has been required to pass several trials to prove their heroism and ability to rule as the rightful leader of Vedina. If the Princess cannot pass these challenges, she has no right to inherit the throne."

 VED_Prepare_desc:0 "The princess has announced in a speech that life at court will prepare her for little, that to learn how to rule she must embark on a quest. Her bags are packed and the transport is ready, now where will her adventure take her?"
 VED_Honour:0 "The Quest of Honour"
 VED_Honour_desc:0 "The princess feels a need to prove her honour and valour, so when news of a group of bandits in a nearby village gets to her ears she is quick to ready herself to dispatch them."
 VED_Trechery:0 "Honour Gives Nothing"
 VED_Trechery_desc:0 "The princess' adventures across the world have been taking a toll, no longer does she see the best in her fellow griffons. No longer are honour and valor things of importance to her, its all about being the one on top at the end of anything. No matter how she got there."
 VED_Chivalry:0 "Chivalry To All"
 VED_Chivalry_desc:0 "The princess' adventures across the world have shown her that not all is well, that there are horrible creatures out there that will ruin anything they touch. But instead of demoralizing her, it has only made her commitment to honour and valor stronger. Through her experiences she has become a strong and chivalrous griffon, the pride of Vedina."
 VED_Means:0 "Support The Armoursmiths"
 VED_Means_desc:0 "The princess now knows that honour and chivalry give nothing, to be ruthless and merciless will give her more than those ever will. And so purchases of new arms have increased by a wide margin, weapons stronger than anything we've had before. Though the princess simply uses her new motto on any who question her, 'The ends justify the means.'"
 VED_Men:0 "Support The Knightly Orders"
 VED_Men_desc:0 "The princess' show of chivalry has become knowledge shared by all Vedinians, where she has become the pride of the Kingdom, with griffons signing up to the army just to show that they too are just as honourable and chivalrous as her."

 VED_Expect_Unexpected_desc:0 "Sköldsvärd spoke to the naval high command about their ships, asking them if it would not be better to have ships that lay under the water, ready to ambush any enemies that would come near Vedina's seas.

 VED_Valor_desc:0 "Today the princess was acting restless. When one of the maids asked her if something was wrong, she responded: "The rumours are true aren't they? While that monster rampages through our nation, I am here. This cannot go on, if the knights haven't dealt with it by the time I arrive, then I will." Having built up the courage she ran out of the room to put on her armor, leaving behind a very confused maid."
 VED_Charity:0 "The Quest of Charity"
 VED_Charity_desc:0 "The princess has announced a charity tour around Vedina where she will help the poor and downtrodden, for why have chivalry if you won't use it for good?"

 VED_New_War:0 "Visit The Border"
 VED_New_War_desc:0 "The new generals we recruited have minimal experience in war but also have many ideas.

 VED_Troop_Maneuveres_desc:0 "The generals have asked us if they can be allowed to try a military exercise to see if their strategies against the Republic might work, how quickly our griffons would arrive at the front line, how quickly would they dig their trenches and to test if the frontline logistics work in practice.

An aircraft painted in Vedina's flag colors flying over the city, casting its wide shadow on it.

 VED_Chivalry_Is_All:0 "Chivalry Is All"
 VED_Chivalry_Is_All_desc:0 "Chivalry is all there is for our people: They strive to be honorable, kind, generous and strong. The Vedinians are neither weak nor cowards, they know no fear and so neither must our knights. The institution of knighthood that has been a staple of Vedina since its inception is still there, and it must stay strong. Holding out against that which tries to corrupt them. Staying true to their pledges. Chivalry is all."
 VED_Matters_State:0 "Moving Forward As A Nation"
 VED_Matters_State_desc:0 "Vedina must not remain in the past, sticking to a bygone age. To truly be a great nation in this world, Vedina must wholeheartedly embrace modernity, without necessarily abandoning its traditions."
 VED_Left_Behind:0 "No Griffons Left Behind"
 VED_Left_Behind_desc:0 "Our nation has fallen far behind on matters of education, a majority of the country being illiterate and only the children of the elite receiving a proper education. For us to grow and compete on the world stage "
 VED_Build_Future:0 "The Foundation Of The Future"
 VED_Build_Future_desc:0 "Why simply catch up to our rivals when we can take the lead and outpace them? Vedina will not settle for third or second place, it will not settle for mediocrity, but it will shine as the world's star, for it will look to the future rather than the present."
 VED_Education_All:0 "Education For All"
 VED_Education_All_desc:0 "The new education programs have seen large successes. It's time to nationalize this system to make every Vedinian benefit from an education, no matter the class. Soon enough our school system will rival that of Equestria!"
 VED_Popular_Education:0 "Popular Education"
 VED_Popular_Education_desc:0 "While we have started educating young griffons we still have a problem with adolescents who have nothing to do and turn to delinquency. A higher education is something all of these young griffons should seek, and be given."
 VED_Military_Education:0 "Military Education"
 VED_Military_Education_desc:0 "The soldiers have fought many a battle and experienced many trials, the reunification was difficult and hard fought but a success. We now have the experience, now its time to get the expertise."
 VED_New_Weapons:0 "New Weapons"
 VED_New_Weapons_desc:0 "Vedina has great weapons that compete well against the rest of Griffonia's arsenal. But who says that this is the end of arms technology? We must get even better weapons and cement our status as a nation forever leading in arms."
 VED_Armoured_Tractors:0 "Armoured Tractors"
 VED_Armoured_Tractors_desc:0 "Many nations have been investing in armoured warfare, and so we must make investments of our own if we wish to compete with the major powers of the world. Though for now a bit of steel on a tractor should work, right?"
 VED_Big_Guns:0 "Big Guns"  
 VED_Big_Guns_desc:0 "One of the modern staples of warfare is artillery. Massive shells of destruction that can break armies through an endless barrage of carefully aimed shots. While a rifle may be able to shoot soldiers a shell will pulverize entire squads. It might not be honourable, but none can deny it's effective."
 VED_Building_War_Economy:0 "Building A War Economy"
 VED_Building_War_Economy_desc:0 "We can have as much knowledge about arms and artillery as we like, but without production it will just be blueprints scattered in the wind. Our arms production must increase to arm our men, and have us be ready for war if it comes."
 VED_First_Railway:0 "First Railway"
 VED_First_Railway_desc:0 "Engineers have started work on a national railway that connects to Turhamn. A new nerve system to connect our nation and its regions together, it is truly an admirable, albeit expensive, project."
 VED_Rebuild_New_Age:0 "A New Age For Transportation"
 VED_Rebuild_New_Age_desc:0 "Vedina is more connected than ever before, with railways spanning across much of the nation, though a problem lingers of the fact that much of our regular roads are still made of dirt or gravel. Lets turn this soil into modern asphalt!"
 VED_Connecting_The_Countryside:0 "Connecting The Countryside"
 VED_Connecting_The_Countryside_desc:0 "The work that's been done in infrastructure has been fundamental and grand, but while many of the major cities are connected now the countryside has been left in the dust. This inequality must change if we wish for Vedina to truly be connected."
 VED_Motorcar_Industry:0 "The Motorcar Industry"
 VED_Motorcar_Industry_desc:0 "With the new robust roads of Vedina, many businesses have started moving produce and supplies with longhaul trucks that travel across the whole nation.

 VED_Place_To_Port:0 "Place To Port"
 VED_Place_To_Port_desc:0 "There are not many harbors in Vedina for either civilians or the navy to dock at. If we wish to patrol our coasts then we must have a place for our ships to port and resupply. It is a simple matter of logic to have it."
 VED_Build_New_Economy:0 "A New Economy"
 VED_Build_New_Economy_desc:0 "Vedina runs on a decaying husk of an outdated economy, unsuited to our new modern lifestyle. Many of our people live on mere pocket-change, struggling to so much as put food on the table, much less pay rent or vital taxes. A state-sponsored project to start and build industrial facilities, to provide jobs for the population, will help vitalize our economy."
 VED_Build_Consumerism:0 "Build Consumerism"
 VED_Build_Consumerism_desc:0 "Our country runs on the whirring engine of our industry, but any engine, no matter how good, requires a hearty kick-start. A cash-injection should be enough financial aid to our industrial base to assure continued, exponential growth."
 VED_Limited_Welfare_Reforms:0 "Limited Welfare Reforms"
 VED_Limited_Welfare_Reforms_desc:0 "The poor of Vedina are, and have always been, a sorry sight. They do nothing but drag down our reputation, pulling us deeper in the stigmatized hole of Griffonian nations we're struggling to crawl out of. Many agree that helping them will also help us, and the more liberal-leaning members of the court have been proposing new welfare legislature."
 VED_Labour_Reform:0 "Labour Reform In Vedina"
 VED_Labour_Reform_desc:0 "Worker's rights are only a suggestion not a guarantee in the modern day Vedina, nothing more than an empty promise that never gets followed up on. If we truly want a happy nation we must make sure the workers have more rights, shorter workdays and vacation time to actually spend time with their families. We are not machines but living beings, we need rest sometimes."
 VED_Retraining:0 "Worker Retraining"
 VED_Retraining_desc:0 "In our leap forward towards modernization, many of our farmers have been left jobless. With the uneducated workers moving from the agrarian countryside to bustling manufacturing centers, they cannot keep up with the shift towards industrialization. Retraining programs will teach them important aspects about working in factories."
 VED_Extend_Welfare_Reforms:0 "Extending The Welfare Programs"  
 VED_Extend_Welfare_Reforms_desc:0 ""Our valour is a beautiful apple with a nice ripe skin, though one may find that the core is nothing short of rotten. the nobles gorge themselves on their wealth while the peasants whose backs they stand upon go starving. This is neither fair nor just, how are we to have valour if our greatest institutions are built upon the bodies of the starved masses"."
 VED_Offshore_Oil:0 "Offshore Oil"
 VED_Offshore_Oil_desc:0 "Oil has been struck off the shores of Vedina. Pushing for its extraction and refining will take a heavy weight off the Vedinian economy, as we will no longer have to trade for the precious lifeblood of our war machine."
 VED_Tungsten_Expansion:0 "Tungsten Expansion"
 VED_Tungsten_Expansion_desc:0 "Tungsten has been found in large deposits throughout many Vedinian caves. Our land appears richer than we thought, and focusing on its extraction will greatly help our wartime industry in the long term."
 VED_New_Tools:0 "New Tools"
 VED_New_Tools_desc:0 "Though we now have many factories, the tools and machinery they still use border on the archaic. Dusty pieces of machinery more reminiscent of the feudal nations of the east rather than a nation on the cusp of the modern world pock Vedinian industry. To increase efficiency, we are to research more modern means and tools for production and manufacturing."
 VED_New_University:0 "The Great Universities"
 VED_New_University_desc:0 "Vedina will become a great nation in the fields of science and technology, but to accomplish this goal we must not stop at normal schools. By establishing universities with the finest lecturers brought from around the world, their knowledge can be transmitted to Vedinians aspiring to follow in their steps."
 VED_Prince_College:0 "The Princess' College"
 VED_Prince_College_desc:0 "Princess Lycklig has opened a new school for the poor but yet gifted, this will hopefully aid in getting us a new pool of talent to put to very good use."
 VED_New_Military_Theory:0 "New Military Theory"
 VED_New_Military_Theory_desc:0 "The planning of our offensives and defenses is not broad enough. We cannot be a haphazard nation with a military that moves as it likes. Every last move, every last breath. We must plan everything to the most minute of details, for otherwise chaos will consume us, and our armies will be routed completely."
 VED_Peasent_Levy:0 "The Peasant Levy"
 VED_Peasent_Levy_desc:0 "We will not win wars unless we utilize our greatest weapon: Our people. Vedinians are our most powerful tool in warfare and we will be able to defeat all enemies that come for us if we break them using raw griffonpower and our indomitable will."
 VED_Armoured_Offensive:0 "Armoured Offensive"
 VED_Armoured_Offensive_desc:0 "The future of warfare is not in griffons or in artillery. Whatever a griffon soldier could accomplish, a tank can do safer, stronger, even faster and infinitely more versatile. Mastering the use of armoured vehicles and tactics will further ensure our position as a fierce opponent that few would dare go up against."
 VED_New_Naval_Approach:0 "A New Naval Approach"
 VED_New_Naval_Approach_desc:0 "We must not forget about our biggest neighbour: the ocean itself. The sea is full of opportunities but also dangers, and thusly we should not restrict our understanding of warfare to land and air alone. Fighting on water poses its own set of challenges and rewards, and learning how to effectively utilize our naval power will cement our rule over the waves."
 VED_Consolidate_Royal_Rule:0 "The Princess In Control"
 VED_Consolidate_Royal_Rule_desc:0 ""
 VED_Royal_Marriage:0 "The Red Wedding"
 VED_Royal_Marriage_desc:0 "Princess Sköldsvärd has chosen a groom and preparations have begun for the most extravagant royal wedding. This has sent ripples of celebration throughout the nation, though there still exist corners of rumourous dissent from those who do not much like the princess."
 VED_Harmoy_Princess:0 "The New Sköldsvärd"
 VED_Harmoy_Princess_desc:0 "Sköldsvärd has changed ever since her marriage. She seems more happy, more upbeat. A weight has been lifted off her shoulders and she has seen the light of harmony, the ways of friendship that truly make a nation better. With her new social and labour reforms Vedina will become a better place than ever and she is finally happy to be princess."
 VED_Harmonious_Foreign_Policy:0 "Harmonist Foreign Policy"
 VED_Harmonious_Foreign_Policy_desc:0 "Our new foreign policy is simple, exporting friendship and harmony to all the lands we can. Trying to make every nation better than it ever was before, leaving the world a more pleasant place than it was when we arrived to it. The nations of the world squabble and pick regimes that are antithetical to their interests, so we have no choice but to export friendship, don't you see?"
 VED_Harmonious_Modernisation_Path:0 "Harmonist Industrial Policy"
 VED_Harmonious_Modernisation_Path_desc:0 "We can only get a modernised industry by leading our industry forwards ourselves, it will not advance on its own and we need not walk forwards, but make a great leap in technology and industrial practices. We will import as many experts as we can while giving workers enough rights that they truly want to work for their companies' well-being. Soon we will be an industrial powerhouse."
 VED_Harmony_New_Dawn_f:0 "A New Beautiful Dawn"
 VED_Harmony_New_Dawn_f_desc:0 "Things have changed in Vedina. No longer do our people dread to wake up to work themselves to death in a job that hates them. No longer must they hold their tongue lest they get lashes for speaking ill of the monarchy. Their free, they have liberty. We have harmony. What a wonderful morning..."
 VED_Age_Of_Chivalry:0 "An Age of Chivalry"
 VED_Age_Of_Chivalry_desc:0 "The knights enjoy their work, they want to do it. They are no longer a corrupt bureaucratic mess of noblegriffons forgetting their pledges, forgetting their honor. Taking bribes and working only for their own gain. Now, they are truly the model griffons. Loyal, hard working. Wanting nothing more than to uphold honor and chivalry across the land. Things are changing for the better."
 VED_Our_Place_In_The_World:0 "Our Place In The world"
 VED_Our_Place_In_The_World_desc:0 "Our place in the world is simple, Vedina is a nation of freedom and liberty. There is nothing more for us than to try and affect the world in the most positive manner we can. Spreading harmony across the world and teaching others about the power that friendship and harmony has."
 VED_Join_Entente:0 "Join The Entente"
 VED_Join_Entente_desc:0 "Isolation breeds weakness - Vedina must find allies on the world stage. The Aquileians, preaching liberty and freedom, appear to be good, trustworthy allies for Vedina to stand with. Democracies must stand united in the face of extremism. The emissaries will be sent to get Vedina to want us to join. Soon we will have a great ally standing with us."
 VED_Join_Griffonian_Alliance:0 "Join The Pan-Griffonian Alliance"
 VED_Join_Griffonian_Alliance_desc:0 "Vedina must not stand alone and isolated on the world stage, we must join an alliance. The best option is to join the Republic to the east. Despite [FAT.GetLeader]'s hatred of monarchism, we must work out a compromise."
 VED_Knights_Aquelia:0 "The Aquileian Order"
 VED_Knights_Aquelia_desc:0 "The democratic nation of Aquileia is a cornerstone of liberty and harmony, a nation of true believers in freedom and equality. And yet their institutions are still young, not having had the development that centuries has given Vedina. Their knights are rookies with rusted rifles and pig iron armor. To make sure that they live on and that the teachings of democracy do as well, we must send them help and teachers."
 VED_Knights_Republic:0 "The Republican Order"
 VED_Knights_Republic_desc:0 "The Griffonian Republic is a nation of democracy, one that has thrown off the imperialist yoke of the Empire and reinvented itself as a nation of liberty, where the people's wishes are listened to and where their wants and needs are tended to. But in the south, the Empire is rising once more. The shambling corpse rebuilding itself and coming back to enslave us all for a forlorn dream. We must send the Republic knights and teachers and help them to defend!"
 VED_Beacon_Of_Chivalry:0 "A Beacon Of Chivalry"
 VED_Beacon_Of_Chivalry_desc:0 "Today, the streets feel a little safer. The air smells slightly cleaner. The lights of Vedina look more vibrant. Shiny knights patrol, rifles ready, uniforms ironed, cuffs polished. In the face of so much adversity, Vedina's tradition of knighthood remains strong and forever adapting. All eyes watch the nation's royal guardsmen, the knight corps, the frequent tournaments. A beacon of modern chivalry in a sea of forgotten traditions."
 VED_Western_Agenda_Harmony:0 "The Western Agenda"
 VED_Western_Agenda_Harmony_desc:0 "An Equestrian delegation has recently visited Vedina, with only positive things to say. Against the lurking threat of socialism from the north and of monarchism from the ever expanding Empire, we have held out as a stronghold of harmony on the Griffonian continent, and our efforts have not gone unnoticed. The flags shine brighter in winds of democracy blowing from new allies."
 VED_Unity_With_Colonies:0 "Unity With The Forgotten Colony"
 VED_Unity_With_Colonies_desc:0 "Foreign ships stand docked in Vedina's harbours. Foreign, but not unknown. Friends from across the sea, here to shake claws and embrace in unity between nations. Nova Griffonia's flag flutters as high as Vedina's in front of the Royal Palace. The princess accepts the Nova Griffonian diplomats with a warm welcome. After such a long search, Vedina has finally found an ally. With any luck, one to last."
 VED_Errant_Colony_Harmony:0 "The Errant Colony"
 VED_Errant_Colony_Harmony_desc:0 "The old colony on Equus, the one that was abandoned long ago by the Empire: Nova Griffonia. They themselves are a danger to us all, a place of chaos and unrest that will spill back to its original home and destroy it, the peace that we have grown accustomed to would be swept away in an instant, and as such we have no choice other than to make sure our defenses hold."
 VED_Knights_Nova_Harmony:0 "The New Order"
 VED_Knights_Nova_Harmony_desc:0 ""The pointy end - you use the pointy end." Our Nova Griffonian friends have much to learn from our way of knighthood. Separated from the mainland for so long, their culture has grown stagnant. No fret, though. Now that our relationship has improved once again, we may catch them up with the forms of traditions that they have lost. Knight-Errants, Royal Knights and gleaming tournament champions are already on their way to Nova Griffonia to begin teaching a new generation of knights."
 VED_Guiding_Claw_Harmony:0 "A Guiding Claw"
 VED_Guiding_Claw_Harmony_desc:0 "The renegade colony of Nova Griffonia has existed for far too long. Squint on the far western shores of Vedina, and you can nearly see its high rock cliffs standing defiant against the waves, defiant against us and against a new order. No more. In secret, we prepare. In secret, soldiers board their landing crafts. In secret, the clock ticks to Nova Griffonia's righteous re-subjugation."
 VED_Boon_Of_West_Harmony:0 "Boon Of The West"
 VED_Boon_Of_West_Harmony_desc:0 "The first oil-coated surveyor could've been just a one-off event. The second, a coincidence. But when a third surveyor barged into the royal palace, dripping with oil and leaving a dark trail of petroleum in his wake of excitement, it became quite obvious what kind of treasures lie just beneath Vedina's soil to the west. Construction of extraction facilities should begin immediately."
 VED_Neutral_Princess:0 "The Pragmatic Ruler"
 VED_Neutral_Princess_desc:0 "The only way to protect Vedina is by choosing the path of neutrality. In its current state, the kingdom can neither risk provoking war, or being drawn into it. The only path in this case is for [Root.GetLeader] to keep the kingdom neutral."
 VED_Neutral_Foreign_Policy:0 "A Neutral Foreign Policy"
 VED_Neutral_Foreign_Policy_desc:0 "The first step on the path to neutrality is to embark on a foreign policy that makes our position clear. This will enable to us to trade with any country without fear of reprisal, while we gradually modernize."

 VED_Neutral_Modernisation_desc:0 "To avoid stagnation, and to be able to present ourselves as a nation able to back its neutrality, we must gradually bring our society forward so that it can be judged equivalent to the standards of the other leading powers."
 VED_Neutral_New_Dawn:0 "A New Dawn"
 VED_Neutral_New_Dawn_desc:0 "With our society lifted out from the cobwebs of the past, we are about to begin a new era for Vedina. An era where our industry will no longer be seen as backward, unable to support our ever-growing trade links and back our neutral stance on the world stage."
 VED_Death_Of_Chivalry:0 "Death of Chivalry"
 VED_Death_Of_Chivalry_desc:0 "Chivalry has protected Vedina for years. However, it's usefulness has come to an end. By casting off the last shackles of this outdated institution, we will be able to move into the modern era, and remain at a technological parity with our neighbours."
 VED_Isolation:0 "Vedina Isolated"
 VED_Isolation_desc:0 "We are beset on all sides by either enemies, or those not friendly to us. If that is the case, we must prepare ourselves to navigate our ship of state, our kingdom, through these rough waters. Sharpen your swords and ready yourselves Vedinians. The time for hard choices is nigh."
 VED_Join_Empire:0 "Join The Reichspakt"
 VED_Join_Empire_desc:0 "We have little choice. Despite our best efforts to strengthen our kingdom, Griffenheim's power is overwhelming and growing stronger. More importantly, their emperor is dead, and we will not be joining as a subject nation, but as an independent, junior partner. It might be the only way to save our kingdom."
 VED_Go_Alone:0 "Vedina Goes Alone!"
 VED_Go_Alone_desc:0 "At this crossroads, it is obvious we must stay isolated from the empire. Yes, Griffenheim is powerful, and has traditionally attempted to erode our very country's culture. But that is why we must continue to remain apart from the Empire, if we are to survive as a kingdom. That being said, it is unlikely that Griffenheim will take this well, so we must ready our defenses."
 VED_Knights_Empire:0 "Knights for the Empire"
 VED_Knights_Empire_desc:0 "In terms of material wealth, Vedina has little of value to give to the Empire, but we do have the honour and the skill of our knights."
 VED_Modern_Knights:0 "Modern Knights"
 VED_Modern_Knights_desc:0 "If we are to truly go alone, and survive the coming storm on the continent, we must modernize even our knights. No longer can they be shielded only by honour and valour."
 VED_War_Has_Changed:0 "War Has Changed"
 VED_War_Has_Changed_desc:0 "The face of warfare has changed. In order for us to meet it, we must loosen the restrictions on who can become a knight. Thus, we can expand our knightly arm and spur on both commoner and nobility to further heights in their service to Vedina."
 VED_Western_Agenda_Neutral:0 "A Western Agenda"
 VED_Western_Agenda_Neutral_desc:0 "Remaining neutral by ourselves can only go so far. Since we obviously cannot turn to the Griffonian Empire, and we cannot trust the Aquileians, then we must look westward to Nova Griffonia. Perhaps we northern griffons may find some common ground and if not, maybe we might find some kind of opportunity to strengthen ourselves."
 VED_Trade_With_Colonies:0 "Trade With The Colony"
 VED_Trade_With_Colonies_desc:0 "The Nova Griffonians have greeted our delegation with open wings! Now is the time to hammer out the specifics of our agreement and lay the foundations for a mutually beneficial relationship."
 VED_Errant_Colony_Neutral:0 "An Errant Colony"
 VED_Errant_Colony_Neutral_desc:0 "It is now abundantly clear that Nova Griffonia cannot be trusted. It has shown itself through its spurring of our well-meaning overtures to be a errant colony, unconcerned with Griffon matters and possibly hostile towards us. We must act to shore up our coastal defenses immediately!"
 VED_Knights_Nova_Neutral:0 "Chivalry in Nova Griffonia"
 VED_Knights_Nova_Neutral_desc:0 "Now that we are partners, we should share what we hold most valuable with Nova Griffonia, and our greatest asset, our chivalric ways, so that their knights may become as noble as ours."
 VED_Guiding_Claw_Neutral:0 "Our Guiding Claw"
 VED_Guiding_Claw_Neutral_desc:0 "For Vedina's safety and to ensure that our dangerous western neighbour does not threaten us, we must temporarily break from our goals of neutrality, and prepare for war against Nova Griffonia. It is not an enviable solution, but it is the only solution as they will inevitably eye us as a target for conquest."
 VED_Boon_Of_West_Neutral:0 "Boon of the West"
 VED_Boon_Of_West_Neutral_desc:0 "Thanks to our pursuit of a western agenda, we can now develop the oil resources of the resource-rich west. We merely need to put some time into developing them."

 VED_Evil_Princess_desc:0 "[Root.GetEvilPrincessFocusDesc]"
 VED_Evil_Princess_pr:0 "The Corrupted Princess"
 VED_Evil_Princess_pr_desc:0 "The princess has changed. No longer does she speak of valour or chivalry, and any limited reforms she had put in were pulled back. Her demeanor has changed. Now she snaps at others, lacks patience and wants everything done her way or you will be gifted a nice lead bullet to the head. The good she had in her has long since been corrupted. And now she speaks of cleaning up Vedina, both through the politics. And the people."
 VED_Evil_Princess_od:0 "Ondska's Takeover"
 VED_Evil_Princess_od_desc:0 "With the princess dead, there is nothing preventing Ondska from consolidating his power. After all, he is the only griffon fit to lead Vedina to take its rightful place in the world."
 VED_Evil_Foreign_Policy:0 "The Northern Axis"
 VED_Evil_Foreign_Policy_desc:0 "Vedina may stand in the corner of Griffonia, but we must not stand alone, surrounded by enemies and without allies. To survive the tides of hostility poised to crash against our borders, we must find those likeminded in this world and befriend them."
 VED_Evil_Modernisation:0 "A Forced Modernisation"
 VED_Evil_Modernisation_desc:0 "Vedina's archaic administration system has proved unable to handle the great leap forward into our transition as a modern nation. A rework has been long overdue, and now is high-time for it. Integration of new infrastructure projects into a new, more efficient and more organized system will yield better results in the grand scheme of things."
 VED_Evil_New_Dawn:0 "A Dark New Dawn"
 VED_Evil_New_Dawn_desc:0 "As the sun rises over Vedina it is a new day, one where the old has been dealt with and the new leaders are solidified in their power. There will be no deviation, no changes from the state set status quo. One will do what the state says or be found dead. Ah, a wonderful new dawn is it not? And i do think these borders don't go far enough..."
 VED_Doom_Of_Griffonia:0 "The Doom Of Griffonia"
 VED_Doom_Of_Griffonia_desc:0 "The resurgent Griffonian Empire grows like a tumour over the continent, driven by the urge to relive the bygone days of the old empire. As its soldiers storm its surrounding countries to restore glory which never truly existed, it's becoming clearer and clearer that, unless stopped, they will soon come knocking on Vedina's door. We must cut out this cancer before it spreads, and strike before they become unstoppable. We will avenge our forefathers and do today what they couldn't so many years ago. We will end the scourge of the Griffonian Empire for good."
 VED_Prey:0 "They're Just Prey"
 VED_Prey_desc:0 "We are surrounded by weak, squabbling nations stuck in petty infighting. They are weak and disorganized, while we stand strong and united. They are rabbits hidden in their burrows, and the wolves of Vedina have grown hungry. It's time we went out for a hunt."
 VED_War_Socialists:0 "Spilling The Reds' Blood"
 VED_War_Socialists_desc:0 "The red banner of socialism casts a dark, gloomy shadow over much of Griffonia. Spreading like an infectious plague, it has taken hold of many of our neighbours. We must be the quarantine, vaccine and cure to the scourge of socialism. We must stop its spread and eradicate it, to rid Griffonia of this ideology of filth."
 VED_Choose_Allies:0 "Choosing Our Allies"
 VED_Choose_Allies_desc:0 "When predatory animals attack, they will always single out lone prey, working together as a single pack. Until we become strong enough to stand on our own, we must seek allies on the world stage, to protect us from the great powers of Griffonia. When the bombs begin to fall and the guns being to smoke, we must make sure we have someone guarding our backs. It's high time we start looking."
 VED_Core_Socialists:0 "Making The Socialists One Of Us"
 VED_Core_Socialists_desc:0 "Unrest and sabotage are growing issues in the annexed formerly-socialist states. Though their dissident populations are few and far between, they still present a sizeable threat to the stability of our nation. Their acts of terrorism in the name of a dying ideology must be stopped and these territories better integrated."
 VED_War_Republic:0 "Cracking The Rotten Talon"
 VED_War_Republic_desc:0 "The Griffonian Republic is a rotten corpse of a nation, masquerading as a noble knight of the people. Like a diseased griffon, all it can do now is stumble and stagnate, and let the surrounding vultures peck off more while its people suffer. As the world's true masters of honour, it is our duty to help our fellow Griffons and strike down the failure of the Republic. Long live Vedina!"
 VED_War_NTR:0 "Civilize The Savages"
 VED_War_NTR_desc:0 "The backwards griffons and ponies united in the so-called [NTR.GetName] would make for fine thralls in our new empire. It is only natural Vedina takes what it deserves."
 VED_Core_FAT:0 "Subjugate Cloudbury"
 VED_Core_FAT_desc:0 "The lands formerly belonging to the Republic are teeming with bandits, brigands and guerrilas, still clinging to the idea of a united Griffonia. Our knights will make sure they forget such foolish notions as the Duchy of Cloudbury becomes an integral part of Vedina."
 VED_attack_empire:0 "Claim the Throne"
 VED_attack_empire_desc:0 "It is only natural for the strong to take from the weak - and [Root.GetLeader] is mighty indeed, unlike the pathetic weakling in Griffenheim. The time has come for Griffonia to welcome its new Empress!"
 VED_War_Corruption:0 "The Corruption Grows"
 VED_War_Corruption_desc:0 "The knights of Vedina have changed like the princess has. Honour is now traded for coin, and chivalry has drowned in blood. As the days pass, it becomes harder and harder to discern common bandits from royal knights. Theft and abuse have become little more than a new constant in the world of former knighthood. There is no more spark of honour, all that now glints in the eyes of knights is gold."
 VED_War_Preperations:0 "Preparing For War"
 VED_War_Preperations_desc:0 "Should Vedina find itself pulled into war on the continent, we make sure we are prepared. Our industry is not yet ready for a complete and total conversation to war-time production and for the absolute mobilization of the available workforce. If Vedina hopes to survive, it must make sure its people are ready to pour everything they have into pure, undeniable victory - not necessarily on the battlefield, but on the production front, in the fields and farms, in the laboratories, in the skies and on the seas. Vedina must prepare for the storm, or else be swept away."
 VED_Socialist_Border:0 "The Red Line"
 VED_Socialist_Border_desc:0 "To defend ourselves properly we must not allow ourselves to stand still and do nothing as the socialists pool and collect at our border, preparing to destroy the Vedinian way of life. If we do not fortify against them, then they will invade us. They will commit unspeakable crimes to the griffonesses, kill the griffons and who even knows what they will do to the chicks."
 VED_Coast_Forts:0 "The Coastal Wall"
 VED_Coast_Forts_desc:0 "Vedina's coasts have always been blessed in a way that they've never been attacked. Not in all of our wars has the enemy thought to land on our beaches. But that is no reason to grow content - comfort breeds weakness, and a sufficiently cunning enemy will see the soft underbelly of our coastline and think to attack. Therefore, we must begin creating proper defenses along the sea, a coastal wall will protect Vedina from seafaring invaders."
 VED_War_Changes_Evil:0 "A Dark Change"
 VED_War_Changes_Evil_desc:0 "The Knights of Vedina have completely abandoned the use of swords in duels. The era of true knighthood, of honourable single combat, thrilling sword fights and the code of chivalry is long gone, lost in the smoke of a pistol. Disputes are now solved quickly with guns as opposed to lumbering, heirloom swords. This lack of honour is now spreading to the battlefield as well. Why fight the enemy fairly when you can simply blow them to smithereens?"
 VED_Republic_Border:0 "The Republican Border"
 VED_Republic_Border_desc:0 "The Republic poses an existential danger to Vedina. How can our authority be upheld and remain believable when such chaotic threats lurk just beyond our border? If we are to protect our citizens from the propaganda and corruption of the mind that comes from republics, we must make sure that those filthy democrats know where the line is drawn."
 VED_Fuel_Fires:0 "It Demands More"
 VED_Fuel_Fires_desc:0 "The war machine demands sacrifices and so we shall give it what it demands, whatever it needs we shall give and what it wants shall be had. More guns, more tanks, more trucks and more shells. Fuel is coming out of the refineries at breakneck speeds, soon we will have fed it enough that victory is a fact not a possibility."
 VED_Continual_Army_Reform:0 "Army Reform"
 VED_Continual_Army_Reform_desc:0 "An army must know itself and what it needs before it can march against the ones that oppose it. The strategies and tactics, the equipment, support and morale coalesce to form the power and backbone of a modern army. While the griffons that fight are the body, we must nurture the mind of our war machine."
 VED_Land_War:0 "The War On Land"
 VED_Land_War_desc:0 "Without a clear military doctrine, our army has enjoyed many embarrassing situations in maneuvers. One general would order an encirclement while the other would dig in to face an enemy attack, causing our troops to get divided, flanked and destroyed by the enemy. Enough is enough, we will make a choice of doctrine and stick with it."
 VED_New_Tech:0 "New Technology"
 VED_New_Tech_desc:0 "The rifles of the past do not support the fast paced wars of today, a couple of shots per magazine and having to reload constantly. With the amount of griffons on the battlefield, we need more bullets to counteract them. The new standard Angrepps Gevär, made for powerful pushes forward and with enough bullets in a clip that one of ours can take out a dozen of them."
 VED_Arty_Tech:0 "Artillery Technology"
 VED_Arty_Tech_desc:0 "Artillery is the instrumental background to modern warfare, the drums of war beating in tune with the symphony of battle, following the troops like guardian angels, clearing their paths of enemies. Truly, a soldier's best friend is the artillery that moves with him."
 VED_Tank_Tech:0 "Tank Tech"
 VED_Tank_Tech_desc:0 "A tank is just a box on treads, with a giant gun sticking out of it, yes - it doesn't have to look pretty, it just has to work. The problem with Vedina's tanks is that they neither look pretty, nor do most of them work up to par with the steadily-updating requirements of the modern world. If we do not want to be beaten on the battlefield this has to change."
 VED_Spec_Ops:0 "Special Forces"
 VED_Spec_Ops_desc:0 "War is like demolition work - bringing down an enemy state is like bringing down a building. And if war is demolition, then our army is a sledgehammer. Powerful, yet bulky and unwieldy. And in demolition, we require things beyond sledgehammers, we require specialized tools. Tools strong enough to find the weak-points and use them."
 VED_Magic_Equipment:0 "Magical Equipment"
 VED_Magic_Equipment_desc:0 "Our industry in ordinary arms may be flourishing, or at least presentable, but that in magical arms has been rather neglected. Though we are griffons, magic is not lost to us, and it is equally useful as with Ponies. In fact, it may be even more useful to us than to Ponies, as our neighbours may not put nearly as much focus on it as we will, giving us a grand advantage"
 VED_Integrated_Support:0 "Integrated Support Teams"
 VED_Integrated_Support_desc:0 "An army marches on its stomach. Tanks are useless without fuel and maintenance. An eyeless griffon is doomed to trip. It is on these principles that we must make sure our troops get the required support units to function, logistics forces to maintain supply lines, engineers to maintain vehicles, recon to maintain the thin veneer of safety from ambushes."
 VED_Sea_War:0 "The Sea War"
 VED_Sea_War_desc:0 "The war on the seas has become one of the most important parts of war, so long as you control the oceans you control the world. Barging in on your enemies and invading with hordes from the seas. Destroying their global supply lines and starving their fuel guzzling army, a destructive unstoppable force. Truly, we must invest in the navy."
 VED_Little_Ships:0 "The Little Ships That Can"
 VED_Little_Ships_desc:0 "We cannot afford to have a fleet of only battleships and heavy cruisers and neither do we have the time to build a navy of that size, we must work to also make smaller ships to fill the gaps that are left and use them to patrol our coasts while the larger ships prepare for the proper battles that arrive in the sea."
 VED_New_Ports:0 "New Dockyards"
 VED_New_Ports_desc:0 "While we may want to build as many ships as possible this task is impossible without dockyards to construct them. To get ourselves the large navy that we need to truly protect our coasts and our people we must fund more dockyards as quickly as we can, we are already far behind and should not lag in this endeavor."
 VED_Under_Sea:0 "Under The Sea"
 VED_Under_Sea_desc:0 "While most assume that navies stand on the seas and keep watch, patrolling from the surface and making sure there are no invaders there are others lurking under it. Submarines patrolling our seas from under the enemies noses, laying mines and firing torpedoes at those that violate our sea space. The submarine is the assassin of the seas, quietly disposing of those ships that were not careful enough to avoid it."
 VED_Big_Ships:0 "Larger Vessels"
 VED_Big_Ships_desc:0 "Vedina will not win on the waters with an army of fishing boats. To ensure victory, we must focus on more heavy-duty ship designs. Fielding a navy built upon strength in numbers as opposed to the strength of individual ships is a sure-fire way to get out-maneuvered, bogged down, and ultimately sunk to the bottom of the sea. Such a fate will not happen to Vedina's sailors."
 VED_Plane_Dock:0 "Air Carriers"
 VED_Plane_Dock_desc:0 "The inefficiency of port airstrips that support our navy has been proven time and time again as by the time our planes arrive to the naval battles taking place they are naught but over, to truly get the aerial support we need to have a strong navy we must make ships that are themselves airstrips. The idea of an aircraft carrier has long been thrown around in the global spheres of naval thought its quite time for us to make that idea a reality."
 VED_Mass_Ship_Production:0 "Mass Naval Production"
 VED_Mass_Ship_Production_desc:0 "Dockyards will stretch over Vedina's shores. Booming with activity, forests of cranes will construct massive warships, cruisers, destroyers and dreadnoughts from the ground up, from empty metal husks to efficient floating fortresses ready to protect Vedina's waters. We will not simply survive, we will not simply win, we will dominate the seas. Vedina will rule the waves, or Vedina will not rule at all."
 VED_Air_War:0 "The War In The Air"
 VED_Air_War_desc:0 "Entering a new era of warfare, Vedina is tasked with embracing a whole new type of war, the one in the skies, between the clouds. Stagnation will only lead to our doom, and to win is to realize that controlling the skies is as important as controlling the seas and the ground. Pilots, assemble at your stations! Vedina rules the skies!"
 VED_Light_Air:0 "Light Air Doctrine"
 VED_Light_Air_desc:0 "In the skies, speed is key. When air combat boils down to its most basic element, the dogfight, it stops being about armour or weaponry, but about which aircraft is more nimble. The faster rabbit always outruns the  bear and lives to see another day. We will outmaneuver our opponents like a swarm of mosquitoes taking down an  elephant through teamwork and coordination."
 VED_Close_Encounters:0 "Aerial Ground Support" 
 VED_Close_Encounters_desc:0 "Air power is important, but useless if unable to support the infantry. Toning down the air-to-air weaponry of our airplane designs and trading it for air-to-ground capabilities will allow us to support our armed ground forces in attacks and defense, so long as our close air support is protected by other fighters."
 VED_Air_Detection_Equipment:0 "New Air Detection Equipment"
 VED_Air_Detection_Equipment_desc:0 "A flock of coming crows is considered bad luck. Much the same, a squadron of bombers slipping through our air defenses would be simply catastrophic. It is why we must invest into researching at least basic air detection equipment for our forces, searchlights, AA guns and wire balloons."
 VED_Heavy_Air:0 "Heavy Air Doctrine"
 VED_Heavy_Air_desc:0 "In the skies, firepower is key. There is no reason to have a dozen tiny pea-shooters when we can just have one heavy-hitter able to cut through the skies like roaring thunder, too powerful to be taken down as it swats enemy fighters out of the sky like flies. Heavy fighters and bombers are key, and sacrificing speed for survivability, armour and better weaponry is something we're equipped to handle."
 VED_Navy_Destroyer:0 "The Navy Destroyers"
 VED_Navy_Destroyer_desc:0 "As our strength grows on land and in the air, it is imperative we secure our coast as well. If trade is the lifeblood of a country, then the oceans are its beating, pulsing heart, and it is imperative we protect this heart and not let it be used against us. Victory on the waters will easy translate to victory on land."
 VED_Air_Bases:0 "New Air Bases"
 VED_Air_Bases_desc:0 "Our air fleet can be the biggest in all of Griffonia, it won't matter if we won't have the airfields to support our planes. More runways, more fuel tanks, more pilot quarters, more strength in the air. And as wars become modern as well, strength in the air will be the difference between a heroic victory... or a shameful defeat."

 # Events
 vedina.1.t:0 "The Succession Crisis"
 vedina.1.d:0 "With the noble courts of Vedina growing restless, Wingstrom knows he must act soon to prevent a succession crisis. His young daughter Sköldsvärd must pass the traditional trials and prove her worth in three key areas.\n\nFirst, she must find a suitor and prove she can further her lineage. Next she must embark on a grand knightly quest and prove her valor and bravery. She must gather great deeds and victories to show to the nobility that she is ready to lead. Lastly, she must prove she can govern a state and improve Vedina as a whole.\n\nThe road will be long and arduous, but if she applies herself, Sköldsvärd can rise to become the greatest leader Vedina has ever seen."
 vedina.1.a:0 "We shall see."
 vedina.2.t:0 "Matters of Love"
 vedina.2.d:0 "Sköldsvärd realizes she has to marry a prince to gain respect in court. Having a consort, or at least a suitor, will help establish Sköldsvärd's position as heir and reassure the nobles that Vedina's line of succession will continue.\n\nAs such, Sköldsvärd agrees with her counselors to host a court session to allow suitors the ability to court her."
 vedina.2.a:0 "Here we go."
 vedina.3.t:0 "Sköldsvärd's First Day at Court"
 vedina.3.d:0 "During the first day at court, Sköldsvärd meets what seems like hundreds of suitors. They all seem to blur together into a mix of griffon faces. Three stand out, though.\n\nPrince Stridande, a proud aristocrat dressed in a striking military uniform. Prince Ondska, a dark-feathered griffon in a red cape. It's his almost... leering smirk that Sköldsvärd recalls the most.\n\nAnd of course, Prince Lycklig. Or... Princess Lycklig. The only griffoness to approach her.\n\nSköldsvärd suspects that these three will be the ones that will ask for her claw in matrimony."
 vedina.3.a:0 "Let's see if Sköldsvärd is right."
 vedina.4.t:0 "Prince Stridande Wishes To Court Sköldsvärd"
 vedina.4.d:0 "Dedicated to Princess Sköldsvärd, Stridande's letter is flowery, courteous and quite long. It is honestly a bit of a chore to read. On the other claw, towards the end of the letter, she notices that Stridande underlines a number of concerns about Vedina's military and some rather good ideas about how to improve it. It's a rather odd shift of tone for some griffon that seems to be a pure toff."
 vedina.4.a:0 "Maybe he has hidden depths?"
 vedina.5.t:0 "Prince Ondska Wishes To Court Sköldsvärd"
 vedina.5.d:0 "Ondska's letter compliments Sköldsvärd's beauty, intellect and strength, which is flattering, but rather straightforward. He also included a picture in his letter, which shows a dark-feathered griffon in a dashing blue-red jacket. He remarks that "together, we, the strong, can achieve anything". He also mentions though, that "those who oppose us, will simply have to fall in line" and that "change is coming to Vedina." "
 vedina.5.a:0 "What kind of change? And what does he mean by "fall in line?""
 vedina.6.t:0 "Princess Lycklig Wishes To Court Sköldsvärd"
 vedina.6.d:0 "Sköldsvärd finds Lycklig's letter the strangest to read, and not simply because it's a griffonness asking for her claw in courtship. On one claw, Lycklig seems to understand the weight on Sköldsvärd's shoulders, saying that if she becomes her consort, she'll do her best to "shoulder her responsibilities, and make you happy". But there's very little about why she would be the best consort, especially given that she is well, a she."
 vedina.6.a:0 "A bit of a mystery."
 vedina.7.t:0 "First Day at Court: A Summary"
 vedina.7.d:0 "Today, not one, but three princes (or well, two princes and a princess) have announced that they wish to court Sköldsvärd. Somehow she must now choose between the three of them. Luckily, as is the custom the princess must participate in some group event with her courtiers. She can get to know her suitors better during that time."
 vedina.7.a:0 "Who shall Sköldsvärd choose?"
 vedina.8.t:0 "The Hunt"
 vedina.8.d:0 "Sköldsvärd has chosen to participate in one of the most traditional practices of Vedinian nobility, a hunt! Of course, every one of her suitors has chosen to join the group made up of Vedina's nobles and their relatives. However, Sköldsvärd can only choose one suitor to accompany her personally, who shall she choose?"
 vedina.8.a:0 "Princess Lycklig."
 vedina.8.c:0 "Prince Ondska."
 vedina.8.b:0 "Prince Stridande."
 vedina.9.t:0 "Princess Lycklig Accompanies Sköldsvärd"
 vedina.9.d:0 "Lycklig is not a poor hunter, but she is disgusted by the sport. She expresses to Sköldsvärd that killing the poor animals who have done them no harm but by existing seems a poor waste of Vedina's natural resources and the talents of their best knights, especially given how most griffons in Vedina can't even afford meat."
 vedina.9.a:0 "She might have a point."
 vedina.10.t:0 "Prince Stridande Accompanies Sköldsvärd"
 vedina.10.d:0 "Stridande is a great hunter and gives good tips for Sköldsvärd about how to improve her hunting, but in whispers, so that she isn't embarrassed or condescended. Together, they bag two arctic foxes, all the while exchanging jokes."
 vedina.10.a:0 "A great time."
 vedina.11.t:0 "Prince Ondska Accompanies Sköldsvärd"
 vedina.11.d:0 "Ondska engages Sköldsvärd in a talk about the hunting that evolves into a discussion about the needs of the strong and of the weak. Ondska points that that given Vedina's limited resources and griffonpower, it only stands to reason that the most intelligent, the most strong, and the most physically able, should get the majority of the resources. During the hunt they spotted a winterchilla, which transformed into a huge winterzilla before their eyes as the sun set. Ondska shot and killed it, afterwards commenting how appearances can deceive and that even a small country such as Vedina has great power hidden within."
 vedina.11.a:0 "An interesting discussion."
 vedina.12.t:0 "After the Hunt"
 vedina.12.d:0 "After the hunt, the court sits down in a glen for a nice relaxing picnic. It's a beautiful day, though rather quiet. There are no birds. It's almost... too quiet.\n\nThe griffons hear some peculiar rustling sound coming from the bushes, followed by a growling noise."
 vedina.12.a:0 "IT'S AN BUGBEAR!"
 vedina.13.t:0 "Lycklig Reacts to the Bugbear"
 vedina.13.d:0 "Lycklig screams in horror, but after a moment's hesitation, she readies her weapon, and ushers the younger members of the party away, shielding them from the flying insectoid bear as best she can. She's clearly inexperienced with her weapon though, and utterly terrified."
 vedina.13.a:0 "Sköldsvärd glances to Stridande..."
 vedina.14.t:0 "Stridande Reacts to the Bugbear"
 vedina.14.d:0 "Stridande leaps up to fight the bugbear telling everybody to get back and fires his gun. He's shaking from adrenaline, so he misses his shot, but charges forward regardless screaming "For Vedina!" He is smacked aside by the beast for his trouble, but he didn't even hesitate for a second."
 vedina.14.a:0 "Readying her own weapon, Sköldsvärd looks to Ondska..."
 vedina.15.t:0 "Ondska Reacts to the Bugbear"
 vedina.15.d:0 "Ondska is nowhere to be found when the bugbear attacks, at least at first. After seeing Lycklig usher the younger members of the party away, Sköldsvärd does notice Ondska dive on the bear from above, hacking at it with his claws, screeching, "The strong will devour the weak and become stronger in return!" The bugbear claws at him and he manages to dodge the strikes, before circling up to a higher altitude with his wings."
 vedina.15.a:0 "It's Sköldsvärd's turn."
 vedina.16.t:0 "Princess Sköldsvärd Fights the Bugbear"
 vedina.16.d:0 "Sköldsvärd fires her rifle, hitting the bugbear, but the beast is somehow still moving. She draws her sword and swoops at it. It bats at her, but she dodges it's strike, and slashes at it's lower leg. She manages a hit, but it's gaining on her. With a cry, Sköldsvärd buries her blade with a perfect thrust into it's throat, silencing the creature. The nobles erupt in cheers."
 vedina.16.a:0 "The hunt ends, and what a hunt it was."
 vedina.17.t:0 "The Ball"
 vedina.17.d:0 "It's the start of the Ball! A less traditional Vedinian activity, but it's a fun way to blow off steam and mingle. But which prince shall Sköldsvärd ask to be her partner at the ball?"
 vedina.17.a:0 "Princess Lycklig."
 vedina.17.b:0 "Prince Stridande."
 vedina.17.c:0 "Prince Ondska."
 vedina.18.t:0 "Princess Lycklig Dances with Sköldsvärd"
 vedina.18.d:0 "Sköldsvärd takes Lycklig's claws and finds herself floating through the air, guided by a griffon who clearly enjoys dancing and knows how to do it. As they whirl through the hall, Lycklig brings up the subject of the commonfolk of Vedina and their mutters about how if only they could share in this wealth and entertainment. Sköldsvärd listens to Lycklig's ideas about how to bring Vedina out of poverty, many of which are quite well-supported. All the while, they twirl through the air in their own bubble. It's a informative, but intimate moment in time."
 vedina.18.a:0 "A great first dance, certainly."
 vedina.19.t:0 "Prince Stridande Dances with Sköldsvärd"
 vedina.19.d:0 "Surprisingly enough, Stridande is a very bad dancer. He nearly slams Sköldsvärd into the pillars of the dance hall several times. He does apologize profusely, listens to Sköldsvärd's instructions carefully and keeps trying his best. By the end of the dance, he's... less crash-prone, but by no means a good dancer."
 vedina.19.a:0 "At least he tried..."
 vedina.20.t:0 "Prince Ondska Dances with Sköldsvärd"
 vedina.20.d:0 "The prince is striking in his black jacket and decorative pointed steel helmet. His dancing leaves a bit to be desired as he's a bit stiff and prefers to take the lead, but he is competent. As they waltz through the air, he asks if Sköldsvärd has heard of the old myths about the dark magicians. She responds that she has, and when she does, his eyes light up. He muses on how they brought their wielders such power and strength that all feared them, and asks Sköldsvärd if it would be nice for Vedina to be feared for a change, instead of being trampled down by the Griffonian Empire. "After all," he points out, "the Empire is experiencing a period of resurgence. We can industrialize and reform all we want, but can we do so fast enough?" When Sköldsvärd doesn't respond, he says in an off-clawed manner, that he doesn't mean to say that Vedina should immediately embrace... more questionable magic, but that considering how Equestria has magic, the Griffonian Empire has population and industry, they should definitely look at... different ways to apply magic so that they can survive. In this, he seems quite sincere in his belief."
 vedina.20.a:0 "Was he really here to dance...?"
 vedina.21.t:0 "After the First Dance"
 vedina.21.d:0 "The first dance is finished! Now, time to relax, mingle with all the suitors and enjoy snacks served in the grand halls of the palace."
 vedina.21.a:0 "Onward!"
 vedina.22.t:0 "Sköldsvärd's Conversation With Ondska"
 vedina.22.d:0 "Ondska takes Sköldsvärd aside to have a quiet conversation. Sköldsvärd listens to him talk about the dangers of Vedina being so weak in the face of the power of the Griffonian Empire. He has a point, but there's an odd light that flickers in his eyes as he goes on and on about how it might makes right, and the weak's destiny is to be subsumed by the strong."
 vedina.22.a:0 "Okay..."
 vedina.23.t:0 "Sköldsvärd's Drink With Stridande"
 vedina.23.d:0 "Stridande pulls Sköldsvärd over after her first dance, treating her to a drink. He compliments her on her beauty, and grace, but oddly enough, he also makes a few biting jokes at the expense of some of the attendees. Like how "Countess Räkmacka sends her children to private school, yet she is trying to pay her way to be appointed Minister of Education!" He's clearly got strong opinions about the state of Vedinian nobility."
 vedina.23.a:0 "Hmm..."
 vedina.24.t:0 "Lycklig Dances With Sköldsvärd"
 vedina.24.d:0 "Lycklig asks Sköldsvärd for her second dance, and she accepts. They whirl through the ballroom, finding themselves perfectly in sync as they speed up. Lycklig is thoroughly and sincerely reveling the dance and doing her best to try to make sure Sköldsvärd enjoys the dance as well. She frequently and rightfully compliments Sköldsvärd on how much work she has put into appearing the perfect princess."
 vedina.24.a:0 "That was nice, wasn't it?"
 vedina.25.t:0 "A Successful Ball"
 vedina.25.d:0 "It's been a nice night, with dancing, revelry and, above all, interesting company. There will be opportunities to get to know the other suitors later, but for now, everyone is heading home to sleep."
 vedina.25.a:0 "What next?"
 vedina.26.t:0 "The Feast"
 vedina.26.d:0 "Feasting is a Vedinian tradition about as old as hunting, and thus, an excellent time to enjoy good food, some performers doing acrobatics and singing in the background, and good company. Who shall Sköldsvärd seat next to her?"
 vedina.26.a:0 "Princess Lycklig."
 vedina.26.b:0 "Prince Stridande."
 vedina.26.c:0 "Prince Ondska."
 vedina.27.t:0 "Princess Lycklig Sits with Sköldsvärd"
 vedina.27.d:0 "Instead of making Lycklig eager to eat, the opulence of the feast seems to annoy the princess. She eats the food almost... guiltily, as if she doesn't to eat it. Sköldsvärd presses Lycklig as to why, which is when Lycklig spits out that a poor Vedinian family can't even afford the plate that this food is being served on. She tells Sköldsvärd that she appreciates her hospitality, but for the sake of the Vedinian griffons, she will only eat until she is full, and will not gorge herself."
 vedina.27.a:0 "At least she's not wasting food."
 vedina.28.t:0 "Prince Stridande Sits with Sköldsvärd"
 vedina.28.d:0 "Stridande grumbles about how the food isn't as good as the rations in the Griffonian Empire. He wonders openly if some noble lord or lady's swindled the best ingredients from the Royal Kitchen and replaced them with second-rate ingredients. He asks Sköldsvärd if the Vedinian noble families will ever fulfill the roles they were sworn to."
 vedina.28.a:0 "Huh..."
 vedina.29.t:0 "Prince Ondska Sits with Sköldsvärd"
 vedina.29.d:0 "Ondska is very happy to sit next to Sköldsvärd. He muses that the view from the table head must look rather interesting. But he also points to Sköldsvärd that a number of her nobles are very much playing their own game, and clearly wary of her.\n\n"Wouldn't it be nice to have all of them love you? To have it so that they only desire to serve you?" He explains that if Vedina is to be protected from aggression and to come to her own on the world stage, they need to be united as a military state, where all must serve for the country's benefit. They would all be guided by one strong ruler.\n\nWhen Sköldsvärd asks about the consequences of such militarization and centralization Ondska shrugs.\n\n"The strong devour the weak in this world, Princess, and I know you have the ability to do what's necessary.""
 vedina.29.a:0 "Hmm..."
 vedina.30.t:0 "After the Feasting"
 vedina.30.d:0 "Now that she's full, it's time for Sköldsvärd to mingle with the suitors. There's some entertainment in the form of a band of musicians and some accompanying performers."
 vedina.30.a:0 "How's Stridande doing?"
 vedina.31.t:0 "Prince Stridande Comments on the Feast"
 vedina.31.d:0 "Stridande comments that the entertainment is alright, but that the performers don't seem to be doing it happily. He suspects that they aren't being paid in full and laments to Sköldsvärd that the nobility no longer sponsors the arts, and rather tries to cheat artists out of their hard-earned cash with fine print."
 vedina.31.a:0 "So how is Prince Ondska doing?"
 vedina.32.t:0 "Prince Ondska Makes Some Comments"
 vedina.32.d:0 "Ondska is looking at a stained glass window dedicated to the Wise Lady, and showing the first king, Förena, being given guidance. He mutters that if she was so wise, why didn't she push the king to expand eastward.\n\nSeeing Sköldsvärd, he smiles and points out that it's rather impressive that the Wise Lady is worshipped even today and that her influence is so widespread.\n\nHe seems disapproving of the Wise Lady, though, and when Sköldsvärd inquires, he grimaces and says the fact she only provided guidance has led to Vedina being in this position. If she was an active god who would lead, and exerted her power and wisdom to rule Vedina, then they wouldn't have been subjugated by the Griffonian Empire."
 vedina.32.a:0 "Okay, how is Princess Lycklig doing?"
 vedina.33.t:0 "Princess Lycklig Comments on Wine"
 vedina.33.d:0 "Sköldsvärd walks by Lycklig, noticing that she doesn't seem to like the drink and mutters something about how most griffons taste alcohol but once in their life. It's an odd comment given that she does finish her drink and greets Sköldsvärd with a winning smile, complimenting her on her dress. Sköldsvärd asks Lycklig if what she says is true. Surprised, Lycklig says yes, explaining how the nobles hold a stranglehold on wine."
 vedina.33.a:0 "Hmm."
 vedina.34.t:0 "Feast Over"
 vedina.34.d:0 "All in all, a successful feast. There will be time to mingle further with the suitors, but at least Sköldsvärd has a sense of who the suitors are."
 vedina.34.a:0 "Now, what next?"
 vedina.35.t:0 "A Night Out"
 vedina.35.d:0 "Sköldsvärd decides to have a night out with one of her suitors. But whom to choose?"
 vedina.35.a:0 "Prince Ondska."
 vedina.35.b:0 "Prince Stridande."
 vedina.35.c:0 "Princess Lycklig."
 vedina.36.t:0 "Sköldsvärd and Prince Ondska's Night Out"
 vedina.36.d:0 "The place Ondska takes Sköldsvärd is a quiet temple to the Wise Lady, far from the city. It's a marvel of old Vedinian architecture and it's got this tranquil atmosphere to it.\n\nAt least at first glance, as Sköldsvärd and Ondska enter deeper in, the mood changes. Something's off about this temple. The end of it has the typical statue of the Wise Lady, but that seems diminished and compared to the statues of the massive griffons that flank her.\n\nOndska, who had been talking going on about how the precursors to the First Lady had magical abilities despite the fact they were griffons, falls silent. He tells of Sköldsvärd that if she's noticed something odd about this temple, then she has good senses, because the temple isn't one to the Wise Lady.\n\nOndska taps the wall too the left of the statue of the Wise Lady and pushes a block of stone, along with the wall. It rotates with a groan. Ondska walks, grinning widely and Sköldsvärd follows him, slowly. The circular chamber beyond is some kind of old ritual chamber with stains and carvings on the floor. As Sköldsvärd narrows her eyes, she realizes they are strange runes, which she vaguely remembers seeing in some old tome about ancient runic magic.\n\nOndska explains that this was where the ancients who predated the Wise Lady used to summon and create contracts with creatures from beyond, which allowed them to wield powers despite their griffon heritage. Sköldsvärd asks for clarification and Ondska says that the creatures tend to be misunderstood as purely evil demons. "They're more demanding than evil. They follow their contracts to the letter, which foolish summoners tend to forget, and wise summoners always remember." He points out though that the powers bestowed upon by the creatures could allow their masters to perform feats only dreamt of. The pictures and murals on the walls of the chambers seem to attest to this, as they show griffons leading armies into battle, and casting spells that devastate their pony or griffon enemies."

 vedina.37.t:0 "Sköldsvärd and Prince Stridande's Night Out"
 vedina.37.d:0 "Stridande asks Sköldsvärd to wear a disguise, and takes her into Turhamn. There they have a great time dancing in the "Brass Galleon" bar and there's a lot of interesting company. Many of the bar's customers are Vedina-born young military officers, who grumble at how the nobility keeps cutting their budget and how tradition rather than innovation seems to be the call of the day. They're also excellent comedians who take care to make the disguised Stridande and Sköldsvärd comfortable and included."
 vedina.37.a:0 "Well, that was fun?"
 vedina.38.t:0 "Princess Lycklig and Sköldsvärd have a Night Out"
 vedina.38.d:0 "Lycklig takes Sköldsvärd - who goes in disguise - to a salon club with a group of other griffonesses. Most from Vedina, but a few from Nova Griffonia and some hailing from as far as the Evi Valley. They engage in a concerted discussion about the wealth gap between the poor and rich and how it ends up hurting both. Some of them have quite outlandish ideas, but Lycklig, who is presenting, puts forward a rather conservative plan that supports gradual development, with the adjustment of Vedinian traditions to accommodate a modern world. After the salon is finished, Lycklig invites Sköldsvärd to ask questions about her plan, which Sköldsvärd does, and they continue to discuss Vedina's economy into the night.\n\nSköldsvärd does have one big question though, how will Lycklig provide her with an heir? Lycklig counters with, "provide you with an heir, why, can it not be the other way around?"\n\nLycklig then laughs and explains that there are plenty of children who lack parents of their own, and who'd make excellent successors given proper love and care. Blood isn't the only way griffons can be connected, after all."
 vedina.38.a:0 "Oh..."
 vedina.39.t:0 "A Walk in the Garden"
 vedina.39.d:0 "Sköldsvärd decides to go for a quiet walk in the Royal Garden in Turhamn with one of her suitors. But whom to choose?"
 vedina.39.a:0 "Prince Ondska."
 vedina.39.b:0 "Prince Stridande."
 vedina.39.c:0 "Princess Lycklig."
 vedina.40.t:0 "Sköldsvärd and Ondska's Walk"
 vedina.40.d:0 "Ondska seems almost disdainful of the flowers of the gardens. Most of the time he keeps talking about how Vedina must abandon the idea of trying to provide for every griffon, and focus on providing as much resources as possible for those actually able to make a difference. Occasionally, he points to the odd spider or predatory insect that he and Sköldsvärd run into and uses them as an example the possibility of what might happen to Vedina; it's fall or it's rise."
 vedina.40.a:0 "A good walk?"
 vedina.41.t:0 "Sköldsvärd and Stridande's Walk"
 vedina.41.d:0 "During their walk in the Stridande confides in Sköldsvärd about his worry about the nobility of Vedina and how they've forgotten their duty. Stridande and Sköldsvärd also talk about their favorite legends and old heroes from Vedina's past. They both admire King Förena, but find that they have a common adoration of "The Wise Lady" in Vedina's history."
 vedina.41.a:0 "Good enough."
 vedina.42.t:0 "Sköldsvärd and Lycklig's Walk"
 vedina.42.d:0 "Lycklig finds the gardens peaceful, and says as much to Sköldsvärd, but she seems to be rather saddened by them. Sköldsvärd wonders why and presses Lycklig, until she asks "Why does such beauty has to be only for the rich? Can we not have parks, and public gardens, where children, and the elderly of all classes can play together? Can share ideas and remember that they are all from Vedina?"\n\nSköldsvärd questions Lycklig why she is so concerned and asking this question. Lycklig is silent.\n\n"Because I am an illegitimate child."\n\nHer father had no other heirs though, and so was forced to legitimize her. She thus wants change because she can really feel for the common griffon as she has seen and experienced a poor childhood herself, and isn't going to let her good fortune go to waste. She tells Sköldsvärd that, "If you choose me, I will make sure no Vedinian child grows up hungry, and glaring with hate at the nobility who tax them. I will bring Vedina into the modern world as your right claw.""

 vedina.43.t:0 "The Dinner"
 vedina.43.d:0 "A private dinner in the Royal Castle is a great way for Sköldsvärd to spend time with one of her suitors. But who shall Sköldsvärd pick?"

 vedina.43.c:0 "Princess Lycklig."
 vedina.44.t:0 "Sköldsvärd and Ondska Have Dinner"
 vedina.44.d:0 "The Prince is pulling a full charm offensive, of sorts. Ondska is certainly attempting to be suave.\n\nHowever, his flirting compliments tend to be along the lines of, "You know, things would run so much smoother if you were the only power in Vedina." Or, "The Kingdom should trust griffons like you more, rather than the law." And "What do the peasants know of how to rule? Only you, and I of course, know anything of ruling.""
 vedina.44.a:0 "At least he's trying?"
 vedina.45.t:0 "Sköldsvärd and Stridande Have Dinner"
 vedina.45.d:0 "Stridande is an excellent conversationalist, regaling Sköldsvärd about his stories in the Griffonian Empire and during training. Toward the end of the dinner, Sköldsvärd and Stridande also get into a discussion about how to apply Vedina's traditions in a modern world, and its role in a modern world. In the end, Stridande states that he thinks that chivalry still has a place, and mentions that no matter who Sköldsvärd chooses, he'll always be loyal to Vedina, as is his role."
 vedina.45.a:0 "Huh, that seems very good of him?"
 vedina.46.t:0 "Sköldsvärd and Lycklig Have Dinner"
 vedina.46.d:0 "Lycklig makes the dinner herself and is a surprisingly good cook. It's a very romantic atmosphere and Lycklig is very willing to listen to Sköldsvärd complain about the outdated and weird tradition of dangerous trials for heirs, whilst also cracking a few jokes at her own expense, and at the expense of some of the more stuffy Vedinian nobility. It's a relaxing evening and Lycklig finishes it by serving dessert and dancing with Sköldsvärd to the music of the gramophone."
 vedina.46.a:0 "A most wonderful evening."
 vedina.47.t:0 "The Love Letters"
 vedina.47.d:0 "Having spent some time with all of her suitors, Sköldsvärd is coming close to the point to where she can make a decision. But before she does, three love letters from the three suitors arrive for her."
 vedina.47.a:0 "Time to open them."
 vedina.48.t:0 "Princess Lycklig's Letter"
 vedina.48.d:0 "Lycklig makes the argument that they seem to get along, that unlike the other suitors, they can relate to each other thanks to their gender and that Sköldsvärd needs help to bring Vedina into the future, not back into the past. Having an heir will not be a challenge, given the choice of adoption. \n\nThe crux of her letter is towards its end, where she concedes that she might not have gotten Sköldsvärd to love her yet. She writes though that regardless, she will be the queen-consort that will help Sköldsvärd lead Vedina to not to militarization, not to whatever insanity that Ondska might be planning, but to the uncertain future, or the "undiscovered country" as Lycklig calls it."
 vedina.48.a:0 "Okay. What did Prince Stridande write?"
 vedina.49.t:0 "Prince Stridande's Letter"
 vedina.49.d:0 "In the love letter, Stridande plays down his status and emphasizes not his wealth, but his chivalry, stating that no matter who Sköldsvärd chooses, he'll respect her choice. What he does want is to serve and he thinks he can best serve as her consort, to help remind the nobility of their old roles, and to help her make Vedina the bastion of chivalry that they used to be."
 vedina.49.a:0 "Okay. What did Prince Ondska write?"
 vedina.50.t:0 "Prince Ondska's Letter"
 vedina.50.d:0 "Ondska says that he's not just a good choice, he is the only choice if Sköldsvärd is to rule supreme over Vedina, crushing her enemies underneath her claws and vanquishing dissent. He claims that if she chooses him, he would help her lead Vedina to become the strongest power on the continent."
 vedina.50.a:0 "Hmm."
 vedina.52.t:0 "Assessing the Situation"
 vedina.52.d:0 "Vedina has problems both within and without, as [Root.GetLeader] well knows by now. The economy is behind the times, the military is not quite up to the standards of more modernized nations, and more than these things Vedina's position in the political stage is uncertain. With the Emperor's death, we can breathe more freely. But we cannot yet stand alone.\n\nThe main allies we could seek to maintain our relative independence are Aquileia to the south, and our neighbors in the Griffonian Republic. Both are stalwart in their resistance to any Imperial resurgence, and both could potentially stand firm against Imperial renewal. Aquileia and its Entente would better suit our harmonic ideals, but the Griffonian Republic would be easier to coordinate our defences. We must choose, quickly but not without wisdom."
 vedina.52.a:0 "Who to befriend?"
 vedina.53.t:0 "Courting the Entente"
 vedina.53.d:0 "Sköldsvärd approaches the Republic through intermediaries, looking for them to make good on the proposed Entente. There is some mild tension between us. The Republicans are suspicious of any monarch, and we are a bit dismayed by the more radical in their ranks. But we are united by our harmonic ideals, and by our distrust of the expansionist Empire.\n\nPreliminary negotiations set a time and a place for a royal visit, but it is up to [Root.GetLeader] to seal the deal. We cannot offer tanks or planes, but we can offer knights of superb quality and skill. The monarch sits across a table from an elected leader, their aides on either side, and Sköldsvärd decides to let some of her guard down. If she is to overcome their distrust of her status, she must show the Republicans that she is a griffon same as they are despite her estate, and that they are closer than it would appear. She talks freely, letting herself gush about the beautiful sights of the capitol, and of her hope for friendship between two nations. But will it win them over?"
 vedina.53.a:0 "Cross your talons..."
 vedina.54.t:0 "A Proposal"
 vedina.54.d:0 "[JER.GetLeader], President of the Republic, is cordial despite his people's misgivings. After the preliminary meeting, he takes his leave and invites Sköldsvärd and her retinue to a reception. She accepts happily, expressing her excitement to finally try a taste of the famed Aquileian cuisine.\n\nAt the reception full of diplomats, generals, and rich financiers of the democratic cause, Sköldsvärd is absolutely radiant. She carefully chose an outfit more suited for the republican tastes, beautiful but not obscenely ornate. The ladies talk in glowing terms, and every bachelor in the room follows her with his eyes. Her every word is listened to with rapt attention and her every action watched.\n\nThe next few days brings another battery of meetings. Vedina's harmonist sentiment is not in question, but its monarchy is still hard to swallow. [JER.GetLeader] asks if he may send a delegation to see what Vedina is like for himself, and the monarch readily agrees. Talk turns to what Vedina can offer the Entente in terms of griffonpower and material. Afterwards, Sköldsvärd returns to her chambers feeling glum. Has she done enough? [JER.GetLeader] hasn't cracked a smile since she arrived..."
 vedina.54.a:0 "The answer comes soon..."
 vedina.55.t:0 "Vedina Joins the Entente"
 vedina.55.d:0 "The next day, Sköldsvärd returns to the conference room to meet a smiling but bleary-eyed President. "Congratulations," he says, extending a claw. "For better or worse, I am here to offer our decision."\n\nThe baffled monarch looks down at it. "What do you mean, my good griffon?" she asks.\n\n"While you were sleeping, Highness, my cabinet spent the whole night in debate. I will be honest with you and say that Vedina is not a partner that we looked for, but perhaps it is one that we needed. The finer points of our cooperation need to be ironed out, but the Entente and the Republic welcomes you into our fold."\n\nAn elated Sköldsvärd takes his claw and shakes it happily, startling the more formal among her retinue. She may be royal, but she is after everything still a griffon, and a young one at that. All of her hard work, her worries, and the future of her nature hanging over her, and for the first time in ages she feels like she can breathe."
 vedina.55.a:0 "A good day for Vedina and harmony!"
 vedina.56.t:0 "Vedina is Judged Unworthy"
 vedina.56.d:0 "President [JER.GetLeader] had been distant for her whole visit, but today he just seemed grim. Sköldsvärd sat down as she had several times, and noticed that he did not speak at all right away.\n\n"I have unfortunate news," he said suddenly, startling her. "Your Highness, I confess that I had hoped that the Republic could aid you. I am sworn enemy of royalty, but griffon to griffon, I like you. But the Republic cannot afford to tie itself to a backwards nation, especially one under a royal yoke. The Empire's threat is too great, and the world is too dangerous for such sentimentality. I am sorry. The cabinet and the people's assemblies have spoken, and with a heavy heart, I must ask you to and your retinue to leave." He rose stiffly, and bowed before leaving a stunned royal behind him."
 vedina.56.a:0 "We leave with heavy hearts."
 vedina.57.t:0 "The Griffon Alliance"
 vedina.57.d:0 "Rather than chance our luck with the Aquileians, whose hatred of monarchs is still fresh, let us approach the remnants of the first Republic, the one that rose in Griffenheim. If anyone will be a stalwart ally in the fight against the Empire, it would be those whose hatred of our former masters has forged them into a nation. Their alliance is less sure, as these Republicans have fewer potential friends and are far less stable.\n\nHowever, the Republican griffons are close by, and coordinating our military efforts should be a bit easier. Unlike Aquelia, the northern republic has more immediate need of friends, and cannot afford to be as picky."
 vedina.57.a:0 "Let us go with open minds."
 vedina.58.t:0 "Courting the Republic"
 vedina.58.d:0 "[Root.GetLeader] arrived in Cloudbury today to much pomp and circumstance. But to be truthful, her visit has already proved a bit disappointing. Cloudbury is a fine city, but its people do not look hopeful or enthusiastic about anything, let alone such an important alliance. The Republicans have a lot of problems, and it shows. Outside of Cloudbury, the griffons of the country do not necessarily like or trust the government of the city. The army is a unruly at best, and mutinous at worst. Her reports emphasized the precarious nature of the Republic, even as [FAT.GetLeader] works tirelessly.\n\nBut Sköldsvärd still hopes. [FAT.GetLeader] is a shrewd griffon, and she's sure that he will see the advantages of having Vedina's corps of knights backing up his army."
 vedina.58.a:0 "We await their final decision."
 vedina.59.t:0 "Vedina Joins the Alliance"
 vedina.59.d:0 "[FAT.GetLeader] and Sköldsvärd converse long into the night, and even more the next day. He is a pragmatic griffon, and she finds him charming in a gruff sort of way. He's a veteran of both war and political disaster, and while he has sympathy for her harmonist outlook, he refuses to be tied down to it.\n\nEventually, they reach an accord. Vedina and the republicans will stand together against the Empire. It's high time that these warmongering conquerors meet their end!"
 vedina.59.a:0 "Brothers in arms!"
 vedina.60.t:0 "Vedina Shown the Door"
 vedina.60.d:0 "[FAT.GetLeader] is a hard griffon. He's seen too many dewy-eyed idealists die, and had to order the deaths of at least some of them. His life has become a quest to restore the republic, and he will stop at nothing. He is cordial to Vedina's lady, but as talks go on he seems more and more unimpressed with our military capability. Our lack of modern technology, our reliance on knights, and the state of our economy at last prompt him to quip that we've asked him to tie himself to a country with all of the problems he has, but worse.\n\nEventually, Sköldsvärd must concede defeat. The Republic is too embittered, too fragile, too desperate, and too stubborn to see the error of their ways. [FAT.GetLeader] and his government cannot be reasoned with. We can only hope that they aren't destroyed by the Empire."
 vedina.60.a:0 "Frustrating."
 vedina.61.t:0 "Looking Across the Sea"
 vedina.61.d:0 "It was the Empire who colonized Nova Griffonia, not Vedina. But we have maintained cordial relationships, if not close ones, with our cousins across the sea. Our ways are very different, but perhaps some common ground can be found between us. We both live in troubled times, and we are both vulnerable to the machinations of other more powerful and more modernized nations.\n\nA royal visit is out of the question, as the colony is far too wild for that. But a noble diplomatic mission has been dispatched looking for an accord between us. The gulf between us does limit how useful we can be to each other, that is true, but our knights would be welcome on the frontier, and their brave militagriffs would be a boon for us here on the frontlines of the next war on Griffonia."
 vedina.61.a:0 "Will they help us?"
 vedina.62.t:0 "The Colonists Agree!"
 vedina.62.d:0 "Good news from Equus! Word comes from our mission to Weter that the colonists have heard the cry of their cousins in Griffonia, and have decided to side with us. What exactly that looks like is yet to be determined, but unless talking out the specifics completely breaks down, we have a sure friend in Nova Griffonia. In such troubled times, any friend is a good friend."
 vedina.62.a:0 "Brothers in arms!"
 vedina.63.t:0 "Nova Griffonian Refusal"
 vedina.63.d:0 "Our dignitaries have come home with hats in claws and ill news. Nova Griffonia simply does not have what we seek. Not only that, but those rubes turned our party away after only a few days! Apparently they have "bigger problems" on Equus, which is frankly ridiculous. Changelings or yaks or whatever else, are they not griffons? Nova Griffonia was a mistake, really, creating griffons with no idea about real griffon problems and concerns! By the gods, they're hardly even griffons anymore!"
 vedina.63.a:0 "That is ill news indeed."
 vedina.64.t:0 "An Unfortunate Truth"
 vedina.64.d:0 "There are very few griffons in Vedina who want to return to our old place in the shadow of the Empire. Whilst in our protectorate the Empire rarely truly oppressed us, it also kept us feeble and nonthreatening. Our culture was being erased slowly, yes. Our country itself was being eaten away. But it does not need to be that way.\n\nThe emperor is dead, and with him dies the old ways and the old ideas. Vedina has an opportunity now to redefine its relationship to Griffenheim. A Vedina that comes back to the Empire of its own accord can return not as a puppet but as a valued friend and junior partner. With some luck and shrewdness, we can survive. There's nowhere else to turn, in the end. Only the Empire endures."
 vedina.64.a:0 "Perhaps it is for the best."
 vedina.65.t:0 "Crawling Back to the Empire"
 vedina.65.d:0 "Vedina has sent a somber delegation to the Imperial capitol to negotiate our return. The Imperial officials were surprised, to say the least, that we didn't cut and run. We are not sure what they will make of poor Vedina. We are far from the seat of power, and surrounded by nations which are not friendly to the old order. We ourselves have at times been unfriendly to it, and they will not forget this. We can offer them our knights, though they are poorly equipped in this day and age. Our economy, our weak industry, our remoteness... These things all count against us. Loyalty and knights were enough to buy imperial protection a few hundred years ago. We hope it will be enough to buy it now."
 vedina.65.a:0 "We await their decision."
 vedina.66.t:0 "Better Safe Then Brave"
 vedina.66.d:0 "Vedina has always prized itself on honour. We have talked chivalry and courage into the ground, and take great pride in our traditions. But wisdom is also a virtue, and part of being a good knight is making the most of your strengths for a good cause. Few love the Empire, but they can see the wisdom in picking the devil you know. It might not be the bravest, but it is probably the safest course of action to hitch our star to the rising star of the Regent. Especially now that we have assurances that the Imperials will keep their claws off our culture and our society, perhaps we can help push them towards a better and more honorable course. Who knows? At best Vedina can help stabilize the continent. At worse, we'll be safe from our neighbors and a rapidly changing world. Long live the Empire! For better or worse."
 vedina.66.a:0 "Vedina is loyal again."
 vedina.67.t:0 "The Imperial Refusal"
 vedina.67.d:0 "There are moments that leave entire countries temporarily paralyzed, and this is one of them. Nobles in Turhamn sit in stunned silence, struggling to understand how everything could have fallen apart. The merchants have closed their shops. The peasants, even, have begun to worry about what the future holds.\n\nThe Imperial response to our petition is an open letter posted through Vedina which advises our benighted land to "look to your own defenses" and wishes us luck, but also officially cuts all ties between us. Not only will they spare no resources to preserve their protectorate, but in fact if they win out from the host of dangers assailing them then we may one day have an imperial army at our door. Times are bleak, and if even the Empire won't take us back, can we find friends elsewhere?"
 vedina.67.a:0 "We're doomed..."
 vedina.68.t:0 "Vedina Stands Alone"
 vedina.68.d:0 "We cannot trust the republicans, with their strange new ideas. We cannot go back to the Empire, for many reasons. The colonists cannot be trusted to be useful. The ponies certainly won't be our friends. We are alone and beset on all sides by, if not foes, then potential foes. Everygriff sharpens their talons and swords, and young peasants practice with bayonet and pistol knowing that all too soon they will need them. Who can say what shall come? But whatever it is, Vedina and its griffons will not fare well without the Lady's blessing and a heap of luck."
 vedina.68.a:0 "Look to our own defenses."
 vedina.69.t:0 "Rogue's Gallery of Friends"
 vedina.69.d:0 "Now that we've let go of our more naive ideals, it's time to look abroad and assess the situation. As much as we'd all like to deny it, Vedina is not as strong as it could be in this new world. We lag behind in technology, if not in valor, and our economy is still outdated and inefficient.\n\nThere are a few likeminded nations who share our ideology of strength whom we may align ourselves with for the time being. We could seek an arrangement with the Archons, who while not quite what we have in mind are fellow travelers. While not quite what we have in mind, the Archon is something of a fellow traveler. The griffons across the sea might also be worth investigating, if we can find sympathizers who share our view of the strong and the weak.\n\nOr, if we must, we could go it alone. With time, we could perhaps form a coalition of nations based around ourselves?"
 vedina.69.a:0 "Partner with the Empire!"
 vedina.69.b:0 "The Colonists it is."
 vedina.69.c:0 "We'll start our own alliance!"
 vedina.70.t:0 "Proposing an Alliance"
 vedina.70.d:0 "Now that we've figured out who exactly we need as our friend and ally in troubled times, next comes properly impressing them. It has been decided that the royals will go, of course, but accompanied with the most advanced military honor guard we can muster. No expense shall be spared. It is unnecessarily showy, yes, but it will get the job done.\n\nWe can only hope that our investment will pay off. Vedina needs allies, and it needs them soon. The republicans could gather their strength any day now, and until we have friends opportunists all down the coast count us as a soft target. Let us hope we make a good impression. The first step to being truly strong is surviving long enough to better yourself."
 vedina.70.a:0 "What will their answer be?"
 vedina.71.t:0 "They Agree!"
 vedina.71.d:0 "Joyous news from abroad! Our now partners have agreed to our proposed alliance. While perhaps these are not the best terms --they have been somewhat dodgy on the question of just how much support they are willing to provide in the case of war-- the minimum guarentees have satisfied our rulers. Vedina shall have its alliance, and with friends comes the security to modernize fully."
 vedina.71.a:0 "Brothers in arms!"
 vedina.72.t:0 "Vedina is Rebuffed!"
 vedina.72.d:0 "Another bleak day in what seems like a bleak time. Our embassy has been sent packing. The royals and their honor guard were not as impressive as we'd hoped, and now we have lost the opportunity to form a potentially valuable alliance.\n\nThe mood back home is sour. The nobles and knightly ranks talk as they always have, and a few have put forth the idea that perhaps our lovely rulers are not quite cut out for the job of representing the Kingdom abroad. Most of the elites are still loyal, of course, but it is telling that after an initial acceptance of the new order, there are cracks beginning to show. The former princess and her consort are not as loved as they would perhaps have liked... for now. But that will change. This is only a setback."
 vedina.72.a:0 "We'll show them..."
 vedina.73.t:0 "An Invitation From [From.Capital.GetName]"
 vedina.73.d:0 "A note with the royal seal arrives in our chosen ally's capitol intended for the eyes of only their highest officials. It contains wild promises, and honestly comes across as a bit... keen. But there's certainly a degree of charismatic charm as well. Vedina does not invite just about anyone to its league, after all. There is some honor in that selectivity!\n\nOnly one question. Will they accept, and join our League?"
 vedina.73.a:0 "Yes!"
 vedina.73.b:0 "The League of What now?"
 vedina.74.t:0 "Another Joins the League!"
 vedina.74.d:0 "Success! After some deliberation, we have gained a valued friend. The exchanging of gifts, advisors, and officials is already being negotiated, and soon comes joint military planning.\n\nThis is, of course, not the end. The league must grow, and Vedina's ambitions do not end at just acquiring a friend or two. No, we dream far bigger. This is but the first step, and these fools are just a stepping stone on the Kingdom's road to eventual empire."
 vedina.74.a:0 "Glory to Vedina!"
 vedina.75.t:0 "Made a Mockery"
 vedina.75.d:0 "These disgusting fools that we offered our friendship to have thrown the invitation away. Clearly we overestimated them.\n\nWhile no one says anything at court, there are whispers being traded noble to noble. Perhaps all of this talk of the Rights of the Strong and the Duties of the Weak was for show. Perhaps. Such is the danger of talking about oneself in terms of strength in an ideology of absolutes."

 vedina_quest.2.d:0 "A refreshing drink and a few smiles later and the Princess had herself a rather informative discussion with the bartender, who offered her a room for a low price.\n\nIt turns out that the village had been under the thumb of a dragon for a while, having to sacrifice its wealth to it on a regular basis. Why had it not been reported, simple, the local noble lord was corrupt and cared little for their plight. Sköldsvärd thought that fighting a dragon and slaying it would certainly impress the court, but would also be extremely dangerous."
 vedina_quest.2.a:0 "A dragon, eh?"
 vedina_quest.3.t:0 "A Good Night's Rest"
 vedina_quest.3.d:0 "There is nothing quite like a good night's rest, and Sköldsvärd has now found herself quite well rested, eager to take on whatever challenge befalls the village. It has given her time to reflect, and she had decided she should ask the locals."
 vedina_quest.3.a:0 "Perfect."
 vedina_quest.4.t:0 "A Dragon?!"
 vedina_quest.4.d:0 "It was a dragon. A dragon had taken up residence in the nearby mountain and was extorting the village of its riches. A vile injustice indeed. Sköldsvärd needed to deal with this, and thus she vowed to vanquish it.\n\nSuch a thing would not be easy. She would need assistance to fell such a beast, but from who?"
 vedina_quest.4.a:0 "The local knights!"
 vedina_quest.4.b:0 "A bigger gun is all the assitance she needs."
 vedina_quest.4.c:0 "The people must defend themselves!"
 vedina_quest.5.t:0 "The Knights"
 vedina_quest.5.d:0 "A small and effective force of Vedinian's finest live in the area, owning several farms and serving the local lord and the crown loyally. It would be foolish not to utilise them. After a quick visit, they are happy to assist the Princess in whatever way she needs.\n\nOf course, proper preparation is sometimes key, but it may be better to deal with this quickly. Sköldsvärd can spend time forming a proper plan, or she can take what she has and hope for the best. What is her decision?"
 vedina_quest.5.a:0 "Let's play this smart."
 vedina_quest.5.b:0 "Charge!"
 vedina_quest.6.t:0 "Poison?"
 vedina_quest.6.d:0 "The knigthly quartermaster has done his research, and has found an old monster hunting manual dating back several hundred years in his small library. Apparently there is a substance which can be made from simple herbs which will prove very poisonous to dragons. It won't kill one, but enough to give the Princess and her knights an edge.\n\nStill, isn't such an advantage a dishonourable one?"
 vedina_quest.6.a:0 "Use it!"
 vedina_quest.6.b:0 "We can do without."
 vedina_quest.7.t:0 "Victory!"
 vedina_quest.7.d:0 "The brave knights charged forth with the Princess at their head, dashing into the ancient lair of the dragon. There a heated battle erupted, quickly silencing the ancient dragon in the mountain. It put up a good fight, but armed with poisoned weapons and a determination to defend their country, the attackers defeated the greedy dragon. The killing blow was dealt by the Princess herself and the dragon's treasure hoard has been seized and returned to the peaceful village. A victory for liberty, and for Vedina, and for the Princess who has proved her valor in battle."
 vedina_quest.7.a:0 "Excellent."
 vedina_quest.8.t:0 "Dishonourable Discharge"
 vedina_quest.8.d:0 "The Princess is right, the knights of Vedina do not fight in such underclawed ways. They will fight the dragon with honour and that is that. Poison is for weaklings and treasonous scoundrels, after all. Thus, Sköldsvärd is resolved, she will fight the dragon in a fair fight."
 vedina_quest.8.a:0 "It is the right thing to do."
 vedina_quest.9.t:0 "Victory!"
 vedina_quest.9.d:0 "The brave knights charged forth with the Princess at their head, dashing into the ancient lair of the dragon. There a heated battle erupted. It was a long and drawn out one and some casualties were taken. Still, at the very least the dragon has been killed by the Princess' claws and the dragon's hoard was returned to the village below."
 vedina_quest.9.a:0 "A good outcome at least."
 vedina_quest.10.t:0 "The Royal Artillery"
 vedina_quest.10.d:0 "One of Vedina's finest artillery battalions are stationed nearby. A short journey brought the Princess to their barracks. It didn't take much to work out that a dragon couldn't possibly withstand a barrage from modern artillery guns. Thus, the artillery company is more than happy to assist her. The plan is to use the Princess as bait for the dragon, to lure it out to a specific location. Then, the artillery can blow the beast to smithereens."
 vedina_quest.10.a:0 "Sounds like a good plan."
 vedina_quest.11.t:0 "Hook, Line, and..."
 vedina_quest.11.d:0 "With that the Princess returns to the village. A nice open field lays in front of the dragon's lair, making it a prime location to bombard. Thus, Sköldsvärd leaves the artillery company to set up and journeys to the dragon's lair. Once she has receieved the green light from a flag waved in the distance, the Princess dashes into the cave and attacks the dragon."
 vedina_quest.11.a:0 "Don't you die on me now."
 vedina_quest.12.t:0 "Splat!"
 vedina_quest.12.d:0 "After a few moments, Sköldsvärd returns, with a very angry dragon on her tail. The lumbering beast crashes out of the cave and heads right into the open field. The artillery begins its bombardment, raining shells upon shells on the dragon until there is nothing left but a crater. Sköldsvärd has survived, having gotten herself well clear with her wings, and has earned victory over the dragon, returning its hoard to the people of the town."
 vedina_quest.12.a:0 "Anygriff up for pancakes?"
 vedina_quest.13.t:0 "The People Rise"
 vedina_quest.13.d:0 "This village would do better if it learned to fend for itself. Thus, Sköldsvärd should assist them in defeating the dragon. The people seem reluctant, but the Princess enthuses them that with her help and leadership they can accomplish this lofty task. With that she manages to form an impromptu militia. Now all she has to do is decide their course of action."
 vedina_quest.13.a:0 "An ambush is our best bet."
 vedina_quest.13.b:0 "Let's seal the cave."
 vedina_quest.13.c:0 "Perhaps trained soldiers would be better..."
 vedina_quest.14.t:0 "An Ambush is chosen"
 vedina_quest.14.d:0 "It has been decided that the militia's best chance will be to ambush the dragon outside its lair and use specialised weighted nets to hold it down while they slowly kill the beast with longspears. The preparations are long and the Princess assists with training and construction. It is hard work, but eventually, they are ready. With Sköldsvärd as bait, it is all down to her."
 vedina_quest.14.a:0 "Charge!"
 vedina_quest.15.t:0 "Victory!"
 vedina_quest.15.d:0 "The trap was a success. Sköldsvärd dashed into the cave to get the dragon's attention before running away, drawing the dragon out. There the people of Dunkelskugga struck, and they struck hard, trapping the dragon and fighting it at length with long spears and sharpened poles. It was a slow and painful demise for the creature, and not all of the militia made it back alive. Still, with the threat of the dragon gone and its hoard returned to them, they can now rest at peace and recuperate."
 vedina_quest.15.a:0 "Job done."
 vedina_quest.16.t:0 "Blow It All Up!"
 vedina_quest.16.d:0 "Frankly, getting a militia to fight a dragon is a bad idea. So why not instead use something else entirely? The power of dynamite! With a few careful demolition charges, the sleeping dragon can be killed without a fight. Ingenious indeed. After all, why wake it if it is asleep? With the dynamite secured and the plan in place, all that is needed is the execution."
 vedina_quest.16.a:0 "Just don't bring the whole mountain down..."
 vedina_quest.17.t:0 "Boom!"
 vedina_quest.17.d:0 "A single deafening explosion rung through the mountain as the dynamite was triggered. No doubt the dragon was quite surprised when it exploded in its sleep. Placing the dynamite had been a challenge, but Sköldsvärd is light on her claws, and managed to place it in all the right spots. With the dragon dead, the villagers can now mine out the old lair to retrieve its treasure."
 vedina_quest.17.a:0 "A rather sudden end."
 vedina_quest.18.t:0 "Bandits!"
 vedina_quest.18.d:0 "Another great Vedinian value is the value of honour. Thus, the Princess has come to the County of Flodbotten. Reports of bandits and brigands have come from the county recently, and the local Vedinian nobility seems to have done nothing about it. In order to deliver justice to the county, the Princess must intervene! But how exactly?"
 vedina_quest.18.a:0 "Confront the vagabonds bravely!"
 vedina_quest.18.b:0 "Lure them into an ambush."
 vedina_quest.56.t:0 "A Plot Twist"
 vedina_quest.56.d:0 "This isn't about just bandits anymore. Unfortunately, the quest will not be so straightforward. After confronting the bandits and defeating them in combat, the Princess learned that the local count is actually sponsoring them! He is using the bandits to raid trade convoys, then offers his own soldiers to the merchants for a high price, making quite a profit from protecting the caravans and barges. Sköldsvärd could just leave it, she had defeated the bandits for now, but would it not be better to solve this once and for all?"
 vedina_quest.56.a:0 "Let's solve this properly."
 vedina_quest.56.b:0 "Nah, job done."
 vedina_quest.19.t:0 "Confronting the Lord"
 vedina_quest.19.d:0 "The Count of Flodbotten greeted the Princess with open claws. He freely admits that he was using the bandits for his own gain. In fact, he offers the Princess a portion of the profits should she let him continue. It's a generous offer indeed, but can the Princess really afford to damage her integrity?"
 vedina_quest.19.a:0 "For the right price she can."
 vedina_quest.19.b:0 "Never!"
 vedina_quest.20.t:0 "Change In Management"
 vedina_quest.20.d:0 "The Count has to go, that is for sure. But should the Princess deal with this? She could simply promote a new knight to the position and revoke the count's title, but that would no doubt anger the rest of the nobility. She could put him on trial as well, surely that would be the right thing to do?"
 vedina_quest.20.a:0 "I am the law!"
 vedina_quest.20.b:0 "A fair trial!"
 vedina_quest.21.t:0 "The Trial"
 vedina_quest.21.d:0 "After a fair trial by public jury, the Count is sentenced to death. He is executed and a new regional governor, known for her dedication to law and order, is installed in his place. Justice has prevailed and the Princess has proven herself to be an honourable ruler for Vedina."
 vedina_quest.21.a:0 "Honour is all."
 vedina_quest.22.t:0 "Charity"
 vedina_quest.22.d:0 "In order to ensure a prosperous realm the king's court is expected to donate vast sums of money to good causes in order to boost economic growth in the country and to ensure the health and safety of the people. To get Vedina back on its paws and to ensure that its people prosper, Sköldsvärd is tasked with leading the donations."
 vedina_quest.22.a:0 "What is the situation?"
 vedina_quest.22.b:0 "No charity on my watch!"
 vedina_quest.23.t:0 "Charity"
 vedina_quest.23.d:0 "There are three distinct issues the poor suffer in Vedina. Firstly, traditional village communities have suffered due to continued industrialisation and urbanisation, meaning griffons live increasingly often on their own, without a family to support them. We should invest in community projects and centres in order to bring griffons closer together once again. The second is the large amount of sick griffons in the country. Modern medicine has not quite made its way over to Vedina, so we should take steps to ensure that the people get the care they need. Thirdly, there has been an increase in the awareness of the plight of the disabled. If a factory worker is severely injured at work, then most of the time they are let go from the factory. We should ensure there is some kind of social care for these people, to ensure their families do not go hungry."
 vedina_quest.23.a:0 "Focus on community projects."
 vedina_quest.23.b:0 "Focus on the sick."
 vedina_quest.23.c:0 "Focus on the disabled."
 vedina_quest.23.e:0 "No. We're trying this new thing called austerity."
 vedina_quest.24.t:0 "Charity"
 vedina_quest.24.d:0 "There is still more to do. We have yet to focus on some areas in our country. What should we focus on next?"
 vedina_quest.24.a:0 "Focus on community projects."
 vedina_quest.24.b:0 "Focus on the sick."
 vedina_quest.24.c:0 "Focus on the disabled."
 vedina_quest.24.e:0 "This is taking too long!"
 vedina_quest.25.t:0 "Charity"
 vedina_quest.25.d:0 "There is still more to do. We have yet to focus on some areas in our country. What should we focus on next?"
 vedina_quest.25.a:0 "Focus on community projects."
 vedina_quest.25.b:0 "Focus on the sick."
 vedina_quest.25.c:0 "Focus on the disabled."
 vedina_quest.25.e:0 "This is taking too long!"
 vedina_quest.26.t:0 "Community projects"
 vedina_quest.26.d:0 "Investing in public parks and community projects, we have managed to restore a community spirit with the people. With some government support, these initiatives have soared, and community clubs and celebrations have began in earnest. Griffons support one another and are more willing to share, which is remarkable considering the inherent greed of our species."
 vedina_quest.26.a:0 "No griffon left behind!"
 vedina_quest.26.b:0 "No griffon left behind!"
 vedina_quest.26.c:0 "No griffon left behind!"
 vedina_quest.27.t:0 "Healing The Sick"
 vedina_quest.27.d:0 "Investment in modern hospitals and healthcare have borne fruit. Our people are healthier and better suited for modern life. Life expectancy rates are up and so is productivity. The new health service industry is booming and the people are greatful to the Princess for this investment."
 vedina_quest.27.a:0 "Excellent."
 vedina_quest.27.b:0 "Excellent."
 vedina_quest.27.c:0 "Excellent."
 vedina_quest.28.t:0 "The Disabled"
 vedina_quest.28.d:0 "Our focus on disabled citizens has earned us great respect. A new social credit has been established for those injured in the workplace, which means that less families are going hungry. With this safety net, the disabled can focus on retraining and rebuilding their livelihood."
 vedina_quest.28.a:0 "Wonderful."
 vedina_quest.28.b:0 "Wonderful."
 vedina_quest.28.c:0 "Wonderful."
 vedina_quest.29.t:0 "Sköldsvärd the Charitable"
 vedina_quest.29.d:0 "With three major social issues solved by copious amounts of government funding, Sköldsvärd's position has been strengthened. She has been established as capable of social reform and has proven that she is more than capable of the knightly virtue of charity."
 vedina_quest.29.a:0 "Huzzah."
 vedina_quest.30.t:0 "Austerity"
 vedina_quest.30.d:0 "The notion of charity is all well and good, but it doesn't help the economy. We should cut this waste and ensure that we continue to profit. There is no profit in such activities after all. In order to get our economy back on track, we must cut off this fat and prosper. With a healthier economy, our citizens will be healthier as well, eventually."
 vedina_quest.30.a:0 "Yes, perfect."
 vedina_quest.31.t:0 "Austerity"
 vedina_quest.31.d:0 "With the budget cuts we have purposed, we have managed to cut several unnecesary services down to the bone. This has resulted in a number of savings which can be poured back into our economy."
 vedina_quest.31.a:0 "Job done!"
 vedina_quest.32.t:0 "A Quest of Patience"
 vedina_quest.32.d:0 "Patience, another grand Vedinian virtue. Patience and tolerance of others, giving a knight the ability to learn and adapt to other cultures. For it is true, the world is full of magic and strange creatures aplenty. Perhaps seeking out others will teach Sköldsvärd of patience and tolerance."
 vedina_quest.32.a:0 "Lets go out and about."
 vedina_quest.32.b:0 "Perhaps a good book will teach me?"
 vedina_quest.33.t:0 "A Day on the Beach"
 vedina_quest.33.d:0 "The coastline of Vedina is long, and during her childhood Sköldsvärd grew quite fond of the sea. She found a gentle serenity in the soothing sound of waves and the salty wind from the sea. Surely nothing bad could lurk here? No, just nature's guardians. Yet still, something stirs in the water. What could it be?"
 vedina_quest.33.a:0 "Is it..."
 vedina_quest.34.t:0 "A Monster!"
 vedina_quest.34.d:0 "A sea serpent erupted from the waters, rising high into the air. It looked down upon Sköldsvärd, its visage twisted in hate. "Who dares to once again disturb the peace of my home? This beach belongs to me, not to greedy griffons! I've had enough of your kind!" Clearly the creature was not happy about her being here. The objective of this quest was to make friends and understand creatures, but the serpent's wrath makes the Princess doubt that words could save her. What should she do?"
 vedina_quest.34.a:0 "Teach the beast some respect!"
 vedina_quest.34.b:0 "Surely this anger must come from somewhere."
 vedina_quest.35.t:0 "One Dead Serpent"
 vedina_quest.35.d:0 "The sea serpent's scales are no match for Sköldsvärd's blade. The battle is quick and decisive and Sköldsvärd comes out of it quite unscathed. With the savage beast dead, she returns home. Perhaps she can't be friends with everything after all..."
 vedina_quest.35.a:0 "Oh well..."
 vedina_quest.36.t:0 "Friends With A Serpent"
 vedina_quest.36.d:0 "Sköldsvärd told the sea serpent she meant no harm. She had come seeking him out and wished to know more about him and his kind. She told him she wanted to be friends, and the sea serpent surprisingly broke into tears. He gave her a big strong hug and told her no griffon had ever wanted to be his friend before. After a short introduction, he swam next to Sköldsvärd as she walked along the beach and went on a long monologue about griffons. He only wished to be left in peace, yet the locals continued to harass him, always coming to his home beach to catch fish, swim, sunbathe or to dump their garbage into the ocean. "You see Sköldsvärd," he told her, "At first I told the griffons to leave me alone, but they were afraid of me and thought I was some vile beast who wanted to eat them and attacked me. Ever since I've taken a more stern stance, slowly becoming the monster they thought I was. But you... you weren't like them. You didn't let your assumptions guide you and treated me like an equal. Perhaps I should treat griffons the same from now on."\n\nThat lesson would stick with Sköldsvärd. Each person was far more complex than they first appeared. She left the sea serpent then and vowed to visit from time to time, but most importantly, she instructed the local villagers to avoid the beach and leave the sea serpent alone."
 vedina_quest.36.a:0 "Who knew?"
 vedina_quest.37.t:0 "A Loony Old Bird!"
 vedina_quest.37.d:0 "A griffon suddenly emerged out of the water, equipped with diving gear. He seemed rather old and angry. "You!" he snapped at her, "Get out of here. The ancient treasure buried here belong to me! I've been looking for it for years, and I won't let some chick like you take it from me!" Sköldsvärd was taken aback by the griffon's hostility. Perhaps there is some wisdom to be learned here, but then again, from the looks of this old coot, it will likely be a waste of time. What should she do?"
 vedina_quest.37.a:0 "This griffon needs to be in an asylum."
 vedina_quest.37.b:0 "Perhaps she should speak more softly."
 vedina_quest.38.t:0 "Public Service"
 vedina_quest.38.d:0 "A quiet tip to the local constabulary and the old griffon has been carted off to the asylum. Apparently he is receiving treatment for his unique condition and he will not bother the locals anymore. However, Sköldsvärd wonders if that was the right decision. She didn't even try to figure out if the old griffon was actually ill..."
 vedina_quest.38.a:0 "At least that's one quest down."
 vedina_quest.39.t:0 "A Curious Theory"
 vedina_quest.39.d:0 "It seems that the old loony is rather obsessed with finding this treasure. It takes several hours to earn his trust, but once it is finally earned Sköldsvärd begins to see that he has much wisdom. The old hermit has been a treasure hunter for years, finding everything he looked for except the loot of an ancient searaider lord who once ruled these lands. He had done extensive research and concluded that the treasure had to be buried on the beach, and was certain he was close to finding it. He clearly knows much about history, and Sköldsvärd could well learn from him."
 vedina_quest.39.a:0 "Informative and useful."
 vedina_quest.40.t:0 "Feeling Bookish"
 vedina_quest.40.d:0 "Rather than go outside, Sköldsvärd thinks that she should instead read a book. After all, this questing has taken it out of her a bit, and she wants a nice quiet weekend away with a good book. But what to read?"
 vedina_quest.40.a:0 "Isn't there a new romance novel?"
 vedina_quest.40.b:0 "How about a spellbook?"
 vedina_quest.41.t:0 "Very Stirring"
 vedina_quest.41.d:0 "The romance novel has Sköldsvärd enthralled all week. A lovely griffon couple struggling with debt and the burden of trying to raise children are the main characters. With everything going on, their relationship has stalled, and the book follows their quest to rekindle their relationship and rebuild their lives. Sköldsvärd wonders at its meaning and if she might end up feeling that same love and romance. Perhaps a fling with an unsuspecting griffon will quell these needy feelings."
 vedina_quest.41.a:0 "A fling will certainly suffice."
 vedina_quest.41.b:0 "A romance takes work!"
 vedina_quest.42.t:0 "A One Night Stand"
 vedina_quest.42.d:0 "That dashing and muscular griffon will never know just who the lovely griffoness was. They met in a cozy bar just on the outskirts of Järnköping, and he was too drunk to recognize the Princess. She wanted him and he wanted her. After all was said and done, Sköldsvärd was left feeling empty. There was little point in it all, and she only felt that wonderful feeling for a brief time. Could it be she was wrong?"
 vedina_quest.42.a:0 "Dissapointing."
 vedina_quest.43.t:0 "Waiting For The One"
 vedina_quest.43.d:0 "Sköldsvärd remains determined. Of course, such love cannot be earned in a single night. She will have to wait and hope that her future husband, or wife, is as wonderful as the griffons described in her book. Thus Sköldsvärd resolves to wait until she has been married to experience the pleasures of the flesh."
 vedina_quest.43.a:0 "Waiting for a better reward."
 vedina_quest.44.t:0 "A Spellbook"
 vedina_quest.44.d:0 "The tome of magic is from Equestria, of course. While griffons have their own enchantments, the magic of unicorns is far greater, and very unknown to Sköldsvärd. The book quickly becomes a fascination, the arcane mysteries that unicorns can tap into and bend to their will is quite staggering and different to how griffons react to magical forces. She certainly could know more, but how should she go about that?"
 vedina_quest.44.a:0 "She'll kidnap a unicorn."
 vedina_quest.44.b:0 "She'll befriend a unicorn."
 vedina_quest.45.t:0 "Captured!"
 vedina_quest.45.d:0 "It takes quite a while to find a unicorn to capture. There are a few Equestrian magicians in Vedina, most of which are explorers or foreign advisors. She had to trick one into an ambush and knock them out so they couldn't escape with their magic. After the pony recovers from her questionable act, Sköldsvärd interrogates the pony about their magic, and actually learns a fair bit. However, she now has the problem of a rather terrified unicorn in her basement."
 vedina_quest.45.a:0 "Let's deal with that later."
 vedina_quest.46.t:0 "A Tea Party"
 vedina_quest.46.d:0 "Sköldsvärd decided to host a tea party with several prominent unicorn magicians. Throughout they educate and inform her about the many possibilities that unicorn magic has, as well as telling her of great tales of magical feats. Sköldsvärd is intrigued the entire afternoon, and she learns a lot about them. They can interact with the world very differently to her, and it opens her eyes up to the possibility that there may be other perspectives to problems she has not thought of herself."
 vedina_quest.46.a:0 "What a nice afternoon."
 vedina_quest.47.t:0 "The Knight's Code"
 vedina_quest.47.d:0 "In order to become a fully fledged knight of Vedina, the Princess must learn the Knight's Code and know it by heart. While it is a dull task, it is a very necessary one as there is much wisdom in its words."
 vedina_quest.47.d_try_again:0 "No, that was wrong. I need to start over again.\n\nIn order to become a fully fledged knight of Vedina, the Princess must learn the Knight's Code and know it by heart. While it is a dull task, it is a very necessary one as there is much wisdom in its words."

 vedina_quest.49.t:0 "The Second Tenet"
 vedina_quest.49.d:0 "Yes, Vedinian knights should only fight to defend the weak and protect those under their charge.\n\nVedinian nobility are expected to behave with nobility and grace.

But what are these words to the Princess. What do they mean?"
 vedina_quest.51.a:0 "They're just words."
 vedina_quest.51.b:0 "It means Vedina is awe inspiring."
 vedina_quest.51.c:0 "It teaches one to better oneself."
 vedina_quest.52.t:0 "Just Words"
 vedina_quest.52.d:0 "Yes, perhaps they are just that. Words. Sköldsvärd halfheartedly learns the knightly code for ceremonial purposes, but doesn't give it much thought other than that..."
 vedina_quest.52.a:0 "Oh well..."
 vedina_quest.53.t:0 "Hurrah for Vedina!"
 vedina_quest.53.d:0 "Indeed, this just shows how much better Vedina is than everywhere else. It shows that Vedinian knights truly are noble in purpose and in spirit. Sköldsvärd seeks to be just like them, though is it right that she is just doing that for her country?"
 vedina_quest.53.a:0 "Perhaps."
 vedina_quest.54.t:0 "It Teaches To Better Oneself"
 vedina_quest.54.d:0 "Perhaps Sköldsvärd has understood the meaning behind those words. She seeks to better herself that she might inspire others and spread harmony and good through the world. Perhaps that is the true lesson to be learned here..."

Sköldsvärd has found a mate worthy of being her royal consort, one who will stay by her side through the coming days as she struggles to reform Vedina.\n\nThe wedding has been planned extensively and no expense has been spared, though her partner is less than thrilled to be at the center of such royal opulence! The nobility and the knights still look at her askance, but she knows this will change with time. The line of succession will be secured, and her new consort will help her navigate all of this political intrigue... Or so she hopes. There are a few lingering doubts in the back of her mind.\n\nAnd into this mixture of doubt and happiness, a certain prince seeks a brief private audience with his liege..."

 vedina_wedding.2.d:0 "Ondska meets the princess in the gardens, where once they strolled a-courting. He seems far less composed, far less happy. He makes small talk at first, taking tea and inquiring after the wedding preparations. A knot of anxiety in Sköldsvärd's chest slowly unwinds. She had worried about what he would say, but perhaps he is truly here to wish her well.\n\nUntil, of course, he asks with a practiced air of indifference whether or not she's found that respect she so eagerly sought for in all of courting and questing. Do the griffons of Vedina really respect her? Will they follow her if times turn for the worse? He's heard some terrible things. Some are even whispering that the people are glad to have her weakness shored up by her spouse's strengths. Knights laugh at stories of her hunting expedition and worry that she is too young and foolish to lead the armies of the Kingdom. Isn't there an older, more determined veteran griffon to lead?\n\nOndska offers a simple solution. With him, she could be more than just a figurehead. Together, they could bring these backtalking anklebiters into line and bring Vedina into a glorious new age. All Sköldsvärd has to do is choose a different spouse. "

They want us to go crawling back to the Empire and with your weakness they will get their way. I could have given you everything!"\n\nSköldsvärd rises and forces the arrogant would be suitor back just as his claws reach for a sword. But she does not need to call for guards or for her own sword. Faced with real resistance, the craven griffon takes to the sky, cursing Sköldsvärd and her intended."

Inside, the air is far more reserved. The nobility, the knights, and the leading commons are outwardly congratulatory, but there is some discomfort in the air. It is the same uncertainty that has plagued the princess since the very beginning.\n\nBut at the height of the actual ceremony, there is a pause. The representatives of the various estates step forward to offer their support for the Queen-to-be. The Commons do so readily. The representative chosen for the knightly classes also assents, tho he is noticeably less enthusiastic. The chosen noble, a richly-dressed duke, steps forward, and every griffon present holds their breath. His refusal at this stage would be more than just embarrassing. It would be a disaster of the highest order, enough to potentially set the whole noble estate against Sköldsvärd.\n\nKnights fidget in ceremonial armor. Barons and Counts tense up and look amongst themselves, as if confirming that they all know what is coming next."

The noble estate has chosen to reject the princess' match definitively, and when Sköldsvärd did not assent to being controlled by their will, things came to blows. Chaos tore the wedding celebrations apart, and knights took sides in a chaotic free-for-all. The Princess, her intended, and a rearguard of knights beat a fighting retreat until they could take to the sky in front of the shocked peasantry outside.\n\nThe council of nobles is formed within hours of distraught but grimly determined nobles. This was not the outcome they had hoped for, and outside the commons are in a general uproar. Every griffon on the street wants blood, and most of them want the blood of the landed gentry in particular. The princess, now wildly popular with the lower orders, has escaped and may yet lead a resistance against the council's rule."

 vedina_wedding.6.d:0 "The noble estate gives its blessing, and the wedding proceeds... Until another voice interrupts, one unlooked for and definitely unasked for: Prince Ondska.\n\nHe invokes an ancient right, one of combat. As he does, several black-cloaked knights emerge from the crowd. A coup? No, he says, cutting a dashing figure, a duel! When the new monarch ascends fully to power, they can be challenged. No one has invoked this right in centuries, and it is probably no longer binding. But his knights all carry guns, and he himself has drawn a sword. Outside, more conspirators clash with unprepared guards and cut down slow-moving or uppity commoners who get in their way. \n\nSköldsvärd panics. She has to stop this madman, but what options does she have? Ondska repeats his challenge. Single combat, one on one, for the future of Vedina and its griffons."

At any point, the loyal knights may draw their weapons and the bloodbath will cripple the nation in a moment. Her life and the life of her kingdom is balanced precariously on the edge of a knife.\n\nThere are two choices. On her right, the prelate is still gripping in his ancient claws the ceremonial blade that her forefathers have sworn on for generations. It is heavy, impractical, but it is the choice of the knightly ruler. It's the weapon that her chivalrous ancestors would have chosen without hesitation. If she took it, she would fight Ondska on similar terms, griffon to griffon, and show everyone that Harmony did not need to compromise its integrity.\n\nOn the other claw, on her left is a guard who is stuck mid-step watching the traitors. He cannot move, but she can. His sidearm would solve the supremacist puzzle in front of her efficiently and cleanly, and with luck perhaps take a few of his traitors too.\n\nShe clenches her claws. Two choices, and two potential futures."

Outside, the conspirators lose control of the situation and the scuffles become a running battle. An overeager conspirator with an explosive hit the palace itself with the blast and part of the ceiling comes down.\n\nSköldsvärd looks up... and there, in the loosened masonry, is an ancient looking sword. She acts, springing forward to grab it and dispatch the traitor while there is still time. Chaos rules, but she and Ondska face each other in single combat, their swords high. As she fights, she feels a certainty-- the ancient sword of her fathers was truly false. This is the blade blessed by the Lady, and today she wields it to save her people.\n\nOndska parries her thrusts, and she sidesteps his wild, aggressive attacks. He wounds her leg, but she manages to tear gashes in his arms. He overestimates his own speed, and she hews through a wing.\n\nThe traitor prince goes down, and the Princess offers him a noble end. But he refuses, pulling a knife and tripping her. But it is not to be. Whether imbued with the sword's power or just her own training, Sköldsvärd cuts him down at last, and the conspirators flee the capitol."

The princess wastes no time in grabbing the sidearm from the closest guard.\n\nShe points it at the prince. He rises, meeting her eyes. "Is this how you truly are? A coward?"\n\n"I'm not the one who brought a sword to a wedding because no one would mate with me," Sköldsvärd snarls, her demeanor cold with contempt as she gunned him down. The prince died without his duel, and the conspirators fled from the castle as their leader falls."

His veiled talk of the Strong and the Weak stops being veiled and ironic and becomes explicit and cruel. The Strong crushing the Weak is not something to be avoided, but something that he wishes for fervently. But there is more than that. He talks about the vitality and thrill of magic, real magic, born of blood and acts of domination. He whispers about the absolute power of blood magic, when the right offerings are brought. The world is a machine that you put coins into and pull the lever, and out comes a prize! It's just that sometimes, the coin is griffon lives.\n\nThe Princess is dismayed, but she has also changed. Ondska was right about how others saw her. Despite her triumphs and efforts, the nobles have never respected her. Perhaps they never will, unless she forces them to do so. Sköldsvärd may not be sure about all the blood magic, but putting the fear of Gods into people so that they will finally respect the Worthy? That sounds better and better."

With the help of her own guards, Prince and Princess can take the country's elites hostage and centralize their hold on power in a single day. It's a bold plan.\n\nSköldsvärd decides that its a workable one, as well. She claw-picks several of her most trusted griffons and soon the corruption seeps into every corner of the palace. The guards, the retainer-knights, all of them may not be enthused about magic, but they are certainly loyal to their soon-to-be queen in a way darker than before. When the day of the wedding arrives, they will be ready.\n\nOndska invites several mages from parts unknown and with Sköldsvärd's blessing she gives them lodging in the palace. The knights may grumble about their oddities, but the mages are brilliant researchers... and just as ethically-challenged as Ondska himself."

 vedina_wedding.12.d:0 "The wedding is beautiful, and a tiny part of Sköldsvärd is sad that it will all end in violence. But that part of her is sentimental and weak, the part that the nobles laughed about behind her back. She crushes it.\n\nAs the common and knightly estates send forth a representative to offer their allegiance to the newly crowned Queen, all eyes are on the chosen noble representative. It is his assent that will truly clench the crown... That is, it would if there weren't alternative plans in motion. He steps forward, no doubt to voice his disapproval of the chosen prince, when black cloaked knights spring forth from the illusionary spells that Ondska's mage friends crafted for them. They hold dozens of key noble griffons at sword and gunpoint, and a laughing Ondska confronts the stammering naysayer himself.\n\nKnights draw their weapons, and as Ondska slays the representative in cold blood the palace devolves into chaos as battles rage. Sköldsvärd finds herself looking down at slain noble griffons who she knew used to mock her, and she spits on their corpses. They could have avoided this. They brought this on themselves."

Many knights did not side with the openly evil prince and princess, and now rouse the peasantry to action. Ondska's hope for a single clean stroke is foiled.\n\nBut that's alright. After all, what better way to refine strength than war? As nobles and knights and peasants rise up against his now magically-charged reign, the dark magician is confident that those willing to seize power like himself will always triumph over fearful old griffons and their old ways. His mages work day and night on new spells and curses, and his dark knights whip the miserable commons into shape. Those who will not serve as fodder for the army will serve as fodder for spells or factories. "

She is all alone in this world.\n\nBut when he turns to dark magic, to sacrifice and domination, she recoils. Emotionally, she wants to punish those who have wronged her, that's true. But since she was born, the Princess loved the stories about King Förena and the Wise Lady and the sword Oövervinnlighet. She dreamed of quests and knighthood and being loved by all. This... this isn't anything like that. What has she been doing all this time?\n\nDisgusted, Sköldsvärd tries to push back and change topics, but Ondska is monomanic. He doubles down. She asks him to leave, and he becomes murderously furious. He leaves... only to return the next day. As she walks to clear her head, the Princess and her guards are attacked.

She makes it to the armory with a squadron of guards, only to find that traitors defend it. Battle is joined. She slips through the struggle and stumbles at the door.\n\nOne of the dark knights calls on a talisman given him by a mage and there is a flash of light and fire as the hallway shakes apart. When the smoke clears, there are but two left standing. Sköldsvärd, pressed against the armory door, and a limping traitor. In her panic she tries to get in the door to find a firearm. She manages to get in, finds a pistol, brings it to bear with ammunition as the knight raises his sword...\n\nThe gun jams. Sköldsvärd dies alone, as the knight escapes to rejoin his comrades.

Sköldsvärd herself is almost crushed, but rolls into a crater. There in the indention she finds an ancient strongbox, long buried beneath the castle, now blown open by fighting. And inside?\n\nSköldsvärd lifts the legendary sword Oövervinnlighet high, feeling power running through it. Is it magic, or just the weight of history and purpose? She does not know, but she wields it beautifully, cutting a path to her would be lover Ondska. They fight griffon to griffon, and at last she cuts him down in honorable combat in the great hall before the shattered throne of Vedina. His army is defeated.\n\nSköldsvärd weeps.

She has been scarred by battle and by betrayal... but is also invigorated by the recovery of Vedina's sacred artifact and her own renewed sense of historic, harmonic purpose. The shadow over her soul has been burned away in the fires of conflict.\n\nBut who will sit beside her? Vedina must have heirs and must have a ruling couple. She still needs a consort. Only two choices remain, and both have come in person to offer their help no matter what. Both care for her and also for her nation. Should she choose beautiful, brilliant Lycklig's way of social reform and the uplifting of the common griffon? Or the gallant, dedicated Stridande's path of military reform and a renewed paternalistic harmony for the downtrodden?"

She has another chance, but only just barely.\n\nThe sword Oövervinnlighet takes a prominent place now in the palace as a testament to this, and she had it installed over the throne. It is pointed downwards, in a way that she feels is almost ominous. It seems to say, remember what can happen when you fail. Certainly she knows now.\n\nBut no griffon can be this solemn on the eve of a joyous wedding, and so Sköldsvärd too eventually leaves the quiet of her inner sanctum.

Rumours have been circulating in Vedina for a while now about a growing separatist movement opposed to Princess Sköldsvärd being chosen as King Wingstrom's heir.\n\nWingstrom's spymaster informs him that Duke Fredjanik has begun to amass support in the court and has formed a significant faction within it, earning support among the more traditional Vedinian nobility.\n\nIn order to stop this, we must perform suppressive operations in order to force this faction to disperse."
 wingstrom.4.a:0 "Let us hope it comes to nothing."
 wingstrom.4.b:0 "We should make a general denouncement of this."
 wingstrom.4.c:0 "Perhaps a little reminder to the court about loyalty?"
 wingstrom.4.e:0 "Executioner!"
 wingstrom.5.t:0 "Separatists Rooted In Court"
 wingstrom.5.d:0 "Over the past few days Duke Fredjanik has been making inroads into court and he has managed to turn a good portion of the court against us. He now has a large portion of the old feudal levy on his side and poses a significant enough threat to cause us some pause. We should continue to suppress this initiative if we are not doing so already, as the duke now represents a threat to the Princess.\n\nFrom what we can tell as well, he has connections in the Griffonian Empire, and possibly selfish ambitions as well. His victory will no doubt spell doom for Vedina."
 wingstrom.5.a:0 "We have our own spies, use them."
 wingstrom.5.b:0 "This is nothing to be concerned about."
 wingstrom.5.c:0 "Executioner!"
 wingstrom.5.e:0 "We must continue denouncing them. Prepare for the worst."
 wingstrom.6.t:0 "The Separatists Mass"
 wingstrom.6.d:0 "Deep in their lands, the marshals of known traitor counts are readying their levies and beginning what looks to be war preperations. Equipment and soldiers are being massed in key locations, and it seems they are drawing plans to strike. We have learned that they plan to upset our forces with a large array of small units in the hopes to gain encirclements. We should either prepare for the worst, or hope that our suppression efforts have been enough."
 wingstrom.6.a:0 "We must convince the court."
 wingstrom.6.b:0 "Ready our troops."
 wingstrom.6.c:0 "A tactical raid will do."
 wingstrom.6.e:0 "Prepare the Princess."
 wingstrom.7.t:0 "The Separatist Menace"
 wingstrom.7.d_Win:0 "Thanks to the support we have granted our special task force, we have managed to gather enough evidence of sedition and treason to charge Duke Fredjanik with treason.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning, a special task group arrested him at his winter estate and he has been detained by our loyalist soldiers. He will be tried with treason, and with his arrest, the rest of the separatists will disband or will be arrested as well."
 wingstrom.7.d_Loss:0 "Disaster has struck! Our special task force has failed to sufficiently suppress the separatist movement, and they have now raised their flag in rebellion!\n\nDuke Fredjanik's forces have massed to the west and are well armed and well trained. Yet their divisions are spread very thinly, we may be able to win out if we concentrate our efforts and push hard against them. We should act quickly, this war will only deplete our strained resources."
 wingstrom.7.a:0 "One less problem to worry about."
 wingstrom.7.b:0 "Oh blow."

 wingstrom_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 3rd October, 941, in Turhamn\n\n§YBiography§!: Gustav IV of the House of Wingstrom, commonly referred to as simply "King Wingstrom", has reigned as King of Vedina for decades, maintaining the traditions and values of the chivalrous monarchy before and after the Republican Revolution. Due to Gustav's efforts, the effects of the Revolution on the wayward Kingdom were largely averted, and the nobility continued to support the rule of the Wingstrom dynasty without significant unrest from the commoners.\n\nEleven years after the Republican Revolution, at the age of 48, the Wise Lady and the gods bestowed upon Gustav his only first and only child, a griffon by the name of Sköldsvärd. Gustav's young wife died soon after, and the King was left with only a female heir to pass the trials of the Vedinian monarchy. As the remaining members of the Wingstrom dynasty died out, more and more nobles clamoured for his heir's claw in marriage, desiring the throne of Vedina for themselves, but Gustav refused each and every one of them - declaring that when she came of age, his daughter would prove herself alone to be worthy of the trials of Vedina, and the Wingstrom name.\n\nNow, his daughter has came of age, and the old King, although still popular among the nobility, has decided that he will abdicate upon his heir's the completion of the trials of Vedina. Due to Gustav's actions, he hopes, the Wingstrom name will live on, regardless of whatever cowardly noble is the one to secure his daughter's claw."
 stridande_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 4th May, 974, in Skyrim\n\n§YBiography§!: There is perhaps no griffon that embodies the martial, chivalrous values of Vedina more than Prince Stridande, third son of the Jarl of Skyrim, Olbricht Wulfharth. A troublesome vassal of Vedina for centuries, the Jarldom has traditionally been one of the most fiercely militaristic lands in all of Griffonia, save for perhaps the Knightly Order of Hellquill, so it was no surprise that Stridande took up the sword and shield of a Knight of Vedina.\n\nLow in the line of succession for his Duchy, Stridande served in numerous tours against the Republicans, participating in skirmishes and border exercises against Northern warlords and Kemerskai's government. Now, he has returned to the scene of the Vedinian nobility, in order to woo the Princess of Vedina and unite their houses in marriage.\n\nUltimately, however, will Stridande's strength and loyalty be enough to save Vedina?"
 ondska_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 24th November, 982, in Halmstad\n\n§YBiography§!: It was almost as if Ondska was pre-destined to be a shadowy schemer, dwelling in the courtly intrigues of Vedina with little regard for the outdated morals of the chivalrous Kingdom. Born to the Norén family, Counts of Flodbotten, Ondska was named "Evil" in Vedinian, a testament to his vengeful father's cynical humour. It is perhaps most ironic that Ondska, at least on the interior, appears to embody his name. Ambitious, ruthless, and cunning, he has risen from cousin of the Counts of Flodbotten to one of the most important schemers in all of Vedina.\n\nHandsome and charming, Ondska seems to be a prime candidate for the new Prince of Vedina, should the Princess take what she hears about him at face value. Much-loved by most of the nobility for his facade of courtesy and generosity, Ondska is the prime candidate of the traditionalist faction of Vedina, discontent with Gustav Wingstrom's reforms of the Vedinian monarchy.\n\nHowever, should the princess find herself looking a little deeper, Ondska's plans surely would be foiled - unless he can convince her of the scheming ways of his family himself."

 lsp.42.d:0 "With the final keynote speech given by the father of the Las Pegasus Revolution himself, Starry Plough, the debate has closed on Council Hall for now, with a last vote being taken to put the omnibus bill that has been so painstakingly written over the last many days into law. And despite the appearance of a unanimous vote, there is clearly one faction in control, which can be seen in the debate on the leader, and their title. "
 lsp.42.a:0 "Congratulations, Secretary Starry Plough"
 lsp.42.b:0 "Congratulations, President Sugar Sprinkle"
 lsp.54.t:0 "The Congress Opens"
 lsp.54.d:0 "As the dust settles on Las Pegasus, after we have overcome famine, reactionaries and war, representatives from the trade unions all across the country have arrived in what was the old bastion of capitalism in the city. It is now the flagship of the revolution, and it will remain so for years to come. But in the present, it it playing host to the 1st Congress of the Trade Unions, which will determine the course of Las Peagsus for years to come. \n\nWith Starry Plough already losing ground to the Social Democrat, Sugar Sprinkle, there is also a question of power to be settled in the city. Right now, however, no one knows who will emerge the winner of the Congress. It might be the Father of the revolution, or it might be the Daughter of Reform. In any case, it will all be settled here."
 lsp.54.a:0 "Welcome to the Congress. Reactionaries not welcome."
 lsp.55.t:0 "The Military Matter"
 lsp.55.d:0 "Today, the primary matter up for discussion was the matter of the military. Sugar Sprinkle and her faction in particular has led a charge for a professional military, centralized under the government in Las Pegasus, which immediately gave cause to cries of "Traitor" and "Reactionary" from the hall as she spoke passionately for a military to defend the nation, that worked around the clock, as opposed to what she called "Part-timers", all part of her Wellness Plan.\n\n On the other hoof, Starry Plough talked in favor of keeping the loose militia structure that had served the revolution well during those young, chaotic days, and that we must avoid a military that grows permanent, lest it gets ideas about being in power themselves, as part of his alternate Pegasus Plan\n\nStill, the room is sharply divided with the two camps in each end of the hall. The votes are counted, one after one, after one. And the result is..."
 lsp.55.a:0 "The supporters of the Pegasus Plan have it!"
 lsp.55.b:0 "The supporters of the Wellness Plan have it!"
 lsp.56.t:0 "The Economic Debate"
 lsp.56.d:0 "The primary discussion tabled for today was the structure of the future economy, or rather, the question of how interconnected it should be with the world. Once more, Sugar Sprinkle and Starry Plough could be found in the Great Hall at opposing lecterns dueling each other with words. Their argument by this point has largely boiled down. Starry Plough has been vexing on about how the civil war has shown that a war could break out at any time, and that therefore, we must be ready if another war comes for a total breakdown in trade.\n\nRunning contrary to him, Sugar Sprinkle has denounced it as being foolish and that trying to strive for this will end up with the workers living in worse squalor than before. Additionally, she is pointing out that we have already interacted with other nations diplomatically and that the Baltimare Republic in particular played a part in that."
 lsp.56.a:0 "The listeners support Starry Plough!"
 lsp.56.b:0 "The listeners rally to Sugar Sprinkle!"
 lsp.107.t:0 "The question of an heir"
 lsp.107.d:0 ""You're not the man you used to be, Rokenhar. Don't even try to argue about that." Sugarquill's sweet voice rings in the mayor's chambers. He doesn't reply, and heaves out a heavy sigh as he slowly drags himself out of bed, leaning into her for support. \n\n Sugarquill didn't use to be someone too high-up in the hierarchy. She was just another mayoral advisor working under Rokenhar, making sure that everyone was all well behind the scenes. Nowadays, though, with the mayor hardly able to walk the distance from his chambers to his office, she's become the new most important person for him. Everything he can't do anymore, she does for him. \n\n "I presume I've struck a nerve, judging from your look." she states, dryly looking at him as she helps him down the hall. \n\n "You don't say." a curt response. Rokenhar scoffs, sadly. "What's that supposed to tell me? I know I'm just a shrivelled up old sack of a pony - I see that every time I look in the mirror." \n\n "Please, sir. Now you're just looking for things to be angry about. That's not what I meant at all, and you know that very well." Sugarquill fires back, shooting him a scolding look. Rokenhar groans out another sigh. \n\n "Yes. I'm sorry." he answers with a shake of his head, walking into his office with her. He lays down in his comfy chair, doing all the stretching his stiff muscles can afford, as she pulls the blinds, flooding the room with golden morning light. The mayor half-closes his eyes from the sudden brightness. "It was that whole... heir business you've been going on about."\n\n "At last. I finally got through to you." Sugarquill smiles, looking over him from over his desk. "So? Have you made up your mind about it? Can I start looking?"\n\n "You're really eager for me to die, huh?" Rokenhair quirks an eyebrow, and Sugarquill opens her mouth to reply, but he cuts her off quickly enough with a hoarse laugh. "Yes, yes, I was joking, relax. I know you're just... looking after an old man." \n\n "So, then... you agree. We should start looking.""

 LSP_the_illegitimate_republic_desc:0 "We are a spit of rock in the middle of a churning sea of chaos. A burning wreck. The police is swarmed by looters and criminals. The government cannot keep up with the paperwork. The infrastructure cannot support independence. The border guards watch Equestrian rangers uneasily over the fence. Something must be done. Mayor Rokenhar must put his hoof down."
 LSP_promote_defeatism:0 "Equestria Is Doomed"
 LSP_promote_defeatism_desc:0 "Cleaved in half by a deadly civil war, the rest of Equestria will not stand for long. Even if the conflict will not sprawl into the next decade like most civil wars tend to do, the victorious side will stand upon nothing but a pile of ashes. Weakened, Equestria will fall prey to its neighbours - the Changelings and the communists. We did the right thing to leave when we did."
 LSP_denounce_horror_of_war:0 "The Horrors of War"
 LSP_denounce_horror_of_war_desc:0 "The Equestrian army is running out of ponies to send to the meat-grinder. Conscription has just been approved by the monarchy, and disturbing images of officers lining up fresh recruits forced into their uniforms has filled this week’s news. Let the ponies of Las Pegasus know that if we go back, their future will be one as a conscripted soldier on the receiving end of front-line fire."
 LSP_scaremonger_over_economy:0 "The Impending Crash"
 LSP_scaremonger_over_economy_desc:0 "Grim reports come from the Equestrian stock exchange in Canterlot. Economists predict sharp decreases in the kingdom’s economy, with most of their working-age ponies conscripted and with Nightmare Moon’s legions ravaging their country. Las Pegasus, on the other hand, is currently undergoing a period of stable growth as citizens are gaining trust in the nation."
 LSP_condemn_tyranny:0 "The Condemnation of Tyranny"
 LSP_condemn_tyranny_desc:0 "There’s already rumours that secret police patrols the streets of Canterlot. That conversations all over Equestria are wiretapped. All suspected Nightmare Moon supporters have been secretly arrested.. It was expected that, with war knocking on the capital’s door, Equestria would grow more tyrannical, but never so suddenly. We must denounce the new fascist elements in government."
 LSP_all_enemies_outwitted:0 "Checkmate"
 LSP_all_enemies_outwitted_desc:0 "The mugshots of arrested communist radicals are proudly on display in our police stations. The remnants of the monarchists are barely scrounging up money for their headquarters’ electricity bills. The PCA only has a handful of disgraced members left. In the perfumed silence of Mayor Rokenhar’s office, he opens a bottle of champagne, to celebrate a Great Game fairly won."
 LSP_flirt_left:0 "A Leftwards Wink"
 LSP_flirt_left_desc:0 "There exist factions vying for control in Las Pegasus’ shadows. Communist firebrands of the revolution, monarchist high society, radical puritans dabbling with fascism. Mayor Rokenhar plans to play puppet-master to destroy the opposition in its infancy. And rather than get his hands dirty, he can simply get them to fight each other. The disorganized communists will be easy to manipulate..."

 LSP_anti_monarchism_desc:0 "Left-leaning, red-clad communist firebrands all over the city gather on their soap boxes to chant for the downfall of the bourgeois, declare that Las Pegasus will never see royalty on any throne. Where did they get those megaphones? Their shiny brass buttoned suits? Their polished boots? Mayor Rokenhar grins seeing the approval rating of the monarchist party slowly decline..."

 LSP_secretly_fund_agitators_desc:0 "Materials for their work, secretly delivered to the city’s communists; a red suitcase full of monarchist supporters’ names; a crate of small-arms; several letters of cold cash. All of the pieces of a satisfying puzzle… now, lean back and see it solve itself; hope that no word of it gets out - that’d be a spanner thrown right into the works."
 LSP_anti_fascism:0 "The Fascist Downfall"
 LSP_anti_fascism_desc:0 "On the alleys frequented by PCA speakers, communist agitators begin to set their soapboxes. At every far-right rally, there’s always a far-left counter-protest. Every fascist hate-crime is met with an equally brutal communist counter-attack, the police never batting an eye. The PCA slowly loses favour, as claimed by the latest polls. The plan is going exactly as intended."
 LSP_secretly_arm_workers:0 "Weapons for the Working People"
 LSP_secretly_arm_workers_desc:0 "Caches of combat knives, batons, concealable pistols and instructions for the creation of pipe-bombs and other explosive devices have been hidden throughout the city at different locations. Coded letters and ciphers describing their exact locations have been mailed to the leaders of the reds. Within mere days, PCA and monarchist speakers have learned to steer clear of known communist hot-spots."
 LSP_expose_abuse_of_workers:0 "More Fuel for the Fire"
 LSP_expose_abuse_of_workers_desc:0 "Secret footage of worker mistreatment captured in numerous high-profile companies and factories has been declassified. Rolls of film containing scenes of abuse ranging from unsanitary conditions to workplace mutilation and documents describing the poor pay and treatment of factory workers have been secretly given to the reds. The scenes depicted have already begun appearing in communist propaganda films."
 LSP_leak_army_plans:0 "Leak the Militia’s Plans"
 LSP_leak_army_plans_desc:0 "The PCA possesses a militia force comprised largely of far-right radical volunteers. They wield bats, knives and pitchforks, and frequently patrol the alleys of the city, leaving battered, bruised and occasionally dead communist sympathizers in their wake. The police has managed to compile a comprehensive chart of their patrol routes, and we shall see that it falls in the hands of the reds, to help them avoid confrontation."
 LSP_release_starry_plough_from_prison:0 "Starry Plough’s Release "
 LSP_release_starry_plough_from_prison_desc:0 "Starry Plough, the "Firebrand of the Revolution", after being incarcerated at the onset of independence, has been granted a full pardon by Mayor Rokenhar. Prison wardens were instructed to release him from Forhorn Prison at midnight. Red attacks on fascist and monarchist rallies are expected to grow tenfold. Soon, tensions will reach a breaking point in Las Pegasus."
 LSP_flirt_right:0 "Dabbling with the PCA"
 LSP_flirt_right_desc:0 "There exist factions vying for control in Las Pegasus’ shadows. Communist firebrands of the revolution, monarchist high society, radical puritans embracing fascism. Mayor Rokenhar plans to play puppet-master, to destroy the opposition in its infancy. Rather than get his hands dirty, he can simply get them to fight each other. The PCA is infamous for its extreme views - a perfect puppet."
 LSP_anti_communism:0 "Red Scare"
 LSP_anti_communism_desc:0 "Hospitals city-wide are reporting cases of communist speakers arriving with wounds after beatings by gangs of PCA supporters wielding a wide array of contraband weaponry (wink.). The police, however, has been instructed to remain silent. With red speakers growing wary of fascist lynching, communist popularity is fading. Let us hope word of our involvement doesn’t get out."
 LSP_monarchist_communist_connection:0 "Pine Chest’s Conspiracy"
 LSP_monarchist_communist_connection_desc:0 "The leader of the PCA is the target of moderate critique due to his insane theories and conspiracies. Of course they are nothing but the tirades of a madman, but creating false evidence for some of them could help us in the long term. The ones claiming Celestia a communist sympathiser for her reluctance to crush Stalliongrad could become a heavy blow to both reds and monarchists."
 LSP_fatcats_news_monopoly:0 "Allies in the News"
 LSP_fatcats_news_monopoly_desc:0 "Many wealthy news labels reside within Las Pegasus, and the people benefit from a wide variety of different papers. For a sum of money, many of the owners of the newspapers would have no problem with altering the truth ever so slightly, to make sure support for Mayor Rokenhar’s regime rises and sympathy for Equestria lowers."
 LSP_military_parade:0 "Allow the PCA to Rally"
 LSP_military_parade_desc:0 "Ever since their party rose to power, fascist sympathizers within the PCA have been itching to hold an organized march through the city as a show of force, to prove their better, more robust command structure compared to the communists. Allowing them to hold a rally will more than likely greatly impact red morale."
 LSP_expanded_police_powers:0 "Strengthening Our Position"
 LSP_expanded_police_powers_desc:0 "The ink on Las Pegasus’ constitution is still wet, and with the situation currently so chaotic, there’s nothing stopping us from expanding the powers of our most loyal asset - the Metropolitan Police Force. A few extra privileges, rights and capabilities can go a long way in securing Mayor Rokenhar’s position, and also in bringing order to Las Pegasus."
 LSP_leak_location_of_cells:0 "Gentle Encouragement"
 LSP_leak_location_of_cells_desc:0 "Communists throughout the city, in the wake of harsh battles fought in Las Pegasus’ darker corners, have converted several abandoned warehouses into makeshift prisons for captured PCA fighters. Unbeknownst to them, the mayor has agents and informants everywhere. Leaking the locations of these prisons to the PCA could further encouragement raids and violence."
 LSP_pass_strikebreaking_law:0 "Ban Worker Strikes"
 LSP_pass_strikebreaking_law_desc:0 "In spite of all of their armaments and fiery passion, the communists’ biggest weapon against Las Pegasus were strikes. Industry has ground to a standstill, and the factory overseers and PCA economists are furious. Fortunately for them, a quick footnote added to the lawbook is all we must do to ensure a strikeless future. This will not only weaken the reds, but secure support from the industrial big-leagues."
 LSP_paramilitary_brigades:0 "The Blackhooves"
 LSP_paramilitary_brigades_desc:0 "Pine Chest has been rambling for the better part of Las Pegasus' existence about the strength of his elite forces in Waffleland. His only problem was the government holding him back from establishing his long-desired paramilitary. Until now. With a subtle nod from Mayor Rokenhar, the PCA will get the go-ahead to ship in a trainful of elite soldiers for their new militia. The Blackhooves."
 LSP_battle_on_the_big_boulevard:0 "The Battle on the Big Boulevard"
 LSP_battle_on_the_big_boulevard_desc:0 "With loyalist agents well-rooted in the political activities of our enemies and with the communists and PCA having grown bloated with the support we’ve secretly offered, tensions in Las Pegasus are reaching a boiling point. Though confrontation seems inevitable, Mayor Rokenhar has ordered the police to stand down. Loyalist blood will not be shed in the battle - our enemies shall kill each other."
 LSP_lift_ban_on_public_meetings:0 "Lift The Ban on Public Meetings"
 LSP_lift_ban_on_public_meetings_desc:0 "With the constant threat of yet another city-burning riot, the government outlawed the practice of public meetings comprised of more than three people sometime ago.

 LSP_become_sole_funder:0 "A Controlling Interest"
 LSP_become_sole_funder_desc:0 "The thing about hierarchial fascist militias is that once more than half of them are personally loyal to you, taking over is merely a matter of being ruthless, swift, and above all publically powerful. Rockhoof is good at all three."
 LSP_hostile_take_over:0 "Hostile Takeover"
 LSP_hostile_take_over_desc:0 "Rockhoof prepares to roll the dice, asking small favors and letting some of the PCA's more impatient members into his circle of associates in town. Soon, the old guard PCA leadership will be cut off from its base and from its managers."
 LSP_meet_the_new_boss:0 "Meet The New Boss"
 LSP_meet_the_new_boss_desc:0 "Rockhoof rolls, and it's boxcars. The PCA is personally loyal to the Captain of Industry, and is eager to please. The money flows nowadays, and whatever they used to want, no PCA thug is going to turn down a steady paycheck."
 LSP_pull_strings_in_scs:0 "Pull The Strings"
 LSP_pull_strings_in_scs_desc:0 "Rockhoof is no longer just a high roller. He is *the* the high roller, the undisputed Baron of Las Pegasus. No one does business here without his approval. No one parties without his good graces. And now he casts his eye back to the South, and plans to do the same there."
 LSP_invest_in_SCS:0 "We're Serious About Success"
 LSP_invest_in_SCS_desc:0 "It's not enough to just make money. Rockhoof knows that real wealth comes from smart investments. He plans to do for Las Pegasus what he did with the oil fields of the South."
 LSP_supply_steel:0 "The Steelyards"
 LSP_supply_steel_desc:0 "Las Pegasus has fine steelyards, but they've never been a powerhouse, not like they could be--there just wasn't the call for it before. But Rockhoof has plans for all that steel, selling it to keep the Confederates dependant."
 LSP_joint_research:0 "Joint Research Program"
 LSP_joint_research_desc:0 "Research is best done in groups. One scientist can do quite a bit of work, but having more eyes on a project is best for everyone. Las Pegasus' baron knows enough about technology to know its best done communally."
 LSP_tax_breaks:0 "Tax Breaks!"
 LSP_tax_breaks_desc:0 "The two best words in the common tongue? Tax Breaks! Tax breaks for you, for you, for you, for--actually mostly just for the big producers in Las Pegasus. Gotta keep those indsutrial gears grinding! And also keep the casino lords happy."
 LSP_power_behind_the_throne:0 "Power Behind the Throne"
 LSP_power_behind_the_throne_desc:0 "Rockhoof is everywhere, even when he is absent. Much of the city's and the Confederacy's administration is done by others, but they are all Rockhoof's ponies. The leading families, nominally independant, are really just branch families of Rockhoof's dyansty now."
 LSP_genuine_alliance:0 "A Genuine Alliance"
 LSP_genuine_alliance_desc:0 "It's good to be king, but Rockhoof shies away from absolute power over something as big as the Confederacy. No, better to have others run it, ponies who he can work with and rely upon to be more than yes-men and stooges. True partners, and maybe true friends."
 LSP_flexible_morals:0 "Helpfully Flexible Morality"
 LSP_flexible_morals_desc:0 "What's good, what's moral? Those are questions for lazy fools who have time to ponder about nonsense. What's good is what works, and what works is what is good. Results are the metric of Right, that's the Rockhoof philosophy. Play the Game."
 LSP_flatter_celestia:0 "Sweet-talk the Princess"
 LSP_flatter_celestia_desc:0 "Rockhoof knows his personal empire isn't going to stand on its own. Best to get in good with ole Celestia while the getting is good..."
 LSP_trade_in_eqs:0 "Trade With Equestria"
 LSP_trade_in_eqs_desc:0 "Las Pegasus needs good will, food, and markets. Equestria needs steel, oil, entertainment... really everything. Celestia can be convinced that trade with us on good terms is in her best interest."
 LSP_join_the_war:0 "Join the War"
 LSP_join_the_war_desc:0 "Rockhoof isn't a general, and he isn't keen on fighting. But he is keen on logistics and selling arms, and frankly he's especially keen on a world that is favorable to his own business. Celestia offers that world."
 LSP_flatter_luna:0 "Flatter Luna"
 LSP_flatter_luna_desc:0 "Rockhoof couldn't care a jot less about the princesses, but they're powerful. He can pretend for a bit to have some sympathy for whatever bat related cause Luna has, if it means a sweet deal."
 LSP_guns_for_NLR:0 "Guns For the Lunarists"
 LSP_guns_for_NLR_desc:0 "Luna's empire, or whatever, needs guns. Guns and the steel to make them happens to be a thing we are very interested in supplying."
 LSP_join_NLR:0 "Join the Night"
 LSP_join_NLR_desc:0 "Las Pegasus has invested quite a bit in its relationship with the Lunarites, and their victory means a better world for the bustling city-state. We'll help finish this war and then reap the profit afterward!"
 LSP_flatter_cheeselegs:0 "Suck Up to the Bugs"
 LSP_flatter_cheeselegs_desc:0 "Rockhoof knows danger when he sees it. What he sees coming out of the north scares him to the bone. Chrysalis cannot be fought or resisted, not really. She is a force of nature, one that he intends to weather."
 LSP_steel_for_safety:0 "Steel For Safety"
 LSP_steel_for_safety_desc:0 "You survive a storm by seeking shelter, and you keep the tigers from eating you alive by throwing them meat. We are in a cage with a beast, and to keep it from devouring us we'll offer it something it wants."
 LSP_side_with_CHN:0 "Side With the Queen"
 LSP_side_with_CHN_desc:0 "Rockhoof and Las Pegasus at large do not want to go to war, not really. War is only good for business when you don't have to fight it with your labor force. But if the bugs lose, they'll come for us next. Harmony forgive us."
 LSP_wheeler_dealer:0 "Wheel 'n' Deal"
 LSP_wheeler_dealer_desc:0 "The best part of any game is the Wild Card, really. Sure the trump always wins, but where's the fun in that boring certainty? It's the tried and true Las Pegasus way to roll the dice, no matter how high those stakes. We'll go it alone, and we'll do it gladly."

No monarchists begging for a crown. No gunshots as the police fights looters and loose criminals. No chaos, no more. Peace, at last, has come to Las Pegasus. Mayor Rokenhar has won."
 LSP_fire_ball_and_chain:0 "Fire Ball and Chain"
 LSP_fire_ball_and_chain_desc:0 "Alright, no more dawdling - now that we’ve brought some semblance of stability to the country, it’s time we begun picking up the pieces. Our bureaucracy is, to say the least, bloated and inefficient. We’ve some pruning to do, put old politicians out to pasture, recalibrate the entire government to suit independence. And get rid of that damned Ball and Chain."
 LSP_address_the_food_issue:0 "The Food Issue"
 LSP_address_the_food_issue_desc:0 "One of the biggest issues of our independence is self-sustainability. We are a very populous nation in relation to the amount of arable land at our disposal. We didn’t have time to stockpile food before we seceded, and with all commerce having to pass through Equestria… we need to find a solution before Las Pegasus starves to death."
 LSP_establish_trade_relations:0 "Trade Relations"
 LSP_establish_trade_relations_desc:0 "This should take out two birds with one stone - by establishing trade relations with other nations, we also place Las Pegasus on the world stage as a sovereign state. Emissaries were sent all over the continent - Olenia, the Changelings, the Yaks, Stalliongrad and even Equestria - though we don’t know how much to expect from them."
 LSP_encourage_farming_in_waffleland:0 "Encourage Farming"
 LSP_encourage_farming_in_waffleland_desc:0 "Waffleland is not nearly as urbanized as Las Pegasus to the north, and that may be exactly what we need to combat the issue of food. Constructing irrigation systems and encouraging agriculture in the region will relieve a huge strain off of the country’s food intake."
 LSP_ask_for_charity:0 "Asking for Help"
 LSP_ask_for_charity_desc:0 "However humiliating it may be, Las Pegasus cannot survive without the help of its neighbours. With rations growing more and more meagre by the day, and with the hungry populace starting to look across the border fence to the giant Equestrian food stores, it’s time we sent out emissaries requesting help."
 LSP_high_yield_crops:0 "No More Grapes"
 LSP_high_yield_crops_desc:0 "To survive the food crisis, we must make the best out of our situation, by maximizing the amount of efficiency extracted from our limited soil. Areas like viticulture, fruticulture and pasturing are not at all efficient in relation to the amount of space they take up, so we must refocus on planting high-yield plants like grain and maize."
 LSP_safe_from_famine:0 "Safe From Famine"
 LSP_safe_from_famine_desc:0 "All our efforts are finally paying off. Food yield is in the green - we’re producing more than we’re consuming. Granted, only barely more than we’re consuming, but as time goes on, yield will slowly rise. Yet another crisis has been averted, and for the first time in a long time, ponies of Las Pegasus can enjoy full, unrationed meals."
 LSP_restore_order:0 "The Restoration of Order"
 LSP_restore_order_desc:0 "Enough mucking about. With the political situation stabilized and the food issue sorted out, it’s time Mayor Rokenhar put his hoof down. We’ve braved the worst of the storm, and we’re finally ready to reap the rewards of our determination. Rejoining Equestria is an idea of the past. Las Pegasus can finally stand on its own legs. Order, at last."
 LSP_seize_assets:0 "Punish the Opportunists"
 LSP_seize_assets_desc:0 "In the chaos of secession, several corporations believed the government would collapse and, therefore, they instead decided to support more radical opposition fronts. It’s about time we got back at them, and made sure to establish a loyal industrial base. This can also be a great opportunity to seize the assets of some… unsavory ponies, such as Pine Chest."
 LSP_clean_up_harmonists:0 "Deal with the Harmonists"
 LSP_clean_up_harmonists_desc:0 "With the thoughts of reunification having left the minds of most citizens, we can finally pinpoint our efforts on stomping out any last, stubborn anti-independence movement. Offer amnesty to those who agree to stand down, and prepare the court for treason charges against those who remain adamantly pro-Equestrian."
 LSP_increased_police_presence:0 "Call the National Guard"
 LSP_increased_police_presence_desc:0 "A cursory look at the streets of Las Pegasus is enough to show that crime is not dying down at pace we had hoped for. The police department is still struggling to cope with the wave of criminals from the days of anarchy, so we must call for backup, in the form of the National Guard, until criminal activities lower."
 LSP_the_mayors_las_pegasus:0 "The Mayor’s Las Pegasus"
 LSP_the_mayors_las_pegasus_desc:0 "The last anarchic cells have surrendered. Protests are finally a rarity. The value of the currency is rising, and the amount of "down with the government!" graffiti has declined drastically. Every pressing issue that plagued the city at the onset of independence has been dealt with, and finally, Mayor Rokenhar can have a breath of peace."
 LSP_military_rebuilding:0 "Reorganizing the Army"
 LSP_military_rebuilding_desc:0 "It’s about time we looked at our armed forces. The army has been largely neglected. It was always a "we’ll fix it later" issue - but later is now, and Las Pegasus can wait no longer. We are threatened by Equestria on the daily, and it’s about time we established a proper, professional army for our defense."
 LSP_destroy_CLA_influence:0 "Integrate the Communists"
 LSP_destroy_CLA_influence_desc:0 "Though they tried to destroy our government, the CLA is still a political party in our government, and it’d be tyrannical to end them. So, if you can’t beat them, make them join you. By enrolling the reds, we’ll be making sure they remain under our constant supervision. And, if there’s ever a war, at least they’ll be the ones to die first." 
 LSP_destroy_PCA_influence:0 "Integrate the Fascists"
 LSP_destroy_PCA_influence_desc:0 "Though they tried to destroy our government, the PCA is still a political party in our government, and it’d be tyrannical to end them. So, if you can’t beat them, make them join you. By enrolling the fascists, we’ll be making sure they remain under our constant supervision. And, if there’s ever a war, at least they’ll be the ones to die first."
 LSP_expand_national_guard:0 "Expand the National Guard"
 LSP_expand_national_guard_desc:0 "As the needs of our police force rise steadily with our growing prosperity and our growing criminal underworld, the National Guard has made multiple requests for extra personnel. It’s about time we answered those requests and offered our boys some well-deserved help."
 LSP_restore_officer_corp:0 "Restore the Officer Corps"

 LSP_the_army_of_las_pegasus:0 "The New Army"
 LSP_the_army_of_las_pegasus_desc:0 "Soldiers, check. Guns, check. Generals, check. A lack of inner strife, check-check. We have all the ingredients to begin proper work on our armed forces. As the sun sets over Equestria, in the bronze light of dusk, the new army of Las Pegasus stands strong, proud, and ready to serve."
 LSP_global_las_pegasus:0 "Global Las Pegasus"
LSP_global_las_pegasus_desc:0 "We’ve already established formal relations with other nations through our earlier trade agreements back during the famine, but it’s about time we’ve stepped up our game. It’s time to push Las Pegasus out onto the world stage, in all its revitalized, rebuilt glory."
 LSP_collaborate_SCS:0 "Collaborate with the South"
LSP_collaborate_SCS_desc:0 "The Southern Confederate States are in a pickle much like ours - whereas we were the ones to abandon the Canterlot government, they were abandoned by said government, therefore they seceded. As two nations born of the same bloated empire, we are sisters of the south, and we should work to improve relations and establish an alliance. "
LSP_encourage_southern_migration:0 "Encourage Southern Migration"
LSP_encourage_southern_migration_desc:0 "We have all that the south needs, and the south has all that we need - we have a thriving economy and infrastructure, they have the population to supply them. Encouraging migration into Waffleland would provide jobs for southerners, and extra ponypower for Las Pegasus."
LSP_southern_army_influence:0 "Southern Military Training"
LSP_southern_army_influence_desc:0 "The south has seen confrontation with Equestria far more fierce than we have. They have experience which Las Pegasus deeply lacks and knowledge of modern warfare that we need if we don’t want to fall behind militarily-speaking. We should work to learn from them, to incorporate some southern tactics into the Las Pegasus army."
LSP_mutual_resources:0 "Resource-Sharing"
LSP_mutual_resources_desc:0 "Both of our nations have something that the other craves - the south has its vast fields of black gold, and Las Pegasus has its mighty working steel mills. Offering some of our resources to the other would be a great way to further intertwine our economies, and to greatly improve relations." 
LSP_the_desert_rangers:0 "The Desert Rangers"
LSP_the_desert_rangers_desc:0 "The southern gunslinger rangers are renowned for their battle-prowess and fierceness. Convincing the S.C.S. to offer us a few battalions would be a great boost for Las Pegasus’ army."
LSP_second_republic_of_the_greater_confederation:0 "The Second Republic"
LSP_second_republic_of_the_greater_confederation_desc:0 "After such strides towards friendship, mutual understanding, and military assistance, it’s about time we’ve established even closer relations with the S.C.S., by declaring Las Pegasus to the be the first addition to the Confederation. We will remain sovereign, but we will be closer politically, economically and militarily than ever."
 LSP_staunch_defiance:0 "Staunchly defiant"
LSP_staunch_defiance_desc:0 "Las Pegasus doesn’t need allies - all of our strength, our might, we’ve acquired facing all hardships alone. We are ready to finally stand on our own hooves, separate from any other power, ruled by a single will, governed by a single destiny. Las Pegasus stands alone, determined and ready. A rock of stability in a sea of chaos."
LSP_defensive_mindset:0 "A defensive mindset"
LSP_defensive_mindset_desc:0 "Las Pegasus, though strong, is dwarfed in size and population by its neighbours. We simply do not have the raw manpower and resources needed to wage offensive warfare. Therefore, we will let our enemies come to us. Dig in. Prepare. Fight. And win. Let their blood fertilize our fields."
LSP_the_lsp_rangers:0 "The Las Pegasus Rangers"
LSP_the_lsp_rangers_desc:0 "Some officers of the National Guard and other facets of the military have shown a kind of ferocity, combat-excellence and superiority on the field that could match even Equestria’s famed rangers. It’s about time we established our own Ranger Corps. "
LSP_creep_north:0 "Creep north"
LSP_creep_north_desc:0 "Las Pegasus needs room to breathe. Though we arguably have room southwards into Waffleland, the city hugs the northern border uneasily. It’s about time we stretched out a little."
LSP_creep_south:0 "Creep south"
LSP_creep_south_desc:0 "Much of Waffleland is dominated by agriculture to fuel the main city, but even now, the food situation is unsteady at best. The lands south are vast and fertile, and could provide great opportunities for more food."
LSP_consolidate_our_grip:0 "Consolidate our grip"
LSP_consolidate_our_grip_desc:0 "It’s time to hang up the hatchet. We’ve carved the territory we need out of our neighbours, now the question is all about integrating it into Las Pegasus proper."
 LSP_collaborate_EQS:0 "Collaborate with Equestria"
LSP_collaborate_EQS_desc:0 "We’ve had our ups and downs, yes, but Equestria is still our largest and arguably strongest neighbour. Perhaps it would be wisest for us to take back some of the less savory accusations we’ve made on the onset of independence and try to repair our relationship, ask for an alliance, and pray that they don’t bomb the hell out of us."
LSP_equestrian_science_is_the_greatest_in_the_world:0 "Equestrian Science Collaboration"
LSP_equestrian_science_is_the_greatest_in_the_world_desc:0 "While Las Pegasus is quite advanced, it still doesn’t hold a candle to Equestria’s sprawling research infrastructure. Patching into that network of universities, laboratories and research centers would boost the country’s scientific base significantly."
LSP_normalise_immigration:0 "Normalise Immigration"
LSP_normalise_immigration_desc:0 "The enormous border fence between us and Equestria has been an eyesore ever since it was cobbled together on the onset of independence. It’s about time we took it down, and established a more amiable, less hostile relationship with our neighbour in regards the immigration."
LSP_request_investment:0 "Request investments"
LSP_request_investment_desc:0 "Though ravaged by civil war, the Equestrian economy is still flowering. Certainly they have a little bit of spare profit to invest into Las Pegasus. After all, a few bit of investments could go a long way, and can only work to further bridge the gap between us. Not to mention, you know, money."
LSP_the_equestrian_rangers:0 "The Equestrian Rangers"
LSP_the_equestrian_rangers_desc:0 "We have the National Guard, yes, but few soldiers can stand up against the famed Equestrian Rangers. Battlehardened from combat, they will make a fine addition to Las Pegasus’ army, and Equestria would likely not mind having a tiny foothold of influence in Las Pegasus’ army."
LSP_request_recognition:0 "Request recognition"
LSP_request_recognition_desc:0 "We’ve come a long way, Equestria and Las Pegasus. From enemies, back to friends through circumstance. The wish to reunite is long gone, but that doesn’t mean there should be any animosity between us. It’s time to bury the hatchet - it’s time to request recognition from our mother-nation."
 LSP_house_of_cards:0 "Reinforcing the House of Cards"
 LSP_house_of_cards_desc:0 "Though Las Pegasus is at last strong and stable, Mayor Rokenhar will not live long to see it. All of the chaos, the stress - it's taken a toll on the old pony. The days drag on, harder and harder, and it won't be long before he takes his last breath. Time is short. Las Pegasus was his dream, and he's all that holds the city together. Las Pegasus dies with Mayor Rokenhar. That cannot be allowed."
 LSP_post_military:0 "Ensure a Standing Army"
 LSP_post_military_desc:0 "The foundation of a strong military is set in place, though the troops are still green, and the officer core is still questionable. It's time to clean house - remove the corrupt officers, the incompetent generals, all of the consequences of earlier cronyism. Ensure Las Pegasus has a safe future."
 LSP_root_out_corruption:0 "Root Out Corruption"
 LSP_root_out_corruption_desc:0 "Much of Las Pegasus' army is comprised of ponies not particularly skilled, but which Rokenhar could trust at the time of its creation. Now that the threat of conflict is largely gone, we can afford a more diverse, and thus less corrupt, government. It's about time we've performed a general audit of the army's higher-ups - see who stays and who's got to go."
 LSP_dont_fight_for_me:0 "Fight for the City"
 LSP_dont_fight_for_me_desc:0 "We've been left with a strong core of competent, fiercely loyal officers. The only problem is who they are fiercely loyal to - Mayor Rokenhar. Once he leaves, the army will crumble back into corruption and croynism. We need to finally bring something to Las Pegasus - patriotism. Teach the soldiers to fight not for Mr. Rokenhar, but for the city. For the country. For its people. For Las Pegasus."
 LSP_post_industry:0 "Industrial Reform"
 LSP_post_industry_desc:0 "Las Pegasus is already a highly-urbanized and well-industrialized area, but that doesn't mean there's no room for improvement. Ensuring the people and entrepreneurs that the government hasn't forgotten about the economy will help the people have more faith in the market - and will give us more assets to work with, in the long term."
 LSP_fairer_taxation:0 "Fairer taxation"
 LSP_fairer_taxation_desc:0 "It's about time we handled that issue. Yes, that issue. The big elephant in the room and the even bigger mountain of papers in the Ministry of Finance - taxation. Las Pegasus works on an Equestrian system which is ludicrously, almost comically unsuited for independence. Giving it a good overhaul will lead to overall fairer taxation, and thus a happier populace."
 LSP_reach_out_to_unions:0 "Reach out to the Unions"
 LSP_reach_out_to_unions_desc:0 "Though the communists were defeated, they still have a strong support base with the workers, unsurprisingly. Reaching out to them with promises of better worker conditions and pay could generously bridge the gap between them and the government, and finally disarm the ticking time-bomb attached to the economy that the trade unions have been."
 LSP_post_law:0 "Lay down the Law"
 LSP_post_law_desc:0 "Though the police has been growing more and more efficient in handling the country's issues lately, it's still following a very crude, decentralized system of laws. Concentrating and assembling an easy-to-follow, strict-yet-fair law code will lift another stone off the country's back."
 LSP_actual_constitution:0 "An Actual Constitution"
 LSP_actual_constitution_desc:0 "Right now, Las Pegasus' "constitution" looks more like a school scrapbook than a government lawbook - full of scratches, footnotes, ink marks, parentheses and contraditions. Reforming it into a more concise book of fundamental laws and obligations for both the government and the population has been long overdue."
 LSP_proper_police:0 "Proper Police"
 LSP_proper_police_desc:0 "The Las Pegasus Metropolitan Police has served us well so far, but their days have finally come to an end. With a new constitution, independence, and a new law-code, it's time to throw out the old and bring out the new. The National Affairs Bureau - NAB. Coined by Rokenhar himself."
 LSP_post_heir:0 "Dark Times Ahead"
 LSP_post_heir_desc:0 "Las Pegasus can be as stable as Rokenhar can bring himself to make it - but if there's nobody to pick up the mantle after his death, all of that progress, that stability, that effort, will go to waste. Las Pegasus must not be allowed to fall into chaos again. We must find a suitable heir."
 LSP_appoint_heir:0 "Appoint an Heir"
 LSP_appoint_heir_desc:0 "We have a lot of options to choose from. Everyone is eager to wield the fist of power, but there are only a few who are worthy. The more trustworthy civil servants are already combing through files and reports, and every possible candidate for the next mayor position goes through Rokenhar, first. Of course we're not going to call them "heir" - that'd put the monarchists in way too big a tizzy."
 LSP_ensure_smooth_succession:0 "Ensure a Smooth Succession"
 LSP_ensure_smooth_succession_desc:0 "We've found a good heir - loyal, fierce, and ready for the challenges Las Pegasus must face ahead. Now, we just need to make sure the people support them, and that they'll survive in the dog-eat-dog government. Thankfully, Mayor Rokenhar still has favours to cash in, and contacts he can call up, to ensure succession will be smooth, bloodless, and dramaless."
 LSP_post_personal:0 "Loose Ends"
 LSP_post_personal_desc:0 "Mayor Rokenhar has kept a family picture on his nighstand since Las Pegasus gained independence. For so long, the city has been his life. He's tried his best not to foget of his family, his wife and son. But he never found time to return to them, with the city matters being so pressing. Now, in the twilight of his life, he can postpone them no longer. This may be his last chance to see them again."
 LSP_visit_family:0 "A Call to the Past"
 LSP_visit_family_desc:0 "He's been sending them letters, hoping for a reply. A message, a sign of life, anything. He's sent a new letter every single day, without a single sign. Until today. 'We miss you.' followed an address. At last, the passage of time seems less dreadful."
 LSP_bucket_list:0 "The Swan Song"
 LSP_bucket_list_desc:0 "There's a lot of things he wanted to try out, at one point. Fishing, for one. Or, well, learning to fish. Learning to play golf. Taking a trip to the Pinglands, at one point. The more the days wear on, the longer the list seems. Maybe he should tick off some of the items - make sure he leaves behind a legacy worth more than the city."
LSP_expand_the_army:0 "Expand the Army"
LSP_expand_the_army_desc:0 "After a cursory look, it's become very obvious that more ponies are needed to fill the ranks. A handful of recruits per trench won't do - we need artillerymen, snipers, shock-troops, riflemen, gunners, tankers. We have a long road ahead - but the journey from Las Pegasus to Canterlot begins with a single step."
LSP_mayor_sup_fire:0 "Bomb the Hell out of Them"
LSP_mayor_sup_fire_desc:0 "Las Pegasus doesn't have the ponypower for heroic charges or grand tsunamis of soldiers crashing into enemy lines as seen in action movies. Our soldiers' lives are precious -  shells, however, are cheap. Why fight, when we can just bombard our enemy to smithereens?"
LSP_shell_assembly_lines:0 "Shell Assembly Lines"
LSP_shell_assembly_lines_desc:0 "We can't bombard our enemies with spit and rocks - if we want our artillery to do more damage than a light spring rain, we have to make sure we have the shells to fire. Investing in more adquate production lines for artillery pieces will make sure a lack of armament will not be an issue."
LSP_thunder_bringer_battalion:0 "Bigger Gun, Better Performance"
LSP_thunder_bringer_battalion_desc:0 "While Las Pegasus' artillery pieces are nothing to turn one's nose up at, it's wise to make sure we don't fall behind in the arms race. "Don't fix what ain't broke", as the old saying goes - but nothing stops us from improving our existing artillery."
LSP_artillery_factories:0 "Artillery Factories"
LSP_artillery_factories_desc:0 "As the army grows, the need for more artillery pieces to support our soldiers becomes apparent. Rather than putting undue strain on our other production centers, it'd be wiser to dedicate a whole new manufacturing sector for armament production."
LSP_at_ap:0 "Eyes on the Sky"
LSP_at_ap_desc:0 "We have big guns, yes - that's very good. But, those big guns are also immobile, and would be very easily targeted and destroyed by bombers or fast-moving tanks. Therefore, we should make sure that we don't leave them exposed by giving some attention to our anti-tank and anti-air capabilities."
LSP_enhanced_rifles:0 "Improved Rifles"
LSP_enhanced_rifles_desc:0 "As important as artillery is, it's still important that the soldier is ready and well-equipped. After all, the fire pieces only exist to soften up the enemy that the infantry must then fight - so we should make sure that said infantry only has access to the best weapons."
LSP_not_one_wasted_life:0 "Not One Wasted Life"
LSP_not_one_wasted_life_desc:0 "With our limited ponypower, it only makes sense that we make sure none of it goes to waste. Our soldiers should have access to the same care in the field that civilians get in the city, and that means mobile hospitals, field kitchens, intensive care units, better medicine - anything for the fighting pony."
 LSP_mayor_mob_war:0 "Outmaneuver the Hell out of Them"
 LSP_mayor_mob_war_desc:0 "Las Pegasus doesn't have the ponypower to fight a drawn-out war of attrition, to let the days on the calendar drag on. In warfare, time is not on the smaller nation's side. If we are to win, we must make sure victory would be swift, unchallengeable, and uncounterable. We must strike fast, kill fast, and win fast."
 LSP_we_need_tanks:0 "Armoured Spearhead"
 LSP_we_need_tanks_desc:0 "Strength, firepower, and raw armoured might. The tank makes or breaks a mobile army, and we must make sure that our own armour is the best of the best, the strongest of the strongest, if we want to survive. Our tanks will punch a hole into the enemy lines that our infantry will then exploit."
 LSP_motorised_and_mechanised:0 "Motorized Spine"
 LSP_motorised_and_mechanised_desc:0 "If the armour is the tip of the spearhead, the motorized brigades will be the hilt and spine. Once the tanks break a hole in the enemy defenses, our motorized and mechanised divisions will rush through and exploit the defensive gap, and crush our enemies before they even have a chance of fighting back."
 LSP_armor_factories:0 "Armour Factories"
 LSP_armor_factories_desc:0 "Tanks, half-tracks, and trucks are useful, but costly to build. If we want adequate production numbers, we have to make sure a decent portion of our industry focuses on supplying the front lines with the needed equipment."
 LSP_and_planes_too:0 "Strike from the Heavens"
 LSP_and_planes_too_desc:0 "We cannot simply rely on our ground forces for a breakthrough. If we want to rule the battlefield, we must focus on ruling the skies above it, first. Aerial supremacy must not be ignored, and we must make sure our fighters, bombers and CAS are among the best if we don't want the spear to crumble against the defense."
 LSP_you_will_use_mechanised_dammit:0 "Armoured Reliance"
 LSP_you_will_use_mechanised_dammit_desc:0 "The average soldier can only take so many bullets - which is not many at all. Armoured cars, however, are faster, stronger and more defensible than ponies. Introducing them to our field operations will only increase success rate on the battlefield."
 LSP_make_everything_cheaper:0 "Overhauled Production Methods"
 LSP_make_everything_cheaper_desc:0 "The dusty, hard-hooved workers on the manufacturing front have become expert craftsmen in the field of armour-production. Utilizing recent breakthroughs in factory efficiency, combined with new workman-expertise will only mean cheaper, more reliable armoured fighting vehicles for Las Pegasus."
 LSP_mayor_battleplan:0 "Outsmart the Hell out of Them"
 LSP_mayor_battleplan_desc:0 "War is more than a soldier sitting in a foxhole. War is maps, plans, production numbers, lists and logistics. The generals, officers and captains are just as important as the soldiers themselves, and victory will best be achieved not through mindless fighting, but through tactful planning."
 LSP_gbp_path_gotta_have_engineers:0 "The Engineer Corps"
 LSP_gbp_path_gotta_have_engineers_desc:0 "The engineers stand as the new foundation of modern warfare - they dig the trenches the riflemen wait in, they lay the minefields the riflemen defend, they set up the artillery that supports the riflemen. They are the cornerstone of every plan, and a weak engineer core means a weak army."
 LSP_spawn_more_horses:0 "A Stronger Guard"
 LSP_spawn_more_horses_desc:0 "The National Guard are some of the most elite units Las Pegasus has to offer - strong, determined, courageous and loyal. Making sure that our army is an elite one should be a top priority, and strengthening the National Guard will, in turn, strengthen our army."
 LSP_cement_factories:0 "Cement Factories"
 LSP_cement_factories_desc:0 "Cement is the material of warfare. Lead builds bullets, steel builds tanks, aluminum builds planes... but cement builds bunkers, trenches, defense strongpoints. If we let our enemies come to us, we should be ready to give them a cold, concrete welcome."
 LSP_elite_weaponry:0 "Elite Weaponry"
 LSP_elite_weaponry_desc:0 "We are ponies - magic flows through our blood, our flesh, our muscles. Our magic is not just a crutch, a novelty, though. It's our biggest, strongest weapon. We must hone our skills with this weapon if we want victory."
 LSP_magic:0 "Magesoldiers"
 LSP_magic_desc:0 "There is a thin line between warfare and wizardry. Our pegasi can rule the skies in place of planes, our earth ponies can charge forward in place of motorized, our unicorns can blast enemies away with all of the might of artillery. We have all of the ingredients for an army of wizards - we must only combine them."
 LSP_every_family_a_soldier:0 "Every Family a Soldier"
 LSP_every_family_a_soldier_desc:0 "We are surrounded by enemies. We are surrounded by nations jealous of Las Pegasus' wealth, power, and beauty. We are a lone rock in the churning sea of violence. To survive, we must fight. To survive, all must play their part - and there exists no part to play more honourable than service."

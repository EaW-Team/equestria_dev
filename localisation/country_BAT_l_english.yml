BAT_use_smuggler_networks:0 "Bolster the Smuggling Operations"
BAT_use_smuggler_networks_desc:0 "Wars are meat grinders that consume both bodies and guns, and the civil war tearing Equestria apart is a war unlike any we have faced before. To this end, we must acquire more weapons than ever before, and we must do it now."
BAT_fillydelphia_FOB:0 "FOB Summerfield"

BAT_disappear_prisoners:0 "Take On the Burden"
BAT_disappear_prisoners_desc:0 "Many ponies in Her Imperial Majesty's territory have refused to see the truth, and the longer they rot, the more they consume resources our Queen needs in her war. We will offer to take on these prisoners: we know how to put them to good use."
BAT_send_over_instructors:0 "Send Instructors"
BAT_send_over_instructors_desc:0 "For a thousand years we have waited and prepared, and in that time we have learned much of war. Our numbers may pale in comparison to Her Imperial Majesty's Equestrian legions, but with our knowledge they can become even more deadly."
BAT_drive_up_recruitment:0 "Drive Up Recruitment"

BAT_massive_recruitment_campaign:0 "Expand the Imperial Rifles"
BAT_massive_recruitment_campaign_desc:0 "The Imperial Rifles have served well, and keeping their numbers down has helped us keep them as elite as they have been, but this war will demand more than the formations we currently have."
BAT_radar_preparation:0 "Forward Listening Posts"
BAT_radar_preparation_desc:0 "The world groans under the weight of the grand clash, and our enemies at home will gladly strike at us if we drop our guard. In order to counter this, we need to keep monitoring their every move, lest they catch us unaware."
BAT_boost_wartime_production:0 "The War At the Homefront"
BAT_boost_wartime_production_desc:0 "The luxuries of peace must become a distant memory for us, any waste or hesitation to commit would not only sabotage the war effort, but also be outright treasonous towards Her Imperial Majesty. We are not going to commit anything less than all we have to Her!"

BAT_producing_support:0 "Support Gear Procurement"
BAT_producing_support_desc:0 "Our smuggling network is vast, and we can use it to procure more than just rifles. If we focus our efforts on acquiring more specialized tools, that will let our industry focus on the more easily-produced equipment."
BAT_producing_trucks:0 "Expand Vehicular Production"
BAT_producing_trucks_desc:0 "Unlike in Her Imperial Majesty's first war for dominance, this war will demand vehicles as well as bodies, and our engineers have thankfully produced designs that will serve both us and Her Imperial Majesty well, as long as we make sure to get the vehicle production up and running."
BAT_producing_artillery:0 "Artillery Procurements"
BAT_producing_artillery_desc:0 "Properly deployed, artillery can account for three-fourths of all the casualties inflicted upon the enemy. Our Imperial Rifles have always made good use of artillery since the advent of gunpowder, and in order to ensure that we can keep hammering our foes, we must make sure to acquire as many artillery pieces as possible."
BAT_send_advisors:0 "The Jungle Corps"
BAT_send_advisors_desc:0 "Southern Equestria is teeming with jungles, and our exile in Zebrica has given us plenty of experience fighting in them. Using this knowledge, we can ensure the Disciples of the Night can use the jungles to their greatest advantage. "
BAT_training_camps:0 "Insurgent Training Camps"
BAT_training_camps_desc:0 "Equestria's southern regions are contested by the Disciples of the Night, a zealous army indeed. Yet, their zeal outpaces their skill, and if they are to be the weapons that Her Imperial Majesty truly needs, we must spare no expenses in helping to mould them into true soldiers of the Night."
BAT_send_them_equipment:0 "Supply the Disciples"
BAT_send_them_equipment_desc:0 "The Disciples are fighting a war on several fronts, and all the zeal in the world can't compensate for lack of equipment. We must ensure that they are given proper armaments, no matter what we must do to reach them."
BAT_skim_a_bit_of_rubber:0 "Domestic Rubber Production"
BAT_skim_a_bit_of_rubber_desc:0 "Chiropterra has the perfect climate to produce rubber, and with the realization of how important this material is for modern wars, the recourse is clear; start producing all the rubber we can. It is not glamourous, but necessary, and victory will demand the mundane as much as the heroic."
BAT_prisoner_camps:0 "Transport the POWs"
BAT_prisoner_camps_desc:0 "As Her Imperial Majesty's loyalists seize more and more prisoners, we have humbly offered to keep them in our lands. Of course, that is not to say we were planning to just let them sit around. If they won't serve the Night willingly, they can serve unwillingly."
BAT_psychological_fighting:0 "Psychological Warfare"
BAT_psychological_fighting_desc:0 "The soft ponies of Equestria might think they are ready to fight us, but they'll learn otherwise. Wars are won when your opponent is broken, whether physically or spiritually, and terror is as deadly a blade as any gun."

BAT_yet_another_failure:0 "Yet Another Failure"
BAT_yet_another_failure_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, Operation Moonshine has failed. It is the second rebellion our bloodlines have lost and it will take the powers of the Nightmare herself to convince our nation that we should prepare for a third attempt. We must look to our current state of affairs and determine what needs to be changed so that we can last another thousand years."
BAT_emergency_session:0 "Turn Back the Clock"
BAT_emergency_session_desc:0 "Although our efforts in Equus have failed, we are still a minute from midnight! While the heretical sun may have driven us back into the shadows, around us are a great many rich and fertile lands. It is time, for the future of Chiropterra, that we look to the world that is immediately around us; Zebrica."
BAT_limited_diplomacy:0 "Prepare the Second Great Conquest"
BAT_limited_diplomacy_desc:0 "As we pivot away from reclaiming Equestria for our goddess, we must lay the seeds of our success on Zebrica. We cannot forget why we are taking the steps in this great crusade, not for greed or gold; but for our goddess alone! The Nightmare needs us to secure these lands from the profligates and heretics, for only we can use its bounty for her righteous cause!"
BAT_pacification_brigades:0 "Form the Imperial Frontier Forces"
BAT_pacification_brigades_desc:0 "Our Legions dominate our enemies on the field of battle, but when a war ends; what then? When our first ancestors carved out modern day Chiropterra from the natives that sullied her soil, they formed dedicated units to keep the peace. We shall follow the lessons of this history and form our own Frontier Corps to serve, protect, and ensure the loyalty of our new territories."
BAT_strike_at_tobuck:0 "Strike Down the Savages"
BAT_strike_at_tobuck_desc:0 "The time has come for our strength to be shown to these heretics! Tobuck and Zarantia are lands without order and without faith, ruled by petty despots and barely worthy to be considered nations. We shall not underestimate the conniving warlords and their armies however. We shall treat them as if they were our greatest enemies, we shall pour our hearts and souls into this war! For the Legion! For the Nightmare!"
BAT_deal_with_the_warlords:0 "Woe To the Vanquished"
BAT_deal_with_the_warlords_desc:0 "The rogue warlords of the desert have been captured by our forces, now all that matters is to decide what to do with them. While there have been talks of simply executing the lot of them, the Legionary Council has met to decide their fate. The debate is expected to take several takes and require many interrogations, but the Nightmare is a just mistress; so we shall follow her example."
BAT_secure_tobuck:0 "Reorganise the Eastern Territories"
BAT_secure_tobuck_desc:0 "With the warlords dealt with, the resistance crushed, and the civilians pacified; we have done what none of the petty despots of the natives could...secured Tobuck. Now that our invasion is over, we must no longer be conquers; but rather protectors. Tobuck is our territory now, it is the territory of Nightmare Moon, and a valued part of her empire. We will not let it fall into disarray again."
BAT_cooperate_with_colthage:0 "The Enemy Of My Enemy..."
BAT_cooperate_with_colthage_desc:0 "Whoever rules the Colthaginian Empire matters little to us at this time. Despite their status as heretics with a maddening polytheistic pantheon, they have use to us as potential allies. The Hippogriffs are an imposing force and a danger to our great expansion. Much like how our ancestors fought in the Legions of old, we need somepony alongside us against the enemy."
BAT_help_their_military:0 "Assist the Colthaginians"
BAT_help_their_military_desc:0 "The Colthaginians are fighting with equipment captured from the Yetis and antiques carried by their fathers, it is time we enlighten them to the true power of the modern age; machine guns, rifles, and whatever else we can spare will be given to our fair weather friends in the hopes of granting them a fighting chance in the struggle ahead."
BAT_the_gamble:0 "Cast the Die"
BAT_the_gamble_desc:0 "Warzena lies just to our east and barely stands on a single leg. The Zebra nation will be enlightened to our righteous cause and we shall join them in our pact, but this cannot be done with the Hippogriffs hanging over their shoulder; whispering false notions of 'harmony' to them. We shall make our demands known and if the Hippogriffs dare stand against us? So be it."
BAT_prepare_two_pronged_push:0 "Operation Spit Roast"
BAT_prepare_two_pronged_push_desc:0 "War! The Hippogriffs have made their intentions clear and justified our operations! While the battles rage across Zebrica, we must coordinate with our ally to the East! Coordinated offensives from both sides will disorient and weaken our foe. Peace will only come when Chiropterrans and Colthaginians stand shoulder to shoulder against the great, harmonic menace! Forward, to victory!"
BAT_strike_them_down:0 "Push the Hippogriffs Back Into the Sea"
BAT_strike_them_down_desc:0 "Stand firm! The Hippogriffs once thought that their strength would drive us into the sea? The Nightmare laughs at their insolence, for now we turn to face them with all our might! Greater enemies have died by our hooves and greater enemies shall fall in our future! These Hippogriffs shall be driven back into the sea!"
BAT_fighting_on_the_homefront:0 "Sway The Old Guard"
BAT_fighting_on_the_homefront_desc:0 "The conquest of new lands does not mend the failures of Operation Moonshine, this is clear. In hushed whispers and worried glances, the old families speak of the Legionary Council simply trying to mend their failure with smaller gains. Perhaps they are right? But their attitudes need to change. Lord Commander Autumn Breeze shall host a gala at his plantation, the Council hopes that the patriarch of Clan Reed can sway his fellow aristocracy back in line."
BAT_reorganize_local_governance:0 "Embrace State Capitalism"
BAT_reorganize_local_governance_desc:0 "The competition that capitalism breeds weeds out the weak and unsustainable businesses, but sometimes a guiding hoof is needed to ensure that the country's economy charges forward without the meddling of businessponies. Our economy shall sustain itself, we shall not hide it any longer! While we may not offer the same stock options, we can certainly guarantee that the state's businesses are too big to fail."
BAT_reorganize_agriculture:0 "Reorganise the Agricultural Sector"
BAT_reorganize_agriculture_desc:0 "Our agricultural sector has been weakened by the strain of war. Each success and each failure consumes valuable ponypower and supplies, hemorrhaging our food supplies over time. By mechanizing our farms the same way we have some of our military divisions, we can not only free up more bodies for the industrial sector or front; but also increase our available food supply!"
BAT_limited_unionism:0 "The Chiropterran Development Fund"
BAT_limited_unionism_desc:0 "By expanding our allocations to the industrial sector with a larger development fund, we are investing in our future success! Although it may harm us financially now, but pouring money into greater industrial research and companies we can improve the compliance and effectiveness of industry at all levels."
BAT_army_development:0 "The Military Industrial Complex"
BAT_army_development_desc:0 "The industry required to sustain our massive military build-up can only be met by government subsidies into industry itself. To keep our military top of the line, we embrace this unique balance between industry, research, and government against the critics who warn of tying our commercial assets even deeper without military forces. With this change, we will be able to research more and choose which projects best suit our force."
BAT_labourer_leasing:0 "Labourer Leasing"
BAT_labourer_leasing_desc:0 "Although Labourers belong to the state, sometimes there are simply too many for the state to use on all projects. Because we have an overflow of labourers, it only makes sense that we allow what few foriegn companies on our soil and local businesses to lease this free labour from us...at a reasonable tax of course."
BAT_the_propaganda_machine:0 "Hearts and Minds"
BAT_the_propaganda_machine_desc:0 "Operation Moonshine might have failed, but Chiropterra has not! Our recent battles have given our propaganda machine all the film, features, and pictures it needed to drum up its messaging for the first time in centuries. We do not have to look back to our ancestors alone for heroes anymore, for there are living legends among us now! Crowds line up at recruiting offices for blocks after newsreels show our brave Legionnaires on the front."
BAT_expand_civilian_governance:0 "Expand Local Civilian Governments"
BAT_expand_civilian_governance_desc:0 "The Legionary Council might act as our supreme authority, but it would be foolish to have them weigh in on local district disputes and the laws of small towns. By expanding the power of our local government officials, we can encourage greater participation in government while expanding our power simultaneously!"
BAT_remember_your_duty:0 "The Thousand Year Struggle"
BAT_remember_your_duty_desc:0 "It has taken time and effort to remind our people of our duty. One cannot blame them for losing faith, for they struggled for a thousand years preparing for their triumph. As one generation passes onto the next though, we have rekindled the flames of patriotism within them all. The first great steps on another thousand year struggle have been made and they all take pride in being at its forefront."
BAT_new_settlement_initiative:0 "New Settlement Initiative"
BAT_new_settlement_initiative_desc:0 "As we expand our territory east, we also must consider the land we have. In the past, it was hard to create new settlements or even move away from the larger population centers of cities. With increased automation and greater infrastructure, it has become feasible to settle even the most desolate parts of Chiropterra with permanent settlements. This new initiative will encourage our people to settle in these new homes and enjoy the comforts of modernity there."
BAT_youth_service_corps:0 "Form the Youth Service Corps"
BAT_youth_service_corps_desc:0 "The Nightmare does not need to inspire the loyalty of the faithful, for they are already in her embrace. She must enkindle the love of the foals to ensure that the future is in her name. The establishment of the Youth Service Corps will lead to the betterment of our young ponies and inspire future generations of loyal, dependable, and honest Chiropterrans."
BAT_expand_operations:0 "Expand the Hoof's Operations"
BAT_expand_operations_desc:0 "The Hoof of the Nightmare must grow as we have. While our traditional intelligence agency has been with us since our first landings, there have been few innovations in their conduct of operations on domestic soil. While they remained on the bleeding edge of foriegn espionage, by granting them greater power in Chiropterra itself we can expand their support of the state here."
BAT_the_war_at_sea:0 "The War At Sea"
BAT_the_war_at_sea_desc:0 "The largest border Chiropterra has is with the ocean, meaning that we must have a capable navy to defend ourselves with. By reviewing our current doctrine and comparing it with other developments from our own expeirences and that of others, we can expand our naval knowledge far beyond our current capabilities. What took others years will only take us months for the Nightmare guides us with her shadow!"
BAT_develop_the_shipyards:0 "Shipyard Expansion Scheme"
BAT_develop_the_shipyards_desc:0 "While we are guided by the Nightmare, we also must be aware of our capabilities. The shipyards of Chiropterra will be modernized to not only rival that of our enemies, but surpass them! Our ships shall be remembered for centuries and their legacy will rule the waves around us! In a thousand years, the weight of our naval power shall crash against our true enemy! For now we will sharpen our fangs on the prey we find around us."
BAT_improve_the_submarine_fleet:0 "The Seawind MKII"
BAT_improve_the_submarine_fleet_desc:0 "Effective, hard to detect, and dangerous; it is easy to see why the Legionary Council has favored the development of the submarine. Our current hulls are out of date and if we wish to have our wolfpacks be the most dangerous in the sea, we will have to give them the tools to be successful!"
BAT_improve_the_destroyers:0 "The Moonfire MKII"
BAT_improve_the_destroyers_desc:0 "Cheap, maneuverable, and swift; it is also easy to see why the Council favors this surface ship. Although not as effective at raiding as our submarines, our destroyers are ancient in comparison to that of our enemies. New hulls and new guns mounted on them will make our surface fleet stronger. It is wiser to start at the ground up for retrofits with the support ships rather than starting with the battleships afterall."
BAT_fuel_conservation:0 "Fuel Conservation Initiative"
BAT_fuel_conservation_desc:0 "As we improve our naval capabilities, we will also need to allocate a greater stockpile of fuel to the surface and submarine fleets. Although this is a daunting task, it has a simple solution; expand the reserves. By constructing additional fuel silos, we can increase our total storage capacity ensuring an availability of fuel during long term operations."
BAT_the_lunar_marines:0 "Form the Imperial Marine Corps"
BAT_the_lunar_marines_desc:0 "Our enemies shall be placed under siege! Under lockdown! The Nightmare's Imperial Marines will storm their ranches, homes, and liberate them from the heels of their masters! Our marines are merciless, dangerous, well-oiled machines that will land on their shores without warning."
BAT_convoy_raiding:0 "Supply Line Disruption Tactics"
BAT_convoy_raiding_desc:0 "We cannot match the operation range of our surface fleet with that of our enemies, therefore we shall dedicate most of our efforts to our reliable raiding groups. While the waters around Chiropterra shall be secured, we shall cause havoc upon the enemy wherever their ships sail in the ocean! Their will be no escape from our hunt!"
BAT_operation_range_expansion:0 "Long Distance Operations"
BAT_operation_range_expansion_desc:0 "Our surface fleet needs to go past our shores, to be able to meet the enemy anywhere they are found. While we cannot simply take over every island between here and Equestria to build up a series of naval bases, we can instead focus on improving our doctrine with the capabilities we have to greater expand the flexibility of our operations."

BAT_look_to_the_economy:0 "A Failure On the Homefront"
BAT_look_to_the_economy_desc:0 "We have failed in our efforts, but we cannot hold only the Legionnaire responsible. Our homefront was just as critical to Moonshine as our soldiers were. We must prepare for our next crusade and build an economy that is able to support it, even if it takes another thousand years to prepare."
BAT_strenghten_the_commission:0 "Tighten the Grip"
BAT_strenghten_the_commission_desc:0 "The treatment of our native Labourers has been too relaxed. The restraints on the Commission allowed for silent protest and 'protections' among the few dissidents there were. We must tighten our hold over this critical part of the economy and not allow even one soul to think of anything beyond service."
BAT_intensify_raids:0 "Calibrated Acquisition Operations"
BAT_intensify_raids_desc:0 "Our raiding parties will be equipped with our most modern equipment and soldiers. We cannot afford to limit ourselves in these missions anymore, by diverting more resources to each raid we should be able to enjoy greater returns on the labourers acquired."
BAT_free_reign_to_LMRD:0 "LMRD Test Subject Procurement Standardisation"
BAT_free_reign_to_LMRD_desc:0 "The LMRD is an invaluable asset to Chiropterra and we cannot throttle their need for test subjects anymore. We shall finally grant them free reign to take whichever labourers they require for experiments without the need for approval from the Native Affairs Commission."
BAT_control_collars:0 "Behavioral Correction Collars"
BAT_control_collars_desc:0 "Behavioral Correction collars have a simple, but deadly design. A small explosive charge is encased in five pounds of durable steel. A microphone and a radio wave receiver and transmitter allow for the location of labourers to be monitored along with their conversations. Need be, the collars can be detonated remotely."
BAT_work_for_your_bread:0 "Food Ration Standardisation"
BAT_work_for_your_bread_desc:0 "One of our founders a thousand years ago wrote a simple directive as we established ourselves; if one works, one eats. We shall apply this straightforward directive to our labourers who will only be given their rations after they have performed their allotted duties for the day. Those who do not work, do not eat."
BAT_dedicated_research_centers:0 "Special Access Zones"
BAT_dedicated_research_centers_desc:0 "The LMRD and Native Affairs Commission have presented a bold new research strategy, aimed at collecting large units of data at once from an enclosed population. By combining a labourer barracks and worksite into one 'Special Access Zone', we can completely restrict their movement and allow the LMRD to observe them as they work."
BAT_reforming_the_commission:0 "The Velvet Glove"
BAT_reforming_the_commission_desc:0 "To even deny one part of our population the benevolence of the Nightmare's sacred reign is sowing the seeds of our own destruction. We cannot allow the Native Affairs Commission to continue in its current state and we must examine our treatment of the labourers. We must follow our Empress' example, we must improve."
BAT_mandatory_temple_attendence:0 "Mandatory Moonday Attendance"
BAT_mandatory_temple_attendence_desc:0 "The Labourers had always been given the option to attend services at our temples, for faith is something that cannot be forced. By making temple attendance mandatory, we aim to provide them with a spiritual outlet and provide a dedicated day of rest in their week of labour. It is our hope that in time the exposure to the temple and holy word will passively convert many."
BAT_the_one_generation_rule:0 "The One Generation Rule"
BAT_the_one_generation_rule_desc:0 "A child shall not be punished for the sins of their father, is that not what the Moonspeakers say? We will adapt our laws and allow the children of Labourers who convert to the true word of the goddess to be equal citizens in one generation, instead of two. If their parents are truly faithful, so too will their children be!"
BAT_improve_working_conditions:0 "Labourer Lodgings Improvement"
BAT_improve_working_conditions_desc:0 "Home is where the heart is and if one's home is two sheets of tin without running water, one's heart is not going to be its work. It is only logical that we provide basic living conditions to our labourers, for they are not slaves; only wayward souls we are attempting to save."
BAT_accountable_overseers:0 "Limit Physical Punishment"
BAT_accountable_overseers_desc:0 "The whip is a tool of weaker ponies, we will be smarter and stronger than that. The overseers of our Labourers must be held to the same standard as any other citizen of Chiropterra. By limiting their legal ability to inflict physical punishment, we predict a sharp decline in cases of Labourers perishing in hostile working conditions."
BAT_decent_living_quarters:0 "Loyalty Shall Be Rewarded"
BAT_decent_living_quarters_desc:0 "For those that work without incident and are faithful to Nightmare Moon, why not allow them luxuries? There is no reason to deny a labourer access to books or a permit to reward hard labour? Why not even grant those that push past their quotas a chance to keep what they earn for profit? There are many reforms we will make and all will reward the loyal."
BAT_additional_labourer_acquisition:0 "Additional Labourer Procurement"
BAT_additional_labourer_acquisition_desc:0 "Raids are violent and prone to failure, but they are not the only way to procure labourers. Our agents will begin operations to direct refugee ships towards our waters or even find those desperate enough to volunteer for a new life in the mythical Chiropterra for the Nightmare."
BAT_the_carrot_and_the_stick:0 "No Place For Cruelty"
BAT_the_carrot_and_the_stick_desc:0 "Cruelty is inefficient. It is an emotional and wasteful expression of weaker ponies and their false ideologies. We must embrace this fact. We shall enable those who enforce our law better means to control our population through more benevolent means under the philosophy of the carrot and the stick."
BAT_harsher_conditions:0 "Harsh Yet Fair"
BAT_harsher_conditions_desc:0 "We will look to reform our justice system, but in doing this our laws will be harsher. All the same, they will be much more fair. No pony is above the laws of the Nightmare, no one sentient creature will stand above others. Justice is blind, but the Nightmare is not!"
BAT_service_for_freedom:0 "Freedom Through Service"
BAT_service_for_freedom_desc:0 "Service guarantees citizenship! Labourers of Chiropterra rejoice! All who serve for their committed time in the Legions of Nightmare Moon will be granted their freedom at the end of their term. Those who are wounded or medically discharged with honors will be placed in auxiliary battalions, but are still eligible. Are you doing your part for a better future?"
BAT_use_our_connections:0 "The Underground Economy"
BAT_use_our_connections_desc:0 "Let us not pretend that there is an economy in the world that runs beneath the shadows of every state. As children of the darkness, we will thrive in it. Our agents shall expand our connections into these illegal markets and shell corporations to greatly increase our assets."
BAT_equipment_smuggling:0 "Gray Market Contacts"
BAT_equipment_smuggling_desc:0 "As we press into the underground economy, we shall enjoy the fruits of our labours. Several shipping companies from Haukland and Skyfall shall begin to loose shipments in international waters along the coast of Saddle Arabia, but their shared insurance conglomerate Lunar Protections will always reimburse them handsomely."
BAT_the_poppy_fields:0 "The Poppies Of Love"
BAT_the_poppy_fields_desc:0 "Praise be to Nightmare Moon and the bounties of her harvest. Chiropterra is a harsh environment, even by Zebrican standards. This however does not stop the cultivation of our crops, including that of the poppy plant. We can extract valuable medicine from the poppy plant such as morphine, but we also must acknowledge its volatile recreational purposes..."
BAT_literal_drug_smuggling:0 "Drown Their Markets"
BAT_literal_drug_smuggling_desc:0 "While our own ponies will benefit from the sale and cultivation of the poppy plant, we shall drown our enemies in cheap, dangerous opiods. Our goal is not profit, but proliferation. We shall sink the claws of addiction and strife deep into our enemy's most vulnerable and spread like a disease from them."
BAT_shell_companies:0 "Shell Company Procurements"
BAT_shell_companies_desc:0 "Our contacts in the grey markets have solidified different sectors of control. Sanctioning a few small squads of infiltrators, we shall secure the last few 'signatures' we need to gain full control of several different companies. Through these our reach will be greater and even more hidden."
BAT_extract_equestrian_experts:0 "Equestrian Academic Extraction"
BAT_extract_equestrian_experts_desc:0 "Several Equestrian academics are researching different projects that interest us. By staging several honeypot operations and the occasional disapperance we can siphon off the best and brightest of our heretical enemies with them being none the wiser."
BAT_electronics_development:0 "The Colossus"
BAT_electronics_development_desc:0 "Through the use of vacuum tubes and other electronic marvels, we can develop an electronic machine that can compute certain equations and ciphers for us! Our leading electronics experts predict massive leaps and bounds in processing ability and power with newer models of the Colossus as well!"
BAT_calibrate_military_industry:0 "Bolster Military Production"
BAT_calibrate_military_industry_desc:0 "More factories means more guns. More guns means more soldiers. The math here is rather simple, but we will have to commit time to consolidate our national assets to refocus on military production. Once we pool our resources, we will be able to enjoy the benefit of more factories, which means more guns...et cetera, et cetera."
BAT_synthethic_oil:0 "Coal Liquefaction"
BAT_synthethic_oil_desc:0 "CTL or Coal to Liquid Fuels is a process in which coal is, rather obviously, converted into fuel. Although this method of synthesis has been around for several years, we have yet to fully invest in the ingenuity of the idea. By embracing this new method of accessing critical fuels, we can bolster our reserves."
BAT_mining_mechanisation:0 "Mining Mechanisation"
BAT_mining_mechanisation_desc:0 "A machine can two twice the work of an average pony, save for a few anomalous earth ponies among our miners. Be that as it may, by mechanizing our mines we can extract more, dig deeper, and enjoy a much larger return from them."
BAT_improve_logistics:0 "Improve Inter-District Infrastructure"
BAT_improve_logistics_desc:0 "It is time we examine the state of our roads between districts, meaning that we must take drastic steps to improve infrastructure throughout our country. By building onto existing railroads and roads, we can create a comprehensive Inter-District travel network that enables mobility of our citizens but also critical logistics."
BAT_developmental_effort:0 "Academic Modernisation"
BAT_developmental_effort_desc:0 "The universities of Yale or the School of Magic in Equestria will have nothing on our academies, once we finish modernizing them of course. It is no secret that our isolation forces us to be creative, but it also hobbles our ability to stay ahead of the curve academically. By granting more funding to our institutions of higher learning, we can benefit from their knowledge."
BAT_medical_research_development:0 "Inter-District Medical Network"
BAT_medical_research_development_desc:0 "By expanding state control of hospitals and other medical facilities, we can ensure they are staffed by properly trained doctors with the most modern equipment possible. Any citizen or labourer in need of medical attention will recieve it in new, start of the art facilities. The health of our ponies is the health of our nation."
BAT_crop_diversification:0 "Diversify and Specialize"
BAT_crop_diversification_desc:0 "Diversification is the process of allocating capital in a way that reduces the exposure to any one particular asset or risk. Or while specialization is the allocation of capital into one particular asset for the greatest reward. We will find the balance between both with our new Industrial Fund, dedicated to allocating grants to different parts of our economy."
BAT_coconut_crab_ranching:0 "Coconut Crab Ranching"
BAT_coconut_crab_ranching_desc:0 "The Coconut Crab is the largest land animal with an exoskeleton that does not use magical means for its survival. These large creatures were common in Chiropterra and have been hunted for centuries for their meat, nearly to the point of extinction. By expanding our protection of the crabs and allocating many more to sanctioned ranches, we can cultivate them safely."
BAT_a_life_of_luxury:0 "Luxuries For the Masses"
BAT_a_life_of_luxury_desc:0 "As our economy becomes more and more efficent, our experts have found startling accounts of surplus and excess. We are out producing our projections for the next century, meaning that we can afford to shower our ponies with commercial goods and luxuries."

BAT_examine_military_procedures:0 "Examine What Went Wrong"
BAT_examine_military_procedures_desc:0 "We have failed to bring the Eternal Night and Nightmare Moon remains lost to us, but we cannot give up hope! We must think back to our ancestors when they first arrived on these shores, we must follow in their example and lay the groundwork for the next war. Even if it must be in another thousand years."
BAT_new_officers_from_equestria:0 "Welcome the New Exiles"
BAT_new_officers_from_equestria_desc:0 "With the failure of Operation Moonshine, we must arrange for a withdrawal of significant assets from Equestria. There is a silver lining in that the officers we embedded into the Equestrian military can now return to us with their experiences and sympathizers."
BAT_support_squads:0 "Auxiliary Combat Role Training"
BAT_support_squads_desc:0 "Our Auxiliaries cannot be wasted on menial tasks anymore! Some of our most loyal units comprise of Auxiliary forces, therefore we must integrate them wholly into the Legions. Separate support companies mixed in with regular troops will give our frontline units greater flexibility."

BAT_ranger_corps:0 "Her Imperial Majesty's Legionary Ranger Corps"
BAT_ranger_corps_desc:0 "We must develop a dedicated light infantry corps to better improve the lethality of our divisions. It is with this course of action that we open our first 'Ranger' school in the Howling Hills region. We shall test candidates' mental, physical, and martial prowess in order to form a specialized ranger corps that can be integrated with our main infantry units.
BAT_equipment_modernisation:0 "Equipment Modernisation"
BAT_equipment_modernisation_desc:0 "The world around us is rapidly evolving with major technological advancements made in a matter of months rather than years. We cannot afford to fall behind. It is too costly and time consuming to consistently rely on espionage to acquire new equipment for us to copy, so we must subsidize our own researchers to improve upon our own equipment."
BAT_legacy_of_the_shadowbolts:0 "Legacy of the Shadowbolts"
BAT_legacy_of_the_shadowbolts_desc:0 "The Shadowbolts were a dedicated flying formation from the first coming of Nightmare Moon known for their ferocity in the skies! Their night flying is legendary and their accomplishments in the skies even greater! We shall look to their memory as we develop our flying corps capabilities, our new planes and doctrine will echo their legacy!"
BAT_troop_support:0 "Combined Arms Tactics"
BAT_troop_support_desc:0 "The use of combined arms represents the future of warfare. Coordinated assaults of infantry, artillery, and armor to destroy the enemy in quick, decisive attacks will win us our next war. Gone are the days of wasteful tactics and mass infantry attacks without proper support, this new doctrine will pave the way to victory with overwhelming firepower."
BAT_new_bombercraft:0 "Strategic Destruction"
BAT_new_bombercraft_desc:0 "In war we are not just fighting military forces anymore, we are fighting nations. Every city is an asset, every civilian in it a labourer for their war effort. Some on the Council might not approve of this new approach to warfare, but we must strike at all assets of the enemy in order to end a war as quickly as possible by bombing the enemy into absolute submission."
BAT_the_fuel_issue:0 "The Imperial Strategic Petroleum Reserve"
BAT_the_fuel_issue_desc:0 "We are a small nation and our resources can easily be stretched thin in a prolonged conflict, why even our economy now is reliant upon fuel. Our limited contact with the world at large means that we cannot so easily acquire it either. By opening a series of synthetic plants and establishing a means to store vast quantities of oil for long periods of time, we can prepare a vast reserve for military use."
BAT_army_motorisation:0 "Legionary Mechanisation"
BAT_army_motorisation_desc:0 "There is a tribe of warriors on Zebrica that can march fifty miles a day and still fight, but they are only carrying spears and shields. A modern soldier carries much more and his support unit's wagons. We must fully motorize our military so that we can move a hundred fifty miles a day and fight with the full force of our modern Legions!"
BAT_armoured_trains:0 "Armoured Trains"
BAT_armoured_trains_desc:0 "Railways are the backbone of our logistics no matter the amount of trucks we may have. It is important that we provide this critical asset of military infrastructure with the means to defend itself. By implementing the use of armored trains, we cannot only improve the defense of our logistics but also some units dedicated to protecting railways to be used elsewhere."
BAT_extensive_planning:0 "Strategy in Depth"
BAT_extensive_planning_desc:0 "Tactics are the plans at the smallest unit level and srategy is at the highest, but their overall goals must align for success. Our strategic mission in any military campaign or operation must be clear so that commanders on all levels understand its intent."
BAT_military_logistics_department:0 "Legionary Logistics Corp"
BAT_military_logistics_department_desc:0 "An army marches on its stomach, or so the saying goes. With the adoption of vehicles, modern weapons, and other tools of warefare; an army marches on its stomach and fights with whatever the motor pool can provide. Our improved Logistics Corps shall ensure that our army has whatever it needs wherever it needs it."
BAT_joint_chiefs_of_staff:0 "Joint Chiefs of Staff"
BAT_joint_chiefs_of_staff_desc:0 "Only a fool would have different branches of our military compete with one another for supplies or resources, but we are limited in who we can provide with what. By adopting a Joint Chiefs of Staff to inform the Legionary Council of the different branches' needs, we can better organize and coordinate their efforts with the goal of the state."
BAT_psychological_warfare:0 "Psychological Warfare"
BAT_psychological_warfare_desc:0 "All soldiers are susceptible to manipulation, even our own. While our propaganda will remind the Legions what they are fighting for, we shall invest heavily into our own efforts to undermine our enemy's will to fight. It is useless to resist the will of Nightmare Moon and we are her chosen ponies. If the pamphlets do not convince them, the speaker systems will."
BAT_chemical_warfare_corps:0 "The LMRD Chemical Department"
BAT_chemical_warfare_corps_desc:0 "A detachment of LMRD scientists will oversee the training of the first and all future members of the Legion's Chemical Corps. These soldiers will be specialized in utilizing advances in 'tactical use' chemicals such as gas, white phosphorus, and herbicides across all branches of our military while also acting to counter any use of chemical weapons by our enemy."
BAT_blow_them_out:0 "Destruction From Afar"
BAT_blow_them_out_desc:0 "Every life of a Legionnaire is sacred in the eyes of our great goddess. We cannot afford to spend them in her honor with wasteful assaults or risky maneuver tactics taken from heretical bugs. We instead will embrace a doctrine over overwhelming and superior firepower. It is our hope that once our artillery is done with a position that the infantry will simply have to sweep the enemy out of the crater."
BAT_legionary_operational_integrity:0 "Operational Integrity"
BAT_legionary_operational_integrity_desc:0 "Gone are the days when generals commanded nearly every aspect of a battle. Instead, our commanders will now pass on their plans and intent to subordinates. Those subordinates will do the same down the chain of command. At each level the officers will be able to pursue their own means to completing their respective objectives with disciplined initiative."
BAT_artillery_reliability:0 "Concentrated Fire"
BAT_artillery_reliability_desc:0 "The harder the fighting and the longer the war, the more the Legions lean on its gunners. Our artillery is the King of battle fit for our Holy Empress. We must ensure that the tools of our gunners are reliable as they are on the field of battle. Our Moonspeakers shall bless their shells and our ordnance shall rain the Nightmare's righteous fury from them."
BAT_mobile_warfare_conception:0 "The Batton Plan" #Yes I too want to die for this pun
BAT_mobile_warfare_conception_desc:0 "General Batton's insistence on a flexible, mobile army has lead to his personal development of a new doctrine for the Legions. Hoofcrafted, the 'Batton Plan' copies much from the Changeling school of warefare, but makes modifications that focus on the sustainability of maneuver warfare. If we were to fully commit to this plan, Batton insists our force could be entirely motorized in a matter of years."
BAT_develop_tank_models:0 "Adapt Stalliongradian Blueprints"
BAT_develop_tank_models_desc:0 "The godless heathens in Stalliongrad do not make the best tanks, but they are easy to manufacture and replace. They are also receptive to bribes and are more then willing to lose a few...examples. By adopting the Stalliongrad designs and doctrine, we will gain from the benefit their tanks offer; ease of manufacturing, utility, and numerical superiority."
BAT_develop_anti_tank:0 "The Stanchion"
BAT_develop_anti_tank_desc:0 "The Stanchion is a modern anti-tank rifle that gives its user the power of an anti-tank gun in the power of their hooves. Early trials are promising with live fire demonstrations coming in a matter of months. The ammunition the tank weapon uses can be altered as well depending on the range, target, or environment; all around a promising and unique weapon for our Legions' arsenals."
BAT_replacable_parts:0 "Material Standardisation"
BAT_replacable_parts_desc:0 "We adopted Stalliongradian tanks because of their easily replaceable parts, why not extend this idea to all of our military? By ensuring that reliability and ease of repair is uniform for all our materials, it will become easier to maintain our Legion's lethality during protracted conflicts."
BAT_heavier_tanks:0 "Breakthrough Tactics"
BAT_heavier_tanks_desc:0 "Our lighter tanks exceed our expectations with maneuverability, but they do not meet our needs to overcome deeply entrenched enemy positions. Sometimes one cannot simply drive around the enemy, therefore we must invest in developing a heavier model of tank that can drive through the enemy."
BAT_the_power_of_massed_assaults:0 "All the Little Ponies"
BAT_the_power_of_massed_assaults_desc:0 "The average machine gun fires hundreds of rounds per minute, but every enemy machine gun has a finite amount of ammo and a limited field of fire. With the blessings of the Nightmare, we cannot fail in overcoming this mortal obstacle. If it fires hundreds of rounds, we shall send thousands of ponies! We will crash upon our enemy like a wave in concentrated assaults!"
BAT_modern_assault_tactics:0 "Stormtrooper Tactics"
BAT_modern_assault_tactics_desc:0 "The Griffonian heretics and their meagre empire have developed an interesting infantry doctrine around 'Infiltration Tactics' and 'Stormtroopers'. By allowing small detachments of our soldiers to survey and attack weak points in the enemy line, we can breakthrough where the enemy least expects us; just like the Stormtroopers of the Griffon Empire."
BAT_redemptionary_brigades:0 "Redemptionary Brigades"
BAT_redemptionary_brigades_desc:0 "Deserters, traitors, labourers, and any other dissidents who are willing to repent their sins shall be given the chance to find redemption through service in these special brigades. It might be cruel, but it is far more efficient to use them as a moving, fighting shield for our other units rather than simply execute them for their crimes."
BAT_combat_enhancers:0 "The LMRD Alchemical Department"
BAT_combat_enhancers_desc:0 "Methamphetamine hydrochloride when mixed with shamanistic positions creates a potent combat enhancement that keeps soldiers alert without the risk of a crash after. We shall encourage our soldiers to consume these enhancements and monitor their effects. These enhancements will be distributed to units in laced gum, chocolates, and tablets for consumption."
BAT_steal_the_bits_gun:0 "The Bits Gun"
BAT_steal_the_bits_gun_desc:0 "Although the Bits gun might look strange and according to reports nearly impossible to carry comfortably, our wayward enemies in Equestria have created a reliable weapon suited for all types of environments. An internal compartment inside the reciever prevents the submachine gun from jamming even after dipped in mud or sand.

Eternal was also not willing to use the new 'slide ruler' his grandson Lucent got him for his birthday.\n\nAllocating the labourers to their new professions based upon their old ones was hardly a trifling task either, but his equipment was slowing him down. It was rather ironic considering the stallion's age. His mind was sharp as ever, but his body had slowed to a crawl. The 'equipment' he used to secure his spot on the Legion Council had worn thin.\n\nEven armed with a new tool, Eclipse wondered if it would even be enough. He never denied his feebleness now, the matters of the military were best left to younger soldiers like Lucent after all.\n\nHe was just letting his frustration get the best of him, he would try to learn the slide ruler once Lucent came to visit for their afternoon tea. Eternal consoled himself that he was still useful as he reassigned two thousand, nine hundred, and thirty-three new labourers to their assignments across the munitions plants.

"If you're going to have to disappear, we're going to have a bit more fun first; just me and you."\n\nThe thestral slowly sauntered towards the record player, choosing a more modern Octavian piece as he took the burning ember of the cigar with his hoofs.

Ponies were hard to understand, prone to fits of emotion and irrational thought; even his own family was strained to care when he went on tirades about the numbers and mystical elements of crystals being harnessed for power..\n\nIt was in one of these impromptu speeches that Mystic first approached him, for the first time his grandstanding at a bar among his colleagues had a desirable outcome. She was perfect; she let him pick away at her mind, she picked away at his, and her love of physics was only rivaled by her attachment to him.\n\nIt was so easy with her, just like with math; being with her just added up.\n\nThe only downside was how much the mare traveled, but Bright could not bear to hold that against her. That was her job after all, even if it meant a visit to Zebrica every few months to ensure the relief organization she ran in Warzena was going well.\n\nMystic Belle was caring like that and Opal loved her all the more for it."

Gwedi never found himself proper in the temples for the goddess, but the sermons during the Festival were always around a dozen casks of the richest liquor they could find.\n\nWhen Lunar Hail stepped up onto an empty cask, Gwedi raised a healthy glass with every other soldier of Chiropterra following suit. The thestral priestess spoke with a fire and fury that would make even the most grizzled legionnaire blush. She promised an eternity in the night's embrace for those that died righteously in battle, a divine heaven with enough warm beds and partners for every soul that fell in her service.

The nightlife was fantastic, so much that the ponies of the other tribes participated in it. And with celebrations of Nightmare Moon's victory ongoing, it was more jubilant than ever. Arriving at the port, he saw his troops boarding their ships back home, content in their service to their Empress.

Both of them stared in silence for a moment out at the view of Manehattan, before Lucent cleared his throat and spoke, trying to break the tension, "Well, too bad we're leaving already.

No pony is looking forward to the discussion of why the nearly thousand year old plan failed, but to avoid a conflict with no solutions; four proposals to reform the military are being presented.\n\nThe first proposal is from Lord Commander Palisade and Major General Air does not see any major changes to the doctrine, but rather the introduction of new technologies into the force. Their argument is that the planning for Moonshine was not flawed, just its execution. Therefore, the solution is to keep our modus operandi  in long term planning for advanced operations and simply improve upon our means of executing plans at a more effective rate.\n\nThe next proposal is from Lady Commander Lightning Charm and Lieutenant General Brine. They propose an extreme change to the use of support units and artillery in our doctrine, favoring overwhelming firepower and the full integration of Auxiliary units to support it. Their solution to most military problems is to engage the enemy with such great quantities of firepower that our foes cannot retaliate.\n\nLieutenant General Batton and Brigadier General Eclipse present the third and most radical plan to the council. Their heated debates are famous, but their vocal and passionate commitment to a doctrine that focuses on mobility is widely seen as the only thing they agree on. They believe that by motorizing our Legions and making the focus of our advance on armored units, that we can outmaneuver our adversaries and achieve decisive victories. \n\nLady Commander Lunar Hail is well known for her piety in the holy Empress and advocates for a doctrine that she claims favors the goddess. By amassing large waves of soldiers for coordinated assaults, she believes that we can overcome any obstacle.

He might not be a thestral or pegasus with their wings, nor a unicorn with their fancy magic.\n\nBut Coffee Hays knew his guns and this here, new model Luna Rifle was about the strangest thing a Legionnaire ever plopped down on his desk and told him to figure out. \n\nNightmare's sake, the thing didn't even fire bullets; just charged bursts from a crystal! It didn't make a salt-lick of sense! How in the name of Tartarus did it even have recoil? There wasn't any cartridge being ejected?\n\nThe stallion's work on the weapon had taken weeks and a dozen different variants. Even when he copied the Luna Rifle part for part, it broke apart in his hooves. Either the weapon itself was shoddy or his work was, and the latter was near impossible. \n\nThings would change though! He finally figured out that by expanding the cooling ports along the barrel of the rifle, he could not only mitigate the recoil but allow the weapon to cycle through its crystal cartridges at a faster rate! It was a stroke of genius!\n\n"I just forgot the fact that if I didn't account for the magical discharge when removing the magazine, I risked burning my flank something fierce...which I did," Coffee Hays said with a shake of his head, sitting up a bit straighter as he offered a smile to the Legionnaire.

The character of "Legionary Captain Holden" being a prime example of subtle denouncement of the nation's policies towards the natives of Zebrica. In the novel he is portrayed as not personally believing in Nightmare Moon, but uses the faith of others to justify and encourage abhorrent crimes like scalp hunting.\n\nMcColty has denied any such intention and has encouraged readers to pull their own truths from the book.

Although they have defended themselves by claiming that their "bold and decisive" actions prevented the raiding party from being overrun, the sheer lunacy of their solution had to be addressed.\n\nWhen asked to explain why they were playing music of all things during the attack, the officers claimed that it helped "calm" down their own troops in the fight while also scaring "the Tartarus" out of the enemy.

Countries, upon centuries of disappearances compounded fewer and fewer souls are willing to come near us to investigate; further securing our isolation. \n\nThis system worked when battles were won with blood and iron, when feudal lords and their false gods ruled.\n\nIt does not work in a world of global trade, in a world of rapid technological advancement, and shared thought. We see the writing on the walls; radios, cars, and even the fringe rumors of crystal fusion. In a world that is constantly more connected by advancement and technology...\n\n...we cannot remain hidden forever.\n\nWe must make radical changes to our economy, the status quo can no longer sustain our great purpose!

Captain Lancer was tasked with testing the weapon's capabilities from a higher vantage point. The thestral followed all orders to a letter and decided that the best vantage point was in flight over the target.\n\nIt is hard to describe the surprise of the team when Captain Lancer fired the Stanchion prototype without even supporting it against a passing cloud. Suffice to say, the recoil broke the officer's shoulder and the fall shattered one of his wings. \n\nAlthough the lesson was invaluable to the development team and proved their theories on the weapon's recoil in flight to be correct, they wish to formally commemorate the officer that led them to these conclusions.

I am almost embarrassed to admit I hesitated, but it only took a moment to remind myself of Project Noctule's goal; a supersoldier.\n\nUpon further review of his record, several of his former superiors have reported a 'cruelty' towards the enemy.

I will admit it is a shame that Comet Flash was not a smarter stallion, he would have found the LMRD to be quite hospitable to his needs.\n\nAll things considered, Comet Flash has the best chance to physically endure the chemicals that have been prepared for the treatments.

Timberwolves proved too difficult to extract from the Everfree forest and the team sent to try capturing an Ursa Major never returned. Cockatrices have already proved their difficulty with their humiliation of New Mareland's military and were not considered.

The resulting suicides were a waste of valuable resources and the driving factor for our new security measures. \n\nTheir unfortunate loss has been beneficial in allowing me to force the Council's hoof in acquiring Hippogriff test subjects.

His simplicity is also constant; the stallion was not bright before the injections and he has not displayed any increased intelligence after them. Thankfully, there has been no visible mental degradation either. One of the researchers however came to me with a theory after we finished testing the subject today.\n\nAccording to her, we are witnessing mental stagnation rather than degradation.

Magic came easily to her, her power was exponentially increased, and a clear aura of energy grew around her...and she did not explode, which is a good sign in these matters. She performed in record strength for ten minutes before crashing, several minutes longer than untrained unicorns had.\n\nWhile our teams had found success in the use of morphine to dilute the compound, the brain death of several laborers made it clear that it was simply too strong a depressant. While pure alcohol dissolves most substances as a solvent, the crystal extract could persist easily within it. By combining the two, our teams created the 'Ubercrystal' injection that has led to Project Oaxaca's success. \n\nWhile most mages will be rendered exhausted following the use of the Ubercrystal, it is an effective tool or necessary last resort in our Legions' arsenal now. While the LMRD prepares to move into mass-production, I am pleased to report another successful project to the Council."

bat.46.d:0 "Following the completion of a field test this morning, it is safe to declare Project House Cat a success. Safe, however, is an objective phrase. Although the first Hydra brigade embedded into a supporting role performed admirably on the LMRD supervised exercise, it was not free of complications.\n\nThe first issue with the implementation of Project House Cat being the long gestation cycle of Hydras. While the Hydra itself grows to maturity rather quickly, the process of carrying the eggs to hatch is a long and complicated one. The size of the creatures and their danger do not allow us to mass produce the creatures in our current territory, meaning that there is a reasonable limit to how many Hydra we could bring into our forces.\n\nThe second issue is the logistics of maintaining the Hydra. Although we have figured out how to control them by collaring the alpha head, each one still requires nearly three platoons to handle the creature's daily maintenance in combat conditions. The amount of resources that would go into each Hydra brigade could easily fund several armored divisions.\n\nAt the end of the day, the LMRD has delivered once more to the Council its monster, even if the brigade leading it insists on it being called 'Mister Cuddlesworth.'"

bat.47.d:0 "Kinta was so close when the pegasus Legionnaire descended on him. The Zebra tried his hardest to fight back, but a malnourished worker barely bruised his oppressor. When Kinta Kunte was scraped off the ground by the overseers, he cried as he managed to see the ocean through the swelling in his eyes. He had almost reached the boats, almost made it out of this pit.\n\nHe was so close.\n\nThey secured him in holding cells outside of the Labourer's living spaces. The beatings they gave continued into the morning, not letting him escape even into the dreams of better days. By the time they dragged him from his cell, his left eye had swollen shut and he could not hear from one ear anymore. A pegasus officer, a pompous looking mare, was giving a speech to a crowd of Labourers that was assembled outside. Kinta recognized some of the Labourers.\n\nThey were Labourers who refused to fall in line and they all wore iron collars around their necks.\n\nThe officer gestured to him to stand and Kinta weakly rose to his hooves. An overseer roughly snapped a metal collar around his neck. The collar cut into his neck as Kinta swallowed and looked around slowly. A silence settled over the crowd and Kinta realized the officer had ended their speech, looking at the Zebra with an amused expression. "Labourer 24601...you tried to escape last night. You tried to escape the merciful embrace of the Nightmare. You have not earned your freedom yet...but you get to choose someone who can walk out that gate and be free."\n\nKinta opened his mouth to speak before the collar choked out his words before he could sound them out. His look of surprise must have been clear as the officer nodded their head again. "You get to choose one. Choose wisely."\n\nThe Zebra took a long, pained breath. He scanned the crowd for the youngest soul he could find, someone who had a full life to live ahead of them. A mare stood out among all the others. She was a lithe earth pony, with a black mane and sad blue eyes. He raised a hoof, pointing to her with a nod, "Her...let her be free, please."\n\nThe officer smiled and waved their hoof. A pair of overseers waded through the crowd of Labourers and lifted the pony from them. They let the mare step forward at her own, careful pace. She smiled at Kinta and the officer as she passed, stepping past the threshold of the open gate.\n\nAnd her collar began to beep...beep...beep.\n\nShe turned to run back into the gate, but the collar continued to beep...beep...beep. She pried at it with her hooves, she pleaded and cried to every god known to them. She fell onto her knees and begged the Nightmare for forgiveness. Then the collar exploded.\n\n"And now she is free," the officer said simply, kicking Kinta off the stage down where the mare used to be. "This is your warning! If you ever try to escape it will go off!""

bat.48.d:0 "Kinta Kunte rose from his first bed for the first time that morning.\n\nEven back home, among his friends and family in the fishing village they slept on simple cots. In the old Labourer's living quarters he had been forced to sleep on a rotting mattress with soiled blankets passed down from its previous occupants.\n\nAfter a few moments of appreciation he realized that he had forgotten to turn the radio by his bed off before he went to sleep. He frowned, but soon found himself amused at the novelty of the mistake. The tiny crackle of a moonspeaker delivering a morning sermon caused the Zebra to laugh for the first time since he had been forced to Chiropterra.\n\nHis new living quarters were similar to all the living quarters that the Labourers had now. It was a simple, small, three room apartment furnished with all the modern amenities he had only heard whispers about from the traders in his village; ovens, running water, electricity, radio, appliances...it was overwhelming.\n\nHe wondered if he was even bondage anymore.  The Labourers were paid now and there was reform in the works to even allow converts to obtain citizenship for themselves, to be free of what vestiges of slavery still hung around their gilded cage.\n\nThe Zebra paused as he slowly switched off the radio, the uncomfortable irony settling over him like a piss soaked rag; it really was a gilded cage. He lived better in slavery to Chiropterra and their Nightmare then he ever did in Warzena in freedom.\n\nAs he ate a breakfast that he once thought was only reserved for the wealthy, he doubted his desire for freedom. He missed his family, he missed his life...but what was his life? He was a fisherpony in a small village, isolated along the coast. He was destined to die there, as his father did and his father before him...it would be a meagre life, but it was a free life? Wasn't it?\n\nKinta was so buried in his own thoughts as he left his apartment, he collided into one of his neighbors; knocking the poor mare off her hooves. "Nik...I am sorry."\n\nShe was a lithe earth pony, with a black mane and sad blue eyes that met his as he slowly helped her up. Her smile was warm and her voice soft, with an unfamiliar twang that hooked his attention, "Overwhelmed?"\n\n"Yes...it is..." Kinta looked around the hallway, confirming it was empty before lowering his voice to her. "Strange."\n\n"Strange?" the mare asked with an arch of her brow. She snorted out a low chuckle before offering her hoof. "It's likely to get stranger if more reforms pass, maybe even pleasant. Misty Eve, by the way...from Maregypt."\n\n"Kinta Kunte, from Warzena," the Zebra said with a small grin, her laugh bringing it out. "Going to the factory?"\n\n"No...I'm actually going shopping, if you can believe it," she answered with a clear amusement at the novelty of it. "You should join me.

She settled by the window for a time, looking out into the faint outline of the tobacco fields in the soft moonlight. Something was...different, different in the air and the incessant chatter of elderly nobility.\n\n"I know that look, Lady Leaf." Lucent Eclipse poked through the mingling horde of wealth and power to bother her. The stallion offered her a glass as he sipped from his own. "You scrunch your nose when you're onto something." \n\n"Rather bold of you, Brigadier General Eclipse," the mare mused over the rim of her drink as she took it from him. "Operation Moonshine failed. The Council has to keep the old blood in line for another thousand years need be, but do you notice it?"\n\n"I lack your perception, Auburn," Lucent replied with a shake of his head. The thestral was many things and sharp was never his forte. He made up for it with his heart, but having a heart was a hard thing in Chiropterra. \n\n"The relief, can't you feel it? No riots, no great wave of change...everypony in this room is comfortable with Moonshine failing because it means the burden is off their shoulders," Auburn explained. "They might not be happy it failed, but do not deny you haven't noticed the smiles. They're all content that they've done their part, ensuring the success of the next generation."\n\n"The next generation..." Lucent said as he scanned around the room slowly. "You notice anyone here our age? The band is about to play a rather nice song and I'm afraid if I ask anypony else to dance I'll break their hip."\n\nAuburn looked across the crowd of ponies packed into the ballroom hall of the estate. Young Labourers and servers walked by with drinks while junior officers stood guard in doorways and on balconies. The aristocracy, gray and wrinkled, danced the night away. They sent off Operation Moonshine with fine wine and hushed promises, each member of the Council celebrating its end. Even the virile General Batton leaned against some poor labourer mare whispering something that was probably crude or maniacal in her ear, but no amount of inebriation could hide the stallion's grey mane.\n\n"You're sharper than you used to be, Lucent," the mare finally said as she set the empty glass on the windowsill. She lifted her hoof to take his and slowly guide them towards the music. "Your subtlety could use some work. They still control the waves of change and you need to be patient."\n\n"Patience is a virtue that I still truly lack," he mused as they began the slow waltz, gliding across the ballroom. "We have reason to introduce reform now, meaningful change for everypony. A chance at a better Chiropterra. Why let them solely control the coming change?"\n\n"Because it is easier to ride a wave than fight against it," Auburn said with a shake of her head.

Or about the gaul you have walking into this office like you own the place?” The sitting Councilmember chastised his daughter lightly, waving a hoof for her to close the door. “Don’t let the servants hear a word of my girl having the tenacity of her father.”\n\n“You need to retire,” she stated flatly.\n\n“...I was being humorous when I commented on your gaul, but I’ll give myself a pat on the back for giving you the set of stones that makes you think you can come in here and make that demand,” Autumn said as he shot up from his seat, leveling a hoof at her.\n\n“Then understand I am making this demand because I love you,” she said at a measured, rehearsed pace. “Lord Commander Eclipse was only ten years your senior...and endured only half the sacrifices you have.”\n\n“And? Your point? Your mother, the Nightmare bless her soul, knew that I would be on the Council until they peeled my corpse off the meeting table. The only leave I ever took was when she was sick!”\n\n“And that is why you need to retire. You have given all you can to Chirropterra. At the rate you’re pushing yourself you won’t make it another ten years,” Auburn said as she put her hoof down. “Do you really think a young reformer like Lucent at the table will make your job any easier?”\n\n“I was wrong,” Autumn said, raising a hoof to rub at his face. “Your mother gave you that fire, maybe I just gave you my way with words.”\n\n“You also gave me your stubbornness,” Auburn said softly, moving at a slow pace to hug her father. “I would not come here and make this demand if it wasn’t the best decision for our family and for Chirropterra.”\n\n“...I’ll begin the necessary paperwork tomorrow, girl,” Autumn said as he patted her back lightly, breaking the embrace as he lowered himself back behind his desk. “First things first? There’s been a bottle of wine I’ve been saving for this occasion, let me give you one last order...go get it for me.”\n\n“Yes, Lord Commander,” Auburn replied with a gentle smile."

Firm Hoof said as she watched her daughter lower the rifle with a frown.\n\n"But I try!" Moonlight said angrily as she reloaded, pulling the bolt up-back-forth-down. "I just don't get it, how am I supposed to keep my eye open when there's an explosion right in front of my face?\n\n"By not fearing it," Firm Hoof said, hunching down by her side. "Raise the gun again, aim onto the target, steady..." she cautioned her. "Line up your shot, and don't jerk the trigger this time..."\n\nThe range was a bit on the smaller side, Firm Hoof would have preferred something bigger, but the location, a large open sand pit only ten minutes away from his new home, was unmatched. Along with the small brook nearby, the fruit trees as well as the fertile soil, she was happy to be here. This was a good place to raise a family and she could see why the previous owners had built their home here. They hadn't used this place as a range though. That probably was a part of why they had lost the fight against Chiropterra; weakness begat failure\n\n"And squeeze..." she told Moonlight, who obeyed and calmly squeezed the trigger, sending the bullet flying directly onto the target, striking only a couple of rings away from the bullseye."

bat.90.d:0 "Deep in the streets of New Ayacachtli, there lies a small bar, popular with Legionaries. In that bar, three glasses clinked together, as three friends gathered to celebrate their promotions. Crimson Wave sat beside his two subordinates, who had served with him from his first command. "Hard to believe how far we've come, I feel like we're barely out from the academy." Crimson said, still adjusting to his new uniform. "I'll say, I bet you've broken the record in terms of just how fast someone can move up the ladder. You make friends with a member of the council or something?" One of his friends commented, before taking another swig of his drink.\n\n"Oh don't be ridiculous, I'm just good at what I do, and that's something the Legion is eager to reward." Crimson responded, before taking a drink himself. "Don't undersell yourself, you put the fear of the nightmare into those heathens last engagement." His friend responded in turn. The group then proceeded to order another round of beer, glad to have some rest after a particularly difficult series of battles.\n\nWhile Crimson Wave had not broken any records, he had still been promoted at a fast pace. His motto, "Harsh but Effective" reflected his policy of command. He expected the very best from his soldiers and gave his best in return. While his ponies trained he would tirelessly study tactics and strategy, ensuring that every aspect of the upcoming battle was in the Legion's favor. This policy had earned him the respect, if not admiration of his Legionaries, and carried him up the ranks.\n\n"But really Crimson, you've gotta slow down and give the rest a chance." His friend said. "You'll be commanding the entire Legion in a few months at this rate." The other commented. "Don't be ridiculous, if I slow down then we'd be drowning in heretics by next week." The table erupted into yet more laughter, as the three continued to drink. And as their celebrations continued long into the night, Crimson Wave thought about the future."

But this wasn't some normal attack, there was no large force arriving, no army coming to wash away the Lunarsits. This was a precise raid, and there was only one possible target, Commanders Stone Palisade and Lightning Charm. Both Commanders were quickly rushed to a secure bunker beneath the camp by Legionnaires, unsure where the hostiles were, unable to track any movement through the base. As they reached the most secure part of the bunker, the door was locked, and the two of them barricaded inside.\n\nLightning Charm breathed a sigh of relief, in all her efforts of trying to enforce discipline within the army, it seemed to have broken down. No one knew what was going on. How many were in the camp? Why did they cut through a fence and then announce themselves with a red smoke grenade? Stone Palisade was pacing back and forth in the room while Lightning Charm pulled up a chair. As usual, Palisade maintained his stern appearance, even as the ceiling above him began to shake, and the air conditioning vent began to rattle. As Stone Palisade looked up to see this, he frowned and muttered, "Oh dear."\n\nDiving out of the way as the vent fell and a creature followed. Throwing himself behind a chair, Palisade ducked as Charm pulled her pistol and yelled, "Identify yourself intruder!" The creature stood, dusted himself off and said, "Ah great, I have you both in one place now!" As Stone Palisade heard the voice, he yelled out, "Hold fire Lightning!" Standing up, he looked at the "intruder" in the room, a disheveled Pegasus in a Chiropterran uniform, and he rolled his eyes. "Captain Silver." He began, "What in tartarus are you doing here?" Stirling Silver dusted himself off, pulled some papers from his coat, and responded casually, "Well Commander, I just wanted you to look at my proposal, that's all." Lightning Charm sat confused as Commander Palisade spoke to the creature who, most likely, set off the camp alarm in the first place, and butted in "Hold on, you know him Stone?" Stone Palisade turned, took a deep breath, and said, "Yes, this is Captain Stirling Silver. He's been "reminding" me for weeks now about his proposal to form a new commando unit. He broke into my office once already to put it on my desk, and I told him I would look at it." Stirling butted in, "But you hadn't gotten back to me, so I decided to speak to you again."\n\nLightning Charm straightened herself and looked the pegasus up and down, "Well, considering you broke into Commander Palisade's office, and now into this secure bunker, I'd say that you at least have some credentials as a commando. So, lay it on me, tell me your plan."\n\nStirling Smirked..." #Read up on how David Stirling convinced his superiors to found the SAS for this one, it's great

Behind him, Eternal entered carrying a clipboard, he circled around examining everything thoroughly.\n\n"That all Grandpa?" Lucent asked, "I can't see anything else." Eternal looked over the clipboard, squinted, and replied, "I think it is Lucent. We can start getting this all to the truck." Lucent smiled as he watched his Grandfather go over to one of the boxes, this is the thestral he's admired all these years, diligent, pragmatic, a public servant to rival the founders of his Ursa Legion. But now, he was out of one of his jobs. The NAC was being abolished, and they were clearing out the building. Lucent thought he had heard it was being made into a new temple. Not like New Ayacachtli needed any more of those...\n\n"Agh!" The grunt came low and guttural, as Lucent looked over to see his Grandfather clutching his flank, Lucent ran to him and asked, "What's wrong?" Eternal waved his grandson away, "It's... nothing. Just some wear on the old bones. And muscles... and well everything." He let out a hearty chuckle, but Lucent didn't laugh back. "Grandpa..." he said "Have you ever thought about taking a break from work?" Eternal stopped. "Lucent. This has been my life for years and years. I don't know if I'd be able to do anything else." He pulled over a chair and sat down, "I mean, I can't say I haven't considered it. But what would I do?" "Whatever you wanted to!" Lucent exclaimed, "You've done more than almost any citizen in this nation to help our goddess return. I'd say even more than that old Breeze even." Eternal waved his hoof dismissively at this, "It's true!" Lucent continued, "I think you really do deserve a break, for however long you need."\n\nEternal paused and thought, Lucent stood still as his Grandfather pondered his words. Eternal then stood up, walked over to Lucent, placed a hoof on his shoulder and said, "Alright. But I'm not doing this half way then. I'm retiring. You'll lead the Legion." Lucent stood shocked, "Retire? Really? I mean, if it is what you want, sure, but wow. I... I don't know if I am ready!" Eternal chuckled, "You said it yourself, I need a break. And also, I know you'll do great, Lucent. I have full trust in you." The two embraced and smiled at one another before Eternal began again, "Now come on, let's get all this stuff out of here.

They have gathered to read the most important document they have received this millennium. All eyes rest upon Lunar Hail, their Chief Moonspeaker, who had the honor to read the Goddess's words. Lunar stood, hooves shaking in anticipation, removed the hoof delivered letter from its orange envelope, held it up, and began to read:\n\n"To my most loyal Legionnaires; I can not applaud your efforts to restore to me my rightful Imperium enough. Your work for these many centuries as my most faithful servants has delivered unto us the most triumphant of victories. But now, the war is over, and I have new directives for my most loyal followers.\n\nThe native populations of Zebrica should more quickly be integrated for the stability and prosperity of the Empire.\n\nYour government should reform itself to be less reliant on the Legions. I will be needing their soldiers soon, and I would not want them to be distracted.\n\nTo prevent heresy and over-zealous dogma, the position of Chief Moonspeaker shall be reformed into a civilian role, accountable only to me.\n\nThe Native Affairs Commission shall be abolished. Its methods are no longer needed in the new Empire, though its role shall be filled in some other way.\n\nThe researchers of the LMRD are instructed to moderate their acquiring of test subjects, but continue their fruitful research.\n\nLastly, all loyal Legionnaires shall prepare themselves to conduct war in my name against the Empire's enemies in Zebrica, foremost being the dastardly Hippogriffs.\n\nSigned,\nEmpress Nightmare Moon"\n\nBy now, Lunar Hail was shaking all over. Slamming the letter upon the table, she declared, "The word of the Empress! Praise be! Let us waste no time in putting her decrees into action!" before flying out of the room. As the rest of the council gathered their thoughts, and pondered the letter's implications, Stone Palisade rose, adjusted his jacket, and said, "Well, you heard the Moonspeaker. Let's get to work.""

They knew what she must be going through right now, the Empress' directive would force her to resign either her post as Legion Commander or Chief Moonspeaker, as the Empress wanted a civilian priest to guide Chiropterra's faith. Lunar Hail entered flanked by two other ponies, the Lady Commander took her seat, and her entourage pulled up chairs behind her.\n\n"Hello everyone." Lunar Hail began, "Thank you all for being here to discuss my replacement. As while it saddens me deeply, the Empress' word is clear. I must surrender one of my posts. And so while I do this, I hope you would consider my preferred successors." Gesturing to her left, she said, "For Lord Commander, I nominate Brigadier General Leaf LeHay. He is a close friend of mine and would lead well in my stead." Then to her right, "For Chief Moonspeaker, this is Falling Star. An acolyte of mine who has recently returned from Equestria and has received theological guidance from the Empress herself." Lunar Hail took a breath, "But I leave it up to you, my brothers and sisters, which post I am to leave. For I have been unable to decide myself."\n\nEach Legionary Commander weighed their options, and began to discuss and debate with one another.\n\nOn one side, Commander Emerald Light has been a close friend of Lunar Hail for years, and wishes her to remain on the council so that they can keep their friendship healthy. Commander Lucent Eclipse, on the other hand, knows Falling Star. And knows her religious beliefs are far more moderate than the dogmatic Lunar Hail, so he as well wishes to keep Hail on the council.\n\nOpposing them is Commander Lightning Charm, she knows LeHay well, and respects him as a military commander far more than Lunar Hail, who leads with fervor, not discipline. Then, Commander Auburn Leaf, who knows Falling Star as well as Lucent, but knows her cause will be benefited by Lunar's brand of faith being the guiding force for the nation.\n\nThe only commander without an opinion seems to be Stone Palisade, and as he listens to the arguments, and two commanders seem to plan to vote on each side, he considers his options. As the debate starts to seem endless, he raps his hoof on the table for silence, opens his mouth and says..."

BAT_AUTUMN_BREEZE_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 31st of December, 942 in New Ayacachtli\n\n§YRank§!: Lord Commander Of The Nightmare Legion\n\n§YBiography§!: Baron Autumn Breeze III, one of the last scions of the venerable Clan Reed of Fillydelphia, whom a millenia ago were one of the first Equestrian noble families to recognize the righteousness of her Imperial Majesty Nightmare Moon's Rebellion, and although the first rebellion was a catastrophic failure Clan Reed never betrayed their Empress and as such were the first of her Majesty's loyal subjects to set off for the savage lands of Zebrica, and it was they who laid the foundations for the creation of Chiropterra those countless centuries ago.\n\nSince those dark days Clan Reed and by extension the Nightmare Legion they have been charged with leading have laid in the shadows; Slowly but surely laying the seeds of doubt that will one day lead to the return of the Empress and the destruction of Equestria.\n\nBut for now Autumn Breeze must attend to the matters of the present. He is a proud supporter of Chiropterra's noble traditions, and believes firmly that the way they have lived for a millennia will guide the nation on into the future. For when Nightmare Moon does return, it shall be the venerated Nobles of the Legions who shall spread her mandate, and none shall dare to stop them.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Kessel"
BAT_EMERALD_LIGHT_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 7th of Feburary, 965 in Firstport\n\n§YRank§!: Lady Commander Of The Silver Moon Legion\n\n§YBiography§!:There have been those who called Emerald Light a 'mad scientist', though she herself would refute the notion quite strongly, as would many others even though the reasoning might differ. Born - like so many others in Chiropterra - to two legionnaires, Emerald Light was something of an outcast in her martially oriented family. Her mind always sought deeper answers, and where her parents might want to teach her how to kill something, Emerald Light could only wonder how it lived, what made it tick, why, and how to change it.\n\nThis proclivity set her path not into the ranks of the Legions, but rather into the LMRD, where she quickly proved herself an excellent researcher. Her seniors remarked on her steel-trap mind, which seemed able to lock onto an issue and, to the exclusion of all other things, figure it out even if she had to simply brute force it. Additionally, her utter disinterest in office politics and goal-focused thinking made her reliable enough that - after a series of purges of the LMRD's ranks - she was a perfect candidate for heading the division when the old guard was dismissed.\n\nUnder Emerald Light, the LMRD flourished and turned its efforts to more and more radical experiments. They were after all the servants of Nightmare Moon, and half-hearted efforts had no place under her, and with the plethora of test subjects at their disposal, the sky was the limit, and any lingering shreds of ethics was the first thing discarded on this route. In time, her technocratic and apolitical disposition combined with her results made her a perfect fit for the role of commander of the Silver Moon Legion. Dividing her time between the LMRD and the Silver Moon Legion, her fascination with pushing the very limits of science - no matter what needed to be done - has remained. She does not consider herself mad though: madness leads to irrationality, and she holds rationality in highest regard. Neither do others: that would make her a victim of her own mind, an excuse few can stomach giving her after seeing what she is capable of do.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Kessel"
BAT_ETERNAL_ECLIPSE_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 6th of July, 929 in Ursagrad\n\n§YRank§!: Lord Commander Of The Ursa Legion\n\n§YBiography§!: Eternal Eclipse is somewhat of a legend in Chiropterra, though not the kind that foals are told stories about and play dress up as, but rather as the kind all know about and respect. For his entire 61 years of service, he has worked diligently and faithfully to carry out the will of Her Majesty, dutifully awaiting her return and working to further the cause of the Legions. After a 12 year stint starting in 986 as the Lord Commander of the Ursa Legion, he assumed his post as the chief of the Native Affairs Commission, running the program as any other he has led before, with calm efficiency, prioritizing pragmatic results over dogmatic orthodoxy. This reputation has earned him the unbridled respect of all the other Legionary commanders, who trust him to get things done when decisive action is needed. And because of his reputation of impartiality, he often smooths the ruffled fur between some of the other commanders.\n\nBut even legends must eventually come to an end, and so comes Eternal Eclipse's legacy, the one thing that many debate. With his age constantly in the back of his mind, Eternal has spent much of his time cementing his Legion's succession; becoming more and more preoccupied with his successor, his grandson Lucent Eclipse. While he is nearly as respected as his Grandfather, some worry about his more... reform-minded ideas. Lucent already runs the military affairs of the Legion due to his grandfather's advanced age and often ill health, setting him up as the unchallenged successor to the Legion his Grandfather has guided for years.\n\nWhatever the legacy of Eternal Eclipse's time at the head of the Ursa Legion may be, none can deny that he has done more than most to bring the dream of Her Majesty's return to fruition, and that he isn't the type of thestral to brag about it.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Kessel"
BAT_LUNAR_HAIL_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 3rd of Janurary, 969 in Moonspeaker Hollow\n\n§YRank§!: Lady Commander Of The Children of the Moon Legion\n\n§YBiography§!: The life of Lunar Hail started quite simply, born to a poorer thestral family in the Moonspeaker Hollow, they had no political power, no prestigious military position, and not much property to their name. Though what they did have, was their daughter. They confided in her their deep faith in the Nightmare and admiration for the Children of the Moon Legion, who her family saw as the most devout protectors of their nation. Lunar was always a sheepish child, upstanding and genuine, but often reserved. It seemed that Lunar Hail would continue this line, as a laborer for the entirety of her life, until one faithful night. When she was thirteen, her family found that she was not in the house one night, they found her asleep in a nearby forest grove, and when they brought her home, she began to speak of the things she had seen. She told her parents that she had seen a vision of Nightmare Moon's return, she didn't know when it would happen, but the vision was so glorious, that she knew what her cause in life must be, to help bring this event about, and so her journey into faith deepened.\n\nAs soon as she could, she began to study to become a moonspeaker, and then joined the Children of the Moon as a military chaplain. By this time, her parents had noticed a change in her, she had become more charismatic, she spoke with a confidence she had never had before, and could easily work crowds into a frenzy, especially when she was speaking on religious matters. With this, she quickly became a sought after preacher within her Legion. Often, officers far above her rank would request her to give sermons at meetings or dinners, which gave her entry into the halls of power. In the year 1000, the previous Chief Moonspeaker of the nation died of natural causes, and in his will, the Moonspeaker asked for his funeral sermon to be given by Lunar Hail. To many, this was as good as choosing a successor, and Lunar Hail became the nation's foremost preacher and prophet. Four years later, the Children of the Moon's Commander also died, and since Lunar Hail already held a high position in her Legion, it wasn't difficult to get the other officers and moonspeakers of the Legion to elect her their leader. And now, with a Legion in one hoof, and the nation's faith in the other, Lunar Hail sets forth to wage war to bring about the Nightmare's eternal Glory.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Kessel"
BAT_LIGHTNING_CHARM_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 12th of October, 950 in Firstport\n\n§YRank§!: Lady Commander Of The Firstborn Legion\n\n§YBiography§!: Lightning Charm is one of the Legionary Commanders whose life story has most prepared her for her current position. Born to soldiers, raised a soldier, and still proud to be a soldier. Lightning Charm has crafted her Legion into the most disciplined and professional of Her Majesty's forces and prides herself on leading what she considers the most elite of the Legions, though she would hesitate to say that to any of the other commanders' faces. She thinks of the Children of the Moon and their leader Lunar Hail as too zealous for his own good, Emerald Light as scraping up scraps that cost too much for what the military gets out of them, and has even said Autumn Breeze may be a bit too stuck up. But even if the other Commanders have heard this, they don't bother commenting. They know Lightning Charm always has Her Majesty's goals in mind, and that her criticisms are efforts to improve all the legions as much as she can. Even if they sting a little.\n\nLightning Charm brings a rigorous style of leadership to the Warmaster's office. The nation is run even more like an army than before, and everything is expected to run at full capacity, and if it doesn't, it will be reprimanded harshly. But through all her personal qualms, like all the other Legionary commanders, she has only one goal in mind: the ever-increasing glory of her Majesty Nightmare Moon.

BAT_STONE_PALISADE_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 18th of April, 957 in Metztunalia\n\n§YRank§!: Lord Commander Of The Starborn Legion\n\n§YBiography§!: If, six years ago, you would have asked any soldier of the Starborn Legion who their next Commander would be, none would have said Stone Palisade. Sure, he held a relatively high post in the Starborn Legion, attending to its work in the nation's eastern territories, but that was all. He was one more Legionary in a land with over one hundred thousand of those. Then came the Yetis.\n\nThe first sign of the Storm King's approach came from an agent of The Nightmare's Hoof in Maregypt, a horde was coming, massive airships that flew through the sky, and magic of thunder and frost. It was then that Palisade decided he needed to act, moving without orders to secure resources he began constructing defensive redoubts along Chiropterra's border, securing it against yeti attack. In this, he set up anti-air defenses, defensive chokepoints, citadels, mines, as well as defenses along the southern coast to defend against an invasion over the water. So when the time came, and the armies of the mighty Storm King arrived upon the borders of Chiropterra, Stone Palisade'  s defiant defenses and his legion stood ready to turn them back. \n\nBut no attack came, as when the Storm King looked upon this "Nightmare Line" as Palisade had called it, he deemed the land too much trouble to attack and simply moved further north. After this, Palisade was called to New Ayacachtli for an unknown reason. He himself has told close confidants that he feared he would be reprimanded for acting without orders or even face some worse punishment, but he would be proven wrong. For when he arrived in the city, he was asked to meet with the Commander of his legion, and what he was told is unknown to this day. We know though, that when he left that room, he was designated as the Starborn Legion's next Commander, and from there, he has only risen.\n\nNow, as Lord Commander, he has an interesting relationship with the rest of the Council. He is not a charismatic creature, and prefers to speak in data points rather than flamboyant speeches. In general, they view him as one of Chiropterra's best defenders, but should be left out of the picture if anyone is ever needed to make an impassioned speech or an inspired prayer.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"

The stirling reputation of her father and her family's renowned legacy of devotion to the Nightmare has made her the clear successor to the Lord Commander.\n\nThe ponies closest to Autumn understand that her appearance can be deceiving. Cold, calculating, and more than willing to get her hooves dirty; it is no secret her dissatisfaction with the status quo. Vigorious debates between herself and Commander Lucent Eclipse on how to steer the direction of reforms coming to Chiropterra are often the stuff of legendary gossip.\n\nPast the rumors, deception, and appearance she paints around herself, Lady Leaf considers herself a patriot. There is not a treacherous bone in her body, nor any room for mercy to the Nightmare's enemies. In her eyes and in her wisdom, she understands that only the Nightmare is eternal and in order to create eternal loyalty to her Imperial Majesty; there needs to be change. No matter the cost.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"

With the passing of Eternal Eclipse, the young thestral has ascended to a deeply coveted position in Chiropterra and assumed full command of the Ursa Legion. The issues of the nation having weighed heavily on him with each step he has taken in recent years, but now without the guiding wisdom of his grandfather he faces these issues for the first time alone.\n\n These Days the Council meetings are temporarily dominated by clashes between impromptu cliques with Commanders Charm and Palisade supporting his liberal reforms and the conservatives seeking a return to the old ways under Commanders Hail, Emerald, and Lady Auburn Leaf. The two sides debating on whose ideals should guide the nation through its current crisis as Warmaster. Change is coming and he stands at the vanguard of it, though which way the Council will sway is not secured yet. Some consider his social and military reforms too extreme, while others view them as a necessary step in building a strong and stable Chiropterra for the Nightmare to return to.\n\nHis nights are still consumed with paperwork and discussions with Auburn Leaf, the pair at each others throats more and more, but Lucent does not deny how she drives him to work harder, to go further. In those quiet hours, Auburn has admitted the same to him. While their ideologies and the approach to their reforms cannot be more different, their push for change has forced Chiropterra to debate a serious question? What kind of nation will Chiropterra become for itself and what sort of rule it must become for the Nightmare.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"

The young officer flew through the ranks of the Legions not because of his grandfather, Eternal Eclipse, but rather by his own drive and merit. Ponies unfamiliar with Lucent are quick to write him off as an extremist, a young stallion so caught up in his own ideals he cannot see the bigger picture...but they are wrong.\n\nGeneral Eclipse is no fool and while he may not have the stomach for politics, he has a mind for war. As his father has placed more and more responsibility in the leading of the Ursa Legion to him, Lucent has thrown himself into modernizing its doctrine and command. Either through experimental armor units or the radical ideas of allowing Auxiliaries greater responsibilities, his goal in creating the most lethal fighting force Chiropterra has ever seen has earned him the begrudging respect of his peers.\n\nLucent has heart in Chiropterra and that is a hard thing to have. His love for the Nightmare is so great that he knows he must correct her most devout followers from blind zealotry that would harm the Empress' grand vision. There needs to be reform in the nation, there needs to be change. He has often found a kindred spirit in Lady Auburn Leaf of Clan Reed, leading to many late night debates and harsh discussions in dimly lit parlors. While they might not agree on each issue, they certainly understand that the future is in their hooves.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"

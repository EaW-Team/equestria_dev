### FOCUS LOCALISATION ####################
###########################################
FBK_start_modernise:0 "Begin Development"
FBK_start_modernise_desc:0 "Our way of life has served us well so far, but the world is changing. We hear stories of distant lands and the great machines that they possess. We must start bringing our country up to date if we wish not to be left behind."
FBK_tractors:0 "Agricultural Tools"
FBK_tractors_desc:0 "Our Farmers still till their fields with ox-drawn ploughs. Importing newfangled mechanical tools from Griffonia would significantly improve the lives of our people."
FBK_new_crops:0 "Higher-Yield Crops"
FBK_new_crops_desc:0 "We see that the Griffins have increased their food production massively by adopting newer crops, that produce more and better fruit. We should copy their example, to ensure our people never go hungry."
FBK_stone_roads:0 "From Dirt Paths to Stone Roads"
FBK_stone_roads_desc:0 "Most of our country is still connected by little more than dirt paths, beaten down by the hooves of generations of ponies. A series of stone roads will greatly improve the ease of both travel and trade within our nation."
FBK_metals:0 "Dig For Heavy Metals"
FBK_metals_desc:0 "The hills of Farbrook are rich in minerals, but until now we have been able to make only limited use of these. We should establish proper mines to increase our access to these precious natural resources."
FBK_urban1:0 "Promote Urbanisation"
FBK_urban1_desc:0 "As our population increases, more and more ponies are finding that there are simply no jobs for them to do in the countryside. By encouraging these surplus ponies to move to our towns, we can build up our urban centres into bustling metropoles - at least, what passes for a metropolis out in East Griffonia."
FBK_start_trade:0 "Expand Foreign Trade"
FBK_start_trade_desc:0 "Our nation is relatively remote and isolated, and we've never made much of an effort to encourage people to come here. With our new infrastructure it should be easier to convince merchants to travel through our lands, making our country a hub for lucrative trade."
FBK_steam_engine:0 "The Steam Engine"
FBK_steam_engine_desc:0 "We have heard of the wonders of steam from the Griffons, but only now are we realising the full implications of this device. After our new developments, our country is finally ready for the mass adoption of steam power."
FBK_schools_1:0 "Encourage Education"
FBK_schools_1_desc:0 "With our newfound prosperity, it is becoming increasingly obvious that skilled ponies are needed to work the machines of the modern day. We should establish a rudimentary school system to help produce the kind of specialists we need."
FBK_urban2:0 "New Settlements and Towns"
FBK_urban2_desc:0 "Our towns and cities are no longer able to contain our burgeoning population. We must found new towns to give everyone a place to live - which, coincidentally, will further expand business and industry within our country."
FBK_rail:0 "The Iron Pony"
FBK_rail_desc:0 "With the advent of steam, a new way of travel reveals itself to Farbrook - the railway! Capable of speed and stamina that nopony can match, this invention will bring our country even closer together."
FBK_uni:0 "The First Universities"
FBK_uni_desc:0 "Our initial attempts at providing education have proven successful, but we still lack institutes of higher learning. We now have the population to support full-time universities, and they've begin popping up to serve the needs of our ponies."
FBK_entrep:0 "Entrepreneurs and Big Business"
FBK_entrep_desc:0 "With our growing industrialisation, a new class of rich businessponies has come into being. These ponies provide funds out of their own pockets to build privately-held factories, and go abroad to learn business methods from colleges in Griffenheim. The rise of this new class has greatly increased our knowledge of industry."
FBK_industrial_revolution:0 "Industrial Revolution"
FBK_industrial_revolution_desc:0 "Our country has come a long way, and now, with the widespread use of internal combustion, it is about to take another leap into the future."
FBK_council:0 "The Council Deliberates"
FBK_council_desc:0 "Every seven years, the Chieftains of the tribes of Farbrook come together to discuss their plans for the future, as well as who will head the Council until next time. Cenhelm has led us well these last years, but some wonder if he is too soft to save us in the dark times that look to be brewing ahead."
FBK_harmony:0 "Cenhelm was re-elected"
FBK_nonaligned:0 "The Council abolished the role of Chief Speaker"
FBK_fascist:0 "Gering was chosen to lead"
FBK_communist:0 "Communists have taken control of the Council"
FBK_extremist:0 "The Council has lost faith in Cenhelm"
FBK_cenhelm:0 "Stick With What We Know"
FBK_cenhelm_desc:0 "Cenhelm has already proven himself a wise leader - why would we change what's working just fine?"
FBK_friend_north:0 "Friends In The North"
FBK_friend_north_desc:0 "We have always maintained good relations with the neighbouring tribesponies, but until now we have never formalised our friendship. Establishing proper diplomatic relations will pave the wave for closer ties in future."
FBK_friend_RIV:0 "Embassy In River City"
FBK_friend_RIV_desc:0 "The River Federation is FBK larger and more developed than we are. They have wondrous machines that save them so much labor! We'd be fools not to push for closer relations with them - at th every least, we might be able to sponge some of their wealth..."
FBK_trade_WAT:0 "Sacred Water Trade"
FBK_trade_WAT_desc:0 "The Springs of Watertown are sacred, and many of our ponies go to Watertown on pilgrimage. However, they refuse to let the water leave their lands. We should pressure them to open up trade for this water, so that we can bring some of it back home. It'll do more good when everyone has access to it, right?"
FBK_trade_FIR:0 "Firtree Lumber Trade"
FBK_trade_FIR_desc:0 "Firtree, as its name suggests, has the best supplies of yula trees in the whole of Griffonia. These trees produce excellent wood, firm, strong, and light, ideal as building material. However, tribesponies are not exactly known for their business acumen, and this vast resource is going largely untapped. We should take it off of their hands."
FBK_trade_NCH:0 "Changeling Labor Force"
FBK_trade_NCH_desc:0 "Now that we have opened our borders to our friends from Glenclyf, they have proven their loyalty and industriousness. We should start employing them on a much larger scale, as they will work longer and for less pay than most hillponies."
FBK_arteries_of_wealth:0 "Arteries of Wealth"
FBK_arteries_of_wealth_desc:0 "The arteries of any wealthy nation are its roads and canals. Now we have actual stone roads, but this is not enough to become a major trading power. We must further expand and develop our roads, as well as establishing a system of road-guards to ensure the paths remain free from bandits and other dangers."
FBK_fishing_tradition:0 "Great Fishing Tradition"
FBK_fishing_tradition_desc:0 "Farbrook, being a coastal nation, has always had fisherponies. Many of our greatest legends involve the sea, and it makes up a substantial portion of our economy. We should harness the great wealth of knowledge they've built up over the years."
FBK_purchase_textbooks:0 "Purchase Textbooks"
FBK_purchase_textbooks_desc:0 "Our populace is woefully undereducated. We have begun to set up a school system, but it is very difficult to find good textbooks for our fledgling schools. We should ask the Federation for help - maybe we can buy some of theirs?"
FBK_federal_grant:0 "Federal Development Grant"
FBK_federal_grant_desc:0 "With our growing ties to the River Federation, they have graciously invested in our nation, building factories, housing, and power plants. Man, this co-operation stuff sure seems to work!"
FBK_nimbusian_officers:0 "Nimbusian Officer Corps"
FBK_nimbusian_officers_desc:0 "Nimbusia, one of the states of the River Federation, is home to a whole caste of skilled tacticians and officers. The pegasi there pride themselves on their skill in battle and strategic planning. We should invite some of them to train our officers, which would surely hasten our attempts to reform our primitive army."
FBK_river_trade:0 "Open River Trade"
FBK_river_trade_desc:0 "The River Federation is a huge country with millions of ponies in it. At present we have a hard time trading with them over land as Firtree and the Knightly Orders lie between us and them. However, if we expanded our trading fleet, we could sail our ships straight up their great rivers and into their massive cities. Profit for all!"
FBK_deepwater_harbor:0 "Build A Deep Water Harbor"
FBK_deepwater_harbor_desc:0 "While we do have a tradition of fishing in Farbrook, we do not have a port capable of mooring the kind of huge and heavy ships needed for large scale oceangoing trade. We should construct our first ever deep-water harbor in Farbrook Cove, taking advantage of its naturally-sheltered position to house massive ships of trade and of war."
FBK_jewel_of_the_north:0 "Jewel Of The North"
FBK_jewel_of_the_north_desc:0 "After considerable investment, Farbrook is beginning to rise from obscurity. No longer are we a nation of half-savages, prancing in the woods and eating bark - now we are a small but proud trading country, with large harbors and excellent roads. Farbrook is gaining a reputation for itself as the biggest city in the region - the Jewel of the North."
FBK_bitbridle:0 "Bitbridle Rifle Co."
FBK_bitbridle_desc:0 "Farbrook's newfound prosperity has allowed some young, inventive ponies to come up with new ideas. One of these is a young stallion by the name of Bitbridle, who has invented a brand-new rifle design that is cheaper and easier to maintain than the standard-issue. If we employ him to work for us, it will give us a substantial leg up on rifle production."
FBK_cenhelm_academy:0 "Grand Cenhelm Academy"
FBK_cenhelm_academy_desc:0 "With the growth of our nation has come the consequent growth of our intelligentsia. Our initial universities are no longer able to keep up with the demand for higher education. We will establish the Grand Cenhelm University in Farbrook, to act as a centre of learning that will be renowned the world over."
FBK_drill_for_oil:0 "Drill For Oil"
FBK_drill_for_oil_desc:0 "With our newfound technology, we now finally have the capability to drill deep into the rock just offshore of Farbrook Harbor, and we have made an incredible discovery! Farbrook lies directly on top of a massive deposit of oil, just waiting to be tapped! Drilling into this resource will be a massive boon for our nation."
FBK_Farbrook_cement:0 "Farbrook Lime Cement"
FBK_Farbrook_cement_desc:0 "An enterprising young businesscolt has discovered that lime from Farbrook's cliffs, if mixed in correctly, can increase the durability of cement by as much as 30%. This remarkable discovery will dramatically improve the quality of our buildings and construction work - and who knows, maybe we could make a fortune selling this in River City?"
FBK_republican_guard:0 "Establish the Republican Guard"
FBK_republican_guard_desc:0 "Our nation has never had a formal army, relying instead on the personal armies of the leading chief, or whatever could be mustered from a small cluster of chiefs. Now that we are more developed, we must establish a proper Guard to safeguard our prosperity."
FBK_federal_statehood:0 "Apply For Statehood"
FBK_federal_statehood_desc:0 "The Federation has invested a substantial amount of money and labor to make us the country that we are today, and many River Ponies have come to settle in our country. Pressure has been mounting from Federal officials and internal citizens alike, asking us to formally join the Federation. After much deliberation, we have sent an application to become the Federal State of Farbrook."
FBK_seperate_but_equal:0 "Seperate But Equal"
FBK_seperate_but_equal_desc:0 "While the Federation has given us much, we are hillponies first and foremost. We should maintain good relations with the River Federation, but at the same time assert our independence from them."
FBK_federal_schools:0 "Federation-Standard Schools"
FBK_federal_schoolsD_desc:0 "Now that we are a full member of the Federation, we should reform our school system in line with Federal guidelines. This will of course mean teaching primarily in the Riverpony dialect, which might annoy some traditionalists, but they'll come around."
FBK_political_participation:0 "Increased Political Participation"
FBK_political_participation_desc:0 "Nowadays, our young people are FBK better-informed and politically aware than their parents or grandparents. This new wave of political consciousness has resulted in massively-increased participation in our political system, greatly strengthening our government."
FBK_free_education:0 "Free Education"
FBK_free_education_desc:0 "Our new wealth has produced great things for our country, but it has changed much too. An uneducated worker can no longer get anything resembling a decent job. Our school system helps, but many of the poorest ponies cannot afford to go to school, espeically in the rural regions. We will establish free primary education for all, to benefit everybody."
FBK_open_borders:0 "Open Borders"
FBK_open_borders_desc:0 "Now that we are a Federal State, we are obliged to implement freedom of travel between Farbrook and other Federation Members. Ponies and Griffons have been emigrating here in small numbers ever since we began our economic rise, but with the passing of these laws, the floodgates will be opened and our population should skyrocket."
FBK_northern_capital:0 "Capital Of The North"
FBK_northern_capital_desc:0 "Farbrook has earned a reputation as the greatest city in the North, and we will keep it that way. By redoubling our investment in industry, we will ensure that we deserve the title 'Capital of the North'."
FBK_home_of_the_hill_warrior:0 "Home Of The Hill Warrior"
FBK_home_of_the_hill_warrior_desc:0 "The ponies of Farbrook have always been known for their expertise in hilly and mountainous terrain. Even though we are now a more civilised nation, we keep this legacy alive. We will make these skilled warriors a key part of our contribution to the Federal military, which should strengthen the Federation as a whole."
FBK_new_generation:0 "A New Generation of Leaders"
FBK_new_generation_desc:0 "At last, our education investment have borne fruit. The newest generation of ponies possesses levels of political engagement and civic pride unheard of in our history, and greater even than that of the ancient Republics of western Griffonia. This will truly be a generation of great leaders, and we are sure they will accomplish great things."
FBK_expand_republican_guard:0 "Expand The Republican Guard"
FBK_expand_republican_guard_desc:0 "The Republican Guard is not large enough to ensure our safety against the rising threats of this world. Without the Federation to protect us, we must expand the Guard so that we are ready to deal with anything that comes our way - be it from North, South, or West."
FBK_federation_day:0 "Federation Day"
FBK_federation_day_desc:0 "Now that we are a true Federal State, we should establish this day as a proper holiday, to celebrate. Students will be given the day off, and parades will be organised to commemmorate the Federation that has brought us such happiness and comfort."
FBK_constitution:0 "Write A Constitution"
FBK_constitution_desc:0 "Our great nation does not as of yet have a true Constitution, setting out precisely what the fundamental rights, liberties, and responsibilities of each citizen are. We must write this great document so that the hillponies will have their rights protected from grasping and unjust businessmen and politicians."
FBK_star_of_the_north:0 "Star of the North"
FBK_star_of_the_north_desc:0 "As we look back on how FBK we've come, we realise that Farbrook is now a truly great nation. With heads held high, we march onwards bravely into the future. The Star of the North shines ever brightly! Farbrook forever!"
FBK_council_coup:0 "Council Consolidates Power"
FBK_council_coup_desc:0 "Why should any one Chief have pre-eminence among the many, diverse peoples of our nation? If we are to face the dark times ahead, we must face them together as equals."
FBK_gering:0 "Glory To Farbrook"
FBK_gering_desc:0 "Hermane Gering has earned the Council's approval to lead Farbrook for the next seven years. He will lead it to glory, or die trying."
FBK_thenorth:0 "Shelter From The Black Crusade"
FBK_thenorth_desc:0 "Disaster! Our longstanding guardians, the Arcturian Order, have fallen to the Dread Leaugue! We must scramble to defend ourselves - this could be the end of the world!"
FBK_extremism:0 "Radical Leadership"
FBK_extremism_desc:0 "The Council has lost faith in Cenhelm's ability to lead us. The lot now falls between two ponies. Applethorn is Chief of the Tanglebriar Tribe, and absorbed strange ideas during his youth spent in Prywhen. On the other hoof, Hermane Gering, the stern warrior chief of the White Hooves clan, with his dreams of Empire."
FBK_comm:0 "Communists Take Control of the Council"
FBK_comm_desc:0 "The Council has chosen to let the Stallionists rule Farbrook for the next few years. Their first action was to dissolve the council and declare Farbrook a sovereign People's Republic, by the workingpony, and for the workingpony."
FBK_suppression:0 "Quell Dissent"
FBK_suppression_desc:0 "There are those who think that our new form of government is unjust and untraditional. In the interests of maintaining peace and stability, we must show these neigh-sayers what's what."
FBK_imperialism:0 "Imperialist Dreams"
FBK_imperialism_desc:0 "Who says that Farbrook is a backwater? Fools! The greatness of a nation is measured by the strength of its spirit, and in time, its borders will inevitably change to reflect that spirit. We are Hill Ponies! We are strong!"
FBK_military_education:0 "A Military Education"
FBK_military_education_desc:0 "A great kingdom is built on the back of victory in battle, and victory in battle is built on the back of skilled leadership. We must provide formal education for our officer corps if we are to have any realistic hope of glory."
FBK_warrior_tithe:0 "The Warrior Tithe"
FBK_warrior_tithe_desc:0 "Up until now, we have had a very haphazard military, mostly thrown together from the warriors that individuals tribes could spare. This will not do for our glorious new state! We must institute the Warrior's Tithe - each tribe must send a certain percentage of their young stallions to serve in the armed forces or face severe punishment."
FBK_armories:0 "Establish Armories"
FBK_armories_desc:0 "Our industrial weapons production lags woefully behind the times. We must have proper military industry if we are to attain the greatness that is our destiny."
FBK_schooling_for_service:0 "Schooling For Service"
FBK_schooling_for_service_desc:0 "Our officer schools have been a smashing success, however it is difficult for an educated officer to get the best out of illiterate soldiers. We should establish military academies to provide education to our soldiers in the field."
FBK_griffon_tactics:0 "Griffon-Style Tactics"
FBK_griffon_tactics_desc:0 "While our past relations with them are rocky at best, we must admit that the Griffins' military tactics are superior to our own. We should study them in order to improve the performance of our armies on the battlefield."
FBK_four_hooves:0 "Our Own Four Hooves"
FBK_four_hooves_desc:0 "We need no allies! Farbrook shall stand tall and proud, the greatest of all pony nations!"
FBK_beseech_the_emperor:0 "Beseech The Emperor"
FBK_beseech_the_emperor_desc:0 "The wretched River Federation stands in the way of our ambitions. Despite our rocky history with them, the Griffonian Empire is a strong and rising power that we could use as a means to an end. We shall send a proposition to Griffenheim, offering our loyalty in exchange for aid. The fools..."
FBK_two_pronged_attack:0 "Two-Pronged Attack"
FBK_two_pronged_attack_desc:0 "We cannot achieve our national glory with the River Federation standing in our way. They are strong, probably too strong for us to fight alone. But they have many enemies. Perhaps we could convince those enemies to team up with us to partition the Federation's land between us?"
FBK_stormtroopers:0 "Stormtroopers"
FBK_stormtroopers_desc:0 "It is obvious that we can rely on ourselves, and only on ourselves. Only by embracing fully our glorious history of mountain warFBKe can we truly find greatness."
FBK_axis:0 "Axis Of Honor"
FBK_axis_desc:0 "Griffenheim has commanded the Griffin Knights to aid us militarily. It is time that we formalised this arrangement into a true military alliance."
FBK_coop:0 "Military Missions"
FBK_coop_desc:0 "Our newfound allies will not be of much use if their troops are of poor quality. We should send our officers to them, so that they can take advantage of our superior military genius."
FBK_coldmouth:0 "The Coldmouth Corridor"
FBK_coldmouth_desc:0 "It is undeniable that all hillponies should be under one nation - but there are hill ponies living in Coldmouth, under Firtree! This is an outrage - we must be prepared to use every measure up to and including war to right this wrong."

FBK_fate_of_villages_desc:0 "All the Northern Ponies must be united under one banner - and that banner will be ours."
FBK_war_RIV:0 "War with the Riverfolk"
FBK_war_RIV_desc:0 "Our moment has finally come. So FBK the river ponies have been too cowardly to oppose our conquests, despite being in a position to do so, but there can be no more waiting. We will strike down the River Federation or we will die trying!"
FBK_final_struggle:0 "The Final Struggle"
FBK_final_struggle_desc:0 "Our hour of destiny is at hand! Every soldier must be ready to give his life for the nation! A moment such as this shall never come again, and what is a life compared to the glory that awaits us?"
FBK_hillponies:0 "Hillponies United Under One Banner"
FBK_hillponies_desc:0 "Now that the lands of the northern Hill Ponies have finally been united under one banner, it is time to properly integrate them into our country - whether they like it or not."
FBK_hillpony_dominance:0 "Hillpony Dominance"
FBK_hillpony_dominance_desc:0 "The hillponies fought and died for our victory, and it is the hillponies that will rule it! All the other races that made up the former Federation are second-class citizens at best."
FBK_reconciliation:0 "Reconciliation Efforts"
FBK_reconciliation_desc:0 "Despite our longtime hatred for the Federation and all that it stood for, we must admit it had some good ideas. In particular, its ability to keep many races in (relative) harmony was impressive. We should use a light touch with our defeated enemies, so that they may come to accept us an rightful rulers."
FBK_lord_of_hill_and_dell:0 "Lord of Hill and Dell"
FBK_lord_of_hill_and_dell_desc:0 "At last, Gering's dream has been accomplished. He stands, undisputed master of the ponies of East Griffonia, and has been formally crowned Emperor in a ceremony at River City. His ambition has not been sated, however, and he still has plans - but the Griffin Empire may be unhappy if we made promises of fealty..."
FBK_honor_oath:0 "Honor Our Oath"
FBK_honor_oath_desc:0 "We achieved this victory through the aid of our stalwart allies, the Griffin Empire, and promised them fealty. Now that we have achieved victory, we shall appeal for formal membership of the Empire. Farbrook will become the greatest Grand Duchy of the Empire, and Gering its greatest Arch-Duke."
FBK_politburo:0 "First Worker's Constitutional Congress"
FBK_politburo_desc:0 "The Revolution has been successful! Now that the reactionaries have been suppressed, it falls to us to safeguard the Socialist State by electing a leader to guide us. We have a choice between Applethorn, the well-travelled mare of the world, and Moonblossom, a former community leader of Watertown."
FBK_vanguard:0 "Applethorn's Revolutionary Vanguard Party"
FBK_vanguard_desc:0 "Comrade Applethorn spent her youth adventuring in the south, and spent years working for the Prywhen People's Liberation Army. She sees th backwardness of Farbrook as an obstacle, and wishes to rapidly industrialise and army the nation to advance the cause of the workers of the world."
FBK_7yrplan:0 "Seven-Year Plan"
FBK_7yrplan_desc:0 "Farbrook is woefully behind the times, even by the standards of relatively-backwards Griffonia. If our Revolution is to survive, it is absolutely imperative that we industralise and bring ourselves into the modern world - no matter the cost or the strain."
FBK_soc_ed:0 "Socialist Education"
FBK_soc_ed_desc:0 "Our populace is woefully uneducated, and will never develop proper class consciousness in this condition. We must spare no effort to make sure that each and every pony receives a proper education along Communistic and revolutionary lines."
FBK_red_army:0 "A Red Army"
FBK_red_army_desc:0 "The Revolution cannot be safeguarded by mere words and wishes alone. We must have a proper army of loyal working ponies if we are to have any hope of success."
FBK_new_manifesto:0 "Compose The New Manifesto"
FBK_new_manifesto_desc:0 "Our socialist state is still very young. In the interests of stability, we should write and publish a manifesto, to be made available free to all ponies, explaining the purpose, beliefs, powers, restrictions, and functionings of the new government."
FBK_agrarian:0 "Moonblossom's Socialist Agrarian Workers Party"
FBK_agrarian_desc:0 "Moonblossom used to be a community leader in nearby Watertown before she was expelled on trumped-up grounds. She believes that it is more important to make the lives of the workers of Farbrook fairer and more equitable. She advocates for peace, happiness, and a retreat from the industrial world."
FBK_tribal:0 "First Principle: Harmony With The Land"
FBK_tribal_desc:0 "Moonblossom recognises that much of the evil in the world comes from our inability to live in a correct relationship with nature. To this end, we must abolish the false distinctions we make between ourselves and the creatures of the earth - such things as stone buildings, plows, and industrial machines must all go!"
FBK_peace:0 "Second Principle: Harmony With The World"
FBK_peace_desc:0 "The second principle of Moonblossom's Manifesto is that of peace between the ponies of the world. After all, what is to be gained by war? We would be much better off without weapons and soldiers."
FBK_egalitarianism:0 "Third Principle: Harmony With Each Other"
FBK_egalitarianism_desc:0 "The Final Principle of Moonblossom is the abolition of distinctions between each other. Mother, father, mare, stallion, pony, and griffon - all of these are meaningless. These bonds are really chains, chains that must be broken if we are to be truly free."
FBK_famine:0 "Disastrous Famine"
FBK_famine_desc:0 "Disaster! Moonblossom's forced primitivisation of Farbrook has left it with more ponies than its new lack of infrastructure can support. There is not enough food to feed everyone, and something must be done before thousands starve to death!"
FBK_collapse:0 "Social Collapse"
FBK_collapse_desc:0 "The first thing that the furious ponies of Farbrook did was to ask Moonblossom to help them. She only responded by saying that this was an unfortunate but necessary step in the perfecting of the Communist society. Needless to say, they weren't happy with that..."
FBK_NCH_absorb:0 "Beg Glenclyf"
FBK_NCH_absorb_desc:0 "We are out of food, out of leaders, and out of options. We do not have the strength to rebuild ourselves, not in time to prevent thousands of deaths. We must beg our ancient friends, the Changelings of Glenclyf for help. We will ask them to rule us instead - at least they have food."
FBK_RIV_absorb:0 "Beg The Riverfolk"
FBK_RIV_absorb_desc:0 "We never thought it would come to this, but we have no options left. The River Federation has food - let us ask them for help, in exchange for our sovereignty. We obviously aren't capable of ruling ourselves..."
FBK_new_soviet_pony:0 "New Soviet Pony"
FBK_new_soviet_pony_desc:0 "It is obvious that our nature, warped by capitalism, has rendered us incapable of living as TRUE Communists. We must create a newer, braver, more selfless pony if the Revolution is to succeed in the long term."
FBK_rural_electrification:0 "Rural Electrification"
FBK_rural_electrification_desc:0 "Our construction efforts have so FBK been primarily focussed on the more densely-populated areas of our country. While this is fine, the people of the countryside are an important part of our nation also. We must ensure they also see the benefits of Soviet government."
FBK_comm_arsenal:0 "Armories of the Revolution"
FBK_comm_arsenal_desc:0 "What use is it to have revolutionary zeal if we have no weapons with which to fight? We must develop our military industry to safeguard our country."

FBK_comm_watertown:0 "Draw Close To Watertown"
FBK_comm_watertown_desc:0 "Watertown is already practising a form of Communism, and it would be a terrible shame if fellow Communists were to remain disunited. We should make a special effort to draw close to our comrades near the ancient Springs."
FBK_crush_sunstriker:0 "Crush The Sunstriker Clan"
FBK_crush_sunstriker_desc:0 "Watertown has heard our proposal with interest, but they are not entirely convinced that they should join with us. They have set us a task - if we can permanently end the threat of raids from the Sunstriker Bandits who terrorise them, they will join us."
FBK_comm_firtree:0 "Draw Close To Firtree"
FBK_comm_firtree_desc:0 "Firtree is our closest neighbour, and provides access to the more southernly realms of the Continent. We should make diplomatic efforts to draw closer to them, to ensure the safety and effective propagation of revolutionary ideals."
FBK_crush_knights:0 "Crush Hellquill"
FBK_crush_knights_desc:0 "Firtree has set us a task in order to prove the worth of their allying with us - to save them from the Knights of Hellquill. The Griffon Knights have constantly raided and oppressed not only the ponies of the East, but also their own working people. These fedual anachronisms must be crushed and discarded as the instruments of oppression that they are."
FBK_NESU:0 "North Eastern Socialist Union"
FBK_NESU_desc:0 "At last, comrades, we are ready! All nearby threats have been quelled, and the ponies of the North East have been brought to our side. We are now ready to establish a great Soviet Union, a Communistic alliance that will spread socialism all over the North and East!"
FBK_strike_empire:0 "Strike The Empire"
FBK_strike_empire_desc:0 "Now that we have established the N.E.S.U, we must turn our attention to even greater tasks. The continent of Griffonia is full of archaic despotisms, and the heartland of all these is the Griffonian Empire. Destroying the Empire would prove once and for all the inevitability of the Communist Victory."
FBK_workers_paradise:0 "Worker's Paradise"
FBK_workers_paradise_desc:0 "Now that the Revolution in the North East is secure, we should turn our attention inwards. By creating the greatest socialist state in the world, we will act as a shining beacon to all the oppressed workers of the world!"
FBK_buy_guns:0 "Buy Guns From The River Federation"
FBK_buy_guns_desc:0 "Our armies are woefully behind the times. We have heard tell of 'gunpowder', and the way it has revolutionised warFBKe among the riverponies - we should send a delegation to them to see if we can acquire some of these 'firearms' for ourselves."
FBK_rein_in_chiefs:0 "Rein In The Chieftains"
FBK_rein_in_chiefs_desc:0 "Our "army" is nothing more than a motley collection of tribal warriors loaned by the various tribal leaders. This causes significant organisational problems. If we are to have any chance of surviving in this changing world, we need to reduce the power of the chiefs."
FBK_encourage_weaponsmiths:0 "Encourage Weaponsmiths"
FBK_encourage_weaponsmiths_desc:0 "Currently all of our weapons are made by hoof, keeping our output low. These smiths have wildly varying levels of skill and experience, and there are not enough of them to support our burgeoning army. We must encourage more ponies to go into the weaponmaking trade if we are to be able to protect the future of Farbrook."
FBK_logistics:0 "Battlefield Specialists"
FBK_logistics_desc:0 "As long as there has been war, there have been those who wait upon the warriors - cupbearers, field surgeons, mere laborers and load bearers. However, some of the devices we have seen in the armies of the River ponies are astounding to us. We must acquire some of these 'support tools', to keep our ponies fighting longer and more effectively."
FBK_post_tribal_army:0 "Post-Tribal Army"
FBK_post_tribal_army_desc:0 "Our armed forces are ill-disciplined and badly organised, often with conflicting loyalties. We must reform the army and introduce an explicit chain of command, as well as the beginnings of an officer corps."
FBK_basic_planning:0 "Rudimentary Planning"
FBK_basic_planning_desc:0 "Up until now, our military strategy has consisted of little more than charging at the enemy, or finding slightly different ways to do so. This will no longer suffice - we should study the tactics used by the River Federation, to help us form useful battle plans, suitable for the modern war."
FBK_basic_firepower:0 "Fundamentals of Firepower"
FBK_basic_firepower_desc:0 "The guns that we have bought from the Riverponies have shown us a new way of war - a manner vastly superior to our old ways. However, we are not yet familiar with the best ways to use these weapons. We must invest more time to studying the usage of these new firearms."
FBK_basic_mass:0 "The New Horde"
FBK_basic_mass_desc:0 "In ancient days, the warriors of the hills were infamous for their hordes - groups of warriors that would raid nearby towns and caravans, attacking in swarms that overwhelmed their enemies. While crude, these tactics were effective, and they will serve as a useful foundation for our strategies in the future."
FBK_engineers:0 "The Importance of Engineering"
FBK_engineers_desc:0 "One surprising development that we have learned from our study of strategy is the importance of engineers - those ponies who dig and fortify trenches. We should invest in the technology necessary to field these forces, for all our texts report that a good engineering corps is vital to success in war."
FBK_bigger_guns:0 "Buy Bigger Guns"
FBK_bigger_guns_desc:0 "The success of the firearms we have already gotten our hooves on has convinced us that this is the key to victory in future. If guns equal victory, then surely bigger guns equals MORE victory!"
FBK_peasants_in_the_army:0 "Peasants In The Army"
FBK_peasants_in_the_army_desc:0 "Up until now, only the higher classes could serve as true warriors, the peasants being forced to fight only in desperate times. This must change - we will provide for proper training for peasants who prove themselves, and open the army to them in order to increase the size of our army."
FBK_industrial_military:0 "Industrialised Military"
FBK_industrial_military_desc:0 "Now that our society has developed and our army is better trained, we can go about crushing the last vestiges of tribal hierarchy within our armed forces, making them a more effective fighting force."
FBK_gbp_2:0 "Improved Doctrines"
FBK_gbp_2_desc:0 "Our initial attempts to expand our battle planning proved highly effective. Now that our army has become more industrialised, we must evolve our army doctrines again to follow suit."
FBK_sfp_2:0 "Volley Fire Training"
FBK_sfp_2_desc:0 "With the increased industrialisation of our armed forces comes the need for improved firepower. We will implement new training regimes to ensure that our army keeps pace with its contemporaries."
FBK_mass_2:0 "Great Patriotic Army"
FBK_mass_2_desc:0 "With our army being larger and more prestigious than ever, many new stallions desire to join. We must develop our tactics such that they are suitable for armies of massive size."
FBK_modern_military:0 "A Modern Military"
FBK_modern_military_desc:0 "At long last, we have finished our army reforms. Our army is now comparable to those of the most advanced nations in terms of army tactics and equipment. With this, our safety should be secure."
FBK_navy:0 "Establish a Navy"
FBK_navy_desc:0 "Though we have a longstanding tradition of fishing, we hardly have anything that could be called a Navy. Now that we have come out of the darkness of savagery, we should found a port so that we can properly construct a fleet."
FBK_fleet_in_being:0 "Adopt Fleet-In-Being Doctrine"
FBK_fleet_in_being_desc:0 "Now that we are in the process of establishing a navy, we must decide upon a naval strategy. Some officers recommend following a doctrine they heard about in Bakara, focussing on maintaining large standing navies."
FBK_trade_interdiction:0 "Adopt Trade Interdiction Doctrine"
FBK_trade_interdiction_desc:0 "Now that we are in the process of establishing a navy, we must decide upon a naval strategy. Some officers recommmend a doctrine they learned of in the naval academy in Bakara, focussing on the attacking of an enemy's trade vessels."
FBK_cruisers:0 "Study Cruisers"
FBK_cruisers_desc:0 "Now that we have decided upon what doctrine to follow, we should set about learning how to build the necessary ships to carry out that doctrine."
FBK_submarines:0 "Study Submarines"
FBK_submarines_desc:0 "Now that we have decided upon what doctrine to follow, we should set about learning how to build the necessary ships to carry out that doctrine. Now, if only we can find out how these mysterious "sub-marine ships" actually work, we should be able to start."
FBK_airforce:0 "The Flying Hillponies"
FBK_airforce_desc:0 "For thousands of years, it has been the fate of hillponies to look on in envy as Pegasi soared through the air. Now, we have caught wind of a new technology that will allow us to finally surpass the limitations placed on us by nature."
FBK_fighters:0 "Buy Fighter Planes"
FBK_fighters_desc:0 "We don't have much experience in this field, so we must look outwards for help. We have heard that 'fighter planes' are the keys to ensuring control of the skies, so we will focus on importing those first."
FBK_bombers:0 "Buy Bombers"
FBK_bombers_desc:0 "We don't have much experience in this field, so we must look outwards for help. We have heard that 'bombers' are key to modern warFBKe, for they can drop large loads of munitions on the enemy without giving them the chance to fight back. Surely we should focus on importing these first?"
FBK_air_strat:0 "Develop Aerial Tactics"
FBK_air_strat_desc:0 "Now that we have some aeroplanes, we are starting to get used to the idea of air combat. Some of our most skilled pilots are starting to get ideas about how best to employ our new planes. Since we don't really know any better ourselves, it's probably a good idea to listen to them."

### EVENTS #################################
###########################################
FBK.1.t:0 "The Council's Decision"
FBK.1.d:0 "After months of deliberation, the Council has finally made up their mind who should lead the Farbrook tribes in this difficult time. Their choice was..."
FBK.1.a:0 "We need stable leadership - no changes"
FBK.1.b:0 "A firm hoof is necessary - Cenhelm must go"
FBK.2.t:0 "Power Struggles within the Council"
FBK.2.d:0 "The Council has rejected the experienced leadership of Cenhelm - but who will they choose to replace him?"
FBK.2.a:0 "The Communists have some interesting ideas - let's invite them into the Council"
FBK.2.b:0 "Chief Gering shows promise - he will lead us through this difficult time"
FBK.3.t:0 "A Proposal From The East"
FBK.3.d:0 "An pony envoy sought an audience with the Regent today, and offered a most interesting proposal. She claimed to come from the FBK east, from a backwards nation called Farbrook. We recognised the name as one of the clans of savages that the Knightly Orders have been charged with guarding our Eastern border from for centuries now. The envoy claimed that Farbrook regrets their history of animosity with us, and claims her leader, Hermane Gering, asks for help. Gering wishes to unite the Ponies of the Eastern Hills and plains, but the River Federation is posing a major obstacle to this, and he asks for our aid in defeating them. In exchange, Gering offers his obedience to the crown, offering the Eastern lands to us if we will but allow him to administrate them."
FBK.3.a:0 "Offer him aid and command the Knightly Orders to fight alongside him. We have much to gain and little to lose"
FBK.3.b:0 "We are not interested in the affairs of savages"
FBK.4.t:0 "Divide and Conquer"
FBK.4.d:0 "A messenger came from the frigid North today. He claimed to speak on behalf of Hermane Gering, Chieftain of the hillponies of Farbrook. Chieftain Gering is offering us a simple deal: agree to go to war with the Federation alongside Gering, and we will be granted a large chunk of the spoils, gaining access to the rich floodplains and FBKmlands of the River Valleys. What will our response be?"
FBK.4.a:0 "The lands are fertile...tell him we accept"
FBK.4.b:0 "This isn't in our best interest"
FBK.5.t:0 "Divide and Conquer"
FBK.5.d:0 "A messenger came from the frigid North today. He claimed to speak on behalf of Hermane Gering, Chieftain of the hillponies of Farbrook. Chieftain Gering is offering us a simple deal: agree to go to war with the Federation alongside Gering, and we will be granted a large chunk of the spoils, gaining access to the rich floodplains and FBKmlands of the River Valleys. What will our response be?"
FBK.5.a:0 "The lands are fertile...tell him we accept"
FBK.5.b:0 "This isn't in our best interest"
FBK.6.t:0 "The Empire is Interested"
FBK.6.d:0 "Our messenger arrived from Griffonheim yesterday, with excellent news - the Empire has accepted our offer. Military advisors, weapons, and personnel will be delivered to us for the war effort, and while the Empire is not willing to commit itself personally to a war in the East, it has ordered the two Griffin Knightly Orders to provide us with direct military assistance in any future wars. Of course, they DO expect our pledge of alleigance in exchange..."
FBK.6.a:0 "Of course, of course, whatever they want"
FBK.7.t:0 "Imperial Scorn"
FBK.7.d:0 "Ill news has returned to us this day: the Empire is not interested in helping us against the Federation. They are unwilling to commit themselves to a war in the East without better hope of a profit for themselves."
FBK.7.a:0 "We will have to look elsewhere"
FBK.8.t:0 "The Gryphian Host signs the River Pact"
FBK.8.d:0 "Excellent news! The Gryphian Host has agreed to our terms, and will attack the Federation alongside us. However, they will demand part of the Federation's land in exchange for this."
FBK.8.a:0 "I can already hear Lake City burning!"
FBK.9.t:0 "The Gryphian Host isn't interested"
FBK.9.d:0 "Sad news came from the South today - the Gryphian Host refused to join our offensive pact to partition the River Federation."
FBK.9.a:0 "Never trust a Griffon!"
FBK.10.t:0 "The Zebras sign the River Pact"
FBK.10.d:0 "An envoy arrived this morning, bring word from the Zebra nation that they have accepted our deal. In return for land, they will help us to defeat the River Ponies."
FBK.10.a:0 "They may look odd, but they will be useful nonetheless"
FBK.11.t:0 "The Zebras turn their noses down at us"
FBK.11.d:0 "Unfortunately, the Zebras have sent a messenger telling us that they have no interest in our pact to partition the River Federation."
FBK.11.a:0 "We should've known they were cowards"
FBK.13.t:0 "The Deer sign the River Pact"
FBK.13.d:0 "We received word from the South today that the Deer are willing and eager to support us in our war with the River Federation."
FBK.13.a:0 "The Federation's days are numbered!"
FBK.14.t:0 "The Deer ignore our proposal"
FBK.14.d:0 "Bad news arrived today - the Deer are not interested in joining with us against the River Ponies."
FBK.14.a:0 "Damn their eyes"
FBK.15.t:0 "Military Mission From Farbrook"
FBK.15.d:0 "In view of our new alliance with Hermane Gering, Farbrook has sent some of its finest military minds on a mission to our nation. This should significantly improve the quality of our officer corps."
FBK.15.a:0 "Maybe those northerners aren't so bad after all"
FBK.16.a:0 "The Coldmouth Corridor"
FBK.16.t:0 "Farbrook Demands Coldmouth Corridor"
FBK.16.d:0 "Hermane Gering's rhetoric has been getting more and more inflammatory as of late. He has been speaking for months about how the land from Coldmouth to the sea is, and always has been, hill pony land, and that all hill ponies should be in one nation. Now, an ultimatum has been delivered to us - cede this territory to Farbrook's regime or face open war."
FBK.16.a:0 "We have no choice. Surrender the land"
FBK.16.b:0 "Over my dead body!"
FBK.17.t:0 "Firtree Folds"
FBK.17.d:0 "Intimidated by our great might, Firtree has willingly ceded the Coldmouth Corridor."
FBK.17.a:0 "As it should be"
FBK.18.t:0 "Firtree Defiant"
FBK.18.d:0 "Foolishly, the ponies of Firtree have refused our generous offer to unite all hillponies under one nation."
FBK.18.a:0 "Do they think the Federation will protect them? Hah!"
FBK.19.t:0 "Famine Strikes!"
FBK.19.d:0 "Unfortunately, Moonblossom's policies of forced technological regression have had entirely predictable effects. Our food production is no longer able to keep up with our population, and food is rapidly running out. Babes are wailing in hunger, mothers have nothing to give them. Riots are breaking out all over the country, and all eyes turn to Moonblossom's tent, seeking a way out of this disaster."
FBK.19.a:0 "If only we had known!"
FBK.20.t:0 "Farbrook Begs For Food"
FBK.20.d:0 "A desperate envoy arrived this morning, famished and gaunt, like a skeleton. He told us that Farbrook's leader, Moonblossom, had enacted policies of agrarianism and primtivism that had resulted in a terrible famine that will surely kill thousands of ponies if nothing is done about it. Farbrook begs us to come in and take care of them - all government has collapsed entirely, rioting is commonplace, and the strongest steal and hoard what food remains for themselves. The situation is extremely dire, and only a complete takeover is likely to prove effective at this point."
FBK.20.a:0 "This is a humanitarian disaster! Taking over their land would be, not imperialism, but mercy"
FBK.20.b:0 "Sorry, but we simply cannot afford to take on this much responsibility"
FBK.21.t:0 "Upon Deaf Ears"
FBK.21.d:0 "Our offer has been rejected. [From.Owner.GetName] is not interested in taking care of us, and we can expect no help from them."
FBK.21.a:0 "Can we ever catch a break?"
FBK.hillwarriors.t:0 "The Farbrook Hill Warrior Corps"
FBK.hillwarriors.d:0 "Farbrook has today announced that they have established a corps of mountaineers, drawing upon the military experiences of their ancestors. As they are a Federation member, they have sent these soldiers to be part of our joint military, so that the whole Federation can benefit from their skill."
FBK.hilwarriors.a:0 "Excellent news!"
FBK.22.t:0 "Farbrook institutes Federation Day"
FBK.22.d:0 "Farbrook has officially inaugurated today as Federation Day - a national holiday celebrating the greatness of the River Federation and its members. This infectious celebration of civic nationalism has boosted morale slightly across the nation."
FBK.22.a:0 "If only our other States were more like them!"
FBK.23.t:0 "Farbrook secedes from the Federation"
FBK.23.d:0 "Disastrous news! The Regional Governor of Farbrook today declared his state independent of the Federation, claiming they were reclaiming their sovereignty from the 'overbearing hand' of River City. While proclaiming a desire for peaceful relations, he stated in no uncertain terms that Farbrook will decide her own future."
FBK.23.a:0 "Traitors! After all we've done for them! To war!"
FBK.23.b:0 "Lodge a diplomatic protest"
FBK.24.t:0 "The Time Has Come"
FBK.24.d:0 "Farbrook has gone to war with The River Federation. As per our pact with Gering, we are now obliged to join them in this endeavour."
FBK.24.a:0 "To war!"
FBK.24.b:0 "On second thought..."
FBK.25.t:0 "[From.GetName] Honors The River Pact"
FBK.25.d:0 "[From.GetName] has honored our pact and is now at war with the River Federation."
FBK.25.a:0 "Excellent!"
FBK.26.t:0 "[From.GetName] dishonors The River Pact"
FBK.26.d:0 "[From.GetName] has dishonored the River Pact, and has declined to help us in our war against the River Federation."
FBK.26.a:0 "May the crows eat their eyes!"
FBK.27.t:0 "Reorganising The Taken Land"
FBK.27.d:0 "We have won our victory against the River Federation, and now the time has come to distribute land to our allies as we promised. We have taken temporary custodianship of the conquered territory as per the treaty."
FBK.27.a:0 "The spoils of war!"
FBK.28.t:0 "The Spoils Of War"
FBK.28.d:0 "These territorial demands were negotiated prior to the war, and were part of the River Pact."
FBK.28.a:0 "Our allies shall have what they deserve"
FBK.29.t:0 "Farbrook delegates desire the secret of gunpowder"
FBK.29.d:0 "The ponies of Farbrook are laughably primitive, still fighting primarily with spears and blades. They have heard of our guns, however, and now a group of their richest nobles have arrived in River City, asking to purchase the secrets to gunpowder technology. Most see this as harmless, as the Farbrookians are too few and disunited to be a threat. In addition, it would provide a slight bonus to the local economy."
FBK.29.a:0 "It'll be funny to see them marvel over our cast-off muskets and cannons!"
FBK.29.b:0 "I'm not too keen on giving the savages better weapons, even if they're friendly savages..."
FBK.30.t:0 "We Return With Firearms"
FBK.30.d:0 "Success! We have returned with weapons! Furthermore, we have learned much about the manufacture of guns and cannons - we now have access to these useful technologies!"
FBK.30.a:0 "Excellent!"
FBK.31.t:0 "Limited Success"
FBK.31.d:0 "Distressingly, the River ponies attempted to limit our ability to purchase guns from them, or to learn about them. Still, we made off with a fair few, and we have learned much about their manufacture regardless."
FBK.31.a:0 "Darn riverfolk...!"

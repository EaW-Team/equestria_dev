### FOCUS LOCALISATION ####################
###########################################
FBK_industrialise:0 "We have stabilised our government, our leaders agree on a policy of industrialisation (or can force one through against the people's wishes)\n"
FBK_gradualism:0 "We have stabilised our government, and our leaders agree on a policy of gradual growth (or do not have the authoritarian might to force rapid change)\n"
FBK_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Located in the distant North-East of Griffonia, Farbrook is a small feudal society. Chief Cenhelm has led them well, but his term is ending, and some ponies don't think he's tough enough to protect Farbrook in this trying time. Threats loom from within and without. To the North, the grim Arcturian Order keeps at bay the terrible darkness that our sailors can faintly see across the ocean. To the South lie the Riverponies, friendly but inscrutable. To the West prowl the Griffon Knights, historic oppressors and foes of all ponykind. In the face of these perils, will Farbrook turn to extremism? Or will they hold true to the path of Harmony?"
FBK_gradual_approach:0 "Gradual Development"
FBK_gradual_approach_desc:0 "While our country is considered backwards by most of the world, our people have lived on this land for thousands of years, and it would be disastrous and wrong-headed to attempt to radically overhaul this way of life. While we aim to better our nation, we should do so slowly and with care."
FBK_rapid_industrialisation:0 "Rapid Industrialisation"
FBK_rapid_industrialisation_desc:0 "There is no ignoring the fact that we are a backward nation, poor and weak. We will never be able to realise our dreams if we remain as we are - we must modernise and industrialise the nation, whether the people want it or not!"
FBK_cottage_industry:0 "Encourage Cottage Industry"
FBK_cottage_industry_desc:0 "While we don't have as much industry as our more developed neighbours, we are not totally without businesses. Encouraging more of our people to take up smaller crafts such as weaving and smithying should help us to improve our light industry."
FBK_better_shovels:0 "Improved Digging Equipment"
FBK_better_shovels_desc:0 "Most of our ponies are farmers, and till the earth with wooden ploughs and shovels. Developing affordable metal shovels would be of enormous benefit to them."
FBK_ask_RIV_for_help:0 "Bring In Foreign Experts"
FBK_ask_RIV_for_help_desc:0 "We simply don't have the knowledge to perform the kind of industrialisation that we need. Whatever our opinion of them, the Riverponies have a greater knowledge of industry and technology than we do, and it'd be foolish not to ask for their help in these matters. However, our people may not be impressed by our reliance on those less-than-trustworthy foreigners..."
FBK_national_strengthening:0 "National Self-Strengthening Movement"
FBK_national_strengthening_desc:0 "A proud people such as ours cannot trust to foreign help! We must all engage in a valorous scheme of hard labor to improve the quality of our country, without bowing to foreign pressure."
FBK_leverage_religious_schools:0 "Leverage Religious Schools"
FBK_leverage_religious_schools_desc:0 "The few in our society who can read are mostly clerics and those in charge of religious ceremonies and traditions. We should expand their religious schooling institutions and open them up to a wider array of the population, to encourage literacy among our ponies."
FBK_better_crops:0 "Import Hardier Crops"
FBK_better_crops_desc:0 "While we are hesitant to overhaul our way of life, there are a few things we can do which will be uncontroversial, even celebrated. One of these is the importing from our advanced neighbours of tougher, hardier crops that are more resistant to blight, so that more food can be grown and more people fed."
FBK_import_agricultural_tools:0 "Import Agricultural Tools"
FBK_import_agricultural_tools_desc:0 "It is not enough to merely improve our crops, we must also improve the tools we use to plant and harvest them. Importing these and making the farmers use them will dramatically improve our food output."
FBK_industrial_base:0 "Form an Industrial Base"
FBK_industrial_base_desc:0 "It's all very well to talk about cottage industries, but without heavy industry we will never make it in the modern world. We must invest in our future if we want to have one."
FBK_support_local_weaponsmiths:0 "Support Local Weaponsmiths"
FBK_support_local_weaponsmiths_desc:0 "We already possess a number of ponies with substantial knowledge in the creation of weapons. Supporting them and helping them to expand their businesses will make more weapons available to the country as a whole."
FBK_newer_farming_methods:0 "Newer Farming Methods"
FBK_newer_farming_methods_desc:0 "We've heard tell of new ways of planting and harvesting crops that, they say, will nearly double crop output. This is a tantalising possibility, but our farmers will not be happy about having to let go of the old way of doing things..."
FBK_forced_revolution:0 "Forced Revolution"
FBK_forced_revolution_desc:0 "We have seen it in the East, and in the West - the power of the strange device they call a "steam engine". Fast travel! Industry! Power! All of these things could be ours, if only we had the power of the steam engine. We must introduce this power to our nation, regardless of the people's complaints. They will come around once they see the benefits."
FBK_support_landowners:0 "Support The Landowners"
FBK_support_landowners_desc:0 "There has been talk about silly things like "land reform", which have been troubling the best and brightest in our nation. We should formally support the rights of the old landowners, and resolidify the old feudal contracts."
FBK_reformed_landowning:0 "Reformed Land Ownership Laws"
FBK_reformed_landowning_desc:0 "For too long have the feudal landowners tied up the fields and hills in their personal property. We must initiate an extensive land reform, so that the peasantry have a chance at a better life."
FBK_military_industry:0 "An Arms Industry"
FBK_military_industry_desc:0 "Our weaponsmiths simply do not have the ability to make enough weapons to meet our needs. We must invest in new factories, these "armories" we've heard so much about, to arm our new soldiers."
FBK_patriotic_literacy_campaign:0 "Patriotic Literacy Campaign"
FBK_patriotic_literacy_campaign_desc:0 "It is the solemn duty of each and every pony to learn to read, for the good of the nation. How can we be great if we are illiterate? No longer will the nations of east and west laugh at us for being uneducated rubes!"
FBK_preserve_tradition:0 "Preserve Our Traditions"
FBK_preserve_tradition_desc:0 "Our culture is our identity! No matter what else we do, we must not forget who we are. We should institutionalise traditional cultural festivals, stories, and practices, so that our people don't get caught up too much in this "modernisation" thing and forget who they are."
FBK_foreign_education:0 "Education Abroad"
FBK_foreign_education_desc:0 "[Root.GetName] has only so many opportunities for a bright young pony. We should send our most promising youngsters, the minds of the future, to educations in universities in places like Wittenland, Lake City, and Bakara."
FBK_dig_deep_and_greedily:0 "Dig Deep And Greedily"
FBK_dig_deep_and_greedily_desc:0 "The hills of our nation contain substantial mineral deposits, but until now we have not possessed the means to take real advantage of them. We will dig the mines, and open up a new source of revenue for our people. Sure, there may be a few casualties, but what's that in the way of progress?"
FBK_national_stone_road_initiative:0 "National Stone Road Initiative"
FBK_national_stone_road_initiative_desc:0 "It is much to our disgrace that our country's roads are still underdeveloped. We should invest heavily in buliding proper stone roads, like they have in Jezeragrad."
FBK_eternal_tradition:0 "Eternal Tradition"
FBK_eternal_tradition_desc:0 "Our traditions are our culture, and our culture is our identity! We must enshrine our ancient customs into our laws, so that the tides of modernity will not be able to sweep them away."
FBK_the_power_of_steam:0 "The Power Of Steam"
FBK_the_power_of_steam_desc:0 "Strange machines called "steam engines" have been vastly improving the quality of life of many of the Riverponies. While it would cause substantial disruption in our communities, just think of the benefits that we could reap if we were to introduce this technology to our land!"
FBK_dragged_into_the_future:0 "Dragged Into The Future"
FBK_dragged_into_the_future_desc:0 "We have come far in the past few years, but our modernisation program is not yet complete! We must march onwards, to create a new, brighter future for all of us! No matter the cost, [Root.GetName] will not be left behind!"
FBK_start_modernise:0 "Begin Development"
FBK_start_modernise_desc:0 "Our way of life has served us well so far, but the world is changing. We hear stories of distant lands and the great machines that they possess. We must start bringing our country up to date if we wish not to be left behind."
FBK_tractors:0 "Agricultural Tools"
FBK_tractors_desc:0 "Our Farmers still till their fields with ox-drawn ploughs. Importing newfangled mechanical tools from Griffonia would significantly improve the lives of our people."
FBK_new_crops:0 "Higher-Yield Crops"
FBK_new_crops_desc:0 "We see that the Griffons have increased their food production massively by adopting newer crops, that produce more and better fruit. We should copy their example, to ensure our people never go hungry."
FBK_stone_roads:0 "From Dirt Paths to Stone Roads"
FBK_stone_roads_desc:0 "Most of our country is still connected by little more than dirt paths, beaten down by the hooves of generations of ponies. A series of stone roads will greatly improve the ease of both travel and trade within our nation."
FBK_metals:0 "Dig For Heavy Metals"
FBK_metals_desc:0 "Our lands are rich in minerals, but until now we have been able to make only limited use of these. We should establish proper mines to increase our access to these precious natural resources."
FBK_urban1:0 "Promote Urbanisation"
FBK_urban1_desc:0 "As our population increases, more and more ponies are finding that there are simply no jobs for them to do in the countryside. By encouraging these surplus ponies to move to our towns, we can build up our urban centres into bustling metropoles - at least, what passes for a metropolis out in East Griffonia."
FBK_start_trade:0 "Expand Foreign Trade"
FBK_start_trade_desc:0 "Our nation is relatively remote and isolated, and we've never made much of an effort to encourage people to come here. With our new infrastructure it should be easier to convince merchants to travel through our lands, making our country a hub for lucrative trade."
FBK_steam_engine:0 "The Steam Engine"
FBK_steam_engine_desc:0 "We have heard of the wonders of steam from the Griffons, but only now are we realising the full implications of this device. After our new developments, our country is finally ready for the mass adoption of steam power."
FBK_schools_1:0 "Encourage Education"
FBK_schools_1_desc:0 "With our newfound prosperity, it is becoming increasingly obvious that skilled ponies are needed to work the machines of the modern day. We should establish a rudimentary school system to help produce the kind of specialists we need."
FBK_urban2:0 "New Settlements and Towns"
FBK_urban2_desc:0 "Our towns and cities are no longer able to contain our burgeoning population. We must found new towns to give everyone a place to live - which, coincidentally, will further expand business and industry within our country."
FBK_rail:0 "The Iron Pony"
FBK_rail_desc:0 "With the advent of steam, a new way of travel reveals itself to Farbrook - the railway! Capable of speed and stamina that nopony can match, this invention will bring our country even closer together."
FBK_uni:0 "The First Universities"
FBK_uni_desc:0 "Our initial attempts at providing education have proven successful, but we still lack institutes of higher learning. We now have the population to support full-time universities, and they've begin popping up to serve the needs of our ponies."
FBK_entrep:0 "[Root.NameOfIndustryFocusTitle]"
FBK_entrep_desc:0 "[Root.NameOfIndustryFocus]"
FBK_entrep2:0 "Entrepreneurs and Big Business"
FBK_entrep2_desc:0 "With our growing industrialisation, a new class of rich businessponies has come into being. These ponies provide funds out of their own pockets to build privately-held factories, and go abroad to learn business methods from colleges in Griffenheim. The rise of this new class has greatly increased our knowledge of industry."
FBK_central_planning:0 "Central Planning"
FBK_central_planning_desc:0 "With our growing prosperity, we are finally in a position to improve our country's infrastructure. We should establish an economic committee to oversee the planning of our economy."
FBK_industrial_revolution:0 "Industrial Revolution"
FBK_industrial_revolution_desc:0 "Our country has come a long way, and now, with the widespread use of internal combustion, it is about to take another leap into the future."
FBK_council:0 "The Council Deliberates"
FBK_council_desc:0 "Every seven years, the Chieftains of the tribes of Farbrook come together to discuss their plans for the future, as well as who will head the Council until next time. Cenhelm has led us well these last years, but some wonder if he is too soft to save us in the dark times that look to be brewing ahead."
FBK_harmony:0 "Cenhelm was re-elected"
FBK_nonaligned:0 "The Council abolished the role of Chief Speaker"
FBK_fascist:0 "Gering was chosen to lead"
FBK_communist:0 "Communists have taken control of the Council"
FBK_extremist:0 "The Council has lost faith in Cenhelm"
FBK_cenhelm:0 "Stick With What We Know"
FBK_cenhelm_desc:0 "Cenhelm has already proven himself a wise leader - why would we change what's working just fine?"
FBK_friend_north:0 "Friends In The North"
FBK_friend_north_desc:0 "We have always maintained good relations with the neighbouring tribesponies, but until now we have never formalised our friendship. Establishing proper diplomatic relations will pave the wave for closer ties in future."
FBK_friend_RIV:0 "Embassies In The Twin Cities"
FBK_friend_RIV_desc:0 "The River Federation is much larger and more developed than we are. They have wondrous machines that save them so much labor! We'd be fools not to push for closer relations with them - at the very least, we might be able to sponge some of their wealth..."
FBK_trade_WAT:0 "Sacred Water Trade"
FBK_trade_WAT_desc:0 "The Springs of Watertown are sacred, and many of our ponies go to Watertown on pilgrimage. However, they refuse to let the water leave their lands. We should pressure them to open up trade for this water, so that we can bring some of it back home. It'll do more good when everyone has access to it, right?"
FBK_trade_FIR:0 "Firtree Lumber Trade"
FBK_trade_FIR_desc:0 "Firtree, as its name suggests, has the best supplies of yula trees in the whole of Griffonia. These trees produce excellent wood, firm, strong, and light, ideal as building material. However, tribesponies are not exactly known for their business acumen, and this vast resource is going largely untapped. We should take it off of their hooves."
FBK_trade_NCH:0 "Changeling Labor Force"
FBK_trade_NCH_desc:0 "Now that we have opened our borders to our friends from Greneclyf, they have proven their loyalty and industriousness. We should start employing them on a much larger scale, as they will work longer and for less pay than most hillponies."
FBK_arteries_of_wealth:0 "Arteries of Wealth"
FBK_arteries_of_wealth_desc:0 "The arteries of any wealthy nation are its roads and canals. Now we have actual stone roads, but this is not enough to become a major trading power. We must further expand and develop our roads, as well as establishing a system of road-guards to ensure the paths remain free from bandits and other dangers."
FBK_fishing_tradition:0 "Great Fishing Tradition"
FBK_fishing_tradition_desc:0 "Farbrook, being a coastal nation, has always had fisherponies. Many of our greatest legends involve the sea, and it makes up a substantial portion of our economy. We should harness the great wealth of knowledge they've built up over the years."
FBK_purchase_textbooks:0 "Purchase Textbooks"
FBK_purchase_textbooks_desc:0 "Our populace is woefully undereducated. We have begun to set up a school system, but it is very difficult to find good textbooks for our fledgling schools. We should ask the Federation for help - maybe we can buy some of theirs?"
FBK_federal_grant:0 "Federal Development Grant"
FBK_federal_grant_desc:0 "With our growing ties to the River Federation, they have graciously invested in our nation, building factories, housing, and power plants. This co-operation stuff sure seems to work!"
FBK_nimbusian_officers:0 "Nimbusian Officer Corps"
FBK_nimbusian_officers_desc:0 "Nimbusia, one of the states of the River Federation, is home to a whole caste of skilled tacticians and officers. The pegasi there pride themselves on their skill in battle and strategic planning. We should invite some of them to train our officers, which would surely hasten our attempts to reform our primitive army."
FBK_river_trade:0 "Open River Trade"
FBK_river_trade_desc:0 "The Riverponies have many nations, with millions of ponies spread across hill, dell, and plain. At present we have a hard time trading with them over land as Firtree and the Knightly Orders lie between us and them. However, if we expanded our trading fleet, we could sail our ships straight up their great rivers and into their massive cities. Profit for all!"
FBK_deepwater_harbor:0 "Build A Deep Water Harbor"
FBK_deepwater_harbor_desc:0 "While we do have a tradition of fishing in Farbrook, we do not have a port capable of mooring the kind of huge and heavy ships needed for large scale oceangoing trade. We should construct our first ever deep-water harbor in Farbrook Cove, taking advantage of its naturally-sheltered position to house massive ships of trade and of war."
FBK_jewel_of_the_north:0 "Jewel Of The North"
FBK_jewel_of_the_north_desc:0 "After considerable investment, Farbrook is beginning to rise from obscurity. No longer are we a nation of half-savages, prancing in the woods and eating bark - now we are a small but proud trading country, with large harbors and excellent roads. Farbrook is gaining a reputation for itself as the biggest city in the region - the Jewel of the North."
FBK_bitbridle:0 "Bitbridle Rifle Co."
FBK_bitbridle_desc:0 "Farbrook's newfound prosperity has allowed some young, inventive ponies to come up with new ideas. One of these is a young stallion by the name of Bitbridle, who has invented a brand-new rifle design that is cheaper and easier to maintain than the standard-issue. If we employ him to work for us, it will give us a substantial leg up on rifle production."
FBK_cenhelm_academy:0 "Grand Cenhelm Academy"
FBK_cenhelm_academy_desc:0 "With the growth of our nation has come the consequent growth of our intelligentsia. Our initial universities are no longer able to keep up with the demand for higher education. We will establish the Grand Cenhelm University in Farbrook, to act as a centre of learning that will be renowned the world over."
FBK_drill_for_oil:0 "Drill For Oil"
FBK_drill_for_oil_desc:0 "With our newfound technology, we now finally have the capability to drill deep into the rock just offshore of Farbrook Harbor, and we have made an incredible discovery! Farbrook lies directly on top of a massive deposit of oil, just waiting to be tapped! Drilling into this resource will be a massive boon for our nation."
FBK_Farbrook_cement:0 "Farbrook Lime Cement"
FBK_Farbrook_cement_desc:0 "An enterprising young businesscolt has discovered that lime from Farbrook's cliffs, if mixed in correctly, can increase the durability of cement by as much as 30%. This remarkable discovery will dramatically improve the quality of our buildings and construction work - and who knows, maybe we could make a fortune selling this in Rijekograd?"
FBK_republican_guard:0 "Establish the Republican Guard"
FBK_republican_guard_desc:0 "Our nation has never had a formal army, relying instead on the personal armies of the leading chief, or whatever could be mustered from a small cluster of chiefs. Now that we are more developed, we must establish a proper Guard to safeguard our prosperity."
FBK_federal_statehood:0 "Apply For Statehood"
FBK_federal_statehood_desc:0 "The Coalition has invested a substantial amount of money and labor to make us the country that we are today, and many River Ponies have come to settle in our country. Pressure has been mounting from officials and internal citizens alike, asking us to formally join the River Coalition. After much deliberation, we have signed the Treaty of Coltstream and are considered a full Coalition member."
FBK_seperate_but_equal:0 "Seperate But Equal"
FBK_seperate_but_equal_desc:0 "While the Riverfolk have given us much, we are hillponies first and foremost. We should maintain good relations with them, but at the same time assert our independence from them."
FBK_federal_schools:0 "Wittener-Standard Schools"
FBK_federal_schools_desc:0 "Now that we are a full member of the Coalition, we should reform our school system in line with their guidelines. The unicorns of Wittenland are the best-educated, so these are the customs we will adopt. This will of course mean teaching primarily in the Riverpony dialect, which might annoy some traditionalists, but they'll come around."
FBK_political_participation:0 "Increased Political Participation"
FBK_political_participation_desc:0 "Nowadays, our young people are far better-informed and politically aware than their parents or grandparents. This new wave of political consciousness has resulted in massively-increased participation in our political system, greatly strengthening our government."
FBK_free_education:0 "Free Education"
FBK_free_education_desc:0 "Our new wealth has produced great things for our country, but it has changed much too. An uneducated worker can no longer get anything resembling a decent job. Our school system helps, but many of the poorest ponies cannot afford to go to school, espeically in the rural regions. We will establish free primary education for all, to benefit everybody."
FBK_open_borders:0 "Open Borders"
FBK_open_borders_desc:0 "Now that we are part of the Coalition, we are obliged to implement increased freedom of travel between Farbrook and other members. Ponies and Griffons have been emigrating here in small numbers ever since we began our economic rise, but with the passing of these laws, the floodgates will be opened and our population should skyrocket."
FBK_northern_capital:0 "Capital Of The North"
FBK_northern_capital_desc:0 "Farbrook has earned a reputation as the greatest city in the North, and we will keep it that way. By redoubling our investment in industry, we will ensure that we deserve the title 'Capital of the North'."
FBK_home_of_the_hill_warrior:0 "Home Of The Hill Warrior"
FBK_home_of_the_hill_warrior_desc:0 "The ponies of Farbrook have always been known for their expertise in hilly and mountainous terrain. Even though we are now a more civilised nation, we keep this legacy alive. We will make these skilled warriors a key part of our contribution to the Coalition military, which should strengthen the alliance as a whole."
FBK_new_generation:0 "A New Generation of Leaders"
FBK_new_generation_desc:0 "At last, our education investment have borne fruit. The newest generation of ponies possesses levels of political engagement and civic pride unheard of in our history, and greater even than that of the ancient Republics of western Griffonia. This will truly be a generation of great leaders, and we are sure they will accomplish great things."
FBK_expand_republican_guard:0 "Expand The Republican Guard"
FBK_expand_republican_guard_desc:0 "The Republican Guard is not large enough to ensure our safety against the rising threats of this world. Without the Federation to protect us, we must expand the Guard so that we are ready to deal with anything that comes our way - be it from North, South, or West."
FBK_federation_day:0 "Unity Day"
FBK_federation_day_desc:0 "Now that we are a true member of the River Coalition, we should establish this day as a proper holiday, to celebrate. Students will be given the day off, and parades will be organised to commemmorate the friendships that have brought us such happiness and comfort."
FBK_constitution:0 "Write A Constitution"
FBK_constitution_desc:0 "Our great nation does not as of yet have a true Constitution, setting out precisely what the fundamental rights, liberties, and responsibilities of each citizen are. We must write this great document so that the hillponies will have their rights protected from grasping and unjust businessmen and politicians."
FBK_star_of_the_north:0 "Star of the North"
FBK_star_of_the_north_desc:0 "As we look back on how far we've come, we realise that Farbrook is now a truly great nation. With heads held high, we march onwards bravely into the future. The Star of the North shines ever brightly! Farbrook forever!"
FBK_council_coup:0 "Council Consolidates Power"
FBK_council_coup_desc:0 "Why should any one Chief have pre-eminence among the many, diverse peoples of our nation? If we are to face the dark times ahead, we must face them together as equals."
FBK_gering:0 "Glory To Farbrook"
FBK_gering_desc:0 "Hermane Gering has earned the Council's approval to lead Farbrook for the next seven years. He will lead it to glory, or die trying."
FBK_thenorth:0 "Shelter From The Black Crusade"
FBK_thenorth_desc:0 "Disaster! Our longstanding guardians, the Arcturian Order, have fallen to the Dread Leaugue! We must scramble to defend ourselves - this could be the end of the world!"
FBK_extremism:0 "Radical Leadership"
FBK_extremism_desc:0 "The Council has lost faith in Cenhelm's ability to lead us. The lot now falls between two ponies. Applethorn is Chief of the Tanglebriar Tribe, and absorbed strange ideas during her youth spent in Prywhen. On the other hoof, Hermane Gering, the stern warrior chief of the White Hooves clan, with his dreams of Empire."
FBK_comm:0 "Communists Take Control of the Council"
FBK_comm_desc:0 "The Council has chosen to let the Stallionists rule Farbrook for the next few years. Their first action was to dissolve the council and declare Farbrook a sovereign People's Republic, by the workingpony, and for the workingpony."
FBK_suppression:0 "Quell Dissent"
FBK_suppression_desc:0 "There are those who think that our new form of government is unjust and untraditional. In the interests of maintaining peace and stability, we must show these neigh-sayers what's what."
FBK_imperialism:0 "Imperialist Dreams"
FBK_imperialism_desc:0 "Who says that Farbrook is a backwater? Fools! The greatness of a nation is measured by the strength of its spirit, and in time, its borders will inevitably change to reflect that spirit. We are Hill Ponies! We are strong!"
FBK_military_education:0 "A Military Education"
FBK_military_education_desc:0 "A great kingdom is built on the back of victory in battle, and victory in battle is built on the back of skilled leadership. We must provide formal education for our officer corps if we are to have any realistic hope of glory."
FBK_warrior_tithe:0 "The Warrior Tithe"
FBK_warrior_tithe_desc:0 "Up until now, we have had a very haphazard military, mostly thrown together from the warriors that individuals tribes could spare. This will not do for our glorious new state! We must institute the Warrior's Tithe - each tribe must send a certain percentage of their young stallions to serve in the armed forces or face severe punishment."
FBK_armories:0 "Establish Armories"
FBK_armories_desc:0 "Our industrial weapons production lags woefully behind the times. We must have proper military industry if we are to attain the greatness that is our destiny."
FBK_schooling_for_service:0 "Schooling For Service"
FBK_schooling_for_service_desc:0 "Our officer schools have been a smashing success, however it is difficult for an educated officer to get the best out of illiterate soldiers. We should establish military academies to provide education to our soldiers in the field."
FBK_griffon_tactics:0 "Griffon-Style Tactics"
FBK_griffon_tactics_desc:0 "While our past relations with them are rocky at best, we must admit that the Griffons' military tactics are superior to our own. We should study them in order to improve the performance of our armies on the battlefield."
FBK_four_hooves:0 "Our Own Four Hooves"
FBK_four_hooves_desc:0 "We need no allies! Farbrook shall stand tall and proud, the greatest of all pony nations!"
FBK_beseech_the_emperor:0 "Beseech The Emperor"
FBK_beseech_the_emperor_desc:0 "The wretched River Federation stands in the way of our ambitions. Despite our rocky history with them, the Griffonian Empire is a strong and rising power that we could use as a means to an end. We shall send a proposition to Griffenheim, offering our loyalty in exchange for aid. The fools..."
FBK_princely_ally:0 "Visit To Jezeragrad"
FBK_princely_ally_desc:0 "While most Riverponies are soft and weak, Prince Heavenly Snow of Lake City is a different kind of pony. He truly understands what it means to be strong! He would make a useful ally in our quest for National Glory. Even if he were not, the fact remains that he has guns, and we need guns."
FBK_stormtroopers:0 "Stormtroopers"
FBK_stormtroopers_desc:0 "It is obvious that we can rely on ourselves, and only on ourselves. Only by embracing fully our glorious history of mountain warfare can we truly find greatness."
FBK_imperial_equipment:0 "Imperial Equipment"
FBK_imperial_equipment_desc:0 "As part of our deal with the Emperor, we have been granted licenses to large numbers of the Empire's guns, to ensure that our troops are on par with those of the Riverfolk."
FBK_coop:0 "A Military Exchange"
FBK_coop_desc:0 "Our newfound allies have much to teach us, but we also have much we can show them. In particular, we are experienced in the ways of mountain warfare, while they have better guns than we do. We will offer them a trade - we will train their soldiers in the intricacies of mountain warfare, in exchange for assistance with modernising our firearms."
FBK_coldmouth:0 "The Coldmouth Corridor"
FBK_coldmouth_desc:0 "It is undeniable that all hillponies should be under one nation - but there are hill ponies living in Coldmouth, under Firtree! This is an outrage - we must be prepared to use every measure up to and including war to right this wrong."
FBK_fate_of_villages:0 "Fate of the Villages"
FBK_fate_of_villages_desc:0 "All the Northern Ponies must be united under one banner - and that banner will be ours."
FBK_southern_question:0 "The Southern Question"
FBK_southern_question_desc:0 "Now that Gering has achieved some of his goals, the question inevitably rises as to what to do regarding the lands to the South and East. They are bountiful and would be good to conquer, but Gering must carefully measure the balance of power in the region before making a decision - a wrong turn here could mean the end of his regime."
FBK_southern_friends:0 "The Prince and the Chieftain"

FBK_renege_on_deal:0 "Renege On Our Deal"
FBK_renege_on_deal_desc:0 "Gering, though grateful for the aid he's received from Lake City, sees which way the wind is blowing. He does not believe that Heavenly Snow can defeat the River Republic and its puppets, and has decided to cut his losses before things start going disastrously wrong."
FBK_stab_in_the_back:0 "The Stab In The Back"
FBK_stab_in_the_back_desc:0 "How could we ever align ourselves permanently with RIVERPONIES - the very worst enemy of our own race, next to Griffons? It should be obvious to any educated pony that oaths made to such savages cannot be considered binding. We will take advantage of their gullibility, and destroy them!"
FBK_rapprochement:0 "Rapprochement With The Coalition"
FBK_rapprochement_desc:0 "Our current gains are substantial in and of themselves, and it would be foolish to overstretch ourselves when we are already near our limit. Now that we have taken Lake City, we should push for friendly relations with the remaining Coalition members, so that we can consolidate our gains."
FBK_conquer_riverfolk:0 "Conquer The Riverfolk"
FBK_conquer_riverfolk_desc:0 "Now that we have taken Jezeragrad, we have proven decisively that hillponies are superior to riverponies. Clearly, it is our sovereign destiny to rule the entire riverlands! Glory to Farbrook! Glory to Gering!"
FBK_north_alone:0 "The North Stands Alone"

FBK_independent_kingdom:0 "An Independent People"
FBK_independent_kingdom_desc:0 "The hillponies desire and have always desired only one thing - that they may be able to live their lives under their own laws, free and sovereign, unchained to any foreign despot. This freedom they shall have, no matter what the cost!"
FBK_consolidate_north:0 "Consolidate The North"
FBK_consolidate_north_desc:0 "The other hillponies have mostly accepted our rule, but there are some dissenters, and the situation is less than perfect. We should spend our time ensuring that each and every pony understands the importance of peace, order, and stability."

FBK_eastern_expansion:0 "Begin Eastern Expansion"

FBK_for_the_empire:0 "For The Empire"
FBK_for_the_empire_desc:0 "We have committed to the service of the Griffonian Empire, and committed to that service we shall remain. Farbrook has always been a small, insignificant nation, but within the Empire, we will have a chance at true glory."
FBK_west_is_the_new_north:0 "West Is The New North"
FBK_west_is_the_new_north_desc:0 "In the past, many hillponies have harbored ill sentiments towards the Griffons of the West, but our wise and broad-minded Chieftain sees beyond such petty tribalism. He recognises that the Griffons of the West represent a superior culture to our own, and that it would only be to our benefit to emulate them and learn from them."
FBK_a_new_duke:0 "A New Duke In The North"
FBK_a_new_duke_desc:0 "Now that we have begun our Westernisation program, it is only fitting that we modernise not only our technology but our government. Since we are planning formal integration into the Empire, it would be unseemly to continue to use the barbaric title of "Chieftain". Farbrook will be reorganised as a Duchy, and the legal code will be changed to be more like that of Griffonia."
FBK_griffonian_cultural_reform:0 "Griffonian Cultural Reform"
FBK_griffonian_cultural_reform_desc:0 "Now that our technology and our laws more closely match those of our western neighbours, it is only logical that we should adopt their manners also. Greifensprache will be adopted as the official language of our nation, and our nobles will follow after the styles of the Imperial Court. Surely, this shows our sophistication?"
FBK_marry_princess:0 "Marry A Princess"
FBK_marry_princess_desc:0 "Now that we have thoroughly acculturated ourselves to the Griffons of the West, we look every inch a Griffonian nation. There remains only one thing left to secure our position - a true Royal Marriage, with one of the deceased Emperor's young cousins, no less! Though the marriage may be...complicated, I'm sure it will work out."
FBK_crown_gering:0 "A King In The North"
FBK_crown_gering_desc:0 "In a solemn ceremony at the Royal Halls, Chieftain Gering was today granted the title of King of The North. To the jubilant crowds on onlookers, the new King declared that the hillponies were now a truly great nation, and vowed to protect and guide them every day of his life, till his bloodline should fail."
FBK_war_RIV:0 "War with the Riverfolk"
FBK_war_RIV_desc:0 "Our moment has finally come. So far the river ponies have been too cowardly to oppose our conquests, despite being in a position to do so, but there can be no more waiting. We will strike down the River Federation or we will die trying!"
FBK_final_struggle:0 "The Final Struggle"

FBK_reconciliation:0 "Reconciliation Efforts"
FBK_reconciliation_desc:0 "Despite our longtime hatred for the Federation and all that it stood for, we must admit it had some good ideas.

FBK_honor_oath_desc:0 "We achieved this victory through the aid of our stalwart allies, the Griffon Empire, and promised them fealty.

FBK_politburo:0 "First Worker's Constitutional Congress"
FBK_politburo_desc:0 "The Revolution has been successful! Now that the reactionaries have been suppressed, it falls to us to safeguard the Socialist State by electing a leader to guide us.

FBK_vanguard:0 "Applethorn's Revolutionary Vanguard Party"
FBK_vanguard_desc:0 "Comrade Applethorn spent her youth adventuring in the south, and spent years working for the Prywhen People's Liberation Army.

FBK_7yrplan:0 "Seven-Year Plan"
FBK_7yrplan_desc:0 "Farbrook is woefully behind the times, even by the standards of relatively-backwards Griffonia. If our Revolution is to survive, it is absolutely imperative that we industralise and bring ourselves into the modern world - no matter the cost or the strain."
FBK_soc_ed:0 "Socialist Education"

FBK_new_manifesto:0 "Compose The New Manifesto"
FBK_new_manifesto_desc:0 "Our socialist state is still very young. In the interests of stability, we should write and publish a manifesto, to be made available free to all ponies, explaining the purpose, beliefs, powers, restrictions, and functionings of the new government."
FBK_agrarian:0 "Hempstrand's Socialist Agrarian Party"
FBK_agrarian_desc:0 "Hempstrand used to be a community leader in nearby Watertown before he was expelled on trumped-up grounds.

FBK_tribal:0 "First Principle: Harmony With The Land"
FBK_tribal_desc:0 "Hempstrand recognises that much of the evil in the world comes from our inability to live in a correct relationship with nature. To this end, we must abolish the false distinctions we make between ourselves and the creatures of the earth - such things as stone buildings, plows, and industrial machines must all go!"
FBK_peace:0 "Second Principle: Harmony With The World"

FBK_egalitarianism:0 "Third Principle: Harmony With Each Other"
FBK_egalitarianism_desc:0 "The Final Principle of Hempstrand is the abolition of distinctions between each other. Mother, father, mare, stallion, pony, and griffon - all of these are meaningless. These bonds are really chains, chains that must be broken if we are to be truly free."
FBK_famine:0 "Disastrous Famine"
FBK_famine_desc:0 "Disaster! Hempstrand's forced primitivisation of Farbrook has left it with more ponies than its new lack of infrastructure can support. There is not enough food to feed everyone, and something must be done before thousands starve to death!"
FBK_collapse:0 "Social Collapse"
FBK_collapse_desc:0 "The first thing that the furious ponies of Farbrook did was to ask Hempstrand to help them. He only responded by saying that this was an unfortunate but necessary step in the perfecting of the Communist society. Needless to say, they weren't happy with that..."
FBK_begging:0 "Beg For Food"
FBK_begging_tooltip:0 "This will unlock decisions that let you beg other countries for food."

FBK_NCH_absorb:0 "Beg Greneclyf"
FBK_NCH_absorb_desc:0 "We are out of food, out of leaders, and out of options. We do not have the strength to rebuild ourselves, not in time to prevent thousands of deaths. We must beg our ancient friends, the Changelings of Greneclyf for help. We will ask them to rule us instead - at least they have food."
FBK_RIV_absorb:0 "Beg The Riverfolk"
FBK_RIV_absorb_desc:0 "We never thought it would come to this, but we have no options left. The River Federation has food - let us ask them for help, in exchange for our sovereignty. We obviously aren't capable of ruling ourselves..."
FBK_new_soviet_pony:0 "New Soviet Pony"
FBK_new_soviet_pony_desc:0 "It is obvious that our nature, warped by capitalism, has rendered us incapable of living as TRUE Communists. We must create a newer, braver, more selfless pony if the Revolution is to succeed in the long term."
FBK_rural_electrification:0 "Rural Electrification"
FBK_rural_electrification_desc:0 "Our construction efforts have so far been primarily focused on the more densely-populated areas of our country.

FBK_NESU:0 "North Eastern Socialist Union"
FBK_NESU_desc:0 "At last, comrades, we are ready! All internal threats have been quelled, and the ponies of Farbrook have been brought to our side. We are now ready to establish a great Soviet Union, a Communistic alliance that will spread socialism all over the North and East!"
FBK_economic_dev:0 "Develop Our Comrades"
FBK_economic_dev_desc:0 "All socialists should stand together against capitalist imperialism - fine words, comrade, but without industry they will remain no more than that. We must help our comrades in NESU to bring their industries up to scratch."
FBK_arm_revolution:0 "Arm The Northern Revolution"
FBK_arm_revolution_desc:0 "As we have said before, comrades, zeal means nothing without weapons. We must help our comrades in NESU to construct potent militias that will help us to work together effectively against the capitalist swine."
FBK_workers_paradise:0 "Worker's Paradise"
FBK_workers_paradise_desc:0 "Now that the Revolution in the Northeast is secure, we should turn our attention inwards. By creating the greatest socialist state in the world, we will act as a shining beacon to all the oppressed workers of the world!"
FBK_buy_guns:0 "Buy Guns From The River Federation"
FBK_buy_guns_desc:0 "Our armies are woefully behind the times. We have heard tell of 'gunpowder', and the way it has revolutionised warfare among the riverponies - we should send a delegation to them to see if we can acquire some of these 'firearms' for ourselves."
FBK_rein_in_chiefs:0 "Rein In The Chieftains"
FBK_rein_in_chiefs_desc:0 "Our "army" is nothing more than a motley collection of tribal warriors loaned by the various tribal leaders. This causes significant organisational problems. If we are to have any chance of surviving in this changing world, we need to reduce the power of the chiefs."
FBK_encourage_weaponsmiths:0 "Encourage Weaponsmiths"
FBK_encourage_weaponsmiths_desc:0 "Currently all of our weapons are made by hoof, keeping our output low. These smiths have wildly varying levels of skill and experience, and there are not enough of them to support our burgeoning army. We must encourage more ponies to go into the weaponmaking trade if we are to be able to protect the future of Farbrook."
FBK_logistics:0 "Battlefield Specialists"
FBK_logistics_desc:0 "As long as there has been war, there have been those who wait upon the warriors - cupbearers, field surgeons, mere laborers and load bearers. However, some of the devices we have seen in the armies of the River ponies are astounding to us. We must acquire some of these 'support tools', to keep our ponies fighting longer and more effectively."
FBK_post_tribal_army:0 "Post-Tribal Army"
FBK_post_tribal_army_desc:0 "Our armed forces are ill-disciplined and badly organised, often with conflicting loyalties. We must reform the army and introduce an explicit chain of command, as well as the beginnings of an officer corps."
FBK_basic_planning:0 "Rudimentary Planning"
FBK_basic_planning_desc:0 "Up until now, our military strategy has consisted of little more than charging at the enemy, or finding slightly different ways to do so. This will no longer suffice - we should study the tactics used by the River Federation, to help us form useful battle plans, suitable for the modern war."
FBK_basic_firepower:0 "Fundamentals of Firepower"
FBK_basic_firepower_desc:0 "The guns that we have bought from the Riverponies have shown us a new way of war - a manner vastly superior to our old ways. However, we are not yet familiar with the best ways to use these weapons. We must invest more time to studying the usage of these new firearms."
FBK_basic_mass:0 "The New Horde"
FBK_basic_mass_desc:0 "In ancient days, the warriors of the North were infamous for their hordes - groups of warriors that would raid nearby towns and caravans, attacking in swarms that overwhelmed their enemies. While crude, these tactics were effective, and they will serve as a useful foundation for our strategies in the future."
FBK_engineers:0 "The Importance of Engineering"
FBK_engineers_desc:0 "One surprising development that we have learned from our study of strategy is the importance of engineers - those ponies who dig and fortify trenches. We should invest in the technology necessary to field these forces, for all our texts report that a good engineering corps is vital to success in war."
FBK_bigger_guns:0 "Buy Bigger Guns"
FBK_bigger_guns_desc:0 "The success of the firearms we have already gotten our hooves on has convinced us that this is the key to victory in future. If guns equal victory, then surely bigger guns equals MORE victory!"
FBK_peasants_in_the_army:0 "Peasants In The Army"
FBK_peasants_in_the_army_desc:0 "Up until now, only the higher classes could serve as true warriors, the peasants being forced to fight only in desperate times. This must change - we will provide for proper training for peasants who prove themselves, and open the army to them in order to increase the size of our army."
FBK_industrial_military:0 "Industrialised Military"
FBK_industrial_military_desc:0 "Now that our society has developed and our army is better trained, we can go about crushing the last vestiges of tribal hierarchy within our armed forces, making them a more effective fighting force."
FBK_gbp_2:0 "Improved Doctrines"

FBK_sfp_2:0 "Volley Fire Training"
FBK_sfp_2_desc:0 "With the increased industrialisation of our armed forces comes the need for improved firepower. We will implement new training regimes to ensure that our army keeps pace with its contemporaries."
FBK_mass_2:0 "Great Patriotic Army"
FBK_mass_2_desc:0 "With our army being larger and more prestigious than ever, many new stallions desire to join. We must develop our tactics such that they are suitable for armies of massive size."
FBK_modern_military:0 "A Modern Military"
FBK_modern_military_desc:0 "At long last, we have finished our army reforms. Our army is now comparable to those of the most advanced nations in terms of army tactics and equipment. With this, our safety should be secure."
FBK_navy:0 "Establish a Navy"
FBK_navy_desc:0 "Though we have a longstanding tradition of fishing, we hardly have anything that could be called a Navy. Now that we have come out of the darkness of savagery, we should found a port so that we can properly construct a fleet."
FBK_fleet_in_being:0 "Adopt Fleet-In-Being Doctrine"
FBK_fleet_in_being_desc:0 "Now that we are in the process of establishing a navy, we must decide upon a naval strategy. Some officers recommend following a doctrine they heard about in Bakara, focussing on maintaining large standing navies."
FBK_trade_interdiction:0 "Adopt Trade Interdiction Doctrine"
FBK_trade_interdiction_desc:0 "Now that we are in the process of establishing a navy, we must decide upon a naval strategy. Some officers recommmend a doctrine they learned of in the naval academy in Bakara, focussing on the attacking of an enemy's trade vessels."

FBK_airforce:0 "The Flying Hillponies"
FBK_airforce_desc:0 "For thousands of years, it has been the fate of hillponies to look on in envy as Pegasi soared through the air. Now, we have caught wind of a new technology that will allow us to finally surpass the limitations placed on us by nature."
FBK_fighters:0 "Buy Fighter Planes"
FBK_fighters_desc:0 "We don't have much experience in this field, so we must look outwards for help. We have heard that 'fighter planes' are the keys to ensuring control of the skies, so we will focus on importing those first."
FBK_bombers:0 "Buy Bombers"
FBK_bombers_desc:0 "We don't have much experience in this field, so we must look outwards for help. We have heard that 'bombers' are key to modern warfare, for they can drop large loads of munitions on the enemy without giving them the chance to fight back. Surely we should focus on importing these first?"
FBK_air_strat:0 "Develop Aerial Tactics"
FBK_air_strat_desc:0 "Now that we have some aeroplanes, we are starting to get used to the idea of air combat. Some of our most skilled pilots are starting to get ideas about how best to employ our new planes. Since we don't really know any better ourselves, it's probably a good idea to listen to them."
FBK_standard_recruitment:0 "Regularise Recruitment Practices"
FBK_standard_recruitment_desc:0 "Presently, our "army" consists of levied troops raised by local lords, called upon in times of need. While this served us well for centuries, it is pitifully unsuited to the modern era. We must implement a single, standard practice for recruiting soldiers, ensuring a sense of stability and national unity, as recruitment practices will now be the same across the realm."
FBK_state_weaponry:0 "State-Provided Weaponry"
FBK_state_weaponry_desc:0 "Our soldiers come to the front with weapons they scavenged by themselves - sometimes an ancestral weapon, sometimes a cheap spear, or a weapon provided by their lord if they're lucky. This hodge-podge will not stand up to the modern war. We must ensure that we provide standardised, high-quality weapons for all of our troops."
FBK_proper_pay:0 "Paid Soldiers"
FBK_proper_pay_desc:0 "Presently, our troops are mere levies, more akin to militia than true soldiers. In order to develop a proper army, we must have professional soldiers, and war cannot be your profession unless you can earn a steady wage from it. We must establish standard pay rates for what a full-time soldier can expect."
FBK_reformed_militia:0 "Reform The Tribal Militia"
FBK_reformed_militia_desc:0 "Our present levies would do better as a loosely-organised 'militia' - a group of small armies, still led by local lords, but incorporating more advanced tactics, and more closely tied to the state for their pay and supplies of weapons. This would enable us to forge a modern army without the intense expense of full centralisation, but would still be somewhat controversial."
FBK_standard_army:0 "A Standing Army For [Root.GetName]"
FBK_standard_army_desc:0 "Without a true standing army, we will never be a great nation. We must fully centralise and control our permanent armed forces, regardless of what the chieftains think."
FBK_small_unit_tactics:0 "Small Unit Tactics"
FBK_small_unit_tactics_desc:0 "Our Militia already know how to act in small bands, led by local lords. By adopting more advanced tactics, we can take our prior experience, and put it to good use by training our army to operate in small squads, designed to move quickly and pick off the enemy piece by piece."
FBK_import_foreign_instructors:0 "Import Foreign Instructors"
FBK_import_foreign_instructors_desc:0 "We are surrounded by nations with superior militaries - the Griffon Empire to the West, the ponies of Nimbusia to the East, and the Knights of Helquill to the South. We should import some of their soldiers and ex-soldiers to teach us how to execute proper, well-organised battle plans."
FBK_discipline_and_drills:0 "Discipline And Drills"
FBK_discipline_and_drills_desc:0 "Discipline, Discipline, Discipline, that's what makes a pony into a true soldier. Our stallions aren't yet used to the sort of rigorous discipline needed in a modern army, so they must be drilled, over and over, until their morale can withstand any blow."
FBK_supplementary_mercenaries:0 "Supplement Our Militia With Mercenaries"
FBK_supplementary_mercenaries_desc:0 "While our Militias are certainly brave, they are lacking in a certain degree of professionalism, and it is very difficult to bring them up to that level while keeping the structure as decentralised as we would like. To make up for this, we should hire and intergrate mercenaries into our army, to bolster our strength."
FBK_standardised_uniforms:0 "Issue Standard Uniforms"
FBK_standardised_uniforms_desc:0 "If our army is to be truly professional, they must have standard uniforms! Uniforms not only make it easier to see who is who on the battlefield, they are also an essential part of building up esprit de corps - that sense of camaraderie that is so essential to a professional army."
FBK_guerilla_warfare:0 "Guerrilla Warfare Strategems"
FBK_guerilla_warfare_desc:0 "Guerrilla Warfare is the art of using irregular tactics and superior mobility to attack a larger, less mobile force, especially when you know the terrain better. Given our relatively decentralised army structure, adopting these tactics would fit perfectly into our way of war."
FBK_the_introduction_of_artillery:0 "Introduce Artillery"
FBK_the_introduction_of_artillery_desc:0 "We have heard of how foreign armies rely heavily on big guns known as "artillery" to destroy their enemies. We can hardly call ourselves a modern military if we do not develop artillery of our own!"
FBK_chain_of_command:0 "The Chain Of Command"
FBK_chain_of_command_desc:0 "Traditionally, our armies were led by tribal chieftains, most of whom barely cooperated at all. This arrangement made carrying out any kind of unified strategy an impossibility. We have already made steps to counteract this, but we must finally crush the last vestiges of this old hierarchy, establishing a true chain of command that is independent of tribal loyalty."
FBK_support_companies:0 "The Idea of Support Squads"
FBK_support_companies_desc:0 "Engineers, Scouts, Logistics Personnel - each of these types of ponies don't get as much glory as the frontline fighters, but they are at least as important to the success of the army. We must expand our Support companies if we hope to survive in the modern world."
FBK_flying_columns:0 "The Flying Columns"
FBK_flying_columns_desc:0 "The Flying Column is the culmination of our highly-mobile, small-squad tactics. These bands of soldiers act in many ways like the old warbands of yore, roving the countryside, appearing from nowhere to strike at the enemy or sever their supply lines before vanishing back into the hills. They will carry the fight to our enemies, at home and abroad."
FBK_modern_discipline:0 "Esprit  De Corps"
FBK_modern_discipline_desc:0 "With constant training, our army has reached a level of professionalism that would put even many of Griffonia's largest armed forces to shame. Each and every soldier thinks of themselves as part of a family, and will fight and die for his band of brothers as he would for his own flesh and blood."
FBK_new_ideas_for_a_new_age:0 "New Ideas For A New Age"
FBK_new_ideas_for_a_new_age_desc:0 "We have already come very far, from a feudal levy system to a modern, professional army. In the process, we have gained an enormous amount of experience, experience which can be channelled into bettering the future development of our armed forces."
FBK_utopia:0 "Utopia Achieved"
FBK_utopia_desc:0 "At last, Hempstrand's policies have come to fruition! Fillies and colts dance in the meadows, perfectly in harmony with nature. Greed and selfishness have been eliminated, and each pony contributes according to his ability, and takes according to his need."

FBK_feeling_unsafe_idea:0 "The Unprotected North"
FBK_feeling_unsafe_idea_desc:0 "The wild northlands of Griffonia are dangerous, and unlike the hicks in Firtrees and Watertown, we cannot afford to close our eyes to danger. Dark magic, the rising dead? Diamond Dogs and Griffon Knights? Any one of these things could destroy us, and the ponies of Farbrook feel the need for protection. If not dealt with, this may drive them to extremism..."
FBK_the_white_hooves_idea:0 "White Hoof Insurrectionists"
FBK_the_white_hooves_idea_desc:0 "Among the many tribes of Farbrook, the White Hooves are most notorious for their warlike, extremist behaviour. Their chieftain, Hermane Gering is not a stallion to be trifled with. He is not just the largest brute among his similars, but a dangerous and cunning leader with a vision for the future."
FBK_comm_agitators_idea:0 "NESP Agitators"
FBK_comm_agitators_idea_desc:0 "Although industrialisation and workers' rights are unfamiliar concepts to many ponies in Farbrook, this hasn't stopped the NESP from operating in Farbrook. Even if this land is largely agrarian, and thus unsuitable for the workers' revolution according to Marks, they argue that it offers an unique opportunity for creating a pure socialist society."

FBK_army_power_high_desc:0 "The Army has great influence in our society.

FBK_construct_a_capital_ship:0 "Construct A Capital Ship"
FBK_construct_a_capital_ship_desc:0 "Bakaran Doctrine focuses on Capital Ships - but we don't exactly have the resources to build many of those. We should focus on the small things first - put all of our efforts into designing and building one great ship, and use that as the backbone of our navy. The only choice left is whether to build a Battleship or a Carrier."

EAW_WS_FBK:0 "Farbrook - Home of the Hillponies"
EAW_WS_FBK_desc:0 "In the far north-east of the Griffonian Continent, there lie many scattered settlements of ponies. The most northerly of these is Farbrook, a collection of villages and towns centered on the great (by northern standards) central city of Farbrook proper.\n\nIn 1007, the ponies of Farbrook are very worried. Though their leader, §YCenhelm§!, has proven capable, his seven-year stint as elected high chief is coming to a close, and the Grand Council will soon meet to choose who should be leader over all the villages. Cenhelm has an impressive record, but many factors are in play that could scuttle his chances at a second term. The most notable problems facing Farbrook can be grouped into two broad categories - §Yexternal danger§! and §Yinternal dissent.§! Farbrook is small, weak, and well aware of both of these facts, and its ponies are none too happy about that. We need to find some way to §Yprotect ourselves§!, whether this be through a §Ystrong military§! or through §Ymaking friends§! with others.\n\nThe internal threat is related to the external one - the fear of attack, and the knowledge of our vulnerability both make Farbrook ponies paranoid, and if the problem is not addressed quickly enough, they will be increasingly open to §Rradical voices§! who offer easy solutions. Both the §YNorth Eastern Socialist Party§! and the vicious, warlike §YWhite Hooves Clan§! offer solutions to this problem, both involving rapid militarisation and vigorous suppression of internal enemies. It is unlikely, but possible, that the §YCouncil could listen to them§! instead of Cenhelm. Even if they do not, danger would not be completely averted, as Cenhelm would then need to §Ydeal with them himself§! to ensure stability.\n\nFarbrook is surrounded mostly by neutral or friendly nations, and have an §Yespecially strong bond§! with the changelings of §YGreneclyf§!, across the sea. If anything were to happen to them, they would probably turn to us for help first. To the South lies the §YRiver Coalition.§! They see us as their long-lost cousins, and oughtn't be a threat, but nobody can be sure if they truly have our best interests at heart. Finally, to the south-west lies §RHellquill§!, the Griffon knightly order that has ravaged the eastern ponies for centuries. They are almost certain to end up as a threat, one way or another."

FBK.3.t:0 "A Proposal From The East"
FBK.3.d:0 "An pony envoy sought an audience with the Regent today, and offered a most interesting proposal. She claimed to come from the far east, from a backwards nation called Farbrook. We recognised the name as one of the clans of savages that the Knightly Orders have been charged with guarding our Eastern border from for centuries now. The envoy claimed that Farbrook regrets their history of animosity with us, and claims her leader, Hermane Gering, asks for help. Gering wishes to unite the Ponies of the Eastern Hills and plains, but the River Federation is posing a major obstacle to this, and he asks for our aid in defeating them. In exchange, Gering offers his obedience to the crown, offering the Eastern lands to us if we will but allow him to administrate them."
FBK.3.a:0 "Offer him weapons and technical assistants. We have much to gain and little to lose."
FBK.3.b:0 "We are not interested in the affairs of savages."
FBK.4.t:0 "A Request From The North"
FBK.4.d:0 "A messenger came from the frigid North today. He claimed to speak on behalf of Hermane Gering, Chieftain of the hillponies of Farbrook. Chieftain Gering has expressed his admiration for our governance and military might, and has offered gifts of silver, gold, and rare furs to the Prince. He formally requests military aid, for weapons of good make are hard to come by in his part of the world, and he sees that we have the kind of vision that is so lacking in most River Ponies. He has also made amicable conversation with the Prince in private, discussing the possibility of an alliance between our two nations in future."

Chieftain Gering is offering us a simple deal: agree to go to war with the Federation alongside Gering, and we will be granted a large chunk of the spoils, gaining access to the rich floodplains and farmlands of the River Valleys. What will our response be?"
FBK.5.a:0 "The lands are fertile...tell him we accept."
FBK.5.b:0 "This isn't in our best interest."
FBK.6.t:0 "The Empire is Interested"
FBK.6.d:0 "Our messenger arrived from Griffenheim yesterday, with excellent news - the Empire has accepted our offer. Military advisors, weapons, and personnel will be delivered to us for the war effort, though the Empire is not willing to commit itself personally to a war in the East. Of course, they DO expect our pledge of alleigance in exchange..."

FBK.7.t:0 "Imperial Scorn"
FBK.7.d:0 "Ill news has returned to us this day: the Empire is not interested in helping us against the Federation. They are unwilling to commit themselves to a war in the East without better hope of a profit for themselves."

FBK.8.t:0 "The Prince Accepts"

FBK.10.t:0 "The Zebras sign the River Pact"
FBK.10.d:0 "An envoy arrived this morning, bring word from the Zebra nation that they have accepted our deal. In return for land, they will help us to defeat the River Ponies."
FBK.10.a:0 "They may look odd, but they will be useful nonetheless."
FBK.11.t:0 "The Zebras turn their noses down at us"
FBK.11.d:0 "Unfortunately, the Zebras have sent a messenger telling us that they have no interest in our pact to partition the River Federation."

FBK.15.t:0 "Military Mission From Farbrook"
FBK.15.d:0 "In view of our new alliance with Hermane Gering, Farbrook has sent some of its finest military minds on a mission to our nation. This should significantly improve the quality of our officer corps."
FBK.15.a:0 "Maybe those northerners aren't so bad after all."
FBK.16.t:0 "Farbrook Demands Coldmouth Corridor"
FBK.16.d:0 "Hermane Gering's rhetoric has been getting more and more inflammatory as of late. He has been speaking for months about how the land from Coldmouth to the sea is, and always has been, hill pony land, and that all hill ponies should be in one nation. Now, an ultimatum has been delivered to us - cede this territory to Farbrook's regime or face open war."
FBK.16.a:0 "We have no choice. Surrender the land."
FBK.16.b:0 "Over my dead body!"
FBK.17.t:0 "Firtree Folds"

FBK.19.t:0 "Famine Strikes!"
FBK.19.d:0 "Unfortunately, Hempstrand's policies of forced technological regression have had entirely predictable effects. Our food production is no longer able to keep up with our population, and food is rapidly running out. Babes are wailing in hunger, mothers have nothing to give them. Riots are breaking out all over the country, and all eyes turn to Hempstrand's tent, seeking a way out of this disaster."
FBK.19.a:0 "If only we had known!"
FBK.20.t:0 "Farbrook Begs For Food"
FBK.20.d:0 "A desperate envoy arrived this morning, famished and gaunt, like a skeleton. He told us that Farbrook's leader, Hempstrand, had enacted policies of agrarianism and primtivism that had resulted in a terrible famine that will surely kill thousands of ponies if nothing is done about it. Farbrook begs us to come in and take care of them - all government has collapsed entirely, rioting is commonplace, and the strongest steal and hoard what food remains for themselves. The situation is extremely dire, and only a complete takeover is likely to prove effective at this point."
FBK.20.a:0 "This is a humanitarian disaster! Taking over their land would be, not imperialism, but mercy."
FBK.20.b:0 "Sorry, but we simply cannot afford to take on this much responsibility."
FBK.21.t:0 "Upon Deaf Ears"

FBK.hillwarriors.a:0 "Excellent news!"
FBK.22.t:0 "Farbrook institutes Unity Day"
FBK.22.d:0 "Farbrook has officially inaugurated today as Unity Day - a national holiday celebrating the greatness of each of our nations, as well as the friendship between us. This infectious celebration of civic nationalism has boosted morale slightly across the nation."
FBK.22.a:0 "If only everyone was more like them!"
FBK.23.t:0 "Farbrook secedes from the Federation"
FBK.23.d:0 "Disastrous news! The Regional Governor of Farbrook today declared his state independent of the Federation, claiming they were reclaiming their sovereignty from the 'overbearing hoof' of the River Republic. While proclaiming a desire for peaceful relations, he stated in no uncertain terms that Farbrook will decide her own future."

FBK.29.t:0 "[From.GetName] delegates desire the secret of gunpowder"
FBK.29.d:0 "The ponies of Farbrook are laughably primitive, still fighting primarily with spears and blades. They have heard of our guns, however, and now a group of their richest nobles have arrived in Rijekograd, asking to purchase the secrets to gunpowder technology. Most see this as harmless, as the Farbrookians are too few and disunited to be a threat. In addition, it would provide a slight bonus to the local economy."
FBK.29.a:0 "It'll be funny to see them marvel over our cast-off muskets and cannons!"
FBK.29.b:0 "I'm not too keen on giving the savages better weapons, even if they're friendly savages..."
FBK.30.t:0 "We Return With Firearms"
FBK.30.d:0 "Success! We have returned with weapons! Furthermore, we have learned much about the manufacture of guns and cannons - we now have access to these useful technologies!"
FBK.30.a:0 "Excellent!"
FBK.31.t:0 "Limited Success"
FBK.31.d:0 "Distressingly, the River ponies attempted to limit our ability to purchase guns from them, or to learn about them. Still, we made off with a fair few, and we have learned much about their manufacture regardless."
FBK.31.a:0 "Darn riverfolk...!"
FBK.32.t:0 "The Riverfolk assimilate"
FBK.32.d:0 "It seems that our policy of tolerance and forebearance has begun to bear fruit. Though they still fear and dislike us, some of the Riverponies have come to accept our dominance as simply the way of things, and are now focussing on trying to live their lives as best they can under our rule. Though it is small, this represents a real and substantive step toward establishing our full control over the Riverlands."

FBK.33.d:0 "The newly-installed Communist government of Farbrook has emerged from the turmoil of revolution and is now looking outwards to spread their revolution.

FBK.40.d:0 "Shocking news arrived from the North today. Chieftain Gering, in a display of vile duplicity, has broken away from the Co-Prosperity Sphere, and has declined to aid us in any further way! The Chieftain proclaims his great respect for the Sphere, but claims that it would no longer be to Farbrook's advantage to remain allied with Lake City."

FBK.41.t:0 "Gering Breaks His Oath"
FBK.41.d:0 "No explicit warning was ever given, but we have noticed it nonetheless. Over the past few months, both tribute and information from the land of Farbrook has dried up. We gave their leader, Chief Gering, substantial economic and military aid in exchange for oaths of loyalty and tribute, but now we are losing faith in his fidelity. The last set of messengers we sent to the North has not returned. We can safely assume that Gering has betrayed us, and has no intention of submitting to us."

FBK.42.t:0 "Gering Proposes Mutual Defense Pact"
FBK.42.d:0 "In a shocking turn of events, Hermane Gering recently turned on his erstwhile allies in Heavenly Snow's "Co-Prosperity Sphere" and subjugated their lands. He has now offered us guarantees of mutual non-aggression and defense, declaring no interest whatever in the conquest of further land in the East or South. Opinions are divided - on one hoof, he does occupy rightful riverpony territory, on the other, he destroyed the dangerous Heavenly Snow. What shall we do?"
FBK.42.a:0 "It would be best to ensure that no more bloodshed ensues."
FBK.42.b:0 "Gering is still a threat and will be a threat in future, no deal!"
FBK.43.t:0 "A Royal Wedding!"
FBK.43.d:0 "On this day, Princess Greta of the Griffon Empire and the Chieftain Gering of the Farbrook hillponies were united in holy matrimony. The ceremony was celebrated in a chapel in Griffenheim. The wedding was a splendid affair, financed almost entirely out of Gering's own pocket. Gering arrived wearing a surprising overcoat blending the traditional, wild styles of hillpony regalia with the grace of Imperial chic, surprising many of the locals. The northern tribespony has modernised his nation rapidly in recent years and is now the ruler of a nation that The Empire would not be ashamed to call its vassal.  Many suspect that this wedding is Gering's attempt to marry his way into the Imperial Nobility, and there are rumours that he is aiming to be dubbed a Duke. Either way, the crowd of well-wishers cheered with joy as the couple left for their honeymoon."

FBK.45.d:0 "Yesterday a very special boat arrived on our shores. Our people very nearly turned it away, but when we saw that Cenhelm, leader of our longtime friends, the ponies of Farbrook, they relented. Cenhelm has been taken straight to Queen Gytha, and now, in a private audience, he pleads with her. "Why, Gytha? You and your people used to be so joyous, so eager to make friends! Why have you become so hard-hearted?" The words of her longtime friend and ally prick Gytha's conscience. Cenhelm extends a hoof in friendship, but will Gytha believe that he is sincere?"
FBK.45.a:0 "I will listen to him, at least."
FBK.45.b:0 "Liar! He is only interested in using us!"
FBK.46.t:0 "The Power Of Friendship"
FBK.46.d:0 "As Cenhelm spoke and Gytha considered what he said, her heart started to melt, just a little. Many, indeed, perhaps most creatures could not be trusted - but had not the ponies of Farbrook proven their friendship and concern for our people over many years, and by many gifts? Eventually, she relented. She would not reject the world entirely - the ponies of Farbrook would be an exception."
FBK.46.a:0 "A friend in need is a friend indeed."
FBK.47.t:0 "Empty Words"
FBK.47.d:0 "Cenhelm spoke for many hours, but his words made no impression on Gytha's bitter heart. She could not believe that he was speaking as a friend, but only as a politician. Greneclyf has no friends, and it has no need of foreign politicians."

FBK.48.t:0 "A Heart Unfrozen - In Part"
FBK.48.d:0 "Cenhelm's great voyage is complete. While he was not able to convince Gytha to trust strangers again, he was at least able to assure her of Farbrook's good faith in these matters, and she has reopened normal communications and links with our people."
FBK.48.a:0 "That is a consolation to hear."
FBK.49.t:0 "A Heart Of Stone"

He argues that, if small nations are to remain free, they must make common cause, and thus has asked us to join with Farbrook to form a League, dedicated to the defense of Harmony in the Northern lands."

He pleaded with exceptional vigor, explaining that he had led a long life of dissolution, and that only the prospect of fighting and dying for something bigger than himself kept him going. If we denied him, he said, he would likely fall back into the demon drink, and end ignobly in a gutter somewhere.

FBK.65.a:0 "Excellent."
FBK.66.t:0 "Request Declined!"
FBK.66.d:0 "Unfortunately, the Griffonian Empire has declined to send us weaponry as we desires. They claim to be lacking in spares."
FBK.66.a:0 "Suppose we'll have to make our own."

NEvillages.1.t:0 "People Rally Behind The Army"
NEvillages.1.d:0 "The extremely high level of respect that our society holds for the military has spilled over into civilian life. The army is seen as glorious, and songs are commonly sung extolling the virtues of legendary warriors of times past. This wave of patriotic fervour has riled our people up, and they are slowly becoming more hawkish and willing to go to war."
NEvillages.1.a:0 "Rah, Rah, Rah!"
NEvillages.2.t:0 "Sign Up Today!"
NEvillages.2.d:0 "The recent upswelling of patriotic fervour has convinced many young stallions to abandon their idle ways and their civilian lives to enlist in the military. This surplus of talent could be put straight into the frontline, or we could send them to less exciting, but equally necessary, jobs in the administration of our armed forces."
NEvillages.2.a:0 "Every able-bodied stallion will do his duty!"
NEvillages.2.b:0 "Paper-pushing may not be glorious, but it is necessary."
NEvillages.3.t:0 "Complacency In The Army"
NEvillages.3.d:0 "Our armed forces have an enormous amount of influence and respect in our nation - and this has rather gone to their heads. They have gotten sloppy in their practice drills, safe in the knowledge that the public will back them against anyone who might try to assail their comfortable position. Already signs of flab are starting to show, as our officers and soldiers are taking things a little bit too easy."
NEvillages.3.a:0 "This will blow over eventually."
NEvillages.3.b:0 "Whip them back into shape, now!"
NEvillages.4.t:0 "Nopony Wants To Enlist"
NEvillages.4.d:0 "The army is currently a highly disreputable profession, and recruitment numbers are at an all time low. Because of this, we are finding a large number of stallions who would otherwise probably have applied for military jobs, but who now find themselves unable to find a proper place in society."
NEvillages.4.a:0 "They would make good clerks!"
NEvillages.4.b:0 "Offer them extra money - we could use some better command staff."
NEvillages.5.t:0 "Soldiers Retire"
NEvillages.5.d:0 "Given the low pay and lack of respect that our soldiers receive, it is no wonder that few want to continue in this job. Many of our soldiers are simply leaving the army and returning to civilian life. Many of them do not even wait to be discharged, and our weakened and apathetic military bureaucracy is unable to stop them."
NEvillages.5.a:0 "I'm sure we didn't need them anyway"
NEvillages.6.t:0 "Officers Retire"
NEvillages.6.d:0 "Given the low pay and lack of respect that even our higher-ranking soldiers receive, it is no wonder that few want to continue in this job. Many of our soldiers are simply leaving the army and returning to civilian life. Many of them do not even wait to be discharged, and our weakened and apathetic military bureaucracy is unable to stop them."
NEvillages.6.a:0 "I'm sure we didn't need them anyway"
NEvillages.7.t:0 "Army Informs On Political Opponents"
NEvillages.7.d:0 "Some of our contacts within the military have informed us of secrets and rumours picked up about our political opponents. While it's impossible to be completely sure about the veracity of such rumours, the knowledge that the army is fiercely loyal to us and will relay any indiscreet remarks it hears is sure to make our opponents less willing to speak out against us."
NEvillages.7.a:0 "Tell me more..."
NEvillages.8.t:0 "People Feel Safe"
NEvillages.8.d:0 "Our army is loyal, disciplined, and restrained, with very little in the way of disorderly conduct or rowdiness. Every indiscretion and crime committed by soldiers is vigorously and promptly punished in a way that the people can publically see. This has led the people to feel more safe and secure in their homes at night."
NEvillages.8.a:0 "A Safe People Is A Happy People."
NEvillages.9.t:0 "People Don't Feel Safe"
NEvillages.9.d:0 "Our army is a hotbed of strife and dissent, often refusing to cooperate with civil authorities. Many times, the prosecution of soldiers for crimes committed against the civilian populace are stalled or ignored by the military courts, leading people to mistrust the army. Unsurprisingly, this has made our political situation that much more tense."
NEvillages.9.a:0 "Something has to be done about this..."
NEvillages.10.t:0 "Army Leaks Secrets To Our Political Rivals"
NEvillages.10.d:0 "Disaster! A high-ranking general has leaked important secrets to our political enemies! The consequences of this scandal could take months to clear up, and it is clear that the army has no loyalty towards our government whatsoever..."
NEvillages.10.a:0 "Traitorous Dogs!"
NEvillages.11.t:0 "The Army Makes Its Move"
NEvillages.11.d:0 "For months now, there have been rumours of dissent within the army, and now things have finally come to a head. Calling upon their loyal soldiers and counting upon the strong support of the people of [Root.GetName], the generals have executed a coup, to remove the current leadership from power and consolidate control in their own hooves. Divisions are mustering throughout the country - this is unlikely to end peacefully..."
NEvillages.11.a:0 "The Generals Know What Is Best!"
NEvillages.11.b:0 "Those traitors will hang!"
NEvillages.12.t:0 "Farmers protest modernisation"
NEvillages.12.d:0 "Most of our population are farmers, and so when they complain, it is advisable to listen. Right now, they are dissatisfied with the agricultural reforms that we are trying to push onto our nation. They claim that these new ways of doing things are expensive, do more harm than good, and are not needed in the first place, since they were doing perfectly fine without them."
NEvillages.12.a:0 "We will press ahead regardless."
NEvillages.12.b:0 "We should halt our modernisation efforts for now."
NEvillages.12.c:0 "Send the Army in to take care of them!"
NEvillages.13.t:0 "Army protests Modernisation"
NEvillages.13.d:0 "Many members of our military have come out to publicly criticise [Root.GetLeader]'s policies of reform, arguing that they are a break with the traditions of our ancestors, cause strife and division between the people, and cause confusion in the army, as we are unfamiliar with these foreign ways of army organisation. While the situation is not yet at crisis point, it is worrying that anyone in the military would dare to say such a thing out loud, and more worrying that their superiors have not shut them up."
NEvillages.13.a:0 "The Army serves us, we do not serve them."
NEvillages.13.b:0 "We should halt our modernisation efforts for now."
NEvillages.13.c:0 "Root out those traitors! I don't care what it takes!"
NEvillages.14.t:0 "Landowners protest Modernisation"
NEvillages.14.d:0 "Many of our richest and most influential polticians are powerful landowners, who are highly wary of change, and have often been disadvantaged by the reforms we are attempting to implement. Many of them have come forward to criticise our government's handling of the situation, and calling for an end to this madness and a return to the old order."
NEvillages.14.a:0 "The rich have ever been the enemies of progress."
NEvillages.14.b:0 "We should halt our modernisation efforts for now."
NEvillages.15.t:0 "Politburo protests Modernisation"
NEvillages.15.d:0 "While the Revolution has mostly been successful, it has also necessitated the creation of an entrenched beauraucracy, resistant to change. Many of them have come forward to criticise our government's industrialisation policy, and calling for the reform to be handled in a more reserved and cautious manner."
NEvillages.15.a:0 "Damned Revisionists!"
NEvillages.15.b:0 "We should halt our modernisation efforts for now."
NEvillages.16.t:0 "Farmers strongly protest modernisation"
NEvillages.16.d:0 ""They're destroying our way of life, and they don't even care!" comes the cry from the rabble-rouser. Around him crowds a throng of peasant farmers, cheering him on. It seems the rampant changes that we have wrought in our country to bring it up to speed with the modern world have not been appreciated among the farmers. This movement could spiral dangerously out of control if we are not careful..."
NEvillages.16.a:0 "They'll forget about it eventually."
NEvillages.16.b:0 "Maybe we should ease up a little."
NEvillages.17.t:0 "Army strongly protests modernisation"
NEvillages.17.d:0 "Our armed forces are very unhappy with the way that we've handled our modernisation program. The changes have made a lot of powerful people uncomfortable, and there is widespread talk of dissent, even mutiny in some corners. Soldiers of both high and low rank speak out against our reforms, and nobody tries to stop them. It seems we may have a mutiny on our hooves if we can't stabilise the situation soon..."
NEvillages.17.a:0 "Let them groan, the reforms will go ahead."
NEvillages.17.b:0 "Order the reforms temporarily frozen."
NEvillages.17.c:0 "Root out those traitors! I don't care what it takes!"
NEvillages.18.t:0 "Landowners strongly protest modernisation"
NEvillages.18.d:0 "Recently, a major landowner, in protest of the widespread reforms sweeping the nation, rallied his serfs and tenant workers to march in the streets of many of our major towns and cities. The effects of the March have been striking, with ponies coming out of their houses in droves to support the marchers, swelling their numbers enormously. It seems our reforms are even less popular than we had thought."
NEvillages.18.a:0 "Damn them! The reforms go ahead!"
NEvillages.18.b:0 "We should stop the reforms temporarily until the situation calms down."
NEvillages.19.t:0 "Politburo Strongly Rejects Reforms"
NEvillages.19.d:0 ""These so-called reforms are not only ill-timed and poorly-managed, they are in fact contradictory to the spirit of socialism as propagated by Steel Stallion. I must condemn their implementation in the strongest possible terms, and call upon the People to unite to reject these damaging and detrimental reforms, before they further imperil the growth of socialism in our country." So reads an anonymous letter circulated throughout the country, widely thought to be written by a high-ranking member of our Politburo. This is reaching a crisis point - the people are angry, and this show of support from the highest reaches of state is emboldening them. We may fall into anarchy if nothing is done..."
NEvillages.19.a:0 "Damn the Politburo! Progress cannot be stopped!"
NEvillages.19.b:0 "We must not endanger the Revolution. Slow down reform."
NEvillages.20.t:0 "Anti-Machine Terrorism"
NEvillages.20.d:0 "The recent modernisation attempts have proven extremely unpopular, and the government has proven disastrously incapable of dealing with the unrest. Gangs of dispossessed or disaffected ponies are now gathering for the express purpose of smashing and destroying as many factories and advanced machines as they can. These group have come to be called the 'Cogglers' after Bronze Cog, a stallion who was publically arrested and sentenced to years in prison for smashing a vital piece of factory equipment. The army has been sent to deal with them, but so far their efforts have been token, and turned up nothing. The Cogglers are extremely popular, especially among the rural population, and many in the Army sympathise with them. It will be very difficult to put an end to this group..."
NEvillages.20.a:0 "The situation must be restabilised"
NEvillages.21.t:0 "The Agrarian Revolt"
NEvillages.21.d:0 "The ponies of [Root.GetName] have finally had enough. Opposition to the government's attempts at modernisation has grown more and more intense in the recent weeks, and now it has reached a head. Armed militia are forming, army units are defecting to join their cause, and chieftains and landowners across the country are denouncing the government as illegitimate. At this point, it seems clear that the only way to avoid bloodshed is to completely resign, allowing the nascent opposition, centered around a council of traditionalist chieftains, to take the reins of power."
NEvillages.21.a:0 "We must avoid bloodshed. Let the damned Chieftains try to fix the country, if they can."
NEvillages.21.b:0 "We will never surrender to terrorists!"

GeringDrunkDesc:0 "In the months since his deposition from power, ex-Chieftain Gering has let himself go to the dogs. An incredibly ambitious stallion, he simply could not tolerate a life of obscurity, and turned to alcohol and more exotic substances from the south to assuage his pain. As time passed, he became fat and bloated from his abuse of these strange substances, and yesterday he was found lying in a gutter in Farbrook City, dead. It seems that he had overdosed. He was buried in a small, quiet grave, unmarked except for his own name."

GeringHLQTitle:0 "Something To Die For"
GeringHLQDesc:0 "In the time since being deposed from power, Hermane Gering has been thinking. For many weeks he turned to drinking to drown his sorrows, but recently he has turned himself around. Once, it seemed he would destroy himself with drink, but now he has been sober for two weeks, and has been seen in the public square speaking boldly about the danger from the North, as well as extolling the martial virtues. He seems to have found a new purpose in life - he will go north, and join the Arcturian Order, to give his life in the defense of all life against the ravenous dead. As he packs up his spear and heads off into the gloom, we cannot but wonder if all of this was meant to happen from the beginning..."

GeringZebricaDesc:0 "In the weeks since being deposed from power, Hermane Gering has fallen hard. He started to drink excessively, and was regularly found drunk and knocked out beneath bar tables,as well as frittering away all of his money. It seemed he was destined to drink himself to death, but something saved him from this sordid fate. One night, he came across a crew of strange-looking sailors from out of town. They were docking in Farbrook, and ended up getting into a fight with Gering. He knocked two of them out before being clonked in the head with a broken bottle, and his ferocity impressed them so much that they decided to recruit him. The gang revealed themselves to be pirates, from the far land of Zebrica. Lacking a purpose and desiring good rum, Gering was eventually convinced to join their crew, and now he has set sail for the far shores of Zebrica."

He would traipse around the town, shrieking at dogs and scaring small children, earning the scorn of some and the pity of more. However, we would never have expected him to hijack the plane of a visiting dignitary and fly it straight out of the country! What's stranger, he is not flying erratically - he goes in one direction, as if he knows where he's going...but where on earth could that be?"

She has finally had enough, and has despaired of socialism ever taking root in her homeland.

It was during one of her nightly drinking sessions that the strange griffon sidled into the bar. Applethorn was inebriated enough that she didn't really notice him sidling over to her, and before she realised it, an ice-pick had been buried in the back of her head. The assassin was later captured and tried, but it was too late. Applethorn, hero of the Communist movement, was dead. It was later revealed that the assassin had been hired by royalist elements from Brodfeld, seeking revenge on her for her part in fighting during the Communist uprising against the King."

But in the present, it it playing host to the 1st Congress of the Trade Unions, which will determine the course of Las Peagsus for years to come. \n\nWith Starry Plough already losing ground to the Social Democrat, Sugar Sprinkle, there is also a question of power to be settled in the city. Right now, however, no one knows who will emerge the winner of the Congress. It might be the Father of the revolution, or it might be the Daughter of Reform. In any case, it will all be settled here."
 lsp.54.a:0 "Welcome to the Congress. Reactionaries not welcome."
 lsp.55.t:0 "The Military Matter"
 lsp.55.d:0 "Today, the primary matter up for discussion was the matter of the military. Sugar Sprinkle and her faction in particular has led a charge for a professional military, centralized under the government in Las Pegasus, which immediately gave cause to cries of “Traitor” and “Reactionary” from the hall as she spoke passionately for a military to defend the nation, that worked around the clock, as opposed to what she called “Part-timers”, all part of her Wellness Plan.\n\n On the other hoof, Starry Plough talked in favor of keeping the loose militia structure that had served the revolution well during those young, chaotic days, and that we must avoid a military that grows permanent, lest it gets ideas about being in power themselves, as part of his alternate Pegasus Plan\n\nStill, the room is sharply divided with the two camps in each end of the hall. The votes are counted, one after one, after one. And the result is..."
 lsp.55.a:0 "The supporters of the Pegasus Plan have it!"
 lsp.55.b:0 "The supporters of the Wellness Plan have it!"
 lsp.56.t:0 "The Economic Debate"
 lsp.56.d:0 "The primary discussion tabled for today was the structure of the future economy, or rather, the question of how interconnected it should be with the world. Once more, Sugar Sprinkle and Starry Plough could be found in the Great Hall at opposing lecterns dueling each other with words. Their argument by this point has largely boiled down. Starry Plough has been vexing on about how the civil war has shown that a war could break out at any time, and that therefore, we must be ready if another war comes for a total breakdown in trade.\n\nRunning contrary to him, Sugar Sprinkle has denounced it as being foolish and that trying to strive for this will end up with the workers living in worse squalor than before. Additionally, she is pointing out that we have already interacted with other nations diplomatically and that the Baltimare Republic in particular played a part in that."
 lsp.56.a:0 "The listeners support Starry Plough!"
 lsp.56.b:0 "The listeners rally to Sugar Sprinkle!"

 LSP_the_illegitimate_republic_desc:0 "We are a spit of rock in the middle of a churning sea of chaos. A burning wreck. The police is swarmed by looters and criminals. The government cannot keep up with the paperwork. The infrastructure cannot support independence. The border guards watch Equestrian rangers uneasily over the fence. Something must be done. Mayor Rokenhar must put his hoof down."
 LSP_promote_defeatism:0 "Equestria Is Doomed"
 LSP_promote_defeatism_desc:0 "Cleaved in half by a deadly civil war, the rest of Equestria will not stand for long. Even if the conflict will not sprawl into the next decade like most civil wars tend to do, the victorious side will stand upon nothing but a pile of ashes. Weakened, Equestria will fall prey to its neighbours - the Changelings and the communists. We did the right thing to leave when we did."
 LSP_denounce_horror_of_war:0 "The Horrors of War"
 LSP_denounce_horror_of_war_desc:0 "The Equestrian army is running out of ponies to send to the meat-grinder. Conscription has just been approved by the monarchy, and disturbing images of officers lining up fresh recruits forced into their uniforms has filled this week’s news. Let the ponies of Las Pegasus know that if we go back, their future will be one as a conscripted soldier on the receiving end of front-line fire."
 LSP_scaremonger_over_economy:0 "The Impending Crash"
 LSP_scaremonger_over_economy_desc:0 "Grim reports come from the Equestrian stock exchange in Canterlot. Economists predict sharp decreases in the kingdom’s economy, with most of their working-age ponies conscripted and with Nightmare Moon’s legions ravaging their country. Las Pegasus, on the other hand, is currently undergoing a period of stable growth as citizens are gaining trust in the nation."
 LSP_condemn_tyranny:0 "The Condemnation of Tyranny"
 LSP_condemn_tyranny_desc:0 "There’s already rumours that secret police patrols the streets of Canterlot. That conversations all over Equestria are wiretapped. All suspected Nightmare Moon supporters have been secretly arrested.. It was expected that, with war knocking on the capital’s door, Equestria would grow more tyrannical, but never so suddenly. We must denounce the new fascist elements in government."
 LSP_all_enemies_outwitted:0 "Checkmate"
 LSP_all_enemies_outwitted_desc:0 "The mugshots of arrested communist radicals are proudly on display in our police stations. The remnants of the monarchists are barely scrounging up money for their headquarters’ electricity bills. The PCA only has a handful of disgraced members left. In the perfumed silence of Mayor Rokenhar’s office, he opens a bottle of champagne, to celebrate a Great Game fairly won."
 LSP_flirt_left:0 "A Leftwards Wink"
 LSP_flirt_left_desc:0 "There exist factions vying for control in Las Pegasus’ shadows. Communist firebrands of the revolution, monarchist high society, radical puritans dabbling with fascism. Mayor Rokenhar plans to play puppet-master to destroy the opposition in its infancy. And rather than get his hands dirty, he can simply get them to fight each other. The disorganized communists will be easy to manipulate..."
 LSP_anti_monarchism:0 "A Blow to the Crown"
 LSP_anti_monarchism_desc:0 "Left-leaning, red-clad communist firebrands all over the city gather on their soap boxes to chant for the downfall of the bourgeois, declare that Las Pegasus will never see royalty on any throne. Where did they get those megaphones? Their shiny brass buttoned suits? Their polished boots? Mayor Rokenhar grins seeing the approval rating of the monarchist party slowly decline..."
 LSP_secretly_fund_agitators:0 "A Leftwards Nudge"
 LSP_secretly_fund_agitators_desc:0 "Materials for their work, secretly delivered to the city’s communists; a red suitcase full of monarchist supporters’ names; a crate of small-arms; several letters of cold cash. All of the pieces of a satisfying puzzle… now, lean back and see it solve itself; hope that no word of it gets out - that’d be a spanner thrown right into the works."
 LSP_anti_fascism:0 "The Fascist Downfall"
 LSP_anti_fascism_desc:0 "On the alleys frequented by PCA speakers, communist agitators begin to set their soapboxes. At every far-right rally, there’s always a far-left counter-protest. Every fascist hate-crime is met with an equally brutal communist counter-attack, the police never batting an eye. The PCA slowly loses favour, as claimed by the latest polls. The plan is going exactly as intended."
 LSP_secretly_arm_workers:0 "Weapons for the Working People"
 LSP_secretly_arm_workers_desc:0 "Caches of combat knives, batons, concealable pistols and instructions for the creation of pipe-bombs and other explosive devices have been hidden throughout the city at different locations. Coded letters and ciphers describing their exact locations have been mailed to the leaders of the reds. Within mere days, PCA and monarchist speakers have learned to steer clear of known communist hot-spots."
 LSP_expose_abuse_of_workers:0 "More Fuel for the Fire"
 LSP_expose_abuse_of_workers_desc:0 "Secret footage of worker mistreatment captured in numerous high-profile companies and factories has been declassified. Rolls of film containing scenes of abuse ranging from unsanitary conditions to workplace mutilation and documents describing the poor pay and treatment of factory workers have been secretly given to the reds. The scenes depicted have already begun appearing in communist propaganda films."
 LSP_leak_army_plans:0 "Leak the Militia’s Plans"
 LSP_leak_army_plans_desc:0 "The PCA possesses a militia force comprised largely of far-right radical volunteers. They wield bats, knives and pitchforks, and frequently patrol the alleys of the city, leaving battered, bruised and occasionally dead communist sympathizers in their wake. The police has managed to compile a comprehensive chart of their patrol routes, and we shall see that it falls in the hands of the reds, to help them avoid confrontation."
 LSP_release_starry_plough_from_prison:0 "Starry Plough’s Release "
 LSP_release_starry_plough_from_prison_desc:0 "Starry Plough, the “Firebrand of the Revolution”, after being incarcerated at the onset of independence, has been granted a full pardon by Mayor Rokenhar. Prison wardens were instructed to release him from Forhorn Prison at midnight. Red attacks on fascist and monarchist rallies are expected to grow tenfold. Soon, tensions will reach a breaking point in Las Pegasus."
 LSP_flirt_right:0 "Dabbling with the PCA"
 LSP_flirt_right_desc:0 "There exist factions vying for control in Las Pegasus’ shadows. Communist firebrands of the revolution, monarchist high society, radical puritans embracing fascism. Mayor Rokenhar plans to play puppet-master, to destroy the opposition in its infancy. Rather than get his hands dirty, he can simply get them to fight each other. The PCA is infamous for its extreme views - a perfect puppet."
 LSP_anti_communism:0 "Red Scare"
 LSP_anti_communism_desc:0 "Hospitals city-wide are reporting cases of communist speakers arriving with wounds after beatings by gangs of PCA supporters wielding a wide array of contraband weaponry (wink.). The police, however, has been instructed to remain silent. With red speakers growing wary of fascist lynching, communist popularity is fading. Let us hope word of our involvement doesn’t get out."
 LSP_monarchist_communist_connection:0 "Pine Chest’s Conspiracy"
 LSP_monarchist_communist_connection_desc:0 "The leader of the PCA is the target of moderate critique due to his insane theories and conspiracies. Of course they are nothing but the tirades of a madman, but creating false evidence for some of them could help us in the long term. The ones claiming Celestia a communist sympathiser for her reluctance to crush Stalliongrad could become a heavy blow to both reds and monarchists."
 LSP_fatcats_news_monopoly:0 "Allies in the News"
 LSP_fatcats_news_monopoly_desc:0 "Many wealthy news labels reside within Las Pegasus, and the people benefit from a wide variety of different papers. For a sum of money, many of the owners of the newspapers would have no problem with altering the truth ever so slightly, to make sure support for Mayor Rokenhar’s regime rises and sympathy for Equestria lowers."
 LSP_military_parade:0 "Allow the PCA to Rally"
 LSP_military_parade_desc:0 "Ever since their party rose to power, fascist sympathizers within the PCA have been itching to hold an organized march through the city as a show of force, to prove their better, more robust command structure compared to the communists. Allowing them to hold a rally will more than likely greatly impact red morale."
 LSP_expanded_police_powers:0 "Strengthening Our Position"
 LSP_expanded_police_powers_desc:0 "The ink on Las Pegasus’ constitution is still wet, and with the situation currently so chaotic, there’s nothing stopping us from expanding the powers of our most loyal asset - the Metropolitan Police Force. A few extra privileges, rights and capabilities can go a long way in securing Mayor Rokenhar’s position, and also in bringing order to Las Pegasus."
 LSP_leak_location_of_cells:0 "Gentle Encouragement"
 LSP_leak_location_of_cells_desc:0 "Communists throughout the city, in the wake of harsh battles fought in Las Pegasus’ darker corners, have converted several abandoned warehouses into makeshift prisons for captured PCA fighters. Unbeknownst to them, the mayor has agents and informants everywhere. Leaking the locations of these prisons to the PCA could further encouragement raids and violence."
 LSP_pass_strikebreaking_law:0 "Ban Worker Strikes"
 LSP_pass_strikebreaking_law_desc:0 "In spite of all of their armaments and fiery passion, the communists’ biggest weapon against Las Pegasus were strikes. Industry has ground to a standstill, and the factory overseers and PCA economists are furious. Fortunately for them, a quick footnote added to the lawbook is all we must do to ensure a strikeless future. This will not only weaken the reds, but secure support from the industrial big-leagues."
 LSP_paramilitary_brigades:0 "The Blackhooves"
 LSP_paramilitary_brigades_desc:0 "Pine Chest has been rambling for the better part of Las Pegasus' existence about the strength of his elite forces in Waffleland. His only problem was the government holding him back from establishing his long-desired paramilitary. Until now. With a subtle nod from Mayor Rokenhar, the PCA will get the go-ahead to ship in a trainful of elite soldiers for their new militia. The Blackhooves."
 LSP_battle_on_the_big_boulevard:0 "The Battle on the Big Boulevard"
 LSP_battle_on_the_big_boulevard_desc:0 "With loyalist agents well-rooted in the political activities of our enemies and with the communists and PCA having grown bloated with the support we’ve secretly offered, tensions in Las Pegasus are reaching a boiling point. Though confrontation seems inevitable, Mayor Rokenhar has ordered the police to stand down. Loyalist blood will not be shed in the battle - our enemies shall kill each other."
 LSP_lift_ban_on_public_meetings:0 "Lift The Ban on Public Meetings"
 LSP_lift_ban_on_public_meetings_desc:0 "With the constant threat of yet another city-burning riot, the government outlawed the practice of public meetings comprised of more than three people sometime ago.

 LSP_poke_east:0 "Storm the Fields"

 LSP_more_planning_and_digin:0 "Fortify the City"
 LSP_more_planning_and_digin_desc:0 "We don’t have the numbers to withstand Celestia’s hordes, but a few minefields and a couple of pillboxes can give us a crucial edge."

 LSP_forced_labor_research_and_prod_desc:0 "Some of the communists we captured were leading professors from the University Campus of Los Pegasus.

No monarchists begging for a crown. No gunshots as the police fights looters and loose criminals. No chaos, no more. Peace, at last, has come to Las Pegasus. Mayor Rokenhar has won."
 LSP_fire_ball_and_chain:0 "Fire Ball and Chain"
 LSP_fire_ball_and_chain_desc:0 "Alright, no more dawdling - now that we’ve brought some semblance of stability to the country, it’s time we begun picking up the pieces. Our bureaucracy is, to say the least, bloated and inefficient. We’ve some pruning to do, put old politicians out to pasture, recalibrate the entire government to suit independence. And get rid of that damned Ball and Chain."
 LSP_address_the_food_issue:0 "The Food Issue"
 LSP_address_the_food_issue_desc:0 "One of the biggest issues of our independence is self-sustainability. We are a very populous nation in relation to the amount of arable land at our disposal. We didn’t have time to stockpile food before we seceded, and with all commerce having to pass through Equestria… we need to find a solution before Las Pegasus starves to death."
 LSP_establish_trade_relations:0 "Trade Relations"
 LSP_establish_trade_relations_desc:0 "This should take out two birds with one stone - by establishing trade relations with other nations, we also place Las Pegasus on the world stage as a sovereign state. Emissaries were sent all over the continent - Olenia, the Changelings, the Yaks, Stalliongrad and even Equestria - though we don’t know how much to expect from them."
 LSP_encourage_farming_in_waffleland:0 "Encourage Farming"
 LSP_encourage_farming_in_waffleland_desc:0 "Waffleland is not nearly as urbanized as Las Pegasus to the north, and that may be exactly what we need to combat the issue of food. Constructing irrigation systems and encouraging agriculture in the region will relieve a huge strain off of the country’s food intake."
 LSP_ask_for_charity:0 "Asking for Help"
 LSP_ask_for_charity_desc:0 "However humiliating it may be, Las Pegasus cannot survive without the help of its neighbours. With rations growing more and more meagre by the day, and with the hungry populace starting to look across the border fence to the giant Equestrian food stores, it’s time we sent out emissaries requesting help."
 LSP_high_yield_crops:0 "No More Grapes"
 LSP_high_yield_crops_desc:0 "To survive the food crisis, we must make the best out of our situation, by maximizing the amount of efficiency extracted from our limited soil. Areas like viticulture, fruticulture and pasturing are not at all efficient in relation to the amount of space they take up, so we must refocus on planting high-yield plants like grain and maize."
 LSP_safe_from_famine:0 "Safe From Famine"
 LSP_safe_from_famine_desc:0 "All our efforts are finally paying off. Food yield is in the green - we’re producing more than we’re consuming. Granted, only barely more than we’re consuming, but as time goes on, yield will slowly rise. Yet another crisis has been averted, and for the first time in a long time, ponies of Las Pegasus can enjoy full, unrationed meals."
 LSP_restore_order:0 "The Restoration of Order"
 LSP_restore_order_desc:0 "Enough mucking about. With the political situation stabilized and the food issue sorted out, it’s time Mayor Rokenhar put his hoof down. We’ve braved the worst of the storm, and we’re finally ready to reap the rewards of our determination. Rejoining Equestria is an idea of the past. Las Pegasus can finally stand on its own legs. Order, at last."
 LSP_seize_assets:0 "Punish the Opportunists"
 LSP_seize_assets_desc:0 "In the chaos of secession, several corporations believed the government would collapse and, therefore, they instead decided to support more radical opposition fronts. It’s about time we got back at them, and made sure to establish a loyal industrial base. This can also be a great opportunity to seize the assets of some… unsavory ponies, such as Pine Chest."
 LSP_clean_up_harmonists:0 "Deal with the Harmonists"
 LSP_clean_up_harmonists_desc:0 "With the thoughts of reunification having left the minds of most citizens, we can finally pinpoint our efforts on stomping out any last, stubborn anti-independence movement. Offer amnesty to those who agree to stand down, and prepare the court for treason charges against those who remain adamantly pro-Equestrian."
 LSP_increased_police_presence:0 "Call the National Guard"
 LSP_increased_police_presence_desc:0 "A cursory look at the streets of Las Pegasus is enough to show that crime is not dying down at pace we had hoped for. The police department is still struggling to cope with the wave of criminals from the days of anarchy, so we must call for backup, in the form of the National Guard, until criminal activities lower."
 LSP_the_mayors_las_pegasus:0 "The Mayor’s Las Pegasus"
 LSP_the_mayors_las_pegasus_desc:0 "The last anarchic cells have surrendered. Protests are finally a rarity. The value of the currency is rising, and the amount of “down with the government!” graffiti has declined drastically. Every pressing issue that plagued the city at the onset of independence has been dealt with, and finally, Mayor Rokenhar can have a breath of peace."
 LSP_military_rebuilding:0 "Reorganizing the Army"
 LSP_military_rebuilding_desc:0 "It’s about time we looked at our armed forces. The army has been largely neglected. It was always a “we’ll fix it later” issue - but later is now, and Las Pegasus can wait no longer. We are threatened by Equestria on the daily, and it’s about time we established a proper, professional army for our defense."
 LSP_destroy_CLA_influence:0 "Integrate the Communists"
 LSP_destroy_CLA_influence_desc:0 "Though they tried to destroy our government, the CLA is still a political party in our government, and it’d be tyrannical to end them. So, if you can’t beat them, make them join you. By enrolling the reds, we’ll be making sure they remain under our constant supervision. And, if there’s ever a war, at least they’ll be the ones to die first." 
 LSP_destroy_PCA_influence:0 "Integrate the Fascists"
 LSP_destroy_PCA_influence_desc:0 "Though they tried to destroy our government, the PCA is still a political party in our government, and it’d be tyrannical to end them. So, if you can’t beat them, make them join you. By enrolling the fascists, we’ll be making sure they remain under our constant supervision. And, if there’s ever a war, at least they’ll be the ones to die first."
 LSP_expand_national_guard:0 "Expand the National Guard"
 LSP_expand_national_guard_desc:0 "As the needs of our police force rise steadily with our growing prosperity and our growing criminal underworld, the National Guard has made multiple requests for extra personnel. It’s about time we answered those requests and offered our boys some well-deserved help."
 LSP_restore_officer_corp:0 "Restore the Officer Corps"
 LSP_restore_officer_corp_desc:0 "Even after the political chaos that plagued Las Pegasus for so long, there's still a multitude of skilled officers ready to offer their services. A few extra medals and some adequately-oversized cigars later, they almost look the part."
 LSP_the_army_of_las_pegasus:0 "The New Army"
 LSP_the_army_of_las_pegasus_desc:0 "Soldiers, check. Guns, check. Generals, check. A lack of inner strife, check-check. We have all the ingredients to begin proper work on our armed forces. As the sun sets over Equestria, in the bronze light of dusk, the new army of Las Pegasus stands strong, proud, and ready to serve."
 LSP_global_las_pegasus:0 "Global Las Pegasus"
LSP_global_las_pegasus_desc:0 "We’ve already established formal relations with other nations through our earlier trade agreements back during the famine, but it’s about time we’ve stepped up our game. It’s time to push Las Pegasus out onto the world stage, in all its revitalized, rebuilt glory."
 LSP_collaborate_SCS:0 "Collaborate with the South"
LSP_collaborate_SCS_desc:0 "The Southern Confederate States are in a pickle much like ours - whereas we were the ones to abandon the Canterlot government, they were abandoned by said government, therefore they seceded. As two nations born of the same bloated empire, we are sisters of the south, and we should work to improve relations and establish an alliance. "
LSP_encourage_southern_migration:0 "Encourage Southern Migration"
LSP_encourage_southern_migration_desc:0 "We have all that the south needs, and the south has all that we need - we have a thriving economy and infrastructure, they have the population to supply them. Encouraging migration into Waffleland would provide jobs for southerners, and extra ponypower for Las Pegasus."
LSP_southern_army_influence:0 "Southern Military Training"
LSP_southern_army_influence_desc:0 "The south has seen confrontation with Equestria far more fierce than we have. They have experience which Las Pegasus deeply lacks and knowledge of modern warfare that we need if we don’t want to fall behind militarily-speaking. We should work to learn from them, to incorporate some southern tactics into the Las Pegasus army."
LSP_mutual_resources:0 "Resource-Sharing"
LSP_mutual_resources_desc:0 “Both of our nations have something that the other craves - the south has its vast fields of black gold, and Las Pegasus has its mighty working steel mills. Offering some of our resources to the other would be a great way to further intertwine our economies, and to greatly improve relations."
LSP_the_desert_rangers:0 "The Desert Rangers"
LSP_the_desert_rangers_desc:0 “The southern gunslinger rangers are renowned for their battle-prowess and fierceness. Convincing the S.C.S. to offer us a few battalions would be a great boost for Las Pegasus’ army.”
LSP_second_republic_of_the_greater_confederation:0 "The Second Republic"
LSP_second_republic_of_the_greater_confederation_desc:0 "After such strides towards friendship, mutual understanding, and military assistance, it’s about time we’ve established even closer relations with the S.C.S., by declaring Las Pegasus to the be the first addition to the Confederation. We will remain sovereign, but we will be closer politically, economically and militarily than ever."
 LSP_staunch_defiance:0 "Staunchly defiant"
LSP_staunch_defiance_desc:0 "Las Pegasus doesn’t need allies - all of our strength, our might, we’ve acquired facing all hardships alone. We are ready to finally stand on our own hooves, separate from any other power, ruled by a single will, governed by a single destiny. Las Pegasus stands alone, determined and ready. A rock of stability in a sea of chaos."
LSP_defensive_mindset:0 "A defensive mindset"
LSP_defensive_mindset_desc:0 "Las Pegasus, though strong, is dwarfed in size and population by its neighbours. We simply do not have the raw manpower and resources needed to wage offensive warfare. Therefore, we will let our enemies come to us. Dig in. Prepare. Fight. And win. Let their blood fertilize our fields."
LSP_the_lsp_rangers:0 "The Las Pegasus Rangers"
LSP_the_lsp_rangers_desc:0 "Some officers of the National Guard and other facets of the military have shown a kind of ferocity, combat-excellence and superiority on the field that could match even Equestria’s famed rangers. It’s about time we established our own Ranger Corps. "
LSP_creep_north:0 "Creep north"
LSP_creep_north_desc:0 "Las Pegasus needs room to breathe. Though we arguably have room southwards into Waffleland, the city hugs the northern border uneasily. It’s about time we stretched out a little."
LSP_creep_south:0 "Creep south"
LSP_creep_south_desc:0 "Much of Waffleland is dominated by agriculture to fuel the main city, but even now, the food situation is unsteady at best. The lands south are vast and fertile, and could provide great opportunities for more food."
LSP_consolidate_our_grip:0 "Consolidate our grip"
LSP_consolidate_our_grip_desc:0 "It’s time to hang up the hatchet. We’ve carved the territory we need out of our neighbours, now the question is all about integrating it into Las Pegasus proper."
 LSP_collaborate_EQS:0 "Collaborate with Equestria"
LSP_collaborate_EQS_desc:0 "We’ve had our ups and downs, yes, but Equestria is still our largest and arguably strongest neighbour. Perhaps it would be wisest for us to take back some of the less savory accusations we’ve made on the onset of independence and try to repair our relationship, ask for an alliance, and pray that they don’t bomb the hell out of us."
LSP_equestrian_science_is_the_greatest_in_the_world:0 "Equestrian Science Collaboration"
LSP_equestrian_science_is_the_greatest_in_the_world_desc:0 "While Las Pegasus is quite advanced, it still doesn’t hold a candle to Equestria’s sprawling research infrastructure. Patching into that network of universities, laboratories and research centers would boost the country’s scientific base significantly."
LSP_normalise_immigration:0 "Normalise Immigration"
LSP_normalise_immigration_desc:0 "The enormous border fence between us and Equestria has been an eyesore ever since it was cobbled together on the onset of independence. It’s about time we took it down, and established a more amiable, less hostile relationship with our neighbour in regards the immigration."
LSP_request_investment:0 "Request investments"
LSP_request_investment_desc:0 "Though ravaged by civil war, the Equestrian economy is still flowering. Certainly they have a little bit of spare profit to invest into Las Pegasus. After all, a few bit of investments could go a long way, and can only work to further bridge the gap between us. Not to mention, you know, money."
LSP_the_equestrian_rangers:0 "The Equestrian Rangers"
LSP_the_equestrian_rangers_desc:0 "We have the National Guard, yes, but few soldiers can stand up against the famed Equestrian Rangers. Battlehardened from combat, they will make a fine addition to Las Pegasus’ army, and Equestria would likely not mind having a tiny foothold of influence in Las Pegasus’ army."
LSP_request_recognition:0 "Request recognition"
LSP_request_recognition_desc:0 "We’ve come a long way, Equestria and Las Pegasus. From enemies, back to friends through circumstance. The wish to reunite is long gone, but that doesn’t mean there should be any animosity between us. It’s time to bury the hatchet - it’s time to request recognition from our mother-nation."

 LSP_expand_the_army_desc:0 "After a cursory look, it's become very obvious that more ponies are needed to fill the ranks. A handful of recruits per trench won't do - we need artillerymen, snipers, shock-troops, riflemen, gunners, tankers. We have a long road ahead - but the journey from Las Pegasus to Canterlot begins with a single step."
 LSP_mayor_sup_fire:0 "Bomb the Hell out of Them"
 LSP_mayor_sup_fire_desc:0 "Las Pegasus doesn't have the ponypower for heroic charges or grand tsunamis of soldiers crashing into enemy lines as seen in action movies. Our soldiers' lives are precious -  shells, however, are cheap. Why fight, when we can just bombard our enemy to smithereens?"
 LSP_shell_assembly_lines:0 "Shell Assembly Lines"
 LSP_shell_assembly_lines_desc:0 "We can't bombard our enemies with spit and rocks - if we want our artillery to do more damage than a light spring rain, we have to make sure we have the shells to fire. Investing in more adquate production lines for artillery pieces will make sure a lack of armament will not be an issue."
 LSP_thunder_bringer_battalion:0 "Bigger Gun, Better Performance"
 LSP_thunder_bringer_battalion_desc:0 "While Las Pegasus' artillery pieces are nothing to turn one's nose up at, it's wise to make sure we don't fall behind in the arms race. "Don't fix what ain't broke", as the old saying goes - but nothing stops us from improving our existing artillery."
 LSP_artillery_factories:0 "Artillery Factories"
 LSP_artillery_factories_desc:0 "As the army grows, the need for more artillery pieces to support our soldiers becomes apparent. Rather than putting undue strain on our other production centers, it'd be wiser to dedicate a whole new manufacturing sector for armament production."
 LSP_at_ap:0 "Eyes on the Sky"
 LSP_at_ap_desc:0 "We have big guns, yes - that's very good. But, those big guns are also immobile, and would be very easily targeted and destroyed by bombers or fast-moving tanks. Therefore, we should make sure that we don't leave them exposed by giving some attention to our anti-tank and anti-air capabilities."
 LSP_enhanced_rifles:0 "Improved Rifles"
 LSP_enhanced_rifles_desc:0 "As important as artillery is, it's still important that the soldier is ready and well-equipped. After all, the fire pieces only exist to soften up the enemy that the infantry must then fight - so we should make sure that said infantry only has access to the best weapons."
 LSP_not_one_wasted_life_:0 "Not One Wasted Life"
 LSP_not_one_wasted_life_desc:0 "With our limited ponypower, it only makes sense that we make sure none of it goes to waste. Our soldiers should have access to the same care in the field that civilians get in the city, and that means mobile hospitals, field kitchens, intensive care units, better medicine - anything for the fighting pony."

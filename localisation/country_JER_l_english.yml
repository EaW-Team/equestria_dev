 JER_memories_desc:0 "Shortly after the collapse of the Griffonian Empire the Kingdom of Aquileia experienced a revolution of its own.\n\nThe Revolution itself abolished the Discret Monarchy, and resulted in the proclamation of the First Aquileian Republic with Theodore Vérany at its head. Unfortunately, only five years after the Republic was created Marshal Berthelot led a counter-revolution which resulted in the Discret Restoration.\n\nIn spite of the Restoration there are still many within the country who refuse to let go of the dream of an Aquileian Republic thus making King Moriset's hold on the country tenuous at best."

 ### Events ###
 aquileia.1.t:0 "Weapons From The Capital"
 aquileia.1.d:0 "A large delivery of weapons has come from Aquila, courtesy of the royal armoury. With revolutionary tensions rising, these weapons likely will be invaluable in the coming months."
 aquileia.1.a:0 "Magnifique!"
 
 aquileia.2.t:0 "The Chouette Raids"
 aquileia.2.d:0 "The secret police has been on the move recently. Through their usual methods - unsavory as they are - they have revealed several revolutionary headquarters and raided them in the middle of the night. Hopefully, this will be enough to thwart the rebels."
 aquileia.2.a:0 "This will force the rats into the open..."
 
 aquileia.3.t:0 "The Pony March"
 aquileia.3.d:0 "A grand march through the countryside took place this week. Ponies, numbering in the thousands, marched from Pelis to Rila, holding royal banners and placards with pro-royalist slogans on them. In every village they passed more ponies join them, and as they reached Rila they filled the city square, singing the Royal Hymn and declaring their loyalty to the crown."
 aquileia.3.a:0 "Glad to see our Equine friends are still supporting us"
 
 aquileia.4.t:0 "Republicans Within the MPA Arrested"
 aquileia.4.d:0 "It seems that the local MPA have had greater issues than we suspected. The Chouette, acting on orders from Aquila, arrested over a dozen high ranking MPA members on charges of revolutionary activities."
 aquileia.4.a:0 "How Embarrassing"
 
 aquileia.5.t:0 "A Visit to Vinovia"
 aquileia.5.d:0 "Vinovia has been graced by the presence of the royal family. With tensions high, many had feared that a visit from the tempramental king would only make things worse, but thankfully the visitor turned out to be princess Vivienne. The princess, as charming as any griffin could be, took her time with both commoner and noble and was all smiles and delight. Even with the possibility of revolution ahead, for one evening the princess managed to assuage fears and give a moment of joy to all."
 aquileia.5.a:0 "Thank Eyr Moriset sent Vivienne instead..."
 
 aquileia.6.t:0 "Letting Loose"
 aquileia.6.d:0 "So the revolutionary rats have crawled out of their holes again to make a mess of things, have they? Well, if they did not learn the last time, it seems we will have to teach them a lesson again. Let's make sure we are suitably excessive this time around."
 aquileia.6.a:0 "Violence solves most things"
 
 aquileia.7.t:0 "Search And Destroy"
 aquileia.7.d:0 "Pridean forces have struck all over Pridea, dragging the traitors and their sympathisers out of their holes kicking and screaming. The citizens are too afraid to defy us, knowing the price of treason, and by the time we're done there will not be a single rat left in all of Pridea!"
 aquileia.7.a:0 "None can hide from us!"
 
 aquileia.8.t:0 "Friends In the MPA"
 aquileia.8.d:0 "It seems the MPA have been receiving aid from Aquila. That's splendid news as it means that there's more fighters out there, willing to fight for Aquileia. "
 aquileia.8.a:0 "Magnifique"
 
 aquileia.9.t:0 "Rila Holds"
 aquileia.9.d:0 "The revolutionaries came, and the revolutionaries failed. They thought they could break Rila, but it broke them instead. Raise the royal banner high, Rila Holds!"
 aquileia.9.a:0 "Hurray!"
 
 aquileia.10.t:0 "The Revolution in Rila"
 aquileia.10.d:0 "Early this morning, the Duke fled Rila after the streets were blocked by revolutionaries and several military units declared for the Republic! Things are still chaotic and the road ahead is long, but with the Jewel of the North in our claws, it is clear that the first great step has been taken!"
 aquileia.10.a:0 "Long live the Republic!"
 
 aquileia.11.t:0 "Monarchist MPA Coup"
 aquileia.11.d:0 "The revolutionaries had sunk their claws deep into Westkeep, but early this morning the loyalist MPA launched a counter-coup, securing the capitol and declaring their intent to stand by the King."
 aquileia.11.a:0 "Long live the Discrets!"
 
 aquileia.12.t:0 "The Revolution in Westkeep"
 aquileia.12.d:0 "The MPA are patriots, but that means they believe in Aquileia, not the Discrets. Westkeep has declared for the revolution. It is time to throw down these old tyrants and free the people of Aquileia."
 aquileia.12.a:0 "For the Revolution and the Aquileian people!"
 
 aquileia.13.t:0 "Vinovia Holds"
 aquileia.13.d:0 "It seemed like disaster might strike, but in the end, the Duke's leadership has seen us through, and the revolutionaries have failed in their objectives. Despite the chaos in the streets, all reports say that the loylaist forces are driving them back and the rightful order remains intact."
 aquileia.13.a:0 "As if there was ever any doubt"
 
 aquileia.14.t:0 "The Revolution in Vinovia"
 aquileia.14.d:0 "Down with the tyrants! Our forces have secured the Ducal palace and the outlying regions of the capitol. Raise high the banner of Vinovia and march forth! We march for freedom, to victory!"
 aquileia.14.a:0 "For the Revolution and the Vinovian people!"
 
 aquileia.15.t:0 "Pridea Holds"
 aquileia.15.d:0 "Despite the efforts of the traitors and revolutionaries, Pridea remains loyal to the crown. They tried their best, but it was all for naught, and it seems we are dragging more traitors to the wall again."
 aquileia.15.a:0 "Magnifique!"
 
 aquileia.16.t:0 "The Revolution"
 aquileia.16.d:0 "In a stunning display of boldness and élan, former exile Théodore Vérany returned to Aquileia, an army of Aquileian peasantry and formerly hidden supporters at his back, and stormed the Royal Palace, capturing the King and proclaiming the creation of the Second Aquileian Republic, as both the Aquileian Republican Army and Socialists fought the Aquileian military in the streets themselves. Time will tell what this means for the country, as it falls once again into bloodshed."
 aquileia.16.a:0 "Long live the Republic!"
 
 aquileia.17.t:0 "The Triumphant Revolution"
 aquileia.17.d:0 "It has been a long and bloody road, but today, the last of the monarchist vassals has finally collapsed beneath the unstoppable tide of freedom! Thanks to widespread and organized revolutionary fervor and the countless valiant sacrifices of so many griffons, the supporters of the old monarchy have been crushed, and the lineage of the Discrets scattered to the winds. Even the officers that once begrudgingly fought beneath the banners of cruelty and tyranny have been swayed by our cause, and have pledged their undying support to the new republic. They will safeguard Aquileia from the return of the Discrets, as surely the taint of their royal blood lingers in bastards across Griffonia, but with their help, Aquileia is free, and a new day dawns on us and our new republic!"
 aquileia.17.a:0 "Long live the Republic!"
 
 aquileia.18.t:0 "The Triumphant Revolution"
 aquileia.18.d:0 "It has been a long and bloody road, but today, the last of the monarchist vassals has finally collapsed beneath the unstoppable tide of freedom! Thanks to widespread and organized revolutionary fervor and the countless valiant sacrifices of so many griffons, the supporters of the old monarchy have been crushed, and the lineage of the Discrets scattered to the winds. Though our enemies fought on to the bitter end, they have all been defeated on the field of battle, their armies crushed and routed. A new generation of heroes will safeguard Aquileia from those that would see the monarchy restored yet again, but with their help, Aquileia is free, and a new day dawns on us and our new republic!""
 aquileia.18.a:0 "Long live the Republic!"
 
 aquileia.19.t:0 "A Few Missing Rifles"
 aquileia.19.d:0 "The quartermaster walked through the depot, a clipboard clutched in one claw. "Twenty-four new artillery pieces," she murmured to herself, counting out the new cannons and scratching a note in the clipboard. "Fifty mortar tubes and grenades... check. Replacement rifle parts... check."\n\nShe hummed to herself as all the numbers on her charts added up. So far, so good. She prided herself on taking good notes, and not having a mishap in her depot since her posting. "Let's count the guns, then I can get some tea with Louis..."\n\nIt was always the chore she saved for last. Not only did she have to count the crates, but the factories never rigorously checked how many rifles they put in the crates, so sometimes her numbers could be off. Even years after the revolution had been crushed, not all of Aquileia's wheels turned smoothly.\n\n"...forty-six, forty-seven, forty-eight... forty-eight?" She counted the crates again. "There were supposed to be fifty crates..." Maybe the factories had crammed more guns into the crates to save wood? But after spending an hour cracking open crates and counting their contents, the quartermaster had no answer for the missing guns.\n\nShe'd have to report this to her higher ups. Lunch with Louis would have to wait."
 aquileia.19.a:0 "Quite odd wouldn't you say?"
 
 aquileia.20.t:0 "Gone Like The Wind"
 aquileia.20.d:0 "The spymaster general dug his claws into his skull. The reports kept rolling in, one after the other. It seemed like every revolutionary cell in the kingdom had simply disappeared overnight, their members gone with the wind. Some of his spies believed that the cells had simply given up the fight, but he knew better. They wouldn't all disperse in unison. They had to be planning something. But there were dozens of cells with hundreds of griffons that his spies were keeping track of. Now, not a one could be found. Where did they all go?!"
 aquileia.20.a:0 "Now where did they go off to?"
 
 aquileia.21.t:0 "Assistance From The MPA"
 aquileia.21.d:0 "With revolutionary sentiment growing throughout the kingdom once more, griffons have been organizing and gathering in secret and making demonstrations in public. Unrest grows by the day, but stability and order is coming from an unexpected source: the fascists of the Mouvement Patriote d'Aquileia. The fascists are very organized and well-equipped, and they have lent our gendarmeries a helping claw in keeping unrest suppressed. Thanks to their help, our police force can focus on more pressing matters, like rooting out all the revolutionaries we can find and piling their heads beneath the guillotine!"
 aquileia.21.a:0 "That's rather generous of them?"
 
 aquileia.22.t:0 "Increased Chouette Activity"
 aquileia.22.d:0 "Recent days have seen the Chouette, the secret police that serve as King Moriset's right claw, increase their presence and visibility throughout the kingdom, breaking down the doors of suspected revolutionaries in the middle of the night and publicly executing them by day. In this day and age, no griffon is safe from being a suspected sympathizer of the revolution, and the Chouette have taken it upon themselves to sort the matter out once and for all."
 aquileia.22.a:0 "How strange"
 
 aquileia.23.t:0 "Support From the Capital"
 aquileia.23.d:0 "With revolutionary sentiment rising throughout the Kingdom of Aquileia, several companies of soldiers and additional support for our gendarmerie arrived today to bolster our numbers, bearing official papers signed by the king himself. These extra griffons will help keep an eye out for any rebel organizations in our lands, and are already swiftly being integrated into our local gendarmeries and briefed on the current situation."
 aquileia.23.a:0 "That's absolutely grand!"
 
 aquileia.24.t:0 "The Fire Rises"
 aquileia.24.d:0 "Private Noelle stared at the growing mound of papers gathering in the gendarmerie station. The police had been bringing them in all day, with griffons constantly coming and going ever since the sun rose that morning. She was barely literate and struggled to read out the words on the pamphlet clutched in her talons, but the revolutionary tricolour was easy enough to see. She needed no script to know what that meant.\n\n"Find the printers that helped them make these," her sergeant grumbled, tearing a pamphlet in half out of frustration. "Better yet, just arrest all the printers in the city. We can't have anymore pamphlets on the streets, you understand?"\n\nNoelle saluted in acknowledgement. "It will be done, sir," she said, and then quickly slipped out of the station at his dismissal. But even as she stepped outside, she saw a pair of griffons down the street snatching two pamphlets off the ground and tucking them into their overcoats. Arresting all the printers in Pridea might put a pause to new pamphlets being spread, but once words put an idea in a griffons head, it was notoriously hard to shake out.\n\nPerhaps for the first time in her life, Noelle was glad she couldn't read."
 aquileia.24.a:0 "If only more of our subjects were illiterate"
 
 aquileia.25.t:0 "Murders Most Foul"
 aquileia.25.d:0 "Ever since King Moriset returned from Zebrica and reclaimed the Aquileian throne, those that supported him have been rewarded with better postings and better pay all throughout the kingdom. Perhaps this is not more evident than in the Barony of Pridea, where ponies that collaborated with the king and Marshal Berthelot have climbed the ranks of the gendarmerie, and now command griffon underlings of their own. Last night, however, a string of coordinated attacks on gendarme officers left many of these ponies dead and sent those remaining on the force into hiding, fearing for their lives. Racial tensions in Pridea are beginning to boil over, and this could only be the work of those damn Revolutionaries!"
 aquileia.25.a:0 "The Revolutionaries are getting bolder"
 
 aquileia.26.t:0 "Mail-Order Disaster"
 aquileia.26.d:0 "Pridea's gendarmerie is already stretched thin enough as it is with the deaths and resignations of our pony brethren in the force, so perhaps it was no surprise that a bomb managed to make its way inside of Baron Dennis' castle. The bomb had been stuffed inside a crate carrying a statue of himself the Baron had commissioned, and was wired to explode when the crate was split open, in anticipation of our baron being present for its reveal. As luck would have it, the Baron's art collector couldn't help but sneak a peek at the scupture before its reveal, and while Dennis will need a new collector for his private gallery and some repairs done to the stonework of his castle, the vile revolutionary plot has failed. Still, the plot is the talk of the barony, and it is sure to spread revolutionary tensions across Pridea..."
 aquileia.26.a:0 "Find whoever did this!"
 
 aquileia.27.t:0 "Rising Extremism"
 aquileia.27.d:0 "The past few days have seen Vinovia erupt into a veritable volcano of chaos and extremism. It began with a public speech by a revolutionary sympathizer in the town square that was quickly interrupted by our loyal gendarmerie. However, before they could disperse the crowd and place the sympathizer under arrest, a brick thrown from a nearby building struck a gendarme in the back of the skull, killing him instantly. The sergeant in charge of the gendarmerie then attempted to place every griffon present under arrest, and when some began to resist, his unit began indiscriminately firing into the crowd, killing seventeen and wounding dozens more. Riots broke out that night, and the city took on an orange glow as the mob set fires to storefronts and the homes of gendarmes and loyalists to the monarchy. Another confrontation between the mob and the gendarmes led to a brutal fistfight that saw scores wounded on both sides before a battalion of professional soldiers arrived to scatter the mob. Over the next few days, revolutionary sentiment has only seemed to increase, with more protests and riots throughout Vinovia. Our gendarmerie and the army are doing the best they can to control the situation, but calling it a tense time would be an understatement."
 aquileia.27.a:0 "It will pass"
 
 aquileia.28.t:0 "The Scandal"
 aquileia.28.d:0 "A snicker from the adjacent room took Duke Gadiffer's attention away from the book he read in his study. Frowning, the Duke placed a marker between the pages and looked up, his eyes meeting those of a pair of maids looking at him from the other room. Too late, the griffonesses realized that the Duke had heard him, and their faces paled at his stern look.\n\n"Come here," he ordered them, setting the book aside. Reluctantly, the two maids nervously stepped into his study, bowing their heads before the duke. After a moment to look them over, the Duke sharply frowned. "Were you laughing at me?"\n\n"N-No, milord," the first maid answers. "We would never!" exclaims the other.\n\n"Lie to me, and I'll take your tongues," the Duke warns them. After letting that threat sink in, he steeples his claws together. "Now," he says, staring them down. "What have I done that you find so amusing?"\n\n"I-It's lies, milord," the first maid says. "We were laughing at how absurd they are."\n\n"Lies?" Duke Gadiffer asks. "What lies?"\n\n"They commonfolk... they say your beak is crooked."\n\n"Crooked?" Gadiffer blinked. Then he laughed. "Oh, that's it? That's what's so funny?"\n\n"They also said you've got a balding spot on your head... and your talons are dull... but your brain is duller..." Gadiffer and the first maid looked at the second, who rattled off the talk of the town. "You're impotent and prefer the presence of gentlegriffs to hens... and chicks aren't allowed near the castle for their own safety..."\n\nThe duke held up a claw, silencing her. "Say one more thing and forget losing your tongue, I'll have your head." His simmering rage left the two maids fidgeting uncomfortably before them, before he angrily waved them away. "Leave me. Now."\n\nThe two maids wasted no time curtsying and scampering out of hte room as fast as they could, leaving the Duke to fume on the slander that was apparently making its way around Vinovia. Finally, sighing, he opened his book back up and tore through the pages with renewed energy, simply trying to take his mind away from the lies of the revolutionaries."
 aquileia.28.a:0 "No griffon will believe them, right?"
 
 aquileia.29.t:0 "Take It To The Duke"
 aquileia.29.d:0 "Duke Gadiffer watched the mob gather outside the gates of his castle in dismay. They weren't being particularly violent, which was a good thing, though he did have soldiers lining the walls with their weapons displayed to discourage any sort of unruly behaviour. The bad news was the slander and insults they chanted weren't that much better. It seemed the rumors he'd gotten out of his maids weren't exactly a limited sentiment, nor did they blow away on their own.\n\nAfter listening to their shouts for a few minutes, the Duke turned to his captain of the guard in exasperation. "Make them go away!" he shouted, emphatically gesturing with his claws. "Shoot them if you have to. Just make them stop!"\n\nThe captain bowed in acknowledgement and walked away, shouting orders to his nearby subordinates, and the Duke sighed and buried his face in his hand. With his respect in Vinovia all but gone, he could only watch as his supporters disappeared, one by one, and the ranks of the revolutionaries grew. And all because of one stupid rumor! Maybe he should just start executing anygriffon that continues spouting those lies. His beak wasn't that crooked after all..."
 aquileia.29.a:0 "They can't do that! Shoot them... or something!"

 aquileia.30.t:0 "The Death of Marshal Berthelot"
 aquileia.30.d:0 "Marshal Berthelot, the griffon most responsible for the destruction of the First Aquileian Republic and the restoration of Moriset Discret to the throne of Aquileia passed away today at the age of 87. The old Marshal was found dead in his manor in Vyzima by one of his servants, a quick examination proved that Berthelot had passed away naturally and a funeral procession was organised by his family and friends. Although Berthelot is seen as a hero by some Aquileians the majority of our people considered him a scoundrel and a lackey of the Discret family, thus making both him and his death a deeply dividing matter."
 aquileia.30.a:0 "Rest in peace old friend."
 
 aquileia.31.t:0 "The Royal Execution"
 aquileia.31.d:0 "The Republic claimed its grandest prize yet today with the capture and swift execution of the hated King Moriset. A daring raid last night saw the royal palace seized just before the break of day, and King Moriset was captured before he could slip out of a hidden passage in his bedroom. The King was immediately taken to his throne room in irons, where the Council had set up a court to try him from the room where he once condemned thousands of Revolutionaries to their deaths with his words alone. Today, however, the King seemed less interested in defending himself from his crimes, instead spewing insults at Theodore Vérany, the Republic, and the griffons of Aquileia who had brought him to justice. He was swiftly found guilty by unanimous decision of the court, and was dragged to the town square to meet the guillotine that had claimed so many of our comrades. The royal continued to spit forth vile slander against the Republic, threatening his unending wrath were he not released, up until the moment the blade removed his head from his body. He had very little to say after that.\n\nUnfortunately, the King's daughter, Vivienne, did not meet the same fate as her father. It seems there may have been a secret monarchist guarding her cell; either that, or the harlot used her charms to seduce a weak-willed comrade and convinced him to let her go free. Whatever the case may be, the hated Discret dynasty lives on, though with the king dead, Vivienne is likely to see her friends and supporters abandon her in the coming weeks. It is only a matter of time now."
 aquileia.31.a:0 "Thus Unto Tyrants!"
 
 aquileia.32.t:0 "The Flight Of The King"
 aquileia.32.d:0 "Just before the dawn, a team of experienced revolutionaries, veterans from the glorious first revolution, assaulted the royal palace in unison with the uprisings throughout the capital. One team was tasked with breaching the walls with a wagon full of dynamite. A second was to land on the highest spires and fight their way inside, sealing the palace from the top down. A third was to surround the palace and make sure no griffon fled into the night.\n\nOf course, no plans go off without a hitch. The first team struggled to set off the wagon full of powder owing to the morning drizzle, costing valuable time. The second team was discovered circling above the palace waiting for the explosion, and the resulting shootout alerted the soldiers on the grounds to the attempt. By the time the first two teams successfully secured the palace, King Moriset and his family was nowhere to be found, and the third team fell for a diversion meant to draw their attention away from the fleeing king. King Moriset has vanished into the night, and our chance to end the vile Discret line in one fell swoop is gone."
 aquileia.32.a:0 "Damn it all!"
 
 aquileia.33.t:0 "The Rila Bombing"
 aquileia.33.d:0 "A deafening blast broke windows and shook the buildings of central Rila today. Dazed citizens staggered out of their buildings and into the street, only to be greeted by a rising cloud of black smoke over the town square. This morning, vile rebels detonated a bomb in front of the statue of King Gerad, demolishing the statue and killing a platoon of soldiers marching by at that moment. Similar bombings were coordinated throughout the city, with the targets being a recruitment station, a post office, and a naval dockyard. Altogether, twenty soldiers lost their lives in these vicious attacks, and the city of Rila has been placed under martial law until the suspects have been apprehended."
 aquileia.33.a:0 "Bollocks!"
 
 aquileia.34.t:0 "The Word Spreads"
 aquileia.34.d:0 ""Sergeant Dupont!"\n\nSergeant Dupont raised his head from the papers in front of him, missives from his superiors in Aquileia. "What is it, Henri?" the sergeant asked. Henri was supposed to be with the rest of his patrol along the wharves. Were they attacked by rebels?\n\nHis answer came when Henri held out a claw. In it was a piece of paper, marked with the distinct tricolour of the long-lost revolution. "We found these down by the shipyards."\n\n"These?" Sergeant Dupont asked, taking the paper from the private. It was a revolutionary pamphlet, decrying the monarchy and urging the peasants to fight for their 'freedom', whatever misguided concept the rebels supposed that was. "Are there more?"\n\nHenri nodded and dug into his bags. When he pulled his claw out, a fat stack of pamphlets came with it. "We tried collecting all we could, but..."\n\nSergeant Dupont stared at the stack in disbelief. How did the rebels manage to print so many pamphlets? He stood up and moved past Henri, heading for the door, the confused private following in his wake. Turning the latch with a claw, the sergeant looked out into the street, beak falling slack at the dozens of pamphlets drifting down the cobbles, carried along by the breeze.\n\n"I won't need to go far to look for stationary to tell the general about this...""
 aquileia.34.a:0 "Bloody Revolutionaries!"
 
 aquileia.35.t:0 "The Meshorio Raid"
 aquileia.35.d:0 "While the previous revolution may have have centralized in the holdings of the previous King of Aquileia, one of its most fervent and chaotic breeding grounds was the Duchy of Rila. Here, revolutionary sentiment took root in dozens of different flavors, leading to the foundations of almost innumerous Revolutionary Clubs throughout the Duchy. While most nominally attempted to organize to beat back Monarchist sentiment, cooperation between the clubs has never been a guaranteed thing, and most were almost more eager to backstab each other than to take the fight to the monarchists. That sentiment seems to be changing today for the fractured clubs, however. One club in particular, the Meshorio Peasants, has been growing in strength lately. Where they are getting the additional support from, we cannot say, but their activity and recruitment has increased dramatically throughout the Duchy. Other clubs are either falling in line behind them or disappearing entirely, but one thing is absolutely certain: the clubs are growing in strength once more, and when the clubs begin to grow, Revolution is not far behind."
 aquileia.35.a:0 "The Clubs are getting bolder..."
 
 aquileia.36.t:0 "Raising Unrest"
 aquileia.36.d:0 "It's a sound in the night, a whisper in a coffee house, a figure darting down an alleyway. It's the barred windows, the tense atmosphere, the way that young griffon's eyes watch you walk down the street. A hen cries out in outrage over rising bread prices, and a pair of gendarmes drag her away. A gang of angry young griffons and griffonesses marches down the streets, waving signs condemning the King and championing the rights of the working class. Pridea no longer feels safe, and Baron Dennis Discret's rule is no longer secure. The winds of change have arrived: the Revolution is coming to Pridea once more."
 aquileia.36.a:0 "Not again!"
 
 aquileia.37.t:0 "A Murder Most Foul"
 aquileia.37.d:0 "For years, the loyal pony minorities throughout the Barony of Pridea have formed the backbone of Baron Dennis Discret's militant gendarmerie. They aided him in retaking the city during the first Revolution, and were amply rewarded with high postings throughout the new gendarmerie and his personal army. Today, however, that seems to have made the ponies a target of the Revolution. Dozens of pony gendarmes and low-ranking military officers were systematically targeted and murdered throughout the previous week, crippling our gendarmerie and sending our loyal ponies into a fearful frenzy. While this has raised support for the monarchy to an all-time high amongst the pony population, they remain still a majority, and for every new pony swearing themselves to protect the monarchy, five new griffons meet in secret to plot its downfall, throwing their traitorous weight behind the coming of a second revolution."
 aquileia.37.a:0 "Damn them!"
 
 aquileia.38.t:0 "The Strike"
 aquileia.38.d:0 "The dockyards of Pridea are the pride of the Barony, and Pridea's naval thinkers are some of Aquileia's finest. Thus it was a great blow to the monarchy and Baron Dennis Discret's hold over the city when a massive strike broke out along the wharves, shutting down the dockyards. Hundreds of griffons gathered outside of the property, denying entry to any and all, and demanding better pay, better treatment, and better hours before they would return to work. The strike was broken up by the local marshal and the ringleaders arrested after a furious melee that saw more than a few griffs tumble into the harbor waters, but there is no guarantee it won't happen again... "
 aquileia.38.a:0 "The Dockyards of all places?"
 
 aquileia.39.t:0 "Funding From Aquila"
 aquileia.39.d:0 "Wagons full of gold bullion arrived today in Westmarch, having made a difficult and perilous journey across the Kingdom, managing to somehow skirt past the pockets of unrest and republican sentiment scattered throughout. Colonel Colette personally received the wagons outside of her keep, and after exchanging a few words with the soldiers guarding the wagons, gave them permission to enter the stronghold. The wagons presumably came from the crown, but no royal mark was present on the crates of bullion; perhaps that was to keep their journey secret, their contents unassuming. Instead, only a short letter accompanied the shipment. "Make good use of this in the coming struggle," it said. "We know where your loyalties lie." No names demarcated the parchment, and the only signature plainly listing off the sender as "Your Friends in Aquileia."\n\nCollete smiled as she put the letter away. Was was coming to the Kingdom once more, and there was no better place for a soldier than on the front lines."
 aquileia.39.a:0 "Wonderful!"
 
 aquileia.41.t:0 "The Pascal Affair"
 aquileia.41.d:0 "The Republic is gripped with suspicion and paranoia as an artillery officer within our fair republic's army was placed under arrest, having been suspected of sending letters to correspondents within the Empire! To think that one of our fair citizens would attempt to exchange information and secrets with the power-hungry despots in Griffenheim is horrifying and almost unbelievable! There in lies the problem however, independent investigations have concluded that Pascal was not sending these letters, after interviewing his fellow officers as well as his own family. They considered him a "True Patriot to the Republic, and would give his life for it." Many suspect that the Policegriffons sent to arrest him placed these false documents within his home, and that these griffons were agents of the MPA, hoping to stir up anti-pony sentiment. Whatever the case may be, all Ponies within the republic are to be closely watched now."
 aquileia.41.a:0 "These are not our republican ideals!"
 
 aquileia.42.t:0 "Zolavi Passes Away"
 aquileia.42.d:0 "Notable journalist and novelist Émile Zolavi has recently died, in his old home on the Aquilan outskirts. His writing career has inspired a new trend in Aquileian culture, short-lived as it was, and his outspoken approach even convinced the government to loosing their grip on the society. His most notorious action, however, was a full scale condemnation of the ruling officials during the Pascal affair. His caustic, inflammatory accusation spared none, and he was quickly sued for libel. As a result, Zolavi escaped abroad to New Mareland, where he continued to defend his close friend Pascal. He was only recently permitted to return, but the stress of his prosecution has left him weary of life. The government of Aquileia has decided to name their newly formed literature prize after Zolavi, to honour his contribution to society. "

 aquileia.43.t:0 "Rabble-rousing Griffon Causes Mischief"
 aquileia.43.d:0 "Voracious lover of life and dandy, Charles Beaklaire was well known in the artistic circles of Aquila for his rather divisive poetry. While a vocal minority considered his work to be a rejuvenation of art, far more considered them to be works of complete debauchery. The numerous lawsuits and charges of defiling public morals have not deterred Beaklaire from publishing more verses on themes of modernity, love and wine. Additionally, he has taken it personally to confront his critics, causing multiple public brawls. This has resulted in many griffons receiving serious injuries, as Beaklaire is overly fond of the bottle, and great damage to public property. Recently however, his brief stint in the prison has somewhat mellowed him out, yet his works continue to cause much controversy in the cafés of Aquila."
 aquileia.43.a:0 "Artists are a rather special bunch."
 
 aquileia.44.t:0 "Plumus Publishes L’Étranger"
 aquileia.44.d:0 "Albert Plumus is a name that has quickly risen in the artistic circles of Aquileia. His absurdist approach towards life, which is widespread in his works, has attracted many griffons, weary of the constant wars raging across the world. He has recently finished his newest novel, titled L’Étranger (The Outsider), which follows Griffsault and his indifferent lifestyle. The critics praised the main character's disposition towards life, authority and religion, stating that these are the proper values for the uncertain times. Thus, the book has quickly became an integral part of any Aquileian's shelf."

 aquileia.46.d:0 "The worst has come to pass! Despite all our efforts, the revolutionaries have risen up against the crown. Armed militants are in the streets, garrisons have been bombed and the royal palace itself was assaulted by a force of disloyal soldiers.\n\nThe revolutionaries' first attack was beaten back by the valiant Royal Guard, but now the nation is aflame as chaos reigns everywhere. We must rally our forces and strike back at these traitors before they have a chance to achieve their goals."

 aquileia.49.d:0 "Terrible news from the royal palace!\n\nDuring one of His Majesty's baths, a servant snuck into the quarters and stabbed him! While the servant was swiftly apprehended by the Royal Guards, it was too late to save His Majesty. At 16:23, His Most Honorable Majesty King Moriset Discret passed away even as the doctors did all they could.\n\n All of Aquileia is in shock from the terrible event, having thought that the revolution was over and yet those damn rebels managed to spite the nation with their last breath. The one small comfort available for us in this dark time is princess Viviane, whom all thought would be paralyzed by grief. Instead, she appeared before the gathered court that very evening, being crowned Queen Vivienne Discret of Aquileia."

 aquileia.50.d:0 ""A for Aquila, where Her Majesty lives. B for Bread, such as Baguette or Brioche..." Monsieur Mésange said, pointing to the poster with his pointer as the young children in the benches all obediently echoed him.\n\nHe supposed that this was not what he had expected to be doing with his life. Teaching in a small rural town in the depths of Orvaillo had seemed like such a dreary prospect, but it seemed that was where his life had taken him. The state paid a decent salary, and after the recent unrest he found the countryside good for his nerves.\n\nIn the corner of his eye he saw how one of the local farmers, the father of young Lacroix if he wasn't mistaken, was lurking by the door, glancing inside and mouthing along with the lecture. Of course... even the adults around here were illiterate.\n\n"Good afternoon Monsieur Lacroix, are you here for your son?" he decided to ask, the farmgriff startling. Before he could say anything though, Monsieur Mésange continued. "We are not quite finished yet, but please, have a seat. Maybe you can assist me if the children get too rowdy," he said with a smile as he motioned to the back of the classroom to help the farmgriff save face. Somewhat hesitantly, Monsieur Lacroix stepped inside and sat down as Monsieur Mésange returned to the beginning. "Once again now mes élèves: A for Aquila, where Her Majesty lives...""

 aquileia.51.d:0 "Remy's mother was curious about that book that her son had brought home from school. She hadn't at first been too sure about Monsieur Mésange, the city griffon had seemed so stuck-up and distant, and she couldn't understand why her son had to be away for so long to learn all these odd things. They needed him at the farm, after all.\n\nStill, Remy was happy, and he had taken to school like a fish to water. Maybe... she found herself dreaming as she stood by the stove... maybe this would really lead somewhere?\n\nRemy, meanwhile, was utterly absorbed in the book, reading about the strange and distant lands of "Equestria" and its supposedly immortal goddess-queen. Monsieur Mésange had let him borrow it on the condition that he'd perform a presentation on the book in front of the class, and Remy wasn't going to waste this chance. After all, Monsieur Mésange had told him that depending on how things went for him in school, any number of possibilities were open."

 aquileia.52.t:0 "Illiteracy Rates At An All Time Low"
 aquileia.52.d:0 "Remy sat quietly on the chair, his heart pounding as he had his parents to the left and Monsieur Mésange to the right. Having his teacher over at home was strange enough but Monsieur Mésange seemed to have something he wanted to say and only waited for the opening as Remy's mother kept nervously talking, asking for the third time if he'd like some more coffee.\n\n"I am here to discuss your son's efforts in school," the teacher began after a while. "See, Remy has been an exceptional student. He is dilligent and talented in equal measure, and I am convinced that he has the potential to succeed even in higher studies. Therefore," Monsieur Mésange said, smiling at Remy, "I would like to give you a recommendation so that you may go to the Lycée."\n\nRemy tried to say something and accept politely, but the news made his eyes well up and he didn't manage to do anything but to nod as tears of relief and happiness began to flow down his cheeks. Thankfully his father eagerly said yes in his stead as his mother wrapped him in her arms, tears of her own beginning to flow."

"We packed warm clothes, did we not? What of your shirt? Do you have your best one?" Remy couldn't help but blush a little but bore it silently as the train rolled into the station and they boarded. Finding a seat, Remy sat down as his father helped him to get the bags up on the shelves above them\n\n"Mom, I will be okay," Remy said, giving his mom a hug. In truth, he was scared himself. He had barely even left the town before, and that he'd now move all the way to Vanguardigo to attend school was still a dizzying prospect.\n\n As his parents got off the train, they delayed outside, waving goodbye to him as the train began to slowly move again. Remy couldn't help but notice that his mother seemed to start crying again and swallowed to choke down his own tears.\n\nIt was frightening, but it was also exhilarating. For the first time, this farmboy from rural Orvaillo found he could dream. First the Lycée, then Université, then who knew where? The future was his now, and he wasn't going to waste it!"

Many of us hold the notion that loyalty is something that stays in the species and that "outsiders", wherever they come from, cannot be part of this loyal bond."\n\n"I say to you, people of Aquileia, that this has proven itself utterly false not once, but twice in our nation. Our noble pony subjects have twice been among the most fierce and brave protectors of this nation that any monarch could wish for. My father knew their strength and in the recent monhts, so have I come to know it. Where griffons marched in the streets, seeking to overthrow their rightful king, the ponies remained loyal nigh on to the last stallion. I am proud to declare that for these many services, today shall be known the Day of the Faithful, the day where we remember that loyalty and duty is not born in feathers or a beak, but in word and in action, no matter where one comes from.

It seemed Moriset had other ideas though, and lashed out, denouncing all those who would dare to harbour such sentiments as traitors deserving only the guillotine.\n\n His majesty may have scared some griffins straight, but a LOT more are now dismayed by this brutish display."

The Duke ordered the Ducal guard out to the palace gates and personally demanded the demonstrators scatter. When they refused to obey, he ordered the guard to open fire.\n\nWhen the smoke cleared, almost a hundred lay dead in the streets, with the police, the Ducal Guard and even the military storming the houses and clubs of suspected revolutionaries to bring down the hammer upon anyone seeking to disrupt the peace of Vinovia.

The harder Denis pushes the more it seems the revolutionaries push back. Despite his best efforts over the years he has been unable to end the revolutionary threat, and soon they will march again."

On the program was inscenation showcasing important moments from Aquilean history from pen of our very own pridean writer Cherry Pen. Theatergoers were able to witness birth of Kingdom of Aquileia during the first spectacular act. Followed by second act where theatergoers were able to witness valiant stand of Aquilean soldiers against army of Grover I. during his conquest of Griffonia. One was really able to feel their patriotic zeal when defending the land and everyone living in there. In third act theatergoers could see rebellion of proud aquileian patriots led by their king against tyrannical rule of Grover II. which drew many parallels to rebellion of King Gerard Discret in 978 and restoring sovereignty of Aquileia. Casting of the play was excellent and except small technical mishap during the climax of second act this journalist can only praise execution and sheer dedication that went into this play. During the entire play theatergoers could freely enjoy food from banquet tables prepared for the occasion. After the play concluded, all those interested could stay for late night lecture where events showcased in play were fully explained in length."

Figure knocked three times. After a while door opened and young male red feathered griffon peered through the crack. He immediately recognized newcomer and smiled. "Pierre, good to see you!" He said friendly and let newcomer-Pierre inside. "I am sorry for being late." Pierre said with apologetic expression. "There were too many policeponies today. I couldn't risk leading them here, Louis." He explained as he removed his cloak, revealing not much older griffon with light orange feathers. "Don't worry we haven't started yet." Louis smiled. Both griffons moved into the next room where rest of the group was already gathered. Room was filled with griffons of all ages and genders. Some old, some young barely beyond being little chicks. They were no army for sure. Some wearing scraps of clothing others being armed with simple outdated revolvers. Yet atmosphere in the room was tense. "You would have us follow FJA? After they run away?!" One of the griffons shouted. "You do not understand. We need to work with them if we are to succeed. Only cooperation can ensure our victory over monarchists." His opponent argued. "NO! FJA is merely Vérany's band of bootlickers. Vérany who run away when things got tough. Abandoned everyone just to save his skin!" Yet another griffon chimed in. "Please be reasonable, comrades. We cannot win without compromise." Griffon continued to argue for alliance with FJA. "They are not so bad. We'll be able to enact our policies and FJA can help us quickly capture hearts of the people and establish truly free democratic nation. You must see that they are right." "Better coward than pony."

It became clear that if revolution in Pridea is to succeed FJA needs to bring all revolutionary elements within the city on board. Preparations for meeting between FJA party representative and Pridean communards were under way. Meeting had to be rescheduled and moved to different location several times to different location, for fear of being discovered by police authorities. It needs no mention that might spell disaster for the revolution as a whole. At last one night members of all sides met in a forest within territory of Duchy of Vinovia.

Do you remember the blood that flowed down the streets? No more! It cannot happen again!"\n\nCheers went up from the assembled crowd, and Gerald allowed himself a little smile. Aging as he was, he was still the leader of the MPA's monarchist bloc, and one of the party's most influential members as a whole. "The real threat lies in the communists that the Revolution harbors. They have dangerous ideas, dangerous ideas that will see this nation burn even moreso than those who merely cry out for freedom, whatever mockery they attribute to that word! They must be stopped!"\n\nAgain, cheering roared to meet him, but then he saw several griffons slipping out the doors in disgust. "Fools," he muttered to himself. He'd have his loyal enforcers find out who had left early, and make them sorry for it. "I have with me a list of communist sympathizers in Westkeep, gathered by my talons in the dark. We shall start with them and rid Aquileia of the communist menace once and for all! Who is with me?!"\n\nGriffons stood up and raised their voices, ready to join the march.

The Colonel has sent her soldiers to round up republicans and make arrests, but with the situation spiraling out of control as it is, it seems like a lost cause. To make matters worse, a recent meeting between the Colonel and nobles from the capital has made it clear that this increased recruitment has been going on throughout the Kingdom for some time, and it was only a matter of time before it made its way to Westkeep as well.

The Harmonists of the Front des Jeunes Aquileia - the FJA - have begun holding rallies in the streets of Vinovia, arquing that the Kingdom should reform to become a true democracy, a place where every griffon has a say in how the nation runs. While such ideas are certainly laughable and short-sighted, doomed to failure, the sizes of the crowds the FJA is beginning to attract are certainly worrying.

Normally, that would have been no cause for alarm - the mobs had always been poorly equipped - but today was different. Today, the mob brandished rifles of their own, clean and modern, obviously fresh out of a factory from somewhere. Where that somewhere was, Adeline had no idea. Of course, that didn't matter now. What mattered is that she was on the opposite end of a larger block of armed griffons, and with the company blocking the street from sidewalk to sidewalk, the mob couldn't possibly miss if they decided to open fire.\n\n"Think if we ask nicely they'll go away?" Remy asked from her side, his usually snarky jokes shaken with worry. "They could all fire their guns at once and not hit the side of a barn. It's not like they're trained, right?"\n\nBut Adeline knew better. Many of these griffons were older. Many probably fought in the previous Revolution. Many probably knew how to use the weapons they held. And when the mob started pointing their weapons at the gendarmes, her heart jumped into her throat.\n\n"Fire! Shoot them, damn it!" her sergeant shouted. Discipline moved her talon for her, training forcing her to follow the suicidal command, and Adeline squeezed her eyes shut in terror as she fired her rifle.\n\nThe mob's rebuttal ripped through the gendarmes with a terrifying thunder, and Adeline opened her eyes just in time to see a bullet drill right between them."

Now, with Election Day drawing ever nearer, Thibault has promised to continue the work he performed during the Revolution, by expanding his party and bringing regional representation to all the far-flung corners of Aquileia. He even seeks to continue providing homes for families displaced by the war, a move sure to see him attain easy gains at the ballot box.

Her messages of harmony amongst even enemies had a remarkable affect in the fighting, and Vinovia saw some of the least partisan bloodshed and extrajudicial killing in the entire Republic. Now, the griffoness the citizens of Vinovia call their rose has come to Aquileia to champion the peaceful reconstruction of the nation. In the power vacuum left by Vérany's departure, she has risen to the top of the FJA, championing all the tenets of the harmony that once made the party strong.

Centering around nationalism and Aquileian unity, the fascist Maréchal has unified griffons far and wide who fear the influence of the nations surrounding our great Republic and are looking for a strong leader to keep them safe. He champions the promotion of Aquileian culture and the expansion of our urban centers, as well as getting the former nobility to fall in line and provide some of their wealth to the Republic through generous pardons. Though the loyalties of the MPA throughout the revolutions are certainly suspect, it is quite clear that they are too large of a force with too much influence to simply label as traitors and be done with it.

There was no place for popular consent, greater ideals of statecraft or even a conception of life being more than obedient labour. Those ideas, any understanding of the great truths of the world really, were held not by them but by the likes of Kemerskai or Vérany. Michel always saw the republic as an experiment that had been worth trying, even if it cost to his family.  His birth didn’t leave him much choice in life but it gave him some power. His power had been the sword of ducal power. Yet, he tried to subvert it, transforming it into a tool to carve something new. If he had bore any other name than Discret, he would have been executed for treason already but the family let him indulge in hosting philosophers and artists if the bastilles would operate and if Rila was stable. Not enough, he thought. And he indulged more, helping the republicans to bring about\n\nAnd what now? The bastilles were ashes and Rila was clamoring for revolution. All because he followed his ideals, blind to the fact that his friends, those reasonable partisans of compromise, reform and freedom in either a monarchy or a peacefully installed republic, were drowned in the cries of blood. All because of these "enragés", the rabid members of this Cocardiers club. It was them who resonated with the people, who spoke to their lower instincts. They were everywhere in Rila now, robbing, pressuring, killing and worse. And they wouldn’t stop until all of the Discret family lay dead in a pit.\n\nYet maybe cooler heads would prevail in the end. Maybe the beast of old had to be put down before a fledgling freedom could emerge. Maybe his conscience had been right after all. Maybe."

 aquileia_two.2.d:0 "After weeks of careful planning, the Committee of Public Safety met for the very first time. The place of gathering was the mansion of count De Becignier, one of the rare noblegriffs sympathetic to the revolution. While some in attendance sneered at the mention of his name, he had been integral in guaranteeing safety and secrecy for the event.\n\nThe Committee was the first rilan attempt in years to federate the various republican organisations known in Rila as the revolutionary clubs. Of those there were many and of all stripes. Some, like the Société Justice or the Club de la Raison were more than willing to meet the monarchist halfway if it meant the perennity of the new institutions. Others were simply united in their conclusions of the failure of the monarchy and a need to end, some even socialist in nature. Others like the Club des Haies, the Fanal or the Club Patriote had more precise ideas as to what the future Republic would have to look like to be safe. However, the most important group of all was the Cocardiers, a group of radicals, single minded in ensuring that the second Republic would not be crushed, whatever the cost. And if the Republic was to not be crush, the monarchy would have to be. Brutally and utterly.\n\nReaching a compromise to make such a loose coalition had been a hurdle but it had been accomplished. They were there, two hundreds and twenty six representatives in attendance to plan and execute a revolution."

 aquileia_two.3.d:0 "Today, representatives from the Societé Justice presented to the Committee informations about the patrol plans and schedules of the security forces in Rila for the coming week. A strong debate was held as to what could be done with it. Some extremists from the Cocardiers wished to use the information to organize an uprising. However, the consensus was that it was still to early and that the information could be used for propaganda purposes. In the end, the propagandists prevailed and the Cocardiers’ plan was voted down, not without some name calling.\n\nThe representatives of the Club du Verbe Vrai were tasked to use their network within Rila’s print shops and bookstores to stockpile republican propaganda in the forms of posters, banners and notices. The Fanal was then tasked with using their followers, mostly illiterate workers, to insert the material in the streets.\n\nUnbeknownst to most of the Committee, the "informations" were in fact provided by Duke Michel himself. Members of the more reform-minded faction reached a deal with him to spread the word of republicanism in the capital. The security forces had in fact been given orders to clear the streets and stand down, effectively turning a blind eye to the whole operation."

 aquileia_two.4.t:0 "The Storming of the Bastilles"
 aquileia_two.4.d:0 "While some knew Rila as a place of fine wines, great coasts and theater but to the Republicans, it was also a prison. The restored regime wished to maintain prisoners away from the historical center of the revolution. It didn’t say idle either over the years since the end of the revolution, sending continuously more griffs to Rila. These prisoners were gathered in a few fortresses that would serve as fortified prison : the bastilles. As time went on, they become the living symbol of the royal oppression in Rila, standing high as a perpetual reminder of where lovers of liberty would go to die in darkness if caught.\n\nThe Committee, united in this at least, sought to put an end to theses prisons. They planned a mass-scale attack on all bastilles with the following objectives : starting fires and fights at various points in town to distract the troops, gather mobs of sympathizers, overwhelm the defenses, free the prisoners and loot as many guns as possible.\n\nOn [Root.GetDateText], the plan was executed. Mobs of republicans assembled and led by club members marched on the fortresses. In some places, they found sympathetic or cowardly guards who simply refused to engage them, opening the gates in exchange for their safety. Everywhere else, fighting followed and it was bloody and bruised that the republicans freed their comrades and common prisoners alike. That day, the Republicans grew in number by the hundreds and many tears of joy were shed as long lost friends and parents met again. Sadly, in the Flowerino bastille, the mob assembled by the local Cocardiers suffered greatly at the claws of the guards and butchered everygriff inside in a frenzied revenge.\n\nThe news alarmed the authorities who scrambled to crack down on the clubs but information was lacking. The ducal palace was panicking. Yet, one griff still stayed calm : duke Michel himself. Some of his advisors saw it as a sign of his resolve in the face of danger. Sadly, for them, it was not because of a strength of character but because he knew beforehand. After all, six fortresses don’t fall in a single day to angry mobs because of sheer revolutionary fervor..."

However, what the republicans have in strength of character, they lack in weaponry. And while one can argue that Aquileian republicanism is bulletproof, revolutionary bodies are not. The cause requires guns.\n\nThe committee explored many plans to gather weapons from the local arsenals or gunrunners but it ultimately failed. The arsenals in Rila were too well-guarded or too loyal to the regime.\n\nArmed with this, members of various clubs packed up and crossed the borders to Aquileia, linking with the republican lodges there. They consented to help of course but still it wasn’t enough to consider their mission even remotely successful. So, gnashing their beaks, the republicans indebted themselves to a variety of unsavory ponies and griffs from all over. Large sums were paid in exchange for jamming guns, poorly assembled contraband guns produced by socialists or some that were state of the art indeed should you have had them during the first revolution.\n\nThe Cocardiers smuggled it all back to Rila with difficulty. Some crates were lost in the border crossing after rilan border patrol griffs spotted one of their groups but all revolutionaries managed to finally come back to the republican compound in Dilven. There, despite their pained looks of disappointment, they were greeted with cheers by their comrades now in arms. The cause finally had claws."

The issue at claw had been a proposal from a Cocardier representative who argued that one of the cause of the first republic’s downfall had been the support from the wealthy to the monarchy. As such, he posited, any griff of wealth whose loyalty to the republican cause is not beyond doubt should be made a target and robbed of their wealth to fund the revolution. While the proposal was at first met with grumbles or shuckles from the moderates and reformists ranks, it resonated among many club representative from the lower classes and some socialists. They scolded the moderates and reformists for their unwillingness to follow through on the revolutionary ideal. After the attack was made against their rivals, the Cocardiers loudly heckled them and rallied around the proposal. Some moderates wavered while others tried to defend their reputation. Some left the meeting in protestation. In the end, the proposal was adopted.\n\nThe debate had some immediate consequences as members of various clubs decided to join the Cocardier cause, reinforcing their lead in the Committee further.\n\nIn the following weeks, members of the Cocardiers would begin organising raids on the so-called "rupins", wealthy nobles of Rila, and recruiting the populace to join in the looting."

After the roll call, the session fell into a semi-silence, a far cry from all previous sessions. There were some speeches, calm ones, but a recess was quickly called. Many groups gathered hastily to chat, some worried and other enthusiastic.\n\nWhen the committee went back in session, there were a few speeches. Club leaders were congratulating the new majority for bringing some clarity of purpose to their group. Some pointed to the necessity of fair debates and respect for one another. The speeches were respectfully applauded. Some less than others, prompting more worried looks among some representatives. Finally, the leader of the new majority rose. In his speech, he thanked the clubs for their support but called for unity. It was no longer time for half-measures.

Duke Michel knew they weren’t just coming from kitchens where families would lovingly make cherry pies together. He sighed sadly, knowing that it was a piece of Aquileia’s soul and spirit that was burning down there.\n\nIn the streets of Rila and in other cities, order had been given. All bookshops, printers and private libraries were to be raided. Any books deemed subversive to the established order of Aquileia and its vassals were to be gathered and burned in front for all to see.\n\nThe decision had been a tough one. His advisors had united against the duke who had committed himself to protect a certain degree of freedom of thought and writing among philosophers in Rila. He fought back but it was clear that if he didn’t comply, the fabric of his administration would begin to unravel at a time when he couldn’t afford to. It would enrage his friends and allies but it was a necessary compromise to maintain some degree of order. At least, it would keep the royal administration in Aquila at bay."

 aquileia_two.9.d:0 "Rila has long been plagued by difficulties in tax collection as well as a legacy of ducal fiscal concessions to the nobility. For years, the ducal advisors tried to sugarcoat it at court in Rila or Aquila but to put it plainly : the treasury is nearly empty. At this moment, credit is unavailable and the duchy needs funds to handle the instability.\n\nFortunately, the ducal administration has designed a policy based on an area where the ducal authorities has remained absolutely unchallenged : the organisation of fairs and marketplaces. Traditionally, it has been used to favor trade and the organization of fairs in all of Rila. It has historically made marketplaces and fairs much more popular in the ducal policies. The plan is to harness this popularity by enacting a decree banning trade outside of fairs and markets organized by the duchy and imposing a fee on all participating vendors. This would also placate the trading nobility and the merchants who heavily lobbied for interventions against new competition.\n\nThe decisions hasn’t gone down without immediate reactions. The coterie of liberal thinkers hosted by the duke is rather miffed, to put it mildly. Smaller merchants have also already began petitioning to lower the fee or repeal the decree. Duke Michel himself seemed sympathetic to these pleas and already agreed to grant some exceptions to various small farmers and artisans who regularly took parts to the markets."

Griffons and ponies alike are gathering to watch the grand parade, attend a grand ceremony at the temple of Eyr and finally ending with public festivities and even a grand popular ball at the main plaza ! Duke Michel will oversee it all himself as a grand marshall and will attend the festivities. One could even catch the eye of Rila’s most prized bachelor at the ball.\n\nNow, one would be hard-pressed to find a griff who could tell you the story of Weeping Renée in Rila. One who could is a griff with a burning passion for Aquileian folklore at duke Michel’s court. She was apparently a most devout griff who threw herself before emperor Grover II as he prepared himself to burn down Rila. While a fine story and a proof that history lessons may be needed, it mostly mattered as a justification for the grand festivities. And while the good people watches our duke dancing, a whole other kind of dance will happen all over the capital.\n\nThe ducal administration knew of many warehouses in the capital which could be potential safehouses or arsenals for the revolutionaries. The duke himself produced a list of specific warehouses owned by members of the Cocarcier revolutionary club. Asked by an advisor of how he discovered it, the duke simply chuckled : "Why Weeping Renée of course ! It is only normal she would come back to prevent other griffs from setting the duchy ablaze."

A true city of tents and music has been erected around the rural temple of Eyr known as the Rocher tranquille, the tranquil rock. Under the patronage of the duke, local artisans and farmers have been invited to sell and share their products, free of taxation. Artists are entertaining the masses and activities have been organized for the fledglings.\n\nWith only minimal security, duke Michel has braved the danger and mingles among the crowd. Numerous activities have been planned. Michel will notably be the judge of numerous contests, notably for the largest produce. Tonight, a great public feast will be organized, with the duke offering some wine barrels to the populace from his own vineyards. Tomorrow, a grand hunt will be organized for the local nobilities.\n\nYet, the true object of the party is not to entertain the common folk but to distract him. As griffs of all ages entertains themselves in a family-friendly manner, the ducal army has moved in the countryside. One by one, farmhouses are being raided for any traces of revolutionary hiding places or sympathizers.\n\nAs expected too, the presence of the duke attracted opportunistic revolutionaries, namely a local group of Cocardier terrorists. The fools tried to make a move on the duke. Sadly for them, the duke’s entourage had been tipped off and as soon as they tried to attack him, soldiers in civilian clothing jumped on them. Surprisingly enough, peasants joined the fight on the side of the duke, thinking the duke was indeed at risk. The trap suddenly transformed into a glorious moment as Michel thanked the crowd for saving his life. The fair was roaring with cheers for the duke. And all the while, the farms of the good cheering people were being thoroughly investigated."

With extraordinary speed, a grand Défilé was organized on the seaside streets in a celebration of Pélis, a true pearl of the duchy.\n\nYet, the elites of Rila had little interest in Pélisian naval tradition. However, they had been keeping tabs on the revolutionary activities in Pélis which was a well-known bastion of republicanism in the duchy. Revolutionary clubs like the Fanal or the Cocardiers had ample support among the dockworkers and shipyard workers. Local forces had gathered a lot of information but never used them, for fear that action could cause an uprising. The revolutionaries knew it and exploited it.\n\nThe Défilé allowed to finally break the revolutionaries surveillance. Ducal agents assembled in Pélis, disguised as civilians attending the Défilé. They came by cars, carriages, train, ships and even by foot. With their support and with the distraction from the Défilé, the local authorities finally launched a large scale raid. A bastion of hardline republicanism in Rila had fallen by a single stroke."

 JER_smuggle_it_in_desc:0 "When Dennis Discret returned to Pridea during the monarchist counter-revolution, he bestowed his gifts upon the griffons living in the city: cannonballs, mortar shells, and death. This year, it's time to return the favor and send him a gift that will blow him away."
 JER_infiltrate_aquila:0 "The Head Of The Snake"
 JER_infiltrate_aquila_desc:0 ""Cut off the head of the snake, and you will kill the wretched beast." King Moriset is the head of the monarchists, and as such, he must be the first to die. It's time to devote everything we can to ensuring Moriset dies with the rest of his vile line. The Discrets shall not escape the guillotine a second time!"
 JER_smuggle_the_weapons:0 "The Tools Of The Revolution"
 JER_smuggle_the_weapons_desc:0 "If we are going to see the monarchists exterminated, we will need rifles, and lots of them. Our collaborators will begin smuggling weapons into the capital which will greatly strengthen our position at the cost of weakening other revolutionary cells elsewhere in the Kingdom."
 JER_prepare_the_diaspora:0 "The Children Of The Revolution"
 JER_prepare_the_diaspora_desc:0 "Once we have guns, we need griffons to wield them on the field of battle. Send the call throughout the kingdom - we must summon revolutionaries from the far corners of Aquileia and bring them here to the capital. The City of Light must be taken and preserved at all costs if the revolution is to succeed."
 JER_ties_in_MPA:0 "The Rodier Connection"
 JER_ties_in_MPA_desc:0 "Though the fascists in the MPA are supposed supporters of the crown, their leader, Léonard Rodier, harbors secret republican sympathies. We must work together with Rodier to infiltrate and supplant King Moriset's gendarmerie in Aquileia, giving us a better chance at removing the king's head from his body."
 JER_infiltrate_the_prisons:0 "Spying On The Spies"
 JER_infiltrate_the_prisons_desc:0 "The king's spies, the Chouette his eyes and ears in the streets, and they have rooted out and executed dozens of upstart revolutionary cells over the past four years. Keeping a better eye on the Chouette should give us more warning when a raid is imminent, and better yet, track the king's movements."
 JER_infiltrate_the_palace:0 "Into The Lair Of The Beast"
 JER_infiltrate_the_palace_desc:0 "Without a plan in place to capture King Moriset, he will surely slip through our claws once more. We must be ready to assault his palace when the next revolution begins. Scouting the grounds and assembling a team of experienced revolutionaries will greatly improve our chances."
 JER_convince_the_officers:0 "A Few New Friends"
 JER_convince_the_officers_desc:0 "The king's army is full of generals who fought for him out of necessity, believing the previous revolution to be doomed to failure. While they were right then, this time will be different, and with enough convincing, we may be able to presuade them to join our cause."
 JER_stoke_the_fires:0 "Stoke The Fire"
 JER_stoke_the_fires_desc:0 "Discontent is rife within the king's army, and many of the soldiers openly bemoan his rule. If we can stoke the fires of revolution in their hearts, we may be able to convince them to abandon the king and join the new republic."
 JER_infiltrate_vinovia:0 "The Land Of Wine And Traitors"
 JER_infiltrate_vinovia_desc:0 "The revolution was sabotaged from within by weak revolutionary leaders in Vinovia, who laid down their arms under Duke Gadiffer's rule after hearing just a few measely speeches. If we want the next revolution to succeed, we will have to become more involved in Vinovia than last time."
 JER_encourage_extremeism:0 "Encourage The Radicals"
 JER_encourage_extremeism_desc:0 "The only way to break Duke Gadiffer's hold over Vinovia is to mobilize our more radical and fanatic elements to the duchy. If we can stir up a frenzy and start riots in the streets, the Duke's honeyed words will no longer be able to save his wretched spine."
 JER_political_slander:0 "Air The Laundry"
 JER_political_slander_desc:0 "One of Duke Gadiffer's tricks to dismantle and discredit the revolutionary factions in Pridea was with vile slander and false rumors about the moral character of their leaders. Well, two can play at that game, and soon the duke will be little more than a mockery throughout Vinovia."
 JER_anti_monarchist_rallies:0 "Stick It To the Duke"
 JER_anti_monarchist_rallies_desc:0 "With the Duke's credibility in shambles, it's time to march on his castle hold and show the soldiers there just how far he has fallen. A duke without an army is nothing to fear, and his friends and supporters are beginning to desert him at a wonderful rate."

 JER_the_orvaillo_mines_desc:0 "Orvalillo has long been one of the largest sources of coal within Auqelia, having supplied the country and surrounding areas with coal for years. But recent instability within the region has forced the mines to close, leaving a large source of coal within Aquileia unexploited. Financing the reopening and expansion of the mines would be trivial, and the benefits would make themselves obvious within weeks."

Aquileia must embrace naval aviation!"
 JER_cat_trade_interdiction_f:0 "Rousselot's Modern Piracy"

 JER_carrier_experiments:0 "Carrier Experiments"
 JER_carrier_experiments_desc:0 "Fleet Carriers are at the cutting edge of our technological capabilities. They will not only be required to launch and house squadrons of fighters.

For Aquileia, we will see it done."
 JER_submarine_experiments:0 "The Hidden Fleet"
 JER_submarine_experiments_desc:0 "When we looks at the immense ocean that lies before us, our very eyes are deceiving us. We are looking at a mirror which jealously guards the secret of what hides below its surface.

 JER_further_expansion:0 "La Maison de la Marine"
 JER_further_expansion_desc:0 "Aquila is not only our undisputed capital and the centre of arts, science and civilisation, but it is also quickly becoming the home of the fleet.

With them, we will be able to follow up a successful naval strike with a proper invasion."
 JER_landing_craft_f:0 "Improve Our Landing Craft"
 JER_landing_craft_f_desc:0 "The Troupes de la Marine need to actually get to the coast, if we are to launch any successful invasion. Although we considered letting the marines fly towards the enemy, an airborne approach makes them easy targets for enemy fire. We will have to design all-weather armoured transports to protect them until they can get in effective firing range."
 JER_expanding_the_marines:0 "Expand the Troupes de la Marine"
 JER_expanding_the_marines_desc:0 "The marines are the elite of our armed forces, but sadly there are just not enough of them at the moment.

These duellists will outclass any opponent!"
 JER_heavier_fighters:0 "Armoured for our Falcons"

 JER_bomber_f:0 "Bomber Experiments"
 JER_bomber_f_desc:0 "The impact of aerial warfare on the ground is not to be underestimated. Large aircraft can carry a payload of bombs that can obliterate an armoured column or even a factory! However, to strike with any measure of precision, we will have to do more than simply have passenger craft throw out bombs from the sky. We need specialised bomber planes."
 JER_strat_bomber_f:0 "Strategic Destruction"
 JER_strat_bomber_f_desc:0 "Smaller bombers can have an impact on a tactical scale, taking out a key enemy position or production facility. However, a war is rarely won in a single battle.

 JER_revolution_category:0 "The Second Revolution"
 JER_revolution_category_desc:0 "Shortly after the collapse of the Griffonian Empire the Kingdom of Aquileia experienced a revolution of its own.\n\nThe Revolution itself abolished the Discret Monarchy, and resulted in the proclamation of the First Aquileian Republic with Theodore Vérany at its head. Unfortunately, only five years after the Republic was created Marshal Berthelot led a counter-revolution which resulted in the Discret Restoration.\n\nIn spite of the Restoration there are still many within the country who refuse to let go of the dream of an Aquileian Republic thus making King Moriset's hold on the country tenuous at best."

The Baron himself was a Pirate lord for years before he was called to action by his family during the republican revolution. In the following years he asserted himself in a strong position politically by using the hyperloyal §GPony Minorities§! as a police force to control the city and influence his small army.\n\nDuring the revolution, §GPridea§! was under the control of §RThe Communards§! who formed the autonomous §RCommune of Pridea§!. Until §YBaron Dennis Discret§! sailed into the gulf of Pridea and shelled the city with his navy. After a brief urban land battle, the Pirate Lord announced himself Baron of the city in the name of the king. The communards and other republicans who got captured were taken to a now §Rinfamous wall§! next to the center of the old city where §Rthey were shot five by five§! until the Baron had run out of traitors to execute. \n\nIn the new year of 1007 §Rrevolutionary fervor§! is now spreading across Aquileia once more.

 JER_demand_tarrin_desc:0 "During the First Revolution, the Countess of Tarrin was deposed and executed by local republicans. However, the Count of Francistria, a distant relative of the Discrets and a claimant of Tarrin, intervened and opportunistically occupied the region. Ever since, Tarrin has been under foreign rule.\n\nThe time has finally come to liberate our brothers and sisters in Tarrin and drive out the oppressors of the east. We will send them an ultimatum, and if they do not accept, war is not out of the question."

 JER_sue_for_peace_desc:0 "We have overran Vinovia and secured Tarrin. While we could keep going and occupy the rest of Aquileia and force them to capitulate, perhaps it'd be better to end this bloodshed sooner rather than later."

 ### Events ###
 aquileia.1.t:0 "Divide and Conquer I: Michel and Dennis"
 aquileia.1.d:0 "It has recently come to our attentions that there are massive amounts of rebels and other miscreants hiding within the Barony of Pridea and the Duchy of Rila, and while we could support both of our vassals and help them deal with their respective situations before they escalate the King has decided to only help one in order to draw all the traitors to one spot."
 aquileia.1.a:0 "We'll help Michel with his issues"
 aquileia.1.b:0 "I always liked Dennis more"

 aquileia.2.t:0 "Centralisation"
 aquileia.2.d:0 "With the situation in Pridea growing more dire by the day, and with King Moriset pushing more and more funding into Rila we have been left in a truly odd spot. While the increased funding and military assistance from the rest of Aquileia has been instrumental in dealing with our own unrest it has left us woefully dependent on Aquileia proper, and left the title of Duke of Rila honorary for all intents and purposes. Perhaps we should just hand over the governorship of the Duchy back to the King?"
 aquileia.2.a:0 "Well... it was a good run"
 aquileia.2.b:0 "The Duke still does very important things!"

 aquileia.3.t:0 "The Return of the President"
 aquileia.3.d:0 "Chaos consumed the streets of Pridea today, as thousands of angry protesters and rebels stormed the Baron's Palace, and after striking Baron Dennis dead proclaimed a Pridean Republic. The rebels even had the audacity to proclaim the long exiled Théodore Vérany as president of Pridea, but for his part he has decided to remain in exile in New Manehattan."
 aquileia.3.a:0 "Viva la revolucion!"

 aquileia.4.t:0 "Centralisation"
 aquileia.4.d:0 "With the situation in Rila growing more dire by the day, and with King Moriset pushing more and more funding towards Pridea we have been left in a truly odd spot. While the increased funding and military assistance from the rest of Aquileia has been instrumental in dealing with our own unrest it has left us woefully dependent on Aquileia proper, and left the title of Baron of Pridea honorary for all intents and purposes. Perhaps we should just hand over the governorship of the Barony back to the King?"
 aquileia.4.a:0 "I'm sure Moriset will do well"
 aquileia.4.b:0 "The Baron still does important things!"

 aquileia.5.t:0 "The Rise of Communism"
 aquileia.5.d:0 "Chaos consumed the Duchy of Rila today as thousands of impoverished citizens took to the streets to protest. The protests quickly turned violent after a Ducal Guard shot one of the protesters, this action led to the eventual storming of the Ducal Palace, the death of the Duke and the proclamation of a Communist State under the leadership of Colonel Augustin Giraud... Needless to say it was an interesting turn of events."
 aquileia.5.a:0 "Workers of Rila unite!"

 aquileia.6.t:0 "Rebellion in Pridea"
 aquileia.6.d:0 "It seems that our plan of luring out the enemies of the state into one location has worked, the treacherous plebeians have risen up and taken over Pridea, now it is only a matter of crushing them."
 aquileia.6.a:0 "Time to deal with the traitors"
 aquileia.6.b:0 "Pridea is not important"

 aquileia.7.t:0 "Rebellion in Rila"
 aquileia.7.d:0 "It seems that our plan of luring out the enemies of the state into one location has worked, the treacherous workers of Rila have risen up and proclaimed a Socialist state in the former Duchy. Unfortunately for them they have reacted in the exact way we expected them to, now we just need to crush their little rebellion."
 aquileia.7.a:0 "Inform me when Rila is back in our claws"
 aquileia.7.b:0 "Just leave them be"

 aquileia.8.t:0 "Divide and Conquer II: The Twins and the Duke"
 aquileia.8.d:0 "It has recently come to our attentions that there are massive amounts of rebels and other miscreants hiding within Westkeep and the Duchy of Vinovia, and while we could most likely support all of our vassals and help them deal with their respective situations before they escalate the King has decided to only help one area in order to draw all the traitors hiding within the Northern Duchies to one spot."
 aquileia.8.a:0 "Uncle Gadiffer could use some help"
 aquileia.8.b:0 "Help Colette, I like her... tracts of land"

 aquileia.9.t:0 "Time Marches On"
 aquileia.9.d:0 "The Aquileian Marches are a dull and violent place, but King Moriset has offered to generously take over ruling them for us, perhaps we should accept his offer?"
 aquileia.9.a:0 "Finally"
 aquileia.9.b:0 "I've grown rather fond of this place"

 aquileia.10.t:0 "The Vinovian Republic"
 aquileia.10.d:0 "Chaos consumed the Duchy of Vinovia today, as thousands upon thousands of angry citizens stormed the Ducal Palace and killed the Duke, shortly after a Socialist Republic was proclaimed in the capital under the leadership of Cécile Gaudreau, the former Foreign Minister of the Aquileian Republic, who for her part has decided to return to Vinovia in an effort to at least fight the King."
 aquileia.10.a:0 "Long live the Republic!"

 aquileia.11.t:0 "The Vinovian Socialist Republic"
 aquileia.11.d:0 "It seems that our plan has finally succeeded, as Cécile Gaudreau and her followers have taken over Vinovia, and has managed to consolidate all the traitors in the Northern Duchies in one area in the process, all that remains now is to destroy their little Republic."
 aquileia.11.a:0 "Another day, another Republican dead"
 aquileia.11.b:0 "Who cares about Vinovia?"

 aquileia.12.t:0 "The End"
 aquileia.12.d:0 "It's been a good run, but the King's economic support of the Duchy has more or less destroyed what little autonomy we had in the first place, but perhaps if we beg hard enough he'll let us keep some autonomy."
 aquileia.12.a:0 "It was a good run"
 aquileia.12.b:0 "Time to beg... again"

 aquileia.14.t:0 "The Western Revolution"
 aquileia.14.d:0 "Chaos consumed the Westkeep today as both lordships were taken over by angry peasants and disgruntled workers."
 aquileia.14.a:0 "Long live the Revolution!"

 aquileia.15.t:0 "The Revolution Marches On"
 aquileia.15.d:0 "It seems that our strategy of drawing out the enemies of the state has once again worked, as thousands upon thousands of Communists have risen up in the Westkeep, all that we need to do now is march North and kill them all."
 aquileia.15.a:0 "March upon the Marches"
 aquileia.15.b:0 "The Marches aren't important"

 aquileia.16.t:0 "The Revolution"
 aquileia.16.d:0 "In a stunning display of boldness and élan, former exile Théodore Vérany returned to Aquileia, an army of Aquileian peasantry and formerly hidden supporters at his back, and stormed the Royal Palace, capturing the King and proclaiming the creation of the Second Aquileian Republic, as both the Aquileian Republican Army and Socialists fought the Aquileian military in the streets themselves. Time will tell what this means for the country, as it falls once again into bloodshed."
 aquileia.16.a:0 "Long live the Republic!"

 aquileia.17.t:0 "The Day of Reckoning"
 aquileia.17.d:0 "With the surrender of the Royalist forces in the old Aquileian military, the Republican victory was secured, and Monarchy was again abolished within the country. Having to decide what to do in regards to the deposed king, Vérany and his followers decided upon political irony, and sentenced the former king to death by the king’s preferred method of execution: the Guillotine. With his head firmly separated from his body, the King is quite dead, and with him, any hopes of monarchy in Aquileia."
 aquileia.17.a:0 "Sic semper tyranis"

 aquileia.18.t:0 "The Elections"
 aquileia.18.d:0 "With the Second Republic’s victory, the time has come for the important vote that will decide the political future of the feudal country. Everygriff has been incentivised to vote, and vote collectors are beginning to scour the countryside. The people of Aquileia have three major choices for head of state to choose from: Théodore Vérany, Hero Of both the First and the Second Aquileian Revolution, and running on the platform of free markets and liberal rights for each and every griffon. Cécile Gaudreau, of the Aquileian Worker’s Party- a moderate socialist looking to blend socialism and capitalism into a well-oiled and fluid state. Or, finally, Victor Allard- another influential member of the PAT and radical leftist, preaching purely socialist ideals, often times citing Stalliongradian methods in his public speeches."
 aquileia.18.a:0 "FJA retains a majority and Théodore Vérany remains president!"
 aquileia.18.b:0 "PAT-M gains a majority under Cécile Gaudreau!"
 aquileia.18.c:0 "PAT-R gains a majority under Victor Allard!"

 aquileia.19.t:0 "The Loose Ends"
 aquileia.19.d:0 "In a grimly political move, the current government swiftly and methodically dealt with what it felt were several loose ends within the PAT, as agents of the Aquileian government were reported to execute potentially hostile elements in their perceived opposition. Notables include several political and military advisory Griffons for the government, as well as Field Marshall Victor Moreau who was shot, and General Félix Murat, who was reportedly poisoned."
 aquileia.19.a:0 "Another threat to the establishment dealt with"

 aquileia.20.t:0 "The New Republic"
 aquileia.20.d:0 "With his political victory secure, Victor Allard proclaimed the formation of the Aquileian People’s Republic today, and announced several relatively fast reformation plans for the country, as he solidifies his new government. Decrying the Capitalist Bourgeoisie as Monarchist Shills, Allard has spoken out radically against liberal as Monarchist forms of government, proclaiming that Socialism is the proper way forward for the country."
 aquileia.20.a:0 "It's good to be the General Secretary"

 aquileia.21.t:0 "The Exile of Victor Allard"
 aquileia.21.d:0 "In a shocking move today, the PAT and FJA came together in the government to publicly disavow and declare Persona-Non-grata Victor Allard, a formerly major influence within the PAT, and radical socialist. Personally disgusted with the turn of events, and wanting nothing else to do with politics, Allard left the country today in self-imposed Exile, to whereabouts unknown."
 aquileia.21.a:0 "Another threat to the establishment dealt with"

 aquileia.22.t:0 "A New Republic"
 aquileia.22.d:0 "Today marks a historic day in Aquileian history. Building upon their success during the Revolution and learned lessons during our political times of turmoil, the Democratic government has announced the gradual reform of our government into a proper Federated Republic, as a Republic is more capable than a direct democracy, without threatening the voice of the average Griffon."
 aquileia.22.a:0 "Long live the Federation!"

 aquileia.23.t:0 "An Invitation to the Entente"
 aquileia.23.d:0 "It seems that the Aquileians being quite proud of their new Republic have decided to invite us into something called the Entente - apparently it is intended to be an alliance of Democracies in Griffonian, and would provide both financial and military assistance to all members. Should we join?"
 aquileia.23.a:0 "We will join"
 aquileia.23.b:0 "We don't need the Aquileians"

 aquileia.24.t:0 "Skyfall Accepts"
 aquileia.24.d:0 "Skyfall has accepted our invitation"
 aquileia.24.a:0 "Wonderful"

 aquileia.25.t:0 "Skyfall Refuses"
 aquileia.25.d:0 "Skyfall has declined our invitation"
 aquileia.25.a:0 "Oh bollocks"

 aquileia.26.t:0 "An Invitation to the Entente"
 aquileia.26.d:0 "It seems that the Aquileians being quite proud of their new Republic have decided to invite us into something called the Entente - apparently it is intended to be an alliance of Democracies in Griffonian, and would provide both financial and military assistance to all members. Should we join?"
 aquileia.26.a:0 "Why not?"
 aquileia.26.b:0 "We don't need the Aquileians"

 aquileia.27.t:0 "The Republic Accepts"
 aquileia.27.d:0 "The Griffonian Republic has accepted"
 aquileia.27.a:0 "Wonderful!"

 aquileia.28.t:0 "The Republic Declines"
 aquileia.28.d:0 "The Griffonian Republic had declined"
 aquileia.28.a:0 "Bollocks"

 aquileia.29.t:0 "The Fate of the Kingdom"
 aquileia.29.d:0 "Upon the insistence of Marshal Rodier, a strict Ultranationalist dedicated to all things Aquileian, the king must now decide whether to stand firm and remain the absolute monarch of Aquileia, to whom all power resides, or to allow the Marshal and his cronies into the government as a prime minister, supposedly to provide support for the king whilst calming the Ultranationalists in government."
 aquileia.29.a:0 "The Maréchal has some interesting ideas"
 aquileia.29.b:0 "The King's rule is absolute"

 aquileia.30.t:0 "The Death of Marshal Berthelot"
 aquileia.30.d:0 "Marshal Berthelot, the Griffon most responsible for the destruction of the First Aquileian Republic and the restoration of Moriset Discret to the throne of Aquileia passed away today at the age of 87. The old Marshal was found dead in his manor in Vyzima by one of his servants, a quick examination proved that Berthelot had passed away naturally and a funeral procession was organised by his family and friends. Although Berthelot is seen as a hero by some Aquileians the majority of our people considered him a scoundrel and a lackey of the Discret family, thus making both him and his death a deeply dividing matter."
 aquileia.30.b:0 "Rest in peace... old friend"

 aquileia.31.t:0 "The Night of Glass"
 aquileia.31.d:0 "Around midnight, members of Garde d'Aquileia and members of the Royal Guard stormed Equestrian districts all around Aquileia. Stallions, mares, foals none were spared the violence, hundreds if not thousands were killed, homes were burnt to ash, temples ransacked and businesses smashed, those who did not flee were either lynched by those whom mere days before they called neighbours and friends, or arrested and dragged off into the night, their fates forever unknown to the world. Perhaps more shocking than this display of violence were the shocking "disappearances" of several ministers whom were opposed to the MPA and their ultranationalist views... needless to say this day will go down in infamy."
 aquileia.31.a:0 "A Lesson to the enemies of Aquileia"

 aquileia.32.t:0 "The Grand Coup"
 aquileia.32.d:0 "It happened too fast for anyone to even react, as akin to clockwork members of the Garde d'Aquileia and MPA sympathisers within the Aquileian military armed themselves and took to the streets, around both the Aquileian cities and the countryside all major roads were blocked, any strategic checkpoints taken, police stations occupied. Soon thereafter King Moriset found himself under house arrest, thus without shedding a drop of Aquileian blood the Maréchal and his cronies had taken over the Government."
 aquileia.32.a:0 "Long Live the Maréchal"

 aquileia.33.t:0 "The Fate of the King"
 aquileia.33.d:0 "With King Moriset under house arrest, we must decide what we are to do with the pitiful bird. While not popular by any means, King Discret is still a political figurehead, as he is the head of the state and legitimate government. Should we have him shot, which will undoubtedly anger the monarchists in government, should we marginalise him into nothing but a simple figure head, or should we Exile him from the country completely?"
 aquileia.33.a:0 "Kill the idiot"
 aquileia.33.b:0 "Marginalise the King"
 aquileia.33.c:0 "Exile the King"

 aquileia.39.t:0 "The Maréchal Leaves"
 aquileia.39.d:0 "To the surprise of many, Marshal Rodier whom up until recently had been rather receptive of the new Republican Government has decided to leave Aquileia, apparently the Marshal declared the MPA a failed organisation and Aquileia a dead nation, and left for the Griffonian Empire, what he will do next is anyone's guess."
 aquileia.39.a:0 "Good Riddance"
 
 aquileia.41.t:0 "The Pascal Affair"
 aquileia.41.d:0 "The Republic is gripped with suspicion and paranoia as an artillery officer within our fair republic's army was placed under arrested, having been suspected of sending letters to correspondents within the Empire! To think that one of our fair citizens would attempt to exchange information and secrets with the power-hungry despots in Griffenheim is horrifying and almost unbelievable! There in lies the problem however, independent investigations have concluded that Pascal was not sending these letters, after interviewing his fellow officers as well as his own family. They considered him a "True Patriot to the Republic, and would give his life for it." Many suspect that the Policegriffons sent to arrest him placed these false documents within his home, and that these Griffons were agents of the MPA, hoping to stir up anti-pony sentiment. Whatever the case may be, all Ponies within the republic are to be closely watched now."
 aquileia.41.a:0 "These are not our republican ideals!"

 JER_commie_army_desc:0 "Our old army was pathetic at best, and useless at worst. If we are to secure our government for good and keep ourselves and our people safe, we must form a new army- and quickly."
 JER_communists:0 "The Dictatorship of the Proletariat"
 JER_communists_desc:0 "Our country is making great strides- and we shall continue these strides. Of the people, for the people, shall be our motto and our means to an end.

We, above all else, shall be a true worker's paradise, free from the shackles of Capitalist societies and their outdatedness."
 JER_education_soc:0 "Education Reforms"
 JER_education_soc_desc:0 "If we are to begin converting our populace to the wonders of Socialism, we must first begin educating the masses, so as to help them understand why our Socialist state is superior to the Monarchy of old, and to bring up smarter, more well-informed Griffons."
 JER_education_soc_finish:0 "A Communist Education"
 JER_education_soc_finish_desc:0 "We must finish our education reforms as quickly as possible, to help to bring forth the new Socialist Griffon. While we have already made good strides in educating the illiterate masses, we must finish the re-education campaign, pulling ourselves up kicking and screaming by our bootstraps if we must."
 JER_griffonian_revolution:0 "A New Revolution"
 JER_griffonian_revolution_desc:0 "Our own revolution is complete, however, across Griffonia, the people still find themselves oppressed under the heels of Monarchists and dictators. Our revolution has ended, but the revolution to free the continent of Griffonia is only just beginning."

 JER_final_battle:0 "A Flame the Ages Shall Not Extinguish"
 JER_final_battle_desc:0 "It is time to strike against the most glaring voice of dissent against our way of life; the most vile of states, the old Griffon Empire. A pathetic shrivelled shadow of what it once was, the Empire needs to be fully crushed again, never to return."
 JER_election_moderates:0 "A Victory for the Moderates"
 JER_election_moderates_desc:0 "In a fair democratic election, we have won a great victory for socialism. However, our work cannot stop there. We still have much to do, and little time with which to do it."
 JER_election_moderates:0 "Resource Nationalisation"
 JER_election_moderates_desc:0 "One of our first steps toward a proper and free socialist state is to nationalise the resources away from the monopolistic companies of the old regime. Whilst we should still promote businesses by value of keeping a limited and controlled market, we should still give out incentives to boost productivity and keep people interested in investing into our resource networks."
 JER_national_industry:0 "Limited Nationalisation"
 JER_national_industry_desc:0 "Building upon our earlier incentives towards limited markets, we should, in some capacity, nationalise our industrial sector. While there will be some privatisation still, as that is conducive to keeping investors interested and therefore keeping our technology up to date, we should place ideal restrictions upon some industries to prevent Capitalistic or Monopolistic tendencies from running rampant."
 JER_reconcile_with_archon:0 "Reconcile With the Clergy"
 JER_reconcile_with_archon_desc:0 "While the new Socialist Griffon does not have a need for the old ways of religion, we should not go out of our way to antagonise the clergy, considering that they still have a wide base of support amongst all parties in our new republic. Ergo, we should make amends, so as to keep civil discourse between our two groups, and to appease the people. In the end, it is up to them, after all, to decide whether the old ways will survive or die."
 JER_education:0 "Free Education"
 JER_education_desc:0 "Before the introduction of the Republic, Education was only for the wealthy and Bourgeoisie noble classes. If we are to continue forward with our Republic, we must address this issue, and quickly."
 JER_bernie_sanders:0 "Free Healthcare"
 JER_bernie_sanders_desc:0 "One of our first steps towards a free and proper, modern socialist state should be to provide the masses with free health care. In doing this, we ensure every Griffon's future at a low expense, and we will be able to also garner a wider base of support, as people will feel thankful for the free aid."
 JER_militia_army:0 "An Army of Militias"
 JER_militia_army_desc:0 "While not the most orthodox or centralised military, our new militia model army will be one to be respected.

 JER_the_republic:0 "Reclaim the Old Borders"

 JER_partisans_effort:0 "No Surrender"
 JER_partisans_effort_desc:0 "There shall be not one step backwards! We must defend our lands to the end, whether in victory or in defeat, but we shall be forever remembered as the staunchest of defenders, unwilling to give up a single scrap of open ground to our enemies. Each inch shall be fought over as if it were a mile, and each mile, as if it were a city."
 JER_infrasctructure_project:0 "Railroad Projects"
 JER_infrasctructure_project_desc:0 "The steam powered locomotive is truly the way forward into the modern era. As such, we should invest in this method of transportation, to truly prove to the world how far we have come, and how far we can, in the future, go."
 JER_industry_buildup:0 "Industrial Buildup"
 JER_industry_buildup_desc:0 "With our new state-backed railroad networks in place, we should also see about hooking them up to our industrial base. Ergo, we must build up new infrastructure and industry to benefit this, and to set a precedent for future industrial endeavours."
 JER_industry_projects:0 "State Armouries"
 JER_industry_projects_desc:0 "In addition to industrial and infrastructure reforms and advances, we should also take some time to set up some state-backed armouries for a few local militias. This should ease the burdens on our armaments organisers, and help to better equip our militias for any current or future conflicts they must partake in."
 JER_election_democracy:0 "A Victory for Freedom"
 JER_election_democracy_desc:0 "We have won a fair and just democratic victory! Despite worries about our socialist brethren that aided us in our struggles, Democracy has prevailed. It is now time to focus on our new country; our new Republic."
 JER_government_unity:0 "Form a Coalition Government"
 JER_government_unity_desc:0 "While our Socialist brothers were defeated in a fair democratic election, we cannot alienate and isolate them from government. Instead, we must offer them the olive branch of peace, and form a joint FJA-PAT coalition as our governmental institution. This will not only garner us a wide support base, but will also help to soothe tensions between us and the PAT."
 JER_federation:0 "The Aquileian Federated Republic"
 JER_federation_desc:0 "Now that we have secured our internal standing, we must look outwards to the Republic's former border states. Now, we must decide how we are going to deal with said states, which are tellingly still shackled by their tyrannical monarchs and feudalistic rulers."
 JER_federal_reserve:0 "Form the Federal Reserve"
 JER_federal_reserve_desc:0 "We need to form a backable and sustainable reserve of funds for public works projects, that we can draw upon for future works, such as industrial reforms or infrastructural projects. Forming a national bank and national reserve would be an excellent first step for this."
 JER_outer_states:0 "The Outer Republics"
 JER_outer_states_desc:0 "It is time to reintegrate our border states into proper Republican states within our Federated Republic. To do this, however, will take a fight of it's own, as there is little doubt the Monarchists will fight tooth and nail to keep their power to themselves, and out of the talons of their people."
 JER_entente:0 "Allies on the Homefront"

 JER_final_preperations_desc:0 "The time is nearly here to end Feudalistic Tyranny upon our home continent of Griffonia, by striking at the black heart of the Empire to our North. Before we can do that, however, we must make our final preparations to bring ourselves to a full war footing with the coming foe. If we are unready, then we shall surely lose. Nothing can be left to chance."
 JER_education_fixing:0 "Every Griffon an Education"
 JER_education_fixing_desc:0 "Every Griffon, be they Nobility or the common Griffon, deserves the right to a fair and full education. As we are now in a position to promote this, we must make good on our political promises and do so, so that we may bring ourselves into a new age of enlightenment."
 JER_industry_construction:0 "Industrial Projects"

 JER_the_plot_desc:0 "Regardless of our Socialist allies' pledges of allegiance, there are clearly some elements of the far left that refuse to fall in line with our ideals, despite our victory over them in the election.

 JER_paramilitary:0 "Legalise the Garde d'Aquileia"
 JER_paramilitary_desc:0 "The Garde d'Aquileia, once regarded by leftists and rogue elements as a terrorist organisation, is now to be made a legal institution.

 JER_target_kings_men:0 "Target the King's Men"
 JER_target_kings_men_desc:0 "The king still has eyes and ears, and political allies everywhere in our government. Before we are able to move forward with our plans, we must find these men, and deal with them as quietly and as quickly as possible."
 JER_crytal_night:0 "The Night of Glass"
 JER_crytal_night_desc:0 "For years, we have been plagued by radicals and Equestrian undesirables. Now, it is time to uproot and remove those people.

 JER_fascist_coup:0 "A Patriotic Coup"

 JER_conscription_reform_desc:0 "A strong national state needs a suitably strong national military, and it is now time for us to implement this. Every capable griffon shall serve in the military for a limited term, and incentives shall be provided to those who are willing to stay for subsequent terms, or enlist on their own rather than being drafted."
 JER_new_generals:0 "A New Generation of Officers"
 JER_new_generals_desc:0 "With a new generation of state and military, must come a new generation of officers. No longer can we rely on old and outdated officers and their equally outdated tactics, but a new way of warfare, waged by a new breed of soldier and officer, must come about."

 JER_absolute_rule:0 "The King's Country"

 JER_old_borders:0 "Lay claim to the Northern Duchies"

 JER_commie_industry:0 "The Five Year Plan"
 JER_commie_industry_desc:0 "With our political victories secured, we must take care to develop our horridly outdated industrial sector.

 JER_mechainsed_agriculture:0 "Mechanise Agriculture"

 JER_destroyers_desc:0 "As with the olden days, small, lightning-quick vessels capable of swooping in and blasting away any merchant vessels, then escaping before the enemy is able to realise what has happened to them, is paramount to our goals.

 JER_mobile_army:0 "Une Armée Rapide"
 JER_mobile_army_desc:0 "The key to winning a war is to be the fastest into and out of battle, and our army should reflect that. Our troops must be motorised and mechanised, capable of crossing large expanses in a few hours that would take a conventional army days or weeks."
 JER_army_support:0 "Integrated Support Companies"
 JER_army_support_desc:0 "To further streamline and professionalise our military, we should integrate our new support battalions into proper companies, intermingled throughout the front line forces. This will allow us to quickly respond with necessary units, regardless of the situation at hand."
 JER_special_forces:0 "Les forces spéciales"
 JER_special_forces_desc:0 "In addition to the standard professionalisation of our military, we should develop a program dedicated to special units, capable of tackling more specialised and dangerous operations that a normal and average soldier would balk at. To this end, we have begun establishing a dedicated Special Operations Command, to provide training for these soldiers."
 JER_armored_shit:0 "Armoured Breakthroughs"
 JER_armored_shit_desc:0 "With our focus on rapid advance and motorisation of the military, we should therefore develop dedicated armoured units, comprised of these newfangled 'tanks', to support their advance. More heavily armoured, but still more rapid than foot infantry, we can therefore use these units to break open an enemy line before the infantry rolls on through."
 JER_motorized_equipment:0 "Mass Motorisation"
 JER_motorized_equipment_desc:0 "If we are to truly mobilise our military, we must develop and produce a standardised troop transport, capable of achieving high speeds during an advance, and also capable of carrying large amounts of soldiers into battle."
 JER_superior_equipment:0 "Superior Equipment"
 JER_superiour_equipment_desc:0 "Our Equipment, much like our military, must also be superior and more elite than anything that our enemies throw at us, so as to strike fear into their hearts, and provide us a better means to carry the day, and win the battle- and eventually the war."
 JER_armoured_production:0 "Armoured Production"
 JER_armoured_production_desc:0 "We must continue to crank out tanks and motorised troop transports as quickly as possible; the more the merrier, and the more guns and troops we can bring to bear upon the enemy, the greater our chances of seizing victory."
 JER_new_airforce:0 "A New Air Force"
 JER_new_airforce_desc:0 "We must modernise our aerial combat with these new 'aircraft' inventions, as rapidly as possible. The best way to begin this is to create new airports for said planes."
 JER_bombers:0 "Bomber Designs"
 JER_bombers_desc:0 "We should design a model of bomber, capable of dropping explosives on our enemies from longer ranges than artillery can reach."
 JER_fighters:0 "Fighter Designs"
 JER_fighters_desc:0 "We must develop new fighter plane designs, so as to keep our edge in the air, and to increase our pilots' odds of success in dogfights."
 JER_better_doctrine:0 "A Better Doctrine"
 JER_better_doctrine_desc:0 "Now that we've got some experience in aerial matters, we should see about developing a more proper aerial doctrine that our pilots are able to follow."
 JER_strategic_bomber:0 "Long Range Bombers"
 JER_strategic_bomber_desc:0 "Whilst our tactical bombers are excellent for supporting our troops on the front, we should develop a larger, more powerful bomber model that is capable of reaching far into enemy territory, bringing the fight directly to their front doors."
 JER_close_air:0 "Close Air Support"
 JER_close_air_desc:0 "Our bomber models are good at supporting the troops at the front, however, this was not the intention behind their original design. We should develop a type of fighter air craft that is dedicated to close support of our troops on the front line, regardless of situation."
 JER_airbases_2:0 "New Airbases"
 JER_airbases_2_desc:0 "With our expanding air force, we should also expand the locations capable of holding and preparing our fighters and bombers for their next sorties."
 JER_at_long_last_the_final_one:0 "Not a Single Tree Standing"
 JER_at_long_last_the_final_one_desc:0 "We shall eradicate any and all enemies of ours through sheer weight of ordinance, and bomb our enemies so far into submission that by the time our bombers have returned home from their sortie, there is not a single tree left standing for our enemies to hide behind."
 JER_resource_nationalisation:0 "Resource Nationalisation"
 JER_resource_nationalisation_desc:0 "The first of many steps for our newly established administration, the state will commit the seizure of deposits of valuable metals. The state will promise that these metals will be wisely used to ensure the protection of our citizens."

Unfortunately, only five years after the Republic was created Marshal Berthelot led a counter-revolution which resulted in the Discret Restoration.\n\n In spite of the Restoration there are still many within the country who refuse to let go of the dream of an Aquileian Republic thus making King Moriset's hold on the country tenuous at best."

aquileia_news.1.t:0 "The Second Aquileian Revolution"
aquileia_news.1.d:0 "The Kingdom of Aquileia, for the second time in recent history, is embroiled in revolutionary turmoil, the so called Second Aquileian Revolution. Republican and Communist supporters have managed to quickly overwhelm, apprehend or eliminate the loyalist forces within the Country itself, with even King Moriset Discret himself having been captured and thrown into the Dungeon.\n\nThe Republic is fiercely opposed by the surrounding Dukes and Barons, who have sworn to destroy the revolutionary Spirit once and for all. Under the Leadership of Théodore Vérany, the Republic braces itself for the coming storm, ready to defend their ideals and values to the Death. For the second Time in History, there is bloodshed in Aquileia."

After much bloodshed and many atrocities, the Region is once again at Peace, with the Republic now firmly in place.\n\nThe Future of the Republic remains uncertain, however, as the temporary alliance of Communists and Republicans breaks apart in the light of the upcoming first General Election. The Aquileians and the World around them now ask themselves what the future holds for the Republic."

The former vassals of the Kingdom have defeated the revolutionary Army and captured many leaders of the Republic. It is expected that, just like with the first Aquileian Republic, a family member of the Discret Dynasty is to be placed on the throne, and that the Kingdom will once again be restored in the light of an unsuccessful Revolution."

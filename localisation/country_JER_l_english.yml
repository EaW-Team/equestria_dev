 JER_memories_desc:0 "Shortly after the collapse of the Griffonian Empire the Kingdom of Aquileia experienced a revolution of its own.\n\nThe Revolution itself abolished the Discret Monarchy, and resulted in the proclamation of the First Aquileian Republic with Théodore Vérany at its head. Unfortunately, only five years after the Republic was created Marshal Berthelot led a counter-revolution which resulted in the Discret Restoration.\n\nIn spite of the Restoration there are still many within the country who refuse to let go of the dream of an Aquileian Republic thus making King Moriset's hold on the country tenuous at best."

 ### Events ###
 aquileia.1.t:0 "Weapons From The Capital"
 aquileia.1.d:0 "A large delivery of weapons has come from Aquila, courtesy of the royal armoury. With revolutionary tensions rising, these weapons likely will be invaluable in the coming months."
 aquileia.1.a:0 "Magnifique!"
 
 aquileia.2.t:0 "The Chouette Raids"
 aquileia.2.d:0 "The secret police has been on the move recently. Through their usual methods - unsavory as they are - they have revealed several revolutionary headquarters and raided them in the middle of the night. Hopefully, this will be enough to thwart the rebels."
 aquileia.2.a:0 "This will force the rats into the open..."
 
 aquileia.3.t:0 "The Pony March"
 aquileia.3.d:0 "A grand march through the countryside took place this week. Ponies, numbering in the thousands, marched from Pelis to Rila, holding royal banners and placards with pro-royalist slogans on them. In every village they passed more ponies join them, and as they reached Rila they filled the city square, singing the Royal Hymn and declaring their loyalty to the crown."
 aquileia.3.a:0 "Glad to see our Equine friends are still supporting us"
 
 aquileia.4.t:0 "Republicans Within the MPA Arrested"
 aquileia.4.d:0 "It seems that the local MPA have had greater issues than we suspected. The Chouette, acting on orders from Aquila, arrested over a dozen high ranking MPA members on charges of revolutionary activities."
 aquileia.4.a:0 "How Embarrassing"
 
 aquileia.5.t:0 "A Visit to Vinovia"
 aquileia.5.d:0 "Vinovia has been graced by the presence of the royal family. With tensions high, many had feared that a visit from the tempramental king would only make things worse, but thankfully the visitor turned out to be princess Vivienne. The princess, as charming as any griffin could be, took her time with both commoner and noble and was all smiles and delight. Even with the possibility of revolution ahead, for one evening the princess managed to assuage fears and give a moment of joy to all."
 aquileia.5.a:0 "Thank Eyr Moriset sent Vivienne instead..."
 
 aquileia.6.t:0 "Letting Loose"
 aquileia.6.d:0 "So the revolutionary rats have crawled out of their holes again to make a mess of things, have they? Well, if they did not learn the last time, it seems we will have to teach them a lesson again. Let's make sure we are suitably excessive this time around."
 aquileia.6.a:0 "Violence solves most things"
 
 aquileia.7.t:0 "Search And Destroy"
 aquileia.7.d:0 "Pridean forces have struck all over Pridea, dragging the traitors and their sympathisers out of their holes kicking and screaming. The citizens are too afraid to defy us, knowing the price of treason, and by the time we're done there will not be a single rat left in all of Pridea!"
 aquileia.7.a:0 "None can hide from us!"
 
 aquileia.8.t:0 "Friends In the MPA"
 aquileia.8.d:0 "It seems the MPA have been receiving aid from Aquila. That's splendid news as it means that there's more fighters out there, willing to fight for Aquileia. "
 aquileia.8.a:0 "Magnifique"
 
 aquileia.9.t:0 "Rila Holds"
 aquileia.9.d:0 "The revolutionaries came, and the revolutionaries failed. They thought they could break Rila, but it broke them instead. Raise the royal banner high, Rila Holds!"
 aquileia.9.a:0 "Hurray!"
 
 aquileia.10.t:0 "The Revolution in Rila"
 aquileia.10.d:0 "Early in the morning, at 5 am, a group of red-wearing Cocardiers, followed by a mob of angry griffons stormed into the richer districts of Rila, pulling out of the buildings large amounts of wealthy noblegriffs—the latter coming out of their homes in chains, bound by the revolutionaries, and were forced to beg for their lives in front of a quickly growing crowd. Barely an hour later, they had been mercilessly butchered by the angry mob before their bodies were eventually thrown into the river under the cheers of the mob.\n\nMere moments later, the most charismatic member of the Cocardiers rallied the crowd with a roaring speech, proposing to march on the ducal palace, its speech was met with booming encouragement and applause, and the ever-growing crowd prepared to advance towards the palace, all the while chanting 'Ah! Ca ira!'. On their way, they were joined by nearby passersby and even members of the National Guard, arming themselves with what they could take from the streets of the city, the revolutionary crowd, easily numbering in the thousands, prepared themselves for a bloody fight against the palace guards.\n\nHowever, their arrival at the palace was met with a shocking lack of resistance, no royalist forces intercepted them, nor were there any troublemakers opposing their advance, as a matter of fact, their strength only grew; the guards at the gate of the Duke's palace offered no resistance whatsoever, instead, simply opening it before retreating back inside the building itself. Assuring themselves that this was a trap, the crowd angrily roared from behind the gates and were about to start throwing rocks and shooting bullets at the windows before they were all quieted down by a loud shout from the Duke itself.\n\Duke Michel walked out of the palace onto his balcony, and dozens of rifles were immediately pointed in his direction, tracing his exact steps. The crowd held their breath as he looked down upon the crowd, he took a steady step back, before he suddenly brought up a blue, white, and red flag from under him, shouting 'Vive la Révolution!', to the mob's surprise. The crowd as a whole instantly broke into cheers, with several griffons even daring to shout 'Vive le Duc Michel!' back at him.\n\nThings are still chaotic elsewhere, and the road ahead is long, but with the Jewel of the North in the claws of the revolutionaries, it is clear that the first great step towards liberty has been taken."
 aquileia.10.a:0 "Vive la Révolution!"
 
 aquileia.11.t:0 "Monarchist MPA Coup"
 aquileia.11.d:0 "The revolutionaries had sunk their claws deep into Westkeep, but early this morning the loyalist MPA launched a counter-coup, securing the capitol and declaring their intent to stand by the King."
 aquileia.11.a:0 "Long live the Discrets!"
 
 aquileia.12.t:0 "The Revolution in Westkeep"
 aquileia.12.d:0 "The MPA are patriots, but that means they believe in Aquileia, not the Discrets. Westkeep has declared for the revolution. It is time to throw down these old tyrants and free the people of Aquileia."
 aquileia.12.a:0 "For the Revolution and the Aquileian people!"
 
 aquileia.13.t:0 "Vinovia Holds"
 aquileia.13.d:0 "It seemed like disaster might strike, but in the end, the Duke's leadership has seen us through, and the revolutionaries have failed in their objectives. Despite the chaos in the streets, all reports say that the loylaist forces are driving them back and the rightful order remains intact."
 aquileia.13.a:0 "As if there was ever any doubt"
 
 aquileia.14.t:0 "The Revolution in Vinovia"
 aquileia.14.d:0 "Down with the tyrants! Our forces have secured the Ducal palace and the outlying regions of the capitol. Raise high the banner of Vinovia and march forth! We march for freedom, to victory!"
 aquileia.14.a:0 "For the Revolution and the Vinovian people!"
 
 aquileia.15.t:0 "Pridea Holds"
 aquileia.15.d:0 "Despite the efforts of the traitors and revolutionaries, Pridea remains loyal to the crown. They tried their best, but it was all for naught, and it seems we are dragging more traitors to the wall again."
 aquileia.15.a:0 "Magnifique!"
 
 aquileia.16.t:0 "The Revolution"
 aquileia.16.d:0 "In a stunning display of boldness and élan, former exile Théodore Vérany returned to Aquileia, an army of Aquileian peasantry and formerly hidden supporters at his back, and stormed the Royal Palace, capturing the King and proclaiming the creation of the Second Aquileian Republic, as both the Aquileian Republican Army and Socialists fought the Aquileian military in the streets themselves. Time will tell what this means for the country, as it falls once again into bloodshed."
 aquileia.16.a:0 "Long live the Republic!"
 
 aquileia.17.t:0 "The Triumphant Revolution"
 aquileia.17.d:0 "It has been a long and bloody road, but today, the last of the monarchist vassals has finally collapsed beneath the unstoppable tide of freedom! Thanks to widespread and organized revolutionary fervor and the countless valiant sacrifices of so many griffons, the supporters of the old monarchy have been crushed, and the lineage of the Discrets scattered to the winds. Even the officers that once begrudgingly fought beneath the banners of cruelty and tyranny have been swayed by our cause, and have pledged their undying support to the new republic. They will safeguard Aquileia from the return of the Discrets, as surely the taint of their royal blood lingers in bastards across Griffonia, but with their help, Aquileia is free, and a new day dawns on us and our new republic!"
 aquileia.17.a:0 "Long live the Republic!"
 
 aquileia.18.t:0 "The Triumphant Revolution"
 aquileia.18.d:0 "It has been a long and bloody road, but today, the last of the monarchist vassals has finally collapsed beneath the unstoppable tide of freedom! Thanks to widespread and organized revolutionary fervor and the countless valiant sacrifices of so many griffons, the supporters of the old monarchy have been crushed, and the lineage of the Discrets scattered to the winds. Though our enemies fought on to the bitter end, they have all been defeated on the field of battle, their armies crushed and routed. A new generation of heroes will safeguard Aquileia from those that would see the monarchy restored yet again, but with their help, Aquileia is free, and a new day dawns on us and our new republic!""
 aquileia.18.a:0 "Long live the Republic!"
 
 aquileia.19.t:0 "A Few Missing Rifles"
 aquileia.19.d:0 "The quartermaster walked through the depot, a clipboard clutched in one claw. "Twenty-four new artillery pieces," she murmured to herself, counting out the new cannons and scratching a note in the clipboard. "Fifty mortar tubes and grenades... check. Replacement rifle parts... check."\n\nShe hummed to herself as all the numbers on her charts added up. So far, so good. She prided herself on taking good notes, and not having a mishap in her depot since her posting. "Let's count the guns, then I can get some tea with Louis..."\n\nIt was always the chore she saved for last. Not only did she have to count the crates, but the factories never rigorously checked how many rifles they put in the crates, so sometimes her numbers could be off. Even years after the revolution had been crushed, not all of Aquileia's wheels turned smoothly.\n\n"...forty-six, forty-seven, forty-eight... forty-eight?" She counted the crates again. "There were supposed to be fifty crates..." Maybe the factories had crammed more guns into the crates to save wood? But after spending an hour cracking open crates and counting their contents, the quartermaster had no answer for the missing guns.\n\nShe'd have to report this to her higher ups. Lunch with Louis would have to wait."
 aquileia.19.a:0 "Quite odd wouldn't you say?"
 
 aquileia.20.t:0 "Gone Like The Wind"
 aquileia.20.d:0 "The spymaster general dug his claws into his skull. The reports kept rolling in, one after the other. It seemed like every revolutionary cell in the kingdom had simply disappeared overnight, their members gone with the wind. Some of his spies believed that the cells had simply given up the fight, but he knew better. They wouldn't all disperse in unison. They had to be planning something. But there were dozens of cells with hundreds of griffons that his spies were keeping track of. Now, not a one could be found. Where did they all go?!"
 aquileia.20.a:0 "Now where did they go off to?"
 
 aquileia.21.t:0 "Assistance From The MPA"
 aquileia.21.d:0 "With revolutionary sentiment growing throughout the kingdom once more, griffons have been organizing and gathering in secret and making demonstrations in public. Unrest grows by the day, but stability and order is coming from an unexpected source: the fascists of the Mouvement Patriote d'Aquileia. The fascists are very organized and well-equipped, and they have lent our gendarmeries a helping claw in keeping unrest suppressed. Thanks to their help, our police force can focus on more pressing matters, like rooting out all the revolutionaries we can find and piling their heads beneath the guillotine!"
 aquileia.21.a:0 "That's rather generous of them?"
 
 aquileia.22.t:0 "Increased Chouette Activity"
 aquileia.22.d:0 "Recent days have seen the Chouette, the secret police that serve as King Moriset's right claw, increase their presence and visibility throughout the kingdom, breaking down the doors of suspected revolutionaries in the middle of the night and publicly executing them by day. In this day and age, no griffon is safe from being a suspected sympathizer of the revolution, and the Chouette have taken it upon themselves to sort the matter out once and for all."
 aquileia.22.a:0 "How strange"
 
 aquileia.23.t:0 "Support From the Capital"
 aquileia.23.d:0 "With revolutionary sentiment rising throughout the Kingdom of Aquileia, several companies of soldiers and additional support for our gendarmerie arrived today to bolster our numbers, bearing official papers signed by the king himself. These extra griffons will help keep an eye out for any rebel organizations in our lands, and are already swiftly being integrated into our local gendarmeries and briefed on the current situation."
 aquileia.23.a:0 "That's absolutely grand!"
 
 aquileia.24.t:0 "The Fire Rises"
 aquileia.24.d:0 "Private Noelle stared at the growing mound of papers gathering in the gendarmerie station. The police had been bringing them in all day, with griffons constantly coming and going ever since the sun rose that morning. She was barely literate and struggled to read out the words on the pamphlet clutched in her talons, but the revolutionary tricolour was easy enough to see. She needed no script to know what that meant.\n\n"Find the printers that helped them make these," her sergeant grumbled, tearing a pamphlet in half out of frustration. "Better yet, just arrest all the printers in the city. We can't have anymore pamphlets on the streets, you understand?"\n\nNoelle saluted in acknowledgement. "It will be done, sir," she said, and then quickly slipped out of the station at his dismissal. But even as she stepped outside, she saw a pair of griffons down the street snatching two pamphlets off the ground and tucking them into their overcoats. Arresting all the printers in Pridea might put a pause to new pamphlets being spread, but once words put an idea in a griffons head, it was notoriously hard to shake out.\n\nPerhaps for the first time in her life, Noelle was glad she couldn't read."
 aquileia.24.a:0 "If only more of our subjects were illiterate"
 
 aquileia.25.t:0 "Murders Most Foul"
 aquileia.25.d:0 "Ever since King Moriset returned from Zebrica and reclaimed the Aquileian throne, those that supported him have been rewarded with better postings and better pay all throughout the kingdom. Perhaps this is not more evident than in the Barony of Pridea, where ponies that collaborated with the king and Marshal Berthelot have climbed the ranks of the gendarmerie, and now command griffon underlings of their own. Last night, however, a string of coordinated attacks on gendarme officers left many of these ponies dead and sent those remaining on the force into hiding, fearing for their lives. Racial tensions in Pridea are beginning to boil over, and this could only be the work of those damn Revolutionaries!"
 aquileia.25.a:0 "The Revolutionaries are getting bolder"
 
 aquileia.26.t:0 "Mail-Order Disaster"
 aquileia.26.d:0 "Pridea's gendarmerie is already stretched thin enough as it is with the deaths and resignations of our pony brethren in the force, so perhaps it was no surprise that a bomb managed to make its way inside of Baron Dennis' castle. The bomb had been stuffed inside a crate carrying a statue of himself the Baron had commissioned, and was wired to explode when the crate was split open, in anticipation of our baron being present for its reveal. As luck would have it, the Baron's art collector couldn't help but sneak a peek at the scupture before its reveal, and while Dennis will need a new collector for his private gallery and some repairs done to the stonework of his castle, the vile revolutionary plot has failed. Still, the plot is the talk of the barony, and it is sure to spread revolutionary tensions across Pridea..."
 aquileia.26.a:0 "Find whoever did this!"
 
 aquileia.27.t:0 "Rising Extremism"
 aquileia.27.d:0 "The past few days have seen Vinovia erupt into a veritable volcano of chaos and extremism. It began with a public speech by a revolutionary sympathizer in the town square that was quickly interrupted by our loyal gendarmerie. However, before they could disperse the crowd and place the sympathizer under arrest, a brick thrown from a nearby building struck a gendarme in the back of the skull, killing him instantly. The sergeant in charge of the gendarmerie then attempted to place every griffon present under arrest, and when some began to resist, his unit began indiscriminately firing into the crowd, killing seventeen and wounding dozens more. Riots broke out that night, and the city took on an orange glow as the mob set fires to storefronts and the homes of gendarmes and loyalists to the monarchy. Another confrontation between the mob and the gendarmes led to a brutal fistfight that saw scores wounded on both sides before a battalion of professional soldiers arrived to scatter the mob. Over the next few days, revolutionary sentiment has only seemed to increase, with more protests and riots throughout Vinovia. Our gendarmerie and the army are doing the best they can to control the situation, but calling it a tense time would be an understatement."
 aquileia.27.a:0 "It will pass"
 
 aquileia.28.t:0 "The Scandal"
 aquileia.28.d:0 "A snicker from the adjacent room took Duke Gadiffer's attention away from the book he read in his study. Frowning, the Duke placed a marker between the pages and looked up, his eyes meeting those of a pair of maids looking at him from the other room. Too late, the griffonesses realized that the Duke had heard him, and their faces paled at his stern look.\n\n"Come here," he ordered them, setting the book aside. Reluctantly, the two maids nervously stepped into his study, bowing their heads before the duke. After a moment to look them over, the Duke sharply frowned. "Were you laughing at me?"\n\n"N-No, milord," the first maid answers. "We would never!" exclaims the other.\n\n"Lie to me, and I'll take your tongues," the Duke warns them. After letting that threat sink in, he steeples his claws together. "Now," he says, staring them down. "What have I done that you find so amusing?"\n\n"I-It's lies, milord," the first maid says. "We were laughing at how absurd they are."\n\n"Lies?" Duke Gadiffer asks. "What lies?"\n\n"They commonfolk... they say your beak is crooked."\n\n"Crooked?" Gadiffer blinked. Then he laughed. "Oh, that's it? That's what's so funny?"\n\n"They also said you've got a balding spot on your head... and your talons are dull... but your brain is duller..." Gadiffer and the first maid looked at the second, who rattled off the talk of the town. "You're impotent and prefer the presence of gentlegriffs to hens... and chicks aren't allowed near the castle for their own safety..."\n\nThe duke held up a claw, silencing her. "Say one more thing and forget losing your tongue, I'll have your head." His simmering rage left the two maids fidgeting uncomfortably before them, before he angrily waved them away. "Leave me. Now."\n\nThe two maids wasted no time curtsying and scampering out of hte room as fast as they could, leaving the Duke to fume on the slander that was apparently making its way around Vinovia. Finally, sighing, he opened his book back up and tore through the pages with renewed energy, simply trying to take his mind away from the lies of the revolutionaries."
 aquileia.28.a:0 "No griffon will believe them, right?"
 
 aquileia.29.t:0 "Take It To The Duke"
 aquileia.29.d:0 "Duke Gadiffer watched the mob gather outside the gates of his castle in dismay. They weren't being particularly violent, which was a good thing, though he did have soldiers lining the walls with their weapons displayed to discourage any sort of unruly behaviour. The bad news was the slander and insults they chanted weren't that much better. It seemed the rumors he'd gotten out of his maids weren't exactly a limited sentiment, nor did they blow away on their own.\n\nAfter listening to their shouts for a few minutes, the Duke turned to his captain of the guard in exasperation. "Make them go away!" he shouted, emphatically gesturing with his claws. "Shoot them if you have to. Just make them stop!"\n\nThe captain bowed in acknowledgement and walked away, shouting orders to his nearby subordinates, and the Duke sighed and buried his face in his hand. With his respect in Vinovia all but gone, he could only watch as his supporters disappeared, one by one, and the ranks of the revolutionaries grew. And all because of one stupid rumor! Maybe he should just start executing anygriffon that continues spouting those lies. His beak wasn't that crooked after all..."

 aquileia.30.d:0 "Marshal Berthelot, the griffon most responsible for the destruction of the First Aquileian Republic and the restoration of Moriset Discret to the throne of Aquileia passed away today at the age of 87. The old Marshal was found dead in his manor in Vyzima by one of his servants, a quick examination proved that Berthelot had passed away naturally and a funeral procession was organised by his family and friends. Although Berthelot is seen as a hero by some Aquileians the majority of our people considered him a scoundrel and a lackey of the Discret family, thus making both him and his death a deeply dividing matter."

 aquileia.31.t:0 "The Royal Execution"
 aquileia.31.d:0 "The Republic claimed its grandest prize yet today with the capture and swift execution of the hated King Moriset. A daring raid last night saw the royal palace seized just before the break of day, and King Moriset was captured before he could slip out of a hidden passage in his bedroom. The King was immediately taken to his throne room in irons, where the Council had set up a court to try him from the room where he once condemned thousands of Revolutionaries to their deaths with his words alone. Today, however, the King seemed less interested in defending himself from his crimes, instead spewing insults at Theodore Vérany, the Republic, and the griffons of Aquileia who had brought him to justice. He was swiftly found guilty by unanimous decision of the court, and was dragged to the town square to meet the guillotine that had claimed so many of our comrades. The royal continued to spit forth vile slander against the Republic, threatening his unending wrath were he not released, up until the moment the blade removed his head from his body. He had very little to say after that.\n\nUnfortunately, the King's daughter, Vivienne, did not meet the same fate as her father. It seems there may have been a secret monarchist guarding her cell; either that, or the harlot used her charms to seduce a weak-willed comrade and convinced him to let her go free. Whatever the case may be, the hated Discret dynasty lives on, though with the king dead, Vivienne is likely to see her friends and supporters abandon her in the coming weeks. It is only a matter of time now."

 aquileia.32.t:0 "The Flight Of The King"
 aquileia.32.d:0 "Just before the dawn, a team of experienced revolutionaries, veterans from the glorious first revolution, assaulted the royal palace in unison with the uprisings throughout the capital. One team was tasked with breaching the walls with a wagon full of dynamite. A second was to land on the highest spires and fight their way inside, sealing the palace from the top down. A third was to surround the palace and make sure no griffon fled into the night.\n\nOf course, no plans go off without a hitch. The first team struggled to set off the wagon full of powder owing to the morning drizzle, costing valuable time. The second team was discovered circling above the palace waiting for the explosion, and the resulting shootout alerted the soldiers on the grounds to the attempt. By the time the first two teams successfully secured the palace, King Moriset and his family was nowhere to be found, and the third team fell for a diversion meant to draw their attention away from the fleeing king. King Moriset has vanished into the night, and our chance to end the vile Discret line in one fell swoop is gone."

 aquileia.33.t:0 "The Rila Bombing"
 aquileia.33.d:0 "A deafening blast broke windows and shook the buildings of central Rila today. Dazed citizens staggered out of their buildings and into the street, only to be greeted by a rising cloud of black smoke over the town square. This morning, vile rebels detonated a bomb in front of the statue of King Gerad, demolishing the statue and killing a platoon of soldiers marching by at that moment. Similar bombings were coordinated throughout the city, with the targets being a recruitment station, a post office, and a naval dockyard. Altogether, twenty soldiers lost their lives in these vicious attacks, and the city of Rila has been placed under martial law until the suspects have been apprehended."

 aquileia.34.d:0 ""Sergeant Dupont!"\n\nSergeant Dupont raised his head from the papers in front of him, missives from his superiors in Aquileia. "What is it, Henri?" the sergeant asked. Henri was supposed to be with the rest of his patrol along the wharves. Were they attacked by rebels?\n\nHis answer came when Henri held out a claw. In it was a piece of paper, marked with the distinct tricolour of the long-lost revolution. "We found these down by the shipyards."\n\n"These?" Sergeant Dupont asked, taking the paper from the private. It was a revolutionary pamphlet, decrying the monarchy and urging the peasants to fight for their 'freedom', whatever misguided concept the rebels supposed that was. "Are there more?"\n\nHenri nodded and dug into his bags. When he pulled his claw out, a fat stack of pamphlets came with it. "We tried collecting all we could, but..."\n\nSergeant Dupont stared at the stack in disbelief. How did the rebels manage to print so many pamphlets? He stood up and moved past Henri, heading for the door, the confused private following in his wake. Turning the latch with a claw, the sergeant looked out into the street, beak falling slack at the dozens of pamphlets drifting down the cobbles, carried along by the breeze.\n\n"I won't need to go far to look for stationary to tell the general about this...""

 aquileia.35.t:0 "The Meshorio Raid"
 aquileia.35.d:0 "While the previous revolution may have have centralized in the holdings of the previous King of Aquileia, one of its most fervent and chaotic breeding grounds was the Duchy of Rila. Here, revolutionary sentiment took root in dozens of different flavors, leading to the foundations of almost innumerous Revolutionary Clubs throughout the Duchy. While most nominally attempted to organize to beat back Monarchist sentiment, cooperation between the clubs has never been a guaranteed thing, and most were almost more eager to backstab each other than to take the fight to the monarchists. That sentiment seems to be changing today for the fractured clubs, however. One club in particular, the Meshorio Peasants, has been growing in strength lately. Where they are getting the additional support from, we cannot say, but their activity and recruitment has increased dramatically throughout the Duchy. Other clubs are either falling in line behind them or disappearing entirely, but one thing is absolutely certain: the clubs are growing in strength once more, and when the clubs begin to grow, Revolution is not far behind."

 aquileia.36.d:0 "It's a sound in the night, a whisper in a coffee house, a figure darting down an alleyway. It's the barred windows, the tense atmosphere, the way that young griffon's eyes watch you walk down the street. A hen cries out in outrage over rising bread prices, and a pair of gendarmes drag her away. A gang of angry young griffons and griffonesses marches down the streets, waving signs condemning the King and championing the rights of the working class. Pridea no longer feels safe, and Baron Dennis Discret's rule is no longer secure. The winds of change have arrived: the Revolution is coming to Pridea once more."
 aquileia.36.a:0 "Not again!"
 
 aquileia.37.t:0 "A Murder Most Foul"
 aquileia.37.d:0 "For years, the loyal pony minorities throughout the Barony of Pridea have formed the backbone of Baron Dennis Discret's militant gendarmerie. They aided him in retaking the city during the first Revolution, and were amply rewarded with high postings throughout the new gendarmerie and his personal army. Today, however, that seems to have made the ponies a target of the Revolution. Dozens of pony gendarmes and low-ranking military officers were systematically targeted and murdered throughout the previous week, crippling our gendarmerie and sending our loyal ponies into a fearful frenzy. While this has raised support for the monarchy to an all-time high amongst the pony population, they remain still a majority, and for every new pony swearing themselves to protect the monarchy, five new griffons meet in secret to plot its downfall, throwing their traitorous weight behind the coming of a second revolution."
 aquileia.37.a:0 "Damn them!"
 
 aquileia.38.t:0 "The Strike"
 aquileia.38.d:0 "The dockyards of Pridea are the pride of the Barony, and Pridea's naval thinkers are some of Aquileia's finest. Thus it was a great blow to the monarchy and Baron Dennis Discret's hold over the city when a massive strike broke out along the wharves, shutting down the dockyards. Hundreds of griffons gathered outside of the property, denying entry to any and all, and demanding better pay, better treatment, and better hours before they would return to work. The strike was broken up by the local marshal and the ringleaders arrested after a furious melee that saw more than a few griffs tumble into the harbor waters, but there is no guarantee it won't happen again...

 aquileia.39.d:0 "Wagons full of gold bullion arrived today in Westkeep, having made a difficult and perilous journey across the Kingdom, managing to somehow skirt past the pockets of unrest and republican sentiment scattered throughout. Colonel Colette personally received the wagons outside of her keep, and after exchanging a few words with the soldiers guarding the wagons, gave them permission to enter the stronghold. The wagons presumably came from the crown, but no royal mark was present on the crates of bullion; perhaps that was to keep their journey secret, their contents unassuming. Instead, only a short letter accompanied the shipment. "Make good use of this in the coming struggle," it said. "We know where your loyalties lie." No names demarcated the parchment, and the only signature plainly listing off the sender as "Your Friends in Aquileia."\n\nCollete smiled as she put the letter away. Was was coming to the Kingdom once more, and there was no better place for a soldier than on the front lines."

 aquileia.41.d:0 "The Republic is gripped with suspicion and paranoia as an artillery officer within our fair republic's army was placed under arrest, having been suspected of sending letters to correspondents within the Empire! To think that one of our fair citizens would attempt to exchange information and secrets with the power-hungry despots in Griffenheim is horrifying and almost unbelievable! There in lies the problem however, independent investigations have concluded that Pascal was not sending these letters, after interviewing his fellow officers as well as his own family. They considered him a "True Patriot to the Republic, and would give his life for it." Many suspect that the Policegriffons sent to arrest him placed these false documents within his home, and that these griffons were agents of the MPA, hoping to stir up anti-pony sentiment. Whatever the case may be, all Ponies within the republic are to be closely watched now."

 aquileia.42.d:0 "Notable journalist and novelist Émile Zolavi has recently died, in his old home on the Aquilan outskirts. His writing career has inspired a new trend in Aquileian culture, short-lived as it was, and his outspoken approach even convinced the government to loosing their grip on the society. His most notorious action, however, was a full scale condemnation of the ruling officials during the Pascal affair. His caustic, inflammatory accusation spared none, and he was quickly sued for libel. As a result, Zolavi escaped abroad to New Mareland, where he continued to defend his close friend Pascal. He was only recently permitted to return, but the stress of his prosecution has left him weary of life. The government of Aquileia has decided to name their newly formed literature prize after Zolavi, to honour his contribution to society. "

 aquileia.43.d:0 "Voracious lover of life and dandy, Charles Beaklaire was well known in the artistic circles of Aquila for his rather divisive poetry. While a vocal minority considered his work to be a rejuvenation of art, far more considered them to be works of complete debauchery. The numerous lawsuits and charges of defiling public morals have not deterred Beaklaire from publishing more verses on themes of modernity, love and wine. Additionally, he has taken it personally to confront his critics, causing multiple public brawls. This has resulted in many griffons receiving serious injuries, as Beaklaire is overly fond of the bottle, and great damage to public property. Recently however, his brief stint in the prison has somewhat mellowed him out, yet his works continue to cause much controversy in the cafés of Aquila."

His absurdist approach towards life, which is widespread in his works, has attracted many griffons, weary of the constant wars raging across the world. He has recently finished his newest novel, titled L'Étranger (The Outsider), which follows Griffsault and his indifferent lifestyle. The critics praised the main character's disposition towards life, authority and religion, stating that these are the proper values for the uncertain times.

Teaching in a small rural town in the depths of Orvaillo had seemed like such a dreary prospect, but it seemed that was where his life had taken him. The state paid a decent salary, and after the recent unrest he found the countryside good for his nerves.\n\nIn the corner of his eye he saw how one of the local farmers, the father of young Lacroix if he wasn't mistaken, was lurking by the door, glancing inside and mouthing along with the lecture. Of course... even the adults around here were illiterate.\n\n"Good afternoon Monsieur Lacroix, are you here for your son?" he decided to ask, the farmgriff startling. Before he could say anything though, Monsieur Mésange continued. "We are not quite finished yet, but please, have a seat. Maybe you can assist me if the children get too rowdy," he said with a smile as he motioned to the back of the classroom to help the farmgriff save face.

They needed him at the farm, after all.\n\nStill, Remy was happy, and he had taken to school like a fish to water. Maybe... she found herself dreaming as she stood by the stove... maybe this would really lead somewhere?\n\nRemy, meanwhile, was utterly absorbed in the book, reading about the strange and distant lands of "Equestria" and its supposedly immortal goddess-queen. Monsieur Mésange had let him borrow it on the condition that he'd perform a presentation on the book in front of the class, and Remy wasn't going to waste this chance.

"See, Remy has been an exceptional student. He is dilligent and talented in equal measure, and I am convinced that he has the potential to succeed even in higher studies. Therefore," Monsieur Mésange said, smiling at Remy, "I would like to give you a recommendation so that you may go to the Lycée."\n\nRemy tried to say something and accept politely, but the news made his eyes well up and he didn't manage to do anything but to nod as tears of relief and happiness began to flow down his cheeks.

Finding a seat, Remy sat down as his father helped him to get the bags up on the shelves above them\n\n"Mom, I will be okay," Remy said, giving his mom a hug. In truth, he was scared himself. He had barely even left the town before, and that he'd now move all the way to Vanguardigo to attend school was still a dizzying prospect.\n\n As his parents got off the train, they delayed outside, waving goodbye to him as the train began to slowly move again. Remy couldn't help but notice that his mother seemed to start crying again and swallowed to choke down his own tears.\n\nIt was frightening, but it was also exhilarating.

The Duke ordered the Ducal guard out to the palace gates and personally demanded the demonstrators scatter. When they refused to obey, he ordered the guard to open fire.\n\nWhen the smoke cleared, almost a hundred lay dead in the streets, with the police, the Ducal Guard and even the military storming the houses and clubs of suspected revolutionaries to bring down the hammer upon anyone seeking to disrupt the peace of Vinovia.

Theatergoers were able to witness birth of Kingdom of Aquileia during the first spectacular act. Followed by second act where theatergoers were able to witness valiant stand of Aquileian soldiers against army of Grover I. during his conquest of Griffonia. One was really able to feel their patriotic zeal when defending the land and everyone living in there. In third act theatergoers could see rebellion of proud aquileian patriots led by their king against tyrannical rule of Grover II. which drew many parallels to rebellion of King Gerard Discret in 978 and restoring sovereignty of Aquileia. Casting of the play was excellent and except small technical mishap during the climax of second act this journalist can only praise execution and sheer dedication that went into this play. During the entire play theatergoers could freely enjoy food from banquet tables prepared for the occasion.

Figure knocked three times. After a while door opened and young male red feathered griffon peered through the crack. He immediately recognized newcomer and smiled. "Pierre, good to see you!" He said friendly and let newcomer-Pierre inside. "I am sorry for being late." Pierre said with apologetic expression. "There were too many policeponies today. I couldn't risk leading them here, Louis." He explained as he removed his cloak, revealing not much older griffon with light orange feathers. "Don't worry we haven't started yet." Louis smiled. Both griffons moved into the next room where rest of the group was already gathered. Room was filled with griffons of all ages and genders. Some old, some young barely beyond being little chicks. They were no army for sure. Some wearing scraps of clothing others being armed with simple outdated revolvers. Yet atmosphere in the room was tense. "You would have us follow FJA? After they run away?!" One of the griffons shouted. "You do not understand. We need to work with them if we are to succeed. Only cooperation can ensure our victory over monarchists." His opponent argued. "NO! FJA is merely Vérany's band of bootlickers. Vérany who run away when things got tough. Abandoned everyone just to save his skin!" Yet another griffon chimed in. "Please be reasonable, comrades. We cannot win without compromise." Griffon continued to argue for alliance with FJA. "They are not so bad. We'll be able to enact our policies and FJA can help us quickly capture hearts of the people and establish truly free democratic nation. You must see that they are right." "Better coward than pony."

Yes, we will prevail!" Crowd noded, some clapped in agreement. "We now know that it is not enough to free just griffons of Aquileia. There are many others suffering under reactionary yoke! We will not stop until everygriff on the continent is free!" He continued. "Free to decide their own life. We don't need any fancy Kings, Princesses or Presidents to tell us what to do.

Everygriff of Aquileia needs to be ready to die for the cause of freedom and our nation because I can guarantee, the forces of bankers, shadowy oligarchs and nobles of the Empire are already scheming in unison with the King and his lackeys how to crush us into the ground.

It became clear that if revolution in Pridea is to succeed FJA needs to bring all revolutionary elements within the city on board. Preparations for meeting between FJA party representative and Pridean communards were under way. Meeting had to be rescheduled and moved to different location several times to different location, for fear of being discovered by police authorities. It needs no mention that might spell disaster for the revolution as a whole. At last one night members of all sides met in a forest within territory of Duchy of Vinovia.

They have dangerous ideas, dangerous ideas that will see this nation burn even moreso than those who merely cry out for freedom, whatever mockery they attribute to that word! They must be stopped!"\n\nAgain, cheering roared to meet him, but then he saw several griffons slipping out the doors in disgust. "Fools," he muttered to himself. He'd have his loyal enforcers find out who had left early, and make them sorry for it. "I have with me a list of communist sympathizers in Westkeep, gathered by my talons in the dark. We shall start with them and rid Aquileia of the communist menace once and for all! Who is with me?!"\n\nGriffons stood up and raised their voices, ready to join the march.

Once loyal griffons are turning their backs on the monarchy, and the tricolour is being raised in more places, and more openly as well. The Colonel has sent her soldiers to round up republicans and make arrests, but with the situation spiraling out of control as it is, it seems like a lost cause. To make matters worse, a recent meeting between the Colonel and nobles from the capital has made it clear that this increased recruitment has been going on throughout the Kingdom for some time, and it was only a matter of time before it made its way to Westkeep as well.

The Harmonists of the Front des Jeunes Aquileia - the FJA - have begun holding rallies in the streets of Vinovia, arquing that the Kingdom should reform to become a true democracy, a place where every griffon has a say in how the nation runs. While such ideas are certainly laughable and short-sighted, doomed to failure, the sizes of the crowds the FJA is beginning to attract are certainly worrying.

Normally, that would have been no cause for alarm - the mobs had always been poorly equipped - but today was different. Today, the mob brandished rifles of their own, clean and modern, obviously fresh out of a factory from somewhere. Where that somewhere was, Adeline had no idea. Of course, that didn't matter now. What mattered is that she was on the opposite end of a larger block of armed griffons, and with the company blocking the street from sidewalk to sidewalk, the mob couldn't possibly miss if they decided to open fire.\n\n"Think if we ask nicely they'll go away?" Remy asked from her side, his usually snarky jokes shaken with worry. "They could all fire their guns at once and not hit the side of a barn. It's not like they're trained, right?"\n\nBut Adeline knew better. Many of these griffons were older. Many probably fought in the previous Revolution. Many probably knew how to use the weapons they held. And when the mob started pointing their weapons at the gendarmes, her heart jumped into her throat.\n\n"Fire! Shoot them, damn it!" her sergeant shouted. Discipline moved her talon for her, training forcing her to follow the suicidal command, and Adeline squeezed her eyes shut in terror as she fired her rifle.\n\nThe mob's rebuttal ripped through the gendarmes with a terrifying thunder, and Adeline opened her eyes just in time to see a bullet drill right between them."

With the new election coming for the Second Republic, It seemed all but certain that Theodore Vérany would lead the harmonists in the FJA to victory. Instead, after several days of shockingly bitter and caustic debates, Theodore has decided to leave the FJA entirely, along with many of his supporters. No longer content to let his ideas for the Second Republic be beaten into compromise by the FJA, Theodore has established his own party, which will run in opposition to the FJA in the coming elections. The Parti National d'Aquilée will focus first and foremost on balancing the nation's budget, repaying all the debts the Republic incurred in the fighting, and stabilizing the economy to leave it strong enough to withstand the influence of monarchists beyond our borders. After his departure, the FJA is now struggling to find a griffon to unite them and guide them toward victory at the ballot box. It seems their inevitable victory is no longer so inevitable."

Thibault's nomination was expected, as not only is he a more moderate, and thus more palatable, candidate to come from the communists, he is also a hero of the Revolution, having sheltered many revolutionaries during the furious fighting for the capital, providing food and water for families displaced by the war from stockpiles set aside before the revolution, and organizing the downfall of organized monarchist resistance in the capital and the surrounding countryside. Now, with Election Day drawing ever nearer, Thibault has promised to continue the work he performed during the Revolution, by expanding his party and bringing regional representation to all the far-flung corners of Aquileia. He even seeks to continue providing homes for families displaced by the war, a move sure to see him attain easy gains at the ballot box. Thibault presents an excellent look for the communists, and is sure to draw the votes of countless griffons throughout Aquileia. But will he lead the PAT along more moderate and sensible paths, or is he merely a face to let the more radical griffons inside his party take control of the nation?"

As chaos quickly engulfed the nation and the duchy, Cécile swiftly rose to the top of the revolutionary cells operating out of Vinovia, urging for the valiant soldiers of the Republic to only fight those that still openly supported the monarchy. Her messages of harmony amongst even enemies had a remarkable affect in the fighting, and Vinovia saw some of the least partisan bloodshed and extrajudicial killing in the entire Republic. Now, the griffoness the citizens of Vinovia call their rose has come to Aquileia to champion the peaceful reconstruction of the nation. In the power vacuum left by Vérany's departure, she has risen to the top of the FJA, championing all the tenets of the harmony that once made the party strong. She seeks to foster cooperation between the different parties in Aquileia, not competition, and is committed to restructuring Aquileia's tax code and bringing the nation into the modern era with electification for the countryside and modernized labor laws. But can such grand and peaceful plans sway the fervent supporters of the Revolution outside of Vinovia? Only time will tell."

Centering around nationalism and Aquileian unity, the fascist Maréchal has unified griffons far and wide who fear the influence of the nations surrounding our great Republic and are looking for a strong leader to keep them safe. He champions the promotion of Aquileian culture and the expansion of our urban centers, as well as getting the former nobility to fall in line and provide some of their wealth to the Republic through generous pardons. Though the loyalties of the MPA throughout the revolutions are certainly suspect, it is quite clear that they are too large of a force with too much influence to simply label as traitors and be done with it.

However, Jean Capus who has lead the movement in favor of it painted a dire picture of our wine production. He has talked about fine Aquileian wine being mixed with poorer wines mass produced in Wingbardy, New Mareland, Talouse or Minotauria and sold as Aquileian or poor wine spiked with chemicals and alcohol.

The tone of the book becomes then increasingly somber as the young hero sees the crushing of the revolution at the hands of the monarchist armies, the long march to the cold duchy of Cloudbury, the cruel way the monarchists were persecuted there and the decay of the republic into a warlord state. The hero then turns to communism, blaming capitalism for Kemerskai’s failures and flees to Skynavia where he hopes to see a truer form of democracy flourish. Sadly for him, he only discovers famine and the bickering between ideological groups. Finally, he concludes that republicanism in all its forms is a “spring flower”, beautiful in many ways but incapable of lasting. The book ends with the hero sailing back to his native Vinovia, contemplating all the pain he caused by his naivety.\n\nWhile some republicans called Fauxvelles a traitor, other tried to claim that the book was apocryphal and that he was forced. But Fauxvelles was knighted for his writing and held numerous speech to apologize for his errors and to denounce republicanism or even moderate constraints to royal power.

The traditional solidarity and craftgriffship culture were withering under the strain caused by mechanization after the revolution. The writings of Caramel Marks also left their mark. For years now, glassmakers were increasingly identifying as proletarian workers whose interests were fundamentally at odds with the wealthier guild members.\n\nFor a time, guild members attempted to soften the divide by making deals to improve working conditions. Unfortunately for them, the ideological radicalization of the time gradually degraded the willingness to make such piecemeal contracts. Both workers refused to adhere to the system and glassworks owners ceased to rely on the apprenticeship system and started to use wage labor under contract outside of the guild system.

In a moment of lucidity, the strikers allowed Desvases’ family to flee the scene, claiming they were only interested in forcing Desvases to finally agreeing to a fair deal. The police was alerted and quickly surrounded the mansion. Negotiations fell apart as the police unit was lead by a political friend of Desvases whose emotions and anticommunist opinions got the better of him.

Tomorrow, the crowds would sing revolutionary songs, write slogans on the walls and spit behind nobles and guards. And his advisors would come back to the palace to badger him about beating them back into obedience.\n\nHe was tired. His conscience was weighing increasingly heavy on his shoulders. The truth was plain and simple and yet it pained him to discover himself so foolish. He had always been at odds with his family. The Discret dynasty had always been so... Backward looking. they had no ideas as to what the world should become. They only saw tradition and Aquileia as their personal property. There was no place for popular consent, greater ideals of statecraft or even a conception of life being more than obedient labour. Those ideas, any understanding of the great truths of the world really, were held not by them but by the likes of Kemerskai or Vérany. Michel always saw the republic as an experiment that had been worth trying, even if it cost to his family.  His birth didn’t leave him much choice in life but it gave him some power. His power had been the sword of ducal power. Yet, he tried to subvert it, transforming it into a tool to carve something new. If he had bore any other name than Discret, he would have been executed for treason already but the family let him indulge in hosting philosophers and artists if the bastilles would operate and if Rila was stable. Not enough, he thought. And he indulged more, helping the republicans to bring about\n\nAnd what now? The bastilles were full, yet Rila was clamoring for revolution. All because he followed his ideals, blind to the fact that his friends, those reasonable partisans of compromise, reform and freedom in either a monarchy or a peacefully installed republic, were drowned in the cries of blood. All because of these "enragés", the rabid members of this Cocardiers club. It was them who resonated with the people, who spoke to their lower instincts. They were everywhere in Rila now, robbing, pressuring, killing and worse. And they wouldn’t stop until all of the Discret family lay dead in a pit.\n\nYet maybe cooler heads would prevail in the end.

Others were simply united in their conclusions of the failure of the monarchy and a need to end, some even socialist in nature. Others like the Club des Haies, the Fanal or the Club Patriote had more precise ideas as to what the future Republic would have to look like to be safe. However, the most important group of all was the Cocardiers, a group of radicals, single minded in ensuring that the second Republic would not be crushed, whatever the cost. And if the Republic was to not be crush, the monarchy would have to be. Brutally and utterly.\n\nReaching a compromise to make such a loose coalition had been a hurdle but it had been accomplished. They were all there, over two hundred representatives in attendance to plan and execute a revolution."

 aquileia_two.3.d:0 "Today, representatives from the Societé Justice presented to the Committee informations about the patrol plans and schedules of the security forces in Rila for the coming week. A strong debate was held as to what could be done with it. Some extremists from the Cocardiers wished to use the information to organize an uprising. However, the consensus was that it was still to early and that the information could be used for propaganda purposes. In the end, the propagandists prevailed and the Cocardiers' plan was voted down, not without some name calling.\n\nThe representatives of the Club du Verbe Vrai were tasked to use their network within Rila's print shops and bookstores to stockpile republican propaganda in the forms of posters, banners and notices. The Fanal was then tasked with using their followers, mostly illiterate workers, to insert the material in the streets.\n\nUnbeknownst to most of the Committee, the "informations" were in fact provided by Duke Michel himself. Members of the more reform-minded faction reached a deal with him to spread the word of republicanism in the capital. The security forces had in fact been given orders to clear the streets and stand down, effectively turning a blind eye to the whole operation."

 aquileia_two.4.t:0 "The Storming of the Bastilles"
 aquileia_two.4.d:0 "While some knew Rila as a place of fine wines, great coasts and theater but to the Republicans, it was also a prison. The restored regime wished to maintain prisoners away from the historical center of the revolution. It didn't say idle either over the years since the end of the revolution, sending continuously more griffs to Rila. These prisoners were gathered in a few fortresses that would serve as fortified prison : the bastilles. As time went on, they become the living symbol of the royal oppression in Rila, standing high as a perpetual reminder of where lovers of liberty would go to die in darkness if caught.\n\nThe Committee, united in this at least, sought to put an end to theses prisons. They planned a mass-scale attack on all bastilles with the following objectives : starting fires and fights at various points in town to distract the troops, gather mobs of sympathizers, overwhelm the defenses, free the prisoners and loot as many guns as possible.\n\nOn [Root.GetDateText], the plan was executed. Mobs of republicans assembled and led by club members marched on the fortresses. In some places, they found sympathetic or cowardly guards who simply refused to engage them, opening the gates in exchange for their safety. Everywhere else, fighting followed and it was bloody and bruised that the republicans freed their comrades and common prisoners alike. That day, the Republicans grew in number by the hundreds and many tears of joy were shed as long lost friends and parents met again. Sadly, in the Flowerino bastille, the mob assembled by the local Cocardiers suffered greatly at the claws of the guards and butchered everygriff inside in a frenzied revenge.\n\nThe news alarmed the authorities who scrambled to crack down on the clubs but information was lacking. The ducal palace was panicking. Yet, one griff still stayed calm : duke Michel himself. Some of his advisors saw it as a sign of his resolve in the face of danger. Sadly, for them, it was not because of a strength of character but because he knew beforehand. After all, six fortresses don't fall in a single day to angry mobs because of sheer revolutionary fervor..."

 aquileia_two.5.d:0 "In Rila, the heart of the revolution beats strongly. There, the cause of the revolution is supported by steel resolve, especially among the proud Cocardiers. However, what the republicans have in strength of character, they lack in weaponry. And while one can argue that Aquileian republicanism is bulletproof, revolutionary bodies are not. The cause requires guns.\n\nThe committee explored many plans to gather weapons from the local arsenals or gunrunners but it ultimately failed. The arsenals in Rila were too well-guarded or too loyal to the regime.\n\nArmed with this, members of various clubs packed up and crossed the borders to Aquileia, linking with the republican lodges there. They consented to help of course but still it wasn't enough to consider their mission even remotely successful. So, gnashing their beaks, the republicans indebted themselves to a variety of unsavory ponies and griffs from all over. Large sums were paid in exchange for jamming guns, poorly assembled contraband guns produced by socialists or some that were state of the art indeed should you have had them during the first revolution.\n\nThe Cocardiers smuggled it all back to Rila with difficulty. Some crates were lost in the border crossing after rilan border patrol griffs spotted one of their groups but all revolutionaries managed to finally come back to the republican compound in Dilven. There, despite their pained looks of disappointment, they were greeted with cheers by their comrades now in arms. The cause finally had claws."

The issue at claw had been a proposal from a Cocardier representative who argued that one of the cause of the first republic's downfall had been the support from the wealthy to the monarchy. As such, he posited, any griff of wealth whose loyalty to the republican cause is not beyond doubt should be made a target and robbed of their wealth to fund the revolution. While the proposal was at first met with grumbles or shuckles from the moderates and reformists ranks, it resonated among many club representative from the lower classes and some socialists. They scolded the moderates and reformists for their unwillingness to follow through on the revolutionary ideal. After the attack was made against their rivals, the Cocardiers loudly heckled them and rallied around the proposal. Some moderates wavered while others tried to defend their reputation. Some left the meeting in protestation. In the end, the proposal was adopted.\n\nThe debate had some immediate consequences as members of various clubs decided to join the Cocardier cause, reinforcing their lead in the Committee further.\n\nIn the following weeks, members of the Cocardiers would begin organising raids on the so-called "rupins", wealthy nobles of Rila, and recruiting the populace to join in the looting."

After the roll call, the session fell into a semi-silence, a far cry from all previous sessions. There were some speeches, calm ones, but a recess was quickly called. Many groups gathered hastily to chat, some worried and other enthusiastic.\n\nWhen the committee went back in session, there were a few speeches. Club leaders were congratulating the new majority for bringing some clarity of purpose to their group. Some pointed to the necessity of fair debates and respect for one another. The speeches were respectfully applauded. Some less than others, prompting more worried looks among some representatives. Finally, the leader of the new majority rose. In his speech, he thanked the clubs for their support but called for unity. It was no longer time for half-measures. The ideals of the Republic required action and no more endless debates and planning. They were ready."

Duke Michel knew they weren't just coming from kitchens where families would lovingly make cherry pies together. He sighed sadly, knowing that it was a piece of Aquileia's soul and spirit that was burning down there.\n\nIn the streets of Rila and in other cities, order had been given. All bookshops, printers and private libraries were to be raided. Any books deemed subversive to the established order of Aquileia and its vassals were to be gathered and burned in front for all to see.\n\nThe decision had been a tough one. His advisors had united against the duke who had committed himself to protect a certain degree of freedom of thought and writing among philosophers in Rila. He fought back but it was clear that if he didn't comply, the fabric of his administration would begin to unravel at a time when he couldn't afford to. It would enrage his friends and allies but it was a necessary compromise to maintain some degree of order. At least, it would keep the royal administration in Aquila at bay."

 aquileia_two.9.d:0 "Rila has long been plagued by difficulties in tax collection as well as a legacy of ducal fiscal concessions to the nobility. For years, the ducal advisors tried to sugarcoat it at court in Rila or Aquila but to put it plainly : the treasury is nearly empty. At this moment, credit is unavailable and the duchy needs funds to handle the instability.\n\nFortunately, the ducal administration has designed a policy based on an area where the ducal authorities has remained absolutely unchallenged : the organisation of fairs and marketplaces. Traditionally, it has been used to favor trade and the organization of fairs in all of Rila. It has historically made marketplaces and fairs much more popular in the ducal policies. The plan is to harness this popularity by enacting a decree banning trade outside of fairs and markets organized by the duchy and imposing a fee on all participating vendors. This would also placate the trading nobility and the merchants who heavily lobbied for interventions against new competition.\n\nThe decisions hasn't gone down without immediate reactions. The coterie of liberal thinkers hosted by the duke is rather miffed, to put it mildly. Smaller merchants have also already began petitioning to lower the fee or repeal the decree. Duke Michel himself seemed sympathetic to these pleas and already agreed to grant some exceptions to various small farmers and artisans who regularly took parts to the markets."

Griffons and ponies alike are gathering to watch the grand parade, attend a grand ceremony at the temple of Eyr and finally ending with public festivities and even a grand popular ball at the main plaza ! Duke Michel will oversee it all himself as a grand marshall and will attend the festivities. One could even catch the eye of Rila's most prized bachelor at the ball.\n\nNow, one would be hard-pressed to find a griff who could tell you the story of Weeping Renée in Rila. One who could is a griff with a burning passion for Aquileian folklore at duke Michel's court. She was apparently a most devout griff who threw herself before emperor Grover II as he prepared himself to burn down Rila. While a fine story and a proof that history lessons may be needed, it mostly mattered as a justification for the grand festivities. And while the good people watches our duke dancing, a whole other kind of dance will happen all over the capital.\n\nThe ducal administration knew of many warehouses in the capital which could be potential safehouses or arsenals for the revolutionaries. The duke himself produced a list of specific warehouses owned by members of the Cocarcier revolutionary club. Asked by an advisor of how he discovered it, the duke simply chuckled : "Why Weeping Renée of course ! It is only normal she would come back to prevent other griffs from setting the duchy ablaze." The advisors awkwardly chuckled back. They knew they wouldn't know any more."

A true city of tents and music has been erected around the rural temple of Eyr known as the Rocher tranquille, the tranquil rock. Under the patronage of the duke, local artisans and farmers have been invited to sell and share their products, free of taxation. Artists are entertaining the masses and activities have been organized for the fledglings.\n\nWith only minimal security, duke Michel has braved the danger and mingles among the crowd. Numerous activities have been planned. Michel will notably be the judge of numerous contests, notably for the largest produce. Tonight, a great public feast will be organized, with the duke offering some wine barrels to the populace from his own vineyards. Tomorrow, a grand hunt will be organized for the local nobilities.\n\nYet, the true object of the party is not to entertain the common folk but to distract him. As griffs of all ages entertains themselves in a family-friendly manner, the ducal army has moved in the countryside. One by one, farmhouses are being raided for any traces of revolutionary hiding places or sympathizers.\n\nAs expected too, the presence of the duke attracted opportunistic revolutionaries, namely a local group of Cocardier terrorists. The fools tried to make a move on the duke. Sadly for them, the duke's entourage had been tipped off and as soon as they tried to attack him, soldiers in civilian clothing jumped on them. Surprisingly enough, peasants joined the fight on the side of the duke, thinking the duke was indeed at risk. The trap suddenly transformed into a glorious moment as Michel thanked the crowd for saving his life. The fair was roaring with cheers for the duke. And all the while, the farms of the good cheering people were being thoroughly investigated."

While it was happy news for the shipyard, it was surprisingly well-received in Rila where the duke Michel ordered what the ducal palace called an "overdue celebration of the Pélis shipyard workers, sailors and overall naval achievements". With extraordinary speed, a grand Défilé was organized on the seaside streets in a celebration of Pélis, a true pearl of the duchy.\n\nYet, the elites of Rila had little interest in Pélisian naval tradition. However, they had been keeping tabs on the revolutionary activities in Pélis which was a well-known bastion of republicanism in the duchy. Revolutionary clubs like the Fanal or the Cocardiers had ample support among the dockworkers and shipyard workers. Local forces had gathered a lot of information but never used them, for fear that action could cause an uprising. The revolutionaries knew it and exploited it.\n\nThe Défilé allowed to finally break the revolutionaries surveillance. Ducal agents assembled in Pélis, disguised as civilians attending the Défilé. They came by cars, carriages, train, ships and even by foot. With their support and with the distraction from the Défilé, the local authorities finally launched a large scale raid. A bastion of hardline republicanism in Rila had fallen by a single stroke."

 JER_infiltrate_the_prisons_desc:0 "The king's spies, the Chouette, are his eyes and ears in the streets, and they have rooted out and executed dozens of upstart revolutionary cells over the past four years. Keeping a better eye on the Chouette should give us more warning when a raid is imminent, and better yet, track the king's movements."
 JER_infiltrate_the_palace:0 "Into The Lair Of The Beast"
 JER_infiltrate_the_palace_desc:0 "Without a plan in place to capture King Moriset, he will surely slip through our claws once more. We must be ready to assault his palace when the next revolution begins. Scouting the grounds and assembling a team of experienced revolutionaries will greatly improve our chances."
 JER_convince_the_officers:0 "A Few New Friends"
 JER_convince_the_officers_desc:0 "The king's army is full of generals who fought for him out of necessity, believing the previous revolution to be doomed to failure. While they were right then, this time will be different, and with enough convincing, we may be able to presuade them to join our cause."
 JER_stoke_the_fires:0 "Stoke The Fire"
 JER_stoke_the_fires_desc:0 "Discontent is rife within the king's army, and many of the soldiers openly bemoan his rule. If we can stoke the fires of revolution in their hearts, we may be able to convince them to abandon the king and join the new republic."
 JER_infiltrate_vinovia:0 "The Land Of Wine And Traitors"
 JER_infiltrate_vinovia_desc:0 "The revolution was sabotaged from within by weak revolutionary leaders in Vinovia, who laid down their arms under Duke Gadiffer's rule after hearing just a few measely speeches. If we want the next revolution to succeed, we will have to become more involved in Vinovia than last time."
 JER_encourage_extremeism:0 "Encourage The Radicals"
 JER_encourage_extremeism_desc:0 "The only way to break Duke Gadiffer's hold over Vinovia is to mobilize our more radical and fanatic elements to the duchy. If we can stir up a frenzy and start riots in the streets, the Duke's honeyed words will no longer be able to save his wretched spine."
 JER_political_slander:0 "Air The Laundry"
 JER_political_slander_desc:0 "One of Duke Gadiffer's tricks to dismantle and discredit the revolutionary factions in Pridea was vile slander and false rumors about the moral character of their leaders. Well, two can play at that game, and soon the duke will be little more than a mockery throughout Vinovia."
 JER_anti_monarchist_rallies:0 "Stick It To the Duke"
 JER_anti_monarchist_rallies_desc:0 "With the Duke's credibility in shambles, it's time to march on his castle hold and show the soldiers there just how far he has fallen. A duke without an army is nothing to fear, and his friends and supporters are beginning to desert him at a wonderful rate."

 JER_the_triumph_desc:0 "Victory at last! Once more, the monarchists of Aquileia lie in shambles, chased from the country or placed six feet deep in its soil.

 JER_educate_the_populace:0 "Battle Illiteracy"
 JER_educate_the_populace_desc:0 "Ignorance is the tool of tyrants, the weapon of warlords. Knowledge is the foundation that freedom rests upon.

 JER_delegalize_the_monarchy_desc:0 "Everything we do as a republic must have a basis in our laws and constitution. This includes removing the last vestiges of the monarchy and embracing democracy.

 JER_social_security_for_all_aquileians_desc:0 "For as long as anyone can remember, Aquileia has maintained a sizeable pony minority throughout its lands, with the ponies acting as a support base for the Discret monarchy.

 JER_limit_presidential_executive:0 "Limit The Presidential Executive"
 JER_limit_presidential_executive_desc:0 "One of the most hotly debated parts of the Aquileian constitution is the function of the executive office. Our political stance has always been to limit the executive and devolve more power into the Assemblée Nationale and have them be the primary driving force behind national development. Our president is not to become a dictator, and these restrictions will make sure of that."
 JER_presidential_powers_expansion_act:0 "Expand The Presidential Executive"
 JER_presidential_powers_expansion_act_desc:0 "One of the most hotly debated parts of the Aquileian constitution is the function of the executive office. Our political stance has always been to strengthen the stewarding role of the executive position and ensure that the nation has a strong figure to rally behind. By increasing the presidential powers, they can take decisive action when needed to ensure the nation will never again fall to tyranny."
 JER_army_expansion_act:0 "Armée Républicaine Expansion Plan"
 JER_army_expansion_act_desc:0 "If Aquileia is to defend its revolutionary freedom, and possibly even expand it to the rest of the continent, we need to ensure that our army shall be up top the task.

 JER_ammends_with_beefstake_MPA_desc:0 "Many members of Rodier's MPA party have incorporated tenants of socialist thinking into their policies.

 JER_attract_FJA_members_desc:0 "Many FJA members are strong advocates of a welfare state that supports the population through the government.

 JER_union_representation_act:0 "Loi Sur La Représentation Syndicale"
 JER_union_representation_act_desc:0 "Ensuring union representation in government at a local level will surely increase the economic output of Aquileia. For if the workers can control their own work, then they will always be more productive! However, this idea is extremely controversial across the assembly and will surely lose us some support."
 JER_state_housing:0 "Logement d'État"
 JER_state_housing_desc:0 "The providing of housing to the poor by the state has long been a policy of Aquileia's Socialist movements. We are no different; we will ensure that all have a place to spend their nights in comfort and that none shall be left living on the streets! Unfortunately, many political rivals claim this is too expensive and will bankrupt the nation, but we will never give up our beliefs!"

 JER_civil_nationalism:0 "Aquileian Civil Nationalism"
 JER_civil_nationalism_desc:0 "Aquileia is a land of its citizens. This is a founding principle of our Socialist ideology that we should never forget. While we are not nationalists in the vein of those Blackshirts in Wingbardy or others like them, we are proud of our nation and of our revolutionary past. Our identity as Aquileians is inseparable from this revolutionary struggle for liberty, and we would do well not to forget it."
 JER_bring_the_unions_into_politics:0 "Politicise The Unions"
 JER_bring_the_unions_into_politics_desc:0 "While unions have previously only been active on a local political basis, it is time to bring them into the national light. Every administrative division, including on the federal level, will have a council of union members that represent the interests of the working Griffon. This way, the state will always be responsive to the needs of the laborer."
 JER_ammend_gun_ownership_laws:0 "Amend Gun Ownership Laws"
 JER_ammend_gun_ownership_laws_desc:0 "The pony revolutionary Caramel Marks once said, "Under no pretext should arms be surrendered; any attempt to disarm the workers must be sabotaged, by force if necessary." While we refute most of his philosophy, we agree with this statement. In the time before the first revolution, the monarchy tried to confiscate the weapons of the people and turn them against us. We shall never let this happen again!"

 JER_foreign_brigades_desc:0 "We have succeeded in throwing off our own chains of tyranny, and we have created a haven for the worker wihtin our own borders.

 JER_tax_policy_revisions:0 "Redfine The Aquileian Tax Code"
 JER_tax_policy_revisions_desc:0 "Currently, our nation's tax code is all over the place. With there being roughly 63 different tax laws overlapping across all layers of society. This will not do.

This will hopefully both increase revenue and decrease spending, bringing a much needed economic boost to our nation."
 JER_rural_electrification_commission:0 "Commission d'Electrification Rurale"
 JER_rural_electrification_commission_desc:0 "Many parts of rural Aquileia still lack full electrical connection. As one of Griffonia's premier nations, this can not remain the case! We will embark on a campaign to connect electricity to the entirety of the nation, opening new lands to industry and development. However, the plan will cost a lot of money, therefore costing us political support as well."
 JER_labour_law_revisions:0 "Modernise The Labour Laws"
 JER_labour_law_revisions_desc:0 "While we are not socialists by any means, we recognize it is the responsibility of the state to protect its workers through the legislative process. A new Aquileian labor code shall be drafted in order to provide legal protection for the rights of laborers as well as their unions.

 JER_aquileia_reclaimed_desc:0 "Finally! Aquileia's own blood brothers, those Griffons of the périphérie, are once again united with their homeland and can bask in the same freedom that embraces their countrygriffs. With this unification, our popularity is on the rise amongst the population, and we should easily be able to get some more legislation through the Assemblée riding on our new popularity."
 JER_anti_monopoly_laws:0 "Anti-Monopoly Laws"
 JER_anti_monopoly_laws_desc:0 "Looking back to the days of the Royal tyranny, we see that the monarchy often employed massive corporations to oppress the common griff into what was, in essence, slave labor. We must create a fairer business and working enviroment that all griffs will be able to operate in wthout fear of megacorperations driving them out of markets, or abusing them as laborers."
 JER_the_republican_gednermerie:0 "Form The Gendarmerie"
 JER_the_republican_gednermerie_desc:0 "While the idea of oppressive state surveillance and the very memory of La Chouette strikes a chord of fear and hatred in all Aquileians, we recognize that there is a need for protection amongst Aquileians. Not to spy on our own citizens, but to protect us from foreign agents and to conduct operations abroad. Of course, they may, at some points, need to operate domestically, but there we can only do our best."
 JER_cultural_pluralism:0 "Cultural Pluralism"
 JER_cultural_pluralism_desc:0 "While all the Griffons of the périphérie may now bask in the glory of our freedom, many of them are unwilling to accept other aspects of Aquileian culture. While in a perfect world, we would love it if they eventually accepted the Aquileian way of life, we recognize this is unlikely to ever happen. Instead, we must emphasize a multi-cultural outlook in all territories we rule."
 JER_eradicate_hunger:0 "Limited Price Regulations"
 JER_eradicate_hunger_desc:0 "The idea of bringing in price regulations to feed the urban poor of Aquileia has been brought up many times since our rise to power. While many see it as too much government intervention in economics, some are starting to come around to the idea's benefits. From now on, the government will purchase grain at market price and distribute it to the poor at a lower rate, or in exchange for labor projects."

 JER_wrangle_the_party:0 "Wrangle The Party"
 JER_wrangle_the_party_desc:0 "The MPA is a political bushfire. Unpredictable, out of control, and extremely dangerous. It is time to bring the députés in with the party line to ensure the Président is never lacking in support for his measures. Why use coalitions when you can pass what you want by yourself?"
 JER_repatriation_act:0 "Repatriate the Idole-d'Aquiléenne"
 JER_repatriation_act_desc:0 "The "Idole-d'Aquiléenne" is a tense subject in Aquileian politics. Starting out as fervent monarchists, this mostly pony based organization has, over the years, become closely affiliated with the MPA's new Republican cause. Since the revolutions, they have since calmed their methods a bit, and it is now time to legalize their practices once again."
 JER_urban_expansion_act:0 "Loi Sur l'Etalement Urbain"
 JER_urban_expansion_act_desc:0 "The Maréchal can see the future of industry and development. He knows that the center of commerce and even of society in the future will be the megacities. In line with this, we must invest in our urban infrastructure to provide services to all those who live in the cities. Many of these jobs will come in the form of military manufacturing to prepare for the coming national conflicts."
 JER_institute_of_cultural_preservation:0 "Found l'Institut de Préservation Culturelle"
 JER_institute_of_cultural_preservation_desc:0 "One of the strongest forces backing the MPA politically is that of Aquileian nationalism. The preservation of the Aquileian cultural identity was one of Rodier's main speaking points during the election, and now it is time to make good on those promises. The creation of a government agency with the sole job of sponsoring and nurturing our culture will be a strong boon to our nation's strength and pride!"
 JER_patriotic_fervour:0 "Visions Of Greatness"
 JER_patriotic_fervour_desc:0 "Aquileia is once again fast on her way to rising to become a Great Power on Griffonia once again!

He has brought our nation glory and prestige! Are we shall follow him to the end!"
 JER_establish_state_unions:0 "Syndicats Nationaux"
 JER_establish_state_unions_desc:0 "In order to improve our urban economic output, some members of the MPA, styling themselves as "National-Syndicalists" have recommended implementing a program of state-sponsored unions in order to improve working conditions while still retaining control over the economic process to serve the state. While some more traditional members call this "Communist," we are more than happy to embrace this idea."
 JER_aquileiafication_campaign:0 "Aquilifaction Campaign"
 JER_aquileiafication_campaign_desc:0 "The griffons of the périphérie still cling to backward cultures that demean their lives with uncivilized practices. We shall bring these griffons under our wings, show them how to be Aquileian, how to be greater than they once were. And once the lesser cultures are wiped from the land, we can all rejoice in the simple fact that we are all Aquileian, griffons of liberty and freedom!"
 JER_establish_the_foreign_legion:0 "Establish The Légion Etrangère"
 JER_establish_the_foreign_legion_desc:0 "The Idole-d'Aquiléenne has thus far served its purpose well. It has brought more ponies into the Republican MPA and bolstered our support in key areas. And now the Maréchal has the perfect idea on how to thank them. By integrating the Idole-d'Aquiléenne into the Aquileian army as the "Légion Etrangère," we will create a government-sanctioned way for minority groups to do their service to the state."

 JER_the_four_principles_desc:0 "While the Aquileian revolution has always done its best to embody the three principles of Théodore Vérany, "Liberté, Egalité, and Fraternité", Rodier wants another one added to the list. By ensuring nationalism maintains as high of a position as the other three, we will ensure that Aquileia will always be a distinct cultural identity from the rest of griffonia, a shining example for all to try to become."

 JER_poach_support:0 "Poach The Députés"
 JER_poach_support_desc:0 "The PNdA is, in many ways, a coalition ticket in a coalition system. Composed of politicians from all over the ideological spectrum of the Assemblée. All dissatisfied with other political factions and rallying behind Vérany's Pan-Griffonian ideology. With such a diverse cast backing us up, it is relatively easy to bring in support from all parts of society to boost our political acumen."
 JER_use_veranys_reputation:0 "The Hero Of The Republic"
 JER_use_veranys_reputation_desc:0 "Vérany's image as the hero of the Republic still rings loud and true with many across Aquileia. While many call him a relic of a bygone age, his loyal members of the PNdA still remember his glories and his victories. Along with them, many of the FJA still remember his as the greatest spokesgriff of Democracy, and are willing to vote with him in memory of that image."
 JER_reform_the_national_bank_of_aquileia:0 "Reform The National Bank"
 JER_reform_the_national_bank_of_aquileia_desc:0 "One of the greatest issues currently facing our revolutionary republic is that of the national debt. Through the fighting and the bloodsheed, we also spend massive amounts of gold and other currencies to keep our state stable. To manage this, we must create a financial institution with the sole purpose of lending money to the government so that we may remain solvent."
 JER_increase_military_funding:0 "Redefine The Army Budget"
 JER_increase_military_funding_desc:0 "Théodore Vérany has big plans for where Aquileia will go from here. He is a Pan-Griffonian through and through and believes strongly in going forth to spread our revolution across all of Griffonia. And to do that, he believes we must expand the army. It will cost extreme amounts of government funds, but we should worry not! For now, we have the National Bank to fund us!"
 JER_the_dream_aint_dead:0 "The Dream Isn't Dead"
 JER_the_dream_aint_dead_desc:0 "We can not give up on the great dream of Pan-Griffonianism! If the revolution only exists in Aquileia, then inevitably the other monarchies of the land will see us as a threat, and come to snuff us out once and for all. It is our sacred duty as a republic that successfully cast off the chains of bondage that once held us, to go beyond our borders, and free the rest of Griffonia!"
 JER_support_military_industrial_complex:0 "The Military Industrial Complex"
 JER_support_military_industrial_complex_desc:0 "Cooperation with the large factories of Aquileia will allow us to stockpile enough war materials for the coming conflict. Using loans and shares from the national bank, we will be able to bankroll a far larger military than before, always ready to defend republicanism wherever it is threatened. And eventually, that army will pay a visit to Griffenheim itself..."
 JER_griffonian_citizenship_act:0 "The Griffonian "Citizenship" Act"
 JER_griffonian_citizenship_act_desc:0 "The Assemblée has drafted a controversial provision that massively eases the requirements to get Aquileian citizenship to any republican dissidents who enter our borders. While masquerading as a way to attract intellectuals from abroad, in reality, we are building networks, making contacts, and sharing information from abroad. When there are republicans everywhere, the imperials have nowhere to hide."
 JER_equal_lingustic_representation_act:0 "Equalise The Languages" 
 JER_equal_lingustic_representation_act_desc:0 "The effort by the Assemblée to equalize all Griffonian languages in the eyes of the Aquileian government is seen by all as a massive step towards fully embracing Pan-Griffonian identity. It sets up Aquileia as a leader in international efforts for republicanism, while also setting it on a collision course with the Imperial government. As there is no way they can pretend Vérany lacks ambition any longer."
 JER_prepare_for_the_future:0 "The Father Of The Revolution"
 JER_prepare_for_the_future_desc:0 "It is now time for Vérany to step into the role that was already made for him. He is not just the hero of both revolutions, but he is also their ideological father. It was his ideas that propelled our nation to what it is today, his influence creating the Aquileia its citizens now know.

 JER_diplomacy_is_good:0 "A Soft Claw"
 JER_diplomacy_is_good_desc:0 "Our neighbors to the west may appear like squabbling buffoons to the rest of the world, but we know they may have some sense to them.

 JER_the_conquest_of_avian_desc:0 "The lands of Verenia have for centuries, been torn between the influences of the Herzlanders and Aquileians. With our nation's rise to revolution however, the monarchs of these lands have become wary of indulging too far into Aquileian culture, lest their subjects become "uppity".

 JER_on_our_own:0 "On Our Own"
 JER_on_our_own_desc:0 "Long ago, the failed revolutionary Alexander Kemerskai failed to bring freedom to the Herzland. He retreated north and became a monarch in all but name, abandoning the principles he once fought for. While we may appreciate his effort, he has lost the revolutionary mandate.

 JER_mechainsed_agriculture:0 "Tractor Grants"
 JER_mechainsed_agriculture_desc:0 "Mechanizing our agriculture would greatly increase production, ensuring every citizen in Aquileia remains well fed.

 JER_railroads:0 "The Autoroute"
 JER_railroads_desc:0 "Many urbanites are acquiring cars to make travel easier, yet for the most part can only use them in cities as the roads on the countryside are in poor condition.

 JER_land_reforms:0 "Land Redistribution"
 JER_land_reforms_desc:0 "Under the oppressive rule of the Discret dynasty, land was bought from the poor and granted to loyal aristocrats who soon amassed huge tracts of land.

Reformed ownership laws will protect the commoners from exploitation by the rich and create a fair and just society."
 JER_national_factories:0 "Industrial Grants"
 JER_national_factories_desc:0 "Creating a business is hard, and it's even harder to maintain one.

 JER_welfare_shit:0 "The Welfare State"
 JER_welfare_shit_desc:0 "It is the resposibility of the nation to take care of their citizens and provide them financial aid, healthcare and education.

 JER_oil_refinery:0 "Synthetic Oil Experiments"
 JER_oil_refinery_desc:0 "Aquileia possesses no natural oil deposits within its current borders, and we have thus been reduced to relying on foreign trade to supply the economy's ever-growing thirst for oil. Investing in the construction of several synthetic oil refineries to ensure that we are not deprived of our petroleum supply during wartime is necessary, as a modern military cannot fight without oil."
 JER_domestic_arms:0 "The Military-Industrial Complex"
 JER_domestic_arms_desc:0 "By forging an alliance between our army and the industries that supply it, we can ensure that the full might of Aquileian industry is focused on supporting the military.

 JER_infrasctructure_program:0 "Divisions du Travail"
 JER_infrasctructure_program_desc:0 "Ever since the pathetic revolutionaries that attempted to overthrow the government were crushed, we have found ourselves with a large number of prisoners sitting in our dungeons.

 JER_corporate_industry_development:0 "Lower the Income Tax"
 JER_corporate_industry_development_desc:0 "Aquileia maintains a fairly high income tax, and while this does produce a large amount of funds to put towards government projects, it has also discouraged rich griffons from investing in new industries within the nation.

 JER_the_illegal_dam_desc:0 "The idea of damming the river near Westkeep has long been considered an enticing one, with the potential to produce truly immense amounts of electricity if the project were ever to be completed. While construction has been progressing at a steady pace, directly investing in the project would allow it to finish years ahead of schedule, and make the benefits from the endeavor available for our use."
 JER_the_pridea_shipyards:0 "The Shipyards of Pridea"
 JER_the_pridea_shipyards_desc:0 "Pridea has long been considered an important port within Aquileia, with the dockyards of the city having produced a sizable amount of ships for our navy over the years. By expanding the shipyards already present and constructing new ones, we can greatly expand the naval production capacity of our nation."
 JER_the_orvaillo_mines:0 "The Orvalillo Coal Mines"
 JER_the_orvaillo_mines_desc:0 "Orvalillo has long been one of the largest sources of coal within Auqelia, having supplied the country and surrounding areas with coal for years. But recent instability within the region has forced the mines to close, leaving a large source of coal within Aquileia unexploited. Financing the reopening and expansion of the mines would be trivial, and the benefits would make themselves obvious within weeks."
 JER_the_oil_fields_of_greifwald:0 "The Oil Fields of Bois-Grypés"
 JER_the_oil_fields_of_greifwald_desc:0 "The area of Bois-Grypés, which the Imperials call Greifwald, has recently been reincorporated back into Aquileia, and the vast oil fields of the region are now at our disposal. The fields themselves are far from capacity, and expanding the existing drilling operations in the area would provide us with a large amount of oil to fuel the ever-expanding economy."
 JER_modern_industrial_methods:0 "Modern Industrial Methods"
 JER_modern_industrial_methods_desc:0 "Aquileian industry is far from modern, with many factories using equipment that is hopelessly out of date. Thankfully, through the establishment of the Academy of Practical Science, we have attracted several industry experts to our country, ones that are ready to launch a program of modernizing the vast industries of Aquileia."
 JER_electronics_effort:0 "Electronic Investments"
 JER_electronics_effort_desc:0 "The continued advancements in the field of electronics have made it clear that the future is electric. We have reached a point where electronic machines have become vital in many industries, and especially within the army. We cannot afford to lag behind our rivals in this field, and financing new electronic projects will ensure that we keep pace with the rest of the world."
 JER_racial_research:0 "The Vyzima Cultural Institute"
 JER_racial_research_desc:0 "Aquileian culture is the envy of the world, with the sophisticated and elegant ways of the Aquileian griffons being known across the world. Establishing a new institute in Vyzima to sponsor the continued development of our culture will surely be a popular move with the griffons. Such an institute would also allow us to expand our research efforts into magical enchantments, a field we would be fools to ignore."
 JER_nuclear_research:0 "Project Grand Garçon"
 JER_nuclear_research_desc:0 "Crystals have the potential to unleash truly devastating amounts of energy in an incredibly short time. Some even theorize that the ability to wipe entire cities from the map will soon be available to those to harness the power of crystals. This new force must be researched quickly, as our enemies are no doubt doing the very same, and as such a project to research and develop the first weapon of mass destruction shall start."
 JER_a_beautiful_city:0 "The Jewel of the West"
 JER_a_beautiful_city_desc:0 "Our capital Aquila is a city of great culture and industry, and ever since its founding, has been considered the jewel of western Griffonia. And despite everything that our great nation has suffered through the decades, the jewel of the west is still the envy of the world. If Aquila is to maintain its position as a great city, then we must invest in expanding and developing it."
 
 JER_navy_reform:0 "La Marine Nationale"
 JER_navy_reform_desc:0 "With the Nation unified once again, there is one more slight on our honour which has to be repaired. When the nation was broken apart, so was much of the navy partitioned amongst the Discrets. Now that Aquileia is a nation once again, the Marine Nationale will be reforged once more!"
 JER_cat_base_strike_f:0 "Whitequill's Naval Aviation"
 JER_cat_base_strike_f_desc:0 "Gunther Whitequill is a naval theorist from a noble Heartlander family, but his naval theory is most innovative. He proposes a navy centred on aircraft carriers, ships that could house squadrons of naval bombers which can sink conventional enemy ships before they even reach firing range, or even while they are still in port. Aquileia must embrace naval aviation!"
 JER_cat_trade_interdiction_f:0 "Rousselot's Modern Piracy"
 JER_cat_trade_interdiction_f_desc:0 "We must face the fact that we lack the naval tradition of the Imperials or the Wingbardians. It may well be possible that we will not be able to out build our main competitors on the sea. Albert Rousselot has a solution for us. Forego naval engagements in favour of raiding the enemy's supplies. Even with a smaller investment, we can hit our foe where it hurts. "
 JER_cat_fleet_in_being_f:0 "Aquileios' Grand Fleet"
 JER_cat_fleet_in_being_f_desc:0 "A nation's stature is determined by the size of her fleet. We must forbid any dishonourable tactics from our fleet, lest it will bring shame to our nation. Instead, Aquileia will have the grandest fleet of any nation. Our navy will inspire awe in the sailors of lesser fleets and our battleships will make short work of those who dare oppose us!"
 JER_naval_planes_f:0 "Naval Aviation Experimentation"
 JER_naval_planes_f_desc:0 "Aircraft Carriers bring their own challenges to aircraft design. Carrier planes will have to take off and land with a shorter runway. The standard aircraft models simply will not work under these conditions. With scientific rigour, we will discover what works and what doesn't and soon we will be able to fill our carriers with their deadly cargo."
 JER_heavy_cruiser_f:0 "Commission New Battlecruisers"
 JER_heavy_cruiser_f_desc:0 "A capital ship comes in many sizes, but the battlecruiser model will be the mainstay of our surface attack groups. Relatively cheap to produce, but still a cut above any cruiser, these ships are already the mainstay of our fleet. Modernising these battlecruisers will be an easy way to increase our navy's potency. "
 JER_destroyer_f:0 "The Trade Fleet"
 JER_destroyer_f_desc:0 "Aquileia, being a modern nation by all standards, is deeply embedded in the global trade system and our merchant marine sail the world's ocean, flying our colours with pride! However, these ships are in danger from pirates and submarines when unescorted. Modern destroyers will be able to patrol our waters and fend off any attack on our trade vessels."
 JER_light_cruiser_f:0 "Light Cruiser Experimentation"
 JER_light_cruiser_f_desc:0 "Specialisation may be a luxury we cannot afford right now, but cruisers are the answers to our troubles. These ships are versatile and can fill many roles within the fleet. Light cruisers can serve as heavy destroyers, protecting our trade, while heavier cruisers will be able to serve as capital ships for any task group which lacks a battlecruiser. Let us specialise in an all-round fleet."
 JER_battleships_f:0 "The Grandest Ships"
 JER_battleships_f_desc:0 "Our fleet must equal the prestige and glory of the rest of the nation and therefore we cannot lag behind in the construction of battleships. These beautiful ships, manned by our best sailors, will be the pride of the nation. Wherever they go, all will be amazed at our beautiful battleships!"
 JER_expand_the_dockyards:0 "Expand the Shipyards"
 JER_expand_the_dockyards_desc:0 "If our grand plans are to be enacted in a timely fashion, our naval facilities must be expanded. We will construct two new dry docks in Aquila and expand the naval base in the area. There will always be griffons in the underbelly of the city looking for a job, so it will be no problem to get these dry docks working. "
 JER_carrier_experiments:0 "Carrier Experiments"
 JER_carrier_experiments_desc:0 "Fleet Carriers are at the cutting edge of our technological capabilities. They will not only be required to launch and house squadrons of fighters. They need countermeasures against aircraft and submarines and a way to house the crew and pilots, while simultaneously functioning as a mobile command centre for a fleet commander or admiral. For Aquileia, we will see it done."
 JER_submarine_experiments:0 "The Hidden Fleet"
 JER_submarine_experiments_desc:0 "When we looks at the immense ocean that lies before us, our very eyes are deceiving us. We are looking at a mirror which jealously guards the secret of what hides below its surface. While our battleships and carriers distract our unwitting foes, the hidden fleet sails below the mirror, undisturbed. And when the ocean finally reveals her secrets, it will have been too late. . ."
 JER_further_expansion:0 "Le Maître-Port"
 JER_further_expansion_desc:0 "Aquila is not only our undisputed capital and the centre of arts, science and civilisation, but it is also quickly becoming the home of our fleet. Many a chanson tells our sailors’ desire to see the piers of home once again and to the cacophony of sounds emanating from her docks. We must use this inspiration to work ever harder on our fleet, so that her size may inspire jealousy in our rivals."
 JER_doctrinal_development:0 "New Élan"
 JER_doctrinal_development_desc:0 "Our efforts to reinvigorate the Marine Nationale has not gone unnoticed by the citizenry. New sailors are being mustered every day and we simply lack the capacity to educate everygriffon wishing to be an officer. This new talent will surely server us well!"
 JER_naval_academy:0 "l’Académie Navale de la Pridée"
 JER_naval_academy_desc:0 "Pridea has had custody over a large part of the national navy while our nation was divided.

We will reopen and expand this institution, so that we can train all the hopeful officers of the future."
 JER_marine_f:0 "Troupes de la Marine"
 JER_marine_f_desc:0 "Controlling the ocean is but the first step in securing the enemy lands and forcing a surrender. Unfortunately, enemy beaches tend to be well fortified obstacles. The Marine Nationale will be expanded with the Troupes de la Marine. These elite infantry units are specialised in ship to ship warfare and amphibious operations. With them, we will be able to follow up a successful naval strike with a proper invasion."
 JER_landing_craft_f:0 "Improve Our Landing Craft"
 JER_landing_craft_f_desc:0 "The Troupes de la Marine need to actually get to the coast, if we are to launch any successful invasion. Although we considered letting the marines fly towards the enemy, an airborne approach makes them easy targets for enemy fire. We will have to design all-weather armoured transports to protect them until they can get in effective firing range."
 JER_expanding_the_marines:0 "Expand the Troupes de la Marine"
 JER_expanding_the_marines_desc:0 "The marines are the elite of our armed forces, but sadly there are just not enough of them at the moment. This is nothing that a few inspiring speeches, a few visits to the countryside and a more forgiving recruitment standard can't fix! Let us get to work to expand our special forces to the level where they are not only a tactical, but a strategic threat."
 JER_semper_fi:0 "Premier Au Combat"
 JER_semper_fi_desc:0 "Our honourable and unbeaten forces hunger for battle! To follow the banner of Aquileia means to not fear battle, but to seek it!

 JER_the_greatest_fleet:0 "La Grande Flotte"
 JER_the_greatest_fleet_desc:0 "The renaissance of our fleet has seen our neglected navy grow into the pride of the nation. Many in our nation equal the rise of the navy to the rise of Aquileia as a whole, and there may be some truth in that. However, we are far from done. With ever increasing vigour and meticulous diligence, our fleet will grow in size, until it will outshine all who dare thread the ocean fair!"
 
 JER_new_airforce:0 "Armée de l'Air Aquiléenne"

 JER_astrium_contract:0 "The Astrium Contract"
 JER_astrium_contract_desc:0 "Astrium Aviation is seeking an exclusive contract with the government.

We will take Astrium up on their offer and consider an air army based around ground support."
 JER_safran_contract:0 "The Safran Contract"
 JER_safran_contract_desc:0 "Safran has caught wind of our efforts to increase the capabilities of our aircraft.

 JER_thales_contract:0 "The Thales Contract"
 JER_thales_contract_desc:0 "Thales seeks to produce heavier aircraft for our airfleet. The company is known for their reliable tractors and they maintain that their engines will work just as well in the air. Of course, if they are to devote themselves to the aircraft industry, they will require government incentive."
 JER_fighter_f:0 "The Falcons of Aquileia"
 JER_fighter_f_desc:0 "In the days of old, our chivalrous knights would duel in the skies, for the honour of their liege or the attention of a fair lady! Those days are past, as our knights now wear rifles into combat and duelling is outlawed. The legacy of these aerial warriors lives on in the courageous falcons, our fighter pilots. These duellists will outclass any opponent!"
 JER_heavier_fighters:0 "Armour for our Falcons"
 JER_heavier_fighters_desc:0 "Modern duels, sadly, are way more dangerous than back in the days of chivalry. Our falcons fly in agile craft with ample firepower, but one bad hit can send them spiralling down to their untimely deaths. To prevent this, we must provide our falcons with the best armour these planes can carry!"
 JER_bomber_f:0 "Bomber Experiments"
 JER_bomber_f_desc:0 "The impact of aerial warfare on the ground is not to be underestimated. Large aircraft can carry a payload of bombs that can obliterate an armoured column or even a factory! However, to strike with any measure of precision, we will have to do more than simply have passenger craft throw out bombs from the sky. We need specialised bomber planes."
 JER_strat_bomber_f:0 "Strategic Destruction"
 JER_strat_bomber_f_desc:0 "Smaller bombers can have an impact on a tactical scale, taking out a key enemy position or production facility. However, a war is rarely won in a single battle.

 JER_flight_academy:0 "l'Institut d'Aérodynamique"
 JER_flight_academy_desc:0 "l'Institute d'Aérodynamique de Aquileia was one of the pioneers of motorised flight when the invention reached our continent, but it remains at the centre of innovation! Investing into the institute will help us to teach new pilots and improve our airplanes!"
 JER_CAS_f:0 "Supporting Our Troops"
 JER_CAS_f_desc:0 "Although airplanes offer incredible mobility, they mean nothing if our forces on the ground get obliterated. We need to make an effort to produce smaller, agile bombers that can support the troops. When we come from above, our enemy will never sleep safely again."
 JER_no_trees:0 "No Trees Left Standing"
 JER_no_trees_desc:0 "The stakes in modern war are beyond reasonable. Everything is gambled, the very soul of our nation, everything that makes us Aquileian.

 JER_fund_meshoiro_partisans:0 "Arm The Clubs"
 JER_fund_meshoiro_partisans_desc:0 "A revolution cannot succeed on fiery speeches and passionate protests alone. If we are to plot the downfall of the monarchy, we must make sure all our members are armed and ready to fight. It is time to ensure that the clubs throughout Rila are ready to stand with us when the time comes and bring us the heads of every noble that escaped our wrath the first time around."
 JER_support_rebels_in_pridea:0 "Ignite The Spark"
 JER_support_rebels_in_pridea_desc:0 "When Dennis Discret seized control of Pridea at the end of the last revolution, his reign of terror left hundreds of revolutionaries dead by the Weeping Wall in the old city, executed mercilessly one after the other until his hold on the city was secure. The griffons that yet dream of revolution are too terrified to say so openly, but if no griffon is willing to take a stand and fight for their freedom, how can Dennis' grip on Pridea slip? It is time we remind revolutionary sympathizers throughout Pridea that there are worse things to fear than death, and the continued grip of tyranny is but one of them."
 JER_assassinate_police_officers:0 "High Priority Targets"
 JER_assassinate_police_officers_desc:0 "The ponies of Pridea betrayed us. They betrayed their chance at freedom by siding with the Baron when he took Pridea back, and now they feast on the scraps he gives them from his table. They forfeited their rights to join us in revolution when they chose tyranny over freedom. Let's remind them that traitors get what's coming to them in the end, and send Dennis' pony gendarmerie the heads of their commanders..."
 JER_infiltrate_dockyards:0 "The Key To The Revolution"
 JER_infiltrate_dockyards_desc:0 "Pridea's navy is the key to Baron Dennis' hold on the barony. During the Revolution, his fleet pummeled Pridea from afar, flattening large swaths of the city and indiscriminately murdering hundreds with his merciless shelling. Were revolution to break out again, Dennis would have no reservations about razing the rest of the city with his navy once more. We must interfere with his ability to launch new ships and ensure that when the time comes, his navy cannot leave port and destroy the city - and our dreams of a revolutionary Pridea."
 JER_fund_colette:0 "Support Colette"
 JER_fund_colette_desc:0 "Colonel Colette, though once a subordinate of General Thomas Reiany and complicit in his dismantling of the revolution in Westkeep, has worked equally as hard to keep the nobility and Marquise Aurél Discret from retaking control of the march. She seems to be no friend of the monarchists; perhaps it's time to see if the enemy of our enemy can be our friend."
 JER_target_monarchist_MPA:0 "Target The Monarchists"
 JER_target_monarchist_MPA_desc:0 "There are many in the MPA and Colette's soldiers in Westkeep that harbor monarchist sympathies. Rather than letting them lend their support and weapons to the monarchists in the coming revolution, let us preemptively purge them from Colette's party - with her support, of course."
 JER_make_ties:0 "Expand The Cells"
 JER_make_ties_desc:0 "Moreso than General Reiany's intervention, the state of anarchy that ruled Westkeep during the Revolution led to the march's downfall and return to the kingdom. This time around, we shall make sure our revolutionary cells are larger, better equipped, and better trained. Westkeep will no longer yield so easily to the monarchist armies this time around."
 JER_support_the_commies:0 "Support PAT-M in Vinovia"
 JER_support_the_commies_desc:0 "Vinovia is a land divided between numerous parties and ideologies, all held barely in check by Duke Gadiffer. If we lend our support to the communists movement in the duchy, they might in turn be able to aid us in furthering our goals."
 JER_support_the_democrats:0 "Support the FJA in Vinovia"
 JER_support_the_democrats_desc:0 "Duke Gadiffer's hold on Vinovia is maintained through a careful balancing act of keeping revolutionary sentiment under control and appeasing the factions throughout the duchy. If we can press the harmonists to throw their weight behind the revolution and cease yielding to the duke's honeyed words, then Vinovia will be ripe for the taking."
 JER_send_supplies:0 "Supply The Cells"
 JER_send_supplies_desc:0 "The duke's careful control over weapons and supplies throughout his duchy has left the revolutionary cells scattered throughout weak and ineffectual. That weakness leads to them bowing their heads before the duke instead of removing his from his body. If we arm the cells, however, then they won't be so easily cowed or charmed by Gadiffer's speeches."
 
 JER_JRR_the_lady_and_the_countess:0 "The Colonel and The Marquise."
 JER_JRR_the_lady_and_the_countess_desc:0 "Colonel Colette has been using her control over Westkeep's military and the support of the MPA to keep Marquise Aurél Discret from claiming her rightful rule over the march for almost a year now. It is time to finally have a reckoning between these two griffons with the fate of the Marquisate at stake."
 JER_JRR_rev_crush_the_FJA:0 "Ensure the FJA Plays their part."
 JER_JRR_rev_crush_the_FJA_desc:0 "We must all do our part to keep Westkeep safe and secure, to prevent the return of the nobility and their lavish and careless lifestyle. Such decadence nearly destroyed Westkeep once, and we must all rally together to ensure it doesn't happen again. The FJA, though they may have different ideas about how to run Westkeep, must recognize that Colette's rule is the best course of action, and give her their support."
 JER_JRR_rev_crush_the_anarchists:0 "Keep the Socialists in line."
 JER_JRR_rev_crush_the_anarchists_desc:0 "The Socialists of the PAT-M have grand ideas on how to revolutionize life for the griffons of Westkeep; however, they forget that to even bring about change in the Marquisate, we must first hold it against the nobility. Acting independently weakens us all, and a soldier out of the line is a chink the enemy can exploit. The Socialists will fall back in line behind Colonel Colette - or else."
 JER_JRR_rev_secure_republican_backing:0 "Secure Revolutionary Leadership"
 JER_JRR_rev_secure_republican_backing_desc:0 "Outside of Colette and her trusted officers, Westkeep desperately wants for trusted and competent officers to lead it. The revolutionaries, however, have experience fighting against the armies of the king. Turning to them for aid will give us experienced officers that will help our armies fight better when the time for bloodshed comes."
 JER_JRR_rev_blame_nobility:0 "The Root of Our Issues."
 JER_JRR_rev_blame_nobility_desc:0 "All of the problems in Westkeep stem from one thing: the unchecked decadence and debauchery of the nobility. We must take a stand against this wasteless and heedless lifestyle, for the good of all the griffons of Westkeep."

aquileia_news.1.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]The Kingdom of Aquileia, for the second time in recent history, is embroiled in revolutionary turmoil, the so called Second Aquileian Revolution. Republican and communist supporters have managed to quickly overwhelm, apprehend or eliminate loyalist forces in several regions, throwing the country into chaos.\n\nThe Republic is fiercely opposed by the monarchist supporters, who have sworn to destroy the revolutionary spirit once and for all. The Republic braces itself for the coming storm, ready to defend their ideals and values to the death."

After much bloodshed and many atrocities, the region is once again at peace, with the Republic now firmly established.\n\nThe future of the Republic remains uncertain, however, as the temporary alliance of communists and republicans breaks apart in the light of the upcoming first General Election.

Francistria had seized it from Aquileia during the tumultuous times of the First Revolution, when the local Countess had been executed and the republicans had tenuous control over the area.\n\nThe ultimatum has officially been rejected, and Aquileia has used this to justify open war. [WNG.GetLeader] of Wingbardy has shown great concern over this and has vowed to intervene if necessary."

### Leader Descs ###
JER_vivienne_desc:0 "§YBorn:§! May 9th, 983\n\n§YBiography:§! Born far from the kingdom her family ruled, Vivienne Discret’s first memories were not of the royal halls of the palace in Aquileia, but of the warm white walls of the Saddle Arabian emir’s court. Aquileia was in chaos, with the death throes of the Revolution turning the rivers red with blood. The Discret family tree had been sheared of its branches by the guillotine, leaving only five surviving dynasts to escape, with Vivienne as the future of the royal lineage. As forces loyal to the monarchy secured their kingdom for them, the royal family waited out the bloodshed from afar, safe from the chaos.\n\nWhen she finally returned to Aquileia, she was immediately surrounded with a veritable army of tutors and scholars. Given the disposition of her father, however, many doubted that the young princess would be keen to learn what they had to say. Fortunately, Vivienne took to her studies and learned well. Better still, they became her passion. The young griffoness read any books she could get her talons on, and touring the countryside became as important to her as her studies. All who met her found her charming and instantly disarming, her wit leaving them impressed for a griffon barely an adult. The nobility of Aquileia and those loyal to the crown knew that the kingdom would be in good claws when it was her turn to take the throne, and many hoped behind closed doors that some unfortunate accident would befall Moriset so his talented and ambitious daughter could take the throne.\n\nThey would be granted their wish. With the Second Aquileian Revolution leaving King Moriset dead, the future of the kingdom lies in the claws of Princess Vivienne – now Queen Vivienne Discret.\n\n§YPortrait by:§! Echo"

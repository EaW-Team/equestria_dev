 JER_memories:0 "Memories of the Republic"
 JER_memories_desc:0 "Shortly after the collapse of the Griffonian Empire the Kingdom of Aquileia experienced a revolution of its own.\n\nThe Revolution itself abolished the Discret Monarchy, and resulted in the proclamation of the First Aquileian Republic with Theodore Vérany at its head. Unfortunately, only five years after the Republic was created Marshal Berthelot led a counter-revolution which resulted in the Discret Restoration.\n\nIn spite of the Restoration there are still many within the country who refuse to let go of the dream of an Aquileian Republic thus making King Moriset's hold on the country tenuous at best."

 ### Events ###
 aquileia.1.t:0 "Weapons From The Capital"
 aquileia.1.d:0 "A large delivery of weapons has come from Aquila, courtesy of the royal armoury. With revolutionary tensions rising, these weapons likely will be invaluable in the coming months."
 aquileia.1.a:0 "Magnifique!"
 
 aquileia.2.t:0 "The Chouette Raids"
 aquileia.2.d:0 "The secret police has been on the move recently. Through their usual methods - unsavory as they are - they have revealed several revolutionary headquarters and raided them in the middle of the night. Hopefully, this will be enough to thwart the rebels."
 aquileia.2.a:0 "This will force the rats into the open..."
 
 aquileia.3.t:0 "The Pony March"
 aquileia.3.d:0 "A grand march through the countryside took place this week. Ponies, numbering in the thousands, marched from Pelis to Rila, holding royal banners and placards with pro-royalist slogans on them. In every village they passed more ponies join them, and as they reached Rila they filled the city square, singing the Royal Hymn and declaring their loyalty to the crown."
 aquileia.3.a:0 "Glad to see our Equine friends are still supporting us"
 
 aquileia.4.t:0 "Republicans Within the MPA Arrested"
 aquileia.4.d:0 "It seems that the local MPA have had greater issues than we suspected. The Chouette, acting on orders from Aquila, arrested over a dozen high ranking MPA members on charges of revolutionary activities."
 aquileia.4.a:0 "How Embarrassing"
 
 aquileia.5.t:0 "A Visit to Vinovia"
 aquileia.5.d:0 "Vinovia has been graced by the presence of the royal family. With tensions high, many had feared that a visit from the tempramental king would only make things worse, but thankfully the visitor turned out to be princess Vivienne. The princess, as charming as any griffin could be, took her time with both commoner and noble and was all smiles and delight. Even with the possibility of revolution ahead, for one evening the princess managed to assuage fears and give a moment of joy to all."
 aquileia.5.a:0 "Thank Eyr Moriset sent Vivienne instead..."
 
 aquileia.6.t:0 "Letting Loose"
 aquileia.6.d:0 "So the revolutionary rats have crawled out of their holes again to make a mess of things, have they? Well, if they did not learn the last time, it seems we will have to teach them a lesson again. Let's make sure we are suitably excessive this time around."
 aquileia.6.a:0 "Violence solves most things"
 
 aquileia.7.t:0 "Search And Destroy"
 aquileia.7.d:0 "Pridean forces have struck all over Pridea, dragging the traitors and their sympathisers out of their holes kicking and screaming. The citizens are too afraid to defy us, knowing the price of treason, and by the time we're done there will not be a single rat left in all of Pridea!"
 aquileia.7.a:0 "None can hide from us!"
 
 aquileia.8.t:0 "Friends In the MPA"
 aquileia.8.d:0 "It seems the MPA have been receiving aid from Aquila. That's splendid news as it means that there's more fighters out there, willing to fight for Aquileia. "
 aquileia.8.a:0 "Magnifique"
 
 aquileia.9.t:0 "Rila Holds"
 aquileia.9.d:0 "The revolutionaries came, and the revolutionaries failed. They thought they could break Rila, but it broke them instead. Raise the royal banner high, Rila Holds!"
 aquileia.9.a:0 "Hurray!"
 
 aquileia.10.t:0 "The Revolution in Rila"
 aquileia.10.d:0 "Early this morning, the Duke fled Rila after the streets were blocked by revolutionaries and several military units declared for the Republic! Things are still chaotic and the road ahead is long, but with the Jewel of the North in our claws, it is clear that the first great step has been taken!"
 aquileia.10.a:0 "Long live the Republic!"
 
 aquileia.11.t:0 "Monarchist MPA Coup"
 aquileia.11.d:0 "The revolutionaries had sunk their claws deep into Westkeep, but early this morning the loyalist MPA launched a counter-coup, securing the capitol and declaring their intent to stand by the King."
 aquileia.11.a:0 "Long live the Discrets!"
 
 aquileia.12.t:0 "The Revolution in Westkeep"
 aquileia.12.d:0 "The MPA are patriots, but that means they believe in Aquileia, not the Discrets. Westkeep has declared for the revolution. It is time to throw down these old tyrants and free the people of Aquileia."
 aquileia.12.a:0 "For the Revolution and the Aquileian people!"
 
 aquileia.13.t:0 "Vinovia Holds"
 aquileia.13.d:0 "It seemed like disaster might strike, but in the end, the Duke's leadership has seen us through, and the revolutionaries have failed in their objectives. Despite the chaos in the streets, all reports say that the loylaist forces are driving them back and the rightful order remains intact."
 aquileia.13.a:0 "As if there was ever any doubt"
 
 aquileia.14.t:0 "The Revolution in Vinovia"
 aquileia.14.d:0 "Down with the tyrants! Our forces have secured the Ducal palace and the outlying regions of the capitol. Raise high the banner of Vinovia and march forth! We march for freedom, to victory!"
 aquileia.14.a:0 "For the Revolution and the Vinovian people!"
 
 aquileia.15.t:0 "Pridea Holds"
 aquileia.15.d:0 "Despite the efforts of the traitors and revolutionaries, Pridea remains loyal to the crown. They tried their best, but it was all for naught, and it seems we are dragging more traitors to the wall again."
 aquileia.15.a:0 "Magnifique!"
 
 aquileia.16.t:0 "The Revolution"
 aquileia.16.d:0 "In a stunning display of boldness and élan, former exile Théodore Vérany returned to Aquileia, an army of Aquileian peasantry and formerly hidden supporters at his back, and stormed the Royal Palace, capturing the King and proclaiming the creation of the Second Aquileian Republic, as both the Aquileian Republican Army and Socialists fought the Aquileian military in the streets themselves. Time will tell what this means for the country, as it falls once again into bloodshed."
 aquileia.16.a:0 "Long live the Republic!"

 aquileia.17.t:0 "The Day of Reckoning"
 aquileia.17.d:0 "With the surrender of the Royalist forces in the old Aquileian military, the Republican victory was secured, and Monarchy was again abolished within the country. Having to decide what to do in regards to the deposed king, Vérany and his followers decided upon political irony, and sentenced the former king to death by the king’s preferred method of execution: the Guillotine. With his head firmly separated from his body, the King is quite dead, and with him, any hopes of monarchy in Aquileia."
 aquileia.17.a:0 "Sic semper tyranis."

 aquileia.18.t:0 "The Elections"
 aquileia.18.d:0 "With the Second Republic’s victory, the time has come for the important vote that will decide the political future of the feudal country. Everygriff has been incentivised to vote, and vote collectors are beginning to scour the countryside. The people of Aquileia have three major choices for head of state to choose from: Théodore Vérany, Hero Of both the First and the Second Aquileian Revolution, and running on the platform of free markets and liberal rights for each and every griffon. Cécile Gaudreau, of the Aquileian Worker’s Party- a moderate socialist looking to blend socialism and capitalism into a well-oiled and fluid state. Or, finally, Victor Allard- another influential member of the PAT and radical leftist, preaching purely socialist ideals, often times citing Stalliongradian methods in his public speeches."
 aquileia.18.a:0 "FJA retains a majority and Théodore Vérany remains president!"
 aquileia.18.b:0 "PAT-M gains a majority under Cécile Gaudreau!"
 aquileia.18.c:0 "PAT-R gains a majority under Victor Allard!"

 aquileia.19.t:0 "The Loose Ends"
 aquileia.19.d:0 "In a grimly political move, the current government swiftly and methodically dealt with what it felt were several loose ends within the PAT, as agents of the Aquileian government were reported to execute potentially hostile elements in their perceived opposition. Notables include several political and military advisory griffons for the government, as well as Field Marshall Victor Moreau who was shot, and General Félix Murat, who was reportedly poisoned."
 aquileia.19.a:0 "Another threat to the establishment dealt with."

 aquileia.20.t:0 "The New Republic"
 aquileia.20.d:0 "With his political victory secure, Victor Allard proclaimed the formation of the Aquileian People’s Republic today, and announced several relatively fast reformation plans for the country, as he solidifies his new government. Decrying the Capitalist Bourgeoisie as Monarchist Shills, Allard has spoken out radically against liberal as Monarchist forms of government, proclaiming that Socialism is the proper way forward for the country."
 aquileia.20.a:0 "It's good to be the General Secretary."

 aquileia.21.t:0 "The Exile of Victor Allard"
 aquileia.21.d:0 "In a shocking move today, the PAT and FJA came together in the government to publicly disavow and declare Persona-Non-grata Victor Allard, a formerly major influence within the PAT, and radical socialist. Personally disgusted with the turn of events, and wanting nothing else to do with politics, Allard left the country today in self-imposed Exile, to whereabouts unknown."
 aquileia.21.a:0 "Another threat to the establishment dealt with."

 aquileia.22.t:0 "A New Republic"
 aquileia.22.d:0 "Today marks a historic day in Aquileian history. Building upon their success during the Revolution and learned lessons during our political times of turmoil, the Democratic government has announced the gradual reform of our government into a proper Federated Republic, as a Republic is more capable than a direct democracy, without threatening the voice of the average griffon."
 aquileia.22.a:0 "Long live the Federation!"

 aquileia.23.t:0 "An Invitation to the Entente"
 aquileia.23.d:0 "It seems that the Aquileians being quite proud of their new Republic have decided to invite us into something called the Entente - apparently it is intended to be an alliance of Democracies in Griffonia and would provide both financial and military assistance to all members. Should we join?"
 aquileia.23.a:0 "We will join."
 aquileia.23.b:0 "We don't need the Aquileians."

 aquileia.24.t:0 "Skyfall Accepts"
 aquileia.24.d:0 "Skyfall has accepted our invitation."
 aquileia.24.a:0 "Wonderful."

 aquileia.25.t:0 "Skyfall Refuses"
 aquileia.25.d:0 "Skyfall has declined our invitation."
 aquileia.25.a:0 "Oh bollocks..."

 aquileia.26.t:0 "An Invitation to the Entente"
 aquileia.26.d:0 "It seems that the Aquileians being quite proud of their new Republic have decided to invite us into something called the Entente - apparently it is intended to be an alliance of Democracies in Griffonia and would provide both financial and military assistance to all members. Should we join?"
 aquileia.26.a:0 "Why not?"
 aquileia.26.b:0 "We don't need the Aquileians."

 aquileia.27.t:0 "The Republic Accepts"
 aquileia.27.d:0 "The Griffonian Republic has accepted."
 aquileia.27.a:0 "Wonderful!"

 aquileia.28.t:0 "The Republic Declines"
 aquileia.28.d:0 "The Griffonian Republic had declined."
 aquileia.28.a:0 "Bollocks!"

 aquileia.29.t:0 "The Fate of the Kingdom"
 aquileia.29.d:0 "Upon the insistence of Marshal Rodier, a strict Ultranationalist dedicated to all things Aquileian, the king must now decide whether to stand firm and remain the absolute monarch of Aquileia, to whom all power resides, or to allow the Marshal and his cronies into the government as a prime minister, supposedly to provide support for the king whilst calming the Ultranationalists in government."
 aquileia.29.a:0 "The Maréchal has some interesting ideas."
 aquileia.29.b:0 "The King's rule is absolute."

 aquileia.30.t:0 "The Death of Marshal Berthelot"
 aquileia.30.d:0 "Marshal Berthelot, the griffon most responsible for the destruction of the First Aquileian Republic and the restoration of Moriset Discret to the throne of Aquileia passed away today at the age of 87. The old Marshal was found dead in his manor in Vyzima by one of his servants, a quick examination proved that Berthelot had passed away naturally and a funeral procession was organised by his family and friends. Although Berthelot is seen as a hero by some Aquileians the majority of our people considered him a scoundrel and a lackey of the Discret family, thus making both him and his death a deeply dividing matter."
 aquileia.30.b:0 "Rest in peace old friend."

 aquileia.39.t:0 "The Maréchal Leaves"
 aquileia.39.d:0 "To the surprise of many, Marshal Rodier whom up until recently had been rather receptive of the new Republican Government has decided to leave Aquileia, apparently the Marshal declared the MPA a failed organisation and Aquileia a dead nation, and left for the Griffonian Empire, what he will do next is anyone's guess."
 aquileia.39.a:0 "Good riddance."
 
 aquileia.41.t:0 "The Pascal Affair"
 aquileia.41.d:0 "The Republic is gripped with suspicion and paranoia as an artillery officer within our fair republic's army was placed under arrested, having been suspected of sending letters to correspondents within the Empire! To think that one of our fair citizens would attempt to exchange information and secrets with the power-hungry despots in Griffenheim is horrifying and almost unbelievable! There in lies the problem however, independent investigations have concluded that Pascal was not sending these letters, after interviewing his fellow officers as well as his own family. They considered him a "True Patriot to the Republic, and would give his life for it." Many suspect that the Policegriffons sent to arrest him placed these false documents within his home, and that these griffons were agents of the MPA, hoping to stir up anti-pony sentiment. Whatever the case may be, all Ponies within the republic are to be closely watched now."
 aquileia.41.a:0 "These are not our republican ideals!"
 
 aquileia.42.t:0 "Zolavi Passes Away"
 aquileia.42.d:0 "Notable journalist and novelist Émile Zolavi has recently died, in his old home on the Aquilan outskirts. His writing career has inspired a new trend in Aquileian culture, short-lived as it was, and his outspoken approach even convinced the government to loosing their grip on the society. His most notorious action, however, was a full scale condemnation of the ruling officials during the Pascal affair. His caustic, inflammatory accusation spared none, and he was quickly sued for libel. As a result, Zolavi escaped abroad to New Mareland, where he continued to defend his close friend Pascal. He was only recently permitted to return, but the stress of his prosecution has left him weary of life. The government of Aquileia has decided to name their newly formed literature prize after Zolavi, to honour his contribution to society. "
 aquileia.42.a:0 "His books weren't that bad, really."
 
 aquileia.43.t:0 "Rabble-rousing Griffon Causes Mischief"
 aquileia.43.d:0 "Voracious lover of life and dandy, Charles Beaklaire was well known in the artistic circles of Aquila for his rather divisive poetry. While a vocal minority considered his work to be a rejuvenation of art, far more considered them to be works of complete debauchery. The numerous lawsuits and charges of defiling public morals have not deterred Beaklaire from publishing more verses on themes of modernity, love and wine. Additionally, he has taken it personally to confront his critics, causing multiple public brawls. This has resulted in many griffons receiving serious injuries, as Beaklaire is overly fond of the bottle, and great damage to public property. Recently however, his brief stint in the prison has somewhat mellowed him out, yet his works continue to cause much controversy in the cafés of Aquila."
 aquileia.43.a:0 "Artists are a rather special bunch."
 
 aquileia.44.t:0 "Plumus Publishes L’Étranger"
 aquileia.44.d:0 "Albert Plumus is a name that has quickly risen in the artistic circles of Aquileia. His absurdist approach towards life, which is widespread in his works, has attracted many griffons, weary of the constant wars raging across the world. He has recently finished his newest novel, titled L’Étranger (The Outsider), which follows Griffsault and his indifferent lifestyle. The critics praised the main character's disposition towards life, authority and religion, stating that these are the proper values for the uncertain times. Thus, the book has quickly became an integral part of any Aquileian's shelf."
 aquileia.44.a:0 "Remind me not to look at the sun."
 
 aquileia.45.t:0 "The Second Commune of Pridea"
 aquileia.45.d:0 "Today we rise up once again! Despite the tyrants who have tried to keep us in chains, we now rise up in defiance of the monarchists. For the Commune and for Liberty!"
 aquileia.45.a:0 "Long live the Revolution!"
 
 aquileia.46.t:0 "The Second Revolution"
 aquileia.46.d:0 "The worst has come to pass! Despite all our efforts, the revolutionaries have risen up against the crown. Armed militants are in the streets, garrisons have been bombed and the royal palace itself was assaulted by a force of disloyal soldiers.\n\nThe revolutionaries' first attack was beaten back by the valiant Royal Guard, but now the nation is aflame as chaos reigns everywhere. We must rally our forces and strike back at these traitors before they have a chance to achieve their goals."
 aquileia.46.a:0 "We shall crush them once again!"
 
 aquileia.47.t:0 "The End of the Revolution"
 aquileia.47.d:0 "The streets run red with the blood of traitors and patriots alike, but as the dust settles we stand triumphant! The revolutionaries came at us with as great force as during the first revolution, but unlike then we did not fall apart. Instead we have held the line and let them break themselves upon us! Aquileia's royal banner flies high and victorious today!"
 aquileia.47.a:0 "Long live the King!"
 
 aquileia.48.t:0 "The End of the Revolution"
 aquileia.48.d:0 "Despite their plots and schemes, the revolutionary plot failed before it could truly begin. Thanks to the decisive action by our king and our vassals we have managed to nip the revolution in the bud. Aquileia stands firm today as loyalty won out among the people!"
 aquileia.48.a:0 "Long live the King!"
 
 aquileia.49.t:0 "An Unfortunate Incident"
 aquileia.49.d:0 "Terrible news from the royal palace!\n\nDuring one of His Majesty's baths, a servant snuck into the quarters and stabbed him! While the servant was swiftly apprehended by the Royal Guards, it was too late to save His Majesty. At 16:23, His Most Honorable Majesty King Moriset Discret passed away even as the doctors did all they could.\n\n All of Aquileia is in shock from the terrible event, having thought that the revolution was over and yet those damn rebels managed to spite the nation with their last breath. The one small comfort available for us in this dark time is princess Viviane, whom all thought would be paralyzed by grief. Instead, she appeared before the gathered court that very evening, being crowned Queen Vivienne Discret of Aquileia."
 aquileia.49.a:0 "Vive la Reine!"
 
 aquileia.50.t:0 "National Education Effort"
 aquileia.50.d:0 ""A for Aquila, where Her Majesty lives. B for Bread, such as Baguette or Brioche..." Monsieur Mésange said, pointing to the poster with his pointer as the young children in the benches all obediently echoed him.\n\nHe supposed that this was not what he had expected to be doing with his life. Teaching in a small rural town in the depths of Orvaillo had seemed like such a dreary prospect, but it seemed that was where his life had taken him. The state paid a decent salary, and after the recent unrest he found the countryside good for his nerves.\n\nIn the corner of his eye he saw how one of the local farmers, the father of young Lacroix if he wasn't mistaken, was lurking by the door, glancing inside and mouthing along with the lecture. Of course... even the adults around here were illiterate.\n\n"Good afternoon Monsieur Lacroix, are you here for your son?" he decided to ask, the farmgriff startling. Before he could say anything though, Monsieur Mésange continued. "We are not quite finished yet, but please, have a seat. Maybe you can assist me if the children get too rowdy," he said with a smile as he motioned to the back of the classroom to help the farmgriff save face. Somewhat hesitantly, Monsieur Lacroix stepped inside and sat down as Monsieur Mésange returned to the beginning. "Once again now mes élèves: A for Aquila, where Her Majesty lives...""  
 aquileia.50.a:0 "Not very glamorous, but a necessary and honorable duty!"
 
 aquileia.51.t:0 "Literacy Rates Soar"
 aquileia.51.d:0 "Remy's mother was curious about that book that her son had brought home from school. She hadn't at first been too sure about Monsieur Mésange, the city griffon had seemed so stuck-up and distant, and she couldn't understand why her son had to be away for so long to learn all these odd things. They needed him at the farm, after all.\n\nStill, Remy was happy, and he had taken to school like a fish to water. Maybe... she found herself dreaming as she stood by the stove... maybe this would really lead somewhere?\n\nRemy, meanwhile, was utterly absorbed in the book, reading about the strange and distant lands of "Equestria" and its supposedly immortal goddess-queen. Monsieur Mésange had let him borrow it on the condition that he'd perform a presentation on the book in front of the class, and Remy wasn't going to waste this chance. After all, Monsieur Mésange had told him that depending on how things went for him in school, any number of possibilities were open."
 aquileia.51.a:0 "An inquisitive mind is a treasure."

 aquileia.52.d:0 "Remy sat quietly on the chair, his heart pounding as he had his parents to the left and Monsieur Mésange to the right. Having his teacher over at home was strange enough but Monsieur Mésange seemed to have something he wanted to say and only waited for the opening as Remy's mother kept nervously talking, asking for the third time if he'd like some more coffee.\n\n"I am here to discuss your son's efforts in school," the teacher began after a while. "See, Remy has been an exceptional student. He is dilligent and talented in equal measure, and I am convinced that he has the potential to succeed even in higher studies. Therefore," Monsieur Mésange said, smiling at Remy, "I would like to give you a recommendation so that you may go to the Lycée."\n\nRemy tried to say something and accept politely, but the news made his eyes well up and he didn't manage to do anything but to nod as tears of relief and happiness began to flow down his cheeks. Thankfully his father eagerly said yes in his stead as his mother wrapped him in her arms, tears of her own beginning to flow."

 aquileia.53.d:0 ""Do you have everything?" his mother fussed as they stood at the train station, checking him over and nervously wiping his cheek to remove an imagined smudge. "We packed warm clothes, did we not? What of your shirt? Do you have your best one?" Remy couldn't help but blush a little but bore it silently as the train rolled into the station and they boarded. Finding a seat, Remy sat down as his father helped him to get the bags up on the shelves above them\n\n"Mom, I will be okay," Remy said, giving his mom a hug. In truth, he was scared himself. He had barely even left the town before, and that he'd now move all the way to Vanguardigo to attend school was still a dizzying prospect.\n\n As his parents got off the train, they delayed outside, waving goodbye to him as the train began to slowly move again. Remy couldn't help but notice that his mother seemed to start crying again and swallowed to choke down his own tears.\n\nIt was frightening, but it was also exhilarating. For the first time, this farmboy from rural Orvaillo found he could dream. First the Lycée, then Université, then who knew where? The future was his now, and he wasn't going to waste it!"

I address you this day to speak of loyalty. Many of us hold the notion that loyalty is something that stays in the species and that "outsiders", wherever they come from, cannot be part of this loyal bond."\n\n"I say to you, people of Aquileia, that this has proven itself utterly false not once, but twice in our nation. Our noble pony subjects have twice been among the most fierce and brave protectors of this nation that any monarch could wish for. My father knew their strength and in the recent monhts, so have I come to know it. Where griffons marched in the streets, seeking to overthrow their rightful king, the ponies remained loyal nigh on to the last stallion. I am proud to declare that for these many services, today shall be known the Day of the Faithful, the day where we remember that loyalty and duty is not born in feathers or a beak, but in word and in action, no matter where one comes from.

It seemed Moriset had other ideas though, and lashed out, denouncing all those who would dare to harbour such sentiments as traitors deserving only the guillotine.\n\n His majesty may have scared some griffins straight, but a LOT more are now dismayed by this brutish display."

 aquileia.73.t:0 "The Future Of Vinovia"
 aquileia.73.d:0 "Vinovia finds itself as a crossroad. Our Duke is family to the king and Gadiffer has never been a traitorous griffon. Yet, at the same time many Vinovians harbor revolutionary ideals, from the radical Les Amis des ABC through the Intellectual Student Society to the conservative Chevaliers of Fidelity. What is a Duke to do in times like this? Does one choose family, or their people?"

If we are truly one and the same culture, how come their ways are the right ones, period\n\nIt is time to reject this notion, embrace the food, the language, the customs and the traditions that make up Vinovia and its people."

 aquileia.76.t:0 "Les Amis des ABC"
 aquileia.76.d:0 "A fixture in the cafés and bars of the cities, Les Amis des ABC have long been famous, or infamous depending on how you view it, as radicals and rabble-rousers. Made up primarily of students from less affluent families, they have advocated for breaking down the old social order and even the adoption of socialist ideas, something that's made them either very popular or outright despised depending on which section of society you look at. One thing is for sure though; they are many, they are brave and they are willing to fight."
 aquileia.76.a:0 "To the barricade!"
 
 aquileia.77.t:0 "Les Chevaliers of Fidelity"
 aquileia.77.d:0 "They are something of an anachronism, but no sane person would dismiss Les Chevaliers of Fidelity.\n\nAs an organization of largely upper class griffons and landed gentry who have taken inspiration from the old Vinovian knights errant, they've been central figures within charitable and social work as well as in the preservation of Vinovian culture - in particular martial such. They should have been natural allies of the crown, but their dreams are of Vinovia's pride, not Aquileia's greatness, and for all their oddities, they are more than willing to fight for her."

 aquileia.78.t:0 "Society of Intellectual Students"
 aquileia.78.d:0 "One of the most influential of all movements in Vinovia is the SIS, a nearly century old organization of university students, current and former. They started out as study circles but have over time grown to a massive network of intellectuals and political activists who have seen the changes in other parts of the world - most notably the Kemerskai revolution of 978 - and who are asking themselves why Vinovia does not walk such a path as well. They have influence, contacts and numbers, and they are unrelenting in their pursuit of political change."

 aquileia.79.d:0 "Vinovia is a paradise on earth, yet Aquileia would tell us we're just a sleepy little corner of it, one with odd, primitive customs and who probably should just stick to making wine. Our nobility is as old as Aquileia's but is viewed as country bumpkins, our traditions are considered unbecoming and our language just a primitive dialect. All that we are is inferior to them, and they will only be happy when we leave it all behind."

Its mission shall be to categorize and collect examples of all the things "truly Vinovian".

We have all known it, and after the terrible events all those years ago I know that we all desire peace.\n\nNo one wishes to have their fathers or mothers ripped away in senseless conflict, or their children struck down by the pitiless bullet, or their siblings fallen in the streets where you once played. To those our there who harbor plans to unleash such a terrible thing, I urge you to reconsider. So little can be gained, and so much is at stake.

Even though policeponies blocked their way, the demonstrators forced their way through, scattering the officers and in several cases disarming them by force.\n\nMaybe they had thought the Duke would acquiesce, but instead they were greeted by bullets. The Duke ordered the Ducal guard out to the palace gates and personally demanded the demonstrators scatter. When they refused to obey, he ordered the guard to open fire.\n\nWhen the smoke cleared, almost a hundred lay dead in the streets, with the police, the Ducal Guard and even the military storming the houses and clubs of suspected revolutionaries to bring down the hammer upon anyone seeking to disrupt the peace of Vinovia. It seems the Duke's patience finally ran out."

However, the King called in his Uncle, The (in)famous Denis Discret. Denis had been both an Admiral and a Pirate Lord, who had left his family behind to sail the seas with the navy.\n\nThe Commune had not been prepared for an onslaught the likes that he would bring down upon them, relying on his elite marines as well as Pony Auxillaries he took the city and nearby countryside in a short few weeks.\n\nDespite the heavy losses, the revolution still burns in the monarchist heart of Aquileia. The harder Denis pushes the more it seems the revolutionaries push back. Despite his best efforts over the years he has been unable to end the revolutionary threat, and soon they will march again."

 aquileia.84.t:0 "The Future of our Party"
 aquileia.84.d:0 "The MPA across most of Aquileia is a sad shell of her former glory. Yet under Denis Discret in Pridea it has maintained its character and purpose. The Party are almost all deeply avowed monarchists...almost. We have seen various parties formed on nationalistic ideals from the republican mantras. While they do not fall in line with us perfectly, they are a great weapon against the Communards and their cohorts. With luck they may even be the key to instigate infighting in our opposition."

 aquileia.85.t:0 "The Glory of our Past!"
 aquileia.85.d:0 "Yesterday his highness Baron Dennis Discret organized the grand musical play in local theater, opened to everyone no matter their social standing. On the program was inscenation showcasing important moments from Aquilean history from pen of our very own pridean writer Cherry Pen. Theatergoers were able to witness birth of Kingdom of Aquileia during the first spectacular act. Followed by second act where theatergoers were able to witness valiant stand of Aquilean soldiers against army of Grover I. during his conquest of Griffonia. One was really able to feel their patriotic zeal when defending the land and everyone living in there. In third act theatergoers could see rebellion of proud aquileian patriots led by their king against tyrannical rule of Grover II. which drew many parallels to rebellion of King Gerard Discret in 978 and restoring sovereignty of Aquileia. Casting of the play was excellent and except small technical mishap during the climax of second act this journalist can only praise execution and sheer dedication that went into this play. During the entire play theatergoers could freely enjoy food from banquet tables prepared for the occasion. After the play concluded, all those interested could stay for late night lecture where events showcased in play were fully explained in length."

Upon this hour they strike the cancer within the MPA, the new wing, the radicals of radicals. The Terrible Children we have begot. The death toll will not be high, yet it will also not be without backlash.\n\nWe can only hope that this will make us stronger. Yet as loyal paramilitaries stalk the streets for traitors to the cause and to the king it feels so old and played out. Here we are now eating our own while the Communards sharpen the spikes for our heads."

 aquileia.87.t:0 "La Deuxieme Commune"
 aquileia.87.d:0 "It was dark of the night. Streets of Pridea were empty except occasional night patrols. Yet right now there was single figure hurring across the street. From the outlines one could tell it was a griffon but not much else in this darkness. Figure stopped in front of small house on the outskirts of industrial area of the city. Figure knocked three times. After a while door opened and young male red feathered griffon peered through the crack. He immediately recognized newcomer and smiled. "Pierre, good to see you!" He said friendly and let newcomer-Pierre inside. "I am sorry for being late." Pierre said with apologetic expression. "There were too many policeponies today. I couldn't risk leading them here, Louis." He explained as he removed his cloak, revealing not much older griffon with light orange feathers. "Don't worry we haven't started yet." Louis smiled. Both griffons moved into the next room where rest of the group was already gathered. Room was filled with griffons of all ages and genders. Some old, some young barely beyond being little chicks. They were no army for sure. Some wearing scraps of clothing others being armed with simple outdated revolvers. Yet atmosphere in the room was tense. "You would have us follow FJA? After they run away?!" One of the griffons shouted. "You do not understand. We need to work with them if we are to succeed. Only cooperation can ensure our victory over monarchists." His opponent argued. "NO! FJA is merely Vérany's band of bootlickers. Vérany who run away when things got tough. Abandoned everyone just to save his skin!" Yet another griffon chimed in. "Please be reasonable, comrades. We cannot win without compromise." Griffon continued to argue for alliance with FJA. "They are not so bad. We'll be able to enact our policies and FJA can help us quickly capture hearts of the people and establish truly free democratic nation. You must see that they are right." "Better coward than pony."

Revolution may have failed before, because intervention of treacherous maréchal Berthelot. Vérany and his lackeys fled and abandoned us, left us to suffer under tyranny of another King, but today we stand here with second chance. It is so close that one could grasp it in their claws! Yes, we will prevail!" Crowd noded, some clapped in agreement. "We now know that it is not enough to free just griffons of Aquileia. There are many others suffering under reactionary yoke! We will not stop until everygriff on the continent is free!" He continued. "Free to decide their own life. We don't need any fancy Kings, Princesses or Presidents to tell us what to do. They just desire to oppress us and extend their own will and worldview on us. NO, we can decide our own future working together! Through our dedication and effort will bring paradise to this world!"

"Friends, I think I speak for each and everyone of us here if I say that we must be very careful how we handle this revolution. Everygriff of Aquileia needs to be ready to die for the cause of freedom and our nation because I can guarantee, the forces of bankers, shadowy oligarchs and nobles of the Empire are already scheming in unison with the King and his lackeys how to crush us into the ground.

It wasn't easy to arrange a meeting but they managed to meet up in small town north of Pridea. There were multiple issues to be discussed but main one was support for local revolution in Pridea. It became clear that if revolution in Pridea is to succeed FJA needs to bring all revolutionary elements within the city on board. Preparations for meeting between FJA party representative and Pridean communards were under way. Meeting had to be rescheduled and moved to different location several times to different location, for fear of being discovered by police authorities. It needs no mention that might spell disaster for the revolution as a whole. At last one night members of all sides met in a forest within territory of Duchy of Vinovia. Meeting was certainly heated but in the end all members agreed to work together and put their mutual differences to rest until revolution is over."

Among their demands was equal representation of ponies and griffons at work. Protest didn't disperse even after arrival of police. In the end our brave policeponies had to use the force to break up the demonstration and chase protestors away.

However some might call what happened next treachery. Swift trials happened and everyone arrested was executed to death. They were shot swiftly afterwards.

Captains of the affected ships decided to go on the sea to make their subordinates see reason and bring them in line. However what they saw upon their arrival shocked them. One of the captain mentioned later. "They were just relaxing. We saw some of them fishing on the broadsides. Others were playing hoofball on ramp for planes, while rest was talking and drinking."

The governing MPA found out too late which was good, but they turned out too be the least of her issues. As now that the shock of the secret meeting had passed, her rag-tag group fought more openly. It took all of her will and oration to bring them together to agree on any amount of points. Points that just happen to be exactly against the MPA.\n\nBut now she must make a choice.

The day seemed calm. All rainy days did. After all, even the angriest mob hates getting wet. But he knew it wouldn’t last. Tomorrow, the crowds would sing revolutionary songs, write slogans on the walls and spit behind nobles and guards. And his advisors would come back to the palace to badger him about beating them back into obedience.\n\nHe was tired. His conscience was weighing increasingly heavy on his shoulders. The truth was plain and simple and yet it pained him to discover himself so foolish. He had always been at odds with his family. The Discret dynasty had always been so... Backward looking. they had no ideas as to what the world should become. They only saw tradition and Aquileia as their personal property. There was no place for popular consent, greater ideals of statecraft or even a conception of life being more than obedient labour. Those ideas, any understanding of the great truths of the world really, were held not by them but by the likes of Kemerskai or Vérany. Michel always saw the republic as an experiment that had been worth trying, even if it cost to his family.  His birth didn’t leave him much choice in life but it gave him some power. His power had been the sword of ducal power. Yet, he tried to subvert it, transforming it into a tool to carve something new. If he had bore any other name than Discret, he would have been executed for treason already but the family let him indulge in hosting philosophers and artists if the bastilles would operate and if Rila was stable. Not enough, he thought. And he indulged more, helping the republicans to bring about\n\nAnd what now? The bastilles were ashes and Rila was clamoring for revolution. All because he followed his ideals, blind to the fact that his friends, those reasonable partisans of compromise, reform and freedom in either a monarchy or a peacefully installed republic, were drowned in the cries of blood. All because of these "enragés", the rabid members of this Cocardiers club. It was them who resonated with the people, who spoke to their lower instincts. They were everywhere in Rila now, robbing, pressuring, killing and worse. And they wouldn’t stop until all of the Discret family lay dead in a pit.\n\nYet maybe cooler heads would prevail in the end. Maybe the beast of old had to be put down before a fledgling freedom could emerge. Maybe his conscience had been right after all. Maybe."

The place of gathering was the mansion of count De Becignier, one of the rare noblegriffs sympathetic to the revolution. While some in attendance sneered at the mention of his name, he had been integral in guaranteeing safety and secrecy for the event.\n\nThe Committee was the first rilan attempt in years to federate the various republican organisations known in Rila as the revolutionary clubs. Of those there were many and of all stripes. Some, like the Société Justice or the Club de la Raison were more than willing to meet the monarchist halfway if it meant the perennity of the new institutions. Others were simply united in their conclusions of the failure of the monarchy and a need to end, some even socialist in nature. Others like the Club des Haies, the Fanal or the Club Patriote had more precise ideas as to what the future Republic would have to look like to be safe. However, the most important group of all was the Cocardiers, a group of radicals, single minded in ensuring that the second Republic would not be crushed, whatever the cost. And if the Republic was to not be crush, the monarchy would have to be. Brutally and utterly.\n\nReaching a compromise to make such a loose coalition had been a hurdle but it had been accomplished. They were there, two hundreds and twenty six representatives in attendance to plan and execute a revolution."

However, the consensus was that it was still to early and that the information could be used for propaganda purposes. In the end, the propagandists prevailed and the Cocardiers’ plan was voted down, not without some name calling.\n\nThe representatives of the Club du Verbe Vrai were tasked to use their network within Rila’s print shops and bookstores to stockpile republican propaganda in the forms of posters, banners and notices. The Fanal was then tasked with using their followers, mostly illiterate workers, to insert the material in the streets.\n\nUnbeknownst to most of the Committee, the "informations" were in fact provided by Duke Michel himself. Members of the more reform-minded faction reached a deal with him to spread the word of republicanism in the capital. The security forces had in fact been given orders to clear the streets and stand down, effectively turning a blind eye to the whole operation."

The restored regime wished to maintain prisoners away from the historical center of the revolution. It didn’t say idle either over the years since the end of the revolution, sending continuously more griffs to Rila. These prisoners were gathered in a few fortresses that would serve as fortified prison : the bastilles. As time went on, they become the living symbol of the royal oppression in Rila, standing high as a perpetual reminder of where lovers of liberty would go to die in darkness if caught.\n\nThe Committee, united in this at least, sought to put an end to theses prisons. They planned a mass-scale attack on all bastilles with the following objectives : starting fires and fights at various points in town to distract the troops, gather mobs of sympathizers, overwhelm the defenses, free the prisoners and loot as many guns as possible.\n\nOn [Root.GetDateText], the plan was executed. Mobs of republicans assembled and led by club members marched on the fortresses. In some places, they found sympathetic or cowardly guards who simply refused to engage them, opening the gates in exchange for their safety. Everywhere else, fighting followed and it was bloody and bruised that the republicans freed their comrades and common prisoners alike. That day, the Republicans grew in number by the hundreds and many tears of joy were shed as long lost friends and parents met again. Sadly, in the Flowerino bastille, the mob assembled by the local Cocardiers suffered greatly at the claws of the guards and butchered everygriff inside in a frenzied revenge.\n\nThe news alarmed the authorities who scrambled to crack down on the clubs but information was lacking. The ducal palace was panicking. Yet, one griff still stayed calm : duke Michel himself. Some of his advisors saw it as a sign of his resolve in the face of danger. Sadly, for them, it was not because of a strength of character but because he knew beforehand. After all, six fortresses don’t fall in a single day to angry mobs because of sheer revolutionary fervor..."

However, what the republicans have in strength of character, they lack in weaponry. And while one can argue that Aquileian republicanism is bulletproof, revolutionary bodies are not. The cause requires guns.\n\nThe committee explored many plans to gather weapons from the local arsenals or gunrunners but it ultimately failed. The arsenals in Rila were too well-guarded or too loyal to the regime.\n\nArmed with this, members of various clubs packed up and crossed the borders to Aquileia, linking with the republican lodges there. They consented to help of course but still it wasn’t enough to consider their mission even remotely successful. So, gnashing their beaks, the republicans indebted themselves to a variety of unsavory ponies and griffs from all over. Large sums were paid in exchange for jamming guns, poorly assembled contraband guns produced by socialists or some that were state of the art indeed should you have had them during the first revolution.\n\nThe Cocardiers smuggled it all back to Rila with difficulty. Some crates were lost in the border crossing after rilan border patrol griffs spotted one of their groups but all revolutionaries managed to finally come back to the republican compound in Dilven. There, despite their pained looks of disappointment, they were greeted with cheers by their comrades now in arms. The cause finally had claws."

As such, he posited, any griff of wealth whose loyalty to the republican cause is not beyond doubt should be made a target and robbed of their wealth to fund the revolution. While the proposal was at first met with grumbles or shuckles from the moderates and reformists ranks, it resonated among many club representative from the lower classes and some socialists. They scolded the moderates and reformists for their unwillingness to follow through on the revolutionary ideal. After the attack was made against their rivals, the Cocardiers loudly heckled them and rallied around the proposal. Some moderates wavered while others tried to defend their reputation. Some left the meeting in protestation. In the end, the proposal was adopted.\n\nThe debate had some immediate consequences as members of various clubs decided to join the Cocardier cause, reinforcing their lead in the Committee further.\n\nIn the following weeks, members of the Cocardiers would begin organising raids on the so-called "rupins", wealthy nobles of Rila, and recruiting the populace to join in the looting."

He sighed sadly, knowing that it was a piece of Aquileia’s soul and spirit that was burning down there.\n\nIn the streets of Rila and in other cities, order had been given. All bookshops, printers and private libraries were to be raided. Any books deemed subversive to the established order of Aquileia and its vassals were to be gathered and burned in front for all to see.\n\nThe decision had been a tough one. His advisors had united against the duke who had committed himself to protect a certain degree of freedom of thought and writing among philosophers in Rila. He fought back but it was clear that if he didn’t comply, the fabric of his administration would begin to unravel at a time when he couldn’t afford to.

For years, the ducal advisors tried to sugarcoat it at court in Rila or Aquila but to put it plainly : the treasury is nearly empty. At this moment, credit is unavailable and the duchy needs funds to handle the instability.\n\nFortunately, the ducal administration has designed a policy based on an area where the ducal authorities has remained absolutely unchallenged : the organisation of fairs and marketplaces. Traditionally, it has been used to favor trade and the organization of fairs in all of Rila. It has historically made marketplaces and fairs much more popular in the ducal policies. The plan is to harness this popularity by enacting a decree banning trade outside of fairs and markets organized by the duchy and imposing a fee on all participating vendors. This would also placate the trading nobility and the merchants who heavily lobbied for interventions against new competition.\n\nThe decisions hasn’t gone down without immediate reactions. The coterie of liberal thinkers hosted by the duke is rather miffed, to put it mildly. Smaller merchants have also already began petitioning to lower the fee or repeal the decree. Duke Michel himself seemed sympathetic to these pleas and already agreed to grant some exceptions to various small farmers and artisans who regularly took parts to the markets."

Duke Michel will oversee it all himself as a grand marshall and will attend the festivities. One could even catch the eye of Rila’s most prized bachelor at the ball.\n\nNow, one would be hard-pressed to find a griff who could tell you the story of Weeping Renée in Rila. One who could is a griff with a burning passion for Aquileian folklore at duke Michel’s court. She was apparently a most devout griff who threw herself before emperor Grover II as he prepared himself to burn down Rila. While a fine story and a proof that history lessons may be needed, it mostly mattered as a justification for the grand festivities. And while the good people watches our duke dancing, a whole other kind of dance will happen all over the capital.\n\nThe ducal administration knew of many warehouses in the capital which could be potential safehouses or arsenals for the revolutionaries. The duke himself produced a list of specific warehouses owned by members of the Cocarcier revolutionary club. Asked by an advisor of how he discovered it, the duke simply chuckled : "Why Weeping Renée of course ! It is only normal she would come back to prevent other griffs from setting the duchy ablaze."

Artists are entertaining the masses and activities have been organized for the fledglings.\n\nWith only minimal security, duke Michel has braved the danger and mingles among the crowd.

As griffs of all ages entertains themselves in a family-friendly manner, the ducal army has moved in the countryside. One by one, farmhouses are being raided for any traces of revolutionary hiding places or sympathizers.\n\nAs expected too, the presence of the duke attracted opportunistic revolutionaries, namely a local group of Cocardier terrorists. The fools tried to make a move on the duke. Sadly for them, the duke’s entourage had been tipped off and as soon as they tried to attack him, soldiers in civilian clothing jumped on them. Surprisingly enough, peasants joined the fight on the side of the duke, thinking the duke was indeed at risk.

With extraordinary speed, a grand Défilé was organized on the seaside streets in a celebration of Pélis, a true pearl of the duchy.\n\nYet, the elites of Rila had little interest in Pélisian naval tradition. However, they had been keeping tabs on the revolutionary activities in Pélis which was a well-known bastion of republicanism in the duchy. Revolutionary clubs like the Fanal or the Cocardiers had ample support among the dockworkers and shipyard workers. Local forces had gathered a lot of information but never used them, for fear that action could cause an uprising. The revolutionaries knew it and exploited it.\n\nThe Défilé allowed to finally break the revolutionaries surveillance. Ducal agents assembled in Pélis, disguised as civilians attending the Défilé. They came by cars, carriages, train, ships and even by foot. With their support and with the distraction from the Défilé, the local authorities finally launched a large scale raid.

 JER_deal_with_republican_MPA:0 "Traitors Within the MPA"
 JER_deal_with_republican_MPA_desc:0 "They claim to be the loyal servants of the nation, but some among the Mouvement Patriote d'Aquileia seem to have forgotten that Aquileia is and has always been His Majesty. It is time to see to it that the MPA are cleansed of this rot."
 JER_visit_vinovia:0 "State Visit to Vinovia"
 JER_visit_vinovia_desc:0 "Duke Gadiffer is many things, but above all else he is a festive and pleasant griffon. Princess Vivienne has convinced her father to be allowed to undertake a mission to go visit the Duke and help show the royal faith in his reign. Somewhat reluctantly, His Majesty has agreed."
 JER_help_pridea:0 "Everyone's Favourite Uncle"
 JER_help_pridea_desc:0 "Baron Dennis, the uncle of the King, is one of His Majesty's most capable - and ruthless - loyalists. We are thankful for this, as it means that in order to quash the nascent rebellion in Pridea we only need to trust in Uncle Dennis."
 JER_give_dennis_free_reign:0 "Give Dennis Free Reign"
 JER_give_dennis_free_reign_desc:0 "As His Majesty hoped, his uncle has responded frankly and clearly. All he requires to burn out this rot - likely literally knowing the good Baron - is His Majesty's approval. His Majesty sees no reason to not give it."
 JER_mass_crackdowns:0 "Find the Revolutionaries"
 JER_mass_crackdowns_desc:0 "During the last revolution, Baron Dennis Discret did not hesitate to bring the wrath of Arcturius upon the traitors, and time has not dulled his claws one bit. Pridea runs red with blood as His Majesty's uncle is acting with commendable zeal to crush any signs of republicanism."
 JER_send_monarchist_MPA:0 "Reinforce the MPA"
 JER_send_monarchist_MPA_desc:0 "The Pridean wing of the MPA is a singularly committed force. The Baron has kept them on a tight leash and made sure they're marching to the royal drumbeat from early on, and if they are given the backing needed, Pridea will more or less handle itself for us."
 JER_to_kill_an_idea:0 "To Kill An Idea"
 JER_to_kill_an_idea_desc:0 "It is over.\n\nBlood soaks the streets and the fields of the kingdom, but it is a kingdom that stands battered but unbowed. The republicans did not triumph this time either, and this time we will make sure there will not be a next time for these traitorous scum."
 JER_begin_reforming_education_system:0 "Teach the People"
 JER_begin_reforming_education_system_desc:0 "It seems that we have been lax in our duties to educate the populace. If so many of them had not been illiterate and ignorant, the weeds of republicanism would not have taken root so swiftly. It is time to educate them so that they better can understand their duties and their privileges as servants of the crown."
 JER_royal_academy:0 "Académie Royale Des Sciences"
 JER_royal_academy_desc:0 "Aquileia is ancient and glorious, but past glories make a poor substitute for progress. Therefore, we have signed charter for a grand new Academy of Science. Its mission: becoming the world's foremost institute within its fields."
 JER_integrate_the_loyal:0 "Integrate the Loyalists"
 JER_integrate_the_loyal_desc:0 "Our subjects have served us well, and we will always remember those who in this dark hour stood by the crown. All the same though, the time has come for us to centralize control of the nation."
 JER_integrate_the_MPA:0 "Reward the Patriots"
 JER_integrate_the_MPA_desc:0 "During the revolution, the measure of Aquileia's patriots was shown. Too many had forgotten the crown, but those who still remembered fought like heroes in the nation's defense. It is only right and proper that we reward the good memory of the MPA."
 JER_reward_the_ponies:0 "Reward the Ponies"
 JER_reward_the_ponies_desc:0 "Time and time again, our little ponies have proven themselves as dependable and as loyal as any king could hope for. Ponies such as Seva Shako, whose volunteers held back an entire division of rebels, are an example and an inspiration to all of us, and they should be rewarded as such."  
 JER_initial_army_reforms:0 "The Beginnings Of An Army"
 JER_initial_army_reforms_desc:0 "Our soldiers served well during the rebellion and it is therefore a disgrace that their training, equipment and even leadership can differ so. It is time for us to create one unified army that will be the pride of the nation."
 JER_new_officers:0 "Fresh Talent"
 JER_new_officers_desc:0 "If our army is to be the best we must start at the top; an army of heroes led by fools will go nowhere. Already, we have noted several promising cadets that will become the new generation of generals for a new generation of soldiers."
 JER_support_domestic_industries:0 "Support Aquileian Entrepreneurs"
 JER_support_domestic_industries_desc:0 "In order for Aquileia to prosper, we must place a modicum of faith in the common griffon, and to this end we have decided to invest in some select subjects of the crown so that they may grow into their full potential."
 JER_build_the_nation:0 "A Shining Beacon"
 JER_build_the_nation_desc:0 "Our kingdom is ancient and glorious in equal measure, a shining beacon of prosperity and progress that has and lit the way of uncountable generations and which shall continue to do so in the future as well."
 JER_new_law_code:0 "The Discret Code"
 JER_new_law_code_desc:0 "Our legal system has fallen behind the times, being a confusing and contradictory mess of old laws, privileges and local precedents that make the courts' duties nigh impossible to carry out. It is time to create a new, uniform and modern system of law that will ease the burden for both courts and citizens."
 JER_a_advisory_parliament:0 "Parlement Royal"
 JER_a_advisory_parliament_desc:0 "Our monarch is the state, and so it shall remain, but it has nevertheless been suggested that maybe a form of parliament should be formed. It could assist the crown in carrying out its duties and deal with the issues that are beneath the royal dignity, so that the commoners may feel included and not succumb to republicanism again."
 JER_old_glories:0 "Past Glories"
 JER_old_glories_desc:0 "Aquileia is not some subject nation who meekly will bow her head. She knows no equal and will accept no position but at the top of the world where she belongs! She is a a queen among nations, a roaring lion!"
 JER_reclaim_northwest:0 "Reclaim The North"
 JER_reclaim_northwest_desc:0 "With the heart of Aquileia finally secure, it is time to look north. Our old lands have been left in a pitiable state, with everything from peasant republics to merchant states trying to assert their own control in the region. These errant breakaway regions must be brought back into the fold swiftly and firmly."
 JER_reclaim_east:0 "Reclaim The East"
 JER_reclaim_east_desc:0 "To the east lie lands which have not been part of Aquileia for a longer time. The area currently held by the Houses of Avian and Erie were once part of our Kingdom before Grover I seized them and granted them as a reward to their loyal Verenian hounds. Tarrin on the other claw was lost relatively recently, but is also rightfully ours! It is now time we retake these lands."
 JER_reintegrate_old_lands:0 "Reintegrate the Old Lands"
 JER_reintegrate_old_lands_desc:0 "What pitiful state our old lands have been reduced to! We must start reintegrating them into the kingdom proper immediately and see to it that they are restored to their old glories as part of a greater whole."
 JER_pony_mage_regiments:0 "Régiments de Mage"
 JER_pony_mage_regiments_desc:0 "For centuries our little ponies have been the most faithful of subjects and their magic is truly something to behold. It is a disservice to these faithful equines that we have not made better use of their skills until now. From this day onwards the Régiments de Mage shall give our pony subjects the ability to truly serve to the best of their abilities."
 JER_the_grand_army:0 "Grande Armée"
 JER_the_grand_army_desc:0 "Aquileia's army is meant for more than just being an other army. It is to be an unparalelled beast, one built from thousands upon thousands of soldiers unequalled in ferocity and courage and ready to die for their fatherland if their duty so demands."
 JER_pardon_republican_officers:0 "A Royal Pardon"
 JER_pardon_republican_officers_desc:0 "There are degrees of everything, even treason. Several republican officers have, from their cells, pleaded for a chance to redeem themselves. Some would call it an insult to justice, but Aquileia is not a nation wont to squander its subjects' talents."
 JER_expand_conscription:0 "Levée En Masse"
 JER_expand_conscription_desc:0 "How sweet and honourable it is to die for one's country. Aquileia's people know this truth well, and if needed they will leap, eagerly and bravely, into action for the crown and for the fatherland."
 JER_final_showdown:0 "The Final Showdown"
 JER_final_showdown_desc:0 "The time has come to contest the Griffonian Empire. For too long, they have thought themselves the true masters of Griffonia while we were forced to bow our heads before them. No longer though, it is time for Aquileia to spread her wings and take her place as the queen of griffonkind. Forwards! La Victoire est a nous!"
 
 JER_fight_for_freedom:0 "Fight For Your Freedom!"
 JER_fight_for_freedom_desc:0 "We the people of Aquileia must rise up in defence of our republican ideals! We cannot let a Monarchic tyrant dictate our freedoms and our way of life! we must defend our beliefs, if unto death if we must!"
 JER_officer_allies:0 "Allies Within the King's Guard"
 JER_officer_allies_desc:0 "We must contact our allies within the King's guard itself to solidify their support for our cause, just as it is. Truly, if even the King's Guard is on our side, what must that say about our position?"
 JER_secret_meetings:0 "Spread the Word"
 JER_secret_meetings_desc:0 "It's time to spread the word of our goals by a broad propaganda. As such, we must spread the word of our movement far  and wide, to as many ears as will listen, be they griffon or otherwise."
 JER_fight_for_liberty:0 "Ideas Never Die"
 JER_fight_for_liberty_desc:0 "People may die, but ideas never do! It is time we stand up for ideas in the open, regardless of the consequences. We must bring about change ourselves, for better or for worse!"
 JER_donat:0 "Donations From Old Friends"
 JER_donat_desc:0 "We should go about gathering 'donations' from old friends of ours- donations of coin are, of course, always welcome, but so are donations in regards to Griffonpower and construction efforts. Regardless, we should be in a position to accept any and all aid sent to help our great endeavour."
 JER_secret_government:0 "Form the Provisional Government"
 JER_secret_government_desc:0 "We should form our own form of government in preparation for when we retake the throne of Aquileia. However, we must parley with the Socialists to make sure they stay on board- a fact that we should not take lightly."
 JER_return_of_the_generals:0 "Return of the Republicans"
 JER_return_of_the_generals_desc:0 "The time has come for several key Republican-supporting officers to return to command, in preparation for our upcoming return to democracy. With them making sure the Army is unable to fully intervene, we shall be able to continue forward with our plans."
 JER_revolution:0 "The Second Revolution"
 JER_revolution_desc:0 "We've been here before. This time, however, will be different: This time, we shall leave no Monarchist Shills alive to reclaim the Monarchist's throne. If we must return Aquileia to Democracy by force, then by force shall we return to Democracy!"
 JER_kill_king:0 "Off With His Head!"
 JER_kill_king_desc:0 "Down with tyrants! Down with the King! We shall bring him to his favoured Guillotine, and with that guillotine, secure our victory! No longer shall a Monarch rule our lives. We are our own griffons, and no one shall tell us different."
 JER_back_into_fold:0 "End the Autonomous Regions"
 JER_back_into_fold_desc:0 "With an end to the Kingdom and its monarchist rule, we must bring an end to the autonomy once afforded to the nearby regions. They must return to the fold, if by force if necessary, as our new democratic state has no use for Monarchist supporters."
 JER_constitution:0 "A New Constitution"
 JER_constitution_desc:0 "With our victory secure, we must write a new constitution, for all griffons under our new rule. One that will ensure their future security and place in the sun, never to be taken away by any tyrant, internal or external. "
 JER_election:0 "Hold Elections"
 JER_election_desc:0 "It is time, now that we've gone through the steps to draft our new constitution, to hold elections.

 JER_election_radicals:0 "A Victory for the Radicals"
 JER_election_radicals_desc:0 "Clearly the people have spoken, and the people want to become a socialist state- now! It is time to institute our reforms as quickly as possible, for a better state. We will take charge in all matters of state, from the top down, and the bottom up."
 JER_anti_clericalism:0 "Anti-Clericalism"
 JER_anti_clericalism_desc:0 "No gods, no masters. We are our own people, not to be weighted down with the dalliances of ancient and outdated religions. It is time for the new griffon to come into it's own, not weighed down by mythology and old fashioned, backwards, and frankly idiotic thinking. A griffon chooses- A slave obeys fake gods."
 JER_assassinate_moderates:0 "Tie Any Loose Ends"
 JER_assassinate_moderates_desc:0 "With our victory secure, we can now take steps to secure our political position for the foreseeable future. We must take the initiative to remove our political enemies from the field of play- by any and all means necessary."
 JER_commissars:0 "CSE Commissar Divisions"
 JER_commissars_desc:0 "While our Comité is making great strides and has done excellent work for while it's been in existence, we can expand upon them and improve their day to day effectiveness by developing dedicated Commissariat divisions, both to expand their reach and increase their in-field usefulness."
 JER_hunt_democrats:0 "Hunt Down the FJA"
 JER_hunt_democrats_desc:0 "We can now take strides to erase the right wing bureaucrats from office completely. We must do so quickly, without mercy and without falter, so that our victory can be fully secure, with both the moderate sellouts and the Bourgeoisie Capitalists dead and gone from memory. Only then can we truly call ourselves the true government of Aquileia."
 JER_rapid_industralisation:0 "Rapid Industrial Development"
 JER_rapid_industralisation_desc:0 "The quickest way to garner public support is to fix our decaying industrial sector, and greatly improve it. We'll build new factories as quickly as possible, both improving our capabilities, and making us more popular in the populace's eyes."
 JER_commie_army:0 "Form the Aquileian Revolutionary Army"
 JER_commie_army_desc:0 "Our old army was pathetic at best, and useless at worst. If we are to secure our government for good and keep ourselves and our people safe, we must form a new army- and quickly."
 JER_communists:0 "The Dictatorship of the Proletariat"
 JER_communists_desc:0 "Our country is making great strides- and we shall continue these strides. Of the people, for the people, shall be our motto and our means to an end. We shall make ourselves the model of a Socialist state, to be looked at with respect and reverence. We, above all else, shall be a true worker's paradise, free from the shackles of Capitalist societies and their outdatedness."
 JER_education_soc:0 "Education Reforms"
 JER_education_soc_desc:0 "If we are to begin converting our populace to the wonders of Socialism, we must first begin educating the masses, so as to help them understand why our Socialist state is superior to the Monarchy of old, and to bring up smarter, more well-informed griffons."
 JER_education_soc_finish:0 "A Communist Education"
 JER_education_soc_finish_desc:0 "We must finish our education reforms as quickly as possible, to help to bring forth the new Socialist griffon. While we have already made good strides in educating the illiterate masses, we must finish the re-education campaign, pulling ourselves up kicking and screaming by our bootstraps if we must."
 JER_griffonian_revolution:0 "A New Revolution"
 JER_griffonian_revolution_desc:0 "Our own revolution is complete, however, across Griffonia, the people still find themselves oppressed under the heels of Monarchists and dictators. Our revolution has ended, but the revolution to free the continent of Griffonia is only just beginning."
 JER_integrate_FEZ:0 "Integrate the Old Lands"
 JER_integrate_FEZ_desc:0 "Now that we have a few moments to rest upon our laurels, we must fully integrate all the old Aquileian states into our new Socialist State."
 JER_final_battle:0 "A Flame the Ages Shall Not Extinguish"
 JER_final_battle_desc:0 "It is time to strike against the most glaring voice of dissent against our way of life; the most vile of states, the old Griffonian Empire. A pathetic shrivelled shadow of what it once was, the Empire needs to be fully crushed again, never to return."
 JER_KGB:0 "Comité pour la sécurité de l'État"
 JER_KGB_desc:0 "With Aquileia firmly under our grasp we must now make sure that reactionaries both at home and abroad never again have a chance to threaten our beloved Republic. To ensure the safety of the public and the state a new intelligence agency shall be created for this exact purpose."
 
 JER_election_moderates:0 "A Victory for the Moderates"
 JER_election_moderates_desc:0 "In a fair democratic election, we have won a great victory for socialism. However, our work cannot stop there. We still have much to do, and little time with which to do it."
 JER_election_moderates:0 "Resource Nationalisation"
 JER_election_moderates_desc:0 "One of our first steps toward a proper and free socialist state is to nationalise the resources away from the monopolistic companies of the old regime. Whilst we should still promote businesses by value of keeping a limited and controlled market, we should still give out incentives to boost productivity and keep people interested in investing into our resource networks."
 JER_national_industry:0 "Limited Nationalisation"
 JER_national_industry_desc:0 "Building upon our earlier incentives towards limited markets, we should, in some capacity, nationalise our industrial sector. While there will be some privatisation still, as that is conducive to keeping investors interested and therefore keeping our technology up to date, we should place ideal restrictions upon some industries to prevent Capitalistic or Monopolistic tendencies from running rampant."
 JER_reconcile_with_archon:0 "Reconcile With the Clergy"
 JER_reconcile_with_archon_desc:0 "While the new Socialist griffon does not have a need for the old ways of religion, we should not go out of our way to antagonise the clergy, considering that they still have a wide base of support amongst all parties in our new republic. Ergo, we should make amends, so as to keep civil discourse between our two groups, and to appease the people. In the end, it is up to them, after all, to decide whether the old ways will survive or die."
 JER_education:0 "Free Education"
 JER_education_desc:0 "Before the introduction of the Republic, Education was only for the wealthy and Bourgeoisie noble classes. If we are to continue forward with our Republic, we must address this issue, and quickly."
 JER_bernie_sanders:0 "Free Healthcare"
 JER_bernie_sanders_desc:0 "One of our first steps towards a free and proper, modern socialist state should be to provide the masses with free health care. In doing this, we ensure every griffon's future at a low expense, and we will be able to also garner a wider base of support, as people will feel thankful for the free aid."
 JER_militia_army:0 "An Army of Militias"
 JER_militia_army_desc:0 "While not the most orthodox or centralised military, our new militia model army will be one to be respected. Our goal is to raise several local militias, each with their own fairly elected officer corps, which will serve as reservists, keeping their day jobs until it is required to take up arms to defend our way of life."
 JER_the_republic:0 "Reclaim the Old Borders"
 JER_the_republic_desc:0 "We must bring our new, free, Socialist way of life to our old border states, both to liberate their working force from the tyrannical heel of Monarchism, and to reclaim our ancestral homes from said tyrants."
 JER_education_finish_moderates:0 "Educate the Masses"
 JER_education_finish_moderates_desc:0 "While our education reforms have proven quite successful, we must finish our reforms, to bring our people fully into the modern waking world."
 JER_aquileian_revolution:0 "The Home of the Free"
 JER_aquileian_revolution_desc:0 "With our people finally reunited under one banner, we must now look to securing our state against any and all outside aggression. We must also quickly reintegrate our old lands into our new state. Therefore, new centres of government and new border defences must be established, for our allies are few, and our enemies are many."
 JER_partisans_effort:0 "No Surrender"
 JER_partisans_effort_desc:0 "There shall be not one step backwards! We must defend our lands to the end, whether in victory or in defeat, but we shall be forever remembered as the staunchest of defenders, unwilling to give up a single scrap of open ground to our enemies. Each inch shall be fought over as if it were a mile, and each mile, as if it were a city."
 JER_infrasctructure_project:0 "Railroad Projects"
 JER_infrasctructure_project_desc:0 "The steam powered locomotive is truly the way forward into the modern era. As such, we should invest in this method of transportation, to truly prove to the world how far we have come, and how far we can, in the future, go."
 JER_industry_buildup:0 "Industrial Buildup"
 JER_industry_buildup_desc:0 "With our new state-backed railroad networks in place, we should also see about hooking them up to our industrial base. Ergo, we must build up new infrastructure and industry to benefit this, and to set a precedent for future industrial endeavours."
 JER_industry_projects:0 "State Armouries"
 JER_industry_projects_desc:0 "In addition to industrial and infrastructure reforms and advances, we should also take some time to set up some state-backed armouries for a few local militias. This should ease the burdens on our armaments organisers, and help to better equip our militias for any current or future conflicts they must partake in."
 JER_resource_nationalisation:0 "Resource Nationalisation"
 JER_resource_nationalisation_desc:0 "The first of many steps for our newly established administration, the state will commit the seizure of deposits of valuable metals. The state will promise that these metals will be wisely used to ensure the protection of our citizens."
 
 JER_election_democracy:0 "A Victory for Freedom"
 JER_election_democracy_desc:0 "We have won a fair and just democratic victory! Despite worries about our socialist brethren that aided us in our struggles, Democracy has prevailed. It is now time to focus on our new country; our new Republic."
 JER_government_unity:0 "Form a Coalition Government"
 JER_government_unity_desc:0 "While our Socialist brothers were defeated in a fair democratic election, we cannot alienate and isolate them from government. Instead, we must offer them the olive branch of peace, and form a joint FJA-PAT coalition as our governmental institution. This will not only garner us a wide support base, but will also help to soothe tensions between us and the PAT."
 JER_federation:0 "The Aquileian Federated Republic"
 JER_federation_desc:0 "Now that we have secured our internal standing, we must look outwards to the Republic's former border states. Now, we must decide how we are going to deal with said states, which are tellingly still shackled by their tyrannical monarchs and feudalistic rulers."
 JER_federal_reserve:0 "Form the Federal Reserve"
 JER_federal_reserve_desc:0 "We need to form a backable and sustainable reserve of funds for public works projects, that we can draw upon for future works, such as industrial reforms or infrastructural projects. Forming a national bank and national reserve would be an excellent first step for this."
 JER_outer_states:0 "The Outer Republics"
 JER_outer_states_desc:0 "It is time to reintegrate our border states into proper Republican states within our Federated Republic. To do this, however, will take a fight of it's own, as there is little doubt the Monarchists will fight tooth and nail to keep their power to themselves, and out of the talons of their people."
 JER_entente:0 "Allies on the Homefront"
 JER_entente_desc:0 "We should look for allies wherever we are capable of garnering them, whether here or abroad. Alone we shall fall, or together we shall overcome."
 JER_invite_TRD:0 "Invite the Skyfall Federation"
 JER_invite_TRD_desc:0 "We should invite the Skyfall Trade Federation to our Entente, to secure their free trade routes and to garner an ally with ready access to the sea, and the world abroad."
 JER_invite_FAT:0 "Invite the Northern Republicans"
 JER_invite_FAT_desc:0 "We should invite the Far Northern Republicans within the Griffon Republic to our Entente, in preparations for any aggression from the decaying Empire. We must support our fellow Republicans, wherever and whenever possible."
 JER_war_against_empire:0 "Once More Unto the Breach"
 JER_war_against_empire_desc:0 "The Time has come to defeat Monarchism and it's Feudal grip on free griffons everywhere. Once more unto the breach must we march, for Liberty, Equality, and Peace forevermore in Griffonia!"
 JER_reclaim_riverlands:0 "Reclaim the Outer Republics"
 JER_reclaim_riverlands_desc:0 "It is time to topple the Monarchs within the old Border states, and liberate our Brethren, to truly make Aquileia free for all griffons, regardless of upbringing or background."
 JER_final_preperations:0 "The Final Preparations"
 JER_final_preperations_desc:0 "The time is nearly here to end feudalistic tyranny upon our home continent of Griffonia, by striking at the black heart of the Empire to our North. Before we can do that, however, we must make our final preparations to bring ourselves to a full war footing with the coming foe. If we are unready, then we shall surely lose. Nothing can be left to chance."
 JER_education_fixing:0 "Every Griffon an Education"
 JER_education_fixing_desc:0 "Every griffon, be they Nobility or the common griffon, deserves the right to a fair and full education. As we are now in a position to promote this, we must make good on our political promises and do so, so that we may bring ourselves into a new age of enlightenment."
 JER_industry_construction:0 "Industrial Projects"
 JER_industry_construction_desc:0 "Aside from our Education reforms, we should also take strides to improve our outdated industrial sector, so that we can continue to compete with the rest of the Continent."
 JER_education_finalised:0 "An Educated Nation"
 JER_education_finalised_desc:0 "Our education reforms have come far, but there is still more to do. We still have much work ahead of us if we are to truly call ourselves an Educated and Enlightened Nation."
 JER_guard_republica:0 "Form the Republican Guard"
 JER_guard_republica_desc:0 "We must develop a standardised and professional military, to defend our borders and our way of life from any exterior threats: not an army of hatred and tyranny, as in the olden days, but one of defence, and justice."
 JER_the_plot:0 "Take Care of the Radicals"
 JER_the_plot_desc:0 "Regardless of our Socialist allies' pledges of allegiance, there are clearly some elements of the far left that refuse to fall in line with our ideals, despite our victory over them in the election. We must decide what our plans are to be in regards to dealing with these types, before something terrible happens."
  
 JER_commie_industry:0 "A Planned Economy"
 JER_commie_industry_desc:0 "An unpredictable and unfair market economy benefits the rich and harms the poor. It is clear our government must assume direct control of production, distribution and prices to ensure wealth is spread evenly among all. Though perhaps the leaders of the party shall receive a little more as a reward for their work."
 JER_new_workers:0 "The New Aquileian Worker"
 JER_new_workers_desc:0 "The new worker has no master, no employer he unwillingly serves in order to survive. The employees shall work for not only themselves but for the nation as a whole, loyally serving the state, producing for use instead of profit and sharing the fruits of their labour with their comrades."
 JER_nationalisation_of_factories:0 "Factories For the Working Griffon"
 JER_nationalisation_of_factories_desc:0 "The means of production belong to those that use them! We must seize factories from greedy private companies for ourselves. We, the state, represent the people, and thus the people shall own the factories. Nationalization is vital for the eventual transition into stateless communism. Trust us."
 JER_industrial_commitee:0 "Form the Comité Industrielle d'Aquileia"
 JER_industrial_commitee_desc:0 "A central committee composed of members of the party shall be formed to direct the economy and draft long-term plans for development and modernization. The committee knows what is best for the people and, following the principles of democratic centralism, their decisions are binding for lower bodies of government."
 JER_expand_mines:0 "The People's Mines"
 JER_expand_mines_desc:0 "Mineral wealth is the primary fuel for industrialization, yet the capitalist pigs used it mostly to enrich themselves. Now it shall enrich the party and the people as we take the mines from them! Already we have plans to greatly expand production and draft many more workers."
 JER_railroads_commie:0 "Connect the Nation"
 JER_railroads_commie_desc:0 "Before the revolution, investors were mostly interested in building railroads that were profitable, leaving many towns and cities disconnected from the capital. How can we hope to have central control of the economy without proper infrastructure? Plans must be made to address this issue at once."
 
 JER_liberal_industry:0 "Economic Populism"
 JER_liberal_industry_desc:0 "We are servants of the people, chosen by them to improve their lives and ensure peace and prosperity for the entire nation. Thus, our policies must be guided by the desires of the common griffon, not by the greed of magnates, bankers and industrialists."
 JER_mechainsed_agriculture:0 "Tractor Grants"
 JER_mechainsed_agriculture_desc:0 "Mechanizing our agriculture would greatly increase production, ensuring every citizen in Aquileia remains well fed. Yet it is expensive and many farmers are too poor to afford it. Generous government grants are the solution, allowing everyone to buy a tractor or two."
 JER_railroads:0 "The Autoroute"
 JER_railroads_desc:0 "Many urbanites are acquiring cars to make travel easier, yet for the most part can only use them in cities as the roads on the countryside are in poor condition. Grand construction projects must be initiated, funded by the government. Wide paved roads will soon crisscross the entire nation, connecting the urban centers and boosting the economy."
 JER_land_reforms:0 "Land Redistribution"
 JER_land_reforms_desc:0 "Under the oppressive rule of the Discret dynasty, land was bought from the poor and granted to loyal aristocrats who soon amassed huge tracts of land. We must undo this crime and seize excessive land, then give it to those without any. Reformed ownership laws will protect the commoners from exploitation by the rich and create a fair and just society."
 JER_national_factories:0 "Industrial Grants"
 JER_national_factories_desc:0 "Creating a business is hard, and it's even harder to maintain one. To boost our growth and development, we must support our industrial sector with government grants, helping struggling businesses to stay afloat long enough so they can recover and stand on their own paws."
 JER_welfare_shit:0 "The Welfare State"
 JER_welfare_shit_desc:0 "It is the resposibility of the nation to take care of their citizens and provide them financial aid, healthcare and education. Social security programs will ensure every griffon, no matter their status, can meet their basic needs. It means the rich will have to pay more taxes, but clearly they can afford to do so."
 
 JER_corporate_industry:0 "A Guiding Claw"
 JER_corporate_industry_desc:0 "Aquileia has a great potential for industrial production and in the coming times of conflict that potential will need to be realized. To ensure this, the economy will be reorganized by cooperating with the large industrial corporations already present within the nation."
 JER_oil_refinery:0 "Synthetic Oil Experiments"
 JER_oil_refinery_desc:0 "Aquileia possesses no natural oil deposits within its current borders, and we have thus been reduced to relying on foreign trade to supply the economy's ever-growing thirst for oil. Investing in the construction of several synthetic oil refineries to ensure that we are not deprived of our petroleum supply during wartime is necessary, as a modern military cannot fight without oil."
 JER_domestic_arms:0 "The Military-Industrial Complex"
 JER_domestic_arms_desc:0 "By forging an alliance between our army and the industries that supply it, we can ensure that the full might of Aquileian industry is focused on supporting the military. The expanding army will require more equipment, which will fuel the expansion of the factories used to make that equipment, creating a formidable cycle of growth and expansion."
 JER_infrasctructure_program:0 "Divisions du Travail"
 JER_infrasctructure_program_desc:0 "Ever since the pathetic revolutionaries that attempted to overthrow the government were crushed, we have found ourselves with a large number of prisoners sitting in our dungeons. Putting these criminals to work will give us a large number of workers to use in various state construction projects, and relieve us of the duty to pay the workers for their labor."
 JER_corporate_industry_development:0 "Lower the Income Tax"
 JER_corporate_industry_development_desc:0 "Aquileia maintains a fairly high income tax, and while this does produce a large amount of funds to put towards government projects, it has also discouraged rich griffons from investing in new industries within the nation. Fortunately, have managed to strike deals with several rich investors, where in exchange for us lowering the income tax they will finance the construction of several new factories."
 JER_armed_nation:0 "A Nation in Arms"
 JER_armed_nation_desc:0 "Our nation is prepared to do anything and everything to secure its borders and reclaim lands lost during the revolution. Ergo, each and every one of us must be prepared to do our part to keep our military- and by extension our country- armed and prepared for conflict."
 
 JER_education_industry:0 "The Aquileian Academy of Practical Science"
 JER_education_industry_desc:0 "The Aquileian Academy of Practical Science has been a project in limbo for decades. Originally slated to open 15 years ago as a grand institution of learning and research, continued instability combined with a lack of funds and workers has left the project unfinished for far too long. With the recent improvements made to the economy, we are finally capable of finishing this project and moving on to larger ones."
 JER_the_illegal_dam:0 "The Westkeep Dam"
 JER_the_illegal_dam_desc:0 "The idea of damming the river near Westkeep has long been considered an enticing one, with the potential to produce truly immense amounts of electricity if the project were ever to be completed. While construction has been progressing at a steady pace, directly investing in the project would allow it to finish years ahead of schedule, and make the benefits from the endeavor available for our use."
 JER_the_pridea_shipyards:0 "The Shipyards of Pridea"
 JER_the_pridea_shipyards_desc:0 "Pridea has long been considered an important port within Aquileia, with the dockyards of the city having produced a sizable amount of ships for our navy over the years. By expanding the shipyards already present and constructing new ones, we can greatly expand the naval production capacity of our nation."
 JER_the_orvaillo_mines:0 "The Orvalillo Coal Mines"
 JER_the_orvaillo_mines_desc:0 "Orvalillo has long been one of the largest sources of coal within Auqelia, having supplied the country and surrounding areas with coal for years. But recent instability within the region has forced the mines to close, leaving a large source of coal within Aquileia unexploited. Financing the reopening and expansion of the mines would be trivial, and the benefits would make themselves obvious within weeks."
 JER_the_oil_fields_of_greifwald:0 "The Oil Fields of Bois-Grypés"
 JER_the_oil_fields_of_greifwald_desc:0 "The area of Bois-Grypés, which the Imperials call Greifwald, has recently been reincorporated back into Aquileia, and the vast oil fields of the region are now at our disposal. The fields themselves are far from capacity, and expanding the existing drilling operations in the area would provide us with a large amount of oil to fuel the ever-expanding economy."
 JER_modern_industrial_methods:0 "Modern Industrial Methods"
 JER_modern_industrial_methods_desc:0 "Aquileian industry is far from modern, with many factories using equipment that is hopelessly out of date. Thankfully, through the establishment of the Academy of Practical Science, we have attracted several industry experts to our country, ones that are ready to launch a program of modernizing the vast industries of Aquileia."
 JER_electronics_effort:0 "Electronic Investments"
 JER_electronics_effort_desc:0 "The continued advancements in the field of electronics have made it clear that the future is electric. We have reached a point where electronic machines have become vital in many industries, and especially within the army. We cannot afford to lag behind our rivals in this field, and financing new electronic projects will ensure that we keep pace with the rest of the world."
 JER_racial_research:0 "The Vyzima Cultural Institute"
 JER_racial_research_desc:0 "Aquileian culture is the envy of the world, with the sophisticated and elegant ways of the Aquileian griffons being known across the world. Establishing a new institute in Vyzima to sponsor the continued development of our culture will surely be a popular move with the griffons. Such an institute would also allow us to expand our research efforts into magical enchantments, a field we would be fools to ignore."
 JER_nuclear_research:0 "Project Grand Garçon"
 JER_nuclear_research_desc:0 "Crystals have the potential to unleash truly devastating amounts of energy in an incredibly short time. Some even theorize that the ability to wipe entire cities from the map will soon be available to those to harness the power of crystals. This new force must be researched quickly, as our enemies are no doubt doing the very same, and as such a project to research and develop the first weapon of mass destruction shall start."
 JER_a_beautiful_city:0 "The Jewel of the West"
 JER_a_beautiful_city_desc:0 "Our capital Aquila is a city of great culture and industry, and ever since its founding, has been considered the jewel of western Griffonia. And despite everything that our great nation has suffered through the decades, the jewel of the west is still the envy of the world. If Aquila is to maintain its position as a great city, then we must invest in expanding and developing it."
 
 JER_navy_reform:0 "La Marine Nationale"
 JER_navy_reform_desc:0 "With the Nation unified once again, there is one more slight on our honour which has to be repaired. When the nation was broken apart, so was much of the navy partitioned amongst the Discrets. Now that Aquileia is a nation once again, the Marine Nationale will be reforged once more!"
 JER_cat_base_strike_f:0 "Whitequill's Naval Aviation"
 JER_cat_base_strike_f_desc:0 "Gunther Whitequill is a naval theorist from a noble Heartlander family, but his naval theory is most innovative. He proposes a navy centred on aircraft carriers, ships that could house squadrons of naval bombers which can sink conventional enemy ships before they even reach firing range, or even while they are still in port. Aquileia must embrace naval aviation!"
 JER_cat_trade_interdiction_f:0 "Rousselot's Modern Piracy"
 JER_cat_trade_interdiction_f_desc:0 "We must face the fact that we lack the naval tradition of the Imperials or the Wingbardians. It may well be possible that we will not be able to out build our main competitors on the sea. Albert Rousselot has a solution for us. Forego naval engagements in favour of raiding the enemy’s supplies. Even with a smaller investment, we can hit our foe where it hurts. "
 JER_cat_fleet_in_being_f:0 "Aquileios' Grand Fleet"
 JER_cat_fleet_in_being_f_desc:0 "A nation’s stature is determined by the size of her fleet. We must forbid any dishonourable tactics from our fleet, lest it will bring shame to our nation. Instead, Aquileia will have the grandest fleet of any nation. Our navy will inspire awe in the sailors of lesser fleets and our battleships will make short work of those who dare oppose us!"
 JER_naval_planes_f:0 "Naval Aviation Experimentation"
 JER_naval_planes_f_desc:0 "Aircraft Carriers bring their own challenges to aircraft design. Carrier planes will have to take off and land with a shorter runway. The standard aircraft models simply will not work under these conditions. With scientific rigour, we will discover what works and what doesn’t and soon we will be able to fill our carriers with their deadly cargo."
 JER_heavy_cruiser_f:0 "Commission New Battlecruisers"
 JER_heavy_cruiser_f_desc:0 "A capital ship comes in many sizes, but the battlecruiser model will be the mainstay of our surface attack groups. Relatively cheap to produce, but still a cut above any cruiser, these ships are already the mainstay of our fleet. Modernising these battlecruisers will be an easy way to increase our navy’s potency. "
 JER_destroyer_f:0 "The Trade Fleet"
 JER_destroyer_f_desc:0 "Aquileia, being a modern nation by all standards, is deeply embedded in the global trade system and our merchant marine sail the world’s ocean, flying our colours with pride! However, these ships are in danger from pirates and submarines when unescorted. Modern destroyers will be able to patrol our waters and fend off any attack on our trade vessels."
 JER_light_cruiser_f:0 "Light Cruiser Experimentation"
 JER_light_cruiser_f_desc:0 "Specialisation may be a luxury we cannot afford right now, but cruisers are the answers to our troubles. These ships are versatile and can fill many roles within the fleet. Light cruisers can serve as heavy destroyers, protecting our trade, while heavier cruisers will be able to serve as capital ships for any task group which lacks a battlecruiser. Let us specialise in an all-round fleet."
 JER_battleships_f:0 "The Grandest Ships"
 JER_battleships_f_desc:0 "Our fleet must equal the prestige and glory of the rest of the nation and therefore we cannot lag behind in the construction of battleships. These beautiful ships, manned by our best sailors, will be the pride of the nation. Wherever they go, all will be amazed at our beautiful battleships!"
 JER_expand_the_dockyards:0 "Expand the Shipyards"
 JER_expand_the_dockyards_desc:0 "If our grand plans are to be enacted in a timely fashion, our naval facilities must be expanded. We will construct two new dry docks in Aquila and expand the naval base in the area. There will always be griffons in the underbelly of the city looking for a job, so it will be no problem to get these dry docks working. "
 JER_carrier_experiments:0 "Carrier Experiments"
 JER_carrier_experiments_desc:0 "Fleet Carriers are at the cutting edge of our technological capabilities. They will not only be required to launch and house squadrons of fighters. They need countermeasures against aircraft and submarines and a way to house the crew and pilots, while simultaneously functioning as a mobile command centre for a fleet commander or admiral. For Aquileia, we will see it done."
 JER_submarine_experiments:0 "The Hidden Fleet"
 JER_submarine_experiments_desc:0 "When we looks at the immense ocean that lies before us, our very eyes are deceiving us. We are looking at a mirror which jealously guards the secret of what hides below its surface. While our battleships and carriers distract our unwitting foes, the hidden fleet sails below the mirror, undisturbed. And when the ocean finally reveals her secrets, it will have been too late. . ."
 JER_further_expansion:0 "La Maison de la Marine"
 JER_further_expansion_desc:0 "Aquila is not only our undisputed capital and the centre of arts, science and civilisation, but it is also quickly becoming the home of the fleet. Many a chanson tells our sailors’ desire to see the piers of home once again and to the cacophony of sounds emanating from her docks. We must use this inspiration to work ever harder on our fleet, so that her size may inspire jealousy in our rivals."
 JER_doctrinal_development:0 "New Élan"
 JER_doctrinal_development_desc:0 "Our efforts to reinvigorate the Marine Nationale has not gone unnoticed by the citizenry. New sailors are being mustered every day and we simply lack the capacity to educate everygriffon wishing to be an officer. This new talent will surely server us well!"
 JER_naval_academy:0 "l’Académie Navale de Pridea"
 JER_naval_academy_desc:0 "Pridea has had custody over a large part of the national navy while our nation was divided. We can thank the local government for having had the foresight to establish their own naval academy. We will reopen and expand this institution, so that we can train all the hopeful officers of the future."
 JER_marine_f:0 "Troupes de la Marine"
 JER_marine_f_desc:0 "Controlling the ocean is but the first step in securing the enemy lands and forcing a surrender. Unfortunately, enemy beaches tend to be well fortified obstacles. The Marine Nationale will be expanded with the Troupes de la Marine. These elite infantry units are specialised in ship to ship warfare and amphibious operations. With them, we will be able to follow up a successful naval strike with a proper invasion."
 JER_landing_craft_f:0 "Improve Our Landing Craft"
 JER_landing_craft_f_desc:0 "The Troupes de la Marine need to actually get to the coast, if we are to launch any successful invasion. Although we considered letting the marines fly towards the enemy, an airborne approach makes them easy targets for enemy fire. We will have to design all-weather armoured transports to protect them until they can get in effective firing range."
 JER_expanding_the_marines:0 "Expand the Troupes de la Marine"
 JER_expanding_the_marines_desc:0 "The marines are the elite of our armed forces, but sadly there are just not enough of them at the moment. This is nothing that a few inspiring speeches, a few visits to the countryside and a more forgiving recruitment standard can’t fix! Let us get to work to expand our special forces to the level where they are not only a tactical, but a strategic threat."
 JER_semper_fi:0 "Premier Au Combat"
 JER_semper_fi_desc:0 "Our honourable and unbeaten forces hunger for battle! To follow the banner of Aquileia means to not fear battle, but to seek it!

 JER_the_greatest_fleet:0 "La Grande Flotte"
 JER_the_greatest_fleet_desc:0 "The renaissance of our fleet has seen our neglected navy grow into the pride of the nation. Many in our nation equal the rise of the navy to the rise of Aquileia as a whole, and there may be some truth in that. However, we are far from done. With ever increasing vigour and meticulous diligence, our fleet will grow in size, until it will outshine all who dare thread the ocean fair!"
 
 JER_new_airforce:0 "Armée de l'Air d'Aquileia"
 JER_new_airforce_desc:0 "The Aquileian air force started out as a part of the army, which was natural for griffons already accustomed to the gift of flight. It is time to make a new department to oversee our aircraft, the Aquileian Army of the Air!"
 JER_astrium_contract:0 "The Astrium Contract"
 JER_astrium_contract_desc:0 "Astrium Aviation is seeking an exclusive contract with the government.

We will take Astrium up on their offer and consider an air army based around ground support."
 JER_safran_contract:0 "The Safran Contract"
 JER_safran_contract_desc:0 "Safran has caught wind of our efforts to increase the capabilities of our aircraft.

 JER_thales_contract:0 "The Thales Contract"
 JER_thales_contract_desc:0 "Thales seeks to produce heavier aircraft for our airfleet. The company is known for their reliable tractors and they maintain that their engines will work just as well in the air. Of course, if they are to devote themselves to the aircraft industry, they will require government incentive."
 JER_fighter_f:0 "The Falcons of Aquileia"
 JER_fighter_f_desc:0 "In the days of old, our chivalrous knights would duel in the skies, for the honour of their liege or the attention of a fair lady! Those days are past, as our knights now wear rifles into combat and duelling is outlawed. The legacy of these aerial warriors lives on in the courageous falcons, our fighter pilots. These duellists will outclass any opponent!"
 JER_heavier_fighters:0 "Armoured for our Falcons"
 JER_heavier_fighters_desc:0 "Modern duels, sadly, are way more dangerous than back in the days of chivalry. Our falcons fly in agile craft with ample firepower, but one bad hit can send them spiralling down to their untimely deaths. To prevent this, we must provide our falcons with the best armour these planes can carry!"
 JER_bomber_f:0 "Bomber Experiments"
 JER_bomber_f_desc:0 "The impact of aerial warfare on the ground is not to be underestimated. Large aircraft can carry a payload of bombs that can obliterate an armoured column or even a factory! However, to strike with any measure of precision, we will have to do more than simply have passenger craft throw out bombs from the sky. We need specialised bomber planes."
 JER_strat_bomber_f:0 "Strategic Destruction"
 JER_strat_bomber_f_desc:0 "Smaller bombers can have an impact on a tactical scale, taking out a key enemy position or production facility. However, a war is rarely won in a single battle.

 JER_flight_academy:0 "l’Institut d'Aérodynamique"
 JER_flight_academy_desc:0 "l’Institute d’Aérodynamique de Aquileia was one of the pioneers of motorised flight when the invention reached our continent, but it remains at the centre of innovation! Investing into the institute will help us to teach new pilots and improve our airplanes!"
 JER_CAS_f:0 "Supporting Our Troops"
 JER_CAS_f_desc:0 "Although airplanes offer incredible mobility, they mean nothing if our forces on the ground get obliterated. We need to make an effort to produce smaller, agile bombers that can support the troops. When we come from above, our enemy will never sleep safely again."
 JER_no_trees:0 "No Trees Left Standing"
 JER_no_trees_desc:0 "The stakes in modern war are beyond reasonable. Everything is gambled, the very soul of our nation, everything that makes us Aquileian.

Republican and communist supporters have managed to quickly overwhelm, apprehend or eliminate loyalist forces in several regions, throwing the country into chaos.\n\nThe Republic is fiercely opposed by the monarchist supporters, who have sworn to destroy the revolutionary spirit once and for all.

 JER_memories:0 "Memories of the Republic"
 JER_memories_desc:0 "Shortly after the collapse of the Griffonian Empire the Kingdom of Aquileia experienced a revolution of its own.\n\nThe Revolution itself abolished the Discret Monarchy, and resulted in the proclamation of the First Aquileian Republic with Theodore Vérany at its head. Unfortunately, only five years after the Republic was created Marshal Berthelot led a counter-revolution which resulted in the Discret Restoration.\n\nIn spite of the Restoration there are still many within the country who refuse to let go of the dream of an Aquileian Republic thus making King Moriset's hold on the country tenuous at best."

 aquileia.16.t:0 "The Revolution"
 aquileia.16.d:0 "In a stunning display of boldness and élan, former exile Théodore Vérany returned to Aquileia, an army of Aquileian peasantry and formerly hidden supporters at his back, and stormed the Royal Palace, capturing the King and proclaiming the creation of the Second Aquileian Republic, as both the Aquileian Republican Army and Socialists fought the Aquileian military in the streets themselves. Time will tell what this means for the country, as it falls once again into bloodshed."
 aquileia.16.a:0 "Long live the Republic!"

 aquileia.17.t:0 "The Day of Reckoning"
 aquileia.17.d:0 "With the surrender of the Royalist forces in the old Aquileian military, the Republican victory was secured, and Monarchy was again abolished within the country. Having to decide what to do in regards to the deposed king, Vérany and his followers decided upon political irony, and sentenced the former king to death by the king’s preferred method of execution: the Guillotine. With his head firmly separated from his body, the King is quite dead, and with him, any hopes of monarchy in Aquileia."
 aquileia.17.a:0 "Sic semper tyranis."

 aquileia.18.t:0 "The Elections"
 aquileia.18.d:0 "With the Second Republic’s victory, the time has come for the important vote that will decide the political future of the feudal country. Everygriff has been incentivised to vote, and vote collectors are beginning to scour the countryside. The people of Aquileia have three major choices for head of state to choose from: Théodore Vérany, Hero Of both the First and the Second Aquileian Revolution, and running on the platform of free markets and liberal rights for each and every griffon. Cécile Gaudreau, of the Aquileian Worker’s Party- a moderate socialist looking to blend socialism and capitalism into a well-oiled and fluid state. Or, finally, Victor Allard- another influential member of the PAT and radical leftist, preaching purely socialist ideals, often times citing Stalliongradian methods in his public speeches."
 aquileia.18.a:0 "FJA retains a majority and Théodore Vérany remains president!"
 aquileia.18.b:0 "PAT-M gains a majority under Cécile Gaudreau!"
 aquileia.18.c:0 "PAT-R gains a majority under Victor Allard!"

 aquileia.19.t:0 "The Loose Ends"
 aquileia.19.d:0 "In a grimly political move, the current government swiftly and methodically dealt with what it felt were several loose ends within the PAT, as agents of the Aquileian government were reported to execute potentially hostile elements in their perceived opposition. Notables include several political and military advisory griffons for the government, as well as Field Marshall Victor Moreau who was shot, and General Félix Murat, who was reportedly poisoned."
 aquileia.19.a:0 "Another threat to the establishment dealt with."

 aquileia.20.t:0 "The New Republic"
 aquileia.20.d:0 "With his political victory secure, Victor Allard proclaimed the formation of the Aquileian People’s Republic today, and announced several relatively fast reformation plans for the country, as he solidifies his new government. Decrying the Capitalist Bourgeoisie as Monarchist Shills, Allard has spoken out radically against liberal as Monarchist forms of government, proclaiming that Socialism is the proper way forward for the country."
 aquileia.20.a:0 "It's good to be the General Secretary."

 aquileia.21.t:0 "The Exile of Victor Allard"
 aquileia.21.d:0 "In a shocking move today, the PAT and FJA came together in the government to publicly disavow and declare Persona-Non-grata Victor Allard, a formerly major influence within the PAT, and radical socialist. Personally disgusted with the turn of events, and wanting nothing else to do with politics, Allard left the country today in self-imposed Exile, to whereabouts unknown."
 aquileia.21.a:0 "Another threat to the establishment dealt with."

 aquileia.22.t:0 "A New Republic"
 aquileia.22.d:0 "Today marks a historic day in Aquileian history. Building upon their success during the Revolution and learned lessons during our political times of turmoil, the Democratic government has announced the gradual reform of our government into a proper Federated Republic, as a Republic is more capable than a direct democracy, without threatening the voice of the average griffon."
 aquileia.22.a:0 "Long live the Federation!"

 aquileia.23.t:0 "An Invitation to the Entente"
 aquileia.23.d:0 "It seems that the Aquileians being quite proud of their new Republic have decided to invite us into something called the Entente - apparently it is intended to be an alliance of Democracies in Griffonia and would provide both financial and military assistance to all members. Should we join?"

 aquileia.26.b:0 "We don't need the Aquileians."

 aquileia.27.t:0 "The Republic Accepts"
 aquileia.27.d:0 "The Griffonian Republic has accepted."
 aquileia.27.a:0 "Wonderful!"

 aquileia.28.t:0 "The Republic Declines"
 aquileia.28.d:0 "The Griffonian Republic had declined."
 aquileia.28.a:0 "Bollocks!"

 aquileia.29.t:0 "The Fate of the Kingdom"
 aquileia.29.d:0 "Upon the insistence of Marshal Rodier, a strict Ultranationalist dedicated to all things Aquileian, the king must now decide whether to stand firm and remain the absolute monarch of Aquileia, to whom all power resides, or to allow the Marshal and his cronies into the government as a prime minister, supposedly to provide support for the king whilst calming the Ultranationalists in government."
 aquileia.29.a:0 "The Maréchal has some interesting ideas."
 aquileia.29.b:0 "The King's rule is absolute."

 aquileia.30.t:0 "The Death of Marshal Berthelot"
 aquileia.30.d:0 "Marshal Berthelot, the griffon most responsible for the destruction of the First Aquileian Republic and the restoration of Moriset Discret to the throne of Aquileia passed away today at the age of 87. The old Marshal was found dead in his manor in Vyzima by one of his servants, a quick examination proved that Berthelot had passed away naturally and a funeral procession was organised by his family and friends. Although Berthelot is seen as a hero by some Aquileians the majority of our people considered him a scoundrel and a lackey of the Discret family, thus making both him and his death a deeply dividing matter."
 aquileia.30.b:0 "Rest in peace old friend."

 aquileia.39.t:0 "The Maréchal Leaves"
 aquileia.39.d:0 "To the surprise of many, Marshal Rodier whom up until recently had been rather receptive of the new Republican Government has decided to leave Aquileia, apparently the Marshal declared the MPA a failed organisation and Aquileia a dead nation, and left for the Griffonian Empire, what he will do next is anyone's guess."
 aquileia.39.a:0 "Good riddance."
 
 aquileia.41.t:0 "The Pascal Affair"
 aquileia.41.d:0 "The Republic is gripped with suspicion and paranoia as an artillery officer within our fair republic's army was placed under arrested, having been suspected of sending letters to correspondents within the Empire! To think that one of our fair citizens would attempt to exchange information and secrets with the power-hungry despots in Griffenheim is horrifying and almost unbelievable! There in lies the problem however, independent investigations have concluded that Pascal was not sending these letters, after interviewing his fellow officers as well as his own family. They considered him a "True Patriot to the Republic, and would give his life for it." Many suspect that the Policegriffons sent to arrest him placed these false documents within his home, and that these griffons were agents of the MPA, hoping to stir up anti-pony sentiment. Whatever the case may be, all Ponies within the republic are to be closely watched now."
 aquileia.41.a:0 "These are not our republican ideals!"
 
 aquileia.42.t:0 "Zolavi Passes Away"
 aquileia.42.d:0 "Notable journalist and novelist Émile Zolavi has recently died, in his old home on the Aquilan outskirts. His writing career has inspired a new trend in Aquileian culture, short-lived as it was, and his outspoken approach even convinced the government to loosing their grip on the society. His most notorious action, however, was a full scale condemnation of the ruling officials during the Pascal affair. His caustic, inflammatory accusation spared none, and he was quickly sued for libel. As a result, Zolavi escaped abroad to New Mareland, where he continued to defend his close friend Pascal. He was only recently permitted to return, but the stress of his prosecution has left him weary of life. The government of Aquileia has decided to name their newly formed literature prize after Zolavi, to honour his contribution to society. "
 aquileia.42.a:0 "His books weren't that bad, really."
 
 aquileia.43.t:0 "Rabble-rousing Griffon Causes Mischief"
 aquileia.43.d:0 "Voracious lover of life and dandy, Charles Beaklaire was well known in the artistic circles of Aquila for his rather divisive poetry. While a vocal minority considered his work to be a rejuvenation of art, far more considered them to be works of complete debauchery. The numerous lawsuits and charges of defiling public morals have not deterred Beaklaire from publishing more verses on themes of modernity, love and wine. Additionally, he has taken it personally to confront his critics, causing multiple public brawls. This has resulted in many griffons receiving serious injuries, as Beaklaire is overly fond of the bottle, and great damage to public property. Recently however, his brief stint in the prison has somewhat mellowed him out, yet his works continue to cause much controversy in the cafés of Aquila."
 aquileia.43.a:0 "Artists are a rather special bunch."
 
 aquileia.44.t:0 "Plumus Publishes L’Étranger"
 aquileia.44.d:0 "Albert Plumus is a name that has quickly risen in the artistic circles of Aquileia. His absurdist approach towards life, which is widespread in his works, has attracted many griffons, weary of the constant wars raging across the world. He has recently finished his newest novel, titled L’Étranger (The Outsider), which follows Griffsault and his indifferent lifestyle. The critics praised the main character's disposition towards life, authority and religion, stating that these are the proper values for the uncertain times. Thus, the book has quickly became an integral part of any Aquileian's shelf."

 JER_election_radicals_desc:0 "Clearly the people have spoken, and the people want to become a socialist state- now! It is time to institute our reforms as quickly as possible, for a better state. We will take charge in all matters of state, from the top down, and the bottom up."
 JER_anti_clericalism:0 "Anti-Clericalism"
 JER_anti_clericalism_desc:0 "No gods, no masters. We are our own people, not to be weighted down with the dalliances of ancient and outdated religions. It is time for the new griffon to come into it's own, not weighed down by mythology and old fashioned, backwards, and frankly idiotic thinking. A griffon chooses- A slave obeys fake gods."
 JER_assassinate_moderates:0 "Tie Any Loose Ends"
 JER_assassinate_moderates_desc:0 "With our victory secure, we can now take steps to secure our political position for the foreseeable future. We must take the initiative to remove our political enemies from the field of play- by any and all means necessary."
 JER_commissars:0 "CSE Commissar Divisions"
 JER_commissars_desc:0 "While our Comité is making great strides and has done excellent work for while it's been in existence, we can expand upon them and improve their day to day effectiveness by developing dedicated Commissariat divisions, both to expand their reach and increase their in-field usefulness."
 JER_hunt_democrats:0 "Hunt Down the FJA"
 JER_hunt_democrats_desc:0 "We can now take strides to erase the right wing bureaucrats from office completely. We must do so quickly, without mercy and without falter, so that our victory can be fully secure, with both the moderate sellouts and the Bourgeoisie Capitalists dead and gone from memory. Only then can we truly call ourselves the true government of Aquileia."
 JER_rapid_industralisation:0 "Rapid Industrial Development"
 JER_rapid_industralisation_desc:0 "The quickest way to garner public support is to fix our decaying industrial sector, and greatly improve it. We'll build new factories as quickly as possible, both improving our capabilities, and making us more popular in the populace's eyes."
 JER_commie_army:0 "Form the Aquileian Revolutionary Army"
 JER_commie_army_desc:0 "Our old army was pathetic at best, and useless at worst. If we are to secure our government for good and keep ourselves and our people safe, we must form a new army- and quickly."
 JER_communists:0 "The Dictatorship of the Proletariat"
 JER_communists_desc:0 "Our country is making great strides- and we shall continue these strides. Of the people, for the people, shall be our motto and our means to an end. We shall make ourselves the model of a Socialist state, to be looked at with respect and reverence. We, above all else, shall be a true worker's paradise, free from the shackles of Capitalist societies and their outdatedness."
 JER_education_soc:0 "Education Reforms"
 JER_education_soc_desc:0 "If we are to begin converting our populace to the wonders of Socialism, we must first begin educating the masses, so as to help them understand why our Socialist state is superior to the Monarchy of old, and to bring up smarter, more well-informed griffons."
 JER_education_soc_finish:0 "A Communist Education"
 JER_education_soc_finish_desc:0 "We must finish our education reforms as quickly as possible, to help to bring forth the new Socialist griffon. While we have already made good strides in educating the illiterate masses, we must finish the re-education campaign, pulling ourselves up kicking and screaming by our bootstraps if we must."
 JER_griffonian_revolution:0 "A New Revolution"
 JER_griffonian_revolution_desc:0 "Our own revolution is complete, however, across Griffonia, the people still find themselves oppressed under the heels of Monarchists and dictators. Our revolution has ended, but the revolution to free the continent of Griffonia is only just beginning."
 JER_integrate_FEZ:0 "Integrate the Old Lands"
 JER_integrate_FEZ_desc:0 "Now that we have a few moments to rest upon our laurels, we must fully integrate all the old Aquileian states into our new Socialist State."
 JER_final_battle:0 "A Flame the Ages Shall Not Extinguish"
 JER_final_battle_desc:0 "It is time to strike against the most glaring voice of dissent against our way of life; the most vile of states, the old Griffonian Empire. A pathetic shrivelled shadow of what it once was, the Empire needs to be fully crushed again, never to return."
 JER_KGB:0 "Comité pour la sécurité de l'État"
 JER_KGB_desc:0 "With Aquileia firmly under our grasp we must now make sure that reactionaries both at home and abroad never again have a chance to threaten our beloved Republic. To ensure the safety of the public and the state a new intelligence agency shall be created for this exact purpose."
 
 JER_election_moderates:0 "A Victory for the Moderates"
 JER_election_moderates_desc:0 "In a fair democratic election, we have won a great victory for socialism. However, our work cannot stop there. We still have much to do, and little time with which to do it."
 JER_election_moderates:0 "Resource Nationalisation"
 JER_election_moderates_desc:0 "One of our first steps toward a proper and free socialist state is to nationalise the resources away from the monopolistic companies of the old regime. Whilst we should still promote businesses by value of keeping a limited and controlled market, we should still give out incentives to boost productivity and keep people interested in investing into our resource networks."
 JER_national_industry:0 "Limited Nationalisation"
 JER_national_industry_desc:0 "Building upon our earlier incentives towards limited markets, we should, in some capacity, nationalise our industrial sector. While there will be some privatisation still, as that is conducive to keeping investors interested and therefore keeping our technology up to date, we should place ideal restrictions upon some industries to prevent Capitalistic or Monopolistic tendencies from running rampant."
 JER_reconcile_with_archon:0 "Reconcile With the Clergy"
 JER_reconcile_with_archon_desc:0 "While the new Socialist griffon does not have a need for the old ways of religion, we should not go out of our way to antagonise the clergy, considering that they still have a wide base of support amongst all parties in our new republic. Ergo, we should make amends, so as to keep civil discourse between our two groups, and to appease the people. In the end, it is up to them, after all, to decide whether the old ways will survive or die."
 JER_education:0 "Free Education"
 JER_education_desc:0 "Before the introduction of the Republic, Education was only for the wealthy and Bourgeoisie noble classes. If we are to continue forward with our Republic, we must address this issue, and quickly."
 JER_bernie_sanders:0 "Free Healthcare"
 JER_bernie_sanders_desc:0 "One of our first steps towards a free and proper, modern socialist state should be to provide the masses with free health care. In doing this, we ensure every griffon's future at a low expense, and we will be able to also garner a wider base of support, as people will feel thankful for the free aid."
 JER_militia_army:0 "An Army of Militias"
 JER_militia_army_desc:0 "While not the most orthodox or centralised military, our new militia model army will be one to be respected. Our goal is to raise several local militias, each with their own fairly elected officer corps, which will serve as reservists, keeping their day jobs until it is required to take up arms to defend our way of life."
 JER_the_republic:0 "Reclaim the Old Borders"
 JER_the_republic_desc:0 "We must bring our new, free, Socialist way of life to our old border states, both to liberate their working force from the tyrannical heel of Monarchism, and to reclaim our ancestral homes from said tyrants."
 JER_education_finish_moderates:0 "Educate the Masses"
 JER_education_finish_moderates_desc:0 "While our education reforms have proven quite successful, we must finish our reforms, to bring our people fully into the modern waking world."
 JER_aquileian_revolution:0 "The Home of the Free"
 JER_aquileian_revolution_desc:0 "With our people finally reunited under one banner, we must now look to securing our state against any and all outside aggression. We must also quickly reintegrate our old lands into our new state. Therefore, new centres of government and new border defences must be established, for our allies are few, and our enemies are many."
 JER_partisans_effort:0 "No Surrender"
 JER_partisans_effort_desc:0 "There shall be not one step backwards! We must defend our lands to the end, whether in victory or in defeat, but we shall be forever remembered as the staunchest of defenders, unwilling to give up a single scrap of open ground to our enemies. Each inch shall be fought over as if it were a mile, and each mile, as if it were a city."
 JER_infrasctructure_project:0 "Railroad Projects"
 JER_infrasctructure_project_desc:0 "The steam powered locomotive is truly the way forward into the modern era. As such, we should invest in this method of transportation, to truly prove to the world how far we have come, and how far we can, in the future, go."
 JER_industry_buildup:0 "Industrial Buildup"
 JER_industry_buildup_desc:0 "With our new state-backed railroad networks in place, we should also see about hooking them up to our industrial base. Ergo, we must build up new infrastructure and industry to benefit this, and to set a precedent for future industrial endeavours."
 JER_industry_projects:0 "State Armouries"
 JER_industry_projects_desc:0 "In addition to industrial and infrastructure reforms and advances, we should also take some time to set up some state-backed armouries for a few local militias. This should ease the burdens on our armaments organisers, and help to better equip our militias for any current or future conflicts they must partake in."
 JER_resource_nationalisation:0 "Resource Nationalisation"
 JER_resource_nationalisation_desc:0 "The first of many steps for our newly established administration, the state will commit the seizure of deposits of valuable metals. The state will promise that these metals will be wisely used to ensure the protection of our citizens."
 
 JER_election_democracy:0 "A Victory for Freedom"
 JER_election_democracy_desc:0 "We have won a fair and just democratic victory! Despite worries about our socialist brethren that aided us in our struggles, Democracy has prevailed. It is now time to focus on our new country; our new Republic."
 JER_government_unity:0 "Form a Coalition Government"
 JER_government_unity_desc:0 "While our Socialist brothers were defeated in a fair democratic election, we cannot alienate and isolate them from government. Instead, we must offer them the olive branch of peace, and form a joint FJA-PAT coalition as our governmental institution. This will not only garner us a wide support base, but will also help to soothe tensions between us and the PAT."
 JER_federation:0 "The Aquileian Federated Republic"
 JER_federation_desc:0 "Now that we have secured our internal standing, we must look outwards to the Republic's former border states. Now, we must decide how we are going to deal with said states, which are tellingly still shackled by their tyrannical monarchs and feudalistic rulers."
 JER_federal_reserve:0 "Form the Federal Reserve"
 JER_federal_reserve_desc:0 "We need to form a backable and sustainable reserve of funds for public works projects, that we can draw upon for future works, such as industrial reforms or infrastructural projects. Forming a national bank and national reserve would be an excellent first step for this."
 JER_outer_states:0 "The Outer Republics"
 JER_outer_states_desc:0 "It is time to reintegrate our border states into proper Republican states within our Federated Republic. To do this, however, will take a fight of it's own, as there is little doubt the Monarchists will fight tooth and nail to keep their power to themselves, and out of the talons of their people."
 JER_entente:0 "Allies on the Homefront"
 JER_entente_desc:0 "We should look for allies wherever we are capable of garnering them, whether here or abroad. Alone we shall fall, or together we shall overcome."
 JER_invite_TRD:0 "Invite the Skyfall Federation"
 JER_invite_TRD_desc:0 "We should invite the Skyfall Trade Federation to our Entente, to secure their free trade routes and to garner an ally with ready access to the sea, and the world abroad."
 JER_invite_FAT:0 "Invite the Northern Republicans"
 JER_invite_FAT_desc:0 "We should invite the Far Northern Republicans within the Griffon Republic to our Entente, in preparations for any aggression from the decaying Empire. We must support our fellow Republicans, wherever and whenever possible."
 JER_war_against_empire:0 "Once More Unto the Breach"
 JER_war_against_empire_desc:0 "The Time has come to defeat Monarchism and it's Feudal grip on free griffons everywhere. Once more unto the breach must we march, for Liberty, Equality, and Peace forevermore in Griffonia!"
 JER_reclaim_riverlands:0 "Reclaim the Outer Republics"
 JER_reclaim_riverlands_desc:0 "It is time to topple the Monarchs within the old Border states, and liberate our Brethren, to truly make Aquileia free for all griffons, regardless of upbringing or background."
 JER_final_preperations:0 "The Final Preparations"
 JER_final_preperations_desc:0 "The time is nearly here to end feudalistic tyranny upon our home continent of Griffonia, by striking at the black heart of the Empire to our North. Before we can do that, however, we must make our final preparations to bring ourselves to a full war footing with the coming foe. If we are unready, then we shall surely lose. Nothing can be left to chance."
 JER_education_fixing:0 "Every Griffon an Education"
 JER_education_fixing_desc:0 "Every griffon, be they Nobility or the common griffon, deserves the right to a fair and full education. As we are now in a position to promote this, we must make good on our political promises and do so, so that we may bring ourselves into a new age of enlightenment."
 JER_industry_construction:0 "Industrial Projects"
 JER_industry_construction_desc:0 "Aside from our Education reforms, we should also take strides to improve our outdated industrial sector, so that we can continue to compete with the rest of the Continent."
 JER_education_finalised:0 "An Educated Nation"
 JER_education_finalised_desc:0 "Our education reforms have come far, but there is still more to do. We still have much work ahead of us if we are to truly call ourselves an Educated and Enlightened Nation."
 JER_guard_republica:0 "Form the Republican Guard"
 JER_guard_republica_desc:0 "We must develop a standardised and professional military, to defend our borders and our way of life from any exterior threats: not an army of hatred and tyranny, as in the olden days, but one of defence, and justice."
 JER_the_plot:0 "Take Care of the Radicals"
 JER_the_plot_desc:0 "Regardless of our Socialist allies' pledges of allegiance, there are clearly some elements of the far left that refuse to fall in line with our ideals, despite our victory over them in the election. We must decide what our plans are to be in regards to dealing with these types, before something terrible happens."
  
 JER_commie_industry:0 "A Planned Economy"
 JER_commie_industry_desc:0 "An unpredictable and unfair market economy benefits the rich and harms the poor. It is clear our government must assume direct control of production, distribution and prices to ensure wealth is spread evenly among all. Though perhaps the leaders of the party shall receive a little more as a reward for their work."
 JER_new_workers:0 "The New Aquileian Worker"
 JER_new_workers_desc:0 "The new worker has no master, no employer he unwillingly serves in order to survive. The employees shall work for not only themselves but for the nation as a whole, loyally serving the state, producing for use instead of profit and sharing the fruits of their labour with their comrades."
 JER_nationalisation_of_factories:0 "Factories For the Working Griffon"
 JER_nationalisation_of_factories_desc:0 "The means of production belong to those that use them! We must seize factories from greedy private companies for ourselves. We, the state, represent the people, and thus the people shall own the factories. Nationalization is vital for the eventual transition into stateless communism. Trust us."
 JER_industrial_commitee:0 "Form the Comité Industrielle d'Aquileia"
 JER_industrial_commitee_desc:0 "A central committee composed of members of the party shall be formed to direct the economy and draft long-term plans for development and modernization. The committee knows what is best for the people and, following the principles of democratic centralism, their decisions are binding for lower bodies of government."
 JER_expand_mines:0 "The People's Mines"
 JER_expand_mines_desc:0 "Mineral wealth is the primary fuel for industrialization, yet the capitalist pigs used it mostly to enrich themselves. Now it shall enrich the party and the people as we take the mines from them! Already we have plans to greatly expand production and draft many more workers."
 JER_railroads_commie:0 "Connect the Nation"
 JER_railroads_commie_desc:0 "Before the revolution, investors were mostly interested in building railroads that were profitable, leaving many towns and cities disconnected from the capital. How can we hope to have central control of the economy without proper infrastructure? Plans must be made to address this issue at once."
 
 JER_liberal_industry:0 "Economic Populism"
 JER_liberal_industry_desc:0 "We are servants of the people, chosen by them to improve their lives and ensure peace and prosperity for the entire nation. Thus, our policies must be guided by the desires of the common griffon, not by the greed of magnates, bankers and industrialists."
 JER_mechainsed_agriculture:0 "Tractor Grants"
 JER_mechainsed_agriculture_desc:0 "Mechanizing our agriculture would greatly increase production, ensuring every citizen in Aquileia remains well fed. Yet it is expensive and many farmers are too poor to afford it. Generous government grants are the solution, allowing everyone to buy a tractor or two."
 JER_railroads:0 "The Autoroute"
 JER_railroads_desc:0 "Many urbanites are acquiring cars to make travel easier, yet for the most part can only use them in cities as the roads on the countryside are in poor condition. Grand construction projects must be initiated, funded by the government. Wide paved roads will soon crisscross the entire nation, connecting the urban centers and boosting the economy."
 JER_land_reforms:0 "Land Redistribution"
 JER_land_reforms_desc:0 "Under the oppressive rule of the Discret dynasty, land was bought from the poor and granted to loyal aristocrats who soon amassed huge tracts of land. We must undo this crime and seize excessive land, then give it to those without any. Reformed ownership laws will protect the commoners from exploitation by the rich and create a fair and just society."
 JER_national_factories:0 "Industrial Grants"
 JER_national_factories_desc:0 "Creating a business is hard, and it's even harder to maintain one. To boost our growth and development, we must support our industrial sector with government grants, helping struggling businesses to stay afloat long enough so they can recover and stand on their own paws."
 JER_welfare_shit:0 "The Welfare State"
 JER_welfare_shit_desc:0 "It is the resposibility of the nation to take care of their citizens and provide them financial aid, healthcare and education. Social security programs will ensure every griffon, no matter their status, can meet their basic needs. It means the rich will have to pay more taxes, but clearly they can afford to do so."
 
 JER_corporate_industry:0 "A Guiding Claw"
 JER_corporate_industry_desc:0 "Aquileia has a great potential for industrial production and in the coming times of conflict that potential will need to be realized. To ensure this, the economy will be reorganized by cooperating with the large industrial corporations already present within the nation."
 JER_oil_refinery:0 "Synthetic Oil Experiments"
 JER_oil_refinery_desc:0 "Aquileia possesses no natural oil deposits within its current borders, and we have thus been reduced to relying on foreign trade to supply the economy's ever-growing thirst for oil. Investing in the construction of several synthetic oil refineries to ensure that we are not deprived of our petroleum supply during wartime is necessary, as a modern military cannot fight without oil."
 JER_domestic_arms:0 "The Military-Industrial Complex"
 JER_domestic_arms_desc:0 "By forging an alliance between our army and the industries that supply it, we can ensure that the full might of Aquileian industry is focused on supporting the military. The expanding army will require more equipment, which will fuel the expansion of the factories used to make that equipment, creating a formidable cycle of growth and expansion."
 JER_infrasctructure_program:0 "Divisions du Travail"
 JER_infrasctructure_program_desc:0 "Ever since the pathetic revolutionaries that attempted to overthrow the government were crushed, we have found ourselves with a large number of prisoners sitting in our dungeons. Putting these criminals to work will give us a large number of workers to use in various state construction projects, and relieve us of the duty to pay the workers for their labor."
 JER_corporate_industry_development:0 "Lower the Income Tax"
 JER_corporate_industry_development_desc:0 "Aquileia maintains a fairly high income tax, and while this does produce a large amount of funds to put towards government projects, it has also discouraged rich griffons from investing in new industries within the nation. Fortunately, have managed to strike deals with several rich investors, where in exchange for us lowering the income tax they will finance the construction of several new factories."
 JER_armed_nation:0 "A Nation in Arms"
 JER_armed_nation_desc:0 "Our nation is prepared to do anything and everything to secure its borders and reclaim lands lost during the revolution. Ergo, each and every one of us must be prepared to do our part to keep our military- and by extension our country- armed and prepared for conflict."
 
 JER_education_industry:0 "The Aquileian Academy of Practical Science"
 JER_education_industry_desc:0 "The Aquileian Academy of Practical Science has been a project in limbo for decades. Originally slated to open 15 years ago as a grand institution of learning and research, continued instability combined with a lack of funds and workers has left the project unfinished for far too long. With the recent improvements made to the economy, we are finally capable of finishing this project and moving on to larger ones."
 JER_the_illegal_dam:0 "The Westkeep Dam"
 JER_the_illegal_dam_desc:0 "The idea of damming the river near Westkeep has long been considered an enticing one, with the potential to produce truly immense amounts of electricity if the project were ever to be completed. While construction has been progressing at a steady pace, directly investing in the project would allow it to finish years ahead of schedule, and make the benefits from the endeavor available for our use."
 JER_the_pridea_shipyards:0 "The Shipyards of Pridea"
 JER_the_pridea_shipyards_desc:0 "Pridea has long been considered an important port within Aquileia, with the dockyards of the city having produced a sizable amount of ships for our navy over the years. By expanding the shipyards already present and constructing new ones, we can greatly expand the naval production capacity of our nation."
 JER_the_orvaillo_mines:0 "The Orvalillo Coal Mines"
 JER_the_orvaillo_mines_desc:0 "Orvalillo has long been one of the largest sources of coal within Auqelia, having supplied the country and surrounding areas with coal for years. But recent instability within the region has forced the mines to close, leaving a large source of coal within Aquileia unexploited. Financing the reopening and expansion of the mines would be trivial, and the benefits would make themselves obvious within weeks."
 JER_the_oil_fields_of_greifwald:0 "The Oil Fields of Bois-Grypés"
 JER_the_oil_fields_of_greifwald_desc:0 "The area of Bois-Grypés, which the Imperials call Greifwald, has recently been reincorporated back into Aquileia, and the vast oil fields of the region are now at our disposal. The fields themselves are far from capacity, and expanding the existing drilling operations in the area would provide us with a large amount of oil to fuel the ever-expanding economy."
 JER_modern_industrial_methods:0 "Modern Industrial Methods"
 JER_modern_industrial_methods_desc:0 "Aquileian industry is far from modern, with many factories using equipment that is hopelessly out of date. Thankfully, through the establishment of the Academy of Practical Science, we have attracted several industry experts to our country, ones that are ready to launch a program of modernizing the vast industries of Aquileia."
 JER_electronics_effort:0 "Electronic Investments"
 JER_electronics_effort_desc:0 "The continued advancements in the field of electronics have made it clear that the future is electric. We have reached a point where electronic machines have become vital in many industries, and especially within the army. We cannot afford to lag behind our rivals in this field, and financing new electronic projects will ensure that we keep pace with the rest of the world."
 JER_racial_research:0 "The Vyzima Cultural Institute"
 JER_racial_research_desc:0 "Aquileian culture is the envy of the world, with the sophisticated and elegant ways of the Aquileian griffons being known across the world. Establishing a new institute in Vyzima to sponsor the continued development of our culture will surely be a popular move with the griffons. Such an institute would also allow us to expand our research efforts into magical enchantments, a field we would be fools to ignore."
 JER_nuclear_research:0 "Project Grand Garçon"
 JER_nuclear_research_desc:0 "Crystals have the potential to unleash truly devastating amounts of energy in an incredibly short time. Some even theorize that the ability to wipe entire cities from the map will soon be available to those to harness the power of crystals. This new force must be researched quickly, as our enemies are no doubt doing the very same, and as such a project to research and develop the first weapon of mass destruction shall start."
 JER_a_beautiful_city:0 "The Jewel of the West"
 JER_a_beautiful_city_desc:0 "Our capital Aquila is a city of great culture and industry, and ever since its founding, has been considered the jewel of western Griffonia. And despite everything that our great nation has suffered through the decades, the jewel of the west is still the envy of the world. If Aquila is to maintain its position as a great city, then we must invest in expanding and developing it."
 
 JER_navy_reform:0 "La Marine Nationale"
 JER_navy_reform_desc:0 "With the Nation unified once again, there is one more slight on our honour which has to be repaired. When the nation was broken apart, so was much of the navy partitioned amongst the Discrets. Now that Aquileia is a nation once again, the Marine Nationale will be reforged once more!"
 JER_cat_base_strike_f:0 "Whitequill's Naval Aviation"
 JER_cat_base_strike_f_desc:0 "Gunther Whitequill is a naval theorist from a noble Heartlander family, but his naval theory is most innovative. He proposes a navy centred on aircraft carriers, ships that could house squadrons of naval bombers which can sink conventional enemy ships before they even reach firing range, or even while they are still in port. Aquileia must embrace naval aviation!"
 JER_cat_trade_interdiction_f:0 "Rousselot's Modern Piracy"
 JER_cat_trade_interdiction_f_desc:0 "We must face the fact that we lack the naval tradition of the Imperials or the Wingbardians. It may well be possible that we will not be able to out build our main competitors on the sea. Albert Rousselot has a solution for us. Forego naval engagements in favour of raiding the enemy’s supplies. Even with a smaller investment, we can hit our foe where it hurts. "
 JER_cat_fleet_in_being_f:0 "Aquileios' Grand Fleet"
 JER_cat_fleet_in_being_f_desc:0 "A nation’s stature is determined by the size of her fleet. We must forbid any dishonourable tactics from our fleet, lest it will bring shame to our nation. Instead, Aquileia will have the grandest fleet of any nation. Our navy will inspire awe in the sailors of lesser fleets and our battleships will make short work of those who dare oppose us!"
 JER_naval_planes_f:0 "Naval Aviation Experimentation"
 JER_naval_planes_f_desc:0 "Aircraft Carriers bring their own challenges to aircraft design. Carrier planes will have to take off and land with a shorter runway. The standard aircraft models simply will not work under these conditions. With scientific rigour, we will discover what works and what doesn’t and soon we will be able to fill our carriers with their deadly cargo."
 JER_heavy_cruiser_f:0 "Commission New Battlecruisers"
 JER_heavy_cruiser_f_desc:0 "A capital ship comes in many sizes, but the battlecruiser model will be the mainstay of our surface attack groups. Relatively cheap to produce, but still a cut above any cruiser, these ships are already the mainstay of our fleet. Modernising these battlecruisers will be an easy way to increase our navy’s potency. "
 JER_destroyer_f:0 "The Trade Fleet"
 JER_destroyer_f_desc:0 "Aquileia, being a modern nation by all standards, is deeply embedded in the global trade system and our merchant marine sail the world’s ocean, flying our colours with pride! However, these ships are in danger from pirates and submarines when unescorted. Modern destroyers will be able to patrol our waters and fend off any attack on our trade vessels."
 JER_light_cruiser_f:0 "Light Cruiser Experimentation"
 JER_light_cruiser_f_desc:0 "Specialisation may be a luxury we cannot afford right now, but cruisers are the answers to our troubles. These ships are versatile and can fill many roles within the fleet. Light cruisers can serve as heavy destroyers, protecting our trade, while heavier cruisers will be able to serve as capital ships for any task group which lacks a battlecruiser. Let us specialise in an all-round fleet."
 JER_battleships_f:0 "The Grandest Ships"
 JER_battleships_f_desc:0 "Our fleet must equal the prestige and glory of the rest of the nation and therefore we cannot lag behind in the construction of battleships. These beautiful ships, manned by our best sailors, will be the pride of the nation. Wherever they go, all will be amazed at our beautiful battleships!"
 JER_expand_the_dockyards:0 "Expand the Shipyards"
 JER_expand_the_dockyards_desc:0 "If our grand plans are to be enacted in a timely fashion, our naval facilities must be expanded. We will construct two new dry docks in Aquila and expand the naval base in the area. There will always be griffons in the underbelly of the city looking for a job, so it will be no problem to get these dry docks working. "
 JER_carrier_experiments:0 "Carrier Experiments"
 JER_carrier_experiments_desc:0 "Fleet Carriers are at the cutting edge of our technological capabilities. They will not only be required to launch and house squadrons of fighters. They need countermeasures against aircraft and submarines and a way to house the crew and pilots, while simultaneously functioning as a mobile command centre for a fleet commander or admiral. For Aquileia, we will see it done."
 JER_submarine_experiments:0 "The Hidden Fleet"
 JER_submarine_experiments_desc:0 "When we looks at the immense ocean that lies before us, our very eyes are deceiving us. We are looking at a mirror which jealously guards the secret of what hides below its surface. While our battleships and carriers distract our unwitting foes, the hidden fleet sails below the mirror, undisturbed. And when the ocean finally reveals her secrets, it will have been too late. . ."
 JER_further_expansion:0 "La Maison de la Marine"
 JER_further_expansion_desc:0 "Aquila is not only our undisputed capital and the centre of arts, science and civilisation, but it is also quickly becoming the home of the fleet. Many a chanson tells our sailors’ desire to see the piers of home once again and to the cacophony of sounds emanating from her docks. We must use this inspiration to work ever harder on our fleet, so that her size may inspire jealousy in our rivals."
 JER_doctrinal_development:0 "New Élan"
 JER_doctrinal_development_desc:0 "Our efforts to reinvigorate the Marine Nationale has not gone unnoticed by the citizenry. New sailors are being mustered every day and we simply lack the capacity to educate everygriffon wishing to be an officer. This new talent will surely server us well!"
 JER_naval_academy:0 "l’Académie Navale de Pridea"
 JER_naval_academy_desc:0 "Pridea has had custody over a large part of the national navy while our nation was divided. We can thank the local government for having had the foresight to establish their own naval academy. We will reopen and expand this institution, so that we can train all the hopeful officers of the future."
 JER_marine_f:0 "Troupes de la Marine"
 JER_marine_f_desc:0 "Controlling the ocean is but the first step in securing the enemy lands and forcing a surrender. Unfortunately, enemy beaches tend to be well fortified obstacles. The Marine Nationale will be expanded with the Troupes de la Marine. These elite infantry units are specialised in ship to ship warfare and amphibious operations. With them, we will be able to follow up a successful naval strike with a proper invasion."
 JER_landing_craft_f:0 "Improve Our Landing Craft"
 JER_landing_craft_f_desc:0 "The Troupes de la Marine need to actually get to the coast, if we are to launch any successful invasion. Although we considered letting the marines fly towards the enemy, an airborne approach makes them easy targets for enemy fire. We will have to design all-weather armoured transports to protect them until they can get in effective firing range."
 JER_expanding_the_marines:0 "Expand the Troupes de la Marine"
 JER_expanding_the_marines_desc:0 "The marines are the elite of our armed forces, but sadly there are just not enough of them at the moment. This is nothing that a few inspiring speeches, a few visits to the countryside and a more forgiving recruitment standard can’t fix! Let us get to work to expand our special forces to the level where they are not only a tactical, but a strategic threat."
 JER_semper_fi:0 "Premier Au Combat"
 JER_semper_fi_desc:0 "Our honourable and unbeaten forces hunger for battle! To follow the banner of Aquileia means to not fear battle, but to seek it! Our marines will be the first to the fight and the last to leave. Our officers are equally as daring, planning grand invasions quickly, so that our forces can surprise and overwhelm our foes!"
 JER_the_greatest_fleet:0 "La Grande Flotte"
 JER_the_greatest_fleet_desc:0 "The renaissance of our fleet has seen our neglected navy grow into the pride of the nation. Many in our nation equal the rise of the navy to the rise of Aquileia as a whole, and there may be some truth in that. However, we are far from done. With ever increasing vigour and meticulous diligence, our fleet will grow in size, until it will outshine all who dare thread the ocean fair!"
 
 JER_new_airforce:0 "Armée de l'Air d'Aquileia"
 JER_new_airforce_desc:0 "The Aquileian air force started out as a part of the army, which was natural for griffons already accustomed to the gift of flight. It is time to make a new department to oversee our aircraft, the Aquileian Army of the Air!"
 JER_astrium_contract:0 "The Astrium Contract"
 JER_astrium_contract_desc:0 "Astrium Aviation is seeking an exclusive contract with the government.

 JER_thales_contract:0 "The Thales Contract"
 JER_thales_contract_desc:0 "Thales seeks to produce heavier aircraft for our airfleet. The company is known for their reliable tractors and they maintain that their engines will work just as well in the air. Of course, if they are to devote themselves to the aircraft industry, they will require government incentive."
 JER_fighter_f:0 "The Falcons of Aquileia"
 JER_fighter_f_desc:0 "In the days of old, our chivalrous knights would duel in the skies, for the honour of their liege or the attention of a fair lady!

These duellists will outclass any opponent!"
 JER_heavier_fighters:0 "Armoured for our Falcons"
 JER_heavier_fighters_desc:0 "Modern duels, sadly, are way more dangerous than back in the days of chivalry. Our falcons fly in agile craft with ample firepower, but one bad hit can send them spiralling down to their untimely deaths. To prevent this, we must provide our falcons with the best armour these planes can carry!"
 JER_bomber_f:0 "Bomber Experiments"
 JER_bomber_f_desc:0 "The impact of aerial warfare on the ground is not to be underestimated. Large aircraft can carry a payload of bombs that can obliterate an armoured column or even a factory! However, to strike with any measure of precision, we will have to do more than simply have passenger craft throw out bombs from the sky. We need specialised bomber planes."
 JER_strat_bomber_f:0 "Strategic Destruction"
 JER_strat_bomber_f_desc:0 "Smaller bombers can have an impact on a tactical scale, taking out a key enemy position or production facility. However, a war is rarely won in a single battle.

 JER_CAS_f:0 "Supporting Our Troops"
 JER_CAS_f_desc:0 "Although airplanes offer incredible mobility, they mean nothing if our forces on the ground get obliterated. We need to make an effort to produce smaller, agile bombers that can support the troops. When we come from above, our enemy will never sleep safely again."
 JER_no_trees:0 "No Trees Left Standing"
 JER_no_trees_desc:0 "The stakes in modern war are beyond reasonable. Everything is gambled, the very soul of our nation, everything that makes us Aquileian.

 JER_revolution_category_desc:0 "Shortly after the collapse of the Griffonian Empire the Kingdom of Aquileia experienced a revolution of its own.\n\nThe Revolution itself abolished the Discret Monarchy, and resulted in the proclamation of the First Aquileian Republic with Theodore Vérany at its head. Unfortunately, only five years after the Republic was created Marshal Berthelot led a counter-revolution which resulted in the Discret Restoration.\n\nIn spite of the Restoration there are still many within the country who refuse to let go of the dream of an Aquileian Republic thus making King Moriset's hold on the country tenuous at best."

The Baron himself was a Pirate lord for years before he was called to action by his family during the republican revolution. In the following years he asserted himself in a strong position politically by using the hyperloyal §GPony Minorities§! as a police force to control the city and influence his small army.\n\nDuring the revolution, §GPridea§! was under the control of §RThe Communards§! who formed the autonomous §RCommune of Pridea§!. Until §YBaron Dennis Discret§! sailed into the gulf of Pridea and shelled the city with his navy. After a brief urban land battle, the Pirate Lord announced himself Baron of the city in the name of the king. The communards and other republicans who got captured were taken to a now §Rinfamous wall§! next to the center of the old city where §Rthey were shot five by five§! until the Baron had run out of traitors to execute. \n\nIn the new year of 1007 §Rrevolutionary fervor§! is now spreading across Aquileia once more.

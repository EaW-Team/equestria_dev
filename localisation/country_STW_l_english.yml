 STW_death_of_a_friend:0 "The Passing of Grover"
 STW_death_of_a_friend_desc:0 "With the passing of Grover V, events within the empire are about to unfold as the regency debate comes to the forefront of imperial politics. Still, this can wait as Gabriela take a moment to honour the passing of a close friend and family member. Backroom deals and power politics are for after she mourns the passing of a great Griffon."
 STW_pu_time:0 "Two Nations, One Ruler"
 STW_pu_time_desc:0 "The last few weeks have been a flurry of backroom deals, shifting alliances, and politics fought at the highest levels of imperial authority. However, Gabreila sits proud as the regent of Grover VI. Though, this does mean that she is de facto the ruler of two separate nations, a job that might be too much for even a griffoness of her stature."
 
 STW_choose_a_regent:0 "Gabriela's Regency"
 STW_choose_a_regent_desc:0 "Gabriela's duties keep her locked within Griffenheim, denying her homeland of sound judgement and leadership. With this in mind, she begins the process of finding a regent for her griffons."
 
 STW_commie_boy:0 "Vitalius Moonbill"
 STW_commie_boy_desc:0 "Vitalius Moonbill is minor noble who owns a smattering of land throughout Strawberry. He is a close friend and confidant of Gabriela, always offering a lucrative avenue of advice in her relation towards the working-class populace of her duchy. While some have expressed concern towards his republican and leftist views, the Duchess expresses full faith in her friend."
 STW_pope_boy:0 "The Prelate of Osnabeak"
 STW_pope_boy_desc:0 "The Prelate of Osnabeak is currently filled by Julius Eagleclaw, Gabriela's Uncle. While a staunchly religious griffon, he is an able administrator and has always showed great loyalty to his brother and later niece. However, some within our court question if this loyalty will continue to be upheld as Gabriela enters into direct conflict with the Archon."
 STW_loyalist:0 "Baroness Regina Eagleclaw"
 STW_loyalist_desc:0 "Baroness Regina Eagleclaw is a close cousin and friend of the Duchess, being a trusted ally for the entirety of her reign. The two of them are like-minded in their harmonic beliefs, and with her in charge, there would be no doubt that Gabriela's vision for Strawberry will be carried out diligently and with no hesitation."
 
 #Fash/Commie
 STW_forceful_cooperation:0 "For Strawberry"
 STW_forceful_cooperation_desc:0 "Our loyalty to the griffons of Strawberry trumps our loyalty to Gabriela. We must do everything in our power to ensure the security of our nation, and to accomplish such a goal, we must commit ourselves fully to modernizing our state."
 STW_combat_illiteracy:0 "Eradicate Illiteracy"
 STW_combat_illiteracy_desc:0 "Factory labour is not like other low wage work, it requires a bare minimum level of literacy in order to understand the operation of the complex machinery necessary for such enterprises. As such, if we wish to industrialize, we must first go about tackling the illiteracy which plagues our nation."
 STW_finish_illiteracy:0 "De Bezige Bij"
 STW_finish_illiteracy_desc:0 "Strawberry does not have a domestic printing industry, meaning we rely heavily upon foreign imports to stock our shelves and libraries. To address this, our government has established 'De Bezige Bij' a company which will print books by Strawberry's authors, using Strawberry paper, for Strawberry markets. After all, without books how can we maintain literacy?"
 STW_start_modernisation:0 "Import Modern Equipment"
 STW_start_modernisation_desc:0 "From our factories to our farms, our workers toil using tools, machinery, and techniques which are decades behind the most advanced nations on the planet. In order to address this problem, our government must import machinery from foreign producers in order to help bridge this technological divide."
 STW_finished_modernisation_com_fash:0 "A Modern Nation"
 STW_finished_modernisation_com_fash_desc:0 "As Strawberry blazes into the 11th Century, it has made up much ground, bridging the gap towards full industrialization. Everyday more factories and workshops are opening within our cities as rural labour bloats our growing urban centres. It won't be long before we stand as the beacon of modernity on the continent."
 STW_seize_land_for_the_industry:0 "Appropriate the Land of the Nobility"
 STW_seize_land_for_the_industry_desc:0 "The nobility of Strawberry still holds great tracks of land, running them in a very similar manner to their feudal forefather. This means that much of our economic potential is being artificially held back by mismanagement and greed. As such, we must seize these lands from the aristocracy and use them for the benefit of all griffons."
 STW_knights_of_Strawberry:0 "Knightly Tradition"
 STW_knights_of_Strawberry_desc:0 "Even in the face of modernisation it is still important to hold onto certain archaic institutions. One such institution is the knighthood, a class of warriors who dedicate themselves to the protection of their lands. With a modernized twist a new generation of knights could be raised from the common populace to defend Strawberry valiantly from all threats."

 STW_Reward_Loyalty_Commie:0 "For The People"
 STW_Reward_Loyalty_Harmony:0 "For Gabriela"
 STW_reward_loyalty_desc:0 "Our loyalty to Gabriela has ensured that the wealth and resources of Griffenheim will be offered to us in assisting with domestic issues. Chiefly this will come in the form of helping to address our rampant illiteracy and struggling manufacturing sector."
 STW_spread_books:0 "From the Griffenheim Presses"
 STW_spread_books_desc:0 "We can not hope to tackle illiteracy without books and other written material. Thankfully, the largest printing presses in Griffonia are located within Griffenheim. With their help, thousands of volumes will begin to flood our schools, libraries, and bookstores, offering our population access to books that would've been unheard of mere years ago."
 STW_expand_illiteracy_programs:0 "Griffenheim Educational Grants"
 STW_expand_illiteracy_programs_desc:0 "Books are good and all, but are useless if the Griffon doesn't know how to read. In order to address this, we have requested imperial grants from Griffenheim in order to hire and pay the salaries of a new generation of teachers who will become the backbone of a non-secular ministry of education. Their work will do wonders in finally smashing illiteracy."
 STW_start_subsidies:0 "Industrial Subsidies"
 STW_start_subsidies_desc:0 "Strawberry's infant industrial sector struggles against the might of Griffenheim's, producing lower quality and more expensive products. With trade between our two regimes growing, it has become imperative that we subsidize these firms, using imperial grants, so they are able to compete on a more level playing field."
 STW_finished_modernisation_com_loyal:0 "Import Modern Agricultural Equipment"
 STW_finished_modernisation_com_loyal_desc:0 "Farming within Strawberry is handled in a very similar manner to what our ancestors did centuries ago, meaning that is labour intensive and inefficient. By importing modern equipment from Griffenheim, we can greatly increase the efficiency of our agricultural sector, freeing up labour to work in the burgeoning factories of Readewetter."
 STW_expand_the_industry_council:0 "Establish the Industry Council"
 STW_expand_the_industry_council_desc:0 "The Industry Council is an advisory board staffed by three domestic specialists and four specialists from Griffenheim. Their mission is to examine the feasibility of importing and implementing new industrial practices and technologies into the mills and factories of Griffenheim. It is hoped that with their help, Strawberry will be able to replicate the success of Griffenheim in modernizing."
 STW_FEA_cooperation:0 "Our Brothers"
 STW_FEA_cooperation_desc:0 "Feathisia has always been our brother nation, sharing a common history and language which binds our two peoples together. In this time of crisis, it is only appropriate that we approach our friends, looking to work together to overcome the conflict ahead."
 STW_join_the_zentralbank:0 "Strawberry's Zentralbank"
 STW_join_the_zentralbank_desc:0 "When the Zentralbank collapsed, it brought down the entire Empire's economy, shaking the common populace's trust in banking. However, with the empire's resurgence, under Gabriela, it has become feasible to reopen this institution, strengthening trade and commerce between the regimes still aligned with Griffenheim."
 STW_defenders_of_the_monarchy:0 "Defence Against Our Enemies!"
 STW_defenders_of_the_monarchy_desc:0 "Strawberry stands as a bulwark, aligned behind Gabriela's Griffenheim. In the event of war our homeland could become a battleground and the citizens of our duchy must stand ready to sacrifice in the name of our righteous cause."
 
 #Loyalist
 STW_two_nations_one_ruler:0 "An Independent Strawberry?"
 STW_two_nations_one_ruler_desc:0 "With Gabriela's authority over the Griffon Empire solidified there has been a raging debate amongst our nobles over the future of Strawberry. Some have proposed that we remain independent of Griffenheim, maintaining the status quo enjoyed for generations. On the other talon, there are those who think a merger of our two regimes would offer us the brightest and most peaceful future."
 STW_closer_cooperation:0 "Embrace Griffenheim"
 STW_closer_cooperation_desc:0 "At Gabriela's instruction, Regina has embarked upon the long process of opening up Strawberry to further imperial administration. While the initial phase is little more than promise-making, it is still a necessary first step in unifying our two regimes."
 STW_special_snowflake:0 "Distance Ourselves"
 STW_special_snowflake_desc:0 "While we do appreciate warm relationships with Griffenheim it is important to remember that we are a separate entity from the empire, regardless of who our ruler may be. So, against the wishes of Gabriela, we must make it known that we will remain firm in our independence."
 STW_economical_cooperation:0 "Economic Cooperation"
 STW_economical_cooperation_desc:0 "Strawberry is a land rich in raw resources but poor in industry. Meanwhile, Griffenheim is poor in resources but rich in industry. By unifying our economies, we not only take a necessary step in tying together our regimes but also offer a lucrative trade arrangement which can benefit both of our nations."
 STW_leave_me_alone:0 "Separate but United"
 STW_leave_me_alone_desc:0 "While we have distanced ourselves from Griffenheim, it doesn't mean that our regime is unloyal to Gabriela or flagging in her cause. As such, we must make a statement assuring the empire that we stand united with our Duchess and are committed to her cause of unifying the empire once again."
 STW_open_communications:0 "No Secrets Between Friends"
 STW_open_communications_desc:0 "With Gabriela's command of both nations, she has asked for a greater degree of transparency between the ministers of both, allowing our government a greater insight into the affairs of Griffenheim and the empire as a whole."
 STW_mutual_benefits:0 "Equalization Payments"
 STW_mutual_benefits_desc:0 "The wealth of the empire flows into Griffenheim, greatly enriching the city and its surrounding provinces. While Strawberry is by no means poor, a system of equalization payments made from Griffenheim to Readewetter could help smooth over lingering economic inequalities that might hinder integration."
 STW_diplomatical_missions:0 "Little Sister Diplomacy"
 STW_diplomatical_missions_desc:0 "Strawberry has very much become the little sister to the Empire, meaning we have an important role to play as a moderating voice in foreign affairs. Where Griffenheim might not be able to afford tact and level-headedness, we can come in and mediate and a more diplomatic solution."
 STW_economical_integration:0 "Economic Integration"
 STW_economical_integration_desc:0 "Growing trade between Strawberry and the Empire has greatly benefited both sides. Though, it has also created a dependency, with Griffenheim factories relying on Strawberry's iron, coal, and minerals, while Strawberry merchants rely on the goods of Griffenheim's factories. As such, it's about time that we invested in formalizing the integration of our two economies to ensure no disruptions occur."
 STW_an_unique_position:0 "A Unique Opportunity"
 STW_an_unique_position_desc:0 "As the crisis draws ever closer, the forges and factories of Griffenheim have gone into overdrive, producing the weapons and equipment needed to arm the growing Imperial Army. With our vast mineral and resource deposits, we are in a prime position to profit from this military build up. Who isn't game for a little war profiteering?"
 STW_a_choice:0 "The Readewetter Accord"
 STW_a_choice_desc:0 "The Readewetter Accord is a formal declaration signed between Griffenheim and Readewetter, stating that the Empire will respect Strawberry's sovereignty and independence in exchange for industrial support, their loyalty and service in the upcoming civil war. "
 STW_appoint_new_counts:0 "New Ducal Administration"
 STW_appoint_new_counts_desc:0 "In Gabriela's absence, the administration of Strawberry has fallen to corrupt bureaucrats and civil servants appointed based on bribery and connections. In order to ensure the duchy's prosperity and survival, we must replace these incompetent individuals with qualified and abled griffons."
 STW_a_nobles_nation:0 "The Strawberry of Old"
 STW_a_nobles_nation_desc:0 "Strawberry has always stood as a bulwark of noble privilege and the old way of griffon life. Through the sound leadership of Regina Eagleclaw, Gabriela's vision for her griffons has been maintained and a stable future has been envisioned."
 
 #Commies
 STW_socialism:0 "Memory of the Republic"
 STW_socialism_desc:0 "While the Republican Uprising failed, their temporary occupation and administration of Strawberry's lands did foster the first embers of republican ideology. While these have long been stamped out, all it will take is a little spark to reignite the smolder."
 STW_the_people_rule:0 "Expand Political Rights"
 STW_the_people_rule_desc:0 "Strawberry is an absolute monarchy, with the only griffons with any political power being Gabriela, her regent, and a small cliché of advisors and ministers. This is not the way to run a modern nation. What Strawberry needs is an elected Ducal Assembly where griffons can vote in representatives to promote their interests."
 STW_we_are_the_people:0 "First Among Equals"
 STW_we_are_the_people_desc:0 "A strong central government is required in order to enact the various reforms necessary to modernize our duchy. While some might call this undemocratic, there have been many republics, which in times of crisis, have appointed strong executive councils to manage the state in such times."
 STW_some_are_more_equal:0 "The Grand Pensionary"
 STW_some_are_more_equal_desc:0 "Before the Eagleclaw clan completely assumed control over the Duchy of Strawberry, they were merely the Counts of Readewetter and the Stadtholders of Starclaw, Winterbell, and Osnabeak. In times of succession, a Grand Pensionary would be appointed to administer these various domains until a new Stadtholder was picked. With Gabriela's absence, it is time for the first in 200 years."
 STW_all_are_equal:0 "Expand Civil Liberties"
 STW_all_are_equal_desc:0 "In a modern nation there are certain rights which are bestowed upon all citizens of the realm. The freedom of speech, the freedom to move freely, and equal representation before the law being chief among them. As such, it is the duty of our regency to bestow our griffons with these most natural of rights."
 STW_planned_economy:0 "Planned Economy"
 STW_planned_economy_desc:0 "The problems of Strawberry's economy are unique and can not be properly resolved by relying upon the invisible talons of capital nor the markets. Instead, we must assume direct control over our industrial enterprises and manage them through government ministry and administrators. Only then can we ensure maximum efficiency."
 STW_small_business:0 "Break the Monopolies"
 STW_small_business_desc:0 "Within Strawberry, many goods and services are controlled by monopolistic firms and guilds who exert a huge amount of control over supply and pricing. In order to address this issue, we must break up the largest of these firms and sell off their assets to smaller firms, allowing for fair competition to take effect."
 STW_a_workers_nation:0 "Expand Social Rights"
 STW_a_workers_nation_desc:0 "As the wealth of Strawberry increases it becomes imperative that the worker's who toil to create it are rewarded by their state. The freedom from hunger, homelessness, and impoverishment are a revolutionary concept but one which our nation must embrace if we are to become a true beacon of liberty and prosperity in the world."
 STW_socialist_intelligence:0 "Socialist Education"
 STW_socialist_intelligence_desc:0 "Throughout the Griffonian continent many of the working class can not afford to even supply their chicks with a basic education, hampering social and economic development. In Strawberry we will adopt a different approach, offering subsidized education all the way though to university for students who are capable and willing."
 STW_better_red_than_dead:0 "Moonbill's Strawberry"
 STW_better_red_than_dead_desc:0 "The Strawberry of today is different from that of a mere decade ago. Our populace has been empowered, our economy prospers, and a rich system of social safety nets protect the poor from destitution. And it is all thanks to the dedication and hard work of Vitalius Moonbill."
 STW_the_people_army:0 "The Griffons' Army"
 STW_the_people_army_desc:0 "The Army of Strawberry is there to protect its people, not to protect the nobility. The entire nation shall know and we shall expand our recruiting efforts to make sure that no noble shall rule the nation alone!"

 #Pope Boy
 STW_voluentary_loyalty:0 "Secret Talks"
 STW_voluentary_loyalty_desc:0 "Gabriela is misguided, attempting to take action against the rightful regent of the empire. While, Julius loves his niece greatly he must do what his faith and morals oblige him. As such, he will attempt to make contact with the Archon and pledge assistance in the upcoming conflict."
 STW_recognise_the_three:0 "Recognise the Three"
 STW_recognise_the_three_desc:0 "The Council of Three is the only hope the Empire has to do away with the parasitic and unholy aristocracy which drain Griffenheim of its vigour and pollute the land with sin. As such, we must make it known, within appropriate circles, that we recognize this Council as the legitimate regency body."
 STW_the_knights_guard:0 "Align the Royal Guard"
 STW_the_knights_guard_desc:0 "Gabriela's royal guard has languished for years, withering away under budgetary restraints and mismanagement. This has made them a prime target for our administration. With a few promises of payment and restoration of glory, the Royal Guard can become the backbone of Strawberry's own branch of the Knights of Arcturius."
 STW_suck_pope_dick:0 "Approach the Archon"
 STW_suck_pope_dick_desc:0 "As our administration becomes more in line with the Archon's faction, it's about time that we send a delegation to him and make official contact. We will require his guidance in the months to come as we make the move towards breaking away from Gabriela."
 STW_a_commoners_man:0 "The Commoners"
 STW_a_commoners_man_desc:0 "During the regency crisis, the Archon attempted to align the common class against Gabriela. While dashed in these efforts, he did prove the latent political force that could be mobilized within the common populace. As such, we must make efforts to remind Strawberry's working class of their obligations to their gods rather than their Duchess."
 STW_industrialisation:0 "Invest the Tithes"
 STW_industrialisation_desc:0 "Strawberry's industrial base has fallen on hard times, rocked by the economic instability which plagues the continent. However, as we move away from Griffenheim we must establish an economy that can stand independent of the imperial city. As such, we must invest temple tithes into propping up struggling industrial enterprises and opening up new ones."
 STW_a_religious_man:0 "Holy Administration"
 STW_a_religious_man_desc:0 "Strawberry's administration has languished in Gabriela's absence with her corrupt ministers often appointing government officials based on family connections, favours, or good old fashion bribery. We must do away with these inefficient and incompetent individuals, replacing them with able bodied officials from the temples."
 STW_our_own_nation:0 "A nation loyal to the Archon"
 STW_our_own_nation_desc:0 "Soon the time will come to breakaway from Gabriela's regency and pledge our full and public support to the Archon's cause. While we are far from his power base in the south, our forces will prove a valuable asset in opening up a two-front war against the corrupt nobles in Griffenheim. We love thee Gabriela, but we love our gods more. For now, our entire nation is in line with the Archon's values and Eagleclaws influence is all but gone!"
 STW_our_own_empire:0 "Strawberry Stands Strong"
 STW_our_own_empire_desc:0 "Free of the Gabriela's influence, Strawberry has been allowed to prosper under the guidance of Julius Eagleclaw and the Archon. What stands before us is a powerful and modern nation which is ready to meet all threats to our cause, may they be domestic or foreign."
 STW_stab_the_opposition:0 "Decrease the Opposition"
 STW_stab_the_opposition_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts to show others the greatness of the Archon, some will not be swayed. A few supporters have found more rigorous methods of keeping the population in line with our ideals."
 
 # Intelligence
 STW_uni_readewetter:0 "The University of Readewetter"
 STW_uni_readewetter_desc:0 "The premier educational centre within Strawberry, the University of Readewetter offers the duchy's best science and legal faculties. With a bit of financing and governmental support, this institution could rise to be amongst the greatest in the entire Empire."
 STW_uni_starclaw:0 "The University of Starclaw"
 STW_uni_starclaw_desc:0 "The University of Starclaw has always played second fiddle to that in Readewetter. However, with a duchy renown theology and social science department, this university could be made to shine with proper investment and government influence."
 
 ### Eagleclaw in STW
 STW_sidelined:0 "Exile from Griffenheim"
 STW_sidelined_desc:0 "With the [STW.GetGRIFascistLeaderName]'s ascendancy to regent, Duchess Eagleclaw has been expelled from the Royal Court in Griffenheim. However, with her return to Readewetter, she won't remain idle for long, already looking to tackle her nation's domestic and foreign policy issues in order to pool together support for her claim to the regency."
 STW_ties_with_other_nations:0 "Allies Close and Far"
 STW_ties_with_other_nations_desc:0 "Our own Duchy is pitiful when compared to the entire might of the Empire. However, there are regimes friendly to our cause amongst the imperial states - and nations beyond the imperial boundaries might be swayed to invest in the cause of having a sound-minded regent guarding the emperor. Before we look outwards, however, looking closer home might be a good idea to secure the throne..."
 STW_hidden_resistance:0 "Spit Behind His Back"
 STW_hidden_resistance_desc:0 "While resistance to the [STW.GetGRIFascistLeaderName] is important, we must be cautious in how transparent we are on this stance. After all, the [STW.GetGRIFascistLeaderName] wields the Empire's might and could easily quash the embers of resistance forming against him. However, this secrecy would make it harder to rally support behind our banner."
 STW_open_resistance:0 "Spit in His Face"
 STW_open_resistance_desc:0 "We are a proud and independent duchy within the Griffon Empire and we can not allow Griffenheim to dictate our policies. No, we must stand proud and shout our resistance to the [STW.GetGRIFascistLeaderName], making it know that there are griffons who will not abide by his tyranny. While this will make us a target, it would also make it easier to coordinate and find allies."
 STW_gather_arms:0 "Gather Arms"
 STW_gather_arms_desc:0 "Political support is important but it alone will not win this coming crisis. No, we must stand ready to arm our populace in the event of war. However, to support such an army, we will require sufficient quantities of guns, bullets, shells, and other equipment."
 STW_sway_the_griff_nobles:0 "Align the Nobility"
 STW_sway_the_griff_nobles_desc:0 "The nobility is what really rules the Griffon Empire. Without their continued support, the apparatuses of the imperial bureaucracy would grind to a halt, finding themselves without skilled labour and local legitimacy. By bring the nobility in line with our agenda, we would severely undermine the authority and power of the [STW.GetGRIFascistLeaderName]."
 STW_approach_the_griff_commoners:0 "Align the Commoners"
 STW_approach_the_griff_commoners_desc:0 "In his rush to power, the [STW.GetGRIFascistLeaderName] mobilized the support of the common populace to terrifying effect. This has proven the importance of bringing the common classes in line with our political agenda. If we were able to bring them into our camp, we'd be robbing the [STW.GetGRIFascistLeaderName] of one of his most vital sources of power."
 STW_strike_the_archon:0 "Purge the Taint from Arcturius"
 STW_strike_the_archon_desc:0 "The [STW.GetGRIFascistLeaderName] has sullen the name and legacy of Griffonia for far too long, sitting as a virtual emperor in Griffenheim. It is our duty, as true rulers of Griffonia, to strike down the pretenders. Only then can Strawberry, and the Empire, overcome this era of crisis, and prosper."
 STW_social_reform:0 "A Modern Strawberry"
 STW_social_reform_desc:0 "In Eagleclaw's absence, Strawberry has been allowed to languish, entering a period of political and social stagnation. Feudalism, a medieval court system, corrupt guilds, archaic education, and indifferent advisors plague our nation, holding us back from modernizing and making us fragile in the face of the [STW.GetGRIFascistLeaderName]."
 STW_visit_public_schools:0 "Modernize our Legal Text"
 STW_visit_public_schools_desc:0 "Much of Strawberry's legal text was drafted in the early days of the duchy. This has created many problems, including the accumulation of laws no longer considered justice, the absence of laws regulating modern institutions, and all around a confusing literature which makes the practice of law timely and costly. With this in mind, we must rewrite and modernize Strawberry's legal text."
 STW_start_reading_programs:0 "The Ministry of Education"
 STW_start_reading_programs_desc:0 "An educated populace is a modern populace. It has been proven that a nation with high literacy is easily able to industrialize and adapt to changes in the world. As such, addressing gaps in basic literacy must be of the upmost importance to our administration. To aid in this, Eagleclaw has established a dedicated governmental organization with the duty of modernizing education."
 STW_economic_ties:0 "Break the Guilds"
 STW_economic_ties_desc:0 "The medieval guilds are a holdover from a simpler time. However, their monopolistic control over certain vital trades have stagnated the Strawberry economy. By breaking the guilds, and liberalizing the trade of such goods, we would see immediate benefit within our infant industrial sector."
 STW_modernisation_effort:0 "Remove Archaic Advisors"
 STW_modernisation_effort_desc:0 "With Eagleclaw's absence, the appointment of advisors to high-ranking position usually fell to the talons of regents who were looking to line their pockets or reward political allies. As such, there have been several questionable appointments in recent years. Now that the Duchess has returned, we can go about removing these individuals and appoint new advisors based on merit."
 STW_a_modern_nation:0 "A Modern Feudal Nation"
 STW_a_modern_nation_desc:0 "The feudal system was broken and not fitting for a duchy like Strawberry. We shall finish our reforms and truly be a nation where nobles and commoners are more equal than in any other nation!"
 STW_political_reform:0 "Return of the Duchess"
 STW_political_reform_desc:0 "The Duchess' absence has been felt by much of her domain, creating a general sense of apathy towards the crown and her cause. Any efforts to seize the regency will go nowhere without the support of our populace. As such, we must attempt to bridge this disconnect and rebuild the trust and respect of the Duchess in the eyes of her griffons."
 STW_the_duchess_speech:0 "The Duchess' Speech"
 STW_the_duchess_speech_desc:0 "There is a new technology taking up residence in homes across our country: the radio. Using this, a single griffon can reach out speak to millions all at once, with no need to assemble for a speech! We must exploit this technology to bring the Duchess's voice to as many griffons as possible."
 STW_royal_tours:0 "The Royal Tour"
 STW_royal_tours_desc:0 "Outside of Readewetter, many towns have failed to receive attention from the crown, having gone generations without an official visit. This issue has only been exacerbated by the Duchess' absence, creating a tension between the rural and urban citizenry. To remedy this, we have planned a pan-Strawberry road trip, bringing the Duchess to these long-ignored regions."
 STW_a_series_of_decrees:0 "The Royal Decrees"
 STW_a_series_of_decrees_desc:0 "Where the radio is non-existent, nor the populace great enough to support the roads necessary for our tour, there are still griffons who are our subjects. We must make some effort to reach these most isolated communities and remind them that they are a part of our crown and domains. To attempt this, air craft have been contracted to drop leaflets on these communities."
 STW_one_nation_against_the_archon:0 "One Nation United"
 STW_one_nation_against_the_archon_desc:0 "Our populace stands united at our back and the last vestiges of the [STW.GetGRIFascistLeaderName]'s influence have been purged from our lands. Now is the time to wield the might of our unified society and pledge the entirety of Strawberry towards the cause of ending the [STW.GetGRIFascistLeaderName]'s illegitimate regency."
 STW_expand_the_royal_guard:0 "Expand the Royal Guard"
 STW_expand_the_royal_guard_desc:0 "For years, the royal guard has continued to shrink in scope, decaying to only a small bodyguard unit that protects the Duchess. In the past however, this organization once acted as the eyes and ears of the crown, with their presence a constant knife in the backs of griffons who wished to harm our duchy."
 STW_root_out_archon_supporters:0 "The List"
 STW_root_out_archon_supporters_desc:0 "Within our nation, there are griffons who feel a greater sense of devotion towards their temple than their Duchess. These griffons are a threat to our sovereignty, a fifth column which will attempt to dethrone us in the face of the [STW.GetGRIFascistLeaderName]. As such, we must use our newly empowered royal guard to root out these zealots and remove them before they can become a threat."
 STW_a_grandiose_party:0 "A Grandiose Party"
 STW_a_grandiose_party_desc:0 "The nation has finally begun to warm to the return of the Duchess. However, her efforts have left the nobility of Strawberry largely ignored. As such, it is imperative that we remedy this slight before it is allowed to fester into anything serious. To do this, we will host a grand banquet in the royal palace with the entirety of Strawberry's upper crust invited to attend."
 STW_center_of_learning:0 "Expand the University of Readewetter"
 STW_center_of_learning_desc:0 "Facilities at the University of Readewetter are woefully underequipped for dealing with the potential influx of students the campus is likely to experience in coming years. With this in mind, we must expand this renowned facility, creating additional classrooms, hiring new professors, and pledging greater funds to the sciences."
 STW_strawberry_rules_archons_fucking_dead:0 "Gabriela's Regency"
 STW_strawberry_rules_archons_fucking_dead_desc:0 "With the fall of the [STW.GetGRIFascistLeaderName], Gabriela Eagleclaw has seized her rightful claim to the regency of Grover VI. This will usher in a bright new future for the Griffon Empire, as her fair and just leadership will help modernize it, while pacifying and moderating relations abroad. Truly, this marks the beginning of a new era for all griffons."

 STW_industry_start_desc:0 "Industrialization has been slow to reach Griffonia, with our own nation only experiencing the first vestiges. However, our lands are rich in coal, iron, and oil, and to properly exploit this we must invest in a new era of heavy manufacturing that will make us the pride of the Empire."
 # Loyalist/Eagleclaw
 STW_move_to_the_city:0 "Develop Readewetter"
 STW_move_to_the_city_desc:0 "Our capital is the thriving heart of the Strawberry Duchy, housing the majority of our industrial development. However, there is room to expand and turn the city into a crowning industrial jewel for the Empire. However, such a dream will not come cheap and will require much investment on our behalf."
 STW_support_big_business:0 "Subsidize Domestic Industries"
 STW_support_big_business_desc:0 "We offer land and a skilled workforce, however industrial investment has been slow to trickle in, making our dreamed industrialization a slow crawl. However, our administration has begun a bold plan of tax reform and subsidies, helping to prop up domestic firms, which might just need a little extra help to compete on the world stage."
 STW_money_for_the_nobles:0 "Sell Ducal Lands"
 STW_money_for_the_nobles_desc:0 "Large swathes of rural land remain under the Duchy's jurisdiction, generating a meagre profit in terms of rent and agricultural surplus. By selling these lands to interested nobles, we can generate significant revenues which can then be invested into Readewetter, offering a far more lucrative business opportunity for our administration."
 STW_privatisation_railway:0 "All Roads Lead to Readewetter"
 STW_privatisation_railway_desc:0 "The vast resources of the countryside struggle to reach Readewetter, denying our mills, factories, and enterprises the wealth of our nation. By working in tandem with private firms, we can ensure that the infrastructure needed to tap into these vast resources is developed, allowing for the cheaper flow of goods into our capital and heart of the economy."
 STW_start_resource_projects:0 "Eastern Investment"
 STW_start_resource_projects_desc:0 "Our three eastern provinces are rich in natural resources. However, our infrastructure and investment in this region is rather lackluster, meaning that the mines and oilfields of the east are running at only a fraction of their potential capacity. By investing in this region, we can ensure a greater quantity of industrial resources to fuel the rapidly growing demand within Readewetter."
 STW_military_industrial_complex:0 "The Military-Industrial Complex"
 STW_military_industrial_complex_desc:0 "In modern war we can not rely upon a few government firms to provide the equipment of our military in prolonged engagements. Instead, we must call upon our civilian sector to come to our aid, providing their industrial assets to the nation, allowing us to produce guns, bullets, tanks, and planes at a rate that would've been unimaginable even a decade earlier."
 STW_electronics_focus:0 "The Era of Electronics"
 STW_electronics_focus_desc:0 "The radio has revolutionized mass communication, allowing for a message to be carried to thousands of griffons simultaneously. For years, we have imported foreign radios into our nation, creating a reliance upon manufacturers in Griffenheim. To break this dependency, our firms must adopt the mission of developing, designing, and producing our own domestic variant."
 STW_create_new_industrial_parks:0 "A New Readewetter"
 STW_create_new_industrial_parks_desc:0 "Readewetter has become the crowning jewel of industrialization that our nation needed. However, the city is taped with further development becoming an increasingly costly endeavour. However, the other cities of the Duchy are chomping at the bit to witness a similar change in their fortune. What city will become the next Readewetter?"
 STW_invite_magical_one_horns:0 "Import Equestrian Expertise"
 STW_invite_magical_one_horns_desc:0 "Equestria has thrived through its industrial revolution, offering a shining example of the wonders to come to our great nation. Along with this example, they have also trained and given experience to a wide range of economists, engineers, technicians, and managers. By importing this talent into our nation, we can ensure that we don't have to 'reinvent the wheel' with our industrialization."
 STW_encourage_construction:0 "Construction Boom"
 STW_encourage_construction_desc:0 "The growth of Readewetter, in recent years, has sponsored a wave of construction, which has employed and trained thousands of griffons in the field. Their expertise has proven vital in aiding the rapid development of our capital and outlying regions."
 #Commie/Fash
 STW_support_the_farms:0 "Modernize Agriculture"
 STW_support_the_farms_desc:0 "The countryside of the Duchy has long been neglected, left in the claws of a semi-feudal system of large-scale noble estate exploiting unlanded poor. Not only is this system inefficient at producing food but it also locks a large pool of potential labour within the fields of the Duchy. By investing in modern agricultural techniques, we can begin to do away with this system and modernize."
 STW_workers_rights:0 "The Ministry of Labour"
 STW_workers_rights_desc:0 "Industrialized economies have a delicate balancing act to follow, where the interests of craftgriffs must be weighed against the profits of investors. By creating a dedicated Ministry of Labour, we can appoint a minister to oversee labour relations and ensure that labour disruptions and worker abuses are kept to an absolute minimum."
 STW_7_hour_workday:0 "The 8 Hour Workday"
 STW_7_hour_workday_desc:0 "'8 hours of work, 8 hours of rest, and 8 hours of leisure' has been a rallying call amongst our urban workforce for awhile now, fostering a rather vocal interest in the subject. By passing a law, mandating this practice, we will assuredly win favour from the working populace within our cities."
 STW_seize_noble_lands:0 "Breakup Noble Estates"
 STW_seize_noble_lands_desc:0 "While investments in modernizing agriculture have made some inroads in addressing the social issues of the countryside, the lingering structures left by the previous semi-feudal system still linger. As such, we must begin to acquire noble estates and begin the process of breaking them apart and dolling them out to the populace, ensuring that they are managed far more effectively."
 STW_expand_mines:0 "Exploit our Mineral Wealth"
 STW_expand_mines_desc:0 "The great mines of Drawftail and Starclaw are prosperous to our populace. However, they are operated at only a fraction of their potential capacity. By expanding our operations, we can drastically increase our supply of iron, coal, and other strategically vital assets."
 STW_drill_for_oil:0 "Exploit Osnabeak"
 STW_drill_for_oil_desc:0 "The great plains of Osnabeak are marked by rows of oil derricks, pumping crude and natural gas out of the ground. However, the region still has a vast reserve of resources just waiting to be exploited. By investing in additional infrastructure and equipment, we can vastly increase our supply and help meet imperial demands for generations."
 STW_nationalize_rail:0 "Connect the Countryside"
 STW_nationalize_rail_desc:0 "Outside of Readewetter, our nation is connected by a series of fragile rail lines, poorly paved roads, and dirt paths. This severely limits our economy, making the transportation of goods a dangerous, difficult, and costly endeavour. By investing in upgrades to our infrastructure network, we can increase the connectivity of the countryside to Readewetter, greatly benefiting our economy."
 STW_more_guns:0 "Decentralize the Arms Industry"
 STW_more_guns_desc:0 "Growing connectivity to the countryside has allowed us to move industry outside of the city of Readewetter. By doing this, we can decentralize our arms industry, ensuring that our war effort would be allowed to endure even if our capital was to be bombed or captured by hostile factions. While less efficient, it's a safety net we'll greatly benefit from in the event of war."
 STW_investagation_electronics:0 "Readewetter I"
 STW_investagation_electronics_desc:0 "Electrical Engineers at the University of Readewetter have designed a machine which can complete basic arithmetic. Dubbed Readewetter, this initial machine might seem rather simplistic, but the designers promise, that with proper funding, such a device could prove to be the future of mathematics, performing calculations beyond what mere griffons could ever hope to achieve."
 STW_large_scale_construction:0 "Taming Nature"
 STW_large_scale_construction_desc:0 "Raging rivers and rugged mountains, these issues plague development within our Duchy. However, with our pool of labour growing, we can begin an extensive public works project to bring nature to heel, controlling our vast rivers and harsh landscape so that it may benefit our griffons in the future."
 
  ### Military
 STW_military_shit:0 "Memory of Rotten Rift"
 STW_military_shit_desc:0 "A decade ago, forces of the Imperial and Strawberry armies coordinated a raid on republican assets in the region of Rotten Rift. The attack ended in disaster, with our combined forces being routed and driven back into Feathisia. While a humiliation, this assault provided some much-needed lessons in modern warfare to our army."
 STW_modern_military:0 "The Army of the 11th Century"
 STW_modern_military_desc:0 "Our infantry uses breach loaded rifles, our artillery corps is antiquated, and motorization is almost non-existent. If we hope to stand talon to talon with the cream of the imperial crop, we must modernize our forces and verse them in the realities of modern war."
 STW_support_divisions:0 "The Strawberry Corps of Engineers"
 STW_support_divisions_desc:0 "Engineers will play a critical role in the upcoming war, fulfilling many roles. They are the repairers of combat vehicles, the destroyers of fortified strongpoints, the designers of trenches, and the builders of bridges. With this in mind its about time that we created a dedicate branch of the military to train and facilitate their needs."
 STW_big_guns:0 "Modernize the Artillery Corps"
 STW_big_guns_desc:0 "Over the last century, the role of artillery has become increasingly important within war. Without it, a modern army can not advance lest they take horrifying causalities. As such, we must ensure that Strawberry does not lag behind in either artillery production or technological innovation."
 STW_griff_tech:0 "Revolutionize the Griffon"
 STW_griff_tech_desc:0 "Griffons are predators with claws and beaks that could cut through flesh and bone. There is much combat efficiency to be gained if we could harness this predatory force and weaponize the very natural advantages bestowed upon us."
 STW_new_guns_n_shit:0 "Modern Small Arms"
 STW_new_guns_n_shit_desc:0 "In the event of war our army will need every advantage it can get its talons on. A cheap means of achieving this is by ensuring that our riflegriffs are equipped with the most modern and lethal of small arms."
 STW_radar:0 "An Equestrian Revolution"
 STW_radar_desc:0 "RADAR is an Equestrian technology which allows them to detect airborne threats from hundreds of kilometers away, giving them plenty of time to scramble an intercepting force and protect their airspace. It would be very beneficial for us to get our talons on this technology."
 #Commie/Fash
 STW_more_bodies_is_good:0 "Irontalon Doctrine"
 STW_more_bodies_is_good_desc:0 "Jillian Irontalon is the chief proponent of what has been dubbed the realists doctrine of warfare. She acknowledges that Strawberry's industrial capabilities are lacking and as such we will be unable to facilitate total war. With this in mind, she wants to focus her military upon infantry, which she views as less of a burden upon our arms industry and logistics."
 STW_fresh_feathers:0 "Ducal Draft"
 STW_fresh_feathers_desc:0 "It's been decades since the duchy has initiated a draft. However, as the threat of war within the empire looms, it has become apparent that our military is too small, in its current state, to handle the might of the imperial war machine. As such, we must call upon every able-bodied griffons within our nation to come to its aid."
 STW_even_more_guns:0 "Standardize the Rifle"
 STW_even_more_guns_desc:0 "Currently, our military is employing a wide range of weaponry. This has created a huge supply issue, as all manner of calibres are required to keep our forces in peak condition. In order to address this, we must select a single model of rifle and make it standard issue for all Strawberry forces, hopefully addressing this problem."
 STW_light_tanks:0 "Tankettes"
 STW_light_tanks_desc:0 "We are not ignorant to the advances of modern warfare and acknowledge the need for mechanized and armoured forces. However, with our poor industrial base, which should focus upon less resource intensive models, using these primarily as infantry support vehicles and within rapid response units."
 STW_some_towed_arty:0 "The New Role of Artillery"
 STW_some_towed_arty_desc:0 "The increasing efficiency of small arms has greatly enhanced the defensibility and killing potential of even modest infantry formations. In response, our military must focus upon the inclusion of a greater concentration of artillery into its formations to break up and neutralize these potential threats."
 STW_defences_against_everyone_who_isnt_the_empire:0 "Remember an Old Threat"
 STW_defences_against_everyone_who_isnt_the_empire_desc:0 "The Griffon Republic stands to our Northwest. While they have been mostly silent since their fall, they are still a threat to the security of Strawberry and the Empire. So even as civil conflict within the Empire looks increasingly likely, we must fortify and secure this hostile border."
 STW_defences_against_the_empire:0 "The Osnabeak Line"
 STW_defences_against_the_empire_desc:0 "The thought of internal imperial defenses was foreign until mere months ago. Now as the threat of an intra-imperial war looks increasingly likely, we must ensure that our southern border is secured against the threat of imperial intervention."
 STW_more_guns_is_good:0 "Eagleclaw Doctrine"
 STW_more_guns_is_good_desc:0 "Gene Eagleclaw is a cousin of the Duchess and main proponent of what has been dubbed the idealist doctrine of warfare. While he admits that Strawberry's industrial base is lacking, he predicts that with his cousin's reforms the nation will soon be able to facilitate modern war. With this in mind, he wishes to focus upon well equipped and highly mobile task forces at the core of our military."
 #Loyalist/Eagleclaw
 STW_better_guns_is_good:0 "Invest in a New Infantry Rifle"
 STW_better_guns_is_good_desc:0 "While the number of griffons killed by small arms is tiny compared to those taken out by artillery, we should not underestimate the importance of such weapons. By investing in a new generation of small arms, we could have a very potent edge upon our enemies, allowing us to dominate the battlefield."
 STW_support_weapons:0 "Non-Combatant Roles"
 STW_support_weapons_desc:0 "The growing complexity of modern warfare has spawned a whole generation of military personal who will likely never see combat. These include engineers, medics, truck drivers, radio operators, and mechanics. While their duties take them away from the battlefield their role is no less important than that of the riflegriff."
 STW_medium_tanks:0 "The Eagleclaw"
 STW_medium_tanks_desc:0 "Armoured combat will play a critical role in modern war, acting as the spearhead of mobile armies. They are vital in breaking through hostile defenses and allowing for the infantry to pour through the breach and invade enemy territory. With this in mind, we need to invest into a modern tank to fulfill such a role."
 STW_special_forces:0 "Expand the Special Forces"
 STW_special_forces_desc:0 "What we lack in raw numbers we can make up for with quality training and equipment. Amongst our many battalions we should set aside a small number and provide them with specialized training which will make them adapt at fighting within the rugged mountainous terrain of Strawberry."
 STW_modern_magical_arms:0 "Collaborate with Bronzehill"
 STW_modern_magical_arms_desc:0 "The mountains of Bronzehill are rich with crystal charged with magical energy. It has been theorized for a while now that this energy could be harvested for all sorts of purposes. Most important of which is that it could be used within new, energy-based, weaponry which would put traditional small arms to shame in terms of killing potential."
 
 ### Airforce
 STW_modernise_airfields:0 "Airport Construction Grants"
 STW_modernise_airfields_desc:0 "The prospect of air travel within Strawberry is nonexistent, leading to our nation lagging behind Griffonia in this regard. By subsidizing the duchy's various large towns, we can begin a programme of aerial infrastructure development. In the event of war these sites could be used as bases for the burgeoning Strawberry Air Force"
 STW_hire_new_officers:0 "Contract Foreign Advisors"
 STW_hire_new_officers_desc:0 "While aerial combat is not cutting-edge territory for griffonkind, what is new is the use of airplanes in conducting it. Thankfully, other nations have been dealing with this for decades now and a pool of potential advisors is available for us to hire."
 STW_refresh_doctrine:0 "Develop Doctrine"
 STW_refresh_doctrine_desc:0 "Like any other branch of the armed forces, the physical griffons and their equipment are only half the battle in conducting successful operations. As such, we must begin to draft a doctrine for our air force, allowing us a set of tactics and strategic plans in the events of actual combat."
 STW_anti_planes_planes_focus:0 "Defend Readewetter"
 STW_anti_planes_planes_focus_desc:0 "In the event of war, it is likely that the imperial army will deploy its own air force to strike at Strawberry's army and civilian centres. As such, we must stand ready to deploy our own air force to defend such sites from bombing."
 STW_bomb_it_to_shit_focus:0 "Attack Griffenheim"
 STW_bomb_it_to_shit_focus_desc:0 "In the event of war, our army will likely find itself on the defensive against the vast land forces of the imperial army. However, the development of long-range bombing aircraft could provide a lucrative means of assaulting Griffenheim and other imperial centres."
 STW_plane_developement:0 "Death from Above"
 STW_plane_developement_desc:0 "The concept of terror bombing still gives many within our high command cold talons. Yet, as the reality of modern war becomes ever more apparent, the civilian populace of hostile nations has been proven to be an effective asset for the production of war materials.  We must deny the enemy such an asset."
 STW_anti_planes_bullets:0 "The Air Force Volunteer Corps"
 STW_anti_planes_bullets_desc:0 "Across the nation, our government is installing hundreds of anti-air guns which will protect our cities and industrial parks from the threat of aerial bombardment. However, it is up to our civilian populace to heed the call and join in the Air Force Volunteer Corps, manning these guns when the alarm bells chime."
 STW_close_air_support:0 "Aerial Assault"
 STW_close_air_support_desc:0 "The development of a new class of aircraft which are small, nimble, and equipped with cannons and light bombs would be highly beneficial. These would be able to disrupt enemy combat formations and provide a reliable means of assaulting strongpoints and armour. "
 STW_more_fields:0 "Upgrade Air Fields"
 STW_more_fields_desc:0 "While the airfield grants were effective in producing rudimentary facilities, there is still much work to be done into modernizing these sites. Runways need to be paved, control towers manned and staffed, and modern maintenance and repair facilities put in place. With these upgrades, we can expect these sites to handle a far larger amount of aircraft."
 STW_more_planes:0 "Dominate the Skies"
 STW_more_planes_desc:0 "If our recent experiences have proven anything, it is that dominance in the skies is a must if we wish to wage a successful war against the empire. As such, we must mobilize our industrial base into building more fighters, bombers, and other aircraft to accomplish this ambitious task."
 STW_valschermtroepen:0 "Valschermptroepen"
 STW_valschermtroepen_desc:0 "Griffons have been gifted with a natural ability to fly, allowing us the means to paradrop forces safely behind enemy lines. If these units were given ample training, they could be a useful weapon in causing chaos behind enemy lines, tying up hostile forces, and capturing strategic sites as a prelude to an operation."
 STW_rakettekes:0 "Liquid Propellant Rockets"
 STW_rakettekes_desc:0 "Theorists in Feathisia have begun to develop a new generation of rockets which can travel considerable distances and hold payloads that might prove useful in war. By building upon this research we can hope to achieve even more outstanding results, providing our armed forces with another means of striking at our foes."

strawberry.1.d:0 "Dreadful news are coming to our beloved Duchy: Our dear emperor, Grover V, has passed away. After decades of service to his people, he now has gone to meet the gods, and we are left behind to grieve.\n\nYet even as the entire empire is in mourning, this shock has brought up another issue of a more local, but all the more pressing, concern. Our gracious duchess, Gabriela Eagleclaw, has already been away from Readewetter for nearly a year, and hers is still the ultimate authority in these lands. Yet she is going to be staying in Griffenheim for the foreseeable future, dealing with the fallout of her dear friend and Emperor's death. Thus, even as Strawberry is trembling with the news, her leader is nowhere to be found."
strawberry.1.a:0 "She will return in due time, I'm sure of it."

strawberry.2.t:0 "Our Duchess Returns!"
strawberry.2.d:0 "Across the duchy, all griffons would surely be overjoyed at the long overdue return of our beloved Duchess, had the situation not been so extreme. Arriving by high speed car, she ordered all of her closest ministers and vassals assembled right there and then without even changing out of her travel clothes.\n\nAs the confused and worried griffons were all ushered in into the throne room Gabriela barely gave them time to even say hello before she spoke up. While dusty from the road and with visible lines under her eyes, she still spoke briskly, moving around the room with poise and grace but at the same time with lightning in her eyes and anger in her voice.\n\n"My apologies for summoning you all so quickly, my dear friends, but there is no time to waste. I trust Regina has been keeping you abreast of events in the palace, yes?" she asked, giving her younger cousin a quick look that left Regina floundering.\n\n"I... I have..." Regina began before Gabriela cut her off.\n\n"Do not be coy, not now," she all but snapped before continuing. "I know you have informants there and would be disappointed if you didn't. You know what has happened, and I presume you have spread the news?" When Regina could only nod Gabriela took a deep breath before continuing.\n\n"I tried, the gods will know that I tried, but this time around, that old crow got the upper claw. He bribed the commoners and the army to his side... and now our rightful emperor is in Eros' claws. I don't know what comes next, but I know that he will not settle for this. He has a vision, and he will not stop before he has burned all that the empire is down to achieve it. Our history, our traditions and our legacy means nothing to this zealot, and unless we are content to watch them all burn, I fear this conflict is only going to escalate... maybe even to war.""
strawberry.2.a:0 "Boreas help us all..."

strawberry.3.t:0 "The Duchess Stays in the South!"
strawberry.3.d:0 "When the news arrived in Readewetter it would be wrong to say that people were surprised. Rather, a kind of weary resignation settled in as the court was informed that Duchess Gabriela would, for the foreseeable future, remain in Griffenheim as regent for the only four year old crown prince.\n\nWhile few were so audacious to actually criticize the Duchess for her choice, the fact that they were only becoming more and more distant from their respected liege was hard to miss. One noblegriff was heard muttering that he guessed they should be happy they had not received the news vis the rumor mill, and even less bitter voices wondered if they were meant to just do nothing until she deigned to return.\n\nWhatever the duchy's personal feelings on the matter are, however, it must now come together to deal with this situation. Without someone on the throne, the apparatus of state is nigh paralyzed, and a solution must be found posthaste."
strawberry.3.a:0 "Has she utterly forgotten us?"

strawberry.4.t:0 "The Regency Discussion"
strawberry.4.d:0 "With the duchess having more important matters than her own duchy to handle, it has been decided that a regency must be put in place instead. Thankfully, the Duchess sent us instructions on how to proceed, and already the list of candidates are narrowed down to three griffons.\n\nThe first one is the Prelate of Osnabeak and a distant uncle of the Duchess, Julius Eagleclaw. He has long been known as an unrelentingly firm traditionalist, and some have raised concerns about his longstanding contacts with the Boreaite Archon. All the same though, he is firm and disciplined, and maybe that is what the duchy needs?\n\nSecond is Vitalius Moonbill, a curious candidate who despite his relatively low standing has contacts everywhere, not the least among the common griffs, and seems to have a claw in every pie there is. Maybe his radical views is what is needed, even if some call them republicanism?\n\nLastly, the safest of the three options is the Duchess' younger cousin, Regina Eagleclaw, a savvy political player and faithful friend of the Duchess ever since their young days. She is committed to staying by her cousin's side and to the prosperity of the duchy in equal measure."
strawberry.4.a:0 "By the Gods, Julius Eagleclaw is our regent."
strawberry.4.b:0 "Vitalius has the people's trust."
strawberry.4.c:0 "Noble Regina shall lead our nation!"

strawberry.5.t:0 "The Spread of Literacy"
strawberry.5.d.fascism:0 "Employing a firm claw with the populace was the right way to go. The level of literacy is increasing steadily, and our people are becoming well-taught in matters of faith. While some complain about "being needed at the farm" or similar excuses, this is the way forward for the duchy."
strawberry.5.d.communism.bad:0 "While our strict rationing program has made sure that griffons go to school diligently, hungry griffs, as it turns out, makes for poor students. By our estimates, the tradeoff is worth it, but it is hampering progress somewhat."
strawberry.5.d.communism.good:0 "It has taken some investments, but the shortage of labour in the field has been more than compensated for with the sponsoring of agricultural machines for the peasantry. While there may be some time before we see a noticeable increase in production, the increase in literacy is progressing steadily."
strawberry.5.d.neutrality:0 "The Duchess has taken to the road to visit schools around the duchy. While her excursions are by nature brief, she has shown an enthusiasm for meeting the local children whether they are commoners or not. She listens patiently as they read, helps those who stumble and gives praise readily, with the children being left starry eyed and awed by the visits."
strawberry.5.d.democratic:0 "We have seen that the people want to read but that the realities of their situation sometimes can get in the way. Yet, thanks to our efforts to provide learning opportunities at home and to make the most of our people's talents have helped a lot. In due time, this will only strengthen our people."
strawberry.5.a:0 "Good news indeed!"

strawberry.6.t:0 "An Unexpected Challenge"
strawberry.6.d:0 "An unexpected issue has arisen in the countryside, where some of the farmers have been protesting the new literacy programs. A peasant elder from the region has used his legal right to address the court as a representative of the local village councils.\n\n"It is all well and good for you to read and write good sirs and ladies, but we are but simple griffs who tend the fields and the orchards. They need every claw we can muster, and wasting the days indoors to learn things we've managed without for centuries won't help us, it will weaken us. Please noble sirs and ladies, I pray that you will understand the concerns of our villages."\n\nAcknowledging the elder's words, the council must now deliberate on what to do. Aborting the programs are out of the question, but the peasants' complaint needs to be addressed somehow."  
strawberry.6.aa:0 "They will read or they will taste the lash."
strawberry.6.ba:0 "Make sure to have the religious libraries well-stocked."
strawberry.6.ab:0 "If they refuse to do their part, they will not eat."
strawberry.6.bb:0 "Help them with agricultural machines to speed things along."
strawberry.6.ac:0 "We understand their concern, send them books to read at home at least."
strawberry.6.bc:0 "Those who perform well should be sponsored for further studies."
strawberry.6.ad:0 "Hold speeches in each town on how important reading is!"
strawberry.6.bd:0 "Provide each home with tales of our noble house!"

strawberry.7.t:0 "Finalizing the Reforms"
strawberry.7.d:0 "Our efforts to improve the literacy amongst the populace has born the most fertile of fruit. Literacy is increasing rapidly, and by our estimates, soon the inability to read will be a thing of the past barring some minimal exceptions. We can truly congratulate ourselves on a job well done."
strawberry.7.a:0 "A job well done indeed!"
strawberry.7.b:0 "Let's make sure we use our people's newfound skill!"
strawberry.7.c:0 "We need to get this done right now!"

strawberry.8.t:0 "Cooperation with Feathisia"
strawberry.8.d:0 "Feathisia has always had a close bond with our duchy, even when disregarding the contemporary rumors regarding Duchess Gabriela and Grand Duke Gerlach. Considering this, the level of cooperation between our two regions has been surprisingly lacking in recent times. There are excuses of course, the Duchess was bound in Griffenheim and the Grand Duke has accepted being  a figurehead in Feathisian politics.\n\nWith a new regent on the throne, however, it is time to start reconsidering this. Feathisia possesses a strong industry and a world-spanning trade network, with a large portion of our foreign trade already going through Rottendedam. It is time for us to contact the Grand Duke and the Feathisian Parliament to attempt to increase cooperation."
strawberry.8.a:0 "They will surely be open to the idea"
strawberry.8.b:0 "We should offer them the trade deal of a century!"

strawberry.9.t:0 "A Deal with the Strawberry Duchy?"
strawberry.9.d:0 "As Duchess Gabriela has been preoccupied in Griffenheim with the Regency, there is now a new regent in her old domain. The new ruler of the Strawberry Duchy has sent us an offer to increase the trade between our two nations. The deal is a quite moderate one, and it will take some investment on our part, but the ministry offinance ensures us that it will be worth it in the long run."
strawberry.9.a:0 "Alas, we cannot accept right now."
strawberry.9.b:0 "Agreed!"

strawberry.10.t:0 "Strengthening Our Bonds with the Strawberry Duchy?"
strawberry.10.d:0 "As Duchess Gabriela has been preoccupied in Griffenheim with the Regency, there is now a new regent in her old domain. The new ruler of the Strawberry Duchy has sent us an offer to increase the trade between our two nations in a quite ambitious way. The ministry of finance's predictions are quite pleasing, and the main question is going to be how much we are willing to invest."
strawberry.10.a:0 "Let's give our neighbors what they came for."
strawberry.10.b:0 "This is going to benefit our nations greatly!"

strawberry.11.t:0 "The Feathisian Response"
strawberry.11.d:0 "Our offer has been accepted by the Feathisian government and we are beginning to loosen the trade restrictions that still exist. Already there has been economic activity in the area, and from what we understand several companies are rushing in to make the most of the opportunity presented."
strawberry.11.a:0 "Great news!"
strawberry.11.b:0 "Fantastic news!"

strawberry.12.t:0 "Sad News"
strawberry.12.d:0 "Sadly, the Feathisians rejected our offer of economic cooperation. Citing uncertainties about the long term benefits of the deal, they regret to inform us that they cannot accept the deal as it is currently offered."
strawberry.12.a:0 "Disappointing..."

strawberry.13.t:0 "Rally to the Duchess' Side"
strawberry.13.d:0 "The Duchess is fighting on the behalf of the entire empire in Griffenheim and while many felt disappointed that she did not return, neither she nor the empire need petulant children or selfish schemers right now. Rather, we must prove ourselves loyal citizens and servants of the crown in a time where there's all too few of those. Fortunately we have just the way to achieve this. Griffenheim and the Strawberry Duchy together has the industry and the resources to be of immense service to the throne, and a proposal has been drafted up where the Duchess will be informed that we are prepared to coordinate with the imperial industries for greater efficiency. We are sure that in these times more than ever Gabriela will make sure to reward service, she always has after all.\n\nVoices has been raised against this though, asking if we truly should be so meek, and whether we should count less on her famed charity and instead make a deal between nobles."
strawberry.13.a:0 "We are her faithful servants."
strawberry.13.b:0 "We will demand reciprocity!"

strawberry.14.t:0 "The Loyal Duchy"
strawberry.14.d1:0 "Gabriela kept a perfectly dignified face while listening to the news from the Strawberry Duchy, even as she felt like she wanted to smile like a fool. She could not deny that with all that had happened she had been neglectful towards her realm, and yet the news from Readewetter had brought her pride and joy of a kind that was a rare treat even for the finest of leaders.\n\nThe Strawberry Duchy had just informed Griffenheim that they were preparing to send a huge delivery of industrial equipment to help build up the empire's industrial capacity. As if they were aiming to play on her romantic streak, her dear, neglected duchy had even addressed the official message to "our beloved Duchess, now and forever."\n\nContemplating the message, Gabriela had to consider what to do with it. She was still their rightful Duchess, and indeed this was not that much more than what was expected in a way. And yet, had politics rendered her so heartless? She was a neglectful Duchess, duty or not, and maybe she should make sure that the Empire rewarded these diligent subjects? Indeed... maybe she could even make sure that they were not just recognized, but that she paid her subjects back for her long absence?"
strawberry.14.d2:0 "The thing about duty was that it rarely was the simplest of roads to go down. It pushed and pulled at you, demanding ever more, no matter what you felt about it personally. Either you obeyed and sacrificed, or you would fail.\n\nGabriela knew that down to her very core. Duty had taken from her all her life. She had sacrificed during the republican uprising, losing dear friends rather than abandoning the throne. She had sacrificed the marriage to the love of her life. Her cousin, weak on the throne, couldn't allow such a powerful political bloc when he sat so week on the throne, and thus she had been forced to turn down Gerlach even as her heart cried for her to accept his proposal. And now it seemed she had sacrificed her duchy's faith in her as well.\n\nThe message to her was cold and impersonal, an attempt to lobby for mutual industrial aid to the crown from one of its vassals, not a gift from her subjects.She did not blame them, all must play the political game, but all the same it stung to see how far she had fallen in their eyes. She was a regent only to them where once she had been their Duchess. Just another thing she sacrificed for duty, it seemed."
strawberry.14.a:0 "Thank you for your service."
strawberry.14.b:0 "You give willingly, you shall receive too."
strawberry.14.c:0 "I have neglected you, and I should reward your patience."
strawberry.14.e:0 "Let them know Griffenheim accepts their proposal."

strawberry.15.t:0 "The Strawberry Duchy Sends Equipment"
strawberry.15.d:0 "As the Strawberry Duchy promised, a large shipment of goods has arrived to strengthen the Empire's industrial capacity. The equipment is already being installed across our factories and within a few days our industry should start performing even better than before. The empire will surely triumph with such dedicated subjects."
strawberry.15.a:0 "We are most grateful."

strawberry.16.nothing.t:0 ""Duty is its own Reward""
strawberry.16.nothing.d:0 "Our delivery of industrial equipment to the Empire has been sent, and from the reports it has been most welcome both in the press and from the court. An official press release in the local papers has praised out action, and we are held up as exemplary subjects to the crown. Beyond praise though, our reward for the effort put in is a job well done, it seems. Maybe we were naive to imagine Gabriela would divert efforts to us..."
strawberry.16.nothing.a:0 "We did our duty, that's what matters..."

strawberry.16.firststep.t:0 "The Duchess Remembers Us"
strawberry.16.firststep.d:0 "Our delivery of industrial equipment is being transported south, and we have done our duty to the Duchess. The pessimists said we were being naive, but the response from Griffenheim has proved them wrong, thoroughly. Gabriela has lobbied for our efforts to be recognized, stating that in these times loyalty and duty must be rewarded. There were, from what we understand, some controversy surrounding it but she came through for us, and the imperial administration is currently coordinating with us to help boost our economy as well."
strawberry.16.firststep.a:0 "Still our Duchess."
strawberry.16.firststep.b:0 "Our Duchess, now and forever."

strawberry.16.mutual.t:0 "Earning our Respect"
strawberry.16.mutual.d:0 "The deal we proposed to Griffenheim has been accepted, and preparations are underway for the industrial exchange between our two states. From what we've understood, it seemed that the regent was somewhat disappointed with us taking such a firm stance about reciprocity, but thankfully they accepted it without much issue. It was, after all, a quite fair deal, and the time for goodwill has passed. Strawberry must be able to fly by its own wings, and thankfully our absent Duchess is still a shrewd enough businessgriff to recognize a good deal, even if she might have hoped for more."
strawberry.16.mutual.a:0 "It's just business."
strawberry.16.mutual.b:0 "It's just business."

strawberry.17.t:0 "Strawberry Shall Prosper"
strawberry.17.d:0 "If we are to build our duchy up, we must strengthen our industrial base first of all. For this, we will need revenue, and there are several possible ideas that have arisen regarding how to increase this revenue.\n\nThe first and most obvious solution is to implement some temporary tariffs on certain goods, mostly luxury items and the likes. This will not disturb the economy too much and while it may annoy some people, it is well within our rights.\n\nAnother, more controversial, option is to revise the tax exemptions around the duchy. The temples, especially, possesses great wealth that by ancient custom has been off limits to tax collectors. In times like these, maybe it's time to reconsider this?\n\nThe third option is regarding the Duchess' personal estates. Thanks to a technicality in the law, we can consider most of her property across the Strawberry Duchy forfeit as she is no longer acting as Duchess. It would no doubt anger her, but it would be a huge boon for us.\n\nLastly there is the option of considering more suspect methods. A few well-placed threats and implications could "convince" the local nobility to give up some of their property to aid us. Needless to say, this last option would need to be handled quietly."
strawberry.17.a:0 "The tariffs are the safe bet."
strawberry.17.b:0 "The temples have no need of tax exemptions."
strawberry.17.c:0 "Seize some of the private estates."
strawberry.17.e:0 "Let's "encourage" donations from the wealthy."

strawberry.18.t:0 "The Incompetent Duchess"
strawberry.18.d:0 "Gabriela has been absent from the duchy for years at this point, and with a new ruler appointed to the regency a blunt question has been raised: should the Strawberry Duchy still support her so blindly?\n\nDisregarding her service to the Empire by and large, she has brought little to the duchy but stagnation and neglect. By any reasonably metric, she has been an incompetent Duchess.\n\nThe games that Gabriela is playing in the south aren't games that benefits the Strawberry Duchy in any way, and maybe it is time to look at things soberly. There is, after all, profit to be made in turning to the other side as well."
strawberry.18.a:0 "We should prepare to join the Archon."
strawberry.18.b:0 "We are still her loyal subjects."
strawberry.18.c:0 "We would join the Archon, but we are not traitors."

strawberry.19.t:0 "Secret Talks"
strawberry.19.d:0 "We are preparing to officially join the Archon's cause, but there are still many nobles loyal to Gabriela across the Strawberry Duchy. These could spoil our efforts in countless different ways, from trying to coup us to simply alerting Griffenheim. We must decide what we are going to do to do about them, and proposals range from rooting out and "disappearing" those who are an active threat to us to using political pressure and propaganda to convince them of the righteousness of our cause. Alternatively, maybe the best option is to not stir up too much conflict and attempt to slip under the radar. If we do not escalate, maybe they won't either?"
strawberry.19.a:0 "Root out the dissidents!"
strawberry.19.b:0 "Sway them to our side."
strawberry.19.c:0 "We will be fine, surely."

strawberry.20.t:0 "Rise to the Archon's Call"
strawberry.20.d:0 "Today we throw off the shackles of the incompetent duchess who expected us to serve her blindly even as she failed in every last duty she had towards Strawberry and its people. Strawberry will no longer be her backyard which she may deign to visit occasionally, but instead an independent state under the Gods and in service to the Archon.\n\nOur struggle has only just begun, but we have built ourselves up as a faithful and strong nation, not cowed by absent nobility but standing tall in faith and honor. Rise, oh Duchy, rise!"
strawberry.20.a:0 "We crushed them."
strawberry.20.b:0 "They were convinced in the end."
strawberry.20.c:0 "I told you it would work out."

strawberry.21.t:0 "The Terrible Realization"
strawberry.21.d:0 "Everything had been chaos in the last few hours. The news out of Griffenheim had left everyone reeling, barely able to process what they had heard. A coup, the palace had fallen, the military had taken control. It all was so far from what they had expected that it had left many griffs paralyzed with indecision.\n\nHad it not been for the Duchess, who had arrived back in Readewetter by plane a few hours ago and set about all but whipping everygriff into action, there was no telling what would have happened. As it was right now though, everygriff was running back and forth, gathering information, contacting old allies or simply getting the affairs of the Duchy in order as Gabriela sat in her room, staring at the wall as she slowly processed everything.\n\nShe had been almost on autopilot when arriving at home, acting on instinct and anger more than active thought. She had barely even processed all that had happened. She couldn't really process it, it was too horrible to imagine. She had feared the Archon, not this crazed junta that now sat in Griffenheim, that had shattered everything, that had...\n\nLittle Grover, a four year old child. A boy as sweet as Equestrian candy, shy and yet trusting of everyone. A boy with eyes that shone up so brightly at so many things and who could make her facade crack so easily with his pure spirit...\n\nSlowly, like poison spreading through her body, Gabriela felt the realization sink in, even as her heart wanted to scream and deny it. She swallowed heavily, feeling how her eyes suddenly welled over. The grief came without warning and without relenting, washing over her and leaving her burying her face in her claws, sobbing."
strawberry.21.a:0 "I will kill you for this Ferdinand... by the gods I swear that you will pay!"

strawberry.22.t:0 "Gathering Arms"
strawberry.22.d:0 "As the Duchess rallies her forces to contest the [STW.GetGRIFascistLeaderName], one massive issue is the disparity in military industry. The Strawberry Duchy never was a huge industrial powerhouse, and the nobility's strong hold on the region has limited the ability for the duchy to produce weapons at the quantities that the imperial armories can. This presents an issue, a pressing one, and while the Duchess cannot make factories spring up overnight, there are others ways that the duchy  can build up its military. There is, however, large stockpiles of weapons around the duchy - ranging from imperial armories to private collections - and if Strawberry's military is to be built up swiftly, this is the fasted option to gain it in a situation where slower options may well not be available."
strawberry.22.a:0 "Start courting donations and trade-ins for weapons."
strawberry.22.b:0 "Prepare to secretly raid imperial stockpiles."
strawberry.22.c:0 "Seize all privately owned weapons in the Duchy!"

strawberry.23.t:0 "Aligning the Nobility"
strawberry.23.d:0 "If one was given to romantic idealism, one would perhaps imagine that the nobility would come hurrying to Gabriela's side, much like how they did during the revolution. Alas, things were not so simple, nor had they been back then. Nobles were, by necessity, an ambitious sort, and the game of politics was an eternal affair.\n\nWhile Gabriela knew that the [STW.GetGRIFascistLeaderName] would cause a stir among the nobility, she was not presuming that that would be enough on its own. If she wanted to sway the nobility to her side, a canny politician would have to make it worth their while as well. She did not expect the people to follow her only for duty's sake, not if they had a chance to provide for their families by playing their cards right.\n\nThe question was just how generous she could be with those who came to her side."
strawberry.23.a:0 "I must trust that they see what is right for the empire."
strawberry.23.b:0 "They will be guaranteed tax breaks."
strawberry.23.c:0 "I will make sure they are allowed to expand their estates."

strawberry.24.t:0 "Aligning the Commoners"
strawberry.24.d:0 "The common griff was the foundation of the nation, Gabriela knew this well. He was the one who works the fields and in the factories to form the base upon which the great tower of society stood. Gabriela knew that - in one way - the revolution had come about because the nobility had forgotten just how important this foundation was. The commoners needed hope and pride, not just taxes and duty. and with the charismatic Eros against her, there would be a lot of commoners who would rally to the other side.\n\nThey weren't interested in family standing though, nor were they typically looking for political favors. No, for the average worker or peasant, money mattered. A chance to run their business mattered. Relief from taxes and starvation mattered.\n\nMerely speaking of duty and loyalty would only get her so far, she needed to truly give them a reason to come to her."
strawberry.24.a:0 "I must trust that they see what is right for the empire."
strawberry.24.b:0 "The taxes ARE quite slanted against them..."
strawberry.24.c:0 "Redistributing land from certain nobles to the commoners will do it."

strawberry.25.t:0 "Slanders on the [STW.GetGRIFascistLeaderName]"
strawberry.25.d:0 "The papers are circulating a new story today: apparently Duchess Gabriela Eagleclaw has taken it upon herself to share several stories of her time in the Imperial Court with a number of radio hosts and journalists. \n\nThe stories cover a range of subjects and tones, but most significant of all is her description of the [STW.GetGRIFascistLeaderName]. She depicts him as cold and callous, constantly scheming behind a thin veneer of holy kindness as he plots to burn the Griffonian Empire to the ground. Worse still, she makes him out to be an incompetent buffoon, tripping over himself in his attempts to manipulate those around him with convoluted plans that always backfire. \n\nOf course those loyal to the [STW.GetGRIFascistLeaderName] know that this is little more than childish slander, but the damage to his reputation is undeniable. We cannot let this treachery go unpunished!"
strawberry.25.a:0 "Lies."

strawberry.26.t:0 "Successful Sabotage"
strawberry.26.d:0 "A team of highly trained saboteurs slipped undetected into the Griffonain Empire last month. After weeks without contact, we have finally recieved word: the mission was a resounding success! They were able to plant a trio of timed bombs in the sewers beneath the factory, stealing away in the dead of night hours before the blast. The papers in Griffenheim are all shouting for the perpetrators to be found and brought to justice; even if anygriff suspects us, there's no proof of our involvement."
strawberry.26.a:0 "Good work."

strawberry.27.t:0 "Successful Sabotage"
strawberry.27.d:0 "A team of highly trained saboteurs slipped undetected into the Griffonian Empire last month. After weeks without contact, we have finally received word: the factory is critically damaged, but one of our infiltrators was caught. The team managed to rescue him before escaping, but it was too late; we've been found out. The papers across Griffenheim all call for the same thing: vengeance against the Strawberry Duchy."
strawberry.27.a:0 "Could be better."

strawberry.28.t:0 "Failed Sabotage"
strawberry.28.d:0 "A team of highly trained saboteurs slipped undetected into the Griffonian Empire last month. After weeks without contact, the newspapers in Griffenheim have all begun circulating a story of foreign spies being caught attempting to destroy a factory. We have received no word from our team. We can only assume that they were all caught in the act, and it's only a matter of time before our involvement is discovered."
strawberry.28.a:0 "We knew the risks."

strawberry.29.t:0 "The Duchess' Speech" 
strawberry.29.d:0 "It was late in the evening when Duchess Gabriela rushed into the Readewetter radio station, flanked on either side by the griffons of her council. The sun was still setting, and all around the Duchy she knew that her griffons would be settling into their cushioned seats with hot meals, cigars, or torn clothes in need of mending. Many of them would have radios perched atop their hearths or their tables, ready to share the results of games of sport or the exciting events of the latest radio drama. That day, however, there was something much more important that needed to be heard. \n\nThe station crew were surprised at first, stunned speechless by her unexpected arrival, but it didn't take long for Gabriela to make her intents clear. She ushered the radiogriffs away with patience and smiles, her words given weight by the quiet urgency simmering under the surface, and soon she was seated before the microphone. The radio host beside her cleared his throat, and a small red light flicked on, indicating that their words were now being broadcast live across the country.\n\n"Good evening, listeners," he said, voice smooth and calm despite the nervous glances he shot towards the Duchess. "We apologize for the late broadcast, and regret to inform you that your regular programming is being postponed. We have with us today none other than Duchess Eagleclaw herself. She would like to talk to you all." \n\nHe leaned back, looking to Gabriela and pointing a talon at her mic. "You're on," he mouthed. \n\nWith a deep breath, Gabriela leaned in."
strawberry.29.a:0 "Dear griffons of Strawberry..."

strawberry.30.t:0 "Listen To Me"
strawberry.30.d:0 ""Dear griffons of Strawberry, gather close around your radios and listen to me. I know I've been absent this past year, and perhaps you may feel you owe me nothing in the wake of my neglect. But I come to you pleading forgiveness, not for my sake, but for the sake of our beautiful empire, for the sake of your cousins in Bronzehill and Feathisia, for the sake of your daughters studying in Romau and your sons working to support their families. For the sake of peace, I ask that you listen."\n\n"You all no doubt have heard of the tragic death of my dear friend and cousin, Emperor Grover V, and of the regency installed to rule in young Grover VI's stead until he comes of age. He is young and naive, and I put everything I had into earning my own place on the Council of Regents, not for power's sake, but to ensure that the young Grover would grow into a noble ruler who would guide our people into a bright future."\n\n"But I failed. The [STW.GetGRIFascistLeaderName] has instead taken control, and I shudder to think of what he might do with this power. Know this, my friends: whatever you may have heard of the [STW.GetGRIFascistLeaderName], he is not a gentle nor kind-hearted griffon. I know this from personal experience. He has a plan for all of us, and it is a plan that will plunge our Empire into terrible strife the likes of which only the eldest of you have seen before. We must not allow this future to come to pass. If it is the last thing I do, I will stop it."\n\n"Today my voice is carried by radio waves to your homes. To be allowed this privilege, we have exploited the copper of Bronzehill, the timber of Angriver, and the manufactured components of Feathisia. All of these came together to be assembled in the heart of our empire, Griffenheim. This radio is but an example of the good our unified empire can bring, a unity that is under threat by the [STW.GetGRIFascistLeaderName] at this very moment!"\n\n"Are you listening, friends? Do I have your ear? Good. Together, we can save the Empire.""

You all must support your families, and the squabbles of griffons such as myself and the [STW.GetGRIFascistLeaderName] can seem distant and insignificant next to your own troubles."\n\n"But you must understand, it is not the plots of the nobles that enacts change in this wonderful empire. It is the heart of the common griffon that works our fields, that pumps in our factories, that—when uncaring rulers come to threaten that which we cherish—bolsters our armies and stands firm against any that would attempt to destroy us."\n\n"It has always been you, my friends, and this is why I come to you now. I cannot save the Empire alone. But with your help, and with the help of your siblings and cousins and friends, nothing can stop us! We must band together, noble and commoner alike, and speak as one to let the [STW.GetGRIFascistLeaderName] and all like him know:"\n\n"We will not let him tear our empire apart!

It is us who guides the common griffon, who ensures their toil is not wasted on insignificant causes, who dons the magnificent armor of a knight and charges headfirst into battle. The commoners need us to survive. We are their guardians, their mentors, the leaders that keep them united in prosperity where alone they would fall behind."\n\n"Now I call on you once more. My fellow nobles, our very way of life is endangered, and it is time for us to band together and face the threat of the [STW.GetGRIFascistLeaderName] as a single voice!"\n\n"I know you've given much for the common griffon already, but now it is our responsibility to give yet more, for without us, the glorious empire we've forged will be torn asunder.""

strawberry.34.d:0 "The sun hung low in the sky, the orange rays of sunset bathing Duchess Gabriela's rooms in a warm glow as she stood before her mirrors. She turned left and right, examining herself from every angle, trying different stances. Should she present herself as the regal Duchess, coldly commanding the loyalty of her vassals? Or the friendly Gabriela, asking favors from companions with a warm smile and kind eyes? The weight of duty hung heavy on her shoulders; a misstep within sight of her nobles could cost her their respect and, ultimately, the Empire at large. \n\nShe sighed, dropping the put-on poses and allowing the weary griffoness underneath to be seen. All this stress over a costume party? Perhaps she should just let herself relax, even if only for one night. After all, what better mask to face down the nobility but the honest party host, eager to leave the politics behind for just a few hours of merriment? \n\nGabriela nodded into the mirror, her decision made, and opened the door to the hall. The band was playing a lively tune, audible even through all the walls in the way, and Gabriela found herself stepping in rhythm with a small smile on her face. \n\nSoon the chatter of her guests came into earshot. It grew louder and louder as she approached the foyer, and with one last corner to turn, Gabriela paused to take a deep breath."

strawberry.39.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] Accepts Our Training Proposal!"
strawberry.39.d:0 "The weather was clear all week in the fields of Winterbell as our troops drilled and marched alongside visiting soldiers from [From.GetNameDef]. Both sides worked themselves hard, each aiming to prove their worth to the other, and the week was brought to a close by a three-day-long joint exercise in Osnabeak. Both sides walked away with many lessons learned and new friendships forged. If it comes to war, our troops can rest assured that any allies from [From.GetNameDef] will have their backs."

strawberry.38.a:0 "Blast!"

strawberry.40.t:0 "The Nobles' Support Comes Through!"
strawberry.40.d:0 "The nobles made their promises in a time of peace, nodding and smiling at the mention of future reward. Now the time has come for them to show their loyalty, and Gabriela was not disappointed. High-ranking griffons from across the country all streamed in to her court at her summons, each one with lists of soldiers raised and weapons delivered. Gabriela couldn't help but smile throughout the seemingly endless talks; all her careful planning was finally coming to fruition."

strawberry.41.t:0 "Potato Customs"
strawberry.41.d:0 "It was late in the evening when Edgar Greyfeather and his team of smugglers caught sight of the imperial patrol approaching from down the road. The team are disguised as simple farmers, their cargo of stolen arms hidden beneath a wagonload of dusty brown potatoes, and it's not the first time they've passed patrols on the road. They kept their heads down, playing the part of the cowed commoner that often appears so invisible to imperial troops, but today their luck had run out.\n\n"Halt, farmer." \n\nEdgar looked up, keeping his eyes carefully focused on the soldier's beak. "Can we help you, sir? We were just on our way to Flussschloss to sell our harvest." \n\nThe soldier grinned. "Then it's your lucky day, farmer. My troops are hungry. Give us half of your harvest here, and the Empire will compensate you fairly." \n\nEdgar's eyes widened as the soldier started towards the back of the wagon, one talon poised to throw back the tarp laid over it and inspect the cargo more closely. He rushes to stammar out an excuse, following at the soldier's side. "Uh, sir, please, we already have buyers for these potatoes. We cannot—" \n\nThe soldier waved him away as he began to pull at the tarp. "Unfortunate, but imperial troops take precedent. I'm sure your buyers will understand." Edgar watched with a grimace as the tarp was pulled away, exposing the cargo to the setting sun. There was only a thin layer of potatoes covering the crates of weapons, and the soldier frowned as he pointed to the imperial seal emblazoned on one of the crates. "What is this?" \n\nEdgar looked to one of his partners, his eyes wide, and she dipped her head, deferring to his judgment. It was impossible to hide the guns now, but the operation could still be saved. Perhaps a bribe or, if it came to blows, his team had the numbers advantage over the soldiers..."

strawberry.41.b:0 "Nobody will miss a few griffons."

strawberry.42.t:0 "Smuggler's Office Discovered"
strawberry.42.d:0 ""The Imperials are coming! We've been discovered!" \n\nChaos ensued in the dark, cramped confines of the smuggling den as griffons everywhere burst into action, some scrambling to escape through windows and boltholes while others rush about with papers fluttering out behind them. Barely audible over the din, the sound of imperial jackboots grows steadily louder. \n\nSomegriff needs to take charge, or all will be lost. Do we focus on burning all the evidence, or prioritize evacuating the site?"
strawberry.42.a:0 "Quick, run!"
strawberry.42.b:0 "Quick, burn the papers!"

strawberry.43.t:0 "Opportunity Strikes"
strawberry.43.d:0 "Boreas is with us today! One of our smugglers has made contact with a sympathetic imperial official in Osnabeak. The collaborator has created an opening in the guard patrols that should give us unfettered access to the local armory, and our smuggler assures us that the official has been thoroughly vetted by his team. We'll send a team immediately to exploit the opportunity. \n\nThe question is, how much do we take? Even if we escape unnoticed now, somegriff is bound to notice a completely empty armory!"
strawberry.43.a:0 "We must be cautious. Take only what won't be noticed."
strawberry.43.b:0 "We cannot let this opportunity go to waste!"

strawberry.44.t:0 "Smuggling Ring Revealed"
strawberry.44.d:0 "It seems our luck has finally ran out. Imperial officials stormed a number of our smuggling dens across the country, making dozens of arrests and bringing in several high-ranking members for interrogation. We have done all that we could to distance ourselves, but even if concrete proof of our involvement cannot be found, it is clear that we are considered the prime suspect. This will hurt our relations with the Empire significantly."
strawberry.44.a:0 "We knew it wouldn't last forever."

strawberry.45.t:0 "Sabotage!"
strawberry.45.d:0 "A deafening explosion woke many of the sleeping citizens of the Empire last night, sending out a shockwave that shattered windows for miles around. Miraculously, there were no deaths, but one of our factories has suffered heavy damage. \n\nWhoever the saboteurs were, they've slipped away without a trace."
strawberry.45.a:0 "We must be more watchful!"

strawberry.46.t:0 "Sabotage!"
strawberry.46.d:0 "A deafening explosion woke many of the sleeping citizens of the Empire last night, sending out a shockwave that shattered windows for miles around. Our patrols did manage to apprehend one of the culprits as they fled the site, but his fellow saboteurs were able to break him free before we completed our interrogation. Even still, we had enough time to get an employer out of the saboteur: the attack was organized by the Strawberry Duchy! \n\nMiraculously, there were no deaths, but one of our factories has suffered heavy damage. Nonetheless, we cannot allow this trespass against our authority to go unpunished!"
strawberry.46.a:0 "Strawberry Duchy will pay for this!"

strawberry.47.t:0 "The Archon Seizes Weapons!"
strawberry.47.d:0 "It seems that we have overplayed our claw. The Archon sent a strongly worded letter today, delivered by a unit of imperial troops, admonishing us for our disloyalty to the Empire and the gods and demanding that we return our stockpiled weapons immediately—or he shall treat our behavior as a declaration of war. \n\nAs much as we may despise the Archon, now is not the time to start a war. We were able to hide many of the weapons away, but many others were found and confiscated. For now, we must bide our time."
strawberry.47.a:0 "But we need those!"

strawberry.48.t:0 "Imperial Sanctions!"
strawberry.48.d:0 "The Duchess, ever too busy for her own country, apparently has found the time to install a set of hefty imperial sanctions on us. In a public statement she spoke with quiet disappointment, shaming "her dear griffons" for their disloyalty to her and to the Empire, and expressing hope that these sanctions would help guide us back to "the higher path." \n\nFor now we bow our heads and feign guilt, for direct confrontation could lead to a war we're not yet prepared for. These sanctions will hurt, but we will recover."
strawberry.48.a:0 "Our apologies, Duchess."

strawberry.49.t:0 "The Archon's Reward"
strawberry.49.d:0 "The Archon has finally taken notice of our loyalty! A shipment of weapons arrived in Readewetter today, brand new guns all stamped with the imperial seal and accompanied by an official commendation of approval for our unwavering support of the Empire. "With these weapons," the letter reads, "I'm certain you will continue to serve as a shining beacon of imperial service.""
strawberry.49.a:0 "Service is it's own reward, but guns help too."

strawberry.50.t:0 "The Duchess's Reward"
strawberry.50.d:0 "Our hard work and dedication has paid off at last! Although Duchess Gabriela could not find time to personally visit her regency council in Readewetter, she did hold a speech in Griffenheim lauding her homeland for its loyalty and service to the Empire. "Strawberry Duchy is a shining example of what we can achieve if we all work together," she said, "and I cannot wait to see what our future holds.""
strawberry.50.a:0 "Our faith in the Duchess pays off again."


strawberry.51.t:0 "The Foyer"
strawberry.51.sober:0 "The foyer of the royal palace was awash with activity, with the elite griffons of Strawberry all brushing wings under an array of glimmering, pink-tinted chandeliers and showing off their extravagant costumes. The ducal ensemble were playing a steady orchestral tune from a stage set up on the mezzanine, and several of the guests were engaged in measured dance steps upon the floor. A colorful spread of snacks was laid out on a long table next to bowls of strawberry punch, where the more reserved guests were gathered, and snippets of conversation from out in the gardens drifted in with the wind through the open windows. \n\nGabriela looked around, smiling in greeting to those she met eyes with, and considered her next step."
strawberry.51.tipsy:0 "The party had been going on for a couple hours now, and the festivities were in full swing. The assorted noblegriffs of Strawberry, usually haughty and reserved while out among the commoners, were now growing to be as raucous as any griffon could be. The ensemble had moved on to a more upbeat rhythm, with some of the members having undone their bowties or jackets in the growing heat of the room. The dance floor had long lost cohesion, with griffons dancing in scattered groups all around the expansive room, and the punch bowls had been shoved aside to make room for a keg of Strawberry wine straight from the royal cellar. Bursts of laughter could be heard from within the guest rooms and out in the garden, hinting at more fun behind the scenes. \n\nGabriela leaned against a wall with one talon held to her temple. It was growing a little difficult to stand... but did she really want the party to end already?"
strawberry.51.drunk:0 "The orchestra had gone silent. The dance floor was empty but for a few final survivors still moving to a beat that only they could apparently hear. Nobles were splayed out all over the furniture, some even sleeping directly on the floor, while maids gingerly stepped around them hoping to get a headstart on the cleaning. \n\nGabriela stumbled down the front steps of the garden with one last glass of wine clutched in her talons and her wings splayed out for balance. She looked up at the stars with a wide smile, the expensive wine spilling to the ground as she lost focus, and snickered at a funny memory."

"We've been looking for you all night, and it's almost time for your council meeting!" \n\nGabriela grimaced, clutching at her head with a moan as the servant's voice pounded at her skull like a hammer. What had she done last night? She remembered entering the party, and then deciding to open up the royal wine cellar, but then...? \n\nWith a wince and a sigh, Gabriela clambered to her talons and followed the servant back inside. Memories or not, no doubt she'd hear all about it before noon."

Regina was standing off to the side, minding herself away from the festivities. Uncle Eagleclaw was seated at a table alone as well—though his isolation was more likely due to the grim expression on his face than any solitary preference. And was that Gerlach there, standing on his own out in the gardens? \n\nShe looked between them all, considering who to approach."

strawberry.55.dick:0 ""Gerlach!" Gabriela smiled broadly as she stepped out into the crisp air of the gardens, calling her friend's name. "I'm so glad you could make it! I was so worried when I heard about—" she paused, blundering "—the attempt." \n\nGerlach turned, sparing her only a brief glance before returning his attention to the flowers swaying in the breeze in silence. \n\nGabriela frowned, drawing up short. Had she missed something? Had she wronged him in some way without knowing? No, he was probably just caught up mulling over the attempt on his life. She pressed on, coming to his side and brushing her wing softly against his. "Gerlach, are you well? Are you in pain? Perhaps some punch could help?" \n\nFinally he turned to face her, and the coldness in his eyes was so sharp that Gabriela actually took a step backwards in shock. "Why do you insist on ignoring my title, Duchess?" he spat. "Did you invite me here only to mock me?"\n\n"I—Gerlach, I—what's wrong? I thought we were friends?"\n\n"I have no friends," the Duke growled. "The next time you speak to me, you had best do it properly." He turned away sharply, almost striking her with his tail, and stalked deeper into the gardens. \n\nGabriela simply sat there, one talon raised and beak gaping as if she were about to speak, but no words came forth. The nerves she had felt before the party came back in force, and—after a brief struggle—the tears began to flow. \n\nSeveral minutes later, shivering from the cold and down one more old friend, Gabriela returned to the party."
strawberry.55.dead:0 ""Gerlach?" Gabriela approached hesitantly, her voice quiet. Her heart was racing, her words strained. "Is... is that you?" \n\nThe griffon before her turned, a broad smile on his face, and Gabriela's heart sank. This was not her Gerlach. No, this was an imposter, a minor noble she recognized from the Winterbell countryside, dressed in a crude mockey of the late Grand Duke's armor. His eye met hers, noting the tears brimming there, and the smile dropped from his face.\n\n"What are you doing, you cruel bird?!" Gabriela spat, rushing up and shoving the noble back. The hope that had welled within her had turned to a hot anger, and she unleashed it on the only thing she could. "Get out! Get out, before I strip you of every title!" \n\nThe noble stumbled back, wide-eyed, and scrambled away with his head low. Some of the other guests in the gardens had heard the commotion, peering over with curious eyes, and Gabriela glared at them each in turn as she struggled to rein in her tears.\n\n "He's dead," she spat, her talons scraping painfully against the pavement. "He's dead, and you'll never see him again!" \n\nThe guests turned away, wisely giving the grieving griffoness a wide berth as she stormed back into the foyer."
strawberry.55.sweet:0 ""Gerlach!" Gabriela smiled broadly as she stepped out into the crisp air of the gardens, calling her friend's name. "I'm so glad you could make it! What with everything happening, I had worried you might be too busy." \n\nGerlach turned to face her, the corner of his beak turning up in a small smirk. "I wouldn't miss this for the Empire, Gabriela. Things have been... hectic of late." \n\nGabriela's smile faded, her energy fading at his pensive tone, but she pressed on, pulling him to look at her with a fresh grin. "None of that tonight, Gerlach. I didn't invite you here so we could worry over titles and vassals and archons, after all." \n\nFor a moment he simply frowned at her, his expression unreadable, but then the wall cracked. He returned the smile, in his own, reserved way. "Yes, I suppose you're right. A night to just be ourselves together sounds... good." \n\nGabriela couldn't help but blush at the way he'd spoken the last word. She turned away, and the two of them spent a long moment enjoying the moonlit scenery of the garden together in a companionable silence. Gabriela stole a sideways glance up at him, admiring the sharp lines of his face, and she felt her pulse quicken. \n\nOn a whim, she took a step closer, tangling her wing with his. Five heart-pounding seconds later, he pulled the wing away—only to wrap it around her shoulders. \n\nGabriela returned to the party perhaps an hour later, and her laugh was more honest that night than it had been in years."

Her sister had tried to keep herself out of the mess of the night as much as she could, preferring to observe from the sidelines rather than indulge in the finer aspects of life. But Gabriela needed her steady claw right now, so she quickly made her way over to her sister, receiving a warm smile in greeting. "Gabby! Finally finding time to enjoy yourself?"\n\n Gabriela chuckled. "I am, dear sister. It's good to be home, and I'm glad to be back here rather than stuck in the halls of Griffenheim."\n\n"Oh, but the halls of power are so much more your style, Gabby. You fit in so well with the political wrangling of that scene—not so well with the wine-soaked parties of this one." Both of them laughed together at that. \n\nThe laughter died down into a muted silence as Gabriela remembered their time together as children, having fun before the matters of state forced them slowly apart, "Well, Regina, maybe I do have more of an affinity for politics than wine, but I think I really needed this. It helps to clear my head a bit." Her look became stern for a moment before turning to her sister once more. "I'll need that if we're to get through this ordeal.""

strawberry.57.t:0 "A Toast To The Empire"
strawberry.57.loyal:0 ""A fine party you have here, Gabriela." The priest of Boreas raised his glass in greeting as the griffoness approached. "This splendor is a brilliant example of the wealth brought to us by the gods." \n\nGabriela smiled, hiding her disagreement with the sentiment. "Indeed, Uncle. They've blessed us with diligent workers and bountiful harvests."\n\n"And strong soldiers! Don't forget that one." The priest shook his head as he pointed at one of the guests, a griffon dressed up as the Archon himself. "Look at that disrespect, Gabriela. Shameful. What is that one's name?" \n\nGabriela stiffened. She did know the noble in that costume, yes, but giving up his name would likely lead to trouble for him. "I'm afraid I can't recognize him in that get-up, Uncle," she lied.\n\n "Ah. Shame, but no worries. I will speak to the slanderer myself." \n\nThinking quickly, Gabriela grabbed two full glasses off of a passing servant's tray. "Uncle, please, let it rest for now?" He turned to her with a confused frown, and she held out one of the glasses. "I invited you here to relax. You can always track him down later, but for now, why don't we share a toast?" \n\nUncle Eagleclaw cocked his head, eye's darting between Gabriela and the mock Archon. At last he accepted the offered glass, raising it high along with his voice. "Very well, then! To the Archon, to the gods, and to the Griffonian Empire!" \n\nThe guests around them all raised their glasses high, and as voices were raised in toast, Gabriela shot a meaningful glance towards the costumed Archon, warning him away."
strawberry.57.suspicious:0 ""Ah, Duchess Gabriela." Uncle Julius's greeting was cold as Gabriela approached. He didn't even rise from his seat. "I admit, I was surprised to recieve your invitation." \n\nGabriela answered with a curious smile. "And why would I not invite my wonderful uncle to my party? We are family, after all."\n\n"By blood, perhaps, but not by cause." He waggled a crooked talon at her as if she were a misbehaved child. "You don't think I can't tell what you're up to?"\n\n"Oh?" Gabriela grabbed a pair of full glasses from a passing servant's tray, holding one out with an innocent expression. "And what am I up to, Uncle?"\n\n He shoved the offered glass aside with a smoldering glare. "Don't play coy with me, my niece. You think you're safe because you remain in the shadows? All enemies of the Empire will face their deserved fate in the end." \n\nGabriela frowned as she placed a glass on the table in front of the old priest. "Uncle, I have only the Empire's best interests at heart. Perhaps you'd like to join me in a toast to it's honor?" He only continued to glare, talons crossed over his chest, and so she raised her glass in the air alone, quieting the conversation around them. "To the Empire, to Grover V, and to all that he stood for in life!" \n\nA round of cheers filled the air as the surrounding nobles took up the toast, and Gabriela held her Uncle's cold gaze as she drank deeply from her glass."

strawberry.58.t:0 "The Duchess And The Archon"
strawberry.58.d:0 "Gabriela approached the griffon dressed as her bitter rival, Archon Eros. His apparel and make-up was very convincing indeed; it captured the look of that cranky ancient griffon well, and the clothing matched that of a proper Archon. If it weren't for the differently coloured pupils and other subtle differences, Gabriela would've been sure that it was Eros himself who had infiltrated her party, with the intent to ruin it with his zealous preaching. She felt almost offended that someone had dressed up as her nemesis, but maintained her composure.\n\n"Greetings, esteemed Archon. What brings you here to my party?" Gabriela asked, forcing herself to sound polite.\nThe "Archon" nodded respectfully. "Ah, dear Gabriela. I came here to make amends with you and the fine griffons of Strawberry. Our rivalry has continued for far too long. Perhaps it's time we put our differences aside and work together at last?" He extended his claw, waiting for the Duchess to shake it.\nGabriela hesitated. It seemed unreal, because it was unreal. Could all those decades of rivalry and contempt be brushed aside so easily? No. But this was just an act. A game. A dream. So she decided to pretend it was possible, shook the claw and smiled. "I think it's about time we do that. Together, we can make the Empire prosper.""

strawberry.59.t:0 "Doppelganger!"
strawberry.59.d:0 "Gabriela saw a familiar face in the distance. No, it was not merely a familiar face. It was her very own face. This strange griffoness looked so much alike, with merely a simple mask obscuring her face. Intrigued, she made her way over to the stranger. "How are you enjoying the party?"\n\n"Duchess!" she exclaimed. "It is an honour. The party is simply lovely," the griffoness responded in a pleasant, melodic voice. Perhaps it was all the alcohol and the music, but Gabriela couldn't help herself but feel a bit impressed over just how well the griffoness copied her mannerisms. Yet there was still part of her brain telling her it could be a trap. Could this be a spy? A doppelganger sent by her enemies to replace her? \n\nNo, that would be ridiculous.\n\n"Are these your natural colors?" she asked, gesturing towards her clone's plumage. \n\nThe other Gabriela sat back, wings half-flaring with pride. "Unfortunately not, Duchess! I spent three days and three nights mixing paints, comparing them to photos of you I had taken while you were out in public, searching for the perfect pigments! My own colors are far less beautiful than yours. But for just this one night, I thought, I would be able to live in your image." \n\nGabriela blinked. "Ah. Yes. I see." \n\nShe turned away, raising her glass to her beak and downing the contents. That griffoness was too honest to be a spy, but that somehow made it even more disturbing."

strawberry.60.t:0 "The Doctor's Cure"
strawberry.60.d:0 ""Duchess! Duchess, wait!" \n\nGabriela drew up short with a bemused smile as the griffon in the plague doctor costume walked a circle around her, making a great show of inspecting her as if for disease. "What is it, doctor?" she asked. "Have I contracted the plague?" \n\nThe plague doctor scratched at his wing with a wing, leaning in close until the elongated beak of his mask was almost tapping against hers. "Hrm. No, Duchess, it is not the plague! I'm afraid it's much worse! But do not worry—" he stepped back, producing a glass of strawberry wine with a flourish of his other wing "—for I have the solution!" \n\nGabriela couldn't help but roll her eyes even as she laughed at the other griffon's antics. A small circle of watchers had gathered to observe the commotion, and she turned to face them as she accepted the glass. "Well if this is the cure, perhaps we should all take a dose, just to be safe!" \n\nA round of laughter broke out among the watchers, and a servant distributed glasses as the plague doctor bounced between them, drawing out more laughs."

strawberry.61.t:0 "Bloodbath!"
strawberry.61.d:0 ""Excuse me." Gabriela raised a talon to tap at the strange griffon's shoulder. "But is that blood?" \n\nThe griffon turned to face her, his eyes wide. "Ah, er, no! It's—I mean, yes, it is blood!" He let out a frustrated sigh. "Well, okay, it's replica blood." \n\nGabriela arched a brow. "Replica blood?" \n\nAfter a few seconds of grimacing, the griffon shrugged and hung his head. "It's ketchup." \n\nGabriela couldn't help but snort at that, one talon flying up to stifle her laughter just a moment too late. "I'm sorry, but why are you covered in ketchup?"\n\n"Well it's a costume party, isn't it?" the griffon countered, bristling. "My damned tailor messed up my costume, and so this was the best I could come up with last minute. Fake blood. I'm a cultist!"\n\n"Ah, of course, a cultist." Gabriela winked, suppressing another bout of laughter. "A cultist of what, per chance?" \n\nAfter some thought, the griffon grabbed an empty glass and scooped it through the punch bowl. "A cultist of booze!" \n\nA scattered wave of applause passed through the crowd, and with a shake of her head, Gabriela went to fill her own glass."

strawberry.62.t:0 "The Punch Table" 
strawberry.62.d:0 ""Ah, Duchess!" one of the guests—this one dressed as a jester—raised his glass in welcome as Gabriela approached the snack table. "Finally come to sample the punch?"\n\n"Of course. I could hardly host a party without ensuring the drinks are of quality, after all." She smiled as she grabbed a glass and scooped it through the bowl, the ice floating within swirling about wildly with the motion. Bringing the glass to her beak, Gabriela arched a brow as she detected a surprisingly bitter taste in what should have been a light, strawberry-flavored drink. \n\nThe jester was eyeing her with an eager smile as she drank. "I hope you don't mind, Duchess, but the punch felt a little weak, so I took the liberty of adding some kick. How can we be expected to party with all these inhibitions in the way?" \n\nGabriela frowned at first. She didn't like the idea of the punch being spiked without her permission. Still, it was all in good fun, wasn't it? She replaced the frown with a smirk, winking before turning back to the party at large. "I'm sure it'll be fine, as long as everygriff knows how to hold their liquor.""
strawberry.62.a:0 "Let's go." #returns to the foyer, adds 2 drunkenness

strawberry.63.t:0 "Strawberry Pride" 
strawberry.63.d:0 "'This is too weak' Gabriela thought as she meandered down the hallways, thought and speech slightly slurred from the generous 'sampling' of the punch she had undertaken earlier. Slowly edging herself out of any conversations that the guests wanted to ambush her with, she made her way through the private corridors of the castle and down to the cellar with the castle's wine.\n\n"Your Grace. We thought you would be in the ballrooms!" the servants exclaimed as they saw their sovereign come down the stairs.\n\nGabriela narrowed her eyes. "I have decided to sample the wine. Personally." Protests from the servants quieted down and they brought her three bottles. She uncorked them one after another with her neatly manicured claws, taking in the odeur of fermented grapes, before pouring herself a glass of wine. She took a gulp. Then another. And then another one until the glass was empty.\n\nShe poured herself another glass and swallowed its contents in one fell swoop. Then another. And then until the bottles were gone.\n\nAs the servants brought her another bottle, the slight frown on her face when she arrived slowly turned into a big smile."

strawberry.64.t:0 "A Successful Party!"
strawberry.64.d:0 ""Your attention, please." Gabriela tapped against her glass with a fork. "I'd like to say something." \n\nThe party stilled, her guests all looking up to her with a spread of curiosity, disinterest, and impatience to return to the festivities. She scanned the crowd with a kind smile, glad that her guests seemed to be enjoying themselves.\n\n"This party has been all that I hoped, and you have all been wonderful guests. Today we've come together in the spirit of unity, and I cannot emphasize how glad I am to see nobles from all across the Duchy, even some from across the Empire, meeting and drinking without animosity."\n\n"For now, however, it is late, and I am tired and many of you—or so I believe—are approaching drunk." She paused, allowing a wave of laughter to pass through the crowd. "As such, I think now would be a good time to bring the festivities to a close. Let us all take one last sip of our drinks, and return to our homes with smiles on our beaks and hopes in our heads! To Strawberry!" \n\nThe crowd took up the call without hesitation, raising their glasses in toast, and as one they all threw their heads back and downed the last of their drinks. \n\nGabriela watched the attendees file out of the palace with a smile on her face. The party had certainly been interesting, if nothing else, and now she was quite looking forwards to a good night's rest. Tomorrow, she would need to throw herself into her work once more."

CAN_medium_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "As early as 1005/1006, General Vect envisioned two basic tank types to act as the most numerous equipment for the future Changeling Panzer Divisions. The first vehicle was to be armed with anti-tank gun and two machine guns and the second one was to be a support vehicle armed with a larger calibre gun. The first one eventually became known as Panzerkampfwagen III, which was to be a standard tank for the three light companies of a tank battalion. The second one became known as Panzerkampfwagen IV."

CAN_medium_tank_equipment_2:0 "Panzerkampfwagen IV"
CAN_medium_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "Designed as an infantry-support tank, the Panzer IV was not originally intended to engage enemy armour - that function was performed by the lighter Panzer III. However, with the flaws of pre-war doctrine becoming apparent and in the face of Stalliongradian T-34 tanks, the Panzer IV soon assumed the tank-fighting role of its increasingly obsolete cousin. The most widely manufactured and deployed Changeling tank, the Panzer IV was used as the base for many other fighting vehicles."

CAN_medium_tank_equipment_3:0 "Panzerkampfwagen V Panther"
CAN_medium_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Panther is the common name of a medium tank deployed by Changelings from mid-1014. It was intended as a counter to the Stalliongradian T-34, and as a replacement for the Panzer III and Panzer IV. While never replacing the latter, it served alongside the heavier Tiger tank. The Panther's excellent combination of firepower, mobility, and protection served as a benchmark for other nations' late war and post-war tank designs, and it is regarded as one of the best tanks ever created."

Большинство БТРов и БМП имеют полностью гусеничный ход, или же это полноприводный транспорт, с колёсной формулой 6x6 или 8x8, для хорошей мобильности на пересечённой местности."

CHN_Army:0 "Revitalize The Military"

CHN_Infantry_1_desc:0 "Without the support companies to back it up, any military will crack and fall under the weight of its own logistics and necessary specialised backup."
CHN_Chemical_Weapons:0 "Establish RCAMICD"
CHN_Chemical_Weapons_desc:0 "The Royal Changeling Army Medicial Research Institute of Chemical Defence will ensure that our artillery can flush out any potential hostiles by denying them access to key areas without specialised forces equipped to deal with chemical warfare."
CHN_Jager_1:0 "Improved Jager Tactics"
CHN_Jager_1_desc:0 "While the jagers that us changelings employ are amongst the most well trained special forces, ensuring that they are kept up to date on modern doctrine and asymmetrical warfare will give them an advantage."

CHN_Blitzkrieg_1:0 "Panzer Modernization"

CHN_Infiltrators:0 "Infiltration Tactics"
CHN_Infiltrators_desc:0 "Giving our infiltrator units better tactics and training will increase their chances of fitting in with any hostile entity."
CHN_Support_Companies_1:0 "Support Equipment"
CHN_Support_Companies_1_desc:0 "Investing in better support equipment, such as medicine, will not only keep our forces on the field, but as few changeling lives are lost."
CHN_Motorized_2:0 "Mechanized Infantry"

CHN_Renewed_Militarization:0 "Renew Militarization"
CHN_Renewed_Militarization_desc:0 "Queen Chrysalis has been defeated, and all thanks to the soldiers that fought for friendship. It's time to focus on bringing the Changeling militias from an emergency force to something professional, that any changelings can be proud to serve in."
CHN_Air_Force:0 "Revitalize The Luftwaffe"

CHN_Bomber_1:0 "Tactical Bombers"

CHN_Bomber_2:0 "Close Air Support"
CHN_Bomber_2_desc:0 "Dive bombers and other ground attack planes will bring an important advantage to the forces on the ground, keeping the enemy suppressed at longer ranges than convential fire, and taking out strategic targets."
CHN_Bomber_3:0 "Strategic Bombers"
CHN_Bomber_3_desc:0 "Long range, high altitude strategic bombers can deliver a crippling strike to the industry of a hypothetical enemy. It may be that one factory that builds that one rifle that wins the war."
CHN_Paratroopers:0 "Paratroopers"
CHN_Paratroopers_desc:0 "Using the wings of changeling soldiers allows us to drop more elite units behind enemy lines and take keypoints to, say, encircle them, or to secure ports for a larger invasion."
CHN_Fighter_1:0 "Fighters"
CHN_Fighter_1_desc:0 "Development of fighter aircraft in general is something that would help not only the air force, but also the civilian recreational sector too."
CHN_Fighter_2:0 "Advanced Fighters"

CHN_Wunderwaffe:0 "Wunderwaffe"
CHN_Wunderwaffe_desc:0 "The nuclear theory, codenamed 'wunderwaffe', is our greatest secret as a changeling nation. To let any other nation know about our experiments into splitting the atom would be to risk war."
CHN_Rocketry_Phase_Two:0 "Continued Rocket Tests"
CHN_Rocketry_Phase_Two_desc:0 "The initial tests of solid fuel rockets and pulsejets were successful, but if we move to liquid fuel, not only do we get a better range out of our rockets, but we can lower the throttle when required."
CHN_Jets:0 "Jet Engines"
CHN_Jets_desc:0 "The jet engine is not only a very complex piece of machine, but it can utterly revolutionise civilian aerospace, and the military air space. Higher speeds, longer ranges. But first, we need an engine."
CHN_Jet_Fighter:0 "Jet Fighters"
CHN_Jet_Fighter_desc:0 "With our engine ready for production, we need to develop a plane purpose built for the purpose of flying at high speeds, while under high thrust numbers."
CHN_Jet_Tactical_Bomber:0 "Jet Tactical Bombers"
CHN_Jet_Tactical_Bomber_desc:0 "A midrange tactical bomber has no need to have defensive armament like its conventially propelled predecessors, as they can theoretically outrun their enemies. In addition, it might make a good passenger plane."

CHN_defend_the_north:0 "Northern Defenses"
CHN_defend_the_north_desc:0 "Despite our desires to be peaceful and share friendship, other nations are unpredictable. If the North were to fall, our enemy would not only control our coast, but be one step closer to Vesalipolis."

CHN_Changeling_Naval_Supremacy:0 "Naval Purchase"
CHN_Changeling_Naval_Supremacy_desc:0 "If there was a navy before the civil war, Chrysalis and those still loyal to her scuttled it before we could take it. As a result, we'll have to purchase spare ships from our neighbors."

CHN_Naval_Bomber:0 "Torpedo Bombers"
CHN_Naval_Bomber_desc:0 "Naval Torpedo Bombers, when used properly, have the potential to not only sink a ship, but sink an entire hostile fleet. Ensuring we've got the best naval fighters will give us a great advantage."
CHN_Navy_Doctrine:0 "Doctrinal Effort"
CHN_Navy_Doctrine_desc:0 "Without the proper doctrine to support them, no ship is capable of doing its job correctly. Developing better naval theory is paramount."
CHN_Destroyers:0 "Improved Destroyers"
CHN_Destroyers_desc:0 "Destroyers are part of the backbone of every navy, without them, the larger ships are vulnerable to submarines and other destroyers."
CHN_Light_Cruisers:0 "Modernized Cruisers"

CHN_Escort_Carriers:0 "Escort Carrier Designs"
CHN_Escort_Carriers_desc:0 "While not as large as fleet carriers, escort carriers are useful for ensuring that our smaller fleets have naval air power to back them up, no matter the situation."
CHN_Carriers:0 "Modern Carrier Designs"
CHN_Carriers_desc:0 "Bigger carriers with more deck space is the omega, the end, of the carrier development. Such a ship would be the epitome of naval warfare."
CHN_Heavy_Cruisers:0 "Heavy Cruiser Designs"
CHN_Heavy_Cruisers_desc:0 "Battleships, while no doubt impressive, still need support from their smaller sisters. Heavy cruisers not only provide anti-air support, but also bring main armament to match the might of the battleship."
CHN_Battlecruisers:0 "Battlecruisers Designs"
CHN_Battlecruisers_desc:0 "Even with the impressive combination of firepower from both heavy cruisers and battleships, there still needs to be something in the middle to fill the place of either of the other two if they are otherwise unavailable. A Battlecruiser."
CHN_Battleships:0 "Battleship Designs"
CHN_Battleships_desc:0 "The final form of the battleship is the image most imagine. Heavy armor, huge guns, and with enough size to send any lesser enemy retreating back to their home port."
CHN_Marine_Operations:0 "Marine Tactics"
CHN_Marine_Operations_desc:0 "The development of amphibious troops designed to attack enemies where no land path is possible is something that should be focused on, as the advantage it would deliver is beyond immeasurable."
CHN_Swarms_In_The_Sky:0 "Swarms In The Sky"
CHN_Swarms_In_The_Sky_desc:0 "Filling the skies fighters from both the Air Force and the Naval Air Force will guarantee our victory, as no hostiles planes will remain up to strike us."
CHN_Bomber_Command:0 "Bomber Command"
CHN_Bomber_Command_desc:0 "Creating a unit solely for the purpose of directing our bombers will not only increase effectiveness of communications, but guarantee the right targets are struck."
CHN_Hive_Factories:0 "Chunchi Lumber Industry"
CHN_Hive_Factories_desc:0 "Our main source of wood comes from Chunchi. Expanding and developing in the region will allow us to better take care of, and harvest, the forests."

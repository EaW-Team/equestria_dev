changelings.1.t:0 "Оленийский вопрос"
changelings.1.d:0 "Мы готовы отправить оленям претензии на два северных региона."
changelings.1.a:0 "Отлично, отправляйте."
changelings.2.t:0 "Протекторат над Оленией."
changelings.2.d:0 "Мы предлагаем Олении перейти под наше управление. Королева Кризалис благосклонна к своим подданным. Было бы глупо не принять такое предложение."
changelings.2.a:0 "Отправляйте!"
changelings.3.t:0 "Хс-с-с-с!"
changelings.4.t:0 "Регионы перешли под наш контроль"
changelings.4.d:0 "Оления согласилась."
changelings.4.a:0 "Прекрасно!"
changelings.5.t:0 "Требования отклонены"
changelings.5.d:0 "Наше предложение передать Солгуд Бергскедьйа и Фирдалар было отклонено."
changelings.5.a:0 "Что они о себе возомнили?"
changelings.6.t:0 "Оления согласилась стать нашим протекторатом!"
changelings.6.d:0 "Мы получили сообщение от короля Олении. Он согласился перейти под нашу защиту."
changelings.6.a:0 "*звуки довольной дыркокопытной королевы*"
changelings.7.t:0 "Оления отклонила наше предложение!"
changelings.7.d:0 "Король Олении грубо отклонил наши требования. Королева Кризалис недовольна и уже приказала начать подготовку вторжения."
changelings.7.a:0 "Мы всё равно получим своё!"
changelings.8.t:0 "Оления сдаётся!"
changelings.8.d:0 "Глупый король Олении согласился сдаться после того, как наши солдаты шагнули на его земли. Какой трусливый противник."
changelings.8.a:0 "Куда подевалась его храбрость?"
changelings.16.t:0 "Агенты в Эквестрии"
changelings.16.d:0 "Принимать чей угодно облик - одна из невероятных способностей чейнджлингов. Она будет невероятно полезной против Эквестрии. Мы должны отправить специально обученных разведчиков, которые будут шпионить, подрывать производство и красть технологии."
changelings.16.a:0 "Верно!"
changelings.19.t:0 "Сомбра предлагает альянс!"
changelings.19.d:0 "Мы получили сообщение от Короля Сомбры, где он изъявляет желания заключить альянс между Чейнджлингам и Кристалльной Империей. Что мы ответим?"
changelings.19.a:0 "Никогда."
changelings.19.b:0 "С радостью!"
changelings.20.t:0 "Война неизбежна!"
changelings.20.d:0 "После тщательного изучения вооруженных сил Эквестрии мы пришли к выводу, что наша армия будет обладать превосходством на раннем этапе военных действий. Однако если мы продолжим откладывать вторжение, Эквестрия успеет реорганизовать свои дивизии и встретить нас во всеоружии. Мы должны действовать немедленно."
changelings.20.a:0 "Вперёд!!"
changelings.21.t:0 "Предложение от короля Сомбры"
changelings.21.d:0 "Мы получили ноту от Сомбры - короля Кристальной Империи. Он желает стать мужем нашей прекрасной королевы. Ваше Величество, каков будет Ваш ответ?"
changelings.21.a:0 "Я согласна."
changelings.21.b:0 "Я не желаю быть его женой."
changelings.22.t:0 "Страна Джунглей просит нашей защиты."
changelings.22.d:0 "Бандиты из джунглей предложили нам стать их повелителями и спасти их жизни."
changelings.22.a:0 "Хорошо."
changelings.22.b:0 "Нет."
changelings.24.t:0 "Контрреволюция?"
changelings.24.d:0 "Маршал Триммель слишком опасен, чтобы ему доверять. Он был одним из самых доверенных лиц Королевы. Когда Королева покинула страну, лоялисты обратили свой взор на Маршала. Давайте покончим с проблемой до того, как она начнётся."
changelings.24.a:0 "Бомба активирована."
changelings.25.t:0 "Освободительный фронт берет власть в свои копыта"
changelings.25.d:0 "Королева покинула страну в неизвестном направлении. Впервые в истории власть перешла к народным массам. Поступило несколько предложений по поводу нового названия нашего государства. По итогам голосования наше государство получило название Федеративный коллектив чейнджлингов."
changelings.25.a:0 "Да здравствует свобода!"
changelings.26.t:0 "Союз прогрессистов берет власть в свои копыта"
changelings.26.d:0 "Королева покинула страну в неизвестном направлении. Впервые в истории мы сами управляем собственной судьбой. Было предложено несколько новых названий для нашей новой страны. По итогам голосования наше государство получило название Союз ульев чейнджлингов."
changelings.26.a:0 "Да здравствует прогресс!"
changelings.27.t:0 "Операция удалась"
changelings.27.d:0 "Мы успешно узурпировали контроль у Оленийской Партии Общества и их идиотского монарха. Время разделить территории."
changelings.27.a:0 "Мы снова показали миру наше могущество!"
changelings.28.t:0 "Усилить Коммисариаты"
changelings.28.d:0 "С созданием нами нескольких коммисариатов, мы должны снабдить их адекватными силами, чтобы сохранять мир и предотвратить контр-революцию."
changelings.28.a:0 "Создать Почётную Охрану Коммисариатов"
changelings.29.t:0 "Шпионаж или война?"
changelings.29.d:0 "Пришёл момент истины, какова ваша воля Товарищ Председатель?"
changelings.29.b:0 "Мы должны продолжить наш шпионаж против Олении"
changelings.29.a:0 "Мы завоюем Олению! Приведите Белый план в действие!"
changelings.31.t:0 "Подозрительная активность"
changelings.31.d:0 "Что-то не так, несколько патрулей на границе пропали без вести и активность коммунистов внезапно возрасла до небес, мы подозреваем, что чейнджлинги пересекли границу."
changelings.31.b:0 "Найдите, что бы это ни было, немедленно!"
changelings.31.a:0 "Я уверен, мы можем справиться с этим в конце концов, сейчас у нас имеются другие заботы."
changelings.32.t:0 "Операция "Furfore Chrysalis!""
changelings.32.d:0 "Началсь война! Наши саботажники в тылу врага связались с нами и открыли своё местоположение. Кто знал, что будет так легко спрятаться в тылу, нарядившись фермерами?"
changelings.32.a:0 "Глупые пони, надеюсь, мы сможем отрезать Ванхувер."
changelings.35.t:0 "Ополчение Зекоры!"
changelings.35.d:0 "Убейте их, живо!"
changelings.35.a:0 "..."
changelings.900.t:0 "Мы, медведи, проиграли."
changelings.900.d:0 "Невозможно! Чейнджлинги теперь правят нашей родиной!"
changelings.900.a:0 "Нет!"
changelings.901.t:0 "Жизнь Пингвинов подошла к концу"
changelings.901.d:0 "Чейджлинги забрали себе нашу землю!"
changelings.901.a:0 "Нет!"
changelings.902.t:0 "Нова Грифония пала."
changelings.902.d:0 "Нова Грифония теперь ничто, чем она и была год назад. Непредвиденная угроза пришла с запада. Мы отступили на нашу родину!"
changelings.902.a:0 "О нет!"
changelings.903.t:0 "Наш Город больше не наш :С"
changelings.903.d:0 "Никогда не верь чейнджлингам!"
changelings.903.a:0 "Проклятье!"
changelings.910.t:0 "Сохранено!"
changelings.910.d:0 "Мы никогда не дадим чейнджлингам править на нашей земле!"
changelings.910.a:0 "Мы вернулись!"

###Tech Ideas ###
###War Singers ###
###War Singer Company I - Our War Singers play an essential role on the battlefield, a role in keeping the troops' spirits up.
###War Singer Company II - Techniques to throw our voices at larger volumes and new tunes to ease the nerves in the midst of battle.
###War Singer Company III - Stressing the importance of keeping their buddy stable and ready to fight because they've got guns and the only thing that we'll be carrying along is our friends, our heart and a cone.
###War Singer Company IV - Our friend Pinkie Pie had laid new innovation from her basic megaphone, we've replicated the very design that would "blow the socks off our own generals".
###War Singer Company V - Wisely selecting specific songs and tunes to reflect the strategy to be used and tactics as a cover can confuse the enemies.
###War Singer Company VI - Our War Singers scoff at the thought of death, the camaraderie of their fellow soldiers and the intrinsic devotion of the very songs they sing assist in a soldier that most would follow.
### Tactics ###


### CraftYakship ###
### Dividing up Labor - Establishing branches for which our workers are stationed can assist in much larger output. ###
### Interchangeable Parts - Parts that are easily replaceable as they are to create can assure satisfaction among the higher ups. ###
### Assembly Lines -  Establishing new ways for which are work can be at the ready for the troops with stronger and assurance in care.###
### Pressing Government Ordinances - Regardless how tedious it may appear, setting standards placed upon our products can assure our troops a safer return and at further peak peformance.  ###
### Friendly Local Suppliers - Promoting close-knit relationship between local suppliers and industries can allow construction of projects with much more ease. ###
### Early Robotics - Early prototypes of our "Robo-yaks" will be used to assure quality at a faster rate and catching mistakes that ordinary Yaks would.###
### Survival ###

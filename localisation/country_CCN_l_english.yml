CCN_Naval_Bomber:0 "Torpedo Bombers"
CCN_Naval_Bomber_desc:0 "Naval Torpedo Bombers, when used properly, have the potential to not only sink a ship, but sink an entire hostile fleet. Ensuring we've got the best naval fighters will give us a great advantage."

CCN_Carriers:0 "Modern Carrier Designs"
CCN_Carriers_desc:0 "Bigger carriers with more deck space is the omega, the end, of the carrier development. Such a ship would be the epitome of naval warfare."
CCN_Heavy_Cruisers:0 "Heavy Cruiser Designs"
CCN_Heavy_Cruisers_desc:0 "Battleships, while no doubt impressive, still need support from their smaller sisters. Heavy cruisers not only provide anti-air support, but also bring main armament to match the might of the battleship."
CCN_Battlecruisers:0 "Battlecruisers Designs"
CCN_Battlecruisers_desc:0 "Even with the impressive combination of firepower from both heavy cruisers and battleships, there still needs to be something in the middle to fill the place of either of the other two if they are otherwise unavailable. A Battlecruiser."
CCN_Battleships:0 "Battleship Designs"
CCN_Battleships_desc:0 "The final form of the battleship is the image most imagine. Heavy armour, huge guns, and with enough size to send any lesser enemy retreating back to their home port."
CCN_Marine_Operations:0 "Marine Tactics"
CCN_Marine_Operations_desc:0 "The development of amphibious troops designed to attack enemies where no land path is possible is something that should be focused on, as the advantage it would deliver is beyond immeasurable."

thoraxian.1.t:0 "The Thoraxian Betrayal"
thoraxian.1.d:0 "With supporters for harmony and friendship growing larger and larger within the hives scattered across changeling lands, it was only time before those upstarts thought themselves too good for the strength and unity of the Queen. Thorax and his supporters, as well as numerous detractors of Chrysalis, have all united under the banner of 'harmony'.\n\nNumerous hives in Volistad, Antax, and Soryth have pledged their allegiance to Thorax, embracing the values of harmony, friendship, and peace."
thoraxian.1.a:0 "We shall embrace harmony!"
thoraxian.1.b:0 "We will come for you soon enough, traitors."
thoraxian.2.t:0 "The Raid on Schloss Trimmel!"
thoraxian.2.d:0 "Put Cool Story Here"
thoraxian.2.a:0 "Trimmel survived and is calling for Thorax to be deposed!"
thoraxian.2.b:0 "Trimmel and his subordinates have been terminated."
thoraxian.3.t:0 "Trimmelite Coup"
thoraxian.3.d:0 "Put Cool Story Here"
thoraxian.3.a:0 "Sieg Trimmel!" # FUHRER TRIMMEL
thoraxian.4.t:0 "Changelings Offer Pact"
thoraxian.4.d:0 "The Changelings offer a non-aggression pact, it's quite clear from diplomatic talks that they will seek ally us and bring down The Lunar Empire."
thoraxian.4.a:0 "We could accept."
thoraxian.4.b:0 "We don't negotiate with bugs in Olenia." # Typical Johan doesn't want to save the world with us
thoraxian.5.t:0 "[OLE.GetName] Accepts"
thoraxian.5.d:0 "Olenia has accepted our offer!"
thoraxian.5.a:0 "Excellent."
thoraxian.6.t:0 "Olenia Declines"
thoraxian.6.d:0 "Those filthy Olenians have declined our offer."
thoraxian.6.a:0 "Why can't we be friends?"
thoraxian.7.t:0 "[CCN.GetName] and [Root.GetName] form the Duskian Concordat"
thoraxian.7.d:0 "This morning [GetDateText] [CCN.GetLeader] and [OLE.GetLeader] both meet in the city hall of Vaverfront to sign a mutual defensive pact between their nations, forming what some have begun to call the Duskian Concordat."
thoraxian.7.a:0 "Together into the breach!"
thoraxian.8.t:0 "Changeling Alliance"
thoraxian.8.d:0 "We have received an offer from the King of the Changelings, he seeks to bring down the Tyrants in the south and promises us a fair share of Equestria if we throw in our support."
thoraxian.8.a:0 "While it pains us to cooperate with bourgeois scum, we accept."
thoraxian.8.b:0 "Why would we work with them they are no better then the tyrant in the south! Refuse their outrageous offer."
thoraxian.9.t:0 "Stalliongrad Accepted"
thoraxian.9.d:0 "One more for team Thorax!"
thoraxian.9.a:0 "Excellent."
thoraxian.10.t:0 "Stalliongrad Declined"
thoraxian.10.d:0 "Stalliongrad has refused your generous offer and has cited it is a 'doomed endeavour'"
thoraxian.10.a:0 "Maybe Trimmel was right about those communists..." # Someone may feel bad if they killed Trimmel at this point?
thoraxian.11.t:0 "Changeling Alliance"
thoraxian.11.d:0 "We have received an offer from the King of the Changelings, he seeks to bring down the Tyrants in the south citing it will be the greatest battle to ever happen, how could the Yaks of all species miss such a glorious event?"
thoraxian.11.a:0 "Yes."
thoraxian.11.b:0 "Ye- I mean no!"
thoraxian.12.t:0 "Yaks Accepted"
thoraxian.12.d:0 "Like they would have missed a good fight."
thoraxian.12.a:0 "Another one for team Thorax."
thoraxian.13.t:0 "Yaks Refuse"
thoraxian.13.d:0 "The Yaks of Yakyakistan apparently torn apart our treaty after looking it over, its safe to assume they they will not assist us in the upcoming war."
thoraxian.13.a:0 "Its like they all want to be enslaved by ponies or something..."
thoraxian.14.t:0 "Queen Velvet returns to Olenia with Changeling Backing"
thoraxian.14.d:0 "With the backing of Thorax and his changelings, Queen Velvet has returned from her exile in Equestria, and intends to claim the throne of Olenia as its rightful heir. Supporters of Velvet are already mobilising, and clashing in the streets with those loyal to Johan and his regime.\n\nIt's now up to those fighting to determine the future of Olenia."
thoraxian.14.a:0 "Bah! I'm the rightful ruler of Olenia!"
thoraxian.14.b:0 "The true Queen has returned! Hail Velvet!"
thoraxian.15.t:0 "Marriage Offer"
thoraxian.15.d:0 "After numerous nights together, Thorax and Velvet have grown close over the past few weeks after her successful installation as the rightful monarch of the Kingdom of Olenia, and it was tonight that Thorax proposed to Velvet. Offering to not only bring their nations closer in alliance, but also to bring themselves closer in the bonds of matrimony, as both King and Queen."
thoraxian.15.a:0 "I accept, I will get my best dress!"
thoraxian.15.b:0 "I refuse, but we can still remain allies."
thoraxian.16.t:0 "Velvet accepted!"
thoraxian.16.d:0 "Velvet was wooed by Thorax's boldness, and agreed to marriage. The ceremony was uneventful, but still celebrated across the two nations with joy from the citizens. Older deer and changeling reacted with suspicion, citing prior rivalry and hatred between the two nations, but those times are over now."
thoraxian.16.a:0 "Till death do us part..."
thoraxian.17.t:0 "Velvet refused but insisted we remain just allies"
thoraxian.17.d:0 "Ouch."
thoraxian.17.a:0 "Oh... okay."
thoraxian.18.t:0 "Capital of the Commonwealth"
thoraxian.18.d:0 "With the unification of Olenia and the Changeling Lands as the Olenian-Changeling Commonwealth, a decision has to be made regarding the capital. While continuing to rule from Vesalipolis is the easiest to justify, considering it's where changelings have ruled from for nearly all time, arguments have to be made for moving the capital to the Olenian capital in Hjortland.\n\nAlternatively, arguments have been made for moving the capital to two of the Olenian and Changeling's biggest cities, Vaverfront and Vraks. While not as significant historically as the two current capitals, moving it to one of the other two may bring a sense of unity to the newly formed commonwealth."
thoraxian.18.a:0 "Vesalipolis."
thoraxian.18.b:0 "Hjortland." # DIRECT RULE FROM HJORTLAND!
thoraxian.18.c:0 "Vaverfront."
thoraxian.18.e:0 "Vraks."
thoraxian.19.t:0 "Propose Unification"
thoraxian.19.d:0 "With Thorax and Velvet's dynasties united in marriage, Thorax has made a proposal. Just as Thorax and Velvet are united, why not unite Olenia and the Changeling Lands under one flag, one banner, as a diarchal system? Not only will it bring two races who have had conflicts closer together, but it'll help unite the land and bring about more friendship and harmony."
thoraxian.19.a:0 "Olenian-Changeling Commonwealth."
thoraxian.19.b:0 "We should stay separate countries."
thoraxian.20.t:0 "Velvet refused the Union"
thoraxian.20.d:0 "Despite all that the changelings and the deer have been through in recent history, Queen Velvet has regrettably declined the offer to unify both the Changeling Lands and the Kingdom of Olenia."
thoraxian.20.a:0 "Oh... okay"
thoraxian.21.t:0 "Keisari Thorax" #IRC everyone is just gonna choose Velvet even myself
thoraxian.21.d:0 "In spite of the years of differences of the two nations, Queen Velvet has decided to unite the changelings and the deer as one nation under the diarchal rule of the married duo. As of this moment forward, King Thorax is now Keisari Thorax, and both Olenia and the Changeling Lands are the Olenian-Changeling Commonwealth!"
thoraxian.21.a:0 "Keisarinna Velvet Jelzek!" #remember to change last name if we ever agree on an Olenian Dynasty name in Politburo Psody
thoraxian.21.b:0 "Keisari Thorax Jelzek!" #remember to change last name if we ever agree on an Olenian Dynasty name in Politburo Psody
thoraxian.22.t:0 "Changelings Seek Non Aggression Pact"
thoraxian.22.d:0 "We have recently received a diplomatic offer from the new government of the Changeling Lands lead by Thorax. After explaining that the new government wanted to distance itself from the previous acts of aggression perpetrated by the changelings, an offer of an official non-aggression pact between our two nations to solidify our new relationship was presented to us."
thoraxian.22.a:0 "Of course, we will accept. For peace and prosperity!"
thoraxian.22.b:0 "This has to be some sort of changeling trick! "
thoraxian.23.t:0 "Equestria Accepted!"
thoraxian.23.d:0 "After a short period of waiting, we have finally received a reply from Equestria! Along with the official signing of the non-aggression pact, we received a letter from Princess Celestia herself stating that this pact will hopefully put an end to the dreadful history of conflict between our nations."
thoraxian.23.a:0 "We will put the mistakes of the past behind us"
thoraxian.24.t:0 "Equestria Refused?"
thoraxian.24.d:0 "According to an envoy from Equestria, our offer of a non-aggression pact between our two nations has been rejected? We received no official reason for this rejection and are left quite puzzled by the Equestrian reaction."
thoraxian.24.a:0 "Wait they said no?"
thoraxian.25.t:0 "Coronation of [CCN.GetLeader]"
thoraxian.25.d:0 "This morning [GetDateText] [CCN.GetLeader] was crowned ruler of the Olenian-Changeling Commonwealth. At the opening of today's thousand-year-old rite the Allsherjargoði presented [CCN.GetLeader] to the citizens of both countries as their "undoubted Ruler", that is by holy right. Three hours later they went forth from the coronation event, amid the greatest rejoicing, a crowned and consecrated Monarch. No such delight has hailed a Sovereign's Coronation before."
thoraxian.25.a:0 "Interesting..."
thoraxian.26.t:0 "The Keisarinna's Plan"
thoraxian.26.d:0 "Keisarinna Velvet's Plan for the settlement of northern Olenia is in full swing, and it is a great success, providing living space for many deer and changelings. The vast, empty Olenian lands can now finally be used to their full potential!"
thoraxian.26.a:0 "Fantastic!"
thoraxian.27.t:0 "The Assuttamien Plan Continues"
thoraxian.27.d:0 "The Kaiserin's plan continues at full speed. The various towns and villages dotted around northern Olenia have steadily expanded into larger and more prosperous communities. Roads and buildings are starting to cover the previously empty vastness of Olenia, and the economic potential of these regions continues to grow."
thoraxian.27.a:0 "Excellent!"
thoraxian.28.t:0 "The Assuttamien Plan Is Complete!"
thoraxian.28.d:0 "The final stages of the Assuttamien plan were completed in the last few weeks, and northern Olenia has truly started to transform. The many towns and villages covering the landscape are slowly merging into cities, and problems between the deer and changelings seem like distant memories to the inhabitants of the vast northern expanses of Olenia."
thoraxian.28.a:0 "Fantastic!"
thoraxian.29.t:0 "Olenian Civil War Intervention"
thoraxian.29.d:0 "After pledging our own support to Queen Velvet's cause, it's our time to shine, and bring back harmony by helping Velvet to take down Johan. Our forces stand ready, and willing to help Velvet reclaim her rightful place as the harmonious Queen."
thoraxian.35.t:0 "Changeling Demands"
thoraxian.35.d:0 "During a meeting with one of the ambassadors of the changelings, it was made clear to us that they expect us to hold a referendum for those "harmony" supporters soon. The UFPR has grown in popularity ever since the changelings started to cozy up to Equestria, and now command a significant amount of support from our citizens. If we accept the referendum we might open the door to further changeling interference in our government, but refusing might have other consequences."
thoraxian.35.a:0 "We have no choice, hold the referendum."
thoraxian.35.b:0 "We can't cave into changeling demands that easily!"
thoraxian.36.t:0 "The Bears Accept!"
thoraxian.36.d:0 "The polar bears have accepted our generous offer, and Harmony now reigns in the Polar Bear Communities. The UFPR has requested our aid in transitioning their society to truly embrace harmony, and who are we to refuse such an offer."
thoraxian.36.a:0 "Excellent!"
thoraxian.37.t:0 "The Bears Refuse!"
thoraxian.37.d:0 "It seems that our offer did not go over well with [PLB.GetLeader], and was rejected by the Polar bears. In an official statement, Paw said that further changeling interference in the politics of the Polar bear communities would not be tolerated. It seems we might have to take other measures to establish harmony in the Polar bear communities."
thoraxian.37.a:0 "An unwise decision on their part."
thoraxian.38.t:0 "An Offer From The Changelings"
thoraxian.38.d:0 "The changelings have recently started to pressure us to hold a referendum for the supporters of Harmony within Yakyakistan.[From.GetLeader] is wary of accepting the offer, as the changelings have established very close ties with the Yakitan Liberal Nam, and there is no telling what they might do after the referendum."
thoraxian.38.a:0 "We must accept."
thoraxian.38.b:0 "We will not bow to their demands."
thoraxian.39.t:0 "The Yaks Accept."
thoraxian.39.d:0 "Yakyakistan recently held a referendum for their harmony supporters, and our good friends the in the Yakitan Liberal Nam have come out on top. Naturally, we must provide aid to the Yaks, both economically and politically. "
thoraxian.39.a:0 "Fantastic news!"
thoraxian.40.t:0 "The Yaks Refuse"
thoraxian.40.d:0 "It seems that our demands did not go over well with [From.GetLeader], and our offer was rejected by Yakyakistan. After this small setback, it might be necessary to pursue other options in bringing harmony to the Yaks."
thoraxian.40.a:0 "Unfortunate"
thoraxian.41.t:0 "A Change of Doctrine"
thoraxian.41.d:0 "With the integration of Olenia as our partner, we now have two choices of military doctrine; theirs, or ours. While our forces, overall, make up a greater portion of the army, and thus, it would be far easier to restructure their army then to do so with ours, there is also the possibility of exploring our partner's doctrinal warplan. After all, the world has already seen our might and experience in the civil war which cast the tyrant Chrysalis down. What shall we go with?"
thoraxian.41.a:0 "The tried and tested! The Changeling way!"
thoraxian.41.b:0 "The deer's way of thinking holds interesting possibilities."
thoraxian.41.b_tt:0 "Changes race to §YDeer§!.\nChanges racial technologies to §Ydeer technologies§!.\nTransfers all racial technologies researched by §YKingdom of Olenia§!.\n§RRemoves all changeling racial technologies.§!"

 ### Ideas ###
 LAK_dying_culture:0 "Ruiniad"
 LAK_dying_culture_desc:0 "Ruiniad or the Ruination is a term coined by Rumarean scholars to describe the gradual decline of the Rumarean language, culture and traditions.\n\nNo griffon is quite certain how or when it started, but the cultures more predominant in the Griffonian Empire have started to eclipse the native traditions. Some theorized this is due to immigration and simple convenience in international trade.  Regardless of the cause, the numbers speak for themselves, as barely 30% of Rumare's population still speak their native language. Even the most optimistic academics predict it is but matter of time until our culture goes truly extinct and the Ruiniad is complete."

 LAK_cultural_schools_desc:0 "In order to secure our language we must make sure it remains being taught in schools.

For we must ask that great question of endangered nations. If our children do not learn, who lives, who dies, who tells our story?"
 LAK_dual_languages:0 "Linguistic Pluralism"
 LAK_dual_languages_desc:0 "In order to secure our place in the world we must embrace the pragmatic use of language. We will make Imperial Griffish a secondary language of the state, and allow people to speak Aquileian or Wingbardian as well if they so please."

 LAK_economic_hotspot:0 "The Griffonian Tax Haven"
 LAK_economic_hotspot_desc:0 "The Baron has recently had dinner with a rich Imperial investor who proposed a deal to Alaric, he would finance a new tourist industry in Rumare if only the Baron would slash the corporate tax rate. And he assures us he has friends who would be just as grateful."
 LAK_welcome_the_diaspora:0 "Welcome the Diaspora"
 LAK_welcome_the_diaspora_desc:0 "When the Empire rose under Grover I, we were some of the first to be subjugated. The Rumarean people endured for long, but soon the destruction of our culture and the abuse of our land began to push citizens away. We can now begin to reverse this process by showing our people that Rumare is once more prosperous and free!"
 LAK_a_safe_haven:0 "Sefydliad Brawdoliaeth Ddiwylliannol y Rumare"
 LAK_a_safe_haven_desc:0 "The Duke has now begun to argue for the creation of the Rumare Cultural Fraud Institute, a government system that will vet all Immigrants to Rumare and grant preference to ethnic Rumareans, it will also have a cash fund to support education and minor welfare for these new immigrants as well, this shall surely increase the flow of Griffons to our Baronry."

 LAK_realpolitik:0 "What Must Be Done"
 LAK_realpolitik_desc:0 "While we have decided we must restore our nation we have not quite decided how to do that yet. While avid nationalists wish to go on a crusade to reclaim our land, more pragmatic Griffons at court would have us bide our time for when the moment may be more suited, and possibly join a greater power in order to get back our birthright."
 LAK_subisides_families:0 "Encourage Large Families"
 LAK_subisides_families_desc:0 "One of the causes of Rumarean decline was the simple fact there were not enough Rumarean Griffons. We must make sure this never happens again by offering tax incentives and state encouragements for Griffons to have more children then they previously would have been able to."
 LAK_support_businesses:0 "Support Local Businesses"
 LAK_support_businesses_desc:0 "One way to preserve Rumarean culture is to preserve its native laborers. We can provide incentives for the hiring of native Rumareans both on our island, and maybe even some to draw in Laborers from across the pond to Griffonstone... "

 LAK_investors_desc:0 "We can set up a slight loophole in our law code to allow companies to set up Rumarean branch offices for them to gain access to our new tax breaks, provided they only provide jobs to good hardworking Rumareans that is."
 LAK_the_cultural_bund:0 "Frenhines Ddiwylliannol"
 LAK_the_cultural_bund_desc:0 "Rumarean exists as a unique cultural anomaly in the world, and this can be used to our advantage. Since unlike the Imperials the Aquelians or the Wingbardians, we have no outstanding cultural battles with others around us, or at least we lost the ones we started... But besides that point, because of this we can make ourselves a home of diplomacy, conferences, summits and treaty dinners alike!"
 LAK_use_the_diaspora:0 "Summon the Diaspora"
 LAK_use_the_diaspora_desc:0 "It is now time to strike a call to arms for Rumareans across the world, that soon the ancestral lands shall be free, and that they must return to prepare for that day.

 LAK_a_patron:0 "Better to Serve..."
 LAK_a_patron_desc:0 "It is all at a head now. In order to regain our land we must sign treaties with those who we know can help us to get it back. Unequal or not we shall be reunited with our people, and this is truly the goal."

 LAK_call_in_the_favours:0 "Call in Some Favors"
 LAK_call_in_the_favours_desc:0 "The Baron's old days as a Mercenary will finally help his Baronry out, as he has gotten in touch with an ethnic Rumarean living in Karthin, who says he can get us weapons for our liberation. It may not be much, but any guns are more to shoot at the slaveholders in Griffonstone"
 LAK_the_free_rumare_army:0 "Byddin Rhyddid o Rumare"
 LAK_the_free_rumare_army_desc:0 "The response to the Baron's call have been at the very least shocking. We have received Baronless letters from ethnic Rumareans held in the Griffonstone territories who have declared their willingness to fight for their freedom. We must begin to organize these resistance fighters into an official network lead by actual officers. And one day they will be able to fight!"
 LAK_the_pipeline:0 "The Pipeline"
 LAK_the_pipeline_desc:0 "The Baron's old friend has come through once more. He knows of a corrupt fisher boss on the edge of the Lake who would be more than willing to accept money in exchange for turning a blind eye to weapons shipments marked as *beauty products*"
 LAK_a_few_gaps:0 "A Couple of Gaps"
 LAK_a_few_gaps_desc:0 "Even while the Baron's friend was able to supply our standing army with arms at first, his efforts have been shifted to ensuring the success of our liberation.

 LAK_home_sweet_home_desc:0 "We are now reunited with our homeland and it is time to get to work. Along with restoring our national pride we have been able to seize research centers and industrial production which will help immensely with the battle to come.\n\nBecause now we just have to hold on to what we got from the tyrants."
 LAK_repair_the_shrines:0 "Repair the Shrines"

 LAK_a_proper_army_desc:0 "We have now restored our native land, and with it we have inherited its freedom fighters. We shall use these veterans, combined with our established officer corps to forge a New Rumaran army capable of defending our new state. Byddin wedi'i bedyddio gan dân."

 LAK_never_again_desc:0 "With our army set we can get them to work on the Baron's great project.

 LAK_cultural_institute:0 "The Cultural Preservation Society"
 LAK_cultural_institute_desc:0 "In regaining our land we have also once more come into possession of ancient cultural artifacts hidden throughout the nation. By opening a new university to study these and other aspects of our old culture we can kill two unicorns with one stone and enhance our research and resurrect our culture further."
 LAK_support_rumarean_businesses:0 "Repatriation Programs"
 LAK_support_rumarean_businesses_desc:0 "The Industry and commerce of our new lands have been controlled by foreign industrial tyrants from Griffenheim and Griffonstone for far too long. We can further encourage immigration and growth by returning to the native Rumarean people what are rightfully their land and profits."

 LAK_the_rebirth_desc:0 "Oh glorious Rumare, we stand ready to fight for thee, through bloody day, and chilling night we never abandoned thee, for now the dawn comes on another bloody day, but today shall not be the day of our blood, but of those who would have made us bleed."
 
 LAK_industry_technology:0 "The Jewel Of The Lake"
 LAK_industry_technology_desc:0 "Rumare was once a treasured jewel of Griffonkind, and home to the great people of Rumare. With his affairs in order, Alaric is now focusing on making Rumare the precious jewel it once was."

 LAK_support_fishing_industry_desc:0 "Rumare's fishing industry supplies fresh food to the duchies in the heartland, the Aquileians to the west and to Wingbardy to the south, the lake is by far the largest commercial industry we have and we must ensure it's continual growth."
 LAK_protectionist_policies:0 "Officialise Workers' Rights Legislature"
 LAK_protectionist_policies_desc:0 "In the past, the workers of Rumare have had a few rights and favorable dealings with industry, though on the whole, this has never been formalized. Doing so now will help to draw more workers, and keep our quality and capability on the up and up."
 LAK_construction_schemes:0 "The Village Expansion Act"
 LAK_construction_schemes_desc:0 "While, of course, land is always at a premium on the island on the lake, we probably still have room for new Rumarean villages to settle on the shoreside, if we can attract them to do so."
 LAK_trade_offices:0 "The Rumare Chamber Of Commerce"
 LAK_trade_offices_desc:0 "Rumare has, historically, never been all that centralized, despite the small amount of land available to it. However, with Alaric's return, he seeks to change that. A centralized chamber of commerce is a good first step towards doing such."
 LAK_invest_in_tourism:0 "Invest In Tourism"
 LAK_invest_in_tourism_desc:0 "While some notables have expressed their confusion towards Alaric's plan of opening Rumare up to tourism. However, Alaric's response was a simple one: a burgeoning tourist industry will keep people's opinions of Rumare high, and give would-be invaders some pause before attacking possibly their own civilians."
 LAK_domestic_oil_industry:0 "Shale Oil"
 LAK_domestic_oil_industry_desc:0 "While not exactly a conventional method of producing oil, Shale Oil production is the only easy means for Rumare to obtain oil, at the moment, and thus must be exploited for all it's worth."
 LAK_invest_in_the_people:0 "Invest In The People"
 LAK_invest_in_the_people_desc:0 "Alongside his economic reforms, Alaric also has made a point of expressing the necessity of investing into Rumare's citizens as well. By instituting a national education program, we can more than just invest in our people, but raise them to new unknown standards of living."
 LAK_economic_prosperity:0 "A Prosperous Little Nation"
 LAK_economic_prosperity_desc:0 "With plenty of time to institute all his reforms, Alaric has rebuilt Rumare's economy from the ground up. Bringing the Rumarean people into unheard of prosperity, ready to face the challenges of the new world before them."

 LAK_army_reform:0 "The Gwarchodlu Cenedlaethol"
 LAK_army_reform_desc:0 "To call what we currently have available troop-wise an army is more of a bad joke than a state of fact. Thus, we should begin formation of a National Guard group to start expansion of our armed forces."
 LAK_focus_on_defence:0 "To Serve And Protect"
 LAK_focus_on_defence_desc:0 "Our army has for decades been a force for the defense of the Rumarean people. Alaric sees no reason to change that, and has thus ordered his small cadre of officers to pursue this line of thought in regards to planning for battle."
 LAK_focus_on_offence:0 "Fire And Brimstone"
 LAK_focus_on_offence_desc:0 "In the past, our army was solely a defensive one. However, Alaric's experiences as a mercenary have shown him that defense is not always the best way to go. As such, he has begun to teach his generals the might of modern weapons, such as artillery, and the machine gun. Something that will change the way Rumare wages war forever."
 LAK_fortify_the_islands:0 "The Recimir Line"
 LAK_fortify_the_islands_desc:0 "Named after Alaric's father, the departed Baron Recimir Dawnbreaker, the new Recimir line will be a testament to the defensive prowess of Rumare. With new, and modernized fortifications making land invasion even more unfeasible than in the olden days, and interlocking firing positions ready to reap a toll on any besieger."
 LAK_local_armouries:0 "Local Armouries"
 LAK_local_armouries_desc:0 "If we are to be able to properly defend ourselves, we must be able to readily manufacture our own weapons, rather than rely on foreign imports all the time.

 LAK_build_air_defences:0 "Clear Blue Skies"
 LAK_build_air_defences_desc:0 "If we are to keep Rumare safe, we must also take into account the modern invention of the aircraft. Though we don't necessarily have any suitable weapons to defeat such vehicles, we can easily import a few batteries to keep our skies safe from enemy planes. Rumare will have nothing but clear blue skies in it's future."
 LAK_focus_on_recruitment:0 "Every Soul Counts"
 LAK_focus_on_recruitment_desc:0 "If we are going to keep our defenses strong, we must make sure that every available soul capable of firing a weapon serves at least some sort of military service. To this end, we will offer good wages to draw in conscripts, and make use of some 'less than polite' conscription methods to bolster our forces as necessary."
 LAK_old_friends:0 "Old Friends"
 LAK_old_friends_desc:0 "In the past, Alaric Dawnbreaker made a living for himself amongst several griffon mercenary bands roaming the continent. Though he is now the leader of Rumare, he still has access to some of his contacts, and can draw on their expertise to train his own army- for the right price, of course."
 LAK_old_connections:0 "Underground Contacts"
 LAK_old_connections_desc:0 "Aside from his mercenary contacts, Alaric has a few... less than legal contacts in the weapons smuggling line of trade. Whilst not really that dependable or respectable, we can still make use of them once or twice so as to bolster our army's available equipment, thereby taking pressure off our weapons manufacturers."
 LAK_invest_in_new_rifles:0 "Modernise The Equipment"
 LAK_invest_in_new_rifles_desc:0 "While our old equipment is still usable, and will going forward still be available for use by our home defense units, we should make strides to modernize our rifles and cannons, so as to have a technological edge over any future enemies we may have."
 LAK_newest_artillery_pieces:0 "Import Imperial Artillery Pieces"
 LAK_newest_artillery_pieces_desc:0 "The Imperial artillery corps is considered one of the best equipped and drilled artillery teams on the Griffon continent. We should both make use of their technical expertise and their impressive technologies themselves."
 LAK_train_officers:0 "Secondary Combat Roles"
 LAK_train_officers_desc:0 "Something that should be taught to Rumare's generals, so as to keep up with the changing, modern battlefield, are the secondary combat roles. While not direct combatants themselves, logisticians and planning boards are important to any present-day military, and should be both respected and made use of."
 LAK_focus_on_training:0 "Quality Over Quantity"
 LAK_focus_on_training_desc:0 "While having hordes of troops at our command can be considered a good thing, it is Alaric's professional opinion as a former mercenary himself that a few well-trained griffons with better equipment and drills can hold out more readily against the poorly trained peasant masses, and the Rumarean military agrees with his assertion."
 LAK_nationalist_fervour:0 "Nationalist Fervour"
 LAK_nationalist_fervour_desc:0 "With our military reformed and ready to fight, we should drum up our national fervor, and instill a sense of pride into the Rumarean people and military. Who knows, we may even get more volunteers out of it, in the end."
 
 LAK_airforce:0 "The Wawr Airstrip"
 LAK_airforce_desc:0 "While the aeroplane is a relatively new technology, and though most of our citizens are capable of flight, Alaric has expressed his intentions to build Rumare's first Aircraft specific airstrip, for use in future military endeavours."
 LAK_acquire_fighters:0 "Acquire Fighters"
 LAK_acquire_fighters_desc:0 "Rumare itself has no aircraft industry yet, though there is no reason we can't import a few craft and begin looking into new designs."
 LAK_acquire_bombers:0 "A Few Old Bombers"
 LAK_acquire_bombers_desc:0 "Though Rumare has never looked into a bomber aircraft before, there is no reason not to, now that Alaric has built his airstrip. We can begin by importing a few older designs from abroad, and adapting them for our own use."
 LAK_formal_airforce:0 "Create The RAF"
 LAK_formal_airforce_desc:0 "Christened the First Rumarean Air Force by Alaric, these wildcat pilots comprised of former mercenaries, expatriates, and daring Rumarean military personnel are fervent in their defense of their homeland of Rumare, and always looking for new and improved ways to defend it."
 LAK_radar_station:0 "Adopt The RADAR"
 LAK_radar_station_desc:0 "An invention from abroad, the RADAR system will be invaluable to both our pilots and anti-aircraft guns in defending Rumare, making it possible for them to locate enemy fighters long before they arrive in our airspace. As well, the system may have uses on the ground that we can explore further."
 
 ### Events ###
 dawn.1.t:0 "The New Baron"
 dawn.1.d:0 "Alaric paced back and forth on the deck of the small boat crossing the misty lake. His father was dead and he must return home to take charge of Rumare himself. His income as A mercenary had been one of the primary sources of income for Rumare and had acBaroned for 26% of total revenue marked as *Birthday Gifts* in the Barony's ledger. But that was not the only thing that worried him. For he was in outlaw in Griffonstone, and he was on the edge of legal status in Arantiga from which he had taken this boat. And it took the last coins in his pocket to get a port guard to look the other way.\n\nBut at last he saw something, a shape, a ship is taking form on the horizon... he readied his weapon but soon saw something unusual, the ship simply threw down a rope, of which his transport tied to their bow, and then began to slip into the haze. He was safe now. But now the question of how to rule...\n\nHis father had always dreamed of bringing the lands of the Rumarean people back under his wing, but as he saw the conditions of his home as he slipped into the harbor under cover... he seriously considered turning his back on those ideas.\n\nWhat is a Griffon to do?"
 dawn.1.a:0 "We must save what can be saved..."
 dawn.1.b:0 "Yma o Hyd!"
 
 dawn.2.t:0 "The Dual Language Act"
 dawn.2.d:0 "Alaric sat at his desk in the Baron's manor with a paper sitting in front of him. But he could not read it. He was a literate griffon of course, he could read 4 languages and speak 3 fluently but this was in the Imperial language, something his father had shunned for long, and had tried and failed to root our of his land. He flipped to the back and thankfully found a translation written in Rumarean and began to ponder what he was about to do. To make Imperial an official language was an ultimate capitulation. But one must first kneel to be able to stand back up."
 dawn.2.a:0 "Times are changing..."
 
 dawn.3.t:0 "The Return of the Diaspora"
 dawn.3.d:0 "Today thousands of native Rumareans would step back on Ruamrean shores again. And there will soon be many more!"
 dawn.3.a:0 "Welcome home!"
 
 dawn.4.t:0 "The Rumarean Language Act"
 dawn.4.d:0 "By decree of his majesty the Baron of Rumare and all Rumareans in diaspora he decrees,\n\nAll government texts in Rumare shall be written in the lounge of the fathers.\nAll public signs made by the state shall be in, exclusively Rumarean.\nAll of those in the Barony who can not speak Rumarean shall be provided an opportunity to, failing to accept will result in a fee.\nAnd most importantly. All children are banned from having the name "Grover""
 dawn.4.a:0 "Yma o Hyd..."
 
 dawn.5.t:0 "The Free Rumare Army"
 dawn.5.d:0 "There are many enthnic Rumareans living in the Residence and Stone Highlands. They usually don't cause any trouble but this has changed recently with the formation of the Free Rumare Army, a organisation which claims to be fighting for a independent Rumarean nation. The formation of the FRA has coincided with the bombing of several government facilities in the Residence and Stone Highlands that has caused significant damage. More worringly is the discovery of several weapons caches in a raid by the army on a FRA hideout. It seems the FRA is also preparing for a full scale uprising.\n\nWhile we have been unable to track down the source of funding for the FRA. Many are suspecting the Barony of Rumare to be the ones smuggling weapons and funds to the FRA. However without any solid evidence we cannot do anything. The only thing we can do is wait for them to strike first."
 dawn.5.a:0 "Terrorists the lot of them!"
 
 dawn.6.t:0 "The Return of the Old Gods"
 dawn.6.d:0 "Alaric was deep in the forests on the most secluded area on the island of Rumare, these lands were sacred to him and his people, and he came here daily for some sort of religious event. Some were more enjoyable then others, the worst being to the god of knowledge Ymenydd, and the best being either the god of games or well... let's say the god of "indulgence" to be polite.\n\nBut today was special. It was the feast of Arcturius, the god stolen from them by the Imperials and desecrated by their false shrines. He had had an ancient artifact imported from his new lands, a spear with which Arcurius slew the great Maaw, which threatened to consume all Griffonkind. And so he sat and prayed, prayed for the deliverance of his people."
 dawn.6.a:0 "Praise be to Arcturius!"
 
 dawn.7.t:0 "The Return of the Language"
 dawn.7.d:0 "Alaric read his reports and smiled. He read of book clubs and social groups. Of sports teams and workshops. And of restaurants and taverns. But most importantly to him, he read these things in Rumarean and read about Rumareans. It was, for the first time in the reign of him, his father, or many fathers before that, growing. More Griffons began to speak their ancestral lounge, and it showed. The Ruiniad had turned into a rebirth for his people. And he could not be more proud."
 dawn.7.a:0 "Yma o Hyd!"
 
 dawn.8.t:0 "The Return of the Diaspora"
 dawn.8.d:0 "Alaric watched from a boat in the lake as any more boats like it docked in the harbor of their great new land. They were his people, his comrades and yet he felt a tinge of pain. For he had made an oath and he would not yet step on those shores himself. His people asked them to simply sail forth and go with them, but he still had work to do.\n\nHe still had to make his Baronry proud to be Rumarean."
 dawn.8.a:0 "Welcome home!"

 dawn.9.d:0 ""Once again today! I present to you all, citizens of the liberated lands of Rumare! Your Baron and liberator, Alaric Dawnbreaker!"\n\nIt was a moment of redemption for Alaric. For so many years he had gone off, fighting other's wars, killing Griffons, Ponies and even Zebras alike. Battle after battle, payment after payment, bloody dawn after bloody dawn. All to one day return home and achieve what his father couldn't.\n\nHis father\n\nArcturius bless him... he wished he could see this day. To see the people clap and cheer, to exclaim his praises for giving them true freedom from the tyranny of the oppressors.\n\nThis moment might have even been cathartic if it wasn't for the lack of his father's grey wing around him. But even as he put on a smiling face for the crowd, and even as he sulked inside, he noticed a light shining from far away, a light emanating from the top of the Griffonstone Mountain, the location of Arcturias' great pantheon. And he knew his father was home."

 dawn.10.d:0 "Many fishergriffs see our support for the industry as the actions of a government that actually apperciates the work of the common griffion and we have gained the grudging approval of several prominent Fisher Barons who have ensured suitable 'protection' for their new friends with the understanding of what our new 'soldiers' will do if our support wavers."

 dawn.11.d:0 "With the increase in the number of local businesses the local unemployment rate has fallen to nearly unheard of lows. This has resulted in a spike in collective bargaining as both Employers and Employees have realised that the power balence has swung to the workers as in this new market, a skilled worker can always find a new job but a stingy employer may not be able to find someone to take his place."

 dawn.13.d:0 "During the night a pony from the Federation stumbled out of Darcy's Pub and Grill and spent the morning screaming racial epithets at everyone she met before passing out on a bench she had vomited over. She was quickly arrested but her actions have caused quite the uproar in the community. She will be deported after a short trial,  but her actions will be discussed between pub patrons and politicans alike."

 ### General desc ###
 welsh_sheepfucker_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: August 18th, 965 in Rumare\n\n§YRank§!: Cyffredinol\n\n§YBiography§!: Born in Rumare in 965 to an Imperial Officer and a local Rumarean fishergriff, Graid spent the first years of his chickhood in comfortable living, as the small island barony was mostly devoid of the conflict and troubles which plagued Griffonia even before the collapse of the Empire. He would spend these years either playing in the grassy fields of the island or in his education, which his father ensured was focused on the history of Griffonia and the Empire.\n\nThis changed in 978, when the Republican Revolution struck the Empire. As Imperial authority disappeared overnight, Rumare gained de-facto independence; however this didn’t sit well with his father, who remained loyal to Griffenheim. As a result, twelve year old Graid would be uprooted from his home, as his father moved his family to the Herzlands and joined the Imperial loyalists against Kemerskai’s revolutionaries. After Grover V was restored to the throne, Graid’s father decided to stay in Griffenheim, as he was promoted due to his loyalty to the Imperials. His education on the Empire’s history and glory was doubled down, and now included the teaching of Herzlander language and literature, displacing his native Rumarean.\n\nAfter coming of age, Graid was enrolled in the Vinnin Military Academy, graduating four years latter in 987 as an infantry officer. The climate of social chaos and decay in the Empire following the Revolution made him feel unhappy, and he began to look at his chickhood in Rumare with a certain sense of nostalgia. As a result, he focused himself on his free time to learning of Rumare’s history, culture and literature; increasing his fondness for his birthplace. He eventually resigned his officer commission from the Reichsarmee after eleven years of service and promptly moved back to Rumare. After writing a Rumarean language novel in 1001 - which wasn’t very successful - he made a request to Baron Recimir to join as an officer of the small Rumare Defense Force, which was accepted.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Riley"

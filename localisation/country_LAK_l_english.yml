 ### Events ###
 dawn.1.t:0 "The Direction of the Government"
 dawn.1.d:0 "While we are a rather small country, with the passing of Baron Recimir the new Baron, Alaric has decided to invite what few politicians we have in order to decide in which direction the government shall lead Rumare."
 dawn.1.a:0 "We must open up to the world."
 dawn.1.b:0 "Maintain the status quo."
 dawn.1.c:0 "We must defend our island to the last breath!"
 dawn.3.t:0 "Choosing Our Allies"
 dawn.3.d:0 "The truth is we are a small nation, we simply cannot hope to stay relevant nor survive in the current Griffonian political climate, thus we must find someone to protect us. Our advisors have suggested that we contact either what remains of the Griffonian Empire or ask Wingbardy to allow us to join the Karthinian Pact. What shall we do?"
 dawn.3.a:0 "I suppose it's time to bend the knee."
 dawn.3.b:0 "The Wingbardians aren't that bad."
 dawn.3.c:0 "We don't need either of them."
 dawn.4.t:0 "The Shores of Rumare"
 dawn.4.d:0 "Recently we have been contacted by diplomats from the tiny Barony of Rumare, and from what they say it seems that the new Baron fearing for his little plot of land wishes to once more pledge allegiance to the Empire. What shall we do?"
 dawn.4.a:0 "Well this is a pleasant surprise."
 dawn.4.b:0 "Give them the cold shoulder."
 dawn.5.t:0 "The Shores of Rumare"
 dawn.5.d:0 "Recently we have been contacted by diplomats from the tiny Barony of Rumare, apparently Baron Dawnbreaker fearing for the safety of his nation and his subjects wishes to join the Karthinian Pact. What shall we do?"
 dawn.5.a:0 "Sure, let them join the Pact."
 dawn.5.b:0 "I never liked Rumare anyway."
 dawn.6.t:0 "Back Together Once More"
 dawn.6.d:0 "We've received news from our diplomats in Griffonia. It seems that the Regent has decided to allow us to rejoin the Empire as a vassal state once more."
 dawn.6.a:0 "That's nice."
 dawn.7.t:0 "The Cold Shoulder"
 dawn.7.d:0 "It seems that the Imperial Regent has decided to give us the cold shoulder and refused to permit us back into the Empire, perhaps we should ask the Wingbardians for help?"
 dawn.7.a:0 "Hopefully they'll let us into the Pact."
 dawn.7.b:0 "I refuse to grovel again, we're on our own."
 dawn.8.t:0 "An Offer from Rumare"
 dawn.8.d:0 "It seems that after receiving the cold shoulder from the Imperial Regent when he wished to rejoin the Empire Alaric Dawnbreaker, perhaps out of spite has sent a diplomat asking to allow Rumare to become a member of the Karthinian Pact."
 dawn.8.a:0 "Sure, why not, let them join."
 dawn.8.b:0 "They're on their own."
 dawn.9.t:0 "The Pact"
 dawn.9.d:0 "After some debate with their allies it seems that the Wingbardians have allowed us to join the Karthinian Pact."
 dawn.9.a:0 "Great!"
 dawn.10.t:0 "All Alone"
 dawn.10.d:0 "Despite the best efforts of our diplomatic corps we have failed to find allies in both Wingbardy and the Griffonian Empire, we are very much on our own."
 dawn.10.a:0 "We need new diplomats."
 dawn.11.t:0 "The Shores of Rumare"
 dawn.11.d:0 "It seems that after being scorned by the Wingbardians, Baron Dawnbreaker has decided to send a diplomat to the Imperial Capital in an effort to once more rejoin the Empire, perhaps we should overlook his brief stint with the Karthinian Pact."
 dawn.11.a:0 "Let them join the Empire, what's the worst that could happen?"
 dawn.11.b:0 "They're on their own."
 dawn.12.t:0 "The Baron's Offer"
 dawn.12.d:0 "We have received an interesting offer from the Baron of Rumare today, he is offering to buy the city of Residence, and the surrounding countryside for an amazingly large sum. A sum so large that it could return the entirety of Griffinstone back into prosperity once more. What shall we do?"
 dawn.12.a:0 "It's a deal!"
 dawn.12.b:0 "Residence is not for sale."
 dawn.13.t:0 "Griffinstone Accepts"
 dawn.13.d:0 "After some negotiating the Lords of Griffinstone have decided to accept our deal, thus we are now the proud owners of Residence. Unfortunately, this little purchase has cost us practically our entire treasury, and it might take months if not years for us to recover financially."
 dawn.13.a:0 "Great!"
 dawn.14.t:0 "Griffinstone Refuses"
 dawn.14.d:0 "It seems that despite the best efforts of our diplomats, merchants and the Baron himself the Lords of Griffinstone have refused to sell Residence to us, thus denying us our ancient rights to the land. What shall we do?"
 dawn.14.a:0 "To Tartarus with it! The field of battle will settle this!"
 dawn.14.b:0 "We will bide our time..."
 dawn.14.c:0 "I never wanted Residence anyway..."

 LAK_capitalists_desc:0 "The Fishing industry is one of the most important industries on Rumare, employing a large amount of the population.

 LAK_grand_plan:0 "Dig in and Pray"

 LAK_superior:0 "Man the Cannons"
 LAK_superior_desc:0 "We shall defend our island against any and all invaders, by overwhelming them with firepower. Our cannon fire will be so strong in volume that it will blot out the sun from the sky, invisible for the shells that we launch at our enemies.

 LAK_modern_rifles:0 "New Rifles"
 LAK_modern_rifles_desc:0 "With our own rifles beginning to fall into the problem of being outdated, we must strive to keep our weaponry on the bleeding edge of technology. New model rifles and soldier’s gear is of utmost importance."

 LAK_import_guns_desc:0 "The Baron, upon reorganising the military, happened to stumble upon some old contacts from across the shattered Empire, that happened to have access to new and shiny rifles from the finest forge smiths the Empire had ever seen.

 LAK_forts:0 "Fortification Effort"

 LAK_support_equipment:0 "Organise Support Squads"
 LAK_support_equipment_desc:0 "We must begin to add supporting squads to our frontline combatants- those that don’t see front line service; the army doctors, supply officers, reconnaissance units, and the like.

 LAK_close_air_support_desc:0 "Continuing down our focus on ruling the skies, we should focus on producing dedicated fighter planes capable of supporting our ground operations with Close Air Support; Localised short range bombers that can rapidly react to the changing fight on the ground."
 LAK_bombers:0 "Prioritise Bombers"

 LAK_strategic_bomber:0 "Strategic Destruction"
 LAK_strategic_bomber_desc:0 "We must continue to expand our doctrine of destroying enemy factories and city centres. As such, we must develop a dedicated long range bomber to conduct this type of battle- a bomber capable of both travelling far abroad, and carrying massive payloads of explosives."
 LAK_expand_airports:0 "Expand Our Airfields"
 LAK_expand_airports_desc:0 "It is time to enlarge our airfields to accommodate our new airplane models, as we are rapidly running out of runway space. Specially dedicated areas for airplanes shall be set aside, and land cleared and raised or lowered as necessary."

 LAK_jets:0 "Piercing the Speed of Sound"
 LAK_jets_desc:0 "New scientists from around the world have reported fighter planes on the other continent across the pond, as it were, capable of penetrating the sound barrier.

 LAK_radar:0 "RADAR Technology"
 LAK_radar_desc:0 "Capable of tracking an aeroplane long before visible contact, RADAR may be cutting edge technology, but we would be foolish not to make use of it. The Baron has already ordered us to begin development of our own RADAR systems, and as such, we must hurry to finalise designs."
 LAK_naval_base:0 "Establish the RN"
 LAK_naval_base_desc:0 "We must make strides to modernise our small fledgling navy. With onset war coming on the horizon, we need a good way to defend our lake, making it impossible to cross by enemy forces. Establishing a Modern Rumaran Navy is an excellent first step in this process."
 LAK_flexible_navy:0 "A Small Fleet"
 LAK_flexible_navy_desc:0 "Because our Lake itself is quite small, our navy as well should match it, as we have no need for massive battleships and outdated battlecruisers. Instead, we should focus on smaller craft, such as “submarines”- special craft capable of submerging below the water, and cruiser-sized vessels."
 LAK_submarines:0 "Lake Sharks"
 LAK_submarines_desc:0 "We should capitalise on our advances in modern naval vessels to produce these new submarines our engineers have been drafting. Practically invisible to surface craft, we can easily defend our waters from the safety of the lake’s depths."
 LAK_destroyers:0 "Trade Escorts"
 LAK_destroyers_desc:0 "We should capitalise on our advances in modern naval vessels to improve our trade escort vessels, both to defend our trade convoys, and by extension, patrol the waters of our lake, and keep them clear of any enemy vessels or troops."
 LAK_amphibious:0 "Amphibious Assault"
 LAK_amphibious_desc:0 "We must prepare for the eventuality that we may need to transport troops across our lake, without the use of a land bridge, and under enemy fire.

 LAK_lake_control:0 "Dominate the Lake"
 LAK_lake_control_desc:0 "It is time to secure our Naval Victory for good. More Ships must be built in better dockyards, and our doctrine itself must be refined to such perfection that no vessel dares to enter our lake without our permission."

 LAK_joined_GRI_desc:0 "Just because the Empire is in the gutter doesn’t mean we should abandon it."
 LAK_GRI_resetlment:0 "Griffonian Migrants"
 LAK_GRI_resetlment_desc:0 "Empire is going through hard and bloody times, while Rumare as of now still haven't seen any conflict, and our little country is as idyllic as it always has been, if we would spend a bit of our influence on launching a propaganda campaign in all parts of the Empire, showing our little country in its entire glory, we could attract many griffons from all sides of old Empire."
 LAK_GRI_guns:0 "Guns of Boreas"
 LAK_GRI_guns_desc:0 "By exploiting our newfound friendship with Empire, we could petition them to help us with armaments, so Rumare could stay how it is now."
 LAK_GRI_bank:0 "Entice the Bankers"
 LAK_GRI_bank_desc:0 "Empire is going through hard times, such times aren't good for businesses, and seeing how our propaganda campaign has been a success, we should now focus our attention on the getting Griffonian National Bank to move its assets to Rumare, negotiations won't be easy, and the bank will probably demand some high tax cuts, but in the end it will convince many businesses to relocate to Rumare."
 LAK_joined_WNG:0 "The Karthinian Pact"
 LAK_joined_WNG_desc:0 "The Wingbardians might have ruined the Empire, but the Karthinian Pact makes for great friends in these times."

 LAK_migrating_karthinians:0 "Franmistrian Migrants"
 LAK_migrating_karthinians_desc:0 "Now that we had joined Karthinian Pact we are able to lax our migration laws with them, then if we would just run a small 'information' campaign in Pact's countries, we should attract thousands of migrants filled with hope for better life here, in Rumare."
 LAK_wingbardian_research:0 "Entice Scientists"
 LAK_wingbardian_research_desc:0 "There is many bright minds in Wingbardy, if we would send our agents to few research institutes, and try to convince their personnel with hefty 'research grants' if would relocate here, it would be a great boost to our academia."
 LAK_joined_no_one:0 "Our Path is Our Own"
 LAK_joined_no_one_desc:0 "We don't need any friends!"
 LAK_preperations:0 "Arm the Nation"
 LAK_preperations_desc:0 "Now that we opened our eyes, and decided on being all alone, we need to use every way to make our army as prepared as it can be, it wouldn't do harm if we would use our agents to find less loyal elements of armies from local baronies and houses, and while sparing a bit from our treasury, we should try to convince them to 'lose' a gun or two, or maybe get few of their officers in our army."
 LAK_claims:0 "Ancient Claims"
 LAK_claims_desc:0 "Once before there was even a Kingdom of Griffinstone, the Kingdom of Rumare ruled from the Erie to the Blackstone Mountains, but look at us now. Stuck on a miserable little island in the middle of a lake. Perhaps the time has come to remind the world of our ancient claims?"
 LAK_buy_residence:0 "The Purchase of Residence"
 LAK_buy_residence_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Griffinstone is in a sorry state. Its people lay hungry in the streets and its economy is in ruins, but we on the other claw are prospering. It would take nearly every penny in the Barony's treasury, but perhaps we could buy the city of Residence from the Kingdom of Griffinstone."
 LAK_claim_EYR:0 "A House Divided"
 LAK_claim_EYR_desc:0 "The Lands which are now under Houses Eyrie and Erie were once the Crownlands of the Kingdom of Rumare. With the two houses constantly fighting it shouldn't be that big of a problem to take over their lands."

 LAK_isolation_desc:0 "Let's face this, rest of old empire is busy with constant wars and intrigues, while our little country is stuck on this small island, we don't have any real power to face others in open field. And as such, instead of dreaming of unreal conquest, we should focus on making the best with what we have here, and isolate ourselves from the unimportant quarrels that rest of Griffonia is so busy being middle of."
 LAK_protect_islands:0 "The Fortress of Rumare"
 LAK_protect_islands_desc:0 "Our decision to isolate our country from the rest of continent seems to be for the best, but to make sure that none will try and take our little island from us, we should create defences that will be unable to be broken, and hopefully will scare any potential attacker off."
 LAK_infward_focus:0 "Develop the Economy"
 LAK_infward_focus_desc:0 "Now that we finally are left alone, and we are safe, we can focus on making Rumare into an economic powerhouse, this great undertaking will many years, and won't be easy, but we might as well start already."

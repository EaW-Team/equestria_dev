 nimbusia.2.d:0 "After a passionate debate on ethics, where the actual question at hand was often out of sight due to lengthy allegories and examples, it is up to the Ecclesia to determine what to do with the silver. The Treasurer was seen honouring the Gods of the city to grant the people the wisdom to save the funds.

For a long time, it was the pride of the country, but budget cuts and negligence left the highest point of the city a shadow of its former self. A lot of soldiers support the idea of a temple to the gods of war, while many older citizens seek to restore the Akropolis.

 ### NIM_silver_mines debate
 nimbusia.8.t_harmony:0 "Ponetagoras orates about Value"
 nimbusia.8.t_neutrality:0 "Demarescios orates about Prudence"
 nimbusia.8.t_fascism:0 "Speushippos orates about Bravery"
 nimbusia.8.d_harmony:0 "The Boule was baffled by Ponetagoras, the orator hired by the reformist faction. On the silver debate, he presented a lengthy story to proof his point. In it, when asked to keep their master’s money safe as he leaves to fight, two slaves handle the question very differently. One buries his master’s possessions, hiring guards to keep it all safe. The other slave, used the funds to invest in the polis. When the master comes back, he scolds the slave who buried his silver while praising the one that invested the money and turned a profit.\n\nThe Boule applauded Ponetagoras, who graciously bowed. Without even mentioning the actual events once, the orator managed to swing the Boule to the reformist position."
 nimbusia.8.d_neutrality:0 "Speaking slowly and deliberately, Demarescios, the philosopher of the traditionalist faction, gave a moving statement to the Boule. Recalling many tumultuous events in our history, the old pegasus asked at the end of every historical retelling; “How much of this would have been avoided if our ancestors had silver for emergencies?”\n\nAt the end the Boule’s members almost unanimously agreed with Demarescios that the silver should be saved. However, the issue was still up for a vote in the Ecclesia, the citizens’ assembly."
 nimbusia.8.d_fascism:0 "Speushippos addressed the Boule with great confidence. Completely foregoing rhetoric about saving or investing, the pegasus instead focused on a battle he knew he could win. Speushippos talked at length about the many conversations he had with soldiers and even generals about bravery. Bravery, then, was a virtue naturally in the middle between foolhardiness and cowardice. Of course Nimbusia’s soldiers could never be accused of cowardice, but what of foolhardiness? Was going in to battle with outdated guns and without modern equipment foolhardy? Speushippos left it to the others to contemplate that question.\n\nWhen the philosopher was done, the Boule voted to recommend the Ecclesia to vote for a military investment program!"
 nimbusia.8.a_good:0 "That’s why I hired you!"
 nimbusia.8.a_bad:0 "Our message didn’t get through..."

 ### NIM_city_culture debate
 nimbusia.9.t_harmony:0 "Ponetagoras pleads Innocence"
 nimbusia.9.t_neutrality:0 "Demarescios sees the Polis as a Group of Friends"
 nimbusia.9.t_fascism:0 "Speushippos on the State"
 nimbusia.9.d_harmony:0 "Ponetagoras had made a name by taking up causes that seemed all but lost. With arguments, clever use of words and sheer charisma, he has gotten many ponies acquitted in his career. His opponents knew this and tried all sorts of disruptive tricks to prevent the reformist from speaking. However, the Boule’s praesidium caught on to this and allowed Ponetagoras to deliver his oration.\n\nThe philosopher started praising Nimbusian wine and by weaving myth and reality together, he suggested that Nimbusian wine was indeed ambrosia, the drink of the Gods! Even most of his opponents had to admit that saying otherwise would be blasphemy. And that was precisely what Ponetagoras wanted to hear. Continuing his argument, the pegasus argued that the Wittenlanders, tasting the divine drink, were merely possessed by the divine spirit. Any actions committed while ‘drunk’ were then merely the will of the Gods. To go against that would be blasphemy as well. Therefore, the Wittenlanders were only guilty for obeying the Gods of Nimbusia!\nAt the end of the day, the Boule had to agree with the reformists . . ."
 nimbusia.9.d_neutrality:0 "The traditionalists had to pull a couple of tricks to stop the famed reformist lawyer Ponetagoras from speaking. By using some procedural changes, they managed to postpone the reformists’ speech by a day, while being able to have Demarescios give his oration today.  In it, the wise pony first stated that the crimes the foreigners committed were light, but the repercussions were large. A society was a close kinship of friends and it could only remain virtuous if the friends trusted each other. The Wittenlanders had broken the trust of the Polis and therefore had to leave the circle of friends.\n\nDemarescios reiterated again, that the group of friends needed to be careful about who to let in, as to keep the group’s traditions alive. He said that he bore no ill will against the Wittenlanders, but that they had to be politely instructed to leave Nimbusia. The Boule, then, found themselves agreeing on this, skipping the pleas of the other factions."
 nimbusia.9.d_fascism:0 "Speushippos managed to secure the stage in front of the Boule for himself. His speech roused the representatives with nationalist fervour. Indeed, the pegasi state had been the protector of the Riverponies since ancient times. But the unicorns of Wittenland, instead of being grateful, used the peace we paid for with our blood to feast and drink. To add insult to injury, the Wittenlanders brought their wasteful nature to Nimbusia. If the ponies of Nimbusia were to continue to respect our laws, the government had to make a point. Arrest the unicorns!\n\nAt this point much of the Boule was riled up and emotional, many did not expect Speushippos to use rhetoric, a form of arguing his master Palton despised. While the emotional Boule members drafted a warrant to be voted on by the Ecclesia, the more astute political minds of the country wondered whether Speushippos was not getting influenced more by his patron, Andreia."
 nimbusia.9.a_good:0 "A brilliant piece of oration!"  
 nimbusia.9.a_bad:0 "Trying to get their way over our friends’ backs, bah."
 nimbusia.9.b_good:0 "We should be careful, indeed."
 nimbusia.9.b_bad:0 "Radicals!"
 nimbusia.9.c_good:0 "We should arrest the Xenoi."
 nimbusia.9.c_bad:0 "The other factions are Proxenoi!"

### NIM_renovate_acropolis debate
 nimbusia.10.t_harmony:0 "Misuse of Funds is Murder"
 nimbusia.10.t_neutrality:0 "Honouring the Gods"
 nimbusia.10.t_fascism:0 "The Temple of War"
 nimbusia.10.d_harmony:0 "The reformists had taken the radical standpoint that the Akropolis should not receive any extra funds. Ponetagoras had the unenviable task to defend this to the Boule, which was mostly in favour of the renovation. When the orator took the stage, he began his talk like he often did, with something seemingly unrelated. Using numbers, he had gathered, Ponetagoras gave a sketch of poverty in the country, even amongst citizens. In fact, the hardships even led to some untimely deaths. With that he came to the Akropolis. Although he praised its beauty and the noble cause of renovation the complex, he had to admit that the state should have other priorities. Now that the Boule knew about the plight of the poorest citizens, could it really justify this prestige project?\n\nRepresentatives from the other parties cried foul, arguing that Ponetagoras was using emotional arguments, but the damage had been done. Many of the councillors indeed knew poorer ponies who were having difficulty scraping together a living. With those images in their mind, they voted to recommend the Ecclesia to use the money on economic means instead."
 nimbusia.10.d_neutrality:0 "Demarescios’s faction had choses to support a restoration of the Akropolis, the ancient complex of temples sitting atop the highest point of the city of Nimbusi. This debate was an easy one for the philosopher, since most of the Boule was already on his hand. The pony merely recounted the ancient founding of the city and how the Gods themselves were responsible for choosing this site for the city. To worship and respect the Gods then, was to ensure prosperity for the city and the country at large.\n\nWhen the other philosophers tried to counter his arguments, Demarescios brought out an old document that was recovered from the archives. In it, the architect of the original works, all those years ago, recounted that he asked the Oracle for advice on the Akropolis’s construction and that the Oracle answered that the way it is now would please the Gods greatly. With that revelation, the traditionalist arguments won out in the Boule!"
 nimbusia.10.d_fascism:0 "Speushippos had grand dreams of a state in which everypony was told about a natural order of rulers, soldiers and people. Where everypony would live in harmony and stability. His master Palton taught that to achieve this, the citizens had to be deceived to keep the system in place. Of course lying to the citizenry and instituting a dictatorship weren’t the reasons he gave to build a ‘Temple of War’. Instead, Speushippos gave a considered speech where he compared the Gods of Nimbusia and he openly asked the Boule which of them deserved the most reverence by getting a place on the Akropolis.\n\nOf course the philosopher answered his own question by going down the list. The State can only exist, he argued, because of the blessings of the gods of war. Without them, a country would surely be overrun by its enemies. Although the other Gods help make the state what it is, primacy should be given to its protectors. Therefore, the Gods of War deserved the highest spot on the city. Although the other philosophers considered this a thinly veiled attempt to put the military on a pedestal, the Boule was convinced by Speushippos’s logic and accepted his proposal."

 nimbusia.11.t_neutrality:0 "Demarescios argues Nature"
 nimbusia.11.t_fascism:0 "Andreia defends the Natural Order"
 nimbusia.11.d_harmony:0 "When the general public and the Boule have an opinion about something, it is not often that somepony dares sail against the wind. However, Ponetagoras is arrogant and has the words to back it up. Thus, the philosopher argued that, in the affair of the Helot and the Citizen, the Boule has no right to intervene.\n\nThe pony stated that who a stallion or a mare sleeps with is private business and that surely nopony, especially no stallion, would want the public watching whenever they shared the blessings of the God of love. This bold claim made almost all of the pegasi present flush red with embarrassment, prompting Ponetagoras to follow his claim up. Arguing that, if the Nimbusians do not want to watch what happens in private, they should also not seek to control it, not even in this case. The orator’s speech caused the Boule, still full of blushing ponies, to acknowledge that it would be best if everypony looked the other way."
 nimbusia.11.d_neutrality:0 "The nature of slavery has been a hot topic of debate for centuries amongst Nimbusian scholars. On the surface, the Helots seem the same as any other pony, making it hard to justify slavery from the onset. However, over time many philosophers, seeking to justify the status quo, have argued backwards. Seeing the current situation as the best, they started to think of reasons why Helots aren’t the same as others. Demarescios’s master, Aristrottle, was known for his great knowledge of the natural world. But he deduced that Helots must have less advanced minds than normal ponies, therefore it was justified to have them as slaves. The great philosopony of old indeed equated it to raising children.\n\nDemarescios, a faithful pupil of Aristrottle, reminded the Boule about this natural state of things in his oration. He, to the approval of the traditonalists present, made clear that like a child being taught not to do wrong, the couple required a public scolding. This would make it so that others did not follow the example of mingling with those who were not mature of spirit. . ."
 nimbusia.11.d_fascism:0 "It appeared that Speushippos, normally the philosopher of choice for the purist officers, had a disagreement with Andreia, the purist leader. So instead of the scattered-brained philosopher, the Boule was greeted by a stern-looking pegasus mare in full military dress, with only the sheath where here sword was supposed to be, being empty, since no weapons were allowed in the meeting. From the onset of her plea, it was clear Andreia was already furious. Her narrative, however, was still strong enough to convince the Boule.\n\nArguing that competition exists everywhere in nature, the purist defended that such should be the way with ponies as well. The citizens, through martial training and superior ability, had taken control of society. The weak and lazy Helots, however, lost on all accounts. She argued that these groups were fundamentally opposed to each other, and that the life of a helot was more akin to that of an animal, when compared to that of a citizen. Therefore, the citizen and the helot, by having an affair, committed a crime against nature and should be arrested for it.\n\nWhen she was done, the Boule barely passed her story, many ponies still finding her language too radical."

 nimbusia.22.d:0 "The reformists and the traditionalists have picked a fight over a growing concern about foreign influence in Nimbusia. Works from far off places like Equestria and Stalliongrad are being consumed by the youth, especially students. While the reformists consider this natural and think that foreign ideas could be adapted into Nimbusian culture, the traditionalists have rallied to defend Nimbusia´s own culture. With only limited political resources at their disposal, both parties can still choose to influence the Ecclesia and the Boule with bribes, flatteries and smearing campaigns, for a price."

 ### NIM Censorship first ideology speaks
 nimbusia.23.t:0 "Metakeros Speaks"
 nimbusia.23.d:0 "The leader of the reformist faction, the wealthy unicorn merchant known as Metakeros, was about to speak to the Ecclesia. The theatre at Nimbusi was packed with the citizens who were going to vote on the issue at hand. An entire evening was set aside for the issue of censorship. The unicorn took a deep breath, steeling himself for the task ahead. The political situation was slowly reaching a boiling point and Metakeros didn’t even cross the street alone at night anymore, afraid of fanatical opponents. Soon, all of that would be over and Nimbusia would be safe and free again. The unicorn raised his voice. . .\n\n“Citizens, Nimbusians, we have been brought together to face a grave danger. This foe is not one we can fight with spears or even guns, nay! But yet we have to muster all our courage to stand against it. The danger of which I speak, is tyranny disguised behind a seemingly noble cause!” The very mention of tyranny already riled up the crowd, as Metakeros expected. “Freedom! A word which under the traditionalists has lost all meaning! Citizens, Nimbusians, I do not hold you for fools! I do not seek to control your spirit. When you vote on this matter, do not consider your political faction. Consider if Nimbusia stands for freedom or for tyranny!” Loud cheering and applause broke out from the theatre and Metakeros tried to gauge whether his speech convinced enough ponies. It was going to be close. . ."
 nimbusia.23.a:0 "Pegalaios speaks next. . ."
 ### NIM Censorship second ideology speaks
 nimbusia.24.t:0 "Pegalaios Responds"
 nimbusia.24.d:0 "Pegalaios trotted towards the stage, giving a quick nod to Metakeros, who took his seat amongst the citizens’ assembly. The reformists have been stirring up trouble for some time now. They were idealist and did not fully understand the pillars that stabilised Nimbusian society. With so many dangerous ideas floating around, there was no telling what godless ideology could grip the minds of the ponies. The older stallion reached the stage. He was oh so tired of all this political manoeuvring, but it was the only way to guide the Nimbusians back to the right path.\n\n“Honourable citizens, let me, first of all, thank the respected Metakeros for his words. He is right. This measure does inhibit the freedom of us all. However, for virtuous citizens such as yourself, this measure will not even be felt. For only those of us who stray away from our sacred traditions, however, will be affected. And even they, in the end, when they see that the exclusion of foreign works has cleared their troubled minds, will be thankful.’’ Pegalaios let that sink in, using the time to gather air, “The freedom the reformists are preaching about is not the freedom to choose between virtuous alternatives. The freedom they are seeking, is the freedom to throw Nimbusia into chaos! Stay true to the gods and to the bonds we share and we shall prevail over our internal doubts!” Pegalaios sighed deeply as parts of the crowd cheered him on. Would the citizens stay true, or had this political infighting eroded all trust in the laws and traditions of old?"

 ### NIM Guard first ideology speaks
 nimbusia.27.t:0 "Pegalaios Cautions the Ecclesia"
 nimbusia.27.d:0 "More than a month had passed since Pegalaios last spoke in the outdoor theatre which was the meeting ground for the Ecclesia. Since then, the political deadlock had only worsened. Supporters from each of the factions got into arguments and sometimes even brawls. The peaceful polity he so desired was further away than ever before.\n“No,” the pegasus whispered to himself. He should not be defeatist. Clearly the political unrest was heading towards a climax. Perhaps a victory today, against the purists, could steer the people away from radical change? The old stallion stop listening to the doubts in his mind and cleared his throat.\n\n“Honourable Citizens, we meet again, this time to discuss a plan brought forward by the ponies known as the purists. They have expressed concern for the safety of the Strategos and seek to install their cronies as bodyguards so that he will be safe from anypony they deem unsuitable. I am concerned as well, but for something dearer to me than even our beloved Strategos’s life. It is our dear democracy, which has just received a death threat!” Shouts erupt from the theatre and insults get thrown at Pegalaios from the ranks of the purists. “There is no question here, honourable citizens! Granting anypony their private army is the death of democracy and the first step on the road to tyranny. Let us put a stup to the purist machinations and have our glorious army under command of the citizens!” Pegalaios stepped back and trotted to his seat. On his way, he passed the young Andreia, the purist leader, who seemed unimpressed. Pegalaios felt in his heart that she was obsessed with power. . ."
 nimbusia.27.a:0 "Andreia speaks."
 ### NIM Guard second ideology speaks
 nimbusia.28.t:0 "Andreia’s Speech"
 nimbusia.28.d:0 "Andreia took the stage, her eyes glowing with fiery determination. As the people had come to expect of the pegasus officer, she had donned a full military uniform. Her voice was commanding and in a way it seemed like she was instructing the Ecclesia instead of speaking to it.\n\n“Citizens, I have heard the protests of the aging stallion Pegalaios, but I have found these not only ungrounded, but also offensive. Pegalaios has the gall to call me a tyrant, while I only seek the best for the citizens of Nimbusia! Seeking merely to protect the life of an honourable member of the military is not tyranny. No, those who would risk his life on the basis of rumour and lies are the ones who deserve your righteous anger, citizens.” Andreia’s challenging words were riling up both her supporters and opponents, which made the officer smirk, she was thoroughly enjoying this. “So noble citizens, it is your duty to safe the Strategos’s life from those who plan the demise of our military! We are ready to serve the general, we but require your command!” The end of Andreia’s speech inflamed debate on the rows of seats of the theatre, this would be another close call. . ."

 nimbusia.30.t:0 "Education for Perioikoi"
 nimbusia.30.d:0 "The purists and the reformists, already strong adversaries, find themselves opposed on the issue of education. Metakeros, the reformist leader, has championed a plan to get the perioikoi the same level of education as citizens, to improve the research potential of the nation. The purists see this as an attempt to dilute the rights of citizens as the ruling class and have proposed an alternative to expand the existing academy. With only limited political resources at their disposal, both parties can still choose to influence the Ecclesia and the Boule with bribes, flatteries and smearing campaigns, for a price."

 ### NIM Education first ideology speaks
 nimbusia.31.t:0 "Andreia attacks the Education Plan"
 nimbusia.31.d:0 "Andreia’s heart was pounding in her chest, almost as if it was trying to burst out. Nimbusi had been heating up ever since the last debate of the Ecclesia and she felt her victory was near. She had but to bash the education plan of the reformists and their unicorn leader Metakeros. The very idea of anypony letting themselves be led by a unicorn was making her disgusted. When she took over, there would indeed be much work to do. . .\n\n“Citizens, friends, we have gathered here tonight for a deliberation on the matter of education. Or at least, that is what you have been led to believe. For the reformists seek to give their lackeys citizenship, so they can control us all. Their weak, despicable perioikoi allies! Those ponies who are obsessed with coins and would rather sell their mothers than to fight a battle!” Andreia felt that she was letting herself go, her rage flowed uncontrollably out of her mouth into the ears of the crowd. “Instead, I seek to strengthen the knowledge of our children. The citizens of Nimbusia are the pride of the Gods and our proposal will ensure that they gain the best possible education. Vote for Nimbusia, or perish from the reformists’ weakness.” Andreia took a deep breaths, the speech, which almost devolved into her shouting. The Ecclesia was riled up and chanting phrases at her. Had she won already?"
 nimbusia.31.a:0 "Metakeros takes the stand."
 ### NIM Education second ideology speaks
 nimbusia.32.t:0 "Metakeros Retorts"
 nimbusia.32.d:0 "Metakeros made his way to the stand, worry overtaking him. It seemed that his efforts had made the citizens more distrustful of perioikoi, more hateful towards foreigners and more militant. Or were these just the feelings that were already there manifesting themselves against him? He had to stop the purists, if they won this debate, who knows what else they could get away with?\n\n “Honourable citizens, everypony, thank you all for coming. I will cut to the chase, this meeting is about way more than a law about education. It is about determining who gets to participate and who gets excluded. I plan to give the children of those who labour hard for Nimbusia in the bureaucracy, as teachers or as merchants, the same rights as the children of soldiers. Honourable Nimbusians, is that not justice?” Metakeros let the question linger in the air for a few seconds, before continuing. “How much our dear Andreia may wish it, a society cannot persist on soldiers alone. Indeed, it is those that sacrifice their chance at battlefield glory for the good of society who deserve your admiration, honourable citizens. Be wary of letting anger over foreigners or a misplaced sense of superiority guide your gaze away from the truth. Support our wonderful class of perioikoi and grant them education!” Metakeros took a step back. The crowd had been silenced for the most part. Did he manage to turn the tide?"
 nimbusia.32.a:0 "May the Ecclesia be blessed with wisdom."

 nimbusia_revolt.1.t:0 "The Triumph of the Helots"
 nimbusia_revolt.1.d:0 "The Helots of Nimbusia have long served as an underclass of sorts, doing the menial labor and tasks that the upper classes considered beneath them. The Helots had few to no rights, and the mere idea of them participating in an election was laughable. The Helots were there to be shaped to their master's whims. But it could also be said that as the Helots were shaped by their masters, their masters were shaped by the Helots.\n\nThe Helots greatly outnumbered the citizens of Nimbusia, and this fact was not lost on the Numbusians. While the Nimbusians valued their martial strength as a way of defending from external aggression, their greatest fear was always the Helots.\n\nAnd as the slave army of the Helots marches victoriously through the broken gates of Nimbusi, those old fears are given shape. The old order of Nimbusia lies dead, along with most of its politicians. The Helots must now shape their own future and accept whatever consequences come from this radical change."
 nimbusia_revolt.1.a:0 "We are free at last."
 nimbusia_revolt.2.t:0 "The Political Storm"
 nimbusia_revolt.2.d:0 "The philosophers and politicians of Nimbusia prided themselves in their democratic tradition. That is not to say that debate within the Boule was always civilized, or even rational at all, but there was a certain pedigree that ponies were expected to live up to. Whatever the subject matter was, be it the troublesome Xenoi or a political scandal, it could be trusted that the various factions within the Boule would have clear agendas. \n\nBut as the Helots seize control over the political apparatus of Nimbusia, those days seem like distant memories. While the Helots might have been united by class during their revolution, once the dust had settled they quickly congregated into various cliques. \n\nThese groupings are often centered around charismatic and influential leaders, ones who have few agendas besides the accumulation of power. The Helots have little in common with the citizens of Nimbusia, lacking anything beyond the most basic education, and most subjects of debate are the division of looted wealth or the control of territory in Nimbusi. Whatever debate is had often devolves into brawls between the various factions that now inhabit the Helot-lead Boule.\n\nIt seems that political stabilization is a long way off from the Helots, and some measure of order must be achieved soon, lest the River Federation intervene. "
 nimbusia_revolt.2.a:0 "We will endure."
 nimbusia_revolt.3.t:0 "The Economic Collapse"
 nimbusia_revolt.3.d:0 "There were several key pillars that held up the economy of Nimbusia. The menial work of the Helots and the mercantilism of the Perioikoi all served to provide a solid economic base. The Helots could be counted on for the simpler tasks, like mining and farming, while the Perioikoi served as the merchants, bureaucrat, and artisans that are necessary for such a society.\n\nBut when the revolution came to Nimbusia those pillars were toppled to the ground and the aftermath erased any remaining shred of the former economic base that was so reliable for the Nimbusians. With most of the Citizens and Perioikoi either dead or in exile the only remaining class is the Helots. And while they might have made good menial laborers, economists they are not.\n\nThe current economy of Nimbusia has almost reverted to pure barter, as the central mint was unfortunately looted and burned during the revolution. The Helots have mostly abandoned their farms and mines, as most prefer to live in the opulent housing that formerly housed the Citizens. In their absence gangs of bandits now occupy many farmsteads, charging exorbitant prices for basic essentials.\n\nBut as the lack of basic necessities like food and water starts to sink in, it has become clear that something must be done soon, lest the entire state collapse into poverty."
 nimbusia_revolt.3.a:0 "Is there anything functioning in this gods-forsaken state?"
 nimbusia_revolt.4.t:0 "An Army of Slaves"
 nimbusia_revolt.4.d:0 "The ultimate triumph of the Helot armies over the far better organized, trained and equipped citizen armies of Nimbusia is considered a miracle by most military observers who survived the fighting. What the Helots lacked in training they made up for in numbers ten times over. In fact, it was uncommon for the citizens to be outnumbered 10 to 1 in most battles of the rebellion. But just as an army of slaves has its benefits, so too does it have its detriments.\n\nThe command structure of the army remains as frustratingly unclear to its soldiers as it was during the first days of the rebellion. While the Army had been united against a common foe during that time, after the storming of Nimbusi and the ultimate defeat of the Citizens those bonds were quickly severed.\n\nWhat remains of the army that shattered the warriors of Nimbusia is more akin to a massive gang than any organized military force. The various leaders of the army now rule large portions of the nation through force of arms alone, often extracting tribute from the local inhabitants. The militias remain as reluctant as ever, with many now openly expressing their desire to return to their families.\n\nWith the absence of a proper police force, martial law remains the de-facto rule for the entire country. Small offenses are often punished according to whatever whims the local warlords have at the moment, and many are fearful of the state fracturing even more if nothing is done.\n\nAn army of slaves now occupies Nimbusia, whether they can become something more is a question that remains unanswered."

 nimbusia_revolt.5.t:0 "The Conference Regarding the Nimbusian Issue"
 nimbusia_revolt.5.d:0 "It seems that the river federation has finally decided to react to our revolution, as a letter from the leaders of the federation arrived by envoy yesterday. The letter reads as follows:\n\n"To the new leaders of Nimbusia\n\nThe recent events in Nimbusia have created a large upheaval, both in Nimbusia and in the wider federation. Lawlessness and poverty seem ready to consume the Nimbusian region, and as such an official conference has been scheduled to deal with this matter. Be advised that this warning is only a matter of politeness, as Nimbusias representatives within the federation have yet to be determined, and as such you will not be provided with the privilege of attending. We hope that this warning will encourage you to establish the rule of law as soon as possible, lest drastic measures are taken.\n\nBest regards\n-The Council of the River Federation"\n\nThere is little we can do at this point, we are at the mercy of the vultures of the river federation that now circle the cadaver of Nimbusia. We can only hope that we have pleased them."

 nimbusia_revolt.6.t:0 "Invitation to The Conference Regarding Nimbusia"
 nimbusia_revolt.6.d:0 "Due to the recent upheavals that have gripped Nimbusia, an emergency conference to determine the river federations reaction to the Nimbusian issue. As a member of the Federation, we are entitled to attend the conference. If the Nimbusians can't get their act together a policing action may be required."
 nimbusia_revolt.6.a:0 "Interesting"
 nimbusia_revolt.7.t:0 "The Conference Begins"
 nimbusia_revolt.7.d:0 "The date of our judgement seems to have arrived, as various officials from the river federation gathered to discuss the so-called "Nimbusian problem" We have previously been threatened with direct military intervention if the Federation is not satisfied with our progress, and we have received frustratingly little feedback on what we are actually supposed to do. In the end, we can only wait and hope for a merciful judgment."
 nimbusia_revolt.7.a:0 "What will their consensus be I wonder?"
 nimbusia_revolt.8.t:0 "The Nimbusian Policing Action"
 nimbusia_revolt.8.d:0 "After the conference concluded the river federation has officially declared our government a "Detestable gathering of bandits and warlords" The various militaries of the federation are now surging across the border, and we seem hopelessly outgunned. It would take a military genius to save us from this mess. But we Helots have faced impossible odds and triumphed, to arms comrades. Perhaps we will die, but if we do it will be as free ponies, glory to the Helots!"
 nimbusia_revolt.8.a:0 "I have lived as a slave, and I have lived as a free pony, but I will die a Helot!"
 nimbusia_revolt.9.t:0 "The Nimbusian Reconstruction Authority"
 nimbusia_revolt.9.d:0 "It seems that we have managed to please the vague whims of the Federation, and our government has been declared legitimate. Although they insist on creating a Nimbusian Reconstruction Authority, which will oversee our every action, effectively turning us into a protectorate of the federation, but the fact remains that we have earned our freedom. Shipments of food and water, along with soldiers to help secure the country are already arriving. We made it, we are finally free to return to our homes."

 #The Boule political path
 NIM_choose_harmony:0 "Support the Reformist Cause"
 NIM_choose_harmony_desc:0 "Although Metakeros, a wealthy unicorn merchant, served in the army and gained citizenship, many non-pegasi did not get the chance. In the Boule, he has gathered some support to reform Nimbusian society into one where non-pegasi and non-soldiers will also be represented fairly. To represent the reformist cause, the unicorn has decided to hire the services of a well-known orator..."

 NIM_choose_neutrality:0 "Protecting Tradition"
 NIM_choose_neutrality_desc:0 "Pegalaios, an older and well respected pegasus is the spokesstallion for the traditionalists. They see Nimbusia’s ancient traditions and values as the cornerstone of the state. Seeking to have the state run by ancient virtues such as justice and bravery, Pegalaios hopes to steer the Boule away from radical change. On his side, the veteran turned politician a follower of Aristrotle called Demarescios."

 NIM_choose_fascism:0 "Fight for Strength"
 NIM_choose_fascism_desc:0 "Andreia, a young officer in the army, heads the purist faction. They argue that the Boule makes Nimbusia indecisive and vulnerable. She has rallied many young pegasi to her side, who seek to claim their right as undisputed rulers of Nimbusia. To accomplish this, Andreia allied herself with the philosopher Speushippos, who forged the radical ideas in Palton’s ‘Republic’ into an antidemocratic platform."

 NIM_boule_deliberates:0 "The Boule Deliberates"
 NIM_boule_deliberates_desc:0 "The Boule, the citizens’ council, is the excecutive of the Nimbusian democracy. But the citizens of Nimbusi can’t seem to agree on anything. With both reformists and purists seeking to break the status quo, even the smallest issues turn into an ideological struggle. However, the chaos is an opportunity for ambitious ponies to steer the citizenry with the ancient skill of rhetoric..."

 NIM_what_to_grow:0 "What to grow?"
 NIM_what_to_grow_desc:0 "The mountainous terrain of Nimbusia is ill-suited to farm grain and other foods. Olives and wine would be better candidates, but that would make Nimbusia reliant on foreign trade. This small question has erupted into a matter of principle about the direction of the country, with reformists favouring wine, traditionalists being pro-olive and purists insiting on grain."

 NIM_silver_mines:0 "Speaking of Silver"
 NIM_silver_mines_desc:0 "Recently, the Gods have blessed us with the discovery of a large vein of silver. These riches sit unused, however, since the Boule cannot decide what to do with our newfound wealth. Although some want to keep the silver for hard times, the reformists and purists seek to invest the silver to strengthen their preferred parts of Nimbusia."
 
 NIM_city_culture:0 "The Ecstasy of Foreigners"
 NIM_city_culture_desc:0 "Xenoi, foreigners, have been causing problems in the city. Often drunk on wine, these magi from Wittenland are a nuisance. The reformists have taken up the cause for the foreigners, hoping to combat xenophobia The others factions, meanwhile argue over a suitable punishment for the unicorns."

 NIM_renovate_acropolis:0 "Renovating the Akropolis"
 NIM_renovate_acropolis_desc:0 "The Akropolis of Nimbusi used to be the pride of our people. However, in recent years the temples on it have stood in disrepair. Now, the citizenry demand that something be done. The purists seek to build a new temple to the gods of war, while the traditionalists want a historical renovation. The Reformists, meanwhile, consider the massive building project a waste."

 NIM_slave_affair:0 "A Scandal of Decency"
 NIM_slave_affair_desc:0 "A slave and her master have been caught having an affair. The purist faction is furious, demanding they are punished for diluting pure pegasus blood. The traditionalists are content with a scolding for the two lovers, while the reformists consider the affair personal and want the Boule to acknowledge it has no rights to intervene here."

 NIM_censorship:0 "Censorship of Foreign Works"
 NIM_censorship_desc:0 "After yet another academy student was caught citing the work of Caramel Marks on campus, the traditionalists have had enough of foreign literature. They are a threat to the stability of Nimbusia and should be controlled by a censor. The reformists see this as a direct threat to their freedom and have rallied against the measure."

 NIM_guard:0 "A Personal Bodyguard"
 NIM_guard_desc:0 "With tensions rising, some ponies are concerned for the safety of the Strategos. The purists seek to establish a bodyguard of strong soldiers directly under the command of the General. However, the traditionalists warn that this is a step towards tyranny, as soldiers should only be used with democratic oversight."

 NIM_education:0 "Education for Perioikoi"
 NIM_education_desc:0 "With the pace of scientific progress increasing, the reformists are concerned that we are missing out on a vital pool of talent, namely non-citizen perioikoi. In an ambitious proposal, they demand funding for education for the children of non-citizens. The purists have responded with their own plan to renovate the Academy of Nimbusi into a centre for higher learning. For pegasi, that is."

 NIM_big_issue:0 "A Pair of Wings"
 NIM_big_issue_desc:0 "The issue of Star Chaser, the griffon who is adamant that he is a pegasus, has polarised the political climate in the Boule. The reformists see his willingness to try and fit in as an example for non-citizens and support the bird. The traditionalists are fine with letting the harmless and delusional griffon stay, while the purists openly accuse Star Chaser of espionage."

 NIM_appoint_new_commander:0 "A New Chief of Army"
 NIM_appoint_new_commander_desc:0 "In the militarised society of Nimbusia, the army is at the centre of politics. To maintain democratic control of the military, the Boule elects pegasi for certain military offices. It is now time for the Boule to elect a new Chief of Army and all three factions have put forward their preferred candidate, so the vote can still swing in one of three ways."

 NIM_the_law_of_freedom:0 "Pass The Nomos Eleutheriae"
 NIM_the_law_of_freedom_desc:0 "The reformists have managed to secure enough support to finally bring the perioikoi into the fold. When the Law of Freedom, as they call it, passes, the influx of new members to the Boule will ensure that the reformists will have a comfortable majority to pass their other reforms."

 NIM_the_law_of_virtue:0 "Pass The Nomos Aretes"
 NIM_the_law_of_virtue_desc:0 "The traditionalists have managed to sway the Boule to stay the course. Passing the so-called Law of Virtue, a set of regulations on how to behave in public office, is but the first step on their agenda. Those that seek inspiration from our illustrious ancestors can rest easily, knowing that Nimbusia will stay true to our ancient legacy."

 NIM_suspend_ostracism:0 "Suspend The Graphe Paranomon"
 NIM_suspend_ostracism_desc:0 "The purists have increased their control over the military to the point where they are now openly conspiring against democracy! They seek to intimidate the Boule into suspending the Graphe Paranomon, the fundamental law that enables undemocratic laws to be overturned. Is this how democracy dies?"

 #Puritans win
 NIM_state_of_war:0 "The State of War"
 NIM_state_of_war_desc:0 "In the minds of the people, there is a difference between peace and war. It is clear, however, that there will always be another war and we should prepare for it. By declaring Nimbusia to be in a perpetual state of war, we will be able to take all the necessary measures for the defence of our Nation."

 NIM_keep_young:0 "Timocracy"
 NIM_keep_young_desc:0 "It was the bold spirit and search for glory of the young officers of Nimbusia which led us to finally take full control of the state. It is therefore only fair that the most energetic and brave pegasi should lead the country. We will proclaim Andreia as our Autokratessa."

 NIM_get_old:0 "Aristocracy"
 NIM_get_old_desc:0 "It is a true sign of wisdom to give responsibility to those who are more capable. Gylhippos, a veteran officer, is a more calculated and experienced pegasus. We shall proclaim him Autokrator so that his guidance can lead Nimbusia to true strength."

 NIM_fascism_focus_1:0 "A Flying Army"
 NIM_fascism_focus_1_Tech:0 "A Flying Army"
 NIM_fascism_focus_1_desc:0 "Our Army consists purely of pegasi now, which opens the door for some interesting modern doctrines. The Nimbusian soldiers will be able to utilise both horizontal and vertical formations and our pegasi will always outmanoeuvre the enemy!"

 NIM_fascism_focus_2:0 "The Search For Glory"
 NIM_fascism_focus_2_Tech:0 "The Search for Glory"
 NIM_fascism_focus_2_desc:0 "Nimbusian pegasi are the bravest people of all. But we must foster eternal competition between units and soldiers and encourage a search for glory. Our soldiers will be fearless and fight until the last soul if required. We will be remembered as the greatest warriors in history!"

 NIM_fascism_focus_3:0 "Perpetual Agoge"
 NIM_fascism_focus_3_desc:0 "The Agoge rears all young pegasi into upstanding citizens and into brave soldiers. However, with time, it seems that some ponies forget the lessons they learned. By selecting groups of citizens for re-education, we can increase the readiness level of every citizen, even those not normally associated with the army. Of course, this will increase the strain of the army on the economy even further - but that's a sacrifice we all are prepared to accept."

 NIM_fascism_focus_4:0 "The Advisory Boule"
 NIM_fascism_focus_4_desc:0 "Although the opinions and ideas of our most respected citizens are to be taken seriously, the bickering Boule can become a true security hazard. By removing legislative powers from the people and giving them to our ruler, we will ensure stability and continued security."

 NIM_fascism_focus_5:0 "The Krypteia"
 NIM_fascism_focus_5_desc:0 "To keep the slave population in check, we must establish a secret organisation to monitor them. Who knows what the earth ponies and unicorns might be plotting. Naturally, the skills we learn from suppressing dissent at home, can be useful in warfare as well."

 NIM_fascism_focus_15:0 "Unquestioning Discipline"
 NIM_fascism_focus_15_desc:0 "It takes a great sense of duty to listen to orders that others might deem suicidal. Marching through a hail of bullets, or protecting a surrounded strongpoint to cover a retreat. However, for a Nimbusian, these orders are not a punishment, but an honour. For Glory and Death!"

 NIM_fascism_focus_6:0 "The Flying Phalanx"
 NIM_fascism_focus_6_Tech:0 "The Flying Phalanx"
 NIM_fascism_focus_6_desc:0 "In a bygone age, a tight formation of pegasi could hold back many times their number. The Phalanx was the tank of the modern battlefield and it can be so again. By using complicated aerial formations, our elite troops can effectively their resistance to small arms fire."

 NIM_fascism_focus_7:0 "The Metal Pegasus"
 NIM_fascism_focus_7_desc:0 "For millennia, the skies were ruled by our warriors. However, we must concede that technology is making the skies a dangerous place for pegasi. Instead of shying away from the airplane, we should be the ones to embrace it. Only then can we keep the air safe for our army."

 NIM_fascism_focus_8:0 "Autarkia And Oikonomia"
 NIM_fascism_focus_8_desc:0 "If we are to sustain our state, we cannot be wasteful and we cannot rely on others. We must be autarkic and ban trade to the xenoi, while outlawing most luxuries to be more economical. It is time for Nimbusia to rid itself of all the useless distractions of the modern world."

 NIM_fascism_focus_9:0 "They Will Fear Them"
 NIM_fascism_focus_9_desc:0 "Our population must be kept under control. The sheer size of the serf population means that there is always the risk of a revolt. But by using Krypteia to spread propaganda of the terrible things griffons do to ponies and how we can protect against that, they might just fear the enemy more than they hate us."

 NIM_fascism_focus_11:0 "The Auxiliary Program"
 NIM_fascism_focus_11_desc:0 "Not all slaves are beyond saving. By recruiting some into the army for support tasks, we could increase the number of citizens actually fighting. Who knows, some of these auxiliaries could still proof their worth."

 NIM_fascism_focus_12:0 "Forced Industrialisation"
 NIM_fascism_focus_12_desc:0 "We cannot afford to let our industry fall behind. Whatever the cost, we need new factories now! Luckily, we have an excess of labour. We can lower the supply of labourers and increase demand..."

 NIM_fascism_focus_10:0 "They Will Fear Us"
 NIM_fascism_focus_10_desc:0 "There is a clear distinction in Nimbusia. We are strong and the slaves are weak. To keep it that way, we must instil a constant fear into the ranks of these people. With careful population control measures, we will keep our nation stable."

 NIM_fascism_focus_13:0 "Military Exercise"
 NIM_fascism_focus_13_desc:0 "It has occurred to us that our army might need training on life targets. Luckily, we have those in ample supply..."

 NIM_fascism_focus_14:0 "Revoke The Rights Of Perioikoi"
 NIM_fascism_focus_14_desc:0 "Pegasi are clearly the only ponies fit to have any responsibility. The past struggle for power along with the miserable state of our neighbours’ military shows that unicorns and earth-ponies cannot be trusted to do anything independently. No matter, we will guide them."


 #Economy
 NIM_farmer_help:0 "Help for Farmers"
 NIM_farmer_help_desc:0 "The backbone of our society may be our military, but the foundation which keeps it standing is the agriculture which feeds our soldiers. While those who work the farms may be simple Helots, non-citizens, we still must provide support for them in order to guarantee our society's source of food."

 NIM_give_farmers_new_jobs:0 "New Jobs for Farmers"
 NIM_give_farmers_new_jobs_desc:0 "With some of our recent investments into agriculture, an issue has reached our attention. Many Helots have found themselves out of work in agriculture, their labor no longer being necessary. The surplus of jobless Helots is a major issue, as it both represents wasted potential workforce, and a bored and possibly rebellious contingent of serfs. We must quickly put these ponies to work in other forms of work."

 NIM_merchants:0 "Merchants of Nimbusia"
 NIM_merchants_desc:0 "The merchant class of our society may be sparse and unliked, seen as weak and worthless, but they may be of great use to us. They bring to our nation not only goods, but stories- stories of industrial processes, great factories and the many things they produce. While we may avoid frivolties, it is best we don't ignore such things."

 NIM_foreign_factory_tacticts:0 "Foreign Industrial Tactics"
 NIM_foreign_factory_tacticts_desc:0 "One of the greatest weaknesses a warrior may have is stagnation- and the same applies to our society. While we may remain firm in our culture and government, if we are to progress into the modern era and remain relevant, we must adopt foreign techniques for industry. Stagnation is as good as a certain death."

 NIM_hillponies_controltowers:0 "Hillpony Watchtowers"
 NIM_hillponies_controltowers_desc:0 "The hillponies tribe, situated in the interior of our country, has perfectly situated terrain to watch our borderlands. From the hilltops we can construct watchtowers, making sure no fouldoer- whether foreigner or criminal- will go unseen by their vigilant eyes."

 NIM_hillponies_resources:0 "Hillpony Resources"
 NIM_hillponies_resources_desc:0 "The hills of our country can do much more for us than provide vantagepoints, however. The hills are rich with many minerals, perfect to create tools for our farmers and swords for our soldiers- as well as perhaps to fuel the growth of a true early industry, if we so wish."

 NIM_connect_the_land:0 "Connect the Land"
 NIM_connect_the_land_desc:0 "The lands of Nimbusia have long been seperated by harsh terrain, which has lead to a fair share of problems for us and our citizens. If our programs are to be properly integrated, and our citizens and soldiers properly able to traverse through their own nation, we must build up a base of infrastructure to connect our towns."

 NIM_farmers_in_factory:0 "An Industrial Workforce"
 NIM_farmers_in_factory_desc:0 "With our attempts to grow a domestic industry, the issue of what to use as a workforce has come into question. We could never think to use our citizens for such a low task- however, we have an abundance of helots working in agriculture. If we were to transfer some farmers to work in our cities' new factories, we will quickly be able to fulfill the requirements of these new facilities."

 NIM_connect_more_land:0 "Railway Programs"
 NIM_connect_more_land_desc:0 "While our earlier attempts to connect our nation were a success, it was still not enough, and there are still issues traversing our nation. With our newfound industry, we may be able to put a foreign technology to use- the railroad. By connecting major locations with railway lines and adding additional local infrastructure to support these lines, we may finally be able to connect our nation."

 NIM_philosophy:0 "Philosophic Traditions"
 NIM_philosophy_desc:0 "Our society was formed not by the blade, but with words. From the beginning of Nimbusia, logic and philosophy have been valued just as highly as we value our soldiers. Debates are commonplace, and the ponies of Nimbusia are pioneers in the arts of logic and science." 

 NIM_schools_for_everpony:0 "Educate the Helots"
 NIM_schools_for_everpony_desc:0 "[Root.GetNIM_schools_for_everponyDesc]"
 NIM_schools_for_everpony_desc_neutral:0 "While the education for the citizens of our nation is great, the majority of our population- the working class Helots- continue to be uneducated. While this worked for the Helots when they were primarily farmers, with our new industrial plans it is necessary that we give them basic education in order for them to be able to work our factories. This provides another opportunity, as well- we can use our position as educators in order to reassure the Helots of their natural position as our inferiors, and of the nobility of servitude."
 NIM_schools_for_everpony_desc_harmony:0 "We value the education of our citizens greatly, and it has always been something the government supported. However, for many years our nation has ignored another portion of our population who needs education- the Helots. Most Helots cannot even read, much less know about any further subjects. If we are to help create a fair society, we must begin by at the very least giving the Helots basic education."
 NIM_schools_for_everpony_desc_fascist:0 "The Helots we have attempted to put to work in our factories have been nothing short of incompetent- no doubt in part because of their lack of any education. While we would never dream of properly educating the Helots, perhaps we could put into place schools to help them learn the skills to work in factories- and perhaps help them remember who their betters are."

 NIM_back_in_business:0 "Back in Business"
 NIM_back_in_business_desc:0 "Our nation has taken a turn for a better, and many ponies who were once impoverished have found their place in the new industrial society we are creating. Our ambitious programs of industrialisation have had a great positive effect on our nation, and our industrial strength is beginning its exponential growth."

 NIM_industry_might:0 "Industrial Research"
 NIM_industry_might_desc:0 "With the growth of our industry, our capability to research grows as well. No longer needing to import scientific tools and with larger funding, our researchers have begun to expand their scope further."

 NIM_modern_industryies:0 "A Modern Industry"
 NIM_modern_industryies_desc:0 "While we are far from the industrial might of some far-off nations, our potential is great. With proper care, our fledgeling industry can be nurtured into a mighty and modernised industrial sector, and our nation can thrive."

 NIM_theater:0 "Theatre"
 NIM_theater_desc:0 "The theatre is an old and well-loved tradition in Nimbusia, where ponies gather to watch performances of epics, tragedies, and other great oratary works. Promoting nation-wide theatres both would bolster government support and bring more cultural uniformity to our nation."

 NIM_hillponies_in_factorys:0 "Hillpony Workers"
 NIM_hillponies_in_factorys_desc:0 "The hillpony tribes have an excess of workers, and our local factories need a workforce. We must encourage more hillponies to work in our factories, or else we may run out of labor to fuel our ever-growing industry."

 NIM_mines:0 "Hillpony Miners"
 NIM_mines_desc:0 "The hillponies, well suited to the hills they call home, make perfect candidates to use as labor in mines. With good enough pay as incentive, surely we will be able to make good use of the resources in the hills with the use of the local workforce."

 NIM_millitary_begining:0 "Blacksmiths to Factories"
 NIM_millitary_begining_desc:0 "In the past we have relied on blacksmiths and craftsponies to supply the weapons for our armies, however it is time to make a change to this. With foreign threats growing stronger and the obsolescence of our current military growing more apparent, we must begin the first reforms by upgrading our methods of production."

 NIM_look_into_the_army:0 "Begin Army Reforms"
 NIM_look_into_the_army_desc:0 "While our army is strong, loyal, and one of the most disciplined in the world, it is far from modern. By inviting our highest military staff to contemplate the future of our armed forces, we may be able to create a path to modernisation."

 NIM_new_guns:0 "New Guns"
 NIM_new_guns_desc:0 "Our nation is currently armed with merely muskets- while superior to the primitive swords used by some nations, they still cannot stand up to the weapons used by modern nations. Our soldiers deserve the very best weaponry, and it would not do to leave them with outdated guns."

 NIM_new_artillery:0 "New Artillery"
 NIM_new_artillery_desc:0 "Artillery is a rather useful weapon, allowing us to perform precision strikes on enemy positions from a safe distance. While some traditionalists have brought up concerns about artillery being a cowardly weapon, its effectiveness is undeniable.""

 NIM_new_battle_plans:0 "New Theory"
 NIM_new_battle_plans_desc:0 "The outdated strategies of old have proven to be next to worthless in the face of a modern army, and we must entirely change our way of thinking about war in order to fix this blatant flaw with our military."

 NIM_mountain_fighters:0 "Mountain Guns"
 NIM_mountain_fighters_desc:0 "The hilly and mountainous landscape of our nation and the surrounding lands proves to be a challenge for warfare, however it is also something we may use to our advantage. We can design specialised ordinance to use in mountainous terrain, able to be moved easily throughout the rough terrain to take up superior positions."

 NIM_improve_officers:0 "Officer Training"
 NIM_improve_officers_desc:0 "Our current general staff is one of the greatest the world has to offer- something admired by many of our neighbours. However, our current generals will not live forever, and we cannot let such knowledge die with themye. In order to both further improve our officers and assure new officers are up to standards, we must establish officer schools, where veterans may train new officers in the discipline of warfare."

 NIM_glory_to_the_army_desc:0 "Any true Nimbusian supports our glorious army, and we must make sure to keep it that way. Instead of letting our military sit idle until war, we can make use of it in order to fuel itself- military parades and other showcases of our military strength attract new recruits, project our power, and keep our soldier's disciplined. As such, we should increase the frequency of such endeavors."

 NIM_improve_spec_ops:0 "Special Operative Training"
 NIM_improve_spec_ops_desc:0 "We currently train all of our soldiers with the same methods, providing little room for the training of special forces. If we expand our training to allow special programs for such soldiers, however, we may see a marked increase in their performance."

 NIM_war_makes_smart:0 "War Makes Progress"
 NIM_war_makes_smart_desc:0 "We are not afraid of war, as some fools are. While many see war as a purely destructive force, we know otherwise- war breeds progress in many ways, and the fields of battle are always where you will find the world's latest inventions in play."

 NIM_more_factorys:0 "Military Development"
 NIM_more_factorys_desc:0 "We have already began to produce our weaponry in specialised factories, but said factories are few. We must put our money and helots to work in producing more factories and more weapons for our army, or else we may find ourselves unprepared for war."

 NIM_air_force:0 "Aerial Warfare"
 NIM_air_force_desc:0 "In our efforts to modernise, we must not ignore the entirely modern ways of war. We have heard that control of the skies is crucial in modern war, and we must not put such information to waste- the development of an air force, at the very least for defence."

 NIM_sky_hunters:0 "Sky Hunters"
 NIM_sky_hunters_desc:0 "The pegasi of Nimbusia have long been accustomed to the air, but they are mostly useless in warfare. These same pegasi- the expert fliers of our nation- would make perfect candidates to fly in our new air force, however. These recruits need a plane to fly in, and as such we quickly need to produce a modern design for a fighter plane, with which to wrest control of the skies."

 NIM_naval_force:0 "Assess the Navy"
 NIM_naval_force_desc:0 "Our navy, although being overlooked by some in favor of our army, is still a mighty force. If we are to begin changes to the navy, we must first assess our current situation. With the help of our naval officers, we shall establish a plan for the future of our navy."

 NIM_bomber:0 "Bomber Production"
 NIM_bomber_desc:0 "Tactical bombers are a flexible type of plane which allow for us both to support ground troups and damage the enemy's land. While many in our nation have frowned apon bombing as a dishonorable and cowardly way to war, it still may be useful to know how to create them."

 NIM_heavy_bomber:0 "Heavy Bombers"
 NIM_heavy_bomber_desc:0 "Some researchers have come up with a new model of bomber- a bigger fighter, with a much larger payload and focus on destroying the enemy's homefront rather than support for troops. While not the most honorable form of warfare, we should keep our options open."

 NIM_heavy_fighter:0 "Heavy Fighters"
 NIM_heavy_fighter_desc:0 "Heavy fighters are a more production-heavy, stronger and more powerful form of fighter. Designed to escort bombers, and as such having increased range, these fighters are heavier and require more fuel and resources, but also carry far heavier firepower to match."

 NIM_more_hunters_in_the_sky:0 "More Hunters in the Sky"
 NIM_more_hunters_in_the_sky_desc:0 "The core of an air force is its fighers- an air force can function with only fighters, but not without them. By focusing on outproducing the opponent in fighters, we will be able to permanently control the skies, allowing for any other operations to be completed smoothly."

 NIM_jets_rocketo:0 "Rocketry Experiments"
 NIM_jets_rocketo_desc:0 "Rocketry is a rather foreign technology, but it seems to have fascinated a few of our researchers. A small group of these scientists have come to us asking for a grant in order to develop rocket technology for military application. While this may turn out to be useless, it may be a worthy addition to our arsenals."

 NIM_carries:0 "New Carriers"
 NIM_carries_desc:0 "Our current carrier model functions well enough, but falling behind is never an acceptable option- we must constantly modernise our navy to assure the control of our seas."

 NIM_destroyers:0 "New Destroyers"
 NIM_destroyers_desc:0 "Building more capital ships is of no use if we have nothing to escort them. New destroyer models to keep our capital ships safe is a necessary time investment."

 NIM_dockyards:0 "Stratos Dockyard"
 NIM_dockyards_desc:0 "The funding of a large dockyard project in Stratos has been suggested to us by a few naval officers. The city's location nearby the capital and along a small peninsula positions it perfectly to be used as the staging point for our quickly increasing naval production and force projection."

 NIM_carrier_planes:0 "Planes for our Carriers"
 NIM_carrier_planes_desc:0 "Our naval officers have focused on the production of carriers, but these carriers are of little use without planes to fill them. We must create a new arsenal of fully modern carrier aircraft to accompany our capital ships on the sea."

 NIM_oil_rigs:0 "Offshore Oil Rigs"
 NIM_oil_rigs_desc:0 "Oil has been discovered in the oceans off our coasts, and this is a fantastic economic opportunity. Not only are many foreign nations willing to pay well for oil, but it can be put to use for domestic industrial development and production, as well as fueling our ships."

 NIM_submarine:0 "Submarines"
 NIM_submarine_desc:0 "Submarines, a class of ship overlooked by the majority of our naval officers, may be something to consider for future naval projects. If we are to ever clash with a nation reliant on foreign resources, we can use submarines to disrupt their trade routes."

 NIM_cruissers:0 "Modern Cruisers"
 NIM_cruissers_desc:0 "Cruisers- both an alternative for capital ships and a way to escort them- are a fine balance between smaller and larger ships, while still being relatively cheap to create. Considering the state of our industry, it may be best to focus on more modest ships such as these for the time being."


 #traditionalist victory
 NIM_polity:0 "Politeia"
 NIM_polity_desc:0 "The polity is our society, based around the poleis, or cities. More than just a bunch of buildings, a polity is a cooperation of many different ponies in a way they are used to. It is where citizens can grow into their potential, a home away from the normalcy of the household. We will make sure nopony can threaten this tradition."

 NIM_honor_and_virtue:0 "Honour and Virtue"
 NIM_honor_and_virtue_desc:0 "It is high time that the citizenry begins to act according to the principles we all hold high. We will act according to our honour and treat each other with respect. We will seek to pursue the all-important virtues, without indulging in worship of any particular characteristic. "

 NIM_ostracise_purists:0 "Ostracise the Purists"
 NIM_ostracise_purists_desc:0 "Some of the purist leadership is refusing to see that they lost, even now. Luckily, our illustrious forefathers put a system in place to neutralise threats to democracy. We will call forth the Ecclesia and order a vote to ostracise these dangerous radicals. Perhaps a banishment to foreign lands will help temper their spirits."

 NIM_discipline_the_army:0 "Discipline the Army"
 NIM_discipline_the_army_desc:0 "With their leaders out of the way, the purists are disorganised. They still hold sway over some of the army, however, and we must intervene. We will enact harsh disciplinary measures to get the army under control. The citizens run the country, not the military and we should ensure it stays that way."

 NIM_marginalise_reformists:0 "Marginalise the Reformists"
 NIM_marginalise_reformists_desc:0 "Although the reformists mean well, their idealism goes against both tradition and political reality. We should call the reformists out on their ultra-progressive ideas and weed some of their supporters away. With Metakeros’s faction out of the picture, we will be free to enact further reforms."

 NIM_tax_non_citizens:0 "Tax the Perioikoi"
 NIM_tax_non_citizens_desc:0 "With the reformists out of the way, we should make sure the state profits from the enterprises the perioikoi have been setting up. Since they don’t have political rights, some ponies thought it would be best to not tax them fully. However, these ponies should contribute to the polity as well."

 NIM_experience_of_the_ages:0 "Experience of the Ages"
 NIM_experience_of_the_ages_desc:0 "Nimbusia is an old state that has fought many conflicts, both political and martial. Let us remember the tales of old and use those traditions to make ourselves more powerful at present. The craftsponies, shipwrights and the hoplites still have much to learn from the poets and philosophers of old."

 NIM_more_land_for_soldiers:0 "Expand the Katoikiai"
 NIM_more_land_for_soldiers_desc:0 "The Katoikiai, homes for military colonists, are a way to both project our power in the countryside and increase the number of soldiers at our command. We can never have enough pegasi, so new poleis which can sustain themselves, will provide us with more soldiers and potential for industry."

 NIM_consult_the_oracle:0 "Consult the Oracle"
 NIM_consult_the_oracle_desc:0 "In ancient times, the Oracle at Prancetras was held in the highest esteem, since she provided wisdom from the gods themselves. In modern times, many ponies disregarded the oracle’s power. If we are to give the oracle and the gods their rightful place in society, we should start by consulting the oracle ourselves."

 NIM_honor_the_ancestors:0 "Honour the Ancestors"
 NIM_honor_the_ancestors_desc:0 "The battle of Thermoponylae has been the unifying moment for our nation and one we should never forget. However, the plaque remembering the event has been lost. It is time to replace it. Like before, it should say:\n“Go tell the Nimbusians, thou who passest by, That here, obedient to their laws, we lie.”"

 NIM_tradition_of_sacrifice:0 "Tradition of Sacrifice"
 NIM_tradition_of_sacrifice_desc:0 "In dire times, the Nimbusi are not afraid to make harsh sacrifices. All our citizens will be content with living with less, if it means that we can uphold our glorious military and win the war against foreign aggressors. True nobility is not Wittenlander extravagance, but Nimbusian Temperance."

 NIM_wisdom_age:0 "Wisdom Comes With Age"
 NIM_wisdom_age_desc:0 "Sofia, lady wisdom, is true knowledge of virtues and the world around us. It is reference for the Gods who rule all aspects of life and excellence at preforming one’s duties. We will not let young ponies disregard the advice of their elders. Sofia will teach us all and we shall be better for it!"

 NIM_with_your_shield:0 "With Your Shield or Upon it!"
 NIM_with_your_shield_desc:0 "A Nimbusian mother once told her son, who was doubting his own bravery, what he ought to do. “Come back with your shield, or upon it.” It is a very simple definition of bravery, but one that all our soldiers must follow. Nimbusians will never surrender!"

 NIM_martial_culture:0 "Martial Culture"
 NIM_martial_culture_desc:0 "We have honed the martial society which is our pride. The Nimbusian soldier is the envy of the known world. Disciplined and without equal. Skilled and unrelenting. The pegasi soldiers of Nimbusi will fight for their homes!"

  #harmonist victory
 NIM_harmonia:0 "Harmonia"
 NIM_harmonia_desc:0 "With our political victory in the Boule, we can start to quickly implement reforms to better the country.  Metakeros has gone from merchant to political leader. Under his leadership, we will live in harmony with all the ponies in our realm, with our friends in the coalition and with modern culture and technology!"

 NIM_free_mind:0 "Cultivating a Free Mind"
 NIM_free_mind_desc:0 "Ponies are not born with a free mind. Critical thinking, tolerance, open-mindedness, these things need to be taught. Let us introduce these values as a new core of Nimbusian society. And let us finally learn from the peoples around us, instead of belittling and mocking them."

 NIM_industrial_grants:0 "Industrial Grants"
 NIM_industrial_grants_desc:0 "To keep up with modern times, we will have to build up our industry to match those of our friends and our enemies. Luckily, there is much unused potential in Nimbusia and once we start to get the ball rolling, the free market will take care of the rest."

 NIM_rein_in_the_military:0 "Rein in the Military"
 NIM_rein_in_the_military_desc:0 "We will need to spend time and effort to curtail pegasi-superiority extremism in our military. Rather than being our guardians, these warmongers are the worst threat to peace. A combination of soft-spoken persuasion and harsh punishment will make the pegasi fall in line and march to the drumbeat of progress instead."

 NIM_elections_for_the_boule:0 "Elections for the Boule"
 NIM_elections_for_the_boule_desc:0 "With our large population and territory, a direct democracy is simply unsustainable. Instead, we should transform the Boule into an elected body of representatives. This will make it easier to pass laws and will strengthen democracy. Of course the Ecclesia will still be heard on the most important issues, but we cannot rely on it anymore."

 NIM_power_to_the_ecclesia:0 "Strengthen the Ecclesia"
 NIM_power_to_the_ecclesia_desc:0 "Even if we’d like to take the easy path and restricting direct democracy to increase effectiveness, we should not. Ponies are political animals and we will only find satisfaction if we can debate and decide the course of the community. The Boule should be marginalised and the Ecclesia strengthened, so that we may utilise the wisdom of all citizens!"

 NIM_syntagma:0 "The Syntagma"
 NIM_syntagma_desc:0 "Other countries have a list of core rules they call a constitution. We call this practice ‘Syntagma’, or arrangement. By carving some rights and laws in stone, they will be safe against moments of emotion and temporary majorities. With their rights protected, citizens can feel safe in our democracy."

 NIM_diversify_recruitment:0 "Diversify Recruitment"
 NIM_diversify_recruitment_desc:0 "Using the Agoge to train and test young ponies has led to a rigid system where most of the population is disqualified from military service. This is a grave injustice as only few non-pegasi, like Metakeros himself, could make it through the system. Although we might lose some army quality by changing this, we will most certainly give our army potential to grow beyond its current size."

 NIM_nimbusianism:0 "Nimbusianism"
 NIM_nimbusianism_desc:0 "Our culture has wrongly always been about pegasi soldiers, but there is so much more. Let us emphasise the art, architecture, philosophy, poetry, democracy our culture has made. Perhaps our people will realise that the different races and classes all belong together so that Nimbusia can finally prosper!"
 
 NIM_citizenship_for_non_citizens:0 "Citizenship for Xenoi"
 NIM_citizenship_for_non_citizens_desc:0 "There exists a more hidden class in our society, the xenoi, or strangers. Immigrants, merchants and outcasts who fall outside any sort of law. These ponies are always wary of discrimination and unjust persecution. No more! We shall bring these hardworking foreigners into society as citizens."

 NIM_expand_the_curriculum:0 "Expand the Curriculum"
 NIM_expand_the_curriculum_desc:0 "The idea of intensive education as allowed by the Agoge is not necessarily a bad one, but the focus of training is wasteful. Only strength, constitution and martial skills are trained, in a world that is all about economy, industry and trade. By giving our children a better and more diverse education, we will broaden our horizons."

 NIM_strength_in_diversity:0 "Strength in Diversity"
 NIM_strength_in_diversity_desc:0 "Nimbusia is finally moving beyond the era of discrimination by the pegasi-soldier class. More and more ponies dare participate in political life and even the army. By emphasising diversity, we will be able to move towards a more harmonious society."

 NIM_protect_the_helots:0 "Protect the Helots"
 NIM_protect_the_helots_desc:0 "The Helots, our servants, have been treated appallingly. They do the brunt of physical labour in horrendous conditions, oppressed and terrorised by our military. We should give the helots better rights and make an effort to improve their lot. Nimbusia will be a nice society, even for slaves."

 NIM_citizenship_for_auxilaries:0 "Citizenship for Auxiliaries"
 NIM_citizenship_for_auxilaries_desc:0 "We should offer Helots a way out of servitude. If they join the army and proof their bravery and prowess on the battlefield, why would we oppress them any longer? These freeponies will form a loyal and grateful class, inspiring the rest of the Helots to do better."

 NIM_unicorn_corps:0 "The Unicorn Corps"
 NIM_unicorn_corps_desc:0 "With non-pegasi filling the ranks of our army, we can use their unique powers as well. The magical unicorns will help us on all sorts of fronts. Healing or destruction, their powers will make us even more formidable on the battleground. To be fair, our ancestors were fools not to exploit this magic."

  #foreign policy
 NIM_confrontation:0 "Confrontation"
 NIM_confrontation_desc:0 "The River Coalition has proven to be useless. We had hopes that the other members would learn to appreciate our culture and emulate our martial traditions. Instead, they feast and profit while we train relentlessly for their safety. We should confront the others about this, to save our honour back home."

 NIM_demand_tribute_from_RIV:0 "Tribute for Protection"
 NIM_demand_tribute_from_RIV_desc:0 "River City has proclaimed themselves the leader of the Riverlands. However, they are nothing but pompous xenoi. Nimbusia has been the true protector of the East ever since the battle of Thermoponylae. It is time the Riverponies recognise our superiority."

 NIM_quick_wargoals:0 "Might Makes Right"
 NIM_quick_wargoals_desc:0 "We have the greatest military might on the planet and we should show it. Why wait for an opportune moment to strike? Why bother with flimsy justifications and forged claims? The Nimbusians will fight whoever they see as a worthy opponent, whenever they see fit."

 NIM_strike_at_fed:0 "Subjugate the Riverlands"
 NIM_strike_at_fed_desc:0 "We have given the Riverponies time and patience. They have not listened to our words of warning. They disrespect our culture and our people! They refuse to recognise our endless sacrifice for their safety!\nSo be it. We will show them the true might of Nimbusia."

 NIM_strike_at_griffons:0 "Pick a fight with\nthe Ancient Enemies"
 NIM_strike_at_griffons_desc:0 "The griffons have, ages ago, subjugated part of the Riverlands in their relentless attack on the ponies. Nimbusia has always played on the defensive, instability at home and the sheer distance preventing an assault. However, the oracle has been consulted. Now is the time to strike!"

 NIM_strike_at_BAR:0 "End the Dark Experiments"
 NIM_strike_at_BAR_desc:0 "They speak of dark magic beyond our borders. To the south, the Barrad Magocracy conducts terrible experiments on anypony unlucky enough to find themselves in their grasp. Nimbusia, protector of the Riverlands, cannot stand for this! Muster the pegasi, we fly south!"

 NIM_strike_at_ZES:0 "Kick the Zebras of the Continent"
 NIM_strike_at_ZES_desc:0 "The Zebras to the south have been raiding and enslaving their neighbours since they arrived on the southern tip of Griffonia. It is time to send these Zebricans back home to their continent. Their land might serve us well."

 NIM_cautious_cooperation:0 "Cautious Cooperation"
 NIM_cautious_cooperation_desc:0 "Even though we might not get everything we want out of the coalition. Friendship and amicable relations will serve us well. Furthermore, if we don’t protect the Riverponies, who will? Defending the Riverlands is our sacred duty!"

 NIM_industry_research:0 "Industrial Cooperation"
 NIM_industry_research_desc:0 "Some of our friends have industrialised to a much greater extent than we have. It is imperative that we catch up with them. Surely they will be willing to help if we ask nicely."

 NIM_border_defences:0 "Border Defence"
 NIM_border_defences_desc:0 "Even though the Riverponies are our allies for now, we can never be too careful. Usually, fortifications are not our way of fighting, but they might just deter an invasion. We noble Nimbusians, of course, are willing to make this investment to keep the peace."

 NIM_integration:0 "Integration"
 NIM_integration_desc:0 "We share a bond and a common cause with the River Coalition. We fought together against the griffons and we fight together to create a better future for everypony in Eastern Griffonia. We will overcome our distrust of others and cooperate fully with our friends and partners."

 NIM_increase_trade:0 "Encourage Trade"
 NIM_increase_trade_desc:0 "Nimbusia has much to offer its friends. We do not only possess a formidable military, but also luxury goods and resources in ample supply. We need to make sure the other countries actually know that we are open for business and accommodate traders, by launching a charm offensive in foreign media."

 NIM_joint_exercises:0 "Joint Exercises"
 NIM_joint_exercises_desc:0 "The other countries have much to learn from Nimbusian drillmasters and officers. By letting them in on some of our secrets, they will be able to better defend themselves against the griffons. Maybe, just maybe, we will learn something as well. . ."

 NIM_licences:0 "Licensed Production"
 NIM_licences_desc:0 "Some countries are ahead of us technologically. It makes sense to import foreign designs and produce them ourselves. By appealing to our friends and showing our progressiveness, we might be able to get a better deal."
 
 NIM_foreign_advisors:0 "Foreign Military Advisors"
 NIM_foreign_advisors_desc:0 "We shall send attaches to all members of the River Coalition. With our help, their militaries might be able to better coordinate and learn from any combat situations they encounter. It took a while to find officers who were willing to go, but the knowledge we gain ourselves will also be invaluable."
 
 #Slave Revolt
 
 NIM_Slave_Revolt_Wins:0 "Triumph of the Helots"
 NIM_Slave_Revolt_Wins_desc:0 "The Helots of Nimbusia have long been oppressed by our cruel overlords, but as our victorious army marches through Nimbusi, we Helots have finally realized our dream of true freedom.\nHowever, there remains one small problem that we have yet to deal with, how do you actually run a country?\nSurely it can't be that hard, right?"
 
 NIM_Political_Vaccum:0 "The Political Vacuum"
 NIM_Political_Vaccum_desc:0 "We now lead a country, and are sadly required to enter the dreary world of "politics". Unfortunately most of the politicians and experts lie dead. This problem needs to be dealt with."
 
 NIM_Exile_Nimbusians:0 "Exile the Nimbusans"
 NIM_Exile_Nimbusians_desc:0 "The remaining Nimbusans in our custody pose no real threat to us. We can't really be bothered with keeping them all under lock and key. Thus, the solution is simple - we kick them all out"
 
 NIM_Kill_Nimbusians:0 "Kill em All"
 NIM_Kill_Nimbusians_desc:0 "The simplest solution to a problem is often the best one, the Nimbusans lived by the sword, it is only fitting that they die by the sword."
 
 NIM_Traditional_Counties:0 "Traditional Counties"
 NIM_Traditional_Counties_desc:0 "While the previous rulers of Nimbusa might have been cruel and oppressive, the traditional organization of the counties was not inherently flawed. Keeping them as they are is surely the right decision. In addition, a massive upheaval in the administrative structure of Nimbusa might not be the best idea at this time."
 
 NIM_New_Counties:0 "New Counties"
 NIM_New_Counties_desc:0 "Nimbusa was organized into several distinct counties during the rule of the Citizens, and memories of the cruel oppression we suffered during that long period are still fresh in many minds.In order to make sure that no trace remains of the previous administration, we will redraw the counties. Most of them were badly drawn anyways."
 
 NIM_Hold_Elections:0 "The First Helot Election"
 NIM_Hold_Elections_desc:0 "The ability to participate in the elections of Nimbusa has long been a closely guarded privilege of the Citizens. The very idea of helots participating in such events seemed ridiculous just a few years ago. But as the first truly free elections of Nimbusa draw closer and closer, our long-held dream of true equality seems within our grasp."
 
 NIM_Economic_Collapse:0 "The Economic Collapse"
 NIM_Economic_Collapse_desc:0 "The economy is dependent on slave labour, a fact that our recent ban on slave labour has revealed. This has presented several problems, notably economic collapse. This should probably be addressed"
 
 NIM_Redistribute_Wealth:0 "Redistribute the Wealth!"
 NIM_Redistribute_Wealth_desc:0 "The Citizens and Perioeci have long held the vast majority of the wealth of Nimbusia, but with [Root.GetLeaderName] ascent we have finally gained the opportunity to balance the scales. The helots shall receive their just share, it is only right."
 
 NIM_Nationalisation:0 "Nationalization"
 NIM_Nationalisation_desc:0 "While it may be tempting to finally give the wealth the Citizens and Perioeci have long hoarded to our fellow helots, it's probably not the best way to help our devastated economy. It is a far better idea to put the former assets of the upper classes to work so that we can at the very least try to reverse this massive economic downturn."
 
 NIM_Market_Investment:0 "Market Investments"
 NIM_Market_Investment_desc:0 "One of the many varies problems our economy currently faces is the lack of any investment, be it local or foreign, into our economy. In order to solve this problem we will attempt to attract foreign investors to Nimbusa, whatever the temporary costs to our economy may be."
 
 NIM_Protectionism:0 "Protectionism"
 NIM_Protectionism_desc:0 "We might have located a solution to our desperate lack of funds, tariffs. Large amounts of goods go through our borders and isn't it only fair that we get a share of the vast amount of wealth that goes through Nimbusia. The other members of the river coalition may object, but what can they really do to us."
 
 NIM_Open_For_Business:0 "Open for Business"
 NIM_Open_For_Business_desc:0 "It looks like things are finally looking up for our economy, as the people slowly start to go to work, Nimbusa is open for business."
 
 NIM_Army_of_Slaves:0 "An Army of Slaves"
 NIM_Army_of_Slaves_desc:0 "The upper classes of Nimbusa might have touted their superior training and warrior spirit, but the fact remains that our humble army of helots ultimately triumphed over them. But an army of slaves is hard to manage, and we will have to make some hard decisions in the future."
 
 NIM_Fight_Criminals:0 "Fight the Criminals"
 NIM_Fight_Criminals_desc:0 "The Citizens and Perioeci used their tyrannical police force to oppress us during their reign, but we will not use the tools of our oppressors! We will have our glorious army fight crime, thus eliminating the need for a police force. There is no possible way this can go wrong."
 
 NIM_Reorganise_Police:0 "Reforming the Police"
 NIM_Reorganise_Police_desc:0 "While the fact remains that the police were used as an unjust tool of repression before, a society cannot thrive without some way of enforcing the law. By reforming the police force will can ensure  that their judgments are truly just and fair for all parties involved."
 
 NIM_Demobilise:0 "Demobilization"
 NIM_Demobilise_desc:0 "While it might be tempting to draw the vast militias that rose up during the revolt, we can't keep this massive unorganized force under control forever. The militia wants to return to their families, and it is only right that we allow them to."
 
 NIM_Integrate_Militia:0 "Integrating the Militias"
 NIM_Integrate_Militia_desc:0 "We have at our disposal vast amounts of troops ready to defend our new nation. To ensure that the oppression that we so long endured can never happen again we must make sure that our military is up to snuff. Why throw away this massive boon, with the power of the militias we will be unbeatable!"
 
 NIM_Strong_United:0 "Stronger United"
 NIM_Strong_United_desc:0 "We have finally managed to sort out our armed forces, and have started the process of transforming our ragtag army into a truly professional force. We shall never suffer the oppression we endured again, and anyone who tries to attack us shall suffer the fate of our masters."
 
 NIM_New_Nimbusia:0 "The New Nimbusa"
 NIM_New_Nimbusia_desc:0 "With the last of the critical problems facing our nation dealt with, the time has come to deal with the other members of the River Coalition. Whatever they may decide to do, our victory can never be erased from the annals of history.\n\nGlory to the Helots!"

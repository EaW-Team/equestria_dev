 NIM_trials_of_the_cyclone:0 "Trials of the Cyclone"
 NIM_trials_of_the_cyclone_desc:0 "At the age of fifteen, every young Nimbusian faces the Trials of the Cyclone. These trials test their strength, loyalty, honesty, dedication and bravery. Only those who pass earn the right to be a citizen - and it makes us all stronger."

 NIM_nimbusian_general_staff:0 "Nimbusian General Staff"
 NIM_nimbusian_general_staff_desc:0 "Through years of military training, combat experience and tradition, the Nimbusian general staff is a force to be reckoned with."

 NIM_boule:0 "The Boule"
 NIM_boule_desc:0 "The Boule is the governing council of Nimbusia made up of 500 citizens randomly selected each year from a pool of candidates chosen by each of the 10 tribes. While this system of government ensures all citizens have a say in the nation's government and almost eliminates corruption, there is a chance that those in power may not be the most capable."

 NIM_boule2:0 "The Boule" #Honour and Virtue - neutrality path
 NIM_boule2_desc:0 "The Boule is the governing council of Nimbusia made up of 500 citizens randomly selected each year from a pool of candidates chosen by each of the 10 tribes. While this system of government ensures all citizens have a say in the nation's government and almost eliminates corruption, there is a chance that those in power may not be the most capable. However, recent reforms have at least made sure that every citizen chosen will act according to the highest standards, those of virtue."

 NIM_boule3:0 "The Boule" #Wisdom Comes With Age - neutrality path
 NIM_boule3_desc:0 "The Boule is the governing council of Nimbusia made up of 500 citizens randomly selected each year from a pool of candidates chosen by each of the 10 tribes. While this system of government ensures all citizens have a say in the nation's government and almost eliminates corruption, there is a chance that those in power may not be the most capable. However, the members of the Boule can draw inspiration from their venerable ancestors, who imbue us with their wisdom, even after their deaths."

 NIM_boule4:0 "The Boule" #boule after dem reforms (exclusive with Ecclesial Democracy)
 NIM_boule4_desc:0 "The Boule is the governing council of Nimbusia made up of 500 citizens elected every two years from candidates running to represent their tribe. This new modern system allows more capable politicians to take a seat in the Boule, it is now liable to political games. To control the actions of this Parliamentary Boule, the Ecclesia still holds some power to curb any extreme decisions."

 NIM_boule_rep:0 "Ecclesial Democracy"
 NIM_boule_rep_desc:0 "Many powers that were delegated to the 500 pony strong Boule before, have instead been given to the Ecclesia. This bastion of direct democracy now has even more power. However, the new laws passed by the reformists also structured debate amongst the assembly and limited speaking time per pony, in order to make the Ecclesia itself a more effective decision-making body. Although the members of the Ecclesia are just everyday ponies, their democratic nature strengthens the bonds of Nimbusian society."

 NIM_fascism_focus_9_idea_desc:0 "The weakling helots are fools, and if we do not keep them in check they will disturb the natural order.

 NIM_helot_rebellion_nim_idea_desc:0 "The traitorous helots have broken away from us, citing our oppression of them as a trigger for all out war. This has sadly deprived us of our essential workforce- we must crush this rebellion if we are to be productive any more."

 NIM_revolt_economy_1:0 "Nonexistent Economy"
 NIM_revolt_economy_1_desc:0 "The Nimbusian economy was annihilated during the revolution and has now practically reverted to a barter system, with the currency losing all value after the mint was looted after the sack of Nimbusi. It will take a true miracle to salvage any shred of the economy."

 NIM_revolt_economy_3_desc:0 "The economy has recovered to a point that could almost be considered normal, as long as you base your definition of normal on a pre-industrial society.

 NIM_revolt_military_1:0 "An Army of Slaves"
 NIM_revolt_military_1_desc:0 "Our armed forces remain as disorganized and chaotic as ever. Petty warlords hold sway over huge amounts of the military. The militias are unruly and largely want to return to their families, and our command structure remains indecipherable."
 NIM_revolt_military_2:0 "An Army of Slaves?"

 nimbusia.1.t:0 "Planting the Seeds"
 nimbusia.1.d:0 "The debate is over and the deliberations and recommendations of the Boule have been sent to the Ecclesia, the citizens' assembly. No matter the strength of the arguments, the mood of the crowd is fickle and the vote could still go either way. Both the faction leaders and the farmers of Nimbusia nervously await the outcome of the vote. The livelihood of the farmers of Nimbusia was at stake, but more importantly, the importance of trade for the emerging economy..."

 nimbusia.2.d:0 "After a passionate debate on ethics, where the actual question was often out of sight due to lengthy allegories and examples, it is up to the Ecclesia to determine what to do with the silver. The Treasurer was seen honouring the Gods of the city to grant the people the wisdom to save the funds. However, as always, many citizens thought of the immediate benefits of expanding industry and creating more jobs."
 nimbusia.2.a:0 "The people choose to invest into the civilian economy."

 ### NIM_city_culture
 nimbusia.3.t:0 "The Citizens' Verdict"
 nimbusia.3.d:0 "The Boule's sessions went together with a spike in anti-foreigner sentiment, especially in the countryside. Now that the deliberations are done, the people have to decide. Many citizens recognise that cooperating with our neighbours is a necessity in these times, nevertheless, many citizens consider the unicorns' behaviour unacceptable. In the end, the Ecclesia votes to..."
 nimbusia.3.a:0 "... promote an open society!"
 nimbusia.3.b:0 "... send the troublemakers home."
 nimbusia.3.c:0 "... call for the arrest of the Wittenlanders!"
 ### NIM_renovate_acropolis
 nimbusia.4.t:0 "Past Glory"
 nimbusia.4.d:0 "The deliberations in the Boule invigorated debates about the destiny of the Akropolis of Nimbusi. For a long time, it was the pride of the country, but budget cuts and negligence left the highest point of the city a shadow of its former self. A lot of soldiers support the idea of a temple to the gods of war, while many older citizens seek to restore the Akropolis. Some of the youngsters, however, consider the project a waste of time and would rather see infrastructure be made with the money."
 nimbusia.4.a:0 "The reformist plan wins,\nthe Akropolis stays as is."
 nimbusia.4.b:0 "The traditionalists get to restore the Akropolis."

 ### NIM_slave_affair
 nimbusia.5.t:0 "The Power of Gossip"
 nimbusia.5.d:0 "The Boule's heated debate elevated what would normally be relegated to agora-gossip to the front of political debate. Of course, many citizens revelled in the scandal, openly declaring how disastrous it was for the morals and values of Nimbusia. Naturally, there were also those that agreed with the reformists, that regardless of the opinions of others, what happens in the bedroom is a private matter."

Keraunoptose is the traditionalist candidate, an old-guard general of Nimbusia who is both respected for his martial knowledge and his virtuous, incorruptible behaviour.

In it, when asked to keep their master's money safe as he leaves to fight, two slaves handle the question very differently. One buries his master's possessions, hiring guards to keep it all safe. The other slave, used the funds to invest in the polis. When the master comes back, he scolds the slave who buried his silver while praising the one that invested the money and turned a profit.\n\nThe Boule applauded Ponetagoras, who graciously bowed. Without even mentioning the actual events once, the orator managed to swing the Boule to the reformist position."
 nimbusia.8.d_neutrality:0 "Speaking slowly and deliberately, Demarescios, the philosopher of the traditionalist faction, gave a moving statement to the Boule. Recalling many tumultuous events in our history, the old pegasus asked at the end of every historical retelling; "How much of this would have been avoided if our ancestors had silver for emergencies?"\n\nAt the end the Boule's members almost unanimously agreed with Demarescios that the silver should be saved. However, the issue was still up for a vote in the Ecclesia, the citizens' assembly."
 nimbusia.8.d_fascism:0 "Speushippos addressed the Boule with great confidence. Completely foregoing rhetoric about saving or investing, the pegasus instead focused on a battle he knew he could win. Speushippos talked at length about the many conversations he had with soldiers and even generals about bravery. Bravery, then, was a virtue naturally in the middle between foolhardiness and cowardice. Of course Nimbusia's soldiers could never be accused of cowardice, but what of foolhardiness? Was going in to battle with outdated guns and without modern equipment foolhardy? Speushippos left it to the others to contemplate that question.\n\nWhen the philosopher was done, the Boule voted to recommend the Ecclesia to vote for a military investment program!"

With arguments, clever use of words and sheer charisma, he has gotten many ponies acquitted in his career. His opponents knew this and tried all sorts of disruptive tricks to prevent the reformist from speaking. However, the Boule's praesidium caught on to this and allowed Ponetagoras to deliver his oration.\n\nThe philosopher started praising Nimbusian wine and by weaving myth and reality together, he suggested that Nimbusian wine was indeed ambrosia, the drink of the Gods! Even most of his opponents had to admit that saying otherwise would be blasphemy. And that was precisely what Ponetagoras wanted to hear. Continuing his argument, the pegasus argued that the Wittenlanders, tasting the divine drink, were merely possessed by the divine spirit. Any actions committed while "drunk" were then merely the will of the Gods. To go against that would be blasphemy as well. Therefore, the Wittenlanders were only guilty for obeying the Gods of Nimbusia!\nAt the end of the day, the Boule had to agree with the reformists..."
 nimbusia.9.d_neutrality:0 "The traditionalists had to pull a couple of tricks to stop the famed reformist lawyer Ponetagoras from speaking. By using some procedural changes, they managed to postpone the reformists' speech by a day, while being able to have Demarescios give his oration today.  In it, the wise pony first stated that the crimes the foreigners committed were light, but the repercussions were large. A society was a close kinship of friends and it could only remain virtuous if the friends trusted each other. The Wittenlanders had broken the trust of the Polis and therefore had to leave the circle of friends.\n\nDemarescios reiterated again, that the group of friends needed to be careful about who to let in, as to keep the group's traditions alive. He said that he bore no ill will against the Wittenlanders, but that they had to be politely instructed to leave Nimbusia. The Boule, then, found themselves agreeing on this, skipping the pleas of the other factions."

To add insult to injury, the Wittenlanders brought their wasteful nature to Nimbusia. If the ponies of Nimbusia were to continue to respect our laws, the government had to make a point. Arrest the unicorns!\n\nAt this point much of the Boule was riled up and emotional, many did not expect Speushippos to use rhetoric, a form of arguing his master Palton despised. While the emotional Boule members drafted a warrant to be voted on by the Ecclesia, the more astute political minds of the country wondered whether Speushippos was not getting influenced more by his patron, Andreia."

 nimbusia.10.d_harmony:0 "The reformists had taken the radical standpoint that the Akropolis should not receive any extra funds. Ponetagoras had the unenviable task to defend this to the Boule, which was mostly in favour of the renovation. When the orator took the stage, he began his talk like he often did, with something seemingly unrelated. Using numbers, he had gathered, Ponetagoras gave a sketch of poverty in the country, even amongst citizens. In fact, the hardships even led to some untimely deaths. With that he came to the Akropolis. Although he praised its beauty and the noble cause of renovation the complex, he had to admit that the state should have other priorities. Now that the Boule knew about the plight of the poorest citizens, could it really justify this prestige project?\n\nRepresentatives from the other parties cried foul, arguing that Ponetagoras was using emotional arguments, but the damage had been done. Many of the councillors indeed knew poorer ponies who were having difficulty scraping together a living. With those images in their mind, they voted to recommend the Ecclesia to use the money on economic means instead."
 nimbusia.10.d_neutrality:0 "Demarescios's faction had choses to support a restoration of the Akropolis, the ancient complex of temples sitting atop the highest point of the city of Nimbusi. This debate was an easy one for the philosopher, since most of the Boule was already on his hooves. The pony merely recounted the ancient founding of the city and how the Gods themselves were responsible for choosing this site for the city. To worship and respect the Gods then, was to ensure prosperity for the city and the country at large.\n\nWhen the other philosophers tried to counter his arguments, Demarescios brought out an old document that was recovered from the archives. In it, the architect of the original works, all those years ago, recounted that he asked the Oracle for advice on the Akropolis's construction and that the Oracle answered that the way it is now would please the Gods greatly. With that revelation, the traditionalist arguments won out in the Boule!"
 nimbusia.10.d_fascism:0 "Speushippos had grand dreams of a state in which everypony was told about a natural order of rulers, soldiers and people. Where everypony would live in harmony and stability. His master Palton taught that to achieve this, the citizens had to be deceived to keep the system in place. Of course lying to the citizenry and instituting a dictatorship weren't the reasons he gave to build a "Temple of War". Instead, Speushippos gave a considered speech where he compared the Gods of Nimbusia and he openly asked the Boule which of them deserved the most reverence by getting a place on the Akropolis.\n\nOf course the philosopher answered his own question by going down the list. The State can only exist, he argued, because of the blessings of the gods of war. Without them, a country would surely be overrun by its enemies. Although the other Gods help make the state what it is, primacy should be given to its protectors. Therefore, the Gods of War deserved the highest spot on the city. Although the other philosophers considered this a thinly veiled attempt to put the military on a pedestal, the Boule was convinced by Speushippos's logic and accepted his proposal."

 nimbusia.11.d_harmony:0 "When the general public and the Boule have an opinion about something, it is not often that somepony dares sail against the wind. However, Ponetagoras is arrogant and has the words to back it up. Thus, the philosopher argued that, in the affair of the Helot and the Citizen, the Boule has no right to intervene.\n\nThe pony stated that who a stallion or a mare sleeps with is private business and that surely nopony, especially no stallion, would want the public watching whenever they shared the blessings of the God of love. This bold claim made almost all of the pegasi present flush red with embarrassment, prompting Ponetagoras to follow his claim up. Arguing that, if the Nimbusians do not want to watch what happens in private, they should also not seek to control it, not even in this case. The orator's speech caused the Boule, still full of blushing ponies, to acknowledge that it would be best if everypony looked the other way."
 nimbusia.11.d_neutrality:0 "The nature of slavery has been a hot topic of debate for centuries amongst Nimbusian scholars. On the surface, the Helots seem the same as any other pony, making it hard to justify slavery from the onset. However, over time many philosophers, seeking to justify the status quo, have argued backwards. Seeing the current situation as the best, they started to think of reasons why Helots aren't the same as others. Demarescios's master, Aristrotle, was known for his great knowledge of the natural world. But he deduced that Helots must have less advanced minds than normal ponies, therefore it was justified to have them as slaves. The great philosopony of old indeed equated it to raising children.\n\nDemarescios, a faithful pupil of Aristrotle, reminded the Boule about this natural state of things in his oration. He, to the approval of the traditonalists present, made clear that like a child being taught not to do wrong, the couple required a public scolding. This would make it so that others did not follow the example of mingling with those who were not mature of spirit..."

From the onset of her plea, it was clear Andreia was already furious. Her narrative, however, was still strong enough to convince the Boule.\n\nArguing that competition exists everywhere in nature, the purist defended that such should be the way with ponies as well. The citizens, through martial training and superior ability, had taken control of society. The weak and lazy Helots, however, lost on all accounts. She argued that these groups were fundamentally opposed to each other, and that the life of a helot was more akin to that of an animal, when compared to that of a citizen. Therefore, the citizen and the helot, by having an affair, committed a crime against nature and should be arrested for it.\n\nWhen she was done, the Boule barely passed her story, many ponies still finding her language too radical."

She has also created quite the controversy for her very vocal support of reforming the Boules and instituting universal suffrage within Nimbusia.\n\nOn opening day, Louloudi took the stage before a crowd composed of a few thousand citizens. In her speech she commemorated the library in the ideals of free-thinking, education, and democracy, publicly expressing a hope that one day these walls would be open to all ponies, regardless of race, class, or political affiliation.\n\nThis speech caused quite a stir and the controversy of the situation was only reinforced when the first group of VIPs entered the library.

He also discussed the dilution of what he called, the pure pegasus lines, by blood from outside species and how the continued crossbreeding of the pony races would one day lead to the demise of Nimbusia.\n\nAfter the discovery of this work, Ponetagoras vehemently denied holding these values, stating that these were the works of a younger and less educated stallion.

At the time, nearly the entirety of Eastern Griffonia laid subjugated under the tyranny of the Griffonian Empire with only Nimbusia remaining free.\n\nThe griffon Emperor, Grover II, launched an expedition into the Nimbusian mountains from the south, leading an army that numbered in the hundreds of thousands. Initially, they experienced much success, driving the meagre forces of Nimbusia back through Paltrotria and Ioaneigha. However, at Raveni the cunning of the newly appointed strategos, Evgeniki Armonia shined through.\n\nShe lured the enemy's armies into assaulting a vanguard formation just south of the city, while she consolidated every able-bodied citizen on the isles to the east. Then as the battle wore on the point of exhaustion, she swiftly deployed her fresh formations south of the Griffon army. Before the armies of Grover II knew what had befallen them, they were stuck between two pony armies. Even though they were still more numerous and better equipped, their organization was shattered and forces swiftly destroyed.\n\nThe damage caused by the Nimbusian expedition was so severe that within the next twenty years, the Griffonian Empire's influence in Eastern Griffonia was completely removed, as their subjects, both pony and non-pony revolted and threw off the shackles of Griffenheim's tyranny.\n\nWhile the stories in Tholoti's Histories have been subjected to critique in terms of authenticity, his tales have managed to remind the Ponies of Nimbusia of the importance of the citizen class and how their nation stood alone against the tyranny of Griffons."

Officers barked orders and postures were kept stiff, as not a single mistake was allowed to permeate through the ranks.\n\nAlong the parade route, citizens, perioikoi, and even helots watched in awe as the formations slowly moved throughout the streets. They were heading towards an inner-city plaza, with great determination.\n\nThe ponies intrigued enough to follow, found that the formations stopped there, standing perfectly still at attention. A crowd began to form on the edges, as a whispered murmur of anticipation oozed through the audience.\n\nA few minutes later, a young officer took the stage adorned in the bronze hoplite armour of old. It was none other than Andreia of the purist faction. She delivered a speech to her troops, praising them for their discipline and professionalism.\n\nHer attention then turned to the crowd as she made them the focus of her dialog.

Yet, when push comes to shove they will rapidly collapse in the face of change, harming Nimbusia violently as they plummet from their perch.\n\nThe purists assume that she speaks of the Helot class and how their radicalization will bring the very downfall of our society, as they take up arms and attempt to burn down the institutions and society which have taken care of them for eons.\n\nNo matter the faction, everypony agrees that this is some very bad news indeed."

 nimbusia.21.d:0 "Today began strangely, as several high-ranking members of Nimbusian society found themselves attacked by the harsh words of a supposed philosopher in Nimbusi.\n\nWhile the philosopher's name is unknown he was reported as being drunken, staggered repeatedly, smelled faintly of filth, and was never far from a cup of wine.\n\nWhat was especially strange was the philosopher's targets, which included literally everypony. He attacked reformer, purist, and traditionalist alike, tearing apart their respective arguments in a concise, intelligent, and factual manner. His insults transcended occupation as soldiers, politicians, merchants and fellow philosophers were not safe from his biting remarks.\n\nWhat's even more shocking, is that not a single soul was able to effectively counter any of his arguments."

 nimbusia.22.d:0 "The reformists and the traditionalists have picked a fight over a growing concern about foreign influence in Nimbusia. Works from far off places like Equestria and Stalliongrad are being consumed by the youth, especially students. While the reformists consider this natural and think that foreign ideas could be adapted into Nimbusian culture, the traditionalists have rallied to defend Nimbusia's own culture. With only limited political resources at their disposal, both parties can still choose to influence the Ecclesia and the Boule with bribes, flatteries and smearing campaigns, for a price."

 nimbusia.23.d:0 "The leader of the reformist faction, the wealthy unicorn merchant known as Metakeros, was about to speak to the Ecclesia. The theatre at Nimbusi was packed with the citizens who were going to vote on the issue at hoof. An entire evening was set aside for the issue of censorship. The unicorn took a deep breath, steeling himself for the task ahead. The political situation was slowly reaching a boiling point and Metakeros didn't even cross the street alone at night anymore, afraid of fanatical opponents. Soon, all of that would be over and Nimbusia would be safe and free again. The unicorn raised his voice...\n\n"Citizens, Nimbusians, we have been brought together to face a grave danger. This foe is not one we can fight with spears or even guns, nay! But yet we have to muster all our courage to stand against it. The danger of which I speak, is tyranny disguised behind a seemingly noble cause!" The very mention of tyranny already riled up the crowd, as Metakeros expected. "Freedom! A word which under the traditionalists has lost all meaning! Citizens, Nimbusians, I do not hold you for fools! I do not seek to control your spirit. When you vote on this matter, do not consider your political faction. Consider if Nimbusia stands for freedom or for tyranny!" Loud cheering and applause broke out from the theatre and Metakeros tried to gauge whether his speech convinced enough ponies. It was going to be close..."

 nimbusia.24.d:0 "Pegalaios trotted towards the stage, giving a quick nod to Metakeros, who took his seat amongst the citizens' assembly. The reformists have been stirring up trouble for some time now. They were idealist and did not fully understand the pillars that stabilised Nimbusian society. With so many dangerous ideas floating around, there was no telling what godless ideology could grip the minds of the ponies. The older stallion reached the stage. He was oh so tired of all this political manoeuvring, but it was the only way to guide the Nimbusians back to the right path.\n\n"Honourable citizens, let me, first of all, thank the respected Metakeros for his words. He is right. This measure does inhibit the freedom of us all. However, for virtuous citizens such as yourself, this measure will not even be felt. For only those of us who stray away from our sacred traditions, however, will be affected. And even they, in the end, when they see that the exclusion of foreign works has cleared their troubled minds, will be thankful." Pegalaios let that sink in, using the time to gather air, "The freedom the reformists are preaching about is not the freedom to choose between virtuous alternatives. The freedom they are seeking, is the freedom to throw Nimbusia into chaos! Stay true to the gods and to the bonds we share and we shall prevail over our internal doubts!" Pegalaios sighed deeply as parts of the crowd cheered him on. Would the citizens stay true, or had this political infighting eroded all trust in the laws and traditions of old?"

Supporters from each of the factions got into arguments and sometimes even brawls. The peaceful polity he so desired was further away than ever before.\n"No," the pegasus whispered to himself. He should not be defeatist. Clearly the political unrest was heading towards a climax. Perhaps a victory today, against the purists, could steer the people away from radical change? The old stallion stops listening to the doubts in his mind and cleared his throat.\n\n"Honourable Citizens, we meet again, this time to discuss a plan brought forward by the ponies known as the purists. They have expressed concern for the safety of the Strategos and seek to install their cronies as bodyguards so that he will be safe from anypony they deem unsuitable. I am concerned as well, but for something dearer to me than even our beloved Strategos' life. It is our dear democracy, which has just received a death threat!" Shouts erupt from the theatre and insults get thrown at Pegalaios from the ranks of the purists. "There is no question here, honourable citizens! Granting anypony their private army is the death of democracy and the first step on the road to tyranny. Let us put a stop to the purist machinations and have our glorious army under command of the citizens!" Pegalaios stepped back and trotted to his seat. On his way, he passed the young Andreia, the purist leader, who seemed unimpressed. Pegalaios felt in his heart that she was obsessed with power..."

Her voice was commanding and in a way it seemed like she was instructing the Ecclesia instead of speaking to it.\n\n"Citizens, I have heard the protests of the aging stallion Pegalaios, but I have found these not only ungrounded, but also offensive. Pegalaios has the gall to call me a tyrant, while I only seek the best for the citizens of Nimbusia! Seeking merely to protect the life of an honourable member of the military is not tyranny. No, those who would risk his life on the basis of rumour and lies are the ones who deserve your righteous anger, citizens." Andreia's challenging words were riling up both her supporters and opponents, which made the officer smirk, she was thoroughly enjoying this. "So noble citizens, it is your duty to safe the Strategos' life from those who plan the demise of our military! We are ready to serve the general, we but require your command!"

Metakeros, the reformist leader, has championed a plan to get the perioikoi the same level of education as citizens, to improve the research potential of the nation.

 nimbusia.31.d:0 "Andreia's heart was pounding in her chest, almost as if it was trying to burst out. Nimbusi had been heating up ever since the last debate of the Ecclesia and she felt her victory was near. She had but to bash the education plan of the reformists and their unicorn leader Metakeros. The very idea of anypony letting themselves be led by a unicorn was making her disgusted. When she took over, there would indeed be much work to do...\n\n"Citizens, friends, we have gathered here tonight for a deliberation on the matter of education. Or at least, that is what you have been led to believe. For the reformists seek to give their lackeys citizenship, so they can control us all. Their weak, despicable perioikoi allies! Those ponies who are obsessed with coins and would rather sell their mothers than to fight a battle!" Andreia felt that she was letting herself go, her rage flowed uncontrollably out of her mouth into the ears of the crowd. "Instead, I seek to strengthen the knowledge of our children. The citizens of Nimbusia are the pride of the Gods and our proposal will ensure that they gain the best possible education. Vote for Nimbusia, or perish from the reformists' weakness." Andreia took a deep breaths, the speech, which almost devolved into her shouting. The Ecclesia was riled up and chanting phrases at her. Had she won already?"

It seemed that his efforts had made the citizens more distrustful of perioikoi, more hateful towards foreigners and more militant. Or were these just the feelings that were already there manifesting themselves against him? He had to stop the purists, if they won this debate, who knows what else they could get away with?\n\n"Honourable citizens, everypony, thank you all for coming. I will cut to the chase, this meeting is about way more than a law about education. It is about determining who gets to participate and who gets excluded. I plan to give the children of those who labour hard for Nimbusia in the bureaucracy, as teachers or as merchants, the same rights as the children of soldiers. Honourable Nimbusians, is that not justice?" Metakeros let the question linger in the air for a few seconds, before continuing. "How much our dear Andreia may wish it, a society cannot persist on soldiers alone. Indeed, it is those that sacrifice their chance at battlefield glory for the good of society who deserve your admiration, honourable citizens. Be wary of letting anger over foreigners or a misplaced sense of superiority guide your gaze away from the truth. Support our wonderful class of perioikoi and grant them education!"

 nimbusia.35.d:0 "It was one of the weirdest cases that ever came before the citizen-court of Nimbusi. A month or so ago, a griffon by the name of Star Chaser had requested entry into the country. However, the bird seemed completely convinced he was, in fact, a pegasus who got lost from his homeland. He considered his beak a muzzle, his claws as hooves and his feathers a mane. Amused and confused by the bird's story, the border guard let "Star Chaser" into the country.\n\nEverypony thought that would be the end of it, just a weird griffon walking around the streets of the city. However, Star Chaser has asked to complete the Trials of the Cyclone, wanting to become a citizen just like his "fellow pegasi." The law did not state what precisely constitutes a pegasus and the griffon seemed both harmless in his intents and a natural talent at combat and flying. But, like everything these days in Nimbusia, the case of Star Chaser got politicised.\n\nThe reformists support the bird taking the Trials of The Cyclone, stating that everypony can become a citizen, not based on race, but based on merit. They see the griffon as an inspiration for the perioikoi, who still lacked their citizenship. The traditionalists do not want a griffon to besmirch the legacy of the holy trials, but promise the bird that he will be treated well if he drops the case. The purists, meanwhile, have capitalised on the always present fears of griffon invasion, stating that Star Chaser is a Griffenheim spy! Regardless, it is up to the court to decide what will happen."

 nimbusia.36.d_sj:0 "It had been a long day in Nimbusia, and the Nation had fundamentally changed during it. The coup of the Purists has succeeded, their methods having proven effective. The Autokrator now rules uncontested, democracy having proved too slow to act in times of crises. It had not truly been his intention to seize power through such a blunt way, but fate had a way of subverting even the best-laid plans. In some sense, he regretted his actions that fateful day, but it was, ultimately a necessary act.\n\nThe Republic had been doomed ‐ better to give it a quick, clean death than let it waste away. One thing is certain in his mind, Nimbusia had narrowly avoided destruction by the hooves of petty politicians and incompetent bureaucrats. The Ecclesia would have debated and voted on whether or not to declare war while an enemy army butchered them where they stood. Nimbusia had to be saved from itself and after younger, more energetic soldiers took their opportunity, they wisely handed power to their new Autokrator. Gylhippos now rules alone, power his only companion, as well as his great burden. But it was one he would happily bear, if it would mean Nimbusia would survive the coming years."

She had not an ounce of regret, order had to be enforced, the correct way of life taught to the sniveling peasants beneath her.\n\nAndreia was truly happy as she seized complete power, and in a way, it had been an inevitability. The will to act was what the purist had in abundance, while the foolish Ecclesia had treasured their debates and their democracy, she had waited. While the delegates argued and bickered over trivial matters, she trained, and when they dared to move against her, she struck. And now that she wielded ultimate power, she could finally realize her ambitions. Life was will to power. Before she had will, now she had power. And she had every intention of using it."

While in saner times, this would be seen as a sigh of great misfortune and misery, the current government of Nimbusia is far removed from any shred of sanity. After an official decree from the government condemning the decadent luxuries that the citizens of Nimbusia had would not be allowed anymore, and in an attempt to appease the gods for their previous decadence, they would all be sacrificed.\n\nIn the cities of Nimbusia soldiers confiscate anything deemed "luxurious", often breaking into buildings to retrieve them. After all the items of indulgence have been secured, they are burned. It matters not what precious paintings and beautiful pottery are destroyed, none are spared the embrace of fire. The flames burn the relics of old Nimbusia to ash. Nimbusian culture dating back to hundreds of years is destroyed in a single instant, books of philosophy and plays critical of the Purist cause are also given to the inferno.

In a letter that can generously be called "Harshly worded," the Nimbusian government has demanded that we pay our "Fair share" of tribute to them, citing the many years we have survived on their protection.

These sets of laws, coming down to a moral code for lawmakers, public officials and soldiers, is aimed to counteract radicalism from both sides of the political spectrum.

The pegasus officer's speech before the Ecclesia was arrogant and already assumed her victory, but the other factions rallied and bonded forces to stop Andreia.

Most soldiers stood down when they found out we had discovered their plans, but Andreia's closest supporters insisted on fighting Scleroanavates and the ponies loyal to him, using a gymnasium as their staging ground. Even though the purists' cause was doomed from the onset of the battle, they fought to the last pegasus, taking many brave Nimbusians with them to the grave. However, when night fell in Nimbusi, the purist coup was thwarted before it could ever really take shape. "

She had prepared the coup to the best of her ability, listing the strategic points and buildings she had to capture in the capital. She only discovered how tense she truly was when her body completely froze after hearing a knock on her front door. Still, Andreia steeled herself and answered the door, half expecting guardsponies who had come to arrest her. However, on her doorstep stood but one pegasus, general Keraunoptose, the chief of army.\n\nThe stallion apologised for coming at such a late hour and Andreia let him in, surprised by his visit. Keraunoptose spoke at length over the dangers of what Andreia was doing, He warned her that a coup did not lead to glory, but to bloodshed between brothers and sisters. He reiterated that he would not stop Andreia and that was when the mare interrupted the general. Calmly, much unlike her usual, she explained that she would not head her warning. Too much was at stake. The honour of the Nimbusian military and the future of the country itself. When she finished, she swore she could spot some resigned sadness in the general's eyes. After the stallion had left, she could not help but feel she had disappointed him.\n\nAndreia could not sleep that night."

Occupying key roads and buildings in the capital, the conspirators, under the leadership of Andreia seemed to pull off a flawless victory. The mare and her supporters underestimated just how much the Nimbusian people loved their democracy. When news of the coup spread throughout the city, a crowd of citizens and perioikoi gathered on the agora, protesting the military government. With so many ponies leaving going out, the small force of conspirators was unable to stop them from coming together.\n\nAndreia herself appeared at the agora, trying to calm down the protesters, but instead she was showered with fruit and stones, forced to flee the square. The ponies then began forcing the purists out of many of the buildings they occupied just this morning. Scattered and without clear leadership, the purists soon shattered and fled Nimbusia. The citizens and perioikoi celebrated the retreat of the would-be dictators. Democracy had won the day!" #not supporting fascists

She told them that the army had found evidence of the other factions rigging votes and conspiring against Nimbusia. She explained that Metakeros was on the payroll of the griffons and that the reformists wished to sell out the country. And indeed no big revolt came.

However, on her doorstep stood but one pegasus, field marshal Gylhippos himself, the chief of army.\n\nThe stallion apologised for coming in at such a late hour, but there was something both of them still had to do. Andreia could not help to glare at Gylhippos's side, where a dagger was sitting in its sheath. The older stallion followed the mare's gaze and smirked. "I am not here to kill you, Andreia. I am here to tie our fates."\n\nAndreia briefly thought about the improper ways that could be interpreted, but she understood what he meant. Gylhippos wanted to take an oath. She took a deep breath and glared sternly at the grey-eyed stallion. "Yes. That would be best."\n\nBoth generals took a while to determine the exact contents of their oath, the dagger on the table between them as they discussed. Andreia felt the last of her doubts melt away in the presence of a great hero like Gylhippos, a stallion both brave and wise.\n\nAs was tradition, the pegasi looked each other in the eye as they recited their oath, calling upon the gods as their witnesses. To seal their promise, the generals both made a small cut in their flesh, a few red drops of blood falling on Andreia's table. It was one of the most intense feelings the mare had ever felt. She was alive, at the zenith of her power and she knew the world would tremble beneath her hooves! One stare at her co-conspirator told Andreia that he felt much the same, although the stallion managed to conceal it much better than herself.

Even though the deck was stacked against him, with many ponies having problems cooperating with the griffon initially. However, the bird's honesty and bravery in the face of adversity earned him the respect of his younger compatriots. At a humble ceremony, as is tradition, the pegasi that passed the trial got given the rights of citizenry. Many of the reformists, who had come out in large numbers to watch Star Chaser gain his rights, cheered on the new citizen and many more were inspired to be just a little less close-minded when they saw a griffon perform the feats many usually thought only a pegasus could accomplish."

To the surprise of everypony, the bird did his best to fit in either way, finding a job as a clerk. It didn't take too long for the ponies of Nimbusi to get used to the griffon who thought he was a pegasus and to accept his presence.

The bird seemed unconvinced of his testimony himself, but that did not stop Star Chaser from admitting to being Friedrich Razorclaw and that griffons could never be ponies, to not even mention become a Nimbusian citizen.

So the stalwart defender of Nimbusia went without praise, although no words were necessary for the pegasus. With him the last thing that bound the factions of Nimbusian politics also vanished.

The Helots have little in common with the citizens of Nimbusia, lacking anything beyond the most basic education, and most subjects of debate are the division of looted wealth or the control of territory in Nimbusi. Whatever debate is had often devolves into brawls between the various factions that now inhabit the Helot-lead Boule.\n\nIt seems that political stabilization is a long way off from the Helots, and some measure of order must be achieved soon, lest the River Coalition intervene. "

 nimbusia_revolt.3.t:0 "The Economic Collapse"
 nimbusia_revolt.3.d:0 "There were several key pillars that held up the economy of Nimbusia. The menial work of the Helots and the mercantilism of the Perioikoi all served to provide a solid economic base. The Helots could be counted on for the simpler tasks, like mining and farming, while the Perioikoi served as the merchants, bureaucrat, and artisans that are necessary for such a society.\n\nBut when the revolution came to Nimbusia those pillars were toppled to the ground and the aftermath erased any remaining shred of the former economic base that was so reliable for the Nimbusians. With most of the Citizens and Perioikoi either dead or in exile the only remaining class is the Helots. And while they might have made good menial laborers, economists they are not.\n\nThe current economy of Nimbusia has almost reverted to pure barter, as the central mint was unfortunately looted and burned during the revolution. The Helots have mostly abandoned their farms and mines, as most prefer to live in the opulent housing that formerly housed the Citizens. In their absence gangs of bandits now occupy many farmsteads, charging exorbitant prices for basic essentials.\n\nBut as the lack of basic necessities like food and water starts to sink in, it has become clear that something must be done soon, lest the entire state collapse into poverty."

 nimbusia_revolt.4.d:0 "The ultimate triumph of the Helot armies over the far better organized, trained and equipped citizen armies of Nimbusia is considered a miracle by most military observers who survived the fighting. What the Helots lacked in training they made up for in numbers ten times over. In fact, it was uncommon for the citizens to be outnumbered 10 to 1 in most battles of the rebellion. But just as an army of slaves has its benefits, so too does it have its detriments.\n\nThe command structure of the army remains as frustratingly unclear to its soldiers as it was during the first days of the rebellion. While the Army had been united against a common foe during that time, after the storming of Nimbusi and the ultimate defeat of the Citizens those bonds were quickly severed.\n\nWhat remains of the army that shattered the warriors of Nimbusia is more akin to a massive gang than any organized military force. The various leaders of the army now rule large portions of the nation through force of arms alone, often extracting tribute from the local inhabitants. The militias remain as reluctant as ever, with many now openly expressing their desire to return to their families.\n\nWith the absence of a proper police force, martial law remains the de-facto rule for the entire country. Small offenses are often punished according to whatever whims the local warlords have at the moment, and many are fearful of the state fracturing even more if nothing is done.\n\nAn army of slaves now occupies Nimbusia, whether they can become something more is a question that remains unanswered."

The letter reads as follows:\n\n"To the new leaders of Nimbusia\n\nThe recent events in Nimbusia have created a large upheaval, both in Nimbusia and in the wider Coalition. Lawlessness and poverty seem ready to consume the Nimbusian region, and as such an official conference has been scheduled to deal with this matter. Be advised that this warning is only a matter of politeness, as Nimbusias representatives within the Coalition have yet to be determined, and as such you will not be provided with the privilege of attending. We hope that this warning will encourage you to establish the rule of law as soon as possible, lest drastic measures are taken.\n\nBest regards\n-The Council of the River Coalition"\n\nThere is little we can do at this point, we are at the mercy of the vultures of the River Coalition that now circle the cadaver of Nimbusia.

In the end, we can only wait and hope for a merciful judgment."

 nimbusia_revolt.8.d:0 "After the conference concluded the River Coalition has officially declared our government a "Detestable gathering of bandits and warlords", the various militaries of the Coalition are now surging across the border, and we seem hopelessly outgunned. It would take a military genius to save us from this mess. But we Helots have faced impossible odds and triumphed, to arms comrades. Perhaps we will die, but if we do it will be as free ponies, glory to the Helots!"

 nimbusia_revolt.9.t:0 "The Nimbusian Reconstruction Authority"
 nimbusia_revolt.9.d:0 "It seems that we have managed to please the vague whims of the Coalition, and our government has been declared legitimate. Although they insist on creating a Nimbusian Reconstruction Authority, which will oversee our every action, effectively turning us into a protectorate of the Coalition, but the fact remains that we have earned our freedom. Shipments of food and water, along with soldiers to help secure the country are already arriving. We made it, we are finally free to return to our homes."

 nimbusia_revolt.10.d:0 "Nimbusia is a society shaped by fear, the fear of a helot revolt. The helots greatly outnumber the citizens of Nimbusia, and a revolt would be disastrous for Nimbusia. But there was never a real danger of a revolt, with the Nimbusians making sure to prevent any such thoughts in the Helots. But the recent massive shifts in Nimbusian society have pushed the Helots to the breaking point. \n\nThis all began when the Helots, to the immense surprise of many, declared a strike. It seems that they had managed to organize themselves under the command of a Helot named Dialusides. Demanding immediate recognition of their rights as ponies, and their complete freedom from servitude. When the Nimbusians responded, they did so through the only method they knew, force.\n\nBut this was not unexpected, the Nimbusians had always made it clear that they would not hesitate to attack the Helots should they rebel. But when the attacks came, they met stiff resistance. The Helots had been hoarding weapons for years, all in preparation for this one chance at freedom. Multiple groups have managed to organize themselves into military units, and now make their way to the capital. Nimbusia is now in a state of civil war, and the old fears of the Citizens are now given shape."

Additionally, our advisers will be present at most levels of government to help them manage the country. Massive shipments of food, water, and other essentials are ready to be delivered to distribution centers across Nimbusia. Nimsuaia was ravaged by the war and the specter of a possible famine still looms over the country. Rebuilding Nimbusia will certainly be a herculean task."
 nimbusia_revolt.11.a:0 "Great!"
 nimbusia_revolt.12.t:0 "The Helot Reply"
 nimbusia_revolt.12.d:0 "It seems that the Helots have not taken our offer of aid very well, claiming that our offer was nothing more than "Naked Imperialism". This has come as a rather large surprise to our government, as most ponies assumed that the Helots had little chance of surviving without external aid. Well, if they want to die on their little hill, we will be happy to assist them."
 nimbusia_revolt.12.a:0 "Those fools."
 nimbusia_revolt.13.t:0 "The Nimbusian Policing Action"
 nimbusia_revolt.13.d:0 "After a thorough review of their policies and recent actions, we have determined that the current "government" of Nimbusia is little more than a collection of petty warlords and bandits. If we are to save any shred of Nimbusia, we will have to remove them from power. While it might seem like their army is weak and untrained, we cannot get overconfident.

 NIM_fascism_focus_14:0 "Revoke The Rights Of Perioikoi"
 NIM_fascism_focus_14_desc:0 "Pegasi are clearly the only ponies fit to have any responsibility. The past struggle for power along with the miserable state of our neighbours' military shows that unicorns and earth-ponies cannot be trusted to do anything independently. No matter, we will guide them."

 NIM_farmer_help:0 "Help for Farmers"
 NIM_farmer_help_desc:0 "The backbone of our society may be our military, but the foundation which keeps it standing is the agriculture which feeds our soldiers. While those who work the farms may be simple Helots, non-citizens, we still must provide support for them in order to guarantee our society's source of food."

 NIM_give_farmers_new_jobs:0 "New Jobs for Farmers"
 NIM_give_farmers_new_jobs_desc:0 "With some of our recent investments into agriculture, an issue has reached our attention. Many Helots have found themselves out of work in agriculture, their labor no longer being necessary. The surplus of jobless Helots is a major issue, as it both represents wasted potential workforce, and a possibly rebellious contingent of serfs. We must quickly put these ponies to work in other forms of work."

 NIM_merchants:0 "Merchants of Nimbusia"
 NIM_merchants_desc:0 "The merchant class of our society may be sparse and disliked, seen as weak and worthless, but they may be of great use to us. They bring to our nation not only goods, but stories- stories of industrial processes, great factories and the many things they produce. While we may avoid frivolities, it is best we don't ignore such things."

 NIM_foreign_factory_tacticts:0 "Foreign Industrial Tactics"
 NIM_foreign_factory_tacticts_desc:0 "One of the greatest weaknesses a warrior may have is stagnation- and the same applies to our society. While we may remain firm in our culture and government, if we are to progress into the modern era and remain relevant, we must adopt foreign techniques for industry. Stagnation is as good as a certain death."

 NIM_hillponies_controltowers:0 "Hillpony Watchtowers"
 NIM_hillponies_controltowers_desc:0 "The hillpony tribes, situated in the interior of our country, have perfectly situated terrain to watch our borderlands. From the hilltops we can construct watchtowers, making sure no fouldoer- whether foreigner or criminal- will go unseen by their vigilant eyes."

 NIM_hillponies_resources:0 "Hillpony Resources"
 NIM_hillponies_resources_desc:0 "The hills of our country can do much more for us than provide vantage points, however. The hills are rich with many minerals, perfect to create tools for our farmers and guns for our soldiers- as well as perhaps to fuel the growth of a true early industry, if we so wish."

 NIM_connect_the_land:0 "Connect the Land"
 NIM_connect_the_land_desc:0 "The lands of Nimbusia have long been separated by harsh terrain, which has lead to a fair share of problems for us and our citizens. If our programs are to be properly integrated, and our citizens and soldiers properly able to traverse through their own nation, we must build up a base of infrastructure to connect our towns."

 NIM_farmers_in_factory:0 "An Industrial Workforce"
 NIM_farmers_in_factory_desc:0 "With our attempts to grow a domestic industry, the issue of what to use as a workforce has come into question. We could never think to use our citizens for such a low task- however, we have an abundance of helots working in agriculture. If we were to transfer some farmers to work in our cities' new factories, we will quickly be able to fulfill the requirements of these new facilities."

 NIM_connect_more_land:0 "Railway Programs"
 NIM_connect_more_land_desc:0 "While our earlier attempts to connect our nation were a success, it was still not enough, and there are still issues traversing our nation. With our newfound industry, we may be able to put a foreign technology to use- the railroad. By connecting major locations with railway lines and adding additional local infrastructure to support these lines, we may finally be able to connect our nation."

 NIM_philosophy:0 "Philosophic Traditions"
 NIM_philosophy_desc:0 "Our society was formed not by the blade, but with words. From the beginning of Nimbusia, logic and philosophy have been valued just as highly as we value our soldiers. Debates are commonplace, and the ponies of Nimbusia are pioneers in the arts of logic and science."

 NIM_schools_for_everpony_desc_neutral:0 "While the education for the citizens of our nation is great, the same is not true for the majority of our population. While this worked for the Helots when they were primarily farmers, with our new industrial plans it is necessary that we give them basic education in order for them to be able to work in our factories. Of course, we have to be careful not to educate them too much."
 NIM_schools_for_everpony_desc_harmony:0 "We value the education of our citizens greatly, and it has always been something the government supported. However, for many years our nation has ignored another portion of our population who needs education- the Helots. Most Helots cannot even read, much less know about any further subjects. If we are to help create a fair society, we must begin by at the very least giving the Helots basic education."
 NIM_schools_for_everpony_desc_fascist:0 "The Helots we have attempted to put to work in our factories have been nothing short of incompetent- no doubt in part because of their lack of any education. While we would never dream of properly educating the Helots, perhaps we could put into place schools to help them learn the skills to work in factories- and perhaps help them remember who their betters are."

 NIM_back_in_business:0 "Back in Business"
 NIM_back_in_business_desc:0 "Our nation has taken a turn for a better, and many ponies who were once impoverished have found their place in the new industrial society we are creating. Our ambitious programs of industrialisation have had a great positive effect on our nation, and our industrial strength is beginning its exponential growth."

 NIM_industry_might:0 "Industrial Research"
 NIM_industry_might_desc:0 "With the growth of our industry, our capability to research grows as well. No longer needing to import scientific tools and with larger funding, our researchers have begun to expand their scope further."

 NIM_modern_industryies:0 "A Modern Industry"
 NIM_modern_industryies_desc:0 "While we are far from the industrial might of some far-off nations, our potential is great. With proper care, our fledgeling industry can be nurtured into a mighty and modernised industrial sector, and our nation can thrive."

 NIM_theater:0 "Theatre"
 NIM_theater_desc:0 "The theatre is an old and well-loved tradition in Nimbusia, where ponies gather to watch performances of epics, tragedies, and other great oratary works. Promoting nation-wide theatres both would bolster government support and bring more cultural uniformity to our nation."

 NIM_hillponies_in_factorys:0 "Hillpony Workers"
 NIM_hillponies_in_factorys_desc:0 "The hillpony tribes have an excess of workers, and our local factories need a workforce. We must encourage more hillponies to work in our factories, or else we may run out of labor to fuel our ever-growing industry."

 NIM_mines:0 "Hillpony Miners"
 NIM_mines_desc:0 "The hillponies, well suited to the hills they call home, make perfect candidates to use as labor in mines. With good enough pay as incentive, surely we will be able to make good use of the resources in the hills with the use of the local workforce."

 NIM_millitary_begining:0 "Blacksmiths to Factories"
 NIM_millitary_begining_desc:0 "In the past we have relied on blacksmiths and craftsponies to supply the weapons for our armies, however it is time to make a change to this. With foreign threats growing stronger and the obsolescence of our current military growing more apparent, we must begin the first reforms by upgrading our methods of production."

 NIM_look_into_the_army:0 "Begin Army Reforms"
 NIM_look_into_the_army_desc:0 "While our army is strong, loyal, and one of the most disciplined in the world, it is far from modern. By inviting our highest military staff to contemplate the future of our armed forces, we may be able to create a path to modernisation."

 NIM_new_guns:0 "New Guns"
 NIM_new_guns_desc:0 "Our nation is currently armed with merely muskets- while superior to the primitive swords used by some nations, they still cannot stand up to the weapons used by modern nations. Our soldiers deserve the very best weaponry, and it would not do to leave them with outdated guns."

 NIM_new_artillery:0 "New Artillery"
 NIM_new_artillery_desc:0 "Artillery is a rather useful weapon, allowing us to perform precision strikes on enemy positions from a safe distance. While some traditionalists have brought up concerns about artillery being a cowardly weapon, its effectiveness is undeniable."

 NIM_new_battle_plans:0 "New Theory"
 NIM_new_battle_plans_desc:0 "The outdated strategies of old have proven to be next to worthless in the face of a modern army, and we must entirely change our way of thinking about war in order to fix this blatant flaw with our military."

 NIM_mountain_fighters:0 "Mountain Guns"
 NIM_mountain_fighters_desc:0 "The hilly and mountainous landscape of our nation and the surrounding lands proves to be a challenge for warfare, however it is also something we may use to our advantage. We can design specialised ordinance to use in mountainous terrain, able to be moved easily throughout the rough terrain to take up superior positions."

 NIM_improve_officers:0 "Officer Training"
 NIM_improve_officers_desc:0 "Our current general staff is one of the greatest the world has to offer- something admired by many of our neighbours. However, our current generals will not live forever, and we cannot let such knowledge die with them. In order to both further improve our officers and assure new officers are up to standards, we must establish officer schools, where veterans may train new officers in the discipline of warfare."

 NIM_glory_to_the_army:0 "Glory to the Army!"
 NIM_glory_to_the_army_desc:0 "Any true Nimbusian supports our glorious army, and we must make sure to keep it that way. Instead of letting our military sit idle until war, we can make use of it in order to fuel itself- military parades and other showcases of our military strength fill the citizen's hearts with pride, project our power, and keep our soldier's disciplined. As such, we should increase the frequency of such endeavors."

 NIM_improve_spec_ops:0 "Special Operative Training"
 NIM_improve_spec_ops_desc:0 "We currently train all of our soldiers with the same methods, providing little room for the training of special forces. If we expand our training to allow special programs for such soldiers, however, we may see a marked increase in their performance."

 NIM_war_makes_smart:0 "War Makes Progress"
 NIM_war_makes_smart_desc:0 "We are not afraid of war, as some fools are. While many see war as a purely destructive force, we know otherwise- war breeds progress in many ways, and the fields of battle are always where you will find the world's latest inventions in play."

 NIM_more_factorys:0 "Military Development"
 NIM_more_factorys_desc:0 "We have already begun to produce our weaponry in specialised factories, but said factories are few. We must put our money and helots to work in producing more factories and more weapons for our army, or else we may find ourselves unprepared for war."

 NIM_air_force:0 "Aerial Warfare"
 NIM_air_force_desc:0 "In our efforts to modernise, we must not ignore the entirely modern ways of war. We have heard that control of the skies is crucial in modern war, and we must not put such information to waste- the development of an air force, at the very least for defence."

 NIM_sky_hunters:0 "Sky Hunters"
 NIM_sky_hunters_desc:0 "The pegasi of Nimbusia have long been accustomed to the air, but they are mostly useless in warfare. These same pegasi- the expert fliers of our nation- would make perfect candidates to fly in our new air force, however. These recruits need a plane to fly in, and as such we quickly need to produce a modern design for a fighter plane, with which to wrest control of the skies."

 NIM_naval_force:0 "Assess the Navy"
 NIM_naval_force_desc:0 "Our navy, although being overlooked by some in favor of our army, is still a mighty force. If we are to begin changes to the navy, we must first assess our current situation. With the help of our naval officers, we shall establish a plan for the future of our navy."

 NIM_bomber:0 "Bomber Production"
 NIM_bomber_desc:0 "Tactical bombers are a flexible type of plane which allow for us both to support ground troups and damage the enemy's land. While many in our nation have frowned apon bombing as a dishonorable and cowardly way to war, it still may be useful to know how to create them."

 NIM_heavy_bomber:0 "Heavy Bombers"
 NIM_heavy_bomber_desc:0 "Some researchers have come up with a new model of bomber- a bigger fighter, with a much larger payload and focus on destroying the enemy's homefront rather than support for troops. While not the most honorable form of warfare, we should keep our options open."

 NIM_heavy_fighter:0 "Heavy Fighters"
 NIM_heavy_fighter_desc:0 "Heavy fighters are a more production-heavy, stronger and more powerful form of fighter. Designed to escort bombers, and as such having increased range, these fighters are heavier and require more fuel and resources, but also carry far heavier firepower to match."

 NIM_more_hunters_in_the_sky:0 "More Hunters in the Sky"
 NIM_more_hunters_in_the_sky_desc:0 "The core of an air force is its fighers- an air force can function with only fighters, but not without them. By focusing on outproducing the opponent in fighters, we will be able to permanently control the skies, allowing for any other operations to be completed smoothly."

 NIM_jets_rocketo:0 "Rocketry Experiments"
 NIM_jets_rocketo_desc:0 "Rocketry is a rather foreign technology, but it seems to have fascinated a few of our researchers. A small group of these scientists have come to us asking for a grant in order to develop rocket technology for military application. While this may turn out to be useless, it may be a worthy addition to our arsenals."

 NIM_carries:0 "New Carriers"
 NIM_carries_desc:0 "Our current carrier model functions well enough, but falling behind is never an acceptable option- we must constantly modernise our navy to assure the control of our seas."

 NIM_destroyers:0 "New Destroyers"
 NIM_destroyers_desc:0 "Building more capital ships is of no use if we have nothing to escort them. New destroyer models to keep our capital ships safe is a necessary time investment."

 NIM_dockyards:0 "Stratos Dockyard"
 NIM_dockyards_desc:0 "The funding of a large dockyard project in Stratos has been suggested to us by a few naval officers. The city's location nearby the capital and along a small peninsula positions it perfectly to be used as the staging point for our quickly increasing naval production and force projection."

 NIM_carrier_planes:0 "Planes for our Carriers"
 NIM_carrier_planes_desc:0 "Our naval officers have focused on the production of carriers, but these carriers are of little use without planes to fill them. We must create a new arsenal of fully modern carrier aircraft to accompany our capital ships on the sea."

 NIM_oil_rigs:0 "Offshore Oil Rigs"
 NIM_oil_rigs_desc:0 "Oil has been discovered in the oceans off our coasts, and this is a fantastic economic opportunity. Not only are many foreign nations willing to pay well for oil, but it can be put to use for domestic industrial development and production, as well as fueling our ships."

 NIM_submarine:0 "Submarines"
 NIM_submarine_desc:0 "Submarines, a class of ship overlooked by the majority of our naval officers, may be something to consider for future naval projects. If we are to ever clash with a nation reliant on foreign resources, we can use submarines to disrupt their trade routes."

 NIM_cruissers:0 "Modern Cruisers"
 NIM_cruissers_desc:0 "Cruisers- both an alternative for capital ships and a way to escort them- are a fine balance between smaller and larger ships, while still being relatively cheap to create. Considering the state of our industry, it may be best to focus on more modest ships such as these for the time being."


 #traditionalist victory
 NIM_polity:0 "Politeia"
 NIM_polity_desc:0 "The polity is our society, based around the poleis, or cities. More than just a bunch of buildings, a polity is a cooperation of many different ponies in a way they are used to. It is where citizens can grow into their potential, a home away from the normalcy of the household. We will make sure nopony can threaten this tradition."

 NIM_honor_and_virtue:0 "Honour and Virtue"
 NIM_honor_and_virtue_desc:0 "It is high time that the citizenry begins to act according to the principles we all hold high. We will act according to our honour and treat each other with respect.

 NIM_ostracise_purists:0 "Ostracise the Purists"
 NIM_ostracise_purists_desc:0 "Some of the purist leadership is refusing to see that they lost, even now. Luckily, our illustrious forefathers put a system in place to neutralise threats to democracy. We will call forth the Ecclesia and order a vote to ostracise these dangerous radicals. Perhaps a banishment to foreign lands will help temper their spirits."

 NIM_discipline_the_army:0 "Discipline the Army"
 NIM_discipline_the_army_desc:0 "With their leaders out of the way, the purists are disorganised. They still hold sway over some of the army, however, and we must intervene. We will enact harsh disciplinary measures to get the army under control. The citizens run the country, not the military and we should ensure it stays that way."

 NIM_marginalise_reformists:0 "Marginalise the Reformists"
 NIM_marginalise_reformists_desc:0 "Although the reformists mean well, their idealism goes against both tradition and political reality. We should call the reformists out on their ultra-progressive ideas and weed some of their supporters away. With Metakeros's faction out of the picture, we will be free to enact further reforms."

 NIM_tax_non_citizens:0 "Tax the Perioikoi"
 NIM_tax_non_citizens_desc:0 "With the reformists out of the way, we should make sure the state profits from the enterprises the perioikoi have been setting up. Since they don't have political rights, some ponies thought it would be best to not tax them fully. However, these ponies should contribute to the polity as well."

 NIM_experience_of_the_ages:0 "Experience of the Ages"
 NIM_experience_of_the_ages_desc:0 "Nimbusia is an old state that has fought many conflicts, both political and martial. Let us remember the tales of old and use those traditions to make ourselves more powerful at present. The craftsponies, shipwrights and the hoplites still have much to learn from the poets and philosophers of old."

 NIM_more_land_for_soldiers:0 "Expand the Katoikiai"
 NIM_more_land_for_soldiers_desc:0 "The Katoikiai, homes for military colonists, are a way to both project our power in the countryside and increase the number of soldiers at our command. We can never have enough pegasi, so new poleis which can sustain themselves, will provide us with more soldiers and potential for industry."

 NIM_consult_the_oracle:0 "Consult the Oracle"# Different duplicate from Eaw
 NIM_consult_the_oracle_desc:0 "In ancient times, the Oracle at Prancetras was held in the highest esteem, since she provided wisdom from the gods themselves.

 NIM_honor_the_ancestors_desc:0 "The battle of Thermoponylae has been the unifying moment for our nation and one we should never forget. However, the plaque remembering the event has been lost.

 NIM_tradition_of_sacrifice:0 "Tradition of Sacrifice"
 NIM_tradition_of_sacrifice_desc:0 "In dire times, the Nimbusi are not afraid to make harsh sacrifices.

True nobility is not Wittenlander extravagance, but Nimbusian Temperance."

 NIM_wisdom_age:0 "Wisdom Comes With Age"
 NIM_wisdom_age_desc:0 "Sofia, lady wisdom, is true knowledge of virtues and the world around us. It is reference for the Gods who rule all aspects of life and excellence at preforming one's duties.

 NIM_with_your_shield_desc:0 "A Nimbusian mother once told her son, who was doubting his own bravery, what he ought to do. "Come back with your shield, or upon it." It is a very simple definition of bravery, but one that all our soldiers must follow. Nimbusians will never surrender!"

 NIM_martial_culture:0 "Martial Culture"
 NIM_martial_culture_desc:0 "We have honed the martial society which is our pride. The Nimbusian soldier is the envy of the known world. Disciplined and without equal. Skilled and unrelenting. The pegasi soldiers of Nimbusi will fight for their homes!"

 NIM_free_mind:0 "Cultivating a Free Mind"
 NIM_free_mind_desc:0 "Ponies are not born with a free mind. Critical thinking, tolerance, open-mindedness, these things need to be taught.

 NIM_industrial_grants:0 "Industrial Grants"
 NIM_industrial_grants_desc:0 "To keep up with modern times, we will have to build up our industry to match those of our friends and our enemies. Luckily, there is much unused potential in Nimbusia and once we start to get the ball rolling, the free market will take care of the rest."

 NIM_rein_in_the_military:0 "Rein in the Military"
 NIM_rein_in_the_military_desc:0 "We will need to spend time and effort to curtail pegasi-superiority extremism in our military. Rather than being our guardians, these warmongers are the worst threat to peace. A combination of soft-spoken persuasion and harsh punishment will make the pegasi fall in line and march to the drumbeat of progress instead."

 NIM_elections_for_the_boule:0 "Elections for the Boule"
 NIM_elections_for_the_boule_desc:0 "With our large population and territory, a direct democracy is simply unsustainable. Instead, we should transform the Boule into an elected body of representatives. This will make it easier to pass laws and will strengthen democracy. Of course the Ecclesia will still be heard on the most important issues, but we cannot rely on it anymore."

 NIM_power_to_the_ecclesia:0 "Strengthen the Ecclesia"
 NIM_power_to_the_ecclesia_desc:0 "Even if we'd like to take the easy path and restrict direct democracy to increase effectiveness, we should not. Ponies are political animals and we will only find satisfaction if we can debate and decide the course of the community. The Boule should be marginalised and the Ecclesia strengthened, so that we may utilise the wisdom of all citizens!"

 NIM_syntagma:0 "The Syntagma"
 NIM_syntagma_desc:0 "Other countries have a list of core rules they call a constitution. We call this practice "Syntagma", or arrangement. By carving some rights and laws in stone, they will be safe against moments of emotion and temporary majorities. With their rights protected, citizens can feel safe in our democracy."

 NIM_diversify_recruitment:0 "Diversify Recruitment"
 NIM_diversify_recruitment_desc:0 "Using the Agoge to train and test young ponies has led to a rigid system where most of the population is disqualified from military service. This is a grave injustice as only few non-pegasi, like Metakeros himself, could make it through the system. Although we might lose some army quality by changing this, we will most certainly give our army potential to grow beyond its current size."

 NIM_nimbusianism:0 "Nimbusianism"
 NIM_nimbusianism_desc:0 "Our culture has wrongly always been about pegasi soldiers, but there is so much more. Let us emphasise the art, architecture, philosophy, poetry, democracy our culture has made.

These ponies are always wary of discrimination and unjust persecution. No more! We shall bring these hardworking foreigners into society as citizens."

 NIM_expand_the_curriculum:0 "Expand the Curriculum"
 NIM_expand_the_curriculum_desc:0 "The idea of intensive education as allowed by the Agoge is not necessarily a bad one, but the focus of training is wasteful. Only strength, constitution and martial skills are trained, in a world that is all about economy, industry and trade. By giving our children a better and more diverse education, we will broaden our horizons."

 NIM_strength_in_diversity:0 "Strength in Diversity"
 NIM_strength_in_diversity_desc:0 "Nimbusia is finally moving beyond the era of discrimination by the pegasi-soldier class. More and more ponies dare participate in political life and even the army. By emphasising diversity, we will be able to move towards a more harmonious society."

 NIM_protect_the_helots_desc:0 "The Helots, our servants, have been treated appallingly. They do the brunt of physical labour in horrendous conditions, oppressed and terrorised by our military.

 NIM_citizenship_for_auxilaries:0 "Citizenship for Auxiliaries"
 NIM_citizenship_for_auxilaries_desc:0 "We should offer Helots a way out of servitude.

 NIM_Nationalisation_desc:0 "While it may be tempting to finally give the wealth the Citizens and Perioeci have long hoarded to our fellow helots, it's probably not the best way to help our devastated economy.

Despite leaning towards the Nimbusian traditional clique, Iódis appreciates being sent to the other Riverland nations as an attaché, giving her an opportunity to learn more about the various cultures that permeate the region."

### Ideas ###
PYT_the_peasant_republic:0 "The Peasant Republic"
PYT_the_peasant_republic_desc:0 "The Republic of Peasants was founded in 720 ALB after the peasantry rose up against Duke Erebus Blacktalon - one of Grover I's many early political opponents. The Emperor rewarded the peasantry by allowing them to organise their own government.\n\n Thus Greifenmarschen was created, a peculiar nation even by Griffonian standards. It can safely be called the first Republic on the continent, but it can also be considered the most flawed Republic on the continent.\n\n Operating on the principles of total equality and liberty for all of its citizens, quite literally every single minor thing in Greifenmarschen is voted on, and while this system evokes an unmatched sense of loyalty to the Republic it also means that implemeting any sort of reforms will be nigh impossible."
PYT_the_peasant_army:0 "The Bauernmiliz"
PYT_the_peasant_army_desc:0 "Greifenmarschen's Army or rather the Bauernmiliz suffers from many of the same issues that its government does. Officers and plans are voted upon, any sense of discipline is nonexistent, and any reforms are hard to pass.\n\n On the bright side there is no shortage of eager recruits ready and willing to defend their beloved Republic."
PYT_rural_economy:0 "Ruralism"
PYT_rural_economy_desc:0 "The nature of Greifenmarschen's government and people has made it rather hard to create any proper industrial centers, as such most of our economy is reliant on farming and mining."

### Focuses ###
PYT_initial_army_reforms:0 "Reforming the Bauernmiliz"
PYT_initial_army_reforms_desc:0 "For decades now the army of the Republic has remained untouched, becoming increasingly outdated in this age of innovation and revolution. Our faction has finally managed to gather enough supporters who will approve any proposals we might make, but it remains to be decided how exactly the army will be reformed."
PYT_militia_roots:0 "Perfect As Is"
PYT_militia_roots_desc:0 "Our peasant militias have bravely and reliably defended the country from foreign incursions for centuries now, holding the river banks and crushing any noble fool who tried to subdue us. Why change the wheels of a working wagon?"
PYT_call_to_arms:0 "A Call to Arms"
PYT_call_to_arms_desc:0 "The Bauernmiliz is a purely voluntary force, but that fact does not mean that we can not ask our citizens to volunteer. There are surely thousands of willing griffons ready to fight for their country, we need only to put out the word."
PYT_actual_conscription:0 "Fight For Your Home"
PYT_actual_conscription_desc:0 "While the Bauernmiliz may not be as professional a force compared to the other militaries of Griffonia, they do possess their own distinct advantage. They will fight for their homes, their families and their country. And, if nessicary, they will die for their homes."
PYT_guerilla_warfare:0 "From the Shadows"
PYT_guerilla_warfare_desc:0 "The Bauernmiliz is not only consigned to our official divisions but rather is comprised of thousands of small cells operating out of our territory. Regardless of our defeat on the battlefield, the Bauernmiliz will continue the fight behind enemy lines, striking from the shadows until they can be liberated by our forces."
PYT_actual_guns:0 "The Right Tools"
PYT_actual_guns_desc:0 "If the Bauernmiliz are to fight on the battlefield, they will need the right tools for the job. There are thousands of citizens who hold surplus weapons and tools, and many would gladly donate them to the Bauernmiliz."
PYT_train_our_troops:0 "Proper Training"
PYT_train_our_troops_desc:0 "By accelerating and streamlining our training regimen we can ensure that the next batch of recruits reaches the front faster and better trained."
PYT_born_of_the_land:0 "Born of the Land"
PYT_born_of_the_land_desc:0 "Our soldiers all have an incredible amount of experience with the land and terrain of our homeland, acquired through generations working and developing the land. We can gather these techniques together to ensure that our forces can subsist in even the harshest conditions."
PYT_stock_the_villages:0 "Stock the Villages"
PYT_stock_the_villages_desc:0 "We must be ready for conflict, and many of our villages are perfect spots for storing equipment for use in emergencies. We can also encourage local production of weapons to further increase our self-sufficiency."
PYT_slight_reforms:0 "The Volkssturm"
PYT_slight_reforms_desc:0 "The methods of the Bauernmiliz have been perfected through our advancements, and it has truly transformed. It is now a true army of the people. The Volkssturm stands ready to fight, and if necessary, die for their homes. Wahr di, Garr, de Buer de kumt!"
PYT_modern_guns:0 "Modern Rifles"
PYT_modern_guns_desc:0 "Due to the lack of the standardization of equipment amongst our forces, many of our soldiers are stuck with woefully out of date rifles. This is not currently a problem, but if we were ever to engage in combat with another nation, our soldiers would quickly be outmatched by their superior equipment. We must invest in designing and researching new rifles to solve this dilemma."
PYT_modern_artillery:0 "Artillery Implementation"
PYT_modern_artillery_desc:0 "Artillery remains a rare sight amongst our forces, with many units of the Bauernmiliz reluctant to adopt them due to a reliance on tradition and an aversion to change. But the prospect of artillery shattering our enemies before a grand attack by the infantry is too enticing to ignore. Artillery is the future, we only need to develop our own models before implementation can begin."
PYT_support_troops:0 "Support Squads"
PYT_support_troops_desc:0 "While most of the volunteers for the Bauernmiliz are excited to fight for their country on the frontlines, there is a distinct lack of support units amongst our forces. While not as exciting as the frontline roles, support roles are equally as vital to the war effort. We shall expand and develop these support units, thus creating a strong support structure for our army."
PYT_radio_implementation:0 "Radio Implementation"
PYT_radio_implementation_desc:0 "The prospective military uses of the radio are practically infinite. With better communication, we can overhaul and streamline our entire command structure. If we can develop our own radio models we can proceed with these ambitious plans."
PYT_motorization:0 "Motorisation"
PYT_motorization_desc:0 "Very few griffons in Greifenmarschen own, or would even recognize a car. But with the existing overhauls of our army in place, we can finally start to motorize our army. Motorized forces have the potential to outperform regular infantry in most aspects, to ignore such an advancement in technology would be folly of the highest order."
PYT_professionalism:0 "Strictly Professional"
PYT_professionalism_desc:0 "It is time for change at last. We are surrounded by nations fielding drilled armies of full-time soldiers. If we are to retain our independence and liberty, we must adapt and modernize our army."
PYT_implement_army_drills:0 "Standardized Equipment"
PYT_implement_army_drills_desc:0 "The Bauernmiliz has no real concept of a standardized piece of equipment, or doctrine for that matter. In the past our soldiers have simply used what was available at the time, and it has worked adequately for our needs in the past. But if we are to drag the Bauernmiliz kicking and screaming into modernity, we will have to establish some sort of standardization amongst our equipment."
PYT_armouries:0 "Proper Armouries"
PYT_armouries_desc:0 "The logistical system of the Bauernmiliz is a nightmare for all involved. Few griffons even know where the majority of the reserve arms are stored, with thousands of small villages having their own set of rifles hidden away in some compartment or another. This insanity must be stopped, we shall gather all of our arms and place them in properly secured and documented facilities."
PYT_instill_discipline:0 "A Sense of Discipline"
PYT_instill_discipline_desc:0 "If the Bauernmiliz is to face our enemies on the battlefield, they must be utterly unshakable from their duties. If the officers tell them to charge, they must charge. And if the officers tell them to retreat, they must retreat. Such a sense of discipline is currently lacking in our forces but through an intense training program, we can make sure that every single soldier will do his duty when the time comes."
PYT_an_actual_officer_core:0 "A New Officer Core"
PYT_an_actual_officer_core_desc:0 "While the current system of allowing soldiers to elect their officers makes for happy soldiers, it does not make good officers. We must fix this if we are ever to fight in a real war. Our current officers will be tested, those who prove themselves will stay, while those who do not will be demoted. After this, we will ensure that officers will be promoted by merit, thus solving this problem for good."
PYT_the_peoples_army:0 "The Volksarmee"
PYT_the_peoples_army_desc:0 "After an immense amount of reforms and changes, the Bauernmiliz has been transformed into a professional force. Our soldiers stand ready and able to fight with absolute discipline no matter the situation, and our officers now show an air of authority. The title of Bauernmiliz no longer fits our well trained army. Henceforth, it shall be known as the Volksarmee, a proper title for a proper army."
PYT_implement_conscription:0 "Implement Conscription"
PYT_implement_conscription_desc:0 "Conscription is a controversial topic within Griefenmarschen, as membership in the Bauernmiliz has traditionally been a purely voluntary endeavor. But the fact of the matter is that we are already outgunned and outmanned by our potential enemies. Whatever the public may feel about conscription, it is a necessary evil if we are to protect ourselves."
PYT_streamlined_training:0 "Streamlined Training"
PYT_streamlined_training_desc:0 "Currently, basic training in the Bauernmiliz is heavily based on what unit of the militia you join. Many units have unique methods of putting recruits through basic training, causing the average time it takes for a soldier to get ready for combat to vary wildly. To fix this problem, we shall study the methods of the most efficient units and implement them as standard practice across the entire Bauernmiliz."
PYT_auxiliary_roles:0 "Auxiliary Military Roles"
PYT_auxiliary_roles_desc:0 "While frontline fighters may be the most famous amongst our armed forces, they are not by any means the only ones. To truly create an effective fighting force, various support units are necessary to enable the soldiers to fight at their peak capacity. Logistics, maintenance and more are crucial to maintaining a highly effective fighting force, it would be wise to establish such support for the Bauernmiliz."

PYT_the_economy:0 "A New Economy For a New Age"
PYT_the_economy_desc:0 "The new millenium has dawned and with it economic revolution. Farmers abroad use new tools which require less labour, leaving those without work to move to cities. So far we have avoided such change, but our economy is becoming dangerously uncompetitive. Now that our faction has enough popular support, our proposals will likely be approved by the referendums. Therefore it is time to decide how to reform our economy."
PYT_agrarianism:0 "Stick to the Classics"
PYT_agrarianism_desc:0 "Ruralism and agrarianism are defining aspects of our country. Changing these would require changing what we are. We must remain true to ourselves and focus on reforming agriculture, which is the foundation of our existence."
PYT_connect_countryside:0 "Connect the Countryside"
PYT_connect_countryside_desc:0 "Unlike in cities, in rural areas everything is far apart. If we wish for our populace to have easy access to services such as schools, hospices, temples and markets, we must improve our dirt paths into proper paved roads."
PYT_support_local_business:0 "Support Local Businesses"
PYT_support_local_business_desc:0 "Instead of focusing on markets and companies in Oldwingburg, we should aid small businesses in our villages and towns who serve the locals and provide them what they need. This means griffons will be less inclined to move to cities and will instead remain on their farms."
PYT_foreign_experts:0 "Public Works Projects"
PYT_foreign_experts_desc:0 "To reduce unemployment and to increase the availability of services in rural areas, we will begin public works projects intended to build schools, hospitals, wells, sewers and bridges in the underdeveloped countryside. The funding will come entirely from the pockets of the government, instead those of urban entrepreneurs who only care about urban areas."
PYT_initial_modernisation_efforts:0 "Into the Modern Age"
PYT_initial_modernisation_efforts_desc:0 "Now that we have laid the foundations, we can begin to modernize our agrarian country, without necessarily urbanizing it. We will adopt new technologies from abroad, reform education and pass new laws, ultimately proving to the world that modernity does not require sacrificing tradition and identity!"
PYT_distribute_land:0 "Work the Land"
PYT_distribute_land_desc:0 "For decades now griffons have been abandoning farms and moving to towns and cities such as Oldwingburg in search of a living. It is time for this trend to be reversed! The countryside, now having proper infrastructure, shall be repopulated and abandoned land will be reclaimed."
PYT_subsidise_agrculture:0 "Subsidise the Farmers"
PYT_subsidise_agrculture_desc:0 "Instead of supporting the merchants and artisans in urban areas, the government should aid the farmers, especially after poor harvests. With this we will not only ensure further development of the countryside but also receive support from grateful farmers."
PYT_mechanise_agriculture:0 "Agricultural Mechanisation"
PYT_mechanise_agriculture_desc:0 "Our agricultural sector cannot compete with foreign noble estates because of our low and decentralized production. To deal with the issue, we should mechanize our agriculture which will greatly increase production and make the farmers' lives easier."
PYT_finished_reforms:0 "A Green Society"
PYT_finished_reforms_desc:0 "After a series of reforms proposed by our faction, Greifenmarschen has changed while remaining the same. Agriculture is still vital for our economy, society and culture, but it has been modernized and the lives of farmers have greatly improved. With Eyr's blessing, may the Peasants' Republic last forever!"
PYT_mining_techniques:0 "Modern Mining Tools"
PYT_mining_techniques_desc:0 "The earth is the source of most of our wealth. On its surface, we grow our crops, and beneath it we dig and find precious minerals. However, our miners produce little while risking their lives, mostly because of our outdated techniques and tools. We need to import foreign tools and invite foreign experts to revolutionize our mining operations."
PYT_thurwingen_mining:0 "Thurwingian Mines"
PYT_thurwingen_mining_desc:0 "A while ago farmers in Thurwingen claimed they struck rich veins of shining metal while tilling their soil. It is time for us to send the foreign experts we invited to prospect the region and evaluate the size of the deposits. If they are large enough, we will put our new tools to use!"
PYT_oil_wells:0 "Oil In Nortfome"
PYT_oil_wells_desc:0 "Shortly after mining operations in Thurwingen began, miners discovered pockets of crude oil underground. Our foreign experts have conducted seismic surveys and estimated that the oil deposits are part of a much larger reservoir which extends to Nortfome as well and is ultimately part of the massive Adelart petroleum reservoir. We should take advantage of this and fund the construction of oil wells!"
PYT_teach_the_people:0 "Begin the War Against Illiteracy"
PYT_teach_the_people_desc:0 "The stereotype of an uneducated, superstitious and illiterate peasant is unfortunately true for our citizens. If we wish to modernize our nation, we must teach the griffons to read, for it is the foundation for everything modern. Our literacy programs must begin as soon as possible."
PYT_industrialisation:0 "Industrialisation"
PYT_industrialisation_desc:0 "Beyond our borders farmers are abandoning the countryside and moving to urban cities to toil in factories. The workers have better access to services such as education and gain better wages. It is clear that to improve our own lives, we must embrace modernity which we fear so greatly."
PYT_buy_the_land:0 "Buy Out the Farmers"
PYT_buy_the_land_desc:0 "If we wish for our cities to expand, we must acquire the surrounding farmlands. The peasant families have held them for centuries, but all we need to do to persuade them to sell their lands is offer them enough bits."
PYT_oil:0 "Black Gold"
PYT_oil_desc:0 "As surveys were being completed on the land we had recently acquired, we discovered pockets of petroleum underground. This is great news for us, for with oil production industrialization will be much easier and our economy will strengthen. Oil wells must be constructed at once!"
PYT_dig_deeper:0 "Dig Deep and Dig Greedily"
PYT_dig_deeper_desc:0 "Several exploration wells we built have shown that the oil deposits are part of the vast Adelart reservoir, meaning that with slant drilling we can greatly increase our oil production. Griffons in Adelart surely won't mind if we claim our fair share of the treasure."
PYT_synthethic:0 "Synthethic Oil Experiments"
PYT_synthethic_desc:0 "While we have more than enough oil production now, it might be wise to invest in syntethic oil, considering how the oil wells will eventually run dry. It is a long-term investment that will hopefully pay off."
PYT_rapid_industrialisation:0 "The March of Progress"
PYT_rapid_industrialisation_desc:0 "We are far behind neighbouring nations such as Feathisia, Aquileia and the Empire, with our economy largely agrarian. Now that we have enough land, we can rent plots for a low price, construct new factories and subsidise our industrialists so our industry can massively expand. We must take expensive loans but it will ultimately be worthwhile."
PYT_railroad:0 "The Great Greifenmarschen Railroad"
PYT_railroad_desc:0 "Our transportation still relies mostly on dirt roads and the only railroad in our country is an old and dilapidated one, built years ago to connect Oldwingburg with Romau. That railroad must be renovated and expanded, its capacity and length greatly increased. Ultimately all railroads in Greifenmarschen shall lead to Oldwingburg, the growing industrial heart of our country."
PYT_arms_industry:0 "Domestic Arms Industry"
PYT_arms_industry_desc:0 "For years now our soldiers have used Imperial armouries and local gunsmiths to arm themselves. If we wish to modernize our army, we have to use standardized weaponry produced exclusively in our efficient factories. Instead of our militiagriffs buying any weapons they wish, our army will acquire exclusvely domestic equipment and give it to our soldiers."
PYT_industrialisation_finish:0 "An Industrial Nation"
PYT_industrialisation_finish_desc:0 "Our reforms are finally bearing fruit and the population of Oldwingburg and other towns is growing rapidly, with the countryside being abandoned. Businesses are booming, new factories open without any aid from us and the wages of factory workers have surpassed those of farmers. We are finally becoming an industrialized, modern nation. May our neighbours no longer mock us for our backwardness!"
PYT_tech_college:0 "The Oldwingburg Institute of Engineering"
PYT_tech_college_desc:0 "If we wish to industrialize our nation, we need experts who can design and create modern machines, and those experts should not be expensive ones hired from abroad. By founding a specialized instituion where engineers can study and work, our country will not lack educated minds which we sorely need."
PYT_societal_advancement:0 "Here and Now"
PYT_societal_advancement_desc:0 "We must take decisive action to modernize our nation. Education will be reformed and made available for free for the masses, and new economic laws should be passed to liberalize our protectionist economy."
PYT_modern_methods:0 "Modern Industrial Methods"
PYT_modern_methods_desc:0 "Now that we have many talented engineers working for us, we can begin a program to implement more efficient production methods. Assembly lines, numerous machines and electric factory lighting shall all herald the beginning of a new age in Greifenmarschen."
PYT_research_slot:0 "State Funded Universities"
PYT_research_slot_desc:0 "Any young griffons in our country who wish to attain a higher education have no option but to move across the river to Yale. Oftentimes they graduate there and move to other countries to work. We must found our own universities and generously fund them so we have enough talented teachers for all the eager students who can now stay in their beloved homeland."

PYT_navy_stuff:0 "Founding a Navy"
PYT_navy_stuff_desc:0 "For the first time in our nation's history we have claimed coastline, the vast and terrifying ocean finally within our sight. Many threats lurk beyond the horizon, and we must prepare for their arrival and build ships of war. The locals will be able to aid us in this effort."
PYT_base_strike_f:0 "Strike at the Heart"
PYT_base_strike_f_desc:0 "The core of our enemies will not always be vulnerable to a direct attack. Often a nations true naval strength lies not directly in its Navy, but in the ports and dockyards which supply and repair it. But through the use of carriers and submarines, we can deliver crippling blows to this critical portion of our foes industry, while protecting our own."
PYT_carrier_f:0 "Carrier Experiments"
PYT_carrier_f_desc:0 "Carriers have the potential to completely revolutionize naval warfare. Through the combined might of the navy and the airforce, almost limitless tactical and strategic possibilities present themselves. But before any of that can be done, we need to actually develop a solid carrier model."
PYT_navy_planes_f:0 "Naval Aviation"
PYT_navy_planes_f_desc:0 "To deal with the unique challenges that come with carrier-based operations, new models and designs of planes must be developed. With each improvement to our carrier-based planes the strategic potential of our carriers increased, we would truly be mad to ignore this avenue of advancement."
PYT_fleet_being_f:0 "A Show of Force"
PYT_fleet_being_f_desc:0 "Our ports are the most critical part of our naval strength, as without them our navy would not last long unsupplied. By constructing a fleet focused on large battleships we can simply intimidate the enemy fleets, forcing them to stay away from our home waters while we build up the navy. And a few battleships certainly wouldn't hurt the national pride either."
PYT_dockyards:0 "A Home Port"
PYT_dockyards_desc:0 "To fuel our newly established naval efforts, a true home port is required. By constructing several new dockyards we can meet the demand for our navy, and provide a new destination for trade to arrive in our nation."
PYT_battlecruiser_f:0 "Bigger Ships"
PYT_battlecruiser_f_desc:0 "In order to stay competitive with the navies of other nations, we must constantly develop and expand our hulls. Bigger is better as they say, and we can certainly go bigger than our current models."
PYT_light_cruiser_f:0 "Light Cruisers"
PYT_light_cruiser_f_desc:0 "In order to meet the ever more stringent demands of our navy, our light cruiser models must be improved. The armor and armaments of our current models can almost certainly be improved, and if we have to break a few naval treaties to accomplish this, so be it."
PYT_battleship_f:0 "Battleships"
PYT_battleship_f_desc:0 "The pride of every nation, building and designing a proper battleship is a truly daunting task. But with the ever-expanding naval capacity of our nation combined with the latest advancements in naval technology have now made this feasible. The time has come to construct a true flagship for our navy."
PYT_expand_dockyards:0 "Dockyard Expansion"
PYT_expand_dockyards_desc:0 "Our ever-expanding navy now devours resources and manpower at a steady rate, and to meet this massive new demand multiple new dockyards will be constructed. A navy cannot exist without dockyards after all."
PYT_marine_f:0 "Create a Marine Core"
PYT_marine_f_desc:0 "The nature of modern war has rendered amphibious operations a necessity. Rather than throwing our normal forces at the beaches untrained and unready for their task, we shall create a new arm of the Navy specifically to deal with these landings, creating soldiers who can truly thrive in an amphibious environment."
PYT_transport_f:0 "Modern Transport Vessels"
PYT_transport_f_desc:0 "As our amphibious operations expand, the demand for new and better-equipped transport vessels does as well. By improving our existing designs we can deliver more soldiers to the battlefield faster and more efficiently than before."
PYT_trade_indirection_f:0 "Striking at the Lifelines"
PYT_trade_indirection_f_desc:0 "Against a truly overwhelming opponent, we cannot risk a direct confrontation. But the latest advancements in submarine technology provide another option. By constructing a large fleet of submarines and through developing new tactics based around these submarines we can simply cut off all trade to our enemies. A massive navy is of little use when there is no oil to fuel it after all."
PYT_destroyer_f:0 "Patrol Boats"
PYT_destroyer_f_desc:0 "Not every task requires the biggest guns in the navy. Patroling the coastline and supporting the larger ships are roles that are much better filled with smaller ships. By leveraging their small size and ease of production our destroyers might be able to punch above their weight class."
PYT_submarine_f:0 "U-Boat Experiments"
PYT_submarine_f_desc:0 "The potential to strike our enemies ships unseen, hunting their fleets across the oceans and waiting for the perfect moment to strike, is truly tantalizing. By conditioning new designs of submarines, we can better realize this potential."

PYT_air_stuff:0 "Flying High"
PYT_air_stuff_desc:0 "Griffons were born to fly, to pierce the sky and enjoy true freedom. But despite the abilities granted by our wings, the limitations of biology have always prevented us from soaring too fast or too high. But with the latest innovations in airframes, we can shatter those limits, and griffonkind will know fewer limits in the sky than ever before."
PYT_fighter_projects:0 "Wings of Steel"
PYT_fighter_projects_desc:0 "Our current airframes are laughably outdated, and our first step in achieving dominance of the sky once more should be to update our fighter models. We have little to be concerned about from enemy planes if our fighters simply rip them to shreds after all."
PYT_doctrinal_development:0 "High Altitude Training"
PYT_doctrinal_development_desc:0 "Despite being more naturally suited to the skies than most species, excessive altitudes can still heavily hamper a griffon pilots capabilities in the field. By training our pilots at these extreme altitudes we can gradually wean them to the massive heights that they will have to endure as professional pilots, granting us a tactical advantage over our enemies."
PYT_actual_air_bases:0 "The Asselt Airfields"
PYT_actual_air_bases_desc:0 "While airplanes were never particularly popular in Greifenmarschen, there was the odd griffon known to own a plane back in the day. A defunct aerodrome now sits in Asselt, and its location makes it perfect to establish a new airfield upon. Our planes are little more than steel deathtraps with no place to land after all."
PYT_strat:0 "Strategic Bomber Effort"
PYT_strat_desc:0 "By striking our enemies critical wartime industries, we can potentially rob them of their abilities to supply their troops in the field with equipment. As the most critical industries are often the most well-guarded ones, a specialized type of bomber will have to be developed to carry and drop the bombs on our enemies industrial centers."
PYT_tact:0 "Tactical Bomber Effort"
PYT_tact_desc:0 "Why fire guns at our enemies from the ground when we can simply blow them up from the sky? By developing new tactical bombers to destroy enemy forces we can significantly damage our enemies divisions before they have a chance to engage with our ground troops."
PYT_napalm:0 "Napalm"
PYT_napalm_desc:0 "Napalm has proven itself to be a particularly useful tool during wartime. Burning at the same temperature as gasoline and for far longer intervals, as well as sticking tenaciously to its targets. This substance is almost perfect for its usage in payloads for our bombers, serving as a perfect weapon to use against structures and infantry."
PYT_CAS_projects:0 "Claws of Iron"
PYT_CAS_projects_desc:0 "Though they may lack the heavier payloads of our tactical bombers, our close air support frames still serve a vital role in our combat operations. By attacking and destroying smaller targets of opportunity during battle, close are support can easily turn the tide of battles if used properly."
PYT_heavy_fighter_projects:0 "Guarding Our Skies"
PYT_heavy_fighter_projects_desc:0 "In order to provide an effective escort for our strategic bombers, a new design of fighter must be developed. Sporting heavier armaments, and being all around heavier and less agile, than a regular fighter, these planes can comfortably escort our bombers. And will provide a  tough foe to all enemy interceptors seeking to destroy our bombers."
PYT_rocket_projects:0 "Rocketry Projects"
PYT_rocket_projects_desc:0 "While many consider them a novelty of warfare, rockets hold immense potential both as a means of propelling our aircraft and as a weapon in and of themselves. Investing in testing sites and new rocket designs is only prudent at this point."
PYT_paratrooper_project:0 "The Screaming Eagles"
PYT_paratrooper_project_desc:0 "Jumping from altitudes that even the bravest griffons would have considered insane only a few years ago, our elite paratroopers can handily land behind enemy lines to cause havoc. And as their equipment gets more sophisticated, their potential strategic and tactical uses increase as well."
PYT_expanded_bases:0 "Expand the Asselt Air Fields"
PYT_expanded_bases_desc:0 "To meet the demands of our expanding airforce, and to provide the nessicary capacity for further expansion, the already sizable airfields at Asselt must be expanded once more."
PYT_jet_fighters:0 "The V-1 Jet Fighter"
PYT_jet_fighters_desc:0 "After multiple prototypes and false-starts, the first ever viable model for a jet-powered fighter produced by our designers approaches. With even more investment we can enter into a new age of aviation, flying planes at speeds that would make the common griffon speechless."

PYT_the_national_republic:0 "The National Republic"
PYT_the_national_republic_desc:0 "Dietrich Mach and his deputy Wilke Truthahn, figureheads of the fascist NAP faction, have successfully seized power in Greifenmarschen. The Council has been disbanded after its members were forced to swear loyalty to the new rulers of the country. Now Dietrich and Wilke can finally pass reforms they've desired for so long."
PYT_mobilise_the_people:0 "Mobilise the People"
PYT_mobilise_the_people_desc:0 "Every griffon in Greifenmarschen is a citizen and every citizen is a soldier. Yet only few are in active duty as participation in the Bauernmiliz is mostly voluntary. This must change at once! Our proud peasants must take up arms and prepare to fight filthy aristocrat pigs lurking beyond the border!"
PYT_the_partys_army:0 "Officialise the Bohngarde"
PYT_the_partys_army_desc:0 "The Bohngarde, the unofficial paramilitary wing of NAP named after Edwin Bohn, the founder of the faction, has served us well for many years. It is time we reward them for their loyalty by turning them into the official state police of Greifenmarschen, responsible for ensuring internal security and guarding the lives of NAP members."
PYT_loyalty_officers:0 "Bohngarde Loyalty Officers"
PYT_loyalty_officers_desc:0 "To ensure our militiagriffs remain absolutely loyal to their beloved fatherland, we will integrate the Bohngarde with the Bauernmiliz. Officers will ensure national fervour in the ranks and punish those who wish to betray us all."
PYT_hey_slovaci:0 "Loyalität zum Vaterland!"
PYT_hey_slovaci_desc:0 "Dietrich Mach has commissioned a talented musician from Nortfome to write an official anthem for Greifenmarschen, which so far has lacked one. The song will be called 'Loyalität zum Vaterland!', its lyrics will be written in Herzlandish and it will be imbued with nationalist and militarist themes, saying how Greifenmarschen will always stand firm and proud above the despots of the world."
PYT_reinforce_power:0 "Consolidate Our Grip"
PYT_reinforce_power_desc:0 "If we are to strike at the heart of the Empire and liberate Herzland, we must be united and strong. Those who wish to weaken and divide us from within will be taken care of and our corrupt democratic institutions will be reformed. Hesitation in Greifenmarschen will die and be replaced by glorious determination!"
PYT_control_knowledge:0 "Control Knowledge"
PYT_control_knowledge_desc:0 "To guard our country from within, we must seize the printing presses and nationalize them. Nothing shall be printed without explicit permission and approval from NAP. Book burnings shall also be organized across the country as we must cleanse Greifenmarschen from corrupt, degenerate and weak ideas spread by foreign aristocrats."
PYT_control_the_people:0 "Totalitarian Democracy"
PYT_control_the_people_desc:0 "For almost two centuries have the people held power in Greifenmarschen. As such, they are resistant to the idea of NAP leaders remaining in control and deciding everything. Internal dissent must not divide us ever again, but perhaps we can let them vote after all. The results of referendums will require approval from Dietrich and voting will be closely monitored by the Bohngarde."
PYT_remove_truthahn:0 "Dispose of Truthahn"
PYT_remove_truthahn_desc:0 "Deputy Wilke Truthahn has long seen Dietrich as an upstart rival, and now that NAP is in power the cooperation between the two has completely collapsed, with daily arguments and constant disagreements. The old loonie is now nothing more but a thorn on our side. Dietrich's patience has ran out and he now plans to ask Wilke to resign. With most of NAP loyal to him, it would be unwise for Wilke to say no."
PYT_staff_the_council:0 "Staff the Council"
PYT_staff_the_council_desc:0 "The Council was an integral institution of Greifenmarschen that had been disbanded during the coup. Now Dietrich is finally prepared to reinstate it like he had promised, but with many changes. Mostly that it would be little more than a puppet government filled with NAP loyalists, its members saying yes to anything Dietrich proposes."
PYT_control_the_government:0 "Outlaw 'Disloyal' Factions"
PYT_control_the_government_desc:0 "GKVP, KPG and GVHP are nothing more than bands of traitors and pacifist cowards. Their leaders have already sworn undying loyalty to NAP, but can they be trusted? And the regular members have sworn no oaths at all. It is clear these illegal gangs should be disbanded and their leaders arrested, for they are nothing more than tumours."
PYT_mobilise_the_economy:0 "Mobilise the Economy"
PYT_mobilise_the_economy_desc:0 "Preparations must begin for the grand unification campaigns. The underdeveloped economy of Greifenmarschen needs to be able to support a massive war effort! We must greatly increase our military expenditure, draft workers and confiscate resources needed by our army."
PYT_corporate_economy:0 "Implement Corporatism"
PYT_corporate_economy_desc:0 "The economy won't become strong on its own. The guiding claw of state-owned corporations, all managing different sectors, will ensure planned and quick growth. In addition corporatism can be used to reduce opposition to our rule and reward those loyal to us."
PYT_industry_grows:0 "Industrial Grants"
PYT_industry_grows_desc:0 "Money will be printed en masse, then used to fund the construction of new factories and to support our corporations. Debts will be taken care of once we loot the countless noble manors in Herzland."
PYT_agricultural_support:0 "Blood and Soil"
PYT_agricultural_support_desc:0 "While industrialization is necessary for the liberation war, we cannot forget the peasants of the countryside who are true Greifenmarsians and the foundation of our nation. Rural values are bound to our blood! We should grant farmland to the unemployed urban workers and generously aid farmers with a state-owned fund, the Bauernfond."
PYT_the_road_to_herzland:0 "In die Bresche!"
PYT_the_road_to_herzland_desc:0 "For too long has Herzland been divided between fat aristocrat pigs and weakened by tyranny. It was time at last to liberate all Herzlanders and unite them under one banner! The noble scum and the unreliable Archons would all receive their punishments for oppressing the people for generations. Onwards, brave Greifenmarsians! To death and glorious victory!"

PYT_red_army:0 "The Greifenmarschen Red Army"
PYT_red_army_desc:0 "The dark threat of the evil Empire looms threateningly over us all. We must prepare our griffons to fight for their freedom, to the death if need be!

PYT_red_commandos:0 "Revolutionäre Expeditionsabteilung"
PYT_red_commandos_desc:0 "We cannot deny that we are few in number, while our enemies are numerous. Without quantity, we must focus on quality. A special expeditionary division will be formed, consisting of the most skilled and loyal soldiers of KPG. Our finest officers shall lead them to victory!"
PYT_loyal_officers:0 "Fresh Blood"
PYT_loyal_officers_desc:0 "The fascists, capitalists and aristocrats beyond our borders outnumber us greatly! Our revolution cannot be crushed before it has even properly begun. Participation in the Bauernmiliz has long been voluntary, but the dire situation demands that this changes. The old Council would've never approved this, but we must implement forced conscription. Otherwise we will be slain and enslaved."
PYT_mass_mobilisation:0 "Mobilise the Workers"
PYT_mass_mobilisation_desc:0 "We still do not have enough soldiers! More is needed to fight the oppressors abroad. We have no choice but to conscript the workers, whose loyalty to our revolution cannot be doubted. They will fight fanatically to protect their livelihood and their families! Unfortunately the workshops, factories and farms will be emptier than before, but this is a temporary measure."
PYT_the_road_to_communism:0 "The First KPG Party Congress"
PYT_the_road_to_communism_desc:0 "It is time for Greifenmarschen to become a true communist state, modeled after Stalliongrad and the writings of comrade Caramel Marks.

### Events ###
marschen.1.t:0 "The Matter of the Economy"
marschen.1.d:0 "The Council met in the Temple of Boreas in Oldwingburg to discuss the possibility of extensive economic reforms. Members of different factions supported different proposals: KPG and NAP generally advocated rapid industrialisation and modernisation to drag the country to the new millenium, while GKVP and GVHP preferred more conservative agrarian reforms aimed at modernizing the countryside and focusing on agricultural production.\n\nThe debate lasted late into the night, until finally the Council agreed on what direction Greifenmarschen's economy should take. It remained to be seen if the peasants would approve any proposals made."
marschen.1.a:0 "No point in fixing what's already perfect"
marschen.1.b:0 "Industrialisation is the way forward!"

marschen.2.t:0 "Derailing the Argument"
marschen.2.d:0 "Today grave news arrived in Oldwingburg about a terrible accident near Landstal. A passenger train derailed on the old railroad from Romau to Oldwingburg, built with Imperial funding decades ago. Dozens of griffons have died and almost a hundred injured. Erebus Whiteplume proposed this day to be a day of national mourning, and the Council unianimously agreed and drafted a proper proposal which was then approved by the populace in a referendum two weeks later. The day of mourning was finally held three weeks after the accident.\n\nProponents of industrialization and modernization now say the accident was the fault of the agrarian program which moved funds away from renovating vital railways and used them to build roads in the sparsely populated countryside. They say this disaster would've been avoided if the government had instead focused on maintaining the vital railroads between urban areas."
marschen.2.a:0 "How was I supposed to know the rails were broken?!"

marschen.3.t:0 "Local Businesses on the Rise"
marschen.3.d:0 "Our decision to support small, local businesses in the countryside with subsidies and protectionist legislation is beginning to pay off. Not only are old companies staying afloat, but new ones are being founded every week, with some Oldwingburgers even moving to the countryside to start businesses of their own.\n\n[From.GetLeader], who had supported these reforms from the beginning, used the opportunity to convince othes of the effectiveness of their agrarian policy, gathering more political support for their cause."
marschen.3.a:0 "The economy is booming!"

marschen.4.t:0 "Öffentliche Bauarbeiten Bears Fruit"
marschen.4.d:0 "Our public works projects are proving to be successful. Not only has unemployment sharply decreased, but peasants in rural areas now have access to goods and services which before were exclusive for urbanites. As such, many griffons in the countryside will likely vote for us in the next elections."
marschen.4.a:0 "That's great to hear!"

marschen.5.t:0 "Farmers Show Support For the Government"
marschen.5.d:0 "The peasants, as predicted, are grateful for our subsidies and aid. They are so grateful, in fact, that a pro-government march has been organized in Oldwingburg. The streets filled with cattle and wagons as the farmers praised us and told everyone to vote for us in the next elections."
marschen.5.a:0 "Wonderful!"

marschen.6.t:0 "Tractor Panic"
marschen.6.d:0 "In recent weeks the first imported tractors have been acquired by farmers and put to use. However, not everyone is eager about this new innovation arriving in Greifenmarschen. In Nortfome, a group of frightened peasants attacked a tractor which was approaching their farm, destroying it and badly injuring its driver who was the owner of a neighbouring farm. The peasants claimed innocence in the following trial, saying that they were simply defending their home from a fearsome dragon. Other peasants have claimed tractors are demons sent by Maar, enraged Slingtails or hungry Cragadiles."
marschen.6.a:0 "Calm yourselves, they're just tractors! They won't eat your souls."

marschen.7.t:0 "Mining Incident"
marschen.7.d:0 "Worrying news come from Thurwingen: Over a hundred miners are stuck after a portion of a mining tunnel collapsed behind them, trapping them underground. Despite the best efforts of the miners outside, they cannot break through the cave-in and it is likely all the trapped griffons have suffocated or died of hunger by now. Because it was our initiative to begin mining operations as quickly as possible without much care for safety, we are receiving the blame."
marschen.7.a:0 "Damn it all!"

marschen.8.t:0 "Illiteracy Rates Drop"
marschen.8.d:0 "Our recently started effort to increase the dreadfully low literacy rate is starting to yield results. Priests in local temples are very active in teaching both young and old to read holy texts, and new schools are being founded across the nation where our griffons can learn without paying too much. Much work remains to be done, but already many peasants are finally becoming literate."
marschen.8.a:0 "Good."

marschen.9.t:0 "Illiteracy Rates Continue Dropping"
marschen.9.d:0 "In a recent survey many griffons proved that they were now able to read relatively fluently. Book stores and printing presses are also reporting that their number of customers has grown greatly in recent months. However, the poorest and busiest griffons who are unable to afford even basic education either because of a lack of funds or time remain illiterate. Several council members have proposed making basic education cost nothing, and the proposal will likely pass."
marschen.9.a:0 "Let us hope this trend continues."

marschen.10.t:0 "Illiteracy At An All Time Low"
marschen.10.d:0 "Another survey has been conducted and we can proudly say our country is more literate than ever. Books are now appearing in every household both urban and rural and newspapers are more popular than ever. With increased literacy more experts graduate and enter the workforce every month, boosting our economy."
marschen.10.a:0 "We're almost there!"

marschen.11.t:0 "Illiteracy Eradicated"
marschen.11.d:0 "The literacy rate of our populace has now officially reached 95%! Even the poor can now read basic texts without difficulty. Foreign nobles will be baffled when they witness our fluent and educated peasants reading as skillfully as them!"
marschen.11.a:0 "Magnificent!"

marschen.12.t:0 "The Adelart Oil Scandal"
marschen.12.d:0 "Our undercover slant drilling operations tapping across the border into Adelart's reservoirs were leaked recently. Some of our supporters were appalled by our underclawed act, while others were happy and said Adelart wasn't taking advantage of the oil anyways and that we did nothing wrong. Ultimately, the popularity of our faction dropped only a little."
marschen.12.a:0 "It could've been worse."

marschen.13.t:0 "The March of Progress"
marschen.13.d:0 "While many peasants have abandoned their farms and moved to cities to work in newly built factories, a loud minority are outraged by the recent industrialization program which they have been unable to stop. Farmers organized a large protest in Oldwingburg which even threatened to burst into a riot. They claimed the proponents of industrialisation are favouring the urban areas too much and turning Greifenmarschen into a completely different nation. Clearly, the peasants are fools who want to remain stuck in the last millenium so they can languish in poverty and ignorance. Greifenmarschen must be dragged into modernity, no matter how much it screams and wails, and majority of the populace agrees."
marschen.13.a:0 "We're merely doing what is necessary."

marschen.14.t:0 "Electing a Statthalter"
marschen.14.d:0 "Once again it is time to hold elections, elect new judges and reshuffle the Council, which gathers in the Temple of Boreas in Oldwingburg to draft new proposals for laws and political decisions which will then be approved or denied by plebicites. As always, the peasants were eager to vote and gathered in large crowds across the country to choose their local leaders. In addition each village sent a representative to Oldwingburg to elect the Statthalter, the symbolic leader of the nation who, despite lacking actual power, still commanded great respect.\n\n Out of the many candidates for the position of Statthalter, only four were likely to win the elections: old and ever-popular Erebus Whiteplume, nationalist and Herzlander supremacist Dietrich Mach, Equestrian immigrant Archibald Dawnclaw and communist reformist Wingbert Rohmer. Ultimately the griffon with the most votes was..."

The regent in question is Archon Eros VII, a religious cleric who used populist rhetoric to gain the support of the common griffons and has in return granted them limited rights. However, Eros and his two companions Erion XII and Proteus III have only amassed more power to themselves and have shown no interest in creating any kind of democratic governing body.\n\nMost worryingly, the Archons have not made any statements regarding our independence and freedom. It is entirely possible they intend for it to end.\n\nA hectic emergency meeting of the council was held soon after the news arrived. The arguments lasted for hours, with council members getting exhausted in the end. Ultimately, it was for naught as no agreement was made on what should be done about the situation, leaving all factions frustrated. After several more days the Council finally decided that it might be wise to deny the legitimacy of the Archons' regency and hold a referendum about independence. Nothing else.\n\nErebus, Dietrich, Archibald and Wingbert all left the Temple of Boreas without saying a single word, newfound determination in their eyes. They all seemed to have realized that the democracy of Greifenmarschen is completely unable to cope with the crisis. How they plan to resolve this issue is anybody's guess."

The regent in question is Duchess Gabriela Eagleclaw, the aristocratic ruler of Strawberry who aims to keep the nobility in power while opposing the populist Archons. However, as a traditionalist she might allow us to keep our independence and liberty if we remain loyal to her and the Emperor.\n\nShe might not.\n\nAn emergency meeting of the council was held soon after the news arrived.

Ultimately, it was for naught as no agreement was made on what should be done about the situation, leaving all factions frustrated. After several more days the council finally decided that it might be wise to recognize the legitimacy of the Duchess' regency and hold a referendum about remaining loyal to her and her aristocratic allies.\n\nHalf the Council was outraged by the decision and said the Archon would've been a better regent, for he was a champion of the common griffons unlike Gabriela, who still had made no guarantee to let Greifenmarschen remain independent. Erebus, Dietrich, Archibald and Wingbert, tired of the squabbling, marched out of the Temple of Boreas without saying a single word, newfound determination in their eyes.

marschen.17.d:0 "Within months the popularity of Archibald Dawnclaw's young harmonist faction has skyrocketed, for it has promised to not only to maintain liberty but also peace, which the citizen-soldiers of Greifenmarschen appreciate as they can continue living their calm rural lives. Now that the regency crisis has proven too difficult for the deeply divided Council to oversome, Archibald Dawnclaw and the rest of GVHP have decided to intervene, trusting that majority of the common griffons will stand behind them.\n\nArchibald and other faction members arrived in front of the Temple of Boreas early in the morning and blocked the entrance by sitting in front of it, peacefully protesting the Council's lack of consensus. Other council members who came later were outraged, saying the harmonists were obstructing the democratic process. Archibald retorted that the Council had already been doing that because of their inner division and said they needed to settle their differences, speaking of the ancient Equestrian legend about Windigoes and how the leaders of the three tribes almost froze to death while arguing, only saved by their advisors finding common ground and befriending each other. He said the Temple would remain blocked until they did the same and apologized to their voters who they had completely failed with their lack of harmony and friendship.\n\nWhat followed was a violent fight as insulted and furious NAP, GKVP and KPG members attacked the harmonists and tried to force their way in. Nearby citizens were shocked and intervened, as did the Bauernmiliz soon after. Three griffons lied dead and dozens of griffons were arrested. Dietrich, Wingbert and Erebus were all put to prison to await trial while GVHP members licked their wounds and assumed control of the country. Archibald promised democracy would soon be reinstated after several necessary reforms had been made. He did not say anything about holding referendums to approve those reforms, but most of the populace trusted Archibald and his faction."

marschen.18.t:0 "Rohmer's Communist Coup"
marschen.18.d:0 "As the economy of Greifenmarschen grows, so does inequality. In recent months this has resulted in constantly growing support for KPG, whose communist leader Wingbert Rohmer has promised to improve the lives of the unfortunate and downtrodden, dreaming to make Greifenmarschen a truly equal nation. In his eyes it is already proto-communist, and could become truly communist with only a few reforms. Reforms which he has been unable to propose because of opposition from other factions.\n\nWingbert knew that majority of the workers supported him now. It was time for change at last as the citizenry's faith in the Council was dropping. Now or never, he reasoned, and managed to persuade the rest of KPG to begin preparations for a revolution.\n\nThe morning sky shone bright red in the early morning as communist sympathisers, all armed, seized every public building and factory in Oldwingburg and arrested militiagriffs who did not wear signature red armbands, which showed allegiance to KPG. The coup was almost flawless, with only several gunfights breaking out resulting in a mere clawful of dead griffons.\n\nMembers of other factions in the Council gathered in front of the occupied Temple of Boreas, whose statue of the god had been defaced and which now had a red flag on its roof. Wingbert and his militia were there waiting for them. Before the enraged Council members could even ask what was happening, Wingbert held a speech condemning their actions and calling them traitors to the people. This made some members furious, especially the NAP deputy Wilke Truthahn who pulled out a gun from his pocket and aimed at Wingbert's head. Unfortunately Wingbert was faster and shot him in the leg, cripping him as communist militiagriffs seized him and arrested the other Council members. When Archibald, breaking down in tears, asked why they were being arrested, Wingbert calmly said he had already told them: They were guilty of betraying the common griffons of their nation who had voted for them in the first place.\n\nWhen concerned citizens asked KPG about the next elections, Wingbert bluntly said they would not be held and instead the country would be ruled by numerous workers' councils. Plebicites were now a thing of the past."

marschen.19.d:0 "Economic and social instability has plagued Herzland for decades now, and while Greifenmarschen has been relatively unaffected, griffons elsewhere languish in poverty and misery. Rising star Dietrich Mach has been holding passionate speeches about the liberation of their fellow Herzlanders and the spreading of Greifenmarsian liberty beyond their borders. Meanwhile the veteran NAP deputy Wilke Truthahn has for decades now blamed the Archons for all the suffering in the Empire, claiming it was their plot to destroy it in the first place. His anti-clerical sect, the Old Believers, is expanding rapidly, especially now that the Archons have become involved in the regency dispute. Both have been advocating aggression, which all three other factions are hesitant about.\n\nIt was clear to both Dietrich and Wilke that simply holding fiery speeches wouldn't do anything. Now that the freedom of Greifenmarschen was threatened and Archons plotted in the shadows, it was time to strike immediately! They could no longer suffer the Council to stand in their way and doom their beloved homeland. The paramilitarist wing of NAP, the infamous Bohngarde, rallied behind them as they prepared to break the political deadlock with force if necessary.\n\nThe Council held a meeting as usual, but curiously not a single member of the NAP faction was present. An hour of political debate later they heard the echoes of a marching group outside. Soon the doors of the Temple were flung open and heavily armed militiagriffs burst inside, led by Dietrich and Wilke. They tried to speak but the Council was loudly panicking and protesting, so Wilke took out his gun and shot into the ceiling to silence them, then shouted that the national revolution had broken out and that no one was allowed to leave. Dietrich said in a more calm tone that the Council had been disbanded and the NAP would form the new government of Greifenmarschen. At gunpoint, Wilke demanded the former members of the council, now regular griffons, to swear eternal allegiance to NAP in the name of Boreas. Wingbert Rohmer spat on his face, smacked the pistol out of his grasp and tried to fly out of the building, but was stopped when a militiagriff shot him in the wing and grounded him. Whimpering and barely alive from the impact, he swore allegiance to NAP along with the rest of the council.\n\nDietrich held a speech in the center of Oldwingburg on the following day, promising to reinstate democracy once Greifenmarschen's independence was secured. Wilke added it would not be reinstated until the Archons were hanged."

marschen.20.d:0 "Erebus Whiteplume is a true veteran in the political scene of Greifenmarschen, having been active for over 40 years and holding the position of Statthalter countless times. Yet this experience only means he knows all the faults of the democracy of Greifenmarschen, especially after his travels abroad to countries such as Equestria and Sicameon. He can't help but admit that even despotic countries such as Brodfeld are run more efficiently than the political quagmire of Greifenmarschen, where constant referendums and elections are the norm. He still loves his country and its institutions like a father would love a disabled child, but his wishes to extensively reform the nation have so far been denied by the three other factions.\n\nNow, in perhaps the most dire time in his country's long history, changes are more necessary than ever yet remain undone. The harmonists, fascists and communists all squabble in the Temple of Boreas, unable to even fully agree whether to support the Imperial regent or not, let alone decide how to prepare for a possible invasion or maintain a healthy economy if relations turn sour with the Empire. His old age has perhaps made him cranky, but nevertheless the GKVP, a faction that wouldn't even exist without him, supported him wholeheartedly when he proposed something radical:\n\nA coup.\n\nThe Council held a meeting as usual, with most members attending. Once again the arguments went nowhere as the factions failed to agree on anything, with the fascists and communists on each others' throats. It was then that Erebus gave the signal to his fellow GKVP members, and stood up. He began to speak and the building went silent at once, for everyone respected the old and wise griffon. In his speech, he told about how wonderful Greifenmarschen was, a unique nation in the world where the common griffons were truly free, where the will of the people had the ultimate power. Then he sighed deeply and spoke of the flaws in the system, how completely impossible it was to pass reforms desired by all four factions, how laughable the Council's response to the regency issue had been. He said change was needed, and it was needed now, and asked if the other members of the council could trust him and GKVP to do what they must. Many were hesitant, especially the leaders of the factions who all had their own plans of seizing power, but all agreed that Erebus was indeed right about the state of the country and GKVP, as agreed, enthusiastically showed support.\n\nErebus continued instead of waiting for replies from the other factions, saying how once again this showed how they couldn't make any decisions, and that he had no option but to temporarily suspend the Council, stop referendums and seize power. This made some griffons furious, but Erebus calmed them by saying they needed to trust him if they wanted Greifenmarschen to survive. And ultimately, if they wanted to resist him, they should remember that the citizens stood behind him and supported him. They wouldn't want to betray their own people, would they?\n\nAnd so dozens of Council members marched outside quietly and in good order, leaving Erebus and GKVP in charge of the country, for now."

It reported news around the globe like a normal newspaper, but also focused on events related to NAP such as meetings, speeches and rallies, always presenting them as rousing successes. The tone of the news was far, far away from objectivity and neutrality, with the text often digressing and ranting about the evil plots of nobles abroad, the suffering of fellow Herzlander peasants who live in slavery, the glorious past victories of Greifenmarsian peasants against "arrogant gentry scum" and the importance of the unification of Herzland under a "pure and free" Greifenmarsian regime."

Dietrich then continued, speaking of Greifenmarsian traditions and the wonder of its institutions, and how the griffons should rejoice that they are the most free people in the world. For the third time the crowd cheered.\n\nDietrich did not say that elections for Council members would not be held and that they would be instead appointed by him, and that he'd only choose NAP members who were utterly loyal to him."

When he considered to have enough popular support, he made his move.\n\nWilke woke up at his home to do his usual daily routines, which included checking the mailbox. What he found was a mysterious, unmarked letter. He opened it out of curiosity, only to discover to his horror that it was a mail bomb. In his mind he already prayed to Boreas, but the bomb did not explode. He sighed, both relieved and confused, and read what the actual letter said.\n\nIt was a warning. The bomb was intentionally made unable to explode. The message simply said that it would be wise for Wilke to resign as soon as possible and retire from politics, or he wouldn't be able to enjoy his retirement. Mostly because he'd be missing limbs."

Dietrich, however, remained mostly unconcerned, confident that he had gathered enough support from NAP members.\n\nHe was wrong.\n\nAs the two leaders had argued and Dietrich had secretly been building up support, Wilke had been doing the same. The Old Believers were especially loyal to him and him alone, deeply hating Dietrich and his misguided decisions. As the Bohngarde searched for Wilke in vain, traitors among their ranks misguided them and ensured he would not be found. Soon enough the Temple of Boreas was barely protected, with most Bohngarde members engaged in extensive searches. That was when Wilke and his supporters struck.\n\nAs Dietrich was holding a speech to his fellow party members, sounds of explosions came from outside, followed by gunshots. The few guards were trying to defend the Temple from attackers coming from all sides and retreated inside, some of them wounded. Dietrich quickly realized what was happening and took out his pistol and urged the other NAP members to do the same.\n\nThe fight for the control of Greifenmarschen had begun."

Truthahn held a fiery speech, condemning Dietrich and calling him an Archonite collaborator who planned to let Imperial armies occupy the country and annex it without a fight. He and his misguided followers had all been dealt with in the past week, and the sight in front of the Temple reminded everyone how Wilke dealt with traitors. He promised that a new age would begin in Greifenmarschen, with the faith of the Old Believers becoming the only official religion in the nation. Preparations would begin for a crusade against the Archon scum so Herzland would be liberated from the oppression of their depraved clique. It was the duty of the brave Greifenmarsian peasants to fight for the freedom and salvation of millions. Those who doubted they could do it, Wilke said, should remember that the Gods were on their side, and that faith alone could overcome all."

In addition a new constitution was drafted and agreed upon, a Central Committee was elected and the country was officially renamed to Greifenmarschen Soviet Socialist Republic. Most importantly, bourgeoisie, priests and excessively wealthy peasants were stripped of their voting rights, which especially pleased Wingbert Rohmer, the General Secretary, who had dreamed of such change for years."

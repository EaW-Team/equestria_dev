PYT_the_peasant_republic:0 "The Peasant Republic"
PYT_the_peasant_republic_desc:0 "The Republic of Peasants was founded in 720 ALB after the peasantry rose up against Duke Erebus Blacktalon - one of Grover I's many early political opponents. The Emperor rewarded the peasantry by allowing them to organise their own government.\n\n Thus Greifenmarschen was created, a peculiar nation even by Griffonian standards. It can safely be called the first griffon Republic, but it can also be considered the most flawed Republic on the continent.\n\n Operating on the principles of total equality and liberty for all of its citizens, quite literally every single minor thing in Greifenmarschen is voted on elections are held every three months. While this system evokes an unmatched sense of loyalty to the Republic it also means that implemeting any sort of reforms is nigh impossible."
PYT_the_peasant_army:0 "The Bauernmiliz"
PYT_the_peasant_army_desc:0 "Greifenmarschen's Army, or rather the Bauernmiliz, suffers from many of the same issues that its government does. Officers and plans are voted upon, any sense of discipline is nonexistent, and any reforms are hard to pass.\n\n On the bright side there is no shortage of eager recruits ready and willing to defend their beloved Republic."
PYT_rural_economy:0 "Ruralism"
PYT_rural_economy_desc:0 "The nature of Greifenmarschen's government and people has made it rather hard to create any proper industrial centers, as such most of our economy is reliant on farming and mining. Physiocracy is a great standard to live by, but it does not provide a considerable return on investment."
PYT_guerilla_warfare_idea:0 "From the Shadows"
PYT_guerilla_warfare_idea_desc:0 "Greifenmarschen's loose, decentralised army structure allows it to wage war from behind enemy lines. What seem like a friendly, unthreatening family of farmers can be vicious partisans by the night."
PYT_born_of_the_land_idea:0 "Born of the Land"
PYT_born_of_the_land_idea_desc:0 "Those with the aptitude to work the land for the majority of their lives can naturally apply their skills towards utilising the terrain in warfare. With a tendency to hide supply caches wherever applicable, the Greifenmarsian soldier is the ideal guerilla."
PYT_volksstrum:0 "Volkssturm"
PYT_volksstrum_desc:0 "Although the Bauernmiliz remains a primarily militia based force, comprised primarily of griffs bringing their own equipment and skills instead of a centralised training program, enthusiasm and volunteer numbers have never been higher. This is attributed to the light clawed approach to reform, preserving Greifenmarsian tradition while enacting modernisation in areas that had no previous precedent."
PYT_actual_officers:0 "Volksoffiziere"
PYT_actual_officers_desc:0 "Previously, officers were chosen by a vote in a squadron. While it made for happy soldiers, it didn't always ensure capable leadership. This system has been scrapped in favour of true professionally trained officers."
PYT_volksarmee:0 "Volksarmee"
PYT_volksarmee_desc:0 "To the anguish of some, Greifenmarschen's beloved militia has been forcefully reformed into a proper armed force resembling its contemporaries, although traces of old traditions have remained. A necessary development in these troubling times, where strict discipline is required to protect our fair land."
PYT_streamlined_training_idea:0 "Streamlined Training"
PYT_streamlined_training_idea_desc:0 "The competence of a soldier in the Bauernmiliz has always been an unknown variable. While everygriff could be counted upon to have experience with firearms from hunting or local gun ranges, how good of a shot they were was a mystery. To eliminate this discrepancy, a standardised training regimen has been implemented for all upcoming recruits."
PYT_rural_economy_1:0 "Agrarianism" 
PYT_rural_economy_1_desc:0 "Greifenmarschen's peasants have decided to focus on maintaining an agricultural economy while modernizing it, neglecting urban development and industry in favour of agrarianism."
PYT_foreign_experts_idea:0 "Öffentliche Bauarbeiten"
PYT_foreign_experts_idea_desc:0 "Several public works projects have begun in Greifenmarschen, funded entirely by the government. They intend to construct new public services for the griffons in the countryside."
PYT_rural_economy_2:0 "Agrarianism"
PYT_rural_economy_2_desc:0 "Greifenmarschen's peasants have decided to focus on maintaining an agricultural economy while modernizing it, neglecting urban development and industry in favour of agrarianism."
PYT_rural_economy_3:0 "Agrarianism"
PYT_rural_economy_3_desc:0 "Greifenmarschen's peasants have decided to focus on maintaining an agricultural economy while modernizing it, neglecting urban development and industry in favour of agrarianism."
PYT_rural_economy_4:0 "Agrarianism"
PYT_rural_economy_4_desc:0 "Greifenmarschen's peasants have decided to focus on maintaining an agricultural economy while modernizing it, neglecting urban development and industry in favour of agrarianism. The final development has resulted in an incredibly advanced primary sector, while the urban areas seem positively quaint compared to them."
PYT_industry_1:0 "Industrialisation"
PYT_industry_1_desc:0 "Greifenmarschen's peasants have decided to focus on industrializing their rural country, developing Oldwingburg and other urban areas in favour of the countryside."
PYT_industry_2:0 "Industrialisation"
PYT_industry_2_desc:0 "Greifenmarschen's peasants have decided to focus on industrializing their rural country, developing Oldwingburg and other urban areas in favour of the countryside."
PYT_industry_3:0 "Industrialisation"
PYT_industry_3_desc:0 "Greifenmarschen's peasants have decided to focus on industrializing their rural country, developing Oldwingburg and other urban areas in favour of the countryside."
PYT_industry_4:0 "Industrialism"
PYT_industry_4_desc:0 "Greifenmarschen's peasants have decided to focus on industrializing their rural country, developing Oldwingburg and other urban areas in favour of the countryside. The final development has resulted in once dominant primary sector to rapidly lose ground to the sheer number of new factories and businesses opened in the industrial areas of Greifenmarschen."
PYT_tech_college_idea:0 "The Oldwingburg Institute of Engineering"
PYT_tech_college_idea_desc:0 "Greifenmarsians have always been a practical people, and to further that notion, an advanced institution dedicated to engineering has been opened in Oldwingburg. Many eagerly await to find out what modern machinery will be created, that will undoubtedly assist in further improvement in industrial and agricultural efficiency."
PYT_the_new_regime:0 "The New Regime"
PYT_the_new_regime_desc:0 "Greifenmarschen's direct democracy system may not have been the most efficient, but it kept the populace happy and content that their voice mattered. Now, with the outright takeover from [PYT.GetRulingParty], many are feeling betrayed by this turn of events. [PYT.GetRulingParty] will have to prove themselves to be capable leaders in these uncertain times."
PYT_hlinka_guard:0 "The Bohngarde"
PYT_hlinka_guard_desc:0 "A paramilitary organisation loyal to [PYT.GetLeader], the Bohngarde recruits griffons from all walks of life, the only thing in common often being agreement to Mach's ideas. Oftentimes, they perform suppressive actions best hidden from public view."
PYT_hlinka_guard_2:0 "The Bohngarde"
PYT_hlinka_guard_2_desc:0 "A paramilitary organisation loyal to [PYT.GetLeader], the Bohngarde recruits griffons from all walks of life, the only thing in common often being agreement to Mach's ideas. Oftentimes, they perform suppressive actions best hidden from public view, and [PYT.GetRulingParty]'s firm control of Greifenmarschen means a membership in the Bohngarde is a prerequisite for further advancement."
PYT_loyalty:0 "Herzland Über Alles!"
PYT_loyalty_desc:0 "A new anthem has been created for the reformed Greifenmarschen, imbued with traditionalist and nationalist themes. It is everygriff's hope someday it will be sung from Rottendedam to Katerinburg."
PYT_the_new_regime_1:0 "The New Regime"
PYT_the_new_regime_1_desc:0 "Greifenmarschen's direct democracy system may not have been the most efficient, but it kept the populace happy and content that their voice mattered. Now, with the outright takeover from [PYT.GetRulingParty], many are feeling betrayed by this turn of events. [PYT.GetRulingParty] will have to prove themselves to be capable leaders in these uncertain times."
PYT_the_new_regime_2:0 "The New Regime"
PYT_the_new_regime_2_desc:0 "Greifenmarschen's direct democracy system may not have been the most efficient, but it kept the populace happy and content that their voice mattered. Now, with the outright takeover from [PYT.GetRulingParty], many are feeling betrayed by this turn of events. [PYT.GetRulingParty] will have to prove themselves to be capable leaders in these uncertain times."
PYT_the_new_regime_3:0 "The New Regime"
PYT_the_new_regime_3_desc:0 "Greifenmarschen's direct democracy system may not have been the most efficient, but it kept the populace happy and content that their voice mattered. Now, with the outright takeover from [PYT.GetRulingParty], many are feeling betrayed by this turn of events. [PYT.GetRulingParty] will have to prove themselves to be capable leaders in these uncertain times."
PYT_corporatism:0 "Corporatism"
PYT_corporatism_desc:0 "A society divided on their common interests, specifically their employment, shall function far more efficiently. Greifenmarschen's unique organisation makes this ideology straightforward to implement, as a rural-urban divide already existed."
PYT_agriculture_support_idea:0 "Bauernfond"
PYT_agriculture_support_idea_desc:0 "Agriculture has greatly progressed since Greifenmarschen was first founded, but it remains a risky occupation. Natural disasters or a bad harvest can ruin a farmer's entire yield, leaving them unable to provide for their family or sell their products. Additionally, advances in agriculture, such as artificial fertilisers, leave those who cannot keep up with expensive novelties behind. Thus it is necessary that the state intervenes to provide the primary sector with the needed resources to flourish."
PYT_volksstrum_red:0 "Röte Volkssturm"
PYT_volksstrum_red_desc:0 "Although the Bauernmiliz remains a primarily militia based force, comprised primarily of griffs bringing their own equipment and skills instead of a centralised training program, enthusiasm and volunteer numbers have never been higher. This is attributed to the light clawed approach to reform, preserving Greifenmarsian tradition while enacting modernisation in areas that had no previous precedent, which now includes an obligatory respect and approval for Comrade Rohmer's ideas."
PYT_volksarmee_red:0 "Röte Volksarmee"
PYT_volksarmee_red_desc:0 "To the anguish of some, Greifenmarschen's beloved militia has been forcefully reformed into a proper armed force resembling its contemporaries, although traces of old traditions have remained. A necessary development in these troubling times, where strict discipline is required to protect our fair land. This was Rohmer's plan all long, as he requires a modern armed force to spread his socialist vision across Herzland."
PYT_RES:0 "The RES"
PYT_RES_desc:0 "Rohmer's directives have resulted in a creation of a specialised force that will be instrumental in the wars to come, consisting of his most zealous followers that are led by aggresively minded officers."
PYT_mobilisied_workers:0 "Heroes of the Revolution"
PYT_mobilisied_workers_desc:0 "There is no higher honour than for a worker to give his all in service of the revolution. All in working roles must be mobilised effectively to assist in the great struggle ahead, lest the socialist dream perishes before it could even spring."
PYT_industry_red:0 "Socialist Industrialism"
PYT_industry_red_desc:0 "Greifenmarschen's peasants have decided to focus on industrializing their rural country, developing Oldwingburg and other urban areas in favour of the countryside. The final development has resulted in once dominant primary sector to rapidly lose ground to the sheer number of new factories and businesses opened in the industrial areas of Greifenmarschen, now further improved by implementation of fair labour laws and other socialist reforms."
PYT_rural_economy_red:0 "Collectivized Agriculture"
PYT_rural_economy_red_desc:0 "Greifenmarschen's peasants have decided to focus on maintaining an agricultural economy while modernizing it, neglecting urban development and industry in favour of agrarianism. The final development has resulted in an incredibly advanced primary sector, while the urban areas seem positively quaint compared to them. Additionally, Rohmer's promises have been fulfilled, leading to peasants having less overall burdens while working together to achieve greater harvests."
PYT_educate_the_populace_idea:0 "Socialist Curriculum"
PYT_educate_the_populace_idea_desc:0 "The revolution needs all to be learned in its goals and methods, since otherwise we only command an angry mob with basic demands. Even if it comes at an expense of more practical knowledge, the socialist thought must be spread far and wide across Greifenmarschen."
PYT_proletartiat_solidarity:0 "International Brigades"
PYT_proletartiat_solidarity_desc:0 "The revolution is not contained to Greifenmarschen itself, it exists everywhere where workers and peasants lie oppressed by their greedy capitalist overlords. It is our obligation to assist the burdened wherever and whenever we are able to."

### Focuses ###
PYT_initial_army_reforms:0 "Reforming the Bauernmiliz"
PYT_initial_army_reforms_desc:0 "For decades now the army of the Republic has remained untouched, becoming increasingly outdated in this age of innovation and revolution. Our faction has finally managed to gather enough supporters who will approve any proposals we might make, but it remains to be decided how exactly the army will be reformed."
PYT_militia_roots:0 "Perfect As Is"
PYT_militia_roots_desc:0 "Our peasant militias have bravely and reliably defended the country from foreign incursions for centuries now, holding the river banks and crushing any noble fool who tried to subdue us. Why change the wheels of a working wagon?"
PYT_call_to_arms:0 "A Call to Arms"
PYT_call_to_arms_desc:0 "The Bauernmiliz is a purely voluntary force, but that fact does not mean that we can not ask our citizens to volunteer. There are surely thousands of willing griffons ready to fight for their country, we need only to put out the word."
PYT_actual_conscription:0 "Fight For Your Home"
PYT_actual_conscription_desc:0 "While the Bauernmiliz may not be as professional a force compared to the other militaries of Griffonia, they do possess their own distinct advantage. They will fight for their homes, their families and their country. And, if necessary, they will die for their homes."
PYT_guerilla_warfare:0 "From the Shadows"
PYT_guerilla_warfare_desc:0 "The Bauernmiliz is not only consigned to our official divisions but rather is comprised of thousands of small cells operating out of our territory. Regardless of our defeat on the battlefield, the Bauernmiliz will continue the fight behind enemy lines, striking from the shadows until they can be liberated by our forces."
PYT_actual_guns:0 "The Right Tools"
PYT_actual_guns_desc:0 "If the Bauernmiliz are to fight on the battlefield, they will need the right tools for the job. There are thousands of citizens who hold surplus weapons and tools, and many would gladly donate them to the Bauernmiliz."
PYT_train_our_troops:0 "Proper Training"
PYT_train_our_troops_desc:0 "By accelerating and streamlining our training regimen we can ensure that the next batch of recruits reaches the front faster and better trained."
PYT_born_of_the_land:0 "Born of the Land"
PYT_born_of_the_land_desc:0 "Our soldiers all have an incredible amount of experience with the land and terrain of our homeland, acquired through generations working and developing the land. We can gather these techniques together to ensure that our forces can subsist in even the harshest conditions."
PYT_stock_the_villages:0 "Stock the Villages"
PYT_stock_the_villages_desc:0 "We must be ready for conflict, and many of our villages are perfect spots for storing equipment for use in emergencies. We can also encourage local production of weapons to further increase our self-sufficiency."
PYT_slight_reforms:0 "The Volkssturm"
PYT_slight_reforms_desc:0 "The methods of the Bauernmiliz have been perfected through our advancements, and it has truly transformed. It is now a true army of the people. The Volkssturm stands ready to fight, and if necessary, die for their homes. Wahr di, Garr, de Buer de kumt!"
PYT_modern_guns:0 "Modern Rifles"
PYT_modern_guns_desc:0 "Due to the lack of the standardization of equipment amongst our forces, many of our soldiers are stuck with woefully out of date rifles. This is not currently a problem, but if we were ever to engage in combat with another nation, our soldiers would quickly be outmatched by their superior equipment. We must invest in designing and researching new rifles to solve this dilemma."
PYT_modern_artillery:0 "Artillery Implementation"
PYT_modern_artillery_desc:0 "Artillery remains a rare sight amongst our forces, with many units of the Bauernmiliz reluctant to adopt them due to a reliance on tradition and an aversion to change. But the prospect of artillery shattering our enemies before a grand attack by the infantry is too enticing to ignore. Artillery is the future, we only need to develop our own models before implementation can begin."
PYT_support_troops:0 "Support Squads"
PYT_support_troops_desc:0 "While most of the volunteers for the Bauernmiliz are excited to fight for their country on the frontlines, there is a distinct lack of support units amongst our forces. While not as exciting as the frontline roles, support roles are equally as vital to the war effort. We shall expand and develop these support units, thus creating a strong support structure for our army."
PYT_radio_implementation:0 "Radio Implementation"
PYT_radio_implementation_desc:0 "The prospective military uses of the radio are practically infinite. With better communication, we can overhaul and streamline our entire command structure. If we can develop our own radio models we can proceed with these ambitious plans."
PYT_motorization:0 "Motorisation"
PYT_motorization_desc:0 "Very few griffons in Greifenmarschen own, or would even recognize a car. But with the existing overhauls of our army in place, we can finally start to motorize our army. Motorized forces have the potential to outperform regular infantry in most aspects, to ignore such an advancement in technology would be folly of the highest order."
PYT_professionalism:0 "Strictly Professional"
PYT_professionalism_desc:0 "It is time for change at last. We are surrounded by nations fielding drilled armies of full-time soldiers. If we are to retain our independence and liberty, we must adapt and modernize our army."
PYT_implement_army_drills:0 "Standardized Equipment"
PYT_implement_army_drills_desc:0 "The Bauernmiliz has no real concept of a standardized piece of equipment, or doctrine for that matter. In the past our soldiers have simply used what was available at the time, and it has worked adequately for our needs in the past. But if we are to drag the Bauernmiliz kicking and screaming into modernity, we will have to establish some sort of standardization amongst our equipment."
PYT_armouries:0 "Proper Armouries"
PYT_armouries_desc:0 "The logistical system of the Bauernmiliz is a nightmare for all involved. Few griffons even know where the majority of the reserve arms are stored, with thousands of small villages having their own set of rifles hidden away in some compartment or another. This insanity must be stopped, we shall gather all of our arms and place them in properly secured and documented facilities."
PYT_instill_discipline:0 "A Sense of Discipline"
PYT_instill_discipline_desc:0 "If the Bauernmiliz is to face our enemies on the battlefield, they must be utterly unshakeable from their duties. If the officers tell them to charge, they must charge. And if the officers tell them to retreat, they must retreat. Such a sense of discipline is currently lacking in our forces but through an intense training program, we can make sure that every single soldier will do his duty when the time comes."
PYT_an_actual_officer_core:0 "A New Officer Core"
PYT_an_actual_officer_core_desc:0 "While the current system of allowing soldiers to elect their officers makes for happy soldiers, it does not make good officers. We must fix this if we are ever to fight in a real war. Our current officers will be tested, those who prove themselves will stay, while those who do not will be demoted. After this, we will ensure that officers will be promoted by merit, thus solving this problem for good."
PYT_the_peoples_army:0 "The Volksarmee"
PYT_the_peoples_army_desc:0 "After an immense amount of reforms and changes, the Bauernmiliz has been transformed into a professional force. Our soldiers stand ready and able to fight with absolute discipline no matter the situation, and our officers now show an air of authority. The title of Bauernmiliz no longer fits our well trained army. Henceforth, it shall be known as the Volksarmee, a proper title for a proper army."
PYT_implement_conscription:0 "Implement Conscription"
PYT_implement_conscription_desc:0 "Conscription is a controversial topic within Greifenmarschen, as membership in the Bauernmiliz has traditionally been a purely voluntary endeavor. But the fact of the matter is that we are already outgunned and outmanned by our potential enemies. Whatever the public may feel about conscription, it is a necessary evil if we are to protect ourselves."
PYT_streamlined_training:0 "Streamlined Training"
PYT_streamlined_training_desc:0 "Currently, basic training in the Bauernmiliz is heavily based on what unit of the militia you join. Many units have unique methods of putting recruits through basic training, causing the average time it takes for a soldier to get ready for combat to vary wildly. To fix this problem, we shall study the methods of the most efficient units and implement them as standard practice across the entire Bauernmiliz."
PYT_auxiliary_roles:0 "Auxiliary Military Roles"
PYT_auxiliary_roles_desc:0 "While frontline fighters may be the most famous amongst our armed forces, they are not by any means the only ones. To truly create an effective fighting force, various support units are necessary to enable the soldiers to fight at their peak capacity. Logistics, maintenance and more are crucial to maintaining a highly effective fighting force, it would be wise to establish such support for the Bauernmiliz."

PYT_the_economy:0 "A New Economy For a New Age"
PYT_the_economy_desc:0 "The new millenium has dawned and with it economic revolution. Farmers abroad use new tools which require less labour, leaving those without work to move to cities. So far we have avoided such change, but our economy is becoming dangerously uncompetitive. Now that our faction has enough popular support, our proposals will be approved by the referendums. It is time to decide how to reform our economy."
PYT_agrarianism:0 "Stick to the Classics"
PYT_agrarianism_desc:0 "Ruralism and agrarianism are defining aspects of our country. Changing these would require changing what we are. We must remain true to ourselves and focus on reforming agriculture, which is the foundation of our existence."
PYT_connect_countryside:0 "Connect the Countryside"
PYT_connect_countryside_desc:0 "Unlike in cities, in rural areas everything is far apart. If we wish for our populace to have easy access to services such as schools, hospices, temples and markets, we must improve our dirt paths into proper paved roads."
PYT_support_local_business:0 "Support Local Businesses"
PYT_support_local_business_desc:0 "Instead of focusing on markets and companies in Oldwingburg, we should aid small businesses in our villages and towns who serve the locals and provide them what they need. This means griffons will be less inclined to move to cities and will instead remain on their farms."
PYT_foreign_experts:0 "Public Works Projects"
PYT_foreign_experts_desc:0 "To reduce unemployment and to increase the availability of services in rural areas, we will begin public works projects intended to build schools, hospitals, wells, sewers and bridges in the underdeveloped countryside. The funding will come entirely from the pockets of the government, instead those of urban entrepreneurs who only care about urban areas."
PYT_initial_modernisation_efforts:0 "Into the Modern Age"
PYT_initial_modernisation_efforts_desc:0 "Now that we have laid the foundations, we can begin to modernize our agrarian country, without necessarily urbanizing it. We will adopt new technologies from abroad, reform education and pass new laws, ultimately proving to the world that modernity does not require sacrificing tradition and identity!"
PYT_distribute_land:0 "Work the Land"
PYT_distribute_land_desc:0 "For decades now griffons have been abandoning farms and moving to towns and cities such as Oldwingburg in search of a living. It is time for this trend to be reversed! The countryside, now having proper infrastructure, shall be repopulated and abandoned land will be reclaimed."
PYT_subsidise_agrculture:0 "Subsidise the Farmers"
PYT_subsidise_agrculture_desc:0 "Instead of supporting the merchants and artisans in urban areas, the government should aid the farmers, especially after poor harvests. With this we will not only ensure further development of the countryside but also receive support from grateful farmers."
PYT_mechanise_agriculture:0 "Agricultural Mechanisation"
PYT_mechanise_agriculture_desc:0 "Our agricultural sector cannot compete with foreign noble estates because of our low and decentralized production. To deal with the issue, we should mechanize our agriculture which will greatly increase production and make the farmers' lives easier."
PYT_finished_reforms:0 "A Green Society"
PYT_finished_reforms_desc:0 "After a series of reforms proposed by our faction, Greifenmarschen has changed while remaining the same. Agriculture is still vital for our economy, society and culture, but it has been modernized and the lives of farmers have greatly improved. With Eyr's blessing, may the Peasants' Republic last forever!"
PYT_mining_techniques:0 "Modern Mining Tools"
PYT_mining_techniques_desc:0 "The earth is the source of most of our wealth. On its surface, we grow our crops, and beneath it we dig and find precious minerals. However, our miners produce little while risking their lives, mostly because of our outdated techniques and tools. We need to import foreign tools and invite foreign experts to revolutionize our mining operations."
PYT_thurwingen_mining:0 "Thurwingian Mines"
PYT_thurwingen_mining_desc:0 "A while ago farmers in Thurwingen claimed they struck rich veins of shining metal while tilling their soil. It is time for us to send the foreign experts we invited to prospect the region and evaluate the size of the deposits. If they are large enough, we will put our new tools to use!"
PYT_oil_wells:0 "Oil In Nortfome"
PYT_oil_wells_desc:0 "Shortly after mining operations in Thurwingen began, miners discovered pockets of crude oil underground. Our foreign experts have conducted seismic surveys and estimated that the oil deposits are part of a much larger reservoir which extends to Nortfome as well and is ultimately part of the massive Adelart petroleum reservoir. We should take advantage of this and fund the construction of oil wells!"
PYT_teach_the_people:0 "Begin the War Against Illiteracy"
PYT_teach_the_people_desc:0 "The stereotype of an uneducated, superstitious and illiterate peasant is unfortunately true for our citizens. If we wish to modernize our nation, we must teach the griffons to read, for it is the foundation for everything modern. Our literacy programs must begin as soon as possible."
PYT_industrialisation:0 "Industrialisation"
PYT_industrialisation_desc:0 "Beyond our borders farmers are abandoning the countryside and moving to urban cities to toil in factories. The workers have better access to services such as education and gain better wages. It is clear that to improve our own lives, we must embrace modernity which we fear so greatly."
PYT_buy_the_land:0 "Buy Out the Farmers"
PYT_buy_the_land_desc:0 "If we wish for our cities to expand, we must acquire the surrounding farmlands. The peasant families have held them for centuries, but all we need to do to persuade them to sell their lands is offer them enough Idols."
PYT_oil:0 "Black Gold"
PYT_oil_desc:0 "As surveys were being completed on the land we had recently acquired, we discovered pockets of petroleum underground. This is great news for us, for with oil production industrialization will be much easier and our economy will strengthen. Oil wells must be constructed at once!"
PYT_dig_deeper:0 "Dig Deep and Dig Greedily"
PYT_dig_deeper_desc:0 "Several exploration wells we built have shown that the oil deposits are part of the vast Adelart reservoir, meaning that with slant drilling we can greatly increase our oil production. Griffons in Adelart surely won't mind if we claim our fair share of the treasure."
PYT_synthethic:0 "Synthethic Oil Experiments"
PYT_synthethic_desc:0 "While we have more than enough oil production now, it might be wise to invest in syntethic oil, considering how the oil wells will eventually run dry. It is a long-term investment that will hopefully pay off."
PYT_rapid_industrialisation:0 "The March of Progress"
PYT_rapid_industrialisation_desc:0 "We are far behind neighbouring nations such as Feathisia, Aquileia and the Empire, with our economy largely agrarian. Now that we have enough land, we can rent plots for a low price, construct new factories and subsidise our industrialists so our industry can massively expand. We must take expensive loans but it will ultimately be worthwhile."
PYT_railroad:0 "The Great Railroad"
PYT_railroad_desc:0 "Our transportation still relies mostly on dirt roads and the only railroad in our country is an old and dilapidated one, built years ago to connect Oldwingburg with Romau. That railroad must be renovated and expanded, its capacity and length greatly increased. Ultimately all railroads in Greifenmarschen shall lead to Oldwingburg, the growing industrial heart of our country."
PYT_arms_industry:0 "Domestic Arms Industry"
PYT_arms_industry_desc:0 "For years now our soldiers have used Imperial armouries and local gunsmiths to arm themselves. If we wish to modernize our army, we have to use standardized weaponry produced exclusively in our efficient factories. Instead of our militiagriffs buying any weapons they wish, our army will acquire exclusvely domestic equipment and give it to our soldiers."
PYT_industrialisation_finish:0 "An Industrial Nation"
PYT_industrialisation_finish_desc:0 "Our reforms are finally bearing fruit and the population of Oldwingburg and other towns is growing rapidly, with the countryside being abandoned. Businesses are booming, new factories open without aid from us and the wages of factory workers have surpassed those of farmers. We are finally becoming an industrialized, modern nation. May our neighbours no longer mock us for our backwardness!"
PYT_tech_college:0 "The Oldwingburg Institute of Engineering"
PYT_tech_college_desc:0 "If we wish to industrialize our nation, we need experts who can design and create modern machines, and those experts should not be expensive ones hired from abroad. By founding a specialized institution where engineers can study and work, our country will not lack educated minds which we sorely need."
PYT_societal_advancement:0 "Here and Now"
PYT_societal_advancement_desc:0 "We must take decisive action to modernize our nation. Education will be reformed and made available for free for the masses, and new economic laws should be passed to liberalize our protectionist economy."
PYT_modern_methods:0 "Modern Industrial Methods"
PYT_modern_methods_desc:0 "Now that we have many talented engineers working for us, we can begin a program to implement more efficient production methods. Assembly lines, numerous machines and electric factory lighting shall all herald the beginning of a new age in Greifenmarschen."
PYT_research_slot:0 "State Funded Universities"
PYT_research_slot_desc:0 "Any young griffons in our country who wish to attain a higher education have no option but to move across the river to Yale. Oftentimes they graduate there and move to other countries to work. We must found our own universities and generously fund them so we have enough talented teachers for all the eager students who can now stay in their beloved homeland."

PYT_navy_stuff:0 "Founding a Navy"
PYT_navy_stuff_desc:0 "For the first time in our nation's history we have claimed coastline, the vast and terrifying ocean finally within our sight. Many threats lurk beyond the horizon, and we must prepare for their arrival and build ships of war. The locals will be able to aid us in this effort."
PYT_base_strike_f:0 "Strike at the Heart"
PYT_base_strike_f_desc:0 "The core of our enemies will not always be vulnerable to a direct attack. Often a nations true naval strength lies not directly in its Navy, but in the ports and dockyards which supply and repair it. But through the use of carriers and submarines, we can deliver crippling blows to this critical portion of our foes industry, while protecting our own."
PYT_carrier_f:0 "Carrier Experiments"
PYT_carrier_f_desc:0 "Carriers have the potential to completely revolutionize naval warfare. Through the combined might of the navy and the airforce, almost limitless tactical and strategic possibilities present themselves. But before any of that can be done, we need to actually develop a solid carrier model."
PYT_navy_planes_f:0 "Naval Aviation"
PYT_navy_planes_f_desc:0 "To deal with the unique challenges that come with carrier-based operations, new models and designs of planes must be developed. With each improvement to our carrier-based planes the strategic potential of our carriers increased, we would truly be mad to ignore this avenue of advancement."
PYT_fleet_being_f:0 "A Show of Force"
PYT_fleet_being_f_desc:0 "Our ports are the most critical part of our naval strength, as without them our navy would not last long unsupplied. By constructing a fleet focused on large battleships we can simply intimidate the enemy fleets, forcing them to stay away from our home waters while we build up the navy. And a few battleships certainly wouldn't hurt the national pride either."
PYT_dockyards:0 "A Home Port"
PYT_dockyards_desc:0 "To fuel our newly established naval efforts, a true home port is required. By constructing several new dockyards we can meet the demand for our navy, and provide a new destination for trade to arrive in our nation."
PYT_battlecruiser_f:0 "Bigger Ships"
PYT_battlecruiser_f_desc:0 "In order to stay competitive with the navies of other nations, we must constantly develop and expand our hulls. Bigger is better as they say, and we can certainly go bigger than our current models."
PYT_light_cruiser_f:0 "Light Cruisers"
PYT_light_cruiser_f_desc:0 "In order to meet the ever more stringent demands of our navy, our light cruiser models must be improved. The armor and armaments of our current models can almost certainly be improved, and if we have to break a few naval treaties to accomplish this, so be it."
PYT_battleship_f:0 "Battleships"
PYT_battleship_f_desc:0 "The pride of every nation, building and designing a proper battleship is a truly daunting task. But with the ever-expanding naval capacity of our nation combined with the latest advancements in naval technology have now made this feasible. The time has come to construct a true flagship for our navy."
PYT_expand_dockyards:0 "Dockyard Expansion"
PYT_expand_dockyards_desc:0 "Our ever-expanding navy now devours resources and griffonpower at a steady rate, and to meet this massive new demand multiple new dockyards will be constructed. A navy cannot exist without dockyards after all."
PYT_marine_f:0 "Create a Marine Core"
PYT_marine_f_desc:0 "The nature of modern war has rendered amphibious operations a necessity. Rather than throwing our normal forces at the beaches untrained and unready for their task, we shall create a new arm of the Navy specifically to deal with these landings, creating soldiers who can truly thrive in an amphibious environment."
PYT_transport_f:0 "Modern Transport Vessels"
PYT_transport_f_desc:0 "As our amphibious operations expand, the demand for new and better-equipped transport vessels does as well. By improving our existing designs we can deliver more soldiers to the battlefield faster and more efficiently than before."
PYT_trade_indirection_f:0 "Striking at the Lifelines"
PYT_trade_indirection_f_desc:0 "Against a truly overwhelming opponent, we cannot risk a direct confrontation. But the latest advancements in submarine technology provide another option. By constructing a large fleet of submarines and through developing new tactics based around these submarines we can simply cut off all trade to our enemies. A massive navy is of little use when there is no oil to fuel it after all."
PYT_destroyer_f:0 "Patrol Boats"
PYT_destroyer_f_desc:0 "Not every task requires the biggest guns in the navy. Patroling the coastline and supporting the larger ships are roles that are much better filled with smaller ships. By leveraging their small size and ease of production our destroyers might be able to punch above their weight class."
PYT_submarine_f:0 "U-Boat Experiments"
PYT_submarine_f_desc:0 "The potential to strike our enemies ships unseen, hunting their fleets across the oceans and waiting for the perfect moment to strike, is truly tantalizing. By conditioning new designs of submarines, we can better realize this potential."

PYT_air_stuff:0 "Flying High"
PYT_air_stuff_desc:0 "Griffons were born to fly, to pierce the sky and enjoy true freedom. But despite the abilities granted by our wings, the limitations of biology have always prevented us from soaring too fast or too high. But with the latest innovations in airframes, we can shatter those limits, and griffonkind will know fewer limits in the sky than ever before."
PYT_fighter_projects:0 "Wings of Steel"
PYT_fighter_projects_desc:0 "Our current airframes are laughably outdated, and our first step in achieving dominance of the sky once more should be to update our fighter models. We have little to be concerned about from enemy planes if our fighters simply rip them to shreds after all."
PYT_doctrinal_development:0 "High Altitude Training"
PYT_doctrinal_development_desc:0 "Despite being more naturally suited to the skies than most species, excessive altitudes can still heavily hamper a griffon pilots capabilities in the field. By training our pilots at these extreme altitudes we can gradually wean them to the massive heights that they will have to endure as professional pilots, granting us a tactical advantage over our enemies."
PYT_actual_air_bases:0 "The Asselt Airfields"
PYT_actual_air_bases_desc:0 "While airplanes were never particularly popular in Greifenmarschen, there was the odd griffon known to own a plane back in the day. A defunct aerodrome now sits in Asselt, and its location makes it perfect to establish a new airfield upon. Our planes are little more than steel deathtraps with no place to land after all."
PYT_strat:0 "Strategic Bomber Effort"
PYT_strat_desc:0 "By striking our enemies critical wartime industries, we can potentially rob them of their abilities to supply their troops in the field with equipment. As the most critical industries are often the most well-guarded ones, a specialized type of bomber will have to be developed to carry and drop the bombs on our enemies industrial centers."
PYT_tact:0 "Tactical Bomber Effort"
PYT_tact_desc:0 "Why fire guns at our enemies from the ground when we can simply blow them up from the sky? By developing new tactical bombers to destroy enemy forces we can significantly damage our enemies divisions before they have a chance to engage with our ground troops."
PYT_napalm:0 "Napalm"
PYT_napalm_desc:0 "Napalm has proven itself to be a particularly useful tool during wartime. Burning at the same temperature as gasoline and for far longer intervals, as well as sticking tenaciously to its targets. This substance is almost perfect for its usage in payloads for our bombers, serving as a perfect weapon to use against structures and infantry."
PYT_CAS_projects:0 "Claws of Iron"
PYT_CAS_projects_desc:0 "Though they may lack the heavier payloads of our tactical bombers, our close air support frames still serve a vital role in our combat operations. By attacking and destroying smaller targets of opportunity during battle, close are support can easily turn the tide of battles if used properly."
PYT_heavy_fighter_projects:0 "Guarding Our Skies"
PYT_heavy_fighter_projects_desc:0 "In order to provide an effective escort for our strategic bombers, a new design of fighter must be developed. Sporting heavier armaments, and being all around heavier and less agile, than a regular fighter, these planes can comfortably escort our bombers. And will provide a  tough foe to all enemy interceptors seeking to destroy our bombers."
PYT_rocket_projects:0 "Rocketry Projects"
PYT_rocket_projects_desc:0 "While many consider them a novelty of warfare, rockets hold immense potential both as a means of propelling our aircraft and as a weapon in and of themselves. Investing in testing sites and new rocket designs is only prudent at this point."
PYT_paratrooper_project:0 "The Screaming Eagles"
PYT_paratrooper_project_desc:0 "Jumping from altitudes that even the bravest griffons would have considered insane only a few years ago, our elite paratroopers can handily land behind enemy lines to cause havoc. And as their equipment gets more sophisticated, their potential strategic and tactical uses increase as well."
PYT_expanded_bases:0 "Expand the Asselt Air Fields"
PYT_expanded_bases_desc:0 "To meet the demands of our expanding airforce, and to provide the necessary capacity for further expansion, the already sizable airfields at Asselt must be expanded once more."
PYT_jet_fighters:0 "The V-1 Jet Fighter"
PYT_jet_fighters_desc:0 "After multiple prototypes and false-starts, the first ever viable model for a jet-powered fighter produced by our designers approaches. With even more investment we can enter into a new age of aviation, flying planes at speeds that would make the common griffon speechless."

PYT_the_national_republic:0 "The National Republic"
PYT_the_national_republic_desc:0 "Dietrich Mach and his deputy Wilke Truthahn, figureheads of the nationalist NAP faction, have successfully seized power in Greifenmarschen. The Council has been disbanded after its members were forced to swear loyalty to the new rulers of the country. Now Dietrich and Wilke can finally pass reforms they've desired for so long."
PYT_mobilise_the_people:0 "Mobilise The People"
PYT_mobilise_the_people_desc:0 "Every griffon in Greifenmarschen is a citizen and every citizen is a soldier. Yet only few are in active duty as participation in the Bauernmiliz is mostly voluntary. This must change at once! Our proud peasants must take up arms and prepare to unite Herzland!"
PYT_the_partys_army:0 "Officialise the Bohngarde"
PYT_the_partys_army_desc:0 "The Bohngarde, the unofficial paramilitary wing of NAP named after Edwin Bohn, the founder of the faction, has served us well for many years. It is time we reward them for their loyalty by turning them into the official state police of Greifenmarschen, responsible for ensuring internal security and guarding the lives of NAP members."
PYT_loyalty_officers:0 "Bohngarde Loyalty Officers"
PYT_loyalty_officers_desc:0 "To ensure our militiagriffs remain absolutely loyal to their beloved fatherland, we will integrate the Bohngarde with the Bauernmiliz. Officers will ensure national fervour in the ranks and punish those traitors who do not care about our noble cause."
PYT_hey_slovaci:0 ""Herzland Über Alles!""
PYT_hey_slovaci_desc:0 "Our leader has commissioned a talented musician from Nortfome to write an official anthem for a united Herzland. The song will be called 'Herzland Über Alles!', its lyrics will be written in Griffish and it will be imbued with nationalist and militarist themes, saying how Herzland will always stand firm and proud above all other nations."
PYT_reinforce_power:0 "Consolidate Our Grip"
PYT_reinforce_power_desc:0 "If we are to strike at the heart of the Empire and liberate Herzland, we must be united and strong. Those who wish to weaken and divide us from within will be taken care of and our corrupt democratic institutions will be reformed. Hesitation in Greifenmarschen will die and be replaced by glorious determination!"
PYT_control_knowledge:0 "Control Knowledge"
PYT_control_knowledge_desc:0 "To guard our country from within, we must seize the printing presses and nationalize them. Nothing shall be printed without explicit permission and approval from NAP. Book burnings shall also be organized across the country as we must cleanse Greifenmarschen from corrupt, degenerate and weak ideas."
PYT_control_the_people:0 "Totalitarian Democracy"
PYT_control_the_people_desc:0 "For almost two centuries have the people held power in Greifenmarschen. As such, they are resistant to the idea of NAP leaders remaining in control and deciding everything. Internal dissent must not divide us ever again, but perhaps we can let them vote after all. The results of referendums will require approval from our leader and voting will be closely monitored by the Bohngarde."
PYT_remove_truthahn:0 "Dispose of Truthahn"
PYT_remove_truthahn_desc:0 "Deputy Wilke Truthahn has long seen Dietrich as an upstart rival, and now that NAP is in power the cooperation between the two has completely collapsed, with daily arguments and disagreements. The old loonie is now nothing more but a thorn on our side. Dietrich's patience has ran out and he now plans to ask Wilke to resign. With most of NAP loyal to him, it would be unwise for Wilke to say no."
PYT_staff_the_council:0 "Staff the Council"
PYT_staff_the_council_desc:0 "The Council was an integral institution of Greifenmarschen that had been disbanded during the coup. Now our leader is finally prepared to reinstate it like he had promised, but with many changes. Mostly that it would be little more than a puppet government filled with NAP loyalists, its members saying yes to anything the leader proposes."
PYT_control_the_government:0 "Outlaw 'Disloyal' Factions"
PYT_control_the_government_desc:0 "GKVP, KPG and GVHP are nothing more than bands of traitors and pacifist cowards. Their members have already sworn undying loyalty to NAP, but can they truly be trusted? It is clear these illegal gangs should be disbanded and their leaders arrested, for they are nothing more than tumours."
PYT_mobilise_the_economy:0 "Mobilise the Economy"
PYT_mobilise_the_economy_desc:0 "Preparations must begin for the grand unification campaigns. The underdeveloped economy of Greifenmarschen needs to be able to support a massive war effort! We must greatly increase our military expenditure, draft workers and confiscate resources needed by our army."
PYT_corporate_economy:0 "Implement Corporatism"
PYT_corporate_economy_desc:0 "The economy won't become strong on its own. The guiding claw of state-owned corporations, all managing different sectors, will ensure planned and quick growth. In addition corporatism can be used to reduce opposition to our rule and reward those loyal to us."
PYT_industry_grows:0 "Industrial Grants"
PYT_industry_grows_desc:0 "Money will be loaned en masse, then used to fund the construction of new factories and to support our corporations. This is guaranteed to result in rapid economic growth, creating new workplaces and boosting our production capabilities. The resulting debts will be taken care of once we loot the treasuries of our enemies!"
PYT_agricultural_support:0 "Blood and Soil"
PYT_agricultural_support_desc:0 "While industrialization is necessary for the liberation war, we cannot forget the peasants of the countryside who are true Greifenmarsians and the foundation of our nation. Rural values are bound to our blood! We should grant farmland to the unemployed urban workers and generously aid farmers with a state-owned fund, the Bauernfond."
PYT_the_road_to_herzland:0 "In Die Bresche!"
PYT_the_road_to_herzland_desc:0 "For too long has Herzland been divided between fat aristocrat lords and weakened by tyranny. It was time at last to liberate all Herzlanders and unite them under one banner! The selfish nobles and the unreliable Archons will all receive their punishments for oppressing the people for generations. Onwards, brave Herzlanders! To death and glorious victory!"

PYT_the_peoples_republic:0 "The Revolutionary Republic"
PYT_the_peoples_republic_desc:0 "Wingbert Rohmer, leader of the communist KPG faction, has led a swift and firm revolution in Greifenmarschen. The Council has been disbanded after its members were arrested and accused of betraying the griffons who had voted for them. Now Wingbert, unimpeded by cumbersome democracy, can save the proletariat from encroaching capitalism."
PYT_red_army:0 "The Greifenmarschen Red Army"
PYT_red_army_desc:0 "The dark threat of the evil Empire looms threateningly over us all. We must prepare our griffons to fight for their freedom, to the death if need be! Our military must be reformed, and no longer will capitalists and nationalists stand in our way. Bauernmiliz shall become a proper army of the proletariat!"
PYT_red_commandos:0 "Revolutionäre Expeditionsabteilung"
PYT_red_commandos_desc:0 "We cannot deny that we are few in number, while our enemies are numerous. Without quantity, we must focus on quality. A special expeditionary division will be formed, consisting of the most skilled and loyal soldiers of KPG. Our finest officers shall lead them to victory!"
PYT_loyal_officers:0 "Fresh Blood"
PYT_loyal_officers_desc:0 "The reactionaries, capitalists and aristocrats beyond our borders outnumber us greatly! Our revolution cannot be crushed before it has even properly begun. Participation in the Bauernmiliz has long been voluntary, but the dire situation demands that this changes. The old Council would've never approved this, but we must implement forced conscription. Otherwise we will be slain and enslaved."
PYT_mass_mobilisation:0 "Mobilise the Workers"
PYT_mass_mobilisation_desc:0 "We still do not have enough soldiers! More is needed to fight the oppressors abroad. We have no choice but to conscript the workers, whose loyalty to our revolution cannot be doubted. They will fight fanatically to protect their livelihood and their families! Unfortunately the workshops, factories and farms will be emptier than before, but this is a temporary measure."
PYT_the_road_to_communism:0 "The First KPG Party Congress"
PYT_the_road_to_communism_desc:0 "It is time for Greifenmarschen to become a true communist state, modeled after Stalliongrad and the writings of comrade Caramel Marks. Wingbert and his fellow KPG members will begin preparations for a grand conference where representatives of all workers' councils will come together to reform Greifenmarschen."
PYT_the_trust_of_the_people:0 "The People's Trust"
PYT_the_trust_of_the_people_desc:0 "Many in our nation still doubt and distrust us, instead of eagerly welcoming the revolution which only seeks to make their lives better.

PYT_educate_the_populace:0 "Teach the People"
PYT_educate_the_populace_desc:0 "Long have we complained that our education system has been tainted by bourgeois ideas.

PYT_deal_with_bourgoise_desc:0 "By expanding and strengthening the People's Army we ensure our safety from external threats, but further measures must be taken to counter the threats within.

PYT_model_citizens:0 "Model Citizens"
PYT_model_citizens_desc:0 "Some of the peasants and workers in Greifenmarschen are shining examples of the ideal proletariat, selflessly labouring day and night to ensure their family earns a living.

PYT_the_five_year_plan:0 "Planned Economy"
PYT_the_five_year_plan_desc:0 "Now that we have confiscated the means of production from the capitalist scum, we are able to centralize our economy and control it with precision.

PYT_nationalisation:0 "It Belongs to the State"

PYT_ducal_guard_desc:0 "The old ducal guard represented the elite of the army of Greifenheim. They swore an oath to the duke himself, promising to give their lives for his should the need arise. Recreating this organization would no doubt be a wise idea."

PYT_legacy_of_erebus_i_desc:0 "Erebus the First was a true hero who stood with his guard to the end against the peasant hordes that accosted him. At least, that will be the official story. And our dear Duke Erebus the second will do his utmost to honor his legacy of strength and courage."

PYT_fight_the_commies_desc:0 "Communists, socialists, and their deluded ilk have no place in our new society. The workers will work, and they will do so for the good of the duke. If they refuse, well we have no shortage of empty graves that need filling in Greifenheim."
PYT_fight_the_democrats:0 "Crush the Opposition"
PYT_fight_the_democrats_desc:0 "The Greifenmarschen Volksharmonie-Partei is our only remaining rival in Griffenheim.

PYT_advisory_parliament:0 "An Advisory Council"
PYT_advisory_parliament_desc:0 "With our opponents either dead or accepting of the Duke's authority, we must now reward those loyal to the true ruler of Greifenheim.

PYT_righting_old_wrongs:0 "Righting Old Wrongs"
PYT_righting_old_wrongs_desc:0 "Erebus the First always dreamed to sit upon the throne of the Griffonian Empire, and yet this was a dream that was never realized.

PYT_fight_the_fascists:0 "Eradicate the NAP"
PYT_fight_the_fascists_desc:0 "The Nationale Aktionspartei is filled with traitors. Not a single one among their ranks can claim to be loyal to the Duke, and with each second that they are allowed to remain active their threat grows.

PYT_ducal_industries_desc:0 "Our economy is in dire need of something to guide it, to steer the market in a direction that pleases the Duke. The Herzoglicher Industrierat will ensure that our industries are all working together to ensure maximum efficiency, nothing less would do for the Duke."
PYT_modernism:0 "Modernisation Effort"
PYT_modernism_desc:0 "The idiotic democratic system used by the peasants was not very conducive to industrialization, with the peasants prefering to vote on every single brick laid down than any real economic progress.

PYT_a_guided_democracy_desc:0 "Erebus Whiteplume has been forced to do the unthinkable and seize complete control over the apparatus of the state.

PYT_army_standardization:0 "Military Standardisation"
PYT_army_standardization_desc:0 "The military of Greifenmarschen has always maintained a unique structure, in essence mirroring the state of its nation. This has spawned some truly perplexing ideas about how a military should be run. While it may anger them, the military cannot be allowed to maintain their outdated ways when war seems just behind the horizon."
PYT_guardians_of_freedom:0 "Guardians of Freedom"
PYT_guardians_of_freedom_desc:0 "While Greifenmarschen may have changed drastically in the last few months, it still remains a republic.

PYT_military_police_f:0 "Accountability"
PYT_military_police_f_desc:0 "Greifenmarschen may be a dictatorship ruled by the GKVP, but this does not grant the members of the government the right to do whatever they please.

PYT_centralisation_of_power:0 "Centralisation"
PYT_centralisation_of_power_desc:0 "Greifenmarschen suffered from an inefficient and decentralized system of management.

PYT_prepare_for_battle_desc:0 "The Griffonian Empire has set its covetous sight upon us, ready to bring our republic to an end. But the griffons of Greifenmarschen are ready for whatever they may throw at us. Let them come, they shall pay a high price to deprive us of our freedom."
PYT_clarification_of_voting:0 "Redefine Voting Laws"
PYT_clarification_of_voting_desc:0 "Greifenmarschen is one of the oldest republics in existence, and due to it we have ended up with a system of voting that could be described as insane. Everything has to be voted on, no matter how large or small the issue. Not only has this paralyzed Greifenmarschen in the past and present, but it is also a very expensive system to maintain. It will have to be removed."
PYT_new_cities:0 "Neuestädte Programm"
PYT_new_cities_desc:0 "Greifenmarschen is in dire need of new griffons to settle the portions of our land that we have not been able to settle ourselves.

PYT_projects:0 "State Industrial Programs"
PYT_projects_desc:0 "In order to bring our outdated economy into the modern age, a series of government programs designed to accelerate the process of modernization have been proposed. These would all have been voted on in the past, but a dictatorship does allow us to grease the wheels of democracy a bit."
PYT_agriculture:0 "Supporting Our Farmers"
PYT_agriculture_desc:0 "Agriculture is critical for Greifenmarschen and constitutes a large portion of its economy. But the recent upheavals on Griffonia have made many of our farmers destitute, and barely able to produce enough for themselves. To alleviate this problem, a large program designed to support these farmers has been proposed, it only needs final approval to be implemented."

PYT_harmony_prevails:0 "Harmony In Our Time"
PYT_harmony_prevails_desc:0 "Archibald Dawnfeather and his friends of the harmonist GVHP faction have unexpectedly risen to power in Greifenmarschen.

After the incident, Archibald is more confident than ever that Greifenmarschen desperately needs harmony."
PYT_the_griffon_path_to_harmony:0 "The Griffon Path to Harmony"
PYT_the_griffon_path_to_harmony_desc:0 "While harmonic and liberal values work well in Equestria, Archibald has realized he cannot simply impose them on a completely different culture and race. So instead, Greifenmarschen will mix Equestrian values with native ones."

PYT_paladins_desc:0 "What's a Paladin? Well, legends say they were trusted companions and champions of Emperor Grover I, legendary knights whose virtue and valour were without compare.

PYT_ambrosian_republic:0 "The Ambrosian Republic"
PYT_ambrosian_republic_desc:0 "Equestrian society is held together by loyalty and devotion to the benevolent God-Princesses. Therefore our republic must be united by veneration and worship of the sacred griffon Pantheon and the three primary Gods who rule above all lesser things."

PYT_blessings_of_arcturius_desc:0 "As the dark clouds of war loom over us, we must pray to Arcturius the Strong, God of War, the mighty warrior whose followers are blessed with sacred strength.

PYT_gods_chosen_people:0 "The Gods' Chosen People"
PYT_gods_chosen_people_desc:0 "It is clear Greifenmarschen is a blessed nation and Greifenmarsians are a blessed people. In our holy republic all children of the Gods are free and devoted to the deities themselves instead of idols or pompous priests."

PYT_jobs_for_the_people:0 "Jobs For the People"
PYT_jobs_for_the_people_desc:0 "Of course, if we want griffons to move into the cities we must give them a reason to do so. Investing in urban arms industry will provide hundreds of well-paying jobs waiting for talented griffons to take them."

PYT_harmony_must_be_fought_for_desc:0 "As the changelings threaten the Equestrian way of life, so too does the cursed Empire threaten the Greifenmarsian way of life.

PYT_the_equestrian_model:0 "The Equestrian Model"
PYT_the_equestrian_model_desc:0 "Equestria is the greatest, most advanced and most prosperous nation in the entire world. Clearly it would be utterly foolish not to follow their example and mould our nation in its image!"
PYT_the_new_nobility:0 "The New Nobility"
PYT_the_new_nobility_desc:0 "While the aristocrats of Canterlot are wealthier than the common pony citizens, they use their wealth for charity and invest it in projects that boost the economy. Clearly nobles can be a good thing as long as there are some restrictions to their power. Soon Oldwingburg too shall host opulent parties just like the marble capital of Equestria."
PYT_school_for_gifted_griffons:0 "Dawnfeather's School For Gifted Griffons"
PYT_school_for_gifted_griffons_desc:0 "Princess Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns has trained many capable magic users and allowed some exceptional individuals such as Twilight Sparkle to rise to fame thanks to their exceptional abilities.

PYT_chamber_of_commerce:0 "Chamber of Commerce"

PYT_peasants_no_more_desc:0 "Equestrian laws are very liberal, ensuring freedom for all citizens, yet at the same time the safety and well-being of everypony is guaranteed as well. Clearly this law code is the best one our free Principality could hope to have, so we should adapt it with minimal changes."
PYT_harmonic_parliamentarism:0 "Harmonic Parliamentarism"
PYT_harmonic_parliamentarism_desc:0 "Equestria is not, of course, an absolutist despotic monarchy. Numerous municipalities have a relatively large degree of autonomy and elect their own mayors. However, Greifenheim is too small for such a decentralized approach, and as such Archibald wishes to found a Parliament composed of locally elected representatives, similar to the Council of old."
PYT_the_harmonic_army:0 "An Army For The People"

PYT_take_bronzehill_strawberry_desc:0 "There are some who argue that Strawberry and Bronzehill are not Herzlander at all, that the griffons speak a dialect similar to Feathisian and that foreign diamond dogs inhabit the mountains.

PYT_the_new_archons:0 "The New Archons"
PYT_the_new_archons_desc:0 "The old Archons were imperialist puppeteers of the Child-Emperor who sought to control the Empire for their own personal gain. Such wicked priests did not deserve their titles! Now new pious and humble Archons will take their place, claw-picked by Dietrich himself."

PYT_the_new_universities_desc:0 "Higher education is all well and good, but are subjects such as arts, literature, history, sociology and philosophy really needed?

PYT_the_segregation_act:0 "The Segregation Act"
PYT_the_segregation_act_desc:0 "There are two types of citizens in our nation: native, pure-blooded Herzlanders and... "others".

PYT_limit_the_feathisians:0 "Limit the Feathisians"
PYT_limit_the_feathisians_desc:0 "It is truly abhorrent that the largest nation in Herzland before the unification was Feathisia. The vile swamp griffons greedily seized land from true Herzlanders and colonized it. We must drive them back into their marshes!"
PYT_segregated_units:0 "Segregation In the Military"
PYT_segregated_units_desc:0 "Having members of lesser races and nationalities serve alongside our pure-blooded citizenry is a recipe for disaster.

PYT_the_highways:0 "Military Railroads"
PYT_the_highways_desc:0 "Herzland is vast and marching across it would take weeks or perhaps even months. We must make massive troop movements possible, for we may be attacked from any direction!

PYT_the_docks_desc:0 "In the mouth of the great Griffking river is the primary harbour of Herzland, Rottendedam. It is our gateway into the wider world and allows us to access the markets of Equestria and Zebrica. Therefore corporations must expand it even more and make it a truly vast harbour."

PYT_ideological_purges:0 "Purges"
PYT_ideological_purges_desc:0 "During our wars to liberate Herzland, many joined our party and our membership swelled.

PYT_continue_collectivization:0 "Continue Collectivisation"
PYT_continue_collectivization_desc:0 "While Greifenmarschen's means of production have been thoroughly collectivized, the same cannot be said for the rest of Herzland.

To this end former cossack lands will serve well. There is currently no better use for these plains anyway at the moment, and presence of veterans will help with pacifying the rebellious land."
PYT_core_frontier_2:0 "A Secure Frontier"
PYT_core_frontier_2_desc:0 "At last we are masters of the east. Once proud and independent cossacks and Gryphusians are integrated into our great Empire. In time they will come to accept the state of things. Altough we now share wide border with the ponies. Perhaps it is time to invest in fortifications."
PYT_attack_GRF:0 "Subjugate The Colony"
PYT_attack_GRF_desc:0 "Now that we have conquered all the lands of former Empire it is time to reclaim its wayward colony in Equus. It is only fair to do so. Afterall ponies have their own colony on our continent."
PYT_master_of_griffonkind:0 "Master of All Griffonkind"
PYT_master_of_griffonkind_desc:0 "At last we are victorious. All the griffon nations are subjugated under our rule. From north to south, from northern reaches of equus to riverlands we are truly masters of all griffonkind. Surely his Grace, Emperor Erebus I, is nothing but proud of us. All hail the Emperor!"

PYT_take_katerin_and_angriver_democratic:0 "Liberate The Scheißwald"
PYT_take_katerin_and_angriver_democratic_desc:0 "As the republic spreads, one of our first priorities must be to reclaim the Scheißwald. Not only are they part of the Herzland, but if the Eastern ponies would threaten us we need to be ready to face them from the get-go."
PYT_take_romau_and_yale_democratic:0 "Liberate Romau"
PYT_take_romau_and_yale_democratic_desc:0 "Glorious Romau, a city of history and faith both and ancient seat of the Archons. Since time immemorial they have held sway there, but now we must undertake the grim task of dealing with them, lest they threaten our fledgeling republic."
PYT_take_bronzehill_strawberry_democratic:0 "Liberate The North"
PYT_take_bronzehill_strawberry_democratic_desc:0 "The Strawberry Duchy and Bronzehill are both important parts of the Heartlands, not only for their mines but for being the gateway to the far north. Let us hope they will see reason."
PYT_take_feathisia_democratic:0 "Liberate Feathisia"
PYT_take_feathisia_democratic_desc:0 "Feathisia and especially the city of Rottendedam is the great harbor city of the Herzland and was so for centuries. What more, the Feathisians have a democratic tradition of their own, however peculiar it is. Hopefully we can come to terms with them."
PYT_the_holy_republic:0 "A Holy Republic"
PYT_the_holy_republic_desc:0 "Despite the great challenges set before us we rose to the challenge and prevailed. Now we shall face the future together as a people not ruled by emperosr but by chosen leaders and not devoted to greed but to faith and friendship."
PYT_no_more_archons:0 "No More Archons"
PYT_no_more_archons_desc:0 "The Archons have always been fixtures of the griffon faith, but the events of these last months and years have left us questioning their purpose. They were meant to be spiritual guides and not political strongmen, but that is not what happened. Ours is a republic of equals, and we cannot allow the Archons to continue meddling in the affairs of free griffons."
PYT_the_will_of_boreas:0 "The Will Of Boreas"
PYT_the_will_of_boreas_desc:0 "We are a nation of free griffons, and the one king we will acknowledge is Boreas. Gods and griffs are dissimilar, and in our republic we can remember the One King and implement his doctrine more perfectly than before."
PYT_herzland_central_bank:0 "The Herzland Central Bank"
PYT_herzland_central_bank_desc:0 "Money is the lifeblood of society and we must make sure that we can control the ebb and flow of our currency. Establishing a large central bank will let us democratize money as well instead of tying it to empowered elites."
PYT_invisible_claw:0 "The Invisible Claw Of The Free Market"
PYT_invisible_claw_desc:0 "Many governments have preached the need for tight market regulations, ignorant of the tyranny implicit in such politics. Griffon behavior is economic behavior, and if we strangle the economy we strangle our people as well."
PYT_council_of_prelates:0 "Council Of Prelates"
PYT_council_of_prelates_desc:0 "The Holy Republic is not just a temporal power, but a spiritual one as well. To make sure that we remember this a council of our spiritual leaders shall come together to make sure that we guide the nation not just from political convenience but by moral necessity."
PYT_republican_constitution:0 "A Republican Constitution"
PYT_republican_constitution_desc:0 "The Rights of our citizens shall not rest in the mercy or charity of whatever leader is in charge at the moment. Instead, we shall tie our claws to a founding document that establishes our moral code and the rights of our people as worldly law. In a better world it would not be needed, but we will not take chances with our people's rights."
PYT_eyrs_blessing:0 "Eyr's Blessing"
PYT_eyrs_blessing_desc:0 "Greifenmarschen was in the beginning little more than farmers, to whom Arcturius and Boreas were more distant than Eyr, and we have not forgotten the importance of Her decrees. The Holy Republic shall not forget the farmer or the family, instead we shall make sure to never let go of these foundations of our society."
PYT_family_values:0 "Family Values"
PYT_family_values_desc:0 "In the family we have society in miniature, the present and the future both represented, and this matters. If we allow the families of our nation to fall apart we open the door to the dissolution of the nation as well. These bonds of Loyalty, Love and Care must be cherished, no matter how the family is structured."
PYT_welfare_checks:0 "Godly Education"
PYT_welfare_checks_desc:0 "The greatest crime of the Archons was that they made the understanding of the gods an oligarchy. We will choose another path, making the creeds of the gods avilable to everyone. In our society, even a common farmer should be able to stand up to and debate an Archon, should they ever rise again."
PYT_connect_the_countryside:0 "Connect The Countryside"
PYT_connect_the_countryside_desc:0 "The many small villages and towns throughout the countryside form the mortar holding the great house of the Holy Republic together, yet they languish in isolation all too often. We shall embark upon a great project to bind them all together. From the East to the West, we shall make sure that even the most isolated settlement is connected with the rest of the republic."
PYT_support_the_farmers:0 "Support The Farmers"
PYT_support_the_farmers_desc:0 "Though the world is changing, the foundation of any nation is and will always remain the farmer. One can trade to compensate for his absence, but trade can fail. When it does, the house missing its foundations will crumble in the storm."
PYT_the_sword_and_shield:0 "The Sword And Shield Of Arcturius"
PYT_the_sword_and_shield_desc:0 "The world is a harsh place, even for the virtuous. Be it by desperation or malice, others will always rise to challenge the rightous. This is what Arcturius taught us and this lesson will not be forgotten. Just laws or kindness will not turn away the hordes, steel and courage will."
PYT_forges_of_war:0 "The Forges Of War"
PYT_forges_of_war_desc:0 "The gods provide guidance in all things, including in crafting. Though the smithys have become industrial complexes, we still honor Arcturius as we craft the instruments needed to safeguard our liberty against whoever would threaten us. The Herzland can defend itself, it wants to defend itself and it shall defend itself."
PYT_sacrifice_for_greater_good:0 "Sacrifice For The Greater Good"
PYT_sacrifice_for_greater_good_desc:0 "For generations, the humble peasants of Greifenmarschen held onto their freedom through strength of arms, sharpness of mind and, above all else, a grim willingness to die for their lands and homes. Enemies may shatter our bodies but they cannot break our will, and coming beak-to-beak with warriors ready to die at a moment's notice will give them pause for thought."
PYT_herzland_paladins:0 "The Paladins Of Herzland"
PYT_herzland_paladins_desc:0 "From the heroes of the unification rises a new force of elite warriors; knights for a modern era. Shaped by the best training methods our military possesses and the most fervent ideals our faith can provide, we can give our champions the tools needed to truly fight for their people with a fervor that will make Arcturius himself proud."
PYT_religious_police:0 "Moral Police"
PYT_religious_police_desc:0 "The dissolution of a nation comes when it forgets what is good and just. In order to avoid this, we must empower carefully selected officers of the law to stand in the breach against not just lawbreakers, but the immoral as well. Acting on immorality before it elevates to criminality will not only strengthen the nation but deliver the lost among us before they cross the line."
PYT_enshrie_deities:0 "Enshrine Local Deities"
PYT_enshrie_deities_desc:0 "There are many gods beyond the Three, and though Boreas, Eyr and Arcturius rules supreme, we are not interested in enforcing them only. The Herzland is large, and many lesser deities hold sway here. All law-abiding griffons are welcome here, and we aren't going to treat their gods any differently."
PYT_make_ammends:0 "Make Amends With The Republicans"
PYT_make_ammends_desc:0 "The Republican revolt was a flawed answer to a question that needed to be answered, and though they only had part of the answer, they had one all the same and we must respect that. Diplomatic relations should be established with the remaining republican forces so that peace may hopefully reign between our two nations."

PYT_prince_of_heratlands:0 "The Principality Of Herzland"
PYT_prince_of_heratlands_desc:0 "The old tyrannical Empire has been toppled and its child-Emperor deposed. The storm has passed and a new bright dawn reveals a colourful rainbow above the Heartlands. We will follow Princess Celestia's hoofsteps and create a peaceful haven of griffonkind, filled with the magic of friendship and love. Our little griffons will finally live in harmony."
PYT_loyalty_eqs:0 "Loyalty"
PYT_loyalty_eqs_desc:0 "It is trust in each other that binds friends, citizens and even nations together. Never giving someone up, never letting someone down, never running around and deserting someone. This is the core of Loyalty; knowing that together we are stronger than alone."
PYT_expand_princely_guard:0 "Expand The Princely Guard"
PYT_expand_princely_guard_desc:0 "Princess Celestia can always rely on her Royal Guard to protect her life from any harm. Now that our Prince rules over all of Herzland, he not only has friends, but many enemies as well. By expanding his Princely Guard with many more loyal members, he will stay safe, and like the Equestrian ones our guard will stand by the side of our regular soldiers."
PYT_pony_foreign_legion:0 "The Pony Foreign Legion"
PYT_pony_foreign_legion_desc:0 "After our unification of the Heartlands, many Equestrian ponies have begun to eagerly support our regime. So eagerly, in fact, that they wish to contribute to our defense and aid us against our tyrannical enemies who wish to take away our liberty. Therefore Prince Archibald has decided to establish the Pony Foreign Legion, a dedicated army unit for ponies."
PYT_pony_invations:0 "Pony Innovations"
PYT_pony_invations_desc:0 "The industrial revolution began in Equestria, and many groundbreaking inventions were made there. Clearly, ponies are very creative folk, and we could benefit from scientific cooperation with them. The vast libraries of Canterlot may be open for us, and we will warmly welcome any pony scholars who wish to teach our young pupils."
PYT_mandatory_aptitude_tests:0 "Mandatory Aptitude Tests"
PYT_mandatory_aptitude_tests_desc:0 "When pony foals realize their true talent and passion in life, they receive cutie marks on their flanks to signify it. We griffons are unfortunately incapable of that. Or are we? Prince Archibald has mandated that every young griff has to take an aptitude test and discover what profession is their passion."
PYT_honesty:0 "Honesty"
PYT_honesty_desc:0 "Sometimes, it is tempting to avoid the truth and embrace the lie. But spreading falsehoods and rumours can never cause anything good, it can only bring ruin to friendships. We must remember this and see truth as something precious that must be protected. No one -- the Prince, his servants or the citizens -- should avoid the truth in fear of upsetting someone."
PYT_mend_the_divides:0 "Mend The Divides"
PYT_mend_the_divides_desc:0 "Not too long ago, many of us were enemies, fighting for rulership over all of Herzland. The wounds of war still haven't fully healed. But if we do not approach our enemies and be honest with each other, then will they ever heal? In the end, we should all stirve to be each others' friends, no matter if we're from Feathisia, Angriver or Bronzehill."
PYT_necessary_protection:0 "Necessary Protection"
PYT_necessary_protection_desc:0 "The truth is that we may not be able to avoid war indefinitely. Despite our love for peace, we must prepare for war, to defend our homes, families and friends. The sooner we accept this truth, the sooner we can begin preparations. Even Equestria couldn't avoid war forever, despite all their attempts at diplomacy and friendship."
PYT_connect_nation_3:0 "Connect The Principality"
PYT_connect_nation_3_desc:0 "Maintaining close contact to one another is hard if you are separated by hundreds of leagues. Unless you can travel on a train! Prince Archibald says we should follow Equestria's example and connect our towns with railways, no matter how isolated they are. Soon enough, the happy whistle of the Friendship Express will be heard across the land!"
PYT_generosity:0 "Generosity"
PYT_generosity_desc:0 "To give from oneself, to sacrifice one's own time and effort and wealth for others, is a sign of true love and caring. How can there be friendship if one refuses to share, or even takes from others? Generosity must be one of the founding pillars of our society. Only then can it be truly harmonic."
PYT_care_for_poor:0 "Give To The Poor"
PYT_care_for_poor_desc:0 "It is not just citizens who need to give to one another. The Prince and his state must be generous as well, instead of hoarding wealth in the treasury. We must help those less fortunate in our nation, and aid the poor wherever they are. Everygriffon in Herzland deserves a happy life, without destitution and the misery of poverty."
PYT_pensions_for_veterans:0 "Pensions For Veterans"
PYT_pensions_for_veterans_desc:0 "Many griffons fought bravely to reunite Herzland under the Prince, and some fought to resist him. No matter what side they fought on, their courage must be recognized and rewarded. Not only that, but we must offer then mental and physical healthcare, so they can recover from the horrors of war."
PYT_nocreature_left_behind:0 "Nocreature Left Behind"
PYT_nocreature_left_behind_desc:0 "There are more than just griffons living in Herzland. This nation is the home of many ponies and diamond dogs too, as well as small numbers of other races. Friendship knows no racial boundaries, and if anything our nation must be a beacon of interracial harmony. The downtrodden minorities of Herzland will never again face oppression, we will only give them love."
PYT_kindness:0 "Kindness"
PYT_kindness_desc:0 "The Heartlands are called such because it's in the heart of the Empire. But this name will receive another meaning: It will refer to the big hearts of our loving citizenry. Violence should be out of the question for our citizens, even if directed against non-sentient beings. We must be hospitable to visitors and loving to our families and friends."
PYT_protect_animals:0 "Found The Herzland Animal Protection Agency"
PYT_protect_animals_desc:0 "It is not enough to be kind to fellow citizens. Kindess should be extended to animals and other creatures as well, who can feel pain just like we can. Poaching, land clearance, hunting and more have drastically reduced the wildlife of Herzland over the centuries, and it is about time we intervene and save countless species from extinction. All lives matter, after all."
PYT_cut_it_down:0 "Some Things Simply Must Be Done"
PYT_cut_it_down_desc:0 "The beasts of Scheißwald have roamed freely and unchecked for far too long, wandering into settled areas and attacking helpess griffons. We must tame the forest and its inhabitants to prevent from more harm being done. We will take good care of the creatures in zoos and sanctuaries, where they can't possibly hurt anyone, and no one can hurt them."
PYT_sheisswald_national_park:0 "The Scheißwald National Park"
PYT_sheisswald_national_park_desc:0 "Many would call the creatures living in Scheißwald beasts or monsters, but they are just misunderstood animals. They mean no harm as long as they are left alone. Therefore we will found a national park where exploitation of nature is forbidden, so the creatures of the forest have their own space to live in. It's not like ponies disturb the Everfree Forest, either."
PYT_invite_pony_settlers:0 "Invite Pony Settlers"
PYT_invite_pony_settlers_desc:0 "Since we openly adopted Equestrian principles, many ponies in the west have expressed interest in doing business in our country, studying here or even permanently settling here. We shall tear down the barriers on immigration and citizenship, allowing anypony to come here and be embraced as a full member of society. We welcome our pony friends with joy!"
PYT_living_together:0 "Living Together"
PYT_living_together_desc:0 "Long has there been a common misconception that ponies and griffons naturally dislike each other. It is time we prove them false and create a harmonious society where these two races can live side by side in peace and order and work together. Friendship can bloom between any race, as long as assumptions and prejudices are thrown aside!"
PYT_laughter:0 "Laughter"
PYT_laughter_desc:0 "If you do not enjoy your life, then why would you live at all? Prince Archibald is determined to save his subjects from melancholy and apathy. While he can't force everyone to always be happy, he can make sure that life is enjoyable even to those who are unfortunate. The mental wellbeing and happiness of the citizenry should be one of the nation's primary concerns."
PYT_organise_festivals:0 "Organise Festivals"
PYT_organise_festivals_desc:0 "All work and no play can make anyone dull. Our workers should be allowed to relax every now and then, and enjoy communal celebrations together. Having more national holidays and regular festivals will bring much joy to our subjects, even if it will be expensive. Prince Archibald will spare no expense and will hire the best party experts on Equestria for help!"
PYT_jobs_for_everyone:0 "Jobs For All!"
PYT_jobs_for_everyone_desc:0 "Unemployment can easily cause depression, creating a sense of purposelessness and idleness. How can one be happy if they feel like a drain on society and cannot pursue their passion? The state must make sure everyone has satisfying work to do. The Prince is more than happy to pay for the wonderful products and services his subjects can provide."
PYT_religion_reforms:0 "Reform The Faith"
PYT_religion_reforms_desc:0 "It is clear the faith of the Three Temples cannot be left unchanged, if we want our society to be truly harmonious. Dogmatic faith and dominating clergy have no place in Herzland. Like in Equestria, faith should have far less importance, with the principles of friendship taking precedence. Something should also be done about those who see our Prince as a god incarnate..."
PYT_leash_archons:0 "Leash The Archons"
PYT_leash_archons_desc:0 "The power-hungry Archons brought nothing but turmoil to Herzland and the Empire. It is dangerous to give so much power to so few privileged individuals. Prince Archibald has always been an Old Believer, never believing in the manipulative lies of the Archons. While he knows that fully abolishing the Archonates would make many upset, he plans to greatly limit their power."
PYT_syncretic_faith:0 "Syncretise The Faith"
PYT_syncretic_faith_desc:0 "Equestrians have no need for priests in big hats to rule over them, and are content with their god-like Alicorn Princesses. Herzland, too, shall no longer have Archons plotting in the dark. Instead they will have the principles of friendship, alongside Boreas, the Sun God, Eyr, the Moon God, Arcturius, the Star God, and Archibald, the divine Prince."
PYT_magic:0 "Magic"
PYT_magic_desc:0 "When the other five principles of friendship come together, they create the final principle: Magic. It is difficult to understand for those who have not experienced the bliss of harmony and friendship, but our own people now fully know what it is. The unbreakable bond, the unquestionable love, the unshakeable camaraderie. All this is Magic manifesting in different ways."
PYT_harmony_and_unity:0 "Harmony And Unity"
PYT_harmony_and_unity_desc:0 "Herzland has become a very diverse nation of many races. Yet there is no conflict between them. Everyone is a friend, no matter what they look like or what they believe in. Peace prevails, even though sceptics predicted we would collapse into chaos. May we be forever united in friendship and love!"
PYT_an_ideal_society:0 "An ideal Society"
PYT_an_ideal_society_desc:0 "The levels of crime and violence in Herzland are now almost on par with those of Equestria. For most citizens, hurting or mistreating one another is an unthinkable, abhorrent act. Those who do commit such deeds aren't punished; instead, they are reformed and redeemed. No one is unjustly persecuted for their beliefs, and everyone is guaranteed their basic rights."
PYT_guardians_of_harmony:0 "Guardians Of Harmony"
PYT_guardians_of_harmony_desc:0 "Now that we have achieved harmony, we must do everything we can to protect it. Not only in Herzland or in Equestria, but elsewhere as well. We must remind the world that friendship does not make one weak. It makes one strong, strong enough to survive any storm of hatred and chaos. We will not falter, but bravely fight on in the name of harmony!"

PYT_united_at_last_2:0 "A Faithful Empire"
PYT_united_at_last_2_desc:0 "At last, the heretic filth lie vanquished and broken, and our superior forces stand triumphant over their miserable remains. We have clearly been blessed by Arcturius! Now it is time we get to work, and cleanse the decadent Empire of its impurities. Boreas wills it!"
PYT_abolish_the_archonates:0 "Abolish The Archonates"
PYT_abolish_the_archonates_desc:0 "They claim to be infallible and supreme over all other priests, yet they are but mortal fools. There was a time where griffons had no Archons, and it was a blessed time of freedom, without the oppression and temporal might of the cursed Archonates. This golden age shall now return!"
PYT_boreas_vengace:0 "Boreas' Vengeance"
PYT_boreas_vengace_desc:0 "Herzland is rotten to the core with scum and infidels. Many of them fought against us and rightfully perished, yet there are still those who survived, or who hid in the dark instead of opposing us openly. We must find these rats and bring them to justice. In the name of Boreas, our Lord, we must cleanse our nation and send the sinners to Tartarus!"
PYT_privatise_banks:0 "Privatise The Banks"
PYT_privatise_banks_desc:0 "Boreas decrees that wealth belongs to all who are worthy, not just the privileged few. The Zentralbank Griffoniens was an attempt by the Empire to go against this decree and ensure all wealth would ultimately be in the claws of the Emperor and his sycophants. We must reverse these efforts and privatize all previously state-owned banks in the Empire."
PYT_holy_corporatism:0 "Holy Corporatism"
PYT_holy_corporatism_desc:0 "To counter the challenge of radical trade unions inspired by socialism, the state must establish and support corporatist unions. Priests also support this effort and are willing to sponsor them. These sacred groups, whose members share common professions and labours, shall be the new organs of our society, individually contributing to the betterment of society."
PYT_advisory_prelates:0 "Advisory Prelates"
PYT_advisory_prelates_desc:0 "To guide our nation wisely and piously, our great leader Truthahn needs wise and pious priests to offer him their divine advice. The many prelates of Herzland are all volunteering to do so. They will also give a voice to the priests and citizens of the prelatures which they lead, and ensure no region is neglected in favour of the other."
PYT_all_power_to_leader:0 "All Power To The Leader"
PYT_all_power_to_leader_desc:0 "There is no doubt that Truthahn, the head of our nation, has been blessed by Boreas who entrusted him with power and the right to rule the Empire. To go against him, to doubt his words, to refuse his commands, all these heinous acts are sinful. The true herald of Boreas can do no wrong, and he will lead us to glory and eternal salvation!"
PYT_eyrs_family:0 "Eyr's Family"
PYT_eyrs_family_desc:0 "The recent wars have torn many families asunder, which surely makes Eyr weep. We must take action to make her happy once more, and repair the broken families of Herzland. The devastated countryside needs to recover as well, so our farms remain fertile and our harvests become plentiful once more."
PYT_children_quota:0 "Child Quotas"
PYT_children_quota_desc:0 "Every family must grow at least three children, for this is the only way we can ensure our population grows back to what it once was. Orphans will be adopted by same-gender couples, instead of remaining neglected on the streets. Families of the Empire must be reminded of their primary duty, for only then can our nation recover and grow."
PYT_limited_charity:0 "Limited Eleos"
PYT_limited_charity_desc:0 "Eleos is a concept of holy charity, and ensuring every griffon gets to fulfill their need for wealth. However, Truthahn has decreed that eleos is better reserved for those who deserve it: The best students, the finest scientists, the craftiest engineers. This will hopefully encourage our griffons to fulfill their potential."
PYT_intenstive_infrastructure:0 "Rural Infrastructure Projects"
PYT_intenstive_infrastructure_desc:0 "During the industrialisation of Herzland, the countryside was criminally neglected, with villages being abandoned as griffons moved to cities. We cannot forget our rural roots or sadden Eyr with our neglience. Instead, we must invest in building new roads, railways and bridges to revitalize the countryside."
PYT_expand_farmer_fund:0 "Expand The Bauernfond"
PYT_expand_farmer_fund_desc:0 "The Bauernfond, a state-owned fund used to support farm owners, has so far been limited to Greifenmarschen. It is time we extend it to all of the Empire! Land confiscated from the Archonates and the nobility will be granted to the poor and unemployed, and generous welfare will improve the lives of farmers."
PYT_arcturius_strength:0 "Arcturius' Strength"
PYT_arcturius_strength_desc:0 "It is known that we could not have won against insurmountable odds without the blessing of Arcturius. It is only thanks to him that we toppled the old order and purified the Empire! We must now pray to him, so we remain strong when we begin our crusades. If we Arcturius with us, who can be against us?"
PYT_forges_of_war_2:0 "The Forges Of War"
PYT_forges_of_war_2_desc:0 "We have seized countless armouries and manufactories from our enemies. All of these must be put to use at once to mass-produce arms and armaments for our holy army in preparation for the crusades. Yet even all this industrial might is not enough. For us to truly be strong, we need even more!"
PYT_sacrifice_for_the_nation:0 "Sacrifice For The Nation"
PYT_sacrifice_for_the_nation_desc:0 "Truthahn wishes to remind our people that Arcturius is not only the god of war, but also of sacrifice. To put yourself at risk, willing to die while defending your family and nation, is the most holy and noble act in the eyes of Arcturius. Such courage must be encouraged among our people, for sacrifice is necessary for our survival."
PYT_knights_of_the_old_faith:0 "Knights Of The Old Faith"
PYT_knights_of_the_old_faith_desc:0 "Many knights in Herzland are little more than puppets of the Archons. We have no use for them. But there are many Old Believers coming out of hiding who were previously persecuted. Some of them were rogue knights, who have now petitioned Truthahn to establish a new order reserved for them alone. Our leader is more than happy to do so!"
PYT_temple_militants:0 "Temple Militants"
PYT_temple_militants_desc:0 "The Bohngarde served its purpose, but it is time for it to be reformed to a less secular organization. Religious fanatics and zealots, all of them Old Believers, are eager to join the ranks of the militia and serve their fatherland. They will crush those heretical dissidents who wish for the Archonates to be re-established!"
PYT_empower_local_deities:0 "Empower Local Deities"
PYT_empower_local_deities_desc:0 "To secure their own interests, the three Archonates discriminated worshippers of lesser deities and advocated the exclusive worship of the Trinity alone. They did this for so long that many griffons have forgotten their old gods. The deities shall now be resurrected from oblivion and once again worshipped proudly in public!"
PYT_northern_war_2:0 "The Northern Crusade"
PYT_northern_war_2_desc:0 "The cold north is home to many traitors, chief among them being Kemerskai. But we must not forget the brutal raiders of Suntriker and the despicable communist scum of Skynavia. All of them have abandoned their gods to pursue earthly ambitions; it is even rumoured some have turned to worship Maar himself. This will not be tolerated! The north shall be cleansed!"
PYT_destroy_vedina_2:0 "Crush Vedina"
PYT_destroy_vedina_2_desc:0 "Vedina was never part of the Empire, acting only as a vassal. They dared to trick the blessed hero of Boreas himself, Grover I, with their lies and appeasements! Grover should have never listened to them, and simply destroyed their puny and poor kingdom with his sacred might. But there is no use lamenting the past. Let us now do what Grover I should've done!"
PYT_execute_kemerskai_2:0 "The Grand Traitor"
PYT_execute_kemerskai_2_desc:0 "Kemerskai and his band of atheist filth wished to turn the Empire into a secular state with his bandit and communist allies. They were righteously driven out, but were unfortunately left alive. Kemerskai has escaped justice for far too long. In the name of Boreas, we must punish him for his sins that destroyed the Empire!"
PYT_core_north_3:0 "Integrate The Northern Reaches"
PYT_core_north_3_desc:0 "The north may be sparsely populated and relatively underdeveloped, but this simply means the Empire must intervene directly to aid the locals. Loose governance is what allowed Cloudbury to fall and Vedina to stagnate. We will learn from the Emperors' mistakes and rule the north with a firm claw."
PYT_push_into_the_center_2:0 "The Shores Of Lake Rumare"

The day of mourning was finally held three weeks after the accident.\n\nProponents of industrialization and modernization now say the accident was the fault of the agrarian program which moved funds away from renovating vital railways and used them to build roads in the sparsely populated countryside.

Farmers organized a large protest in Oldwingburg which even threatened to burst into a riot. They claimed the proponents of industrialisation are favouring the urban areas too much and turning Greifenmarschen into a completely different nation.

As always, the peasants were eager to vote and gathered in large crowds across the country to choose their local leaders. In addition, each village sent a representative to Oldwingburg to elect the Statthalter, the symbolic leader of the nation who, despite lacking actual power, still commanded great respect.\n\n Out of the many candidates for the position of Statthalter, only four were likely to win the elections: old and ever-popular Erebus Whiteplume, nationalist and Herzlander supremacist Dietrich Mach, devout Equestrian immigrant Archibald Dawnfeather and communist reformer Wingbert Rohmer.

marschen.15.d:0 "The uncertain situation in Griffenheim seems to have finally ended and the underaged Emperor has a regent to rule in his stead. The regent in question is Archon Eros VII, a religious cleric who used populist rhetoric to gain the support of the common griffons and has in return granted them limited rights. However, Eros and his two companions Erion XII and Proteus III have only amassed more power to themselves and have shown no interest in creating any kind of democratic governing body.\n\nMost worryingly, the Archons have not made any statements regarding our independence and freedom. It is entirely possible they intend for it to end.\n\nA hectic emergency meeting of the council was held soon after the news arrived. The arguments lasted for hours, with council members getting exhausted in the end. Ultimately, it was for naught as no agreement was made on what should be done about the situation, leaving all factions frustrated. After several more days the Council finally decided that it might be wise to deny the legitimacy of the Archons' regency and hold a referendum about independence. Nothing else.\n\nErebus, Dietrich, Archibald and Wingbert all left the Temple of Boreas without saying a single word, newfound determination in their eyes. They all seemed to have realized that the democracy of Greifenmarschen is completely unable to cope with the crisis. How they plan to resolve this issue is anybody's guess."

Ultimately, it was for naught as no agreement was made on what should be done about the situation, leaving all factions frustrated. After several more days the council finally decided that it might be wise to deny the legitimacy of the Duchess' regency and hold a referendum about declaring independence.\n\nErebus, Dietrich, Archibald and Wingbert, tired of the squabbling, marched out of the Temple of Boreas without saying a single word, newfound determination in their eyes.

marschen.17.t:0 "Dawnfeather's Harmonist Intervention"
marschen.17.d:0 "Within months the popularity of Archibald Dawnfeather's young harmonist faction has skyrocketed, for it has promised to not only to maintain liberty but also peace, which the citizen-soldiers of Greifenmarschen appreciate as they can continue living their calm rural lives. Now that the regency crisis has proven too difficult for the deeply divided Council to oversome, Archibald Dawnfeather and the rest of GVHP have decided to intervene, trusting that majority of the common griffons will stand behind them.\n\nArchibald and other faction members arrived in front of the Temple of Boreas early in the morning and blocked the entrance by sitting in front of it, peacefully protesting the Council's lack of consensus. Other council members who came later were outraged, saying the harmonists were obstructing the democratic process. Archibald retorted that the Council had already been doing that because of their inner division and said they needed to settle their differences, speaking of the ancient Equestrian legend about Windigoes and how the leaders of the three tribes almost froze to death while arguing, only saved by their advisors finding common ground and befriending each other. He said the Temple would remain blocked until they did the same and apologized to their voters who they had completely failed with their lack of harmony and friendship.\n\nWhat followed was a violent fight as insulted and furious NAP, GKVP and KPG members attacked the harmonists and tried to force their way in. Nearby citizens were shocked and intervened, as did the Bauernmiliz soon after. Three griffons lied dead and dozens of griffons were arrested. Dietrich, Wingbert and Erebus were all put to prison to await trial while GVHP members licked their wounds and assumed control of the country. Archibald promised democracy would soon be reinstated after several necessary reforms had been made. He did not say anything about holding referendums to approve those reforms, but most of the populace trusted Archibald and his faction."
marschen.17.a:0 "For the People!"

marschen.18.t:0 "Rohmer's Communist Coup"
marschen.18.d:0 "As the economy of Greifenmarschen grows, so does inequality. In recent months this has resulted in constantly growing support for KPG, whose communist leader Wingbert Rohmer has promised to improve the lives of the unfortunate and downtrodden, dreaming to make Greifenmarschen a truly equal nation. In his eyes it is already proto-communist, and could become truly communist with only a few reforms. Reforms which he has been unable to propose because of opposition from other factions.\n\nWingbert knew that majority of the workers supported him now. It was time for change at last as the citizenry's faith in the Council was dropping. Now or never, he reasoned, and managed to persuade the rest of KPG to begin preparations for a revolution.\n\nThe sky shone bright red in the early morning as communist sympathisers, all armed, seized every public building and factory in Oldwingburg and arrested militiagriffs who did not wear signature red armbands, which showed allegiance to KPG. The coup was almost flawless, with only several gunfights breaking out resulting in a mere clawful of dead griffons.\n\nMembers of other factions in the Council gathered in front of the occupied Temple of Boreas, whose statue of the god had been defaced and which now had a red flag on its roof. Wingbert and his militia were there waiting for them. Before the enraged Council members could even ask what was happening, Wingbert held a speech condemning their actions and calling them traitors to the people. This made some members furious, especially the NAP deputy Wilke Truthahn who pulled out a gun from his pocket and aimed at Wingbert's head. Unfortunately Wingbert was faster and shot him in the leg, crippling him as communist militiagriffs seized him and arrested the other Council members. When Archibald, breaking down in tears, asked why they were being arrested, Wingbert calmly said he had already told them: They were guilty of betraying the common griffons of their nation who had voted for them in the first place.\n\nWhen concerned citizens asked KPG about the next elections, Wingbert bluntly said they would not be held and instead the country would be ruled by numerous workers' councils. Plebiscites were now a thing of the past."

marschen.19.t:0 "The Patriotic Putsch"
marschen.19.d:0 "Economic and social instability has plagued Herzland for decades now, and while Greifenmarschen has been relatively unaffected, griffons elsewhere languish in poverty and misery. Rising star Dietrich Mach has been holding passionate speeches about the liberation of their fellow Herzlanders and the unification of their divided fatherland. Meanwhile the veteran NAP deputy Wilke Truthahn has for decades now blamed the Archons for all the suffering in the Empire, claiming it was their plot to destroy it in the first place. His anti-clerical sect, the Old Believers, has been expanding rapidly, especially now that the Archons have become involved in the regency dispute. Both have been advocating aggression, which all three other factions are more hesitant about.\n\nIt was clear to both Dietrich and Wilke that simply holding fiery speeches wouldn't do anything. Now that the freedom of Greifenmarschen was threatened and Archons plotted in the shadows, it was time to strike immediately! They could no longer suffer the Council to stand in their way and doom their beloved homeland. The paramilitarist wing of NAP, the infamous Bohngarde, rallied behind them as they prepared to break the political deadlock with force.\n\nThe Council held a meeting as usual, but curiously not a single member of the NAP faction was present. An hour of political debate later they heard the echoes of a marching group outside. Soon the doors of the Temple were flung open and heavily armed militiagriffs burst inside, led by Dietrich and Wilke. They tried to speak but the Council was loudly panicking and protesting, so Wilke took out his gun and shot into the ceiling to silence them, then shouted that the national revolution had broken out and that no one was allowed to leave. Dietrich said in a more calm tone that the Council had been disbanded and the NAP would form the new government of Greifenmarschen. At gunpoint, Wilke demanded the former members of the council, now regular griffons, to swear eternal allegiance to NAP in the name of Boreas. Wingbert Rohmer spat on his face, smacked the pistol out of his grasp and tried to fly out of the building, but was stopped when a militiagriff shot him in the wing and grounded him. Whimpering and barely alive from the impact, he swore allegiance to NAP along with the rest of the council.\n\nDietrich held a speech in the center of Oldwingburg on the following day, promising to reinstate democracy once Greifenmarschen's independence was secured. Wilke added it would not be reinstated until the Archons were hanged."

marschen.20.d:0 "Erebus Whiteplume is a true veteran in the political scene of Greifenmarschen, having been active for over 40 years and holding the position of Statthalter countless times. Yet this experience only means he knows all the faults of the democracy of Greifenmarschen, especially after his travels abroad to countries such as Equestria and Sicameon. He can't help but admit that even despotic countries such as Brodfeld are run more efficiently than the political quagmire of Greifenmarschen, where constant referendums and elections are the norm. He still loves his country and its institutions like a father would love a disabled child, but his wishes to extensively reform the nation have so far been denied by the three other factions.\n\nNow, in perhaps the most dire time in his country's long history, changes are more necessary than ever yet remain undone. The harmonists, nationalists and communists all squabble in the Temple of Boreas, unable to even fully agree whether to support the Regent or what they should do if relations turn sour with the Empire. His old age has perhaps made him cranky, but nevertheless the GKVP, a faction that wouldn't even exist without him, supported him wholeheartedly when he proposed something radical: A coup.\n\nThe Council held a meeting as usual, with most members attending. Once again the arguments went nowhere as the factions failed to agree on anything. It was then that Erebus stood up. He began to speak and the building went silent at once, for everyone respected the old and wise griffon. In his speech, he told about how wonderful Greifenmarschen was, a unique nation in the world where the will of the people had the ultimate power. Then he sighed deeply and spoke of the flaws in the system, how completely impossible it was to pass reforms and how laughable the Council's response to the regency issue had been. He said change was needed, and it was needed now, and asked if the other members of the council could trust him and GKVP to do what they must. Many were hesitant, especially the leaders of the factions who all had their own plans of seizing power, but all agreed that Erebus was indeed right about the state of the country and GKVP, as agreed, enthusiastically showed support. Erebus swayed those who doubted by saying they needed to trust him if they wanted Greifenmarschen to survive, and if they wanted to resist him, they should remember that the citizens stood behind him and supported him. They wouldn't want to betray their own people, would they?\nAnd so dozens of Council members marched outside quietly and in good order, leaving Erebus and GKVP in charge of the country, for now."

Some wished to know how long this "while" lasted, but most agreed that the unstable situation in the Empire would need to be resolved before life could return back to normal.

It reported news around the globe like a normal newspaper, but also focused on events related to NAP such as meetings, speeches and rallies, always presenting them as rousing successes. The tone of the news was far, far away from objectivity and neutrality, with the text often digressing and ranting about the evil plots of nobles abroad, the suffering of fellow Herzlander peasants who live in slavery, the glorious past victories of Greifenmarsian peasants against "arrogant gentry scum" and the importance of the unification of Herzland under a "pure and free" Greifenmarsian regime."

He then continued, speaking of Greifenmarsian traditions and the wonder of its institutions, and how the griffons should rejoice that they are the most free people in the world. For the third time the crowd cheered.\n\n[Root.GetLeader] did not say that elections for Council members would not be held and that they would be instead appointed by him, and that he'd only choose NAP members who were utterly loyal to him."

When he considered to have enough popular support, he made his move.\n\nWilke woke up at his home to do his usual daily routines, which included checking the mailbox. What he found was a mysterious, unmarked letter. He opened it out of curiosity, only to discover to his horror that it was a mail bomb. In his mind he already prayed to Boreas, but the bomb did not explode. He sighed, both relieved and confused, and read what the actual letter said.\n\nIt was a warning. The bomb was intentionally made unable to explode. The message simply said that it would be wise for Wilke to resign as soon as possible and retire from politics, or he wouldn't be able to enjoy his retirement. Mostly because he'd be missing limbs."

marschen.25.d:0 "After receiving the threatening letter, Wilke abandoned his home and seemingly vanished, without officially resigning. Bohngarde militiagriffs have been searching the entire country, breaking into houses and interrogating and torturing dozens as they hunted the traitor. Dietrich, however, remained mostly unconcerned, confident that he had gathered enough support from NAP members.\n\nHe was wrong.\n\nAs the two leaders had argued and Dietrich had secretly been building up support, Wilke had been doing the same. The Old Believers were especially loyal to him and him alone, deeply hating Dietrich and his misguided decisions. As the Bohngarde searched for Wilke in vain, traitors among their ranks misguided them and ensured he would not be found. Soon enough the Temple of Boreas was barely protected, with most Bohngarde members engaged in extensive searches. That was when Wilke and his supporters struck.\n\nAs Dietrich was holding a speech to his fellow party members, sounds of explosions came from outside, followed by gunshots. The few guards were trying to defend the Temple from attackers coming from all sides and retreated inside, some of them wounded. Dietrich quickly realized what was happening and took out his pistol and urged the other NAP members to do the same.\n\nThe fight for the control of Greifenmarschen had begun."

The corpses of Dietrich and his fellow traitors that had been hanged in front of the building were rotting and the entire nation was holding its breath, waiting for what would happen now that the dictator was dead.\n\nWilke finally held a speech in the center of Oldwingburg and a large curious crowd gathered to listen. Truthahn held a fiery speech, condemning Dietrich and calling him an Archonite collaborator who planned to let Imperial armies occupy the country and annex it without a fight. He and his misguided followers had all been dealt with in the past week, and the sight in front of the Temple reminded everyone how Wilke dealt with traitors. He promised that a new age would begin in Greifenmarschen, with the faith of the Old Believers becoming the only official religion in the nation. Preparations would begin for a crusade against the Archon scum so Herzland would be liberated from the oppression of their depraved clique. It was the duty of the brave Greifenmarsian peasants to fight for the freedom and salvation of millions. Those who doubted they could do it, Wilke said, should remember that the Gods were on their side, and that faith alone could overcome all."

The conference took place in the newly constructed Temple of the Soviets, a purely secular building constructed in place of the demolished Temple of Boreas. Representatives from workers' councils (called "soviets" like in Stalliongrad, the beloved home of the revolution) across the country gathered there to create a new Greifenmarschen.\n\nDuring the meeting, agreements were made which turned KPG into a proper political party instead of a loose faction, with stricter membership requirements and more well-defined positions. In addition a new constitution was drafted and agreed upon, a Central Committee was elected and the country was officially renamed to Greifenmarschen Soviet Socialist Republic. Most importantly, bourgeoisie, priests and excessively wealthy peasants were stripped of their voting rights, which especially pleased Wingbert Rohmer, the General Secretary, who had dreamed of such change for years."

marschen.28.d:0 "To calm the populace and prevent a possible counter-revolution, Wingbert decided to hold a speech in the center of Oldwingburg. A large crowd gathered to listen to him.\n\nWingbert cleared his throat and begun to speak: "Fellow peasants and labourers of Greifenmarschen! I am well aware that the recent, sudden changes to the age-old status quo in our fair nation makes some of you concerned, perhaps even angry. But I assure you that this is a change for the better! Our country is already a country of the workers, the common griffons, for we have no cruel lord or greedy priest ruling over us. Yet recently threats have grown both without and within, the authoritarian Empire rising from the ashes and capitalists amassing wealth and power in this very city. Our system of direct democracy made us unable to make quick changes and decisions, and those are needed to respond to these looming dangers to our freedom and equality."\n\n"That is why we seized power. And now you may wonder and fear, will you now lose all your personal belongings? Friends, comrades, we communists are not thieves. We want to seize the means of production, the engines of wealth, and ensure their produce is spread fairly and no one uses it for their own personal gain. We want to preserve Greifenmarschen as a nation of you, the peasants, the common griffons. You have nothing to fear! We communists are your staunch allies who have your best interests in mind, not your enemies. So stop hesitating, and come greet the dawn and stand beside us!"\n\nKPG members in the crowd began to cheer loudly, and were soon joined by other griffons, drowning out any voices of dissent."

marschen.29.d:0 "Shortly after the revolution hundreds of business owners, industrialists and merchants wisely fled the country to Feathisia, Romau, Flowena or Yale. Those who remained either trusted the KPG to leave them alone after seizing their capital and means of production, or were too stubborn to leave their beloved homeland. Either way, they would regret staying.\n\nLast night a long-prepared operation organized by Wingbert took place. Armed KPG members stormed every home of the bourgeoisie, dragged out the filth and beat them before arresting them. Sometimes the traitors were shot on the spot as their families watched. A few tried to resist, which resulted in several injuries and even deaths of KPG members, only to be gunned down mercilessly.\n\nThose that remained alive were carried to "re-education camps", which according to Wingbert were "compassionate places of rehabilitation" where the inmates would receive "education, training and the opportunity to take part in clubs, sports and theatre groups."\n\nThe griffons who were sent to the camps would never return to their homes."

marschen.30.t:0 "The Ducal Restoration"
marschen.30.d:0 "Greifenmarschen was not always a democracy, as every citizen of the small nation knew. 200 years ago, the Duke of Greifenmarschen, Erebus, was removed by the peasants, and ever since that day the nation has remained an enduring beacon of democracy in Griffonia. But with the recent crisis sizing the small nation resulting in Erebus Whiteplume and the GKVP establishing a temporary dictatorship, Greifenmarschen once again rested under autocratic rule. Erebus was a veteran of the political landscape and his reputation for honesty and loyalty to the democratic traditions of Greifenmarschen made him a dictator that most of the factions could trust to see them through the crisis now facing the nation. And if he had ruled as he intended, it is possible that this would have resulted in Greifenmarschen enduring the crisis with its democratic traditions intact.\n\nBut fate had other plans for Erebus.\n\nIn the days after the coup, the old leader slowly grew more distant from his fellow members of the GKVP. He grew restless, each day appearing more tired than the last. His demeanor harshened considerably, and old friends now barely knew him. But this situation might have been avoided, were it not for the fall. While for any young griffon, a fall from such a height would not be very dangerous, Erebus was old, and it was a miracle that his body did not break. His mind, however, was a different story entirely.\n\nHe disappeared soon after, seeking the unmarked grave of the old duke, Erebus the first. Nobody truly knew what happened to him the days he was gone, but upon his return, it was evident that something had changed. After removing the few members of the GKVP who could pose a threat to his commands, he made an unusual request. A ducal crown made to be an exact replica of the old crown of the Duke. In the following days, the 200 years of democracy in the nation were over, and Erebus the second took the long-vacant throne of Griefenheim for himself."

He said they had to resist. The faction soon began to prepare a massive general strike in Oldwingburg which would weaken the economy and show the Duke that the common griffons opposed him and his takeover.\n\nErebus cared little for their complaints, and he knew how to deal with the dissidents.\n\nA mass protest began earlier today, with thousands of workers and peasants from all across the country refusing to work gathering in the capital. The crowd slowly made its way to the Temple of Boreas, vandalizing and burning buildings along the way. When they arrived, they realized they had walked into a trap.\n\nAll streets leading away from the Temple were blocked by soldiers. Sharpshooters appeared in windows in buildings around them. A machine gun had been set up in front of the statue of Boreas. There the Duke stood, his expression cold as stone, and gave the sign to his loyal troops.\n\nThe massacre began. None survived."

marschen.32.d:0 "The leaders of Nationale Aktionspartei were gathered in a discreet house in the countryside, far from the threat of the Duke's guard. Their topic of discussion was the duke himself, and how they would deal with the troublesome griffon. He had broken his old promises, and the leaders of the NAP knew that it was only a matter of time before they themselves were declared traitors to Griefenheim, and everyone knew the fate of traitors. They talked long into the night, discussing everything from a radical alliance with the KPG, to an immediate putsch with the military units still loyal to them.\n\nSo overtaken were they by their discussion that they failed to notice their guards outside stop reporting in, to notice the doors being sealed, the fire being set.\n\nWhen they finally realized what had happened, it was already too late, and the building was soon consumed in a raging inferno.\n\nWithout its leaders, the rest of NAP was unable to organize a resistance as soldiers were sent to arrest their members en masse. Thousands were imprisoned, deemed guilty of high treason and then sentenced to die. Mass graves near prison camps filled quickly and new ones had to be dug. Some execution squads complained of lack of ammunition and said they had to use bayonets instead.\n\nAnother obstacle against the Duke had been removed."

Archibald and the GVHP, along with sympathisers who wanted the democracy to be restored, had done nothing against the law yet, resisting without violence and plotting nothing. Their protests were calm and well-organized. The Duke, however, had a plan.\n\nDuring a peaceful, quiet night in Oldwingburg, the age-old Temple of Boreas suddenly caught fire. A massive storm of flames engulfed it and it soon collapsed. The following morning the news spread and the country was in shock. The Duke soon informed the populace that damning evidence had been found that proved GVHP members were behind the fire. This quickly turned a large part of the populace to the Duke's side, against GVHP. On the following day the Duke assumed Emergency powers, suspending many civil liberties. Archibald and his faction was accused of starting the fire and plotting a coup and were arrested en masse, without any protest from the citizens who had only some months ago loved democracy.\n\nPrison camps in Nortfome were quickly filled with tens of thousands of griffons. Thousands of them, including Archibald, would die in the squalid conditions. Some weeks after the fire, when the rubble of the Temple had been cleared, the construction of a new building began.\n\nThe Ducal Palace."

The flaws of the very core of the republic, the centerpiece which held the entire state together, had manifested themselves in the very worst ways possible. But these flaws had been present from the beginning of the peasant's republic, during its chaotic birth from a revolution against a tyrant. In many ways, the mistakes that the original founders made are understandable. A desire to avoid a tyrannical government and the lack of any real examples of such a republic created the original laws that still governed Greifenmarschen to this day.\n\nElections were to be frequent and referendums common, to avoid a malicious government sealing their hold upon the apparatus of the state. But in the end, these very safeguards slowly strangled the republic. Eventually resulting in the bitter stalemate that has paralyzed the republic for months now. And when it looked like the republic would fall victim to its own flawed creation, one of its oldest political players intervened.\n\nErebus seized power in an effort to finally fix the problems that so nearly sent the republic to its death. He is loyal to the republic, and the ideals that it stands for, and as such was willing to seize dictatorial powers to save it. Through a bold plan of reform, both created from his own thoughts and inspired by foreign democracies, he intends to fix the fatal flaws of Greifenmarschen. Only time will tell if he is successful.\n\nThe republic will be saved from itself."

Every province in Greifenmarschen is now made subordinate to the central state, with their privileges now drastically reduced. The central government will have final say on all matters that concern it in the provinces, and the autonomy of the provinces can now be freely modified at the command of the state. All provinces must follow the laws of Greifenmarschen, and no exceptions will be made.\n\nPerhaps we can finally get something done now."

It was, of course, a monarchy, so clearly democracy was not necessary to ensure happiness, well-being and wealth for all. Much to the shock of the audience he announced the dissolution of the Council and the formal end of the Peasants' Republic, albeit local municipalities would continue to be democratic just like in Equestria. From the ashes would rise a Principality, with Archibald as its Princess. A moment later he blushed and corrected himself, saying he'd be the Prince.\n\nSome griffons in the crowd grumbled but most did not protest, believing that a new golden age would begin in Greifenmarschen and that democracy was, indeed, unnecessary."

The line was extinguished. The treaty with the Emperors was no longer valid. The military had taken over, preparing for total war.\n\nGreifenmarschen was doomed.\n\nA hectic emergency meeting of the council was held soon after the news arrived. The arguments lasted for hours, with council members getting exhausted in the end. Ultimately, it was for naught as no agreement was made on what should be done about the situation, leaving all factions frustrated. After several more days the Council finally decided that it might be wise to deny the legitimacy of the military dictatorship. Nothing else.\n\nErebus, Dietrich, Archibald and Wingbert all left the Temple of Boreas without saying a single word, newfound determination in their eyes.

This, Wingbert said, was necessary to quell factionalism within the Union and prevent conflict, which in turn would enable the government to make decisions and remain united and strong. He also mentioned that his experience of his homeland's system of direct democracy, filled with obstructionism and endless debate, had inspired him to formulate these guidelines."

Many thought that the "wartime dictatorship" of the Union was no longer necessary and that Wingbert should be removed. Across all of Herzland, many disillusioned leftists denounced democratic centralism and joined the ranks of right-wingers who still opposed communist rule. And outside of Herzland, foreigners waited for the perfect opportunity to strike and sought to collaborate with local dissenters.\n\nWingbert knew something had to be done about this. Something... extreme, yet undoubtedly necessary, to destroy the countless enemies he saw in the shadows around him.\n\nSoon news spread that the head of the party organization in Griffenheim had been shot by an unknown assailant. Wingbert immediately used it as a pretext to execute his plans. Thousands were arrested and put on trial, both inside and outside the party. In following trials they were deemed guilty of various things: conspiring assassination of Wingbert, collaborating with nationalists and capitalists to betray the revolution and having secret meetings with foreign nationals, discussing plans to support them when they invaded Herzland. Many suspects admitted their crimes, their written confessions stained in blood, and begged for death sentences which were then granted. Thousands were shipped to labour camps in Scheißwald and gunshots echoed in the dark forests every night. Wingbert promised to leave the relatives of the guilty alone, then had them arrested and shot anyways. Revolutionaries, soldiers, priests, poets, artists, teachers, former landlords, peasants. All imprisoned or killed. Wingbert himself supposedly said "Who's going to remember all this riff-raff in ten or twenty years time?"\n\nAmong Greifenmarschen's communists who had once been Wingbert's allies and friends, the word "purge" used to mean simple reshuffling of the KPG membership.

The definition of leftism was clarified and it included a wide array of ideologies, even socialist monarchism and social democracy which Wingbert had denounced before. Already thousands of griffons have expressed their interest in joining the party.\n\nFor Wingbert, this was a pragmatic necessity. The only alternative to ensure the unity and stability of the UGSSR was too grim to even consider.

Even among the left the variety of ideologies was staggering, ranging from libertarian anarchism to totalitarian communism. Yet no matter what, everyone was allowed to become a candidate, and every single adult worker was allowed to vote. Soon enough all positions were filled and the newly elected committees got to work, their disparate members always trying to reach a consensus when making decisions.\n\nWingbert was pleased, as the commoners had been pacified and even his former enemies were happy with the current state of affairs.

Erebus Whiteplume, leader of Greifenmarschen's conservatives announced his retirement from politics, as stated by none other than himself. His health and age wouldn't allow him to carry on his duties efficiently. What this may mean for GKVP in the upcoming elections is a mystery, but one thing is clear: Erebus was a solid constant in political life of Greifenmarschen for a few decades, and his retirement will certainly shake up things as everyone was expecting he would be one to give this new Republic its look and character."

In their manifesto for upcoming elections, they vowed to achieve the goals of turning Herzland into a strong and united republic that will protect all its citizens, with firm yet just laws, and building Herzland into a strong economic hegemon in the region while not trampling all over the workers and protecting their rights.\n\nThey announced Werner Ebonplume, a long-standing member of the party, as their candidate in the upcoming elections. It is too soon to tell if he'll be able to lead the party towards victory or not. However, if rallies are any indications of their chances, it seems party was able to recover from the loss of Erebus and retain at least the main core of their voters. Werner himself, may not be a passionate speaker but his calm and dignified appearance and delivery certainly comes a long way with griffons in attendance."

They also advocate for free market without any major state interventions, leaving the market and businesses to regulate themselves.\n\nIt is hard to predict their chances for victory but they seem to be quickly gaining momentum. Many of their rallies are packed with griffons who support similar ideas.

They claim they oppose an idea of a centralized republic and stand for state autonomy. They promised a future where all states of the republic would continue to govern on their own. The central government would only have limited powers and could only intervene in certain issues, remaining mainly in representative function.\n\nThe rally showed us that despite his age, Moldernik hasn't lost any of his desire and remains a force to be reckoned with on political scene. It would be no surprise if his fiery and passionate speeches managed to secure his party a victory.\n\nNonetheless, their rallies are certainly geared towards specific demographics and much smaller in size compared to the opposition.

The main issue they seem to be concerned with is the legality of the trade unions in the Republic.\n\nTheir strike and manifesto were aimed towards raising the awareness amid this election cycle and pressing the candidates against the wall, demanding from them legalization of trade unions. They claim this will no doubt help with ensuring workers rights and safe working environments across the country. According to them, this can only benefit the state as in the long run it will ensure an increase in productivity of the workers. They ended with a threat that if their demands are not granted they will be forced to use the countrywide strike again."

These first nationwide elections would be most important as they will decide the future of the republic for decades to come. Everyone was fully conscious of this fact.\n\nPolling rooms opened at seven and first citizens were already waiting outside. Some elderly or less educated griffons needed help from polling officials with how to fill in the voting sheet. The entire morning was spent in a frenzy, at noon it calmed down a bit and first ballot boxes were sent to be counted. The second wave of citizens came in the afternoon, fortunately, there were much less of them compared to the morning. Polling rooms were closing at twenty and last ballot boxes were sent for counting.\n\nEveryone was awaiting the results of these elections with held breath. Who would win? Werner? Fiona or Anton? One candidate will feel immense joy after this night and the other two will have to wait for the next election cycle if they wish to try again."

marschen.55.d:0 "For far too long the Heartlands were linguistically and culturally disunified. Feathisians in the west, diamond dogs in the east. To unify Heartlanders as one and to prevent administrative problems stemming from lingual disunity, the government of Herzland decided to institute a policy of a single official language. All names, titles, documentation, textbooks etc. must be written in state language without debate.\n\nA dialect used around Griffenheim was chosen as the national language. As a reason, it was stated that former imperial capital was always a melting pot of cultures and the local dialect is already heavily influenced by nearby dialects. Language theorists will be tasked with doing further modifications to the grammar to make it as easy to learn for westerners and easterners. After that new textbooks can be printed and, if everything goes well, already in the next generation fruits of this decision should begin to show."

marschen.56.t:0 "The Protest"
marschen.56.d:0 "Some time passed since the unions quite strongly voiced their opinion, trying to press the electoral candidates to resolve the issue. Things calmed down once again and it almost seemed like everything might return to normal, as the government was working on fulfilling their campaign promises and restructure the new Republic. However, it was not meant to last.\n\nToday in the early morning, several thousand workers and trade unionists marched into the streets of major cities once more, declaring a second general strike. It is yet unclear what is the reason for this second strike. Perhaps they feel betrayed or disliked one of the recent governmental policies? Police was on the lookout the entire day, making sure the strikers wouldn't cause any trouble."

marschen.57.t:0 "National Confusion"
marschen.57.d:0 "It seems the government's attempts to implement a singular language for all of Herzland have been met with some confusion and perhaps opposition among the citizens, who do not understand its goal. The government naturally doesn't intend to back down.\n\nIt will, however, require more time and resources to than originally calculated to educate the citizens across Herzland about the goal and teach them language. No matter how long it takes Herzland must be culturally united and singular national language is the first and most important stepping stone towards this goal. Even if it takes years heartlands must stand united."

marschen.58.t:0 "The New Law Code"
marschen.58.d:0 "It is no secret that the old Empire was extremely decentralized for quite some time. Even if there was imperial law as an umbrella for all, each domain was governed by its laws made by often so very willful nobility. Both law codes were often clashing and it further weakened the imperial authority.\n\nEven now many regions still follow the laws they are used to. If the Republic is to survive and avoid the fate of Empire, it must sweep away the old law codes and write a one that is legally binding for all regions within it. The healthy and orderly law system is a sign of a strong nation after all."

marschen.59.t:0 "The Language Act"
marschen.59.d:0 "Heartlands are a linguistically disunified area. Even after several centuries, the imperial dialect wasn't able to spread to Feathisia and other surrounding regions, while the diamond dogs use both the imperial dialect and their own, strange language. While there is no doubt the Republic needs an official language that would be used in case of formal documentation and international talks, it would be immoral to suppress other languages.\n\nIn the end, after some fierce debate in the cabinet it was decided that Griffenheim dialect would become the basis for the official state language, while in areas of the west and Bronzehill, local languages would be allowed to be used dually. This means that every child has to study two compulsory languages, but it should be worth the effort."

marschen.60.d:0 "The cultural differences between the regions of the Republic are too large. Every state has its own traditions when it comes to religious worship and believes in different deities besides the main three. It would be tyrannical if a griff from Scheißwald were to decide religious policy up in Bronzehill. This is why the central government cannot be allowed to interfere in matters of religion. As such government has granted each state full powers to decide and regulate religious worship as they see fit.\n\nGiving away power to states and letting them decide will ensure equal standing among states and happiness of the citizens whose traditions won't be disrupted. Furthermore, it will ensure separation of secular powers and church powers and ensure that nogriffs like archons will ever be able to gain power over the people."

marschen.61.d:0 "For a while now the leadership of other parties has pressured the government to decide about the issue of the state language. The government of Herzland has now announced a surprising decision. From now on, there will be no one language serving as the official national language. Instead, the government chose to give up this power to individual states. Regional administration will be able to use its local languages as they see fit within the borders of their state. While the opposition is warning against confusion that will be created by this decision, the government seems to be firm on the issue and it is unlikely they'll change their minds."

It wasn't easy as the young republic had to face many challenges when it was forming, such as union strikes, elections, the formation of the government, passing of the policies and so forth, but the main bulk of work is done now. The Republic is stronger than ever, the citizens are proud to call themselves Heartlanders, despite many differences that may still divide them. The economy is on the rise and it is only a matter of time Herzland becomes one of the most prosperous nations on the continent, if not the world. The army is steadily growing in numbers too, and each soldier is ready to fight for the fatherland if necessary.\n\nAnd it is not a moment too soon, for there are still nations who would readily attack if given a chance. Herzland must be vigilant and it cannot fall asleep on its laurels just yet. All heartlanders must fight against tyrants, autocrats and injustice in Griffonia and secure freedom and democracy in their beloved homeland. Herzland must remain strong and steadfast in its convictions and march into the future with pride. "

marschen.64.d:0 "After months of campaigning Erebus's dreams have been realized. The imperial capital was at last within his claws. He achieved what his namesake could never do. He was now truly the Emperor. Upon his arrival at the imperial city, he immediately gave an order to prepare everything for his coronation, an important act to secure his power. After all, he wasn't about to let anyone take the throne from him. It was his and only his, by right of conquest.\n\nFour days later, the day of coronation arrived. Griffons were flocking to the imperial palace, nobles, merchants, clergy and peasants alike, for all were allowed in. Erebus' personal guard was in charge of security and inspected every entrant. The throne room was steadily getting packed until it was completely full. Above the throne were hanging the imperial flag and the flag of Greifenmarschen. All portraits depicting members of Grover's bloodline had been removed and replaced with ones of Erebus'. Front rows were occupied by loyal members of the new regime. Some were wondering if the former child Emperor would be present as well.\n\nFinally, the sound of bells could be heard from the outside. Everyone fell silent expecting the ceremony to begin. Some in the back rows were craning their necks trying to see better. At last, the door into the throne room opened. There he was, Erebus, once but a humble griffon from the equally humble border region, now about to become Emperor. He was wearing rich brocade robe sporting imperial colours. There were oohs and ahhs, muttering and even some cheers accompanying his walk towards the throne. His face was stern and unreadable. Finally, he reached the throne. He stopped in front of it and turned towards the assembled crowd. As scheduled one of his close aides stepped forth. He was carrying a very expensive looking pillow with the imperial crown in it. He stepped over to Erebus and was supposed to put a crown on his head as rehearsed. However, at that moment, Erebus reached for the crown. His claws grabbed it firmly. He raised it over his head and put the crown down. His aide quickly recovered and as Erebus lowered the crown on top of his head, he shouted: "I present you his imperial majesty, Emperor Erebus I.!" At this, Erebus simply sat down into his new throne. A faint smile of satisfaction creeping into his face as he was listening to the crowd chanting his name."
marschen.64.a:0 "Long live the Emperor!"

marschen.65.t:0 "An Imperial Adoption"
marschen.65.d:0 "Erebus was sitting in his office going over the documents. He decided to take a break. These days it was happening more and more often. It was a clear sign that he is no longer the spring chick he once was. His age was catching up with him. However, he wasn't about to let his death destroy everything he achieved so far. His Empire, his dreams, they must live on even if he'll be no longer alive. That way his legacy will live on forever. He looked over the shoulder toward the desk. All the necessary documents were laying on top of it. He checked if everything is in order this afternoon, all they needed was his seal and signature. A satisfied smile returned to his face as he looked out of the window, and saw Grover VI reading a book in the courtyard. Indeed, the young son of Grover V was still in his custody. He is of the prestigious and noble bloodline. However, what is more important, he is still young. Yes, he can shape Grover into the perfect heir worthy of continuing his legacy. Like a doll.\n\nErebus smirked. He continued to watch the world outside for several more minutes before he returning to his desk. One more time he looked at the documents and then grabbed for wax that was waiting at the side of the table. He poured vax at the paper and before it could harden he reached for his seal. The Seal was showing proud two-headed griffon holding a sword in one claw and imperial apple in the other. He pressed the seal against the wax and set it aside. One more signature next to the wax. Finally, with documents signed, the adoption became official. From now on Grover would be his son and rightful heir."

marschen.68.t:0 "Anti-Temple Laws"
marschen.68.d:0 "In the past the temples were allowed to do whatever they wanted outside the imperial authority. The Archons even rivaled the Emperor in influence! This dichotomy of power can no longer be tolerated. By Erebus' imperial decree, the temples and the priests have been stripped of any political power. Further, they are forbidden to accumulate any more wealth than is necessary to keep the temples in a good state. All excess wealth and income shall be sent to the Emperor. From now on Emperor or officials acting in his name will be the ones to assign new priests and prelates. The office of Archon will be abolished and instead, the temples will respond to a civilian administration.\n\nIt will surely take some time to implement properly but we must not falter. There can be no other authority allowed to exist. The imperial rule must be absolute and control over the temples will allow us to pacify any dissent in the population much easier while destroying our greatest foe."

marschen.69.d:0 "It is no surprise to find out that all recent troubles in Griffonia were caused by the rise of republicanism and communism. They only give rise to anarchy and demagogy. We must destroy their malignant influence and strengthen the Emperor's authority.\n\nThat is why by imperial decree, all political parties are hereby disbanded. Anyone caught agitating for them can be marked as a traitor to the nation and treated as such. All former members of these parties have forty-eight hours to leave the nation, and if they don't do as such force may be applied. All political rallies must be approved by the appropriate administration and political speech that can be a threat to the regime will be censored. All student and recreational organization established by these parties will be transferred under the jurisdiction of the ministry of education and it will be their decision what to do with these organizations. As an addendum, all newspapers must be authorized by the censors and their content may be screened for treasonous messaging. There is no doubt this will help us build a stronger and unified Empire."

marschen.70.t:0 "Rewriting The History Books"
marschen.70.d:0 "Best way to secure our power is to reform the education system. It is currently irrevocably tied to the old regime. The books are written from their perspective. We cannot allow our young to be taught from such books, lest they might grow to despise us.\n\nHence by imperial decree, we task the ministry of education with a complete restructuring of the educational system, as well as writing new textbooks. To shake citizen's trust in the old regime is to strike at the myth of Grover's bloodline. Yes, we must show them Grover and his descendants from the new light. Show them the truth behind the myth, even if we have to make up some facts. Although, that should not be necessary. Grover I was no saint after all.\n\nWe will also redeem the reputation of our Emperor's predecessor, Duke Erebus I. For centuries the imperial history books have painted him as a cruel tyrant who deserved to be overthrown. We will prove that all this was lies and propaganda, and that he was as benevolent as Emperor Erebus. Once we succeed in this task our authority will be unquestioned and love of the citizens will be ours forever."

marschen.71.d:0 "Is it time? Kemerskai wondered to himself when a jailer opened his cell. He had enough time to think these past few weeks. Was it his mistakes that led to his loss and imprisonment? He thought back on his life a lot now. It is not like he could do much of anything else in here. The jailer didn't answer he ordered him to stand against the wall of the cell. The old griffon did as ordered. There was no point in resisting now. [Root.GetNameDef] had won. Just how many soldiers had died back there? For the Republic and for the faint lure of freedom.\n\nThe jailer chained him and ordered him to get out of the cell. He was being led through the corridors, and could see a few familiar faces in the cells. It was his failure that caused them to end up in here. He wanted to apologize to them for failing them, but his throat was parched and he could only make faint croaks. Outside the prison, a cart was already waiting for him. He was forced to take a seat.\n\nThe cart took him through the streets of Griffenheim, where citizens watched him pass by. Some were jeering at him, others were laughing. All of a sudden a rotten tomato landed in his face. He looked for who did it. It didn't take long. It was a young griff. Couldn't be older than six. He didn't fault the boy, he was just a child, raised by a corrupt oppressive system. Yet another soul that he had failed. Just how many children will suffer under this regime? His heart trembled in shame.\n\nThe cart stopped at the central square. The crowd here was even larger. There were tribunes prepared for richer citizens, as if this was entertainment. In the middle of the square where the statue of Grover I used to stand was a stage. A noose was there, waiting for him menacingly. He was led towards it.\n\nThe executioner set the noose around his neck. Kemerskai took one more look at the crowd. Jeering and thirst for blood were still in the air. He looked towards the tribunes. Griffons in much nicer clothes were sitting there. They weren't jeering. In the middle, he could see much bigger tribune; only a single griffon was sitting there. Kemerskai's stomach would force out everything if he was given any food. To think his death would be entertainment for [Root.GetLeader].\n\nThe executioner stepped closer. His claw was touching a lever. And then the floor under gave away. In his last moments, he thought about all that died for his dream. Slowly, his consciousness faded away..."

marschen.72.t:0 "The Awakening"
marschen.72.d:0 "Erebus sat down on his throne in Griffenheim's Imperial Palace, and sighed deeply. It was done. All of griffonkind was now under his rule. His Empire spanned across most of Griffonia and even reached Equus. He had crushed countless foes and gained numerous victories. History would remember him as the superior reincarnation of Grover I, his predecessor's sworn enemy. Then, he looked upon a map depicting the breadth of his domain and wept, for there were no more worlds to conquer.\n\nBut as he did so, something... stirred in the back of his head. Something he had forgotten awakened. Slowly but surely, it pushed forth into the center of his mind, bringing light into the murky darkness.\n\nErebus stood up and gasped. He looked around the empty hall nervously. With shaking claws, he reached for his crown and looked at it in terror.\n\nHe threw it away in sheer disgust.\n\nErebus was back. Not the Duke, or the Emperor. Erebus the Old, a Greifenmarsian peasant and a popular council leader. And he had much work to do.\n\nAll autocratic reforms were reverted. Oppressive laws were cancelled by an Imperial decree. A draft of a new constitution was made. His lackeys were kicked out of the palace and preparations for Pan-Griffonian democratic elections began.\n\nAll citizens reacted with shock and surprise, and eventually joy. Their cruel master had come back to his senses and released them from their shackles. All of Griffonia could at last breathe free and fly like birds in the sky.\n\nBut for Erebus, this was the end. He left the nation he had made on self-imposed exile, sailing on a ship to distant lands. He would never return to his dear marshes and farms of Greifenmarschen. He would die alone, a hermit, to atone for his sins. But when he passed away, he smiled, for he had created a free Griffonia united under democracy, which would hopefully last many generations."

The Archons' authority is no more and their riches have been seized to benefit the nation instead. The now former Archons have each been encouraged to take up roles that would more sincerely show their devotion to the people and the Republic has been more than willing to help them find such a position.\n\nIt is a telling sign none of them were interested."

We are not weak and we are not unprepared.

The old empire was corrupt and tyrannical and it would have to fall sooner or later. We aren't going to claim that Kemerskai's revolution was a force of pure good, but neither are we going to dismiss it. There has already been enough blooshed in the Herzland and it is time to end it.

marschen.78.t:0 "The Principle of Loyalty"
marschen.78.d:0 ""Dear Princess Twilight,\n\nOutside of Griffonia, many joke that griffons are only loyal to one thing: gold. But this couldn't be further from the truth. While fighting to save Herzland from evil, I saw just how loyal my brave griffon soldiers were. The wealth offered to them for their service was small, but that did not deter them or temper their spirits. Instead, they were eager to sacrifice themselves for the greater good of others, to put themselves in danger to protect their friends and family. Griffons are no less loyal to one another than ponies.\n\nOf course, there is one remarkable difference between us griffons and ponies. Our strong belief in various gods. I have noticed that even griffons who aren't loyal to others, can still be loyal to their chosen deity. They do not want to ever anger them or disappoint them, and closely follow their commandments. This loyalty is among the strongest ones a griffon can have, and I believe it should be nurtured in moderation. As long as such loyalty to gods is not abused by Archons who claim to represent those gods, I see it only as a good thing.\n\nI will now seek to put what I have learned into practice. I hope you will be proud of what I accomplish as a Prince.\n\nYour faithful student,\n\nArchibald Dawnfeather""

marschen.79.t:0 "The Principle of Honesty"
marschen.79.d:0 ""Dear Princess Twilight,\n\nAfter ruling a nation for several years, I quickly learned that lies are very tempting. You wish to maintain your image as a flawless, infallible ruler, to show the positive accomplishments of your governance while hiding the negative aspects of it. Tremendous amounts of wealth pass by your claws, from taxes, fines, salaries, tribute and so forth, that sometimes it is even tempting to seize some in secret and pretend you never did so.\n\nThis is why I believe honesty is among the hardest principles to follow. Avoiding the truth is so often simply the better option, it seems, even if it is morally questionable. Yet such thinking is short-sighted. Lies are, almost without exception, revealed eventually. The truth which you tried to hide away is boldly unveiled, and because you avoided it so long, you do not know what to do with it. The bad deeds of your past are never truly forgotten, resurfacing even after years.\n\nThis is why the key to being honest is to be long-sighted. Truth pays off in time, while treachery and deceit will always be something you come to regret, even if they initially seem superior. As long as we keep this in mind, the temptation of lying is powerless against us.\n\nYour faithful student,\n\nArchibald Dawnfeather""

marschen.80.t:0 "The Principle of Generosity"
marschen.80.d:0 ""Dear Princess Twilight,\n\nAmong the most prevailing stereotypes about griffons in the world is that we are naturally greedy. And while it is true that we have the largest banking establishments in the world, and a tendency to hoard wealth accrued over the years, this doesn't mean that griffons are incapable of generosity as well. Eleos is a primary example of this: A holy act of giving away some of one's own wealth to those who have little, so they too can satisfy their desire for acquiring things. One could argue that new ideologies such as socialism take this age-old practice to a whole new level, guaranteeing that every griffon in society gets to fulfill their needs, so everyone is equally prosperous.\n\nIf griffons were purely greedy, then they would be selfish as well. Therefore I believe that as long as griffons genuinely care for each other, they are willing to share while still retaining this innate dragon-like desire for wealth. Thus, friendship makes even griffons generous, and generosity makes griffons friendly to each other.\n\nI believe this cycle can be started and reinforced by the state itself, meaning that welfare shall be one of my primary priorities. I am sure you agree that this is right.\n\nYour faithful student,\n\nArchibald Dawnfeather""
marschen.80.a:0 "Giving is caring."

marschen.81.t:0 "The Principle of Kindness"
marschen.81.d:0 ""Dear Princess Twilight,\n\nGriffons are often seen as inherently rude and disrespectful, and "kind griffon" is almost seen as an oxymoron. This conception has some truth to it. After all, the land of the griffons has been fractured and torn by wars for a long time, and economic issues have made us value survival over virtues.\nYet it must be said that griffons are not inherently mean. Neither is it true that griffons are only nice when they get money. All it takes for a griffon to be kind is to receive kindness from others, and then they are willing to give kindess in return. This is how bonds of friendship are formed; by mutual respect, and reciprocal acts of caring.\n\nSo to begin this cycle, one must be the first to act kind. It may take a surprising amount of courage and effort, as it is often easier to just not care about others, but it is ultimately worth it. And when you realize that kindness almost always receives kindess in return, you will no longer be discouraged to be kind. The sooner the people realize this, the better it will be for all of society. Therefore, the state should leave by example, and be kind to its citizens.\n\nYour faithful student,\n\nArchibald Dawnfeather""

marschen.82.t:0 "The Principle of Laughter"
marschen.82.d:0 ""Dear Princess Twilight,\n\nWith the economic and political turmoil following the revolutions of 978 and 980, rates of suicide in Griffonia skyrocketed. Many griffons lost all hope and were overwhelmed by misery in their lives, and chose to end it all instead of continuing to suffer. They cannot be blamed for their acts. Instead, we must ask how that can be avoided in the future, and how griffons can find happiness in their lives.\n\nThis is why the principle of laughter is far more important than it may seem. Suffering and negativity in life can never be avoided, so they must be balanced with joy and positivity. It is hard to be positive with yourself when you are negative, but far easier to provide positivity to others. This is why friendship is important, as we all need others to support us and improve our mood when it is downcast.\n\nWhat is the role of the state in all this? Well, the state has the ability to organize public events such as festivals, and to provide mental healthcare which for now is in its infancy in much of the world. Public holidays, when everycreature is free from work, can greatly improve the morale of the citizens and allow them to spend time with friends and family, who in turn make them even happier. While it may be expensive, happiness of citizenry is worth any price.\n\nYour faithful student,\n\nArchibald Dawnfeather""

marschen.83.d:0 ""Dear Princess Twilight,\n\nWhen all five principles, loyalty, honesty, generosity, kindness and laughter, are closely followed, friendship will bloom amongst all. This is when the final and most powerful principle is revealed: Magic. It has no clear or strict definition, but generally refers to friendship being able to overcome unsurmountable odds, and to provide euphoric bliss for those who achieve close friendship with someone.\n\nMagic is indeed hard to accomplish, but this makes it all the more extraordinary. It means that achieving it on a national scale is not far from genuinely utopian, with all its citizens sharing close-knit bonds of trust and compassion. Some would say it is altogether impossible, and that most citizens are unable to have such relationships, but I sincerely believe that through concentrated effort, friendship on a national scale can eventually be accomplished, thus creating a real and tangible utopia. And I am certain we are not far from doing just that.\n\nYour faithful student,\n\nArchibald Dawnfeather""
marschen.83.a:0 "Friendship is magic!"

marschen.84.t:0 "Guardians Of Harmony"
marschen.84.d:0 "The central square in Griffenheim, the grand capital of Herzland, filled to the brim with griffons as they gathered to hear their benevolent Prince's speech. Beyond the city, families turned on their radios and tuned to the national broadcast channel, so they could hear the speech as well, no matter how far away they were.\n\nPrince Archibald appeared on a podium and greeted his loyal subjects, who cheered and praised his name. Then they went completely silent as he began to speak.\n"My dear friends, before I talk of the matter at claw, allow me to first remind you all just how much the quality of life has improved for all citizens of Herzland in recent years. I do not speak of material wealth alone, of course, but of mental wellbeing and happiness. This has been achieved because friendship is the very foundation of our society, like in Equestria. Without friendship, none of this could have been achieved."\n\n"This is why I must now talk to you about the state of the world beyond our borders. We cannot completely isolate ourselves and ignore our neighbours, or the lands further away, especially if they threaten our nation. We can never allow a malicious outside force to destroy everything we have worked so hard to create! Not only that, but we cannot simply stand by and watch foreign tyrants and despots oppress others. I do not call for war or violence, but I am saying that we must be prepared to do anything in order to preserve harmony in this world. Neither am I making vague statements, but telling you of what actions must be taken now, not later."\n\n"But never forget, my subjects, no matter what happens, you will always have your friends by your side, and with them you can overcome any challenge. Together, and only together, we will safeguard the magic of friendship and defeat evil that wishes to destroy it!"\n\nThe crowd applauded and once more began to cheer, chanting Archibald's name."
marschen.84.a:0 "Harmony must be fought for!"

marschen.85.t:0 "The End Of The Archonates"
marschen.85.d:0 "Any Archons in Herzland had fled the region as soon as Truthahn and his followers triumphed over their enemies. Now, all that remained were the empty Grand Temples, the headquarters of the Archonates of Boreas and Eyr. The former was in Griffenheim, the latter in Romau, and the Grand Temple of Arcturius was outside of Herzland entirely. But it too would be taken care of eventually, Truthahn thought. For now, it was time to create a new order in Herzland itself.\n\nThe Grand Temples were closed from visitors, and barriers were set up around them. Many wondered what was going to happen, if they were going to be repurposed or redecorated. They had already been looted bare of valuables, for the Old Believers were ascetic and humble, seeing the richly adorned temples as an anathema to their faith. But the fate of the buildings would be far worse.\n\nToday, Truthahn announced that he would hold a speech in front of the Grand Temple of Boreas, and reveal the changes that would come. A large and curious crowd gathered to listen, with some zealous Old Believers among them, and a microphone had been set up at the podium so all citizens of the Empire could hear him speak.\n\n"My faithful brothers and sisters! Today is an extraordinary day, for it marks the beginning of a grand new era of rebirth and reformation. All of Herzland, all of Griffonia, will eventually be cleansed of corruption, decadence and sin. The first act of this age will be the complete erasure of the Archonates! Many falsely believe that they were always part of our faith, but the truth is that they were established centuries ago by greedy and power-hungry prelates who wished to dominate their fellows. The three Archons then proceeded to suppress other gods, who were not part of the trinity they represented. Those who dared to oppose them were oppressed, murdered and hounded. The so-called Old Believers were forced into hiding until recently."\n\n"I am one of them, and my ancestors shall now finally be avenged. We no longer hide in fear, we are no longer oppressed, we are no longer seen as heretics. We are finally in power, and we shall at last cast down the unholy Archonates that insult the gods with their existence! All traces of this corruption will be erased, starting from the Grand Temples themselves. Boreas wills it!"\n\nAs soon as Truthahn ended his speech, he raised a clenched fist into the air, and suddenly explosions were set off in the temple behind him, tearing it asunder. The ornate building, burning and smoking, soon came violently crashing down. The Grand Temple of Eyr in Romau met a similar fate at almost the exact same moment."
marschen.85.a:0 "Good riddance."

marschen.86.t:0 "Boreas' Vengeance"
marschen.86.d:0 "During the latter years of the reign of the Groverian dynasty, Herzland became corrupted and filled to the brim with tyrants, communists, republicans and worse. The revolution of 978 allowed the despots to gain ever more power at the expense of the Empire, while the revolutionary scum was forced into hiding, to wage ceaseless guerilla warfare costing countless lives.\n\nNow, their reign of terror has ended, and it is time they receive their punishment for their vile and treacherous acts. Truthahn ordered all guilty imprisoned griffons to be brought into the central square in Griffenheim, where they would meet their fates. Nobles and radicals alike sat side by side in heavily escorted trucks as they rolled into the Imperial Capital. The former foes were silent, their heads hung low in fear and shame. Their struggle had torn Herzland asunder decades ago, but it had all been for nought.\n\nThe trucks were emptied and rows upon rows of prisoners were marched out, all wearing ascetic clothes. Their backgrounds could not have been more different, but now they were all the same. Truthahn was there to meet them, and he looked at them in disgust.\n\n"I have a feeling that some of you fools think we are being unjust, that you don't deserve to be imprisoned and punished, and that you only did what had to be done. But with your warmongering, rebellion, extortion and sabotage, you committed treason not only against the Empire, but against Boreas as well! Did Boreas not decree that lessers should respect their superiors?"\n"You are nothing but an upstart peasant!" shouted a baron from Strawberry. "The pot calling the kettle back. Get back to tend your crops!"\nTruthahn pulled out his pistol and shot him dead. The other prisoners gasped and remained silent. "I am only doing this because the gods above have ordained me with a sacred task of saving the Empire and purging the sinners. Can you justify your deeds like I can? I don't think so."\n\nOne of the prison guards stepped forth and asked: "Leader, what shall be done to them?"\nTruthahn glanced at the terrified faces of the prisoners, their eyes pleading for mercy.\n"Kill them all, Boreas will know His own."\nThe guard nodded, and motioned his comrades to escort the prisoners to the execution site."
marschen.86.a:0 "Boreas, guide our claws!"

marschen.87.t:0 "Eyr's Family"
marschen.87.d:0 "In the name of Eyr, Truthahn decided to start a campaign promoting family values and helping the farmers. It would be a grand beginning of a wider program, dedicated to preserving Eyrite values in the Empire. Not only that, but Truthahn would use it to prove to all that he was benevolent to those who were loyal to him.\n\nHe started by visiting an orphanage in Griffenheim, where he met many children whose parents had lost their lives during the recent wars. He said that every child deserved to be raised by a family, and promised to all the orphans that he would guarantee their adoption in the future. As an act of good will, he also donated several hundred toys to the orphanage.\n\nThen, he travelled to his homeland of Greifenmarschen, and toured its many rural villages. He promised a tractor for every farmstead and said economic development would not come at the expense of the countryside. To show that he had not forgotten his rural roots, he helped farmers in person with farmwork, despite his old age. The farmers appreciated all this greatly and said they will vote for Truthahn when he one day restores democracy like he had promised.\n\nAs a final act of this journey which state propaganda had covered extensively, Truthahn went to visit his relatives in Oldwingburg. While his daughter's reception was cold as ice, his grandchildren were more open, and eagerly listened to the old griff tell stories of mythical heroes who fulfilled quests given to them by Boreas, Eyr and Arcturius.\n\nThe campaign proved to be a great success, with Truthahn's popularity rising. Most importantly, everyone was certain that Eyr herself was pleased with Truthahn's deeds, and looked forward to what he would do in the future."
marschen.87.a:0 "Eyr, protect us!"

marschen.88.t:0 "Arcturius' Strength"
marschen.88.d:0 "Despite the new Imperial Army being but a shadow of its predecessor and consisting primarily of Greifenmarsian militia, Truthahn was still determined to hold a military parade. To not do so would surely anger Arcturius, the god of war, and that was out of the question. To make up for their low numbers, the soldiers would march with looted equipment, even ones they did not know how to use such as tanks.\n\nThe preparations took several weeks, but finally the day of the parade came and the streets of Griffenheim were closed from civilian traffic. A large audience gathered, consisting of citizens from all over Herzland, to witness this grand celebration of Truthahn's triumph. The parade began with a column of Bohngarde militiagriffs carrying banners and standards of the defeated foe and throwing them on the ground before Truthahn's podium. Then, the army orchestra started playing and soldiers began to march through the streets, headed for the central square. They no longer wore rugged militia clothes, but Imperial uniforms, and carried the finest weapons from the spoils of war. They were followed by trucks, artillery and tanks, the last of which struggled to stay in formation due to inexperience of the drivers. Finally, hundreds of guards escorted a large group of prisoners of war from defeated nations, consisting of humiliated Feathisians, humbled Diamond Dogs, gloomy Angriverians and so on.\n\nThe units gathered in the central square, took off their headwear and prayed to Arcturius along with Truthahn. When the last word had been uttered, roaring planes flew over the center of the capital, and the audience cheered, impressed by the might of the military."

### Ruler descriptions ###
PYT_erebus_desc:0 "Erebus is an old griffon who has been active in the political scene of Greifenmarschen for around 40 years. He has held the office of Statthalter dozens of times but has gotten tired of Greifenmarsian democracy. Due to his longevity, experience and personal travels he's come to realise that their system is extremely inefficient compared to most other countries in the world. While he does respect the democratic traditions of the country he thinks they need to be bureaucratized and rationalized."
PYT_dietrich_desc:0 "Dietrich is a young militiagriff who has quickly risen to prominence among the ranks of NAP, becoming its unofficial leader thanks to his charisma and reasonable yet passionate speeches. He is a Herzlander supremacist, believing that all of Herzland must be united under one banner, with force if necessary."
PYT_archibald_desc:0 "Archibald was not born on Greifenmarsian soil, but still has Greifenmarsian blood in his veins. His family migrated to Equestria many years ago but his father ensured his son inherited both his love of their true homeland and his Old Believer faith. Eventually Archibald emigrated to Greifenmarschen and soon joined the GVHP, wishing to spread Equestrian values of harmony and friendship among his people. Despite being only in his mid-twenties, his enthusiasm and flowery promises of change have already made him very popular, but his reputation is marred by rumours that he enjoys writing fictional stories about a secret incestual relationship between the Equestrian Princesses."
PYT_wingbert_desc:0 "Wingbert is a die-hard communist, believing Greifenmarschen to be a proto-communist nation whose democracy is threatened by capitalism. He believes that it is his duty to improve the lives of his people and ensure true communism is finally embraced."
PYT_duke_desc:0 "Erebus has proclaimed himself to be the rightful Duke of Greifenheim, a title that has been gone for about two centuries. He has lost all faith in democracy and intends to crush any opposition to his despotic reign."
PYT_protestant_loonie_desc:0 "Wilke Truthahn, the former deputy of NAP and the current supreme leader of Greifenmarschen, is a clerical fascist and a member of the religious sect known as Old Believers. He strongly believes that the Archons must be overthrown and the Archonates dismantled, for every griffon can talk to the Gods without the aid of geezers wearing silly clothes."
PYT_literally_stalin_desc:0 "Having become the supreme leader of Herzland, Wingbert now wishes to ensure the state remains unified and strong, free from counter-revolutionary ideas and internal dissent. But at what cost? He seems not to care, and neither do his followers who grow increasingly fanatical..."

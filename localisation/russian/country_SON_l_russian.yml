SON_zonni_zolon:0 "Зонни Золон"
SON_zonni_desc:0 "Зонни Золон — отпрыск мелкого аристократического рода, который никогда не пользовался особым влиянием в Зар-Хэйе. За годы мазвийского правления семья заработала дурную славу сотрудничества с угнетателями, а отец Зонни даже женился на мазвийской кобыле. Зонни взвалил на себя это бремя позора на всю жизнь и сделал всё возможное, чтобы доказать, что он — настоящая зебра Зар-Хэй. Зонни Золон созвал недовольных воинов и поднял восстание против мазвийского владычества, как только пришло известие о победе Короля Шторма на юге. Он проявил себя проницательным стратегом и выбил мазвийский гарнизон с минимальными потерями. После этого простой народ провозгласил его героем, но вожди племён продолжали относиться к нему с недоверием. Казалось, Зонни должен был сделать больше, чтобы завоевать их уважение, но он принял титул регента и намерен поднять племя своё к величию. После того как он победит всех врагов Зар-Хэйя, возможно, род Зонни будет наконец искуплен."

SON_nyaberi_zargey:0 "Найбери Зарги"

SON_azkhai_desc:0 "Все живые члены династии Зугхе, которая правила Зар-Хэем с незапамятных времён, держалась в заложниках в Зиани несколько поколений. Им давали спокойно жить в хороших условиях в обмен на запрет покидать столицу Империи Мазви. Поэтому ещё с юности Азхай жил в небольшом мирке, ограниченным хорошо охраняемыми стенами собственного дома.\n\nНо всё изменилось с появлением Короля Шторма.\n\nК тому времени Азхай вырос мудрым и зрелым жеребцом, желающим сбежать из золотой клетки и вернуться на родину. Когда Зиани запылал, он увидел в этом ту самую возможность. Стены его дома остались без охраны, чем жеребец и воспользовался, сбежав вместе со своей семьёй через горящий город, в котором мародёрствовали йети. После этого он с помощью Юзегора из рода Алвани, которого тоже держали в заложниках, смог сбежать в сельскую местность и затеряться. Тем самым Азхай вместе с семьёй вырвался в большой мир, ведя их всех в безопасное убежище в Ре-эме, где щедро принимали всех беженцев из рушащейся империи.\n\nКогда его родные обрели дом на новом месте, Азхай приготовился вернуться в Зар-Хэй и по праву выдвинуть претензию на  пустующий трон. Однако жеребец прознал об амбициях регента, который был мазвийским полукровкой, и понял, что тому нельзя доверять. Так что законный наследник изменил свои планы. Избрав более осторожный подход, Азхай решил продолжить скрывать свою личность, попутно набирая поддержку солдат и обычных зебр. Постепенно он стал готов раскрыть себя и принять свою истинную судьбу."
SON_nyaberi_desc:0 "Найбери родилась в семье торговцев, поэтому её дальнейшая судьба была предопределена в соответствии с традициями Зар-Хэя. И она очень быстро поняла, что именно из-за презренного (по меркам кастовой системы Зар-Хэя) происхождения, другие зебры смотрят на неё свысока. Когда она достаточно выросла, чтобы отправляться на собственные торговые маршруты, то путешествовала всё дальше и дальше от своей репрессивной и традиционалистской родины.\n\nНайбери неизбежно довелось посетить места, которые были гораздо более технологически и социально развиты. Она увидела поразительные чудеса современности, высокие здания и скоростные автомобили. Здесь она также узнала об экзотических политических идеях, которых ещё не существовало на её отсталой родине. Это вдохновило зебру на создание собственной радикальной идеологии.\n\nКак только она вернулась домой, то сразу же начала налаживать контакты и использовать прибыль от торговли для создания лояльного ей внутреннего революционного движения. Так или иначе, но Найбери осуществит свои фантазии об утопии, свободной от глупых традиций и иерархий."

Используя само государство в качестве инструмента своей воли, Найбери принудительно модернизировала все Великие Озёра. А затем избавилась от него, когда государство исчерпало всю свою полезность. И теперь её мечты воплотились в реальность.\n\nОбщество во главе которого стоят торговцы. Общество, где каждый может стать богатым."
SON_dongo_desc:0 "Когда-то Занда Донго был не более чем обычным крестьянином. Его семья владела небольшим участком земли, которого было достаточно, чтобы зарабатывать на жизнь. И с раннего детства всем казалось, что он просто унаследует ферму и продолжит дело семьи, когда станет старше. Однако с возрастом у него развился буйный характер, да такой, что он нередко срывался на всех вокруг. Он часто на пустом месте выходил из себя и проявлял жестокость. Очень быстро его семья устала от выходок и решила выгнать зебру. Теперь, оставшись совершенно одиноким, Занда Донго потерянно бродил по дорогам сельской местности, ввязываясь в драки со случайными незнакомцами. Однако одна из них внезапно оказалась воином армии Зар-Хэя, и её очень впечатлила свирепость Донго. Она порекомендовала Занду своему командиру, который принял зебру в ряды своей роты. Тому не потребовалось много времени, чтобы стать сильным и храбрым бойцом, который вымещал весь свой внутренний гнев на врагах. Поднимаясь по служебной лестнице, Занда неизбежно в один день стал генералом имперской армии."
SON_zuwa_meynsata_desc:0 "С годами Мейнсата стала правым копытом Зонни, консультируя его во всех важных вопросах и помогая на поле боя. Поэтому неудивительно, что она стала преемницей Золона. Совершенно неожиданно для себя. В первую очередь Мейнсата воительница, а не правительница, поэтому сейчас кобыла чувствует неуверенность в том, а готова ли она принять мантию Зувы. Только время покажет, сможет ли зебра сохранить Имперское Царство Зар-Хэй непоколебимым."

SON_famed_griot:0 "Фасса Баллеке"
SON_famed_griot_desc:0 "Когда-то семья Баллеке служила королям и королевам Зар-Хэя в качестве придворных трубадуров-гриотов, но после оккупации державы силами Мазви семейство было вынуждено отправиться в изгнание и стать странствующими артистами. Младшая представительница этого рода, Фасса Баллеке, ныне вернулась на родину, чтобы снова служить при дворе. Она умело играет на моло и выучила наизусть важнейшие мифы и исторические предания Зар-Хэя. Кобыла оказалась весьма популярной исполнительницей, так что простые зебры нередко собираются у дворца, чтобы послушать её выступления."
SON_chief_quaggo:0 "Вождь Квагго"
SON_chief_quaggo_desc:0 "Квагго – самый видный вождь Заирбанда. Корни его семьи вызывают уважение собственным почтенным возрастом. Несмотря на свою глубоко укоренившуюся ненависть к иноземным владыкам, они относительно успешно пережили правление Мазви. Хотя за прошедшие годы семья потеряла большую часть богатств и власти, их престиж по-прежнему высок, и поэтому голос Квагго более важен, чем голоса большинства прочих вождей. Сам он известен своим параноидальным отношением к чужеземцам и особенно не доверяет регенту Зонни Золону, который наполовину является мазвийцем. Квагго с нетерпением ждёт возвращения законного чистокровного короля на трон Зар-Хэя."
SON_chieftess_amzina:0 "Предводительница Амзина"
SON_chieftess_amzina_desc:0 "Семья Амзины родом из племени Анзонго. В последнее время они поднялись из грязи в князи благодаря продуманной торговой политике, которая принесла им великое процветание. В отличие от более консервативных племён, которые застряли в прошлом, Амзина и её родственники приняли перемены и быстро адаптировались. Теперь в Анзонго, некогда сельской провинции, процветает ранняя промышленность, за что в основном стоит благодарить сотрудничество с местным ре-эмским меньшинством. Амзина следит за тем, чтобы торговый путь по Нейлу оставался безопасным. Для этого её военные каноэ патрулируют воды реки и взимают с купцов приносящую немалую прибыль пошлину за эту охрану."
SON_chief_faran:0 "Вождь Фаран"
SON_chief_faran_desc:0 "Вождь Фаран из Зарабара – сын могущественного волшебника, который пошёл по стопам своего родителя. Хотя племя жеребца довольно бедно, его почитают как искусного зельевара и мастера магических искусств. О самом Фаране мало что известно, поскольку жеребец предпочитает, чтобы о нём узнавали по его поступкам, а не словам. Гремучая смесь страха и уважения делает Фарана очень влиятельным зеброй в Зар-Хэе."
SON_reemite_advisor:0 "Янив Литжол"
SON_general_zanda:0 "Занда Донго"
SON_ndebi_political:0 "Фари Ндеби"
SON_ndebi_political_desc:0 "Ндеби занимал пост фари, командующего королевской армией Зар-Хэя, и также являлся одним из лидеров восстания против мазвийцев. К сожалению, его достижения затмил Зонни Золон, которому и достались все заслуги за "спасение" Зар-Хэя. Несмотря на недовольство такой интерпретацией фактов, Ндеби по-прежнему готов добросовестно выполнять свои обязанности. Он – убелённый сединами ветеран, который ранее служил в армии Имперского Мазви, но дезертировал после разгрома этого войска Королём Штормом."

SON_chieftess_meynsata:0 "Предводительница Мейнсата"
SON_meynsata_full_name:0 "Мейнсата Нияма"
SON_chieftess_meynsata_desc:0 "Большая часть  Зар-Хэя счиает племя Зибиридугу весьма странным из-за их кардинально отличающейся культуры и причудливого диалекта. Тем не менее, они с жаром отстаивают своё право быть гордыми подданными Зар-Хэя, будучи неотъемлемой частью королевства на протяжении веков, вплоть до возвышения империи Мазви. Хотя Мазви напрямую аннексировал их, отделив эти земли от Зар-Хая, предводительница Мейнсата возглавила сопротивление, чтобы изгнать гарнизон оккупантов и воссоединиться с королевством. Мейнсата снискала славу умелой воительницы, сразившей своим копьём множество врагов. Зонни Золон особенно уважает её именно за эти способности."
SON_captain_zaghe:0 "Кан-фари Задж"
SON_captain_zaghe_desc:0 "Задж – кан-фари, глава королевской гвардии, ответственный за безопасность короля. Когда монарх отсутствует, обязанностью этого поста является охрана регента. Задж отлично знает о позоре своих предшественников в прошлом, которые не смогли спасти правящую династию Зар-Хэя от превращения в заложников Мазви, и полон решимости искупить запятнанную честь своей должности."
SON_chief_monzon:0 "Бага-Тархан Монзон"
SON_chief_monzon_desc:0 "До возвышения Зекуриса, лжепророка, отец Монзона был Бага-Тарханом Масигены, местным правителем, служившим мазвийскому Манзе. Он пытался остановить подстрекательские действия Зекуриса, но это привело лишь к крупному восстанию, закончившемуся его смертью. Его сыну Монзону удалось бежать и организовать небольшое движение по сопротивлению против разъярённых фанатиков. Когда Зонни Золон привел свои армии в Масигену, Монзон приветствовал их как освободителей и делал всё возможное для помощи им, надеясь, что таким образом сможет восстановить контроль над землями своего отца. И действительно его надежды оправдались. Теперь он готов служить королевству... однако его верность крайне сомнительна, поскольку Монзон всё же предпочёл бы быть независимым, суверенным правителем, а не всего лишь подданным."
SON_zogon:0 "Инструктор Зогон"
SON_zogon_desc:0 "Суровый зебра, но лишь настолько, насколько это необходимо. Зогона боятся простые солдаты и уважают командиры. Как бывший рабовладелец он обладает богатым опытом приведения непослушных зебр в форму. Зонни увидел в его навыках невероятную пользу, поэтому предложил зебре должность в своей армии."

SON_foreign_advisor:0 "Нью Модел"
SON_foreign_advisor_desc:0 "Нью Модел – это земная пони из Эквестрии, которая когда-то служила в королевской страже. Она всегда стремилась к реформам и улучшению вооружённых сил своей родины, однако очень быстро на собственном опыте узнала, с каким скрипом в Эквестрии проходят любые радикальные перемены. Все её предложения об изменениях в армии были отклонены, что крайне разочаровало пони. Вскоре она уволилась из стражи и начала путешествовать по миру, предлагая свои услуги в качестве военной советницы. Возможно, другие страны смогут осознать ценность реформ в век стремительного технологического развития."

Теперь, будучи свободным зеброй, он зарабатывал на жизнь в качестве уборщика в библиотеке университета. Работая там, ему довелось встретить доброго учёного, который научил его читать, ведь сам Забери показал себя умелым учеником. Довольно скоро его повысили до ассистента, проводившего большую часть своего времени за чтением книг, в особенности политических, в которых так или иначе пропагандировалось создание эгалитарного общества. В конце концов Забери стал одержим работами Карамели Маркс и Файр Энджела, которые предрекали неизбежность мировой коммунистической революции.\n\nПосле того как Зар-Хэй завоевал Тимбакту, он сбежал из города в ужасе перед своими бывшими поработителями. Забери скрывался в сельской местности, выполняя иногда попадающуюся работу и таская с собой огромную коллекцию позаимствованных книг. В конце концов он встретил Найбери Зарги, торговку, которая хотела создать собственное радикальное революционное движение. Он решил помочь ей и вскоре стал правым копытом Найбери. Забери остаётся довольно ортодоксальным коммунистом, который верит, что образование расширит возможности масс и создаст по-настоящему равноправное общество. Когда разразилась революция, он был повышен до генерала не за обладание какими-либо военными навыками, а потому что был пламенным оратором, который знал, как повести за собой других."

За время его отсутствия она получила высококачественное ре-эмское образование и наглядно показала всем, что обладает острым умом. К тому времени, когда семья Зугхе вернулась в Зао, Харакой выросла в уверенную в себе кобылу, пусть ей и недоставало амбиций других её родственников, которые жаждали заполучить трон. Вместо этого она решила набраться терпения, зная, что в конце концов её очередь неминуемо настанет, а дух-хранитель Харакой Диззо, в честь которого зебра носит имя, защитит от любых угроз. К тому же, отец всегда будет на её стороне, король он или нет. "

Но Мазви увидел это процветание и возжелал захватить его, вторгнувшись в это королевство, убив его королеву и взяв в заложники её жеребят. Почти два столетия спустя Мазви подвергся наказанию богов, которое осуществил злой Король Шторм. Однако широко распространено мнение, что королевская семья Зар-Хея погибла в хаосе. Некогда мы надеялись на триумфальное возвращение наших давно потерянных правителей, но этого так и не случилось. Трон остается пустым, и никто не осмеливается захватить его, опасаясь, что мстительные призраки династии Зугхе проклянут их."

### Foci ###

SON_summon_the_chiefs:0 "Созвать вождей"
SON_summon_the_chiefs_desc:0 "У Зонни грандиозные планы на будущее, но для их исполнения ему нужна поддержка вождей племён Зар-Хэя, ведь только благодаря ней возможно реализовать все амбиции. Однако далеко не все они верны Золони, а некоторые даже не признают его законным регентом! Созвав вождей в Зао, он сможет закрепить легитимность своего правления."
SON_gather_the_griots:0 "Созвать гриотов"
SON_gather_the_griots_desc:0 "Гриоты, уважаемые историки, поэты и музыканты Великих Озёр, традиционно записывали и сохраняли деяния королей и королев и воспевали те в своих песнях. Зонни может воспользоваться их помощью, чтобы увеличить свою поддержку среди простых зебр... но сначала нужно убедить их относиться к регенту как к древнему королю."
SON_divine_the_future:0 "Предсказать будущее"
SON_divine_the_future_desc:0 "Как же Зонни может начать военные походы без благословения бога и духов? А если жрецы и вовсе предскажут неудачу, то вся  кампания изначально будет лишена малейшего шанса на успех. Поэтому Зонни заранее должен поговорить с святыми зебрами. Ведь если сам Отче-Небо против этих походов, то у него нет надежды на победу."
SON_fire_the_forges:0 "Вооружить воинов"
SON_fire_the_forges_desc:0 "Король Шторм сметал своих жалких врагов невиданным ранее во всём Зар-Хэе оружием. Мир стоит перед новой эпохой глобальных войн, и наша страна должна уметь быстро адаптироваться, если хочет одержать победу в своих. К счастью, учитывая, насколько сейчас нестабильна Зебрика, приобрести новейшее оружие относительно легко, если знать нужных зебр."
SON_protector_of_reemites:0 "Защитник ре-эмцев"
SON_protector_of_reemites_desc:0 "Ре-эмцы – это лошади со странной религией, жившие долгое время по соседству с Зар-Хэем. Они ценят мир и прогресс, поэтому их города такие процветающие. Однако эти лошади часто подвергаются гонениям из-за своей веры. Зонни понимает их пользу в качестве союзника, и у него есть одна интересная идея..."
SON_an_offering_to_spirits:0 "Подношения духам"
SON_an_offering_to_spirits_desc:0 "Помимо Великого Жеребца, верховного бога небес и земли, в Зар-Хэе также почитаются множество младших богов. Если Зонни хочет, чтобы его военные походы увенчались успехом, ему нужно заручиться поддержкой жрецов, особенно тех, кто чтит духов, связанных с войной. Для этого регент выберет достойное подношение."
SON_beat_drums_war:0 "Ударить в барабаны войны"
SON_beat_drums_war_desc:0 "Для успешных завоеваний Зонни нужно больше воинов. Поэтому свободные зебры королевства должны быть мобилизованы, а ополчения собраны. Этого уже не делали много лет, но Золони позаботиться о том, чтобы всё прошло гладко."
SON_rebuild_the_fleet:0 "Восстановить флот"
SON_rebuild_the_fleet_desc:0 "Во время восстания против оккупантов-Мазви, Зонни использовал боевые каноэ с ошеломляющим успехом, добившись освобождения Зао дерзкой атакой с озера. Теперь, он приказал расширить действующий флот Зар-Хэя, дабы вернуть ему утраченную славу. Заргитау бы им гордился, ведь именно он создал и активно использовал каноэ против своих врагов."
SON_cast_down_false_prophet:0 "Низвергнуть лжепророка"
SON_cast_down_false_prophet_desc:0 "В Масигене злой дух вселился в зебру, который начал проповедовать еретическую ложь другим. Он собрал поразительно много последователей и теперь хочет навязать свои порочные идеалы другим племенам Великих Озёр. Этого нельзя допустить! Зонни провозгласил правление самозваного пророка незаконным, тем самым получив повод вторгнуться в Масигену."
SON_mercy_for_warriors:0 "Помиловать воинов"
SON_mercy_for_warriors_desc:0 "Некоторые из тех, кто сражался за лжепророка, были отнюдь не фанатиками, ослеплёнными верой, а обычными воинами, которые были верны своим племенам. Эти зебры просто выполняли свой долг, и Зонни уважает их боевые навыки. Поэтому он предложит пощадить их, если те принесут клятву верности ему и только ему."
SON_burn_the_zealots:0 "Сжечь фанатиков"
SON_burn_the_zealots_desc:0 "Тот, кто сбил зебр с пути истинного, был схвачен вместе со своими самыми верными последователями. Теперь с ними разберутся и накажут за их ересь. Без своего лидера безумные культисты не смогут самоорганизоваться, и их дело окончательно рухнет. Так они больше не должны никому угрожать."
SON_religious_freedom:0 "Свобода веры"
SON_religious_freedom_desc:0 "Догматики принуждали всех зебр Масигены исповедовать только одну религию, преследуя и наказывая всех, кто отказывался это делать. Теперь, когда их диктатуре обмана и лжи пришёл конец, Зонни объявил, что все зебры вольны почитать любых богов каким угодно способом, не боясь при этом за свою свободу и жизнь."
SON_governor_of_macigena:0 "Восстановить власть Тарканов"
SON_governor_of_macigena_desc:0 "Настало время интегрировать племена Масигены в королевство Зар-Хэй. Они более чем заслужили стать его частью, поэтому Зонни решил полностью восстановить власть и авторитет Тарканов, которых ранее преследовали безумные фанатики. В ответ на этот жест они принесут клятву верности престолу Зар-Хэя, признав регента законным правителем."
SON_the_fallen_kingdom:0 "Павшее королевство"
SON_the_fallen_kingdom_desc:0 "На севере король Алвани попытался восстановить своё разрушенное королевство после конца оккупации Мазви, но город Тимбакту бросил ему вызов и отказался преклонить колено. Некогда великое королевство теперь лишь жалкая тень от прежнего величия, поэтому сокрушить его не составит труда. А контроль над богатым Тимбакту принесёт процветание Зар-Хэю."
SON_city_of_misguided:0 "Город заблудших учёных"
SON_city_of_misguided_desc:0 "Интеллектуалы и торговцы Тимбакту бросили вызов вернувшемуся из изгнания королю Алвани, а теперь они могут также отрицать власть Зар-Хэя, несмотря своё поражение. Традиции гласят, что они должны признать своего законного повелителя, однако те рьяно стремятся нарушать священные уклады общества. Так пусть же они столкнутся с последствиями."
SON_fate_of_the_king:0 "Судьба короля"
SON_fate_of_the_king_desc:0 "Когда воины вошли в Алвани, им удалось захватить короля Юзегора. Монарх пытался восстановить своё королевство, но потерпел неудачу. Теперь он опозорен и бессилен, а Зонни должен решить, достоин ли король сохранить свою жизнь или его следует казнить, чтобы окончательно сломить дух оставшихся сторонников."
SON_desert_tribes:0 "Завербовать воинов пустыни"
SON_desert_tribes_desc:0 "Армию короля Юзегора поддерживали дикари из Зубийской пустыни, однако Зонни очень быстро зауважал их боевые навыки. Пусть они и были лояльны королю, но после его поражения ситуация изменилась. Их можно убедить сражаться за нового хозяина и научить их навыкам воинов армии Зар-Хэя."
SON_governor_of_north:0 "Назначить Зубиа-Фарму"
SON_governor_of_north_desc:0 "Земли бывшего королевства Алвани слишком обширны, чтобы ими можно было управлять напрямую, а просто подчинить местных вождей – задача не из лёгких. Многие остаются верны бывшему королю, а в Тимбакту всегда была своя форма правления. Поэтому необходимо создать новый титул для зебры, которая будет управлять севером от имени королевства Зар-Хэй."
SON_subjugate_south:0 "Подчинить юг"
SON_subjugate_south_desc:0 "На юге лежат центральные земли Великих Озёр, обладающие плодородной почвой и процветающими городами. Без этих земель весь регион бессмысленно завоёвывать, что также понимали и Мазви. Предстоящая война будет нелёгкой, поэтому Зонни должен убедиться, что он хорошо подготовлен, прежде чем бросить жребий."
SON_eternal_no_more:0 "Больше не вечен"
SON_eternal_no_more_desc:0 "Династию Зефува из Гелон-Зорну уважают до такой степени, что даже Мазви оставили их в покое. Однако они не проявляли милосердия к другим королям Великих Озёр. Зефува явно не должны ожидать снисхождения от тех, кто потерял всё, пока они набивали брюхо, пользуясь особым отношением от Мазви."
SON_the_golden_fields:0 "Золотые поля"
SON_the_golden_fields_desc:0 "Земли вокруг озёр очень плодородны, на них в изобилии выращивают сорго и просо. Угаби и Аоранда всегда были житницей империи Мазви, кормившей её процветающие города. Новый владыка региона, Зар-Хэй, также воспользуется этим преимуществом, но установит куда меньшие налоги и так заручится поддержкой местных жителей."
SON_haughty_city_states:0 "Надменные города-государства"
SON_haughty_city_states_desc:0 "После своего порабощения города-государства Хайзебленда с дерзостью начали требовать привилегий и автономии в обмен на собственную верность, к чему они привыкли во время правления королевы Бамины. Их высокомерие раздражало Зонни, и хотя его советники рекомендуют всё же предоставить автономию, он предпочёл бы поступить с ними по-другому..."
SON_governor_of_south:0 "Назначить Фарму озёр"
SON_governor_of_south_desc:0 "Сердце земель захвачено, и теперь Зонни контролирует всю кровеносную систему Великих Озёр. Любая торговля теперь будет проходить через Зар-Хэй. Золотые поля Угаби и Аоранды накормят все голодные рты в королевстве. Города Хайзеба будут производить всё, что необходимо. Остаётся только один вопрос: кто будет управлять всем этим?"
SON_revenge:0 "Месть"
SON_revenge_desc:0 "Мазви не должно больше существовать."
SON_search_for_royal_family:0 "Поиск королевской династии"
SON_search_for_royal_family_desc:0 "Армия Зар-Хэя подчинила все территории Мазви, так что теперь можно провести тщательные поиски пропавших заложников из королевской семьи. Если удастся найти хотя бы одного члена династии Зугхе, трон Зар-Хэя больше не будет пустовать. Чтобы доказать, что Зонни не властолюбец, он всем сердцем и силами поддержит эти поиски."
SON_sack_ziani:0 "Разграбление Зиани"
SON_sack_ziani_desc:0 "Зао когда-то был процветающим и великим городом. До прихода Мазви. Теперь Зар-Хэй отомстит проклятым мазвийцам и в ответ опустошит их столицу. Этот урок смирения должен научить их никогда больше не угнетать другие народы! Зиани будет сожжён, его граждане убиты, а промышленность уничтожена."
SON_crush_savages:0 "Поработить дикарей"
SON_crush_savages_desc:0 "Моззи – гордые зебры и поэтому будут отрицать власть Зонни до самого конца. Он покажет им цену неповиновения. Их самых сильных и умелых жеребцов и кобыл обратят в рабство и вынудят сражаться под началом своего нового хозяина, Зонни Золона. Те, кто откажется принять эту новую жизнь, будут забиты до смерти."
SON_governor_of_west:0 "Назначить Мазви-Фарму"
SON_governor_of_west_desc:0 "Когда Зар-Хэй был покорён, а королевская семья взята в заложники, жестокий вождь Мазви был назначен губернатором. Он обложил население тяжёлыми налогами, отбирая все оставшиеся богатства. Теперь ситуация изменилась. Мазви будут страдать под властью жестокого наместника подобно своим бывшим подданным. Интересно, есть ли ещё большее унижение?"
SON_the_coronation:0 "Коронация"
SON_the_coronation_desc:0 "Сыны и дочери Заргитау одержали победу! Все Великие Озёра теперь преклонили колени перед своими новыми законными хозяевами. Когда-то мы были презренным рабами, но этого больше никогда не будет! В этот самый славный день регент Зонни Золон провозгласит новую империю, гордо воспрявшую из руин имперского Мазви."

SON_lessons_from_battles:0 "Уроки битв"
SON_lessons_from_battles_desc:0 "Зонни Золон знает, что каждое сражение – это шанс стать лучше. На ошибках нужно учиться, а успехи нужно повторять. Тактику противника также необходимо анализировать, чтобы можно было найти слабые места и воспользоваться ими. С таким подходом военная стратегия армии постепенно будет отточена до совершенства."
SON_meritocratic_promotion:0 "Меритократическое повышение"
SON_meritocratic_promotion_desc:0 "Воинами должны командовать способные, а не те, кто у кого длинная родословная. Зонни стремится всегда продвигать наиболее отличившихся солдат на высокие должности, чтобы они смогли использовать весь свой боевой опыт для улучшения армии."
SON_ceaseless_drilling:0 "Бесконечная подготовка"
SON_ceaseless_drilling_desc:0 "Строевая подготовка всегда была жизненно важна для ведения войны. Как в прошлом, когда подразделения сражались в строю, так и сейчас, в век огнестрельного оружия, строевая подготовка может привить дисциплину в армии и натренировать слаженность пехоты. Постоянное обучение солдат строевому шагу и подчинению командам повысит всеобщую эффективность."
SON_foreign_military_advisors:0 "Нанять зарубежных инструкторов"
SON_foreign_military_advisors_desc:0 "Хотя некоторые скептически относятся к иностранцам и их причудливым обычаям, никто не сомневается, что их методы ведения войны и изготовления оружия намного более продвинуты, чем те, что используются сейчас на Великих Озёрах. Использование добычи с завоеваний для найма экспертов из-за рубежа значительно поможет модернизировать эти аспекты страны."
SON_formalized_recruitment:0 "Улучшить систему призыва"
SON_formalized_recruitment_desc:0 "В современности каждый гражданин является солдатом. Старые методы племенного сбора и добровольной вербовки слишком неэффективны. С помощью иностранных советников все свободные зебры нации пройдут базовую подготовку и будут призваны в резерв, чтобы быть в случае необходимости готовыми заменить погибших."
SON_supply_logistic_crap:0 "Снабжение и логистика"
SON_supply_logistic_crap_desc:0 "Любой хороший командир знает, что именно логистика решает исход войн. Иностранные советники обнаружили, что цепочки поставок армии Зар-Хэя, к сожалению, в лучшем случае архаичны и неспособны поддерживать снабжение наших сил. Правильно организованная и хорошо спланированная логистика исправит этот недостаток."
SON_retrain_royal_guard:0 "Переподготовка королевской гвардии"
SON_retrain_royal_guard_desc:0 "Самые преданные воины страны служат напрямую королевской династии и являются одними из наилучших бойцов во всём Зар-Хэе. Однако недавние сражения наглядно показали, что их тактика и снаряжение устарели. Это можно исправить, если мы проведём тщательную переподготовку и обновление общей стратегии."
SON_artillery_experimentation:0 "Эксперименты с артиллерией"
SON_artillery_experimentation_desc:0 "Раньше мы редко использовали артиллерию в армии, но сейчас ни у кого не осталось сомнений, что крупный калибр большой дальности имеет огромный потенциал на поле боя. Оружейники должны начать изготавливать новые, более современные образцы тяжёлых орудий, дабы пехота имела надлежащую огневую поддержку."
SON_royal_gun_workshop:0 "Королевская пушечная мастерская"
SON_royal_gun_workshop_desc:0 "Хотя гильдии оружейников прилагают все усилия, чтобы обеспечить армию всем необходимым, но этого недостаточно. Зонни Золон постановил, что в Зао нужно открыть мастерскую, целиком посвящённую производству оружия. В отличие от традиционных гильдий, она будет нанимать неквалифицированных рабочих для повышения объёма производства в ущерб качеству."
SON_meet_with_sorcerer:0 "Встретиться с колдуном"
SON_meet_with_sorcerer_desc:0 "Загадочный вождь племени Зарабара, Фаран, до сих пор оказывал лишь символическую поддержку делу Зонни. Поскольку он известный колдун, его способности могут принести неоценимую пользу королевству. Необходимо организовать встречу, чтобы заручиться его помощью."
SON_anti_resistance_crap:0 "Раздавить любое сопротивление"
SON_anti_resistance_crap_desc:0 ""Если ты уже потерпел поражение, то должен подчиняться новым хозяевам, а не пытаться сопротивляться." Зонни отдаст приказ своим воинам жестоко расправиться со всеми, кто выступит против новой гегемонии Зар-Хэя над Великими Озёрами. Под властью Мазви королевство сильно страдало, и теперь пришло время ощутить это всем остальным."
SON_support_crap:0 "Выделенные подразделения поддержки"
SON_support_crap_desc:0 "Зонни на практике узнал, что далеко не всем воинам нужно сражаться напрямую в бою. Если некоторые из них будут выполнять вспомогательные функции вроде разведки или инженерной подготовки, которые помогают их товарищам перед основным боем. Поэтому следует сформировать специализированные роты поддержки и интегрировать их в армию."

# Civil war 

SON_the_rightful_zuwa:0 "Истинный Зува"
SON_the_rightful_zuwa_desc:0 "Азхай Зугхе может претендовать на титул законного короля Зар-Хэя, но никак не гегемона Великих Озёр! Зонни – вот тот, кто привёл своих воинов к победе, поэтому именно он достоин править! Азхай либо научится преклонять колени, либо умрёт, подобно другим мелким королькам, которых до этого подчинил Золон."
SON_question_identity:0 "Подвергнуть сомнению его личность"
SON_question_identity_desc:0 "Как кто-то может быть уверен, что Азхай действительно тот, за кого себя выдаёт? Простой перстень с печатью сам по себе ничего не доказывает. Поэтому здесь явно не хватает хоть каких-то убедительных доказательств о том, что он действительно наследник престола. Необходимо начать пропагандистскую кампанию и выставить истину на всеобщее обозрение!"
SON_appeal_to_warriors:0 "Воззвать к воинам"
SON_appeal_to_warriors_desc:0 "В то время как многие солдаты присоединились к королю-самозванцу, есть и те, кто всё же засомневался. Они чувствуют, что обязаны следовать за королём, но одновременно осознают, что настоящий лидер тот, кто привёл их к бесчисленным победам. Обращение к подобным солдатам поможет им убедиться в правильности выбора."
SON_put_slaves_to_work:0 "Заставить рабов работать вдвое"
SON_put_slaves_to_work_desc:0 "Из-за недавних войн у нас появилось крайне много рабов, поскольку иначе военнопленных девать было некуда. Однако далеко на вся эта рабочая сила используется эффективно. Сейчас, во время гражданской войны, армия должна быть полностью обеспечена, поэтому рабов нужно заставить трудиться усерднее."
SON_aid_from_advisors:0 "Помощь от советников"
SON_aid_from_advisors_desc:0 "Нанятые ранее иностранные советники могут принести дополнительную пользу. Зонни отправит их на фронт, чтобы они помогли командирам с организацией всех оставшихся лояльными солдат. Пусть они и запросили за это дополнительную плату, но опыт советников принесёт куда большую пользу для армии."
SON_forced_conscription:0 "Насильная мобилизация"
SON_forced_conscription_desc:0 "Нам нужно больше солдат, чтобы раз и навсегда раздавить восстание. Однако опытных воинов уже не хватает, поэтому снова придётся задействовать обычных зебр, чтобы заполнить пробелы в рядах. Победа должна быть достигнута любой ценой."
SON_fear_campaign:0 "Кампания по устрашению"
SON_fear_campaign_desc:0 "Страх – вот что обычно удерживает мятежников и предателей в узде. Но прежняя политика Зонни оказалась слишком мягкой и не смогла  удержать глупцов от присоединения к восстанию. Похоже, он просто не зашёл достаточно далеко. Нужно провести новые акции по устрашению, чтобы показать врагам, что произойдёт с теми, кто окажет сопротивление."
SON_he_shall_not_be_it:0 "Он не станет им!"
SON_he_shall_not_be_it_desc:0 "Королю следовало принять предложение Зонни. Он пытался найти компромисс, но Азхай жаждал абсолютной власти, желая захватить контроль над империей Золона. Но уже недолго Зугхе оставаться королём! До сих пор никто не пережил гнева Зонни. Почему он должен стать исключением?"

SON_the_rightful_king:0 "Истинный король"
SON_the_rightful_king_desc:0 "Если вы читаете это, значит использовали консольную команду. Но всё путём. В качестве пасхалки я расскажу о загадках Бродфельда в описаниях этих фокусов!"
SON_spread_news:0 "Распространить слово"
SON_spread_news_desc:0 "Первый ивент достаточно прост. Он использует шифр Цезаря. Подсказка находится в последнем слове, написанном заглавными буквами, и соответствует OXMI. Так вы сможете легко подобрать нужный шифр и использовать его, чтобы перевести текст и ответы."
SON_liberate_prisoners:0 "Освободить узников войны"
SON_liberate_prisoners_desc:0 "Второе событие более сложное и использует аффинный шифр. То, что выглядит как математическая формула, на самом деле является ключом шифрования, который можно использовать для расшифровки текста. На самом деле вам нужны только коэффициенты A и B из ключа, чтобы расшифровать текст с помощью веб-сайта или программы."
SON_promise_freedom:0 "Пообещать свободу рабам"
SON_promise_freedom_desc:0 "Третье событие сбивает с толку многих, несмотря на то, что оно не зашифровано. Это всё потому, что загадка из сферы астрофизики, но даже если вы шарите в ней, она может сбить с толку. В ней описывается образование урана в сверхновой и последовательность распада его изотопов. Ответ заключается в способе окончательного распада на свинец."
SON_amnesty_for_scholars:0 "Амнистия учёным"
SON_amnesty_for_scholars_desc:0 "В отличие от предыдущего, четвертый ивент представляет собой простой вопрос с подвохом. Правильный ответ вполне очевиден. Пятый ивент требует базового знакомства с франшизой MLP. Когда вы узнаете характерные черты и предысторию трёх принцесс, ответ снова становится довольно очевидным."
SON_united_against_tyranny:0 "Едины против тирании"
SON_united_against_tyranny_desc:0 "В шестом ивенте используются различные языки, которые необходимо перевести. Самый простой способ это сделать – просто воспользоваться онлайн-переводчиком, хотя некоторые из используемых языков несколько неочевидны. Ответ на седьмой ивент очевиден, если учесть, что у Клосау завязаны глаза."
SON_expose_his_crimes:0 "Разоблачить его преступления"
SON_expose_his_crimes_desc:0 "Восьмой ивент – это загадка и в некотором роде вопрос с подвохом. Хотя на первый взгляд может показаться, что все ответы подходят, только один из них правильный. Забавно, что на самом деле ивент основан на реальной легенде о масонах. Суть аллегории и будет ответом."
SON_long_live_the_king:0 "Долгих лет жизни королю!"
SON_long_live_the_king_desc:0 "Девятый ивент – последний шанс просто вернуться на обычный путь Бродфельда. В описаниях фокусов не было прямых ответов, но, надеюсь, подсказок будет достаточно, чтобы во всем разобраться."

SON_the_four_oaths:0 "Четыре клятвы"
SON_the_four_oaths_desc:0 "После гражданской войны Зува должен гарантировать вечную верность своих подданных. Все, кто служит величайшей нации зебр в Зебрике, должны принести четыре клятвы. В них кратко излагаются основные стремления всей нации в целом. Их осуществление принесёт величие Великим Озёрам!"
SON_prosperity_to_the_nation:0 "Процветание нации"
SON_prosperity_to_the_nation_desc:0 ""Да будет бог мне свидетелем, я торжественно клянусь посвятить свою жизнь усердному и эффективному труду для дальнейшего развития моей славной имперской родины. Я послушно отдам часть своего богатства Зуве, чтобы он мог мудро использовать его для общего блага нации.""
SON_negotiate_with_reem:0 "Провести переговоры с ре-эмцами"
SON_negotiate_with_reem_desc:0 "Несмотря на то, что помощь ре-эмцев стала огромным подспорьем для страны, экономика Зар-Хэя остаётся недостаточно развитой. Ей требуется дополнительная помощь, и Зонни должен обеспечить продолжение сотрудничества. Поэтому он должен посетить страну и убедиться, что нынешние взаимовыгодные отношения будут продолжены."
SON_urban_commercialization:0 "Коммерциализация городов"
SON_urban_commercialization_desc:0 "Города ре-эмцев процветают благодаря системе свободной торговли, частной собственности и экономической конкуренции. Аналогичная система должна быть внедрена в городах Великих Озёр. Зува уже издал указ об отмене налоговых тарифов в городах, роспуске гильдий и установлении правовых рамок собственности."
SON_rural_collectivization:0 "Коллективизация сельских районов"
SON_rural_collectivization_desc:0 "Сельская местность ре-эмцев разделена на коллективные общины. Они владеют землёй и работают на ней, делясь произведённой продукцией между собой. Поскольку это похоже на традиционную систему клановой собственности, внедрить аналогичную систему в Великих Озёрах будет не так тяжело. Это также простимулирует сельскохозяйственное сотрудничество."
SON_striving_for_self_suffiency:0 "Стремление к самодостаточности"
SON_striving_for_self_suffiency_desc:0 "Полагаться на других – значит проявлять слабость, а Зар-Хэй должен быть сильным. Важность стратегических ресурсов возрастает по мере модернизации вооружённых сил, поэтому с помощью ре-эмцев нужно расширять и совершенствовать производственные объекты. Хотя полная автаркия невозможна, внутренние поставки всегда более надёжны, чем зарубежные."
SON_imperial_railway:0 "Имперская железная дорога"
SON_imperial_railway_desc:0 "Железные дороги – это транспорт будущего. У ре-эмцев уже есть опыт в их строительстве, поэтому с их помощью мы можем построить грандиозную железную дорогу, соединяющую Тимбакту и Зано. Она станет символом постоянно растущего развития Имперского Царства!"
SON_imperial_guilds:0 "Имперские гильдии"
SON_imperial_guilds_desc:0 "Каста ремесленников Зар-Хэя традиционно делится на различные гильдии, каждая из которых специализируется на производстве различных видов продукции. Но они становятся слишком архаичными для современной эпохи. Будут созданы новые государственные и общенациональные имперские гильдии для управления квалифицированной рабочей силой от имени Зувы."
SON_question_of_slavery:0 "К вопросу о рабстве"
SON_question_of_slavery_desc:0 "Жёсткая кастовая система всегда была частью общества Зар-Хэя, и рабство являлось одним из его столпов. Однако в новое время перемен эта традиция подвергается сомнению. К тому же Ре-эм продолжает оказывать давление на Зуву, требуя отменить "варварскую" практику. Как он решит эту проблему?"
SON_renovation_of_zao:0 "Реновация Зао"
SON_renovation_of_zao_desc:0 "До возвышения Мазви Зао был жемчужиной королевства с процветающими рынками, широкими улицами и высокими домами. За два столетия иностранной оккупации город превратился в жалкую тень своего прежнего величия. И теперь Зонни восстановит утраченную славу и превратит его в столицу, достойную править целой Империей!"
SON_grand_burial_mound:0 "Великий могильный курган"
SON_grand_burial_mound_desc:0 "У представителей аристократической касты принято возводить курганы для себя и своей семьи. Тот, что построил отец Зонни, довольно небольшой, поскольку он был не слишком богат. Но его семья достойна куда большего, и поэтому Зува решил построить новый могильный курган, самый большой из когда-либо виденных на Великих Озёрах."
SON_offer_they_cant_refuse:0 "Безотказное предложение"
SON_offer_they_cant_refuse_desc:0 "За прошедшие годы связь между Зар-Хэем и Ре-эмом стала очень тесной. Причём настолько тесной, что по факту у них больше нет причин оставаться отдельными нациями. В качестве кульминации всех достигнутых высот, Ре-эму будет предоставлен шанс присоединиться к Имперскому Царству. Без возможности отклонить это щедрое предложение."
SON_loyalty_to_the_zuwa:0 "Клятва верности Зуве"
SON_loyalty_to_the_zuwa_desc:0 ""Да будет бог мне свидетелем, я торжественно клянусь посвятить свою жизнь служению Зуве. Я не буду участвовать в заговорах против него или его подданных ради мира и порядка в государстве. Я буду беспрекословно выполнять приказы его наместников, зная, что их мудрость превосходит мою.""
SON_reward_the_loyal:0 "Наградить сохранивших верность"
SON_reward_the_loyal_desc:0 "Гражданская война была выиграна только благодаря героическим усилиям тех, кто отказался предать Зуву. Многие отдали свои жизни в борьбе с предателями. Выжившие  заслуживают благодарности. Души павших – уважения. Да будет известно, что Зонни щедр и добр к своим верным подданным."
SON_council_of_generals:0 "Совет командиров"
SON_council_of_generals_desc:0 "Зува не может править в одиночку. Ему нужны компетентные советники. И кто может лучше справиться с этой ролью, как не офицеры, сражавшиеся на стороне Зонни? Они зарекомендовали себя как верные и компетентные зебры. Благодаря созданию консультативного совета военных командиров Зар-Хэй всегда будет в безопасности."
SON_service_guarantees_citizenship:0 "Служба гарантирует гражданство"
SON_service_guarantees_citizenship_desc:0 "Понятие "подданный Зар-Хэя" должно быть реформировано и оформлено в виде современного гражданства. Статус имперского гражданина будет включать в себя все основные права и льготы. Однако для его получения потребуется несколько лет военной службы. Таким образом, зебр будут всячески поощрять вступать в ряды армии империи."
SON_arms_industry_crap:0 "Имперский арсенал"
SON_arms_industry_crap_desc:0 "Для снабжения постоянно растущей имперской армии требуются улучшенные производственные линии и складские помещения. Для этой цели в Анзонго будет построен великий арсенал. Уже существующая промышленная база послужит отличным фундаментом для такого предприятия."
SON_reshape_identity:0 "Изменение идентичности"
SON_reshape_identity_desc:0 "Традиционно быть членом Зар-Хэя означало быть потомком Заргитау. Но разве племя раньше не стало бы сильнее, если не принимало в свои ряды новых зебр? Мазви потерпели крах, потому что это было одно племя, подчинявшее себе других. Зар-Хэй же достигнет процветания, потому что это будет одно племя, объединяющее все остальные под одним знаменем."
SON_cultural_synthesis:0 "Культурный синтез"
SON_cultural_synthesis_desc:0 "Нельзя допустить застоя культуры Зар-Хэя или её изоляции. Чтобы действительно укрепить самобытность, необходимо объединить элементы других сильных культур, существующих на Великих Озёрах. Так Зар-Хэй станет сильнее как племя. Это также значительно облегчит процесс ассимиляции остальных народов."
SON_language_standardization:0 "Стандартизация языка"
SON_language_standardization_desc:0 "На Великих Озёрах говорят на сотнях языков, и даже в самом Зар-Хэе существует множество местных диалектов. В интересах администрации необходимо создать единый официальный язык – диалект Зао для всего Зар-Хэя. Затем этот язык будет преподаваться в школах по всей стране."
SON_death_to_the_traitors:0 "Смерть предателям"
SON_death_to_the_traitors_desc:0 ""Да будет бог мне свидетелем, я торжественно клянусь посвятить свою жизнь безопасности государства. У меня не будет иных чувств, кроме презрения к тем, кто предал нацию. Я не стану помогать шпионам и заговорщикам, а вместо этого сообщу о них наместникам Зувы, дабы они разобрались с изменниками.""
SON_police_force:0 "Ассара-Мунидиос"
SON_police_force_desc:0 "Недавний хаос на Великих Озёрах привел к росту преступности, поэтому честным зебрам пришлось жить в страхе перед безжалостными отбросами общества. Но теперь, когда наступил мир, должен прийти и порядок. Имперские правоохранители, Ассара-Мунидиос, будут следить за соблюдением законов и наказывать злодеев."
SON_some_spy_shit_idk:0 "Глаза Зувы"
SON_some_spy_shit_idk_desc:0 "Король-самозванец одурачил Зонни и застал его врасплох, втайне готовя восстание. Нельзя допустить, чтобы это когда-либо повторилось! Шпионы проникнут во все слои общества и будут искать любые признаки измены. Они также будут полезны и против иностранного шпионажа. Да будет известно, что у Зува видит всё!"
SON_religious_pluralism:0 "Религиозный плюрализм"
SON_religious_pluralism_desc:0 "На Великих Озёрах существует множество различных верований и способов поклонения богам. Зонни ранее провозгласил общую толерантность, но теперь равенство всех религий должно быть закреплено законом. Даже к странной вере ре-эмцев следует относиться терпимо, а их общины должны быть интегрированы."
SON_mass_education:0 "Всеобщее образование"
SON_mass_education_desc:0 "Формирование устойчивого общества требует обязательного образования для всех граждан и их потомков. К тому же, чтобы стать по-настоящему сильной и развитой нацией, необходимы квалифицированные работники, и единственный способ их получить – это образование. Посещение государственных школ станет обязательным под угрозой порки."
SON_diminished_persecution:0 "Ослабление подавления интеллектуалов"
SON_diminished_persecution_desc:0 "Зува Зонни не доверял учёным с тех пор, как зебры Тимбакту устроили заговор против него. Советники Золона постоянно пытались переубедить его, расписывая преимущества поддержки интеллектуалов, но их предложения оставались без внимания. До сих пор. Зонни наконец-то согласился в какой-то степени смягчить свою позицию."
SON_fate_of_the_caste_system:0 "Судьба кастовой системы"
SON_fate_of_the_caste_system_desc:0 "В традиционных обществах Великих Озёр браки между представителями разных групп не одобрялись. Кастовая система обеспечивала социальную гармонию и поддерживала жёсткую иерархию, однако теперь её полезность вызывает сомнения. Возможно, она приносит больше вреда, чем пользы Имперскому Царству?"
SON_imperial_academy:0 "Имперская академия"
SON_imperial_academy_desc:0 "Меритократическое повышение само по себе не гарантирует способности зебр. Многообещающие умы необходимо развивать и совершенствовать, чтобы они могли полностью раскрыть свой потенциал. Для этой цели будет создано специальное учебное заведение, в котором начнут работать и делиться знаниями умелые иностранные преподаватели."
SON_glory_to_the_army:0 "Честь и слава армии"
SON_glory_to_the_army_desc:0 ""Да будет бог мне свидетелем, я торжественно клянусь посвятить свою жизнь защите страны от любых иностранных вторжений. Я откликнусь на призыв, когда нужен буду на фронте. Я никогда не покину армию и не сдамся врагу, сражаясь насмерть, если потребуется.""
SON_new_model_army:0 "Концепция новой армии Нью Модел"
SON_new_model_army_desc:0 "Империя Мазви пала, потому что не смогла адаптироваться. Именно поэтому современная армия Короля Шторма с лёгкостью уничтожила её. Нью Модел, иностранный офицер из далёкой Эквестрии, предложила ряд радикальных реформ, направленных на превращение имперской армии в по-настоящему современную боевую силу, способную дать отпор любому захватчику."
SON_recruit_ugabi_officers:0 "Вербовать офицеров Угаби"
SON_recruit_ugabi_officers_desc:0 "Прежде чем воины Зонни разгромили Угаби, армия этой страны вложила значительные средства в модернизацию своих вооружённых сил и даже создала бронетанковую бригаду. Знания бывших офицеров обладают невероятной ценностью, и поэтому мы предложим им свободу в обмен на опыт ведения боя с применением бронетехники, который будет крайне полезен."
SON_establish_air_force:0 "Летающие зебры"
SON_establish_air_force_desc:0 "Ключевым фактором военного успеха Короля Шторма было использование им авиации. Дирижабли уже устарели из-за новых технологий, которые Зар-Хэй должен как можно быстрее освоить. Необходимо построить самолёты, обучить пилотов и создать авиабазы. Новые имперские военно-воздушные силы вскоре окажут жизненно важную поддержку армии."
SON_first_trial:0 "Первое испытание новой армии"
SON_first_trial_desc:0 "Реформы Нью Модел идут полным ходом, но новую армию ещё предстоит испытать на практике. На востоке, в хаосе, последовавшем за крахом Мазви и смертью Короля Шторма, военачальник йети создал собственное королевство. Обеспечение безопасности восточной границы Зар-Хэя станет отличным поводом для военных испытаний армии."
SON_land_of_dervishes:0 "Земли дервишей"
SON_land_of_dervishes_desc:0 "На востоке остаются наследники некогда могущественного королевства Гиении, которые пострадали от короля Шторма равноценно Мазви. Однако они восстановили свои силы и представляют потенциальную угрозу восточной границе Имперского Царства. Они должны подчиниться власти Зонни. Ведь иначе религиозным пустынным собакам попросту нельзя доверять."
SON_fortify_borders:0 "Укрепить границы"
SON_fortify_borders_desc:0 "Зува захватил немало новых земель и теперь Зар-Хэй граничит со многими государствами, которые потенциально могут стать врагами. Необходимо защитить новые границы, дабы не потерять их с той же лёгкостью, с какой были захвачены. Тысячи рабочих будут задействованы на строительстве бесчисленных оборонительных сооружений по всей границе Империи."
SON_elixir_of_life:0 "Эликсир жизни"
SON_elixir_of_life_desc:0 "Имперское Царство было построено исключительно с опорой на Зуву. Однако он не бессмертен, и у него нет наследника. Он боится, что вся проделанная им работа обратится в прах, если его будущие дети будут ссориться из-за наследства. Но если он никогда не умрёт, то такой проблемы не будет. Наверняка уже изобрели лекарство от смерти?"
SON_pacify_the_south:0 "Усмирить юг"
SON_pacify_the_south_desc:0 "Преемники Короля Шторма сражались в гражданской войне долгие годы. Это сделало их слабыми и разобщёнными. Но это не будет продолжаться вечно. Нужно любой ценой предотвратить появление ещё одного завоевателя, подобного Королю Шторму! Йети необходимо уничтожить как можно скорее, пока не стало слишком поздно."
SON_demand_ovingoland:0 "Потребовать Овинголенд"
SON_demand_ovingoland_desc:0 "Во время хаоса, вызванного крахом Мазви, тысячи беженцев бежали на север c Великих Озёр. Они поселились в малонаселённой земле, известной как Овинголенд. Может быть, они не слишком заинтересованы в возвращении в свои дома, однако это будет отличным поводом для... "обеспечения безопасности" северной границы Зар-Хэя."
SON_secure_the_west:0 "Secure The West"
SON_secure_the_west_desc:0 "The Imperial Realm's western land border has become long, yet it could be made much shorter. It is a strategic necessity to invade the Saddle Arabian splinter states of the Riseian peninsula, before they fall under the control of potentially hostile powers. The west must be secured, so the Realm is safe from all cardinal directions."
SON_create_navy_crap:0 "Establish The Imperial Navy"
SON_create_navy_crap_desc:0 "Once Zar-Hay was a landlocked state, but no more. Vast stretches of coastline have been acquired and naval trade routes established, which now need to be defended from potential enemy attacks. Mere river canoes are no longer enough: A proper oceanic navy is needed, with modern vessels made of steel."
SON_ozymandias:0 "Look On My Works, Ye Mighty, And Despair!"
SON_ozymandias_desc:0 "Zuwa Zonni has made his mark on the history of the world. He took the small and impoverished realm of Zar-Hay and forged it with fire and blood into a mighty and vast Imperial Realm, becoming one of the major powers of Zebrica. He can rest well knowing that his legacy will endure for countless generations."

# Post-Zonni epilogue tree

SON_crush_the_rebels:0 "Crush The Rebels"
SON_crush_the_rebels_desc:0 "Unlike Zonni, Meynsata is a warrior of honour. But even she has little tolerance for traitors and rebels, especially when they see her as a weakling. While she understands their bitterness about Zonni's reign, she hoped they would've given her a chance. But they did not. Now, they shall regret it."
SON_promise_reform:0 "Promise Reform"
SON_promise_reform_desc:0 "Despite some token reforms such as abolishing slavery, the conditions for the lower classes remained poor. Meynsata intends to improve their situation, not only out of empathy but to secure the stability of her uncertain reign. She will promise widespread social reforms to curb revolutionary support."
SON_reform_admin:0 "Reorganize Administration"
SON_reform_admin_desc:0 "The system of governorates established by Zonni proved to be cumbersome, and gave far too much power and influence to the appointed governors. A more sustainable system needs to be created. The large governorates will be carved up into numerous smaller provinces. The current governors will all be dismissed."
SON_end_repression:0 "End The Repression Of Scholars"
SON_end_repression_desc:0 "Ever since the conquest of Timbucktu, Zonni distrusted scholars and saw them as enemies of the state. Now that he is gone, there is no need to be excessively paranoid. The Zuwa commands that all unjust prosecution of intellectuals shall be ended immediately. She also formally apologizes for their previous treatment."
SON_reemite_autonomy:0 "Grant Autonomy To Re'em"
SON_reemite_autonomy_desc:0 "The Re'emites did much to help the Imperial Realm, yet received nothing in return. Instead, Zonni took away their precious liberty and annexed them directly into his personal domain. This injustice shall now be undone, and the Re'emites will be rewarded for their faithful service to Zar-Hay."
SON_revise_the_oaths:0 "Revise The Oaths"
SON_revise_the_oaths_desc:0 "The four oaths that formed the backbone of Zonni's rule were regarded as draconian and authoritarian. While their core principles were not flawed, the wording of the oaths was often criticised. The oaths should be revised so the Zuwa's subjects are more willing to fulfill them."
SON_trade_policy:0 "Formalize Trade Policy"
SON_trade_policy_desc:0 "Zonni never cared much for economic legislation and left most such matters to his advisors. As such, a clear national policy on trade with foreign countries was never established. Meynsata seeks to revise this, despite lacking any economic knowledge as well. She will consult her advisors before making a decision."
SON_end_the_experiment:0 "End The Experiment"
SON_end_the_experiment_desc:0 "Zonni had a grand ambition of uniting the disparate tribes of the Great Lakes into a single superculture, and he was partially successful. Yet policies of forced cultural assimiliation have angered many Imperial subjects, and appeasing them is necessary to maintain integrity of the realm. Therefore no further programs of social engineering shall be conducted."
SON_estates_of_the_realm:0 "Form The Great Assembly"
SON_estates_of_the_realm_desc:0 "The Imperial Mazwi of the past had a deliberative assembly, the Gbara, where leading members of Mazwian clans could vote on political matters. A similar governmental body would be very useful to Meynsata, so she can leave drafting of policies to the nobility, while she herself can focus on defending the nation."
SON_zonnis_legacy:0 "Zonni's Legacy"
SON_zonnis_legacy_desc:0 "With Meynsata's reforms, more and more zebras dare to speak out negatively about Zonni and his deeds. He has become a controversial figure, and his legacy is being questioned. How should he be remembered by the future generations? It is up to Meynsata to decide how history books will be written."

SON_back_home_desc:0 "После стольких лет терзаний и ожиданий Король и его семья наконец-то вернулись в своё племя в Зар-Хэе. Настало время ликования и радости, ведь королевство вновь обрело своего правителя."
SON_golden_tablets_of_zao:0 "Золотые скрижали"
SON_golden_tablets_of_zao_desc:0 "Анархия, царившая на Великих Озёрах в последнее десятилетие, должна закончиться. Слуги Короля провозгласят новый свод законов, вдохновленные текстами Гулу из Угаби и высеченные на золотых скрижалях. Они упразднят рабство и заложат прочный фундамент честного и справедливого общества."
SON_continue_cooperation_with_reem:0 "Продолжить сотрудничество с Ре-эм"
SON_continue_cooperation_with_reem_desc:0 "У прежнего регента Зонни сложились довольно близкие отношения с Ре-эмом. Хотя он уже не у власти, у нас нет причин разрывать наши плодотворные отношения с лошадьми. Более того, мы должны сблизить два народа с помощью мирной дипломатии и торговли."
SON_support_the_scholars:0 "Поддержать учёных"
SON_support_the_scholars_desc:0 "Во время правления Зонни учёные подвергались массовым и несправедливым гонениям. После смены власти Азхай положил этому конец, но подобных мер недостаточно. Чтобы показать интеллигенции Великих Озёр, что Король любит образование и мудрость, будет основана новая организация, призванная поддерживать научные начинания."
SON_a_professional_army:0 "Профессионализация армии"
SON_a_professional_army_desc:0 "Зонни не делал различий между солдатами и мирными жителями. Для него любая зебра была потенциальным воином. Но королевская армия будет другой. В её ряды будут принимать только самых лучших, и они станут преданными солдатами, чьё довольствие пойдёт прямо из королевской казны."
SON_secure_trade_routes:0 "Обезопасить торговые пути"
SON_secure_trade_routes_desc:0 "Когда-то торговля была жизненной силой Великих Озёр, но долгие годы конфликтов уничтожили все налаженные связи, поскольку торговые пути стали слишком опасными. Теперь здесь снова царят мир и порядок, но Азхай пойдёт дальше. Вдоль торговых путей будут построены гарнизоны, на разбойников объявят охоту, а с другими странами будут заключены новые соглашения."
SON_import_machinery:0 "Импорт промышленного оборудования"
SON_import_machinery_desc:0 "Машины представляют собой ключ к новой "промышленной революции". Они обеспечивают более эффективное производство товаров, что приводит к процветанию общества в целом. Но в Великих Озёрах мало зебр, умеющих создавать такие механизмы. К счастью, ре-эмцы с радостью предоставят нам не только опыт, но и сами машины."
SON_educate_every_zebra:0 "Всеобщее образование"
SON_educate_every_zebra_desc:0 "Традиционно в Великих Озёрах образование было привилегией богатых зебр из высшей касты. Но Азхай хочет, чтобы это изменилось. Он считает, что каждый имеет право на образование и что это значительно продвинет общество в целом. Для решения этой грандиозной задачи он привлечёт учёных из Ре-эма и Тимбакту."
SON_build_a_bureaucratic_machine:0 "Построить бюрократическую машину"
SON_build_a_bureaucratic_machine_desc:0 "Король правит Зар-Хэем, но в целом ему приходится делегировать надзор за исполнением своих законов чиновникам. После завоеваний Зонни Зар-Хэй превратился в огромное королевство. Чтобы управлять всем им, правительство должно расширить сферу своего влияния, увеличив бюрократический аппарат до невиданных размеров с помощью интеллигенции."
SON_royal_air_force:0 "Основать Королевские ВВС"
SON_royal_air_force_desc:0 "Одним из факторов, приведших к краху Мазви, было отсутствие военно-воздушных сил, что позволило Королю Шторму использовать свои дирижабли без какого-либо сопротивления. Небеса Зар-Хэя будут защищать не только Небесный Жеребец, но и наши отважные пилоты."
SON_refurbish_royal_guard:0 "Реформировать королевскую свиту"
SON_refurbish_royal_guard_desc:0 "Королевская свита продолжала существовать даже без своего Короля. В обмен на их нерушимую верность Король Азхай не только предоставит им все необходимые ресурсы, но и прикажет провести ряд реформ, чтобы расширить их состав, улучшить качество обучения и обновить снаряжение. Благодаря всему этому они станут сильным ядром королевской армии."
SON_abolish_guilds:0 "Abolish The Guild System"
SON_abolish_guilds_desc:0 "Guilds, associations of skilled artisans, have existed in the Great Lakes for a long time. But we live in an age where old traditions and their usefulness are reconsidered. Guilds hinder trade, innovation and proliferation of skills. They benefit nozebra except those who belong in them. Thus, they shall be disbanded."
SON_canal_network:0 "Build A Canal Network"
SON_canal_network_desc:0 "The Great Lakes are a region of not only lakes, but also many rivers. They contain plentiful water which can be used to irrigate farms. Building a network of irrigation canals would require plenty of effort, but would be worthwhile in the end as it would greatly increase farm yields and thus improve rural productivity, allowing fewer farmers to feed more mouths."
SON_royal_railways:0 "The Royal Railways"
SON_royal_railways_desc:0 "Railways are the transportation method of tomorrow. Zebras will no longer have to pull heavy wagons along roads, as instead wheeled machines with engines can pull huge loads along tracks of steel. With the help of our Re'emite friends, a new railway company will be founded, with the goal to connect every major city in the Kingdom."
SON_a_center_of_learning:0 "A Center Of Learning"
SON_a_center_of_learning_desc:0 "The university of Timbucktu is famous, but is also the only one of its kind in the Great Lakes. With royal patronage, a new university shall be established in the capital of the Kingdom itself. Intellectuals from across the region and Re'em will be invited to teach there, and students will be welcomed with open hooves."
SON_administrative_reform:0 "Administrative Reform"
SON_administrative_reform_desc:0 "The governorates established by Zonni felt like a hasty, temporary affair. They are far too large and cumbersome to continue to exist. Therefore, in his wisdom, the King has decreed that the governorates will be abolished, and the Kingdom reorganized into smaller provinces, whose governors will have greatly reduced autonomy."
SON_royal_armory:0 "The Royal Armory"
SON_royal_armory_desc:0 "Firepower is the key to modern warfare, and the Kingdom lacks heavy guns. To alleviate the shortage of weapons, the King has decreed the establishment of a royal armory in Zao, which will be dedicated to producing and stockpiling armaments based on foreign designs."
SON_army_motorization:0 "Motorize The Army"
SON_army_motorization_desc:0 "Wagons powered by combustion engines, so-called trucks, can carry heavy loads across moderate distances, even in rough terrain. They can carry far more supplies than zebras can alone. Ensuring the royal army knows how to operate and maintain these trucks will be a boon to the logistics of the army. It is said an army marches on its stomach, but our army will drive on wheels."
SON_march_to_the_east:0 "March Into The Zebhara"
SON_march_to_the_east_desc:0 "Following the collapse of both Imperial Mazwi and the Storm Kingdom, a mad yeti warlord carved an empire of his own in the eastern desert. While Azkhai prefers to avoid war, there is no denying that [CZR.GetNameDef] would be better off as part of the Kingdom of Zar-Hay. Therefore, the royal army shall go to the east and occupy that land."
SON_coca_cola:0 "Support The Kola-Cola Company"
SON_coca_cola_desc:0 "With recent economic developments, many new private companies are being established to replace the guilds of old. One of these is the Kola-Cola company, founded by a zebra who invented a new type of soft drink made from kola nuts. This drink is proven to be very delicious and popular, and the King himself is fond of it. Let everyone enjoy the flavour of Kola-Cola!"
SON_royal_charity:0 "Royal Charity"
SON_royal_charity_desc:0 "As the King of Zar-Hay, Azkhai is a wealthy zebra. But he has little need for riches as he lives a relatively humble life. He wishes for his subjects to enjoy prosperity too, and plans to initiate a program of royal charity, where the poor and needy get a share of his wealth."
SON_planned_urbanization:0 "Planned Urbanization"
SON_planned_urbanization_desc:0 "As Zar-Hay develops into a modern country, its cities grow rapidly with all the zebras moving into them from the countryside. If this growth is not carefully managed, then squalid slums will grow like mushrooms in rain. The government must ensure there's paved streets, proper housing and plumbing so the cities grow in an orderly manner."
SON_cultural_pluralism:0 "Cultural Pluralism"
SON_cultural_pluralism_desc:0 "Zar-Hay is a kingdom of many peoples, not just the Zar-Hay themselves. Diversity is our strength, not our weakness. While Zar-Hay is first among equals, the traditions and languages of other cultures will be respected. This will make them more eager to serve their King, even if he is a foreigner to them."
SON_kill_yeti:0 "Crush The Yeti"
SON_kill_yeti_desc:0 "Ever since its formation, the Storm Kingdom has been a menace to its neighbours, enslaving zebras and sacking everything valuable. Even Zao was not spared from their barbarity. The yeti must be militarily defeated once and for all so they never again threaten other races. Only then can we have peace here in southern Zebrica."
SON_approach_qaylids:0 "The Qaylidi Question"
SON_approach_qaylids_desc:0 "The dervishes of the east are mysterious folk and little is known about them. They practice a strange religion and the only thing we share in common is hatred of the yeti. Our relations do not need to be hostile however, but only if they are open to diplomacy. Otherwise, we'll have no choice but to see them as a threat."
SON_resolve_ovingoland:0 "Welcome Back Ovingoland Refugees"
SON_resolve_ovingoland_desc:0 "During the Storm King's rampage in the Great Lakes, hundreds of thousands of zebras fled north into the lands of Maregypt. They formed their own identity, that of "Ovingoland", and stirred trouble in their new home. Now that there is peace and security in the Great Lakes once more, the refugees can return home. All we have to do is ask [766.owner.GetNameDef] to let them go."
SON_phase_out_castes:0 "Phase Out The Caste System"
SON_phase_out_castes_desc:0 "The caste system is an old part of Zar-Hay culture, but in this new age, there is an incentive to increase class mobility. Allowing zebras to choose their profession rather than have it dictated by birth will enable more and more zebras to rise from destitution. Of course, there's the possibility that this will anger the upper castes who jealously guard their power..."
SON_expand_canal_network:0 "Expand The Canal Network"
SON_expand_canal_network_desc:0 "Rivers and lakes are used extensively for transport, yet they were made by nature, and thus don't always make for efficient travel routes. By digging even more artificial canals, the flow of water can be redirected and new, safe highways made for ships. This will shorten travel times and expenses considerably and help the Kingdom prosper."
SON_cult_of_sky_stallion:0 "Cult Of The Sky Stallion"
SON_cult_of_sky_stallion_desc:0 "The zebras of the Great Lakes share little in common, except for one thing: A concept of a God who is above both ancestors and Spirits. If a cult is created around this entity, which in Zar-Hay is known as the Sky Stallion, then the subjects of the Kingdom can be united by a single faith. The misguided Prophet of Macigena had a similar idea, but we will not force it upon anyzebra."
SON_develop_zwahile:0 "Develop Zwahile"
SON_develop_zwahile_desc:0 "The region of Zwahile Coast suffered under yeti rule for about a decade. It was once a prosperous and developed land under Mazwian rule, but the yetis ruined it, driving thousands into misery and poverty. Now that Zar-Hay has liberated Zwahile, it can be restored to its former glory with the aid of King Azkhai."
SON_royal_navy:0 "Found The Royal Navy"
SON_royal_navy_desc:0 "Zar-Hay technically already had a navy, consisting of river canoes and smaller vessels. The new Royal Navy however will be a proper oceanic military force, now that the Kingdom finally owns some coastline. Its duty will be to guard the coasts and the vital shipping lanes to the rest of the world."
SON_steel_chariots:0 "Self-Propelled Steel Chariots"
SON_steel_chariots_desc:0 "Long ago, chariots were used by the zebras of the Great Lakes for waging war. Now, chariots are making a return, but in a very different form. Known abroad as "tanks", these vehicles are made of steel, have a large gun and use engines and tracks to move forward at great velocity. They would make a fine addition to the arsenal of the Royal Army."
SON_worker_protection:0 "Protect The Workers"
SON_worker_protection_desc:0 "The economy of Zar-Hay went through growing pains, but it has now matured. There is no need to withhold proper salaries from hard-working labourers who were the true architects of modernity. By official decree, the King will ensure every worker receives their due. Those employers who take advantage of them or abuse them will be punished."
SON_universal_education:0 "The Royal Library"
SON_universal_education_desc:0 "King Azkhai wants Zar-Hay to be a truly civilized Kingdom. As such, he plans to establish a new grand library in Zao with the support of the scholars. Literature of all kinds will be acquired from abroad, translated and stored there for any zebra to read freely. Knowledge is not a privilege for the few, but a right for all."
SON_secure_the_borders:0 "Secure The Borders"
SON_secure_the_borders_desc:0 "Every zebra in Zar-Hay wishes for everlasting peace, but that can only be possible if the borders are secured. Any hostile regimes should be dealt with swiftly, while diplomatic negotiations should be held with the more reasonable governments."
SON_my_work_here_is_done:0 "My Work Here Is Done"
SON_my_work_here_is_done_desc:0 "King Azkhai The Great has done much for Zar-Hay, ruling with wisdom and benevolence. Yet no zebra can rule forever. He is old, and time is deteriorating his body. It is becoming clearer and clearer that he cannot remain as King. He has therefore decided to abdicate, and allow one of his heirs to succeed him."

Of course, if their experiments end up unveiling other kinds of potions that can be useful too."

SON_beginning_of_golden_age_desc:0 "King Muza has established solid foundations for his reign. Now he can fully embrace his new role as the supreme ruler of the Great Lakes.

How embarrasing!"
SON_overshadowing_azkhai:0 "Overshadowing Azkhai"
SON_overshadowing_azkhai_desc:0 "Zin's reign will be glorious. Many zebras praise Azkhai and have fond memories of him, but he was nothing compared to his sister! The Queen will begin a new age of enlightenment and glory to all of the Great Lakes! Historians and biographers will write countless books about her wise and just rule."
SON_proclaim_godhood:0 "Proclaim Godhood"

SON_enforce_the_cult_desc:0 "There are many who do not believe the words of the King. How dare they doubt him? He is a prophet blessed by wisdom, who can see the future.

SON_translate_foreign_works:0 "An Enlightened Kingdom"
SON_translate_foreign_works_desc:0 "The subjects of Zar-Hay should be among the most educated and knowledgeable creatures on Zebrica, if not the entire world. As such, more universities, libraries and schools should be established across the Kingdom and staffed by the most qualified personnel possible."
SON_council_of_economic_development:0 "Establish The Council Of Economic Development"
SON_council_of_economic_development_desc:0 "The Queen cannot rule alone. To help her manage the kingdom's economic policy, she will form a council of leading merchants and business owners. With their advice, Zar-Hay will continue to develop into a prospering, productive nation."

SON_a_harmonious_society:0 "A Harmonious Society"
SON_a_harmonious_society_desc:0 "Despite being made out of many different cultures and many different social classes, the kingdom of Zar-Hay prides itself on its peaceful society. Crime rates are low, zebras respect one another and conflicts are resolved through negotiations. While it is not a perfect utopia, it is nevertheless a good place to live in."
SON_form_alliance:0 "Form The Grand Alliance"
SON_form_alliance_desc:0 "It is not enough to simply protect neighbouring states. They should be invited into a true, formal cooperative alliance. Armies will work together as one, and the scholars of the allied nations will freely share their knowledge with one another. This way, every member of the alliance becomes stronger when united as one."

SON_rally_labourers:0 "Rally The Labourers"
SON_rally_labourers_desc:0 "What keeps the lower castes servile and dormant? Their lack of greater consciousness and inability to organize.

SON_saboteurs_desc: "Workers who toil in factories or maintain vital infrastructure are secretly willing to cooperate with our revolutionary movement. Once we give the signal, they will sabotage everything they can, wrecking machines, ruining workshops, blowing up roads and bridges and so on. They will cause widespread damage and sow chaos among the ranks of our vile foe."
SON_red_terror:0 "Unleash The Red Terror"
SON_red_terror_desc:0 "A true revolution does not simply replace one government with another. A tree cannot be fully removed by just cutting it down, it must be entirely uprooted. In a similar fashion, society will need to be thoroughly cleansed of unwanted elements for the revolution to be successful."
SON_raid_armories:0 "Raid The Armouries"
SON_raid_armories_desc:0 "The peasants are armed with everything they can find - not just scavenged or stolen guns, but even their tools and hunting weapons. Yet even then, it is not enough.

SON_seek_support:0 "Seek Support From Ideological Sympathisers"
SON_seek_support_desc:0 "Communism is an international movement. Even if it takes many different forms, every creature is ultimately united by the ideal of an equal society.

SON_sway_merchants:0 "Sway The Merchants"
SON_sway_merchants_desc:0 "While the merchants in Zar-Hay exist outside the caste system, they have nevertheless accumulated great wealth, and zebras in other regions of the Great Lakes have climbed high up the social ladder.

SON_forward_unto_modernity_desc:0 "The former rulers of Zar-Hay claimed to be modernizing the Great Lakes, but in truth were only implementing surface-level changes that did not bring true change to society.

SON_civilize_the_masses:0 "Civilize The Masses"
SON_civilize_the_masses_desc:0 "The old order was maintained by the ignorant majority of the population. True modernity requires elevation of consciousness, not just in terms of class awareness. For this purpose, educational infrastructure is needed. Zaberi Ganji has contacts in Timbucktu and is eager to manage its establishment."

SON_unshackled_trade:0 "Unshackled Trade"
SON_unshackled_trade_desc:0 "If we want to be part of the modern world, then we must establish connections with it. Free and unimpeded flow of goods across the border will bring greater prosperity to all of the Great Lakes.

SON_acquire_machinery_at_any_cost_desc:0 "Production levels still lag behind more developed countries. To catch up, much more industrial machinery is needed, but not enough can be made domestically.

SON_equality_proclamation:0 "The Equality Proclamation"
SON_equality_proclamation_desc:0 "This has been Nyaberi's dream since foalhood: the end of castes, the end of stratified society, the end of unjust birthrights.

SON_the_new_generation:0 "A New Generation Of Officers"
SON_the_new_generation_desc:0 "The former leadership of the army of Zar-Hay comprised of aristocrats and loyalists to the old order. That army is now gone, and a new one will rise from its ashes, led by young and innovative zebras who have humble backgrounds. Each of them will be promoted based on talent and their undying loyalty to Nyaberi Zargey."
SON_state_steel_company:0 "The Duty Of The State"
SON_state_steel_company_desc:0 "The economy of the Great Lakes is so backwards that there aren't even any companies that could be nationalized. To modernize and better organize the economy, state-owned companies will need to be established. The first and foremost one will be the Great Lakes Steelmaking Company, bringing all steel production in the region under its control."
SON_agricultural_mechanization:0 "The Green Revolution"
SON_agricultural_mechanization_desc:0 "Vast majority of the population of the Great Lakes is employed in the agricultural sector.

SON_urbanization_desc:0 "With increased automation, many zebras in the countryside are left without work. They can now be relocated to urban centers to work in factories and provide services.

SON_wings_of_steel:0 "Wings Of Steel"
SON_wings_of_steel_desc:0 "Uncivilized zebras can only dream about flying, but advanced nations can make it a reality. A modern aerodrome will be constructed in Zano, an air force founded as part of the military, and a state-owned commission established to organize production of aircraft. Nothing will be beyond the reach of our revolution."
SON_avalanche_of_steel:0 "The Roar Of Engines"
SON_avalanche_of_steel_desc:0 "Wars are no longer won by masses of infantry, but by an overwhelming amount of machines armed with the latest weaponry. As such, it is vital that the nation develops a capability to produce them and train the soldiers of the Revolutionary Army to use them."
SON_coca_cola_2:0 "The Drink Of The Proletariat"
SON_coca_cola_2_desc:0 "Alcohol is poison, there is no doubt about that. As a healthier alternative, a war veteran zebra has proposed a carbonated soft drink made from kola nuts. Nyaberi has personally approved of its flavour, so the state will acquire the patent for the drink and begin its mass production. Bright red bottles will hopefully encourage the workers to drink it."

SON_cult_of_the_machine_desc:0 "The world has been transformed into a single, monstrous fantastic perpetually moving machine, into a single huge non-animal automatic organism.

SON_our_former_benefactors:0 "Our Former Benefactors"
SON_our_former_benefactors_desc:0 "The Re'emites previously provided some support to our movement, albeit they did so in secret. They wanted us to overthrow the regime that ruled over the Great Lakes, and we did so. Yet for some reason, they thought we wouldn't overthrow their own government in return. Their lands are highly developed and would make a fine addition to the state."
SON_kill_czr:0 "Liberate The East"

SON_lingua_franca:0 "A Common Language"
SON_lingua_franca_desc:0 "There are hundreds of languages spoken in the Great Lakes, but to facilitate exchange of information, various trade tongues have traditionally been used. One of them, Mazwian, reached widespread usage during the rule of the Imperial Mazwi. By making it an official state language that is taught in schools, we will unite the disparate peoples of the Great Lakes."
SON_kill_yeti_com:0 "Liberate The South"
SON_kill_yeti_com_desc:0 "The despicable yeti are inherently reactionary, backwards and violent. They can never be trusted after what they did to half of Zebrica. As such, they must be crushed before it is too late. The zebras of the south yearn for freedom, and we shall give it to them."
SON_country_roads:0 "Speeding Towards The Future"
SON_country_roads_desc:0 "Roads of dirt or gravel are not sufficient for motor vehicles. Paved asphalt roads are needed, crossing the country and connecting all major settlements.

SON_kill_mgy:0 "Secure The Neighle"
SON_kill_mgy_desc:0 "Much of the Neighle river is already under our control, except for the most important part: its estuary.

SON_com_navy_crap:0 "A Navy Of Two Seas"
SON_com_navy_crap_desc:0 "With the perfectly justified seizure of Maregypt, the state now spans from one sea to another. This will require the foundation of two fleets under one navy, so both coasts can be guarded. Not only that, but it is vital to secure the trade routes and overseas connections to the advanced nations of the world."
SON_rocket_shit:0 "Pierce The Skies"
SON_rocket_shit_desc:0 "It was once believed that the Sky Stallion resided above the clouds. If this is true, then he will be very surprised when the latest technological marvels, high-velocity rockets, rise far above the clouds and into the upper stratosphere. Eventually, these rockets will allow us to travel beyond our planet, but for now they function perfectly as long-range weapons."
SON_abyssinian_question:0 "The Abyssinian Question"
SON_abyssinian_question_desc:0 "Abyssinia is a land rich in resources yet prone to mismanaged exploitation by the current owners.

SON_withering_away:0 "Withering Away Of The State"
SON_withering_away_desc:0 ""The interference of the state power in social relations becomes superfluous in one sphere after another, and then ceases of itself.

We can no longer allow foreign traders to take advantage of the precious labour of the working class!"
SON_collectivization:0 "End Private Ownership"
SON_collectivization_desc:0 "Nyaberi's government never explicitly banned private ownership, despite transfering most property to state-owned companies. Nationalization is not enough: we must proceed with the socialization of the economy. It is vital that surplus product is distributed fairly to the workers and that workplace hierarchies are swiftly eroded."
SON_eat_the_rich:0 "Butcher The Bourgeoisie"
SON_eat_the_rich_desc:0 "Nyaberi was unable to set her personal biases aside and thus spared her relatives who were merchants. We will not be so merciful. As Marks wrote: "there is only one way in which the murderous death agonies of the old society and the bloody birth throes of the new society can be shortened, simplified and concentrated, and that way is revolutionary terror.""
SON_rational_management:0 "Rational Management"
SON_rational_management_desc:0 "A truly modern economy does not rely on the market to decide the worth of commodities and individuals, but on calculation based on labour theory of value. Hard work will be rewarded, allowing exceptional persons to thrive, while others still get everything they need to live a comfortable life."
SON_free_public_services:0 "Free Public Services"
SON_free_public_services_desc:0 "For now, the state must exist for the simple reason of redistributing surplus value to those who need it most - the sick, the young, the disabled and the elderly. Only a society that takes care of all its members can truly prosper."
SON_scientific_socialism:0 "Scientific Socialism"
SON_scientific_socialism_desc:0 "A government that gains its sovereignty not through force or monopoly on violence, but through reason, justice, and equality, its a truly advanced government. As such, the peak of the intellectual development of a society is scientific socialism, which we must now seek to implement."
SON_proletarian_democracy:0 "Proletarian Democracy"
SON_proletarian_democracy_desc:0 "True democracy abolishes hierarchy in the workplace and sees communism as the true embodiment of itself. As Marks did not outline the exact form of a revolutionary society, we must democratically decide it ourselves, allowing history to take its natural course."
SON_state_atheism:0 "The Soul Of Soulless Conditions"
SON_state_atheism_desc:0 "Marks famously called religion "the opium of the masses", and she was right about it. Religion is a coping mechanism of the poor, and a tool of the rich used to oppress them. All temples shall be torn down or repurposed. Illusory happiness of the people will be replaced with real happiness."
SON_path_to_pure_communism:0 "The Path To Pure Communism"
SON_path_to_pure_communism_desc:0 "With full automation of all means of production, public ownership can be replaced with common ownership, allowing communism to crystallize and form naturally. With a superabundance of goods, everything can be freely distributed based on the need of individuals. A true utopia of sapient flourishing finally becomes possible."

SON_trollge:0 "The Real Revolution"
SON_trollge_desc:0 "Nyaberi's ultimate goal of bringing modernity to the Great Lakes is finally within reach. All the hard work and sacrifices over the years are finally going to pay off, and they're going to pay off big. Soon, everyzebra can become rich beyond their wildest dreams. All they have to do is accept the changes that are taking place."
SON_shareholder_principle:0 "The Shareholder Principle"
SON_shareholder_principle_desc:0 "As there is no state, there is no such thing as citizenship. However, companies are offering shares at a cheap price which provide similar privileges, as shareholders will be able to vote on any decisions made in the company. Of course, there is no limit to how many shares an individual can purchase. Why would there be?"
SON_corporate_security_forces:0 "Corporate Security Forces"
SON_corporate_security_forces_desc:0 "With the Revolutionary Army and the Guardians Of The Revolution no longer having an owner, they are being auctioned off to the highest bidder. Most of such bidders are the companies that now dominate the entire Neighle basin, who are in desperate need of security for their assets. The soldiers and officers will be happy to know their salaries will rise dramatically."
SON_great_neighle_dam:0 "The Great Neighle Dam"
SON_great_neighle_dam_desc:0 "Damming the Neighle river might sound like an insane idea, but what is truly insane is the amount of energy that could potentially be produced. Sure, it will create a large reservoir which will force thousands to migrate and deprive the Maregyptian flood plains downstream of water, but it will also make electricity dirt cheap, so it's worth it."
SON_coffee_plantations:0 "Abyssinian Coffee Plantations"
SON_coffee_plantations_desc:0 "The newly established CatCofCom (Cat Coffee Company) is quickly becoming one of the leading producers of coffee in the world thanks to acquiring Abyssinian land and labourers at a cheap price and utilizing it to produce tonnes of coffee, both for export and domestic consumption. Nyaberi is now personally investing into the company. Wonder why..."
SON_port_of_rataphet:0 "Expand R'ataphet Harbour"
SON_port_of_rataphet_desc:0 "The city of R'ataphet, located in the Neighle delta, is our gateway to the wider world. It is vital to expand its port facilities to facilitate ever increasing amounts of international trade. It will also become a fine base for the company commerce protection fleets. Once the locals see the benefits of corporate rule, they will happily embrace it."
SON_striving_for_perfect_competition:0 "Striving For Perfect Competition"
SON_striving_for_perfect_competition_desc:0 "Modernity is driven by innovation, which is driven by competition, which is driven by scarcity. A society where everyone gets what they need to survive is a stagnant one. We must never stop striving for ideal market conditions, even if they are never actually reached, so we can maximise allocative and productive efficiency."
SON_moar_land:0 "Forceful Land Acquisition"
SON_moar_land_desc:0 "With economic long-term strategy in mind, it is vital to gain access to the Arabian Sea and secure control of the rivers which flow down from Abyssinia. Using corporate security forces to seize the vital natural harbors of Assur, Farasrah and Mane'a will be worth all the expenses."
SON_good_guys:0 "We Care About Our Employees"
SON_good_guys_desc:0 "Our employees stand at the very heart of our success – they devote their ideas, creativity, knowledge and entrepreneurial spirit to ensuring that we can do our very best for our customers. We support and nurture them through targeted, customised professional development, a good work-life balance and a corporate culture focused on involvement and mutual respect."
SON_efficient_guys:0 "Work Smarter, Not Harder"
SON_efficient_guys_desc:0 "Good performance at work should be rewarded, while laziness, inefficiency, corruption and so on should be punished. Not only that, but companies should seek to incentivize constant innovation if they want to prevail in the new business environment. In an ideal modern society, only the best of the best should thrive. The rest? Well, we don't care, frankly."
SON_bad_guys:0 "In Pursuit Of Profit"
SON_bad_guys_desc:0 "Let's be honest here for once, we don't give a buck about the employees or anyone else. We only care about one thing: profit. Sweet, ambrosian, shining profit. To cook an omelette, you have to break a few eggs. But we are cooking the mother of all omelettes here, so we'll have to break a lot of eggs. But that is a sacrifice we are willing to make."
SON_a_bright_future:0 "A Bright Future"
SON_a_bright_future_desc:0 "There is no doubt that company rule has led to the beginning of a new golden age, far more resplendent than the despotic reigns of Zar-Hay or Mazwi. We are finally considered one of the most wealthy and advanced nations in the world, even without a state to run things. Perhaps the rest of the world will follow our example and tear down useless governments."

SON_reemite_support_decisions_category:0 "Re'emite Support"
SON_reemite_support_decisions_category_desc:0 "Zonni Zolon proclaimed himself to be the protector of Re'em and expected something in return from the Re'emites. However, they are only willing to aid Zar-Hay if they support our cause. Thus, [Root.GetLeader] needs to do what he can to appease them and avoid actions that may upset them.\n\nCurrently, Re'emite support is [Root.SON_reemite_support_dynamic_loc].\n\nSecuring control of §gRe'emite enclave§! states and militarily aiding Re'em will increase support, while committing §Rimmoral acts§! will decrease support."
SON_support_reem:0 "Send Warriors To Re'em"
SON_support_reem_desc:0 "Re'em is a small country and could always benefit from having more soldiers in its army. They have the guns, so we can provide the warriors. This way, we show we are eager to defend Re'em. Convincing the chieftains to send their zebras abroad is not easy, however, and requires persuasion."
SON_literacy_program:0 "Re'emite Literacy Program"
SON_literacy_program_desc:0 "The Re'emites are literate folk, with the secrets of reading being widely known in their nation. We can request them to launch literacy programs in Zar-Hay to share their secrets with our subjects. A literate populace is a more capable and productive populace, after all."
SON_improve_science_base:0 "Invite Re'emite Experts"
SON_improve_science_base_desc:0 "Re'emites are known for their intellectual traditions. While scholars can't always be trusted, foreign educated experts could share their wisdom with Zar-Hay zebras and improve society as a whole. Or they could just help the gunsmiths make better weapons."
SON_improve_society:0 "Re'emite Development Aid"
SON_improve_society_desc:0 "Zar-Hay was once a prosperous nation, but decades of Mazwian occupation have drained the nation's wealth, and the Storm King only made things worse. Now our nation is backwards, but with the help of the Re'emites, Zar-Hay society may develop and slowly begin to industrialize."
SON_alleviate_poverty:0 "Re'emite Poverty Relief"
SON_alleviate_poverty_desc:0 "Many free farmers and artisans have been struggling to make ends meet due to economic instability in the Great Lakes. While our economy recovers, the Re'emites can provide emergency aid to those in need, hopefully enough so they can get back on their hooves."
SON_recover_from_storm:0 "Re'emite Reconstruction Committee"
SON_recover_from_storm_desc:0 "The Storm King ravaged half of Zebrica, including Zar-Hay and Re'em. While both countries suffered, Re'em can more quickly recover with their more developed nation. Zar-Hay, however, could benefit greatly from their help. While lost artifacts may never be recovered, what was destroyed can now be rebuilt."
SON_build_railway:0 "Build The Zombori-Zao Railway"
SON_build_railway_desc:0 "Re'emites have already mastered the art of constructing railways to connect their towns and cities. Trains can carry much more cargo than zebras can on their backs. Cooperating with Re'em, a new railroad could be built to connect Zao with the Re'emite realm, bringing our two countries closer and allowing our people to easily travel between the two countries."
SON_relinquish_claim:0 "Relinquish Claim On Zombori"
SON_relinquish_claim_desc:0 "Before the Mazwian conquest, Zar-Hay ruled over the lands of Zombori which are now part of Re'em. The area has a significant population of Zar-Hay zebras, but after several centuries they are largely assimilated into Re'emite religion and culture. To improve relations between the two nations, it has been proposed that any claims on Zombori should be abandoned. Doing so would be controversial, but no doubt effective."
SON_secure_enclave:0 "Secure A Re'emite Enclave"
SON_secure_enclave_desc:0 "Our brave and valiant warriors have defeated the enemy and seized land which includes a Re'emite enclave. By formally offering protection and local autonomy to this enclave, we will earn the favour of Re'em and further solidify our status as the protectors of Re'emites."

SON_expand_admin_to_CZR:0 "Integrate Zwadai"
SON_expand_admin_to_CZR_desc:0 "The newly taken lands to the east were formerly part of Alwani. Thus, for historical and geographical reasons, it would be best to assign the eastern provinces of Zwadai into the jurisdiction of Zubia."
SON_hyena_autonomy:0 "Grant Autonomy To Hyenas"
SON_hyena_autonomy_desc:0 "Hyenan culture and administrative structure are alien to Zar-Hay, and local resistance to foreign rule is strong. Full integration thus seems impossible. However, thanks to policies of religious pluralism, it would be easy to establish autonomous theocratic states governed by hoof-picked Qaylidi individuals. This would help maintain order in the region."
SON_integrate_zwahile:0 "Integrate The Zwahile Coast"
SON_integrate_zwahile_desc:0 "The zebras of the south once lived under Mazwi's dominion like Zar-Hay did.

SON_establish_yeti_protectorate:0 "Establish The Yeti Protectorate"
SON_establish_yeti_protectorate_desc:0 "The savage yeti of the south have been subjugated, but not truly pacified.

Копья и стрелы обычно имеют наконечники из хорошо заточенного кованого железа, дабы эффективно пробивать наиболее часто используемую защиту — стёганые доспехи и деревянные щиты.

Это переходное оружие было довольно грубым, поскольку местные кузнецы ещё только осваивали процесс нарезки стволов и создания конических полых пуль, которые делали винтовки эффективнее мушкетов."

This made Timbucktu the first place in the Great Lakes that was self-reliant in weapons, albeit the rate of production was limited. The rifle design that spread across the region was named "Harmattan" after the harsh eastern desert wind of the dry season, a regular phenomenon in Timbucktu and northern Great Lakes in general."

The most popular domestically produced assault rifle model was a weapon that had little to no influences from the older generations of weapons. As such, it resembled a foreign pony or griffon rifle more than anything. The weapon had larger clips, better rate of fire, higher accuracy, improved reliability... yet when soldiers held it in their hooves, they felt like they were holding a foreign import."

Compared to AR 19, it has a high-capacity magazine, improved metallurgical quality of the barrel and a better gun sight. Aesthetics have also been taken into account, with sleek ivory-coloured plastic casing. With this weapon, the Great Lakes will remain united forever. Shall we sign the contract?"

zarhay.1.t:0 "The Chiefs Arrive"
zarhay.1.d:0 "Chief Quaggo arrived at the capital of Zao accompanied by his retinue of advisors and servants. He comfortably lied on his palanquin as his slaves carried it through the busy streets of the capital. He was not the only chief in town, clearly, as he saw many other chiefs and their entourages on his way to the Royal Palace.\n\nAfter they arrived, Quaggo got down from his seat and ordered his servants to do what he had told them to do earlier. The courtyard of the palace, located on the shore of Lake Zao, was filled with the many chiefs of Zar-Hay who were all chattering with one another. Soon enough, Quaggo himself would chatter as he saw his good friend, Chieftess Amzina. They exchanged formal pleasantries before engaging in more serious discussion.\n"What do you think the Regent is up to?" Quaggo asked from the mare adorned in gold.\n"He'll gather us in a room so he can kill us all at once, then seize total control," Amzina said with a smirk.\nQuaggo narrowed his eyes. "Very funny. I wanted to have a serious talk with you."\n"Fine then. To be honest, I'm not sure what to expect. One way or another, he will want to secure his rule."\n"I suppose we shall see. Earlier, I told my servants to do some investigating, just in case Zonni is plotting something God-forsaken."\n"You're being paranoid, silly. As always."\n"How can we trust him? He is half-Mazwian."\nAmzina rolled her eyes. "Let's just go to the meeting and see what happens, alright?""
zarhay.1.a:0 "Wonder what he's up to?"

zarhay.2.t:0 "Zonni's Dream"
zarhay.2.d:0 "A royal slave came out of the palace, beating a djembe drum with his hoof. The chiefs in the courtyard went silent and turned to look. Then Zonni appeared, eyeing at the crowd of chiefs closely, as if he was trying to read their thoughts, and walked up to a raised dais in front of the palace. There was a golden seat on it, but only Kings and Queens could sit there, so Zonni simply stood alongside it. He then addressed the gathered aristocrats.\n\n"Esteemed chiefs of Zar-Hay! I have summoned you here for a good reason. I have a dream, and to fulfill it, I need your unquestionable loyalty. It is not just any dream, but a dream of making Zar-Hay a truly mighty Kingdom! Long have we been subjugated, treated like slaves no matter what caste we belonged to, extorted and robbed by foreigners. We have lost our glory, our wealth and even our royalty. All this is disheartening, but I refuse to be disheartened! We should not simply sit idly as a golden opportunity presents itself. The Sky Stallion has paved the way to redeem ourselves; all we must do is walk down this sacred path. That is what I intend to do.\n\nThe Mazwian Empire has collapsed. The Storm King is no more. Now there is a power vacuum in the Great Lakes, which lies fractured and weak. Now is our chance to strike with our warriors, to forge a mighty empire surpassing Mazwi in its glory. This way, the Zar-Hay will no longer be slaves, but masters forever!"\n\nThe chiefs looked at each other quietly. Then, one of them began stomping the ground with their hooves. This began to spread as more and more chiefs showed their support for Zonni and his dream. In the end, even sceptics like Quaggo couldn't help but follow the herd and do the same.\n\nWhen Zonni saw this, he grinned. Finally, the chiefs were on his side."
zarhay.2.a:0 "We shall become great!"

zarhay.3.t:0 "A Wandering Warrior"
zarhay.3.d:0 "It seemed word of Zonni's ambitions had spread quickly, because a warrior claiming to come from a distant land requested audience with the Regent. Zonni, always in need of capable soldiers, agreed to meet him.\n\nThe warrior introduced himself as Ture Sylla and said he had fought under many rulers over the years in return for pay. Now he offered his experience and skill to Zonni, because he believed he would be victorious in the coming wars of unification, and wanted to be on the winning side.\n\nZonni was very tempted by this offer, but he wondered what the chiefs would think if he allowed a foreigner to lead their troops into battle? Perhaps it wasn't worthwhile, as he didn't want to lose their trust. Then again, a competent leader like Ture Sylla was just what he needed to aid him in his conquests."
zarhay.3.a:0 "He will be useful to us."
zarhay.3.b:0 "We have no need for him."

zarhay.4.t:0 "Ancestral Shame"
zarhay.4.d:0 "The speech had been successful and Zonni had gained the loyalty of the chiefs. As long as he would lead the army into battle to subjugate Zar-Hay's neighbours, the chiefs were willing to support him.\n\nAfter the feast following the meeting, Zonni left the city proper and travelled alone to a large field. There were many grassy mounds there, where the Kings and Queens and mighty chiefs lied entombed forever. He walked past them, to the burial ground of lesser chiefs, to the grave of his late father.\n\nHe sat on the ground and mumbled a quiet prayer to his ancestors, then began to speak to his father.\n"It appears as if I have finally gained their trust, father. But I know I have not. They are merely giving me another chance to prove that I truly am a Zar-Hay. But it is ridiculous, is it not? I had to promise so much to gain so little. And even if I succeed, will they accept me? Or will they still reject me, refusing to trust me because of my mother?"\nHe let out a deep sigh. "Sometimes I wonder why you married a Mazwian mare. It has brought our family nothing but shame and trouble. Perhaps it was just blind, foolish love. Or a gamble, which would've paid off had the Mazwian Empire not utterly collapsed. Either way, I do not judge you, father. I just wish I knew why, that is all."\nThere was a gust of wind. His father was answering, but he wasn't sure he understood. Perhaps his father was ashamed to tell the full truth?\n"I apologize for my curiosity. Don't feel pressured to answer. I will still love you, father, no matter what happens. And I promise to you, I will restore our family's lost honour. I will bring judgement upon our enemies. Our family won't have petty chiefs anymore but... an Emperor."\nWind howled in the darkness as the sun set. Zonni took this as a warning. "I will be careful, don't worry. I am no weakling anymore. Once I have gained total victory, I will return. I promise."\nHe humbly prostrated himself before the grave, and the wind calmed, becoming a pleasant breeze."
zarhay.4.a:0 "Once I come back, I will be a true Zar-Hay."

zarhay.5.t:0 "The Praise-Singers"
zarhay.5.d:0 "Fassa Balleke was a famed griot, whose ancestors had been in the court of the Zar-Hay monarch. But ever since the Mazwian invasion, they had lived in exile, wandering the land and entertaining countless chiefs and petty kings. When the Regent of Zar-Hay offered her a position in his court, she was at first sceptical, as griots traditionally served rulers, not mere regents. But in these tumultuous times, she couldn't simply refuse a job offer like that.\n\nWhen she arrived at the Royal Palace, she quickly realized she wasn't the only griot who had been invited there. Some of the griots she recognized, yet others appeared obscure and unpopular. The Regent had cast a very wide net in his search for griots.\n\nThen Zonni came out to meet them. "Greetings, honoured griots, and welcome to the Royal Palace! These walls have not heard your music or song in so many years, yet this shall now change. I know some of you may be wondering why a mere Regent would have a need for you. No, I do not intend to become King. However, I do need your aid. You see, I need popular support for my grand unification campaigns which I have planned. I need talented speakers and entertainers like you to spread the word among the commoners, glorifying my rule, drumming up support for my cause and recording my deeds for the future generations. In return, I will offer you a generous share of the spoils of war. I swear on the Spirits that you will become rich."\n\nTo some it might have seemed like an unpleasant job, but for Fassa it was nothing out of the ordinary. Such was the usual duty of the griot caste. However, in her heart she feared that the Regent's gamble would fail, that he would be defeated and his griots enslaved. But as she looked around the Palace, she felt like she was finally back home. She prayed to God, and stepped forth to accept Zonni as her new patron."
zarhay.5.a:0 "Our fates are now entwined."

zarhay.6.t:0 "The Wind-Singers"
zarhay.6.d:0 "Zonni uncovered his head as he entered a hallowed sanctuary of the Wind-Singers. The white-robed priests inside nodded in greeting. "We have expected you, scion of Zolon," the eldest of the priests said.\nZonni raised an eyebrow. "How? I did not inform you of my arrival."\n"The Spirits told us. They also said you've come to see the future."\n"Yes. If the Spirits told you that, then clearly I can trust you to conduct a divination and reveal my fate to me."\nOne of the other priests shook her head. "Fate is fickle. Visions are unclear. Future is always in flux."\n"The further away we look, the harder it becomes to see," the eldest priest added. "But perhaps the Spirits are in a generous mood today."\n"I pray it is so," Zonni replied. "Please, tell me if my dream is doomed to fail, if I should bother waging war in the first place. That is all I wish to know."\nThe priests looked at one another, then nodded. "Then come, to conduct a proper divination we must do so in the open," the eldest said.\n\nThe zebras left the sanctuary and walked to a nearby open field. They spread out a pure white cloth with painted markings and symbols on the grass. One of the priests had brought with him a pouch, which he gave to the eldest Wind-Singer. The priests stood and waited for the wind to pick up, and when there was a gust of wind, the priests hummed and the eldest one threw out the contents of the pouch into the wind. Bone fragments, gemstones, amulets and carved dice were scattered by the wind onto the cloth. As the wind died down, so did the humming of the priests. The eldest one then sat down in front of the cloth and began to study the pattern created by the objects.\n"What do you see, elder?" Zonni asked, curious and eager.\nThe eldest furrowed his brow. "I see... a dead lion," he said and pointed at several items on the cloth. "And a white-backed vulture, swooping in to feast on its flesh."\nZonni's eyes widened. "I see what this means. The lion is Mazwi and I am the vulture!"\nThe eldest narrowed his eyes. "But then a hidden hunter appears from the bush and scares the vulture away, claiming the lion's remains."\nZonni frowned. "Hrm. Sounds like I need to be careful, or I will lose it all."\n"You are interpreting the signs well enough," the eldest said. "But remember what was said. The future is not set in stone. The vulture may yet feast on the lion."\nZonni nodded, and smiled confidently."
zarhay.6.a:0 "It is a good sign, thank God."

zarhay.7.t:0 "New Tools Of Death"
zarhay.7.d:0 "Gunsmiths were among the most respected members of the artisan caste, capable of assembling intricate weaponry from metal. Before, they had made fine swords of steel, but in recent decades they had learned to make muskets instead. In this time of rapid change, they would have to adapt yet again.\n\nZonni entered the courtyard of the gunsmith's workshop, where the local guild masters and their students were already waiting. On his back, Zonni carried a weapon which immediately attracted the attention of the smiths. He stopped in front of the audience members, who bowed in respect, and took out the gun. "Greetings, esteemed gunsmiths. Do any of you know what this is?"\nThe gunsmiths looked at each other in doubt. "Is it some kind of musket?" one of them asked.\nZonni chuckled. "Almost correct. This, my friends, is a rifle. Allow me to demonstrate how it works." He motioned to his servants who brought out a blindfolded female prisoner into the courtyard, guiding it to stand in front of a mudbrick wall. It was a slave who had tried to kill its owner and had thus been condemned to death.\n\nZonni stood up on his hind legs, loaded the rifle, took aim and fired. A loud bang echoed in the courtyard as the slave dropped dead in an instant. The gunsmiths looked in awe, their mouths wide open. Zonni smiled as he turned to face them again. "As you can see, it is far more accurate than a musket and produces less smoke. I have spent a fortune acquiring these from a dealer in Tobuck. Your task will be to dismantle and study this weapon, so we may learn to make it ourselves. I trust you will do a fine job in service to the Kingdom, and receive a handsome reward in return." Zonni gave the rifle to the nearest gunsmith, who prostrated herself on the ground, deeply grateful."
zarhay.7.a:0 "May God bless these weapons."

zarhay.8.t:0 "Zonni Zolon Vows To Protect Re'emites"
zarhay.8.d:0 "In a strange turn of events, Zonni Zolon, the Regent of the Kingdom of Zar-Hay, has sworn to protect Re'emites from any outside aggression. This pledge of protection extends to any Re'emite minorities living within territory under Zar-Hay control.\n\nHowever, he was quick to make it clear that he is not doing this out of the goodness of his heart, and said Re'em would have to provide his nation aid in return. This help did not have to be military in nature, as Re'em could help develop the underdeveloped country in return and work to eliminate poverty. [Root.GetLeader] has accepted this, as Re'em has already done much to aid the zebras of the Great Lakes. Besides, if Zonni grows stronger, he will be a powerful ally for Re'em, ensuring its survival in the future."
zarhay.8.a:0 "Thank you..?"

zarhay.9.t:0 "A Worthy Sacrifice"
zarhay.9.d:0 "Zonni had ordered a sacrificial ceremony to be held by the priesthood of Zao in preparation for the wars he was about to wage. The Wind-Singers got to work and Zonni assumed he did not need to get involved himself. However, one of the priests approached him and requested him to decide what would be sacrificed. Traditionally, it had been the decision of the Kings and Queens, but as Zonni was the royal regent, the responsibility was now on his shoulders.\n\nZonni pondered deeply, for the decision was vital. If the right sacrifice was not made, the spirits would be displeased and cast a curse on him. On the other hoof, if he chose correctly, then the spirits would bless his ambitions and further ensure he'd prevail on the battlefield. The most important spirits to appease were Zabera, grandfather of war, Muawri, god of the hunt, and Zargitau, the founder of Zao and the progenitor of Zar-Hay. The custom offering consisted of fresh kola nuts, divided into four lobes. Zabera was known to be especially fond of the bittersweet seeds. But Zonni was unsure if this was a fitting sacrifice, as the coming wars weren't a mere skirmish or raid, and possibly required a greater sacrifice. Dogs were favourite animals of Zargitau and close companions of Muawri, so they'd be pleased by such a offering. Yet even this did not feel like enough. Perhaps a grand sacrifice was in place, to truly impress the spirits and show them that Zonni was in great need of their blessing? For that, 444 slaves would suffice. It was a sacred number and ritual killings of slaves were acceptable in Zar-Hay society. But perhaps it was too much...\n\nEventually, Zonni finally made the decision and revealed it to the Wind-Singers."
zarhay.9.a:0 "Offer kola nuts."
zarhay.9.b:0 "Offer the life of a dog."
zarhay.9.c:0 "Offer the lives of 444 slaves."

zarhay.10.t:0 "Gathering The Warriors"
zarhay.10.d:0 "As far as Zonni was concerned, every capable zebra in the Kingdom was a potential soldier. As the clouds of war were gathering, so too would the levied troops of Zar-Hay. They would provide crucial support for the more professional royal retinue and the chieftains' personal armies. Zonni had done much work in preparation to organize the mustering of soldiers, hiring administrators, establishing a regional command hierarchy and bribing the right zebras to ensure it would go smoothly. He was not inventing everything new, of course, just renovating the old levy system of the Kingdom that had not been used since before the Mazwians had ended their independence centuries ago.\n\nSoon, the war drums were beaten across the nation and zebras were called to arms. Many began gathering in the centers of their towns and villages where Zonni's commanders were overseeing the mustering. Each zebra brought their own equipment and rations, many armed with crude muskets, swords, spears or bows. Units were formed and the conscripts were assigned officers from the ranks of the aristocracy. Then these units would march to Zao, where the levies would swear allegiance to the Regent.\n\nZonni was proud to see thousands of soldiers gathering in the capital. The mustering had gone well, and while many villages had now lost able-bodied workers, they'd be back home eventually. Dead or alive. What mattered to Zonni was that his army was now strong enough to face the challenges ahead of them."
zarhay.10.a:0 "Soon, it begins..."

zarhay.11.t:0 "Righteous Flames"
zarhay.11.d:0 "The false prophet was escorted to a stake by Zonni's warriors. He was tied up to the wooden pole, next to his most dedicated followers who would share his fate. Unlike them, however, the prophet did not seem afraid. His face was emotionless, his eyes determined. This stallion did not fear death, it seemed.\n\nZonni approached him, looking at the fanatic with disdain. "Speak if you will, for soon you will no longer be able to do so."\n"I have nothing to say to you; but I ask God to forgive you for your sins, for you are misguided."\n"Misguided? You are the one who is misguided! You wished to force the zebras of the Great Lakes to all follow your ways of worship, regardless of their own traditions."\nThe prophet ignored him as he closed his eyes. "I have nothing to fear. The flames cannot hurt me. I am with God, and God is with me."\nThe Regent grimaced, almost in disgust. "If God was with you, then why did you lose?"\n\nHe received no response as the prophet continued to mumble his prayers. Zonni rolled his eyes and turned to his warriors, who were holding lit torches. "The time has come! Let us get rid of these lost souls. They are beyond redemption."\n\nThe soldiers nodded and ignited the piles of dry branches at the base of each stake. The fires spread quickly, engulfing the prophet and his followers. One by one, they each began screaming from pain, except for the prophet who was completely silent even as his coat began burning. But in the end, he too screamed and begged for Zonni's forgiveness. The Regent simply glared back. Now he was the one who refused to respond."
zarhay.11.a:0 "The head of the snake has been cut."

zarhay.12.t:0 "A Meeting In Zarabara"
zarhay.12.d:0 "As Zonni Zolon entered the dwelling of the chieftain, he was immediately met with pungent fumes that filled the air. One of Faran's servants advised him to cover his muzzle while he was inside, as the Chief had recently been brewing potions. The Regent did so and followed the servant as she guided him to the meeting chamber.\n\nThere, Faran was already waiting, seated on a cushion with a stoic face. Zonni sat down in front of him and the Chief offered him kola nuts, a traditional gift of hospitality. The Regent humbly accepted.\n"You know why I come here, so let us bypass the formalities. How can I convince you to provide your skills of sorcery in service to the Kingdom?"\nFaran said nothing, simply glaring at him. Zonni frowned and almost took it as an insult, before Faran suddenly burst into laughter. "He who asks, shall receive!"\nZonni blinked in confusion, then regained his composure. "Well, that is what I am doing now."\n"But what do you ask for? I have many skills that can be used in many ways. Are you in need of my potions, or my knowledge of the arcane?"\nZonni raised an eyebrow. "Can you not provide both?"\n"Do not be greedy, despite your status. You may ask for one thing, and you shall receive it. What will it be?" Faran grinned.\n\nThe Regent pondered for a while before answering. Faran's potions would be greatly useful, empowering the warriors of the army, but his abilities as a sorcerer could be used to instead empower the state. Part of him wanted to simply demand both, but even he did not dare to arouse the wrath of a zebra who could cast a curse to break his back."
zarhay.12.a:0 ""I am going to battle, and I want your strongest potions.""
zarhay.12.b:0 ""Curse my enemies and bless my allies, sorcerer!""

zarhay.13.t:0 "The Price Of Arrogance"
zarhay.13.d:0 "Soon after Zonni Zolon had marched into Timbucktu as a victor, the university of Timbucktu launched a smear campaign against him, likely funded by the city's merchants. Pamphlets were spread among the literate populace, exposing Zonni Zolon as an illiterate, half-Mazwian tyrant, claiming he also dabbled in forbidden sorcery.\n\nWhen Zonni heard of this, his blood began to boil. While the claim about him being a sorcerer was a lie, everything else was truth. The foolish scholars used the truth as a weapon, striking him where it hurt. As a result of the campaign, the populace of Timbucktu were encouraged to resist the foreign occupier and threaten the newly established peace in the region.\n\nZonni would not stand for this. No one could mock him without facing the consequences. In his fury, he ordered the teachers and professors of the university to be rounded up and imprisoned for inciting a revolt against him. The most prominent scholars would be tortured or executed, while the university's printing presses were to be shattered with hammers and the city's libraries burned with fire. The wealth of the merchants would be confiscated so they would become beggars, unable to fund any resistance. Zonni's faithful warriors obeyed and carried out his commands. A dark pillar of smoke soon rose from the heart of Timbucktu.\n\nIf they wanted him to be a monster, then he'd become one."
zarhay.13.a:0 "They get what they deserve."

zarhay.14.t:0 "The Purpose Of Oppression"
zarhay.14.d:0 "Chieftess Meynsata of the Zibiridugu tribe was above all a warrior, but even she had a code of honour. Therefore she treated prisoners of war well and was merciful upon the defeated. When Zonni Zolon launched his reprisals against the zebras of Timbucktu, Meynsata couldn't help but question his actions. Zonni was fond of her, so she was not afraid of potentially angering him.\n\nWhen Meynsata met with him and asked why he was so ruthless against the Timbucktuans, Zonni sighed and said he'd tell a story from his youth.\n"When I was a mere colt, I was weak and pathetic. Other foals saw my weakness and thus abused me, making fun of my mixed blood and trampling me with their hooves. When I told my parents about this, my Mazwian mother said that I should turn the other cheek so the Sky Stallion would see my moral superiority. Of course, that did nothing. When I returned with a bloodied muzzle, my Zar-Hay father told me to strike back with twice the fury. Even if I was weak, it did not matter. I had to show them that mistreating me would have consequences.\nSo I faced the bullies again, but when they mocked me I mocked them back, calling them sons and daughters of donkeys. They beat me, and I struck back. While I was weak, they saw I was no longer a pushover. Their bullying continued for a while until they realized that it wasn't worth it. Slowly, they even began to fear and respect me. No one has dared to bully me ever since.\nThis is why I strike back with twice the fury at anyone who mocks me or conspires against me. The bullies learned this, and now the Timbucktuans did, too."\n\nMeynsata nodded. While she still did not agree with his actions, she did understand the reasoning."
zarhay.14.a:0 "An eye for an eye..."

zarhay.15.t:0 "The King Of The North"
zarhay.15.d:0 "Zonni was in Zongola, seated on the throne of the King of Alwani. He looked down upon Euzegoar as he was brought before him in chains. The zebra's spirit was broken, yet Zonni could sense a tiny flame of defiance as Euzegoar glared at him. The Regent stood up.\n"Your majesty, it is unfortunate that I cannot let you go free, as your supporters are... hesitant to accept defeat. Therefore I have to deal with you to dissuade their resistance."\n"Such audacity," Euzegoar spat out. "First you subjugate my subjects, then you plan to commit regicide to secure your unjust rule?"\n"My rule is just, as I have secured it with the strength of my army. Mighty empires are forged with violence and their right to rule comes from victory. As for 'regicide', well, that would require you to still be a King, wouldn't it?"\nEuzegoar's face twisted in hatred. "Truly, you have Mazwian blood in your veins, as you are bent oppression and subjugation. Fine then, deal with me as you see fit. The Storm King would be proud of your lack of mercy."\nZonni narrowed his eyes. He felt an urge to behead him immediately with his sword, but at the same time he questioned if that was the right thing to do. Killing Euzegoar would create a martyr and possibly incite further resistance. Taking him as a hostage would just make him seem even more like a Mazwian, but what about being merciful? He could spare him on the condition that he would order his supporters to lay down their arms, and could further appease him by making him governor of the north. However, Zonni was unsure if he could truly trust Euzegoar. Perhaps it'd be best to simply kill him and be done with it."
zarhay.15.a:0 "Off with his head!"
zarhay.15.b:0 "Perhaps he can be of use."

zarhay.16.t:0 "Choosing A Governor"
zarhay.16.d_no_euzegoar:0 "The domain of Zar-Hay had expanded quickly. Some said too quickly. Yet Zonni cared little for the naysayers and knew that he had to establish effective governance of conquered lands to secure control over them. The annexation of Macigena had already brought dozens of additional chieftains into the ranks of the nation's aristocracy, and doing the same to the entire north would result in a decentralized administrative nightmare. No, instead, Zonni knew he'd unfortunately have to do what the Mazwians had done and assign a regional governor to manage local administration.\n\nWhile the officials did the necessary paperwork, Zonni had to decide who should receive the title of Zubia-Farma, governor of the north. It should be somezebra he could trust, who wouldn't revolt at the first sign of his weakness, but also a zebra who was competent enough to handle the management of such a large area. This narrowed down the list of potential candidates greatly, as Zonni did not trust many zebras.\n\nIn the end, he seriously considered only two possible candidates: One was Zogon, the drillmaster of the army and a former master of slaves, while the other was Chieftess Amzina, known for making her tribe prosper. Zogon was loyal beyond any doubt, but wasn't as competent of a manager as Amzina would be. Meanwhile Amzina's power and influence was already great, so empowering her even more was potentially a bad idea.\n\nAfter a while, Zonni made the final decision and hoped he would not regret it."

zarhay.17.d:0 "After Zonni's brave warriors had captured the Gelon-Zornu royalty, he had considered to simply take them hostage, as he had no interest in keeping them around as puppets like the Mazwians had. When Mazwi was weak, they had simply seized the opportunity to declare independence, so clearly they could not be trusted. Yet as the word spread, zebras in Zao began to talk how Zonni was now acting like a Mazwian, taking subjugated rulers hostage, drawing comparisons to what had happened to Zar-Hay's royal family. This made Zonni's blood boil as despite refusing to leave the Zefuwa alone, he was still being compared to the Mazwians. It's like the zebras refused to forget his heritage.\n\nIn a fit of anger, he changed his plans to a more brutal direction, to prove that he would not mimic the accursed Mazwians in any way. He would extinguish the Zefuwa dynasty, thus removing any threat of disloyalty from Gelon-Zornu. Yet he felt pity on the former Mai, Gounama, who was an old zebra. Therefore he decided to leave him alone, and instead get rid of his heirs, so when he'd die of age, no one would inherit his claims to the throne.\n\nAll of his sons, daughters, cousins and other close relatives were rounded up in a countrywide search. They were then brought to Zao, where Zonni ordered the preparation of a sacrificial ritual. He claimed the gods would be pleased with an offering of royal blood, though the Wind-Singers were sceptical. Nevertheless, they obeyed, and soon enough a grand ritual was held where every heir of the Zefuwa dynasty was sacrificed to the Spirits.\n\nIt was said Gounama mourned for seven days before passing away, his heart broken from shock and despair."
zarhay.17.a:0 "Good riddance."

zarhay.18.t:0 "The Pride Of Urbanites"
zarhay.18.d:0 "When Zonni heard that the defeated city-states of Hayzebland had delivered something resembling an ultimatum to him, he was baffled. Their lands had been seized, their so-called Queen had been vanquished, the Regent of Zar-Hay was their new overlord... and they thought they could not only bargain, but make demands? It was truly outrageous. Zonni immediately began preparations to raze the prosperous cities, but was stopped by his advisors, who suggested he should consider accepting the demands.\n\nChieftess Meynsata said that doing so would appease the city-states and ensure their loyalty, proving to everyone that Zonni had a merciful side as well. She said that while the city-states would be less exploitable due to an autonomous status, less effort would need to be made to quell local resistance.\n\nAs Zonni trusted Meynsata, he seriously considered doing what she asked. But in his heart burned a fire of vengeance, as he felt like he had been insulted. If he would not punish them, wouldn't that just encourage more zebras to insult him? It was a choice between rationality and emotion, and Zonni struggled to decide what to do."

zarhay.19.t:0 "Blessed Of Baru Koda"
zarhay.19.d:0 "With the south, Zonni faced the same problem as with the north: He needed a governor to lead the administration of the region. However, the northern region of Zubia was smaller, had less population and the only notable urban center was Timbucktu. The south was different. It was larger, had much more population, and many prosperous and influential cities. Any governor would have to be not only competent, but loyal, as a rebellious governor could easily use the vast resources of the region to organize a revolt. The south was also blessed by Baru Koda, the Spirit of millet, and thus only a worthy individual could rule the land in Her divine name.\n\nWhile Zonni considered Zogon and Amzina again, as he had before, he also thought of another option. Through his Re'emite contacts, he learned of a royal prince of Ugabi known as Amanyi. He had studied soil chemistry in Re'em for many years and did not care much for being a ruler, lacking any ambition. When Zonni learned of this, he immediately sent his most loyal zebras of the royal retinue to find and retrieve Amanyi, as he felt like he could be the perfect governor.\n\nEventually, the prince was brought before Zonni and made kneel before him.\n"Prince Amanyi, it is good to see you in one piece! I was afraid you'd resist my warriors, but it seems you are willing to comply when necessary."\nAmanyi stood back up, but did not lift his head much and sighed. "Indeed. What do you want from me? Have I committed some crime?"\nZonni laughed. "No, no, you've done nothing wrong! But you can do many things right. You see, I am in need of a capable zebra who can govern your homeland in my stead. And you would fulfill this duty admirably, I believe."\nAmanyi seemed hesitant. "While... I am honoured by this offer, I do not share your belief. I am a student first and foremost. Besides, I would rather live as a free zebra than as a servant to a foreign conqueror."\nZonni's smile vanished. "I see. In that case, I have other options for the position as well. Governors who will make sure Ugabi is drained out of anything valuable."\nAmanyi remained silent. He knew Zonni's ghastly reputation. If he refused the offer, Ugabians would suffer. Would he accept a life of servitude for the sake of his homeland?"

zarhay.20.t:0 "The Results Of The Search"
zarhay.20.d:0 "After a month of investigation, where Zonni's warriors looked in every possible hiding place and interrogated countless Mazwians, no members of the Zughe dynasty were found. There were few clues about their fate: After the Storm King had sacked Ziani, any captives in the Imperial Palace had broken free. It is known that King Euzegoar of Alwani had escaped this way. However, some of the captives were recaptured and even slain by Mazwian guards. A mass grave of killed prisoners was found, containing only bleached bones and tattered rags, but there was no evidence that any of them had been part of the Zughe dynasty.\n\nThere was no sign of the Royal Signet Ring either. It was a golden heirloom of the Zar-Hay monarchy that functioned both as a seal for the authentification of documents and as a way to identify the monarch. It is possible that the Storm King had taken the treasure, like he had taken so many other valuables, but King Euzegoar still had his crown as he escaped. If the Zughe family had been killed, then it is possible one of the Mazwians had stolen the ring and sold it to someone.\n\nWith a heavy heart, Zonni announced the results of the investigation to his subjects: The Regency would continue indefinitely as none of the members of the Zughe family had been found. Nevertheless, they would not yet abandon hope as no conclusive evidence had proven they were dead either."
zarhay.20.a:0 "One day, the royalty will return..."

zarhay.21.t:0 "The Great Fire"
zarhay.21.d:0 "When Zonni first saw the once great city of Ziani, it was already a mere shadow of its former self. The Storm King had laid waste to the city, burning down many buildings and looting anything of value. Yet in the years since, rebuilding had begun, and already the signs of the previous devastation were few.\n\nMazwians were tenacious like cockroaches.\n\nZonni knew he'd have to do a more thorough job than what the Storm King had done. Only then would the perfidious Mazwians learn their place in the world. His warriors were frustrated by the lack of loot in the city and thus eagerly obeyed his command to set it aflame. Soon enough, ravenous fires spread, and Zonni's soldiers slew anyone who tried to put out the flames. Thousands of zebras fled the city to the countryside, leaving behind the sick and the elderly who were left to perish in the fire. Many others failed to escape in time. The fire spread to the workshops, to the estates of the local aristocracy, to the Imperial Palace. Everything burned with equal intensity. As Zonni gazed upon the flames, he could've sworn he saw Zargitau galloping among them, trampling on burning Mazwians.\n\nIt was a beautiful sight."
zarhay.21.a:0 "Our ancestors smile upon us."

zarhay.22.t:0 "Grave Robbers"
zarhay.22.d:0 "Not long after the destruction of Ziani, Zonni's warriors scoured its surroundings, desperate to find anything of value that the Storm King had missed, eager for something to loot. Soon enough, Zonni was informed that his soldiers were unearthing and defacing the burial mounds of the Mazwian nobility. Among them was the grave of his mother.\n\nZonni immediately travelled to the scene and saw that it was true. The soldiers were busy at work, digging up graves with their shovels and loading up wooden carts full with burial treasures. It was sacrilegious. Not even the Mazwians had dared to disturb the graves of Zar-Hay chieftains. Yet Zonni did not tell them to stop. Instead, he kept walking, trying to find his mother's grave.\n\nIt was not hard to find. Her burial mound was large because she had once been a high-ranking noble. This also meant that it was among the first ones to be looted, and had already been fully emptied of anything precious. Only his mother's naked bones remained. Even the silk clothes that had covered them were now gone.\n\nZonni stood quietly. While he had little fondness for his mother, deep in his heart, he still felt outraged. He wanted to order his warriors to put back every single item they had taken and restore the burial mound. Yet he hesitated. For years he had tried to convince everyone that his Mazwian heritage did not matter. If he now suddenly displayed affection for his mother, then who would believe his words?\n\nThe wind was blowing loudly. He could hardly hear his own thoughts."
zarhay.22.a:0 "Zonni orders the soldiers to stop and put everything back."
zarhay.22.b:0 "Zonni allows the looting to continue."

zarhay.23.t:0 "The Zuwa Of The Great Lakes"
zarhay.23.d:0 "Nobody wanted an eternal regency, not even Zonni. With the failure to find any members of the royal family, and with the subjugation of the entirety of the Great Lakes, the time had come to bring an end to it. Zonni already knew how: He would create a new title, the Imperial title of Zuwa, and crown himself as the supreme ruler of the Great Lakes. This way his lineage and lack of a claim would be irrelevant. The throne of the Kingdom of Zar-Hay would remain vacant, but that did not matter any longer. The age of Imperial Zar-Hay had begun.\n\nThus a lavish ceremony was prepared in Zao, where Zonni would officially be proclaimed as the Zuwa of Zar-Hay, crowned by the Wind-Singers themselves. A grand parade was held, where the soldiers triumphantly marched through the streets, displaying war trophies, loot and enslaved enemies. Every chief and governor in the new Imperial Realm was invited to the grand capital to attend the ceremonies and to swear fealty to their hegemon by kissing his hooves. While some, like Chief Quaggo, were hesitant, all of them eventually did so. In the end, Zonni was enthroned upon a resplendent golden throne made by the finest goldsmiths in Zao, and a crown made out of purple cloth by the most skilled weavers was placed upon his head.\n\nA gentle breeze outside convinced Zonni that his father was proud. He planned to visit his burial mound tomorrow, now a true Zar-Hay who had redeemed his family and restored its honour."

zarhay.24.d:0 "The celebrations after the coronation had lasted long into the night, as Zonni and the aristocracy had feasted on kola nuts and gotten drunk on millet beer and palm wine. When the sun rose, Zonni had trouble waking up, having a terrible headache. His servants told him that an important person was requesting an audience, and he lashed out and told them that the visitor could wait. After several hours, Zonni finally got up to meet with the stranger. When he entered the throne room and saw the zebra, his jaw dropped. He could hardly believe his eyes. His headache worsened and he felt like his skull would rupture.\n\nA zebra adorned in regal clothing stood before him, and on his leg was the Royal Signet Ring. He looked at Zonni with contempt. "It is against courtly conduct to let a visitor wait this long, Zonni Zolon."\nZonni struggled to speak. Eventually, he coughed out some words. "M-my apologies. And who would you be?"\n"I am your King. Azkhai Zughe. And I have come here to reclaim my throne."\nZonni was convinced he was hallucinating now. "...What? But... where on earth did you come from?"\n"I was hiding, away from sight, waiting for the time to return. And the time is now."\n"Waiting? Waiting?!" Zonni's confusion was swiftly overcome by anger. "We've been waiting for our King to return for years now! Where were you all this time?"\n"I was waiting for you. I was going to return much earlier, but I heard the news of your speech, of your ambitions of conquest. Tell me, Zonni Zolon, if I had asked for my throne back then, would you have stepped down and given it to me willingly?"\nThere was deep silence as Zonni couldn't answer.\n"Thought so. But you have had your fun with your wargames and slaughter. Now it is over."\n"Fine!" Zonni barked. "You can be king. But I shall be Zuwa, your overlord!"\nAzkhai's face twisted in disgust. "The King of Zar-Hay kneels to no one. Especially not to a half-Mazwian bloodhound with delusions of grandeur."\nZonni grinded his teeth. The King wanted to take everything away from him! Yet... stepping down felt like the right thing to do. He had fulfilled his duty as regent. But it would return his family back into obscurity. What would the ancestors think of him? Not to mention his father. Would he break the promise he had made to him?"

After several hours, Zonni finally got up to meet with the stranger. When he entered the throne room and saw the zebra, he frowned. It was Ture Sylla, his trusted commander.

The perfect candidate was Zogon, of course, the former master of slaves and current drillmaster in the army. He had considered appointing him to govern other regions before, but that had been foolish. The west was the perfect governorship for him. Zogon would whip the Mazwians into shape, make them extract all the wealth from Buckure's mines and demand taxes that were as high as the ones the Zar-Hay had once paid to their Mazwian masters.\n\nPerhaps now the Mazwians would realize how terrible they and their ancestors had been. Only by tasting their own medicine would they learn that actions have consequences, and that retribution is inevitable."
zarhay.26.d_no_zogon:0 "When it came time to appoint a zebra to govern the western lands, Zonni realized his foolishness. Zogon would have been the perfect candidate, yet had already been appointed to govern another region. By now, Zogon had established himself and was doing a fine job as a governor. Changing his governorship would result in disloyalty and disarray. It was a shame, as Zogon was the only zebra cruel enough to rival the former Mazwian governor of Zar-Hay.\n\nInstead, Zonni turned to his loyal second-in-command and advisor, Chieftess Meynsata. In the many battles of the unification wars she had proven her loyalty and capability, and Zonni was convinced he could entrust her with the task of governing. Unfortunately, Meynsata was honourable and would treat the Mazwian subjects much better than Zogon would have. Yet Zonni still hoped her militaristic rule would keep the Mazwians in line."

zarhay.27.t:0 "Rallying Supporters"
zarhay.27.d:0 "After Zonni had said the faithful words, Azkhai had stormed out of the Palace without saying anything in response. Zonni was tempted to tell the guards to arrest him, but knew that would risk a mutiny.\n\nA mutiny soon happened regardless.\n\nThousands of Zonni's soldiers defected to join the King. Even some of the most loyal warriors and officers betrayed him. The Zuwa was shocked, as he had fought alongside them for years, yet now they all flocked to the King whose return they had waited for so long. After the initial shock subsided, Zonni was enraged, yet determined. He would have to teach all these traitors a lesson. Those who remained loyal were his most trusted warriors, and he knew they'd follow him to the gates of Tartarus if need be. All he had to do was rally them to him and encourage them to fight against their former comrades.\n\nZonni gathered his loyal troops at [Root.Capital.GetName], where he would hold a speech for them. Afterwards, they would head straight back to the newly formed frontlines. He climbed atop a pedestal and addressed his soldiers, who were standing in formation in the central market square. For the first time, a microphone and a loudspeaker imported from abroad had been put in place so every zebra could hear his voice.\n"My most trustworthy warriors! All of us hoped for peace, longing to return to our homes and families, but alas that was not to be. Our brothers and sisters have betrayed us, and the absent King proved to be a treacherous snake. Now the Empire we forged together has been sundered!\nBut what was broken can be remade. Hope is not yet lost. All that we must do is put down this rebellion and restore order. Then, we can finally have everlasting peace in the Great Lakes. So I ask you, my warriors, join me one last time to fight the final fateful battle! We will bring justice to the traitors or die trying. With your courage and experience, victory is assured. Zargitau is with us! Let us go forth and gain glorious victory!"\n\nThe cacophonous cheers of the soldiers echoed louder than any sound a loudspeaker could produce. Zonni smiled proudly."

zarhay.28.d:0 "After the final capitulations of the False King's loyalists, Zonni was quick to deliver justice upon them. Many lower ranking officers and commoners were simply ordered to be executed, while more high-ranking zebras received individual judgement from Zuwa Zonni himself. Each of them would be ordered to kneel before him and acknowledge him as their rightful sovereign. Refusal would result in a mercifully swift death.\n\nChief Quaggo was among the last ones brought before him. He was quick to defect to the False King's side when he had appeared, and had never been particularly fond of Zonni. The Zuwa felt regret for ever trusting him with anything. As the Chief was thrown down onto the floor in chains, Zonni sneered at him.\n"Your betrayal has finally brought me here, so you can face justice for your actions. Yet I have learned the value of mercy; bend the knee and I shall spare you. But do not expect me to grant you any position of authority in my Imperial Realm."\nQuaggo spat at his hooves. "I would rather die than live under your reign, arch-traitor and tyrant! Since I first saw your half-blooded face, I knew you couldn't be trusted with the position of Regent. Oppression and brutality is part of Mazwian heritage, that much is obvious. You have proven it to be true more than anyone else. Now be quick and end me, so I do not have to suffer from your presence."\nFor a while, Zonni said nothing. Quaggo was defiant until the end, and insulted him in the worst ways possible. The Zuwa was tempted to simply trample him to death with his own hooves. Yet he wondered. How many other prejudiced zebras shared Quaggo's thoughts? He had seen how deeply ingrained tribal divisions were in the Great Lakes. Despite his best attempts to appease his subjects, they would possibly never forget about his heritage. Comprehensive changes were needed to truly unify the many tribes of the region.\nZonni smiled thankfully to Quaggo. "Your words have given me food for thought. I am grateful. So grateful, in fact, that I shall spare you from sharing the grisly fate of your False King. Go, and be free."\nQuaggo stared at him in shock as the guards unshackled him. "No!" he shouted. "I will not live as a subject of a Mazwian ever again!" He galloped to the nearest window and jumped out, leaping to his doom.\nZonni lifted an eyebrow, then shrugged. "Bring the next prisoner.""

But times were changing, and Zonni's enemy, King Azkhai, took advantage of this. He spread emancipatory rhetoric, promising to end slavery in the Great Lakes. He made sure the word spread into lands under Zonni's control, too.\n\nSoon enough, the Zuwa received reports of large-scale slave uprisings in several areas. Somehow, the slaves had gotten weapons and had formed fighting units. Yet for Zonni it was hardly a mystery. Azkhai was endangering the societal order by arming the slaves and inciting them to revolt. He was playing a dangerous game. Did he not realize that if he won the civil war, the slaves would simply turn against him?\n\nZonni was certain the slaves could be crushed easily. But Azkhai had possibly sowed the seeds of rebellion into the hearts of slaves. Seeds that might one day grow into something terrible."

Yet knowledge of these acts of terror was mostly spread in rumours, which were embellished and twisted into fantastical stories about Zonni being the Scourge of God. Yet not all acts were equally notable and some rumours were entirely fabricated, so it was difficult to tell what Zonni had actually done to his enemies.\n\nThings changed with King Azkhai. Through cooperation with the victims and survivors, he learned the full truth of what Zonni had done, and began spreading the information with the help of griots, who travelled from village to village and recited everything that was known about Zonni's actions. He was exposed as a mass murderer, Kingslayer, tyrant. Evidence was made clear for all to see, leaving no doubt of the truth. Yet at the end of these speeches was a hopeful message that Zonni would face justice for his actions, if not from Azkhai, then from God.\n\nZonni was furious when he heard of this. Once again, truth was used as a weapon against him. Azkhai would pay for this, but in a way, he was thankful. Perhaps Azkhai's supporters would grow fearful of Zonni and surrender, rather than resist and face his wrath. He hoped that would be the case."

He presented the loot to his father and sat down on the ground, smiling.\n"As I promised, I have returned at long last. Not as a mere warrior-noble or Regent, but as Zuwa, Emperor of the Great Lakes!" he proclaimed.\n\nThe wind was silent.\n\nZonni's grin faltered. "No one dares to mock our family anymore, father. Our enemies faced swift justice. The honour that was lost is now fully restored!"\n\nThe wind was silent.\n\nZonni grew increasingly frustrated. "Why do you say nothing? I have done what few could ever even hope to accomplish! Chronicles now bear the name of our family which was once fading into irrelevance! What more could I possibly do?"\n\nThe wind was silent.\n\nZonni let out a deep sigh. "I understand. Conquering is easy. Ruling is not. I have to avoid sharing the fate of the Storm King. I have to create a lasting legacy for our family. And... I must unite the tribes. Now I realize, father, why you married a Mazwian mare. You did not care for petty tribal divisions. You wished for peace between the tribes, not bloodshed... I have punished the Mazwians for what they did to us, and the debt is repaid. There should no longer be a feud between us. I will make sure of it."\nThe grass around him rustled from a gentle breeze. The mighty Zuwa humbly prostrated himself before the grave."

zarhay.32.d:0 "While Zuwa Zonni had proclaimed himself to be the protector of Re'emites years ago, he had never visited Re'em itself. Until now. A grand procession departed Zao, travelling westwards, and crossed the border into Re'em. The Zuwa was escorted by hundreds of guards and courtiers, as well as many slaves who were carrying valuable gifts for the Re'emites.\n\nWhen the local horses saw this grand caravan, they appeared unenthusiastic. They seemed to be especially bothered by the zebra slaves, who were forced to carry heavy loads on their backs. Zonni saw this, and hoped to appeal to them by freely distributing nuggets of gold from the Buckure mines. When this appeared to have little effect, Zonni muttered a curse and ordered the caravan to continue on its way.\n\n[REE.GetLeader] and his entourage welcomed Zonni to the capital of Re'em. A ceremony was held and the two national leaders exchanged generous gifts with one another. Hospitality was important to Re'emites, so [REE.GetLeader] was more friendly to the visitors than the commoners had been. After a meal with traditional Re'emite cuisine such as wheat bread, figs, pomegranates and plentiful wine, Zonni initiated negotations with the Re'emite leader.\n\nThe Zuwa told him of the devastation caused by the recent wars and the economic underdevelopment of his nation. He was deeply grateful for previous Re'emite aid, but wanted the cooperation to not only continue, but expand. His new Imperial Realm had plenty of wealth to share with foreign friends. [REE.GetLeader] was hesistant however, and asked if Zar-Hay would continue to protect the Re'emites. Zonni assured him that was the case. Then [REE.GetLeader] asked about Zonni's questionable actions, and the continued practice of slavery, and said he wasn't sure if he wanted to help such a ruler. Zonni felt insulted, yet remained calm. He appealed to his emotions, saying how every passing minute a zebra foal died of hunger. [REE.GetLeader] said nothing. Then Zonni became frustrated, and said "Fine! We shall abolish slavery eventually. But only if you promise to aid us!"\n\nThus a deal was signed and the two leaders shook hooves. However, the tensions between the two were clear for all to see."

There was even some guilt about helping Zar-Hay in the first place, as it had committed many atrocities and was now dominating the region. Re'em needed protection from Zar-Hay more than anything. If they refused to aid the tyrannical Empire, then they would be swiftly crushed by a furious Zuwa and his mighty army.\n\n[REE.GetLeader] still wanted to help the common populace of Zar-Hay, as they should not suffer for the actions of their monarch. But something had to be done to topple the despotic regime, before Re'em would outlive its usefulness to it.\n\n[REE.GetLeader] ordered his most trusted agents to find some kind of resistance figure who could oppose Zonni's government. Soon enough, they found a Zar-Hay mare called Nyaberi Zargey who was amassing a small but dedicated following. She was a radical and dangerous ideologue, and thus the perfect weapon to use against Zonni Zolon. After she was secretly contacted, she quickly agreed to work together with Re'em to ensure the downfall of the regime. With the newfound support, she would establish a proper political party in her homeland which would strive for the liberation of the populace from tyranny."

Multiple interrogations revealed the name of "Nyaberi Zargey", yet little else was known about the zebra. A country-wide search for this individual was then initiated. The Zuwa was concerned that if the head of the red snake wasn't cut quickly, it would bite and inject the nation with cursed poison."

Zargitau would be proud of him."\n"I will have him promoted at once. Such courageous and loyal zebras deserve to be rewarded."\nMeynsata nodded, satisfied with Zonni's decision. "Thank you. While he has not asked for promotions, I am sure he will rejoice. I shall tell the news to him at once."\n"Wait, Meynsata, before you go," Zonni said just as she was about to leave. "I wished to inquire about something."\n"What is it, my Zuwa?" she asked.\n"When the claimant King revealed himself... did you consider betraying me? I know you do not agree with my harsh actions against my enemies. Maybe you thought he would've been a better ruler than me."\nMeynsata was taken aback, and for a while didn't know what to say. "My Zuwa, I..."\n"You can be honest with me, Meynsata," Zonni said with a rare smile.\n"Well then. Briefly, I did. I remembered your justification, that harsh responses to anything you interpret as a personal attack are a way to guarantee you are not attacked again. The intent is to make yourself feared. But... I think you only make others hate you more."\nNow it was Zonni who was silent for a while. "Then... why did you remain loyal?"\n"Because I know that inside you, there is a stallion devoted to honour and justice.

zarhay.36.t:0 "Increased Internal Migration"
zarhay.36.d:0 "Through various reforms and improved internal security, the Zuwa encouraged migration between different parts of the Empire. Economic disparity motivated many zebras to move from poorer rural areas to richer urban ones, especially as the country continued to slowly modernize. Freedom of movement and safe travel routes further facilitated migration. Migrants from distant provinces were even welcomed in Zao, as hostility towards fellow subjects of the Zuwa had been forbidden by law.\n\nWhile initially, there were tensions between migrants and locals in many areas, many families successfully settled down in unfamiliar societies. Unfortunately, many of these migrant groups formed their own communities and clung to their tribal identities even after migrating. One district in Zao occupied by Mazwian migrants even became known as "Mazwitown". Such ethnic enclaves clash against Zonni's plans of integration, so more work has to be done if the tribes are to be united."
zarhay.36.a:0 "Progress is made, at least."

zarhay.37.t:0 "Increased Tribal Intermarriage"
zarhay.37.d:0 "Ancient taboos on marrying "foreigners" from other tribes were abolished, and thus Wind-Singers and other religious authorities across the nation were allowed to bless marriages between any citizen of Zar-Hay. This quickly lead to a sharp increase in the number of marriages between zebras from different tribes, creating many multi-ethnic mixed families. This was especially common between migrants and locals. The foals of these new couples would be the ones most easy to integrate, so within one generation the nation would already be much more united.\n\nHowever, majority of marriages remained contained within individual ethnic groups, and there was little Zonni could do as he could not force his subjects to marry. While he had the legal power to do almost anything, he knew the folly of forced marriages. Integration had to be voluntary for it to be truly effective. Therefore, further measures to encourage integration needed to be taken."
zarhay.37.a:0 "Not to mention some of the marriages produce no offspring..."

zarhay.38.t:0 "Engineering National Identity"
zarhay.38.d:0 "With increasing state power, came increasing ability of social engineering. For that, however, Zonni had to reluctantly ally with intellectuals from Timbucktu who had pan-Great Lakes ideas of their own. They would be tasked with creating various national symbols for Zar-Hay that would represent the various cultures of the Great Lakes. The purpose was to create a sense of shared identity among the subjects of the Zuwa. These symbols could be anything: Flags, songs, animals, traditions, holidays and so on. As long as they could be used for the purpose of nation-building, it was good enough for Zonni.\n\nSoon enough, the intellectuals had created various proposals. Several flag designs had been made, a traditional song had been adapted into an anthem, a dress used in some isolated rural area was chosen as the national dress, and so on. Zonni picked the ones he thought were suitable and officialized them as national symbols. Finally, these symbols would become known to the population through schools and national festivals. With these shared symbols, a shared identity would be fostered over time. Slowly but surely, the tribes of the Great Lakes were putting their differences aside."
zarhay.38.a:0 "One flag, one nation, one tribe!"

zarhay.39.t:0 "Amalgamation Of A Culture"
zarhay.39.d:0 "While the Zuwa encouraged cultural exchange in general, he decided to make a focused effort to assimilate a single notable culture into the Zar-Hay. There were countless tribes in the Great Lakes, some small and others large, each with their own special traits that had developed over centuries. Zuwa Zonni considered this list to be too vast, and thus narrowed it down to three interesting cultures which could in some way empower the Zar-Hay and the Great Lakes as a whole.\n\nThe first of these was the culture of the savage tribes who lived in the arid fringes of the region. Their population was small, but they were known for their ferocity. They were adopted to the heat of the desert and guarding of the trans-Zebharan trade routes had given them plentiful military experience. Some tribes had already sworn fealty to Zonni, and he respected their abilities greatly. Zar-Hay warriors could learn much from these zebras.\n\nThe second culture of interest was that of Hayzebland. The zebras of Hayzeb had many prospering cities and a vast population. Despite their historical lack of political unity, they were fairly culturally homogenous. Above all, they were industrious and mercantile folk. They were certainly an inspirational model for the Zar-Hay.\n\nThe last culture belonged to the former rivals of Zar-Hay, the Mazwians. Zonni knew it was a controversial option, but he also felt obliged to mend the rift between the tribes of his parents. Perhaps by mixing the two with one another would encourage peace and reconciliation? Nevertheless, Mazwians were capable miners and administrators, being one of the most civilized tribes in the region.\n\nEventually, Zonni finally decided on what culture would form a vital part of the reforged identity of the Zar-Hay."
zarhay.39.a:0 "Our thundering hooves will bring about a sandstorm!"
zarhay.39.b:0 "Zar-Hay should embrace their mercantile heritage."
zarhay.39.c:0 "Two former enemies, united as one!"

zarhay.40.t:0 "Abolitionist Pressure"
zarhay.40.d:0 "For millenia, no zebra had questioned the practice of slavery in the Great Lakes. It was seen as normal and justified for the indebted, the criminals and the prisoners of war to be servile property of their rightful masters. Slaves were the lowest caste, below freezebras and even merchants. Those who were enslaved would doom their offspring to perpetual slavery as well, thus ensuring the caste remained in existence. Slaves usually worked as servants or manual labourers and were owned by either wealthy landowners or the Kingdom. The rest of the Great Lakes had diverse societies, some of which had abolished slavery while others had a system that was almost identical to the one in Zar-Hay. With the unification of the region, the Zar-Hay societal structure was imposed upon the entire region, and thousands of prisoners of war from conquered states were enslaved.\n\nBut there was ever growing pressure to outlaw the practice of slavery, to ban the treatment of individuals as property. The strongest arguments weren't ethical, but economical: As free subjects, former slaves could contribute more to the economy. They could do any jobs they wished, attain education and move to cities. Slaves were dead weight, it was argued. Most importantly though, Zonni had made a promise to Re'emites. In exchance for their aid, he had sworn to eventually abolish slavery. Zonni might've been cruel, but so far he had been a zebra who held true to his word.\n\nThe pressure was becoming overwhelming. Zonni had to decide what to do about slavery. He was the only zebra in the Great Lakes with the power to dismantle it once and for all, if he wanted to."
zarhay.40.a:0 "Slavery is our ancient tradition!"
zarhay.40.b:0 "Slavery will be gradually abolished."
zarhay.40.c:0 "Slavery shall be banned at once!"

zarhay.41.t:0 "Gradual Emancipation"
zarhay.41.d:0 "In fear of angering the slaveowners of his Imperial Realm, Zonni had decided to take a more careful approach to abolishing slavery. First he had instated freedom of the womb, meaning any offspring of slaves would become free zebras at birth. Next he had forbidden the act of enslavement from anyone except state officials, who he never ordered to do so anyways. Then he had emancipated different kinds of slaves one by one, starting with the indebted and ending with the prisoners of war. Finally, before some had even realized, the institution of slavery had been torn down.\n\nHowever, not all former slaves became free. Prisoners of war continued to be subjected to forced labour. Slaves who had been servants continued to serve, earning a meagre wage that was barely enough for sustenance. And lastly, outlawing slavery did not simply erase it, as some continued to keep slaves in secret. State officials often turned a blind eye when they discovered such cases.\n\nZonni had cared little for these issues. What mattered to him was that the abolitionists and the Re'emites had finally gone quiet and left him alone."
zarhay.41.a:0 "Freedom is a rare privilege."

zarhay.42.t:0 "Reunion"
zarhay.42.d:0 "Zonni walked in the windy plains outside of Zao yet again, carrying a bag on his back. But this time he did not come alone. A hundred labourers followed him, bringing shovels and various other tools.\n\nHe stopped at his father's tomb. "Father, I have returned," he said to it. "I have done as I promised. The rifts between the Zar-Hay and the Mazwians are slowly but surely being healed. The two tribes shall be united, like you and mother were." Near him, the workers began their work and dug into the father's mound with their shovels. Zonni grabbed the bag from his back. "And now, you two shall be united once more." He opened the bag, and revealed that it was full of bleached bones. "You should've always been buried together. This shall be an everlasting symbol of the union of the tribes."\n\nAfter several hours, the work was complete. The mound had been re-opened, the bones of Zonni's mother had been placed next to the bones of his father, and the mound was closed again. As the workers began to depart, headed back to their homes, Zonni looked at the mound wistfully and sighed. He could feel the wind blowing on his cheeks, as if it was kissing him gratefully."
zarhay.42.a:0 "Rest in peace now."

zarhay.43.t:0 "Zar-Hay's Ultimatum"
zarhay.43.d:0 "An emissary sent by the Zuwa of Zar-Hay, Zonni Zolon, arrived in [Root.Capital.GetName], accompanied by hardened zebra warriors. She requested an audience with [Root.GetLeader] to discuss an important and urgent matter. Her wish was granted, and soon the two met in private.\n\nThe emissary relayed the message of her master, which was revealed to be an ultimatum. Zuwa Zonni was demanding that [Root.GetName] recognize his supreme authority and submit themselves under his personal protection. He would entrust them with the duty of guarding his Imperial Realm's eastern border from outside threats. If this ultimatum was not accepted, then the dervishes could not be trusted and would have to be... "subjugated by force".\n\nThe ultimatum received a cold reception. They weren't being given much choice: Submit or die. Yet the dervishes did not fear death, and possibly valued their hard-earned freedom even more. [Root.GetLeader] had to quickly decide how to respond to the threat. Would they accept a life of servitude, or die as free hyenas?"
zarhay.43.a:0 "We kneel to no one!"
zarhay.43.b:0 "This is the only way to ensure survival."

zarhay.44.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] Refuses Ultimatum"
zarhay.44.d:0 "The emissary Zonni sent to [From.Capital.GetName] returned to Zao and relayed the reply of [From.GetLeader], the leader of the hyenas. Unfortunately, they did not realize how merciful and generous his offer had been. Their refusal to recognize Zonni's authority made them an enemy of the Imperial Realm, and he would not tolerate an enemy on his border. Already, the Imperial Army has been mobilized and ordered to crush the arrogant dervishes of the east."
zarhay.44.a:0 "They will not last long."

zarhay.45.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] Accepts Ultimatum"
zarhay.45.d:0 "The emissary Zonni sent to [From.Capital.GetName] returned to Zao and relayed the reply of [From.GetLeader], the leader of the hyenas. Fortunately, they realized how merciful and generous his offer had been. Their acceptance of Zonni's authority makes them a subject of the Imperial Realm. In return for guarding the eastern border of the realm, they will fully maintain their internal autonomy. Zonni was pleased with this news, as he had fully expected the dervishes to refuse. The Imperial Army was thus demobilized and ordered to stand down -- for now, at least."
zarhay.45.a:0 "They shall serve him faithfully."

zarhay.46.t:0 "Zwahile-Farma"
zarhay.46.d:0 "The newly integrated southern region of Zwahile is distant from the capital, and covers a large geographical area. Therefore a new governorate needs to be established to administer local affairs. [Root.GetLeader] does not have many options, as most of the good governor candidates have already been assigned other regions to govern. The nature of the south as a more of a frontier region however did present the possibility of assigning a zebra with a military background. For this purpose, [Root.GetLeader] considered appointing Fari Ndebi, a faithful officer who had served the Kingdom for many years. He, if anyone, would be able to ensure that the locals remain loyal to Zar-Hay and that defences will be ready against any threats from the west or east. However, as he is so militarily minded he is not perhaps the best possible option for the position of governor, as he would likely neglect civilian matters."
zarhay.46.a:0 "Ndebi will secure the south."

She requested an audience with [Root.GetLeader] to discuss an important and urgent matter. Her wish was granted, and soon the two met in private.\n\nThe emissary relayed the message of her master, which was revealed to be an ultimatum. Zuwa Zonni was demanding that [Root.GetName] would cede Ovingoland to Zar-Hay, so he can personally guarantee the security of its zebra inhabitants, many of whom are refugees from the Great Lakes. If this ultimatum was not accepted, then he would seek "alternate methods" of taking control of the region.\n\nThe ultimatum received a cold reception. They weren't given much choice: Give Ovingoland or we will take it by force. [Root.GetLeader] had to consider carefully if the region was worth fighting over, or if it should simply be given away."
zarhay.47.a:0 "Ovingoland is and always will be [Root.GetAdjective]!"

zarhay.58.d:0 "There were hundreds of burial mounds in the grassy fields near Zao, belonging to myriad families of noble descent. Out of all of them, the one belonging to Zonni's father was likely the smallest. It had always been humiliating for Zonni, and something other aristocrats had mocket him for, but that would now change. Soon, he'd be the one having the last laugh.\n\nThousands of workers arrived in the fields, carrying with them tools and construction materials. They would begin work on creating the grandest burial mound Zar-Hay had ever seen. Stone foundations were set for numerous large rooms which would be filled to the brim with burial goods, most of which was loot from Zonni's conquests: Mazwian gold, Aorandan grain, bronze jewelry from Hayzebland and intricate pottery from Timbucktu. In the passages that connected them, artificial rivers of liquid mercury would flow, representing Zonni's love for rivers. In the entrance, a grand army of clay zebras would guard the mound from grave robbers. Countless workers perished during the construction in accidents, especially during the final phase when the tomb complex was buried with earth. Some of the workers had also tried stealing burial goods, so Zonni ordered them to be buried alive.\n\nWhen construction was finally completed and the bones of his family moved inside the new underground mausoleum, Zonni inspected the finished work and was pleased. Never again would anyone mock him or his family - not that they dared to do so anyways, knowing retribution would be swift."

It does not matter if the ultimatum is accepted or refused, the end result is likely the same. But refusal would at least be an act of defiance, and a slim opportunity to retain freedom by fighting back against tyranny.\n\nHow shall we respond?"

In fact, with this act they have proven themselves to be enemies. Zuwa Zonni has officially stated that the Re'emite citizens are eager to join Zar-Hay, yet their treacherous leaders planned to stab their zebra allies in the back.

zarhay.62.t:0 "A Remnant Of The Past"
zarhay.62.d:0 "With mass education, economic development and meritocracy in the army, more and more subjects of the Zuwa began to question the necessity of having a caste system. In multiple governorates, and even in Zar-Hay proper, zebras were protesting for the abolishment on restrictions of marriage between castes, and for repealing any laws which limited social mobility. In practice, the caste system had already ceased to exist in the largest cities, where market forces pulled individuals from one occupation to another. Before, the son of a potter was destined to be a potter, but in many places, that was no longer the case.\n\nZonni himself had disdained the existence of a martial warrior caste, even though he had been a member of it. He was an ardent advocate of meritocracy, promoting officers based on skill and not heritage. In the Imperial Army, soldiers came from all kinds of castes. Yet such meritocracy had not extended beyond the military. His advisors reasoned that taking action to repeal the caste system would strengthen the economy as zebras could seek any occupation they wanted. Some, however, warned that forcefully doing such a fundamental societal transformation would be difficult, requiring considerable effort. Especially the upper castes, the aristocrats, would do anything they could to oppose any change to the societal hierarchy.\n\nZonni had the final word, as always. All he had to do was to decide if change was necessary, or if things were fine as they were."

zarhay.63.t:0 "Secrets Of Life And Death"
zarhay.63.d:0 "Zuwa Zonni arrived in Zarabara with his escort of servants and guards, and saw that the town had changed much over time. The Chief's hut had been replaced with a large modern laboratory, where hundreds of underpaid workers laboured day and night to mass produce magical potions. They were for the most part sold to the Imperial Army, and profits from the sales made the town thrive. It had wide paved streets, tall houses and even a sewage system.\n\nZonni entered the laboratory, having already informed the Chief of his arrival beforehoof. Yet he did not come to meet him, and his servant simply requested him to come to the meeting room. While Zonni was insulted by this, he knew it was unwise to anger the sorcerer. He left his escort behind and entered the room where Chief Faran was waiting. Zonni sat down opposite him and accepted an offer of kola nuts as a gift. "You must know why I have come here, so let us get straight to the point," Zonni said.\n"I know. But I cannot give you what you want."\nZonni frowned. "Excuse me? Surely, the greatest potion brewer in the Great Lakes knows the recipe of a potion that can prolong one's life?"\n"It would be useless. You are not far from death."\nZonni's frown deepened, twisted by anger. "What? Are you threatening me?"\nFaran shook his head and pointed at a small lump in Zonni's neck. "You have a tumour right here. If it's malignant, you won't last much longer."\nZonni blinked in shock and touched the round outgrowth. He hadn't paid much attention to it, but he felt like it had gotten larger over time. "W-what? Is there no cure for this?"\n"For cancer? No, and I doubt there ever will be. Maybe in a century or so."\nShock was swiftly replaced by anger. "Surely you can some up with some way to keep me alive! Or are you a mere fraud, instead of a true sorcerer?"\n"The only creatures immune to cancer are alicorns and dragons. You appear to be neither, so you are doomed."\nZonni clenched his teeth. "Is there anything I can do, then?"\nFaran nodded slowly. "Write a testament. Inform the heir. Make sure the Great Lakes does not fall into anarchy again when you die."\n"But I have no heirs! No close relatives, nothing!"\n"Then appoint one. You have absolute power, do you not?"\nZonni let out a deep sigh, deeper than the abyss of Tartarus."
zarhay.63.a:0 "Who will inherit his legacy?"

zarhay.64.t:0 "Appointing An Heir"
zarhay.64.d:0 "Zonni Zolon was still relatively young, and few cared that he had no official heir yet, except for some of his advisors. But if the sorcerer was right, he had to appoint one as soon as possible, to avoid a disastrous succession crisis from tearing his Imperial Realm apart. He would not allow his family's legacy to be erased by selfish fools. Yet no one was informed that he would die soon. No one except for one zebra, the only one Zonni trusted.\n\nChieftess Meynsata was requested to meet with the Zuwa, and she arrived as quickly as she could. She was never late for anything. When she entered Zonni's throne room, he barked at his servants to leave them alone. Once the room emptied, he sighed deeply. "Meynsata, there is something I must tell you."\n"What is it, my Zuwa?"\n"I am a doomed stallion. Chief Faran said I have cancer, and I have no reason to doubt his words."\nMeynsata's eyes widened in shock. "W-why are you telling me this? Shouldn't you tell everyzebra?"\n"No! They will become like vultures, circling around my dying body. No, it must remain secret. I told you because I want you to inherit the Realm."\nSomehow, Meynsata's eyes widened even more. "Me? Do you really trust me that much?"\n"Yes. Meynsata, I... if things had gone differently, I would've liked for you to be my spouse. You are a mare of valour and honour. I was never... brave enough to tell you that. But it doesn't matter now. I am certain you will do a fine job as the ruler. You will be far more just than I ever was."\nMeynsata kneeled before him, tears forming in her eyes. "I understand, Zonni. I also wish things could've gone differently. But life is rarely predictable. I swear, I will not disappoint you."\nA bittersweet smile formed on Zonni's lips. "I know. You never have.""

He was bedridden, and it became clear to every zebra in his court that his death was near. Like he had predicted, the vultures began to circle around him, only to be disappointed to learn that he had appointed Meynsata as his heir.\n\nIn his final moments of clarity and consciousness, he told he wished to be buried next to his parents and said he wanted a grand stone epitaph to be erected in the center of Zao. It would read:\n\nYou wail about the loss of life, yet you will live your lives in peace due to my labours.\nYou speak of tyranny, yet you are spared the lash of hunger, the dagger of disease, the sword of fire, thanks to my stability.\nYou claim to live in fear, yet can you not wander the streets and the roads, safe from brigands and bandits thanks to my armies?\nYou bleat about lack of trust, yet I have forged unity and made a thousand bickering tribes into one people.\nYou whine about what was taken from you, yet you are wealthier than you or your ancestors ever were!\nYou cry and moan, saying I'm a monster, yet that very same monster guards your doors from all that which would hurt you!\nYou rave about what was lost, when I gave you everything!\n\nHe fell into a coma on the following day and despite the best efforts of the doctors, passed away within a week.

Zonni's body was not yet buried and was kept in the palace, and his servants acted like he was still alive. In the meantime Meynsata ensured the Imperial Army was ready for any potential internal unrest. Finally, one week after his death, the truth was revealed to the public.\n\nThe news spread like wildfire across the Imperial Realm. In Zar-Hay, zebras were overtaken by shock and grief, and countless thousands flocked to attend his grand funeral where he was entombed within the burial mound he had constructed. Elsewhere in the Imperial Realm, the mood was more mixed. While many zebras had grown to respect Zonni and accept his rule, they did not necessarily want to remain as subjects of the Imperial Realm. Loyalty was shaky especially among the local sycophantic aristocrats which Zonni had never deposed or weakened. Yet despite these tensions, nothing happened and the country remained calm.\n\nThen a spark lit a bushfire in Macigena.\n\nBaga-Tarkhan of Macigena, Monzon, showed his gratitude to Zonni by launching a well-organized uprising soon after he heard the news of his death. It quickly became clear he had been preparing for it, and a scandal erupted among the Eyes of the Zuwa for failing to prevent the rebellion. He had raised a small army seemingly out of nowhere and expelled any administrators and soldiers loyal to the Imperial Realm of Zar-Hay. His goal was apparently to restore Macigena's independence.\n\nUltimately, his action seemed suicidal. Even with his small personal rebel host, he stood no chance against the might of the Imperial Army, despite his skills in guerilla warfare. Clearly, his only hope was to inspire other uprisings elsewhere. The fate of the Imperial Realm hung in the balance."

Then, he proclaimed that he, as the King of Alwani, was no longer a servant of Zar-Hay. Soon thousands of zebras joined his revolt. Timbucktu, which had previously defied him, now accepted him as their rightful ruler and pledged allegiance to him.\n\nWhen Meynsata heard of this, she remembered how Zonni had spared Euzegoar's life in exchange for his loyalty. Now that he was dead, there was no reason for Euzegoar to continue to serve Zar-Hay. She realized that if Zonni had been true to his nature, instead of being honourable like her, this could've been avoided.\n\nPerhaps Zonni had been right. Being just and merciful wasn't always the right thing to do. Meynsata would remember this when she'd next time meet with Euzegoar, the traitor king."

zarhay.68.t:0 "Uprising In Ugabi!"
zarhay.68.d:0 "There had always been uneasiness between the Lake-Farma, Amanyi, and the central government. He did not always fully comply with orders and insisted on being able to garrison his own governorate with his own troops. Some concessions were made, but generally Zonni had kept him in a tight leash, threatening to punish him for disobedience.\n\nWhen Zonni died, it was therefore not surprising that Amanyi was much more actively working against Zar-Hay. The Eyes of the Zuwa reported of weapons being smuggled and former UCTA soldiers defecting from the Imperial Army. An arrest warrant was finally issued on Amanyi, but it was too late. With his military force, Amanyi seized personal control of his governorship and declared independence from the Imperial Realm. He urged locals to join his rebellion against a "tyrannical monarchy". With the great prosperity and size of his new breakaway realm, he was able to muster a strong army to secure its independence.\n\nMeynsata couldn't help but feel sorry for Amanyi. Zonni had coerced him to become a governor against his will. A revolt was therefore only a matter of time. It was unfortunate she was the one who was now burdened with the responsibility of dealing with it."
zarhay.68.a:0 "He will be dealt with eventually."

zarhay.69.t:0 "Uprising In Mazwi!"
zarhay.69.d:0 "Under Zogon's governorship, Mazwi had suffered terribly. Harsh taxes were imposed on the local populace, crimes were punished most severely and thousands were arrested, suspected of treason. Despite being half-Mazwian, Zonni had done little to improve the situation. So when he died, it was unsurprising that they would depose Zogon.\n\nThe zebras rallied behind a figure who called himself Manza Maghad, the rightful successor of the late Manza Mahud. He waged a campaign of insurgency, driving out the Zar-Hay garrison with terrible efficiency. Soon, he had gathered a proper army under his banner of liberation. However, he also made promises to restore the Imperial reign of Mazwi over the Great Lakes.\n\nMeynsata found irony in the situation. Maghad reminded her of Zonni back in the day, when he had led a rebellion against Mazwian oppression. Now the tables had turned and it was the Mazwians' turn to do the same. Yet it did not amuse her in the slightest. This appeared like an unending cycle of violence. She would have to stop it, permanently."

zarhay.70.t:0 "The Imperial Army Swears Loyalty"
zarhay.70.d:0 "After the initial shock of the uprising in Macigena and its ripple effects elsewhere in the Imperial Realm, the commanding officers of the Imperial Army reassured their loyalty to the new Zuwa. The soldiers of the army had fought alongside Meynsata for many years and thus knew she would be a capable ruler of Zar-Hay. They went to action to suppress unrest, especially in areas of direct military control such as protectorates. Afterwards the Imperial Army prepared to crush the rebels who had broken free of Zar-Hay dominion.\n\nMeynsata's determination grew, though she still felt like she could never surpass Zonni's prowess as a military leader. But surely she was more than capable enough of dealing with an army of traitors?"
zarhay.70.a:0 "March to victory!"

zarhay.71.t:0 "The [GetMonth] Revolution"
zarhay.71.d:0 "There comes a point where popular unrest reaches a critical threshold. Once it is reached, the only way to restore order is through violence.\n\nAs the central government of Zar-Hay was unable to calm the rebellious commoners and soldiers who sympathised with them, the situation quickly went out of hoof. Soon, armed militants were roaming the streets of major cities and government buildings were seized one by one. The situation had deteriorated so completely that there was no choice but to mobilize the army. A civil war was inevitable.\n\nMeanwhile, Nyaberi Zargey lit a cigar from Puerto Caballo as she waited for the news. So far, everything had gone according to plan, but plans had an unfortunate tendency to backfire. She lifted her gaze as a zebra entered her makeshift office. "So, how did it go, General Zaberi?" she asked from him.\nThe zebra saluted her. "We have successfully secured control of the capital. However, we were unable to capture the leader."\nNyaberi let out an exasperated sigh. "Of course. Oh well, could've gone worse. I guess we've still got work to do then, eh?"\n"Yes, comrade."\n"What are you waiting for, then? There's reactionaries to shoot. Go!"\nThe general nodded and left. Nyaberi relaxed on her uncomfortable seat. Soon enough, she'd be sitting in a proper modern office with a leather chair."
zarhay.71.a:0 "Death to the old order!"
zarhay.71.b:0 "Death to the rebel scum!"

zarhay.72.t:0 "The New Oaths"
zarhay.72.d:0 "The original oaths had been dictated by Zonni himself. As he had been illiterate, a scribe had accurately written down his words. Yet Zonni was a warrior who demanded military discipline from all of his subjects. While Meynsata was a warrior as well, she knew that she could not treat soldiers and commoners alike. Therefore she entrusted a court official to rewrite the oaths to be less strict. The revised four oaths were:\n\nWith God as my witness, I solemnly swear to dedicate a part of my life to diligent, productive labour to further the prosperity of my household. I shall obediently give a small portion of my wealth to the Zuwa, so she may use it wisely for the common good of the nation.\n\nWith God as my witness, I solemnly swear to dedicate a part of my life to community service. I shall not conspire against the rightful government, for the sake of peace and order in the realm. I shall obey the commands of my superiors and only question them if they are unreasonable.\n\nWith God as my witness, I solemnly swear to dedicate a part of my life to public security. I shall not aid any potential spies or criminals, instead reporting them to my superiors so they may be dealt with.\n\nWith God as my witness, I solemnly swear to dedicate a part of my life to defending the nation against any foreign incursions. I shall answer the call when I am needed on the front. In battle, I shall only retreat or surrender when the sole other alternative is death."

zarhay.73.t:0 "On The Matter Of Trade"
zarhay.73.d:0 "Meynsata was not particularly fond of policymaking, but it was a necessary evil for a ruler like her. She had inherited this burden from a stallion whom she had respected, perhaps even admired. She wanted to make Zonni's spirit proud while it still roamed the land. But she couldn't help but admit that she'd rather fight with her spear than with a pencil.\n\nShe summoned two trustworthy advisors: Chieftess Amzina and Yaniv Litzhol. Both knew much more about economic matters than she did, and she asked them to explain what trade policy would be best for the Imperial Realm. Amzina spoke first, and was quick to explain how a liberal, open economy was the best for both the common folk and the government. If goods were allowed to flow freely, the economy would grow faster, ultimately resulting in more taxes and increased prosperity. The Re'emite horse had a completely different opinion, however. He reasoned that Zar-Hay was such a large nation that they were largely self-sufficient in many resources. If they allowed unlimited exports, not only would they lose all the potential tariffs, but raw resources would flow out of the country. It would be better to keep them within the national market, so they could be refined locally, thus driving economic development and lowering prices of refined goods.\n\nMeynsata did not really understand anything what was said, but had to decide which advisor was the more reasonable one."
zarhay.73.a:0 "Yaniv is right."
zarhay.73.b:0 "Amzina is right."

zarhay.74.t:0 "Everywhere At The End Of Time"
zarhay.74.d:0 "Not long had passed since Zonni's unexpected death, but the memory of him was already fading, shifting and warping. Some zebras remembered him as a merciless tyrant who ruled with force, while others admired him as the greatest hero of Zar-Hay since Zargitau. Thousands blamed him for the deaths of their loved ones, and thousands celebrated him as the Uniter of the Great Lakes. It soon became clear that these two contrasting interpretations of the past could not co-exist. One would have to dominate the other, and ultimately it was the duty of the state-sponsored chroniclers and griots to choose what narrative would prevail.\n\nMeynsata invited a certain famous griot to a personal meeting at a rather unusual location: Near the tomb of the deceased Zuwa. She accepted the invitation after initial hesitation. Once she arrived, Meynsata was already waiting there, alone.\n"Fassa Balleke, I presume?" the Zuwa asked.\nThe griot nodded and bowed. "Yes. It is an honour to speak with your majesty."\n"Spare me the formalities. I wished to speak to you about an important matter."\n"What is it?" She looked at the grass-covered burial mound. "Does it have something to do with my former employer?"\n"Yes. I have a simple question: How do you think he should be remembered?"\nFassa frowned and pondered. "Well, he was a... complicated stallion, to say the least. He was generous to his allies and ruthless to his enemies. I became rich thanks to him, but I know fellow griots who lost their heads for making fun of him."\n"Answer the question, please."\nFassa sighed. "We griots sing what others want us to sing, I am afraid. We do not choose our narratives ourselves, for it is a breach of our duty. We merely record oral tradition."\n"Allow me to rephrase my question, then. How would you tell Zonni's story?"\nShe took a deep breath. "I think I would say that...""

zarhay.75.t: "Out With The Old"
zarhay.75.d: "Nyaberi Zargey walked across the central market square of Zao, escorted by loyal armed soldiers who mere months ago had been farmers and crafters. Usually, this was the busiest hour at the market, but now it was near empty, except for a group of prisoners and their guards. It was deadly silent.\n\nNyaberi stopped in front of the prisoners and took out a cigar from the pocket of her suit, put it in her mouth, took out a shining modern steel lighter, flicked it with her hoof and ignited the cigar. All this time, the prisoners stared at her in horror and confusion.\n"Right, there we go. Now what do we have here?" she said and examined each prisoner. "A bunch of high and mighty zebras. Lovers of monarchy! Hierarchy! Tradition! Lovers of oppression and enemies of modernity and civilization." She motioned at the buildings around the square. "Look at this place. Everything is built out of wood and mud. 'Traditional architecture' or some nonsense. Disgusting. You fillies and gentlecolts ever seen Manehattan? Skyfall? Places with actual civilization? They don't even have 'markets', they have shopping malls. Towers made of glass and steel! People wearing fine suits, not some ancient rags. That's what one day Zao will look like." She saw how displeased the prisoners were with this, and grinned. "And this is why I need you out of the picture. To stop you from dragging every zebra downwards just so you can be on top, to stop you from judging others based on who their parents were. I hereby sentence you all to die, and quickly too. Guards, kill them all."\n\nShe deeply inhaled the smoke of her cigar and smiled as the prisoners wailed and begged for mercy, before they were all silenced by bullets to the skull.\n\nIt was a beautiful sight."

zarhay.76.t:0 "Traitors Among Us!"
zarhay.76.d:0 "Despite swearing oaths of eternal loyalty to [Root.GetLeader], many suspicious soldiers were ultimately ready to betray them and switch sides. These soldiers were unhappy for various reasons: cruel officers, low pay, neglect from the government. But the revolutionaries promised them many great things, and some foolishly believed them to be honest. They genuinely thought that joining the enemy was reasonable, but justified, that they would fight for a greater cause and bring about a new golden age to the Great Lakes.\n\nIt is unfortunate some soldiers are this delusional, but thankfully their number is relatively small. Nevertheless, this will weaken the [Root.GetAdjective] military and prolong the bloody civil war."

zarhay.77.t:0 "Triumph Of The New Order"
zarhay.77.d:0 "It soon became apparent to every zebra that the old order had lost. More and more cities and villages were occupied each day and morale was low, with loyalist soldiers surrendering in droves. Soon enough, the "legitimate" government had no way to enforce its rule anywhere, and was forced to go into exile.\n\nThose who had surrendered were officers and soldiers, but the former could not expect any mercy. Nyaberi Zargey despised the leaders of the army, many of whom came from aristocratic families. She saw them as loyal hounds of narrowminded oppressors and abusers of their own soldiers. So when she was asked what should be done with them, she gave a simple response.\n\n"Shoot them all. If you don't have enough bullets, then stab them all."\n\nThe soldiers of the revolution did not like them much more than she did. Across the Great Lakes, they could be seen executing their former superiors, with only a few doing so hesitantly. Of course, this meant that the army now had a severe lack of experienced officers, but Nyaberi cared little. What mattered was that the opposition was crushed, and she could now fulfill her vision freely."

zarhay.78.t:0 "Sabotage!"
zarhay.78.d:0 "Alarming reports are arriving from all across the territory controlled by loyalist forces. Unknown actors have damaged vital infrastructure in numerous locations. Workshops have been burned down, bridges blown up and trains derailed.

Repairing the damage will take a considerable amount of effort, and in the meantime it will hamper the effort to crush the rebellion."

zarhay.79.d:0 ""They are coming," Chieftess Aminata muttered to her family and loaded her rifle. "Quick, run away while I distract them!"\nHer daughter didn't seem happy with this order. "Mum, just come with us!"\n"No! They will chase us down otherwise. I will give you time. Now go! Once you reach the forest, you'll be safe!"\nThe daughter nodded, tears in her eyes, and left. Her brothers soon followed, leaving Aminata alone.\n\nShe looked out of the window again as the gang of armed peasants approached the house. Some of them carried torches even as the sun shone brightly above, making it clear what their intent was. One of the peasants knocked on the door roughly with his hoof. "Open up, Chieftess! We know you're in there!"\n\nRather than reply, she pointed her rifle out of the window and shot the zebra. He fell down on the spot. His comrades scattered in surprise and fear, diving for cover and dropping their torches. Aminata reloaded and shot again, but missed. By now, the peasants were returning fire, and a battle had begun.\n\nIt lasted for several minutes, with dozens of gunshots echoing in the spacious courtyard of Aminata's adobe home. While she was reloading, one of the peasants grabbed a torch and threw it at the window. It landed inside, and she cursed loudly as it set the floor on fire. She retreated, and when the peasants realized this, they rushed to break down the door.\n\nAminata was running low on bullets and figured she had given enough of a delay to her family. She went down the stairs and decided to go after her foals while the peasants were busy getting inside. But when she came out of the backdoor, she stopped in shock and almost dropped her rifle.\n\nGeneral Zaberi Ganji of the revolutionary army was standing before her, with all her foals being held hostage by armed peasants. Zaberi grinned. "Thought you could trick us so easily, huh? I had your home surrounded from all directions. And this is what my brave soldiers caught."\n"Let them go!" Aminata screamed and pointed her rifle at the general.\nZaberi was unfazed and shrugged. "Sure, if you drop your weapon."\nSeeing her crying foals, Aminata gritted her teeth and obeyed.\n"Good! See, even a Chieftess can learn to take orders from a former slave!" Zaberi said, laughed, and shot Aminata in the head with her pistol."

He is a wise and just leader, punishing those who misbehave and rewarding those who not only fulfill his orders, but innovate and outsmart the enemy. It appears he has extensively studied military strategy and tactics, forming elaborate plans that impress even Zonni.\n\nEven the chiefs who distrusted foreigners began to like him. Some even claimed he was an honorary Zar-Hay and thus deserved their respect. Zonni was pleased with this news and felt proud of his general. He even considered giving a rare gift of kola nuts. After all, while he was ruthless to his enemies, he was generous to his allies. However, he was displeased to hear that the general actively discouraged his soldiers from being harsh on the enemy populace, sometimes even disobeying Zonni's explicit orders. Nonetheless Ture was too good of a general to lose, so Zonni tolerated this behaviour. At least for now, while he needed him."

Or just shoot them."\nThey stared at her.\n"But I haven't forgotten my kin. My fellow merchants, outcasts of society. How could I forget? You raised me as a merchant, taught me how to trade and barter, sent me out into the world. How could I not be forever grateful?" She smiled subtly.\n"So... we're safe?"\n"Of course."

You've always just tried to appease me so I wouldn't try to... do this."\n"Bene, no, I... you're my cousin. We're family. And I strive to treat all my relatives well."\n"You never did. You never truly cared about me as I was the 'black sheep of the family' and all that. You saw what the Mazwians did to me and you did nothing. And now you lie and think I'll believe you? I might be naïve, but I am also God. And I can read your thoughts."\n"No, Bene, this is lunacy! You are just a zebra like everyone else!"\nHe appeared offended. "I've never been like everyone else. That was always the problem. But I don't care. I've turned it to my strength. Now give up your Royal Signet Ring, or I'll pry it from your cold dead hooves!"\nAzkhai tried to contain his fury and sighed as he realized it was all in vain. "Fine. If I cannot convince you to stop this madness, then allow me to say this: Put your subjects ahead of yourself and your ego."\nBene snorted angrily and said nothing as he forcefully pulled the ring from Azkhai's leg. The crowd cheered as he walked away to his royal retinue, and asked them to escort him to an island in the lake, infested with mosquitoes and toads, that had a small cottage. There, he would spend the rest of his life."

zarhay.90.d:0 "Ever since moving to the royal palace in Zao, Azkhai's son Muza had picked up a habit of sending formal letters to everyone else, rather than having face-to-face conversations. One day, his father discovered that this habit extended even to him.\n\nA courier presented him a scroll that had been signed by his son. When Azkhai opened it and saw it, he asked "Did you really deliver this down the hallway? His room isn't that far away from mine."\nThe courier nodded, saluted him and went away.\nAzkhai sighed, put on his reading glasses and read the scroll. It said:\n\nDear Father,\n\nI am humbly requesting you to grant me the position of royal treasurer. The zebra who currently holds the position once served under the dreaded despoiler Zonni Zolon. I do not believe he can be trusted, and instead, you should entrust the duty to me. I have recently read several tomes about economics and managing funds, so I am well prepared for this task. Allow me to prove to you that I will one day be a capable ruler of Zar-Hay.\n\nBest regards,\nYour loving son and primary heir\nMuza Zughe"

zarhay.91.t:0 "Disappearing Funds"
zarhay.91.d:0 "One of the cogs in Zar-Hay's bureaucratic machine delivered a worrying report to the King. It claimed that a significant amount of funds have gone missing from the royal treasury. It was not easy to detect, but somewhere along the way from the taxpayer to the coffers, a lot of wealth has inexplicably gone missing. The King swiftly ordered a thorough investigation to root out suspected corruption. Unfortunately, the trail ultimately led to none other than the royal treasurer himself: Muza Zughe, the King's son.\n\nIt seems Muza can no longer be trusted to handle large quantities of gold and other treasure as he seemingly claims it for himself and hides it away. Having royal blood, he is unlikely to receive a harsh punishment, but he should at the very least lose his position. However, if that is done he will likely be very upset and claim to be innocent, even if there is concrete evidence of his misdeeds. Does the King really want to anger his beloved son?"

zarhay.92.d:0 "Ever since arriving in Zao, Zin has been a busy zebra. She has made contacts and forged friendships with almost every notable person in the kingdom. She's already made Chieftess Amzina into a close ally and was lately seen talking to Chief Quaggo as well, who's one of the King's most loyal subjects. While on the surface all this seems innocuous, Azkhai is well aware of the purpose. Zin is building up her support base to rival his own, and might one day use it to overthrow him. After all, she has a strong claim on the throne thanks to being his little sister.\n\nOf course, Zin has done nothing against the law, so there is little that can be done about this. One option is to leverage the king's political influence to sway his subjects and ensure their loyalty. This would require a considerable amount of time and effort. It might be fine to simply ignore Zin's actions for now and wait until she crosses some red line that can be used as an excuse to contain her ambitions."

zarhay.93.d:0 "While Bene was seen as an outcast by his family, he was by no means asocial (like Azkhai's son was). He constantly tried to befriend people and even had his own personal quest to find a wife, to no avail. So after he arrived in Zao, he started going out to the city and interacting with the inhabitants. At first, he was seen as a strange person, and was soon publicly mocked and shunned. But something strange happened: Bene began angrily rambling on the city square about how he was God and warned everyone about the upcoming "dimensional merge", whatever that meant. And some zebras listened to him and were fascinated by what he said.\n\nSoon his audience grew. Some zebras were there because they found him amusing, but a worrying number of zebras especially from the lower castes took his words seriously and saw his erratic behaviour as a sign of a divine blessing. A genuine religious cult was forming around him, who saw Bene as some kind of prophet. He was more than happy about this as he thought his beliefs were validated and his inflated ego was soothed.\n\nWhen Azkhai heard of this, he was very concerned. He thought these "Devotees of Beghe" were little more than enablers and soothsayers who are reinforcing Bene's delusions and worsening his mental illness. He felt like he had to intervene in some way and encourage zebras to stop supporting Bene. However, he was also well aware that this would anger his cousin and deteriorate their relationship. Perhaps what mattered most was the fact that Bene seemed to be much happier now."

zarhay.94.t:0 "Backlash Of The Lashers"
zarhay.94.d:0 "Azkhai's announcement that the purchase and ownership of slaves had just been outlawed in all the land controlled by his Kingdom was a shock to many zebras. It was a bold and unexpected move, wiping away centuries old traditions within a moment. While abolitionists and former slaves celebrated and the zebras of Ugabi, Macigena, Hayzebland and Timbucktu were happy with the news, many others had the opposite reaction.\n\nThose zebras who participated in slave trade or employed large numbers of slaves in their mines and farms were dismayed by the change. They were now forced to stop buying or selling slaves and had to start paying salaries to their former slaves. This instantly drove thousands of zebras into sudden poverty and bankruptcy. In addition, many slaves lost their jobs upon emancipation and were now unemployed, no longer even receiving free housing and food like they previously had.\n\nWhile it was clear that slavery would not be reinstated, a few zebras still decided to agitate for it, or at least protest that the abolition had been done too fast. There were even rumours of a group of radical reactionaries who would use violence and coercion to maintain slavery even if it was illegal. The fallout from the abolition concerned Azkhai, and he pondered if he had to do something to alleviate its effects, even if it meant helping former slave owners."

zarhay.95.d:0 "Azkhai was walking down a hallway in his palace, headed to the dining chamber, when Chief Quaggo appeared in front of him and urged them to speak in private. They entered a room and asked the servants in it to leave.\n"What is the matter, Chief?" Azkhai asked politely.\n"That old hag, your sister," he said in a hushed tone, "she tried to get me on her side. Spoke sweet things and promised the world if I abandoned you, my King, and supported her claim to the throne. I pretended that I was interested, but you know well that I would never betray you!"\nAzkhai nodded. "I know all this. The King has eyes and ears in many places."\nQuaggo's brow creased, but only slightly. "Ah. Well, you get the point. Your sister is causing trouble. In fact, your son and your cousin seem troublesome as well."\n"Yes, yes. Do not worry, I will take care of them."\n"Oh? Do you mean... take care of them as in murder them?"\nAzkhai's face contorted in both shock and anger. "What?! No, never! I would never mean it that way."\nQuaggo tilted his head. "Why not? Just hire a competent assassin and secure your rule. You have better relatives further down the line of succession, like your daughter. She's a real sweetheart."\n"No, Quaggo, no. They're all my family, and I love them despite their flaws. I would rather strike myself down than hurt them in any way."\n"I... see. Well, it's painful to admit, but I worry you may be too soft in this regard. Sentimentality might lead you to lose your throne."\n"So be it. I would rather be a commoner than a kinslayer."\nQuaggo sighed, then bowed. "God bless your heart. You will always be my King, no matter what happens.""

zarhay.96.t:0 "A Blossoming Friendship"
zarhay.96.d:0 "The new King of Zar-Hay had a close relationship with Re'em, having led his family there after the collapse of the Imperial Mazwi. He had not spent much time there, leaving soon after across the border into Zar-Hay to build up his support and prepare to take his throne, but was nevertheless fond of the country and was especially thankful to Re'emites for keeping his family safe for so many years. However, as much as he wished to personally revisit Re'em, he was afraid to leave the country as then one of his relatives could overthrow him while he was away. Instead, he sent a group of envoys and aristocrats, who arrived with an entire caravan full of gifts.\n\nThe horses and zebras of Re'em received them with great jubilation, especially as they freely distributed nuggets of gold from the Buckure mines. Relations had warmed up after slavery had been swiftly abolished by King Azkhai and the Re'emites viewed his representatives positively. [REE.GetLeader] held a ceremony and the two sides exchanged gifts. As a sign of hospitality, the Zar-Hay zebras were invited to enjoy a traditional meal consisting of wheat bread, figs, pomegranates and plentiful wine.\n\nAfter the formalities, negotiations were held and many hooves were shaken. Multiple treaties were signed, and Re'em agreed to not only continue economic assistance but to expand it. They even agreed to a treaty where both nations guaranteed each other's independence, without formally allying militarily. The diplomacy was productive, and as a result Re'em and Zar-Hay were closer to each other than ever before."
zarhay.96.a:0 "A toast to friendship!"

zarhay.97.t:0 "An Unexpected Death"
zarhay.97.d:0 "Surprising news came from the military: Zonni Zolon, the former Regent of Zar-Hay, the uniter of the Great Lakes and a controversial figure in general, had died. His health had rapidly deteriorated in the recent weeks, but he refused to leave his soldiers and died on his bed in a barracks building. He left behind no living relatives. A medical inspection was made on his body by Re'emite doctors and they determined that the cause of his death was cancer. They found a large malignant tumour in his neck that had ultimately killed him.\n\nBecause he had no family, there was no one to claim his remains. Due to his importance as a person, [Root.GetLeader] ultimately claimed the body so they could decide what to do with it. Chieftess Meynsata, who had fought alongside him previously, asked for him to be buried next to his father's burial mound outside Zao. However, Chief Quaggo protested and said it would create a pilgrimage site for his more radical supporters who had approved of his violent methods. Rather, Zonni's body should simply be cremated and the ashes scattered into the sacred wind, and any mentions of him erased from historical records. It is known he had held personal disdain towards Zonni, so his suggestion was biased. Nonetheless, it's true many of Zonni's followers were ruthless zebras who had executed his orders without question.\n\n[Root.GetLeader] held mixed feelings about him. While it is true he had been a cruel half-blood despot, ultimately he had stepped down from his throne and allowed [Root.GetLeader] to claim what was rightfully theirs. Clearly, Zonni had had some sense of honour. Perhaps he deserved a proper burial? Or maybe he just deserved to be forgotten."
zarhay.97.a:0 "Let's just put him in a mound and be done with it."

zarhay.98.t:0 "Rumours Of Blindness"
zarhay.98.d:0 "It is no secret that Azkhai is an aging zebra. However, what is secret is the fact that his eyesight has been rapidly deteriorating. While the King has his aides to help him and can use reading glasses bought from abroad, the real problem is the fact that according to tradition, a blind King cannot rule. Not only that, but it is widely seen as a bad omen, doubly so if a King is in question.\n\nSo far Azkhai had been able to keep his secret rather well, but unfortunately he stumbled on some stairs in the Palace right in front of his court. Not only that, but some servant had leaked the fact that he uses reading glasses whenever he has to read documents. It did not take long for rumours to spread like wildfire and many soon believed the King was becoming blind.\n\nWhen Azkhai's relatives heard of this, they realized the King's legitimacy was now quickly eroding. They used this to their advantage, gathering their supporters and asserting their claims to the throne. After all, if the King was becoming blind, he'd have to abdicate, and that meant he urgently needed an heir."
zarhay.98.a:0 "We swear, there's nothing wrong with his eyesight!"

zarhay.99.t:0 "A New Ideology"
zarhay.99.d:0 "With the new import of industrial machines came a need for workers to operate them. Many zebras (especially former slaves, who now had the freedom to move wherever they wished) began migrating from impoverished countryside villages into cities that offered many new jobs. Unfortunately, the managers of the industrial machinery thought they could increase profits by offering low salaries for their workers. The work was hard and dangerous, but the compensation was minimal, and as a result some workers were upset.\n\nOne zebra saw this unhappiness and sought to exploit it. She was a proponent of a dangerous ideology that was clearly inspired by foreign ideas of revolution and communalization of property. Travelling from one city to another and holding rousing speeches in each, she quickly built up her own organization which was called the Revolutionary Liberation Front. Some of her speeches openly opposed the monarchic rule of Azkhai, yet he did not persecute her, thinking it would do little to help. Clearly something would have to be done about the unrest among the workers, but it would take a while. In the meantime, the revolutionary movement would continue to grow."

King Azkhai however had little interest in maintaining the current system indefinitely. He saw it as a temporary, hasty solution that would eventually need to be replaced with something better. For now, he needed the governors and wanted to assure their loyalty for the time being, so he invited them to visit the royal palace in Zao.\n\nThe governors gathered in the courtyard and waited until a former slave, now a salaried servant, beat the djembe drum to announce the arrival of His Majesty.

This will likely result in you losing your positions."\nThe governors had mixed reactions. One sighed in relief, another frowned in anger.\n"Worry not, however.

The King wisely appointed all of them, picking trusted zebras who he knew were competent. One of them was his oldest daughter, Harakoy Zughe, who was appointed as Timbucktu-Farma, the governor of the newly created Timbucktu province. It was a coveted position as the city was prosperous and famous, even if governors themselves only had limited powers. Nevertheless, the ability to tax the local trade routes was a lucrative prospect. But it also invited corruption, so Azkhai had chosen his beloved daughter who could be trusted.\n\nUnfortunately, Harakoy's older brother and the primary heir to the throne, Muza Zughe, was upset with this. He claimed that the governorship belonged to him, and that Azkhai was foolish not to give his oldest offspring any governorates to rule over. He claimed that it would allow him to hone his skills as a ruler, which would be important for the future. Yet Azkhai sensed his true motivation: Gold. If he would swap Harakoy with Muza, it was likely that some tariffs would go missing on their way to Zao and the royal treasury. Muza was still right about needing experience in rulership, so it was a hard decision to make. Could he really trust Muza with such an important position?"

He has secured control of much of his former governorate, which happens to include all the lands which once belonged to Alwani. He seems to have little interest in diplomacy and has refused any requests to negotiate.

I think we deserve some of your wealth too."\nAzkhai sighed. At least his son was honest this time. "I... understand, but you live lives of luxury, do you not? I don't think you need anything as much as my more unfortunate subjects do."\n"Wouldn't it be more fair to give every zebra their fair share, father? Perhaps we can receive less than the needy ones, but still, everyone has their needs, rich or not. The poor have need for food and clothing and so do the rich.

zarhay.112.d:0 "The upper castes of Zar-Hay, consisting of hereditary aristocrats, wind-singers, bureaucrats and proud warrior families, were not pleased with the abolishment of the caste system. While their privileges remained, now it was possible for any zebra to become a bureaucrat or a chieftain as long as they were qualified for it. Not only that, but lower castes or even zebras formerly outside the caste system could now more easily gain societal status. Merchants were the most prominent example, as they were wealthy but had been seen as outcasts due to not belong to any caste. Now they threatened to become the new dominant political class in Zar-Hay.\n\nZin Zughe, the King's sister, saw this paranoia and dissatisfaction and sought to take advantage of it. She contacted many members of the upper caste and with their cooperation wrote a formal demand for Azkhai. A courier presented it to the King, and it read:\n\nYour Majesty,\n\nThe recent abolishment of the caste system threatens the very foundations of Zar-Hay society. The traditional hierarchy ensured order and that every zebra knew their place. Now, due to your changes, the merchants see themselves as the new masters of the nation, despite lacking any pure and sacred blood of the upper castes. This threatens societal balance and might cause new conflicts and rivalries to erupt. As your sister, my King, I beseech you to reconsider your actions. If you do not wish to reinstate the caste system, then at least decree that the former lower castes should still respect their superiors. Some semblance of hierarchy should be maintained, for the greater good of all.\n\nSigned,\nZin Zughe, Heir to the Throne of Zar-Hay\nAnd\nThe members of the former upper castes."

Some Wind-Singers were concerned about it and wished to have an audience with the King.\n\nThe elder priest stepped forth before Azkhai's throne and spoke: "Your Majesty, with the foundation of the cult, we need to urgently decide what to do with your cousin's zealous followers."\nThe younger priest nodded. "Do we consider them heretics? Or do they follow the true faith, simply in an unorthodox manner?"\nAzkhai frowned. Religion had never been his forte, but these Wind-Singers needed his wisdom. He had to say something. "Hmmm... so far, his followers have been mostly harmless. Yet if we encourage them further by acknowledging their faith as legitimate, they might take drastic actions. However, condemning them as heretics could have the same result."\n"You see, my King?" the elder priest said. "This is why we need you to decide for us.

The doors opened, and sunlight flooded in. Azkhai couldn't see it, but he felt its warmth on his coat.\n\nAs the King appeared and was led to his golden throne, the aristocrats cheered and chanted his name. "Azkhai The Great! Long live the King!" they shouted, again and again. Three zebras in the audience remained silent however. They looked closely how weak Azkhai appeared. Was he even fit to rule the Kingdom anymore?\n\nAzkhai sat down upon his throne and sighed from relief, like if the walk had been a tremendous ordeal. He began to speak, but did so quietly. The gathered chiefs frowned as they could not hear him. Chief Quaggo noticed this and stepped forth, in front of the King. "Loyal subjects of Zar-Hay! The King has an important proclamation to make. Due to his high age, he has become blind, and according to the tradition of Zar-Hay, he must now abdicate."\n\nThe nobles were shocked, and stared at the King with wide open mouths.

The room was full of zebras, many of them chieftains, bureaucrats, officials, courties, members of the royal retinue and so on. There was also a group of griots singing and playing their instruments. It felt like a momentous occasion, and Muza was in the center of it.\n\nBut he cared little for the persons there, as his eyes fixated on the golden regalia held by the Wind-Singers. He galloped across the room in a rather informal manner, which raised some eyebrows, and admired all the golden items up close. They had once belonged to Azkhai, but now they were all his. He smiled widely. "Quick, quick, put all that on me!" he urged the Wind-Singers, who glanced at each other, shrugged and put the Royal Signet Ring on his leg. Muza was giddy and clopped his hooves together. "Yes! Yes! Yes!"

It felt like a momentous occasion, and Zin was in the center of it.\n\nShe slowly walked across the room, greeting every zebra she passed by, shaking hooves and exchanging platitudes. They cheered and chanted her name and she basked in all the admiration. Finally, she arrived in front of some Wind-Singers, who recited sacred words, put the Royal Signet Ring on her leg and adorned her in golden regalia.

Few of them were his supporters, and they did not seem particularly enthusiastic. Some even seemed sceptical and stared at him. Bene reassured himself by thinking about the fact that he was their God-King now. They were little more than pathetic ants. There was no reason to fear them any longer. He walked to the throne which was flanked by Wind-Singers who held the royal regalia in their hooves. Bene frowned and asked for his cultists to hold it instead. After initial confusion, the Wind-Singers obeyed him and left. Faithful members of his cult took their positions and placed the regalia on him, including the Royal Signet Ring.

Nozebra could tell where he had gone, thought it was likely that those who knew had been bribed to remain silent. Then soldiers began deserting from the ranks of the Royal Army, disappearing in a similar fashion. Rumours spread like wildfire and a certain restlessness defined the common mood of the Kingdom. [Root.GetLeader] ordered an investigation to find out what was happening, but it was already too late.\n\nViolence broke out in the west, and loyalists were either convinced to pledge allegiance to Muza or were simply killed. Soon enough, most of the western Kingdom was out of control of the government in Zao. Now it was sky-clear what was happening. Muza was planning to take the throne by force, and was influential enough to rally a large number of supporters behind him."

Unfortunately, many chieftains in the Kingdom appeared to agree with her and declared their support for her claim to the throne. Tensions were rising rapidly and provincial governors soon had to declare their allegiance either to the King or to the claimant. Many of them did not remain loyal. Then came the army, as aristocratic officers also rallied behind Zin, taking their soldiers with them. Finally, Zin presented an ultimatum to [Root.GetLeader]: Surrender or die."

Even during the coronation ceremony, they had protested outside the palace, chanting "Justice for Bene!" and "The dimensional merge is coming!". The royal retinue had quickly dispersed the protesters, but this served only to further radicalize Bene's supporters. They preached to the populace, appealed to govenors and soldiers, and generally rallied support for Bene. Apparently, Bene himself was not involved in any of this. But he had enough fanatic supporters for a grassroots movement to spread and sow the seeds of civil war. After initial hesitation, Bene declared that he was the rightful God-King of the World and that all should kneel before him. This signalled the beginning of a brutal uprising that had to be subdued by force."

zarhay.123.t:0 "A Scandal"
zarhay.123.d:0 "Word has spread recently about scandalous deeds done by Bene Zughe, the King's infamous cousin. Several mares have accused him of harassing them and generally acting improperly. When Azkhai heard of this, he was not surprised as he was already aware of his cousin's ill-fated quest to find a wife. His unusual mannerisms and inability to handle social situations with any kind of grace meant he usually alienated every zebra around himself, including potential partners.\n\nChief Quaggo however had an interesting proposition. This scandal could be used to weaken Bene's support base. If his followers heard of this, they would become disillusioned with him and stop supporting him. Of course, Bene would not be happy with this and his mental health might worsen, but it would be a cunning way to secure the throne."
zarhay.123.a:0 "Make sure every zebra hears of this."

zarhay.124.t:0 "A Couple Of Deaths"
zarhay.124.d_muza:0 "Muza was not a person who socialized much, preferring to spend time with his books and treasures. He therefore had no special attachment to most of his relatives - least of all Zin and Bene, who saw themselves as the rightful heirs of Azkhai. That was nonsense, of course: Muza was Azkhai's oldest offspring and therefore the primary heir. The claims of his aunt and cousin once removed were spurious at best. Nevertheless, he knew they'd continue to cause trouble in his Kingdom if he did not do something about them before it was too late.\n\nFirst he decided to take care of Zin, as he saw her as the bigger threat. She had formed many ties with the leading figures of Zar-Hay society and could leverage this to her advantage, but Muza had something even more powerful than relationships: Money. He secretly sent funds to many of Zin's primary allies, accompanied by a note that the King would be very happy to see her dead. So happy, that he might share some of his immense wealth. This worked, and within a week Zin had died after drinking a poisoned cup of palm wine.\n\nNext came Bene, the buffoon. He thought gold would not sway him at first, but later realized that it of course could. He sent him a substantial gift and a message that said he should use the wealth to convince some mare to marry him. He even recommended Chieftess Amzina. Then, he contacted Amzina and bribed her to arrange an assassination of Bene when he would inevitably come and visit her. This worked; Bene travelled to Anzongo to meet her, displaying his newfound wealth as much as possible and asked her to go out on a date. Then he had an "accident" as a nearby tree conveniently fell on top of him. Muza rewarded Amzina with additional funding so she could invest it in developing Anzongo."
zarhay.124.d_zin:0 "Zin always tried to socialize with all her relatives at least once, just to see if useful relationships could be formed. Two of her relatives, however, had proven to be utterly unapproachable. Muza, her nephew, was a withdrawn greedy hermit who clearly had no interest in even talking to her, while Bene was a degenerate lunatic who was not above flirting with his cousin. She could therefore not employ her charisma to convince the claimants to drop their claims to the throne. She'd have to find another way to solve this problem of meddlesome family members.\n\nFirst she decided to take care of Muza, as she saw him as the bigger threat. He was fond of accumulating wealth, which could be used to bribe any zebra in the Kingdom. But greed could also prove to be his downfall. Zin contacted some wealthy merchants she knew personally, like those of the Zargey family. They owed her a favour for her recent lobbying, and now she would ask for something in return. The merchants would send Muza a gift of golden treasures, claiming to support his cause. The treasure would, of course, be laced with ouabain poison. Muza fell for the trap and was soon found dead in his room in the palace.\n\nNow came Bene's turn. Zin knew he was strongly disliked by the Wind-Singers due to his unorthodox quasi-religious ramblings. So she contacted the ones she knew personally and arranged for Bene to be condemned as a witch. While Bene's followers protested, most zebras now hated him. Inevitably, a group of religious peasants ambushed him and burned him alive."
zarhay.124.d_bene:0 "Bene could still hardly believe he was King, but at the same time, it appeared natural and unsurprising. This was clearly his destiny, and to fulfill it, he'd just have to deal with some final obstacles in his way. These were Muza, who in some ways was similar to him but cared only about wealth, and Zin, a crone who liked to pretend to be his friend but had rejected all of his advances, showing her true face as a heartless monster. These two wanted to seize his throne away from him and denied his right to Godhood. They were enemies, and he would destroy them.\n\nFirst came a series of public threats against the two. Bene proclaimed that he would "personally deliver them to Tartarus" using his godly powers. He then ordered two dolls to be made depicting Muza and Zin. After they were finished, he pierced them with needles, stomped on them and tore them to shreds with his teeth. Unfortunately, this did not have any effect of them, much to Bene's surprise. He then drew a series of crude drawings of them dying extremely brutal and violent deaths and put them on public display. This didn't work either. He refused to doubt his divine abilities and figured they had made pacts with demons to protect themselves from his powers. This was enough of an excuse for him to order them to be arrested and executed by drowning in Lake Zao. Despite Muza's attempts at bribery and Zin's attempts at persuasion, this order was carried out by the Royal Retinue. Bene was proud that he had outsmarted the demons by using his temporal powers and relaxed, content in his glorious victory."

Tell me, how big are the veins of gold? How many tonnes can we expect to mine?"\nThe mare's excited expression was replaced with a frown. "Gold? Oh, no, we did not find any economically exploitable traces of gold. No, what we found was tungsten! Huge, easily mineable deposits of it! Not just in Buckure, but in Zairbanda too!"\nMuza visibly deflated. "Oh. Well, um, good, I guess? Are you sure you did not find any precious metals? Even silver would be nice."\n"No, your majesty. Just a huge amount of tungsten, that's all."\n"I... see. Thank you for this, information. You are dismissed."\nThe mare nodded, then slowly turned to leave.

Chief Quaggo, one of the prominent chieftains of Zar-Hay's central heartland, wished to speak with [Root.GetLeader] in private, at their personal residence in Zairbanda.

She could see that it was well-maintained and even had a little garden at the front. Thankfully the island's size meant that it was easy to find Azkhai.

However, he clearly recognized her voice.\n"H-harakoy? What are you doing here?"\nShe ran into the water, not caring that her regal clothes got wet, and embraced her father.

Harakoy did her best to remain by his side as often as she could, but had to focus on fulfilling her duties as queen. She tried talking to Azkhai many times, but he hardly spoke back, only mumbling incoherent words. To her, he was already a dead stallion, and she mourned his passing.\n\nYet one day Azkhai sprung up from his bed and spoke with sudden clarity. The queen was quickly summoned to meet him.\n"F-father? You're standing on all fours!"\nAzkhai cackled. "Felt like taking a stroll one last time!"\nHarakoy's eyes teared up and she galloped up to him so she could embrace him.\nAzkhai was taken aback by this, but nevertheless hugged her back. "I assume you've been taking good care of our kingdom?"\nShe nodded, sobbing into his robes.\n"Good, good. You make your ancestors proud. And more importantly, you make me proud. A stallion can pass away in peace, knowing his lineage and his life's work are secure." He chuckled. "Now, Harakoy, I'm sure you have a lot of work to do. Don't worry about me, my story has concluded. But yours has only begun."\nHarakoy nodded, then hesitantly let go of him.\n\nAzkhai went back to bed, closed his eyes, and smiled, one last time.

"What did you expect?"\n"Something more... orthodox, more similar to what Marks wrote."\n"Marks was a citizen of Equestria, and her book is based on the conditions that prevailed in Equestria. The Great Lakes are a different place, one more... backwards. The revolution needs to be much more thorough. That's why we need our own manifesto, instead of just using the Communist one."\n"I... I see. But the goal remains the same, yes?"\n"If by 'goal' you mean a perfectly equal, communist society, then sure. Yet utopias are not created easily. We have a lot of hard work ahead of us, and I expect you to continue following my orders. Because in the end, it will all be worthwhile."\nZaberi nodded, though only slightly. "Of course, comrade. Though I must ask... why did we spare the bourgeoisie? You didn't save them out of sentimentality for your own kin, did you?"\nNyaberi let out a cloud of smoke. "Do you think Zar-Hay was a capitalist society before our revolution? No, it was so backwards that it was still mired in feudalism, so the bourge-whatever weren't the main enemy that needed to be eliminated. This is a dual revolution, a working-class revolution against capitalism and a capitalist revolution against feudalism. And no, I do not particularly want to shoot my family. Not psychopathic enough for that just yet." She let out a dry chuckle.\n"At least you know some of Marks' theory," Zaberi mumbled.\n"Yeah, I can read. Anyways, let's get to work!"

In the mean time they were in a compound of the revolutionary army, constantly watched by armed zebras and taken care of by ideologues. There was little chance for them to escape.\n\nBut there was chance for someone to rescue them.\n\nOne night the compound came under attack by unknown assailants. The soldiers defending the compound, largely consisting of armed peasants, were woken up by gunfire and discovered that the night watch had already been killed. They took cover and fired back into the darkness. The gunfight lasted for many minutes. The foals were also awake, cowering in fear inside the main building of the compound as their caretakers tried to calm them down.\n\nThen the noise stopped. It became terribly silent, until someone broke down the door. Soon the caretakers had guns pointing at them.\n"Hoof over the foals, and we'll let you live," one of the shadowy figures demanded. The caretakers complied, the attackers led the terrified foals outside, then shot the ideologues.\n\nThe lights had gone out, so the foals didn't see the carnage all over the compound. The strangers led them away into a nearby forest.\n"Do not worry, offspring of Aminata," someone said to them. "You are safe with us now. We've avenged your mother's death.

She was going to accounce the economic program of the revolutionary movement, now that it had secured control of the Great Lakes. Nozebra knew what exactly to expect, as many of them had different ideas of what revolution meant in practice. One zebra, Zaberi Ganji, was hoping for their leader to stick to Marks' ideals of building true communism.\n\nEveryzebra turned to look at Nyaberi as she arrived, somewhat late. She walked up to the place where the throne had once been and where a wooden podium now stood. She adjusted her sunglasses, cleared her throat (it sounded like she should smoke fewer cigars) and began to speak.\n"Hi guys, how are you doing. So, economics. I know all about 'em, having unfortunately been born a merchant. And I have big plans. You see, how do I put it, we're screwed at the moment. Our cities are a bunch of mudhuts and most of the population still toils in the fields. We're several decades behind in development of civilized nations. And I intend us to catch up to them in a year."\nShe let that sink in by being quiet, grinning as the audience's eyes widened.\n"Yup, pretty crazy huh. But the revolution waits for nozebra. If some get left behind, that's their problem. And you might be spectical, but trust me, I know how to pull this off. All I need is for you to follow the program..."\n\nAs she started to outline the details, Zaberi's eyebrows creased. This wasn't at all what he had expected."

We have tried to follow Zaberi Ganji closely, but it seems he has caught wind of our spying operations and is acting increasingly secretive. At the very least, we managed to dig up dirt on some of his orthodox marksist supporters. It seems they're hoarding weapons and bribing officers loyal to you, possibly in preparation for a coup."\nNyaberi rolled her eyes. "How am I not surprised... so, use their own means against them.

It was Zage, the former leader of the royal retinue. Apparently he had somehow survived the officer purge and was now on a personal quest to redeem his lost honour and restore the Kingdom, or something like that.

In addition there was an innumerable amount of baubles from various chieftains and such. All the gems encrusted in them had already been removed, of course.\n\nShe was glad to see it all put to better use. All these trinkets were symbols of senseless waste and vanity. She thought about how many tonnes of rock underpaid miners had to excavate, how much raw ore had to be processed by underpaid metallurgists, how much underpaid craftszebras worked to craft the items themselves.

When she arrived in Nyaberi's office, she was already waiting for her, smoking one of her signature cigars.\n"Ah, General, welcome. Take a seat."\nMuza nodded and obediently sat down in front of her desk.\n"I wanted to inform you that because the state has gradually ceased to exist, your employment has been terminated."\nThe general blinked in confusion. "Excuse me?"\n"Didn't you hear the news? As all responsibilites of government have been taken over by state-owned companies, the state itself serves practically no purpose and has now been formally declared defunct. So, I guess you'll have to find a new job from one of the many companies which are now the only entities capable of running things."\n"I... uh... but what about you?"\nShe shrugged. "I own majority of shares in each company, so nothing really changes for me I guess."\n"I see... but is this really what our revolution sought to accomplish?"\nNyaberi sighed. "Do you want to keep your job or no?"\nMuza nodded eagerly.\n"In that case, congratulations, you've been rehired as my head of security. Now get out of here."\n"Yes ma'am! Thank you!" She stood up and saluted her, then left the office.\n\nNyaberi triumphantly puffed smoke from her cigar and relaxed on her chair. She had finally built a society of her dreams."

He got out of bed, put on some clothes, prepared some Abyssinian coffee and ate a Macawian banana. Then he rushed off to work, driving to the city on his new car. He had studed at the Institute Of Applied Sciences and graduated as an architect, so he worked at a brand new office in the center of Zornu. The old city center had been completely demolished only a year prior. Now he was responsible for designing even more new buildings that rapidly rose across the Great Lakes as the government poured immense amounts of money into state-owned construction companies.\n\nThe day at work was nothing interesting. While drafting a design for the facade of a house, he suddenly stopped and looked around him. Everyzebra else at the office was focusing on their work and wore almost identical clothes. Any small talk with them was ultimately shallow as their breaks were short and their supervisors watched them closely. Even now as Ezhe wasn't doing anything, he was concerned someone would notice and tell him to get back to work.\n\nHe had no reason to be unhappy, of course. He had a good salary, a roof atop his head and a shining car. Everything Nyaberi's revolution had promised had been given to him. Yet for some reason, he felt hollow and missed living a simple farming life with his tribe. He remembered the celebrations mired in superstition, which were now banned of course, but which had given him a sense of belonging in a community. His tribe had been like extended family to him as he had grown up alongside them. He had been poor, and lived in dirt and sickness, but now... something was missing.\n\nThe bells rang. After twelve hours of work, it was time to go home."

There was a knock on the door.\n"Come in."\nIt opened and Muza Nyawri, one of the veterans of the revolution, stepped inside. Zaberi gestured towards the empty seat in front of his desk and Muza sat down on it.\n"You are probably wondering why I summoned you here," Zaberi said. "The reason is simple. I wanted to be certain that you are loyal to the revolutionary front, not Nyaberi."\nMuza nodded. "Of course. While I did warn her when the coup commenced, I was merely fulfilling my duty. I did nothing to stop you."\n"That is all well and good. But more importantly, do you subscribe to her vision of the revolution?"\n"Uuh... not necessarily. Again, what mattered to me more was doing my job."\nZaberi shook his head. "That is not good enough. You must have ideological purpose, an understanding of the cause. Only then can you properly 'fulfill your duty' as you said."\n"I see."\n"What you must understand is that our revolution took place prematurely. According to Marks, socialist revolution requires the maturation of capitalism."\n"So... what do we do then?"\n"Nyaberi thought this meant she could implement capitalist policies. I believe that as the revolution was driven by the masses of the working class, it was a genuine revolution. We will therefore implement the dictatorship of the proletariat. This means nationalizing property and, counterintuitively, implementing working class democracy. The state will be maintained for now, until the necessary reforms are made to transition into utopian stateless socialism. Do you understand now?"\nMuza blinked. "I uuh... of course!" She saluted him. "Glory to the democratic dictatorship!""

"Caramel Marks was right... the communist utopia... the communist utopia is real!"\n"Actually, Marks denounced utopian socialism. But yes, the end goal of all socialists and communists is the same. It is this, a society without classes, with maximum freedom for all, and the opportunity of self-interested labor to rid any alienation. After all these years, we have finally achieved it."\n"I didn't believe utopias were possible... until now."\n"Well, there you go. All those who doubted the writings of Marks must feel very stupid right now."\n"If they're still alive, that is!"\n\nThey both laughed heartily as the red sun rose upon a real paradise."

Of course, the same room had been used to exterminate the Marksist opposition figures, but only very few zebras knew about this. Officially, they had gone missing. The protests that had followed were violently broken up and countless traitors had been arrested. Now, nothing stood in Nyaberi's way any longer.\n\nNyaberi arrived to the meeting late as usual, drinking a mug of coffee. She sat down, emptied her mug, took out a cigar, lighted a cigar and finally spoke. "There we go, now we can begin. So, esteemed gentlezebras, how are you doing?"\nAfter a moment of silence, one of them replied. "We are doing uh, fine, miss."\n"Great. 'Cause I am too! Anyways I invited you company bosses to this meeting to discuss the recent changes. As you know, the state has practically ceased to exist as you have taken over its responsibilities. I know that you all come from diverse backgrounds and joined the Revolutionary Front because you believed in a better future. And trust me, we are still pursuing that future. However, we no longer need to follow principles of Marks or any other corpse. The state was a useful tool to allow us to quickly catch up to more advanced and civilized nations. Now we no longer need it, and we can fully embrace modernity. And what does that mean? Well, as far as I am concerned modernity is what was built in Equestria, what I saw back in Manehattan. A society that has embraced progress, that has realized that competition drives innovation, where the economy is largely run by entrepreneurs and businessponies. There are some who reject this vision of modernity, but they are fools. The truth is, modernity IS capitalism. There is no alternative. Capitalism is an unstoppable force. It is here to stay, and it will stay forever.""

Formality was quickly discarded as Zarishat took out two glasses and poured grape juice into them while Nyaberi started smoking a cigar. She raised an eyebrow as Zarishat offered her a drink. "Juice? Interesting choice. I would've preferred coffee, but this will do."\n"And I would've preferred alcohol, but you can't always get what you want in life," Zarishat replied and cackled. She relaxed in her leather chair and sipped some of the drink. "So, what motivated you to fly halfway across Zebrica?"\n"From what I've read, our nations have much in common, so why not establish closer relations? Though I see you still keep up the facade of socialism, despite everything."\n"Why not? It's more amusing this way."\nNyaberi rolled her eyes and puffed some smoke. "Whatever you say. I suppose it'd be even more amusing for your 'socialist nation' to establish trade ties with [SON.GetNameDef], no?"\nZarishat grinned. "You are right, actually. Why don't we sign a treaty right away?

She looked at her family, who were all smiling happily. "Remember what I said all those years ago? That I had our best interests in mind. Well, I sure as heck wasn't lying. We merchants have finally taken our rightful place not only as masters of Zar-Hay, or even the masters of the Great Lakes, but masters of Western Zebrica.

"We should have never doubted you, dear Nyaberi," one of the older stallions seated said. "You have not only brought prosperity to the Zargey family, but to all merchants."\n"Yeah, she has made us proud!" another, younger zebra said.\n"I propose a toast to Nyaberi!" a third even younger zebra said, raising her cup.

zarhay.163.d:0 "After the state had been dismantled and the formerly state-owned companies formally took over, some had expected a massive revolt to break out. However, rebelling against corporate rule would've meant losing any chance of employment in the future, and very few wanted to take the risk. Besides, in practice nothing had changed anyways. Companies had already dominated life before the dissolution of the state, and the economy largely relied on market transactions. They had simply stopped pretending to care about building a communist utopia, and the only other ones who cared were fervent ideologues who were very few in number, especially after the mysterious disappearance of Zaberi Ganji and other Marksist leaders. Almost everyone in the Great Lakes simply shrugged and moved on with their mundane lives.\n\nBut not Ezhe Babangida.\n\nThe abolition of the state had been a wake up call. He was sick of his life, and he wanted change. Not revolutionary change, as the revolution had clearly failed. But he knew he could make things better, not just for himself, but for everyone else, so he sought out like-minded folks who were displeased with the situation. One of them proposed that they should found trade unions and recruit members, so eventually they could reduce the twelve-hour workday to ten or even eight hours, while increasing the salary. It was ambitious, but great things started from small acts.\n\nTherefore, during a short break, he approached one of his co-workers. "Hello there," he said with a friendly smile.

While some sought to contribute to science, others were little more than emotionally charged polemics. It seemed like the educated zebras of the realm had waited for a long time to finally vent out all their frustrations.\n\nOne notable example was a chronicle written by a Timbucktuan scholar, who recorded the life and deeds of Zonni Zolon. His text was far from being unbiased and it was clear the scholar wanted to make sure history would remember every terrible deed ever done by Zonni. When Meynsata heard of this, she was tempted to ban the text, but knew doing so would cause an uproar, so she left it alone.\n\nIn the introduction of the chronicle, Zonni is introduced with a memorable list of cognomens, epithets and bynames: "Zonni the merciless, the tyrant, the oppressor, the degenerate, the accursed, the great tyrant, the arrogant one, the accursed, Zonni the Godless, the profligate, cold-hearted, the despotic one, the shedder of blood, the notorious evil-doer, the killer of so many people, that only God the most high knows the number.""

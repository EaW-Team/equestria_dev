 PCB_equestrian_owned_industry:0 "Принадлежащая Эквестрии промышленность"
 PCB_equestrian_owned_industry_desc:0 "Пуэрто-Кабальо - богатая страна, и эквестрийские бизнеспони всегда считали её таковой. Благодаря инвестициям пони из Эквестрии наша страна познакомилась со множеством современных достижений вроде автомобилей и телефонов, однако большинство наших промышленных предприятий, ферм и шахт принадлежат эквестрийским компаниям, что делает иностранных пони монополистами на нашем острове."
 
 PCB_communist_sympathies:0 "Коммунистические симпатии"
 PCB_communist_sympathies_desc:0 "Вдали от взоров принцесс бедность, коррупция и социальное неравенство угнетают рабочих, фермеров и шахтеров Пуэрто-Кабальо. Вдохновленные Сталлионградом бедные пони считают коммунизм и социализм способом достичь светлого будущего.\n\nВ 1005 году коммунистические революционеры во главе с Багассе Кольтстро попытались взять штурмом военные казармы и спровоцировать всеобщее восстание. Но, к счастью, попытка переворота была пресечена с минимальным насилием, а виновные отправились в тюрьму."

 PCB_buckista_idea:0 "Букио Букиста"
 PCB_buckista_idea_desc:0 "Букио Букиста - капитан королевской гвардии Пуэрто-Кабальо. Он является убежденным сторонником эквестрийцев и опасным игроком в политике Пуэрто-Кабальо. При полной поддержке элиты материка он продолжает следить за тем, чтобы Пуэрто-Кабальо оставался райской гаванью для эквестрийских туристов и тех, кто уклоняется от уплаты налогов.\n\nБукиста родился в городе Фардо де Эно в 970 году. Он вырос в бедности на ферме и в возрасте 16 лет вступил в королевскую гвардию.\n\nВ 1001 году сержант Букиста возглавил переворот против коррумпированного президента Кесадильи во время хаоса, вызванного возвращением Найтмер Мун. Пони Пуэрто-Кабальо провозгласили его героем и присвоили звание капитана гвардии. С тех пор он стал искусным манипулятором и переговорщиком. Заручившись поддержкой элиты Кантерлота, Лас-Пегасуса и Мейнхеттена, Букиста продолжал доминировать в местной политике, убирая с поста любого президента, с которым у него не складывались отношения."

 ### EVENTS ###
 caballo.1.t:0 "Bagasse Released from Prison"
 caballo.1.d:0 "Bagasse Coltstro and his brother have been released from prison today, having served their seven-year sentences for rebellion and violence. A crowd of cheering supporters waited for him outside the prison gates and he was quickly ushered to a nearby hall where he made a speech, thankfully shorter than his four hour speech he presented as his defence during his trial.\n\nHe announced the publication of his new manifesto that he had penned in prison and his supporters had already printed. He also declared the formation of the Movimiento 13 de Junio, a new revolutionary communist party aimed at freeing Puerto Caballo from Equestrian capitalism.\n\nDespite his time in prison, it seems he is far from reformed. But without having committed any new crimes, all the authorities can do is keep an eye on him."
 caballo.1.a:0 "History will not absolve him."

 caballo.2.t:0 "Election Year"
 caballo.2.d:0 "It's Election Year again, and the island of Puerto Caballo is abuzz with discussion of politics. The four years since Presidente Ponsé Cocktail's election have been a breath of relief after three decades of political turmoil, and now the ponies speak of politics in earnest. With one honest election behind them, they are eager to exercise their right to vote once more. \n\nThe question remains, however: who shall lead Puerto Caballo into the future?"
 caballo.2.a:0 "Only time will tell."

 caballo.3.t:0 "The PAC Nominate Cocktail"
 caballo.3.d:0 "La Plaza de la Libertad is packed to the brim as Presidente Ponsé Cocktail steps up onto the podium amid energetic applause. Ponies from all walks of life have come to hear El Presidente speak, with rough-coated mountain farmers and well-dressed city ponies alike standing side-by-side as they stomp their hooves in approval. He answers their energy with an honest smile as he raises his hooves to signal for silence, and the crowd is quick to comply. \n\n"When I was a young colt in Sancti Stallion, I loved to climb the palm trees outside of mi madres's bar. Every day I would climb them, and she would warn me that one day I would fall and hurt myself, but I did not listen. One day, of course, I fell, and I broke my leg upon hitting the street. Mi madre was there in an instant, wiping my tears away and scolding me for my recklessness. She could not afford to pay for a doctor, and so I was trapped in bed under the watchful eye of my godmother while I healed. Mi madre, meanwhile, decided she needed a second job." \n\nHe pauses, scanning the confused looks from the crowd. "Some of you may have heard of her. Flower Cocktail became the second Presidente of Puerto Caballo, and it was her dream that no colt or filly should have to lie in bed at home sick or hurt because their parents could not pay for a doctor. She would come home every day and tell me of every reform that was rejected by her political opponents, and by the time my leg had healed I also shared her dream. Unfortunately, she was no longer in office. She would not bow to Equestrian business interests, and they would not tolerate her attempts to make our island a better place." \n\n"But now I am here! I have given you four years of harmony, and with your support I would give you four years more! No more will we bow under the weight of foreign interests! Four more years, amigos! A vote for Ponsé is a vote for harmony!" \n\nThe plaza erupts into applause once more, and Ponsé smiles brightly down on the assembled ponies. Stickers and pins and flags are placed in every hoof, all saying the same thing: Four more years!"
 caballo.3.a:0 "Four more years!"

 caballo.4.t:0 "PSP NOMINATES ROCA ROJA FOR EL PRESIDENTE"
 caballo.4.d:0 "Roca Roja, chairpony of El Partidoo Socialista Popular, came in to the editor's office here at La Granmare today to announce his intent to run for the seat of El Presidente. \n\n"We are all eager to see change for the better," he told La Granmare in an exclusive interview, "but that change should not come at a cost to our fellow pony. A peaceful revolution is the ideal that we should all strive for." \n\n"And you say that you can give the people their peaceful revolution, Señor Roja?" \n\n"Certainly. Why is there any need for otherwise? We are not wild ponies trawling through cantinas shouting and stomping our hooves. We have had one peaceful transfer of power already, and we can have another. If I win the election, I shall do everything in my power to aid the working class." \n\n"And what of foreign powers looking to exploit the island for its resources, Señor Roja?" \n\n"Business does not belong in government, this is true, but we can find other allies abroad. Stalliongrad will assist us, I am certain, and there is no shame in accepting honest help from them. We can build a new socialist republic without resorting to violence." \n\n"Is it true that you and convicted rebel Bagasse Coltstro were once allies?" \n\n"It is, yes, but no longer. I will not associate with that violent stallion." \n\n"Coltstro is on the record describing you as "weak-willed" and "cowardly." What do you have to say to him?" \n\n"If a desire for peace is considered weakness, then yes, I am weak. I am as weak as any of your readers, who I'm sure have no wish to take up arms and risk their lives fighting their neighbors. All anypony wants is a fair chance in life to raise their family in peace, and that is what I want as well. Vote for me, and I will put the power in the ponies' hooves without any need for bloodshed. Thank you.""
 caballo.4.a:0 "A democratic takeover is preferable to revolution."

 caballo.5.t:0 "The CSD Nominate General Buckistra"
 caballo.5.d:0 "On a rolling green hill overlooking the beautiful Puerto Caballon coast, a trio of ponies take turns swatting golf balls into the horizon. Here General Buckio Buckistra, Captain of the Puerto Caballo Royal Guard, rubs elbows with his two Equestrian friends, Filthy Rich and Rockhoof. \n\n"So, General" Rockhoof says, "are you certain you can get the island back under control? Textile prices have risen rather drastically since that last election." \n\n"It is no problem," General Buckistra says as he watches Filthy swing. "The ponies love me. I've removed troublesome presidentes before, and I can do it again." \n\n"What if you went a little further this time?" Filthy asks. He steps back to allow Buckistra to take his turn at the tee. "It is Election Year, is it not? I'm sure Rockhoof would agree to a sizeable bonus if you were able to take the title for yourself." \n\nBuckistra pauses as he lines up for his swing. Him, El Presidente? He hadn't considered it before, but with the support of the ponies on the island and his Equestrian friends, victory would be well within his grasp. He smiles as he thinks of himself sipping mojitos a new mansion bought with the money from his sponsors. "It will be done, for the right price." \n\n"Aha, excellent!" Filthy claps his hooves together. "When will you announce your candidacy?" \n\n"Let us finish this game first," Buckistra says. He swings, and his golf ball soars off into the distance. "Afterwards, the island will be mine. And what's mine, my friends, is yours." "
 caballo.5.a:0 "El General has only the ponies' in his heart."

 caballo.6.t:0 "Bagasse Runs for El Presidente!"
 caballo.6.d:0 ""The revolution is here, Molasses," Bagasse Coltstro says as he lowers his drink to the table. "Are you ready?" \n\nThe other stallion at the table raises a brow. He shoots a furtive glance around the dingy cantina before speaking. "I would not go in that cage again so soon, hermano. It would be wise to lie low for some time before we begin handing out rifles, no?" \n\nColtstro pursed his lips as his jaw worked side to side. "I do not speak of rebellion, Molasses. We have tried that path, but el gente are not yet ready to break the bourgeoisie yoke. No, we must replace our bullets with paper, and our rifles with pens. At least for now." Molasses cocks his head in confusion, and Bagasse smirks back at him. "It is Election Year, hermano. There is no better time for revolution." \n\nMolasses blinks, his eyes widening. "You? Run for Presidente? But we are criminals! They would not permit it!" \n\nColtstro snorts. "They can try to silence me if they wish, but words only gain more power under the weight of oppression." He raises his glass to his muzzle, downing the last of his drink with a smack of his lips. "It begins tonight, here. I will speak, and the ponies here will listen, and they will spread the word! Bagasse Coltstro, El Presidente!" \n\nBagasse storms out of his seat before his brother can stop him, and within minutes he has the whole bar raising their drinks in agreement. By the end of the day, the word has spread across the whole city: Bagasse Coltstro will run for El Presidente, and he is the only one who will truly listen to el gente."
 caballo.6.a:0 "He announced his candidacy in a bar?!"

 caballo.7.t:0 "Ban Coltstro from Running?"
 caballo.7.d:0 "#TODO Several members of government have put forth the proposal that we should stop Bagasse from running in the elections on the account he was recently released from prison. This will make many of the rich happy, but it will greatly upset the poor."
 caballo.7.a:0 "A criminal shouldn't be President!"
 caballo.7.b:0 "There's no need to be so hasty."

 caballo.8.t:0 "Rumours of Vote Rigging"
 caballo.8.d:0 "#TODO Roumours are spreading that Bakistra and his supporters are intimidating locals into voting for him and are securing polling stations for himself."
 caballo.8.a:0 "We should investigate."
 caballo.8.b:0 "Rumours are roumours, it's fine."

 caballo.9.t:0 "Evidence Rigging Found!"
 caballo.9.d:0 "#TODO the police have found evidence of vote rigging, enough to arrest Buckista."
 caballo.9.a:0 "Arrest him!"
 caballo.9.b:0 "Let's just sweep this under the rug..."

 caballo.10.t:0 "Military Coup!"
 caballo.10.d:0 "#TODO Buckista has launched a militery coup with support of the wealthy, police and army."
 caballo.10.a:0 "He wins!"
 caballo.10.b:0 "He fails."

 caballo.11.t:0 "Political Opponents Protest"
 caballo.11.d:0 "#TODO Buckista's political rivals are protesting the coup, claiming that their cause is unfounded and illegitimate'."
 caballo.11.a:0 "Let them shout. They can't do anything."
 caballo.11.b:0 "Arrest them!"

 caballo.12.t:0 "Buckista's Trial"
 caballo.12.d:0 "#TODO The Captain of the Royal Guard was tried in court today. Despite the best lawyers money could buy, Buckista was convicted of rigging elections and corruption thanks to irrefutable evidence. He has been sentenced to jail, and is not expected to get out for a long time."
 caballo.12.a:0 "At least he can't cause trouble now."

 caballo.80014.t:0 "Military Coup in Puerto Caballo"
 caballo.80014.d:0 "#TODO Recent events in Puerto Caballo have shaken the country. The dust has finally settled and it would seem that the loyalist, albeit rather... undemocratic Buckista has emerged on top. What should we do? On one hand, he has been known to emphasize his loyalty to us, but on the other hand, if we endorse this unlawful coup, it might inspire other ponies to try the same@."
 caballo.80014.a:0 "Demand he steps down!"
 caballo.80014.b:0 "Offer support for Buckista."

 caballo.80015.t:0 "Equestria Demands Buckista Steps Down"
 caballo.80015.d:0 "#TODO A missive from Equestria arrived today. In it was a politely worded letter from [EQS.GetLeader] requesting that he kindly 'step down from office and allow normal democratic elections to take place'. "
 caballo.80015.a:0 "Never!"

 caballo.80016.t:0 "Equestria Supports the New Government"
 caballo.80016.d:0 "#TODO "A missive from Equestria arrived today. In it was a politely worded letter from [EQS.GetLeader], stating that, as of right now, Equestria was in full approval of the government, provided that Buckistra did not get ideas about seccession"."
 caballo.80016.a:0 "Oh? Okay then."

 caballo.80017.t:0 "Buckista Refuses to Stand Down"
 caballo.80017.d:0 "#TODO Buckista has responded in defiance, refusing to step down. Unfortunately, many wealthy business-ponies have ties to him, and if we were to take direct action, then they would most likely be very upset. What should we do?."
 caballo.80017.a:0 "Leave him be."
 caballo.80017.b:0 "Cut off contact."
 caballo.80017.c:0 "If he won't go, we'll make him go."

 caballo.13.t:0 "The Sugar Tax"
 caballo.13.d:0 "#TODO a tax on our largest export good, sugar, has been proposed today. While the flat tax of 1 bits ber kilo doesent seam that much, it is predicted to cause a rise in the costs of sugar and sugary goods. But what is more concerning is that an amendment to the bill will cause all money gained from the tax to go to new schools build and run by the Royal Guard. Many in the PAC have raised concenrs that this will lead to the militery having a strong infulene over young Puerto Caballions."
 caballo.13.a:0 "This is a scam! Veto!"
 caballo.13.b:0 "The law must be passed!"

 caballo.14.t:0 "Ponsé Cocktail Impeached!"
 caballo.14.d:0 "#TODO Today an alliance of politicians managed to push through the impeachment of Ponsé Cocktail for various crimes relating to corruption. Citing his use of veto in the Sugar Tax law as one such example. Buckista has thrown his support behind Cuerda who was quickly sworn in as interim president."
 caballo.14.a:0 "Ponsé didn't stand a chance."

 caballo.20.t:0 "The Election of 1008"
 caballo.20.d:0 "#TODO "
 caballo.20.a:0 "Buckista!"
 caballo.20.b:0 "Cocktail!"

 caballonews.1.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]In a surprising turn of events, an alliance of senators in the Puerto Caballo house of Representatives pushed through the impeachment of President Ponsé Cocktail for various crimes relating to corruption. Citing his use of veto in the Sugar Tax law as one such example, they listed out various claims of his abuse of power and exploitation of state funds. The president was prevented from defending himself and pushed out of the parliament building.\n\nThe Captian of the Royal Guard, Buckista, has thrown his support behind Cuerda who was quickly sworn in as interim president.\n\nCuerda will become the 9th pony to lead the island since the fall of the dictator President Quesadilla 7 years ago."

 POLITICS_PONSE_DESC:0 "Понсе - сын второго президента Пуэрто-Кабальо - Флауэр Коктейль. Он  надеется исполнить мечту своей матери и превратить Пуэрто-Кабальо в землю обетованную. Страну мира и гармонии, где все счастливы и не беспокоятся о деньгах, здоровье или благополучии.\n\nПонсе родился в Санкти-Стальоне в 959 году и всю жизнь занимался политикой. Он был членом и палаты представителей, и мэром Пуэрто-Кабальо. При его правлении в городе снизилась коррупция и были открыты многие общественные службы. Во время правления президента-диктатора Кесадильи он был сослан в Мейнхеттен, но вернулся после переворота Букио Букисты. Он был основателем Партии Гармонии Пуэрто-Кабальо и был избран президентом на первых свободных выборах после падения диктатора в 1006 году."
 POLITICS_COLTSTRO_DESC:0 "Born in the town of Grano in 978 to a successful sugar cane farmer, Bagasse first became politically active while studying at the University of Puerto Caballo. He became highly critical of the government of the dictator President Quesadilla and even made the front page of several underground newspapers. This drew the attention of supporters of the dictator who began to threaten and bully him. This only drew him towards militantism.\n\nInspired by the works of Caramel Marks and Steel Stallion, he came to blame all of Puerto Caballo's problems on capitalism and the dictatorships of the bourgeoisie and that revolution was the only way to rid the island of cruelty and corruption.\n\nIn 1,004 he formed a group called the Movement and gathered fellow revolutionaries to support him. On the 13th June 1,005 he lead the group in an attack on the Royal Guard barracks in Luna de Compostela. The attack failed and he and his 122 supporters were arrested. Bagasse made a show of his trial, including a four hour speech defending his actions and denouncing the successive corruption in the Puerto Caballo government that gained him the sympathy of many ponies in the nation.\n\nHe was sentenced to 3 years in prison, but even behind bars continued his political activism."
 POLITICS_BUCKISTA_DESC:0 "The Captain of the Puerto Caballo Royal Guard, he is a diehard Equestrian loyalist and dangerous player in Puerto Caballo's Politics. With the full support of the mainland's elite behind him, he continues to ensure Puerto Caballo remains a haven for Equestrian tourists and tax dodgers.\n\nBorn in the town of Fardo de Heno in 970. He grew up poor on a farm and at the age of 16 he joined the Royal Guard.\n\nIn the year 1,000, as a sergeant he lead a coup against the corrupt President Quesadilla during the chaos of Nightmare Moon's return. He was hailed as a hero by the ponies of Puerto Caballo and promoted to the rank of Captain of the Guard. Since then he has been a master manipulator and negotiator. Having secured the backing of the Canterlot, Las Pegasus and Manehatten elite, he continued to dominate local politics, removing any President that he didn't see eye-to-eye with."

 POLITICS_ROCA_DESC:0 "Born in Manezanillo in 977, Roca Roja co-founded the Coummunist Party of Puerto Caballo along with his friend Sandía Pip. In 1003, Sandía was assassinated while in Abyssinia attempting to organise a communist uprising against the monarchy. Roca Roja became the chairman of the communist party and has since rebranded the party as the Popular Socalist Party in an attempt to win over more popular support those among the working class who disapprove of revolutionary action and still support the Princesses.\n\nRoca is often considered a coward or weak by some communists for his belief that the revolution should come peacefully rather than through revolutionary actions. This lead to a falling out with Bagasse Coltstro and his supporters."
 POLITICS_CUERDA_DESC:0 "Born in Remaredios in 945, he was an accomplished attorney and became the representative of his hometown in the house of representatives. A moderate he isn't a risk to any current institutions on the island."

##Initial Tree##

HYE_assemble_the_qaylid:0 "Calling For All Dervishes"
HYE_assemble_the_qaylid_desc:0 "The murderous Storm King lies dead in the far north, and his lackeys have turned on each other in a frenzied scramble for power. This is the moment we have been waiting for. Our Great Teacher Fahamka gathers all warriors, for it is time to take back our homeland."
HYE_organize_the_resistance:0 "Собрать наши ряды"
HYE_organize_the_resistance_desc:0 "When we strike we will not be engaging in guerilla warfare or raids, but rather we will advance on a wide front with forces in the thousands. We must be prepared for this, and make sure that our commanders are prepared to wield forces of this kind."
HYE_dedicate_our_souls:0 "Направить наши души"
HYE_dedicate_our_souls_desc:0 "Death is where the final word is written in your life's book. It is natural and good to not seek it lightly, but we must be prepared to meet it all the same. The prize will be our homeland freed, and if we must pay with our lives, then that is the price we must pay."
HYE_make_the_cause_known:0 "Напомнить ради чего мы сражаемся"
HYE_make_the_cause_known_desc:0 "Hyenia was arrogant, and she stood alone against the Storm King when he came. In defeat, she was humbled, and the Great Teacher has not hesitated to plead with our neighbors for assistance. Thankfully, we have been blessed with a neighbour both kind and just in equal measure."
HYE_liberate_our_kin:0 "Освободить нашу родину"
HYE_liberate_our_kin_desc:0 "Настал день, чтобы нанести окончательный удар. От щенков, выросших в беженцах и помнящих свою родину лишь по детским воспоминаниям, до выносливых пустынных псов, которые вели эту борьбу ещё до короля Шторма – все мы знаем единую истину завтрашнего дня.\nGeeri ama Guul: Смерть или победа"
HYE_request_help_from_the_gargoyles:0 "Request Help From The Gargoyles"
HYE_request_help_from_the_gargoyles_desc:0 "Between the tens of thousands of refugees who have fled to Gargiloya and the Storm King's rampage, the gargoyles have plenty of reasons to want to see the yetis pushed back. We just hope they will see that."
HYE_request_help_from_the_centaurs:0 "Request Help From The Centaurs"
HYE_request_help_from_the_centaurs_desc:0 "The prideful centaurs are our ancestral enemies, but they too have suffered the ravages of the Storm King. They would rather have us as neighbors than the yetis, and if they give us weapons for this struggle, they will have much to gain."
HYE_call_forth_the_faithful:0 "Tunnel Raids"
HYE_call_forth_the_faithful_desc:0 "As the conflict grinds on, we must acquire weapons wherever we can. Our kin in the deep tunnels have offered to "procure" some for us. Normally, this would come with strings and caveats, not the least questions from the former owners, but right now we are not in a position to be choosy." 
HYE_beat_them_back:0 "Give Them No Quarter"
HYE_beat_them_back_desc:0 "They can run as they please. We will be hot on their tails and rip and tear wherever they go. Hesitation today will let the strike again tomorrow, so we must move as fast as we can."
HYE_bite_to_the_bone:0 "Bite To The Bone"
HYE_bite_to_the_bone_desc:0 "The valleys and mountains of our homeland have always been a mighty shield, and it now serves the enemy. We must commit wholly wherever we strike, and push through no matter the cost."
HYE_wherever_they_are:0 "Wherever They Are"
HYE_wherever_they_are_desc:0 "The mountains and the forests of the valley are familiar to us, and if the yetis think that they can use these places against us then they will be sorely mistaken."
HYE_we_will_fight_them:0 "We Will Fight"
HYE_we_will_fight_them_desc:0 "Many of our brothers and sisters may have fallen in the struggle, but in death they have given us hope. Hope rouses the despairing, and gives them the strength to pick up where the heroes left them."
HYE_until_we_are_victorious:0 "Until We Are Victorious"
HYE_until_we_are_victorious_desc:0 "We are committed with our hearts, our blood and indeed our very lives to ensure victory. The yetis keep defying us, and we must redouble our efforts to send them packing back whence they came. No matter the losses, no matter the fighting, we cannot stop here!"
HYE_homecoming:0 "Homecoming"
HYE_homecoming_desc:0 "On the eve of our victory, a new challenge stands before us. We had thought the royal house undone, but its last scion - princess Jawharad - has returned to once again ascend the Malachite Throne. Our ranks rumble with discontent, and the Great Teacher has stated her intent to meet with the princess rather than to risk civil war following the war of liberation." 

##Moderate Furasho##

HYE_fahamkas_blessing:0 "Fahamka's Blessing"
HYE_fahamkas_blessing_desc:0 "Furasho knows who she is, and she knows from where she came. She would not be here if she had not been given the trust of the great teacher. She did not crave this position, and has come before Fahamka to officially ask for her blessing as she takes up the burden of guiding Hyenia."
HYE_gather_the_devout:0 "Gather The Devout"
HYE_gather_the_devout_desc:0 "The games of politics are all too familiar to Furasho, and she knows that no matter how just the cause, it will flounder if not well supported. If her reforms are to succeed, she must ensure that the people are rallied around her vision."
HYE_all_the_right_places:0 "All The Right Places"
HYE_all_the_right_places_desc:0 "A leader is only as strong as her closest. With Hyenia's apparatus of state in tatters, it must be rebuilt from scratch. Yet, a desert insurgency does not produce good ministers, and every position must be staffed with utmost care, so that neither mismanagement nor divided loyalties break it."
HYE_the_qaylid_state:0 "The Qaylid State"
HYE_the_qaylid_state_desc:0 "The Qaylid is the highest truth, revealed to Fahamka and disseminated by the dervishes. Furasho was lost herself, and as she now sees the light, she stands ready to bring this truth to all other hyenas."
HYE_what_we_face:0 "Суровая действительность"
HYE_what_we_face_desc:0 "The yetis are united once again. A new Storm King stands ready to lead them, and they will soon come for us. The terrors of their last invasion is fresh in everyone's memories, and we must ready ourselves for the oncoming storm."
HYE_emergency_conscriptions:0 "Срочная мобилизация"
HYE_emergency_conscriptions_desc:0 "We've seen what the end result of a yeti invasion is, and we must do everything in our power to stop it. Our people may be dismayed as the dervishes move to counter this threat with the same all-encompassing determination as everything else, but it must be done."
HYE_plan_for_the_inevitable:0 "Подготовиться к неизбежному"
HYE_plan_for_the_inevitable_desc:0 "It is not a question of if, but when, and we must spend every waking second before then well. Time is our most valuable currency, and we must spend it as carefully and wisely as we ever can if we are to survive this."
HYE_shore_up_our_defences:0 "Поднять наши щиты"
HYE_shore_up_our_defences_desc:0 "Konkaymaha is our weakest link, the open plains not giving us the protection that the mountains do, and we cannot let them flank us and seize Ciidacirood. Yet if stone and ice cannot shield us, concrete and rebar will."
HYE_every_hyena_a_gun:0 "Обыскать каждую оружейную"
HYE_every_hyena_a_gun_desc:0 "A sea of bodies will be nothing but water poured down the drain if they are not suitably equipped. Our old contact network from the war of liberation is still intact, and we must bring in all the resources we can through it."
HYE_dig_our_heels_in:0 "Укрепиться на нашей земле"
HYE_dig_our_heels_in_desc:0 "Every step of the way, every valley and every field, all shall be contested. The yetis are strong, and they are many, but with enough grim determination and preparation, we can bleed them dry."
HYE_preemptive_strike:0 "Preemptive Strike"
HYE_preemptive_strike_desc:0 "The yetis are still tearing at each other, and we have an opportunity. Waiting more will only give them more time to unite and strengthen, and so we must strike now, and deal with them before that."
HYE_assess_the_realm:0 "Оценить остатки королевства"
HYE_assess_the_realm_desc:0 "From the ruins of Qaybi Weyn to the burning fields of Konkaymaha, Hyenia lies wounded and bleeding before us. We must act decisively to heal the nation, and yet to do so we must act with knowledge."
HYE_the_yeti_problem:0 "Ситуация с йети"
HYE_the_yeti_problem_desc:0 "Тысячи йети переселились в Гиению после распада королевства. Они пришли, чтобы воздвигнуть новые дома на руинах старых, и с этим нужно разобраться. Многих из них не воины и не мародеры, а зачастую скромные фермеры и рабочие. Изгнание - очевидное решение, но оно не является истинно верным."
HYE_clean_up_the_surface:0 "Расчистить поверхность"
HYE_clean_up_the_surface_desc:0 "There are still hyenas living in the ruins of their homes after years of war. Before we embark on great projects of rebuilding, we must sweep away the rubble and ensure that the wounds left by the invasion are treated."
HYE_reconnect_with_the_underworld:0 "Воссоединиться с пещерами"
HYE_reconnect_with_the_underworld_desc:0 "Tens of thousand of hyenas fled into the deep tunnels, and have hidden there ever since behind collapsed tunnels and entrances. Qalbi Weyn is the great entrance into the underground, and we can finally begin digging to reconnect with them and bring them home."
HYE_teach_the_uninitiated:0 "Просвещение заблудших"
HYE_teach_the_uninitiated_desc:0 "Гиения все еще остается монархической страной сердцем и духом, и её нужно научить новому пути. Бытие дервишем - это не какая-то должность, предназначенная лишь для немногих, а духовная борьба, в которой достойны участвовать все гиены. Так мы сможем изменить гиен, а с их помощью и всю Гиению."
HYE_prayer_without_worship:0 "Prayer Without Worship"
HYE_prayer_without_worship_desc:0 "The Qaylid makes no claim to represent the voice of a divine will. Those who wish to worship their old gods can still do so, but they will do so in accordance with the values of the Qaylid."
HYE_find_a_place_for_them:0 "Find A Place For Them"
HYE_find_a_place_for_them_desc:0 "There is no such thing as a hyena who does not deserve a place in the world. All have their part to play, and all should be honored for it. In this truth, we create order, and work towards healing."
HYE_pragmatic_dogma:0 "Pragmatic Dogma"
HYE_pragmatic_dogma_desc:0 "Asceticism is virtuous, but telling a starving hyena that her suffering is good is not. There is one truth, but there are also many roads that lead there. Little concessions here and there will ensure that the transformation of our society can happen without driving the suffering to despair."
HYE_contentment_in_community:0 "Contentment In Community"
HYE_contentment_in_community_desc:0 "It takes a village to raise a pup, and no hyena thrives in isolation. The Qaylid's guidance shall be felt even in the smallest village, and no matter how far-flung, our people shall know that we're there for them."
HYE_meaning_from_mundanity:0 "Meaning From Mundanity"
HYE_meaning_from_mundanity_desc:0 "The dream of something new, something better, is so many times an illusion. When the thrill of novelty fades, you are left where you started. The wise know to find purpose in even the small things, and while there will always be those who seek the new, we honor those who can labour and thrive where they stand."
HYE_once_and_for_all:0 "Раз и навсегда"
HYE_once_and_for_all_desc:0 "Whether by luck or by foresight, we have prepared ourselves well enough that we could consider another option: invading them first. It would be the hardest war we've ever fought, but it would spare our lands the suffering."
HYE_the_paw_weve_been_dealt:0 "The Paw We've Been Dealt"
HYE_the_paw_weve_been_dealt_desc:0 "We stand where the Storm King stood, and all the lands the yetis held claim over are now under our control. Yet we have not come to pillage, but to build a lasting peace, and now we embark on the greatest challenge of the dervishes; redeeming the yetis."
HYE_organize_the_armed_forces:0 "Organize The Armed Forces"

HYE_further_aeronautical_support:0 "Further Aeronautical Support"
HYE_further_aeronautical_support_desc:0 ""

HYE_shake_off_the_rust:0 "Shake Off The Rust"
HYE_shake_off_the_rust_desc:0 "So much of our industry was left abandoned when the Yetis took over Hyenia. The Storm King's campaign and subsequent civil war meant all that interested them was the production of weapons. There is much to rebuild now thanks to this, but we are patient."
HYE_learn_from_the_hayzeb:0 "Learn From The Hayzeb"
HYE_learn_from_the_hayzeb_desc:0 "During our campaign of resistance, we learned much from the Hayzeb, and why should this end now? Our western neighbours may not have the great underground cities or mountain history of Hyenia, but they have achieved great things in other ways, and there is much to learn from them still." 
HYE_common_good:0 "For The Common Hyena"
HYE_common_good_desc:0 "Owning gold means nothing but knowing how to produce gold coins is knowledge, creating them is to shape the future and using them well is to show virtue. This principle is absolute and must be a foundational part of Hyenia's economy. Wasting money while our people could be fed and sheltered is more than waste, it is a sin."
HYE_develop_the_interior:0 "Develop The Interior"
HYE_develop_the_interior_desc:0 "The northwest was our sanctuary for a long time, and though the desert shielded us through being sparsely settled and developed, the Hyenas who live here deserve proper roads and bridges as much as anyone else."
HYE_fields_of_green:0 "Fields Of Gold"
HYE_fields_of_green_desc:0 "The river plains of Konkaymaha have always been highly fertile, but in the wake of the invasion they were largely left fallow except for small scale farming. It is time for these fields to once again be put to good use."
HYE_teach_the_jewlers_our_principles:0 "Teach The Jewelers Our Principles"
HYE_teach_the_jewlers_our_principles_desc:0 "The Qaylid preaches ascetism, and yet jewelery is one of Hyenia's oldest and most highly regarded arts. We face a conundrum here. Though some zealots would see us shut this tradition down entirely, this would be excessive. Instead, the Jewelers can be guided like all other Hyenas, and their skills and resources can be put to good use serving the people."
HYE_the_second_capital:0 "The Second Capital"
HYE_the_second_capital_desc:0 "Ciidacirood is the birthplace of the Qaylid and the heart of our resistance against the yetis. It has served Hyenia beyond well, and it would be wrong to let it fall back into obscurity. It shall instead become the spiritual capitol of Hyenia, and a mandatory place of pilgrimage for all dervishes."
HYE_word_into_scripture:0 "Word Into Scripture"
HYE_word_into_scripture_desc:0 "The illiterate mind is trapped, and through education it is freed. It learns how to grasp the abstract and the hypothetical, to question and to seek further understanding. Education therefore must be the highest priority if Hyenia is to be reshaped."
HYE_waste_not:0 "Waste Not"
HYE_waste_not_desc:0 "Every scrap of metal, every bit of coal and every drop of water serves a purpose, and making poor use of it is to misunderstand what it means to be a dervish. Everything we have must be evaluated and put to the best possible use, whether you are one or a million."
HYE_nurture_local_talent:0 "Nurture Local Talent"
HYE_nurture_local_talent_desc:0 "The Queendom was a pyramid, with Qalbi Weyn at the top and all others below. The talents and minds of hundreds of thousands were thus wasted, and we shall ensure this never happens again. Every mind, whether urban or rural, is a potential gem that we will use to pay for the future." 
HYE_strip_away_the_excess:0 "Отобрать излишки"
HYE_strip_away_the_excess_desc:0 "The Queendom was beyond lavish at times, and obscene resources were spent on palaces, statues and other nonsense. There are things that celebrate and inspire the common hyena, and there are things that is nothing but self-gratification for the wealthy. One can stay, the other must be torn down and repurposed for those who suffered for its construction."
HYE_the_value_of_effort:0 "Ценность усилий"
HYE_the_value_of_effort_desc:0 "To give it your all is to live up to your fullest potential, and this is something to celebrate. Knowing where the limits of one's being lies is to know oneself, and in knowing oneself, one can be in control of one's life." 
HYE_absolve_us_from_the_past:0 "Избавить нас от уз прошлого"
HYE_absolve_us_from_the_past_desc:0 "Прошлое Гиении было построено на несправедливости и жадности, и это нужно запомнить и навсегда изменить. Однако эти перемены будут происходить не в мастерских или на поле боя, а в сознании всех гиен."
HYE_repurpose_yeti_machinery:0 "Repurpose Yeti Machinery"
HYE_repurpose_yeti_machinery_desc:0 "For all the devastation and all the suffering that the yetis caused, they did at least rebuild Hyenia somewhat. It may have been to fuel further conquests, but it will aid us all the same. It matters not whence it came, only what we make of it."
HYE_electify_the_underground:0 "Electrify The Underground"
HYE_electify_the_underground_desc:0 "The deep caverns and tunnels below have always been our home, but they have not tasted the fruits of the new era. Even though they more than anywhere else would benefit from the ceaseless illumination of electricity, they've been left in darkness. Once this was acceptable, but no longer."
HYE_develop_the_coastline:0 "Develop The Coastline"
HYE_develop_the_coastline_desc:0 "The coasts were long the most prosperous parts of Hyenia, and with prosperity can come greed. We must continue to nurture and tend to these lands as well, and yet we must do so in such a way that they do not fall prey to these vices again."
HYE_lessons_from_exile:0 "Lessons From Exile"
HYE_lessons_from_exile_desc:0 "When you have much, it is never enough. When you have little, it can become enough. We learned this in the desert, and we remember it in the mountains. We must never lose this care and respect for the resources we use, and utilising these principles will help us."
HYE_give_them_new_purpose:0 "Give Them New Purpose"
HYE_give_them_new_purpose_desc:0 "Many along the coast have weathered these last years with grim determination, hoping to see the old ways reassert themselves one day. Alas, they will never have what they desire, but in their place we will offer them something else."
HYE_blessed_transformation:0 "Blessed Transformation"
HYE_blessed_transformation_desc:0 "Qalbi Weyn has been a splendid city like few others, and we shall make it shine once again. As we face the future, it shall be here to accept any and all who would come to her."
HYE_nationalize_home_industries:0 "Nationalize Home Industries"
HYE_nationalize_home_industries_desc:0 "The landowner has ever been the ones with power in Hyenia, but in recent years they have been challenged by a new kind of elite - the industrialist. We will entertain these new masters as little as any other though, and their factories will be put to use for the good of all hyenas."
HYE_all_for_our_descendants:0 "All For Our Descendants"
HYE_all_for_our_descendants_desc:0 "After tomorrow is another day, and in ten and a hundred years' time there will be yet more days to come. All are equal in importance, and we must not be seduced by the promise of quick returns."
HYE_proselytize_to_industrialize:0 "Proselytize To Industrialize"
HYE_proselytize_to_industrialize_desc:0 "We are ascetics, not reactionaries, and change is not a necessary evil but the eternal truth of the world. Those who build, invent new tools, and discover new truths in the world are valued and praised in the Qaylid."
HYE_want_not:0 "Want Not"
HYE_want_not_desc:0 "For what purpose do we tread so carefully, and measure the resources we use? Is it so we can gather all the saved wealth in a huge pit and swim around in it like hyperwealthy ducks? We do it all for all hyenas, and thus we must be willing to spend it to ensure they live good and cared for lives."
HYE_unified_in_mind:0 "Unified In Mind"
HYE_unified_in_mind_desc:0 "We need not have absolute consensus, at least as long as we all understand why we do what we do. We listen in order to understand, and we trust each other to do the same. In this, we build unity, and in unity, we build the future."
HYE_here_and_now:0 "Here And Now"
HYE_here_and_now_desc:0 "While the future always beckons us, the homeless and starving need help now, not in ten years' time. The near future promises great struggles, and we must rally to meet it swiftly and with determination."
HYE_united_in_purpose:0 "United In Purpose"
HYE_united_in_purpose_desc:0 "The Great Teacher instructs us to 'lessen the suffering, the division, and the bloodshed of the world' In this, we stand together as one, and though we may disagree on the methods, we do not disagree on the end goal."
HYE_sanctification_of_society:0 "Sanctification Of Society"
HYE_sanctification_of_society_desc:0 "The world is in a constant state of flux, with the potential of the future being forged in the present to become the legacy of the past. Every day, hour and second the eternal tapestry of the world will be woven, and living beings have only one chance to make each choice right. 'What is?' is an irrelevant question in the greater perspective, for existence is a process, not a state."

HYE_princess_returned:0 "Our Princess Returned"
HYE_princess_returned_desc:0 "Let the cheers ring from the mountaintops and over the valleys, for the last scion of the royal house yet lives! Returned from her exile in Senturya, princess Jawharad now stands poised to ascend the Malachite throne. Before she ascends however, she had pledged to prove herself, and she will only become queen when Hyenia has seen her ability clearly."
HYE_reconnect_with_the_homeland:0 "Reconnect With The Homeland"
HYE_reconnect_with_the_homeland_desc:0 "Hyenia is a stranger to the princess, who even in her childhood only ever saw Qalbi Weyn. Yet the princess is committed to breaking with tradition, and has embarked on a tour of the nation to beyond the gilded halls of the palace."
HYE_recieve_the_matriarchs_blessing:0 "Recieve The Matriarch's Blessing"
HYE_recieve_the_matriarchs_blessing_desc:0 "The tensions between the dervishes and the royalists run deep. If the nation is to heal, these two disparate forces must come together, and princess Jawharad has invited the matriarch of the dervishes, Fahamka, to request her blessing. There is no doubt that the Great Teacher will have many demands to make of the princess to give it, but Jawharad will hear her out."
HYE_our_sisters_under_the_soil:0 "Our Sisters Under The Soil"
HYE_our_sisters_under_the_soil_desc:0 "Princess Jawharad was fortunate to be able to escape to Senturya. Many others were not so luck, and of these many took shelter in the deepest tunnels of the cave complex beneath Hyenia. There, many of them have remained even today, terrified of what the surface holds. We must reconnect with them, and ready the tunnels for future use."
HYE_learn_from_our_past_mistakes:0 "Learn From Our Past Mistakes"
HYE_learn_from_our_past_mistakes_desc:0 "Hyenia's fall was not a foregone conclusion. Despite the bravery of its soldiers and the heroic way they met their opponent, they ultimately failed to counter the Storm King. The princess has ordered a thorough restructuring of the Royal Hyenian Army to ensure that we will be ready in the future, should they come again."
HYE_import_technologies_from_the_pact:0 "Import Technology From The Pact"
HYE_import_technologies_from_the_pact_desc:0 "Hyenia has spent years in ruins, and it has stagnated technologically. If we want to catch up with the rest of the world, we must bow our heads and ask our neighbors for assistance."
HYE_restart_industrial_development:0 "Restart Industrial Development"
HYE_restart_industrial_development_desc:0 "With peace finally returned, the Hyenian foundries and factories can begin to roar again. They have been left in a miserable state by these last years, however, and there will be much work needed to restore them."
HYE_our_dire_commonality:0 "Our Dire Commonality"
HYE_our_dire_commonality_desc:0 "During the occupation, many yetis settled inside the Queendom's borders. They are still there, and must be dealt with somehow. There are those who want to see blood for blood, but the question is if we have not seen enough blood already."
HYE_normalize_relations_with_the_gargoyles:0 "Normalize Relations With The East"
HYE_normalize_relations_with_the_gargoyles_desc:0 "The Ancient Pact's great gamble worked. They backed the hyenian exiles, hoping that the new monarch on the throne would be less belligerent than her predecessor. Princess Jawharad knows this, but she owes much of her success to them all the same. Whatever the reason, the Ancient Pact came to Hyenia's aid in their moment of need, and they have Hyenia's gratitude."
HYE_welcome_back_the_intellectuals:0 "Welcome Back The Intellectuals"
HYE_welcome_back_the_intellectuals_desc:0 "The Malachite Throne acted as the patron for hundreds if not thousands of scholars and scientists before the fall of Hyenia, and many of these learned hyenas are still out there. If we can convince them to return, it will help our research efforts immensely."
HYE_outlaw_private_armies:0 "Outlaw Private Armies"
HYE_outlaw_private_armies_desc:0 "The nobility's private armies were part of the reason for Hyenia's defeat, as the divided chain of command made our response to the invaders slow and ineffective. Normally, challenging the nobles' right to their private armies would risk rebellion, but when outnumbered ten to one by the dervishes, this option is not as attractive."
HYE_entrench_the_dervishes:0 "Entrench The Dervishes"
HYE_entrench_the_dervishes_desc:0 "They rose among refugees and exiles, creating a fully fledged army from nothing and carrying on a relentless war for years. The dervishes have much to teach the Royal Hyenian Army, enough that their teachings shall become the foundation of the new army training regime. They are the army's seniors and teachers, and the army will be eager students."
HYE_establish_the_RAWR:0 "Establish The RAWR"
HYE_establish_the_RAWR_desc:0 "The Gajar/Dhir Cad region, known as the 'watershed', has long been underdeveloped. As the princess landed here, she promised the commoners she met that she would not forget them to focus on Qalbi Weyn as has historically been the case. The founding of the Royal Authority of the Watershed Region is a goal to this end, and will dedicate itself to developing this region."
HYE_reconstruction_efforts:0 "Reconstruction Efforts"
HYE_reconstruction_efforts_desc:0 "Day by day, we labour to rebuild the queendom. Yet rebuilding is only the first step, and those who work to rebuild the society of before the war know that in its wake, something even greater will come."
HYE_bail_out_the_farmers:0 "Bail Out The Farmers"
HYE_bail_out_the_farmers_desc:0 "No hyena can live off scraps, and yet the farmers' fields have many times been long abandoned or turned to pure sustenance farming. Jawharad has seen their plight with her own eyes, and has ordered that they are given all the aid needed to ensure that the Hyenian countryside blooms once again."
HYE_appropriate_yeti_production:0 "Appropriate Yeti Production"
HYE_appropriate_yeti_production_desc:0 "While there are many who gladly would burn every last scrap the yetis left behind, we cannot afford to be so zealous. While they were mainly interested in machines of war, their armories can at least serve us now."
HYE_to_heal_a_nation:0 "To Heal A Nation"
HYE_to_heal_a_nation_desc:0 ""We come out of this last decade unbowed, but scarred and bruised all the same. I cannot take away the pain you have felt, nor can I bring back all that you lost. Yet for all the pain that has been, I promise you one thing; hope. Tomorrow will be better than today, and Hyenia will face the coming dawn with joy.""
HYE_rebuild_the_monarchys_image:0 "Rebuild The Monarchy's Image"
HYE_rebuild_the_monarchys_image_desc:0 "Queen Dahab was a capable queen, but a tyrant all the same, and for all the loyalty the throne held, many viewed her with fear or even hatred. Jawharad is committed to not repeat her mother's mistakes, and will give those who distrust her ample evidence of this."
HYE_out_with_the_old:0 "Out With The Old"
HYE_out_with_the_old_desc:0 "Many of the old institutions of Hyenia were rotten to the core, and despite calls to bring them back, something better must be built from them. "

HYE_join_the_ancient_pact:0 "Join The Ancient Pact"
HYE_join_the_ancient_pact_desc:0 "The Gargoyles and Centaurs have been our neighbors, many times enemies, since times immemorial. Yet the storm that battered all our nations has given perspective, and for all our old grievances, we all seek security and stability. If they would have us, we will stand by them."
HYE_seize_whats_left:0 "Seize What Is Left"
HYE_seize_whats_left_desc:0 "There's still much left after the Yetis' conquest, and none of it shall be left in place if it can be seized and put into use for Hyenia's future."
HYE_more_guns_more_safety:0 "More Guns, More Safety"
HYE_more_guns_more_safety_desc:0 "As part of the restructuring of Hyenia, we must accept that this is not going to be the end of it. The clouds of war will darken our skies in the future, and when they do, we will be prepared. "
HYE_the_queendom_renewed:0 "The Queendom Renewed"
HYE_the_queendom_renewed_desc:0 "The banners fly high in the wind and the tapestries sway over the tunnel entrances, all of them emblazoned with the red diamond and the white eye. In these lie a promise to Hyenia, a promise of continuity, yet also progress. Our past remembered, but our future guided."
HYE_ascend_the_malachite_throne:0 "Ascend The Malachite Throne"
HYE_ascend_the_malachite_throne_desc:0 "Princess Jawharad has laboured hard for over a year to show her mettle, and though many might have viewed her with suspicion, she has shown her dedication to Hyena's healing and prosperity. With the approval of her people and of the dervishes, Princess Jawharad now shall be crowned Queen Jawharad."
HYE_a_meeting_with_the_king:0 "A Meeting With His Highness"

hyenia.1.d:0 "— Их притворное единство давно исчезло и теперь они вгрызаются друг другу в глотки в борьбе за малейшие крохи власти. Даже внешние угрозы больше не в силах объединить их, — Великая Просветительница сидела на ковре, скрестив ноги, и проповедовала перед сотней собравшихся дервишей, сохранявших благоговейное молчание. В пещере раздавался лишь её голос. — Я слышала ваш шёпот и тот гнев, который вы чувствуете. Многие из вас желали нанести удар раньше, но представший перед нами зверь не из тех, кого нам предстоит победить в одиночку. Теперь, когда среди них царят смута и раздрай, мы готовимся к войне. Даже если находящиеся среди нас шпионы будут подстрекать нас к выжиданию, забрасывая громкими предостережениями и угрозами, они ничего этим не изменят, — обвинения в шпионаже заставили одну из гиен дёрнуться и начать беспокойно озираться по сторонам. Она медленно сделала несколько шагов назад, но почувствовала лезвие ножа, уперевшееся в спину.\n\n— Не двигайся, — достиг ушей гиены мягкий шёпот, после чего она почувствовала, как её охватывает паника. Шпионка даже не заметила, что кто-то стоял у неё за спиной! — После этого собрания ты будешь умолять Великую Просветительницу о пощаде и расскажешь ей всё, что знаешь. Поступишь иначе – и твоя история на этом закончится, — гиена молча кивнула, и невысокий, почти на голову ниже её воин резко убрал нож от спины и встал рядом с ней.\n\n— Дервиши! — По пещере прокатился другой голос, заметно отличавшийся от спокойного тембра Просветительницы. Высокая фигура, которая будто даже не замечала тяжёлой брони на себе, возвышалась над остальными присутствующими, — Мы боролись, проливали нашу кровь на протяжении столетий, но нависшая над нами война не идёт ни в какое сравнение с теми, которые нам приходилось вести до этого. Мы более не будем отступать, когда встретим жёсткое сопротивление! Отныне мы направимся только вперёд! Будем колоть, стрелять, резать наших врагов! Мечом, пулей и гранатой отправим этих мартышек туда, откуда они пришли! Мы освободим наш народ и поднимем флаг над Кальби Вейн, или умрём пытаясь! Смерть или победа, другого выбора у нас нет!"

hyenia.2.t:0 "Вопрос оперативных групп" #organize the resistance
hyenia.2.d:0 "— Когда всё начнётся, мы должны быть готовы как можно стремительнее продолжать движение на протяжении дней или даже недель, если потребуется. Однако важно соблюдать осторожность и не слишком глубоко уходить на вражескую территорию, иначе, вдали от караванов со снабжением, мы окажемся без припасов в окружении врага. Помните, наша земля уже долгое время находится под контролем врага, и он знает, как использовать преимущества местности. Теперь горы – это его стены, не наши, и это нам придётся пробираться сквозь эти естественные укрепления, когда мы найдём момент для прорыва, — используя обратную сторону когтя, чтобы водить им по карте, Фурашо указывала командирам путь через горы, которые им предстояло пересечь. Чувство, что она скоро вновь увидит потерянный дом, опьяняло гиену. Столько всего изменилось с той поры, как им пришлось бежать из Гури Дхурваа. Тогда Фурашо была лишь щенком, которая собиралась переродиться в Чиидачируде.\n\n— Даже обладая всеми припасами на свете, они и гроша стоить не будут, если мы не сможем пробиться сквозь линии противника, — услышав голос Масаски, Фурашо невольно начала скрести зубами, подняв взгляд на гиену на другом конце стола. В последнее время его силуэт то и дело мелькал в уголках её глаз, и тот, кого раньше называли Тенью Просветительницы, теперь говорил и действовал по собственной воле и, казалось, всегда вопреки Фурашо. Вновь и вновь ему надо было препираться с ней. — Йети не смогут покрыть всю линию фронта, и если нашим войскам удастся хоть где-нибудь проскользнуть мимо вражеских опорников, то тогда в ловушке окажутся именно они. Нам нужно двигаться настолько быстро, насколько это возможно, даже быстрее наших караванов, если потребуется, потому что скорость в этом конфликте будет играть ключевую роль.\n\n— Под твоим командованием было не более сотни солдат – не тысячи, как в нашем случае. Я уважаю твои достижения и прислушиваюсь к твоим советам, но сейчас у нас на лапах другая ситуация. — хоть Фурашо и говорила сдержанно, но внутри она всё-таки ощущала внезапный всплеск раздражения от комментариев визави. Масаска же продолжил изучать карту.\n\n— Однако мне не раз довелось пересекать горы. Да и к тому же твои "тысячи" очень быстро окажутся загнанными в ловушку, если им не удастся вовремя покинуть вершины. — Тень поднял голову и с неизменным спокойствием встретил взгляд Фурашо, которая непроизвольно оскалилась от злости и тем самым оголила острые клыки."

hyenia.3.d:0 "Даже спустя целую жизнь, проведённую в размышлениях и рефлексии, Фахамка без колебаний была готова признать, что никогда не знает и не будет знать что её ждёт в будущем. Когда она сидела под звёздами той ночью все эти десятилетия назад и только вступала на путь к просветлению, гиене казалось, что её жизнь будет скромной. Одна только мысль о том, что она будет сидеть здесь, будучи сердцем и душой многотысячной армии, была настолько чуждой и нелепой, что вызывала смех. Но только не сейчас.\n\nОна наблюдала за сидящими перед ней молодыми щенками. Те изо всех сил пытались выглядеть закалёнными ветеранами, но их неопытность и неуверенность были очевидны с первого взгляда. Они имели все шансы вырасти великими псами, но сперва им нужно было пройти через безжалостные склоны Гури Дхурваа. И хотя могучая Фурашо безжалостно тренировала их, а незаметный Масаска показывал потайные тропы и учил искусству держаться подальше от посторонних глаз, Фахамка знала, что многие из них не доживут до освобождения Кальби Вейн. Эти юные воины были глиной, из которой вылепят будущее Гиении. И именно она придавала им форму. Молодёжь молча смотрела на Великую Просветительницу, ожидая её слов. И Фахамка заговорила, вновь исполняя роль старой и могущественной гиены, которая отправляла молодых и полных энтузиазма псов навстречу бою и возможной гибели.\n\n'Простите меня за то, на что я вынуждена вас обречь, малыши'."

Зебра возглавила восстание и вместе с прочими освобождёнными рабами начала затяжную освободительную войну. Её отряды действовали в восточных районах Хэйзебленда и нередко сталкивались с дервишами. Между этими двумя группами быстро установилось взаимопонимание и дружба благодаря сходству идей и взглядов. Стоя спиной к спине, Освободительница и дервиши продолжали свою борьбу, помогая друг другу по мере возможности.\n\nБлагодаря личной решимости и рвению своих воинов, а также помощи, оказанной ей боевыми отрядами Масаски, Бамина взошла на трон Хэйзеба. Она не забыла об оказанной нами помощи и теперь готова с процентами вернуть долг. Она отправила..."

Под пологом ночи при свете лучин и фонарей гиены изучали планы нападения, размышляли и молились, сидели вместе у костров и готовились к тому, что случится утром. Чуть вдалеке под лунными светом в сторону гор двигались тени – это избранные дервиши Масаски занимали свои позиции. Когда наступит рассвет, они нападут с тыла и откроют путь своим сородичам.\n\nИ как только первые лучи солнца окрасили небо нежными цветами рассвета, собравшееся воинство пришло в движение. Многие тысячи подхватили своё оружие и прочее снаряжение, построились и выдвинулись по направлению к украденному у них горному дому.\n\nВскоре под светлеющим небом прозвучал первый выстрел, ознаменовавший начало долгожданной битвы."

В обмен на безопасный проход командира и его воинов с наших земель, йети готов признать поражение в этой войне безо всяких дополнительных условий. Вдобавок он готов оставить нам награбленные богатства и захваченных рабов.\n\nЕсли мы будем сражаться с оккупантами до тех пор, пока не погибнет последний йети-воин, то лишь причиним больше ненужных страданий нашему народу. Так что пусть йети возвращается на свой холодный юг и доставляет проблемы собственным сородичам, а не нам. Мы наконец-то свободны и можем вернуться домой!"

hyenia.7.d:0 "Огромное количество лодок причалило к побережью, и сотни гиен высыпали из них, направляясь вверх по склонам и посылая во врага шквал огня из автоматического оружия. Звучащие вдали взрывы и рёв винтовок смешивались с потоком приказов, криками и шумом множества лап, пересекающих каменный пляж. Всё это слилось в ужасающую какофонию войны, поэтому когда принцесса Джавхарад сошла с корабля на родную землю, ей пришлось приложить немало усилий, дабы выглядеть подобающе своему статусу перед подданными.\n\n— Ваше Высочество! — Крикнул плечистый офицер и поклонился принцессе. — Докладываю: йети отступают со всех своих позиций. Наши войска занимают гавань, а также склады с припасами, которые враг оставил за собой. При нынешнем положении дел мы будем готовы начать наступление на Кальби Вейн до наступления темноты. Вынужден признать, сначала ваш план выглядел слишком дерзким для реализации, однако он сработал безупречно! — Джавхарад одарила офицера слабой улыбкой и в ответ кивнула ему.\n\n"Её" план, точно. Тот самый, который несколько месяцев назад подкинула Маленькая Тень, посещавшая принцессу с тех пор, как она была щенком; план, в котором было детально описано, как йети запаникуют в случае атаки дервишей и побегут к границам, открывая свои спины для удара исподтишка. За всё это время Джавхарад так и не узнала, кем являлась та Маленькая Тень, но одно она знала точно: если и был момент, когда она взойдёт на Малахитовый Трон, то он наступил сейчас. Наконец, спустя двенадцать лет в изгнании, принцесса возвращалась домой, а вместе с ней и тысячи вооружённых гиен-беженцев, готовых вернуть свои земли, вопреки любым трудностям.\n\n— Солдаты должны знать, что каждый из них – герой. Сообщите им об этом и убедитесь, чтобы сегодня они хорошо поели. Раненых наказываю накормить с моего стола: я отказываюсь богато трапезничать, пока мы не закончим эту войну, — этого было мало, но сейчас принцесса не могла предложить чего-то большего.\n\nДжавхарад вслушивалась в удаляющиеся звуки боя и предвкушала грядущую победу. Вдали за холмом принцессу ждал Кальби Вейн, и вот, спустя двенадцать лет в изгнании, наконец пришло время вернуться домой."

hyenia.12.d:0 "— И как долго меня собирались держать в неведении?! — Прорычала Фурашо, возвышаясь над низкой изворотливой гиеной и пронзая его свирепым взглядом. От злости она сжимала и разжимала лапы, однако Масаска продолжал стоять совершенно неподвижно, бесстрастными глазами встречая её взгляд. — Мало того что эта слабачка, оказывается, жива, так она ещё и вернулась с собственной армией! Объясни же мне: какую игру ты затеял? Как я могу посудить, ты помогаешь претендентке взойти на престол, и не абы кому, а той, кто лишал дервишей прав и подвергал их гонению!\n\n— Он делал это по моему распоряжению, — голос Фахамки потушил пылающую ярость Фурашо, и она обернулась ко входу в туннель, откуда появилась Великая Просветительница. Похрамывая, старая гиена заняла место на лавке около стены и опёрлась на свою трость. — И в порыве гнева ты намеренно выискиваешь причины утаивания этой информации. Не утруждай себя, стой спокойно и слушай – это важно. Ты всё ещё смотришь на мир через призму правящего и подчинённого, но мы дервиши, а не правители. Мы учим и наставляем – не правим. Джавхарад такая же дочь Гиении, как и ты, и простой народ присягнул ей на верность и последовал за ней, также как и сотни солдат присоединились к нам из-за тебя.\n\n— Великая Просветительница, я отдала себя вам и посвятила свою жизнь вашему делу, а эта принцесска выросла в окружении несметных богатств, которые она якобы получила по праву рождения. И из-за этой "избранности" она считает, что имеет полное право царить над нами. Я отринула то, чему меня учили – она нет!\n\n— Никто не может винить ученика в том, что он не учится, когда у него нет учителя. Да и к тому же, — Фахамка улыбнулась, бросив быстрый взгляд на Масаску, — ей пришлось отринуть намного больше, чем ты можешь подумать.\n\n— Она отказалась от роскоши своих покоев и теперь кормит больных и раненых со своего стола. Также Джавхарад присоединилась к морской высадке, чтобы вселить в своих солдат надежду и мужество, — в отличие от надрывного тона Фурашо, Масаска звучал тихо и говорил полушёпотом. — По-моему скромному мнению, она достойна того, чтобы её выслушали, — Фахамка улыбнулась и дополнила слова Тени.\n\n— И мы встретимся с ней и обсудим будущее Гиении. Она может и не пойти по стопам своей матери. Также как не пошла по её стопам и ты.\n\nМедленно, с большой неохотой Фурашо сделала шаг назад и низко кивнула."

Если мы хотим встретиться с ней, то не должны идти в одиночку. Мы должны прихватить с собой не менее тысячи воинов. Пусть она возьмёт с собой столько же, если пожелает. Но, я искренне призываю не идти на встречу неподготовленными, как бы сильно мы не верили в единство.\n\n— Ты говоришь об этом исключительно из искреннего беспокойства? Или настойчиво пытаешься найти недостатки или опасность там, где их нет? — Многозначительно спросил Масаска и Фурашо наградила его свирепым взглядом в ответ.\n\n— Ты постоянно ставишь мои слова и действия под сомнение. Я нередко готова мириться с этим, но только не в этот раз. Я сердцем и кровью поклялась служить Кайлиду и все мои поступки творятся во благо нашего народа. Ты не имеешь права подвергать их сомнению!\n\n— Вы двое бранитесь как старая супружеская пара, — усмехнулась Фахамка. — Я надеюсь, что вы пригласите меня на торжество, когда она наберётся решимости внести тебя в ваш новый дом. — Услышав столь неожиданно замечание, Фурашо моргнула и отступила назад. Затем она с Масаской удивлённо уставились на Фахамку, словно не веря своим ушам. — Отлично, вы прекратили эту бесполезную перепалку. Я выслушала Фурашо. А каково твоё мнение, Масаска? Стоит ли нам идти на встречу без сопровождения?\n\n— Мы могли бы, да. Но в этом случае я никак не могу гарантировать безопасность. Если мы намереваемся взять с собой воинов, я бы остановился на сотне. Их будет достаточно, чтобы защитить нас в случае проблем, одновременно не вызывая страха и подозрений у другой стороны. — Фахамка медленно кивнула в ответ на его слова."

hyenia.14.d:0 "Встреча роялистов и дервишей была напряжённой. Аскетичная Фахамка и блистающая нарядом Джавхарад контрастировали друг с другом как день и ночь. Сообщения о появлении в округе йети ещё более обострили ситуацию, так что переговоры начались с затишья. Какая гиена должна сделать первый шаг? По древнему обычаю именно к Джавхарад как лицу королевской крови нужно обратиться первой. Но дервиши видели в Малахитовом троне лишь источник их притеснений и сражались с ним за право жить и существовать. Из-за этого противоречия никто не желал делать первый шаг, но вскоре Джавхарад нарушила воцарившееся безмолвие. В нарушение вековых обычаев она оставила свою охрану и двинулась по направлению к дервишам в одиночку, чем вызвала шок у обеих сторон. Когда принцесса пошла вперёд, Фахамка последовала её примеру. Старая гиена заковыляла к принцессе с тростью в одной лапе и свёрнутым ковриком под другой. Две гиены встретились в центре поля и Джавхарад, в очередной раз нарушив традиции и обычаи, поклонилась Фахамке.\n\n— Приветствую вас, Великая Просветительница Фахамка. Для меня большая честь наконец-то лично встретиться с вами. Я признаю, что нахожусь в великом долгу перед вами за всё, что вы сделали для нашего народа. Я пришла к вам сегодня в надежде на то, что мы сможем прийти к согласию во имя светлого будущего нашей родины.\n\n— Приветствую вас, принцесса Джавхарад. — Фахамка аналогично склонила голову. — Ваши слова добры. Это куда больше, чем я ожидала от дочери королевы Дахаб. — Она расстелила коврик на земле и села с краю, оставив достаточно места для принцессы. — А теперь, пожалуйста, присаживайтесь и расскажите мне, каким вы представляете будущее нашей родины. — Джавхарад послушалась пожилой гиены и села рядом.\n\n— Когда я двигалась с войском по Гиении, то видела как обычные гиены приветствовали меня со слезами радости на глазах. Я – их потерянное прошлое и обещание мира, но именно вы освободили нас. Вот почему я пришла просить вашего благословения на собственную коронацию. Также я хочу, чтобы ваше учение наставляло нас в ходе восстановления Гиении.\n\n— О? Значит, никаких долгих месяцев борьбы за крохи власти, попыток найти баланс между обещаниями и угрозами ради получения преимущества? — Мягко спросила Фахамка. Джавхарад улыбнулась в ответ.\n\n— С вашим благословением у меня будет родина, которую нужно отстроить. И у меня не будет времени на интриги."

hyenia.15.d:0 "Будущее всегда преподносит новые вызовы, невзирая на прошлые заслуги. Одна из наиболее коварных форм самодовольства – использование предыдущей хорошей работы для оправдания нынешней лени. Делегация достигла места встречи с монархистами и порочность былого мышления быстро стала очевидной, когда один из дервишей упал замертво, сражённый пулей. Хотя поначалу дервиши опасались измены, их истинный враг явил себя, когда из укромных мест вокруг гиен появились вооружённые йети.\n\nОбе стороны, прибывшие сюда в надежде на мирные переговоры, взяли с собой лишь лёгкое оружие, и были вынуждены бежать в укрытие. То ли йети были отчаянно храбры, то ли ненавидели гиен до безумия, что затмило им разум, но они получили один-единственный шанс отомстить за своё поражение – и без колебаний воспользовались им, пусть это и было самоубийственной миссией. Существа шторма – немые элитные воины йети – обрушились на гиен, полные желания разорвать наглых псов на части. Но, как многие уже успели узнать, дервиши относились к ближнему бою не менее серьёзно, чем к любому другому аспекту сражения. Громкий звон, похожий на колокольный, наполнил воздух, когда ревущая Фурашо своими тяжёлыми стальными перчатками смяла морду одного из существ шторма, возглавив контрнаступление дервишей.\n\nОднако роялисты не могли похвастать подобным воинским мастерством. Их ряды состояли в основном из беженцев и выживших во время вторжения солдат. Они никогда не учились у Великой Просветительницы и не могли столь успешно сражаться в ближнем бою. Засада вылилась в бойню, и хотя принцесса попыталась бежать, её быстро загнали в угол существа шторма, на милосердие которых точно не стоило полагаться."

После окончания боя и Фахамка, и принцесса остались в живых, хотя последнюю окружали тела её слуг. Джавхарад была парализована ужасом, а Масаска невозмутимо счищал кровь со своего меча прямо у неё на глазах. Перед принцессой лежало обезглавленное существо бури, которое только что собиралось прикончить Джавхарад. И убитый йети был совсем не одинок – повсюду можно было лицезреть ужасную картину кровавой бойни.\n\n— Бедделаад? — Позвала Джавхарад, потрясённо оглядываясь вокруг: Масаска подошёл к ней и осторожно снял свой плащ. Он знал, кого принцесса имеет в виду – старого советника, которого он приметил во время предыдущих визитов. Старый верный слуга, который был ей как отец. А теперь умер, как и вся остальная свита. Ей не нужно было видеть это. — Г-где Бедделаад?!\n\n— Всё в порядке, — прошептал Масаска, накидывая плащ на плечи Джавхарад и поднимая капюшон. Так она не увидит труп советника, которого только что звала. — Ты в безопасности. Ты знаешь меня, — сказал он ей тихо. — Маленькая Тень? — Его глаза слегка сощурились, когда Масаска попытался улыбнуться под вуалью. Это был первый раз, когда они могли встретиться лицом к лицу... И всё же Джавхарад, похоже, узнала его: глаза принцессы сфокусировались на нём и она что-то пробормотала. — Ты в безопасности, никто не обидит тебя. Мы поклялись защищать Гиению, так что будем защищать и тебя.\n\nПринцесса Джавхарад была совсем щенком, когда пала её родина. Она была вынуждена повзрослеть слишком быстро, чтобы стать, как она заявляла, достойным своего народа лидером... Но Масаска видел лишь сломленную душу, потерявшую своих близких. И, последовав примеру Фахамки, которая нашла его в руинах родного дома все эти годы назад, он мягко призвал принцессу встать. Масаска обвёл взглядом собравшихся дервишей и решительно заговорил. — Клянусь, что мы защитим тебя и всю Гиению. Вы все в безопасности, мы позаботимся об этом.\n\nФахамке, молча наблюдавшей за этой сценой, оставалось только грустно улыбнуться. Маленький Масаска...

Оценив ситуацию, дервиши медленно прошли средь тел убитых роялистов и собрались у павшей принцессы. Масаска стоял на коленях рядом с ней. Он опустил голову и осторожно закрыл сперва один её глаз, а затем другой. Гиена не мог подобрать слов, да и остальные дервиши были безмолвны. Все они понимали, что встреча с роялистами может пройти неудачно, но такого они уж точно не ожидали.\n\n— Бедные, несчастные щенки. — Прошептала Фахамка, медленно шествуя средь павших гиен. — Наконец-то увидеть свою потерянную родину после стольких лет изгнания и тут же умереть...\n\n— Дело роялистов мертво, — откровенно сказала Фурашо, сложив передние лапы и глядя на мёртвую принцессу. — Жребий брошен и отныне только одна сила может объединить Гиению. Прошу простить меня за дерзость, Великая Просветительница, но если мы не хотим, чтобы всё, над чем мы работали, пошло прахом, то должны воспользоваться этим моментом. Роялистов больше нельзя считать надёжным союзником: они вскоре ополчатся против нас, заявив, что это был наш коварный план. У нас есть лишь один шанс нанести удар и убедиться, что они не будут вносить разлад. Гиении не суждено получить новую королеву. У нашей страны есть только мы, дервиши. И я предам ваше учение, если мы не воспользуемся этим шансом. Есть ли у меня ваше благословение на то, чтобы стать лидером, в котором так нуждается Гиения?\n\nФахамка посмотрела на Фурашо. Такая гордая. Такая сильная. Рождённая в мире, где сила превыше всего, и имеющая шрамы, подтверждающие это. Отличный дервиш, но до чего же она всё ещё несовершенна! А может, Фурашо уже была готова.

Она тяжело дышала, а её лапы горели от усталости. Вокруг себя гиена видела лишь смерть. Пороховой дым окутал мир, превратив его в какой-то странный сон, и Фурашо, спотыкаясь, начала карабкаться вверх по склону, пытаясь найти остальных. Время от времени она останавливалась и звала своих товарищей по оружию, но ответом ей была лишь тишина. Когда Фурашо наконец нашла ту, кого искала, сон превратился в кошмар.\n\nТела йети усеивали землю вокруг Фахамки, одна лапа которой всё ещё сжимала окровавленный меч. На теле гиены виднелись многочисленные раны, а одна её нога была и вовсе оторвана. Фурашо потребовалось несколько секунд, чтобы осознать ужасную правду. Великая Просветительница, спасительница Гиении и та, кто дала Фурашо смысл жизни после того, как сгорел её дом, был мертва.\n\nФурашо могла только безмолвно смотреть на кошмарное зрелище, развернувшееся перед ней. Как будто что-то давило на неё, не давая пошевелиться. По крайней мере, до тех пор, пока она не услышала шум позади себя. Повернувшись к потенциальной угрозе и угрожающе подняв латные перчатки, Фурашо увидела как к ней спотыкаясь идёт Масаска, зажимая тяжёлую рану на животе.\n\n— Где она? — Масаска еле слышно шептал, едва удерживаясь в вертикальном положении. Она не понимала, как ему вообще удавалось стоять на ногах. У Фурашо не было сил на слова, она лишь взглянула на тело Фахамки, а Масаска проследил за её взглядом. При виде этого ужасного зрелища у него окончательно подкосились ноги и Масаска рухнул на землю. — Нет... нет! — Спокойствие, которым так славился он в прошлом, исчезло без следа, и он пополз к телу, поскуливая подобно щенку. Кровавый след тянулся за Масаской, и когда гиена добрался до Фахамки, то вцепился одной лапой в её мантию и затих.\n\n— Масаска?! — Фурашо схватила своего былого соперника и потянула к себе, пытаясь привести его в чувство, но было уже поздно. Медленно отпустив его, Фурашо огляделась вокруг. Шок постепенно проходил, и когда она осознала весь ужас произошедшего, то по долине разнёсся её истерический смех."

За последние годы это внушительное строение перенесло много страданий, но, несмотря на это, оно по-прежнему оставалось незыблемым символом могущества старой династии.\n\nСкрывая свои эмоции за маской стоицизма, в центре длинного шествия шла Фурашо. Она двигалась к ступенькам древнего замка, у входа в который ожидала Фахамка. Великая Просветительница не хотела принимать участие в сей церемонии, но Фурашо настаивала на необходимости её присутствия: старая гиена представляла собой Великую Просветительницу, Голос Кайлида и Первого дервиша – фигуру, у которой учились все члены религиозного братства. Теперь, когда у Гиении остались только дервиши, им нужно было чётко обозначить, кто здесь главный.\n\nКогда процессия поднялась по ступеням, Фурашо вышла из окружения монахов и низко поклонилась Фахамке.

Впервые оказавшись на пороге у Кайлида, ты была сломленной и опозоренной, — заявила Фахамка, знавшая, как правильно поставить голос так, чтобы его было слышно громко и чётко, — Но ты сумела побороть тьму внутри себя и успешно повела дервишей в бой, вернув наши родные земли. Ты – Кулак Кайлида, и тебе пора стать чем-то большим. Возьмёшь ли ты на себя бремя правления не только над дервишами, но и над всеми гиенами? Готова ли ты стать Верховным дервишем и повести страну к светлому будущему?\n\n— Я слышу зов моего народа, и я здесь ради него, — ответила Фурашо и подняла лапы, всё ещё преклоняясь перед Фахамкой.

Рядовые для них не были опасны: это простые гиены, бывшие беженцы, получившие шанс вернуться домой с оружием в лапах. Но вот офицеры – совсем другое дело, они – остатки былой аристократии Гиении, которая даже сегодня сохраняет немалое влияние. Смерть принцессы приведёт к росту враждебности с их стороны и – в лучшем случае – к раздроблению армии, в результате чего по Гиении будут бродить десятки вооружённых банд. Дервишам такой хаос точно не нужен, так что с этим вопросом нужно было разобраться до того как он начнёт доставляться настоящие проблемы.\n\nФурашо приказала Масаске позаботиться о том, чтобы убрать лидеров роялистов со сцены, и Клинок Кайлида неохотно подчинился. Желание избежать дальнейшего кровопролития не умаляло его стыда за то, что они фактически скормили роялистам дезинформацию, вынуждающую их напасть на дервишей и тем самым дать повод разделаться с ними. Это пятно на их совести, но всё же роялисты достаточно многочисленны, чтобы представлять реальную угрозу стабильности, если с ними не решить вопрос.\n\nКогда офицеры роялистов будут мертвы, их тела увезут и похоронят в землях предков. Солдат, по возможности, разоружат, а лишённая лидеров армия будет (скорее всего) распущена без особых проблем. Всё будет сделано как можно аккуратнее, однако это никак не искупит поступка дервишей: они использовали роялистов, заставили молодую принцессу думать, что они на её стороне, не смогли уберечь Джавхарад, а затем расправились с её союзниками."

Однако она также видела, к чему привели излишества королевы Дахаб и как они поспособствовали ослаблению Гиении изнутри. Подхалимы и лизоблюды – плохой фундамент для возведения на нём государства, поэтому новому лидеру нужны были не только верные ей гиены, но и те, кто был бы готов твёрдо стоять на страже праведности и справедливости.\n\nНазначение Богсийе и Эбера Вейна в свой ближний круг было само собой разумеющимся: они хорошо служили ей на протяжении многих лет. Эбер Вейн мастерски превращал молодых гиен в способных бойцов и дервишей, а Богсийе была мудра и опытна в вопросах здоровья, лечения и питания. Учитывая текущее положение народа, последнее было особенно необходимо. Синьяле могла бы сослужить ей не меньшую службу, даже если великие литейные Гиении будут совсем не похожи на те мастерские, которые она организовывала во время сопротивления.\n\nНо когда речь заходила о делах науки, Фурашо признавалась, что лучшей кандидатуры, чем Келиди, ей попросту не найти, хотя он был открытым сторонником Масаски. Кстати, раз уж речь зашла о нём... Что делать с её соперником? Маленькая часть Фурашо, чьи стыдливые мысли она уже давно научилась отгонять от себя, хотела задвинуть его на второй план. Но где найти достойного шпиона, что мог хотя бы сравниться с ним? Кто сможет провести отряд в тыл врага и нанести удар там, где он нанесёт наибольший ущерб? Глупо считать, что Масаска недостоин своей должности или что он не сможет хорошо послужить Гиении.\n\nДа, именно Гиении, не ей. Фурашо была всего лишь первой слугой народа, и если она забудет об этом, то очень быстро может стать ещё одной Дахаб."

Фурашо знала это. Даже Великая Просветительница была обязана подчиняться правилам природы.\n\nВ сиянии свечей и фонарей писцы-добровольцы излагали догматы Кайлида как можно более кратким и чётким образом. Посланники, сопровождаемые многими наиболее опытными посвящёнными Великой Просветительницы, посещали города и деревни, стремясь разъяснить принципы их новой правительницы. Аколиты присутствовали на всех встречах Фурашо с теми, кого можно было бы назвать двором, а то и правительством. Новым освобождённым уже не нужно было сражаться, ибо пришло время для разработки законов, необходимых для создания государства...

Цифры не лгали, и несмотря на всю словесную мишуру, призванную скрыть их истинный смысл, из них можно было сделать вывод: Гиения не просто ранена, а почти что искалечена.\n\nЛитейные и фабрики, служившие основой промышленной мощи Гиении, ныне в большинстве своём бездействовали или и вовсе были разрушены. Сеть подземных туннелей, пролегавшая под большей частью региона, во многих местах обрушилась и распалась на отдельные крошечные ходы. Фермы страны находились в полном хаосе, никто из их владельцев не может даже просто ответить, сколько вообще продовольствия выращивается. Так что для многих гиен голод уже стал неотъемлемой частью жизни. Сотни тысяч так или иначе бежали из Гиении, прихватив с собой свои богатства и все продукты, которые они только могли унести, чтобы попытаться построить жизнь заново в другом месте.\n\n— ...и поэтому на вопрос о том, что нужно сделать, мы, судя по всему, можем ответить 'да', — сухо пошутила дервиш, из-за чего Фурашо бросила на неё испепеляющий взгляд. — Простите меня за юмор, но вот к чему я веду. Гиения страдает от множества бед, так что неважно с чего мы начнём: всё равно найдутся те, кто продолжат страдать из-за того, что мы отдали предпочтение другой сфере.\n\n— Да, возможно. Но пока мы сидим тут в безопасности и с полными животами, остальная часть страны страдает. Я предлагаю проявить милосердие и не язвить, пока другие голодают. — Данная колкость была вполне невинной, но Фурашо припоминала слишком уж много моментов, когда при дворе царил смех над тяжёлым положением простых гиен.

Но когда один йети пал ниц перед советом дервишей, покорно склонив голову, мало кто захотел припоминать ему прошлые грехи всего вида.\n\n— Благородные воины-дервиши. Я молю вас не ради себя, но ради своей семьи. Когда я переселился в эти земли, то хотел лишь пахать землю и выращивать урожай. Я никогда не питал зла ни к кому из вас и гордился тем, что давал вашим собратьям-гиенам работу при первой возможности.

Он был не одинок: тысячи подобных ему ныне жили теперь на землях гиен, куда они перебрались сразу после вторжения.\n\n— Я... если это послужит достойной компенсацией, то я предлагаю самого себя в качестве раба, чтобы вернуть наш долг вашему народу. Всё, о чём я прошу – это не изгонять мою семью из единственного дома, который они когда-либо знали.\n\n— Ты просишь о милосердии и в то же время оскорбляешь нас, утверждая, будто мы держим рабов. Нет, тебе лучше молчать и не усугублять ситуацию. — Фурашо подняла лапу. — Если бы мы оказали тебе милость в стиле йети, то ты бы сейчас бежал со всех ног обратно в земли своих предков, преследуемый воинами, охотящимися на тебя просто ради развлечения. Однако наш совет не уподобится Королю Шторму, запомни это. — Она вспомнила долгие беседы касательного этого вопроса, подавила приступ ярости и провозгласила своё решение."

hyenia_furasho.9.d:0 "Воспоминания Фурашо о детстве были... не самыми простыми. И в одном из самых ранних её мать демонстрировала молодой Фурашо, что роль обычной гиены не из рядов знати заключается в том, чтобы вести себя пассивно и послушно. Во главе Гиении стояла аристократия, так что думать должна голова, но никак не лапа. Чтобы доказать свои слова, мать приказывала простым гиенам унижаться перед ней. Обыватели, напуганные потенциальной карой за неподчинение, безропотно подчинялись приказам знати. Мать Фурашо утверждала, что повиновение – это намордник для их разума, а доброта позволит черни думать, будто они имеют право обходиться без поводка.\n\nПосле многих столетий столь жестокого обращения, ущерб, нанесённый самому пониманию мира обычными гиенами, был неизмеримо огромен, и поэтому нельзя останавливаться на полумерах в их перевоспитании. Сперва они будут кротко повиноваться, но со временем Кайлид откроет их разум истинному пониманию, как это случилось с самой Фурашо. Гиена знала, что критика неизбежна, но как та, кто когда-то была частью этой мерзкой тирании, Фурашо прекрасно понимала, что произойдёт, когда поводок ослабнет. Когда абсолютный порядок, некогда управлявший всей Гиенией, сдаст позиции, Кайлид должен быть рядом, чтобы поддержать гиен в трудный час, как это было с ней. В противном случае наступит полный хаос.\n\nЧтобы всё прошло как по маслу, изучение Кайлида станет обязательным для всех гиен. Избранные дервиши будут следить за тем, чтобы знания распространялись по всей Гиении и чтобы новички-послушники успешно постигали основы учения. Тех, кто добьётся успеха на этот поприще, возведут в ранг полноценных дервишей. Они будут равны по оказываемому почёту и обязанностям тем, кто сражался в войне за освобождение родины. Однако стоит отметить, что ранг послушника нельзя отнять ни при каких обстоятельствах даже у самой бесталанной гиены. Кайлид, а вместе с ним и надежда, всегда будут рядом с ними.

Оно всё ещё было скромным и наскоро сделанным, но благодаря её предусмотрительности в тот час, когда под землю хлынули беженцы, пещеры смогли дать приют многим тысячам из них. Для тех гиен, которые бежали от завоевателей несколько дней, а то и недель подряд, вид этих мрачных туннелей, наконец-то давших им безопасный приют, был подобен раю. Это было простое и аскетичное место, но тут им предоставляли еду, постели и лекарства. И хотя ресурсы дервишей были очень ограничены, а резервы напряжены до предела, массовый голод всё же удалось предотвратить, так что они выжили и стали лишь сильнее.\n\nЧиидачируд был первым городом дервишей, но из-за войны он так и остался просто изрядно расширенной лапами и кирками пещерой под пустыней. Изначальные жители этого места хорошо перенесли испытания, многие из них позже и сами присоединились к дервишам. Но центр власти переместился в Кальби Вейн, так что же будет с этим местом, где возродилась Гиения? Фурашо не позволила забросить Чиидачируд и превратить его в пустую оболочку того, чем он был раньше. Залы расширялись, строились новые здания и вскоре тут можно было найти полноценный город. Сердце его осталось неизменным и будет таковым и в будущем, но остальная часть города значительно улучшилась и обновилась, так что жители Чиидачируда смогут наслаждаться плодами роста государства.\n\nИ всё же те новички-послушники, что будут идти на север под солнцем и звёздами, найдут хорошо спрятанные ходы, спустятся в ожидающие их туннели и получат там простую пищу, кров и воду, что для усталого странника будет восприниматься как роскошный пир.

Выбравшись из кузова, они сперва обратили внимание на название исправительного учреждения, написанное жирными буквами, а потом поняли, что их водителем была сама Фурашо в своих печально известных смертоносных перчатках.\n\nОна стукнула одним стальным кулаком по стене тюрьмы, а вторым – по другому грузовику, из которого другие йети уже доставали униформу и инвентарь для уборки. — Извините за слегка... пугающую встречу, но это единственное место, где есть парковка, которая подходит вам по размерам, и где можно быстро раздать все нужные вещи.\n\nФурашо быстро осмотрела "пленников". — Я понимаю, что ваш мир перевернулся с ног на голову, — сказала она. — Мой же просто раскололся на части. Тогда мне казалось, что это конец истории... Ничто не осталось прежним. Но я училась, приспосабливалась, становилась сильнее и лучше себя прежней. Я не могла позволить себе горевать бесконечно. — Она бросила швабру одному йети. И когда тот энергично, как и подобает солдату в расцвете своих сил, поймал её, Фурашо преисполнилась гордости. — Вот это настрой! Король Шторм хорошо вас обучил, только вот... не слишком конструктивным вещам."

Когда-то здесь проходили торговые пути и эту местность караваны выбирали для краткой остановки на отдых. Дидибка выросла в полноценный молодой город, оазис для путешественников посреди, на первый взгляд, безжизненной пустоши. А затем йети превратили её в руины. Многие погибли благородной смертью. Даже отступая и сражаясь друг с другом.\n\nВ конце концов, гражданская война, как правило, избавляет от необходимости нести ответственность и отчитываться.\n\nСписок данных заблудших бандитов (Фурашо никак не могла назвать "солдатами" этих лакеев Короля Шторма) был весьма длинным.

А потом ещё совершенно неожиданно объявись гиены и сумели захватить власть в их землях. И эти новые завоеватели оказались совершенно чокнутыми – почти как существа шторма – раз они сумели вдребезги разбить силы военачальников-йети.\n\nНо под властью гиен йети ждало отнюдь не порабощение или рабство... Корош не знал, что и думать об этом. Как будто новые владыки не видели разницы между йети и гиенами, а просто хотели обратить их всех в свою диковинную философию. Для Короша почти все догматы гиен были превыше его понимания, но для гиен же это всё работало каким-то образом.\n\nОн не понимал, для него это всё было странным, но ещё больше Корош устал. Спустя два десятилетия сражений он давно оставил позади мысли о чести и славе. Ныне йети утомился стойко выносить жизненные невзгоды и просто желал покоя."

Позади дервиша стояли его ученики, настороженно поглядывая на громадного воина, который уселся на краю поля и наблюдал за ними. Никто из них не решался подойти, пока учитель, спросив, действительно ли они верят, что гость будет сидеть и наблюдать, прежде чем напасть на них, не подошёл к нему со словами приветствия. В ответ существо шторма покачало головой, указало на старика и подняло руку со слегка раздвинутыми большим и указательным пальцами. Дервиш хихикнул, явно поняв его, и уселся рядом с существом шторма.\n\n— Идите заниматься дальше, щенки. Лучше уделите внимание упражнениям, а не подслушиванию. Давайте, вперёд. — Он отослал младших гиен прочь и вновь обратил внимание на существо шторма. — Я так понимаю, ты здесь не для того, чтобы присмотреться к моим ученикам, прежде чем съесть их? Как жаль разрушать их иллюзии. — Существо шторма покачало головой. — Что ж, ясно. Тебя интересуют дервиши? — Кивок подтвердил правильность догадки. — Интересно. У вас, существ шторма, есть свои учения, я это знаю. И ваше наследие действительно впечатляет. Возможно, мы могли бы научить друг друга чему-то новому? — Существо шторма быстро замотало головой. — Я не прошу раскрывать никакие тайны или священные секреты. Только те немногие знания, которыми ты можешь поделиться, не нарушая учений твоего ордена. Покажи всё, что не причинит вреда твоему народу, а я в свою очередь с радостью поделюсь с тобой всем, чем только смогу.

По мнению Фурашо, Кайлид был двуликим: одной лапой он провозглашал мир и перемены, а другой поддерживал давние традиции насилия.\n\nПоэтому, когда несколько известных деятелей Звахиле решили официально высказать свои претензии, обсуждать их пришлось отнюдь не на подиуме или за столом переговоров. Вместо этого Фурашо поманила зебр в сторону пустого джипа. — Следуйте за мной, — фактически потребовала она вместо приветствия.\n\nМашина ехала по захваченным землям родины зебр и остановилась в небольшой деревушке, где в воздухе витал аромат знакомых специй, суливший изобилие овощей на прилавках и столах. Вскоре стали слышны и звуки местной жизни, среди которых особенно выделялись проповеди на заднем плане. Они оказались не столько кайлидскими песнопениями, сколько духовными наставлениями касательно размышлений, медитаций, а также подготовки ума и сердца к предстоящему пути. Затем слова воплотились в действия: на бессистемно оборудованных рабочих местах множество машин и механизмов безмолвно задавали вопрос: "Как можно улучшить нас?" Оба вида начали обучать друг друга премудростям деревообработки, кузнечного дела и боевых искусств (несмотря на различия в строении конечностей)...\n\nФурашо посетила столько деревень, сколько могло уместиться в расписании её гостей. И на каждой остановке зебрам Звахиле разрешалось бродить по окрестностям и общаться с местными жителями. Экскурсия завершилась, когда солнце село где-то за журчащей рекой неподалёку от очередной деревушки.\n\nСидящая под одиноким деревом Фурашо посчитала, что гиены и зебры поняли друг друга."

Так что у Фурашо возникла идея. Она обсудила её с другими дервишами и самой Фахамкой, и в итоге она выкристаллизовалась в нечто совершенно новое: Заповедь Купели Дождя.\n\nИ Гиения, и земли йети за последние годы очень сильно пострадали. Но из этой трагедии могут прорасти семена чего-то нового, что оставит старую боль и страдания позади и предложит начать всё с чистого листа. Это не отменит миллионы обид и не повернёт вспять реки ненависти и негодования, которые разделяли гиен и йети, но это будет началом строительства чего-то нового. Эти два общества, объединённые Кайлидом и ведомые дервишами, смогут построить нечто такое, что выйдет за рамки истории и сможет связать воедино два разделённых вида.\n\nЗаповедь Купели Дождя станет первым шагом, мыслью, что будет направлять дервишей – будь то гиен или йети – в преобразовании их уголка Зебрики в нечто, способное оставить обиды прошлого позади."

Ндарака открыто пригласил Илаали разделить с ним стол и пищу, даже не помышляя заискивать или подлизываться к гиене-чиновнице. Для неё был приготовлен стул, как раз подходящий по размеру для представителей её вида.\n\nА ещё за столом сидел йети, который также мог похвастать комфортным стулом. Его звали Савохком.

Вместо этого темы перетекали одна в другую: Ндарака мечтал открыть по всей стране ряд трактиров, чтобы помогать путникам-пилигримам, Савохк же был очарован обязанностью кормить тех, кто в этом больше всего нуждается...\n\nА Илаали говорила обо всём, что видела и слышала. Её списки, записи, все те необходимые подсчёты для создания новой нации с опорой на три вида. Ранее днём она говорила об этом так много, что Ндарака внезапно вмешался в её увлечённый монолог. — Кажется, что вы завалены работой по уши, мисс. Почему бы вам не отужинать с нами сегодня вечером?\n\nОдними кастрюлями и сковородками войну не выиграть. Недоброжелатели за границей всё ещё могут попытаться лишить дервишей независимости.

У гиены были списки, данные переписей и заветы Кайлида в письменном виде, но почти не было тех, кому он мог бы проповедовать.

hyenia_princess.6.d:0 "— Я уже стара и точно не молодею, — Фахамка держала чашку кофе со специями в обеих лапах, обращаясь к группе сидящих перед ней гиен. Это было похоже на очередное из её бесчисленных занятий, но присутствие Джавхарад, её советника Бедделаада, Фурашо, Масаски, Келиди, Эбера Вейна, Ксаавы и многих других говорило об обратном. — Конфликт подтолкнул дервишей к принятию будущего, когда они ещё не были полностью готовы к этим переменам, а я стала тем солнцем, вокруг которого начало вращаться всё сущее. Прямо как твоя мать, — она обратилась к Джавхарад, которая виновато склонила голову. Её мать Дахаб была автократом, что требовала абсолютного контроля над Гиенией и тем самым обрекла страну на гибель, ведь без её согласия нельзя было принять ни одно решение. — Если я буду продолжать в том же духе и сохраню абсолютный контроль, то после смерти оставлю вакуум власти, в результате чего дервиши попросту разорвут себя на части. Однако сейчас... поскольку правительство молодое и слабое, то и таким будет и лидерство дервишей. — При этих словах собравшиеся гиены заволновались.\n\n— Ты прекрасная молодая гиена, Джавхарад, и можешь стать хорошей королевой. Но по мере того, как ты будешь вживаться в роль, рядом с тобой будут Фурашо и Масаска. Вместе вы сможете построить новую Гиению. Но делать выбор и будущее определять будущее будешь именно ты, Джавхарад. А чтобы никто не говорил, что мы полностью игнорируем древние традиции... — Фахамка встала, подошла к Джавхарад и протянула ей лапы. После секундного колебания принцесса позволила старой гиене взять её лапы в свои. — Знай, Джавхарад, дочь Дахаб, что ты достойна. Знай, что я вижу в тебе эту добродетель и благословляю как лидера Гиении. Моей единственной просьбой будет лишь обязательство прислушиваться к словам своего народа и помнить, благодаря кому ты взошла на этот трон.\n\nИ опять эта бесцеремонная прямота. Джавхарад улыбнулась, всё ещё не придя в себя от столь внезапной новости. Но она произнесла следующие слова, не колеблясь ни секунды." #Fahamka steps down as leader of the armed forces and declaring who will lead the dervishes from now on, as well as formally giving her blessing to Jawharad as the rightful ruler of Hyenia."

hyenia_princess.7.t:0 "В подземье" 
hyenia_princess.7.d:0 "Старая система пещер под Гиенией была полностью разрушена во время нападения Короля Шторма. Гиены спасались бегством и разрушали за собой свои же туннели, надеясь выиграть время. Помимо этого и сами йети со злорадным удовольствием находили и подрывали туннели при первой же возможности, чтобы выгнать своих противников из-под земли. В итоге некогда огромная сеть распалась на отдельные куски, так что её восстановление будет грандиозным проектом.\n\nНо сколько десятков тысяч гиен всё ещё томились там, во тьме, затаившись в непроглядных глубинах в страхе перед ужасами, что терзают Гиению? Многие из них по-прежнему живы, ибо существование под землёй не чуждо гиенам. Однако все эти тысячи недостижимы и потеряны для государства. И чтобы найти их, гиены должны сделать то, что они умеют лучше всего – рыть земные недра.\n\nЭтим шахтёрам, которых сама Джавхарад на торжественной церемонии нарекла "Землеройным корпусом гиен", было поручено вернуть свой утраченный подземный дом. Ведь, как известно всем, "солнце может осыпать нас миллионами поцелуев, но из земли мы пришли и в неё же уйдём". Обычно эта пословица должна настраивать на неизбежность смерти. Но в наших древнейших историях говорится о том, что мы пробились из глубин земли на поверхность, так что поговорка указывает и на нашу неразрывную связь с подземным миром."

Профессору следовало бы обидеться на то, что она попросту схватила его, перекинула через себя и вынесла из академии. Впрочем, если бы не её поступок, то его бы не было здесь. Хотя глаза Акуна стали видеть хуже, а спина сгорбилась, он по-прежнему мог разглядеть перед собой великие столпы Кальби Вейн. Город был разрушен, и старик не мог удержаться от слёз, когда увидел, сколько старых зданий, доставшихся в наследство от предков, было уничтожено. И всё же он снова был дома. Академия вновь открылась, и скоро Акун опять сможет преподавать и заниматься исследованиями под покровительством Малахитового трона.\n\n— Позвольте мне нести ваш груз, почтенный старейшина. — Предложил кто-то и Акун инстинктивно протянул свой саквояж тому, кого он принял за Ксогайе. Его слух тоже был не таким острым как прежде. Но потом он понял, что его помощница стоит чуть дальше, и потрясенно посмотрел на говорившего. Перед собой он видел не привычную ассистентку, а чёрную одежду воина и морду, которую пересекал неприятный шрам. Да это же один из ужасных пустынных бандитов!\n\n— Помогите! Разбойники! Ксогайе, меня грабят! — Движимый испугом профессор поднял свою трость и начал яростно лупить негодяя по голове. Пусть ему почти девяносто зим, но он не намеревался сдаваться без боя!\n\n— Нет! Профессор! Профессор, это наш эскорт! Прекратите его бить! — Ксогайе вскрикнула, подбежала к нему и выхватила трость, остановив Акуна. Профессор моргнул, глядя между своей помощницей и тем, кого он принял за бандита. Закутанный в чёрную ткань воин в данный момент прикрывал голову лапами.\n\n— О... м-м-м... да, пожалуйста?"

tech_hye_start:0 "Sustenance and Survival"
tech_hye_start_desc:0 "Our people has always held up endurance as a virtue. In the high mountains and dry deserts you fight against the elements as much as your enemies, and wastefulness will all too easily be your undoing. Living off the land, learning to thrive despite the elements and to make sure your resources last is as much part of warfare as shooting or marching is." 
tech_hye_scavenge:0 "Scavenger Traditions"
tech_hye_scavenge_desc:0 "A gun is a gun, no matter where it came from, and every weapon seized from the enemy is one less that they can make use of as well as one more on our side. We understand this fact, and instead of wastefully throwing away potential tools, we make sure to scour far and wide for any potential equipment."
tech_hye_reinforcement:0 "Repeated Offensives"
tech_hye_reinforcement_desc:0 "Blind attacks cost lives, planned attacks cost time. Being able to reorganize and prepare for another attack faster than our enemy can recover will allow us to keep delivering blow after blow, never relenting and never giving them the opportunity to truly dig in. "
tech_hye_repair:0 "Pre-planned Rebuilding"
tech_hye_repair_desc:0 "We're no strangers to war and destruction, enough that we know that it is not the end if our enemy seizes important assets, not as long as we can reclaim them and restore them quickly. If we reclaim what is ours, the faster we can put it back into working condition, the better."
tech_hye_exp:0 "Scout Teachers" 
tech_hye_exp_desc:0 "To fight your enemy, you must know your enemy, and those among us who lead the way and guide our forces know more than most. As new warpups join the fight, they can learn from our scouts and be better equipped for the fight that awaits."
tech_hye_scavenge2:0 "Waste not, want not"
tech_hye_scavenge2_desc:0 "Modern war is about production and industry as much as it is about courage and training, and if our enemy offers such a bounty of equipment, supplies and weaponry to use, then why should we not help ourselves?"


tech_dervishes:0 "Dervish Division"
tech_dervishes_desc:0 "To be a dervish is to cast aside vice and distractions and to focus yourself utterly towards ceaseless self-improvement. War is no exception to this, and the dervishes carry out their campaigns through relentless movement around and constant harrying of their foes."
tech_dervishes2:0 "Dervish Division II"
tech_dervishes2_desc:0 "When the dervish way of fighting was developed, it became a synergy of traditional hyenian methods, lessons learned from the desert tribes in the region as well as various more esoteric or mystic traditions. As Fahamka mandated, these traditions are ever evolving, and the greatest sin a dervish fighter can commit is to think that their art is complete."
tech_dervishes3:0 "Dervish Division III"
tech_dervishes3_desc:0 "As part of the constant drive for self-improvement, the dervishes take training and learning both very seriously. In a group of dervishes, each member is expected to listen to their comrades and accept their advice on how they could improve."

tech_dervishes_b_desc:0 "War changes, and the dervishes change with it. The proliferation of rapid fire weapons mean that cover and camouflage are more important than ever, and the dervishes nigh magical ability to slip closer to and around their enemies has become even more prized than before."

tech_hyena_misc3_desc:0 "Improved architecture and design are making it more feasible to expand our underground cities, while ensuring they are not in danger from collapses. Our foes will find it particularly difficult to disrupt our industrial output, with almost all factories located safely in the deeper reaches."
tech_hyena_misc_a:0 "Heavy Machinery In Mining"
tech_hyena_misc_a_desc:0 "It is not enough to rely on strength to excavate ore - heavy machinery must be imported, built and utilised to expand our mining operations, while the unrefined ore is processed and turned into a useful material much quicker than before."
tech_hyena_misc_b:0 "Industrial Growth"

tech_hyena_army_atk3:0 "Offensive Tunneling"
tech_hyena_army_atk3_desc:0 "Few species read the ground as well as the dogs. Trained sappers will bypass enemy fortifications with multiple tunnels from which our forces can attack, trapping the defenders from both sides."
tech_hyena_army_def3:0 "Defensive Tunneling"
tech_hyena_army_def3_desc:0 "There is no firmer trench than one located underground. Our foes' numbers and airplanes will matter little once they are forced to attack us in our underground fortifications."

tech_hyena_army4_desc:0 "The sheer amount of resources dogs possess makes it particularly easy for them to establish defences wherever they are needed, in a short amount of time."

storm.4.t:0 "The Rise Of The Storm King"
storm.4.d:0 "Yeti have inhabited the island of Stormland for thousands of years, though records of ancestors only go back a thousand or so. From Stormland, the yeti crossed the narrow strait onto the mainland of Zebrica, conquering and settling new lands. However, yeti were disunited as a species: warlords fought each other while the storm creatures largely kept to themselves in the mountains. Several times, one yeti would come close to dominating all others, like Azarkar Stormbringer or Onur Iceshatter, only for their realms to fall apart after their deaths. This seemed to be a feature of yeti culture as no stable succession system was ever established, because strength and influence rather than inheritance defined rulership.\n\nLess than a century ago, the constant disunity following Azarkar's death in battle against the Imperial Mazwi led to the Uzerasi zebras demanding tribute from some of the yeti warlords. This brought great shame and discontent to the entire race. As the demands of tribute increased, one yeti realized what he had to do.\n\nHis origins are not well known. Some say he was the child of a thundercloud in the sky, others say he was born from an egg on a mountaintop. The most reasonable explanation is that he was merely an ordinary creature with dreams of greatness. He himself claimed to be a force of nature, an uncontrollable storm, greater than any other creature on the planet. He saw it as his destiny to conquer the world, and acquire enough magical artifacts to become godlike.\n\nHe started as little more than an ambitious upstart with few followers. But as he defeated one rival warlord after another, more and more yeti and storm creatures flocked to his black banner. When the Uzerasi demanded tribute from him, he swiftly defeated them with a new invention: the fearsome airship. This made him so popular that almost all other yeti bowed to him, while the rest were crushed. In a grand coronation ceremony at his newly built extravagant fortress in the Eye of the Storm, he adorned the Horned Crown and abandoned his old identity to become the Storm King."
storm.4.a:0 "We were finally united."

storm.5.t:0 "The Beginning Of Something Great"
storm.5.d:0 "The year after the coronation of the Storm King was spent in consolidation, modernization and formation of a united yeti army. However, these preparations were cut short by a day when the sun did not rise. While confusion and even chaos were common across the world, the Storm King saw it as a perfect opportunity to strike. Within hours, the first yeti units crossed the mountainous border with the Queendom of Hyenia.\n\nThe hyenas had long seen the yeti as uncivilized savages not worth paying attention to. As such, they were completely unprepared for a full-scale invasion. After a year of bitter fighting, the Queendom practically disintegrated and only a small cult of mystics known as the Qaylidi dervishes were able to continue resisting in the northern deserts. Like the Uzerasi Kingdom in the west, Hyenia became part of the Storm Kingdom.\n\nThis was already the greatest victory in the history of yetikind, yet it was only the beginning. The Imperial Mazwi had recently been embroiled in a succession war for several years and were greatly weakened. The assembled might of the entire Empire fled in terror when the yeti airships blotted out the sun and storm creatures tore through their ranks. With their main army destroyed, Mazwi faced provincial revolts and was unable to stop the Storm King from plundering all the major cities in the region. This time, he had no interest in annexing much land and ordered his army to march onwards after looting everything valuable or magical. A non-yeti might've interpreted this act as vengeance for Azarkar's death, but for the yeti this simply proved that Azarkar had been weak while the Storm King was strong. They now fervently believed he would lead them into ever more victories."

storm.6.t:0 "Snowballing"
storm.6.d:0 "Maretania. Osqat. Haymirites. Yemane. Maretonia. Aestlonia. Gargiloya. Senturya. One after another, the kingdoms, duchies, emirates and so on all fell before the Storm King's might, too weak or divided to offer effective resistance against the tide of the yeti and the storm creatures. The Storm Kingdom changed from a rising regional power to a terrifying maelstrom that swept aside all who stood in its way. Of course, many realms gave up without a fight as soon as the Storm King demanded tribute. Those that resisted were punished with extreme severity. Countless cities burned brightly across Zebrica after being completely sacked.\n\nThe Storm King acquired numerous priceless magical artifacts, which increased his power as an individual. Several such items, which he seized from the gargoyles, would prove central to his plans later. However, he did not yet know what to do with them.\n\nWhile his victories were many and he remained undefeated on the battlefield, problems were starting to appear. Much of his army and airship fleet was now dedicated to hauling endless amount of loot back to the Rainband. Not only that, but he struggled to maintain unity of command over great distances. As such, he entrusted some of his generals to lead their own campaigns into eastern Zebrica. Meanwhile, his plans to invade Asstyria and Anseruk were cancelled by Saddle Arabian intervention. He hated to admit it, but his forces had been too spent to face the mighty and modern Grand Principality in battle. As such, he decided to turn north."
storm.6.a:0 "It is never enough."

storm.7.t:0 "Down the Neighle"
storm.7.d:0 "Maregypt was the Storm King's next target. Despite their preparations, they were unable to hold back the tide for long and were forced to retreat to the coast. There, they made a last stand, waiting for aid to arrive from a country called Equestria which they had close ties with. The help never came, so they decided to surrender. Ancient pyramids were emptied of their burial treasures and the Storm King then immediately invaded Abyssinia, a land famed for its wealth. The felines had no counter to his airships, so his flagship soon appeared above the capital, where he broke into the royal palace and forced the King and Queen to surrender their entire treasury.\n\nBut as the Storm King's forces departed Abyssinia, carrying countless valuables, something unexpected happened. His second-in-command and trusted right-hand creature betrayed him, having made a pact with a Macawian pirate captain known as Celaeno. The pirates hijacked numerous airships and escaped, leaving behind the Storm King's sabotaged flagship. Yet he finished repairs quickly and gave chase, capturing the traitor, throwing him overboard and coercing Celaeno and her crew to haul his cargo. However, one airship had gone missing with a valuable magical artifact.\n\nAfter an extensive search, the artifact was found in the hooves of an Equestrian pony who called herself Tempest Shadow. The Storm King was impressed by her ability to evade capture and asked why she had taken the treasure. She explained that she hoped to find a way to restore her broken horn. The Storm King promised when he'd become powerful enough from magic, he'd do it for her. In return, Tempest told him everything about the magical land of Equestria and swore to help him invade it. Thus, Commander Tempest became the Storm King's new second-in-command."
storm.7.a:0 "Did he trust that pony because she was desperate?"

storm.8.t:0 "A Great Defeat for the Zonician People"
storm.8.d:0 "After the meeting with Tempest Shadow, the Storm King formed a clear plan in his head. He would secure the northern Zebrican coast as a staging ground for an overseas invasion of Equestria. Then Tempest would strike the capital of Canterlot with an airship fleet and use Obsidian Orbs, which the Storm King had taken from the gargoyles, to petrify the four alicorn princesses. Then he could use the Staff of Sacanas, also "borrowed" from the gargoyles, to absorb all of their immense magical power. This would've practically made him into a god, capable of controlling the sun and the moon, the power of love and the essence of magic itself.\n\nThe plan was soon set in motion. His forces entered northern Zebrica and spread turmoil everywhere they went. Zarantian zebras were driven into the desert and their city of Tobuck was turned into a supply depot for the planned invasion of Equestria. Warzena and Zumidia were also conquered with relative ease. The isolationist Chiropterrans and Hippogriffs, however, managed to avoid defeat. The former built such impressive fortifications with anti-air defences that the Storm King avoided them entirely, while the latter simply turned into seaponies, abandoned the surface and took everything valuable with them. The Storm King sat upon Queen Novo's throne in Mount Aris as a symbolic act, trying to hide the fact that he had gained absolutely nothing from it. Lastly, he crushed the Colthaginian Republic after its Sufrit boldly rejected the Storm King's demands for tribute. The Sufrit died in the chaos of the battle for Colthage, throwing the country into anarchy. This was good, as it meant they would not interfere with his plans.\n\nThe Storm King looked across the northern ocean. Godhood was within reach."
storm.8.a:0 "We were so close to greatness."

storm.9.t:0 "Disaster"
storm.9.d:0 "Everything was ready for the Storm King's greatest invasion yet. Almost all of his airship fleet and most of his army had gathered in Ain Trotgourait, the occupied capital of Zumidia, preparing for a long overseas surprise attack on Equestria. It would've been daring and dangerous, yet godhood was its ultimate reward, and the Storm King was determined to seize it with Tempest Shadow's help.\n\nHowever, things did not go according to plan.\n\nSix Equestrian heroes (and, apparently, a young dragon) known as the Element Bearers arrived in Seaquestria, the underwater realm where the hippogriffs were hiding. There, they somehow convinced Queen Novo to launch a surprise attack of her own on the Storm King before he could invade the ponies' homeland. Soon, dozens of warships appeared outside of Ain Trotgourait, accompanied by the newly created air force of the hippogriffs. They were using modern planes in numbers that the Storm King had never seen before. They outmaneuvered the larger and slower airships and shot them down with ease. Soon enough, the Storm King's flagship was in flames, while he was still in his headquarters inside the Zumidian royal palace.\n\nWhat exactly happened during the Battle of Ain Trotgourait is still unclear, as is the reason for the hippogriffs' sudden change of heart. But at the end of the battle, Tempest Shadow was forced to choose between her superior and her homeland, and ultimately chose the latter. The Storm King was turned to stone with one of his own Obsidian Orbs and fell to his death from a balcony, shattering into dozens of pieces. The ponies and the hippogriffs stood triumphant, and the Storm King's army scattered. It was leaderless, confused and, for the first time, defeated."
storm.9.a:0 "This defeat was a bitter drop to swallow."

storm.10.t:0 "Every Yeti for Themselves"
storm.10.d:0 "With the death of the Storm King and the defection of his second-in-command, the army was thrown into complete disarray. Multiple commanders proclaimed themselves to be the new supreme leader and almost immediately clashed with each other, even while the hippogriffs were still attacking them. Soon some officers realized the situation was beyond recovery and tried to retreat with whatever forces they could gather. However, the local Zumidian zebras attacked them and lynched any stray yeti or storm creature. Some went into hiding, others surrendered and were taken prisoner. Most soldiers died in the complete chaos.\n\nSeveral small groups of airships managed to escape Ain Trotgourait. They began a lengthy journey across Zebrica back home that was almost legendary in scope. Every realm they passed through was hostile, their supplies were low and infighting was constant. Yet miraculously, they eventually made it back home, confirming the rumours of the Storm King's defeat.\n\nSome of the yeti were still campaigning in eastern Zebrica when they heard the news. Reactions were varied: they either returned home, tried to become mercenaries or bandits, or, in the case of generals Alokassa and Boltrus, decided to carve out their own realms."
storm.10.a:0 "The darkest time in our history."

storm.11.t:0 "Chaos Reigns"
storm.11.d:0 "The Storm King had no clear successor. Every yeti and storm creature knew this, and tried their best to avoid a succession war. Several tense negotiations were held in the Eye of the Storm between various generals, officials and other influential figures. Yet there was no consensus, and the last negotiation attempt ended up in a bloody fight where several yeti and storm creatures were killed. Those who had taken part in negotiations soon began to rally support for themselves and making secret deals with each other, forming several factions which split and merged several times. No one managed to achieve enough support to proclaim themselves the new Storm King or Queen, however. Civil war seemed inevitable.\n\nNo one knows who fired the first shot. Some say the civil war already began during the failed negotiations. All that is clear that soon enough, Tartarus broke loose and the Storm Kingdom fractured, with several rival governments forming, proclaiming themselves to be the rightful ones and denouncing each other. There were at least a dozen such warlords, but within months their numbers had reduced to four: [SLC.GetNameDef], [GYZ.GetNameDef], [THU.GetNameDef] and [STM.GetNameDef]."
storm.11.a:0 "May the strongest one win."

storm.12.t:0 "Gyzwindids and the Directorate" ### Draco
storm.12.d:0 "To the north of the home isle came to be the Gyzwindid Realm, the last of the factions to arise and contend in the civil war.\n\nEnduring conscription, poor management and instability as a result of the newly annexed Hazyeb territories; it should be no surprise that the northern stretches of the Rainband were not keen to endure another autocrat’s reign. Even as war loot was used to fund the industrialisation of the home isle, the largely rural regions of the mainland saw little tangible change in their way of life. It was for these reasons that the key players in Karen and landowners in the surrounding areas scrambled to avoid the influence of other contenders for succession when news of the Storm King’s death reached the Rainband. Thus came Gyz Windborn from the mountains with an offer that they couldn’t refuse.\n\nTo the west lies the Zwahile and the old territories of the Uzerasi that now play host to the Icepaw Provisional Directorate and its soldiers.\n\nAfter the crushing of the pink kingdom and the annexation of the Zwahile as a whole, a significant amount of work was required to restore the region. Fortunately for the overwhelming majority of zebras there, a creature willing to do just such an amount of work whilst cooperating with the locals would soon arrive. Ibyz Icepaw was no pushover and brutal when necessary, but she was equally respectful to those that made themselves useful. When word of the tragedy at Ain Trotgourait spread, she wished at first to swear fealty to the most reasonable candidate for succession; but it quickly became clear that no such candidate existed. All around her were greedy schemers and mad tyrants in waiting, none of whom wished to cooperate with one another. So it was that the officer decided to throw her own metaphorical hat into the ring as she forged the territory into an efficient war government."
storm.12.a:0 "The burned and the principled."

storm.13.t:0 "Thundaria and the Regency" ### Draco
storm.13.d:0 "To the east can be found the remnants of the Storm King’s magical menagerie, collated by the creature that now rules the Thundarian Magocracy.\n\nAlthough composed primarily of Hyenas, the territory that Tenzfur Thunderbringer has carved out is at the very least not wholly foreign to him. The mage turned warlord made every effort to cover his tracks into the east until it was far too late for the civil servants and advisors in the Eye of the Storm to do anything about him and his antics. Most were more concerned about the Storm King’s riches in any case, not those bizarre trinkets that he had such a fixation with. Anyone with a modicum of experience in the king’s armies knew better, however. They were not surprised to discover that Tenzfur had carved out his own corner of the realm in the months preceding the beginning of the civil war with those very ‘trinkets’. Some fear him and others see him as the logical successor to the Storm King, but all agree that he has no intention of simply giving up his collection.\n\nTo the south, down in the home isle of Stormland, is the ‘official’ regency council of the kingdom; although in reality it is anything but.\n\nIkvus Hailstorm was the Storm King’s head of public relations and took every opportunity to advance his own career which simultaneously earned the late monarch’s respect and caused everyone else much frustration. His influence and power grew no matter how many complaints were lodged, of course. In the death of the Storm King he saw his greatest opportunities yet; first a chance to get an even better deal with whoever replaced him, and then to be that very replacement. Needless to say that few in the legions were particularly enthused by this sudden change of pace in his campaigning, but money talks all the same. It wasn’t long before he’d successfully bribed enough people in enough places to be able to lunge after his prize."

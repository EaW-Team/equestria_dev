### "Sunrise Parabellum" Focus Event Chain


dread_start.1.t:0 "On the Path to Destiny"
dread_start.1.desc:0 "Despite having lived in Magehold for years now, Wilted Rose never quite got used to the constant trepidation that she felt while walking the streets. Even with the Rebound's protection, it was still very dangerous for mortals to exist here, though they were at least safer inside the city than outside of it.\n\nIt had been some years since Wilted first arrived in the Dread League, but this "nation" hardly felt like a real country. Over one thousand years ago, a small group of pony exiles stumbled upon an ancient underground vault of sealed, extremely powerful magical knowledge and built a settlement on top of it. Since then, it had become a sprawling, disorganized metropolis on the edge of a frozen peninsula, kept just warm enough with magic so that the unfortunate souls who still clung to their flesh did not perish.\n\nAt least what I'm doing here is important, Wilted told herself, as she passed by a pit filled with bruised and battered ponies drained of color and barely breathing. They were no doubt being used as livestock by vampires and would never know the freedom she held. She shuddered as she looked away. She couldn't help them without compromising her mission. A mission for which she'd sacrificed many of her morals to get here and would see through to the end, no matter what.\n\nThe mission in question had many steps, and the next one was for Wilted to attend the next meeting between the Dread Lord and his subordinates. It was about the League's plans for the future, if memory served. She looked up toward the grand tower ahead of her - the grim castle held a stark contrast to Canterlot Castle back home, though unlike that place, she was welcome here.\n\nJust as she began to ascend the steps, a voice called out to her from her left. "Hey, Wilty! I haven't seen you in months! Looks like we'll be joining each other at this meeting." Wilted blinked as she turned to spot an old acquantince of hers, Right Choice, or... what was his new name again? Electus Mordatoris? She never particularly liked the League's tradition of merging names with titles - once you achieved a noteworthy position, your name became merged with that position.\n\nStill, a familiar face was a rare sight in this place. She offered a slight smile and beckoned him to follow her. "Yeah. Maybe Corpus will actually have a coherent plan for once."" #TODO I'm thinking this can be an introductory scene to the event chain, Rosa marching through Magehold to the officer meeting in the next event. Go wild here to give some neat details on DED lore. Also, you could tease the guy that can become Mordator here. Or you can mention him in the following event.
dread_start.1.a:0 "Lies a friend and a foe."

dread_start.2.t:0 "The Best Laid Plans..."
dread_start.2.desc:0 "It wasn't long before Wilted Rose and Electus Mordatoris entered the Dread Lord's war room. It had taken her a lot of favors with the Animus Institute to earn her place here, and she did not intend to waste them. She took a moment to look around. The war room was a contradictory mixture of brutal architecture and lavish decorations. Ornate candles, tables, and other niceties lined the walls, while the central table was a simple, hexagonal surface with centuries of wear and tear. Evidently, it had not been maintained since the Magisterium had enchanted the thing to display a magical map of the entire peninsula.\n\nSurrounding the table were a number of officers and other underlings in conversation, as well as the Dread Lord himself. Corpus Maledictus, as usual, was not wearing his crown. Instead, his rotting face was on full display with an equally ragged cloak, unbefitting of his status. Wilted knew that Corpus was arrogant, but his brazen disregard for his appearance seemed almost insulting to everyone around him.\n\nHer thoughts were interrupted by an outburst from Corpus. "For the last time, Dominus, yes! I want him dead! Torygg is a rallying figure for the Arcturians, and once he dies, their morale will shatter, and then we can finally destroy them!"\n\n"This will be a very costly maneuver, but consider it done, my liege," said a deep, resonating voice. Wilted blinked as she spotted the enigmatic vampire lord known as Count Dominus. She had only seen him once before, and that was enough to send shivers down her spine. Just the way he walked, it almost seemed like he was floating across the ground. "Shall we move to discuss our upcoming attack?"\n\nWilted carefully stepped between two other officers, both liches, and listened as Corpus explained their planned preliminary strike against the Arcturians. Most of the strategies proposed were reliable, if unexciting, but one detail caught her attention. "...and finally, we shall feign defeat and retreat to instill a false sense of confidence in them."\n\nThere were a few murmurs of discontent among the crowd. Wilted sensed that some in attendance did not agree with Corpus' plan, but they were too afraid to speak out. Now was the time for her to make her first move. She stepped forward, took a deep breath, then said..." #TODO Rosa enters the room where Corpus is talking about his plans. There's clear discomfort with some elements of it amongst the assembled officers, Rosa can either speak out or stay silent. Maybe Corpus & Dominus talking about his hit on Order leadership? NOTE: We might want to figure those details out.
dread_start.2.a:0 ""This is a bad plan. Morale is important for the Arcturians, and feigning defeat would bolster theirs."" #TODO Gotta challenge the old man's authority, ya know? Leads into the next event.
dread_start.2.b:0 ""Stop complaining. We need to stay united if we are to defeat the Arcturian Order."" #TODO Sometimes unity in stupidity, is better than being a dividing smartass. Gives Rosa a national leader trait about her 'Stalwart' nature. Best for appeasing factions later on.

dread_start.201.t:0 "In Hot Water"
dread_start.201.desc:0 "Silence befell the room as Wilted Rose spoke out against the Dread Lord. Few dared to question his decisions, much less tell him to his face that his ideas were terrible. Even her friend Electus was stunned. Still, this was necessary for Wilted's plan to succeed, so she had to bear the consequences.\n\nCorpus Maledictus locked eyes with her. "Who do you think you are? A lowly mortal playing as a lord? Or are you that eager to give up your life?"\n\n"I'm just pointing out that your plan will not work out how you want it to. I have a perspective you don't: I'm still alive, and I know what is important to mortals."\n\nCorpus expressed nothing but contempt. "The nerve of the living in this day and age. I have over seven hundred years of experience, mortal. I know what they're like." He scoffed, "Do not question me again."\n\nWilted pressed further. "Do you always dismiss advice when it's given to you? Or do you wait for your plans to go wrong and then blame a subordinate for not pointing out how failure could have been avoided?" Through the corner of her eye, she noticed the barest hint of a grin from Count Dominus.\n\nCorpus' face contorted into rage. "Silence! My plan of feigning defeat has no flaws, and you all will carry it out!" He briefly paused, his gaze boring deeper than ever before into Wilted, "Do not think your worth as a mage frees you from consequences, Wilted Rose. Lest you wish your corpse to find itself in the hooves of the Stitchers."\n\nWilted glanced around. A few others seemed to enjoy this little spectacle. She had likely earned herself a few supporters, as well as instilling doubt in others about Corpus' leadership capabilities. She allowed herself a slight smirk. Now, for the final act in this movement. She stepped back, bowed, and said..." #TODO This event only fires is Rosa choses to speak out, this is Corpus's response to her where he tries to shoot her down... to which she may back down but the officers will take note and partly implement her ideas. Though if we want to add more options, we could have her double down before promptly leaving. And she gets an extra point on the "I pissed off Corpus" checklist
dread_start.201.a:0 ""Very well. We shall all do as you say."" #TODO Rosa concedes. Gives her a national leader trait between the two extremes.
dread_start.201.b:0 ""Very well. When this plan fails, we will all know why."" #TODO Rosa doubles down. She gets a national leader trait about her hardheadedness. Not as good for faction building, but that rethoric can give her stronger options when dealing with the issues of the League.

dread_start.3.t:0 "The Aspiring Necromancer"
dread_start.3.desc:0 "The meeting between the Dread Lord and his subordinates had stirred quite the pot around the League. Rumors of discontent persisted in the shadows, and despite most everyone keeping up the appearances of loyalty, Wilted Rose could tell that more and more mages were becoming fed up with Corpus' bullheadedness.\n\nHowever, the upcoming attack against the Arcturians was still a ways away, giving her time to enact the next phase of her plan. The annual Immortal Games were set to begin in a few days, and she needed all the help she could get to win, or at the very least, perform well enough to earn the recognition she needed. To that end, she decided to meet with some of her colleagues within the Animus Institute.\n\n---\n\n"...and that's why I need your help to perfect the spell matrix before the games. Any questions?"\n\nOne lich raised his hoof. "Yes. Have you lost your mind? Intelligent ghouls are one thing, but what you're asking... It's impossible. It's never been done, not ever."\n\nWilted stood firm, looking over the assortment of living and undead mages. "There's a first for everything. If I can pull this off, I'll win for sure."\n\nOne individual, the sole vampire of the group, sighed in exasperation. "In all likelihood this will end with you making a fool of yourself," she paused, then chuckled, "But if it means a chance of seeing the look on Corpus' face as he's taken down by a mere child—ahem, forgive me, a young adult mare, then I will gladly help however I can."\n\n"Believe me, you'll get front-row seats for that. And what about the rest of you?" Wilted watched as each in the room begrudgingly agreed to help, despite their doubts. She sighed in relief. "Thanks. You have no idea how much this means to me."\n\nThere was a knock at the door. A skeleton guard reached over to open it, and in walked a decrepit-looking lich. He was holding a tome, and what was left of his eyes seemed utterly glazed over, like he was barely aware of his surroundings. "I have a book on... advanced sapience matrices? It's for... some filly named Rose? I'm afraid I can't remember..."" #TODO Aftermath event, where Rosa talks to her own forces. It will fire a couple days after, so you can probably have it written as being some time later from the previous ones. Maybe act as an introduction to some of the characters within the Institute? You should also have Vitus come here and foreshadow the upcoming games that will happen before the assault.
dread_start.3.a:0 "Wilted Rose grinned, "Thank you, Vetus. Now, we can begin.""



### "A Show Of Force" Focus Event Chain

dread_start.4.t:0 "Ruminations"
dread_start.4.desc:0 "The dim candlelight of Corpus Maledictus' chamber cast faint light and fainter shadows around the ancient lich. He paced back and forth, mumbling words to himself over and over. "Useless fools... wasting their time on a stupid tradition..." He peeked through his chamber's open window at the arena below his castle. "...and to think I have to fight the winner every year! And for what? Glory? We could be marching on the Arcturians right now, and-"\n\n"My lord," a sharp voice pierced Corpus' thoughts. He reflexively fired a magical bolt at the intruder, only to watch it crackle in the air as it paused right before reaching them, then reflect back out of the window. Only then did Corpus realize who he had attacked: Sanctae Tenebrae, once his teacher, now the High Priestess of the Circle of the Salvific Ossuary, or the Circle for short. "The Rebound still works, Corpus. Or have you forgotten?"\n\nHe scoffed. "Of course. You think me a fool?"\n\n"No. I think you have become paranoid." Sanctae walked over to join Corpus next to the window. The engravings on her bones shined under the night sky. "The Immortal Games will be concluding soon. You should come face the winner, or you'll lose what little respect you have left."\n\nCorpus said nothing, and soon enough, the other lich departed. His eyes narrowed as he watched her leave. Paranoid? Him? Why would she say something like that? Did this have anything to do with the vampires of House Rubra taking an unannounced trip to Aquileia? They were his biggest supporters outside of the Circle, but if Rubra was unavailable, then... His mind raced as he reached over to retrieve an enchanted strongbox he kept hidden in the wall. He gazed into the shaped onyx that guaranteed him immortality: his phylactery. He clutched it tightly as he felt a chill enter the room. If there truly was a conspiracy against him, then surely they would try to steal away his phylactery. After all, losing it would make him their slave... or worse.\n\nThe wind picked up. "Perhaps..." Corpus thought aloud, "Perhaps it would be best if I kept this on me..." He reasoned to himself that none would ever attempt to strike him down, thinking it pointless to attack a lich without taking out their phylactery first.\n\nHis thoughts were interrupted again by a bell and muffled cheers in the distance. He tucked his phylactery away in his clothing." #TODO Introductory event to the Immortal games, probably some sort of "aperitif" while waiting for the finalist to get his chance at Corpus, we can have it from Corpus's perspective as it gets us a little insight on his unstable situation from his inward perspective. Maybe show his paranoïa a bit? Plus we can introduce some CSO members here. And maybe an off mention of Rubra being out doing her little sightseeing in Griffonia (Poor Corpus, his brainrot made him forgor.) The event ends with Rosa's victory in the tournament, leading into the preparation of hers and Corpus' match.
dread_start.4.a:0 "The Immortal Games was about to reach its climax."

dread_start.5.t:0 "The Immortal Games"
dread_start.5.desc:0 "Conceived in 213 by Carnes Maledictus as a method of elevating promising mages to higher status, the Immortal Games is an annual event held by the Dread League. Contestants sign up by the thousands to prove their worth, but due to the unusual nature of the competition, they do not actually participate themselves. Instead, each provides a champion of their creation - for necromancers, this means crafting and perfecting their finest undead, while vampires select and empower their favorite thrall with their blood.\n\nThe games themselves often prove to be extremely brutal and bloody, as the rounds traditionally start with a free-for-all fight to the death, followed by a structured tournament bracket for the survivors. Those who place highly in the games gain significant social status with their peers, while the winner obtains the coveted prize of a one-on-one fight against the Dread Lord.\n\nA fight that Wilted Rose was ready for. Through sheer determination, she had managed to pull through to the very end, even besting her friend Electus Mordatoris in the finals. She could tell he was disappointed, but she needed this more than him. Her life's goal was just around the corner. She could feel it.\n\nNow, she sat in her prep room, making some last-minute adjustments to her chosen undead. The spell matrix she had worked on with her peers to control the thing had proven more than effective, but there was still something amiss. Her ghoul was smart, yes, but nowhere near the likes of an undead with memories of its old life. By design, hers was purely her own creation, with no past experiences to draw upon. So what was wrong with it?\n\n"Young... young mare, are you there?" wheezed an addled voice. Wilted turned her head to see none other than Vetus Maledictus, the first Dread Lord, now the Librarian of Magehold. Time had not been kind to him, and he could barely think straight nowadays. After she waved at him, he slowly walked towards her. "Your... matrix. It's special... you... have potential..."\n\nShe offered him a kind smile. "I appreciate it. Thanks for the tome earlier. I know how hard it is to find specific spells in the Library."\n\nFor a moment, he stared off into space, then nodded and departed. Wilted made a mental note to visit Vetus later. Despite his severe mental degradation, he was much nicer to talk to than the majority of creatures in the League.\n\nThere was still, however, the match against Corpus to worry about, and Wilted didn't have much time left. She finalized her adjustments, considered her strategy, and settled on one that would ensure her triumph over the Dread Lord." #TODO here we get Rosa's PoV, preparing for her match, Vetus talking to her. Probably mentions her special spellmatrix?
dread_start.5.a:0 "Defense, reconnaissance, decisive action. My champion shall win with a single critical strike." #TODO Essentially dodging until an opening shows up to slam his horn inside its chest and fire off a spell right into it. A proper show of skill, he won't be happy about losing, but such a direct killing blow is respectable.
dread_start.5.b:0 "Whittle him down. Run circles around him. Then, when he gets angry, bait him to his demise." #TODO Back and forth, slowly damage him, then grab his leg with telekinesis before killing it in its stumble. Kinda playing with your food and finishing it off with a dirty trick. Pisses Corpus off immensely.
dread_start.5.c:0 "Unrelenting aggression. He will not expect it, and that gives me an edge." #TODO She doesn't even try to hide her trick and gives Corpus' skeleton a very bad time. This is the most brutal defeat and the one he will respect the most. A proper show of force.
#These options each give Rosa a unique trait as a general.

dread_start.6.t:0 "Showdown" 
dread_start.6.descA:0 "The climactic fight began with all the fierceness that one would expect from the most powerful lich in the Dread League. Corpus Maledictus may have looked old and decrepit, but his champion was his polar opposite. A tall, equine skeleton with broad bones that moved much more swiftly than any undead that Wilted had seen before. She didn't even have time to command her ghoul to move out of the way of the first attack, but fortunately, it possessed enough intelligence to dodge the incoming strike of its own accord.\n\nFrom there, Wilted tried to avoid as many attacks as she could and deflect those that she could not. She needed to buy time to analyze Corpus' attacks. Unfortunately, she was quickly being backed into a corner as her ghoul was forced to make increasingly uneven trades against the elder lich's champion. Panic began to set in as Wilted realized that her ghoul's half-baked sapience matrix simply could not keep up with the intense micromanagement of the Dread Lord.\n\nWilted commanded her champion to make a break to the right in an attempt to gain ground. As expected, the skeleton immediately gave chase. Things took a turn for the worse as Corpus' champion broke off a sharp bone fragment from itself and threw it at Wilted's ghoul. The fragment became lodged into the left hind leg, hindering the ghoul's ability to flee.\n\nSoon enough, Corpus caught up to her. His skeleton sliced at her ghoul, connecting again and severing muscle tissue in the other hind leg. Her ghoul collapsed to the ground, and the crowd cheered as they smelled blood. Wilted's heart sank as she realized that she was not going to win this. However, just as Corpus' champion was about to deliver the final blow, her ghoul turned around and raised its left forehoof directly at the blade, causing it to be impaled deep into the hoof.\n\nWilted was so shocked at the maneuver that she did not capitalize on it. Her ghoul, however, possessed the intelligence needed to do exactly that. It pulled its hoof back and Corpus' skeleton along with it, and with a single swift motion with its remaining hoof, it extracted the bone fragment from its leg and severed the skeleton's neck bone, causing it and the rest of the skeleton to shatter into hundreds of pieces.\n\nThe crowd erupted into chaos. The last time the Dread Lord had been bested in the Immortal Games was so long ago that nearly half of the attendees had never seen it occur. As for Corpus, Wilted could see that he was very mildly irritated. He glared at her, and so..." #TODO they have their little fight. Rosa can choose to either further humiliate him or not. the various descs are for whichever option is picked in the previous event. Obviously, Corpus loses every time.
dread_start.6.descB:0 "The climactic fight began with all the fierceness that one would expect from the most powerful lich in the Dread League. Corpus Maledictus may have looked old and decrepit, but his champion was his polar opposite. A tall, equine skeleton with broad bones that moved much more swiftly than any undead that Wilted had seen before. She didn't even have time to command her ghoul to move out of the way of the first attack, but fortunately, it possessed enough intelligence to dodge the incoming strike of its own accord.\n\nFrom there, Wilted commanded her ghoul to trade blows, but only when favorable. Each time she clashed with Corpus, her ghoul chipped away at his skeletal champion's bones. A crack here, a fracture there was what she needed for her plan to work. Unfortunately, she only got a few traded blows before Corpus adjusted his tactics and renewed his attacks with added fervor, giving her little time to think.\n\nSuddenly, her ghoul broke to the right, catching Wilted off guard. She was surprised, but realized that it made that maneuver to avoid being backed into a corner. She capitalized on this opportunity and had her ghoul perform a forward somersault and a jump to taunt Corpus. The move had the desired effect of pissing him off, as his champion charged forward at full speed.\n\nNow to bring an end to this, Wilted thought. She willed her ghoul to dodge and attack. However, her ghoul did not move. It simply turned to face the skeleton charging toward it. Wilted internally screamed. Why wasn't it moving?! Was something wrong with its sapience matrix?\n\nJust as Corpus' champion reached hers, it produced a sharpened blade to slice off the ghoul's head. However, instead of getting beheaded, Wilted's ghoul raised its hoof and angled it to impale the blade deep inside its hoof's bone. Without hesitation, it yanked its hoof back, causing Corpus' skeleton to stumble forward. Then, the ghoul crunched on the skeleton's neck with its jaw as hard as it could, shattering its teeth, but also severing the neck bone in the process. With the link to its body severed, the skeleton shattered into hundreds of pieces.\n\nThe crowd erupted into chaos. The last time the Dread Lord had been bested in the Immortal Games was so long ago that nearly half of the attendees had never seen it occur. As for Corpus, Wilted could see that he was very clearly irritated. He glared menacingly at her, and so..."

She didn't even have time to command her ghoul to move out of the way of the first attack, but fortunately, it possessed enough intelligence to dodge the incoming strike of its own accord.\n\nFrom there, Wilted commanded her ghoul to counterattack as hard and fast as possible. It immediately responded by lunging at the skeleton and tackling it to the ground. The ghoul furiously pummeled Corpus' champion, fracturing several bones in quick succession. Despite receiving significant damage, the skeleton managed to shove its assailant off, but only barely. Without so much as a second of hesitation, the ghoul leaped forward again and latched its maw onto the skeleton's left foreleg. It crunched down with such force that its teeth shattered, but so did the leg bone, effectively crippling the creature. Wilted afforded a glance at Corpus, noting that he looked beyond furious at how the fight was playing out.\n\nIt wasn't time to gloat yet, however. She willed her ghoul to rip the creature apart, but... it didn't do that. In fact, it quickly backed off from Corpus' champion. She mentally screamed at the thing. Why wasn't it obeying her commands?! Was something wrong with its sapience matrix? She had this fight in the bag, and-\n\nSomething caught her eye. A blade was present at the edge of the skeleton's unharmed forehoof, and it had just swung at empty air where the ghoul was a second ago. This implied that her ghoul not only possessed the capability to predict the future without relying on external stimuli, but that its intuition was lightning-fast.\n\nWhile she was still processing that, her ghoul charged the skeleton again, feigning a dodge to the left. It raised its blade out to slice at the ghoul, but the ghoul raised its hoof and angled it in such a way that the full force of its leg impacted the tip of the blade and lodged it deep inside. Without hesitation, her ghoul pulled its hoof to the side with such force that it ripped off the skeleton's entire foreleg. With the loose bony limb attached to its own, the ghoul viciously beat Corpus' champion until the skull shattered, ending the fight.\n\nThe crowd erupted into chaos. The last time the Dread Lord had been bested in the Immortal Games was so long ago that nearly half of the attendees had never seen it occur. As for Corpus, Wilted could see that he was absolutely seething. He glared menacingly at her, and so..."

Known for his extensive narcissism, Corpus would have been just another lich if he had not possessed enough magical talent to overpower anyone who challenged him. Within his first few years of unlife, he had already proven himself to be more adept at necromancy than the vast majority of his peers. His skills attracted the attention of the Salvific Ossuary, which quickly inducted Corpus into their order.\n\nIn the centuries that followed, Corpus steadily rose through the ranks of the cult. This drew the ire of his fellow cultists, who knew that he obtained his positions not through religious zealotry, but through his natural talents. Perhaps the greatest heresy in their eyes was when Corpus became the High Priest in 941. Corpus didn't care about their religion in the slightest, but he couldn't resist the power that came with the position, for it earned him a seat on the Dread Council.\n\nSince then, he had neglected to do anything of substance for the religion he was in charge of, instead using and abusing his power to secure his position above all else. In 996, resentment within the cult's ranks had nearly reached a boiling point when their greatest wish came true: Corpus renounced his position as High Priest. He had taken a greater seat of power, one that previously belonged to the late Luvenis Maledicta, who had suffered her final death in her ill-fated conquest against the Arcturians.\n\nThus began the reign of the newest Dread King, Corpus Maledictus. A selfish lich who only takes action when it benefits him, and few are powerful enough to stand in his way.\n\n§YPortrait By:§! Neither"

For the next thirty years, she travelled Griffonia as a nomadic scholar, gathering knowledge wherever she went.

Skellinore is not and never has been a warrior in her past life, and when the truth came out, her summoner was very displeased. Had any other necromancer done the deed, they would have cut the tendrils of unlife on a seemingly useless being.\n\nObit Animata, however, deemed the ritual of raising an intelligent undead too much of an investment to rid himself of Skellinore. He instead drafted the former scholar as a leader of his militia, despite Skellinore's reluctance and ineptitude.\n\nWith the threat of oblivion should she disappoint her new master, Skellinore had no choice but to take the helm as Obit Animata's militia leader. Though she had many difficulties, Skellinore has grown into her new position. In time, she has developed the logistical and experience needed to lead Obit Animata's hosts with a degree of competency that has yet to upset him.\n\nThis was not a path that Skellinore had ever considered in her previous life or this unlife. However, it is one that she can perhaps excel at despite all of the odds stacked against her. Maybe one day, she may even break free of her unlife of indentured servitude.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Egil"

### Focuses ###
CVA_the_revolution_has_begun:0 "Кольтванская революция"
CVA_the_revolution_has_begun_desc:0 "После долгих лет борьбы мы, наконец, сделали первый шаг к освобождению Кольтвы от угнетения. К оружию, фермеры и рабочие Кольтвы! Мы будем защищать нашу автономию до последнего вздоха!"
CVA_the_end_of_the_junta:0 "Конец революционной хунты"
CVA_the_end_of_the_junta_desc:0 "Хотя именно революционная хунта позволила нам вести свою долгую борьбу, мы не намерены позволить военному режиму управлять страной, как это сделали заркиды. Мы обеспечили нашу автономию и поэтому можем начать переход к гражданскому правительству."
CVA_follow_through_with_our_promises:0 "Следовать плану Кизил-Зеб"
CVA_follow_through_with_our_promises_desc:0 "Обещания народу Кольтвы, изложенные в плане Кизил-Зеб, представляют собой наши основные обязательства, и мы должны их выполнять. Мы сокрушим олигархов, которые так долго эксплуатировали нас, а богатство, которое они отняли у народа, будет возвращено ему обратно."
CVA_nozebra_left_behind:0 "Ни души не останется позади"
CVA_nozebra_left_behind_desc:0 "Сколько же мыслителей, учёных, поэтов и лидеров бездействуют в Кольтве, закованные в цепи неграмотности и ограниченные запущенной системой образования? Слишком много. Мы должны вложить немало средств в образование, чтобы освободить наш народ от интеллектуальной нищеты."
CVA_support_urban_development:0 "Сотрудничать с городскими интеллектуалами"
CVA_support_urban_development_desc:0 "Хотя ядро нашего движения состояло из сельского крестьянства, немалая часть городской интеллигенции сочувствовала нам. Эти новые товарищи явно окажутся неоценимыми в управлении страной, поскольку даже децентрализованной республике нужны бюрократы."
CVA_neuter_zarza:0 "Отдать должное мяснику"
CVA_neuter_zarza_desc:0 "Зарза с самого начала сеял сомнения и подстрекал к саботажу среди горожан, которые скептически относились к нашей революции. Он даже предпочёл бы, чтобы заркиды вернулись, дабы он мог снова править как один из их политических вождей. У нас более чем достаточно доказательств для его ареста и суда. Нам нужно действовать быстро, чтобы добиться этого."
CVA_immortalise_the_revolution:0 "The Immortal Revolution"
CVA_immortalise_the_revolution_desc:0 "#TODO"
CVA_deradicalise_the_LAE:0 "Соглашение хорошего понедельника"
CVA_deradicalise_the_LAE_desc:0 "Борьба окончена и угнетатели повержены. Теперь мы должны двигаться в будущее и строить светлое завтра, а не вечно мстить за несправедливость прошлого. Мы сядем за стол переговоров с униженными бывшими врагами и разработаем соглашение для обеспечения прочного мира."
CVA_really_modern_labour_laws:0 "Защитить рабочий класс Кольтвы"
CVA_really_modern_labour_laws_desc:0 "Олигархи эксплуатировали рабочих в некоторых областях с помощью неравных законов, но в других сферах они эксплуатировали нас из-за полного отсутствия законов. Озид предложил надёжный набор мер по защите труда, дабы каждый кольтванец мог получить достойную работу и справедливую заработную плату."
CVA_promote_free_trade:0 "Поощрять свободную торговлю"
CVA_promote_free_trade_desc:0 "У нас нет никакого желания создавать автаркию. Глупо пытаться сделать это в такой маленькой стране вроде нашей. Мы установим прочные торговые отношения с другими нациями, чтобы поставлять новые товары и улучшать жизнь нашего народа."
CVA_autonomous_regions:0 "Сельская автономия"
CVA_autonomous_regions_desc:0 "Мы всегда считали, что крестьянину можно доверить управление своей собственной общиной: вся наша революция была основана на доверии, которое мы оказывали простым зебрам. Теперь, когда ситуация стабилизировалась, мы наделим местные крестьянские общины значительной автономией."
CVA_the_principle_of_federalisation:0 "Принять макавианскую модель"
CVA_the_principle_of_federalisation_desc:0 "Без пера мы напрасно поднимали бы свой меч. Мы закрепим свободы, за которые мы так упорно боролись, разработав новую конституцию, основанную не на олигархических документах Кольтфагена, а на конституции Макавии, которая всегда была маяком демократии."
CVA_unban_conservative_parties:0 "The Dual Constitution System"
CVA_unban_conservative_parties_desc:0 "#TODO"
CVA_finish_the_liberation:0 "Continue the War Of Liberation"
CVA_finish_the_liberation_desc:0 "#TODO"

CVA_stick_to_the_plan:0 "Провести земельную реформу"
CVA_stick_to_the_plan_desc:0 "Земельная реформа была одним из ключевых обещаний крестьянам. Мы отнимем землю у олигархов и создадим суды для определения исторических претензий на землю. Затем мы возьмём треть земли, принадлежащей монополистам, и отдадим её, а также те территории, на которых нет явных претендентов, безземельным фермерам, которые трудятся на ней."
CVA_begin_primitive_industrialisation:0 "Примитивная индустриализация"
CVA_begin_primitive_industrialisation_desc:0 "Режим Кольтфагена мало что сделал для улучшения промышленного сектора забытой Кольтвы. Хотя мы постараемся не повторить неудачной индустриализации Сталлионграда, мы начнём импортировать оборудование и обучать наших рабочих современным промышленным методам."
CVA_develop_steel_milling:0 "Сталелитейные заводы Кольтартана"
CVA_develop_steel_milling_desc:0 "Производство стали является ключевым компонентом как военной, так и гражданской промышленности. Мы построим огромный сталелитейный завод недалеко от Кизил-Зеба, чтобы начать производить металл."
CVA_basic_heavy_industry:0 "Субсидировать тяжёлую промышленность"
CVA_basic_heavy_industry_desc:0 "Основная цель экономики - служить народу и обеспечивать его. Но нельзя забывать и про защиту граждан от тех, кто делает завоевать их. Мы должны производить не только масло, но и пушки."
CVA_bauxite_mineing:0 "Расширение бокситовых рудников Кешайма"
CVA_bauxite_mineing_desc:0 "Алюминий очень важен для промышленности и он отлично продаётся на мировом рынке. Мы обнаружили множество бокситов в джунглях вокруг Кешайма, который долгое время не разрабатывался из-за ссор между землевладельцами. Теперь, когда эти землевладельцы ушли, мы можем должным образом использовать эти богатства."
CVA_develop_silver_mines:0 "Серебро Кольтвы"
CVA_develop_silver_mines_desc:0 "Обширные залежи серебра в Кольтве использовались для пополнения карманов союзников Заркида. Теперь, когда это серебро находится под нашим контролем, мы будем продавать его за границу, дабы получить необходимый приток денежных средств для запуска экономики. Однако мы не должны впасть в зависимость от этого источника доходов: мы - нация рабочих, а не клика серебряных баронов."
CVA_connecting_coltva:0 "Железная дорога Кизил-Забула-Кешайм"
CVA_connecting_coltva_desc:0 "Наши общины соединены гравийными дорогами и редкими каменными мостами. Если мы хотим перевозить наши товары и соединить всю страну, то пора начать строить железные дороги между нашими тремя крупными городами."
CVA_major_development:0 "Экономическая шоковая терапия"
CVA_major_development_desc:0 "Чтобы обеспечить наше экономическое благополучие, необходимо осуществить огромные инвестиции в новые заводы, железные дороги... Да во всё! В следующем году мы направим наши усилия на создание современного промышленного сектора, дабы наша армия была оснащена современным вооружением, а наш народ мог наслаждаться удобствами современной жизни даже в самых захолустных сельских городках."
CVA_foreign_experts:0 "Привести иностранных промышленных спецов"
CVA_foreign_experts_desc:0 "Хотя у нас есть несколько местных экспертов, этого недостаточно для развивающегося промышленного сектора. Мы предложим щедрые зарплаты и престижные должности иностранным архитекторам, инженерам, металлургам и ученым-промышленникам. Они обучат новое поколение рабочих Кольтвы самым современным промышленным методам, и скоро уже к нам другие страны обратятся за опытом."
CVA_textile_industry:0 "Поддержать текстильную промышленность Кешайма"
CVA_textile_industry_desc:0 "Наша текстильная промышленность всегда была достаточно развитой, но мы должны и дальше поддерживать эту отрасль промышленности, чтобы сохранять рабочие места и снизить стоимость одежды."
CVA_plantations_for_the_people:0 "Плантации для народа"
CVA_plantations_for_the_people_desc:0 "Мы - государство фермеров и крестьян. Мы расчистим участки пахотных земель для строительства новых плантаций, которые будут совместно обрабатываться и управляться самими фермерами. Они не будут похожи на плантации монокультур, которые предпочитают капиталисты и отстранённые бюрократы: мы будем полагаться на местные знания и севооборот, дабы гарантировать, что почва останется плодородной."
CVA_increase_industrial_mobilisation:0 "Мобилизовать экономику"
CVA_increase_industrial_mobilisation_desc:0 "В современных войнах патроны и прочие припасы имеют свойство очень быстро заканчиваться. Мы должны захватить контроль над ключевыми заводами и использовать их для производства в военное время, если хотим сохранить свою свободу."
CVA_feed_the_people:0 "Маниока, сорго и кукуруза"
CVA_feed_the_people_desc:0 "Наша главная забота должна заключаться в том, чтобы успешно накормить наш народ. Сосредоточив наши плантации на выращивании основных культур, мы можем убедиться в том, чтобы продовольствие всегда было дешевым и легкодоступным. Наш народ сможет наслаждаться обильной и питательной пищей даже в самые трудные времена."
CVA_develop_coffee_fields:0 "Кофе и табак"
CVA_develop_coffee_fields_desc:0 "Сосредоточив наши плантации на выращивании товарных культур, мы сможем продавать их и использовать заработанные средства для улучшения жизни народа. Кроме того, кооперативный характер наших плантаций означает, что сами фермеры получат большую часть прибыли от этих товарных культур."
CVA_develop_the_rubber_fields:0 "Восстановить каучуковые плантации"
CVA_develop_the_rubber_fields_desc:0 "В наших джунглях полно каучуковых деревьев, которые можно использовать на благо нашего народа. Но пока этого не было сделано. Мы будем инвестировать в создание резиновой промышленности, товары которой пойдут как на экспорт, так и на внутренний рынок."
CVA_develop_the_sugar:0 "Сахар и ром"
CVA_develop_the_sugar_desc:0 "Некоторые фермеры считают, что включение сахарного тростника в уже существующую схему севооборота обеспечит нас ценным товарным урожаем, не ухудшив при этом качества почвы. Несколько деревень вокруг этих плантаций также выразили заинтересованность в создании местных винокурен, чтобы они могли начать производство рома, что принесёт деньги в их деревни. Мы должны поощрять эту инициативу."
CVA_mechanisation:0 "Механизация сельского хозяйства"
CVA_mechanisation_desc:0 "Нас иногда называли примитивистами или антииндустриалистами, но это не так. Мы можем и будем интегрировать современные инструменты в наши традиционные методы ведения сельского хозяйства. Поэтому мы можем получить все преимущества механизации, не ставя стабильность сельского хозяйства под удар."
CVA_improve_specialisation:0 "Пусть зерно течёт рекой"
CVA_improve_specialisation_desc:0 "Наша сельскохозяйственная экспансия принесла свои плоды. Простые фермеры лучше питаются и получают достойную зарплату. Они гордятся своей работой и добросовестно заботятся о земле для следующего поколения. Наши жеребята вырастут высокими и сильными, никогда не познав последствий голода."
CVA_the_chocolate_industry:0 "Шоколад Кольтвы"
CVA_the_chocolate_industry_desc:0 "Механизация сельского хозяйства и создание новых плантаций принесли неожиданную пользу: благодаря сахару, который мы сейчас выращиваем, и какао-бобам, которые мы всегда собирали в джунглях, Кольтва стала домом для процветающей шоколадной промышленности. Мы сможем экспортировать этот товар, а также сумеем подсластить армейские пайки."

CVA_the_army:0 "Освободительная Армия Востока"
CVA_the_army_desc:0 "ОАВ уже много лет борется с нашими владыками. У нас и так уже есть немало знаний о том, как эффективно и результативно сражаться. Нам просто нужно объединить эти знания, чтобы создать настоящую доктрину."
CVA_smuggle_in_rifles:0 "Любые винтовки пригодятся"
CVA_smuggle_in_rifles_desc:0 "Когда мы захватили города Кольтвы, силы заркидов отступили неорганизованно. Если мы прочешем местные архивы, то, несомненно, сможем найти многочисленные тайники с оружием и склады, где полно полезных припасов."
CVA_local_arms_manufacturing:0 "Местное производство винтовок"
CVA_local_arms_manufacturing_desc:0 "На протяжении веков мы, зебры, занимались металлургией и изготовлением оружия. Хотя централизованные оружейные заводы более эффективны, в наших нынешних обстоятельствах мы должны полагаться на традицию местных оружейников, чтобы снабжать нашу армию."
CVA_standardise_rifles:0 "Использовать "Гаркано""
CVA_standardise_rifles_desc:0 "ОАВ - это разрозненная толпа из крестьян и рабочих, которые использовали любое пригодное оружие для борьбы. Тем не менее, официальное принятие винтовки "Гаркано" в качестве стандартного оружия упростит процесс производства и оснащения новых подразделений."
CVA_zaboula_academy:0 "Основать военную академию Забулы"
CVA_zaboula_academy_desc:0 "Мы должны объединить наши лучшие военные умы как для подготовки новых офицеров, так и для объединения уже накопленных знаний, чтобы мы могли совершить новые прорывы в военной доктрине, науке и технике."
CVA_support_battalions:0 "Батальоны полевой поддержки"
CVA_support_battalions_desc:0 "Армии нужны не только стрелки. Нам нужны медики, посыльные, разведчики и множество других вспомогательных ролей, чтобы вести войну на современном поле боя. В дни, когда мы были партизанскими силами, каждое подразделение должно было быть самодостаточным, но сейчас мы можем направить создать специальные батальоны поддержки для оказания помощи нашим силам."
CVA_liberation_artillery:0 "Орудия освобождения"
CVA_liberation_artillery_desc:0 "Мы больше не ограничены грузоподъёмностью отдельной зебры и нуждой прятаться в лагерях в джунглях, так что мы можем начать развёртывать пушки, гаубицы и тяжёлые минометы для поддержки нашей пехоты."
CVA_raise_the_militias:0 "Расшевелить крестьян"
CVA_raise_the_militias_desc:0 "Хотя враги клеймили нас предателями и бандитами, мы, ОАВ, всегда были популярны среди угнетенных Кольтвы, а наши лидеры получили статус народных героев. Добровольцы наводняют наши наспех созданные вербовочные пункты, желая присоединиться к борьбе. Мы должны послать офицеров в сельскую местность, чтобы вооружить, обучить и организовать этих восторженных зебр в новые отряды."
CVA_jungle_training:0 "Из джунглей мы вышли"
CVA_jungle_training_desc:0 "Определите цель, нанесите удар, когда враг отвлечётся, исчезните в джунглях и устроите засаду войскам, которые пошлют за нами. Именно так мы вели нашу борьбу в течение многих лет, и заркиды никогда не могли сравниться с нами в войне в джунглях. Мы адаптируем эти эмпирические знания к текущему крупномасштабному конфликту, чтобы наши враги научились бояться джунглей."
CVA_foreign_volunteers:0 "Волонтёры из Казы"
CVA_foreign_volunteers_desc:0 "Века назад корабль рабов восстал против кольтфагенцев и высадился на берегах Грифонии, основав там убежище для всех тех, кто бежал из рабства. Теперь потомки тех же рабов вернулись. Но не для мести, а для того, чтобы помочь нам. Мы приветствуем наших давно потерянных братьев и сестер и клянемся сопротивляться угнетению с тем же рвением, что и они!"
CVA_fighter_fleet:0 "Переоборудовать кукурузники"
CVA_fighter_fleet_desc:0 "У нас нет авиапромышленности, но несколько землевладельцев оставили свои старые самолеты для опрыскивания урожая, когда бежали от нашего наступления. После некоторых модификаций они смогут стать нашим первым крылом истребителей."
CVA_basic_bombers:0 "Импровизированные бомбардировщики"
CVA_basic_bombers_desc:0 "Хотя у нас нет специальных самолётов-бомбардировщиков, ничто не мешает нам использовать гражданские машины. Да, они не ровня полноценным самолётам, но несколько "бочковых" бомб, сброшенных на вражеские формирования, должны заставить их дважды подумать, прежде чем наступать в открытую."
CVA_develop_a_doctrine:0 "Освободительный воздушный флот"
CVA_develop_a_doctrine_desc:0 "Наших авиаторов немного, но каждый из них совершил десятки вылетов. Мы соберем их вместе и объединим их знания, чтобы по мере расширения наших крыльев новые поколения пилотов могли узнавать побольше о воздушных боях."
CVA_the_flying_jaguars:0 "Летающие ягуары"
CVA_the_flying_jaguars_desc:0 "Ягуар может часами прятаться в укрытии, а затем прыгнуть и поймать свою добычу в воздухе, повалив её на землю. Наши истребители должны следовать такой стратегии, прячась в облаках и нанося удары по вражеским бомбардировщикам, прежде чем вернуться на безопасные аэродромы, что защищают зенитные орудия."
CVA_close_range_support:0 "Общевойсковая тактика"
CVA_close_range_support_desc:0 "Теперь, когда у нас есть надлежащие ВВС, мы должны разработать новые, более легкие самолеты-бомбардировщики, которые могут более точно поддерживать нашу пехоту в бою. Мы также обучим наших радистов и артиллерийских корректировщиков работе с ВВС, чтобы максимизировать ущерб и свести к минимуму вероятность потери самолётов или же огня по своим."
CVA_defenders_of_the_homeland:0 "Защитники родины"
CVA_defenders_of_the_homeland_desc:0 "Теперь, когда мы формализовали тактику ОАВ, приобрели оружие и объединили добровольцев, мы готовы начать полномасштабное расширение и реорганизацию армии. ОАВ будет защищать дома и наш народ, независимо от свирепости врага."
CVA_stick_to_the_militias:0 "Реформировать ополчение"
CVA_stick_to_the_militias_desc:0 "Система ополчения хорошо служила нам на протяжении всей нашей долгой борьбы. Нам придётся хорошенько расширить ряды ополчения, но сам децентрализованный характер системы будет способствовать повышению инициативы низшего эшелона. Также боевой дух зебр, сражающихся за свои дома вместе со своими друзьями и соседями, будет весьма высок."
CVA_elected_officers:0 "Выборы офицеров"
CVA_elected_officers_desc:0 "Наши офицеры должны избираться из числа их солдат. Это будет способствовать сближению между завербованными зебрами и их лидерами, что совсем не похоже на бездушное пренебрежение к солдатам, которые привычно для традиций офицеров-аристократов. Мы верим, что зебрам, которые сражаются и умирают бок о бок друг с другом, лучше знать, кто будет вести их в бой."
CVA_autonomous_recruiting:0 "Местный призыв"
CVA_autonomous_recruiting_desc:0 "Деревня похожа на большую семью. Это верно и для взвода. Мы создадим пункты призыва даже в самых отдалённых деревнях и организуем процедуры развертывания войск таким образом, чтобы наши солдаты всегда сражались бок о бок с друзьями и соседями."
CVA_professionalism:0 "Повысить профессионализм ОАВ"
CVA_professionalism_desc:0 "Хотя децентрализованная модель ополчения имеет много преимуществ, её просто недостаточно для крупномасштабной обычной войны, с которой мы, вероятно, столкнемся после освобождения Кольтвы. Мы должны создать дисциплинированные, упорядоченные силы из профессиональных солдат, которые будут строго придерживаться планов, разработанных централизованным верховным командованием."
CVA_actual_officers:0 "Современные методы подготовки офицеров"
CVA_actual_officers_desc:0 "Мы пригласим иностранных инструкторов для подготовки нового поколения офицеров из лидеров ОАВ. Наша армия получит эффективных командиров-новаторов, что руководствуются как современной военной теорией, так и опытом ОАВ."
CVA_proper_discipline:0 "Железная воля и стальное сердце"
CVA_proper_discipline_desc:0 "Романтические идеалы страстного крестьянина-солдата привлекательны, но они уже устарели. Наши офицеры и солдаты должны быть стойкими, непреклонными и беспрекословными при выполнении своих приказов. Они обязаны не сомневаться и должны руководствоваться долгом и дисциплиной, а не гордостью, страстью или личными мотивами."
CVA_hill_warriors:0 "Воины холмов"
CVA_hill_warriors_desc:0 "В другой армии крик "Бежим в горы!" - это сигнал поражения. Для нас же это хитрый финт. Мы обучим наших солдат сражаться в суровых высокогорьях нашей страны, научимся ориентироваться и использовать каждую расщелину и хребет, чтобы устраивать засады, уничтожать и изматывать врага, прежде чем нанести по нему решающий удар."
CVA_limited_motorisation:0 "Использовать машины"
CVA_limited_motorisation_desc:0 "Хотя моторизованные подразделения могут быть не особенно эффективны в горах и джунглях, их мобильность на равнинах невозможно переоценить. Мы должны включить эти подразделения и соответствующую тактику в состав нашей армии, чтобы добиться победы на современном поле боя."
CVA_partisan_legacy:0 "Наследие борьбы"
CVA_partisan_legacy_desc:0 "ОАВ превратилась из разношерстной банды повстанцев в грозную современную боевую силу. Но мы не должны забывать о своих корнях, дабы не превратиться во властную империалистическую организацию подобно многим другим армиям. Новые поколения наших солдат будут знать о наследии, которое они поддерживают и защищают."

CVA_the_navy:0 "Взглянуть на море"
CVA_the_navy_desc:0 "На протяжении веков кольтфагенцы перевозили рабов через море. А наши героические рассказы изобилуют историями о пиратах, совершающих набеги на эти корабли и освобождающих рабов. Если мы хотим вывести наши товары на мировой рынок и разрушить пути наших врагов, нам нужно основать надлежащий флот, чтобы оспорить господство Кольтфагена на морях."
CVA_repurpose_fishing_ships:0 "Перепрофилировать рыболовные суда"
CVA_repurpose_fishing_ships_desc:0 "Некоторые из наших наиболее крупных рыболовецких судов могут быть перепрофилированы для использования в качестве конвоев и вспомогательных военных кораблей."
CVA_build_up_the_shipyards:0 "Постройте верфи в Хорсмузе"
CVA_build_up_the_shipyards_desc:0 "Нам придётся поощрять значительное расширение верфей и сухих доков, чтобы мы могли на равных конкурировать с соседями."
CVA_buildup_fishing_industry:0 "Защищать рыболовов"
CVA_buildup_fishing_industry_desc:0 "Наши враги безжалостны. Они не ограничатся нанесением ударов по военным судам и тем, что перевозят военную технику. Они будут торпедировать даже рыболовецкие суда, чтобы заморить нас голодом и посеять страх. Поэтому эсминцы защитят не только нашу промышленность, но и сам народ."
CVA_seize_colthage_ships:0 "Перепрофилировать законсервированные суда Кольтфагена"
CVA_seize_colthage_ships_desc:0 "Флот Кольтфагена оставил в наших гаванях несколько устаревших кораблей. Хотя они прискорбно устарели, мы всё же можем отремонтировать их, чтобы эти суда укрепили наш флот."
CVA_develop_submarines:0 "Морские партизаны"
CVA_develop_submarines_desc:0 "Искать, наносить удары, исчезать. Именно так мы вели нашу долгую партизанскую войну, и именно так действуют подводные лодки. Мы сосредоточим наши усилия на развитии этих морских рейдеров, чтобы эффективнее мешать судоходству наших врагов и заставить их промышленность страдать от нехватки ресурсов."

zebra_zapata.10.d:0 "When Anzar stepped out of the tribunal, it was all she could to to keep from weeping. In her saddlebag was a court order which would give her life back. It had all happened so fast she could hardly process it, but there it was, in black-and-white: she was getting compensated for the land the rebels had taken from her, and the amount was enough that her family would be rich zebras once again.\n\nAnza had feared for her life when the Zeirudtistas had taken over Coltva, and when her land was confiscated she'd almost been ready to flee, and damn their promises that she would be compensated "when the crisis was over." But today, they'd kept their promise. Her old tenets showed up to the tribunal, one by one, telling their stories of how fair she'd been, how she'd always kept the rents low, how she'd forgiven their debts in the lean years. The three zebras making up her villagee tribunal had deliberated, reviewed documents about historical land claims, and when they'd come to their decision Anza was sure she'd misheard: she was to be paid the full value of the land, and then some.\n\nShe wouldn't get the land back; the age of large landlords was over and it wouldn't even be profitable at this point, but she had enough to invest in the growing industrial sector, or start a business, or whatever she wanted to do! Her foals would grow up affluent, no, they would grow up rich! Running home to give them the good news, she silently thanked her tenets for speaking on her behalf." #Event about a landlord actually being paid back by the government, as stipulated by the original plan

CVA_CTH_fixing_whats_broken_desc:0 "Through the fire and the storm we have fought. Despite the trials, and despite the loss of our beloved leader, we came out on top. Now, at the founding of the great Colthaginian Federation, Zarishat Zeirutid addresses the nation to honor the memory of her dear brother."
CVA_CTH_a1:0 "Punish The Landlords" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a1_desc:0 "Our struggle was born in the farmlands of Coltva thanks to the rapacity of the landlords, and though the path was long, we now are in a position to deal with them for good. No more shall they exploit the common zebra, for today is the day of reckoning!"
CVA_CTH_a2:0 "Target The Scientific Clique" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a2_desc:0 "The Scientifics are still out there, and though they are beaten, they are not yet broken. Unless we make sure to deal with them on a more permanent basis, we will not be able to rest on our laurels. They had their chance, history judged them wanting, and now they pay the price. "
CVA_CTH_a3:0 "Anti-Intellectual Proscriptions" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a3_desc:0 "The republic was in the end little more than a playground for ivory tower intellectuals to engage in endless quibbling as they invented a million forms of reactionary pseudo-ideologies. Yet, there's an equally misguided as widespread pride in this system, and it will not be easily uprooted." 
CVA_CTH_a4:0 "Starites In Our Midst" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a4_desc:0 "Of all the movements that has taken hold in the federation, the Starites must be the most insane of them all. Between their weird esoteric beliefs, their secrecy and utter and complete lack of anything resembling mercy or restraint, they seem more akin to a fever dream than an actual movement. They are real though, and they will need to be dealt with."
CVA_CTH_a5:0 "Tackling The Famine" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a5_desc:0 "Thanks to the chaos of these last years, malnutrition and starvation runs rampant. Between corruption, devastation, mismanagement and seemingly sheer malice, we are not producing even nearly enough to feed the people. This must be addressed, and fast."
CVA_CTH_a6:0 "Redefine The Plan Of Kizil-Zeb" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a6_desc:0 "The Kizil-Zeb Plan saw many successes in Coltva, but Zarishat is unconvinced that it is what the federation needs. The time to make concessions is long since past, and if the lack of a gentle hoof means the reactionaries will be more willing to resist... well isn't that killing two birds with one stone?"
CVA_CTH_a7:0 "Karamane Plantation Collectivisation" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a7_desc:0 "The rubber plantations in southern Zition have long been a cash cow for the state, even if more and more of it has been bought up by private interests. This will be rectified, and the its resources will once more belong to the people."
CVA_CTH_a8:0 "Zeordu Farmland Consolidation" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a8_desc:0 "in Coltva, the land reforms could be steadily carried out over a long time. Now, we will act decisively and swiftly. Zeordu will be the first to be transformed as we carry out our land reforms in one blow. It will be a messy affair, but the lessons learned will allow us to carry our further reforms going ahead with much greater ease."
CVA_CTH_a9:0 "Restructure The Textile Industry" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a9_desc:0 "Colthage's textile industry was born out of an attempt to compete with the Maregyptians' cotton, and it was decently successful at this. A plan has been proposed by Zillquat Zaladid, a former technocrat who joined the socialist cause, under which this industry can be brought into the fold and expanded both."
CVA_CTH_a10:0 "Corrective Labour" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a10_desc:0 "Clemency is a luxury, and luxuries are the mark of the bourgeoisie. Those who fought against us are too many to do away with, but that doesn't mean we can't make sure that they pay us back for the troubles they caused us through toil and sweat."
CVA_CTH_a11:0 "The Work For Bread Program" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a11_desc:0 "The famine must be dealt with posthaste, and as a part of it, a program has been put forth under which food items will constitute valid payment for labour. There are precious few who are not struggling to feed themselves, and this will not only free up monetary resources, but also mitigate their hunger."
CVA_CTH_a12:0 "A Ban On Usury" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a12_desc:0 "The amount of zebras trapped in debt by scheming moneylenders and banks is nothing short of obscene, and the remedy is simple. From this day forward, charging interest will be outlawed completely, and those who have charged too high interest will be forced to pay back said interest."
CVA_CTH_a13:0 "Department Of National Agricultural Organization" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a13_desc:0 "With the tumultous land reforms that have been carried out recently, we will have to make sure to keep clear records of who owns what land, and redistribute it as needed to ensure maximum production. Farmers shall own their lands, true, but the state will administer its distribution."
CVA_CTH_a14:0 "Industrial Reconstruction" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a14_desc:0 "The colthaginian industrial sector is much like its agricultural one; infested with oligarchs and monopolists. As we've started to deal with the issue of the famine, we can now turn our gaze to this field and ensure that the industrial sector is brought in line with the revolutionary ideals as well."
CVA_CTH_a15:0 "Agricultural Quotas" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a15_desc:0 "If the famine shall be defeated, all must give all they can. We can trust in our revolutionary brothers, but there are many farmers who might not be as motivated. If they will not act out of revolutionary zeal, they will simply have to act out of legal obligation as we implement strict quotas to be met."
CVA_CTH_a16:0 "Penal Worker Settlements" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a16_desc:0 "The thousands of reactionaries who now pay off their debt to the federation through labour can be found all over Colthage. In order to make the most of them, it is for the best that we concentrate them to special settlements where work is plenty and security is high."
CVA_CTH_a17:0 "National Department Of Labour" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a17_desc:0 "The labour produced by our people is a precious resources, not to be squandered. Yet the supply and demand is also unevenly distributed. Ozid has spearheaded the creation of a department dedicated to making sure that wherever there is a job that needs doing, we will find someone able to do it."
CVA_CTH_a18:0 "Selective Charity" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a18_desc:0 "The state cannot do everything, and at times, private interests can be helpful. We should encourage and support private initiatives, but that doesn't mean we can't make sure to aid those charities who are friendly to us, and hinder those who have ideas we don't approve of."
CVA_CTH_a19:0 "Restructure The Academia" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a19_desc:0 "The colthaginian institutes of higher learning have a long and proud history, but they are also a fertile breeding ground for technocrats and other counter-revolutionaries. In order to ensure the security of our nation, we will simply have to reorganise them in order to ensure our students learn the right lessons."
CVA_CTH_a20:0 "The Future Of The Nation" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a20_desc:0 "Our universites have been reorganised and expanded, and they are now ready to educate the next generation of federation leaders and scientists."
CVA_CTH_a21:0 "Mass Reindustrialisation" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a21_desc:0 "The age of famine and poverty is coming to an end. Thanks to the efforts of our people and the leadership of our government, we are reaching a point where our industry is well and truly restored to the level of its glory days."
CVA_CTH_a22:0 "Social Justice" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a22_desc:0 "None shall be left behind, and none shall feel like they are ignored by our nation. This is our pledge to the people of the federation, no matter their race or their ancestry."
CVA_CTH_c1:0 "Going Cold Turkey" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c1_desc:0 "Alcohol doesn't ask questions or comment on how your brother is such a shining exemplar. It doesn't make you feel inadequate or force you to live in the shadows of others. It's been her comfort for so long, and gods she will miss it..."
CVA_CTH_c2:0 "Work With Bandolier" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c2_desc:0 "Zannido Zidon is a menace like few, but he is not completely unreasonable. Though he's infamous in most of the country, the prefecture of Zidon views him as a hero. Maybe we should consider working with him? Though it'd be deeply unpopular to many, it'd bring the northwest into our fold as well as give us a talentet general."
CVA_CTH_c3:0 "We Have No Need For Bandits" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c3_desc:0 "Zannido Zidon is a bandit and a murderer. He has no place in the federation except in the deepest dungeon! We have pledged to be the leaders of this land, and how would it look if we bargained with his ilk?"
CVA_CTH_c5:0 "Committee Of Public Salvation" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c5_desc:0 "It'd be naive in the extreme to think that just because we won, the nation will be behind us. Our top priority right now should be to make sure that we give the people safety from all those who would tear down that which we are building."
CVA_CTH_c6:0 "Streamline The Judicial Process" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c6_desc:0 "We will stand behind justice, but we cannot be bogged down in procedure while we do so. Greater weight given to witnesses loyal to our cause, making the defendants defend themselves and similar policies will allow us to expedite the process."
CVA_CTH_c7:0 "Bureaucratic Reconstruction Effort" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c7_desc:0 "The old bureaucracy left from before our victory is not inherently broken. It can still serve us as long as we make sure to pay special heed to flush out any leftover loyalists. That way, the people can still interact with the old familiar institutions, even though it inwardly is rebuilt from the ground up. "
CVA_CTH_c8:0 "The Anti-Constitutionalist Decree" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c8_desc:0 "Some would have considered the Constitutionalists allies, but that was before the death of Zeshmunazash. They proved their true mettle then, and we have not forgotten. Yet at the same time, they are not a threat like the technocrats. Their party will be outlawed and they will be thrown in jail, but we will leave it at that."
CVA_CTH_c9:0 "A Bullet For The Fascists" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c9_desc:0 "When you are dealing with a disease, equivocating or waffling around will only hurt you even more. Fascism was born as the worst reaction to the revolution, and they shall be exterminated, lest their twisted ideology takes root once again."
CVA_CTH_c10:0 "A Bayonet For The Patricians" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c10_desc:0 "The elites have sat in their mansions and estates for centuries, preening mightily above the heads of the common worker. They think they can scramble to secure their position in the new order as well, but we wil lteach them the folly of their ways. "
CVA_CTH_c11:0 "Mass Property Re-Acquisition" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c11_desc:0 "The elites had built their tiny fiefdoms across Colthage, and unimaginable wealth had been gathered here. These great properties, built on the backs of the exploited, will be reclaimed by the people's state so that those who worked to build it may reap the fruits of their work. "
CVA_CTH_c12:0 "Restore Order In Hippone" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c12_desc:0 "The Starites have been allowed to run rampant for too long. With stability slowly returning in the heartland, we can now march east and show them that a bunch of jesters in gas masks are no match for the strength of the people!"
CVA_CTH_c13:0 "Restore The Hippone Territorial Fleet" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c13_desc:0 "The starites' rampage left our naval assets in the region beached and used for other purposes. Thankfully, the damage is not that severe. With sufficient work, we can restore this important part of our navy to its prime.  "
CVA_CTH_c14:0 "The Semblance Of Normalcy" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c14_desc:0 "It's come step by step, but news of fighting are getting rarer. Arrests and interrogations are getting more uncommon and the bureaucracy is back up and running. All of a sudden, it feels like it's over."
CVA_CTH_b1:0 "REvolutionary Conscription" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b1_desc:0 "Though the war is over, we are not safe yet, and if we are to ensure the integrity of our federation we must have an army up to the task. The shattered remnants of Colthage's army might well have what we're looking for. If we make sure to sift away ideologues and fanatics, many of them simply wish to fight for their home."
CVA_CTH_b2:0 "Military Worker Brigades" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b2_desc:0 "Our army consists of tens of thousands of able-bodied and highly organised zebras. While there is no war going on they would be better off assisting our rebuilding efforts. Not only will this aid recovery efforts, but it will also help those lacking faith in the revolutionary cause to build respect for the workers."
CVA_CTH_b3:0 "The Modern Liberation Army" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b3_desc:0 "Militias and guerillas might have been where we started, but we will need something more going ahead. War is an industry these days, and we must apply all our efforts towards industrialising our army. "
CVA_CTH_b4:0 "Basic Combat Roles" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b4_desc:0 "Not every zebra will serve the same purpose in battle. Some will shoot, others will dig, others will patch wounds and yet others will handle reconnaissance. This divison of martial labour will strengthen our forces immensely."
CVA_CTH_b5:0 "Alchemical Proliferation" #Sweet

CVA_CTH_2_a2:0 "Tackling The Famine"
CVA_CTH_2_a2_desc:0 "The disruption of civil authority across Colthage has broken the delicate balance established by the Colthaginian oligarchs.

CVA_CTH_2_a3:0 "Stick To The Plan"
CVA_CTH_2_a3_desc:0 "The plan of Kizil-Zeb was the comprehensive land reform plan that first spurred the Liberation Army of the East to arms after it was rejected by the Colthaginian government.

CVA_CTH_2_a4:0 "Repurpose The Karamane Plantations"
CVA_CTH_2_a4_desc:0 "The plantations of Karamane have long grown labour-intensive cash crops, which suited the oligarchs perfectly well when Colthage was a slave-based economy and labour was free.

CVA_CTH_2_a7:0 "Salvage The Industrial Sector"
CVA_CTH_2_a7_desc:0 "The civil war has decimated Colthaginian industry, with many factory workers either being conscripted or rioting against their bosses, and shelling reducing some factories to rubble.

Our schools must be places of freedom and questioning, with students choosing what subjects to pursue and punishments severely restricted."
CVA_CTH_2_a11:0 "Technocratic Guidance"
CVA_CTH_2_a11_desc:0 "The scientific clique may have been a tool of the Zarcaid regime, but they certainly knew how to run things. By following their guidance, we can rebuild our educational system in an orderly, tested manner, ensuring that our students know to respect their teachers and will be taught the proper way."
CVA_CTH_2_a12:0 "Maintain Academic Autonomy"
CVA_CTH_2_a12_desc:0 "While literacy, independence, and good citizenship are obviously political goals, the education system cannot be reduced to a political tool. Now that we have set up the basic structure of our academia, we will leave it alone, giving it subsdtantial discretion over its own budget and curricula and only intervening when necessary."
CVA_CTH_2_a13:0 "Horizontal Economic Planning"
CVA_CTH_2_a13_desc:0 "For generations, the oligarchs and the patricians have dictated to the citizens of colthage what they can do with their lives. What jobs they can work, what they can produce, how they can sell. No longer! No great government organ shall tell the people how to live their lives. Local economic issues shall be handled by the locals who shall form councils and unions to address their own issues."
CVA_CTH_2_a14:0 "The Right To Prosper"
CVA_CTH_2_a14_desc:0 "There is no reason a citizen of Zonicia should be in want because of factors outside of their control. Whether it be natural disaster, the death of a breadwinner, or any other such situation, the state has a duty to help them. Every citizen has the right to prosper."
CVA_CTH_2_b1:0 "From Bottom Up"
CVA_CTH_2_b1_desc:0 "From the top down, from the dubious elections to the slavery-based economy, Colthage was a republic but hardly a democracy. We must completely reorganize the Colthaginian political system from the bottom up, so that every creature will have a hoof in the life of their community and the direction of their country."
CVA_CTH_2_b2:0 "Participatory Democracy"
CVA_CTH_2_b2_desc:0 "The right to vote is a paltry thing. What is a right if it is not exercised, if it is not accompanied by educational, cultural and political institutions which let our people make meaningful political choices? We will enshrine democracy as not just a legal right, but a core principle of our society, and encourage every citizen to take an active hoof in the politics of their community."
CVA_CTH_2_b3:0 "Indigenous Autonomism"
CVA_CTH_2_b3_desc:0 "Just as monocultural agriculture drains the soil, the quest for cultural homogeneity drains a nation of its vitality, of its capacity for growth. Our lands are home to many indigenous and minority cultures, particularly within Coltva. We will ensure these indigenous cultures retain their autonomy and institutions, so that they may grow and develop rather than being subsumed into the majority."
CVA_CTH_2_b4:0 "Adaptational Socialism"
CVA_CTH_2_b4_desc:0 "We are not communists, that term has been used by authoritarians to destroy nations and oppress creatures around the world. But, we do see merit in socialist economic principles, especially as a way to rebuild after the chaos of the civil war. The bleeding months must end, and socialism will get us there."
CVA_CTH_2_b5:0 "The Governor Of Tefemanei"
CVA_CTH_2_b5_desc:0 "The Zarcid forces aren't down yet, yet it seems like their leadership is wavering.  The governor of Tefmanei, as the last high-ranking Zarcid leader left, has contacted the government and offered to negotiate for peace. The offer seems sincere, but the the idea of actually negotiating with the zarcids leaves a bitter taste in many zebras' mouths."
CVA_CTH_2_b6:0 "The Lion Of The West"
CVA_CTH_2_b6_desc:0 "There is a zebra who roams the land out west, running wild and free. Some call him a bandit, some call him a liberator, but he's always been an enemy of the enemy of ours. Zannido "The Bandolier" Zidon has been a powerful local force in Zur for years, and it might be worth bringing him on side. We just need to be careful of his reputation..."
CVA_CTH_2_b7:0 "The Convention Of Zamitha"
CVA_CTH_2_b7_desc:0 "It is time to end the chaos, a conference of the National Unity Front shall be called, a permanent agreement sorted out for how the government shall be run, and everyone shall sign. We shall govern in peace not war. We shall govern for prosperity, not for greed. We shall govern for the good of all, not for the good of the few."
CVA_CTH_2_b8:0 "Reform The Prefecture System"
CVA_CTH_2_b8_desc:0 "Communes are archaic and unpredictable. Even in this reformed system we wish to create, there is no room for "loudest voice" politics. The old prefectures shall be reinstated with modifications. There shall be governors and bureaucrats who shall work to protect the people at all times. After all it's their job."
CVA_CTH_2_b9:0 "For Everycreature, Everything"
CVA_CTH_2_b9_desc:0 "We cannot let the chaos of the past return, a balance must be found between the old order and the radical new world. Local government shall be emphasised at all levels, but they will still be responsible to Prefectures and their Prefects, who will moderate the local communes and administrations."
CVA_CTH_2_b10:0 "Enshrine Communal Autonomy"
CVA_CTH_2_b10_desc:0 "The communes established in the wake of the advance of the LAE are the purest expression of the freedom we wish to bring to all of Zonicia. The citizens have rose up and declared they want to govern themselves, and who are we to state the contrary. We have no need for tyrants above us, only comrades next to us."
CVA_CTH_2_b11:0 "Integrate The Ex-Patricians"
CVA_CTH_2_b11_desc:0 "With their forces shattered and the Governor of Tefamenei joining us, we can force our terms on the Patricians. They will be allowed to keep some of their political power, being integrated into the NUF as local representatives. This will hopefully strengthen our regional administrations."
CVA_CTH_2_b12:0 "Confederalise The Union"
CVA_CTH_2_b12_desc:0 ""
CVA_CTH_2_c1:0 "Fullblown Military Reorganization"
CVA_CTH_2_c1_desc:0 "Now that weare the government of all Zonicia and not just Coltva, our army will need major reorganization to grow into our new role. Most importantly, we will have to figure out what to do with the structures of the Colthaginian army with its patchworks of mercenaries, penal batallions, and private armies."
CVA_CTH_2_c2:0 "The Blacklist"
CVA_CTH_2_c2_desc:0 "it would be not only immoral, but foolish to trust the former loyalists of the Zarcaids to protect our federation. Many are little better than thugs, and had aspirations to rule as dictators. No. The rotten structure of the old Colthaginian army will be disbanded. The worst officers will be blacklisted, never allowed to pursue military work again."
CVA_CTH_2_c3:0 "Decentralised Recruitment"
CVA_CTH_2_c3_desc:0 "We should expand our recruitment practices in Coltva into all of Zonicia, setting up recruitment centers in the most distant villages to ensure all communities do their part in defending our lands."
CVA_CTH_2_c4:0 "Formalise Regional Defence Committees"
CVA_CTH_2_c4_desc:0 "The defense of the nation can only be carried out by those who care for the nation. In addition to the overal military command structure, each prefecture will have a Defense Committee made up of army officials and citizen leaders, who in the event of invasion of our homeland shall coordinate resistance in the region. They may take our lives, but they can never take our freedom!"
CVA_CTH_2_c5:0 "Prioritise Military Healthcare Implementation"
CVA_CTH_2_c5_desc:0 "The second civil war saw horriffic casualties on both sides, both from wounds and from infections. Many of those deaths were preventable, had our medical corps been better equipped and trained. We will focus our efforts on improving this vital part of our army, acquiring the latest antibiotics and increasing the length and quality of medic training to ensure we save every life we can."
CVA_CTH_2_c6:0 "Reform The Colthaginian Artillery Corps"
CVA_CTH_2_c6_desc:0 "Artillery is essential to a well-functioning army. While our own use of artillery was quite simple, the Colthaginians developed far more advanced ballistics tables and doctrines. We should use these, and make our own artillery corps as effective as theirs once were."
CVA_CTH_2_c7:0 "Rehabilitate The General Staff"
CVA_CTH_2_c7_desc:0 "Conducting an ideologically-motivated purge would be a waste of valuable soldiers and expertise. The Colthaginian army were merely doing their duty when fighting us, as we did our duty when we defeated them. Better to move forward together, combine our talents and knowledge, and forge a stronger army than we could create alone."
CVA_CTH_2_c8:0 "The Main Battle Rifle Debate"
CVA_CTH_2_c8_desc:0 "Once again, we are an army without a single standard service rifle. While the Garcano has served us well, it is beginning to show its age, and the Colthaginian batallions used their own rifles. We should bring together officers, military scientists and arms manufacturers to decide on a new rifle."
CVA_CTH_2_c9:0 "The Rapid Response Corps"
CVA_CTH_2_c9_desc:0 "Building a corps of motorized riflezebras will allow us to respond more quickly to a changing battlefield, as well as to provide rapid emergency assistance in the case of natural disastres. These motorized units will also prove valuable in exploiting breakthroughs made by our chargers."
CVA_CTH_2_c10:0 "Prioritise Rebuilding The Army Industry"
CVA_CTH_2_c10_desc:0 "The Zarcaid military-industrial complex must be rebuilt, albeit now out of the hooves of corrupt oligarchs. Refurbishing theses arms factories will allow us to equip a new army, befitting the size of our federation and the strength of our neighbours."
CVA_CTH_2_c11:0 "Pardon Select Colthaginian Officers"
CVA_CTH_2_c11_desc:0 "Some of Colthage's best officers languish in jail for crimes committed in defence of the Zarcaid regime. But many of those crimes were not evevn illegal at the time, and more importantly there are many among them who have expressed repentence and possess invaluable skills. A few paroles, a few pardons, and we can tap into the vast talent pools currently being wasted."
CVA_CTH_2_c12:0 "Enshrine Operational Autonomy"
CVA_CTH_2_c12_desc:0 "How our military operates cannot be allowed to be dictated from general staff rooms and conference halls. It is the commanders on the ground who know how to fight the best. Our generals shall get them where they need to go, then the soldiers themselves shall lead us to victory."
CVA_CTH_2_c13:0 "The National Defence Council"
CVA_CTH_2_c13_desc:0 "A council of our best commanders shall form the backbone of all policy to do with the military. Recruitment, tactics, grand strategy, all policies related to the army shall be handled by this National Defense Council. And within its walls, the safety of all Colthage shall be ensured."
CVA_CTH_2_c14:0 "The Revolutionary General Staff"
CVA_CTH_2_c14_desc:0 "Regardless of the nature of our revolution on the civilian front, we need to face reality. Wars cannot be fought by democratic elections, we need to run our army like a modern nation state. A strict command hierarchy and an emphasis on modern tactics and a war of movement will secure our nation's future."

colthaginian_federation.1.d:0 "The sun was too bright, the crowd too loud, and the gentle breeze did nothing to stop her headache. Zarishat took a deep breath as she held onto the pulpit, feeling her mouth water weirdly and a wave of nausea came over her. At least, her quickly covering her mouth and looking down probably came across as grief, and she swallowed to push the nausea down.\n\n"Fellow comrades of the revolution," she began, her voice raspy from the night before. "I never expected to be standing here before you today. This was meant to be my brother's moment... like everything else in life. He always stood there, shining like he was so much better than everyone else and-and we are all left weeping over his death." It was an exertion to correct herself, as all she wanted to do was to puke bile all over that self-righteous, arrogant pig she had endured her entire life. Getting back on topic, she continued with more fervor.\n\n"But I promise you, comrades of the struggle, that we are not stopping here. We are not quitting the struggle, indeed we have only begun! The revolution marches forward, and we shall complete my brother's labours! We shall punish those who ended his life, as we shall bring justice down upon those who have exploited and oppressed us for so long! The revolution lives!" She finished, actually managing to cry out and raise one hoof up to the air and provoke a thunderous response from the onlookers. It all kept going for way too long, and when she finally got off the stage she shook her head in exhaustion.\n\nShe had a chance right now, a chance unlike anything she'd ever imagined possible. With her brother out of the picture, she was the one they looked to for leadership, and if she didn't seize this opportunity, she'd never see anything like it again. Who'd have thought the best thing her brother could do for her was to die..."

His army is deeply dug in across the hilly region, and attempts to dislodge them have already failed. If we are to stop that zebra, it'll take resources we don't have right now."

Couldn't they just have run out and started lynching zebras left and right, and then they could rein in the worst excesses? No, apparently not. It seemed like she had to take charge even here. \n\nIn Coltva, they had worked slowly and steadily, but now it would all come crashing down at once not the least thanks to the vicious war that had brought them here. Now, they would have to deal with their enemies all at once, and she really didn't care much for dealing with this. No matter the call, she'd piss important zebras off.\n\nThey had to be firm, that much she understood, but going after the technocrats alone wouldn't do it. The zebras under her wanted blood, and the constitutionalists hadn't done themselves any favour. Maybe it'd be for the best to target them as well, and truly bring the wrath of the revolution and all that down on their heads? It'd cause a lot of unrest, but it'd give her army what they wanted.

She'd had this position fall onto her out of sheer luck, but either she stopped now, or she'd slip up and share her brother's fate sooner or later.\n\nThat was why she stood by the sink, pouring out every last bottle of alcohol she had, making sure to not breathe through her nose so the smell wouldn't tempt her. How long had she lasted before? A week maybe, two at one point. It was now or never though, and she grimaced as she finished pouring out the last bottle and put it on the counter. Pouring herself a mug of tea, she sipped it and instantly felt the desire to pour in some liquor as well.

He preferred to be guided by his grandmother's last words; "I'd rather hear once of your kindness, than a thousand times of your wealth".

Yet, he had submitted to their Kizil-Zeb plan, believing sincerely that it was the best way to keep peace, and that from his concession they all could move forward together.\n\nYet, it had become clear to him that he had been alone in that thought. While at first he had thought things would get better, those hopes were dashed as he looked down on the letter, which coldly informed him that he had one week to depart his property with only what he could carry, as the land he occupied was now considered property of the federation. He read it over and over, trying to comprehend what was going on. This couldn't be right, this wasn't what was meant to happen. He had cooperated, hadn't he?

At least the classes would be the same boring ones they had been before the war, with the same boring classmates.\n\nAs he entered and found a place, he looked forward to slipping down into the familiar miasma of tedium, only to be surprised as the lecturer began by telling them that the curriculum had been revised, and that in addition they would be assigned a new bloc of classes.

Still sore, and had been for three day now. All he had done was try to argue with the guards that his bunkmate was sick and couldn't work as hard as they wanted. That, apparently, made him deserve the baton to them. His bunkmate wasn't looking too cheery either.

At first their parents had hurried them inside when the soldiers had poured out, but when it had turned out the soldiers had come to help rebuild the destroyed mill, most of them had snuck outside to look at the vehicle. It was huge, bigger than anything they'd seen before!!\n\nOne of the soldiers that were unloading construction materials from it glanced at them and grinned. "D'you like it? This thing can carry four tonnes if needed. We could pack all of you AND your parents onto this thing, no problem." A small murmur of awe came from the foals at this. None of them had even heard of a thing like that before.\n\n"Can you put an entire house on it?" one of the foals asked and the soldier furrowed his brow for a second before nodding.\n\n"Sure can, probably."\n\n"Can you put the entire VILLAGE in it?!" another foal asked eagerly and the soldier shook his head.\n\n"Nah, the village is too big. It'd be wobbly and end up falling off." As he spoke, he used his hooves to demonstrate. The foals all nodded among themselves. That made sense. The soldier, meanwhile, scratched his cheek absently. "Hey... if you help us unload this truck, I'll see if we can give you a ride. Deal?" He had barely finished the sentence before the foals were clamouring over the wall to help out."

At least he didn't look furious, she didn't want to get drenched in his spit. Instead he looked despondent, sighing as he wiped his forehead.\n\n"I understand what is going on here, and I do not want to be presumptive or dismissive... but why in Zaal's name is the federation building a secret police?"\n\n"I have no idea what you are speaking of, good Ozid." Zarishat sat calmly behind her desk, looking at him and wondered if he was about to start crying.\n\n"I also understand that secrecy is how these things are done, but I beg you, please reconsider! What you are building will not aid the revolution, it will choke it! A secret police will not inspire confidence, but fear. It will create an unaccountable shadow weapon that can be wielded with impunity by whoever controls it! Our authority is supposed to come from the will of the people, not the threat of being vanished in the night. This is the exact same kind of weapon that would have been used to chase us down back in Coltva, and even if it fulfils its purpose well initially, sooner or later it will be nothing but an instrument of repression, of tyranny, of authoritarianism! This is not what the revolution was meant to be!"\n\n"Thank you Ozid, I will take what you say under consideration. Now if you don't mind..." Zarishat said flatly, watching him deflate even more in his chair. After a while, he got up and nodded his head toward her before leaving. As the door closed, she rolled her eyes."

"The most important thing you must know about this weapon is that it is semi-automatic! This means that it does not need reloading after you fire it."\n\nPutting the rifle down on the table, he took up the old familiar rifle they were used to, turning around and firing five shots downrange. Every shot was followed by the re-chambering movement they all knew like the back of their hooves, and the sergeant did it with expert speed and control. After finishing, he put the old rifle down, picking up the new and raising it. What followed left them all taken aback, as the sergeant just squeezed the trigger over and over, sending eight bullets flying downrange so quickly that it almost sounded like a machine gun. When he turned back, more than one soldier was gawking, and a couple were giddy at the idea of getting to try that new weapon.\n\n"Listen," the sergeant continued. "This weapon will fire much faster than any of you can re-acquire your target. When you fire this, you do NOT fire as fast as I just did. Fire one shot at a time, and re-acquire your target for every shot, is that clear!?""

"I'm not seeing anything about negotiations or possible concessions to offer." She let the question hang in the air and Zarishat leaned back.\n\n"That's because we're not going to negotiate. We're at a position to secure our control over the nation fully, and I'm not going to throw that away to play nice with the reactionaries. Anycreature that's still fighting us has proven what their goals are, so offering them a way out will only leave us with future enemies. Track down our enemies and kill them all, there's not going to be any room for niceties now. Actually, no, pretend to accept surrender, but then kill them in secret. If they believe there's a way out, that'll make it easier I suppose."\n\n"How savage." Monzano chuckled as she listened to the instructions. "I'll wrap this all up nicely and present it to the generals tomorrow. If there's no issues, we'll be able to start the campaign within a week." Saluting, she departed the office and left Zarishat to spin around in her chair and look out of the window.\n\nShe wondered how many groups that were more or less in the situation they'd been in back in Coltva; outnumbered and outgunned, yet grimly determined. Well, she knew how to deal with that kind of rebels; no mercy, no respite, just hunt them like dogs until they fell down from exhaustion.

Her entire body was buzzing with glee and pride in this moment, and she smiled widely to herself. Her success was sweeter than any cider she'd ever tasted, and she felt how she finally was coming out of the shadow she'd been in her all her life.\n\nThat damn brother of hers was finally the one being eclipsed. No longer was she "the sister of Zeshmunazash", she was Zarishat, and she was carving out her legacy, her path. Her brother's naive nonsense was finally left in the ditch where it belonged, and he would fade to be a historical curiosity. As for her...\n\n"Today we take a grand step forward, bringing the revolution into a new phase not seen ever before! Casting aside notions of Coltvans or Colthaginians, we instead rise to become something greater! We are all birthed from the same ancient stock, one divided a long time ago, yet which now will be reunited under a new power, under the Zonician Sovereign Socialist Federation!" On cue, the banners unfurled behind her to display the new banners of the ZSSF.\n\nNow it was complete. Now the last bits of her brother's legacy was gone and she, the Red Sufrit, stood on top of the world. As the crowds applauded and cheered, she waved her hoof at them. At last, she was truly happy."

Some would say they were even a tad addicting. At least enough so to put up with the process of getting through the darn security perimeter.\n\nAfter fumbling with his ID card within his coat, intentionally oversized to obscure his appearance and give him privacy, Zazarit gave it to the OARA guard who let him through into the Arabian sector. Buildings in the Sa'addle style replaced the Zonician realist structures, and horses in fancy robes contrasted the loyal OARA who stood guard. Anyone in here either had it in with Zarishat, or wasn't going to be here much longer.\n\nWeaving his way through the streets, Zazarit found his location, a sand brick building with purple cloth accenting the doorway. Entering inside, he trotted up a small flight of stairs before being hit with a wave of intoxicating smoke. On a cushion of purple satin in front of him was the Emir of Al'Nadieia, surrounded by a collection of three "companions," two mares and a stallion, wearing veils of the same purple.\n\n"Ah, my friend, welcome, have a seat!" the Emir said. Zazarit took him up on the offer, sitting down on a near-identical cushion on his side of the room, after which he was immediately approached by another stallion carrying a glass container full of smoke with a tube attached. Handing it to Zazarit, he took a puff and thanked the worker, who winked at him in return.\n\nTurning back to the Emir, Zazarit said, "I understand you wanted to talk about the deal? Has there been a change of plans? You know the party doesn't like surprises."\n\n"No, no, I just wanted to review the details one last time, Mr. Zazarit," the Emir said with a small smile. "Or should I call you Commissar? And plus, you're a fun stallion to be with! While most of your "comrades" are uptight when we talk, you know how to relax, to enjoy yourself."\n\nZazarit chuckled. "Well then, let's hammer it out as agreed. You get that contract from the party for the new governor's mansion. You reimburse the "party" for around half, and I get you exclusive rights to the coffee trade from the villages around Zebinop."\n\n"Everything does seem to be in order," the Arabian said, nodding slowly. "Tell you what. You've been such a good partner that I'll offer you something extra." He reached over and pulled back a curtain, giving a view of the rest of his "companion" employees.

Only a year ago, when she still drank, it would have given her a bleating headache and one hell of a temper, but she was beyond that now. Fully sober and entirely centered on what she was about to do. She had to suppress a chuckle. This was a memorial, after all, a memorial to her "holier-than-thou" brother and his legacy of reform and growth. But look where he was now. Down in the dirt, out of her mane, and not here to complain about all the changes she was making.\n\nIt took her a while to think of how to best honor him, but with all the economic reforms she was making, Zarishat started to savor just how much he would despise her for it. His revolution built on communal ownership and devolution of property, swiped out of his grasp by the sister he could never appreciate. Then, it had hit her like lightning.\n\nSpeaking clearly into the microphone, Zarishat began her speech, "Citizens of Zonicia! Look how far we have come! From the days of the revolution, we are more prosperous and more enriched, we are more educated in the ways of the revolution, and we stand above the slavers and masters that once held us down! But we can not forget what we have lost, my brave brother, Zeshmunazash, who died for our freedom to be won." Zarishat spoke about her brother through gritted teeth, her speech included a section praising specific things he had done, but seeing how she could barely stammer out calling him "brave," she decided it would be best to toss it.\n\n"Thus, I have come to declare the opening of a new memorial to his memory, a symbol of our economic progress, the new Kizil-Zeb foreign consulate!" Behind her, a red cloth fell, revealing the new titan of a building. The red hammer of the revolution towering imposingly above the entrance, interlocked not with a horseshoe, but instead a golden coin, a perversion of everything that scumbag of a brother stood for. Zarishat knew she couldn't call her new stock exchange what it was, but just knowing the true purpose of the beacon of moneymaking that stood in front of her gave her a warm feeling of joy, as well as heaps of irony."

"So, where to now then, you wonder," he told his gathered advisors. They'd been on his case about what he planned to do now all day. Ozid, Zala, even Zarishat, all had been asking. "I guess we'll just institute a dictatorship. Can start purging the constitutionalists, mass execute the patricians, rob the nation blind, set fire to the jungles and then build a giant diamond statue of myself, unfurl my wings and fly off into space."

Zala was pounding his hoof into the desk to accentuate his point and spoke with volume and zeal both. As Ozid spoke up, his soft voice stood in sharp contrast to the Zala's.\n\n"While you are right, we need to remember its purpose. It is a land reform meant to alleviate the plight of the farmers, nothing more. The urban poor are better helped by new programs focusing on them, not trying to apply the Kizil-Zeb to things it was never meant for. It being a compromise is a strength, not a weakness, because we've already implemented it and seen that it works.

"As noble as the sentiment expressed is," the economist began. "I fear it may be overambitious at this time. The system is new to most farmers in the region, and we have pressing concerns to deal with here and now. Reviewing the matter with General Monzano, I would say that the best solution would be to parcel out the land to the farmers that already know how to use the land and offer them profitable contracts to get us bananas, and as many as they can."\n\n"Do we need to commit fully to either?" Jezabzella asked. "Why not simply set aside most of the area for the cooperatives, but allow private plantations to an extent?"\n\n"Not the least since they could serve as trial plantations for local initiatives or experiments," Ozid agreed.

"If the issue is starvation, give it to those most at risk, and let us avoid our people dying by us valuing 'the economy' over their lives. Is that not an obvious solution?"\n\n"Yes yes, you're very cute," Zarishat drawled. Her bleary eyes and raspy voice spoke clearly of what she had been doing last night.

"Oh, Zarishat dear, did you have any alternatives? Perhaps the wine helped you think of something?"\n\nZarishat's gaze could have melted stone, and Jezabzella's smile was angelic. Instead of exploding, however, she continued. "Use the damn grain to get those who still plan to fight to sit down and behave. Some provinces are hotbeds of resistance, and if we slip them some extra food they'll calm down and we'll stabilise the region. Economy or lives won't matter if we collapse when attacked."\n\n"Okay we'll end for the day," Zeshmunazash sighed.

Now though, he wanted to savour it and ate with one foreleg wrapped around the bowl as if to protect it.\n\n"Is it good?" a voice asked and he looked up, seeing one of the zebras that were running the soup kitchen that had fed him had come up to him. He nodded and took another bite. "Mind if I sit?" The zebra, a large, beefy stallion, nodded towards the chair next to his and he hesitated for a second before shrugging. The zebra slipped down onto the chair and continued asking him questions. "You are a veteran, right? Do you have a place to stay?" He shook his head.\n\n"I'm sleep'n under a bridg'. Can't go 'nywher' else." He didn't like talking. Ever since the grenade he slurred when he spoke. All he wanted was to eat and at least fall asleep with a full stomach. He had little more to hope for these days. At least the zebra was quiet for a few seconds now.\n\n"Did you know they're opening a spice processing plant in the city?" he asked, "They've said that veterans are getting dibs on work there, no matter what side you fought for. Would you like me to put in a word for you?" The question left him stopping mid bite. He put down the spoon as he stared down into the stew, not quite daring to believe what he had heard.\n\n"I jus' wan'ed food... "I don'... you don'." He shook his head. This wasn't really happening, was it? He was supposed to have lost everything, condemned to pass away in some back alley as a broken husk of a zebra. He'd almost managed to let go of hope that things would become better. "Yes please," he eventually managed to whisper."

colthaginian_federation_2.8.d:0 "The mood was tense, almost like a piano wire, as the two groups of zebras - the left side in worker's clothes and the other side in suits - stared each other down as a burly zebra on the left was giving the other side a vicious dressing down. "...and you try to tell us that slaving away in the factory is the same whether it's in the middle of the night, or it's daytime? I'm coming home to a kid that's already off for school, and by the time he's back, I'm out the door to go back here! If that's how it's going to be, you'll be paying more for it, or you can forget any worker taking your night shifts!"\n\n"The work is the exact same, and you are paid for the work you do." One of the suit-wearing zebras on the other side snapped back. "You are free to leave and find employment elsewhere if that is not acceptable."\n\n"So you can find those desperate enough to take the shifts without extra compensation, and who you can dismiss without a question when they don't accept being treated like animals?!" The burly zebra stopped now as a mare beside him put a hoof on his shoulder he fell quiet, letting her take over.\n\n"The issue here is not the nature of the job, it's the strain it puts on the workers. As he says, zebras are not able to be with their families, they spend their lives toiling away in the night and when the sun comes, they'll be fast asleep. You're out of synch with most of society when you're on the night shift, it's not something you can for long. You could just as well be stuck on a deserted island for how much time you can spend with friends and family."\n\nThe suit-wearing zebra was close to throwing up his hooves and calling it quits. One thing after another, these workers were never happy. Still, he knew that if he did, they'd go on strike. With the current government, they'd be out of luck with getting police help, and it'd all be down to who could outlast the other. How he missed the good old days..."

I am not too well versed in the Liberation Army's ranks."\n\n"You really aren't, because if you were you'd know I prefer to being called by my name." Zeshmunazash told him. As he spoke, he studied the leader of the remnant technocrat forces. This was who Zala and Ozid both had been up in arms about him going to see? Zorrzel looked like the zebra equivalent of a dusty typewriter. "As for the other thing; I've taken the controversial route most of my life. It was to be expected. More important is what you are willing to offer for this controversy." Taking of his glasses and polishing them with a slow sigh, Zorrzel nodded in response to the question.\n\n"That would indeed be the pertinent issue, would it not? Very well then, as it seems that the gods have decided to place me in the unfortunate position of being the last leader of the Zarcid forces I... well my surrender should obviously be a foregone conclusion, but in addition to that I wish to offer my services to your National Unity Front, in whatever capacity I might be useful."\n\n"What are your terms?" Zeshmunazash asked. Forget dusty typewriter, he appeared more like some plant that had been taken out of the archives where he belonged, and would wilt utterly unless brought back into the musty darkness.\n\n"Oh, no terms at all. I have no real bargaining power at the moment, and I am left throwing myself at your hooves to plead for mercy even though I know that it'll cause a stir in your own ranks.\n\n"Eh, as I said I've always gone for the controversial option," Zeshmunazash smirked as he reached out a hoof to Zorrzel. "I accept your surrender, and welcome aboard.""

"I mean we've never met him, maybe he'll be the type of share a drink with?" Noticing how this bite of humor didn't improve Ozid's mood, Zesh sighed and continued, "This is just a meeting. I am not agreeing to anything by just showing up. I want to meet this so-called "Lion of the West." He may be a bandit, but he's been fighting the Colthaginians for years. Also, he's apparently been planning on some sort of land reform like the plan of Kizil-Zeb for years. I want to see what he has to say."\n\nOzid sat in one of the chairs nearby, and crossed his hooves. "Zeshmunazash, you are making a mistake. He could have you killed for Za'al's sake!" Zeshmunazash sat down beside him, "I am going with a bodyguard, of course. We've agreed to a meeting in a house with just the two of us, no weapons." "He's a bloody bandit!" Ozid exclaimed, "You think he'll listen to deals!"\n\nZeshmunazash rose, and put his hoof on his distressed friend's shoulder, "If he is a bandit, he may not."

colthaginian_federation_2.11.d:0 "Approaching the compound was more stressful than Zeshmunazash thought it would be. Earlier, he had believed himself resigned to his fate, believing that this bandit had fought for a good cause. Now, it was a bit more nerve-wracking. Seeing the building in which they were to meet, he was confused. It was just a farmhouse, he had expected either a fancier building or some shack for them to meet. But this was a family farm, as his back home! Entering, he was hit with a pungent aroma. Was that... apples? \n\n"Ey, comrade! Over here!" Zeshmunazash turned to the noise, and looking to his left, he saw a truly shocking sight. A zebra lounged back in a rocking chair, a full mustache, and held what looked like a liquor bottle. "Don't just stand there, friend, sit, sit!" As Zeshmunazash began to step towards the table, the zebra flashed a smile at him and said, "Come on, I don't bite... often." before chuckling lightly. \n\nAs Zeshmunazash sat, an old female zebra entered the room from the side carrying a pie, the source of the apple smell. Becoming suddenly stiff, Zeshmunazash soon saw the old woman was not a fighter. Turning to the zebra, he said sarcastically, "Zidon, I thought we agreed on no other soldiers in the room." Zidon turned back to him and chuckled, "My dear friend, this isn't one of my soldiers. This is-" "I mean the pie does look lethally good," Zesh interrupted. Staring at him for a second, Zidon continued, "This is Mama Manzana, a charity worker. She is letting me use her farmhouse for our get-together. That's all." Smiling again, Zidon pushed a plate towards Zeshmunazash as well as a glass. "Drink, eat! We are meant to be friends here, no?" He then bent down beside him and picked up a thatch farmer's hat, placing it on his head, "I hope you didn't think this would be one of those boring political conferences." Zeshmunazash smiled, "I like your style Zidon. So tell me, why is a fighter like you talking to a politician like me. You revolted for years. Are you sure you're ready to put down the rifle?"\n\nZidon thought for a moment, then spoke, "Why would I fight when what I have fought for is already here? I've been fighting for years for my comrades and friends to get a fair shot in life. To work their land and live happy, content lives, and look where we as a nation are now! The oligarchs are gone, and I've read your plans many times. I really couldn't ask for more for the zebras of this land! So when you approached me, I was thrilled that I would get the chance to meet you. I don't want to fight anymore. I want to live."\n\nZeshmunazash smiled wide now, "Well, friend, let's get down to business first. Then, I'll gladly take you up on the drinks and pie." Zidon laughed loudly and fully, "Bussiness first kind of zebra then? Alright, I can work with that. But I always open deals with a toast, so..." Filling the small glass with some of the amber liquid from his bottle, he pushed it back to Zeshmunazash, "A toast, to friendship.""

colthaginian_federation_2.13.d:0 "The Zonician Congress opened once again with the strike of a gavel and the rousing cheers of its delegates. Today on the agenda, specific famine relief measures in Zam'al and industrial development in Trotkat. The delegates proceeded around, chatting with one another and trying to hammer out provisions between the factions of the Congress. Everything flowed as usual in the halls of power, but normal is boring. Someone needs to shake things up a little. I think today, that someone will be me.\n\nZannido Zidon watched on from the upper balcony of the hall, drawing many curious glances from other citizens who had come to see the government work. He was quite the odd look, dressed in a nice suit with slicked-back hair, but still wearing his characteristic bandolier, without ammo, of course. He had arrived late, having to deal with some issues at home before he could make the trip, and had decided to watch the delegates work a bit first. After picking out Zeshmunazash in the crowd, Zidon got a sense of how these zebras played politics. "Well, time to get to work." he said to himself, "I can love the players and still hate the game."\n\nExiting the balcony, he made his way to the congress floor. Handing his bandolier to the security guard, he opened the doors to the chamber with a smile, drawing the attention of a few delegates nearby. His striking purple eyes drawing glances as he danced around the room, talking up the various representatives. Eventually, the speaker called the chamber to order, it was time to take a vote on the issues at hand.\n\nWatching him from the other side of the room, Zeshmunazash smiled as he went to take his seat next to Ozid. "See, I told you this would work! He's a natural politician." Ozid shook his head, "that's what I'm afraid of as well. Who knows what type of measures he'll support!" Zeshmunazash chuckled and shook his head before he felt a tap on his shoulder, turning around to see the well-dressed Zidon; the zebra said to him, "Hey, Mr. Big Shot, mind if I sit with you?" Zeshmunazash nodded, and Zidon took his seat as a member of the Orthodox faction of the congress."

It really was quite stunning how fast so many of the patricians went from contempt to terror at the Liberation Army's successes."\n\n"Well, they could have taken us seriously earlier on. That would have avoided some conflict. And you would be?" Monzano asked, looking the zebra over. He definitely was a patrician, relatively young, and she glanced to Azizelquart to see if he had anything to say.\n\n"Hiram Zerranid," the zebra introduced himself. "Formerly of Hippone. With the recent changes, I decided that my talents might be better spent aiding the National Unity Front. When I heard that mister Zahummid had found kindred spirits here, it seemed like I had found my people. And I presume you would be Zarishat Zeirutid?" He asked Zarishat, who had been sitting further away, watching the newcomer.\n\n"Great, here comes the parade of suck-ups," Zarishat responded. "I don't know who you are, and I could not care less. Tell us what you can do for us or leave."\n\n"Well, I am a writer and linguist of some renown, served as an advisor to the Zarcid regime..." Hiram took the comment in stride, explaining his credentials as Azizelquart leaned in to Monzano to whisper."\n\n"Truth be told, he's bit of an oddball.

As armies marched across the world and as kings decreed one thing after another, precious few stopped to ask 'Is this what everycreature wants? Do I truly have the right to let my glut for power trample all over everycreature?'." Zeshmunazash looked out across the gathered crowd as he spoke, wondering to himself what stories were among the zebras gathered to hear him speak. How many here hated him? How many feared him? He didn't know.\n\n"Though I know some will scoff at my words, the intent of the Liberation Army is the same as it always has been. We want to see the average zebra safe from the predations of those who could crush them, and to build a society where immense wealth does not offer license to brutalise and exploit the common zebra. We want a society where the common zebra participates and has a voice, a true voice and not the vain hope that a distant senator or patrician will take pity on them. And yet have we not gathered power under us, you ask. Have we not become rulers in our own right, who now stand atop Colthage?" He smiled wryly as he looked around at the crowd, seeing how they all looked to him, many of them seemingly wondering where he was going with this.\n\n"The truth is that we do not desire Colthaginian, or Coltvan, or anyzebra's dominion.

CVA_ZESHMUNAZASH_ZEIRUTID_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 5th of Janurary, 964 in Kizil-Zeb\n\nBorn to a family of well-off farmers, Zeshmunazash Zeirutid seemed to many to be destined for greatness. A highly intelligent and charismatic young zebra, he excelled in school and could have risen high, maybe even raise the Zeirutid family up among the patricians. It could have happened, were it not for his persistent and uncompromising need for fairness.\n\nHis parents had instilled in him a belief in helping your neighbours, and when local landlords began to seize the farmlands in the region, Zeshmunazash were among those who protested the seizures. As 'legal' as they might be, all he saw was a distant senate who did not listen to its people, and let greedy landowners run roughshod over them. As it turned out, the landowners had enough power to not only have the protests violently dispersed, but also brand the organisers as criminals. At eighteen years of age, Zeshmunazash became an outlaw, and fled into the wilds. Harsh action provokes a strong reaction, however, and Zeshmunazash became determined to bring down the corrupt landlords with whatever means necessary.\n\nThough there may be strong similarities between him and figures like Steel Stallion and Filip Redglad, Zeshmunazash has never quite bought into the mainstream socialist ideas, and instead has created his own brand of the revolution. He still believes Colthage can be saved, but not as long as the Zarcids hold sway, and not as long as the elites are allowed to do as they please. He did not want to become an outlaw, and he did not want to be a leader, but that is the price to pay so that his fellow farmers can grow their crops without fear of being driven from their homes, then he'll happily pay it.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Sesek"

### IDEAS ###

ROC_stoicism:0 "Rockville Stoicism"
ROC_stoicism_desc:0 "Those who admire the rock farmers of the Southwest speak of them as the embodiments of the elements of loyalty and honesty: solemn, blunt, and disciplined. Others, the types who wouldn't be caught dead venturing into a Rockville farm or spending a day in a Providential gathering, see them as apathetic, harsh, sullen, and drearily depressing. Rockville ponies will fight to their last gasp to defend their homes, their farms, and their families, and preserve what remains of their idyllic way of life.\n\nThey may not smile or laugh all that often, but one should never make the mistake of believing this means they do not love their fellow ponies above all else."

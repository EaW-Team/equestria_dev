#### FOCUS

EYR_fifth_onslaught:0 "Пятое нападение"
EYR_fifth_onslaught_desc:0 "Некоторые надёжные источники подтвердили наши худшие опасения. Самозванный герцог Винсент Эри готовит очередную атаку на своего законного сюзерена. Истинный правитель Верении должен сплотить своих солдат, усилить оборону и подготовить свой народ. Дом Эйри не склонится перед мятежниками и бунтарями."
EYR_sudden_death:0 "Неожиданная смерть"
EYR_sudden_death_desc:0 "Внезапная вспышка болезни унесла жизнь капитана Отто фон Грифслейна, почётного члена веренийской стражи. И хотя он так и не смог выйти из патовой ситуации, его навыки и стойкость всё же смогли обеспечить надлежащий уровень прочности линии обороны Аранти. Необходимо будет выбрать нового капитана-стража, а пока что герцог попросил объявить день траура."
EYR_take_control:0 "Взять судьбу в своих когти"
EYR_take_control_desc:0 "Мы должны разорвать этот порочный цикл войны. Хватит с нас роли обороняющихся в игре Винсента. Если мы хотим что-то изменить, то должны первыми перейти в наступление!"

EYR_empower_prelature:0 "Сотрудничать с прелатурой"
EYR_empower_prelature_desc:0 "Те, кто утверждают будто прелатура находится в тайном сговоре с иностранцами в ущерб Верении, явно не знают о чём говорят. И пусть дезертирство рыцарей-паладинов много лет назад было поистине предательским, оставшиеся силы явно доказали свою преданность. Только с их помощью мы можем положить конец борьбе."
EYR_empower_merchants:0 "Сотрудничать с средним классом"
EYR_empower_merchants_desc:0 "После республиканской революции мы наложили серьёзные ограничения на торговлю. Объективно, это сковывает нашу экономику и не даёт стране развиваться. И хоть это не снимает вины за восстание, нам стоит предоставить им чуть больше автономии в обмен на поддержку."
EYR_invite_foreigners:0 "Пригласить иностранных инструкторов"
EYR_invite_foreigners_desc:0 "Будем честны: наша армия далеко не идеальна. Постоянные битвы выкосили большинство лучших солдат, а снаряжение за долгие годы истрепалось. Если мы хотим получить преимущество над врагом, нам необходимо  обратиться к другим странам за помощью."
EYR_overrule_hof:0 "Ты или с герцогом или против него"
EYR_overrule_hof_desc:0 "Пришло время для более... решительных действий. Мы уберём любых грифонов, которые публично призывают к миру. Казним всех благородных, кто не согласен с герцогом. Мы все сплотимся против повстанцев или же умрём."
EYR_press_paladins_into_service:0 "Возвращение рыцарей-паладинов"
EYR_press_paladins_into_service_desc:0 "После известий о смерти прошлого герцога, большинство рыцарей-паладинов присоединились к восстанию Винсента. Оставшиеся же сохранили свою верность прелатуре, поддерживая нейтралитет для защиты священных мест. Если мы сможем доказать нашу решимость рыцарям в храмах, то они, возможно, присоединяться к Иовину в его стремлении покончить с войной."
EYR_deal_with_flowena:0 "Тайная сделка с Фловеной"
EYR_deal_with_flowena_desc:0 "Располагаясь неподалёку от земель Дома Эри, Фловена может многое как выиграть, так и потерять в войне. Возможно, она захочет разделить трофейное золото и вооружение, или даже заключить союз? Нам стоит связаться с ними и предложить сделку."
EYR_fuck_off_vincent:0 "Восстановление законного порядка"
EYR_fuck_off_vincent_desc:0 "Винсент Эри всего лишь жалкий голубь, недостойный править и малейшим клочком земли, не говоря о Верении целиком. И вся сила, которой он бахвалится, неминуемо сломается о наши крепости и доблестных защитников. Песня войны вновь зазвучит в Верении, но на этот раз мы выйдем победителями вневсяких сомнений."
EYR_new_captain:0 "Умиротворить благородных"
EYR_new_captain_desc:0 "Какой бы несвоевременной не была смерть капитана-стража Отто, его пост не должен пустовать. Войска Винсента пересекают реку уже во время наших разговоров. Отчаянные времена требуют отчаянных мер, поэтому нам стоит начать сотрудничать с более... грязнокровной частью благородных."
EYR_convene_court:0 "Поспешная встреча"
EYR_convene_court_desc:0 "Быстрее! Созывайте совет! Мы не может позволить себе отдых перед угрозой вторжения. Все сферы жизни в стране должны быть готовы, и если мы проигнорируем даже малейшую возможность, то проиграем войну. Мы должны соответствующе спланировать наши действия на следующие месяцы."
EYR_the_yearly_obligations:0 "Пушки, броня, идолы"
EYR_the_yearly_obligations_desc:0 "Ведение войны заключается в поставках и логистике, ведь как грифон будет воевать, если у него нет оружия или униформы? Последние события требуют принудительного увеличения темпов производства соответствующего оборудования, которое будет оплачено напрямую из кармана герцога. Маленькое вложение, которое принесёт солидные дивиденды в продолжительном выживании."
EYR_fund_economist:0 "Поправки в бухгалтерские книги"
EYR_fund_economist_desc:0 "Война это экономический ужас для всего Герцогства Эйри. Поддерживать развёрнутую армию невероятно дорого, и к тому же у нас есть некоторые проблемы с мобилизацией населения перед угрозой нападения. Впрочем, казначей Дома очень способная администратор и поэтому сможет достигнуть чуда, хоть это и потребует значительных затрат."
EYR_the_prelature:0 "Просить прелатуру о помощи"
EYR_the_prelature_desc:0 "Учитывая множество проблем с мобилизацией, нам ясно, что мы не сможем встретить атаку Дома Эри во всеоружии. Наши оборонительные позиции гарантируют, что мы сможем продержаться против орд противника, однако будет неплохо заручиться поддержкой рыцарей-паладинов. Эти доблестные воины всегда готовы к войне и смогут восполнить недостаток воинов... за соответствующую цену."
EYR_what_we_must:0 "В защиту Эйри"
EYR_what_we_must_desc:0 "Солдаты, рыцари, крестьяне, торговцы, благородные — все они прямо или косвенно сражаются за Дом Эйри. Пришло время привести их всех в повышенную готовность, мобилизовать все возможности перед надвигающимся штормом. Мы должны работать все вместе, чтобы пережить его."
EYR_militias:0 "Крестьянское ополчение"
EYR_militias_desc:0 "Они ворчат и жалуются, но у простогрифонов есть неизбежные обязательства перед теми, кто выше их. Это не злоупотребление властью, а скорее продолжение социального договора, который существовал между грифонами многие века назад. К оружию, крестьяне, за Дом Эйри, за Верению!"
EYR_defence_plan:0 "Перехитрить их планы"
EYR_defence_plan_desc:0 "Проклятый Винсент это неотёсанный болван, и явно не он определяет стратегию нападения. Его подчинённые куда более компетентны, и прямо сейчас, без сомнений, вынашивают какие-то хитроумные планы. Нам необходимо решить как действовать, чтобы эффективно противостоять любым неожиданностям, которые они могут изобрести. Герцог организует встречу с новым капитаном-стражем и его офицерами."
EYR_holding_fast:0 "Пережить нападение"
EYR_holding_fast_desc:0 "Мы сплотились так, как смогли, и война неизбежна. Мы не сомневаемся, что по другую сторону реки заметили наши приготовления, но они всё ещё собираются атаковать. Пускай они обломают зубы о нашу оборону, а затем мы сами перейдём в наступление и положим конец Борьбе, унёсшей так много жизней."

EYR_stalemate_reigns:0 "Патовая ситуация"
EYR_stalemate_reigns_desc:0 "Герцог крайне недоволен непослушными подчинёнными. Был чёткий план, с которым согласились все грифоны, и ему никто не последовал. Это очень слабое утешение для всех погибших душ, ведь нам пришлось заключить перемирие как будто ничего не случилось. Что-то должно измениться в этом сломанном доме."

EYR_the_state_of_the_treasury:0 "Анализ экономики"
EYR_the_state_of_the_treasury_desc:0 "Казначей Дома это очень талантливая грифина, особенно когда заходит речь о распределении валюты. Без неё наши солдаты представляли бы собой оборванцев, а экономика деградировала до бартера. Если мы доверимся её невероятным способностям, то Дом Эйри сможет выйти победителем в Борьбе и без неуправляемых благородных."
EYR_the_local_economy:0 "Разобраться с дорожной проблемой"
EYR_the_local_economy_desc:0 "Постоянное использование нашей инфраструктуры в военных целях привело к её износу. У нас слишком мало ресурсов для их поддержания, однако последние события дали нам возможность это исправить. Однако видение этой возможности у всех разное, в то время как денег у нас не так уж и много..."
EYR_consoomer_goods:0 "Привлечение к работе крепостных"
EYR_consoomer_goods_desc:0 "Крепостное право - это привычное дело в Верении, хорошо это или плохо. Строить новые фабрики легко и просто, но нехватка рабочей силы сильно снижает темпы производства. Необходимо провести новые переговоры со знатью, чтобы эти бесправные грифоны могли сделать что-то более полезное, чем обработка очередного бесплодного поля."
EYR_solving_resource_deficits:0 "Расширить горнодобывающую промышленность"
EYR_solving_resource_deficits_desc:0 "Плодородные поля  - это не единственное качество, которым обладают земли Верении. Существует огромное количество многообещающих месторождений с множеством природных ресурсов. И хотя сейчас у нас хватает производства для удовлетворения собственных потребностей, в отличие от некомпетентной марионетки на другом берегу реки, растущая промышленность потребует большего производства. Лучше заранее подготовиться к этой задаче."
EYR_funding_a_solution:0 "Восполняя недостатки"
EYR_funding_a_solution_desc:0 "В тайне от большинства казначей Дома занимается незаконными схемами. Самой глобальной из них является торговля оружием, которая приносит солидную часть средств. Герцог задумался о расширении подобных операций, однако им понадобиться куда лучшее прикрытие, чтобы благородные не узнали о том, что их немного обсчитывают."
EYR_embargo_vincent:0 "Предложить выгодную сделку"
EYR_embargo_vincent_desc:0 "И хотя большинство стран отказываются как-то участвовать в Борьбе, обычная торговля продолжает идти. Именно это позволяет Винсенту оставаться на плаву, несмотря на игнорирование нужд собственных подданных. Возможно, если эти страны получат стимул прекратить подобную торговлю, то Дом Эри окажется в куда более невыгодном положении при последней битве."
EYR_better_weapons:0 "Схема модернизации огнестрельного оружия"
EYR_better_weapons_desc:0 "За столетия огнестрельное оружие претерпело значительный прогресс, начиная от простого мушкета и заканчивая современной винтовкой. Фрейя проявила к нему лишь мимолётный интерес, но она знает, что чем лучше оружие, тем больше шансы на успех. Простая математика, объясняющая почему эта отрасль заслуживает финансирования."
EYR_devil_deal:0 "Продать гордость и кровь"
EYR_devil_deal_desc:0 "Банкиры Фловены представляют собой единое общество, но некоторые из них были бы рады поработать за спинами своих коллег за разумную цену. По воле случая Фрейя дружит с некоторыми из них, и те могут обойти блокаду, которую банки несправедливо наложили на Дом Эйри. Конечно, ничего не бывает бесплатным, однако окончание Борьбы будет стоить любых средств. Главное только по итогу не продать им саму Верению."

EYR_touring_the_barracks:0 "Осмотреть казармы"
EYR_touring_the_barracks_desc:0 "И хотя капитан-страж грифон с грубым характером, солдаты следуют за ним, будь то из страха или преданности. Чтобы показать солдатам, что сюзерен заботиться о них, Иовин посетит раненых грифонов и, возможно, раздаст медали, где это уместно. Разумеется, основной целью будет разработка нового плана обороны, дабы предотвратить повторение недавних событий."
EYR_factory_expansion_project:0 "Проект расширения промышленности"
EYR_factory_expansion_project_desc:0 "Верения - не самый богатый регион, но это не значит, что её производственные мощности должны быть переданы какому-нибудь жадюге из из Роттендедама. Вместо этого мы должны стимулировать наших промышленных магнатов расширять свои возможности, нанимать больше местных работников и всё в этом духе. Конечно, последуют некоторые негативные последствия, но до тех пор пока Дом Эйри получает выгоду в целом, с этим можно мириться."
EYR_repair_forts:0 "Спасти всё что можно"
EYR_repair_forts_desc:0 "Все те немногочисленные укрепления, которые у нас есть на данный момент, находятся на грани разрушения, и нам приходится тратить множество усилий на то, чтобы хоть как-то их поддерживать. И это при наших скудных ресурсах. Есть много причин, почему мы не можем их модернизировать в структуру, которая могла бы держать сброд Винсента в узде. Однако сейчас необходимо уделить им должное внимание."
EYR_tithes_and_tribute:0 "Впечатляющая коллекция герцога"
EYR_tithes_and_tribute_desc:0 "Как и у любого порядочного благородного, у Иовина есть обширная коллекция произведений искусства, монет, одежды и драгоценных металлов. Такое богатство сможет профинансировать целые полки сражаться на нашей стороне... если бы его конечно удалось убедить расстаться с чем-либо из этого. Разумеется, всё это можно будет выкупить после войны... а если он не одержит победу, то у бывшего герцога будут проблемы поважнее."
EYR_enact_conscription:0 "Восполнить стражу"
EYR_enact_conscription_desc:0 "По множеству причин достаточно трудно установить сколько грифонов сейчас служит в веренийской страже. Тем не менее, недавнее кровопролитие вызвало здравые опасения, что наших профессиональных сил будет недостаточно, чтобы противостоять следующей атаке. Нет никаких сомнений, что рано или поздно она произойдёт, и поэтому квоты на расширение рядов должны быть увеличены, а для самого герцога должны быть сформированы новые полки."
EYR_calm_the_nobles:0 "Организовать бал"
EYR_calm_the_nobles_desc:0 "В эти неспокойные времена мы должны положиться на наши традиции и продемонстрировать самым важным грифонам страны, что всё под контролем. В великом дворце не проводились собрания с мирных времён, поэтому почему бы нашим доблестным благородным не расслабится в кои-то веки? Разумеется торговцы и прочая нежелательная чернь не будут допущены, и им лучше не ворчать по этому поводу!"
EYR_righteousness_of_our_cause:0 "Убедить крестьян"
EYR_righteousness_of_our_cause_desc:0 "Неудивительно что Борьба не очень волнует большинство грифонов. В конце концов, у них есть и другие заботы, чем какая-та далёкая война во имя равнодушного сюзерена. Однако, возможно, большую их часть можно переубедить. Словом или наградой, а может и избирательной правдой, мы сможем собрать куда больше добровольцев."
EYR_hold_court:0 "День при двореа"
EYR_hold_court_desc:0 "Одним из многих обязательств герцога перед своими подданными является ежегодное проведение приёма при дворе. Там грифоны, у которых больше не осталось другого выбора, излагают свои жалобы и просьбы, после чего великодушный правитель либо рассматривает, либо отклоняет их требования. Щедрость может вдохновить народ, но данные обещания могут иметь долгоиграющие последствия."
EYR_aerial_advantage:0 "Иной угол атаки"
EYR_aerial_advantage_desc:0 "Некоторые благородные являются сторонниками технологического развития и отлично понимают, что для получения преимущества на поле боя необходимо изменить наш подход. С помощью своих связей в Герцланде они могли бы сделать для нас доступными самолёты, которым Дом Эри не сможет противостоять. Единственная проблема заключается в том, что у нас никто не умеет ими управлять, но это можно легко исправить, если мы попросту наймём опытных пилотов."
EYR_officer_training:0 "Заполняя пробелы в знаниях"
EYR_officer_training_desc:0 "Все офицеры Веренийской стражи это благородные, знакомые с военным мастерством, однако методы ведения войны очень быстро меняются. С учётом знаний, полученных за десятилетия борьбы, мы должны выделить некоторые ресурсы на обучение нынешних и будущих офицеров, как действовать наиболее эффективно. Это может изменить ход сражений буквально в ближайшем будущем..."
EYR_unassailable_defence:0 "Ну давай, нападай, Винсент!"
EYR_unassailable_defence_desc:0 "Теперь, когда все несогласные усмирены, план будет исполнен как надо. Река Аранти наводнится мёртвыми телами противника, однако план сам по себе должен быть достаточно гибким. Никто не знает, что может выкинуть в отчаянии такая загнанная в угол змея, как Винсент. Мы должны быть готовы ко всему, и капитан-страж позаботится об этом."

EYR_the_temple_of_eyr:0 "Духовная отдушина"
EYR_the_temple_of_eyr_desc:0 "В то время как многие не доверяют веренийской прелатессе (и обоснованно боятся её свирепого взгляда), Иовин не разделяет подобного отношения. Он понимает, что подконтрольные ей многочисленные ресурсы могут иметь решающее значение в объединении Верении, даже если многие посчитают, что это сделка с Мааром. Тем не менее, ничто не сможет помешать герцогу посетить проповедь."
EYR_look_for_the_poor:0 "Помочь нуждающимся"
EYR_look_for_the_poor_desc:0 "Борьба оставила многих грифонов без средств к существованию, будь то из-за налогов, тяжёлых ранений, полученных в бою, или других неприятных последствий. Из-за этого образовалось огромное количество бездомных, которых даже храм Эйр с трудом может прокормить. Если герцог протянет им коготь помощи, это продемонстрирует его преданность богам и, что более важно, уберёт шатающихся повсюду бродяг с улиц Каламбура."
EYR_pleb_schools:0 "Распространяя правильную мудрость"
EYR_pleb_schools_desc:0 "Традиционно образование является роскошью, предназначенной для более состоятельных грифонов, из-за чего многие вынуждены полагаться на обычную народную "мудрость". Нынешние обстоятельства не слишком благоприятны в отношении какой-либо полномасштабной политики обязательного школьного образования, но мы могли бы выделить некоторую сумму для этих целей. И конечно, мы обязательно позаботимся о том, чтобы новые знания были “правильными” в нужных местах."
EYR_bless_the_fields:0 "Щедроты земли"
EYR_bless_the_fields_desc:0 "Множество легенд Верении приписывают Эйр огромное количество чудес, случавшихся за долгую историю страны. И хотя пытаться доказать реальность влияния божества на нас - всё равно что сражаться с драконами голыми когтями, ритуалы внушают грифонам чувство комфорта и безопасности, которое трудно получить иным способом. Прелат с радостью окажет парочку подобных услуг при должном финансировании."
EYR_the_paladins:0 "Гордые представители триархии"
EYR_the_paladins_desc:0 "Продолжительное сотрудничество с прелатурой ставит Иовина в неудобное положение. Благородные находят множество оправданий и лазеек, чтобы сократить предоставляемых добровольцев для войны, убеждённые в том, что герцог продает Верению иностранным интересам. Что за нелепые обвинения! И всё же у нас не остаётся другого выбора, кроме как реинтегрировать остатки паладинов в основные силы Дома."
EYR_tax_of_piety:0 "Элеос Эйр"
EYR_tax_of_piety_desc:0 "Согласно древним законам, существовавшим со времён Гровера I, храмы не собирают никаких налогов или дани. Они существуют за счёт пожертвований или взносов своего духовенства. Однако*, законы могут быть легко изменены подписью герцога, и к тому же прелатуре было бы крайне выгодно, если им позволят взимать десятую часть налогов с крепостных. Часть этих средств пойдёт на угодные герцогу дела."
EYR_strike_fear:0 "Страх силы свыше"
EYR_strike_fear_desc:0 "В Верении живёт множество грифонов, которым совершенно не хватает элементарного образования. Суеверные, пугливые, их довольно легко заставить поверить во что-то, что они даже не понимают. У прелата есть много контактов на западном берегу реки Аранти, и если распространить правильное послание... Винсент получит хороший удар по своим когтям."
EYR_archonate_friends:0 "Наши друзья в Ромау"
EYR_archonate_friends_desc:0 "Хотя прелатура в основном независима от архонатов, ей всё же необходимо соблюдать определённые тонкости. Благодаря своим связям в Ромау Верена могла бы кардинально изменить исход борьбы, причём в нашу пользу. Единственный вопрос, который остаётся - это пойдёт ли Эрион XII на вмешательство в чужую страну и какую он за это запросит цену."

E_E_rivalry_eyrie:0 "War Of Two Houses"
E_E_rivalry_eyrie_desc:0 "§gSun-and-Moon,\nonce united and now divided,\nas Eyr weeps for her children.§!\n\nThe bitter feud between the rival houses of Eyrie and Erie - both houses as irreconcilable to each other as the Sun and Moon, day and night - has led to decades of incessant internecine violence between the two heavily militarised houses. Both leaders of the houses claim to be the rightful and legitimate Duke of Verenia, and both of them refuse to negotiate with each other.

EYR_not_our_war_2:0 "Clamour For Peace"
EYR_not_our_war_2_desc:0 "The war for Verenia has dragged on for a seemingly indefinite amount of time, even after many conflicts in surrounding regions ceased. As a result, the growing middle class and the landed peasantry are extremely hesitant to fight in the service of what they perceive to be an uncaring ruler, wishing nothing more than a return to normalcy and peace. Replenishment and recruitment of new regiments is quite difficult as a result, and the only reliable units are ones on the Duke's personal paycheck."

EYR_ducal_guard_leader:0 "Roman Eitelkeit"
EYR_ducal_guard_leader_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 12th of July, 963 in Angburg\n§YRank§!: Hauptgreif der Verenianischen Garde\n§YTitle§!: Markgraf von Angburg\n\n§YBiography§!§L: The Eitelkeits have been a fixture in Verenia since its founding days, and though they've held many influential positions over the years, they always considered themselves to be snubbed by the ruling family. Whether they felt that way out of misplaced pride or genuine contempt, none of them have held the honour of leading the Verenian Guard... until now.\n\nRoman considers himself a very pragmatic griffon. He sees a problem, and solves it in the most efficient way. He has little patience for the Duke's stalling strategy, and he has made that clear on many occasions. Even now, as the Captain of the Guard, he is forced to follow those orders, much to Roman's dismay. If he just could have been in charge when the whole rebellion started, it wouldn't have lasted for more than a year, or so he likes to think.\n\nNonetheless, the Guard-Captain is a capable leader, though not a creative one. His intense drilling standards ensure the common soldier is prepared for anything, who certainly don't need any poncy paladins! Perhaps, if Roman proves himself worthy by overcoming the vile secessionists, there could be a new rising star in Verenia.\n\n§!§YPortrait By§!: Bunnyshrubby"
EYR_prelate:0 "Verena Festfeder"
EYR_prelate_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 15th of November, 964 in Romau\n§YOccupation§!: Prälat von Verenia\n\n§YBiography§!§L: The Gods watch over all griffonkind, but They have their favourites, too. It is widely believed that Eyr blessed the fields of Verenia, giving them an abundant bounty.\n\nPerhaps Eyr watched over Verena as well, given her unlikely rise to the respectful position of prelate. She never knew her parents, her only relation was a sister that disappeared in the chaos of 978. Subsisting purely on eleos of the local temple, her only comfort in life was dedicating herself to the Triarchy. A good and righteous cause, for in a world full of misery, it was the duty of all griffons to bring comfort to the weary.\n\nHer assignment in Verenia was only meant to be a temporary one, but local conditions made her stay permanent. Time and again, she championed for the cause of peace and reconciliation between the Three Houses, but her pleas and prayers were routinely ignored. Additionally, as the prelature is officially in control of the Paladin Order, many of the local nobility distrust her, believing she's pursuing an agenda of her own. Already a stern and uncompromising griff of the robe, this treatment has steeled Verena's faith further. Only a scant few are righteous enough to pass her test of purity, and woe betide anygriff who end up the target of her admonishing gaze.\n\n§!§YPortrait By§!: Rari"

What was going to be her crowning achievement — promotion to the exclusive ranks of the paladin-captains — turned sour as most of the Proud Ones followed Vincent Erie in his unlawful secession. Sigrid was the highest paladin remaining in the service of House Eyrie, which led to her ascension as commander... with very few of the benefits.\n\nDistrusted by the local nobility and restrained by the Prelature, the once proud paladin turned dour as she was consigned to sitting at a desk, unable to take the field as befitting of a warrior.

#### EVENTS

eyrie.1.t:0 "A Brief Recollection Of Events"
eyrie.1.d:0 "I am Iovinus, heir to the Verenian legacy and patriarch of the noble house Eyrie, who have ruled these lands for centuries. For many years, I have been locked in a dynastic dispute with my irresponsible older half-sibling Vincent. How I loathe his irrational, thoughtless behaviour. It was I who should have succeeded to rulership after the horrid republican uprising, which left many family members dead, but he would not concede to the fact that it is House Erie that is subservient to House Eyrie.\n\nNow, there's been little peace, and even less respite. I watched many young and promising griffons march to the riverfront, only to learn that they've perished. It is their duty to serve their liege lord, yes, but I do not wish to throw lives away. None of this should have happened. Lady Amelinda, she helped with her surprising defection, but remained a mystery with her intentions. Her daughter Katrina will have to see reason in the end. It is my Gods given right to rule Verenia, and restore her splendour to how it was.\n\nThe commoners despise us, yet more backlash comes from my supposedly subservient nobles. Instead of wisely digging in, time and again they've wasted our power on futile attacks. Worse still, they distrust the paladins, Verenia's sworn guardians.\n\nThis story has been dragged on for too long. How will it end? Nobody but the Gods know, and they don't talk."
eyrie.1.a:0 "The claw of fate guides us all."

eyrie.2.t:0 "Defence Of The Realm"
eyrie.2.d:0 "Iovinus was not pleased with the situation he ended up in. Yes, the impending attack was most worrisome, but he was far more happier with Guard-Captain von Grieslein, who had dutifully followed his attrition strategy, than the new Guard-Captain Eitelkeit, who was among the most vocal ones clamouring for a decisive strike. In spite of the fact that all previous attempts had failed, they continued insisting... and now one of them was in charge of the war planning.\n\n"Let us hear what you have prepared, Guard-Captain." While the Duke could overrule his subordinates, it would undoubtedly cause unnecessary friction. This was not a time for arguments, and they would either work together or die together.\n\nIn his tightly fitting uniform, the Guard-Captain looked very much like an imposing force that was not to be crossed with. Nodding wordlessly, he would stand up to present his strategy over the detailed map of the Aranti riverline. "Mein Herzog, with the limited time and resources at our disposal, there is little other recourse but to continue using our existing plans. However, with the help from our informants on the other side, orders have been prepared to reinforce areas we expect to bear the brunt of their attack." It was short, brief and to the point.\n\nIt was a surprisingly... reasonable course, and Iovinus could not offer any protests in the matter. The other, lower ranking officers of the Guard more or less agreed with their Captain, and only thing left was clearing some minor concerns. The Duke dearly hoped there would be no insubordination this time. He still remembered the last one."
eyrie.2.a:0 "Endure, we shall once more."

eyrie.3.t:0 "Overstretched Demands"
eyrie.3.d:0 "It was a straightforward plan: have the rabble crash themselves upon the riverline defences, then strike back once they were sufficiently weakened with losses and peasant grumbling.\n\nYet it turned out almost not at all as intended! The idea of holding the fort proved to be too much for some of the Watch Officers, who in their common disobedience started launching attacks against Erian holdings. To little surprise, it amounted to nothing and the current stalemate is a direct consequence of such. He dearly wondered what he had done to deserve such contempt and disrespect. What was going on in their thick bird skulls to act contrary to his well laid plans?\n\nThus Iovinus was forced into making an act himself, and through his contacts west of the Aranti, he knew Vincent would be willing to accept another ceasefire. What a farce this whole conflict turned out to be! The comforts of his warm room turned out to be less than pleasing as he awaited for his so-called loyal retinue to arrive, for their well-needed and much deserved scoldings."
eyrie.3.a:0 "Humiliation is the best teacher."

eyrie.4.t:0 "A Ceasefire Offer"
eyrie.4.d:0 "Vincent was not pleased in the slightest to have yet another invasion bogged down in a stalemate, but a gift from Boreas would show up at his doorstep today: that idiot Iovinus decided he was tired of playing war and wanted a ceasefire. Now ordinarily that would earn him a firm and sound rejection, but the sad truth that he heard yesterday from Cyrille was that House Erie was not doing too well either.\n\nEven better, there was an indemnity promised in this! Despite gaining nothing from this but a long list for burial, it sated his spite. However, things would have to change for the next time, and Vincent resolved to take decisive action. Verenia would be his or he'd die trying."
eyrie.4.a:0 "Take that, Iovinus! Sheepherding reprobate!"

eyrie.5.t:0 "Invasion Repulsed!"
eyrie.5.d:0 "Iovinus believed his plan to be satisfying, and for the most part it did: Erian attacks amounted to nothing, yet counterattacks fizzled out just as much. Many meetings were held with his command staff, but nothing could be decisively concluded as to why Vincent's rabble resisted so fiercely. Fortunately, a way out of this mess presented itself today.\n\nHis "dearest" sibling was tired of war and wanted yet another ceasefire, and offered a great deal of idols to make it so. If he were in a better position, it would be laughed out of the room, yet this would have to suffice for the time being. The warmongers would complain, but even they would have to concede that the situation is untenable. However, something had to change in this House if they were to succeed next time."
eyrie.5.a:0 "Another spectacular failure from Vincent."

eyrie.6.t:0 "On A Minute's Notice"
eyrie.6.d:0 "When the dukes of the past moved from the fortress outside of Calembourg to the ostentatiously named "grand palace" (more of a fancier manor home, really) inside the city, they intended to keep it purely as a private residence. Practicality, however, resulted in a different outcome, and now Iovinus was taking a leisurely stroll to where Freya, the house treasurer, oversaw a small army of idol counters that kept his state fiscally solvent.\n\nThe large hall, dubbed the "administration quarter", was full of overly busy griffs. Desks were full of papers, and in some cases idols, assisted by primitive machinery that helped lessen the burden of mathematical calculations. If only everygriff could work so tirelessly and efficiently for his cause. Iovinus was quick to find the lady in charge, helpfully standing in the middle of the room.\n\n"How you manage this on a daily basis is most impressive, Freya. Where would House Eyrie be without you?" Large requests needed a decent amount of praise, of course.\n\nThe neatly dressed griff looked away from her clipboard, beaming with joy at her Duke. "Why thank you kindly, Iovinus!" He appreciated that she was comfortable enough to be informal. "There's nothing quite like fixing issues and trying to make them better. It's an endless chore, but the satisfaction is worthwhile. Now, what brings you here? Not much time for idle chat."\n\nShort sigh. "War's coming again, Freya. The mobilisation isn't happening quickly enough and I need you and your abilities to make it happen. My sources in House Erie say there's but a few weeks left." Why waste words trying to hide things.\n\nHer enthusiasm momentarily faltered, but she would turn around and pick up a few forms. "You should have come to me earlier, mein Herzog, but it won't be an issue. I trust I'm allowed to make the necessary expenditures?" If there's anygriff he trusted to spend money, it was Freya."
eyrie.6.a:0 "A real miracle maker."

eyrie.7.t:0 "At The Summit Of Eyr"
eyrie.7.d:0 "The disused fortress was the highest point near Calembourg, but within the city itself, the place of honour belonged to Eyr's temple which stood upon a hill. This was where Iovinus was headed today, despite the protests of his vassals: he wanted the paladins to help repulse Vincent's assault, and he simply couldn't mobilise enough of the regular forces in time.\n\nThe interior was ascetic in accordance with divine mandate, yet comforting in a way that was difficult to describe. Iovinus would briefly close his eyes and exhale, his worries briefly fading, before looking around for the griff on his mind. It was easy to find her, with that distinct circlet and hood, as he passed between several attendees who paid their Duke no heed.\n\nBut the prelate was occupied in conversation with her paladin protector, who sensed a figure approaching and turned her head around. "It seems we have an important visitor, Verena." Said paladin lowered her head deferentially, moving next to Verena, who regarded Iovinus with her usual cold gaze.\n\n"That we do, Sigrid. What can the Prelature do for our Duke of Eyrie today?" Unlike her companion, Verena did not offer any sort of respectful gesture. It didn't bother him in the slightest for Iovinus was used to her unyielding behaviour.\n\n"There'll be another invasion soon, Prelate. I need the paladins to rebuff this attack." Short and to the point, as he always liked it. The pair exchanged glances and whispered between themselves, but he could tell Sigrid was welcoming the prospect of battle. Quickly would Verena address Iovinus again.\n\n"Are you prepared to meet the recent requests, my Duke?" A small nod. "Even knowing there will be displeasure at the court?" A more hesitant nod. "Then we are prepared to serve in the defence of your cause.""
eyrie.7.a:0 "The paladins march once more."

eyrie.8.t:0 "The Accountant's Thick Tome"
eyrie.8.d_no_help:0 "Iovinus felt slightly guilty over not giving more time for his favourite advisor, but circumstances simply got in the way. Nonetheless, he was always more than happy to be sitting in Freya's private office, sharing a fresh cup of tea and scones together. It always gave him a slight chuckle as he noticed that the room was hastily ordered into something more presentable.\n\n"I am no fan of carnage or violence, but I have to admit it was quite the sight to witness our paladins marching through the city streets, and out to war." As always, Freya multitasked her conversations with doing paperwork. "Please accept my apologies again for not meeting the mobilisation quotas in time, mein Herzog."\n\nIndeed, the paladins were quite spectacular in their armour, and of course their performance. Yet it did nothing to dissuade the nobility that they shouldn't look down on them. "And again, Freya, it was not your fault. Personally, I could have done much better myself to spread the information around, and give you plenty of time needed. Still, it turned out good enough, even if nothing has changed in the end." And that hurt the most. Trapped, with nowhere to go.\n\n"Very well, Iovinus, I will accept your word as the truth. The reason I've called for you today is quite simple: our idol gatherers have done their work, and we have funds to work with, even after reserving the necessary amounts for future expenses. How it shall be spent, I leave the choice to you." A paper containing several underlined numbers was passed, and the Duke briefly indulged a daydream what he would do with such a generous sum. First, the cold reality."

eyrie.8.a:0 "We could make use of this."

eyrie.9.t:0 "The Divine's Representative"
eyrie.9.d_helped_before:0 ""Turn your gaze, Verena, for our noble guest returns." Iovinus briefly wondered if these two were joined at the wing, given how rare it was to not see them together. "I shall return to my duties post-haste." With a servile bow, Sigrid brushed past the Duke and left the temple. If she suffered any exertions from the recent battle, the knight-commander did not show it.\n\n"Eyr's blessings upon you, my Duke. Did the paladins' performance impress you? It is such a pity that the righteous and just are considered untrustworthy by the envious." The reasons why the nobility wanted nothing to do with the knightly order was more nuanced than simple grudges, although it did seem petty like that at times.\n\n"We owe them our freedom, and may they recuperate well in the following days. Please extend me an invitation for the upcoming festival, but there is a more pressing matter at claw." The prelate's stern expression only allowed a brief change. "I like the current situation as much as you do. We can't persist in this Struggle forever, and I am willing to disregard the opinions of the 'envious', as you say, if it means putting an end to this farce. May I count on your and the paladins' support in the coming days?" It was as much pleading as Iovinus could allow himself.\n\nThe response didn't take long. "What you ask is unnecessary. The Prelature has always been at your beck and call, it is merely the unfortunate circumstances that prevent us from working together. To show that we are committed to your cause, I will arrange for a donation to your cause. Make best use of it, for Eyr does not appreciate those who squander." This was... far better than Iovinus expected, but he needed to make sure none of his dealings were heard back at the court."
eyrie.9.d_no_help:0 "Iovinus could not recall the last time he visited the temple, and that fact shamed him; considering himself a rather reverent griff, he could do better. Nonetheless, the cold stone floors and the faint scent of fragrant smoke put his mind at ease. He should definitely spend more time here, away from all the worries and nagging.\n\nThere, the hooded figure waited for him, alongside a paladin in shining armour. To the business at claw, then. "My gratitude for agreeing to meet at such short notice, Prelate. I think we can both agree that the current situation cannot continue, lest we have a repeat of 978. Furthermore, I am keenly aware there are difficulties preventing our cooperation... but that can be circumvented. Can I count on your support in the upcoming difficult days?" If they were surprised by how quickly Iovinus got to his demands, they weren't showing it. After a short while, he would get the prelate's response.\n\n"We welcome your change of heart, my Duke, though it certainly seemed that you had no need for our assistance thus far. Regardless, the Prelature is committed to the success of the true heirs to the Verenian legacy, and to that end I will prepare a donation to your cause. Do not allow the wicked and envious to squander this generosity." Could it truly be this easy? "However, if you expect further support, we expect in return a proper show of dedication." The previously silent knight-commander, gleaming in her panoply, nodded in agreement with her superior.\n\nIt was never straightforward."

eyrie.10.t:0 "Inspecting The Verenian Guard"
eyrie.10.d:0 "All things considered, the losses in the scuffle were not all that debilitating. The wounded were tended to, fortifications restaffed, and usable equipment from the fallen was scavenged. The most pressing concern, however, was giving the soldiery a much needed morale boost. To that end, Iovinus organised several inspections with the Guard-Captain (which he did not relish, given recent events), but the appearance of unity was paramount.\n\nThus they walked together past lines and lines of soldiers, standing at attention with their rifles raised. Iovinus had to admire their discipline, their resolve, and of course their stylish dress uniforms. Too bad they did little good at the frontline... "At ease, griffons!" The practised tone of a disciplinarian had the order produce a satisfying effect. With that, Roman turned to face him for a word in private.\n\n"Edler Herr, the Verenian Guard is a trained and professional force. It does not need foreigners or paladins to achieve our goals." If only its commanders were equally restrained in their judgement. Nonetheless, he accepted the fact that the regular forces were more than capable, given how they bravely stood their ground recently."

eyrie.11.t:0 "Simpleminded Superstition"
eyrie.11.d:0 "An average peasant possesses enough smarts to live about their daily business, but when it comes to nuance, they're sadly lacking in this regard. In recent times, many reports have been received about the rabble claiming ominous portents, that "the end is nigh", and even cases of mass hysteria, which has negatively resulted on productivity. As it is plain to see, the world is still here, and Maar's fires have not enveloped the sky.\n\nWho is behind spreading this panic remains unclear, but some whispers talk about the local priesthood agitating the crowd during sermons. However, there are plenty of other leads available, meaning it will take some time before this farce can be dispersed."

On rainy days they turn to mud." Freya decided not to mince words. "I understand that our claws are full of expenses, but is there absolutely nothing that can be spared to alleviate the issue by at least some margin?"\n\nIn truth Iovinus wouldn't know anything about the condition of roads given that he hadn't left Calembourg for at least over a year, but this did sound quite alarming. But before he could issue his agreement, the Guard-Captain offered a rebuttal.\n\n"Let us not be so hasty, noble lord!" And you could have some better manners, Roman. "What our treasurer says is correct. However, your larger concern should be our railways and trains. Warfare as it is these days depends heavily on quick transportation of forces, and even in our static situation it cannot be disregarded. I feel regret that our populace has to rely on such poor roads—" Did he truly feel that way? "—but you have my personal promise that I'll fund their improvement after our final victory." With that, he raised a claw to his chest, making a pledging gesture.\n\nTime was short, idols were short, and decisions had to be made quickly. Iovinus ruminated on his options."

eyrie.16.d:0 ""What do you mean, nogriff wants to trade with us? What is this nonsense?" Vincent was most perturbed by this sudden interruption of his quality free time, glaring at the stammering official as he rattled off words from a report.\n\n"W-what I mean is, y-your lordship, is that our foreign neighbours have cut us off entirely from their markets, suspending all shipments of resources, consumer goods, grain and..."\n\n"But we need those! How could this happen, I thought everything was under control?! How will we maintain our war measures if we can't even feed our peasants?" While the Duke didn't know much about international commerce or production line capacities, it was painfully clear an embargo was very bad news, especially for his impoverished lands.\n\n"W-we don't know! Nothing has changed in our agreements, this must be Iovinus' scheme..."\n\nVincent's eyes narrowed as he immediately charted a very rational and reasonable conclusion how that scoundrel could have plotted this. Of course it's all Iovinus' fault! "Get back to work, servant, and figure out some way to fix this." Just like that, the griff scampered, leaving him to brood and ponder an even more cruel vengeance once he got east of the Aranti..."
eyrie.16.a:0 ""IOOVINUUUUS! You utter vile scum!""

eyrie.17.t:0 "The Price Of Disobedience"
eyrie.17.d:0 "Silence reigned as Iovinus passively observed his commanders. Some of them had the shame to be looking at the floor, yet some stood proud and defiant in their expressions. That would have to be curbed soon enough. To the side, Freya was making notes while frightful Verena was glaring her own daggers for reasons best known to her. Undoubtedly somegriff will be complaining about her presence. With a claw pressed to his forehead, he began:\n\n"Guard-Captain Eitelkeit... I hope there is some very good reason for why I had to intervene and stop this conflict before a riot broke outside these walls. What sort of excuse do you have for yourself and your underlings?" He couldn't quite match the tone his wife made when she lectured their children, but it would have to suffice for the time being.\n\nOne could hear nary but the whistling of the wind, before eventually a response came. "Noble Duke, your strategy was flawed. Sitting and waiting wouldn't have done us any good, and we were running out of ammunition for our artillery, thus doing nothing would have only resulted in—"\n\nBut Iovinus would have none of it. "Do you consider me ignorant, Guard-Captain? This is precisely why my orders were to stand down and let them break ourselves at the river crossings. We didn't mobilise enough griffs or equipment for attacks, and we have nothing to show for these three months besides a casualty list that's almost as bad as theirs." He expected much more pushback, yet this time all were left stunned and speechless. The less guilty ones looked in his direction, apprehension in their features. "Let it be a lesson for you all: I have nothing but the best interests of my House in mind, and I will not tolerate further acts of disloyalty. From now on, I'll be taking a personal claw in the matter so that we may finally achieve victory after almost 30 years of this fighting.""
eyrie.17.a:0 ""Now begone, and remember your place.""

eyrie.18.t:0 "Beloved One's Letter"
eyrie.18.d:0 "Despondent and morose, Iovinus spent most of his recent days sequestered in his chambers, much like a punished chick. He left strict orders not to be disturbed, and the bliss of solitude helped to calm him after the most recent fiasco. Nogriff wanted this Struggle, yet they were all chained by it, seemingly forever, the burden of responsibility crushing even the most resolute griff.\n\nBut he didn't despair yet. What kept Iovinus' thoughts steady were his dearest wife's words, written on fine vellum. He went over them so many times, he could recite it by heart, recall with perfection the subtle quirks in her griffonage. The contents were most mundane, but it pleased him to no end knowing she and their chicks were safe and sound. Lothra and Lorien... his daughters were his greatest treasure, far more than anything in this accursed Verenia.\n\nThey were so far away, though. It broke Iovinus to do so, but he sent them away to their vacation home, at the outskirts of Skyfall. If anything happened to him... at least they would be safe, and he alone could suffer the consequences of failure."
eyrie.18.a:0 "Corinna... you'll come back soon, I promise."

eyrie.19.t:0 "The Court Of The Sunlight Shield"
eyrie.19.d:0 "Iovinus did not relish holding court. It was one of his obligations, yes, but it was difficult to make a decision which left both parties satisfied, and he always had to be mindful of how his courtiers would respond. At least such a hesitation did not occur when justice was being dispensed: lawbreakers were guilty not just in the eyes of their betters, but the Gods as well.\n\nThus he took a seat at the throne of his father, the chamber filled and awaiting his word. Roman stood by his side, the immaculate uniform firmly pressed as always, acting as his advisor in all matters of state and justice. It was Iovinus' choice to have him make decisions in his stead, and he tended to leave what he perceived as less popular outcomes to the Graf.\n\n"All rise! The Duke of Eyrie and the liege lord of all Verenia has declared this session of the court to be open. Petitioners will approach one by one and present their requests." Roman's booming baritone stiffened anygriff who seemed to be dozing off, before he turned to Iovinus and continued in a more sotto voce. "The griffs were pre-approved in advance to avoid a repeat of last time, but there is still a sizeable number waiting. If you feel this to be beneath your dignity, I shall carry on with the proceedings in your name."\n\nIovinus peered ahead and confirmed that yes, there were plenty of both commoners and upper crusts waiting. As much as he wished to slip away from this droll doldrum, it was not a good idea to depend on Roman too much. Publicly overriding his decisions could result in further disobedience, yet nogriff would question their Herzog in this very room."
eyrie.19.a:0 ""May the first griffon proceed at their leisure.""
eyrie.19.b:0 "Let Roman take care of everything. Pretend to be listening."

eyrie.20.t:0 "Farmer's Case"
eyrie.20.d:0 ""The Court will be hearing a case against Konrad, a petty farmer." Thus called the court herald's voice as a scrawny griff was brought before the Duke. Iovinus already pitied the ragged appearance, but the appearance of impassivity was paramount. Roman continued where the herald left off. "He stands guilty of having stolen from the ducal granaries, and attempted to flee and resist arrest. The punishment for stealing from the crown is death, but Konrad has used his right to plead for mercy and lenience." Those last few words came out like an insult from Roman's beak.\n\n"This appears to be an issue without a mystery. Konrad, what do you have to say in defence of your actions?" What will it be this time.\n\n"M-mercy, your lordship! My family was starving as our harvest failed this year. We have nothing to eat, please spare me!" The broken griff dropped to the floor as he cried and begged in-between unintelligible words. Iovinus looked around as all the high and mighty looked with faces of disgust, but proper bearing prevented them from voicing their displeasures.\n\n"Spare yourself some dignity, Konrad, for I have made my decision." One last hopeful look from the miserable being."
eyrie.20.a:0 ""Hang this griffon, as a deterrent for all thieves.""
eyrie.20.b:0 ""Have him flogged and given a month's ration of food.""
eyrie.20.c:0 ""Conscript him and his village into the militia.""

eyrie.21.t:0 "Merchant's Grumbling"
eyrie.21.d:0 ""The Court will be hearing a petition from Arvin Geldklaue, a Calembourgian merchant." Iovinus' eyes narrowed. What do the vultures want this time? Another city to burn, perhaps? With a bow, the finely dressed griff introduced himself.\n\n"On behalf of the Merchant's Guild, I thank you for allowing me this opportunity to present our plea. My Duke, as you are well aware, the stringent tariffs placed on all mercantile activity has severely hampered any growth and thus led to the current sorry state. We understand that you require the funds for the war effort, but if these taxes were lowered, it would be a benefit to Verenia as a whole." As the idol pincher began to inundate the conversation with statistics and economic theory, he was cut off by Roman.\n\n"I would advise against this petition, my Duke. The tariffs are meant to protect our feeble industry from foreigners and their unequal deals, even at the expense of our domestic growth. This could be discussed again after we crush the secessionists, but now is not the time."\n\n"Or perhaps our obliging nobility could pay a larger share to the treasury." The merchant quipped in a very helpful and sarcastic manner, earning a glare from most of the room's occupants. Iovinus had to admit he considered the idea from time to time, but he knew it would be resisted at every pawstep.\n\n"That'll be enough, Arvin. Here is what the Court has decided." So many eyes staring at him."
eyrie.21.a:0 ""Your request has been granted, for the time being.""
eyrie.21.b:0 ""At this time we cannot accept this.""
eyrie.21.c:0 ""Halve the tariff at the expense of a new tax for the nobles.""

eyrie.22.t:0 "Nobles' Dispute"
eyrie.22.d:0 ""The Court will be hearing a dispute between House Weingut and House von Geisslerg, loyal vassals of House Eyrie." Important names, thus all the more important decision. Two griffs, in all their finery, took place before the Duke, glaring daggers at each other all the while. Iovinus accepted their well-meaning words and motioned for the left griff to begin.\n\n"My lord and duke of Eyrie, I urge you to resolve this issue once and for all. My family, the House of Weingut, have served yours for many years, and we only wish to continue doing so." Quite the effort for flattery, yes. "House von Geisslerg has promised ours a parcel of land as part of a dowry, but they have reneged on their agreement. We only ask you to uphold a fair and honest agreement."\n\nCould it really be so simple? "What does House von Geisslerg say to this?"\n\nThe right griffon, who was having the most incredulous look for a while, spoke. "The words are true, but what my equal forgot to mention is that their bride turned out to be a liar and a cheater with no respect for marital vows. We do not consider ourselves bound to an agreement where one side is blatantly disho—"\n\n"How dare you speak of my sister like this! I'll have your feathers plucked!" But before the adoring rivals could swing claws at each other, Roman's harsh tone turned them into meek chicks. What to do? The Geisslergs were one of the less problematic vassals, yes, but they were poorer compared to the Weinguts. However, the latter were obvious lackeys of the Eitelkeits, and Roman didn't need more influence in this court."
eyrie.22.a:0 ""House Weingut shall have their land, as agreed.""
eyrie.22.b:0 ""House von Geisslerg will retain their land, and be given an indemnity."" 
eyrie.22.c:0 ""House Eyrie will temporarily take control of this land.""

eyrie.23.t:0 "Soldier's Duty"
eyrie.23.d:0 ""The Court will be hearing a case against Wilfried, a soldier of the Guard accused of desertion." Peculiar. Why was this brought before him, instead of having the Guard-Captain resolve it himself? The bound griffon did not seem particularly frightened. Roman took over from the herald. "Noble lord, Wilfried was found in uniform, roughly four days of walking distance away from his post. He did not offer resistance when confronted, and confessed to abandoning his station. The penalty for desertion are the gallows." It's a harsh society we live in, thought Iovinus as he allowed the guardsgriff to explain himself.\n\n"Your majesty—" Wrong form of address, but irrelevant. "—I was not deserting. After the last war, I heard that my family's home was torched by Erian marauders. I simply had to reassure myself that it was not the case, and thank Boreas it wasn't. I asked several times for a leave and it was denied each time, there was no intention to desert." At least, Vincent didn't ruin this griff's life, but that hardly alleviated the gruff captain.\n\n"You dishonour everygriffon who serves the Sunlight Shield, Wilfried. Do you think you're alone in having family?" But before the accused could retort, another quipped in.\n\n"Do we not know the meaning of mercy? It cannot be forgotten even during times of war." Verena in her distinctive garb raised voice from beyond Iovinus' sight. "Our soldiers must be given the opportunity to tend to their loved ones."\n\n"This does not concern you, Prelate—", harsh was Roman's tone, "—and you have no right to meddle in temporal affairs. I would suggest that you keep to your proselytising elsewhere." Iovinus was quick to defuse the argument, as this was a place of dignity, and declared his judgement."
eyrie.23.a:0 ""You are sentenced to the gallows.""
eyrie.23.b:0 ""Forgiveness, and give all soldiers a day off.""
eyrie.23.c:0 ""His weekly wage is forfeit to the House.""

eyrie.24.t:0 "Daggers Gleaming"
eyrie.24.d:0 "Something was amiss. The vassals always had the right of convening the Ducal Court, but it was something they weren't fond of doing, lest they received another browbeating from Iovinus. But today was different and thus he was waiting in the grand palace's throne room as it slowly filled up. In the crowd he saw many important griffs, the heads of houses Bördsdorff, Freud, zu Falkendorff, Weingut... and of course, house Eitelkeit.\n\nThe mystery didn't take long to unravel as the Guard-Captain took the stand. "Edler Herr, we the Adel are severely concerned with your recent actions. Thus we are giving you one chance to correct this mistake: follow our advice or there'll be blood." The rest stood together, their expressions stern and not at all interested in a compromise.\n\nWords failed to leave Iovinus' beak. It didn't seem there was a way out of this, and if there was any support for him, it was not present in the room. He wished, he sorely wished, in a grand display of anger and spite, to put their threat to a test... but he hated Vincent more than he was angry at these traitors right now. To say nothing of the impact this will have in the future, if they actually prevailed in the Struggle. Sad as it was, there was no choice but to agree."
eyrie.24.a:0 ""Fine.""

eyrie.25.t:0 "Court Adjourned"
eyrie.25.d:0 "Just when the Duke was starting to get restless from sitting so much on his backside, there finally came relief. "This session of the Ducal Court has come to an end." Thus loudly proclaimed the herald, and relieved expressions could be seen far and wide. Except on those who didn't reach the front of the line, and ended up being roughly escorted from the premises. They'll have to try again in a few months.\n\nAll in all, Iovinus felt mostly satisfied with the outcomes. He did what he considered to be most just, and there was no commotion like the dreaded last time. The memory still lingered painfully in the mind... But enough of that, there was a most splendid roast waiting in the dining hall, his favourite! Just what he needed after a long day of work, and there were plenty more of those to come."

eyrie.26.t:0 "Our Valuable Possessions"
eyrie.26.d:0 "The Duke of Eyrie was many things, but one of the things he took pride in was his love of the aesthetics. Paintings, sculptures, coinage, ancient instruments, and even jewellery: whatever pleased the eye was precious to Iovinus. Of course, he was aware of not letting his weakness control him and thus only spent on such when he could reasonably afford them. Most of the time...\n\nThus it made it all harder that he was now deciding what to pack away to be sold. Iovinus hoped it would set an example for the others, but the sad truth was that the conflict needed to be funded one way or the other. This particular one was simply the least demanding for the others, but that didn't make it any easier for him as he placed a shroud over a particularly dusty painting, mentally beating himself for letting it lay forgotten in a basement.\n\nOne particular item caught his attention. It was a simple silver goblet, decorated with a tree motif over its surface, with a precious gemstone embedded in the middle. Hardly the most valuable piece of a dragon's hoard, but what made it so sentimental is that it was Corinna's gift for their ten years of marriage together. Oh the happier times...\n\nIt had to go, but maybe he could get it back later on. Iovinus was friends with a reputable dealer in arts, so perhaps she would keep it stashed till he could buy it again. But first, he had to decide on what exactly would he spend all these future idols into."

Spending much of the night unable to sleep, thinking about his family, his legacy, his beautiful Verenia. Sitting at his desk, writing a letter intended for his wife, he would finally succumb to his exhaustion.\n\nA quiet creak could be heard, followed by silence.\n\nThe soft noise would be enough to wake him up, but what he saw then exposed just how insignificant he was. A figure stood before him, black as the sky outside and as silent as the room around them. The shrouded griff looked off, almost blurry and unfocused, like it was trying to be multiple things at once. Its presence made the Duke feel warm and peaceful, yet nervous, frightened. It would reach with a long, desiccated arm, opening its claw to Iovinus. He looked at it with confusion, briefly glancing at the figure's face. There was nothing, just a slow nod and a whisper.\n\n"It could be your time."\n\nWhat time? He already spent most of his lifetime wasting under his burdens. If only it would all end already so he didn't have to worry anymore. His mind was telling him to reject anything the figure offered, but... He was so tired of everything."

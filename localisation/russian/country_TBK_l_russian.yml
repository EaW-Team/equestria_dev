### Starting Tree ###
 
TBK_art_of_the_deal: "The Art of the Deal"
TBK_art_of_the_deal_desc: "Some ponies would consider the finest art to be the graceful brushstrokes that inhabit a painter's canvas, or maybe the soothing harmonies that fill the walls of a concert hall with on performance night; but for arms dealers Pea Shooter and Vasile Cel Tradat, there is no greater art in the world than the art of the deal."
 
TBK_facade_of_democracy: "The Facade of Democracy"
TBK_facade_of_democracy_desc: "It's an open secret in Tobuck that the government and its stated "democracy" are just an elaborate sham to garner support from nations like Maregypt, when in reality much of the country is governed by authoritarian warlords, and democratically elected officials have little power."
 
TBK_grease_the_wheel: "Greasing the Wheel of Democracy"
TBK_grease_the_wheel_desc: "Even though the elected government holds little power, simply subverting them by use of force would be inexcusable in both the eyes of the people and friendly regimes; as such it sometimes requires a little bit of bribery and blackmail to convince government bureaucrats to sign off on risky legislature, and smile while doing it."

TBK_convincing_legislature: "Pass the Home Act"
TBK_convincing_legislature_desc: "The republic is nothing if not cooperative, especially regarding the Zarantians. It’s only fair, and practical of course, to allow for the free movement of peoples over the Tobuckian-Zarantian border; with a little luck, this should keep the tribes off of our backs for a while longer too."

TBK_expand_republican_guard: "Expand Guard Jurisdiction"
TBK_expand_republican_guard_desc: "If the events of the past few months have proven anything, it’s that we must allow the national guard jurisdiction over the movement of peoples. We must keep the Zarantian intellectuals in the city, and of course make sure that the warlords remain blissfully ignorant for a little longer."

TBK_nascent_bureaucracy: "Clean the House"
TBK_nascent_bureaucracy_desc: "The time has come to tidy up around the edges and make doubly sure that nothing compromising leaks out about our little game. It might increase the workload for the state bureaucrats that are trustworthy just a little, but that’s a horseshoe they’ll simply have to wear. Sometimes a little encouragement is unfortunately necessary."

TBK_hope_tobuck: "Three Hurrahs For Tobuck"
TBK_hope_tobuck_desc: "A little glimmer of hope, no matter how far-off the end goal is or how misplaced that hope may be, is still something that can be utilized for the benefit of our little operation. The people must believe in the republic to make the most of the state structure it provides and so they shall, however briefly."

TBK_meet_giggle_juice: "The Loveable Drunk"
TBK_meet_giggle_juice_desc: "While effectively a puppet, one of the most important ponies in Tobuck's democracy is a pony named Giggle Juice. A drunkard who lacks actual power, but makes up for it with an abundance of charisma; he's a popular figurehead in the eyes of many, and his support is paramount to maintaining the facade of Democracy." 

TBK_parlay_vasile: "Erstwhile Partner"
TBK_parlay_vasile_desc: "Ah, Vasile; a griffon as capable of holding a genuine conversation with someone as he is with robbing any poor creature blind on the spot. We would do well to reaffirm our ties with him as he has other plans for this city, though he knows little of it. Perhaps he may even help us unknowingly!"

TBK_zarantia_peace_speech: "Peace and Prosperity"
TBK_zarantia_peace_speech_desc: "Giggle Juice recently came to us with an idea for giving a speech on coexistence and cooperation with the Zarantians, even suggesting that we invite their tribal leader if she’s interested. Let us arrange for this plan of his to forward; even if our neighbours don’t accept, our people will appreciate the gesture."

TBK_early_pay_day: "Their Pay Day"
TBK_early_pay_day_desc: "After thoroughly touching base with everypony that props up our make-believe democracy, it's time for them to reap the benefits of their loyalty. After all, we want it to be pretty clear that allegiance is an investment that pays dividends."

TBK_our_pay_day: "Our Pay Day"
TBK_our_pay_day_desc: "The rules have been set, the sellers regulated and the offshore accounts maintained. We're fit to rake in cash for as long as our supply lasts, come Tatarus or high water."

TBK_thanks_for_bits: "Goodbye, And Thanks For the Bits"
TBK_thanks_for_bits_desc: "We’ve finished up earlier than expected, much to the imminent delight of that tribal queen. Well, better be off whilst the going’s good as they say; there’s no point in delaying our stay in Tobuck any further than necessary. The climate was far from enjoyable and the politics will not be missed."

TBK_pr_campaign: "To The Citizens of Tobuck!"
TBK_pr_campaign_desc: "There are few things more effective than propaganda these days, but we prefer to call that sort of project a ‘media campaign’ when we take it to the public. Whatever the case, calming the people and the soldiers in the warlord armies is a logical step in ensuring the stability of the state for the moment."

TBK_please_listen: "Do Not Believe Their Lies!"
TBK_please_listen_desc: "It seems that our previous efforts, though extensive, simply weren’t enough to sufficiently quell popular discontent and the army remains sceptical. We’ll simply have to make their other sources of information entirely invalid then! We’ll make sure that they don’t trust anypony but us when it comes to the media!"

TBK_to_each_their_game: "To Each Their Game"
TBK_to_each_their_game_desc: "A free market is good for business, but there is a such thing as it being too free. With a little bookkeeping and regulation we can ensure that only loyal liaisons and captains are shipping our guns around, and that none of them are sold to local warlords that could try to muscle in on the trade."

TBK_checking_the_supply: "Checking the Supply"
TBK_checking_the_supply_desc: "Given how messy things currently are in the weapon-selling department, we would do well to streamline the process somewhat. With a little estimation on our part, a few approximations from the warehouse workers and a healthy dose of paperwork it should become much easier to maintain and utilise the stores."

TBK_quality_products: "Quality Products"
TBK_quality_products_desc: "One of the most important things an arms dealer maintains is his reputation. Sell defective arms to a customer one too many times and you may as well consider yourself out of a job. On the other hoof, certain firearms are precisely hunted for their qualities, whenever exceptional or historical. It'd be a waste to sell them off to a common buyer and leave a wealthy patron miffed."

TBK_business_of_gun_running: "The Business of Gun Running"
TBK_business_of_gun_running_desc: "Arms trafficking is the bread and butter of Tobuck. It's why the government was founded, how it's funded, why it's leaders even care, and ultimately the glue that binds Tobuckian society together. On top of all that, it makes us extremely rich!" 

TBK_meeting_the_banker: "Meeting With the Banker"
TBK_meeting_the_banker_desc: "One of the most important part of Tobuck's gun trade is offshore bank accounts; Tobuck is not a state with a stable economy. Storing our accumulated wealth in local banks is just asking for it to be lost with the next financial crisis, which is why it's important to regularly meet with overseas bankers to maintain foreign accounts."
 
TBK_performance_review: "Performance Review"
TBK_performance_review_desc: "With ample use of auditors and statisticians, we can actually get to the business of determining if all of our hard work has actually paid off in the end, or if we've just wasted our time with bad business."

TBK_streamlined_procurement: "Streamlined Procurement"
TBK_streamlined_procurement_desc: "To be blunt, we need to speed things up a little. What we have in place works, but it doesn’t work nearly well enough to last. Though it will pain the coffers to do so, it’s important that we increase the number of working personnel on the weapon stockpiles and begin properly managing the warehouses that we keep them in."

TBK_eye_on_warlords: "The Three Warlords"
TBK_eye_on_warlords_desc: "Though the warlords guarantee our safety from outside forces, they also present the most significant security threat. If they were to discover the deal then they would quickly become hostile and would certainly have the military capacity to take over for themselves. We must watch our backs, wait and play along."

TBK_celebrate_military_success: "Celebrate Military Success"
TBK_celebrate_military_success_desc: "As Wallnut Drive would say, there’s nothing like a party to remind yourself why it is that you do what you do. Though they haven’t done much recently, the warlords would very much enjoy some shipments of various foodstuffs and booze to keep themselves occupied until we’re ready to get out."

TBK_rules_gun_running: "The Rules of Good Business"
TBK_rules_gun_running_desc: "When it comes to gun running there are some things you should always do and others that would probably get you killed if you were to have a go at them. These rules must be followed to a tee, unless we plan on ending up ousted like the Zarantians. If nothing else, the threat of retrospective irony is simply too great."

TBK_first_rule: "First Rule"
TBK_first_rule_desc: "First rule is to never get shot with your own merchandise. Sell it unloaded, and sell it to people way out of killing range. Wallnut Drive is a true oddball compared to the other warlords, someone who seems to find new ways to break guns and expend ammunition."

TBK_tricky_thestral: "The Tricky Thestral"
TBK_tricky_thestral_desc: "Wallnut Drive is not the smartest bat, but he has a way of showing up just when you don't need him to. If given the right incentives, he'll cause enough chaos and confusion on his own that the others won't realize the game until it's already up."

TBK_second_rule: "Second Rule"
TBK_second_rule_desc: "Second rule is to never pick up arms with your customers. Baragzen, the snobby Warzenan noble, has far greater ambitions than any other warlord in Tobuck, only outmatched by his boorish smugness. But passion like his, if harnessed well, makes for a good tool."

TBK_exiled_royal: "The Exiled Royal"
TBK_exiled_royal_desc: "Baragzen sees Tobuck as just a stepping stone to future conquests. Let him think that way. We'll give him some extra guns and tell him the other warlords are looking to muscle in on his territory, and he'll keep them off our backs."

TBK_third_rule: "Third Rule"
TBK_third_rule_desc: "Third rule is to always ensure you have a foolproof way of getting paid, preferably in advance. If you don't have a guaranteed way to get your cash in the end, the deal isn't worth it. Alesia Snezhnaya is a smart mare and careful with her goods. But give her a good deal and she'll make a good business partner."

TBK_white_severyana: "The White Severyanian"
TBK_white_severyana_desc: "Alesia Snezhnaya is dogged and determined, but thinks linearly. If we hoof her some extra troops and tell her to fortify the border, she'll be too busy scrupulously digging trenches to snoop around."

TBK_failure_operation: "Erstwhile Operation"
TBK_failure_operation_desc: "Desperate times call for desperate measures, so the media says at least. The warlords have been encouraged to launch an operation against Chiropterra, working off of entirely falsified reports of a weak border presence there. Knowing their drive for loot, they’ll likely commit fully to the attack and need to reoperate afterwards."

TBK_provoke_battles: "Tobuckian Standoff"
TBK_provoke_battles_desc: "We’re in a position now where we can encourage the warlords to fight one another, if only to give us a little more time. Pea has dirt on all three of the big equines that should be just enough to get them into a scuffle, we’ll just have to make sure that they don’t start sniffing around once the damage is done."

### Vasile tree

TBK_vasile_start: "To Save the Republic"
TBK_vasile_start_desc: "Well that was a mess. Pea's off. Zarantia's angrier than they ever have been and the warlords are running amok in the countryside. But while you can see some smugglers running to the ships in Tobuck's harbour, there is a griff in the presidential palace who still sees an opportunity. After all, who better to thrive in chaos than a Brodfeldian?"

TBK_take_loans: "Grovel For Loans"
TBK_take_loans_desc: "Pea drained the whole treasury dry to fund his escape. Whatever he made it out with is gone and so is the rest. At this point, we'll have to bite the bullet and borrow at loan shark rates but it beats austerity. Nothing is more unstable than corrupt civil servants getting told to make do with less."

TBK_crash_cuts: "Crash Cuts"
TBK_crash_cuts_desc: "Whoever said that you have to spend money to make money was not in the gun running business. While you can haggle with some ponies, you can't expect to go far with the loan shark breathing down your neck. Anyway, everypony takes a squeeze and be a little patient. If you want guarantees and security, go plant potatoes!"

TBK_support_zarantian_businesses: "Entice the Zarantians"
TBK_support_zarantian_businesses_desc: "Throughout Pea's regime, we took very little care in giving a reason for the Zarantian-aligned families not to hate us. Considering Pea's end game, it was no surprise but Vasile had nonetheless made some business overtures. By reaching out, we could build a relationship off of that. And once we're in, we can work things out."

TBK_blame_pea: "Everything Is Pea's Fault!"
TBK_blame_pea_desc: "Pea Shooter was a fantastic gun smuggler but he really mucked it up for the rest of us. We'll be lucky if we manage to really turn things around. Luckily, the Tobuckians feel the same way. So we might as well pin everything on him. He's far away and not planning to come back. He'll understand. Probably."

TBK_blame_giggle: "And Giggle's Too!"
TBK_blame_giggle_desc: "Giggle Juice was an amazing tool for a while when Pea's crew was still getting money and some good partying was enough to smooth the edges. But now, we're going to go through a rough patch and nothing gets on the nerves of everypony than a drunk who can't get up before noon. Time to sober up."

TBK_vasile_president: "Emergency Elections"
TBK_vasile_president_desc: "For all of its short history, the Republic of Tobuck never made good on its promise of organising elections. So let's. We'll have to be quick about it so no opposition can organise. Also, we'll need to raid the pantries to buy votes with something else than money. Hey you! Want a pound of flour in exchange for a vote?"

TBK_restore_legitimacy: "Bring Back Stability"
TBK_restore_legitimacy_desc: "For a little while, we have been able to keep the rowdiest elements of our mercenaries and smugglers in check. Now, they're running wild and anypony turning to the state needs to pay up to even get listened to. It's time to bring back some order and show them that maybe there's hope under the striped flag. At the very least, it'll buy us time to figure things out."

TBK_reform_and_expand_republican_guard: "Arm the Republican Guard"
TBK_reform_and_expand_republican_guard_desc: "The Republic Guard has never been much more than a ponyguard force dedicated to prevent the warlords from bullying the capital itself. It is time to give them the tools to do more and actually stand up to the warlords when the time is right. We have the guns. Time to give them to the right ponies this time around."

TBK_keep_some_servants: "Keep Some Bureaucrats"
TBK_keep_some_servants_desc: "Vasile and Pea paid a whole lot of ponies throughout their partnership. Sadly, both indulged in some favoritism, especially when Pea's plan became clear. The people wants corrupt heads to fall. Might as well give them what they want with Pea's loyalists and make sure we get to keep the loyal ones who know what they're doing."

TBK_cull_civil_servants: "Sweep the Slate Clean"
TBK_cull_civil_servants_desc: "For all its usefulness for our business venture, the corrupt apparel of state was a really nothing more than a temporary boon. It's a rotten base for anything long-term. We need to remove all of the corrupt civil servants and make sure those with real inside knowledge shut up permanently. Plus, this will be a wonderful opportunity to garner good among the people."

TBK_fight_warlords: "Act Swiftly and Fiercely"
TBK_fight_warlords_desc: "It's been months now that the three idiots and other new wannabe idiots have been ducking it out in the countryside to be in a prime position to take Tobuck. In a way, they made our job for us. Time to go out and mop them up before the bats or Zarantians get the idea of doing it first. Citizens, to arms! Or something like that. We're learning."

TBK_vasile_inaguration_speech: "Father of the Fatherland"
TBK_vasile_inaguration_speech_desc: "The votes have been counted and the elected parliament of Tobuck can finally gather. Thanks to our diligence, it's only a formality and Vasile Cel Tradat shall be confirmed as president of the Republic. It's time to address the people. Fear not, little foals of Tobuck. Vasile's here. And he'll take good care of you. We promise."

TBK_legimate_republic: "Republic of the People"
TBK_legimate_republic_desc: "You know what? If we are to make this republican thing work, we might as well walk the walk. Well. Up to a point. But still, we can find a way to make things work for the people and for us. In addition, it would finally allow us to make good on our plan to give us a presentable facade for the harmonic and established powers. After all, all facades are better with an actual building behind it."

But now, we'll have to provide for our own defense to fend off any attackers. Vasile has the will to do it. But how to go about it? That is the million bit question."

TBK_raise_extra_troops: "Call Upon the People"
TBK_raise_extra_troops_desc: "With the promise of a more respectable republic, we can start recruiting among the general population without fear of angering our military leaders. With a decent pay, we can even hope that enough will answer the call to fill up our ranks. It'll take time of course to build a standing army capable of defending Tobuck but it'll be ours. Plus, we know how to find enough guns to make even the lowest recruit a threat."

TBK_rally_front: "Together For Victory!"
TBK_rally_front_desc: "Gone are the days of the warlords and mercenaries. You won't be fighting so Pea Shooter can loot you for longer but for a square deal. Everypony gets their share. We're fighting for our homes and our families. This is Tobuck and it is not for sale! So gather around and grab a gun."

TBK_bat_forts: "The Western Trenches"
TBK_bat_forts_desc: "Chief among our threatening neighbours stands Chiropterra in the west. With Wallnut Drive's luck and tactics gone, we need to find new ways to counter them. Fortunately, we do have some veterans whose experience we can use. But considering the size of Tobuck, we have no other choice than to dig and entrench ourselves to start. Here's a shovel."

TBK_bat_defence: "Together Against the Bat Menace"
TBK_bat_defence_desc: "You know what's worse than smugglers, warlords and corruption? Bats. They're crazy, they're evil and they hate anything even remotely pleasurable. It's been a thousand years and they're still not over their insane alicorn mother issues. They'll ban sunlight and ask you to thank them for it. So choose wisely. Choose the lesser evil. Choose Tobuck."

TBK_hire_additional_mercs: "Hire the Band of Flayers"
TBK_hire_additional_mercs_desc: "We need forces loyal to the new republic in order to stabilize our still fragile rule, and to get the Chiropterrans off our backs. While we want to phase out the use of mercenaries and warlords eventually, we need to bring in some new muscle to keep the peace. The barbaric "Band of Flayers" and their fearsome reputation, including rumors of skinning victims, will be the perfect force to scare those fanatics off."

TBK_use_merc_experiences: "Utilize Mercenary Experiences"
TBK_use_merc_experiences_desc: "You know what's great about mercenaries? They know how to kill things. They'll tell you about it.

Now if only they would pick up after themselves."

TBK_criminal_republic: "Republic of Riches"
TBK_criminal_republic_desc: "All the way back when the striped flag was raised over Tobuck, Vasile felt in his bones that this was a good hustle. Not in the way Pea had envisioned.

TBK_vasile_post_bat_legimate: "Our Triumphant Republic" ###Nidwt
TBK_vasile_post_bat_legimate_desc: "It's over. The bats are in disarray and Vasile stands triumphant, our president-conqueror. In just a few years, we transformed a fake republic into a model for Zebrica, a profitable democracy, and now, we'll do it again for the fanatics! We're not the emotional type but it does bring a tear to your eye. Take that Kemerskai!"

TBK_bat_break_faith: "What Did Wallnut Say Again?" ###Nidwt
TBK_bat_break_faith_desc: "From the beginning, we've had a window, if a bit of a foggy one, into how Chiropterra operates and what we've seen is not pretty. And that's us saying that so you catch the drift. If left alone, the madness will bite us in the tail. We need to neuter the Moonspeaker operation and make sure that from this day forward, they'll be shooting blanks even on a full moon!"

TBK_bat_leave_mommy_issues_be: "Just... Leave Faith Be" ###Nidwt
TBK_bat_leave_mommy_issues_be_desc: "Look. They've been weird about it for a thousand years so maybe it's better that we just find a way to accommodate it all. Maybe teach them a few lessons about healthy management of expectations and pick up something like painting. We'll just make sure the Moonspeakers don't get too murderous. That'll be a start."

TBK_bat_peaceful: "Chill and Eat Mangoes" ###Nidwt
TBK_bat_peaceful_desc: "Religion is obviously a root issue of why Chiropterra acted the way it did. However, we can't just ignore the result of a millennia of cultural stiffness. We need to sell to the bats the idea that there is more to life than war and moon, that they can just have fun. And we know a thing or two about how to sell something to a pony."

TBK_bat_moneys: "Tributes of the Moon" ###Nidwt
TBK_bat_moneys_desc: "The Chiropterra war has been a costly endeavour and they've long caused untold sorrow and property damages. It's high time that they start paying reparations to those they've harmed. Well, to us for a start. Let's not upset the hierarchy of creditors. We don't forget our brave veterans or those who provided them with the tools of war."

TBK_bat_determine_guilt: "Guilty, Not Guilty..." ###Nidwt
TBK_bat_determine_guilt_desc: "Throughout its history, Chiropterra has committed so much crime it's not even funny anymore. And that's just according to their archives. So if we want to make sure the angry victims are calmed down, we'll need to go through all of it and figure out who gets a bullet, a cell, a ticket to wherever or slapped with a fine and hoof so we can call it a day."

TBK_bat_old_stooges_new_management: "Old System, New Management" ###Nidwt
TBK_bat_old_stooges_new_management_desc: "Look, Canterlot wasn't built in a day and we don't have a millenia on our hooves. We barely managed to build a republic once and that was without a cult to deal with. So we'll do the best thing a good leader can do: passing the buck! Er, I mean delegate to the right ponies and let them figure all that stuff out. They'll manage."

TBK_bat_democracy: "Traditional-Moon Party" ###Nidwt
TBK_bat_democracy_desc: "Look, we know. But that one has been such a winning brand, we can't just go and not use it. In all honesty, the TMP has a nice ring to it and they need some reassurance that no, we're not trying to besiege the gates of the moon. Also, they're paying us anyway so we might as well give them a little something for all the royalties we're getting."

TBK_bat_chiropterra_republic: "New Lunar Republic" ###Nidwt
TBK_bat_chiropterra_republic_desc: "President Vasile never meant to conquer and occupy foreign land, merely to liberate them and put an end to a criminal regime. Now, the new and improved Lunar Republic stands proud in Chiropterra, ready to engage with the world in good faith and absolutely no trace of terrorism. Ain't that swell? Why is there somepony wheezing in the back?"

TBK_vasile_popular_autocracy: "Vasile the Victorious" ###Nidwt
TBK_vasile_popular_autocracy_desc: "As the sun rises over the dank Chiropterran hills, president Vasile stands alone and victorious and yet, some still have some doubts about him. Why? Hasn't he achieved the impossible? We have had so much success it's starting to get physically painful. Especially for our enemies. Poor them. So let's party. Lack of gratitude is best handled the morning after."

TBK_centralize_presidency: "One And Only President" ###Nidwt
TBK_centralize_presidency_desc: "The road to our current success was a bumpy ones, with all kinds of needs to compromise, play nice and prove ourselves. Well, we've proven ourselves and it is high time that ponies stop pretending like president Vasile doesn't deserve his place. How about you all prove yourselves to him? What have you ever done for Tobuck?!"

TBK_who_saved_you: "Who Saved You?" ###Nidwt
TBK_who_saved_you_desc: "We've spend so much time fighting for our lives that we have not really told the story of how it all went down. But in the end. Where was Tobuck when president Vasile took over? Surrounded by bloodthirsty enemies, torn apart by warlords and looted by a criminal. So ask yourselves, all the critics, how did we get here from there?"

TBK_who_made_you_wealthy: "Who Made You Rich?" ###Nidwt
TBK_who_made_you_wealthy_desc: "It is true that Tobuck has always been well-developed but that wealth was always built on playing second fiddle for foreign rulers by families with little pride in their own people. So what did the Brodfeldian do? He did not export the wealth, he expanded it right here. He made Tobuck rich on its own terms and it's all trickling down back to you all."

TBK_sideline_harmonists: "What´s Good In Friendship?" ###Nidwt
TBK_sideline_harmonists_desc: "What did the harmonists ever do for you? Did they feed you when you were hungry? Did they stand against Chiropterra when they loomed over us? Did they provide you with jobs? No. All they do is chatter and bicker about the right of law. Well, the law says Vasile Cel Tradat is the president of the republic and the law is right."

TBK_i_am_republic: "I Am the Republic" ###Nidwt
TBK_i_am_republic_desc: "There, we said our piece and we're not hearing any retort. This concludes our national debate. So if you didn't pay attention, here's the main takeaway. This Republic rests upon the president's mighty shoulders and you all better be afraid of what would happen if Vasile Cel Tradat ever shrugged! Thanks for listening and get back to work."

TBK_symbols_presidency: "Idol of the Republic" ###Nidwt
TBK_symbols_presidency_desc: "A great problem in Tobuck is that it never had a real story of its own, symbols or a mythology to explain why it is so great. In a way, it lacks a brand. And who better than president Vasile to be the face of it? So let's codify the presidency and elevate his game changing achievements. We'll call it all Vasilism. Sure rhymes with patriotism."

TBK_final_arbitrator: "Now You Sit and\n Listen To Me" ###Nidwt
TBK_final_arbitrator_desc: "We've had to compromise way too much for too little gain during the early years of the presidency. We let the opposition in parliament and the media sling dirt at anypony. But in the end, it was our great president Vasile who lead us to victory and prosperity. So let's cut to the chase and listen. You all might learn a thing or two!"

TBK_supreme_protector: "Hear My Pledge" ###Nidwt
TBK_supreme_protector_desc: "The candidate is chosen and Vasile's place in Tobuck's national myth is enshrined. So it may be time for the president to address the nation and to explain what his role is. That of a father, a father who knows that it's time for his little foals to spread their wings, to trot out of the nest and fly into the sunset. Ok, we'll keep working on that but the gist is there."

TBK_prime_minister_idea: "Perhaps I Work Too Much?" ###Nidwt
TBK_prime_minister_idea_desc: "You know what? One can in fact suffer from success. There is something about open leadership that just drains you. Perhaps it's time to look for an heir. Well, at least a new face to throw at the press so the president can focus on the good thing in life : prestige, money and business. Preferably all at once."

TBK_perfect_servant: "My Most Loyal Aide" ###Nidwt
TBK_perfect_servant_desc: "Vasile Cel Tradat has been a great president and achieved much. Nopony can deny that, especially not the one who wrote it all down. So who better to take the reins than his secretary? Bean Counter, the shy little pony who crunched the numbers for so many reforms. The good thing is that he's used to taking orders so he'll do great."

TBK_establish_office_prime_minister: "Congratulations\nPrime Minister!" ###Nidwt
TBK_establish_office_prime_minister_desc: "Now that we've done some spring cleaning, it's high time to make things official. So congratulations, Bean Counter! You are now the head of government, serving at the president's leisure and responsible before parliament. And if it doesn't work out, Vasile will dismiss and replace him. That's how it works in a democracy, right? "

TBK_democratic_principles: "Soul of the State" ###Nidwt
TBK_democratic_principles_desc: "Tobuck is a republic but it's always been run on promises and Vasile's careful maneuvering. However, it's not enough to walk the walk, the people wants to hear the right words too. So it's time to enshrine the principles of liberty and democracy within our constitution. With some guardrails of course. Don't want the crazies storming into office, now do we?"

TBK_tcp_supremacy: "Forwards Tobuck, Follow the TCP!" ###Nidwt
TBK_tcp_supremacy_desc: "Vasile has done a lot for the nation but in truth, it was always a team effort. And that team is the Traditional Center Party. The TCP stands for liberty, for democracy, for prosperity and for victory! Bean Counter is the party chancellor and Vasile Cel Tradat its esteemed founder! So get in or get lost! Er, I mean, get in for Tobuck! Hurray."

TBK_tcp_propaganda: "There Is No Tobuck Without the TCP!" ###Nidwt
TBK_tcp_propaganda_desc: "The party has never been the most active. So time to shake things up if we're going to make it for election day. Get your fat tails out of your sofas and start campaigning! Ring some bells, shake hooves and smile! Don't know how to do that? Grab some pamphlets and give them out! No, you're not getting paid for this! Your job is on the line!"

TBK_electoral_gamble: "Luck Never Dies" ###Nidwt
TBK_electoral_gamble_desc: "The harmonic opposition constantly rants and rave about a free and fair election. And you know what? We're in. Let's do this. Let's have an election. A fair one. A quick one. What do they even have to offer that we don't? We've got the money, we've got the results, we've got the best candidate. Then again, it's a gamble but eh, we got this."

TBK_meet_opposition: "Shake Claw With Rose" ###Nidwt
TBK_meet_opposition_desc: "Rose Rain. Leader of the Harmonic Front. It was such a cute idea that, allegedly, Pea Shooter sent a fruit basket when she had her first public meeting. However, she did manage to win over some ponies and is formally the head of our opposition. If we're going to make the people buy into this election, it's time to acknowledge her."

TBK_formalize_election_rigging: "One Citizen,\nOne Vote" ###Nidwt
TBK_formalize_election_rigging_desc: "On paper, an election is something that is extremely simple. You vote and whoever gets the most votes wins. However, even the worst student of political science could tell you that there are finer details that can alter the outcome of an election and that the definition of winning is relative. We agree. So let's get to work on this"

TBK_citizen_fears: "Only Vasile Protects Your Interests, Citizen!" ###Nidwt
TBK_citizen_fears_desc: "You know. Ponies are not really that dumb. They know that Vasile has some unsavory dealings here and there. But what about Rose? What was she doing? And what of the other candidates? All these politicians, do we know what they were doing during Pea's days? Meanwhile, you know Vasile and things are good. But the others? Can you trust them?"

TBK_sham_electoral_victory: "Three Hurrays To Victory" ###Nidwt
TBK_sham_electoral_victory_desc: "Alright. Election day. What a blast this campaign has been. President cel Tradat has toured the nation with great success but now comes the moment of truth. I know we've stacked the deck but I'm starting to feel that the harmonists are onto something with this whole election thing. I HAVE NEVER FELT THIS ALIVE!"

TBK_entry_world_stage: "Enter the World" ###Nidwt

They can't be any preachier than Equestria, right?"

TBK_maregypt_deal: "In the Land of Pyramids" ###Nidwt
TBK_maregypt_deal_desc: "They say that a long time ago, Maregyptian settlers founded Tobuck.

They say curiosity killed the cat but they never said anything about profitable financial speculation."

TBK_equestria_recognition: "Are We Legitimate Yet?" ###Nidwt
TBK_equestria_recognition_desc: "We've cleaned up our act, destroyed the biggest bastion of anti-Equestrian terrorists in history and brought prosperity to the northwestern zebrican peninsula. And yet, Equestria still won't recognize us! It's time to put our hoof down and request what we are owed: basic respect for our people. Also, access to their massive pool of capital. Mostly that."

TBK_zarantia_recourse: "No Hard Feelings Zarantia?" ###Nidwt
TBK_zarantia_recourse_desc: "So what if we offered you a deal you couldn't refuse and then asked you to shove it where the sun don't shine? That was all Pea Shooter and now we're brand new.

If there's one thing Wallnut Drive knows, it's that they must be stopped."

TBK_aristocrat_servants_desc: "There are a selection of upper-class citizens in Manerba that used to be part of Warzenan noble society before outside forces stripped them of their titles and land. We shall grant them titles and establish a court here in Tobuck with their assistance."

TBK_loyal_local_zarantians_desc: "The time has come to instill the populace and their local leaders with a sense of loyalty. We shall 'encourage' them to make oaths and pledges for the sake of service to Baragzen in whatever capacity he deems fit and proper."

TBK_remind_of_loyalty: "Reminder About Loyalty" #Garion
TBK_remind_of_loyalty_desc: "Fear is a very important tool, one that an experienced warlord like Baragzen understands very well. Examples will be made of a small number of known dissidents so that those with a desire to resist fear action against those of true royal blood."

TBK_merchant_tobuck: "The Merchant of Tobuck" #Garion
TBK_merchant_tobuck_desc: "Vasile is well known in Tobuck's business circles and was seemingly uninvolved in Pea Shooter's plot to sell the region back to Zarantia. We shall make proper use of his incredible economic expertise and grant him a position of administration over the city of Tobuck itself."

TBK_new_princely_guard: "The Oath Wardens" #Garion
TBK_new_princely_guard_desc: "Ancient legends tell of these soldiers, dutiful guards of Warzenan rulers. Such an idea is well suited to the exiled lord who is very much in need of protection and loyalty in this turbulent time for Tobuck. The legends shall once again have their names etched into history."

TBK_guard_recruitment: "Only the Finest Soldiers" #Garion
TBK_guard_recruitment_desc: "Mercenaries are no longer an appropriate name for Baragzen's finest soldiery. Though their reputation and skill arose from the lowest of the low, so did his legitimacy as ruler; it is only fitting that their discipline be drilled and reinforced by the Oath Wardens."

TBK_blood_warzena: "Blood of the Leopard" #Garion
TBK_blood_warzena_desc: "The Leopard bloodline in the Warzenan dynasties is an ancient and powerful one. It is demonstrative of the validity in any individual's claim to the Warzenan throne should such be prove, though Baragzen in particular may lay claim to the nation."

TBK_weak_brother: "The Weakling King" #Garion
TBK_weak_brother_desc: "The current Warzenan monarch is nothing more than a puppet of the hippogriff menace, a false inheritor of a glorious and yet untapped past and nation. We shall decry and denounce that traitor with all the resources available to our administration."

TBK_worthy_king: "The Worthy Heir" #Garion
TBK_worthy_king_desc: "Unlike the puppet monarch who currently sits on the throne, Baragzen is a warrior king like those of old; his claim to the throne is indisputable. We shall make a plublic declaration of our intentions to install the rightful king of Warzena, both to the public and to our enemy."

TBK_i_am_king: "The Abjuration Decree" #Garion
TBK_i_am_king_desc: "Baragzen's first law for the new realm is the Abjuration Decree. All power vested in government officials is to be subsumed by his will and whim, under no circumstances must this rule be ignored. Any remnants of Pea Shooter's republic will be eliminated for good."

TBK_secure_river_border: "The Demarean Embankments" #Garion
TBK_secure_river_border_desc: "Unlike his contemporary warlord commanders, Baragzen expresses no displeasure at the concept of flooding particular areas for the sake of defensive proficiency. If Chiropterra wishes to invade, then they shall meet a well prepared and dangerous foe."

TBK_alesia_start: "The White Severyan" #Garion
TBK_alesia_start_desc: "Through iron will and decisive action, Alesia Snezhnaya has emerged the dominant power in Tobuck. While the other warlords are cowed, she must find one of them to make a pact with and dispose of the other."

TBK_subdue_locals: "Righteous Rule" #Garion
TBK_subdue_locals_desc: "The Severyan tsars of old ruled with justice and fairness, but also cold efficiency. They had no time for foolish things like mercy, or forgiving those who deserved no forgiveness. Alesia will emulate their example, and crush the rebellious scum and the criminals of Tobuck in one swift blow."

TBK_evil_communism: "The Red Beast" #Garion
TBK_evil_communism_desc: "The one saving grace of Tobuck is that the godless venom of communism hasn't infected it. Alesia intends to keep it that way, and to use her new state as a hammer against the ravening red hordes."

TBK_defenders_traditions: "White Druzhina" #Garion
TBK_defenders_traditions_desc: "Now that Alesia has broken the deadlock of smugglers, warlords, and miscreants, she can centralize and discipline this rabble into a proper army. The first step is redistributing Alesia's loyal troops into the ranks of new regiments, where they will serve as instructors and discipline officers. These mixed Severyan-Tobuckian units will be the Druzhina, and the other units should strive to emulate them."

TBK_all_for_defence: "All For Triumph!" #Garion
TBK_all_for_defence_desc: "Resolute stoicism, unyielding determination, uncomplaining sacrifice. These were the values which made Severyana strong before the communist cancer rotted them away, and these are the values Alesia will instill by her example."

TBK_long_from_home: "It's Long Way To Princessyn" #Garion
TBK_long_from_home_desc: "The white exiles are few in number, but every single one of them is worth ten other ponies. Alesia will call upon old contacts and allies among the last true Severyans, and rekindle the dream of a new Severyana among them. One day, we shall return, and bring fire and death to the bloodthirsty beasts who despoil our lands."

TBK_new_exile_regiment: "We Are Severyan Soldiers" #Garion
TBK_new_exile_regiment_desc: "The advantage of coming to power in Tobuck is that it is a cultural blank slate. Thanks to this, we have been able to foster Severyan values of stoicism, sacrifice, hierarchy, and discipline among our soldiers, with no need to uproot an inferior service culture. The tales of Severyan heroes of old shall inspire our troops, and they will show the rabble of this continent what true warfare is!"

TBK_contact_kin: "The Exiled Community" #Garion
TBK_contact_kin_desc: "Alesia was already well-known among the Severyan exiles, and as news of her victory has spread more and more of her compatriots have begun to feel the old flames of patriotism rekindle. Some of the old nobility managed to escape with significant wealth, and now many of them are making generous donations to our cause."

TBK_severyan_family: "Severyana Endures Through Us" #Garion
TBK_severyan_family_desc: "Severyana may have fallen, first to the scheming princess and then to the vile communists, but so long as one true Severyanian draws breath it is not lost. Alesia will rule with the same rigid strength as the tsars of old, and muster her forces until, one day, the true foals of Severyana will return to drive out the parasites who feast on their homeland."

TBK_i_hate_sand_desc: "There is nothing worse than desert warfare. However, given Pea Shooter's machinations we will likely have to face the Zarantian savages sooner rather than later. Alesia has declared that we will construct a line of fortifications along their border, complete with minefields and concealed killzones, such that by the time we step into the desert there will only be corpses waiting for us."

TBK_full_war_economy: "All the Guns and Bullets" #Garion
TBK_full_war_economy_desc: "Our first priority should be getting guns into hooves. We'll use the remainder of the smugglers' ill-gotten-gains to purchase as many weapons as we can find, and scour the city to dredge up its hidden stashes. After that, we'll have to make our own."

TBK_pay_troops: "All Possible Troops" #Garion
TBK_pay_troops_desc: "Our first priority should be to get more hooves to hold guns. We will increase soldiers' pay to incentivize as many to enlist as possible, then extend conscription to make up the difference with draftees."

TBK_new_tobuck: "Death of Tobuck" #Garion
TBK_new_tobuck_desc: "The Republic of Tobuck was a sham state from the start. Few marked its passing, and fewer still will mourn it. It is time to formally bury the republic, so that our new order can begin in earnest."

TBK_liberal_politics:0 "The Common Good"
TBK_liberal_politics_desc:0 "The previous administration wasn’t exactly kind to its inhabitants which, though natural for what can only be described as a thinly-veiled corporatocracy, is far from fair. The federation exists for the benefit of the people, with the assent of the people and with its institutions at the behest of the people."

TBK_brand_new_bureaucracy:0 "Brand-New Bureaucracy"
TBK_brand_new_bureaucracy_desc:0 "Retaining any significant remnant of the old government will end in tears, not least for how impossibly corrupt the whole affair was. If we want to do things better than they did, we need to build the state institutions from the ground up and wipe the old slate clean."

TBK_purge_corruption:0 "War Against Corruption"
TBK_purge_corruption_desc:0 "We must forever be vigilant against the scourge of corruption, lest it take root in the federation as it did in Tobuck once before. Luckily nobody has a pile of guns to make use of this time, but that doesn’t make the state invincible to the vile tendrils of malpractice and embezzling."

TBK_federal_framework:0 "Federal Framework"
TBK_federal_framework_desc:0 "Given the inherent difficulties of unitary administration, a federal framework for governing is the logical next step for our future endeavours. Decentralisation is a necessary facet of modern bureaucracy that simply cannot be overlooked when having to organise a reasonably sized state."

TBK_delegionarization:0 "Delegionarization"
TBK_delegionarization_desc:0 "If the new federal framework is to function, the bottom line is that the system of families and legions must be entirely dismantled. All will be equal citizens within the federation and none will have their future decided by birth or by battle; unless they decide to enlist in the latter case, of course."

TBK_defence_religions_law:0 "Sanctity of Religion Act"
TBK_defence_religions_law_desc:0 "Though secularism is immensely important to the governance of any state, there are many in the federation who worship the Nightmare and other gods like Zal and Zanit. It would be remiss of us not to guarantee the freedom of religion to our citizens, especially given their affection for their deities."

TBK_reparations_law:0 "Reparations Act"
TBK_reparations_law_desc:0 "We cannot allow the destruction of war to alienate the Chiropterrans and drive them away from our Hazrumenian family. To that end it is imperative that we compensate them for the suffering that they endured, painful to the coffers as it may be."

TBK_forgivness_act:0 "To Move Onwards"
TBK_forgivness_act_desc:0 "With amends made and the disparate peoples of our federation closer knit, we can finally claim that all is well with the Chiropterrans. The estranged brother of the Hazrumenian family has finally come home to rest, having made up with their siblings."

TBK_federal_elections:0 "National Elections"
TBK_federal_elections_desc:0 "The time has come to organise the national elections, the best way to elect a new head of state is to vote them in at the top level after all! Now we just have to let everyone know who’s on the ballot and what their tenets in leadership will be. Shouldn’t be too hard, right?"

TBK_local_elections:0 "Local Elections"
TBK_local_elections_desc:0 "The time has come to organise local elections; the best way to run a country is to have the people vote for local representatives and build up from there after all!! Now we just have to let everyone know who’s on the ballot and what their tenets in leadership will be. Shouldn’t be too hard, right?"

TBK_electoral_law:0 "Who Can Run?"
TBK_electoral_law_desc:0 "Carrot stick is a firm believer that anti-democratic parties and individuals shouldn’t be able to run for office, but Rose Rain disagrees. Hopefully they can set aside their differences in the upcoming debate, either that or one of them will take the lead and get their way..."

TBK_democratic_propaganda:0 "ULZ Stands For Democracy"
TBK_democratic_propaganda_desc:0 "If there is one thing that unites all peoples of the federation, it is democracy in Hazrumenia. We are many different cultures, races and hold many different beliefs and loyalties; but our citizens may be united in their say over who leads our great state."

TBK_formal_constitution:0 "Formal Constitution"
TBK_formal_constitution_desc:0 "It’s about time we put pen to paper and wrote ourselves a formal constitution so that we may enshrine the rights of our citizens and provide a legal framework for the courts. It may be somewhat of a daunting task, but it’s not as though it can’t be amended in the future."

TBK_united_police_force:0 "Marshals of Law"
TBK_united_police_force_desc:0 "If there was any one thing that was needed in the republic, it was a half decent police force that was actually capable of protecting the people. It’s high time we got around to constructing a competent force that has the capacity to handle domestic troubles without the help of the army."

TBK_election_day:0 "The First Elections"
TBK_election_day_desc:0 "The day has finally arrived! The elections are here and it’s time to get down to the voting booths to get your votes out! Remember, the ballots are supposed to be secret and it’s our duty to make sure they stay that way!"

TBK_strategic_tactical_division:0 "Special Tactical Directive"
TBK_strategic_tactical_division_desc:0 "The great thing about police forces is that they can really specialise when it comes to training. We can make use of this capacity for further tactical training in establishing a new secret service that will, with a little luck, help us greatly in defending our ever-growing Hazrumenian family."

TBK_democracy_victory:0 "Hurray Wallnut!\nHurray Democracy!"
TBK_democracy_victory_desc:0 "We’ve actually managed to create a successful democracy in a successor state to a sham republic. It’s no surprise that Wallnut and his friends are being celebrated for their work in founding the federation after such a feat as that. Long live democracy! Long live the Generalissimo!"

TBK_old_administrative_framework:0 "The Old Framework"
TBK_old_administrative_framework_desc:0 "Even though it was a corrupt mess, not all of it was inherently broken; the republic just had a lot of bad apples running the show. Keeping some of the old institutions around won’t do us any harm now that we’ve gotten rid of them, we just have to make sure other kleptocrats stay out of office."

TBK_old_civil_knowledge:0 "The Stout Civil Service"
TBK_old_civil_knowledge_desc:0 "Having pruned the old civil service and made sure everything’s running smoothly, we now have a fairly small but particularly efficient bureaucracy that should be able to handle whatever we throw at them. Well, so long as we make sure they stay well paid that is."

TBK_grand_freedoms:0 "Grand Rights of Everycreature"
TBK_grand_freedoms_desc:0 "A comprehensive list of rights for all citizens is a necessity for the continued growth of our Hazrumenian family. It must cover all bases and protect all creatures and their interests, from the lowliest of pauper to the richest business owner. A federation for all!"

TBK_enshrine_democracy:0 "The Cause of Democratic-Harmonism"
TBK_enshrine_democracy_desc:0 "Though harmony may find its origins in benign absolutism of old, the modern ideal of democracy and harmony combined is perhaps the greatest combination of political ideas yet created. We must protect our citizens and their right to a representative and harmonious society!"

TBK_great_public_works:0 "Federal Public Works"
TBK_great_public_works_desc:0 "State funded infrastructure projects are the next step in building and expanding on the existing civilian economy within the federation. Our Hazrumenian family shall prosper for the benefit of every individual within that very family. Onwards and upwards!"

TBK_rebuild_ruins:0 "Reconstruction Bureau"
TBK_rebuild_ruins_desc:0 "There is much to do in the reconstruction of the land and industry following the nigh-cataclysmic war with Chiropterra. If we wish to build back stronger than before then we must make significant headway in rebuilding what was lost in order to build off of it."

TBK_employment_welfare:0 "Work For the Unemployed"
TBK_employment_welfare_desc:0 "If there’s one thing that national projects are good for, it’s reducing the number of unemployed creatures and improving national infrastructure. What better way to get things going again whilst improving the interconnectivity of the federation?"

TBK_unified_education:0 "Unified Education Program"
TBK_unified_education_desc:0 "It’s about time we sorted out some national standards for education, something that’s currently either disparate at best or entirely nonexistent depending on which part of the federation you live in. We’ll make best sure to get the foals reading books and writing stories for our Hazrumenian family."

TBK_students_and_employers:0 "Student-Employer Vocational Scheme"
TBK_students_and_employers_desc:0 "If there’s one thing that students should be doing after school, it’s practical studies. They need the skills and a bigger labour pool is never something to avoid. The state will set up programmes to make sure they leave education with the knowledge they need to go right into work!"

TBK_academic_benefits:0 "Academic Research"
TBK_academic_benefits_desc:0 "If there’s one thing that students should be doing after school, it’s further education. We need forward-thinking innovators to propel the federation into a new age. The state will make sure that every student knows that they have every opportunity to contribute to science!"

TBK_tobuck_campus:0 "Wallnut Heritage College"
TBK_tobuck_campus_desc:0 "What better than to open a new centre for higher education named after the one and only Wallnut Drive! Sure he’s never had tertiary education himself, but the state is sure that he’ll appreciate the gesture all the same; a new college is still a new college in any case!"

TBK_pension_plans:0 "Universal Pensions Bill"
TBK_pension_plans_desc:0 "Pensions for the weary citizens within our ever-growing Hazrumenian family are a natural progression of existing worker laws. We shall reward those who have worked hard to lay the foundations of and build the federation that so many now live within."

TBK_subsidized_healthcare:0 "Subsidized Healthcare"
TBK_subsidized_healthcare_desc:0 "Though fully state-funded healthcare is currently beyond the purview of the government’s budget, we are far from incapable of helping. The state will front a portion of all medical costs for the good of the family that it protects and cherishes."

TBK_liberal_economics:0 "The Free Market"
TBK_liberal_economics_desc:0 "Opening up to the world is necessary for progress and for prosperity. We cannot sit idly by as our neighbours embrace external markets and the careful guiding hoof of economic liberalism. The time has come for our Hazrumenian family to embrace another important aspect of modern harmony."

TBK_two_half_plan:0 "2&¾ Year Plan"
TBK_two_half_plan_desc:0 "If we are to develop Hazrumenia, then it would be best if we developed the lands quickly so that our enemies may not take advantage of our weakened capacity. Rapid industrialization and modernisation must carry forth our federal dreams."

TBK_farmer_bonds:0 "Bonds For Farmers"
TBK_farmer_bonds_desc:0 "Investments are a surefire way to encourage continued economic growth, particularly in sectors that leave much to be desired. Farmers and their farms lack considerable amounts of equipment and knowhow when it comes to mechanised farming, so we’ll give them the means to figure it out!"

TBK_diversified_crops:0 "Diversified Fields"
TBK_diversified_crops_desc:0 "We can’t simply rely on subsistence farming anymore if we wish to make full use of both the ongoing economic growth and the money to be made in selling our produce. The state will provide minor incentives to grow secondary crops and our farmers will soon reap the benefits of their plurality of plants."

TBK_agricultural_development_focus:0 "Ministry of Agriculture And Rural Development"
TBK_agricultural_development_focus_desc:0 "With the meteoric rise in our farming industry, things have begun to get a little messy regarding land use and the general surplus of certain produce on the market. With a state ministry to get things organised, we should see development continue at an exponential rate!"

TBK_corporate_farms:0 "Corporate Farms"
TBK_corporate_farms_desc:0 "With the growth of any market comes the gradual development of larger companies that begin to compete with one another for their fair share in the sector. Luckily for the state, this means that they’ll keep their prices down for competition’s sake and develop the surrounding lands for us!"

TBK_agricultural_mechanization:0 "Tractor Co-Operatives"
TBK_agricultural_mechanization_desc:0 "Though we have done much to improve the average financial stock of all individuals within Hazrumenia, modern agricultural equipment is still really quite expensive. To that end, cooperative projects in which equipment is shared alongside profits will be a great boon for our agricultural endeavours."

TBK_efficient_supply_lines:0 "From Field To Plants"
TBK_efficient_supply_lines_desc:0 "A little optimization can go a long way and the supply chain between the farms and the processing plants is far from perfect. With a little work and some careful planning, it should be no time before the rail networks and road routes can support the vastly increased production."

TBK_development_plans:0 "General Development Plans"
TBK_development_plans_desc:0 "As the name would suggest, the government has developed some rather loose plans for the development of the economy and in particular of our industry. With just a little industrial zoning and lot allocation, we can easily provide land and list requirements for the construction of new industrial plants."

TBK_infrastructure_expansion:0 "Federal Railway Union"
TBK_infrastructure_expansion_desc:0 "Though some are concerned about the emergence of unions, they nevertheless hold an important place in politics and industrial development. Should the railroads go silent, the economy would grind to a halt; it’s best we keep the track workers and train drivers on side."

TBK_roadways:0 "The Black Veins"
TBK_roadways_desc:0 "The dark tarmac of roads are the lifeblood of both our civilian and military infrastructure and represent an immensely important asset for the administration. Though it will make the coffers suffer in the short term, investing in our transport network only promises great things in the future."

TBK_wholecase_urbanization:0 "The Concrete Future"
TBK_wholecase_urbanization_desc:0 "Whilst it is true that industry can often be overbearing when it comes to the grey concrete and the dark smog of progress, it is a necessary evil. The state will do its best to protect places of historical import across Hazrumenia, but nothing and nobody will stand in the way of progress and prosperity."

TBK_synthetic_oil_investment:0 "Synthetic Gasoline Industries"
TBK_synthetic_oil_investment_desc:0 "Though traces of black gold in Zarantia may eventually reveal more substantial fields, for the moment oil remains a resource which we have precious little access to. The obvious course of action is to invest in synthetic programmes through which we can create a local surplus for civilian and military use."

TBK_manehattan_of_zebrica:0 "Manehattan of Zebrica"
TBK_manehattan_of_zebrica_desc:0 "Manehatten is the city of dreams and Tobuck is far achieving such a title, or at least it was merely a decade ago. Now it’s the centre of a new harmonic society, a beacon of what can be achieved even in the most insidious and morally bankrupt regimes. Perhaps our capital is worthy of such a title too."

TBK_free_trade_enshrined:0 "Embrace Free Trade"
TBK_free_trade_enshrined_desc:0 "Far from the shady dealings of Pea Shooter and the centralised system that reigned prior to the creation of the federation, free trade is a logical evolution of state policy. If we are truly to provide individuals with equality of opportunity, then we must make trade fair game for all."

TBK_foreign_investors:0 "Court the Investors"
TBK_foreign_investors_desc:0 "‘Brown nosing’ isn’t exactly the most well respected of activities amongst business owners and investors, but it certainly does the job if you can do it right. With a little work and a lot of patience, we can instil some international confidence in our economy."

TBK_federal_bit:0 "North Zebrican Bit"
TBK_federal_bit_desc:0 "The Equestrians are yet to adopt harmony in its true form, but they’ve done a lot of things right in the time it’s taken to get them here. More specifically, they have embraced the idea of a unifying currency and it would be prudent of us to take that leaf out of their book."

TBK_banking_act:0 "The Bill and Coin Act"
TBK_banking_act_desc:0 "If we want to have a dependable and stable currency, it is imperative that the state guarantees the private holdings of investors and citizens alike. We cannot have criminals or simple economic crises destroy the good faith in our economy that we have established."

TBK_investment_boon:0 "Investment Boon"
TBK_investment_boon_desc:0 "Investment is a necessary part of modern economics and individuals often have the power to make or break important fiscal deals. Bean Counter and his associates are more than capable of serving as an economic consultancy for the government, especially now that we've guaranteed their holdings."

TBK_rich_society:0 "Prosperity Garners Prosperity"
TBK_rich_society_desc:0 "If there’s one thing economic growth is good for, it’s more economic growth! It’s a circular system of investment, the investments paying off and both parties profiting and then using that money to make more investments; isn't money a brilliant thing?"

TBK_wallnut_economic_miracle:0 "Land of Hard Work"
TBK_wallnut_economic_miracle_desc:0 "Our Hazrumenian family is certainly innovative and prosperous, but also we’re a hardworking bunch on top of that! As long as we make our money and the pensions for the work we do are good, anyone can do anything in this lovely federation of ours."

TBK_wallnuts_industrialists:0 "My Good Moguls"
TBK_wallnuts_industrialists_desc:0 "Though it surprised everyone initially, it seems as though Vasile Tradat, Bean Counter and Home Brew have taken to legitimate business in earnest. With their expertise and skill in deal brokering, they’re certain to make quite a name for themselves."

TBK_bean_counter_business:0 "B. Counter & Co."
TBK_bean_counter_business_desc:0 "Bean Counter recently decided to found a small string of banks with his financial expertise, a small string of banks which have rapidly become some of the larger economic entities within the borders of the federation. Needless to say that liaising with some of their experts will be most beneficial."

TBK_home_brew_business:0 "Homely Coffee Corporation"
TBK_home_brew_business_desc:0 "Coffee has quickly become one of the most valuable commodities the world over. To nopony’s surprise, Home Brew was quick to capitalise off of the rapid growth of an industry in which he already took interest and is already reaping the benefits of his good timing."

TBK_vasile_business:0 "Tradat Manuafacturing"
TBK_vasile_business_desc:0 "Given his cooperation with Pea Shooter, it’s no surprise that Vasile has sauntered confidently back into the arms business. Though the weapons designed under his company have thus far been rather unorthodox, they also seem to work surprisingly well and can be made for cheap."

TBK_stimulate_economy:0 "Stimulate Economy"
TBK_stimulate_economy_desc:0 "Private investments are important, but the state is an incredibly important part of economic development; especially when it comes to funding. Providing citizens with economic incentives to start their own companies and further the industrial development of Hazrumenia is our prerogative."

TBK_free_growth:0 "Fiscal Autonomy"
TBK_free_growth_desc:0 "The state has no business in business. It should remain entirely independent of economic affairs and allow growth to happen at a more natural pace. A government’s duty is to its citizens in resolving disputes and maintaining a monopoly on force to protect the citizens from one another."

TBK_private_markets:0 "Competetive Innovations"
TBK_private_markets_desc:0 "Competition within markets is the most important factor for spurring innovation and sector development, far more influential than even the best of corporate reviews for efficiency.

TBK_issue_monopolies:0 "Theory of Monopoly"
TBK_issue_monopolies_desc:0 "Whilst monopolies can certainly be detrimental to any market, they can only maintain their position if they continue to innovate.

TBK_foster_competition_desc:0 "Competition in internal Hazrumenian markets is just as important as competition in the global market and may not be sullied by any existing or potential monopolies. We must always encourage easily available technology via continued prosperity from competition."

TBK_raw_resource_exploitation:0 "Riches of Land"
TBK_raw_resource_exploitation_desc:0 "For all the deserts and the jungles in Hazrumenia, the land that is usable has much to covet both in fertility and in resources. It’s high time we began a proper extraction program to make best use of our natural bounty, not least for the fact that we now have a stable market to sell on."

TBK_ulnz_mining_ministry:0 "ULNZ Bureau of Mines"
TBK_ulnz_mining_ministry_desc:0 "Resource extraction is a complicated affair when it comes to organisation, permits and all the other administrative aspects that make paper pushers suffer. It would be best if the state created a subordinate ministry to handle the paperwork for our ever-growing mining sector."

TBK_analyze_lands:0 "Conduct Land Analysis"
TBK_analyze_lands_desc:0 "There’s no better time than the present to formally survey the land and see what Hazrumenia has to offer. Given our already considerable mining industry, it stands to reason that the administration’s efforts to expand it should return our investments many times over."

TBK_griffonian_mining_companies:0 "Miners of Griffonia"
TBK_griffonian_mining_companies_desc:0 "The griffons are industrious creatures and are particularly talented in the field of resource extraction, both for their coveted techniques and their enchanted equipment. We could make great use of their expertise and would do well to invite whichever companies we can contact."

TBK_wingbardian_company:0 "Azienda Generale Wingbardia Petroli"
TBK_wingbardian_company_desc:0 "The Wingbardians are uniquely gifted in the field of oil and oil-based resources. With their help we can make great strides in the field of synthetic materials, particularly with regard to rubber and the exploitation of - unsurprisingly - oil."

TBK_republican_company:0 "Société Métallurgique de Orvalillo"
TBK_republican_company_desc:0 "The Aquileia are uniquely gifted in the field of metalwork and the industries surrounding its usage. With their help we can make great strides in the field of metallurgy, particularly with regard to aluminium and the exploitation of iron deposits which we can use to make steel."

TBK_wallnut_harmony_diplomacy:0 "The Wallnut Pledge"
TBK_wallnut_harmony_diplomacy_desc:0 "Wallnut has always stood for democracy, harmony and our geopolitical aims. It is his dream to unite the seemingly disparate members of the Hazrumenian family and bring them into the fold with open arms. He will defend our dream and our cause, to the very end."

TBK_harmony_alliance_internal_development:0 "Treaty of Tobuck"
TBK_harmony_alliance_internal_development_desc:0 "A formal declaration to all nearby Harmonists of our intentions will do wonders for our international reputation, not least for the fact that they may be willing to assist in our future endeavours for our Hazrumenian family as a result."

TBK_harmony_alliance_vaccine_plan:0 "War Against Pandemics"
TBK_harmony_alliance_vaccine_plan_desc:0 "Disease has always been one of the most potent killers, moreso even than war and perhaps famine too. It is the charge of the government and of all members of the Hazrumenian family to work towards eliminating such diseases through medical cooperation."

TBK_harmony_alliance_research_cooperation:0 "HETA"
TBK_harmony_alliance_research_cooperation_desc:0 "Science and technology are something which all nations strive to improve over time, but it is strangely uncommon for many nations to cooperate in order to achieve the desired innovation. With the Hazrumenian Education and Technology Assembly, this will change for the better."

TBK_harmony_alliance_shared_vision:0 "Shared Vision"
TBK_harmony_alliance_shared_vision_desc:0 "The federation and our Hazrumenian family have a vision of democracy, of harmony and of freedom. It is a dream we all share and wish to work towards, a future within our grasp. Soon we will have our collective vision come to pass, united and free."

TBK_harmony_alliance_state_visits:0 "State Visits"
TBK_harmony_alliance_state_visits_desc:0 "There’s nothing like a visit - or a party - to really cement relations and cooperation between partners in harmony and democracy. What better than for Wallnut to officially visit our neighbours and charm them with his characteristic smile?"

TBK_harmony_alliance_council:0 "Council of Hazrumenia"
TBK_harmony_alliance_council_desc:0 "Though not an official legislative body in any real capacity, the Council of Hazrumenia will serve as an important supranational body in which to discuss a unified approach to foreign policy and international relations. More cooperation between members of the Hazrumenian family is always a good thing."

TBK_harmony_alliance_security_cooperation:0 "Mutual Security"
TBK_harmony_alliance_security_cooperation_desc:0 "An attack against one is an attack against all, we must be ready to defend our Hazrumenian family from all that seek to tear it apart. Interlinking the high commands of each military and endeavouring to prepare every state for war is a necessity for our security."

TBK_harmony_alliance_army_exercises:0 "Supranational Military Exercises"
TBK_harmony_alliance_army_exercises_desc:0 "If we are to embrace full military readiness against any possible threat to the federation and our family, we must train our troops to be ready to defend us. It could be the Colthaginians, it could be the Hippogriffs or even the Maregyptians; whatever the case, we must be prepared."

TBK_harmony_alliance_army_integration:0 "United Hazrumenian Defence Force"
TBK_harmony_alliance_army_integration_desc:0 "The dream of Hazrumenian harmony is something that every creature can stand up for. With a little effort towards recruiting and a large emphasis on the importance of supranational defence, we will be able to mobilise a large number of currently idle individuals."

TBK_harmony_alliance_cultural_work:0 "Land of Many Equines"
TBK_harmony_alliance_cultural_work_desc:0 "Ponies, Zebras and thestrals. We are many and may differ in appearance, but together we are united and strong; we will fight for our family and our dream! Our vision for democracy and freedom shall not be trodden on by sentiments of race or disparity!"

TBK_harmony_alliance_we_are_hazrumenians:0 "We Are All Hazrumenians"
TBK_harmony_alliance_we_are_hazrumenians_desc:0 "There is one thing that unites us. It’s not culture, heritage or race; but our family. We are all Hazrumenians, a proud and stalwart people filled with vigour and a desire to be free! We are all part of something greater, something that every single creature can be proud of!"

TBK_warzena_union:0 "Harmony In Warzena"
TBK_warzena_union_desc:0 "The history of Warzena and Tobuck is not an easy one to overcome, but it is one that gives our citizens something to reflect upon. Our Hazrumenian family will never be torn apart by squabbles and ridiculous conflicts over land. Never another custodianship!"

TBK_union_warzena_bonus:0 "Re-Invigorate Trade Routes"
TBK_union_warzena_bonus_desc:0 "Before the invasion of the Storm King, there were relatively stable trading relations established between the city of Tobuck and the Warzenan kingdom. Though they have been long dormant, those routes should be opened once more; as both a kind and profitable gesture of friendship."

TBK_union_warzena_integration:0 "Riverlands of Warzena"
TBK_union_warzena_integration_desc:0 "Warzena has always been a rich land full of winding rivers and thoughtful zebras. They have never before been closer to the hooves of their Hazrumenian family and the time has come to welcome them back, forgiving them for their warlike past and supporting their reforms."

TBK_hippogriffia_talks:0 "Telegram To Aris"
TBK_hippogriffia_talks_desc:0 "Even though they occupy Hazrumenian land, they’re not so bad. With a little effort and an outstretched hoof, a telegram to their doorstep may indeed be well received. Perhaps we may yet make friends with these curious outsiders."

TBK_maregypt_diplomacy:0 "Entente With Maregypt"
TBK_maregypt_diplomacy_desc:0 "Though a military alliance is likely off of the table, that doesn’t mean we can’t build bridges with the Maregyptians. After all, they built Tobuck way back in ancient times; the least we could do is offer them an accord."

TBK_zumidian_issue:0 "The Zumidian Lands"
TBK_zumidian_issue_desc:0 "One pressing matter on which we must unfortunately confront Mount Aris is the matter of their Zumidian territories. Not only were they gained through conquest, but they remain unrepresented and are an integral part of Hazrumenia. Come what may, we must ask the difficult question."

TBK_zumidian_integration:0 "Federal District of Zumidia"
TBK_zumidian_integration_desc:0 "Zumidia has lacked democracy and harmony for many years now and, though the right to self determination cannot be denied, it would be the responsible course of action to ensure they get it right first time as part of the federation. They can always vote to succeed later, after all."

TBK_zumidian_bonus:0 "Zumidian Republic"
TBK_zumidian_bonus_desc:0 "Though we’ll stick our hooves in to make sure nothing too concerning comes out of the blue, our Zumidian siblings must have their own republic to decide their own fate. Our Hazrumenian dream is one of cooperation between respected family members, not one of forced assimilation."

TBK_colthage_diplomacy:0 "Detente With Colthage"
TBK_colthage_diplomacy_desc:0 "The Colthagians haven’t exactly been the most stable bunch as of late, nor have they been the most polite when discussing the matter of Zumidia. In fact, given the chance, it’s likely that they’d try to take it for themselves. It would be prudent for us to make sure they remain cordial."

TBK_harmony_alliance_economy:0 "Hazrumenian Commercial Pact"
TBK_harmony_alliance_economy_desc:0 "If there’s one thing that freedom has taught us it’s that the less boundaries there are between countries and peoples, the quicker the economy grows. Our Hazrumenian family will share in this prosperity in due time, once we show them the ropes."

TBK_zarantia_union:0 "Harmony In Zarantia"
TBK_zarantia_union_desc:0 "Ah, the Zarantians. They’ve never been a particularly aggressive bunch, but they do always seem to have an eye for our capital city. All the same, we can forgive their desire for modernisation through force and welcome them to our dream for Hazrumenia."

TBK_union_zarantia_bonus:0 "Right of Free Travel"
TBK_union_zarantia_bonus_desc:0 "There aren’t many creatures that would willingly travel into the tribal lands of Zarantia, but those that would like to visit deserve as much of a chance as those that would like to move to Tobuck from the desert. Free movement for all, free travel for prosperity and harmony!"

TBK_union_zarantia_integration:0 "Dunes of Zarantia"
TBK_union_zarantia_integration_desc:0 "TThough we’ve had our differences in the past, the Zarantians are now nothing less than another loving sibling in our Hazrumenian family. It’s high time that we embrace them fully and welcome them with open arms, celebrating the true victory of the tribes in their march towards modernity."

TBK_harmony_alliance_conference:0 "All-Members Economic Forum"
TBK_harmony_alliance_conference_desc:0 "Economic cooperation is the next logical step in supranational integration, providing a basis upon which to provide prosperity for all within the union. Development and industry for all members of the union and economic infrastructure to connect all peoples!"

TBK_harmony_alliance_tariffs:0 "Tariff Reductions"
TBK_harmony_alliance_tariffs_desc:0 "Though many would have you believe that tariffs grant wealth to the countries that they protect the resources of, the opposite is in fact true. In the long term, tariffs create economic barriers between states that limit potential growth; our Hazrumenian family has no need for such things."

TBK_harmony_alliance_shared_passport:0 "Hazrumenian Passport"
TBK_harmony_alliance_shared_passport_desc:0 "Passports make identification easier, but what’s the point of every Hazrumenian state having its own passport if free travel between borders is already encouraged? This status quo will not do, the state will provide all union citizens with Hazrumenian passports instead, for the sake of efficiency."

TBK_harmony_alliance_development_fund:0 "Hazrumenian Development Bureau"
TBK_harmony_alliance_development_fund_desc:0 "Facilitating development has proven to be a somewhat arduous task for the separated bureaucracies of the union states. To mitigate these issues, a unified planning office shall be established with the intention of streamlining the process and improving it to no end."

TBK_harmony_alliance_infrastructure:0 "Railway Gauge Uniformity"
TBK_harmony_alliance_infrastructure_desc:0 "The disparate railway gauges have proven to be problematic for transport between union states both in terms of civilian movement and goods transportation. Ensuring that these issues do not persist is as simple as making sure we all use the same convenient rail dimensions."

TBK_harmony_alliance_one_currency:0 "The Union Shekel"
TBK_harmony_alliance_one_currency_desc:0 "Much like our own federal currency, convenience and prosperity can be further ensured by introducing and utilising a broadly accepted union currency that will be far more reliable than local ones. What is a union without unity? What is prosperity if it isn’t shared with all?"

TBK_harmony_alliance_fixed_rates:0 "Fixed Exchange Rates"
TBK_harmony_alliance_fixed_rates_desc:0 "Fixed exchange rates will ensure that no matter the circumstances, outside enterprises will have their investments guaranteed. We would be nothing without common faith in our economy and so the same must be true of our Hazrumenian family too."

TBK_harmony_alliance_central_bank:0 "Hazrumenian Central Bank"
TBK_harmony_alliance_central_bank_desc:0 "A central bank is just as important for a union of countries as it is for the constituent countries themselves. A place where loans and debts can be sorted out on a far grander scale will doubtless be useful for our growing Hazrumenian family."

TBK_harmony_alliance_agriculture_pact:0 "Shared Comission of Agriculture"
TBK_harmony_alliance_agriculture_pact_desc:0 "Though not exactly an integral part of Hazrumenian development, agricultural growth is incredibly important for certain areas of the union in which food is considerably more scarce. An organisation for directing the expansion of the agricultural sectors within the union is a prudent solution."

TBK_harmony_alliance_cross_border_industries:0 "Cross-Border Industrial Development"
TBK_harmony_alliance_cross_border_industries_desc:0 "Parallel development of industries and infrastructure over constituent state borders is something that should be encouraged for the sake of cooperation between all parts of our Hazrumenian family. Who would willingly cut themselves off from industry and progress?"

TBK_hazrumenia_union:0 "Harmonious Hazrumenia"
TBK_hazrumenia_union_desc:0 "We have finally done it; one Hazrumenia under harmony, liberty and democracy! The years spent getting to this point have all been worth it to see our dream of a united Hazrumenian family fulfilled. Long live the union, long live the federation and long live harmony!"

TBK_dusk_wane_start_desc:0 "С поражением Хироптерры, Тобук стал чем-то большим, нежели чем просто ещё одним второстепенным государством в Зебрике. Однако ещё многое предстоит сделать. Убедив Уоллната принять социалистическое правительство, Даск Уэйн теперь должен заняться проблемами, которые беспокоят рабочий класс недавно образованных Объединённых Земель Северной Зебрики."

TBK_dusk_labour_front:0 "Объединённый трудовой фронт" ###Garion
TBK_dusk_labour_front_desc:0 "Обеспечение безопасности рабочего как дома, так и на работе, должно быть конечной целью любой достойной социалистической нации; в конце концов, со счастливым пролетариатом приходит процветающее государство. По рекомендации Даска, Уоллнат подписал соглашение о создании официального государственного профсоюза—Объединённый Трудовой Фронт."

TBK_convince_temples_desc:0 "Теперь, когда храмы Хироптерры находятся под нашей юрисдикцией, тамошние пони боятся того, что мы можем с ними сделать. Уоллнат изначально хотел снести их все, но Даск Уэйн сумел убедить его, что обещание восстановить и реконструировать эти древние святилища сделает население более восторженным и сговорчивым."

TBK_old_teachings:0 "Древняя Луна" ###Garion
TBK_old_teachings_desc:0 "Нелегко преодолеть тысячелетнее промывание мозгов, и всё же, когда вы идёте по улицам Нью Аякачтли, становится очевидным нечто странное: пони начинают причислять себя не к Хирроптерцам, а скорее к гражданам Объединённых Земель Северной Зебрики. Возможно, со временем они преодолеют глубоко укоренившуюся одержимость Найтмер Мун в пользу веры в Старую Луну."

TBK_communal_administration:0 "Долой старьё,\nда профсоюзам!" ###Garion
TBK_communal_administration_desc:0 "Поскольку рабочие Хироптерры всё больше и больше привыкают к самостоятельному управлению предприятиями, вполне логично, что молодым профсоюзам следует предоставить больше контроля над их повседневной жизнью. В конце концов, никто не знает потребностей пролетариата так, как они сами."

TBK_merge_faith_and_unions:0 "Эдикт Красной Луны" ###Garion
TBK_merge_faith_and_unions_desc:0 "Найтмер больше не будет править этой землёй! Да будет всем известно, что Старая Луна ценит всех как равных, и мы тоже! От самых кротких работников до самых уважаемых членов профсоюза—все будут наслаждаться процветанием и более осмысленной жизнью!"

TBK_moonspeaker_union:0 "Федеративный союз говорящих с Луной" ###Garion
TBK_moonspeaker_union_desc:0 "После того, как мы ясно заявили о своих намерениях сохранить храмы Хироптерры, группа говорящих с Луной сообщила нам, что они создали организацию, которая стремится помочь пони Хироптерры примириться с администрацией Уоллната. Всё, о чем они просят,—это выделить им средства, чтобы помочь восстановить разрушенные районы их общин и накормить тех, кто страдает."

TBK_police_union:0 "Констебли Коммуны" ###Garion
TBK_police_union_desc:0 "Хотя мы и победили легионеров, всё ещё существуют очаги фанатичной элиты, вызывающие проблемы по всей сельской местности. С одобрения Уоллната Даск Уэйн проведёт политические реформы, направленные привлечение этих преступников к ответственности."

TBK_social_welfare_system:0 "Социальная солидарность" ###Garion
TBK_social_welfare_system_desc:0 "С появлением новой нации возникают и новые проблемы. Среди них бедность является особенно серьёзной, о которой мало кто любит думать. С захватом казны Хироптерры мы получили возможность вложить немного денег в копыта тех, кто действительно в них нуждается. Звучит не особо сложно, не так ли?"

TBK_extensive_aid:0 "Оптовая помощь"
TBK_extensive_aid_desc:0 "В обществе и государстве, какими бы справедливыми и праведными они ни были, всегда найдутся те, чья жизнь прошла по неудачному сценарию. Наш долг—оказывать им помощь и относиться к ним с добротой, поскольку это всегда было их правом. От каждого по способностям, каждому по потребностям."

TBK_jobs_network:0 "Работа для безработных"
TBK_jobs_network_desc:0 "Беднейшие слои общества и государства часто оказываются без работы, и, следовательно, без какой-либо возможности подняться с того социального дна, на котором они томятся. Мы построим множество правительственных зданий, которые можно будет посетить, чтобы найти вакансии на низкоквалифицированных работах. Цель этой программы—обеспечить этим беднякам денежную безопасность."

TBK_socialist_healthcare:0 "Больницы коммун"
TBK_socialist_healthcare_desc:0 "Концепция общинного врача не нова, но нам необходима формализация роли местных специалистов. Таким образом государство поможет им с поставками необходимого оборудования и лекарств, а также с получением более высокого уровня образования, который позволит лечить даже самые серьёзные травмы при любых обстоятельствах без необходимости выезжать в город."

TBK_national_identity_card:0 "Н.У.Л"
TBK_national_identity_card_desc:0 "Система национального удостоверение личности—это, безусловно, то, к чему наши граждане привыкнут не сразу. несмотря на скептицизм части населения, ДДаск Уэйн заверил, что цель этой системы исключительно организационная; По его словам, удостоверения были созданы для отслеживания мест работы, семейного положения и других подобных вещей с целью ведения учёта."

TBK_good_food:0 "Превосходная Еда,\nПревосходные рабочие"
TBK_good_food_desc:0 "Несмотря на нашу политику питания для всех, независимо от обстоятельств, до нашего сведения было доведено, некоторые продукты, продаваемые населению населению, лучше всего не употреблять в пищу. В ответ на это, Генералиссимус Уоллнат одобрил предложение Даска Уйэна о внедрении национального стандарта на пищевые продукты, как импортируемые, так и произведённые или выращенные в стране."

TBK_confiscate_wealth:0 "Плоды их труда"
TBK_confiscate_wealth_desc:0 "Хотя Хироптерра, возможно, и называла их "рабочими", эти бедные пони пострадали от многих несправедливостей, начиная от того, что их оторвали от родных семей, и заканчивая тем, что их заставляли служить богине, в которую они не верили! Самое меньшее, что мы можем сделать,—это предложить им их собственный участок земли и будущее, которое они будут определять самостоятельно."

TBK_labour_union_formations:0 "Профсоюзы делают нас сильнее"
TBK_labour_union_formations_desc:0 "Профсоюзы являются основой любой истинно-социалистической нации. Хотя мы сделали это важной темой на нескольких встречах, многие работники до сих пор даже не понимают концепцию таких организаций. Даск никогда не любил пропаганду, но он признаёт, что в данном случае важно помочь рабочим понять, что они могут поддерживать друг друга через профсоюзы."

TBK_power_unions:0 "Смерть национализма"
TBK_power_unions_desc:0 "В течение многих лет большинство граждан нашей страны считали себя верными Зарантии. Некоторые даже отказывались воевать против них. Времена меняются, и будущее, к которому мы стремимся, светлее, чем то, которое могла бы предложить любая королева пустыни."

TBK_factory_production_councils:0 "Вытеснить землевладельцев"
TBK_factory_production_councils_desc:0 "Жестокие надсмотрщики бывших "рабочих" слишком долго имели право голоса в промышленном секторе! Даск Уэйн предложил убрать их и заменить их советом, состоящим из простых работников, чтобы оптимизировать производство."

TBK_wealth_equalization:0 "Земля равных"
TBK_wealth_equalization_desc:0 "Если мы хотим, чтобы нас запомнили за что-то, так пусть это будет равенство среди наших граждан. Не будет никого, кто чувствовал бы, что их судьба в жизни несправедлива или несчастна, потому что эта земля принадлежит рабочим. В конце концов, сам Уоллнат сказал: "Я хочу, чтобы праздновали все, а не только мои друзья!""

TBK_workers_self_management:0 "Самоуправляемое производство"
TBK_workers_self_management_desc:0 "Пришло время расширить полномочия местных советов трудящихся. Они получат больше прав в юридических и производственных процессах, что сделает их неотъемлемой частью нашей федеральной системы. Рабочие должны, наконец, полностью контролировать средства производства!"

TBK_land_electrification:0 "Сияющие огни"
TBK_land_electrification_desc:0 "Электрификация наших дорог и городов является следующим логичным шагом в наших промышленных усилиях. Инфраструктура является ключом к любому значительному общественному прогрессу, и поэтому мы позаботимся о том, чтобы она была подготовлена для будущих поколений промышленного и технологического развития!"

TBK_modern_amenities:0 "Профсоюз СМИ"
TBK_modern_amenities_desc:0 "Было не особо сложно убедить несколько вещательных компаний, работающих в стране, объединить свои усилия в рамках нового профсоюза. Уоллнат особенно ценит стремление улучшить качество эфирных и печатных материалов наряду с пользой для социалистического образования."

TBK_communal_housing:0 "Коммунальные стандарты"
TBK_communal_housing_desc:0 "Коммунальные латифундии или "общежития" обеспечат нашим немногочисленным несчастным гражданам базовый уровень жизни, необходимый им для выживания, если всё остальное необъяснимым образом будет потеряно. Действительно, поскольку они создают среду, в которой некоторые блага являются общими, Даск Уйэн предполагает, что они могут даже помочь жителям развить общинную идентичность."

TBK_labour_federalism:0 "Эссе о трудовом федерализме"
TBK_labour_federalism_desc:0 "Выдержка из газеты лучше всего объясняет эту концепцию: 'Социализм и прогресс находятся у нас в копытах рабочих; Наша страна это федерация пролетариата с равными правами, как положительными, так и отрицательными, и она является наилучшей возможной государственной структурой, в которой этот прогресс может быть достигнут. Я зависим от рабочих также, как и они зависимы от меня.'"

TBK_labour_consitution:0 "Федеральный билль о правах"
TBK_labour_consitution_desc:0 "Федеральный билль о правах мало чем отличается от других подобных правовых документов в отношении его общей концепции как гаранта индивидуальных прав и свобод. Тем не менее, он отличается от остальных, закрепляя дополнительные права, такие как право на протест и право на труд, которые многие другие 'прогрессивные' государства отказываются осуществлять."

TBK_right_to_unionize:0 "Права профсоюзов"
TBK_right_to_unionize_desc:0 "Такая фундаментальная часть нашего общества и государства не может быть исключительной или ограниченной созданными профсоюзами, право на объединение в профсоюзы по любой причине и для всех созданий должно быть гарантировано и закреплено. С благословения Уоллната у Уэйна не должно возникнуть проблем с принятием этого неотъемлемого законодательного акта."

TBK_wealth_of_land:0 "Богатство земли"
TBK_wealth_of_land_desc:0 "Государственные инвестиции в сельскохозяйственную отрасль являются логичным следующим шагом в нашем промышленном развитии. Больше продовольствия означает больше излишков, что может дать нам дополнительные возможности для экспорта или обеспечить больший потолок потенциального роста населения в ближайшем будущем."

TBK_rural_industries:0 "Фабрики в глубинке"
TBK_rural_industries_desc:0 "Уоллнат убеждён, что небольшие производственные районы для местных сообществ эффективны и желательны для широкой общественности, чтобы им не приходилось совершать длительные поездки в традиционно более развитые районы страны, чтобы внести свой вклад в экономический рост и промышленный бум страны."

TBK_farming_mechanization:0 "Тракторные коллективы"
TBK_farming_mechanization_desc:0 "Уоллната убедили, что необходимо создавать крупные сельскохозяйственные коллективы, чтобы лучше распределять машины и землю между работниками. Эта коллективизация должна обеспечить равные возможности для всех сельскохозяйственных работников при сохранении более эффективного использования неделимых земель."

TBK_dusk_factories:0 "Накормить рабочих"
TBK_dusk_factories_desc:0 "Голодный рабочий—несчастный рабочий, как и любой голодный гражданин—несчастный гражданин. Мы должны кормить средства производства, если мы хотим, чтобы они производили и внедряли инновации в нашей быстро развивающейся стране; им больше никогда не придётся беспокоиться о том, как сегодня прокормить свой желудок."

TBK_union_militias:0 "Профсоюзы ополченцев"
TBK_union_militias_desc:0 "На данный момент, профсоюзы, принимающие форму организаций ополченцев, являются своего рода правовой серой зоной в отношении юрисдикции, и там, где применение силы считается целесообразным. Мы узаконим и отрегулируем процесс создания милиции при условии, что они будут служить в армии во время войны."

TBK_elected_commanders:0 "Выборные командиры"
TBK_elected_commanders_desc:0 "Подразделения ополчения хорошо известны демократичностью, при помощи которой они избирают своих собственных лидеров. Это ещё одна серая зона, которую мы будем кодифицировать как общепринятую и законную практику, при условии, что во время войны армия несёт ответственность за этих лидеров и их решения, а также командует ими."

TBK_work_dusk:0 "Союз Уоллната и Даска"
TBK_work_dusk_desc:0 "После медленного и тщательного рассмотрения вопроса со стороны нашего любимого Уоллната, Даск Уэйн убедил его, что логичный курс действий сейчас—привести его в свою фракцию. В ознаменование этого события, Даск пообещал устроить вечеринку в столице, на которой даже он будет присутствовать, но, что более важно, он приказал средствам массовой информации в полную силу работать в поддержку этого шага."

TBK_technological_industries:0 "Современное промышленное производство"
TBK_technological_industries_desc:0 "Технический прогресс при социализме, по крайней мере теоретически, совершенно безграничен.

TBK_electronics_industries:0 "Эксперименты с электроникой"
TBK_electronics_industries_desc:0 "Похоже, в области электроники есть нечто большее—то, что мы раньше не замечали.

TBK_chemical_industries_desc:0 "Хотя мы не против торговли с другими странами, в случае открытой войны внутренние запасы нефти и каучука могут стать жизненно важными для нашей военной промышленности. Уоллнат, в частности, выразил заинтересованность в этих разработках, сославшись на постоянную нехватку ресурсов у него как у военачальника. Разработка и производство начнутся как можно скорее."

TBK_niftyn_start:0 "Наследие Стил Сталлиона"
TBK_niftyn_start_desc:0 "С поражением Хироптерры, Тобук стал чем-то большим, чем просто ещё одним мелким государством Зебрики. Однако наша работа ещё далека от завершения.

TBK_industrial_ministry_desc:0 "Для достижения рая для трудящихся крайне важно, чтобы мы дали им в государстве возможности, позволяющие им расширить средства производства и продвинуть их вперёд. С одобрения Уоллната, Нифтин официально учредил министерство промышленного производства, с помощью которого он будет вести рабочих к величию."

TBK_workers_state:0 "Государство рабочих и крестьян"
TBK_workers_state_desc:0 "Федерация почти полностью состоит из рабочих и крестьян. Это их нация, их земля, их гордость и будущее, которое они все стремятся реализовать. Величие не приходит к тем, кто ждёт, оно приходит именно тогда, когда работа для его достижения выполнена."

TBK_purge_parasites:0 "Ценности классовой борьбы"
TBK_purge_parasites_desc:0 "Не может быть мира с теми, кто выступает против пролетариата и революции. Коррумпированные политики, декадентские нации и диссиденты совершенной формы коммунизма—все они будут раздавлены сапогом нашего неизбежного прогресса."

TBK_estate_collectivization:0 "Коллективизация имущества"
TBK_estate_collectivization_desc:0 "Большие земельные владения, будь то личные или используемые для ведения бизнеса, должны быть немедленно изъяты и перераспределены среди граждан нашего великого государства. Уоллнат согласен с тем, что если все будут владеть большим количеством земли, то все будут праздновать вместе в радости."

TBK_ponytariat_ownership:0 "Собственность пролетариата"
TBK_ponytariat_ownership_desc:0 "Фундаментальный принцип революции заключается в том, что земля должна быть предоставлена гражданам любого коммунистического государства. Мы не только пропишем это в своих законах, но и дополнительно создадим экономическую комиссию для обеспечения сотрудничества секторов экономики на взаимовыгодной основе."

TBK_state_industrial_control:0 "Центральная экономическая директива"
TBK_state_industrial_control_desc:0 "Федеральная комиссия по планированию иногда сталкивалась с трудностями при зонировании территорий для индустриализации из-за других законов, касающихся защиты определённых земель и зданий. Мы дадим им больше полномочий, чтобы гарантировать, что их работе ничто не помешает."

TBK_tobuck_arms_industries:0 "Директива о военной экономике"
TBK_tobuck_arms_industries_desc:0 "К радости генералиссимуса, Нифтин предложил значительное расширение военного производства, чтобы гарантировать, что государство не отстаёт от своих соседей по производственным мощностям или запасам. Реакционеры никогда не станут сильнее нас!"

TBK_artillery_production_bonus:0 "Краснознамённая артиллерия"
TBK_artillery_production_bonus_desc:0 "Ласковое название 'Краснознамённая' происходит от военных историй, которые появились после победы над Хироптеррой. При таком скудном запасе боеприпасов, артиллерия, как было известно, время от времени выпускала в небо или непосредственно по наступающему врагу массы сигнальных ракет, чтобы потянуть время. Хотя эта история действительно вдохновляет, возможно, было бы лучше обновить и должным образом пополнить наши артиллерийские запасы для будущих конфликтов."

TBK_infantry_weapon_production_bonus:0 "Новая модель боевой винтовки"
TBK_infantry_weapon_production_bonus_desc:0 "Теперь, когда мы в состоянии выпускать наши предыдущие разработки, и улучшать их, стало очевидно, что наши нынешние запасы оружия устарели и вызывают беспокойство своим разнообразием. Уоллната даже не нужно было убеждать в том, что необходимо новое и стандартизированное оружие для войск, и Нифтин с радостью согласился."

TBK_niftyn_factories:0 "Вооружение революции"
TBK_niftyn_factories_desc:0 "В том маловероятном случае, если наши профессиональные силы будут захвачены и разгромлены, долг рабочих и крестьян—воспользоваться слабиной. Мы закупим оружие и обучим подразделения рабочего ополчения, на случай если они понадобятся в предстоящих конфликтах."

TBK_resource_aquisition:0 "Министерство промышленных ресурсов"
TBK_resource_aquisition_desc:0 "Учитывая угрозу блокад и значительный риск реакционной торговой войны, вполне логично создать министерство для обеспечения того, чтобы ресурсы всегда могли быть предоставлены нашей тяжёлой промышленности. Излишне говорить, что Уоллнат быстро принял предложение Нифтина помочь производству оружия с распростёртыми копытами."

TBK_expand_steel_production:0 "Увеличить квоты на сталь"
TBK_expand_steel_production_desc:0 "Сталь является, пожалуй, самым важным ресурсом для дальнейшего развития нашей растущей промышленности. По этой причине производственные квоты будут увеличены для наиболее эффективных заводов, и указанные фабрики получат финансирование для расширения своей деятельности."

TBK_manerba_aluminium:0 "Бокситовые рудники Манербы"
TBK_manerba_aluminium_desc:0 "Манерба располагает внушительными запасами алюминия, которые до сих пор простаивают, несмотря на значительную добычу полезных ископаемых там. При некотором финансировании и небольшом дополнительном оборудовании рабочие начнут извлекать ещё больше богатств из наших огромных залежей ресурсов."

TBK_rapid_urbanization:0 "Министерство городского развития"
TBK_rapid_urbanization_desc:0 "В современную эпоху неудивительно, что модернизация городов является приоритетом, но это также стало очень сложной задачей из-за проблемы разрастания городов. Чтобы исправить эту проблему, Уоллнат подписал отличное предложение по созданию министерства городского развития."

TBK_urban_fortifications:0 "Директива о бункерах и убежищах"
TBK_urban_fortifications_desc:0 "С увеличением количества участвующей в боевых действиях авиации, всё более неизбежным становится факт того, что бомбардировщики попытаются добраться до наших городов и разрушить их. Хотя интеграция сети противовоздушной обороны в настоящее время непрактична, мы можем гарантировать, что все будущие конструкции будут сделаны из более прочных материалов и что в каждом здании будет располагаться бункер."

TBK_federal_militia:0 "Резервы федерации"
TBK_federal_militia_desc:0 "Этих доблестных рабочих и крестьян следует похвалить за их приверженность революционным идеалам в составе своих отрядов ополчения. К сожалению, организации ополчения, как известно, громоздки, и потенциально могут представлять угрозу, как для государства, так и для армии; федеральная интеграция является логичным решением."

TBK_socialist_education:0 "Учиться, учиться, и ещё раз учиться"
TBK_socialist_education_desc:0 "Уоллнат одобрил предложение Нифтина начать масштабную кампанию по ликвидации неграмотности среди всего населения. Они должны быть способны вести себя в светлое будущее так, как мы ведём их сейчас, во имя революции и самого коммунизма."

TBK_manual_lessons:0 "Образование на практике"
TBK_manual_lessons_desc:0 "Когда дело доходит до промышленности и обучения труду — нет ничего лучше практического опыта. Если мы хотим обучить новое поколение рабочих и коммунистов истинным профессиям нашего государства и идеологии, то это должно быть сделано должным образом."

TBK_military_education:0 "Уроки войны"
TBK_military_education_desc:0 "Хотя поначалу Уоллнат немного колебался, он подписал соглашение о расширении и реструктуризации школьной программы с учётом определённых уроков войны и боевых действий, чтобы лучше подготовить новые поколения к потенциальным будущим конфликтам."

TBK_communist_university:0 "Комиссариат просвещения"
TBK_communist_university_desc:0 "Нифтин предложил следующий логический шаг в развитии системы образования для федерации в целом. С введением регулирующего комиссариата по образованию мы можем совершенствовать и контролировать учебную программу с течением времени на благо всех."

TBK_marks_institute:0 "Институт имени Карамели Маркс"
TBK_marks_institute_desc:0 "Хотя мы многое сделали для системы образования федерации, отличникам до сих пор уделялось мало внимания. Уоллнат одобрил строительство нового университета в Тобуке, который предоставит самым талантливым коммунистам лучшее образование, которое мы можем предоставить."

TBK_hazrumenia_communist_party:0 "Коммунистическая партия Хазрумени"
TBK_hazrumenia_communist_party_desc:0 "Хотя наша фракция к настоящему времени уже обладает невероятным влиянием в администрации, было бы лучше формализовать эту власть ради соблюдения приличий. Скоро Нифтин объявит о создании коммунистической партии Хазрумени, партии для каждого рабочего и крестьянина."

TBK_soviets_model:0 "Уроки зимний революции"
TBK_soviets_model_desc:0 "Централизация власти необходима для единства и эффективности в нашем коммунистическом раю. Местным органам власти, или советам, как их начинают называть, будут предоставлены полномочия для проведения кампаний по продвижению революционных идей, что позволит подогнать в регионах рвение, необходимое для защиты наших коллег-рабочих."

TBK_communist_secret_police:0 "Совет государственной безопасности"
TBK_communist_secret_police_desc:0 "Те, кто стремится погасить пламя революции, как внутренней, так и внешней, не заслуживают пощады. Президент одобрил создание совета государственной безопасности, видя необходимость защиты революции от всех возможных угроз; операции по ликвидации инакомыслия и оппозиции начнутся незамедлительно."

TBK_state_mass_media:0 "Правда"
TBK_state_mass_media_desc:0 "Средства массовой информации уже давно являются эффективным инструментом воздействия на население, а с появлением радио они стали более доступными, чем когда-либо. Нифтин приступил к созданию национальной радиостанции и газеты, которые будут предоставлять рабочим и крестьянам всё, что им нужно знать."

TBK_expand_party_membership:0 "Рабочий, присоединись к борьбе!" ###Garion
TBK_expand_party_membership_desc:0 "Достижение единства путём массовости партии может поначалу показаться нелогичным, но реальность такова, что те, кого мы приглашаем в партию, будут поддерживать ее и Нифтина в дальнейшем при любых обстоятельствах. Кампания по набору персонала—это как раз то, что нам нужно, чтобы гарантировать, что разногласия в администрации вообще никогда не возникнут."

TBK_orthodox_stallionism:0 "Классический Марксист-Сталлионизм"
TBK_orthodox_stallionism_desc:0 "Нифтин—преданный ученик Маркса и Стил Сталлиона. Его мечта о коммунизме—мечта нации и рабочих; она будет распространяться, чтобы наше великое государство могло вскоре бросить вызов старому порядку упадка и реакционности, как и мечтали сами великие основатели."

TBK_first_hazrumenian_conference:0 "1 конференция ХКП"
TBK_first_hazrumenian_conference_desc:0 "Общественность всегда была союзником революции, и Нифтин проявлял особую заботу о том, чтобы он и Уоллнат, как её авангард, максимально использовали это. Видные коммунисты и сам глава партии выступит с проповедью о славе рабочей утопии на этой первой конференции."

TBK_new_style_tobuck:0 "Метрополии пролетариата"
TBK_new_style_tobuck_desc:0 "Тобук уже давно считается центром промышленного и городского развития, и так было даже до нашего великого государства. Пришло время сделать последние шаги к мегаполису, которым, как все знают, он может стать. Он должен служить образцом для других городов нашей федерации, являясь бьющимся сердцем коммунизма."

TBK_wallnut_stallionist:0 "Стальной Генералиссимус"
TBK_wallnut_stallionist_desc:0 "Уоллнат сделал много великих дел для коммунизма и для создания федерации. Нифтин и партия сочли нужным присвоить ему звание "Стального генералиссимуса" в честь его заслуг и приверженности революции; он, конечно, принял титул с огромной благодарностью и решил отпраздновать это событие."

TBK_stalliongrad_south:0 "Сталлионград Зебрики"
TBK_stalliongrad_south_desc:0 "Мы являемся родиной революции в Зебрике, и поэтому мы будем проводить политику идеологического авангарда на континенте. Нет никого, кто мог бы носить такой великолепный и заслуженный титул, как этот, и никого, кто мог бы взять на себя ответственность, которую влечёт за собой такая важная должность."

TBK_party_hq:0 "Штаб-квартира революции"
TBK_party_hq_desc:0 "Это большая честь - умереть за свой идеал коммунизма. Пропагандистская волна, направленная на врагов этой идеи, разработанная для оправдания грядущих конфликтов, сотворит чудеса с мнением населения о крупномасштабной войне, которая будет вестись против реакционеров."

TBK_control_militia:0 "Комиссары ополчений"
TBK_control_militia_desc:0 "Наконец-то пришло время убрать остатки подобия независимости, предоставленные подразделениям ополчения. Комиссары будут назначены в каждый батальон, и они будут служить точно так же, как и любые другие профессиональные войска. Хотя, конечно, они будут по-прежнему изображаться в СМИ народной милиций, ради привлечения большего числа существ в армию."

TBK_marksist_state:0 "Марксистско-Сталлионистская конституация"
TBK_marksist_state_desc:0 "Пора завершить конституцию для нашего рабочего рая. Как учили нас Стил Сталлион и Карамель Маркс, централизованное и могущественное государство необходимо для защиты прав всех рабочих, и этот важнейший документ отразит этот доказанный факт в своём содержании."

TBK_work_niftyn:0 "Партия Уоллната и Нифтина"
TBK_work_niftyn_desc:0 "После огромного количества времени, проведённого за дискуссиями, Нифтину удалось убедить Уоллната официально вступить в коммунистическую партию. Это не та организация, к которой привык генералиссимус, но он хорошо приспосабливается к своей новой роли лица и 'лидера' революции."

TBK_dusk_niftyn_meeting:0 "Социалистическая Хазрумени"
TBK_dusk_niftyn_meeting_desc:0 "Пришло время упрочить влияние и раз и навсегда закрепить идеалы внутри политических фракций этого великого социалистического государства. Битва за социалистическую мечту наконец-то закончилась."

TBK_wallnut_communist_diplomacy:0 "Декларация Уоллната"
TBK_wallnut_communist_diplomacy_desc:0 "Как предполагаемый лидер и авангард революции, Уоллнат обязан делать все заявления относительно войны и предстоящих конфликтов. Настало время для подобного, поскольку мы, наконец, готовы освободить рабочих, закованных в цепи декадентских обществ, которые нас окружают."

TBK_territory_warzena:0 "Уничтожить корону Варзены"
TBK_territory_warzena_desc:0 "Безмозглые монархисты Варзены считают, что их 'реформы' спасут их декадентское общество от краха; О, как же сильно они ошибаются. Мы значительно ускорим этот процесс - снесём их государство, а потом восстановим своими силами.."

TBK_drive_out_nobles:0 "Конец семьи Леопардов"
TBK_drive_out_nobles_desc:0 "Есть ещё пару осколков монархии Варзены, помимо ранее правившего короля. Династия Леопардов рассеяна и сравнительно неважна, но не бессильна; крайне важно, чтобы мы разобрались с ними, прежде чем остатки монархистов устремятся к старым правителям этой страны."

TBK_spread_collectivization:0 "Новые сельские коллективы"
TBK_spread_collectivization_desc:0 "С внедрением реальных реформ в Варзене, таких как увеличение числа новых сельских коллективов в регионе, тамошние зебры станут гораздо более сговорчивыми, как только мы покажем им ошибки их пути. Это, без сомнения, значительно ускорит интеграцию региона."

TBK_communist_core_warzena:0 "Федеральный округ Майрзим"
TBK_communist_core_warzena_desc:0 "Можно сделать многое с помощью небольшого переименования и значительной административной реструктуризации - к примеру полное преобразование некогда монархического государства в социалистическое. Это, несомненно, впечатляющий подвиг, за который жители Майрзима будут очень благодарны."

TBK_internationale_connections:0 "Всемирная борьба"
TBK_internationale_connections_desc:0 "Что такое социалистическое государство без проведения политики интернационализма и глобальной агитации? Сейча сложно себе представить время более подходящее для экспорта нашей революции в другие страны, в меру наших великих возможностей."

TBK_home_of_revolution:0 "Дом революции"
TBK_home_of_revolution_desc:0 "Воистину, мы являемся тем, чем Сталлионград пока ещё не стал после ухода наших идеологических предков, - глобальной ареной, на которой революция можно восторгаться революцией, а также свободно её распространять. Мир упадка содрогнётся, столкнувшись с мощью федерации!"

TBK_assess_hippogriffia:0 "Изучить Гиппогрифию"
TBK_assess_hippogriffia_desc:0 "Гиппогрифы представляют, пожалуй, самую большую угрозу для нашего великого рая. Их остров прекрасно подходит для обороны, они также хорошо известные своей военной доблестью, а их бойцы внушают страх любому противнику; но сегодня они не победят нашу революцию."

TBK_red_zumidia:0 "Красная Зумидия"
TBK_red_zumidia_desc:0 "Захват Зумидии является обязательным пунктом в достижении установления коммунистической власти в пределах наших естественных границ, и поэтому она должна стать неотъемлемой частью Федерации. Никто не будет противиться нашему освобождению рабочих, которые так долго томились под тиранией гиппогрифов."

TBK_colthage_defences:0 "Северо-восточные укрепления"
TBK_colthage_defences_desc:0 "Риторика Кольтфагена постоянно была враждебной, независимо от того, какой режим находился у власти. Мы мудры, и настороженно относимся к их планам в отношении Зумидии и их амбициям, следовательно, создание линии укреплений вдоль границы с ними является логичным выбором для нашей оборонительной стратегии."

TBK_maregypt_war:0 "Возвращение к источнику"
TBK_maregypt_war_desc:0 "Тобук изначально был создан Мейргипетом; его жители такие же наши братья, как и любые другие существа, и они не забудет ни федерация, ни Хазрумени. Нифтин, в частности, проявил большой интерес к спасению своей родины от упадка, но все согласны с тем, что Мейргипет должен быть свободным!"

TBK_international_war:0 "Хазруменский Освободительный Фронт"
TBK_international_war_desc:0 "Нет более благородной цели, чем бороться за свободу других. Именно этой идеи мы будем придерживаться во время наших грядущих великих битв; Теперь это доктрина социалистического освобождения, противостоящая реакционным силам, сопротивляющимся нашей неизбежной победе!"

TBK_revolutionary_spearhead:0 "На острие революции"
TBK_revolutionary_spearhead_desc:0 "Бронетехника - это не просто полезный инструмент пропаганды, но и эффективная часть современных вооружённых сил. Мы можем дать подразделениям, в которых они используются, как особое название, так и истинную цель в революции!"

TBK_territory_zarantia:0 "Рассеять племена"
TBK_territory_zarantia_desc:0 "Пришло время разобраться с племенами, которые когда-то избегали нас, отбросив Тобук на обочину истории, чтобы избежать гнева Короля Штормов много лет назад. Федерация не забыла об их измене и не намерена позволять Зарантии упорствовать."

TBK_end_sedentary_life:0 "Принуждения к оседлости"
TBK_end_sedentary_life_desc:0 "Кочевников невероятно трудно склонить на свою сторону по ряду причин, главная из которых заключается в том, что в их обществе нет понятия национальной идентичности или объединяющей идеологии. Если мы хотим добиться прогресса в их обществе, то для начала мы должны начать его регулировать."

TBK_end_old_hierarchies:0 "Упразднить Агуэллид"
TBK_end_old_hierarchies_desc:0 "Племенной титул Агуэллид больше не несёт никакой ценности или особого смысла для нашей великой нации. Мы упраздним его, чтобы освободить место для более подходящих должностей в правительстве и административной реструктуризации региона."

TBK_communist_core_zarantia:0 "Федеральные округа Агжат и Зиндер"
TBK_communist_core_zarantia_desc:0 "Можно добиться многого с помощью административной реструктуризации и тщательного перевоспитания. А именно - полного преобразования некогда племенного 'государства' в социалистическое. Это, несомненно, впечатляющий подвиг, за который жители Агжата и Зиндера будут очень благодарны."

TBK_special_forces_focus_desc:0 "С самого начала своей карьеры военачальника Уоллнат всегда питал слабость к войскам специального назначения. К счастью, это тот тип его увлечений, в который стоит инвестировать. Поэтому были выделены средства на повышение их боевой эффективности."

TBK_shadow_strikes_desc:0 "Концентрация сил является определяющей чертой современной доктрины, что делает её стоящей нашего внимания.

TBK_royal_cult_of_personality_desc:0 "Now everyone truly loves His Majesty, so much in fact that he seems to have garnered a particular fan following of especially devoted subjects.

TBK_make_examples:0 "None But Zamal"
TBK_make_examples_desc:0 "One cannot simply allow another to rule over the sovereign lands of the Zamal in his stead. It is His Majesty’s right to claim and to own the land that belongs to him in every capacity and delegating the task to any other would simply be ludicrous."

TBK_zumidia_imperial_domain:0 "Despot of Zumidia"
TBK_zumidia_imperial_domain_desc:0 "Despot of Zumidia is yet another title for our immaculate ruler to embrace after our rightful reclamation of the Zumidian lands.

TBK_two_columns_desc: "Moonspeakers shall no longer simply teach the faith, they shall enforce it, and promote moral virtues among our subjects. We must remain vigilant against decandence and moral decay."

TBK_duties_to_moon: "Every Faithful's Duty"
TBK_duties_to_moon_desc: "One does not have to be in the military to serve the Tsaritsa. Although military service is the highest calling, every subject of the Tsaritsa and every faithful of the Nightmare has a place in the service of their goddess and their realm, whether that be on the frontlines or in the factories."

TBK_communion_nightmare: "Communion To Nightmare"
TBK_communion_nightmare_desc: "Worship of the Nightmare, her hooves touching this world or her gaze watching us from afar, should be conducted with the sanctity that she deserves. Our Goddess will be proud of us, no matter the form she takes."

TBK_eternal_duty: "Eternal Oath"
TBK_eternal_duty_desc: "We shall consult with Lunar Hail to begin crafting the new Legionnaire's Oath, carefully worded to act as both a binding vow of loyalty and a profession of faith. Until we are ready to integrate the old Legions fully, we will begin by demanding this oath from the officers of the Druzhina and the other Tobuckian units, to bind them spiritually to their Tsaritsa."

TBK_jingoism: "Jingoism"
TBK_jingoism_desc: "As an ancient Tsar once said, "Severyana has two friends: the army and the navy." Never has that been more true than today in Novaya Severyana, and like in Chiropterra and old Severyana before us, we will make the army the most important institution of the state, second only to the will of the Tsaritsa herself."

TBK_enshrine_militarism: "The Call of Duty"
TBK_enshrine_militarism_desc: "All must do their part in defence of their country. We will enshrine military service as the highest calling for our subjects, and start a wave of propaganda to drive up enlistment."

TBK_virtue_chivalry: "Virtue of Chivalry"
TBK_virtue_chivalry_desc: "The Druzhina of old Severyana never saw their military service as merely a grim duty to the state, or as just another job. For them, it was a calling, a way to both develop and show their chivalric virtues. We will cultivate this heroic ethos among our soldiers, so that each one of them will welcome the day of battle with joy and celebration."

TBK_druzhina_reform: "Most Noble Druzhina"
TBK_druzhina_reform_desc: "Though the importance of the Druzhina as a part of the military cannot be understated, they have garnered a kind of public respect that makes them perfect for a formal role as police during peacetime. Their leadership will integrate and take over the role of Chiropterran auxiliaries in order to create a force of the size required to police our great nation."

TBK_reinstate_legions: "The Second Founding"
TBK_reinstate_legions_desc: "After their defeat, the Imperial Legions have existed under a cloud of shame. But our victory was the will of The Nightmare, and will result in greater glories than ever before. We shall formally refound the legions, removing the shame of defeat and affirming their eternal loyalty to Empress, country, and Tsaritsa!"

TBK_millenia_experience: "Millennia of Wars"
TBK_millenia_experience_desc: "There is no country in the world with more accumulated military tradition than Chiropterra. We should make use of their expertise to perfect our doctrines."

TBK_youth_thoughts: "Bloom of Change"
TBK_youth_thoughts_desc: "In addition to their experience, the Chiropterrans had among their ranks some of the world's most innovative generals. We should promote these forward-thinkers to our high command so that they can guide us into a new generation of warfare."

TBK_new_imperial_army: "The Second Imperial Army"
TBK_new_imperial_army_desc: "Rejoice! The Imperial Army has been restored, stronger and more faithful than ever. With the Nightmare's blessing and the Tsaritsa's guidance, we cannot fail!"

TBK_alesia_warmistress: "Warmistress of the Imperial Legions"
TBK_alesia_warmistress_desc: "The position of Warmaster shall be reinstated, with Tsaritsa Alesia occupying that illustrious post by unanimous consent of the legion commanders. From now on however, that position will be held for life."

TBK_tsaritsas_own_desc:0 ""I believe in Nightmare Moon, sacred and eternal. I believe in Tsaritsa Alesia, long may she reign. I swear upon my blood and my faith to serve the Tsaritsa in all things, to be her shield, her sword, her instrument as she is the holy instrument of The Nightmare's will. This oath shall bind me until my death, and my service shall be my reward."\n-From the Oath of the Novaya Severyanian Legionnaire"

TBK_sovereign_mother: "Our Sovereign Mother"
TBK_sovereign_mother_desc: "Alesia is, beyond the head of state, the mother of our people. As any mother would, she knows what is best for her children and for her country. We place our faith in her as her loyal subjects and faithful servants as she continues to foster our young nation."

TBK_fanatical_charge: "Nightmare's With Us!"
TBK_fanatical_charge_desc: "If the faithful should find themselves outnumbered and cut off, they will still have their faith. That faith will send them charging forth, either to the other side of the enemy's lines or into The Nightmare's embrace."

TBK_military_innovations: "Much Needed Upgrades"
TBK_military_innovations_desc: "Our soldiers need far better weapons than they have used thus far. For that, we must make the massive military-scientific base of Chiropterra into the core of our research apparatus, rather than the paltry facilities available in Tobuck."

TBK_infantry_primacy: "Tools of Infantrymare"
TBK_infantry_primacy_desc: "The infantry will always be the backbone of the Imperial Army. We should focus our efforts on providing them the finest equipment, so that they will never fail in their duties to Nightmare and Tsaritsa."

TBK_tank_plane_desigs: "Severyan Innovators"
TBK_tank_plane_desigs_desc: "Heretical as they are, the blasted communists are years ahead of us in tank and aircraft design. Some of the White Exiles who have recently arrived claim to have "acquired" certain blueprints of the latest Severyan designs. We should fund their proposals to build our own variants of these war machines."

TBK_pardon_lmrd: "Imperial Curative Sciences Faculty"
TBK_pardon_lmrd_desc: "The LMRD was a ghastly organization, but that was because they lacked the Tsaritsa's guidance and spent their time on mad side-projects. By adopting a more pragmatic, results-oriented approach, the new Imperial Curative Sciences Faculty can redeem these astray scientists by having them research projects of genuine use to the Tsaritsa."

TBK_realm_expansion_plan: "Natural Borders"
TBK_realm_expansion_plan_desc: "The Chiropterran expansion plans were flawed, but only because of their lack of the Tsaritsa's guidance, rather than their intent. We will prepare a series of conquests to bring our neighbours into the fold, bringing much needed order to this chaotic land."

TBK_warzena_integration: "Protectorate of Zamivgazal"
TBK_warzena_integration_desc: "We will establish a new protectorate in Warzena, named the Protectorate of Zamivgazal, to integrate these lands into our structure of governance. Warzenans who prove themselves loyal and adapt to the Novaya Severyanian ethos will form the basis for a new nobility in the Protectorate."

TBK_reopen_river_trade: "Flow of Trade"
TBK_reopen_river_trade_desc: "Once, there was rich trade along the rivers of Warzena, but the loss of Tobuck and the diplomatic crisis with Zarantia dried up that trade. Now under the Tsaritsa's watchful eye, trade can once again flow along these rivers, with the addition of Chiropterran goods which they once witheld from the locals."

TBK_hippogriffian_zebralands: "Drive Them to Sea"
TBK_hippogriffian_zebralands_desc: "There can be only one great power in these lands, and so long as the Hippogriffs have a clawhold on the mainland our dominance will never be assured. The task ahead seems daunting, but with the Tsaritsa's guidance and the Nightmare's blessing, we cannot fail!"

TBK_add_to_vassal_control: "Award Zirta"
TBK_add_to_vassal_control_desc: "Out of the districts of Zumidia, Zirta is proving the easiest to administer due to its relatively rural, conservative population and its close proximity to our previous conquests. We will name it the County of Zirta, and award it to a loyal vassal."

TBK_caravan_priviliges: "Imperial Caravan Trust"
TBK_caravan_priviliges_desc: "We will grant trans-Zebharan trading privileges to select loyal merchants. With the infrastructure of our Realm supporting them, soon they will bring back great wealth to our nation."

TBK_invasion_ports: "The Grand Dockyards"
TBK_invasion_ports_desc: "In order to properly compete with the hippogriffs, we must dramatically expand our dockyards and commission a vast fleet of innovative new vessels. Soon they will no longer be the sole power in North Zebrican waters..."

TBK_battleship_ponymkin: "Battleship Ponymkin"
TBK_battleship_ponymkin_desc: "The Tsaritsa has approved the secret construction of the largest, most powerful battleship the world has ever seen: the Battleship Ponymkin. Soon all will stand in awe at our might."

TBK_zarantia_integration: "Shizra Confederation"
TBK_zarantia_integration_desc: "The Zarantians are known as an ungovernable people, but that is not so. Their confederal model can be coopted with a few promises and a few bribes to the right zebras, so long as we do not expect them to show more loyalty than simply paying their admittedly-low taxes and fighting in our armies."

TBK_zebra_cossacks: "Imperial Yasani"
TBK_zebra_cossacks_desc: "Zarantians have a strong mercenary tradition and a long history of nomadism. By recruiting select Zarantian tribes to serve as mobile border patrol units, affording them extra pay and the right to wear distinctive culturally-inspired uniforms, we can get a rapid-response force capable of bringing the most distant frontiers off our realm to heel."

TBK_nationalism: "Fidelity"
TBK_nationalism_desc: "Every subject of our realm must be true to their Tsaritsa, to their homeland, and to its traditions. It is only through a strict Fidelity to these things that a nation remains strong and free of decadence."

TBK_old_chiropterran_governance: "Territories of Old Order"
TBK_old_chiropterran_governance_desc: "Chiropterra is a proud and mighty land, with its own traditions of governance built up over a millennium of struggle and sacrifice. We will integrate it into our tsardom as the Realm of Chiropterra, and while there is much to be done to smooth out the contradictions in Chiropterra, we shall endeavour to leave as much of that venerable state intact as possible."

TBK_remnants_tobuck_government: "Ruins of Late Republic"
TBK_remnants_tobuck_government_desc: "The Republic of Tobuck was a wretched place, and not only because it was a republic. But against all odds, its denizens pulled through and won what was supposed to be an impossible victory. We will integrate them into our tsardom as the Grand Duchy of Tobuck, forever honoured as the people who delivered our Tsaritsa to her throne."

TBK_tsarist_order: "Her Imperial Sovereign's Lands"
TBK_tsarist_order_desc: "The Tsaritsa's rule extends not only to the people of Novaya Severyana, but to the soil as well. We will not collectivize as the red scum do, nor guarantee private property as the snivelling Harmonists do. All land in the Grand Duchy of Tobuck and the Realm of Chiropterra shall be legally owned by Tsaritsa Alesia, to be held and used by her assent."

TBK_tsaritsas_hoof: "The Tsaritsa's Hoof"
TBK_tsaritsas_hoof_desc: "The Nightmare's Hoof was one of the finest, if not the finest spy agency in the world. We should find the agents of this noble institution and recruit them back into the fold, so that the enemies of the Tsaritsa will never be able to keep secrets from her."

TBK_military_agents: "On Foreign Mansions"
TBK_military_agents_desc: "The Tsaritsa's Hoof should focus its efforts on foreign intelligence, as the Nightmare's Hoof did before it. This will give us an edge in any future conflicts, whether against our neighbours or against the communist worms occupying Severyana."

TBK_public_purpose: "On Home Streets"
TBK_public_purpose_desc: "The Tsaritsa's Hoof should focus its efforts on domestic surveillance. That way it can function as a powerful tool to root out corruption, dissent, and all other things which would weaken the state and the reign of the Tsaritsa."

TBK_codex_alesia: "Alesia Pravda"
TBK_codex_alesia_desc: "Tsaritsa Alesia has introduced a new code of laws to rationalize, streamline, and simplify the complex legal codes which have accumulated over the last milennium in Chiropterra, as well as bringing the once-lawless Grand Duchy of Tobuck in line with the standards of law and order of our realm."

TBK_labour_reform: "Issue of Labourers"
TBK_labour_reform_desc: "The Chiropterran Labourers do not fall neatly into our societal structure. Recognising this, the Tsaritsa now deliberates over what is to be done with this misbegotten caste of workers."

TBK_chiropterran_tone: "The New Homeland"
TBK_chiropterran_tone_desc: "Despite our differences, the Tsaritsa has seen it fit to induct members of the Chiropterran elite into her court. Their experience in economic centralism and social engineering on a mass scale make them uniquely qualified for our new administration."

TBK_autocracy: "Autocracy"
TBK_autocracy_desc: "Ultimate temporal authority must be invested in a single ruler, and it is irrevocable save by the decree of the Nightmare Herself. The great pyramid of authority must have a summit, and that summit must be a single autocrat, for a divided state cannot stand."

TBK_severyan_tone: "The Old Severyana"
TBK_severyan_tone_desc: "Thus far the expatriates from Severyana have proven themselves invaluable in the construction of the new administration. It is only fitting that they should be rewarded for their marvellous work and that we should further expand the repatriation program in order to facilitate future expansions of the state."

TBK_social_elements: "Elements of Imperialism"
TBK_social_elements_desc: "While the Equestrian Elements of Harmony are partially responsible for weakening Severyana and leaving it open to communism, the fundamental idea of enumerating a set of virtues as guiding principles for the state is a good one. We will enumerate our own set of "Elements," to act as the moral guides for the Tsaritsa's government."

TBK_element_order: "Element of Order"
TBK_element_order_desc: "The Element of Order refers to the fundamental value in obeying your superiors, following orders, and respecting the hierarchies you live under. It is distinct from the Equestrian Element of Loyalty because it does not orient itself around on personal connections, but around strict duties."

TBK_element_will: "Element of Will"
TBK_element_will_desc: "The Element of Will refers to the virtue to be found in imposing your will upon the world, and therefore lends itself naturally to the captains of industry as well as the high officials of state."

TBK_state_capitalism: "Charter of Corporatives"
TBK_state_capitalism_desc: "Whilst incredibly efficient, the economic model that the Chiropterrans have made extensive use of is not entirely appropriate for the subjects of the Tsaritsa. Much of the state-controlled industry shall be split between existing corporations with the intent to decentralise, if only slightly, the stratocratic methods of our new citizens."

TBK_military_industries_focus: "Arms For the Empire"
TBK_military_industries_focus_desc: "We will continue the Chiropterran policy of manufacturing only such consumer goods as are absolutely necessary. The bulk of our industry shall go towards supplying the legions."

TBK_establish_civilian_sector: "Products For the Subjects"
TBK_establish_civilian_sector_desc: "Our Tobuckian subjects are not used to the austere life the Chiropterran legionnaires lived. Accordingly, we will use some of our industry to manufacture consumer goods for our subjects to keep them happy, well-fed and prosperous."

TBK_element_honour: "Element of Honour"
TBK_element_honour_desc: "The Element of Honour refers to upholding the duties and dignity of one's station with upright zeal. It differs from the Element of Honesty in that the meaning of Honour is heavily dependent on your social station: the Honour of the labourer is to work, while the Honour of the soldier is to fight, and the Honour of the Tsaritsa is to rule."

TBK_crown_scouts: "Organisation of Moon Rangers"
TBK_crown_scouts_desc: "Chiropterran youth are largely left to their own devices, their parents and local youth programs entrusted to instill good values in them. While this worked well when Chiropterra was a thousand year old stratocracy, given recent cultural changes it would be best to centralize these youth programs to ensure they inculcate not only faith in The Nightmare, but also a zealous devotion to the Tsaritsa."

TBK_element_authority: "Element of Authority"
TBK_element_authority_desc: "The Element of Authority refers to the central importance of leaders to recognize their own right to lead, granted by the Tsaritsa, and not to shy away from doing what it takes to maintain proper hierarchy and respect for superiors."

TBK_loyal_education: "Faithful Curriculum"
TBK_loyal_education_desc: "Our school curricula must teach the true history of our tsardom: from the glory of old Severyana, to the fall at the hooves of the sun and the communists, to the parallel exiles of the Nightmare's Legions and the Tsaritsa herself, to the glorious present and the bright future."

TBK_diploma_program: "Imperial Diplomas"
TBK_diploma_program_desc: "We will standardise our higher education program, collecting the qualifications of our realm's best and brightest into a system of imperial diplomas. This will streamline scientific research significantly."

TBK_arch_enemy_communism: "Death To Marksism!"
TBK_arch_enemy_communism_desc: "There was one pony in history more evil than the usurper Celestia. Her name was Caramel Marks. Not only does her doctrine deny the Nightmare's right to rule, it denies monarchy itself and seeks to destroy all the noble traditions of this world. Marksists are anathema, and there is no higher honour than to destroy the red devils."

TBK_severyan_curriculum: "Severyan Language Act"
TBK_severyan_curriculum_desc: "Wer will fund new courses to teach Severyanian in our schools, with those who have completed Severyanian courses given a competitive edge in attaining promotions in the government and military."

TBK_table_nobility: "Ranks Of Nobility"
TBK_table_nobility_desc: "Tsaritsa Alesia has ordered a census of the noble families of Chiropterra, such that the accumulated privileges and duties of the last thousand years can be collected, defined, and standardized into a clear ranking scheme."

TBK_traditonal_social_order: "Traditional Social Order"
TBK_traditonal_social_order_desc: "For all the laudable discipline of their military hierarchy, Chiropterran civil society is distressingly egalitarian. Other than a few aristocratic families whose role is mainly honourary, the faithful are largely treated as equals. We must rectify this situation by codifying hereditary social castes with distinct rights and responsibilites, all working for the glory of The Nightmare and the Tsaritsa."

TBK_severyan_culture: "Love Of Severyana"
TBK_severyan_culture_desc: "Severyanian culture was a magnificent thing, blending together elegance and austerity, form and function, bombast and tranquility. That was before the usurper Celestia diluted it and the communist iconoclasts destroyed it. And yet it shall be again: we shall organize festivals and holidays to inculcate in our people a love of Severyana's traditions and beauty."

TBK_severya_primacy: "Severyana Above All!"
TBK_severya_primacy_desc: "Through hard work and careful social engineering, we have brought back Severyanian culture from the brink of extinction. Though the communists would see it slain, we have brought Severyanian traditions back, stronger than ever!"

TBK_spirit_of_alexander_desc: "In honour of our glorious ancestor, we will raise two new "Snezhinskaya" divisions of Druzhina from the former legionnaires of mighty Chiropterra."

TBK_absolute_authority: "Her Will Be Done"
TBK_absolute_authority_desc: "As The Nightmare's chosen, Tsaritsa Alesia rules through divine right. Her word is the law of the land. Her every order shall be understood as the will of the realm, to be followed as unquestioningly as if The Nightmare Herself had willed it."

TBK_ursagrad_capital: "My Snezhnograd"
TBK_ursagrad_capital_desc: "Ursagrad occupies a key position between the Chiropterran Realm and the Grand Duchy of Tobuck, and its history as being founded by the Severyanian Ursa Legion would reinforce that aspect of our Tsardom's character. Many inhabitants even speak an ancient dialect of Severyanian. Tsaritsa Alesia shall make Ursagrad her capital, renamed in honour of her glorious ancestor Alexander Snezhinsky."

TBK_royal_patronage: "Arts Of the Court"
TBK_royal_patronage_desc: "Tsaritsa Alesia does not hoard the wealth of the realm as Griffon kings do. She has taken it upon herself to uplift a new generation of patriotic artists with her patronage, so that the splendour of Novaya Severyana may be reflected in works of transcendent beauty."

TBK_royal_example: "Through Her Example"
TBK_royal_example_desc: "Tsaritsa Alesia has no tolerance for decadence or waste. While her palace shall be grand, its decorations shall be strictly devotional, and she herself shall be clad in an austere uniform at all times. Through her example, our subjects will learn to stay clear of the wastrel's vices."

TBK_court_tsaritsa: "Court of Stars"
TBK_court_tsaritsa_desc: "The Tsaritsa will set up a grand throneroom, where she will hold a magnificent court that one day will beggar even that of the usurper Celestia. Foreign dignitaries and Novaya Severyanian nobles alike will be in awe of the Court of Stars."

TBK_palace_estates: "Tsaritsy Polya"
TBK_palace_estates_desc: "We will develop the fertile lands around our palace as the personal demesne of the Tsaritsa. It will provide for her vast household, as well as covering a significant portion of the expenses of state."

TBK_severyan_customs: "Grand Winter Gala"
TBK_severyan_customs_desc: "The tsars of Old Severyana would host great galas on the longest night of the year. They would invite all the nobles and a few lucky commoners to their palaces, where they would put aside their differences and celebrate the beauty of winter and of the night. We shall revive this tradition, and invite the nobles of Chiropterra to pay homage to the Tsaritsa and the Nightmare."

TBK_safeguard_communities: "Rights of Commoners"
TBK_safeguard_communities_desc: "Communist filth claim that by enforcing a class system we are guaranteeing poverty. Like everything else they say, this is a lie. The commoners shall be cared for, and so long as they fulfill their duties, they need never know hunger."

TBK_priviliges_aristocracy: "Duties of Aristocracy"
TBK_priviliges_aristocracy_desc: "In Griffonia, perhaps, or under the usurper Celestia, the aristocracy are lazy layabouts sucking the bloated corpse of the state. Not in old Severyana, not in Chiropterra, and not in Novaya Severyana. The aristocracy will have important martial duties to fulfill, with the lesser gentry fighting in the Legions and the higher nobles using their wealth to support the army."

TBK_imperial_bureaucracy: "Bureaucracy of the Tsardom"
TBK_imperial_bureaucracy_desc: "We will extend our bureaucracy to govern every portion of our realm, to ensure that all proceeds according to the will of the Nightmare and the command of the Tsaritsa."

TBK_resurrected_severyana: "Severyana Has Endured!"
TBK_resurrected_severyana_desc: "Against all odds we have not only preserved what we once thought lost in Severyana, but we have revived it in the most glorious fashion. The light of our homeland burns bright, fuelled anew by our revanchism and loyalty to the Tsaritsa and the Nightmare!"

TBK_perfect_synthesis: "Perfect Synthesis"
TBK_perfect_synthesis_desc: "In spite of the great challenges we have faced, there now exists a unqiue and unbreakable bond between Chiropterran and Severyan culture and society. Though there is much left to be done, the Tsaritsa's loyal subjects will never again consider themselves separate; we have achieved an ideal unlike any other."

### Military post-tree

TBK_republic_armed_forces: "Army of the Republic"
TBK_republic_armed_forces_desc: "Tobuck was never really meant to act as a real country but here we are. We have nothing but bodyguards, mercenaries and scared conscripts next to a mish-mash of guns and not always assorted ammunition. Time to make an army out of it. But we'll manage. How hard can it all really be?"

TBK_construct_military_academy: "War College of Tobuck"
TBK_construct_military_academy_desc: "Well. Since we no longer rely on mercenaries and shall we say decentralized forces, we need to learn and teach how to maintain and organize an army. Now. We can't afford to go slow and meticulously build a proud and long-standing officer corp tradition. Time for some crash courses!"

TBK_quality_leadership: "Strength Through Quality"
TBK_quality_leadership_desc: "When in war, you need to learn what your strengths and vulnerabilities are. So while we are not that small of a country, we will be outnumbered. However, by focusing on training a good officer corps, we can make sure that our proficiencies in weaponry are used in the most efficient way possible. No waste of bullets or ponies!"

TBK_additional_manpower: "Fill the Ranks"
TBK_additional_manpower_desc: "When outnumbered, the best bet is to try and even the score. So there are more of them than there are of us but by the transitive properties of us knowing how to get our hooves on a lot of guns and ammos, we should be able to make sure that we kill enough of them so that we can take them! That's math. Who ever said that war was hard?"

TBK_magic_ponies: "War Can Be Magic Too!"
TBK_magic_ponies_desc: "Northern Zebrica is hardly a center of magical knowledge but we do have unicorns. Now granted, very few of them have even shown an inkling towards violence and normally, that would be good. However, we'll need to teach them to go from magical cake making to battlefield shield generation if we want to get an edge in the trenches."

TBK_radio_development: "Radio R&D"
TBK_radio_development_desc: "Our enemies have had years to prepare for an invasion and they'll have a slew of tactics to take us on. So we need to establish clear and excellent lines of communication for our units if we want to be able to adapt quickly and safely! Lucky for us, our smuggler friends know a thing or two about radio and encrypted communications!"

TBK_standard_rifles: "Commission New Battle Rifle"
TBK_standard_rifles_desc: "Now here's a conundrum, how do gun runners arm a standardized army? Well the answer is that it's a nightmare. You need factories, ammo, a supply line and all of it needs to be efficient with a much lower profit margin. But we made our bed and we need modern rifles if we want to kill whoever wants to lay in that bloody bed!"

TBK_new_leaders: "In Service Of the Republic"
TBK_new_leaders_desc: "With the warlords gone, we need to build up the Republican Guard and quickly. But more importantly, we need sane and loyal ponies to lead it. We're going to need to do a whole lot of performance review to find somepony capable in that sorry lot of an army. I mean, we are looking for the best of the best! Which is still a low bar here."

TBK_hire_griffonian_experts: "Hire Griffonian Instructors"
TBK_hire_griffonian_experts_desc: "When it comes to war, you can never go wrong with hiring some Griffonian veterans. That continent has been in turmoil ever since somegriff lost a trinket and Kemerskai broke everything. Some of them must surely be interested in working in a warmer climate for some exceptional pay. Just make sure the other officers don't learn how much."

TBK_establish_national_militia: "Rapid-Response Militia"
TBK_establish_national_militia_desc: "Not mentioning the internal risks to the republic, neither Zarantia, Warzena or Chiropterra can be described as being thrilled with us breathing. With such angry neighbours, we need. Let us set up local teams of minuteponies with some basic training and equipment to hold off the enemy until the army can arrive on the battlefield."

TBK_plan_militia_resistance: "Militia Battle Order X1"
TBK_plan_militia_resistance_desc: "The minuteponies can only do so much and so we need to accept that they'll fold if the army is delayed in any way. So let's work with that knowledge. Rather than sell an idea of fighting to the death to simple citizens, we'll instruct them to disperse before it's too late, disturb enemy movements and support refugees so as to not clog the roads and bridges."

TBK_army_grand_battleplan: "Central Army HQ"
TBK_army_grand_battleplan_desc: "The entire Republic rests upon a single center of command. If Tobuck falls, there is no hope of falling back. Therefore, our entire military doctrine must be to delay, stop and destroy anything that is on its way towards the capital. "

TBK_proper_trenches: "Shovel In Every Hoof"
TBK_proper_trenches_desc: "They say that there are two kinds of ponies: those who dig and those who have a gun. What they forget is that there's a third kind of pony: the one who pays. So you get both a shovel and a gun and if you want to live, you better dig those trenches like there's no tomorrow! We're not running a playground here!"

TBK_special_engineer_training: "Special-Engineer Courses"
TBK_special_engineer_training_desc: "It turns out that simply digging trenches is not as easy as it sounds like. There's a whole art in standardizing them and making them fit for combat, housing and logistical support. We better start selecting a few lucky ponies who will get the prized honor of supervising others doing the digging."

TBK_fortification_program: "Fortress-Republic"
TBK_fortification_program_desc: "Tobuck was never in the spot of defending itself and it shows. We won't be safe without some massive investment into our infrastructure. We need military depots, casemates, forts in any strategic positions and most importantly, the means of moving our troops and equipment around quickly and efficiently."

TBK_killzone_tactics: "Killzone Tactics"
TBK_killzone_tactics_desc: "With our limited supply of soldiers, we will have holes in our lines but we can transform this weakness into a strength by drawing our enemies in less defended open fields where we can blaze them from our stronger positions and then mop them up using our few mobile units."

TBK_masterwork_trenches: "Impenetrable Defence"
TBK_masterwork_trenches_desc: "We have a solid basis but we need to do more if we want to have any chance of withholding a major offensive. Send concrete to the trenches. Plant landmines in the killzones. Improve coordination between the artillery and the field engineers. Make every inch of terrain a Tartarus to go through! The line must hold!"

TBK_army_superior_firepower: "Battlefield Destruction"
TBK_army_superior_firepower_desc: "The Republic was born in a pile of guns surrounded by ponies who knew how to use them. This is where we came from and this will be how we prevail through the worst of storms! More guns. More firepower. And make sure they'll only pry them from our cold dead hooves!"

TBK_introduce_cannons: "Discard the Bombards"
TBK_introduce_cannons_desc: "Too many of our soldiers are still accustomed to old artillery pieces better suited for a museum than for the battlefield. It's partly on us as Pea Shooter ordered the best cannons to be sold internationally. Well, that's over. Soldiers? Forget about blackpowder, smoke and cannonballs. Meet the shell and the howitzer. Ain't they a beauty?"

TBK_anti_armor_aid: "Pierce All Armour"
TBK_anti_armor_aid_desc: "The tank is all the range nowadays. It'll be a long time for us to have the industry to produce them reliably for domestic use. However we can learn how to penetrate them. And if we do, that's where we'll be happy to be a small country. There'll be no going around for them. So let's wreck some armor!"

TBK_endless_steel_rain: "Explosive Forecast"
TBK_endless_steel_rain_desc: "A good cannon can hit a target and kill it. A better cannon will hit multiple targets at once and make sure that they're either dead or unfit for combat. And that my friends is how a small country negates the power of demographics. Hey, you! I hope you brought an umbrella!"

TBK_chemical_deterrence: "Chemical Deterrence"
TBK_chemical_deterrence_desc: "At some point in time, in a wretched place, the very worst of matchmakers had the idea of bringing chemistry and ballistics together. However, in Tobuck, we've learned to make the best out of the worst and we'll be damned if we're not making good use of anything that makes our guns deadlier. Now, carry those barrels with care."

TBK_proud_army: "Proud Foals of \nthe Republic"
TBK_proud_army_desc: "It was a difficult endeavour but we've never been afraid of difficulties. Now, a new generation of ponies is entering the barracks of the Republican Army of Tobuck and what they are finding isn't a slapped-together mess anymore. The era of warlords is well and truly over. Now stands an army, proud and strong!"

TBK_warlords_army: "Warlords of Tobuck"
TBK_warlords_army_desc: "Hey, warlords aren't so bad. Keep 'em paid, keep 'em armed, and they'll fight for anycreature, even a crook like Vasile. Pea's problem was he was a cheapskate who paid them all ad hoc and never signed a decent contract. That won't be an issue for us."

TBK_army_mobile_warfare: "Relentless Pursuit"
TBK_army_mobile_warfare_desc: "A decentralised mercenary force can move as fast as tartarus if given the right incentives. No need for elaborate chains of command, just offer a bonus to the first ones to the fight, and to any lower-level officer who shows daring and initiative. Boom. Instant blitzkrieg."

TBK_increase_military_production: "State Military-Industrial Complex"
TBK_increase_military_production_desc: "We need some proper factories if we're gonna make all this equipment. Yes, it'll be expensive, but absolutely nothing has a higher long-term profit margin than weapons."

TBK_trucks_galore: "Faster Than Anypony"
TBK_trucks_galore_desc: "You know what's faster than a speeding pegasus? A speeding truck. Let's motorize as much of our army as we can. It'll let 'em maneuver faster it'll let 'em carry more gear, and it'll let 'em carry off more loot once the fighting is done. So long as they give us a cut for the truck..."

TBK_add_armour_to_trucks: "Protect the Engines"
TBK_add_armour_to_trucks_desc: "Bullets and gasoline don't mix. Fortunately, we have a lot of scrap metal and a lot of ponies who'd be willing to do some dubiously-safe welding work for a quick buck. Who said making armoured vehicles was hard?"

TBK_get_some_tanks: "Hire the Gryphon Company" 
TBK_get_some_tanks_desc: "There's armoured vehicles, and then there's proper armour. For that, we gotta pay. Fortunately, Vasile has some contacts in Griffonia who have some proper hardware. Let's see if the bats and their fancy training can get through this..."

TBK_raider_trucks: "Leave ´em In Dust!"
TBK_raider_trucks_desc: "Our mercenaries have really taken to these trucks! They've given them names, spraypainted all sorts of things on them, and upgunned them well beyond the bounds of common sense. Firepower, mobility, and a symbol to rally around: what's not to love?"

TBK_army_mass_assault: "Lust For Loot"
TBK_army_mass_assault_desc: "If there's one thing Tobuck has a limitless supply of, it's greed. They've all seen how rich you can get off scavenging and gun-running, so if we give them the cheapest guns we can find and then promise to let them pick their foes (and their friends!) clean, we'll barely have to pay 'em!"

TBK_actual_guns: "Locked and Loaded"
TBK_actual_guns_desc: "So what if Pea Shooter sold most of the Storm King's old guns? Who needs 'em? I heard you can put together a submachine gun out of piping and sheet metal in a backyard welding shop. Oh, fine, we'll also buy some rifles. What is Tobuck coming to that we have to import weapons?"

TBK_abundant_recruits: "Everyone's a Mercenary"
TBK_abundant_recruits_desc: "Can you hold a gun? Would you hold this one? Would you stand over there and shoot anypony who comes near for a few bits? Congrats, you're a mercenary! Who knew recruitment could be so simple?"

TBK_frenzied_horde: "Drugs and Booze For All!"
TBK_frenzied_horde_desc: "You mix some old-fashioned black powder into rum, that's pirate's brew. You mix some smokeless powder and cocaine, that's brown-brown. You drink some pirate's brew and snort some brown-brown, you'll be the most fearless pony alive!"

TBK_glory_to_deluge: "What's Yours Is Mine!"
TBK_glory_to_deluge_desc: "We're declaring open season on the enemy's... everything. The promise of unrestricted plunder will attract more lowlifes and rabble to our army, and nothing's more dangerous than a low-life with a gun and a motive."

TBK_victory_celebrations: "Endless Triumphs"
TBK_victory_celebrations_desc: "Hired guns love being told they've done a good job. We'll festoon them with medals, shower them with booze, and pretty soon our army will have the best morale in Zebrica!"

TBK_bring_abord_new_folk: "The Warzenan Fellows"
TBK_bring_abord_new_folk_desc: "What's better than a mercenary band willing to work for you? A mercenary band with an infamous leader who's willing to work for you, that's what! This 'Captain Z' might need some time to adjust, but new blood is always welcome!"

TBK_gather_weapons: "Grab All the Guns"
TBK_gather_weapons_desc: "There's more than enough guns still stashed in Tobuck to arm our forces, we just have to find them. Search the houses, order of the president. Search the sewers, the junkyards, search and grab every firearm and every bullet you can find!"

TBK_mercenary_gunsmiths: "Knick-Knack Smiths"
TBK_mercenary_gunsmiths_desc: "Mercenaries love their weapons, and they love personalising and customising them. Some spend so much time on their weapons, they become better gunsmiths than the actual gunsmiths! We should offer these fellows new jobs,away from the front lines, making weapons for their old squadmates."

TBK_capture_machines: "Grab Some Vehicles"
TBK_capture_machines_desc: "We've got cutpurses, we've got congriffs, we've got bandits, and soon enough we'll have carjackers too! We'll send our troops out to "acquire" some vehicles, doesn't matter the condition, and refurbish them into supply trucks and troop transports."

TBK_organised_scavenging: "Organised Scavenging"
TBK_organised_scavenging_desc: "Why make when you can take? We will gather the gunsmithing gurus of the mercenary bands together, and create a set of manuals on how best to scavenge and refurbish captured equipment, whether you got it from the enemy or a scrapheap or your own grandmother."

TBK_mercenaries_command: "All-Mercenaries Command"
TBK_mercenaries_command_desc: "Our troops are enthusiastic, but it takes more than enthusiasm to win wars. We'll have to organize them into a centralized command structure if we want to pull of anything but the most rudimentary of operations."

TBK_payment_policy: "Specify Payment"
TBK_payment_policy_desc: "We have a lot of mercenary contracts, and the last thing we want is to accidentally break one of them through carelessness. That's how you get shot. We'll gather together the bookkeepers of the republic's bureaucracy and some of our old money launderers to keep track of all these contracts, making sure our payments are on-time and dependable."

TBK_drive_up_recruitment: "Enlist Now To the Free Forces!"
TBK_drive_up_recruitment_desc: "Why die for patriotism when you can die for money? Okay, that's a bad way of putting it, but it's the core of our sales pitch. Soldiers of more legitimate states struggle to get by and have to follow rigid discipline. In Tobuck, you get all the benefits of going bandit without anycreature calling you a bandit! Not to your face at least."

TBK_hill_warfare: "Hire the Tefe-Band"
TBK_hill_warfare_desc: "Mountain specialists? Well, Tobuck doesn't have many mountains... Ah well, they'll probably be useful for something in the future; let's hire them and get what expertise we can!"

TBK_jungle_warfare: "Hire the Zhevestes"
TBK_jungle_warfare_desc: "Jungle runners will certainly have their uses in the... The very expansive jungles of Tobuck. Hmm. Well, guerrilla warfare experts are always welcome here; let's bring them into our big mercenary family!"

TBK_desert_warfare: "Hire the Zodh Duners"
TBK_desert_warfare_desc: "Now, desert raiders are going to really help us out. Frankly it's incredible that we hadn't hired creatures with skills already, but there's no time like the present to finally plug a hole in our forces' capabilities!"

TBK_gather_shared_experiences: "Shared Tales and Pains"
TBK_gather_shared_experiences_desc: "If there is one thing that can be garnered from pain and suffering, it is how to avoid experiencing it a second time. We can learn a lot from our soldiers and their commanding officers, and so we should if we want to ensure they don't all die to more conventional armies."

TBK_some_equipment_standartisation: "Bring Old Units Up-To-Date"
TBK_some_equipment_standartisation_desc: "Whilst our current guns are good enough, they can be better. Why not figure out how these new weapons work and then make them ourselves, or use their parts to improve our stockpiles? better guns means a cleaner payday after all!"

TBK_rough_scarred: "The Rough and \nScarred Scum"
TBK_rough_scarred_desc: "What we lack in profressionalism we make up for in experience and our soldiers have the scars to prove just how much they've seen and done. Our bands are mighty regiments of battle-hardened soldiers, inspiring fear in their enemies with their brutality and discipline."

TBK_air_force_start: "Первый авиационный взвод" ###Nidwt
TBK_air_force_start_desc: "То, что Тобук был известен своим огромным количеством оружия, не означает, что мы не можем попробовать сделать с ним что-то другое! Если мы найдем несколько самолётов и приклеим к ним наши пушки, у нас тут же появятся настоящие военно-воздушные силы!"

TBK_air_superiority_focus: "Битвы в облаках" ###Nidwt
TBK_air_superiority_focus_desc: "Для наших молодых ВВС очень важно научить наших пилотов выбирать битву. Отдавая предпочтение уничтожению слабых вражеских самолётов и уходу с линии огня более сильных, они не только доживут до нового дня, но и будут лучше выполнять свои задания!"

TBK_ground_support_focus: "Атака сверху" ###Nidwt
TBK_ground_support_focus_desc: "Стрельба по земле так же важна, как и стрельба по другим самолётам. Наши будущие лётчики-асы должны пройти дополнительную подготовку, чтобы их обязанности выполнялись приемлемым образом."

TBK_cas_planes: "Проектирование штурмовиков" ###Nidwt
TBK_cas_planes_desc: "Конечно, все тренировки в мире не принесут пользы, если нет самолёта, на котором могли бы летать наши специализированные пилоты. Нам удалось раздобыть несколько чертежей базового штурмовика. Возможно, в будущем наши инженеры смогут построить более совершенный самолёт."

TBK_aquire_more_fighters: "Создание дополнительные эскадрильи"
TBK_aquire_more_fighters_desc: "Хотя правительство и предпочитало не тратить деньги их казны даже в худшие времена, если мы хотим создать военно-воздушные силы практически с нуля, нам придётся закупать самолеты, чтобы пополнить ряды ВВС. По крайней мере, правительство, вероятно, сможет получить их в кредит и таким образом, значительно снизить траты!"

TBK_naval_bombers: "Крыло морских бомбардировщиков" ###Nidwt
TBK_naval_bombers_desc: "К сожалению для нас, одной из вещей, о которых нам придётся беспокоиться, является блокировка наших портов. По совпадению, один из наших инженеров придумал отличное решение: новый тип бомбардировщика, разработанный специально для уничтожения кораблей."

TBK_air_academy: "Тактика воздушного боя" ###Nidwt
TBK_air_academy_desc: "Какая удача! К нам обратилась бывшая "рабочая" из Хироптерры и заявила, что когда-то она была одним из лучших пилотов в Эквестрии. Она попросила безопасного проезда на родину. Мы согласились, но в обмен она обязалась дать несколько уроков нашим пилотам."

TBK_bomber_developments: "Проектирование бомбардировщиков" ###Nidwt
TBK_bomber_developments_desc: "Недавно до нас дошло новое открытие: По словам одного из наших советников, наши соседи уделяют большое внимание разработке лучших и более разрушительных бомбардировщиков. Услышав об этом, наш лидер приказал сосредоточится на разработке лучших бомбардировщиков, чтобы мы не остались позади."

TBK_air_force_final: "Асы Северной Зебрики" ###Nidwt
TBK_air_force_final_desc: "Тобук! Известный своими поставками оружия, получил новую отличительную черту... пока ещё только зарождающиеся ВВС! Мы даже начали привлекать некоторых авиационных экспертов из других стран. Пусть наша страна и прошла долгий путь за такое короткое время, нам ещё многому предстоит научиться, пока мы продолжаем строить настоящие военно-воздушные силы. По крайней мере, наши пилоты могут сравниться по мастерству с нашими более развитыми соседями."

TBK_air_assembly_line: "Государственная авиастроительная компания" ###Nidwt
TBK_air_assembly_line_desc: "Удивительно, но в последнее время появился новый бизнес, посвящённый авиации. Возможно, с некоторыми инвестициями, мы могли бы убедить их помочь в обслуживании наших самолётов. У них были проблемы с удержанием в полёте."

TBK_radar_development: "Р.А.Д.А.Р" ###Nidwt
TBK_radar_development_desc: "Рации—связь будущего! И, по-видимому, они отлично подходят для получения информации о том, что замышляет враг! Может быть, мы могли бы построить несколько новых вышек вокруг Тобука, если бы кто-нибудь потрудился сделать для них чертежи."

### Navy Tree

TBK_navy_start: "Пристани Тобука"  ###Nidwt
TBK_navy_start_desc: "Что вы имеете в виду, когда говорите, что наши доки предназначены только для торговли? Это абсурд, Король Шторм использовал Тобук как склад оружия, и вполне разумно, что наши верфи тоже используются для войны."

TBK_cruiser_focus: "Изучить планы манёвров" ###Nidwt
TBK_cruiser_focus_desc: "В морской войне особенно важно знать, кто и что делает, поскольку ставки в море очень высоки. Несколько занятий для наших начинающих моряков должны помочь им координировать свои действия, чтобы они могли лучше ориентироваться и защищать друг друга."

TBK_submarine_focus: "Под волнами" ###Nidwt
TBK_submarine_focus_desc: "Стрелять в противника издалека предпочтительнее. Стрелять в них, пока они нас не видят, ещё лучше. Если наши моряки смогут придерживаться обеих этих тактик, мы обязательно выйдем победителями из любой схватки!"

TBK_naval_academy: "Кадетский корпус" ###Nidwt
TBK_naval_academy_desc: "Мы заметили, что очень немногие из наших моряков действительно владеют знаниями, необходимыми для правильного управления судном. Нравится им это или нет, но им придется сесть и выучить несколько вещей, если они хотят бороздить морские просторы."

TBK_ship_dockyard_expansion: "Большие военно-морские верфи" ###Nidwt
TBK_ship_dockyard_expansion_desc: "Поскольку мы строим всё больше и больше кораблей, мы начали привлекать некоторых наших граждан, которые до недавнего времени не проявляли никакого интереса к морю. Если мы предоставим им место для работы и дадим несколько уроков, у нас появятся лучшие корабельные мастера в Зебрике, а может быть, и во всем мире."

TBK_battleship_designs: "Плавучая крепость" ###Nidwt
TBK_battleship_designs_desc: "По мере того, как мы продвигаемся к созданию нашего флота как грозной силы, всё более очевидной становится необходимость в больших кораблях, которые будут его возглавлять. Мы не ожидаем, что их будет много, но было бы оскорблением для нашего населения, если бы мы хотя бы не попытались."

TBK_destroyer_designs: "Проектирование малых судов" ###Nidwt
TBK_destroyer_designs_desc: "Эсминцы! Они составляют основную часть большинства военно-морских сил, и наши не станут исключением. Но для начала нам нужно создать достойный проект. Совсем недавно у нашего побережья потерпел крушение эсминец из Мэйргипта. Возможно, мы сможем его изучить."

TBK_submarine_designs: "Проектирование подводных лодок" ###Nidwt
TBK_submarine_designs_desc: "Подводные лодки! Бесшумные морские убийцы. Они печально известны тем, что могут нанести ущерб большим кораблям. Вполне логично, что мы должны инвестировать в них, учитывая, что у некоторых наших соседей военно-морские силы больше, чем у нас."

TBK_cruiser_design: "Развёртывание самолётов в открытом море" ###Nidwt
TBK_cruiser_design_desc: "Наземные аэропорты имеют своё применение, но что насчёт мобильных аэропортов, с которых мы можем совершать воздушные налёты практически в любом месте? Они могут быть невероятно полезны. Тот факт, что они могут быть хорошо бронированы, является огромным бонусом. Конечно, нам ещё необходимо их разработать."

TBK_navy_final: "Править волнами" ###Nidwt
TBK_navy_final_desc: "Тобук! Известный своими орудиями, но теперь он также известен своим... ещё только зарождающимся флотом! Мы прошли долгий путь за столь короткое время, но нам ещё многое предстоит узнать и открыть, чтобы стать настоящим игроком на море. По крайней мере, наши моряки могут идти в ногу со временем наряду с лучшими моряками со всего мира."

In exchange for a set sum of money and amnesty, Pea Shooter and his allies will organise Tobuck to be ready for annexation. The deadline for this is January 1st, 1008, though Pea Shooter assures he can settle everything before it. Though in mind, he knows he will do his best to squeeze last bits from the remaining arms.

Both sides allure him in different ways, one for its vanities and the other for the riches one could aquire. The car begins to slow and he hears the crowds in the distance, awaiting his speech. He quickly makes his choice, and pens the last line of his speech."

tobuck_vasile.6.d:0 "An event for Warzena about the recent referendum in Tobuck; while the results show that the population wish to remain part of the republic, there are not only rumours but clear showcases of illicit activitiesat the voting places. Despite this, the republic is adamant about following this supposed will of the people. Warzena is now left with a choice. Either it can accept the result and give up any claims it has on the state or declare it null which will lead to war without the aid of Hippogriffia."

tobuck_vasile.8.d:0 "A generic event where Tobuck formally approaches either Zarantia or Warzena seeking mutual defence pact, especially one against the Chiropterrans. While on paper being especially useful for Tobuck, the fact is that it is also beneficial to Zarantia/Tobuck as that same treaty would call Tobuck in aid.

Vasile has wisely distanced himself from the judicial trial since he himself is one such stooge. The judge is his choice. however, just to be sure. But as the trial concurs, the investigator at charge of the entire case asks the judge to pen a formal request to Equestria to imprison Pea Shooter. This causes a stir, since the judge knows this can open quite a can of beans. But the mood in the hall is too much, so the judge accepts the deal."

tobuck_wallnut.1.d:0 "Он должен избавиться от одного из них, и это самое сложное. Заводить друзей всегда весело, а избавляться от любого из них непросто, но это был выбор, который он обязан сделать.\n\nУоллнат, обычно не любивший папок и бумаг, сидел за новым столом, подняв копыта вверх; нахмурив брови, он рассматривал два досье, лежащие перед ним. Барагзен и Алесия, два изгнанника. Первый из другой страны, второй с другого континента. Конечно, они были монархистами и довольно традиционными, но он был открыт даже для самых разрозненных существ. Все они были военачальниками, по крайней мере, это их объединяло.\n\nКонечно, несмотря на все его размышления, трудное решение оставалось. Ему нужен был один друг и один враг, чтобы убедиться, что его правительство держит себя в копытах , работать с одним и нападать на другого. Зебра ценил хорошие вечеринки, а земная пони была остроумна и весела в общении; в разных отношениях все они ладили, как дом в огне.\n\nУоллнат вздохнул и отложил досье с нехарактерным для него недомоганием. Кого бы ему оставить рядом, чтобы натравить на другого?"
tobuck_wallnut.1.a:0 "Алесия сможет утешить его."

tobuck_wallnut.2.d:0 "Был ранний полдень в "Солёном бароне", популярном пабе на побережье Тобука, недалеко от границы с Хироптеррой. Нахождение в такой непосредственной близости от этих фанатиков часто приводило к интересным разговорам о том, что происходило за предупреждающими знаками, предварительно разбросанными вдоль побережья.\n\n— Я слышал, что они приносят зебр в жертву своим ночным богам! — Завопил один жеребец, размахивая пивом, чтобы придать ужаса своему утверждению.\n\n— О, да? А я слышала, что они вызывают монстров, чтобы похищать наших детей посреди ночи! — Крикнула ещё одна, вскакивая со стула.\n\nВскоре местные жители быстро впали в истерику и отдались своим страхам, погрязнув в рассказах обо всём ужасном, что происходит в Хироптерре, несмотря на все попытки бармена успокоить пони. Как раз в тот момент, когда хозяин заведения решил прибегнуть к крайним мерам, он заметил то, что заставило его сердце уйти в копыта: хорошо одетый фестрал в сопровождении небольшой свиты вооружённых пони вошёл в его паб. Отряд военачальника, без сомнения. На данный момент солдаты, казалось, лишь наблюдали за разворачивающимся хаосом.\n\nКто—то в толпе выкрикнул громче остальных — Да! Этому месту конец! Кто нас спасёт, когда в дверь постучатся мыши, чтобы поработить нас и наших сородичей?!\n\nФестрал ухмыльнулся, а затем харизматично ответил — Ну, я, конечно!\n\nБольшинство посетителей паба повернулись к вошедшему незнакомцу. Некоторые были озадачены, других охватило подозрение. А ты ещё кто такой? — спросил один из них.\n\nПозволь—ка мне рассказать кое—что тебе, — сказал фестрал, запрыгивая на один из столов, — Все эти истории, которые вы рассказывали о Хироптерре? Всё это правда. Всё, что вы сказали. И я знаю это, потому, что я, Уоллнат Драйв, вырвался из их лап много лет назад. А это значит, что только я смогу защитить вас от них.\n\nБыло ли это из—за алкоголя или очаровательной улыбки Уоллната, толпа, казалось, поверила его заверениям, к большому облегчению бармена."

tobuck_wallnut.3.d:0 "— Как вы можете видеть, генералиссимус, легионеры Хироптерры отступили в... э—э, сэр? Может, нам зайти к вам чуть позже?\n\nУоллнат стоял неподвижно, пока портной снимал с него мерки для новой униформы. — Чушь! Продолжайте, пожалуйста. Он ухмыльнулся. В последнее время Драйв слышал только хорошие новости о своих войсках, и поэтому решил обзавестись шикарным новым прикидом, чтобы отпраздновать свой неизбежный триумф. Его лейтенанты не могли не задаться вопросом, почему из всех возможных мест он решил сделать это в командном пункте.\n\nЛейтенанты, к которым он обращался коротко переглянулись, а затем один из них продолжил — Что ж, сэр, оставшиеся силы мышей бежали в сельскую местность. Их цепь командования рухнула, когда мы захватили их города, и по большей части освобождённые населённые пункты полностью целы. Однако большинство арсеналов и складов с оружием были разрушены до того, как мы смогли добраться до них, и...\n\n— Попридержи—ка эту мысль, — перебил пони Уоллнат. Он нахмурился, глядя на карту Хироптерры на центральном столе. Мгновение спустя его глаза заблестели, и он улыбнулся своим подчинённым.—Этот огромный отель в столице всё ещё цел? У него вроде ещё название было "Дримскейп".\n\n— Ну, наверное? Нью—Аякачтли был относительно нетронут. Но я не понимаю, как это —\n\n— Немедленно обезопасьте его.—генералиссимус в волнении хлопнул копытами, к большому неудовольствию своего портного, который всё ещё пытался снять мерки.\n\nЕсли раньше его помощники просто недоумевали, то теперь они были совершенно сбиты с толку.—При всём уважении, сэр... Зачем? \n\nУхмылка Уоллната становилась всё шире и шире по мере того, как его воображение рисовало всё более красочные картины—Несомненно, все победы должны быть отпразднованы. У меня тоже есть план на этот счёт..."

tobuck_wallnut.4.t:0 "Два старых мыслителя" ###Garion
tobuck_wallnut.4.d:0 "Празднование продолжалось до глубокой ночи, так что некоторым пожилым пони было трудно заснуть. Даск Уэйн был одним из таких. Его кости заныли, когда он встал с предоставленной ему роскошной кровати. Удивительно, но то, что он был одним из наименее известных говорящих с Луной в Хироптерре позволило ему получить приглашение остановиться во дворце Уоллната. Хотя он считал вопиющее пренебрежение отступника к учениям Найтмер еретическим, он не мог не чувствовать, что молодой жеребец был просто введён в заблуждение, и что военачальнику ещё не поздно изменить свой путь.\n\n — Тоже не можешь уснуть, 'товарищ'? Если тебя так, конечно, можно назвать?\n\nДаск потёр глаза. В холле сидел пожилой земной пони и курил сигарету. Уэйн вспомнил, что видел его несколько раз раньше. Какой—то старый неисправимый марксист из Мейргипета. Его вроде звали Нифтин, верно? — У этих молодых столько энергии, что я и не думал, что такое возможно. Мне просто нужно подышать свежим воздухом. Так что, если вы не возражаете, я пойду своей дорогой.\n\nНифтин покачал головой — Вам будет трудно найти тихое место в этом дворце, Даск. Я знаю Уоллната уже давно. В каждом уголке этого места будет кипеть жизнь, пока все они не рухнут от усталости.\n\n— Тогда почему бы тебе не присоединиться к ним, 'товарищ'? Этот зал и так мог бы быть немного менее оживлённым.\n\n— Я никогда не был сторонником торжеств, в которых не участвуют бедные и несчастные, — Нифтин затянулся сигаретой.—Здесь, в Тобуке, их всё ещё довольно много, далеко за пределами роскоши этого дворца.\n\n— Там далеко... — Даск чуть не повысил голос, но потом понял, что на самом деле согласен с утверждением другого жеребца. Он подошёл, чтобы прислониться к той же стене, что и Нифтин, и глубоко вздохнул—Да. Может быть, мы сможем согласиться с одним фактом. Даск взглянул на другого жеребца, который протягивал ещё одну сигарету, предлагая закурить ему. Уэйн усмехнулся и взял её. — Может быть, даже с двумя фактами."

Всё будет хорошо. Пара остановок по пути, и мы уйдём до захода солнца; с нами ничего не случится.\n\n— Это не... начал Бин, тут же переведя дух, прежде чем продолжить: — Ожидание с—сделает только... х—хуже... — Через мгновение ему удалось закончить свои мысли.\n\nУчитывая вполне реальный риск того, что за время ожидания их могут расстрелять как предателей, это было разумно. К счастью, их вряд ли узнают, если только сам Уоллнат не зайдёт в кафе, в котором они пытались расслабиться.\n\n— Не могу не согласиться, нет ничего хуже ожидания! — Громко прозвучал знакомый голос.\n\nО нет..\n\nБин выпрыгнул из своего пальто и прижался к стене, в то время как его друг просто уставился широко раскрытыми глазами на их неожиданного гостя. Он был прямо здесь, прямо перед ними. Неужели он зашёл сюда, чтобы купить что—нибудь на обратном пути во дворец? В данный момент казалось более вероятным, что Вселенная просто хотела им насолить.\n\n— Всё хорошо? Вы оба выглядите так, будто только что упали головой вперёд в Тартар! — добавил Генералиссимус, не обращая внимания на их полные ужаса лица. — Ну, я как раз искал вас двоих; у меня для всех нас намечается вечеринка в одном шикарном отеле. Увидимся там, а?\n\nИ вот он исчез так же быстро, как и появился. Два оставшихся и совершенно убитых пони смотрели друг на друга с осознанием."

То, что они не заставляли его сесть в машину, не означало, что это не какая—то ловушка, хотя он мог поверить и в то, что Уоллнат устраивает какую—то "вечеринку" за счёт достоинства фестрала.\n\nПрошло ещё несколько минут наблюдения за миром через тонированные окна, прежде чем они прибыли в отель, где их встретил сам пони.\n\n— Да это же сам Кэррот Стик! Как поживаешь с тех пор, как мы виделись в последний раз? — Радостно спросил военачальник, беззаботно рыская вокруг.\n\nКонечно, они никогда не встречались, поскольку Уоллнат был предателем и отступником, но они знали друг о друге много лет. К сожалению, государственный служащий очень не любил командира наёмников, несмотря на его необычайно реформистские взгляды на управление. Он просто ничего не сказал и вздохнул, слегка повесив голову.\n\n— Дайте мне знать, если вам что—нибудь понадобится до начала празднования. Я буду внутри, если что. — Предложил бунтарь с удивительным смирением, по крайней мере, сделав попытку к примирению.\n\nДругая машина, с таким же сопровождением, подъехала и разгрузилась, когда Генералиссимус небрежной рысью удалился. Роуз Рейн выглядел таким же встревоженным, как и Кэррот, поэтому они шли навстречу друг другу, медленно пробираясь внутрь отеля.\n\n— Он мог бы сделать для этого места так много, но первое, что он устраивает—вечеринка. — выдала кобыла, скорее разочарованная хозяином, нежели смущённая и раздражённая.\n\nОн не собирался ни с кем здесь разговаривать, но это замечание застало фестрала врасплох. — Вся эта сила и харизма растрачена на алкоголь и музыку.\n\n— Хироптеррская государственная служащая, согласная с гармонистом...

Вино также очень ценно, когда оно не вытекает из разбитых бутылок, и поэтому... Подожди, ты это слышал?\n\nИз—за нескольких больших бочек в задней части подвала послышался протяжный стон. Два товарища посмотрели друг на друга, затем медленно выглянули из—за бочек.

Пожалуйста —ик— скажи мне, что я могу сделать, чтобы помочь тебе почувствовать себя —ик— лучше...\n\nДаск и Нифтин снова посмотрели друг на друга.

tobuck_wallnut.11.d:0 "The family of five was huddled around the radio they’d managed to get for the kitchen, more morbidly curious than hopeful. The last time somepony had taken over Tobuck they’d turned it into a smuggler’s heaven, which didn’t exactly bode well for this new ‘Wallnut Drive’ fellow. The foals liked him at least, though grandmare was far from convinced.\n\nSoft Brie carefully tuned the radio to the address that had been slated for the evening before sauntering over to sit next to her husband. “What do you think he’ll do with this place?”\n\nThe stallion simply looked at her, then at his mother and grimaced as the frequency came to life.\n\n“...Now I know what’s on all your minds, what with the war and Pea’s fun little deal with the Zarantians. I know a lotta you would probably wanna go through with it too, returnin’ to the peaceful life under the tribes an’ all. But, I ask of all of you, would anythin’ change? Would you ‘ave any more freedom? Would you ‘ave any more of that representation?”\n\nDim Bulb glanced at his wife who looked back with confusion in her eyes, over to the old mare in the corner who scoffed and picked up the paper as Wallnut Drive’s speech continued. He had a point, this city really had never been truly free to do as its people desired.\n\n“My friends and I, though I should really call ‘em my advisors, ‘ave put together a few ideas. Carrot Stick, Rose Rain and myself are gonna be turnin’ this place into a real democracy; harmony an’ all. Oh an’ of course we want your help to make it the best...”\n\nThe couple tuned out most of the rest, though their foals were still enthralled by the charisma of the thestral on the air. Unsurprisingly their grandmare had already sauntered into the kitchen with a disapproving look on her face, assuming it was another scam; but Dim and Soft were quietly hopeful."

Neither Tobuck nor Chiropterra have any prior history of democracy or harmony; we need the president to remain powerful so that things remain stable whilst we set everything up, otherwise it will just fall apart by the time our work is done.” The thestral insisted, gesturing vaguely at Wallnut Drive every so often.\n\nThe mare sighed and shook her head before responding, “And I see what you’re getting at, but if we empower the president whilst reforming the country then what reason would the people have to engage in democracy? Why would they willingly vote for change in a regime that works and is already making the changes they want to see?”\n\nAs the two continued to bicker about what the right course of action was, Wallnut set down his newspaper with the half-finished crossword that had been provided by his secretary. He might not understand much about politics, but he knew how to resolve a hot debate between friends; even though his methods for such were typically rather primitive.\n\n“Both of you, shut it for just a mo.” He demanded in an unfamiliar bark, presumably the tone he took when commanding.\n\nThe pair nodded as he pulled up a chair and sat beside them.\n\n“Thank you. Now, I figure this might be a little hard to comprehend; but I’ll break it down for ya. What if you just do both? Give the president their powers and make ‘em accountable to the representatives or whatever. Power with scrutiny, right?” He offered, resting his chin on his hooves.\n\nFor a moment they sat in shock, glancing at one another both for the fact that Wallnut had actually involved himself in a political discussion and because his idea wasn’t that bad. In fact, they were both a little miffed that they hadn’t thought of it themselves."

Многие были шокированы, увидев, что гигантская фреска с изображением Найтмер Мун над главным входом была убрана и заменена гораздо более мрачным произведением искусства, изображающим полную луну в звёздном ночном небе. Даже название на здании было изменено; теперь там была вывеска 'Стил Мунворкс'.\n\Их прежний босс заверил их, что все изменения были внесены исключительно в соответствии с новыми законами, но у рабочих всё ещё оставались сомнения. Как могло новое правительство, которое разрушило всё, во что они верили, действовать в их наилучших интересах?\n\nКогда рабочие приблизились к главному входу, несколько хорошо одетых пони вышли из здания. Они представились рабочим, сказав, что они из Объединённого Трудового Фронта. Большая часть фестралов была сбита с толку и спрашивала, что это такое.\n\n— Профсоюз, призванный обеспечить благополучие каждого работника в Хироптерре! Одна из недавно реализованных программ Даска Уэйна!—объяснили им. Рабочие, казалось, не решались им поверить, но более приятные и безопасные условия труда действительно казались привлекательным новшеством. Многие ненадолго останавливались, чтобы расспросить подробнее, полагая, что обещания, которые им давали, казались слишком хорошими, чтобы быть правдой.\n\nНо когда они начали свой рабочий день, стало ясно, что сейчас условия труда были намного, намного лучше, чем раньше. Страх и беспокойство почти мгновенно рассеялись среди них. Один рабочий бросил последний взгляд на стену, на которой раньше было несколько граффити с изображением Найтмэр Мун. Она была почти полностью стёрта с лица земли; от старой веры остались лишь мелкие напоминания о её существовании."

Её местный храм был почти полностью разрушен, и когда пришло время его восстанавливать, она была шокирована тем, что новое правительство заявило будто Найтмэр Мун извращала их веру на протяжении веков, превратив эту религию в кошмар. Они сказали, что все храмы должны быть перестроены или реформированы, чтобы отразить "старую веру" в восходящую Луну, господствующую над ночным небом.\n\nТогда Понд испытывала противоречивые чувства из—за этого, но когда она задумалась обо всех тех ужасных вещах, которые её вера сделала с теми, кто отверг Найтмэр Мун, она поняла, что тоже стала предвзято относиться к неверующим.\n\nКогда она присоединилась к усилиям добровольцев по восстановлению храма, и Понд, и несколько её старых друзей были удивлены, увидев там друг друга. Фестрал воскликнула, что она решила спасти веру от её злодеяний и помочь вернуть лунный свет всем, кто в нём нуждался.\n\nОна была выдернута из своих мыслей, когда прозвенел звонок, означавший, что рабочие—реконструкторы, многие из которых даже не разделяли её религию, вот—вот прибудут на обед.

Их гордость была так высока, что они не видели, насколько испорченной становилась их вера на протяжении многих поколений.

Продвижения фестрала к тому, чтобы профсоюзы стали более широкой частью общества и политики наконец сработали. Новые объединения рабочих появлялись каждый день, и лишь немногие из них были безуспешными; на самом деле казалось, что границы между классами постепенно разрушаются, поскольку всё больше и больше уникальных организаций появлялись вокруг тем, интересовавших все слои граждан.\n\nТолько за сегодня он рассмотрел предложение от СИИ—Союза Изобразительных Искусств—который просил собрать и представить в новом музее исторические экспонаты со всей федерации. Старый пони улыбнулся и вздохнул, решив принять его, когда в следующий раз будет в своем кабинете. В конце концов, даже социалистический прогресс всегда строился на фундаменте истории, какой бы она ни была. Если профсоюз желает сохранить артефакты старины, он может удовлетворить эту просьбу.\n\nЕсли бы у него была возможность, Нифтин, вероятно, закрыл бы СИИ, как и многие другие профсоюзы, которые он считал "бесполезными"; возможно, все они рано или поздно исчезнут. Было действительно жаль, что они не согласны со многими тонкостями социализма; возможно, когда всё будет сказано и сделано, они смогут посидеть и поболтать о том, почему он так любит Стил Сталлиона, на что он, скорее всего, ответит вопросом, почему Даск так любит религию."

Лица, которых он никогда раньше не видел, пони, с которыми он никогда не разговаривал; как он должен был вынести вердикт о том, что они обсуждали? Хотя, с этого, пожалуй, надо и начать.\n\nФестрал дождался особенного момента когда все стали кричать друг на друга, прежде чем сделать ход,—Эй, эй, а ну заткнитесь на секунду, окей? Давайте так—это всё из—за какого—то дурацкого контракта на добычу полезных ископаемых, да? Скажите мне, чего вы хотите одним предложением, и я сделаю выбор.\n\nОбе фракции посмотрели на генералиссимуса с ужасным разочарованием в глазах, но выполнили его просьбу.

Это было действительно нечто, и это было намного дешевле, чем любое жильё в новой стране, где всё, что они будут делать,—это больше работать на ферме.\n\nСкарлет Пенни, его жена, подала голос с другого конца комнаты, уткнувшись в школьные брошюры.—Я изучала местные школы и...

Какова конечная цель федерации? Куда ведет нас наше великое государство, кроме как к победе и прогрессу?

Это должно было стать объявлением, и притом очень хорошим.

Какие это были кошмарные несколько месяцев, когда они пытались организовать то, что осталось от местных и центральных органов управления, и заставить этих идиотов снова работать вместе.\n\nВ конце концов, беспорядок был довольно нейтральным, по крайней мере, для его имиджа; первые дни "Алой войны" поставили под сомнение его лидерство, но со временем, когда рабочие увидели его и начали помогать правительству, большая часть ущерба была устранена. Доверия к самому правительству практически не осталось, но, по крайней мере, ему не нужно было беспокоиться о своём собственном положении. Чем меньше будет сказано о Даск Уэйне и Нифтине, тем лучше.\n\nЕго помощница, одна из немногих, работавших с правительством, которая, казалось, была предана ему в первую очередь, а не враждующим фракциям, просунула голову в дверь.\n\n— Сэр, у вас есть минутка?—спросила кобыла низким голосом.\n\nОн уставился на неё, налив стакан виски.—Конечно, если это не касается работы; на сегодня я с этим завязал.\n\nОна улыбнулась и неторопливо вошла,—Нет, в этот раз. Я... Мне тоже нужен перерыв. Вы знаете, всё это так... Для меня это слишком. Я не могу себе представить, каково это для вас.\n\nОн налил второй бокал и, несмотря на свой темперамент, выдавил из себя улыбку.

Проблемы с вашей религией, наши разногласия, казалось бы, по всем вопросам, от экономики до социальной политики; я просто думал, что к настоящему времени всё должно было развалиться. Каким—то образом... этого не произошло. Тебя это не удивляет?—спросил он, наклоняясь и гася сигарету в стеклянной пепельнице на столе.\n\nФестрал отложил газету и на мгновение задумался. В некоторых отношениях было впечатляюще, что их фракции в правительстве, казалось бы, сохранили полный паритет; на самом деле, в этом отношении это было очень похоже на двухпартийную демократию. Федерация всё ещё была социалистической и, конечно, гораздо более прогрессивной, чем прошлая республика, но сравнение, безусловно, можно было провести.\n\nОн улыбнулся и медленно кивнул,—Да, немного. Но мы сделали несколько замечательных вещей, не так ли? Я думаю, будет справедливо сказать, что нам лучше так и продолжить.\n\n— Пожалуй, ты прав.—неохотно признал Нифтин,—Это просто не совсем то, что я задумывал десять лет назад.\n\nДаск не мог не рассмеяться над этим,—Такова цена компромисса, товарищ. Лучше это, чем причинять друг другу головную боль, не так ли?\n\n— Хорошая идея. Я не знаю, что бы делал без тебя.—Земной пони выдохся, его ухмылка была прервана только ещё двумя кашлями."

tobuck_wallnut.86.d:0 "Для администрации стало невероятным сюрпризом, что Гиппогрифия, некогда прочно укоренившаяся монархия, мирно превратилась в коммунистическое государство, которое быстро нормализовало отношения с соседними социалистическими режимами. К сожалению для [HIP.GetLeader]—лидера этой страны—федерация, тем не менее, имела претензии на все части Хазрумении, включая районы, которые в настоящее время контролируются [HIP.GetName].\n\nРезультат того, что должно было произойти, был очевиден, но способ достижения полной интеграции региона в федерацию был менее ясен. Некоторые хотели войны, чтобы свергнуть лжекоммунистов, некоторые предлагали жёсткую и чёткую угрозу врагам федерального суверенитета, в то время как другие были непреклонны в том, что дипломатическое решение всё ещё доступно. У политиков и простых граждан были свои собственные идеи, но, в конце концов, задача исполнительной власти заключалась в том, чтобы решить, какой подход использовать с этими новыми политиками; в конце концов, всё зависело от Уоллната. Были ли они друзьями или врагами?\n\nЕго секретарша нервно заёрзала на своем месте, задав вопрос, на который все хотели знать ответ.—Извините Генералиссимус, делать такой выбор доложно быть сложно.\n\nОн улыбнулся и приложил копыто к подбородку, понимая, что это решение может решить судьбу федерации и всего севера континента. В его кабинете воцарилась неловкая тишина, пока она сидела с блокнотом в копыте, чтобы записать всё, что скажет фестрал."

Драйв молод и безрассуден—революционер, ставший таковым из—за прихотей окружающих его идеологий. К тому же его сложно поймать или прикончить.

tobuck_baragzen.2.d:0 "Барагзен во время своей утренней рутины точно не ожидал, что небольшая группа жеребцов, состоящих из одних пони, попытается добиться аудиенции у него в его собственном доме. Они неторопливо шли по просёлочной дороге, пока зебра с хмурым видом грызла особенно дорогой цветок, желая только одного—прогнать их прочь.\n\nИ всё же, опасаясь за свою репутацию и святость своего поместья, лорд подошёл к своей двери, пока они приближались к его дому. Излишне говорить, что его незваные гости были весьма удивлены, увидев, что он открыл им как раз в тот момент, когда они собирались постучать.\n\nПоловина из них поклонилась, а другая инстинктивно отдала честь, в то время как одна пони подошла, чтобы заговорить с ним—Приношу извинения за раннее беспокойство, сэр—Спринг Брииз к вашим услугам. У вас найдётся минута для нас?\n\n— Я слушаю.—Он просто хмыкнул, делая глоток какого—то напитка, который они не смогли рассмотреть.\n\nЕдинственный единорог в группе вышел вперёд и разгрузил свою седельную сумку, достав из неё небольшую стопку документов. Барагзен приподнял бровь, услышав это, но быстро всё понял, как только увидел знакомую печать вербовочного бюро королевской гвардии. Всем им было отказано в приёме в подразделения стражей клятвы просто потому, что они были пони, а не зебрами—единственной расой, которой в настоящее время разрешалось занимать такую престижную должность. В конце концов, в легендах никогда ничего не упоминалось о пони.\n\nСпринг начала подробно объяснять их проблему, но зебра подняла своё копыто показывая, что в этом не было необходимости. Он всё прекрасно понял.\n\nЕсли бы он допустил пони в свои ряды, это было бы оскорблением тех самых мифов, что породили королевскую гвардию. Но в то же время эти ограничения, безусловно, были непрактичными, так как большинство населения Тобука—пони. После того, как он дал очень неопределённое, но убедительное обещание группе и вернулся внутрь, Барагзен провёл большую часть дня, размышляя о будущем своей самой ценной части армии."

Это не был его обычный способ провести вторую половину рабочего дня, но обстоятельства вынудили его отменить пару пунктов из его дневного расписания. Ему был просто необходим короткий перерыв. Буквально два часа назад его секретарь сообщил ему о предложении Барагзена, в котором даже не было классической угрозы арестовать грифона за деловую халатность.\n\nРезультатом этого предложения стало его назначение на должность мэра Тобука. Ну, такого названия эта работа конечно пока не имела, но слово ‘мэр’ идеально отображало его новые обязанности и полномочия по управлению экономикой.\n\nУчитывая, что происходило—особенно сильно его настораживали региональные политические проблемы—Василе всерьёз задумывался исчезнуть отсюда, что всё ещё было возможно. Просто потому, что он принял пост премьер—министра в регионе с намерением заработать как можно больше денег вместе со своими партнёрами, не обязательно означало, что у него не было других вариантов. Если бы Хироптерра или Зарантия начали стучаться, у него всё ещё была бы стратегия отступления; но подыгрывать было бы разумно, по крайне мере сейчас.\n\nВ целом, выходило, что это этот парень Барагзен был очень полезной зеброй,особенно потому, что он судя по всему не знал о разных экономических злоупотреблениях Василе. Во всяком случае всё это может в конечном итоге оказаться одним из самых прибыльных начинаний в его карьере за всё время, особенно если лорд—изгнанник продолжит перекладывать экономические заботы на его подчинённых без особого надзора.\n\nОн должен был организовать для себя и своего нового работодателя какую—нибудь вечеринку, на которую он мог бы пригласить гостей. В конце концов, даже самым худшим существам в мире нужно время от времени надевать маску с приятным выражением лица, если они хотят чего—то добиться."

tobuck_baragzen.4.d:0 "По сути, это было своего рода маленькое чаепитие; не слишком отличающееся от того, что маленькая зебра обычно устраивает в кукольном домике, если её семья достаточно богата, чтобы купить такой. На самом деле, одомашненного леопарда, который сейчас лениво бездельничает у копыт Барагзена, было бы проще объяснить тем, что всё это происходит в воображение жеребёнка.\n\nЕго объяснение было простым, хотя решение в целом, тем не менее, было странным.—...и, конечно же, какой питомец может быть лучше, чем то, которое носит то же название, что и у фамилии моей семьи? Разве она не всегда такая милая...—Он рассмеялся, наполовину в шутку, наполовину всерьёз.\n\nЛорд взял со стола кусок вяленой рыбы и скормил его удивительно послушному зверю, в то время как его гости смотрели на это со смесью благоговения и замешательства. До сих пор лорд не проявлял особой способности к эксцентричности или потаканию своим желаниям, а в таком поступке было немного и того, и другого.\n\nЯрикх и несколько других зебр всё же относились к животному весьма доброжелательно, время от времени подкладывая ей несколько кусочков еды, когда они шли наполнять свои тарелки за столом различными угощениями обычными для званых обедов. Конечно, Барагзен и сам позаботился о том, чтобы у него было вдоволь еды; он был вполне доволен тем, что сидел, ел и разговаривал со своей довольно большой компанией гостей.\n\nДействительно, это было довольно приятное занятие, когда лорд получал множество похвал за свои подвиги, которые он милостиво принимал. Все присутствующие относились к нему с величайшим уважением—почти как если бы он уже был членом королевской семьи,—и ему это очень нравилось.\n\nВ какой—то момент особенно непринуждённо он даже пошутил—Слишком много этих вечеринок, и я могу потеряться в них!"

Всего несколько минут назад ему сообщили, что первая страница их таблоида будет ужасно неверной; что привело к тому, что он вскочил с постели и помчался в офисы вместе с некоторыми из его сотрудников, которые проснулись, когда он пытался открыть их двери. Пони, которого он назначил для репортажа о конфликте, до сих пор проделывал такую отличную работу, что ни один из них не ожидал, что солдаты просто отступят и вернутся домой после такой тяжёлой войны.\n\nЕму пришлось бы позвонить операторам печатного станка, и заставить их, по крайней мере, немедленно остановиться, но тогда чем бы он заменил страницы?\n\nВ комнату ворвалась ещё одна его сотрудница, сжимая карандаш с почти безумным выражением в усталых глазах.—У меня есть то, что нам нужно, сэр! У нас есть что поместить на обложку!—выпалила она, бросаясь к его столу и выкладывая какие—то нацарапанные планы.\n\n— Хвала богам,—Он вернулся, вздыхая с облегчением и потирая подаренные ему простыни.—Что ты принесла для меня?\n\nБлант Лид поняла, что он скорее всего не сможет прочитать и половины материала, и начала объяснять,—Мы попытались сосредоточить внимание читателей на том, как наши войска возвращают огромные богатства в Тобук, вместо того, чтобы тратить слишком много времени на описание самого договора. И вы знаете, что они сделают, если мы опишем его слишком негативным.\n\n— Хорошо, хорошо. Это просто прекрасно. Я отправлю это в печать.—Жеребец собрался уходить, запихивая документы в портфель, который он вскоре отправит на их склады.\n\n— Подождите, подождите! Мы не определились с заголовком; вот, выберите между этими двумя по дороге!\n\nОна лихорадочно нацарапала записку, которую он сжал зубами, после чего галопом выбежал из своего кабинета, получив возможность рассмотреть варианты только после того, как спустился на три лестничных пролёта."

А теперь он обладает мощью армии наёмников, превратившейся в профессиональную силу, и медленно централизует власть при поддержку других видных изгнанников в Тобуке. Ходят слухи, что он уже установил контакт с консервативными элементами в нашем правительстве. В то же время общественное восприятие постепенно перешло от пассивного веселья над сумасшедшим в газетах к осознанию реальности вероятности его возвращения.\n\nЕщё больше беспокойства вызывает то, что он претендует на трон Варзены как глава древней династии Леопардов, что делает цели его неизбежных завоеваний в будущем слишком очевидными. Некоторые представители администрации, немного воодушевлённые его недавним успехом, начали тихо обсуждать обоснованность этого самого заявления."

У Ярикха, Танис и Джетзабела не было особых причин не доверять друг другу, но, какими бы разными они ни были, у них было мало причин относится дружелюбно друг к другу. Это было его частью предложенной сделки, объединяющей всё, что осталось от дворянства, которое могло противостоять слабому королю. Пока он остаётся спокойным и собранным, они, без сомнения, будут сотрудничать; по крайней мере, в обозримом будущем.\n\nГруппа вышла с территории и попала в небольшую зону отдыха с полукруглой скамейкой, на которую каждая зебра уселась, чтобы хозяин мог выступить.—Итак, теперь мне нет необходимости повторять условия нашего соглашения; действительно, само ваше присутствие здесь указывает на то, что вы, пусть и предварительно, уже приняли его. Тем не менее, поскольку в настоящее время я скорее простой джентльмен, нежели король, я счёл нужным пригласить вас к себе домой, чтобы обсудить дела в более интимной обстановке.\n\nЭто явно несколько успокоило группу, которая была рада услышать, что он был серьёзным и отнюдь не дураком, несмотря на его отчуждённое поведение.\n\nЯрикх заговорил первым—такой же изгнанник, он, без сомнения, стремился вернуть то, что он потерял.—До тех пор, пока мои старые владения будут возвращены и безопасность моей семьи и положения могут быть обеспечены... Что ж, эта сделка более чем приемлема.\n\n— С дополнением в виде сохранения наших текущих претензий на землю и собственность, конечно же.—быстро добавил Джетзабел, стремясь получить как можно больше, насколько это было возможно в данных обстоятельствах.\n\nБарагзен повернулся и посмотрел на Танис, которая, казалось, была глубоко погружена в свои мысли. Вероятно, она рассматривала свою потенциальную роль в возрождении их традиционной веры, проект, к осуществлению которого она стремилась в течение многих лет.\n\n— Я приношу извинения за свои медленные размышления, но это потенциально очень опасное решение.—объяснила она, получив понимающий кивок от Барагзена и заставив двух других гостей переглянуться.—Я, однако, крайне заинтересована в сотрудничестве; возможно, я не должна беспокоиться.\n\nИх хозяин улыбнулся и хлопнул копытами в едва скрываемом ликовании,"

tobuck_baragzen.8.d:0 "Грифон в Тобуке был редким зрелищем, но этого начинал узнавать каждый пони в этом шумном городе. Харизма Василе и его причастность к различным проектам в городе привлекли к нему много внимания, и именно по этой причине Барагзен решил в этот раз нанести ему личный визит, а не отправлять коммюнике.\n\nСпокойно сидя на заднем сидение своего личного лимузина, зебра повернулась, чтобы заговорить. —Что ж, я могу только сказать, что мой выбор администратора не мог быть лучше. До сих пор ты проделывал отличную работу, мой друг. На самом деле я даже хочу вознаградить тебя за твою прекрасную службу.—предложил он с нехарактерно искренней улыбкой.\n\nВ ответ на это Василе вежливо покачал головой,—Это очень любезно с вашей стороны, мой сеньор, но моя служба под началом истинного короля Варзены—это уже подарок сам по себе.\n\nВозможно, это была самая величайшая ложь, которую грифон когда—либо говорил, поскольку он уже обдумывал, сколько мог бы заработать, расширяя свою политику спекуляции. Тобук процветал так хорошо, как никогда раньше, и он следил за тем, чтобы вместе с этим получать прибыль; инсайдерская торговля, тщательная организация налоговых льгот в растущих отраслях, в которых у него были контрольные доли, и ещё множество политик, которые большинство сочло бы 'коррумпированными', проводимых по всей стране... Возможности были поистине огромны, но не было бы ничего хорошего в том, чтобы показаться Барагзену амбициозным.\n\nЕго смирение возымело желаемый эффект, и зебра надменно рассмеялась, совершенно не подозревая, как много ускользает в когти его собственного подчинённого.—Конечно, ты шутишь! Я не смог найти никого более достойного повышения, только тебя!\n\nГрифон просто усмехнулся и поднял лапы в насмешливом неохотном согласии, поскольку у лорда, по—видимому, появилась искра идеи,"

Вдобавок ко всему само восстание, казалось, находилось в состоянии хаоса, процветая ещё больше из—за того, что король принял за вторжение.\n\nСудя по всему Барагзен был очень умным жеребцом, обеспечивающим, что любой конфликт, вспыхнувший между ним и Варзеной, будет рассматриваться не как война, а скорее как внутренняя междоусобица, которая распространилась на границы Тобука благодаря логистической, военной и национальной неразберихе. Даже вооружённые силы, казалось, не совсем были уверены в том, с кем они должны были сражаться. А какие генералы были связаны с истеблишментом, не знала ни одна зебра.\n\nИзлишне говорить, что это породило состояние полного беспорядка, и наши союзники, по—видимому, не желают действовать, опасаясь, что они могут выступить не на той стороне или что они могут спровоцировать дальнейший конфликт между враждующей знатью. Установление контакта с нашими союзниками и обеспечение стабильной цепочки командования займёт много времени; всё, что мы можем сделать, это надеяться, что у остатков армии останется достаточно верности, и они смогут продержаться до прибытия помощи."

Чего никто не ожидал, так это глубины нестабильности, которую вызовет потенциальное вторжение—если его вообще можно было так назвать.\n\nВ то время как изгнанник действительно 'объявил войну' Варзене, провозгласив себя её законным правителем, то, что последовало в последние дни, учитывая ещё и то, что мы получили по сообщениям, больше похоже на чрезвычайно беспорядочную гражданскую войну. Сначала вмешательство в их дела казалось самым простым и правильным курсом действий, как это было бы при оказании помощи союзнику во время конфликта, но реальность сложилась совершенно не так, как мы ожидали.\n\nОтчасти благодаря тому, что наши линии связи были перерезаны, и общему хаосу, который, по—видимому, является нормой для всех аспектов государства Варзены, вторжение стало рискованным предложением. Мы можем только надеяться, что правительство продержится достаточно долго, чтобы восстановить контакт."

В прошлом амнистия предоставлялась время от времени и редко, как правило, в соответствии с личными пристрастиями каждого правящего монарха. В этом смысле это решение ничем не отличалось бы, но в других оно, безусловно, было отклонением от нормы.\n\nВ отличие от слабого короля, у которого не хватило духу победить Барагзена и который соответственно пострадал от последствий, истинный наследник трона не допустит таких ошибок. Вся правящая оппозиция будет казнена, и это решение будет выполнено немедленно. Даже его копыто немного дрожало, когда он подписывал их смертные приговоры; никогда не было просто приказать убить другого, когда он был беззащитен, но в конечном счёте это было необходимо.\n\nКогда дело дошло до солдат и генералов, которые не принимали особого участия в боевых действиях, а также тех, кто дезертировал, то лорд был добр к ним. Солдаты сражаются, потому что это их работа, и их лояльность была необходима для того, чтобы обеспечить его власть. Кроме того, государственные служащие и другие простые создания были избавлены от гнева мстительного изгнанника; он нуждался в их одобрении так же сильно, как прошлый узурпатор нуждался в их согласии, а потому попросту не было необходимости наказывать их.\n\nВ столице Варзены зебры медленно возвращались к своей обычной жизни, ожидая прибытия Барагзена и его неизбежной коронации. Дворяне, которые встали на его сторону, уже готовились к этому событию, а также приводили в порядок улицы, принимая надлежащие меры для возвращения давно отвергнутой династии.

Новый правитель Варзены осторожно поднялся по красивой резной лестнице на балкон, с которого он должен был обратиться к своим верноподданным. Для того, чтобы огромные толпы простозебр и солдат, собравшихся, чтобы поприветствовать его, могли услышать его, было установлено множество микрофонов и динамиков.

Их ждал настоящий сюрприз.\n\nПодождав, пока утихнут аплодисменты, даже поощряя своих хозяев остановиться жестами копыта и тёплой улыбкой, Барагзен начал говорить.—Мои верноподданные, для меня и династии Леопардов большая честь наконец вернуться в это великое государство. Слишком долго вы томились под властью слабого монарха, который принёс вам и остальной части нашей некогда процветающей нации не что иное, как ужасный застой и полное подчинение иностранным державам.

Если мы хотим выжить и возродить наше давно утраченное наследие, мы должны начать конкуренцию с нашими врагами! Мы должны бороться, и мы должны победить!

Этому Алесия научилась в Северяне, когда за годы до революции дворяне настроили против себя всю возможную поддержку своего правления.\n\nЗная это, она должна была сделать важный выбор. В Тобуке оставались два военачальника и ей нужна была поддержка одного из них, чтобы гарантировать победу над другим. Одним из них был Барагзен, изгнанный дворянин с капризной репутацией. Другим был Уоллнат, радикал который известен своим мастерством и ревностной приверженностью революционным идеалам.\n\nНи тот, ни другой не были идеальными кандидатами, но она быстро пришла к выводу, что..."

Алесия только что получила огромную сумму денег от особенно богатого изгнанника, который, несмотря на свою своеобразную репутацию, был, очевидно, в восторге от её успехов.\n\nЕё помощник, некто Энтин Мирон, стоял рядом с ней, наблюдая, как корабль доброго дарителя разгружается в порту. — Командующий, я считаю, что мы должны использовать эти деньги для модернизации наших оружейных запасов; давно пора отправить на склады наше старое вооружение.\n\n— Без мощностей, необходимых для массового производства, у нас может оказаться слишком мало оружия в целом; хотя вы правы, говоря, что наши нынешние запасы тревожно устарели. Она ответила, хотя и оценила его проницательность.\n\nКоличество или качество, промышленное мастерство или усовершенствованное оборудование. Сложный выбор, но она быстро решила, что..."

tobuck_alesia.3.d:0 "Another small stack of paper, another list of potential candidates. Alesia had almost lost hope for the various lineages of Severyana by now, having spent years looking over the most distant of cousins and the most absurd family trees. Nevertheless, new claimants were found every now and then; though few held any interest in the position of Tsar.\n\nA profile of five new ponies had been compiled for her, but none of them were particularly impressive. A drunk, a lunatic, somepony that was old enough to die before she could possibly hope to reclaim the homeland and another two that were at least relatively promising. Even so, they were far from perfect; one was hardly active with the exiled community and another didn't even live in Equus anymore.\n\nAlesia sighed and rubbed her forehead with her right hoof, staring at the papers for a moment before standing up and trotting over to one of many filing cabinets in her office."

tobuck_alesia.4.d:0 "Strolling the gardens of the presidential palace at night, Alesia thought back to what she'd seen earlier that day. Ponies and zebras gathered together outside for a ceremony honouring one of their gods, singing hymns together under the scorching Zebrican sun. These creatures had nothing: although Alesia's governance had rooted out much of the corruption and decadence of the criminal—elite, she was under no illusions. These creatures, her creatures, had no security, they had no heritage, they were surrounded by enemies, and most of them owned little more than the clothes on their backs. And yet they had their faith.\n\nPerhaps that was why the red devils hated religion so, she thought, gazing up at the moon. They could take home, family, property and nation away from honest creatures, but in order to truly break them they had to also take their gods. Alesia had never been a particularly religious mare, but she swore then and there that she would not run a secular state. Tobuck would be united in faith, just as soon as she had consolidated her rule enough to make it so.\n"And what shall I swear this to?" she mused aloud, remembering the moonlit rituals her family used to perform, so long ago."

tobuck_alesia.5.d:0 "Отчеты были мрачными. Финансовые и материальные затраты на войну против Хироперры были высоки, но оккупация становилась всё дороже и дороже. Рейды, террористические атаки и всевозможные нападки сопротивления были безудержны; но если мы отступим с территории, то их режим фанатиков просто вернётся под новым руководством, которое также пожелает уничтожить Тобук. Что им оставалось делать, кроме как остаться?\n\n— Добрый вечер, мэм, — раздался незнакомый голос сзади.\n\nАлесия остановилась и начала. Она знала всех своих слуг лично; кто бы это ни был, это незваный гость, который проскользнул мимо её охраны. Инстинктивно она выхватила пистолет и развернулась, направив оружие прямо в лоб нарушителю.\n\nБез колебаний она потребовала объяснений: — Кто вы и почему не воспользовались возможностью убить меня, пока я стояла спиной?\n\n— Потому что я, верный слуга хироперрских говорящих с Луной, не получал приказа лишить вас жизни. Мне было поручено доставить вам это, и ничего больше. Зебра в капюшоне ответил, не поднимая глаз.\n\nОн медленно опустил копыто в один из карманов своей мантии и достал небольшой свиток, который положил на стол. Алесия подошла вперёд и взяла его, не сводя взгляда с незваного гостя.\n\nПовернувшись к ещё открытой двери, она позвала: — Стража! Уведите этого жеребца!\n\nЗебра медленно кивнул, затем сел на пол и начал молиться на непонятном языке. Поняв, что он не представляет угрозы, Алесия убрав оружие в кобуру прочитала записку, когда какофония копыт стражи загрохотала по коридору к её покоям.\n\nЭто было приглашение."

tobuck_alesia.6.d:0 "Энтин шагал взад—вперёд, его сапоги стучали по камням во дворе заброшенного дома. Он был уверен, это ловушка, что было вполне разумным предположением. С другой стороны, его командир считал, что это будет предвестником какого—то перемирия или условной капитуляции. Если бы хирроптеррские говорящие с Луной хотели её смерти, они бы уже убили её.\n\nМножество шагов привлекло их внимание. Как и было обещано, к ним приближалась группа говорящих с Луной, возглавляемая одним из них, шедшим чуть впереди остальных. Алесия подождала, пока один из них заговорит.\n\n— Алесия Снежная, я полагаю?\n\nОна кивнула,—а вы кто?\n\nФигура шагнула в поле зрения и улыбнулась,—Лунар Хэйл; я представительница всех говорящих с Луной в Хироптерре. В ответ она остановилась и глубоко поклонилась военачальнику.\n\n\nВместе с ней остальные тоже поклонились, следуя примеру своего лидера. Они оба знали о ней, одной из самых ревностной и известной защитнице своей веры. Почему она здесь, и, что более важно, почему они кланяются?\n\nАлесия улыбнулась, в основном от удивления. Понятно.—Разве я не ваш враг, из—за последних событий?\n\n—Напротив, вы заслуживаете глубочайшего уважения за свои достижения. Только достойный с благословения Луны мог победить легионы Её Императорского Величества и...\n\n— Я ценю эти добрые слова, но чем дольше это будет продолжаться, тем больше моих солдат погибнет, сражаясь с вашими. Какой смысл во всем этом? Сердечно спросила пони.\n\nНа мгновение Лунар стала недовольной, но потом вспомнила, что её легион тоже страдает.—Конечно. Если говорить прямо, мы хотим, чтобы ты правила Хироптеррой; Луна благословила тебя дарами, а нас—тобой, и мы не упустим эту возможность."
tobuck_alesia.6.a:0 "Энтин и Алесия уставились друг на друга, явно ошарашенные."

tobuck_alesia.7.t:0 "Кому мы присягаем"
tobuck_alesia.7.d:0 "Некоторое время стояла тишина. Условия сотрудничества были изложены, в основном говорящими с Луной, опасающимися, что одна из сторон вызовет недовольство другой. Глаза Алесии медленно сканировали лица командиров легионов, но понять их было трудно. В этом отношении они были очень похожи на неё.\n\nЭмеральд Лайт заговорил первым, взглянув на Лунар Хэйл, прежде чем переключить свое внимание на нового правителя.—Это единственное разумное решение. Я делаю то, что велит вера.\n\nОна поклонилась и отступила назад, чтобы остальные могли высказать свое мнение.\n\n— Пока мы сохраняем наш статус и наши легионы, я не возражаю против этого соглашения. Найтмер приказывает этого, я следую за её приказом. Аутум Бриз согласилась, выражая тем самым уважение.\n\nЛайтинг Чарм нахмурилась, но все же кивнула.—Я недовольна, прежде всего, действиями наших военных. Я буду сотрудничать при условии, что мне позволят реформировать легионы так, чтобы они никогда больше не несли таких потерь.\n\nАлесия согласилась с этой просьбой, так как это пойдет только на пользу их объединенным вооруженным силам. Затем она посмотрела на две оставшиеся фигуры, которые выглядели несколько неоднозначно. Стоун Палисад просто пожал плечами и поклонился, понимая, что это путь вперёд, и рассматривая свою потерю как свидетельство необходимости перемен. Этернал Эклипс был явно недоволен, но всё же он заговорил.\n\n— Я согласен с предложением, при условии, что мне будет позволено уйти в отставку, а мой пост будет передан моему внуку Люсенту. Я уже слишком стар, чтобы реформировать Хироптерру в таких масштабах, как сейчас, но он будет вам очень полезен.\n\nАлесия согласилась:—Это можно организовать."

Эта земля принадлежит мне как вашей Царице и Найтмер как вашей Богине в равной степени. Алесия закончила свою речь и вздохнула, понимая, что этот сценарий ей ещё понадобится во время выступления.\n\nЗнакомый звук Энтина предупредил её о его присутствии возле двери в кабинет. Он всё ещё был в форме даже в час ночи, впрочем, как и она. У них обоих был очень длинный день.\n\nОн ухмыльнулся:—Неплохо. Ты точно знаешь, что сказать этим фанатикам.\n\n— Мы можем не заниматься этим прямо сейчас? Нет. Мы не можем бросить это всё прямо сейчас, особенно после того, как ты бросил меня в первый раз. Что ты делаешь в Тартаре, сотрудничая с этими маньяками? Ты сказала мне, что твои родители так и не смогли до тебя достучаться! Он надавил на неё, нахмурив брови в попытке завести вопрос дальше.\n\nАлесия отложила газету, которую читала, и опустила голову на деревянный сундук, с гримасой смотря на своего давнего друга краем глаза.\n\n— Они не входили, во всяком случае, не так. Я никогда не принимала их веру по ряду причин, но и не отвергала её. Сейчас я просто хочу, чтобы насилие прекратилось. Нам нужно, чтобы оно прекратилось. Она ответила медленно, подняв голову и сделав несколько длинных вдохов.\n\nОн стоял молча, прежде чем кивнуть.—Обещай мне, что будешь осторожна со всеми этими штучками Найтмер. Я просто беспокоюсь о том, к чему это может привести, вот и всё."

Она провела так много времени в Зебрике, сражаясь за деньги, за Северяну и за мечту, которая всегда казалась такой далекой. Теперь она была здесь, а лидерство было возложено на неё так, как она никогда не могла ожидать.\n\nМедали, которые она носила на своем королевском одеянии, были многочисленными и тяжелыми. Некоторые из них были получены во время службы в Королевской Гвардии, некоторые—во время сражений за различные фракции Зебрики, а некоторые были дарованы Хиропетеррцами. Это было чуждое ощущение—быть в таком наряде сейчас, так далеко от дома. Но теперь здесь был дом. Новая Северяна станет её царством и наследием, её страной и народом, который она сможет выстроить по своему усмотрению. Командовать армией теперь значило командовать государством и обществом, которое может стать великим, но в то же время никогда не будет таким, каким она мечтала его видеть.\n\nНесмотря на всё это, она чувствовала гордость: в каком—то смысле она достигла того, ради чего прибыла в Зебрику. Оставалось только закончить то, что она начала."

Возможно, они сохранили его в первозданном виде из ностальгии, как она сохранила свою форму, хотя как кто—то из пони мог сбежать с родины на судне такого размера, она не понимала. Скорее всего, это была удача, или же один из немногих кораблей, которые стояли в порту во время революции.\n\nЕё ход мыслей оборвался, когда она увидела, как спускаются пассажиры. Вереница низших дворян, несколько генералов, несколько солдат и несколько обычных граждан покинули плавучую развалюху; вскоре за ними последовала остальная команда. Хотя их было немного, их было больше, чем она ожидала. Даже её люди были почти равнодушны к мечте о возвращении Северяны, но лучше несколько пони, чем совсем никого. Им нужны были все изгнанники, которых они могли достать копытами, и это было началом, если не больше."

Алесия ответила и её голос эхом отразился от стен собора.\n\n— Будешь ли ты, со всеми дарованными тебе полномочиями, править, руководствуясь в первую очередь её волей, а во вторую—своей мудростью; с милосердием ко всем своим подданным? продолжала Говорящая с Луной, речь звучала громко.\n\n— Клянусь.\n\n— Будешь ли ты в меру своих сил поддерживать волю Найтмер и истинное исповедание Её Святейшества? Будешь ли ты во всей своей дарованной силе поддерживать клятвы твоих предков, данные до тебя? Будешь ли ты, с этими дарами от нашей богини, что растит луну, делать все, что в твоих силах, чтобы служить своему народу прежде всего?\n\n—  Всё это я обещаю сделать. То, что я обещала раньше, я выполню и сдержу; да поможет мне Найтмер. Она закончила, тихо гадая про себя, будет ли их божество действительно радо её вознесению.\n\nПоследовала ещё одна церемония, помазание и обеспечение; все прошло без проблем, как и ожидалось для такого отрепетированного события, как это. Алесии не нужно было много думать, она лишь стоически сидела в своем королевском кресле, пока не пришло время получить недавно изготовленные драгоценности короны. Когда Лунар водрузила корону на её голову, а сидящие сановники встали, чтобы спеть старый Северянский гимн, Царица Алесия стояла, прижав копыто к груди и думая только об одном."

По какой—то причине спор, казалось, иногда выходил за рамки обычных разногласий между ваксистами и ревивалистами, и поэтому казалось, что его невозможно урегулировать.\n\nОдна половина говорящих с Луной хотела оставить дату как есть, считая, что нет причин её менять, так как это уже был ожидаемый национальный праздник. Другие, воспользовавшись возможностью нового руководства для продвижения своей повестки дня, хотели заново открыть тот день в году, который должен был быть изначально; как будто действительно имело значение, в какое время года отмечается Найтмер. По мнению Алесии, очевидным временем для этого, если это вообще имело значение, было бы зимнее солнцестояние. Но, учитывая агрессивный тон, который проявлялся уже в третий раз за сегодня, она решила, что это не её битва.\n\nЦарица опустилась в кресло и подавила зевок, когда снова начались крики, соблазнившись молитвой о своём медленно убывающем терпении и здравомыслии."

Они никогда не испытывали недостатка в мастерстве или преданности, только в командовании и надлежащем применении на поле боя. Учитывая ваши планы по созданию имперской армии, их роль в вооружённых силах будет радикально отличаться от традиционной хироптеррской доктрины. Они будут работать вместе с основной массой солдат в качестве ударной силы или авангарда, в зависимости от ситуации.\n\nЛайтнинг Чарм была более чем счастлива, что наконец-то получила шанс реформировать легионы, что было бы ясно, даже если бы она не просила об этом специально. У неё было странное выражение восторга на лице, несмотря на стоическое спокойствие, которое она и другие лорды и леди-командиры обычно демонстрировали. Алесия и сама была взволнована, учитывая, что у неё ещё не было возможности увидеть легионы в условиях, когда они не стреляют в неё.\n\nНа тренировочном поле находилось от шестидесяти до восьмидесяти пони, выполнявших различные упражнения. Очевидно, это были новобранцы, хотя она не смогла бы этого определить. Их дисциплина уже казалась несокрушимой, несмотря на то, что, по имеющимся данным, они находились в процессе набора всего несколько недель. Их инструктор заметил наблюдающую пару и приказал быстро перейти к спаррингу, который больше походил на активные попытки убить друг друга, чем на тренировку. Их скорость и мастерство владения всем, от клинков и от стрелкового оружия до копыт и крыльев, были просто невероятны.\n\nЛайтнинг подняла взгляд от своего планшета: — Это все, Госпожа Воительница?"

Normally he would have been curled up, careful not to damage any of his wares that were typically stacked up around him. He hadn't been totally cleaned out in his most recent visit to the new imperial capital, but the space around him was proof enough that he'd sold a lot more than usual. In fact, most of the remaining weight back here were goods that the stallion had purchased himself.\n\nHe hadn't earned this much in a day for more than a decade.\n\nYet, in spite of this payday, Silk was conflicted. He was a Warzenan zebra, not a Tobuckian and certainly not a Severyanian one. His new overlords were zealous, proud, disciplined and traditional; but they had also brought stability and revitalised both the import and export market that he needed to survive.\n\nReally though, when he thought about it, he had already taken a side. By not opposing the new status quo and profiting from it he had effectively resigned himself to service of Warzenia's enemies by default.\n\nThe zebra grunted and turned on his pillow, trying not to think about it."

tobuck_alesia.24.d:0 "'HALT!' bellowed the feldfebel. 'Aten—SHUN!' Initially, upon being assigned command of a company of fresh troops for the Tsaritsa's Yasani Guard, he was insulted, thinking them little more than bullies and paramilitary thugs, hardly befitting a seasoned Severyanian exile officer such as himself. So far, however, they had exceeded his expectations. His little platoon of zebras was excellently well turned—out in their dark uniforms. The feldfebel was still amazed that they could possibly stand the heat in all black. Then again, they were Zarantian zebras, natives to these arid climes, and he wasn't. He was very supportive of their retention of the sword as a weapon alongside the rifle, feeling it preserved some shred of honour. The old colt admired a warrior who had the courage to wield one on a modern battlefield.\n\nThe troops had now formed into two files. They were in the front room of the local army headquarters, and several bureaucrats and top brass officers were peering from their offices down the hall towards them, to see what the noise was about. On the wall in front of the squad was a newly—installed painting of Her Imperial Majesty, the Tsaritsa. The feldfebel roared 'Left FACE!', quickly followed by 'Pre—sent ARMS!' and it was done in under a second. 'At my command, you will salute your Tsaritsa and pledge loyalty to her as long as you may live! Sa—LUTE!' The platoon roared back, in their strongly accented voices; 'WE SALUTE YOUR IMPERIAL MAJESTY, AND PLEDGE TO SERVE YOU UNTO DEATH!'\n\nAs they did, the underofficer dipped the colours and the feldfebel saluted with his sabre, following along with the salute and oath. As the echo from the hallway faded the feldfebel shouted,'Right then! Shoulder arms! Left face! By the left, quick march!' The platoon marched off, their hooves kicking characteristically high as they stepped. The feldfebel looked smugly at the desk workers withdrawing their heads back into their offices like snails into their shells. They were stuck here all day, pen—pushing and paper—stacking, yet he had the privilege to put his life on the line for Tsaritsa and company. He looked back to the marching zebras and thought; THOSE are the warriors I would choose on that day, the desk—dwellers can keep their comfortable cubicles." #sirnori

tobuck_alesia.25.d:0 "Alesia sat in a meeting where a fierce argument raged over the issue of the labourers, with the table divided between Chiropterran and Severyan officials. The former wished to continue the old labour system to its due end, justifying the choice as means to the end of rapid industrial reconstruction and frequently pointed out that freed labourers could become a potential security risk. The Severyans argued that even a short—term reliance on slavery would hinder the economic growth across the tsardom, especially as Tobuck continues to industrialize. In the end she slammed her hoof onto the convention table to call on a silence for a decision, tired of the endless bickering that seemed to follow her wherever she went.\n\n"I have no fondness for either the reality or idea of indentured servitude; even Old Severyana, flawed as it may have been, had no need nor want of slaves. However, it is true that the institution could serve as a slingshot into future prosperity should it last a little longer."

Though some historians asses the original Severyana as imperfect in a number of ways, the chaos and confusion caused by Steel Stallion and his comrades undeniably caused more economic, cultural and social damage than their communist ideals can hope to fix. Their revolution was brutal, unnecessary and has resulted in a factionalist government far more unstable than the one it sought to replace.”\n\nHis teacher smiled and nodded before continuing, “Thank you Egor. We also noted that Alesia and her government have rectified or simply avoided all of the mistakes that our ancestors made, which is covered in our textbook as part of the next topic 'Lessons Learned' if you wish to read ahead.”\n\nA few nodded, acknowledging what was to be a homework task for them. Lebedintseva was a strict teacher with that sort of thing, but she got you the grades you needed.\n\nShe cleared her throat and lifted her own copy of the text, “Now, today's lesson will focus on another reason as to why the homeland fell to ruin.

She might even have been the same painter, though there was no way to know for sure.\n\n“Enamoured, sir?” The old artist joked, dragging the stallion out of his stupor.\n\nThe noble cleared his throat before speaking again in a more serious tone, “I must admit that I am. I would like to sponsor your work, missus...?”\n\n“Ivanova, sir. Anzhelina Ivanova. I would be honoured to work for you and the Tsaritsa.” She answered, bowing to the appropriate depth despite her age.\n\nHe spent the next half an hour engrossed in her other works, ignoring the noise of the hall. Like many others ponies here that had escaped the lost homeland she had either produced some form of fine art for nobility before the revolution or was capable of emulating it. At the behest of the Tsaritsa all creative types that could prove themselves capable were to find themselves patronage and work for a number of years; creating new masterworks to revitalise the old Severyanian traditions of painting, sculpting, architecture and more."

This was a concept he supported in and of itself, but he hadn't quite prepared himself for the realities of the lowly and destitute.\n\nThe still—young noble had to watch silently as old, ill, disfigured and truly hurt ponies and zebras of all ages entered through the front door of the venue wearing tattered rags. He quickly got used to their awful smell the longer he served them food and acclimatised to the lack of respect as he took them to their beds. He knew now just how lucky he was to be born into his position and why the tsaritsa had demanded these measures. They ate as though they had never before eaten, slept as though they never had a bed and moved as though every part of their body was turning to dust.\n\nSeeing what he had seen, knowing what he knew now, he would never again neglect his duty to even the most detestable of Severyanian society.

It had been a few days now since her tenant peasants had first refused to work the fields, but Serafina Nikolaeva was far from giving in to their demands. She was a noble and the Tsaritsa along with her personal security detail at the gate would protect her from this rabble of miserable wretches. Who were they to tell her how much she should pay and how much she should charge?\n\nJust as she had that thought, a familiar noise met her ears. A carriage, assumedly containing a judicial herald, and two trucks which would be carrying their soldiers. She stood up and trotted over to her mansion's front gate with a smug grin. The gaggle of peasants had heard too and the look of defeat on their faces was already present; now they would finally leave her in peace.\n\nWhen the carriage and its vehicular procession arrived, the herald and his soldiers exited quickly to meet both the now demoralised peasants and Serafina who had decided to greet them; thinking that she had already won.\n\nHowever, instead of exchanging pleasantries, the judicial herald cleared his throat and spoke; flanked by armed soldiers. “In the case brought to us by Lady Nikolaeya, the local judge and court has reached a verdict: Lady Nikoloaeya, you are found guilty of charging exploitative rent prices and underpaying your labour force. According to Her Majesty's decree, you must reimburse said labour force for the equivalent of six months' rent and double the salaries of these fine citizens.”\n\nUtter shock followed on both sides. Then the crowd erupted into cheers as the noblepony exploded with rage, hurling insults and threats at the herald until his entourage levelled their guns at her.\n\n“Madame, are you protesting the perfect law of Her Majesty and the Nightmare?” He asked simply, prompting her own guards to stand down."

My name is Pyotr Luchnikov; here, I have a gift for you.”\n\nIn spite of the restrictions on weapons he had brought in a sword, likely by hiding it underneath his greatcoat in some way. The guards around them were already rushing to arrest him as he presented his weapon to the Tsaritsa, unsheathing it and offering the weapon as a gesture of fidelity. Before they could grab him, Alesia held up a hoof and ordered them to wait; even allowing herself to laugh at the absurdity of what he had just done.\n\nShe took the weapon, inspected it, sheathed it and then passed it back. “Your offer is kind and accepted, however I must ask why you decided to completely ignore our rule of no arms on the premises; was it in your interests to be arrested?”\n\n“I am of the opinion that such a rule is entirely unnecessary. Why should I, or any of your other loyal subjects for that matter, raise my weapon at my liege?” He asked rhetorically, rising from his bow.\n\nHer Majesty couldn't help but laugh a second time before waving away the guards."

It's been a long time since we were young lovers running through the streets Koloda, time has flown by.”\n\nHe laughed loudly and practically threw himself onto a garden cushion, next to the lunch that his wife had just put on the garden table. They both sighed and stared at the Novaya Severyanian flag that he, in his patriotism, had attached to the back of the vehicle.\n\nThe pegasus mare chuckled and sat down next to him as he began to eat, savouring the taste of the food that had been made with their own crops along with some flowers that she had bought as a special treat. They had been relatively rich peasant famers in Equus, but was a far better that life had ever been in spite of the occupational similarities. The opportunity for a better life had called them here, now they were reaping the rewards of that making the right choices in that fateful time in their lives.\n\n“This is definitely better.

I'll make sure to broaden my knowledge for the future.”\n\nAlesia simply nodded and smiled, in as comforting a fashion as she could manage. There was no reason to punish a servant for this, they were still getting used to the new way of doing things after all. Much like herself, really. She still wasn't used to hearing the already—present cheers from the crowd in the palace grounds, she still wasn't used to being treated like royalty and she certainly still wasn't used to being treated like some sort of holy messenger from the Nightmare. But, as time went on, she felt more at home here as a ruler and a guiding figure. It was hard, but it was rewarding.\n\nThere was much to do yet, eradicating communism and securing her borders in a more permanent fashion were the two things that sprung to mind immediately. For today however, those goals could wait. For today, she could enjoy herself.\n\n“Your Highness, we're finished.” The zebra said quietly, a smile forming on his face.\n\nShe made a little bow in thanks before stepping towards the window doors and the balcony.

But, after a long and arduous discussion over telegrams and letters, her aunt and brother had eventually agreed to at least stay for a while.\n\nThe car slowed to a stop, Alesia thanked her chauffeur and trotted the last few metres until the docks. Soldiers had been sparsely placed around, though she was in little danger here in Firstport. After all, the Chiropterrans loved her.\n\nAs she descended a ramp with two guards from the gate following in tow the earth pony rested her eyes on the ship in which her family must have just arrived.

This was the least the Tsaritsa could do to make up for lost time.\n\nAlesia took a sip of tea from her porcelain cup and smiled, “I do have things to be doing, but that doesn't mean I can ignore the head of the family. Even if I hadn't any obligation to visit you I think it more than appropriate to ensure that you feel comfortable in your lodgings. I don't suppose you've attended church, have you?”\n\n“Actually, I have.” she quickly corrected, no longer afraid to admit her ardent belief in the Nightmare. “It's not what I was expecting.”\n\nThe monarch raised an inquisitive eyebrow and took another sip, simply waiting for her aunt to elaborate on the subject. She was very much aware of the mare's leanings and needed to do very little in order to encourage her.\n\nWith a contemplative frown, Karina nodded. “Yes, it was quite something; especially being so used to our typically private worship in Equestria. The thestrals certainly know what they're doing.”\n\n“And will you attend again?” Alesia asked, curious more than anything else.\n\n“I think I shall.

tobuck_military.1.d:0 "Было неудивительно, что наёмники требовали свою зарплату. Технически говоря, им платило государство, но Пиа Шутер фактически не смог предоставить никакого финансирования. Этот вопрос требовалось решить как можно скорее, чтобы у командиров не закончились излишки добычи, которыми они могли бы заполнить карманы своих солдат.\n\nБыли предложены две идеи: одна исходила от самих войск, а другая от их генералов. Первые просто хотели, чтобы им платили обычными деньгами, поскольку у них были трудности с использованием своих военных трофеев при попытке купить товары в магазинах или отправить наличные своим семьям; их решение состояло в том, чтобы просто завершить государственные контракты и таким образом заработать. Однако у их офицеров была другая идея. Вместо этого они предложили, чтобы их жалованье выплачивалось в виде акций государственных горнодобывающих компаний. Таким образом, они могли постепенно зарабатывать больше с течением времени по мере расширения бизнеса, что в конечном итоге приводило бы к увеличению итоговых выплат.\n\nОбе концепции были жизнеспособны, оставляя решение в конечном счёте за администрацией."

Dozens and then hundreds of §CMoonspeakers§! came around, seeking to sweep the dust and remove the cobwebs of the house of §YNightmare Moon§!. Faced with such a boiling desire for revival and renewal of the faith, §YAlesia§! has called a grand council to talk of matters of faith. Despite the allure of a great spiritual meeting between the §CMoonspeakers§! and their new heraldess of dusk, the council is also at its core a matter of base politics. Two factions have emerged among the §CMoonspeakers§! which §YAlesia§! will have to contend with according to her interests. Both seek a return to the spirit of the early days of the faith but couldn't be more different as how they seek to return to it.\n\nThe §gRevivalist§! believe that §CChiropterran§! society as a whole grew compromising and lax and so, as they seek the revival of §YNightmare Moon§!, their diagnosis is that the faith should be as she left it. Sacred traditions ought to be restored and stand unquestioned, protected by §CMoonspeakers§! acting as guardians of the dogma.\n\nThe §FWaxists§! on the other hoof call upon the image of the waxing moon, explaining that it was the §CMoonspeakers§! themselves rather than society who grew blinded by a twisted and erratic interpretation of the faith.

TBK_warlord_reliance_desc:0 "When Tobuck proclaimed its independence, it had no army, just mercenaries, a lot of guns and some bits. With their charm, Pea Shooter and Vasile Cel Tradat managed to convinced a few promising adventurer and costly friends to set up their own forces. Each was given a provincial governorate to make their job of defending the country easier and while it did provide an effective defending forces, there might be some issues in relying on warlords."

TBK_zarantian_loyalism:0 "Zarantian Loyalism"
TBK_zarantian_loyalism_desc:0 "A former Warzenan province, Tobuck soured on its historical master for many a reason. And so, when queens of the desert came and liberated them, they embraced her as their savior. It proved a successful choice as the Zarantian wished for a richer region to use as their center of power. The Storm King brought an end to the promising future of the Kingdom of Zarantia and Tobuck had its fate decided for them by a clique of innovative businesscreatures as they call themselves. In the end, it's not hard to understand why the merchants and citizens of Tobuck have a nostalgia for the Zebra Queen of the east. And should Mekiouzza come for them, they will help her."

### Wallnut path ideas

TBK_social_visionary:0 "Visioranism"
TBK_social_visionary_desc:0 "Whoever said that whatever we look at now is what we should be seein'? There's nothing wrong with a lil' experimentation, especially not if it's at the expense of whichever establishment decides to try and censor it! Come on lads, show 'em what you can do!"

TBK_bat_propaganda:0 "Horrors of Chiropterra"
TBK_bat_propaganda_desc:0 "Whatever folks might say about Chiropterra is probably true, even the worst of rumours could well have some sorta basis in that tartarus—hole of a country. Still, makes us fight all the harder to make well sure they don't get their hooves on us an' our families, eh?"

TBK_pride_work:0 "Worker's Pride"
TBK_pride_work_desc:0 "Unlike that nasty 'Labourer' system the Chiropterrans seem so fond of, our own workers are more than capable of takin' pride in their own creations and bein' well paid for 'em! Ain't nothing like a little reward for a good day's work in the factory!"

### Wallnut harmony ideas

TBK_democratic_vision:0 "Democratization"
TBK_democratic_vision_desc:0 "Bringing democracy to a place like Tobuck, and Chiropterra for that matter, is no easy task. In fact, it’s probably one of the single hardest things any government has tried to implement around these parts. All the same, these things need to happen in order for Harmony and a truly democratic environment to be achieved."

TBK_harmonic_federation:0 "Balance of Power"
TBK_harmonic_federation_desc:0 "Trying to make things work between two opposed ideals is always hard, but it’s not impossible. With a little luck and a little more careful work we can make sure that the balance of power remains and that politics stay fine and dandy. After all, the least we can do for all our revolutionary reforms is attempt not to make a mess in the process."

TBK_repayment:0 "Repayments"
TBK_repayment_desc:0 "Though many see such expenses as frivolous and an insult as most of the money is going to those that just tried to annex our beloved city, the fact remains that we are now a nation of many Chiropterrans as well as Tobuckians. If we wish them to integrate peacefully into our society then we must encourage them to stay and to cooperate with the state."

TBK_open_elections:0 "Campaign Season"
TBK_open_elections_desc:0 "Ah, election campaigns; for once they’re not even rigged in favour of the incumbency! It’s our duty to make sure every creature in the federation has a say in one way or another; the best way to do that is making sure they know who they can vote for, right?"

TBK_democratic_vision_final:0 "The Constitution of U.L.N.Z"
TBK_democratic_vision_final_desc:0 "Codifying a constitution is an integral part of guaranteeing the rights of citizens as well as ensuring that the functionality of and balance of power within the government cannot simply be overturned. Democratic harmony is a perfect and malleable answer to all future questions, after all."

TBK_ulz_police_lar:0 "National Police Force"
TBK_ulz_police_lar_desc:0 "Tobuck was never a safe place and the military police that Chiropterra relied on in order to keep the peace weren’t exactly an enticing organisation to utilise.

TBK_ulz_police_lar_final:0 "S.T.D"
TBK_ulz_police_lar_final_desc:0 "Legally an extension of the National Police force, the Special Tactical Directive is an elite government secret service that protects the population and their representatives.

TBK_harmonic_federation_final:0 "Harmonic Federation"
TBK_harmonic_federation_final_desc:0 "As it is sometimes said, societies should define the state and the people have now spoken. From the ashes of a sham republic, they have built a harmonious state for a harmonious society of cooperation and reform; the federation as an entity is as much their ally and their protector as it is a beast of their own creation."

TBK_public_works_idea:0 "Federal Public Works"
TBK_public_works_idea_desc:0 "State funded infrastructure projects are the next step in building and expanding on the existing civilian economy within the federation. Our Hazrumenian family will prosper for the benefit of every individual within that very same family. Onwards and upwards, let us cooperate together to strive for a better tomorrow!"

TBK_reconstruction_idea:0 "Federal Construction Bureau"
TBK_reconstruction_idea_desc:0 "There is much to do in the reconstruction and further development of the land and industry following the nigh-cataclysmic war with Chiropterra. We shall build back stronger than before and we are making significant headway in rebuilding what was lost in order to prosper further off of it. The future waits for nopony!"

TBK_ensure_work:0 "Right of Employment"
TBK_ensure_work_desc:0 "Every creature under the purview of the state has a right to education and a right to be gainfully employed. It is the duty of the federation to provide opportunities for those that fall through the cracks, however small they may be, and to ensure that they lead a life worth living."

TBK_vocational_education_system:0 "Vocational Education System"
TBK_vocational_education_system_desc:0 "If there’s one thing that students are doing after school these days, it’s practical studies and getting work experience. They’re acquiring much needed skills and a bigger labour pool is never something to avoid. The state will continue running programmes to make sure they leave education with the knowledge they need to go right into work!"

TBK_research_benefits:0 "Research Benefits"
TBK_research_benefits_desc:0 "If there’s one thing that students are doing following their stints in schools these days, it’s further education. We’ll always need more forward-thinking innovators to propel the federation into a new age and the state makes sure that every student knows that they have every opportunity to contribute to science so long as they live!"

TBK_free_market_economics:0 "The Invisible Hoof"
TBK_free_market_economics_desc:0 "Though the state keeps an eye on things, the economy always has the guiding hoof of the free market to sort out even the most troubling of situations. Supply and demand trumps all other factors when considering the economy and so every citizen of the federation knows how to encourage further national prosperity."

TBK_expanded_agricultural_sector:0 "Agriculture Boon"
TBK_expanded_agricultural_sector_desc:0 "Agriculture has long been the foundation for every civilisation and the federation has embraced such. In every arable region a visitor will see sprawling fields of farms that cover the land in a variety of foodstuff and cash crops, underpinning the federal economy with exports and food autarky in the case of conflict or diplomatic isolation."

TBK_new_bit:0 "U.L.N.Z Bit"
TBK_new_bit_desc:0 "A federation united in currency is a federation that can maintain a stable fiscal situation, both in terms of inflation and regarding the international trust in our currency. Stability brings prosperity and prosperity brings yet more prosperity. Invest in the federation now and see the stacks you put in grow every day!"

TBK_investments:0 "Financial Investments"
TBK_investments_desc:0 "Investing is just spending money to earn money and every savvy businesscreature knows it; that’s one of the reasons why the state has invested in the growing industries of the federation, knowing that it can cash out at a later date for returns! If the government can trust the industries to grow, then so can everyone else!"

TBK_national_investments:0 "Subsized Industries"
TBK_national_investments_desc:0 "Though growth guarantees returns, there are some industries so vital that the state is willing to assist in their growth by providing subsidies and increasing their margins exponentially.

TBK_free_economic_growth_desc:0 "Though new industries are having a little trouble getting off of the ground, the government’s policy of non-interference in the economy has nevertheless paid dividends.

### Wallnut communist ideas

TBK_wallnut_faction_balance_normal:0 "The Scarlet Scale—Balanced"
TBK_wallnut_faction_balance_normal_desc:0 "The competing factions under Dusk Wane and Niftyn currently have total parity within the government."

TBK_wallnut_faction_balance_dusk_small:0 "The Scarlet Scale—Slight Dusk Advantage"
TBK_wallnut_faction_balance_dusk_small_desc:0 "The balance of power has shifted slightly towards Dusk Wane and his syndicalist faction. Niftyn and his followers are suspicious, causing minor unrest."

TBK_wallnut_faction_balance_dusk_medium:0 "The Scarlet Scale—Growing Dusk Advantage"
TBK_wallnut_faction_balance_dusk_medium_desc:0 "The balance of power has noticeably shifted towards Dusk Wane and his syndicalist faction. Niftyn and his follwers are growing restless as a result of the imbalance of power and infighting has begun within the administration."

TBK_wallnut_faction_balance_dusk_large:0 "The Scarlet Scale—Overwhelming Dusk Advantage"
TBK_wallnut_faction_balance_dusk_large_desc:0 "The balance of power has overwhelmingly shifted towards Dusk Wane and his syndicalist faction. Fights within the administration have escalated and at times have led to deadly consequences. Both organisations have resolved to arm themselves, fearful of the opposition."

TBK_wallnut_faction_balance_niftyn_small:0 "The Scarlet Scale—Slight Niftyn Advantage"
TBK_wallnut_faction_balance_niftyn_small_desc:0 "The balance of power has shifted slightly towards Niftyn and his stallionist faction. Dusk Wane and his followers are suspicious, causing minor unrest."

TBK_wallnut_faction_balance_niftyn_medium:0 "The Scarlet Scale—Growing Niftyn Advantage"
TBK_wallnut_faction_balance_niftyn_medium_desc:0 "The balance of power has noticably shifted towards Niftyn and his stallionist faction. Dusk Wane and his follwers are growing restless as a result of the imbalance of power and infighting has begun within the administration."

TBK_wallnut_faction_balance_niftyn_large:0 "The Scarlet Scale—Overwhelming Niftyn Advantage"
TBK_wallnut_faction_balance_niftyn_large_desc:0 "The balance of power has overwhelmingly shifted towards Niftyn and his stallionist faction. Fights within the administration have escalated and at times have led to deadly consequences. Both organisations have resolved to arm themselves, fearful of the opposition."

TBK_wallnut_faction_balance_scarlet_war:0 "The Scarlet War"
TBK_wallnut_faction_balance_scarlet_war_desc:0 "All across the land, a shadow civil war has broken out between the rival factions within the federal government. Townhouses and ministries have turned into battlefields between Dusk's unions and Niftyn's party, spilling out to the streets in the townships and cities. Common people hide and cover as bullets whistle and grenades explode. The entire state apparatus is crippled while the army remains on the sidelines, content to observe the situation for now."

TBK_wallnut_faction_balance_scarlet_war_aftermath:0 "The Scarlet Scars"
TBK_wallnut_faction_balance_scarlet_war_aftermath_desc:0 "The shadow civil war has come to an end thanks to intervention by Generalissimo Wallnut and the federal army. While the conflict only raged for a few weeks, its scars are bare and visible all across the U.L.N.Z. It will take time before life returns to normal and hatred between the factions can be resolved."

TBK_legionare_terrorism:0 "Legionnaire Terror"
TBK_legionare_terrorism_desc:0 "While Chiropterra has been defeated, her army isn't gone: in the forests and hills of former Chiropterra, former soldiers continue to wage war against the occupiers. Terror attacks are common occurance within the urban centers and in many locations the local sympathisers shield the terrorists from federal soldiers."

TBK_legionare_terrorism_lower:0 "Legionnaire Terror"
TBK_legionare_terrorism_lower_desc:0 "While Chiropterra has been defeated, her army isn't gone: recent actions by the federal government have been succesful in combatting the legionnaire threat and their popular support. While urban centers have been secured, the fight still continues in the rural communities where the legionnaires prepare for their last stand."

TBK_autonomous_communities:0 "Communal Administration"
TBK_autonomous_communities_desc:0 "Decentralised administration of the state through unionisation at a local level alongside communal agriculture has proven to be effective, if initially rather messy as citizens have taken some time to adjust. The positive results regarding the growth of regional industries appears to be no coincidence."

TBK_socialist_police:0 "Federal Police Force"
TBK_socialist_police_desc:0 "Though established primarily as a means through which to eliminate the Chiropterran resistance, the federal police force has proven to be very effective in a civilian role. They dutifully serve the state and its citizens; though militarised enough to respond to even the most severe calls, they always try to put on a friendly face for their fellow workers."

TBK_nic:0 "National Identity Card"
TBK_nic_desc:0 "The concept of a National Identity Card is fairly simple in concept and in application, but it has important benefits far beyond simply making our citizens identifiable. Though it remains somewhat of a hushed rumour amongst the public, it is very much true that these documents are immensely beneficial for state security. It's easy to know who has escaped with information when one of the suspects is listed as a recent immigrant, after all."

TBK_labour_visionary:0 "Labour Visionarism"
TBK_labour_visionary_desc:0 "The is an ideal worker: one that never tires and has an unlimited capacity to contribute to the socialist dream. Whilst this is a biological impossibility, it is an ideal that can be strived for; something that should be an aim for every citizen of the federation. Every pony, zebra and thestral understands that they are not perfect, but that they can be more than just themselves. That they too can be a visionary."

TBK_unions_pride:0 "Unions' Pride"
TBK_unions_pride_desc:0 "The question that so often arises when nationalism is thrown out of the picture is how any creature is supposed to take pride in themselves and their nation. The solution has proven very simple. Pride in a more decentralised identity as part of a union has replaced the ridiculous notion that any one society is naturally greater than another."

TBK_worker_equality:0 "Home of the Workers"
TBK_worker_equality_desc:0 "In a society of truly equal workers, all may speak and theorise as to how they may best contribute to society for their fellow proletarian creatures. Innovation and technological progress are an inherent part of any socialist doctrine, and so both are encouraged!"

TBK_union_factory_ownership:0 "Autonomous Production Councils"
TBK_union_factory_ownership_desc:0 "If there's one thing workers love, it's managing their work themselves. Sure they sometimes raise their own wages, but with a little oversight and a lot of trust they've proven the system to be a great motivating factor in their occupations. In fact, production has never looked better!"

TBK_union_factory_ownership_final:0 "Autonomous Production Councils"

In fact, production has never looked better!"

TBK_communal_hubs:0 "Communal Life"
TBK_communal_hubs_desc:0 "A burden shared is a burden halved, so they say. Communal living has long been a staple of socialism and it is no different here; though unlike other socialist states we provide our workers with the very best living standards that they deserve as loyal and liberated citizens of a socialist state!"

TBK_federation_labour:0 "Federation of Labour"
TBK_federation_labour_desc:0 "Unity through the means of production is a concept that combines the idea of a worker's identity with the class consciousness inherent in the understanding of a creature's control over the means of production. Our federation is one of production and union, a true society of labour."

TBK_rights_bill:0 "Bill of Rights"
TBK_rights_bill_desc:0 "Not only does our bill of rights guarantee the usual things such as freedom to protest and freedom of speech—with important caveats of course—it also covers uniquely socialist ideas such as the right to unionise and the right to work. It has unsurprisingly been received well, particularly in the more developed parts of the country with large industrial districts."

TBK_national_unionization:0 "Unionization Frenzy"
TBK_national_unionization_desc:0 "Mass mobilisation has previously been achieved primarily through decadent ideas like revanchism and nationalism. We have instead utilised a system of mass participation which enables a voluntary and socialist mode of mobilisation. Unions for everyone and for everything!"

TBK_agricultural_revolution:0 "Agricultural Revolution"
TBK_agricultural_revolution_desc:0 "What's a good agricultural sector without the introduction of local collectives and modernised equipment? We have given the farmers both and the sheer volume of food produced has yielded a surplus for sale and for more foals. Field work doesn't seem so hard anymore."

TBK_agricultural_revolution_final:0 "Agricultural Revolution"
TBK_agricultural_revolution_final_desc:0 "What's a good agricultural sector without the introduction of local collectives and modernised equipment? We have given the farmers both and the sheer volume of food produced has yielded a surplus for sale and for more foals. Even the troops are eating better than ever!"

TBK_militia_union:0 "Union—Based Militias"
TBK_militia_union_desc:0 "There have long been informal militias in the federation, but under the system of unionisation they can be organised and better utilised. With just a little 'advertising' from the government there has been a massive surge in sign—ups for such groups, who themselves have sworn allegiance to Wallnut Drive and the federal army by extension."

TBK_militia_union_elected:0 "Union—Based Militias"
TBK_militia_union_elected_desc:0 "There have long been informal militias in the federation, but under the system of unionisation they can be organised and better utilised. With just a little 'advertising' from the government there has been a massive surge in sign—ups for such groups, a phenomenon that has only become more prevalent with the implementation of unit elections."

TBK_militia_union_comissars:0 "Union—Based Militias"
TBK_militia_union_comissars_desc:0 "There have long been informal militias in the federation, bbut under the system of unionisation they can be organised and better utilised. With just a little 'advertising' from the government there has been a massive surge in sign—ups for such groups which are under the complete jurisdiction of the armed forces thanks to the introduction of regimental commissars."

TBK_kgb_lar:0 "Internal Security Service"
TBK_kgb_lar_desc:0 "What is a strong socialist regime without great leaders and responsible individuals to defend it?

Our great leaders shall guide us as visionaries towards a brighter future for all!"

TBK_fortified_urban_centers:0 "Fortress Cities"
TBK_fortified_urban_centers_desc:0 "In the modern era, cities have become targets.

Despite holding no discernable political view or ambition of his own, he just helps smooth things over. He's just that nice!

TBK_tarnished_silver:0 "Tarnished Silver"
TBK_tarnished_silver_desc:0 "Tarnished Silver is a good friend of Cooper Spark for a reason. Not only is she a terrifying force in her own right—high functioning sociopaths can be as unnerving as they are tenacious and deadly—but the ISS has proven to be a morbidly effective institution. Yet, to their credit, the job is always done and it is always done well; no witnesses and no loose ends, we should perhaps consider limiting their powers at some point in the future."

### Navy Designers

TBK_Starting_Navy:0 "Imperial Marine"
TBK_Starting_Navy_desc:0 "Though the naval tradition in Tobuck is limited, the light ship companies established by the Storm King retain a surprisingly effective string of dockyards that should be more than capable of supplying the state with credible new—age technology for use in our navy."

### Air Designers

TBK_Starting_Fighters:0 "Thunderclap"
TBK_Starting_Fighters_desc:0 "Though their humble beginnings as naught but local textile workers drafted into manufacturing airship frabics are long over, the Thunderclap company remains if only in name. They are proud and talented engineers, a business known for their intelligence and their innovativeness in a world that requires their talents."
TBK_Starting_CAS:0 "Stormside Inc."
TBK_Starting_CAS_desc:0 "Much like their companions at Thunderclap, the origins of Stormside Incorporated can be traced back to the requirements for ground attack from the air in the designs of the Storm King. Though they are not so well rehearsed in modern fighter doctrines, there has been little to stop their cooperation with old corporate friends in making new air support."

### Tank Designers

TBK_Starting_Tank:0 "Zufra Steelworks"
TBK_Starting_Tank_desc:0 "Though not a tank producer by day, the Zufra Steelworks have created a market niche for themselves as producers of high quality metals and specifically of sprockets; the kind that could be easily retooled for military usage. Whilst unprepared to deal with heavier design specifications, they will have no problems providing the state with the means to produce light armour."

pea_shooter_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 17th of November 962 in St.Petershoof\n\n§YBiography§!: When Pea Shooter was just a foal, one could hardly picture the cheerful little one to become a gun runner. With a loving family, the loveliest of childhood crush turned happy wife and good prospect as a shipping merchant between St. Petershoof and Skyfall. But still, even with all of that, little Pea Shooter was bored.\n\nIt could have all ended with a simple middle—aged pony finding a hobby or drinking the occasional excessive cider but then came the Stalliongrad Revolution. His family's business was ruined but Pea Shooter saw an opportunity. With the help of a shady friend, he bought some guns from a Fezeran smuggler and travelled back home, selling them to a communist volunteer group. And also one Severyanian counter—revolutionary he had met in a bar. He made good bit on those deals and decided to make it his career. He travelled to Haukland, making some deals there before finding his way south, wherever there were bits and a need for gunpowder.\n\nIn 1005, he made his way to Zebrica, looking to make bank on that insane Yeti whilst he was still on a roll. He failed as the Storm King died and his conquest spree ended the following year. But! He was in Tobuck with some friends and it just so happened that one of those friends had friends guarding the supply depots in the region. And with half of Zebrica in turmoil, Pea Shooter exactly knew where to find his clientele.\n\nWith the help of Vasil Cel Tradat, he helped bring about the independence of Tobuck, the birth of harmonic republicanism in the region, found some pony to become its face while he became foreign affairs minister. As long as there was guns to sell in Tobuck, there would be business to do there for any good gun—runner.\n\nAnd Pea Shooter is more than a good one.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Bunnyshrubby"

Though he is incredibly personable and a delight to be around in general, his escape from Chiropterra during his brief stint in service with the legionnaires has left a particularly large target on his back. If the legions got their hooves on him now, he’d be on the chopping block.\n\nLucky for ‘the tricky thestral’ then that he has many friends that are willing to harbour and protect him, like Pea Shooter who was more than happy to hire a warlord with a distaste for one of the biggest security threats to his operation. His characteristic smile and capacity to converse even in matters far beyond his intellectual capacity make him a truly loveable pony, despite his typically accidental aloofness.\n\nHe’s well known for his rousing speeches, capacity to command, his love of drink and partying and his hatred of Chiropterra, something that drives him to do great things to this very day. A common joke amongst his ranks is that the only thing their general can’t do is talk to mares which, though none of them have seen him try, is entirely accurate.\n\nThough he may be a wanted criminal just across the border, Wallnut Drive is never one to shy away from a fight; nor is he one to pass up an opportunity to party, even at the most inconvenient of times.

baragzen_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 8th of July 975 in Zammar\n\n§YBiography§!: Baragzen is an exiled noble hailing originally from Warzena and now residing in Tobuck with dreams of one day returning to his home country. Much of his early life was spent in courtly education and becoming accustomed to his role as the heir to the head of the Leopard dynasty Waseem, his father. Most seemed to think that the family had been kept away from rule for so long that they were no longer relevant and Waseem seemingly agreed.\n\nAs he grew older, the young zebra began to slowly drift away from his family's dynastic policy of simple acceptance and instead started preparing for his family's 'inevitable' return to power. When his father passed, he became head of the family to little opposition or applause; his mother, Raaniya, attempted to persuade him to abandon his dreams of ascending the throne which resulted in a heated falling out. With no support even within his own immediate family, he ran away with a large part of the family coffers.\n\nThis would land him—and the significant amount of wealth he managed to smuggle out—in Tobuck which was a hotbed of instability and conflict during and following the rule of Storm King. There he would raise a small private army, one which grew rapidly as his renown and skill became widely known amongst mercenary circles. His success came partly from a natural talent which was being explored at the time of his exile in a military academy, but it was additionally thanks to the absolute loyalty that he commanded in his soldiers. He treated them with respect and dignity, even going so far as to enter the fray himself when his force was much smaller and commanding from the field.\n\nDuring the dissolution of the Storm King's realm and the establishment of Tobuck, Pea Shooter hired him in essence to ensure that he couldn't cause any trouble. Now Baragzen thrives as a warlord, commanding an irregular but disciplined force. He still hopes to return to Warzena and reclaim his birthright, but only time and a little luck will tell if he can achieve that dream.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Egil"

### Commander descriptions ###

TBK_clam_chowder_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 30th of September 973 in Applelaide\n\n§YBiography§!: Clam Chowder is, like almost all mercenaries in Tobuck, a foreigner. Born in far away New Mareland, she enlisted in the navy there as soon as her age permitted it but was repeatedly turned down for promotions thanks to her difficult relationship with whichever superior was unlucky enough to have her on board. Eventually her attitude would get her discharged which prompted her to steal a ship, a story she refuses to give details on, and sail off to find a navy in which her skill would be appreciated and where discipline was more of a suggestion.\n\nDespite initially seeing her arrival in Tobuck as an opportunity to make a name for herself, the mare has mellowed significantly over the years. Needless to say that she has also become a better and significantly more professional commander as a result, but she still dreams of commanding a larger flotilla than the pitiful number of ships in the Tobuckian fleet. She may yet get her wish.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: RyanManDraws"

TBK_great_pyre_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 4th of June 954 in Manehattan\n\n§YBiography§!: A selfless duty does not always bring glory and rewards to a soldier. Great Pyre witnessed this in 995, during the Severyana Revolution, where he fought as a sergeant in the Royal Guard. Only to be let go amongst other soldiers and officers for their actions in the fight against the communist revolutionaries. Instead of a peaceful life in Equestria, Great Pyre, bitter to the princess, left Equestria in the ranks of his fellow soldiers and joined with them in Zebrica as mercenaries, fighting not for glory but cold—hard cash.\n\n Yet service in the grand mercenary company was not enough for the ambitious stallion and he, with a core cadre of subordinates and local recruits, left to form their own mercenary band. This groud soon gained a ferocious reputation for their brutality and callous regard for life, bot theirs and the enemies. Rumours continued to swell, until across Northern Zebrica the company was dubbed the Band of Flayers: a name originally meant to mock their lust for loot to the point of looting the dead admist battle, Great Pyre eagerly adopted the name and further modified it by adding to it a motto. One which all members of the Band of Flayers adhered to.\n\n Down to the last fur!\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofuslied"

TBK_entin_miron_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 8th of October 970 in St. Petershoof\n\n§YBiography§!: Entin Miron is, in many ways, much like his commanding officer and friend Alesia Snezhnaya. He served in the Severyanan armed forces alongside her, spending years together in the academy and fighting the red rebels during the revolution. Intelligent, brave and dedicated; when observing the two working together many assume that the pair are related despite the differences in appearance.\n\nThough some believe otherwise, it was not the money or the loyalty to the exile cause that drove him to Zebrica. In fact, rather aptly, it was by her request that he boarded a ship and set sail for the southernmost continent. They have spent years in the north of the continent, fighting through innumerable wars including those waged in vain against the Storm King.\n\nThough he is skilled and, privately, wishes for a higher position in the military; most importantly he wants to look after his friend, no matter what she may get herself into.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofuslied"

TBK_pyotr_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 13th of February 957 in Princessyn\n\n§YBiography§!: Pyotr is a pony of much mystery, yet of great renown. Little is known of his service in Severyana beyond the fact that he was retired at the outset of the revolution and was called back into service for its duration. Having heard of Alesia's great successes in Zebrica he saw no reason not to see the great resurgence of his homeland abroad for himself.\n\nThough his strategy is outdated, his manner and personality are a welcome departure from the seriousness of modern war. Already he has made many genuine friends amongst the emerging nobility and the court, including the Tsartisa herself who has taken quite a liking to the old Stallion.\n\nMany wonder whether he has any real goals or even a desire for promotion, but really he seems to be having a wonderful time as is.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

At least not until the explosion. A giant novelty firecracker went off in his face when he was twelve, leaving him with a severe concussion, damaged hearing and a nervous twitch that never quite went away. Yet where others saw an accident, Cherry Bomb found his purpose.\n\nExperimenting with more and more extreme forms of explosives, he soon changed profession to developing explosives for the Equestrian military, only to be disillusioned with them as well due to their conservative approach. Instead, he left for abroad to offer his services as a freelancer. Whether it's in New Mareland blowing up Cockatrice nests, trying to sell the Brodfeld monarchy a new line of explosives or hobnobbing with Colthaginian patricians to secure funding for private arms factories, Cherry Bomb has done it all, and he prides himself on bringing explosions from the factory to the field.\n\nHis crew is a wild mix of all sorts of people, with Cherry Bomb having few qualms about who he works with. If you love explosives as much as he does, you'll have a job with his crew as they continue in their quest to discover and make use of every explosive in the world.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofuslied"

It all came to a head with White Star's ascension to the throne. Many had hoped she'd put him straight, but instead Spell Stock surrendered his property to the crown for a sizable sum and left Wittenland.\n\nTaking to the road, he used his wealth to build up a cadre of fellow hunters with the goal to hunt every monster the world had seen. Yet, in a steadily worsening world, he started to wonder if it wasn't the sapient creatures who were the true monsters. If it was, that meant that his hunting list had expanded something fierce. What more, it turned out being a mercenary paid better than a freelance hunter.\n\nHaving just finished a stint in Skyfall, he's arrived in Zebrica with a brand new "Rarity For You" suit, a vastly expanded hunting cadre and a plan to get himself trophies of every kind of threatening beast the continent can offer, and why yes that ambiguity was quite intentional.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofuslied"

TBK_captain_z_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 13th of March 968 in Colthage\n\n§YBiography§!: Once a highly respected Colthaginian officer, Bodzamal Aben commanded some of the nation's fiercest soldiers. He could have become a legend, but he made the mistake of going after the crime organisation known as the Tiger Syndicate. Though he scored several victories against them, corruption and moles within his unit led to him almost dying after being seduced by the wife of the Tiger Syndicate's leader.\n\nBarely escaping with his life, he saw how the fight against the syndicate slowly died out without him and bitterly concluded that they had patrician backing. He abandoned Colthage and has since become a gun for hire under the moniker "Captain Z". It was what he did best, and he liked doing it, so he decided it was time to make money off it instead of bleeding for a nation that seemed so willing to discard him.\n\nWhat more, one day he might have the money and the soldiers needed to go back and finish what he started. It's some ways off yet, but he's got a long time. The dead are patient, after all. \n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofuslied"

TBK_oborin_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 23rd of March 985 in Ravenskoye \n\n§YBiography§!: In truth, Oborin was nothing more than a junior officer at one of the Stalliongradian naval academies. Though talented, his career had hardly even started when he was given the offer of going overseas to some backwater state in Zebrica. Maybe it was his yearning for action, his barely—kempt brazenness or even the desire to impress his commanders; but he accepted the call to action nonetheless.\n\nHe was greeted with a small navy on arrival and a pang of disappointment when he realised why the senior officers hadn't been given this position overseas. Yet, thanks to assurances from Wallnut and some of his other staff, the young admiral is hopeful. Perhaps he'll amount to greatness yet, much to the assumed annoyance of his superiors back at home.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: RyanManDraws"

TBK_Myrga_Draconis_Desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 25th of June 792 in a cave \n\n§YBiography§!: Historically there have always been two things that successfully coax dragons from their caves: the promise of immense power or the draw of incredible wealth. Though desires for these things are most commonly exhibited in younger beasts who are yet to establish themselves, on occasion it will entice much older creatures to retire their positions of responsibility in search of personal glory. It was this very phenomenon that brought Myrga to Tobuck.\n\nFollowing a brief stint as a hatchery guard, a station notorious amongst dragons for the boredom it begets, the stench of overseas blood and money was nothing less than intoxicating. The death of the Storm King was an unspoken cue to visit, drawing the dragon overseas to the riches of the weapons trade and the conflicts that flared up as the remnant yeti forces were gradually ousted.\n\nThough initially scorned as a monster by contemporary generals, it soon became clear that he was curiously talented in complex matters of strategy despite his size and temprament. To the surprise of many, he has become better known for his protective nature and warding roar rather than his wartime brutality and occasionally overwhelming bloodlust.\n\nEven now, as a leader, he always has an excuse to dive personally into the fray. Luckily for us he's easy to keep on side, especially if we can provide battles to fight and plenty of goodies for his hoard. Nopony can deny the morale boost a dragon provides!\n\n§YPortrait By§!: OpalRadiance"

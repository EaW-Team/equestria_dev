CTH_MZO_fortify_the_east_desc:0 "The Star Father cannot be allowed to decimate the citizens of Zur, we will hold onto the region with everything we have and defeat him with our full might. To do this, we must foritfy our border with Gerza in the east so Colthage is not threatened."

CTH_MZO_hold_the_bagrazas_bank:0 "Reinforce the Bagraza's Bank"
CTH_MZO_hold_the_bagrazas_bank_desc:0 "The Eastern bank of the Bagraza is an amazing defensive position that we cannot sacrifice by trying to hold onto Zur. We shall holt this position while we wear down and defeat Gerza's forces, then we shall turn and destroy the Star Father and his cult."

CTH_MZO_at_all_cost_desc:0 "Colthage must produce everything we will need for our war against Gerza, so we need to get the economy into fighting shape.

CTH_MZO_declare_martial_law_desc:0 "To protect the people, one must make grave sacrificies. The days of Martial Law must return, the suspension of civil liberties to ensure the survival of the state is needed, and the entire country must be placed at the whim of the army if we are to continue to survive. Hopefully, the people shall forgive us one day."

CTH_MZO_first_servants_of_the_state_desc:0 "We are not alone in our fight against corruption and chaos, there are freedom loving creatures all accross the world, but mainly Kasa, who are willing to turn out and fight for democracy. They may be few in number, but we thank them all the same."

CTH_MZO_from_the_shadows:0 "From the Shadows"
CTH_MZO_from_the_shadows_desc:0 "We've made contact with resistance elements against the Star Father's rule in the Zapsa region. As the dictator moves his armies closer to Colthage we can assist these elements in making strikes on crucial rail lines that would supply the Covenant's frontlines."

CTH_MZO_colthage_greatest_legacy:0 "Colthage's Greatest Legacy..."
CTH_MZO_colthage_greatest_legacy_desc:0 "Our navy is our greatest ally in this fight against Tyranny. With many ships docked in the capital at the outbreak of the civil war, Zaphod has been hard at work trying to wrangle the navy in any way she can to further supply and assist our cause. We better be thankful, because without them we wouldn't survive for long."

CTH_MZO_cut_the_arteries:0 "Cut the Arteries"
CTH_MZO_cut_the_arteries_desc:0 "The rail line running from the Covenant capital in Hippone to Zur will likely be the Star Father's main line of attack towards the capital. If our navy can shell and destroy the railway we can hopefully deprive the Star Father of supplies for his army, lifting some pressure off of our troops."

CTH_MZO_seek_international_support:0 "Seek out International Support"
CTH_MZO_seek_international_support_desc:0 "With our government centered in an urban region and with almost no arable land to our name, we've had to come up with alternative solutions to the ongoing famine. Various charities and foreign nations have offered some food aid to us, and it is up to our navy to bring it all home. While we will likely one day need to pay for all of this, for now it is invaluable to be able to have full stomachs in the city."

CTH_MZO_her_last_friends:0 "...And Her Last Friends"
CTH_MZO_her_last_friends_desc:0 "With the Star Father's professional army and Gerza's mercenaries bearing down on us, we don't just need more and better troops. We need officers to lead them.

CTH_MZO_cash_win_wars:0 "The Lifeblood of Warring Nations"
CTH_MZO_cash_win_wars_desc:0 "Weapons and money, we need them both, and we need them badly. No nation can wage war without both, and we are chronically short. The Zarishatian regime had all its reserves stolen and its weapons scattered in rebel territory fighting the same scourges we now battle against. It is a regrettable thing, but we must now beg the people for donations."

CTH_MZO_race_to_trotkat:0 "The Race to Trotkat"
CTH_MZO_race_to_trotkat_desc:0 "The road to trotkat is not open, but it is flat! Monzano has experimented with importing old cars and armored vehicles from Griffonia to form new companies that might be the key to winning our war in the East."

CTH_MZO_rule_the_skies:0 "Rule the Skies"
CTH_MZO_rule_the_skies_desc:0 "The old Zarishatian air force project still has its home in the city of Colthage. Monzano helped the government pioneer it, and so she knows where all the equipment and aircraft is stored. It's time to uncover these planes and put them to work against our enemies."

CTH_MZO_death_from_above:0 "Death From Above"
CTH_MZO_death_from_above_desc:0 "Loading our soldiers into planes and dropping them on enemy positions in the east may sound like a risky idea, but it's risks we need right now to win back our nation."

CTH_MZO_zels_righteous_warriors_desc:0 "The clergy haven't been all that influential in Colthage in recent years, but in these times of complete chaos where each soldier fights for his survival against vicious enemies, some words of encouragement from the priests may be just what we need."

CTH_MZO_a_new_republic:0 "A New Republic"
CTH_MZO_a_new_republic_desc:0 "Colthage has been through a lot of governments in recent years. The Zarcid regime was... middling, the Constitutionalists betrayed the people, and the Zarishat regime brought out the worst in all of us. So where does the nation look to now for inspiration to fight on? Monzano believes there must be a new Republic, a new ideal to strive for, free of the chains of these past failures. A new future for all."

CTH_MZO_a_leader_is_a_dealer_in_hope:0 "A Leader is a Dealer in Hope"
CTH_MZO_a_leader_is_a_dealer_in_hope_desc:0 "A leader must give their people something to believe in, an idea to strive towards. The Star Father gave them ideas of race and an apocalyptic destiny, Gerza gave them normality and prosperity. What can Monzano offer?\n\nPerhaps, a new kind of hope."

colthage_monzano_cw.3.d:0 "As the soldiers stepped off the boat, Monzano couldn’t put her hoof on the feelings swirling in her soul. These brave few, these old and young, had volunteered to sail all the way from Kasa to serve in her army and defend Colthage. They arrived in fishing boats and trawlers, one by one stepping onto the dock in the Colthage harbor. Their ancestors had not lived here for centuries, but these souls made the choice to fight. Why??? She was of course grateful for them, but why do they do it? Feeling a tugging in her chest, Monzano began to walk towards the soldiers disembarking from the vessels. Clearing her throat, she awkwardly tried to get the attention of the few hundred soldiers in front of her. \n\n"Attention! Hey! Uhh, excuse me!"\n\nOne of Monzano’s soldiers tapped her in the shoulder and pushed over a barrel from the dock for her to stand on. Monzano thanked him and balanced carefully atop the precarious perch. "Soldiers of Kasa! Thank you all for coming to Colthage’s aid! Your courage is insurmountable in the face of these grave threats to... to umm..."\n\nMonzano felt torn, these stallions and mares deserved more than cookie-cutter nonsense. By now they were all looking at her, and she felt their confusion at her sudden halt. \n\nMonzano sighed and took a seat on the barrel. "I honestly can’t thank you all enough, to be fair I can’t understand why you would all risk everything to come to a land that enslaved your ancestors to fight a war that does not affect you. But thank you for coming to my aid. You all who hold freedom so deep in your hearts. I fight this war because it is a battle for the survival of my people, a selfish war. You fight for the preservation of another people. You are the noble few, and I salute you."\n\nMonzano got off the barrel and stood eye level with the Kasan soldiers, and raised her hoof in salute. One by one, the soldiers retuned the salute, and walked over to shake her hoof."

CTH_MZN_Jezabzella_Zeshmid_idea_desc:0 "Jezabzella Zeshmid wishes she could have spared Colthage the horrors of Zarishat, but it seems she wept for her brother more than she did. She has returned to the city of her birth to ensure the citizens of Colthage will not suffer any longer under insane cultists or zebras like Gerza who only care for themselves. While she is generally seen as a lady of high society, unsuited for war time, Jezabzella intends to prove to Monzano that when needed, she can bring the heat to the war room just as much as the dance floor."
CTH_MZN_Zalathel_Zarca_idea_desc:0 "Zalathel Zarca, once the most powerful Zebra in Colthage, thrown out of his seat of power by the Constitutionalists, has been on the sidelines for too long. He has wept watching his nation suffer under incompetent regime after incompetent regime, and while he always plotted his return, he never expected it to come so soon. Upon receiving Monzano's invitation, Zalathel flew into a flurry of action, bringing his siblings together and returning to his homeland with any supporters he still had, ready to retake his nation from insanity. And hopefully to one day be again on top."
MZN_Imin_Azkan_idea_desc:0 "Imin Azkan is... an oddity within Monzano's war cabinet. A minor patrician and a former member of Colthage's lower house during the Zarcid years, his inclusion in government came about after he assisted the government in fundraising efforts at the beginning of the civil war and met Monzano in the process. If you look a bit further in the past, one could find Azkan's numerous treatises on what he thinks Zarcid foreign policy should be. Books and papers that Monzano has taken a keen interest in as she looks towards the post civil war period. His connections smoothing tensions over other patricians don't hurt his case either."

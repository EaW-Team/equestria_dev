HIE_CTH_a14_desc: "No more shall the souls of the equines be corrupted by the Avian! These economic systems of the modern age are nothing more than ways the Avians tie us to this realm.

### Events ###
hippone_sekrit.1.t: "The Price Of War"
hippone_sekrit.1.d: "They stood atop a wooden stage, the design of which spoke more to function than form. An Equine of Gold stood before a podium, flanked by a team of Equine of Silver, all resplendent in the garb that denoted their lot in life. A scroll lay before him, upon which lay a proclamation passed down from the Star Father himself.\n\n"It has come to the attention of the Covenant," the Equine of Gold declared in a sonorous voice, "that deviant soul thieves have been working within the city of Zapsa, hoarding their great wealth to use against the good equines living within."\n\nFrightened murmurs broke out amongst the crowd as the masked legions of the Star Father marched a group of two dozen zebras into the center of the square. They were beaten bloody, but were easy to identify as prominent industrialists and their families who had made the city their home.\n\n"These creatures," the Equine of Gold spat, heedless of the clamoring that grew before him, "have attempted to subvert the purity of our kind by engaging in the decadent vice of capitalism. They have tried to pervert the will of the equine to that of the avian, and in so doing, let the promise of the Star Father fall to ruin."\n\nThe battered zebras were marched from the square into waiting trucks, which departed with a single word from the leading Equine of Silver.\n\n"Thus, the wealth of these creatures shall be turned against them and what they represent. Their treachery shall be used against their crypto-avian masters to the west, and we shall prove the purity of the Equine kind once and for all!""
hippone_sekrit.1.a: "Za'al-Maar must be fought in all its forms"

hippone_sekrit.2.t: "Body And Mind"
hippone_sekrit.2.d: ""Hear me, and rejoice oh spirits of equinity! You have the privilege of being saved by the great Star Father! While you may now experience suffering, soon, your souls will be pure. Accept these gifts from your Lord and Teacher." The mare paced slowly down the street of the ruined village, preaching to the masses of terrified and starving hiding within the alleyways. "By his wisdom, we equines of gold, silver, bronze, and iron are here to lift you up to the level of true equines."\n\nThe mare stopped as she came to what appeared to be the town center. Turning around, she stood up straight, the sun illuminating her suit jacket in the dusk glow, and began to speak again, "I am Jezalla Zaalatit. Equine of gold, and servant of the Star Father. I have come to offer relief to you all. As the chosen spirits, you all have a chance to refute the will of Za'al Maar. We offer you the chance to become what you are meant to be. You need only to submit to the teachings of the Master. The equines of silver shall distribute the food, approach them if you are ready to swear your lives to His teachings."\n\nAs she finished, zebras began limping out of the stores and houses that dotted the square. Each one was directed by an equine of silver to a group of equines of bronze and iron. They reported their craft, their family size, and their education. Those who may be warriors were taken on the spot to see if they were worthy of studying the arts of the Grandmasters. All others were sent to collect their charity."
hippone_sekrit.2.a: "Maybe the Star Father isn't so bad..."

hippone_sekrit.3.t: "A Safe Haven"
hippone_sekrit.3.d: ""Hear me, and rejoice oh spirits of equinity! You have the privilege of being saved by the great Star Father!" The mare walked at the head of a vast procession into the destroyed city of Zapsa. The city's modern architecture long since destroyed in the civil war. Hooves beat against the stone roads in a rhythmic pounding as the rows of zebras entered the city's limits, towards the large gathering.\n\n"You all have been brought here to witness something glorious, the equines of silver have brought you here to show you the teachings of the Star Father in action." Gesturing to the zebras gathered behind her, she declared, "These are the equines of bronze and iron, the craftszebras of the Ascendency. They shall be those good souls who will rebuild your city. And within a month's time, you will live in new homes. A city rebuilt in the image of pure equinity. Many of you shall join their ranks someday, and if you can become talented enough at your craft, you shall achieve enlightenment and ascend as a true spirit of equine perfection. But that is many years of practice away. For now, give thanks to the Star Father, for he is the one who has given you the chance to save your soul!"\n\nOn queue, the equines of iron and bronze began a round of thunderous applause to the speech, and the audience slowly followed. The preacher stepped away from the crowd as a masked equine of silver approached her, "You did well, Jezalla. I'll take it from here and ensure corruption is purged from the city."\n\nJezalla turned to him and nodded, "You best follow through on that Aspirant Zakob. You failed the Star Father once when you failed to kill that Avian agent. You shall not fail again." The aspirant gulped and nodded before turning to his soldiers, "Protect the equines of bronze and iron. Kill any corrupted who resist their work.""
hippone_sekrit.3.a: "At least we've got roofs over our head again."

hippone_sekrit.4.t: "A Field Of Temples and Souls"
hippone_sekrit.4.d: ""Hear me, and rejoice oh spirits of equinity! You have the privilege of being saved by the great Star Father!" Jezalla Zaalatit walked amongst a camp of tents and beds, preaching to the injured, sick, and dying. "While the avians have harmed your physical form, they can never damage your soul, that spirit that makes you an equine. A fragment of the Godhead from which we all came."\n\nStopping at the bed of one wounded zebra, Jezalla held her hoof as her leg was stitched together, her screams of pain only silenced when the nurse, and equine of bronze and iron, stuffed her mouth with a gag of willow bark and cotton. The nurse then turned to her and spoke with hushed concern, "Lady Zaalatit, this mare will not survive without alchemical treatment. But only a bit of wound-sealer would guarantee her life. Could you or one of your assistants fetch it?"\n\nJezalla scowled at the nurse, "Do not speak so casually to an equine of gold! You shall be forgiven for the care you show to your work, but do not make the same mistake twice. I shall fetch the treatment." Leaving at a canter, Jezalla approached the largest tent in the field and swept aside the entrance flap, revealing a mare in a lab coat with bright purple-dyed hair and stripes. Upon seeing her, Jezalla briefly kneeled before standing and addressing her, "I apologize, miss. I did not know you would be here. I hope I did not interrupt your work." The zebra turned around to her and handed her a bottle, "Not at all, Jezalla. I think you'll be needing this for that patient. Now run along. I have more work to do."\n\nJezalla took the bottle and began to trot back to the patient's bed, not bothering to question how the mare knew why she was there before she arrived. As she left, a hooded figure approached the tent. Entering the tent, the stallion walked up just behind the mare. Looking over, she smiled briefly and turned to face the stallion, "Ah, Grandmaster of Pleasure, have you come for some potions?" The stallion pulled back his shawl, revealing sunglasses and a gauze mask, "Unfortunately not. While I love using your concoctions for my experiments, I am here to give you a summons to Hippone. The Star Father wishes to meet with the Guide once again."\n\nThe mare straightened her back and paused for a second before responding, "Then tell him I'll be there as soon as I can. I must always answer my teacher's call."\n\nThe Grandmaster nodded and went to leave, before turning back. "Oh, bring your alchemical supplies. He has uses for them.""
hippone_sekrit.4.a: "The Guide and the Teacher together."

hippone_sekrit.5.t: "The Auspicious Government"
hippone_sekrit.5.d: "The host of the Equines of Gold stood before him at rapt attention. Before him lay a message from the Star Father himself, a sanctified missive that had been penned by his holy hoof. He was but a mere Equine of Gold himself, not quite a master, and thus it was a great honor to have been selected to proclaim these great words.\n\n"Fellow equines, rejoice!" he bellowed, his voice echoing about the amphitheater. "You have all been selected to serve the great Covenant with the dignity befitting your status. He calls you here to act in servitude to your kind, to do what you were born to do."\n\nAs he glanced about the crowd, his eyes settled on a cloaked figure surrounded by Masters of Silver. A striking purple mane was all that could be seen beneath the cloak. She was here. He knew not if the omen was auspicious.\n\n"Rejoice, I say to you!" he continued, unabated, "for you shall be sent to adulate the Star Father's great name! You will be sent to the towns, and the cities, and the hinterlands, and you shall rule in his name against the avian kind. You shall be the bastion that stands before the subtle corruption of the avian, and you will not falter. For this, the Star Father places his faith in you."\n\nWordlessly, the host of the Equines of Gold came before the speaker to receive their assignments. He looked to the crowd, but he could no longer spot the shock of purple among them."

They're all confused for a moment but they all quickly decide that it worked and that Hiram has actually managed to mantle the Godhead, transcending beyond mortality and escaping the cycle of life and rebirth that traps Equinity in the material world and giving them an entity that will be able to fight Za'al Maar in the immaterial world.

However it should be noted that due to the sheer diversity of the §rCovenant§!'s leadership, the form this new model economy shall take is still a matter of intense debate.\n\nThe first amongst these factions are the £faction_tur_kurdish §rZynskaites§! led by the Trotkatian equinepologist §rQarnaim Sikarbaalid§!. This faction takes their name from the infamous Zeblu prophet Zynskai, whom ordained that cosmopolitanism and all of its influences must actively be fought against lest the Zeblu are to be destroyed. Thus the £faction_tur_kurdish §rZynskaites§! preach a return to the arcadian lifestyle of the original Zebras, traditional guild based production, the downsizing of urban areas and most importantly of all the militarisation of every aspect of society.\n\nTheir chief rival is the £civ_factory_output §rZidonite§! faction headed by the famed §rZurite§! mathematician §rZisa Zaalatit§!. Their name is an homage to the alleged legendary founder of §YColthage§!, Queen Zido under whom the city began its meteoric rise to the forefront of Zonician politics. As the name suggests the faction is primarily based upon the principles of urban modernisation, reinforcing the §rAscendacy§!'s already existing caste system and the maximisation of the country's industrial and economic output.\n\n£faction_tur_kurdish §rZynskaite§! economic influence is: [HIE.GetAgrarianPopularity]\n£civ_factory_output §rZidonite§! economic influence is: [HIE.GetUrbanitePopularity]\n\nSetting the §YEconomic Policy§! of a state is irreversible will unlock additional §YEconomic Projects§! in said state based upon the selected policy.

### Country Leader Descriptions ###
CVA_HIRAM_ZERRANID_DESC: "§YBiography§!: Born to a rich patrician family in Hippone, Hiram Zerranid had an easy life and could focus freely on his studies. As an adult, he enrolled in the University of Colthage and studied history, philosophy, hippology and alchemy. During his time there, he began a small, secret society that would have stayed as such had the government not collapsed multiple times in quick succession.\n\nBy the end of the Second Colthaginian Civil War, Hiram's followers had grown from a small club to a legion of thousands. His teachings gave the aimless purpose and the destitute hope. Once he had gained enough support, he made the daring act of rebelling against Zarishat's regime under the pretense of her being unfit to rule. As a direct result of this, his influence skyrocketed and the knowledge of his beliefs spread throughout Colthage. To others he was no longer Hiram Zerranid, for his followers whispered a new name in reverence while his enemies cursed the title that he had come to be known by: §rThe Star Father§!.\n\nNow that the Age of Strife has begun, only time will tell what will come of this mysterious zebra and his new religion. Will he be content with brutally cleansing his homeland of the "evil" he claims infests it, or will he strive for higher, more terrifying goals?\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

The Vespers, however, are only capable of doing this for a very short period of time.\n\n§7The Vespers' incredibly toxic ingredients means that it can only be consumed by the most physically fit of equines. This does not in any manner, negate the risk of permanent infertility in the best case scenario, and complete and total organ failure in the worst, leading to an agonizing death."

hippone_aspj_flavor.1.desc: "Zateo was too small, he couldn't see past the cheering throngs between him and the rhytmic thumping that the grand parade produced. Maybe he could try further along the route? Looking around, Zateo caught a look at a tiny back alley that the crowds were avoiding. Perfect! This was his way to get farther ahead in the parade. Dashing down the alleyway, Zateo thought of what he would see. The famed equines of silver in their masks, sacrificing their individualities to serve the grand ideas of the covenant! Of course, Zateo didn't quite understand what that all meant, but he knew he should be proud of them.\n\nRounding the final corner, Zateo bounded up a small hill to exit the alley before his hoof caught on a rock jutting out the side of a building. Tripping over, Zateo came crashing down on his front right knee, scraping it badly and causing it to bleed profusely. As he tried to stand, Zateo could only wince in pain as he watched the blood seeping into the cobblestones. On the edge of tears, Zateo began to call out, "Help! Please, I'm hurt!" But no creature was around. Every loyal citizen of the Ascendency was at the parade. So the young zebra curled up and tried to apply pressure to the wound. It wouldn't be fatal, he thought, but he'd be there a while.\n\n"Well, what's this then?" Zateo turned to face the new voice. Looking from where he came, he saw a hooded zebra mare holding a satchel over her shoulder. "That looks painful. Would you like some help?" Eager to get out of the situation, Zateo nodded as the mare walked over and pulled off her hood. As she applied gauze and an alchemical tonic to his knee, all he could notice was her deep purple-colored mane.\n\n"There, all done!" she said after applying the potion. Watching the wound heal at incredible speed, Zateo could scarcely believe his eyes. "Now then, try to be more careful next time."\n\n"Wait!" Zateo called out as she went to leave, "I haven't caught your name, good miss, my father would want to know who had healed my wounds."\n\nThe mare turned back for a second, before pulling up her hood and simply saying, "No one. Just a helpful guide." And then just as quickly as she had come, the mare was gone."
hippone_aspj_flavor.1.a: "Well, thanks miss!"

hippone_aspj_flavor.2.t: "Fate of the Damned"
hippone_aspj_flavor.2.desc: ""Useless Za’al-Maar afflicted avians," the officer muttered. "Twenty-one god damn hours, and he still refuses to talk." Taking off his mask, the officer walked over to his chair in the Colthage Municipal Securities division office. The military police of the city of Colthage. Kicking a trash can by his desk over, the officer plopped himself down with a huff, and he went to the paperwork at his desk. This Avian had been found with government documents trying to flee the city. He wished from deep down inside his heart that he could just end the hippogriff's life, but orders from the top said he needed info. Shaking his head, he could still hear his partner going at it in the other room. The prisoner's wail's of pain brought him some joy, at least. If the Avian wouldn't talk, they'd just hurt him more.\n\nLooking down at his paperwork, he was shocked when he looked up to see a hooded zebra in front of him. Shooting up, he grabbed for his sidearm before he recognized the face under the hood. The purple-haired zebra.\n\n"Ah, I see you finally noticed me." She quipped. "I had hope that the city's defenders were a bit more alert."\n\nThe officer inhaled and exhaled slowly. He was in a foul mood, but now was not the time to mouth off to an equine of gold, "I apologize for my failure, miss. What brings you to our station?"\n\n"Orders from the palace of the teacher. That prisoner is to be transferred to my care immediately. My squad will be here tomorrow morning at 09.00 to pick it up." And then, as quickly as she came, she was gone.\n\nThe officer smirked and then began to chuckle. That's what that prisoner deserves! Everyone knows what happens to those who go with the purple-haired zebra! They become soulless husks of themselves before they finally meet the fate of all Avian scum. Serves him right for not answering their questions. If endless torture is a fate worse than death, then there are no words to describe her cursed embrace."

hippone_aspj_flavor.3.t: "The Guide and The Teacher"
hippone_aspj_flavor.3.desc: "Pulling back her hood and releasing her purple mane, the Guide got a better look at the door in front of her. It was simple, but she knew that the Star Father's personal lab was behind it. The equines of silver and gold which had escorted her here were instructed to leave when they were a full forty paces away. Knocking three times, the Guide took a step back, not sure of what would happen. She had met Hiram before, but not like this. This was an official summons, entirely different to what she was used to. As the door opened, the Guide was shocked, but not for the reasons she thought she might be.\n\n"Ah, my dearest Guide! Come in, come in!" Hiram smiled warmly and invited the Guide in. He was disheveled and dirty, covered in muck and stains. Hiram had converted the room into a mixture of a laboratory and a greenhouse and was tending to his plants when she arrived. "Apologies for my appearance," Hiram muttered to himself, "I must have lost track of time."\n\"My teacher, you must rest! The nation relies on you being of sound mind." the Guide managed to sputter out a few words. \n\nHiram glared at her, "Are you insinuating I am not of sound mind?" But before the Guide could even respond, Hiram waved a hoof at her and continued, "Don't worry, I know you meant it as a joke." Moving around the room, Hiram stripped himself of his gardening apron and gloves, returned to the Guide, and sat her down at a chair by his desk, looking far more official.\n\n"Now, my good Guide, I have a task for you." She nodded, "Anything you command."\n\nHiram smiled and continued, "I have a dream, a dream of alchemy on a scale never before attempted. Potions that could change the very forces of reality. All the power of the fragments of the Godhead, fractured into the races of equinity, their pure essence made manifest into concoctions, mighty weapons to smite the avian!" Hiram's voice began to peak, booming with the rhetoric of all his lectures. "I believe that these potions, all of them at once, could together form enough of the essence of the Godhead that an individual, pure of spirit and ascended in mind, body, and soul, could truly become one with the spirit realm again."\n\nHiram paused, and turned to the Guide, "Will you help me?""

hippone_jrnl_eq.1.t: "A Stroke of Fortune"
hippone_jrnl_eq.1.desc: "It was on the seventh day that the expedition party had its first stroke of fortune. One of the Equines of Silver had spotted a flash of brilliant emerald green and deep sea blue among the sooty gray that made up the landscape of this part of the dragon island. At this point, the party was anxious for any lead, as they had yet to see any dragon, large or small, on their trip thus far. Thus, they sailed to the area where the stallion had spotted the flash of color an hour prior.\n\n"We have found tracks, my lady Guide," a Master of Silver began, kneeling as he did, "headed due west along the beach, only a few hours old. It appears to be those of a juvenile dragon, separated from the rest of its kind."\n\n"Well done, commander," the Guide replied, "It appears that your legionnaires have good eyesight. Ready your troops, we'll head out at once."\n\nWith a nod, the Equine stalked off towards the ship, barking orders to resupply and be ready to march. The Guide found her eyes drawn to the sky once more, searching for the telltale sign of a dragon's passage overhead, but the sky remained mercifully clear. Even a singular adult would be too much for her small band to manage, but a juvenile? She felt her mouth split into the beginnings of a grin."
hippone_jrnl_eq.1.a: "A juvenile would be just perfect."

hippone_jrnl_misc.0.t: "Embers"
hippone_jrnl_misc.0.desc: "It had taken the better part of the day before the search party caught up with its elusive prey. It had been a simple matter to track it; the creature had made little effort to conceal its path, and the expert scouts that accompanied her made child's play of the effort. Now, a cave lay before them, with a soft glow emanating from its entrance alongside a mournful sniffling. Holding up a hoof for quiet, the Guide stalked ahead alone past the mouth of the cave into the hillside beyond.\n\nA dragon that was curled into a ball inside the cave around a small, poorly made campfire. It was unmistakably a juvenile; it was much smaller than a fully grown dragon and did not yet have a pair of wings, yet at the same time it stood about as tall as any adult zebra. A quick glance showed it to be in good shape for its age, with an excellent physique, and a pallor that spoke of good organ functionality. It was the perfect specimen.\n\nAs the Guide stalked forwards, she kicked a stray pebble on the floor, and the dragon unfurled with a shot, tears in its eyes. "H-hello?" it spoke into the darkness, a waver in its voice, "I-is anyone there? Please, I need help."\n\nThe Guide strode forwards into the light of the flames. "Do not be afraid, little one," she bade, acutely aware of the knife concealed beneath her cloak.\n\nThe dragon's tears continued unabated, and it sniffled as it struggled to speak. "Can you help me? I fell off my mama's back and got hurt, and now I'm lost. I don't know where they went and it hurts."\n\n"Yes, little one," the Guide spoke, creeping ever closer, "I will help you find your mother."\n\n"D-do you promise?" the dragon asked, a note of hope coming into its voice.\n\n"I promise," the Guide lied. She put one hoof on the dragon's shoulder, as if to bring it in for a hug, and with one swipe she brought the knife along the dragon's neck.\n\nIt was over in moments, and the sobbing subsided."

# Hjortland Expedition
hippone_jrnl_eq.2.t: "An Unexpected Angle"
hippone_jrnl_eq.2.desc: "A sudden crash and series of muttered curses snapped the Guide out of the book she was reading. She was seated at a desk in a small flat her expedition had rented for their stay in Hjortland, paging through tome after tome in an effort to track down one of the ingredients that she needed for the Teacher's potions: the tears of a Hydra. The results so far had been... frustrating, to say the least.\n\n"And what do you think that you're doing?" she snapped at the careless Equine of Silver behind her. The mare was standing over what had once been a neat pile of books, that were now strewn every which way on the floor.\n\nThe Mare snapped to a sudden attention at the scrutiny. "A-apologies, ma'am, I mean, my lady Guide. I was just thinking-"\n\n"You are of the caste of Silver, not of the caste of Gold," the Guide interrupted, "you're not supposed to think, but to be a dumb brute that will keep me safe." The Guide paused, weighing her options. She hadn't been having much luck finding any information on her own. If this mare had a good idea, that made life easier, and if she didn't, well, then she could always be sent back to Colthage for reeducation. She sighed. "Say your piece," she ordered.\n\n"Yes my lady," the Equine yelped, somehow managing to stand even straighter, "I was just thinking about the bedtime stories my ma used to tell me, about boogeymares living under the bridge, and thought that maybe any place with something as scary as a hydra might tell some stories about that?"\n\nThe Guide stood still for a moment, processing, before diving into the stack to find a book of fairy tales that she had acquired on a whim. Flipping through, she settled on a tale that took place in- "The swamp," she uttered aloud, flipping back to an almanac of Olenia. "There," she said, placing her hoof on a large, swampy area, "Karpalosuot." She smiled, her face flush with triumph, and the Equine returned the expression. "What is your name, legionnaire?" she asked."
hippone_jrnl_eq.2.a: "Elishat Zarthas, my lady."

hippone_jrnl_eq.3.t: "An Unorthodox Plan"
hippone_jrnl_eq.3.desc: "It had taken several days by hoof for the hills of the Olenian highlands to slowly make way to the marshes of Karpalosuot. The journey itself had been rather simple, but by the time that the landscape made way to fetid, stinking pools of stagnant water, everyzebra's nerves were beginning to grow thin.\n\n"It occurs to me," the Guide said, ducking underneath a low hanging branch with an undignified grunt, "that we have yet to discuss what to do when we actually reach the creature that we have been seeking."\n\n"What is there to discuss, my lady?" a Master of Silver grunted in response, "simple force of arms will force the creature into submission, whereupon we may harvest the creature for its tears at our leisure."\n\n"I worry about our band's ability to fell such a foe," the Guide replied, "the hydra is said to be a large creature, and while I don't doubt the prowess of your troops, I do worry that we simply don't have enough zebras to confront such a creature."\n\n"Why do we need to fight at all?" a voice chimed in from the rear of the formation. The Guide turned to see Elishat, the zebra who had given her the clue to locate the Hydra, was the one who had spoken up.\n\nThe Master of Silver grew incensed at the interruption. "Quiet, you!" he snapped, but the Guide cut him off.\n\n"Let her speak," bade the Guide, "Elishat, explain yourself. How do you propose to get tears from this creature without conflict?"\n\n"Well," Elishat begin, collecting her thoughts, "poetry always made me sad. Maybe we can read the hydra some sad poetry to make it cry."\n\nThe Guide ran the idea through her head. It was foolish, but it was just foolish enough to work. "Fine. Commander," she ordered, "send one of your legionnaires to find the saddest poem that they can find.""
hippone_jrnl_eq.3.a: "If this doesn't work, we'll fight."

hippone_jrnl_misc.1.t: "An Unforeseen Result"
hippone_jrnl_misc.1.desc: ""Oh, how I compare thee to a fetid breeze!" the Guide began, orating from the scroll that she held in her hooves. The Equines of Silver had returned from their expedition into town with a collection of poems that they claimed, as per the merchants they had purchased them from, would "charm the hide off of even a changeling."\n\nStill, the guide couldn't help but feel rather foolish. She was standing knee deep on the banks of a great pool of stagnant water, proclaiming poetry that wasn't even sad to nothing she could see. She could feel that this was the right place, however, and mastered any feelings of embarrassment.\n\n"Thy breath smells like a putrescent cabbage," the Guide continued, "and thine visage is compared to a slug of the sea! Thy scent may be compared to an unwashed loon, whose presence is as welcome as that of a cock at dawn!"\n\nAt once, a great rumbling overtook the area. Great limbs flew from the swamps, and a many headed hydra appeared before the Guide and the assembled party.\n\n"Oh how I love thine many heads!" the Guide spoke, unabated, as if reciting a bit of sorcery. She spoke as if at rote, "Each head more foolish than the last, and each more putrid! I can barely stand within the presence of ye, that ye are so repulsive!"\n\nThe hydra stood menacingly above the assembled host of zebras. It stood many heads above the assembled group, and it was all the Guide could do to not tremble at the sight. She took a deep breath, gathered h1er thoughts, and continued the poem. "Despite how terrible ye may be, I still wish to be with thee! I wish to adulate within thy weathered brows, and to live within thy measured gaze. For though thy may stink, and scare with abandon, thine will always be mine."\n\nThe clearing was quiet. The Guide stood still, sweating with effort, as the hydra seemed to almost consider the words. It let out a laugh, a great guffaw, and at once the swamp was alight with the great heaving laughter of the hydra that stood before them. The Guide strode forward, sensing what was about to happen, and held out a flask as a singular tear fell from the hydra's eye."

hippone_jrnl_eq.4.t: "Welcome To The Queendom"
hippone_jrnl_eq.4.desc_1: "The changeling hive city of Ditrysium stank. It was the first thing that the Guide noticed as she stepped off the ship onto the bustling docks of the port city; the brine in the air from the ocean mingled poorly with the smog emanating from within the depths of the hive. Trying not to gag, she quickly unscrewed a potion from her belt, the scent of the poultice blocking out the rest. The guide turned to Elishat, herself walking down to the docks, but the fellow zebra paid no heed, instead scanning the city for any signs of threat. "I do not like this place, my lady Guide," she said, "are we sure these changelings can be trusted?"\n\n"General Cardo is a respected associate of the Teacher," the Guide admonished, "and changelings themselves are equine."\n\n"Equine or not, there's something wrong with this place, something that I can't quite put my hoof on," Elishat responded, "I don't trust it."\n\n"You worry too much," the Guide chided gently, a smile in her voice. She expected little difficulty in finding the next two items that the Teacher had requested, especially with the promised help of such a decorated general as Lacin Cardo himself.\n\nThe changeling in question stood at the head of the docks, flanked by soldiers of his own. "It is with great honor that I welcome you and your party to the Changeling Lands, Lady Guide," he said, his face inscrutable.\n\nThe Guide gave a slight smile in response to the address. "Please, the honor is mine. We have traveled far to be here, and are eager to begin our journey."\n\nThe general nodded. "In due time, my lady. For now, why don't you and your companions rest?" He gestured to his soldiers, who began to march down the docks. "My changelings here will show your soldiers to their quarters. In the meanwhile, why don't you and I explore the Hive? I'm sure that your Star Father has much to gain from a more formal partnership with the queendom."\n\nThe Guide tried to hide a grimace. More time in this smelly hive? She supposed she could bear it for a while. They had been on that ship for a long time after all."

hippone_jrnl_eq.5.desc_1: ""Is something troubling you, Elishat?" the Guide asked, her voice low so as to not be overheard. The zebra had been uncharacteristically quiet in the handful of weeks it had taken them to reach the shores of Key Lake. At first, the Guide had felt almost insulted at getting the cold shoulder, and wanted to wait for her companion to make the first move. Now, however, the Guide simply wanted her Elishat back.\n\nElishat, for her part, looked surprised at being addressed. "Nothing troubles me, my lady Guide," she responded. Elishat paused, almost a half second too long, and the Guide frowned slightly. "Why, do you sense something wrong?"\n\n"No, I just-" the Guide stammered, trying to find the words. "Is this about the changelings? I know you didn't trust them, are you upset with me for allying with them?"\n\nElishat blinked. "No, my lady," she responded, "I could never be angry with you. And you were right to trust the changelings, they have been nothing but helpful so far."\n\nThe Guide sighed. General Cardo and his entourage had been rather useful, she could admit, but she found herself starting to agree with Elishat's original mistrust. Something seemed incredibly wrong, and she couldn't put her hoof on it.\n\nElishat coughed. "Will that be all, my lady?"\n\n"What?" the Guide asked, startled out of her recollection, "I- yes, that will be all."\n\nElishat nodded, falling silently behind to the rear of the column. General Cardo called out from ahead. "My lady Guide," he shouted, his voice carrying across the snowbanks, "we have arrived."\n\nNodding, the Guide trotted forward, unhooking a flask from her belt and silently scooping some water out of the lake. At least she was almost done."

"Is that-"\n\n"The husk of the First Queen," the Guide confirmed.

"What are you doing?" he demanded, shooting back to his hooves.\n\nThe Guide stopped, knife in hoof. "I require but a sample of the First Queen. I will be quick."\n\nGeneral Cardo stared silently. "I cannot let you do that," he said, and made a gesture in the air."

This sort of trouble is exactly why this was necessary." Cardo shook his head in disgust. "You've seen too much; you cannot be allowed to live." He nodded to the host of changelings before him. "Take her."\n\nWith a cry of anguish, the Guide threw her knife, impacting the forehead of the nearest changeling. She grabbed two potions from her belt and threw them before diving into the nearest snowbank. The first exploded, transmuting the flesh of the changelings unfortunate enough to be caught in the blast into crystal. The second fell into another crowd of changelings, simply immolating them in a torrent of alchemical fire.\n\nIgnoring the screams around her, the Guide charged forwards, retrieving her knife and throwing a smokescreen potion into the snow. She grabbed another potion and threw it, finding no satisfaction in the screams of melting changeling flesh.\n\nShe screamed as she raced through the fog, stopping in front of Elishat's face.\n\nShe hesitated for a mere moment.

# Manehattan expedition
hippone_jrnl_eq.7.t: "Welcome to the Big Apple"
hippone_jrnl_eq.7.desc: "The sprawl of the city that lay before her was unlike anything the Guide had ever seen before.\n\nThe port city of Manehattan had been selected as the perfect point of entry into the sprawling Equestrian nation. It was a huge metropolitan city, and while the thought of being in such close proximity to avians disgusted her, she could admit that the multiracial makeup of the city would make it easy for a lone zebra to blend in.\n\nShe had booked passage on a container ship destined for the metropolis, opting to travel separately from her expeditionary party so as to avoid any suspicion. As the ship sailed past the Statue of Friendship, she could barely contain her sense of awe at the skyline that seemed to stretch for miles. Giant towers of steel and glass like she had never seen before seemed to reach into the sky as in supplication to the gods above. It was impressive, somewhat intimidating sight, and for once, the Guide found herself feeling rather small.\n\nA small patrol boat led the Guide’s ship into port, docking at an otherwise unoccupied pier. Disembarking with a word of thanks to the captain, she trotted up the dock towards a mercifully small line in front of a small checkpoint, a small sign hung above it labled simply "Customs."\n\nAt the head of the line was a stallion, equine, thankfully, wearing an easygoing smile. "Hey, how’s it goin?" he asked, his accent strange to the Guide’s ears. He ripped a page off the pad of paper in front of him. "Name?"\n\n"You may refer to me as the Guide."\n\nThe stallion’s smile didn’t fade, but it seemed to freeze on his face as he gave her a long, discerning look. "Okay," he said, drawing out the end of the word, "and what brings you to Manehattan today miss Guide?"\n\n"Business, of a sort," she responded, ignoring the look on the stallion’s face, "I’m meeting a friend of mine here."\n\n"Well, let me be the first to welcome you to our great city," the stallion said, passing her a signed slip of paper."

hippone_jrnl_misc.3.desc: "The safehouse was located in Bronclyn, one of Manehattan's outer boroughs. Compared to the bright lights and bustle of the city proper, Bronclyn was more down to earth: not subdued, per say, but more modest.\n\nThe particular neighborhood that the Guide found herself in seemed to be populated entirely by thestrals, the bat-ponies out and about despite the late hour. The safehouse itself was a modest building, some five stories high. The other members of the expedition party had gathered here at the behest of their benefactor, a certain thestral by the name of Starry Glory.\n\nThe thestral in question sat alone with the Guide in a small sitting room at the top floor of the safehouse. The two had been deliberating for the better part of an hour, and it seemed as if the thestral had finally come to some kind of conclusion.\n\n"Bales," Starry said, placing a hoof onto the map sitting on the table in front of them. "It's got the greatest libraries in Equestria, if not the world. If you can't find information on what you're looking for there, then the information just doesn't exist."\n\nThe Guide strode over, humming as she went. "Perusing through so many tomes might be more difficult than you think, especially searching without aim. I must confess that I am unfamiliar with how you Equestrians categorize information."\n\nThe thestral waved off any concerns. "Don't worry about that, I have a buddy who works as a librarian there, one of the few thestrals to hold the position," he said with a note of pride, "He'd be more than willing to help us out."\n\n"I guess that's settled, then," the Guide said, rising to her hooves."

hippone_jrnl_eq.8.t: "In the City of Wisdom"
hippone_jrnl_eq.8.desc: "The many libraries of Bales had been as useful as Starry Glory had suggested.\n\nThe Guide found herself surrounded by piles of books, as various equines of all shapes and sizes constantly added and removed from the stack with a frightening pace. It was as if she was serviced by an entire army of Equines of Gold; she knew that she would always think fondly of this place.\n\nHer time among the stacks had been incredibly useful thus far, and she had located just about everything that she needed to find. Parasprites would be easy to find, as they were everywhere in Equus, but it was mentioned that a particularly large concentration of them could be found in the sleepy town of Hollow Shades.\n\nThe Dust of Starfall, on the other hand, would be harder to find. The tomes that she had read mentioned the city of Stalliongrad, a city that the Guide was not particularly eager to visit. Stalliongrad was the city of the crypto-avian marksists, equines who had fully surrendered to the foul influence of Za'al-Maar. She shuddered at the thought. She would visit, of course, as the Teacher demanded, but she'd be lying if she said that she was anticipating the trip with any particular gladness.\n\nAnother location that came up frequently in her search was the small village of Ponyville. It sat on the Everfree forest, a woodland known for its abundance of alchemical reagents. It was also supposed to be incredibly frightening, though the Guide doubted that she would be so easily rattled as the average pony.\n\nThe Guide shut the book in front of her, letting out a long sigh. Ponyville and the Everfree forest would have to wait until the end of her trip. Now, the choice of destination lay before her."

hippone_jrnl_eq.13.t: "Free Passage Through a Red Land"
hippone_jrnl_eq.13.desc: "When the Guide had first passed the border separating Equestria and Stalliongrad, she had expected to feel something. Stalliongrad was the greatest stronghold of crypto-avian marksism on Equus, if not the world. Za'al-Maar's influence should have been invested heavily here, yet the Guide could sense nothing.\n\nPerhaps the influence of the great enemy was more subtle than she had anticipated.\n\nNevertheless, the Guide, alongside Starry Glory and the rest of her entourage, had been traveling north along the coastline for about a week. They had been trotting in the direction of a small village that had been mentioned several times in the tomes from Bales. When they finally arrived, they had managed to speak to one of the braver ponies residing there, a mare who introduced herself as Salty Breeze.\n\n"Yes, I know what it is that you are seeking," she said, speaking in between a stalk of barley. The Guide had been hailed by the mare when they were a small ways away outside of the village, curious as to why such a motley crew had come so far out into the middle of nowhere. When they had mentioned what they were after, her cheerful expression had grown somber. "It was a little over three months ago. Some of the local boys were out fishing, and they heard a big boom. Something struck a small island nearby, just a few miles off the coast there, and a tidal wave from the impact knocked their skiff over. Two of them, they didn’t make it back," she said. The mare hung her head low, giving a small sigh. "The rest of the boys say the island’s different now, cursed. They have also seen some strange boats around the area" At this, a look of genuine concern entered the pony’s face. "If you all are going out there, you must be careful, yes? No telling what might happen."\n\nThe Guide was shocked at the level of compassion that Salty Breeze had shown them. This was somepony who had willingly given themselves over to the enemy? She shook her head. It wasn’t important. They had their destination, and that was all that mattered."
hippone_jrnl_eq.13.a: "We'll be careful."

hippone_jrnl_misc.7.t: "The Tainted Isle"
hippone_jrnl_misc.7.desc: "The island lay completely still.\n\nGone was the song of the crickets that had been ever present on the mainland. The whisper of wind through the trees was absent, replaced only by the last gasp of a dying mare. Even the sound of the crashing of the waves grew silent as the party drew their anchors and landed on the island's shores, and all that remained was the sound of soft breathing, and the beating of the Guide's heart.\n\nIt grew obvious to the Guide that a great magical calamity had fallen upon the tiny islet, likely during the starfall that had brought them here. The land itself had seemed to take on an alien appearance. The grass lay flat on the ground, each blade seeming to point away from the epicenter of the fall. The trees grew at unusual angles, the branches forming fractal patterns of the trunks that they sprang from. The Guide could see no signs of any wildlife; there were no tracks, no droppings, not even a leaf out of place.\n\n"Well this is suitably ominous," Starry Glory quipped, a smirk on his face.\n\n"Quiet," the Guide snapped, "we do not have time for foolishness. The sooner that we get the Dust of Starfall, the sooner we can leave."\n\nOrdering two of her Equines of Silver to remain behind to guard the ship, she took the rest of the party towards the center of the island.\n\nThe closer that the party got to the center, however, the stranger the island seemed to become. The paths they took seemed to wander, and anypony who left sight of the main group often found themselves away from where they thought they were. The grass began to shimmer in the night sky, and the water collecting in the pools took on magical hues, inviting those who looked to peer closer into their depths.\n\nEventually, the Guide and her party reached the center of the island. The fallen star lay in a large crater, glowing faintly in the stillness of the night. Starry stepped forwards, but the Guide lay her hoof across his chest, her eyes widening."
hippone_jrnl_misc.7.a: "An Ursa Major lay sleeping around the star."

hippone_jrnl_misc.8.t: "The Fallen Star"
hippone_jrnl_misc.8.desc: ""Well now that is a problem," Starry Glory whispered, staring at the Ursa Major that lay sleeping below. He glanced to the Guide. "So? What do you think, do you have any voodoo magic to take that thing down?"\n\nThe Guide grimaced. "My potions may be powerful, but they're certainly not enough to take down an Ursa Major. No, the best thing to do is to sneak around it and collect the Dust of Starfall without waking the beast." She hummed, thinking for a moment, and turned fully to the thestral standing beside her. "I need you to fly me down there."\n\n"What?" Starry yelped. He gulped, glancing back down to the Ursa Major, still sleeping, thankfully, and continued in a more quiet tone. "Are you crazy? I can't carry you down there, you're too heavy." The Guide gave him a look, and the thestral looked away, stammering, "I mean, just-" he took a breath, "Why don't I just fly down there and grab it myself?"\n\n"You don't know what to get," the Guide said. Unspoken was the assertion that she simply didn't trust him. "It has to be me."\n\nGrimacing, the Thestral grabbed the guide under her hooves, and the Guide pretended to ignore the comments about her weight. The two flew into the pit, hovering over the rock, and the Guide collected a few motes of dust emanating from the star. Silently, she held the flask up to the thestral, who took it as his cue to leave. As he began to fly away, however, a strong wind blew through the pit, and the thestral lost his grip, dropping the Guide onto the head of the gargantuan monster.\n\nTumbling off the beast's snout, the Guide impacted the ground with a huff. Holding her breath, she could only watch as the great beast's eyes slowly opened, staring directly at her.\n\n"Run," she whispered.\n\nShe shot to her feet and scrambled out of the pit as quickly as her hooves would take her. "Run!" she shouted to the assembled equines. Not caring if they followed her or not, she glanced behind her as the creature stood to its full height, blotting out the moon. It let out a roar that shook the foundations of the very earth.\n\nThe Guide turned back. Racing down to where the ship had docked, she saw that the two zebras she had left behind had already begun to weigh the anchor, and was pulling out slowly. She took a running leap onto the boat and promptly collapsed, breathing heavily at the exertion. Starry Glory landed next to her, and she turned to him."

She glanced at the Equine of Silver who had awoken her. Zethro was relatively short and softspoken, but he had proven himself more than capable on multiple occasions during the rise of the Ascendancy. The real reason that she had brought him, however, was that he had spent several years of his life traveling all around Griffonia before settling down in Hippone.\n\nWithout another word, the two zebras ascended to the boat's deck and took in the scenery of Seguro, a flourishing city on the coast of [413.owner.GetNameDef]. Ships were docking and departing all around them while large crowds of different creatures mingled with one another.\n\n"It's quite different from back home," mused Zethro before turning to face the Guide, "I'm not proud of my history here, but I hope that my knowledge of Griffonia will be of use to you."\n\n"Yes..." The Guide didn't meet his gaze, having noticed something that was setting off alarms in her head. Though the stain of the avian was not overwhelming here, she could spot a few griffons throughout the port. What had really grabbed her attention was a blasphemous sight: a griffon and a zebra were embracing one another, then closed their faces together as if they were...\n\n"I will be right back." Before Zethro could ask what she was doing, the Guide had already entered the midst of the crowd."

The two seemed to notice her as she got closer, though that did not slow her advance.\n\nThe griffon initially wore an expression of worry, then it turned into concern as he addressed the stranger storming towards him. "Are you all right? Can we help-" His words were cut off by a swift movement that saw a dagger now protruding from his throat. He gurgled and weakly reached for the blade, then collapsed. The zebra beside him gasped, not able to speak from the shocking event she just witnessed.\n\nThe Guide pressed the blade down to ensure the griffon's death. "Such filth has no place in this world. Oh ye who have poisoned the equine, I grant thee the fate you deserve." She retrieved the blade and turned towards the dead griffon's lover, "And you shall join him for rejecting your equinity!"\n\nThe other zebra screamed briefly before her life too came to an end. The crowd began to panic as they saw the murders. The Guide stood motionless, enjoying the righteous feeling of slaying the unclean. Just as some security had begun to take notice, Zethro arrived to usher the Guide away. "There will be time for killing avians later, we can't afford to cause scenes like this! We have to go!"\n\nThe Guide whipped her knife towards Zethro in anger, preparing to scold him for suggesting that she should have spared the griffon. However, she spotted what looked like the local authorities heading towards the two of them and thought better of it. She quickly put her knife away and nodded. "Very well. Let us make haste.""

hippone_jrnl_gr.2.desc: "The journey took the two zebras north through the mountains of Barrad. Though the harsh and sudden climate shifts were loathsome at best and hazardous at worse, their tenacity and willpower saw them through. After all, Zethro had assured the Guide that her first destination was worth any sacrifice to see at least once.\n\nAnd see it they did. Inside the land of Pònaidhean at the bottom of a narrow valley was a breathtaking sight: the city of Dail Mhòr, which was a radical departure from anything that the Guide had seen up to this point. Gone was all semblance of modern civilization, instead replaced largely by vast, extravagant monasteries and temples that stretched into the valley as far as the eye could see.\n\nZethro broke the awe-stricken silence. "The monks of this land are practiced in all sorts of arts, both physical and mystical. They live in harmony with each other and the wildlife, including the miniscule Breezies." He paused, seeming to hesitate, "That is why we're here, right? The Breezies?"\n\nAs the Guide opened her mouth to answer, she noticed a small group of floating critters not too far away. She smiled, "That's correct. Would those happen to be Breezies over there?"\n\nZethro squinted his eyes, then nodded, "Yes, though I would recommend caution. They can be troublesome if provoked."\n\n"Then I'll be quick." The Guide started off towards the Breezies, taking care to tread lightly so as to not draw too much attention to herself. She drew her knife, intending to quickly perform the deed, when... wait...\n\nShe had gotten close enough that she could see the Breezies clearly. Truthfully, she had never seen one before, but she knew that the Teacher required the wings of the creatures in front of her. What gave her pause was how... equine-like they were. These couldn't have been Cosmic Mistakes, they bore the shape of tiny, floating ponies.\n\nAfter a moment's hesitation, the Guide readied her knife, took a deep breath, and steeled herself."

He sat down next to a tree, making himself comfortable.\n\n"Perhaps after this is done, I could introduce you to him as thanks for your help so far."\n\n"I... that would be an honor."\n\nThe two had settled down next to a river north of the city of Ivanhorn. The territories of Wittenland were a treat to wander through, with many a talented pony showing the two travelers the wonders of Wittenlandic traditions. The best part was the local food, which was simply heavenly.\n\nHowever, their mission remained.

So rare were the creatures that there were naught more than a few dozen confirmed sightings of them in recorded history... at least in the wild.\n\nAfter the fourth day of searching, exhaustion began to set in for Zethro, causing him to trip. "Maybe... maybe we'd be better off trying to find one in a- *cough* -a zoo somewhere?"\n\nThe Guide stopped to help Zethro get back on his hooves, "The phoenix is here, I know it. We have to keep searching." After patting him on the back, Zethro weakly nodded and continued searching with her.\n\nAfter a few more hours of fruitless searching, Zethro collapsed from heat exhaustion. The Guide rushed to his aid, cursing herself for pushing him too hard. She retrieved some water and carefully poured it down his throat, when suddenly...\n\nA bright, orange-red feather slowly fell in front of her, gently landing on top of Zethro's chest. As soon as it touched him, she felt a chilling warmth flow through him. Zethro's eyes shot open and he stood up as if he was perfectly healthy. "Woah!" he shouted, "What was that?! I feel amazing!"\n\nThe Guide sat speechless. She picked up the feather, then looked to the sky in hopes of finding where it came from. She caught a glimpse of something crimson flying behind the mountainside."

Said squad had explained that Westerly was preoccupied with happenings back in Jezeragrad and was unable to leave, so he sent one of his trusted spec-ops teams to assist "his favorite foreigner's student" with whatever she needed.\n\nAfter getting introductions and the mission briefing out of the way, the squad of eight ponies accompanied the Guide and Zethro to a rumored nesting location of the mythical phoenix. So rare were the creatures that there were naught more than a few dozen confirmed sightings of them in recorded history... at least in the wild.\n\nSoon enough, they arrived at a promising area. They settled into various hidden vantage points and began to wait, hoping that their intel was correct.\n\nAs the hours passed, some of them began to make hushed small talk with one another. One of the armed ponies turned to the Guide and whispered, "What do you need a phoenix feather for anyways?"\n\n"It is for the Teacher. He is working on a grand project, and I am gathering its vital components."\n\nThe pony turned his head, curious. "What sort of project?"\n\nThe Guide considered explaining the basics of the Ascendancy to the pony, but opted not to on account of how many other questions it would lead to. "Even I don't know what it is. But I trust him to right the wrongs in this world."\n\nBANG!\n\nA gunshot echoed throughout the mountains. The Guide saw a crimson-orange being plummet from the sky, feathers scattering everywhere. Just before it hit the ground, it ignited into flames. With a glorious screech, the phoenix stretched its wings out of the fire and corrected its fall, rising to fly once more into the sky."

However, Zethro paused to take another look around the place. The longer he looked, the more perplexed he became.

He and the 'Reformisten' he served began to implement several harsh policies towards ponies. It came to be known as the Longswordian Genocide, as Dusktalon sought nothing less than the total extermination of ponykind.\n\n"My family and I, along with hundreds of other ponies were brought to a concentration camp.

I'm telling a story!" He paused, waiting for the Guide to respond. When she didn't, he continued. "As I was saying, we would have all been shot, but then a miracle happened: one of the Reformisten officers conspired to save us. No, don't open your mouths until I am done!\n\n"Her name was Raga Andris. She was rather not much older than you, young mare, and she was a very promising soldier in the Reformisten. Raga was well on her way to becoming a general when she was assigned to carry out the latest batch of executions. She oversaw our camp, and when the time came to line us up against the wall, she stopped. For a solid minute, we waited there, wondering what our fate would be. She stared directly at me and my family, who by the grace of Varėnė had kept us together to this point. Raga then suddenly ordered the other Reformisten griffons to leave, claiming that she wanted to do the deed herself.""

The innkeeper opened the desk and retrieved a photograph, offering it to Zethro and the Guide. The Guide took the photo. It depicted a young griffon and pony hugging one another. "I also found out that she used to be a close friend of my late son before she joined the Reformisten. Even though she made many terrible choices in life, in the end she chose to be a hero."\n\nThe Guide stared at the photo. This didn't make any sense. The creatures of Za'al-Maar aren't like this. It wasn't possible for them to be so selfless. There had to be something else, another factor. The stallion must have been lying...but he wasn't, she could tell. Her hooves shook. The story and photo were a maddening contradiction to everything she believed in. There wasn't-\n\n"You can keep the photo."\n\nThe Guide froze. Her eyes darted to the innkeeper, who simply smiled at her. Zethro sensed the tense atmosphere and quietly excused himself to go to sleep. After he hurried up the stairs, the innkeeper continued, "You have a lot of pain in your life. You look like the type that hides that pain by pretending to be powerful, by hurting those who disagree with you, but let me tell you: Real power is when you have every justification to kill, and you don't."

He wondered about his own past, and considered the possibility that... no, he didn't want to think about it. Best to focus on the task at hoof.\n\nThe chirping of birds and the wildlife were eerily absent as they entered the Eygsic Forest. The gigantic winding trees curved into one another, forming an ominous covering that let only tiny amounts of light through. They were forced to use lanterns to see where they were going. Zethro found that he was having trouble keeping up with the Guide. Just before she left his field of view, he called out to her. "Wait! Don't you know what's in here?"\n\nThe Guide halted in her stride, then broke her long silence, "The next ingredient. It's ahead, I can feel it."\n\n"That's precisely why we need to be careful! The Eygsic Spiders are terrifyingly fierce, and you're going after the silk of one of their Queens!

If you keep up, they won't bother you either."\n\n"How do you know that?!" said Zethro as he rapidly looked around, his fear of spiders setting in. Instead of answering, The Guide headed deeper into the forest. Zethro struggled after her, trying desperately not to lose sight of the Guide. Not too long after, he noticed that the trees they were passing had silk on them. He made the mistake of looking up, only to see dozens, perhaps hundreds of giant spiders crawling around on webs and tree branches above them. Though he was petrified to the bone, he didn't dare stop moving.\n\nThe Guide briefly paused at a small clearing, where a grand web was spun in front of her. It was taller than any building she'd ever seen, and in the center of it laid a behemoth of a spider surrounded by countless eggs. It sat perfectly still, watching her every move. The Guide approached a small section of the silky web and quickly cut off a part of it, then turned to leave as calmly as she entered."

The two zebras explained where they needed to go next, and plans were drawn up for how to obtain the next ingredient: the silk of an Eygsic Spider Queen.\n\nThe journey to the Eygsic Forest was a quiet one. Zethro could tell that the Guide was bothered by what the Innkeeper had said to her, but she refused to talk about it. He wondered about his own past, and considered the possibility that... no, he didn't want to think about it. Best to focus on the task at hoof.\n\nThe chirping of birds and the wildlife were eerily absent as they entered the Eygsic Forest. The gigantic winding trees curved into one another, forming an ominous covering that let only tiny amounts of light through. They were forced to use lanterns to see where they were going. Despite the professional attitude of the spec-ops team, the fact that they kept their weapons raised betrayed their unease.\n\nA sudden motion to their in the foilage halted the group's movement. The spec-ops team swiveled their weapons towards it, though they did not fire. The Guide leaned towards Zethro and whispered into his ear, "When I give the signal, follow me."\n\nZethro didn't know what the signal was meant to be, but he nodded anyways. After the forest became silent once more, the group continued onwards. Zethro made the mistake of looking up, only to see dozens, perhaps hundreds of gigantic spiders crawling around on webs and tree branches above them. The Guide yanked his head down and quietly told him to remember what she said.\n\nThe group stopped at a small clearing, where a grand web was spun in front of them. It was taller than any building the Guide had ever seen, and in the center of it laid a behemoth of a spider surrounded by countless eggs. It sat perfectly still, watching their every move.\n\nSuddenly, a gunshot rang out as one of the spec-ops members fired at a nearby spider that got too close for their liking. What followed was utter horror as numberless spiders began to descend upon the team. The Guide pulled Zethro away and began to run towards the Spider Queen's web. The spec-ops team unloaded their weapons into horde of spiders, but with every one they felled, dozens more appeared from the darkness.\n\nBy the time the Guide reached the bottom of the web, the gunfire had stopped. With a terrified Zethro in tow, she quickly cut off a piece of the silky web and turned to leave, making sure to move slowly and calmly through the masses of spiders."

hippone_jrnl_gr.5.desc: "Within a large, rocky outcropping near the northern shoreline of Ptérngapolas sat two zebras laying in wait. They'd been hiding there for several hours in hopes of spotting... something. The Guide didn't know exactly what she was looking for, but the Guidance drew her to this place. And the Guidance had never failed her.\n\n"I just don't understand, how is that you are so certain that we need something not on the list? And why would it be here? There's nothing but shoreline and rocks. And crabs. I hate crabs."\n\nShe hushed Zethro, "Quiet. We need to be patient. I just... have a feeling. It's hard to explain."\n\nZethro briefly opened his mouth to protest, but said nothing. They continued to wait for some time. Eventually, the angle of the sun began to shine in Zethro's eyes, which caused him to shift around for a less-blinding position. The Guide hissed at him again and told him to be still, no matter what.\n\nNot a few moments later, they began to hear the flapping of wings from behind them. The Guide and Zethro ever so slightly turned their heads to see part of an absolutely gargantuan bird land on top of the outcropping that they had only partially ascended. Still, the two sat quietly, making no noise and no sudden movements.\n\nAs time passed and the sun set, the bird seemed to fall asleep. The Guide procured a small vial from her pouch and lightly kicked Zethro. "We need one of its feathers. I'll pluck one, you hold this chemical up to its beak. It should put the creature to sleep if it wakes up."\n\nHaving been saved by the Guide on multiple occasions now, Zethro knew better than to question her. The two zebras quietly climbed up the rest of the outcropping to get to the giant bird. Upon reaching the top, they saw the creature for what it was: a roc. The Guide made her way to the roc's wing while Zethro crawled up to its beak. The fact that the beak was almost as large as him didn't do his nerves any favours.\n\nThe two looked at one another and nodded. Zethro held the vial up and silently prayed while the Guide plucked a feather from its wing. The roc's eyes shot open briefly, freezing Zethro in fear, but then they slowly closed again. The two slowly backed away, making off with another ingredient for the Star Father's superproject."

hippone_jrnl_gr.6.desc_1: ""Welcome aboard!" cheered the stubby changeling as she helped her passengers step onto her rather cramped ship. The Guide and Zethro set their bags down, then silently agreed with one another to never cheap out on chartering a boat again. The changeling either didn't notice or pretended not to, for she happily hummed a tune while preparing her trusted dinghy for the voyage ahead.\n\nWithout thinking, Zethro blurted out, "You seem awfully friendly compared to most changelings."\n\nThe Guide immediately scowled at his rude comment. Changelings were just as equine as Zebras; they deserved the same treatment.\n\nThe changeling didn't seem bothered at all. "Oh, I get that a lot! Don't worry, I'm not gonna 'suck you dry' or anything. It's just how I am. Though trade has been really rough ever since what happened back in Blosmport... Oh! Sorry! I tend to get caught up with the past. Anyways, you're both going to the port at Blackwater, right?"\n\n"Yes," answered the Guide. Then after a moment's thought, she added, "Actually, could you take us to the northern pony lands? Around the Dread Peninsula, to Everfrost? We could quickly pick up what we need there, then take your boat back. We'd cover any additional expenses, of course."\n\nThe changeling's smile disappeared as she shook her head. "Sorry, I maintain a strict no-go policy to the waters around there. The Dead Sea is filled to the brim with all sorts of nasties, and my ship isn't big enough to ignore them. The furthest I can go is Blackwater." Just as quickly as her smile had vanished, it was back again with even more splendor. "Don't worry though, it's really pretty this time of year!"\n\n"Blackwater it is, then."\n\nAs the ship set off, the Guide and Zethro looked over their map. They only had three places left to visit, but all of them were quite far away. Zethro scratched his muzzle, "The next item should be in the Hillpony lands. After that, we'll need to make a harrowing trek into the Whitetail Mountains, then to the frozen lands north of that.""

hippone_jrnl_misc_gr.6.t: "The Hidden Spring"
hippone_jrnl_misc_gr.6.desc: "It didn't take the Guide long to figure out that the "holy water" she needed wasn't in Blackwater or anywhere around it. The locals were both extremely helpful and vague when questioned about where she could find some. After connecting several explanations together, she and Zethro deduced that mystical liquid they seeked laid in the "water forests" to the west.\n\nThe journey there was uneventful, almost ominously so. It seemed like every hour the landscape transformed more and more from the usual tiaga into something truly alien. They began to have difficulty traversing the almost dreamlike maze of ancient trees, streams, and rivers that broke apart into tiny, narrow waterways. Giant mushrooms appeared from every new corner that weaved into the seemingly endless forest canopy. Chirps and other noises from typical woodland critters were replaced by unfamilar crackles and hisses.\n\nWith some difficulty they managed to locate the source of the streams: a tranquil spring from which the water flowed out of with nothing flowing in to replenish it. "This is it," said the Guide as she pulled out a flask from her pouch. She reached down and scooped some of the crystal clear, but otherwise mundane-looking water into the flask and sealed it shut.\n\nZethro sighed in relief. "That was... surprisingly easy. Hopefully the next few will also be free of proble-"\n\n"You are not welcome here."\n\nThe Guide and Zethro whipped themselves around towards the sudden, somber voice. The Guide instinctively readied her knife, as she knew that anyone who could actually sneak up on her usually didn't have good intentions.\n\nThe hooded mare behind them remained composed despite the intruders' hostile stance. She turned her head, glancing towards the path that the zebras had entered from. "You have defiled God's holy place. Your intentions are impure, though we cannot stop you without enough bloodshed that our victory would be pyrrhic. Leave before you pollute our home any further."\n\nThe Guide and Zethro briefly looked at each other. Zethro shrugged, then the Guide turned to the mare and bowed in an attempt to apologize. "We apologize for the intrusion. We will depart at once.""
hippone_jrnl_misc_gr.6.a: "The mare's face briefly contorted into anger, but she did not stop them as they left."

hippone_jrnl_gr.7.t: "The Terror of Whitetail"
hippone_jrnl_gr.7.desc: "The treacherous peaks of Whitetail did not earn their name for nothing. Every day was met with challenging terrain, remnants of bandits, and dangerous creatures that threatened their expedition. Fortunately, none of these proved too difficult to overcome.\n\nJust as they finished killing another avian that had tried to rob them, Zethro began to come down with an illness. The Guide helped him to a nearby cave where they took shelter for the remainder of the day while she administered potions to him. Despite her expert knowledge of medicine, he did not seem to recover. She scowled, surmising that he must have caught something not covered by her repertoire of exilers.\n\nSuddenly, she heard a menacing growl pierce the muted howl of the mountain's wind. She turned to the cavern's entrance to see a fearsome, winged boar slowly advancing towards her. She glanced back to Zethro, whose fever had made him unresponsive. What luck she had, finding exactly what she needed at the worst possible time.\n\nThe Guide readied her knife and surprised the boar by charging towards it. The boar charged back, but it did not expect her to jump over it while angling the knife to cut its head and back open as she passed through the air. The boar collapsed to the ground, and the Guide returned to finish it off. With practiced finesse, she severed the tusk of the boar and placed it into her pouch before returning to Zethro.\n\nShe spent the rest of the day trying to heal him to no avail. His illness seemed to only get worse, though he did have brief moments of consciousness here and there. During one such moment, he asked her to get a "medical Equine of Gold", seeming to forget exactly where he was, but he seemed to pass out again just as quickly.\n\nThe Guide weighed her options. She could go back to the ponies of that odd village... no, they probably wouldn't help her considering how they had reacted to the two of them. She could continue on the journey and hope that the northern ponies had a remedy. Or... she could go with the unthinkable option: the avians in Whitetail were both close by and might have experience with this illness themselves. She looked at her shaking hooves as she saw her friend struggling to cling to life in front of her."
hippone_jrnl_gr.7.a: "She fed him more potions, picked him up, then began to head northwest to the tribal ponies."

hippone_jrnl_gr.8.t: "At Death's Door"
hippone_jrnl_gr.8.desc: "As their journey continued into the arctic north, Zethro's situation grew more and more dire. The plethora of potions that the Guide had been giving him only seemed to keep him moderately stable. The tips of his hooves began to turn purple, though whether that was from the disease or from frostbite, she wasn't sure. She didn't have time to check, especially since the calm tundra had given way to a fearsome blizzard. She even had to down the last of her heating potions just to warm herself enough to keep going.\n\nShe paused to check her compass, only to find that it wasn't there. She turned around hoping to find it in the snow nearby, but the blizzard was too fierce; she could barely see the ends of her hooves as it was. She whipped her heard around, looking for something, anything to use as a landmark, but there was only a pure white void in every direction.\n\nAs loathe as she was to use the Guidance this way, she needed help here. The Guide closed her eyes and focused. She felt drawn to an odd direction, and so she followed the will of the ever-present Guidance. When she opened her eyes again, she found herself at the mouth of a modest cavern. Not particularly deep, but it offered some shelter from the elements. She entered it and carefully set Zethro down, then threw her cloak over him in a feeble attempt to keep him warm.\n\nZethro began to cough again. The Guide unloaded her bags and took stock of her medical supplies, only to be faced with the grim reality of her situation: she did not have the means to save him. Not without help. Not without...\n\nA realization clicked in her mind. The final ingredient she had yet to find. The "Hammer of the Thunder Bear" was a legendary artifact said to instill strength and the will to survive into whoever held it. If she could find it, then it just might be able to save him long enough for her to get more medical supplies.\n\nShe quickly turned leave the cavern, but then a weak voice halted her hooves. "M-mom?" The Guide turned around. Zethro was immobile, his eyes closed. His breathing was ragged, and it would seem that he had become delirious as well. "It's s-so d-dark... please d-don't go..."\n\nShe cursed it all. She cursed Za'al-Maar, she cursed his creations, she cursed this forsaken continent and every hardship they had endured for the Teacher. She cursed this maddening illness that she could not cure, and she cursed herself for not bringing a wider variety of potions.\n\nThe Guide stared at her dying friend. The chances of the final ingredient being able to save him were slim, but it might just be worth pursuing... though she feared that she might not return in time to save him. If she was to leave, then she needed to decide now."

hippone_jrnl_misc_gr.7.desc: "The Guide sped out of the cave as fast as she could. Through the blistering chill and scalding snow she ran with such determination that nothing short of divine intervention would stop her. She wouldn't lose another friend. Not again.\n\nFor how long she ran, she didn't know. The Guidance prodded her to turn left and head up a small hill. It wasn't that far now, she could feel it. At the crest of hill, she squinted her eyes and looked all around her. Through the blizzard she spotted something, a series of dirtied tombstones partially hidden in the snow. She made her way to them, only to find that she could not read the odd language hacked onto them.\n\nMany of the gravestones had suffered from severe wear and tear, but the Guide could tell that love and care had been put into almost all of them, for no two shared a design. Unfortunately she did not know which one held the Hammer. The Guidance's aid had ended here, she was on her own.\n\nThe Guide considered picking graves at random to dig up, but dismissed the idea as she would likely freeze to death before she found the Hammer. None of the gravestones seemed to suggest that any particular grave held the mythical item she sought. She grit her teeth, the cold was starting to numb her extremities. Just as she had resigned herself to starting with the fanciest looking grave, she noticed something: All of the gravestones had a pony etched on them... except for one. The last was a small, otherwise unremarkable stone marker had a bear-shaped form on it.\n\nShe immediately began to dig. If this "Thunder Bear" was buried here, then the Hammer must be with them. By the time she had removed enough snow to access the grave, her hooves had begun to feel like they were burning. Not a good sign, she grimaced. With significant effort, she managed to heft open the grave. Inside was a partially decomposed pony with what looked like the pelt of a polar bear on it. Bear claws were strewn about a necklace around its neck, and in its hooves was a dull, withered-looking hammer.\n\nThe Guide reached down and grasped the hammer. As the legends said, she was suddenly filled with the strength to persevere. She briefly allowed herself to smile, then remembered why she had hurried so much to get here. With renewed vigor, she turned around and ran back towards the cave she had left Zethro in."

Her eyes darted in all directions as she struggled to search. Most equines would have long since frozen to death, but sheer force of will kept her going.\n\nAdding to her frustrations, the Guidance was silent again. She had considered trying to force it to help her, though she had a sinking feeling that doing so would only make her situation worse. She resigned herself to simply keep looking.\n\nAfter some time, she spotted a rock formation jutting out of the snow through the corner of her eye. She sprinted towards it, hoping beyond hope that it belonged to the cave she'd left Zethro in. When she got to it, her heart surged with hope as she recognized the cavern entrance.\n\nShe froze when she saw an additional set of hoofprints leaving the cave. Panic began to set in. She looked inside, but Zethro wasn't there. The Guide sprinted back outside. She began to follow the other set of hoofprints. They appeared to be heavy tracks in the snow, suggesting that someone had dragged their hooves through it. She followed the tracks with a sinking feeling in her gut. "Please be alive, please be alive..."\n\nHer heart skipped a beat when she stepped on something that was most certainly not the ground. She looked down to see an unmoving Zethro who was partially obscured by the snow. The Guide tore the snow away to get to get to him. Fear washed over her as she realized he wasn't breathing.\n\nShe grabbed his hoof and shoved the hammer onto it, but nothing happened. "No! You can't die now!" she sobbed. She kept pushing the hammer into his hoof and praying for a miracle that wouldn't come. "Please... please... not like this..." Tears streamed down her face, some freezing to her cheeks. This wasn't how it was meant to be. Wasn't how it was meant to happen...\n\nShe remembered how scared he had sounded when he asked her not to leave. Did he know that he was about to die? Was he so afraid of dying alone that he tried to follow her? It didn't matter now. She had failed him. She let one of the few equines that she had actually grown to trust die. And she would carry this fact with her always."

Between laboured breaths, he told her of things like his latest day at school, the bullies that troubled him, the cute filly he liked, and what games he played with his friends.\n\n"M-mom?

If things had gone differently, might he still be here with her now? Or would fate have taken him away no matter what?

"How does it feel, crypto-avian? To lose someone close to you?"\n\nThe pegasus tried to take flight and flee, but the Guide's blade was faster. Soon, two bodies laid at the Guide's hooves. She took in a deep breath, trying to take solace in the knowledge that she had removed another two stains from this world. Though something felt different, this time.

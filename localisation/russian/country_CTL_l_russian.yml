 ### FOCUS ###

 CTL_the_1_year_plan:0 "...Один останется"
 CTL_the_1_year_plan_desc:0 "Начинается читальский сезон ранней росы, и к его открытию Ярил снова произнесёт речь с обещаниями милостей для заслуженных крестьян и ремесленников Читала, а также с надеждами на возвращение былого единства и величия разделённой страны. Однако, учитывая нынешнюю политическую ситуацию, в этом году его слова будут нужны народу как никогда раньше."

 CTL_call_up_the_nobles:0 "Встреча с Тройкой"
 CTL_call_up_the_nobles_desc:0 "На решение стоящих перед государством проблем к следующему сезону Мунпани у Бенджена есть год — нельзя позволить Читальской Оси хоть как-то повлиять на Совет Семи в этот срок. Чтобы решить вопрос влияния Оси, Бенджену созовёт встречу с тремя своими самыми доверенными советниками, чтобы прислушиваться лишь к разумным советам и речам."

 CTL_deal_with_dannya_shah:0 "Разобраться с шахитами"
 CTL_deal_with_dannya_shah_desc:0 "Похоже, смутьянка Даннья Шах и её Читальский Народно-Освободительный Фронт продолжают усиливать влияние коммунизма. Коль скоро нам необходимо остановить распространение этой новой идеологии хаоса и разрушения, следует для начала послать весточку тем глупцам, что поддержали её — начиная с запрета шахитской революционной пропаганды."

 CTL_seer_issue:0 "Преподобнейший саммит"
 CTL_seer_issue_desc:0 "Годи, представители традиционной оленийской религии, издавна занимают высокие должности при дворе. В то же время их влияние оспаривается нашими подданными из числа коренных жителей, а многие мелкие князья видят в них угрозу своей власти из-за тесных связей годи с фракцией Якоба Седого. Пора окончательно определить роль этих святых оленей в нашем правительстве."

 CTL_sikh_issue:0 "Проблема Туймаиянату"
 CTL_sikh_issue_desc:0 "На протяжении сотен лет местная религиозная секта, известная как «Туя», обреталась на задворках читальской политики. В эти тяжелые времена она заметно расширилась за счёт благотворительности, а также открытого неповиновения нашему режиму. Хуже всего то, что в их рядах — сам Бхушан Дерзкий. Следует решить, что делать с этим движением, пока не поздно."

 CTL_the_fate_of_the_council:0 "Разобраться с Советом"
 CTL_the_fate_of_the_council_desc:0 "Совет Семи был создан, чтобы найти общий язык с коренной знатью, но успехи оказались неоднозначными. Хотя условия жизни коренных жителей улучшились, многие видят в Совете лишь инструмент для поддержки ярлской власти. Теперь, когда Совет теряет авторитет и раскалывается на фракции, Бенджену придётся решать будущее этого учреждения."
 
 CTL_choosing_an_advisor:0 "Фракция-фаворит"
 CTL_choosing_an_advisor_desc:0 "Каждая из трех фракций Совета обладает значительной властью в Читале. У Ярила есть свои планы реформ и преобразований, но заседающие в Совете придворные имеют шанс склонить монарха на свою сторону. В залах заседаний и дворцовых кулуарах решается судьба страны."

 CTL_on_the_berserkers:0 "Его Величества репутация"
 CTL_on_the_berserkers_desc:0 "Каждый читалец, да и не только, знает нашего Ярила как добрую и робкую натуру. Хотя такой характер вполне гармонирует с его преобразованиями, советников вроде Якоба Седого совершенно не радует то, насколько правитель непохож на своего отца — Бенджена IV. Может быть, Ярилу пора попытаться измениться?"

 CTL_adding_more_yesdeer:0 "Новое лицо"
 CTL_adding_more_yesdeer_desc:0 "В настоящее время Бенджену не хватает политической поддержки там, где это крайне необходимо. Можно было бы добиться благосклонности одной из фракций Читала и серьёзным образом и укрепить свои позиции, назначив себе нового советника. Вопрос лишь в том, кого именно?"

 CTL_council_call_up:0 "Семеро войдут..."
 CTL_council_call_up_desc:0 "Семеро оленей всех мастей, включая самого Бенджена, составляют Совет Семи, скованный в хиндийском хаосе начала нулевых. Раз уж к концу года Читалу суждено знатно преобразиться, мы должны выиграть борьбу за влияние на этот орган и сохранить верность сидящих в нём царедворцев... либо, если всё пойдёт ко дну, цареубийц."

 CTL_the_council_of_9:0 "Совет для девяти"
 CTL_the_council_of_9_desc:0 "Ситуация всё больше походит на одну из тяжелейших в истории Читала, и каждая фракция хочет что-то предпринять. Под давлением всего Совета Ярил добавит еще одно место в правительстве. Вся политическая расстановка сил зависит от того, кто это место займёт."

 CTL_the_supply_issue:0 "Поставки против повстанцев"
 CTL_the_supply_issue_desc:0 "Южные земли всегда было тяжело удерживать в копытах. Они и раньше были полны коммунистами и мятежными князьями. А теперь у повстанцев появился доступ к взрывчатке и пушкам, и наша логистика превращается в руины. Необходимо установить непрерывную линию снабжения южных территорий, чтобы подавить этот бунт."

 CTL_pacify_the_south:0 "Положить конец Фронту"
 CTL_pacify_the_south_desc:0 "Лояльные воинские части выследили последний оплот ЧНОФ на южных холмах, и мы готовы окончательно уничтожить Фронт. Ярил, в соответствии с традицией, лично поведет свои войска на битву с мятежниками. Читал избавится от них раз и навсегда!"

 CTL_infiltrate_her_entourage:0 "Наши олени в её свите"
 CTL_infiltrate_her_entourage_desc:0 "Многие члены ЧНОФ не являются сторонниками коммунизма, не все даже откровенно желают свергнуть Ярила. Это недовольные и обнищавшие олени, которых еще можно привести к разуму силой убеждения. Мы отправим королевских оперативников, которые проникнут во Фронт и поспособствуют разобщению в его рядах. Метод проведения операции подлежит обсуждению..."

 CTL_the_fate_of_the_ringleaders:0 "Её связи в нашей свите"
 CTL_the_fate_of_the_ringleaders_desc:0 "Даннья Шах всегда оказывается на шаг впереди нас, и её войска постоянно превосходят наши расчёты. Вечные несостыковки в стратегии начали вызывать подозрение у королевского двора. Письмо с печатью Данньи, найденное в поле пряностей, может дать нам зацепку; возможно мы даже имеем дело с чем-то большим, чем кучка коммунистов."

 CTL_taking_back_the_spice:0 "Вернуть себе специи"
 CTL_taking_back_the_spice_desc:0 "Плантации специй во внутреннем Читале всегда были источником дохода для тех, кто их контролирует. В настоящее время они находятся в копытах южных мятежников. Вернув себе плантации, мы не только оборвём повстанцам источник средств и оружия, но и обеспечим государство финансированием, столь необходимым для улаживания затянутого конфликта."

 CTL_royal_progress:0 "Высочайшее посещение Юга"
 CTL_royal_progress_desc:0 "Ярил решил отправиться в путешествие по Югу, встретиться со своими сторонниками и противниками и попытаться укрепить тем самым свою власть.\n\nБудем надеяться, что он знает, что делает."
 
 
 ###THE NAVAL TREE, BOW DOWN###
 CTL_restoring_our_pride:0 "Restoring Our Pride"
 CTL_restoring_our_pride_desc:0 "When our Olenian ancestors arrived on this continent they did so in command of the greatest fleet of their time. Now, the pitiful state of our fleet leaves the spirits of our forefathers displeased, and our future as a serious power in doubt. We must dedicate resources towards reinvigorating our naval heritage."

 CTL_legacy_of_the_sea_kings:0 "Legacy Of The Sea Kings"
 CTL_legacy_of_the_sea_kings_desc:0 "The Sea Kings, the thalassocratic masters of the deep blue from centuries past, showed the world with their grand fleets the power of our people: nowhere was beyond the might and justice of deerkind; no evil can rest with righteous wind in our sails. Now is the time for us to look to the past so that we too may command great fleets and conquer our place among the glorious few in the coming storm."

 CTL_legacy_of_the_raiders:0 "Legacy Of The Vikingar"
 CTL_legacy_of_the_raiders_desc:0 "The Vikingar: sea phantoms of yore — whose sudden assaults swept every coastline in search of plunder — are romanticized subjects of national pride for deer of Olenian descent. We must reinvigorate their memory with raids anew: terror shall sweep the seas, and new developments into light vessels will ensure nothing is beyond our reach."

 CTL_a_new_form_of_raiding:0 "A New Form Of Raiding"
 CTL_a_new_form_of_raiding_desc:0 "Valuable experiences from our recent naval reforms, as well as conflicts abroad, have taught us the hidden strategic potential in regards to submarines. If we are to spread terror from the surface, then dread too shall emerge from under the waves as we innovate upon the principles of hit-and-run warfare to send enemy tonnage to the bottom of the sea."

 CTL_large_scale_submarine_investments:0 "Supremacy On The Seas"
 CTL_large_scale_submarine_investments_desc:0 "No race but deer, and deer alone, can be masters of the sea. Our submarines — with renewed funding fueling their development — will organize into herds, from which they can harass and destroy the enemy from beneath the depths with greater efficiency."

 CTL_form_the_chital_admirality:0 "Formalize The Chitali Admirality"
 CTL_form_the_chital_admirality_desc:0 "Outside our naval colleges, dilapidated statues of great admirals and intrepid sea lords from history look down upon us from pillars of triumph. If our navy is to be the envy of the world, then our government must focus on consolidating an admiralty. It is only then when we may build monuments to new heroes."

 CTL_prepare_the_chitali_marines:0 "Prepare The Chitali Marines"
 CTL_prepare_the_chitali_marines_desc:0 "The first and most renowned bulwark against outside threats are our Marines. The Chitali Marine Corps, CMC, have historically been our most elite fighting force: they are the tip of the spear, the shield of the Yaril's family, and they are in a piteous state of affairs. If Chital is to ever revitalize the ambitions of our ancestors, then we must bring the CMC to contemporary standards as soon as possible."

 CTL_infrastructure_near_sri_cervidae:0 "The [SRI.GetName] Waterway"
 CTL_infrastructure_near_sri_cervidae_desc:0 "The demand we've set for building new naval vessels has surpassed the capacity of even our greatest dockyards, and the space in our naval bases dwindle as more and more ships are forced into crammed harbours. As a remedy to this problem, several prominent politicians and naval officers have suggested building dockyards and factories on the coast of Uusi Hirvimaa to build and house new vessels."

 CTL_dockyards_in_the_capital:0 "Building A Naval Hub"
 CTL_dockyards_in_the_capital_desc:0 "There is perhaps no greater industry in the history of deerkind than shipbuilding. The art of laying down vessels and building a fleet is as integral to the spirit of our race as friendship is to ponies and trivial fratricide is to zebras. It is because of this tradition our nation's burgeoning shipbuilding economy continues to grow. We must dedicate sectors of our economy towards fostering this industry."

 CTL_naval_designer:0 "Hire The Companies"
 CTL_naval_designer_desc:0 "Businessdeer representing a Macawian-based naval development firm have come forward with a proposal to work under Chitali government contract. Accepting their offer will undoubtedly help make trade relations with our neighbors to the north more cordial while letting their experts hasten the development of our navy."

 CTL_support_from_the_naval_houses:0 "Rally The Naval Houses"
 CTL_support_from_the_naval_houses_desc:0 "The aristocracy of our nation is not immune to the draw of the sea, rather, many houses are ennobled by mastery of the waves. By bidding for the support of the naval houses, their craftsdeer will be available to build light vessels at a higher rate of production."

 CTL_formalize_the_yaril_aatto_port:0 "Formalize Aattohamn"
 CTL_formalize_the_yaril_aatto_port_desc:0 "Aattohamn, a quaint, semi-industrial coastal city with a prestigious reputation as home to many seasoned shipbuilding families, has been the site of a large influx of workers who've come to participate in the reforging of the Chitali maritime industry. We should invest in developing Aattohamn even further, not just as a shipbuilding city, but as a thriving seaside economic powerhouse."
 
 CTL_worthy_of_the_old_traditions:0 "The New Knarrs"
 CTL_worthy_of_the_old_traditions_desc:0 "The first Olenians — the heroes we venerate, the ancestors we celebrate — to spot the coast of Zebrica were sailors aboard knarrs. Today, we honour their legacy by titling our newest achievement in honour of their triumph. Chitali Knarrs are bastions of the endeavors of deerkind: battleships of tremendous power capable of rendering our foes into submission with overwhelming firepower." 

 CTL_the_strongest_ships:0 "The Strongest Ships"
 CTL_the_strongest_ships_desc:0 "A mighty open seas fleet is not only imperative for maintaining the interests of our country abroad, it is crucial for our very survival. Dedicating resources towards research and development on more advanced battleships will ensure that no foreign navy can cripple our future."

 CTL_chital_rules_waves:0 "A Prescence On Every Shore"
 CTL_chital_rules_waves_desc:0 "Deer, and deer alone, will once again be the masters of the sea. Our navy is now not only set to the modern standards we first theorized of, but in many ways an advanced force rivalling or even surpassing the greatest global powers. The incipience of our modernization program may've been slow, but now we can be certain: our seafaring ancestors smile down upon our illustrious navy from the heavens!"
 
 
 ### THE QUESTION OF THE MILITARY ELITES ###
  CTL_the_question_of_the_military_elites:0 "The Fate Of The Yaril's Army"
 CTL_the_question_of_the_military_elites_desc:0 "Backwater, destitute; orthodox, proven. These words like a plague linger in the halls of our military schools and in debates between staff officers of the new and old guards. Chitali staff officers are torn on how the future of our army should fight, but between the two camps there is a unanimous consensus: our disorganized army must undergo radical changes if we are to survive the coming storm."

 CTL_purge_the_armed_forces:0 "Purge The Jakobites"
 CTL_purge_the_armed_forces_desc:0 "The future of our army is the future of our nation: the future of our people! Our patience for the Olenian peerage has run its course... the lily-livered Jakobite parasites must be annihilated, for the honour of Mahimata!"

 CTL_mass_assault_lol_funni:0 "We Have Troops! Use Them!"
 CTL_mass_assault_lol_funni_desc:0 "The Yogi teach us of the strength of virtuous, overwhelming power. Therefore, to our new cohorts of strategists, there is nothing more righteous than an indomitable swarm of infantry and artillery! We shouldn't complicate ourselves with the matter of tanks and trenches, let the earth tremble, whether it be from our guns or under our thunderous hooves!"

 CTL_omg_epic_kemerskai_tactics:0 "Focus On Artillery"
 CTL_omg_epic_kemerskai_tactics_desc:0 "Fortune favours those with superior firepower. Artillery is the queen of the battlefield: she is the patron of grand batteries, who — unlike mighty battalions — consistently bring victory. We should dedicate all relevant military funding towards making our gunners the most skilled in Zebrica, as well as research towards bringing our field artillery tactics up to contemporary standards."

 CTL_fresh_native_officers:0 "Fresh Native Units"
 CTL_fresh_native_officers_desc:0 "Our nation's military has traditionally not been a very popular employer of the Hindian-majority population, who for generations has seen it as nothing more than an extension of the incessant bickering of the Olenian aristocracy. Now, new troops are needed to fill the vacant ranks left by recent restructuring. Sending recruitment officers to the countryside will invariably bring recruitment figures up."

 CTL_heat_acclimation:0 "Heat Acclimation Tactics"
 CTL_heat_acclimation_desc:0 "When the first Olenians arrived onto this continent it wasn't a war or a great disaster that decimated their settlers, it was the weather. The heat, unbearable for foreign invaders, can be of great tactical use to us; the natives of this land are already well-acclimated to the heat, able to evade heatstroke and illness. Further extreme weather training will ensure our forces are masters of hot weather warfare."

 CTL_adopt_their_theories:0 "Adopt Their Theories"
 CTL_adopt_their_theories_desc:0 "As the dominance of Olenian strategic theory declines as a consequence of the changing demographics of our military, proponents of previously ignored Hindian military strategy have become the dominant faction in our general staff. Hindian military theory places a higher value on frugal logistics and reconnaissance than traditional deer warfare, which we can exploit."

 CTL_army_of_a_modern_chital:0 "Army Of A Modern Chital"
 CTL_army_of_a_modern_chital_desc:0 "The modern Chitali army is unrecognizable to the ramshackle forces who safeguarded our borders in the past. Hitherto our regiments were the subjects of mockery, their officers an embarrassment to the art of war. Now those who once derided our army stand in awe at its magnificence. Chital is now guarded by a well-organized fighting force utilizing modern tactics and equipment. Chital is ready for war."

 CTL_depoliticize_the_army:0 "Depoliticize The Chitali Army"
 CTL_depoliticize_the_army_desc:0 "The Chitali Army in all but name is a disjointed collection of bickering factions, even after the Jakobite purge. If we are to seriously consolidate our army into an effective, organized fighting force, then it is imperative we move to depoliticize our army. A more thorough purge will also force open new investment opportunities for small arms concerns still loyal to the old guard."

 CTL_special_forces_divisions:0 "Promote Special Forces Research"
 CTL_special_forces_divisions_desc:0 "The capricious state of warfare shows an increasing trend towards elite units capable of performing specialized tasks no soldier could accomplish normally. The daring exploits of these nonpareil foreign troops — particularly paratroopers and mountaineers — has garnered enough attention amongst our staff officers for significant resources to be pooled into a special forces research fund."

 CTL_new_research_divisions:0 "New Research Divisions"
 CTL_new_research_divisions_desc:0 "The revolutionary changes to our army have brought many once irrelevant officers, or those who couldn't even have their voice heard in the first place, to the forefront of our reorganization program. A band of company officers and industrial concerns have stepped forward to see how they can put their knowledge to good use, asking if they could form new divisions for military research."

 CTL_promote_ieffri_huddarnen:0 "Bolster Traditionalist Officers"
 CTL_promote_ieffri_huddarnen_desc:0 "The future of our army cannot be jeopardized by those too morally infirm and mentally incapable of properly running a military! Ieffri Huddarnen, a staunch Jakobite staff officer of Olenian descent, has proven himself to be a more than capable of leader to guide this radical transformation. We should remodel the officer corps after his example and promote him to marshal at once."

 CTL_jakubs_obsession:0 "Jakob's New Obsession"
 CTL_jakubs_obsession_desc:0 "Jakob the Grey may be a traditionalist in the political sphere, but certainly not when it comes to the affairs of the army. A brilliant strategist, general, and admiral, Jakob's next modernity to Chital's grand army has been the institution of tanks, a process we must continue."

 CTL_the_tried_and_tested:0 "The Tried And Tested"
 CTL_the_tried_and_tested_desc:0 "Why should we complicate war with newfangled tractors with guns on them when weathering and swarming the enemy in elaborate plans always works? Why waste valuable time and resources on developing armoured vehicles when we can instead destroy enemy armies in one fell, dramatic swoop? There is plenty of experience to draw from to create a truly concrete grand battle plan."

 CTL_entrench_jakobite_control:0 "Royal Military Companies"
 CTL_entrench_jakobite_control_desc:0 "The Chitali arms industry is a collection of cottage private arms manufacturers and a handful of state owned factories. The Jakobites have voiced concerns about the inability of the current state of our military-industrial complex to fulfil the needs of our growing army. We should move to not just subsidize new military factories throughout the country, but to also establish a Chitali state armory."

 CTL_conserving_our_deer:0 "Conserving Our Deer"
 CTL_conserving_our_deer_desc:0 "There is no stronger weapon in our arsenal, no greater treasure in our exchequer, and no greater good in this world than our people. We now have the means and economic stability to introduce advanced healthcare to our population. Facilitating an environment conducive to medical advances will undoubtedly ensure the stability of our population's health: civilian and military."

 CTL_motorized_and_mechanized_finalization:0 "Huddarnen Motorized Plans"
 CTL_motorized_and_mechanized_finalization_desc:0 "The days of long, exhausting infantry maneuvers on the battlefield are over! Marshal Huddarnen has long been an advocate for motorization and mechanization, which would give our command level units greater maneuverability and flexibility on the battlefield. \n"The future is now, the future is deer on wheels!""

 CTL_branch_coordination:0 "Inter-Branch Coordination"
 CTL_branch_coordination_desc:0 "Every branch of our land forces should be committed towards accomplishing the same mission. By integrating the commands of different branches towards a greater joint strategic command, we will be able to coordinate all elements of our army to succeed at a united objective."

 CTL_core_infantry_research:0 "Core Infantry Research Departments"
 CTL_core_infantry_research_desc:0 "All warfare is a matter of infantry. While our strategic theorists may have gotten lost with developing new tanks, or new ways to build trenches, we have not forgotten the importance of the little deer who truly carries the day. A handful of military-industrial concerns have requested the government to fund new research departments. Obliging them would ensure our infantry have the best weapons available."

 CTL_tap_into_olenian_magic:0 "Tap Into Olenian Magic"
 CTL_tap_into_olenian_magic_desc:0 "Deerkind is blessed with magic. Premonitions of the future and a spiritual link to the past are the landmarks guiding the present being for a deer. The land we trot, the skies breathing wind over our heads, they're all extensions of an incorporeal reality. And we can weaponize that. We should look towards synergizing our tactics with the magic of the Olenians, masters of cold weather warfare and logistics."

 CTL_create_the_chitali_air_force:0 "Formalize The Chitali Air Force"
 CTL_create_the_chitali_air_force_desc:0 "The Chitali Air Force is, without a doubt, the most neglected branch of our military. Essentially a collection of wealthy nobles, leisure pilots, and knowledgeable foreigners, this informal "air force" is nothing more than a quaint aerial yacht club with guns. Battlefields may be won by those on the ground, but in the future wars will be decided by the superior air force, and we can't afford to lose future wars."

 CTL_gadra_family_industrial_plans:0 "House Gadra Industrial Plans"
 CTL_gadra_family_industrial_plans_desc:0 "House Gadra, home to some of Chital's most renowned pilots, will soon also be home to our aerial modernization program. Gadrani aircraft, renowned for their deerlike light frames and nimble nature, have never formally been put into production. If we are to create a respectable Chitali Air Force, we will need their help. We should build an air plant and pave an airfield in their home city of Viirsti to court their support."

 CTL_hindian_recon:0 "Hindian Reconnaissance"
 CTL_hindian_recon_desc:0 "Throughout the history of deerkind, foreign threats have often been soundly subdued by the amount of information scouts and seers have been able to ascertain about their forces. Deer are masters of reconnaissance, and this faculty for parting the fog of war is not lost on our fledgling air force. No enemy can hide for long with Chitali scouts in the skies."

 CTL_bombing_technology:0 "Begin Bomber Development"
 CTL_bombing_technology_desc:0 "With each passing war that pushes the world further into darkness, the nature of war itself is made more grim. Total war — a wild and terrifying reality where entire populations are driven to fight and survive — is an inevitable, uncomfortable reality.

 CTL_gri_plane_tech:0 "Support From The Feathisians"
 CTL_gri_plane_tech_desc:0 "Our air force must model its future strategy after that of another country. The inconsistency of war leads us towards the most flexible doctrine, and there is no doctrine more versatile than Feathisia's.

 CTL_wng_plane_tech_desc:0 "Our air force must model its future strategy after that of another country. All facets of warfare, all weapons and vehicles are designed for one purpose: to support infantry. The Regia Aernoautica of Wingbardy has much to teach us about utilizing specialized close air support planes to annihilate hostiles with pinpoint accuracy. \nWe'll send a diplomat to Wingbardy to learn how to support our deer."

CTL_close_the_bureau_desc:0 "The Bureau has served its purpose, and the time has come to close this chapter of Chitali history. Our industrial progress is far beyond what it once was, and we must now give thanks that we have entered the modern era. Whether we pray to the Olenian Gods or to Mahimata, bread shall be broken this night, as Chital enters the annals of modern history."

###HIRA RAMACHAN PATH###

 CTL_ramachan_takes_control_desc:0 "The unassuming leader of the Axis of Chital, Madame Hira Ramachan, has taken control of the Yarildom following the disbanding of the Council of Seven. With her goals of a broad populist agenda and a centralization of political power for the natives and her allies, Hira will surely not allow the traitors who have driven Chital into the ground to go unpunished."

 CTL_puppet_jarl:0 "A Puppet Yaril"
 CTL_puppet_jarl_desc:0 "Brienna Kudlinen, the Yaril's cousin and younger sister of Jakob the Grey, has never been active in Chitali politics, and after Jakob and Benjen's removal from the political scene, is technically the heir to the Yarildom. To truly stabilize our government, we must bring a Yaril back to Chital, and Brienna is just the right doe for the job."

 CTL_a_few_loose_ends:0 "A Few Loose Ends"
 CTL_a_few_loose_ends_desc:0 "There are some members of the Chitali nobility that are beyond redemption. Supporters of a traditional Olenian aristocracy have continued to oppose our government, and if they ever took control of Chital again, would surely enslave the Hindians once more. If we wish to ensure the stability of the Ramachan government, these traditionalists must be purged."

 CTL_exile_the_heir:0 "Exile The Grey Viking"
 CTL_exile_the_heir_desc:0 "A vicious enforcer of the whims of the Yaril and his predecessors, Jakob the Grey has left a trail of Hindian blood in his wake. While we surely admire his military prowess, there is no need for him to remain in government any longer, as he has shown himself to only be loyal to the Yaril and his own authority. He must be exiled, as he has most certainly overstayed his welcome."

 CTL_send_out_their_secrets:0 "Selling Secrets"
 CTL_send_out_their_secrets_desc:0 "As the court's de-facto Spymistress for years, Hira Ramachan has developed a certain wealth of information pertaining to the hidden desires and controversial political motives of her previous higher-ups. With the people still sceptical of Madame Hira's newfound position of power, perhaps it is the perfect time to reveal the pleasures, deadly intrigue, and corruption of the Chitali nobility."

 CTL_factionalize_the_crown_loyalists:0 "Operatives in the Resistance"
 CTL_factionalize_the_crown_loyalists_desc:0 "The resistance to the Axis of Chital is prone to ideological squabbling of their own, especially the traditionalists and the reformists, who, even with completely different philosophies, have united against Madame Hira and the Axis. Our efforts must be furthered to factionalize the resistance, so that it pains Jakob the Grey and Benjen Davirtannen to even look at each other."

 CTL_bhushan_as_deputy:0 "Appoint Bhushan As Deputy"
 CTL_bhushan_as_deputy_desc:0 "Bhushan Gurat has served as Ramachan's greatest ally in the government and in the Axis for years. Herra Ivar may be a dignified figurehead for some deer, but Bhushan is the epitome of the spirit of the people of Chital. A protector of the native culture and way of life and staunch agrarian populist, Bhushan is what Chital needs as its deputy, not more prancing nobles with minds only for themselves."

 CTL_work_with_hoversholm:0 "Work With Herra Ivar"
 CTL_work_with_hoversholm_desc:0 "Bhushan Gurat's position in government is a complicated situation, but one thing remains clear - that he is not the correct candidate to serve as Hira's right hand deer, especially because of his radical ideology. Ivar Hoversholm, while a forceful and often disruptive personality, is a competent administrator and good friend to Madame Hira, and so shall take Bhushan's place as unofficial second-in-command."

 CTL_an_axis_eternal:0 "All Cards On The Table"
 CTL_an_axis_eternal_desc:0 "Chital is the Axis, and the Axis is Chital. With the legacy of the corrupt monarchy of the Kudlinens all but eradicated and a puppet monarch installed loyal to the populist goals of the Axis, it appears that a new dawn is finally in reach for Chital. Now, Hira must turn her eyes to the opposition that still lurks in the shadows... and on the world stage."

 CTL_restructure_the_army_desc:0 "Jakob the Grey and his murderous raiders may have once been an influential part of Chitali society, but now, they are simply a useless relic of Chital's bloodstained past.

 CTL_the_watchful_eye_desc:0 "It takes but one crack to let in weakness and crumble a kingdom.

 CTL_their_outdated_customs:0 "Diplomats On Every Corner"
 CTL_their_outdated_customs_desc:0 "Too many of our Hindian brothers view Chital's leaders as wretched imperialists, who have continued to oppress the natives of our nation even under Ramachan's government. This cannot be further from the truth. Our international policy must entail returning to the world stage as a friend to all Hindians, and an ally to the oppressed of all Zebrica."

 CTL_open_economy:0 "A Long Road to Justice"
 CTL_open_economy_desc:0 "For too long have the honourable deer of Chital been beaten down by an economic and social order that cares only for their own image. We must chart a new course that can end the oppression of our Hindian brothers, but to do so, we must bring in some actual economic advisors not focused on lining their pockets."

 CTL_break_the_system:0 "All Power to the Agencies"
 CTL_break_the_system_desc:0 "The Council of Seven is above all, an undemocratic structure, designed to oppress the interests of the Axis of Chital and the Chitali people. It has only served to strengthen the authority of Yaril Benjen and his puppets, all the while maintaining a farce of democratic governance in Chital. The Council of Seven must be abolished if we are to truly cement the Axis and bring an end to the Yaril's lies."

 CTL_democratic_pretenses:0 "Just And Democratic Pretenses"
 CTL_democratic_pretenses_desc:0 "Hira and the Axis gained power on promises of populism and anti-elitism, and for that reason, it is clear that the Council of Seven and the oligarchic values it represented would be better left in the past. A Chitali Assembly, with elected representatives from across Hindia, would be a better advisory legislature to Brienna I and Madame Hira than any undemocratic privy council could ever be."

 CTL_redistribute_political_power:0 "The Deer's Ascendance"
 CTL_redistribute_political_power_desc:0 "Should the deer of Chital not rule themselves, as they had for centuries before the barbaric Olenians first landed on our fair shores? It should be the deer themselves that decide who represents them and what the path of Chital should be, not an unelected Oleno-Hindian minority, and certainly not a Axis of Chital dictatorship that would be just as undemocratic. Democracy must come to Chital!"

 CTL_religious_syncretism:0 "A Syncretist Platform"
 CTL_religious_syncretism_desc:0 "Hira has never been a particularly religious doe, viewing it more as a social and political tool than an actual moral truth. However, Chital is a deeply religious nation, and simply declaring the nation a secular state would inspire mass resistance. Knowing that, we shall use religion as a tool to encourage unity and comradery between all free Hindians of Chital, even if we have to edit some funamental tenets."
 
 CTL_gurus_as_teachers:0 "United Under Mahimata"
 CTL_gurus_as_teachers_desc:0 "Mahimata, the mother goddess of Mahimatism, is a core part of Chitali life, and her teachings have guided hundreds of thousands if not millions of Chitalis. Instead of dividing ourselves among Hindian and Olenian lines, we must unite under our common faith and Mahmiata's vision of an agrarian, protected, and integrated Chital."

 CTL_seers_as_propagandists:0 "The Traditionalist In The Room"
 CTL_seers_as_propagandists_desc:0 "Godi Konnar has been reluctant to accept any reforms that remove the dominance of Godi in the Chitali religious scene, continually claiming that they are the only party that can bring about a return to Chital tradition. Unfortunately, he does not seem to be placatable, and continually has held back pro-native and progressive reform. Him and his allies must be marginalized, or somehow... dealt with."

 CTL_a_new_elite:0 "The Herd's Aristocracy"
 CTL_a_new_elite_desc:0 "A new Council of Seven shall be formed for the benefit of the nation, but this time, it will not be overrun by absolutist traitors and controlled opposition without a voice. This time, the Council of Seven will serve Chital, its people, and especially the natives, above all. Ramachan's loyalists may hold all the seats, but if the people prosper, is that inherently negative?"

 CTL_only_the_loyal:0 "A Cloak and Dagger Confederacy"
 CTL_only_the_loyal_desc:0 "The Council of Seven was not fundamentally terrible. While the original design was a complete failure, there is always a possibility the aristocratic design of the Council can be used for something greater. Reforming the Council of Seven to serve the Axis and the people, not the crooked elite, would ensure stable, strong governance, even if it denies the people "democracy"."

 CTL_the_surveillance_state_desc:0 "To make something that will last you have to follow a design and stick to it; you can't just hope for the best and make it up as you go. To build a strong Chital that can stand the test of time everydeer must know their role and stick to it. With a firm hoof Madame Hira has laid out a plan for our future and it is the duty of every citizen to follow it to the letter."
 
 CTL_the_hundred_year_yarildom:0 "A Chital to Call Home At Last"
 CTL_the_hundred_year_yarildom_desc:0 "Guidance and care need not be cruel. By setting out a framework of the state and allowing our deer to operate freely within that framework they can find the best way to achieve Hira's goals. Like the mother of the nation, she shall raise us up and help us find our path."
 
 CTL_the_new_democracy:0 "The Flower of Hindia Blooms"
 CTL_the_new_democracy_desc:0 "The government of Chital is there to serve the deer of the nation, not the other way. Maintaining stability and maintaining control are two very different things. By allowing our deer to dictate the direction they want the nation to go they will be happier and more willing to work towards that future, leaving the government free to take the best route there."

 CTL_banking_reform:0 "Liberal Market Reforms"
 CTL_banking_reform_desc:0 "A tightly controlled economy cannot respond quickly enough to global changes in demand, supply, shipping and conflict. By allowing the economy to develop in response to the market we can better predict these changes and trends and make the most of them. Not total freedom of course, that would be ridiculous, the corruption of the banking sector is well known for instance."

 CTL_phase_out_thralldom_desc:0 "Benjen Davirtannen is a good industrialist but he is also a shrewd politician in his own right having served on the council for many years.

 CTL_radical_industrialization:0 "Statism for the Herd"
 CTL_radical_industrialization_desc:0 "If our government and economic advisory council would decide to follow a strictly capitalist system, the same structural inequalities that characterized the past Chitali regime would emerge once again, and the Hindians would be worse off for it.

 CTL_control_economy:0 "Steer The Economy"
 CTL_control_economy_desc:0 "Our country has been allowed to stagnate for far too long, without Direction or purpose it is fallen behind and become the great shame of the modern world.

 CTL_the_last_true_statesdeer_desc:0 "Ivar Hoversholm is the last true protector of Chital! He has thrown off the corrupt monarchs who have led the nation astray, and masterfully deceived the petulant Axis who aimed to rip the nation to shreds! He is the epitome of the true statesdeer and has earned the right to lead us into the future!"

 CTL_an_axis_without_purpose:0 "The Stab in the Back"
 CTL_an_axis_without_purpose_desc:0 "The Axis has outlived its usefulness to us. Its foundations are outdated and despotic, fated to turn into the same monarchist ploy Ivar so valiantly overthrew. It is time to disband this triarchy and to implement the rule of one, and bring true freedom to the land."

 CTL_battle_for_the_soul_of_chital:0 "A Battle for the Soul of Chital"
 CTL_battle_for_the_soul_of_chital_desc:0 "The nation of Chital is a nation corrupted! It has been lied to for years by the traitorous monarchists and the scheming traditionalists! We are the light by which Chital must guide itself into the future. For if we do not do it, there is none pure of heart enough to do it for us."

 CTL_their_righteous_punishments:0 "Leave Them to the Past"
 CTL_their_righteous_punishments_desc:0 "At the core of our righteous ideology is a hatred for the outdated monarchy and the oppressive nobles. Though now that we are in control, we can finally do something about those perfidious fools. Sweeping legal abolishment of all of their titles and trinkets shall be their fate, and we shall stand on high knowing we have finally won."

 CTL_ivars_great_confederation_desc:0 "Hail to Ivar Hoversholm! He alone has done what it takes to bring true democracy to Chital! No more shall we be ruled by lying monarchs and outdated nobles! Chital can now only go forward into a bright new future under our glorious Kansleri!\nLong live Ivar! Long live Chital!"

 CTL_to_each_their_own:0 "A True Economy Of Opportunity"
 CTL_to_each_their_own_desc:0 "Ivar has shown the way forward. To modernise Chital, we will have to follow his example and crack open the outdated grip of the nobles on our factories, strip them of their influence and build an industrial base in which everydeer has the chance to rise."

 CTL_work_with_davirtannen:0 "Work With Davirtannen"
 CTL_work_with_davirtannen_desc:0 "With Davirtannen we face a tricky issue. He is a noble and so should be removed but he is also that rare example of a noble who knows what they're talking about. If we grant him clemency, he can help support our industrialisation."

 CTL_end_monopolies:0 "End the Industrial Cartels"
 CTL_end_monopolies_desc:0 "If we're going to restructure our economy, we have to be forceful. Cutting corners and granting concessions now will only hurt us in the long run. The days of economic domination are done, and a clean, open and liberal industrial base is the national interest."

 CTL_subsidiarity:0 "The Toissijaisuus Principle"
 CTL_subsidiarity_desc:0 "A successful business is a wonderful thing; it generates jobs and fuels the economy, but a narrow base can easily collapse. We should encourage the industries and businesses of Chital to diversify, invest in each other and secure a broad, stable base to expand on."

 CTL_decentralize_economic_power:0 "Decentralize Economic Power"

 CTL_chitali_workers_councils_desc:0 "A happy worker works harder, that is well known. In order to address any grievances, we'll set up worker's representation to air problems they may have before they spiral into discontent. We may even learn of more efficient way of doing things."

 CTL_to_dream_together_of_utopia_desc:0 "Some may scoff and some may sneer, but with the aid of the common people of Chital, our Kansleri must continue to push radical economic reforms through the Riksdag. Is it too radical to suggest that in time, Hindia can stand above all other nations as a superpower in economic and political development, second only to the great nations of Equus?"

 CTL_the_light_of_the_republic:0 "Building a Hindian Republic"
 CTL_the_light_of_the_republic_desc:0 "A Republic is a new concept to Chital; we have lived with the council and Yaril for hundreds and shaking off those old traditions will not be easy. We'll have to find our hooves and workout the best course of action as we build the future."

 CTL_an_end_to_the_progressives_desc:0 "Our nation still has a problem, snakes circle us at every turn, and none less than the "progressives." They use this title to bait good meaning citizens into supporting their crypto-monarchist policies, as all of us know whose pocket, they were in when Benjen still ruled. We must decide what to do with them soon, or lest the viper sinks its teeth in."

 CTL_shatter_the_shadow:0 "Integrate the Loyal Shahites"
 CTL_shatter_the_shadow_desc:0 "Prominent socialist revolutionary Dannya Shah was imprisoned by the government of Benjen V and his cronies among the nobility to secure their own power in the face of popular resistance. While Hoversholm has no love for Marksism, freeing imprisoned communists would be a gesture of support to any leftist republicans afraid of joining the government."
 
 CTL_a_controlled_opposition:0 "Harmonic Centralism"
 CTL_a_controlled_opposition_desc:0 "We stand for peace, justice, for reconciliation with the Hindian class and the masses of Chital, struggling to break free. Any opposition would lend credence to ideas contrary to these principles! Until Hindia is freed, debate must be permitted only within the ranks of the party, where constructive ideas can be shared by those who respect our Kansleri, and Republicanism."

 CTL_southern_connections:0 "A Ceremonial Opposition"
 CTL_southern_connections_desc:0 "Perhaps our original efforts to thwart the Axis of Chital were... misguided. Surely Hira Ramachan will accept an official visit to her domain in Haarihus, asking an important question - how does the position of leader of the opposition sound? Her moderate views do not serve our Republic's ruling class, but a ceremonial opposition would be better than a real one, or none at all."
 
 CTL_a_real_opposition:0 "A Real Opposition"
 CTL_a_real_opposition_desc:0 "Our opposition must be true to their own principles, just as we are true to ours. The great republics of the world pride themselves on free and open debate, even when they are blessed with a leader such as Hoversholm who one cannot oppose without arguments based in falsehood or treachery."

 CTL_friends_in_the_temples:0 "Reconcile The Temples"
 CTL_friends_in_the_temples_desc:0 "The Godi are an integral part of society whether we want them to be or not. They connect the Olenians within Chital with their past and help make them feel at peace here. By embracing the Godi, we can use their influence to pull Olenians to our side."
 
 CTL_liberation_from_the_opiates:0 "Liberation From the Opiates"
 CTL_liberation_from_the_opiates_desc:0 "The religious institutions have done more harm to Chital than any war, turning deer against deer and dividing the nation. To move forward as a united country, we will declare secular state and leave the squabbles of the monks and priests out of politics."
 
 CTL_friends_in_the_tuya:0 "Friends in the Tuya"
 CTL_friends_in_the_tuya_desc:0 "The cult of Mahimata has a long reach within Chital and hold sway over a large chunk of the native Hindian population. By declaring the worship of Mahimata the state religion we'll instantly gain large grassroots support for the republic and the aid of the Tuya."

 CTL_codify_electoral_institutions:0 "To Dream, Together, of Democracy"
 CTL_codify_electoral_institutions_desc:0 "Is it not the desire of all creatures in this world to live free, equal, happy lives under the peaceful reign of a glorious sovereign, as the alicorns of Equestria have reigned for generations? The glorious sovereign is here, but the people's freedom has not truly been unleashed; elections must be called across this continent, so that all Hindians can determine who leads us next."

 CTL_our_glorious_chancellor:0 "Our Glorious Leader"
 CTL_our_glorious_chancellor_desc:0 "The position of Kansleri of the Republic is the highest office in the nation and should be treated with the respect and dignity it deserves. Investing the office with the powers needed to lead the country is the best way of ensuring Chital does not fall into the trap of red tape."

 CTL_our_peoples_liberty:0 "Our Glorious Deer"
 CTL_our_peoples_liberty_desc:0 "The government of Chital is meant to serve the deer, not the other way round. The powers of the state are a privilege, not a right, and those powers should be given to the Riksdag to ensure the privilege is not abused. Let our citizens led the way and the politicians follow their wishes."
 
 CTL_freedom_of_debate:0 "Freedom of Debate"
 CTL_freedom_of_debate_desc:0 "Our new Republican Party must embrace the values of big-tent democracy, where all deer can have their voices heard. Pluralist democracy, not rigid acceptance of party doctrine, must guide the future vision of our government. Let deer of all afilliations title themselves "Hoversholmists", for all who love democracy must love our Kansleri too!"
 
 CTL_unity_of_action:0 "Unity of Action"
 CTL_unity_of_action_desc:0 "The immense diversity of Chital, in interests, morals, and policies, shall in the creation of an open legislature only bring ruin. Instead of heightening such sectarian conflicts through bickering and factionalism, we must prioritize the codification of strict, binding principles based upon popular and enduring ideals - ones that can truly bring unity to disparate people of the Confederation."

 CTL_healing_the_scars:0 "Healing The Scars"
 CTL_healing_the_scars_desc:0 "Oh, woe to Chital for the pain that has been inflicted upon you! But fear not, for now, is the day of the republicans. As other great heroes of republicanism have done across the world, it is now time for Ivar Hoversholm to patch and heal Chital's wounded heart. For he shall save the nation at all costs, no matter who opposes him."

 CTL_a_few_good_nobles:0 "A Few Good Nobles"
 CTL_a_few_good_nobles_desc:0 "The majority of the nobles are stupid, pointless leftovers of an outdated system but a few of them might be of use, holding genuinely useful insights into the culture of our nation. By tapping into this well and the knowledge they have of their communities we can start of piece together a fairer Chital for all."

 CTL_on_the_issue_of_traditionalism:0 "Their Land, Their Titles, Their Honour"
 CTL_on_the_issue_of_traditionalism_desc:0 "The nobility is not a symbol to unite behind, it is one to unite against, growing rich while they've stirred divisions within the nation. Stripping them of all their holdings and powers will break the back of this cultural dead-end."

 CTL_a_shared_identity:0 "Cultivate An Oleno-Hindian Identity"
 CTL_a_shared_identity_desc:0 "A house divided against itself cannot stand. Chital has two cultures vehemently opposed to each other and the balance has only been maintained through oppression and struggle. It is long overdue but we must reshape our society into a united whole if we are ever to overcome the challenges ahead."

 CTL_bureau_of_hindian_affairs:0 "People's Bureau for Southern Affairs"
 CTL_bureau_of_hindian_affairs_desc:0 "The south has been ignored and rejected from economic plans for as long as anydeer can remember. So bad is the problem that we don't even know where to begin. A dedicated department set up to support the development of the south and incentivise cultural unite can begin the long road to healing."

 CTL_struggle_for_liberation:0 "The Struggle for Liberation"
 CTL_struggle_for_liberation_desc:0 "The struggle for freedom is eternal. It takes but one charismatic tyrant to come along and dismantle all that we are trying to build. The defence of our liberty - here and within the reach of our borders - must always be in the forefront of our minds lest it slip through our hooves."
 
 CTL_to_dream_together_of_a_nation:0 "To Dream, Together, of a Nation"
 CTL_to_dream_together_of_a_nation_desc:0 "A united Hindia shall be born among the ashes of the great Yarildoms, Confederations, and Rajs of the continent, where no doe must ever mourn her fawn, and no stag will be left behind to suffer the chains of thralldom or the blistering commands of an ancient monarch. If the Sun and Moon can stand together under alicorn rule, so too can the Hindian and Olenian under our Kansleri's."

 ### YARIL TREE ###
 CTL_the_yaril_asserts_himself:0 "The Two Benjens"
 CTL_the_yaril_asserts_himself_desc:0 "With the aid of Benjen Davirtannen and progressive factions among the people of Chital, Yaril Benjen V has asserted himself as a leader worthy of the title of heir to the Sea-Kings - however, he shall not rule as they did, with fire and sword. Instead, he shall rule with the honor of the Olenian deer, upholding democracy, justice, and loyalty. Long live Chief Minister Davirtannen!"

 CTL_goodbye_jakub:0 "Rejecting Tradition"
 CTL_goodbye_jakub_desc:0 "Jakob the Grey, although a strong and competent warrior and a personal friend to the Yaril and the Kudlinen dynasty, should no longer hold influence over Chital's politics. Let us retire him permanently to the armed forces, and remove the positions in high society that him and his conservative and traditionalist cronies have held for generations."

 CTL_fresh_faces:0 "Strengthen The Six"
 CTL_fresh_faces_desc:0 "Although they have been denied a voice in the Council of Seven for years, the Yaril's personal faction at court, known to the nobility as the "Council of Six", has aided in the advancement of his progressive agenda throughout his reign. Now that the Yaril has formally consolidated control over Chital, it is time to reward them with the respect they deserve."

 CTL_disband_the_axis:0 "Disband The Axis"
 CTL_disband_the_axis_desc:0 "The Axis of Chital has continued to sabotage the Yaril's administration ever since they banded together as the official opposition on the Council of Seven. It is time to formally disband the Axis as a legitimate opposition, and scatter their leaders back to where they belong - out of politics."

 CTL_eqs_mode:0 "The Great Harmonic Transition"
 CTL_eqs_mode_desc:0 "While Equestria is certainly not the only example for sound constitutional governance, it is clear that we must look to the Equestrian system, and not continue the path that the corrupt lords of Olenia originally set for us to follow. The "Chitali Path to Democracy," as the Yaril has labelled it, will blend both Equestrian harmony and Olenian tradition - into one grand progressive agenda."

 CTL_replace_the_administrators:0 "Purge Noble Corruption"
 CTL_replace_the_administrators_desc:0 "The nobles and adminsitrators who have ruled much of Chital have been incompetent captialists and conservatives, intent on lining their pockets with the money of the Yaril and the people. These grandees should be left to rot within their lavish estates, out of politics and out of society. Fairness must always reign in Chital."

 CTL_modernizations:0 "Bring Modernization South"
 CTL_modernizations_desc:0 "The urban lifestyles that have gripped most of Northern Chital's political and social sphere must be brought to the south, where many of the natives are practicing downright primitivist economics! Our government cannot tolerate such a backwater, and so we must endorse a campaign for the transformation of the South."

 CTL_shattering_agrarian_monopolies:0 "Shattering Agricultural Monopolies"
 CTL_shattering_agrarian_monopolies_desc:0 "The nobles of the South must not be excused just because their populace faces so much hardship! Hindian lords such as the backwards Bhushan Gurat control massive tracts of land, and have such developed a lucrative business in less savory industries, all the while keeping thousands of wokers under their thumb. This exploitative practice must end."

 CTL_leap_forward:0 "Subsidize Southern Nationalizations"
 CTL_leap_forward_desc:0 "Benjen Davirtannen and his technocratic allies have continued to promote modern, social-democratic policies, one of these including the nationalization of problematic and exploitative monopolies. To our benefit, there are numerous industrial monopolies across Chital, so much so that we can turn a blind eye to Davirtannen's own technological and electronic corporations."

 CTL_welfare_state:0 "The Chitali Safety Net"
 CTL_welfare_state_desc:0 "The world of today is one of hardship, poverty, and corruption. To alleviate these grand societal ills, Benjen V and Davirtannen have announced the birth of programs that will ensure Chital continues to provide its people with the resources they need to survive. No deer should live without the core tools for survival."
 
 CTL_the_public_private_synthesis:0 "Public-Private Synthesis"
 CTL_the_public_private_synthesis_desc:0 "The cost of neccessary infrastructure is a burden too intense for the treasury, and not profitable enough for private ventures. Through subsidies and government corporations we can find a good balance for Chital's future growth."

 CTL_davirtannens_influence:0 "Continue Davirtannen's Advisory"
 CTL_davirtannens_influence_desc:0 "The Yaril should not sideline the idealists entirely, but the transition to Equestrianism should best be left within the hooves of moderate reformists. Statesdeer who understand that policy is made through compromise, not a few beautiful speeches and some big ideas, are the advisors Benjen must embrace."

 CTL_bolster_the_technocrats:0 "Technocratic Guidance"
 CTL_bolster_the_technocrats_desc:0 "The elite of the country should included in building towards a new future. Experts earned their respectable positions for a reason after all, and can offer us their wisdom as we move past the old regime. This will replace the present system of activists and powerful groups demanding influence through leveraging wealth and political connections."

 CTL_an_olenian_bureaucracy:0 "Nobles Into Bureaucrats"
 CTL_an_olenian_bureaucracy_desc:0 "The old regime's reliance on nobles to lead the military and civil service was a product of a give-and-take system of power. For noble support, positions were given out like candy to landed deer. This has led to a situation where state policy is blocked in execution by entrenched nobles who have everything to gain by retaining the old system. They will be replaced, piece by piece, with civil servants loyal to the state itself."

 CTL_competent_advisors:0 "Sideline The Advisory Councils"
 CTL_competent_advisors_desc:0 "The old regime's several overlapping councils of advisors were a political tool to compromise with the elite. This is a situation Divirtannen cannot allow to continue. Katarina and Ninessen will have their powers 'adjusted' to sideline them from actual influence, while Eva Pillai will retain only the most basic engagement. They will be replaced with professional civil servants with faith in the future we are trying to build, and that will not block the path forward over reactionary ideals."

 CTL_katarina_choice:0 "Support The Progressives"
 CTL_katarina_choice_desc:0 "Would Princess Celestia lay down her vision of an equal and harmonious future to appease corrupt capitalists and traditionalist nobles? No! Then why should the Chitali? Such is the opinion of the court's progressives, chief among them the orator and writer Raili Ninessen - an idea Benjen should surely embrace."

 CTL_preach_tolerance:0 "Celestial Guidance"
 CTL_preach_tolerance_desc:0 "Equestrian harmony has brought stability and prosperity to a land of feuding pony tribes. If the Pegasi, Earth ponies, and Unicorns can unite, why not deer of different stripes? If we are to be united in tolerance and respect, we must look to Celestia's model and stand together in pursuit of friendship and an end to oppression - for a better world."

 CTL_fight_disharmony:0 "Defend Against Disharmony"
 CTL_fight_disharmony_desc:0 "As Ninnesen knows, in Equestria, as in Chital: Harmony is not an easy thing. In order to ensure the peace and prosperity of our new future we will need to prepare to defend it, with arms if necessary should diplomacy fail. We will ward against imperialism, communism, fascism and even the forces of unrestrained capital that threaten to undo our steps towards the future Chital deserves."

 CTL_establish_the_council_of_six:0 "Formalize the Council of Six"
 CTL_establish_the_council_of_six_desc:0 "Although they have been denied a voice in the Council of Seven for years, the Yaril's personal faction at court, known to the nobility as the "Council of Six", has aided in the advancement of his progressive agenda throughout his reign. Now that the Yaril has formally consolidated control over Chital, it is time to reward them with the respect they deserve."

 CTL_the_tools_of_chitali_democracy:0 "On Hira And Her Puppets"
 CTL_the_tools_of_chitali_democracy_desc:0 "Fake reports, intentional stirring of dissent, covert alliances with Southern traditionalists and socialist revolutionaries - and those are only some of Hira's crimes as spymistress! Our Yaril has been decieved since the moment he first appointed her to the Council, but now, things shall all be set right."

 CTL_keep_around_hoversholm:0 "Мир с республиканцами"
 CTL_keep_around_hoversholm_desc:0 "Страхи Ховерсхольма не оправдались. Традиционный роялизим и эквестрианизм не смогли победить в Читале. Возможно, такой исход покажется благоприятным для него и Шаха в Читале, и мы сможем убедить Ивара сложить оружие или вступить в демократическую оппозицию. Всяко лучше открытого мятежа."

 CTL_crush_the_communists:0 "Уроки Сталлионграда"
 CTL_crush_the_communists_desc:0 "Нельзя быть терпимым к нетерпимости.\nНеприятно признавать это, но республиканцы навроде Данньи Шах и Ивара Ховерсхольма только играют на копыто тайному советнику так же, как Сталлионград когда-то сыграл на копыто Чейнжлингам. Мы не авторитарны, и демократический суд будет проведён за их восстание. После этого, их ждёт честное наказание."

 CTL_civilization_to_the_south:0 "All Together Now"
 CTL_civilization_to_the_south_desc:0 "The painful transition from the old to the new has proven unpopular, in some ways understandbly so, to certain elements of society. Intense propaganda and policing measures will curtail resentment until reforms can be complete."

 CTL_ostracize_the_seers:0 "Sweep Aside The Godi"
 CTL_ostracize_the_seers_desc:0 "The 'wisdom' of the Seers were often used as an excuse to justify policy by the old regime, something that has left the Godi with considerable power. This will end, their place in the state is over. This will exacerbate the governments unpopularity to certain deer, in the immediate term, but it is an inevitable bridge that must be crossed."

 CTL_the_democracy_plan:0 "Four Steps To Democracy"
 CTL_the_democracy_plan_desc:0 "Democracy has four pillars, and we must aspire to them all. Firstly, we will look to Equestrian Harmony and apply it to Chital's values. We will secularize society, and remove the Godi's powers in the state. We will ensure Justice is equal to all citizens, and we will ensure all are treated with Kindness as equals. This is the future Chital has aspired to, and what we will deliver."

 CTL_the_secular_agenda:0 "For A Secular Chital"
 CTL_the_secular_agenda_desc:0 "With the Godi's influence in government limited, it's time to truly remove their influence from all parts of society. Schooling will have to be adjusted, as will public services and the land-wealth they have acquired. Finally, Chital will be a truly secular society free of the interference of the Seers. Citizens will be free to pursue their faith, native or Olenian or otherwise."

 CTL_benjens_brand_of_justice:0 "Benjen's Brand Of Justice"
 CTL_benjens_brand_of_justice_desc:0 "Fascists and communists continue to abuse our notions of harmony and democracy to subvert our steps to a new future.

 CTL_benjen_secret_police:0 "Democracy's Secret Agents"
 CTL_benjen_secret_police_desc:0 "Hira may have been a traitor and a fascist, but she was also an adept spy. Without her, our ability to conduct intelligence operations is extremely lacking and leaves us vulnerable.

 CTL_the_kungliga_riksdagen:0 "Establish the Kungliga Riksdagen"
 CTL_the_kungliga_riksdagen_desc:0 "Finally, it is time to establish the structure we have been building the foundation for. This new parliament is Davirtannen's final step, and with his guidance as Chief Minister we will finally step into the future Chital needs. Benjen will remain as a respected figure to guide society, while the state and policy is led by Divirtannen and the ministerial technocrats he has appointed to advise."
 
 CTL_the_yaril_and_his_mayors:0 "Yaril of Chital, Prince of Harmony"
 CTL_the_yaril_and_his_mayors_desc:0 "Ninessan's vision is for an Equestrian system, one where power is devolved to the local level while the Yaril-Prince of Chital guides society and drives the nation as a whole. With this structure atop the foundation we have built, Chital will enter into the future vision that seemed almost a dream not so long ago. It will be a future of secularity and democracy, one looking to harmonist principles where all citizens and creatures will have a say under the Prince of Harmony.
 
 CTL_a_new_cultural_assimilation:0 "A New Cultural Assimilation"
 CTL_a_new_cultural_assimilation_desc:0 "As expected, certain local demographics are reacting with paranoia and reactionary thought as we transition into Chitalian Harmony. It will take great effort but between police efforts, propaganda, and education we will convince those who can be that this future benefits us all. Should education and tolerance fail, police action to root out agitation and ensure stability against these reactionary groups is well within the ideals of justice for all."

 CTL_the_old_advisor_desc:0 "The time for reform is over. With the Council and people rallying behind Jakob the Grey, the traditionalists now have a clear mandate to save Chital.

 CTL_the_eastern_generals:0 "Warriors of the East"
 CTL_the_eastern_generals_desc:0 "Generals Huddarden and Westfelt, along with their military suppliers in House Gadra, are the main loyalists to Jakob the Grey within the military. Although our Yaril may take issue to such extremist officers being appointed to key positions in government and civil service, it is clear that to consolidate Jakob's control, the loyalties of his supporters must be rewarded."

 CTL_speak_with_benjen:0 "Speak With Benjen"
 CTL_speak_with_benjen_desc:0 "Benjen is unhappy with many of the figures Jakob surrounds himself with, and has openly opposed Chitali traditionalism ever since he replaced the advisory council of Aatto with the Council of Seven. Jakob shall speak with the Yaril, and make sure he is happy with the state of our government."

 CTL_purge_the_axis:0 "Wiping Away the Stain"
 CTL_purge_the_axis_desc:0 "Hira Ramachan and Bhushan Gurat have done nothing in the past decade but subvert our government, scheme in the shadows, and attack all good-natured loyalists to the Yaril, whether they be reformist or traditionalist! Although Hira is simply an incompetent charlatan, Bhushan is much more dangerous - and as a result must be eliminated."

 CTL_chital_lives_and_dies_with_benjen:0 "Chital Lives And Dies With Benjen!"
 CTL_chital_lives_and_dies_with_benjen_desc:0 "The Kudlinens have ruled for centuries - never would Jakob think of removing their ancestral hold to power out of some blind anti-progressive rage.

 CTL_liberating_the_yaril_from_himself:0 "Liberating Benjen From Himself"
 CTL_liberating_the_yaril_from_himself_desc:0 "The Yaril is too far gone.

CTL_export_our_labor_force_desc:0 "Chital has no shortage of workers; we are a hard-working deer with a history of effort and quality in everything we make but the distractions of a developing modern world can often get on top of things.

CTL_sugar_spice:0 "The Spice Must Flow"
CTL_sugar_spice_desc:0 "Wars have been fought over spices, lands traded between noble families and nations just to get that little bit closer to the source; chital is the source. Though the need for spices has reduced with refrigeration, the demand has only risen and the amount of bits to be made is eyewatering. By expanding our farms, we can meet this rising demand and reap the rewards as money flows into our nation."

CTL_a_great_individualist_spirit:0 "A Culture of Consumption"
CTL_a_great_individualist_spirit_desc:0 "Chital's traditions and culture are beginning to slow down our development; living a simple, humble life is a noble idea but it doesn't make for a dynamic economy in the modern world.

CTL_walking_on_tightrope:0 "Walking the Tightrope"
CTL_walking_on_tightrope_desc:0 "There is no denying, religion is a sensitive issue within Chital and must be treated delicately as there are groups with considerable influence aligned to the various religions, the Tuya being the most prominent.

A new approach is needed, a cultural synchronous so me can move forward as one united deer."

CTL_purge_the_tuya:0 "Terrorize the Tuya"
CTL_purge_the_tuya_desc:0 "The Tuya must go. Monks armed with guns, wondering around the countryside spouting their faith and stirring up divisions will only end in disaster for us.

 CTL_native_resistance_desc:0 "With support for radical movements exacerbated by the modern movements for harmony, natural rights, and independence throughout the world, the native Chitalis have grown discontent with the current government of Benjen V and the Council of Seven. Many of the natives have begun a policy of complete opposition to the Oleno-Hindian native landed elite, who they believe do not truly represent the people of Chital. If the goverment does not deal with these newfound native tensions quickly, then it could have a crisis on its hooves. With growing support for the Hindian nobility faction in the Council of Seven, the Axis of Chital, along with an increase in militant leftist and republican activity, often sponsored by these same nobles, it is imperative that our government restore balance to Chital, before the Yarildom is swept away by internal turmoil."

Committed to anti-government politics and a desire to change Chital for the better, the Axis supports strengthening Hindian positions and fixing the disparity in power between the landed Oleno-Hindian elite and the commondeer. Given seats on the Council of Seven during the first years of Benjen's reign, the Axis has continued to be a thorn in the monarchy's side, even supporting republican movements at points to sabotage the rule of House Kudlinen. If we ever are to reform Chital, we must first deal with these pompous "champions of the people"."

If we are to truly heal our relationship with the inland Hindians, we should first focus on developing their lands back to modern standards.

 ###ADVISORS###
 CTL_seer_advisor:0 "Dreia of Lavborg"
 CTL_seer_advisor_desc:0 "Dreia of Lavborg, often called the Laughing Priest for his bucking of many ritualistic trends in favor of an accomodating view of the Pantheon and the recruitment of new worshippers, has served as the de-facto second in command of the followers of Ukko in Chital for years. Although they have sparred on theological matters numerous times before, Dreia remains a loyal disciple of Konnar, the leader of the Pantheon's worshippers in Chital, and along with the native Caarlit Lawas, has helped bolster the outreach of the Olenian Gods throughout skeptic urban communities and zealous native ones."
 CTL_noble_advisor1:0 "Andreas Savannen"
 CTL_noble_advisor1_desc:0 "Andreas Savannen has served as a personal aide and advisor to chairdeer of the RMEC Benjen Davirtannen for as long as many Chitali can remember. Considered to be just as intelligent if not more so than his mentor, Savannen has paradoxically made a name for himself as a particularly skilled faceless bureaucrat with little prominent political and social leanings. Unlike Davirtannen, he has kept out of courtly politics, but personally, he holds significant sympathy for the causes of the disgraced Ivar Hoversholm and his mentor both, along with disdain for the scheming nobility of the Ostkranbi."
 CTL_noble_advisor2:0 "Tuomas the Quiet"
 CTL_noble_advisor2_desc:0 "Known for an almost-ritualistic silent nature, Tuomas the Quiet came to court with his good friend and fellow Fraskali noble, Elik Baronnen, but has now become a mind completely of his own. A ruthless enforcer with a habit for cruel and unusual punishment, Tuomas' strength does not lie in his haggard, shadowy appearance, which inspires fear into little, but instead his eerie demeanour and utter disregard for the international codes of harmony."
 CTL_noble_advisor3:0 "Caarlit Samara"
 CTL_noble_advisor3_desc:0 "A bumbling steward and personal confidante of Eva Pillai, Caarlit Samara lies out of place in the Chitali capital. His Oleno-Hindian demeanour, straight from Gondeerana, still carries a lingering effect on his personality that his largely dissipated from Eva's, and as a result, he knows little allies but his old comrade. A competent ally, Samara has served as Eva's eyes and ears in areas the powerful advisor is unlikely to tread."
 CTL_business_advisor1:0 "Ajit Rashigas"
 CTL_business_advisor1_desc:0 "Ajit Rashigas, a business and entrepreneurial mind from the West of Chital, serves as the civilian portion of the Rashigas twins' operations in Chital. Ajit, weaker but more intelligent than his brother, has expressed sympathy and solidarity for Benjen V, Ivar Hoversholm, and Jakob the Grey, with disdain for the methods of the Axis and the percieved "elitism" of Eva Pillai and Davirtannen. A populist sympathizer, Rashigas remains a political wild-card, but would surely find himself at home in most any non-Axis administration."
 CTL_business_advisor2:0 "Gurunath Rashigas"
 CTL_business_advisor2_desc:0 "Gurunath Rashigas, a business and military mind from the West of Chital, serves as the military portion of the Rashigas twins' operations in Chital. Gurunath, stouter and stronger than his brother, is an ally of Ivar Hoversholm within the court, but surprisingly, he has also been seen as a key potential ally of Jakob the Grey. Rashigas, having served as an aide to Hoversholm but collaborator to Jakob in military operations, is a political wild-card, but like his brother, remains independent."
 CTL_military_advisor1:0 "Jashiv Frawar"
 CTL_military_advisor1_desc:0 "Jashiv Frawar is yet another native ally of Jakob the Grey, a position many would believe to be an oxymoron. Frawar, a young "New Noble", has been appointed to numerous bureaucratic and military posts throughout his time in Ostkranbi as part of Benjen V's relentless reshuffling and reform efforts. Paranoid, and known for controversial statements in support of the far-right, Frawar would be an easy ally for Jakob the Grey among Benjen's inner circle, as part of a youth and native faction unlikely to normally support traditionalist politics."
 CTL_military_advisor2:0 "Grasya Kahnli"
 CTL_military_advisor2_desc:0 "Grasya Kahnli, the young commoner wife of industrialist and socialite Wasil Kahnli, has risen from a young, relatively modest courtier in Kahnli's own domain to become one of the most powerful does in Ostkranbi. An ally to Hira Ramachan, Eva Pillai, and her own husband, Grasya is known for her appetite for courtly intrigue and lavish parties and gatherings, which although gratifying to the former commoner, mostly serve as a honeypot for various nobles to spill their secrets to an Axis spy... or for said Axis spies to connect."

Элик нередко выступает как критик нынешнего правительства, или как верный сторонник Бенджена — в зависимости от того, что ему выгодней; в целом он симпатизирует Читальской Оси, не вступая в прямую оппозицию с программой прежнего ярила. Считается, что внутри самой Оси Бароннен придерживается умеренно-консервативного курса, поддерживая фракции Рамачан и Ховерсхольма, а уж его неприязнь ко Бхушану и Кахнли известна всем."
 CTL_da_twink:0 "Васил Кахнли"
 CTL_da_twink_desc:0 "Несмотря на сомнительное происхождение и невысокий княжеский титул, молодой и импульсивный Васил Кахнли сумел подняться на важный пост советника при дворце в Осткранби — не в последнюю очередь благодаря покровительству Евы Пиллаи. Кахнли умеет расположить оленя к себе, за что и нашёл себе политический приют во фракции Пиллаи, среди рыночников и сторонников Читальской Оси. Васил считается хорошим другом Евы и тайного советника Хиры, противником ярильских реформ, а уж к Элику Бароннену, другому придворному индустриальному магнату, некогда ключевому союзнику при дворе, у Кахнли столь же мало симпатии, сколь и ко всякого рода экстремистам."
 CTL_hira_advisor:0 "Hira Ramachan"
 CTL_hira_advisor_desc:0 "Hira Ramachan, born a minor noble to the small Mayor of Haarihus, was plucked from relative obscurity to serve at the court of Benjen V as Chital's spymaster and premier intelligence authority. None can doubt her prowess and skill at finding secrets, even if sometimes they are ones the government would best have kept under wraps themselves... of course, if the government is similarly aligned with her pro-native, reformist interests, they will have nothing to fear."
 CTL_non_hira_advisor:0 "Anders Snier"
 CTL_non_hira_advisor_desc:0 "A bumbling bureaucrat, Anders Snier is not exactly one's first choice to take over the intelligence apparatus left by Hira Ramachan, but he is perhaps the only candidate willing and able, with much of Hira's once-strong connections across Chital no longer in the hands of the government. Hopefully, such a bumbling bureaucrat with a taste for starry-eyed reformism can truly bring something to Chital's growing intelligence network."

chital.1.t:0 "Открытие сезона Мунпани"
chital.1.d:0 "— ...И ты правда намерен нести весь этот вздор, все эти твои телячьи фантазии на правительственном выступлении? Я-то надеялся, что после нашего с тобой разговора по душам ты хоть что-то понял!\n\nСтарый олень взохнул и с досадой покачал головой на Ярила; и без того хмурый его вид подчёркивала масса морщин и шрамов на лице. \"Делать мне больше нечего, — думал тот про себя, — кроме как разъезжать из самой Гондираны в Оскранби ради очередной королевской речи! С войсковых смотров, с военных учений — к ярилу, моему племянничку, в который раз несущему свою нелепицу про «жизненные условия», «устаревшие сословия» и прочие пустословия.\"\n\n— По-твоему это «телячьи фантазии»? Дядя Якоб, ты просто не понимаешь всю серьёзность сложившейся ситуации, — ответил раздражённый Бенджен. Мешки под глазами выдавали в нём недостаток сна — и терпения — после того, как он целую ночь писал и репетировал своё выступление, — наше ярслтво находится в столь тяжёлом положении, что мы больше не можем стоять спиной к коренным хиндийцам, к их нужде! Если мы не займёмся за дело, если мы не дадим хлеба беднякам и голос...\n\n— Голос этим мятежным туземцам и их политикам-выскочкам! С твоими мягкотелыми идеями! — Якоб повысил свой голос на ярила. — Бенджен, твой отец обрушил бы на них свою секиру, и то же сделал бы отец твоего отца. Твоя речь подействует как масло в огонь и лишь раззадорит всех этих радикальных демагогов, если она не подтвердит нашу верность национальной мощи, традициям и единству.\n\nБенджен вздохнул и опустил взгляд на текст своей речи, над которым он так кропотливо трудился всю ночь. Якоб был твёрд как скала, когда дело касалось его убеждений, и хотя ярил всё ещё хотел помочь своим подданным, его дядя, возможно, был прав насчёт надёжности национальных традиций. Наконец, Бенджен поднял голову и произнёс:"

chital.2.t:0 ""A New Dawn Is Rising""
chital.2.d:0 "As Benjen entered the council chambers he felt the weight of responsibility on his shoulders, a familiar sensation if one that he had tried to avoid for most of his life. It had sat uneasy, unfamiliar, and more often than not unwelcome and today, today was no different. He had a task ahead of him which, despite his instincts, he had fixed his purpose on. Like a deer resigned to a fate they did not desire, he had set himself to his task.\n\nTaking his place at the head of the councillor's table he greeted each of them in turn. Eva and Davirtannen smiled warmly accepting his welcome. Jakob nodded in encouragement, a hint of pride in his gaze. Hira returned his greeting with the watchful thoughtfulness she was known for. Ivar looked eager to rise and give a greeting of his own but the deer was smart enough to know that right belonged to Benjen. Bhushan accepted the greeting with a nod, ever the warrior monk ready for a fight. Taking a breath to steady himself Benjen, Vth of his name, began.\n\n"Councillors, It is good to see you all again. I have been giving the current state of Chital a great deal of thought since our last meeting and I am now ready to share with you all my new grand design, The unification of Chital. For too long we allowed ourselves to bend to the whims of traitors, terrorists and instigators who seek to divide us. We have been kind, we have been fair, we have tried to help them and they have spat in our face." Bhushan grunted disapprovingly. "That is all going to change. It is time we end the threat at our doors once and for all. We will make every loyal deer feel safe in their homes, protected and guarded against those who would destroy our traditions. A massive effort is needed with the deployment of troops and the agents of the state. I will need each voice round this table to help me in this but we must be of one mind. You all have your unique talents which can be brought to bear in this united effort. If we are to protect our deer, our livelihoods and our country we must crush these dissidents with such force that no others will ever raise their voice against us again."\n\nFinishing with a grave scowl Benjen regarded his fellow councillors once again. Davirtannen looked horrified while Eva seemed deeply conflicted. Hira appeared relaxed but disapproving, her eyes watching the others closely. Ivar appeared to be trying to figure out what to make of it. Worst of all Bhushan looked ready for a fight, veins in his neck bulging as he glared daggers at Benjen. The only one round the table who appeared to approve was Jakob, who sat up just that bit straighter than before a slight smile on his lips to reassure Benjen."
chital.2.a:0 "A bit harsh, don't you think?"

chital.3.t:0 ""Hoof Holding Hoof""
chital.3.d:0 "As Benjen entered the council chambers he felt the weight of responsibility on his shoulders, a familiar sensation if one that he had tried to avoid for most of his life till now. It had sat uneasy, unfamiliar, and more often than not unwelcome but today, today was different. He had a task ahead of him to which he had fixed his purpose and, for perhaps the first time in his life, he welcomed the responsibility for it gave him a chance to do something worthwhile.\n\nTaking his place at the head of the councillor's table he greeted each of them in turn. Eva and Davirtannen smiled warmly accepting his welcome. Jakob nodded curtly, refusing to meet his eye. Hira returned his greeting with the watchful thoughtfulness she was known for. Ivar looked eager to rise and give a greeting of his own but the deer was smart enough to know that right belonged to Benjen. Bhushan accepted the greeting with a nod, ever the warrior monk ready for a fight. Taking a breath to steady himself Benjen, Vth of his name, began.\n\n"Councillors, It is good to see you all again. I have been giving the current state of Chital a great deal of thought since our last meeting and I am now ready to share with you all my new grand design, the harmony of the masses. Chital has been divided for too long and whilst struggling against its own confused identity hostility has festered. There are deer who do not feel welcome in our nation." Bhushan grunted in acknowledgement. "That is all going to change. It is time we throw open the doors and make every deer feel they can have a home here, be accepted here, be welcomed for who they are. A massive reform is needed. A reform of the classes, a reform of the economy. I will need each voice round this table to help me in this, for your opinions and views on this matter are unique. You each see the problems in a different way and if we're to hear the voices of our deer we must first hear the voices of each other. So let us listen, let us try to understand and start making Chital a better place for all."\n\nFinishing with a smile Benjen regarded his fellow councillors once again. Davirtannen practically beamed while Eva certainly seemed to approve of the message. Hira appeared relaxed and happy. Ivar stomped his hoof in agreement. Even Bhushan looked interested, one eyebrow raised quizzically as he returned Benjen' s gaze. The only one round the table who appeared downcast was Jakob who looked even more annoyed than before. The old soldier raised his head and spoke."
chital.3.a:0 "Could you get any more sappier?"

chital.4.t:0 "A Council For Four"
chital.4.d:0 ""They cannot be trusted." Jakob slammed his hoof down on the table. "Why they're even on the council I cannot understand. Forming into their little 3 deer team, calling themselves the Axis, they're conniving, scheming and paranoid."\n"Of course they're paranoid, we're plotting against them. We meet without them to take decisions that affect them, their provinces, and their deer. Are you really so thick-headed you can't see why they're annoyed, why they feel the need to band together just like we have?" Eva returned a salvo of her own from the other end of the table.\n"Perhaps if they showed a bit more gratitude for their positions they'd be included more. Their loyalty and duty should be too Chital, they should be honoured to be allowed to speak not grumbling about their complaints being ignored. Look at Davirtannen, he wouldn't go about sneaking and plotting would he?"\n"Don't drag me into this." The industrialist added from his chair - his attempts to go unnoticed clearly hadn't worked.\n\n"Don't be an old fool Jakob, the only way we can move this body forward is if we start to work together not plot behind closed doors and hurl insults at each other. Put yourself in their hooves" Eva continued.\n"I am not in their hooves; I am in my hooves. I see things the way they are, not clouded by some vision of the future that doesn't exist right now. Wake up Eva or are you just a coward?" Jakob spat back.\n\n"Enough!" Benjen Vth shouted. "Enough of this both of you, I will not listen to any more of your bickering. Go, you both need to cool off." Eva and Jakob sat motionless, staring death at each other. "Go! Now!" The force of his demand shook both of them from their feud. Pausing only to bow to Benjen on their way out, the two stormed from the room, slamming doors as they went\n"Well, that was heated." Benjen sighed, head in hooves. "Thanks to all of that I've forgotten what we were discussing. What was this meeting even meant to be about?"\n"The reforms Yaril." Davirtannen offered.\n"Ah yes, your proposed reforms." Benjen visibly brightened. "Well, I'm sure we can handle those just the two of us, we agree on most points anyway, correct?"\n"Indeed we do Yaril, shall we begin?""
chital.4.a:0 "An excellent agenda."

chital.5.t:0 "News From The South"
chital.5.d:0 "Eva poured over the reports, her concern growing with every new page, paragraph, and sentence. What started out as a minor incident in a corner of the Yarildom had grown into the very real threat of a communist rising across several provinces. This figure, Dannya Shah, had manage to turn a handful of discontent farmers into a militia that was doing considerable damage. Reports of blown trainlines, kidnappings, gunrunning and extorsion were becoming more frequent. The fragile economy was beginning to suffer and so her advice had been requested. She couldn't understand it. They hadn't issued any demands, made any statements about their intent other than to call themselves communists, they acted more like a gang than a political army running around causing all kinds of problems without any real drive.\n\nThey'd arrive in a region, Dannya would give a few speeches, rally some support then they'd sabotage something and move on. Round and round the provinces they went; Mahorna, Haarihus and Gondeerana had suffered but worse still was the implications of this tactic. Keeping up momentum like that requires more than just charisma and drive, it requires bits. Some outside agency was supplying the rebels with money and equipment, she was sure of it. With the current supply shortages of the army every gun and bullet was tracked and accounted for, the weapons had to be coming from somewhere else. The Doelhi confederacy was a possible source, they'd welcome a chance to destabilise the Yarildom, or perhaps it was Sambar, their border disputes went back a long way. There had to be someone who knew something about this, perhaps Caarlit Samara, her steward and confidante could help, he always had an ear to the ground. Hira was also sure to have some information about what was going on, with her help they could get to the bottom of the issue. It would also be a nice gesture to reach out between council members for support. Either way this needed to get fixed, and fast."
chital.5.a:0 "That is certainly worse than we thought."

chital.6.t:0 "Reaching The South"
chital.6.d:0 "The brief was simple, get supplies and troops to Mahorna to help deal with the unrest in the area, but even this had gotten political. Benjen and Jakob had been discussing it for close to an hour as they walked around the grounds of the white tower; the quickest route would take the convoy through Ditar, Bhushan's territory, Axis lands. Jakob took against this plan, arguing that the convoys should be routed through Gondeerana, Eva's lands, instead.\n\n"It will add days to their travel time." Benjen reiterated "There are deer suffering now, we need to help them. How many lives will we lose because of that delay? I cannot have that on my consciousness, it's heartless."\n"Benjen, it is better to be heartless than mindless. The history of the world is the story of the triumph of the heartless over the mindless. By routing through Gondeerana we guarantee the security of our forces. We cannot account for ambushes in Ditar and knowing Bhushan he'd place the lunatic sister of his, Marsha, in charge of the security and if the convoy is compromised it cannot help anyone. How many lives would be lost then?" The discussion swung back and forwards around this point but there was no hostility in the debate, both deer took it as a chance to educate the other. Benjen sought demonstrate the value of trust to Jakob while, in return, Jakob took the opportunity to educate Benjen on military strategy.\n\n"Bhushan's local forces can protect the trunks as they travel, he's a fighter and will know what is required. By trusting his skills, we can engage with the militias all sooner and reassure him of our faith in him."\n"Combat is not a matter of faith, you do not have faith that your enemy is weaker than you, you gain information, prepare, practice and train, you have to rely upon your own strengths. I have no doubts about Bhushan's abilities, but these are our troops, we should be the ones protecting them as they protect the civilians. It's about morale as much as transport."\n"Hmm, this is harder than I thought it would be." Benjen pondered, scratching his chin. He took a deep breath of the evening air to clear his thoughts.\n"That's why I'm here to help. From such small decisions are wars lost and won but know, whichever you go with I will support." Jakob patted his shoulder reassuringly."
chital.6.a:0 "The Axis's supply lines will protect us."
chital.6.b:0 "Reroute supplies through Pillai lands."

chital.7.t:0 "Her Final Fortress"
chital.7.d:0 "Jakob pushed his way into the command tent, the sounds of distant gunfire in the jungle dwindling as the last of the fighting ceased. Within the tent officers congratulated each other on a job well done, Dannya shah captured, her stronghold broken, her forces scattered. This was a great day for the Chital, but the work was only just beginning. On the far side of the tent, the remainder of the council of 4 awaited his return. As he crossed to them, setting his rifle down on the table, Benjen addressed him.\n\n"General Huddarnen has informed us of Shah's capture but there's a problem, most of her forces have fled into the jungle. If they get away there's a chance they'll reform and come back in strength, if we want to go after them, we'll have to do it now before they can escape."\n"We should-"\n"Go after them now." Davirtannen cut Jakob off. "If we capture them, it will stabilise the region and we can turn a new page on this sorry saga. Let the criminals serve their time and we'll move on with better things." Jakob, surprised at Davirtannen's boldness and his plan to pursue the rebels, composed himself.\n"I agree that we need to go after them but to make examples of them. There are other strongholds out there to clear up and no one will believe they've genuinely reformed. An enemy beaten is still an enemy, we need to eliminate them."\n"You think making martyrs of these deer is going to help us?" Eva interjected, a fierce glint in her eye aimed at Jakob. "Let them go, our priority is the locals, those injured in the fighting, those who've suffered under the attacks. If we show them kindness, they'll know the rebels were fighting for a false cause and most of them will slink back to their villages and not trouble us again." General Huddarnen, an old ally of Jakob's, approached the table once more.\n\n"Yaril, I need an order. It's now or never.""
chital.7.a:0 "Pursue a ruthless assault on remaining CPLF strongholds."
chital.7.b:0 "Imprison them - we must appear strong but fair."
chital.7.c:0 "Focus on reconciliation with native groups."

chital.8.t:0 "Следствие ведут короли..."
chital.8.d:0 "Бенджен сидел в своём рабочем кабинете, в глубине цитадели крепости Белой башни, зажёг свечу — её тёплый огонёк усмирял дрожь в копытах, держащих письмо. Содержание письма, скреплённого вишнёво-красной сургучовой печатью Данньи Шах, могло привнести мир во всём государстве. Ярил открыл его и стал читать...\n\n"Госпоже Читальской тени,\n\nВаше самолюбие начинает одерживать над вами верх, попрошу вас предостеречься от слежки за любыми моими действиями, иначе поставите наше дело под угрозу.\n\nХоть я и благодарна за поставку оружия, ярил чуть было не нашёл его. Не сегодня-завтра мы завладеем югом и свергнем "Доброго Викинга".\n\nНо коль скоро этот день наступит, нам следует поработать над деталями нашей кооперации; иначе революция на династии Бенджена не остановится.\n\nС наилучшими пожеланиями, Даннья Шах"\n\nБенджен поморгал, затем перечитал заново. Кто в своём уме стал бы писать подобное? По смыслу это явно сообщение союзнику, но тогда к чему эти едва прикрытые угрозы? К тому же разговоры о "читальской тени" заставили ярила нервничать, пускай письмо и показалось ему довольно забавным — до чего интересная личность его писала!\n\nТолько вот кому? Кто поставлял оружие мятежникам? Погодите-ка... госпожа Читальская тень...\n"Неужто Хира?" — подумал про себя Бенджен. Повернувшись к кровати у своего стола, он сказал лежавшей под одеялом оленихе:\n— Руусу, дорогая моя, не могла бы ты сходить за сотрудником королевской полиции?\n\nОтветом было лишь сонное ворчание. "Видимо, мне придётся сходить самому, — подумал Бенджен, — однако стоит ли так рисковать?""
chital.8.a:0 "Не стоит копать слишком глубоко. Да и какая тут может быть связь с Осью?"
chital.8.b:0 "Я должен принять меры."

chital.9.t:0 "The State of the Seven"
chital.9.d:0 "Benjen relaxed into the chair on the balcony overlooking the sea, his shoulders sagging under the weariness of the day; arguments amongst the council had turned a half hour meeting into a two hour one. Small details and the choice words causing flare ups, it didn't matter that they were all saying the same thing just in different ways, it was like they wanted a fight, they came into the meeting expecting conflict, just like yesterday and the day before. He needed to find something to united them but that was another problem half the time. They knew what needed to be done and agreed upon the goals, the path to those goals was where the issues lay, the demons in the details. He'd never seen people argue so much even though they all agreed with each other, wouldn't it be so much easier if he could just put to sea in a boat and ride the waves instead.\n\n"Gods I hate politics." He groaned.\n\n"How are you holding up?" she asked, setting a glass of water on the table next to him. He took a deep breath of the evening air and steadied himself.\n\n"I'll manage. We finalised the agreement of equal education rights so that's something at least, even if it did take all afternoon."\n\n"You've been working too hard recently, how about we go away for the weekend, just the two of us, no late-night meetings, no reviewing documents or issuing statements. A little relaxing getaway will do you a world of good."\n\n"Where would I be without you?" He sighed and laid his head on her shoulder.\n\n"Probably in another council meeting. " She chuckled. "So, tell me, how did it go?""
chital.9.a:0 "Unstable, but beneficial."

chital.10.t:0 "A Meeting With The Godi"
chital.10.d:0 ""Tell me Yaril, when was the last time you listened to the gods?" The old godi walked at Benjen's side; the air was blessedly crisp and warm this evening, sun setting behind the white tower as they strolled through the grounds.\n"Prayer is not really my thing Konnar." Benjen replied in a placating tone. Konnar chuckled, crown of raven feathers rustling against his antlers.\n"Nor mine but that's not what I asked. Those who rule above us will do what they will, prayer or no prayer but when was the last time you listened, sat and heard what they had to say."\n\n"I... I don't follow." Benjen stopped, confusion written across his face, he turned his full attention to Konnar.\n"Well, think of it like this. Everydeer wants something, even the gods, but sifting through them nonsense and hyperbole, to hear what they're really saying, that's the trick."\n"You're making them sound like politicians." Benjen laughed.\n"Now you're hearing my truth." He smiled. Glancing over the Yaril's shoulder he saw Katarina, Ivar's sister, cross the gardens toward the tower. She smiled and waved at them as she went. Konnar return the gesture. "Do you listen to the truth the ‘gods' are saying. Do you grasp what they want?"\n\nBenjen watched Katarina as she went.\n"I think so, I just... can't decide who to listen to."\n"I'm not here to tell you what's important, I'm not a missionary. I want you to ask yourself what is most important to you. I cannot make these decisions for you but the wisdom of the godi is yours should you wish it; all I ask is that you hear what we have to say.""
chital.10.a:0 "Indeed, the wisdom of the godi should always be heeded."
chital.10.b:0 "No, we cannot be seen to favour one religious group over another."

chital.11.t:0 "Bhushan's Proposal"
chital.11.d:0 "The council chamber emptied out, Davirtannen having a quiet word with Ivar as they departed, haggling over tariffs rates no doubt. Benjen gathered his papers, satisfied after another meeting; things seemed to be getting easier these days, he'd really gotten his hooves on managing each session.\n\n"Benjen, may I have a word?" Bhushan stood at the Yaril's shoulder, his expression the standard indifference that gave little anyway.\n"Certainly, though can we be quick, I have dinner arrangements." The Yaril placed his papers in his saddlebag.\n"Tuymaiyānatu." Benjen signed and bowed his head, straight to the point as normal, this was not going to be fun conversation. "Legitimise them." a statement, not a request.\n"Bhushan, you know we ca-"\n"It is to your benefit.

This is clearly a conflict of interests; you're the head of that order are you not?"\n"That matters little. They would be placed under the instruction of the council. You cannot deny their usefulness."\n"I'm not denying anything, I'm merely saying that legitimising the Tuya would cause disruption we cannot afford."\n"Yaril I believe you are mistaken, it will save disruption in the long term by increasing our reach and placating a group which would otherwise feel excluded and victimised, even you must see the benefits to keeping the peace.""

If I gave you the job of managing industrial output say, what's to stop you settling old scores against Davirtannen's factories, or him getting paranoid and subverting you, it goes both ways you see."\n\n"So you're saying you cannot trust me because no-one else trusts me?" She raised an eyebrow at that. Benjen had decided to invite Hira to a private brunch, just the two of them in his quarters. He had hoped that a relaxed, comfortable atmosphere, a couple of friends breaking bread together, would produce a good discussion and help to bridge the gap in the council. He'd forgotten that Hira never relaxed, always on watch, always inspecting her surroundings, eyeing the doors and windows cautiously as she spread marmalade on her toast, the spymistress through and through.\n\n"No that's not what I mean. I do trust you as you know, I'm trying to think of how we can build relations with Davirtannen, Eva and Jakob. If you could trust each other we could get so much positive work done you see."\n\n"Benjen, I don't think you quite understand where I'm coming from. Myself, Bhushan and Ivar have been repeatedly excluded from discussions that affect us, our provinces, our deer and with which we can help. Our voices carry less weight in the meetings we do attend, our advice is overlooked, and our activities relegated to unimportant matters. Look at the work we do; Jakob controls the army, Davirtannen oversees industry and Eva plans the economy and manages the budget. I'm in charge of information in a country with poor communications infrastructure, Bhushan oversees religion in a country with religious freedom and Ivar is just, kind of, there. You see how that doesn't compare correct?"\n\n"Yes, I can see why you might feel a bit... bitter about things when you put it like that."\n\n"Bitter? I'm not bitter Benjen. Bhushan is bitter, Ivar is hopeful, I'm just tired. Why should I be the first to make some offering of peace to the others, I have done nothing save what was asked of me, I did it well and I am still expected to kowtow. If you want an offering of peace ask Jakob. Those with little should not have to beg from those with lots, it's not right, as well you know. I give you my word I will only act with Chital's best interests in mind but if you want to bridge the gap in the council the work has to begin from the other side." She sipped her tea calmly."

Benjen passed the minotaur a glass of whiskey before settling himself into his own chair, after a long and rather dull meeting which had mostly been used by the various other council members to try and sweet talk Andrea, he just wanted a moment's peace. When the motion to add another member to the council had been proposed they'd all thought he was mad to offer the position to Andreas, the minotaur was a general not a politician, but that was exactly why he'd been picked. He had no prior allegiances to any of the little cliques and factions within the council, he'd been overlooked, thought of as unimportant and so would be impartial. To top that off a lifetime in the army had taught the old bull the ins and outs of administration as well as navigating the political currents, the army was not immune to cliques themselves after all.\n\n"I'll need a bigger chair. I got stuck in the one at the council chamber, they're made for deer not minotaurs."

Even before my appointment was made general knowledge, I'd had dinner invites from Ivar, tickets to a gala with Eva, drinks in the officer's mess with Jakob and a promise of some weapons factory tours with Davirtannen; they're all playing their own games, trying to pull me to their sides. It's been getting so bad recently I was considering calling in a few artillery strikes just to make a point. The only one who hasn't been trying to get a favour is you Benjen, now that's interesting in and of itself. Waiting for your moment to strike? A glass of whiskey in a comfortable office maybe?" He gestured to the room around them as he sipped his drink. "Let's be frank Benjen. What's wrong angle, what do you get out of this?"\n"Balance, Andreas. I get balance, on the council and in the backroom deals. All I ask is that you help me in this, tip the scales a bit."\n"And who would you have me support?" He held out his glass for a refill.

At least, that's what the portrait portrayed; the reality was somewhat different. His neck hurt from posing, his back ached from standing all morning, the cloak was heavy and hot, he just wanted a cup of tea and a sit down. The whole thing was a farce, but he could hear Jakob's word echoing A royal procession will require a royal portrait.\n\n"Finished?" Jakob called as he entered the room.\n\n"Just about." The artist finished with a flourish "There we are Yaril, tell me what you think." Benjen sagged, a sigh of relief slipping out as he stepped off the dais letting his cloak fall to the floor, his back creaking like a rusty cement mixer as he came to stand next to Jakob and view the portrait. The old soldier looked very pleased, Benjen not so much.\n\n"It doesn't look a thing like me."\n\n"That's the point. It's not about what you look like, it's about what you can become, the making of a new deer, an image to be passed around and inspire all of Chital for the future as it proceeds the Process."\n\n"I'll look a fool from here to Colthage. Benjen the fake, Benjen the fraud, the Painted King." Benjen stared at Jakob in shock, the colour fading from his face\n\n"That's the wrong attitude to take. See this as a potential, set your mind to it and you can become the figure of strength you see here." Jakob slapped him on the shoulder."

Davirtannen quickly glanced around corridor to make sure they were alone. The hotel had been vetted before they'd arrived but one could never be sure who was listening. "You need to see this."

Get Eva on the phone and tell her to pull all funding to Hira's department, then get Jakob to cut her military clearance, and make sure all the factory owners know what's she's been up to and don't supply her with anything that hasn't first been approved by you and me.

Взглянув на место с дальней части вагона, она заметила Бхушана — тот вовсю дрых и пускал слюни, впадая в тоску от происходящего. Покачав головой, Хира оглядела остальной салон.\n\nНичего особенного, впрочем, не происходит — делегаты угощаются роскошными винами и едой вместе с членами ярлского двора, и никто толком не понимает, что происходит. Все эти олени сами по себе не так важны, как поездка монарха, и те лишь едят и пьют.\n— Благодарю Вас, уважаемый, — Бенджен встаёт, заставив вздрогнуть отвлёкшуюся Хиру, — я рад нашей встрече, Ваши идеи и планы мне весьма по душе, — Бенджен взглянул на Хиру, и та на секунду поймала взгляд нетипично живой для него самого. И снова отвернулся к делегату, — Надеюсь, мы скоро сможем встретиться в Осткранби и претворить их в реальность. А теперь пойдёмте чего-нибудь перекусим.\n\nКак только они отошли, Хира рысью подбежала к Бхушану и со всей силы стала трясти — тот проснулся и уставился на олениху:\n— Что случилось, мадам?\n\n— Пора приводить план в действие."

He smiled and raised his head to the nobledoe who bowed in return and stepped away from him. Eva returned him a warm smile; everything was going smoothly. The gardens were immaculately presented, with tables spread with food and drinks dotted between the flower beds. Deer were dressed in their finery and the mood was better than he feared it would be. The minor lords and ladies of Gondeerana had come out in force.\n\nThe southern lords were mostly Hindian and none too fond of Benjen but Eva had, once again, assured him as long as he gave no insult and respected them the local nobility would do likewise; they did not hate him, just mistrust him. There was scope to build a better relationship and that was the first step developing the region which had historically been ignored and neglected.\n"Well done Yaril, dignified and graceful if I may say soo." Eva said, coming to stand on his left side.\n"Yes it's nice to see things going smoothly."\n"Why wouldn't it, these deer aren't your enemies, they've just been forgotten about and are used to being ignored, it tends to make one a bit prickly but just remember what I taught you and you'll be fine. Poise and grace in all things Yaril. We've the lunch, then the fire dancing followed by meeting with some teachers and students, should be a busy afternoon."\n\n"Indeed, but strangely I'm looking forward to it" He took a deep relaxed breath of the evening air, savouring the scent of the flowers in the gardens.

His car had taken the main road south before turning onto Doenka avenue; crowds were lining the routes all excited to see Benjen on his way through. Jakob accompanied him along with 6 guards and 17 police officers as they travelled. It was a nice day, they were enjoying themselves, for the most part, Jakob still looked as grumbly as ever as he sat next to the Yaril in the car but Benjen could tell the old soldier was enjoying the weather and perhaps just a bit of the crowd's appreciation.\n\nOn a roof top overlooking the route a deer sat eating a sandwich. To his left was a small radio tuned to a dead frequency, on his right a Karabiner 'Kralle' 06, the finest mid-ranged rifle on the market, just the tool of the job. As he finished his lunch the motorcade made its way slowly down the avenue towards his vantage point; He had his instructions, half the bits for the work and an indifferent nature to the situation. With a sigh as his back cracked, he lifted the rifle and placed it upon the ledge of the roof, humming to himself as he gave the scope a small twist, adjusting the range and compensated for the angle. A pity really, it was all too easy, no challenge in it at all. He looked down the scope and saw the car approaching, a clear shot.\n\n"Here's to Benjen V, last of his name.

He saw Jakob emerge from the carriage further down the platform, barking orders as some guards tried to clear the crowd. The old soldier's appearance did nothing to dampen the mood, in fact a few flowers landed at Jakob's hooves something which appeared to confuse him greatly.\n\nDavirtannen stepped down from the carriage into the small space cleared by the guards. He smiled as he looked around, regarding the crowd as though they were friends come to welcome them all home. Eva followed him, taking his hoof as she stepped from the train.

Masked deer wielding holy two-handed scimitars carried off cargo, slaughtered guards, and took prisoner hundreds of deer behind the exploitation of their own brothers and sisters. The spoils were distributed among the hungry folk of Gondeerana, those pressed back into thralldom returning to their homelands on caravans commandeered by Tuya stalwarts. For those choice caravaneers found to be funneling opium and other such poisons to the people of the South, or known to be among Jakob and Eva's inner circles, the Tuya did not give them the mercy of a trial in Ostkranbi, instead holding impromptu religious trials that found them guilty on the spot.\n\nFollowing the carnage in Gondeerana, Ramachan's own agents turned their attention to the letters of Haarihus, of Fraskal, of Kanelimpra and Ostkranbi all, which now formed a great ledger of nobles and bureaucrats known to be involved in economic impressment, corruption, and violent reprisals. Prosperous plantations one day soon found themselves without owners the next as a brutal campaign of assassination and intimidation menaced those who would dare harm the children of Mahimata. Scores of allies of the Axis of Chital, of course, found themselves candidates for every vacancy.\n\nAs she pondered on the days before her, the Chief Minister and spymistress turned a letter, and another, and another, and simply smiled - instead of Madame Hira Ramachan, they were all written for "Mother Hira", the blessed matriarch of Chital."

She draped a hoof over the doe's shoulders.\n"I don't want this. I... I never wanted this. I'd never even left the grounds of father's estate until three days ago. I just wanna go home." Brienna quietly muttered as tears slipped down her cheeks.\n\n"Don't worry. I'll be right there to help you through." Hira replied, pulling her into a tight hug.\n"You... you will?" Brienna looked up, hope shining in her eyes.\n"Of course, I'm your friend, your father may be gone but I wouldn't let you go through this alone." Taking a handkerchief Hira gently dried Brienna's tears. "You know, this position doesn't have to be all doom and gloom, boring paperwork and scary decisions, it can be a lot of fun. Parties, visiting other countries, having every young stag after your affection. I tell you what. I'll deal with the paperwork and you just focus on enjoying yourself."\n\n"You'd do that, for me?" she sniffed.\n"Of course. What are friends for.""

chital.28.d:0 "Мадам Хира давно стремилась синкретизировать махиматизм с верованиями и культами старооленийских Годи и тем самым положить конец религиозному раздору в Читале. Кульминацией её попыток стала организация великой конференции в Монтабе.\n\nОдним из главных придворных советников, представлявшим Годи, был Коннар — убеждённый последователь Укко, противник того, что сам называл "примитивными языческими ритуалами ушедших эпох". Он считал, что верность традиционным ценностям оленийской религии должна быть у правительства на первом месте — с чем вот уже которую неделю и надоедал Хире Рамачан, не желавшей признавать Годи ведущей религиозной силой страны.\n\n— Вот дадим мы ещё больше власти эти махиматистам с их отсталыми идеями — они уничтожат весь институт Годи, каким мы его знаем, а заодно превратят эту страну в некий первобытный материнский культ. Всё, чего правительство ярила добилось за последние несколько лет, превраится в руины, — так Коннар и говорил на конференции, стуча копытом по столу, — Все туянцы есть террористы, а махиматисты не только им не мешали, они позволили им вычистить всех несогласных с Осью в сельских регионах! Читалу нужны традиции, нужна гордость, а ещё предводительство оленийцев и оленьих богов. А если и синкретизировать религии, то пускай Махимата считается одной из богов пантеона, наравне с остальными:\n\nУчение Коннара о религиозном превосходстве оленийской церкви втретило противодействие у части королевского двора, особенно от Бхушана Гурата — члена Читальской Оси и приятеля Рамачан. Будучи членом ополчения Туймаиянату и не менее убеждённым последователем хиндийской религии, Бхушан предлагал объединить религии таким образом, чтобы Махимата считалась всевышней матерью всех богов — в согласии с принципами махиматистского единобожия.\n\n— Ясно, что Коннар неправ во своих изметаниях лживой проповеди о принципах Махиматы и о сути ея как Богини. Махимата есть матерь всех хиндийцев, оленийцы же только и алкают развратить нас своей современной, бессодержательной храмовой системой. Они заставят нас разрушить нашу же родину, искоренить наши исконные порядки, выкорчевать нашу же культуру ради возвращения к некоему "благому" управлению, — заявлял Бхушан, — Его убеждения столь же бессрасудны, сколь и пагубны, и я взываю к Хире — опроче остального — признать Махимату как верховную богиню пантеона и покровительницу всего Читала от лица державы."

Но мадам Хира умолчала о деталях встречи, упомянув лишь чрезвычайную её важность, и что-то о предвестии новой эры Читала.\n\n— Объясню вам кратко нашу миссию, прежде чем мы приступим непосредственно к работе над самим Советом. Все мы знаем, что изначальный Совет семи провалился по всем пунктам — настолько, что Бенджену пришлось набирать в него всё новых прихлебателей, служащих его интересам и заглушающих голос народа. Давайте запомним: идея Совета Семи не была, по существу, идеей плохой, ибо именно нам, благородным оленям и лидерам Читала, надлежил править страной. Однако безрассудное высокомерие и принебрежение нуждами простых читальцев — вот что превратило Совет в воистину отвратительное образование!\nВот почему, — продолжила Хира, переведя дух, — я позвала вас сюда. Мы возродим из пепла старый совет и выстроим новую систему, которая не будет притворяться, будто она представляет интересы всех читальцев — она будет представлять их на деле.

The old representative of the Godi sought to advise Hira as he had once sought to advise Benjen.\n\n"The wisdom of the Godi is not something that should be cast aside so quickly Madame Hira. There are many areas into which we have insight."\n"Indeed? Tell me Konnar do you still have that nephew in Sambar who smuggles arms? What wisdom can you offer about him?" Konnar raised an eyebrow in surprise but didn't break his step. "The Godi do not have quite the level of insight they might think they do." She smiled, proud of the reach she had.\n"In which case would you care to enlighten me as to why you have summoned me here, not that I don't appreciate the invitation." He continued; the rumours of Madame Hira's network of agents were evidently true, he had to trend careful lest he find out what other rumours were true.\n\n"What if I were to offer you Chital." Konnar stopped in his tracks as Hira continued strolling without looking back at him. "On the first of next month Yarila Brienna will announce that the official state religion of Chital shall be Usko. The worship of Mahimata will be rolled into the pantheon as just another goddess and every town and city will be required to have a temple dedicated to their honour; that is, if I tell her to go forward with it." She glanced back over her shoulder at him meeting his eyes.\n"Such a great honour would require some recompense surely. There must be some way we can repay this example of generosity." He bowed his head low, playing the game she'd laid out.\n"I am interested in the status of the faith in Chital. I would like reports every two weeks on who is attending these services and how often. Seems fair doesn't it; to care for the spiritual wellbeing of our deer."\n"Oh, very fair indeed but, why do you need us for this?

The front page was dominated by the headline "Leading Godi Murdered." With a picture of Konnar below. The old Godi who had once sought to advise and influence Benjen now lay dead, choked to death with his own sermons shoved down his throat. Such a brutal murder would be very badly investigated, and his murderer never brought to justice, she was sure of it.\n\nWhat a pity though; with Konnar dead the godi would have to elect a new representative but with no clear candidate it would quickly turn into infighting and arguments. In that power vacuum the Mahimatists would step forward and takeover the spiritual support of the nation. In just a few months' time Mahimatism would be declared the official state religion of Chital and an ancient wrong would be put right.\n\nBlowing gently on her tea her eyes met those of a doe sitting across the room from her.

Bhushan paused before slowly lowering his hoof back to the ground, glaring daggers at his former ally.\n\n"Ivar, I'm genuinely impressed." Hira complimented through the tension. "I never thought you had it in you." The initial shock of the takeover had left her and now, seeing the pieces fall into place, she couldn't help but appreciate the underhoofed nature of it all.\n\n"We always knew there would only be one winner here but don't think me ungrateful, I am letting you walk away, your lives intact and lands unmolested. Consider it a consolation prize for coming second but there's no room in my new Republic for you both. For your lies or your bloodlust."

Although many in the court suspect Hira is using Bhushan as a front for her own operations, the new rebellion has taken up the name and flag of the Tuymaiyānatu, a native religious sect determined to protect their lands and faith from what they believe is an encroachment by a foreign Yaril.

Interestingly enough, Bhushan and his warlords have also managed to take much of the native province of Gondeerana, controlled by Axis sympathizer Eva Pillai.

Another way might be to say that he's honest and trustworthy." She looked at him side on.\n\n"Now Hira, that's not-"\n\n"Ivar let me make this quite clear to you. You are in this position precisely because you are a smooth-tongued, hardnosed, cold-eyed, two-faced creep and I know that under that layer of bravado, you fear me. You know I'll never trust you and that I can unmake you in a heartbeat." Ivar swallowed, the mask slipping for just a moment. "So, I also know that you will do everything that is needed to do what I tell you, things that an honest deer wouldn't do. Not to mention the publicity benefits, Olenian and Chitali working together, what a symbol but just remember this, don't you ever try to get one over on me. Do I make myself clear?"\n\n"Crystal." He replied, steadying his hoof as he sipped his water.\n\n"Wonderful, now you must try the roulade.""

chital.51.t:0 "Assembling The Advisors"
chital.51.d:0 "Hira unrolled the map as the deer gave her the space to move around the table. The map, which had been created at her request, was a detailed survey for every industrial zone, railway, mining complex and shipping hub in the country. It came as no surprise to any of the thirty advisors, civil servants, and industrialists in the room that almost all these sites where in the north and clustered along the coast. Eva shook her head. For years she'd been arguing that the south needed investment and support but nodeer had listened to her.\n\n"As you can see" Hira began "The current economic development model has left a great deal to be desired. Regardless of the social benefits, having all our industry localised in one place is a terrible idea. When one freak storm can cripple our economy, we're in a bad way. The Benjen IV bureau is starting to yield results, but we have a long way to go. Eva." The doe was startled at the mention of her own name.\n"Yes Hira?" the deer around her shifted as she made her way next to the table to get a clearer view of the map.\n"How would you address this imbalance." Her question seemed surprisingly earnest; no tone of derision thinly failed.\n"I'd start by cancelling the construction of all new factories along the coast and relocate the plans inland, there's a few locations already scouted and opportunities for nearby mines. I wrote a report about all this a few years ago." Did Hira care about her opinion or was this just another one of the spymistress' schemes?\n"I know you did, I read it. I want you to take your plans and put them into practice. Don't move any existing sites but bring the rest of the country up to the same level."\n\n"Very well, I'll make the calls." Eva was shocked as she left the room, Hira had often spoken of her "Road to Justice" but she'd assumed it was a political ploy; now she was being given free rein to rebuild the country's economy. Maybe there's still some hope for Chital after all."

chital.52.d:0 "His front hooves were shaking when Benjen Davirtannen wandered into the den of Hira Ramachan for the very first time - the seat of the sypmistress and now Diwan's iron hold over the Yarildom of Chital.\n\nHira had summoned him to a meeting after months of uncertainty, where Benjen continued to pace around the old factory, instructing his workers and drafting up policies for reform that would all end up in the wastebasket. Hira was no Benjen, and Davirtannen did not want to risk his reputation and livelihood by pushing for reform too much. Hoversholm may be tolerated, but him? No doubt Davirtannen was a symbol of the old regime to Hira, a decadent industrialist with no interest in sharing any of his power with poor Olenian nor any Southern native.\n\nNow, however, that fragile peace between them had been shattered, and Davirtannen found himself before Hira, crowned in the finest regalia fit only for a Princess of Chital, let alone a humble spymistress, and Bhushan and Marsha Gurat, her willing puppets in the grand quest for power that had taken the young deer to rulership.\n\n"Madame Hira," Davirtannen bowed, "I had not expected that you would call upon me now, some months after you had first taken power, not of course that I had any reservations about such a coup. My only duty is to serve Chital, of course, and accomplish the great goals of the Benjen IV Industrial Bureau."\n\nHe forced a smile while Hira entertained a whisper from Bhushan. The delicate little noble who had first been appointed to the position of councildeer so many years ago now seemed a giant, and Davirtannen knew the fate of his operations was all in her hands - Hira's. The famously fickle and jovial lady who spent most her time in public laughing with others, reading and listening cheap Equestrian entertainment, and if the rumors about deviancy were true, certain... other things, was the sole arbiter of the position of the old and weathered industrialist, but Davirtannen wondered if all that fanfare was just an act, a disguise. It didn't matter now. What mattered was her response.\n\n"I have called you hear for many reasons Davirtannen, but hearing your old spiel about service to the crown was unfortunately not one of them," Hira smiled to herself and Marsha Gurat snickered next to her, "The fact is that I have missed exacting the judgement of the Axis upon you, as one of the Council, but I had been pondering your place in Chital for many months."\n\nA pause took the room as Hira chose her next words with careful deliberation:"

Most of them had cut deals with the police and ended up paying extortionate fines to avoid prison time; the few unlucky enough to be made examples of would never see the free light of day again. Once the decline had started there was no stopping it, the rot set in and ate through the nobles like worms through a coffin lid.\n\nHira stamped her signature on the seizure order and added it to the pile. Everything was proceeding just as planned. Across the south nobles were on the verge of bankruptcy, their wealth stripped bare by the strangely precise fines and penalties, as though they'd been worked out specify to push them to the edge. The council, in its kindness and wisdom had agreed to buy up their lands - at below market rates - and nationalise it. Some would become new industrial land, but most would be turned into parks or given back the wilds, a gift to the common deer.\n\nThose who wouldn't sell? Well fortunately they were all in prison and their lands forfeit. In fact, it appeared that only a small handful of Hira's friends and few councillors had managed to hold onto their lands and escape the accusing hoof of the law.\n\nStamping her seal on another order, she took pleasure in a job well done. The money seized would drive future investment and the tyranny of the Olenian nobility had finally been wiped clean."

The Riksdag building was at least 2 months behind schedule and still far from completion, but the session had already been set and they couldn't move it just because construction was still ongoing. So here they were, the new Republic conducting its business in a building site.\n\n"I call to order this session of the Riksdag. First order of business, the ratification of the constitution. I propose we discuss the position of representatives and the manner of voting. I take it all members of the house have read the draft?" A murmur of positive responses ran through the room. "Good and anydeer have any comments to make?" Again, there was general consensus as everydeer expressed their happiness with the document. Ivar sighed and shook his head; not one deer in the room had read the draft, if they had they'd have noticed that it was a complete farce, granting the office of Kansleri final say over pretty much every law that came through the Riksdag.\n\nIt was as he expected. The entire hall was full of yesdeer. None of them had any real experience with this "Democracy" thing; most hadn't even understood the rules when they stood for election and had fallen butt backwards into success. They all looked to Ivar, the self-professed ‘Great Republican' to lead the way and would do pretty much anything he said. While a nice situation to be in, it really wasn't what he wanted, now he'd have to do everything from organise the completion of the building to planning the nations school curriculum because every deer here would be hounding him constantly for his help. Sometimes being the hero is a problem all its own."

To Ivar Hoversholm, however, it was simply politics, and to his benefit, the people of Chital tended to forget their past convictions when their Kansleri took to the stage.\n\n"Countrydeer," the Kansleri began, adjusting his loose tie and gleaming at the audience, "What I am to announce is both unfortunate, necessary, and glorious - an end to an age of reaction and treachery, but the fall of many of Chital's old heroes, who in a time long before now I once considered my greatest allies."\n\n"The inner circle of Benjen V, his puppetmasters... you have heard my refer to them as "Progressives", but now, I shall be blunt - they are nothing more than traitors. Before I came to power they preached reform, spoke of a future of peace, justice, and harmony for the Chitali people and unity to heal the Oleno-Hindian conflict - worthy goals, I'm sure we would all agree. But now? Now? They have abandoned their past pretenses, our exceptional visions, and attempted, with all their power, to lead the government of and by the people to utter and complete collapse, for the sole goal of removing me, a "bigoted anti-harmonic despot", from power."\n\nHoversholm pictured them in his mind, and his blood curdled - Katarina, his sister, who in the great jealousy of an older, neglected sibling betrayed him the moment Benjen V cast him out, and Ninessen, the traitor, who appeased the court in one breath and condemned them in the next. It brought him a peace nothing else could bring him that these does would soon fall beneath the might of the Republic.\n\n"Under the cover of shadows, these members of the secret "Council of Six" plotted to destroy the fruits of my regime and... with no doubt finance an Equestrian-backed coup with the help of the repulsive S.M.I.L.E - and now, they stand detatched from any substantive positions of power.

The employment advisor asked, raising an eyebrow in confusion.\n"Because the proposal does not merit further discussion." Ivar responded without looking up.\n"Yes, it does." Kjetil responded, slightly taken a back at Ivar's flippant response. "I'm not the only one to think so either, the defence, health and education advisors are all onboard." He looked around the table for support and meet several nods of agreement.\n"I think you'll find if you check the minutes of the last meeting that there is no record of any such support." Ivar responded, meeting the advisor's eyes with a bored expression.\n\n"I... This... This is a fiddle. Why are you blocking it like this?!" The advisor asked, shock turning to anger as he became confused and frustrated.\n"Very simply. Decentralising government business means less control of the country.  It is folly to increase your knowledge at the expense of your power. There are benefits to the country I grant you but the Republic is still new and should not be destabilised like this and you'll just have to accept that." Ivar responded his hooves calmly folded on the table as he answered the advisor.\n"I won't accept this. This is absurd!" He yelled, slamming his hoof on the table.\n\n"You don't quite seem to understand your position. You are not a member of the Riksdag, nor do you have any power over the policy of the government. You are an advisor, that is what you do, you advise, nothing more. I however, as you quite rightly have said am Kansleri. I have the first and last word within Chital and if I say we're not doing this, we're not doing this. This is a one deer, one vote system. I am the deer; I have the vote.

Despite all that a sense of dread welled up inside of him as he made his way to the Kansleri's office for a small chat He knew it, deep down inside he knew, he was going to be dismissed or at least shouted at.\nSwallowing, his throat dry as he stopped outside Ivar's office, he gently knocked the door. From within he heard a muffled voice bid him enter and, heart thumping, he entered the office. The Kansleri sat behind his desk in the humbly decorated office; he smiled at Mikael as he entered and motioned to the chair on the other side of the desk.\n\n"Mikael, just the deer I wanted to see. I wanted to have a little chat; hope you don't mind."\n"Yes of course Kansleri, wha, what can I do for you?"\n"Well, it's this public transport grant scheme, I'd like to hear your thoughts on the matter."\n"Oh I, I'm just a junior minister, surely you'd be better asking the minister for transport."\n\n"Perhaps but I asked around a bit and I heard you used to work for the Gondeerana bus company before the elections. I believe you can provide some real working insight into the issues, and I believe in promoting the best deer for the job at hand, no voice is too small if they have something valuable to say. Now I know this work would be quite the promotion, but I feel you're up for it, so what do you say?"\n\n"I... but, but of course Kansleri how could I refuse."

It was a strange sensation, he'd never taken part in such a rite before, but needs must when the matters of state were involved. The whole process gave him time to think about his own religious beliefs. The decision to declare Usko as the state religion had not been taken lightly and it had stirred up a lot of hostility in the provinces. More than once the police had to be sent in to break up a rally and the Tuya were almost always involved in some way. It was fortunate they'd lost a lot of their influence and weapons stashes otherwise there might have been full scale civil war by now.\n\nThe benefits outweighed the risks; by bringing the Godi into the fold they had placated the Olenians throughout Chital, those deer held a lot of influence and keeping them onside mattered. The whole affair still felt strange to him though, he'd considered religion an important part of the state but on a personal level there were so many to choose from, where would he even begin and going down that rabbit hole could end badly. There was no shortage of fanatics in the world, the Tuya of instance or the Chiropterrans of the west. The world needed more moderates, not more devotees.\n\nThe old Godi finished knotting the charms into Ivar's antlers and began to mumble a prayer Ivar had little understanding of and less interest in.

It turned out the nearest room was the broom cupboard and now these two former council members were wedged together with no escape from questioning.\n\n"Why am I hearing rumours that you plan to seize the land from noble families across the country?!" She demanded.\n\n"That bill has not yet been brought before the Riksdag and it will be discussed caref-" He tried to placate before being cut off.\n\n"Don't give me that, we both know you can push anything you want through that place. I want to know now if there's any truth in it. My family lands are not just something you can seize. We have history there, my grandfather fought for every inch of it."\n\n"Eva, I understand, I do really, but we both know that among the nobles there are still some monarchists who would see a new Yaril crowned. To get rid of them I must seize their lands and titles, but I can't play favourites. If the state seizes some land, it must seize it all otherwise I won't look impartial anymore. I'm sorry I really am, and I'll make sure you are reimbursed at above market rates for the land, you and your partner won't go hungry but this needs to happen for the stability of the Republic."\n\n"If I could swing a hoof in here, I'd knock you out."

That was what the papers reported, the truth was she had been invited along to discuss the position of the nobility. The presence of the public guaranteed that their discussion would have to remain civil.\n\n"And what" she asked between chats with the deer, "would be the terms of this arrangement?"\n"The nobles on the list will have to give up their titles and become private citizens but they'll keep their lands. They'll also be offered positions in the civil service suitable to their skills."\n"And those not on the- why thank you, what lovely flowers." She smiled as she bowed her head, a shy young fawn draped a small daisy chain over one of Eva's antlers before scamping back to her mother. "Those not on the list, what about them?"\n\n"Titles gone; lands gone; they're gone. They've either got no skills to speak of or are too attached to the idea of the monarchy. Have you come far?"

So confusing, backwards, and unusable was the Bureau that many deer just talked to each other and sorted out their issues at a local level without involving the Bureau for fear of making the issue ten times worse.

It talked of providing hand tools for farmers instead of tractors, the best way to encourage localised weaponsmiths instead of centralising production in factories, how to improve upon existing construction instead of experimenting with completely new engineering approaches. It was also rather derogatory, assuming most of the native Hindians lived in mud huts in the jungle and survived on subsistence farming with little understanding of land ownership. It talked of seizing farmland to grow spices without payment for the land.\n\nThis report was 3000 pages of outdated, meaningless administrative drivel.

Only Ninessen furrowed her brow and spoke up with a serious response, declaring that Eva had sent notes the previous day about disturbing news in the South - agents of the Chitali government were found dead outside Haarihus, their warrants for Shah's arrest still in their hooves. Eva, of course, had assumed it was the Reds, but Ninessen and the Yaril both knew Shah no longer had the base to make such bold statements.\n\nIt had to have been Ramachan.\n\nWith Ninessen and Davirtannen's backing, primitive automobiles set out at dawn to track down the spymistress and find the last known places she had reared her vile head in.

A hasty request for the position of Chief Minister, a denial, a violent reaction from Hoversholm and then an equally brutal one from the Yaril, though, resigned that once-so-tangible power to nothing more than a historical footnote. Humilation followed, cries of schemer and traitor and power-hungry usuper, but Hoversholm could do little to defend himself, for in the end it all was true.\n\nWhen the Council of Seven opened yet again, he found himself among the opposition - not as Ivar the Reformer nor Ivar the Traitor - but as Ivar the Chameleon, a humble member of the Axis of Chital, and a voice of passion, reason, and kindness to all in court - and as a voice of snide and condescending disapproval behind their backs. Hoversholm preferred to think of this new persona not as one of contradictions, but one based only in simple bendings of the truth to further his own superior ideals, and the prosperity of all of Chital as a result. Smiling, he recalled moments laughing off the Axis to the face of Benjen, then plotting in shadowed meetings with that same group of deer, all the while speaking fondly of the common traditionalist deer to Jakob the Grey.\n\nIf all went well this next session of the Council, that friendly face to both the Yaril and the Axis would be Hoversholm, and a simple change of pace could grant him the power to bring prosperity to Chital's children for generations."

It had been the crowning ideal of the reign of Benjen IV to move into the Industrial Revolution as in Equestria and the Griffonian Empire had, and it was the job of Davirtannen to make sure every one of Benjen IV's reforms actually functioned as intended. And work he did, each and every day, to make sure Benjen V did not have to bear the public relations nightmare of an industrial accident, machinery collapse or brutal injury to some young apprentice.\n\n"Each death for us is another tool for Bhushan to continue his anti-technological fury and continue to keep technology out of the south," Benjen IV had told him matter-of-factly when he originally appointed Davirtannen to his position as overseer of Ostkranbi industrial affairs, "One accident could cause a chain reaction that would tear the whole south apart in fury - a fury you know whould be directed against us, and only us."\n\nThere was truth to that, Davirtannen knew. Although he could still not comprehend some of the sheer absuridty of the tactics of the jackals in the Chitali government, Benjen IV had taught him much about the court, lessons that would translate to his rise to more and more powerful positions during the reigns of the next two Yarils. Davirtannen could not shake off the feeling, as he walked, however, that he had made the wrong choices. That Jakob or Hira or even Hoversholm, his old ally, would someday devour him, and crush the old breaucrat under the spirit of a new age of reform.\n\nIf there was anything he could do, it was to move on with his projects, make them as efficient as possible, innovate into electronics, industry, RADAR - to make himself so vital to the spirit of Benjen IV's modernizations that he would be more than a politician or an opportunistic reformer. Then, Davirtannen would triumph, and guide the Yaril through an age of wisdom and reason."

He could of course recognize Ieffri Huddarnen, one of his least favorite deer among the nobility - a backwards traditionalist with little respect for the Yaril he was supposed to serve by his own royalist principles. Among him was a diplomat of House Gadra - no doubt Sanjay, the young conservative rebel. Both misguided deer, dreaming of a world where they, the traditionalists, were the only clique capable of saving Chital, and where deer like Davirtannen and Ninessen were all crypto-markists, traitors and radicals working from within to corrupt the Yaril. No doubt some on the left wished they were right, but Davirtannen was no radical Marksist.\n\n"Benjen," Sanjay Gadra smiled, glancing down at a paper stamped by the Yaril himself, "You are hereby relieved of your duties as chief executive officer of the Royal Manufacturing and Electronics Corporation and chief advisor to the Yaril on the matters of welfare and industry. By the.. er... orders of Diwan Jakob Kudlinen, and Benjen himself."\n\nA sour feeling came over Davirtannen, but he knew better than to resist an order from Jakob the Grey.\n\n"Of course, Mr. Gadra," Davirtannen bowed, "I was glad I could serve my Yaril while I could. Do tell - will my industries themselves be nationalized?"\n\nGadra and Huddarnen glanced at eachother with shock, as if they thought Benjen another Ninessen, ready to defend their harmonic beliefs to the face of any traitor. For Benjen Davirtannen, however, it was different.\n\n"Of course not, sir..." Gadra could not find the words to continue.\n\n"Good.

I would hardly call your mission anything but ceremonial, Jakob," his lieutenant, the young freed thrall turned officer Pensha Rashanth, turned and gave him a smile, "It's clear the Yaril cares little for your advice, and why would he? Too busy listening to - who's that new doe - Ninessen? They tried to hold me up as a progressive native officer once... ah, I remember how my disapproval to follow their every whim shook the Yaril's little clique..."\n\nJakob snorted and let out yet another sigh as the carriage bumped along the western road to Ostkranbi, his eyes glancing out the window to the open farms and plantations of Kanelimpra. "I have served in the courts of three Yarils, but our little nephew Ben seems more and more interested in disregarding my knowledge and lending his ears to weak-willed traitors," Jakob responded, "Progressives grow boldened and so does the Axis... would that he would take a lesson from his father and let me do what I do best. No doubt I would have all of them fired within days - at my nicest."\n\n"That kind of talk would get you nowhere with him, Jakob." Pensha gave a sigh of her own, "You are a dying breed in Ostkranbi, remember that. Your allies are all here, just waiting for you to strike - not that the vultures circling you are even remotely fit for advisory."\n\nJakob gave a grimace and turned his gaze from outside to himself.

The gathered officials watched with rapt attention, for many this was the fulfilment of a dream; a Hindian deer taking her place as she approached the Yaril.

But what emerged was not the council as a whole; it was just Ivar himself, dressed in his signature loose suit and glasses, looking somber as none had seen him before.\n\nStepping to a podium before the assembled reporters, he began to speak, "My dear countrydeer. A great tragedy has befallen this nation. During the Royal Progress two days ago, our Yaril Benjen was kidnapped and killed by far-right, reactionary generals, including General Huddarnen. Since then, national soldiers have had the city on lockdown to search for clues, and I apologize for waiting this long to inform you all. We needed all the evidence first.

I would like to ask you to postpone asking any further questions, for I must take my time to grieve. Benjen was a close friend of mine, and I must now make my peace as well."\n\nIvar exited the stage as the crowd erupted in shock and rage at what he had told them, republican chants began to rise amongst them as reporters rushed to get the story to the presses and broadcast it all over Chital.\n\nWalking back into the council chambers, Ivar Hoversholm sighed and said to himself, "Sorry old friend.

The deer laughed, "You know I've already said plenty. But it's all the same, I guess. I just feel uncertain. This nation was supposed to be under my care. But here it is, under his." The doe frowned, "But you trust him, do you not? Try to think about the best in things!"\n\nBenjen smiled.

The country was unstable at the time, the death of Benjen IV having opened old wounds and the coronation had been kept small to avoid inflaming them.\n\nTimes were different now. The royal progress had been a resounding success and the enthusiasm for the Yaril had grown significantly. Now was the right moment for a grand public display, a second coronation for Benjen to reflect the new nation Chital was becoming. Andreas had planned out the route for the procession through Ostkranbi in the royal carriage followed by the honour guard of the Royal Grenadeers. The coronation would take place in the White Tower and be broadcast by radio to the country; it would secular to avoid any awkwardness about religion but with flairs of Hindian and Olenian culture. Nobles from all over would come and make a big show of coming. Then the Yaril would be presented to the nation from the balcony of the White Tower to the nation.\n\nBenjen was, understandably, not happy about this plan but as Eva had explained "Whether you like it or not you are a symbol to Chital and it's time that symbol was something the nation as a whole could support."\n\nSmiling as her tailor adjusted her dress Eva let the plan play through her mind again."

"Pankaja, I've told you before you can't do that here, you need to be paying attention of the flow or some of it will spill and hurt somedeer."\n\n"I'm offer prayers to the metal as it's shaped. It's an ancient tradition Hindian practice." The deer watched the glowing liquid as he sat on his haunches.\n\n"It's not about cultural heritage, it's about safety. This is a steel mill not a temple, now get up and get back to work."\n\nThe deer refused to rise from the floor. "This ore lay buried in the earth for thousands of years until a hoof disturbed it, dug it up, melted it down and forged it into a beam to support a roof. Offering prayers to it is not idleness, it's respect for what is has given and the spirits of the earth that created it an-" He jumped suddenly pulling the foredoe to the side as a glob of metal the size of his hoof spat from the mould and landed where she had been standing.\n\nCatching her breath after having the wind knocked from her, she watched as the red-hot liquid cooled to solid Iron.

Caarlit shouted over the noise as an engindeer checked some of the gauges and adjusted the water pressure.\n\n"It makes a statement, a symbol. ‘Full steam ahead' says Eva. An infrastructure rollout for the nation, a united country thundering to the future with myself in the driving seat." She leaned out of the cab and saw the station approaching.\n\n"I hate coal. The dust gets everywhere." He moaned, trying to wipe the worst of it off his hooves while easing on the brakes.\n\n"Just make it work for you." She chuckled adjusting her boiler suit to make the most of working-deer-chic image she was going for. The train slowed to a gentle roll as it trundled into the station, Eva leaning out the cab as the reporters turned to see which train it was and were greeted by the surprise sight of the Chief Minister covered in coal dust smiling down at the crowd from the cab. "Expecting me to arrive by coach?" She shouted, making herself heard over the noise of the crowd and the fading engine. "In finery? I'm not afraid to get my hooves dirty you know." She dusted off some of the soot. "I'm here to announce the new modernisation project. This is what it's all about, connecting up the country.

Eva smiled warmly looking out of the doors to the balcony as the sun shone down on the White Tower, it really had been a fine day. She and Benjen had been married in a small private ceremony for close friends and family, and the other members of the council; now came the public reveal of the new couple. Deer had come from all over the country to see the union of the future, Hindia and Olenia joined together.\n\nShe sighed happily, the day was just a touch bitter sweet, she'd always hoped to marry for love but needs must. Her partner had been present at the service and was now helping organise the guard of honour. He hadn't been too happy, but he understood - as Benjen had - that Chital needed this marriage to bring together the deer and start to heal the old divisions.\n\nAcross the room Benjen fussed over Ruusu. She'd put a brave face on things, seeing her love married to another doe couldn't be easy. "Don't worry." Eva called, gaining their attention as she crossed the room to the couple. "I won't borrow him for long. Just the odd public appearance, then you can both get back to being adorable." She hugged her.\n\n "Are... are you sure?" Ruusu nervously replied pulling back from the hug to look in Eva's eyes.\n\n"Trust me." She smiled. Stepping back, she turned to Benjen. "It's time." The Yaril kissed Ruusu, lingering briefly in her embrace before pulling himself away and following Eva out onto the balcony. He was clearly nervous, "I can't believe I'm doing this."

Exiting the office at pace Hira nodded to the guards on the door and they in turn moved into action. Throughout the building security officers received word and stormed the offices of nobles, collecting every scrap of paperwork they could find. Those nobles unfortunate enough to be in their office were read the bill and dragged from the building.\n\nThis was the largest of land since the invasion hundreds of years ago. Fully half of the nobility would lose their holdings and be stripped of their titles and positions to be left to fend for themselves. Fortunately, there was little they could do about it as all the useful nobles who could actually organise a resistance were to keep their lands.\n\nThose that remained would be organised into advisory committees specialising in science, industry, cultural development and more, the more qualified of them holding more senior positions. At last Chital would have a nobility that worked to improve the state of the country and actually knew what they were talking about. The future would certainly look bright now so much of the dead weight would been cleared away."

There was sporadic gunfire as they advanced but most were taken prisoner before they had a chance to arm themselves. Any quick enough to grab a gun were shot where they stood with no offer of surrender. The prisoners were tied up and dumped together in the centre of the temple.\n\nThis was not Eva's first choice, but Jakob had pleaded his case effectively. When dealing with an armed group of militarist monks it was best to handle them quickly and precisely even if she'd have preferred the negotiate.\n\nBhushan was the only one offered quarter, dragged by the antlers from one of the temple rooms, bleeding from several slashing wounds where he'd put up a fight. All told around 150 monks had been captured alive and all throughout the south similar dawn raids were taking place.\n\n"Nice to see you again Bhushan." The former councillor spat blood at the soldier's feet.\n\n"Just get it over with Jakob, if you're going to kill me then kill me." Bhushan snarled.\n\n"Kill you? We're not the savages you seem to think we are Bhushan. No, you will be put on trial as the head of an illegal terrorist organisation and serve your time in prison.

Wishful thinking perhaps." He sat on his haunches by a small alter.\n\n"Bhushan." She pushed down the insult and set her mind to the task at hand. "You know why I'm here. You need to disarm the Tuya."\n\n"And why should I do that? Let me guess if we don't disarm Jakob will come down here and force us to disarm. We both know how that ends."\n\n"I know you are prepared to die for your faith, but are you prepared to live for it?" Bhushan raised a curious eyebrow at her question. "If you voluntarily give up your arms the Tuya will be recognised as an official religious order and allowed to continue their practices, free from interference. The state does not want to wipe out your faith, it just doesn't want armed organisations running around in the jungles."\n\n"What proof have you of this claim? What's to stop you wiping us out once you've taken our guns?" If Eva wanted his trust, she should have picked a better messenger than the doe who'd stabbed him in the back. Hira produced a scroll from her saddle bag.\n\n"Here is a draft of the bill recognising the minority faiths in the state, yours amongst them, it's currently going through review and just needs Eva's stamp of office. This is all publicly available; you can check it yourself in the council minutes. When you hand over the guns, she'll sign it." She passed him the scroll. Read through the bill he confirmed it was all in order. The choice was his, hand over the guns or have the Tuya wiped off the face of the earth. Not much of a choice at all."

He'd been given the task as Eva was too busy setting out broader policies and he, as something of a fixer, would be able to get the best deals from industry. There were very little railways to speak of and the roads, water supplies and electricity lines were clustered round the coast, very few of them extending inland, much as they're feared.\n\n"This isn't going to be easy, is it?" Caarlit asked over his shoulder, the councillor had been assigned to help and keep tabs on the former axis member.\n\n"What gives you that impression. All we've got to do is industrialise a nation that's a good 70% jungle, 50% is without electricity and 40% doesn't have piped water." He sighed, picking up a quill as he began to make a list. "If we're going to do this, we'll have to bring each province up to the same standard before installing more advanced projects."\n\n"Sensible. It saves areas getting left behind and deer moving for better amenities."\n\n"It'll also be very popular with the deer in the outer provinces, build up our support a bit. We'll start by making sure the whole country has access to water, then power, then we'll look at expanding the rail networks and roads. In the long run it'll make Chital easier to industrialise as all the infrastructure will already be there when it comes time to build new factories.

Andreas added, a tone of annoyance creeping in. He'd been asked to make sure that Davirtannen didn't lose sight of the nation as a whole and it was a tougher battle than he'd expected.\n\n"Ahh, good point, well you tell me where the bases are and I'll draw up a plan for connecting them to the train hubs, best of both worlds."\n\nIt was a solid plan, focusing on key areas would mean they could expand quicker, saving time overall; the only problem was it didn't account for a lot of civilian infrastructure; large sections of the country would just have to develop on their own when issues arose. It would turn the cities into economic powerhouses and leave the countryside behind but you can't build and economy without treading on a few toes. Besides, those deer who wanted a better life could always move to the city which would bring in more workers, a win win really, provided you weren't a farmer."

For that was what he was now; Chital was his and Hindia lay ready to be reclaimed. Already the tainted of Olenia were fleeing the country on mass, their places in the cities being taken by Hindians. The lost were not without hope though, a few Olenians had begun to approach the monks of the Tuya, curious of their faith and this talk of salvation. There was a chance for these souls and - by Mahimata's grace - they may yet be saved and restored.\n\nThis is only the beginning, Goddess be praised.

Now Hira knelt next to Bhushan as the Sann-aiasi daubed her forehead with red powder, the temple filled with the Tuya and whatever ordinary Hindians had manged to get a seat.\n\n"May the Goddess guide your hooves in all your actions." The Sann-aiasi intoned before her as he laid a wreath of pale flowers over her antlers about her neck. Turning to Bhushan he began to same ritual with him as she bowed her head and pressed her antlers to the floor. This was going far beyond what she'd signed up for. During the takeover she'd somehow found herself siding with Bhushan and once the fighting had started it was impossible to stop it; she had completely lost control of the situation. Bhushan's warrior monks had seized all major cities and all she could do was watch as he began to rebuild the country in his image.\n\nThis Diarchy was a sham; she knew it just as much as he did. He could have her removed at any time despite her contacts but with the careful pulling of threads she might still have some influence to call on. She knew what his faith would lead him to attempt, the rites, the divisions in society that would come; Chital - and by extension Hindia - stood on a precipice.\n\nAs for the rest of the council she had yet to hear anything tangible. Eva and Ivar were apparently being held under house arrest, Jakob was holed up somewhere with some loyal soldiers and she had no idea about Davirtannen. Despite their disputes she hoped they'd be ok, things of the past though they were.\n\n"May the Goddess guide your hooves in all your actions."

Bhushan offered each of them redemption, a last courtesy afforded to everyone. Their reaction varied between outraged, dejected, denial and sobbing.\n\nTwo took the offer, they were placed in another truck with the Hindian nobles who were treated slightly better, allowed to keep their dignity, they'd be held until a decision could be made about their future. Their Olenian counter parts were being sent straight to the docks, put on a ship and sent to Olenia and whatever fate awaited them there, it didn't matter they weren't his problem anymore.\n\nThe tower itself - That ancient symbol of their oppression - would be demolished and the materials used to build a temple to Mahimata on the site, a fitting tribute to her authority, the highest authority in Hindia and a fine example of the changes that were going to take place throughout the whole country.\n\nFinally, the deer he sought was dragged from the tower. Jakob was bleeding heavily and missing an antler, the old soldier had not come quietly. The monks dragging him threw him to the ground at Bhushan's hooves. The Raja looked down on him. Jakob's eyes held nothing but hatred and a determination, he would not insult the soldier's honour by offering a redemption he wouldn't take. Jakob hauled himself to his hooves, aware of what was coming but too broken to fight anymore. He would die with his dignity if nothing else. Nothing needed to be said as Bhushan drew his Kukri and placed the tip on Jakob's throat, out of respect for a fellow warrior he would make it quick. With one swift thrust he drove the blade through Jakob's neck.\n\nJakob spat blood on Bhushans face, his eyes holding the Raja's to the last."

He had the army and the infrastructure but to make the takeover complete he needed to pull the common deer to his side.\n\nThe quiet murmurs went through the streets and slums in every city. Runners passing scrolls to the gang leaders and local figureheads. The message? "Bhushan calls. Take back your lives." A rallying cry they'd been for generations to hear. That night, when the protestors and supporters of the council took to the streets they were met by the dispossessed, the oppressed masses rising to meet them. Confused, a few thought these downtrodden deer were coming to join them and went to greet their new allies. They were the first to be beaten.\n\nAll over the country the protests turned into a rout. The poor outnumbered the well-off four to one and - fighting with the desperation of deer given hope - they drove the supporters of the council from their streets. The redistribution of wealth was swift as many deer were pursued to their homes, their doors smashed in, and possessions seized. The night was not without its casualties.

When Mahimata made deer, she made us perfect and peaceful but the gods of Olenia, jealous of her ability to create, stole some deer away and twisted their souls into aggressive and savage forms. To protect us she cast those deer across the ocean but, at their god's behest, they returned; the rest is history. She has not given up on them, those who accept her forgiveness shall be reborn into her grace and I shall never stop trying to save those who wish to be saved." His heart was heavy as he spoke, so many refused, so many had to be cast out.\n\n"Our nation was lost by the schemes of the past. We were not prepared for the tricks of the sea devils. We were a trusting nation; a kind nation and they took advantage of that. Never again will we make that mistake. Time was forged our trust into determination, our kindness into a Kukri to be wielded and with it we hacked our way free of them. Loyalty and duty to Hindia and the refusal to give in is what will keep us safe, so stay true to Hindia and hold it in your heart." He glanced out of the window at Ostkranbi and the hills beyond it. Prefection.\n\n"The Goddess is third and ultimate. Our herd is as she blessed us to be. Our nation is as she shaped us to be. It is from her that all is given. To deny her is to dishonour the very soul of everything we are, were and could ever be. She loves all deer but Hindian, who have remained true and pure hold a special place in her heart so hold her in ours, as the foal loves the doe."

Two years above him, Olaf used every opportunity to call him names, trip him up, knock the books out of his hooves and general make his life unpleasant.

They had learned the ancient truth, the corruption that had befallen their ancestors when the Olenian gods had cursed them, made them less than their Hindian cousins and stolen them away from the goddesses embrace. When they had learned what they were the five Olenians had been disgusted, ashamed and lost. That was when their guides, the holy monks of the Tuya - Sann-aiasi - had offered them the path to redemption. Through the rite their souls would be delivered to Mahimata and, through her grace, they would be cleansed and reborn as pure Hindians.\n\nThey had even been honoured by the Raja's presence for the ceremony, keen to see the first of the converts to take this step, his usual cold demeanour broken by a warm smile, today five souls would be returned to the goddess, the first five of many. He took up his position before the first convert, a young deer of no more than 20 years, hope shining through the fear in his eyes.

He'd heard word whilst in Colthage; Bhushan, Raja of Chital needed ships.\n\nTrading vessels, private military ships and even one luxury yacht had arrived to take the up the task; the expulsion of the Godi from all of Chital. How simple it would have been to drive them over the border and be done with it, but this was about more than getting rid of them, it was about sending a message. They were to be sent to Olenia, back to the icy wasteland they came from and when they arrived, they were to tell the deer there; Chital is free and you are not welcome.\n\nThere were several thousand of the Olenian priests that needed transport and the journey would be long and difficult, crossing the ocean and approaching Equus from the west. The money was there for anyone willing to attempt it and that promise more than anything had brought many a brave captain. The Raja knew there was a good chance a ship wouldn't make it, hence he hired foreign crews to attempt it and save risking the lives of his own navy.\n\nThe captain sighed, he knew the risks having crossed the ocean once before and losing a leg in the process, but if he could do it again then money he'd make would be enough to retire on, set up a little bar on the harbour in Baltimore maybe. His hold had been emptied, the basic supplies for 200 deer loaded on board, now he just had to wait for the trucks to arrive with their living cargo. Perhaps a few hundred Godi praying in the hold would calm the storms and keep the creatures that dwelt below the waves at bay, smoothing their passage; or maybe they'd just do their own funeral rights on the way to the bottom."

The entire palace would smell of incense and ring with quiet prayers at all hours, a fitting tribute to the goddess who made it possible.\n\nIt would be grand and impressive in its scale and function but the decoration simple, humble even.

What to do with the administrators? Those bureaucrats who knew the internal workings of government, every dirty secret, every hidden lie, they knew too much and wielded far too much power. The Raja might be the final power in the land but he could only make a ruling if he knew what was happening in his country.\n\nThese middle deer who controlled the flow of information needed to be dealt with and a loyal structure put in their place.

What was she - a manger in an ironworks - going do about this, would she even have a job to go to in the morning.\n\nWhen she'd arrived this morning, the workers were crowding around outside, hurling abuse and talking about seizing the foundry in the name of the Raja. She'd done her best to calm them down but things were getting out of hoof again. Suddenly they seemed to quiet outside and, looking out of the window, she could see new deer in uniforms arriving.\n\nThe police were here; she breathed a sigh of relief as she grabbed her jacket and trotted down to meet them. They'd explain to the workers that there would be a phased shift into government control for the foundry and that they could all go back to work now.

All the she need was a helpinghoof and some morale support.\n\n"I think... I think that's a great idea." Hira smiled warmly. Brienna's head shot up, disbeilf shinging in her eyes.

This was it, the first time in Chital's history that a democratic vote would be cast to decide the future. All over the country deer would be joining her in their first real taste of democracy voting for their local representative who would then form the new expanded council.

Hoofball is a long-time passion of the Kansleri, who discovered the sport during in Jezeragrad during one of his many tours of the Republics of Griffonia and was enraptured by it ever since.\n\nHoversholm, however, has been quick to deny any rumours that he founded the league as a personal vanity project, declaring that he hopes for investors across Zebrica and Griffonia to put money into teams in Chital and eventually formulate new international club competitions to further bolster a sense of cross-continental republican unity. The sport is a key pastime within the Republics of the River Federation and in Sicameon, but has never seen broad popularity in Chital, leading many Southern activists and even Olenian traditionalists to decry the move as an imposition of a foreign cultural tradition upon a nation with a rich sporting history of its own. Olenians have recommended deer hockey as a new national sport for Chital, while Hindians have countered with the suggestion of Kabaddi, a classical tackle sport of Hindia, but neither are too keen on the idea of imposing hoofball for hoofball's sake, regardless of the sport's popularity internationally.\n\nThe Kansleri has used his clear majority in parliament to pass the initiative as it stands, but large amounts of foreign and domestic money pouring into the league without proper domestic support would only spell a public relations disaster for the Republican Party government. Hoversholm's foreign contacts have encouraged the move to go ahead and the people's game to expand to Chital, but would such a deer of the people risk the empty stadiums and washed-up Riverlander sensations that could turn Chital's hoofball league into a farce?"

The symbols may have been torn down - Benjen V is nowhere to be seen and presumed dead by all but the most conspiratorial of traditionalists, Hira and Bhushan have returned to the shadows and taken the Tuya with them, and Jakob the Grey lies in the halls of the Olenian Pantheon - but the anger remained, and now, new leaders have wrapped their tendrils around the minds of the Chitali people.\n\nIn Ostkranbi, the papers of Benjen's lackey Raili Ninessen and the snake Katarina who bears a Hoversholm name have escaped any attempt at censorship and instead are now in the hooves of every urban elite and Equestrianized academic, and all decry our Kansleri not for his reformism, but his "right-wing socialist, state-promoted social hierarchy and an assimilation of all Chitali with our wonderful differences into a militarized band of republican fanatics standing against all hopes of a harmonic future."\n\nIf such progressive jargon is unappealing, one can only look at what the traditionalists of the East and the Tuya of the South distribute, each painting the Kansleri as a member of the other. He is a viking lord reborn, a devotee of assimilationism, and has publicly admitted to ordering the extrajudicial killings of thousands of Ostkranbi Tuya, yet also has used the Tuya as his own paramilitary force to raid temples of the Olenian Pantheon and sacrificed Jakob the Grey on the altar of his bloodthirsty Goddess, even while simultaneously promoting athiestic thought and announcing the collectivization of hundreds of thousands of acres of noble estates across Chital to be put in the hands of mindless freed thralls.\n\nIf all that were true, at least our Kansleri would have the power to deal with this slander directly, but he has not even been afforded that luxury, as there are now whispers of such Jakobite rhetoric in the army as well. We must take measures to rebuild Hoversholm's personal popularity, if it even existed in the first place, or risk the destruction of the Republican Revolution in Chital before it began."

Everywhere our column went there was a crowd waiting for us, celebrating our arrival as if we've liberated the hearts of our country. They made me a lieutenant during training, so I had the opportunity to lead my platoon, always the first to be cheered by the multitude of smiling faces, waving flags of our country between their hooves. It's all so surreal to remember now. They tell us we're the first generation to rekindle the torch of the household guards and Vikingar of the past; that we're the young faces of the country's maritime Olenian and Hindian military pride. We've yet to prove ourselves, but we were heralded in as heroes; like saviours to Chital.\nAs our division made its way through the increasingly narrow, cobbled streets of the northern city — closer to our barracks — I kept discerning this one face poking out from the sea of thousands: a doe, wearing a green wide brimmed hat, with a half-smile lighting up the corners of her youthful face. She kept looking at me... just at me. She looks so familiar, yet I don't recollect ever meeting her. All I know is she's the one for me, dad. Maybe when my contract's up I can find her waiting for me out here. \nI'll write to you later, father. It's getting dark out and soon it will become impossible to find the time to pen letters. Tomorrow's a big day and I'll need all the rest I can get."

chital_news.1.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]The last steps to truly enshrine Equestrianist harmony as the dominant ideology across all of Hindia were taken today, as Benjen V Kudlinen, Yaril of Chital and staunch reformist, was officially coronated as King Benjen I of Hindia. His Chief Minister and numerous advisors were seen at the event, and have already begun to set the stage to complete the grand task of the unification of such a shattered continent. As the war for the subcontinent came to a close, neither traditionalist Yarildoms or princely federations emerged as the dominant force in the Northeast of Zebrica. Instead, a true democratic and free system reigns, and the Kind Viking has truly established himself as more than just a weak-willed despot with dreams beyond his comprehension."

chital_news.2.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Familiar flags have been raised all across Hindia as the viking Yarildom of Chital has fully reformed itself into the Kingdom of Hindia. Benjen V now stands as Benjen I, Sea-King of all Hindians, but his throne is powerless. Instead, power in Chital and now Hindia lies in Jakob the Grey, the Yaril's premier advisor. A staunch traditionalist and an old war hero, Benjen's uncle has established himself as the most powerful deer in a new viking Hindia guided not by bureaucrats or power-hungry warlords, but by military deer devoted to the values of the past. For the first time in almost 500 years, a reformed and powerful Kingdom has arisen in the Hindian subcontinent worthy of the title of the medieval Sea-Kings."

chital_news.3.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]From originally rather obscure origins in the southern lands of Chital, one deer, Bhushan the Brash, has risen to become Maharaja of a unified Hindian Raj. A brutal but beloved warlord, Bhushan overthrew the Oleno-Hindian government of Chital in favor of a purely native government centralized around the goddess Mahimata and her most militant followers in Chital, the Tuya. A member of the anti-government Axis of Chital before his ascendancy to power, many have certain reservations about Bhushan's ties to spymistress Hira Ramachan. Comparisons to the Storm King or allegations of puppetry aside, none can deny that the imposing Bhushan Gurat has built a powerful and populist Hindia on the backs of his adoring followers, and will surely be a force to be reckoned with."

 CTL_BENJEN_DESC:0 "§YДата Рождения§!: 6 Июня 975 года, в Осткранби\n\n§YБиография§!: Говорят, что нет покоя голове в венце; Про Бенджена V Кудлинена, Ярила Читала и стойкого реформиста лучше и не скажешь: со всех сторон его окружают дворяне-заговорщики, предавшие его бывшие союзники и бессердечные революционеры.\n\nВ отличие от правителей прошлого — Повелителей морей, наводивших ужас на восточные берега Зебрики, покорявших туземных Оленей под своё иго от Самбара до Доули, — Бенджен V никогда не был воином. Он родился в Осткранби, столице Читала, в семье Бенджена IV Кудлинена. С самых юных лет Бенджен-младший обучался управленческим навыкам, и хотя он не был особо усерден в обучении, отец всегда нахваливал сына за ум и красноречие: юный оленёнок быстро находил общий язык не только со многими детьми при дворе, но даже и со знатными оленями постарше. Бенджен оставался таким же общительным и после смерти отца в 998 году, так что с восшествием брата Аатто на трон Ярила Читала он был готов взять на себя обязанности главного советника своего брата.\n\nПравда, жизнь Ярила вскоре резко оборвалась. Аатто погиб в 1001 в ходе подавления восстания аборигенов, так что Бенджену пришлось стать во главе династии Кудлинен. Главные советники разорвали помолвку Бенджена с суженой, простой оленихой, и оставили тому править ярлством, в котором его прозвали толстым управленцем и женоподобным трусом — "Добрым Викингом". Бенджен постепенно заменял советников Аатто своими старыми друзьями, и кульминацией его правления стало учреждение в 1003 году Совета Семи — по задумке, консультативного совета из Хиндийских и Оленийских дворян, верных Ярилу. Увы, его соперники стали сеять возмущение в Совете, и трое самых важных советников организовались в Читальскую Ось, дабы ограничить, как они считают, грубое превышение полномочий и неспособность провести реформы в стране.\n\nРаз уж совет стремительно становится всё более враждебным, Бенджену нужно действовать быстро, если он желает сберечь Читал — и свою династию.\n\n§YАвтор портрета§!: MonAx"

Ныне же он лишь тень прошлого себя, презираемый знатью, поглощённый холодной и тихой ненавистью ко всем предателям, что пришли к власти в его стране.\n\nИвар родился в Хамахольме, в Танстве Вальделанд, в любящей дворянской семье. Его считали одарённым ребёнком, его хвалили и уважали наставники и весь вальделандский двор — всё это приводило в негодование его сестру-близняшку Катарину, впоследствии сыгравшую свою роль в его дальнейшем упадке. Восходящая звезда читальской политики Ивар и его отец Элик стали рупорами реформизма, популизма и законности в совете тогда ещё Ярила Бенджена IV. Когда Элик покинул двор в 1000 году ввиду своего почтенного возраста, влияние Ивара во дворе прибрежной державы возросло ещё больше. Благодаря близкой дружбе с промышленником Бендженом Давиртанненом и наследником трона Бендженом Кудлиненом он стал первым из кандидатов на кресло советника в совете Ярила, вскоре ставшего Советом Семи в 1003 году.\n\nОднако после учреждениея Совета Семи дела Ивара пришли в упадок. Будучи одним из основателей Читальской Оси, Ховерсхольм видел, как Ярил поддерживал, как ему казалось, элитаристские и безжалостные идеи, продвигаемые самозванными дворцовыми реформистами; но Бенджен, к сожалению для Ивара, был глух ко словам советника. По мере того как его влияние подавлялось псевдореформистами, как Ось сдвигалась всё дальше от реформ, всё ещё упорно поддерживаемых Иваром, и как его дружба с Ярилом стала распадаться, сам Ивар всё реже стал посещать Совет, всё больше времени стал проводить в Хамахольме, выдумывая причудливые способы вернуть свою власть и отомстить тем, кто его опозорил.\n\nИ вот наконец-то его мечты начинают воплощаться в реальность.\n\n§YАвтор портрета§!: bunnyshrubby"

 CTL_JAKUB_DESC:0 "§YДата Рождения§!: 8 Июля 943 года, в Канелимпре\n\n§YБиография§!: Якоб "Седой" Кудлинен — младший брат Бенджена IV, преданный и благосклонный дядюшка Бенджена V и его брата Аатто, ныне же — самый могущественный олень во всём Читале.\n\nЯкоб Седой родился на два года позже наследника трона, Бенджена IV Кудлинена, и всегда был эдаким "запасным вариантом" — на трон Ярила Читала, на должнось главнокомандующего читальских флота и армии: наконец, на пост Верховного Министра новообразованного Совета Семи. Когда Бенджен IV порывался привнести индустриальную революцию в земли Читала и подавить социальную — в землях аборигенов, рядом с ним был брат Якоб, получивший блестящее образование в лучших военно-морских академиях Макавии. Когда интернационалист Бенджен IV запретил рейдерские походы, неистовый викинг и налётчик Якоб стал народным героем Читала за борьбу с макавийскими пиратами и хиндийскими повстанцами, увидев своими глазами царствие трёх Ярилов.\n\nНо теперь у Якоба, бойца душою, совсем другая жизнь — в палатах верхних эшелонов правительства он нашёптывает на ухо Бенджену V, заодно продвигая возвращение к традициям, из века в век хранившим величие Читала. Верный идеям своего брата Якоб Кудлинен не старался скрыть своё непринятие реформистских взглядов племянника; имея при этом у себя за спиной радикалов в вооружённых силах, он стал самым влиятельным правым абсолютистом во всей стране.\n\nСумей старый олень удержать баланс между крайне правым генштабом и нетерпимостью к традиционализму всё более неуправляемого Ярила, история запомнит Якоба Седого не только как ветерана многочисленных боёв, но и как величайшего политика нации.\n\n§YАвтор портрета§!: MonAx"

 CTL_HIRA_DESC:0 "§YДата Рождения§!: 22 Ноября 976 года в Хаарихусе\n\n§YБиография§!: Слишком многие читальцы, одарённые благославлением Укко, рождаются в роскоши, не ведая о невзгодах простых оленей.\n\nО Хире Рамачан такого не скажешь. Хире удалось вырваться из всеобщей безвестности и нищеты, даже стать влиятельной среди южан после назначения её отца Джхери мэром Хаарихуса — в те самые времена, когда Аатто вёл походы по умиротворению южных князей. Она была послана в Осткранби молить о помощи всем бывшим рабам и обездоленным местным жителям, находящимся в ведении её отца, и попалась на глаза тогда ещё Кронпринцу Бенджену Кудлинену. После гибели брата, Бенджен V нашёл в молодой слуге народа верного союзника, не подверженного влиянию престарелых чиновников-традиционалистов, которыми некогда окружил себя Аатто.\n\nОднако Хира стала не просто послушным тайным советником. На миссиях по искоренению южан-предателей она находила себе скрытых союзников из движения сопротивления, а Бенджену сообщала, что с теми "полный порядок"; на заданиях по раскрытию дворцовых заговоров она обнаруживала массу компромата на каждого члена читальского Совета Семи — само собой, Бенджен получал лишь крохи информации.\n\nТеперь Хира продолжает строить свои коварные планы как лидер Читальской Оси. Объединив вокруг себя южных повстанцев, опальных дворян, задобренных чиновников и честных популистов, тайная советница надёжно закрепила свою власть над страной.\n\nВыстроит ли она царство справедливости и взаимопонимания или просто сменит баланс политических сил ради личной выгоды — неизвестно. Ведь выбор, в конечном счёте, за ней самой.\n\n§YАвтор портрета§!: Memerskai"

Последователи Туя — военизированного религиозного ордена богини-праматери всех хиндийцев Махиматы — активно боролись против оленийского пантеона богов с того момента, как Бхушан возглавил ещё слабую организацию полемизирующих теологов, что тогда носила это имя.\n\nГурат, один из самых могущественных южных князей в Читале, был назначен в Совет Семи, чтобы умиротворять своих подданных в провинции Махорна, составляющей немалую часть коренного хиндийского населения — и вскоре сам стал гласом своего народа. Многие видят в молодом, дерзком и не особо рассудительном Бхушане политического шарлатана, играющего с огнём и с идеями чересчур великими для его же ума; немногие, впрочем, будут сомневаться насчёт его убеждений: его ревностного читальского патриотизма, его любви к оленям своей страны — и его намерений привнести небесную праматерь в Осткранби, сколько бы крови ни пришлось ради этого пролить.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: MonAx"

Past the initial excitement, life was warm, life was pleasant, and life was boring. That was until a hostile CPLF incursion swept through the locality.\n\nWith the spirit of adventure burning boldly within, Vaalan decided he might as well try his own hoof at dealing with the issue, and left everything behind to roam the area in search of the raiders. He followed their movements, harassing and sabotaging them around the clock, using whatever means he had at his disposal. Vaalan was always careful to disappear away into the brush when things got too troublesome, until finally the group retreated.\n\nOnce he realized he actually had a knack for this kind of work, Vaalan began to informally organize and offer joint ventures with others who had also suffered from beasts, bandits, or other groups, growing bolder and traveling further by the operation. Almost all of his time was spent somewhere out in the wilds. Eventually, his antics got to be enough that a local noble presented him with an ultimatum: To either put his skills to use with a generously given commission into the Chitali military, or be hunted down himself as an outlaw subverting Chitali authority.\n\nThe choice, though sudden, was simple enough, and with time, Vaalan turned his lowly commission into a respectable rank.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Truffle Shine\n §YAdditions by§!: AquaMuro"

Living his early life in luxury, he grew up among his father's serfs, but soon began to notice the cruelty with which they were treated, and couldn't help feel a pang of emotion in his heart for them. Spending time with them, learning their stories and their lives, he grew close to many of them, and decided he would do everything he could to help.\n\nWith these sympathies, it was no wonder that when offered a chance to study at a military academy in New Mareland, he seized his chance. Finally he could spend time in a land a friendship and harmony, hopefully something he could import back home. Compared to his home... it was like comparing a flower to axe. But he always knew he would need to return home eventually, and try to implement what he had learned. As he finished his studies he recieved a letter from home, his father was dead, killed along with Yaril Aatto in another battle of the never-ending wars against the native populations. Now the owner of his father's estates and riches, he made some changes. Doing far more to help the lives of those who worked under him.\n\nJust the same, he began learning about the new Yaril, Benjen V. He was pessimistic at first, but as he heard more  of "the Kind Viking", he decided he needed to see the deer for himself. Offering his military services, and touting his foreign training, Benjen accepted him into the General Staff.

When her father went to war to fight for Yaril Aatto, Eva remained as a de-facto regent, and began to take over the economic matters of the city as well. Her university-trained business expertise and a flood of Equestrian and Macawian advisors brought unprecedented growth to Gondeerana as market outreach and investment soared.\n\nWhen her father was eventually killed in the same doomed assault that brought an end to Yaril Aatto's reign, Eva, only Lady of Gondeerana in her own right for a few days, was immediately invited to Benjen V's new council, and from then on, has continued to serve as a stalwart defender of cultural unity, cosmopolitan ideals, and unbridled capitalism.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Egil"

 ### IDEOLOGIES ###
 
 CTL_socialism_desc:0 "Hoversholmism is a branch of social democracy that promotes aspects of political authoritarianism and the supremacy of the executive for the purpose of achieving reformist socialism in developing countries, such as those of the Hindian subcontinent. Although more authoritarian than classical harmonic democracries, Hoversholmists believe that after the initial period of "state developmentalism", true populism can emerge in which a strong, stable, watchful government can anchor policies below the national level based on direct democracy, decentralization, subsidiarity, and above all, solidarity."

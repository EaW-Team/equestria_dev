STL_new_army_desc:0 "Griffons to the north, Our 'Friend' to the south, and the giant of Equestria beyond that, looking to swallow us both. Our citizens must take up arms for safety, for the sad truth is that a bullet is the ultimate equaliser."

STL_demand_griffon_land_desc:0 "We have gotten so used to referring to everything as 'Ours', that it’s starting to get out of control. “Our caves”, “Our mountains”, “Our northern coasts”. The idea of asking Nova Griffonia to give us all that land is getting very tempting. After all, it IS Ours."

starlight.1.t:0 "An Offer from Stalliongrad"
starlight.1.d:0 "Stalliongrad has successfully ended their food and political crises and looks to be once again on the road to prosperity. They have formally invited us become part of their nation."
starlight.1.a:0 "It was bound to happen..."
starlight.1.b:0 "Our Town, not yours!"

starlight.2.t:0 "The Return"
starlight.2.d:0 "The Communist Civil War in Equestria is not something that any pony could miss. Especially given the pony involved. So when we heard that the communists won, we knew they would be coming.\n\nI sat, hiding behind my tiny fortifications, waiting to see what they would do - bomb us, send an ambassador, or even starve us out.\n\nInstead, they sent one pony. THAT pony.\n\nStarlight Glimmer. Unescorted, Unruffled, Uncertain. Walking towards us.\n\nWe stared. The leader of the most powerful nation in the world, and our old Mayor. Beside me, Sugar Belle flinched and raised her rifle slightly, recalling trauma of muffins past.\n\n Starlight coughed. "So... it’s been a while, hasn't it? Time, uh, flies... when you're running a war, you know?" She taps the ground nervously with her hoof. "So, we did it. Equality. No stealing cutie marks. No lies. Just... fairness." She looked away, eyes tearing. "I owe every one of you an apology for what I've done. You believed in Equality! Even when I didn't. You held true. Everything we did, it started with you."\n\n She took a deep breath. "Even if you never forgive me... Will you join us? Will you help bring true Equality to Equestria? Teach the ponies of this land what we did, what we can do? Will you help us lead Our Nation?"\n\nShe rushed on "You can say no. Really. We'll leave you alone." I glanced doubtfully at the leader of one of the largest military powers on the planet, before I looked at my fellow ponies. Even with no time to consider, even with the war, the sheer insanity of it all, we knew the answer..."
starlight.2.a:0 "Welcome home, Starlight!"
starlight.2.b:0 "Leave, Starlight Glimmer, and never return."

starlight.3.t:0 "The End of Our Town"
starlight.3.d:0 "We have begun the painful process of beginning anew. Old signs and banners torn down, portraits of Starlight Glimmer burned, and old talents embraced again. Some ponies left the village, never to return. Others sat silently, staring into the flaming portraits of the best pony.\n\nBut at the end of it all, Double Diamond spoke. Of a New Equality. Maybe not an equality of cutie marks, but certainly of friendship, of work, of fairness. This was an Equality that could be believed in - even the Stalliongradians were making similar ideas work.\n\nThe ponies who had stuck by Double Diamond nodded and murmured in approval, and one by one left for their beds. Our Town was no more. Could New Equality work in an unkind world?"
starlight.3.a:0 "It's a start, at least."

starlight.4.t:0 "A Pro-Stalliongrad Policy"
starlight.4.d:0 "Double Diamond was elected as the new leader and we must pursue closer cooperation with our friendly neighbouring state, Stalliongrad. We can have their advisors and officers, helping with our military and professional constructors to observe our industrial build-up."
starlight.4.a:0 "Excellent."

starlight.5.t:0 "Message to Stalliongrad"
starlight.5.d:0 "Our representative delivered our message expressing the near unanimous desire for independence amongst the ponies of Our Town. The Stalliongrad ambassador frowned, and then forced a smile, expressing his understanding and reiterating their commitment to a society of equality."
starlight.5.a:0 "It could've been worse."

starlight.6.t:0 "Industrial Delegation Departs"
starlight.6.d:0 "We have sent a small delegation to request industrial assistance from Stalliongrad. We wish them our best."
starlight.6.a:0 "Its up to Stalliongrad now."

starlight.7.t:0 "Military Delegation Departs"
starlight.7.d:0 "We have sent a small delegation to request military assistance from Stalliongrad. We wish them our best."

starlight.9.t:0 "The Town Debates"
starlight.9.d:0 "The ponies of Our Town debate their future. Ideas are sketched, philosophies argued, examples shown. A little bit of the old passion has returned, as ponies grapple with the question of the tomorrow they wish to live in. Ultimately consensus boils down to two paths - following in the footsteps of Equestria, or Stalliongrad."
starlight.9.a:0 "Its good to see interest reignited."

starlight.10.t:0 "Military Investments See Results"
starlight.10.d:0 "Much to our surprise, our increasing investment in the armed forces has seen strong results. Drilling, marching side by side, and putting aside fear for the greater good comes naturally to Equal ponies, leading to a fine fighting force.\n\nPonies who once looked at a rifle in horror now fire, load and charge with precision, finding comfort in their part of a greater whole."
starlight.10.a:0 "MREs are still better than our old muffins."

starlight.11.t:0 "The Delegation Returns"
starlight.11.d:0 "The defeated postures of our delegation told us the before anypony could speak. Stalliongrad had rejected our proposal for industrial assistance."
starlight.11.a:0 "Are they really Our Friends?"

starlight.12.t:0 "Stalliongrad Response"
starlight.12.d:0 "Stalliongrad has accepted our request for military support, providing a team of advisors to help train, organise and design our divisions."
starlight.12.a:0 "Excellent."

starlight.13.t:0 "Stalliongrad Response"
starlight.13.d:0 "Stalliongrad has denied our request for military advice, citing the difficulties we would have in fielding any substantive military force. They have not so subtly reminded us that should we join Stalliongrad, we would be under their full military protection"
starlight.13.a:0 "Et tu, Comrade?"

#election
starlight.14.t:0 "Preparing for an Election"
starlight.14.d:0 "The remaining ponies of Our Town have agreed - election shall be the way forward. Candidates have been invited to submit their names and two choices have emerged.\n\nThe first is Double Diamond, current defacto leader and the second in command after Starlight Glimmer. He speaks of the need to rebuild a New Equality, with cutie marks, based around fairness, friendship and equality. He notes the success of the neighbour Stalliongrad in their similar ideology. If Stalliongrad can succeed, why not in the birthplace of Equality?\n\nThe other is Feather Bangs. The renowned heartthrob has recently returned from Ponyville in Equestria, he speaks of what he has learnt there - of how Ponyville has seen success in a different way - a way where difference is allowed and balanced with friendship and compromise.\n\nNormally such ideas would be rejected in Our Town, but tired ponies look to him for a way out of their misery, and the shining smile of the town baker Sugar Belle on her trading trips to Ponyville speaks the truth of Feather's words. Others recall the visit of Ponyville Princess Twilight Sparkle, who first exposed Starlight Glimmer's deception."
starlight.14.a:0 "A big choice for a small town..."

starlight.15.t:0 "Election Day"
starlight.15.d:0 "A strange attitude pervades Our Town, of hope and foreboding alike. The candidates shake hooves in a final show of good will, before announcing the polls open.\n\nOne by one, the ballots are cast. The margin is small, but decisive... (Note - Harmonic Path is not available yet)"
starlight.15.a:0 "Double Diamond Wins."
starlight.15.b:0 "Feather Bangs Wins."

#starlight.16.a:0 "Excellent"

starlight.19.t:0 "Townsville Requests Border Lands."
starlight.19.d:0 "Today, diplomats from the city of Townsville arrived, requesting to annex the area just north of them, known as Starlights Cave, along with some accompanying coastline. The area they described is of little tactical value, but does serve as a buffer between us and Stalliongrad."
starlight.19.a:0 "Better to let them handle the communists then us. Let them have their frozen wasteland."
starlight.19.b:0 "And leave ourselves vulnerable to attack? I think not.... Where even is Townsville?"

starlight.20.t:0 "Nova Griffonia Agrees!"
starlight.20.d:0 "Nova Griffonia has agreed to release the lands to our administration, effective immediately."
starlight.20.a:0 "A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one."

starlight.21.t:0 "Nova Griffonia Refuses!"
starlight.21.d:0 "Nova Griffonia practically laughed our diplomats out of the room, telling us to come back when we we are an actual country."
starlight.21.a:0 "Well.. there was no reason to be so rude about it."

starlight.22.t:0 "A Pro-Equestria Policy."
starlight.22.d:0 "Feather Bangs was elected, and with him he brings a Pro-Equestrian policy. Already our diplomats, through covert means, have already managed to get ahold of Princess Celestia, and are requesting protection from inevitable retallation from Stalliongrad. However, the most surprising response came from Stalliongrad. They did not immediately revoke their guarantees and diplomats. However, one advisor did warn us that we could face loss of protection over this."
starlight.22.a:0 "Well, we will have to hope Equestria agrees to shield us."

starlight.23.t:0 "Our Town adopts a Pro-Equestrian policy!"
starlight.23.d:0 "Today, Our Town, now called Townsville, informed us that they will be seeking improved relations with Equestria after the election of Feather Bangs. Despite this outrage, Our Town still serves an important buffer against Nova Griffonia for us. What should we do?"
starlight.23.a:0 "Keep our promises of protection, but nothing more. They will be on their own when it comes to their economy."
starlight.23.b:0 "Revoke our promises of protection. A few months of the griffons breathing down their necks, and they will come crawling back to us."

starlight.24.t:0 "Stalliongrad recalls advisors, maintains military protection."
starlight.24.d:0 "In an expected announcement, Stalliongrad recalled all of its advisors from its borders. However, before they left, in a surprising move, they told us that the promise of protection was still on the table, and to inform them should we require assistance."
starlight.24.a:0 "Well.. that went better then expected. Make sure to thank them on their way out."

starlight.25.t:0 "Stalliongrad recalls advisors and military protection."
starlight.25.d:0 "In an expected announcement today, Stalliongrad recalled all of its advisors from our borders. In addition, as the advisors left, they added "When the Griffons come, we will watch them slaughter you. You will live to regret this decision.""
starlight.25.a:0 "Well, that went about as expected."

starlight.26.t:0 "Townsville requests military protection, advisors."
starlight.26.d:0 "After their recent election, Townsville, previously known as Our Town, elected a pro-equestrian government to office. Their messages have reached us, via covert means, requesting advisors and a gurantee of military protection."
starlight.26.a:0 "Give them what they ask for. Its our duty to help other ponies see the light of harmony."
starlight.26.b:0 "Give them everything except for the guarantee of protection. We can't promise our troops can help that far up north. We can provide them other support though."

starlight.27.t:0 "Equestria agrees to advisor, military protection."
starlight.27.d:0 "Today, after a very short delay, Equestria got back to us regarding our request for protection. They agreed to immediately being sending advisors to us. In addition, they requested we construct an airstrip for the purpose of material transportation."
starlight.27.a:0 "Well, you heard them. Lets get to work!"

starlight.28.t:0 "Equestria agrees to advisors, declines military protection."
starlight.28.d:0 "Citing their distance away from us as the primary issue, Equestria declined to offer us protection today. However, they did say they would assist us in any way possible, including sending us vital supplies and advisors. They recommended we construct an airstrip immediately for this purpose."
starlight.28.a:0 "Disapointing, but we don't have time to think on it. You heard them. We have work to do!"

starlight.30.t:0 "Our Town demands we give up land around their borders!"
starlight.30.d:0 "Citing a need for a buffer space between our nation and theirs, today Our Town requested to immediately be given the land immediately around them, from the area known as Starlights Cave to the locals, all the way to Bjornholm."
starlight.30.a:0 "Give them what they want. We can't afford a war with Stalliongrad at the moment."
starlight.30.b:0 "Tell them they will get nothing from us."

starlight.31.t:0 "Nova Griffonia gives in to our demands!"
starlight.31.d:0 "Citing a desire to keep the peace, Nova Griffonia has turned over all the land we requested to our administration, effective immediately."
starlight.31.a:0 "A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one."

starlight.32.t:0 "Nova Griffonia refuses!"
starlight.32.d:0 "Our delegation to Nova Griffonia was told in no uncertain terms that we would be getting nothing from them, and then asked to leave the country immediately."
starlight.32.a:0 "Well, thats about what we expected.. Well, I suppose we will prepare to do this the hard way, then."

starlight.29.t:0 "A Short Trip"
starlight.29.d:0 "Today, after the opening of our new line leading directly to an airstrip near Ponyville, Sugar Bell, the Ambassador to Equestria, departed for unknown reasons. All that is known is that she said she had a deal to close in Ponyville, and that she would return shortly. It is currently unknown what this deal consists of, or how it will effect our nation."
starlight.29.a:0 "I hope its a good one."

starlight.17.t:0 "A Simple Proposal"
starlight.17.d:0 "Sugar Belle looked unsure as she stepped down off of the plane onto the Airstrip. She wasn't sure if she would find what she was looking for here in Ponyville, but she knew she had to try, as he once had. She started by heading towards the most likely location for the stallion she was seeking, taking off at a light gallop towards Sweet Apple Acres. \n\nAfter a short trip, she arrived, huffing very slightly as she looked around, trying to see if what she was looking for was there. It wasn't. However, she did run into an orange mare, with a red apple cutie mark. She sighed as they exchanged a short greeting, a brief conversation, and then parted ways. Looking dejected, her head remained held downwards as she walked out of the large apple farm. Not paying much attention to where she went as she ended up bumping straight into a large red Stallion as she headed back towards the Airstrip. \n\nShe looked up with a big smile, saying nothing as she hurriedly reached into her saddle bags. Finally, she spoke. “Big Mac! I have been looking everywhere for you.. I, um.. was wondering if you would...” She hesitate as she slowly opened up the box she had brought with her. Before she could even finish opening it all the way, Big Mac would press it close, and give a simple, one word response."
starlight.17.a:0 ""Eeyup.""

starlight.18.t:0 "A Wedding"
starlight.18.d:0 "In Townville's sister town of Ponyville today, our very own ambassador, Sugar Belle, will be getting married to Big MacIntosh Apple, of Sweet Apple Acres. With the proceedings expected to be attended by no less then two princesses of Equestria, and prosided over by Princess Twilight Sparkle herself. With the marriage comes benefits to Townville in general. Effective immediately, we will be expanding our airstrip with a second landing strip. As well, we are going to be having some new visitors. The first shippping up for Sweet Apple Acres will be opening up here, right in Townsville, in a few weeks, to allow their products to be shipped further up north. In addition, Townsville has recieved a truely stagering number of phonecalls from Equestrian Buisnesses, wishing to open up branches in Our Town."

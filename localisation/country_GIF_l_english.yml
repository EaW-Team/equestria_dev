 ### Ideas ###
 
 GIF_repairing_twinzanbwe:0 "Repairing Twizanbwe"
 GIF_repairing_twinzanbwe_desc:0 "Following the raid of one of the Storm King's generals in 1002, large portions of the capital of Twizanbwe and its gold mines were damaged. Since then, a monumental repair effort has been put in motion, costing us significantly. The Raid has also damaged the Twizanbwean dynasty’s prestige, making the efforts even more important."
 GIF_trade_with_kompels:0 "Trade With The Kompels"
 GIF_trade_with_kompels_desc:0 "Since the arrival of the griffon Kompels centuries ago east of Twizanyika, the giraffes have enjoyed a friendly trade relationship with them, exchanging goods through the decades. As the Kompels slowly became the most industrialized nation on this part of Zebrica, Twizanyika experienced the arrival of industrial goods, for better or worse. However, with the Storm King's and his general's campaigns through Zebrica, trade northwards has been disrupted; and the giraffes' trade relationship with the Kompels has become dependent, greatly delaying modernisation efforts in the High Kingdom."
 GIF_individual_armies:0 "The Kingdoms' Armies"
 GIF_individual_armies_desc:0 "Twizanyika lacks a centralized military, instead relying on the armies of its individual Kingdoms and their vassals. While this worked in the past, and some giraffes may fight better for their homes, it is entirely unsuitable for the modern era."
 GIF_traditionalists_angered:0 "Traditionalists Displeased"
 GIF_traditionalists_angered:0 "Our recent actions have caused the more traditionalist powerful giraffes in Twizanyika to be displeased with Retikula's rule. We must watch this carefully, before it gets out of hoof."
 GIF_traditionalists_angered_2:0 "Traditionalists Angered"
 GIF_traditionalists_angered_2_desc:0 "More transgressive actions by us has now caused the traditionalist giraffes to be angered at our government. We are beginning to lose their support for our rule, but they remain largely loyal... for now."
 GIF_traditionalists_angered_3:0 "Traditionalists Greatly Angered"
 GIF_traditionalists_angered_3_desc:0 "Our further actions have greatly angered the traditionalists giraffes within Twizanyika, and some are even starting to support treacherous factions! We must rectify this at once."
 GIF_gold_rush:0 "Digging Gold"
 GIF_gold_rush_desc:0 "A small gold rush has been initiated in Twizanbwe as a consequence of the High King's promise of wealth to the common giraffe."

 ### Decisions ###
 
 GIF_dzinashi_coup:0 "The Plot"
 GIF_dzinashi_coup_desc:0 "High King Retikula, and especially the Twizanbwean dynasty, have proven that they have lost the capability to rule Twizanyika effectively. We have grown dependent on the griffons to the east, delaying our modernisation; and they have failed to protect their own capital from foreign raids, losing much wealth and prestige in the process. It is clear, that there is a need for a change in Twizanyika. And King Dzinashe III of Matanda is willing to be that change. He just needs to wait and slowly build his plot support - and then, strike.\n\n\nCurrent §YPlot Power§!: [GIF.GetPlotPower]."

 ### Leaders ###
 
 GIF_high_king_retikula_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 2nd of February, 952 in Twizanbwe.\n\n§YBiography§!: Retikula was born as the first child of the Twizanbwean King, and by consequence the High King of Twizanyika, Samhuri III. Taking his grandfather's name, the young Retikula was raised as a calf to be the perfect example of Twizanbwe's traditions and prestige over the rest of the giraffe Kingdoms. He was taught the basics and the advanced arts of combat necking; the history of Twizanyika and Twinzanbwe; the matters of administration; and how to be a faithful giraffe of the Gods Ivhu and Zuva.\n\nWhen his father died in 978 ALB, Retikula ascended to the Great Twizanbwe's throne as High King Retikula II, vowing to embody the same traditions and beliefs he had been raised in. Retikula's rule was peaceful and uneventful for the first decade or so, as Twizanyika prospered from trade and the rest of the Twizanyikan Kingdoms were under the rule of friendly or neutral monarchs. But when one of the Storm King's generals raided Twizanbwe in 1002 ALB, everything took a turn for the chaotic. A large portion of the city's gold and luxuries were pillaged by the raiders, and Great Twizanbwe's walls were damaged by the attackers.\n\nRetikula has now the spent the last years steering the High Kingdom's repair efforts, and dealing with the damaged prestige and stolen wealth his lands have suffered. Most recently, he has called a meeting of the Grand Council of Twizanyika, where the four monarchs of the giraffes all meet to discuss and agree on the affairs and actions of the High Kingdom. Retikula is trying to use this as a catalyst for change in Twizanyika, as the recent experiences have convinced the giraffe that the country must modernise and industralize in the coming years if Twizanyika were to have a future as an independent nation."
 
 
 ### Advisors and Concerns ###
 
 GIF_guilds_concern:0 "Zuveran Architects' Guild"
 
 
 
 ### Focuses ###
 
 GIF_first_tree_begin:0 "Convene The Grand Council"
 GIF_first_tree_begin_desc:0 "With the year 1007 just beginning, High King Retikula has convened the Grand Council of Twizanyika's monarchs. There are many issues that need to be dealt with, and fast."
 GIF_visit_zuvera:0 "A Visit To Zuvera"
 GIF_visit_zuvera_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Zuvera has always been, and always will be, Twizanbwe's most faithful ally in Twizanyika. In order to strengthen this historic friendship, and to keep our support in the Council, a visit to queen Kudzaishe in Zuvera is in good order."
 GIF_the_coal_issue:0 "The Coal Problem"
 GIF_the_coal_issue_desc:0 "Recently, large deposits of coal have been found by Zuveran miners in the foothills of the Gurnam mountains. While historically we haven't had much use for it, coal is a vital resource needed to power up industry. Trade-minded giraffes have proposed an export deal to the Kompels, while detractors argue it will only increase our dependence on the griffons."
 GIF_talk_with_the_guilds:0 "A Meeting With The Guilds"
 GIF_talk_with_the_guilds_desc:0 "The stonemason and architect guilds of Zuvera are amongst the most powerful and prestigious of Twizanyika. More than a century ago, they helped to build the wonders of Great Twizanbwe, and today continue to supply our nation will experienced and capable giraffes. High King Retikula has decided that a meeting with them would be good - perhaps they would help to restore Twizanbwe, as their ancestors did many years ago."
 GIF_the_military_issue:0 "Patch Up The Military Issue"
 GIF_the_military_issue_desc:0 "The recent experiences with Boltrus' raid as well as the news of conflicts elsewhere in Zebrica and the world have shown that our military is incapable of fighting a modern war. Or rather, our militaries. Twizanyika lacks a centralized fighting force, instead relying on the armies of its individual Kingdoms. Some giraffes have proposed changing this, but to traditionalists' anger, of course."
 GIF_new_walls:0 "Repair The Walls"
 GIF_new_walls_desc:0 "While we have made good progress on repairing the walls of Great Twinzanbwe in the last years, the truth is that it is taking too long - and this has hurt our prestige immensely. But no more. With a final push of extra workers and funding, we will finally finish repairing the walls of our capital and restore them to even better conditions that they had in 1002."
 GIF_new_gold_rush:0 "A New Gold Rush?"
 GIF_new_gold_rush_desc:0 "Our surveyors in the Kuchamhembe mountains have come back with the report of more gold deposits deeper underground. While this would do well to fill our treasury back and cover costs, there are concerns that it working there would be too unsafe for the miners. In the end, High King Retikula will have to decide whether to exploit this opportunity or not."
 GIF_new_uses_land:0 "Repurposing Pillaged Land"
 GIF_new_uses_land_desc:0 "While on his path entering and leaving Twizanyika, Boltrus also took the opportunity to plunder the few villages and towns he encountered on his way. These lands now remain empty, as their inhabitants had fled from their homes before and after Boltrus came. With this in mind, a debate has emerged in Twizanyika on the use of these lands, which Retikula will need to settle."
 GIF_a_new_temple:0 "The New Temple"
 GIF_a_new_temple_desc:0 "With our push to repair Twizanbwe almost done, the time for the greatest task to be done is here. Twizanbwe's Temple, a grand testament to the prestige of the city's dynasty and the Gods, will also be given an extra workforce push in order to finish its restoration. Once this is done, Twinzanbwe will be great once again."
 GIF_visit_musangano:0 "Visiting Musangano"
 GIF_visit_musangano_desc:0 "The city of Musangano lies to the east, on the confluence of the Goridhe and Gungwa rivers. It is the capital of the eponymous Kingdom, which historically has been seen as the 'lesser' of Twizanyika's monarchies. However in the last decades it has prospered due to the trade with the Kompels, and so it is fitting that Retikula would make a visit to Queen Rungano and her lands."
 GIF_the_new_crops:0 "Talk With The Landowners"
 GIF_the_new_crops_desc:0 "The landowning giraffes of Musangano have gained quite a fame in the last years for pioneering new crops beyond the traditional acacia orchards, even gaining the support of Queen Rungano for this. While this is fine, some acacia farmers and landowners have grumbled at this, claiming to be replaced. Maybe it is time for Retikula to take a look at this and mediate?"
 GIF_crime_border:0 "The Revai Trial"
 GIF_crime_border_desc:0 "The trial of Revai ye Yero, a minor noble inside Musangano, has divided his native Kingdom for the last few months. What was initially a local matter quickly turned into a national one as the giraffe's trial became an even more political and divisive matter. Seeking an end of this, Retikula's ruling has been invoked - the High King will now have to decide and take a stance in this matter."
 GIF_discuss_with_matanda:0 "Discuss With Dzinashe"
 GIF_discuss_with_matanda_desc:0 "The King of Matanda, Twizanbwe's historical rival, has become more of a worry in the last months. Rumours have it that he's plotting against Retikula's rule, seeking to topple him from power. The High King has decided to take matters into his own hooves, and requested Dzinashe's presence in neutral ground to discuss matters. "
 GIF_adjourn_the_council:0 "Adjourn The Grand Council"
 GIF_adjourn_the_council_desc:0 "The more urgent matters of the last months have been taken care off to some extent, and Twizanbwe is now fully repaired. With this done, we can finally hold a final meeting of the Grand Council, to adjourn it for the year."
 
 ### Events ###
 
 twizanyika.1.t:0 "The Opening Of The Grand Council"
 twizanyika.1.d:0 "Unlike the many other years the High King of Twizanyika invoked a meeting of the nation's Grand Council, this time this proclamation did not involve much show. In the last weeks, the distinct monarchs of the High Kingdom had received simple letters, with only the light-red stamping signifying the Royal Seal of Twizanyika on it, telling them that High King Retikula II had convened the Grand Council in Twizanbwe.\n\nAnd so it was. First to arrive was Kudzaishe VII, the Queen of Zuvera, Twinzanbwe's historical ally through Twizanyikan history. Kudzaishe also arrived with a group of Zuveran architects, eager to work on the restoration project of the capital's Temple. The Queen's arrival was met with much enthusiasm from the city's inhabitants, as her entourage passed through the still-damaged commercial centre of the city. Entering the High King's residence, she was given a warm welcome by Retikula and his family alike, and both High King and Kudzaishe talked and discussed privately for many hours about the current state of Twizanyika, and the world at large.\n\nSecond to arrive was Rungano V, the Queen of Musangano, committed to upholding her Kingdom's reputation of neutrality and status-quo upholding. Though it is the less prestigious of the four Kingdoms, Musangano has prospered in the last years as trade with the griffon Kompels to the east increased in quantity. With her entourage came a group of Musangano's top merchants, wearing extravagant golden rings around their necks and legs, who months before vowed to invest more of their money into Twizanbwe's reconstruction efforts. Retikula met with these giraffes, thanking them for their investment promise, before also privately discussing with Queen Rungano; the giraffe particulary concerned about the future of Twizanyika's trade partnership with the Vrystaat.\n\nLast to come was Dzinashe III, the King of Matanda, Twizanbwe's historical rival. Unlike the other monarchs, Dzinashi did not arrive with any other entourage; instead only being escorted by a detachment of Matanda's Royal Guard, wearing simple ceremonial dressings. Dzinashi arrived and discussed shortly with Retikula, before both giraffes left for the Grand Council's meeting.\n\nThe issues that face Twizanyika are many at the moment: the issue of the trade with the Kompels, repairing Twizanbwe, and a myriad of other problems normally not important; but with the current political situation they now take the front seat in the giraffes' discourse. It is clear that this Grand Council meeting will perhaps be the most important in decades, if not the entire history of Twizanyika."
 twizanyika.1.a:0 "There's so much to do..."
 
 twizanyika.2.t:0 "A Visit To Zuvera"
 twizanyika.2.d:0 "One of High King Retikula's first locations to visit in Twizanyika was, of course, the Kingdom of Zuvera. Both Twinzanbwe and Zuvera had an historic alliance between each other, dating back even before what is traditionally thought as the beginning of this friendship - that is Zuvera's support of Twizanbwe in the war against Matanda in 803 ALB.\n\nThis alliance instead had its first origins a hundred or so years before that, when two high-ranking members of each dynasty married each other. From there, Zuvera's famous stonemasons woud lay the foundations of what would become Great Twizanbwe two hundred years later. In return, the Twizanbweans rewarded the Zuverans greatly for their support, granting them land from Matanda and giving them second preference in the gold trade - which had been monopolized by Twizanbwe following the unification of the giraffes in 803 ALB. This partnership continues to this day, seemingly unbreakable.\n\nThis was even more reaffirmed by Retikula's visit to Zuvera. As the High King and his entourage travelled from Twizanbwe and down the Gungwa River towards his destination, he passed by several towns and villages along the way, the giraffes living in them not wasting their perhaps once-in-a-lifetime chance of seeing the High King of Twizanyika.\n\nAs the High King entered the city, he was met with much fanfare, from either its inhabitants or Zuvera's Royal Guard. Queen Kudzaishe welcomed Retikula, before treating him and his entourage with a lavish lunch. Following this, both monarchs attended the city's stadium for the Combat Necking events; hoof-picked by Retikula to be held on this day, as he is a fan of the sport. The matches were preceded by a joint parade between the Zuveran and Twizanbwean Royal Guards, accompanied by traditional dancers and singers. The highlight of this was when the Twizanbweans put their twelve bronze cannons on full display, using them to end the ceremony with a bang.\n\nAt night, a great dinner was held, attended by a large number of important giraffes and nobles. The Guild heads, particulary, were interested in meeting the High King personally; which he accepted at a later date. Near the end of the dinner, the High King raised a cup full of imported Aquileian wine, and cleared his throat - bringing the entire party's attention. Then, he began to speak, and proclaimed:"

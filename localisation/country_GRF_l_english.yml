GRF_beak_mines_desc:0 "The Beak Mountains are rich with minerals, minerals necessary to industrialise our nation. While the Beak Mountains have a number of smaller private owned mines, they hardly have the capacity to supply our fledgling nation. If we wish to see any progress, we must form a central mining company that shall carefully and in a somewhat organised manner, extract the resources found on the mountainside."
GRF_dulli_mines:0 "Dulli Mines"
GRF_dulli_mines_desc:0 "The Dulli Mountains are a barely inhabited, but mineral rich strip of land. Opening up mines there would certainly be profitable, but we should remember to invest in some warm clothes for the workers."

GRF_dubious_friends_desc:0 "Goldfeather has always been a bit of a shifty fellow, but no one can deny that him and his "friends" get results, and as long as he gets results; there is no reason to crack down on him or his friends."
GRF_interesting_friends:0 "Triton's Associates"
GRF_interesting_friends_desc:0 "It seems that Triton's arrival in the Northern Provinces has drawn in Republicans from back home, even though they all seem to hold more loyalty towards Blackpeak then the actual government, their arrival has greatly helped expand the industry in the North."

GRF_remove_falcons_desc:0 "The Militant wing of the fascist FfIfG, the Falcons of Griffonstone as they call themselves, has long been a thorn in our side, and the populace is frightened by these thugs roaming around in the streets.

GRF_what_in_the_god_damn:0 "Wildcard"
GRF_what_in_the_god_damn_desc:0 "While many advocate to maintain a authoritarian government, and argue who should lead said government, it would instead be better to relax our grip on the citizens, and let them act freely. Skeiron Goldfeather, one of the richest Griffons in Nova Griffonia and our leading economic advisor, is a true captain of Nova Griffonian industry, and he would be more than willing to lead this new government."
GRF_privatize_healthcare:0 "Privatise Healthcare"
GRF_privatize_healthcare_desc:0 "The state has better things to pay for than healthcare for all. Instead, only those who can actually afford it should be granted healthcare. The rich gain the most and best healthcare. Those who lack the money will simply have to be more careful nowadays."
GRF_abolish_income_tax:0 "Abolish the Income Tax"
GRF_abolish_income_tax_desc:0 "The Income Tax, as it stands, is nothing but legalised theft, during which the state sucks dry its citizens. No more! Our citizens should be allowed to keep the money they so desperately worked for."
GRF_privatize_education:0 "Privatise the Education System"
GRF_privatize_education_desc:0 "The state has no business in the education of the next generation. Privatisation of the education system would do well, seeing as how companies and private investors could put more funds into schools than the state could ever have!"
GRF_illegal_experimentation:0 "Dubious Experiments"
GRF_illegal_experimentation_desc:0 "Our scientists should not be restricted by fancy, unnecessary "ethics". Science must be allowed to roam freely, so that all possibilities can be explored and examined."
GRF_mcnuke:0 "Recreational Nuclear Weapons"
GRF_mcnuke_desc:0 "While some people might see it as dangerous, allowing nuclear weapons to be built, bought and maintained by private investors and companies will only encourage further competition in the free market, AND it will deter foreign forces, as well.

GRF_revoke_labour_laws:0 "No More Labour Laws"
GRF_revoke_labour_laws_desc:0 "Labour laws are unjust and hinder employers in their rightful ability to deal with their employees as they see fit. If an employee does not want to work under the conditions the employer puts him under, why doesn't he just leave and find a better job? Easy as that!"
GRF_unhindered_industrailisation:0 "Unhindered Industrialisation"
GRF_unhindered_industrailisation_desc:0 "In order to further our national industry, we must sooner or later be forced to make sacrifices. In this case, some of our workers shall be forced out of their houses, which will consequently be demolished so that factories can be built there."

GRF_private_armies:0 "Private Armies"
GRF_private_armies_desc:0 "A national army is nonsense. A state cannot simply force citizens into service like it has in the past. Instead, companies and other influential figures shall be allowed to raise their own private armies, so long as they can pay for the maintenance of course. What they actually do with this army is, obviously, up to them. But that's not really our problem."
GRF_the_power_of_money:0 "The Power of Money!"
GRF_the_power_of_money_desc:0 "Through the power of money, one can achieve anything! With money, you can fullfill any dream in an instant, and more! The state and the nation shall strive towards only one goal: Making the most profit."

GRF_the_falcons_march_desc:0 "Reyhard Ironclaw and his Party of Griffon Interests (FfIfG for short) have been on the radar of the government for a long time now. They are well-known radicals who wish to further the interests and well-being of griffons and griffons only, while ruthlessly exploiting other races. And now, it seems they might finally take power by force."
GRF_legalize_falcons:0 "Officialise the Falcons"
GRF_legalize_falcons_desc:0 "With the FfIfG in power, there is no need to pretend that the Falcons are not under our direct command. With their help, we have gained power, and with their continued aid, we shall hold onto it!"
GRF_labour_camps:0 "Establish Labour Camps"
GRF_labour_camps_desc:0 "By establishing labour camps, we can swiftly remove undesirables, such as traitors and political enemies, from our society.

GRF_nationalization:0 "Mass Nationalisation"
GRF_nationalization_desc:0 "Private ownership is a mistake that must be corrected at once. Private owners are wasteful and ill-coordinated, and don't know what is best for all. By nationalising the economy, we can truly control the industry and economy, and better adjust it to our needs."
GRF_local_democracy:0 "Democracy for the Griffons"
GRF_local_democracy_desc:0 "Highhill's coup and the following period under the military junta had effectively silenced any sign of democracy in the country, and the people are now eager to regain their voice in politics.

GRF_haukland_plan:0 "The Haukland Plan"
GRF_haukland_plan_desc:0 "With full control over the Hauklands, our plan can commence.

There, they shall be worked to death, never to return to our glorious and pure country."
GRF_the_great_northern_war:0 "The Great Northern War"

GRF_slavery:0 "Slavery"
GRF_slavery_desc:0 "We now govern over previously foreign subjects, many of which are not even Griffons. Obviously, they shall not be made citizens of our new Order, but instead be forced into slavery. With this new cheap labour force, we can drastically increase our economic prospects."
GRF_crown_highhill_desc:0 "Following the death of Governor Teafether, Erwin Highhill was the very first to jump in and secure order in Nova Griffonia.

GRF_crown_ironclaw:0 "A New Imperator"
GRF_crown_ironclaw_desc:0 "Through fierce, merciless power, Ironclaw has made it clear to us that it is he who knows best, and that he will stop for nobody to secure glory for Nova Griffonia. Let us march onwards, to claim and carve out a new Empire for ourselves! Long live Imperator Ironclaw!"

GRF_protect_the_working_class:0 "Protect The Working Class"
GRF_protect_the_working_class_desc:0 "In our liberalization of society, we must make sure that we do not forget the common griffons in the fields and in the streets. They must not be unfairly exploited by their superiors. Freedom of opportunity must be ensured, by law if necessary."
GRF_tax_breaks:0 "Tax Breaks"
GRF_tax_breaks_desc:0 "To properly kick our economy into gear, and to make sure that we will soon have a flourishing consumer market, we will initiate a large number of tax breaks.

GRF_support_small_business:0 "Support For The Small Griffon"
GRF_support_small_business_desc:0 "And so we arrive at our goal, a place where every family will have a chicken in their pot, a nice house to call their own and a loving family to come home to. Just one last push needs to start the economic boom."

GRF_interparty_cooperation_desc:0 "No Griffon Rules Alone.\n\nThat is as true today as it has always been. To undertake our more ambitious initiatives we must sit down with the NGSDF and FfNGSP to move forward."
GRF_reassure_socialists:0 "A Dinner With Redtail" #void
GRF_reassure_socialists_desc:0 "Redtail is an old Marksist. That much is known publically. Less well-known is that the griffon is also a reasonable person and if we explain our goals to him over a nice, friendly dinner, he will surely become more agreeable to working together with us for now. "
GRF_dismantle_the_falcons:0 "Clip The Falcons' Wings" #void
GRF_dismantle_the_falcons_desc:0 "Now with a strong mandate and Redtail behind us, we can take the next step. The Falcons of Griffonstone, those that enabled and helped the coup go ahead shall meet their end before the courts. It is more mercy than what they ever wished on us."
GRF_linguistic_pluralism:0 "Linguistic Pluralism" #void
GRF_linguistic_pluralism_desc:0 "Nova Griffonia is a nation built on immigrants. Cloudburians, Aquileans, Herzlanders, all have immigrated here to create themselves a better life. While a hybrid of Equestrian and many, many languages has emerged, we will go the step further and accept the many languages spoken here."
GRF_freer_the_markets_freer_the_people:0 "Freer The Market, Freer The People" #void
GRF_freer_the_markets_freer_the_people_desc:0 "The People want to be free. Markets want to be free. But people are dictated by the market. As the markets shift around us, we must make the markets freer to liberate the people in turn, opening up for a new period of prosperity."

GRF_anti_monopoly_laws_desc:0 "Too much of the economy is stuck in grand monopolies that are more concerned with quashing any challengers than providing quality service, and this will not stand.

GRF_old_believer_work_ethic:0 "Old Believer Work Ethic"
GRF_old_believer_work_ethic_desc:0 "While marginalized in Griffonia, the Old Believers have entrenched themselves well here in the new world. Instead of continuing the policy of ignoring them, we should instead look to them and hold up some of the things they do as examples for all to follow. Whether or not they like archons is irrelevant to us but their appreciation for dilligence and honest labor is not."
GRF_support_homesteaders:0 "Support The Homesteaders"
GRF_support_homesteaders_desc:0 "How many hundreds and indeed thousands have bravely set forth into these cold lands to build their homes and carve out a life for themselves? The homesteaders have done so much to prepare the way for further development of the nation, and with the laws that are working their way through the council at the moment they will finally earn the recognition they deserve."
GRF_create_jobs:0 "Jobs For The People"
GRF_create_jobs_desc:0 "To earn a decent living is imperative for our citizens, and if there are not enough jobs to be had, then we should intervene and make sure that more are created. Tax breaks for new hires, apprenticeship programs, invseting in local markets, there's many ways to go about this."
GRF_harmonists_win:0 "The NGSDF Mandate"
GRF_harmonists_win_desc:0 "The Social Democrats stand triumphant in the elections! While some thought that our measured approach to socialism would spell our doom, it instead became our trump card. Now, we shall get to work."

GRF_arrest_the_falcons:0 "Arrest Ironclaw"
GRF_arrest_the_falcons_desc:0 "Highhill was a threat to democracy, and we could only deal with it when he actually struck. We cannot show the Falcons that kind of leniency, for that would end in death and destruction. Thankfully, those thugs are held together by their leader, and the secret police have enough dirt on Ironclaw to put him away for a long time."
GRF_reinforce_judicial_branch:0 "Judicial Reforms"
GRF_reinforce_judicial_branch_desc:0 "Too many in our nation lack proper access to justice, be it through old imperial laws that were dragged along when we arrived, exceptions for various minorities or what have you.

GRF_national_minority_administration:0 "The Nashanal Minoriti Administratyon"
GRF_national_minority_administration_desc:0 "It is, when you think about it, absurd how so many bleat about how griffons tamed these empty lands. They were not empty at all! Yaks, Penguins, Polar Bears and Ponies all lived here when we arrived, and in too many cases their particular interests have not been given due consideration. The National Minority Administration will be tasked with rectifying this."
GRF_urbanisation_campaign:0 "Mass Urbanisation"
GRF_urbanisation_campaign_desc:0 "Too many of our griffons in the inlands are stuck in small frontier villages, and in order to kickstart the economic growth of the Kingsmere as well as the southern areas, we are going to heavily invest in the local urban centres to ensure that the reach of the government will not be stuck just at the coasts. All of Nova Griffonia shall prosper!"

GRF_mass_education_reforms_desc:0 "We can do better, and we shall do better. Disregard those who say "well not everycreature is meant for higher education". Everycreature should have the chance, at least, and none shall ever have to feel they never got the opportunity to better themselves."
GRF_work_with_the_unions:0 "Cooperate With The Unions"
GRF_work_with_the_unions_desc:0 "The Unions have a strong presence in Nova Griffonia, as we seek to implement our policies they can become a quite helpful ally. Concessions will have to be made, but they will be worth it to ensure that the common griff is protected."

GRF_public_works_projects_desc:0 "In part in order to rally the nation and provide work for the unemployed and in part to strengthen the economy, a grand public works project will be undertaken.

GRF_fight_the_falcons:0 "Outlaw The Falcons"
GRF_fight_the_falcons_desc:0 "The Falcons are a one threat beyond all others to Nova Griffonia's future, and we must deal with them posthaste. The Liberals will cry "tyranny", but if tyranny are murderous fascists being locked away to never hurt anygriff else again, then it is the best version of tyranny imaginable."
GRF_cooperate_with_socdems:0 "Cooperate With The NGSDF"
GRF_cooperate_with_socdems_desc:0 "There are some that would denounce the NGSDF as revisionists and traitors to the working class, but there is a difference of degrees, not kind, between us and the Social Democrats. They can still be valuable political allies and it'd be foolish to discard them."
GRF_voting_law_reform:0 "The Referendum Act"
GRF_voting_law_reform_desc:0 "In order to ensure that the average worker will always have a claw in the rule of the nation, the FfNGSP are working to establish a system of direct democracy to work in conjunction with the council."

GRF_nova_griffonian_exceptionalism_desc:0 "This nation built itself where there was nigh nothing, and though the old empire from which it was born fell apart, it has always prevailed. We are not merely distant colonists to some uncaring emperor, we are the best sides of Griffonia and Equus brought together in on nation, and we are proud of this!"
GRF_support_language:0 "Niukultur Movement"
GRF_support_language_desc:0 "Among the species of our nations there are many ideals and cultures. There is much to laud about all of them, but also much to criticize. In order to bring the nation together we should not cling to the archaic ways, but instead seek unity in a new, common Nova Griffonian culture which neither automatically excludes nor elevates anycreature."
GRF_mass_nationalisation:0 "Mass Nationalisation"
GRF_mass_nationalisation_desc:0 "Too many industries are in the claws of capitalists, and most of them are anything but happy with our triumphs. While we could rally for violent a seizure of the means of production, most of them will still be amenable to peaceful nationalization. We will pay enough, and unless a luxurious budget for top hats and bespoke suits is mandatory, they won't need to fear starvation."
GRF_worker_self_managment:0 "Worker Self-Managment"
GRF_worker_self_managment_desc:0 "With the means of production under the control of the people, we can start implementing a new form of labour management in the factories. Gone will be the days of aloof bosses showing up, barking orders and then going back to their offices: now those who know what they are doing will be the ones to manage the industries."
GRF_settle_the_area:0 "Planned Townships"
GRF_settle_the_area_desc:0 "There are endless expanses of land out there, and yet our population is overwhelmingly concentrated at the coastlines in crammed cities that have grown up over time. As we begin expanding our towns and cities we have a great opportunity to plan them thoroughly, both to make them more efficient and make them feel like true communities."
GRF_industrialisation_plan:0 "The Redtail Plan"
GRF_industrialisation_plan_desc:0 "In order to bring Nova Griffonia into the future, our chairgriff has proposed a radical one year plan during which all the efforts of the nation shall be turned to expansion and industry. It will be a stark year for our people, but it will help build our children's future."
GRF_federal_republic:0 "The Federal Republic"
GRF_federal_republic_desc:0 "Nova Griffonia might be young, but she is a world unto herself. We should embrace this and ensure that local autonomy is preserved, not attempt to shoehorn everycreature in under the same overreaching central government."
GRF_unitary_republic:0 "The United Republic"
GRF_unitary_republic_desc:0 "For all of Nova Griffonia's size, she is still one entity, settled by the same people whether north or south, struggling with the same challenges and reaping the same kind of rewards, and so the government shouldn't be scattered and divided, but united and vigorous."
GRF_northern_bloc:0 "Create The Northern Bloc"
GRF_northern_bloc_desc:0 "The world is getting more and more dangerous, and Nova Griffonia sits in the position of being one of the stronger forces in its little corner of the world. We cannot face all the dangers ahead alone though, and neither can our neighbors. That is why it has been proposed that we form an alliance for our mutual security."

GRF_order_frontier:0 "Bring Order to the Griffon Frontier"
GRF_order_frontier_desc:0 "The Frontier has existed for many years now, it is a sparsely populated underdeveloped 'nation' run by bandits and thieves. Virgil needs to be removed from power, the lands of the frontier need to be brought back into civilised society and integrated into our nation."
GRF_invite_PNG:0 "Invite the Penguins to the NRB"
GRF_invite_PNG_desc:0 "Pingland is one of our closest geographical neighbours, they could also be one of our closest allies. We should invite them to the Northern Bloc to start building a mutually beneficial relationship and protect their sovereignty. Shaking talon to wing, we can forge an agreement that will make the world a better place. Let us hope they agree to it."
GRF_invite_PLB:0 "Invite the Polar Bears to the NRB"
GRF_invite_PLB_desc:0 "The polar bears to the west of us, the isolationist bears should be able to see what we have to offer from this proposal.

GRF_invite_JAK_desc:0 "Jaki-Clan lies west of us, standing against the aggressors that surround them.

GRF_invite_YAK:0 "Invite Yakyakistan to the NRB"
GRF_invite_YAK_desc:0 "Yakyakistan lies west of our nation, bordering the changelings and the lands of ponies, they stand vulnerable to their aggressors. We should invite them to the Northern Bloc to start building a mutually beneficial relationship and protect their sovereignty.

GRF_support_allies:0 "Support for Our Allies"
GRF_support_allies_desc:0 "We have now established the Northern Bloc, a political union that should stand the test of time.

GRF_joint_courts_desc:0 "We need to look within before we reach out. The leading states in the Northern Bloc need to consolidate themselves and that their governments is running efficiently. This proposed joint court treaty will give new powers to member nations to aid in the continued functionality of their governments."
GRF_allied_military:0 "Combined Military Programmes"
GRF_allied_military_desc:0 "The Northern Bloc needs a proper military to begin defending the values of democracy and the rights of it's citizens. We should set up a military exchange between the nations, whilst not a jovial exchange of war-stories, this presents an opportunity to share military experience between nations. Exchange soldiers from each country will be able to allow each country to bolster their forces."
GRF_allied_movement:0 "Open Border Proposal"
GRF_allied_movement_desc:0 "The next sensible step for us to take as a modern democratic union, is to open up our borders to each other and allow our citizens to move freely between our nations. Each and every citizen should have the same rights in the country that they move to, provided they follow the laws of the country they are in."
GRF_tech_sharing:0 "NRB Technological Committee"
GRF_tech_sharing_desc:0 "The nations of the Northern Bloc stand to gain from a mutual putting together the greatest minds they have.

Not one nation will reap the rewards of technological breakthroughs, as they are a right to all people."
GRF_allied_research:0 "Collaborative Research Effort"
GRF_allied_research_desc:0 "Establishing the NRBTC was a massive success. However to further improve our nations, we must all put equal effort into these scientific pursuits.

GRF_allied_uni:0 "Open Weter University to Our Allies"
GRF_allied_uni_desc:0 "Following the introduction of new laws regarding the issue of science, application to Weter university has been opened to member states of the Northern Bloc. With smart people from around the NRB coming to apply at our prestigious university, we will most certainly see more breakthroughs originate from Weter University."
GRF_allied_industry:0 "Collaborative Industrial Effort"
GRF_allied_industry_desc:0 "The Northern Bloc lacks significant industrial development. Drafts of an international construction plan have been put forth and approved by the heads of all member states. Civilian sector industrial capacity will be increased across all countries involved with this effort."
GRF_allied_air_bases:0 "NRB Joint Air-force Initiative"
GRF_allied_air_bases_desc:0 "The Northern Bloc must look to the air. Whilst our union may be strong, our attention to the skies is wavering. Across the nations of the NRB, we find our capacity to send warplanes into the air lacking. We will institute news plans to construct airfields across the Bloc."
GRF_allied_oil:0 "Oil Trade Negotiations"
GRF_allied_oil_desc:0 "The Northern Bloc seeks to end one of its issues, the concern over oil demand and availability. Each nation shall construct a refinery to handle the processing of crude oil in their borders. With these built, we shall be able to build a larger army to defend our political union."
GRF_fortify_the_south:0 "The Severnyan Menace"
GRF_fortify_the_south_desc:0 "However much one can sympathize with the Stalliongraders' reason for revolting against Equestria, one cannot make the mistake of presuming them as gentle as their former masters. They are a threat to us, a serious one, and we have no excuse to not prepare for the worst."
GRF_the_volunteer_army:0 "Guardians Of The Free World"
GRF_the_volunteer_army_desc:0 "Due to our remote location from the central powers of the world, whatever threat that might come our way will have stepped over the ruins of many other sovereign nations first. In order to safeguard Nova Griffonia, we must understand and commit to the fact that liberty does not know borders, nor does freedom cease to be worth fighting for under a different flag."
GRF_stronghold_of_democracy:0 "Bastion Of Liberty"
GRF_stronghold_of_democracy_desc:0 "Nova Griffonia started out as a few colonists on the shores of a new and strange land, but she has grown into a great nation no longer beholden to the old world's order. She is free, she is just, and she is proud of this."
GRF_ties_with_the_republic:0 "Nurture The Republican Dream"
GRF_ties_with_the_republic_desc:0 "Do you see it in the distance? On those far-away shores a banner still flies, one that could have died in 979. The Republican Dream still lingers, rising from its slumber as it prepares to once again do battle with the emperors that one day may well demand our allegiance again. Their dream is ours, and we should make that clear to the world."
GRF_send_material_aid:0 "Material Aid"
GRF_send_material_aid_desc:0 "Words and praise are all well and good but they will not win the battle that is to come and Cloudbury is a poor substitute for the industrial might of the Herzland. That is why we shall make sure the Republican armies are properly geared for war. Equestria can settle for praise if they should choose so, Nova Griffonia deals in concrete material."
GRF_the_volunteer_corps:0 "The Nova Griffonian Volunteer Corps"
GRF_the_volunteer_corps_desc:0 "If the Republic is to survive, it will survive through the sacrifices of many brave griffons, and Nova Griffonia is not lacking in bravery. We shall not sit here comfortably on Equus while the Republicans face the wrath of the Empire head on, but instead we shall rally everygriff willing to fight for democracy, arm them and send them to Griffonia."
GRF_arsenal_of_democracy:0 "The Arsenal Of Democracy"
GRF_arsenal_of_democracy_desc:0 "We have no illusions of being equal to the Empire industrially, but by Boreas we shall try to be it all the same.

GRF_decry_the_empire:0 "Decry The Empire"
GRF_decry_the_empire_desc:0 "Our old overlord is a tyrant by its very nature, and for all the time that we were its subject we were not a province to be respected, but a place for resources and exploitation. Our course is already set for collision, and thus we may as well let the empire know that Nova Griffonia will never, never, never bow!"
GRF_guarantee_kemerskai:0 "The Republic's Cause is Ours"
GRF_guarantee_kemerskai_desc:0 "Liberty, Equality, Prosperity. These values are worth fighting for, indeed they are worth dying for.If the Empire chooses to beset the Republic, then Nova Griffonia and her allies will stand by democracy."
GRF_logistical_aid:0 "Logistics Support"
GRF_logistical_aid_desc:0 "With the kind of harsh conditions and rugged terrain that is all too common in our country we have been forced to sharpen our skills when it comes to logistics and reconnaissance. These skills are not inconsiderable at this point, and several volunteers among our rangers and scouts have all but pleaded with us to be allowed to go to Griffonia and share this knowledge with the republicans."
GRF_republican_loan:0 "Economic Aid"
GRF_republican_loan_desc:0 "The Griffonian Republicans may be heroes fighting for a good cause, but they are soldiers, not economists, and their economy is not where it could be. The sinews of war are made from infinite money, and Nova Griffonia has the know-how and resources to boost the Republican economy as well."
GRF_full_economic_support:0 "All In"
GRF_full_economic_support_desc:0 "Do we truly think that the empire will not want to reclaim its old vanity project on Equus? Do we think that the aid we already have given the republic will be ignored? Of course not, and therefore we cannot afford half-measures. The Republic's economy is Nova Griffonia's economy, and we can worry about the debt later!"

GRF_state_military:0 "The State of the Military"
GRF_state_military_desc:0 "We should commission a report on the state of our military. With the country moving into the new millennium our armed forces will face new challenges, and before we can tackle those, we will need a precise summary on our current situation."
GRF_state_army:0 "The Nova Griffonian Army"
GRF_state_army_desc:0 "Since our independence nearly thirty years ago, our army has been comprised mostly of local militias following elected leaders. While this has done wonders for morale, it is proving itself to be a bigger and bigger issue as our military operations grow in both complexity and size. No matter the solution, this issue must be fixed and it must be fixed soon."
GRF_automous_army:0 "Increase Militia Autonomy" 
GRF_automous_army_desc:0 "The militias have done a decent enough job so far, we may as well give their officers more autonomy. Who but the officers would know how to lead their griffons best?"
GRF_compromise_army:0 "The Art of Compromise" 
GRF_compromise_army_desc:0 "In the end we have decided to let the militias have a limited degree of autonomy. They shall retain the right to elect their officers. However, those officers must follow orders from high command, whether they like them or not."
GRF_organized_army:0 "Reform the Militias"
GRF_organized_army_desc:0 "It is time to rid ourselves of the quarrelsome militias. Our country will not suffer any insubordination in its army. Only a unified command structure following orders from the top down will be able to face the challenges of modern war."

GRF_grand_battleplan_f:0 "Trench Warfare"
GRF_grand_battleplan_f_desc:0 "Our doctrine will be modelled after the old art of besieging castles. We shall dig miles of deep trenches to protect our precious soldiers while they close in and slowly occupy more ground."
GRF_superior_firepower_f:0 "Creeping Barrage"
GRF_superior_firepower_f_desc:0 "Let's flood our enemies in an ocean of fire and steel! Shells from our cannons will blot out the sun!"
GRF_mobile_warfare_f:0 "Copy the Changelings"
GRF_mobile_warfare_f_desc:0 "The Changeling Army is probably the best fighting force on Equus, if not the entire world. Therefore, their revolutionizing doctrine of mobile warfare is the best choice for our military."
GRF_military_research_department:0 "Create the Military Research Department"
GRF_military_research_department_desc:0 "As a country located on Equus, we need to compete in terms of military research with countries miles ahead in technology compared to old Griffonia. We need military technology which can compete with the changelings and equestrians. This won't be an easy task, but with determination and endurance we shall prevail!"
GRF_radio_f:0 "Radio Implementation"
GRF_radio_f_desc:0 "The world rapidly changes around us. We have access to things we thought to be magic and witchcraft just a few decades ago. One of these things is the radio. This ground-breaking piece of technology can vastly improve communication all across the Army. We should implement it immediately."
GRF_rocket_artillery_f:0 "Adopt the Nebelwerfer"
GRF_rocket_artillery_f_desc:0 "Our old overlords from Griffenheim have developed a new rocket launcher - the "Nebelwerfer". They wanted to keep their project a total secret. However, during the final phase of development one of the scientists betrayed the Empire and escaped. And so it happens that there is one particular country which is always keen to give asylum to all imperial exiles... "
GRF_light_tank_f:0 "Import Changeling Panzers"
GRF_light_tank_f_desc:0 "Recently our government received an interesting proposal from the changeling government. They offer to sell some of their older panzer models for a surprisingly low price. These tanks will be an excellent base for future development of armoured vehicles. Send a telegraph to Vesalipolis at once!"
GRF_medium_tank_f:0 "Thicker Plating"
GRF_medium_tank_f_desc:0 "We managed to learn a lot from the field tests conducted on the panzers provided by the changelings. If implemented correctly, these metal monsters can wreak havoc on the battlefields. However, anti-tank guns are being developed in tandem with the tanks. If we are to keep an edge over enemy infantry, we need to produce tanks with thicker plates and bigger guns."
GRF_magical_rifles:0 "Our Own Magical Rifles"
GRF_magical_rifles_desc:0 "Equestrian scientists from the Luna Nova Academy recently come to a stunning discovery. It turns out that the magical energy from the purple crystals often found in the mountains can be used in weaponry! This is an opportunity we cannot miss. Nova Griffonia will produce its own magical rifles."
GRF_standard_rifles:0 "Standardise Rifle Models"
GRF_standard_rifles_desc:0 "After our separation from the Empire we were forced to import many differently designed rifle models from abroad. This caused logistical and production problems. In order to fix these issues we need analyse the current situation and choose one common rifle model for the entire army."
GRF_standard_artillery:0 "Implement The Cowitzer"
GRF_standard_artillery_desc:0 "A few years ago we managed to strike a great deal with Equestria. We acquired a modern artillery piece called "Cowtizer," we need to inspect it and create a new version suitable to our needs. May Eyr bless our shells!"
GRF_standard_support:0 "Support Squad Implementation"
GRF_standard_support_desc:0 "Recent military conflicts such as the Battle of Canterlot in 1002 showed us that in order to succeed, regular infantry needs to be supported by smaller units of soldiers trained for specific tasks. Intelligence reports say that other armies are already adding these companies to their divisions. Why shouldn't we?"
GRF_motorized_f:0 "Army Motorisation Effort"
GRF_motorized_f_desc:0 "Only a fool would deny the military potential of wheeled machines such as cars and trucks. We need to focus our efforts on motorizing the army to ensure its speed and modernity."
GRF_heavy_tank_f:0 "A Heavy Tank"
GRF_heavy_tank_f_desc:0 "As technology progresses it is becoming clear that we need a heavier tank variant to round out our arsenal of mobile weapons. With the thickest armour and the most devastating guns, these panzers will be able to break through any enemy strongpoint with ease. All we need is a design."
GRF_general_staff:0 "Reform the General Staff"
GRF_general_staff_desc:0 "The army's General Staff is comprised mostly of old veterans of the countless wars which plagued Griffonia in the 970s. Although the old guard's skill and experience cannot be questioned, we should allow younger officers to put their creative plans and strategies to the test. We cannot be stuck in the 10th century forever."
GRF_ranger_corps:0 "Create the Nova Griffonian Ranger Corps"
GRF_ranger_corps_desc:0 "Nova Griffonia is a vast country - forests and mountains often stretch for hundreds of kilometers. In order to patrol this wilderness more efficiently we should establish a new military force - The Nova Griffonian Ranger Corps. Claw-picked from the best units, the Rangers will specialise in reconnaissance, survival and combat in difficult terrain"
GRF_mountain_training:0 "Standing On the Back Of Giants"
GRF_mountain_training_desc:0 "Northern Nova Griffonia is almost entirely comprised of mountain ranges. Our army needs to excel at fighting in this type of terrain. This will require special high-altitude flying lessons, as well as specialised lightweight equipment for easy manoeuvres in a three-dimensional combat environment."
GRF_train_officers:0 "Standardised Officer Training"
GRF_train_officers_desc:0 "Ever since Nova Griffonia became independent the general skill and quality of our officer corps is all over the place. Although we are lucky to have some experienced exiles from Griffonia, most of the officers are young griffons from local militia units - with often little to no training at all. This is why we need to make efforts to put officer training standards on a higher level."
GRF_expand_corps:0 "Expand the Ranger Corps"
GRF_expand_corps_desc:0 "The introduction of the Ranger Corps turned out to be a giant success. The combat potential of our army has been greatly increased thanks to these brave griffons. We need to play to our strengths by expanding the corps."
GRF_reserveist_system:0 "Implement The Reservist System"
GRF_reserveist_system_desc:0 "As griffons we need to remember that we are surrounded by creatures of different races and cultures - they will never fully trust us. That's why we need to implement a special system of emergency military service in case of an external military threat."
GRF_armoury_system:0 "Standardised Armouries"
GRF_armoury_system_desc:0 "Our arms industry has fallen behind compared to those of larger Equus countries. We need to create more military factories designed to produce large amounts of modern equipment."
GRF_finish_reforms:0 "The Finest Army On Equus"
GRF_finish_reforms_desc:0 "Finally, after years of bold reforms we managed to create an effective and powerful military force. Glory to the Nova Griffonian Army, the Shield of Griffonkind on Equus!"

GRF_state_airforce:0 "The Nova Griffonian Air Force" 
GRF_state_airforce_desc:0 "The state of our current air corps is embarrassing to griffonkind. We must modernise our air force and reclaim the skies!"
GRF_strat_destruction:0 "Bomb Them To Tartarus"
GRF_strat_destruction_desc:0 "The only way to truly break an enemy is to break their will, break their morale and ruin their spirit. To hear the enemy planes bombing you to Tartarus as the soldiers rush at you, feeling the shrapnel go through your skull and break your bones. This is the warfare of the future."
GRF_air_superior:0 "Control The Skies"
GRF_air_superior_desc:0 "In combined arms warfare it is just as important to control the air as it is to control the ground, aerial support for the ground army paves the way for them to push into the enemy lines, while breaking enemy pushes with aerial bombardment and close air support. This is the warfare of the future."
GRF_operational_integrit:0 "Operational Integrity"
GRF_operational_integrit_desc:0 "Combining the griffon, the tank and the plane. We must train our troops and drill into them a cooperation between branches that they will never forget. To defeat our ever improving opponents we ourselves must improve and keep to the times, get ahead of the curve and defeat them. This is the warfare of the future."
GRF_expand_airbases:0 "A Nation of Airfields"
GRF_expand_airbases_desc:0 "We could have all the planes in the world, but with no runways to fly those from they are useless. The new airfields will stretch all across Nova Griffonia, from Weter to Federstadt, we will control the skies with all our might."
GRF_strat_bombers_focus:0 "Strategic Bombing"
GRF_strat_bombers_focus_desc:0 "We could easily waste thousands of bombs destroying every inch of our enemies, breaking their homes, workplaces and stores. But this is only a waste of potential. Bombing specific industrial sectors, fortifications and roads, combined with aerial support for our army will make the enemy buckle under our pressure."
GRF_tact_bombers_focus:0 "Develop Long Range Bombers"
GRF_tact_bombers_focus_desc:0 "To bomb our enemies we must reach them first, if we are to fight a large nation more powerful than us we must be able to use our planes. So to do this we shall make our finest scientists find new technology for long-range aerial bombardment."
GRF_jets:0 "Jet Experiments"
GRF_jets_desc:0 "Yet all know that in flight, speed is key. Reaching our enemies shores, bombarding their industries, shooting down their fighters. For this we will need new technology, which outpaces our enemies in leaps and bounds. Jet technology is strapping a rocket to a plane and hoping it doesn't explode. Can't be that complicated, can it?"
GRF_close_air_support_focus:0 "Aerial Ground Support"
GRF_close_air_support_focus_desc:0 "With close air support our troops will have all the help they need, their enemies mowed down by a fighter's turret, their artillery wracked by aerial barrages and the enemy's morale lowered as they hear the din of our engines, but not their own."
GRF_paratroopers:0 "The Skyhawks Elite"
GRF_paratroopers_desc:0 "We can invade our enemies through land, through the seas or now as the scientists tell us. Through the air! Giving our griffons parachutes and having them jump off of transport planes. Landing in enemy territory, taking their airfields and forts, striking them from behind before they even know what hit them."
GRF_fighter_focus:0 "Develop Fighter Craft"
GRF_fighter_focus_desc:0 "To control the air we must have fighters to hold it, the newest technology and the strongest of turrets. We must have wings of aluminium and pilots with hearts of steel. We will control the sky, there is no doubt."
GRF_heavy_fighter_focus:0 "Heavy Fighter Craft"
GRF_heavy_fighter_focus_desc:0 "While fighters are powerful things, they are light and soft. So, what better way to counter this than to make our own heavy fighters, turning our enemies' planes to dust and destroying their bombers?"
GRF_rule_the_skies:0 "The Kings of The Skies"
GRF_rule_the_skies_desc:0 "The griffon has been the king of the sky for as long as the world can remember and now we have reasserted our position as the kings of the sky. This time, however, with the help of technology. We have become a great aerial power that will find no match against our enemies. Truly, we have done a good job here."

GRF_state_navy:0 "The Nova Griffonian Navy"
GRF_state_navy_desc:0 "For too long our Navy has been getting the short end of the stick, and as such has been left in a dismal sate. We must improve our naval power!"
GRF_cat_base_strike_f:0 "Base-Strike Doctrine"
GRF_cat_base_strike_f_desc:0 "The Base-Strike Doctrine is simple, if we destroy our enemies' fleets while they are still at base they will be easily sunk to the bottom of the sea."
GRF_carrier_f:0 "Carrier Experiments"
GRF_carrier_f_desc:0 "The Aircraft Carrier has been a concept thrown around by our leading naval theorists for years. The idea of a ship designed for sea based airfields is tantalizing though expensive. But it is finally time to invest in this idea."
GRF_naval_aviation_f:0 "Naval Aviation Department"
GRF_naval_aviation_f_desc:0 "The naval bomber is a fine idea, a plane designed specifically for bombing our enemies' fleets into the depths of the sea, never to be found again."
GRF_cat_fleet_in_being_f:0 "Old School Tactics"
GRF_cat_fleet_in_being_f_desc:0 "The old naval doctrine has worked fine for us for many years, with its focus on large ships to project power. A fleet of the finest battleships, a massive fleet ready for battle at a moment's notice and able to tear a ship in half with one battery!"
GRF_mystic_dock:0 "Construct the Nouvelle Aquila Shipyards"
GRF_mystic_dock_desc:0 "We cannot have a proper navy if we do not have dockyards to build it, but this will be changed with the all new Nouvelle Aquila Shipyards. The perfect place for us to build a new fleet to rival all of our enemies with."
GRF_light_cruiser_f:0 "The Cruiser Squadrons"
GRF_light_cruiser_f_desc:0 "A squadron of cruisers to patrol our seas will be a useful thing indeed, with enough of them supporting our ships we will be able to defeat any enemy that tries to best us."
GRF_battlecruiser_f:0 "Battlecruiser Experiments"
GRF_battlecruiser_f_desc:0 "A cruiser is good, but a Battlecruiser, now that is a tempting type of ship that anyone would want! We have put our leading naval scientists upon the task of figuring out how to make them."
GRF_battleship_f:0 "The Battleship Plan"
GRF_battleship_f_desc:0 "But in the end, nothing beats a battleship. Large enough to destroy five enemies and not take a hit, batteries strong enough to pulverize all that oppose it. The battleship has always worked, and it will keep working."
GRF_cat_trade_interdiction_f:0 "Harassing The Supply Lines"
GRF_cat_trade_interdiction_f_desc:0 "Without being able to trade resources our enemies will be starved from the start of the war, unable to refuel their fleets or keep their factories running. This will mean we will easily win."
GRF_destroyer_f:0 "The Convoy Destruction Fleet"
GRF_destroyer_f_desc:0 "Cheap destroyers will make it easier for our nation to destroy our enemies' ships, from the Rocky seas to the Celestial Shores trade will be controlled by us!"
GRF_submarine_f:0 "The Hidden Fleet"
GRF_submarine_f_desc:0 "Yet under the water lies our secret weapon, a powerful new force in the naval war that is almost impossible to beat. The submarine, hidden away from the sight of our enemies and able to strike at a moment's notice. They won't notice until it's too late."
GRF_massive_expansion:0 "The Dockyard Expansion Scheme"
GRF_massive_expansion_desc:0 "With all these new developments and the constant buzz within our naval community it is time for us to get more dockyards to sate the navy's demands for ships. Truly this is a new age for the Nova Griffonian navy."

### Leader Descriptions ###
teabird_desc:0 "Scion of minor Imperial nobility far from home, Governor Teafeather made his reputation as a capable, charismatic leader of the Griffonian Colony. But for all his talent, he could not prevent the economic collapse caused by the Empire's downfall, and he keeps struggling to keep the nation together ever since. Fortunately for him, the public opinion is firmly on his side, and the extremist elements are marginalised. He yearns for the day the colony can stand for itself again, leaving him free to retire and return to his family in Brantbeak. With his newly developed economic plan, that day is set to come very soon."
always_depressed_desc:0 "Wilhelm Silverwing, once a popular militia commander, has swapped his military battlefield with a political one. He simply could not rest as he saw many destitute griffons lacking basic necessities such as shelter, food or even jobs. Thus, he and his party worked closely with Governor Teafeather to fund the welfare programs, with the little money they could secure in the nation's crashed economy. While not as popular as the Governor, Wilhelm earned the approval of the lower classes.\n\nFew grieved as much as he did on Teafeather's funeral, but it was no time to weep. Through his old contacts in the militia, he learned of the planned coup, and he could not allow this. Thus, Erwin Highhill's coup was nipped before it could truly spread, allowing for true democracy to choose the nation's next leader. With the extremist parties drawing little support, the griffons, who wished for prosperity to return, elected Silverwing with a large majority in the newly formed Republic of Nova Griffonia."
chadhill_desc:0 "Marshal Erwin Highhill has led a storied life before assuming complete control of the griffon colony. Once, he was a general in the Griffonian Empire's army, back in the day when it was still a unified, but quickly crumbling force. He quickly became infamous for routinely ignoring orders from the high command, always complaining that his strategic genius was being undermined. Erwin was too connected with the nobility to be forcibly relieved of his duty without a hassle. Instead, the high command offered Highhill the position of supreme military commander of the Griffonian Colony. Eager for glory, he accepted without pause.\n\nUnfortunately, he quickly realised that his "promotion" was but a derogatory reassignment, from which he couldn't turn back, and furthermore, as the Empire collapsed, things turned all the more sour. Stuck in a foreign land, he could do little more but annoy Governor Teafeather with demands for increased military budget, while instilling a sense of personal loyalty in his troops.\n\nSome say he had a claw in Teafeather's assassination. It matters not what anygriffon says now, for Marshal Highhill has finally achieved his dream - undisputed authority."
ultimate_griffon_desc:0 "Founder and CEO of the Talon Gunworks, Skeiron Goldfeather has always been notorious for his unhealthy obsession with wealth. It was his greed that led to his exile from the capitalist haven of Skyfall. While stories vary on what exactly was the reason, all can agree that he crossed a line, and the Iron Chancellor himself was involved in his swindling scheme. Taking what assets he could, he made his way to the crumbling colony, sensing a business opportunity in the wreckage - there were no major weapon manufacturers in the country, which ensued him a monopoly on firearm sales, as the other companies could not compete with his unscrupulous tactics.\n\nWar is profitable regardless of who is involved, and in the chaos after Teafeather's death, he made an even greater gain funding both sides in the civil war. With the strife coming to a close, he requested one final meeting with the victorious Marshall Highhill. It is anygriff's guess what occurred, but afterwards, Goldfeather found himself in charge of the war-torn nation. His rivals quietly left the country, their pockets full of Skeiron's blood money. He now leads the radically reorganised colony as one of his company's subdivisions - focused entirely on financial interest."
caesar_from_fnv_desc:0 "Reyhard Ironclaw, a colonial native, did not show interest in politics until he was given a series of books on the conquests of Grover the First. Being an avid reader, he was entranced by the books' historical content - the strength of griffons, a vast united country, a single undisputed ruler. It became clear to him that the colony's dilapidated state was the result of it lacking all these qualities. With that, he founded his reliable Falcons and has spent a great amount of time trying to convince the populace of his vision. Unfortunately, his ideas were in a minority as most griffons simply saw no need for such a drastic change of leadership, nor did they agree with his demeaning comments on ponykind.\n\nClearly, he benefited from Teafeather's demise. With the nation shattered in a brutal civil war, he opportunistically allied himself with Marshal Highhill's coup, then disposed of him once the marshal was past his usage. Ironclaw always regarded Highhill as an uninspired stooge, lacking his grand vision, one that is now set to become a reality in the reformed colony."
snooty_commie_bird_desc:0 "A well read intellectual from Federstadt, Heinrich Redtail was visiting the Equestrian region of Severyana when the uprising occurred. Due to an eventful venture, he became a friend of Steel Stallion, who he spent many nights with, discussing the merits of Markism. Being rather physically weak, he did not directly participate in the Severyan Revolution, but he helped codify some of the Revolution's tenets. He returned to his hometown afterwards, hoping to rally the impoverished proletariat into action, yet his coup did not get off the ground as he, together with his conspirators, were quickly arrested. After being released from prison, he decided to start a peaceful political party, gaining moderate popularity, yet never truly being able to challenge the colonial administration.\n\nThis changed following the events of Teafeather's death, as Redtail's party was successful in securing enough votes to claim victory in the election. With a fertile ground for the spread of socialism, he now seeks to remake Nova Griffonia in the image of his distant friend, where the workers will finally be free of exploitation."
chernobyl_beak:0 "§YBorn§!: 15th of April, 979 in Winghagen\n\n§YRank§!: Oberst\n\n§YBiography§!: Daniel Crimsonbeak was born to a Gryphussian Republican Officer and a middle class Cloudburian citizen. Being the only child, Daniel had a very happy childhood. Just like his father, he decided to apply to the officer academy and managed to graduate.\n\nIt was at this time where his political beliefs started to take shape. He considered himself a social democrat and never fully trusted President Kemerskai, arguing that the Marshal can be very easily corrupted by the power he held. Daniel never shared his beliefs with anyone. That is until one infamous day.\n\nDuring an officer party he got extremely drunk and started to insult Kemerskai, saying that the President was incompetent and that it was his stupidity which caused the 978 Revolution to fail. The morning after this unfortunate incident Daniel realised how tragic his situation was. He managed to catch a ship to Nova Griffonia and escape from certain court martial. Luckily for for him, the former colony was a safe haven for exiles. Thanks to his officer experience he got accepted into the Nova Griffonian military as a Militia Commander. He is a stout supporter of Wilhelm Silverwing and his Griffonian Social Democratic Party. He was part of the Nova Griffonian delegation during the Equestria Games of 1003 ALB.During his stay in Equestria he discussed with equestrian officers about the implementation of motorized vechicles in modern warfare.\n\nDaniel sternly considers himself Gryphussian despite being raised in Northern Griffonia. He believes that all creatures of the world are created equal – no matter the race. In his opinion Griffonia should be united once again under a democratic federation of nations, arguing that a centralized state is too vulnerable to corruption and injustice.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Scroup"
GRF_paddy_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 983 in Las Pegasus\n\n§YRank§!:Mercenary-General\n\n§YBiography§!: Born in Las Pegasus in 983, Paddy Rockfeller is the daughter of oil magnate Rockfeller. While the circumstances of her birth have been clouded by Rockfeller's own efforts, we have extrapolated that she is indeed his biological daughter from medical records taken from Celestia's Sun Hospital in Las Pegasus.\n\nIn 1006 she made her eighteenth attempt at running away following an arranged marriage with [REDACTED] of HorseCo. She managed to flee North to Nova Griffonia and escaped to an island under Stalliongrad's control known as "Azkaban." She was subsequently offered for ransom by "rogue" elements of the Communist Party there.\n\nThe bounty hunter Jean De Basse, on contract from General Petroleum, performed a successful rescue mission but has refused to return her to the company. The two have been inseparable and returned to fight for their freedom as mercenaries for Nova Griffonia."
GRF_jean_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 976 in Aquila\n\n§YRank§!:Mercenary-General\n\n§YBiography§!:Jean is the bastard son of revolutionary Jarvet De Basse, brother to Stella De Basse of Vedina, and heir to the family's armor. Jarvet was killed fighting against the 985 Reign of Terror in Aquileia, forcing Jean to flee to Skyfall with his mother as a child.\n\nWhat happened in his youth cannot be determined without asking the griffon himself. All that is known for sure is the young De Basse accrued a large debt while working for the various oligarchs in Skyfall as hired muscle with his inheritance: his father's armor.\n\nEventually, the oligarchs decided to collect on their debt. A contract opened on Jean in 1001 and he fled once more to Nova Griffonia. Late in 1006, Jean De Basse was forced into a contract to capture Paddy Rockfeller. A shocking series of escapades, skirmishes, and adventure led to Jean breaching his contract and fleeing with Paddy to Nova Griffonia to fight for their freedom...all for highest bidder, of course."

 griffons.1.d:0 "Chaos consumed the nation, as today on a warm summer day Teafeather the long standing Governor of our fair nation was shot dead upon the steps of his manor. Unfortunately the assailant managed to escape before the police could respond, and without a scape-goat to blame the people turned on each other. The long standing tensions between the Communists, the Harmonists and the Fascists exploded and the streets ran red with the griffon blood.

As Nova Griffonia begins its first grand elections, three parties have coalesced to contend for leadership.\n\nThe first is the Liberal Front, who seeks to largely continue the Teafeather administration's policies to ensure a free market and a stable society. Nova Griffonia is built on commerce, they say, and should continue so.\n\nSecondly is the Nova Griffonian Social Democratic Party, whose party leader worked closely with the old governor and who wishes to rebuild Nova Griffonia into a welfare state with a more restricted approach to market economics.\n\nThe last contender is the Federation of Nova Griffonian Socialist Parties, who despite their radical ideas have sworn respect the democratic process and to abide by the election results. They are seeking to remake Nova Griffonia - democratically - into a socialist state.\n\nThe ballots have been counted and the nation awaits the result with bated breath."

An empire that once spanned continents, an empire that once had millions upon millions of people living under it's glorious banner, but now it is dead, an empire now reduced to rubble.

 griffons.14.d:0 "Following his recent coup d'etat, Highhill, newly appointed Leader of Nova Griffonia, has now ordered for him to be officially crowned Emperor of the Griffons. The coronation took place inside the Grand Barracks of the capital, followed up by a speech from Highhill to his subjects and a mighty military parade. "The days of chaos and instability are over," Highhill spoke to his people. "Our nation shall be one of unison, strength and determination. It is time for us to rise up and reclaim our rightful spot on the world stage! It is time to reclaim the honour and glory of the empire!" The speech was followed up by mighty choirs of cheering griffons down in the streets of the capital. Although he seems hot-headed and determined, it is still to see whether he is really to come back on his promises and goals. The world is holding its breath for the time being."

Unsurprisingly, he and his followers would not be satisfied with the election result itself, and it was today announced that the griffons had crowned Ironclaw himself as their newest emperor. The coronation took place in an old plaza of the capital. Many hundreds of griffons arrived to see the spectacle. A marching band of over 2000 soldiers commenced the ceremony, followed up by a speech from Ironclaw himself after which he then crowned himself emperor. "Today is our day," Ironclaw said in his speech. "Today is the day we rid ourselves from the corrupt, degenerate and weak democracy that has been plaguing our beautiful country. Today we look forward eagerly. A new, bright future awaits us! Our destiny awaits us!" The griffons' neighbours have visibly been growing nervous over these recent developments, and the world as a whole will have to look out for a stronger, united griffon folk. We shall watch how this situation develops."

 griffons.16.d:0 "Following his recent coup d'etat, Highhill, newly appointed Leader of the Nova Griffonia, has now ordered for him to be officially crowned Emperor of the Griffons. The coronation took place inside the Grand Barracks of the capital, followed up by a speech of Highhill to his subjects and a mighty military parade. "The days of chaos and instability are over," Highhill spoke to his people. "Our nation shall be one of unison, strength and determination. It is time for us to rise up and reclaim our rightful spot on the world stage! It is time to reclaim the honour and glory of the empire!" The speech was followed up by mighty choirs of cheering griffons down in the streets of the capital. Although he seems hot-headed and determined, it is still to see whether he is really to come back on his promises and goals. The world is holding its breath for the time being."
 griffons.16.a:0 "What a loon..."
 griffons.17.t:0 "The New Imperator"
 griffons.17.d:0 "As a result of the recent election, fascist party leader Ironclaw was made leader of the griffons. Unsurprisingly, he and his followers would not be satisfied with the election result itself, and it was today announced that the griffons had crowned Ironclaw himself as their newest emperor. The coronation took place in an old plaza of the capital. Many hundreds of griffons arrived to see the spectacle. A marching band of over 2000 soldiers commenced the ceremony, followed up by a speech from Ironclaw himself after which he then crowned himself emperor. "Today is our day," Ironclaw said in his speech. "Today is the day we rid ourselves from the corrupt, degenerate and weak democracy that has been plaguing our beautiful country. Today we look forward eagerly. A new, bright future awaits us! Our destiny awaits us!" The griffons' neighbours have visibly been growing nervous over these recent developments, and the world as a whole will have to look out for a stronger, united griffon folk. We shall watch how this situation develops."
 griffons.17.a:0 "What a loon."

 griffons.21.t:0 "Highhill's Criticism"
 griffons.21.d:0 "Field Marshal Highhill the former military governor of Nova Griffonia and close friend of the now deceased Governor has taken to criticising the Provisional Government for their mediocre attempts at restoring order to the country, and letting radicals run wild through the streets unchecked. While not as beloved as Teafeather Highhill still has the respect and more importantly the ears of most of our military, and his criticism won't do us any favours."
 griffons.21.a:0 "As if he could do any better..."
 griffons.22.t:0 "FfIfG Soup Kitchens"
 griffons.22.d:0 "There has been some surprising news from the poorer districts of Weter today. Several members of the FfIfG and even the infamous Falcons of Griffonstone have taken it upon themselves to open several soup kitchens in an effort to feed the poor. Why they've done this can only be speculated upon, but to most it is welcome to see that even in these dark times some basic kindness can still be found in the most unexpected places."
 griffons.22.a:0 "What's next, magic Mules?"
 griffons.23.t:0 "Clashes in the Streets"
 griffons.23.d:0 "Despite the FfIfG and the PGG agreeing to cease any and all violence between each other some of their more zealous members seemingly haven't gotten the memo. As today in the middle of Weter no less, the two sides clashed causing several dozen deaths, injuring hundreds and causing hundreds of thousands of bits in damage. Needless to say this little debacle hasn't done their representatives in the Provisional Government any favours."
 griffons.23.a:0 "It's like herding cats..."
 griffons.24.t:0 "NGDF Scandal"
 griffons.24.d:0 "An interesting scandal has come up in the Provisional Government today, as it was discovered the NGDF representative has had no less than 27 affairs with creatures ranging from Bat Ponies to Dragons... needless to say the NGDF representatives were left speechless. Perhaps that is because of the sheer insanity of it all, or their fellow representative's interesting choice of lovers."
 griffons.24.a:0 "He certainly doesn't like vanilla..."
 griffons.25.t:0 "Workers Strike"
 griffons.25.d:0 "Several trade unions have utilised the chaos in the country to protest what they call "abhorrent working conditions" in our factories. Apparently they've deluded themselves into thinking that child labour is something that should be abolished, and while their message was rather nice and all we doubt anyone could have heard them over the burning buildings and gunshots ringing out through the entire country."

 griffons.26.t:0 "The Death of Nova Griffonian Democracy"
 griffons.26.d:0 "Not long ago Governor Teafeather was assassinated and a Provisional Government was formed in Weter until the country could stabilise. The goal of the government was to eventually give way to a democratic election; however it seems that such an election shall not be happening any time soon. As a day ago Field Marshal Highhill marched upon the governmental palace at the front of a column of soldiers and proceeded to dissolve the Provisional Government. Griffonia's future now rests in Highhill's claws."

 griffons.28.t:0 "Demands for Peace"
 griffons.28.d:0 "After months of making practically no progress in ridding the Frontier of Virgil and his bandits the support for our war has hit an all-time low. Many of our populace are demanding we withdraw and stop wasting griffon lives on a useless piece of land."
 griffons.28.a:0 "We've got no other option..."
 griffons.28.b:0 "Faithless cowards! We'll win this war or die trying!"
 griffons.281.t:0 "The Frontier Accepts Truce"
 griffons.281.d:0 "In a somewhat surprising move, the thugs leading the Frontier have decided to agree on an armistice, although there's little doubt it is a temporary one. Governor Teafeather has assured the concerned griffons that Virgil and his band will be dealt with, eventually. For now we must focus on rebuilding ourselves."
 griffons.281.a:0 "Your time will come, Virgil."
 griffons.282.t:0 "The Frontier Declines Truce"
 griffons.282.d:0 "Regrettably, the bandits and other miscreants of the Frontier have laughed off our offer of peace! Thankfully the envoy was left unharmed, but now we must fight to the bitter end against these vicious raiders... Public support for this war is already very low, so we must finish this up before our people rise up against us, or even worse, join these rebels. The general staff has drawn up plans for a new plan of attack."
 griffons.282.a:0 "I'll see your head on a pike, Virgil!"
 griffons.29.t:0 "The Frontier"
 griffons.29.d:0 "It seems that Heinrich has somehow managed to take over the Frontier. However with his original intention of bringing the revolution to Nova Griffonia becoming somewhat redundant he's decided that he wishes to re-join our nation once more."
 griffons.29.a:0 "Welcome back brother!"
 griffons.30.t:0 "Skeiron's Scheming"
 griffons.30.d:0 "Unsurprisingly to anyone whom knows him, Skeiron used his new-found power as our economic minister to seize some foreign factories, which he quickly incorporated into Talon Gunworks. While this doesn't hurt us per se; on the contrary it's rather useful, it is still a very blatant abuse of power and reflects poorly on our government."
 griffons.30.a:0 "At least warn us next time, Goldfeather."
 griffons.31.t:0 "Griffonian Migrants"
 griffons.31.d:0 "Yet another batch arrived today, fleeing Griffonia with naught but their clothes on their backs. They hope to find a better future here far from the wars of the Old Empire, and we welcome them with open wings."
 griffons.31.a:0 "Welcome to Nova Griffonia!"
 griffons.32.t:0 "Supporting Loyalists in the Equestrian Civil War"
 griffons.32.d:0 "We've received horrible news from Equestria. It seems that Princess Luna has yet again turned into Nightmare Moon. How the Equestrians didn't see this happening is anyone's guess, but most of our citizens and more importantly our advisors seem to be of the belief that should Nightmare Moon win the Civil War she will eventually set her sights on us. What shall we do?"
 griffons.32.a:0 "Send the Equestrians some guns and call it a day."
 griffons.32.b:0 "Arm some volunteers and send them to Equestria."
 griffons.32.c:0 "This really does not concern us."
 griffons.33.t:0 "Griffon Volunteers Arrive"
 griffons.33.d:0 "It seems that the griffons perhaps realising the threat that Nightmare Moon poses to the entire world have sent some volunteers to help us fight her forces."
 griffons.33.a:0 "At least it's something."
 griffons.34.t:0 "Supporting Equestria against the Changelings"
 griffons.34.d:0 "It seems that the Changelings have decided to invade Equestria, and while we don't exactly like either side, it's better to have the Equestrians at our doorstep than the Changelings. Therefore, some of our advisors have recommended that we send some assistance to the Equestrians."
 griffons.34.a:0 "Send them some equipment I'm sure they'll appreciate it."
 griffons.34.b:0 "Arm a couple of volunteer regiments and ship them off."
 griffons.34.c:0 "We've got better things to do."

 griffons.50.t:0 "The Long March"
 griffons.50.d:0 "All the way from Weter, our troops marched onwards towards the northwest. As our forces reached the hills, communist guerrillas began skirmishing the exhausted troops, but all was not lost. Highhill rallied the soldiers and lead them on a counterattack which broke the spirit of the terrorists in no time. Soon enough the hills and mountains were cleansed of communist scum. Victory is ours, at least this day."
 griffons.50.a:0 "It's a long way to the Kingsmere..."
 griffons.51.t:0 "The Skirmish at Guidonuovo"
 griffons.51.d:0 "The communist-controlled town of Guidonuovo was an important center of rebellion. Here the red flag was raised first, as soon as news of the coup arrived, and the local garrison expelled after a fierce battle. It had since become a fortified bastion of socialism which would not fall easily. Highhill knew he had to be cunning to avoid a costly siege.\n\nOur troops marched through local forests during the night, hiding their advance until revealing themselves just outside the city. It was not a pleasant experience for anyone involved and a group of soldiers were even ambushed by an Ursa Major. However, it was all worth it as they emerged out of the forest at dawn, arriving from a direction which had been left completely undefended. The reds had no time to prepare and organise a response and the city was quickly taken by our brave soldiers. Once more, we have defeated these vile traitors!"
 griffons.51.a:0 "Send the prisoners to the camps!"
 griffons.52.t:0 "The Pacification of Kluv Valley"
 griffons.52.d:0 "After the coup, communist partisans joined forces with local yak insurgents in Kluv Valley, promising to recognize them as equal citizens of Nova Griffonia if they aided them. The local yak populace has long been a thorn on our side and this only proves that thorn should've been removed before it was too late.\n\nHighhill's forces first occupied the hills and mountains surrounding the valley which the rebels had foolishly left undefended. Then he brought in his artillery to rain fires of Tartarus upon the unprepared enemy. With fierce fire support, the infantry easily shattered pockets of resistance and took thousands of prisoners. Yaks, however, proved to be resilient fighters who stubbornly refused to surrender. After heavy casualties they were finally driven across the border into Jakistan."
 griffons.52.a:0 "We've got those bastards on the run!"
 griffons.53.t:0 "The Battle at the Kingsmere"
 griffons.53.d:0 "A clash between two gigantic forces, ours and that of the communists, took place on the shores of the Kingsmere lake to our northwest.\n\nWhat was initially a skirmish developed into an all-out battle, with artillery and airplanes. Griffons, both loyalist and communist, perished on the battlefield by the hundreds. Although the casualties were high, the reds were the ones to sound the retreat at the end of the day. Our fighters mowed them down without mercy as they tried to escape by running and flying."
 griffons.53.a:0 "The Kingsmere is ours!"
 griffons.54.t:0 "Up the Beak Mountains"
 griffons.54.d:0 "By using old, largely forgotten mountain paths, a small detachment of troops managed to sneak past several republican patrols. They managed to make their way into the camp of the rebels, which were defended by a small force. A shootout quickly turned into a lengthy skirmish with traior guerrillas as enemy reinforcements arrived. The mountainous terrain did not favour our troops in any way, but through sheer willpower, valiant effort and Highhill's leadership, our troops pushed ever onwards and eventually captured the camp and its supplies, which caused the rebels who were left to surrender."
 griffons.54.a:0 "It was a tough battle..."
 griffons.55.t:0 "The Battle for the North"
 griffons.55.d:0 "Our troops marched north, aiming to reclaim the frigid fjords and mountains from the traitors. It did not take long for them to engage in a series of small battles with the local resistance. The rebels pulled back before ambushing our troops once more, then pulling back again. This would repeat at least five times before the enemy finally dispersed for good, but the casualties are truly something to be mourned."
 griffons.55.a:0 "What a pain."
 griffons.56.t:0 "The Battle of Ny Winghagen"
 griffons.56.d:0 "The coastal city of Ny Winghagen, an old settlement that had always had republican sentiment, had been taken by rebel troops after Highhill's coup. They had celebrated Kemerskai's "liberation" of their old homeland decades ago and continued to advocate the establishment of a Nova Griffonian republic.\n\nThat nonsense ended today when our troops tore down the republican tricolour from the flagpole at the center of Ny Winghagen. The fighting had been some of the fiercest yet, but, after taking many casualties during the urban fighting in the city, the troops managed to secure each building. The democratic rebels who remained alive were scattered into a retreat.\n\nWhile this is a great victory, it foreshadows the fighting soon to occur in the city of Nouvelle Aquila, not far from Ny Winghagen."
 griffons.56.a:0 "We're almost there..."
 griffons.57.t:0 "The Battle for Nouvelle Aquila"
 griffons.57.d:0 "It was a bloodbath, indeed.\n\nThe republican defences in and around Nouvelle Aquila were a deadly obstacle. The city itself was the capital of the NGDF, who saw it as the Nova Griffonian beacon of democracy. After the counter-revolution in Aquileia many years ago, the King had exiled thousands of republicans here, and they had not abandoned their pathetic ideology since. Many of them saw the current unrest as an opportunity to redeem themselves by overthrowing the government and establishing a republic, like they had done in 980.\n\nArtillery howled in the deep of the night, shelling enemy foxholes and barricades in the suburbs. Then, shortly after, the first assault battalions engaged. Machine guns sang and rifles barked. The occasional muzzle flash from the enemy's guns was all the soldiers could aim for during those late hours. And although the casualties were greater than expected, our troops overran the outer defences.\n\nLater, at sunrise, a renewed barrage of high-explosive shells bombarded the city itself. Windows shattered, roofs caved in, fires took hold of a quarter of the city. The rebel troops, discouraged by this, held on by a thread. By the time our troops engaged them in close-quarters combat, even melee combat in some cases. Though their resistance was fierce, they were soon made to surrender.\n\nThe day is ours, and the voice of democracy has been silenced for good."
 griffons.57.a:0 "A costly victory."
 griffons.58.t:0 "The End of the Civil War"
 griffons.58.d:0 "After many months, and plenty of skirmishes and battles, we have come out on top and defeated those who wished to depose our rightful government. We have restored order and justice in Nova Griffonia, and it is now time to march onwards! A new government will be formed under the watchful eye of Erwin Highhill, the hero of the conflict. He will ensure it will be a strong and united one, free from deviant and destabilising communism and democracy. However, Reyhard Ironclaw proved himself to be a charismatic and fierce leader during the fighting, gaining popular support in the process and swelling the ranks of his party. None can also deny that Skeiron Goldfeather's industries fueled the war effort and enabled us to gain victory. Now there are whispers that Ironclaw is planning to seize power and Skeiron seeks to bribe Highhill and become the leader of a truly free Nova Griffonia. Whatever the case, a new government must be organized soon, lest Nova Griffonia falls into chaos again."
 griffons.58.a:0 "Let none question our rule!"
 griffons.59.t:0 "The Falcons Dispersed"
 griffons.59.d:0 "The FfIfG, or Party of Griffon Interests, is a relatively well-known radical movement, which aims to further only griffon interests while abandoning other species entirely, and leaving behind the weak-minded and weak-bodied.\n\nAdditionally, this party has long had a unofficial paramilitary wing: The Falcons of Griffonstone. Though they are in the service of the party, many see them as nothing but thugs, thiefs and simple criminals. We must make it clear that we do not allow these types of movements in our nation, anymore. Their organisation must be banned at once, and the members prosecuted accordingly."
 griffons.59.a:0 "I never liked those bastards anyway."
 griffons.60.t:0 "The Wildcard"
 griffons.60.d:0 "The Civil war has ended, but the nation is still undecided on what to do now. Erwin Highhill appears as the obvious answer, having lead us through the civil war, though also having caused the civil war in the first place. Reyhard Ironclaw of the FfIfG is also very keen on seizing power himself, in order to establish a totalitarian state.\n\nSkeiron Goldfeather, the richest Griffon in Nova Griffonia and the leading economic advisor, can only laugh at these two. He knows that true power doesn't come from controlling the citizens of the state, and enforcing ridiculous laws and regulations, but rather the opposite. Goldfeather knows that money is the only thing that can make any Griffon happy, and that with enough money in one's pockets, you could achieve just about anything.\n\nAfter a few backdoor talks, and a very, very generous donation, Highhill has dissolved the military junta, and has declared Skeiron Goldfeather as the new head of state. The nation now awaits what Goldfeather, a rather unknown dark figure to many, has planned."
 griffons.60.a:0 "We're open for business!"
 griffons.61.t:0 "The March of the Falcons"
 griffons.61.d:0 "Today was the day. When the Civil War ended, Reyhard Ironclaw and all party members of the FfIfG knew that this was their only shot at seizing power, when Highhill was weakest.\n\nThe Falcons of Griffonstone, the infamous militant wing of the FfIfG, gathered outside Weter today, and with Ironclaw leading them, they marched onwards. The City's inhabitants were stunned. The local police could do nothing against this march with their few numbers, and many officers fled the city in fear.\n\nIn the end, Ironclaw and his lackies seized power and arrested Highhill. A new Order shall rise, under a new leadership."

The diplomats speak of offering our nation the chance to join the Northern Bloc, a democratic union which promotes the basic rights of every individual. They mention a wide variety of plans, plans such as collaborative technological pursuits, an industrial development initiative, and several military drills that can be planned and implemented in the future.\n\nDo we accept, or do we decline?

 griffons.74.t:0 "The Dinner" #Void
 griffons.74.d:0 "Blackpeak's home in Weter sat looking outwards over the city. Rich furnishings draped the walls, picturing scenes from Griffonian history. And yet, one of the guests were quite not like the ones usually received by the new Governor. Indeed, Blackpeak's guest wasn't dressed in any ornate clothes, or even something that didn't have any patches. The Red Eagle, Redtail had come for dinner. \n\n"I might prefer the simple diet of a worker, but even I can enjoy a good meal and a good glass of wine," Redtail said as he sipped a glass of Marelandian red wine. \n\nBlackpeak himself sipped another glass of wine, looking to Redtail "I am happy that it falls in your taste. Now, I wanted to talk to you about the new ideas we have for the country." \n\nRedtail glared at Blackpeak. "Yes, I've heard of it. I hope you're not planning that extensive a societal wrecking." \n\n"We do a bit on the side. But we are open to compromise, should the opportunity arise," Blackpeak mused as he chewed on a piece of steak. \n\nRedtail studied Blackpeak's facial expressions "Hm?" \n\n"We want to compromise. I'm not some sort of dogmatic idiot," Blackpeak muttered as he indulged in another glass of wine. \n\n"Aha. And your big manifesto?" Redtail deadpanned. \n\n"Flexible," Blackpeak said.\n\nRedtail stared for a second on Blackpeak "I'm sure we can agree on something. But first, let us eat.""

 griffons.75.t:0 "Cutting The Red Tape"
 griffons.75.d:0 "Many times, Nova Griffonia's bureaucracy grew up organically. New challenges arose for the colony, and the administration solved the issues where they arose. It is an understandable method to approach things, but it has left the bureaucracy of the nation bloated in several areas. After a thorough review, the issues found includes but are not limited to\n\n-A department for the establishment of a proper Nova Griffonian presence around the Kingsmere (achieved twenty years ago and leaving a pack of bureaucrats twiddling their claws and earning paychecks)\n-Six different forms for requesting monetary aid for infrastructure projects(Including one which was grandfathered in from the Empire pre-colonization)\n-Two separate auditing departments(neither of which had the mandates needed to effectively carry out its duties)\n-Four offices found in a downward spiral of requesting forms from each other(Forms which requested other forms, which in return would request the original form from the correspondent)\n\nIt was known that the bureaucracy needed to be cleaned up, but few expected it was quite this bad. Nevertheless, the process of cutting down on these superfluous departments and offices has proceeded with good speed, and the apparatus of state is already starting to flow more smoothly than before."
 griffons.75.a:0 "Bloody finally!"
 
 griffons.76.t:0 "Our New Friends"  
 griffons.76.d:0 "In a public event, the council of Nova Griffonia, along with representatives from the "Landorganizatsye", the umbrella organization for the Nova Griffonian labor unions, has officially signed into effect the "Zaltsimvane agreement", under which the government has outlawed strikebreakers, lockouts and guaranteed sweeping labor rights for all workers in Nova Griffonia, no matter where.\n\nIn return, the Landorganizatsye have agreed to forbid its members from going on strikes unless negotiations have been carried out, as well as formalize the process of salary negotiation and collective bergaining.\n\nThe Council's laws could have paralyzed the employers' ability to handle striking without capitulating, and the Landorganizatsye's promises in many areas neutered them. Yet, put these two things together and the framework has been laid for labor relations ruled not by antagonism, but by concord."
 griffons.76.a:0 "May this spirit be with us all from now on."
 
 griffons.77.t:0 "Interparty Cooperation" 
 griffons.77.d:0 "The NGSDF and FfNGSP have much in common, not the least their appreciation for the democratic process, but they also are different in many areas. Not the least the NGSDF's quiet endorsement of the capitalist system has been a source of friction between the two parties, and conversely, many in the NGSDF view the FfNGSP as too radical.\n\nYet, the time comes where one must put on the adult hat and work for the betterment of all. For the last few days, the parties have been in intense negotiations to find a path forward that can be satisfactory for both sides, where the FfNGSP can count on aid in the council from the NGSDF.\n\nThe details are numerous and the minutiae doubly so, but after nearly two weeks, the two parties have announced that they have reached a mutually satisfactory arrangement. From now on, the communists can count on the aid of the Social Democrats in order to execute their policies."
 griffons.77.a:0 "Splendid!"
 
 griffons.78.t:0 "The Referendum Act"  
 griffons.78.d:0 "In order to move democracy closer to the people and avoid any risk of turning Nova Griffonia into an autocracy, a grand project has begun to implement public referendums to help guide the nation alongside the council. It will be ambitious, but the foundation of the nation's power is its people and thus the will should be well and truly represented even in the day to day affairs of policy and lawmaking, not just in the few months before the elections.\n\nImplementing this system on a nation as vast and sometimes empty as Nova Griffonia will be a challenge, but it is a challenge that spurs us to action. Distant villages will receive telephone lines and so that they can more easily be informed of the referendums and to inform of their results, the larger towns will build assembly halls so that the people have somewhere to gather, and our system for counting ballots will be updated. It will be a lot of work, but it is an exciting challenge, and the people are cheering for the right that is now given back to them."    
 griffons.78.a:0 "Of course, we could turn into a second Griefenmarschen..."
 
 griffons.79.t:0 "Our Friends From Across The Sea"
 griffons.79.d:0 "Sometimes, the blessings in life come from the most unexpected places. Nova Griffonia, that old colony across the sea, have weathered the storm of the recent years better than one might have expected. A democratically elected government sits at its helm, and their ambassador in Cloudbury has contacted us to let us know that Nova Griffonia counts the Republic as a friend, and that this friendship will not stop at kind words."
 griffons.79.a:0 "Wonderful!"
 
 griffons.80.t:0 "The Nova Griffonian Gift"
 griffons.80.d:0 "Cargo ships have been arriving for the last week in Winghagen, loaded to the brim with rifles, machine guns, cannons and supplies. The dockworkers report that they are struggling to deal with the size of the shipment, and the Nova Griffonian diplomat has, somewhat smugly, told the government that he did tell us that Nova Griffonia was not going to stop at fine words."
 griffons.80.a:0 "He did indeed!"
 
 griffons.81.t:0 "The Volunteer Regiments"
 griffons.81.d:0 "Following their shipment of weapons, Nova Griffonia have raised, equipped and trained several divisions of soldiers for the Republican cause. These frontiersgriffs are a rough and tumble lot, but after only a few days it is clear that they are well-trained and dedicated, and with the struggles that await us they are more than welcome not only for the place they can take on the front-line, but as a show of how griffons across the world support the Republican ideals."
 griffons.81.a:0 "Now if only their ambassador could stop preening..."
 
 griffons.82.t:0 "The Nova Griffonian Logistics Corps"
 griffons.82.d:0 "Nova Griffonia have sent over a corps of advisors and logistics staff to help shoring up our supply- and reconnaissance networks. Their experience in the vast expanses of Northern Equus has quickly proven itself more than helpful, and though their numbers are relatively small, the impact they are making is noticeable throughout our armed forces."
 griffons.82.a:0 "Great!"
 
 griffons.83.t:0 "Aid From Our Friends"
 griffons.83.d:0 "The government of Nova Griffonia has presented a plan to us under which they would provide us with economic aid and support for certain key industries. The ambassador had forewarned the parliament of some of the details, but seeing the offer on paper has still been a shock to some of the more cynical members of parliament."
 griffons.83.a:0 "Magnificent!"
 
 griffons.84.t:0 "Nova Griffonia Goes All In"
 griffons.84.d:0 "In news equally surprising as delightful, Nova Griffonia has increased the economic support it provides to us substantially. Our economists are giggling like schoolgriffs at the moment, overjoyed by the support and raving about how generous the terms given"

 griffons.45.d:0 "In a great achievement for our colony our troops have forced out the Equestrians stationed in the State Up North. While the fleeing Equestrian transport ships sailed over the horizon our troops moved into the Village Up North, the townsfolk looking on in fear as the engines of the Nova Griffonian war machine rolled past. To alleviate their concerns many pony troops were given leave to talk up how much better life is under our flag than that of the warring Equestrians, and by the end of the day at least some of the populace have decided to give our government a shot. It is unknown how the proposed plan to rename the city will affect this, but at the moment it is still only a proposal."
 griffons.45.a:0 "They will all soon be fully [Root.GetAdjective]."

 griffons.46.t:0 "Ponies Beat Back Our Bid"
 griffons.46.d:0 "For many years the populace of [Root.GetName] considered the Equestrian city rather precisely named Village Up North to be rightfully part of their territory. Unfortunately, our hopes to use the recent civil war in Equestria to take control of this territory has failed. After a long and brutal border battle the Equestrian contingent in the State Up North was able to hold on long enough for the general in command to break off the attack in accordance with the previously agreed upon plan. Our diplomats will now try to play down the event while our press secretary for the people."
 griffons.46.a:0 "This is only a temporary delay!"

 griffons.47.t:0 "Stalemate on the Border"
 griffons.47.d:0 "Recently, an attack was made across the border by units of the griffon military into Equestria's territory of State Up North. Units from the Equestrian military intercepted them, but while the battle raged for several hours at the end of the day casualties were minor and the outcome indecisive. It looks like the current state of affairs will remain the same up north, which is good news for Equestria and allows them to focus more of their attention on their ongoing civil war."
 griffons.47.a:0 "The more things change, the more they stay the same."

 griffons.48.t:0 "[Root.GetName] Stands Strong in the North"
 griffons.48.d:0 "In a small bright spot in a sea of sorrow, our troops in the northernmost part of the nation have held back an attack by griffon troops who attempted to seize the city of Village Up North. The commander in charge has been sighted for heroism, and so have several soldiers under his command. In this time when everything seems to be falling apart this news shall surely boost morale."
 griffons.48.a:0 "Heroes, one and all."

 griffons.49.t:0 "Northernmost Point Captured by Griffonians"
 griffons.49.d:0 "In one more shameful event among many shameful events of late, the Village Up North, once famous for being the northernmost point of the nation, was seized by griffon troops following an intense border skirmish that left many on both sides dead. The local commander felt that his position would soon be overrun, and so ordered all troops to evacuate the state. He justified his position by stating that his supplies were threatened with being cut off, and that his troops could be put to far better use on the mainland."
 griffons.49.a:0 "Another landmark lost to the flames of war."
 griffons.49.b:0 "That was our call to make, not his!"
 griffons.49.c:0 "He has failed us for the last time."

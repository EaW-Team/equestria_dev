GRF_beak_mines:0 "Organize the Beak Mining Company"
GRF_beak_mines_desc:0 "The Beak Mountains are rich with minerals, minerals necessary to industrilize our nation. While the Beak Mountains have a number of smaller private owned mines, they hardly have the capacity to supply our fledgling nation. If we wish to see any progress, we must form a central mining company that shall carefully and in a somewhat orgnaized manner, extract the resources found on the mountainside."
GRF_dulli_mines:0 "Dulli Mines"
GRF_dulli_mines_desc:0 "The Dulli Mountains are a barely inhabited, but mineral rich strip of land. Opening up mines there would certainly be profitable, but we should remember to invest in some warm clothes for the workers."

GRF_northern_industry:0 "Northern Investment"
GRF_northern_industry_desc:0 "Despite the North being rather bleak and desolate, the various oil fields and refineries that have recently been opened; has oddly enough became one of our more populous states. In light of this information, we would be wise to invest in improving our industry there."

GRF_weter_university_desc:0 "For a long time most Griffons here in the colonies have had to go back to the Griffonia for any higher form of education, but with the continued unrest back home that is simply no longer an option.

GRF_good_economy:0 "Prosperity"
GRF_good_economy_desc:0 "After a long and gruelling uphill battle, we have finally managed to fix our disfunctional economy. Our future is no longer as dark as we once thought, as we have attained prosperity for the first time in our history."
GRF_dubious_friends:0 "Goldfeather's Associates"

GRF_interesting_friends:0 "Triton's Associates"
GRF_interesting_friends_desc:0 "It seems that Triton's arival in the Northen Provinces has drawn in Republicans from back home, even though they all seem to hold more loyalty towards Blackpeak then the actual government, their arrival has greatly helped expand the industry in the North."
GRF_immigration:0 "Weter Immigration Act"
GRF_immigration_desc:0 "Our country has never been particularly populous, and as our economy grows, that slowly becoming one of our biggest problems.

GRF_crush_commies_desc:0 "The GPP has been a thorn in our side ever since the Empire fell. With the success of the coup, most of their leadership was either killed or imprisoned, but they still persist in the countryside fighting a hopeless war.

GRF_crush_democrats:0 "Annihilate the GSDP"

GRF_arsenal_desc:0 "Oddly enough one of the few Griffons not rioting in the streets is Skeiron Goldfeather.

GRF_coalition:0 "Form a Coalition with the PGI"
GRF_coalition_desc:0 "The PGI is willing to join the government provided we allow some of their members to occupy high ranking positions in the junta's government. This might not be the best arrangement, but at least we will get decent allies out of this."
GRF_falcon_police:0 "Integrate the Falcons of Griffinstone" 
GRF_falcon_police_desc:0 "The Falcons of Griffinstone have long been a thorn in our side, but with our recent alliance with the PGI, they have actually proven themselves rather useful as vigilantes.

GRF_open_door:0 "The Open Door Act"

GRF_state_army:0 "The State of the Army"
GRF_state_army_desc:0 "Since our independence nearly thirty years ago, our army has been comprised mostly of local militias following elected leaders. While this has done wonders for morale, it is proving itself to be a bigger and bigger issue as our military operations grow in both complexity and size. No matter the solution, this issue must be fixed and it must be fixed soon."
GRF_automous_army:0 "More Local Autonomy" 
GRF_automous_army_desc:0 "The militias have done a decent enough job so far, we may as well give their officers more autonomy. What could possibly go wrong?"

GRF_artillery_production:0 "Standardized Artillery Manufacturing"
GRF_artillery_production_desc:0 "Since up until recently our army has never really had need for standardized artillery, with each seperate militia bringing their own or in most cases, not using any artillery at all. With the recent centralization of our command structure, this must change."
GRF_doctrine_1:0 "A Lot of Birds"
GRF_doctrine_1_desc:0 "The militia system will more then likely draw in more recruits ready to throw away their lives for their Nova Griffonia. However, the decentralised nature of our officer corp will make it practically impossible to perform complex military operations. Which leaves us with only one option: Throwing Griffons at the enemy and seeing what happens."
GRF_doctrine_2:0 "Plan and Pray"
GRF_doctrine_2_desc:0 "In the end we have decided to compromise with the militias, and while our officer corp isn't decentralised as it used to be, most of the more complex operations are still rather hard to execute.

GRF_army_service:0 "Influx of New Recruits"
GRF_army_service_desc:0 "We have recently begun noticing a suprising surge in the number recruits joining the army. We are not saying this is a bad thing, but woe be to any officer attempting to keep any semblance of order within our army these days."
GRF_special_forces:0 "The Skyhawks"
GRF_special_forces_desc:0 "The infamous "Skyhawk" battallion within our army has gained much popularity for their bravery and skillful display in both combat and training. We should put these upstanding fellows to good use, rather than let them rot in a training facility somewhere."
GRF_spec_ops_tech:0 "The Ministry of Ungentlecoltly Warfare"
GRF_spec_ops_tech_desc:0 " A modern war is unlikely to be won if we count on our general-purpose soldiers to do everything. Instead, we should train specialised units made just for these demanding, daring tasks."

GRF_glory_desc:0 "Our world ended nearly thirty years ago, when our grand empire fell. We found ourselves as strangers in an even stranger land, and yet while the old empire bleeds, we are prospering. Perhaps it is a sign that the future of our people will not be determined in the East, but rather the West?"
GRF_crown_highhill:0 "Crown Marshal Highill Imperator"
GRF_crown_highhill_desc:0 "Marshal Highill saved our nation during it's darkest hour, it is only appropriate that he should lead our new empire forward."
GRF_crown_ironclaw:0 "Crown Reyhard Ironclaw Imperator"
GRF_crown_ironclaw_desc:0 "When the GSDP and the GPP sought to whore out our homeland to foreign invaders, it was Ironclaw who fought for all Griffons, there is no better candidate for Emperor than him."

GRF_landings:0 "Amphibious Effort"
GRF_landings_desc:0 "With our maritime forces ruling the seas, it would be wise to invest in new, better cargo ships for troop transportation and possible future beach landings."
GRF_battleships:0 "Battleship Focus"
GRF_battleships_desc:0 "With guns so large they could destroy an enemy ship in one hit, and armour which shields it against any and all harm they could possibly face, Battleships are quite clearly the future for our Navy."
GRF_carriers:0 "Carrier Focus"

 ### Events ###
 griffons.1.t:0 "Teafeather's Assassination"
 griffons.1.d:0 "Chaos consumed the nation, as today on a warm Summer day Teafeather the long standing Governor of our fair nation was shot dead upon the steps of his manor. Unfortunately the assailant managed to escape before the police could respond, and without a scape-goat to blame the people turned on each other. The long standing tensions between the Communists, the Harmonists and the Fascists exploded and the streets ran red with the Griffon blood. By the time the military and the police managed to bring some semblance of order to the country thousands of Griffons lay dead in the streets. After a long and bloody day one simple question was upon the beak of every single Griffon. What happens next?"
 griffons.1.a:0 "Let us honour the fallen..."
 griffons.2.t:0 "A Long Day in Weter"
 griffons.2.d:0 "Chaos consumed the Griffon Colony, as today on a warm Summer day Governor Teafeather was shot upon the stairs of his manor. Unfortunately the assailant managed to escape before the police could arrive, and without a scape-goat to blame the Griffons turned on each other. The long standing tensions between the Communists, the Harmonists and the Fascists exploded and the streets ran red with Griffon blood. By the time the military and the police force managed to restore some semblance of order to the country thousands of Griffons lay dead. After a long and bloody day every Griffon had but one simple question. What happens next?"
 griffons.2.a:0 "Send our condolances"
 griffons.3.t:0 "The Highill Affair"
 griffons.3.d:0 "An interesting scene errupted today in the streets of Weter, as General Highill marched into the central council chamber of the Provisional Government in front of a colum of soldiers. Highill proceeded to denounce the government and attempted to dissolve the provisioanl government. Needless to say this did not sit well with the Council, no one is quite sure who fired the first shot, but in about ten seconds flat the city errupted into chaos once more. Today the future of our great nation shall truly be decided, shall democracy win or shall it be buried under Highill's ambition?"
 griffons.3.a:0 "Highill's troops win and abolish the Council"
 griffons.3.b:0 "The Council stops the coup, Highill is executed for treason."
 griffons.4.t:0 "The Elections of 1009"
 griffons.4.d:0 "With the country at least somewhat stable now, and with Highill dead the time has finally come for out very first elections."
 griffons.4.a:0 "The GSDP win the election"
 griffons.4.b:0 "The GPP wins the election"
 griffons.4.c:0 "The PGI wins the election"
 griffons.5.t:0 "Stalliongrad supports communists!"
 griffons.5.d:0 "We did not find any agents yet, but there are multiple reports of Stalliongraders moving into our country trough the Starlight Caverns most likely to sow dissent, bribe workers and spread their propaganda. We must find them as quick as possible."
 griffons.5.a:0 "No way!"
 griffons.6.t:0 ""
 griffons.6.d:0 "Our police successfully found all the places of occupation of Stalliongradian communists. We now have an opportunity to arrest all of them at once, or we could use them to bring the revolution to our country."
 griffons.6.a:0 "Arrest them and every worker related!"
 griffons.6.b:0 "Support them!"
 griffons.6.c:0 "Arrest only them!"
 griffons.8.t:0 "Civil War!"
 griffons.8.d:0 "Sparked by political crisis and Stalliongradian propaganda, riots and protests on the streets of our cities are going out of control. The situation is getting more and more serious every hour as armed left-wing protesters meet bands of nationalists and their sympathizers. Shootings in the city streets are heard more and more often."
 griffons.8.a:0 "Support the communists!"
 griffons.8.b:0 "Support the government!"
 griffons.0.t:0 "A Brief History"
 griffons.0.d:0 "The Griffon Colony on the Equestrian mainland has always been the odd child of the Old Griffon Empire. For nearly 200 years it has been the favoured place of exile for anyone who dared defy the Emperor, but at the same time it has been quite reliant on the Empire to provide it with desperatly needed industrial goods and weapons. The abundance of political exiles and Émigrés allowed the colony to quickly establish itself as an independant political entity, however due to the over-reliance on Imperial goods the economy has stagnated. To make matters worse in the 30 years that the empire has been dead those former exiles who under the old regime would have been killed have started forming their own political organizations and in some cases have radicalized and are calling for violent revolution. Just about the only thing keeping the country together is Governor Teafeather's charisma and sheer force of will. Only time will tell how long the fragile peace he's built will last."
 griffons.0.a:0 "I should have just played Equestria"
 griffons.11.t:0 "Stalliongradian Pressure"
 griffons.11.d:0 "Stalliongrad is trying to puppet you"
 griffons.11.a:0 "Why not"
 griffons.11.b:0 "Sod off"
 griffons.13.t:0 "A Grasp at Glory"
 griffons.13.d:0 "For 200 years we have merely been a colony of the Grand Griffonian Empire, but yet here we stand a bulwark of Griffonkind while the old empire lies in ruin. Here we stand more united then ever while our former countrymen shed eachother's blood in the names of false prophets, and yet we allow these idiots to claim themselves the descendants of our glorious empire! An empire that once spanned continents, an empire that once had millions upon millions of people living under it's glorious banner, but now it is dead, an empire now reduced to rubble. The time has come for us to face the facts; the East is lost, but our empire can rise again... this time in the West."
 griffons.13.a:0 "The Empire lives on"
 griffons.14.t:0 "The New Imperator"
 griffons.14.d:0 "Following his recent coup d’etat, Highill, newly appointed Leader of the Nova Griffonia, has now ordered for him to be officially crowned Emperor of the Griffons. The coronation took place inside the Grand Barracks of the capital, followed up by a speech of Highill to his subjects and a mighty military parade. “The days of chaos and instability are over,” Highill spoke to his people. “Our nation shall be one of unison, strength and determination. It is time for us to rise up and reclaim our rightful spot on the world stage! It is time to reclaim the honour and glory of the empire!” The speech was followed up by mighty choirs of cheering griffons down in the streets of the capital. Although he seems hot-headed and determined, it is still to see whether he is really to come back on his promises and goals. The world is holding its breath for the time being."
 griffons.14.a:0 "Long live the Imperator!"
 griffons.15.t:0 "The New Imperator"
 griffons.15.d:0 "As a result of the recent election, fascist party leader Ironclaw was made leader of the Griffons. Unsurprisingly, he and his followers would not be satisfied with the election result itself, and it was today announced that the griffons had crowned Ironclaw himself as their newest emperor. The coronation took place in an old plaza of the capital. Many hundreds of Griffons arrived to see the spectacle. A marching band of over 2000 soldiers commenced the ceremony, followed up by a speech from Ironclaw himself after which he then crowned himself emperor. “Today is our day,” Ironclaw said in his speech. “Today is the day we rid ourselves from the corrupt, degenerate and weak democracy that has been plaguing our beautiful country. Today we look forward eagerly. A new, bright future awaits us! Our destiny awaits!” The Griffons’ neighbours have visibly been growing nervous over these recent developments, and the world as a whole will have to look out for a stronger, united Griffon folk. We shall watch how this situation develops."
 griffons.15.a:0 "Long live the Imperator!"
 griffons.16.t:0 "The New Imperator"

 griffons.17.a:0 "What a loon."
 griffons.18.t:0 "Muck Requests Funds"
 griffons.18.d:0 "It's that time of year again, the time of year where Muck growels for funds. Once more he is promisign to fix the economic and bandit issues the Frontier faces on a hourly basis. What shall we do?"
 griffons.18.a:0 "Give him some money, see what happens."
 griffons.18.b:0 "They're on their own."
 griffons.19.t:0 "Muck's Request"
 griffons.19.d:0 "Despite all odds the powder keg that was the Frontier was stabilised by Governor Muck, and the people of the Frontier are requesting to join Nova Griffonia as a proper province."
 griffons.19.a:0 "We welcome them into the fold."
 griffons.20.t:0 "Muck's Amazing Muck Up"
 griffons.20.d:0 "Due to either willful ignorance or sheer stupidity bandits have taken over the frontier and killed or expelled most of our officials there. How will we proceed."
 griffons.20.a:0 "Time to settle this the old fashioned way!"
 griffons.20.b:0 "They're not worth it"
 griffons.21.t:0 "Highill's Criticism"
 griffons.21.d:0 "Field Marshal Highill the former military governor of Nova Griffonia and close friend of the now deceased Governor has taken to criticizing the Provisional Government for their mediocre attempts at restoring order to the country, and letting radicals run wild trough the streets unchecked. While not as beloved as Teafeather Highill still has the respect and more importantly the ears of most of our military, and his criticism won't do us any favours."
 griffons.21.a:0 "As if he could do any better"
 griffons.22.t:0 "PGI Soup Kitchens"
 griffons.22.d:0 "Suprising news from the poorer districts of Weter today, as several members of the PGI and even the infamous Falcons of Griffinstone have taken it upon themselves to open several soup kitchens in an effort to feed the poor. Why they've done this can only be speculated upon, but to most it is welcome to see that even in these dark times some basic kindness can still be found in the most unexpected places."
 griffons.22.a:0 "What's next, magic Mules?"
 griffons.23.t:0 "Clashes in the Streets"
 griffons.23.d:0 "Despite the PGI and the PGG agreeing to cease any and all violence between each other some of their more zealous members seemingly haven't gotten the memo. As today in the middle of Weter no less, the two sides clashed causing several dozen deaths, injuring hundreds and causing hundreds of thousands of bits in damage. Needless to say this little debacle hasn't done their representatives in the Provisional Government any favours."
 griffons.23.a:0 "It's like herding cats..."
 griffons.24.t:0 "GSDP Scandal"
 griffons.24.d:0 "An interesting scandal has come up in the Provisional Government today, as it was discovered GSDP representative has had no less than 27 affairs with creatures ranging from Thestreals to Dragons... needless to say the GSDP representatives were left speechless. Perhaps because of the sheer insanity of it all or their fellow representative's interesting choice of lovers."
 griffons.24.a:0 "He certainly doesn't like vanilla..."
 griffons.25.t:0 "Workers Strike"
 griffons.25.d:0 "Several trade unions have utilized the chaos in the country to protest what they call "abhorrent working conditions" in our factories. Apparently they've deluded themselves into thinking that child labour is something that should be abolished, and while their message was rather nice and all we dobut anyone could have heard them over the burning buildings and gunshots ringing out trough the entire country."
 griffons.25.a:0 "Children not working? What's next, hairless apes walking about?"
 griffons.26.t:0 "The Death of Griffonian Democracy"
 griffons.26.d:0 "Not long ago Governor Teafeather was assassinated and a Provisional Government was formed in Weter until the country could stabilized. The goal of the government was to eventually give way to a democratic elections, however it seems that such an election shall not be happening any time soon. As a day ago Field Marshal Highill marched upon the governmental palace at the front of a column of soldiers and proceeded to disolve the Provisional Government. Griffonia's future now rests in Highill's claws."
 griffons.26.a:0 "Democracy was just a pipe dream for them it seems..."
 griffons.27.t:0 "Griffonian Democracy"
 griffons.27.d:0 "Not long ago Governor Teafeather was assassinated and a Provisional Government was formed in Weter until the country could stabilized. The goal of the government was to eventually give way to a democratic elections, and despite the efforts of the now deceased Marshal Highill it seems that democracy at least for now has prevailed."
 griffons.27.a:0 "They are free of the Old Empire's shackles."
 griffons.28.t:0 "The War"
 griffons.28.d:0 "After months of makign practically no progress in ridding the Frontier of Virgil and his bandits the support for our was has hit an all time low. Many of our populace are demanding we withdraw and stop wasting Griffon lives on an useless piece of land."
 griffons.28.a:0 "We've got no other option..."
 griffons.28.b:0 "Faithless cowards! We'll win this war or die trying!"
 griffons.29.t:0 "The Frontier"
 griffons.29.d:0 "It seems that Heinrich has somehow managed to take over the Frontier. However with his original intnetion of bringing the revolution to Nova Griffonia becoming somewhat redundant he's decided that he wishes to rejoin our nation once more."
 griffons.29.a:0 "Welcome back brother!"
 griffons.30.t:0 "Skeiron's Schemeing"
 griffons.30.d:0 "Unsuprisingly to anyone whom knows him, Skeiron used his newfound power as our economic minister to seize some foreign factories, which he quickly incorporated into Talon Gunworks. While this doesn't hurt us per se; on the contrary it's rather useful, it is still a very blatant abuse of power and reflects poorly on our government."
 griffons.30.a:0 "At least warn us next time Goldfether"
 griffons.31.t:0 "Griffonian Migrants"
 griffons.31.d:0 "Yet another batch arrived today, fleeing Griffonia with naught but their clothes on their backs. They hope to find a better future here far from the wars of the Old Empire, and we welcome them with open wings."
 griffons.31.a:0 "Welcome to Nova Griffonia!"
 griffons.32.t:0 "Intervening in the Equestrian Civil War"
 griffons.32.d:0 "We've received horrible news from Equestria today, as it seems that Princess Luna has yet again turned into Nightmare Moon. How the Equestrians didn't see this happening is anyone's guess, but most of our citizens and more importantly our advisors seem to be of the belief that should Nighmare Moon win the Civil War she will eventually set her sights on us. What shall we do?"
 griffons.32.a:0 "Send the Equestrians some guns and call it a day."
 griffons.32.b:0 "Arm some volunteers and send them to Equestria."
 griffons.32.c:0 "This really does not concern us."
 griffons.33.t:0 "Griffon Volunteers Arrive"
 griffons.33.d:0 "It seems that the Griffons perhaps realizing the threat that Nightmare Moon poses to the entire world have sent some volunteers to help us fight her forces."
 griffons.33.a:0 "At least it's something."
 griffons.34.t:0 "The Changeling-Equestria War"
 griffons.34.d:0 "It seems that the Changelings have decided to invade Equestria, and while we don't exactly like either side, it's better to have the Equestrians at our doorstep than the Changelings. Thus some of our advisors have recommended that we send some assistance to the Equestrians."
 griffons.34.a:0 "Send them some equipment I'm sure they'll appreciate it."
 griffons.34.b:0 "Arm a couple of volunteer regiments and ship them off."
 griffons.34.c:0 "We've got better things to do."
 griffons.35.t:0 "Griffon Volunteers Arrive"
 griffons.35.d:0 "It seems that the Griffons perhaps realizing the threat that Changelings pose to the entire world have sent some volunteers to help us fight their forces."

### National Focuses ###
GRF_new_economy:0 "New Economic Policy"
GRF_new_economy_desc:0 "It has become obvious that the Griffonian Empire will not reunite in the near future, leaving us without our primary source of manufactured goods and practically crashing our economy. Only quick and decisive action will be able to save us from the brink of utter collapse now."
GRF_beak_mines:0 "Organise the Beak Mining Company"
GRF_beak_mines_desc:0 "The Beak Mountains are rich with minerals, minerals necessary to industrialise our nation. While the Beak Mountains have a number of smaller private owned mines, they hardly have the capacity to supply our fledgling nation. If we wish to see any progress, we must form a central mining company that shall carefully and in a somewhat organised manner, extract the resources found on the mountainside."
GRF_dulli_mines:0 "Dulli Mines"
GRF_dulli_mines_desc:0 "The Dulli Mountains are a barely inhabited, but mineral rich strip of land. Opening up mines there would certainly be profitable, but we should remember to invest in some warm clothes for the workers."
GRF_northern_oil:0 "Northern Oil Fields"
GRF_northern_oil_desc:0 "Sure the northern-most provinces are bleak, boring and up until recently, completely useless. However with the discovery of oil along the Northern coast and in the foothills of the Onear Mountains, the Northern Provinces are now officially recognised as only bleak and boring."
GRF_southern_roads:0 "Southern Railways"
GRF_southern_roads_desc:0 "Communication lines between the capital and the rest of the country are rather strained. The old courier networks around the country are no longer efficient or cost effective. So we have decided to take a page out of Equestria's book and construct a railway network stretching from the Beak Mountains to Weter."
GRF_northern_roads:0 "Northern Railways"
GRF_northern_roads_desc:0 "With the new oil fields in the north we must ensure that not a single drop of oil is lost in transit, to this end we have decided to fund the construction of a railway connecting the Northern Territories to Weter."
GRF_southern_industry:0 "Weter Industrial Centre"
GRF_southern_industry_desc:0 "In spite of all the setbacks we have suffered as a nation, our efforts have finally managed to attract enough investors to allow us to set up a proper industrial centre in Weter."
GRF_military_south:0 "Goldfeather's Talon Gunworks"
GRF_military_south_desc:0 "We have recently been contacted by one Skeiron Goldfeather, one of the richest aristocrats from the old country, whom up until recently was heavily involved in the Equestrian arms trade. However due to issues back home, Goldfeather has decided that change of scenery is in order and has offered the services of both himself, and his "Talon Gunworks"."
GRF_northern_industry:0 "Northern Investment"
GRF_northern_industry_desc:0 "Despite the North being rather bleak and desolate, the various oil fields and refineries that have recently been opened; has oddly enough became one of our more populous states. In light of this information, we would be wise to invest in improving our industry there."
GRF_military_north:0 "Triton Gunworks"
GRF_military_north_desc:0 "With the continued economic growth in the North we have managed to attract several industrialists from back home. One such individual is Triton Blackpeak, who was recently exiled from Griffonstone due to reasons he isn't willing to disclose. Never the less Triton has offered to open up several new arms factories in the frigid north."
GRF_weter_university:0 "Fund the Weter University"
GRF_weter_university_desc:0 "For a long time most griffons here in the colonies have had to go back to the Griffonia for any higher form of education, but with the continued unrest back home that is simply no longer an option. If we wish to insure the future of our nation, we will need an educated elite; so to that end we have decided to retrofit several old administrative buildings in Weter into a new university."
GRF_good_economy:0 "Economic Recovery"
GRF_good_economy_desc:0 "After a long and gruelling uphill battle, we have finally managed to fix our dysfunctional economy. Our future is no longer as dark as we once thought, as we have attained Economic Independence for the first time in our history."
GRF_dubious_friends:0 "Goldfeather's Associates"
GRF_dubious_friends_desc:0 "Goldfeather has always been a bit of a shifty fellow, but no one can deny that him and his "friends" get results, and as long as he gets results; there is no reason to crack down on him or his friends."
GRF_interesting_friends:0 "Triton's Associates"
GRF_interesting_friends_desc:0 "It seems that Triton's arrival in the Northern Provinces has drawn in Republicans from back home, even though they all seem to hold more loyalty towards Blackpeak then the actual government, their arrival has greatly helped expand the industry in the North."
GRF_immigration:0 "Weter Immigration Act"
GRF_immigration_desc:0 "Our country has never been particularly populous, and as our economy grows, that slowly becoming one of our biggest problems. In an attempt to fix this issue, the Governor has put forward a bill that would allow any griffon born in Griffonia proper immigration rights to our country."
GRF_troubles_begin:0 "Utter Chaos"
GRF_troubles_begin_desc:0 "The nation is in disarray. Everything is on fire, people are killing each other in the streets, and religious nuts are proclaiming it to be the end of the world as we know it. It seems our troubles have only just begun."

GRF_douse_the_flames:0 "Begin Stabilisation"
GRF_douse_the_flames_desc:0 "With Teafeather's death the country has erupted into utter chaos. Thankfully we have finally managed to gather every political party in the country into the same room to fix the issue. Let us hope they don't make everything worse."
GRF_free_elections:0 "Democracy Prevails!"
GRF_free_elections_desc:0 "Despite Highhill's attempted coup, the Provisional Government has managed to maintain their power and proper elections shall soon take place."
GRF_fight_the_opposition:0 "Fight the Opposition"

GRF_crush_commies:0 "Crush the Communists"
GRF_crush_commies_desc:0 "The NGSF has been a thorn in our side ever since the Empire fell. With the success of the coup, most of their leadership was either killed or imprisoned, but they still persist in the countryside fighting a hopeless war. If we intend to achieve any measure of peace we must wipe out this last vestige of the Red Plague."
GRF_crush_democrats:0 "Annihilate the NGDF"
GRF_crush_democrats_desc:0 "The NGDF and their so called "democracy" sought to destroy our traditions, our faith and dilute the spirit of our people. Let us reward them the fate all traitors deserve!"
GRF_deal_with_the_devil:0 "A Deal with Discord"
GRF_deal_with_the_devil_desc:0 "The FfIfG has proven oddly receptive of the junta's policies; perhaps we should reconsider our stance towards them?"
GRF_vacation:0 "A Vacation in Dulli"
GRF_vacation_desc:0 "While many NGSF leaders were killed during the coup, many more were either arrested or fled the country. Perhaps we should consider giving them a nice little vacation in the Dulli Mountains?"
GRF_arsenal:0 "Dealing with Goldfeather"
GRF_arsenal_desc:0 "Oddly enough one of the few griffons not rioting in the streets is Skeiron Goldfeather. In fact, not only did he refuse to riot in the streets; he actually offered to provide his economic expertise and support to our government. All he demands in return is a position in our government as the new minister of finance."
GRF_coalition:0 "Form a Coalition with the FfIfG"
GRF_coalition_desc:0 "The FfIfG is willing to join the government provided we allow some of their members to occupy high ranking positions in the junta's government. This might not be the best arrangement, but at least we will get decent allies out of this."
GRF_falcon_police:0 "Integrate the Falcons of Griffonstone" 
GRF_falcon_police_desc:0 "The Falcons of Griffonstone have long been a thorn in our side, but with our recent alliance with the FfIfG, they have actually proven themselves rather useful as vigilantes. We might as well spare ourselves the future legal headaches, and make them an official auxiliary unit within the already existing gendarmerie."
GRF_new_dawn:0 "A New Dawn" 
GRF_new_dawn_desc:0 "In the end, and despite all the setbacks, the bloodshed, and the betrayals Highhill reigns supreme. The future of both the country and the griffon people are in his claws."
GRF_owls:0 "Organise the Owls"
GRF_owls_desc:0 "He, who has total control, is best advised to eliminate those who dare plot to remove him from power. With a secret, undercover police and intelligence force, we can detect and eliminate even the smallest pockets of resistance and opposition."
GRF_harmonists_win:0 "A Victory for Democracy"
GRF_harmonists_win_desc:0 "To no one's surprise the NGDF, have won the election."
GRF_commies_win:0 "A Victory for the People"
GRF_commies_win_desc:0 "The NGSF has managed to achieve victory in the elections. The future of the griffon people now rests in their claws."
GRF_fascists_win:0 "An Unlikely Result"
GRF_fascists_win_desc:0 "Despite all odds being stacked against them, the FfIfG has managed to win the election; our future is now in their claws... unfortunately."
GRF_GPP_industry:0 "The Redtail Plan" 
GRF_GPP_industry_desc:0 "Despite the leaps we have made economically under Governor Teafeather, many griffons still find themselves jobless. The people have put their trust in us to fix this issue, and we shall."
GRF_welfare:0 "NGDF Welfare Program"
GRF_welfare_desc:0 "For far too long our citizens have suffered through poverty, hunger, and death. Well no more! From this day forth every citizen, no matter how small or insignificant they might, be shall be entitled to their share of the wealth."
GRF_GSDP_industry:0 "Jobs for the People"
GRF_GSDP_industry_desc:0 "Many of our citizens are still jobless, begging in the street merely to sustain them; we simply cannot allow this to continue. The state will step in and create new jobs four our citizens."
GRF_the_republican_guard:0 "The Republican Guard"
GRF_the_republican_guard_desc:0 "If Highhill has shown us anything, it's that the soldiers in our country tend to be more loyal to their commanders than the actual government, to ensure the Republic doesn't face anything similar to Highhill's Coup ever again, we shall form a corps whose sole job shall be to protect the President, the Senate and most importantly the Constitution."
GRF_open_door:0 "The Open Door Act"
GRF_open_door_desc:0 "From this day forth, any living creature in this world shall be permitted to live upon our country's soil, no matter their origin or status. We shall welcome them all with a warm smile and our wings spread to embrace them."
GRF_breakup:0 "Disperse the Falcons"
GRF_breakup_desc:0 "Ironclaw has been a pain in the flank to everyone for nearly a decade now, and with the rapid decline of the FfIfG his Falcons have become even more violent. The time has come to end this farce of an organisation and send the Falcons to Tartarus where they rightfully belong."
GRF_arsenal_democracy:0 "Arsenal of Harmony"
GRF_arsenal_democracy_desc:0 "We fought for our freedom, we fought to make Nova Griffonia harmonious for all, and yet it is not enough. We must defend not just ourselves, but any and all who tread the path of Harmony."
GRF_liberty:0 "Liberty, Justice, Solidarity!"
GRF_liberty_desc:0 "Despite all the insanity that went down after Teafeather's death, we have managed to preserve our freedom... for now."
GRF_falcon_win:0 "Integrate the Falcons"
GRF_falcon_win_desc:0 "If if the last couple of months have proven anything, it is that we simply cannot trust the average footman nor police officer to protect the state or it's interests. In an effort to fix this issue, the Falcons shall be integrated into the state apparatus as a sort of gendarmerie that shall have absolute power to detain any suspected enemies of the state."
GRF_prepare_for_war:0 "Expand the Arms Industry"
GRF_prepare_for_war_desc:0 "If we mean to defend ourselves from any future threats we must expand our arms industry, this will also help fix some of the unemployment issues we have been having."
GRF_fight_to_win:0 "Victory or Death"
GRF_fight_to_win_desc:0 "The war that determines the fate of our nation is upon the horizon. There shall be no surrender, no retreat, only victory or death."
GRF_national_oil:0 "Nationalise the Northern Oil Industry"
GRF_national_oil_desc:0 "Our oil industry has been run by greedy kleptocrats and foreign aristocrats for far too long, we will not abide this for any longer. Seizing these industries for the state will benefit us in the long run."
GRF_camps:0 "Friendship Clubs"
GRF_camps_desc:0 "We really should begin looking into "re-educating" our former political enemies."
GRF_triumph:0 "Ironclaw's Triumph"
GRF_triumph_desc:0 "Despite the many setbacks we have finally managed to eliminate all of the traitors, it is time that we turn our gaze towards our glorious future."
GRF_state_military:0 "The State of the Military"
GRF_state_military_desc:0 "We should commission a report on the state of our military. With the country moving into the new millennium our armed forces will face new challenges, and before we can tackle those, we will need a precise summary on our current situation."
GRF_state_army:0 "The Nova Griffonian Army"
GRF_state_army_desc:0 "Since our independence nearly thirty years ago, our army has been comprised mostly of local militias following elected leaders. While this has done wonders for morale, it is proving itself to be a bigger and bigger issue as our military operations grow in both complexity and size. No matter the solution, this issue must be fixed and it must be fixed soon."
GRF_automous_army:0 "Increase Militia Autonomy" 
GRF_automous_army_desc:0 "The militias have done a decent enough job so far, we may as well give their officers more autonomy. Who but the officers would know how to lead their griffons best?"
GRF_compromise_army:0 "The Art of Compromise" 
GRF_compromise_army_desc:0 "In the end we have decided to let the militias have a limited degree of autonomy. They shall retain the right to elect their officers. However, those officers must follow orders from high command, whether they like them or not."
GRF_organized_army:0 "Reform the Militias"
GRF_organized_army_desc:0 "It is time to rid ourselves of the quarrelsome militias. Our country will not suffer any insubordination in its army. Only a unified command structure following orders from the top down will be able to face the challenges of modern war."
GRF_mass_assault_f:0 "Griffon Wave Tactics"
GRF_mass_assault_f_desc:0 "The bravery of Nova Griffonians is unmatched! Go, Children of Boreas! Smash the enemies like just like the waves smash the cliffs of Weter."
GRF_grand_battleplan_f:0 "Trench Warfare"
GRF_grand_battleplan_f_desc:0 "Our doctrine will be modelled after the old art of besieging castles. We shall dig miles of deep trenches to protect our precious soldiers while they close in and slowly occupy more ground."
GRF_superior_firepower_f:0 "Creeping Barrage"
GRF_superior_firepower_f_desc:0 "Let's flood our enemies in an ocean of fire and steel! Shells from our cannons will blot out the sun!"
GRF_mobile_warfare_f:0 "Copy the Changelings"
GRF_mobile_warfare_f_desc:0 "The Changeling Army is probably the best fighting force on Equus, if not the entire world. Therefore, their revolutionizing doctrine of mobile warfare is the best choice for our military."
GRF_military_research_department:0 "Create the Military Research Department"
GRF_military_research_department_desc:0 "As a country located on Equus, we need to compete in terms of military research with countries miles ahead in technology compared to old Griffonia. We need military technology which can compete with the changelings and equestrians. This won't be an easy task, but with determination and endurance we shall prevail!"
GRF_radio_f:0 "Radio Implementation"
GRF_radio_f_desc:0 "The world rapidly changes around us. We have access to things we thought to be magic and witchcraft just a few decades ago. One of these things is the radio. This ground-breaking piece of technology can vastly improve communication all across the Army. We should implement it immediately."
GRF_rocket_artillery_f:0 "Adopt the Nebelwerfer"
GRF_rocket_artillery_f_desc:0 "Our old overlords from Griffenheim have developed a new rocket launcher - the "Nebelwerfer". They wanted to keep their project a total secret. However, during the final phase of development one of the scientists betrayed the Empire and escaped. And so it happens that there is one particular country which is always keen to give asylum to all imperial exiles... "
GRF_light_tank_f:0 "Import Changeling Panzers"
GRF_light_tank_f_desc:0 "Recently our government received an interesting proposal from the changeling government. They offer to sell some of their older panzer models for a surprisingly low price. These tanks will be an excellent base for future development of armoured vehicles. Send a telegraph to Vesalipolis at once!"
GRF_medium_tank_f:0 "Thicker Plating"
GRF_medium_tank_f_desc:0 "We managed to learn a lot from the field tests conducted on the panzers provided by the changelings. If implemented correctly, these metal monsters can wreak havoc on the battlefields. However, anti-tank guns are being developed in tandem with the tanks. If we are to keep an edge over enemy infantry, we need to produce tanks with thicker plates and bigger guns."
GRF_magical_rifles:0 "Our Own Magical Rifles"
GRF_magical_rifles_desc:0 "Equestrian scientists from the Luna Nova Academy recently come to a stunning discovery. It turns out that the magical energy from the purple crystals often found in the mountains can be used in weaponry! This is an opportunity we cannot miss. Nova Griffonia will produce its own magical rifles."
GRF_standard_rifles:0 "Standardise Rifle Models"
GRF_standard_rifles_desc:0 "After our separation from the Empire we were forced to import many differently designed rifle models from abroad. This caused logistical and production problems. In order to fix these issues we need analyse the current situation and choose one common rifle model for the entire army."
GRF_standard_artillery:0 "Implement The Cowitzer"
GRF_standard_artillery_desc:0 "A few years ago we managed to strike a great deal with Equestria. We acquired a modern artillery piece called "Cowtizer," we need to inspect it and create a new version suitable to our needs. May Eyr bless our shells!"
GRF_standard_support:0 "Support Squad Implementation"
GRF_standard_support_desc:0 "Recent military conflicts such as the Battle of Canterlot in 1002 showed us that in order to succeed, regular infantry needs to be supported by smaller units of soldiers trained for specific tasks. Intelligence reports say that other armies are already adding these companies to their divisions. Why shouldn't we?"
GRF_motorized_f:0 "Army Motorisation Effort"
GRF_motorized_f_desc:0 "Only a fool would deny the military potential of wheeled machines such as cars and trucks. We need to focus our efforts on motorizing the army to ensure its speed and modernity."
GRF_heavy_tank_f:0 "A Heavy Tank"
GRF_heavy_tank_f_desc:0 "As technology progresses it is becoming clear that we need a heavier tank variant to round out our arsenal of mobile weapons. With the thickest armour and the most devastating guns, these panzers will be able to break through any enemy strongpoint with ease. All we need is a design."
GRF_general_staff:0 "Reform the General Staff"
GRF_general_staff_desc:0 "The army's General Staff is comprised mostly of old veterans of the countless wars which plagued Griffonia in the 970s. Although the old guard's skill and experience cannot be questioned, we should allow younger officers to put their creative plans and strategies to the test. We cannot be stuck in the 10th century forever."
GRF_ranger_corps:0 "Create the Nova Griffonian Ranger Corps"
GRF_ranger_corps_desc:0 "Nova Griffonia is a vast country - forests and mountains often stretch for hundreds of kilometres. In order to patrol this wilderness more efficiently we should establish a new military force - The Nova Griffonian Ranger Corps. Claw-picked from the best units, the Rangers will specialise in reconnaissance, survival and combat in difficult terrain"
GRF_mountain_training:0 "Standing On the Back Of Giants"
GRF_mountain_training_desc:0 "Northern Nova Griffonia is almost entirely comprised of mountain ranges. Our army needs to excel at fighting in this type of terrain. This will require special high-altitude flying lessons, as well as specialised lightweight equipment for easy manoeuvres in a three-dimensional combat environment."
GRF_train_officers:0 "Standardised Officer Training"
GRF_train_officers_desc:0 "Ever since Nova Griffonia became independent the general skill and quality of our officer corps is all over the place. Although we are lucky to have some experienced exiles from Griffonia, most of the officers are young griffons from local militia units - with often little to no training at all. This is why we need to make efforts to put officer training standards on a higher level."
GRF_expand_corps:0 "Expand the Ranger Corps"
GRF_expand_corps_desc:0 "The introduction of the Ranger Corps turned out to be a giant success. The combat potential of our army has been greatly increased thanks to these brave griffons. We need to play to our strengths by expanding the corps."
GRF_reserveist_system:0 "Implement The Reservist System"
GRF_reserveist_system_desc:0 "As griffons we need to remember that we are surrounded by creatures of different races and cultures - they will never fully trust us. That's why we need to implement a special system of emergency military service in case of an external military threat."
GRF_armoury_system:0 "Standardised Armouries"
GRF_armoury_system_desc:0 "Our arms industry has fallen behind compared to those of larger Equus countries. We need to create more military factories designed to produce large amounts of modern equipment."
GRF_finish_reforms:0 "The Finest Army On Equus"
GRF_finish_reforms_desc:0 "Finally, after years of bold reforms we managed to create an effective and powerful military force. Glory to the Nova Griffonian Army, the Shield of Griffonkind on Equus!"
GRF_state_airforce:0 "The Nova Griffonian Air Force" 
GRF_state_airforce_desc:0 "The state of our current air corps is embarrassing to griffonkind. We must modernise our air force and reclaim the skies!"
GRF_strat_destruction:0 "Bomb Them To Tartarus"
GRF_strat_destruction_desc:0 "The only way to truly break an enemy is to break their will, break their morale and ruin their spirit. To hear the enemy planes bombing you to Tartarus as the soldiers rush at you, feeling the shrapnel go through your skull and break your bones. This is the warfare of the future."
GRF_air_superior:0 "Control The Skies"
GRF_air_superior_desc:0 "In combined arms warfare it is just as important to control the air as it is to control the ground, aerial support for the ground army paves the way for them to push into the enemy lines, while breaking enemy pushes with aerial bombardment and close air support. This is the warfare of the future."
GRF_operational_integrit:0 "Operational Integrity"
GRF_operational_integrit_desc:0 "Combining the griffon, the tank and the plane. We must train our troops and drill into them a cooperation between branches that they will never forget. To defeat our ever improving opponents we ourselves must improve and keep to the times, get ahead of the curve and defeat them. This is the warfare of the future."
GRF_expand_airbases:0 "A Nation of Airfields"
GRF_expand_airbases_desc:0 "We could have all the planes in the world, but with no runways to fly those from they are useless. The new airfields will stretch all across Nova Griffonia, from Weter to Federstadt, we will control the skies with all our might."
GRF_strat_bombers_focus:0 "Strategic Bombing"
GRF_strat_bombers_focus_desc:0 "We could easily waste thousands of bombs destroying every inch of our enemies, breaking their homes, workplaces and stores. But this is only a waste of potential. Bombing specific industrial sectors, fortifications and roads, combined with aerial support for our army will make the enemy buckle under our pressure."
GRF_tact_bombers_focus:0 "Develop Long Range Bombers"
GRF_tact_bombers_focus_desc:0 "To bomb our enemies we must reach them first, if we are to fight a large nation more powerful than us we must be able to use our planes. So to do this we shall make our finest scientists find new technology for long-range aerial bombardment."
GRF_jets:0 "Jet Experiments"
GRF_jets_desc:0 "Yet all know that in flight, speed is key. Reaching our enemies shores, bombarding their industries, shooting down their fighters. For this we will need new technology, which outpaces our enemies in leaps and bounds. Jet technology is strapping a rocket to a plane and hoping it doesn't explode. Can't be that complicated, can it?"
GRF_close_air_support_focus:0 "Aerial Ground Support"
GRF_close_air_support_focus_desc:0 "With close air support our troops will have all the help they need, their enemies mowed down by a fighter’s turret, their artillery wracked by aerial barrages and the enemy's morale lowered as they hear the din of our engines, but not their own."
GRF_paratroopers:0 "The Skyhawks Elite"
GRF_paratroopers_desc:0 "We can invade our enemies through land, through the seas or now as the scientists tell us. Through the air! Giving our griffons parachutes and having them jump off of transport planes. Landing in enemy territory, taking their airfields and forts, striking them from behind before they even know what hit them."
GRF_fighter_focus:0 "Develop Fighter Craft"
GRF_fighter_focus_desc:0 "To control the air we must have fighters to hold it, the newest technology and the strongest of turrets. We must have wings of aluminium and pilots with hearts of steel. We will control the sky, there is no doubt."
GRF_heavy_fighter_focus:0 "Heavy Fighter Craft"
GRF_heavy_fighter_focus_desc:0 "While fighters are powerful things, they are light and soft. So, what better way to counter this than to make our own heavy fighters, turning our enemies’ planes to dust and destroying their bombers?"
GRF_rule_the_skies:0 "The Kings of The Skies"
GRF_rule_the_skies_desc:0 "The griffon has been the king of the sky for as long as the world can remember and now we have reasserted our position as the kings of the sky. This time, however, with the help of technology. We have become a great aerial power that will find no match against our enemies. Truly, we have done a good job here."
GRF_state_navy:0 "The Nova Griffonian Navy"
GRF_state_navy_desc:0 "For too long our Navy has been getting the short end of the stick, and as such has been left in a dismal sate. We must improve our naval power!"
GRF_cat_base_strike_f:0 "Base-Strike Doctrine"
GRF_cat_base_strike_f_desc:0 "The Base-Strike Doctrine is simple, if we destroy our enemies’ fleets while they are still at base they will be easily sunk to the bottom of the sea."
GRF_carrier_f:0 "Carrier Experiments"
GRF_carrier_f_desc:0 "The Aircraft Carrier has been a concept thrown around by our leading naval theorists for years. The idea of a ship designed for sea based airfields is tantalizing though expensive. But it is finally time to invest in this idea."
GRF_naval_aviation_f:0 "Naval Aviation Department"
GRF_naval_aviation_f_desc:0 "The naval bomber is a fine idea, a plane designed specifically for bombing our enemies’ fleets into the depths of the sea, never to be found again."
GRF_cat_fleet_in_being_f:0 "Old School Tactics"
GRF_cat_fleet_in_being_f_desc:0 "The old naval doctrine has worked fine for us for many years, with its focus on large ships to project power. A fleet of the finest battleships, a massive fleet ready for battle at a moment's notice and able to tear a ship in half with one battery!"
GRF_mystic_dock:0 "Construct the Nouvelle Aquila Shipyards"
GRF_mystic_dock_desc:0 "We cannot have a proper navy if we do not have dockyards to build it, but this will be changed with the all new Nouvelle Aquila Shipyards. The perfect place for us to build a new fleet to rival all of our enemies with."
GRF_light_cruiser_f:0 "The Cruiser Squadrons"
GRF_light_cruiser_f_desc:0 "A squadron of cruisers to patrol our seas will be a useful thing indeed, with enough of them supporting our ships we will be able to defeat any enemy that tries to best us."
GRF_battlecruiser_f:0 "Battlecruiser Experiments"
GRF_battlecruiser_f_desc:0 "A cruiser is good, but a Battlecruiser, now that is a tempting type of ship that anyone would want! We have put our leading naval scientists upon the task of figuring out how to make them."
GRF_battleship_f:0 "The Battleship Plan"
GRF_battleship_f_desc:0 "But in the end, nothing beats a battleship. Large enough to destroy five enemies and not take a hit, batteries strong enough to pulverize all that oppose it. The battleship has always worked, and it will keep working."
GRF_cat_trade_interdiction_f:0 "Harassing The Supply Lines"
GRF_cat_trade_interdiction_f_desc:0 "Without being able to trade resources our enemies will be starved from the start of the war, unable to refuel their fleets or keep their factories running. This will mean we will easily win."
GRF_destroyer_f:0 "The Convoy Destruction Fleet"
GRF_destroyer_f_desc:0 "Cheap destroyers will make it easier for our nation to destroy our enemies’ ships, from the Rocky seas to the Celestial Shores trade will be controlled by us!"
GRF_submarine_f:0 "The Hidden Fleet"
GRF_submarine_f_desc:0 "Yet under the water lies our secret weapon, a powerful new force in the naval war that is almost impossible to beat. The submarine, hidden away from the sight of our enemies and able to strike at a moment's notice. They won't notice until it's too late."
GRF_massive_expansion:0 "The Dockyard Expansion Scheme"
GRF_massive_expansion_desc:0 "With all these new developments and the constant buzz within our naval community it is time for us to get more dockyards to sate the navy’s demands for ships. Truly this is a new age for the Nova Griffonian navy."
GRF_breakup_commies:0 "Destroy the Falcons"
GRF_breakup_commies_desc:0 "The Falcons of Griffonstone, since their formation has done everything in their power to keep the workers of our fair nation down through acts of violence and bloodshed. It's about time we pay them back for all the blood they have needlessly spilt."
GRF_worker_solidarity:0 "Solidarity of the Proletariat"
GRF_worker_solidarity_desc:0 "The only way we shall beat the bourgeois is trough solidarity with our fellow workers! Let us do away sectarianism and embrace our brothers and sisters in Stalliongrad!"

### Leader Descriptions ###
teabird_desc:0 "Scion of minor Imperial nobility far from home, Governor Teafeather made his reputation as a capable, charismatic leader of the Griffonian Colony. But for all his talent, he could not prevent the economic collapse caused by the Empire's downfall, and he keeps struggling to keep the nation together ever since. Fortunately for him, the public opinion is firmly on his side, and the extremist elements are marginalised. He yearns for the day the colony can stand for itself again, leaving him free to retire and return to his family in Brantbeak. With his newly developed economic plan, that day is set to come very soon."
always_depressed_desc:0 "Wilhelm Silverwing, once a popular militia commander, has swapped his military battlefield with a political one. He simply could not rest as he saw many destitute griffons lacking basic necessities such as shelter, food or even jobs. Thus, he and his party worked closely with Governor Teafeather to fund the welfare programs, with the little money they could secure in the nation's crashed economy. While not as popular as the Governor, Wilhelm earned the approval of the lower classes.\n\nFew grieved as much as he did on Teafeather's funeral, but it was no time to weep. Through his old contacts in the militia, he learned of the planned coup, and he could not allow this. Thus, Erwin Highhill's coup was nipped before it could truly spread, allowing for true democracy to choose the nation's next leader. With the extremist parties drawing little support, the griffons, who wished for prosperity to return, elected Silverwing with a large majority in the newly formed Republic of Nova Griffonia."
chadhill_desc:0 "Marshal Erwin Highhill has led a storied life before assuming complete control of the griffon colony. Once, he was a general in the Griffonian Empire's army, back in the day when it was still a unified, but quickly crumbling force. He quickly became infamous for routinely ignoring orders from the high command, always complaining that his strategic genius was being undermined. Erwin was too connected with the nobility to be forcibly relieved of his duty without a hassle. Instead, the high command offered Highhill the position of supreme military commander of the Griffonian Colony. Eager for glory, he accepted without pause.\n\nUnfortunately, he quickly realised that his "promotion" was but a derogatory reassignment, from which he couldn't turn back, and furthermore, as the Empire collapsed, things turned all the more sour. Stuck in a foreign land, he could do little more but annoy Governor Teafeather with demands for increased military budget, while instilling a sense of personal loyalty in his troops.\n\nSome say he had a claw in Teafeather's assassination. It matters not what anygriffon says now, for Marshal Highhill has finally achieved his dream - undisputed authority."
ultimate_griffon_desc:0 "Founder and CEO of the Talon Gunworks, Skeiron Goldfeather has always been notorious for his unhealthy obsession with wealth. It was his greed that led to his exile from the capitalist haven of Skyfall. While stories vary on what exactly was the reason, all can agree that he crossed a line, and the Iron Chancellor himself was involved in his swindling scheme. Taking what assets he could, he made his way to the crumbling colony, sensing a business opportunity in the wreckage - there were no major weapon manufacturers in the country, which ensued him a monopoly on firearm sales, as the other companies could not compete with his unscrupulous tactics.\n\nWar is profitable regardless of who is involved, and in the chaos after Teafeather's death, he made an even greater gain funding both sides in the civil war. With the strife coming to a close, he requested one final meeting with the victorious Marshall Highhill. It is anygriff's guess what occurred, but afterwards, Goldfeather found himself in charge of the war-torn nation. His rivals quietly left the country, their pockets full of Skeiron's blood money. He now leads the radically reorganised colony as one of his company's subdivisions - focused entirely on financial interest."
caesar_from_fnv_desc:0 "Reyhard Ironclaw, a colonial native, did not show interest in politics until he was given a series of books on the conquests of Grover the First. Being an avid reader, he was entranced by the books' historical content - the strength of griffons, a vast united country, a single undisputed ruler. It became clear to him that the colony's dilapidated state was the result of it lacking all these qualities. With that, he founded his reliable Falcons and has spent a great amount of time trying to convince the populace of his vision. Unfortunately, his ideas were in a minority as most griffons simply saw no need for such a drastic change of leadership, nor did they agree with his demeaning comments on ponykind.\n\nClearly, he benefited from Teafeather's demise. With the nation shattered in a brutal civil war, he opportunistically allied himself with Marshal Highhill's coup, then disposed of him once the marshal was past his usage. Ironclaw always regarded Highhill as an uninspired stooge, lacking his grand vision, one that is now set to become a reality in the reformed colony."
snooty_commie_bird_desc:0 "A well read intellectual from Federstadt, Heinrich Redtail was visiting the Equestrian region of Severyana when the uprising occurred. Due to an eventful venture, he became a friend of Steel Stallion, who he spent many nights with, discussing the merits of Markism. Being rather physically weak, he did not directly participate in the Severyan Revolution, but he helped codify some of the Revolution's tenets. He returned to his hometown afterwards, hoping to rally the impoverished proletariat into action, yet his coup did not get off the ground as he, together with his conspirators, were quickly arrested. After being released from prison, he decided to start a peaceful political party, gaining moderate popularity, yet never truly being able to challenge the colonial administration.\n\nThis changed following the events of Teafeather's death, as Redtail's party was successful in securing enough votes to claim victory in the election. With a fertile ground for the spread of socialism, he now seeks to remake Nova Griffonia in the image of his distant friend, where the workers will finally be free of exploitation."
chernobyl_beak:0 "§YBorn§!: 15th of April, 979 in Winghagen\n\n§YRank§!: Oberst\n\n§YBiography§!: Daniel Crimsonbeak was born to a Gryphussian Republican Officer and a middle class Cloudburian citizen. Being the only child, Daniel had a very happy childhood. Just like his father, he decided to apply to the officer academy and managed to graduate.\n\nIt was at this time where his political beliefs started to take shape. He considered himself a social democrat and never fully trusted President Kemerskai, arguing that the Marshal can be very easily corrupted by the power he held. Daniel never shared his beliefs with anyone. That is until one infamous day.\n\nDuring an officer party he got extremely drunk and started to insult Kemerskai, saying that the President was incompetent and that it was his stupidity which caused the 978 Revolution to fail. The morning after this unfortunate incident Daniel realised how tragic his situation was. He managed to catch a ship to Nova Griffonia and escape from certain court martial. Luckily for for him, the former colony was a safe haven for exiles. Thanks to his officer experience he got accepted into the Nova Griffonian military as a Militia Commander. He is a stout supporter of Wilhelm Silverwing and his Griffonian Social Democratic Party. He was part of the Nova Griffonian delegation during the Equestria Games of 1003 ALB.During his stay in Equestria he discussed with equestrian officers about the implementation of motorized vechicles in modern warfare.\n\nDaniel sternly considers himself Gryphussian despite being raised in Northern Griffonia. He believes that all creatures of the world are created equal – no matter the race. In his opinion Griffonia should be united once again under a democratic federation of nations, arguing that a centralized state is too vulnerable to corruption and injustice.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Scroup"

Unfortunately the assailant managed to escape before the police could respond, and without a scape-goat to blame the people turned on each other. The long standing tensions between the Communists, the Harmonists and the Fascists exploded and the streets ran red with the griffon blood.

Needless to say this did not sit well with the Council, no one is quite sure who fired the first shot, but in about ten seconds flat the city erupted into chaos once more.

Here we stand more united then ever while our former countrymen shed each others blood in the names of false prophets, and yet we allow these idiots to claim themselves the descendants of our glorious empire! An empire that once spanned continents, an empire that once had millions upon millions of people living under it's glorious banner, but now it is dead, an empire now reduced to rubble. The time has come for us to face the facts; the East is lost, but our empire can rise again... this time in the West."
 griffons.13.a:0 "The Empire lives on!"
 griffons.14.t:0 "The New Imperator"
 griffons.14.d:0 "Following his recent coup d’etat, Highhill, newly appointed Leader of Nova Griffonia, has now ordered for him to be officially crowned Emperor of the Griffons. The coronation took place inside the Grand Barracks of the capital, followed up by a speech from Highhill to his subjects and a mighty military parade. "The days of chaos and instability are over," Highhill spoke to his people. "Our nation shall be one of unison, strength and determination. It is time for us to rise up and reclaim our rightful spot on the world stage! It is time to reclaim the honour and glory of the empire!" The speech was followed up by mighty choirs of cheering griffons down in the streets of the capital.

Unsurprisingly, he and his followers would not be satisfied with the election result itself, and it was today announced that the griffons had crowned Ironclaw himself as their newest emperor. The coronation took place in an old plaza of the capital. Many hundreds of griffons arrived to see the spectacle. A marching band of over 2000 soldiers commenced the ceremony, followed up by a speech from Ironclaw himself after which he then crowned himself emperor. "Today is our day," Ironclaw said in his speech. "Today is the day we rid ourselves from the corrupt, degenerate and weak democracy that has been plaguing our beautiful country. Today we look forward eagerly. A new, bright future awaits us! Our destiny awaits us!" The griffons’ neighbours have visibly been growing nervous over these recent developments, and the world as a whole will have to look out for a stronger, united griffon folk.

 griffons.21.d:0 "Field Marshal Highhill the former military governor of Nova Griffonia and close friend of the now deceased Governor has taken to criticising the Provisional Government for their mediocre attempts at restoring order to the country, and letting radicals run wild through the streets unchecked. While not as beloved as Teafeather Highhill still has the respect and more importantly the ears of most of our military, and his criticism won't do us any favours."
 griffons.21.a:0 "As if he could do any better..."
 griffons.22.t:0 "FfIfG Soup Kitchens"
 griffons.22.d:0 "There has been some surprising news from the poorer districts of Weter today. Several members of the FfIfG and even the infamous Falcons of Griffonstone have taken it upon themselves to open several soup kitchens in an effort to feed the poor. Why they've done this can only be speculated upon, but to most it is welcome to see that even in these dark times some basic kindness can still be found in the most unexpected places."
 griffons.22.a:0 "What's next, magic Mules?"
 griffons.23.t:0 "Clashes in the Streets"
 griffons.23.d:0 "Despite the FfIfG and the PGG agreeing to cease any and all violence between each other some of their more zealous members seemingly haven't gotten the memo. As today in the middle of Weter no less, the two sides clashed causing several dozen deaths, injuring hundreds and causing hundreds of thousands of bits in damage. Needless to say this little debacle hasn't done their representatives in the Provisional Government any favours."
 griffons.23.a:0 "It's like herding cats..."
 griffons.24.t:0 "NGDF Scandal"
 griffons.24.d:0 "An interesting scandal has come up in the Provisional Government today, as it was discovered the NGDF representative has had no less than 27 affairs with creatures ranging from Bat Ponies to Dragons... needless to say the NGDF representatives were left speechless. Perhaps that is because of the sheer insanity of it all, or their fellow representative's interesting choice of lovers."
 griffons.24.a:0 "He certainly doesn't like vanilla..."
 griffons.25.t:0 "Workers Strike"
 griffons.25.d:0 "Several trade unions have utilised the chaos in the country to protest what they call "abhorrent working conditions" in our factories. Apparently they've deluded themselves into thinking that child labour is something that should be abolished, and while their message was rather nice and all we doubt anyone could have heard them over the burning buildings and gunshots ringing out through the entire country."
 griffons.25.a:0 "Children not working? What's next, hairless apes walking about?"
 griffons.26.t:0 "The Death of Nova Griffonian Democracy"
 griffons.26.d:0 "Not long ago Governor Teafeather was assassinated and a Provisional Government was formed in Weter until the country could stabilise. The goal of the government was to eventually give way to a democratic election; however it seems that such an election shall not be happening any time soon. As a day ago Field Marshal Highhill marched upon the governmental palace at the front of a column of soldiers and proceeded to dissolve the Provisional Government. Griffonia's future now rests in Highhill's claws."

 griffons.27.t:0 "Griffonian Democracy"
 griffons.27.d:0 "Not long ago Governor Teafeather was assassinated and a Provisional Government was formed in Weter until the country could stabilise.

 griffons.27.a:0 "They are free of the Old Empire's shackles."
 griffons.28.t:0 "Demands for Peace"
 griffons.28.d:0 "After months of making practically no progress in ridding the Frontier of Virgil and his bandits the support for our war has hit an all-time low. Many of our populace are demanding we withdraw and stop wasting griffon lives on a useless piece of land."
 griffons.28.a:0 "We've got no other option..."
 griffons.28.b:0 "Faithless cowards! We'll win this war or die trying!"
 griffons.281.t:0 "The Frontier Accepts Truce"
 griffons.281.d:0 "In a somewhat surprising move, the thugs leading the Frontier have decided to agree on an armistice, although there's little doubt it is a temporary one. Governor Teafeather has assured the concerned griffons that Virgil and his band will be dealt with, eventually. For now we must focus on rebuilding ourselves."
 griffons.281.a:0 "Your time will come, Virgil."
 griffons.282.t:0 "The Frontier Declines Truce"
 griffons.282.d:0 "Regrettably, the bandits and other miscreants of the Frontier have laughed off our offer of peace! Thankfully the envoy was left unharmed, but now we must fight to the bitter end against these vicious raiders... Public support for this war is already very low, so we must finish this up before our people rise up against us, or even worse, join these rebels. The general staff has drawn up plans for a new plan of attack."
 griffons.282.a:0 "I'll see your head on a pike, Virgil!"
 griffons.29.t:0 "The Frontier"
 griffons.29.d:0 "It seems that Heinrich has somehow managed to take over the Frontier. However with his original intention of bringing the revolution to Nova Griffonia becoming somewhat redundant he's decided that he wishes to re-join our nation once more."
 griffons.29.a:0 "Welcome back brother!"
 griffons.30.t:0 "Skeiron's Scheming"
 griffons.30.d:0 "Unsurprisingly to anyone whom knows him, Skeiron used his new-found power as our economic minister to seize some foreign factories, which he quickly incorporated into Talon Gunworks. While this doesn't hurt us per se; on the contrary it's rather useful, it is still a very blatant abuse of power and reflects poorly on our government."
 griffons.30.a:0 "At least warn us next time, Goldfeather."
 griffons.31.t:0 "Griffonian Migrants"
 griffons.31.d:0 "Yet another batch arrived today, fleeing Griffonia with naught but their clothes on their backs. They hope to find a better future here far from the wars of the Old Empire, and we welcome them with open wings."
 griffons.31.a:0 "Welcome to Nova Griffonia!"
 griffons.32.t:0 "Supporting Loyalists in the Equestrian Civil War"
 griffons.32.d:0 "We've received horrible news from Equestria. It seems that Princess Luna has yet again turned into Nightmare Moon. How the Equestrians didn't see this happening is anyone's guess, but most of our citizens and more importantly our advisors seem to be of the belief that should Nightmare Moon win the Civil War she will eventually set her sights on us. What shall we do?"
 griffons.32.a:0 "Send the Equestrians some guns and call it a day."
 griffons.32.b:0 "Arm some volunteers and send them to Equestria."
 griffons.32.c:0 "This really does not concern us."
 griffons.33.t:0 "Griffon Volunteers Arrive"
 griffons.33.d:0 "It seems that the griffons perhaps realising the threat that Nightmare Moon poses to the entire world have sent some volunteers to help us fight her forces."
 griffons.33.a:0 "At least it's something."
 griffons.34.t:0 "Supporting Equestria against the Changelings"
 griffons.34.d:0 "It seems that the Changelings have decided to invade Equestria, and while we don't exactly like either side, it's better to have the Equestrians at our doorstep than the Changelings. Therefore, some of our advisors have recommended that we send some assistance to the Equestrians."
 griffons.34.a:0 "Send them some equipment I'm sure they'll appreciate it."
 griffons.34.b:0 "Arm a couple of volunteer regiments and ship them off."
 griffons.34.c:0 "We've got better things to do."
 griffons.35.t:0 "Griffon Volunteers Arrive"

 griffons.50.t:0 "The Long March"
 griffons.50.d:0 "All the way from Weter, our troops marched onwards towards the northwest. As our forces reached the hills, communist guerrillas began skirmishing the exhausted troops, but all was not lost. Highhill rallied the soldiers and lead them on a counterattack which broke the spirit of the terrorists in no time. Soon enough the hills and mountains were cleansed of communist scum. Victory is ours, at least this day."
 griffons.50.a:0 "It's a long way to the Kingsmere..."
 griffons.51.t:0 "The Skirmish at Guidonuovo"
 griffons.51.d:0 "The communist-controlled town of Guidonuovo was an important center of rebellion. Here the red flag was raised first, as soon as news of the coup arrived, and the local garrison expelled after a fierce battle. It had since become a fortified bastion of socialism which would not fall easily. Highhill knew he had to be cunning to avoid a costly siege.\n\nOur troops marched through local forests during the night, hiding their advance until revealing themselves just outside the city. It was not a pleasant experience for anyone involved and a group of soldiers were even ambushed by an Ursa Major. However, it was all worth it as they emerged out of the forest at dawn, arriving from a direction which had been left completely undefended. The reds had no time to prepare and organise a response and the city was quickly taken by our brave soldiers. Once more, we have defeated these vile traitors!"
 griffons.51.a:0 "Send the prisoners to the camps!"
 griffons.52.t:0 "The Pacification of Kluv Valley"
 griffons.52.d:0 "After the coup, communist partisans joined forces with local yak insurgents in Kluv Valley, promising to recognize them as equal citizens of Nova Griffonia if they aided them. The local yak populace has long been a thorn on our side and this only proves that thorn should've been removed before it was too late.\n\nHighhill's forces first occupied the hills and mountains surrounding the valley which the rebels had foolishly left undefended. Then he brought in his artillery to rain fires of Tartarus upon the unprepared enemy. With fierce fire support, the infantry easily shattered pockets of resistance and took thousands of prisoners. Yaks, however, proved to be resilient fighters who stubbornly refused to surrender. After heavy casualties they were finally driven across the border into Jakistan."
 griffons.52.a:0 "We've got those bastards on the run!"
 griffons.53.t:0 "The Battle at the Kingsmere"
 griffons.53.d:0 "A clash between two gigantic forces, ours and that of the communists, took place on the shores of the Kingsmere lake to our northwest.\n\nWhat was initially a skirmish developed into an all-out battle, with artillery and airplanes. Griffons, both loyalist and communist, perished on the battlefield by the hundreds. Although the casualties were high, the reds were the ones to sound the retreat at the end of the day. Our fighters mowed them down without mercy as they tried to escape by running and flying."
 griffons.53.a:0 "The Kingsmere is ours!"
 griffons.54.t:0 "Up the Beak Mountains"
 griffons.54.d:0 "By using old, largely forgotten mountain paths, a small detachment of troops managed to sneak past several republican patrols. They managed to make their way into the camp of the rebels, which were defended by a small force. A shootout quickly turned into a lengthy skirmish with traior guerrillas as enemy reinforcements arrived. The mountainous terrain did not favour our troops in any way, but through sheer willpower, valiant effort and Highhill's leadership, our troops pushed ever onwards and eventually captured the camp and its supplies, which caused the rebels who were left to surrender."
 griffons.54.a:0 "It was a tough battle..."
 griffons.55.t:0 "The Battle for the North"
 griffons.55.d:0 "Our troops marched north, aiming to reclaim the frigid fjords and mountains from the traitors. It did not take long for them to engage in a series of small battles with the local resistance. The rebels pulled back before ambushing our troops once more, then pulling back again. This would repeat at least five times before the enemy finally dispersed for good, but the casualties are truly something to be mourned."
 griffons.55.a:0 "What a pain."
 griffons.56.t:0 "The Battle of Ny Winghagen"
 griffons.56.d:0 "The coastal city of Ny Winghagen, an old settlement that had always had republican sentiment, had been taken by rebel troops after Highhill's coup. They had celebrated Kemerskai's "liberation" of their old homeland decades ago and continued to advocate the establishment of a Nova Griffonian republic.\n\nThat nonsense ended today when our troops tore down the republican tricolour from the flagpole at the center of Ny Winghagen. The fighting had been some of the fiercest yet, but, after taking many casualties during the urban fighting in the city, the troops managed to secure each building. The democratic rebels who remained alive were scattered into a retreat.\n\nWhile this is a great victory, it foreshadows the fighting soon to occur in the city of Nouvelle Aquila, not far from Ny Winghagen."
 griffons.56.a:0 "We're almost there..."
 griffons.57.t:0 "The Battle for Nouvelle Aquila"
 griffons.57.d:0 "It was a bloodbath, indeed.\n\nThe republican defences in and around Nouvelle Aquila were a deadly obstacle. The city itself was the capital of the NGDF, who saw it as the Nova Griffonian beacon of democracy. After the counter-revolution in Aquileia many years ago, the King had exiled thousands of republicans here, and they had not abandoned their pathetic ideology since. Many of them saw the current unrest as an opportunity to redeem themselves by overthrowing the government and establishing a republic, like they had done in 980.\n\nArtillery howled in the deep of the night, shelling enemy foxholes and barricades in the suburbs. Then, shortly after, the first assault battalions engaged. Machine guns sang and rifles barked. The occasional muzzle flash from the enemy's guns was all the soldiers could aim for during those late hours. And although the casualties were greater than expected, our troops overran the outer defences.\n\nLater, at sunrise, a renewed barrage of high-explosive shells bombarded the city itself. Windows shattered, roofs caved in, fires took hold of a quarter of the city. The rebel troops, discouraged by this, held on by a thread. By the time our troops engaged them in close-quarters combat, even melee combat in some cases. Though their resistance was fierce, they were soon made to surrender.\n\nThe day is ours, and the voice of democracy has been silenced for good."
 griffons.57.a:0 "A costly victory."
 griffons.58.t:0 "The End of the Civil War"
 griffons.58.d:0 "After many months, and plenty of skirmishes and battles, we have come out on top and defeated those who wished to depose our rightful government. We have restored order and justice in Nova Griffonia, and it is now time to march onwards! A new government will be formed under the watchful eye of Erwin Highhill, the hero of the conflict. He will ensure it will be a strong and united one, free from deviant and destabilising communism and democracy. However, Reyhard Ironclaw proved himself to be a charismatic and fierce leader during the fighting, gaining popular support in the process and swelling the ranks of his party. None can also deny that Skeiron Goldfeather's industries fueled the war effort and enabled us to gain victory. Now there are whispers that Ironclaw is planning to seize power and Skeiron seeks to bribe Highhill and become the leader of a truly free Nova Griffonia. Whatever the case, a new government must be organized soon, lest Nova Griffonia falls into chaos again."
 griffons.58.a:0 "Let none question our rule!"
 griffons.59.t:0 "The Falcons Dispersed"
 griffons.59.d:0 "The FfIfG, or Party of Griffon Interests, is a relatively well-known radical movement, which aims to further only griffon interests while abandoning other species entirely, and leaving behind the weak-minded and weak-bodied.\n\nAdditionally, this party has long had a unofficial paramilitary wing: The Falcons of Griffonstone. Though they are in the service of the party, many see them as nothing but thugs, thiefs and simple criminals. We must make it clear that we do not allow these types of movements in our nation, anymore. Their organisation must be banned at once, and the members prosecuted accordingly."
 griffons.59.a:0 "I never liked those bastards anyway."
 griffons.60.t:0 "The Wildcard"
 griffons.60.d:0 "The Civil war has ended, but the nation is still undecided on what to do now. Erwin Highhill appears as the obvious answer, having lead us through the civil war, though also having caused the civil war in the first place. Reyhard Ironclaw of the FfIfG is also very keen on seizing power himself, in order to establish a totalitarian state.\n\nSkeiron Goldfeather, the richest Griffon in Nova Griffonia and the leading economic advisor, can only laugh at these two. He knows that true power doesn't come from controlling the citizens of the state, and enforcing ridiculous laws and regulations, but rather the opposite. Goldfeather knows that money is the only thing that can make any Griffon happy, and that with enough money in one's pockets, you could achieve just about anything.\n\nAfter a few backdoor talks, and a very, very generous donation, Highhill has dissolved the military junta, and has declared Skeiron Goldfeather as the new head of state. The nation now awaits what Goldfeather, a rather unknown dark figure to many, has planned."
 griffons.60.a:0 "We're open for business!"
 griffons.61.t:0 "The March of the Falcons"
 griffons.61.d:0 "Today was the day. When the Civil War ended, Reyhard Ironclaw and all party members of the FfIfG knew that this was their only shot at seizing power, when Highhill was weakest.\n\nThe Falcons of Griffonstone, the infamous militant wing of the FfIfG, gathered outside Weter today, and with Ironclaw leading them, they marched onwards. The City's inhabitants were stunned. The local police could do nothing against this march with their few numbers, and many officers fled the city in fear.\n\nIn the end, Ironclaw and his lackies seized power and arrested Highhill. A new Order shall rise, under a new leadership."

"The days of chaos and instability are over," Highhill spoke to his people. "Our nation shall be one of unison, strength and determination. It is time for us to rise up and reclaim our rightful spot on the world stage! It is time to reclaim the honour and glory of the empire!" The speech was followed up by mighty choirs of cheering griffons down in the streets of the capital.

The diplomats speak of offering our nation the chance to join the Northern Bloc, a democratic union which promotes the basic rights of every individual. They mention a wide variety of plans, plans such as collaborative technological pursuits, an industrial development initiative, and several military drills that can be planned and implemented in the future.\n\nDo we accept, or do we decline?

 griffons.45.d:0 "In a great achievement for our colony our troops have forced out the Equestrians stationed in the State Up North. While the fleeing Equestrian transport ships sailed over the horizon our troops moved into the Village Up North, the townsfolk looking on in fear as the engines of the Nova Griffonian war machine rolled past. To alleviate their concerns many pony troops were given leave to talk up how much better life is under our flag than that of the warring Equestrians, and by the end of the day at least some of the populace have decided to give our government a shot. It is unknown how the proposed plan to rename the city will affect this, but at the moment it is still only a proposal."

 griffons.46.t:0 "Ponies Beat Back Our Bid"
 griffons.46.d:0 "For many years the populace of [Root.GetName] considered the Equestrian city rather precisely named Village Up North to be rightfully part of their territory. Unfortunately, our hopes to use the recent civil war in Equestria to take control of this territory has failed. After a long and brutal border battle the Equestrian contingent in the State Up North was able to hold on long enough for the general in command to break off the attack in accordance with the previously agreed upon plan.

Units from the Equestrian military intercepted them, but while the battle raged for several hours at the end of the day casualties were minor and the outcome indecisive. It looks like the current state of affairs will remain the same up north, which is good news for Equestria and allows them to focus more of their attention on their ongoing civil war."
 griffons.47.a:0 "The more things change, the more they stay the same."

 griffons.48.d:0 "In a small bright spot in a sea of sorrow, our troops in the northernmost part of the nation have held back an attack by griffon troops who attempted to seize the city of Village Up North. The commander in charge has been sighted for heroism, and so have several soldiers under his command. In this time when everything seems to be falling apart this news shall surely boost morale."
 griffons.48.a:0 "Heroes, one and all."

 griffons.49.t:0 "Northernmost Point Captured by Griffonians"
 griffons.49.d:0 "In one more shameful event among many shameful events of late, the Village Up North, once famous for being the northernmost point of the nation, was seized by griffon troops following an intense border skirmish that left many on both sides dead. The local commander felt that his position would soon be overrun, and so ordered all troops to evacuate the state. He justified his position by stating that his supplies were threatened with being cut off, and that his troops could be put to far better use on the mainland."
 griffons.49.a:0 "Another landmark lost to the flames of war."

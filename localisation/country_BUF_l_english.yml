BUF_warrior_path_desc:0 "Long ago, buffalo warriors were feared by ponies across the South. When ponies came, they came deferentially, and they gave us respect. Now they steal our land and resources and laugh at our backwardness. How much longer will we endure this shame? Our ancestors were warriors, not cowards, and even when at peace they were feared! After years of humiliation, we will show the world the buffalo still have fire in our blood!"
BUF_proclaim_the_new_empire:0 "Proclaim the New Empire"
BUF_proclaim_the_new_empire_desc:0 "We have gathered a great army, and we stand poised to take back all the South. Strongheart pleads with us not to spill blood, and Thunderhooves is also hesitant about this plan.

bufstate.2.t:0 "Equestria Chooses War"
bufstate.2.d:0 "Our worst fears are confirmed, as it seems that the treacherous government of [EQS.GetName] has decided to attack us without provocation. We shall teach those ponies how buffalo fight!"
bufstate.2.a:0 "We will defend our land to the last!"
bufstate.3.t:0 "Equestria Split Asunder"
bufstate.3.d:0 "One of the pony princesses has declared war on another! As the massive nation of [EQS.GetName] is sliced in half by the emergence of [NLR.GetName], we have a unique opportunity. We could seize the lands to the southeast, connecting the [BUF.GetName] with the ocean for the first time in many years. This course of action is popular among both unionists and The Elder, and the ponies have informed us they would welcome us with open hooves. Or we could choose to keep our borders as they are, and not upsetting [EQS.GetName]. What will we do?"
bufstate.3.a:0 "We shouldn't pass up the chance to retake ancestral lands!"
bufstate.3.b:0 "We can't afford to upset Equestria. They might see this as an act of aggression."
bufstate.5.t:0 "Integration into Equestria"
bufstate.5.d:0 "For many years now the Buffalo State was surrounded by Equestrian territories and it is impossible to say that the buffaloes are independent nor is their state a self-sufficient one. Equestrian officials and [equestria.GetLeader] personally offers the Buffalo chiefs integrate their chiefdom into the Equestria. All of the buffalo will be granted with Equestrian citizenship. Equestria promises to invest some of its riches into development of the buffalo state and, generally, being a part of Equestria will positively affect the economic situation of our state."
bufstate.5.a:0 "Let them annex us."
bufstate.5.b:0 "Let them puppet us."
bufstate.5.c:0 "They won't get anything."
bufstate.6.t:0 "Technology Import"

bufstate.6.seventy:0 "Most of we have."
bufstate.6.fifty:0 "Half of our riches."
bufstate.6.thirty:0 "Thirty percent."

bufstate.9.t_small_traders:0 "Equestrian Traders"

bufstate.9.t_establishing_production:0 "Equestrian Companies"
bufstate.9.d_establishing_production:0 "More and more of Equestrian traders are moving into our land. They're establishing their companies and businesses, they don't pay the buffaloes as much as they pay the pony workers. The buffaloes are becoming the source of cheap labour for them. Our young fragile enterprises cannot compete with the experienced and advanced pony businesses. This does not help us as an independent nation and if we don't intervene, the situation will only get worse."
bufstate.9.t_oil_companies_n_factories:0 "Corporations and Oil Companies"
bufstate.9.d_oil_companies_n_factories:0 "As it has been discovered that our land contains a lot of natural resources, namely oil, larger Equestrian corporations are starting to move in and organising oil extraction companies. Due to lack of regulation they have established their monopoly all over [BUF.GetNameDef] and with insufficient support from the government the local companies are crushed."
bufstate.9.a:0 "Not good."
bufstate.10.t:0 "Equestrian Corporations"
bufstate.10.d:0 "As a continuation of our free market policies, we've opened our borders for Equestrian corporations to come and do business in our land freely."
bufstate.10.a:0 "Was that a good idea?"
bufstate.11.t:0 "Force Market Regulations"
bufstate.11.d:0 "Our nations has suffered enough from the greedy monopolists. Several new laws have been enacted on the last chief council. The monopolies will be rooted out and the companies who disobey the new laws will be expelled from our country."
bufstate.11.a:0 "Yes."
bufstate.12.t:0 "Buffalo Region?"
bufstate.12.d:0 "The chiefs have decided: For the betterment of the buffalo society, [BUF.GetNameDef] needs to become a part of Equestria, to open its borders and accept pony friendship. Let their princess guide us now.\n\n To what extent will we integrate?"

Many other chiefs are in attendance, and the council will decide who shall lead. \n\n The Elder is an old buffalo who wishes to regain the ancestral lands of our people. \n\n Chief Thunderhooves is the current ruler, and favors a middle-of-the-road approach. After a pie conflict with the ponies of Appleloosa, Thunderhooves signed an accord with the ponies. \n\n Chieftess Strongheart is the youngest leader, and has a vision of cooperation between the buffalo and the ponies. She believes that the best path to progress is through friendship."
bufstate.15.a:0 "Let's hear them out."
bufstate.16.t:0 "Elder Greyhorn Speaks"
bufstate.16.d:0 "The wizened former chief gazes across the fire at Strongheart and Thunderhooves. He bows his head solemnly, and begins.\n\n"Listen to me, my friends. I wish only well to the buffalo people. And I want all the problems of the buffalo people to disappear at once. And the main problem that we have is, of course, the ponies. They are invading our land, taking over our pastures, growing their pathetic apple trees on our land! Chiefs, the buffalo have had enough of it, let us drive them away from here!""
bufstate.16.a:0 "What do you say?"
bufstate.16.b:0 "He's right, you know."
bufstate.17.t:0 "Chief Thunderhooves Speaks"
bufstate.17.d:0 "Thunderhooves taps his hoof against the ground, deep in thought.\n\n"Thank you, Elder Greyhorn. The Elder has some good points. However, the most reasonable option for us is to not change anything. The life of ours goes well, we can still race through the pastures as we always did. The ponies give us pies in exchange, and they are very good! We shouldn't endanger our way of life again by trying to change things.""
bufstate.17.a:0 "Right."
bufstate.18.t:0 "Chieftess Strongheart Speaks"
bufstate.18.d:0 "The young chieftess shakes her head, a frown upon her face.\n\n"I understand your point, Father, Elder Greyhorn. But I don't agree with you. The way you speak about ponies frightens me; they are our friends, not our enemies! We need to work with them closer, side by side. There are so many things that they can teach us. If we continue to hate them, or ignore them, the buffalo people will be outclassed by any standard by all other developed nations.""

bufstate.20.d_thunderhooves:0 "The wise chief who ruled the buffaloes for more than a decade, Chief Thunderhooves, was elected by the Chief Council again. He does not like ponies very much, but he doesn't hate them, and since the ponies agreed to share pies with the buffalo, his heart has softened. Hence, most likely, the political course of the [BUF.GetName] will not noticeably change."
bufstate.20.d_greyhorn:0 "Elder Greyhorn was elected by the Chief Council today. He ruled over the [BUF.GetName] before Thunderhooves and before Appleloosian ponies started expanding their orchards. He has been angered by the ponies' behaviour for many years, and after years of buffalo lands shrinking, he has come to hate them. The relationship between [EQS.GetName] and [BUF.GetName] may worsen now that he has taken the lead. However, the decisions of the Council of Chiefs are final."

### EVENT FOR CHANGELINGS ###
bufstate.29.t:0 "The Buffalo Offer their Loyalty"
bufstate.29.d:0 "Chrysalis stared down at the letter in disbelief. Stamped with a flag she'd never seen before, the letter claimed to be an official diplomatic message. She rolled her eyes, and sliced it open with a flick of magic.\n\n"To the most esteemed Queen Chrysalis," it began, "After much deliberation, I have decided to write to you formally. With Equestria becoming more and more openminded about war, I fear for the survival of our tribes as a nation. Thus, I turn to you. In return for your protection, the buffalo will give you our allegiance. We will be able to open a second front, diverting pony troops from your lines. Although we may not be strong, the distraction would surely be valuable to your great army, and should they choose to ignore us we can cut them off from valuable resources."\n\nChrysalis rubbed her eyes. The BUFFALO of all nations wanted to serve her? She'd always considered them completely irrelevant, merely a part of Equestria those foolish princesses hadn't seen fit to seize, but apparently they were up to their own conquests.\n\n"We do, of course, have our own reasons for seeking an alliance. Long ago, the buffalo roamed free across much of the South. Generations of settlers have pushed us back, driving us out of our own land. Retaking and holding our rightful territory has been my lifelong goal. I'm sure you understand how that feels, Your Majesty. We believe that with your assistance and guidance, we can forge a better future for our people."\n\n"With my humblest regards, Elder Greyhorn"\n\nShe pondered this unexpected offer. Certainly, an attack from the south would slice Equestria's troops in half, and if the buffalo already controlled ports the Heer wouldn't have to deal with the headache of an amphibious invasion. New subjects were always welcome, and there was something deliciously ironic about punishing Equestria for their softheartedness on the buffalo question. Nonetheless, she could always refuse and take it by force."
bufstate.29.a:0 "I never turn away willing subjects!"
bufstate.29.b:0 "I have... other plans for the region."
bufstate.30.t:0 "The Buffalo Protectorate"
bufstate.30.d:0 "As Equestria grows ever more militaristic, we have no other option but to voluntarily yield to Queen Chrysalis. She will no doubt aid us in retaking our rightful land, and ensure that the ponies will never again steal what is ours from us. By cooperating with her, we'll be able to do what we never could alone."
bufstate.30.a:0 "We kneel before you, Your Majesty."
bufstate.31.t:0 "The Meeting of the New Council"
bufstate.31.d:0 "Instead of the old chiefs, younger representatives from every buffalo province were called to participate in the new council. Together, the youth of the nation will decide what course the Buffalo State should take in order to advance into the future."

bufstate.33.t:0 "Gentle Giant Speaks"
bufstate.33.d:0 "The other less known buffalo communist theorist, Gentle Giant, says that such a transition is not possible and that in order to establish a socialist state, you ought to have fully developed capitalist economic relations."

### General desc
BUF_OC_general_desc:0 "Flash Flood, or as he's better known amongst his tribe, Angry Gorge after Mighty Storm, was raised the traditional way of the Buffalo, back before the ponies ever encroached on their land, before industry and technology found its way south. Like his ancestors before him, and their ancestors before them, and so forth, he learned to live off the land, to forage, to fight against other tribes to support his brethren. Many things have changed since the ponies brought with them the many problems of a modern society, and the Buffalo have had to change as well. Flash Flood simply wishes to protect his own, and recognizes that the Buffalo must change to survive, however, he will never forget who he is, or where he came from. No matter what, he will serve his kind to ensure that the Buffalo will stampede on."

### EVENTS #################################
###########################################
 bufstate.1.t:0 "Equestria's friendship"
 bufstate.1.d:0 "An official envoy was sent to our chiefs from Equestria. They offer their friendship and want to resolve all of the past misunderstandings. Sheriff Silverstar did not attend the procession, however. Can we trust the ponies?"
 bufstate.1.a:0 "Their intentions are genuine."
 bufstate.1.b:0 "Never trust a pony."
bufstate.2.t:0 "Equestria Chooses War"
bufstate.2.d:0 "Our worst fears are confirmed, as it seems that the treacherous government of [EQS.GetName] has decided to attack us without provocation. We shall teach those ponies how buffalo fight!"
bufstate.2.a:0 "We will defend our land to the last!"
bufstate.5.t:0 "Integration into Equestria"
bufstate.5.d:0 "For many years now the Buffalo State was surrounded by Equestrian territories and it is impossible to say that the buffaloes are independent nor is their state a self-sufficient one. Equestrian officials and Princess Celestia personally offers the Buffalo chiefs integrate their chiefdom into the Equestria. All of the buffalo will be granted with Equestrian citizenship. Equestria promises to invest some of its riches into development of the buffalo state and, generally, being a part of Equestria will positively affect the economic situation of our state."
bufstate.5.a:0 "Let them annex us."
bufstate.5.b:0 "Let them puppet us."
bufstate.5.c:0 "They won't get anything."
bufstate.6.t:0 "Technology Import"
bufstate.6.d:0 "We're about to send our agents to Equestria to purchase latest machine tools and inspect newest methods of manufacturing. How much should we invest in this enterprise?"
bufstate.6.ninety:0 "All we can."
bufstate.6.seventy:0 "Most of we have."
bufstate.6.fifty:0 "Half of our riches."
bufstate.6.thirty:0 "Thirty percent."
bufstate.6.ten:0 "Not that much."
bufstate.7.t:0 "Duration"
bufstate.7.d:0 "For how long do we want to invest into purchasing technology from outside?"
bufstate.7.three_years:0 "Three years."
bufstate.7.two_years:0 "Two years."
bufstate.7.one_year:0 "One year."
bufstate.7.twohundred_days:0 "200 Days."

bufstate.8.t:0 "The Chief Spoke: Invite Traders"
bufstate.8.d:0 "To improve our economic situation the chiefs have decided to open our borders for Equestrian traders. Many buffaloes do not like the idea, especially the elders. But the decision is made. We will see what will come out of it."
bufstate.8.a:0 "Fine."

bufstate.9.t_small_traders:0 "Equestrian Traders"
bufstate.9.d_small_traders:0 "Equestrian traders are importing more and more goods into our lands. Modern industrial tools, too. There aren't that many of them. However, there are some concerns about the future of our economics."
bufstate.9.t_establishing_production:0 "Equestrian Companies"
bufstate.9.d_establishing_production:0 "More and more of Equestrian traders are moving into our land. They're establishing their companies and businesses, they don't pay the buffaloes as much as they pay the pony workers. The buffaloes are becoming the source of cheap labour for them. Our young fragile enterprises cannot compete with the experienced and advanced pony businesses. This does not help us as an independent nation and if we don't intervene, the situation will only get worse."
bufstate.9.t_oil_companies_n_factories:0 "Corporations and Oil Companies"
bufstate.9.d_oil_companies_n_factories:0 "As it has been discovered that our land contains a lot of natural resources, namely oil, larger Equestrian corporations are starting to move in and organising oil extraction companies. Due to lack of regulation they have established their monopoly all over [BUF.GetNameDef] and with insufficient support from the government the local companies are crushed."
bufstate.9.a:0 "Not good."
bufstate.10.t:0 "Equestrian Corporations"
bufstate.10.d:0 "As a continuation of our free market policies, we've opened our borders for Equestrian corporations to come and do business in our land freely."
bufstate.10.a:0 "Was that a good idea?"
bufstate.11.t:0 "Force Market Regulations"
bufstate.11.d:0 "Our nations has suffered enough from the greedy monopolists. Several new laws have been enacted on the last chief council. The monopolies will be rooted out and the companies who disobey the new laws will be expelled from our country."
bufstate.11.a:0 "Yes."
bufstate.12.t:0 "Buffalo Region?"
bufstate.12.d:0 "The chiefs have decided: For the betterment of the buffalo society, [BUF.GetName] needs to become a part of Equestria, to open its borders and accept pony's friendship. Let their princess guide us now."
bufstate.12.a:0 "Full integration."
bufstate.12.b:0 "Autonomous Region."
bufstate.13.t:0 "Ponies Protest Against Regulations"
bufstate.13.d:0 "Several larger corporations have agitated their workers to strike against the regulations imposed by our government. They may disagree, but the regulations are essential to protect our fragile economy and our people from becoming slaves of the monopolies. What shall we do with the strikers?"
bufstate.13.a:0 "Let them be."
bufstate.13.b:0 "Pay them."
bufstate.14.t:0 "The Strikes Continue"
bufstate.14.d:0 "The strikes have continued for weeks, yet the workers, bribed by the companies, do not want to stop their routine of standing with posters in the centres of our villages. The chiefs have decided to send a formal appeal to Princess Celestia to stop this affair."
bufstate.14.a:0 "We'll solve this alone."
bufstate.14.b:0 "Princess Celestia will calm them down."
bufstate.15.t:0 "The Chief Council"
bufstate.15.d:0 "Is taking Place"
bufstate.15.a:0 "Let's hear them out."
bufstate.16.t:0 "Elder Greyhorn Speaks"
bufstate.16.d:0 "- Listen to me, my friends. I wish only well to the buffalo people. And I want all the problems of the buffalo people to disappear at once. And the main problem that we have is, of course, the ponies. They are invading our land, taking over our pastures, grow their pathetic apple trees. Chiefs, the buffalo had enough of it, let us drive them away from here!"
bufstate.16.a:0 "What do you say?"
bufstate.16.b:0 "He's right, you know."
bufstate.17.t:0 "Chief Thunderhooves Speaks"
bufstate.17.d:0 "- Thank you, Elder Greyhorn. The Elder here has some good points. However, the most reasonable option for us is to not change anything. The life of ours goes well, we can still race through the pastures as we always did. The ponies give us pies in exchange, they are very good!"
bufstate.17.a:0 "Right."
bufstate.18.t:0 "Chieftess Strongheart Speaks"
bufstate.18.d:0 "- I understand your point, Father, Elder Greyhorn. But I don't agree with you. The way you speak about ponies frightens me, they are our friends! We need to work with them closer, side by side. There are so many things that they can teach us. If we continue to hate them, or ignore them, the buffalo people will be outclassed by all standards by all other developed nations."
bufstate.18.a:0 "She has a point."
bufstate.19.t:0 "The Elected Chief"
bufstate.19.d:0 "Let us elect the new chief then."
bufstate.19.a:0 "Support the Elder."
bufstate.19.b:0 "Support Thunderhooves."
bufstate.19.c:0 "Support Strongheart."
bufstate.21.t_not_settled:0 "Princess Celestia turns us away"
bufstate.21.t_settled:0 "Princess Celestia comes to our aid"
bufstate.21.d_not_settled:0 "Princess Celestia did not respond to our request to tame the Equestrian companies."
bufstate.21.d_settled:0 "Princess Celestia responded to our request to tame the Equestrian companies and their striking workers. Situation stabilises."
bufstate.21.a:0 "Harmony, right?"
bufstate.21.b:0 "Pony Princess is a wise princess."

bufstate.20.t_strongheart:0 "Strongheart is the choice of the chiefs"
bufstate.20.t_thunderhooves:0 "The chiefs elect Thunderhooves."
bufstate.20.t_greyhorn:0 "Elder Greyhorn is elected by the chiefs"
bufstate.20.d_strongheart:0 "The young daughter of Chief Thunderhoooves, Strongheart, was elected by the Chief Council today. With her Equestria-philic sentiment, she will surely bring peace and harmony to [BUF.GetNameDef]. It is time for the younger generation to break the stagnation move forward to modernisation of the country."
bufstate.20.d_thunderhooves:0 "The one who ruled the buffaloes for more than a decade, Chief Thunderhooves, was elected by the Chief Council again. He does not like ponies very much, however, he doesn't hate them. Hence, most likely, the political course of [BUF.GetNameDef] will not noticeably change."
bufstate.20.d_greyhorn:0 "Elder Greyhorn was elected by the Chief Council today. He ruled over [BUF.GetNameDef] before Thunderhooves and before Appleloosian ponies started expanding their orchards. He is angered by the ponies behaviour and one can say at this point, that he hates them. The relationship between [EQS.GetName] and [BUF.GetName] may worsen if he takes the lead. However, you cannot argue with the Council of Chiefs."
bufstate.20.strongheart:0 "The future is now!"
bufstate.20.thunderhooves:0 "We are content with what we have."
bufstate.20.greyhorn:0 "Buffaloes, rise again!"
bufstate.28.t:0 "Nationalise the Corporations"
bufstate.28.d:0 "Today, the leader of the communist opposition, Gorick, made a public speech in the centre of the village. The speech attracted many buffaloes and many of them left the rally feeling convinced in that the Equestrian corporations need to be dealt with the hard way. That the greedy pony companies need to be tamed and the economics of the nation need to be controlled by the state apparatus."
bufstate.28.a:0 "Yes!"
bufstate.22.t:0 "Expel the Traders"
bufstate.22.d:0 "By the public demand, the majority of the Equestrian traders have been sent out of the buffalo state. Will the communists stop on this?"
bufstate.22.a:0 "Right."
bufstate.23.t:0 "Gorick Agitates the Crowd"
bufstate.23.d:0 "The leader of the Buffalo National Party, Gorick, agitated the crowd to take up arms against the current establishment to take over the Buffalo State into the hooves of the every free buffalo out there. They question the authority of chief council and demand all the power to transferred to the Buffalo National Party."
bufstate.23.a:0 "Accept the term."
bufstate.23.b:0 "No revolutions here!"
bufstate.24.t:0 "Creation of the New Empire"
bufstate.24.d:0 "We've taken all of the lands that we were interested in, we can at last create the Buffalo Empire. Shall we send a peace offer to our enemies?"
bufstate.24.a:0 "Make Peace."
bufstate.24.b:0 "Continue fighting."
bufstate.25.t:0 "[BUF.GetNameDef] Offers Peace"
bufstate.25.d:0 "[BUF.GetNameDef] offers to make peace with us on terms of them taking the whole southern region and establishing their empire there."
bufstate.25.a:0 "Make Peace."
bufstate.25.b:0 "Continue fighting."
bufstate.26.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] Does Not Accept Our Peace"
bufstate.26.d:0 ""
bufstate.26.a:0 "Terrible mistake."
bufstate.27.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] Accepts Peace"
bufstate.27.d:0 ""
bufstate.27.a:0 "Great."
### EVENT FOR CHANGELINGS ###
bufstate.29.t:0 "[BUF.GetNameDef] - Changeling Commissariat"
bufstate.29.d:0 "[BUF.GetLeader] officially appealed to [CHN.GetLeader], asking for their nation to become a changeling protectorate and help our nation with everything they can."
bufstate.29.a:0 "You just can't say no."
bufstate.29.b:0 "We have other plans."
bufstate.30.t:0 "The Buffalo Commissariat"
bufstate.30.d:0 ""
bufstate.30.a:0 "Submit to Changelings."
bufstate.30.b:0 "No, we can't do that."
bufstate.31.t:0 "The Meeting of the New Council"
bufstate.31.d:0 "Instead of the old chiefs, younger representatives from every buffalo province were called to participate in the new council that would decide to what course it is better for the Buffalo State to take in order to advance into the future."
bufstate.31.a:0 "Okay, let's see."
socdem_elected:0 "Gentle Giant was elected."
gorick_elected:0 "Gorick was elected."
bufstate.32.t:0 "Gorick Speaks"
bufstate.32.d:0 "The leader of the revolt against the Equestrian corporations, Gorick, thinks our state should follow the example of Stalliongrad, avoid the rise of capitalist economics in our country and transform it directly into a socialist state."
bufstate.32.a:0 "Okay."
bufstate.33.t:0 "Gentle Giant Speaks"
bufstate.33.d:0 "The other less known buffalo communist theorist, Gentle Giant, says that such a transition is not possible and that in order to establish a socialist state, you ought to have fully developed capitalist economic relations."
bufstate.33.a:0 "Okay."
bufstate.34.t:0 "Time to Choose"
bufstate.34.d:0 "Both speakers gave a speech on their ideas. Now the representatives shall elect the leader."
bufstate.34.a:0 "Support Gentle Giant."
bufstate.34.b:0 "Support Gorick."
bufstate.39.t:0 "Caught off-guard"
bufstate.39.d:0 "Chief Council is being held again. What political path shall we stand by?"
bufstate.39.a:0 "Support harmony."
bufstate.39.b:0 "Time to fight for our land."
bufstate.38.t:0 "Chief Greyhorn and Chief Thunderhooves"
bufstate.38.d:0 "Chief Greyhorn wants to attack Equestria and retake the lands of the buffalo. Chief Thunderhooves wants to wait for a better moment to strike. Some say that appleloosian ponies may rise against Equestrian government."
bufstate.38.a:0 "We attack."
bufstate.38.b:0 "We wait."
buf_open_greyhorn_root:0 "Open the political branch of Greyhorn.\n"
buf_open_thunderhooves_root:0 "Open the political branch of Thunderhooves.\n"

bufstate.41.t:0 "Support against [SCS.GetNameDef]"
bufstate.41.d:0 "It is unlikely we will be able to beat the confederates alone, we have to a send an appeal to Equestria to help us."
bufstate.41.a:0 "Yes."

bufstate.43.t:0 "Form the Southern Union?"
bufstate.43.d:0 "With the glorious forces of the revolution having seized large swathes of territory in the southern regions of Equestria, it has become clear that we can become something greater. A proposal for a southern union has officially been presented to the government, we would have to be at peace first though."
bufstate.43.a:0 "Send a peace offer to [EQS.GetName]."
bufstate.43.b:0 "Form the Southern Union!"

bufstate.45.b:0 "Establish the route, help them with support equipment."

bufstate.47.d:0 "Trade route established."
bufstate.47.a:0 "Great."

bufstate.51.t:0 "Appleloosian Raid Successful!"

### General desc
BUF_OC_general_desc:0 "Flash Flood, or as he’s better known amongst his tribe, Angry Gorge after Mighty Storm, was raised the traditional way of the Buffalo, back before the ponies ever encroached on their land, before industry and technology found its way south. Like his ancestors before him, and their ancestors before them, and so forth, he learned to live off the land, to forage, to fight against other tribes to support his brethren. Many things have changed since the ponies brought with them the many problems of a modern society, and the Buffalo have had to change as well. Flash Flood simply wishes to protect his own, and recognizes that the Buffalo must change to survive, however, he will never forget who he is, or where he came from. No matter what, he will serve his kind to ensure that the Buffalo will stampede on."

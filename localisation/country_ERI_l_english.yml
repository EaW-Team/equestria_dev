#### FOCUS

ERI_enforce_levy:0 "Serve Your Duke"
ERI_enforce_levy_desc:0 "Slugs! Worms! The time has come again to throw our great might against that perpetual thorn in my side, Iovinus. As per their obligations, the peasants must be rallied to the cause, armed and equipped to the fullest. They shall support our knights in a glorious charge, and there better be no talk about rights again."
ERI_emergency_conversion:0 "Emergency Production Expansion"
ERI_emergency_conversion_desc:0 "Firearms! Ordnance! Shovels! The soldiers of House Erie always require more equipment for the war effort. Several non-vital production centres will have to be forcibly converted to fulfill these requests, and the Duke will tolerate no delays in the matter."
ERI_up_the_taxes:0 "Increase Noble Obligations"
ERI_up_the_taxes_desc:0 "The Duke isn't one for two-faced behaviour, which is why the nobles sworn to his banner should contribute further for his future great victory. Increased taxes, length of field service and required griffonpower drawn from their ranks are required if we are to claim Verenia in the Duke's name."
ERI_fund_fabrice:0 "Invest In Research"
ERI_fund_fabrice_desc:0 "Fabrice Assaultine, the Duke's Grand Inventor, is a griffon of brilliant thoughts, and he has provided us a great plenty in new technologies and reverse-engineered foreign designs. Surely, we should invest a portion of our yearly income to his private business, so that we may further benefit from his breakthroughs?"
ERI_fund_livio:0 "Expand Information Network"
ERI_fund_livio_desc:0 "Livio Sillègue, although despises by many for his deceptive methods, has been invaluable in unconvering numerous plots from House Eyrie. If it weren't for his eyes and ears, we wouldn't have been prepared for numerous feints and ambushes. If his activities received more coin, then we could count on clearer information in the future."
ERI_mobilise_economy:0 "Necessary Sacrifices"
ERI_mobilise_economy_desc:0 "Nogriff is pleased to do it, but the honest truth is that we must be more conservative with our already limited resources. As much as possible should be diverted towards supporting the war effort, with the knowledge of our complete control of Verenia being our guiding light and motivation for enduring this hardship. One day, it will all be worth it."
ERI_noble_oaths:0 "Rally The Bannergriffs"
ERI_noble_oaths_desc:0 ""
ERI_approve_plan:0 "Knight-Commander's Plan"
ERI_approve_plan_desc:0 "We haven't fought a war for decades without learning anything. The Duke's esteemed brother, Cyrille, Comté d'Pont-aux-Griffes has been working hard in working out a viable strategy that will allow us to break through the notoriously entrenched riverbank. There are no large scale fortifications owing to a lack of resources, yet the land is intensely difficult to advance through."
ERI_die_iovinus:0 "To End My Sibling"
ERI_die_iovinus_desc:0 "The time is now! This is our moment of triumph! We shall march across the river and put an end to Iovinus' feeble schemes. Onwards to victory and glory, for the Duke! For Verenia!"

#### DECISIONS & DECISION CATEGORIES

#### IDEAS & ADVISORS & DESIGN COMPANIES

E_E_rivalry_erie:0 "War Of Two Houses"
E_E_rivalry_erie_desc:0 "§RTwo households, both alike in dignity,\nFrom ancient grudge break to new mutiny,\nWhere civil blood makes civil claws unclean.§!\n§W--------------§!\nThe bitter feud between the rival houses of Eyrie and Erie - both houses as irreconcilable to each other as the Sun and Moon, Day and Night - has led to decades of incessant internecine violence between the two heavily militarised houses. Both leaders of the houses claim to be the rightful and legitimate Dukes of Verenia, and both of them refuse to negotiate with each other. The violence will likely continue until one side proves triumphant."
hardcore_feudalism:0 "Entrenched Feudal Relations"
hardcore_feudalism_desc:0 "Even as revolutions and change swept across Griffonia, the rulers of Verenia have been extremely reactionary in clamping down on the evils of republicanism and democracy. Technological progress is encouraged solely on the condition that it does not interfere with the established social order, leading to the region being perceived as backwards compared to their neighbours."
not_our_war:0 "Clamour For Peace"
not_our_war_desc:0 "The war for Verenia has dragged on for a seemingly indefinite amount of time, even after many conflicts in surrounding regions ceased. As a result, the growing middle class and the landed peasantry are extremely hesitant to fight in the service of what they perceive to be an uncaring ruler, wishing nothing more than a return to normalcy and peace. Replenishment and recruitment of new regiments is quite difficult as a result, and the only reliable units are ones on the Duke's personal paycheck."

ERI_knight_commander:0 "Absolon Cyrille d'Amphitre"
ERI_knight_commander_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 30th of April, 959 in Verenia\n§YRank§!: Chevalier-Commandant de la Maison Erie\n\n§YBiography§!: Fondly known among his fellow peers and common soldiers as the "hero of many battles", Cyrille is the younger brother to the duc d'Erie, widely regarded as a paragon of chivalry and gallantry. It is noted that without his brilliant tactical leadership, House Erie would have long perished, and it is thanks to Cyrille, the cities of Pont-aux-Griffes and Erie resisted three sieges over the course of ten years. The tale many recount at dinners and outings is one at the second siege of Pont-aux-Griffes, where the Comté held the bridge with a small group of knights against a vastly superior Eyrian force.\n\nIn spite of his almost legendary exploits, Cyrille remains unclouded from delusions of grandeur. His sole commitment remains the furthering the cause of his liege lord, distancing himself from the politicking and schemes in the ducal court. When it comes to management and paperwork, Cyrille usually delegates the responsibility, preferring to concentrate on his training and family. Regardless of his immense propaganda value, the Comté continues charging headlong into the next battle, leading the troops under his command wondering if he has a suppressed death wish, or simply vicious bloodthirsty tendencies.\n\nThus, the Comté d'Pont-aux-Griffes remains an instrumental griffon for the continued success of House Erie.\n\n"

ERI_grand_inventor:0 "Fabrice Assaultine"
ERI_grand_inventor_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 10th of July, 965 in Bruma\n§YOccupation§!: Grand Inventeur\n\n§YBiography§!: The fourth child of an average Herzlander family, Fabrice Assaultine was quick to learn from the world around him. Tinkering with machines and tools, his adept claws made many improvements to existing designs, and his natural brilliance eventually earned him a place at the most distinguished universities of Yale. Prodigal genius did not result in having aptitude in social niceties, and he ended up expelled twice, for publicly humiliating the university rector in a competition and creating unusual machinery that had many swear they were powered by unholy energies.\nUnbothered by ostracisation, Fabrice was quick to adapt and taught himself everything he wanted and needed to know, travelling far and wide in search of a wealthy patron to support his many indulgences. Self-described as a scientist in every discipline, he did not stay anywhere for too long, even as many yearned for his superior inventions, such as the efficient internal combustion engine, or automata that functioned without magical aid. When his travels led him to Verenia, he found steady employment as the Duke's personal advisor and innovator, opening several workshops dedicated to science.\nFabrice's arrogance has not receded in the slightest, and many in the Duke's court despise him for his contemptuous attitude and lowborn origins. He dismisses their short sighted criticisms, and spends most of his days creating the weapon that will tip the war in the Duke's favour, as well as many nights spent drinking and gambling with his employer.\n\n"

erie.1.t:0 "An Introduction To A Sordid Tale"
erie.1.d:0 "My name is Vincent, the true duke of Verenia. For decades, I've waged a war of unmatched ferocity and fervour over these lands against my accursed half-brother, Iovinus, the false duke. In the past, our ancestors have ruled Verenia and its lush plains, lucrative river trade routes and splendid cities, whose grandeur only increased after we swore fealty to the rising Groverian Empire. However, everything changed after those filthy, uppity revolutionaries tore through the region, and left many of my family hanging on trees, including poor father. With the line of succession unclear, and my vacuous brother unwilling to submit, there was no choice but to fight for the title.\n\nAlas, victory was within my grasp, if it weren't for that trollop Katrina, who absconded with a sizeable portion of my property and soldiers. The endless stalemate developed, and Verenia fell behind in terms of development and population. Indeed, I've even heard that in distant corners of Griffonia, they make jokes of two dunderhead dukes fighting over worthless rocks. To this I say, nay! They do not realise the beauty of this land, which I dearly love with all my heart. I'd love nothing more to see it restored to what it once was, even if in the end I'm forced to submit to some other rising tyrant.\n\nFortunately, my few and faithful retainers (the same cannot be said about the worthless peasants who keep complaining) work tirelessly in achieving the noble goal. Alongside the noble families who are sworn to the Erian Midnight Banner, the most notable griffons in this House are my biological younger brother Cyrille (who in spite of his stuffy attitude, he is a very brave and capable commander), a brilliant mind named Fabrice (provides me with new inventions and drinking company on weekends) and Livio, the court rat (his schemes have not always produced the required information, but he is too valuable to dispose of).\nThese are my capabilities, and I shall stop at nothing to achieve my rightful claim to the throne."

 ### FOCUS ###

 # Economic #
 
 BRZ_finish_the_ravenworks:0 "Finish the Grover V Industrial Park"
 BRZ_finish_the_ravenworks_desc:0 "The Grover V Industrial Park is a free economic zone conceptualised by the economic ministers of Grover V and Count Ignatius Bronzetail. The goal of the project is to attract investment from Griffenheim in order to finance new factories in the region. The closeness of the industrial park and the loyalty of our government ensures the safety of investment while also offering easy access to Griffonian markets."

 BRZ_engineering_grants:0 "Hire Imperial Experts"
 BRZ_engineering_grants_desc:0 "Bronzehill's industrial sector has lagged far behind much of the continent, owing to the mismanagement and poor expertise of the Diamond Dog administration advising its development. As such, our administration has requested help from Griffenheim in the hopes that our emperor will come to our aid and provide technical assistance to correct the damage done."

 BRZ_nationalise_the_ravenworks:0 "Nationalise the Grover V Industrial Park"
 BRZ_nationalise_the_ravenworks_desc:0 "The Grover V Industrial Park has not been a silver bullet to help kickstart our industrial revolution. Instead many of the plots remain barren and the few established firms either flounder or fail to make a profit. As such, many within our imperial administration have called on us to nationalise the industrial park and put it under state management until it proves stable and profitable."

 BRZ_give_to_the_poor:0 "Form a Social Safety Net"
 BRZ_give_to_the_poor_desc:0 "Many of Bronzehill's citizens live in crushing poverty with the toil of their day to day life spent on nothing but the food, shelter, and resources to survive. In order to address this issue, our administration has earmarked funding for a generous social programme which will include housing, healthcare, and food subsidises for our poorest citizens."

 BRZ_local_owned_industries:0 "Subsidise Domestic Firms"
 BRZ_local_owned_industries_desc:0 "The vast majority of Bronzehill's economic activity has been controlled by firms whose headquarters are located within Griffenheim and Mirabelle. While these firms prosper from Bronzehill's wealth, our own domestic firms have proved lackluster, failing to reach the same level of prominence. By subsidizing such firms we'd greatly benefit from increased domestic influence in economic affairs."

 BRZ_found_bronze_olwerke:0 "Bronze Ole"
 BRZ_found_bronze_olwerke_desc:0 "For the last 20 years, surveyors have stalked our lands in search of natural resources. During the course of their landscaping, these teams discovered a substantial reserve of oil and natural gas in Pinesshade. While currently free from development, a group of investors have pooled together their resources to establish Bronze Ole, a domestic energy firm which hopes to capitalise off our rich reserves."

 BRZ_kickstart_the_automotive_industry:0 "Bronzehill Automotive Firm"
 BRZ_kickstart_the_automotive_industry_desc:0 "Across the globe, the automobile has allowed for easier, quicker, and more reliable transportation of people and goods. Previously, the automobile was an oddity in Bronzehill, only accessible to those rich enough to import models from Griffenheim. With the opening the Bronzehill Automotive Firm however, it's hoped that the automobile will become all the more accessible."

 BRZ_the_forges_of_the_bronze_paw:0 "A Bronzehill Industrial Revolution"
 BRZ_the_forges_of_the_bronze_paw_desc:0 "The economy of Bronzehill stands triumphant as we enter the next stage of our industrial modernisation. While there is much progress to be made, we can look back proudly knowing that it was through our own blood, sweat, and tears that we have made it this far."

 BRZ_found_vereinigte_stahlwerke:0 "Vereinigte Stahlwerk"
 BRZ_found_vereinigte_stahlwerke_desc:0 "For decades, the firms of the Griffonian Empire have set up steel mills in Bronzekreuz, using the regions rich supplies of coal, iron, and cheap labour to produce steel. Little of this remains within Bronzehill, with the bulk being exported while we are left in chronic shortage. To address this, our government has entered into a partnership with Diamond Dog investors to set a domestically operated enterprise."

 BRZ_farming_subsidies:0 "Agricultural Grants"
 BRZ_farming_subsidies_desc:0 "The mountainous geography and chilly climate of Bronzehill have made the development of agriculture rather difficult, putting us in a situation where we rely heavily upon the import of food in order to feed our dogs. However, with proper funding we can provide grants to firms willing to build irrigation networks and import modern agrochemicals into our nation, greatly increasing productivity."

 BRZ_young_readers_programmes:0 "Establish a Unified Curriculum"
 BRZ_young_readers_programmes_desc:0 "While education is mandatory for all pups under the age of 9, the curriculum and quality of lessons can vary greatly depending on which region the pup resides. This has resulted in some towns and villages offering a subpar education which can even flounder in providing basic literacy. By creating a unified curriculum and hiring qualified teachers we can ensure a solid education for all pups to come."

 BRZ_open_the_university_of_bronzekreuz:0 "Bronzekreuz Imperial University"
 BRZ_open_the_university_of_bronzekreuz_desc:0 "Bronzehill is the only nation in the entire Griffonian Empire without a centre for higher education, resulting in many students having to venture abroad to complete their studies. The establishment of a proper centre of learning within Bronzekreuz would hopefully divert this brain drain and help to create a centre for research, scientific thought, and higher learning upon our very own soil."

 BRZ_clan_azar_dun_exiles:0 "Welcome Refugees from Clan Azar-Dun"
 BRZ_clan_azar_dun_exiles_desc:0 "Within the depths of the Diamond Mountain resides a clan of Diamond Dogs especially skilled at the building, maintenance, and development of complex electronics. These dogs are known as the Warlock-Engineers of Clan Azar-Dun. While these dogs receive substantial rewards from the tyrants of the mountain, many within their ranks still wish to flee to the safety of our realm."

 BRZ_scientific_research_groups:0 "BITE"
 BRZ_scientific_research_groups_desc:0 "The Bronzehill Institute of Technicians and Engineers was established in order to pool together the collective mental resources of our nation. The goal of this institute is to provide a venue for the collaboration of projects in the hope that it'll make the research and development of new technologies proceed quicker than before."

 BRZ_expand_crystal_mines:0 "Embracing Our Legacy"
 BRZ_expand_crystal_mines_desc:0 "The extraction of precious gems and crystals has always been an integral part of Diamond Dog culture, dating back to the first of our clans. Our nation is no exception, providing the most lucrative crystal mines within the entire empire. While their production is already impressive, there is still room for expansion with the possibility of mines in Crownspike looking especially promising."

 BRZ_liberal_banking_reform:0 "Liberalise the Bronzehill Banking System"
 BRZ_liberal_banking_reform_desc:0 "The Bronzehill banking system was hit hard in the aftermath of the empire's decline, resulting in the defaulting of many branches. While there has been some recovery since the worst days, our banking system still rests on a rocky foundation. By liberalizing our banking laws, we can create a more attractive environment for foreign finance to enter and eject fresh capital into our economy and banks."

 BRZ_extend_development_grants:0 "Prop Up the Grover V Industrial Park"
 BRZ_extend_development_grants_desc:0 "The Grover V Industrial Park has not been a silver bullet to help kickstart our industrial revolution. Instead many of the plots remain barren and the few established firms either flounder or fail to make a profit. As such, our government has begun to offer subsidises and grants to foreign firms willing to relocate to the park in the hope that it'll attract better equipped businesses who can generate a profit."

 BRZ_reopen_the_markets:0 "Make Goldtooth Economic Minister"
 BRZ_reopen_the_markets_desc:0 "Max Goldtooth is a renown economist within the Griffonian Empire who preaches a hardline liberal stance on economic affairs, believing that governments should provide little oversight over the actions of private firms. By offering him a position in our administration, it's hoped that he can make Bronzehill a lucrative investment for capitalists in Griffenheim and beyond."

 BRZ_imperial_cooperation:0 "Deepen Imperial Ties"
 BRZ_imperial_cooperation_desc:0 "Griffenheim has always been a reliable investor in our economy, bringing our nation from the brink of ruin to the state it's in today. We must once again go to the imperial court and plead our case, begging their excellency to come to our aid and strengthen the economic ties which have served us so well."

 BRZ_investment_competition:0 "Attract Foreign Investment"
 BRZ_investment_competition_desc:0 "By relying upon the capitalists and nobles of Griffenheim to finance our economic development, we severely constricted the supply of capital on which we could call upon. Our lands are rich in resources and our dogs willing to work hard for their future. We are a land ripe with possible investments and we should begin to cut deals based on profits and not loyalty to the imperial throne."

 BRZ_expand_the_ravenworks:0 "Expand the Grover V Industrial Park"
 BRZ_expand_the_ravenworks_desc:0 "What was once a floundering enterprise, on the brink of death, has become a success story with millions of bits worth of profits flowing into the coffers of Bronzekreuz and Griffenheim. The space offered by the Grover V Industrial Park has been completed rented out and there are calls to expand the industrial infrastructure in the hope of securing more firms and investment for our nation's development."

 BRZ_underground_railway:0 "Underground Railroad"
 BRZ_underground_railway_desc:0 "Diamond Dogs might have many shortcomings but our skill at taming mountainous terrain is matched by none. While other species struggle to build infrastructure upon mountains, we have learned to bury deep below them, laying our track and building our roads along the vast tunnel networks our ancestors have excavated for generations."
 
 BRZ_refit_standerd_rail_gages:0 "Adopt the Imperial Rail Gauge"
 BRZ_refit_standerd_rail_gages_desc:0 "There is one last hurdle that remains in the way of trade between our economy and that of the Griffonian Empire as a whole. This is the issue of our rail gauges. Due to our heavy use of subterranean trade networks we have adapted to smaller trains on thinner tracks. By retrofitting the rail lines of our southern lands, to the Imperial standard, we can more easily trade with our Griffon allies."

 BRZ_the_new_industrial_heartland:0 "A Griffonian Industrial Revolution"
 BRZ_the_new_industrial_heartland_desc:0 "The economy of Bronzehill stands triumphant as we enter the next stage of our industrial modernisation. While there is much progress to be made, we can look back proudly, knowing that it was through our unwavering loyalty to the crown and closeness to the empire that we managed to make it this far."

 BRZ_industrial_reform_laws:0 "Industrial Reforms"
 BRZ_industrial_reform_laws_desc:0 "Many of the inefficient and archaic bureaucracies which plagued our initial industrial revolution still linger to this day, offering a barrier to firms wishing to establish themselves in our lands. By removing many of the old guard within these agencies, we can install fresh blood and reform the organisations into something which can actually benefit economic development."

 BRZ_employment_works_act:0 "Right to Fair Work Act"
 BRZ_employment_works_act_desc:0 "The Right to Fair Work Act mandates that the goal of the Bronzehill government is to ensure that every Diamond Dog who is willing, is employed within a field which will provide them with the resources to live a fulfilling life. In order to accomplish this goal, the government will subsidise firms in order to ensure the opening of new positions and establishment of a living wage."

 BRZ_hundburg_mine:0 "Hundburg Mine"
 BRZ_hundburg_mine_desc:0 "The mountains of Bronzehill are rich in resources necessary to fuel our industrial revolution. However, new mines must be built to access these reserves. A promising location for such mines is near the village of Hundburg. Reports from prospectors in the region have generated a buzz amongst Griffenheim's investors and already requests have flooded in, begging us to lease these lands."

 # Military #

 BRZ_military_budget_review:0 "Defence Budget of 1007"
 BRZ_military_budget_review_desc:0 "Military funding has never been a very high priority amongst the ministers of Bronzehill, owing to the ethos of pacifism that both our government and dogs share. This had led to our military being severely outdated with equipment which is decades obsolete. However, with tensions rising on the continent it has become vital to begin modernizing our forces."

 BRZ_review_the_defencive_lines:0 "Bunkers are Our Backbone"
 BRZ_review_the_defencive_lines_desc:0 "The limited scale of our military means that it can only engage meaningfully when on the defensive. Thankfully, the mountainous terrain of Bronzehill and the subterranean nature of Diamond Dogs have allowed us to develop an intricate system of bunkers within the mountains. With additional funding, these fortifications can be upgraded and better equipped for the conflict ahead."

 BRZ_fortify_against_the_south:0 "Fortify the Lowlands"
 BRZ_fortify_against_the_south_desc:0 "The lowlands of Bronzehill house the bulk of the nation's population, industry, and economic development. As such, it should be our upmost priority to fortify these regions in the face of foreign invasion, creating a compressive network of bunkers, fall back positions, and subterranean tunnel systems."

 BRZ_fortify_against_the_west:0 "Fortify the Bellen"
 BRZ_fortify_against_the_west_desc:0 "The Bellen River acts as a vital artery connecting our lands to Griffenheim. Along this river is the bulk of our industrial base, economy, and resources extraction facilities. If this artery were to be severed the imperial throne would lose an important source of resources for their war effort. As such, it's important that we centre our defences on this river and ensure that it remains open to trade."

 BRZ_defence_plan_bone_focus:0 "War Plan Bone"
 BRZ_defence_plan_bone_focus_desc:0 "War Plan Bone was first drafted in 976, by Field Martial Theo Kaza-Gull in the face of possible invasion from the east by River Federation forces. It calls for a rigid defensive line to be formed on the frontier by a vanguard force which will buy time to evacuate materials, resources, and divisions into the mountains of Highhill and Crownspike where they will fight a protracted guerilla campaign."

 BRZ_anti_pacifism_campaign:0 "Challenge Our Ethos"
 BRZ_anti_pacifism_campaign_desc:0 "Pacifism has been a core component of Bronzehill society since its inception, owing to the oppression many of our dogs faced at the hands of the Diamond Mountain military. While these traumas will take generations to be resolved, our borders are now immediately threatened. We must bend this spirit of pacifism in order to ensure the security of our nation."

 BRZ_reopen_bronzekreuz_militery_acadamy:0 "Reopen the Bronzekreuz Military Academy"
 BRZ_reopen_bronzekreuz_militery_acadamy_desc:0 "The Bronzekreuz Military Academy was opened soon after our independence, with Griffenheim using it to help foster a domestic officer corp. However, when it became apparent that our military would never grow beyond a self-defence force, the facility was defunded and shut down. Now, In the face of nearing conflict, it has become vital that we reopen this academy."

 BRZ_armour_tests:0 "Mobile Bunkers"
 BRZ_armour_tests_desc:0 "The Imperial Army has experimented with armoured warfare for some time, developing a few battalions of tanks to augment their forces. The effectiveness of tanks in warfare can not be understated. Of special interest to us are the heavier designs, which would help guarantee our defences with the ability to plug breaches in our lines with these mobile bunkers."

 BRZ_modern_guns:0 "Mobile Artillery"
 BRZ_modern_guns_desc:0 "The combination of a tank chassis with one of our phenomenally designed artillery pieces allows them to be moved under their own independent propulsion. By developing a vehicle which combines these two technologies we'd greatly benefit from increased mobility, allowing us to respond to situational developments with better flexibility and speed."

 BRZ_reencourage_artillery_development:0 "Reignite the Bronze Forge"
 BRZ_reencourage_artillery_development_desc:0 "The Bronze Forge was originally designed to be the central armoury for all of Bronzehill's military needs. However, the limited scope of our army, and the lack of interest in exporting arms, meant the forge was closed in favour of importing arms from Griffenheim. However, In the face of our current crisis, it's become paramount to reignite the forges and produce our own domestic weaponry."

 BRZ_light_artillery:0 "Light Artillery"
 BRZ_light_artillery_desc:0 "Our mountainous and hilly terrain creates an environment of many tight crevice and narrow ridges in which traditional guns could get jammed and bogged down. By investing in alternative materials and design methods we can slim down our weapons with only a minor reduction in calibre. These new lighter guns would then be ideally suited for such rugged terrain."

 BRZ_heavy_artillery:0 "Heavy Artillery"
 BRZ_heavy_artillery_desc:0 "At one time, the Bronze Forge had a reputation for producing truly impressive guns with calibres far larger than anything else in Griffonia. This reputation is just waiting to be reclaimed, under the ideal of building bigger, better, and more effective artillery. If properly deployed it could prove a decisive factor in strengthening our defences."

 BRZ_high_altitued_training:0 "Guerilla Training"
 BRZ_high_altitued_training_desc:0 "In the face of invasion, our forces are expected to retreat into the mountains of Crownspike. Fighting here will be based less on traditional methods of war and be more focused on hit and run, ambush, and guerilla tactics. As such, it's important that our forces are trained in the skills necessary to wage a successful guerilla campaign."

 BRZ_expand_the_gunforges:0 "Expand the Bronzekreuz Forges"
 BRZ_expand_the_gunforges_desc:0 "For decades, weapon production within Bronzehill has been extremely limited with only a few state operated factories producing a limited quantity of ammunition and licensed rifles. However, in the face of growing uncertainty, our government has earmarked funding to drastically increase the productivity of these factories in order to supply our growing needs."

 BRZ_support_company_intergration:0 "Bronzehill Corp of Engineers"
 BRZ_support_company_intergration_desc:0 "The Bronzehill Corp of Engineers is a branch of the army which specialises in a number of niche combat duties such as maintaining vehicles, providing logistical services, and aiding in general engineering projects. By further integrating these units into our frontline divisions we would see improved communication and provision of services in the conflict ahead."

 BRZ_licence_guns:0 "Bronzehill-Griffenheim Accords"
 BRZ_licence_guns_desc:0 "The Bronzehill-Griffenheim Accords are a series of treaties rooted in the deep connection between our two nations. While these accords cover a variety of topics, one of the most respected is the accord relating to military cooperation. In it, our government is promised protection, cooperation between forces, and the freedom to buy imperial weapon designs."

 BRZ_farwoof_studdies:0 "Far Woof Defence Network"
 BRZ_farwoof_studdies_desc:0 "Far Woof is the informal nickname given by many within Bronzehill's military elite to RADAR technology. While our use of the technology is rather limited, with only a few experimental units, advisors from our Griffon allies assure us that the mountains of our nation would be the ideal location to develop a long-range RADAR-based detection network."

 BRZ_estabilish_the_air_corpes:0 "Establish the Bronzehill Imperial Air Force"
 BRZ_estabilish_the_air_corpes_desc:0 "Diamonds Dogs have always been a landlocked species, unable to traverse the skies. Throughout our history that has put us at a disadvantage as the winged pegasus and griffons have struck mercilessly at us from the safety of the sky. However, recent technological innovation has allowed us to overcome our natural limitation and fight within the air as equals."

 BRZ_heavy_airframes:0 "Arthur Terrier Doctrine"
 BRZ_heavy_airframes_desc:0 "Arthur Terrier is a military theorist who claims that the focus of an air force should primarily be on targeting enemy cities with bombers, dropping massive payloads on industrial targets. He states that the focus of aircraft development should be primarily on bombers and the long-range fighters needed to support them in the field."

 BRZ_light_airframes:0 "Richard Barker Doctrine"
 BRZ_light_airframes_desc:0 "Richard Barker is a military theorist who claims that the focus of an air force should primarily be on providing air support to ground units. In order to achieve this goal, he claims that our air force should focus upon aircraft designed for close air support roles and the shorter-range fighters needed to support them."

 BRZ_paratroopers:0 "The 82nd 'Grounded Griffons' Battalion"
 BRZ_paratroopers_desc:0 "The 82nd Battalion is a unit of some renown, known for its fierce devotion to protecting our border with Firtree. The griffon advisors attached the unit, claimed that these dogs could fight with the valour of a grounded griffons, garnering the unit its nickname. Recent developments in aircraft doctrine and design have finally given the 82nd a chance to return to the sky."

 BRZ_flying_artillery:0 "Airborne Artillery"
 BRZ_flying_artillery_desc:0 "A bomb is very much like an artillery shell, being a mixture of high explosives and gunpowder wrapped up nicely in a metal casing. Hell, both of them even rain from the sky, meaning they are virtually the same to the enemy unlucky enough to encounter them. Greater investment from our production resources into bomb building would see higher yields and increased reliability."

 BRZ_air_forges:0 "The Bronzehill Aircraft Factory"
 BRZ_air_forges_desc:0 "In this era of modern war, it has become vitally important to finance the research, development, and production of aircraft for combat. To support in this endeavour our government has financed the construction of the Bronzehill Aircraft Factory, a facility which will specialise in the efficient construction of our military aircraft."

 BRZ_rocket_experiments:0 "The Var-Silfur Research Facility"
 BRZ_rocket_experiments_desc:0 "Var-Silfur is a town nestled in the mountains of Crownspike, being nearly impossible to access through conventional means. Our military has recommended that we construct a research facility here, using it to research experimental technologies while also being safe from the interference of enemy spies and saboteurs."

 BRZ_military_research_group:0 "Department of Research and Development"
 BRZ_military_research_group_desc:0 "Modern war is a rapidly evolving creature, with the dynamics of conflict bringing about swift technological progress. Rifles, tanks, planes, and tactics all change on a year by year basis. In order to keep up with this field, our ministers have created the Department of Research and Development, a branch of the Bronzehill military focused on keeping us competitive in this regard."

 # Political - General#

 BRZ_reforme_the_bronze_council:0 "Reform the Bronze Council"
 BRZ_reforme_the_bronze_council_desc:0 "In times of crisis, the Count has a duty to his dogs to form the Bronze Council, a body of the nation's ministers, nobles, and leading figures. This body works towards guiding the nation through troubled times, with the Count acting as the figure overseeing debates and dialog. With the Emperor dead and his empire on the brink of civil war, Count Ignatius Bronzehill must perform this duty."

 BRZ_go_with_gabriela:0 "Stand with Gabriela"
 BRZ_go_with_gabriela_desc:0 "As tensions rise within the imperial court, two factions have emerged in the regency debate. One led by Duchess Gabriela Eagleclaw and the other by the Archon Eros VII. The Duchess stands for the traditional order of the empire, as it was under Grover V, respecting the delicate balance in society between the nobility and commoner. As such, it is without question that we should support her claim."

 BRZ_go_with_archon:0 "Stand with the Archon"
 BRZ_go_with_archon_desc:0 "As tensions rise within the imperial court, two factions have emerged in the regency debate. One led by Duchess Gabriela Eagleclaw and the other by the Archon Eros VII. The Archon stands as a force of reform within the empire, breaking down the barriers between nobility and commoner, unifying society under a common goal. As such, it is without question that we should support his claim."

 BRZ_denounce_the_false_masters:0 "A Bronzehill Regency"
 BRZ_denounce_the_false_masters_desc:0 "As tensions rise within the imperial court, two factions have emerged in the regency debate. One led by Duchess Gabriela Eagleclaw and the other by the Archon Eros VII. However, both factions are simply seeking to promote their own self-interests and agendas. As such, we must stand against these traitors and remember our heritage by providing Grover VI with abled advisors and regents."

 BRZ_secure_the_north:0 "Destroy the Strawberry Pact"
 BRZ_secure_the_north_desc:0 "Gabriela runs rampant in the north, refusing to recognise the legitimacy of our regency. Her faction must be broken and her lands returned to the administration of Grover VI. Only then can the Empire know peace."

 BRZ_secure_the_south:0 "Destroy the Archon's Alliance"
 BRZ_secure_the_south_desc:0 "The Archon seeds terror in the south, refusing to recognise the legitimacy of our regency. His faction must be brought to the sword and his allies' lands returned to the administration of Grover VI. Only then can the Empire know peace."

 BRZ_intergrate_the_north:0 "New Imperial Titles"
 BRZ_intergrate_the_north_desc:0 "With the conquest of the Strawberry Duchy, Feathisia, and Greifenmarschen it has become vital to bring these lands back under imperial dominion. To accomplish this, two new titles have been bestowed upon Grover VI. He will now be known as the King of Strawberry and Mirabelle, and Archduke of Greater Feathisia."

 BRZ_intergrate_the_south:0 "Outlaw Feudalism"
 BRZ_intergrate_the_south_desc:0 "While feudalism and serfdom have been, for the most part, abandoned by the majority of the empire, it still lingers within our southern domains. By outlawing the practice, we can ensure the loyalty of the lower classes, within these provinces, while also breaking any lingering power held by the despots that formerly ruled them."

 # Political - Harmony/Gabriela # 

 BRZ_reformation_act:0 "Formalise the Bronze Council"
 BRZ_reformation_act_desc:0 "Traditionally the Bronze Council is supposed to exist as a temporary body used to deal with a temporary problem. Yet, as the current crisis deepens, it has become apparent that it will take many years to deal with. As such, the Bronze Council must become a formalised institution with a constitution drafted in order to give it legal status and the ability to assist in governance."

 BRZ_lift_political_restrictions:0 "Open the Bronze Council"
 BRZ_lift_political_restrictions_desc:0 "The Bronze Council has always been an aristocratic body, representing the interests of the landed elite. However, the overwhelming majority of our population is not represented, ranging from miners, to farmers, to wealthy merchants. All of them desire a voice within this new Bronze Council and we should seek to reform it to be more inclusive."

 BRZ_first_elections:0 "The First Election"
 BRZ_first_elections_desc:0 "As the Bronze Council has become more open to all segments of society, there have been calls to democratise it. Count Ignatius Bronzetail has responded to these demands for democracy, promising to dismiss his current council and host elections to select its new members."

 BRZ_office_of_science_and_industry:0 "Ministry of Science and Industry"
 BRZ_office_of_science_and_industry_desc:0 "The Ministry of Science and Industry was established in order to assist the Bronzehill economy by providing financial and other forms of assistance to research and development projects. This is chiefly done through the financing and provision of grants to domestic firms looking to invest into locale developments."

 BRZ_found_bronzetech:0 "Found Bronzetech"
 BRZ_found_bronzetech_desc:0 "The mountains of Bronzehill are rich in silica and copper. Previously, these minerals were shipped south to Griffenheim where they'd be processed into radios and other electronics before being sold back to us. However, with tensions rising between our administration and that of the imperial court, it has become vital that we establish our own domestic electronics firm to fill the gap left by the crisis."

 BRZ_the_copperhill_cabinate:0 "The Copperhill Cabinet"
 BRZ_the_copperhill_cabinate_desc:0 "In the wake of our first election, political parties have begun to form with prominent ministers gathering support for their causes. Currently, the largest of these parties are the Harmonic Conservatives who are led by former Minister of Minerals Winston Coppertail. His party is heavily aligned with the cause of Duchess Eagleclaw and he wishes to see the traditional administration returned to Griffenheim."

 BRZ_estabilish_the_office_of_the_prime_minister:0 "Establish the Office of Prime Minister"
 BRZ_estabilish_the_office_of_the_prime_minister_desc:0 "The increasing intricacy of the Bronze Council has led to Count Bronzetail forming the post of Prime Minister, an office which will take on the leadership role previously held by the Count himself. The duty of the Prime Minister is to lead the council and govern it effectively. As the leader of the largest party, Winston Coppertail was a natural first choice for this post."

 BRZ_harmonic_life_laws:0 "The Species Equality Act"
 BRZ_harmonic_life_laws_desc:0 "Griffonian is a continent of many species with diamond dogs, griffons, ponies, changelings, zebras, and deer all calling it home.

When he was five years old, he travelled to the Imperial City to see Grover V’s coronation and was enamoured by the splendour. He returned to the city many times and studied there at Emperor’s College, gaining a degree in politics.\n\nHe became a close friend of the Emperor, who attended his wedding to Izzy Bones-Iron, daughter of the Lord Gems. With her he has had two children, Barnaby and Margaret.\n\nDuring his rule he has been a competent administrator and a beloved defender of Bronzehill and the Emperor, however his policies on supporting Griffon industry over Bronzehill’s own has led to the formation of several communist organisations in Bronzehill. And while he has the full support of the Bronze Council, there are those who question his ability to lead effectively should Bronzehill be faced by a disaster such as the Republican Uprising during his father’s reign.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

 ### EVENTS ###
 bronzehill.1.t:0 "A Messenger in the Night"
 bronzehill.1.d:0 "Count Ignatius' paws gripped tightly into his wooden throne. There had to be some mistake. Or perhaps this was just some cruel joke? He stared down at the griffon messenger who remained bowed at the foot of his throne. He wore a simple black cloak, held around him by an Imperial broach. One given out by the Emperor himself.\n\nThe pit that had opened in his stomach only grew wider. It couldn't be true, it just couldn't.\n\n\"Say it again,\" he said. His throat was dry and each word was a painful, breathless gasp.\n\n\"My Lord,\" the messenger said. \"The Emperor. He's...\"\n\nDead. The word hung in Count Ignatius' mind like a ball in flight. The throne creaked under his grip. No, it couldn't be true. How could the Emperor have died? He was always there - just like the sun and the moon. Without him there would be no world. There would be no light, no beauty, no joy. How could there be without him?\n\nCount Ignatius couldn't feel his own heart anymore. It was as if it some unseen being had ripped it out of his chest, leaving only an inky black void in his place. His essence of life and very soul had vanished with the messenger's words. Perhaps for good.\n\nHe launched himself from his seat, startling the messenger. \"No! You... You lie! It's not true. It can't be true. The Emperor. He can't... He can't be...\"\n\nA rasping choke caught in Count Ignatius' throat. He was on the ground now with his tail between his legs. He didn't know how he had fallen there. It hurt to breath and his eyes burned as if someone had rubbed lime and soap into them. And there was a sound. A pained, unnatural sound that echoed all around. Like the wails of a million lost souls all crying out in pain.\n\nHis ears stood on ends, fearful of the source, whatever horror it might be. Then he realised it: The sound was coming from his own throat and joined in with a symphony of anguish from all other dogs in his court.\n\nThe Emperor was Dead. And every dog in Bronzehill wept that day."
 bronzehill.1.a:0 "No, please no. Please..."

 bronzehill.2.t:0 "A Nation Mourns"
 bronzehill.2.d:0 "Across the nation, news of Grover's death has rocked our dogs. A great sense of mourning has washed across the populace with all aspects of daily life grinding to a halt.\n\nFactories and mines are reporting mass absences, trains have come to a stop as the dogs needed to run them are too preoccupied, even many shops and services are failing to remain open as shopkeepers and bureaucrats have been left paralysed.\n\nCount Ignatius Bronzetail has addressed his dogs in these trying times, proclaiming a state of national mourning. Across the nation flags now flutter at half-mast, a position which they are expected to maintain for quite some time."
 bronzehill.2.a:0 "The end of an era"

 bronzehill.3.t:0 "The Flower Gems"
 bronzehill.3.d:0 "It is a Diamond Dog tradition, that in the event of a death, the family and friends of the deceased are expected to gather a bouquet of precious stones known as flower gems. These stunning rocks are then crafted into a beautiful display which adorns the deceased's grave and acts as a reminder of how much they were loved and cherished.\n\nIn the wake of Grover's death, the dogs of Bronzehill have begun a migration to the capital. Each of them depositing their own collection of gems at the count's palace. Within a day this collection was impressive, within a week it was majestic, now it's overwhelming.\n\nCount Ignatius Bronzetail has commissioned the greatest artisans of the county to work together and manufacture these gems into a grand display of our dogs' devotion to the emperor. Already this display has begun to take shape, composed of a beautiful statue of Grover's likeness with a base that houses a mural which promotes the Emperor's many accomplishments.\n\nAs it nears completion, we must decide if we should send this to Griffenheim, as a solemn gift to Grover VI, or if it should remain in Bronzekreuz as a monument to our devotion and loyalty to the crown."
 bronzehill.3.a:0 "Send it to Griffenheim"
 bronzehill.3.b:0 "Display it in Bronzekreuz"

 bronzehill.4.t:0 "Bronzehill Sends a Gift"
 bronzehill.4.d:0 "In the wake of the emperor's death, our vassals in Bronzehill have presented us with a truly beautiful gift. It is a part of Diamond Dog culture, that in the event of a death, the dogs close to deceased will gather gemstones, known as flower gems, and sculp them into a memorial.\n\nThese dogs have remembered their loyalty to the crown well and have submitted their gift, crafting a truly impressive statue of Grover V constructed out of precious gems gathered by hundreds of thousands of the county's citizens.\n\nMany have called for us to place this statue in the imperial mausoleum as a sign of our gratitude for this cherished gift. While it would no doubt be a glorious addition to the emperor's tomb, it can not be ignored that this statue would fetch a rather high price amongst art collectors with the money helping to stabilise our budget."
 bronzehill.4.a:0 "Send our thanks to Bronzehill"
 bronzehill.4.b:0 "It's a shame it never arrived..."

 bronzehill.5.t:0 "Griffenheim Accepts our Gift"
 bronzehill.5.d:0 "Our gift to the imperial court has been graciously accepted with our statue being proudly displayed within the hallowed grounds of the imperial mausoleum. For generations to come, many will pass through those chambers and see our contribution to Grover V's memory presented front and centre.\n\nA thank you letter from Grover VI was received by Count Ignatius Bronzetail. In it, the young emperor thanks both the Count and his subjects for their lovely gift and he assures us all that our devotion has made these troubled times easier.\n\nIt's rumoured that the Count had this letter framed and displayed within his personal office."
 bronzehill.5.a:0 "May our bond with Griffenheim never waver."

 bronzehill.6.t:0 "Insult from Griffenheim"
 bronzehill.6.d:0 "For days, the status of our memorial to Grover V has been left in limbo. We knew for a fact that it was received in Griffenheim but information on its whereabouts weas left fuzzy as soon as it was tranfered to imperial officials. Days passed and there was no official word from the imperial court.\n\nHowever, a leading Griffenheim capitalist recently hosted a memorial ball, which our ambassador attended. In his report, our ambassador states that he discovered that our memorial was not only in the possession of this capitalist but that he had purchased it from government officials for a considerable amount of money.\n\nWhen pressured, the imperial court failed to provide a statement."
 bronzehill.6.a:0 "Was it...not good enough?"

 bronzehill.7.t:0 "Bronzehill Nationalises Imperial Assets"
 bronzehill.7.d:0 "Much of Bronzehill's industrial, infrastructure, and mining assets are owned and operated by firms based in Griffenheim. This is due to the imperial court having a vested interest in overseeing the economy of Bronzehill for the benefit of its citizens.\n\nHowever, recently there has been talk of nationalizing these assets, with claims of mismanagement and that not enough economic benefit remains in Bronzehill. If this course of action is allowed to reach its conclusion this would mean a massive loss of monetary assets by some of our leading firms.\n\nCurrently the imperial court is divided between approaching this diplomatically, and issuing a strongly worded protest against our vassal, and taking a more forceful approach which would see us deliver a militarised reminder of our dominance."
 bronzehill.7.a:0 "We are busy with more pressing matters, let them nationalise"
 bronzehill.7.b:0 "Send a strongly worded protest"
 bronzehill.7.c:0 "It's about time that Bronzehill was put direct imperial control"

 bronzehill.8.t:0 "Griffenheim Protests our Nationalisation"
 bronzehill.8.d:0 "An official statement was received from Griffenheim today, in response to our proposed plans to nationalise imperial assets across Bronzehill. In it, Grover VI and his ministers discuss how they are disappointed that we are taking this course of action and beseech us to think twice before progressing with it. Grover VI also brought up how he has always known of our loyalty to him and knows that we will never let him down in these trying times."
 bronzehill.8.a:0 "What have we done?"
 bronzehill.8.b:0 "No, this is the right course of action. He'll see it someday."

 bronzehill.9.t:0 "Military Action Taken"
 bronzehill.9.d:0 "In the face of our nationalisation, the capitalists of Griffenheim have gotten their wish. The emperor has given royal consent to an invasion of our domains, in order to secure imperial economic assets. Already, troops are being amassed on our border and skirmishes have broken out between our border guards and troops of the Imperial Army.\n\nIt's expected that this upcoming invasion will end swiftly in our defeat.\n\nMay the gods have mercy upon us."
 bronzehill.9.a:0 "What have we done?"

 bronzehill.10.t:0 "Crisis in the Government"
 bronzehill.10.d:0 "The Empire is falling apart and with it, its subjects. It is truly dark tides that wash over our lands, and as former loyal subjects have broken away from Griffonhime in protest of the new regent, our own nation is paralysed with indecision. We must choose who to support and how to rebuild our politics. The situation is not an easy one, but to secure, actions must be taken."
 bronzehill.10.a:0 "Hard choices will have to be made..."

 bronzehill.11.t:0 "Bronzehill Reaffirms Loyalty to Griffenheim"
 bronzehill.11.d:0 "The Bronzehill representatives have officially confirmed they stand with us, which is a welcome sign in the crisis we face. As such, we must not turn the blind eye on their loyalty, since there is value in unity. Their deeds are noticed, they have earned a gift from the Empire."
 bronzehill.11.a:0 "Good dogs."

 bronzehill.111.t:0 "[GRI.GetLeader] Appreciates our Support"
 bronzehill.111.d:0 "It is a great relief for our nation to hear that the Empire still has our back while we have theirs, our cooperation continues. And for our loyalty, they sent us a token of their gratitude, which is a helpful wind of change in these trying times. May our cooperate continue and prosper."
 bronzehill.111.a:0 "Yay!"

 bronzehill.12.t:0 "Bronzehill-Feathisian Joint Air Plan"
 bronzehill.12.d:0 "A message from Bronzehill arrived today, in which the Bronzehill leadership asked for a cooperation on fighter production. It could be an opportunity to advance the industry, those dogs have plenty of resources. But, should we really trade our secrets for trinkets and baubles they can offer us?"
 bronzehill.12.a:0 "A wonderful idea!"
 bronzehill.12.b:0 "We're not interested in helping dogs fly."

 bronzehill.13.t:0 "The Founding of Beakker-Bronzehill"
 bronzehill.13.d:0 "The talks have come to fruition and Beakker has opened a branch office in our nation, so that we may cooperate and prosper together. This union will allow us to make quality aircrafts and further our partnership and forge a new ally, there is no such thing as too many allies."
 bronzehill.13.a:0 "Great!"

 bronzehill.14.t:0 "Talks with Feathisia Lead Nowhere"
 bronzehill.14.d:0 "After all the long discussions, there is no positive outcome from our talks with Feathisia. They were not interested in having anything to do with our offer, and thus we're back to where we began. It seems we won't be getting any help from anyone right now."
 bronzehill.14.a:0 "That's capatalism."

 bronzehill.15.t:0 "Invest in Bronzehill?"
 bronzehill.15.d:0 "Multiple Bronzehill envoys and representatives have been visiting our lands lately, mostly to wrangle support and interest in their country, looking for investments. Perhaps, this could be a tempting offer, as these dogs have a lot of untapped potential in their industry. We should contemplate if such an undertaking is worth considering, or is it just a fool's errand.."
 bronzehill.15.a:0 "A splendid idea!"

In terms of the monarchy, she believes that the office of Emperor should not be dismantled, instead she is critical of his bourgeois and aristocratic bureaucracy. Her supporters are a broad base, including many labour unions, intellectuals, and moderate socialists.\n\nThe second, Kimball Barking-Sun, a prominent miner and labour agitator from Crownspike, believes that the Council of the Left should be centralised around the office of chairhound and that the state should instead work towards self-sufficiency and defence. When it comes to the monarchy, Kimball believes that Grover has been given a heavenly mandate to oversee his domains.

But everyone knew the council was in deadlock, and so more than anything Dogs on the street tried to ignore this shame to their nation. But suddenly there was a cursed cry let out from the main avenue in the city\n\n\"Fire!\"\n\nLike the gears in a machine, past its prime but still good, the city moved to action. The fire brigade was brought out and they raced towards where the fire was reported. But when they arrived they stood motionless, as before them, stood the theatre that had served as the hall of their government. The Wiesetreffen was burning, the oldest building in the entire city and ancient construction of old Diamond Dog architecture lay fallow, burned faster than the city could respond. And then, the council rounded the corner, the first to witness the scorched skeleton of the building dropped to his paws and began to howl in sorrow, others soon followed.\n\nFirst the Emperor, now the Wiesetreffen… how much loss would the people suffer before things got better…\n\nBut even as they mourned, one dog thought he saw someone enter an alleyway down the road, a dog decked in the armor of the Bronze Cross… "

He didn't want to be here, but recent events had given him no choice, the burning of Wiesetreffen had shaken the nation to its core, the one shred of stability left in the capital was inside this house… When somedog opened the door he had to look down to find the figure and meet his eyes\n\n\"Ah, Count Ignatius! Come in come in.\" replied the dog, short in stature but no less of a presence, this was the dog he had come to meet.\n\nThe count shook off the biting snow that so often fell on the high mountains and followed the dog inside… every moment it pained him to know that this dog was in a better position here. The Großritter held the cards and he knew it. Still, he had known Lucky for a while and knew he was reasonable and that a deal could be worked out in the end. They engaged in small talk and then sat down to eat. After their meal, the Knight's demeanor changed. \n\n\"Face it, Ignatius, I know why you are here, and you know why I am accepting you into my parlor. You need somewhere to hold your council\"\n\nFor the first time in years, the count snapped \"Oh bugger to it Lucky.

And she was going to use it to their full advantages. Eros had sent her a pouch of gold with instructions to try to get Bronzehill on his side. And while the council had already sided with him without much effort from the clergy, that wasn't good enough for her. She saw no reason why the Archon's instructions didn't simply mean not to take over the government herself.

 BRZ_grover_coronation.1.d:0 "Grover had never been one to take his position for granted, not the sacrifices that had brought him there. He was the inheritor of a legacy unlike any other in all of Griffonia, and in his family's wake greatness and tragedy had followed in equal amounts. They had led the griffons to greatness, and they had watched it crumble.\n\nWhat did you even do with a legacy that heavy? Millions upon millions looked to you for guidance, as they had for centuries at this point. What did you do with something like that?\n\nGrover had thought a lot about this, and in the end he had come up with an answer: you remembered. You remembered all those who had come before you, who had believed and who had bled to put you where you were. An Emperor was nothing without loyal subjects, and the emperor who betrayed that loyalty undermined the foundation of his power. You were their hope, and their choice, and you needed to remember that.\n\nAs the crown was placed on his head and he rose up, turning to face the watching crowds, he remembered. He remembered the chaos after his father's death, and how those he thought had been his friends had schemed to seize power for themselves. He remembered how along amongst all the creatures of the empire, the decendants of those escaped slaves that his ancestor had given a home had come for him. He remembered how they had battered down the gates of the palace, swept all opposition before him and rescued him.\n\nHe saw their faces among the crowd, cheering and weeping with joy, and as he raised his claw to wave at those who had taken him to this point, he couldn't help but smile."

And with the current shift in the political sphere, there is no certainty what wind this message brings with it. It's time to face the demons and meet them face to face.\n\nThe Empire has extended its paw towards us, seeking a reunion from our side. [From.GetNameDef] must decide, bend the knee to the Empire to save their skins and to forge its new glory, or to stay away and build our own future in their shadow. The Empire seems impatient, our decision must be swift, for our future and our safety."

 bronzehill_revenge.1.t:0 "The End of a Lineage"
 bronzehill_revenge.1.d:0 "Count Ignatius had struggled to keep it together for weeks now, ever since the news of the Emperor's death had torn his world apart, and he sat listlessly behind his desk, shuffling papers back and forth when the messenger came storming in through the door, a telegram in his hand and gasping, as if he had been running all the way here.\n\n"Sir... sir..." he panted, holding out the Telegram. "News from Griffenheim... someone... someone..." the dog couldn't say more and Ignatous slowly took the letter, staring at the short message. He blinked, unable to understand the words at first. He read it over and over, as if it was written in a different language, but soon the paper fell from his paw. A... a coup? And the crown prince had been...\n\nHe unsteadily stood up, stumbling away form his desk.It couldn't be, that letter had to be wrong... it couldn't be! Not that too! Not that too! He screamed, howling in despair as he slammed his paws against the wall, pounding it furiously as he slowly sank down to his knees, whining incoherently. He didn't even comprehend what was going on as two guards came into the room, pulling him away from the wall as he kept slamming his now bleeding paws into it, nor could he understand them when they tried to reach through to him.\n\nIn the end, Count Ignatius was dragged out of his office and brought to the hospital, even as the news spread from the palace to the city and from the city to the county. Not enough that the emperor was dead, someone had murdered his son as well. The lineage of Grover, their savior, was gone, it was snuffed out, and in its place the military had taken over in Griffenheim."
 bronzehill_revenge.1.a:0 "Wh... What do we do? What do we do now?"

 bronzehill_revenge.2.t:0 "The Call to Action"
 bronzehill_revenge.2.d:0 "Count Ignatius is out of action, having been institutionalised for his own safety, and though every dog in the nation admires the love he held for the emperor, the time has come for action instead of sorrow. The murderous rat that took little Grover's life still nests in Griffenheim, and the dogs of Bronzehill can either cower in grief, or they can roar in anger.\n\nThree dogs have risen to speak to the people, offering them consolation and purpose in these dark hours. The first of them is Winston Copperhill, a highly respected noble and former officer in the Emperor's Hussars. The old dog has spoken of how the dogs of Bronzehill are not alone in their grief, and that griffons all around the nation are crying with them, but that in this darkest of hours it is up to the dogs to remember that they are part of a family reaching beyond the peaks of Bronzehill, and that as justice shall be wrought upon the murderous traitor, it must be done in unison with the Griffons.\n\nMeanwhile, Rufus Loudbark has spoken much more angrily. He has not shown respect for Bronzehill's imperial allies as much as he has been actively hostile. The time has come for the dogs to be the warriors they were meant to be and - if need be - drown Griffenheim in blood if that is what it takes to catch the murderous vermin who took the emperor from them. Not continuing to work alongside the old, failed regime, but to purify it themselves if need be\n\nLastly, many are listening to Kimball Barking-Sun, a radical socialist that dismisses Copperhill's talk of cooperation and instead claims that the death of Grover is proof of the Griffons' failure to protect the family of the Great Leader that brought them freedom and safety. There cannot be any waiting for the griffons - the very ones who failed Grover - to come around, and instead the Dogs must surge forth as one paw, one heart and one soul. Though the Grover lineage is dead, its memory mustn't follow it, and the dogs are the only ones who can achieve this."
 bronzehill_revenge.2.a:0 "As Copperhill says, we must stand united!"
 bronzehill_revenge.2.b:0 "Loudbark is right, blood for blood!"
 bronzehill_revenge.2.c:0 "Comrade Barking-Sun speaks the truth!"

 bronzehill_revenge.3.t:0 "Calling upon the Griffons"
 bronzehill_revenge.3.d:0 "With the political upheaval in the nation, the local griffons have been as upset and unruly as any dog has. With the Count broken from grief they are half fearing a civil war breaking out in Bronzehill, and several prominent industrialists have begun making efforts to move their assets to safety. This could potentially harm Bronzehill's economy at a time where it cannot afford it, and each of the three voices that have risen to speak for the dogs are trying to handle the situation.\n\nWinston Copperhill is planning to address the griffons specifically over the radio, calling for unity in these dark hours and speaking of how the dogs are not ones to abandon their allies when the hour gets dark. Unity is a fragile thing, after all, and the dogs must walk softly right now.\n\nIn the other end, Loudbark calls the griffons' actions as he sees them - treason - and has said that the country should be rallied and make sure that the industrialists understand just how serious the dogs will take it if they run away with their tails between their legs. If they insist on leaving, then they should know that they will be dealt with as traitors usually are\n\nKimball Barking-Sun says that they can leave if they want to, but that their wealth and assets will be frozen and used by Bronzehill for the Cause. The businessgriffs don't matter right now, remembering the Great Leader does, and that when all of the means of productions are brought under the dogs' banner, then a few hundred griffs can leave if they so please."
 bronzehill_revenge.3.a:0 "Copperhill's staunch rhetoric will calm them."
 bronzehill_revenge.3.b:0 "Loudbark is brutal, but effective."
 bronzehill_revenge.3.c:0 "Comrade Barking-Sun is right, seize their assets!"

 bronzehill_revenge.4.t:0 "Bronzehill Howls for Vengeance"
 bronzehill_revenge.4.d:0 "The situation in Bronzehill has stabilised enough that the power vacuum can finally be addressed. While our good Count is still a broken shadow of a dog, barely able to even speak, a new ruler must be chosen for the nation. The question is just how the nation shall proceed.\n\nWinston Copperhill has spoken to the nation, saying that "The dogs of Bronzehill as well as the griffons of all these venerated and loyal fiefdoms, linked together in their cause and and in their need, will defend to the death the Herzland from Dawnfeather's aggression, aiding each other like good comrades to the utmost of their strength."\n\nLoudbark has publicly denounced Copperhill's words, saying that if the old regime of Bronzehill had not been so complacent, this situation never would have arisen. Rather, the answer lies in tearing down the order that failed the emperor. This cruel world slew even an innocent child like Grover VI, and the rot must be torn up by its roots, come what may and no matter the cost.\n\nMeanwhile, Kimball Barking-Sun is still speaking out, dismissing Copperhill as a lapdog and Loudbark as a wild animal. The Grovers' legacy uplifted them and changed them forever. In all ways, the generosity of the Grovers remade them as a people, yet both his opponents seem to stuck in conflating the Grovers and the griffons. Grover VI is the rightful leader, dead or not, and the legacy the Great Leader shall be remembered to the end of the world, but claiming that in order to do so they must cooperate with the griffons is a false dichotomy. The dogs shall not forget, but neither will they put their prosperity or welfare in the hands of those who prefer to exploit them."

 bronzehill_revenge.5.d:0 "After much planning, the operation was put into action with approval from Copperhill and the Freikorps of the Empire revolted against the tyrannical Lord Protector. Freikorps units soon mobilised from the shadows and stormed various outposts and garrison bases throughout the central lands. They even stormed one of the bases in Griffenheim and from our reports, have shaken Imperial High command who expected pure loyalty from soldiers that have been both fearful and resentful. They should've known that relying only on fear to keep soldiers in line makes for a much weaker army versus our loyal and fierce hounds fighting for the Empire. Let's hope they give them hell."

Soon after, the dogs under Copperhill have officially transfered provisional administration of the capital to the Duchess for her to set up her new government as soon to be Empress. The handover was not without a small concern as Copperhill expressed that as long as the Duchess was fair and not tyrannical, they will fight for her till they end. Duchess received the words with gratitude and expressed that she will remain faithful to little Grover's memory. With the handover achieved, it's up to the Duchess to bring peace and familiarity back to her subjects."

 bronzehill_tomb.1.t:0 "The Demolitions"
 bronzehill_tomb.1.d:0 "Griffenheim was a hollow city. For what purpose could this city even exist if it was not hosting the Emperor? It was hollow and undeserving, and the dogs had set about their labours with fervour and efficiency, tearing down city block after city block. Residential areas, government buildings, noble palaces, even temples. It mattered not what stood in their path: all would be torn down to make way for the only thing that the dogs could actually give to the Emperor: a dignified resting place.\n\nMany griffons protested, some even tried to defend their estates, but the dogs were not willing to play games with these and drove them out by violence if threats did not suffice. Griffenheim was already sullied with the death of the Emperor, and they would not allow its selfish citizens to further dishonour the emperor."

 bronzehill_tomb.2.t:0 "The Mausoleum"
 bronzehill_tomb.2.d:0 "Despite the grief and anger felt by all dogs alike, the location for the Mausoleum has been chosen. It is only natural that his Majesty deserves only the best. It is the last thing that could be done to enshrine his memory. The best architects were asked to spearhead this colossal project. Many designs had been submitted but finally, after many days of searching, we have found the only design suitable for the place of his Majesty's final rest.\nThe final design showed large, square-like building. With three floors in total, each smaller than the previous, in size. Each level could be made from nothing less than a shiniest white marble. On top of the third and last floor was a spherical roof with a statue of his Majesty on top. Overall stairs-like appearance were to symbolize his Majesty's journey to the heavens and the spherical roof symbolises the paradise where Boreas and his ancestors await him. White marble symbolises his Majesty's purity and innocence.\nThe insides of the mausoleum were divided into three parts. First, the area dedicated to the visitors, divided from the next area by a wall. From there, the stairs lead to the second floor, which had a large glass floor protected from stepping on by railings at the edges. This area was dedicated as the observation room, symbols of the three temples were placed there too. Finally, from here, the visiting grievers could gaze through the floor to the third area. The third area had been sealed away to protect his Majesty's embalmed body. The Imperial crown and his closest possessions had been buried with him in there, along with the treasures and gifts from his people. And legend goes that any creature who dares disturb his sleep will meet a terrible fate..."

 bronzehill_tomb.3.t:0 "The Avenue of Tears"
 bronzehill_tomb.3.d:0 "Leading up to the massive memorial from the northern edge of the city, the dogs constructed a massive broad road they dubbed the Avenue of Tears. It was meant to put any being who walked its length into a sombre and contemplative mood. The fine stone avenue was flanked on both sides with still water ponds. Across the pond, war memorials recounted the names of all who died to avenge the Great Teacher. The road got narrower the closer it got to the Mausoleum, emphasising the size of the structure. Those who visited the monument would walk the Avenue of Tears in silence, only sobbing as they approached the Imperial monument."

 bronzehill_tomb.4.t:0 "The Eternal Flame"
 bronzehill_tomb.4.d:0 "Towering high above the giant memorial, atop a pillar of white marble, six massive dog statues, cast in bronze and arranged in a circle, carried a brazier almost ten meters across. The dogs were each sculpted as prime specimen of the loyal diamond dogs who had avenged the Emperor, and their muscles could be seen straining as they carried on their backs the eternal flame of sorrow, which lit up the mausoleum and gardens below.\n\nFilled with crystals collected from the deepest and richest mines in Bronzehill, the flame shone a pure white - as pure as the Emperor that had died due to the failings of the Empire that was supposed to save him. Burning without smoke and without a need for fuel, this eternal light would forever shine in pale imitation of the righteousness and virtue lost on that fateful day."

 bronzehill_tomb.5.t:0 "The Memorial Gardens"
 bronzehill_tomb.5.d:0 "Encircling the Mausoleum, for several hundred yards, lay the memorial gardens. Around the final resting place of the Great Teacher himself, flowers from all over the Empire and the realms around them were planted around, silently commemorating the last of the Emperors that gave them so much. As the statues and the avenue spoke a memory of stone to the Great Teacher, so did the flowers in the garden. Those that deviated from the Avenue of Tears would find the final resting places of the Righteous Sixty. Those sixty influential figures that sook to eliminate the tyrant before he could kill the Great Teacher or those that fought in his name in the immediate aftermath. Smaller gardens placed around, all bearing their own names. Eros the Seventeenth. Freiherr von Leuterbach. Graf von Thäler. All those who died in the attempt to stop the tyrant, or who died in the name of the Great Teacher. And all of them were angled towards the griffon that they served in life, as they shall serve in death."

 bronzehill_tomb.6.t:0 "The Statues"
 bronzehill_tomb.6.d:0 "A constant feature throughout the entire memorial were the statues. At the entrance two giant statues - one griffon and one dog - crossing their blades over the pathway in, their faces set in silent grief as they welcomed the mourners to the area. Further in, even more statues lined the roads in the shape of heavily armoured and armed knights who would for eternity guard the path to the grave, all in all over two hundred of them. Finally, twelve giant statues cast to resemble the great heroes of the Empire, throughout it history, were placed in a circle around the grave itself, so that the Emperor would forever be surrounded by the faithful."

 bronzehill_tomb.7.d:0 "The walls inside the Mausoleum were covered in frescoes depicting different stages of our Emperor’s glorious life. Through his lifespan, his subjects remained loyal to his decree, which was infallible and divine in its nature. These murals were meant to represent what place the Emperor took in his Empire’s life, omnipresent and renowned. Bronzehill sent their best artists to enrich the Emperor’s final resting place with the art that came from the soul of our country. But no clay and paint could truly reflect the absolute empyrean luminescence that the Emperor brought upon our lands. May he rest in peace, knowing that his legacy is not forgotten."

It had taken a long time, and many workers had perished during it, sacrificing themselves for the eternal glory of the Emperor. None were forgotten and their names were carved into the stone of the foundations. Now that the work had been finished, it was finally time for the ceremony. The funeral of the Emperor.\n\nWhen the day arrived, the entire city slowed to a standstill. It was a public holiday all across Herzland, and tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of citizens had arrived to take part in the proceedings. Soon the streets were filled to the brim with griffons and diamond dogs, and almost every single one of them carried a candle, lit in remembrance of the Emperor. The citizens them solemnly and quietly marched to the center of the city, towards the vast memorial complex. There, countless soldiers of the new Imperial Army stood, immobile like statues, facing the mausoleum. The citizens gathered behind them and around them and waited.\n\nThe main funeral procession then departed the Imperial Palace. The path was lined with candle-holding spectators as the thousands of Imperial servants, diamond dogs, soldiers and others escorted the Emperor's coffin, chanting sorrowful religious songs. At the head of the column was Kimball himself, his head hung low in sorrow. All of them were wearing black clothes.\n\nThe procession proceeded towards the mausoleum itself. The huge crowd watched in complete silence as the coffin was carried by Imperial Knights inside the darkness of the tomb-complex itself. Soon the knights returned without the coffin, and a hundred diamond dogs pushed a gigantic stone slab to seal the tomb for all eternity. There was a loud thump, and then complete, harrowing silence."

From inside a small side-room... the room of the now departed little prince, Copperhill saw the Duchess of Strawberry come walking out.He could not help but notice that she cut a splendid figure despite all the sorrows that lay on her shoulders, and he bowed his head before her\n\n"It is left just as I remember it," the Duchess said. "Even after all this time... the room is barely touched."\n\n"It takes a strong heart to come face to face with one's crimes," Copperhill commented, a low, guttural growl rising from him without intending it.

Winston Copperhill is first child of Lord Rover Copperhill and a member of the prestigious Copperhill family. He grew up as a member of Bronzehill’s elite during the peaceful reign of Emperor Grover IV. He was one of a few Diamond Dogs who went to the military academy in Helheim and was commissioned as a Leutnant in 966.\n\nAfter a time as a member of the Imperial Guard, he was granted a seat on the Bronze Council in 971 and was a close advisor to the Count. He was often controversial with his desire for social reform and his support of local Bronzehill businesses over Imperial ones. He was a founding member of the Harmonic Conservative Party and sort to bring greater representation of the common hound into the Bronze Council.\n\nDuring the Republican Uprising he was temporary promoted to Oberstleutnant, although did not participate in the fight to restore the Emperor to the throne. The event however convinced him that the only way to ensure the safety of the Emperor is to make Bronzehill strong and ready to fight. A rallying call that has put him at odds with many even in his own party. But his stubbornness and oratory talent have kept him at the forefront of politics.\n\n§YPortrait By:§! Flake"

NLR_p_labour_desc:0 "Despite out fiscal situation not being the greatest at the moment we shouldn't be forcing Ponies to work. Provided we will need to pay them for their services and that might still put a lot of preasure on our economy, but at least there won't be any unrest about it"

lunas.19.t:0 "Испытание лоялистов"
lunas.19.d:0 "Селестия была изгнана, однако мы захватили большенство их лидеров и генералов. Мы могли бы просто изгнать их и дело с концом, но к сожалению других у нас нету, а это приведет к слабому контролю над страной. У нас не остаётся выбора, кроме как подвергнуть их испытаниям."
lunas.19.a:0 "Легче уж просто расстрелять их."
lunas.20.t:0 "Судьба командира Фастклипа."
lunas.20.d:0 "Командир Фастклип, когда-то сержант в Вондерболтах, упорно пробивался через ранги, пока не добился поста их генерала. К несчастью для него, командующим он стал незадолго до нашего восстания. Из всего генеральского состава он самый ''спорный'' притендент, так что легче было бы просто прибить его, однако он довольно смелый малый и возможно у нас выйдет убедить его стать нашим генералом."
lunas.20.a:0 "Не жалейте патронов"
lunas.20.b:0 "Выдайте ему погоны"
lunas.21.t:0 "Судьба командира Виплеша"
lunas.21.d:0 "Командир Виплеш, отставной Вондерболт и один из самых выдающихся Эквестрийских офицеров. Хоть он и не особо знаменит, он и не неизвестен, к счастью нашим юристам уже удалось повесить на него пару военных приступлений, и конечно же стандартное обвинение в государственной измене. Однако его ''приступлений'' недостаточно, чтобы оправдать казнь, так что нам придется либо посадить его, либо сослать."
lunas.21.a:0 "Заприте его"
lunas.21.b:0 "Сошлите его куда подальше"
lunas.22.t:0 "Судьба Соарина"
lunas.22.d:0 "Соарин чуть ли не самый популярный генерал Лоялистов, в основном благодаря его карьере в Вандерболтах. Однако он отклонил все наши предложения присоединиться к нам. Таким образом, что мы с ним не сделали с ним, в любом случае это кого-то расстроит."
lunas.22.a:0 "Популярен он или нет, пред висилицей все одинаковы"
lunas.22.b:0 "Пусть подышит горным воздухом в ЯкЯкистане в момент ссылки"
lunas.22.c:0 "Заприте его и выбросите ключ"
lunas.23.t:0 "Судьба принца Блюблада"
lunas.23.d:0 "Голубая кровь, что существовала до гражданской войны сейчас ничего не значит пред троном её величества. Ответственность и стресс заставили его взглянуть правде в глаза, Более не тот сопливый нытик стоит пред нами, а настоящий боец и герой войны, но самое главное, он племянник её величества... На неоднократные попытки убедить его присоединиться к нам мы получали отказ, так что у нас не остается другого выбора... Мы должны либо казнить его, либо сослать."
lunas.23.a:0 "Сослать..."
lunas.23.b:0 "Да пристрелите его и дело с концом, семья или нет, он по прежнему предатель"
lunas.24.t:0 "Испытания окончены"
lunas.24.d:0 "С приговором Блублада ''Селестианский суд'' окончен, а значит настало время для укрепления нашего правления."
lunas.24.a:0 "Возвращаемся дело"
lunas.25.t:0 "Лунный террор"
lunas.25.d:0 "Ваше Высочество, мы заметили. что некоторые из наших военных проявляют явную ненависть к нашим противникам. Хоть это и не так плохо само по себе, но оно приводит к приступлениям на почве этой неновисти, как против военнопленных, так и против гражданских лиц, что попадают под наше влияние с захваченых регионов. Чем дольше продолжается эта война, тем схуже чувствуют себя наши бойцы и срываются на населении захваченых территорий."
lunas.25.a:0 "Война это война, ничего с этим не сделаешь"
lunas.28.t:0 "Ситуация на юге"
lunas.28.d:0 "Похоже, что оставшиеся нам верные солдаты на юго-востоке сумели захватить его для нашей славной империи! Это безусловно радостные вести, но нам стоит подумать о награждении Командующего Стар Вирла автономией за ее подвиг?"
lunas.28.a:0 "Назначить Командующего Стар Вирла Генерал-Губернатором Юго-Восточным Округом"
lunas.28.b:0 "Они выполнили свою задачу, пора интегрировать их в Империю."
lunas.29.t:0 "Столица."
lunas.29.d:0 "Теперь, когда мы контролируем всю Эквестрию, нам следует выбрать столицу. На выбор у нас есть все самые большие города страны. Или мы оставим столицу на юге, где она будет в безопасности?"
lunas.29.a:0 "Кантерлот, сердце Эквестрии."
lunas.29.b:0 "Мэйнхеттен, крупнейший город!"

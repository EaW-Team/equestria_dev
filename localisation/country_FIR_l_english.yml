FIR_shinespark:0 "Shinespark Returns From Exile"
FIR_shinespark_desc:0 "The notorious rogue mage, Shinespark, has returned from exile in the North. Shinespark has spent the intervening time studying magic of the foulest and darkest kind, and has attracted a cadre of disciples devoted to her ideas of unicorn supremacy. Bloody rebellion is all but certain."
FIR_harmony_wins:0 "A Victory For Harmony"
FIR_harmony_wins_desc:0 "After a short but bitter war, Shinespark's forces have been routed, and she has been captured. The Grand Elder will soon decide her fate, but for now, peace returns to the land."
FIR_shinespark_wins:0 "A Victory For Shinespark"
FIR_shinespark_wins_desc:0 "The war was short, but bloody. Shinespark's loyalists overpowered the Elder's troops and have captured all village leadership. The fate of the people now lies in the capable hooves of Shinespark. All hail our great leader!"
FIR_shinespark_trial:0 "Shinespark's Trial"
FIR_shinespark_trial_desc:0 "Shinespark has been captured, and brought before the whole people of Firtree. In front of all, the Elder pronounces his judgment - that her sins are scarlet, and that the only recompense possible for such grave evil is death."
FIR_promote_harmony:0 "Promote Harmony"
FIR_promote_harmony_desc:0 "Shinespark's poisonous ideology has created a terrible rift in our society. By trying to turn unicorns and non-magic users against each other, she has inflicted deep wounds on our society. We must be better than she would have been. We must rebuild the harmony of our people, and heal this rift."
FIR_rebuild_villages:0 "Rebuild the Villages"
FIR_rebuild_villages_desc:0 "The fighting in the recent war has taken a brutal toll on the villages of Firtrees. Loyalist warriors and Golden-Horns alike raided and seized supplies from farmers, and engaged in brutal reprisals against those perceived to be helping the other side. We must undo this damage."
FIR_suppress_magic:0 "Clamp Down On Magic"
FIR_suppress_magic_desc:0 "Shinespark's actions have proven that magic is far too dangerous for ponies to be allowed to practice it freely. We must ban books on magic and strictly forbid unicorns to use it, except within very specific limits."
FIR_oaths:0 "The Oaths Of Loyalty"
FIR_oaths_desc:0 "Shinespark was able to gain substantial support even among non-unicorns, because the local chiefs were so independent, and possessed of such little loyalty to the people as a whole that they were willing to put their own gain ahead of their people's. The village leaders and their armies to take oaths of loyalty to the Grand Elder, in order to prevent another such revolt."
FIR_orphans_and_widows:0 "The Orphans and Widows of War"
FIR_orphans_and_widows_desc:0 "The war, though short, was very brutal, and many young stallions will never return to their families. We must provide for the widows and orphans made by the war, so that their sorrow may be less."

FIR_unicorn_paramilitaries:0 "Unicorn Paramilitaries"
FIR_unicorn_paramilitaries_desc:0 "The Grand Elder's forces may have surrendered, but Shinespark's power is not yet entirely secure. We cannot rely on the village chieftains and their warriors - we must establish a group of unicorn soldiers that are loyal to Shinespark, and to her alone, to ensure that her will is enforced."
FIR_magocracy:0 "Establish Magocratic System"
FIR_magocracy_desc:0 "It is obvious from the nature of things that those who wield magic are superior to those who do not. The idea of anyone other than magic users ruling society is laughably absurd - this is the doctrine of Shinespark, and we will restructure our society around it."
FIR_hunt_down_rebels:0 "Hunt Down Rebels"
FIR_hunt_down_rebels_desc:0 "Though the Grand Elder's forces have been defeated, many ponies resent our rule and struggle against us in secret, both violently and non-violently. We cannot allow such disobedience - the dissenters must be purged."
FIR_slave_soldiers:0 "Slave Soldiers"
FIR_slave_soldiers_desc:0 "While unicorns will always be the heart and soul of our forces, we realise that there simply are not enough of them to comprise our entire army. We must, begrudgingly, allow our slaves to serve as frontline warriors, to shield our real troops. Of course, we will only give them magically-created weapons, so that we can take them away at a moment's notice..."
FIR_caste_system:0 "Caste System"
FIR_caste_system_desc:0 "A necessary corollary of our belief in the superiority of mages is that society should be properly ordered to recognise this truth. We will establish a social caste system, with powerful unicorns at the top, followed by lesser unicorns, then loyal non-mages, then the untrustworthy at the bottom as slaves."
FIR_pro_unicorn_propaganda:0 "Pro-Unicorn Propaganda"
FIR_pro_unicorn_propaganda_desc:0 "It seems that some of our subjects still do not see the benefits of our magically-ordered society. We should properly distribute correct information to ensure that they come to understand the righteousness of our society."
FIR_magocracy_rises:0 "The Magocracy Rises"
FIR_magocracy_rises_desc:0 "At last, our rule has been solidified. Those who oppose us dare not do so openly, and the number of genuine Golden-Horns supporters grows day by day. At last, we can turn our eyes away from internal matters and deal with the outside world."
FIR_isolation:0 "Isolationist Policy"
FIR_isolation_desc:0 "We have decided that external influence can only be a bad thing for our country. We will close our borders, trying to keep out all corrupting presences."
FIR_looking_outwards:0 "Looking Outwards"
FIR_looking_outwards_desc:0 "We can no longer afford to ignore the world beyond our borders, however much we might want to. External forces are going to come looking for us, whether we look for them or not, and it's always better to be prepared than taken unawares."
FIR_harmony_isolation:0 "A Strong and Gentle Ruler"
FIR_harmony_isolation_desc:0 "The Grand Elder's wisdom has seen us through many hardships. Why would we ever wish to elect anyone else? Why would we throw away our prosperity and dispose ourselves of our protector? We should crown the Grand Elder as King of Firtrees, to rule and protect us forevermore!"
FIR_fascist_isolation:0 "Perfect Our Magic"
FIR_fascist_isolation_desc:0 "Shinespark is not interested in war and conquest - all she cares about is power, and the study of magic. We should isolate ourselves behind magical barriers, so that we can perfect our society and advance our study of the magical arts."
FIR_harmony_outwards:0 "Dealing with our Neighbours"
FIR_harmony_outwards_desc:0 "Our neighbours, the villages of Farbrook and Watertowns, should be our first port of call. We must ensure that they are not a threat to us, one way or the other."
FIR_fascist_outwards:0 "We Need More Slaves"
FIR_fascist_outwards_desc:0 "Shinespark wants more power, and more power means more magic, and more magic means more energy, and more energy means more slaves. We must crush the nearby villages, and take what is theirs!"
FIR_farbrook_friends:0 "Befriend Farbrook"
FIR_farbrook_friends_desc:0 "The hillponies of Farbrook have always been good to us. We should reach out to them, to establish more formal relations, helping to mutually ensure the safety of both our peoples."
FIR_crush_farbrook:0 "End the Threat From Farbrook"
FIR_crush_farbrook_desc:0 "Farbrook and Firtree have had a generally good relationship over the years, but it has soured remarkably in the last few years. A new, radical government has taken power, and gazes upon our lands with greedy eyes. We must strike them first, to protect our freedom."
FIR_watertown_friends:0 "Peace With The Commune"
FIR_watertown_friends_desc:0 "The northeren ponies of Watertowns have always been friendly and peaceful. There is no need for there to be violence or mistrust between us. Let's be friends!"
FIR_crush_watertown:0 "The Commune Cannot Be Trusted"
FIR_crush_watertown_desc:0 "The ponies of Watertown have traditionally been peaceful, but that has changed in recent years. A more bellicose, aggressive leader has taken charge, and poses a clear threat to our safety. This cannot be allowed to stand - the Commune must be brought to order."
FIR_coltstream:0 "Sign The Treaty of Coltstream"
FIR_coltstream_desc:0 "The River Federation is prosperous, wealthy, and safe. It would be foolish to continue to ignore those who wish to help us, when we could both be profiting! We shall apply for membership in the River Coalition, by signing the Treaty of Coltstream."
FIR_coltstream_signed_already:0 "Increase Ties With The River Federation"
FIR_coltstream_signed_already_desc:0 "Now that we are a member of the River Federation, it would be to our benefit to draw closer to them, signing trade pacts and intermingling our cultures. The closer we are united to each other, the better off we are."

FIR_riv_relations_desc:0 "[Root.coltstreamFocusDesc]"
FIR_spiritual_schools:0 "Spiritual Schools"

FIR_guardians_of_peace:0 "Guardians of Peace"
FIR_guardians_of_peace_desc:0 "Isolation is useless if we are unable to enforce it. The Great King has taken the most loyal warriors from each tribe, and proclaimed them as the Guardians - a group dedicated both to the defence of the realm from external threats and internal subversives like the Golden-Horns."
FIR_inward_perfection:0 "Inward Perfection"
FIR_inward_perfection_desc:0 "Now that we are finally safe and stable, we can turn our attention away from the world, and instead focus on more important, inner issues. We will sit and meditate, spending time in contact with the Spirits, and thereby transcend the petty concerns of this mortal world."
FIR_further_study:0 "Study The Dark Arts"
FIR_further_study_desc:0 "With the greater resources of the villages available to us, we now have the liberty to study deeply into the lore of power that has so foolishly been forbidden. In particular, it is said that the elders of the tribes contain secret knowledge that they are forbidden to tell anyone. This could be useful to us..."
FIR_dig_for_crystals:0 "Dig For Crystals"
FIR_dig_for_crystals_desc:0 "Magical Crystals are a far more effective, if rare, source of power than living beings. We have discovered a deposit of these rare crystals beneath Bonedrift, and we will get them no matter the cost."

FIR_pilgrimage_magehold_desc:0 "During her travels, Shinespark attempted to enlist in the Necromancer's College at Magehold, but was refused entry, because the Cabals thought that she had nothing to offer them. Now that she rules Firtrees, she possesses wealth and subjects, gold and jewels, that may be able to change their minds..."
FIR_raids:0 "Slave Raids"
FIR_raids_desc:0 "We cannot grow in power without more sources of magic, and for that, we're going to need more ponies. Waiting for new ponies to be born and grow up is much too slow - we will send warriors off to capture ponies from the lands of our neighbours."
FIR_capture_scholars:0 "Capture Scholars"
FIR_capture_scholars_desc:0 "While most of the ponies we capture are just menial laborers, occasionally we find a well-educated pony or griffon among them. Shinespark has ordered us to bring these to her personally, unharmed, so that they can be formed into a corps of scientists, researchers, and teachers to benefit all those who support her."
FIR_scum_and_villainy:0 "Wretched Hive"
FIR_scum_and_villainy_desc:0 "The Magocracy has grown wealthy on the backs of its conquests, and the wise rulership of Shinespark. Brigands, ne'er-do-wells, and fortune-seekers from all over Griffonia now migrate to the area, hoping to make their fortune, and the population has skyrocketed. Bonedrift, once only a small town by the world's standards, is now one of the world's most bustling hives of activity, both legal and...less legal."
FIR_great_spirit:0 "The Great Spirit Of The Woods"
FIR_great_spirit_desc:0 "After ten thousand years, at last I am free! I have taken possession of a mortal body, and have now returned to exert my influence over the mortal world. Through the voice of their dearly-beloved "Great King", these ponies will do almost anything I say! It is time for the Spirits to rise!"
FIR_advise_mortals:0 "Advise The Mortals"
FIR_advise_mortals_desc:0 "It would be inadvisable for me to be too harsh with the mortals. After all, they are weak and short-lived. Let us rule with a gentle hand, and limit ourselves to mostly advising them, rather than ordering them."
FIR_rule_mortals:0 "Rule The Mortals"
FIR_rule_mortals_desc:0 "Mortals are short-lived and weak - they cannot possibly know how best to rule themselves. I must take full control of their political life, for their own good."
FIR_agri_blessing:0 "Blessing of Bounty"

FIR_old_ways:0 "Stick with the Old Ways"
FIR_old_ways_desc:0 "Bah! We were much better off before we got involved with this modern world! We must return to our roots to find our real strength."
FIR_modernity:0 "Compromise With Modernity"
FIR_modernity_desc:0 "We cannot ignore the outside world forever. Though we may not be fond of modern machinery, it is better by far that we control the degree of mechanisation that goes on in Firtree than to simply ban it. This way, we can ensure Firtree is strong enough to resist the predations of her neighbours, while also making sure that the wildlands do not suffer overmuch."
FIR_restore_shrines:0 "Restore The Ancient Shrines"
FIR_restore_shrines_desc:0 "For centuries our ancient shrines have been neglected, as the people's connection to the Spirits has lessened. This will not do! We must restore these venerable monuments, and with them the balance between the two worlds."
FIR_divine_fury:0 "Divine Fury"
FIR_divine_fury_desc:0 "With the Shrines restored, more Spirits than ever have come close to the ponies of Firtree. With them have come Spirits of War and Zeal - ancient and powerful beings who fill our warriors with righteous fury."
FIR_controlled_modernisation:0 "Controlled Modernisation"
FIR_controlled_modernisation_desc:0 "We cannot simply ignore the modern world, but neither can we allow it to overrun Nature. We must carefully control the development of Firtree's industry, to ensure that it does what we need it to, without endangering the homes of the Spirits."
FIR_modern_arms:0 "Modern Arms"
FIR_modern_arms_desc:0 "With the modern age have come modern weapons. We should expand our controlled industrialisation plan to ensure that we can equip our mortal forces with these better weapons."
FIR_further_insight:0 "Further Insights"

FIR_avatar_rises:0 "Rise Of The Avatar"
FIR_avatar_rises_desc:0 "The Great King has changed...become something...more than he was. The Great Spirit now lives within him, and his power and understanding have both broadened immeasurably. No longer does the Great King rule Firtree - the Age of the Avatar has begun."
FIR_master_air:0 "Master The Air"
FIR_master_air_desc:0 "With the power of the Great Spirit, the Avatar has learned the ability to manipulate the very air itself. He can now create powerful gusts of wind, or divert hurricanes from their path. With this power, our soldiers will be much harder to harm with ranged weapons."
FIR_master_water:0 "Master The Waters"
FIR_master_water_desc:0 "With the power of the Great Spirit, the Avatar has learned the ability to manipulate water, be it rain, sea, lake, or stream. Gentle rains now nourish our crops whenever we need them, and never does a hostile storm come near us."

FIR_master_fire_desc:0 "With the power of the Great Spirit, the Avatar has learned the ability to manipulate fire, as well as to project it from thin air using his own life force.

FIR_master_earth:0 "Master The Earth"
FIR_master_earth_desc:0 "With the power of the Great Spirit, the Avatar has learned the ability to manipulate the very earth beneath our hooves. This has made it much easier to extract valuable materials from the ground."
FIR_avatar_insight:0 "Avatar's Insight"
FIR_avatar_insight_desc:0 "The Avatar has a preternatural connection to the Spiritual World, and has access to knowledge that is unknown even to the very wise. This knowledge they have shared with the people, and all benefit."

FIR_bandit_queen:0 "The Bandit Queen"
FIR_bandit_queen_desc:0 "Shinespark has constructed a new social order in Firtrees, with legions of raiders and criminals building little empires - all of which are subservient to her, and pay her tribute. Long live the Bandit Queen of the North!"
FIR_fresh_recruits:0 ""Fresh" Recruits"
FIR_fresh_recruits_desc:0 "Firtrees has never been a particularly large nation, and Shinespark's travels have given her the chance to see many much larger, more populous countries that could crush us at a moment's notice. Thankfully, with her new powers, we can even the odds considerably..."
FIR_work_to_the_bone:0 "Work To The Bone"
FIR_work_to_the_bone_desc:0 "While even the strongest mortal ponies need food, water, and rest, the dead need none of these. By "employing" the newly-raised within our factories, we can substantially increase the size of our economy. The mortals will complain, but they'll learn to live with it, we're sure."
FIR_raider_economy:0 "Raider Economy"
FIR_raider_economy_desc:0 "The spoils of raiding are all well and good, but we could make much better use of that wealth. By taxing some of the wealth taken by our raiders, we can reinvest it into the economy, strengthening our overall situation."
FIR_rein_in:0 "Rein In The Worst Excesses"
FIR_rein_in_desc:0 "We have adopted what could be called a "lenient" policy to banditry and pillaging within our lands, as long as they pay tribute to us and do not harm our loyalists. However, some of the more egregiously violent and wicked bandits are starting to disrupt our precious order, and are getting too big for their boots. We must organise a new army to "deal with them"."
FIR_renewed_aggression:0 "Renewed Aggression"
FIR_renewed_aggression_desc:0 "While we have focussed primarily on perfecting our magic, rather than external territorial conquest, the demands for new bodies that our model of government places on us is rather high.

FIR_secure_springs:0 "Secure The Springs"
FIR_secure_springs_desc:0 "Watertowns have always had a monopoly on the trade in their sacred springwater, which is highly-desirable. We have been stealing some of it, of course, but why take it in small amounts when you can simply take ALL of it?"

FIR_eliminate_competition_desc:0 "The bandits of Sunstriker have spent years pillaging, terrorising, and generally making life miserable for everyone in the North. That's our job! This continent isn't big enough for two bands of raiders, and we'll soon put them in their place."
FIR_great_library:0 "Build The Great Library"
FIR_great_library_desc:0 "With the enormous amount of wealth and books that Shinespark has accumulated, we are finally ready to build a Library that is unmatched among the nations of the world. This library will be so great that it will surely pass into legend in days to come!"

FIR_education_for_the_people:0 "Education For The People"
FIR_education_for_the_people_desc:0 "Our people are laughably backwards by comparison to the well-educated ponies of Wittenland or River City. We must establish a system of Federal-standard primary schools, and ensure that everypony can attend them."
FIR_develop_nation:0 "Develop The Nation"
FIR_develop_nation_desc:0 "The bustling metropolises of River City and Lake City make our little villages and towns look tiny by comparison. Now that we are a member of the Coalition, we can apply for increased industrial funding."

FIR_grand_university:0 "The Grand University"
FIR_grand_university_desc:0 "Education has come a long way, but there is still one thing we lack. We do not yet have any institutes of our own which would qualify for Coalition-certified University status. We will construct the Green Pine University in the heart of our nation, to show the world that Firtrees is a truly modern country!"
FIR_stout_hearts:0 "Stout Hearts"
FIR_stout_hearts_desc:0 "With our focus on the interior life, our people have begun to change. They were concerned primarily with their own well-being and glory, but with their new awareness of the importance of the spiritual realm, these impulses have slowly begun to fade. Now they are steady of heart and singular of purpose - they will only to preserve their way of life, and are willing to sacrifice anything to ensure its safety."
FIR_inherent_magic:0 "Develop Our Inherent Magic"
FIR_inherent_magic_desc:0 "What we normally think of as magic is the preserve only of unicorns, but all ponies have some kind of magic, though it may express itself in different ways.

FIR_farbrook_metal:0 "Farbrook Metal"

FIR_lightning_raids:0 "Lightning Raids"
FIR_lightning_raids_desc:0 "Pegasi, being able to fly, have a natural advantage in the raiding profession.

EAW_WS_FIR:0 "Firtrees - Hidden In The Woods"
EAW_WS_FIR_desc:0 "Firtrees is a small collection of villages in the North-East of the Griffonian Continent. Bonedrift, the largest village, typically dominates the affairs of the realm, but a council of each tribe's chieftain convenes once every three months to discuss matters and address problems that are too large for one village to handle.\n \nFirtrees is an isolated place, covered in deep forests. The ponies here ignore almost everything that happens outside their borders, and even the bandits of the Sunstriker Clan rarely bother to raid them, so little is there here. §RMagic is strictly regulated§!, and only members of the Sacred Order are allowed to cast spells. Any illegal spellcasting is strictly punished, by any means up to and including §Rexile§!. In the wild lands of the north, being made an exile and outlaw is tantamount to a death sentence, making this punishment doubly horrifying. While some ponies regard this as unfair, it is one of the reasons why our nation has been §Ystable§! and §Ypeaceful§! for so long.\n \nIn 1007, Firtrees still seems peaceful, but ominous rumblings can be heard. The Chieftain of the Coldmouth Clan has died with no living family members, and there is a major dispute over who will succeed him. Some mention that §YShinespark§!, his daughter, may still live, but she was §Rexiled§! years ago for advancing §Rdangerous theories§!. We were almost certain that she had died, but there have been rumblings that she may still live. If she does, then it is likely that she will §Yreturn§!, and then she will have to be §Ydealt with§!, whether peacefully or by force. Will life in Firtrees continue as normal, or change irrevocably? Only time will tell...\n \nAnd behind all of this, strange lights are seen in the Deep Woods, and strange dreams have been plaguing the seers. Is it possible that the §RForest Spirits§! have awoken?"

### EVENTS #################################
###########################################
FIR.1.t:0 "Shinespark's Return"
FIR.1.d:0 "The notorious mage, Shinespark, was exiled from Firtree for her controversial opinions about the direction of our society. We presumed that she would surely perish in the wilds, but she did not and claims to have learned much during her exile. She has even gathered a cadre of like-minded followers and has now returned to her ancestral home. Her father, the chief of the Coldmouth Tribe, had no other living relatives and with his recent death she has taken up his mantle as chief. The ponies of her Tribe have rallied around her and while she hasn’t consolidated her power in her tribe yet, it seems that we may have to listen to her opinions again at the next Clan Council."
FIR.1.a:0 "Maybe time has mellowed the insanity of her youth."
FIR.2.t:0 "Firtree Requests Federation Membership"
FIR.2.d:0 "The small tribal nation of Firtree recently requested membership into the River Federation, signalling their willingness to sign the Treaty of Coltstream and abide by all of its laws. This sudden policy move is the result of a recent period of violent unrest that have convinced Firtrees that uniting with us is the best means of protecting themselves."
FIR.2.a:0 "Welcome to our new friends!"
FIR.2.b:0 "We do not think the time is right"
FIR.3.t:0 "Our application is accepted!"
FIR.3.d:0 "Our application has been accepted. We have signed the Treaty of Coltstream, and are now a full member of the River Federation."
FIR.3.a:0 "Excellent"
FIR.4.t:0 "We have been refused"
FIR.4.d:0 "For reasons beyond our understanding, our application to join the River Federation has been rejected."
FIR.4.a:0 "Was it something we said?"
FIR.5.t:0 "Entering The Infinite"
FIR.5.d:0 "Your mind fills with mist as the ceremonial incense fills your nostrils. The world fades away as you find yourself transported to the Spirit World. Images swim before your vision, until at last you find yourself standing at a crossroads. You see three paths - one, leading into a deep forest lit with tiny, moving lights, another leading to a well, and a third tapering off into a walled castle in the far distance."
FIR.5.a:0 "Head into the Woods"
FIR.5.b:0 "Go towards the Well"
FIR.5.c:0 "Walk towards the Castle"
FIR.6.t:0 "The Forest of Lights"
FIR.6.d:0 "You follow the path into the Forest, watching as the small light flicker by. At last you come to a shrine, or altar, deep in the heart of a grove. Before you stands a great and tall spirit, one you know to be the Ancient Spirit of the Woods. It turns to you, and speaks. "You are the first mortal to have been able to reach me" it says. "Let us join together, and we will live as one. I will lend you my power, and you will lend me your aid.""
FIR.6.a:0 "The Spirit overwhelms you and takes control of your body!"
FIR.6.b:0 "You wrestle control over the Spirit and become the Avatar of the Woods!"
FIR.7.t:0 "Entering The Infinite"
FIR.7.d:0 "Your mind fills with mist as the ceremonial incense fills your nostrils. Your spiritual nature make this transition easy - this is as easy as slipping into the next room. The world fades away as you find yourself transported to the Spirit World. Images swim before your vision, until at last you find yourself standing at a crossroads. You see two paths - one leading to a well, and another tapering off into a walled castle in the far distance."
FIR.7.a:0 "Go towards the Well"
FIR.7.b:0 "Walk towards the Castle"
FIR.8.t:0 "The Well of Stars"
FIR.8.d:0 "Before you lies the Well from which the sky draws its water, the Well of Stars. Within its deep, clear waters you see bright lights burning. They seem so close, as if you could reach out and grab them..."
FIR.8.a:0 "Bring some of the Water back with you"
FIR.8.b:0 "Drink in one of the stars"
FIR.9.t:0 "The Castle of the Powers"
FIR.9.d:0 "You take the long, winding path to the Castle, and before you have even thought of it, you have arrived. You pass through the gate-house, strange, multicolored servants waving you by or ignoring you. You are stopped, suddenly, when you find yourself face to face with three great beings, seated upon thrones of oak, cherry, and yew, respectively. They introduce themselves as the Avatars of War, Vigor, and Industry, rulers of this land. They have long squabbled over which of them is greatest, and seek a neutral arbiter to decide between them. Of course, each promises a boon in exchange for your favor..." 
FIR.9.a:0 "Strength in War is the greatest virtue!"
FIR.9.b:0 "Vigor gives life and heart to all things!"
FIR.9.c:0 "Without Industry, what would ever get done?"
FIR.10.t:0 "Gathering To Depart"
FIR.10.d:0 "You have reached the limit of your magical powers - at least, your natural magical powers. Your thoughts have turned to that time, all those years ago, when you sought power from the black-robed sorcerors of Magehold. Oh, how you admired them then! But they did not want you. Now, you will go again, bringing servants, gold, and crystals of magic. This time they will listen to you."
FIR.10.a:0 "We are off!"
FIR.11.t:0 "Pilgrim's Progress - The Gates of Arcturia"
FIR.11.d:0 "You have now arrived at the first major obstacle in your journey - the Order of Arcturus. Established to keep the Dread League's influence contained within a tiny northern peninsula, they turn away any and all visitors, with the sometime-exception of those who wish to join their vigil. In your youth, you were here alone, and were able to slip by them with the aid of a little magic, but there is no way that your large party will be able to escape notice. As you approach the borders of Arcturia, a number of Griffon Knights approach you, and ask why you are come to Arcturia."
FIR.11.a:0 "Convince them that we are harmless"
FIR.11.b:0 "Use a memory-wiping spell (will cost crystals)"
FIR.11.c:0 "Subdue them with force"
FIR.12.t:0 "Pilgrim's Progress - Arcturia's Ruin"
FIR.12.d:0 "You have arrived at the southern border of what used to be the Holy Knights of Arcturus' territory. The land is scorched and blacked, as the land's new owners take little care for maintaining the border patrols. This is the land you must cross if you are to reach Magehold."
FIR.12.a:0 "Lets' get to it, then"
FIR.13.t:0 "Escaped The Guards"
FIR.13.d:0 "Thankfully, the guards seem to believe your story. You are free to go."
FIR.13.a:0 "Phew!"
FIR.14.t:0 "Not The Ponies You're Looking For"
FIR.14.d:0 "You drain one of your crystals for a power-boost. You cannot afford this to fail, or things could get ugly. As you cast your spell, the griffons start to scratch their heads, unsure of what it was they were supposed to be doing. You remind them that they were about to escort you through Arcturia - after all, it's their duty as tour guides, no? They nod enthusiastically, and you cross the border in peace."
FIR.14.a:0 "We'd better move along"
FIR.15.t:0 "The Guards Subdued"
FIR.15.d:0 "Your soldiers manage to subdue the Guards quickly, thanks to the element of surprise, but there are still more than half a dozen bodies lying on the ground. You'd better make haste through this country before word catches up with you."
FIR.15.a:0 "By the time they realise, it will be too late"
FIR.16.t:0 "Captured By The Guards"
FIR.16.d:0 "Rats! Your efforts have not succeeded. You have been captured by the guards, and your possessions confiscated."
FIR.16.a:0 "Blast!"
FIR.17.t:0 "Escaped, but at what Cost?"
FIR.17.d:0 "You have managed to escape... but the Guards are onto you, and you have had to use up one of your limited supply of crystals."
FIR.17.a:0 "It'll all be worth it in the end"
FIR.18.t:0 "Safe Passage"
FIR.18.d:0 "With the fall of the Arcturian Order, a major obstacle to your journey has been removed. The new owners of the land are far less vigilant about preventing travellers from passing through it, and nobody bothers to stop you or ask questions."
FIR.18.a:0 "Well, that's a relief"
FIR.19.t:0 "Pilgrim's Progress - Drawing The Cabal's Attention"
FIR.19.d:0 "At last, you have arrived in the bustling (?) streets of Magehold. This place is teeming with aspirant necromancers from all across the continent. While your entourage earns you more passing glances than most commoners, you still get the feeling that you are far from welcome here. You must earn an audience with the great and the powerful of Magehold if you wish to be taken onboard. How are you going to get the attention of the Cabals?"
FIR.19.a:0 "Bribe someone to get me an audience (2 crystals)"
FIR.19.b:0 "Impress them with a public display of magical talent (1 crystal)"
FIR.19.c:0 "Sneak into the Necromancer Council's meeting chambers by subterfuge"
FIR.20.t:0 "A Profitable Deal"
FIR.20.d:0 "Your acquaintance proves to be as good as his word. You are ushered quietly into a large, vast chamber, high in the tower of Magehold itself. This must be where the Dread Council meets..."
FIR.20.a:0 "Hello?"
FIR.21.t:0 "A Once-In-A-Lifetime Performance"
FIR.21.d:0 "Consuming the power of a crystal, you perform a set of impressive magical acts. You levitate several wagons, juggling them in the air. You create an illusion of a large dragon in the sky. You even wrench control of a party of skeletons away from their owner, and make them do a jig. The people are gathering round you, marvelling at your ability. At last, a gaunt pony in a black cloak appears, the crowd parting in fear as he approaches. He indicates to you that you should follow him..."
FIR.21.a:0 "That's it - I'm in!"
FIR.22.t:0 "Parlor Tricks"
FIR.22.d:0 "Despite your best efforts, the jaded ponies of Magehold seem to have seen it all before. Your little show earns no remark from anybody but the homeless."
FIR.22.a:0 "Drat and double drat!"
FIR.23.t:0 "Stealthy As A Fox"
FIR.23.d:0 "Leaving your entourage behind, you slip over walls and through patrolled corridors, teleporting yourself short distances as needed. You evade detection, eventually coming to a large pair of double doors..."
FIR.23.a:0 "This must be it!"
FIR.24.t:0 "Not Exactly As Planned"
FIR.24.d:0 "Sadly, you had not counted on the sheer magnitude of Magehold's defences. You make a good beginning, vaulting over a wall and teleporting past guards, but eventually you slam directly into a large bone golem, who captures you. You are thrown in a foul, dank dungeon."
FIR.24.a:0 "This might be something of a setback..."
FIR.25.t:0 "The Dread Council's Meeting"
FIR.25.d:0 "At last, you stand before the Dread Council. You raise your voice, and their attention turns towards the strange intruder. You plead with them to allow you to speak, and they seem divided. After much murmuring, their leader breaks the deadlock, and decides to hear what you have to say. You plead to be taught the secrets of necromancy, but they ask what you have to offer them in exchange for such power."
FIR.25.a:0 "I will offer you great wealth! See, these crystals I have brought! (Uses all remaining crystals)"
FIR.25.b:0 "Beg and Plead"
FIR.26.t:0 "Your Pilgrimage Has Failed"
FIR.26.d:0 "For whatever reason, your pilgrimage has come to an end. Though your powers will eventually help you to escape back to Firtrees, this journey is over. You will have to wait until later to try again."
FIR.26.a:0 "Next time, I swear!"
FIR.27.t:0 "The Council Relents"
FIR.27.d:0 "The Council has been persuaded. Though the vote was close, they have decided to allow you to learn the secrets of necromancy at Magehold."
FIR.27.a:0 "Finally!"
FIR.28.t:0 "A Petty Bauble"
FIR.28.d:0 "The Council has not been impressed by the wealth you have offered. You will have to throw yourself on their good will."
FIR.28.a:0 "Horseapples!"
FIR.29.t:0 "The Fighting Subsides"
FIR.29.d:0 "At last, the civil war is over. Warrior ponies who rose up to fight for their homes and for their future have eagerly lain down their arms and returned to civilian life."
FIR.29.a:0 "Hopefully they will not be needed anymore"
FIR.30.t:0 "The Warriors Rise"
FIR.30.d:0 "Shinespark has returned, and the peaceful land of Firtrees has been torn asunder by civil war. Shinespark's Golden-Horns have risen up, terrorising families and tribes into submission, while bands of warriors loyal to Elder Iorweth muster to meet their challenge."
FIR.30.a:0 "We will win this war"
FIR.31.t:0 "The Warriors Rise"
FIR.31.d:0 "Shinespark has returned, and the peaceful land of Firtrees has been torn asunder by civil war. Shinespark's Golden-Horns have risen up, terrorising families and tribes into submission, while bands of warriors loyal to Elder Iorweth muster to meet their challenge."
FIR.31.a:0 "We will win this war"
FIR.32.t:0 "The Next Clan Council"
FIR.32.d:0 "By tradition, the Clan Council meets once every three months to discuss issues affecting everypony in Firtree. However, this meeting seems set to be especially tense, as Shinespark, newly appointed Chieftess of Coldmouth, presents her reformist agenda. On her travels she has journeyed to the frozen north, the Riverlands to the south and even the Empire of the Griffons to the West. She rails against many of our traditional institutions, claiming that they are unfit to guide us through the new age. Eventually, she claims, somepony will come for us if we don’t protect ourselves. She also blames our conservatism for the fact that we are far more "backwards" than the Riverponies, despite sharing a closer border with the powerful and advanced Griffin Empire than they do."
FIR.32.a:0 "What lunacy."
FIR.33.t:0 "The First Argument - Agriculture and Industry"
FIR.33.d:0 "The first point that Shinespark and her faction have brought up is the issue of agriculture. The Mage claims that our traditional ways of growing crops will not suffice us in the modern world and that ponies and griffons elsewhere have devised ways to grow far more food far more efficiently. She also argues for the building of what she calls "industry", on the grounds that it will enable us to "produce the kind of goods a modern country needs." While most ponies didn't fully comprehend what she said, the idea of more food is certainly appealing and Shinespark has managed to gather some support for this proposal."
FIR.33.a:0 "Agree with Shinespark on this point."
FIR.33.b:0 "Insist that we stick with tradition."
FIR.34.t:0 "The Second Argument - The Army"
FIR.34.d:0 "Shinespark has been abroad for a long time and has seen the armies of the more advanced nations. She claims that our disorganised, militia-style army is ill-suited to face even the armies of the Riverponies, let alone the warlike griffons. She favours a more centralised, better-disciplined army. Many other chieftains oppose her and advocate for smaller improvements to the current system instead, as to not upset the system of clan loyalty and tribal allegiances."
FIR.34.a:0 "Shinespark's "Great Army" idea has merit."
FIR.34.b:0 "It would be better simply to reform the militia."
FIR.35.t:0 "The Final Argument - The Status of Magic"
FIR.35.d:0 "For many years now, we have been wary of magic and the ill effects that it can have on those who wield it, as well as on the community as a whole. Unicorns in our tribes are strongly discouraged from using their abilities and unless they join the Sacred Order, they are forbidden to cast any but the most basic of spells. This has kept our society safe and secure, insulated from the effects of the dark magic that leaks from the Dread Peninsula.\n\nHowever, Shinespark, being a unicorn, is adamant that this law is both cruel and counterproductive, preventing us from achieving our full potential while also punishing unicorns merely for being born in the wrong body. There is much debate - though ancient, the rule does not have unanimous support among the people and some of the chieftains nod sympathetically when she speaks of the pains it has caused her and all Firtree Unicorns. However, changing such a venerable custom would be very difficult and the Sacred Order themselves warns against doing so, for it might open us up to the seduction of evil wizardry. Indeed, some even whisper that Shinespark herself has come under the influence of such magic. . ."
FIR.35.a:0 "I agree with Shinespark. The custom does more harm than good."
FIR.35.b:0 "We cannot take such a huge risk."
FIR.36.t:0 "A Breakdown of Negotiations"
FIR.36.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, Shinespark and her supporters refused to be reasonable. We could not accept any of her demands, for to accede to even a single one would irrevocably damage the very fabric of our society. She did not take this well, storming out of the meeting and vowing that change would come to Firtree "one way or the other". There have already been reports that violence has broken out in several villages, and it seems that her supporters may be mobilising for war..."
FIR.36.a:0 "What a lunatic!"
FIR.37.t:0 "A New Order"
FIR.37.d:0 "After much debate, the Council has decided to implement each one of Shinespark's reforms. She has been elected majority leader of the Clan Council, and has assumed charge over the government. In her victory speech, Shinespark promised swift and wide-ranging reform to the archaic systems of Firtrees. However, despite the halls filling with the cheers of her supporters, the traditionalists aren't taking this well. Violence against known Golden-Horn members has already been reported, and it seems likely that the Sacred Order will refuse to accept the Council's decision."
FIR.37.a:0 "Those who stand in the way of the locomotive of progress will be crushed by it"
FIR.38.t:0 "Compromise"
FIR.38.d:0 "After debating until the depth of the night, the Council has finally come to a decision. They agree that Shinespark has some legitimate points, but will not go so far as to accept all of her demands. Shinespark, though disappointed, has stated that she will not contest the result, placing her hope in slow, peaceful change rather than violent revolution. Perhaps there is hope for peace after all?"
FIR.38.a:0 "It seems the worst is over."
FIR.39.t:0 "Civil War!"
FIR.39.d:0 "The tension has finally come to a head. The Council's complete and utter unwillingness to compromise with Shinespark has left her and her supporters desperate. Now, they feel they have no choice but armed revolt. They have risen up throughout the country, with many clans declaring their support for her and her cause. Militias have been raised, and a bloody struggle is upon us."
FIR.39.a:0 "They will not destroy our way of life!"
FIR.40.t:0 "Civil War!"
FIR.40.d:0 "Shinespark's victory in the council has angered conservative and traditionalist elements in Firtrees, and now things have come to a boiling point. Unable to accept the new status quo, armies of reactionaries have risen up, determined to defend their way of life."
FIR.40.a:0 "They will not drag us back into the past!"
FIR.41.t:0 "Triumph of Tradition"
FIR.41.d:0 "At last, it is over. Shinespark's forces have been utterly defeated, and her insane rebellion against all that we hold dear has been crushed. Though no doubt some of her supporters still linger, hidden within our own clans, they will be cowed and afraid to speak up for many a year, and we may have peace again. The Sacred Order has restored sanity and stability to us in a troubled time."
FIR.41.a:0 "She was a child, driven by madness"
FIR.42.t:0 "A Victory Terrible To Behold"
FIR.42.d:0 "Despite their utter rejection of her, Shinespark has proven herself stronger than the forces that sought to hold her back. The Golden-Horns have begun rounding up all of those who opposed their glorious leader, and peace is slowly beginning to return to Firtrees. Despite this, Shinespark's behavior has begun to trouble some of those dearest to her. The particularly harsh and cruel methods of execution demanded of the treasonous soldiers was bad enough, but now she has begun to lash out even at her closest friends and confidantes. She has become paranoid, convinced that everyone is capable and willing to betray her to the Reactionaries. As her actions grow wilder, many worry for the fate of Firtrees. Where is the idealistic young leader that advocated so passionately for change? Whispers begin to circulate - some speak of the mental strain caused by the civil war, others say that her lover tried to personally betray her to the enemy, while yet others claim that the Sacred Order placed a curse of madness on her with their ding breath. Dark times may be ahead..."
FIR.42.a:0 "Perhaps she just got out of the wrong side of the bed"
FIR.44.t:0 "Whispers"
FIR.44.d:0 "Iorweth has been feeling odd of late. He regrets the lamentable business with Shinespark, and his sorrow at what has happened to his people is great. But despite this, his grief has seemed...distant, somehow. As if it were happening to another pony, with him merely watching it from behind a screen. Ever more frequently, he finds himself being called to. Whispers, subtle hints and movements, little gestures that draw his attention, but turn out to have been nothing of signifigance. He is starting to think that he is going mad, but perhaps...perhaps it is something different. He finds that, within the Temples, the feeling is not so severe. Perhaps if he meditates and prays, the meaning of this will make itself clear to him..."
FIR.44.a:0 "It may simply go away in time"
FIR.45.t:0 "The Deep Wood"
FIR.45.d:0 "Shinespark's dreams have been troubled of late. The trauma of the civil war has left her scarred, and she hardly understands her own feelings anymore. She has gained what she thought she wanted, but she has lost so much in the process that she is beginning to doubt the usefulness of it all. She has almost forgotten the reasons why she returned to Firtrees at all. Her supporters (those few who she still trusts) remind her that it was to bring change, but she can scarcely recall what change looks like anymore. Her days are filled with fog that clouds her brain, and her nights are filled with strange sights, things that awe and terrify at once. Was the Curse of the Sacred Order real after all? She no longer knows. All that she knows is that every night, a thought suggests itself to her - there is a way to make all of this stop, if only you had more power..."
FIR.45.a:0 "Power will bring an end to this"
FIR.46.t:0 "Visions Abate"
FIR.46.d:0 "Iorweth has been feeling better recently. The terrible visions and distractions that used to plague him have gotten better, and the worst of them have stopped. He no longer hears quiet voices tempting him to enter the "Castle In The Woods", or to throw himself off the side of a high mountain. It seems as if he has gotten past this traumatic period, at last."

FIR.47.t:0 "Practical Elementalism"
FIR.47.desc:0 "Ever since Iorweth absorbed the power of the Spirit, he has changed. The elements themselves respond to his call, and they do whatever he asks of them. This has proven extremely useful in solving domestic problems, for there are few issues that cannot be resolved through judicious application of elementalism.\n \nJust yesterday, for instance, a nest of dire badgers has taken up residence just outside the village of Endlessen. These vicious animals can grow up to seven feet long and can weigh up to 500 pounds, and even the warriors of Endlessen have proven unable to shunt them. The ponies call upon Iorweth, as their leader, to do something, and with his new power, he can solve this problem in ways nobody could have imagined..."

FIR.48.t:0 "What the Hell?!"
FIR.48.d:0 "Farmers in Wingenburg awoke this morning to a bizarre and horrifying sight - dozens of Dire Badgers, falling from the sky! Many died when they hit the ground, but not all. Given that Dire Badgers can grow up to seven feet long and weigh as much as a small bear, this was a shocking sight. Those beasts which survived immediately set about venting their anger on anything they could get their claws on, tearing up dozens of valuable livestock animals and devouring them swiftly. The army was called in, and managed to eventually subdue the "invasion" before it could get out of claw. Sixteen soldiers and thirty badgers were killed in the process, leading some locals to call this engagement "The Badger War". Despite the regrettable losses, our troops performed commendably against the savage beasts, which has comforted the people somewhat. The question still remains, however, what on earth could have flung so many Dire Badgers into the sky and carried them here? It would take some sort of very powerful storm to do such a thing, and in any case, Dire Badgers are rarely seen this far south. They are more common in the savage woods of the northern ponies. Could they be behind this?"

FIR.49.d:0 "It is really quite refreshing, being in contact with the mortal world again. After ten milennia in isolation, I had forgotten what it was like to wear a body of flesh. The shivering, the heat, the...feelings. All of these are foreign to me. But, being of a higher order than they, I can see things that they cannot. I can see their spirits, quailing within their frail shells, burning like bright lights. They are so clear to me...I could easily influence them, send lesser spirits into them, to change their attitudes."

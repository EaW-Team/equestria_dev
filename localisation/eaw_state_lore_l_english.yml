state_lore_text_container_state_name_short_75:0 "Manehattan"
state_lore_text_container_state_name_75:0 "The §YCity that Never Sleeps§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_75:0 "Throughout its illustrious history, §CManehattan§! has been given many titles: the City of Dreams; the Big Apple; Caput Mundi — the Capital of the World. Situated where the Hayston River meets the Celestial Sea, the §YThree Boroughs§! — Manehattan and its satellites, §YHayston§! and §YBronclyn§! — make up this sprawling megalopolis on the §CEast Coast§! of Equestria.\n\nBeing Equestria's largest and most populous city, Manehattan is also the most diverse. As the premier seaport of the continent, centuries of continuous foreign immigration has meant that, alongside the ponies of the Three Tribes, there exist substantial communities of thestrals, hippogriffs, zebras, kirin, and griffons within the metropolis. Canterlot may be the seat of the Diarchy, but it is the melting-pot of Manehattanite society that truly embodies the Equestrian spirit — that of harmonious coexistence, strength in diversity, and friendship free of prejudice.\n\nThe glamour of Manehattan's nightlife and entertainment industry, and its unassailable status as an international locus of arts and culture, all belie the true roots of the city's wealth — its §Ymassive industrial base§!, located on the outskirts of the suburbs. If one should gaze to the west from the crown of the Mare Statue, over and beyond the elegant arches of the Bronclyn Bridge, they would glimpse the smokestacks and cranes that juxtapose a parallel skyline — one that is gritty and grimy, yet no less grand — against the opalescence of the skyscrapers downtown.\n\nThe §CCelestial Sea Fleet§! — the backbone of the §YEquestrian Royal Navy§! — has its moorings in the deep waters and sheltered bays of Manehattan Harbour. Where prodigious amounts of capital flow through the wharfs and dockyards of Bronclyn, from Griffonia, Zebrica, and §Ybeyond§!, the iron hoof of maritime law ensures that the waters around the metropolis are kept safe, from threats both monstrous and mundane.\n\nLike all big cities, Manehattan has its fair share of problems. Only a few blocks away from the glitzy shopping avenues of Bridleway are run-down waterfront neighbourhoods teeming with the city's immigrant proletariat, and in the shadow of Manehattan's skyscrapers lie the inner-city slums and ghettoes — the proverbial undergrowth of the concrete jungle. Should the centuries-long peace in Equestria collapse, there is no doubt that strife and scarcity will come to Manehattan; in the face of rationing, curfews, and blackouts, it is all too easy to forget about solidarity and friendship.\n\nNow, in the new millennium, the city is threatened from without and within. Across the sea, §RGriffonia§! is poised for a decade of brutal conflict, whilst Manehattan's own §CLunarists§! grow more belligerent by the day, as the horrors of mechanized warfare encroach on ponies' nightmares. In the years to come, what fate will befall this great city?\n[eaw_state_lore_75_addendum]"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_75_addendum:0 "\n—————————————————————————————————————\n\nFollowing the defeat of the Principality of Equestria in the §RGreat War§!, the East Coast fell under the control of the victorious Changeling Hegemony. In the year §Y[?MAN.MAN_WS_GetFormDate]§!, §GQueen Chrysalis§! would subsequently devolve the governance of the East Coast to a military Protectorate centered around Manehattan.\n\nUpon the arrival of the §CProtectress Lilac§! in the city, the §GChangeling Administration§! commandeered the Crystaller Building — the tallest skyscraper in all of Equestria — as the headquarters for the new regime, whilst the Garrison's Schutzbataillons occupied the barracks and military bases vacated by the disbanded Equestrian army.\n"

state_lore_text_container_state_description_3:0 "§YCanterlot§!, the capital of the shining realm of §CEquestria§! and the definitive nexus of the country. Walking down the storied streets and avenues that make up the pristine city, you can spot the small tell-tale signs of the §R1002 Canterlot Invasion§!. And yet, looking at the vibrant life in the city; the cafés, the restaurants, the theaters, the parties, the soirees, you wouldn't be able to tell. Canterlot, as with the rest of Equestria, has moved on, content in their idea that the changelings were a bad event but one that will never repeat itself. Least of all anyone expects is for §RQueen Chrysalis§! to come back. But whatever the history, Canterlot is, and has been in step with the rest of the country. As Equestria grew under those first years under Luna and Celestia, so did Canterlot. When Equestria industrialized and grew past the years of medieval castles and nobles, Canterlot did too, when Luna was welcomed into the fold, it happened in Canterlot. Be it during the battle against Nightmare Moon, the battle against the Changelings, or indeed, as it has been for most of its history, the vibrant capital of Equestria, the home of ponies and Harmony, watched over by Princess Celestia's gaze, Canterlot has always been a snapshot of Equestria and its condition.\n\nBut indeed, if you took up the railroad to Canterlot, arriving at the palace, you will find the curriculum at the School for Gifted Unicorns the same as it has always been, and at galas at the Canterlot Palace they stick to routines from decades ago. While it may serve Equestria well now, they are outdated for the era, and are overdue for an overhaul. However, if a storm should hit, it would be a woeful one indeed.\n\nTime will tell what will happen to Canterlot as a new era dawns on the world. An era of opportunity, and an era of risk."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_12:0 "One of the largest cities on the Equestrian east coast only rivaled by §YManehattan§!, Fillydelphia has long been regarded as a center of industry and learning, and one of the cradles of the §YIndustrial Revolution§! in Equestria. It was once known as the workshop of the world, producing goods for export across the planet, and is famed for its medical school located beneath the pegasus district of Bells Air (commonly known as "Little Cloudsdale"). Other notable features of the city are its all-unicorn police force and §RDragon Town§!, a district inhabited exclusively by dragons, as well as the yearly Grapefruit Festival. In recent times the city was struggling with a severe §Cparasprite§! infestation, which took years to clear out.\n\nThe city has a long and rich history, being founded before Luna's Banishment over a thousand years ago, when the Princesses were still young. Indeed, the nickname of the city refers to the mutual love the sisters had for each other, which unfortunately meant that after the Banishment Celestia did everything she could to avoid the city. Despite Canterlot's neglect, Fillydelphia thrived nevertheless. After Luna's return and reformation a grand celebration was held in the city in honour of the Princesses' reconciliation, and the ponies of the city happily welcomed Celestia who could once more visit them without issue."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_70:0 "Located near the border with the §CCrystal Empire§! lie two settlements, on the opposite sides of the river: the suburban town of Riverpool and the thriving city of §YWhinnyapolis§!. Both of them have benefited greatly from the recent return of Crystal Empire from limbo, growing even more as centers of commerce and industry. Many crystal ponies inhabit the city and imports from the north are always on sale.\n\nWhinnyapolis surpassed its smaller twin Riverpool during the Industrial Revolution. Flour mills and sawmills powered by the rapids between the towns formed the core of their economy. Nowadays the city is more reliant on commercial services such as banking and transportation, being known as §C"The Gate to Crystal Empire"§!."

state_lore_text_container_state_name_74:0 "The §YHidden City§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_74:0 "Bales is an ancient city, one of the oldest ones in Equestria. Containing countless libraries and book stores, it was known as the §Y"City of Wisdom"§!. However, several decades ago the bustling city §Yvanished into thin air§!, and no one knew why. It remained a mystery until relatively recently.\n\n§GPrincess Twilight Sparkle§! managed to find the hidden city and break the curse that had made it vanish. She learned that a wizard named §YComet Tail the Starry-Eyed§! had cast a spell to protect the many books of the city from harm, but because he did the ritual at the wrong time, it ended up hiding the city entirely from outsiders. She cast the spell at the right time, breaking the curse and revealing the city. The ponies living in it, who had become reclusive over the years, were overjoyed when visitors flooded Bales.\n\nAt the present Bales is a center of learning, trade and book printing, producing ever more tomes not only for its own libraries, but for all the libraries of Equestria. The yearly §YBook Festival§! held in autumn draws ponies from across the nation."

state_lore_text_container_state_name_short_2:0 "Ponyville"
state_lore_text_container_state_name_2:0 "The §YTown§! of §GFriendship§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_2:0 "Ponyville, located next to the §GEverfree Forest§! southwest of Canterlot, was for most of its history an unremarkable rural settlement. The first pony inhabitants of the area were part of the §YApple Family§!, who were granted the land as a gift by §YPrincess Celestia§! herself almost a century ago. The first apple orchards were planted, but while the trees grew, the ponies discovered magical §CZap Apples§! inside the Everfree Forest. The jam prepared from these apples became famous, attracting many migrants. Stinkin' Rich, the grandfather of the entrepreneur Filthy Rich, opened a market selling the jam, which soon grew into a burgeoining business. The Apple and Rich families still live in the town to this day and are honoured as its founders.\n\nIn the years since, many ponies have moved to Ponyville, making it a very diverse town. All three races are present and live together in harmony. It is for this reason why Princess Celestia sent her young pupil, §YTwilight Sparkle§!, to live in the town and make some friends. She and the ponies she met soon became close friends and the wielders of the §YElements of Harmony§!, who have saved Equestria from countless threats. After her ascension to Alicornhood and her defeat of §RLord Tirek§!, Twilight Sparkle now lives in the §CCastle of Friendship§! north of the town. Next to it, she has opened the §YSchool of Friendship§! which has students from all across the world. Despite its small size, Ponyville is known across Equestria as the haven of friendship and harmony."

state_lore_text_container_state_name_68:0 "The §YTown§! in the §YSky§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_68:0 "There are several towns in Equestria which can only be inhabited by pegasi. Such towns are made out of clouds, which only pegasi can walk on, and float in the sky. §CCloudsdale§! is the oldest such town, and is regarded as the home of the Pegasus race.\n\nIt is famed for its architecture, its tall pillars and high halls made entirely from vapor and held together by magic. It also has the largest §CWeather Factory§! in Equestria, for pegasi are responsible for weather management. The clouds, rainbows and snowflakes made in the town are distributed all across the nation. Another notable feature is the §YCloudeseum§!, where the annual Best Young Flyer competition is held. The town is also known to be the birthplace of §CRainbow Dash§! and §YFluttershy§!, wielders of the Elements of Loyalty and Kindness respectively."

state_lore_text_container_state_name_short_13:0 "Baltimare"
state_lore_text_container_state_name_13:0 "The §YCharm City§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_13:0 "Baltimare is the largest settlement in the Equestrian South-East, located in the Horseshoe Bay. Originally a small fishing settlement, it industrialized and grew rapidly, mostly thanks to its natural harbour. It became a center of shipping and manufacturing with thriving docks.\n\nHowever, the workers have been treated worse than in many other Equestrian cities, especially during the reign of the last Mayor. Because of this Baltimare became the center of the Equestrian labour movement, housing the headquarters of the CAN-TER anarcho-syndicalist federation of trade unions and anarchists. A large protest had been held in the city during the Winter Revolution in Stalliongrad, and the Mayor of the city had been sacked by Celestia herself.\n\nDue to being located in the South-East, the city also houses a considerable minority of thestrals, whose conditions are even worse than that of the workers, but who are not allowed to join unions. Many Coltjuns from Hayseed Swamps inhabit the city as well, speaking their strange creole of Equestrian and Aquileian."

state_lore_text_container_state_name_short_38:0 "Rockville"
state_lore_text_container_state_name_38:0 "The §YMining City§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_38:0 "Surrounded by countless §Yrock farms§! and nestled among hills, Rockville is a center of mining industry and mineral processing. Its name derives from tonnes of rock regularly brought into the city from the rock farms for refinement. It was an insignificant village before the §Ygemstone rush§! of 931 ALB which attracted countless migrants.\n\nRockville is a city of foundries, steel mills and mines. The landscape around the city is barren and the air in the settlement itself is difficult to breathe. Yet it is also a prospering town, producing a large amount of gold, coal, sulfur, tin, copper, platinum, gemstones and more.\n\nIts inhabitants are grim-faced, their faces often covered in soot, but hard-working and relentless. Some call it the least friendly place in Equestria, but those outsides who have earned the trust of a Rockville pony know that they are the most trusty and reliable companies one may have."

state_lore_text_container_state_name_short_66:0 "Las Pegasus"
state_lore_text_container_state_name_66:0 "§YEquestria's Playground§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_66:0 "Among the sparser areas of Southwest Equestria, Las Pegasus stands out as the largest city in the Southwest and is known as the gambling capital and entertainment capital of the continent. It's filled with luxurious hotels, casinos, arcades, amusement parks and restaurants that brought the city much fame. Despite it being a floating cloud-city, even earth ponies and unicorns can walk on it thanks to more modern magical engineering, with long platforms of metal and concrete functioning as walkable streets. The service-orientated economy is thriving, and though there is a lack of farmland to sustain the city, food has always been imported from elsewhere in Equestria. There's something for everyone here, from newborns and young partiers to elders looking for something new and exciting.\n\nUnder this shining cloud-city however is the second half of Las Pegasus. Here, large companies such as Horseco and Rockville Oil dominate, their factories cluttering the cityscape. Gigantic steel foundries churn out endless tonnes of stainless steel, which is used by the huge shipyards in the construction of new luxury cruise ships and military vessels. Surrounding this industrial heart are the apartments of the common workers, who toil in service of large companies. It is fertile ground for leftist movements, some more radical than others, and the ponies of the cloud-city above demand the police to ensure that Stalliongradian influence does not spread. So far, they have only been moderately successful, but as long as Equestria remains stable the proletariat are unlikely to cause trouble."

state_lore_text_container_state_name_short_14:0 "Vanhoover"
state_lore_text_container_state_name_14:0 "The §YSaltwater City§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_14:0 "Located in Luna Bay, Vanhoover contains an excellent natural harbour, and has thus long been a vital port-city. Founded on the ruins of an earlier settlement which had been destroyed by §COlenian Vikings§!, it grew into an important trade port even before industrialisation, being located near the mouth of an important river as well.\n\nAfter the Industrial Revolution, the city grew even more, becoming a vital base of the §YEquestrian Navy§! and a center of shipbuilding. It is the terminus of the transcontinental Equestrian railway and its port is among the largest in the country. Its primary trade good is lumber, imported from Vaverfront across the Luna Bay, but in recent years the service sector has continued to grow. Many movies are filmed here, earning it the nickname "Applewood North", and numerous tourists come there from the south to enjoy the cold weather.\n\nA large portion of the populace consists of Olenian deer, who work on the docks or sell their wares at the markets. There are even some changelings living in the city, though they are viewed with suspicion by the rest of the inhabitants. In recent years the countless dock workers and sailors of the city have unionized and now agitate for better rights. There are rumours that they receive support from the Supreme Soviet of Stalliongrad, but it is not known if this is true."

state_lore_text_container_state_name_59:0 "The §GGreen City§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_59:0 "On the southern bank of the Tall river lies the city of Tall Tale. Despite its size, one might easily think it's a small rural town, thanks to its rustic buildings, many parks and numerous trees. Yet it is in the end an industrial city, as evidenced by the high grain silos and the car traffic on the streets.\n\nTall Tale grew from a humble farming village to a proper city after the Industrial Revolution. Yet it never forgot its roots, being surrounded by farmland and having food processing and transportation as its economic foundations. An important railway leading to §YVanhoover§! passes through the city, and is used to transport countless bags of grain and other farm produce for export. The city is especially famous for its bread, said to be the best in Equestria.\n\nNotable sights include the centuries-old Tall Bridge, the Farmers' Market in the central square of the city, and the Museum of Agriculture. The yearly §YHarvest Festival§! attracts tens of thousands of visitors each year thanks to its generous offering of delicious baked goods."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_21:0 "Appleloosa is a young town, having been built within a year in 999 ALB. Established by Equestrian settlers, it is surrounded by apple orchards which are used to produce the town's primary export, famed apple pies. Unsurprisingly, many inhabitants of the town are part of the vast Apple family. It is governed by §YSheriff Silverstar§! who maintains law and order. The town has a saloon known as the Salt Block, a clock tower and a stage for musical performances. It is known for its horse-drawn horse-drawn carriages and local mild west dances.\n\nIn 1001 ALB, Appleloosa was at the epicenter of the short but violent conflict known as the §RApple War§!. It erupted after nearby buffalo tribes demanded the ponies to tear down their orchards, for they had been planted on their traditional stampeding grounds. The ponies refused to destroy their livelihoods and the buffalo attacked. Compromise was only reached when Chief Thunderhooves was downed by an apple pie, which he found to be delicious. Soon a historic agreement was signed: The ponies get to keep their orchards, as long as they gift apple pies to the buffalo. Ever since, peace has prevailed between the two races, but time will tell if it lasts."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_16:0 "Deep in the steamy jungles of the Tenochtitlan basin lies the largely ruined city which gives the region its name. In fact, when explorers from northern Equestria first discovered it, they called it a "Lost City" even though it has been continuously inhabited for over a millennium. To this day, the ponies of the Neighua tribe live in the city like their ancestors did.\n\nSurrounding Tenochtitlan is a vast network of canals, gaining their water from the river which flows past the city. On these canals, as well as the river itself, one may find the famed §GFloating Gardens§! -- or what remains of them, at least. The natives still use them to grow plants such as maize, beans and flowers, though many of them are overgrown.\n\nIn the center of the city itself stands the imposing §YPyramid of the Sun§!, the primary religious site of the Neighua. Although it has seen far less use under Celestia's rule (and no sacrifices whatsoever), locals still use it to affirm their loyalty to the Princess. In return, she provides modern medicine, fertilizer, machine tools and more, albeit the natives are left alone to live their peaceful lives in the traditional manner, in huts of stone, mud and wood."

state_lore_text_container_state_name_short_30:0 "Ayacachtli"
state_lore_text_container_state_name_30:0 "The §YCity§! of the §YMoon§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_30:0 "There is a charm in the city of Ayacachtli that begets wonderous thoughts in anypony; here is a city, that was ancient before Equestria had even been formed. Located in the southern jungles, in the mountains on the border of Badlands, Ayacachtli has the dubious honour of being the oldest thestral city in the world. Legends hold it, that it was constructed by a thestral Moonspeaker with the aid of an Ursa Major. Historians, however, place its origins to many millenia ago, to the times when thestral tribes and the Neighua came into conflict and a need for a safe haven was born. Whatever it may have been, thestrals have been living in the city for so long, that only bare estimates can be given with current historical records.\n\nQuite an unusual aspect about Ayacachtli is the fact it is located inside the mountain range, inside a cast cavern dug over time by its denizens. Even as times have advanced, majority of the city is still located safely there, with just part of the more modern city located outside. Where, along with them, plenty of terraces for farming are located to feed the mountain city. But it is not food that Ayacachtli is known for; for the mountains contain many riches such as copper, silver and gold. Historians have traced many ancient trade routes leading to Ayacachtli from the north, carrying goods such as iron weapons and armour in exchange for the mined minerals. Evidence shows that Ayacachtli served as a vital link for trade between the jungles and north, through which luxury goods such as sugar and cocoa from jungle tribes passed by. Once the princesses proceeded with their formation of Equestria, Ayacachtli found itself in a favourable position - at least until the incident with Nightmare Moon occured. Now shunned, the thesrals returned to living amongs themselves, in fear of respitals and revenge for siding with the horrid monster that had once been their beloved princess. This especially hurt Ayacachtli and the city endured for centuries as but a hollow shell of a once mighty realm.\n\nToday, Ayacachtli stands as a testament for vigority of thestralkind as a near total majority of its denizens are made up of thestrals. Even the ponies there are usually tribals from the jungles, who have interacted with the thestrals far longer than any northener has and even tend to share a common tongue with. Modernization is present in the city but mixed in to tradition and the peculiar aspects of thestrals; Ayacachtli has no real streets, as near-every denizen can fly. This has led to the city developing not horitzontally as a traditional city but primarily vertically. Tall towers, reaching from the cavern's ceiling to the floor, dot the vast cave, with the odd bridge crossing the gaps between them. Even with modern electricity, most of Ayacachtli is cast in but dim light, to better suit the sensitive eyes of thestrals. Further caverns extend out from the main one, which lead to the many mining tunnels; Ayacachtli even to this day is mostly dependant upon its ore exports to many Equestrian industries north; one could perhaps find some irony in how some things never change.\n\nCentral part of the city and an aspect that cannot be missed is the Temple of Moon, located at the city's center and remains a staunchly visited complex by the thestrals. It is the place where every Moonspeaker comes to learn the traditional ways and read the ancient texts stored within there. Some said to more than millenia old but no outsiders are permitted to see them, not even a certain Princess of Books. But what a visitor can see is already extraordinary, and a sight to rival even that of Canterlot. For right past its entrance, visitors are met with a giant dome covering the main hall. On this dome there is a vividly well-detailed star map, one born from countless generations of work from the Moonspeakers. Every possible inch of the carved stone accurately details the wonders of the night sky to the point that astronomers from Princess Luna's Academy of Stars have praised the meticulous work the priests have done, even rivalling achievements historical astronomers such as Galloping Galley and Leap Ordinance. There have been calls to preserve the temple complex for sake of history but for thestrals, however, the temple still serves its original purpose, as it did since its inception; to venerate the Moon, as their forebears did before them. A work that continues on, and will do so for more millenia to come."

The other denizens of the forest are far less friendly than her.\n\nUnlike in rest of Equestria, weather and nature in the Everfree Forest are outside the influence and caretaking of ponykind. Clouds move on their own, gnarly and thorny plants grow without limits, and fearsome beasts stalk the shadows. Groves of Poison Joke and nests of adorable but ravenous Parasprites lure the unwary traveller to their doom.\n\nGetting lost in the Everfree Forest is the nightmare of any pony living near it. Those who dare to travel through it do it as quickly as they can and are prepared to fight for their lives.

It is a huge structure of stone and has almost completely broken down over the centuries. Once, Celestia and Luna lived there together, having established it as their capital. But those days of splendour ended when Luna was consumed by jealousy and became §RNightmare Moon§! who tried to slay her beloved sister. Much of the castle was destroyed and Luna was banished to the Moon, but Celestia was overcome with sorrow. She and the entire court abandoned the castle, leaving behind nothing but painful memories.\n\nThe location is avoided almost entirely by ponies, for it is rumoured to be haunted by the dreaded §gPony of Shadows§!. Those few who have dared to enter the ruins have quickly become lost in the labyrinthine hallways of stone, watched by statues of stone dragons eroded by centuries of rain. They will also quickly discover the numerous hidden passages and traps that Princess Luna had commissioned for her amusement, and possibly stumble upon the personal library of Princess Celestia, or what remains of it.\n\nThe §YElements of Harmony§! were hidden in the castle before Nightmare Moon's return, after which they were retrieved by the Wielders of the Elements. In a ravine near the castle is a cave with the §CTree of Harmony§!, planted by the ancient §YPillars of Old Equestria§! a thousand years ago. It is a magical tree which controls and contains the Everfree Forest, and held the Elements before they were used by the Princesses to defeat Discord.

It had been a relatively small town before the Industrial Revolution, when the abundant natural resources of the region allowed it to grow massively. Within centuries, it was one of the largest cities in Equestria, a thriving center of industry always covered in thick smog, especially during cold winters.\n\nYet the growth of the city had a dark side. Its workers were mistreated and discontent grew. Due to its distance from the capital, Princess Celestia remained unaware of the tension before it was too late. The workers revolted, inspired by the writings of Caramel Marks and led by §RSteel Stallion§!, and seceded from Equestria in the Winter Revolution.\n\nAfter Steel Stallion died from illness, the Supreme Soviet renamed Princessyn in his memory to §RStalliongrad§!, which remains the city's name to this day. Nowadays Stalliongrad is a proletarian city, with any remains of capitalism erased. Gone are the houses of the merchants, the markets and the shops, the colourful adverts and the luxurious cars. It is now exclusively the city of smokestacks, factories, apartment blocks, machines, cogs, smoke and steel. In the center stands the imposing Palace of the Soviets, a grand project that has been years in the making, a testament to the industriousness and ambition of the Stalliongradian proletariat."

For some unknown reason, the lake exhibits magical properties, making it a valued object for study and a source of clear drinking water.\n\nThe city itself straddles the coast of the lake and is way longer than it is wide, with most changelings preferring to live as close to the waterfront as possible. Luckily, waterborne transportation makes it easy to move from one side of the city to the other and the lake is always filled with boats of all shapes and sizes. Because of the northern climate and the relative lack of industry, the air is clear and the city itself feels clean and tidy, a reprieve from some of the more industrialised hives.

Further downstream on the Griffking is the provincial city of §HGrieslein§!, which never grew to such proportions as Mirabelle, but has been the historical capital of the region.

Around it, straddled on the west bank of the Griffking, through small and winding streets, the city stretches out. In the centre, close to the manor, are the many offices and buildings required to run a modern state.

The series of buildings are built around a small court and house the representatives of the Feathisian people. Originally, the Volkshof was there to house the General Estates, representatives from merchants, nobles and the prelates. As Feathisia reformed into a democracy, however, the old buildings were renovated to become the symbol of the new power of the people. However, even this hof, or court, is not the reason why De Vleugels is called §Ythe Hofstad.§! At the time when the city grew in power and size, the Southern-Griffonian styles were in fashion, as the Empire had recently subdued that part of Griffonia. Thus, many houses or groups of houses were built around smaller or larger courts or inner gardens, while still retaining the Feathisian brick houses, making the city a unique blend of southern ideas with northern materials."

In addition, its distinct warrior traditions and its law codes made it a notable power in the region, one that could well have been a threat to the rising §YGriffonian Empire§!.\n\nAlas, the Katernii fell not on the battlefield, but due to treason. A local noble family swore allegiance to the new, rising power of the Herzland in secrecy. With their help, the Katernii army was subverted and outmanouvered, ensuring that the old kingdom died not with a bang, but a whimper. For their service, this family was given the lands of Katerin, taking the name §Yvon Katerinburg§! after the city.

While it may not be a political center as powerful as say Griffenheim, Canterlot or Rijekograd, it is one of most prosperous and industrious city on the continent. Many exquisite or modern goods come out of the city, be them diamonds, cars or fashionable Griffonian clothes and while Equestria still maintains the lead on modern manufacturing, Skyfall is home of the most technically advanced factories and craftgriffs in all of Griffonia. The currently most famous one is the Kessler automobile plant which produces some of the most widely used cars in Griffonia.\n\nSkyfall is known as a city but it is actually a metropolitan community of nineteen smaller towns, each ruled by a mayor and their own local councils. This is merely a near-folkloric archaism as these "towns" have no recognizable borders and some streets can belong to several towns. Even distinguishing them between on the basis of wealth, activities or style is impossible as Skyfall is so chaotically organized that one may leave a street of insalubrious houses only to find mansions just around the corner. Lack of uniformity and charming chaos are indeed the defining features of the city, making it a divisive place to visit. To some, it is an endless wonder to stroll in while an ignominious mess to the more orderly-minded.\n\nSkyfall is home to many landmarks, both old and new. At its historical center sits the Grote Markt, the historical market of the city which was home to the most prestigious guild halls of the city decorated with golden gables, balustrades and statues. Not far of the Grote Markt stands the Skyfall Stock Exchange built in the style of a trinitarian temple and which is the busiest stock exchange in the continent. North of the city, you can find the great Groverian Park, Skyfall's largest park area where the three great temples dedicated to Eyr, Arcturius and Boreas have been built. The great harbour is also known for some of its old market places and warehouses as well as hosting the former Imperial Navy which has been seized and nationalized during Guichard's secession. A hill on the southern part of the city is home to a gigantic palace of justice designed by Joseph Poulaert, a Fezeran-born architect who had sought to create a monument showcasing the might of the law and the Griffonian judiciary. Originally planned under Grover IV's reign, it was finished by Ghislain Guichard's government as a tribute to the Trade Federation dedication to the rule of law though not without the help of some corner-cutting.\n\nSkyfall's population is one of the most diverse on the continent if not the world. Virtually every sentient species is represented in some way despite Griffons forming a plurality of the population. Skyfallians are known to be educated, festive and gregarious if perhaps a bit unsophisticated and plagued with a bizarre accent. They are also known to both rageously enjoy criticizing their city and fiercely call out any foreigners who would dare try to do it themselves. The typical Skyfallian is fatter than the average and usually enjoys more than a little beer or strong liquors as well fried food. It is also known that Skyfallian are very prone to organize themselves in groups and the city is teeming with corporations, old guilds, more recent labour movements, cooperatives and organized crime. Like Fezera and Rottendedam, the city is indeed home to some of the "penose", these coastal mobs who smuggle and run various businesses."

They will be able to find the great Trinity Hill - finally free of squalor - on top of which lies the three great white temples dedicated to Eyr, Boreas and Arcturius. It is there that the kings of Aquileia have traditionally been crowned as shown by the royal banners and tapestries of the ruling king. The Promenade des Ducs is also a major attraction on the banks the great Belle river. This fancy avenue is home to many museums, libraries, theaters and private salons where the literate, wealthy or artistic elites meet and mingle. on the western edge of the cities lies the Vieux Fort, an old citadel whose black walls barely survived the sacking of the city by §RGrover II§!, and is now home to the university of the city. In the eastern part of the cities, they will find the Domaine Royal with its great parks and palaces home of the Discret dynasty and the royal government. For those with a taste for the stranger things, many parts of the city hosts a peculiar undercity called the Catacombs which acted for centuries as the city's boneyard. It is said that in the ancient times, it was a holy site dedicated to the banished god Maar.\n\nThe story of Aquila is a unique one for it is one of the few great Griffonian cities that did not owe anything to the old Arantigan empire. Instead, it was the bastion of freedom for many confederated tribes that would form the realm of Aquileia a century before our era. After becoming the capital of the kingdom, the city became a thriving trading and crafting center, one of the economic hearts of the kingdom. This long era of prosperity saw its decline in the eighth century when Aquileia was subjugated by the §YGriffonian Empire§! and finally ended in 785 when the kingdom and much of its capital was burned down by Grover II's armies. To add insult to injury, the princess Giselda Discret was forced to marry the angry emperor in the ruined temple of Arcturius on Trinity Hill. This saddest of weddings is still commemorated today and princess Giselda hailed as a martyr of the city. After this, the city slowly recovered but it is only after independence in 972 that the city finally saw a return to greatness. Much investment was made into the city by the Republicans between 980 and 985 and finally during the Discret restoration which saw the beginning of the great transformation of the city."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_531:0 "Southeast of the Kingdom of Griffonstone, a single peak in its mountain range pierces the sky. The mountain is known as the Solarspike and it is one of the most sacred places of griffonkind. Here, it is said, the gods created the griffons. The first griffons were given shape by Eyr, giving them their body; wings to reach towards the heavens and beaks to praise the divine. Arcturius gave the griffons their strength; the strength to overcome all evils they might encounter, the strength to build mighty structures and tools and to overcome personal hardships. Boreas gave them intelligence, an understanding of themselves and of truth and rationality. An understanding of law and government, so that the structure of below might reflect the structure of the heavens. Lastly, Maar gave the griffons souls. With a soul they could make their own decisions and feel and decide on what was right and wrong.\n\nHaving been granted these boons, the first griffons flew out from the Solarspike to found Griffonstone, before spreading all over the continent. Much of the early history of Griffonia is shrouded in myth, but records of places of worship around the Solarspike go back to the very earliest days of known history.\n\nTo this day, there exists a small place of worship at the foot of the mountain, where pilgrims can bring offerings. From there, to show your humility towards the gods, you can walk up the stairway leading up the mountain, foregoing the use of wings. Those wishing to climb to the summit will be met with disappointment, however, as the trail ends halfway to the top of the holy mountain. There, a small shrine marks the edge of the mundane world. It contains small stone figures of the Trinity, with a broken statuette laying down in shame outside the shrine. At the zenith of where a mortal is allowed to wander, in the quiet solace of the thin mountain air, the pilgrim can rest and contemplate on the journey. To go any higher would be to tread into the realm of the divine and blasphemy. All must eventually turn back and accept that for all their hard work, divinity is outside their reach."

Cultural differences become even more noticeable during bi-annual celebrations that are based entirely on local traditions, such as the Festival of Cheese and Wine, and the Parade of Feathers. Many locals also belong to an unusual religious sect known as Trinitarianism, which worships all three griffon deities as manifestations of a single divine form.

state_lore_text_container_state_description_637:0 "§YDogaz-dûm§!, also known as §YPsidom§! or more commonly §YDiamond Mountain§! is the great capital of the Diamond Dog race. It is said that §YKiri§!, the first pup of Geri and §Yfirst King of the Longtails§!, was led into the valley below the mountain by a falling star that came to settle in lake §YKhezeld-Zarim§!. As he looked into the lake, he saw the stars high above and so tempted by their glimmer he dove into the water and emerged with a crown of seven diamonds that shone with the light of seven stars. A large stone carved with golden runes stands at the alleged location of this event below the grand doors of Diamond Mountain.\n\nThe doors of Diamond Mountain stand tall in a §Ygrand fortified façade carved from the mountain§!, guarded by many statues of ancient hounds. Behind them many-pillared halls of stone, with high golden roofs and silver floors stretch for countless miles deep under the ground, lit by lamps of crystal that shine like stars and the sun. The vastness of this space is dwarfed only by the almighty mines that stretch out in unfathomable crevasse deep under the ground lined with bridges, ramps and mining tools. From these mines, gold and gemstones are gathered in vast quantities and carved and chiselled by ancient paws into treasures unlike any have seen. And these treasures sit in a vast hall under onyx and gold platforms in which a mighty carven throne stands, etched with crystals and runes of power, from which the §YKing of the Diamond Dogs rules§!. Forges of fire, hot enough to melt the stone itself, roar deep under the mountains in which weapons, armour and trinkets of all kinds are created by master-smiths working tirelessly day and night.\n\nDespite the grandeur, all this was §Rbuilt on the backbreaking work of slaves§!. And the treasure hall lies mostly empty after the city was §Rsacked by forces of Hellquill§!. All around broken slaves, shackled and collared, work almost unseen by the free hounds to keep the city in its unimaginably grand condition."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_619:0 "Take a stroll down the Domovinska Avenija and cross the Slobode Bridge over the Grifking River where it meets the Gold River and enter §YRijekograd§! proper. Down on the river, you can see barges and ships, all shipping goods around the §CRiverlands§!. Wine from Deponya and Lake City heading upriver to Wittenland. Enchanted goods and such in return heading downriver towards the western frontier of the Coalition. Look closely and you can even see Griffon traders hailing from the Empire at the docks to buy select goods to ship back home to §RGriffenheim§!, even when the alliance they are standing in was founded to resist them. And the ever-present customs houses dot the riverbanks on the Grifking, but also on the Gold River where cloud marble and vases are transferred to smaller boats that shoot across the rivers. The griffon traders on the docks have just handed over an unknown crate when you exit the bridge and enter the city itself on the Unija Cesta. Taking in the awe of the only real functioning representative democracy in the Riverlands, possibly the world and especially its capital with its wide avenues and boulevards, with lavish gardens showing the wealth that the city takes in. Look to the sky and you will see buildings that are almost themselves works of art. Take a turn left at the Central Railway Terminal and stare up the Avenija Republik towards the §YPalaca Rijeke§!. Formerly the royal residence, when Rijekograd was ruled by the Water Dynasty and its princesses it is today the beating heart of Rijekan democracy as the meeting place of the §YSabor§!.\n\nNow, when you enter the Palaca Rijeke as a visitor, you will see paintings and frescos of the old dynasty, of how they led the city to independence, how they expanded their realm, and how they eventually fell in Wittenland. Follow the paintings and frescos up and down the palace, through the public corridors and see the story of Rijekograd from its inception to the present day. Enter the Sabor itself, and you would, under most circumstances see representative democracy in action. Under most circumstances that is. As of 1007, it is the site of some of the most hilarious political debates in known memory, with the incumbent Chancellor, §CRiver Swirl§! and her political nemesis, §CNova Whirl§!, frequently trading insults in the chamber. But anyways. Exit the Palaca Rijeke and follow the promenade along the Green River to the §YSoft Water Theatre§!. The site of some of the funniest comedies in the Riverlands, it is also, coincidentally the site of a local legend of an old actor haunting the place after dying in an accident involving a sandbag, three rat tails and a roasted turkey. He haunts the place hunting for the person who killed him, moving around random seats and chandeliers in the audience. Of course, one of the theatre companies that inhabits the theatre is known to be notorious tricksters, much to the irritation of the resident orchestra and scenographers in the theatre. Can't win them all and all that. See their production, 'The Battle of Coltstream' and laugh your way through the satires of the Water Dynasty and their portrayal of them while munching on the provided snacks.\n\nWhen you're done there, if there's still time in the day and you arrived at the right time, you should have time to grab a hoofball game after grabbing the streetcar to the stadium. While the River Games are unfortunately as of time of writing still a concept on paper, the local leagues are still good enough for most purposes. Be sure to avoid the hooligans though. They do not look kindly on ponies from outside their little city. But on the contrary, the stadium sells some great hayfries and hayburgers, and you should under all circumstances if you are there.\n\nWith the tense political atmosphere descending on Rijekograd, the next few years in this city will be very interesting indeed.

state_lore_text_container_state_description_617:0 "Near the humble source of the grand Grifking River stands the ancient capital of Wittenland and arguably the oldest pony city in the Riverlands: Wittenburgh. The city's early history is shrouded in myth, but it is said that the first §YHigh King of Wittenland§! built his palace there, and the settlement grew around it. Nothing remains of this legendary building, but at least the §CGreat Library§! founded by his successors still stands.\n\nAfter the decline and stagnation of Wittenland, the city has fallen behind as well. The northern cities of Jezeragrad, Bakara, Rijekograd and others now surpass it in size and prosperity. In the beginning of the millennium, the city still lacked proper lighting and sewage, while in the north the first telegraph wires already connected the cities. However, the reforms of §YQueen White Star§! have done much to drag the city to modernity, albeit at the cost of many old buildings that were simply too dilapidated to be renovated. Such is the price of progress, and most inhabitants of the city have accepted it, except for some of the more conservative mage-nobles.\n\nAside from the Great Library, which has one of the largest collections of books in the entire world, there is the Royal Palace, an elaborate stone castle decorated with shining crystals, the Hippodrome, a large stadium where the annual Derby is held, the Old Bridge across the Grifking river that leads to the small Pònaidh town of Ceann Tòrr, the Merchants' District on the banks of the river near the bridge where one may find many fine wares from all across the Riverlands, and lastly the luxurious manors of the mage-nobles. On the outskirts of the city are the slums inhabited by non-unicorns, who have traditionally been the lowest of the low in Wittenland society. Slowly but surely however, the huts are torn down and replaced with proper modern housing, affordable for all."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_645:0 "Where the river Agon meets the sea and the slopes of the mountainous lands of East Griffonia roll into gentle valleys, lays the city of §GNimbusi§!, capital of Nimbusia. When the ponies first came to the Riverlands, legend had it that only the pegasi were able to tame the mountainous lands of its far east. Many proud cities were founded in the valleys between the mountains, inland and along the coast, but none would reach the fame of Nimbusi. The city, like many in Nimbusia, is built around the highest point, §Ythe Akropolis.§! Serving as a refuge during siege and troubled times, it has gotten somewhat of a sacred status amongst the residents, who erected temples to their pantheon on this hill. However, the temple complex is starting to wear from age, and major renovations will be necessary to preserve the Akropolis.\n\nMany of Nimbusi's highest class residences, the citizens, do not live in splendour, but in minimalist houses, with furniture built for practical purposes, not aesthetics. Thus, Nimbusi's most impressive structures are all public works and wealthy citizens often donate to construction of these buildings to show their opulence. Libraries, statues, theatres and temples, but also sewers, offices and industry are all designed by perioikoi, non-citizens, and the helot underclass. In Nimbusia, architecture is not a citizen's job, after all.\n\nThese divides in Nimbusian society, between pegasus and non-pegasus, determine the very soul of the city, with the upper class spending their time honing their martial skills or working on philosophy or art, while domestic servants take care of the household and periokoi do the jobs citizens don't find joy in pursuing. Go to the Agora in Nimbusi, and you will find no pegasi on a market day, just periokoi selling their wares to helots. But go on a non-market day and you may find citizens resting between the pillars, debating politics and philosophy or making music together. Don't be fooled, all of them are trained killers!"

Second only to §YBugsmere§! in age, Blosmport, also known locally as §CCaladhbláth§!, is a sprawling port city that easily dwarves all other hive settlements on the island. Being the largest and most populated, §YBlosmport§! is Greneclyf's cultural, administrative, and technological capital.\n\nIt is also the traditional home of the §GLeamhan Clan§! and the fabled meeting spot between the ponies of §CFarbrook§! and the Grenclyfian changelings. Perhaps because of this history, there are many communities of foreigners, with the largest being an old community of ponies. This goes against the commonly-held belief that changelings only seek other creatures to exploit them. Greneclyf is more than ready to receive §Ycontinentals§!. This is a poorly-kept secret on the island but barely talked about on the continent.\n\nMuch of Blosmport still has a hoof in the past, with much of the denser districts being underground or aboveground hive structures more in line with the traditional changeling settlements. This means that much of the area aboveground is relatively unoccupied and open for expansion: a good prospect for anycreature seeking a new home!"

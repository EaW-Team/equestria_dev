KAT_the_mad_princess:0 "The Mad Princess' Reign"
KAT_the_mad_princess_desc:0 "The title held by Diellza von Katerinburg within her Principality and beyond is "The Insane". Even the most diehard monarchist are forced to concede that the princess in Katerinburg embodies the trappings of hereditary rule. There is no escape from a mad ruler. Her insanity has driven many civil servants and advisors away from her court and makes finding people to work with her government a difficult task. Her antics have ruined whatever remained of Katerin's reputation amongst the Herzlanders. She has attained the dubious achievement of making Katerin known worldwide as a buffoon state. At best."

KAT_the_Deadlands:0 "The Desolation"
KAT_the_Deadlands_desc:0 "Katerin has long been known as a deadweight to the Empire. Even before the reign of Diellza, Katerin was among the poorest regions in the Empire, covered by the dark Scheißwald forest and vast marshland. Things have only gotten worse during Diellza's mad rule. The once booming trade city of Katerinburg was forcibly relocated from the Griffking deeper into the marshes, the nobles abused Diellza's state of mind to gain more privileges at the expense of the peasants and mismanagement became rampant. Sanitation, healthcare and education are all crumbling, like all of Katerin is."

KAT_glitterhoof:0 "Glitterhoof"
KAT_glitterhoof_desc:0 "Glitterhoof is a unicorn skull gifted by Wingfried to his cousin Diellza several years ago. Since then, she has developed an interesting relationship with this inanimate object. Glitterhoof is Diellza's lover and rival, husband and enemy, depending on the day and Diellza's mood. Sometimes she wants to marry it, sometimes shatter it. This also means Diellza is completely uninterested in any suitors and nobles fear what would happen if their new Prince would be a lifeless pony skull."

### National Focuses ###

KAT_do_own_work:0 "Власть Диелзы"
KAT_do_own_work_desc:0 "Теперь, когда основные вопросы решены, настало время укрепить авторитет Диелзы в княжестве. Сама Принцесса слабо интересуется подобными вещами, и потому она решила передать большую часть дел в Katerintreue. Время покажет, наскольку мудрым было это решение."
KAT_assign_yesmen:0 "Расширить Katerintreue"
KAT_assign_yesmen_desc:0 "Katerintreue в настоящий момент слишком мал, чтобы эффективно управлять целым герцогством, и потому должен быть расширен. У нас нет недостатка в амбициозных грифонах, жаждущих попасть в Katerintreue, а в обмен на выгодное назначение можно получить довольно много выгодных одолжений."
KAT_infiltrate_the_orders:0 "Проникнуть в Ордена"
KAT_infiltrate_the_orders_desc:0 "Рыцарские ордена Катерины не очень хорошо относятся к правлению принцессы и Katerintreue. Многие в новом правительстве опасаются, что они могут устроить заговор и сместить их. Чтобы убедиться, что подобная попытка будет раскрыта до ее осуществления, несколько агентов Katerintreue начали проникать в ордена, в надежде подорвать их мощь любыми доступными средствами."
KAT_peasant_yesmen:0 "Простогрифоны в Katerintreue"
KAT_peasant_yesmen_desc:0 "Хотя Katerintreue начинался как совет благородных, помогающий принцессе в повседневном управлении государством, растущее влияние организации сделало членство в ней ценным подарком для любого жителя Катерины. Позволив некоторым из наиболее влиятельных простолюдинов войти в совет, мы сможем получить несколько ценных одолжений, а так же гарантированно успокоим народ."
KAT_pocketed_yeogriffs:0 "Йеогрифоны из Katerintreue"
KAT_pocketed_yeogriffs_desc:0 "В то время, как проникновение в рыцарские ордена проходит согласно плану, некоторые из наших агентов обнаружили, что стали кандидатами на должность Йеогрифа. Получив ее, они определенно окажутся в лучшем положении, чтобы докладывать об активности ордена. Нет нужды говорить, что поддержка этих агентов должна быть в приоритете на ближайшие несколько недель."
KAT_armed_taxmen:0 "Вооружить Сборщиков Налогов"
KAT_armed_taxmen_desc:0 "Грифоны Катерины, откровенно говоря, нищие. Собрать с них налоги так же сложно, как заставить камень кровоточить. Решить эту проблемы очень просто - достаточно разбить камень молотком.  С этого момента, королевские сборщики налогов в Катерине будут носить с собой оружие, куда бы они не пошли, дабы "стимулировать" население выплачивать налоги в полном объеме."
KAT_legalize_banditry:0 "Легализовать Бандитизм"
KAT_legalize_banditry_desc:0 "В Катерине едва хватает призывников для защиты основных городов и поселков, очистка сельской местности от бандитов невыполнимой задачей для наших скудных сил. Но недавно, Принцесса представила на суд Katerintreue… нестандартное решение проблемы бандитов: что если разбой будет легальным?"
KAT_enforcers_of_her_will:0 "Боевики Katerintreue"
KAT_enforcers_of_her_will_desc:0 "Теперь, когда бандиты лояльны Катерине, задача по обеспечению контроля за сельской местностью стала выполнима. Проблема заключается лишь в крепостных, живущих там. Они крайне неохотно хотят служить правительству, которое им практически не помогает. Такое неподчинение нельзя стерпеть, и бойцы Katerintreue разъяснят им, что выбора у них нет."
KAT_define_territory:0 "Обозначить Территорию"
KAT_define_territory_desc:0 "Новосозданные боевые подразделения показали свой энтузиазм в выполнении свой работы, возможно даже несколько чрезмерный. В то время, как они прекрасно справляются с наведением порядка среди крепостных, когда они встречаются друг с другом, результаты бывают очень плачевны. Боевики имеют тенденцию конфликтовать друг с другом за владение налоговыми поступлениями, и если мы не определим для каждого из них определенную территорию, дела пойдут еще хуже."
KAT_enforce_corvee:0 "Напомнить Гражданам о их Долге"
KAT_enforce_corvee_desc:0 "Теперь, когда боевики Katerintreue патрулируют сельскую местность, напоминая крестьянам о цене непослушания, настало время заставить их работать. Катерина в руинах и ее реконструкция достаточно сложная задача. Если мы хотим когда-нибудь превратить эти земли из пустошей в выгодные владения, нам надо заставить крепостных работать до изнеможения."
KAT_kat_march_railroad:0 "Катеринбёргская Железная Дорога"
KAT_kat_march_railroad_desc:0 "Катеринбёрг, будучи столицой государства, сильно далек от понятия современного города. Город поглощен бедностью и криминалом, полноценная железная дорога, соединяющая его с остальной страной никогда не была построена, из за опасности окружающих болот. Такое состояние дел больше не может продолжаться, поэтому Katerintreue приказал построить дорогу, вне зависимости от того, сколько крестьянских жизней это будет стоить."
KAT_link_einfoort:0 "Соединить Лингермилл"
KAT_link_einfoort_desc:0 "Поскольку столица теперь имеет функционирующие железнодорожные пути, перспектива соединить ее с Лингермиллом теперь реальна. Прямой путь между Катеринбёргом и Андокшдадтом позволит сэкономить многие недели пути через опасную сельскую местность. Некоторые могут посчитать условия работы на постройке этой железной дороги опасными, но Диелзу это точно не беспокоит."
KAT_furstentumwerke_katalina:0 "Княжеский концерн Диелзы"
KAT_furstentumwerke_katalina_desc:0 "Катерина, честно говоря, индустриально отсталая страна. Полный хаос последних нескольких лет отпугнул любые иностранные инвестиции, а любой грифон, у которого есть достаточно денег, что-бы открыть фабрику, скорее предпочтет потратить их на бегство из Катерины, чем на инвестиции в ней. Но теперь, когда мы подняли налоговые поступления, появилась возможность прямого правительственного финансирования для нескольких фабрик."
KAT_mines_of_andorstadt:0 "Шахты Андорштадта"
KAT_mines_of_andorstadt_desc:0 "Андорштадт - крупнейший город Лингермилла, рядом с которым некогда были очень прибыльние шахты, поддерживавшие экономику города. К сожалению, хаос, поглотивший государство, в сочетании с нехваткой рабочей силы, заставил шахты закрыться. Но теперь, когда Katerintreue установило порядок, был создан план по использованию некоторых заключенных и крестьян для восстановления работы шахт под управлением Katerintreue."
KAT_trades_education:0 "Торговое Образование"
KAT_trades_education_desc:0 "Katerintreue наконец получил достаточно полномочий от принцессы, что бы создать полноценную, хоть и неполную, систему образования. В отличие от учрежденной Диелзой системы, силой направлявших случайных грифонов читать книги в библиотеках, новая система образования базируется на обучении молодых грифонов ценным профессиям. Это самая популярная реформа, которую Katerintreue когда-либо принимало."
KAT_stahlfabrik_katerinburg:0 "Сталелитейный Завод Катеринбёрга"
KAT_stahlfabrik_katerinburg_desc:0 "Шахты Андоршадта теперь обеспечивают столицу надежным источником руды, ее избыток подсказал промышленникам Katerintreue идею. Стальная фабрика в столице станет наиболее современными зданием во всем княжестве, а так же причиной огромных расходом. Но долговременные перспективы, предоставляемые этим сооружением, серьезно перевешивают изначальные затраты на постройку."
KAT_steam_pump_land_reclaimation:0 "Механическая Мелиорация Земель"
KAT_steam_pump_land_reclaimation_desc:0 "Благодаря увеличению "налоговых" поступлений, началась закупка некоторого количества грузовиков, тракторов и паровых насосов, дабы очистить заболоченные земли вокруг столицы. Эти машины не только послужат увеличению числа пахотных земель, но и придадут большой импульс индустриализации по всей стране. "
KAT_bribe_those_with_power:0 "Подкупить Власть Имущих"
KAT_bribe_those_with_power_desc:0 "Хотя Katerintreue обладает существенным влиянием на законы Катерины, оно все еще не имеет абсолютной власти в государстве. Часть благородные лорды все еще жалуются на ситуацию в княжестве, а некоторые даже смеют писать об этом в столицу, требуя действия. С новыми налоговыми поступлениями, мы можем разобраться с этим."
KAT_loyal_gang_bosses:0 "Лояльные Лидеры Банд"
KAT_loyal_gang_bosses_desc:0 "Обычно доверие к лидерам бандитских шаек является не очень мудрым решением, но текущая ситуация в Катерине далека от нормальной. В частности, несколько лидеров банд, с которыми мы работали в прошлом, показали себя грифонами, с которыми приятно работать. Особенно, если мы предоставим им некоторый "стимул"."
KAT_serfs_clear_marshes:0 "Крепостные Очистят Болота"
KAT_serfs_clear_marshes_desc:0 "Для спасения княжества от бедствий, мы должны принести жертвы. Обширные болота Катерины можно использовать можно было бы использовать с большой выгодой, если бы мы смогли выполнить опасную задачу по их осушению. В сравнении с грядущими экономическими выгодами, которые принесет нам это начинание, жизни нескольких крестьян - жалкая копейка."
KAT_increase_peonage_conscripts:0 "Увеличить Призыв Заключенными"
KAT_increase_peonage_conscripts_desc:0 "Нынешние вооруженные силы, находящиеся под прямым контролем Katerintreue, прямо говоря жалки. Если мы собираемся вернуть контроль за провинцией, наши войска должн быть радикально увеличены. Хотя вчерашние заключенные и не лучшие солдаты, они замечательно пополнят наши ряды."
KAT_ganger_armies:0 "Наказание за Неверность"
KAT_ganger_armies_desc:0 "Мы долгое время смотрели сквозь пальцы на самоуправство, которым занимаются наши союзника-бандиты, настало время дать им понять, что их верность и компетентность - единственное, что держит их на этом свете. Княжество будет навсегда очищено от недостаточно эффективных или нелояльных бандитов."
KAT_rough_diamonds:0 "Неотшлифованные Алмазы"
KAT_rough_diamonds_desc:0 "Мелкое дворянство Катерины годами сражалось и правило сельскими землями, многие из них обладают большим опытом, в чем абсолютно превосходят среднего призывника. С достаточным количеством тренировок и чувством дисциплины, эти лордики могут стать чем-то более эффективным."
KAT_investigate_knights:0 "Суд над Рыцарями"
KAT_investigate_knights_desc:0 "Благодаря усилиям наших агентов в рыцарских орденах, мы собрали достаточно "доказательств" их "преступлений", чтобы начать публичное расследование их прегрешений перед Катериной и ее жителями. Если все пойдет хорошо, последний соперник Katerintreue будет навеки ослаблен."
KAT_punish_disloyalty:0 "Бандитские Армии"
KAT_punish_disloyalty_desc:0 "Хотя у них есть свои особенность, нельзя отрицать, что лояльные нам банды на голову превосходят старую крестьянскую милицию почти во всем. Эти отряды оказались столь эффективны, что идея полностью разогнать милицию и заменить ее бандами на постоянной основе звучит неплохо."
KAT_warlords_of_katerin:0 "Военачальники Катерины"
KAT_warlords_of_katerin_desc:0 "Теперь, когда милиция полностью замещена своим бандитским аналогом, проявились некоторые особенности новых войск. Хоть они и закалены в битвах, конкурирующие банды скорее будут сражаться друг с другом, чем с врагом, а их лидеры ожидают большей автономии, чем старые офицеры. Таким образом, Катерина была разделена между этими военачальниками, каждый из которых фактически является вассалом Katerintreue."
KAT_clean_the_ranks:0 "Очистить Ряды"
KAT_clean_the_ranks_desc:0 "Бандиты Катерины превратились в достаточно эффективную военную силу, но стало очевидно, что в их рядах полно ленивых и некомпетентных грифонов. Эти грифоны отныне бесполезны, и их бывшие товарищи с радостью избавятся от этого мусора."
KAT_clean_house:0 "Очистить Дом"
KAT_clean_house_desc:0 "Теперь, когда лучшие из бандитов твердо верны Katerintreue, мы, наконец, имеем возможность убрать оставшихся врагов из княжества. Несколько оставшихся свободными бандитов, те дворяне, что еще не с Katerintreue и любой член двора, слишком лояльный принцессе, судьба их всех отныне предрешена."
KAT_block_resources_out_east:0 "Эмбарго Востока"
KAT_block_resources_out_east_desc:0 "Несмотря на все наши усилия, рыцари остаются последним препятствием между Katerintreue и полным контролем над Катериной. Мы сможем избавиться от него, лишь заставив их поднять полноценное восстание. Заблокировать снабжение их земель будет хорошим началом."
KAT_a_test:0 "Проверить Рыцарей"
KAT_a_test_desc:0 "Хотя Принцесса быстро теряет свою важность, ее эксцентричностью еще можно воспользоваться. Возможно мы должны прислушаться к ее приказам рыцарям сделать что-то настолько безумное, что они будут вынуждены отказаться. Это определенно станет тем катализатором, что мы ищем."
KAT_depose_katalina:0 "Низложить Диелзу"
KAT_depose_katalina_desc:0 "Время пришло. Каждый грифон, обладающий влиянием, хочем чтобы принцесса Диелза ушла, в то время как сама безумная принцесса настолько заблуждается в своих иллюзиях, что считает что все еще контролирует княжество. Ее время вышло! Неважно какие различия у нас есть, ни один грифон Катерины не возразит против этого."
KAT_a_new_dawn:0 "Новый Рассвет Над Катериной"
KAT_a_new_dawn_desc:0 "Теперь, когда безумная принцесса больше не стоит на пути, а прелат и рыцари ослаблены, Katerintreue стал полноценным властителем Катерины. Новый рассвет разгорается над пустошью, ведомый Katerintreue, готовыми пожинать плоды своего долгого труда."
KAT_the_spanner:0 "Пригласить Промышленников в Совет"
KAT_the_spanner_desc:0 "Ряд богатых промышленников Катерины выразили свою обеспокоенность тем, что их интересы не представлены в Katerintreue должным образом. Действительно, самые успешные грифоны Княжества должны иметь донести свой голос до правительства, особенно если они предложат некоторые стимулы."

#Second tree with regency.
KAT_form_the_council:0 "Form The New Regency"
KAT_form_the_council_desc:0 "With the mad princess consigned to the annals of history, the time has come for Katerin to receive a government that is, at the very least, not headed by an insane head of state. Several interest groups seek representation on the council, from religious socialists to the knightly orders that have maintained what little security there is to find in Katerin during Diellza's reign."
KAT_host_the_prelate:0 "Host The Ex-Prelate"
KAT_host_the_prelate_desc:0 "Heinrich Duskfeather is the former prelate, and an immensely powerful griff within Katerin, and through him, it would be possible to gain the support of the public. Inviting the griffin to dinner would be a good start indeed."
KAT_delegate_power:0 "Delegate More Power"
KAT_delegate_power_desc:0 "Former Prelate Duskfeather has shown a most useful aptitude for the matters of state, managing to quickly and efficiently go through the many daily tasks that are required to keep the principality functioning. It would be foolish to let such talent go to waste, and delegating more power to the old prelate would surely make the Katerintreue more popular amongst the clergy."
KAT_clergy_in_ktreue:0 "A New, Socialist Clergy"

KAT_find_suitable_prelate_desc:0 "When the old prelate was cast out, there never was a replacement chosen for him.

KAT_liberate_the_south:0 "Liberate the South"
KAT_liberate_the_south_desc:0 "To ensure that our fledgling republic can be safe we must move south and strike to secure the Scheißwald along with the surrounding regions. Too many threats are resting too close for comfort there, and if we do not move decisively, we may well spell our own undoing."

KAT_liberate_the_north_desc:0 "The northern Herzland was among our fiercest opponents during the revolution, be it the proud hounds of Bronzehill, the staunch Feathisians or the zealous Strawberry knights.

KAT_unite_heezlands_republic_desc:0 "Even during the Revolution of 978 did we ever reach this far. The Herzland has been well and trully freed from the aristocrats and the tyrants.

KAT_fate_of_grover_vi_republic_desc:0 "The claimant to the Griffonian throne, the very symbol of all that was wrong and twisted about the empire, is a young child not even close to maturity.

KAT_status_of_the_new_republic_desc:0 "The Katerin republicans are different from the old school Kemerskai republicans. While the pinciples of Liberty, Equality and Prosperity are ironclad, the question is how these can be the most effectively reached.

KAT_doctrinal_development_desc:0 "Despite being more naturally suited to the skies than most species, excessive altitudes can still heavily hamper a griffon pilots capabilities in the field.

KAT_CAS_projects:0 "Claws of Iron"

However she was not impressed with the amenities of the Halls that had already existed. In response she had numerous Griffons pulled from across the Principality to tear down the oldest of them and construct a new grand hall. However, with little time to plan and complete the project, the concept had to be based on designs made years ago. While the laborers were worked for every single day with no rest until it was completed, lest the Principality face the wrath of Princess Diellza. By the end of it, numerous workers had vanished, been executed, or simply worked to death, but the Princess had her Ball."

katerin.9.d:0 "News rarely reach Katerin quickly, but this time it only took a week. A messenger made his way down the Griffking river and then through the marshy roads to reach Katerinburg and deliver the news in person to the Princess. He had been sent by Wingfried von Katerinburg, the Princess' cousin who was a member of the Knights of Hellquill and the infamous Reformisten. Pompously and proudly he told that her cousin was now the Grandmaster of Hellquill. However, Diellza seemed to care little, merely smiling a bit. But then it's as if she remembered something and said: "Oh, I almost forgot! I need to invite Wingfried to my wedding as well! Now he has a high enough rank to be a prestigious guest worthy of my husband."\n\nNo one really knew what wedding she was talking about, before she revealed her plans to marry Glitterhoof, a unicorn skull which Wingfried had gifted her years ago. She ordered the messenger to deliver an invitation to the wedding to Wingfried and that it would be held in a week."
katerin.9.a:0 "Well that was unexpected."

katerin.10.t:0 "An Invitation From Katerin"
katerin.10.d:0 "Soon after assuming power, Grandmaster Wingfried sent a messenger to Katerin, to inform his cousin Diellza von Katerinburg that he was now a mighty Grandmaster. However, when the envoy returned, he delivered a message that wasn't a congratulations like Wingfried had expected, but an invitation.\n\nPrincess Diellza was inviting him to her wedding with Glitterhoof, who would become the Prince of Katerin. At first, Wingfried didn't recognize the name, before remembering it was a unicorn skull Wingfried had gifted to Diellza several years ago. He knew that his cousin had grown oddly fond of the trophy, but now she wanted to marry it? Truly, she had gone completely insane like he had feared.\n\nThe messenger asked if he would accept the invitation. While Wingfried felt sympathy for his cousin, he also found it despicable that she would love the remains of a filthy pony so much. He hoped her cousin wouldn't be too upset if he said no..."
katerin.10.a:0 "Politely refuse the invitation."

katerin.11.d:0 "As the messenger returned to Katerinburg his earlier conviction was gone, replaced with fear. As he appeared before Diellza he was afraid, indeed terrified, and the glee with which the princess received him did not help. Diellza was bouncing from excitement as she asked when "Wingy", her childish nickname for her cousin, would arrive for the wedding. When the messenger finally managed to give the news - that Wingfried was not going to show up - the glee vanished, being replaced with silent, mounting rage. Quickly excusing himself, the messenger rushed out in order to be out of range when the princess' disbelief was traded for rage. \n\nRetreating to her personal quarters, Diellza grabbed the nearest piece of decoration - a princeless crystal vase - and threw it into the wall with all her might. The explosive display of rage continued for hours as Diellza thrashed every last piece of decoration in her chambers as well as many pieces of furniture. None of the servants in the castle entered until well after the screaming and crying had stopped, and they found Diellza sitting on the floor, whining to herself as she rocked back and forth, clutching Glitterhoof close to her. Quietly, they listened to her whispers before retreating, choosing to spread what she had raved about on instead of daring to challenge her. All friendly ties to Hellquill was to be cut off, with any Hellquillians within the nation's borders being treated as persona non grata from now on. Also, the expected wedding between Glitterhoof and the Princess was postponed for the forseeable future.\n\nIt was, after all, what the princess had commanded."

katerin.16.t:0 "The Alchemist returns to the Princess"
katerin.16.d:0 "Princess Diellza held court every single day to hear the pleas of her subjects, on paper that is. In reality the Princess' court, in the rare few days she decides to show up to it, is a strange and unnerving proceeding. Most of the nobles avoid making anything more than a token appearance at them, as any slight interaction with the Princess has the potential for a lethal result. There seems to be no rhyme or reason to her actions, and asking her to judge on anything was to invite disaster. To take a recent example, a griffon who had lost all of his belongings to bandits was sentenced to prison for not having protected his own property.\n\nOnly the truly desperate approached the mad princess when she presided over court, which made it all the stranger when a griffon fitting none of those descriptors approached her openly. The potion salesman hailed from Yale, and had operated within Katerin for a time many decades ago as the court alchemist for the Princess' father. The aged griffon carried with him a suitcase, and contained within were three vials which he hoped would, at the very least, soothe the princess for a while.\n\nThe alchemist proceeded to present the vials to the princess, and he made it clear to her that only one could be chosen, as mixing potions rarely had good results. Firstly, there was the vial that came from the north. It had the most brilliant aquamarine color the court had ever seen, and even still as the liquid was within the vial, strange patterns seemed to appear within the fluid if one looked at it long enough. \n\nThe next vial came from the south, concocted within the alchemist's laboratory within Angriver. The dark green liquid within seemed to move on its own, swirling around within the vial even when no outside force was acting upon it. The vial itself was hot to the touch, and it was clear that the liquid within was far from dormant, although the alchemist assured that it was safe to drink.\n\nLastly, there was the vial that hailed from the west. Unlike the others, the liquid within this vial seemed completely inert. It was completely clear, colorless and lacked any odor to speak of as well. No matter how long the vial was studied by the nobles, it seemed no different than normal drinking water. Perhaps that is what made it the most frightening of all the liquids to some. After all the liquids had been presented, the time had come for the Princess to choose which one she would drink."

This has apparently caused an uproar, with half of the vassals seceding from the Empire. Imperial authority was slowly falling apart, and whether Katerin liked it or not, it had quickly become clear to the Katerintreue council that they could no longer rely on the Empire. In silent discussion, the issue of telling Princess Diellza was soon raised. Her authority was still absolute, after all, and a servant soon headed for the princess’ quarters to inform her.\n\nTen minutes later, as the servant’s body was hanging from the gallows outside the palace for the crime of displeasing the princess, the news was already spreading among the people as well, leaving the already suffering people to fall even deeper into despair. Those few who had hoped that some day, at some point, the Emperor could have intervened against their mad ruler were forced to face the bleak truth.\n\nNo one was coming to save them now."

katerin.18.d:0 "Princess Diellza had been working hard the last few days, managing the principality was no easy task after all, and she had decided to take a day off from her duties to enjoy with her paramour Glitterhoof. The dining hall in the palace had been reserved for this occasion, and she had made sure to select only the very best delicacies for Glitterhoof. And with the preparations for the dinner complete, the time had come for her date with Glitterhoof to begin.\n\nThe hall itself was decorated in the most lavish manner possible, with colored banners adorning the walls, and portraits of Diellza's honored ancestors watching over the dining table. The appetizers of tonight's meal already adorned the table, as the palace's cooks had, on Diellza's orders, spared no expense in preparing for tonight's feast. The princess entered the dining hall, clothed in one of her more ostentatious dresses, and took her seat at the end of the table.\n\nAs she took her seat, she spotted Glitterhoof on the opposite end of the table. The skull was freshly polished for the occasion, and even had a rather expensive looking hat on. The princess started eating her meal and quickly decided to strike up a conversation with her date. "So how are you enjoying the feast Glitterhoof, I trust that everything is to your satisfaction?"\n\nThe Skull wasn't very talkative.\n\nThe lack of a reply from Glitterhoof did little to deter the Princess, who cheerfully continued to speak. "Oh my, I can see that you haven't even touched your portion of the meal, Don't worry dear, I'll make sure that the cooks are suitably punished for serving food that is so antithetical to your tastes."\n\nThe rest of the date went in much the same way, with the Princess having a seemingly infinite capacity to talk to the skull. The palace guard could do little but watch, and quietly inform the cooks that they best make themselves disappear before the meal is over."

katerin.19.t:0 "A Duet with Glitterhoof"
katerin.19.d:0 "The invitations sent out for the ball had been at very short notice, but all the same the vast majority of the nobility had turned up. There were few safe reasons to ignore the princess, after all. Yet, at first it seemed that they were blessed with an evening of relative normality. The food was as lavish as it ever had been, the entertainment fine indeed and even Diellza seeming to be in one of her good moods, even if she had that skull close by at all times.\n\nAs the evening's entertainment was mentioned some of them noticed that Diellza had departed, and no one thought too much about it at first. As it turned out though, the entertainment was provided by the princess. Stepping onto the stage, she began to sing, accompanied by the string quartet next to the stage. She had a fine enough voice, few would question that, but the piece she sang was a duet and they saw no one else up on the stage with her. Unless one counted the skull of course, but surely she could not...\n\nOh Boreas...\n\nAs it turned out, she could. As Diellza's part ended she turned to look to her skull, holding it aloft to the crowd as silence settled over the entire hall except for the accompanying music that played through the second verse, with Diellza picking up at the third. If she was aware of the fact that she was performing in front of a mortified crowd of nobles that only wanted to sink through the floor and disappear she didn't show it, only carrying on through all eighteen of the verses."

katerin.20.t:0 "A trip to the Katerinburg Library"
katerin.20.d:0 "The princess had been sitting in the library for most of the day, devouring books as she was wont to do in her more peaceful moments. It had turned into a ritual for the castle, a few hours of guaranteed peace as their capricious ruler was off invested in the books of distant lands or strange mysteries that could absorb her so. Today, this peace was shattered though as Diellza came striding out of the library and summoning the guards, ordering them to bring "everyone" to the library "to enjoy it as well".\n\nThe pattern was all too familiar: the princess had gotten an idea and wanted it executed. Unless you wanted to be the one executed, you obeyed, and soon hundreds, indeed thousands, of griffons all around Katerinburg were marched from their homes into the great library. There they were told to "read" the books by armed guards.\n\nDiellza, standing on the second floor, oversaw the entire crazed affair, randomly pointing out griffons who seemed insufficiently overjoyed by her gesture of kindness and ordering them whipped. In the end, the few literate commoners around hurried to grab the nearest book, forming impromptu reading circles, with others clustering around them to listen, hoping that they could satisfy their insane ruler."

katerin.21.t:0 "The Divine Pretender-Kings"
katerin.21.d:0 "Former Prelate Duskfeather has travelled Katerin and beyond during the years after he was deposed, and he has seen much all across both Katerin and indeed the empire. He has seen a nation slowly rotting from the inside out, not roused out of its stupor more than briefly when the revolution of 978 threatened to undo it, after which it sank back into its slumber. The emperor was useless, that much had stood clear to him, but even worse than that had been the pathetic state of the temples. Should they not have rallied to the people's side to help them? Should they not have encouraged the nobles to live up to the principles of the gods? Should they not have done anything other than continue playing power games in their palatial temples?!\n\nIt was then that he had come into contact with a griffon who had introduced him to the ideals of socialism. He could barely even remember the griffon's name, it had been a brief encounter. Mikhail something? Yet, the book he had given Duskfeather had felt like it tore away the veil from his eyes and let him see clearly for the first time ever.\n\nIt had been a long and trying walk to reconcile the radical preachings with his faith, but he had seen the truth in the end: Be they emperor or archon, there was never going to be peace for the common griff, the one that suffered more than anyone else, as long as the old order was in place. The archons were not absolved of their crimes, but rather even more guilty for their part in the suffering. The question was rather who was truly blameless in this situation."

katerin.22.d:0 "The barn was packed to the brim with griffons, all of them having come of their own volition from all over the countryside and gathering to hear the words of the wandering former Prelate. Having gone from being a distant authority figure to the nearest thing the desperate griffons of Katerin had to a listening ear, he was like water to a parched throat for the countless griffons who had, for years and indeed decades, endured nothing but insanity and tyranny.\n\nHe spoke of things that would earn any regular griffon a place in the noose; of how the nobility were no more worthy than regular griffs, of how the injustices of the world could be overcome by the righteous and of how the people of Katerin were worthy in the eyes of the gods. He told them how to rise above the suffering they were living though and how to form their own local governments to let justice and law rule them, not capricious madness. Katerin's people could stand on their own four legs, he said, and they should do so if that was what it took. As in the distant land of Stalliongrad, where the ponies rose up to claim their own fate when their leaders forgot them, so could the griffons of Katerin assert their own power."

When the by then seven year old Diellza von Katerinburg was crowned, a regency council had been created to make sure that the affairs of state flowed smoothly, even though their legal ruler was a child. They had been advisors only, quickly reiterating their loyalty to the rightful princess, even as she slipped deeper and deeper into madness. They were loyal griffons after all, they were true. \n\nYet, true to what? Meeting under the cover of darkness, an assembly of the highest nobles of the land debated this question silently that night. They were still advisors and respected members of the principal council, but that wasn't enough any more. Diellza was only becoming more and more unpredictable and confused, and for the good of them all, it was time for them to take more direct control of the affairs of Katerin.

It has been sufficient for Katerin's needs, but the times are changing here too.\n\nWith the Katerintreue's plans to forcibly industrialize the nation one thing will be needed above all others: cheap labour. In order to effectivize the farming system and build a new industrial base, the sharecroppers must go.

They may not be wealthy, but they are many, and they are organizing themselves.\n\nIn addition to this, the Knightly Orders of Argentumdämmerung and the Silberkralle have each established firm power bases of their own across Katerin during these last years, and while the charitable Silberkralle have many differences with the militant Argentumdämmerung, there is plenty of reason to presume that they will gladly close ranks if threatened. Maybe even with the peasant revolutionaries?\n\nTo address this issue, August Gottschalk has proposed a simple solution: to begin courting those who might aid us and offer them to join the Katerintreue. It is risky, but the Katerintreue's position is too weak to get picky about allies."

Maybe apologists could have said that it was an attempt at diplomacy and to build unity, or that she was the princess so surely she knew best, but the bandits disproved the notion rapidly. As the soldiers, by royal decree, retreated from their bandit hunting missions, the various bandit groups used the opportunity well, launching a campaign of terror and theft across most of Katerin. Villages now burn in the night and hundreds, if not thousands, have seen the open invitation in the princess' declaration and taken to banditry as well. Whatever headway done thus far is gone, and the bandit issue is worse than ever before."

katerin.54.d:0 "The gates outside the castle was seething with people as a crowd of peasants were loudly protesting outside. The line of soldiers in front of it would have opened fire, were it not for the presence of the former Prelate of Katerin. The ex-prelate, Heinrich Duskfeather, stood between the soldiers and the crowd, clutching his walking staff as he glared them down, stopping any of the soldiers from even dreaming of actually firing their guns.\n\n"Who among you hold authority?!" he demanded of the guards, "Where is your captain?!" He stood firm, reiterating the question until the royal guard captain came out from behind the line, ordering him to disperse the crowd. "You claim no authority over me, or the people of Katerin, other than what we indulge you to have, whelp!" Duskfeather snapped in response, leaving the entire line of soldiers to actually shiver in fear.\n\n"Unless madness has spread through the castle, your masters are still sane enough to understand their actions! They may cower behind their fragile claims to authority, but the gods see! The gods see and the gods WILL judge them, as will the people if they push hard enough! Woe unto your masters, for those who play with fire will get burned. Unless your cowardice is as absolute as your masters, tell them this. The people are watching, and the people will not suffer this much longer!""

katerin.55.d:0 "Strathburg was a town in the middle of a painful and sudden transformation. Industrialists connected to the Katerintreue had shown up only a couple of weeks ago, with armed griffons, and they had papers from the government that gave them right to seize the properties of several of the townsfolk to clear space for their new factory. Tensions were running high throughout the towns, with more than one group of peasants having gotten into fights with the guards before being scattered by the soldiers.\n\nFrom atop the chapterhouse, Grandmaster Erik Grimclaw stared down at the scene as it was playing out. He sneered in silent contempt as the industrialists, griffons invited from Flowena or Skyfall, came and drove honest Katerin griffons from their homes by force. The law was on their side, but Grimclaw wasn't naive enough to think that this would solve any of the problems that the Katerintreue were whipping up. Already he could tell that this wouldn't stop with fistfights and turned to one of his knights, ordering him to rally every available knight in the chapterhouse. It seemeed the Argentumdämmerung would have to calm things, and also remind those agents of the Katerintreue that they were not as invincible as they thought."

Only the Silberkrallen have historically shown much interest in the region, even placing their chapterhouse there to better guard the southern flank of Katerin. Yet, not even Lingermill has escaped the changes in the nation as of late. The new road that has been built from Katerinburg to Andorstadt has opened up the region for development, and already prospectors and surveyors have been coming to the area.\n\nGrandmaster Hector Ardensson sat by the new bridge, watching the griffons that were arriving in greater and greater numbers with every passing day. It should be cause for celebration, certainly, but considering the state of Katerin, he couldn't help but worry. This road had robbed the locals of the distance they had had to Katerinburg, and now that was torn away from them and opened them up to the iron claw of tyranny. Staying trapped in the past was no way to live, yet right now he could only worry over what he could only see as a danger to many of the griffons of this region, griffons he had come to see as kin."

Their chapter houses in Katerinburg have been closed down and the knights arrested, with all loyal citizens of Katerin being ordered to assist the crown as it investigates these claims. Despite the urging of her advisors and the Katerintreue, the princess was utterly unwilling to show any consideration for the sensitive political situation and has brute-forced the issue.\n\nAs it has turned out though, whatever she hoped to achieve has not come to pass. Instead, most of east Katerin has rather rallied to the knightly orders' side. With little royal authority remaining in both Strassmark and Lingerbill, the Knights are all that the people there have to rely on, and they are sticking by their saviors' side."

With the Argentumdämmerung and the Silberkrallen both choked, it is hoped that they will bow their heads and be more malleable to the royal will and also that it will placate Diellza enough to not send the army after them."

The Silberkrallen were in part formed to act as healers and guardians of the sick, and they take their commitment to the weak very seriously. Meanwhile, the Argentumdämmerung splintered off from the Hellquill order, and have never lost their militant edge. Tensions run rife between the orders and the Katerintreue knows this well. \n\nUsing contacts and plants among the knights as well as buying off local bandit tangs, the Katerintreue have begun whipping the east into a frenzy, hoping to overwhelm the orders and cause enough tension for them to break apart. Already, arguments have broken out between the knights and in one case a Silberkralle physically blocked the Argentumdämmerung from executing a captured bandit.\n\nIn response, the grandmasters have decided to, for now, unite the orders. They must have one doctrine and one commander, not two, and yet the issue of which and who have kept this from happening already. As things are going though, a decision must be reached. After days of debating, the choice has been made."

katerin.61.d:0 "The Silberkrallen and the Argentumdämmerung had decided to meet at one of the former's local chapterhouses, a large, two-story house that had been converted to a hospital for the locals. It had taken some time after the Argentumdämmerung's arrival for the Grandmaster of the Silberkrallen to appear though. Yet, when one of the Argentumdämmerung knights had left the room where they stayed to drag the Silberkrallen's leader to the meeting he had found Hector Ardensson in the middle of surgery and been cooly informed that if he entered the disinfected area Hector would not hesitate to slay him on the spot.\n\nAfter an hour, as Hector entered the meeting room, he bowed his head to Erik Grimclaw, his equal among the Argentumdämmerung. "Master Grimclaw, it is good to see you again. Also, my apologies for the threat levelled against your subordinate."\n\n"Normally I would demand satisfaction, but there are greater issues to deal with right now. I will not beat around the bush: that madgriff in Katerinburg and her sycophants will be the death of us. You know this, do you not?" he asked, Hector sighing in response.\n\n"I know... just one more of the countless ills plaguing this nation, and this one there is no balm for. I believe I know what you are imagining, but I would like to hear it from you all the same."\n\n"I am not fond of you, nor are you fond of me. Your knights consider mine bloodthirsty barbarians, and we consider you naive and weak-willed, but Katerin needs all the champions it can get. Grandmaster Ardensson, I, Erik Grimclaw of the Argentumdämmerung, offer to stand by you as an ally and as a brother. For Katerin, I will be the sword and you will be the shield. Let our differences strengthen us in this struggle ahead."\n\n"Grandmaster Grimclaw, I, Hector Ardensson of the Silberkrallen, accept your offer. Let your knights undo the villains who would threaten the people and let mine bring solace to the suffering."

The gates of the palace were not battered down, but opened, and the steps up to the main keep was not contested by guards, instead they were the ones opening the doors.\n\nThe limit had been reached for all of them, and on this day the reign of the mad princess was finally ended. Not a single shot was fired, nor was any blood spilled, as there was no one willing to stand on Diellza von Katerinburg’s side in this moment, and as the palace guards broke past the barricaded door into her room, it was to arrest her on the spot.\n\nAs it turned out, it would not be so easy for the revolutionaries. The princess was gone, as was Glitterhoof, and a window swayed slowly open in the wind. For the first time in decades the mad princess had actually left the castle, abandoning it to the revolution.

Diellza had been captured alive, if exhausted, and was being transported to the castle. A sigh of relief went through the chamber, with all the present griffons visibly relaxing. The topic soon came up of what punishment would be issued, with many favoring the death penalty for the tyrant. It was at this point that Hector Ardensson stood up, scanning the crowd before shaking his head.\n\n"Is that not an easy solution?" he asked the crowd. "Cut her head off, think that the matter is settled and move on as we invest all our sins in her, leaving nothing for ourselves." His words caused a stir, with one of the representatives asking him what he was trying to imply. "I am implying that we are prepared to murder someone for convenience, not justice. How many people have Diellza killed? Wrong, the answer is none. She has not killed a single griffon. Every last victim of her terror was murdered by soldiers, agents and loyalists. They were the ones who carried out her bloody madness."\n\n"Let me also stop those among you who are going to cower behind the witless excuse of her being the legal authority. A fine authority that was too; a six year old broken girl, forced onto the throne to lead instead of being given time and aid to heal from the loss of everyone she ever loved. You, Sheriff of Katerinburg, did you not murder dozens on her orders? When a desperate, traumatized child lashed out at the world, did you not close your eyes and heart, claiming you were innocent because you just followed orders? What of you, general? Or what of the Katerintreue? And if so, are we not all innocent? She was the legal authority of all, and does not then every last griffon of Katerin carry no responsibility for the pain and misery wrought? Has for all these years Diellza been the sole griffon in Katerin with the ability to make her own choices and to bear the consequences?"\n\n"I think not. We carry blame as well, in various amounts, but we are speaking of moving on. Of not seeking to extract brutal justice, but offer a new beginning in which old grievances are left behind. If we are serious about that, then that applies to her as well. We are not going to allow her to rule in any way, shape or form again, let that much be clearly stated. Rather, she will be instituationalized and given what healing we can give. Whatever happens though, we are NOT going to murder the broken woman who was shoved onto the throne and then meekly indulged through an ocean of blood because we were all too terrified to consider any alterative!""

katerin.65.d:0 "The knight was staring down at the sight before him, having imagined the end of this by now weeks long hunt in many different ways, but this option had eluded his fantasies. Diellza von Katerinburg lay at his feet, her legs trapped and from what he could tell broken under the fallen tree. She was still breathing, only barely, as she weakly clutched that skull of hers to her chest. Grabbing his radio and calling the others to him, he watched her slowly turn to look at him\n\n"Are you from the palace?" her voice was weak and cracked, as if she had screamed for hours.\n\n"I am, and you are going back to be judged" the knight answered atonally.\n\n"I understand...  It is only right..." after a few seconds a strange sound came from Diellza, one that made the knight look up at her. It was a sob. "I’m sorry..." she said, tears trailing down the sides of her face, "So much death... I’m so sorry... You’re one of the Argentumdämmerung... aren’t you?"\n\n"I am..." the knight said, unable to muster much more in the way of a reply. He didn’t recognize the mad princess at all. He had worked in the palace for years, but nothing like this had ever shown itself in her.\n\n"Please...kill me," Diellza whispered "They should have killed me back then. Then I wouldn't have lived in this... haze... for so long... I survived... only to make everyone else suffer. Please..." she begged, tears flowing slowly down her face as she stared up at the sky. "Kill me... I want to die while I am still me..." she begged, clutching Glitterhoof close to her chest."

It was animal panic that drove her and every sound from behind her only further inflamed it. All she knew, in her terrified, near mindless, state, was that she had to flee, she had to get away, they couldn't capture her!\n\nYet, the masked griffhunters that followed her were as fast, if not faster, and they split up as they drew nearer to their quarry. One of them keept up the wild chase and turned to the left to overtake her and drive her to the right. Readying the rope, he could almost feel the gusts of wind form her wingbeats as he drew nearer and nearer, and when his colleague tackled her from the side, having rushed ahead to hide, he was on her in an instant.\n\nDiellza gasped wordlessly as the air was knocked out of her lungs and she crashed onto the forest floor with a loud thud. Glitterhoof rolled away from her into the underbrush, and before she could do anything the three griffhunters were all on her, gagging her and binding her claws and wings so they pushed against each other to immobilize her. She tried to struggle, weak cries of fear and desperation escaping the gag, but the masked griffs paid her no mind as one of them lifted her onto his back to drag her back to Katerin and the awaiting council."

It would not do for the griffon who had been entrusted with Katerin's future to lose his composure easily... and yet by the gods he struggled in this moment.\n\nHe found himself remembering an old memory, a dreadful memory that he had long wanted to leave in the past. He remembered a young girl barely six years of age, standing in from of him in a bloodied dress and with something broken in her eyes. That had been the first time he saw Diellza, and though he had pitied and sought to aid her for years, there had never been enough time. The darkness in her had only grown and in the end it had consumed her, leaving her a bloodthirsty madgriff. In the end he had made a choice: trying to continue reaching out to her, or fight for those who suffered under her tyranny. He had chosen the latter, and thrown himself into it with all he had. No more hesitation, only action. No more compromise, only righteous fury.\n\nHe held quietly onto this ideal as he looked up at Diellza's broken body where it hung from the noose, slowly swaying from the branch above. Below her, the skull that she had cradled so obsessively lay shattered to pieces. He slowly looked around himself, meeting the eyes of one farmgriff after another, seeing how none of them could bring themselves to meet his eyes.\n\n"The villain will incur his debt to the gods, and they claim it with interest." His voice carried across the subdued mob. "But woe betide him who interferes with divine justice, for he carries the gold of his soul in a flimsy purse. You slew her not in a court of justice, but mad rage. Begone, and pray for Boreas to give you the perspicacity you lacked today."\n\nSilently, the mob that had all but torn their hated ex-monarch to pieces dispersed, leaving only the old prelate to stand there, watching the swaying corpse in front of him before lowering head and finally allowing his feelings of shame and disgust to well up inside him. Action and rightous fury he had called it, but all he saw here was blind rage."

Finally, sanity has returned.\n\nOthers are not just feeling hope though, but are sensing an opportunity. The Council rules for now, but will they have what it takes to hold onto power?  Even more importantly, do they have the right? Duskfeather, the once Prelate of Katerin, does not think so, and none has earned more loyalty from the peasants than him. The Knightly orders of the Silberkrallen and the Argentumdämmerung stand equally suspicious of the council’s intentions. Did they simply trade the mad princess for a bickering group of powermongers? Plans will have to be made, deals struck and support built. Katerin is not truly delivered yet, and nothing is certain right now for the tormented principality."

As the friend was smuggled into Katerinburg, Hector met him in the doorway with a smile.\n\n"It has been too long my friend. Let's get you a meal after the road and we can talk. How was your journey here?"\n\n"A pain," the old griffon answered, "there's a lot of borders between here and Cloudbury. Tell me what you are planning while I'm eating.

While the ex-prelate had the common griffon on his side, he didn't have the military might. While the knights had the military might, the peasants under them could be whipped into obedience. Neither side has been able to contest with the true rulers of Katerin, and now it is time to do away with the pretenses of being just an advisory council. Katerin needs no other masters than the Katerintreue and as its rightful rulers they will be the one to dictate all policy and all laws of the nation from now on."

katerin.127.d:0 "Like bleating cattle, the populace have been led astray by mollycoddling knights and raving old priests for far too long. The council is in no position to discipline them yet though, instead they have to apply a lighter touch. After all, starvation and bandit attacks are adequate enough reasons for why the people have lashed out against their rightful masters. The solution is simple though: give them food and give them cheer.\n\nThe Katerintreue are in a good enough position to requisition food from their "associates" among the knights and even the prelate's griffons, for now at least. This should take the worst edge off the starvation that Katerin faces.\n\nThere's also quite a few prisoners across Katerin, be they bandits or political rivals. Instead of carrying out executions in the capital only, the Katerintreue have decided to carry out the executions publicly and in the nearest major settlement, all so that the people can see the decisive action taken to protect them. Throwing in some strategic rewards of local authority figures for their dilligent service should make sure the populace feels respected, fed and protected enough to sit still in the future."

Weeks of preparation have been devoted to making sure this happened on schedule, and griffons have lined up for hours by the ballot boxes.\n\nThe results, however, were less than stellar. In Marchtetten, almost a fourth of the ballots were spoiled due to an overflowing bathtub on the floor above where they were kept. Two griffons were arrested in Andorstadt after they were caught "correcting" ballots and in Einfoort, the voting office somehow managed to set itself on fire. Grandmaster Ardennsson has ordered for another round of voting, sending out observers to make sure things are done properly this time around."

This constitution has been drafted over many months by Hector Ardensson's republican contacts, been approved by him and is today, in a grand ceremony with all the premier leaders of Katerin, signed into effect.

No one expected them to be anything more than historical curiosities, but Erik Grimclaw's agents have scoured the nation, managing to find them all and bringing them together into a comprehensive document that clearly lists the Grimclaw family's historical claims to the throne and the unjust methods by which they had been deposed.\n\nWith this paper having been published all over Katerin, the people are now well-informed of their new king's right to the throne. Adding in the immense levels of resentment the von Katerinburg family has built up in these last decades, it has been a simple matter to convince the vast majority. They are no longer condemned to bow their heads before a deranged woman who could just as well order them hanged for no good reason.

A righteous king must be firm but he must also be caring: if there is too much or too little of either of them chaos will follow, as has been so clearly demonstrated.\n\nWhile he would not usually condone such methods, the time has come for leniency with the peasants, not harshness, which they have known too much of already.\n\nSpending money from the royal coffers to rebuild the nation, bring in food for the suffering, lowering the bread taxes and sponsoring festivals among the people will all help to build up the broken spirits of the commoners so that they will serve the nation better. Even an animal will rebel if it knows only the whip, and these griffons are not animals, they are the subjects a righteous prince are entrusted by the gods."

Katerin is a country that's no stranger to suffering, but the news out of Einfoort has terrified even the fatalistic Katerinians. From what rumors are telling, plague has struck the city, and the official response - denouncing the rumors as simple attempts to spread discord and fear among the people, has not helped."

katerin.136.t:0 "The Situation"
katerin.136.d:0 "The decaying settlement of Einfoort lies south of the capital. The city itself seems to be representative of Katerin as a whole, its glory days are long behind it, with years of neglectful rule and exploitation having taken a heavy toll from the once burgeoning settlement. The once proud walls of the keep have been in a state of perpetual disrepair for the last 20 years, doing little to discourage any potential attacker. The city itself has grown far beyond the boundary of the walls, with villagers fleeing from bandits and the plague taking refuge in an ever-expanding network of tents and shanties.  The city is in ruins, all that remains is its decaying cadaver, and the vultures have come to feast.\n\nWith the constant stream of refugees to the city, it was inevitable, the plague has come to Einfoort. If the city, and more importantly its inhabitants are to be saved, then decisive action must be taken.\n\nWhen news of the plague arrived at the capital, the knightly orders of Katerin stood ready to secure the city at a moment’s notice. The orders have served the principality with an upright zeal for centuries, dedicated to upholding a tradition of chivalry that stretches back hundreds of years. Two major orders have established themselves within the Principality, and both have volunteered for the task.\n\nFirstly, there is the venerable order of the Silberkralle, led by the honorable Grandmaster Hector Ardensson.  The Silberkralle acts as the sword and the shield of the common griffon, striving to make the life of the peasants as comfortable as possible given the circumstances. The Silberkralle desires to calmly and carefully take control of the city, minimizing the danger to the common folk and granting those too sick to survive a merciful and peaceful end.\n\nThe other knightly order of Katerin, the Argentumdämmerung has also volunteered for the task. Led by the fervent Grandmaster Erik Grimclaw, the foremost objective of the Argentumdämmerung is to pull the plague out by its roots, and reclaiming the deadlands of Katerin for the Empire. What they lack in experience they make up for in zeal, and they seek to drag the plague from the city as quickly as is possible, minimizing the risk of infection for the populace.\n\nOf course, the Orders could always be dismissed and Einfoorts garrison given the task of restoring order, but the garrison was already small and poorly maintained before the plague hit, and there is no telling what methods they might resort to."

katerin.137.d:0 "When the orderly columns of the Silberkralle marched into Einfoort, many of its citizens saw them as divine saviors sent by Boreas himself. The Silberkralle is well known for its compassion and sympathy for the lower classes of Katerin, and their arrival gave the desperate populace of the city the glimmer of hope that they had desperately been seeking. The order was quick to officially relieve the beleaguered garrison of the city, who were immensely pleased that the city was now someone else's problem.\n\nA curfew was shortly enforced across the city, with the Silberkralle restoring order to the streets with efficiency, yet not without compassion. The Silberkralle have been understanding but firm, seeking to separate the diseased from the healthy and allow them to live out their final days in peace. The citizens of Einfoort were undoubtedly put at ease due to these efforts, there was a deeper meaning to them.\n\nThe Silberkralle carries with it a secret objective, they seek to establish the exact cause behind the infection, and the mysterious plague that Katerin has suffered for so long. The Knights have questioned every single sick griffon they have found with vigor, trying to find the root of the infection, and the route through which it first managed to arrive within the city.  Time will tell what secrets they uncover."

katerin.138.d:0 "The Knights of the Argentumdämmerung entered Einfoort in a somber but disciplined manner. They paid no attention to the unwitting bystanders who thought help had arrived. They knew that their task would be a bloody one, that in order to save the city, the rot that lies at its core must be pulled out, and that there would be no avoiding collateral damage. But they were resigned to their bloody task for if they did not carry it out, then who would? The knights would do whatever needed to be done but they would take no pleasure from it.\n\nThe Grandmaster of the Argentumdämmerung himself, Erik Grimclaw, was leading them. He was not one to shy away from such a challenge, and he would not dream of making his loyal knights carry alone the burden of such a task. The Grimclaws could trace their ancestry all the way back to the founding of Katerin itself, and although they had lost control of the principality, the last scion of the Grimclaws still wielded great influence within his homeland.\n\nThe knights quickly took the reins off the garrison and moved to secure every quarter of the city. Every single house was to be searched for any trace of the infection, and those of the sick deemed to be beyond saving were granted a merciful end at the claws of the knights. Einfoort would be cleansed, nevermind the cost."

Fearing that the zealotry of the Orders would only serve to increase the damage and that entrusting such a task to the garrison of the city would result in the least amount of damage to the city. But none could predict what methods the garrison would resort to, the means by which they would purify the city of the diseased. \n\nThe problems started only a few days after the garrison was given the task, when food shortages combined with a fear of the plague caused a panic amongst the peasants. The garrison found itself overwhelmed and was ultimately forced to retreat within the crumbling walls of the keep while the riot burnt itself out. This incident was clearly the last straw for the garrison, who perceived their position as untenable. Fearing for their lives and becoming ever more paranoid of the plague, the garrison took the only option that made sense to them.\n\nThey burnt the city to the ground. Gathering the remaining oil and torches contained within the keep, the garrison procededed to methodically walk through the city, setting everything they encountered ablaze, and killing all those who resisted. \n\nThe plague is gone, and Einfoort along with it. All that remains of the city are burnt ruins, and whatever poor wretches who managed to escape the blaze."

katerin.141.t:0 "A Meeting Outside Einfoort"
katerin.141.d:0 "It had been a few days since the Argentumdämmerung had arrived in Einfoort and the situation had been strenuous since. The members of the Inner Circle present met in their tent outside the city to discuss the situation. Among them stood the young Grandmaster Erik Grimclaw. Barely older than a fledgling, he stood out amongst his elders. But he embodied the idea that in souls nobly born, valour does not depend upon age. Next to him sat Eggert Von Strathburg and Gunter Drakkenwald, the two highest ranking knights of the Inner Circle. Von Strathburg had conducted the first actions in the city and his face was still veiled by grief over the death of several of his subordinates. Gunter had arrived only the day before at the head of the relief force but still managed to make himself unwelcome by criticizing the infirmaries set up by Von Strathburg’s griffs.\n\nThe knights opened their meeting by a prayer. After, Grimclaw gave the floor to Eggert. He proceeded to paint a bleak portrait of the situation. He reminded the Circle of some of the atrocities his knights witnessed in the city from some of their inhabitants. In his eyes, Einfoort was virtually lost and needed to be treated not as a city to relief but as a target to tackle with brute force. To save Einfoort would require to save it not only from the plague but from itself. Several knights banged the table in approval and Grimclaw himself seemed to agree with Von Strathburg but Gunter asked to speak. The Grandmaster allowed him.\n\n“Brothers and sisters, Grandmaster. There is no question about the valour of our knights and their sacrifices in Einfoort. Yet, I fear that we have wrongly took our Grandmaster’s call for crusade too literally. One does not tackle a plague city like a rebellious uprising. We need to care for these griffons and act with a cool head.”\n\nEggert scoffed at the remark “How dare you, brother? If you had indeed showed up in time, we might not be in the situation we are in.” Gunter glared back at the griff. “Tread carefully, Eggert. If you think boasts of brashness will grant you authority, let me remind you we are not tavern drunks listening to stories.” Eggert put his claws on the table and rose up. “I will not take insults lightly from a coward!”\n\nGrimclaw rose his claw and demanded silence “Enough.” Gunter and Eggert obeyed and sat down. “My father had absolute trust in your valour and competence. This much I know. So remember your oaths. Both sides have merit and we must stand together because..."

katerin.142.d:0 "As the news of Einfoort's ultimate fate spreads around Katerin, panic enveloped the populace. The government had never held the best interests of the lower classes in mind, but the griffons had never imagined that it would perpetrate such a blatant atrocity against its own citizens. The common griffon had already known that the military would do little to protect them against bandits, but now every single garrison was a collection of murderers and madmen. Protests over the bonfire of Einfoort erupted in the major cities of Katerin, and those protests soon erupted into riots, ones that had to be dispersed by force.\n\nThe citizens of Katerin now flook to anyone who promises to save them from the claws of their government, with both of the Knightly Orders have received a large boost in applications to join. But not every griffon can count on the protection of the knights, limited in griffonpower as they are. For these poor wretches, there is nothing to protect them if the nearest garrison were to turn on them. They yearn for something to protect them from the abuses thrust upon them by their government and grow more radical by the day."

katerin.143.d:0 "After weeks of ceaseless work, the Silberkralle's efforts have born fruit. Locking down Einfoort and setting up impromptu hospitals to treat the sick and the dying, they prevented the situation from escalating into chaos. Indeed, at several points volunteer knights walked into the most plague-ridden city blocks to stay with the people there, soothe their worries and convince them to stay together, care for each other and not spread the disease any further. \n\nWhile many knights caught the plague themselves, and many of those knights died, the Silberkralle's devotion, medical knowledge and tireless efforts has stopped the plague from spreading beyond Einfoort. As the situation stabilizes, the Silberkralle have been preparing to depart again, leaving only a small group of knights behind to keep an eye out for any additional outbursts of plague. As Grandmaster Ardennson put it, disease was just another enemy to fight for the people, and their duty is done."

katerin.144.d:0 "Under the leadership of Gunter Drakkenwald, the knights organized a vast plan to take back control of the streets. They enlisted the help of locals and peasants. Equipped with whatever tools available and gauze masks or protected by cloth dipped in vinegar, they began to clear the streets of whatever blocked them. Corpses were taken away to be burnt. Trash and boulders from various ruins were cleared. The infected people were brought to the dispensaries and homeless relocated to relief camps around the city to restore some semblance of order. Then pumps brought by the knights or salvaged from the local firefighters’ barracks were set up and slowly but surely, the streets began to be cleaned by the civilians under the protection of the knights. Fountains, wells and other water sources were either rigorously scrubbed or condemned. The task had not been an easy one and many of the workers fell ill themselves, despite the protections.\n\nWith the way now cleared, the knights set about establishing various outposts throughout the cities. The city’s squalor was far from purged but at least, they could now venture into the streets in a normal way."

This time, in force and with a clear objective cutting a way into the city. This was no easy task. The roads of Einfoort had become a mess of rubbles, abandoned carts, garbage and even corpses left to rot.\n\nFollowing a map drawn up by Gunter Drakkenwald, they got to work to clear the streets along specific lines. The peasants would gather all obstacles and burn them. In some places, buildings would be tore down to allow for easier and safer passage. As for the homeless, they were rounded up and lead to quarantined areas outside the city. The plan was to create a network to allow the Argentumdämmerung to move quickly in the city, control the movements of the population and institute a curfew. These new roads into Einfoort were quickly nicknamed the Sacred Way.\n\nAfter the knights were finally able to move unhindered once more, they spread the word to the population: the city was now under curfew. All those found in the streets during curfew would be considered rebels and shot at."

Volunteer knights walked into the most plague-ridden city blocks to stay with the people there, soothe their worries and convince them to stay together, care for each other and not spread the disease any further. Others lived in their gas masks for days and yet others quickly isolated themselves when signs of the plague appeared\n\nThe plague is slowly receeding, but the Silberkralle have paid for this victory with dozens of knights' lives, and they depart Einfoort a diminished chapter. Yet even as they do so, there are no signs of bitterness or resentment among their ranks, rather instead the knights have come out of it seemingly strengthened in their conviction, and the people are noticing this selfless sacrifice as well. Whatever the Silberkralle have lost in knights, they have gained in the respect of the people."

The most infected parts of the city were coinciding with the more unruly parts of the city, which, according to the locals weren’t even the old bad neighborhoods. Worse, some witnesses. While Eggert and Gunter were arguing about the value of their respective information’s, Grandmaster Grimclaw pounced on it with the confidence of youth.

They found perfectly maintained workshops in otherwise rundown neighborhoods. They had found nogriff there but some poor souls in cages, dead or in the state of apathy that characterized the late stages of the plague. Instead of tools, the buildings were full of strange substances, notably a strangle white-ish powder. One knight who grew up in a butcher’s family noticed how oddly close it was to bone meal. Documents were seized, written in a foreign language that nogriff seemed to recognize at first glance. And most ominously, they found crates of relief food, with markings from the temples of Eyr, the princely authorities or, even more worryingly, the knightly orders themselves.\n\nThe findings were put under the surveillance of selected knights unanimously trusted by the Inner Circle and all involved in the search were sworn to secrecy.

They knew that to call what they had over Einfoort control was overly optimistic and that it could easily be reverted. Some parts of the city were lost to the plague and unrest or were simply about to collapse or burn down, possibly taking entire blocks with them. They needed to take radical actions.\n\nThe knights had begun to mark down the situation of the city in the streets by painting symbols in Argentumdämmerung code over the doors and at the entrance of the streets. They also had at their disposals some maps that the scholars under Gunter had drawn up. Eggert then devised a plan and presented it to Erik who heartily agreed. He too felt that difficult measures had to be taken.\n\nOver the next few days, knights were ordered to begin to evacuate buildings and areas that were deemed too dangerous to be left alone. To prevent any delay, the knights were order to break in and order the immediate departure of the inhabitants. Those that did not would be forced out and put under quarantine.

So much still remained shrouded in mystery but one thing was certain a group was hard at work, corrupting and defacing Einfoort and Katerin. For what purpose but pure maliciousness? That, they were not yet sure. Neither was what they had to do next.\n\nErik had tried his best to unite his knights but despite his popularity, he just couldn’t get his griffs to see eye to eye. He had forced Gunter and Eggert to work together but they had only radicalized as things went forward. Gunter was still convinced that Einfoort could still be saved. That what they needed to do was simply to go in and cut off the head of the salamander. He had some support. The strange happenings had brought some of the more experienced knights to his side. Eggert, on the other claw, had grown increasingly frustrated to see so little progress, so many half-measures to save a city that didn’t seem to even want to be saved. Einfoort had resisted. Knights had fallen to petty criminals during evening patrols and civilians were routinely showing disobedience to orders. Einfoort had taken its toll on the Argentumdämmerung and Eggert was determined to put an end to all of it. And he was strongly supported.\n\nErik knew that if he continued to try and balance the two, the credit his knights were giving him thanks to his birth would eventually run out.

Among these, few are as bad as the Maarites, those fallen griffons who pledge themselves to the great adversary that is Maar. These griffons have only one purpose in life, to dominate and to pervert all that is good, and there can never ever be peace with them. Such is the nature of the griffons' faith, and while other gods may exist and be honored, none surpasses the Trinity."

katerin_new.5.t:0 "The Fate of Grover VI"
katerin_new.5.d:0 "One of the big concerns for Duskfeather had been the young claimant to the Griffonian Empire; Grover VI. What was one supposed to do with that boy? Killing him was out of the question, and neither would he lock the boy away to end up another Diellza, traumatized and insane. No, instead he had taken his time, repeatedly, over the weeks that had passed, to devote a little time here and there to talk with the child.\n\nWhile Grover had treated him coldly, the boy was at least impeccably polite and had answered when given a gentle push. What more, as Duskfeather had chosen to not be threatening, but simply let it take time, he had managed to get a glimpse of the boy's sharp mind. Also, the boy was surprisingly pure-hearted, only wanting to "help people" as he had called it.\n\nFor these reasons and several others, Duskfeather arranged for the boy to be made an acolyte in the temples. He would be given a new name to protect him from those who may wish him harm and be trained to serve the people as a priest. His father's sins were not his, and he deserved a chance at a good life."

katerin_new.6.d:0 "The Temples have always been important parts of Griffonian life, but in this new order they are more vital than ever. The priests are no longer merely spiritual guides, but they have come to hold more and more poltical power as well, acting as speakers of the local peasant councils, performing certain government duties and seeing their temples be more and more integrated to truly be the centre of their communities.\n\nAlso, many aspects of life presumed purely mundane affairs have fallen under the temples' purview as well, all being made to serve the greater cause of religious socialism. Many curse the new regime, but they do it silently, for there are many more who have come to find peace, or even purpose, in this new regime."

katerin_new.7.d:0 "In the dead of the night, a single griffon stood in front of the altar to Boreas, silently praying. Heinrich had taken to rising before dawn for a long time, meeting the rise of the sun in prayer, just as how he did when it set.\n\nThe more the faithful revolution grew, the more it garnered attention, little of it positive. They occupied an unique position, it seemed. The faithful saw in the revolution a threat to an artificial hierarchy they were insistent the gods had handed down, and the revolutionaries were so obsessed with the temporal that they could only imagine the divine as shackles.\n\nIt saddened him to see how those he would gladly have called comrades believed him some deranged preaches that corrupted the revolution for his own end. What end? He lived humbly as he always had, built no statues of himself and while he carried a symbolic title, he was merely a teacher to the people. Certain things were unavoidable, and just like how capitalist societies in the end built themselves towards oppression, the gods were the final arbiters of right and wrong. In socialism, the griffons had found the closest thing to a morally pure society where the gods' message would not be corrupted by powerbrokers. He had realized this slowly, and painfully, and he wished that those who fought for the common griffon saw that as well. Yet, if they didn't, he needed to stand up to them, like he did to the tyrants who oppressed and murdered his flock."

katerin_new.8.d:0 "One should think that Heinrich Duskfeather, Emperor-Archon of Griffonia, would find confidence in what he had achieved, and yet all too often in his prayers he only found doubt. Had he chosen the right path after all? The Three would judge him as much as anyone else, and whatever delusions mortal griffons trapped themselves in would wither in front of them. So he spent the early morning praying and thinking, never allowing himself to silently start claiming infallability but instead revisiting his shames and his failures again and again.\n\nThis night the memory of Diellza von Katerinburg had come to him as he recalled the first time he met her: a four year old girl who had, as her first words to him, said that she already could write her name and wanting to show him. Remembering what had happened with her and how her limp, battered body had swayed in the noose, left a stab of shame pierce through him even now. Whatever excuses he could pull up felt hollow, they still had ended with death and blood.\n\nAnd much death and blood had he wrought since? Once, merely armed conflict had bothered him, now he casually declared wars. He stood on a precipice to becoming a monster, and he had to pull back from the edge and remember why he fought. Not vengeance, but justice, not condemnation, but redemption, and if he forgot a single, suffering child because he was too focused on the grand scale... was he different from any Emperor?"

When you were tied to the land, you adapted to it after all, and he had long since realized that trying to enforced strict orthodoxy would be madness. People in the far north and the deep south were not the same, for their lands had made them different, and to ignore that was arrogance of the highest order.\n\nTherefore, as the faithful marched onwards, he had called for them to remember that while certain things that belonged to the old order of tyranny needed to be thrown down, most things would be simply people like them adapting in their own ways, and for these customs to be left in peace. The Trinity was the Trinity, but beyond that there were countless deities, and to enforce only one faith was no different from enforcing reactionary autocracy."

Of course the parasites were complaining that justice finally caught up to them, what else could anyone expect?\n\nThese estates had lived off the labours of others for centuries, and they weren't going to let it go lightly. Why would they? Their entire world was built on domination of those who should be their brothers and sisters.\n\nFortunately, they were no longer the ones with the power, and Heinrich knew how easily he could crush them. Order the holy revolutionary army to intervente, crushing any resistance and chasing them out with only the clothes on their backs. Their lives were build on theft, after all.\n\nStill... he remembered Diellza, remembered how she was forced into a situation where she could only become a monster, and yet again the question of blame rose in him. Could they even have changed their paths in life even if they had wanted to? Maybe some leniency was still in place? Or maybe that would just be an insult to those he had sworn to fight for."

How much pain has not been caused because the Empire was built on blood, making ambition something necessarily blood-soaked if one wanted to reach beyond one's birth in life?\n\nNo more though, from now on, our people will be free to pursue prosperity and happiness freely instead of being told to know their place.

Few could fault those who resigned themselves to their fate in times such as these.\n\nYet from the swamps of Katerin, to the great streets of Griffonheim, the erudite halls of Yale and the depths of the Sheisswald, one thing has stood clear for the all world to see. No matter how dark the night has become, the griffons of these lands are not broken, nor are they simply resigned to their fate. I see not cowed peasants, but a people with the strength and the dignity to rise up, again and again if has to be, to fight for what they believe in.\n\nI will not be here for long, maybe even in the next election the people will choose against me, and I will gladly step down then, for I have seen the measure of those I can now call fellow citizens.

How many would want to style themselves emperor in these times? Tens, maybe hundreds even. They are not going to be meekly subdued with words, but by blood and iron.

Grover stuttered, trying to repeat the lines he had been taught but stumbling over the words. \n\n"You aren't," Erik countered. "Your father let the empire fall apart in his claws, and thousands lie dead because of his weakness. I reunited the Herzland, and I brought order to it. You played with your toys as it all happened. What have you ever done for the people of these lands?" Erik pressed the boy, who failed to answer. "I will answer the question for you: Nothing. Even now you cower before me: those are not an Emperor's mannerisms." \n\nGrover, still but a child, found nothing to say even as the words stung deep in the little boy. After a while his beak began to slowly quiver, tears welling up in his eyes. Erik reacted to this by reaching for the sword on the table beside him and putting it down in front of the boy. \n\n"If you truly claim youself to be a king, then learn to fight," He instructed young Grover. "On your eighteenth birthday I will face you in single combat. If you defeat me the throne you claim will be yours, but if you fail you will leave Griffonia, never to return. Pick it up if your words are more than lies."\n\nSlowly, Grover picked up the sword, a servant ushering him outside as Grimclaw looked after him with a small smile. In some ten-odd years a inexperienced boy would face the Grandmaster of the Argentumdämmerung.

They were the powerbrokers of the Herzland and, by extension, most of Griffonia, but that put them under scrutiny of a kind they had not faced before. Maybe certain griffons would disapprove of how Diellza had been handled, or raise questions about how the national tax revenue was distributed.\n\nThankfully, there were enough loyal griffons available to them that as they had the archives quietly sealed and taken away to be burned, few raised any issues. Griffons needed to vanish too, there were too many out there who knew things. The Argentumdämmerung and Silberkralle were all but irrelevant these days, but that didn't mean they were harmless so they had to go. The same went for Heinrich Duskfeather, and to make doubly sure their bodies needed to vanish too.\n\nAlso, with their agents busy throughout the Herzland clearing out any evidence of their previous actions, the council had all the time it needed to assemble a second force that would, no question asked, hunt down the first set of agents after they were done.

One had to be able to congratulate oneself sometimes, and the good folks from Katerin took it upon themselves to live up to their standards.\n\nThe palace was sumptuous, the cherubs on the ceilings were decorated with gold leaves imported from Bronzehill. It reflected its shimmer upon the grand orchestra playing the old anthems. In the center of the room, a giant ice swan was slowly melting. Griffons weren’t even paying attention to it though, they were too busy adjusting their robes. The theme of the soiree was "Famous Griffons and their attributes", so of course, everygriff came in dressed as themselves; a practical joke they all quite enjoyed.\n\nThe delicious food was abundantly displayed on large tables or carried on trays by lesser nobles. "At least they get the imponderable honor to be present!" a griffon laughed. The circle around him joined in the hilarity. "Well, they can marvel at this fine reception. It’s probably the only time they’ll have the honor. Better them than… The poor." A chick gasped in the assembly. "The mere thought… Have you heard, it seems they gathered at the gates.

A significant percentage of the people are going to become reliant on the food dole, meaning that being able to eat is quite literally in the government's claws as the whining out in the factories about higher wages will come to lack credibility.\n\nAdditionally, the lower grade grains, fruits and the likes that usually would have been used for livestock and the likes can be mixed into these things, allowing for a nice little profit margin that can go into the Herzlandtreue's pockets. Food for the people, lower wages for the industrialists and a well deserved reward for the wise Herzlandtreue."

### Leader descriptions ###
kat_crazy_chick_desc:0 "As one of the last surviving members of the von Katerinburg family, Princess Diellza carries a legacy 300 years old. Her family was among the first who pledged allegiance to the Grover dynasty and for their loyalty they were rewarded the principality of Katerin. During Diellza's childhood, however, tragedy befell the family during the revolution that struck the empire. A mob stormed the von Katerinburg castle, seeking to overthrow the princely family. When the smoke cleared, the six year old Diellza was the only one still alive, even as she was imprisoned by the revolutionaries.\n\nAfter the revolution ended and Diellza was freed something had broken inside the girl. As the only remaining von Katerinburg, she was raised to the throne as Princess of Katerin, even as the trauma she had experienced began to manifest itself.\n\nEver since, Diellza had been quietly referred to as "the mad princess" as her mannerisms have become more and more erratic and violent. Nowadays her subjects live in constant fear of triggering a violent outburst from her, and though she goes from relatively lucid to enraged madness regularly, it is impossible to predict when and what does it.\n\nOne of the few things that seem to have a stabilizing influence on her is "Glitterhoof", a pony's skull that was given to her as a macabre gift from her distant cousin Wingfried von Katerinburg. Whatever the intent behind the gift was, Diellza always carries it with her, treating "him" like a stuffed animal and referring to the skull as her fiance. This, combined with her unpredictable and violent mannerisms has made her feared and hated among a people that once respected the von Katerinburg lineage, and it is doubtful if Diellza is able to comprehend this."
kat_uthor_desc:0 "As the Grandmaster of the Silberkralle, Hector Ardensson is a knight and physician in equal measure and is held in high regard by most in the country. Born in Strassmark in 945, Hector had just become a knight when the revolution swept the empire, Katerin included. While he fought on the counterrevolutionaries' side, the many atrocities he witnessed and the longstanding suffering of the people left him disillusioned with the old order, and even as he was part in restoring the nobles' power, he began to harbour republican sentiments himself. At least they spoke of the people's suffering, and at least they tried to relieve it.\n\nEver since, Hector worked tirelessly across Katerin, trying to help the suffering people and mitigate the worst of Diellza's excesses, but in the end that wasn't enough, and he found himself forced to act more directly for the sake of the people he swore so long ago to safeguard and help."
kat_arthas_desc:0 "Erik Grimclaw - a descendant of heroes and kings both - might be young, but under his lead the once fading Argentumdämmerung was revitalized into a fighting force equal to any other order in the Empire. While stern to the point of harsh and with little patience for failure, Grimclaw has earned the respect of most around him for his military acumen and ironclad principles. One might not find him pleasant, but no one can call him unreliable.\n\nWith all the chaos and discord that has reigned across Katerin, the need for order has never been more obvious, and Grimclaw is the griffon to provide it. The von Katerinburgs have failed the nation, and maybe it is time for the lineage that ruled these lands before the empire to take over?"
kat_crazy_old_bird_desc:0 "Once one of the preeminent prelates of the Temple of Boreas, Heinrich Duskfeather could well have carried him all the way to the position of Archon. Yet, inside the temple hierarchy as much as outside of it, the political games played are vicious, and Heinrich underestimated his roval, the prelate that would become Eros VII. Losing not only the struggle for the Archon's seat, but his position as a prelate as well, he was left destitute and banished from the temples as Eros made sure to not just defeat but crush his opposition.\n\nIt was at this time, during his darkest moments, that he met a certain griffon during a train trip, one that gave him a book on socialist philosophy at the end of it. The disillusioned and destitute ex-prelate was captivated by the ideas discussed in it and started to slowly reevaluate many ideals he had held.\n\nIn the end, when he returned to Katerin, he had concluded that the very structure of the temples meant that the kind of power games that had seen his downfall were not simply a part of the temple hierarchy, but rather a cancer that is rotting the temples from within, just like how the nobility is a cancer upon the people.\n\nDrifting through Katerin, he preached not from a grand altar, but at the kitchen tables and at the marketplaces of the common griffon, seeing the suffering that the nobility wrought upon the people and how the churches didn't fight this suffering as much as teach the people how to accept it.\n\nIt sickens him, and he has long since realized that this order must be torn down, by force if no other option is available."
kat_mean_council_desc:0 "The Katerintreue council was born out of the various influential noblegriffs who after the revolution acted as regents for the six year old Diellza von Katerinburg. Power, however, is an addictive thing, and after Diellza reached adulthood these griffons didn't simply step down. They remained as "advisors" and "aides" the the princess, even as they slowly began to weave a complex web of laws, deals and legal judgements to entrench themselves more and more. While Diellza was still the sovereign of the nation, they slowly became the ones who held the actual power.\n\nThere is little in the way of ideological foundation or greater goals within the Katerintreue. Instead, power is everything to them, indeed it is their birthright as the greatest minds Katerin can produce. Within the council, those who lose their grip on power will be discarded and those who stubmle will be used by others. Griffons join and fall out of favour with the Katerintreue constantly, and the only reason that the Katerintreue has not collapsed into infighting is this very balance of terror between the various members; no single member can threaten the balance without being turned upon by the rest of them, and for unscruplous power-mongers like the Katerintreue there is no reason to challenge the system as it is, not when it enrichens them so."

 EAW_WS_TAB_3_TXT:0 "\n\n£eaw_text  §YEquestria at War§! incorporates a fork of §YExpanded Technology + Industry + Equipment§! by §YGreatexperiment§! (used with permission), that has been edited and streamlined to fit our design goals better. This allows for a longer game with more technologies to research.\n\nEaW introduces §YMagical Equipment§! and a new resource - £resources_strip|7  §YCrystals§! - used to produce it. §YMagical Equipment§! provides a more resource, IC-intensive, less reliable, but more powerful alternative to regular §YInfantry Equipment§!.\n\n§YPre-Industrial Infantry Equipment§! and §YArtillery§! have been added, to represent the weapons used by nations that have not yet industrialized.\n\nFurthermore, EaW introduced the §YRaces§! system. Each country has one of six races - §YPony§!, §YChangeling§!, §YGriffon§!, §YDeer§!, §YDiamond Dog§! or §YUnspecified§!, with more races planned. Each race has its own unique racial tech tree folder, and in some cases racial unique units. Races cannot be changed during the game (exception being an option for the §YChangeling-Olenian Commonwealth§!).\n\n\n\nIn order to better represent the differences in industrial/societal and research development of nations in Equestria at War, §YDevelopment§! and §YScientific Development§! idea categories have been implemented.\n\n§YDevelopment§! represents the general state of industrialization and advancement of economy and society. Low levels of §YDevelopment§! impose §RIndustry§!, §RResearch§! and §RPolitical§! maluses. §YDevelopment§! can be improved by §YNational Focuses§! or §YDecisions§!, depending on the country.\n\n§YScientific Development§! represents the level of education and research capabilities of the nation. Low levels of §YScientific Development§! impose §RResearch§! maluses. §YScientific Development§! can be improved by §YNational Focuses§! or §YDecisions§!, depending on the country. For §Ygriffon§! countries, owning major centers of learning in Griffonia can be used to improve §YScientific Development§! as well.\n\n\n\nThe potential of nuclear warfare and the horror of unleashing such terrible weapons is not quite seen in Vanilla. In order to rectify this, EaW introduces the following changes:\n- Nuclear attacks will now reduce the population of a hit §Ystate§!, using believable casualty numbers depending on state population and development (using multiple nuclear bombs on a state in short succession will not reduce population as drastically).\n- A §Ystate§! hit by a nuclear attack will receive the §YFallout§! state modifier, reducing state factories, supplies, division organization and increasing division attrition. The modifier will last for a §Yyear§!. Subsequent nuclear attacks will not stack the modifier, but will reset the one year timer.\n- Production of §Ynuclear bombs§! requires a supply of £resources_strip|7  §YCrystals§!. If none are available, no new §Ynuclear bombs§! will be produced. Each §YNuclear Reactor§! consumes 12 £resources_strip|7  §YCrystals§!.\n\n\n\nAfter a country has been defeated in a war, and a peace conference has ended, the victors will have a chance to receive §Yone-time 50% research speed bonuses§! to §Ytechnologies§! that the loser had researched, and the victor has not.\n\nThe chance to receive the bonus is random, and calculated per technology. The more of loser's §YIndustry§! that has been taken over by the victor (either by puppeting or annexation), the higher the chance to receive a bonus, which means that not every victor will have an equal chance. The level of §YDevelopment§! of the victor is also a factor - the worse the Development, the smaller the chance.\n\n\n\nAn effort was made to improve the AI. While it is by no means perfect, and most of the real improvements can only be implemented by Paradox, we have done our best to tweak AI's behaviors, and improve AI's handling of Division Templates. AI will use all of the added units and technologies. AI will intelligently choose Doctrines based on the bonuses they recieve in their Focus Tree. AI will use dynamic strategies to respond to events and changes on the world stage. Peace Conference AI has been improved, though it is not perfect.\n\n\n\nSince 1.6 Ironclad update, new Game Rules for various countries and game setups have been added, to allow the player to customize their £eaw_text  §YEquestria at War§! experience.\n\n\n\n£eaw_text  §YEquestria at War§! provides a new, flavorful system of general, admiral and, for players with the La Resistance DLC, operative generation. Various nations will generate different leaders of different races depending on their circumstances. For example, a nation may have both pony and griffon generals, or use multiple namelists. This does not carry any gameplay changes."

 # Continent
 EAW_WS_Zebrica:0 "Zebrica - Crossroad of Civilizations"
 EAW_WS_Zebrica_desc:0 "Zebrica is a vast and diverse continent, home to more races than both Equus and Griffonia. It is also almost as large as the other two combined. Its climate ranges from the tropical jungles of §GHindia§! to the scorching deserts of §YZebhara§! and to the frozen swamps of §CCape Hestraya§!. Its most advanced societies are comparable to Equestria in their prosperity, while the most backwards ones are little more than isolated tribes. As such, there is little one can say that applies to the continent as a whole. However, Zebrica is a sum of its parts, and each region has its own shared culture and history.\n\nWestern Zebrica is the land of the horses, the larger cousins of ponies who also live there. Besides them, there are sentient cats who walk on two legs in §CAbyssinia§!, and the warlike donkeys of §gAsstyria§! and §gAnseruk§!. Most of the region was once united under §GSaddle Arabia§!, but over centuries of decadence and decay the old empire broke apart, and in 1007 is divided into a brutal civil war.\n\nSouthern Zebrica is more diverse, with zebras, hyenas, gargoyles and centaurs living in the cold south. Besides these races, there are also the yeti of §CStormland§!, a ferocious race who united under the black banner of the §CStorm King§! and wrought havoc across half the continent. However, Storm King perished in battle, and now the yeti race is divided, and previously conquered races hope that he will never have a true successor.\n\nCentral Zebrica is dominated by the Zebhara desert, but also has the Great Lakes. The §YMazwi Empire§! united the zebras of the Lakes, but the Storm King's invasion brought an end to its reign, and now zebra warlords fight each other to determine the fate of the region. While most of the population here consists of zebras, there are also the camels of Camelkand in the east, but most of them live under the reign of a Storm King's general who forged a kingdom of his own through conquest.\n\nThe north has closer ties to Equus and Griffonia than the other regions, and thus is home to many naval powers. The coast is primarily inhabited by zebras, while the islands are home to hippogriffs and harpies. A small holdout of Equestrians exists in §gChiropterra§!, worshipping Nightmare Moon and biding their time until her return. In the northeast, the native deer of the Hindian subcontinent chafe under the yoke of Olenian conquerors, while the llamas of the mountains live in peaceful solitude, worshipping their ruler as a god.\n\nEastern Zebrica is generally considered the most backwater region, which is why Storm King avoided it almost entirely. Zebras, giraffes and kirin call this region their home, but in recent times Feathisian griffon adventurers have carved realms of their own, looking for treasure and valuable goods to trade. They are attracted by rumours of a §YGolden City§! hidden somewhere in the magical jungle of the south-east. The kirin have so far lived in isolation, but they are slowly opening up to the outside world.\n\nYet all this only scratches the surface of Zebrica. It has numerous nations and tribes, each with their own story to tell, and their own path to follow."
 
 # Regions
 EAW_WS_Northern_Equestria:0 "Northern Equus"
 EAW_WS_Northern_Equestria_desc:0 "The frigid and mountainous north of Equus is an inhospitable landscape, but hardy races have lived there for a long time. Yaks, polar bears and penguins have adapted to the cold temperatures, yet more recently waves of griffon settlers arrived in the region. Legends also say how ponies once lived here, back when the climate was warmer, but now only ruins remain after all the ponies migrated south.\n\nThe yaks were until recently united in the isolationist kingdom of §CYakyakistan§!, but as Equestrian influence continued to grow in the region, the more conservative yaks of the §CJaki-Clan§! rebelled. A brutal war followed, but neither side was able to overcome the other so a temporary peace treaty was signed. Further north, there are the §gPolar Bear Communities§! which were founded only some years before. Polar bears are used to being divided, so only time will tell if the newborn nation can survive for long. On the northeastern shores, the venerable §CKingdom of Pingland§! is facing a succession crisis as their old king is at death's door. South of them is the industrialized griffon colony of §YNova Griffonia§!, left stranded as their colonial overlords in the east have utterly collapsed. Now the independent griffons must determine their role on the world stage and learn to live by themselves. Meanwhile their small autonomous territory, the §OGriffon Frontier§!, is far too busy dealing with bandits and worse. Without Nova Griffonia's support, they will likely collapse.\n\nThe northern nations are free, but for how long? The great powers of the south see them as little more than useful pawns for the upcoming battles. They are relatively weak and underdeveloped, and thus remain vulnerable for now. The mountainous terrain makes defence easier, but unless the north manages to unite one way or another, they do not stand a chance against the south."
 EAW_WS_Southern_Equestria:0 "Southern Equus"
 EAW_WS_Southern_Equestria_desc:0 "Because the nations south of the northern mountains in Equus are so large, the entire half of the continent is regarded as a single region. As the area is so vast, there is a huge variety of climate and terrain, ranging from the cold marshes of the north to the hot deserts of the south. Three races dominate the region: Ponies, changeling and deer. There are also insignificant minorities of buffalo, dragons and griffons. The ponies live on flat plains, arid drylands and sparse woodlands, the home of the deer is in boreal forests, tall mountains and swamps, while the changelings inhabit dark forests and marshlands. Each of the major races of the south have nations of their own.\n\n§YEquestria§! is by far the largest and most industrialized nation in the world, regarded as the haven of ponykind. Under principles of harmony, they have remained peaceful and prosperous for a millenium. Other pony nations on Equus are §CCrystal Empire§!, a close ally of Equestria which recently broke free from King Sombra's curse, §RStalliongrad§!, a breakaway Equestrian province and the cradle of communism, as well as tiny §gStarlight Town§!, a city-state which is recovering from the rule of a mad cult. In the northwest, the deer live under the rule of the §gKingdom of Olenia§! and its corrupt King, while the §GChangeling Lands§! were recently united and now seek to assert their dominance on the continent. Aside from these larger countries, there are the small §OBuffalo Chiefdom§!, a tribal enclave within Equestria, as well as the §RUnited Dragon Tribes§!, which recently had a pro-Equestrian ruler come to power.\n\nSouthern Equus used to be peaceful, but recent times have changed that. Stalliongrad revolted, Changeling Lands attempted to seize control of Equestria, and Olenia had a dramatic change of rulership. Now tensions remain high between the major nations. The changelings are building up for war while their rivals seem ill-prepared, as Olenia is weakened by internal instability and Equestria clings onto its pacifism. The smaller nations wait and watch, some of them deciding whose side to take in the upcoming conflict. Worse still, the major nations are among the most technologically advanced and industrialized nations in the world, so any wars between them would turn into carnage on an unprecedented scale. Some pray for tensions to dissipate and for peace to return, but as dark clouds gather, war seems inevitable."
 EAW_WS_Northern_Griffonia:0 "Northern Griffonia"
 EAW_WS_Northern_Griffonia_desc:0 "The cold lands of northern Griffonia have long been sparsely populated, as unlike in northern Equus arctic races did not settle the region. Instead, there were hardy griffons and ponies who migrated from west and south. Griffons settled the marshy valleys south of the §gWhitetail Mountains§!, while ponies arrived across the gulf to the frozen forests of the northern shores. Most ponies kept going, trying to find a better place to settle. Some remained and have adapted to the cold over the centuries.\n\nThese ponies are known as the §gNorthern Tribes§!, and lived in isolation until griffon revolutionaries crossed the mountains and carved out their own nation in §RSkynavia§!. The §GKingdom of Vedina§! has long stood independent, remaining autonomous during the Empire's reign, yet its distance from the griffon heartland means its inhabitants retain their traditions. Further east, the Duchy of Cloudbury fell after the remnants of the §OGriffonian Republic§! fled there. The revolutionaries now live in exile, hoping to one day return to Griffenheim. In the Whitetail Mountains themselves, there is the savage §YSunstriker Clan§!, nominally loyal to the Empire but likely to break free when the opportunity presents itself. In the northeast are the §YArcturian Order§! and the §gDread League§!, ancient foes stuck in the past due to their extreme isolation.\n\nThe griffons of the north were once subjects of the Empire, yet became independent after it fell. If the Empire were to rise from the ashes, their freedom would soon be threatened, and due to the poor and underdeveloped lands of the north, they have little strength to resist their might. Out of all of them, the Griffonian Republic is the strongest, but alone they stand no chance. Beyond the mountains, Skynavia and Northern Tribes are locked in bitter conflict as ponies try to push out the invaders while the griffons try to spread the light of communism to the dark north. Northeast, the Dread League is gathering its strength to crush the Order once and for all. After that, nothing will stand in their way."
 EAW_WS_Central_Griffonia:0 "Central Griffonia"
 EAW_WS_Central_Griffonia_desc:0 "While the authority of the §OGriffonian Empire§! collapsed everywhere else, it still exists in central Griffonia, albeit in a greatly weakened form. It is here, in the fertile plains around the mighty §CGriffking River§!, where Emperor Grover I established his capital of Griffenheim, and where the capital has been ever since. The region is densely populated by griffons, while diamond dogs inhabit the §OBronze Mountains§! to the north. In the east, the magical §LScheißwald forest§! has been a near insurmountable obstacle for griffon settlers for centuries, while the great §CLake Rumare§! and the mountains of §gBlackhollow§! make up the southern boundary of the region.\n\nAfter the §RRepublican Revolution§!, the region became greatly fractured. In §YHerzland§!, the Empire exists as a small rump state around Griffenheim, surrounded by nominal vassals who are part of the §OReichspakt§!. Further south, the Duchy of §YVerenia§! has been torn asunder by civil war between rival houses. The Kingdom of §YGriffonstone§!, left without its greatest benefactor, is stranded. The small barony of §GRumare§! now has a chance to save its dying culture, while Blackhollow in the east has been overrun by §gBlackrock's Bandits§!.\n\nWhile the Empire is weak for now, it may yet recover its strength. Should that happen, the vassals are in danger of losing their autonomy, and most of them will refuse to give it up without a fight. Unfortunately, Herzland can only be reunited through conflict. The same is not true for Verenia, where the civil war may yet find a peaceful solution. In the south, Rumare may seek to reclaim its claimed lands from Griffonstone, while Blackrock may have ambitions in the east - or be overthrown. All of these states have to be wary if the Empire reunites Herzland, for it may then seek to bring all former Imperial lands back to the fold. Aquileia and Wingbardy, too, may seek to expand their influence in the region, thus possibly sowing the seeds for a conflict between them and the Empire. It is hard to predict the future, but one thing is certain: There will be blood."
 EAW_WS_Eastern_Griffonia:0 "Eastern Griffonia"
 EAW_WS_Eastern_Griffonia_desc:0 "The region of eastern Griffonia is defined less by strict geography and more by the region's historical lack of influence by the §OGriffonian Empire§!. As such, it covers a large part of the Griffonian continent, and other races besides griffons live in these lands. Eastern Griffonia is traditionally divided into three sub-regions: §CEvi Valley§! in the south where griffons live along the Evi river and its many tributaries, §GRiverlands§!, a mountainous region populated primarily by ponies but also by diamond dogs and griffons, and lastly §LBeorgfordas§!, also known as Hill-land, home of the secluded hillponies. The source of the mighty §CGriffking river§! is in the mountains of the Riverlands. It flows westward, almost splitting the continent into two. Another notable feature in the region is the magical §GEygsic Forest§!, rumoured to be home to giant spiders.\n\nOverall, the nations of the region are more underdeveloped than in the west, primarily due to how far away it is from Equestria and other advanced nations. Out of the three sub-regions, the Riverlands are the most developed. Here, seven pony nations and, more recently, §gDiamond Mountain§!, are united by a defensive alliance known as the §GRiver Coalition§!. In western Riverlands, there are two griffon nations outside the Coalition: §gHellquill§! and §gLongsword§!, remnants of the grand crusades of Emperor Grover II. The southern coast of the Riverlands has three nations which sprung up after law and order deteriorated in the region, with a diverse populace of ponies, zebras, deer and griffons. The Evi Valley south of the Riverlands is more backwards than Riverlands, its griffons clinging strongly to their traditions. Some, however, want change, and already §YBrodfeld§! is engulfed in a brutal civil war against the communists of the §RGriffon Liberation Army§!. In the north, the hillponies have no such desire to embrace modernity. Their tribes are like a time capsule of a bygone age, with tribal chieftains holding to power under the protection of the River Coalition. Off the coast, there is the island of §GGreneclyf§!, home of changelings who so far have remained isolated from the outside world.\n\nThe collapse of the Empire brought many changes to the region. The main antagonist of the River Coalition is gone, and it must now redefine its identity. Some push for federalization while others want the Coalition to be a thing of the past. The Evi Valley broke free from the rule of the Empire, but suffer from instability themselves. If reforms are not made soon, the backwards griffon nations will collapse in on themselves, and a red star will rise from the ashes of old. The hillpony nations are less oppressive, but even then some ponies push for embracement of modernity. The wind of change is blowing in the east, but none can yet say what kind of change it is bringing."
 EAW_WS_Southern_Griffonia:0 "Southern Griffonia"
 EAW_WS_Southern_Griffonia_desc:0 "The southern coast of Griffonia is the warmest part of the continent, with the southermost areas even having humid jungles. Most of the region has arid plains and hills, with many islands and a few mountain ranges. It is populated primarily by griffons, yet there are also a sizeable number of ponies in the west and minotaurs in the east, living on numerous islands, the largest of which is §CKainourgio Spiti§!. The northern boundary of the region is made up by §CLake Rumare§! and the §gBlackhollow Mountains§!.\n\nThe ponies inhabit §GNew Mareland§!, an overseas dominion of §GEquestria§! established by ambitious colonists who bought the monster-infested land from the §RDuchy of Talouse§! centuries ago and cleared it for settlement. After the collapse of the §OGriffonian Empire§!, Talouse as well as other minor nations in the region joined the §YKarthinian Pact§!, led by the mighty §YKingdom of Wingbardy§!. §gFalcor§!, their old rival, did not join, and was then devastated in a war against Wingbardy where they lost their capital. The parishes of §RSicameon§! distrust the western and northern monarchies and are a beacon of liberty in the south, alongside the minotaurs of §CAsterion§!, their close allies. The minotaurs seek to liberate their kin from the oppressive rule of §gCyanolisia§! and its griffons.\n\nWingbardy is by far the strongest nation in the region and dominates its politics. However, they suffer from political and economic instability which may result in a radical change of government. Such a change will likely affect the entire region, not just the other Pact members. Meanwhile, New Mareland has so far remained loyal to Equestria, but the economic depression has made some ponies demand patriation and full independence. In the east, Asterion is preparing for war against Cyanolisia, and Sicameon is likely to support them. And while the nations of the south bicker, the Empire might rise in the north. Despite being so far away from Griffenheim, they may not escape the wrath of a resurgent Empire."
 EAW_WS_Western_Griffonia:0 "Western Griffonia"
 EAW_WS_Western_Griffonia_desc:0 "The Griffonian west has traditionally had closer ties to Equus due to its proximity. It has many natural harbours, and the interior is mostly hilly and thickly forested, so population and development are concentrated near the coast. Majority of the populace consists of griffons, though the southwest has a pony minority that has integrated into local culture. Off the coast, there are the islands of §LHaukland§! which lie near major trans-continental trade routes.\n\nFor most of its history, the west was dominated by the §RCrown of Aquileia§!, albeit it was conquered by the §OGriffonian Empire§! and, after its collapse and independence, suffered from a republican revolution, counter-revolution and subsequent decentralization. Now the Kingdom is divided into many parts, all nominally under the rule of the King. North of Aquileia is the §GPeriphery§!, the frontier region of the Kingdom now ruled by many small statelets. Northwest is the §gSkyfall Trade Federation§! once the most prosperous part of the Empire, and now an independent nation and a naval powerhouse. The islands of §LHaukland§! are also independent, ruled by deserters, pirates and other outlaws.\n\nUnlike in the Empire, Aquileia's revolutionaries did not flee, they hid. And now they are preparing to strike again and topple the monarchy for good. The King and his vassals are trying their best to crush the uprising before it even begins, but things are unlikely to go as planned. While Aquileia is busy with internal issues, the small nations of the periphery seek to establish themselves as proper states while clashing with each other. Eventually, Aquileia will go north and seek to reclaim their former territory, so they must prepare. Skyfall remains relatively stable, but their leader is very old and likely to pass away soon, forcing a change in power. The Hauklanders do as Hauklanders please, with no one to intervene in their affairs. However, heartland of the Griffonian Empire is close, and the old superpower may yet recover its strength. Should this happen, the Empire will likely turn its gaze to the rich lands of the west. Aquileia has long hated the Empire, but hate alone will do nothing if they do not prepare themselves for the storm."

 EAW_WS_Kiria_desc:0 "The homeland of the kirin species, the region of Eastern Zebrica collectively known as Kiria features many different landscapes, separated from the deer and llamas to the north by a tall and nearly impenetrable mountain range, and from the zebra nations to the west and south by a large river. In the north, the terrain is predominantly plains and hills, interspersed with significant swathes of dense forest. This region is controlled by the §YRealm of Kiria§!, once the largest and most powerful kirin state in the world. The area is home to two important river systems that make the area hospitable and suitable for a thriving agricultural society: the lifeblood of Kiria, the many tributaries of the magnificent §CGreat Mellifluve§! connect the majority of the region together and provide for fertile farmland between the river's many branches. The Great Mellifluve empties into the South Kirin Sea after passing by §GVerdant§!, the trade city that connects the region to the lesser kirin nations in the south. The imperial capital of §OVermilion§! sits along the easternmost branch of the Great Mellifluve, nestled safely in a fertile valley surrounded by mountains and hills that partially isolates and protects it from the surrounding countryside.\n\nTo the north, the §CCarmine River§! terminates at the port city of Fragrance, once the primary trading hub of the entire realm, connecting the merchants and traders of the §YRealm of Kiria§! to the rest of §YZebrica§!. Nowadays, the rivers are scarcely traveled, with most kirin returning to subsistence farming in the plains between the rivers, their once magnificent cities depopulated and declining, the infrastructure falling into disrepair. However, the region is rich in natural resources, land, and people, and the rivers make it a perfect candidate for industrialization, should §RThe Silence§! ever end.\n\nIn the south of Kiria, three autonomous states split off from the §YRealm of Kiria§! when the Silence began. The nations of §Y[NVA.GetName], [KXN.GetName], and [KHM.GetName]§! are all predominated by dense jungles and forests, with far fewer resources and a much smaller population than their northern brethren. Their lands are underdeveloped and untamed, and it will take great effort to modernize the lower kirin lands to the same level as the north once was. Of these three nations, §Y[NVA.GetName]§! fares the best, as the city of §GBlossom§! has remained a valuable trading port following the collapse of the trade routes in the north, and its lands are not as densely wooded as their two western neighbors. It will take effort and a strong leader, but perhaps there is a chance that these three southern kirin nations may one day unite and find themselves strong enough to withstand a resurgent northern Kiria."

The region is very hilly and has many islands, most notably §CHippogriffia§! and §GMacawia§!. In the south, closer to the vast Zebhara desert, the region becomes more arid and unhospitable, but also less hilly.\n\nThe nations of northern Zebrica have close ties to Equus and Griffonia and thus are among the more advanced nations on the continent. This is especially true for the island nations of Hippogriffia and Macawia, but also the secluded realm of §gChiropterra§! and the "republic" of §GTobuck§! as well. §LColthage§!, a venerable maritime republic, and §LWarzena§!, a monarchy ruled by a benevolent king, are still in the process of industrializing. §gQuaggatai§!, the realm of a Khan who took advantage of the chaos caused by the Storm King, and §OZarantia§!, a federation of desert nomads, are underdeveloped, agrarian nations.\n\nThe coastal regions were the final victim of §CStorm King's§! campaigns of pillaging and destruction, but Hippogriffia, Macawia and Chiropterra managed to survive unscathed. In fact, it was the hippogriffs who came out of hiding in §CSeaquestria§! and decisively defeated the Storm King. Macawia's powerful and modern fleet kept the islands safe, while the fortress-nation of Chiropterra was too heavily defended to be worth the effort. The rest of the region still has to recover from the devastation.\n\nChiropterra is the most likely to take advantage of the weakness and disarray. However, what they do depends entirely on what happens in §GEquestria§!. If their plans fail, then they are likely to take an aggressive stance and pose a major threat to the smaller nations. Colthage, despite suffering from internal instability, may choose to ally with them against Hippogriffia. As a bulwark of harmony, Hippogriffia will have to face them, but they might have to deal with internal threats first. Macawia will not intervene in this conflict and in general have little interest in mainland affairs."

It is because of these extremely tall Andelayan mountains that have prevented invasion by land, keeping Hindia safe and secluded from the rest of the continent. But it did not keep it safe from seaborne invaders.\n\nDue to this separation, much of the northeast is underdeveloped. The llama and alpacas of the highlands live in splendid isolation, ruled by an absolute and divine monarch, the Sapai Llama. The state controls almost everything, and wants to make sure nothing changes the status quo. On the slopes of the mountains, there is the small realm of §LStagpal§!, carved out by an ambitious deer conqueror, yet is populated mostly by llamas and alpacas. Down below, Hindia is divided between four nations: §CChital§! and §gSambar§!, whose Yarils are successors of Olenian vikings who conquered much of the subcontinent many centuries ago, as well as §RDoelhi§! and §GBarasingha§!, the principalities of the native deer. Off the shore, there is also the island realm of §gUusi Hirvimaa§!, the oldest viking realm that has Olenianized the most.\n\nThe region was spared from the §CStorm King's§! wrath mostly because of how far away from the yeti homeland it is, but the mountains also formed a great barrier against his airships. Yet even then, the region suffers from widespread poverty and illiteracy which hinders the nations. One economic boon of the region is its many rubber plantations, meaning a united Hindia can become one of the world's leading producers of rubber.\n\nA united Hindia, however, seems like a pipedream in 1007. Tensions between the two groups, the heirs of viking conquerors and the native princes, continue to grow, yet the Yarildoms and the principalities suffer from internal instability as well. A peaceful solution seems unlikely, so a region-wide conflict seems inevitable. Perhaps in the end, after the dust has settled, the deer of Hindia may have united under one banner."

The outskirts of this wasteland are more livable: The foothills of the §gAndelayas§! in the east, and the §CGreat Lakes§! in the west, fed by the mighty §CNeighle river§!.\n\nThe desert itself is desolate and is populated mostly by nomadic tribes. The northern part of Zebhara is nominally controlled by the §CAzir§! tribes, while the south is under the rule of the §RCentral Zebrican Empire§! and its mad yeti warlord. In the east, the §OFree Camel Tribes§! resist the rule of another yeti warlord, the self-proclaimed §gKing Boltrus§! of §gBoltria§! who seized Camelkand and subjugated most of camelkind. In the west, around the Great Lakes and along the Neighle river, exist many small zebra kingdoms and warlord states, formed after the fall of the §YMazwi Empire§!. The entire region is a powderkeg ready to explode, as most of the countries only recently declared independence, and some want to replace Mazwi as the new hegemon of the Great Lakes. The small nation of §gRe'em§!, ruled by a religious sect of horses, do not want to get directly involved in the upcoming conflict, but might support some of the warlords.\n\nCentral Zebrica was already poorer and less developed than the northern and western parts of the continent, but the §CStorm King§! made things much worse. The large and prosperous Mazwi Empire was sacked and destroyed, now only existing as a small rump state surrounded by furious former subjects. Further east, ambitious yeti generals established realms of their own after Storm King's death and now rule as cruel despots. Much of the wealth in the region was looted and carried elsewhere, yet the region cannot recover until numerous existing tensions are resolved.\n\nThe Great Lakes are likely to reunite, but which kingdom, tribe or warlord does so is difficult to predict. The Central Zebrican Empire will likely collapse as soon as the mad emperor dies, while the camels will fight for their freedom or die trying.

Many countries were completely destroyed and annexed directly into the Storm King's domain, while others were looted and ravaged. However, the yeti homeland itself has prospered, becoming rich from all the loot brought back by yeti warriors. But now as civil war tears the south apart, even that prosperity is threatened. Whoever wins and claims the mantle of Storm King will have to spend a long time to rebuild.\n\nWhile the yeti focus on their civil war, the Dervishes will intervene and try to reclaim their homeland. The Hayzeb Federation will primarily focus on the Great Lakes, but intervention is not out of the question for them either. Further east, the gargoyles and centaurs will deal with internal affairs, trying to keep their alliance and their countries together. But once the civil war ends, no one wants the brutal campaign of the Storm King to be repeated, and an anti-yeti alliance seems inevitable.

The southeastern peninsula is covered largely by thick jungles, and the air feels hot even when the nights are long in winter. There is no widely accepted explanation for this bizarre phenomenon, but there are rumours that a §YGolden Temple§! deep in the jungle is affecting the climate with magic. Rumours of this temple, valuable tropical plants and precious minerals in the hills have attracted the attention of §GFeathisian§! adventurers, who have established colonies to extract local wealth.\n\nThere are three such colonies: The §OSouth Zebrides§! in the many islands off the coast, the §YVrystaat§! on the hilly coast, and §LTalonsvaal§! in the arid northern mountains. While these states are mostly administered by griffons, their populace primarily consists of native zebras, while the Zebrides have a notable kirin minority as well. The natives of the region have nations of their own as well. In the northwest, there is the giraffe kingdom of §YTwizanyika§!, the belligerent §gZeblu Empire§! and §RRoam§!, whose zebra king has a lost Romauan legion as his retinue. In the southeastern jungles and forests and on the islands in the sea, there are many smaller tribes and kingdoms, the largest of which is §gZongo§!.\n\nThe Storm King largely left the southeast alone, and only small raids on the gold mines of Twizanyika were launched. The griffon colonists and their native neighbours were too militarized, while the rest of the southeast was too underdeveloped and poor to be worthwhile. The Golden Temple interested the Storm King, but he planned to search for it later after he had completed the rest of his conquests. Thankfully, he died before that.\n\nBecause none of the nations in the southeast have to be concerned with rebuilding, they can focus on dealing with their neighbours. Tensions have long been growing between the griffon colonists and natives, with Talonsvaal suffering a disastrous defeat against Roam. Zeblu is a rising power and will seek to become the hegemon of the region. Deep in the jungles, the tribes of the peninsula are stirring, while in the forests, the agrarian kingdoms seek to finally modernize and possibly wage war against their neighbours.

The northern half of this coast is arid, as the seas bring little rain and hot winds blow from the §YZebhara desert§!, while the south is more temperate. However, the eastern half of the Saddle Arabian peninsula is arid due to rain shadows from the mountains and because the rains of the Arabian Sea go east, not west. As majority of the northwest is dry, the population of cats, horses, ponies and donkeys is concentrated on the coast and along fertile rivers which flow from the mountains. The latter is especially true in §YMaregypt§!, as the grand §CNeighle river§! flows through it.\n\nSaddle Arabia is the largest nation in the region - or, it was, until civil war tore it asunder into five factions. The horses of Saddle Arabia were once hegemons of the entire west, but centuries of decadence have seen their empire crumble. Northeast of Saddle Arabia are §OAsstyria§! and §gAnseruk§!, nations of warlike donkeys, while cats inhabit the mountainous kingdom of Abyssinia. Maregypt is populated by ponies, cousins of Equestrians, as is the area of §GManedalusia§! which is partitioned between Abyssinia and Maregypt. South of the donkeys is the emirate of §RYemane§! which broke off from Saddle Arabia many years ago.\n\nHalf of the region avoided the §CStorm King's§! fury, while the other half was plundered by him. While Saddle Arabia was united, its modern and powerful army was a match to the Storm King's host, and they protected the donkeys which were still in their sphere of influence. Abyssinia, Maregypt and Yemane were not so lucky. The Storm King took everything what was worth taking from these countries and caused much havoc. Abyssinia especially suffered greatly, as they proudly resisted the Storm King to no avail.\n\nThe Storm King perished, and now would've been the perfect time for Saddle Arabia to reassert its dominance over the west. Alas, internal unrest reached a boiling point and the once powerful and wealthy nation is now tearing itself apart. The donkeys are now left without a protector, but are now also free to pursue their own foreign policy. Yemane, Abyssinia and Maregypt must focus on rebuilding what was destroyed, but all three of them have poor relations with their neighbours. The Griffonian Kingdom of Wingbardy has a small holding in Abyssinia and may seek to expand its southern domain as well.

The alliance between Maretonia and Aestlonia gives both a chance for survival as long as it lasts, while Riseia must unite one way or another, as being so divided makes them only a minor obstacle. At the very least, the smaller nations don't have to worry too much about modernization, being already so advanced, while Karkadannistan lags behind them.

Migrants were attracted by promises of free farmland, of jobs at the mines and fisheries, and more unofficially, of freedom from the Empire's direct rule. In fact, Nova Griffonia developed a reputation as a place were political dissidents and criminals were exiled to, and many migrants were initially convicts sentenced to forced labour in the mines.\n\nUnfortunately, despite greatly expanding in size over the years, Nova Griffonia always remained reliant on its colonial overlord.

But fate was cruel to §Ythe imperial dynasty§!, and their §YEmpire§! would not last.\n\nFirst founded by §YGrover I of Griffonstone§! in the year of 705, the Empire continued to prosper and grow under the tight but just talons of §Ythe Griffonstone dynasty§!. Their conquest of the Griffonian continent, spearheaded by the infamous §YWarrior-Emperor Grover II§!, was however halted by the ponies of the east, who formed the §RRiver Coalition§! to oppose and stop §Ythe Empire§! from threatening their sovereignty. With the end of expansionism, many peasants and previously conquered noble families had time to plot against §Ythe Emperor§! and his divine rule, beginning to see him as a foreign tyrant rather than a just ruler. Nevertheless §YEmperor Grover III§! managed to keep the Empire together and ensured the loyalty of most of his subject lords for many years. Those who continued to resist him soon vanished without a trace. He also established the §YImperial Army§! which soon became the largest military force in the world, and sought to form an Imperial identity to unite the many cultures of his vast Empire.\n\nHowever, during the reign of the next Emperor, §YGrover IV§!, cracks began to appear in the foundation of the Empire. While he was an expert administrator who was liked by the common griffons and began the modernisation of the Empire, the nobility despised him and grew increasingly disillusioned with Groverian rule. When he unexpectedly died, leaving an underaged and frail §YGrover V§! to succeed him, the nobles made their move and formed a §RRegency Council§! to govern the Empire. But the true §Rdecline of the Empire§! did not start until the Griffonstone cadet branch lost hold of the §YIdol of Boreas§!, an ancient relic that was a symbol of the power and legitimacy of the Imperial dynasty. It was stolen in 971 by a wicked cyclops named Arimaspi, who also slew King Guto VI, the supposed regent of Grover V. With this loss, it is said the gods abandoned the Empire.\n\nAfter the mysterious assassination of King Gumberto, §RThe Kingdom of Wingbardy§! was the first to secede in 972 under the leadership of newly crowned §RGaribald Talonuel III§!, together with their allies in the soon formed §YKarthinian Pact§!.

The Empire was still in a §YRegency§! and the power-hungry Imperial nobility prevented §YGrover V§! from ascending to the throne even after he became of age. This unjust regency came to an abrupt end in the winter of §R978§! when thousands of angry peasants and lowborn assaulted the Imperial Palace. The Emperor survived with the aid of §YArchon Eros VII§! and fled to the countryside, though many nobles were lynched. A §YGriffonian Republic§! was proclaimed which briefly replaced the Empire.

Things got worse as the climate turned colder and colder. The ponies left their homeland and many migrated south, to a new virgin land. Each pony tribe thought they were superior in a way and claimed the land for themselves, but only together could they prevail in the end. Equestrian folklore says that the three leaders of the tribes were locked away in a cave in the middle of a blizzard, and that the only reason they survived was cooperation and friendship. Henceforth, the tribes were united under a common banner and flag: §GEquestria§! was born.\n\nSoon after its foundation, §YPrincess Celestia§! and her younger sister §CPrincess Luna§! were called to lead the ponies of §GEquestria§!. The two Princesses are immortal Alicorns, sharing the abilities of each of the three races, and are powerful enough to raise and lower the Sun and Moon.

In desperation, Celestia had no choice but to banish her sister to the Moon for a §Ythousand years§!. A new age began, where §GEquestria§! had a single ruler who raised both the Sun and the Moon.\n\nThis age was a time of peace, growth and development. A treaty of friendship was signed with the Deer of §YOlenia§!, ending their coastal raids for good. Famed explorer Meanderly Polo crossed the ocean and travelled far to the east, where she discovered the eastern pony cousins of the §YRiverlands§!. Another explorer named Coltlumbus founded §YNew Mareland§! in southern Griffonia. Eventually, Jam Wutt would invent the steam engine, heralding the beginning of Equestria's industrialisation.

After mismanagement of weather followed by food shortages, the region of §YSeveryana§! revolted. Peace in Equestria had come to an end as the §RWinter Revolution§! erupted. Fearing full scale civil war, Celestia had no choice but to make peace, allowing the communist state to exist freely. This uprising was perhaps a sign of things to come.\n\nSeven years ago, at the dawn of a new millenium, Nightmare Moon returned, but six ponies discovered their fate as embodiments the §YElements of Harmony§! and used the magic of friendship to turn her back into Luna, making her leave her evil ways behind her and returning to rule by her sister's side.

They use these powers of deception to get close to victims and feed on their love, a resource which they ravenously seek, though they primarily subsist on flesh. Throughout most of their history they lived in underground §GHives§! and obey §GQueens§!, though they are not an actual hive-mind and possess a free will.\n\nFortunately for their neighbours, their aggression and relative geographical isolation caused them to spend more time fighting each other than outsiders, allowing deer and ponies to repel isolated incursions. Despite their insular nature, after Equestria's §Yindustrialization§! the Queens sent infiltrators to bring in technology and expertise. The hives began to modernize, with capitalists and military cartels rising in power to rival Queens.\n\nConflicts became frequent and in 953 an ambitious young §GQueen Chrysalis§! was lucky to rise to power in one of the strongest hives - Vesalipolis. At the time Vesalipolis was already in an alliance with a coastal hive Ditrysium.

Soryth voluntarily joined in 985 and other hives soon followed. For the first time in history, the hives were unified under a single government in 987, and in 988 Chrysalis was crowned §Gthe One Queen Of The Changeling Lands§!, with supreme authority over other queens.\n\nIn the years that followed, there were border conflicts with Olenia and a rise of communism, but during that time Chrysalis plotted a daring coup of Equestria to secure a near-endless supply of love and establish herself as master of all of Equus. During the royal wedding of §RShining Armour§! and §RPrincess Cadance§! in §YCanterlot§!, she managed to take the Princess' form and lower the defences from within, allowing a large swarm to attack the grand capital of §YEquestria§! and capture the leadership of the nation in one fell swoop. Only a last minute intervention of the Elements of Harmony and the overwhelming power of the engaged couple's love saved Equestria from conquest.\n\nFollowing the failed coup, the changelings began to question Chrysalis' authority, with harmonists under §RThorax§! and communists under §RGold Muffin§! rioting in the hives. Chrysalis reacted with extensive propaganda and by crushing the dissenters, forcing them into hiding or exile. Utterly humiliated, she swore revenge on Equestria. Subterfuge had failed her, so it was clear direct, brutal and extreme action would bring her and her subjects victory over the pacifist ponies.\n\nChrysalis began a vast program to modernize and expand the §GChangeling Army§!. An attache was sent to the §YGriffonian Empire§! that had great experience from conflict. With the vast army and rapid militarization, Chrysalis hopes to overcome her enemies with ease, so long as she can maintain her military advantage.\n\nHowever, the Changeling Lands lack many strategic resources vital for the war effort. An opportunity presents itself with a valid and easy target for conquest: the §CKingdom of Olenia§!. It is in political turmoil and is militarily weak.

The rugged mountains of Nimbusia were left for the pegasi guardians of the expedition, as they would be easily able to settle the area which was hard to traverse on hoof. Only later did the other tribes make their way into Nimbusia, but this initial divide has left its mark on Nimbusian society today. Initially many disconnected cities, or poleis, dotted the country, but the ponies from §GNimbusi§!, the largest polis, managed to subjugate the other cities with their §Ydisciplined pegasi army.§!

 EAW_WS_LNS_desc:0 "The territories which nowadays compose §Ythe County of Longsword§! have served as the natural barrier between Griffonia and the Riverlands for millennia, coveted by conquerors from East to West. Around one millennium before Luna’s banishment, the region began to see its first inhabitants, Riverpony tribes moving in from the east and settling in Longsword - the ancestors of the Longsword ponies of today.\n\nLongsword was shaped by its geographical position, its sparse population, and history. Having to defend themselves by incursions from all sides and protect their way of life meant that Longsword ponies became naturally more warlike and stubborn than the ponies of the Riverlands, whereas the forests and marshes of the region divided them into numerous disparate tribes. While they would occasionally unite against a common foe or join together in raids on foreign lands, they generally kept to themselves, holding onto a simple, tribal, communal way of life even when all of their neighbours moved on to feudal kingdoms.\n\nIn the following centuries, population pressures and ambitious tribal chiefs in Longsword would push the ponies to start mounting on raids to collect loot from surrounding kingdoms. Their river boats would reach as far as Herzland in the West and Rijekograd in the East. The Griffon estates were their primary target, however, and made Longsword ponies, and thus River ponies in general, into a bitter enemy of Herzland. To counter these raids, knightly orders tasked to defend the Griffon eastern frontier began to form - the Knightly Orders of §YHellquill§! (Order of Brothers of the Griffon House of Prelate Aloysious in Cloudbury) and §YRosewood§! (The Brotherhood of the Rosewood Spear) are the most famous ones. Even before the Crusades, these Orders waged a series of wars against the tribes in modern day Longsword and Hellquill, but they faced by bitter resistance from the tribes - they used the forests and marshes to their advantage in order to wittle down entire armies to nothing via attrition.\n\nIn §Y787 ALB§!, the Longswordian ponies would begin to unite under the leadership of an ambitious ruler, §YŽemaitukas§!. A worshipper of §YVarėnė, the Goddess of the Hunt§!, he subjugated the Longswordian tribes and founded the town of Varėna, which he envisioned as the religious center of Longsword. The “§YGrand Duchy of Longsword§!” he founded was short-lived, however - at §Y812 ALB§!, §YGrover II§! began the first of his many Crusades towards the East, and Longsword was his first target. It was torched, conquered and Žemaitukas fell against a Griffon blade. His achievements were larger than life, however - it is thanks to him that the concept of a united Longsword even exists.\n\nLongsword was granted to §Ythe House of Dusktalon§! after its conquest as reward for their faithful service in the Crusades, and became an Imperial March. As a condition, however, Western Longsword was granted the Rosewood Order, much like their brothers of the sword on the other side of the Griffking. Grover II’s solution was to require the monarchy to share its powers with the Order and its institutions, in the form of an advisory council. This compact stayed, and the county prospered. Though it was seen as a place for Griffon colonization, the Longswordian ponies received basic rights and most of them remained in their tribes as tenant farmers as long as they paid taxes. This colonization and pony presence would start to form a different culture as well, a so-called "§YOst-Griffonian§!" identity, which, while technically Griffonian, sees itself as something different regardless.\n\nHaving already grown distant from the Griffonian heartland in the centuries prior, Longsword severed the last of its ties with Griffenheim during the §YRepublican Revolution of 978§!, and abandoned its Imperial March status. Longsword's era of prosperity soon came to an end, however. The new Count of Longsword, §YPallas§!, took a step in the opposite direction. After having come into contact with the §YReformisten§!, or 'the Black Cloaks', a Griffon supremacist organization, Pallas was converted to their creed and became a mindless follower of their ideas.

In his mercy, §YEmperor Grover II§! granted the Bronze Mountains north of §YGriffenheim§! as our new homeland, allowing us to settle and prosper.\n\nSince then, the hounds of Bronzehill have been fiercely loyal to the Griffonian emperors, serving faithfully and diligently as guards and advisors to the imperial dynasty.\n\nThe mountains contain vast wealth and resources that have helped §YBronzehill§! and §YGriffenheim§! grow, however this has often come at the §Rexploitation§! of many hounds and the recent §Reconomic downturn§! after the disastrous §Rcollapse of the Empire§! has ushered in a new wave of §Rpoverty§! and economic stagnation. Efforts to recover have been hampered by the fact that §Rvery little§! of our nation's burgeoning industry is domestically owned, with large chunks being operated from firms based in §YGriffenheim§! and other imperial trade centres. In recent years this has led to a fierce debate of whether or not our assets are better managed by our griffon allies or if they should instead be §Ynationalized§! and put in the paws of §YBronzehill's§! inhabitants. In the meantime, the new §YGrover V Industrial Park§! in §YRavensburg§! is nearing completion, offering new jobs and opportunities to the hounds and griffons of Bronzehill.\n\nAs part of the §YImperial Heartlands§!, §YBronzehill§! is bordered by §Gfriendly regimes§! and united under §YImperial Protection§! As a §Yvassal state§!. With the §YImperial Capital§! is to the south, §YStrawberry Duchy§! and the §YSunstriker Clan§!, to the west and north, and the §YKnights of Hellquil§! to the East, the threat of the tyrannical §YDiamond Mountain§! and its allies in the §YRiver Coalition§! seems far away. This has both been a blessing and a curse. The years of stability and protection have resulted in §YBronzehill§! having §Rlittle military§! to speak of, with an ethos of §Rstern pacifism§! taken up by a populace which still remembers the lingering pains felt at the paw of §YDiamond Mountain§! soldiers during the great trek and before.\n\nThe main political issue facing §YBronzehill§! is that of the future imperial throne. It is no secret that §YGrover V's§! health is §Rbeginning to falter§!, and in the event of his premature death, their would-be conflict over the regency of his son, the future §YGrover VI§!. As to who the regent will be, only time will tell, and with the §Rdeep divisions growing§! between the Griffonian nobility and the church, the regent choice will be unlikely to please everyone. Either way, the death of an Emperor is always a §Rtraumatic event§! for the dogs of Bronzehill and will cause §Rsevere distress§! among its citizens.\n\n§YCount Ignatius Bronzetail§! has ruled Bronzehill since the death of his father in 1005. He is popular and well liked, however he has yet to have been tested like his father was in the Empire's collapse and the Republican Uprising of 978.

The count's son, §YBarnaby§!, has become fascinated with the harmonists and sees Bronzehill's future lying in their influence.\n\nBeyond the walls of the council, the §YCommunist Party of Bronzehill§! is a growing thorn in the count's side. The Communists are growing in popularity among the lower classes with their promises of better working conditions, removal of social inequality, societal reforms, and loyalty to the Emperor. But the communists themselves are not united, with §Rvarious factions vying for control§! In their loose coalition. Meanwhile, the §YKnights of the Bronze Cross§! And the §YPrelate of Ravensburg§! remain popular among the griffons living in Bronzehill, even if their loyalties seem to lie more towards the church then the Emperor.\n\nWith uncertainty on the horizon, only time will tell what the future of Bronzehill will hold."

Yet it cannot even be compared to modern democracies, for it is a truly unique and exceptional §YRepublic of Peasants.§! Which is not necessarily a compliment...\n\nThe infamous Duke of Greifenheim, §RErebus Blacktalon§!, had always been a thorn on the side of §YEmperor Grover I§!. So when the local peasants revolted and overthrew him in 720, the Emperor, instead of crushing the dissidents, gave them an offer: The commoners would be allowed to form their own, independent government and in return swear eternal loyalty to the Emperor who would protect them. The offer was accepted and §YGreifenmarschen§! was born. The peasants wanted to prevent the rise of another despotic ruler and thus created an elaborate system of direct democracy, with common referendums on most matters of state, an advisory Council lead by a §YStatthalter§! and elections held every three months. This has allowed every single citizen in Greifenmarschen to participate in politics regardless of status or ideology, but in turn has made the Republic extremely slow to change or reform. For centuries, there was no need for such things as the Emperor ensured their safety.\n\nSadly, the Empire was not meant to last.\n\nIn the tumultuous years preceding and following the §Rrevolution of 978§!, the griffons of Greifenmarschen had to rely on themselves for defence. The §YBauernmiliz§!, a brave citizen militia, ensured the Peasant Republic prevailed. Afterwards more radical ideologies such as §RCommunism§! and §CNationalism§! gained popularity, yet had little impact on stability thanks to Greifenmarschen's political structure. To this day no one dares to publicly propose abandoning democracy, though some wish for it to change. Change, however, doesn't happen easily in Greifenmarschen.\n\nNow peace once more reigns in Herzland, it seems, and most Greifenmarsians wish to continue their daily lives like before. But some fear that this is merely the calm before the storm, and the country's reliance on agriculture and unprofessional militia will be their doom.\n\nWill the venerable Republic survive the new century?

Few places could claim to be more wretched hives of scum and villainy than the Hauklandish isles. When ponies began migrating in Griffonia, the isles became a crossroad from which they could sail to wherever on the continent. It was at that time that the place began to be known as "the §YCrossroad§!". That is until the newly formed §YGriffonian Empire§! finally turned its eyes on the isles. Faced with the full might of an Empire, the Hauklandish milicias quickly scattered, leaving Haukland to become part of the griffon hegemon.\n\nUnder the imperial yoke, §YHaukland§! saw its role as an invasion springboard maintained but this time, it was turned towards Equus with all of Grover's imperial might. From there, the §YGriffonian Empire§! conquered and settled §YNova Griffonia§!. However, as naval technology marched on, the isles were reduced to a simple stop in the transcontinental griffonian trade. The settlers who tamed the isles left, seeking more opportunities in the new frontier or back home. And so, §YHaukland§! declined and became a simple fishing province.\n\nWhen the Idol of Boreas was stolen in 971, little changed in Haukland. The locals only noticed that fewer ships seemed to travel to Weter and some officers quarrelling in the Haukhamn barracks. But on the continent, a griffon was getting ready to change Haukland forever.\n\n§YHermann Meyer§!, a young officer in the Imperial Airforce, went from being an eccentric but ignored aviation proponent to the new leader of the §YRepublican Airforce§!. The griff was admired by his peers and beloved by the pilots and cadets of the Griffonian Air Academy. However, he was no idealist and had little appetite for Kemerskai's dreams of democracy. And so, when the counter-revolution approached Griffenheim, Meyer simply gathered his pilots and announced to them that they wouldn't sacrifice themselves in the defense of a fool's dream. Instead, they would fly away and carve their own place in history. The pilots agreed to follow him. And so, §GMeyer's Flying Aces§! as they would be later known packed up, hopped in their planes and took off. They ignored all warnings, both from the imperial loyalists or the republicans, stopping only to give air support to a republican officer who simply asked for a favor. Under Meyer's leadership, they flew to the only place they were sure no griffs would come for them : §YHaukland§!. This event became infamous as the §RWild Ride§!.\n\nWhen the Flying Aces arrived in Haukland, they found only traces of the original garrison. Most had deserted their posts to join one of the factions on the continents or simply try their luck. The rest either joined or fled. Meyer immediately declared independence from the §YGriffonian Empire§! and proclaimed himself the new Graf of Haukland. The overall reaction then was a global shrug. Many thought the Empire would come and claim its province back. It never did.\n\nOver the next decades, Haukland reclaimed its place as a home for raiders and pirates. Despite the modernization of ships worldwide, the Hauklandish gained a significant edge on even the best convoys : air support. And so, Meyer's flying aces and pirates became rich. With no navies willing to bring war to them, Meyer began to simply impose a toll on anyone trying to cross the seas around his domain.\n\nBut what now?

The sheer size of the empire and the proximity to Griffenheim allowed Yale to specialise on providing §Guniversity education§! to the imperial elite. §GYale University§!, in the capital of the duchy, was founded in 765 ALB, with other Yalish cities soon following with their own centres of learning.\n\nOver the next century, these universities would attract students from all over the continent, growing in prestige and wealth within the duchy while technology advanced into the industrial age. However, the advent of industrialism saw the landowning nobility grow ever poorer, while the universities and cities blossomed. Yale itself lost more prominence in the place of Greenback, the industrial heart of the duchy.\n\nIn the fateful year of 878, the ducal family was nearing bankruptcy and they were forced to sell of their ducal title to Yale University itself, letting the prestigious institution rule the country in their stead. As to not provoke the wrath of Griffenheim, Yale kept the nobility and the duchy alive in name, under the first Rector Magnificus of the country, §GBorean Wiedergreiff§!, polymath, architect and scholar. The eccentric and charismatic father of modern Yale had the foresight and imagination to dream up inventions well ahead of his time, some which have still §Ynot been made into a reality§!. He moved the capital from Yale to §GGreenback§!, a central location, finishing a shift in the centre of power that had started at the beginning of the 9th century.\n\nWhen §Rthe republican revolution§! swept through the Imperial Heartlands in 978, Yale saw the majority of the nobility flee the country and the universities took advantage of this by formalising their power in the formation of §Gthe Yale Rectorate§!, vowing to strive for more autonomy from Griffenheim. Although the universities had trained many republicans, the Rectorate was on the fence between supporting either side, only throwing their weight behind the Emperor when his victory was already certain.\n\nIn 1007 ALB, university rule has §Ystagnated§!, and the citizens of Yale feel alienated from the government. The Empire is crumbling, but only the allegiance to the Emperor and the perceived competence of the government is keeping the growing and impoverished lower class in check. If the Yale Rectorate wants to stay in power when the empire's influence retreats from the land and continue the scientific vision of Borean Wiedergreiff, it will have to win the §Rhearts of the people§!.\n\n§YRector Magnificus Mikusian§!, the leader of the Council of Rectors, might soon be forced to make compromises with the more radical factions in the universities. He would like to pursue welfare through scientific innovation, caring for the common griffon through optimisation of the government's efficiency. If he can accomplish this, perhaps Yale can remain a beacon of higher learning for all of Griffonia.\n\nOthers seek to use science to advance their own ideologies. §gGamia University§! sees ethics as hurting the pure pursuit of knowledge and seeks to undermine the ethical standards of research that keep science pure. For this they have allied with §CBruma University§!, which has strong backing from the Triarchy. The professors there believe that only religion can help restore the social bonds between the griffons and their rulers. In §RCyrusval§!, however, they believe that these very bonds between authority and the proletariat cause the suffering in Yale. In the red halls of its university, the professors teach that the march of history will only be complete when every unjust hierarchy is abolished.\n\nWith the §YEmperor's worsening condition§!, decisive action might have to be taken soon.

For hundreds if not thousands of years, the plains of Verenia, the region where our noble house is currently located, were but mere extensions of various other states. No great lords and realms were born in these wild grasslands, or at least knowledge of such empires was lost after §YAquilean Kingdom§! extended it's borders east.\n\nHowever Aquilean dominance over these plains wasn't eternal and unquestionable. Many others desired these lush grasslands, now filled with rich towns and cities, most notably §Yhouse Eyrie§! of §YDuchy of Verenia§!. Of course while the so proclaimed §Y"Lords of Sun and Moon"§! were powerful, their might was nothing compared to the one of §YDiscrets§!. Such status quo would be changed with the rise of the champion of Boreas - §YGrover I of Griffonstone§!. The ambitious king desired to unite all of griffonkind under his banner and thus set out on a great campaign of conquest and subjugation. \n\nNot all realms chose to resist Grover however, some joined him willingly. One of such states was Verenia under §Yduchess Adelina§!, who was one of the first to bend the knee to the future Emperor. Due to this, during the war against Aquilea, the armies bearing the banner of sun and moon fought under the banner of the Idol of Boreas. The forces of Verenia fought bravely and valiantly and thus Grover I saw it fit to reward Adelina with a §Gtruly generous gift§! - half of the Verenian region, nearly increasing the size of the Duchy three times. \n\nThis realm remained relatively rich and prosperous during the Imperial period, even if certain problems - such as the §Rinability to advance and modernize§! at same pace as certain other regions and the ever growing animosity between the nobility which was split between Aquileans and Herzlanders. Even the attempt of eliminating such problems by spreading members of Eyrie across the realm only lessened the problems and in some cases even worsened them, as part of the royal family assimilated into the regions assigned to govern, creating the cadet branch of §YErie§!. \n\nThe culmination of this slow decline would come after the §RGriffonian revolutions§! and the counter revolutions that followed. Verenia was devastated by not only the §Rrepublicans of the Heartlands§!, but also by the surge of §RAquilean revolutionaries§!. This completely devastated the realm as many of it's nobles and even members of house Eyrie and the cadet branch Erie were executed, leaving an old, now childless monarch on the throne and 2 potential successors with an equally valid claim - §YIovinus Eyrie§! and §YDuke Vincent Erie§!. Successors, who on the death of the duke, were unwilling to bend and admit the other to be superior and decided that blades were better at deciding such matters than words, §Rdeclared war on each other, splitting the state into two§!. \n\nAt first it seemed that Vincent would win, with the larger part of the former realm behind him, however due to actions of §YLady Katrina Rivertail§!, this didn't happen. Being the aunt of both pretenders to the throne and unwilling to participate in a conflict between her dear nephews, she broke off her own would be state, proclaiming herself the §Ymatriarch§! of the newly formed §YHouse Avian§!.\n\nHowever such a choice had quite the negative result. With Rivertail domains leaving House Erie, depriving them of substantial amount of troops and industry, the front of the kinslaying war stagnated, §Rresulting in over a decade of bloody warfare§!. Not to mention that such swift breaking up of the Duchy of Verenia resulted in the newly created House Avian facing countless problems themselves - most notable of which is the ever growing §Rcultural and linguistic divide§! and antagonism between the non-noble population. Of course this isn't even mentioning the perilous position of existing between Heartlands and Aquilea.\n\nWill House Avian manage to rise from the shackles of feudalism and linguistic divide and survive through the upcoming storms?

The ancient semi-feudal system is creaking and groaning, as the peasants gradually become less satisfied with being tied down to their lords' land, and ethnic divisions split the nation. Most pressingly, the Host's treasury is §Rrunning dry.§! This is doubly serious because of the presence of §RCommunist Revolutionaries§!, inspired and funded by the revolutionaries in Prywhen. Though they are not yet organised enough to overthrow the Hetmanate, they have many supporters throughout the countryside, and even among the army. If §Ythe upcoming raids for plunder were to fail§!, then dissent within the nation would likely rise high enough for them to sieze power.\n\nEven if nothing of the sort happens, Bulba is old, and unlikely to live for much longer.

 EAW_WS_SIC_desc:0 "Nestled away behind the tall Arahno Mountains on the warm and fertile Makomo Peninsula, lies the free and prosperous nation of §YSicameon.§! The griffons of this §Yvenerable republic§!, almost as old as the Empire itself and named for the sea goddess Sycaecia, have long stood staunchly against the forces of §Rfeudalism and monarchism.§! This federation of parishes is made up of skilled craftspeople, humble but productive farmers, shrewd traders, and dauntless seafarers, who all are united in jealously guarding their liberties and prosperity it brings them. While the §YGriffonian Republic§! may have the aspirations of a continental republic, let it be known that §YFederated Parishes of Sicameon§! was the §Yherald of Griffonian democracy.§!\n\nThe federation was formed in 773, when the aging §YEmperor Grover I§! sent a small army to test the defences of Sicameon. The parishes united under one banner to repel the invader and formed a decentralized nation so they could better face future threats from the north. But when §RGrover II§! attacked in 799 with the full might of the §YImperial Army§!, there was little they could do. The federation was dismantled and a §RGrand Duchy§! founded in its place. However, resistance continued and never ceased. When Grover II died in 854, a §Rlarge uprising§! motivated Grover III grant them autonomy and abolish the Grand Duchy. The §GFederal Charter§! of 773 is restored, albeit with many changes that expand emergency powers and make Sicameon a far more militant nation. When the wicked Empire eventually §Gcollapsed§!, Sicameon aided §Gminotaur revolutionaries§! in Asterion who formed a republic.\n\nHowever, with the turn of the new millennium, the griffons of Sicameon are acutely aware of the chaos in §RWingbardy and Prywhen§! and the threats they may pose, but the Sicameonese constitution renders the national government and military §Rextremely limited in its capabilities§!. To continue safeguarding the freedoms and liberties of the Sicameonse griffons, they must put faith in a greater unity and a stronger government, and then decide how best to use this new tool. Will they continue the age-old tradition of §Yfortification and repulsion§!, will they embrace the §Ywarcries of Sicameon's radicals and seek revenge§! on their neighbors... or will they §Ydiscover a new path?§! Whether with righteous purpose or terrible intent, a powerful apparatus of government can tear even the most united nation apart.\n\nThen, in the shadows of Sicameon's ports, lies another threat. Being a wealthy trading nation brings with it §Rthieves and criminal riffraff.§! Sicameon has a §Ggreat naval tradition§! in warding off these pirates, and thus is staunchly opposed to slavers and bandits of all kinds... §Rthe bandits to the north, the Zebran slavers and the pirates to the south.§! But even the most virtuous are susceptible to corruption in the face of desperation and chaos, especially as the homegrown §YFreeholder Corsairs§! rise among the fear and tension.\n\nAnd yet, despite the discord far afield and within, Sicameon has ample chance to stand high and mighty. It lacks the economic disaster, the famine, and the brain drain of its unfortunate neighbors. In this new modern era, Sicameon simply must seize its true power before it is too late."

But he had no fleet with which to invade their islands, so a peace treaty was signed. The pathetic cows lost all their mainland holdings which became a part of the §YEmpire§!.\n\nSoon after the §CSumpfkiel dynasty§! was established to rule the newly founded County, while the state now known as Salmarkt was ceded to the §YPrincipality of Brodfeld§!. The griffon nobles were given the duties of keeping the minotaur populace in check, ensuring loyalty of the Kingdom of Asterion which had been subjugated by §REmperor Grover II§! and maintaining order in the region in the name of the Emperor. During the reign of §YEmperor Grover III§!, they received an additional task: The griffonisation of the region. Thousands of migrants would arrive from all across the Empire, primarily from Herzland, minotaurs were stripped of their rights and old monuments were torn down to make way for new ones.

Many of them were related to the §YGryphian cossacks§! from the north and like them, they shared a love of freedom and independence. Indeed, the land they settled soon became a haven of freedom, attracting many merchants and migrants from abroad. There was no strict rule of law, no central authority, no order. To some it was criminal chaos, to others, liberty in its purest form.\n\nThe §RGriffonian Empire§! eventually put an end to this.\n\n§YEmperor Grover I§! had marched across the Creeper Mountains in 747 and subjugated the many principalities west of the §YEvi river§!, but it did not take long before the east joined his vast dominion as well. The northern Gryphian cossacks became an Imperial march while Gryphussian towns and merchant cities soon realized most of their former trade partners were now part of the Empire. Nevertheless the small city-states retained their independence, too busy with mutual bickering to join together. This proved to be perilous when §REmperor Grover II§! began his crusades in the Riverlands in 810. He had crushed Sicameon and subjugated Asterion in the west, meaning Gryphus found itself surrounded, its sea routes controlled by the mighty §YImperial Navy§!. When Grover II arrived, one by one the city-states kneeled before their new overlord, too divided to resist. They were forced to supply his large armies as they campaigned in the eastern land of the ponies. Later the §RKnightly Order of Opinicus§! was established in their lands by Grover II to guard the southern border of the Empire.\n\nAfter Grover II perished in battle, §YGrover III§! maintained peace within his realm. This allowed Gryphus to prosper once again as they could now trade freely within the Empire. During this time the Sicameonese §YSouthern Continent Company§! received a charter from the Emperor and gained exclusive rights to commerce in the southern seas and became very influential within Gryphus. More migrants arrived from Sicameon, further increasing the §Rcultural divide§! within the nation.\n\nDuring the Empire's collapse in 978 the towns were left without a master and seized the opportunity to regain their long lost liberty. However, this time the city-states would unite under one banner and form a single nation: Modern Gryphus, lead by an elected §YCouncil§!, was born. But the aftermath of the Empire's rule remains. Zealous knights of §ROpinicus§! wish to go on the offensive against pony heathens and the §RTrade Company§! continues to accrue more power and wealth.

 EAW_WS_MIT_desc:0 "1470 years ago a rag tag fleet of seven ships traveled across the sea from the land of Knosos (now known as §YNimbusia§!), led by a minotaur named §CAster§!. The minotaurs were born from an unholy union between a bovine queen and a strange creature sent by the gods, or so the legend goes. While their origins are cloaked in myth and legend though, their reasons for leaving their home were clear: oppression by a §Rforeign pony monarchy§! that had seized control of their lands and did not care about their plight. Upon arriving in the §CAsterion Archipelago§! the ships of the fleet spread out to found twenty-one colonies, four of which were located on the mainland. Those twenty-one colonies formed themselves into a §Cconfederation§! to democratically settle any internal and external disputes. This lasted for hundreds of years until a crisis came about that allowed an ambitious politician to declare himself §Rking§!. The new kingdom would end up lasting for longer than the democracy that preceded it, but it was always a hollow existence. Non-compliance was commonplace, and both in secret and abroad the Asterionese would continue to advocate for freeing the homeland of tyranny. This would all come to an end when the Griffonian Empire attacked.\n\nWhen §YEmperor Grover I§! invaded the eastern griffon principalities in 747, he famously marched across the §GCreeper Mountains§! and caught them by surprise, for they had expected him to come from the north or the south. The principalities were soon subjugated, but the Kingdom of Asterion protested. The mountains had belonged to them and the Emperor refused to cede them back. When he heard the minotaurs' demands, his response was harsh: he §Rcrushed§! the Asterionese army and §Rannexed the mainland states§!, which later became the §RCounty of Cyanolisia§!. However, he could not invade Asterion itself without a fleet, so peace was settled. The monarchy had been decisively weakened, so when §REmperor Grover II§! came in 799 to secure supply lines for his crusade against the eastern ponies and to teach the south a lesson in humility, Asterion did little to resist. §YThe Imperial Navy§! blockaded the archipelago, a massive army landed and the King §Rsurrendered§! after a single engagement.\n\nFrom that time on a darkness would settle across the land as the native population was forced to abide by §RImperial rule§!. Democracy was forbidden, minotaurs were rendered second class citizens in their own land, and native religions such as Actualism were suppressed in favor of the Imperial pantheon. When the Empire fell into §Grevolution§! Asterionese forces organized to overthrow the puppet government in what became known as the §CRestoration War§!, with generous support from §GSicameon§!. They were successful in liberating the archipelago, and the government that emerged was a representative democracy based around the rule of law, rather than the rule of monarchs. The revolution was unable to spread to the mainland, however, and this soon formed the basis of public consciousness. The next twenty-eight years were marked extensive planning for a §Gcontinental invasion§! and massive build up of the navy and army. The good times would not last however, and indeed by the time 1007 of the Equestrian calendar rolled around political deadlock had set in. The nation of Asterion now finds itself divided, with a §Rcoalition of nationalists and communists§! gaining popularity by advocating radical policies that change the status quo. Outsiders think this will lead to a civil war, but they miss a key point of the Asterionese national spirit: They are so fearful of monarchies that civil war is off the table for every minotaur in the nation for fear that as soon as they start shooting at each other foreigners will attack and enslave them once again. Two phrases unite the nation: §C"We shall reclaim the mainland!"§! and §R"Death to imperialists!"§!"

Kiria was a land ravaged by war, famine, and chaos, and it would not be until a few centuries later that the realm would be united under the §OWay of Fire§!.\n\nThe kirin mystics trekked into the wilderness, refugees from wartorn Kiria, heading for the mountain ranges that rimmed the northern borders of the Kirin Realm. Marching into the Peaks of Peril to traipse along the spines of Kiria's northern mountains, the kirin mystics would eventually emerge into the land that would come to be known as §YTaungpau§!. To these battered and weary kirin, at the end of a long and arduous march into exile, the lush valleys and verdant plains of Taungpau would have seemed like paradise, free from the war and destruction of their erstwhile homeland.\n\nThese first kirin settlers in Taungpau would soon be joined by more of their brethren, similarly displaced by conflict and strife. As their numbers grew, friction arose between them and Taungpau's indigenous llama population — the latter of whom had long been tolerant of the former's presence within their lands, but now feared the influence of these kirin interlopers on their way of life. The vision of Taungpau as an idyllic land of tranquillity and abundance seemed to be under threat, were it not for the intervention of §CThiri Tranquil Breeze§! —  founder-mother of the §CCanon of the Eternal Kindling§!.\n\nTo this day, it is unclear whether Thiri Tranquil Breeze was a llama or a kirin; the paucity of information about her true identity suggests concerted efforts to expunge the race of the §Yfounder-mother§! from historical records, and it is impossible to discern whether it was her Taungpauan or Kirin name that she had been born with, and which she had later adopted. In the Fourth Century, she had founded the §CCanon of the Eternal Kindling§!, central to which is the ideal of §Yperpetual equilibrium§!, and the achievement and maintenance thereof. Taungpau, a land of two peoples, proved to be fertile ground for this credo — that peace and harmony were the fruits of balance and symmetry. The Canon spread throughout both the llama and kirin populaces, and Taungpau became a nation holding in common a shared faith.\n\nUnder the guidance of the Canon, stability prevailed in Taungpau. Protected by the mountains that ring its borders and insulated from the changes that occured beyond, the land flourished under a period of peace and agrarian prosperity, albeit one without much technological progress. The §YTemporal Conclave§!, a forum of the Canon's most senior theologists and philosophers, was formed in 852 as a concession to modernity's encroachment on Taungpau, with a growing population, gradual technological advancement, and entailingly, the increasing complexity of life, all of which necessitated some form of central government. The de-facto capital of the §YEternal Mandate§!, as Taungpau would come to be known, the Temporal Conclave, housed on a small fleet of riverboats, travels up and down the banks of the §YSahajart River§! with a nomadic host of land-based camp followers in tow: a wandering capital straddling both land and water, its location in a state of constant flux so that the Conclave — Taungpau's locus of political power — could never become stagnant and thus disrupt the balance of power in the land.\n\nOf little geopolitical value, Taungpau may well endure the looming turmoil of the new millenium with its bucolic way of life intact, as long as the Eternal Mandate continues to find success in its perpetual tug-of-war against the twin forces of §Rprogress§! and §Rentropy§!, the manifestations of which, in the form of industrialisation, war, and crisis, must be overcome as they arise."

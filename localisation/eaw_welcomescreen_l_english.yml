 EAW_WS_TAB_3_TXT:0 "\n\n£eaw_text  §YEquestria at War§! incorporates a fork of §YExpanded Technology + Industry + Equipment§! by §YGreatexperiment§! (used with permission), that has been edited and streamlined to fit our design goals better. This allows for a longer game with more technologies to research.\n\nEaW introduces §YMagical Equipment§! and a new resource - £resources_strip|7  §YCrystals§! - used to produce it. §YMagical Equipment§! provides a more resource, IC-intensive, less reliable, but more powerful alternative to regular §YInfantry Equipment§!.\n\n§YPre-Industrial Infantry Equipment§! and §YArtillery§! have been added, to represent the weapons used by nations that have not yet industrialized.\n\nFurthermore, EaW introduced the §YRaces§! system. Each country has one of five races - §Ypony§!, §Ychangeling§!, §Ygriffon§!, §Ydeer§! and §YUnspecified§! (with more races planned). Each race has its own unique racial tech tree folder, and in some cases racial unique units. Races cannot be changed during the game (exception being an option for the §YChangeling-Olenian Commonwealth§!).\n\n\n\nIn order to better represent the differences in industrial/societal and research development of nations in Equestria at War, §YDevelopment§! and §YScientific Development§! idea categories have been implemented.\n\n§YDevelopment§! represents the general state of industrialization and advancement of economy and society. Low levels of §YDevelopment§! impose §RIndustry§!, §RResearch§! and §RPolitical§! maluses. §YDevelopment§! can be improved by §YNational Focuses§! or §YDecisions§!, depending on the country.\n\n§YScientific Development§! represents the level of education and research capabilities of the nation. Low levels of §YScientific Development§! impose §RResearch§! maluses. §YScientific Development§! can be improved by §YNational Focuses§! or §YDecisions§!, depending on the country. For §Ygriffon§! countries, owning major centers of learning in Griffonia can be used to improve §YScientific Development§! as well.\n\n\n\nThe potential of nuclear warfare and the horror of unleashing such terrible weapons is not quite seen in Vanilla. In order to rectify this, EaW introduces the following changes:\n- Nuclear attacks will now reduce the population of a hit §Ystate§!, using believable casualty numbers depending on state population and development (using multiple nuclear bombs on a state in short succession will not reduce population as drastically).\n- A §Ystate§! hit by a nuclear attack will receive the §YFallout§! state modifier, reducing state factories, supplies, division organization and increasing division attrition. The modifier will last for a §Yyear§!. Subsequent nuclear attacks will not stack the modifier, but will reset the one year timer.\n- Production of §Ynuclear bombs§! requires a supply of £resources_strip|7  §YCrystals§!. If none are available, no new §Ynuclear bombs§! will be produced. Each §YNuclear Reactor§! consumes 12 £resources_strip|7  §YCrystals§!.\n\n\n\nAfter a country has been defeated in a war, and a peace conference has ended, the victors will have a chance to receive §Yone-time 15% research speed bonuses§! to §Ytechnologies§! that the loser had researched, and the victor has not.\n\nThe chance to receive the bonus is random, and calculated per technology. The more of loser's §YIndustry§! that has been taken over by the victor (either by puppeting or annexation), the higher the chance to receive a bonus, which means that not every victor will have an equal chance. The level of §YDevelopment§! of the victor is also a factor - the worse the Development, the smaller the chance.\n\n\n\n£eaw_text  §YEquestria at War§! includes a small number of new musical tracks. In order to allow the players to choose what kind of music they prefer, we have implemented a button in the §Ymusic player window§! (accessed by clicking the §Ynote symbol§! below §Ytime speed controls§!, and then the §Yleftmost button§!) allowing to choose between §Yboth Vanilla and EaW music§!, §Yonly Vanilla music§! and §Yonly EaW music§!.\n\nThe optional, but recommended £eaw_text  §YEquestria at War Music Mod§! supports this feature as well.\n\n\n\nAn effort was made to improve the AI. While it is by no means perfect, and most of the real improvements can only be implemented by Paradox, we have done our best to tweak AI's behaviors, and improve AI's handling of Division Templates. AI will use all of the added units and technologies. AI will intelligently choose Doctrines based on the bonuses they recieve in their Focus Tree. AI will use dynamic strategies to respond to events and changes on the world stage. Peace Conference AI has been improved, though it is not perfect."

 # Regions
 EAW_WS_Northern_Equestria:0 "Northern Equestria"
 EAW_WS_Northern_Equestria_desc:0 "The Northern parts of the Equestrian continent are dominated by cold temperatures and mountainous terrain. Because of this, the region suffers from a debilitating lack of §YInfrastructure§!, making logistics a challenging task.\n\nThe countries in the North of Equestria are notably a lot weaker than their neighbours to the South. As such, northern nations require a substantial amount of buildup and time to launch a successful attack on the south.\n\nPolitically and economically, §YNova Griffonia§! starts out as the strongest nation in the North, though it is not quite a regional hegemon, and can be overpowered by other nations, depending on the choices made during the game.\n\nThe North has to worry most about their neighbours to the south, mainly §YStalliongrad§!, the §YChangelings§! and §YEquestria§!. Seeing as how the North lacks infrastructure and industrial capacity in comparison to the southern nations, they are very vulnerable to attacks from their more powerful neighbours. That said, the mountainous and harsh terrain of the North does favor the defender.\n\nThe North offers a region with challenging terrain and tough starting conditions, and one must bide their time and exploit their neighbours to make further expansion outside the region possible."
 EAW_WS_Southern_Equestria:0 "Equestria"
 EAW_WS_Southern_Equestria_desc:0 "Western and Central Equestria feature a variety of different landscapes, ranging from mountain chains and jungles to snowy forests and flat grassland. Due to the varying sorts of terrain, the level of §YInfrastructure§! can vary a lot between different states. This region also features a long coastline, most of which is controlled by §YEquestria§! at the start of the game.\n\nMost southern nations start the game with a relatively large amount of divisions and/or industry. This makes them big threats to outsiders, though the political landscape of most countries prevents them from breaching out into different regions of the world for a long time.\n\nPolitically, this region is largely dominated by §YEquestria§!, which has the possibility of exerting further influence if they so choose. §YEquestria§! starts out as a disarmed nation, unlike their main rival and opponent, §YThe Changeling Lands§!. They, unlike their Harmonic neighbour, start out with a bigger and more capable army, and aren't as peace-loving either. It is noteworthy that this region usually grows with tension, until §YThe Changelings§! declare war on their rival, as part of §Ythe Great War§!.\n\nThe usual strategy of most countries in this region revolves around a massive industrial and military buildup during the early game, resulting in a great, region-wide war during the midgame, and finally ending in the victory of one side, who will then be in a prime position for global supremacy. Generally speaking, if one wishes to compete in this struggle for power, they would need to be on the winning side during §Ythe Great War§!.\n\nEquestria features a large variety of terrain with varying levels of §YInfrastructure§!, and features some of the most powerful nations in the world. The gameplay is largely based around the central conflict between §YEquestria§! and §YThe Changeling Lands§!, which most of this region will be involved in."
 EAW_WS_Northern_Griffonia:0 "Northern Griffonia"
 EAW_WS_Northern_Griffonia_desc:0 "Northern Griffonia is a mixture of flatland and mountains, with a very low level of §YInfrastructure§! and industrial development. The terrain, low §YInfrastructure§! and harsh weather can make it a challenge to supply your troops efficiently.\n\nThe North of Griffonia features nations with a generally low level of industrial capacity and development. As such, they have a very hard time expanding beyond the borders of their own region, and require a lot of time to build up and eat up other, smaller nations around them. Nations to the East or South could, if they so wished, easily overpower any of the northern nations through industrial and military might, something that northern nations have a hard time catching up on.\n\nThe strongest nation in northern Griffonia is §YThe Griffonian Republic§!, which starts with the most units and strongest industry of the North. However, they usually do not pose a threat to any of the other northern nations due to internal struggles and problems. As such, smaller nations can attempt to conquer smaller, weaker ones without intervention. However, they must do so quickly and prepare a solid defense, because their time is limited.\n\nThe North of Griffonia will see itself invaded throughout the early midgame by §YThe Griffonian Empire§!. They will be among the first to be targeted by §Ythe Empire§!, and as such do not have as much time to build up and grow stronger as other nations in different regions of Griffonia. Because of this, the North usually stands a very poor chance of defeating the Empire, and it requires a lot of skill (and a fair bit of convenient luck) to defeat the behemoth that is §YThe Griffonian Empire§!.\n\nThe North is a relatively empty, undeveloped chain of mountains, hills and flatland that lacks noteworthy industry. You are very weak at the start of the game, and must acquire strength quickly to avoid conquest through the claws of §YThe Griffonian Empire§!."
 EAW_WS_Central_Griffonia:0 "Central Griffonia"
 EAW_WS_Central_Griffonia_desc:0 "Central Griffonia encompasses relatively flat grassland, but also incorporates some small mountain ranges. The Region has a generally moderate, if not high amount of §YInfrastructure§!, which makes the supplying and transportation of troops easy.\n\nCentral Griffonia starts out as a disunified cluster of nations, all having a small to decent industrial base. It is noteworthy that §YThe Griffonian Empire§! starts the game with several vassals under their control, and will be busy conquering these vassals to eventually become a strong industrial and military might on the Continent.\n\nCentral Griffonia is, in almost every way, dominated by §YThe Griffonian Empire§!. They start the game with several vassals under their control, most of which will eventually leave them. The Empire can quickly reclaim and conquer these vassals, however, only to unify most of Central Griffonia and become a powerhouse industrially and militarilly. As a vassal of the Empire, it is hard to avoid being crushed by §Ythe Empire§!, though as other nations in Central Griffonia, you are given until the midgame to prepare for an invasion by them.\n\nThe generally flat terrain and good infrastructure of Central Griffonia provides a great spot for military expansion. However, nations will find themselves at great risk, seeing as how they are dangerously close to §YThe Griffonian Empire§!."
 EAW_WS_Eastern_Griffonia:0 "Eastern Griffonia"
 EAW_WS_Eastern_Griffonia_desc:0 "Eastern Griffonia features a large variety of terrain, ranging from long, deep rivers and grassland, all the way to mountains and forests. The region features moderately developed §YInfrastructure§!, most of the time, though this can vary from one country to another.\n\nThe East features a relatively small industry at the start of the game but can build up a decent one throughout the game, which aids with further expansion and conquest.\n\nThe East has two big contenders for power, one being §YThe Griffon Revolutionary Army§!, which is located further to the south and can grow very rapidly through Conquest. The other big political instance is §Ythe River Federation§!, a loose net of pony nations that aim to protect against outside threats, mainly the griffons and particularly the Empire. Throughout the game, various nations inside §Ythe Federation§! will strive towards unifying the Federation into a single nationstate under their control, and any other surrounding nation would be best of with preventing this, as a unified Federation can easily overpower most neighbouring nations.\n\nThe East, due to the deterrence from §YThe River Federation§!, finds itself largely protected from outside threats, even from the §YGriffonian Empire§!. This offers much needed safety to eastern nations, giving them extra time to build up and acquire territory.\n\nEastern Griffonia encompasses long mountain ranges, deep rivers, and flat grassland, and offers a safe haven from §YThe Griffonian Empire§! and other griffon invaders, resulting in a sometimes more relaxed, definitely not peaceful playthrough. The ultimate goal of the East is to either prevent or strive for the unification of the River Federation, depending on their choice of nation."
 EAW_WS_Southern_Griffonia:0 "Southern Griffonia"
 EAW_WS_Southern_Griffonia_desc:0 "Southern Griffonia encompasses a variety of terrain, mainly flatland to west and more mountainous areas to the east of the Region. Due to this, this region is inherently split in half with Infrastructure levels. Countries in the Southwest of Griffonia, like §YWingbardy§! have a much higher Infrastructure level and easier time to supply troops than the nations to the Southeast within the mountains, like §YSicameon§!. This regions offers access to the Sea, though very few nations possess a capable Navy at game start.\n\nThe South features a moderate amount of Industry. Rapid industrialisation can give a nation the edge it needs over less developed neighbours in order to defeat them.\n\nThe South is politically and militarilly dominated by §YThe Kingdom of Wingbardy§! at the start of the game. They feature a much stronger Industry than any other southern nation, as well as a very strong military. In addition to this, they are the Leader of a powerful faction, the 'Karthinian Pact', which can act as a roadblock for smaller nations trying to grow in power within the region. §YWingbardy§! typically chooses a radical political path, such as fascism, and you should thus expect them to be wanting to expand and, at worst, wanting to kill you. A good defense against them is thus a good recommendation.\n\n§YThe Commonwealth of New Mareland§! is also a noteworthy mention for this region, as they are the second most developed nation in this Region and are a subject of the major power of §YEquestria§!. Due to this, attacking them can be very dangerous, though if they decide to strive for independence, they can end up very vulnerable.\n\nWith the start of the lategame, §YThe Griffonian Empire§! will most likely be knocking on the door of the South, ready to conquer the entire Region. As a nation in the South, it is ultimately your task to survive this onslaught and defeat the Empire, though this is very challenging indeed, seeing as how §YThe Empire§! will have incorporated most of its territories back into its realm by the time they strike the South.\n\nThe mix of flat and mountainous terrain in the south makes it a moderately difficult area to traverse, while nations like §YWingbardy§! and, ultimately, §YThe Griffonian Empire§! will attempt to wreak havoc in the region. A nation must play their cards right in order to successfully expand without walking into certain doom."
 EAW_WS_Western_Griffonia:0 "Western Griffonia"
 EAW_WS_Western_Griffonia_desc:0 "Western Griffonia is a mostly flat and hilly region, with very few mountains. Despite this, the Infrastructure across the Region can vary largely, though it is usually at a moderate level. This region offers access to sea and houses a great naval power, §YThe Skyfall Trade Federation§!.\n\nThe Industrial capacities of the various nations in the west vary, though they usually feature at least a moderate, if not good industrial power. With these varying levels of infrastructure, it is an easy task for the stronger nations to eat up smaller, weaker ones before dealing with more dangerous enemies.\n\nWestern Griffonia is visibly dominated by §YThe Kingdom of Aquileia§! and its various vassals. It incorporates a good, strong early-game industry with a healthy amount of divisions. Due to this, §YAquileia§! could easily overrun smaller opponents. However, their political choices might distract them for long enough to keep yourself as a smaller nation and acquire more strength in the meantime.\n\nThrough the midgame, western Griffonia will be put to the ultimate test, as §YThe Griffonian Empire§! makes it way to reclaim its former territories, which includes all of the West. A Player will find that even a strong Aquileia will usually end up crushed under the Empire's hell, leaving the rest of the Region ripe for the taking.\n\nThe flat and hilly landscape of the West, combined with the decent amount of Infrastructure provide nations with the terrain that they need to wage quick wars and supply troops. §YAquileia§! is the regional power that one would need to protect themselves against, but in order to last throughout the midgame, a nation has to prepare and defend against §YThe Griffonian Empire§!. The West offers you a challenging experience, and a race against time."

 EAW_WS_DED_desc:0 "§YThe Dread League§! is little more than a collection of necromancers who live on the fringes of society. They have little industry or technology save ancient magic and outdated factories.\n\nOfficially the lands of §Ythe Dread League§! are owned by §Ythe Arcturian Order§!, and have been for centuries. The knights however, know better. After the fall of the Empire of Undeath, §Ythe Dread League§! endures on the fringes of society. The ancient dark magic of the world will always tempt the curious, as they have now.\n\nAn evil unknown calling has brought together necromancers from across the globe to the very spot where the Empire of Undeath was defeated long ago, the frozen north. There, they gather to form the necromancer's council for the time is right to choose a leader to guide them on a path to world conquest once again.\n\nThe ancient dead stir. Will the mortals be ready to face the oncoming tide, or will hordes of flesh and bone consume them all?"
 EAW_WS_HLR:0 "[Root.GetNameDef] - The Wardens of the North"
 EAW_WS_HLR_desc:0 "The North - it is cold, dark, and sparsely populated. Upon it lies §Ythe Arcturian Order§!, an ancient holy order founded around the faith and ideals of 12 churches dedicated to the sanctity of The Holy Light.\n\nA Thousand years ago, on the long night, necromancers came pouring from the east. Large armies of undead cadavers in tow, they nearly overwhelmed the the lands now known as §Ythe Arcturian Order§!. Local church militant were the only ones capable of doing anything to stem the tide and push them back.\n\nThe century that followed saw §Ythe Arcturian Order§! being formed by §YDesmond the Fell-Claw§!, Holy Father of the Sun Goddess. §YThe Arcturian Order§! was created for the sole purpose of protecting the living from the foul denizens from the east.\n\nEver since that fateful day nine hundred years ago, they have done their job.\n\nRecent years have written a different story however, as something is amiss in the Dread Peninsula. Border raids have increased in frequency and unicorns in the Order have felt dark energies accumulate beyond the borders. The twelve churches believe themselves ready to weather the storm.\n\nThe question is though, are we really ready for this?"
 EAW_WS_EQC:0 "[Root.GetNameDef] - Friends Across the Sea"
 EAW_WS_EQC_desc:0 "Over 400 years ago the first pony traders lead by Coltlumbus settled on the coast of Southern Griffonia and founded the colony of Celestia. Since then, years of immigration, colonisation and one-sided trade deals have resulted in the §YCommonwealth of New Mareland§!. A beacon of Equestria on Griffonian shores.\n\nWhile nominally still part of §YEquestria§!, New Mareland has its own government in the Commonwealth Congress and is subject to its own laws and regulations. The lax regulations in industry and employment laws, along with the valuable griffon market, lead to many Equestrian businesses setting up in New Mareland.\n\nHowever, on the 29th October 999, the New Manehattan stock market crashed. In what has become known as §RBlack Wednesday§!, thousands of New Marelanders suddenly found themselves without a job and the nation's economy fell into turmoil.

In 972 the §YOrder of Hellquil§! sacked §YDiamond Mountain§!, forcing King Tug the Boneless to sign the treaty making Diamond Mountain the first non-pony member.\n\nEven with the collapse of the Griffonian Empire, the Treaty of Coltstream holds strong and many are calling for further close cooperation between the treaty members. Perhaps even leading to the formation of a united §YRiver Federation§!. However, the lands of the Riverponies are not without their own problems. Differences in ideologies, beliefs, and economic and society development levels all stand in the way of progress. And while the griffon threat has subsided, it won't be long until a new threat rises in the west."

However, as it turns out, ruling as a King over a horde of Bandits is not very efficient nor easy, and §YEriviar§! quickly lost control over most of his 'subjects'.\n\nOne thing kept the Bandits united however: their hatred for §Rthe Empire§!. Their raids on imperial soil had ravaged the countryside and economy to the south, and it forced §YEmperor Grover V§!, the Empire's current reigning monarch, to sue for a peaceful solution with the Bandits.\n\nA temporary solution to the problem was soon found, and §YEriviar and Grover§! agreed on a pact that disallowed §GBandit raids§! on imperial soil in return for imperial economic and military support. This helped §YEriviar§! to secure his Kingdom for the moment, though §YGrover V§! is now old and his health is declining quickly.\n\nIf §Ythe Emperor§! dies, the pact with §Ythe Bandits§! will come to an end. But how secure and stable is this §YBandit Kingdom§! of Eriviar really? Has the King of Bandits done enough to suppress and prevent §Rradicals§! from taking power? Will he see reason and seek to reform the mess of a society he has so little control over?\n\nThe time is running out fast for §Ythe Emeperor§!. Eriviar must be careful to make sure that his does not."

Trapped in between two giants of Griffonia, §RAquileia§! and §Rthe Empire§!, §YGreifwald§! must be careful not to cross the line with either of the two parties, or they risk agitating them and losing their independence, once more.\n\nWithin the nation itself, multiple different solutions to this problem have been proposed. There are §Rradicals§! and §Rmoderates§! on both sides, some more... 'reasonable' than others. The §Ycommunists§! believe that the two great aristocracies to our north and south are threatening the sovereignty of our workers, and that we must do everything we can to protect ourselves against this §Rmenace§!. §YThe moderates§! on the other claw see this challenge as a balancing act, believing that we must seek to befriend, or appease, both sides equally in order to preserve as an independent nation.\n\nThere is a third voice in the room, however. §YThe Prelate§! has approached §Ythe Duke§! and offered his help with the situation. He sees how weak and vulnerable we are, and offers the §Yhelp of the church§! to support our efforts. A great deal, though... can this Griffon truly be trusted, in the end?\n\nWhatever the case, §YGreifwald§! stands at the edge of extinction shortly after its recreation.

 EAW_WS_BRF_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Brodfeld, nested east of the hold of the §RBlackrock bandits§!, has always been one of the more isolated kingdoms of Griffonia. A land of forests and rice-sown marshes, this eastern kingdom has long been the domain of the §Yde Kissau family§!. It never knew the prestige and power of some of its western neighbors. It never experienced the true might of the Griffonian Empire when it was at its height, and its Griffons were never high in the thoughts of the Imperial family. Yet being at the periphery of the Griffon world has its advantages.\n\nWhen the Empire stagnated and then collapsed in an orgy of revolution and bloodshed, §YBrodfeld§! was effected only in the most minor of ways. The Griffons of Brodfeld had never depended on the Empire for sustainability or defense in any real fashion. This meant that when the Empire shattered, Brodfeld merely returned to the relative peace and stability that it had always known. It made no difference to them who sat upon the Imperial throne, or indeed, if the Empire existed at all.\n\nFor many generations, the §Yde Kissau line§! has ruled the lands of Brodfeld, with only minor local disturbances breaking the illusion of permanent peace. However, times were changing, and the world would not wait on Brodfield to catch up. New ideas such as §RCommunism§! slowly but surely leaked their way to the common Griffons of Brodfield. The de Kissau family had always been rather §Gautocratic§! in their rule, and to the peasant class, the ideals and results promised by communism seemed a plausible solution. His majesty.\n\n§YKing Kloseu de Kissau§!, was determined to nip such traitorous thoughts in the bud. His harsh reaction, combined with several incidents across the nation, boiled over in 1005. In that year, the traitor, §RFilip Redglad§!, rallied many commoners into open defiance of the King. Lines were drawn, shots exchanged, and §RCivil War§! was the result. The Royalist forces were pushed back into more loyal areas of the nation, whilst the Communists continued to press them. For years, the conflict has raged on. A war of Brother against Brother, blood has been spilt across the once tranquil land of Brodfeld. Families have been torn apart by differing loyalties, and what remains of hope is all too often only a dim light. Fields lay burnt and blackened even as famine looms over the nation as a whole. Many Griffons are on the brink of starvation. And now, after two years of gruesome warfare, the Communist dogs have prepared for what they hope is their §Rfinal push§!. Those loyal to his majesty the King have determined to throw back §Rthe Red Tide§!, and restore order to the shattered Kingdom, by any means necessary.\n\nThe time has come for the Royalists and all true to the throne to come together as one and show the Traitors that they shall never prevail!

Now there are few griffons that even remember its name...\n\nYet the wheel of fate turns once again. The winds of change have undone the §YGriffonian Empire§! and it is a mere shell of what it used to be. Luckily for Arantiga, the Barony aligned itself with §YThe Kingdom of Wingbardy§!, so the consequences of the Empire’s collapse have not been as severe for the country as they have been for the northern half of the continent. Economically, Arantiga can choose to stick with Wingardy, whose economy is now suffering as well, or to cut itself loose from Wingbardian influence.\n\nThe Featherin dynasty still leads the country, but no griffon in their family has ever reached the height of Arantigos. §GMargareth Featherin§!, the current leader of the country, cannot compare to the greatness of ancient Arantiga. And with another generation of mediocrity, some want to bury the dreams of empire and reform the country along the lines of the ideologies that dominate recent Griffonian history. However, the Baroness’s younger brother, §YDorotheos§!, is a promising general. His eyes shine as bright as those of the great conqueror himself! Some whisper that he should take the throne. Some still believe Arantiga can rule again. That a new Arantigos will rise to lead his people to greatness. To reshape the world in his own image and march an Aratigan army to the ends of the world. The die will soon be cast. The future of Arantiga will change forever."

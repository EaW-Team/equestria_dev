 EAW_WS_TAB_3_TXT:0 "\n\n£eaw_text  §YEquestria at War§! incorporates a fork of §YExpanded Technology + Industry + Equipment§! by §YGreatexperiment§! (used with permission), that has been edited and streamlined to fit our design goals better. This allows for a longer game with more technologies to research.\n\nEaW introduces §YMagical Equipment§! and a new resource - £resources_strip|7  §YCrystals§! - used to produce it. §YMagical Equipment§! provides a more resource, IC-intensive, less reliable, but more powerful alternative to regular §YInfantry Equipment§!.\n\n§YPre-Industrial Infantry Equipment§! and §YArtillery§! have been added, to represent the weapons used by nations that have not yet industrialized.\n\nFurthermore, EaW introduced the §YRaces§! system. Each country has one of five races - §Ypony§!, §Ychangeling§!, §Ygriffon§!, §Ydeer§! and §YUnspecified§! (with more races planned). Each race has its own unique racial tech tree folder, and in some cases racial unique units. Races cannot be changed during the game (exception being an option for the §YChangeling-Olenian Commonwealth§!).\n\n\n\nIn order to better represent the differences in industrial/societal and research development of nations in Equestria at War, §YDevelopment§! and §YScientific Development§! idea categories have been implemented.\n\n§YDevelopment§! represents the general state of industrialization and advancement of economy and society. Low levels of §YDevelopment§! impose §RIndustry§!, §RResearch§! and §RPolitical§! maluses. §YDevelopment§! can be improved by §YNational Focuses§! or §YDecisions§!, depending on the country.\n\n§YScientific Development§! represents the level of education and research capabilities of the nation. Low levels of §YScientific Development§! impose §RResearch§! maluses. §YScientific Development§! can be improved by §YNational Focuses§! or §YDecisions§!, depending on the country. For §Ygriffon§! countries, owning major centers of learning in Griffonia can be used to improve §YScientific Development§! as well.\n\n\n\nThe potential of nuclear warfare and the horror of unleashing such terrible weapons is not quite seen in Vanilla. In order to rectify this, EaW introduces the following changes:\n- Nuclear attacks will now reduce the population of a hit §Ystate§!, using believable casualty numbers depending on state population and development (using multiple nuclear bombs on a state in short succession will not reduce population as drastically).\n- A §Ystate§! hit by a nuclear attack will receive the §YFallout§! state modifier, reducing state factories, supplies, division organization and increasing division attrition. The modifier will last for a §Yyear§!. Subsequent nuclear attacks will not stack the modifier, but will reset the one year timer.\n- Production of §Ynuclear bombs§! requires a supply of £resources_strip|7  §YCrystals§!. If none are available, no new §Ynuclear bombs§! will be produced. Each §YNuclear Reactor§! consumes 12 £resources_strip|7  §YCrystals§!.\n\n\n\nAfter a country has been defeated in a war, and a peace conference has ended, the victors will have a chance to receive §Yone-time 50% research speed bonuses§! to §Ytechnologies§! that the loser had researched, and the victor has not.\n\nThe chance to receive the bonus is random, and calculated per technology. The more of loser's §YIndustry§! that has been taken over by the victor (either by puppeting or annexation), the higher the chance to receive a bonus, which means that not every victor will have an equal chance. The level of §YDevelopment§! of the victor is also a factor - the worse the Development, the smaller the chance.\n\n\n\nAn effort was made to improve the AI. While it is by no means perfect, and most of the real improvements can only be implemented by Paradox, we have done our best to tweak AI's behaviors, and improve AI's handling of Division Templates. AI will use all of the added units and technologies. AI will intelligently choose Doctrines based on the bonuses they recieve in their Focus Tree. AI will use dynamic strategies to respond to events and changes on the world stage. Peace Conference AI has been improved, though it is not perfect.\n\n\n\nSince 1.6 Ironclad update, new Game Rules for various countries and game setups have been added, to allow the player to customize their £eaw_text  §YEquestria at War§! experience.\n\n\n\n£eaw_text  §YEquestria at War§! provides a new, flavorful system of general, admiral and, for players with the La Resistance DLC, operative generation. Various nations will generate different leaders of different races depending on their circumstances. For example, a nation may have both pony and griffon generals, or use multiple namelists. This does not carry any gameplay changes."

 #Continent
 EAW_WS_Zebrica:0 "Zebrica - Crossroad of Civilizations"
 EAW_WS_Zebrica_desc:0 "Zebrica is a vast and diverse continent, home to more races than both Equus and Griffonia. It is also almost as large as the other two combined. Its climate ranges from the tropical jungles of Hindia to the scorching deserts of Zebhara and to the frozen swamps of Cape Hestraya. Its most advanced societies are comparable to Equestria in their prosperity, while the most backwards ones are little more than isolated tribes. As such, there is little one can say that applies to the continent as a whole. However, Zebrica is a sum of its parts, and each region has its own shared culture and history.\n\nWestern Zebrica is the land of the horses, the larger cousins of ponies who also live there. Besides them, there are sentient cats who walk on two legs in Abyssinia, and the warlike donkeys of Asstyria and Anseruk. Most of the region was once united under Saddle Arabia, but over centuries of decadence and decay the old empire broke apart, and in 1007 is divided into a brutal civil war.\n\nSouthern Zebrica is more diverse, with zebras, hyenas, gargoyles and centaurs living in the cold south. Besides these races, there are also the yeti of Stormland, a ferocious race who united under the black banner of the Storm King and wrought havoc across half the continent. However, Storm King perished in battle, and now the yeti race is divided, and previously conquered races hope that he will never have a true successor.\n\nCentral Zebrica is dominated by the Zebhara desert, but also has the Great Lakes. The Mazwi Empire united the zebras of the Lakes, but Storm King's invasion brought an end to its reign, and now zebra warlords fight each other to determine the fate of the region. While most of the population here consists of zebras, there are also the camels of Camelkand in the east, but most of them live under the reign of a Storm King's general who forged a kingdom of his own through conquest.\n\nThe north has closer ties to Equus and Griffonia than the other regions, and thus is home to many naval powers. The coast is primarily inhabited by zebras, while the islands are home to hippogriffs and harpies. A small holdout of Equestrians exists in Chiropterra, worshipping Nightmare Moon and biding their time until her return. In the northeast, the native deer of the Hindian subcontinent chafe under the yoke of Olenian conquerors, while the llamas of the mountains live in peaceful solitude, worshipping their ruler as a god.\n\nEastern Zebrica is generally considered the most backwater region, which is why Storm King avoided it almost entirely. Zebras, giraffes and kirin call this region their home, but in recent times Feathisian griffon adventurers have carved realms of their own, looking for treasure and valuable goods to trade. They are attracted by rumours of a Golden City hidden somewhere in the magical jungle of the south-east. The kirin have so far lived in isolation, but they are slowly opening up to the outside world.\n\nYet all this only scratches the surface of Zebrica. It has numerous nations and tribes, each with their own story to tell, and their own path to follow."

 # Regions
 EAW_WS_Northern_Equestria:0 "Northern Equus"
 EAW_WS_Northern_Equestria_desc:0 "The Northern parts of Equus are dominated by cold temperatures and mountainous terrain. Because of this, the region suffers from a debilitating lack of §YInfrastructure§!, making logistics a challenging task.\n\nThe countries in the North of Equus are notably a lot weaker than their neighbours to the South. As such, northern nations require a substantial amount of buildup and time to launch a successful attack on the south.\n\nPolitically and economically, §YNova Griffonia§! starts out as the strongest nation in the North, though it is not quite a regional hegemon, and can be overpowered by other nations, depending on the choices made during the game.\n\nThe North has to worry most about their neighbours to the south, mainly §YStalliongrad§!, the §YChangelings§! and §YEquestria§!. Seeing as how the North lacks infrastructure and industrial capacity in comparison to the southern nations, they are very vulnerable to attacks from their more powerful neighbours. That said, the mountainous and harsh terrain of the North does favor the defender.\n\nThe North offers a region with challenging terrain and tough starting conditions, and one must bide their time and exploit their neighbours to make further expansion outside the region possible."
 EAW_WS_Southern_Equestria:0 "Southern Equus"
 EAW_WS_Southern_Equestria_desc:0 "Southern Equus features a variety of different landscapes, ranging from mountain chains and jungles to snowy forests and flat grassland. Due to the varying sorts of terrain, the level of §YInfrastructure§! can vary a lot between different states. This region also features a long coastline, most of which is controlled by §YEquestria§! at the start of the game.\n\nMost southern nations start the game with a relatively large amount of divisions and/or industry. This makes them big threats to outsiders, though the political landscape of most countries prevents them from breaching out into different regions of the world for a long time.\n\nPolitically, this region is largely dominated by §YEquestria§!, which has the possibility of exerting further influence if they so choose. §YEquestria§! starts out as a disarmed nation, unlike their main rival and opponent, §YThe Changeling Lands§!. They, unlike their Harmonic neighbour, start out with a bigger and more capable army, and aren't as peace-loving either. It is noteworthy that this region usually grows with tension, until §YThe Changelings§! declare war on their rival, as part of §Ythe Great War§!.\n\nThe usual strategy of most countries in this region revolves around a massive industrial and military buildup during the early game, resulting in a great, region-wide war during the midgame, and finally ending in the victory of one side, who will then be in a prime position for global supremacy. Generally speaking, if one wishes to compete in this struggle for power, they would need to be on the winning side during §Ythe Great War§!.\n\nEquestria features a large variety of terrain with varying levels of §YInfrastructure§!, and features some of the most powerful nations in the world. The gameplay is largely based around the central conflict between §YEquestria§! and §YThe Changeling Lands§!, which most of this region will be involved in."
 EAW_WS_Northern_Griffonia:0 "Northern Griffonia"
 EAW_WS_Northern_Griffonia_desc:0 "Northern Griffonia is a mixture of flatland and mountains, with a very low level of §YInfrastructure§! and industrial development. The terrain, low §YInfrastructure§! and harsh weather can make it a challenge to supply your troops efficiently.\n\nThe North of Griffonia features nations with a generally low level of industrial capacity and development. As such, they have a very hard time expanding beyond the borders of their own region, and require a lot of time to build up and eat up other, smaller nations around them. Nations to the East or South could, if they so wished, easily overpower any of the northern nations through industrial and military might, something that northern nations have a hard time catching up on.\n\nThe strongest nation in northern Griffonia is §YThe Griffonian Republic§!, which starts with the most units and strongest industry of the North. However, they usually do not pose a threat to any of the other northern nations due to internal struggles and problems. As such, smaller nations can attempt to conquer smaller, weaker ones without intervention.

They will be among the first to be targeted by §Ythe Empire§!, and as such do not have as much time to build up and grow stronger as other nations in different regions of Griffonia. Because of this, the North usually stands a very poor chance of defeating the Empire, and it requires a lot of skill (and a fair bit of convenient luck) to defeat the behemoth that is §YThe Griffonian Empire§!.\n\nThe North is a relatively empty, undeveloped chain of mountains, hills and flatland that lacks noteworthy industry.

Of these three nations, §Y[NVA.GetName]§! fares the best, as the city of §GBlossom§! has remained a valuable trading port following the collapse of the trade routes in the north, and its lands are not as densely wooded as their two western neighbors.

His son, the newly crowned §YKing Garibald Talonuel III§!, demanded that the lords of Griffenheim and the Imperial Heartlands launch a full investigation into the incident, but his demands fell on deaf ears. In protest, Wingbardy officially seceded from the Empire, taking its former vassals of §YTalouse§!, §YFranmisria§! and §YArantiga§! with it. The Empire, due to the young Emperor and rising instability, was powerless to protest as more and more nations followed in Wingbardy's example.\n\nWeakened by the collapse of the empire, and a long and bloody war with §YFalcor§!, the nation fell into economic crisis. Government after government came to power with the goal of restoring Wingbardy to its former glory, but each government collapsed under the strain and internal strife. Desperate for a solution, the griffons of Wingbardy turned to more drastic solutions.\n\nThe §YPartito Nazionale Fascista§! (National Fascist Party) lead by §YGiulio Beakolini§! has swelled in numbers, especially among the disillusioned veterans of the Falcor war. Beakolini has called for a march on Karthin to seize power from the government to begin rebuilding the nation. Meanwhile the §YPartito Comunista Wingbarda§! (Wingbardian Communist Party) lead by §YAntonino Proletarino§! has vowed to stop any such action. With the threat of §RCivil War§! rising, the government has remained silent on the issue, for now. But what they choose in the coming weeks will seal the fate of the Kingdom.\n\nWhoever takes charge of the government their priority should be to solve the nation's economic hardships. §Ythe Great Famine§! has decimated the already suffering nation. §YUnemployment§! is still rampant and the once mighty industrial sector has fallen behind nations such as §YEquestria§! and §YNew Mareland§!. These issues have also caused many of Wingbardy's best and brightest to leave the nation in search of fortune elsewhere. Finally, there is the issue of the Empire to the north and the communists of §YPrywhen§! to the east, both of whole look upon the Jewel of the empire with envious eyes."

Things got worse as the climate turned colder and colder. The ponies left their homeland and many migrated south, to a new virgin land. Each pony tribe thought they were superior in a way and claimed the land for themselves, but only together could they prevail in the end. Equestrian folklore says that the three leaders of the tribes were locked away in a cave in the middle of a blizzard, and that the only reason they survived was cooperation and friendship. Henceforth, the tribes were united under a common banner and flag: §GEquestria§! was born.\n\nSoon after its foundation, §YPrincess Celestia§! and her younger sister §CPrincess Luna§! were called to lead the ponies of §GEquestria§!. The two Princesses are immortal Alicorns, sharing the abilities of each of the three races, and are powerful enough to raise and lower the Sun and Moon. They were the guardians of §GEquestria§! for a long time and protected it through §Ythe Elements of Harmony§!, defeating great, dangerous enemies such as §RDiscord, the Spirit of Chaos§! and §RKing Sombra§! of the Crystal Empire. §CPrincess Luna§! eventually fell prey to jealousy, however, as ponies did not appreciate the Night she brought and loved her time as much as they loved the Day of her older sister. She transformed into the wicked §RNightmare Moon§!, eclipsed the Sun with her Moon and attacked §YCelestia§!. In desperation, Celestia had no choice but to banish her sister to the Moon for a §Ythousand years§!. A new age began, where §GEquestria§! had a single ruler who raised both the Sun and the Moon.\n\nThis age was a time of peace, growth and development. A treaty of friendship was signed with the Deer of §YOlenia§!, ending their coastal raids for good. Famed explorer Meanderly Polo crossed the ocean and travelled far to the east, where she discovered the eastern pony cousins of the §YRiverlands§!. Another explorer named Coltlumbus founded §YNew Mareland§! in southern Griffonia. Eventually, Jam Wutt would invent the steam engine, heralding the beginning of Equestria's industrialisation. New cities would appear and rapidly grow as the country urbanized and modernized. But while prosperity grew, its distribution was not as equal as some had hoped. After mismanagement of weather followed by food shortages, the region of §YSeveryana§! revolted. Peace in Equestria had come to an end as the §RWinter Revolution§! erupted. Fearing full scale civil war, Celestia had no choice but to make peace, allowing the communist state to exist freely. This uprising was perhaps a sign of things to come.\n\nSeven years ago, at the dawn of a new millenium, Nightmare Moon returned, but six ponies discovered their fate as embodiments the §YElements of Harmony§! and used the magic of friendship to turn her back into Luna, making her leave her evil ways behind her and returning to rule by her sister's side. The six different ponies who embody and hold the Elements of Harmony, the most prominent of which is §YTwilight Sparkle§!, Element of Magic and Princess of Friendship, have faced and defeated evil time and again, protecting §GEquestria§! from tyranny and doom.\n\n§GEquestria§! faces new enemies, however, as the evil §RQueen Chrysalis§! has rallied the disunited §YChangeling Lands§! under her supreme rule in recent history. §RChrysalis§! has already carried out a failed invasion on §YCanterlot§!, the capital of §GEquestria§!, and §YPrincess Celestia§! is worried that she will strike again, this time with full force.\n\nThe sky is growing dark.

They use these powers of deception to get close to victims and feed on their love, a resource which they ravenously seek, though they primarily subsist on flesh. Throughout most of their history they lived in underground §GHives§! and obey §GQueens§!, though they are not an actual hive-mind and possess a free will.\n\nFortunately for their neighbours, their aggression and relative georgraphical isolation caused them to spend more time fighting each other than outsiders, allowing deer and ponies to repel isolated incursions. Despite their insular nature, after Equestria's §Yindustrialization§! the Queens sent infiltrators to bring in technology and expertise. The hives began to modernize, with capitalists and military cartels rising in power to rival Queens.\n\nConflicts became frequent and in 953 an ambitious young §GQueen Chrysalis§! was lucky to rise to power in one of the strongest hives - Vesalipolis. At the time Vesalipolis was already in an alliance with a coastal hive Ditrysium. Leading the armies, Chrysalis fended off multiple attacks from Vraks and minor nothern hives, which affirmed her position as a strong leader. In 962, Lyctida would join the alliance after Chrysalis aided them against zealous deer raiders. She led the alliance to conquer Vraks in 971, and in the next year the §GUnion of Hives§! was formed. Soryth voluntarily joined in 985 and other hives soon followed. For the first time in history, the hives were unified under a single government in 987, and in 988 Chrysalis was crowned §Gthe One Queen Of The Changeling Lands§!, with supreme authority over other queens.\n\nIn the years that followed, there were border conflicts with Olenia and a rise of communism, but during that time Chrysalis plotted a daring coup of Equestria to secure a near-endless supply of love and establish herself as master of all of Equus. During the royal wedding of §RShining Armour§! and §RPrincess Cadance§! in §YCanterlot§!, she managed to take the Princess' form and lower the defences from within, allowing a large swarm to attack the grand capital of §YEquestria§! and capture the leadership of the nation in one fell swoop. Only a last minute intervention of the Elements of Harmony and the overwhelming power of the engaged couple's love saved Equestria from conquest.\n\nFollowing the failed coup, the changelings began to question Chrysalis' authority, with harmonists under §RThorax§! and communists under §RGold Muffin§! rioting in the hives. Chrysalis reacted with extensive propaganda and by crushing the dissenters, forcing them into hiding or exile. Utterly humiliated, she swore revenge on Equestria. Subterfuge had failed her, so it was clear direct, brutal and extreme action would bring her and her subjects victory over the pacifist ponies.\n\nChrysalis began a vast program to modernize and expand the §GChangeling Army§!. An attache was sent to the §YGriffonian Empire§! that had great experience from conflict. With the vast army and rapid militarization, Chrysalis hopes to overcome her enemies with ease, so long as she can maintain her military advantage.\n\nHowever, the Changeling Lands lack many strategic resources vital for the war effort. An opportunity presents itself with a valid and easy target for conquest: the §CKingdom of Olenia§!. It is in political turmoil and is militarily weak. In such a crippled state, it would be more than easy to walk in and seize the land -- and its numerous resources -- for themselves. §RThe deer§! might just be the first ones to feel the combined might and fury of §Gthe Changeling Queendom§!.\n\nSoon, §Rthe puny ponies§! shall tremble, and §Gthe Changelings§! will reign supreme!

Even the griffon Zaphzan tribes in the south had been subjugated. However, all good things must come to an end.\n\nIn 353 the Zaphzans rose up, tired of wearing the pony yoke on their necks. Soon enough unrest spread as the East hungered for freedom. Lake City stood no chance and was defeated.

It was a kingdom ruled by powerful §Cunicorn mages§! who formed the meritocratic upper class of society, and their mastery of the arcane was unrivaled.\n\nBut that was over a millenium ago, in an age almost forgotten. Since then, other Empires have risen and fell, while Wittenland faded to irrelevance. Its meritocracy crumbled as the mages became a decadent hereditary aristocracy, who were content with living a luxurious life in their mountain castles. Other unicorns, as well as the earth pony and pegasus minorities, were forced into serfdom to feed their mighty masters. Wittenland became an isolated, backwards realm.\n\nOver its long history it was attacked by the griffons of the west and the ponies of the north, yet it was only conquered once, by §RGrand Prince Blessed Sword§! of Lake City.

 EAW_WS_NIM_desc:0 "The mountainous coastline which marks the eastern boundary of the River Coalition harbours but little room for pony settlement. The many myths and legends which surround the founding of Nimbusia's first cities tell the same narrative of how the area got settled anyway. The ponies that came to the Riverlands from the north were divided by their tribe; earth pony, pegasus or unicorn. The rugged mountains of Nimbusia were left for the pegasi guardians of the expedition, as they would be easily able to settle the area which was hard to traverse on hoof. Only later did the other tribes make their way into Nimbusia, but this initial divide has left its mark on Nimbusian society today. Initially many disconnected cities, or poleis, dotted the country, but the ponies from §GNimbusi§!, the largest polis, managed to subjugate the other cities with their §Ydisciplined pegasi army.§! Combining discipline instilled from youth and an almost complete lack of ground units, this Nimbusian army has been the marvel of East-Griffonia ever since.\n\nNimbusian society became highly stratified, with many non-pegasi being relegated to the §RHelot class§!, a group barely treated better than slaves - despite the Nimbusians claiming it's just payment for protection from outside threats. These Helots were mostly from conquered cities, the defeat of their ancestors still haunting them today. They, and the non-citizen §YPerioikoi class§! stuck in the middle, were needed to sustain the martial lifestyle of the §Gcitizen-warrior class§! at the top. Although they were, in ancient times, briefly subjugated by §YPrince Blessed Sword§! of what is now called Lake City, the citizens of Nimbusia determine their own fate, voting on laws and other issues in the Assembly of Nimbusi called §Gthe Ecclesia§!.\n\nEven in the modern day, the citizens of Nimbusi see themselves as protectors of not only the Helots, but also of all the Riverponies. The pegasi fondly think back of great deeds such as §GThe Battle of Thermoponylae§!, a glorious final stand where a Nimbusian phalanx stalled the advancing griffons of the west for days, so that the rest of the Riverlands could rally. However, time has not stood still outside the mountains of Nimbusia and the Oracle at Prancetras has predicted a §Rturbulent time§!.\n\nPolitical strife has almost completely stalled all politics in the ancient democracy. Three factions are vying for power. §YThe traditionalists§! seek to uphold the status quo of Nimbusian society. If they want any change at all, they want it to be built on the past and be gradual. They have rallied behind §YPegalaios§!, an old veteran, both of politics and of war. §!The reformists§! have taken inspiration from their allies in the River Coalition. They seek to modernise the economy, to emancipate the perioikoi class into the citizenry and to cooperate more closely with Nimbusia's neighbours. Uniquely, this faction is led by a well-respected unicorn, §YMetakeros§!. Lastly, a coalition of young officers and soldiers, who call themselves §Ythe purists§!, has formed around §YAndreia§!, a young general. These soldiers have had enough of the bickering of Nimbusian democracy and seek to centralise power under the military. However, they are criticised for their complete disdain of foreigners and civilians, especially of the non-pegasus variety.\n\nIt remains to be seen which faction manages to convince the citizens of Nimbusia. The pegasi of Nimbusia are weary of anypony garnering too much popularity and every politician is taught about what happened to those with hubris, who thought they had the crowd on their hooves. §RThe Nimbusians ostracised them.§! Whoever wins the political battle, however, will find perhaps the most fearsome forces of ponies on the continent at their command..."

In a cruel twist of fate, emperor §YGrover II§! was struck down by a Nimbusian hoplite in 854. Halted in its track, the empire withdrawed from the §GRiverlands§! and entrusted the region known as the §YGriffonian Frontier§! to two new nations: the §ROrdenstaat of Hellquill§! and the §RCounty of Longsword§!.\n\nThe §ROrdenstaat of Hellquill§! was a military frontier ruled by the Order of Brothers of the Griffon House of Prelate Aloysious in Cloudbury. Though they regrouped and prepared for a renewed crusade, emperor §YGrover III§! showed no interest in such a conquest and so the disciples of Prelate Aloysious settled down in their newfound status of wardens of the east. Ruling over many ponies, they attempted to teach them the ways of the Griffonian gods. Some accepted these teachings, becoming known as the §YPozniaks§! while others revolted from time to time though always in vain.\n\nMany years of honourable service to the Empire passed. Pony raids were successfully defended against and some offensives were even successfully carried out. In 973, the proud knights under the command of §YHochmeister Siegfried Trappenfeld§! sacked §RDiamond Mountain§!, bringing back their treasury as loot. To many knights, it felt as the herald of a newfound era of crusade. However, trouble soon loomed over the Empire, which was increasingly shaken by greed and internal conflict.

 EAW_WS_LNS_desc:0 "The territories which nowadays compose §Ythe County of Longsword§! have served as the natural barrier between Griffonia and the Riverlands for millennia, coveted by conquerors from East to West. Around one millennium before Luna’s banishment, the region began to see its first inhabitants, Riverpony tribes moving in from the east and settling in Longsword - the ancestors of the Longsword ponies of today.\n\nLongsword was shaped by its geographical position, its sparse population, and history. Having to defend themselves by incursions from all sides and protect their way of life meant that Longsword ponies became naturally more warlike and stubborn than the ponies of the Riverlands, whereas the forests and marshes of the region divided them into numerous disparate tribes. While they would occasionally unite against a common foe or join together in raids on foreign lands, they generally kept to themselves, holding onto a simple, tribal, communal way of life even when all of their neighbours moved on to feudal kingdoms.\n\nIn the following centuries, population pressures and ambitious tribal chiefs in Longsword would push the ponies to start mounting on raids to collect loot from surrounding kingdoms. Their river boats would reach as far as Herzland in the West and Rijekograd in the East. The Griffon estates were their primary target, however, and made Longsword ponies, and thus River ponies in general, into a bitter enemy of Herzland. To counter these raids, knightly orders tasked to defend the Griffon eastern frontier began to form - the Knightly Orders of §YHellquill§! (Order of Brothers of the Griffon House of Prelate Aloysious in Cloudbury) and §YRosewood§! (The Brotherhood of the Rosewood Spear) are the most famous ones. Even before the Crusades, these Orders waged a series of wars against the tribes in modern day Longsword and Hellquill, but they faced by bitter resistance from the tribes - they used the forests and marshes to their advantage in order to wittle down entire armies to nothing via attrition.\n\nIn §Y787 ALB§!, the Longswordian ponies would begin to unite under the leadership of an ambitious ruler, §YŽemaitukas§!. A worshipper of §YVarėnė, the Goddess of the Hunt§!, he subjugated the Longswordian tribes and founded the town of Varėna, which he envisioned as the religious center of Longsword. The “§YGrand Duchy of Longsword§!” he founded was short-lived, however - at §Y812 ALB§!, §YGrover II§! began the first of his many Crusades towards the East, and Longsword was his first target. It was torched, conquered and Žemaitukas fell against a Griffon blade. His achievements were larger than life, however - it is thanks to him that the concept of a united Longsword even exists.\n\nLongsword was granted to §Ythe House of Dusktalon§! after its conquest as reward for their faithful service in the Crusades, and became an Imperial March. As a condition, however, Western Longsword was granted the Rosewood Order, much like their brothers of the sword on the other side of the Griffking. Grover II’s solution was to require the monarchy to share its powers with the Order and its institutions, in the form of an advisory council. This compact stayed, and the county prospered. Though it was seen as a place for Griffon colonization, the Longswordian ponies received basic rights and most of them remained in their tribes as tenant farmers as long as they paid taxes. This colonization and pony presence would start to form a different culture as well, a so-called "§YOst-Griffonian§!" identity, which, while technically Griffonian, sees itself as something different regardless.\n\nHaving already grown distant from the Griffonian heartland in the centuries prior, Longsword severed the last of its ties with Griffenheim during the §YRepublican Revolution of 978§!, and abandoned its Imperial March status. Longsword's era of prosperity soon came to an end, however. The new Count of Longsword, §YPallas§!, took a step in the opposite direction. After having come into contact with the §YReformisten§!, or 'the Black Cloaks', a Griffon supremacist organization, Pallas was converted to their creed and became a mindless follower of their ideas. He abolished the advisory legislature of the Rosewood Order and initiated the §YLongswordian Genocide§! against the pony population, making two enemies at once and sending the County careening towards an inevitable §Rcivil war§!."

The sheer size of the empire and the proximity to Griffenheim allowed Yale to specialise on providing §Guniversity education§! to the imperial elite. §GYale University§!, in the capital of the duchy, was founded in 765 ALB, with other Yalish cities soon following with their own centres of learning.\n\nOver the next century, these universities would attract students from all over the continent, growing in prestige and wealth within the duchy while technology advanced into the industrial age. However, the advent of industrialism saw the landowning nobility grow ever poorer, while the universities and cities blossomed. Yale itself lost more prominence in the place of Greenback, the industrial heart of the duchy.\n\nIn the fateful year of 878, the ducal family was nearing bankruptcy and they were forced to sell of their ducal title to Yale University itself, letting the prestigious institution rule the country in their stead. As to not provoke the wrath of Griffenheim, Yale kept the nobility and the duchy alive in name, under the first Rector Magnificus of the country, §GBorean Wiedergreiff§!, polymath, architect and scholar. The eccentric and charismatic father of modern Yale had the foresight and imagination to dream up inventions well ahead of his time, some which have still §Ynot been made into a reality§!. He moved the capital from Yale to §GGreenback§!, a central location, finishing a shift in the centre of power that had started at the beginning of the 9th century.\n\nWhen §Rthe republican revolution§! swept through the Imperial Heartlands in 978, Yale saw the majority of the nobility flee the country and the universities took advantage of this by formalising their power in the formation of §Gthe Yale Rectorate§!, vowing to strive for more autonomy from Griffenheim. Although the universities had trained many republicans, the Rectorate was on the fence between supporting either side, only throwing their weight behind the Emperor when his victory was already certain.\n\nIn 1007 ALB, university rule has §Ystagnated§!, and the citizens of Yale feel alienated from the government. The Empire is crumbling, but only the allegiance to the Emperor and the perceived competence of the government is keeping the growing and impoverished lower class in check. If the Yale Rectorate wants to stay in power when the empire's influence retreats from the land and continue the scientific vision of Borean Wiedergreiff, it will have to win the §Rhearts of the people§!.\n\n§YRector Magnificus Mikusian§!, the leader of the Council of Rectors, might soon be forced to make compromises with the more radical factions in the universities. He would like to pursue welfare through scientific innovation, caring for the common griffon through optimisation of the government's efficiency. If he can accomplish this, perhaps Yale can remain a beacon of higher learning for all of Griffonia.\n\nOthers seek to use science to advance their own ideologies. §gGamia University§! sees ethics as hurting the pure pursuit of knowledge and seeks to undermine the ethical standards of research that keep science pure. For this they have allied with §CBruma University§!, which has strong backing from the Triarchy. The professors there believe that only religion can help restore the social bonds between the griffons and their rulers. In §RCyrusval§!, however, they believe that these very bonds between authority and the proletariat cause the suffering in Yale. In the red halls of its university, the professors teach that the march of history will only be complete when every unjust hierarchy is abolished.\n\nWith the §YEmperor's worsening condition§!, decisive action might have to be taken soon.

For hundreds if not thousands of years, the plains of Verenia, the region where our noble house is currently located, were but mere extensions of various other states. No great lords and realms were born in these wild grasslands, or at least knowledge of such empires was lost after §YAquilean Kingdom§! extended it's borders east.\n\nHowever Aquilean dominance over these plains wasn't eternal and unquestionable. Many others desired these lush grasslands, now filled with rich towns and cities, most notably §Yhouse Eyrie§! of §YDuchy of Verenia§!. Of course while the so proclaimed §Y"Lords of Sun and Moon"§! were powerful, their might was nothing compared to the one of §YDiscrets§!. Such status quo would be changed with the rise of the champion of Boreas - §YGrover I of Griffonstone§!. The ambitious king desired to unite all of griffonkind under his banner and thus set out on a great campaign of conquest and subjugation. \n\nNot all realms chose to resist Grover however, some joined him willingly. One of such states was Verenia under §Yduchess Adelina§!, who was one of the first to bend the knee to the future Emperor. Due to this, during the war against Aquilea, the armies bearing the banner of sun and moon fought under the banner of the Idol of Boreas. The forces of Verenia fought bravely and valiantly and thus Grover I saw it fit to reward Adelina with a §Gtruly generous gift§! - half of the Verenian region, nearly increasing the size of the Duchy three times. \n\nThis realm remained relatively rich and prosperous during the Imperial period, even if certain problems - such as the §Rinability to advance and modernize§! at same pace as certain other regions and the ever growing animosity between the nobility which was split between Aquileans and Herzlanders. Even the attempt of eliminating such problems by spreading members of Eyrie across the realm only lessened the problems and in some cases even worsened them, as part of the royal family assimilated into the regions assigned to govern, creating the cadet branch of §YErie§!. \n\nThe culmination of this slow decline would come after the §RGriffonian revolutions§! and the counter revolutions that followed. Verenia was devastated by not only the §Rrepublicans of the Heartlands§!, but also by the surge of §RAquilean revolutionaries§!. This completely devastated the realm as many of it's nobles and even members of house Eyrie and the cadet branch Erie were executed, leaving an old, now childless monarch on the throne and 2 potential successors with an equally valid claim - §YIovinus Eyrie§! and §YDuke Vincent Erie§!. Successors, who on the death of the duke, were unwilling to bend and admit the other to be superior and decided that blades were better at deciding such matters than words, §Rdeclared war on each other, splitting the state into two§!. \n\nAt first it seemed that Vincent would win, with the larger part of the former realm behind him, however due to actions of §YLady Katrina Rivertail§!, this didn't happen. Being the aunt of both pretenders to the throne and unwilling to participate in a conflict between her dear nephews, she broke off her own would be state, proclaiming herself the §Ymatriarch§! of the newly formed §!House Avian§!.\n\nHowever such a choice had quite the negative result. With Rivertail domains leaving House Erie, depriving them of substantial amount of troops and industry, the front of the kinslaying war stagnated, §Rresulting in over a decade of bloody warfare§!. Not to mention that such swift breaking up of the Duchy of Verenia resulted in the newly created House Avian facing countless problems themselves - most notable of which is the ever growing §Rcultural and linguistic divide§! and antagonism between the non-noble population. Of course this isn't even mentioning the perilous position of existing between Heartlands and Aquilea.\n\nWill House Avian manage to rise from the shackles of feudalism and linguistic divide and survive through the upcoming storms?

While their origins are cloaked in myth and legend though, their reasons for leaving their home were clear: oppression by a §Rforeign pony monarchy§! that had seized control of their lands and did not care about their plight. Upon arriving in the §CAsterion Archipelago§! the ships of the fleet spread out to found twenty-one colonies, four of which were located on the mainland. Those twenty-one colonies formed themselves into a §Cconfederation§! to democratically settle any internal and external disputes. This lasted for hundreds of years until a crisis came about that allowed an ambitious politician to declare himself §Rking§!. The new kingdom would end up lasting for longer than the democracy that preceded it, but it was always a hollow existence. Non-compliance was was commonplace, and both in secret and abroad the Asterionese would continue to advocate for freeing the homeland of tyranny. This would all come to an end when the Griffonian Empire attacked.\n\nWhen §YEmperor Grover I§! invaded the eastern griffon principalities in 747, he famously marched across the §GCreeper Mountains§! and caught them by surprise, for they had expected him to come from the north or the south. The principalities were soon subjugated, but the Kingdom of Asterion protested. The mountains had belonged to them and the Emperor refused to cede them back. When he heard the minotaurs' demands, his response was harsh: he §Rcrushed§! the Asterionese army and §Rannexed the mainland states§!, which later became the §RCounty of Cyanolisia§!. However, he could not invade Asterion itself without a fleet, so peace was settled. The monarchy had been decisively weakened, so when §REmperor Grover II§! came in 799 to secure supply lines for his crusade against the eastern ponies and to teach the south a lesson in humility, Asterion did little to resist. §YThe Imperial Navy§! blockaded the archipelago, a massive army landed and the King §Rsurrendered§! after a single engagement.\n\nFrom that time on a darkness would settle across the land as the native population was forced to abide by §RImperial rule§!. Democracy was forbidden, minotaurs were rendered second class citizens in their own land, and native religions such as Actualism were suppressed in favor of the Imperial pantheon. When the Empire fell into §Grevolution§! Asterionese forces organized to overthrow the puppet government in what became known as the §CRestoration War§!, with generous support from §GSicameon§!. They were successful in liberating the archipelago, and the government that emerged was a representative democracy based around the rule of law, rather than the rule of monarchs. The revolution was unable to spread to the mainland, however, and this soon formed the basis of public consciousness. The next twenty-eight years were marked extensive planning for a §Gcontinental invasion§! and massive build up of the navy and army. The good times would not last however, and indeed by the time 1007 of the Equestrian calendar rolled around political deadlock had set in. The nation of Asterion now finds itself divided, with a §Rcoalition of nationalists and communists§! gaining popularity by advocating radical policies that change the status quo. Outsiders think this will lead to a civil war, but they miss a key point of the Asterionese national spirit: They are so fearful of monarchies that civil war is off the table for every minotaur in the nation for fear that as soon as they start shooting at each other foreigners will attack and enslave them once again. Two phrases unite the nation: §C"We shall reclaim the mainland!"§! and §R"Death to imperialists!"§!"

 EAW_WS_MAN_desc:0 "Many titles have been bestowed upon the great megalopolis of §CManehattan§! throughout the centuries: The Three Boroughs; The Big Apple; The Empire City; Caput Mundi - the §YCapital of the World§!.\n\nPrior to the §YGreat War§!, Manehattan and its satellites, §CHayston§! and §CBronclyn§!, had constitued more than a §Gquarter§! of Equestria's industrial capacity. A hub for trade and commerce, steeped deep in history, powerful and sophisticated enough to rival Canterlot in its technological, cultural, and political influence, there is no doubt that the City that Never Sleeps was the §Ycrown jewel of the Equestrian realm§!.\n\nToday, Equus lies beneath the §GChangeling jackboot§!, as the victorious armies of §RQueen Chrysalis§! goosestep through the wartorn cities of Equestria, harbingers of the incipient §RPax Chrysalia§!. The §GHegemony§! reigns supreme on one continent, and as their §YProtectorates§! rise from the ashes, the §RLady Protectress§! watches over her demesne with a hawk's eye. Manehattan was brought low by the War, but under the guidance of the §YProtectress§!, there is no doubt that the city will soon reclaim what had been lost, to rise again remade into a §Cglittering metropolis§! of the §GHegemony§!.\n\nThe §Cponies§! of the §YEquestrian East Coast§!, though, have their own desires. Encompassing not only §CFillydelphia§! and §CAlbion§!, but also a stretch of inland territory reaching §CHollow Shades§! in the west and bordering §CSeveryana§! in the north, the §YGarrison§! is woefully understrength for the task of pacifying the entirety of the East Coast. All over the Protectorate, the §RHarmonic Resistance§! plots to overthrow the Changeling occupiers, to restore the ideals of §Yfreedom§! and §Yliberty§! to the ponies of Equestria.\n\n§CStarlight Glimmer§! and §CTrixie Lulamoon§!, both former comrades of §YPrincess Twilight Sparkle§! and powerful unicorns in their own right, stand at the forefront of this growing tide of unrest. Charismatic, cunning, and peerlessly capable, the invisible hoofprints of this §Rrevolutionary duo§! can be found imposed on the myriad of crises already beleaguering the §GChangeling administration§!. Beset on all sides by a conquered people bent on §Rvengeance§!, the §GProtectress Lilac§! will have to use all her wits in the coming years if her nascent reign is to weather the aftershocks of §REquestria's demise§!."

 EAW_WS_ELF_desc:0 "All over Equestria, from Appleloosa to Vanhoover, a §Yrevolutionary calling§! beckons to those ponies who still stand defiant against the §RChangeling oppressor§!. Under the banner of the §CEquestrian Liberation Front§!, dissidents and ideologues of all stripes stand together, paying no heed to the doctrinal quibbles and internecine infighting that once plagued the subversive left and right alike, united in their common dream of a §Gfree Equestria§!.\n\nFrom Stalliongrad to New Mareland, be they of the §YThree Tribes§!, or thestrals, griffons, or hippogriffs, the brave fighters of the E.L.F. have converged, from all over the world, to gather on the plains of the §YEquestrian East Coast§!. Alongside the §GHarmonic Resistance§! - now risen from the shadows - they take up arms to participate in this §YLiberatory Endeavour§!. The thirst for freedom had always burned within the hearts of the ponies living under the Changeling jackboot, and from those embers, a veritable firestorm has now erupted to scour the Queendom's black taint from Equestria's fair lands.\n\nIt is not the immortal alicorn Princesses that stand at the forefront of this insurrection, nor the famed heroes of Ponyville, but §CStarlight Glimmer§! and §CTrixie Lulamoon§! - now matriarchs of the revolution, heirs to the fallen Diarchy. The uprising was borne not out of their visionary imaginings alone, but from the sacrifices of ponies bled and killed in the collective struggle against the invader; it is the blood, tears, and sweat of these unsung heroes that serve as the glue binding together the constituent parts of this §Ynascent revolution§!.\n\nAt the dawn of what may well be Equestria's penultimate struggle, the ponies rally under a flag of the Sun and Moon §Ycombined§! - two symbols of Equestria united, flanked by swords drawn in their defense - in what may be the rebirth - or the last hurrah - of the §YCradle of Ponykind§!."

 EAW_WS_WAR_desc:0 "In time immemorial, the §Ytwelve Warzenian tribes§! united as a single great kingdom that dominated the land between §YMaregypt§! and present-day §YColthage§!. Generations of kings passed and eventually the kingdom split in two with §YColtbaon§! to the east and §YMulei§! to the west. Though the people where politically divided, the two kingdoms remained united in §Yloyalty, faith and friendship§!.\n\nEver pious to their one and only god, §YZel§!, the Zebras of Warzena live peaceful lives of farmers and merchants with cloths, grain, olives and dates being their main exports. However, their wealth couldn’t protect them for ever and three times the kingdoms had been conquered and three times they had returned stronger them before. For over 400 years the kingdoms of Warzena lived in peace and prosperity, but everything changed with the §YStorm King§! attacked.\n\nThe nation fell quickly to the Storm King’s wrath and all Warzenian fell into slavery. Their olive orchards where bulldozed and replaced with airship docks. Their rivers dammed for power to drive the mills and factories creating weapons and merchandised for the Storm King. But after 15 years the Storm King died, and his garrison fled as quickly as they had appeared. The zebra and mules of Warzena where quick to throw off their shackles and proclaim themselves free once again. They offered up all they owned to Zel, the One True God, Zelyon—the Lord Upon High, in thanks for their salvation. §YZavid§! of the House of Zarizel, cousin of the former king of Coltbaron and nephew of the king of Mulei, was anointed by the §Yhigh priests§! to be the king of a new, reunited Kingdom of Warzena.\n\nBut the new Kingdom is in dire shape. The §Rland was ravaged§! by the Storm King and its §Rbeings starve§!. Worse still, in an act of ultimate curtly and blasphemy the §YGreat Temple in Yarzelyiayim§! was §Rdemolished§! and replaced by a great statue to the conqueror. And outside their borders the resurging Maregypt and Colthage seek to gain influence over the land. And to the north nightmares awaken from their slumber from beneath the mountains."

 EAW_WS_NCR_desc:0 "War. War never changes.\n\nIn the year 2270, prospectors discovered a long-forgotten vault under the Sierra Nevada Mountains. In the vault was a gateway that lead to another world, untouched by the atomic fires that ravaged the Earth long ago. News of this gateway to paradise quickly spread and §YPresident Wendell Peterson§! of the §YNew California Republic§! ordered an expedition to be sent through.\n\nThey created a settlement on the other side of the portal in a world free of toxins and radiation. The community grew and explorers set out in search for more land. But it soon became apparent that they weren't alone in this new world.\n\nThis land was home to a race of intelligent quadrupeds called §YPonies§!, sharing the name with ancient depictions of a creature from earth. Relations were peaceful at first but attempts of trade failed to bear fruit. The ponies weere seemingly without want and weere in abundance of food, water, medicine and natural resources. They were happy to offer quantities to the expedition for free and teach the expedition how to work the land around the Gateway. But little of the goods the NCR could offer satisfied the local ponies enough for large-scale trade.\n\nThe desire for resources, and the lack of trade to the locals convinced the Peterson administration that there could only be one course of action: the full-scale colonisation and integration of this strange new world. The further the NCR's troops marched, the more resistance they encountered. Soon skirmishes broke out between the two equally matched sides. A stalemate settled in. In the year 2273, or the year 1005 in the Equestrian calendar, the §YTreaty of Las Pegasus§! was signed between the NCR and the §YEquestria§!. The NCR's border would remain in its current position in exchange of recognition of both sides. All ponies were also to be treated freely and equally as full citizens of the NCR.  Finally trade deals would be drawn up between the two nations, allowing the flow of goods the NCR so desperately needed.\n\nNow under §YGovernor-Colonel Jameson§!, the §YNew California Expedition§! is experiencing a boom as the NCR's most prized possession. Safe, secure, it is the paradise the Earth so desperately needs.\n\nBut even this world is not safe from war. Tension between this world's superpowers are rising, fuelled by familiar old desires. The NCR might soon find itself fighting not against mountain bandits or desert raiders, but against an industrial and military might not seen in 200 years. Only time will tell what the outcome will be. After all, war never changes."

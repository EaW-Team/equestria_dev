 EAW_WS_TAB_3_TXT:0 "\n\n£eaw_text  §YEquestria at War§! incorporates a fork of §YExpanded Technology + Industry + Equipment§! by §YGreatexperiment§! (used with permission), that has been edited and streamlined to fit our design goals better. This allows for a longer game with more technologies to research.\n\nEaW introduces §YMagical Equipment§! and a new resource - £resources_strip|7  §YCrystals§! - used to produce it. §YMagical Equipment§! provides a more resource, IC-intensive, less reliable, but more powerful alternative to regular §YInfantry Equipment§!.\n\n§YPre-Industrial Infantry Equipment§! and §YArtillery§! have been added, to represent the weapons used by nations that have not yet industrialized.\n\nFurthermore, EaW introduced the §YRaces§! system. Each country has one of five races - §Ypony§!, §Ychangeling§!, §Ygriffon§!, §Ydeer§! and §YUnspecified§! (with more races planned). Each race has its own unique racial tech tree folder, and in some cases racial unique units. Races cannot be changed during the game (exception being an option for the §YChangeling-Olenian Commonwealth§!).\n\n\n\nIn order to better represent the differences in industrial/societal and research development of nations in Equestria at War, §YDevelopment§! and §YScientific Development§! idea categories have been implemented.\n\n§YDevelopment§! represents the general state of industrialization and advancement of economy and society. Low levels of §YDevelopment§! impose §RIndustry§!, §RResearch§! and §RPolitical§! maluses. §YDevelopment§! can be improved by §YNational Focuses§! or §YDecisions§!, depending on the country.\n\n§YScientific Development§! represents the level of education and research capabilities of the nation. Low levels of §YScientific Development§! impose §RResearch§! maluses. §YScientific Development§! can be improved by §YNational Focuses§! or §YDecisions§!, depending on the country. For §Ygriffon§! countries, owning major centers of learning in Griffonia can be used to improve §YScientific Development§! as well.\n\n\n\nThe potential of nuclear warfare and the horror of unleashing such terrible weapons is not quite seen in Vanilla. In order to rectify this, EaW introduces the following changes:\n- Nuclear attacks will now reduce the population of a hit §Ystate§!, using believable casualty numbers depending on state population and development (using multiple nuclear bombs on a state in short succession will not reduce population as drastically).\n- A §Ystate§! hit by a nuclear attack will receive the §YFallout§! state modifier, reducing state factories, supplies, division organization and increasing division attrition. The modifier will last for a §Yyear§!. Subsequent nuclear attacks will not stack the modifier, but will reset the one year timer.\n- Production of §Ynuclear bombs§! requires a supply of £resources_strip|7  §YCrystals§!. If none are available, no new §Ynuclear bombs§! will be produced. Each §YNuclear Reactor§! consumes 12 £resources_strip|7  §YCrystals§!.\n\n\n\nAfter a country has been defeated in a war, and a peace conference has ended, the victors will have a chance to receive §Yone-time 50% research speed bonuses§! to §Ytechnologies§! that the loser had researched, and the victor has not.\n\nThe chance to receive the bonus is random, and calculated per technology. The more of loser's §YIndustry§! that has been taken over by the victor (either by puppeting or annexation), the higher the chance to receive a bonus, which means that not every victor will have an equal chance. The level of §YDevelopment§! of the victor is also a factor - the worse the Development, the smaller the chance.\n\n\n\nAn effort was made to improve the AI. While it is by no means perfect, and most of the real improvements can only be implemented by Paradox, we have done our best to tweak AI's behaviors, and improve AI's handling of Division Templates. AI will use all of the added units and technologies. AI will intelligently choose Doctrines based on the bonuses they recieve in their Focus Tree. AI will use dynamic strategies to respond to events and changes on the world stage. Peace Conference AI has been improved, though it is not perfect.\n\n\n\nSince 1.6 Ironclad update, new Game Rules for various countries and game setups have been added, to allow the player to customize their £eaw_text  §YEquestria at War§! experience."

 # Regions
 EAW_WS_Northern_Equestria:0 "Northern Equus"
 EAW_WS_Northern_Equestria_desc:0 "The Northern parts of Equus are dominated by cold temperatures and mountainous terrain. Because of this, the region suffers from a debilitating lack of §YInfrastructure§!, making logistics a challenging task.\n\nThe countries in the North of Equus are notably a lot weaker than their neighbours to the South. As such, northern nations require a substantial amount of buildup and time to launch a successful attack on the south.\n\nPolitically and economically, §YNova Griffonia§! starts out as the strongest nation in the North, though it is not quite a regional hegemon, and can be overpowered by other nations, depending on the choices made during the game.\n\nThe North has to worry most about their neighbours to the south, mainly §YStalliongrad§!, the §YChangelings§! and §YEquestria§!. Seeing as how the North lacks infrastructure and industrial capacity in comparison to the southern nations, they are very vulnerable to attacks from their more powerful neighbours. That said, the mountainous and harsh terrain of the North does favor the defender.\n\nThe North offers a region with challenging terrain and tough starting conditions, and one must bide their time and exploit their neighbours to make further expansion outside the region possible."
 EAW_WS_Southern_Equestria:0 "Southern Equus"
 EAW_WS_Southern_Equestria_desc:0 "Southern Equus features a variety of different landscapes, ranging from mountain chains and jungles to snowy forests and flat grassland. Due to the varying sorts of terrain, the level of §YInfrastructure§! can vary a lot between different states. This region also features a long coastline, most of which is controlled by §YEquestria§! at the start of the game.\n\nMost southern nations start the game with a relatively large amount of divisions and/or industry. This makes them big threats to outsiders, though the political landscape of most countries prevents them from breaching out into different regions of the world for a long time.\n\nPolitically, this region is largely dominated by §YEquestria§!, which has the possibility of exerting further influence if they so choose. §YEquestria§! starts out as a disarmed nation, unlike their main rival and opponent, §YThe Changeling Lands§!. They, unlike their Harmonic neighbour, start out with a bigger and more capable army, and aren't as peace-loving either. It is noteworthy that this region usually grows with tension, until §YThe Changelings§! declare war on their rival, as part of §Ythe Great War§!.\n\nThe usual strategy of most countries in this region revolves around a massive industrial and military buildup during the early game, resulting in a great, region-wide war during the midgame, and finally ending in the victory of one side, who will then be in a prime position for global supremacy. Generally speaking, if one wishes to compete in this struggle for power, they would need to be on the winning side during §Ythe Great War§!.\n\nEquestria features a large variety of terrain with varying levels of §YInfrastructure§!, and features some of the most powerful nations in the world. The gameplay is largely based around the central conflict between §YEquestria§! and §YThe Changeling Lands§!, which most of this region will be involved in."
 EAW_WS_Northern_Griffonia:0 "Northern Griffonia"
 EAW_WS_Northern_Griffonia_desc:0 "Northern Griffonia is a mixture of flatland and mountains, with a very low level of §YInfrastructure§! and industrial development. The terrain, low §YInfrastructure§! and harsh weather can make it a challenge to supply your troops efficiently.\n\nThe North of Griffonia features nations with a generally low level of industrial capacity and development. As such, they have a very hard time expanding beyond the borders of their own region, and require a lot of time to build up and eat up other, smaller nations around them. Nations to the East or South could, if they so wished, easily overpower any of the northern nations through industrial and military might, something that northern nations have a hard time catching up on.\n\nThe strongest nation in northern Griffonia is §YThe Griffonian Republic§!, which starts with the most units and strongest industry of the North. However, they usually do not pose a threat to any of the other northern nations due to internal struggles and problems. As such, smaller nations can attempt to conquer smaller, weaker ones without intervention. However, they must do so quickly and prepare a solid defense, because their time is limited.\n\nThe North of Griffonia will see itself invaded throughout the early midgame by §YThe Griffonian Empire§!. They will be among the first to be targeted by §Ythe Empire§!, and as such do not have as much time to build up and grow stronger as other nations in different regions of Griffonia. Because of this, the North usually stands a very poor chance of defeating the Empire, and it requires a lot of skill (and a fair bit of convenient luck) to defeat the behemoth that is §YThe Griffonian Empire§!.\n\nThe North is a relatively empty, undeveloped chain of mountains, hills and flatland that lacks noteworthy industry. You are very weak at the start of the game, and must acquire strength quickly to avoid conquest through the claws of §YThe Griffonian Empire§!."
 EAW_WS_Central_Griffonia:0 "Central Griffonia"
 EAW_WS_Central_Griffonia_desc:0 "Central Griffonia encompasses relatively flat grassland, but also incorporates some small mountain ranges. The Region has a varying amount §YInfrastructure§!.\n\nCentral Griffonia starts out as a disunified cluster of nations, all having a small to decent industrial base. It is noteworthy that §YThe Griffonian Empire§! starts the game with several vassals under their control, and will be busy conquering these vassals to eventually become a strong industrial and military might on the Continent.\n\nCentral Griffonia is, in almost every way, dominated by §YThe Griffonian Empire§!. They start the game with several vassals under their control, most of which will eventually leave them. The Empire can quickly reclaim and conquer these vassals, however, only to unify most of Central Griffonia and become a powerhouse industrially and militarilly. As a vassal of the Empire, it is hard to avoid being crushed by §Ythe Empire§!, though as other nations in Central Griffonia, you are given until the midgame to prepare for an invasion by them.\n\nThe generally flat terrain and good infrastructure of Central Griffonia provides a great spot for military expansion. However, nations will find themselves at great risk, seeing as how they are dangerously close to §YThe Griffonian Empire§!."
 EAW_WS_Eastern_Griffonia:0 "Eastern Griffonia"
 EAW_WS_Eastern_Griffonia_desc:0 "Eastern Griffonia features a large variety of terrain, ranging from long, deep rivers and grassland, all the way to mountains and forests. The region features moderately developed §YInfrastructure§!, most of the time, though this can vary from one country to another.\n\nThe East features a relatively small industry at the start of the game but can build up a decent one throughout the game, which aids with further expansion and conquest.\n\nThe East has two big contenders for power, one being §YThe Griffon Liberation Army§!, which is located further to the south and can grow very rapidly through Conquest. The other big political instance is §Ythe River Coalition§!, a loose net of pony nations that aim to protect against outside threats, mainly the griffons and particularly the Empire. Throughout the game, various nations inside §Ythe Coalition§! will strive towards unifying into a single nationstate under their control, and any other surrounding nation would be best of with preventing this, as a unified Federation can easily overpower most neighbouring nations.\n\nThe East, due to the deterrence from §YThe River Federation§!, finds itself largely protected from outside threats, even from the §YGriffonian Empire§!. This offers much needed safety to eastern nations, giving them extra time to build up and acquire territory.\n\nEastern Griffonia encompasses long mountain ranges, deep rivers, and flat grassland, and offers a safe haven from §YThe Griffonian Empire§! and other griffon invaders, resulting in a sometimes more relaxed, definitely not peaceful playthrough. The ultimate goal of the East is to either prevent or strive for the unification of the River Federation, depending on their choice of nation."
 EAW_WS_Southern_Griffonia:0 "Southern Griffonia"
 EAW_WS_Southern_Griffonia_desc:0 "Southern Griffonia encompasses a variety of terrain, mainly flatland to west and more mountainous areas to the east of the region. Due to this, this region is inherently split in half with Infrastructure levels. Countries in the Southwest of Griffonia, like §YWingbardy§! have a much higher Infrastructure level and easier time to supply troops than the nations to the Southeast within the mountains, like §YSicameon§!. This regions offers access to the Sea, though very few nations possess a capable Navy at game start.\n\nThe South features a moderate amount of Industry. Rapid industrialisation can give a nation the edge it needs over less developed neighbours in order to defeat them.\n\nThe South is politically and militarilly dominated by §YThe Kingdom of Wingbardy§! at the start of the game. They feature a much stronger Industry than any other southern nation, as well as a very strong military. In addition to this, they are the Leader of a powerful faction, the 'Karthinian Pact', which can act as a roadblock for smaller nations trying to grow in power within the region. §YWingbardy§! typically chooses a radical political path, such as fascism, and you should thus expect them to be wanting to expand and, at worst, wanting to kill you. A good defense against them is thus a good recommendation.\n\n§YThe Commonwealth of New Mareland§! is also a noteworthy mention for this region, as they are the second most developed nation in this Region and are a subject of the major power of §YEquestria§!. Due to this, attacking them can be very dangerous, though if they decide to strive for independence, they can end up very vulnerable.\n\nWith the start of the lategame, §YThe Griffonian Empire§! will most likely be knocking on the door of the South, ready to conquer the entire Region. As a nation in the South, it is ultimately your task to survive this onslaught and defeat the Empire, though this is very challenging indeed, seeing as how §YThe Empire§! will have incorporated most of its territories back into its realm by the time they strike the South.\n\nThe mix of flat and mountainous terrain in the south makes it a moderately difficult area to traverse, while nations like §YWingbardy§! and, ultimately, §YThe Griffonian Empire§! will attempt to wreak havoc in the region. A nation must play their cards right in order to successfully expand without walking into certain doom."
 EAW_WS_Western_Griffonia:0 "Western Griffonia"
 EAW_WS_Western_Griffonia_desc:0 "Western Griffonia is a mostly flat and hilly region, with very few mountains. Despite this, the infrastructure across the region can vary largely, though it is usually at a moderate level. This region offers access to sea and houses a great naval power, §YThe Skyfall Trade Federation§!.\n\nThe Industrial capacities of the various nations in the west vary, though they usually feature at least a moderate, if not good industrial power. With these varying levels of infrastructure, it is an easy task for the stronger nations to eat up smaller, weaker ones before dealing with more dangerous enemies.\n\nWestern Griffonia is visibly dominated by §YThe Kingdom of Aquileia§! and its various vassals. It incorporates a good, strong early-game industry with a healthy amount of divisions. Due to this, §YAquileia§! could easily overrun smaller opponents. However, their political choices might distract them for long enough to keep yourself as a smaller nation and acquire more strength in the meantime.\n\nThrough the midgame, western Griffonia will be put to the ultimate test, as §YThe Griffonian Empire§! makes it way to reclaim its former territories, which includes all of the West. A Player will find that even a strong Aquileia will usually end up crushed under the Empire's hell, leaving the rest of the Region ripe for the taking.\n\nThe flat and hilly landscape of the West, combined with the decent amount of Infrastructure provide nations with the terrain that they need to wage quick wars and supply troops. §YAquileia§! is the regional power that one would need to protect themselves against, but in order to last throughout the midgame, a nation has to prepare and defend against §YThe Griffonian Empire§!. The West offers you a challenging experience, and a race against time."

Each pony tribe thought they were superior in a way and claimed the land for themselves, but only together could they prevail in the end.

Over a millenium ago, the northern Wingbardian and Falcorian tribes conquered the §YKingdom of Karthin§! which had splintered from the §RArantigan Empire§!. In the following centuries there were many wars and border changes, with one side dominating the other in turn. This bitter rivalry only came to an end when §YEmperor Grover I§! invaded and subjugated both.\n\nWhat followed was two centuries of peace, which neither Falcorians nor Wingbardians had experienced in a long time. Under Imperial protection, both nations grew and prospered. §GFalcor§!, the capital of the Queendom, grew into a thriving commercial and industrial city, while §GMatton§! attracted many miners and foundry workers. Open trade between the subjects of the Empire meant the border with Wingbardy practically ceased to exist, allowing for free trade and shared wealth.\n\nYet all good things must come to an end.\n\nThe King of Wingbardy was assassinated in 972 and his heir §YGaribald Talonuel§! formally seceded from the Empire. Falcor remained an Imperial subject, but suddenly the border with Wingbardy became relevant again. Already disputes arose over what village and town belonged to which country, but Falcorians relied on the Empire to protect them.\n\nThen the Empire collapsed in the §RGriffonian Revolution of 978§!.\n\nThe Queen of Falcor was left on her own, and tensions continued to grow. Wingbardy could now assert its claims and Falcorians had to step in to defend their own territory. Clashes in the border town of Meranclawo in 985 escalated and both sides moved in reinforcements. Soon enough, the skirmish became a battle, which then became a war.\n\nAfter some initial advance by Wingbardy, the war became a stalemate until 987, when the Falcorian army launced a northern §Ycounter-offensive§! in the Battle of Clawporetto which broke through the Wingbardian lines and routed the 2nd Army. Falcorians advanced rapidly until they reached the flooding river Piumave, where they were stopped. Wingbardy had a chance to dig in and reorganize. Wingbardy called its ally §RFrancistria§! to join the war and attack the over-extended northern Falcorian divisions, and in 989 the §RGaribald Offensive§! began. It broke through Falcorian lines and retook all lost land, and eventually reached §RFalcor itself§!. The Queen had no choice but to sign an armistice to prevent the complete annexation of her country. The war-weary and merciful King Garibald agreed on a harsh term: §RFalcor would be ceded to Wingbardy§!.\n\nThe Falcorian Queendom was in turmoil. The army was in shambles, the economy crumbling, the navy near non-existent, and the §YSicameonese§! had taken the Jojo islands. All the stress inevitably made the Queen ill, leaving her daughter §GPrincess Maximilliana§! as the ruler of the country. Now she has to save her nation from doom before it is too late.

Order was restored and the economy recovered, but it did not take long before everything took a turn for the worse.\n\nIn 1003 an assassination attempt was made on Kloseu as he was spectating a military parade in Kivessin with his wife. He was merely wounded on his cheek, but the Queen perished in his arms. The assassin was shot and killed immediately. Soon afterwards Kloseu blamed the terrorist §RGriffon Liberation Army§! and communists in general for the attempt and began the Hunt. Hundreds of communists and socialists were arrested, but thousands more took up arms and resisted as §RFilip Redglad§! rallied commoners into open defiance of the King. Lines were drawn, shots exchanged, and §RCivil War§! began.\n\nThe Royalist forces were pushed back into more loyal areas of the nation whilst the Communists continued to press them.

The rugged mountains of Nimbusia were left for the pegasi guardians of the expedition, as they would be easily able to settle the area which was hard to traverse on hoof. Only later did the other tribes make their way into Nimbusia, but this initial divide has left its mark on Nimbusian society today. Initially many disconnected cities, or poleis, dotted the country, but the ponies from §GNimbusi§!, the largest polis, managed to subjugate the other cities with their §Ydisciplined pegasi army.§!

However, time has not stood still outside the mountains of Nimbusia and the Oracle at Prancetras has predicted a §Rturbulent time§!.\n\nPolitical strife has almost completely stalled all politics in the ancient democracy.

However, they are criticised for their complete disdain of foreigners and civilians, especially of the non-pegasus variety.\n\nIt remains to be seen which faction manages to convince the citizens of Nimbusia.

So when the local peasants revolted and overthrew him in 720, the Emperor, instead of crushing the dissidents, gave them an offer: The commoners would be allowed to form their own, independent government and in return swear eternal loyalty to the Emperor who would protect them. The offer was accepted and §YGreifenmarschen§! was born. The peasants wanted to prevent the rise of another despotic ruler and thus created an elaborate system of direct democracy, with common referendums on most matters of state, an advisory Council lead by a §YStatthalter§! and elections held every three months. This has allowed every single citizen in Greifenmarschen to participate in politics regardless of status or ideology, but in turn has made the Republic extremely slow to change or reform. For centuries, there was no need for such things as the Emperor ensured their safety.\n\nSadly, the Empire was not meant to last.\n\nIn the tumultuous years preceding and following the §Rrevolution of 978§!, the griffons of Greifenmarschen had to rely on themselves for defence.

When ponies began migrating in Griffonia, the isles became a crossroad from which they could sail to wherever on the continent. It was at that time that the place began to be known as “the §YCrossroad§!”. That is until the newly formed §YGriffonian Empire§! finally turned its eyes on the isles. Faced with the full might of an Empire, the Hauklandish milicias quickly scattered, leaving Haukland to become part of the griffon hegemon.\n\nUnder the imperial yoke, §YHaukland§! saw its role as an invasion springboard maintained but this time, it was turned towards Equus with all of Grover’s imperial might. From there, the §YGriffonian Empire§! conquered and settled §YNova Griffonia§!. However, as naval technology marched on, the isles were reduced to a simple stop in the transcontinental griffonian trade. The settlers who tamed the isles left, seeking more opportunities in the new frontier or back home. And so, §YHaukland§! declined and became a simple fishing province.\n\nWhen the Idol of Boreas was stolen in 971, little changed in Haukland.

And so, when the counter-revolution approached Griffenheim, Meyer simply gathered his pilots and announced to them that they wouldn’t sacrifice themselves in the defense of a fool’s dream. Instead, they would fly away and carve their own place in history. The pilots agreed to follow him. And so, §GMeyer’s Flying Aces§! as they would be later known packed up, hoped in their planes and took off. They ignored all warnings, both from the imperial loyalists or the republicans, stopping only to give air support to a republican officer who simply asked for a favor.

Despite the modernization of ships worldwide, the Hauklandish gained a significant edge on even the best convoys : air support. And so, Meyer’s flying aces and pirates became rich.

However, the advent of industrialism saw the landowning nobility grow ever poorer, while the universities and cities blossomed. Yale itself lost more prominence in the place of Greenback, the industrial heart of the duchy.\n\nIn the fateful year of 878, the ducal family was nearing bankruptcy and they were forced to sell of their ducal title to Yale University itself, letting the prestigious institution rule the country in their stead. As to not provoke the wrath of Griffenheim, Yale kept the nobility and the duchy alive in name, under the first Rector Magnificus of the country, §GBorean Wiedergreiff§!, polymath, architect and scholar. The eccentric and charismatic father of modern Yale had the foresight and imagination to dream up inventions well ahead of his time, some which have still §Ynot been made into a reality§!.

The Empire is crumbling, but only the allegiance to the Emperor and the perceived competence of the government is keeping the growing and impoverished lower class in check.

He would like to pursue welfare through scientific innovation, caring for the common griffon through optimisation of the government’s efficiency. If he can accomplish this, perhaps Yale can remain a beacon of higher learning for all of Griffonia.\n\nOthers seek to use science to advance their own ideologies. §gGamia University§! sees ethics as hurting the pure pursuit of knowledge and seeks to undermine the ethical standards of research that keep science pure. For this they have allied with §MBruma University§!, which has strong backing from the Triarchy.

No great lords and realms were born in these wild grasslands, or at least knowledge of such empires was lost after §YAquilean Kingdom§! extended it’s borders east.\n\nHowever Aquilean dominance over these plains wasn’t eternal and unquestionable. Many others desired these lush grasslands, now filled with rich towns and cities, most notably §Yhouse Eyrie§! of §YDuchy of Verenia§!. Of course while the so proclaimed §Y“Lords of Sun and Moon”§! were powerful, their might was nothing compared to the one of §YDiscrets§!. Such status quo would be changed with the rise of the champion of Boreas - §YGrover I of Griffonstone§!. The ambitious king desired to unite all of griffonkind under his banner and thus set out on a great campaign of conquest and subjugation. \n\nNot all realms chose to resist Grover however, some joined him willingly. One of such states was Verenia under §Yduchess Adelina§!, who was one of the first to bend the knee to the future Emperor. Due to this, during the war against Aquilea, the armies bearing the banner of sun and moon fought under the banner of the Idol of Boreas. The forces of Verenia fought bravely and valiantly and thus Grover I saw it fit to reward Adelina with a §Gtruly generous gift§! - half of the Tarrin region, nearly increasing the size of Verenia three times. \n\nThis realm remained relatively rich and prosperous during the Imperial period, even if certain problems - such as the §Rinability to advance and modernize§! at same pace as certain other regions and the ever growing animosity between the nobility which was split between Aquileans and Herzlanders. Even the attempt of eliminating such problems by spreading members of Eyrie across the realm only lessened the problems and in some cases even worsened them, as part of the royal family assimilated into the regions assigned to govern, creating the cadet branch of §YErie§!. \n\nThe culmination of this slow decline would come after the §RGriffonian revolutions§! and the counter revolutions that followed. Verenia was devastated by not only the §Rrepublicans of the Heartlands§!, but also by the surge of §RAquilean revolutionaries§!. This completely devastated the realm as many of it’s nobles and even members of house Eyrie and the cadet branch Erie were executed, leaving an old, now childless monarch on the throne and 2 potential successors with an equally valid claim - §YIovinus Eyrie§! and §YDuke Vincent Erie§!. Successors, who on the death of the duke, were unwilling to bend and admit the other to be superior and decided that blades were better at deciding such matters than words, §Rdeclared war on each other, splitting the state into two§!. \n\nAt first it seemed that Vincent would win, with the larger part of the former realm behind him, however due to actions of §YLady Katrina Rivertail§!, this didn’t happen. Being the aunt of both pretenders to the throne and unwilling to participate in a conflict between her dear nephews, she broke off her own would be state, proclaiming herself the §Ymatriarch§! of the newly formed §!House Avian§!.\n\nHowever such a choice had quite the negative result. With Rivertail domains leaving House Erie, depriving them of substantial amount of troops and industry, the front of the kinslaying war stagnated, §Rresulting in over a decade of bloody warfare§!.

Nevertheless the small city-states retained their independence, too busy with mutual bickering to join together. This proved to be perilous when §REmperor Grover II§! began his crusades in the Riverlands in 810. He had crushed Sicameon and subjugated Asterion in the west, meaning Gryphus found itself surrounded, its sea routes controlled by the mighty §YImperial Navy§!. When Grover II arrived, one by one the city-states kneeled before their new overlord, too divided to resist. They were forced to supply his large armies as they campaigned in the eastern land of the ponies. Later the §RKnightly Order of Opinicus§! was established in their lands by Grover II to guard the southern border of the Empire.\n\nAfter Grover II perished in battle, §YGrover III§! maintained peace within his realm. This allowed Gryphus to prosper once again as they could now trade freely within the Empire. During this time the Sicameonese §YSouthern Continent Company§! received a charter from the Emperor and gained exclusive rights to commerce in the southern seas and became very influential within Gryphus. More migrants arrived from Sicameon, further increasing the §Rcultural divide§! within the nation.\n\nDuring the Empire's collapse in 978 the towns were left without a master and seized the opportunity to regain their long lost liberty. However, this time the city-states would unite under one banner and form a single nation: Modern Gryphus, lead by an elected §YCouncil§!, was born. But the aftermath of the Empire's rule remains. Zealous knights of §ROpinicus§! wish to go on the offensive against pony heathens and the §RTrade Company§! continues to accrue more power and wealth. It is clear these issues must be resolved if Gryphus wishes to return to her roots as a free, peaceful and prosperous land."
 EAW_WS_MIT:0 "[Root.GetNameDef] - The Free Minotaur Archipelago"
 EAW_WS_MIT_desc:0 "1470 years ago a rag tag fleet of seven ships traveled across the sea from the land of Knosos (now known as §YNimbusia§!), led by a minotaur named §MAster§!. The minotaurs were born from an unholy union between a bovine queen and a strange creature sent by the gods, or so the legend goes. While their origins are cloaked in myth and legend though, their reasons for leaving their home were clear: oppression by a §Rforeign pony monarchy§! that had seized control of their lands and did not care about their plight. Upon arriving in the §MAsterion Archipelago§! the ships of the fleet spread out to found twenty-one colonies, four of which were located on the mainland. Those twenty-one colonies formed themselves into a §Mconfederation§! to democratically settle any internal and external disputes. This lasted for hundreds of years until a crisis came about that allowed an ambitious politician to declare himself §Rking§!. The new kingdom would end up lasting for longer than the democracy that preceded it, but it was always a hollow existence. Non-compliance was was commonplace, and both in secret and abroad the Asterionese would continue to advocate for freeing the homeland of tyranny. This would all come to an end when the Griffonian Empire attacked.\n\nWhen §YEmperor Grover I§! invaded the eastern griffon principalities in 747, he famously marched across the §GCreeper Mountains§! and caught them by surprise, for they had expected him to come from the north or the south. The principalities were soon subjugated, but the Kingdom of Asterion protested. The mountains had belonged to them and the Emperor refused to cede them back. When he heard the minotaurs' demands, his response was harsh: he §Rcrushed§! the Asterionese army and §Rannexed the mainland states§!, which later became the §RCounty of Cyanolisia§!. However, he could not invade Asterion itself without a fleet, so peace was settled. The monarchy had been decisively weakened, so when §REmperor Grover II§! came in 799 to secure supply lines for his crusade against the eastern ponies and to teach the south a lesson in humility, Asterion did little to resist. §YThe Imperial Navy§! blockaded the archipelago, a massive army landed and the King §Rsurrendered§! after a single engagement.\n\nFrom that time on a darkness would settle across the land as the native population was forced to abide by §RImperial rule§!. Democracy was forbidden, minotaurs were rendered second class citizens in their own land, and native religions such as Actualism were suppressed in favor of the Imperial pantheon. When the Empire fell into §Grevolution§! Asterionese forces organized to overthrow the puppet government in what became known as the §MRestoration War§!, with generous support from §GSicameon§!. They were successful in liberating the archipelago, and the government that emerged was a representative democracy based around the rule of law, rather than the rule of monarchs. The revolution was unable to spread to the mainland, however, and this soon formed the basis of public consciousness. The next twenty-eight years were marked extensive planning for a §Gcontinental invasion§! and massive build up of the navy and army. The good times would not last however, and indeed by the time 1007 of the Equestrian calendar rolled around political deadlock had set in. The nation of Asterion now finds itself divided, with a §Rcoalition of nationalists and communists§! gaining popularity by advocating radical policies that change the status quo. Outsiders think this will lead to a civil war, but they miss a key point of the Asterionese national spirit: They are so fearful of monarchies that civil war is off the table for every minotaur in the nation for fear that as soon as they start shooting at each other foreigners will attack and enslave them once again. Two phrases unite the nation: §M"We shall reclaim the mainland!"§! and §R"Death to imperialists!"§!"

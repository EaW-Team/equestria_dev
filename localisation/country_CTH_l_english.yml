 ### LEADER DESCRIPTIONS ###
 POLITICS_ZALATHEL_ZARCA_DESC:0 "A the son of Zamilcar Zarca, former-head of the powerful Zarca family and longest serving Consul of Colthage, Zalathel grew up in Colthaginian high-society during a period of peace and prosperity. However, all that changed when the Storm King attacked.\n\nDespite joining his father in the defence of the city, the Storm King's forces overwhelmed the defenders and Zalathel was forced to abandon Colthage with his two brothers. The zebra fled high into the Ponytus Mountains to lead a guerilla force to harass the Storm King's army as it continued to rampage in Northern Zebrica. When news of the Storm King's death reached him, Zalathel led the attack on Colthage itself and executed its collaborationist puppet governors. With the city secure, he was seen as a liberator by many, but did not hesitate to crackdown on any opposition to his faction. He turned to the warlords that had risen up throughout Colthage and those who would not step into line where quickly taken out.\n\nNow the new Sufrit, he has enough strength and support to keep power, but his position is a precarious one. Only time will tell if he will continue the legacy of his father, the position he was groomed for."
 POLITICS_ZANNO_MZELQATID_DESC:0 "#TODO Zanno Mzelquatid is a son of a landowning well-off family in Western Colthage. He attended university in Wingbardy thanks to a government exchange program and there he became part of the ever growing urban middle class that read republican Griffon literature and spoke out against the Zarcid regimen as an affront to Colthage’s Republican traditions.\n\nIn 1006 as the war of independence was dying down, Zanno travelled around the nation gathering support from the recently freed Zebra to campaign for an end of Zarcid tyranny and promised them true political and economic reform. All that had to be done was for them to make their voices heard to the senate. Unfortunately this led to Zanno being arrested a week before the senate voted Zarathal Zarca in as Suffete. Zanno was eventually released from prison on bail, but managed to make his way across the border into the Hippogriff run Zebrican Mandate where he declared the election as illegitimate and began gathering supporters.\n\nPersonally, he is often seen as aloof and often not in touch with reality. In Wingbardy he ended up becoming a fan of Spiritism and believes he is a medium who can talk to the dead and magical spirits. He believes the spirit of his dead brother visited him and told him to dedicate his life to helping others, and to never drink alcohol or smoke. He is also a strong believer in homeopathy over magical or clinical medicines. Regardless, he is well liked by people he meets and is held in high regard by the employees of his plantations. He introduced sweeping education, medical, and social reforms for the plantation and the nearby towns. Building schools and hospitals (staffed by actual doctors thankfully).  He is against slavery and the semi-official class system in the nation and wishes to see a true liberal democratic Colthage. "

 ### FOCUS ###
 CTH_zarcid_legacy:0 "Lean on the Zarcid Legacy"
 CTH_zarcid_legacy_desc:0 "The Zarca family is more than just a powerful political family. To many Colthaginians, the Zarcids are exemplars of the power and glory of the country’s history. By invoking the family name, we will be able to appoint some loyalists to important bureaucratic positions, which should allow us some political momentum to deal with the hampered economy and the unrest in the provinces."

 CTH_bread_or_stick_politics:0 "Bread or Stick Politics"
 CTH_bread_or_stick_politics_desc:0 "Zamilcar Zarca’s bread or stick politics was an informal system of patronage. Less influential chiefs, landowners and other community leaders would get bread or other help for their people in return for backing Zamilcar whenever he needed them while those who refused would be forced out of politics. The Storm King broke a lot of these informal bonds, and it will take time to reforge them."

 CTH_reintroduce_poltical_chiefs:0 "Reintroduce Political Chiefs"
 CTH_reintroduce_poltical_chiefs_desc:0 "The regional divides of Colthaginian society are not a new phenomenon. Zamilcar Zarca dealt with this problem by assigning political chiefs, a local office used to undermine dissidents, which proved effective in the hinterlands. When we lost political control under the Storm King, the system collapsed, but we can bring the chiefs back from retirement to reassert control over the countryside."
 
 CTH_reinforce_the_western_garrisons:0 "Reshuffle the Western Garrisons"
 CTH_reinforce_the_western_garrisons_desc:0 "Guarding the border with Hippogriff occupied Zumidia has been regarded as an easy assignment for years. The zebra in the area are usually loyal, unlike the meddlesome Coltvans. However, rumours of Zanno’s return have fired up the local youth and the lazy garrison is doing nothing to stop their rallies. Replacing the garrison with veterans from Coltva will teach these kids the strength of Colthage."

 CTH_crackdown_on_the_western_bandits:0 "Crackdown on Western Bandits"
 CTH_crackdown_on_the_western_bandits_desc:0 "The lazy western garrisons have let bandits fester in the west, making us look weak and aiding the Maharzaalid movement. With real soldiers now stationed in the area, we can begin to root out the criminals and restore order to the land. Our new political chiefs will investigate bandit strongholds, so we can decisively rid ourselves of this problem."

 CTH_fortify_the_west:0 "Fortify the Zumidian Border"
 CTH_fortify_the_west_desc:0 "The greedy Hippogriffs are still occupying our brethren in Zumidia and tensions along the border are high. State of the art fortifications in the border provinces will serve as anchor points for our defence and bases for our inevitable assault. Aztarte, the war goddess, will not allow another inch of zebra land be conquered."

 CTH_expand_the_coastal_forts:0 "Zam’s Redoubts"
 CTH_expand_the_coastal_forts_desc:0 "Our ports are the heart of our prosperity and the rivers the veins that spread our wealth to the rest of the people. Zam is the god who oversees this great system of life, and he does so justly. However, Dargon, Lord Under the Sea, known as The Dark One, envies Zam’s wealth, striking the surface from his dark domain. Just like wise Zam, we must defend our heart from attacks out of the depths of the sea."

 CTH_fortify_the_capital:0 "Bastion Tanit"
 CTH_fortify_the_capital_desc:0 "Colthage is our home, our mother. Without her, we would be nothing. It is Tanit, the stalwart wife of Za’al, who wept when Colthage was sullied by the Storm King. Upon Tanit, Zalathel Zarca has taken a precious oath, swearing that never again our homes will be in peril. We will build a bastion that will become our sacred guardian, a true successor to our famed city walls. And Tanit will weep no more."

 CTH_appoint_zakbar:0 "Co-Sufrit Baltazar Zakbar"
 CTH_appoint_zakbar_desc:0 "Zalathel is not fond of Baltazar, who is a boring zebra, seemingly without much ambition. The old stallion’s greatest joy is balancing budgets and his favourite past time chairing board room meetings. However, Zamilcar put great faith in him back in the day, and the commercial faction of the Scientific Clique loves him. And, at least he can do all the paper work."

 CTH_appoint_zaryes:0 "Co-Sufrit Batrun Zaryes"
 CTH_appoint_zaryes_desc:0 "A zebra of true Colthaginian passions, Batrun Zaryes is Zarca’s favoured pick for Co-Sufrit. As a general, Zaryes openly disfavours the Zarcid faction, and he has the ear of the ever-important scientific-clique, representing its militarist wing. Appointing Batrun as Co-Sufrit will not only help prepare the populace for conflict, it should also placate the clique for the time being."

 CTH_draw_up_a_new_constitution:0 "The Zarcid Constitution"
 CTH_draw_up_a_new_constitution_desc:0 "With all the political offices filled, it is time to fully return to political normalcy. For our state to modernise, it will need a solid bedrock to build upon, it needs a constitution. This constitution will enshrine the powers of the First Sufrit to protect the people of Colthage and some formal recognition of the rights of most free zebra should wear down popular support for the radicals."

 CTH_the_coltva_unrest_cat_desc:0 "During the Storm King's invasion, the zebras of the eastern provinces of Coltva took to their mountains with their belongings, hiding what they could from the greedy Yeti. After Storm King's death, the celebrations quickly turned sour as it became clear Colthage had been too weak to protect Coltva. The rich and powerful Colthaginian landowners justified their rule by claiming to be their defenders, yet they had failed in this duty. So what right did they have to keep the common zebra in chains?\n\nOne rebel leader, Zeshmunazash Zeirutid, managed to rally the Coltvans to his cause and is continuing his war of resistance against the Colthaginian government. §RIf we do not deal with the unrest in the region, this could spill over to be a full-blown rebellion.§!"

Despite the result having already been decided before the election, he still campaigned and was able to gather significant support among the urban youth and the Popular Assembly. After the election, and Zalathel Zarca's overwhelming victory, he declared that the election was rigged and invalid. But before the authorities could crackdown on him for inciting unrest he and several supporters had fled across the border to Zumidia.\n\nWe cannot for a moment believe that this would be the end we see of him."

 ### EVENTS ###
 colthage_sicameon_murder.1.t:0 "A Murder in Scarlet"
 colthage_sicameon_murder.1.d:0 "Professor Balazar Zatid of the University of Colthage was found dead yesterday morning at an archaeological dig site in the ancient Colthaginian colony of New Colthage located on the southern coast of the Scarlet. The professor was well renowned among the Colthaginian academic and archaeological communities and was a forerunner in early Colthaginian civilisation. He had travelled to the island of Scarlet to continue his work of excavating the remains of the ancient Colthaginian town of New Colthage. Early reports say that he was found having been beaten, strangled, shot, and stabbed with his own pickaxe. Local authorities have yet to bring forth any suspects, but there is no doubt that this will spill over into a major diplomatic incident between our two nations.\n\nColthage's ancient history in Griffonia has always been controversial to many Griffonians, who reject the idea of any substantial Zebrican civilization on their continent, or even deny any meaningful interactions between our two worlds in the past. This flies in the face of contemporary evidence that Professor Balazar Zatid and many others in both Colthage and Griffonia have uncovered, along with historical accounts and events, such as the famed Karthinian General Gripio Zebracanus who conquered the island of Scarlet for the Karthinian Republic over 1,500 years ago.\n\nSuch a crime has shocked the local community and the hunt for the perpetrators is still ongoing."

 colthage_sicameon_murder.2.d:0 "Professor Balazar Zatid of the University of Colthage was found dead yesterday morning at an archaeological dig site in the ancient Colthaginian colony of New Colthage, in modern-day Sicameon. The professor was well renowned among the Colthaginian academic and archaeological communities and was a forerunner in early Colthaginian civilisation. He had travelled to the island of Scarlet in Sicameon to continue his work of excavating the remains of the ancient Colthaginian town of New Colthage. Early reports say that he was found having been beaten, strangled, shot, and stabbed with his own pickaxe. Local authorities have yet to bring forth any suspects, but the Sicameon authorities assured us that they are treating the matter with utmost urgency.\n\nColthage's ancient history in Griffonia has always been controversial to many Griffonians, who reject the idea of any substantial Zebrican civilization on their continent, or even deny any meaningful interactions between our two worlds in the past.

 colthage_sicameon_murder.3.d:0 "As expected, the Colthaginian ambassador in Midoria has openly and officially asked for an apology from our country in regards to the murder of Professor Zatid. Our ambassador notes that newspapers in the Zebrican nation have been printing inflammatory editorials, accusing the Scarlatans and griffons in general of denying their history and of racial supremacy. Naturally our government doesn’t support such notions, but the Colthaginian government has taken the opportunity to look tough towards their own people with both claws. Or both hooves, to be more apt.\n\nEither way, the ball is now in our park. There is no easy solution here, as our investigators have not found any evidence or even any suspects and delaying a response to the ambassador would only escalate tensions further. We could give an apology for something we had no claw in and lose face towards our own people, but put the case to rest, or take a stand against Colthage’s demands and risk putting fuel on the fire of protests overseas, perhaps forcing Colthage to take more drastic actions."

The Sicameonese government proposed a government allowance for the victim’s family and a plaque to be placed at the crime scene commemorating the professor’s contributions to understanding of our shared histories.\n\nIt seems this generous gesture has calmed tensions across the country, and the press has already started speculating about closer trade ties and a new appreciation of the shared history between grifons and zebra."

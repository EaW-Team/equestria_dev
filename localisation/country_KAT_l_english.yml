KAT_the_mad_princess:0 "The Mad Princess' Reign"
KAT_the_mad_princess_desc:0 "The title held by Diellza von Katerinburg within her Principality and beyond is "The Insane". Even the most diehard monarchist are forced to concede that the princess in Katerinburg embodies the trappings of hereditary rule. There is no escape from a mad ruler. Her insanity has driven many civil servants and advisors away from her court and makes finding people to work with her government a difficult task. Her antics have ruined whatever remained of Katerin's reputation amongst the Herzlanders. She has attained the dubious achievement of making Katerin known worldwide as a buffoon state. At best."

KAT_the_Deadlands_desc:0 "Katerin has long been known as a deadweight to the Empire. Even before the reign of Diellza, Katerin was among the poorest regions in the Empire, covered by the dark Scheißwald forest and vast marshland. Things have only gotten worse during Diellza's mad rule. The once booming trade city of Katerinburg was forcibly relocated from the Griffking deeper into the marshes, the nobles abused Diellza's state of mind to gain more privileges at the expense of the peasants and mismanagement became rampant. Sanitation, healthcare and education are all crumbling, like all of Katerin is."

KAT_glitterhoof:0 "Glitterhoof"
KAT_glitterhoof_desc:0 "Glitterhoof is a unicorn skull gifted by Wingfried to his cousin Diellza several years ago. Since then, she has developed an interesting relationship with this inanimate object. Glitterhoof is Diellza's lover and rival, husband and enemy, depending on the day and Diellza's mood. Sometimes she wants to marry it, sometimes shatter it. This also means Diellza is completely uninterested in any suitors and nobles fear what would happen if their new Prince would be a lifeless pony skull."

### National Focuses ###

KAT_do_own_work:0 "Reign of the Mad Princess"
KAT_do_own_work_desc:0 "Ever since the revolution ended, Diellza von Katerinburg, only surviving child of the previous regent, has reigned over the lands of Katerin. Ascending the throne at the age of 7 after her family's death, she was for many years guided by advisors and powerful nobles. These have not gone away, and they remember the power they had back then."
KAT_assign_yesmen:0 "Expand The Katerintreue"
KAT_assign_yesmen_desc:0 "The Katerintreue are still somewhat limited in power and influence, and if they are to be able to guide the nation more effectively they must make sure to attract likeminded griffons to take a seat at their table. Letting go of power is not in a good politician's nature, of course, but if the power gained outweighs the one lost then it would be foolish to not invite the more useful."
KAT_infiltrate_the_orders:0 "Infiltrate the Orders"
KAT_infiltrate_the_orders_desc:0 "The knightly orders of Katerin have never been very comfortable with the reign of the princess and the Katerintreue. Many within the government fear that they may be plotting to overthrow them. To ensure that such an attempt would be discovered before it can be carried out, several agents of the Katerintreue started to infiltrate the orders, hoping to subvert their power by any means necessary."
KAT_peasant_yesmen:0 "Peasants in the Katerintreue?"
KAT_peasant_yesmen_desc:0 "While the Katerintreue always has been a bastion of noble privileges and rights, the situation they find themselves in calls for extreme measures. In order to more effectively influence the country, maybe even griffons from the lower classes will need to be included. Certain ambitious landowners have amassed great estates during the last years, and could well make acceptable additions to the council." 
KAT_pocketed_yeogriffs:0 "Katerintreue Yeogriffs" #unused
KAT_pocketed_yeogriffs_desc:0 "As the infiltration of the knightly orders continues to its next phase, several of our agents have found themselves in line to be promoted to the position of Yeogriff. If promoted they would be in a much better position to report in on the activities of the guild. Needless to say, supporting these agents should be a priority in the coming weeks."
KAT_armed_taxmen:0 "Armed Tax Collectors"
KAT_armed_taxmen_desc:0 "The griffons of Katerin are, to put it bluntly, destitute. Extracting tax revenues from them is akin to drawing blood from a stone. The solution to this issue is, of course, to smash the stone with a hammer.  From this point onwards, the royal tax collectors of Katerin will carry arms wherever they go, in order to "incentivize" the proper payment of taxes by the populace."
KAT_legalize_banditry:0 "Legalize Banditry"
KAT_legalize_banditry_desc:0 "None can call Diellza von Katerinburg an idle princess, and yet many a griffon has, at times, wished that maybe she was. If she had been, maybe schemes such as her last one would not rise up. There is, of course, something to be said for unorthodox solutions... but maybe this one goes a bit too far?"
KAT_enforcers_of_her_will:0 "Get the Bandits in Line"
KAT_enforcers_of_her_will_desc:0 "Though the bandits are running rampant, their actions being "legalized" has left them less prone to running away and our loyal enforcers might just have the opening they need to clasp the fetters of servitude around their necks. It is not going to be popular with neither the bandits, nor with the populace, but it will be made clear that they have no choice in the matter."
KAT_define_territory:0 "Katerintreue Enforcers"
KAT_define_territory_desc:0 "Katerin is in a state of nigh anarchy in some areas, and the Katerintreue need more than just militias and Sheriffs to restore order. Carefully selected agents, loyal to the council and shying no means to carry out their commands, will be how Katerin is reborn, and the Katerintreue will make sure no one asks uncomfortable questions."
KAT_enforce_corvee:0 "Remind the Citizens of Their Duty"
KAT_enforce_corvee_desc:0 "As the enforcers of the Katerintreue now patrol the countryside, and the serfs have been reminded of the price of disobedience, the time has come to put them to work. Katerin is in shambles, and reconstructing it is a daunting task. If we are ever to turn the deadlands into profitable parcels of territory, then the serfs must be worked to the bone."
KAT_kat_march_railroad:0 "Katerinburg Railroad"
KAT_kat_march_railroad_desc:0 "Katerinburg, while being the capital of the principality, is a far cry from a modern city. The city itself is plagued with poverty and crime, and a proper railroad connecting it to the rest of the country was never realized, due to the dangers of the surrounding swamp. This state of affairs cannot be tolerated any longer, and the Katerintreue has ordered that rails be laid no matter how many serf lives it takes."
KAT_link_einfoort:0 "Link Lingermill"
KAT_link_einfoort_desc:0 "As the capital now possesses a functioning rail network, the prospect of linking Lingermill with the capital is now possible. A direct connection between Katerinburg and Andorstadt would cut down on many weeks of travel through treacherous countryside. Some may consider the working conditions needed to establish said rail connection to be dangerous, but such ideas are of no concern to us."
KAT_furstentumwerke_katalina:0 "Fürstentumwerke Diellza" #unused
KAT_furstentumwerke_katalina_desc:0 "Katerin is, to put it bluntly, an industrial backwater. The sheer chaos of the last few years drew away any foreign investment, and any griffon who possessed enough money to fund a factory would much rather spend said money on fleeing from Katerin than investing in it. But with the recent increase in tax revenues, the possibility of the government funding a few factories of its own has been brought up."
KAT_mines_of_andorstadt:0 "Mines of Andorstadt"
KAT_mines_of_andorstadt_desc:0 "Andorstadt is the largest city within Lingermill, and was once the seat of very profitable mines that supported the city's economy. Sadly, the chaos that engulfed the principality, coupled with labor shortages forced the mines to permanently close. But with the Katerintreue now establishing order, a plan using a few prisoners and serfs to reopen them under the authority of the Katerintreue has started."
KAT_trades_education:0 "Trades Education"
KAT_trades_education_desc:0 "The Katerintreue has finally managed to wretch enough control away from the princess to make a proper, if limited, system of education. Rather than the system that Diellza started, that is forcing griffons into a library to read books at random, an education system based around teaching young griffons valuable trades shall be adopted. This is by far the most popular action the Katerintreue has ever taken."
KAT_stahlfabrik_katerinburg:0 "Stahlfabrik Katerinburg"
KAT_stahlfabrik_katerinburg_desc:0 "The mines of Andorstadt now supply the capital with a steady source of iron, and the abundance of the material supplied by the mines has given the industrialists of the Katerintreue an idea. A steel works within the capital would be the most advanced building in the entire principality, and a drain on the treasury. But the long term advantages provided by such a building far outweigh the initial cost of constructing it."
KAT_steam_pump_land_reclaimation:0 "Mechanical Land Reclamation"
KAT_steam_pump_land_reclaimation_desc:0 "Thanks to the large increases in "tax" revenue the Katerintreue have brought to the principality, the purchase of several trucks, tractors and steam pumps to clear out more swamplands around the capital has begun. These machines will not only serve the purpose of expanding the amount of arable land around the capital, but for a larger push of industrialization across the country too. "
KAT_bribe_those_with_power:0 "Bribe Those in Power"
KAT_bribe_those_with_power_desc:0 "While the Katerintreue holds much sway over the laws of Katerin, it does not yet wield absolute power within the principality. The occasional noble lord still complains about the situation within the principality, with some even daring to write letters to the capital demanding action. With the new tax revenue, we can fix this."
KAT_loyal_gang_bosses:0 "Loyal Gang Bosses"
KAT_loyal_gang_bosses_desc:0 "While normally trusting the leader of a group of bandits is an unwise proposition, this situation in Katerin is far from normal. In particular, several of the gang bosses we have dealt with in the past have proven to be very agreeable to working for the government, especially when certain "incentives" are presented."
KAT_serfs_clear_marshes:0 "Restarting the Strass Industry"
KAT_serfs_clear_marshes_desc:0 "Under the Rule of Princess Diellza the Mad, What little industry was present in Katerin declined. The Strass industry in the Strassmark, once crucial in the old days as a Kingdom has remained so up until Diellza's reign and her inane orders and requests. This old heart of Katerin shall be re-organized and rejuvenated into its old glory, and it takes is a small push..."
KAT_increase_peonage_conscripts:0 "Increase Peonage Conscripts"
KAT_increase_peonage_conscripts_desc:0 "The current armed forces under the direct control of the Katerintreue are, to put it bluntly, pathetic. If we are to reclaim control of the countryside then our forces must be drastically expanded, and while former prisoners might not make for the best of soldiers, they do fill out the ranks quite nicely."
KAT_ganger_armies:0 "Punish Disloyalty"
KAT_ganger_armies_desc:0 "Although we have been tolerant of the excesses that our bandit allies are prone to take, the time has come to make it clear that their loyalty and competence is the only thing keeping them alive. Any bandit too ineffective or disloyal will be removed from the principality, permanently."
KAT_rough_diamonds:0 "Rough Diamonds"
KAT_rough_diamonds_desc:0 "The minor nobility of Katerin have spent years fighting and ruling in the countryside, and many of them possess a wealth of experience that utterly dwarfs the average peasant conscript. With enough training and a sense of discipline, perhaps these lordlings could be turned into something more effective."
KAT_investigate_knights:0 "Investigate the Knights"
KAT_investigate_knights_desc:0 "Thanks to the efforts of our agents within the knightly orders, we have gathered enough "evidence" of their "crimes" to start a public inquiry on their transgressions against Katerin and its citizens. As long as the trial goes well, the last opponents of the Katerintreue will be permanently crippled."
KAT_punish_disloyalty:0 "Ganger Armies"
KAT_punish_disloyalty_desc:0 "Even though they do have their peculiarities, it cannot be denied that the gangs now loyal to us are superior to the old peasant militias in nearly every aspect. The ganger units have proven so effective that the idea of phasing out the militias entirely and replacing them with gangs at a permanent basis might not be a bad one."
KAT_warlords_of_katerin:0 "The Warlords of Katerin"
KAT_warlords_of_katerin_desc:0 "As the final militias are replaced by their bandit counterparts, certain quirks within our ranks have made themselves clear. Although they may be battle hardened, rival gangs are more likely to fight each other than the enemy, and their leaders expect more autonomy than the old officers. Katerin has thus been divided between these warlords, with each gang leader effectively a vassal of the Katerintreue."
KAT_mercenaries:0 "Recruit Mercenaries"
KAT_mercenaries_desc:0 "Mercenaries have never been popular within Katerin's border, being considered little more than glorified bandits. In the current state of things though, they may be our best option. Rather glorified bandits than actual bandits."
KAT_mercenary_experience:0 "Knowledge From Wars Abroad"
KAT_mercenary_experience_desc:0 "The mercenaries we're employing have seen action across Griffonia, and their expertise is one that we are sorely lacking. Thankfully, there's no shortage of mercenaries who'd rather take the comfortable career or an advisor rather than a soldier."
KAT_self_initiative:0 "Officer Initiative"
KAT_self_initiative_desc:0 "One advantage with these mercenaries is the width of their aggregate experience, and if we are to rely on foreigners, we might as well make sure that we make the most of it. If we listen, we can boast an army that technically has fought from Vedina to Sicaemon."
KAT_grizzled_army:0 "New Tactics" 
KAT_grizzled_army_desc:0 "Mercenaries are expensive, and throwing them into battle like peasant militias will not only be wasteful, but it will lead to us losing their contracts. We must make sure to use these soldiers well: we paid a lot after all."
KAT_peasant_army:0 "Conscript More Peasants"
KAT_peasant_army_desc:0 "Katerin has always been a nation of warriors, even if recent times has undermined that spirit. It is time to crack the whip and levy the militias on a more permanent basis. It might not be a popular move, but it's a necessary one."
KAT_catch_up_on_guns:0 "Equipment Modernization"
KAT_catch_up_on_guns_desc:0 "Few, if any, peasant militias have equipment younger than the revolution. While this has served to limit the threat they could pose, it also makes them de facto useless. It is time to update the peasant arsenal."
KAT_peasant_production:0 "Efficient Gun Production"
KAT_peasant_production_desc:0 "The peasants don't need high-quality guns like those our knights use. They need something that can fire a bullet and can be carried around, and if we temper our expectations, we can arm our militias faster." 
KAT_army_of_all:0 "Streamlining the Militias"
KAT_army_of_all_desc:0 "It seems that every major institution in Katerin has some kind of militia to call upon, and any kind of unified chain of command is nigh impossible. We will have to restructure the militias from the ground up, putting them under one, unified command." 
KAT_army_consolidation:0 "Army Reorganization"
KAT_army_consolidation_desc:0 "While it has taken creative thinking and monumental efforts alike, we have finally managed to put Katerin's armed forces back together. While our troubles are far from dealt with, we at least have a proper army to face them with."
KAT_clean_the_ranks:0 "Clean the Ranks" #Unused
KAT_clean_the_ranks_desc:0 "As the bandits of Katerin are trained into a fully effective military force, it has become clear that their ranks are bloated with the lazy and the incompetent. These griffons have outlived their usefulness, and their former comrades are all too eager to clear out this rot in their ranks."
KAT_clean_house:0 "Clean House" #Unused
KAT_clean_house_desc:0 "With the best of the bandits now firmly loyal to the Katerintreue, we finally have the force of arms to remove our remaining enemies from the principality. The few surviving disloyal bandits, the nobles not already within the Katerintreue and any members of the court a bit too loyal to the princess, all will be dealt with in a permanent fashion."
KAT_block_resources_out_east:0 "Embargo the East" #Unused
KAT_block_resources_out_east_desc:0 "With the knights not meekly submitting to her as Diellza has hoped, her next course of action has been to order the entirety of east Katerin embargoed in order to squeeze the resistance out of the insolent knights, no matter the cost. It is a direct order, and nothing that the Katerintreue can refuse to obey... at least not yet."
KAT_a_test:0 "Weathering the Storm"
KAT_a_test_desc:0 "If Diellza hoped to break the knights, it seems that she is going to be sorely disappointed. Rather, news are coming from the east that the Silberkrallen and the Argentumdämmerung are joining ranks and standing united against her. Diellza raves and shrieks at the news, but the council can only smile. It seems they well and truly blame only her for this mess."
KAT_depose_katalina:0 "Depose Diellza"
KAT_depose_katalina_desc:0 "The time has come. Every single griffon with influence wants Princess Diellza gone, and the mad princess so deluded she thinks that she still controls the principality has far outlived her usefulness.

KAT_knightly_autonomy_desc:0 "The knightly orders were the sole authority keeping any semblance of order within Katerin for years, and as such, they have a great deal of experience in dealing with the peasants.

The Grovers are a quite... forceful lineage, and it would be a shame if the boy would end up spoiling the Herzlandtreue's plans.

However she was not impressed with the amenities of the Halls that had already existed. In response she had numerous Griffons pulled from across the Principality to tear down the oldest of them and construct a new grand hall. However, with little time to plan and complete the project, the concept had to be based on designs made years ago. While the laborers were worked for every single day with no rest until it was completed, lest the Principality face the wrath of Princess Diellza. By the end of it, numerous workers had vanished, been executed, or simply worked to death, but the Princess had her Ball."

katerin.9.d:0 "News rarely reach Katerin quickly, but this time it only took a week. A messenger made his way down the Griffking river and then through the marshy roads to reach Katerinburg and deliver the news in person to the Princess. He had been sent by Wingfried von Katerinburg, the Princess' cousin who was a member of the Knights of Hellquill and the infamous Reformisten. Pompously and proudly he told that her cousin was now the Grandmaster of Hellquill. However, Diellza seemed to care little, merely smiling a bit. But then it's as if she remembered something and said: "Oh, I almost forgot! I need to invite Wingfried to my wedding as well! Now he has a high enough rank to be a prestigious guest worthy of my husband."\n\nNo one really knew what wedding she was talking about, before she revealed her plans to marry Glitterhoof, a unicorn skull which Wingfried had gifted her years ago. She ordered the messenger to deliver an invitation to the wedding to Wingfried and that it would be held in a week."
katerin.9.a:0 "Well that was unexpected."

katerin.10.t:0 "An Invitation From Katerin"
katerin.10.d:0 "Soon after assuming power, Grandmaster Wingfried sent a messenger to Katerin, to inform his cousin Diellza von Katerinburg that he was now a mighty Grandmaster. However, when the envoy returned, he delivered a message that wasn't a congratulations like Wingfried had expected, but an invitation.\n\nPrincess Diellza was inviting him to her wedding with Glitterhoof, who would become the Prince of Katerin. At first, Wingfried didn't recognize the name, before remembering it was a unicorn skull Wingfried had gifted to Diellza several years ago. He knew that his cousin had grown oddly fond of the trophy, but now she wanted to marry it? Truly, she had gone completely insane like he had feared.\n\nThe messenger asked if he would accept the invitation. While Wingfried felt sympathy for his cousin, he also found it despicable that she would love the remains of a filthy pony so much. He hoped her cousin wouldn't be too upset if he said no..."

katerin.11.d:0 "As the messenger returned to Katerinburg his earlier conviction was gone, replaced with fear. As he appeared before Diellza he was afraid, indeed terrified, and the glee with which the princess received him did not help. Diellza was bouncing from excitement as she asked when "Wingy", her childish nickname for her cousin, would arrive for the wedding. When the messenger finally managed to give the news - that Wingfried was not going to show up - the glee vanished, being replaced with silent, mounting rage. Quickly excusing himself, the messenger rushed out in order to be out of range when the princess' disbelief was traded for rage. \n\nRetreating to her personal quarters, Diellza grabbed the nearest piece of decoration - a priceless crystal vase - and threw it into the wall with all her might. The explosive display of rage continued for hours as Diellza thrashed every last piece of decoration in her chambers as well as many pieces of furniture. None of the servants in the castle entered until well after the screaming and crying had stopped, and they found Diellza sitting on the floor, whining to herself as she rocked back and forth, clutching Glitterhoof close to her. Quietly, they listened to her whispers before retreating, choosing to spread what she had raved about on instead of daring to challenge her. All friendly ties to Hellquill was to be cut off, with any Hellquillians within the nation's borders being treated as persona non grata from now on. Also, the expected wedding between Glitterhoof and the Princess was postponed for the foreseeable future.\n\nIt was, after all, what the princess had commanded."

katerin.16.t:0 "The Alchemist returns to the Princess"
katerin.16.d:0 "Princess Diellza held court every single day to hear the pleas of her subjects, on paper that is. In reality the Princess' court, in the rare few days she decides to show up to it, is a strange and unnerving proceeding. Most of the nobles avoid making anything more than a token appearance at them, as any slight interaction with the Princess has the potential for a lethal result. There seems to be no rhyme or reason to her actions, and asking her to judge on anything was to invite disaster. To take a recent example, a griffon who had lost all of his belongings to bandits was sentenced to prison for not having protected his own property.\n\nOnly the truly desperate approached the mad princess when she presided over court, which made it all the stranger when a griffon fitting none of those descriptors approached her openly. The potion salesgriff hailed from Yale, and had operated within Katerin for a time many decades ago as the court alchemist for the Princess' father. The aged griffon carried with him a suitcase, and contained within were three vials which he hoped would, at the very least, soothe the princess for a while.\n\nThe alchemist proceeded to present the vials to the princess, and he made it clear to her that only one could be chosen, as mixing potions rarely had good results. Firstly, there was the vial that came from the north. It had the most brilliant aquamarine color the court had ever seen, and even still as the liquid was within the vial, strange patterns seemed to appear within the fluid if one looked at it long enough. \n\nThe next vial came from the south, concocted within the alchemist's laboratory within Angriver. The dark green liquid within seemed to move on its own, swirling around within the vial even when no outside force was acting upon it. The vial itself was hot to the touch, and it was clear that the liquid within was far from dormant, although the alchemist assured that it was safe to drink.\n\nLastly, there was the vial that hailed from the west. Unlike the others, the liquid within this vial seemed completely inert. It was completely clear, colorless and lacked any odor to speak of as well. No matter how long the vial was studied by the nobles, it seemed no different than normal drinking water. Perhaps that is what made it the most frightening of all the liquids to some. After all the liquids had been presented, the time had come for the Princess to choose which one she would drink."

This has apparently caused an uproar, with half of the vassals seceding from the Empire. Imperial authority was slowly falling apart, and whether Katerin liked it or not, it had quickly become clear to the Katerintreue council that they could no longer rely on the Empire. In silent discussion, the issue of telling Princess Diellza was soon raised. Her authority was still absolute, after all, and a servant soon headed for the princess' quarters to inform her.\n\nTen minutes later, as the servant's body was hanging from the gallows outside the palace for the crime of displeasing the princess, the news was already spreading among the people as well, leaving the already suffering people to fall even deeper into despair. Those few who had hoped that some day, at some point, the Emperor could have intervened against their mad ruler were forced to face the bleak truth.\n\nNo one was coming to save them now."

katerin.18.d:0 "Princess Diellza had been working hard the last few days, managing the principality was no easy task after all, and she had decided to take a day off from her duties to enjoy with her paramour Glitterhoof. The dining hall in the palace had been reserved for this occasion, and she had made sure to select only the very best delicacies for Glitterhoof. And with the preparations for the dinner complete, the time had come for her date with Glitterhoof to begin.\n\nThe hall itself was decorated in the most lavish manner possible, with colored banners adorning the walls, and portraits of Diellza's honored ancestors watching over the dining table. The appetizers of tonight's meal already adorned the table, as the palace's cooks had, on Diellza's orders, spared no expense in preparing for tonight's feast. The princess entered the dining hall, clothed in one of her more ostentatious dresses, and took her seat at the end of the table.\n\nAs she took her seat, she spotted Glitterhoof on the opposite end of the table. The skull was freshly polished for the occasion, and even had a rather expensive looking hat on. The princess started eating her meal and quickly decided to strike up a conversation with her date. "So how are you enjoying the feast Glitterhoof, I trust that everything is to your satisfaction?"\n\nThe Skull wasn't very talkative.\n\nThe lack of a reply from Glitterhoof did little to deter the Princess, who cheerfully continued to speak. "Oh my, I can see that you haven't even touched your portion of the meal, Don't worry dear, I'll make sure that the cooks are suitably punished for serving food that is so antithetical to your tastes."\n\nThe rest of the date went in much the same way, with the Princess having a seemingly infinite capacity to talk to the skull. The palace guard could do little but watch, and quietly inform the cooks that they best make themselves disappear before the meal is over."

katerin.19.d:0 "The invitations sent out for the ball had been at very short notice, but all the same the vast majority of the nobility had turned up. There were few safe reasons to ignore the princess, after all. Yet, at first it seemed that they were blessed with an evening of relative normality. The food was as lavish as it ever had been, the entertainment fine indeed and even Diellza seeming to be in one of her good moods, even if she had that skull close by at all times.\n\nAs the evening's entertainment was mentioned some of them noticed that Diellza had departed, and no one thought too much about it at first. As it turned out though, the entertainment was provided by the princess. Stepping onto the stage, she began to sing, accompanied by the string quartet next to the stage. She had a fine enough voice, few would question that, but the piece she sang was a duet and they saw no one else up on the stage with her. Unless one counted the skull of course, but surely she could not...\n\nOh Boreas...\n\nAs it turned out, she could. As Diellza's part ended she turned to look to her skull, holding it aloft to the crowd as silence settled over the entire hall except for the accompanying music that played through the second verse, with Diellza picking up at the third. If she was aware of the fact that she was performing in front of a mortified crowd of nobles that only wanted to sink through the floor and disappear she didn't show it, only carrying on through all eighteen of the verses."

katerin.20.d:0 "The princess had been sitting in the library for most of the day, devouring books as she was wont to do in her more peaceful moments. It had turned into a ritual for the castle, a few hours of guaranteed peace as their capricious ruler was off invested in the books of distant lands or strange mysteries that could absorb her so. Today, this peace was shattered though as Diellza came striding out of the library and summoning the guards, ordering them to bring "everyone" to the library "to enjoy it as well".\n\nThe pattern was all too familiar: the princess had gotten an idea and wanted it executed. Unless you wanted to be the one executed, you obeyed, and soon hundreds, indeed thousands, of griffons all around Katerinburg were marched from their homes into the great library. There they were told to "read" the books by armed guards.\n\nDiellza, standing on the second floor, oversaw the entire crazed affair, randomly pointing out griffons who seemed insufficiently overjoyed by her gesture of kindness and ordering them whipped. In the end, the few literate commoners around hurried to grab the nearest book, forming impromptu reading circles, with others clustering around them to listen, hoping that they could satisfy their insane ruler."

katerin.21.d:0 "Former Prelate Duskfeather has travelled Katerin and beyond during the years after he was deposed, and he has seen much all across both Katerin and indeed the empire. He has seen a nation slowly rotting from the inside out, not roused out of its stupor more than briefly when the revolution of 978 threatened to undo it, after which it sank back into its slumber. The emperor was useless, that much had stood clear to him, but even worse than that had been the pathetic state of the temples. Should they not have rallied to the people's side to help them? Should they not have encouraged the nobles to live up to the principles of the gods? Should they not have done anything other than continue playing power games in their palatial temples?!\n\nIt was then that he had come into contact with a griffon who had introduced him to the ideals of socialism. He could barely even remember the griffon's name, it had been a brief encounter. Mikhail something? Yet, the book he had given Duskfeather had felt like it tore away the veil from his eyes and let him see clearly for the first time ever.\n\nIt had been a long and trying walk to reconcile the radical preachings with his faith, but he had seen the truth in the end: Be they emperor or archon, there was never going to be peace for the common griff, the one that suffered more than anyone else, as long as the old order was in place. The archons were not absolved of their crimes, but rather even more guilty for their part in the suffering. The question was rather who was truly blameless in this situation."

Having gone from being a distant authority figure to the nearest thing the desperate griffons of Katerin had to a listening ear, he was like water to a parched throat for the countless griffons who had, for years and indeed decades, endured nothing but insanity and tyranny.\n\nHe spoke of things that would earn any regular griffon a place in the noose; of how the nobility were no more worthy than regular griffs, of how the injustices of the world could be overcome by the righteous and of how the people of Katerin were worthy in the eyes of the gods. He told them how to rise above the suffering they were living though and how to form their own local governments to let justice and law rule them, not capricious madness. Katerin's people could stand on their own four legs, he said, and they should do so if that was what it took. As in the distant land of Stalliongrad, where the ponies rose up to claim their own fate when their leaders forgot them, so could the griffons of Katerin assert their own power."

When the by then seven year old Diellza von Katerinburg was crowned, a regency council had been created to make sure that the affairs of state flowed smoothly, even though their legal ruler was a child. They had been advisors only, quickly reiterating their loyalty to the rightful princess, even as she slipped deeper and deeper into madness. They were loyal griffons after all, they were true. \n\nYet, true to what? Meeting under the cover of darkness, an assembly of the highest nobles of the land debated this question silently that night. They were still advisors and respected members of the principal council, but that wasn't enough any more. Diellza was only becoming more and more unpredictable and confused, and for the good of them all, it was time for them to take more direct control of the affairs of Katerin.

With each member of the council having great personal stake in the nation a deadlock has formed regarding where to focus their efforts. None on the council will accept having their estates plundered by robbers because the soldiers were focused elsewhere and the projects that hopefully could revitalize Katerin are in deadlock as everyone wants to to place said projects in their own domains.

Driven to sell their farms to the local nobles, they are now working the lands they used to own, keeping enough produce for themselves to survive. It has been sufficient for Katerin's needs, but the times are changing here too.\n\nWith the Katerintreue's plans to forcibly industrialize the nation one thing will be needed above all others: cheap labour. In order to effectivize the farming system and build a new industrial base, the sharecroppers must go. In order to make sure the abolishment of the system is carried out painlessly, we should increase the military presence at the estates."

They may not be wealthy, but they are many, and they are organizing themselves.\n\nIn addition to this, the Knightly Orders of Argentumdämmerung and the Silberkralle have each established firm power bases of their own across Katerin during these last years, and while the charitable Silberkralle have many differences with the militant Argentumdämmerung, there is plenty of reason to presume that they will gladly close ranks if threatened. Maybe even with the peasant revolutionaries?\n\nTo address this issue, August Gottschalk has proposed a simple solution: to begin courting those who might aid us and offer them to join the Katerintreue. It is risky, but the Katerintreue's position is too weak to get picky about allies."

katerin.29.d:0 "Katerin stands at a crossroad that may very well determine its future. Deposing Diellza was not the solution to our problems as some might have hoped. Instead, the nation is only fracturing more and more. Sharing power with the other factions has not mollified them, instead it has only invigorated them as they see a route to actual power, and the Katerintreue's legitimacy has been broken by turning on their supposed monarch.\n\nDuskfeather's peasant revolutionaries are gathering steam by the day, and the Knights have made it all but clear that they are no longer interested in playing nice. Everything is falling apart.\n\nThe council has one chance to address this to escape safely, as the errant factions are still somewhat willing to discuss. Chaos may still be avoided, but whatever action the Council takes will need to be decisive, as it will shape Katerin's future utterly."  
katerin.29.a:0 "Contact the former Prelate, we need the peasants now more than ever."
katerin.29.b:0 "Get a hold of the Knights, These are our final hours."
katerin.29.c:0 "We are Katerin's true champions! We will never yield!"

katerin.30.t:0 "Arming the People"
katerin.30.d:0 "A people under arms will not be so easily cast into tyranny, and we ought to make sure that the common griffs can defend themselves. Across Katerin, griffons are being taught to fight and to organize themselves, and we turn away no one who wishes to learn and who can display a genuine desire to fight in this army of the people. Critics of Heinrich Duskfeather's plan has claimed it will give up government control of the people, missing the fact that this is precisely what he wants to achieve. The people do not need knights or soldiers to shield them, not when they have the skill and the weapons to defend themselves on their own."
katerin.30.a:0 ""Be not helpless cattle, but warriors in your own right!""

katerin.31.t:0 "Mass for Everygriff"
katerin.31.d:0 "More and more, the once sparsely attended masses throughout Katerin have become fixtures of life both in the countryside and in the cities. Nowadays, the temples are not just places to hear the words of the gods, but the first channel through which government information reaches the people as well as place of learning and healing.\n\nThe priests are no longer to be mere preachers, but they will be counselors to the grieving, arbitrators between neighbors and teachers to the children as well. Merely reciting platitudes from a book will no longer earn them the honored title of priest, anygriff shall soon be able to read, but a true guardian of his flock shall be the glue holding the community together when all else fails, and he will do so through earned trust and respect."
katerin.31.a:0 "Alms for the poor and needy, help for the sick, care for the downtrodden."

katerin.52.t:0 "The Solution to the Bandit Issue"
katerin.52.d:0 "Diellza von Katerinburg had summoned the council before her. The tone of the message and the rapidiness with which it happened implied she was having a lucid moment, which could bode both well and ill, something the councilmembers all knew too well.\n\nAs they entered Diellza met them seated in her throne, that skull of hers resting in her lap and with a look of schooled calm on her face, which only made them even more nervous. \n\n"I have called you here to speak on the matter of the banditry that is plaguing our nation." She said regally. "Our armed forces are spread thin, and the longer we struggle with this, the weaker our grip becomes on the nation. I have therefore issued a decree, effective from this day, to solve this issue. As of today, the bandits plaguing our nation are drafted into the service of Katerin as tax collectors and soldiers. As long as they pay their dues to the crown, their activities can continue as they are, and our soldiers can be freed for other, more pressing matters."\n\nThe chambers fell silent, with no one speaking up before the Minister of Justice, whose eyes had been bulging out of his head, slowly keeled to the side, landing on the floor with his eyes rolled into the back of his head." 
katerin.52.a:0 "Boreas... Arcturius... anyone... help..."

katerin.53.t:0 "An all too Expected Outcome"
katerin.53.d:0 "The news of the princess' "brilliant" solution spread across Katerin like wildfire. Maybe apologists could have said that it was an attempt at diplomacy and to build unity, or that she was the princess so surely she knew best, but the bandits disproved the notion rapidly. As the soldiers, by royal decree, retreated from their bandit hunting missions, the various bandit groups used the opportunity well, launching a campaign of terror and theft across most of Katerin. Villages now burn in the night and hundreds, if not thousands, have seen the open invitation in the princess' declaration and taken to banditry as well. Whatever headway done thus far is gone, and the bandit issue is worse than ever before."
katerin.53.a:0 "Months of efforts wasted..."

katerin.54.t:0 "A Visit from the old Prelate"
katerin.54.d:0 "The gates outside the castle was seething with people as a crowd of peasants were loudly protesting outside. The line of soldiers in front of it would have opened fire, were it not for the presence of the former Prelate of Katerin. The ex-prelate, Heinrich Duskfeather, stood between the soldiers and the crowd, clutching his walking staff as he glared them down, stopping any of the soldiers from even dreaming of actually firing their guns.\n\n"Who among you hold authority?!" he demanded of the guards, "Where is your captain?!" He stood firm, reiterating the question until the royal guard captain came out from behind the line, ordering him to disperse the crowd. "You claim no authority over me, or the people of Katerin, other than what we indulge you to have, whelp!" Duskfeather snapped in response, leaving the entire line of soldiers to actually shiver in fear.\n\n"Unless madness has spread through the castle, your masters are still sane enough to understand their actions! They may cower behind their fragile claims to authority, but the gods see! The gods see and the gods WILL judge them, as will the people if they push hard enough! Woe unto your masters, for those who play with fire will get burned. Unless your cowardice is as absolute as your masters, tell them this. The people are watching, and the people will not suffer this much longer!""
katerin.54.a:0 "Why was he not dealt with before he became this influential?"

katerin.55.t:0 "Katerintreue Industrialists in Strathburg"
katerin.55.d:0 "Strathburg was a town in the middle of a painful and sudden transformation. Industrialists connected to the Katerintreue had shown up only a couple of weeks ago, with armed griffons, and they had papers from the government that gave them right to seize the properties of several of the townsfolk to clear space for their new factory. Tensions were running high throughout the towns, with more than one group of peasants having gotten into fights with the guards before being scattered by the soldiers.\n\nFrom atop the chapterhouse, Grandmaster Erik Grimclaw stared down at the scene as it was playing out. He sneered in silent contempt as the industrialists, griffons invited from Flowena or Skyfall, came and drove honest Katerin griffons from their homes by force. The law was on their side, but Grimclaw wasn't naive enough to think that this would solve any of the problems that the Katerintreue were whipping up. Already he could tell that this wouldn't stop with fistfights and turned to one of his knights, ordering him to rally every available knight in the chapterhouse. It seemed the Argentumdämmerung would have to calm things, and also remind those agents of the Katerintreue that they were not as invincible as they thought." 
katerin.55.a:0 "Maintain order and protect the people."

katerin.56.t:0 "Connected At Last!"
katerin.56.d:0 "Lingermill, in the furthest corner of Katerin, has been isolated even compared to the rest of the nation. Only the Silberkrallen have historically shown much interest in the region, even placing their chapterhouse there to better guard the southern flank of Katerin. Yet, not even Lingermill has escaped the changes in the nation as of late. The new road that has been built from Katerinburg to Andorstadt has opened up the region for development, and already prospectors and surveyors have been coming to the area.\n\nGrandmaster Hector Ardennson sat by the new bridge, watching the griffons that were arriving in greater and greater numbers with every passing day. It should be cause for celebration, certainly, but considering the state of Katerin, he couldn't help but worry. This road had robbed the locals of the distance they had had to Katerinburg, and now that was torn away from them and opened them up to the iron claw of tyranny. Staying trapped in the past was no way to live, yet right now he could only worry over what he could only see as a danger to many of the griffons of this region, griffons he had come to see as kin."
katerin.56.a:0 "Must progress come with such tyranny?"

katerin.57.t:0 "Morale Crumbles!"
katerin.57.d:0 "The solution to the griffpower shortage, press-ganging criminals and convicts into service, has run into problems. Without any infrastructure in place to truly keep them in line, all that has been achieved has been chaos. On one claw our loyal soldiers are disgusted by having to serve alongside all manner of unsavoury scum, and on the other claw said scum is taking any chance they can to run away or break discipline. While the numbers are looking better, the discipline is worse than ever before."
katerin.57.a:0 "The Commissars will whip them into shape."

katerin.58.t:0 "The Investigation"
katerin.58.d:0 "By order of her highness, Diellza von Katerinburg, the knightly orders of the Silberkrallen and the Argentumdämmerung stand accused of working against the crown. Their chapter houses in Katerinburg have been closed down and the knights arrested, with all loyal citizens of Katerin being ordered to assist the crown as it investigates these claims. Despite the urging of her advisors and the Katerintreue, the princess was utterly unwilling to show any consideration for the sensitive political situation and has brute-forced the issue.\n\nAs it has turned out though, whatever she hoped to achieve has not come to pass. Instead, most of east Katerin has rather rallied to the knightly orders' side. With little royal authority remaining in both Strassmark and Lingerbill, the Knights are all that the people there have to rely on, and they are sticking by their saviors' side."
katerin.58.a:0 "And so the situation escalates..."

katerin.59.t:0 "The Embargo"
katerin.59.d:0 "Furious at the insolence of the knights, Diellza has ordered the council to "punish them". Walking a fine line between disobedience and causing a civil war, the Katerintreue have presented a comprehensive program before the princess to Embargo the east and strange any deliveries of goods, be it food, weapons or medicine, to the east. With the Argentumdämmerung and the Silberkrallen both choked, it is hoped that they will bow their heads and be more malleable to the royal will and also that it will placate Diellza enough to not send the army after them."
katerin.59.a:0 "We play with fire... let's hope we are not burned."

katerin.60.t:0 "The Test for the Knights"
katerin.60.d:0 "While the two orders stand united in purpose, their methods and their beliefs differ on many key areas. The Silberkrallen were in part formed to act as healers and guardians of the sick, and they take their commitment to the weak very seriously. Meanwhile, the Argentumdämmerung splintered off from the Hellquill order, and have never lost their militant edge. Tensions run rife between the orders and the Katerintreue knows this well. \n\nUsing contacts and plants among the knights as well as buying off local bandit gangs, the Katerintreue have begun whipping the east into a frenzy, hoping to overwhelm the orders and cause enough tension for them to break apart. Already, arguments have broken out between the knights and in one case a Silberkralle physically blocked the Argentumdämmerung from executing a captured bandit.\n\nIn response, the grandmasters have decided to, for now, unite the orders. They must have one doctrine and one commander, not two, and yet the issue of which and who have kept this from happening already. As things are going though, a decision must be reached. After days of debating, the choice has been made."
katerin.60.a:0 "Hector Ardennson will take charge in the quest to heal Katerin."
katerin.60.b:0 "Erik Grimclaw will restore law and order, by force if needed!"

katerin.61.t:0 "Unity in the Orders"
katerin.61.d:0 "The Silberkrallen and the Argentumdämmerung had decided to meet at one of the former's local chapterhouses, a large, two-story house that had been converted to a hospital for the locals. It had taken some time after the Argentumdämmerung's arrival for the Grandmaster of the Silberkrallen to appear though. Yet, when one of the Argentumdämmerung knights had left the room where they stayed to drag the Silberkrallen's leader to the meeting he had found Hector Ardennson in the middle of surgery and been cooly informed that if he entered the disinfected area Hector would not hesitate to slay him on the spot.\n\nAfter an hour, as Hector entered the meeting room, he bowed his head to Erik Grimclaw, his equal among the Argentumdämmerung. "Master Grimclaw, it is good to see you again. Also, my apologies for the threat levelled against your subordinate."\n\n"Normally I would demand satisfaction, but there are greater issues to deal with right now. I will not beat around the bush: that madgriff in Katerinburg and her sycophants will be the death of us. You know this, do you not?" he asked, Hector sighing in response.\n\n"I know... just one more of the countless ills plaguing this nation, and this one there is no balm for. I believe I know what you are imagining, but I would like to hear it from you all the same."\n\n"I am not fond of you, nor are you fond of me. Your knights consider mine bloodthirsty barbarians, and we consider you naive and weak-willed, but Katerin needs all the champions it can get. Grandmaster Ardennson, I, Erik Grimclaw of the Argentumdämmerung, offer to stand by you as an ally and as a brother. For Katerin, I will be the sword and you will be the shield. Let our differences strengthen us in this struggle ahead."\n\n"Grandmaster Grimclaw, I, Hector Ardennson of the Silberkrallen, accept your offer. Let your knights undo the villains who would threaten the people and let mine bring solace to the suffering." The two grandmasters shook claws, knowing well that their foremost duty was not to pride, but to Katerin."
katerin.61.a:0 "United we stand, divided we fall"

katerin.62.t:0 "A United Katerin"
katerin.62.d:0 "As the sun rose over the city, Katerin stood as one. From the former Prelate and the people who support him, to the knightly orders of Katerin and indeed even the Katerintreue, they all had come together. The gates of the palace were not battered down, but opened, and the steps up to the main keep was not contested by guards, instead they were the ones opening the doors.\n\nThe limit had been reached for all of them, and on this day the reign of the mad princess was finally ended. Not a single shot was fired, nor was any blood spilled, as there was no one willing to stand on Diellza von Katerinburg's side in this moment, and as the palace guards broke past the barricaded door into her room, it was to arrest her on the spot.\n\nAs it turned out, it would not be so easy for the revolutionaries. The princess was gone, as was Glitterhoof, and a window swayed slowly open in the wind. For the first time in decades the mad princess had actually left the castle, abandoning it to the revolution. While search parties are heading out to track her down, Katerin is still freed from her madness, today and hopefully forever."
katerin.62.a:0 "The Madness has Ended."

katerin.63.t:0 "The Hunt is On"
katerin.63.d:0 "With news of Diellza being sighted close to the Griffonian border, the new regime has redoubled their efforts to find her. Local militias have begun guarding the border and griffhunters have been sent out to scour the woods. Somewhere out there, the mad princess is still lurking, and unless all that Katerin has achieved is going to fall apart then she must be tracked down." 
katerin.63.a:0 "Scour the region and leave no rock unturned!"

katerin.64.t:0 "The Fate of the Mad Princess"
katerin.64.d:0 "The knight entered the chamber and saluted his grandmaster before giving the news that they all had been waiting for. Diellza had been captured alive, if exhausted, and was being transported to the castle. A sigh of relief went through the chamber, with all the present griffons visibly relaxing. The topic soon came up of what punishment would be issued, with many favoring the death penalty for the tyrant. It was at this point that Hector Ardennson stood up, scanning the crowd before shaking his head.\n\n"Is that not an easy solution?" he asked the crowd. "Cut her head off, think that the matter is settled and move on as we invest all our sins in her, leaving nothing for ourselves." His words caused a stir, with one of the representatives asking him what he was trying to imply. "I am implying that we are prepared to murder someone for convenience, not justice. How many people have Diellza killed? Wrong, the answer is none. She has not killed a single griffon. Every last victim of her terror was murdered by soldiers, agents and loyalists. They were the ones who carried out her bloody madness."\n\n"Let me also stop those among you who are going to cower behind the witless excuse of her being the legal authority. A fine authority that was too; a six year old broken girl, forced onto the throne to lead instead of being given time and aid to heal from the loss of everyone she ever loved. You, Sheriff of Katerinburg, did you not murder dozens on her orders? When a desperate, traumatized child lashed out at the world, did you not close your eyes and heart, claiming you were innocent because you just followed orders? What of you, general? Or what of the Katerintreue? And if so, are we not all innocent? She was the legal authority of all, and does not then every last griffon of Katerin carry no responsibility for the pain and misery wrought? Has for all these years Diellza been the sole griffon in Katerin with the ability to make her own choices and to bear the consequences?"\n\n"I think not. We carry blame as well, in various amounts, but we are speaking of moving on. Of not seeking to extract brutal justice, but offer a new beginning in which old grievances are left behind. If we are serious about that, then that applies to her as well. We are not going to allow her to rule in any way, shape or form again, let that much be clearly stated. Rather, she will be institutionalized and given what healing we can give. Whatever happens though, we are NOT going to murder the broken griffoness who was shoved onto the throne and then meekly indulged through an ocean of blood because we were all too terrified to consider any alterative!""
katerin.64.a:0 "We are better than her, we have to be."

katerin.65.t:0 "The Lucid Princess"
katerin.65.d:0 "The knight was staring down at the sight before him, having imagined the end of this by now weeks long hunt in many different ways, but this option had eluded his fantasies. Diellza von Katerinburg lay at his feet, her legs trapped and from what he could tell broken under the fallen tree. She was still breathing, only barely, as she weakly clutched that skull of hers to her chest. Grabbing his radio and calling the others to him, he watched her slowly turn to look at him\n\n"Are you from the palace?" her voice was weak and cracked, as if she had screamed for hours.\n\n"I am, and you are going back to be judged" the knight answered atonally.\n\n"I understand...  It is only right..." after a few seconds a strange sound came from Diellza, one that made the knight look up at her. It was a sob. "I'm sorry..." she said, tears trailing down the sides of her face, "So much death... I'm so sorry... You're one of the Argentumdämmerung... aren't you?"\n\n"I am..." the knight said, unable to muster much more in the way of a reply. He didn't recognize the mad princess at all. He had worked in the palace for years, but nothing like this had ever shown itself in her.\n\n"Please...kill me," Diellza whispered "They should have killed me back then. Then I wouldn't have lived in this... haze... for so long... I survived... only to make everyone else suffer. Please..." she begged, tears flowing slowly down her face as she stared up at the sky. "Kill me... I want to die while I am still me..." she begged, clutching Glitterhoof close to her chest."
katerin.65.a:0 ""I gave her peace, sir, and I stand by what I did.""

katerin.66.t:0 "Running the quarry down"
katerin.66.d:0 "Diellza had been dashing madly through the woods for hours, her clothes tattered and holding Glitterhoof to her chest as she flew, even as her wings burned from exhaustion. It was animal panic that drove her and every sound from behind her only further inflamed it. All she knew, in her terrified, near mindless, state, was that she had to flee, she had to get away, they couldn't capture her!\n\nYet, the masked griffhunters that followed her were as fast, if not faster, and they split up as they drew nearer to their quarry. One of them kept up the wild chase and turned to the left to overtake her and drive her to the right. Readying the rope, he could almost feel the gusts of wind from her wingbeats as he drew nearer and nearer, and when his colleague tackled her from the side, having rushed ahead to hide, he was on her in an instant.\n\nDiellza gasped wordlessly as the air was knocked out of her lungs and she crashed onto the forest floor with a loud thud. Glitterhoof rolled away from her into the underbrush, and before she could do anything the three griffhunters were all on her, gagging her and binding her claws and wings so they pushed against each other to immobilize her. She tried to struggle, weak cries of fear and desperation escaping the gag, but the masked griffs paid her no mind as one of them lifted her onto his back to drag her back to Katerin and the awaiting council."  
katerin.66.a:0 "She goes nowhere, not while we still have use for her."

katerin.67.t:0 "Reaping what was Sown"
katerin.67.d:0 "Heinrich Duskfeather stood silent, looking up at the sight before him and trying to keep himself steady. It would not do for the griffon who had been entrusted with Katerin's future to lose his composure easily... and yet by the gods he struggled in this moment.\n\nHe found himself remembering an old memory, a dreadful memory that he had long wanted to leave in the past. He remembered a young girl barely six years of age, standing in from of him in a bloodied dress and with something broken in her eyes. Though he had pitied and sought to aid her for years, there had never been enough time. The darkness in her had only grown and in the end it had consumed her, leaving her a bloodthirsty madgriff. In the end he had made a choice: trying to continue reaching out to her, or fight for those who suffered under her tyranny. He had chosen the latter, and thrown himself into it with all he had. No more hesitation, only action. No more compromise, only righteous fury.\n\nHe held quietly onto this ideal as he looked up at Diellza's broken body where it hung from the noose, slowly swaying from the branch above. Below her, the skull that she had cradled so obsessively lay shattered to pieces. He slowly looked around himself, meeting the eyes of one farmgriff after another, seeing how none of them could bring themselves to meet his eyes.\n\n"The villain will incur his debt to the gods, and they claim it with interest." His voice carried across the subdued mob. "But woe betide him who interferes with divine justice, for he carries the gold of his soul in a flimsy purse. You slew her not in a court of justice, but mad rage. Begone, and pray for Boreas to give you the perspicacity you lacked today."\n\nSilently, the mob that had all but torn their hated ex-monarch to pieces dispersed, leaving only the old prelate to stand there, watching the swaying corpse in front of him before lowering head and finally allowing his feelings of shame and disgust to well up inside him. Action and rightous fury he had called it, but all he saw here was blind rage."
katerin.67.a:0 "Boreas forgive me... forgive us all..."

katerin.68.t:0 "The Broken Bird"
katerin.68.d:0 "If there was one thing that Hector had always despised, it was when the ill were shunted to the side and left to rot in buildings that were more like prisons than houses of healing. He was convinced that a certain level of comfort - physical and spiritual - was a vital part of recovery, and therefore he had demanded that the mental asylum which would house among others Diellza von Katerinburg looked less like a fortress of damnation and more like a place of comfort.\n\nThe place might have high walls, barred windows and steel nets covering any aerial escape routes, but it also had a garden surrounding it, with the nets above being wreathed in vines. The halls were wide, the rooms had actual decorations and comforts, however slight, and there was a library as well as several common rooms. It was a strange place to be sure, as was the unicorn doctor walking next to him, but he nevertheless felt reassured by both.\n\n"Are there any plans for using leucotomy to deal with her condition?" he asked the doctor. "From what I've understood, many surgeons swear by it."\n\n"It seems Equestrian and Griffonian medical training is quite different," Doctor Solace - one of the best psychiatrists in Herzland and a pony of Equestrian descent - remarked. "We try to be careful with surgery where none is strictly needed, and there's still so much we don't know about the brain that I cannot advise operating on it."\n\n"I will defer to your judgement, obviously," Hector conceded. It was true that he hadn't had time to follow the latest medical findings as well as he had wanted to. "Do you believe she can be healed?"\n\n"That I cannot say. From what you are describing her traumas have been allowed to fester for decades, and the way she was indulged seems, frankly, beyond irresponsible. Right now she is very hostile, even violent at times, because she's been taught the world should dance to her tune and that there are no consequences. If you will forgive me for saying this: she caused much harm to Katerin, but Katerin hurt her badly as well." Hector could only sigh in response."\n\n"You are right, I just hope she follows Katerin in healing as well.""
katerin.68.a:0 "Time will tell."

katerin.69.t:0 "A Long Path Before Us"
katerin.69.d:0 "Diellza glared at the unicorn in front of her from where she sat. It was a plain chair, but she sat with as much of a regal bearing that the soft hospital clothes afforded her. Glitterhoof sat placed in her lap and Diellza ran one claw over the crown of her beloved as she addressed this insolent foreigner. \n\n"You will hang," she told him lowly. "I don't know who you think you are to take these liberties, but you will hang like the rest of all traitors!" her voice slowly grew to a hiss and yet the pony only smiled.\n\n"Then I will accept my fate," he said calmly. "May I sit down?" he continued, and Diellza sneered.\n\n"You may not! Leave!" she snarled at him and the pony remained standing, even if he bowed his head apologetically.\n\n"I will leave as soon as I can," he promised her. "I just need to know some things and I will leave you alone."\n\n"Get out. Get out, get out, get out!" Diellza hissed, "Guards! Kill him kill him kill hhiimmm!" The hiss turned into a scream and when nogriff assisted her she threw herself at the pony, the rage that surged in her too potent to leave anything inside of her but a desire to hurt the creature in front of her. Yet, all she struck was a glowing energy barrier and she shrieked, thrashing and clawing at it as the pony backed out of the room and closed it, leaving her to take out her rage on the room around her instead."
katerin.69.a:0 "There's a long way to go."

katerin.70.t:0 "Little By Little"
katerin.70.d:0 "When Doctor Solace came into his office he was soaking wet, with little pieces of boiled vegetables clinging to his coat, yet he smiled all the same. Hector - fresh from the parliament - raised both eyebrows at the sight.\n\n"Ah, mister president," Doctor Solace said with a chipper tone. "I have very good news! In case you wonder what this is, miss von Katerinburg chose to throw her dinner at me today. I didn't expect things to go this well this fast!"\n\n"I... am unsure how you draw that conclusion," Hector found himself perplexed by the pony's reaction. That sounded like about as bad a reaction as he could have hoped for.\n\n"She's a griffon," Doctor Solace elaborated as he got out of his coat and washed himself in the sink. "She has a beak and claws and she has used them before when I enrage her. Until now, I've had to have my strongest barrier ready in case she lashes out in blind rage. This however? This is petulant anger - a conscious reaction, not a primal one as before. She sees me as a hateful twit daring to give her orders, but she responds to it... well immaturely, but still as a thinking person. I even managed to have a brief conversation with her before she threw it at me."\n\n"I understand..." Hector found himself humbled. "I confess I seem to have hoped that with proper treatment she would recover relatively swiftly. I apologize."" 
katerin.70.a:0 ""We will have to be patient.""

katerin.71.t:0 "Finally Sinking In"
katerin.71.d:0 "Diellza was restless, pacing back and forth in her room. She didn't like this, she didn't like it at all! That damn Solace and his questions and therapies and his pills! They all left her feeling different and she didn't like it! It was as though they were picking at something in her skull. She was Diellza von Katerinburg! Rightful princess of Katerin! He pricked at her again and again with his questions and his pills but she was the one who ruled the land! She was the one who decided who lived and died! She! Not him! Nogriff else! She was the one with power! She wasn't helpless!\n\nHer heart was racing and she felt how she trembled again. Like thousands of times before she reached out for Glitterhoof, her only comfort. He chased away the fears and with him she was strong, even here. She had him and she didn't need anygriff else. Yet as she touched him she found herself freezing. What was... Slowly, she turned to see what was wrong and when she saw it she let out a scream, a terrified, animal scream of despair and denial.\n\nThe screams echoed even out in the corridor, leaving the orderlies to break into a full sprint towards her room and burst inside, seeing Diellza in a corner, clutching her face and screaming. An aged nurse came in as well, taking Glitterhoof from his position at the table and approaching Diellza, trying to offer him to her, but Diellza only lashed out in panic, flailing.\n\n"Get it away from me!" she screeched, raising her claw to try to slash at the nurse to get her to back off right before the orderly blocked her and restrained her. As Doctor Solace came rushing in as well, Diellza was struggling against the two griffs with the panicked strength of a madgriff. With no option but to sedate her before she hurt herself, the doctor cursed to himself.\n\nAbout ten minutes later he came back to his office, holding Glitterhoof in one hoof and placing the skull on the desk. Looking down at the thing that had been with her for so long he felt a sting of pity. Sometimes delusions broke slowly... sometimes violently."
katerin.71.a:0 "Thank you for your service, Glitterhoof."

katerin.72.t:0 "Lost in The Darkness"
katerin.72.d:0 "The hallways were empty and silent, leaving only the soft clacking of Diellza's claw as she roamed through them. Her other claw was wrapped around her and she stared into the ground, her chest in short, harried breaths. She couldn't stay in her room, she couldn't stay still, the images in her head were too much. With the only comfort she'd ever known turning out to be false, all she could do was stare into the gaping maw of reality.\n\nShe couldn't run, no matter where she tried to focus her mind more images were searing through them in an endless parade of horrors. Servants and peasants and knights and even children, beaten and whipped and hanged and murdered and burned.... Turning into one of the unlit hallways, she whined despondently, stopping to lean against the wall, clutching her head as the darkness surrounded her.\n\n"Boreas please... anygriff please," she whimpered, begging that she could go away, that the walls of her being could dissolve and she would vanish into the blackness where she belonged, where nogriff would ever find her, but the gods didn't listen. No one listened, no one saw her, no one loved her, no one needed her. Before her mind's eye the tainted specks of blood - the specks that had been there ever since that day - danced over her dress, spreading all over her until she became nothing but blood and death, a thing from Maar's deepest pits. What was she? What had she done? How long? How much?\n\n"Diellza?" the voice cut through the darkness and she startled in both fear as relief as Doctor Solace came walking through the darkness of the corridor, his horn lit by a gentle spark of magical light. Realizing she lay curled up on the floor, she did her best to scramble to her feet as he came up by her side, kneeling. "Come Diellza, you can't be out here. You'll get cold. Let's get you back to your room and get you some tea," he whispered, urging her up to her feet, but Diellza couldn't move as she was shaking too much. Clutching onto his coat, she didn't dare to even say what she wanted, only managing to force out a couple of choked gasps.\n\nAgain, he urged her to come with her and this time something broke inside her and she threw herself at him, desperately holding onto him like she was drowning. She tried to speak but could only spit out incoherent sobs as he slowly returned the embrace, silently comforting her as best as he could."

Still, the coziness didn't seem to do much for the poor griff who sat in one corner of her bed, curled up and staring into the distance.\n\n"Diellza?" Doctor Solace said, "You have a guest. Can he sit down? Do you feel well enough to talk to him?" Diellza didn't reply verbally, instead slowly nodding after a few seconds. Hector slowly sat down, unsure what to do and therefore acted much like he would around a terrified animal: calm movements and a gentle tone.\n\n"Are you being treated well?" he asked her, mainly to try to show he was not hostile. "How are they treating you?"\n\n"Are... are you a republican?" she asked him, Hector hesitating. Republican... like that crazed mob who had slaughtered her family. He glanced at the doctor, who shook his head.\n\n"I'm not going to hurt you Diellza," he assured her. "I only want to know if you are doing okay."\n\n"Why didn't they kill me?" she asked, her whisper a near gasp. "I don't want to be here, I don't want to be here, why didn't they kill me?"\n\n"I brought you a gift," Hector said, noticing how the doctor nodded eagerly at him trying to distract her. Taking out the small package he carried, he placed it on the bedside table. "It's a book series, and it's just gotten popular in the country. I thought you might like them."\n\n"That's a nice gift, isn't it?" The doctor coaxed her gently and Diellza looked briefly at the package before turning away again. In the end, Hector rose to leave and the Doctor followed him out. "She will read it," he assured Hector as the door closed behind them. "But she will do so when she's left alone." Hector, meanwhile, looked back at the door with a sad sigh."

katerin.74.d:0 ""When are you throwing me out?" Diellza asked out of the blue one day during one of her two weekly sessions with Doctor Solace. The doctor in question looked at her, seeming as though he was confused by her question.\n\n"What do you mean?" he asked Diellza. She was sitting in the chair with her shoulders pulled up and the same downcast look on her face, one claw scratching at the armrest of the chair.\n\n"You're not keeping me here forever, are you?" Diellza reiterated her point. "You'll throw me out in the end. Or are you doing all this just so I'll know that I'm locked up forever?"\n\n"It's... true that you'll be let out in the end," Doctor Solace assured her. "But we're not "throwing you out". When you leave here we will make sure you have somewhere to go."\n\n"And where's that?" Diellza scoffed bitterly. "Katerin? I can go there so they'll finish what they started back then? Not that I didn't earn it..." she trailed off and Doctor Solace grimaced to himself. Not a good direction to head in.\n\n"That would be a very silly thing for us to do," he said. "I'd like to think that our efforts would pay off a little more. Speaking of payoff, did you finish those books you got? How were they?"\n\n"They were fine..." Diellza said reluctantly, wrapping her arms around her. "Never read pony books before."\n\n"What was missing in them?"\n\n"The main character and her antagonist were so obviously right for each other," Diellza elaborated. "It didn't make sense that they didn't get together. I think the author is in denial. Next book better fix that."\n\n"Well you're in luck," Doctor Solace informed her with a smile.

She shied away from others unless she had to interact with them, kept to herself and could be outright unpleasant if you didn't put the books back exactly where you took them. Still, she knew the library inside and out, and if you were knew your manners, she could help you find anything. For most of the students she was a fixture of the library, one that hurt no one and made life easier for all of them.\n\nAs for Adalia: she was content. She didn't know if she was happy, she still struggled to understand what "happy" even meant. She still had nightmares, and she still needed medicine. If the few friends she had didn't visit, she tended to forget to care about herself, and she struggled to interact with others beyond them. And yet... she felt safe, at least mostly. She had a café close to her home that she used to go to when she finished work at eight o' clock. They had a grapefruit cake that she always ordered before going home, and the cat there liked to come lie in her lap. She earned enough money that she could save and buy all of the major newspapers.\n\nSitting at the kitchen table in her small apartment, Adalia calmly cut out the photo out of the newspaper, flipping her scrapbook to Z, for Zebrica. Gently, she lifted the photo and placed it in the middle of the page, right where she had painted the glue, before making doubly sure that it was perfectly straight. Clasping her claws together, she looked at the image of the Saddle Arabian palace, smiling to herself. She wasn't Diellza any more, she was Adalia. She had a life, one that she didn't want to give up. She had her books and her job, and that was enough for her, but she could still dream of these distant lands and all the adventures that could happen there. It had always given her comfort, and it'd continue to do so. She didn't need more.\n\nThis was something that made her happy, that much she knew."

Finally, sanity has returned.\n\nOthers are not just feeling hope though, but are sensing an opportunity. The Council rules for now, but will they have what it takes to hold onto power?  Even more importantly, do they have the right? Duskfeather, the once Prelate of Katerin, does not think so, and none has earned more loyalty from the peasants than him. The Knightly orders of the Silberkrallen and the Argentumdämmerung stand equally suspicious of the council's intentions. Did they simply trade the mad princess for a bickering group of powermongers?

Hector Ardennsson had pondered the challenges facing the nation for years and again and again he had reached the same conclusions: the woes of the nation were the result of leaders that could not be removed, even at the worst of times, and no matter how you cut it, it seemed the nobles would always have cause to keep the peasantry down.\n\nThese had been thoughts that he had kept close to himself, yet in the wake of the fall of Diellza he had chosen to act quickly, writing a letter to an old friend that he had not spoken with for decades, yet who was the best bet he had for ensuring that the future of Katerin was one that benefitted the people as well as the nobles. As the friend was smuggled into Katerinburg, Hector met him in the doorway with a smile.\n\n"It has been too long my friend. Let's get you a meal after the road and we can talk. How was your journey here?"\n\n"A pain," the old griffon answered, "there's a lot of borders between here and Cloudbury. Tell me what you are planning while I'm eating.

Ever since then the Grimclaws have remembered this slight.\n\nNow, an ancient wrong is set to be righted. While there is much left to do, there has not been a time in all these centuries that the throne of Katerin was so close, and Erik Grimclaw has lived with the weight of his family's old humiliation on his back since he first understood the slight done to them.

Pulling the skull further back, the griffon only waited. "We can throw him away. Hide him where no one can see him. Sign the dotted line, and you will have him."\n\nSo it continued for the rest of the day, the ice cold interrogator never losing his patience or changing his tone.

All she could care about was Glitterhoof and when he was given to her she clutched him close to her, sobbing.\n\nWith the princess' claim to the throne officially signed away in perpetuity to the Katerintreue council, the interrogator left the cell to give the paper over to the awaiting agent outside.

This should take the worst edge off the starvation that Katerin faces.\n\nThere's also quite a few prisoners across Katerin, be they bandits or political rivals. Instead of carrying out executions in the capital only, the Katerintreue have decided to carry out the executions publicly and in the nearest major settlement, all so that the people can see the decisive action taken to protect them.

The once proud walls of the keep have been in a state of perpetual disrepair for the last 20 years, doing little to discourage any potential attacker. The city itself has grown far beyond the boundary of the walls, with villagers fleeing from bandits and the plague taking refuge in an ever-expanding network of tents and shanties.  The city is in ruins, all that remains is its decaying cadaver, and the vultures have come to feast.\n\nWith the constant stream of refugees to the city, it was inevitable, the plague has come to Einfoort. If the city, and more importantly its inhabitants are to be saved, then decisive action must be taken.\n\nWhen news of the plague arrived at the capital, the knightly orders of Katerin stood ready to secure the city at a moment's notice. The orders have served the principality with an upright zeal for centuries, dedicated to upholding a tradition of chivalry that stretches back hundreds of years. Two major orders have established themselves within the Principality, and both have volunteered for the task.\n\nFirstly, there is the venerable order of the Silberkralle, led by the honorable Grandmaster Hector Ardennson.  The Silberkralle acts as the sword and the shield of the common griffon, striving to make the life of the peasants as comfortable as possible given the circumstances. The Silberkralle desires to calmly and carefully take control of the city, minimizing the danger to the common folk and granting those too sick to survive a merciful and peaceful end.\n\nThe other knightly order of Katerin, the Argentumdämmerung has also volunteered for the task. Led by the fervent Grandmaster Erik Grimclaw, the foremost objective of the Argentumdämmerung is to pull the plague out by its roots, and reclaiming the deadlands of Katerin for the Empire. What they lack in experience they make up for in zeal, and they seek to drag the plague from the city as quickly as is possible, minimizing the risk of infection for the populace.\n\nOf course, the Orders could always be dismissed and Einfoorts garrison given the task of restoring order, but the garrison was already small and poorly maintained before the plague hit, and there is no telling what methods they might resort to."

The order was quick to officially relieve the beleaguered garrison of the city, who were immensely pleased that the city was now someone else's problem.\n\nA curfew was shortly enforced across the city, with the Silberkralle restoring order to the streets with efficiency, yet not without compassion. The Silberkralle have been understanding but firm, seeking to separate the diseased from the healthy and allow them to live out their final days in peace. The citizens of Einfoort were undoubtedly put at ease due to these efforts, there was a deeper meaning to them.\n\nThe Silberkralle carries with it a secret objective, they seek to establish the exact cause behind the infection, and the mysterious plague that Katerin has suffered for so long.

But they were resigned to their bloody task for if they did not carry it out, then who would? The knights would do whatever needed to be done but they would take no pleasure from it.\n\nThe Grandmaster of the Argentumdämmerung himself, Erik Grimclaw, was leading them. He was not one to shy away from such a challenge, and he would not dream of making his loyal knights carry alone the burden of such a task. The Grimclaws could trace their ancestry all the way back to the founding of Katerin itself, and although they had lost control of the principality, the last scion of the Grimclaws still wielded great influence within his homeland.\n\nThe knights quickly took the reins off the garrison and moved to secure every quarter of the city. Every single house was to be searched for any trace of the infection, and those of the sick deemed to be beyond saving were granted a merciful end at the claws of the knights. Einfoort would be cleansed, nevermind the cost."

katerin.139.d:0 "When the Garrison was given the ultimate responsibility of restoring order within Einfoort, many of its denizens were relieved. Fearing that the zealotry of the Orders would only serve to increase the damage and that entrusting such a task to the garrison of the city would result in the least amount of damage to the city. But none could predict what methods the garrison would resort to, the means by which they would purify the city of the diseased. \n\nThe problems started only a few days after the garrison was given the task, when food shortages combined with a fear of the plague caused a panic amongst the peasants. The garrison found itself overwhelmed and was ultimately forced to retreat within the crumbling walls of the keep while the riot burnt itself out. This incident was clearly the last straw for the garrison, who perceived their position as untenable. Fearing for their lives and becoming ever more paranoid of the plague, the garrison took the only option that made sense to them.\n\nThey burnt the city to the ground. Gathering the remaining oil and torches contained within the keep, the garrison proceeded to methodically walk through the city, setting everything they encountered ablaze, and killing all those who resisted. \n\nThe plague is gone, and Einfoort along with it. All that remains of the city are burnt ruins, and whatever poor wretches who managed to escape the blaze."

katerin.141.d:0 "It had been a few days since the Argentumdämmerung had arrived in Einfoort and the situation had been strenuous since. The members of the Inner Circle present met in their tent outside the city to discuss the situation. Among them stood the young Grandmaster Erik Grimclaw. Barely older than a fledgling, he stood out amongst his elders. But he embodied the idea that in souls nobly born, valour does not depend upon age. Next to him sat Eggert Von Strathburg and Gunter Drakkenwald, the two highest ranking knights of the Inner Circle. Von Strathburg had conducted the first actions in the city and his face was still veiled by grief over the death of several of his subordinates. Gunter had arrived only the day before at the head of the relief force but still managed to make himself unwelcome by criticizing the infirmaries set up by Von Strathburg's griffs.\n\nThe knights opened their meeting by a prayer. After, Grimclaw gave the floor to Eggert. He proceeded to paint a bleak portrait of the situation. He reminded the Circle of some of the atrocities his knights witnessed in the city from some of their inhabitants. In his eyes, Einfoort was virtually lost and needed to be treated not as a city to relief but as a target to tackle with brute force. To save Einfoort would require to save it not only from the plague but from itself. Several knights banged the table in approval and Grimclaw himself seemed to agree with Von Strathburg but Gunter asked to speak. The Grandmaster allowed him.\n\n"Brothers and sisters, Grandmaster. There is no question about the valour of our knights and their sacrifices in Einfoort. Yet, I fear that we have wrongly took our Grandmaster's call for crusade too literally. One does not tackle a plague city like a rebellious uprising. We need to care for these griffons and act with a cool head."\n\nEggert scoffed at the remark "How dare you, brother? If you had indeed showed up in time, we might not be in the situation we are in." Gunter glared back at the griff. "Tread carefully, Eggert. If you think boasts of brashness will grant you authority, let me remind you we are not tavern drunks listening to stories." Eggert put his claws on the table and rose up. "I will not take insults lightly from a coward!"\n\nGrimclaw rose his claw and demanded silence "Enough." Gunter and Eggert obeyed and sat down. "My father had absolute trust in your valour and competence. This much I know. So remember your oaths. Both sides have merit and we must stand together because...""

katerin.142.d:0 "As the news of Einfoort's ultimate fate spreads around Katerin, panic enveloped the populace. The government had never held the best interests of the lower classes in mind, but the griffons had never imagined that it would perpetrate such a blatant atrocity against its own citizens. The common griffon had already known that the military would do little to protect them against bandits, but now every single garrison was a collection of murderers and madmen. Protests over the bonfire of Einfoort erupted in the major cities of Katerin, and those protests soon erupted into riots, ones that had to be dispersed by force.\n\nThe citizens of Katerin now flook to anyone who promises to save them from the claws of their government, with both of the Knightly Orders have received a large boost in applications to join. But not every griffon can count on the protection of the knights, limited in griffonpower as they are. For these poor wretches, there is nothing to protect them if the nearest garrison were to turn on them. They yearn for something to protect them from the abuses thrust upon them by their government and grow more radical by the day."

Indeed, at several points volunteer knights walked into the most plague-ridden city blocks to stay with the people there, soothe their worries and convince them to stay together, care for each other and not spread the disease any further. \n\nWhile many knights caught the plague themselves, and many of those knights died, the Silberkralle's devotion, medical knowledge and tireless efforts has stopped the plague from spreading beyond Einfoort. As the situation stabilizes, the Silberkralle have been preparing to depart again, leaving only a small group of knights behind to keep an eye out for any additional outbursts of plague. As Grandmaster Ardennson put it, disease was just another enemy to fight for the people, and their duty is done."

Equipped with whatever tools available and gauze masks or protected by cloth dipped in vinegar, they began to clear the streets of whatever blocked them. Corpses were taken away to be burnt. Trash and boulders from various ruins were cleared. The infected people were brought to the dispensaries and homeless relocated to relief camps around the city to restore some semblance of order. Then pumps brought by the knights or salvaged from the local firefighters' barracks were set up and slowly but surely, the streets began to be cleaned by the civilians under the protection of the knights. Fountains, wells and other water sources were either rigorously scrubbed or condemned. The task had not been an easy one and many of the workers fell ill themselves, despite the protections.\n\nWith the way now cleared, the knights set about establishing various outposts throughout the cities. The city's squalor was far from purged but at least, they could now venture into the streets in a normal way."

This time, in force and with a clear objective cutting a way into the city. This was no easy task. The roads of Einfoort had become a mess of rubbles, abandoned carts, garbage and even corpses left to rot.\n\nFollowing a map drawn up by Gunter Drakkenwald, they got to work to clear the streets along specific lines. The peasants would gather all obstacles and burn them. In some places, buildings would be torn down to allow for easier and safer passage. As for the homeless, they were rounded up and led to quarantined areas outside the city. The plan was to create a network to allow the Argentumdämmerung to move quickly in the city, control the movements of the population and institute a curfew. These new roads into Einfoort were quickly nicknamed the Sacred Way.\n\nAfter the knights were finally able to move unhindered once more, they spread the word to the population: the city was now under curfew. All those found in the streets during curfew would be considered rebels and shot at."

Volunteer knights walked into the most plague-ridden city blocks to stay with the people there, soothe their worries and convince them to stay together, care for each other and not spread the disease any further. Others lived in their gas masks for days and yet others quickly isolated themselves when signs of the plague appeared\n\nThe plague is slowly receding, but the Silberkralle have paid for this victory with dozens of knights' lives, and they depart Einfoort a diminished chapter. Yet even as they do so, there are no signs of bitterness or resentment among their ranks, rather instead the knights have come out of it seemingly strengthened in their conviction, and the people are noticing this selfless sacrifice as well.

The most infected parts of the city were coinciding with the more unruly parts of the city, which, according to the locals weren't even the old bad neighborhoods. Worse, some witnesses. While Eggert and Gunter were arguing about the value of their respective information's, Grandmaster Grimclaw pounced on it with the confidence of youth.

Instead of tools, the buildings were full of strange substances, notably a strangle white-ish powder. One knight who grew up in a butcher's family noticed how oddly close it was to bone meal. Documents were seized, written in a foreign language that nogriff seemed to recognize at first glance. And most ominously, they found crates of relief food, with markings from the temples of Eyr, the princely authorities or, even more worryingly, the knightly orders themselves.\n\nThe findings were put under the surveillance of selected knights unanimously trusted by the Inner Circle and all involved in the search were sworn to secrecy.

They knew that to call what they had over Einfoort control was overly optimistic and that it could easily be reverted. Some parts of the city were lost to the plague and unrest or were simply about to collapse or burn down, possibly taking entire blocks with them. They needed to take radical actions.\n\nThe knights had begun to mark down the situation of the city in the streets by painting symbols in Argentumdämmerung code over the doors and at the entrance of the streets. They also had at their disposals some maps that the scholars under Gunter had drawn up. Eggert then devised a plan and presented it to Erik who heartily agreed. He too felt that difficult measures had to be taken.\n\nOver the next few days, knights were ordered to begin to evacuate buildings and areas that were deemed too dangerous to be left alone. To prevent any delay, the knights were order to break in and order the immediate departure of the inhabitants. Those that did not would be forced out and put under quarantine.

So much still remained shrouded in mystery but one thing was certain a group was hard at work, corrupting and defacing Einfoort and Katerin. For what purpose but pure maliciousness? That, they were not yet sure. Neither was what they had to do next.\n\nErik had tried his best to unite his knights but despite his popularity, he just couldn't get his griffs to see eye to eye. He had forced Gunter and Eggert to work together but they had only radicalized as things went forward. Gunter was still convinced that Einfoort could still be saved. That what they needed to do was simply to go in and cut off the head of the salamander. He had some support. The strange happenings had brought some of the more experienced knights to his side. Eggert, on the other claw, had grown increasingly frustrated to see so little progress, so many half-measures to save a city that didn't seem to even want to be saved. Einfoort had resisted. Knights had fallen to petty criminals during evening patrols and civilians were routinely showing disobedience to orders. Einfoort had taken its toll on the Argentumdämmerung and Eggert was determined to put an end to all of it. And he was strongly supported.\n\nErik knew that if he continued to try and balance the two, the credit his knights were giving him thanks to his birth would eventually run out.

No, instead he had taken his time, repeatedly, over the weeks that had passed, to devote a little time here and there to talk with the child.\n\nWhile Grover had treated him coldly, the boy was at least impeccably polite and had answered when given a gentle push. What more, as Duskfeather had chosen to not be threatening, but simply let it take time, he had managed to get a glimpse of the boy's sharp mind. Also, the boy was surprisingly pure-hearted, only wanting to "help people" as he had called it.\n\nFor these reasons and several others, Duskfeather arranged for the boy to be made an acolyte in the temples.

They occupied an unique position, it seemed. The faithful saw in the revolution a threat to an artificial hierarchy they were insistent the gods had withdrew, and the revolutionaries were so obsessed with the temporal that they could only imagine the divine as shackles.\n\nIt saddened him to see how those he would gladly have called comrades believed him some deranged preacher that corrupted the revolution for his own end. What end? He lived humbly as he always had, built no statues of himself and while he carried a symbolic title, he was merely a teacher to the people. Certain things were unavoidable, and just like how capitalist societies in the end built themselves towards oppression, the gods were the final arbiters of right and wrong.\n\nIn socialism, the griffons had found the closest thing to a morally pure society where the gods' message would not be corrupted by powerbrokers. He had realized this slowly, and painfully, and he wished that those who fought for the common griffon saw that as well.

Remembering what had happened with her and how her limp, battered body had swayed in the noose, left a stab of shame pierce through him even now. Whatever excuses he could pull up felt hollow, they still had ended with death and blood.\n\nAnd much death and blood had he wrought since? Once, merely armed conflict had bothered him, now he casually declared wars. He stood on a precipice to becoming a monster, and he had to pull back from the edge and remember why he fought.

The standoff continued for a good while, with the guards prepared to die to the last to protect their young ward as long as they could, but finally Grover was spirited to a safe location along with the governess.\n\nThe Grandmaster has made it clear throughout the government that the boy is not to be touched and any attempts against him, for whatever reason, will be dealt with swiftly and decisively. Whatever he was meant to become, right now he is a child who will struggle to cast off the imperial legacy he was born into, and as we have taken much from him, it is only right that we give him something he never could have had before: a choice in life."

Though individuals are different, actions and not birth is what sets them apart. These ideals are not something we compromise with: they are ironclad and unyielding, no matter what winds may blow. How much pain has not been caused because the Empire was built on blood, making ambition something necessarily blood-soaked if one wanted to reach beyond one's birth in life?\n\nNo more though, from now on, our people will be free to pursue prosperity and happiness freely instead of being told to know their place. It is a great change, but it is one long overdue."

Rather, I wish to speak to you all today to give you my deepest and my most heartfelt thanks. Our world has convulsed in these last years, and what little familiar comfort we knew has been broken time and time again. Few could fault those who resigned themselves to their fate in times such as these.\n\nYet from the swamps of Katerin, to the great streets of Griffenheim, the erudite halls of Yale and the depths of the Scheißwald, one thing has stood clear for the all world to see. No matter how dark the night has become, the griffons of these lands are not broken, nor are they simply resigned to their fate. I see not cowed peasants, but a people with the strength and the dignity to rise up, again and again if has to be, to fight for what they believe in.\n\nI will not be here for long, maybe even in the next election the people will choose against me, and I will gladly step down then, for I have seen the measure of those I can now call fellow citizens. I know, in the depths of my heart, that what I was one of the first to start building will continue to be built by my countrymen. So thank you, once more, for your efforts and your accomplishments. I rest easy knowing I have countrygriffs like you on my side.""

Grandmaster Erik Grimclaw knows that the world needs order, and in a time of strong wills and scheming plotters there is only one way  to end the strife that will follow: Strength and Justice. How many would want to style themselves emperor in these times? Tens, maybe hundreds even. They are not going to be meekly subdued with words, but by blood and iron. Yet, when all enemies are crushed, what will remain behind is a terrified and bleeding people, whipped to war for all these would-be emperors, and they will need to be shown - without any reservation - the safety and justice a true Emperor can provide."

The Herzland griffons always were the core of the empire, and they are the one attached to it. Let the Vedinans have Vedina, the Aquileians Aquileia, the Wingbardians Wingbardy.

Grover stuttered, trying to repeat the lines he had been taught but stumbling over the words. \n\n"Are you?" Erik asked. "I sit in front of you, your empire fallen before my armies, your regent gone and so is your claim to the throne. What 'right' do you have?" Grover, still but a child, found nothing to say even as the words stung him. After a while his beak began to slowly quiver, tears welling up in his eyes. Erik watched the boy impassively\n\n"I am not going to hurt you," Erik told the child, pitying the little chick. "I know you'll hate me, but all I've done is avenge my family, and I don't hate you. One day, Boreas willing, you will understand."\n\nAs Grover was taken away by his governess, Erik looked after him in silence. His grudge was against the empire, not this child, and it seemed this had landed him in a situation where his ancestor's enemy's descendant was under his protection. Chivalry gave you options for dealing with your adult enemies for good, but a child? No, children were sacred, and it seemed he would have to keep a close eye on this little boy from now on."

His servants had tried to spirit him away but they had been intercepted, and with the Katerintreue currently thrust into the spotlight, this was just what they needed. \n\nAfter all... the boy emperor needed advisors, would he not? Advisors and teachers. Their council had formed to advise and guide the young Diellza, and though her madness had made her... unruly, the Grover lineage was not given to such derangement. And considering that they already had learned much from how to play that deranged griffon...\n\nMaybe it was time for the Katerintreue to prove their... loyalty... to more than just Katerin? \n\nThe boy's servants and friends would need to "disappear", preferably in a way that hurt the boy and left him feeling betrayed and vulnerable. New servants would be needed, servants loyal to them, and who better to become his new teachers than they, the loyal servants of the empire, only looking to protect the boy and make sure that he was raised... properly?"

Under their guidance, these former Katerintreue shall safeguard Herzland and keep order. For this reason, they are officially declaring themselves the Herzlandtreue, and will serve as the regents of this state.\n\nAll loyal griffins are called upon to do their duty to the state and are reminded that disobedience is treason. Certain new taxes will be levied to ensure the splendor of Griffenheim and the Imperial Palace - now hosting the regency council - is not diminished in order to show the glory of the Empire, and the Herzlandtreue are convinced that the loyal griffons of the land will not shirk from this duty either."

Who was to say that THEY would be the ones to forget? After all, there were documents back in Katerin that were uncomfortable for them in their current situation. They were the powerbrokers of the Herzland and, by extension, most of Griffonia, but that put them under scrutiny of a kind they had not faced before. Maybe certain griffons would disapprove of how Diellza had been handled, or raise questions about how the national tax revenue was distributed.\n\nThankfully, there were enough loyal griffons available to them that as they had the archives quietly sealed and taken away to be burned, few raised any issues. Griffons needed to vanish too, there were too many out there who knew things. The Argentumdämmerung and Silberkralle were all but irrelevant these days, but that didn't mean they were harmless so they had to go. The same went for Heinrich Duskfeather, and to make doubly sure their bodies needed to vanish too.\n\nAlso, with their agents busy throughout the Herzland clearing out any evidence of their previous actions, the council had all the time it needed to assemble a second force that would, no question asked, hunt down the first set of agents after they were done.

It was organized by, and for, the esteemed members of the Herzlandtreue, to thank themselves for the sacrifice they made day-to-day in order to save both Katerin and the Empire; a task they managed to successfully fulfill without as much as a word of acknowledgment from anygriff. One had to be able to congratulate oneself sometimes, and the good folks from Katerin took it upon themselves to live up to their standards.\n\nThe palace was sumptuous, the cherubs on the ceilings were decorated with gold leaves imported from Bronzehill. It reflected its shimmer upon the grand orchestra playing the old anthems. In the center of the room, a giant ice swan was slowly melting. Griffons weren't even paying attention to it though, they were too busy adjusting their robes. The theme of the soiree was "Famous Griffons and their attributes", so of course, everygriff came in dressed as themselves; a practical joke they all quite enjoyed.\n\nThe delicious food was abundantly displayed on large tables or carried on trays by lesser nobles. "At least they get the imponderable honor to be present!" a griffon laughed. The circle around him joined in the hilarity. "Well, they can marvel at this fine reception. It's probably the only time they'll have the honor. Better them than... The poor." A chick gasped in the assembly. "The mere thought... Have you heard, it seems they gathered at the gates. Do you suppose they want something?". The distinguished guests laughed again."

A significant percentage of the people are going to become reliant on the food dole, meaning that being able to eat is quite literally in the government's claws if they want to eat. Of course, they are actually able to eat, so the whining out in the factories about higher wages will lose momentum.\n\nAdditionally, with a "consolidation" of various pesky food standards, the foods being sold in these stores can be adulterated at the producer's discretion, allowing for a nice little profit margin that can go into the Herzlandtreue's pockets. Food for the people, lower wages for the industrialists and a well deserved reward for the wise Herzlandtreue."

They crushed the Katernii armies at Marethon, they slew Grover II and they have ever since fought against the knights of Hellquill and Longsword. What more, during his investigation into his family's history, Erik Grimclaw uncovered something curious. After Marethon, there was never any declaration of peace between the Katernii and the Riverlanders. They are still at war, and through this revelation, Grimclaw has a casus belli against the east, if he would take it.\n\nThe question is, of course, why. Though some around him have compared the Katernii defeat to the conquest by the Grovers, Grimclaw knows there is a key difference at play here. Grover I defeated his ancestors through deceit and treason. This supposed warrior king was too scared to fight the Katernii and instead showed himself willing to curry the favor of traitors. The Riverlanders, however, fought the Katernii honestly and bravely. Fighting like true heroes, they held Marethon and utterly destroyed their opponent. In skill, strength and courage they both had been tested, and though countless died, not a single one could be called cowardly after that battle.\n\nThe west has challenges aplenty, and charging into the riverlands on some fool's errand would take him from honoring his family's legacy to making him a clown who rode on ancient history to justify his need for glory. Indeed, perhaps it would be prudent to send a missive to the east and let the Riverlanders know that the master of the Herzland want to make sure that this by now centuries old war is finally put to rest?"

The Arcturian priest that carried out the ritual was an old and trusted aquaintance of Grimclaw, and the temple was an old place in the depths of the Lostgate mountains. It all was a lot of effort, but as he sat in the front row of the ceremony, he thought to himself that Alexander Kemerskai deserved it.\n\nHe was conflicted on the old revolutionary. While he had no tolerance for the anarchy of republicanism and popular rule, he was not ignorant enough that he thought of Kemerskai as a simple traitor. Knowing the state the empire had been in back then, revolts were to be expected. Kemerskai had simply been more successful and persevered longer than anygriff else. He had fought to the bitter end, dying with a gun in claw despite his advanced age, and if you ignored his ideology, he was a griffon that Grimclaw could only respect.\n\nAs the ceremony ended, Erik approached the old lady in the corner, bowing his head deeply to her. "My condolences, for whatever they are worth" he told Kemerskai's widow, who stood looking at the casket. Her eyes held tears, but the look in them did not merely hold grief. She seemed angry, resentful, and he found himself wondering at who it was aimed. He had taken her husband from her, and yet... their intelligence had indicated Alexander had been committed to the point where nothing remained but duty. Erik wondered if Alexander had been a good husband, or if duty had swallowed him whole.\n\nTurning away and walking out of the temple, Erik looked up at the stars above. For a brief moment, he felt sudden kinship with the old revolutionary. Duty demanded all, and left nothing for the one called to serve. All died, yet what was the reward for this duty? Grief for those you abandoned? There was a lesson here, one he would muse on for a long time."

This age would not be one of wanton imperialism, ruled over by a distant nobility more interested in its own entertainments than their god-given duties, nor ruled by republican madness that would throw down all that they held dear.\n\nGoing forth, the nobility's positions would no longer be exlusive and tied to blood, but instead merit would decree who were given influence in the nation. Those griffons who have dutifully served the nation would be given the title of "citizen", and with this they would gain several privileges, including the right to cast votes for who would earn a position in the Feathisian-style parliament that would be tasked with advising the king from now on. Those able griffons who had been stuck as mere servants in the old system could rest assured that their talents no longer would be squandered, and the nobility across the nation had his guarantee that their station would never be threatened as long as they proved themselves worthy of it.\n\nThis age - Erik Grimclaw has stated - is an age of merit and duty.

Normally, Erik would not have indulged some old griffon who wanted to meet him personally, but Rudolph Thorbeak had a long enough list of accomplishments that Erik did not feel it was justified to simply deny him. Yet, the request the old griffon had was presumptious to say the least.\n\n"Explain yourself old griff, for what you are saying suggests I should let this nation fall to republican anarchy. I know of your sympathies, but I would have thought you would be less overt than this."\n\n"My beliefs should not be a secret to you," Thorbeak admitted freely. His voice was quivering with age, and his claws shook, but though he spoke slowly, he was steady. "yet my concern is straightforward: the people have drunk from the cup of liberty, and this cannot be undone. Let us leave notions of moral judgment aside, and focus on the facts in front of us. Absolutism will to them be simple tyranny that must be fought. They are no longer content with simple servitude, and this is a force to be either harnessed or quashed no matter the cost."\n\n"And I presume the only sane cause of action is to invite the common griff to the table, and let him rule alongside those the gods chose to lead our society?" Grimclaw asked. "Dispense of the rhetorical tricks, what you speak of is to meekly surrender in the face of adversity."\n\n"Have you not spoken of rallying the full capacity of the Herzland?" Thorbeak replied, his old eyes locking onto Grimclaw. "All should serve and do so to the utmost of their ability, is that not your creed? For whatever reason, is it not possible to imagine that the proper course of action for the nation could be found among those not noble-born? After all, have not the Argentumdämmerung recruited freely among whoever have the proper mettle? If the values espoused by your order are sincerely held, should not the people be listened to, at least?"\n\n"You are a snake, Thorbeak," Grimclaw told the old griffon. "Is this how you broke Gerlach? You took what mattered to him and framed your issue so that if he disagreed, he would be immoral and hypocritical?"\n\n"If you are the griffon you have claimed to be, then that is an irrelevant question," Thorbeak retorted, making Grimclaw lean back in his chair, clasping his claws together as a smile crossed his face."

### Leader descriptions ###
kat_crazy_chick_desc:0 "As one of the last surviving members of the von Katerinburg family, Princess Diellza carries a legacy 300 years old. Her family was among the first who pledged allegiance to the Grover dynasty and for their loyalty they were rewarded the principality of Katerin. During Diellza's childhood, however, tragedy befell the family during the revolution that struck the empire. A mob stormed the von Katerinburg castle, seeking to overthrow the princely family. When the smoke cleared, the six year old Diellza was the only one still alive, even as she was imprisoned by the revolutionaries.\n\nAfter the revolution ended and Diellza was freed something had broken inside the girl. As the only remaining von Katerinburg, she was raised to the throne as Princess of Katerin, even as the trauma she had experienced began to manifest itself.\n\nEver since, Diellza had been quietly referred to as "the mad princess" as her mannerisms have become more and more erratic and violent. Nowadays her subjects live in constant fear of triggering a violent outburst from her, and though she goes from relatively lucid to enraged madness regularly, it is impossible to predict when and what does it.\n\nOne of the few things that seem to have a stabilizing influence on her is "Glitterhoof", a pony's skull that was given to her as a macabre gift from her distant cousin Wingfried von Katerinburg. Whatever the intent behind the gift was, Diellza always carries it with her, treating "him" like a stuffed animal and referring to the skull as her fiance. This, combined with her unpredictable and violent mannerisms has made her feared and hated among a people that once respected the von Katerinburg lineage, and it is doubtful if Diellza is able to comprehend this."
kat_uthor_desc:0 "As the Grandmaster of the Silberkralle, Hector Ardennson is a knight and physician in equal measure and is held in high regard by most in the country. Born in Strassmark in 945, Hector had just become a knight when the revolution swept the empire, Katerin included. While he fought on the counterrevolutionaries' side, the many atrocities he witnessed and the longstanding suffering of the people left him disillusioned with the old order, and even as he was part in restoring the nobles' power, he began to question the old hierarchies. At least the republicans spoke of the people's suffering, and at least they tried to relieve it.\n\nEver since, Hector worked tirelessly across Katerin, trying to help the suffering people and mitigate the worst of Diellza's excesses, but in the end that wasn't enough, and he found himself forced to act more directly for the sake of the people he swore so long ago to safeguard and help."
kat_arthas_desc:0 "Erik Grimclaw is a descendant of heroes and kings both. In his veins flows the blood of those mighty warrior kings who held sway in the south of Herzland long before the empire even was a thing. Still, the Grimclaws have for a long time been a relic of the past, and it is only with Erik that the family's fortunes has begun to change. Under his lead, the once fading Argentumdämmerung has revitalized into a fighting force equal to any order in the Empire, and this is despite his young age. While stern to the point of harsh and with little patience for failure, Grimclaw has earned the respect of most around him for his military acumen and ironclad principles. One might not find him pleasant, but no one can call him unreliable.\n\nYet, he is also keenly aware of how Katerin has fallen, and he is determined to restore it one way or another. He is not one to lightly consider defying those he serve, but this land is his by ancient right and was taken from him through treason. Though it was centuries ago, he has neither forgotten nor forgiven."
kat_crazy_old_bird_desc:0 "Once one of the preeminent prelates of the Temple of Boreas, Heinrich Duskfeather could well have carried him all the way to the position of Archon. Yet, inside the temple hierarchy as much as outside of it, the political games played are vicious, and Heinrich underestimated his rival, the prelate that would become Eros VII. Losing not only the struggle for the Archon's seat, but his position as a prelate as well, he was left destitute and banished from the temples as Eros made sure to not just defeat but crush his opposition.\n\nIt was at this time, during his darkest moments, that he met a certain griffon during a train trip, one that gave him a book on socialist philosophy at the end of it. The disillusioned and destitute ex-prelate was captivated by the ideas discussed in it and started to slowly reevaluate many ideals he had held.\n\nIn the end, when he returned to Katerin, he had concluded that the very structure of the temples meant that the kind of power games that had seen his downfall were not simply a part of the temple hierarchy, but rather a cancer that is rotting the temples from within, just like how the nobility is a cancer upon the people.\n\nDrifting through Katerin, he preached not from a grand altar, but at the kitchen tables and at the marketplaces of the common griffon, seeing the suffering that the nobility wrought upon the people and how the temples didn't fight this suffering as much as teach the people how to accept it.\n\nIt sickens him, and he has long since realized that this order must be torn down, by force if no other option is available."
kat_mean_council_desc:0 "The Katerintreue council was born out of the various influential noblegriffs who after the revolution acted as regents for the six year old Diellza von Katerinburg. Power, however, is an addictive thing, and after Diellza reached adulthood these griffons didn't simply step down. They remained as "advisors" and "aides" the princess, even as they slowly began to weave a complex web of laws, deals and legal judgements to entrench themselves more and more. While Diellza was still the sovereign of the nation, they slowly became the ones who held the actual power.\n\nThere is little in the way of ideological foundation or greater goals within the Katerintreue. Instead, power is everything to them, indeed it is their birthright as the greatest minds Katerin can produce. Within the council, those who lose their grip on power will be discarded and those who stumble will be used by others. Griffons join and fall out of favour with the Katerintreue constantly, and the only reason that the Katerintreue has not collapsed into infighting is this very balance of terror between the various members. No single member can threaten the balance without being turned upon by the rest of them, and for unscruplous power-mongers like the Katerintreue there is no reason to challenge the system as it is. Why would they, when it enrichens them so?"

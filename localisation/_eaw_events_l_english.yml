The Lancaster’s pilot, Lightning Dust, when asked for a comment on how she felt once dropping the classified bomb, gave the following: \"Felt good. Probably killed a lotta bugs with that one.

Those few that resisted the Supreme Leader's actions were swiftly dealt with by soldiers loyal to the regime, this act has effectively given Dark Wing absolute power over all of Stalliongrad's affairs.

 ### Griffonian Events ###
 griffonian.0.t:0 "Here There Be Griffons"
 griffonian.0.d:0 "Unlike the Ponies to the East the Griffons had no Gods to guide them to unification nor great diplomats to mend their differences for there was no Heart's Warming eve to unite the various Kingdoms of old, but only blood and iron. So it was for hundreds if not thousands of year that Griffon waged war against Griffon until the fateful day that King Grover I of Griffinstone found the Idol of Boreas and used it's power to unite all of the Griffon Kingdoms into one. The newly founded Griffonian Empire would prosper for hundreds of years under the guidance of Grover's descendants, however that all came to an end with the reign of King Guto whom lost the Idol of Boreas. The Idol had over the years come to be seen as the symbol of Imperial power, and it's disappearance was followed with disaster after disaster. For years the Empire was ravaged by famine, disease, rampant rebellions and the ever increasing decadence of the nobility... and now we stand at the precipice of history, the Empire is nearly in ruins, the Griffons once more at each other's throats and the future uncertain..."

 griffonian.7.t:0 "War on Prywhen Communists."
 griffonian.7.d:0 "The communist revolutionaries of Prywhen have aquired huge influence on the griffon politics in recent years. Some even say that the fate of the all griffon race is now in their claws. Then, it is time for us to decide our own fate! Shall the declare war on communism and push the prywhen revolutionaries back where they came from, or should we, perhaps, join them?"
 griffonian.7.a:0 "Attack!"
 griffonian.7.b:0 "Stay out of this."

With situation stabilized somewhat, the Chairman agreed to hold elections for the highest state position, himself running as a candidate. However, while for some his victory may seem certain, radical Confederate Defence League has been consolidating its support base, while the moderate Friendship-Union Party and its prodigy candidate Braeburn have ran a campaign promising a truly democratic state for all species.

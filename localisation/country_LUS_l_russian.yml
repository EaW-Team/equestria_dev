POLITICS_PRINCE_ELIAS:0 "Князь Элиас Уайткрест взял власть в свои когти в январе 1006 года. Он еще молод и амбициозен, с великими планами для своего народа. Принц знает, что Луши имеет потенциал для модернизации в кратчайшие сроки, чтобы догнать остальную часть Грифонии. Он решил проводить мирную внешнюю политику и сосредоточиться в первую очередь на улучшении качества жизни граждан. Многие считают, что князь Элиас - это истинный лидер Люши, который давно должен был взойти на престол."
POLITICS_PRINCE_GERAR:0 "Княжич Жерар Уайткрест, младший брат Элиаса, видит Луши как сильную нацию, которая может занять весь бассейн реки Эви. Вдохновленный трудами пресловутого вингбардийского фашиста Биколини, он стремится создать корпоративное националистическое государство, уходящее корнями в религию и милитаризм. Он мечтает избавиться от монархии и провозгласить себя лидером нации."

LUS_fascist_coup_desc:0 "The younger brother of Prince Elias, Gerar, wishes to take the throne of the Principality of Lushi for himself. His support amongst the aristocracy is relatively small. However, that may change, if the current prince departs from the world of the living."

LUS_plot_against_elias_desc:0 "Prince Elias stands in the way of Lushian greatness. His peaceful attitudes are unbefitting of a true griffon. However, the Prince enjoys a good amount of support. By consolidating our own support, we might be able to remove him entirely."

LUS_kill_elias:0 "Убить Принца Элиаса"
LUS_kill_elias_desc:0 "It is obvious that we cannot kill Prince Elias while he is at his castle in Lumium. We ought to wait until he goes on a trip to visit one of the lords or leaves the Castle for another reason.\n\nIf we wait too long and Elias unites the nation around himself and his ideas, killing him and taking the country into our claws will be problematic."

 #Prince Elias's Agriculture Route
LUS_agriculture_improvements:0 "Крестьянский Вопрос"
LUS_agriculture_improvements_desc:0 "Most of our griffons work in agriculture. Most of them live under the reign of feudal lords, often in bad conditions. If we are to pull our country out of the technological and economic slump it is in, we need to start caring for the peasants."

LUS_buy_tools:0 "Новые сельхоз инструменты"
LUS_buy_tools_desc:0 "Griffons aren’t made for farming fields. To do it effectively, we need tools. By investing in teaching our peasants proper farming techniques and procuring them modern tools, we can ensure a better life for all of them. It will take time and we will have to dig deep into the Prince’s purse to fund the reform."

LUS_free_the_peasants:0 "Освободить крестьян"
LUS_free_the_peasants_desc:0 "We must free the peasants from their ancient servitude to the noble lords. They are worth no less than the rest of us. A modern state relies on citizens with rights and education. Serfdom will have to go if we are to modernise our country. Hopefully this will put an end to the peasant’s protests that destabilise the country."

LUS_enslave_the_peasants:0 "Полное закрепощение крестьян"
LUS_enslave_the_peasants_desc:0 "These meddlesome peasants seem too dumb to even understand the basic premise of our culture. The nobility care for and protect the peasants, who in turn feed the country. Very well, if the serfs do not want to listen, they will have to learn by force that the serfs belong on their turf."

LUS_organize_markets:0 "Создать устойчивый рынок"
LUS_organize_markets_desc:0 "The first step to getting ourselves out of this economic slump is organising the markets. Over the centuries, many lords have given licences to markets based on many different ideas. We must inventory all the market licenses and simplify all the rules, so that our crops actually reach the hungry beaks."

LUS_grain_import:0 "Ввоз зерна"
LUS_grain_import_desc:0 "Sadly, our peasants cannot produce enough food right now to feed us all. Luckily some of our neighbours still have enough food. Let us intervene and buy grain for the griffons, so that no commoner goes to bed on an empty stomach."

LUS_find_jobs:0 "Наёмные рабочие"
LUS_find_jobs_desc:0 "While our peasants are free now, they cannot enjoy this freedom with the current unemployment rates. However, with labour so cheap, we could plan some public works projects to employ the commoners and improve the countryside. We shall have the clerks prepare several plans, after which we can pick the ones that we deem most useful."

LUS_keep_them_busy:0 "Поддержать наших рыцарей"
LUS_keep_them_busy_desc:0 "We should encourage the peasants to find jobs in the military industry to support our noble military. By making sure that the people know who protect their newfound freedom, we can increase support for our chivalrous army."

LUS_keep_them_civil:0 "Keep them Civil"
LUS_keep_them_civil_desc:0 "The peasants should become artisans and work in our new factories. That way they will have a way to move up on the social ladder and increase the size of our economy at the same time. Agriculture alone is just not going to cut it, a modern country needs industry."

LUS_rice:0 "Рисовые плантации"
LUS_rice_desc:0 "Rice is very labour intensive to farm and will require many smart solutions to get going. However, the benefits of such a reliable food source are not to be underestimated. With this, Lushi will be able to support a larger population, without any griffon having to worry about hunger."

LUS_potatoes:0 "Картофельные поля"
LUS_potatoes_desc:0 "Potatoes are very tasty and somewhat easier to farm than rice. Let us give our peasants a break and make potatoes our staple food source. To convince the peasants to actually eat the ugly things, perhaps Elias should go out to the countryside and eat a potato himself."

LUS_minimal_welfare:0 "МРОТ"
LUS_minimal_welfare_desc:0 "To ensure the wellbeing of those who we could not employ yet, we should implement a minimal of welfare. So we shall make sure there is enough food for the unemployed and that they get at least some welfare benefits. We simply cannot afford to be too generous right now, but this gesture should show the commoners that we do in fact care about them."


 #Prince Gerar's Agriculture Route
LUS_strengthen_aristocracy_positions:0 "Усиление положения аристократии"
LUS_strengthen_aristocracy_positions_desc:0 "Only a strong elite can lead a country effectively. Luckily, Lushi already has a ruling class, the aristocracy itself. We must undo Elias’s reforms and expand the rights of the nobility. They will, in turn, reward us with their loyal support."

LUS_aristocratic_state_corporations:0 "Аристократические госкорпорации"
LUS_aristocratic_state_corporations_desc:0 "We have negotiated a deal with the nobility. They will put the revenues of their estates at our disposal for a limited time. These temporary State Corporations will help us to make enough revenue to expand our industry in other ways. It is heartwarming to see that the aristocracy cares so much for the wellbeing of Lushi."

LUS_capitalist_relations:0 "Страна победившего капитализма"
LUS_capitalist_relations_desc:0 "We should not only tie the old wealth to us, but also the new money. With bribes, favourable labour contracts and other bonuses, we will entice the captains of industry to cooperate with the government. With the right griffons in the right places, we can ensure the loyalty of the market."

LUS_increase_the_army_numbers:0 "Повысить число солдат в армии"
LUS_increase_the_army_numbers_desc:0 "Although our army has always relied on levies who were called into service when the need arrived. However, a strong state requires a standing army. Therefore, we must press the peasants into service. They might not be the best soldiers, but we will whip any reluctance out of them."

LUS_cadet_school_lumium:0 "Школа офицеров в Люмиуме"
LUS_cadet_school_lumium_desc:0 "A new Cadet School should be founded to instruct our forces in the nuances of modern warfare. We do not only need normal infantry, but also special forces. The best and the brightest of our soldiers will be trained in this school, to show the superiority of Lushi’s army!"

LUS_land_reform:0 "Земельная реформа"
LUS_land_reform_desc:0 "We need to reform the Aristocratic estates. They are outdated and keep smart griffons tied to their land. Besides, we can use the pretext of Reform to reward those who have been loyal to us. By taking land from other nobles and giving it to loyalists, we will increase our power and the amount of land we can use for other purposes."

LUS_war_tax:0 "Военный налог"
LUS_war_tax_desc:0 "War, the ultimate struggle to determine a nation’s place in the world, is the goal of all griffons. Our nation should be geared for warfare and support the glorious military as best as it can. All the commoners must make sacrifices to ensure the victory of Lushi and Prince Gerar!"

LUS_promote_religion:0 "Религия во все сферы жизни"
LUS_promote_religion_desc:0 "One of the peasants’ most redeeming qualities is their piety. This is something we can use to our advantage. By allying with the priesthood, we can spread fear of Godless communism. They seek to end our way of life and deny the Gods. Our Prince, on the other hand, has been given the right to rule by Boreas himself. The claws of the Gods should finally put down the influence of the reds."

LUS_new_recruiting_law:0 "Новый закон о призыве"
LUS_new_recruiting_law_desc:0 "We need more griffons for the army. Peasant, commoner, noble. It doesn’t matter. The expanded recruiting law will not make our people happy. But, they must accept their sacrifice for the good of the nation. As Beakolini teaches, a griffon’s life is worth nothing. It is only the spirit of the nation that matters."

LUS_proclaim_new_kingdom:0 "Провозгласить новое королевство"
LUS_proclaim_new_kingdom_desc:0 "Lushi is finally recovering and becoming a great nation once again. It is time to assume our role as one of the great nations of the world. The title Prince is simply not fitting for Gerar. Therefore, let him be known as King Gerar Whitecrest. Long live the Kingdom of Lushi! We will bleed and die for you!"

LUS_new_lands:0 "Великая Лушианская Нация"
LUS_new_lands_desc:0 "Our neighbours are weak and undeserving of their independence. The Lushian Nation should stretch well beyond our current borders. Our people are ready for noble conflict and our new enemies will be absorbed into our grand Kingdom."

 #Prince Gerar's Empire
LUS_war_research_effort:0 "Купить, то что сегодня дешего..."
LUS_war_research_effort_desc:0 "We have to admit that our budget is running dry. Therefore, we must show Lushian ingenuity. Let’s see what is cheap and available on the market today and use that equipment to our advantage."

LUS_prywhen_peasants_to_work:0 "Заставить Прайвенских крестьян замолкнуть"
LUS_prywhen_peasants_to_work_desc:0 "The people of Prywhen have resisted, but have proven to be inferior to Lushi. Now we will claim the right of the strongest. The conquered will now work for the conquerors, whatever the cost. We need those factories working."

LUS_oil_of_the_marsh:0 "Дары болот"
LUS_oil_of_the_marsh_desc:0 "The marshes of Prywhen have been unused for the longest of time. Neglecting their land like this really shows that these griffons had no business ruling on their own. With hard labour and infallible purpose, we will make those marshes into a useful part of our Nation."

LUS_fuel_the_war_industry:0 "Кровь машины войны"
LUS_fuel_the_war_industry_desc:0 "Although our nation is prepared, our industry could use an expansion. One never knows when a war goes the wrong way and we will require extra factories to fill in the gap. Let us add some fuel to power the war machine."

LUS_match_the_industry:0 "Проект "Фольё""
LUS_match_the_industry_desc:0 "We must match the infrastructure and technology of the great powers on the continent. The Folyo project will use both spies and science to further our own goals. It is imperative that this project is completely secret. Our enemies must not find out that we are stealing their ideas for our own use."

LUS_lumium_kivessin_railroad:0 "Ж/д путь Люмиум-Кивессин"
LUS_lumium_kivessin_railroad_desc:0 "With Prywhen firmly in our claws, it is time to connect the big cities of Greater-Lushi with each other. The railroad will have to travel through some inhospitable land, but our engineers will pull through and deliver a beautiful railroad. And of course, the King himself will ensure that the trains run on time."

LUS_prepare_for_war:0 "Все для войны"
LUS_prepare_for_war_desc:0 "We have made up our mind. Lushi is going to war. But a people can only win a conflict if their entire spirit, their entire being even, supports the war. With unwavering zeal, we will work for our victory. Our soldiers will fight, while our people will work for their victory."

LUS_integrate_the_host:0 "Интегрировать грифонов Сечи"
LUS_integrate_the_host_desc:0 "The Cossacks have always lacked strong leadership. Even though their individual people may have been strong, they lacked guidance. Now that their lands have fallen to us, we will integrate them into Lushi. Once we show them our power, surely the griffons of the Host will gladly join our Kingdom."

LUS_take_the_riches_of_gru:0 "Похитить богатства Грифуса"
LUS_take_the_riches_of_gru_desc:0 "Gryphus is a pitiful state with no right to exist. We have done the world a favour by cleaning that stain on the world map. Luckily for us, the Gryphus treasury was far from empty. We should make sure to transfer that wealth to Lumium for safekeeping."

LUS_conscript_the_cossacks:0 "Призыв Казаков"
LUS_conscript_the_cossacks_desc:0 "The hardy Cossacks will make a wonderful addition to our army. However, catching them on the great plains of their homeland will be hard. By expanding the Cossack register, we can discover who actually lives on our land and make sure the Cossacks join our army."

LUS_force_the_gryphus_peasants_to_work:0 "Заставить крестьян Грифуса вкалывать"
LUS_force_the_gryphus_peasants_to_work_desc:0 "The people of Gryphus are pathetic and they easily succumbed to Lushi. The lives of its inhabitants now belong to us. They will be mustered into our grand army and put to work in a new factory."

LUS_empire_realized:0 "Основать Империю"
LUS_empire_realized_desc:0 "In the struggle of Nations, Lushi has come out on top. Led by our illustrious King Gerar Whitecrest, we have taken our homeland to greatness. Our lands stretch from Stripeport to Lumium, an enormous swath of land. Therefore our King deserves to truly be crowned Emperor! May the Lushian Empire last a thousand years!"

LUS_prepare_drak_siege:0 "Подготовиться к осаде Замка Драка"

 #Shared Dealing with Nobles
LUS_what_are_you_unhappy_about:0 "Время не стоит на месте"
LUS_what_are_you_unhappy_about_desc:0 "We have an opportunity now, at the start of the Prince’s reign, to actually implement reforms. First of all, we need to deal with the problems of a couple of stubborn nobles. Lord Drak, Lord Matton and Lord Rosefeather."

LUS_approach_drak:0 "Найти подход к Лорду Драку"
LUS_approach_drak_desc:0 "Lord Marven Drak controls a lot of fiefs from which most of the knights and levies of the realm come from. Lately we have been noticing that recruits don’t reach the army anymore. Although the Lord denies it, the Prince knows that he has his eyes on Princess Mira, even though she is way younger than him. We can approach him, or find another way."

LUS_drak_marriage:0 "Свадьба Драка"
LUS_drak_marriage_desc:0 "We have agreed to offer Princess Mira as tribute to Drak. Now we have to plan the wedding. It will not be a fun affair for our family, although Drak is apparently looking forward to it."

LUS_resolve_the_situation_in_damoi:0 "Решить проблему в Кессабите"
LUS_resolve_the_situation_in_damoi_desc:0 "It seems that Lord Matton’s peasants in Cessabit are having a bad harvest and that’s why the Lord is unable to pay taxes. Aditionally, the lack of proper infrastructure makes sending food to the capital a costly undertaking. We should pay him a visit and see for ourselves what is going on. Until then, the rest of the country has to compensate for Cessabit’s inability to pay."

LUS_new_supplies_on_track:0 "Получить припасы обратно"
LUS_new_supplies_on_track_desc:0 "If Cessabit was actually connected to the rest of the country, this wouldn’t have happened. We will have to make some sacrifices to get supplies from Lord Matton’s estate back on track and modernise our supply routes. That way the country can function normally."

LUS_approach_talvonia:0 "Найти подход к Талвоне"
LUS_approach_talvonia_desc:0 "Talvona is mostly under control of Lord Rosefeather and nobles fealty to him. He is a popular griffon, who supports moderate reforms. He is not paying us his full tax, instead using the money to help his peasants. We can convince him of our good intentions and have the good Lord throw his support behind us."

LUS_pay_a_visit:0 "Посетить Талвону"
LUS_pay_a_visit_desc:0 "To ensure Rosefeather that we mean well towards him and his people, we shall take some time to tour the fiefdom and explain our plans to the locals. With Talvonan support behind us, we will have taken an important step towards reforming the country."

LUS_create_lord_council:0 "Люшианский конгресс"
LUS_create_lord_council_desc:0 "Now that we have dealt with the most stubborn opposition from the Lords, we can reopen the Diet of Lushi, the ancient Council of nobles which decided on matters of great importance. By allowing the lords this autonomy, they should be willing to allow us access to their private armies, enlarging our recruitment pool."


 #Elias's Harmony
LUS_expand_public_branch:0 "Государственные дела"
LUS_expand_public_branch_desc:0 "We should discuss matters of State in the Diet. Lushi’s Commoners are not leading a good life and some nobles want to fix this. Perhaps we can convince the Diet that changing our way of government before the commoners take matters into their own claws, is the surest way to preserve the nobles’ way of life."

LUS_predict_the_revolution:0 "Остановить революционеров"
LUS_predict_the_revolution_desc:0 "Prince Elias has managed to convince the Diet of Lushi on massive reforms. The nobles will pledge their support to a constitution and a democratic government. Prince Elias, Lord Rosefeather and some other nobles have banded together in the Prosperist faction, ready to lead Lushi towards harmony."

LUS_create_pairlament:0 "Открыть национальную ассамблею"
LUS_create_pairlament_desc:0 "The first step towards a democracy is to elect national representatives. These will be allowed legislative powers in the National Assembly of Lushi. Prince Elias is throwing himself at the task with an enthusiasm one wouldn’t expect from a monarch giving away power. However, the Prince is convinced that this is the best way to ensure the prosperity of Lushi for long after his own death."

LUS_invite_representatives:0 "Пригласить представителей"
LUS_invite_representatives_desc:0 "After a brief period of campaigning, the elections were held. The people came out in massive support for the Prosperists, a victory for the Prince. With the votes counted, we should get the representatives settled in Lumium and get to work!"

LUS_run_pairlamentary_elections_in_states:0 "Выборы провинциальных чиновников"
LUS_run_pairlamentary_elections_in_states_desc:0 "The local estates, or assemblies, usually only represented some citygriffs and the nobility. We should make these bodies more representative too, with griffons elected from the commoners and peasants. With local representatives taking care of their needs alongside the nobles, the poor should have no reason to turn to radicalism."

LUS_lushian_constitution:0 "Конституция"
LUS_lushian_constitution_desc:0 "Lord Rosefeather has been spending a long time in his study preparing a document that would give all of Lushi the most precious gift. Liberty. For hours on end the noble slaved away on the Constitution, based on examples from all over the world. We merely need to present the document to the National Assembly and soon, every being who finds themselves in Lushi, will be guaranteed a worthy set of rights."

LUS_crown_the_king:0 "Предложить корону Элиасу"
LUS_crown_the_king_desc:0 "It will be hard for the Assembly to keep anything a secret from Prince Elias, but, this must be kept a surprise. The National Assembly has deemed Elias Whitecrest’s efforts for Lushi to be fitting of those of legendary Monarchs. Therefore, the people have decided to offer Elias the position of King. A coronation ceremony will be held inside the Whitecrest Castle, followed by a massive party!"

 #Elias's Reforms
LUS_catching_up:0 "Догнать современную промышленность"
LUS_catching_up_desc:0 "By making a sizable investment, we will be able to attract expert engineers and companies to Lushi to help us with industrialising the country. These griffons and ponies will want a large monetary incentive to come work here, but it is a price we are willing to pay for modernising the Kingdom."

LUS_construction_techniques:0 "Новые технологии строительства"
LUS_construction_techniques_desc:0 "Our construction workers need to learn the way of the future too. Stone and wood are replaced by steel and concrete. Shovels by bulldozers and muscles by cranes and other machinery. Let us master these new building techniques, so that we can make cheap homes and build factories more easily."

LUS_build_the_railines:0 "Подключить недвижимость"
LUS_build_the_railines_desc:0 "Under Feudalism, the many estates and fiefs of Lushi were barely connected to each other and more or less self-sufficient. This autarky meant low living standards and a lack of understanding about the rest of the country. The railroads will ensure we can finally all live together and the world will open up, even to b peasants living in the most remote villages."

LUS_oil_of_damoi:0 "Начать разработку Кессабитских нефтяных полей"
LUS_oil_of_damoi_desc:0 "We have known about the oilfields in Cessabit for a while, but the government was afraid of giving away the mining rights, since our technological backwardness could mean a company could force a bad deal on us. Now that we have the technology to do it ourselves, Lushians can enjoy the benefits of the Black Gold themselves."

LUS_oil_research:0 "Нефтеперерабатывающие заводы"
LUS_oil_research_desc:0 "The fields in Cessabit are nice, but not enough to support our growing oil-powered economy alone. Luckily alchemy has come far since the time we tried turning lead into gold. We can now transmute several substances into usable oil. The transformation process is hard and requires special plants, but it just might be what we need."

LUS_rubber_program:0 "Добыча резины"
LUS_rubber_program_desc:0 "Gryphem is a suitable place for Rubber plantations. The substance is used for tires and is not only important for the civilian economy, but also for tracked vehicles and warplanes. Having our own supply would make our country that much safer, should we have to fight of a threat alone."

LUS_trucks:0 "’Крайвонский Автомобильный Завод’"
LUS_trucks_desc:0 "Kravon Automobile Company, or KAC, is Lushi’s attempt to enter the car-market. Some of the brightest engineers in Lushi have started to figure out motorised vehicles from the very basics. As the first cars roll of the assembly lines, we could use their experience to research half-tracked half armoured vehicles to protect our troops in battle."

LUS_buy_trains_in_griffonia:0 "Поезда Грифонии"
LUS_buy_trains_in_griffonia_desc:0 "Sadly we can’t make enough trains ourselves to fulfil the demand for trains by both the military and the civilians. We will have to purchase some older trains from abroad. Hopefully our neighbours will give us a fair price."

LUS_the_rise_of_proper_industry:0 "Люшианский бум"
LUS_the_rise_of_proper_industry_desc:0 "Our economic potential is finally being reached! All our investments are starting to pay off as more and more of our peasants find work in the expanding industrial sector. Business is booming and we just have to watch and enjoy the humming of hard work in the factories."

LUS_fridges_in_every_house:0 "Холодильник в каждый дом"
LUS_fridges_in_every_house_desc:0 "Refrigeration is an amazing technology. Being able to store food and drinks for longer will make it so less food goes to waste. In effect, getting fridges in every home will mean that less factories will have to be used to package food, which will increase our industry somewhat."

LUS_quality_of_life:0 "Повысить уровень жизни"
LUS_quality_of_life_desc:0 "King Elias’s primary goal has always been to increase the commoners’ quality of life. To actually make them enjoy their time on this world, instead of just surviving. With the modernisation and democratisation efforts, he has actually made it happen. Now we can distribute some of our newfound wealth to the griffons. "

LUS_military_of_the_region:0 "Защищать, то что дорого для нас"
LUS_military_of_the_region_desc:0 "We have made amazing progress ever since the King came to power in Lushi. Sadly, our wealth might make our neighbours jealous. We must make sure to spend our new wealth prudently and not just on gifts to the population. Let all know that the Kingdom of Lushi will fight to defend what is dear to us!"

 #Shared Science
LUS_lord_military_staff:0 "Лорды-Милитанты"
LUS_lord_military_staff_desc:0 "The Lords of Lushi have always commanded their own troops in the field. Commissions to lead troops were not always given by merit, but were also political appointments. It is wise to keep this system in place, since our nobles know both the art of defence and the art of politics."

LUS_new_military_staff:0 "Молодые и способные генералы"
LUS_new_military_staff_desc:0 "Our noble officer corps simply is not sufficient. If we are to adapt to the needs of modern war, we will need specialised officers, not politicians, to lead our troops. Let us promote on merit, not class, from now on. Aside from improving the quality of our staff, it will also attract more hopeful commoners to the ranks, as they one day might be a general."


LUS_start_schooling_campaign:0 "Начать образовательную компанию"
LUS_start_schooling_campaign_desc:0 "The literacy rating in Lushi is absolutely abysmal. To do many modern jobs and operate machinery, a griffon needs to at least learn how to read and write. It will be a lengthy and costly process, but we should start schooling the peasants."

LUS_invite_scientists:0 "Зарубежные ученые"
LUS_invite_scientists_desc:0 "We do not have the time to wait until our new schools produce new scientists, we need to improve our technology now. To that end, we should invite scientists from abroad to lead our own research divisions. But they may leave if we cause too much trouble for them, so let’s treat them nicely."

LUS_open_high_schools:0 "Высшие учебные заведения"
LUS_open_high_schools_desc:0 "With our griffons going into lower education, we are not there yet. We will have to open High Schools as well, so that we can actually train these literate griffons for useful professions."

LUS_medicine_college:0 "Люмиумский МедКолледж"
LUS_medicine_college_desc:0 "The healthcare system in our country is not satisfactory, but we need somewhere to train our doctors and a place to produce medicine. The Lumium Medicine College will be that place. With laboratories, a hospital and plenty of staff, we will push Lushi to the forefront of medical technology."

LUS_poly_technical_college:0 "Политехи"
LUS_poly_technical_college_desc:0 "We lack engineers, electricians and technicians, since we lack the facilities to train them. By investing in a Polytechnic system of tertiary education, Lushi will soon fill the shortage of technical griffons."

LUS_state_funded_science:0 "Спонсировать ученые коллективы"
LUS_state_funded_science_desc:0 "With the facilities in place, our scientists have proposed all kinds of projects, but without funding, they will get nowhere. A system of distributing grants for research proposals will ensure that we will have a lot of experts available for government projects as well."

LUS_attempt_to_build_computer:0 "Построить ЭВМ"
LUS_attempt_to_build_computer_desc:0 "A computer is, at its core, an electronic calculator. But our engineers say that by figuring out the right language to speak to it and by giving the computer more calculating power, it could do much more than just add numbers. They say the computer could revolutionise the way we handle science and information."

LUS_magic_of_grass:0 "Магия Окружающего Мира"
LUS_magic_of_grass_desc:0 "Материалистические догматы не единственный путь прогресса. Нашим исследования помогают нам понять наше прошлое, которое открывает нам новые горизонты старогрифонской магии. Люши всегда был местом множества легенд и мифов. Магия здесь так сильна, что вы не найдете места в Грифонии, где магический фон так высок. Благодаря тому что мы находим в старых манускриптах, мы познаем Магию Окружающего Мира, зачастую, это дает нам больше, чем идиотские медицинские изыскания."


 #Shared Military 
LUS_expand_military_branch:0 "Оборона Страны"
LUS_expand_military_branch_desc:0 "With all the Lords at the table, we can now consider military affairs. Lushi has a rich history of knights and battles, but much of it has been lost as many of our Lords lost sight of their chivalrous ideals. Our plan is twofold. We will reinvigorate the knightly spirit in our nobles, while also building a modern army."

LUS_intensive_doctrine_research:0 "Изменить текущую доктрину"
LUS_intensive_doctrine_research_desc:0 "Instead of focusing our efforts on just one part of a doctrine, we should spread our efforts over a longer time. Although getting benefits now might be tempting, this might be a better long term plan."

LUS_form_the_royal_guard_desc:0 "It is time for Lushi to once again be the beacon of chivalry it deserves to be. A first step is to form a royal guard of the most promising young nobles.

LUS_from_the_ancient_tales:0 "Старые рыцарские истории"
LUS_from_the_ancient_tales_desc:0 "Every young griffon knows some of the legends of Lushi. The ancient tales of heroic knights fighting evil tyrants and dark monsters.

LUS_the_elite_desc:0 "The Young Nobles of the Royal Guard have learned much from their training in Lumium. These valorous knights are now ready to serve Lushi and bring the fight to all the enemies of their sovereign!"

 #Shared Economics
LUS_expand_economic_branch:0 "Экономические Проблемы"
LUS_expand_economic_branch_desc:0 "Distributing economic resources between the nobles always causes heated debates, as the Lords all have their own ideas on how to improve the country and usually their own estate in particular. We should force the Lords to cooperate on this issue as well."

LUS_lushian_weaponry:0 "Erus Acel"
LUS_lushian_weaponry_desc:0 "We need to open a new armoury. Our many blacksmiths are known for their mastery of steel. Instead of swords, however, they will be making rifles. The modern infantry griffon will be armed by Erus Acel, the pride of Lushi!"

LUS_improve_the_quality_of_life:0 "Поднять уровень жизни крестьян"
LUS_improve_the_quality_of_life_desc:0 "The endemic poverty that still rules in many parts of the realm needs to be solved. With investments, grants and projects the nobility can help improve the life of the commoners. We need to keep a good eye on their spending, however, to make sure the Lords don’t pocket the money."

LUS_steel_factory_in_gryphem:0 "Грифская Сталелитейная Мануфактура"
LUS_steel_factory_in_gryphem_desc:0 "Gryphem has some unexploited iron deposits which the local Lord couldn’t use by himself. He has petitioned us to invest in a mine and a steel mill. It won’t just provide jobs, but it will also give us more access to crucial materials for warfare."

LUS_talvona_institute_of_industrial_research:0 "Талвонский Институт Промышленности"
LUS_talvona_institute_of_industrial_research_desc:0 "Lord Rosefeather has always loved science. He has proposed to open a new institute in his estate. The researchers there will focus on supporting our burgeoning industrial sector. With another research institute in the country, we can expand our own research capacity as well."

LUS_rifle_masters:0 "Винтовки высшей пробы"
LUS_rifle_masters_desc:0 "Erus Acel has perfected the simple rifle to an art. The master blacksmiths have become masters of the rifle. The high demand for Lushian weaponry means that we can expand our production by constructing a new arsenal. The famed Lushian rifles also attract talent from other places, who in turn bring their own ideas and practices with them to complement our own technology."


 #Foreign Policy
LUS_befriend_prywhen:0 "Помочь Прайвену"
LUS_befriend_prywhen_desc:0 "It looks like the communist griffons of Prywhen are here to stay. This is a workable situation for us. By reaching out our claw in friendship, we might not only gain a powerful friend, but also get them to stop some of their operations in our country."

LUS_non_agression_pact:0 "Провести переговоры с Прайвеном"
LUS_non_agression_pact_desc:0 "The leaders of the GLA seem more reasonable than we at first assumed. If we look away from their purges of nobles for a bit and focus on pragmatism, we should be able to work with them. We have but to convince their leadership that a non-aggression pact is in both our interests."

LUS_prywhen_trade_route:0 "Прайвенский торговый путь"
LUS_prywhen_trade_route_desc:0 "Most of the world has closed their markets to Prywhen. This means that we have an opportunity to strike a lucrative trade deal. Surely these communists will not know much of economics, so we should be able to negotiate some favourable terms."

LUS_prywhen_research_treaty:0 "Прайвенская научная инициатива"
LUS_prywhen_research_treaty_desc:0 "The Communists have made some interesting discoveries that might be of use to us. Our scientists are jumping at the opportunity to cooperate with Prywhen. Let us send a request to Prywhen and ask them for a scientific cooperation agreement."

LUS_prywhen_defence_pact:0 "Прайвенский Оборонительный пакт"
LUS_prywhen_defence_pact_desc:0 "It is clear that Prywhen and Lushi share many common enemies. Even though it might seem weird to bind our destiny to griffons who detest everything we stand for, it is the only way to ensure the safety of our nation. Surely our friends in the GLA will feel the same."

LUS_prywhen_volunteers:0 "Добровольцы для Прайвена"
LUS_prywhen_volunteers_desc:0 "To assist our friends in the wars abroad, we can send some of our own communists as volunteers to Prywhen. Hopefully that will stop them from causing trouble here in Lushi. If they perish on the field of battle, good riddance to the troublemakers."

LUS_destroy_the_bandits:0 "Удар по бандитам"
LUS_destroy_the_bandits_desc:0 "The bandits are a threat to the stability of both Prywhen and Lushi. We will take care of this petty excuse for a state and get a bit of land from it in return."


LUS_brodfeld_partners:0 "Бродфельдские Партнеры"
LUS_brodfeld_partners_desc:0 "We have many associates and friends in Brodfeld. They could get us into contact with their King in their hour of need. With a timely intervention, we can still stop the spread of communism in our vicinity."

LUS_help_brodfeld:0 "Помощь легитимному правительству"
LUS_help_brodfeld_desc:0 "We must restore the rightful King of Prywhen. These communists may think they have won, but we will crush these Godless reds and restore the Kingdom. We will be Boreas’s will and Arcturius’s sword!"

LUS_royal_marriage:0 "Династический брак Вайткрестов и Киссау"
LUS_royal_marriage_desc:0 "Prince Tomado and Princess Mira have been seeing each other for a while now. With Brodfeld and Lushi as allies, we should endorse their marriage and unite the houses of Whitecrest and Kissau. Let the people celebrate this joyful union!"

LUS_claim_prywhen_north:0 "Потребовать Северный Прайвен"
LUS_claim_prywhen_north_desc:0 "It seems Brodfeld has managed to survive the insurgence. They are weakened now, still reeling from the communist attack. Let us strike now and regain some of our rightful land!"

LUS_question_brodfeld_rule:0 "Поставить под вопрос короля Бродфельда"
LUS_question_brodfeld_rule_desc:0 "The incompetent King of Brodfeld has proven that he is incapable of ruling like a true Griffon Monarch. As the house with the closest ties to them, it is our job to protect Brodfeld. Let us start by questioning the House de Kissau in a public speech."

LUS_lushian_prywhen_king:0 "Король Люши и Прайвена"
LUS_lushian_prywhen_king_desc:0 "With their legitimacy crushed in the eyes of the world and in the spirit of their own people, the House de Kissau has no reason to exist anymore. We will offer them a chance to join us peacefully. If they refuse, we will have no choice but to put Brodfeld under our protection by force."

LUS_brodfeld_scientists:0 "Бродфельдские ученые"
LUS_brodfeld_scientists_desc:0 "The scientists of Brodfeld are an eccentric bunch. They are smart, but often focus on weird projects way ahead of their time. We can use their intelligence to our advantage, but it might aggravate our own scientists. So let us take care to not offend the Lushian or the Brodfeldian academia."

LUS_apropriate_prywhen_lands:0 "Присвоить земли Прайвена"
LUS_apropriate_prywhen_lands_desc:0 "The lands of Prywhen, much like our own, are owned by a number of noble estates. With our control over the country established, we should make sure that any rebellious nobles lose their land. This will not only increase stability, but also give us more resources to work with."

 #Extra Military
LUS_organize_strategic_planning:0 "Основать Люшианский Стратегический Институт"
LUS_organize_strategic_planning_desc:0 "We should study other, more modern militaries and their tactics, as well as ancient works on the art of warfare. By making a library and institute to amass this knowledge, we can figure out the best doctrine for a modern Lushian Army."

LUS_strategy_of_defence:0 "Ставка на оборону"
LUS_strategy_of_defence_desc:0 "We have no use for wars of conquest. We should concentrate our efforts on making sure that no other country declares war on us. The concept of deterrence will help us with this. By making our military so hard to defeat that a war would cost more than our country can offer an enemy, no enemy would want to attack us."

LUS_strategy_of_offence:0 "Ставка на нападение"
LUS_strategy_of_offence_desc:0 "Wars cannot be won by standing still. Our troops must be brave and take the war to the enemy. By fighting on other peoples’ land, we protect our own from any serious harm. Our military should focus on the offence and the tactics that best suit this."

LUS_the_great_plan:0 "Планы победы"
LUS_the_great_plan_desc:0 "The Institute for Strategic Studies has found many works which state that planning is key. Indeed, has a creative plan not been the key in many a knight’s victory over evil? By planning and drilling every detail of combat, we will make the enemy fight on our terms."

LUS_the_massive_army:0 "Армия Короля"
LUS_the_massive_army_desc:0 "The commoners have been long neglected in Griffonian warfare. All the focus was on the noble knight and their gallant charges. However, a rifle can kill a griffon from hundreds of meters away and an artillery shell murders without regard for social class. Therefore, numbers and mass will mean victory. It is a harsh truth, but a truth we must accept."

LUS_defensive_bunkers:0 "Бункера, как смысл жизни"
LUS_defensive_bunkers_desc:0 "We should construct fortifications along the borders with our enemies. By appointing flexible construction crews for a long time, we can quickly decide which part of our country needs to be fortified against our many neighbours."

LUS_new_artillery:0 "Современная Артиллерия"
LUS_new_artillery_desc:0 "What our doctrine may be, modern artillery will have a role to play in our strategy. Artillery can destroy an enemy without putting any of our griffons in danger, whether you are attacking or defending. It is imperative that Lushi stays on top of artillery developments."

LUS_new_infantry_doctrine:0 "Новая пехотная доктрина"
LUS_new_infantry_doctrine_desc:0 "Infantry is the mainstay of every army, even the most modern ones. By focussing on amassing firepower and how to most effectively bringing it to bear against the enemy, we will be able to turn a tactical advantage into a strategic victory. Barrages from our artillery will smash any resistance to our valiant soldiers’ advance."

LUS_new_mobile_doctrine:0 "Доктрина маневренной войны"
LUS_new_mobile_doctrine_desc:0 "Tanks are the knights of the future! A core of armoured vehicles will be the tip of our lance. Like the knights of old our panzer forces will dominate the battlefield. For this to become a reality we must develop a doctrine based on speed and aggressiveness."

LUS_tanks:0 "Ли-1 и студия дизайна "Рико""
LUS_tanks_desc:0 "We should study some of the most famous tanks from the continent. Some light tanks will already be a massive improvement over no tanks at all. Fast and with machineguns and cannons, tanks are a true terrifying weapons platform!"


 #Shared Aircraft
LUS_griffon_aviation_effort:0 "Правь Люши небесами"
LUS_griffon_aviation_effort_desc:0 "For the defence of the realm, we will need aircraft, one of the modern machines of warfare. Fast and versatile, combat planes are the key to victory. Before we can start production, we will need to build an airfield to house our craft and decide on a doctrine."

LUS_griffon_fighter_focus:0 "Изучение истребителей"
LUS_griffon_fighter_focus_desc:0 "We should focus our efforts on the most humble of planes, the fighter craft. Specifically made to fight other planes, this plane will protect our skies from any enemy who dares enter it"

LUS_griffon_fighter_focus_2:0 "Изучение истребителей II"
LUS_griffon_fighter_focus_2_desc:0 "It is time for a more modern fighter. With better guns and most importantly, a more powerful engine, we can make our fighters that more nimble. Conquering the skies is imperative if we are to win any conflict and the Lushian Flyer corps will make good use of the works of craftsmanship that are modern fighters."

LUS_griffon_bomber_focus:0 "Изучение бомберов"
LUS_griffon_bomber_focus_desc:0 "Our enemies might focus on shooting down planes, but griffons still do live most of their lives on the ground. By equipping bombs on our aircraft, we will destroy any enemies on the ground."

LUS_griffon_bomber_focus_2:0 "Изучение бомберов II"
LUS_griffon_bomber_focus_2_desc:0 "Next to normal bombers, we should also consider close air support. These aircraft are specifically designed to take down ground troop formations and spread disorganisation amongst the enemy. Alternatively, we could continue with bigger bombers, who can effectively destroy enemy infrastructure as well."

LUS_griffon_aviation_effort_2:0 "Люшианская Авиация"
LUS_griffon_aviation_effort_2_desc:0 "With our plane designs complete, we should return back to the question of doctrine. With a larger air force comes the challenge of commanding and controlling the swarms of planes available. Whichever strategy we choose, Lushi should be careful to not neglect air-officers and support staff."

LUS_griffon_purchase_foreign:0 "Купить зарубежные самолеты"
LUS_griffon_purchase_foreign_desc:0 "It will take too much effort to make our own aircraft design. Luckily, there are still nations on this earth who are friendly to us. By paying enough goods, we will be able to purchase foreign designs, which are as good as anything we could come up with on our own."

lushi.1.d:0 "Величие Луши не знает границ! Все знают, что лучшие грифы живут в Люши! Это самое лучшее место для всей Грифонии! Давайте будем пить и танцевать всю ночь напролет, чтобы отпраздновать этот замечательный факт!"
lushi.1.b:0 "УРА!"

lushi.2.t:0 "Люшианские рыцари прибыли!"
lushi.2.d:0 "Рыцари помнят праздник, который мы организовали, чтобы отпраздновать люшианское величие. Теперь они пришли помочь нам в время нужды. Одетые в древние заколдованные доспехи с яркими знаменами люшианских феодалов. Эти великолепные виды оживили страну и дали нам уверенность в том, что мы можем победить в этой войне. Борей храни наших Рыцарей защитников! Давайте сплотимся вокруг наших паладинов!"
lushi.2.a:0 "Прекрасно!"
lushi.2.b:0 "Непостижимо!"
lushi.2.c:0 "Офигенно!"

#Lord Drak
lushi.3.t:0 "Предложение Лорда Драка"
lushi.3.d:0 "Влиятельный Лорд Драк - один из самых могущественных дворян королевства. Он старый и презренный во всех отношениях. До сих пор он отказывался помочь [Root.GetLeader] в реформировании страны. Слухи и шепот говорят о его желаниях. Этот безумец хочет жениться на Принцессе Мире, дочери Элиаса! Сама мысль о том, чтобы провести остаток своей жизни с этим грифоном, сделала принцессу больной и грустной. Однако, согласно традициям, отец решает вопрос о браках. Принц теперь застрял между его желаниями реформы и сердцем принцессы Мира. \n\nС утра Драк прибыл в Люмиум с своим окружением, он часами беседовал с [Root.GetLeader], а Мира молча смотрела на происходящее, но лорд Драк стоял на своём, его последнее предложение было таким, каким оно есть. Лапка Миры, за его лояльность..."
lushi.3.a:0 "У меня нет другого выбора, кроме как согласиться."
lushi.3.b:0 "Ты никогда не получишь лапку Прицессы Миры! Чернь."

lushi.4.t:0 "Политический брак"
lushi.4.d:0 "Многие лорды и знатный люд со всего Княжества прибыли в замок лорда Драка на северо-западе страны. Сегодня должен состояться брак с Мирой Вайткрест и Марвеном Драком. Ни один из гостей не отражал замок лучше, чем [Root.GetLeader] и принцесса Мира, поскольку они выглядели мрачными, как стены замка. "Это для будущего Луши, у нас не было другого выбора". Князь пробормотал Мире, когда он приготовился провести красивую невесту по проходу.\n"Не могли бы вы просто ... избавиться от него?"- прошептала Мира, ее глаза все еще казались обнадеживающими. [Root.GetLeader] покачал головой. Он взял ее за локоть, когда слуга сказал, что настало время. \n\nМира и Драк теперь были вместе, стоя перед священником Эира. Святой грифон повторил обеты молодоженов. "Да" - ответил Драк, садистская радость звучала в его голосе. \n "Да." - Сказала она мягко, пытаясь выглядеть счастливой перед толпой. Священник встревоженно взглянул на новую пару, как будто он чувствовал, что происходит на самом деле, но он продолжал. "Тогда вы теперь муж и жена. Богиня Эйр следит за вашим союзом.""
lushi.4.a:0 "..."

lushi.5.t:0 "Лорд Драк Веритас"
lushi.5.d:0 "Северо-западные земли Луши, принадлежат семье Драк. Похоже, что князь Луши каким-то образом оскорбил лорда Мальвина Драка. Тем более, что дворянин стремится разорвать свою вассальную клятву с Принцем Элиасом. В официальном письме с печатью лорд Драк клянется в верности [Root.GetLeader] и хочет, чтобы его домен стал частью [Root.GetName]. Внимательно подумайте, поскольку это может привести к проблемам с Луши."
lushi.5.a:0 "Добро пожаловать!"
lushi.5.b:0 "Нам не нужны проблемы."

lushi.6.t:0 "Лорд Дракс оставил нас"
lushi.6.d:0 "Пришло известие о том, что лорд Дракс поклялся в верности [From.GetLeader], и его земля стала собственностью его нового повелителя. В письме, в котором он объясняет свои действия, он утверждает, что если его честь находится под угрозой, он может отречься от его вассальной клятвы и найти другого защитника. Это может иметь какое-то отношение к тому, что Драку отказали в женитьбе на принцессе Мире."
lushi.6.a:0 "Чертов мудила."

lushi.7.t:0 "Замок Драк захвачен!"
lushi.7.d:0 "Наша осада Дракского замка оказалась успешной! Наши войска захватили стены, пробираясь к цитадели замка. Хотя сопротивление головорезов Драка, поддерживаемых войсками его нового повелителя, было жестоким, им не удалось сдержать наших храбрых солдат и рыцарей. Шаг за шагом они пробились к покоям Драка, пока они наконец не нашли предателя. Одетый в тяжелые доспехи и вооруженный булавой, он сумел убить трех рыцарей, прежде чем пал. Замок был взят, войска Люши снова контролируют окружающие замок земли. А дипломатами быстро была достигнута договоренность о прекращении огня. Люши, благословенная земля!"
lushi.7.a:0 "Замечательно!"

lushi.8.t:0 "Наступление захлебнулось"
lushi.8.d:0 "Несмотря на все наши усилия, осада замка Драка провалилась. Мощь его собственной дружины вместе с силами его нового владыки оказалась слишком большой для наших смельчаков. Сам Драк, с древней булавой на перевес, лично переломил ход битвы в последнюю секунду. Наши потери были слишком высоки, чтобы оправдать дальнейшую кампанию. Драк заслужил свою независимость от Люши..."
lushi.8.a:0 "Ужасно."

lushi.9.t:0 "Осада разбита"
lushi.9.d:0 "Из-за нехватки войск, отведенных на осадные работы, нашему кретину генералу не удалось должным образом осадить замок Драк. Мы потеряли возможность вернуть себе похищенные земли."
lushi.9.a:0 "Как так то!"

lushi.38.t:0 "Под покровом тьмы"
lushi.38.d:0 "Наш убийца сумел проникнуть в замок через канализацию. Конечно, все в замке Драка воняет подливой, поэтому разница где просочиться была едва заметной. Теперь убийце нужно пробраться к спальне Драка и нужно решить, что делать убийце. Если, конечно, уже не помер от спидорака."
lushi.38.a:0 "Отравить его."
lushi.38.b:0 "Застрелить."
lushi.38.c:0 "Задушить его подушкой во сне."
lushi.38.e:0 "Отзываем убийцу сейчас же!"

lushi.39.t:0 "Успещное устранение!"
lushi.39.d:0 "Лорд Драк погиб, а убийца уже где то в небе над местными лесами. Наше отношение к этому инциденту нулевое, а Принцессе Мире не придется стать супругой старого пердуна."
lushi.39.a:0 "Вот и помер Лорд Драк..."

lushi.40.t:0 "Убийца не смог убить Драка!"
lushi.40.d:0 "Каким-то немыслимым образом Лорд Драк выжил! К счастью, наш гриффон благополучно ушел, обеспечивая секретность нашего заговора."
lushi.40.a:0 "Имбицилы ..."

lushi.41.t:0 "Наш Ассасин был захвачен!"
lushi.41.d:0 "Наш план откровенно пошел в тартар! Лорд Драк не только выжил, но он умудрился поймать убийцу. Нужно готовиться к тому, что убийца расколиться и нас обвинят в убийстве."
lushi.41.a:0 "Какое убийство?"

#Peasants War
lushi.14.t:0 "Крестьяне отказываются работать"
lushi.14.d:0 "Наше укрепление крепостного права, похоже, имело обратный эффект. Крестьяне, финансируемые революциями со всего континента, отказываются работать! Хуже того, они крадут оружие из арсеналов и бушуют на сельской местности. Мы в шаге от того, как ситуация выйдет из-под контроля. Мы должны как-то вернуть доверие простолюдинов, прежде чем они захотят свергнуть нас!"
lushi.14.a:0 "Кажется мы слишком их тираним."

lushi.15.t:0 "Крестьянское восстание!"
lushi.15.d:0 "По всей сельской местности случилось открытое восстание. Крестьяне оккупировали города и деревни, вооруженные огнестрельным оружием, а иногда просто вилами и факелами. Многие солдаты сочувствуют им и сплотились на их стороне."
lushi.15.a:0 "Палками их, палками!"
lushi.15.b:0 "Вставай поднимайся рабочий народ!"

#I like Trains
lushi.16.t:0 "Покупка поездов за границей"
lushi.16.d:0 "Современная индустриальная страна полагается на железные дороги для перевозки пассажиров и грузов. Хотя у нас есть некоторые связи между нашими крупными городами, нам по-прежнему не хватает поездов, чтобы маршруты были стабильными и выгодными. Давайте закупать поезда из-за границы и наконец, вытащить нашу страну из феодальной задницы! "
lushi.16.a:0 "Прогресс не остановить!"

lushi.17.t:0 "Люши желает приобрести поезда."
lushi.17.d:0 "Правительство [LUS.GetNameDef] предлагает нам сделку, они хотели бы купить несколько наших поездов, для дальнейшей модернизации своей собственной страны. заплатив хорошую цену за поезда!"
lushi.17.a:0 "Продано!"
lushi.17.b:0 "Что там сказали эти дикари?"

lushi.18.t:0 "[From.GetName] согласился на сделку"
lushi.18.d:0 "[From.GetName] решила продать нам несколько своих старых поездов! Это, безусловно, решит все проблемы инфраструктуры, с которыми мы сталкиваемся сейчас. Остается только подтвердить сделку."
lushi.18.a:0 "Мы согласны!"
lushi.18.b:0 "Как нибудь в другой раз."

lushi.19.t:0 "[From.GetName] подписывает сделку"
lushi.19.d:0 "Правительство Люши подписало сделку, и поезда, которые мы подготовили для них, теперь находятся на пути к лушианским землям. Мы должны ожидать их оплаты в ближайшее время. Будем надеяться, что это только укрепляет дружбу между нами!"
lushi.19.a:0 "Хорошая сделка."

lushi.20.t:0 "Lushi подписывает сделку с [From.GetName]"
lushi.20.d:0 "Правительство [LUS.GetNameDef] купило поезда в [From.GetNameDef]. Они отправили нам вежливое письмо, в котором объяснялось, что [From.GetNameDef] купили поезда более выгоднее."
lushi.20.a:0 "Фу, позорники."

lushi.21.t:0 "[From.GetName] отказаться от поездов"
lushi.21.d:0 "Жадное правительство [From.GetName] решило отказаться от нашей самой щедрой сделки. Кажется, им нужны поезда для себя. Неважно, мы найдем другого продавца"
lushi.21.a:0 "Хорошо."

#Not a griffonian nation without an economic crash
lushi.22.t:0 "Кризис сельского хозяйства"
lushi.22.d:0 "Освобождение крестьян от их крепостного права привело к тому, что цены на продовольствие выросли, потому что крестьяне требуют больше денег, а некоторые вообще решили сбежать в города. Текущих темпов с/х недостаточно ,чтобы накормить растущее население городов. Наши зернохранилища по-прежнему полны, но кризис не за горами..."
lushi.22.a:0 "Мы сможем."

lushi.23.t:0 "Кризис модернизации"
lushi.23.d:0 "По мере поиска более эффективных способов ведения сельского хозяйства богатые крестьяне становятся богаче, а бедные крестьяне становятся все беднее и многочисленнее. У грифонов нет работы и нет денег на еду, которую продают богачи. Мы должны организовать новые рабочие мест, принять правила рыночка и поддержать мелких фермеров."
lushi.23.a:0 "Пойдем работать!"

lushi.24.t:0 "Сделка от Люши"
lushi.24.d:0 "[LUS.GetName] хочет купить качественное зерно в нашей стране. Кажется, что в их стране возможен голод. В сейчас у нас есть избыток и мы можем позволить себе быть щедрыми. Так что, продадим Луши зерно?"
lushi.24.a:0 "Да, они могут его купить."
lushi.24.b:0 "Ньет."

lushi.25.t:0 "[From.GetName] продает нам зерно"
lushi.25.d:0 "Мы спасены! [From.GetName] решил щедро позволил нам купить часть запасов зерна. Зерно уже грузят в вагоны и они уже на пути в наиболее пострадавшие от голода районы."
lushi.25.a:0 "Хвала, Эйру!"

lushi.26.t:0 "[From.GetName] отклоняет сделку."
lushi.26.d:0 "Мы в дерьме, так как [From.GetName] отказался продавать нам зерно. Они говорят, что тоже хотят кушать и фиг нам, работать на полях надо было, а не бундовать. Будем надеятся, что мы еще сможем протянуть"
lushi.26.a:0 "Затяните пояса потуже."

lushi.27.t:0 "Запасы еды кончаются"
lushi.27.d:0 "Отсутствие поставок продовольствия наряду с плохими урожаями опустошает наши зернохранилища. При строгом нормировании мы могли еще протянуь некоторое вреся, но уже заметны основные признаки голода. Мы должны действовать сейчас же, чтобы спасти жизнь наших грифонов!"
lushi.27.a:0 "Храни нас Боги..."

lushi.28.t:0 "Голод охватил нашу страну"
lushi.28.d:0 "Наши поля по-прежнему не дают достаточно урожая, чтобы накормить наш народ и без помощи из-за границы. Наши грифоны уже прибегают к подножному корму, оно не дает силы, но и не дает умереть. Наша страна умирает... Мы должны молиться о том, чтобы наши страдания наконец окончились, так или иначе"
lushi.28.a:0 "Эйр нас проклял!"

#War with Prywhen
lushi.30.t:0 "Крестьяне недовольны"
lushi.30.d:0 "Когда мы вступили в войну против Прайвена, все больше и больше крестьян начинают сочувствовать красным бандитам. Нам нужно следить за ними, чтобы они не поймали нас врасплох, как этих идиотов из Бродфельда."
lushi.30.a:0 "Стены умеют слушать..."

lushi.31.t:0 "Военные меры"
lushi.31.d:0 "С тех пор, как мы вступили в войну против Прайвена, у нас наступила ужасная экономическая проблема. У нас нет денег чтобы вести военные действия! Солдатам нехватает мушкетов, пороха и солонины! А за линией фронта царит дефицит продовольствия, строители отказываются работать! У нас конечно есть некоторые резервы, но за 2мя зайцами не стоит гнаться, так на что мы его потратим?"
lushi.31.a:0 "Стройте гражданские мануфактуры, вояки как нибудь справятся."
lushi.31.b:0 "Нам нужно больше оружия."
lushi.31.c:0 "Народ говорит бредни, финансируем сразу две отрасли."

#Gerar's Recruiting Law
lushi.37.t:0 "Мы можем снова принять новый закон о призыве"
lushi.37.d:0 "Мы решили ненадолго отменить закон о поголовном призыве, чтобы дать нашим грифонам некоторую передышку. Если нам будет нужно, мы можем снова ввести его в действие, это сделает народ недовольным, однако, предоставит нам больше пушечного мяса для нашей военной машины"
lushi.37.a:0 "Очень хорошо."


#Prywhen Events
lushi_prywhen.1.t:0 "[LUS.GetNameDef] предлагает дружбу"
lushi_prywhen.1.d:0 "[LUS.GetNameDef] хочет основать посольство на нашей земле. Кроме того, они рассказывают о наших общих интересах, таких как торговля и оборона, в качестве веских оснований для сотрудничества. Однако, их страной управляет принц и дворяне, и мы по-прежнему поддерживаем контакты с сторонниками, пытающимися сплотить коммунизм в Луши."
lushi_prywhen.1.a:0 "Давайте покажем нашу дружелюбность."

lushi_prywhen.2.d_frnd:0 "Кажется, эти крестьяне более разумны, чем нам казалось. Они приняли наше предложение, и установили официальный дипломатический контакт. Старому дураку Кисау это может не понравиться, однако, лучше быть на стороне победителя."
lushi_prywhen.2.d_no_frnd:0 "Эти крестьяне такие тупые и их идеология тоже! Они отказались от нашего когтя дружбы только по идеологическим причинам. Их ответ был оскорблением и почти достаточным основанием для войны. Мы переоценили способность коммунистов к мышлению."
lushi_prywhen.2.a:0 "Великолепно."
lushi_prywhen.2.b:0 "Готовьте винтовки, пора надрать пару красных задниц."

lushi_prywhen.3.t:0 "Пакт о ненападении от Люши"
lushi_prywhen.3.d:0 "Буржуазия и империалисты Люши вернулись с новым предложением. Кажется, что они боятся нашей народной мощи и ищут с нами дружбы. С одной стороны, это защитит нашу спину, но с другой, мы разочаруем угнетенных грифонов Луши."
lushi_prywhen.3.a:0 "Мы должны прагматичны."
lushi_prywhen.3.b:0 "Принципы превыше всего!"

lushi_prywhen.4.t:0 "Прайвен согласился"
lushi_prywhen.4.d:0 "Коммунисты приняли нашу дружбу. Мы можем спокойно спать по ночам, зная, что красная волна не утопит нас в крови"
lushi_prywhen.4.a:0 "Хорошо."

lushi_prywhen.5.t:0 "Прайвен отказался"
lushi_prywhen.5.d:0 "Похоже, что у коммунистов есть планы нападения на нас, ведь они не хотят принимать нашу дружбу. Хорошо, пусть приходят, мы будем готовы"
lushi_prywhen.5.a:0 "На этом наши полномочия, все."

lushi_prywhen.6.t:0 "Торговый маршрут Люмиум-Кивессин"
lushi_prywhen.6.d:0 "Люши хочет поддержать нашу дружбу, установив торговый путь между нашими странами, эта сделка будет выгодна обеим сторонам. Но должны ли мы действительно принимать товары, производимые буржуями? От страдания и экспдуатации других?"
lushi_prywhen.6.a:0 "Мы будем использовать эти вещи во благо народа!"
lushi_prywhen.6.b:0 "Нет."

lushi_prywhen.7.t:0 "[From.GetName] принимает сделку"
lushi_prywhen.7.d:0 "Торговые пути между нашими странами установлены! Коммунисты открыли свои города для торговли с нами, что дает нам исключительное право в продаже товаров Прайвена на мировом рынке! Это очень поможет нашей экономике."

lushi_prywhen.9.t:0 "Совместные гражданские исследования с Люши"
lushi_prywhen.9.d:0 "Вельможки Люши снова попросили нас о помощи. Они хотят, чтобы мы подписали договор о научных исследованиях, работая вместе над важными исследованиями. Будем ли мы принимать их помощь, чтобы сделать мир лучше?"

lushi_brodfeld.1.d:0 "Сегодня [LUS.GetLeader] выступил перед толпой в Люмиуме. Он воскликнул, что король в Бродфельда утратил священное право править, когда он допустил восстание, которое вылилось в затяжную кровопролитную мясорубку. Киссау нельзя доверять, поскольку они неизбежно обагрят земли Прайвен еще раз.

Документ, который прилагался к этому нахальному заявлению, перечисляет наши преступления против своих вассалов и своего народа. Они явно подделаны, но похоже, что Люши нас так просто не отпустит. Мы сдаемся или Прайвен снова утонет в крови?"

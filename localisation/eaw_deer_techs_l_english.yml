 tech_deer_misc_desc:0 "Through their special connection with spirits, some deer can detect minerals through the soil. It is similar to what certain ponies can accomplish, but our prowess goes further and wider."

 tech_deer_seer_a_desc:0 "We must not let  our intelligence programs go unaffected by a practice that could benefit it as much as it can from seeing- by training old and new spies and specialists in gaining and deciphering glimpses of the future, we can hopefully prevent and attempts at infiltration by enemies of the state."

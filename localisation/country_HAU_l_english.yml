### Ideas ###
HAU_trading_crossroads:0 "The Crossroad"
HAU_trading_crossroads_desc:0 "Haukland stands as a strategic location north of the Celestial Sea, very literally at the crossroad between Griffonia and Equus. In the past, it has allowed Haukland to be a bridgehead for invasions between the two continents and a hotspot of piracy. After the subjugation by the Grover Dynasty, Haukland became a simple series of halfway ports between the Empire's shores and Nova Griffonia, much to the free-minded Hauklanders' dismay. Under the leadership of Meyer, Haukland has resurrected the old crossroad toll. Ships either pay for protection, supplies or simply to get the Hauklanders off their back. Nova Griffonians, griffons of all stripes, Vedinians, Equestrians, pirates or even Communists from Stalliongrad, Meyer welcomes them all as long as they pay up. Many do. As it turns out, many ships don't think twice faced with pirates with air support. And all this trickles back down the pockets of Meyer's clique."
HAU_trading_crossroads_1:0 "The Crossroad"
HAU_trading_crossroads_1_desc:0 "Due to Meyer's reforms, our situation has evolved. We no longer rely only on selling back pirate loot. Instead, we are beginning to export our own goods."
HAU_trading_crossroads_2:0 "The Crossroad"
HAU_trading_crossroads_2_desc:0 "Haukland was long simply a trade post between Equus and Griffonia. Under Meyer's guidance, we have learned to harness the resources of the seas. Fishing and whaling are not just small subsistence activities, they are an industrialised source of revenue."
HAU_actual_industrial_base:0 "Haukland Industrieanlagen"
HAU_actual_industrial_base_desc:0 "The Meyer administration has allowed industrialization to really take off in Haukland through a combination of schemes, low taxes and loose regulations. Where we once had wet forests and desolate plains, we now have factories humming along and churning out goods for Haukland to enjoy or sell."
HAU_resource_extraction_idea:0 "The Riches of Haukland"
HAU_resource_extraction_idea_desc:0 "One needs not be a genius to know that there are bits to be made in Haukland but few knew that it was also possible to make a profit out of Haukland itself. As it turns out, Haukland's soil and territorial waters are full of previously untapped resources. And we have a whole class of griffs and ponies who, sensing the opportunity, got to work tapping them."
HAU_enigma:0 "The Glockenreiher Code"
HAU_enigma_desc:0 "Despite all our doubts, our engineers have delivered something beyond our wildest anticipations. We have finally gained our very own system of encryption. Named after a sneaky zebrican bird, the Glockenreiher and its rotor mechanism allows us to encrypt our communications and documents in a level of sophistication never seen before. Now, we can use them at our leisure and should any enemy eyes get too curious, they would only get series of meaningless numbers and letters."
HAU_best_pilots:0 "Meyer's New Aces"
HAU_best_pilots_desc:0 "Meyer's Flying Aces used to be among the best pilots there were, back in 979. They were bold, young, unorthodox and innovative. But they grew older and fewer in numbers. Now, as we are investing in our Air Force, a new generation of pilots are getting ready to continue the legacy of the Aces: to be the best of the best."
HAU_flying_insititue_idea:0 "Meyer-Institut für Fortgeschrittene Luftfahrt"
HAU_flying_insititue_idea_desc:0 "The story of Hermann Meyer and his flying aces began the Imperial Airforce Academy back in Griffenheim. It is only fitting that his success is celebrated and honored in his very own academy. Those who will leave these walls will have both a modern understanding of flying tactics and knowledge and the legacy of the Flying Aces' boldness."
HAU_piracy_idea:0 "Pirate Legacy"
HAU_piracy_idea_desc:0 "Haukland has long been a piracy hotspot, one that the Griffon Empire successfully eradicated, centuries ago. But piracy, like weeds, have a way of making a comeback. And today, once again, the pirates ships are sailing freely across the Hauklandish Isles."
HAU_absolutism:0 "Hauklandish Absolutism"
HAU_absolutism_desc:0 "Haukland under Meyer's rule has long been a place dominated by cronies and a certain laissez-faire attitude from the Graf. Not anymore. With the same passion he has applied in the past to the restoration of the Crossroad Toll and his creation of a safe haven for piracy, Meyer has now taken the true helm of the nation at large. A new promise has been made and few have any doubts that he will once again make good on it."
HAU_army_idea:0 "Haukland Armee"
HAU_army_idea_desc:0 "With needed reforms implemented, the Haukland army is finally on tracks to become a true fighting force and not just a ragtag bunch of misfits."
HAU_officer_core:0 "Generalstab"
HAU_officer_core_desc:0 "The most well-armed bunch of ragtags and misfits or in other words: our officer corps. Gathered from all over the words, these adventurers and former officers have pooled their knowledge of war for Haukland to enjoy. Just don't expect the same level of formality or discipline you'd normally expect from military officers."
HAU_smugglers_idea:0 "A Smuggler Port"
HAU_smugglers_idea_desc:0 "Every country has smugglers and strategically located islands have even more of them. Haukland is no different. However, it takes a few more steps to actually make smuggling a successful and durable activity, steps that we have taken."
HAU_successful_raid_idea:0 "Successful Raid"
HAU_successful_raid_idea_desc:0 "The pirate crews are still hungover from our last raid. We'll have to have them sober up, refuel the ships and planes and do some repairs before we can launch another one."
HAU_raided_idea:0 "Raided By Haukland"
HAU_raided_idea_desc:0 "The Hauklanders have raided our shores. It will take some time before we can repair the damages."
HAU_take_the_hoards_idea:0 "The Hoard Tax"
HAU_take_the_hoards_idea_desc:0 "There are some simple truths in the world. One of them is that Dragons like gold and will take it. As such, they used to be a drain on the world's gold supply. But once again, Haukland has defied common wisdom by sheer determination and a bit insanity. Now, the Dragons are paying their fair share. Well, as fair as can be when the taxpayers are fire breathing death machines."
HAU_airforce_with_a_state:0 "The Old Guard"
HAU_airforce_with_a_state_desc:0 "Haukland has been restored to independence by flying aces and they have left their mark on the tiny state. So much so that it has become known as an airforce with a state. With this comes a mastery of air warfare and a force to be reckoned with. However, it is also an aging force, one that has more and more trouble maintaining its superiority in a field which saw several decades of technological and doctrinal progress."

### Focus ###
HAU_meyers_wild_ride:0 "Meyer's Fiefdom"
HAU_meyers_wild_ride_desc:0 "28 years ago, Meyer gambled and won Haukland. Ever since, he tried his hands at many schemes, always succeeding. All the while, he never forgot his comrades and partisans. And for that, he has been called the Graf of Haukland."
HAU_consolidate_rule:0 "Meet With The Old Crew"
HAU_consolidate_rule_desc:0 "Ever since the Wild Ride, the old imperial pilots have formed the true base of Meyer's power and are the Graf's staunchest allies. It is high time to have a reunion and to talk about things to come among friends and comrades in arms."
HAU_strenghten_authority:0 "The Claws-On Approach"
HAU_strenghten_authority_desc:0 "For years, Haukland daily affairs were left to a class of cronies while the Graf kept himself busy with other projects, only directly managing what he needed. It's time to announce that his new pet project requires all of Haukland."
HAU_all_the_ponies:0 "All The Ponies"
HAU_all_the_ponies_desc:0 "Haukland has historically been a major refuge for adventurous ponies looking for unorthodox opportunities. Let's remind them of some history and incite them to come to our shores."
HAU_and_the_griffons_too:0 "And The Griffons Too"
HAU_and_the_griffons_too_desc:0 "Griffonia has not fared well since the Idol of Boreas was stolen and griffons have only seen the situation deteriorate. Many of them have heard the stories of Meyer's Wild Ride away from it all and of his successes. Let's spread the word that our door is open. If there is one thing that will attract a griffon, it's the promise of bits and less chances of it getting taxed."
HAU_a_couple_of_pirates:0 "Some Pirates"
HAU_a_couple_of_pirates_desc:0 "The world is full of pirates of all stripes and they always look for a safe harbour with opportunities for more plunder. It won't be hard to attract them here, at the Crossroad."
HAU_and_some_mercenaries:0 "And The Mercenaries Too"
HAU_and_some_mercenaries_desc:0 "Mercenaries are in high demand these days. Everyone wants their services but few countries are willing to host them in peacetime due to their inherent rowdiness. We do rowdy. They'll feel right at home here."
HAU_and_a_couple_criminals:0 "And the Criminals Of Course"
HAU_and_a_couple_criminals_desc:0 "Most countries would only see criminals as scum, probably not without reason but in Haukland, we believe in second chances for those who are looking to reinvest themselves outside of prison. And if we can squeeze some muscles and assets in the process, all the better."
HAU_build_an_army:0 "Shall Build An Army"
HAU_build_an_army_desc:0 "Haukland has pirates, flying aces and fishergriffs. What it doesn't have is an army. To fulfill Meyer's plans, we will need to build one. We will have to go back to the basics, get smart and cut a lot of corners. Hopefully, we'll have ourselves a force to be reckoned with. If not, most of our soldiers will know how to fight dirty already."
HAU_get_them_some_guns:0 "Give Them Some Rifles"
HAU_get_them_some_guns_desc:0 "Most of our new soldiers and crews still have to fight with a variety of weapons. Some of them are old guns brought back from Griffenheim during the Wild Ride and they're not even the oldest ones in use. If we are to stand a chance, we'll have to properly arm ourselves and not hope that our griffs bring back enough from home..."
HAU_implement_conscription:0 "And Fancy Uniforms"
HAU_implement_conscription_desc:0 "It's high time that we give our griffs in uniforms... Well uniforms. Not that they fight in their birthday suit but our soldiers have worn a mixture of civilian clothes and uniforms from all over the world. While it's not without a form of quaint charm, it is highly impractical."
HAU_actual_officers:0 "Acquire Some Officers"
HAU_actual_officers_desc:0 "The militaries in both Equus and Griffonia are known as slow-moving, rigorous and obsessive about discipline. Many competent officers end up leaving it in disgust. Most of them don't really feel at home among bandits and adventures or worse, civilians. We can offer them a middle ground, the best of both world: personal freedom and resources to do what they do best: war."
HAU_build_a_navy:0 "Shall Build A Navy"
HAU_build_a_navy_desc:0 "Ever since Meyer allowed for the return of piracy in Haukland, we have had just enough ships to launch our naval raids. But even then, the only reason for our success is the presence of Meyer's Flying Aces. We need to have a fleet capable of standing on their own legs. Well ships don't have legs but you get our point."
HAU_more_pirates:0 "A Few More Pirates"
HAU_more_pirates_desc:0 "Haukland still lacks a navy but we are making some progress. To do so, we need expertise and we need ships. Fortunately, pirates have both and we have already managed to attract some."
HAU_smugglers:0 "A Couple Smugglers"
HAU_smugglers_desc:0 "Creating a navy is first and foremost about military affairs but it doesn't mean we can't make some bits from it. With more naval capabilities, we will be able to give some protection to smugglers and expand our operations. We already have the contacts, let's get them on the radio. We are open for business!"
HAU_dockyards:0 "Our Very Own Dockyards"
HAU_dockyards_desc:0 "We have ships but none of them have been build here. They were all bought, stolen during the Wild Ride or in raids or broughts by the pirates and smugglers who have joined our navy. This won't do in the future. We need to set up naval works and start building our own ships."
HAU_start_industry:0 "Shall Kickstart Our Development"
HAU_start_industry_desc:0 "The Empire never truly invested in Haukland, let alone helped it develop an industry. Times have changed. This is now the center of our power and we can't rely entirely on the black market, loot and imports. With the new influx of people, we'll have the manpower and know-how to kickstart an Hauklandish industry."
HAU_electronics_experts:0 "Electronics 'Experts'"
HAU_electronics_experts_desc:0 "Despite the very limited modernisation of Haukland, the radio was adopted very early on due to the need the communicate between the islands and with the ships sailing near our shores. This has lead to the emergence of a large number of self-taught electronics users, some of them even otherwise illiterate. With some creativity, we can harness this unorthodox knowledge."
HAU_construction_scams:0 "Construction Scams"
HAU_construction_scams_desc:0 "To kickstart an industry, you need many things. Three of them are factory buildings, housing and warehouses. Some of our more finance-minded advisors have concocted a scheme to promote foreign investors. They may not get the returns they're being promised but we'll have our buildings, even if some of them won't be what you can call sturdy. Or safe."
HAU_first_factories:0 "Our First Factories"
HAU_first_factories_desc:0 "It hasn't been easy but through hard work, we have finally achieved our objective of opening our first true factory. There are still many kinks to work out but overall, the Hauklandish industry now proudly exists. We just have the small matter of making it profitable. And efficient. And safe. Well, profitable will do."
HAU_beat_the_drums:0 "Beat The Drums"
HAU_beat_the_drums_desc:0 "We are building a navy, an army and an industry. Only idiots wouldn't understand what Meyer has in mind. But for those who haven't, let's say it loud and clear: war is coming to the Crossroad. It's time to get ready."
HAU_intellectual_refuge:0 "Foreign Intellectuals"
HAU_intellectual_refuge_desc:0 "Haukland doesn't have much in the way of universities or scientists. But what we do have are a lax conception of budget, loose regulations and some very convincing guns. We'll incite foreign intellectuals to come work for us, perhaps even some without a criminal record."
HAU_empire_of_the_isles:0 "The King of the Isles"
HAU_empire_of_the_isles_desc:0 "Being recognized as the Graf of Haukland had always been one of Meyer's defining achievements but Haukland remained a small patch of islands in the northern sea. He aimed for something greater and populated by more dangerous inhabitants than pirates. No griff ever conquered the dragons. He would."
HAU_light_dragons_f:0 "Subjugate The Whelps"
HAU_light_dragons_f_desc:0 "Integrating the Dragons into our forces will be a difficult task in more ways than one. However, many of them are still young whelps and as such, they can be molded into our army. We'll integrate the Dragons in the Hauklandish army on our terms, even if some of their devastating savagery gets lost in the process."
HAU_heavy_dragons_f:0 "Convince The Elders"
HAU_heavy_dragons_f_desc:0 "The Dragons have been defeated but conquered creatures make for poor soldiers when pressed into service. Dragons, while in an entirely alien scale of strength, are no different from other creatures. To truly enjoy the fruits of our conquest, we will have to convince the mightiest dragons to work with us."
HAU_dragonlord:0 "The Dragonlord"
HAU_dragonlord_desc:0 "Through audacity, willpower and probably dumb luck, Haukland has conquered the Dragon Tribe. Never before has a non-dragon asserted authority over dragonkind. Woes to those who crossed Meyer for he flies among the greatest predators our world has ever seen."
HAU_crystal_mines:0 "Feed The Dragons"
HAU_crystal_mines_desc:0 "Any idiot out there knows that the first and foremost condition of stability is that the population is fed. Fail to meet this condition and there will be rebellions. While we have conquered the Dragons, we know better than to try and see what a dragon hunger revolt looks like. We will make sure that a fair part of our crystal mining output be set aside for the Dragons to feed on."
HAU_settle_the_isles:0 "Settle The Isles"
HAU_settle_the_isles_desc:0 "The Dragon Isles have long been a forbidden place in our world, a place unfit for sentient life other than the dragons themselves. But they are not the grim place the stories tell you they are. They are vast, rich, beautiful and dangerous. And now, they are ours. If Meyer succeeded in bringing an army fit enough to defeat the dragons in the rainy isles of Haukland, they will come to the Dragon Isles."
HAU_take_the_hoards:0 "Tax The Dragon Hoards"
HAU_take_the_hoards_desc:0 "The Dragons are known for hoarding vast amounts of treasure for little more benefit than pride and a love of anything shiny. Treasures are something we have much more use from and we are already feeding them precious resources. The correct answer is to tax them. We could just take it all away from them but it's always a little harder to force someone that breathes fire to just hand over the goods. Tax will do."
HAU_the_one_true_king_of_vedina:0 "Destroy Vedina"
HAU_the_one_true_king_of_vedina_desc:0 "Vedina has always been a thorn in the side of Haukland. Or maybe was it the opposite? What is sure is that out of all nations in the northern seas, the chivalrous kingdom had always been the least willing to deal with Meyer on equal term or in any sort of casual ways. It is high time we finally wipe that smugness off their faces..."
HAU_the_king_in_da_norf:0 "The King In The North"
HAU_the_king_in_da_norf_desc:0 "If there is one thing the communists in Skynavia do not like, it is monarchy. They will tell you about it. Meyer is not a griff to care much about is said about him but he certainly does not suffer idiots calling others to rise up and take what's his. It is time to show the Skynavians the meaning and might of Hauklandish capitalism."
HAU_the_coronation:0 "The Coronation"
HAU_the_coronation_desc:0 "The Dragons fell from the sky, the Vedinan knights bent the knee and the communists finally learned their lessons. Which king or emperor can boast of any such legendary feat? And who can pride themselves in having gone so far after having started with so little? Who else than Herman Meyer? Now, the world will recognize what he deserves by might rather than birth: royalty."  

HAU_bridge_the_archipelago:0 "Bridging the Archipelago"
HAU_bridge_the_archipelago_desc:0 "Haukland has always creatively found ways to navigate its waters and communicate between the islands. One of these ways was early adoption of radios and extensive use of lighthouses. Unfortunately, they are woefully outdated. If we are to truly modernize our isles, we need to invest into radar technology and standardized radios."
HAU_coffe_fields:0 "Expand The Fisheries"
HAU_coffe_fields_desc:0 "Let's face the facts. Haukland has practically nothing of value as it stands but fish and sea salts. It's not glorious but everyone needs to begin somewhere. Let's invest into our fisheries by buying new boats and equipments."
HAU_coffee_canning_plant:0 "Haukland Fischkonservenfabrik"
HAU_coffee_canning_plant_desc:0 "Fishergriffs traditionally operate individually or in small groups in Haukland. While it may embody our tradition of rugged individualism, it makes for poor economic organization. We'll form a company to organize them, streamline the fishing industry and maximize profits."
HAU_incentivize_farmers:0 "Incentivise the Fishers"
HAU_incentivize_farmers_desc:0 "Traditional fishing in islands can only accommodate so much population. But with the advent of modern ships and more intensive high seas fishing, we find ourselves lacking workforce. We will entice more griffs and ponies to come to our shores and work."
HAU_coffee_profits:0 "Living Silver"
HAU_coffee_profits_desc:0 "Many in Haukland were skeptical of the investments made in the fishing industry. To be fair, you can't really expect adventurous pilots and pirates to find attractive the topic of industrial fishing. But we have proven them wrong. Under these masses of smelly scales lies bits just like those found in piles of lot. And after all, bits don't smell, no matter where they come from."
HAU_radio_schools:0 "Radio Broadcasted Night Classes"
HAU_radio_schools_desc:0 "Despite what most people hearing about Haukland may think, our homes are not ramshackle sheds without electricity or comfort. They are comfortless ramshackle sheds equipped with radios! Through these radios, we can spread knowledge to the masses and help them educate themselves the Hauklandish way. It may be unorthodox but we don't do orthodox."
HAU_open_high_schools:0 "Fund High Schools"
HAU_open_high_schools_desc:0 "Now that we have somewhat caught up in the education field, we can begin to fund and build some high schools where our foals and fledglings will be able to gain a proper education. It will be much more effective but we'll always remember fondly the days we could simply turn off a boring teacher on the radio."
HAU_whaleing:0 "Support the Whaling Industry"
HAU_whaleing_desc:0 "Whaling is a century-old tradition among Hauklandish fishergriffs but it has always been a difficult and even deadly activity. Through subsidies and investments, we can help our whalers to modernize and make their activity more efficient and safe. This could potentially revolutionize that industry for years to come and contribute significantly to our coffers."
HAU_expand_dockyards:0 "Expand the Dockyards"
HAU_expand_dockyards_desc:0 "Ships adapted to whaling are hard to come by and expensive. If we produce them locally, we can cut costs and improve them through direct contact with the whalers themselves."
HAU_mechanical_slaughter_techniques:0 "Expand the Slaughterhouses"
HAU_mechanical_slaughter_techniques_desc:0 "Whales are not a fish you can just throw on a stale with some ice and call it a day. They requires infrastructure, workers and special tools to harvest all resources from them in an efficient manner. Haukland has had some of these slaughterhouses but nowhere near enough to accommodate the number they are arriving in now. We'll need to expand them."
HAU_whale_profits:0 "The Blubber Industry"
HAU_whale_profits_desc:0 "Whale oil is a valuable industrial and chemical product. And thanks to our investments, we have vast quantities of it. Now, we just need to begin exporting overseas. And the naysayers who say that whale oil won't be able to compete in the long term with petroleum product can go back swimming to Griffonia."
HAU_heavy_industry:0 "Industrialisation Effort"
HAU_heavy_industry_desc:0 "Fishing and whaling modernization was only the first step in the development of our economy. In this world of uncaring machines, there is no place for those unwilling to move forward. We need to continue our investments and pursue a true industrialisation."
HAU_island_roads:0 "Bridges, Roads and Railroads"
HAU_island_roads_desc:0 "For a long time, the Hauklandish used to move around the isles by boat or on their paws and claws. We have come a long way now and we must strive for Haukland to join the rest of the world where bus, trains and cars have taken their rightful place."
HAU_caneries:0 "Expand the Canneries"
HAU_caneries_desc:0 "Our cans have proven to be a great export success. It is not a surprise really. This era has been so troubled that the demand for lasting and easy to store canned products can be nothing but high. We need to profit on this by expanding our production."
HAU_military_industry:0 "Fund the Gunsmiths"
HAU_military_industry_desc:0 "Despite our reputation as a trigger-happy pirate nation, finding modern guns and ammunition has always been somewhat of a challenge in Haukland. By subsidizing our gunsmiths, we will allow them to truly began local production of weapons and ammo on a reasonable scale."
HAU_resource_extraction:0 "The Riches of Haukland"
HAU_resource_extraction_desc:0 "As a nation relying on import-export at the Crossroad, Haukland has always been a bit too heavy on the import part. While we could continue to focus on industrialization and modernization, it would be wise to review our lands and territorial waters to look for resources. Producing goods entirely based on our own resources will give some stability and certainty in an era that sorely needs them."
HAU_offshore_oil:0 "Offshore Oil Platforms"
HAU_offshore_oil_desc:0 "During the imperial era, several reports indicated that Haukland had access to untapped oil reserves. However, the revolution caused any plan to drill them to be shelved. These reports were actually a factor Meyer took into account when choosing where to ride to back in 979. Sadly, he never had the resources to begin drilling on his own terms. He has them now."
HAU_expanded_dockyards:0 "Reinforce the Shipping Lanes"
HAU_expanded_dockyards_desc:0 "To accommodate our increased output of raw materials and finished products, we will need more and sturdier ships to export them all over the world, as well as importing what we still cannot produce here."
HAU_dig_deep_and_dig_greedily:0 "Dig Deep and Dig Greedily"
HAU_dig_deep_and_dig_greedily_desc:0 "In this day and age, metals are in ever greater demand. Unfortunately for us so far, we always needed to import them and not cheaply. Meyer reactivated our mining program to drill the land looking for more metals. There can't possibly be nothing in the soil of these rocks!"

HAU_branching_out:0 "Branching Out"
HAU_branching_out_desc:0 "Before now, our military has been rather limited, being composed only of our few ships and marines. However, if we wish to truly create a nation, we must branch out and establish a proper military with which to control it."
HAU_army_modernisation:0 "The Haukland Armee"
HAU_army_modernisation_desc:0 "Our army is currently nowhere near large enough to match Meyer's ambition, and must be improved and expanded to meet his demands- a true army for Haukland."
HAU_modern_rifles:0 "Modern Rifles"
HAU_modern_rifles_desc:0 "Our rifles, while not ineffective, are quite primitive compared to some foreign designs. Our new army requires new weapons to match, and so we should design more modern rifles for our soldiers."
HAU_fill_the_armouries:0 "Fill the Armouries"
HAU_fill_the_armouries_desc:0 "Our armouries lie empty, even as we need to arm more soldiers. We should do anything it takes, recovering discarded weapons, buying them in bulk and ramping up production, in order to fill our armouries and the talons of our soldiers."
HAU_paratroopers_focus:0 "Fallschirmjäger"
HAU_paratroopers_focus_desc:0 "The difficult and spread out nature of our nation causes problems both for domestic and foreign military operations. While traditionally this has been solved with the use of naval warfare, recent developments in our air force have made the creation of a specialised paratrooper unit more attractive, as an alternative to invasion and transportation by sea."
HAU_recruitment_drive:0 "Recruitment Drive"
HAU_recruitment_drive_desc:0 "No matter what efforts we take, it is impossible to build an army without soldiers to make it up. Currently our pool of new recruits is extremely lacking, and if we plan on any sort of proper military we need to remedy that with propaganda and incentives."
HAU_special_forces_drive:0 "Black Ops"
HAU_special_forces_drive_desc:0 "We- or Meyer- often may be in need of soldiers to do more secretive work; the kind of work that our common soldiers may not be disciplined or devoted enough to do. By training elite, extremely loyal troops we will have the men to carry out these operations."
HAU_doctrinal_development:0 "Doctrinal Developments"
HAU_doctrinal_development_desc:0 "Despite our military expansion and modernisation in many areas, our doctrine is still outdated- something that is only worse with our updated and larger army. To do our new forces justice we should delve into modern military theory, with the help of both domestic and foreign experts."
HAU_support_squads:0 "Radio Squads"
HAU_support_squads_desc:0 "To go with our new infantry, we need ways of communicating. We should assign radiogriffons to our divisions to help aid in communication among our soldiers and create a more organised army."
HAU_actual_artillery:0 "The Cowitzer"
HAU_actual_artillery_desc:0 "An army cannot survive with soldiers alone- or, atleast, not thrive. As such, to support our grand army we should equip our troops with more advanced artillery guns."
HAU_anti_air_focus:0 "Guard the Skies"
HAU_anti_air_focus_desc:0 "It would by a pity for our skies to by controlled by foreigners, but we must be prepared for the threat of such happening. While our air force may be our first line of defense, if it is defeated our infantry should have an answer for our enemy's bombers- mighty anti-air guns to shoot our enemies out of the skies, and allow our soldiers defense against their barrages."
HAU_the_enigma_code_focus:0 "Adopt the Glockenreiher Code"
HAU_the_enigma_code_focus_desc:0 "Some engineers have convinced Meyer of supporting a "miracle" cipher machine where a machine decodes messages with a system using rotors and a plugboard. While it is not all it has been touted to be, it would still be a great boon to our military and allow for more secretive operations."
HAU_paratrooper_tanks:0 "Fallschirmjäger Panzer Division"
HAU_paratrooper_tanks_desc:0 "Stories of great war machines have long intrigued Meyer and with the development of the tank in foreign nations he has taken interest. As a counterpart to our elite Fallschirmjäger troops, our new panzer division would be our first entry into armoured warfare, and open up new opportunities for our army, as well as provide elite armoured support."

HAU_new_officers:0 "A Fresh Mindset"
HAU_new_officers_desc:0 "While we have an airforce, it is somewhat underdeveloped. If we are to take on the task of expanding our military, we need to rethink how we use our planes, and explore different doctrines."
HAU_strat_bomber_focus:0 "No Mercy"
HAU_strat_bomber_focus_desc:0 "In our new air force, we should utilise lightweight multiple use bombers- these useful planes can be used both to wreak havoc on our enemies, and to destroy their infrastructure and industry."
HAU_tact_bomber_focus:0 "Bombs For Days"
HAU_tact_bomber_focus_desc:0 "When developing more advanced bombers, we should focus on one thing above all else- destructive power. With more bombs and more powerful bombs being packed into each plane, we can rain explosive hell on our enemy's factories and soldiers."
HAU_new_airfields:0 "Connect the Islands"
HAU_new_airfields_desc:0 "Our islands are distant and difficult to travel between. While for long we have used boats to bridge this gap, with our expanding air force the opportunity for the use of air travel for transportation has also become a possibility. In order to facilitate this we must first expand our existing bases and develop one on the northern islands to allow transportation between the two."
HAU_fighter_focus:0 "Rule the Skies"
HAU_fighter_focus_desc:0 "If we are to use our air force at all, we first must control the air. Without control of the air, our soldiers are vulnerable and our bombers easily destroyed by enemies. Fighters, therefore, should be our top priority."
HAU_heavy_fighters_focus:0 "Guard the Armee"
HAU_heavy_fighters_focus_desc:0 "While normal fighter aircraft work fine, when it comes to defending our airspace from superior enemies, we do not need the range they offer- range that could be traded for superior weaponry and armor. Let us modify our airplanes so that they are knights of the sky. While we won't be able to go far from our islands with them, we can control our lands better."
HAU_doctrinal_development_air:0 "Proper Training"
HAU_doctrinal_development_air_desc:0 "Our air force is expanding and with the production of new planes comes the need for new pilots. While we have been rudimentally training them, it has proven ineffective, and should be reformed both to promote more thought on air doctrine and improve the ability of our pilots."
HAU_CAS_focus:0 "Support the Armee"
HAU_CAS_focus_desc:0 "Wars are not won with air alone and as such air power should be focused on supporting our operations on the ground. To do so we need to develop aircraft able to engage ground targets with precision attacks, something a specialised close air support craft would do finely."
HAU_napalm:0 "Napalm"
HAU_napalm_desc:0 "With our air fleet growing larger in numbers, and especially with our focus on close air support and bombing, the use of alternative weaponry has crossed the minds of some- and has reached Meyer, who has approved the use of napalm, a petrochemical and jelly compound which is highly flammable and destructive, perfect for use by our bombers."
HAU_rocket_projects:0 "Hauklandian Rocketry"
HAU_rocket_projects_desc:0 "Meyer's interest in rocketry is not new, however, before our air force was properly developed it was but a dream. Despite our still low resources, our leader has ordered research into rocket technology which he believes to be the future of warfare. Whether he is right or not is yet to be seen, but these investments will allow us to develop technologies few others have."
HAU_the_best_of_the_best:0 "The Best of the Best"
HAU_the_best_of_the_best_desc:0 "It is the belief of some that only the most elite should be allowed in the air force- which is considered by some to have a higher quality of life than other branches. By promoting this attitude and enforcing tighter standards we can ensure that our airgriffons are well-trained and disciplined above the rest."
HAU_flying_institute:0 "The Meyer Institute of Aviation"
HAU_flying_institute_desc:0 "Our focus on elite pilots and rapid development of more advanced technologies and doctrine has culminated in the opening of a university for pilots, mandated by Meyer himself- the aptly named Meyer Institute of Aviation. All pilots are to go through special training in this school, training them in both pilotting and how to fly at night."

HAU_naval_aviation:0 "Naval Aviation"
HAU_naval_aviation_desc:0 "The idea of aerial and naval warfare meeting has become more likely as technology develops around the world, and Haukland will not be left behind. We need to develop naval bombing planes, both as a supplement for our navy and for possible use in future carriers."
HAU_carrier_efforts:0 "Carrier Experiments"

HAU_new_marines:0 "Reinforce the Marineinfanterist"
HAU_new_marines_desc:0 "To control the sea with a navy is one thing, but to do so with both your navy and army is another. Our nation has a history of a strong marine corps, due to our island nature, and this should be promoted as we shift focus back to our navy."
HAU_winterhold_base:0 "The Winterhold Base"
HAU_winterhold_base_desc:0 "Winterhold, the most important city on the northern islands, already has a substantial naval base. However, to better connect the isles and allow more ships to dock for coastal operations, we should expand it more."
HAU_haukland_base:0 "The Haukland Base"
HAU_haukland_base_desc:0 "The naval base in our capital, Haukhamn, should be expanded. With our navy growing larger, we need a centrally located naval base for our ships to operate out of on blue-water operations and our capital allows both that and for our ships to be closer to civilian and industrial centers."
HAU_transport_craft:0 "Landungsboot"
HAU_transport_craft_desc:0 "Despite our many marines, we still have relatively unimpressive and ineffective landing craft. If we are to use our marines to their fullest ability, we need better landing craft for them to use."
HAU_destroyer_focus:0 "Patrol Ships"
HAU_destroyer_focus_desc:0 "To control the seas between our islands, we need destroyers to patrol them and maintain a constant presence. While our current designs suit us fine, we should develop superior ones to better maintain a presence in our seas."
HAU_submarine_focus:0 "U-Boat Experiments"
HAU_submarine_focus_desc:0 "The development of the unterseeboot, shortened by some to U-Boot, has fascinated many and is thought of as a sound investment.

HAU_guard_the_carriers:0 "Guarding Our Carriers"
HAU_guard_the_carriers_desc:0 "To keep our new carriers above water, we need escorts. While smaller boats are not effective at this, cruisers are the perfect medium to use for guarding our larger carriers with little defense of their own."
HAU_loot_the_ships:0 "A Legacy of Piracy"
HAU_loot_the_ships_desc:0 "Our coasts have long been havens for pirates, a tradition that is reflected in our navy. Rather than trying to wipe this out, we can embrace it, using tactics from the old pirates in our U-Boat raids and sailing."

### Events ###
haukland.1.t:0 "The Radio School Project"
haukland.1.d:0 "When the Haukland administration announced the broadcast of night classes on the airwaves, many were skeptical and expected most to tune out of such a boring topic. However, it turned out that these simple broadcast would kindle a thirst for knowledge throughout the isles. The initial audience was far greater than expected and only grew in popularity from there.\n\nBuilding on this success, the Haukland radio launched several new lessons for griffs of all ages. We are still a far cry from the more modern education systems being implemented throughout the world but we have managed to create a unique form of teaching, one adapted to our unique situation and resources."
haukland.1.a:0 "Wonderful!"

haukland.2.t:0 "The Fruits Of Our Labour"
haukland.2.d:0 "It wasn't easy but our education efforts seem to have paid off. Students of all ages have tuned in our radio broadcasts and learned a great deal from them. Through sheer creativity, we have defied expectations and educated our nation.\n\nSadly, the radio lessons are showing their limits and our citizens, eager to learn, are demanding more traditional libraries and schools, something we are beginning to have the budget for. Over time, this may mean the end or at least the significant reduction of radio schooling. To many of us, it will be sad but we'll always have our memories of this time we could tune off or in from a class with a flick of a claw."
haukland.2.a:0 "Great!"

haukland.3.t:0 "Environmentalist Complaints"
haukland.3.d:0 "The expansion of our whaling industry has been met with a lot of enthusiasm. The working conditions of our whalers have improved and profits have been more than satisfying. There is however one group that has been less than thrilled about it: the environmentalists.\n\nA group of environmentalists have gathered around a slaughterhouse in the Haukahmn harbor to demand the end of whaling in Haukland and the implementation of a sea creatures protection legislation. After getting roughed up by the whalers themselves, the police picked them up. They tried to send them home with a warning but the group was unwilling to let go of the issue."
haukland.3.a:0 "Just drop them into the sea."

haukland.4.t:0 "Haukland Fischkonservenfabrik Profits"
haukland.4.d:0 "Reports are coming in from the newly established Haukland Fischkonservenfabrik. Many fishergriffs expressed concerns about the move or lambasted the idea of "selling out". Ultimately, most of them agreed to join and work within the new standards and quotas. The result has been satisfying and the profits have dramatically increased. Thanks to our administration's parts in the company, our treasury has seen an influx of funds and expects more in the years to come!"
haukland.4.a:0 "Wonderful!"

haukland.5.t:0 "The Winterhold Oil Spil"
haukland.5.d:0 "Disaster struck off the coast of Winterhold. During drilling, a massive quantity of high-pressured methane rose into the drilling rig. It ignited and exploded, destroying much of the offshore platform. Bad enough in itself, the explosion caused a leak, spilling thousands of barrels of oil a day into the sea. Worse still, the manager of the oil of the offshore platform flew away rather than inform Haukhamn about the accident and organize the response. Some are speculating he may have been a foreign agent rather than a cowardly incompetent but now is not the time to speculate. Our precious oil is getting wasted and the fishergriffs are unable to fish unless we can clean it up. Oil, dead fish and birds are washing up the shores of our islands."
haukland.5.a:0 "Will someone think of the seals!"

haukland.6.t:0 "The Mad And The Ambitious"
haukland.6.d:0 "Twenty eight years ago, Meyer convinced a large part of the Imperial Airforce to let Republicans and Imperials settle their affairs and leave for adventure. And off they were. They settled in Haukland, declaring it their very own free state. Few outsiders thought they would last. Kemerskai swore to get back at Meyer but he never did. The Imperial Regency swore they would crush them but they never did. The Equestrians even sent letters inviting Meyer to negotiate and restore stability to the region, but Haukland stayed.\n\nThen Meyer decided to try his hands at piracy. His pilots were bored and followed him wholeheartedly. The locals too. And there you had it. The ancestral crossroad toll had been restored. Each ship had to pay up or enjoy chatting with the fish. It was all pretty straightforward. Nova Griffonians were enraged but they paid up. The Empire couldn't do anything on the account of having their fleet - and airforce of course - stolen but they did complain. The Skyfallian thieves complained too but eventually concluded that paying was cheaper than trying to run a full imperial navy on a city state budget. And so they did. The Equestrians again sent very strongly worded letters. Sharply written too. Meyer hanged them in his office. And so the Crossroad Toll was restored.\n\nAnd so, there they were. Meyer had fulfilled his promises to his pilots and to the locals. Haukland was prospering. Well, as much as they could. Money was flowing. People around eventually grew accustomed to their presence, like a cold rain or an annoying neighbour. They even found out that Hauklanders were very open-minded once you had paid up. Something that many ill-considered nations like Stalliongrad, Skynavia or the Republic discovered to be a useful asset. The Equestrians even stopped sending letters.\n\nMany said Meyer would have to go but he was still there and he wasn't going anywhere anytime soon."
haukland.6.a:0 "Long live the Graf!"

haukland.7.t:0 "The Speech"
haukland.7.d:0 "Herman Meyer gathered his supporters and friends in the closest place Haukland had to a parliament: the Haukland Airfield pilots' bar. He looked around the place fondly. It reminded him of his time at the old academy back in Griffenheim. Many old faces, most of them having joined him on the Wild Ride in 979. Without them all, Haukland wouldn't be Haukland. He took his place on the stage as eyes were turning towards him.\n\n"Dear friends. Welcome to you all. There's no place I'd rather be in this world than drinking until morning hours with all of you." Some raised their glasses to that and cheered. Meyer raised his glass accordingly and drank.\n\nMeyer spoke of simpler times. Times when a few plucky revolutionary pilots broke free from Kermaskai and forged their own destiny. Like the time Hans stole a flag from an Equestrian battleship, or when Jane ransomed a Skyfall Oligarch's son, only for him to propose after they paid up. Griffons nodded, laughing, yelling to add lurid details or howl in mock outrage. But there was a certain sadness behind it all - a nostalgia for times past. Meyer sensed the shift, and stared them down...\n\n"Yes. We truly had fun. But we're not getting any younger, are we? We've realized all of our youth dreams and then some but is it enough? I know lots of you have children. Some even who know you! Isn't it time we get some real money to leave them? Isn't time we think about our legacy? I say we get out there and show all these idiots out there that the Meyer Flying Aces are a legend! One that will make Grover's sound like the story of a rainy picnic! Are you with me?!"\n\nSeveral of the pilots bursted into cheers, spilling beer and whiskey all over while chanting. It took only a few seconds for all of the bar to cheer along. Meyer smiled. They were off to one final wild ride. One for the ages!"
haukland.7.a:0 "Meyer! Meyer! Meyer!"

haukland.8.t:0 "The Graf's Rule"
haukland.8.d:0 "For years now, Hauklanders have enjoyed some degree of autonomy. No one could really question Meyer's grasp on power but the Graf always left a certain form of laissez-faire in the way the islands were ruled. Some, well outside Haukland, saw it as a proof of Meyer's weak rule but the locals knew better. Meyer's rule was ad hoc. When he set his sights on an issue, all are to obey. As for the rest, he was happy to appoint others and let them line their own pockets administrating things for him as long as things were getting done. In the end, it was nothing more than dilettante rule.\n\nBut now, the situation has changed. The Ace of Haukland had now bigger plans and for them to be enacted, he needed control. Many of the old hauklander cronies were removed from their positions. In several cases, the move was openly supported by the locals frustrated by the cronies and who welcomed Meyer's rule. In most of Haukland, the rule was simply acknowledged without much fuss. And if some unfortunate accidents happen in the upcoming weeks to those who opposed Meyer, well... It was Haukland after all."
haukland.8.a:0 "I AM THE GRAF."

haukland.9.t:0 "All The Ponies"
haukland.9.d:0 "For centuries, Celestia has ruled over a prosperous realm and many ponies have reaped the benefits of it. However, not all of them are content under her rule. Despite all her principles and powers, there were many who could not enjoy all that life had to offer. After all, a cutie mark's promises could only take you so far..\n\nIt is to all of these left behind ponies that we took. Sure, they could take their chances fighting for the new kind of hope Stalliongrad was selling. They could also emigrate beyond the vast oceans to the pony communities in the Riverlands, New Mareland or even in Zebrica but really... What did these places offer but more of the same? What Haukland has, few have. Those are opportunities, great dreams and more importantly, someone bold enough to make good on them..\n\nThousands are answering the call of our recruiters. Migrants from all over Equestria and even further are arriving in Haukhamn and Winterhold. Some of them might feel a bit cheated after seeing the true state of our islands. Unfortunately, we have a rather strict no refund policy."
haukland.9.a:0 "Welcome to Haukland!"

haukland.10.t:0 "And the Griffons Too"
haukland.10.d:0 "Back in the revolution's era, it was understandable that only the bold would follow Meyer to Haukland. Back then, there was still hope that the Empire would be brought back to glory by Grover V. And for those that didn't think it ought to be, there were options. Kemerskai had escaped the counter-revolutionary slaughter. Aquileia and Wingbardy both stood free after centuries of oppression. But what now? Grover V is dead, Aquileia is a burning mess and Wingbardy is bankrupted. As for Kemerskai, he's barely holding together a bunch of corrupt warlords. But what ever happened to that crazy young pilot? He has been busy building the most successful pirate state in recent history.\n\nIt didn't take much to convince the Griffons to come and take their chances where bits are there for the taking. And for those that doubted Meyer back in the days? Well, the Graf is not one to hold grudges."
haukland.10.a:0 "Welcome to your new home folks!"

haukland.11.t:0 "Some Pirates"
haukland.11.d:0 "There are many spots throughout the world where a pirate can make a living. One can find many opportunities to make money in these parts but among the pirate world, there is one name that has caught on: Haukland. It is not any pirate that can boast to control a major trade route between Griffonia and Equestria, defy the major powers of our time and live. So it's only understandable than when we spread the word that Meyer was hiring, a slew of them jumped on the occasion.\n\nThe ports of Winterhold and Haukhamn have seen a great number of these pirates arrive in great number. A lot of them are wannabes simply trying to make a living around Griffonia but some were coming all the way from Zebrica.\n\nSettling these new recruits has proved to be a difficult task but that was to be expected. Pirates are not really the most disciplined bunch as we've seen from how they stormed the ports' bars after arriving. Let's just say that there were more than a few broken glasses."
haukland.11.a:0 "Hopefully they aren't too rowdy"

haukland.12.t:0 "And The Mercenaries Too"
haukland.12.d:0 "Campaigns to bring migrants to Hauland's shores is all well and good but in order to move forward with Meyer's plan, what we need is soldiers. Now it's true that one can train or conscript them from the population but it takes time and resources, two things that are precious and that we don't have all that much off. A solution could then be to simply intice griffs with actual combat skill to come to Haukland but those kind of griffs don't come cheap. Then came Erhard Frosch.\n\nMeyer smiled when he heard the name. Like him, Frosch was one of those young officers promoted in a hurry during the Griffonian Revolution. He was stationed near Griffenheim but the two griffs never met in the flesh. Frosch fought back against the approaching counter-revolutionaries when Meyer decided to fly away. When Frosch caught wind of it, he contacted Meyer over the radio. "I don't care where you are going or what you plan to do. I just ask you one thing: fly over the imperial army and scare them into a defensive position so my griffs can regroup. Consider I'll owe you." Meyer could have left them all to die but he obliged and Frosch managed to retreat and prevent a slaughter. The decision made Frosch an avia non grata in Kemerskai's circle and he chose the mercenary life when all Republicans were faced with a choice to follow the Republicans to Cloudbury or not.\n\nWhen Frosch heard about Meyer's recruitement spree, he offered Haukland a deal: he would put his experience at Haukland's disposal in exchange for an advantageous place to retire with his comrades. And he would pay back the last favor he owed."
haukland.12.a:0 "Welcome Frosch !"

haukland.13.t:0 "And The Criminals Of Course"
haukland.13.d:0 "While we are working on a more orthodox recruitment and immigration campaign, several within Meyer's circle have toyed with a most unorthodox idea to bolster our ranks: recruiting criminals. After all, many Hauklandish inhabitants were already criminals in exile or descendants of them. These islands were and still remain a place where one can reinvent themselves and to these advisors, there were no reason not to exploit it. The idea ruffled some feathers but Meyer ultimately allowed it.\n\nThe implementation of the "second chance" policy as it became known was done with little fanfare. The recruiters made sure to be a bit selective about those recruits and only recruit minor offenders who could reasonably be believed to not cause too much trouble if given opportunities. When it came to their arrival on the islands, they were dispersed into other ships rather than brought in bulk to prevent any unwanted "welcoming parties" from waiting them on the docks."
haukland.13.a:0 "I know they won't cause any issues!"

haukland.14.t:0 "Successful Naval Raid"
haukland.14.d:0 "The raiding party we sent out returned with a full cargo of loot. Their mediocre navy and police forces were incapable to stop the Hauklandish tactic. Our lads plundered the coastal towns out of everything of value not nailed down to the floor while our planes patrolled over the town. They made it out of there before the land forces could arrive.\n\nAs always, the loot has been sold in Haukland's black market and the benefits shared between the pirates, the support crew and of course, Meyer himself."
haukland.14.a:0 "Sucks to be them... Drinks are on me!"

haukland.15.t:0 "Naval Raid From Haukland!"
haukland.15.d:0 "Our shores have been hit by a raiding party from Haukland. Our forces were unable to stop the air-supported naval group sent by Meyer. Coastal towns have been damaged and looted. There are several deaths reported and many more wounded.\n\nIn light of this defeat, there have been many calls to restructure and bolster our naval capabilities. Only superior strength will keep the Hauklandish pirates at bay."
haukland.15.a:0 "Damn you, Meyer!"

haukland.16.t:0 "Failed Naval Raid"
haukland.16.d:0 "The raiding party we sent out returned bare clawed. Despite our superior tactics, the local forces managed to keep us from landing. Combat was brutal and cost us dearly. In the end, our pirates were repulsed. Pushing any further would have cost us more than the loot could pay back for and so the attack was called off.\n\nMemorial parties were held in the port's bars in the honour of those who died out there and couldn't be brought back. They drank in their name. At least, the bartenders made a profit from all this."
haukland.16.a:0 "Can't win them all."

haukland.17.t:0 "Raiders From Haukland Repulsed"
haukland.17.d:0 "Reports have come from our shores. A force of Hauklandish pirates have attempted a raid but were repulsed by our brave navy. The sailors were officially congratulated for their bravery.\n\nDespite this victory, several voices in our administration have called to strengthen our naval forces in order to deter Herman Meyer from again attempting to attack us."
haukland.17.a:0 "Not today, Meyer."

haukland.18.t:0 "The New King"
haukland.18.d:0 "As the Vedinian prelate approached to crown him, Meyer rose up. The old priest recoiled in surprise. He didn't say a word as the Hauklandish warlord simply took the crown of Vedina out of his claws. He then looked at the attendance and promptly put the crown on his head. The Vedinian nobles who had been "invited" were aghast but none of these chivalry-obsessed fools dared say a word. And that was assurance enough for him that they understood the truth. The North had a new king and his name was Herman first of his name Meyer the Conqueror, He Who Commands Dragons.\n\nThe priest meekly pronounced the finale ritual words, proclaiming him the rightful monarch of Vedina but really, they didn't matter. As for all things, Meyer didn't rely on rituals, tradition or laws. He simply did what he wanted and forced all around him to accept it. Satisfied of his effect, he began to walk towards the entrance of the Temple to introduce himself to his people as King of the North. As he walked past the guests, they began to applaud. The Vedinian nobility and foreign ambassadors were probably the least enthusiastic but still, they were conceding. The most out of place applause were probably the happy cheers of his old Academy mates, those few surviving Flying Aces that abandoned everything to follow him to Haukland three decades ago.\n\nWhen he stepped outside of the Temple of Boreas, Meyer was received by the applause and cheers of his troops and many Hauklandish citizens who had travelled to Turhamn for the ceremony. There were even some Vedinians. Meyer didn't mind. In time, they would warm up to him. And even if they didn't, they wouldn't say a word when their sky was filled with dragons. Hermann walked to the promontory. The applause began to calm down as the attendance thought he would speak. But Meyer - fervent in his old idea that act speak louder than words - simply rose up the symbol of all that he did: the bloodstone scepter. A thunder of applause followed but was soon surpassed by the roar of the dragons in attendance and the sound of a 21-gun salute. The observant one could also spot a young whelp clapping like a griff in the crowd."
haukland.18.a:0 "All hail the king!"

haukland.19.t:0 "Haukhamn's Other Lighthouses" 
haukland.19.d:0 "Haukland has always been a place where pirates, criminals, adventurers and exiles could hide more or less safely. But they are not the only ones. Throughout the worlds, various artists of all types have gone beyond the level of scandal tolerated in their homeland. Some used to end up in the Hauklandish isles to waste away trying to make a living and remembering the glory days. However under Meyer's rule and the thriving raiding profits, an entertainment industry began to flourish in Haukhamn. Back in 988, an exiled Feathisian opened the first cabaret in town, an establishment called the Leuchtturm. It was a great success and the Leuchtturm attracted many destitute artists, eager for a new chance. Over the years, new bars opened in the style of the Leuchtturm and the name lighthouse came to be synonym with these places.\n\nHaukhamn may not have the same glamour as Las Pegasus, Manehattan or Aquila, but it is certainly a place where one can create truly freely without a hint of censorship."
haukland.19.a:0 "Bottom's up!"

haukland.20.t:0 "Ruling The Airwaves"
haukland.20.d:0 "For a long time, Haukland has had little in the way of a cultural life. But since the independence, there has been an itch for something, anything to do. Many didn't have anything to enjoy themselves except booze or fighting but a lot of griffons and ponies had radios, a tremendously important item in these isles. And so, some have begun to enjoy themselves with them, taking advantage of the lax rule of the new administration. Workers of radio towers have begun to take to the airwaves and broadcast some pranks. They were followed by others playing music and others simply telling stories or holding debates. And by word of beak or random luck, an audience began to tune in. And so was spontaneously born the Hauklandish radio cultural life.\n\nOver time, some enthusiasts began to purchase or jury-rig more equipment. The broadcast became somewhat more professional but due to the state never intervening, anyone could try their hooves or claws at hosting radio shows. Exiled performers and musicians also began to produce themselves on the radio, providing Haukland with fresh and unique music.\n\nAnd now, if you get a radio in Haukland, you can tune in to pretty much anything you'd like."
haukland.20.a:0 "Where else could such a thing happen?"

haukland.21.t:0 "A Morning Flyover"
haukland.21.d:0 "It was a beautiful morning as Cobalt Breeze was walking around the Haukhamn market. The city was not as fancy as his native Fillydelphia but there was a vibrancy he enjoyed discovering. He had heard about the unsavory business the Hauklandish were involved in but he didn't really think about how it would affect the kind of goods you could get in a simple stall. Now, he was beginning to understand why his cousin was so enthusiastic about living here. Now, if that noise could just stop already. Cobalt Breeze froze when he realized the noise was strangely coming from the sky. He look up and saw a plane flying over the market place. Then, he saw it tip over and plunge towards the ground, creating a horrifying buzzing sound. That was it! They were under attack. Oh, why did he ever thought coming here was a good idea? He tried to take his cousin but fear got the better of him and he plunged into produce crates for cover. He covered his ears and trembled in fear. Then, a pain in his side. Shrapnel surely. That was it. He was dead. Except he wasn't and the pain felt more like a repeated kick. He opened his eyes and saw and angry griffon merchant yelling at him. He rose up and uncovered his hear.\n\n"Get out of my lettuce, you bum!"\n\nHe looked in the sky. The plane was flying into the distance and the whole market place seemed to not care. Still sitting in the crushed lettuces, he looked at his cousin who was leisurely comparing two cantalopes. He called her and she looked at him nonchanantly.\n\n"What in Celestia's name was that?!"\n\nShe shrugged."
haukland.21.a:0 "Oh. That's just Meyer."

haukland.22.t:0 "Flying Off The Handle"
haukland.22.d:0 "A car stopped near the Haukhamn airfield. The night was dark, disturbed only by the glow of the car's and the airfield's lights. Hermann Meyer opened the trunk and dragged Corn Cob out, kicking and screaming.\n\nThe unfortunate pony had met the Graf only an hour earlier while out in town. Haukland had been good to him. Despite all they said about friendship, Equestrian ponies weren't very big on forgiveness. He had made his time but it was only in Haukland that others finally started to forget about his criminal past. So, there he was, enjoying his new life in a bar when some bum ran into him, causing him to spill his cider. Corn Cob, not one to let that kind of disrespect go unchecked, called him off and may or may not have swatted the bum's drink out of his claw. He did though and the "bum" turned out to be the Graf of Haukland informally partying with his citizens. Nopony intervened to help him of course. Drinking friends tended not to be on the "defending you against the head of state" side. Long story short, he ended up in the Graf's car trunk.\n\nCorn Cob tried to negotiate his way out but Meyer had none of it. He simply grabbed one of his back hooves and began to slowly drag him. The pony let out a small whimper when tipped over but when he saw that he was being dragged on the airfield itself, he began to cry for mercy. Again, Meyer had none of it. They stopped behind one of Meyer's personal plane: a small aerobatic biplane. Corn Cob tried to run but Meyer grabbed him again and hit him. "Don't move. It'll be less painful", he simply said. Corn Cob didn't want to obey but his kidnapper began to tie him with a rope before he got another chance to flee. When he couldn't move anymore, Meyer simply left him on the ground and walked to the plane with the end of the rope in his claw. There, he attached the rope to the back of the aircraft. Corn Cob let out a long cry for mercy and closed his eyes, unwilling to see what came next. He heard the engine start, then the plane taking off, then Meyer laughing in the distance, then nothing. Was it death? If so, it was rather... Well, unlike what you'd think it was. Corn Cob opened his eyes and saw the end of the rope simply laying on the floor while the plane was flying away."
haukland.22.a:0 "Next time, it won't be attached. Or it will. Who knows?"

haukland.23.t:0 "The Dragon Awe"
haukland.23.d:0 "The Haukhamn airfield was buzzing with activity as Meyer was leisurely strolling around it. He liked the area. Due to the air traffic noise, few griffs built there and there were several lovely spots to rest and observe the planes taking off or landing. Today was no different but as he approached one of his favorite spot on a small bridge, he saw a foal watching the airfield. He smiled and asked what the foal was doing. The foal, probably not recognising Meyer in his civilian clothes, candidly responded: "I want to fly like the griffons and pegasis, sir. But my mommy says I'm too young to go in an airplane. So I come here to watch them." Meyer smiled. She reminded him of some fledgling bored to death in a Griffenheim manor. He sat beside the foal and began to tell her all about the various planes passing by. They went on for hours. At some point, the foal wondered: "What is the greatest plane you've seen, sir?" "It wasn't a plane", Meyer responded. The foal looked at him as if he was telling a bad joke. He smiled.\n\n"I'll always remember it. My father had insisted on taking me to a tour in Equestria. So there I was, bored as a fledgling can be, on a boat slowly going to Manehattan. Then, I heard some griffons gushing and I looked up in the sky. The biggest dragon you ever saw flew above us. It was absolutely wonderful. He was big as a warship and yet he was flying more gracefully than the best griffon flyer. And then, he let out a roar that shook the boat. It was the most powerful sound I ever heard. It shakes you to your bones. And do you know what was the most awesome thing about it? He just flew by. All of us on the ship were watching him. I think the crew even tried to arm some weapons to defend ourselves but he just didn't care. We were just ants floating on a big plank in the sea."\n\nThe foal just responded by an impressed "wow"."
haukland.23.a:0 "But some day, they'll see me..."

haukland.24.t:0 "A Close One"
haukland.24.d:0 "Today, an air race was held between numerous veterans of Meyer's Flying Aces, Meyer himself participating. The race was proceeding well until two planes collided. Both fell to the ground and crashed. One burst into flames, killing the pilot, while the other pilot managed to emerged, visibly injured, from his cockpit and stumbled. Upon rushing to the crash site, onlookers saw that the injured pilot was Meyer himself, his face covered in blood. After being hurried to the infirmary, it was found that his injuries were minor and he quickly recovered.\n\nA quick investigation dismissed any rumors of a deliberate attempt on Meyer's life. Karl Inclaw, the deceased pilot, was known for his poor life habits and the autopsy showed he had participated in the race drunk, causing the collision. Despite his injuries, Meyer himself participated in the funeral ceremony and lamented the untimely death of a griff he called a dear friend of his."
haukland.24.a:0 "It takes more than a crash to kill the Graf of Haukland!"

haukland.25.t:0 "Stellahall"
haukland.25.d:0 "Today, Herman Meyer finally visited his finished mansion. It was located a bit outside of Haukhamn, in a small but lovely valley that was now his private domain. The mansion had been called Stellahall, as a tribute to his late wife, and had been built in a style reminiscent of forest estates in Vedina. There was no better place to remember her than the kind of places they used to love when she was still by his side.\n\nThe place had it all. There were twelve luxurious bedrooms, twenty bathrooms with Equestrian appliances, an Olenian style sauna and other luxurious accommodations for any guests. There was of course a ballroom designed to imitate an Arcturian temple. A large state of the art kitchen and a cellar - filled with the best Aquileian Grand Crus and Skyfallian liquors money could buy - were ready to accommodate any whim. The attic even had a small movie theater and a massive electric model train system, a long time guilty pleasure of his. There was of course also the less amusing parts: a library and a personal office he could run Haukland from. Outside, the valley had been adapted into a garden separating harmoniously all the secondary structure: a swimming pool, a gymnasium, a hunting forest and a private airfield.\n\nOnce he was finally alone, he decided to wander a bit in the mansion to examine how faithfully the architect had followed his demands. After a moment, he stopped in the living room where he was greeted by a grand portrait of Stella. He smiled sadly upon looking at it. How beautiful she had been... He loudly grabbed a chair and sat on it. He looked to the right toward the hallways. Then to the left through the windows overlooking the gardens. He took a long breath and sighed a bit as his sight began to drift away. He fiddled with his claws for a moment and found himself staring at a blank wall."
haukland.25.a:0 "What now?"

haukland.26.t:0 "The Crown And The Grave"
haukland.26.d:0 "It was a cold but beautiful morning, Meyer thought as a small breeze blew on his closed face. The Haukhamn cemetery was almost empty, leaving him to his thoughts. He walked to the grave of his late wife. He never understood why she had always insisted on being laid to rest in a public graveyard, but that was Stella. Despite all the gifts Meyer used to shower her with, she remained true to herself: the epitome of modesty. And there she was. A simple grave in a simple graveyard. Meyer stopped and sat beside it. He wanted to speak but no words came so he simply stayed there calmly.\n\nA griffon widow walked past. Meyer smiled to her and nodded. "Good morning", he simply said. The widow looked at him in shock and left quickly without uttering a word. Meyer didn't mind the reaction. It was not every day that you would meet a king in full military regalia and ermine cape in such a common place.\n\nMeyer remained in silence for a moment. He then slowly took off the crown of Vedina from his head and put it carefully atop Stella's gravestone. The sight brought a brief smile to his face. He then stood up and slowly left, leaving the crown jewel of the North upon a grave, exactly where it belonged."

### LEADER DESCRIPTIONS ###
Hermman_Meyer_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 5th of October 953 in Crona\n\n§YBiography§!: Born out of wedlock in Crona in 953 from a minor noble and a peasant, Hermann Kissenberg-Bothkamp lived a strange childhood. His father was an imperial diplomat but devoid of fortune due to gambling. He still enjoyed a life of luxury, being hosted at a mansion outside Griffenheim by a noblegriff who had an affair with his mother. This situation gave him little stability or happiness but he did get to travel with his father and to attend a prestigious military cadet schools. As a young cadet, he had little interest in the knightly ways but there was one invention that captured his mind: the airplane. Sadly, joining the Imperial Air Academy was seen as a too lowly position for him. It was during that time that his family was expelled from the mansion of his youth years and that his father, now a drunk, began to lose favor at court. In a strange twist of fate, this left him free to follow his dream. After bidding farewell to his mother, Hermann signed on for the Academy with his mother’s surname: Meyer.\n\nHermann proved to be a naturally gifted and popular pilot, graduating top of his class in 974. He spent the following years writing extensively about aerial tactics much to the annoyance of the inept nobles in charge of the Academy who saw him as nothing more than an upstart fool. They regularly sent him away on useless missions. It was not all bad as a trip to Vedina in 977 lead him to meet the love of his life: Stella who he married within a year.\n\nAfter the Griffonian Revolution in 978, he was put in charge of the new republican air force despite caring little for Kemerskai’s dreams. When the Republic fell, he hopped in his plane with his comrades and they flew away to Haukland. While he found great success in reanimating the old Hauklandish traditions of raids and piracy, he also found tragedy as Stella died of pneumonia in Vedina in 980.\n\nNow, Meyer has made a name of himself as the Graf of Haukland and no more a simple flying ace or a traitor to both the Revolution and the Empire. But it is not enough for him. He desires more, much more.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
Meyer_king_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 5th of October 953 in Crona\n\n§YBiography§!: Born from a minor noble and a peasant, Hermann Kissenberg-Bothkamp lived a strange life. Ill-born into nobility and badly educated by an ill-adequate father, he struck out on his own, taking the name of his mother and joined the Imperial Air Academy. His superiors didn't recognize his talent however and it was only in 978 that he was recognized as great, being given the role of leading the Republican Air Force. However, when the counter-revolution happened, he once again struck out on his own with his comrades and fled to Haukland. There, he became the Graf of Haukland and the scourge of the sea. But that wasn't enough. In 1007, he began to reorganize Haukland to make it fit for a great war. Now, his achievement is over. He is Herman Meyer, First of his name, king of Vedina and lord of dragons. A legend, albeit an old and heirless one. But who cares about what happens ever after?\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
HAU_frosch_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 13th of July 947 in Marchtetten\n\n§YRank§!: Oberst\n\n§YBiography§!: Erhard Frosch was born in the lower nobility of the Katerin Principalty. They never enjoyed much court influence, let alone true wealth. Young Erhard had therefore few options in life. He joined the imperial cadets and became a career officer. He unremarkably served until 978 when he joined the Republicans in the Griffonian Revolution. However, due to his lack of charisma and lack of fellow republican Katerinians to support him, he remained a simple military commander at the service of the fledgling Republic.\n\nStationed south of Griffenheim, he faced the counter-revolutionary forces head-on. Despite his soldiers' courage, he was overwhelmed and faced the very real possibility of a massacre of his troops. That is when he received radio confirmation that Hermann Meyer had betrayed the cause and was fleeing. He then made the fateful choice of asking Meyer directly for one last air support. Meyer agreed and Frosch was able to regroup and retreat.\n\nHis career laying in ruins, he left the republican cause during the march to Cloudbury and became a mercenary. And now, having heard Meyer's recruitment drive, he came to Haukland to pay back the favor.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Riley" 
HAU_onyxstar_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 26th of February 972 in Galloprey\n\n§YRank§!: Oberst\n\n§YBiography§!: Onyx Star was born in a land-owning family in Galloprey and was far from the ideal foal: being unruly, easily distracted and prone to throwing tantrums. Being third in line and having little interest in the mining or logging business, Onyx Star was sent to Canterlot to study but after a year of parties, he failed his exams spectacularly. He was given a final option: the military academy. He agreed.\n\nWhile he did a lot better in the military than he did in the classrooms, the instructors failed to teach him proper discipline and he was frequently sanctionned. After four years, he was kicked out and returned home for a bit.\n\nThe prodigal pony stole some money from his parents and fled to the South East where he joined various mercenary group, at one point working for Dr Caballeron. In 1003, he formed his own crew and began to sell his services at sea, protecting ships from pirates or working for them. Until he got the news that Hermann Meyer was recruiting.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Riley"

haukland.27.d:0 "When the news arrived in Haukhamn that Cloudbury had fell, a gloomy feeling gained many. After all, even if Meyer and Kemerskai had parted ways, many of the old guard had been republicans back in the days. Despite the old marshall’s reputation being poor among them, they had little love for the continent they had left behind and the idea that republicanism would win out in Griffonia remained popular. But now, their estranged comrades had failed and many bottles were emptied at the Hauklandish bars as a result.\n\nDuring the weeks following the fall, rumors began to spread that some survivors from Cloudbury were making their way to Haukland. It wasn’t a surprise really, there had been others before and the isles had been nothing but welcoming for those down on their luck. When these survivors arrived, there were even some parties held in the capital and the tired veterans enjoyed all the best that the Hauklandish cabarets had to offer them. But then others arrived. And then some more. And then again.\n\nFinally, fear started to spread among Meyer’s administration that it was no refugee crisis but rather an organized retreat. After all, they had done it once in 978. Unfortunately, Meyer was unreachable, being in one of his impromptu and secret air trips. Nogriff was quite sure of where he was and therefore, no response could be organized. After all, the graf was known for his unpredictability and noone could pretend to know what he would want to happen. After all, maybe he would want to let bygones be bygones now that Kemerskai was out of the picture. Or, he would crackdown. But something was certain. If anyone dared to make the wrong choice, there would be a bullet for them. And so, they were left scrambling for the right thing to do."

Despite the meeting occuring in the dead of night, none had dared miss the meeting. The attendees were waiting in silence and there was tension in the air. Among them, Erhard Frosch seemed to be deep in thought.\n\nSuddenly, the doors slammed open as Meyer, still wearing his goggles and pilot outfit entered the room. He seemed unusually angry. Which didn’t bode well for any in or outside the room.\n\n“Well. I’ve been informed that we had a bunch of unwelcome guest coming to our borders. Now, I know that some of you still have some feelings for them. And that is fine. We’re all griffs here. But. This is Haukland. This is the country that I have built. It is a dream which works and which pays. And I’m not giving it up so that idiots who couldn’t get two different republics to work can put all of that at risk. What do you all say?”\n\nThe generals clapped and hailed for a moment, some more enthusiastically than others. Meyer seemed to relax a bit and turned his head toward Frosch.\n\n“Erhard? Can I count on you?”\n\nAll eyes turned on the old veteran as he answered calmly: “I’m at your orders, my graf.”\n\n“Good… Good! Now, about Kemerskai’s people. Find them and send them away. As for those who would try to remain or rebel… I want them hanged. I want them shot. I want them dropped into the sea. Every last one of them. Am I clear?”\n\nHe had been."

It tends to happen when pirates, fugitives and drunk mercenaries gather in the same place. What was different was that it almost never occurred in the morning. But this wasn’t a drunken brawl or a dispute being settled. It was a coup.\n\nThe garrison was taken completely off guard. After all, coups and rebellions had become rarer and rarer as Meyer had learned to “channel” the Hauklandish disorderly dispositions. But the danger was not coming from the streets alone. In both the barracks and the port, Hauklandish soldiers had put on NPR armbands and began to round up and shot sleepy Meyer’s loyalists. In the port, republican squads came out of military warehouses, clashing with pirates suspected of personal loyalty towards Meyer. Not even species or nationality could offer any clarity as Aquileian-born ponies and Fezerans smugglers who had served in the Garde Républicaine joined forces with the Griffonians.\n\nAs hours passed, the city fell in complete chaos as explosions and fires erupted in the city, boats and aircrafts with unknown allegiances began to fly over the city. And yet, as the republicans fought their way into the city, they couldn’t help but notice a strange enthusiasm in their opponents. Almost as if they were thinking to themselves “Finally”."

Did the soldiers really had to break his beak? When he turned to them, Meyer refused to look at him. It didn’t really shocked Frosch. The graf had always been petty like that. If you stood by him, you were the best of friend. If not. Well, let’s just say that the Haukhamn harbour was full of those who knew what then. Meyer looked at Sunglider and smiled.\n\n“Schnabel. Long time no see. It doesn’t look half bad on you, you know.”, he said, pointing to his left eye.\n\nSunglider had none of it.\n\n“I haven’t been your friend in forty years.”\n\n“Eh. We’ll see after a few drinks of schnapps. You’ve always been slow to warm up.”\n\nNo response. Meyer tried out a few other jabs at the general who couldn’t seem to care less. After a moment, he threw a fresh set of clothes to Meyer. Meyer picked them up.\n\n“Are we going on a walk?”\n\n“Sort of. If walking to your hanging counts as a walk in your book.”\n\n“Should I not be given a fair trial first? I heard you stand for those, Schnabel.”\n\n“You already have. 979, judgment in absentia for desertion, treason and theft of military equipment.”\n\n“Well, I did steal them from the Empire first. I remember you quite enjoying that”\n\nSunglider let out a chuckle before quickly resuming his stern face and left the cell, leaving Meyer and Frosch together.\n\n“And what about you, my dear Erhard? Is there a noose coming for you? You’ve broken your word, stole the achievements of others and killed those in your way. Just. Like. Me.”\n\nErhard looked up to Meyer. He was serious."

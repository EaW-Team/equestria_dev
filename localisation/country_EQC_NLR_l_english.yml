 ### FOCUS ###
 EQC_NLR_reorganise_the_government:0 "Reorganise the Government"
 EQC_NLR_reorganise_the_government_desc:0 "Jet Set has proven himself enough to warrant a second chance at power under her Majesty. His peers meanwhile have not and must be replaced by far more credible citizens of the new Lunar Empire. Many of those are likely to be fellow Thestreals who have long since been cheated out of any position of power previously under Celestia's rule."
 EQC_NLR_emergency_factory_work:0 "Emergency Factory Work"
 EQC_NLR_emergency_factory_work_desc:0 "News has been received detailing the intensifying civil war on the mainland. With this news has come orders to send assistance in the form of equipment and ponypower immediately. In order to fulfil this sudden directive all factories must begin conducting emergency work shifts to keep up with material demands. For the glory of the Lunar Empire and the Eternal Night!"
 EQC_NLR_love_a_bat:0 "Love a Bat Day"
 EQC_NLR_love_a_bat_desc:0 "With the age of the Thestreals drawing near it has become a requirement to assimilate non-Thestreals. Through intense effort we can convince the Thestreals to exit their self-imposed isolation and herd them into major population centres. Using parades, school activities, and..any other means needed regardless of their nature, we shall add Thestreals to everyday Marelander life...and they'll like it too."
 EQC_NLR_why_fight:0 "Why We Fight"
 EQC_NLR_why_fight_desc:0 "It was only through Luna's guidance that we ever settled down and ceased our hostile nature towards those unlike us. When she was banished we were demoralised and rejected society in spite of our saviour's exile. When she returned we reluctantly obeyed her call for peace and inclusion back into Equestria. Again Luna, no...Nightmare Moon has returned and we shall answer her call this time. We will fight for the Night."
 EQC_NLR_defend_home:0 "Defend Our Home"
 EQC_NLR_defend_home_desc:0 "Not only do we now have Celestial supporters in our own ranks and across the sea to worry  about, we also have our Griffin neighbours which aren't trustworthy in the slightest. As such we must prepare our soldiers for the likely time we'll have to defend our homeland as well as construct fortifications where necessary."
 EQC_NLR_invite_bats:0 "Invite Bats"
 EQC_NLR_invite_bats_desc:0 "New Marelander research and development has always lagged behind that our mainland Overlords. Due to our new views on Thestreals we can finally convince the smartest in their number to join our nation's research. Fresh brainpower should do well to help expand our research fields and hopefully close the technological gap we unfortunately share with the Mainland."
 EQC_NLR_infrastructure:0 "Infrastructure Development"
 EQC_NLR_infrastructure_desc:0 "Opposite of our previous Overlord, Lunar authority has voiced interest in expanding New Mareland's pitiful infrastructure. Between the new willingness of Thestreals to help map out their cave systems for transportation and Nightmare Moon's own statements regarding the importance of New Mareland's logistics in the "foreseeable future" has given us the funds to finally improve our network!"
 EQC_NLR_loyalty_to_nightmare_moon:0 "Loyalty to the Moon"
 EQC_NLR_loyalty_to_nightmare_moon_desc:0 ""It is by the Moon's light that I have been given purpose. It is by the guidance of Nightmare Moon that I attain a higher state of being. The night's beauty trumps all without any question, the sun is a horrid object. Is it through Luna's kindness that I am forgiven for my past transgressions and am relieved of the Original Sin in once choosing the Sun over her. In this I bow in obedience to the Lunar Empire.""
 EQC_NLR_mint_new_bits:0 "The New Lunar Currency"
 EQC_NLR_mint_new_bits_desc:0 "The old Celestial bits are effectively worthless due to the ongoing depression and we must begin minting a new and improved Lunar currency as part of our ongoing effort to fix the collapsed economy. Not only will we be helping ourselves but such an act will be warmly received by her Majesty as quite the gesture of loyalty. Anything distancing ourselves from the Celestial past is a good thing at this point."
 EQC_NLR_end_midnight_austerity:0 "End the Midnight Austerity"
 EQC_NLR_end_midnight_austerity_desc:0 "Even before Lunar forces took the helm of New Mareland Austerity had been in full swing for some time. The quality of life for the common New Marelander fell drastically as a result. With our debt quickly fading and the end of the road to recovery in sight the time has finally come to end the Austerity and begin focusing on improving the lives of our citizens once more."
 EQC_NLR_rebuild_the_nation:0 "Rebuild the Nation"
 EQC_NLR_rebuild_the_nation_desc:0 "Even with our current moves to reinvigorate the economy there still lies the fact much of the nation is in shambles and dilapidated. If we're going to fully climb out of this financial sinkhole we're in we'll need widespread reconstruction efforts across major population centres and bring everything up to modern standards. Without this we're not much better than the backwards Griffons just over the border that are spread out across the continent.."
 EQC_NLR_shadowbolts_focus:0 "The Shadowbolt Society"
 EQC_NLR_shadowbolts_focus_desc:0 "Legend says the Shadowbolt Society was founded 2,000 years ago by the original Shadowbolts who served Nightmare Moon. Others say the name is pure coincidence. What is true, however, is that the many of the most influential ponies in New Mareland are members of this Society and they have no qualms with assisting Nightmare Moon if it means keeping their heads."
 EQC_NLR_night_schools:0 "Public Night Schools"
 EQC_NLR_night_schools_desc:0 "The Nocturnal life style of bat ponies were never well respected or seen highly in the eyes of the Celestial Government, thus no public aid was ever given in regard to Thestreal needs such as public school. With Nightmare Moon in control she has seen fit to order the creation of public night schools that will properly teach the next generation of Thestreal kids in comfortable time settings."
 EQC_NLR_united_shadow_works:0 "United Shadow Works"
 EQC_NLR_united_shadow_works_desc:0 "Many of New Mareland’s largest corporations are run by members of the Shadowbolt Society. Now that the Society is overseeing the nation, these assets can be safely nationalised into one single Shadowbolt corporation. After all, nothing will really change."
 EQC_NLR_anti-celestia_propaganda:0 "Anti-Celestial Propaganda"
 EQC_NLR_anti-celestia_propaganda_desc:0 "Many New Marelanders do not have any idea how Celestia could ever be seen as bad. Due to this it'll be increasingly difficult to justify suppressing Celestial beliefs unless this is directly address. As such money must be put into a large campaign detailing why Celestia is the Oppressive Tyrant she is!"
 EQC_NLR_moonlight_highways:0 "Moonlit Highways"
 EQC_NLR_moonlight_highways_desc:0 "We do not have the funds to electrically light roads stretching into the rural regions of New Mareland. But at the same time the Moon's light is strong enough now to guide travellers if we clear forestry and other obstructions to keep roads out in the open beneath the Moon's gaze. Effectively citizens will always be able to travel free of worry upon our major road networks!"
 EQC_NLR_equal_bat_rights:0 "Equal Bat Rights"
 EQC_NLR_equal_bat_rights_desc:0 "While not officially so there was subtle bias towards Equestrians under Celestia. Be this intentional or not Thestreals were not equal to their kin on paper. Nightmare Moon has seen fit to rectify this immediately and now Thestreals are properly equal with non-Thestreals. Secretly so there now carries a bias in favour of Thestreals as well...vengeance is a dish best served cold."
 EQC_NLR_mine_the_bat_caves:0 "Mine the Bat Caves"
 EQC_NLR_mine_the_bat_caves_desc:0 "Bat pony caves are seldom if ever entered by non-Thestreals. Due to this they are rarely ever prospected and any valuable minerals found within have remained untouched for decades. With Thestreals now becoming a part of everyday life their caves have become open for advanced examination to discover and gather much needed raw material for the Industry at large."
 EQC_NLR_shadowbolt_clubs:0 "Shadowbolt Clubs"
 EQC_NLR_shadowbolt_clubs_desc:0 "By opening the doors of the Shadowbolt Society to all ponies in New Mareland, we will ensure a steady stream of loyal supporters. These ponies will bolster our ranks with many great minds and talents."
 EQC_NLR_magic_of_midnight:0 "Magic of Midnight"
 EQC_NLR_magic_of_midnight_desc:0 "It is well known that Thestreals have never been capable of magic like that of Unicorns. Yet there is a strange mysticism revolving around the Night whenever Nightmare Moon has risen. Now that this mysticism has been allowed to remain for a prolonged duration the effects of it have become very real. In the shadow of the night we are now unbeatable!"
 EQC_NLR_spread_the_darkness:0 "Spread the Darkness"
 EQC_NLR_spread_the_darkness_desc:0 "Our economy has fully recovered, our military is stronger than ever, and our population is inspired and loyal. With our secured internal stability we can now look beyond our borders to vile Wingbardy and the Karthinian pact that has always been a threat to our sovereignty. A formal request will be sent to Canterlot to invade and spread Lunar supremacy onto these pitiful birds."
 EQC_NLR_embrace_the_night:0 "Embrace the Night"
 EQC_NLR_embrace_the_night_desc:0 "New Mareland has yet to prove itself worthy of self-rule. Bat ponies have always remained as second class citizens to an even larger extreme than that of old Celestial Equestria. General Flawless Glow will be assigned to be Governor-General of New Mareland and take charge of properly shaping it into a colony worthy of the Moon."
 EQC_NLR_open_the_bat_caves:0 "Open the Bat Caves"
 EQC_NLR_open_the_bat_caves_desc:0 "Bat ponies have always been reclusive in their caves to such an extreme that they have their own industry and economy too. I can easily pressure my fellow Thestreals to open the caves fully and merge their industry and economy into the whole of New Mareland's. In the future event of war it'll be useful to have weapons manufacturies immune from long range bombing..." 
 EQC_NLR_daytime_curfew:0 "Daytime Curfews"
 EQC_NLR_daytime_curfew_desc:0 "Fact: We Thestreals operate most and best at night due to our nocturnal nature. Fact: Most of New Mareland is active during the day where most of us must rest. Conclusion: Daytime Curfews must be established to help manage the population better and root out partisan forces. Those that insist on staying out in the Sun past Curfew are obviously planning the downfall of the state and must be eliminated as a result."
 EQC_NLR_form_the_bat_pony_corps:0 "Form the Bat Pony Corps"
 EQC_NLR_form_the_bat_pony_corps_desc:0 "Up until now bat ponies have been discouraged and excluded from military service. Despite their natural militaristic nature making them easy recruitment targets the old Celestial Government saw fit to never put weapons into the hooves of those they could not trust and control fully. These are no longer those times! Luna's finest should not be barred from military service any longer..."
 EQC_NLR_horrors_of_the_sun:0 "Horrors of the Sun"
 EQC_NLR_horrors_of_the_sun_desc:0 "I personally understand the horrors of Celestia's baleful sun. However the many citizens of New Mareland, both Thestreal and not are very ignorant to these horrid facts. If I am ever to garner support to strike down that Tyrant of the Sun the population will need to understand why the Sun is so terrible and dangerous!"
 EQC_NLR_a_bat_on_every_corner:0 "A Bat on Every Corner"
 EQC_NLR_a_bat_on_every_corner_desc:0 "If New Marelanders were trustworthy there would've been an active Thestreal minority prior to the ascension of Nightmare Moon. The situation for Thestreals here has been pitiful and none of these none-Thestreals can be trusted! To ensure obedience and loyalty amongst the population a Bat will be placed on every corner and the presence of Nightmare Moon's most loyal subjects shall be felt by all who'd have second thoughts."
 EQC_NLR_midnight_training_department:0 "Midnight Training Department"
 EQC_NLR_midnight_training_department_desc:0 "Bat ponies are adept hunters in the night, this has always been true. However the regular ponies of New Mareland are not proficient night fighters...with this in mind funds shall we set aside to set up large scale training centres purely for the purpose of teaching recruits how to properly fight and move in the dead of night. Regardless of who we recruit our armies will have the home field advantage in the darkness."
 EQC_NLR_figh_great_depression:0 "Fight Great Depression"
 EQC_NLR_figh_great_depression_desc:0 "Much like we fight the Sun and the fools who support it we too must fight against the ongoing economic depression that has plagued New Mareland for years by whatever means necessary. If this means sending her Majesty's subjects to unpaid overtime so be it. They should feel honoured to be under the Moon's guidance in the first place. The advancement of the Empire should be enough reward for these cretins."
 EQC_NLR_research_for_the_cause:0 "Research for the Cause"
 EQC_NLR_research_for_the_cause_desc:0 "Upon my arrival here research and development departments were in utter shambles between economic collapse and the rapid change of leadership from Celestial to Lunar control. Now that there is an ongoing war there can be no time for interruptions in the technological field. The brightest Thestreals must be called forth to research for the Moon's righteous cause against the Sun and all those that might stand in the way after."
 EQC_NLR_re-educate-sun-loyalists:0 "Reeducating Celestial Loyalists"
 EQC_NLR_re-educate-sun-loyalists_desc:0 "With Lunar control cemented over New Mareland there still exists many Celestial loyalists and it falls onto us to fix this for the sake of stability. It matters not how this is carried out be it with a whip or within a classroom. There can be no room for disobedience under her Majesty's guiding light and for that these dissidents will perish or be corrected no matter what."
 EQC_NLR_expand_bat_caves:0 "Expand the Bat Caves"
 EQC_NLR_expand_bat_caves_desc:0 "Bat pony caves in New Mareland have always been stunted growth-wise due to the relative lack of aid from the former Celestial Government. With this in mind I see no wrong in appropriating land from unreliable non-Thestreals and giving it to Thestreal communities for the sake of their continued growth. Bat pony population growth otherwise is far more important than anything else right now long-term speaking."
 EQC_NLR_recovering_economy:0 "The Recovering Economy"
 EQC_NLR_recovering_economy_desc:0 "Between outright brute-forcing the economy back into shape, establishing full control over the population, and finally ensuring the expedited growth of the next Thestreal generation which has ensured we shall have obedient workers and soldiers in the future, the economy is finally making a full recovery. Before long New Mareland will be in the position to become the jewel of the Lunar Empire it deserves to be."

 ### EVENTS ###
 EQC_NLR.1.t:0 "The Sunset Question"
 EQC_NLR.1.d:0 "We have secured the country at large and the time has come to wipe our territory clean of any vile Celestial titles. Where better to start with than our capital of course! Shall the capital's administration make ready to re-title itself to the proud city of Midnight?"
 EQC_NLR.1.a:0 "May we begin the course of annihilating any traces of the oppressive sun!"
 EQC_NLR.1.b:0 "Keeping the old name is a permanent reminder of our victory."
 
 EQC_NLR.2.t:0 "The Bats Come Out of Hiding"
 EQC_NLR.2.d:0 "As part of a National effort to begin the assimilation of non-Thestreals into Lunar society the so-called "Love a Bat Day" holiday was born. Conceptually speaking it remained difficult to convince formerly isolated and lonesome bat pony populations to come out into major population centres for the purpose of exposing themselves. It's fortunate non-Thestreals are easily befriended as the fluffy ears of our brothers and sisters were more than enough to woo the hearts of many ponies. "Love a Bat Day" has been a resounding success across the board, unity amongst our ranks will only improve from here now that Bats and non-Bats alike are commonly around one another."
 EQC_NLR.2.a:0 "Like stealing candy from a filly."
 
 EQC_NLR.3.t:0 "The Direction of our Society"
 EQC_NLR.3.d:0 "Her Majesty, Nightmare Moon, offered the Shadowbolt Society stewardship of New Mareland and after a near unanimous vote (under the watchful eye of Nightmare Moon herself), it was accepted. However, the society is split on how closely we follow the doctrine of our new Empress. Shall we fully embrace the darkness? Or shall we retain the New Mareland Spirit we were all borne with?\n\nWhatever we decide, we must do so soon, or risk ruin."
 EQC_NLR.3.a:0 "We need not soak ourselves in darkness to be followers of the Night. We shall pursue Neutrality."
 EQC_NLR.3.b:0 "The age of the Thestreal has begun, we must embrace the Dark as it has embraced us!"
 
 EQC_NLR.4.t:0 "The First Bat Appreciation Parade"
 EQC_NLR.4.d:0 "For the longest time in History, Bat ponies were seen as outsiders in Society, causing them to hide away in the Dark, cold Night. The recent changes of policy, however, provoked an obvious and quick change of this mentality. To further cement trust and unity between the different pony races, [Root.GetLeader] has decided to organise a grand Parade in Downtown New Manehattan, a 'Bat Appreciation Parade' as it is called. The Parade was filled with joy, and many ponies, including bat ponies, showed up to celebrate this historic day together."
 EQC_NLR.4.a:0 "Cheers on our new bat pony friends!"
 
 EQC_NLR.5.t:0 "The Sins of the Sun"
 EQC_NLR.5.d:0 "She is the one who raises the Sun, but also the one that banished our Queen for a thousand years out of lust for total power. This Beast basked in Glory and Recognition, leaving nothing to our poor Queen. And when she pleaded to receive her rightful recognition from both her Sister and her ponies, the Sister struck her down and banished her without hesitation. And now, a thousand years later, this Devil has continued on with her plot for total power and ignorance for her beloved Sister, our Queen. I ask you, is this a goddess that is rightful and spreads Harmony? Or is this a Demon whose words are foul and ignorant?"
 EQC_NLR.5.a:0 "Her ignorance will be her downfall!"
 
 EQC_NLR.6.t:0 "Equal Bat Rights"
 EQC_NLR.6.d:0 "Unicorns, Pegasi and Earth Ponies have lived together in harmony for years, yet the stigma against our Thestreal brethren remained. But recently these barriers have been broken down and bat ponies are being seen side-by-side with everypony. This harmonious co-existence is a brilliant sight to see, and only one more reason to finally introduce proper, legislative equal rights between the ponies and the bats. New Mareland will not exclude anypony, no matter their race. Together, we will prosper."
 EQC_NLR.6.a:0 "We stand united."
 
 EQC_NLR.7.t:0 "Shadowbolt Clubs"
 EQC_NLR.7.d:0 "This morning the Great Crystal Meetinghouse of the Shadowbolt Society opened its doors to the public for the first time. Ponies from all over the city marvelled at the grandeur of the Society’s most sacred of sanctums and ponies from all over the nation have been making enquiries as to how to join the Society. We have already spotted many potential candidates that would have gone under the radar otherwise. However, some of the Societies’ older members have voiced disagreements with this breach of our ancient codes."
 EQC_NLR.7.a:0 "To survive, we must grow."
 
 EQC_NLR.8.t:0 "The Magic of Midnight"
 EQC_NLR.8.d:0 "New Mareland is a loyal colony of the Lunar Empire; as such large bans on previously forbidden knowledge has been lifted. With a larger abundance of Unicorns in our ranks we can finally make use of magic at a grander scale. Truly...Midnight shall belong to us and us alone. No others may hope to stand against our might once the dreadful sun lowers."
 EQC_NLR.8.a:0 "When the clock strikes Midnight, the battlefield is ours!"
 
 EQC_NLR.9.t:0 "Lunar Conquest of Wingbardy"
 EQC_NLR.9.d:0 "Your subjects in New Mareland have steadily increased their arms production over the last few months. Initially viewed as perhaps dissension or preparations for a revolt an official letter from [Root.GetLeader] came today regarding the neighbouring Griffon nation of Wingbardy. [Root.GetLeader] has had reason to believe Wingbardy is a threat to the continued supremacy of the Night and the ponies of New Mareland as a whole."
 EQC_NLR.9.a:0 "Approve the request, let this be a test of their worth."
 EQC_NLR.9.b:0 "Waste of Imperial resources, I forbid it."
 
 EQC_NLR.10.t:0 "[From.GetName] agrees!"
 EQC_NLR.10.d:0 "With plenty of charm and just a bit of iffy wording, we have managed to persuade [From.GetLeader] of our request for War. Now, there is nothing standing between us and the Conquest of Wingbardy."
 EQC_NLR.10.a:0 "What are we waiting for?"
 
 EQC_NLR.11.t:0 "[From.GetName] refuses!"
 EQC_NLR.11.d:0 "Despite our obedience and fervent urging, [From.GetLeader] denied our request on going to war with Wingbardy. The homeland does not see any worth in spending Empire resources and ponypower on conquering a Griffon nation."
 EQC_NLR.11.a:0 "So, we're just gonna sit here?"
 
 EQC_NLR.12.t:0 "Daytime Curfews"
 EQC_NLR.12.d:0 "In an effort to increase support and recognition of our Queen, and to decrease the influence of the Day and the Sun on our lives, official Curfews have been proclaimed, prohibiting anypony or anygriff from leaving their homes after Sunrise. This is a rather drastic change to the lives of our citizens, but a necessary one."
 EQC_NLR.12.a:0 "Glory to the Night!"
 
 EQC_NLR.13.t:0 "Horrors of the Sun"
 EQC_NLR.13.d:0 "What has Celestia ever done for you? Has she not always ignored your every request? What has the Sun ever done for you but cause wildfires? What has the Day ever done to you except dictating your life? This, and much more, is what the Sun is guilty of. We refuse to worship a 'goddess' who would strike down and banish her own sister without hesitation! We refuse to pray to a pony that shows no interest in her subjects' well-being! We will not obey evil tyrants! Never!"
 EQC_NLR.13.a:0 "Down with the Sun!"
 
 EQC_NLR.14.t:0 "Mysterious Bats"
 EQC_NLR.14.d:0 "Marelanders have begun to talk among themselves about the intensified presence of bat ponies in dense urban centres. A sense of paranoia has developed as many have begun to feel they are being outright stalked by their Thestreal "
 EQC_NLR.14.a:0 "A Not-so-Secret Police."
 
 EQC_NLR.15.t:0 "All-Bat Divisions"
 EQC_NLR.15.d:0 "For many decades and centuries Thestreals have had limited activity in Equestrian armies. Normally clumped together with Pegasi regiments bat ponies have never once had the opportunity to form their own battalions outside of the night shift's Royal Guard. Now that Thestreals are nationally celebrated, encouraged, supported, and outright preferred even there is plenty reason to allow Divisions to exclusively consist of them. These new Thestreal divisions will be able to perform better in being able to get assigned to areas they hold much expertise in."
 EQC_NLR.15.a:0 "Give 'em Hell!"

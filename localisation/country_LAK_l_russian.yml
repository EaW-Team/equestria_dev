 ### Ideas ###
 LAK_dying_culture:0 "Ruiniad"
 LAK_dying_culture_desc:0 "Ruiniad or the Ruiniation is a term coined by Rumarean scholars to describe the gradual decline of the Rumarean language, culture and traditions.\n\nNo griffon is quite certain how or when it started, but the cultures more predominant in the Griffonian Empire have started to eclipse the native traditions. Some theorised this is due to immigration and simple convenience in international trade.  Regardless of the cause, the numbers speak for themselves, as barely 30% of Rumare's population still speak their native language. Even the most optimistic academics predict it is but matter of time until our culture goes truly extinct and the Ruiniad is complete."

 LAK_industry_technology_desc:0 "With our governmental issues sorted, we can now focus on modernising what little industry we have. Due to the relatively small size of our industrial sector that shouldn't pose such a big issue."
 LAK_resources:0 "The Spoils of Rumare"
 LAK_resources_desc:0 "While Rumare itself is not a large country there are still plenty of resources in our land that we can use to build up our economy."
 LAK_capitalists:0 "Support the Fisher Lords"
 LAK_capitalists_desc:0 "The Fishing industry is one of the most important industries on Rumare, employing a large amount of the population. However, in the recent years few citizens have managed to hoard the wealth of this industry for themselves. If we support these so called Fisher Lords, we can expect a increase in industrial efficiency, and productivity. But, supporting the Fisher Lords will annoy quite a bit of the population."
 LAK_airport:0 "The Rumare National Airport"
 LAK_airport_desc:0 "Due to being surrounded on all sides by larger nations, land trade is simply not an option. However, the recent development of aviation provides us with an interesting alternative for transporting goods."

 LAK_unions:0 "Support the Fisher Unions"
 LAK_unions_desc:0 "The Fishing industry is one of the most important industries on Rumare, employing a large amount of the population. However, in the recent years few citizens have managed to hoard the wealth of this industry for themselves. This has led to a divide between those profiting off the industry, and those actually working in it, leading to the creation of several Fisher Unions. We should support these Unions."
 LAK_industry_2:0 "Expand the Industrial Sector"
 LAK_industry_2_desc:0 "Our industry is booming, and our wealth increasing by the day. We should invest our newfound wealth back into the economy."
 LAK_industry_3:0 "An Arms Industry"

 LAK_good_economy:0 "A Model of Stability"
 LAK_good_economy_desc:0 "The Rumare economic model is known far and wide as a model of stability, reliability and other fancy words ending with -ity. This is allowing us to attract many investors both from Griffonia and abroad."
 
 LAK_army_reform:0 "An Army for Rumare"
 LAK_army_reform_desc:0 "Surrounded on all sides with the Empire to the North and Wingbardy to the South, it is time to reform Rumare's army. The Baron has begun this by recalling his old Mercenary advisors, to begin reshaping the national army- or what’s left of it."
 LAK_grand_plan:0 "Dig in and Pray"
 LAK_grand_plan_desc:0 "We can only hope to weather the coming storm by digging our fortifications so deep within our lake-central citadel, that our foes dare not march a single step into our land. Every inch of our island shall be a fortress unto itself."
 LAK_superior:0 "Man the Cannons"
 LAK_superior_desc:0 "We shall defend our island against any and all invaders, by overwhelming them with firepower. Our cannon fire will be so strong in volume that it will blot out the sun from the sky, invisible for the shells that we launch at our enemies. They’ll be foolish to even dare advance upon us, for fear of being erased from the ground they stand upon."
 LAK_modern_rifles:0 "New Rifles"
 LAK_modern_rifles_desc:0 "With our own rifles beginning to fall into the problem of being outdated, we must strive to keep our weaponry on the bleeding edge of technology. New model rifles and soldier’s gear is of utmost importance."
 LAK_artillery_f:0 "Modern Artillery"
 LAK_artillery_f_desc:0 "Our original cannons were good in their heyday, but it has come time to modernise and improve upon their designs. New types of artillery, such as the mortar and the howitzer, are massive improvements to our old model guns."
 LAK_import_guns:0 "Connections"
 LAK_import_guns_desc:0 "The Baron, upon reorganising the military, happened to stumble upon some old contacts from across the shattered Empire, that happened to have access to new and shiny rifles from the finest forge smiths the Empire had ever seen. Clearly, it’s time to speak with those contacts about... certain matters of arsenal filling."
 LAK_forts:0 "Fortification Effort"
 LAK_forts_desc:0 "We should begin fortification efforts immediately, whether or not we are on the precipice of war, or the beginning of a fifty-year peace. We must prepare for the worst, and plan for such- and then hope for the best."
 LAK_support_equipment:0 "Organise Support Squads"
 LAK_support_equipment_desc:0 "We must begin to add supporting squads to our frontline combatants- those that don’t see front line service; the army doctors, supply officers, reconnaissance units, and the like. These units will help to keep our frontline units focused on the battle, and in good supply and health."
 LAK_friends:0 "Old Friends"
 LAK_friends_desc:0 "The Baron has decided to contact more of his old friends, to fill up ranks of the military, recruit new soldiers, and to help organise the army’s general staff itself."
 LAK_military_academy:0 "Invite Foreign Military Engineers"
 LAK_military_academy_desc:0 "We must find bright and new minds to keep our forces modernised and in tip-top shape. The Baron is prepared to deal, Diplomacise, kidnap, and bribe whomever he is able to find and secure for the Barony."
 
 LAK_airforce:0 "Establish the RAF"
 LAK_airforce_desc:0 "The time has come to establish the Rumaran Air Force. The invention of the airplane has changed many things when it comes to Aerial combat, and we must keep up with the times."
 LAK_fighters:0 "Prioritise Fighters"
 LAK_fighters_desc:0 "We must focus on building fighters. The victory in the skies depends on ruling them with high-tech, advanced fighters, capable of outperforming our various enemies."
 LAK_close_air_support:0 "Support Our Troops"
 LAK_close_air_support_desc:0 "Continuing down our focus on ruling the skies, we should focus on producing dedicated fighter planes capable of supporting our ground operations with Close Air Support; Localised short range bombers that can rapidly react to the changing fight on the ground."
 LAK_bombers:0 "Prioritise Bombers"
 LAK_bombers_desc:0 "We must focus on building bombers. By bombing our enemies into submission, we will bring ruination upon our enemies, destroying their factories and city centres."
 LAK_strategic_bomber:0 "Strategic Destruction"
 LAK_strategic_bomber_desc:0 "We must continue to expand our doctrine of destroying enemy factories and city centres. As such, we must develop a dedicated long range bomber to conduct this type of battle- a bomber capable of both travelling far abroad, and carrying massive payloads of explosives."
 LAK_expand_airports:0 "Expand Our Airfields"
 LAK_expand_airports_desc:0 "It is time to enlarge our airfields to accommodate our new airplane models, as we are rapidly running out of runway space. Specially dedicated areas for airplanes shall be set aside, and land cleared and raised or lowered as necessary."
 LAK_air_doctrine_f:0 "Our Own Doctrine"
 LAK_air_doctrine_f_desc:0 "The time has come to truly establish our own air doctrine that we may call our own. Presented with three different opportunities, we must decide upon a specific doctrine to push forward to the Baron."
 LAK_jets:0 "Piercing the Speed of Sound"
 LAK_jets_desc:0 "New scientists from around the world have reported fighter planes on the other continent across the pond, as it were, capable of penetrating the sound barrier. The idea itself will be quite a headache to wrap our heads around, but the Baron has insisted that our brightest minds begin looking into this "rocketry" that the news has spoken of."
 LAK_radar:0 "RADAR Technology"
 LAK_radar_desc:0 "Capable of tracking an aeroplane long before visible contact, RADAR may be cutting edge technology, but we would be foolish not to make use of it. The Baron has already ordered us to begin development of our own RADAR systems, and as such, we must hurry to finalise designs."
 
 LAK_naval_base:0 "Establish the RN"
 LAK_naval_base_desc:0 "We must make strides to modernise our small fledgling navy. With onset war coming on the horizon, we need a good way to defend our lake, making it impossible to cross by enemy forces. Establishing a Modern Rumaran Navy is an excellent first step in this process."
 LAK_flexible_navy:0 "A Small Fleet"
 LAK_flexible_navy_desc:0 "Because our Lake itself is quite small, our navy as well should match it, as we have no need for massive battleships and outdated battlecruisers. Instead, we should focus on smaller craft, such as "submarines"- special craft capable of submerging below the water, and cruiser-sized vessels."
 LAK_submarines:0 "Lake Sharks"
 LAK_submarines_desc:0 "We should capitalise on our advances in modern naval vessels to produce these new submarines our engineers have been drafting. Practically invisible to surface craft, we can easily defend our waters from the safety of the lake’s depths."
 LAK_destroyers:0 "Trade Escorts"
 LAK_destroyers_desc:0 "We should capitalise on our advances in modern naval vessels to improve our trade escort vessels, both to defend our trade convoys, and by extension, patrol the waters of our lake, and keep them clear of any enemy vessels or troops."
 LAK_amphibious:0 "Amphibious Assault"
 LAK_amphibious_desc:0 "We must prepare for the eventuality that we may need to transport troops across our lake, without the use of a land bridge, and under enemy fire. As such, we must develop specialised craft to keep our soldiers safe, and to transport them to any enemy beaches that are required."
 LAK_lake_control:0 "Dominate the Lake"
 LAK_lake_control_desc:0 "It is time to secure our Naval Victory for good. More Ships must be built in better dockyards, and our doctrine itself must be refined to such perfection that no vessel dares to enter our lake without our permission."

 cityfall.1.t:0 "The Fall of Vaverfront"
 cityfall.1.d:0 "Reports from early this morning tell of Changeling forces overrunning the Oleanian city of Vaverfront, clearing out the last defenders desperately holding on to the city's port.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Olenian civilians have been pouring out of the city by hoof or by ship, though it was too late for many as Changeling tanks caught up to them and blocked off every escape route.\n\nThe city, once a hotspot of radio traffic, has now gone eerily silent, with only celebratory music and speeches being transmitted by the occupying Changeling forces in the city."
 cityfall.1.a:0 "The Changelings are advancing..."
 cityfall.1.b:0 "This is just the beginning."
 cityfall.1.c:0 "We will avenge Vaverfront!"

 cityfall.2.t:0 "The Fall of Hjortland"
 cityfall.2.d:0 "Changeling forces have overwhelmed the last Olenian defenders in the capital of Hjortland. After infiltrating the ranks of the defenders, the changelings launched a surprise attack from without and within, quickly crushing any semblance of an organised defence. The last defenders retreated to the Hjortland palace, but their stalwart defense was no match to the elite Jagers units that assaulted the historic building.\n\nThe Changeling banner now flies from the ruins of the Riksdag as the surviving Olenian soldiers surrender to the victorious Changelings."
 cityfall.2.a:0 "The Olenians gave it their all."
 cityfall.2.b:0 "A great victory!"
 cityfall.2.c:0 "Is this the end?"

 cityfall.3.t:0 "The Fall of Cervus"
 cityfall.3.d:0 "Fighting has drawn to a close in the Olenian city of Cervus as changeling forces clear out the last defenders hiding within the city's abandoned factories and apartment blocks. After heavy bombing by air and artillery, Changeling tanks broke through the impromptu barricades and sped through the streets to secure the docks and rail depot.\n\nWhat few Olenian defenders that remained were unable to evacuate due to the lightning-speed of the Changeling advance. As of this morning, Cervus is now officially under Changeling occupation."
 cityfall.3.a:0 "Is there no stopping the Changelings?"
 cityfall.3.b:0 "They were no match for us."
 cityfall.3.c:0 "We will come back for Cervus!"

 cityfall.4.t:0 "The Fall of Sakara"
 cityfall.4.d:0 "All effective resistance in the Olenian city of Sakara ended this morning after Changeling forces rushed the city hall and captured the Olenians' Sakaran Headquarters. A fire, possibly set by the retreating Olenian forces, ravaged the wooden city, forcing the invading Changelings to focus on putting out the fires.\n\nThe fires are out, but they have dealt a terrible toll in collateral damage and civilian casualties. Changeling stations have announced that the Olenian government is to blame for the tragedy, and that military field hospitals have been set up for the wounded."
 cityfall.4.a:0 "The Olenians are getting desperate."
 cityfall.4.b:0 "What a waste of life."
 cityfall.4.c:0 "Hopefully that bought us some time."

 cityfall.5.t:0 "The Fall of River City"
 cityfall.5.d:0 "The brutal street-to-street fighting in the [old_controller.GetAdjective] capital of River City has come to an end in the early hours of the morning.\n\nDespite blowing many of the city's famed bridges the defenders where unable to stop [new_controller.GetAdjective] troops from crossing the Savha and Green Rivers. After fighting for every street and house, the defenders where pushed back to the citadel on Green Hill and running out of supplies, the [old_controller.GetAdjective] commander order a breakout of the city under the cover of night and the thick fog, taking as many civilians as they could with them. However, they were spotted and came under heavy fire. The last defenders fought until the end to protect the retreating civilians."
 cityfall.5.a:0 "One city does not make a Federation!"
 cityfall.5.b:0 "The heart of the Riverlands is now ours."
 cityfall.5.c:0 "The sun begins to set on the eastern ponies."

 cityfall.6.t:0 "The Fall of Sunset"
 cityfall.6.d.maresoc_take:0 "Fighting in the New Mareland capital of Sunset has come to the end as the fanatical MARESOC militia captured the final defenders. Shocked citizens looked on as members of government, business owners, soldiers and police officers where marched to Long Bay Prison. The flag of the MARESOC party flies over the Commonwealth Congress and rallies have been heled among the ruins offering pardons to anyone who swears their allegiance to the MARESOC party. It is unsure of what fate awaits those who continue to resist."
 cityfall.6.d.maresoc_loose:0 "The city of Sunset is unrecognisable to those who knew it before MARESOC's rule. The towering monoliths that where the Ministries of Truth, Plenty and Peace had been demolished by MARESOC forces, seemingly whipping away all trace that they were ever there. The rest of the city hadn't fared much better. The scorched-earth tactics employed by the defenders have left most of the city in ruins. The residents of the tightly packed slums eagerly partake in this destruction of their own homes before throwing themselves at the advancing [new_controller.GetAdjective] forces with sharpened sticks and clubs.\n\nOnly the Ministry of Love remains. A seemingly impenetrable bunker that constant artillery barrages and [new_controller.GetAdjective] engineers have been unable to crack. Nonmatter what is behind the magically-sealed doors, it is in little position to control the ruins of the once great city."
 cityfall.6.d.other:0 "Fighting has come to an end in the city of Sunset as the last of the [old_controller.GetAdjective] defenders surrendered on the steps of the opera house. The building itself had been gutted by fires caused by [new_controller.GetAdjective] artillery barrages. The Sunset Harbour Bridge remained intact as the [old_controller.GetAdjective] forces couldn't bring themselves to destroy the iconic symbol of the city.\n\nThe [new_controller.GetAdjective] flag now flies from the top of the bridge's archway, letting all know who now controls the city."
 cityfall.6.a.maresoc_take:0 "The madness of MARESOC cannot be allowed to win!"
 cityfall.6.a.maresoc_loose:0 "They can have the ashes."
 cityfall.6.a:0 "Give it time and the sun will rise over Sunset once again."
 cityfall.6.b.maresoc_take:0 "This is a great victory for the party."
 cityfall.6.b.maresoc_loose:0 "The corruption of MARESOC is washing away."
 cityfall.6.b:0 "Time to have a barby on the beach."
 cityfall.6.c.maresoc_take:0 "And thus darkness falls over New Mareland."
 cityfall.6.c.maresoc_loose:0 "The sun rises over Sunset once again."
 cityfall.6.c:0 "With the end of Sunset, darkness has fallen over New Mareland."

 pony_race_trait:0 "Pony"
 pony_race_trait_desc:0 "Ponies are small, colourful and sentient equines. The term "pony" traditionally encompasses three subgroups which are the earth ponies, the pegasi and the unicorns. Earth ponies are characterized by their sturdier physic. The pegasi are somewhat lighter than their earthbound cousins and have a pair of wings that allows them to fly. The unicorns are also lighter but have a distinctive horn on their forehead which allows them to practice magic and use spells. An extremely rare subgroup called the Alicorns have features of all three: strong physique, wings and a magical horn. Finally, every pony has a cutie mark, a magical symbol upon their flanks that appears during the latter phase of their development. The cutie mark is a not well-understood phenomenon and illustrates a special talent or personality trait of the pony who bears it. It has therefore a significant cultural importance to many pony societies throughout the world."

They have the ability to see in the dark but have no magical abilities beyond those of earth ponies and pegasi. While it is not an absolute rule, many thestrals behave as nocturnal creatures. They are sometimes called bats, even among themselves though it is sometimes seen as derogatory compared to the more neutral term of thestral, and has historically been associated to the figure of Nightmare Moon, though the truth is much more complex."
 zebra_race_trait:0 "Zebra"
 zebra_race_trait_desc:0 "The Zebras are equids similar to earth ponies but recognizable to their striped black and white coat. Their flanks bear cutie marks. They have magical abilities but most of their magical practices involve the craft and use of potions and magical items. Unlike their pony cousins, zebras tend to live in more arid climates."
 penguin_race_trait:0 "Penguin"
 penguin_race_trait_desc:0 "The Penguins are a sapient species of small bipedal aquatic flightless avians. They have a wide array of physical appearances as several types of penguins exist.

They have no known innate magical abilities but are capable of wielding magical items."
 bear_race_trait:0 "Bear"
 bear_race_trait_desc:0 "The Bears are large sapient mammal creatures known for their large size, powerful claws and lush fur. They have no magical abilities to speak of. While they appear friendly and to some cuddly, they can have quite the temper and are among the most ferocious opponents one can find. And remember: only you can prevent forest fires."
 changeling_race_trait:0 "Changeling"
 changeling_race_trait_desc:0 "The Changelings are a sapient species of pony-like insectoids. They have insect-like wings in their back and are capable of flight. However, their most recognizable feature is their magical ability to shift their form, voice and even size to a minor degree in near-instantaneous speed. They are capable of magically draining the emotion of love felt by other species and to feed upon it. While they are able to survive without it, feeding on love allows them to feel and perform better and shapeshift for longer periods than they would otherwise. These abilities have gave them a rather sinister reputation among other species, particularly as many are willing to use aggressive means to obtain love."
 griffon_race_trait:0 "Griffon"
 griffon_race_trait_desc:0 "Griffons are sapient colourful creatures who are half avian and half feline. They have six limbs: two avian-like arms with claws, two feline-like back legs with paws and two wings on their back. Thanks to their wings they are able to fly, which makes traversing rough terrain easy for them. They are also known to be relatively strong creatures but lack significant magical capabilities as they are only capable of enchantments and incantations. They are said to be a greedy and gold-obsessed species but this is just a lie invented by insolvent debtors."
 yak_race_trait:0 "Yak"
 yak_race_trait_desc:0 "The Yaks are large sapientt quadrupedal mammals, recognizable by their thick coat and large horns.

 deer_race_trait:0 "Deer"
 deer_race_trait_desc:0 "The Deer are small sapient quadrupedal mammals. They are recognizable by their colourful antlers and sometimes thick patches of fur around their neck.

Despite having no particular abilities in aquatic environment, the deers are renowned seafarers."
 diamond_dog_race_trait:0 "Diamond Dog"
 diamond_dog_race_trait_desc:0 "Diamond Dogs are sapient canine creatures capable of bipedal movement. They can see well in the dark and prefer to live underground. Thanks to their powerful digging claws, they are able to extract resources and dig tunnels with ease. They have no magical abilities whatsoever but most dog societies have a great expertise with the mundane aspects of crystals."
 minotaur_race_trait:0 "Minotaur"
 minotaur_race_trait_desc:0 "Minotaurs are sapient creatures who have the head and lower half of a bovine and the torso and arms of a primate. They are known to be strong but lack magical abilities, which they make up for with their dexterous multi-fingered appendages. Unlike most other sapient races, they are exclusively bipedal, which also makes them much taller."
 undead_race_trait:0 "Undead"
 undead_race_trait_desc:0 "The undead are usually animated magical creatures, made from the remains of creatures infused with forbidden magic, and can therefore take a wide array of forms. However, other forms of unlife exist thanks to the twisted imagination of our world's necromancers."
 buffalo_race_trait:0 "Buffalo"
 buffalo_race_trait_desc:0 "The Buffalo are sapient quadrupedal mammals known for their very large size, sturdy bodies and horns. They are very well-adapted to arid environments. Despite their large bodies, they are exceptionally fast and strong enough to withstand a direct frontal hit, making them able to effectively charge at any threat. They have no known magical abilities."
 dragon_race_trait:0 "Dragon"
 dragon_race_trait_desc:0 "Dragons are colourful, sapient, fire-breathing winged lizards. They vary dramatically in size depending on their age, with young adults being similar in size to a griffon or pony. The largest and oldest known dragons can be several stories high. Dragons are a mostly solitary species and are often seen as dangerous and awe-inspiring by the other species who usually fear them. Dragons have magical abilities, consume crystals to sustain themselves and are known to have a nearly physical need to gather "hoards" of precious goods though it may simply be a romanticized interpretation of their physical need of crystals to live."
 camel_race_trait:0 "Camel"
 camel_race_trait_desc:0 "Camels are hardy quadrupedal mammals who live in the most extreme of arid landscapes. The distinct humps on their backs are crucial to their ability to survive for long periods without food or water. As such, they have developed a history and tradition of nomads, though many have become settled. They are thus often the only sapient creatures who can regularly and safely travel and live within the harshest deserts."
 cat_race_trait:0 "Cat"
 cat_race_trait_desc:0 "Bipedal by nature, these feline creatures have developed differently from their more feral kin and have grown sapient as a result. Cats are renowned for their wit and penchant for trading; however, their historical institution of the enslavement of non-cat creatures has sullied their reputation abroad, and are seen as two-faced schemers."
 centaur_race_trait:0 "Centaur"
 centaur_race_trait_desc:0 "Anatomically speaking, Centaurs are strange creatures: their lower body is almost that of an enlarged pony, but their upper body is a peculiar mix of bovine and caprine, and they lack a complete coating of fur. Bulging with red muscles and gifted with some magical ability, Centaurs are renowned for their martial skill and athleticism. Historically tied with Gargoyles, interspecies marriages between Centaurs and Gargoyles are commonplace."

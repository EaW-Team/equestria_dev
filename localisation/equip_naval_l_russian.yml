 heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Washington Naval Treaty was set up to prevent an arms race in cruisers, among other ships, but this seems inevitable. By keeping armor light, the weapons load can be increased."
 heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Despite new efforts at treaties, refitting lighter cruisers with heavier weaponry remains efficient, although armor is still limited."
 heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "As restrictions are increasingly ignored worldwide, more balanced heavy cruiser designs with more priority on armor can be built. Better anti-air guns allow these ships to cooperate in naval air warfare."

 ENG_submarine_1:0 "L Class"
 ENG_submarine_1_desc:0 "The L-class were medium sized boats originally planned under the Emergency War Program as an improved version of the previous submarine classes. They were built in the late stages of World War I and were equipped with new, larger 21 in. torpedoes. They served until the beginning of World War II when they were mostly used for secondary and training duties."
 #ENG_submarine_1b: "O/P/R Class"
 #ENG_submarine_1c: "S Class"
 ENG_submarine_2:0 "T Class"
 ENG_submarine_2_desc:0 "The To-class or Triton-class boats were designed to replace the O, P, and R class large submarines. They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. These boats were well-armed, stable platforms and were used extensively during the conflict, as 25 percent of the constructed boats were lost during the war."
 ENG_submarine_3:0 "U Class"
 ENG_submarine_3_desc:0 "The U class were small-sized submarines built under the War Emergency 1940 and 1941 Programs. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the class: Undine, Umpire and Uproar."
 #ENG_submarine_3b: "Seraph Class"
 ENG_submarine_4:0 "V Class"
 ENG_submarine_4_desc:0 "The V-class or Vampire-class submarines were based on the previous U-class smaller sized boats. They were larger but still relatively small, with better seagoing ability but limited operational range and weaponry."
 #ENG_submarine_4b: "Amphion Class"
 ENG_destroyer_1:0 "V/W Class"
 ENG_destroyer_1_desc:0 "These destroyers included the Admirality and Thornycroft V and W classes. They were built under the War Emergency Program. They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First World War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WWI and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, used eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
 #ENG_destroyer_1b: "A/B/C/D Class"
 ENG_destroyer_2:0 "G/H/I Class"
 ENG_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The G, H, and I class destroyers were ordered as part of the 1933 and 1934 Naval Construction Programs. They were generally repeats of the preceding F class, with a slight reduction in size. Armament in the G and H classes is the same as in the F class, with both using the 4.7 in. guns. These ships had long range, were adequately armed, and had a strong torpedo complement. They were used extensively during the war and suffered numerous losses."
 #ENG_destroyer_2b: "Tribal Class"
 ENG_destroyer_3:0 "J/K/N Class"
 ENG_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The J, K, and N classes were similar to the earlier Tribal class but rather than emphasizing gun armament, the designers returned to a more standard heavy torpedo and lighter gun setup. The ships were modified throughout their wartime service. Upgrades included improved anti-aircraft guns and radar. They were fast, long-ranged and well-armed vessels ideal for fleet escorts."
 ENG_destroyer_4:0 "Battle Class"
 ENG_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Battle class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programs. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels. Their late introduction to the war led to a minimal contribution."
 #ENG_destroyer_4b: "Weapon Class"
 ENG_light_cruiser_1:0 "C Class"
 ENG_light_cruiser_1_desc:1 "C-class light cruisers were a group of light cruisers built before and during the First World War for the rough conditions of the North Sea. They proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load to finish off enemy vessels and convoys. They saw extensive use during WWI and participated in many surface actions."
 #ENG_light_cruiser_1b: "Emerald Class"
 #ENG_light_cruiser_1c: "Amphion Class"
 ENG_light_cruiser_2:0 "Southampton Class"
 ENG_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Southampton-class light cruisers were a subclass of the Town-class cruisers and were designed to counter the Japanese Mogami-class cruisers. These vessels were well-armored, had good speed and range, and carried a formidable armament of twelve 6 in. guns in four triple turrets. They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."
 #ENG_light_cruiser_2b: "Edinburgh Class"
 ENG_light_cruiser_3:0 "Crown Colony Class"
 ENG_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Crown Colony-class light cruisers were improved versions of the earlier Town class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armored but because of their smaller engines, their range is somewhat reduced. The type included two subclasses: Fiji and Ceylon."
 #ENG_light_cruiser_3b: "Dido Class"
 ENG_light_cruiser_4:0 "Minotaur Class"
 ENG_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Also known as the Swiftsure class, these cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Crown Colony class, incorporating war modifications that were authorized in 1941. They had a longer operational range and more numerous AA weaponry than the Crown Colony class, while the main armament was reduced to three triple turrets. Built too late to affect the outcome of the war, most of the ordered vessels were cancelled afterwards. "
 ENG_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Hawkins Class"
 ENG_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Hawkins-class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armor belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection. Altogether, five ships were commissioned but only four were active at the start of WWII."
 #ENG_heavy_cruiser_1b: "County Class"
 ENG_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Surrey Class"
 ENG_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Program. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they had been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armor, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 ENG_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Class"
 ENG_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 ENG_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Churchill Design"
 ENG_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "These ships were proposed by Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admirality, in the early stages of WWII to counter the German Deutschland class big gun cruisers. These vessels had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armor. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships. The ships were eventually cancelled because of high costs and a lack of demand for a new heavy cruiser. "
 ENG_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Renown Class"
 ENG_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WWI. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armor and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."
 #ENG_battle_cruiser_1b: "Admiral Class"
 ENG_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Princess Royal Class"
 ENG_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal is a class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 ENG_battleship_1:1 "Revenge Class"
 ENG_battleship_1_desc:1 "The Revenge-class battleships were ordered in 1913 as cheap versions of the Queen Elizabeth-class fast dreadnoughts. While similarly armed and armored, their considerably lower speed relegated them to secondary duties during WWII. Of the envisioned 8 ships of the class, only 5 were finished."
 #ENG_battleship_1b: "Nelson Class"
 ENG_battleship_2:0 "King George V Class"
 ENG_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 ENG_battleship_3:0 "Lion Class"
 ENG_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have had thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 ENG_battleship_4:0 "Vanguard Class"
 ENG_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Vanguard-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theater. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Program, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament is the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armor made the vessel fast and well protected."
 ENG_SH_battleship_1:0 "Centurion Class"
 ENG_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion is a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 ENG_SH_battleship_2:0 "Lion II Class"
 ENG_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 ENG_carrier_1:0 "Courageous Class"
 ENG_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement is limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 ENG_carrier_2:0 "Ark Royal Class"
 ENG_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She is the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel is well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 ENG_carrier_3:0 "Illustrious Class"
 ENG_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Illustrious class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armored flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."
 ENG_carrier_4:0 "Implacable Class"
 ENG_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Implacable-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Program and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armor on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious class."
 #ENG_carrier_4b: "Malta Class"
 ### FRA - FRANCE ###
 FRA_submarine_1:0 "600 Series"
 FRA_submarine_1_desc:0 "The 600-ton Series of submarines were France's first modern post WWI submarines. They were medium sized, displacing around 600tons. Though they were seagoing ones, they were designated as coastal submarines and used mostly in warm waters of the Mediterranean. Three classes of 4 ships each built of this type: Sirène, Ariane and Circé classes. They were the basis of the bigger 630-ton Series the Argonaute, Diane and Orion classes."
 #FRA_submarine_1b: "630 Series"
 #FRA_submarine_1c: "Redoutable Class"
 FRA_submarine_2:0 "Minerve Class"
 FRA_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Minerve-class submarines (project name T2) were based on the 630-ton Series though they had better engines and different torpedo layout. These submarines were the first part of the standardization program resulting of a centralized design of the DCAN (Direction des Constructions et Armes Navale) rather than shipyard specific designs of the previous classes."
 #FRA_submarine_2b: "Aurore Class"
 FRA_submarine_3:0 "Roland Morillot Class"
 FRA_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Roland Morillot-class submarines (Project name Z2) were large ocean going submarines based on the earlier Redoubtable-class submarines. They were large submarines displacing 1,800-2,400 tons and carried a formidable armament of 10 torpedo tubes. The Fall of France occurred before any were finished."
 FRA_submarine_4:0 "Phénix Class"
 FRA_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Phénix-class submarines were medium sized ocean-going and long range boats authorized in the 1939-40 naval programs but the start of the war and the Fall of France resulted in the cancellation of these boats. They were similar to the Redoutable class though they were smaller and displaced 1,200 tons. They carried a similarly heavy torpedo armament."
 FRA_destroyer_1:0 "Bourrasque Class"
 FRA_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Bourrasque-class destroyers were part of the 1,500-ton Series, and launched in the mid 1920's. Together with the preceding Chacal and following L'Adroit classes, they were the backbone of the new modern post war French fleet. They were fast and well-armed for their time, but their torpedo armament is smaller compared to similar vessels in the other navies."
 #FRA_destroyer_1b: "Chacal Class"
 #FRA_destroyer_1c: "Aigle & Vauquelin Class"
 FRA_destroyer_2:0 "Le Fantasque Class"
 FRA_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Le Fantasque-class destroyers were essentially improved versions of the earlier super destroyers of the 2,400-ton Series (Guépard, Aigle, Vauquelin) built under the 1930 naval program. They were large, heavily-armed, and very fast destroyers, perfect for escorting the new high speed units of the French fleet. Their armament consisted of newly developed guns, adequate AA, and torpedo armament."
 #FRA_destroyer_2b: "Le Hardi Class"
 #FRA_destroyer_2c: "Mogador Class"
 FRA_destroyer_3:0 "L'Intrépide Class"
 FRA_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The L'Intrépide-class destroyers ware a modified version of the earlier Le Hardi class destroyers. They were authorized in the 1938 and 1939 naval programs but the war and Fall of France resulted in the cancellation of these vessels. They would have been focused more on an anti-aircraft role, and had an increase in displacement to 2,800-2,900 tons had larger engines."
 FRA_destroyer_4:0 "Hoche Class"
 FRA_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Hoche and Bayard classes were the final super destroyer design of the French Navy. Both classes were based on the Mogador class, displacing 4,200 tons with a similar main armament but improved AA guns and stronger engines. They were authorized in the 1939-40 naval programs but the start of the war and the Fall of France resulted in the cancellation of these ships."
 FRA_light_cruiser_1:0 "Duguay-Trouin Class"
 FRA_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Duguay-Trouin light cruisers were the first major French warships built after World War I in the 1922 naval program. They became the first light cruisers with super-firing enclosed main turrets. Among light cruisers, they had a strong torpedo armament but virtually nonexistent armor."
 FRA_light_cruiser_2:0 "La Galissonnière Class"
 FRA_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The La Galissonnière-class light cruisers were the answer to the Italian Condottieri type light cruisers and were based on the previous Emile Bertin class. They were built in the 1931 and 1932 naval programs, with typical main armament and adequate AA armament of the era. They displaced 10,850 tons, had an increased amount of scout planes, and had good speed."
 FRA_light_cruiser_3:0 "De Grasse Class"
 FRA_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The DeGrasse-class cruisers were authorized in the 1938 and 1939 naval programs and were essentially improved La Galissonnières. They had stronger AA armament as well as bigger engines. The Fall of France caused the last two ships to be cancelled and the lead ship to be finished post-war as a different design. The Germans intended to finish her as a light carrier but this project was also not carried out."
 FRA_light_cruiser_4:0 "Colbert Class"
 FRA_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Colbert was an anti-aircraft light cruiser launched in 1956. This Colbert-class cruiser was built in a very similar way to the post-war De Grasse, featuring heavy AA armament both for long and short ranges. The difference between Colbert and DeGrasse is that the Colbert had smaller engines, thinner armor, and was slightly smaller."
 FRA_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Suffren Class"
 FRA_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Suffren-class heavy cruisers were basically a repeat of the previous Duquesne class with minor improvements regarding its seagoing abilities. Both classes resembled the contemporary cruiser philosophy of the French navy; very thin armor but good speed and range. Their standard displacement is 10,000 tons and they were equipped with armaments that were standard for a heavy cruiser."
 FRA_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Algérie Class"
 FRA_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Algérie-class heavy cruiser were a further improvement of the previous classes of the Suffren and Duquesne but designed to be the opponent of the new Italian heavy cruisers of the Zara class. Both the main armor belt and underwater protection is considerably increased. Its AA armament is adequate for its time, but due to these changes, the standard displacement is over 10,000 tons."
 FRA_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Saint Louis Class"
 FRA_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Saint Louis-class heavy cruisers were based on the Algérie class but the overall look was closer to that of the Dunkerque and Richelieu class capital ships. Three ships were ordered in the 1940 naval program, but due to the Fall of France none of them were laid down. They would field new guns and improved AA armament but the armor would be the same as on the Algérie class. It was the last heavy cruiser design of the French Navy."
 FRA_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Forbin Class"
 FRA_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Forbin-class heavy cruisers were a hypothetical design as a follow up of the Saint Louis class. Designed to defend the trade lanes between Mainland France and the colonies, it had long range and good speed along with a heavy armament of guns in four triple turrets and an adequate number of AA weaponry. The ship layout and general look resembled an influence from the previous Saint Louis class as well as British Crown Colony class."
 FRA_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Durand-Viel Design"
 FRA_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Durand-Viel design of battlecruiser was a proposal among a series of studies dating back to WWI. They were essentially the battlecruiser versions of the Normandie and Lyon classes of battleship featuring the same quad turrets and guns though in reduced number. Like contemporary battlecruisers of other navies, they would be faster but less armored than a battleship. They were cancelled before WWI broke out."
 FRA_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Dunkerque Class"
 FRA_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Dunkerques were designed to counter the German Deutschland-class pocket battleships. They were the apex of a series design studies from the mid 1920's to early 1930's. Authorized in the 1931 and 1934 naval programs, they were similar to the British Nelson-class battleships, with all of their main turrets concentrated forward. This resulted in a shorter belt armor and thus a smaller ship to fit into the Naval Treaties limitations."
 FRA_battleship_1:0 "Courbet Class"
 FRA_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Courbet-class battleships were the first super-dreadnoughts built for the French Navy before and during the First World War. Authorized in the 1910 and 1911 naval programs, they saw limited service during World War I, but were active during WW2. Though they had thicker armor and stronger guns than the previous Dante class battleships, they were still inferior to contemporary USN and RN battleships. They displaced just over 22,000 tons and their only modernizations before WW2 were an improved AA armament and improved boilers."
 #FRA_battleship_1b: "Bretagne Class" 
 FRA_battleship_2:0 "Richelieu Class"
 FRA_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Richelieu-class battleships were the last battleships commissioned into the French Navy. They were an improved design of the Dunkerque and authorized under the 1935 and 1938 naval programs. They had excellent AA armament, speed and range, which made it an excellent capital ship. Out of the four ordered, only two were launched and one was completed before the Fall of France. There were numerous attempts to finish the remaining ships using different designs, proposed for use as anti-aircraft battleships, battleship-carrier hybrids, or full scale carriers."
 FRA_battleship_3:0 "Gascogne Class"
 FRA_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Gascogne class of battleships were a subclass of the Richelieu class. Three ships were ordered in the 1940 naval program but none were started. The design would be a repeat of the Richelieu, but with the main armament distributed evenly fore and aft, improved AA Armament, and improved engines resulting in an overall better ship."
 FRA_battleship_4:0 "Alsace Class"
 FRA_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Alsace-class battleships were planned to succeed the Richelieu class. Four ships were ordered, with the design studies finished in 1939, authorized in 1940, and expected to be laid down in 1941, though the Fall of France prevented this from happening. It improves upon the Richelieu design with heavier and more numerous main guns, stronger AA armament, thicker armor plates, and larger engines."
 FRA_SH_battleship_1:0 "Charlemagne Class"
 FRA_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Charlemagne class of super battleships is a hypothetical design to match the big battleships of other navies. They feature a heavy armament all forward in superfiring positions, heavy AA armament, and thick armor. The entire design borrows elements from the Richelieu and British Nelson classes."
 FRA_SH_battleship_2:0 "Napoléon Bonaparte Class"
 FRA_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Napoléon Bonaparte-class battleships were a hypothetical design and based on the Alsace and Gascogne classes. Its heavy armament is distributed evenly fore and aft in triple turrets, with superfiring secondaries and heavy AA armament. Thick armor and strong engines provide the speed and defense needed to keep up with the other ships in the fleet and effectively battle its adversaries."
 FRA_carrier_1:0 "Béarn Class"
 FRA_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Béarn was originally laid down as a Normandie-class battleship but later finished as an aircraft carrier, displacing 22,100 tons and serving during the interbellum years and WWII. As a converted carrier, its speed was slow and it had limited space for aircraft, but the medium armor belt and long range made up for these shortcomings. Its construction gave important experience to the French designers in the DCAN (Direction des Constructions et Armes Navale) and led to a series of design studies afterward."
 FRA_carrier_2:0 "Joffre Class"
 FRA_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Joffre-class carriers (Project name PA-16) were the next generation of carriers for the French Navy. It was the last of the design studies that started in 1929 and ended in 1937. Two ships were authorized in the 1938 naval program, but the escalating conflicts slowed down the construction process and eventually the Fall of France prevented the completion of these ships. Displacement would be around 20,000 tons. They would have good AA armament, armor, and speed, but a below-average aircraft complement. Overall, it would have been a well-rounded and versatile carrier for the French Navy."
 FRA_carrier_3:0 "Jean Bart Class"
 FRA_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Jean Bart carrier was a mid-war proposal to convert the unfinished Richelieu class battleship Jean Bart into a full scale carrier in a similar way to the Japanese IJN Shinano. The hull's large size would be resulted in a large aircraft component and together with the big engines a long range and fast carrier. The heavy AA armament of US origin would provide a good defense against aircraft and smaller surface combatants."
 FRA_carrier_4:0 "Clemenceau Class"
 FRA_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Clemenceau class aircraft carrier (Project name PA-28) were the first postwar carrier design of the French Navy. The design would be similar to the unfinished Joffre class carriers, though the installed equipment and weaponry would be of modern French products. The acquisition of the USN and RN escort carriers and the economical state of postwar France prevented these ships from being laid down. Not to be confused with the latter Clemenceau class aircraft carriers (Project name PA-54), which were laid down in 1955 and 1957."

 JAP_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The heavy Mogami class was an up-gunned and reclassified light cruiser class. This made them fast, heavily armed and well-armored cruisers. Their long range came at the cost of, thinner armor protection."
 JAP_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Tone Class"
 JAP_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Tone class heavy cruisers were originally designed as light cruisers, but revisioned with heavier armaments. They were unique in that all armaments were positioned forward, while the aft part of the ship was used to carry and service float-planes that scouted for enemy forces."
 JAP_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Ibuki Class"
 JAP_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Ibuki-class heavy cruisers were the last cruisers to be built by Japan before the end of the war. They were improved versions of the Mogami class heavy cruisers, featuring the same layout and armament but with more modern AA weaponry and engines."
 JAP_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Amagi Class"
 JAP_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Amagi battlecruisers were a series of planned battlecruisers as part of the Japanese Navy's ambitious plan to have eight battleships and eight battlecruisers. Following the Washington Naval Treaty, the Amagi ships were scrapped, and one converted to a carrier."
 JAP_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Design B-65"
 JAP_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Design B-65 battlecruisers were fast, moderately armored vessels with good AA weaponry and modern armaments. Designed to fight the new heavy cruisers of the US Navy and to protect the fleet carriers of the IJN, the ships would have been a force to be reckoned with if finished."
 JAP_battleship_1:0 "Fuso Class"
 JAP_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Fuso class battleships were built during WWI and modernized in the 1930's when the 1st London Naval Treaty banned construction of new battleships for the signatories. They were well-armored and armed, with the 6 twin turrets on the centerline giving a heavy broadside, but also limiting the extra AA weaponry these ships could carry."

 JAP_battleship_2:0 "Kongo Class"
 JAP_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Kongo battleships were built for the IJN just before World War I as battlecruisers, but were heavily modernized in the late 1930s and reclassified as first rate fast battleships. Their armor, guns and engines were all drastically upgraded and the Kongos emerged as the fastest Japanese battleships of the war."
 JAP_battleship_3:0 "Tajima Class"
 JAP_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Tajima class was a hypothetical class of fast battleships, designed to be cheaper and faster to build than the massive Yamato class battleships. They utilized the older cannons of previous battleships, but high speed, adequate armor and AA provided the defense for these ships."
 JAP_battleship_4:0 "Iwami Class"
 JAP_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Iwami class was a hypothetical class of battleships, that utilized new methods to speed up construction. They were well-armed with new cannons and heavy AA guns, and could match any similarly armed vessels for firepower. However, the resulting improvements meant a heavier and thus somewhat slower class of ships."
 JAP_SH_battleship_1:0 "Yamato Class"
 JAP_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Yamato class consisted of the heaviest battleships ever created, displacing 72,000 tons, and the ships were designed to be the pride and might of the Japanese navy under the Peace Goddesses plan. Each ship carried nine 460-millimetre naval guns, the largest naval artillery ever fitted to a warship."
 JAP_SH_battleship_2:0 "Super Yamato Class"
 JAP_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The hypothetical Super Yamato class saw the Yamato was used as a base, but the weapons would be even stronger with a main armament of 51cm cannons and a strong AA armament of the newest type. Their armor thickness was designed to withstand even shells from its own cannons, and they would displace around 70-80.000tons."
 JAP_carrier_1:0 "Kaga Class"
 JAP_carrier_1_desc:0 "The aircraft carrier Kaga was Japan's first fleet carrier. She was originally a battleship, but finished as an aircraft carrier. This resulted in a large and heavily armored carrier with limited space for improvement. However, it was an important experience in aircraft carrier construction for the Imperial Japanese Navy."
 #JAP_carrier_1b: "Akagi Class" (refit Kaga class)
 JAP_carrier_2:0 "Soryu Class"
 JAP_carrier_2_desc:0 "Soryu and Hiryu were designed with mirrored island superstructure to speed up aircraft recovery processes while sailing next to each other. They were fast carriers with room for large air groups, but minimally armored. They displaced 20.000tons and large engines provided high speed and a long range of operations."
 #JAP_carrier_2b: "Hiryu Class"
 JAP_carrier_3:0 "Shokaku Class"
 JAP_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Shokaku class aircraft carriers were designed for high speed, long radius of action, heavy protection and a large aircraft capacity, which made them excellent carriers. Due to the improved construction methods, they displaced 33.000tons full load, and could survive more damage than most contemporary carriers."
 #JAP_carrier_3b: "Hiyo Class"
 JAP_carrier_4:0 "Taiho Class"
 JAP_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Taiho class aircraft carrier was the IJN's first fully armored carriers, with an armored flight deck to withstand multiple bomb and torpedo hits and still function effectively. A large air group together AND heavy AA armament would provide not just self-defense but also force projection over enemy forces."

 ### SOV - SOVIET UNION ###
 SOV_submarine_1:0 "AG Class"
 SOV_submarine_1_desc:0 "Amerikansky Golland (American Holland) class submarines were built in Canada, then delivered to Russia during WWI, where they were finally assembled. They were the direct copy of the successful Holland type submarines. They were designed to be good sea boats well-armed for their time."
 #SOV_submarine_1b: "Series I Debakrist"
 SOV_submarine_2:0 "Series V Shchuka"
 SOV_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Series V submarines of the Schuka class were the second-most numerous submarines of the Soviet Navy. Their large number came from their deployment to the four fleets of the Soviet Union: Black Sea, Baltic, Northern and Pacific. They were medium-sized patrol submarines with good torpedo armament and seaworthiness."
 #SOV_submarine_2b: "Series IX Srednyaya" (Stalinets<-unofficial name)
 #SOV_submarine_2c: "Series X Shchuka"
 SOV_submarine_3:0 "Series XIV K-Class"
 SOV_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Series XIV submarines were large cruising submarines with extended range. They were essentially an improved version of the Series IV Pravda class. These submarines featured heavy armament of both surface guns and torpedoes. They had a long range but only satisfactory seaworthiness."
 SOV_submarine_4:0 "Project 611"
 SOV_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Project 611 submarines (NATO Codename: Zulu), were the Soviet Navy's first submarine class to be built after WWII. Their design was based on the German Type XXI submarines, and they were meant to replace the older Series XIV K class boats. They were large, ocean-going submarines with a heavy torpedo armament and long range. They were used as a basis for the follow-up Project 613 (NATO Codename: Whiskey) and Project 641 (NATO Codename: Foxtrot) class submarines."
 SOV_destroyer_1:0 "Orfey Class"
 SOV_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Orfey class destroyers were an improved version of the previous Novik class. They featured adequate surface and AA armament for their size, somewhat short range, but good speed and heavy torpedo armament. The succeeding Fidonisy and Izyaslav classes were further improved versions of this class with increased main armament and hull size."
 #SOV_destroyer_1b: "Leningrad & Minsk Class"
 SOV_destroyer_2:0 "Gnevny Class"
 SOV_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Gnevny class (Project 7) destroyers were authorized under the 1933-1938 shipbuilding program. The class itself was heavily influenced by the Italian destroyer Maestrale and considered a successful design. Their displacement were in the range of 1,600-2,000 tons, they were well-armed and they had adequate AA and torpedo armament. Due to the powerful engines they were fast but short-ranged vessels."
 SOV_destroyer_3:0 "Soobrazitelnyi Class"
 SOV_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The Soobrazitelnyi (Project 7U) destroyers were an improved version of the previous Gnevny class. Their engines were redesigned and they had a stronger AA armament. They displaced between 1,900 and 2,400 tons, and their speed and range were similar to the Gnevny class."
 #SOV_destroyer_3b: "Ognevoy Class"
 SOV_destroyer_4:0 "Skoryi Class"
 SOV_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Skoryi class (Project 30bis) was a further improvement on the Ognevoy class. The increase in size and displacement (2,500-3,100 tons) resulted in a more stable ship with an increased operational range. All ships were built after the War to a modular design that resulted in rapid construction and deployment times. Their armament was the same as that of the previous Ognevoy class, but the main guns were housed in twin turrets instead of single turrets."
 SOV_light_cruiser_1:0 "Krasniy Krym Class"
 SOV_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Krasniy Krym class cruiser, originally the Svetlana class cruiser, had her construction started before WWI but the war and the following revolution delayed the completion of the entire class. In the mid-late 1920's, she was finally commissioned into the Soviet Navy along with her half-sister Chervona Ukraina (ex Admiral Nakhimov). These vessels were the first turbine-driven cruisers of the Imperial Russian Navy. They were heavily armed and well-armored cruisers for their time."
 SOV_light_cruiser_2:0 "Komsomolets Class"
 SOV_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Komsomolets class light cruisers were series of hypothetical vessels. They were somewhat of a mix of older and new technologies. Using the incomplete hulls of the Svetlana and Admiral Nakhimov classes, the ship's construction costs were reduced. Equipped with six twin turrets of smaller, destroyer caliber guns and adequate AA armament they were suited for scouting and a destroyer flotilla leader role. The overall look of the ships bears similarities to the Kirov class cruisers."
 SOV_light_cruiser_3:0 "Chapayev Class"
 SOV_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Chapayev class (Project 68) cruisers were based on the Kirov class (Project 26) cruisers and authorized in the 1938-43 shipbuilding program. As the first true light cruisers of the Soviet navy, they carried a strong anti-surface and anti-air armament together with an adequate torpedo armament. Overall, these were good ships with a thick armor belt, high speed, a good operational range, and a displacement of 10,500 to 14,000 tons. Due to the war and the invasion of the German forces, many ships of the class were cancelled and the rest were finished after the hostilities ended."
 SOV_light_cruiser_4:0 "Sverdlov Class"
 SOV_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Sverdlov class cruisers (Project 68bis) were the last gun cruisers of the Soviet Navy and were improved versions of the preceding Chapayev class. Compared to the Chapayevs, they had the same main armament, machinery and armor protection, but had increased fuel capacity for greater range, improved underwater protection, an increased anti-aircraft battery, and slightly better seaworthiness. They were designed for the roles of convoy hunting and capital ship escorts. Due to the advent of the missile age, many ships were cancelled or not finished."
 SOV_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Krasniy Kavkaz Class"
 SOV_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Krasnyi Kavkaz cruiser, originally the Admiral Nakhimov class light cruiser, was the half-sister of the Chervona Ukraina. Krasnyi Kavkaz was completed with a modified design that included larger-caliber 180mm guns and stronger AA armament. Because she was a rebuilt light cruiser, her armor was thinner compared to the heavy cruisers of other navies."
 SOV_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Kirov Class"
 SOV_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Kirov class (Project 26) cruisers were the Soviet Navy's first modern cruisers. The design was based on the Italian Raimondo Montecuccoli class light cruisers and was built as part of the 1933-1938 shipbuilding program. The ships displaced between 7,700 and 9,200 tons. They were armed with new 180mm guns in 3 triple turrets and a solid AA battery. Their strong engines provided good speed and an acceptable operational range, while the armor belt was thin compared to other heavy cruisers."
 #SOV_heavy_cruiser_2b: "Maxim Gorky Class"
 SOV_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Project 22"
 SOV_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Project 22 heavy cruisers were designed in the mid 1930's to counter similar vessels in neighboring countries. The design called for a larger-sized vessel displacing between 15,500 and 17,000 tons. They were equipped with four triple 240mm cannons to fight off enemy cruisers, a heavy AA armament for self-defense, and a larger scout plane force to find the enemy. Their main tasks would be to scout for enemy forces and convoy hunting. The cost of the ships and the allocation of resources to other needs resulted in the cancellation of the project."
 SOV_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Project 66"
 SOV_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Project 66 heavy cruisers were the Soviet Navy's last attempt to design and build a purely gun cruiser. Design studies started in 1943 and the final version emerged after the war. The vessels would feature 220mm cannons in 3 triple turrets and a strong AA armament. Displacement would be at least 26,500 tons. The advent of the missile age and the death of Josef Stalin caused the project to be terminated."
 SOV_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Borodino Class"
 SOV_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Borodino-class battlecruisers were class of four vessels authorized in 1914, just before WWI. They were based on the Imperatritsa Mariya class battleships. They followed the contemporary Russian capital ship building practices of using four triple turrets to house the heavy main armament, strong secondary armament in casemates, and an overall flush-deck. They had a low profile with low draught to fight in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea. Like many Russian ships of this period, the outbreak of WWI and the Russian Revolution doomed these ships from ever being finished."
 SOV_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Kronshtadt Class"
 SOV_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Kronshtadt class (Project 69) battlecruisers were authorized in the 1938-43 shipbuilding program and scheduled to be finished in the 1940's. The original design aimed for a large-sized heavy cruiser of 23,000 tons, but after information on German Scharnhorst battlecruisers arrived, the ships were redesigned to displace to 35,000 tons. As hostilities broke out between Germany and the Soviet Union, the ships construction was halted and eventually cancelled. Alternative plans called for finishing the incomplete hulls as aircraft carriers under Project 69AV."
 SOV_battleship_1:0 "Marat Class"
 SOV_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Marat class battleships (originally Gangut class) were WWI-era battleships and the first Dreadnoughts to serve in the Imperial Russian Navy. Their design and turret layout served as the basis of all the succeeding battleship and battlecruiser classes. Only three ships survived the chaos of the Russian Revolution. They were modernized and refitted during the 1930's, resulting in a tall almost pagoda-like superstructure. They had modern electronics and a strong AA complement."
 SOV_battleship_2:0 "Project 21"
 SOV_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Project 21 battleships were designed in the mid 1930's to be part of Stalin's Ocean-Going Navy. They would be very similar to the British Nelson-class battleships. The ships would displace around 41,000 tons, would be armed with nine 406mm cannons in 3 triple turrets (all forward), and a secondary armament of twelve 152mm guns. Its good AA armament and thick armor provided a strong defense against air and surface targets. The project was eventually cancelled but part of its elements were used in the Sovetsky Soyuz-class (Project 23) battleships."
 SOV_battleship_3:0 "Lenin class"
 SOV_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lenin-class battleship was a hypothetical design to match and counter the German Bismarck and U.S. South Dakota class battleships. Its nine 406mm cannons in 3 triple turrets would provide adequate firepower, while its 130mm AA guns, thick armor, and large engines would ensure its survival in battle."
 SOV_battleship_4:0 "Stalingrad Class"
 SOV_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Stalingrad class (Project 82) capital ships were intended to provide the Soviet navy with its primary firepower in the post WWII era. They were fast, well-armed, and well-armored vessels. Construction started after the war, but the death of Josif Stalin led to the cancellation of these ships, though there were projects to finish at least one as a modified design equipped with Soviet V-2 missiles."
 SOV_SH_battleship_1:0 "Sovetsky Soyuz Class"
 SOV_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Sovetsky Soyuz-class (Project 23) was the last class of battleships built by the Soviet shipyards and were authorized in the 1938-43 shipbuilding program. Four ships were planned with a standard displacement of 59,000 tons, three triple turrets carrying 406mm cannons, and a heavy secondary and AA armament. They also had strong engines to accommodate their very thick belt armor. The outbreak of the war prevented these ships from being completed."
 SOV_SH_battleship_2:0 "Project 23bis"
 SOV_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Project 23bis-class battleships were a modified and improved version of the previous Sovetsky Soyuz-class (Project 23). Compared to their predecessors, they carried four triple turrets of the same 406mm caliber cannons, thickened belt armor, a revised layout of secondary guns, and stronger AA armament."
 SOV_carrier_1:0 "Ismail Class"
 SOV_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Ismail class aircraft carrier was the direct conversion of the unfinished hull of her Borodino-class battlecruiser namesake. Due to the nature of conversion, the ship would have a thick armor belt and strong anti-surface and AA armament for her time. A moderately-sized air group would provide her fleet the necessary air cover. The project was not carried out due to costs and the state of the Soviet shipbuilding industry after the October Revolution."
 SOV_carrier_2:0 "Krasnyi Vozdukh"
 SOV_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Krasnyi Vozdukh-class aircraft carrier was a hypothetical design to provide the Soviet navy air projection over its fleets. They were similar in size to the British Ark Royal or Japanese Hiryu classes but carried additional secondary guns against surface targets and adequate AA guns for air cover. The increased armor results in a slightly reduced air group compared to these classes."
 SOV_carrier_3:0 "Project 71B"
 SOV_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Project 71B carriers were designed in the mid-to-late 1930's. They were planned to provide air cover for the new surface fleets Stalin ordered in his plan. Two ships were planned that would displace around 30,000 tons, have strong AA armament, good armor, and an adequate air group. The German invasion caused the cancellation of construction for these vessels."
 SOV_carrier_4:0 "Project 72"
 SOV_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Project 72 aircraft carriers were the improved versions of the previous Project 71 ships. Design studies finished in the early 1940's resulting in a larger ship with thinner armor. The extra space was used to install stronger AA armament and provide for the ability to carry a larger air group."

 USA_submarine_1:0 "S Class"
 USA_submarine_1_desc:0 "The S boats, commonly known as Sugar Boats, were a series of 51 submarines design and built in the 1920s. Over the WW1 era O & R Boat series, the S Boats were larger allowing longer range and more torpedo reloads even though the class only had four forward-facing 21 inch tubes. Despite their age, with the last S Boat to be commissioned in 1924, the S Boats comprise a significant portion of the US Navy's standing Submarine force."
 #USA_submarine_1b: "Barracuda Class"
 USA_submarine_2:0 "Porpoise Class"
 USA_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Porpoise Class submarine was the US Navy's first modern submarine designed and built following a series of experimental "V Boats" built in the late 20s and early 30s. Despite initial issues with the all-electric propulsion, the class held promise and was being considered as future designs. The class was armed with 6 torpedo tubes and a 3" deck gun."

 USA_destroyer_1:0 "Clemson Class"
 USA_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Clemson Class destroyer continued with many design elements of its immediate predecessor, the Wickes Class. The Clemson had improved sea handling over the Wickes Class and was armed with 4"/50 caliber main guns, a 3"/23 caliber AA gun and 12 torpedo tubes. The class was aging and was nearly obsolete, but still comprised the bulk of the US Navy's Destroyer force."
 #USA_destroyer_1b: "Farragut Class"
 USA_destroyer_2:0 "Sims Class"
 USA_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Sims Class was the largest "1500 Tonner" design with a more streamlined torpedo arrangement and longer hull. Improvement in fire control granted better attack capabilities with its 5"/38 caliber guns and included 12 centerline torpedo tubes."
 #USA_destroyer_2b: "Benson & Gleaves Class"
 USA_destroyer_3:0 "Fletcher Class"
 USA_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The Fletcher Class represented a large step forward in terms of destroyer capability, thanks largely to its increase to 2500 tons. While keeping the 5"/38 dual purpose guns and centerline torpedo arrangement, the class added an additional single turret and received significant increases in AA weaponry as well as improved range and larger displacement."
 USA_destroyer_4:0 "Allen M Sumner Class"
 USA_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Sumner Class continued on the Fletcher Class with displacement only marginally increased. The ship was able to take on more armament gaining dual 5"/38 caliber guns and a much larger compliment of AA weaponry. The addition of a second rudder allowed for improve maneuvering during ASW operations."
 USA_light_cruiser_1:0 "Omaha Class"
 USA_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Omaha Class was initially designed to fill a key scouting role in the US Navy's WW1 fleet. A fast and capable class, the Omaha Class was armed with a formidable load out of 6"/53 caliber guns in an 8x1 and 2x2 turret configuration and six torpedo launchers. The Omaha Class was aging but comprised of the bulk of the US Navy's Light Cruiser force."
 USA_light_cruiser_2:0 "Brooklyn Class"
 USA_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Brooklyn Class was designed with the Washington Naval Treaty in mind and so was restricted to 6" guns. To maximize firepower, the Brooklyn's was armed with 15 of the new Mk16 6" guns in triple turrets. The overall design was very balanced and was considered as the basis of all future cruiser designs for the US Navy."
 USA_light_cruiser_3:0 "Cleveland Class"
 USA_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Cleveland Class was based on the Brooklyn Class, but without the Washington Naval Treaty restrictions. The Cleveland Class keeps the 15 6" main gun arrangement, but increased its secondary 5" armament greatly and added additional AA weaponry."
 USA_light_cruiser_4:0 "Fargo Class"
 USA_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Fargo Class improved on the successful Cleveland Class. It offered improved fields of AA fire thanks to a better designed pyramid-shaped superstructure."
 USA_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Pensacola Class"
 USA_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Pensacola Class were designed under the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty, and sought to maximize firepower under the 8" gun restriction. It was armed with a formidable armament of 10 x 8"/55 guns. The hull armor was thin and the design was top heavy but capable. It formed the bulk of the US Navy's Heavy Cruiser force."

 USA_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Oregon City Class"
 USA_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Oregon City Class cruisers provided broad and marginal improvements over the Baltimore Class. Most notably was the change in the super structure which allowed better fields of AA fire. Similar improvements were also found from the Cleveland to the Oregon City class light cruisers."
 USA_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Lexington Class"
 USA_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Lexington Class was initially a reaction to Japan's Kongo class battlecruiser. Ordered by the Naval Act of 1916, the ships were intended to carry 16" guns in dual turrets and be capable of 33 knots. After construction began, the US entered into the Washington Naval Treaty and the USS Lexington and USS Saratoga was converted to Carriers."
 USA_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Alaska Class"
 USA_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Alaska Class was a response to the German pocket battleships now more so to Japan's "super cruisers." Designed to carry 12" guns and handle up to 10" shell fire, the class was capable of cruiser speeds but sacrificed under water protection."
 USA_battleship_1:0 "New York Class"
 USA_battleship_1_desc:0 "The New York Class battleships were the first US Battleships to be armed with the 14"/45 caliber main guns. Numerous 5"/51 guns provided secondary armament and over 10" of armor."

 USA_battleship_3:0 "Iowa Class"
 USA_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Iowa Class added all the innovations and capabilities of the earlier North Carolina, but substantially increases its displacement and tactical speed. The Iowa's was primarily responsible for escorting carriers groups and was designed with a second role of "cruiser killer" in mind."
 USA_battleship_4:0 "Illinois Class"
 USA_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Illinois Class continued with the design and role defined by the Iowa Class. It maintained speed and armament over armor. The Illinois Class increased the number of 16"/50 caliber guns from 9 to 12 while it also improved boilers and machinery in order to provide more efficient high cruise speeds. Like the Montana Class, initial designs included four 4 6" guns dual turrets, but this was reverted to the dual purpose 5" twin turret emplacements to maximize AA capabilities."
 USA_carrier_1:0 "Lexington Class"
 USA_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Lexington Class carrier was born from the converted hulls of two Lexington Class battlecruisers in order to conform to the limitations imposed by the Washington Naval Treaty. The class was the first operational carrier class in the US Navy and spent several years improving carrier operations."
 USA_carrier_2:0 "Ranger Class"
 USA_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ranger Class was the first US Navy class designed as a carrier from the keel up. As part of a US Navy smaller carrier concept the class was much smaller than the previous Lexington Class, yet still retained the same air group compliment thanks to improvements on interior designs."

 USA_carrier_3:0 "Essex Class"
 USA_carrier_3_desc:0 "With the lessons learned from the preceding Lexington, Ranger and Yorktown variant classes, the result was the Essex Class, a fast ship able to carry a large compliment of planes into battle. Damage control designs would also be carried over from the Yorktown class and a deck edge elevator was included to improve plane handling."
 USA_carrier_4:0 "Midway Class"
 USA_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Midway Class was the ultimate in US Navy carrier capability. Implementing an armored deck and able to carry far more aircraft than previous classes, the Midway Class was being given a unique sub-class designation, CVB (Carrier Vessel Battle)."
 USA_SH_battleship_1:0 "Virginia Class"
 USA_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "In 1920 the construction of the large South Dakota Class battleships fielding 12 x 16"/50 guns started. The class would have ushered in a new era in heavy battleship design but was cancelled in 1922 to conform to the Washington Naval Treaty. With the Treaty no longer in effect and the threat of a secret Japanese battleship project we can modernize the design, increase displacement to over 55,000 tons and up gun the design with 18"/50 caliber guns to create a new class of heavy battleship."
 USA_SH_battleship_2:0 "Montana Class"
 USA_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Montana Class was bigger and more armored than the Illinois Class, sacrificing speed to accommodate the increase. Its main armament of 12 x 18"/50 caliber guns and with our latest fire control system the Montana's firepower will be unmatched. Initial designs included 6" guns, but this was changed to return to the dual purpose 5" twin turret emplacements."

They were built in the late stages of World War I and were equipped with new, larger 21 in. torpedoes. They served until the beginning of World War II when they were mostly used for secondary and training duties."
 AST_submarine_2:0 "T Class"
 AST_submarine_2_desc:0 "The T-class or Triton-class boats were designed to replace the O, P, and R class large submarines. They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. These boats were well-armed, stable platforms and were used extensively during the conflict, as 25 percent of the constructed boats were lost during the war."
 AST_submarine_3:0 "U Class"
 AST_submarine_3_desc:0 "The U class were small-sized submarines built under the War Emergency 1940 and 1941 Programs. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the class Undine, Umpire and Uproar."
 AST_submarine_4:0 "V Class"
 AST_submarine_4_desc:0 "The V-class or Vampire-class submarines were based on the previous U-class smaller sized boats. They were larger but still relatively small, with better seagoing ability but limited operational range and weaponry."
 AST_destroyer_1:0 "Vendetta Class"
 AST_destroyer_1_desc:0 "These destroyers included the Admirality and Thornycroft V and W classes, which were transferred to the RAN to form the 'Scrap Iron Flotilla'. They were built under the War Emergency Program. They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First World War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WWI and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, used eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
 AST_destroyer_2:0 "G/H/I Class"
 AST_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The G, H, and I class destroyers were ordered as part of the 1933 and 1934 Naval Construction Programs. They were generally repeats of the preceding F class, with a slight reduction in size. Armament in the G and H classes was the same as in the F class, with both using on the 4.7 in. guns. These ships had long range, were adequately armed, and had a strong torpedo complement. They were used extensively during the war and suffered numerous losses."

 AST_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Southampton-class light cruisers were a subclass of the Town-class cruisers and were designed to counter the Japanese Mogami-class cruisers. These vessels were well-armored, had good speed and range, and carried a formidable armament of twelve 6 in. guns in four triple turrets. They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."
 AST_light_cruiser_3:0 "Crown Colony Class"
 AST_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Crown Colony-class light cruisers were improved versions of the earlier Town class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armored but because of their smaller engines, their range was somewhat reduced. The type included two subclasses: Fiji and Ceylon."
 AST_light_cruiser_4:0 "Minotaur Class"
 AST_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Also known as the Swiftsure class, these cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Crown Colony class, incorporating war modifications that were authorized in 1941.

 AST_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Class"
 AST_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 AST_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Churchill Design"
 AST_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "These ships were proposed by Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admirality, in the early stages of WWII to counter the German Deutschland class big gun cruisers. These vessels would have had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armor. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships. The ships were eventually cancelled because of high costs and a lack of demand for a new heavy cruiser. "
 AST_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Renown Class"
 AST_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WWI. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armor and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."
 AST_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Princess Royal Class"
 AST_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal was a class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy with quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 AST_battleship_1:1 "Revenge Class"
 AST_battleship_1_desc:1 "The Revenge-class battleships were ordered in 1913 as cheap versions of the Queen Elizabeth-class fast dreadnoughts. While similarly armed and armored, their considerably lower speed relegated them to secondary duties during WWII. Of the envisioned 8 ships of the class, only 5 were finished."
 AST_battleship_2:0 "King George V Class"
 AST_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 AST_battleship_3:0 "Lion Class"
 AST_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 AST_battleship_4:0 "Vanguard Class"
 AST_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Vanguard-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theater. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Program, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament was the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armor made the vessel fast and well protected."
 AST_SH_battleship_1:0 "Centurion Class"
 AST_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion was a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 AST_SH_battleship_2:0 "Lion II Class"
 AST_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 AST_carrier_1:0 "Courageous Class"
 AST_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement was limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 AST_carrier_2:0 "Ark Royal Class"
 AST_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She was the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel was well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 AST_carrier_3:0 "Illustrious Class"
 AST_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Illustrious class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armored flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."
 AST_carrier_4:0 "Implacable Class"
 AST_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Implacable-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Program and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armor on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious class."

 CAN_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Illustrious class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armored flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."
 CAN_carrier_4:0 "Implacable Class"
 CAN_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Implacable-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Program and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armor on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious class."

They were built in the late stages of World War I and were equipped with new, larger 21 in. torpedoes. They served until the beginning of World War II when they were mostly used for secondary and training duties."
 NZL_submarine_2:0 "T Class"
 NZL_submarine_2_desc:0 "The To-class or Triton-class boats were designed to replace the O, P, and R class large submarines. They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. These boats were well-armed, stable platforms and were used extensively during the conflict, as 25 percent of the constructed boats were lost during the war."
 NZL_submarine_3:0 "U Class"
 NZL_submarine_3_desc:0 "The U class were small-sized submarines built under the War Emergency 1940 and 1941 Programs. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the class: Undine, Umpire and Uproar."
 NZL_submarine_4:0 "V Class"
 NZL_submarine_4_desc:0 "The V-class or Vampire-class submarines were based on the previous U-class smaller sized boats. They were larger but still relatively small, with better seagoing ability but limited operational range and weaponry."
 NZL_destroyer_1:0 "V/W Class"
 NZL_destroyer_1_desc:0 "These destroyers included the Admirality and Thornycroft V and W classes. They were built under the War Emergency Program. They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First World War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WWI and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, used eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
 NZL_destroyer_2:0 "G/H/I Class"
 NZL_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The G, H, and I class destroyers were ordered as part of the 1933 and 1934 Naval Construction Programs. They were generally repeats of the preceding F class, with a slight reduction in size. Armament in the G and H classes was the same as in the F class, with both using on the 4.7 in. guns. These ships had long range, were adequately armed, and had a strong torpedo complement. They were used extensively during the war and suffered numerous losses."
 NZL_destroyer_3:0 "J/K/N Class"
 NZL_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The J, K, and N classes were similar to the earlier Tribal class but rather than emphasizing gun armament, the designers returned to a more standard heavy torpedo and lighter gun setup. The ships were modified throughout their wartime service. Upgrades included improved anti-aircraft guns and radar. They were fast, long-ranged and well-armed vessels ideal for fleet escorts."
 NZL_destroyer_4:0 "Battle Class"
 NZL_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Battle class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programs. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels. Their late introduction to the war led to a minimal contribution."
 NZL_light_cruiser_1:0 "C Class"
 NZL_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "C-class light cruisers were a group of twenty-eight light cruisers of the Royal Navy. They were built before and during the First World War for the rough conditions of the North Sea. They proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load. They saw extensive use during WWI and participated in many surface actions. Only the Caledon, Ceres, and Carlisle subclasses were in service by the mid 1930's."

 NZL_light_cruiser_2:0 "Southampton Class"
 NZL_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Southampton-class light cruisers were a subclass of the Town-class cruisers and were designed to counter the Japanese Mogami-class cruisers. These vessels were well-armored, had good speed and range, and carried a formidable armament of twelve 6 in. guns in four triple turrets. They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."
 NZL_light_cruiser_3:0 "Gambia Class"
 NZL_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Gambia class was the New Zeland designation for British Crown Colony-class light cruisers. These were improved versions of the earlier Town class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armored but because of their smaller engines, their range was somewhat reduced. The type included two subclasses: Fiji and Ceylon."
 NZL_light_cruiser_4:0 "Black Prince Class"
 NZL_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Black Prince class was the Canadian designation for British Minotaur-class (or Swiftsure-class) light cruisers. These cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Crown Colony class, incorporating war modifications that were authorized in 1941. They had a longer operational range and more numerous AA weaponry than the Crown Colony class, while the main armament was reduced to three triple turrets. Built too late to affect the outcome of the war, most of the ordered vessels were cancelled afterwards. "
 NZL_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Hawkins Class"
 NZL_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Hawkins-class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armor belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection. Altogether, five ships were commissioned but only four were active at the start of WWII."
 NZL_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Surrey Class"
 NZL_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Program. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they would have been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armor, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 NZL_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Class"
 NZL_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 NZL_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Churchill Design"
 NZL_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "These ships were proposed by Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admirality, in the early stages of WWII to counter the German Deutschland class big gun cruisers. These vessels would have had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armor. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships. The ships were eventually cancelled because of high costs and a lack of demand for a new heavy cruiser. "
 NZL_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Renown Class"
 NZL_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WWI. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armor and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."
 NZL_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Princess Royal Class"
 NZL_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal was a class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 NZL_battleship_1:1 "Revenge Class"
 NZL_battleship_1_desc:1 "The Revenge-class battleships were ordered in 1913 as cheap versions of the Queen Elizabeth-class fast dreadnoughts. While similarly armed and armored, their considerably lower speed relegated them to secondary duties during WWII. Of the envisioned 8 ships of the class, only 5 were finished."
 NZL_battleship_2:0 "King George V Class"
 NZL_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 NZL_battleship_3:0 "Lion Class"

Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 NZL_battleship_4:0 "Vanguard Class"
 NZL_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Vanguard-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theater. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Program, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament was the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armor made the vessel fast and well protected."
 NZL_SH_battleship_1:0 "Centurion Class"
 NZL_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion was a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 NZL_SH_battleship_2:0 "Lion II Class"
 NZL_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 NZL_carrier_1:0 "Courageous Class"
 NZL_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement was limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 NZL_carrier_2:0 "Ark Royal Class"
 NZL_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She was the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel was well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 NZL_carrier_3:0 "Illustrious Class"
 NZL_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Illustrious class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armored flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range. "
 NZL_carrier_4:0 "Implacable Class"
 NZL_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Implacable-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Program and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armor on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious class."

The armament was the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armor made the vessel fast and well protected."
 SAF_SH_battleship_1:0 "Centurion Class"
 SAF_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion was a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 SAF_SH_battleship_2:0 "Lion II Class"
 SAF_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 SAF_carrier_1:0 "Courageous Class"
 SAF_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement was limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 SAF_carrier_2:0 "Ark Royal Class"
 SAF_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She was the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel was well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 SAF_carrier_3:0 "Illustrious Class"
 SAF_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Illustrious class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armored flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range. "
 SAF_carrier_4:0 "Implacable Class"
 SAF_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Implacable-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Program and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armor on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious class."

 SIA_light_cruiser_3:0 "Taskin Class"
 SIA_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Taskin class consisted of a pair of light cruisers built in Italy. They were launched in 1941 but were requisitioned by the Siamese navy in 1942. They were to become the Etna-class Italian AA cruisers of the Regia Marina but were never completed before the Italian armistice. They would have displaced 5,900 tons and been armed with six 152mm/53 OTO 1929 guns in their main armament. They would have had decent armor but would be fairly slow for a cruiser."
 SIA_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Sri Ayuthia Class"
 SIA_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Sri Ayuthia class coastal defense ships were perhaps the last ships of this type built in the world, with both ships of the class built in Japan and commissioned for the Royal Thai Navy in 1938. The design was comparable to a small cruiser (or large destroyer) in size, to a battleship in speed, and to a heavy cruiser in armament. Its main guns were four 203mm/53 3-Shiki cannon. They were lightly armored compared to contemporary heavy cruisers."

The Germans intended to finish her as a light carrier but this project was also not carried out."
 VIC_light_cruiser_4:0 "Colbert Class"
 VIC_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Colbert was an anti-aircraft light cruiser launched in 1956. This Colbert-class cruiser was built in a very similar way to the post-war De Grasse, featuring heavy AA armament both for long and short ranges. The difference between Colbert and DeGrasse was that the Colbert had smaller engines, thinner armor, and was slightly smaller."
 VIC_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Suffren Class"
 VIC_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Suffren-class heavy cruisers were basically a repeat of the previous Duquesne class with minor improvements regarding its seagoing abilities. Both classes resembled the contemporary cruiser philosophy of the French navy: very thin armor but good speed and range. Their standard displacement is 10,000 tons and they were equipped with armaments that were standard for a heavy cruiser."
 VIC_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Algérie Class"
 VIC_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Algérie-class heavy cruiser were a further improvement of the previous classes of the Suffren and Duquesne but designed to be the opponent of the new Italian heavy cruisers of the Zara class. Both the main armor belt and underwater protection was considerably increased. Its AA armament was adequate for its time, but due to these changes, the standard displacement was over 10,000 tons."
 VIC_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Saint Louis Class"
 VIC_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Saint Louis-class heavy cruisers were based on the Algérie class but the overall look was closer to that of the Dunkerque and Richelieu class capital ships. Three ships were ordered in the 1940 naval program, but due to the Fall of France none of them were laid down. They would field new guns and improved AA armament but the armor would be the same as on the Algérie class. It was the last heavy cruiser design of the French Navy."
 VIC_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Forbin Class"
 VIC_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Forbin-class heavy cruisers were a hypothetical design as a follow up of the Saint Louis class. Designed to defend the trade lanes between Mainland France and the colonies, it had long range and good speed along with a heavy armament of guns in four triple turrets and an adequate number of AA weaponry. The ship layout and general look resembled an influence from the previous Saint Louis class as well as British Crown Colony class."
 VIC_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Durand-Viel Design"
 VIC_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Durand-Viel design of battlecruiser was a proposal among a series of studies dating back to WWI. They were essentially the battlecruiser versions of the Normandie and Lyon classes of battleship featuring the same quad turrets and guns though in reduced number. Like contemporary battlecruisers of other navies, they would be faster but less armored than a battleship. They were cancelled before WWI broke out."
 VIC_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Dunkerque Class"
 VIC_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Dunkerques were designed to counter the German Deutschland-class pocket battleships. They were the apex of a series design studies from the mid 1920's to early 1930's. Authorized in the 1931 and 1934 naval programs, they were similar to the British Nelson-class battleships, with all of their main turrets concentrated forward. This resulted in a shorter belt armor and thus a smaller ship to fit into the Naval Treaties limitations."
 VIC_battleship_1:0 "Courbet Class"
 VIC_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Courbet-class battleships were the first super-dreadnoughts built for the French Navy before and during the First World War. Authorized in the 1910 and 1911 naval programs, they saw limited service during World War I, but were active during WW2. Though they had thicker armor and stronger guns than the previous Dante class battleships, they were still inferior to contemporary USN and RN battleships. They displaced just over 22,000 tons and their only modernizations before WW2 were an improved AA armament and improved boilers."
 #VIC_battleship_1b: "Bretagne Class" 
 VIC_battleship_2:0 "Richelieu Class"
 VIC_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Richelieu-class battleships were the last battleships commissioned into the French Navy. They were an improved design of the Dunkerque and authorized under the 1935 and 1938 naval programs. They had excellent AA armament, speed and range, which made it an excellent capital ship. Out of the four ordered, only two were launched and one was completed before the Fall of France. There were numerous attempts to finish the remaining ships using different designs, proposed for use as anti-aircraft battleships, battleship-carrier hybrids, or full scale carriers."
 VIC_battleship_3:0 "Gascogne Class"
 VIC_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Gascogne class of battleships were a subclass of the Richelieu class. Three ships were ordered in the 1940 naval program but none were started. The design would be a repeat of the Richelieu, but with the main armament distributed evenly fore and aft, improved AA Armament, and improved engines resulting in an overall better ship."
 VIC_battleship_4:0 "Alsace Class"
 VIC_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Alsace-class battleships were planned to succeed the Richelieu class. Four ships were ordered, with the design studies finished in 1939, authorized in 1940, and expected to be laid down in 1941, though the Fall of France prevented this from happening. It improved upon the Richelieu design with heavier and more numerous main guns, stronger AA armament, thicker armor plates, and larger engines."
 VIC_SH_battleship_1:0 "Charlemagne Class"
 VIC_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Charlemagne class of super battleships was a hypothetical design to match the big battleships of other navies. They featured a heavy armament all forward in superfiring positions, heavy AA armament, and thick armor. The entire design borrowed elements from the Richelieu and British Nelson classes."
 VIC_SH_battleship_2:0 "Napoléon Bonaparte Class"
 VIC_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Napoléon Bonaparte-class battleships were a hypothetical design and based on the Alsace and Gascogne classes. Its heavy armament was distributed evenly fore and aft in triple turrets, with superfiring secondaries and heavy AA armament. Thick armor and strong engines provided the speed and defense needed to keep up with the other ships in the fleet and effectively battle its adversaries."
 VIC_carrier_1:0 "Béarn Class"
 VIC_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Béarn was originally laid down as a Normandie-class battleship but later finished as an aircraft carrier, displacing 22,100 tons and serving during the interbellum years and WWII. As a converted carrier, its speed was slow and it had limited space for aircraft, but the medium armor belt and long range made up for these shortcomings. Its construction gave important experience to the French designers in the DCAN (Direction des Constructions et Armes Navale) and led to a series of design studies afterward."
 VIC_carrier_2:0 "Joffre Class"
 VIC_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Joffre-class carriers (Project name PA-16) were the next generation of carriers for the French Navy. It was the last of the design studies that started in 1929 and ended in 1937. Two ships were authorized in the 1938 naval program, but the escalating conflicts slowed down the construction process and eventually the Fall of France prevented the completion of these ships. Displacement would be around 20,000 tons. They would have good AA armament, armor, and speed, but a below-average aircraft complement. Overall, it would have been a well-rounded and versatile carrier for the French Navy."
 VIC_carrier_3:0 "Jean Bart Class"
 VIC_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Jean Bart carrier was a mid-war proposal to convert the unfinished Richelieu class battleship Jean Bart into a full scale carrier in a similar way to the Japanese IJN Shinano. The hull's large size would be resulted in a large aircraft component and together with the big engines a long range and fast carrier. The heavy AA armament of US origin would have provided a good defense against aircraft and smaller surface combatants."
 VIC_carrier_4:0 "Clemenceau Class"
 VIC_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Clemenceau class aircraft carrier (Project name PA-28) were the first postwar carrier design of the French Navy. The design would be similar to the unfinished Joffre class carriers, though the installed equipment and weaponry would be of modern French products. The acquisition of the USN and RN escort carriers and the economical state of postwar France prevented these ships from being laid down. Not to be confused with the latter Clemenceau class aircraft carriers (Project name PA-54), which were laid down in 1955 and 1957."
 ### YUG - YUGOSLAVIA ###
 YUG_submarine_1:0 "Hrabri Class"
 YUG_submarine_1_desc:0 "The two Hrabri class submarines were originally laid down as British L-class submarines for the Royal Navy, but were sold and ultimately completed for Yugoslavia using a modified design in 1928. They were large submarines, displacing 975 tons, and were armed with six 533mm torpedo tubes."
 YUG_submarine_2:0 "Osvetnik Class"
 YUG_submarine_2_desc:0 "The two Osvetnik-class submarines were designed and built in France on the design of the Circe-class submarines. They were somewhat smaller than the preceeding Hrabri-class submarines. Equipped with six 533mm torpedo tubes, they still packed a comparable punch."
 YUG_destroyer_1:0 "Dubrovnik Class"
 YUG_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Dubrovnik destroyer was the largest ship in the Yugoslav fleet at the time of its purchase. The ship was built in the U.K. and delivered to Yugoslavia in 1932. It was a large destroyer, displacing 1,880 tons. It was armed with four 140mm/53 Skoda guns, a strong AA complement, six 533mm torpedo tubes, and good ASW equipment."
 YUG_destroyer_2:0 "Beograd Class"
 YUG_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Beograd class consisted of three destroyers built with French help. Two of the ships were built at Split, while the third was built in France. All three were based on the French L'Adroit-class destroyers and commissioned in 1939. They displaced 1,210 tons and were armed with four 120mm/43 Skoda guns and six 533mm torpedo tubes. They had excellent speed but below-average range."
 YUG_destroyer_4:0 "Split Class"
 YUG_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Split was a heavy destroyer launched and completed in Yugoslavia. It was launched in 1943 but not completed until 1958, with a modified design. Its original design displaced 2,400 tons and was armed with five 140/56 Skoda guns in its main armament. Despite its size, it had excellent speed."
 YUG_light_cruiser_1:0 "Dalmacija Class"
 YUG_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The old German cruiser SMS Niobe was sold in 1925 to the young Royal Yugoslavian Navy and extensively rebuilt. Equipped with modern AA and the heaviest guns in the Navy, Dalmacija served primarily as a gunnery training ship."
 ### FAT - Griffonian Republic ###
 FAT_destroyer_1:0 "Baron Class"
 FAT_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Baron-class was an early destroyer that, while moderately effective in the end, suffered due to a protracted development and construction cycle. Simply put, while advanced when first designed the Baron-class ended up being obsolete before a single one ever set sail. While a failure in combat large fuel reserves and space for sizable numbers of passengers would see the design being used as a VIP transport for many years, with both Princess Celestia and Emperor Grover V owning a Baron-clas."
 FAT_destroyer_2:0 "Naga Class"
 FAT_destroyer_2_desc:0 "Designed as a replacement for the Essex-class, the Naga-class won its design competition through sheer cheapness, an important trait in the then failing Griffonian Empire. Despite its cost effectiveness the Naga-class did not skip on any of its abilities, even if it was prohibited from excelling. The result is an easily forgettable design that is nonetheless ubiquitous with fleet escorts."
 FAT_destroyer_3:0 "Riga II Class"
 FAT_destroyer_3_desc:0 "An attempt to repeat the success of the Riga I-class, the Riga II-class ended up being a certain amount of tons lighter, dropping it into the destroyer role. This turned out to be fortuitous, as a role had opened up to escort the Republic’s new battleships. The second Riga would go down in history much like the first, as a success."
 FAT_destroyer_4:0 "Tatsumaki Class"
 FAT_destroyer_4_desc:0 "Named for the alleged whirlwind of firepower that it can unleash, the Tatsumaki-class’ name instead become synonymous with the vast number of technical problems that plagued the design. Most of these problems can be attributed to the extremely hasty way in which they were both designed and constructed, and most of the same were fixed simply by doubling the number of mechanics and engineers assigned to each ship. Similar ventures would thus be referred to as ‘pulling a tatsumaki’ in the future."
 FAT_destroyer_5:0 "Whirlwind Class"
 FAT_destroyer_5_short:0 "Whirlwing Class"
 FAT_destroyer_5_desc:0 "In an attempt to redo the Tatsumaki-class without pulling a tatsumaki Blue Nose Clipperships went about creating the Whirlwind-class. This ship, while lacking anti-aircraft armament on several important vectors, was considered a success. Thus the design would continue serving for years until most of their number wound up destroyed by enemy airpower."
 FAT_destroyer_6:0 "Lola Class"
 FAT_destroyer_6_short:0 "Lola Class"
 FAT_destroyer_6_desc:0 "Designed for escort and picket duty the Lola-class was an excellent design whose only downside was a lack of crewspace. As the crews of these vessels were always quick to point out though, they would rather be cramped and uncomfortable than dead and dying. The Republican admiralty obviously agreed, and the design would see no less than three revisions that kept the design a recognizable name for many years after the global war."
 FAT_destroyer_7:0 "Davion Class"
 FAT_destroyer_7_short:0 "Davion Class"
 FAT_destroyer_7_desc:0 "The first block of Davion-class destroyers were a classic case of both political corruption and design by committee, leading to a ship so bad the only praise people had for it was, ‘at least it’s not a SoySoy.’ Seeing potential in the design though, one aspiring engineer went back to the drawing board and reworked the ship from stem to stern. After convincing his superiors to make a prototype vessel the so-called Davion II-class was soon able to prove itself one of the most capable vessels in the fleet."
 FAT_light_cruiser_1:0 "Riga I Class"
 FAT_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Designed to cover the often overlooked role of destroyer flotilla leader the Riga-class filled that role admirably. So admirable was the ship in the role that it would serve in that role alongside even its replacements."
 FAT_light_cruiser_2:0 "Kyushu Class"
 FAT_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Designed to support in the transport and defense of invasion forces, the Kyushu-class features a staggering array of anti-aircraft arminents backed up by a not insubstantial number of main battery guns. Filling its designated role so well one would perhaps be shocked to learn that the design was taken from a merchant marine vessel, but that’s exactly where it came from."
 FAT_light_cruiser_3:0 "Eagle Class"
 FAT_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "Designed as an escort for the Thera-class carrier, the Eagle-class light cruiser had the majority of its capabilities designed around the much larger carrier. For instance, the original design notes for the vessel list its speed as ‘30% faster than the Thera-class.’ Despite the odd method of design though, the ship would serve well until a critical flaw was discovered in its life support systems that would result in the entire class being recalled to port for an immediate overhaul."
 FAT_light_cruiser_4:0 "Quixote Class"
 FAT_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Quixote-class, named for a kindly but insane nobleman, was yet another horrorshow of Republican procurement. Originally designed as a battlecrusier, the design was downgraded to cut costs multiple times until all that that was left was a light cruiser too slow to meet many battlefield roles, and to compound the error various factions within the government bought the class by the flotilla. In an attempt to get some use out of the class the admiralty ordered them converted to so-called ‘torpedo escorts’ until they could be replaced."
 FAT_light_cruiser_5:0 "Dante Class"
 FAT_light_cruiser_5_short:0 "Dante Class"
 FAT_light_cruiser_5_desc:0 "Designed to fill the roll of destroyer flotilla leader, the Dante-class features a good mix of speed, maneuverability, and firepower that makes it useful for raiding tactics. Unfortunately for the Dante-class, politics and budget cuts would conspire to see the ships languish for years until eventually being revived for a new purpose."
 FAT_light_cruiser_6:0 "Congress Class"
 FAT_light_cruiser_6_short:0 "Congress Class"
 FAT_light_cruiser_6_desc:0 "Named for the famous Congress of the Griffonian Republic, the Congress-class was conceived as a response to the boondoggle of the Quixote-class. As a result of this philosophy the ship is one of the fastest light cruisers of the era, and features an impressive gun arminent. Not to skip on tradition though, the class would be mired in production difficulties due to a lawsuit from a shipyard in another nation over industrial espionage charges."
 FAT_light_cruiser_7:0 "Wagon Wheel Class"
 FAT_light_cruiser_7_short:0 "Wagon Wheel Class"
 FAT_light_cruiser_7_desc:0 "Named for the wagon trains so iconic to the frontier spirit the Griffonian Republic wished to embrace, the Wagon Wheel-class started out life as a transport. Despite the design’s origins the vessels would be rapidly redesigned and reconfigured while still undergoing construction into heavily armed fast attack ships. In a complete contradiction of form this would turn out well for the Griffonian Republican Navy, and the vessels would serve well, even if it was in drastically reduced numbers."
 FAT_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Cruiser Class"
 FAT_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Manufactured during the same era as contemporaries such as the Aegis-class heavy cruiser, Black Lion I-class battlecruiser, and Dreadnought-class battleship as part of the Griffonian Empire’s modernization program of 960, legend has it that the Cruiser-class was named by a committee headed by Captain Hobb V. Ess. Regardless of its name, and the poor design born from ignorance of ironclad combat, Chief of the Imperial General Staff James McHenna found them usable for the fleet’s campaigns, and when Marshall Keremeskai brought the bulk of the Imperial Fleet in exile he wasn’t picky enough to care about its shortcomings."
 FAT_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Aegis Class"
 FAT_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Aegis-class heavy cruiser is one of the oldest ironclad warships still in service, having first been been laid down in 961. It is a design that has proven itself time and time again thanks to the modularity of the design allowing for extensive upgrades to be made to keep it at the very peak of military modernity. The RNS Aegis of today is almost unrecognizable as the same ship laid down almost 50 years ago."
 FAT_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Sovetskii Soyuz Class"
 FAT_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "While publically meant as part of a massive modernization program the Sovetskii Soyuz-class, nicknamed the SoySoy, quickly gained a reputation for being one of the worst ship designs ever made. It was a massive ship that was undergunned, underarmored, and under-engined, but with an oversized cargo capacity and the ability for easy mass production. The ships and their crews were mocked by other cruiser crews, destroyer crews, and the merchant marine. Nevertheless the crews of the ships feel that they proved themselves as Q-ships against Zebrican pirates."
 FAT_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Avatar Class"
 FAT_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Designed as a successor to the venerable Aegis-class the Avatar-class was beloved by its crews for its excellent balance of heavy guns, secondary guns, torpedoes, and anti-aircraft batteries, even if shipyards were never to fix the problem of electrical systems randomly shorting out without cause. The Avatar-class would serve the Republican Navy for years, even serving alongside its alleged replacement."
 FAT_heavy_cruiser_5:0 "Agamemnon Class"
 FAT_heavy_cruiser_5_short:0 "Agamemnon Class"
 FAT_heavy_cruiser_5_desc:0 "Designed in response to the failures of the Sovetskii Soyuz-class, the Agamemnon-class features reduced armor but weapons comparable to the Black Lion II-class battlecruiser and speed that is in a league of its own. Its abilities have led to entire squadrons of the Republican Navy being based around such vessels."
 FAT_heavy_cruiser_6:0 "Luxor Class"
 FAT_heavy_cruiser_6_short:0 "Luxor Class"
 FAT_heavy_cruiser_6_desc:0 "When the Republic called for a replacement for the beloved Avatar-class Mitchell Vehicles answered with a design that they had already been building, the Luxor-class. A scandal erupted when the CEO of Blue Nose Clipperships used his own influence in the government to ensure that the Luxor-class would win out the design competition over the Soyal-class. In an ironic turn of events, the Luxors would end up being used as decoys for enemy fleets so Soyals could aim better."
 FAT_heavy_cruiser_7:0 "Soyal Class"
 FAT_heavy_cruiser_7_short:0 "Soyal Class"
 FAT_heavy_cruiser_7_desc:0 "The lovechild, almost literally, of physicist Dr. Nicholas Grovland and industrialist-magician Waveform Steamer of Delhi Shipyards, the Soyal-class is perhaps the most advanced and oddest warship ever designed. Outmassing most battleships, the Soyal is based around a heavily modified railway gun designed to fire a one ton shell at more than three times the speed of sound to ranges that are still classified. While its development was racked with controversy at the start, the Soyal has emerged a success with the tagline of ‘love is justice."
 FAT_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Black Lion II Class"
 FAT_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Named for the famous Imperial Chief of the General Staff James McHenna’s flagship, the Black Lion II-class is the successor to that famous battlecruiser line and saw a minor scandal erupt when someone attempted to call it the class the Black Lion-class while remaining the original battlecruisers to the Black Lion I-class. This was thankfully overridden by President Keremeskai himself as ‘too confusing.’ Scandals aside, the Black Lion II-class performed splendidly against  its opponents in the field."
 FAT_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Defender Class"
 FAT_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "A foreign contemporary of the old Dreadnaught-class battleships, the Defender-class battlecruisers have been rebought and refit by the Griffonian Republic to save on costs. While underarmored for their size the Defender-class maintains a large amount of speed and an impressive main battery of guns, meaning the ships can stay in the fight for long periods of time and do heavy damage just as long as they don’t get shot."
 FAT_battle_cruiser_3:0 "Cameron Class"
 FAT_battle_cruiser_3_short:0 "Cameron Class"
 FAT_battle_cruiser_3_desc:0 "While the Republican Navy has suffered a large number of boondoggles in its lifetime perhaps none are so famous as the Cameron-class, the Widowmakers. Conceived as the magnum opus of ship design, able to replace every single cruiser and battleship in service at the time, the ships that set sail were death traps for their crews. An extensive investigation, media outcry, and refit program would see the design eventually end up as a sluggish second line command vessel."
 FAT_battleship_1:0 "Dreadnaught Class"
 FAT_battleship_1_desc:0 "The grandfather of all warship designs currently sailing the seas today, the Dreadnought-class battleship was used by Imperial Chief of the General Staff James McHenna to leverage for a modernization of the Griffonian Imperial Navy by destroying a deceptively small island using the ship’s guns. In the current era the ship class is mostly known as a popular museum ship, with the Dreadnought herself being captained by one Captain Gaff for just that roll."
 FAT_battleship_2:0 "Atreus Class"
 FAT_battleship_2_desc:0 "Designed following the Dreadnought-class, the Atreus-class battleship would quickly find itself synonymous with one word: excellence. Against all foes, and in all environments the Atreus-class proved itself again and again. It is no wonder then that Keremeskai took as many of the ships with him as he could when leaving the Empire."
 FAT_battleship_3:0 "Du Shi Wang Class"
 FAT_battleship_3_desc:0 "An older design from the days of the Empire that was not put into service till after its collapse, the Du Shi Wang-class was named after a famous immigrant from Zebrica to the empire. A problem child from the start, the Du Shi Wang-class was plagued by problems related to the ‘counterrevolutionary’ crew quarters of the ship being laid out by class instead of what their job was. Nevertheless, the ship gained a reputation for being ridiculously though, with the bow of one ship famously taking a direct hit from the GRS Soyal and surviving."
 FAT_battleship_4:0 "Monsoon Class"
 FAT_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Monsoon-class was the original attempt to improve upon the Dreadnaught-class, and it was such a standard-setter that the admiralty did their best to keep the ship in operation for many years despite it being outclassed by virtually every design since. This design in particular was the final attempt to restore these aging battleships. No more refits would be ordered after these."
 FAT_battleship_5:0 "Farragut Class"
 FAT_battleship_5_short:0 "Farragut Class"
 FAT_battleship_5_desc:0 "Designed as a showcase of new technology designed since the Exodus of Republican forces from Griffonia proper, the Farragut-class battleships are an impressive display of just that. Featuring improved radios, radar, and fire control the Farraguts have gained a reputation as some of the most powerful battleships sailing the seas today. Nevertheless, a combination of price hikes and the introduction of even more technologies would see the class replaced."
 FAT_battleship_6:0 "Texas Class"
 FAT_battleship_6_short:0 "Texas Class"
 FAT_battleship_6_desc:0 "While not the biggest battleship ever introduced the Texas-class nevertheless managed to make a splash when it first hit the waves. Featuring a good blend of speed, firepower, and armor the Texas was able to fill the niche of the ‘fast battleship’ well. Captains in command of this vessel were therefore advised to utilize their speed to make up for their lack in arminents, featuring only three double-barreled 15” turrets with eight Killer Whale torpedo launchers."
 FAT_battleship_7:0 "McKenna Class"
 FAT_battleship_7_short:0 "McKenna Class"
 FAT_battleship_7_desc:0 "The pride of the Griffonian Republican Navy, and perhaps the most produced battleship in history, the McKenna-class rose above the ‘ink blot scandal’ to become one of the most deservedly famous designs around. Featuring three superfiring 18” triple-barreled gun turrets, six torpedo turrets, and more secondary arms than one can shake a stick at the McKenna is truly impressive. So impressive was this vessel class in fact that Keremeskai himself moved his flag to the GRS McHenna’s Pride upon the ship’s completion."
 FAT_battleship_nuc:0 "Nightlord Class"
 FAT_battleship_nuc_short:0 "Nightlord Class"
 FAT_battleship_nuc_desc:0 "How does one improve upon perfection? If the Nightlord-class battleship is anything to go by then you start with a nuclear reactor and then use only the latest and greatest technology. The results can not be denied, but at the same time many observers point out that the ship’s prohibitive costs will limit the number produced. That is perhaps why ‘you can’t put a price on perfection’ is the marketing line for this vessel."
 FAT_SH_battleship_1:0 "Republic Class"
 FAT_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "Originally called the Stefan Amaris-class, the Republic-class super battleships were pilliaged from a horrid imperialist by Republican forces during the Exodus and consequently renamed to a more patriotic flavor. The ships were eventually refurbished to meet with additional modernization demands from the Republic government."
 FAT_SH_battleship_2:0 "Leviathan II Class"
 FAT_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The original Leviathan-class super battleships were turned into transports to assist in evacuation efforts. Thus, with the Leviathan II-class super battleship Blue Nose Clipperships decided to redo the design as it was meant to be. According to the admiralty, they did an adequate job."
 FAT_SH_battleship_3:0 "Leviathan III Class"
 FAT_SH_battleship_3_short:0 "Leviathan III Class"
 FAT_SH_battleship_3_desc:0 "The largest and most expensive warship ever produced, the new and modernized Leviathan III-class super battleship is advertised as the final word in naval dominance. Featuring four triple-barreled 18” superfiring turrets, three heavy torpedo turrets mirrored on the port and starboard sides, and the thickest AAA and strongest all-around protection of any warship currently sailing it certainly seems to fit the bill. The only downside is its range."
 FAT_carrier_1:0 "Conqueror Class"
 FAT_carrier_1_desc:0 "One of the strangest looking ships ever put into the water, the Conqueror-class aircraft carrier eventually become the basis for many future Griffonian designs. Carrying 45 aircraft of varying types, the Conqueror-class was an excellent first step in the quest for naval airpower by the griffons."
 FAT_carrier_2:0 "York Class"
 FAT_carrier_2_desc:0 "A refit of the venerable Riga I-class light cruiser, the York-class carrier was designed in the aftermath of the Exodus. Carrying 55 aircraft, the York-class was a worthy successor to the Riga I-class, and a true boon to the naval air arm. Interestingly enough, the York-class maintained much of its anti-aircraft armament, making it a terror for enemy torpedo bombers."
 FAT_carrier_3:0 "Thera Class"
 FAT_carrier_3_desc:0 "Designed in conjunction with the Eagle-class light cruiser, the Thera-class carrier carries 70 aircraft in order to achieve complete air-sea superiority. Not only did it achieve that goal, but the designers were also able to pack in a number of nasty surprises for any who go up against it. This includes but is not limited to a full company of marines, all of whom house housed within some of the most comfortable lodgings of any warship out there."
 FAT_carrier_4:0 "Samerkind I Class"
 FAT_carrier_4_desc:0 "85 aircraft make up the complement of the first block of the Samerkind-class carriers, making them some of the most terrifying aircraft dispensers in the world at the time of their introduction. These ships are notable not only for their impressive compliment of aircraft, but also for the economic boom they brought to Republican lands upon their construction. This economic prosperity would extend long past construction as, after being retired from military service, the Samerkinds were converted to cargo and passenger transports."
 FAT_carrier_5:0 "Samerkind II Class"
 FAT_carrier_5_short:0 "Samerkind II Class"
 FAT_carrier_5_desc:0 "The primary addition to the second block of Samerkind-class carriers was the addition of 10 more aircraft to bring the complement up to 95, but this wasn’t all that was improved. Additional improvements included a new radar system, better engines, and more armor. While the Block IIs did not bring quite the economic prosperity that their predecessors did, they are nonetheless iconic."
 FAT_carrier_6:0 "Kitty Hawk Class"
 FAT_carrier_6_short:0 "Kitty Hawk Class"
 FAT_carrier_6_desc:0 "When insulting the CEO of a Griffonian shipbuilding company it is generally advised not to do it in such a way that he gets an idea for a new product. That was the mythological origins of the Kitty Hawk-class carrier, a ship that caused no end of controversy when it was first unveiled. Some were horribly insulted, others found it humorous to the point of hysterics, while still others tried to strike it from the naval record. Nevertheless, it existed, two were made, and both served with distinction."
 FAT_carrier_7:0 "New Syrtis Class"
 FAT_carrier_7_short:0 "New Syrtis Class"
 FAT_carrier_7_desc:0 "The New Syrtis-class carrier was designed to fit the requirement for direct fleet action in support of fleet elements such as battleships and heavy cruisers. To achieve the mission parameters the vessel was extensively armored and equipped with a variety of anti-ship weapons. Interestingly, the vessel also carries a flight crew double what its aircraft compliment actually is, this was done to allow for 24/7 combat air patrol."
 FAT_carrier_nuc:0 "Enterprise Class"
 FAT_carrier_nuc_short:0 "Enterprise Class"
 FAT_carrier_nuc_desc:0 "Conceived as the final word in supercarrier design, the Enterprise-class is one of the contenders for ‘worst boondoggle in Republican Navy history.’ The ship had more than 12 companies working on it over the course of its five year development cycle, and each one brought their own team of engineers and a new set of requirements. By the time it was time for the ship to launch even the new nuclear power plant of the vessel was unable to move it. The extremely public debace resulted in the resignation of at least one admiral."
 FAT_light_carrier_1:0 "Leopard CV Class"
 FAT_light_carrier_1_desc:0 "Featuring a small squadron of aircraft as its complement, the Leopard CV-class escort carrier is a derivative of the Leopard-class transport, as the name suggests. It was designed to be cheap, mass producible, and easy to maintain. Remarkably, it was not only to achieve those goals, it was able to become one of the most common light carriers in existence. Both private and public forces use this ship to great effect."
 FAT_light_carrier_2:0 "Titan Class"
 FAT_light_carrier_2_desc:0 "The design specifications for the Titan-class escort carrier called for a full battalion of aircraft for its complement. When it was pointed out that this didn’t make sense the number of 32 aircraft was agreed upon instead. In service the Titan-class gained a reputation among pilots as the best posting they could get, with spacious accommodations, a large flight deck, and superior CAG facilities."
 FAT_light_carrier_3:0 "Vengeance Class"
 FAT_light_carrier_3_desc:0 "42 is the meaning of life, the universe, and everything for the crew of the Vengeance-class escort carrier. This complement of aircraft makes it almost as big as the old Conqueror-class, and it is something that everyone involved was well aware of. The Vengeance-class is seen not just as a capable vessel in its own right, but also as a mark of pride for the Republican Navy to show how far they had come."
 FAT_submarine_1:0 "Mako Class"
 FAT_submarine_1_desc:0 "The first submersible produced by the Griffonian Republic, the Mako-class was meant to fill the role of the corvette but in a much more stealthy fashion. It was a design requirement that did not work out well in simulation, so in a shocking turn of events they started over. The resulting submarine was extremely good at both commerce raiding and long range international operations, a winning design."
 FAT_submarine_2:0 "Fredasa Class"
 FAT_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Fredasa-class was the second attempt by the Republican Navy to innovate in the realm of submersible design, this time creating a picket ship. However, when the vessel was first spotted by foreign intelligence agencies they performed a careful analysis of it and came to the conclusion that it was a fast moving raider. Republican intelligence in turn picked up on this and relayed it to the navy, who decided that their enemies were right and reclassified the Fredasa-class."
 FAT_submarine_3:0 "Vincent Class"
 FAT_submarine_3_desc:0 "The first venture by the foreign based Delhi Shipyards into the Republican market, the Vincent-class was made to have the longest range sonar of any submarine yet produced. That, along with the ability to install modular upgrades to the design as needed, provided the basis for a long life for the class. Shipping under the command of the Republic’s enemies’ soon learned to fear the vessel and its many Barracuda torpedoes."
 FAT_submarine_4:0 "Bonaventure Class"
 FAT_submarine_4_desc:0 "A typical attempt by the Griffonian Republic to revive an aging design, the Bonaventure-class would see far less success than other ships that underwent a similar process. The problems lay in the simple fact that the vessel was too noisy and too lightly armed for the battlefield it now found itself in. All in all only a few Bonaventure-class vessels would be refurbished before the design was replaced."
 FAT_submarine_5:0 "Pinto Class"
 FAT_submarine_5_short:0 "Pinto Class"
 FAT_submarine_5_desc:0 "Sporting double the armament of Barracudas as the earlier Vincent-class one would think that the Pinto-class would become notable for its firepower. Instead, the Pinto-class became famous for falling through the cracks, with many examples ending up in the navies of foreign nations through a suspicious lack of paperwork."
 FAT_submarine_6:0 "Inazuma Class"
 FAT_submarine_6_short:0 "Inazuma Class"
 FAT_submarine_6_desc:0 "The Inazuma-class submarine was designed to strike like lightning, hence the name. To this possible it utilized a bevy of forward-facing weapons, and the largest engines ever put into a submarine up to that point. It was a design that seemed on the track to greatness till the shipyards where it was being constructed blew up. Taking it as a divine sign the owners of the shipyard increased security and refitted the shipyard to only supply, not build."
 FAT_submarine_7:0 "Zechetinu Class"
 FAT_submarine_7_short:0 "Zechetinu Class"
 FAT_submarine_7_desc:0 "One of the smallest and lightest warships of its era, the Zechetinu-class was also one of its most capable. Nicknamed the Zec, the vessel was small and cramped and as such only a month away from port was the norm to keep crews sane. The new diesel-electric engine allowed for unparalleled quietness and speed, and its White Shark torpedo complement ensured a swift end for its enemies."
 FAT_submarine_nuc:0 "Fox Class"
 FAT_submarine_nuc_short:0 "Fox Class"
 FAT_submarine_nuc_desc:0 "The Fox-class was originally designated the RX-78 and was the first nuclear powered submarine produced by the Griffonian Republic. In typical Republican Navy fashion the design was beset by delays, this time by foreign actors, but the shipyard staff were able to rise above it all and produce a vessel that could stay underwater for months and travel around the world to deliver a massive barrage of 8 forward facing Barracuda torpedoes to its targets."

 EQS_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Class"
 EQS_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."

These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."

 EQS_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 EQS_battleship_3:0 "Lion Class"

Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have had thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 EQS_battleship_4:0 "Vanguard Class"
 EQS_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Vanguard-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theater. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Program, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament is the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armor made the vessel fast and well protected."

Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 EQS_SH_battleship_2:0 "Lion II Class"
 EQS_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."

 EQS_carrier_1:0 "Courageous Class"
 EQS_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement is limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 EQS_carrier_2:0 "Ark Royal Class"
 EQS_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She is the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel is well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 EQS_carrier_3:0 "Illustrious Class"
 EQS_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Illustrious class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armored flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."
 EQS_carrier_4:0 "Implacable Class"
 EQS_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Implacable-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Program and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armor on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious class."

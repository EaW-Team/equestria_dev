### Ideas ###
FEA_crashed_economy:0 "Ruined Economy"
FEA_crashed_economy_desc:0 "Feathisia has always been one of the richest constituent states of the Griffonian Empire, with flourishing trade and adventurous explorers bringing the Duchy great wealth. The nigh constant warfare across the continent that followed the crumbling of the Griffonian Empire had pushed the economy to the brink. Now Skyfall, Feathisia's greatest trading partner, has fallen into chaos, with the bankruptcy of the firms that traded with the Trade Federation causing a ripple effect through the economy. Dealing with the economy should be the first priority of the Feathisian government."
FEA_beloved_monarch:0 "Duke Gerlach the Silent"
FEA_beloved_monarch_desc:0 "Grand Duke Gerlach IV Weijermars is known far and wide as one of the most reasonable leaders in Griffonia. The Duke, who earned his nickname 'The Silent' for his patience and calm, transformed his fief into the very first proper Constitutional Monarchy in Griffonia. The people of Feathisia love their Grand Duke and as long as he keeps listening to the concerns of his Griffons, this is unlikely to change."
FEA_danger_in_the_coalition:0 "Crisis in the Coalition"
FEA_danger_in_the_coalition_desc:0 "The recent economic troubles plaguing Feathisia have lead to a divide between the ruling FHP-LDP Coalition, and allowed for more extreme parties to gain prominence within the Parliament. If the issues within the Coalition are not addressed properly it could lead to a general collapse of the Government."
FEA_gov_inter:0 "Ruined Economy"
FEA_gov_inter_desc:0 "Feathisia has always been one of the richest constituent states of the Griffonian Empire, with flourishing trade and adventurous explorers bringing the Duchy great wealth. The nigh constant warfare across the continent that followed the crumbling of the Griffonian Empire had pushed the economy to the brink. Now Skyfall, Feathisia's greatest trading partner, has fallen into chaos, with the bankruptcy of the firms that traded with the Trade Federation causing a ripple effect through the economy. Dealing with the economy should be the first priority of the Feathisian government."
FEA_free_mark:0 "Ruined Economy"
FEA_free_mark_desc:0 "Feathisia has always been one of the richest constituent states of the Griffonian Empire, with flourishing trade and adventurous explorers bringing the Duchy great wealth. The nigh constant warfare across the continent that followed the crumbling of the Griffonian Empire had pushed the economy to the brink. Now Skyfall, Feathisia's greatest trading partner, has fallen into chaos, with the bankruptcy of the firms that traded with the Trade Federation causing a ripple effect through the economy. Dealing with the economy should be the first priority of the Feathisian government."
FEA_sluggish_economy:0 "Sluggish Economy"
FEA_sluggish_economy_desc:0 "While our economic reforms have managed to find quite a bit of success Feathisia's economy is still yet to fully recover. While the worst is now over, we still need to pull through and finish our reforms, if we want to get back to pre-crisis growth levels. The worst is over and it should be uphill from here. Our economic analysts are mildly optimistic and soon the treasurer might no longer have to say no to every other minister who comes to ask for a bigger budget."
FEA_banker_support:0 "Banker Support"
FEA_banker_support_desc:0 "Our decision to bailout the suffering banks within our borders, both Feathisian and International, had a side effect that may not have been entirely intentional. The Griffonian financial elite has heard of our 'reasonable' policies and has decided to support us. It can never hurt to have some friends who fly in high places."
FEA_worker_right_idea:0 "Arbeidswetten"
FEA_worker_right_idea_desc:0 "The Arbeidswetten, more commonly known to international observers as the Feathisian Labour Laws, are a package of laws designed to protect the rights of the working Griffon. It contains laws for fair wages, workplace protection and working hours."
FEA_free_healthcare_idea:0 "Algemeen Ziekenfonds"
FEA_free_healthcare_idea_desc:0 "The General Sickfund is the national health insurance of Feathisia. Although wealthier Feathisians can still insure themselves privately, the Feathisian government now makes it possible for those poorest Griffons to get an insurance for themselves. Instead of giving a compensation to patients, the Sick Fund pays the bills directly, with the sick or injured workers never seeing a single bill. Even the way the fund is financed is a unique Feathisian compromise, with the worker paying some part directly, paying a percentage of their income and the employers also chipping in themselves."
FEA_mass_contruction_projects:0 "Arbeidsplan"
FEA_mass_contruction_projects_desc:0 "To keep every Griffon working in these trying times, great public projects should be undertaken. Your education or background does not matter, every claw can hold a shovel! Be they parks, canals or bridges, we will find some project to work on for our jobless."
FEA_citizen_welfare:0 "Sociaal-Economische Raad"
FEA_citizen_welfare_desc:0 "The Socio-Economic Council is an idea proposed by the various different factions in the parliament. In it, trade unions and employers' organisations meet together to try and find common grounds. The council had a rough start, but they are slowly getting used to cooperating, which will surely lead to both fairer working rights and less strikes. The Griffons of Feathisia are learning that compromise can find a solution that works for all parties."
FEA_agrarian_idea:0 "Agrarisme"
FEA_agrarian_idea_desc:0 "We have embraced the philosophy of agrarianism. The Griffon who works the earth is a true Feathisian. We will promote a simple life in the countryside as an important part of our culture and create a class of loyal farmers as the backbone of our nation."
FEA_labour_battalion_ideas:0 "Arbeidersbataljons"
FEA_labour_battalion_ideas_desc:0 "Patriotic unemployed Griffons have been assigned to the Workers battalions. These groups will be used to quickly complete certain projects. Construction projects of vital importance and of course repairs to damaged factories and infrastructure. Additionally, contingents of these Griffons will be placed under command of our engineers to help entrench our troops. Any Griffon who will fall in service of their battalion will receive a medal."
FEA_state_union:0 "Staatsvakbond"
FEA_state_union_desc:0 "The State Union is a way to finally stop the influence of the meddling labour unions. By having labour under state control, we have made more straightforward regulations and wage contracts that favour us. This has increased our production, with only an acceptable loss in labour conditions."
FEA_farmer_funds:0 "Farmer-Fonds"
FEA_farmer_funds_desc:0 "We have created a fund to subsidise our primary sector, most importantly our farmers. With a bit of government help, farms and mines are now using the wonders of modern machinery to better extract resources. The popular measure has not only given us greater access to the wealth under our soil, it has also helped shore up political support for the government."
FEA_lightning_warfare:0 "Mobiele-Oorlogsvoering"
FEA_lightning_warfare_desc:0 "Our army has embraced mobile warfare. Bold and as quick as greased lightning, our armed forces will outmanoeuver our foes. If our troops can move quickly, we can pick our battles and beat a larger army."
FEA_car_factories:0 "Entrop Manufacturing"
FEA_car_factories_desc:0 "A massive investment into Entrop Manufacturing has allowed us to set up their new production lines ourselves. Specifically tooled for military vehicles, their plants will churn out the tanks and trucks we will need to succeed in our war of movement."
FEA_lightning_warfare_2:0 "Mobiele-Oorlogsvoering"
FEA_lightning_warfare_2_desc:0 "Our army has mastered mobile warfare. Our tanks move faster than greased lightning, surprising and overpowering our stunned foes. Our officers have learned that our speed will allow them tactical superiority to surround and crush our opposition."
FEA_superior_idea:0 "Overweldigende Vuurkracht"
FEA_superior_idea_desc:0 "We have adopted the doctrine of superior firepower. Our army will focus on shooting as many shells and bullets to the enemy as possible. This will require a greater focus on logistics and tactical use of artillery. When our enemies are blasted into a thousand pieces, victory will merely be a formality."
FEA_artillery_factories:0 "Artillerie-Werken"
FEA_artillery_factories_desc:0 "Our national Artillery-Works will produce the field artillery we need to overpower our foes. A special factory tuned to make the howitzers and field cannons of our expanding arsenal. Arcturius is on the side with the best artillery, after all."
FEA_spec_ops_initiative:0 "Commandotroepen"
FEA_spec_ops_initiative_desc:0 "We have founded the Commandotroops. This special corps trains for extraordinary terrain and weather and with the most exotic of armaments. They are the dagger that compliments the hammer of our artillery."
FEA_superior_idea_2:0 "Overweldigende Vuurkracht"
FEA_superior_idea_2_desc:0 " We have mastered the doctrine of superior firepower. Our army is trained to lob as many shells and bullets to the enemy as possible. Our commanders have honed their focus on logistics and tactical use of artillery. Our enemies will be blasted into a million pieces and victory is inevitable."
FEA_grand_idea:0 "Groot Strijdplan"
FEA_grand_idea_desc:0 "We have opted for the trusty doctrine of the Grand Battleplan. It is easier for us to train a larger army while using the tried and true tactics of the last millennium, but we shouldn't expect miracles. In that regard, we have decided to mostly draft defensive strategies. Let the enemy break themselves on our meticulously crafted battle lines, we will simply lie in wait."
FEA_specialised_staff:0 "Specialised Staff"
FEA_specialised_staff_desc:0 "Now that we have familiarised ourselves with grand strategy, we have a large capable officer corps available for our army. In fact, we can assign extra aides and staff to assist the generals with planning. Four eyes see more than two, this should help further improve our planning."
FEA_grand_idea_2:0 "Groot Strijdplan"
FEA_grand_idea_2_desc:0 " We have mastered the trusty doctrine of the Grand Battleplan. We have been able to train many recruits in the wisdom of the last millennium. We have trained for many strategic defensive positions. The enemy will break on our impenetrably crafted battle lines, all we have to do is wait."
FEA_mass_idea:0 "Massa-Aanval"
FEA_mass_idea_desc:0 "We have made the uncomfortable decision of adapting the Mass Assault doctrine. Our army has faced the reality that we must train every able-bodied Griffon we can find if we are to stand a chance against the enemies that surround us. With streamlined logistics and training ensure that we can match the armies of states with a larger population."
FEA_mass_idea_2:0 "Massa-aanval"
FEA_mass_idea_2_desc:0 " We have adapted to the Mass Assault doctrine. The reality is that every able-bodied Griffon can fight if they must. Our officers are no longer ashamed, but proud of the common soldier and have learned to adapt. With good coordination we merely have to point and a wave of determined soldiers will flood our opponents."
FEA_naval_academy:0 "De Vlootacademie"
FEA_naval_academy_desc:0 "The Fleet Academy was, when the Griffonian Empire still stretched the continent, the pride of Feathisia. Here the most brilliant minds of the age would be turned into captains and admirals. The Academy is now open again and many cadets have signed up to become the core of a new age of Feathisian naval pride."
FEA_great_fleet:0 "De Grote Vloot"
FEA_great_fleet_desc:0 "Feathisian ships now proudly sail the free seas, our flag high in the mast! The Grand Fleet protects our trade lanes with unmatched courage. None of this would be possible, however, without our master shipwrights and designers. A few small details make all the difference, so that our battleships are the most efficient war machines on the big blue ocean."
FEA_naval_air_fleet:0 "Marine Luchtvaart"
FEA_naval_air_fleet_desc:0 "Feathisian carriers are a true marvel of engineering. Our pilots and sailors are both proud to serve on the gargantuan ships. De Marine Luchtvaart, or Naval Aviation branch of our armed forces is turning out to be one of the most popular. We are able to be pickier for recruits who get to pilot our carrier planes and this has made our carriers an even more terrifying foe than they already are."
FEA_beloved_monarch_2:0 "Duke Gerlach the Silent"
FEA_beloved_monarch_2_desc:0 "Grand Duke Gerlach IV Weijermars is known far and wide as one of the most reasonable leaders in Griffonia. The Duke, who earned his nickname 'The Silent' for his patience and calm, transformed his fief into the very first proper Constitutional Monarchy in Griffonia. The people of Feathisia love their Grand Duke and as long as he keeps listening to the concerns of his Griffons, this is unlikely to change"
FEA_aerial_superioriy:0 "Vliegende Luipaarden"
FEA_aerial_superioriy_desc:0 "The Flying Leopards are the best pilots in our air fleet. Every Griffon boy has a poster of them in their room with their signature motto; 'Small in number, large in merit!' By both learning from and excessively advertising the success of the Leopards, they inspire all pilots to be even more bold in their dogfights."
FEA_strat_bombing_ideas:0 "Strategische Vernietiging"
FEA_strat_bombing_ideas_desc:0 "Our bombers are the battleships of the sky. We use them like a fleet, bombarding the enemy below. Our airmen have grown adept at using the large machines to battle even smaller and nimbler fighter planes, while the air force has developed advanced targeting to make sure every bomb hits the target for maximum impact."
FEA_unfunctional_government:0 "Governmental Crisis"
FEA_unfunctional_government_desc:0 "The so called Regency Debate has managed to tear any semblance of order in the Feathisian Parliament to pieces. As long standing grudges, dissatisfaction with the ruling coalition's policies and general dissatisfaction with the government have all finally reached a boiling point."
FEA_beloved_monarch_3:0 "Duke Gerlach the Silent"
FEA_beloved_monarch_3_desc:0 "Grand Duke Gerlach IV Weijermars is known far and wide as one of the most reasonable leaders in Griffonia. The Duke, who earned his nickname 'The Silent' for his patience and calm, transformed his fief into the very first proper Constitutional Monarchy in Griffonia. The people of Feathisia love their Grand Duke and as long as he keeps listening to the concerns of his Griffons, this is unlikely to change"
FEA_unfunctional_government_2:0 "Governmental Crisis"
FEA_unfunctional_government_2_desc:0 "The so called Regency Debate has managed to tear any semblance of order in the Feathisian Parliament to pieces. As long standing grudges, dissatisfaction with the ruling coalition's policies and general dissatisfaction with the government have all finally reached a boiling point."
FEA_FHP_PvdA_coalition:0 "FHP-PvdA Coalition"
FEA_FHP_PvdA_coalition_desc:0 "Perhaps by some cosmic accident or through sheer pragmatism the FHP and the PvdA have managed to form a coalition between their two parties"
FEA_LDP_FNV_coalition:0 "LDP-FNV Coalition"

FEA_proper_welfare:0 "Nationaal Welzijnsprogramma"
FEA_proper_welfare_desc:0 "The National Well-being Program will ensure that every citizen has a minimum of protection. No Griffon shall go hungry or sleep without a roof over their heads. This way we ensure the loyalty and gratitude of the people of Feathisia, who deserve our best efforts."
FEA_youth_group_idea:0 "Jeugdwind"
FEA_youth_group_idea_desc:0 "The Youthwind has been the youth-wing of the FNV for some time. The organisation promotes patriotism and loyalty to the state. With the FNV party in charge, it has been promoted to a government organisation. With increased funding the Jeugdwind can deliver a larger base of recruits for our military."
FEA_revived_nationalism_idea:0 "The Gold and Blue"
FEA_revived_nationalism_idea_desc:0 "The Gold and the Blue are the colours of our national flag. Now, finally after decades of downplaying the value of the nation, nationalism has finally returned to Feathisia. We are born under the Gold and Blue and by Boreas we will die for its honour if we have to."
FEA_feathisia_marches_on_idea:0 "Feathisia Marches On"
FEA_feathisia_marches_on_idea_desc:0 "Government by talk has finally been driven out in favour of a government of action. The FNV will make this grand country greater and more prosperous than ever before. We have not abandoned democracy, we are simply carrying out the will of the Feathisians.\n\nA great struggle lies before us against the forces of ruin and despair. But let us all proclaim; Feathisia is not finished. Feathisia is not dead! We will send all the world a message; Feathisia lives and marches on!"
FEA_paramilitary_troops:0 "Arendwachters"
FEA_paramilitary_troops_desc:0 "The Eagle Guards are the paramilitary units of the FNV. They started as an exercise outside the army, trained mostly by veterans who disliked the lack of funding for the proper armed forces. Highly motivated and loyal, the Arendwachters will make a nice addition to the Feathisian Army."
FEA_new_police_force_idea:0 "Korps Nationale Politie"
FEA_new_police_force_idea_desc:0 "The Feathisian Police Force used to be a collection of locally organised forces. That was great for knowing your local officer, but not very efficient. To cope with the challenges of a modern state and the crime it brings with it, the national police force has been organised from the local corps. All miscreants will learn that crime doesn't pay!"
FEA_ducal_guard:0 "Expanded Ducal Guard"
FEA_ducal_guard_desc:0 "The Ducal Guard is an organisation of loyal citizens who follow in the footsteps of Grand Duke Gerlach. All Feathisians who desire to follow this example must be brave, steadfast and have an unwavering devotion to the ideals of Constitutionalism and compromise. Together, these Griffons will guard not only the Grand Duke's life, but also his work and his values."
FEA_free_education:0 "De Leerplicht"
FEA_free_education_desc:0 "Under the mandatory learning act, all Griffon young are now sent to school. There will be no more homeschooling and no more children working in the fields. Now that all Griffons get an education, we are able to share our values and our knowledge. Both are indispensable for a modern state."
FEA_industrial_experts_idea:0 "Skilled Workers"
FEA_industrial_experts_idea_desc:0 "Our decision to make higher education available to more Griffons has led to an influx of skilled engineers and workers. This will mean our factories and construction companies will never have a shortage of experts."
FEA_defense_of_the_homeland:0 "In Defence of the Fatherland"
FEA_defense_of_the_homeland_desc:0 "A nation is measured by the worth of its norms, values and the willingness of her citizens to defend them. Feathisians fight for the values of tolerance and compromise.\nIf we are nationalist, we are nationalist because our nation has the values we share. If we are militarist, that is to defend that which we hold dear. We feel in our hearts and know in our minds that those who fight on the side of the Arcturius' truth and Eyr's justice will triumph over any foe."
FEA_pillarized_system:0 "Verzuiling"
FEA_pillarized_system_desc:0 "A peculiar system of social segregation has arisen in Feathisia. Championed by those who know different ideologies are here to stay, Pillarisation is a system in which all political parties get their own social sphere. These spheres have their own organisations, media and even sports clubs. To make sure the government keeps running, the leaders of all parties cooperate on the highest level.\nIt seems that every Griffon can be satisfied by just allowing them to form their own state within a state. These pillars that run vertically through society may seem strange to an outsider, but to a Feathisian, this seems perfectly normal."
FEA_new_army:0 "Loyal Army"
FEA_new_army_desc:0 "Those who join the Feathisian armed forces know what they are fighting for. They fight for the right to live their own life however they want. They do not deny others the right to do the same as well, even if that may be very different from their own ways. The overarching value is the freedom of choice, championed by the new coalition. That means the National Army can work together, even while every Griffon may have a different goal at home."
FEA_open_door_policy_idea:0 "Opendeurbeleid"
FEA_open_door_policy_idea_desc:0 "Feathisia has opted on an open door policy on immigration. The nation needs workers for her factories, and as such we have decided to not be picky on who occupies those jobs. Some might have concerns over unrestricted immigration, but good old Feathisian tolerance will incorporate these new cultures as well."
FEA_open_to_world_idea:0 "The World's Crossroad"
FEA_open_to_world_idea_desc:0 "Feathisia sits on the crossroad between nations. Trade has always been in our blood as our ships sailed the seas in ages past. We have rekindled that ancient traders' mentality and have become the World's Crossroad once again."
FEA_workshop_of_the_world_idea:0 "Workshop van de Wereld"
FEA_workshop_of_the_world_idea_desc:0 "All peoples of the world have heard of some sort of Feathisian product. Our factories turn to provide all the worlds' free nations with whichever their citizens might require. Feathisians take great pride in their international industry and our traders spread the word of our values far and wide. This in turns has an effect back home, where more Griffons start to stand up for the values we ship all over the world."
FEA_new_army_idea:0 "The New Feathisian Army"
FEA_new_army_idea_desc:0 "The Feathisian Army has always been a strong point for conservatism. Under the new coalition, this has been broken up, however. Young and enthusiastic left-wing Griffons can now more easily join the ranks and fight for our newfound equality."
FEA_socialist_education_idea:0 "Socialistische Opvoeding"
FEA_socialist_education_idea_desc:0 "There is a new wind blowing in our public school, it is the wind of progress! We have streamlined and improved the curriculum. This way all young Griffons will be made into citizens for a new age."
FEA_rising_star_idea:0 "The Rising Star"
FEA_rising_star_idea_desc:0 "In every factory the hymns of socialism are sung. On every field, the farmers now work in unison. In Feathisia we were wise enough to heed the call of a new age and forge a new path of equality. Many things are still left to be done, but all workers hope that Feathisia's rising star will proof that moderate socialism is the way forward to establish paradise on this green planet. The Feathisians can do it together!"
FEA_ruined_economy:0 "Ruined Economy"
FEA_ruined_economy_desc:0 "In spite of efforts to fix it, the brief and bloody Feathisian Civil War has managed to utterly destroy our economy. Again."
FEA_vanguardism_idea:0 "Revolutionaire Voorhoede"
FEA_vanguardism_idea_desc:0 "The theory of communism teaches us that a vanguard of intellectuals, who have grasped the truth about class warfare, must lead the proletariat in the struggle for communism. With the Labour Party fully in charge of the country, the vanguard can finally lead the way into a bright future."
FEA_organized_workers_idea:0 "Organised Workers"
FEA_organized_workers_idea_desc:0 "All labour is now unionised and organised by the party. This way we will ensure no Griffon will ever have to slave away in the factories. The people can finally enjoy the fruits of their labour themselves. And by the people we mean the state, of course."
FEA_communist_army_idea:0 "The FRL"
FEA_communist_army_idea_desc:0 "The Feathisian Revolutionary Army is the new name of our armed forces. The old duchy is gone and in its place stands the Workers' Republic. These brave Griffons will protect our newfound freedom with their lives!"
FEA_communal_farming_idea:0 "Landbouwcommunes"
FEA_communal_farming_idea_desc:0 "We have established Communal farming methods to better distribute the land amongst our farmers. These methods teach the socialist way to the countryside and increase the yield of our agriculture. No stomach will be left empty!"
FEA_communism_with_feathisian_characteristics_idea:0 "Communism with Feathisian Characteristics"
FEA_communism_with_feathisian_characteristics_idea_desc:0 "Feathisia is different and we have found a way to mix Stalliongradian communism with the local area. The Red Star waves over our capital, a testament to those who have fallen for our freedom. The Feathisian worker has won the future and we will not be easily swayed to abandon our ways."
FEA_education_reform_communist_idea_1:0 "Education Reform"
FEA_education_reform_communist_idea_1_desc:0 "The new Feathisian education system has been repurposed to follow practical skills instead of bourgeoisie hobbies. All Griffons will learn about machinery and planning for the good of society. Who needs artists anyway?"
FEA_communist_army_idea_2:0 "An Army of Militias"
FEA_communist_army_idea_2_desc:0 "Every Union has its own militia. This way the workers own not only the means of production, but also the means to defend themselves from any sort of oppression. They train in the evening after work and are highly motivated to defend our new state. The fact that every unit insists on voting on any manoeuver before following an order might make commanding this army a hard task, however."
FEA_education_reform_communist_idea_2:0 "Education Reform"
FEA_education_reform_communist_idea_2_desc:0 "The old education system has been swept away by the revolution and in its place we have created an education on the virtues of socialism. This will surely help increase the population's willingness to defend the revolution!"
FEA_industrialisation_plan:0 "Nationale Industrialisatie-Inspanning"
FEA_industrialisation_plan_desc:0 "The National Industrialisation Effort has been chosen to radically and forcefully increase our production capacities. The Feathisian State must be well armed and well prepared if we are to face the challenges of the future. All citizens will be required to do their part, or else."
FEA_secret_police_idea:0 "Staatspolitie"
FEA_secret_police_idea_desc:0 "The Secret State Police monitors our citizenry for any counter-revolutionary behaviour.  Of course all loyal Feathisians have nothing to fear and will be recruited to help the Staatspolitie network themselves. Secret policegriffons have also been embedded into our army units and we have made the soldiers aware of this to increase their loyalty."
FEA_strasserite_army:0 "De Heerschaar"
FEA_strasserite_army_desc:0 "The new Feathisian Heerschaar, an old world for army, will spread the revolution far and wide. The national-revolutionary spirit runs within the veins of the military and their efforts embolden us. Soon Feathisia's revolution will live in glory the world over!"
FEA_the_new_heartland_ideas:0 "The New Age"
FEA_the_new_heartland_ideas_desc:0 "A new age has dawned for our country. All Griffons have joined in the Rozenkamp brothers' efforts to support the uniquely Feathisian National-Revolution. Our Heerschaar marches proudly through the streets, cheered on by the workers, who labour to construct the New Age! The capitalists have found themselves a new mortal enemy in Feathisia and we will root out and exterminate their heinous system."
FEA_ruined_economy_1:0 "Ruined Economy"
FEA_ruined_economy_1_desc:0 "In spite of efforts to fix it, the brief and bloody Feathisian Civil War has managed to utterly destroy our economy"

FEA_militarized_society_idea:0 "Feathisian Militarism"
FEA_militarized_society_idea_desc:0 "After the brutal civil war, it was clear that only the military could protect the citizens of Feathisia. Now under the iron claw of the Baron, the Feathisian military has become the cornerstone of government and society. Most citizens are in some way involved with the army, which provides discipline and purpose to the nation. Feathisia is not a nation run by the military, its nation is the military."
FEA_partisan_warfare_idea:0 "Partizanenoorlog"
FEA_partisan_warfare_idea_desc:0 "Not all Griffons serve in the army, but all who have other functions do train to use firearms. They play a supporting role in any conflict, assisting our brave soldiers in their tasks. Our partisans will make life terrifying for any invading army."
FEA_black_spot:0 "The Black Spot of Griffonia"
FEA_black_spot_desc:0 "Feathisia has been completely sealed of from the outside world. Our soldiers protect from any outside threat, so that we may live in safety. We will make sure that no foreign invaders ever get into the country and that none of our loyal citizens will ever wish to leave."
FEA_gestapo:0 "Geheime Staatspolitie"
FEA_gestapo_desc:0 "The Secret State Police is our new secret police service, directly under control of Heeren himself. The secret agents will infiltrate any resistance groups and root them out mercilessly. Feathisia will not tolerate any traitors to live. The G-S will make sure that all citizens who hide any undesirables will also receive a fitting punishment."
FEA_bronze_sentinels:0 "Bronzen Schildwachten"
FEA_bronze_sentinels_desc:0 "The Bronze Sentinels have always supported our leadership. Now that Heeren is finally in power, the Sentinels form their own organisation next to the regular army. Although the regular army units mistrust the Griffons in brown, they are highly motivated and will fight for Heeren and Feathisia until their last breath. They may have some odd rituals, but their dedication is unwavering."
FEA_liberty_through_work_ideas:0 "Freedom through Servitude"
FEA_liberty_through_work_ideas_desc:0 "Those undesirables who constantly undermine the state will be interned into labour camps. These facilities might be costly, but a regimen of gruelling unforgiving labour and a chronic shortage of food will help the prisoners to become pure. It might be better if we make sure the general public does not know the details about these detention centres, however."
FEA_corporate_allies_2_idea:0 "Corporate Allies"
FEA_corporate_allies_2_idea_desc:0 "Our public works projects and our preparation for war surely have made us some friends in the upper class. Our guarantees to keep their conglomerates together, along with big government contracts, will help us secure the loyalty of the Griffons at the top of the food chain."
FEA_death_squads_idea:0 "Doodseskader"
FEA_death_squads_idea_desc:0 "The best of our Sentinels have joined the death squads. They understand the importance of our cause and are willing to lay down their lives to protect it from internal and external threats. The Sentinels will welcome death like an old friend. They will not try to hide from death, or fight it. For death does not frighten them in the slightest."
FEA_commie_ressistance:0 "The Red Front"
FEA_commie_ressistance_desc:0 "Comprised of former PvdA members, Rozenkamp's clique and Orthodox Communists, the Red Front has taken to occupying our factories and harassing the workers as a form of resistance against the Duke's government.

FEA_democratic_ressistance:0 "The Feathisian Liberation Front"
FEA_democratic_ressistance_desc:0 "Formed primarily of LDP members and liberal leaning members of the FHP, the Feathisian Liberation Front has taken to agitating the populace in an effort to restore parliamentary rule. Many of the Duke's oldest friends and advisors, along with politicians, journalists and academics, comprise the Front's leadership. Although their means are mostly peaceful, they have sworn to fight on until democracy rules Feathisia once more."
FEA_fascist_ressistance:0 "The Fatherland Front"
FEA_fascist_ressistance_desc:0 "Comprising of the FNV and traitors within the military, the Fatherland Front has taken to using their paramilitaries to fight the government in the streets. Deserting soldiers, Bronze Sentinels and others all fight the Duke's loyalists. The streets are unsafe and the army is barely under our control while this situation persists."
FEA_dukes_country_idea:0 "The Duke's Country"
FEA_dukes_country_ided_desc:0 "Feathisia is run by one single Griffon now, Grand Duke Gerlach. The duke used to be a gentle and calm figure, who saw compromise and debate as the best way to rule. When the country collapsed due to indecisiveness and an attempt on his life was made, something changed. Now the duke sees traitors everywhere, his friends betrayed him. His people were betrayed by extremists and democrats alike. Now he rules with an iron claw, taking on an ungodly amount of work himself to make sure everything goes exactly as he wants it to."
FEA_the_dukes_army_idea:0 "The Duke's Army"
FEA_the_dukes_army_idea_desc:0 "The Duke has assumed personal command over the armed forces. All plans and manoeuvers go through him first. That way no traitor can meddle with the military anymore and no mistakes will be made ever again. As the people love their ruler, they have flocked to the heraldic standard of Weijermars to strengthen the Duke's Army."
FEA_secret_service:0 "DGDvdH"
FEA_secret_service_desc:0 "De Geheime Dienst van de Hertog, the Duke's secret service, is under orders of our most loyal citizens. To protect the citizens of Feathisia from any sort of harm, the secret service makes sure no traitors or treacherous ideas will ever taint the minds of his Griffons ever again. This way there will never be another time of instability.\n\nFree speech and privacy are not necessary, the Duke will make sure all correct ideas are implemented anyway. And most importantly, the service will ensure no soul will ever betray the Duke again."
FEA_new_officer_core_idea:0 "New Officer Corps"
FEA_new_officer_core_idea_desc:0 "Many of the old officers decided to join the Fatherland Front when parliament was finally disbanded. This only played into our claw in the end, as we now have new loyal officers, who don't have a misplaced loyalty to the nation over loyalty to the Duke, Feathisia's protector and guide."
FEA_banker_friends:0 "Friends in the Banks"
FEA_banker_friends_desc:0 "Our friends in the Banks only help us more now that we have ensured that all instability is gone. Feathisia will always be a safe investment now that the meddlesome political parties have been dealt with. This has attracted the funds of many bankers both domestic and foreign."
FEA_industrial_council_idea:0 "DIRvdH"
FEA_industrial_council_idea_desc:0 "De Industriële Raad van de Hertog, the Duke's industrial council, will preside over the economy. They will make sure everything is meticulously planned and that the citizens of Feathisia will not lack any goods. Now that the PvdA and their unproductive labour laws have been cleared away, the economy can finally preform at its best."
FEA_dukes_country_idea_2:0 "The Duke's Country"
FEA_dukes_country_idea_2_desc:0 "Feathisia is run by one single Griffon now, Grand Duke Gerlach. The once calm nobleman is completely unrecognisable from his old self. Now the duke sees traitors everywhere, his friends betrayed him in his darkest hour. His people were betrayed by extremists and democrats alike. Now he rules with an iron claw and he is ready to lead his country to victory by all who could ever pose a threat to it, so that nothing ever goes wrong again."
FEA_economic_calibration:0 "Economic Recalibration"
FEA_economic_calibration_desc:0 "Duke Gerlach has taken over control of the economy. His inspectors and managers are making sure everything is running the best it can. This will ensure the economic crisis caused by previous indecision will soon vanish."
FEA_d_labour_battalion_ideas:0 "Werkbrigades"
FEA_d_labour_battalion_ideas_desc:0 "Some Griffons are unwise in their choice of labour. We have made labour brigades to conscript these Griffons and to guide them down a useful and honest employment. If all citizens work hard, Feathisia will be the best country it can be."
FEA_privy_council_idea:0 "The Council of State"
FEA_privy_council_idea_desc:0 "The Council of State is an ancient entity which advises the Grand Duke on all sorts of matters. The members of the Council are amongst the Duke's closest advisors.

FEA_a_new_centrist_army_idea_desc:0 "The various militias, knights and professional soldiers that used to comprise the Feathisian Armed Forces have been reorganised into the Grand Army by Edgar Pechvogel.

FEA_centrist_agraranism_idea:0 "Agrarisme"
FEA_centrist_agraranism_idea_desc:0 "We have embraced the philosophy of agrarianism. The Griffons who work the earth are as important as the ones who labour in the factories.

FEA_centrist_unions_idea:0 "Poldermodel"
FEA_centrist_unions_idea_desc:0 "A model of compromise named after the Feathisian word for Artificial Land, pragmatism and compromise have again taken centre stage in Feathisian politics now that the country is under siege."

FEA_centrist_labour_squads_idea_desc:0 "Unemployed Griffons have been assigned to the Workers battalions. These groups will be used to quickly complete certain projects assigned to them by the National Salvation Council.

FEA_increase_taxes:0 "Increase Taxes"
FEA_increase_taxes_desc:0 "To make sure we can handle the expenses of the buyouts, we must increase taxes on our already suffering citizens. This will decrease the living standards of the average griffon, but it is necessary to swiftly end the crisis."
FEA_spending_cuts:0 "Cut Spending"
FEA_spending_cuts_desc:0 "There are many expenditures that aren't necessary to save the economy. We can cut back on arts and environmental funding for example. Although many griffons consider these subsidies very important and worthwhile, we simply cannot afford them with our current policies."
FEA_buyout_noble_assets:0 "Buyout Noble Estates"
FEA_buyout_noble_assets_desc:0 "Some of the Noble families had massive investments abroad and in trading companies. With the collapse of foreign trade, many of these families are in trouble.

FEA_nationalize_railroads:0 "Railway Nationalisation"
FEA_nationalize_railroads_desc:0 "The Railways have been privatised not that long ago in an effort to cut government spending by allowing competition. However, the train companies are barely staying afloat. We must nationalise the railroads to make sure our citizens can still get to work!"

FEA_buyout_failing_farms_desc:0 "Many of the smaller, privately owned farms are suffering from the crisis. A breakdown in food export and reduced domestic consumption have forced us to act. We will nationalise the farms in trouble to safeguard our food supply in the future."
FEA_nationalize_industries:0 "Industrial Nationalisation"
FEA_nationalize_industries_desc:0 "We must protect the jobs of griffons working in the factories that are hit by the crisis. We will buy out the failing industrial companies. This will cost us a lot of funds, but will put these factories at the disposal of the Duchy."
FEA_finish_intervention:0 "Finish the Intervention"
FEA_finish_intervention_desc:0 "Our decisive action cost us a lot of money we didn't really have, but it is showing results. The intervention is finished now, and the state-owned companies are starting to be able to stand on their own claws again."

FEA_the_industrial_gamble_desc:0 "We will approach the governments of some foreign nations. We will allow their companies generous tax breaks if they invest in us.

FEA_big_business_rupport:0 "Support Big Businesses"
FEA_big_business_rupport_desc:0 "Our largest companies give many griffons jobs and security. We must give them a good tax deal, to ensure that they stay with us and expand their operations in Feathisia."

FEA_PvdA_policy:0 "PvdA Economic Policy"
FEA_PvdA_policy_desc:0 "The recent economic depression has been exceptional hard upon working class individuals, leading to the election of the PvdA. This party will attempt to combat our current economic hardships by investing in public works projects, socialising health care, strengthening labour rights, and nationalising resources critical to our duchy's security."
FEA_unionism:0 "Unionism"
FEA_unionism_desc:0 "Protection of unions has never been a high priority within our duchy. However, the PvdA calls for new legislation which will enshrine the rights of unions to form, recruit, and strike. This will go a long way in allowing our citizens to unify and fight for their rights."
FEA_workers_rights:0 "The Arbeidswetten"
FEA_workers_rights_desc:0 "Arbeidswetten, or labour laws, will go a long way in protecting the lives and happiness of our citizens. By enshrining and codifying a concrete set of laws into our legal framework, it will allow us to hold our corporations accountable for malpractices levelled at their labour force."
FEA_the_great_experiment:0 "State Owned Armouries"
FEA_the_great_experiment_desc:0 "Previously, the supplying of our armed forces was handled via contract work. While this was a very effective system in the previous eras of warfare, the complicated nature of modern war, and diversity of equipment needed, means that central planning could go a long way in streamlining the process."
FEA_railroad_project:0 "Massive Railway Projects"
FEA_railroad_project_desc:0 "Our duchy is poorly connected outside of the area immediately surrounding De Vleguels. This severely hampers economic growth and denies us access to a wealth of resources too hard to transport. In response, the PvdA has called for the construction of a massive rail network which will connect our resource rich regions to the industrial heartland."
FEA_free_healthcare:0 "The Algemeen Ziekenfonds"
FEA_free_healthcare_desc:0 "The Algemeen Ziekenfonds, or health insurance fund, is a state run organisation which provides a basic level of health insurance to the poorer members of Feathisian society.

FEA_public_works_projects:0 "The Arbeidsplan"
FEA_public_works_projects_desc:0 "The Arbeidsplan, of Employment Plan, is a policy put forth by the PvdA which calls for guaranteed employment throughout our population. No longer will those who wish to work be denied the right. This plan works through a combination of public works projects, grants to firms who create positions, and subsidies to labour intensive corporations who operate within our duchy."
FEA_socialist_education:0 "Socialist Education"
FEA_socialist_education_desc:0 "Education is by far the most important investment a nation can make. A well-educated population is a productive population. However, for ages, our people have struggled with a system that propagates illiteracy and hinders our ability to grow economically, scientifically, and culturally."
FEA_LDP_policy:0 "LDP Economic Policy"
FEA_LDP_policy_desc:0 "The recent economic depression has hit the entirety of Feathisian society hard. However, the people of Feathisia have not fallen to extremists views on how to resolve these hardships. Rather, they have turned to the LDP. The LDP's economic policy calls for further funding to public works projects and redrafting a trade legislation."
FEA_industrial_investements:0 "Invest in Industrialisation"
FEA_industrial_investements_desc:0 "The majority of economic activity within our duchy is agricultural in nature. This is not how a modern state should operate. To address this, the LDP has released a very generous budget which will funnel a significant amount of money into subsidies and loans for firms looking to develop industrial projects within our duchy."
FEA_welfare_for_the_citizens:0 "Sociaal-Economische Raad Program"
FEA_welfare_for_the_citizens_desc:0 "The Sociaal-Economische Raad, or Socio-Economic Council, is a new committee created by the LDP. Their duty is to remedy conflicts between unions and employers. They will do this by making compromises instead of striking for the good of society."
FEA_massive_infrastructure_projeects:0 "Massive Infrastructure Projects"
FEA_massive_infrastructure_projeects_desc:0 "There are many within our duchy who have yet to find stable income since our economic depression. This means there's still great need for further public works projects. Thankfully, our duchy still needs additional infrastructure."
FEA_trade_relations:0 "Open For Business"
FEA_trade_relations_desc:0 "Our current trade legislation hinders our ability to attract investment, being burdened by protectionist principles and excessive duty taxes. If we wish to attract foreign investment then this legislation must be reformed into something with greater benefits for foreign money."
FEA_attract_investors:0 "Attract Investors"
FEA_attract_investors_desc:0 "With our legislation now reformed, it's time to offer foreign investors an incentive to set up shop in our lands. One idea put forth, is to establish special economic zones. These will offer investors a site where labour, tax, and business laws are as relaxed and pro-business as possible."
FEA_dockyards:0 "Expand the Rottendedam Dockyards"
FEA_dockyards_desc:0 "Previously, our goods heading abroad travelled through Skyfall. However, recent events have proven that relying upon another nation for our export of goods can be a risky proposition. Thankfully, Feathisia has its own connection to the sea in the form of the port city of Rottendedam."
FEA_education_grants:0 "Education Grants"
FEA_education_grants_desc:0 "Previously, universities were denied to all but the wealthiest of individuals. However, this denies us access to a large pool of potential skills. To address this, our government has created a program to offer generous grants to gifted students of a less privileged background."
FEA_FHP_policy:0 "FHP Economic Policy"
FEA_FHP_policy_desc:0 "Our economic crisis has been hard upon the entire population of Feathisia, with our landed elite bearing the brunt of this storm. Their estates, which were once the economic engine of our duchy, have been driven to the brink of bankruptcy. In order to resolve this, the FHP has called for these estates to be bailed out and our trade policy to be reformed to help facilitate agricultural export."
FEA_agrarianism:0 "Agrarisme"
FEA_agrarianism_desc:0 "Agricultural has always been a vital part of our economic health, dating back to when our main export was tulips. Our agricultural productivity is handled mainly by large estates managed by our landed elite. Many of these estates were put into bankruptcy during the last economic crisis. Now, many of these lands remain fallow. It is imperative that we bail our these estates and get them back in production."
FEA_minor_industrial_projects:0 "Minor Industrial Projects"
FEA_minor_industrial_projects_desc:0 "A growing portion of our population has migrated towards our cities over the past few decades. These regions were hit hard during the economic crisis, as demand for consumer goods collapsed. This left many out of work and homeless. It is important that we subsidies ventures which would re-open these factories and provide much needed employment."
FEA_modern_methods:0 "Modern Industrial Methods"
FEA_modern_methods_desc:0 "The Griffon continent has always lagged behind that of Equestria in terms of industrial and electronic innovations. This has left our industries at a disadvantage in terms of cost and production. In order to address this, our government has established a program to license Equestrian patents and hire foreign experts in order to bridge this technological gap."
FEA_FNV_policy:0 "FNV Economic Policy"
FEA_FNV_policy_desc:0 "Our economic crisis has been hard upon the Griffons of Feathisia, wiping out the savings and livelihoods of our citizens. However, there are leaches upon our economy who have thrived under this chaos. Our economic policy is plain and simple. We must remove these leaches from our economy and return the wealth of our duchy to the hardworking Griffons who populate it."
FEA_nationalization_act:0 "Industrial Nationalisation Act"
FEA_nationalization_act_desc:0 "At the height of our economic crisis, a number of factories went into bankruptcy, leaving thousands unemployed and homeless. These factories have remained in fallow, merely collecting dust. While they are still technically owed by the capitalists and landed elite, their ownership is void due to their misuse of such assets."
FEA_labour_battalions:0 "The Arbeidersbataljons"
FEA_labour_battalions_desc:0 "Many of our citizens have been left unemployed by the current economic crisis. To remedy this, the FNV has called for the assembly of Arbeidersbataljons, or workers battalions. These units will perform vital construction work, while providing income to thousands in desperate need of it."
FEA_state_unions:0 "Establish the Staatsvakbond"
FEA_state_unions_desc:0 "Prior to the FNV coming to power, Feathisia's unions were numerous, covering a wide range of professions and politics. This created a system where so-called 'unions' were actually run by politically motivated individuals who pilfered from their employees. To fix this corrupt system, the FNV has called for the consolidation of all unions into a single, politically neutral, Staatsvakbond, or state union."
FEA_subsides_farmers:0 "The Farmer-Fonds Program"
FEA_subsides_farmers_desc:0 "The Farmer-Fonds Program calls for the establishment of a state bank which will provide low-interest loans to our farmers, helping them acquire the assets needed to grow and modernise their estates. The main objective of this program is to help our smaller landholders compete with the massive estates held by the landed elite."
FEA_autobahn:0 "The Autobaan"
FEA_autobahn_desc:0 "The Autobaan is a series of highways which will connect the major settlements of our land. When completed, the transport of goods and Griffons will be quicker, cheaper, and safer then ever before."
FEA_resource_nationalisation:0 "Steel Industry Nationalisation"
FEA_resource_nationalisation_desc:0 "Most steel mills within our duchy are owned by a small cartel of corporations, many of which are foreign in nature. This has created a situation where the money produced by our workers and resources is going into the pockets of leaches from outside our country. In order to stop this, the FNV has called for the nationalisation of all steel mills with their profits returning to Feathisia."
FEA_education_reforms:0 "Support the Rottendedam University"
FEA_education_reforms_desc:0 "The Rottendedam University is the pride of Feathisian education, providing thousands of students with an excellent education. However, in recent years this institution has fallen on hard times, with both enrolment and donations dropping. The FNV wants to see this monument to Griffon education properly financed and given the assets required to turn it into a world class facility."

FEA_army_stuff:0 "The Feathisian Army"
FEA_army_stuff_desc:0 "The Feathisian Army is one of the best armies in Griffonian history, even if those we fought against underestimated ourselves as only traders and sailors throughout history. Even our pristine army, however, can make use of reforms to propel us into the modern age of warfare."
FEA_mobile_1:0 "Mobiele-Oorlogsvoering Doctrine"
FEA_mobile_1_desc:0 "More radical, daring officers have been experimenting with a doctrine focused around movement and armour.  Combining these two, we will overwhelm our enemy with the speed at which we can reposition."
FEA_mobile_2:0 "Motorised Units"
FEA_mobile_2_desc:0 "Using trucks as transport is an idea that is not unknown, it's what they were made for after all. Having dedicated vehicles for some of our divisions, which they can use in manoeuvers, will help us to quickly secure the ground the pantsers will conquer. To make sure these units are effective, however, we will need to also develop modern small-arms."
FEA_mobile_3:0 "Invest Into Entrop Manufacturing"
FEA_mobile_3_desc:0 "Entrop Manufacturing is one of Feathisia's premier manufacturing plants, and was one of the first manufacturers of automobiles in Feathisia. Encouraging them to open up more factories and to cheapen their production process - in exchange for giving them first pick on contracts - is a mutually beneficial arrangement."
FEA_mobile_4:0 "Light Pantser Models"
FEA_mobile_4_desc:0 "The Pantser, or tank, is the perfect fit for our mobile doctrine. It combines speed and firepower for a quick victory. If we are to win the war of movement, developing pantsers will be key."
FEA_mobile_5:0 "Medium Pantser Models"
FEA_mobile_5_desc:0 "Heavier armoured than the light tank and still fairly easy to produce, the medium pantser is the logical next step in armour development. This versatile machine, if led by competent commanders, could turn out to be the king of the modern battlefield."
FEA_mobile_6:0 "Perfect the Mobiele-Oorlogsvoering Doctrine"
FEA_mobile_6_desc:0 "With our doctrine solidified and our officers trained, it's time to enhance it with further study and trials. We have promoted the most daring and brazen officers to lead the charge. Initiative and aggressiveness will be the watchwords of our armoured corps!"
FEA_superior_1:0 "Overweldigende Vuurkracht Doctrine"
FEA_superior_1_desc:0 "Some have argued that warfare is not a difficult field of study. It is merely logistics and numbers. If you outgun the enemy and most efficiently pack firepower in a small area, you are sure to win. Let us embrace the doctrine of Overwhelming Firepower."
FEA_superior_2:0 "Modern Infantry Equipment"
FEA_superior_2_desc:0 "The first step to fire superiority lies in designing new guns, both big and small. Mortars, machine guns, howitzers and cannons are all needed if we are to outshoot the enemy, rather than outman them. Several designs have been drawn up to get our arsenal up to modern standards."
FEA_superior_3:0 "Establish the Artillerie-Werken"
FEA_superior_3_desc:0 "To build all the new artillery we need, Feathisia must establish a new factory. We have chosen a suitable site in Luxwingburg for a dedicated artillery factory. The Artillerie-Werken will pump out the guns and the shells we need to blast a way through any foe."
FEA_superior_4:0 "Establish the Commandotroepen"
FEA_superior_4_desc:0 "Special Forces are the masters of gaining local fire superiority. Equipped with rapid-fire weapons, the Feathisian commandos will be our trailblazer, our most tenacious defenders and most loyal soldiers. We may not have the largest army, but Feathisia might just have the best commando troops."
FEA_superior_5:0 "Experimental Weaponry"
FEA_superior_5_desc:0 "Regular weapons are only part of the playing field, especially in Equestria. Although Feathisia lacks the crystals to easily manufacture magical weapons, it will still be a worthwhile investment to research them. Magical weapons provide an added punch which will only help our Firepower doctrine."
FEA_superior_6:0 "Perfect the Overweldigende Vuurkracht Doctrine"
FEA_superior_6_desc:0 "Even though our doctrine is quite straightforward, it is hard to perfect. Many logistical operations to get ammunition at the right place and quickly building and deconstructing artillery emplacements are but two of the challenges we face if we are to master the art of destruction."
FEA_grand_1:0 "Groot Strijdplan Doctrine"
FEA_grand_1_desc:0 "The more senior thinkers amongst the army have theorised that our country would benefit most from a defensive posture. By encompassing our country and all our forces in one grand battle plan, we will be able to predict any enemy assault and take effective countermeasures."
FEA_grand_2:0 "Guns for the Troops"
FEA_grand_2_desc:0 "We have identified a lack of modern firearms amongst our soldiers, some have to even use wooden replicas during training. We have received an opportunity to purchase some rifles from abroad, but the general staff has demanded that we also design a new domestic rifle, to save both the dignity and combat effectiveness of the armed forces."
FEA_grand_3:0 "Modern Artillery"
FEA_grand_3_desc:0 "When Grover conquered most of the continent, he did so with a grand battery of artillery. Nothing much has changed since then and Boreas is still on the side with the best artillery. Our general staff, understandably, has urged the cabinet to make sure we have the best artillery."
FEA_grand_4:0 "Dedicated Support Squads"
FEA_grand_4_desc:0 "To improve the combat effectiveness of our divisions, we need to include dedicated support squads. These will make entrenchments or scout for the main force. Having specialised troops for this purpose will help our army to overcome even the most difficult terrain one may encounter in Griffonia."
FEA_grand_5:0 "Specialised Staff"
FEA_grand_5_desc:0 "Our officers and staff members need to be trained to support their superiors in planning and preparing our battles. A general does not work on his own and the entire staff is a team, from the aide de camp to the communications officer."
FEA_grand_6:0 "Perfect the Groot Strijdplan Doctrine"
FEA_grand_6_desc:0 "Our most patient, calm officers have been promoted to be in line with our doctrine. Our troops have been instructed on defensive tactics and our army is prepared for the coming conflict. All that is left is to drill, drill, drill!"
FEA_mass_1:0 "Massa-Aanval Doctrine"
FEA_mass_1_desc:0 "The ugly truth is that with our current conscription and admission laws, the Feathisian army is dangerously small. Our professional troops may not like this, but a rapid increase in the size of the armed forces might be the only way that Feathisia can stay alive."
FEA_mass_2:0 "Guns For Days"
FEA_mass_2_desc:0 "It is imperative that we get a rifle for all our new soldiers. Museums or other countries. It doesn't matter where we find them, as long as we equip our troops. If we have some money left after all these purchases, then maybe we can also put some thought into upgrading our small arms."
FEA_mass_3:0 "Lots of Cannons"
FEA_mass_3_desc:0 "Simply put, our army will need lots of cannons. To protect our common soldiers at least a little bit, we need to be able to field more artillery than the opponent. Luckily we have found a discount offer on the global market to get some decent howitzers on the cheap."
FEA_mass_4:0 "A Shovel For Every Soldier"
FEA_mass_4_desc:0 "All that griffonpower is going to waste if our soldiers are not fighting. If we give our soldiers more shovels, they can at least dig some trenches while they aren't charging the enemy."
FEA_mass_5:0 "Streamlined Production"
FEA_mass_5_desc:0 "The Feathisian army can easily do more with less. Testing and safety procedures for firearms are all well and good in peacetime, but we need to ramp up our production now. By cutting red tape and unnecessary fancy parts of our production process, we effectively gain more factories."
FEA_mass_6:0 "Perfect the Massa-Aanval Doctrine"
FEA_mass_6_desc:0 "Our officers are finally getting used to the increased workload of commanding all these new soldiers. The Feathisian army may not be the most elite, prestigious fighting force it once was, but at least our front line is filled with hardy griffons who are willing to give their all for the fatherland."
FEA_military_science:0 "Military Science"
FEA_military_science_desc:0 "Our army has been pushed out of the last millennium by some thorough reforms. Military theorists and thinkers have been swept up in the excitement of change. We finally have enough daring thinkers so that military research can help our nation forward as much as the civilian universities."
FEA_racial_theory:0 "Hidden Potential"
FEA_racial_theory_desc:0 "Worldwide, griffons aren't known for their magic, but that does not mean we don't have it. Our abilities may not be as flashy as those of unicorns, but our knights and enchanters can definitely be a great help, even in the modern age. We should apply funding to research more practical applications for our hidden potentials."
FEA_magical_weapons:0 "Magical Weaponry Experiments"
FEA_magical_weapons_desc:0 "Lately, more and more nations have switched to magic weapons. We should experiment with the crystal-fuelled rifles as well. If we are able to outfit some of our units with those guns, our army will be even deadlier."
FEA_code_language:0 "Develop a Code Language"
FEA_code_language_desc:0 "Although the nobles in Griffenheim joke that Feathisian is already incomprehensible, we still need to make an actual code language to protect our military secrets from any espionage. It will be quite the task to make sure all officers know its codes and protocols without revealing that information to any prying eyes.    "
FEA_radar_project:0 "RADAR Experiments"
FEA_radar_project_desc:0 "The RADAR helps detect foes, especially aircraft, from afar. Using radio waves, these emplacements can help increase our battlefield control. A few of those towers in the correct places could make Feathisian airspace that much safer."

FEA_navy_stuff:0 "Re-Open the Vlootacademie"
FEA_navy_stuff_desc:0 "The Fleet Academy was once the pride of Feathisia and if we are to sail the seas once more, we will have to re-open the academy and train a new generation of naval officers. These new cadets will ensure that Feathisia is a name to be feared on the oceans!"
FEA_being_1:0 "A Surface Fleet"
FEA_being_1_desc:0 "To properly project our power across the seas and into territories of vital interest, we have to build a prestigious and seaworthy surface fleet. We will show the world that Feathisian ships are still the finest that sail the ocean!"
FEA_being_2:0 "Advanced Battleship Models"
FEA_being_2_desc:0 "Although modern ships are built out of steel instead of wood nowadays, the basic principle remains the same. More, higher calibre cannons on resilient and robust ships will win the day. We must challenge our designers to build more modern and more heavily armed battleships."
FEA_being_3:0 "Expand the Rottendedam Naval Base"
FEA_being_3_desc:0 "Rottendedam's port is great for trading, but simply not large enough to house our expanding fleet. We must expand the ports and the dockyards so that even the most modern vessels can be constructed there. One day, we shall out-build even Skyfall itself!"
FEA_being_4:0 "Destroyer Effort"
FEA_being_4_desc:0 "Battleships can simply not be made in large enough numbers to protect all our trade routes. Besides, even when we can bring them to bear upon the enemy, smaller screen ships will help to protect the big ships against attacks from submarines. We are certain a big push can bring our destroyers up to modern standards."
FEA_being_5:0 "Cruiser Effort"
FEA_being_5_desc:0 "To complete our surface fleet, we will need Cruisers, a class in between battleships and screens. We can choose to invest in light cruisers, which can operate as more long range screens, or heavy cruisers, which are almost capital-ship level. The admiralty has yet to make a final decision."
FEA_being_6:0 "De Grote Vloot"
FEA_being_6_desc:0 "Now that the designs have been made and the first prototypes are slipping from the dockyards, we will make our dream a reality. The pride of our sailors and the design of our ships are unmatched in Griffonia. The Grand Fleet of Feathisia will set sail!"
FEA_strike_1:0 "Naval Aviation"
FEA_strike_1_desc:0 "Modern times have brought us the aircraft. We can focus our fleet on ships that house these craft and destroy the enemy from a range farther than the biggest gun can reach. If our fleet is to be the strongest, we will have to build it around these aircraft carriers."
FEA_strike_2:0 "Destroyer Fleet"
FEA_strike_2_desc:0 "Our carriers are hard to manoeuver and carry few armaments. In the event of an enemy fleet getting close, we will need to have screen ships to keep them at bay. Destroyers are relatively easy to build and an excellent choice for this role.  "
FEA_strike_3:0 "O-Boat Experiments"
FEA_strike_3_desc:0 "The submarine was a Feathisian invention that was mostly used for novelty and leisure. However, many nations have seen the potential of arming such ships to sneak up on trade convoys and even military ships. We mustn't lag behind and make sure our O-boat models are as effective as theirs."
FEA_strike_4:0 "Improved Carrier Models"
FEA_strike_4_desc:0 "The Aircraft Carrier will be the centre of our fleet. Therefore, we must invest all our efforts in having our design be revolutionary. It costs a lot of funds and time to make one of these ships, so we have to ensure we get it right, or risk scuppering the entire project."
FEA_strike_5:0 "Rottendedam Airbase"
FEA_strike_5_desc:0 "To train all our carrier pilots and to house ground based aircraft to support our fleet in coastal operations, Rottendedam Airbase has to be expanded. New runways and hangars will have to be constructed and ground personnel will have to be attracted. With this project, we will safeguard the aerial capacity of both our fleet and our normal air force."
FEA_strike_6:0 "Marine Luchtvaart"
FEA_strike_6_desc:0 "We have completed our fleet plans based around naval aviation. With our aircraft carriers, the Feathisian navy will be a force to be reckoned with once more. What is left is to give our pilots special naval aviation training, so that they will be one cut above the rest."
FEA_further_expansion:0 "Expand the Rottendedam Dockyards"
FEA_further_expansion_desc:0 "The doctrines have been written and the manuals distributed. The ship designs drawn up and the sailors mustered. All that is left is to actually build the ships of our navy. We will expand the Rottendedam harbour by recovering new land from the sea, so that there will be room for more dockyards."
FEA_transport:0 "Experimental Landing Craft"
FEA_transport_desc:0 "Now that our fleet is up to shape, we can start thinking one step further. Once we have wrestled control of the sea from our enemies, we will need to take over their naval bases as well. For this new assault craft will have to be made."
FEA_marines:0 "Form the FMC"
FEA_marines_desc:0 "Especially hardy griffons will be able to enlist in a new part of the armed forces, the Fetisische Marine Corps. This unit will be based under our fleet and fight the toughest battles, both to cross rivers and to attack from the sea. 'As far as the world goes!'"

FEA_air_stuff:0 "Construct New Airbases"
FEA_air_stuff_desc:0 "It has come to our attention that griffon knights are no longer the most dangerous creatures in the skies. Airplanes outfitted with bombs and machine guns are a new threat on the modern battlefields. Before we ourselves can even dream of building a modern air force like that, Feathisia will need to build new airfields to train and house our pilots and planes."
FEA_air_superior_1:0 "Air Superiority Doctrine"
FEA_air_superior_1_desc:0 "To protect our homes from bombers and to safeguard our troops on the battlefield, we must make sure we have air superiority. If the air force can keep the skies clean of enemies, our army will surely be able to win the fight. Therefore, we shall instruct our theorists to develop fighter tactics."
FEA_air_superior_2:0 "Beakker D.XXI"
FEA_air_superior_2_desc:0 "Beakker, a Feathisian company that has been producing planes for many Griffonian states, has proposed several fighter models for the modern age. Chief among these is the D.XXI, with a top speed of 460 kilometres per hour. Carrying 4 machine guns, this fighter could well become the mainstay of our fledgling air force."
FEA_air_superior_3:0 "Beakker G.I"
FEA_air_superior_3_desc:0 "Another plan from Beakker is the G.I or the 'Jachtkruiser'. This massive fighter aircraft with heavy armaments is aptly named after cruiser ships. It will easily destroy flimsy lighter fighters. We only have to purchase the design, custom made for the Feathisian Airforce."
FEA_air_superior_4:0 "Beakker C.X"
FEA_air_superior_4_desc:0 "The Beakker C.X is a light, nimble craft, ideally suited for battlefield support tactics. Beakker initially made is as a recon craft for hard to reach areas as jungles. Although the planes are lightly armed, they pack a punch of nasty bombs to destroy armour."
FEA_air_superior_5:0 "Expand the Airbases"
FEA_air_superior_5_desc:0 "Most of our hangars were made for larger passenger planes. We simply need more airstrips and hangars to house the amount of fighters we are planning to construct. Several plots of land need to be given a new Land-Use plan to accommodate our growing airfields."
FEA_air_superior_6:0 "Vliegende Luipaarden"
FEA_air_superior_6_desc:0 "The best squadron of our air force is called the Flying Leopards. Our relations department has suggested we market this name to the younger generation, to get them interested in military aviation. Telling of the heroism of our best pilots should give the rest the aspiration to push their limits as well."
FEA_air_bombing_1:0 "Strategic Destruction Doctrine"
FEA_air_bombing_1_desc:0 "We simply must neutralise the enemy's production capabilities. Large, robust planes can reach deep behind the frontline and hit our foes at home. By planning for a campaign of strategic destruction, we will starve the enemy of the resources they require to wage war on us."
FEA_air_bombing_2:0 "Gerlach 139"
FEA_air_bombing_2_desc:0 "The 139 model, named after the Archduke, was supposed to be a passenger liner at first. However, when Beakker heard of our attempts to procure bomber aircraft, they quickly redesigned it into a long range bomber craft. We just need to convince the duke that it's okay to have his name on a plane."
FEA_air_bombing_3:0 "Beakker T.IX"
FEA_air_bombing_3_desc:0 "Beakker has developed a smaller bomber model for medium range missions. The model is apparently quite versatile and can accomplish both close air support and strategic missions. The first test flight of the prototype was impressive, with the craft almost running silent due to special regulator screws. We should get our hands on the design!"
FEA_air_bombing_4:0 "Beakker D.XC"
FEA_air_bombing_4_desc:0 "We need a heavier escort plane for our bombers, and of course Beakker has just the model we need. A triple-engine fighter plane that can outrange pretty much every single-engine fighter. The company boasts it could easily fly all the way to Equestria from Rottendedam. We haven't put that to the test yet, but the specifics of the craft look impressive."
FEA_air_bombing_5:0 "Beakker T.V"
FEA_air_bombing_5_desc:0 "To complement our bomber models, Beakker has made a heavy close air support craft. Armed to the teeth with machine guns and able to carry a ton of bombs, the T.V should massacre any ground forces that it catches. Beakker has warned us that rubber safety-coating around the fueltanks isn't standard in the design and that we probably should include it if the pilots don't want to be set ablaze by tracer rounds."
FEA_air_bombing_6:0 "Strategische Vernietiging"
FEA_air_bombing_6_desc:0 "Now that we have all the designs and aircraft we need, our air force can focus on perfecting the targeting of the enemy's strategic assets. If we improve our targeting, it will mean a higher percentage of bombs actually hit the target, effectively meaning that fewer aircraft can achieve the same goals."
FEA_airbase_expansion:0 "Expand the Airfields"
FEA_airbase_expansion_desc:0 "Our largest airfields are yet again in need of a major expansion. It will take some time to convince the populace that the extra noise from the overflying planes is a necessity. We probably have to compensate some of them, even, lest they start a protest group or even worse, an action committee."
FEA_rocket_project:0 "V-2 Rockets"
FEA_rocket_project_desc:0 "Beakker and his designers may have been busy with pioneering new aircraft designs, but an even more advanced form of aerial warfare is developing in parallel. The Versie-1 raket was merely a prototype, but the Versie-2 looks like it could actually do strategic damage to enemies, without risking the life of a pilot."
FEA_paratroopers:0 "Parachutistenbrigade"
FEA_paratroopers_desc:0 "Now that we have wrestled control from the skies, we could also drop something other than bombs back to the ground. It has been proposed that we make a special parachute brigade to glide down to the enemy. Several troops have complained that they can already fly and that a parachute would just slow down their descent and make them easy targets. Their complaints have been noted down for future reference."

FEA_government_problems:0 "Crisis in the Coalition"
FEA_government_problems_desc:0 "The coalition been plagued by instability for a while now, but recently it has been struck by complete disaster. Distrust within various factions of the coalition, both between each other and with the government in general have caused a total collapse of the coalition, and now there is no telling what the future will hold for Feathisia."

FEA_common_ground_lefties:0 "Common Ground"
FEA_common_ground_lefties_desc:0 "Despite what some radicals claim, the nobility do care for the griffons of Feathisia. Much of the FHP as well as a surprising number of the moderates in the PvdA have come together, uniting behind a common cry- "A" party for the Griffons!". This has caused conflict with the more radical socialists in the Labour party, but many members of both parties are just relieved that they will be a part of the new power bloc."
FEA_weird_fucking_coalition:0 "The FHP-PvdA Coalition"
FEA_weird_fucking_coalition_desc:0 "The formation of a coalition between the FHP and PvdA has been formalised, bringing together the two formerly desperate parties. They have attained a majority, and it seems like this new, strange coalition will be in control of the government for the time being."

FEA_the_FHP:0 "The FHP"
FEA_the_FHP_desc:0 "The Fethisische Hertogelijke Partij represents the interests of nobles, royalists and aristocrats. It wants to continue the old ways and support the rights of the upper class. Many support this party even without directly benefiting, as it promises a return to a stable and moderate government."
FEA_common_ground:0 "Common Interests"
FEA_common_ground_desc:0 "The FNV and LDP might be radically opposed on almost every account, but if Feathisia is to get through these trying times, compromises must be made. The gap between the beliefs of the two parties has been growing smaller, with more radical nationalists tapering off, and with more and more members of the LDP growing less adamant in their beliefs. Perhaps these two groups may unite, for the sake of the country?"
FEA_another_weird_coalition:0 "The LDP-FNV Coalition"
FEA_another_weird_coalition_desc:0 "The LDP and FNV have formally announced the creation of a coalition, encompassing both parties. While it doesn't appease the radicals of either side, it has managed to swing many members into supporting its creation. Many simply sigh in relief that the crisis is coming to an end, and a new government is being formed."
FEA_the_FNV:0 "The FNV"
FEA_the_FNV_desc:0 "The Fetisisch Nationalistisch Verbond is a group encompassing nationalist elements of the nation, united behind the ideas of a strong and prosperous nation. While it has been criticised by some liberals for its plans to restrict freedom and very negative attitudes towards minorities, the idea of a unified nation can appeal to almost any griffon in such chaotic times such as these."
FEA_attract_FHP_members:0 "Attract Members of the FHP"
FEA_attract_FHP_members_desc:0 "The FHP has lost much of its power after the collapse of the coalition, and many of the members who once turned to it for stability have grown nervous. By focusing our efforts on swinging them to our side, with promises of peace and a unified government, we can gain more supporters for our cause."
FEA_reconciliation_effort:0 "Reconciliation Efforts"
FEA_reconciliation_effort_desc:0 "During the crisis, many griffons who may have been moderate were radicalised, believing there was no hope for the old system. However, we have proven to be able to stand up to this test, and as such we may be able to swing such elements back into favouring us, if we are to reassure them of our stability."
FEA_against_extremism:0 "Fight Against Extremism"
FEA_against_extremism_desc:0 "Extremists on the left and right are taking to the streets, criticising the old ways and practically revolting from our rule.

FEA_appeal_to_moderates:0 "Appeal to the Moderates"
FEA_appeal_to_moderates_desc:0 "Many griffons in the FNV and PvdA do not fully agree with the most radical interpretations of their parties, simply wishing for more rights or a stronger government.

FEA_the_dukes_trust:0 "Earn the Duke's Trust... Again"
FEA_the_dukes_trust_desc:0 "The crisis did nothing to help the once supportive duke's views of our coalition, and now he is distrustful of the instability caused in the past. If we're to continue in restoring the old ways, we must gain back his trust in our system."

FEA_new_parliament:0 "Parliamentary Dealings"
FEA_new_parliament_desc:0 "With the collapse of the old parliament, we have no opposition to our creation of a more loyal cabinet. We can pick up the pieces of the old system and tie them together to support our party, made up of representatives of the workers and other loyal party members."
FEA_sideline_rozenkamp_brothers:0 "Sideline Rozenkamp"

FEA_work_with_others:0 "Break Bread"
FEA_work_with_others_desc:0 "Our rise to power has caused a stir within the rest of the nation.

FEA_railroad_projects_desc:0 "Our rural population is largely disconnected from the duchy at large. This cannot stay if we are to become a modern state.

FEA_support_local_companies:0 "Support Local Companies"
FEA_support_local_companies_desc:0 "Local artisans already have set up prosperous, if small, businesses in our cities and in many rural villages. It would be far easier and more efficient to promote the growth of these businesses than to attract entirely new investments."

FEA_deal_with_the_rest_desc:0 "Although Heeren is dead, his gang of ultranationalist thugs is still in the party. The LDP has demanded that we force them out. This is a great excuse to centralise party control."

FEA_memories_of_greater_feathisia_desc:0 "Our nation may be great, but we once were greater- and we still may return to our position as a great power in the region.

FEA_workers_rights_2_desc:0 "Kogchel had always planned for a package of labour laws to be passed through parliament, which would make the jobs of the commoner better off.

FEA_free_healthcare_2:0 "The Algemeen Ziekenfonds"
FEA_free_healthcare_2_desc:0 "Another one of Kogchel's ideas before the war was to reform healthcare in Feathisia with a general fund for health insurance. All the wounded and sick from the war will surely be relieved to hear that this plan is still a high priority."
FEA_direct_democracy:0 "Implement Direct Democracy"

FEA_rozenkamp_strasserists_desc:0 "Rozenkamp has fought hard during the civil war, sometimes using tactics and concepts that seemed to belong more to our enemies. His radical ideas have gained traction due to the war however, and some think he should be allowed to push through his will."
FEA_purge_opposition:0 "Purge the Opposition"

FEA_work_for_feathisia:0 "Work for the Fatherland"
FEA_work_for_feathisia_desc:0 "All griffons must know that Feathisia is being eyed up by its enemies. Those foreigners would leave nothing standing. To preserve our revolution, every griffon must give their all for the Leider and the Fatherland."
FEA_the_war_economy:0 "The Feathisian War Economy"
FEA_the_war_economy_desc:0 "Our industry must be geared for war. War is inevitable and if it does not come to us, we must seek it out. Therefore the common griffon will have to do with a little less, so that we can make the weapons necessary to win the upcoming conflict. To support these aims, we shall also commission a new factory for war."
FEA_the_new_heartland:0 "The New Age"
FEA_the_new_heartland_desc:0 "With the Heerschaar ready for war, supported by a new Feathisian socialist state, it is time we march on the capitalists. No imperialist will be left standing in the Red Tide that will sweep Griffonia! Victory or Death!"

FEA_purge_the_enemies_desc:0 "Those who sided against the army and with the traitorous communists, must be found.

FEA_armouries_on_every_corner:0 "Militarise the industry"
FEA_armouries_on_every_corner_desc:0 "The army cannot function without proper equipment. To make sure the country stays safe, we must construct new factories for arms production. The civilians should be grateful for the jobs."
FEA_a_puppet_duke:0 "A Ducal Puppet"
FEA_a_puppet_duke_desc:0 "We managed to find a member of the Weijermars family who is still alive. Even better, this griffon, Stefan Weijermars, somewhat agrees with our policies. He can be our puppet in front of the people, giving legitimacy to our government. The military always served the Grand Duke, after all."
FEA_mandatory_serivce_for_all:0 "Lower the Minimum Age"
FEA_mandatory_serivce_for_all_desc:0 "The previous government had all sorts of rules for who can be a soldier and who cannot. The civil war showed, however, that in an emergency, such rules blur and that even the younger griffons can fight perfectly well. Let us not be pretentious and lower the minimum age so all those who can, must protect the nation."
FEA_calibrate_the_economy:0 "Prepare the Economy"
FEA_calibrate_the_economy_desc:0 "Many threats from abroad seek to plunder fair Feathisia and take her riches for themselves. In the interest of safeguarding the country, the Duke will sign the industrial preparation law, which will make it so that key industries will come under control of the officers' council, so that they may best serve the state."
FEA_militarized_society:0 "A Militarised Society"
FEA_militarized_society_desc:0 "The rest of Griffonia often scoffs at Feathisia, a nation of sailors and traders. But just because we were rich, doesn't mean that we don't know how to fight. The army will show the way for the rest of the country. If foreigners want to laugh at us, let them come and test their mettle against the people of Feathisia."
FEA_partisan_warfare:0 "Prepare the People"
FEA_partisan_warfare_desc:0 "To prepare the Feathisians for threats from abroad, we will train every griffon, no matter age or profession in the basics of combat. Our partisans will provide support in the case of a conflict and should the dirty enemy defile our soil with their presence, they will find an enemy behind every blade of grass."
FEA_the_black_spot_of_griffonia:0 "The Black Spot of Griffonia"
FEA_the_black_spot_of_griffonia_desc:0 "Fences and guard towers have been put up at every border. All roads out of the country will be closed soon. Feathisia is all we will ever need and the military will ensure that the Feathisians will stay safe forevermore. Trying to leave the country is treason and will result in summary execution. Long live Feathisia!"

FEA_youth_groups_2:0 "The Jeugdwind"
FEA_youth_groups_2_desc:0 "The Jeugdwind, our youth organisation, has proven invaluable in rallying support and fighting during the civil war.

FEA_welfare_for_the_feathisian_2:0 "Nationaal Welzijnsprogramma"
FEA_welfare_for_the_feathisian_2_desc:0 "Way before the crisis, Moldernik proposed a nationalist welfare program to make sure no citizen would lack basic commodities. We had hoped to court the Reds with such a generous offer, but the talks broke down. It doesn't matter now, we will still show the Feathisians that the FNV takes care of her own."
FEA_eliminate_heeren:0 "Get Rid of Heeren"
FEA_eliminate_heeren_desc:0 "Heeren and his cronies have been allowed to ruin our good name for too long already. There is no police and there are no courts to stop us now. He will die as he lived, violently."
FEA_corporate_allies:0 "Corporate Allies"

FEA_state_unions_2:0 "Establish the Staatsvakbond"
FEA_state_unions_2_desc:0 "Labour Unions used to be a part of everyday life in Feathisia. They were often used by the reds to advance their political party and by lazy workers to undermine the national interest. We will merge all remaining unions into a State Union so that all workers are protected by a truly neutral entity."
FEA_grand_new_army:0 "Establish the Arendwachters"
FEA_grand_new_army_desc:0 "The Eagle Guards are the paramilitary units of the FNV and were our main fighting force in the early days of the civil war.

FEA_labour_battalions_2:0 "The Arbeidersbataljons Initiative"

FEA_feathisia_lives_again_desc:0 "When the Empire broke apart, we stumbled, but we marched on. When the economic crisis hit anew, we stumbled, but we marched on. When the Duke got shot we stumbled, but we marched on. In the civil war we almost fell, but Feathisia is still standing. And now, against all odds, Feathisia marches on!"
FEA_education_reform_fascist_2:0 "The Cadets"
FEA_education_reform_fascist_2_desc:0 "Now that the civil war is over, we have to rebuild our education system for modern times. We must merge military training and education together in one system. Only with discipline and willpower will our students shine."

FEA_oh_god_why:0 "Heeren's Takeover"
FEA_oh_god_why_desc:0 "In a moment of clarity produced by Heeren's speeches in front of the convention, the party swore an oath of loyalty to him. Now Godried Heeren, often labelled fantastic or insane, even by his political allies, holds the reigns of the apparatus of state."
FEA_literal_gestapo:0 "Establish the Geheime Staatspolitie"
FEA_literal_gestapo_desc:0 "A new secret police must be established. It is of the highest priority that all who oppose Heeren be found. No methods of interrogation or punishment are to be shied away from. Traitors to the cause deserve nothing but Tartarus, after all."
FEA_sentinels_integrated:0 "Integrate the Bronzen Schildwachten"
FEA_sentinels_integrated_desc:0 "Just as treason is to be punished, loyalty is to be rewarded. The Bronze Sentinels have been Heeren's closest supporters from the start and have formed an elite fighting force during the civil war. They will be allowed to form their own army units, loyal to their leader."
FEA_the_great_purge:0 "The Great Purge"
FEA_the_great_purge_desc:0 "Now that both the army and the secret police are both controlled by our loyal supporters, it is time to root out all the vermin from society. To fight a disease, the body of the nation must be aggressive and unrelenting. A purge will make our dearest Feathisia healthy again."

FEA_death_squads_desc:0 "Death, a Sentinel's death is our dearest wedding;\nFor the Gold and Blue, for the country;\nWe shall defeat forests and conquer mountains;\nNo traitor can frighten us, Nor any torture, or enemy storm;\nMay we all fall, hit in the forehead,\nDeath for Heeren is dear to us!"
FEA_liberty_through_work:0 "Freedom through Servitude"
FEA_liberty_through_work_desc:0 "Not all who oppose us are lost forever. A harsh lifestyle can purify most griffons. Work in labour camps with a harsh regimen and sparse food will rid them of any false beliefs. While the undesirables are in treatment, their contributions will help Feathisia grow strong again."
FEA_corporate_allies_2:0 "Allies in the Corporations"
FEA_corporate_allies_2_desc:0 "Some of the biggest corporations supported our ascend to power. By aligning their goals with ours, we can make use of their assets to reduce the industrial capacity we need to use for non-state purposes. Besides, our promises of war will surely help raise their profit."
FEA_labour_for_the_state:0 "Labour for the State"
FEA_labour_for_the_state_desc:0 "Many small businesses dot Feathisia, but there efforts could best be directed elsewhere. By nationalising and buying out smaller businesses and putting their machinery and employees to use in larger factories, we can acquire more industrial capacity. This is a big intervention in what is left of the private sector, but Heeren has other plans on how to grow the economy."
FEA_the_lion_roars:0 "The Lion Roars"
FEA_the_lion_roars_desc:0 "They called Heeren mad. They said that his plans were impossible and that Feathisians would never accept his rule. They were all proven wrong. And now the Lion of Feathisia roars again, ready to claw its way to glory. We are all behind Heeren and he shall lead us to our final victory!"

FEA_c_industry_1:0 "The Reconstruction"
FEA_c_industry_1_desc:0 "The civil war, following Duke Gerlach assassination, may have been brief, but it has crippled our economy for years to come. Unemployment is at an all time high, our industrial bases lies in ruin, and our infrastructure is destroyed and fragmented. Addressing these problems must be the top priority of any new government."
FEA_c_industry_2:0 "Geographical Survey"
FEA_c_industry_2_desc:0 "Feathisia covers a wide domain, with much of our lands poorly explored. The commission of a geographic survey, to properly prospect the fringes of our lands, may very well uncover a wealth of new resources. The development and utilisation of which, would go a long way in repairing our damaged economy."
FEA_c_industry_3:0 "Expand the Steel Industry"
FEA_c_industry_3_desc:0 "Our steel industry has always been plagued by a lack of mills and poor connectivity to the iron and coal seams used to supply it. By investing substantially into developing this sector, we could overcome these hurdles and begin to bridge the gap between us and our more industrialised rivals."
FEA_c_industry_4:0 "Dig for Chromium"
FEA_c_industry_4_desc:0 "Chromium is vital to modern metallurgy. The use of this element, in combination with steel, hardens it and makes it more resistant to corrosion. These benefits are especially vital within modern tank designs, with the most effective armours employing this steel-chromium metal. So, it is of great importance that we locate additional seams of chromium ore."
FEA_c_industry_5:0 "Synthetic Oil Experiments"
FEA_c_industry_5_desc:0 "Our lands are poor in oil, with only limited production taking place in Aiwle. This is frightening considering the importance of oil as a fuel in both industrial operations and military campaigns. However, technology would seem to aid our limited reserves, offering a way to turn our coal into a usable oil-like material. It is of vital importance that we seize this technology and implement it."
FEA_c_industry_6:0 "Rebuild the Railways"
FEA_c_industry_6_desc:0 "During the civil war, many of our rail lines were sabotaged or accidentally damaged in the fierce fighting for De Vleguels. This has made it incredibly difficult to transport goods around our country, severely stunting economic development. The repair of this infrastructure would go a long way in addressing our current economic woes."
FEA_c_industry_7:0 "Restructure the Industrial Sector"
FEA_c_industry_7_desc:0 "Few of our economic assets are in working order, with the vast majority left in a state of disrepair and dysfunction. In order to quickly reboot our economy, we must seize the few viable assets we posses and employ central planning to best guide them towards future repairs and development."
FEA_c_industry_8:0 "Support the Local Arms Industry"
FEA_c_industry_8_desc:0 "Our economy may lie in ruins, but the number of threats we face continues to grow. We must be assured that our soldiers have the supplies they need to fend off foes from abroad and crush enemies from within. To achieve this, we must completely nationalise all arms factories and factories related to military equipment, bringing them further inline with the central party."
FEA_c_industry_9:0 "Rebuild the Rottendedam Dockyards"
FEA_c_industry_9_desc:0 "Our reliance upon the port of Skyfall is what led to our initial economic woes. We must learn from our mistakes and build up our own domestic ports. This will help ensure that we never need to rely upon outside factors when securing our national prosperity."
FEA_c_industry_10:0 "Land Clearance"
FEA_c_industry_10_desc:0 "Vast swathes of our lands lie occupied by wilderness, denying us thousands of acres of virgin arable lands. Liberating these from nature would not only add tremendous benefit to our fragile economy, but also employ thousands left without work."
FEA_c_industry_11:0 "Resettle the Countryside"
FEA_c_industry_11_desc:0 "The influx of new arable lands has overwhelmed our existing farmers, leading to much of them going fallow. As such, if we wish to properly exploit these acres, we must bring in labour from our cities. This policy would also have the added benefit of offering a new opportunity to the urbanised population displaced by civil war."
FEA_c_industry_12:0 "Modern Industrial Methods"
FEA_c_industry_12_desc:0 "Equestria stands as the chief industrial power of the world, aided by a wealth of innovators, assets, and cutting-edge technologies. If we wish to reach such a level of development, we must replicate this model. We can do this by acquiring Equestrian patents upon the black market and hiring skilled individuals who don't have scruples taking our money."
FEA_c_industry_13:0 "Electronics Research"
FEA_c_industry_13_desc:0 "Electronics are the future, offering us assistance with research, a means to secure code, and a method to detect enemy aircraft. These technologies could tip a future war in our favour and any investment made towards them now, would pay dividends for decades to come."
FEA_c_industry_14:0 "Support the Mirabelle University"
FEA_c_industry_14_desc:0 "The Mirabelle University is one of Feathisia's crown jewels. For centuries it has taught our citizens courses in a wide range of subjects including engineering, medicine, and various other fields. However, in recent years it has suffered from reduced enrolment and donations, as our economy declines. We must resolve these problems by offering official government support and funding to the university."
FEA_c_industry_15:0 "Finish the Reconstruction"
FEA_c_industry_15_desc:0 "The damage caused by our civil war has finally been remedied, ushering in a new era of wealth and prosperity. The economy of today may be radically different to that of years ago, but our people are well-fed, employed, and sheltered. We stand as the hallmark example of why our political philosophy is the future."

FEA_martial_law:0 "Martial Law"
FEA_martial_law_desc:0 "Martial Law has been instituted to deal with the political chaos in the nation. Grand Duke Gerlach apparently has a solution planned which will ensure the parties will never create such a ruckus again."
FEA_disband_parliament:0 "Disband Parliament"
FEA_disband_parliament_desc:0 "It is clear that the idiots that call themselves politicians have no clue how to run a country. They wouldn't be able to pick what's for dinner without causing a fight. No matter, they will soon be taken care of."
FEA_deal_with_PvdA:0 "Deal with the PvdA"
FEA_deal_with_PvdA_desc:0 "The Partij van de Arbeid's unrealistic plans and anti-monarchist rhetoric was always a torn in our side, but now they have grown completely unreasonable. They occupy the factories and refuse to work, although they were always the ones clamouring for more jobs. Very well, there is always another way to reduce unemployment."
FEA_pull_them_out:0 "Pull the Rot Out"
FEA_pull_them_out_desc:0 "These spoiled citygriffons have never worked a hard day in their lives. Let us rid ourselves of them and instead build factories in the countryside, where hardworking loyalists can use the employment. Pull them out of the factories. No matter the cost."
FEA_socialist_begone:0 "Annihilate the Red Front"
FEA_socialist_begone_desc:0 "With the factories going back under our control, we will take care of the Communists' organisation. By purging the land clean of their leadership and breaking any spirit left to continue the resistance. If they want a Red Front so badly, we will paint their doors with their blood."
FEA_deal_with_LDP:0 "Deal with the LDP"
FEA_deal_with_LDP_desc:0 "The Liberals always presented themselves as our friends and allies. But now it is clear that they were only looking towards their own goals and were completely disinterested in properly running the country. It matters not, their pathetic Liberation Front won't free them from our just revenge."
FEA_liberals_get_noose_too:0 "The Day of the Rope"
FEA_liberals_get_noose_too_desc:0 "We must arrest all these 'peaceful' protesters that keep breaking order on the streets. Once we get them all arrested, we will show what happens when you scream for freedom but refused to work for it when you had the chance."
FEA_deal_with_the_ringleaders:0 "Kill off the Ringleaders"
FEA_deal_with_the_ringleaders_desc:0 "Now that they are without support, we must press on and find the ringleaders of this pathetic protest. Talonsley and his supporters must be eliminated once and for all. Only afterwards can we build up Feathisia into what it was always meant to be."
FEA_deal_with_the_FNV:0 "Deal with the FNV"
FEA_deal_with_the_FNV_desc:0 "The FNV and their bands of thugs claim to be patriots. They claim to know the will of the people and the right direction for the country. Yet they sow mutiny in the ranks of the army and fight the forces of stability in the streets. We will show them what leadership looks like."
FEA_strangle_the_leadership:0 "Cull the Military"
FEA_strangle_the_leadership_desc:0 "The van Vorst tot Vorsts call themselves nobility, but it is clear that their line has lost all sense of honour. Meanwhile the upstarts Moldernik and Heeren have always been our adversaries. We will show our dear citizens what happens when a general commits treason."
FEA_butcher_the_paramilitaries:0 "Butcher the Paramilitaries"
FEA_butcher_the_paramilitaries_desc:0 "Now that the proper soldiers are taken care of, the paramilitaries of Heeren and Moldernik are the next to go. They have devolved into nothing more than an unruly mob, driven like cattle by their fascist slave drivers. If they behave like cattle, we shall treat them as such."
FEA_dukes_country:0 "The Duke's Country"
FEA_dukes_country_desc:0 "Now that the upstarts and the criminals of society have been taken care of, the Grand Duke can finally focus to doing what he loves, taking care of Feathisia and her well-meaning citizens."
FEA_dukes_education:0 "The Duke's Education Reforms"
FEA_dukes_education_desc:0 "The incompetent coalition that ruled the country before never bothered to reform the education system. We warned that it would mean the country would lose its competitive edge, but other things were considered more urgent by the liberals. We will just have to do it faster and more rigorously then."
FEA_dukes_proper_science_base:0 "Ducal University Grants"
FEA_dukes_proper_science_base_desc:0 "The best, most deserving young griffons will be allowed free access to university. The universities will be oases of higher learning, free from all disruptive influences. The talents that are taught in this way will surely amaze their elders with their bright ideas!"
FEA_the_dukes_army:0 "The Duke's Army"
FEA_the_dukes_army_desc:0 "Many citizens simply desire new stability in their lives and nothing helps more than the army. It is both a stable source of payment and provides a rhythm and discipline to your life. On the other hand it is an excellent way for citizens to help their peers by protecting the vulnerable from any attack. We will take personal control over the army to ensure all goes well."
FEA_new_generals:0 "Promote Loyal Officers"
FEA_new_generals_desc:0 "There has been a lack of generals due to some internal issues with the Feathisian military. Luckily, many lower ranking officers have shown loyalty in the face of adversity. We will promote them to a higher rank to fill the gaps in leadership."
FEA_the_dukes_secret_service:0 "Establish the DGDvdH"
FEA_the_dukes_secret_service_desc:0 "The Duke's Secret Service, while lacking a stylish acronym, is absolutely necessary to make sure none of the citizenry gets misguided by foreign influences or their own stupidity. The secret agents will be given broad powers to monitor and interrogate any suspicious griffon, for their own sake."
FEA_new_officer_core:0 "A New Officer Corps"
FEA_new_officer_core_desc:0 "The Duke has always had an eye for talent and with him inspecting new officer recruits personally, the quality of the Corps has improved tremendously. These new recruits will be given the finest education and the best manuals available. This way Feathisia's leadership will make Gerlach proud!"
FEA_dukes_armouries:0 "Arm the Nation"
FEA_dukes_armouries_desc:0 "Although the nation's internal affairs are largely in order, Feathisia still faces many threats. To survive the coming storms, the military will need to be well armed. The Grand Duke has foreseen this and has ordered the construction of several new arms factories."
FEA_crush_remaining_dissidents:0 "Crush Any Remaining Dissidents"
FEA_crush_remaining_dissidents_desc:0 "Even now, some griffons are simply too stubborn to learn their lessons. No matter, we are always prepared to teach the truth."
FEA_banker_loyalty:0 "Ensure the Bank's Loyalty"
FEA_banker_loyalty_desc:0 "The banks never ceased to back us during these troubled times. We will return the favour and make sure that Feathisia will stay a safe place to invest in, for mutual benefit of both parties."
FEA_the_privy_council:0 "Empower the Privy Council"
FEA_the_privy_council_desc:0 "The Grand Duke's Council has always been a neutral player in the politics of the nation, but it is clear that these wise griffons are needed now more than ever. Their prudent leadership will help us to rebuild the country."
FEA_ancient_claims:0 "Push Ancient Claims"
FEA_ancient_claims_desc:0 "The Grand Duke sees clearly now. Mismanagement of state affairs is not a sickness that only plagued Feathisia. Over the borders the citizens have it even worse. Gerlach has some ancient familial claims to push on these regions. He really hates war, but he is willing to wage it for the common good of Griffonkind."
FEA_industrial_council:0 "Establish the DIRvdH"
FEA_industrial_council_desc:0 "To better coordinate efforts between big business and the state, the Ducal Industrial Council will be created. Comprising of businessgriffs and bureaucrats, this council will provide the Grand Duke with the information he needs to help Feathisia get the most out of its economic strengths."
FEA_a_swamp_griffonian_on_the_throne:0 "Protect Grover's Legacy"
FEA_a_swamp_griffonian_on_the_throne_desc:0 "Emperor Grover V was a close friend of the Grand Duke and after his demise, his successors squandered the values he once stood for. Feathisia has always remained loyal to the Emperor's legacy, even after his death. For the future of Griffonia, we will secure the throne for ourselves."


FEA_recalibrate_the_economy:0 "Recalibrate the Economy"
FEA_recalibrate_the_economy_desc:0 "Feathisia is still suffering from the effects of the last economic crisis. One issue, which has lingered unresolved, is that our economy is too large and lacks sufficient markets to sate its surplus productivity. We can kill two birds with one stone by channelling a portion of this surplus away from the civilian sector and towards our arms industry."
FEA_d_infrastructure_project:0 "Massive Infrastructure Projects"
FEA_d_infrastructure_project_desc:0 "The Feathisian economy suffers from two problems. The first is that there is still a significant portion of our population without stable employment. The second is that our duchy's infrastructure is severely underdeveloped, leading to stunted economic growth. We can resolve both of these issues by investing public money into further developing our transport network."
FEA_d_arms_factories:0 "Expand the Arms Industry"
FEA_d_arms_factories_desc:0 "For years, the arms industry in Feathisia has been incredibly small. This not only denies us access to a whole industry, in which to derive economic benefit, but also leaves us at risk in the face of invasion. To address both of these issues, Duke Gerlach has mandated the expansion of our military-industrial complex."
FEA_steelworks:0 "Grand Steelworks Projects"
FEA_steelworks_desc:0 "Feathisia is a land rich with iron and coal. However, our steel industry is hindered by a lack of mills and infrastructure. In response, Duke Gerlach has called for the construction of new mills. These will more than double our existing output."
FEA_oil_experiments:0 "Synthetic Oil Experiments"
FEA_oil_experiments_desc:0 "Oil is the lifeblood of a modern mechanised army. Without it, we'd be reduced to hauling our equipment upon our backs or with pack animals. This reality is trouble to Duke Gerlach, as our duchy is poor in the resource. However, there has been recent technological breakthroughs which have seen the conversion of coal into a usable oil-like fuel. It may be possible to adapt this research to our needs."
FEA_ducal_dockyards:0 "Trade With the World"
FEA_ducal_dockyards_desc:0 "The goods of Feathisia once had access to the world market. However, due to the recent instability of Skyfall, we've found ourselves unable to trade with anyone except for our immediate neighbours. In order to address this, Duke Gerlach calls for an expansion of the Rottendedam port facility. No longer will we need to rely upon others to export our goods."
FEA_d_labour_battalion:0 "Establish the Werkbrigades"
FEA_d_labour_battalion_desc:0 "Construction offers an outlet for us to productively utilise our excess labour force. After all, the factories of tomorrow must be built today."
FEA_d_factories:0 "Expand the Industrial Sector"
FEA_d_factories_desc:0 "For decades, our duchy has relied upon the wealth generated from agricultural goods to finance its operations. This is not the way a modern state should operate. Instead, Duke Gerlach has called for the financing of industrial projects within the heartland of our duchy. Not only will these employ thousands, but they'll also bring Feathisia in line with the rest of the developed world."
FEA_d_agrarianism:0 "Support Agrarianism"
FEA_d_agrarianism_desc:0 "There has been growing discontent amongst our nobles over the recent push towards industrialisation. They fear that any further actions, taken to modernise our state, would only further weaken their position within society. We must re-assure these nobles that they are not at risk, and that their productivity is still vital to our society."
FEA_d_modern_methods:0 "Modern Industrial Methods"
FEA_d_modern_methods_desc:0 "Equestria stands as a beacon of technological innovation, housing some of the world's brightest minds. This has allowed Equestria to eclipse the rest of the world in sheer industrial prowess. If Feathisia wishes to reach this might, it must begin to learn from the Equestrian model. In order to achieve this, Duke Gerlach has released funds to lease Equestrian patents and hire skilled Equestrian talent."
FEA_d_engineering_uni:0 "The Ducal Engineering Academy"
FEA_d_engineering_uni_desc:0 "Engineering is the future. Every machine, electrical device, and artificial chemical requires the input of engineers somewhere in its design and production. In order to facilitate this growing demand for engineers, Duke Gerlach has called for the establishment of the Ducal Engineering Academy. This facility will take the finest of Feathisian minds and turn them into a future generation of engineers."
FEA_d_state_unions:0 "Establish the Staatsvakbond"
FEA_d_state_unions_desc:0 "Prior to the attempt on Duke Gerlach's life, unions within Feathisia were a breeding ground for dissenting politics. It was not uncommon for these unions to be led by members of the LDP or PvdA, who acted more towards political goals than actually representing their members. In response, Duke Gerlach has created a single state union which will represent all workers in a politically neutral manner."
FEA_d_war_economy:0 "The Feathisian War Economy"
FEA_d_war_economy_desc:0 "Our military is woefully under-equipped in dealing with its enemies, both domestic and foreign. In order to facilitate a much-needed military build-up, our economy must be recalibrated in such a manner that the armed forces get priority in terms of industrial, productive, and natural resources."
FEA_d_finish_economy:0 "Finish Calibration"
FEA_d_finish_economy_desc:0 "Our economy has never been stronger. We have complete employment, a developed industrial base, an infrastructure network rivalled by few, and a large military which shall protect our citizens. All of this has been provided under the watchful gaze of Duke Gerlach."

FEA_the_throne:0 "The Throne is Ours"
FEA_the_throne_desc:0 "We have done it! We have conquered the imperial throne for ourselves, and we are the Empire reincarnate! This is a glorious day, but we must not rest for too long. There are now many new enemies we face, and there is much work that needs to be done."
FEA_protection_alliance:0 "The Aristocrats"
FEA_protection_alliance_desc:0 "The lands of the Empire are filled with aristocrats, and sadly, many of them are quite... incompetent at their job. We must see to it that these nobles are removed at once."
FEA_PYT_dealing:0 "Deal with Greifenheim"
FEA_PYT_dealing_desc:0 "The Duchy of Greifenheim to our south is weak and defenceless. Its leadership must come to realise that they are weak alone. As part of the Empire, they are part of something greater and stronger. "
FEA_core_PYT:0 "Integrate Greifenheim"
FEA_core_PYT_desc:0 "With the lands of Greifenheim now safely under our control, we can start integrating it into the core parts of our Empire. Together, we are strong!"
FEA_BRZ_and_STW:0 "Look to the North"
FEA_BRZ_and_STW_desc:0 "To our north are the Duchy of Strawberry and the County of Bronzehill. We must ensure their loyalty to the Empire, and the only way to do so appears to be through brute force."
FEA_core_BRZ_and_STW:0 "Integrate the North"
FEA_core_BRZ_and_STW_desc:0 "The North is ours, and we can now pacify the towns and countryside to ensure their absolute loyalty to us. Our northern flank is safe. For now."
FEA_the_south:0 "The Faithful"
FEA_the_south_desc:0 "Down to the south is a group of religious aristocrats that are eager for a fight. They hold on tight to their religious beliefs and trust in the Archons, but that will not save them."
FEA_ROU_and_YAL:0 "Deal With the Yale"
FEA_ROU_and_YAL_desc:0 "The Yale are nothing but reckless bandits, nowadays. Their "government", if it can even be called such, seems to ignore banditry on the countryside and the raiding of entire villages. We must intervene immediately and safe the griffons of Yale from this horrific group of criminals!"
FEA_core_ROU_and_YAL:0 "Integrate the Yale"
FEA_core_ROU_and_YAL_desc:0 "The Bandits have been defeated. Now, it is time for imperial law and order to return to these lands, so that groups such as the Bandits can not rise to prominence again."
FEA_KAT_and_ANG:0 "Tame Angriver and Katerin"
FEA_KAT_and_ANG_desc:0 "The Duchies of Angriver and Katerin are unstable and treacherous duchies, nothing more. We must bring order to these lands at once!"
FEA_core_KAT_and_ANG:0 "Integrate Angriver and Katerin"
FEA_core_KAT_and_ANG_desc:0 "With the traitors defeated, we can finally let peace return to the lands of Katerin and Angriver. Henceforth, imperial rule and law shall keep the region stable and in its place."
FEA_the_empire_rises:0 "The Empire Rises"

FEA_reclaim_north:0 "Reclaim the North"
FEA_reclaim_north_desc:0 "The North, like the majority of the Continent, rightfully belongs to the Empire, and is home to the old republican rebels that once started the rapid decline of the Empire. We must destroy this vile rebellion once and for all, and reconquer the rest of the north with them!"
FEA_core_north:0 "Northern Reintegration"
FEA_core_north_desc:0 "Northern Griffonia is safely within our claws, once more. It's time to stop fighting and let peace return to these lands, once more."
FEA_reclaim_center:0 "Reclaim Central Griffonia"
FEA_reclaim_center_desc:0 "Central Griffonia is the heart of the Continent and, most importantly, home to Griffonstone, the place where the Empire was first founded and ruled from. We cannot allow for others to hold onto such a historic plot of land!"
FEA_core_center:0 "The Birthplace of Griffonkind"
FEA_core_center_desc:0 "Finally, after many, many years, the Empire returns to its birthplace. But not just the birthplace of the Empire, but the birthplace of all griffons. Let us honour this place and celebrate its return to the fold."
FEA_reclaim_west:0 "Reclaim the West"
FEA_reclaim_west_desc:0 "The West is home not only to the great Skyfall trading ports, which also houses the old imperial fleet, but our old rivals of Aquileia also live here. The Discrets once rejected imperial rule and declared themselves independent many years ago. We shall undo this mistake."
FEA_core_west:0 "The Western Provinces"
FEA_core_west_desc:0 "The important provinces to our west are now part of the Empire, once more. We must make sure to secure these lands as soon as possible, so that we can hold onto them, for sure."
FEA_reclaim_south:0 "Reclaim the South"
FEA_reclaim_south_desc:0 "The reconquest of the south has been a long-living dream of every supporter of the Empire. The treacherous griffons of Wingbardy were the staunchest of rivals the Empire has ever faced, and they were the very first to declare independence when the Empire began its downfall. Now, we are back, and stronger than ever."
FEA_core_south:0 "The Southern Triumph"
FEA_core_south_desc:0 "The division and fall of the Empire once started by the claws of Wingbardy. Now, its reunion and reclamation ends with it, as well."
FEA_reclaim_colony:0 "Reclaim Nova Griffonia"
FEA_reclaim_colony_desc:0 "The Colony of Nova Griffonia, too, declared its independence from us many years ago. While it was not very important to us back then, it is now, and we must make it clear to them that we are still their masters."

FEA_the_unwilling_grand_dictator:0 "The Unwilling Dictator"
FEA_the_unwilling_grand_dictator_desc:0 "Edgar Pechvogel, a public servant, has been given dictatorial power by both the warring parties in the civil war. Let us hope he will turn out to be a natural leader in this great crisis."
FEA_emergency_conscription:0 "Emergency Conscription"
FEA_emergency_conscription_desc:0 "After running through the numbers, Pechvogel has decided that the army will need more griffons to hold back the invader. We will convince the parties of the mathematical truth behind our proposals so we can instate more extensive conscription."
FEA_hasty_fortifications:0 "Last Minute Fortifications"
FEA_hasty_fortifications_desc:0 "We have to defend ourselves and our fortifications were not maintained or unmanned when the enemy attacked! We will make teams of volunteers and civil engineers to construct emergency defensive works!"
FEA_militias_raised:0 "Call Upon the Militias"
FEA_militias_raised_desc:0 "When the civil war formed, many militias started patrolling the big cities to keep their homes save during the violence. These militias must now defend their homes once more, from a foreign invader. They might not be the best equipped troops, but we must go all in to defend Feathisia!"
FEA_mobilize_the_nation:0 "Mobilise the Nation"
FEA_mobilize_the_nation_desc:0 "Every citizen must set aside their notions of class and ideology for a greater cause, the cause of their homes.

FEA_we_are_strugling_together_desc:0 "No matter if you are communist or liberal, fascist or noble, we all share the country we live in. We all have griffons back home we must protect. Let us put aside our petty differences for now and look to our defences. Together, we might just stand a chance."
FEA_merge_paramilitaries:0 "Merge the Paramilitaries"
FEA_merge_paramilitaries_desc:0 "The Gold Talons, the Bronze Sentinels and all the other paramilitary units Feathisia has must be merged together. Ideology is simply not a factor we must consider when the existence of Feathisia itself is on the line. We will open up these paramilitaries for griffons from all sorts of backgrounds, so that all may fight for the cause."
FEA_a_new_centrist_army:0 "The New Feathisian Army"
FEA_a_new_centrist_army_desc:0 "Pechvogel will personally oversee a radical reorganisation of the military. It can become more effective and less wasteful easily, if the generals would stop and listen to his advice, the army will soon run like clockwork."
FEA_centrist_labour_laws:0 "The Arbeidswetten"
FEA_centrist_labour_laws_desc:0 "Pechvogel will quickly introduce new laws to protect the workers. Slightly modified from the original PvdA proposals as to not reduce the efficiency of factories much, these work laws instead improve both efficiency and security, striking the perfect balance."
FEA_centrist_agraranism:0 "Agrarianism"
FEA_centrist_agraranism_desc:0 "The late Duke always championed the countryside and we must indeed not focus our efforts on any one region of the country. By embracing agrarianism we will win back the support of the griffons living in the countryside."
FEA_centrist_unions:0 "The Poldermodel"
FEA_centrist_unions_desc:0 "A veteran of bureau politics, Pechvogel knows all about making compromises. The radical parties are working together in a way they never thought possible before, all for a singular goal. Pragmatism and de-escalation trump ideology and wishful thinking in every debate. "
FEA_centrist_labour_squads:0 "NRS Arbeidersbataljons"
FEA_centrist_labour_squads_desc:0 "Originally a FNV idea, Pechvogel has chosen to institute a modified version of the Arbeidersbalatjons to make sure many Feathisians are always available to help do crucial tasks."
FEA_education_reforms_centrist:0 "Educational Reforms"
FEA_education_reforms_centrist_desc:0 "The education system of Feathisia is really just a mess, constructed by changing coalition with different priorities. We will put scientists and teachers themselves in charge of finding the best ways to modernise the schools."

FEA_increase_science_base_centrist_desc:0 "We will abolish outdated laws and customs to make our society function in a modern way. Although some may protest, it is absolutely necessary to cut the Red Tape."
FEA_centrist_youth_groups:0 "The New Jeugdwind"
FEA_centrist_youth_groups_desc:0 "The youth organisation of the FNV might be objectionable to some, but the way they train the youth instils discipline and a sense of duty in them. These values will help them in these dire times. We will restructure the griffscouts and merge them with the Jeugdwind to create an all-Feathisian youth organisation."
FEA_free_education_centrist:0 "De Leerplicht"
FEA_free_education_centrist_desc:0 "Young griffons often don't see the importance of their own education and choose to be adventurous or work early instead. By making education mandatory, we will make sure every griffon reaches their true potential."

FEA_what_the_fuck_is_this_abomination_desc:0 "It is clear that not all differences between the different parties in society will be solved. We will make a system where the leaders of the parties can work together, while the common griffons can live separated in their own organisations. All parties will get their own organisations and representatives to keep the peace."


### Events ###
feat.1.t:0 "Saving the Economy"
feat.1.d:0 "Parliament debated the budget today and it was an unusually heated deliberation by Feathisian standards. Two budget plans for the next years were put forward, one by the Ministry of Finance and one by the ministry of Economic Affairs. The first one would try to balance the books and let the market save the economy, while the second one proposed an interventionist policy. As one of the delegates requested a roll call vote, the representatives announced their decision one by one. The result determined the economic future of the entire Grand Duchy."
feat.1.a:0 "We can rely on the free market."
feat.1.b:0 "We must take drastic measures!"

feat.2.t:0 "Protests"
feat.2.d:0 "Due to the recent increase in taxes, massive protests have been organised throughout our duchy. While peaceful in origin, it can not be ignored that the protesters are aiming increasing criticism at the LDP and FHP. They claim that the coalition is using their position of power to protect the landed elite and foreign investors."
feat.2.a:0 "This is for your own good!"

feat.3.t:0 "Kogchel's Speech"
feat.3.d:0 "In response to the recent cuts in government spending, leader of the PvdA, Gerben Kogchel, has criticised the leading coalition for working against the common citizen. In his speech, he calls the cuts to art grants and environmental protections a dangerous first step in the road to stripping the civil and economic liberties of the commoner. While his speech received a lukewarm reception in the House of Representatives, it has picked up some traction amongst the urbanised working class, who have aligned themselves against further austerity."
feat.3.a:0 "Yes, that's very nice, now go back to your seat."

feat.4.t:0 "MP Defections"
feat.4.d:0 "As opposition to the current economic policy of the LDP-FHP coalition mounts, a number of FHP MPs have grown worried about their prospects for re-election. These MPs come from districts which have been hit especially hard by the austerity of De Vleguels. In response, they have split away from the traditional FHP party and have allied themselves with the FNV caucus, in the hope that they will be properly represented in a future FNV government."
feat.4.a:0 "Who needs them?"

feat.5.t:0 "Plight of the Farmer"
feat.5.d:0 "Recent actions by the coalition government have seen the displacement of many landed farmers, turning thousands into landless tenants. The story of these poor individuals, removed from their ancestral lands, has recently reached the press, bringing their story to the entirety of Feathisian society. In response to this story, the FNV has added a declaration to their party platform which would overturn the recent nationalisation of farms, returning the lands to their proper owners."
feat.5.a:0 "Such a moving speech."

feat.6.t:0 "Noble Donations"
feat.6.d:0 "One of our nobles has returned from a highly profitable venture to the River Federation. Upon seeing the economic hardship of our people, he has decided to invest a majority of his proceeds into a series of economic projects in his home state.\n\nAt the opening ceremony, for the first of these project, he gave a speech praising the level-headed governance of the LDP-FHP coalition, thanking them for their years of faithful service."
feat.6.a:0 "A thanks to our stiff-necked friends!"

feat.7.t:0 "Work for the Unemployed"
feat.7.d:0 "The recent economic depression has left many of our citizens unemployed and without stable income. In order to address this, our government has begun to finance large public work projects. These will not only create tens of thousands of construction jobs but also go a long way in helping to remedy the underdeveloped infrastructure of our duchy."
feat.7.a:0 "Focus on the infrastructure projects."
feat.7.b:0 "Focus on the industrial projects."
feat.7.c:0 "Focus on both projects."

feat.8.t:0 "Support For the Farmer Welfare Act"
feat.8.d:0 "The rural population of Feathisia has been hit exceptionally hard by our current economic depression. This is due to the price of many agricultural goods crashing as demand and markets shrink.\n\nTo address this problem, the Feathisian House of Representatives has passed the Farmer Welfare Act. This allows the government to act as a buyer of agricultural goods, creating a market where it might not otherwise exist. Hopefully, this will return a degree of financial stability to our rural areas."

feat.12.d:0 "Crowds of FNV supporters have gathered in the streets once more to witness a speech from the party leader. With his signature impassioned ways, he managed to rile up the crowd with his concerns about the economic crisis. He promises that the FNV will make Feathisia into a great and prosperous nation once more, free of toxic influences that do nothing but leech off of the griffons that call it home. He called out the current government's inaction and promised that procedures and political games wouldn't stop the FNV from doing what's right for the country."

feat.13.d:0 "Disaster has struck in the riverside city of Mirabelle, after a local gunpowder factory was given over to control by the workers. A series of mistakes caused by inexperience in managing and running the facility has lead to a tragedy, with the factory erupting in an explosion that shook the whole city. There are few survivors, and it has caused many to grow weary of such changes in management."

feat.14.t:0 "The Cosa Nostra Scandal"
feat.14.d:0 "The opening of our markets to foreign capital has been a success overall, all of our economists agree. However, the lax control and regulation on foreign investments has created a significant problem.\n\nA number of Wingbardian criminal families have slipped through our law enforcement and have established themselves in several Feathisian cities. Their initial impact mostly went by unnoticed, as they didn't cause any real trouble with their illegal racketeering. Almost all of the affected labourers are foreigners, and the services and products that they sold have shown to be beneficial to the growth of their respective industries, raising few eyebrows. The few officials who did attempt to investigate into these operations were bribed and there is no concurrent investigation in any of these operations.\n\nThis changed when violence erupted between two rival crime families, killing several innocent bystanders and destroying several local businesses and shops in the port city of Rottendedam.\n\nWith the public now fully aware of what has taken place, many are publicly questioning our economic and judicial policies that have allowed for the establishment of 'The Cosa Nostra' in our country."

feat.15.d:0 "Landbouwbeurs, or land fairs, are agricultural expos where producers of both agricultural products and technology show off their wares to the rural denizens of our domain.

This relay computer is based on a Wingbardian design and can calculate several hundred complex algorithms an hour.\n\nHe hopes that his invention can revolutionise the field of mathematics and has already envisioned banking organisations using ARRDVs to manage their money. Perhaps, he suggests, that one day, everygriffon would have an ARRDV in their home."

feat.19.t:0 "Controversy"
feat.19.d:0 "In light of the recent developments in government policy, increasing criticism has been levelled at Grand Duke Gerlach IV.

feat.20.t:0 "Heeren's Grand Speech"
feat.20.d:0 "Rottendedam was gripped with excitement and dread as the FNV Deputy Godfried Heeren gave a speech to a crowd of fanatic supporters and onlookers. In his speech he addressed the struggling economy of Feathisia, stating that the reasons for these economic malaise were Feathisia's unstable and hawkish neighbours, constantly warring with each other. Furthermore he blamed the inept businessgriffs and bureaucrats leading Skyfall whom he called out for caring little for the average Griffon, rather only worrying about lining their own pockets. More worryingly Heeren also blamed the local Pony population of Rottendedam, calling them parasites and leeches who only seek to work against the interests of Feathisia and her people. Heeren's fiery speech and bold accusations naturally sparked outrage amongst most of the population. However it seems that in spite of this the Bronzen Schildwachten branch of the FNV just became a lot more popular..."

feat.21.t:0 "For My Sentinels"
feat.21.d:0 "In an economic slump unlike many others, it is impressive to see new books being published, in this case it is a single best seller written by the FNV Chief Deputy Godfried Hereen. Titled 'To My Sentinels' the book details his time spent training with the Orangecoats, the paramilitary arm of the Bronze Sentinels, one of the many far-right parties that were integrated into the FNV. He is quite proud of the organisation, and considers them to be the safeguards of Feathisian ideals, history, and identity. This had caused all manner of speculation within the Duchy, leading many to believe he had received funding from some powerful friends within the government, or perhaps even foreign aid? Only time will tell however, as it just surpasses the recently published 'Daring Do' novel. "

The PvdA and FNV fraction leaders shouted accusations at the prime minister, while the LDP also attacked them. At the end of the debate, which lasted until well after midnight, the opposition announced a vote of no confidence.\n\nWhen Feathisia woke up next day, the country learned that the government had been voted out, signalling the continuation of a turbulent time for the Grand Duchy.

feat.29.d:0 "Our duchy is plagued by illiteracy, with the vast majority of our population unable to read or write effectively. This severely hampers economic growth, as our population is often unable to access materials which could expand their skill base.\n\nThis illiteracy has been aided by an archaic education system. Access to it is limited, with only two methods available. The first, is for rich families who are able to afford tutors or tuition to boarding school. The other, is via the charity of the church. Though this source is limited in scope and resources.\n\nIn order to address our illiteracy, the government of Feathisia calls for the establishment of a Ministry of Education. This ministry would use government funds to establish public schools, while being supported by a government mandate which calls for every child between 6 and 12 to be enrolled in some form of education."

An assassin fired three bullets at Heeren, who was giving a speech in a large brewery hall. The assailant was heard shouting something about the revolution and the workers and is assumed to be a communist, although he got away. Angered at such a blatant murder, Anton Moldernik has called for the government to do something against the PvdA, but the justice department has declined, stating that there is no solid evidence the Labour Party even had anything to do with the attack. If it was a communist plot, it may proof to be counter-productive, however, as the absence of Heeren has eased tensions between the liberals and the nationalists, improving the chances of the coalition surviving."

Bronze Sentinels erected barricades, holding up portraits of their leader and shouting prayers to Arcturius to send them a new champion. The insurrection caused several army units and the police to be called in. The Bronze Sentinels dug in and announced that any attempts to break their insurrection would lead to violence. For weeks on end, the centre of Rottendedam was under siege, the Sentinels slowly starving, but unwilling to give up.\n\nWhen their rations depleted, the radicals elected to sally out, unwilling to fall into the hands of the authorities. Although the battle was fierce and the Sentinels did not retreat an inch, they were no match for the disciplined soldiers of the Feathisian Army. This was effectively the end of the Bronze Sentinel organisation's relevance."

Realising that their radical wing is losing them votes, now that moderate solutions are saving the day in Feathisia, Moldernik has announced a change in course. He has booted Heeren and his radical Bronze Sentinels from the party. Heeren has issued a furious statement and to say that he disagrees with this decision would be an understatement.

They had hoped that if they could secure several key buildings and get the loyalty of the army, they could take over the country.

Needless to say, this has publicly embarrassed the FHP, and many of its scandalised members have openly renounced their support for the party."

While such a trial would hardly be newsworthy, he has captured the attention of griffons throughout the nation by claiming that he was arrested and put on trial due to the fact he was Wingbardian, and not the crime itself.\n\nMany high ranking LDP supporters have spoken out in favour of Valletti's case, citing a lack of evidence and an the fact that no other griffon has been arrested for using the wrong bathroom before. However, there are many who still call for Valletti to receive the harshest sentence he can get, many of which are supporters of the FNV.\n\nWith the final hearing taking place, the nation is on the edge of its seat."

feat.39.d:0 "A local Rottendedam official has discreetly approached the government with regards of an offer that he has received from one of the local Wingbardian crime families. Somehow they've caught wind that the Feathisian army is still short on rifles to consider all of our divisions properly armed, and are willing to give a substantial cache of rifles from the Griffonian Frontier in exchange for law enforcement to turn a blind eye to some of their more... egregious activities.\n\nOur local government representative at Rottendedam knows that allowing this free reign will only hurt the public faith in government institutions, and had originally intended to arrest the culprits to then publicly showcase a 'judicial victory' against a well-entrenched adversary. However, he too knows about the current supply problem in the army, and decided to ask how he should respond to the offer."

feat.41.d:0 "In an effort to co-operate better with our new allies and friends, the PvdA has decided to get rid of the fringe faction led by the Rozenkamp brothers. They led a group that advocated for a mix between nationalism and a focus on class conflict, with a radical hatred of nobility and the Empire especially. These believes simply have no place in our party anymore, which is why Kogchel has booted them. Feathisia is left wondering what a world would look like under the Rozenkamps, who were a colourful voice in Feathisian politics with their often self-contradicting rhetoric."

His eyes glistered and he shouted praise at the nobleman while he approached. The Grand Duke frowned little but then gave the griffon a smile. When the griffon was close, he rapidly pulled a gun from under his coat and fired several rounds at the Grand Duke. Although most hit non vital organs, one of the bullets penetrated Gerlach's skull. The entire nation prayed for the Duke as he entered treatment, his person being one of the only things holding Feathisia together."

After a final meeting to try and restore balance, the FNV and PvdA realised their differences were irreconcilable, especially now that the radicals in their parties were gaining strength.\n\nWith both sides opting to duke it out on the field of battle instead, the fascists have started to rally soldiers to their cause, while the communists have raided several armouries and distributed weapons to so called 'workers militias.' The battle for Feathisia has begun."

feat.44.d:0 "After a long and hard struggle for control over key cities and provinces, the PvdA, consisting mostly of workers' militias along with several loyal army units has won the civil war by mounting a last assault on de Vleugels, waving the Red Flag over the Parliament building. The civil war has radicalised supporters of the party. Rozenkamp's mix of nationalism and communism and Stappenbeld's more straightforward central communist ideas now compete with the ideas of party leader Kogchel, who still hopes for a somewhat moderate solution."

feat.45.t:0 "Martial Law"
feat.45.d:0 "In a speech broadcast to every radio in Feathisia, Grand Duke Gerlach spoke from his manor. Apparently the attempt on his life scarred him greatly. His calm and collected composure couldn't hide an undertone of seething anger in his voice. Declaring that the political and economic situation is out of control, the Duke took direct control over the armed forces and issued martial law until the situation is back under control. Many Feathisians received the news of the Grand Duke taking over with joy. He was quite possibly the most reasonable griffon in the country and they expected Feathisia to soon be back to normal again."

Except for the Socialist banner hanging proudly in the hall, the place looks abysmal. Shattered glass at the feet of the windows that used to make the chamber light, chairs missing and the portrait of the late Duke stood below where it hung, turned around so the delegates didn't have to look into his judging eyes. Grizzled civil war veterans, ex PvdA members of parliament and union representatives have gathered to try and get the country back into shape.\n\nThree major options have presented themselves. Kogchel, the old leader of the moderate wing of the PvdA, could be entrusted to power. He appeals to reason and the old tradition of Feathisian democracy, hopeful that from the ashes a utopia can rise. Stappenbeld leads the communist faction. A fringe in the old PvdA, the communists have gained more traction during the civil war. Finally, the militant Rozenkamp brothers take the stage. Delivering a fiery speech about how they helped defeat capitalism and that the revolution can only be safeguarded by moulding Feathisia into what amounts to a National-Communist Police State, they find cheers of support amongst the veterans from the war. As the delegates cast their votes after a day of heated debate, the parliament building falls silent, as each griffon realises that their vote might be decisive in shaping the future of Feathisia."

Instead of a traditional parliamentary democracy, Kogchel has opted for a system of direct democracy. This radical new way of governing will, in his mind, help heal the wounds left behind by the civil war. At the very least, the first reactions are positive, as many griffons are now drafting their own proposals to make the socialist dream become a reality."

feat.49.t:0 "The Leider"
feat.49.d:0 "Herman Rozenkamp has completely changed the face of Feathisia. His National Revolution has led to purges and many restrictions to the freedoms Feathisians were used to. But he has decided more is needed to cement his control over the country. He made the PvdA change its name to the National Bolshevik Party and he renamed his own title.

FNV Party members, war heroes and representatives of Feathisia's largest industries have gathered to decide their next move.\n\nGrim faced and donning the uniform of the old Feathisian Army, Baron Herman of Vorst tot Vorst sits amidst his staff. He had sided with the FNV early on, but now that the party was close to power, he realised they couldn't protect the country. It was no matter, his soldiers surrounded the building. One signal and Feathisia could be his, he had but to cast the die.\n\nThe two hotheads of the party, meanwhile, were debating which policies to take and it was becoming clear that a decision for party leadership had to be made. Moldernik defended, in broad senses, the same policies the FNV stood for before the civil war. Heeren, however, flanked by his Bronze Sentinels, argued that the war was not over until Feathisia got rid of every last traitor. He was charismatic in a way only an insane griffon really could be and many in the manor got swept up in the moment to support him. In the moment of truth..."

In front of a crowd of mostly military officers, Stefan Weijermars recited the oath to protect the people and the lands of Feathisia, entrusted to him by the grace of the Gods. Afterwards, the inexperienced Grand Duke, visibly shaking, watched from the balcony as soldiers parading past, both for festivity's sake and to show the noblegriffon were the true power lay in the military dictatorship."

His corpse was riddled with bullets and a letter was found that accused him of treason against his own Bronze Sentinels. Angered at such a blatant murder, Anton Moldernik ordered the arrest of all Bronze Sentinel leaders and declared the organisation suspended. Many griffons secretly let out a sigh of relief, since Heeren's policies were considered extremist even by FNV standards.

All over the country, citizens witnessed the same scene. Their neighbours, friends or colleagues got sentenced to firing squads by local commanders. Although some citizens protested against the purge, such actions were immediately and brutally suppressed. The griffons got the message, any opposition to Heeren's rule will be considered treason. With the traitors out of the way, Heeren now holds the country in his bronze claw, his commands obeyed unquestioned.

feat.54.d:0 "Grand Duke Gerlach, in a surprising turn of events, announced that parliament would be dissolved with an emergency decree effective immediately. Although the FHP politicians mostly went quietly, the police had to drag the other politicians out of their offices. Some didn't believe that such a decree could be real and the first few minutes the politicians thought it was a bad joke. When the politicians and their staff realised the decree was real, chaos ensued.\n\nThe collective LDP party tried to occupy parliament and failed as police threatened to open fire on the harmonists. Meanwhile FNV Deputy Heeren got into a claw fight with a police officer and had to be dragged out by three policegriffs while he was screaming about betrayal. Gerben Kogchel, leader of the PvdA, was spotted carrying a suitcase with papers of his social security plans and some swore that there was a tear rolling down his face. Crowds of Feathisians from De Vleugels watched with unbelief as one by one, their representatives were kicked out of the parliament building. At the end of the day, the monument to Feathisian democracy stood empty, guarded by police officers."
feat.54.a:0 "They left us no choice."

feat.55.t:0 "The Red Front"
feat.55.d:0 "After writing the Grand Duke a lot of angry letters, Gerben Kogchel gave up and caved to the demands of the party to take direct action. Flanked by Rozenkamp and Stappenbeld, his more radical allies, the Labour leader announced the general strike. Giving a passionate speech about democracy and the right of the common griffon, he was interrupted by Rozenkamp, who laid out the plan for the Red Front. They would occupy the factories and the dockyards. The workers would starve the economy, which would force the Grand Duke into surrender."
feat.55.a:0 "As was foreseen, to Tartarus with them."

feat.56.t:0 "The Feathisian Liberation Front"
feat.56.d:0 "Arjen Talonsley, long time minister and leader of the Liberaal Democratische Partij, headed a party conference today in De Vleugels. Many FHP members had joined him today and the harmonists decided on what to do. The party wasn't militant or controlled any factories like the reds did. They were not used to being stopped by police officers from exercising their basic rights. After a day of intense debate, votes were had on what to do. The party decided to form the Feathisian Liberation front and to follow the example of famous harmonists before them by protesting peacefully in any way possible. No noble, police officer or government worker would be able to cross the street, without being reminded that they were not working for a democratic state anymore."
feat.56.a:0 "I used to call these griffons my friends."

feat.57.t:0 "The Fatherland Front"
feat.57.d:0 "Anton Moldernik received his allies in a closed room. His deputy, Heeren, who had really risen to the occasion of rallying the patriots to their side, sat next to him. The Barons of Vorst tot Vorst, some of the most influential generals in the army, sat across from him. They had finished planning their uprising. Heeren's Bronze Sentinels would engage the police and the Duke's loyalists in the streets, while the generals would try to prepare the soldiers for a coup, but at the least keep the military from crushing the resistance. The Front for the Restoration of the Fatherland, or the Fatherland Front for short, was born."
feat.57.a:0 "They don't love Feathisia the same way as I do."

feat.58.t:0 "The Day of the Rope"
feat.58.d:0 "The past month or so, more and more of the liberal protesters were thrown into overcrowded cells. Feathisia was clearly not ready to deal with so many prisoners at once and the wardens were relieved to hear that the cells would soon be empty yet again. Last night, stages were erected, on which devices most Feathisians only knew from stories from more savage places on the world were assembled. Gallows. In the morning, the prisons were emptied and the inmates taken to the execution grounds.\n\nThe killings took all day, the liberals taking their punishment in grim silence. In Luxwingburg a policegriff puked on the stage, disgusted by what he had to do. In Grieslein, the first griffon that tried to do the deed collapsed unconscious then and there, his replacement was heard saying sorry to his victims, crying out loud until the tears simply stopped coming. The Feathisia which the world knew vanished on that day, the Day of the Rope."
feat.58.a:0 "They shouldn't have crossed me."

feat.581.t:0 "Mass Executions in Feathisia"
feat.581.d:0 "We keep hearing troubling reports from Feathisia. The Grand Duke Gerlach, who was a supporter of constitutionalism and a reasonable Griffon by all accounts, appears to have gone completely mad. Disgusting reports have surfaced about him arresting hundreds of peaceful pro-democracy protesters, who were just advocating for their rights. Even worse, the Grand Duke appears to have murdered them all. Should we step in?"
feat.581.a:0 "Denounce them!"
feat.581.b:0 "We should turn a blind eye."

feat.582.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] Has Publicly Denounced us!"
feat.582.d:0 "[From.GetNameDef] has imposed sanctions on the Grand Duke, his family and key members of the ruling nobility. They cite our recent actions to stabilise the country as 'crimes against harmony.' The Grand Duke has reacted furiously to the accusations, but there is little we can do as of yet."
feat.582.a:0 "They upset the harmony in Feathisia, not me!"

feat.59.t:0 "The Vorst tot Vorst Trial"
feat.59.d:0 "The courtroom was packed with griffons, as the suspects in this case were simply too special. The nationalist Barons van Vorst tot Vorst were being judged for treason against the Grand Duke and the elder brother had decided to do the defence himself. Many such cases were had against soldiers the last few days, but this one was against two of the most well-known figures in the country. Both of them must have known the judge's verdict before the trial started, but it did not stop Herman to give a passionate plea. His voice commanded the room and not even the judge had the spirit to silence him. After an hour of lecturing the Feathisians on the values of their country and how his only crime had been patriotism, the general simply saluted the court, followed by his brother. Raising their voices, the two started to sing the age-old national anthem of the Grand Duchy, but the visitors were too scared to join in.\n\nAfter this display the room was silent while the judge seemed to hesitate, before he remembered his instructions and announced the verdict. Death by firing squad. It was rumoured that the generals personally shook claws with the soldiers that were chosen for the deed and commended them for their bravery, before silently facing their deaths."
feat.59.a:0 "They did put the show in show trial."

feat.60.t:0 "The Duke's Country"
feat.60.d:0 "Feathisia is run by one single Griffon now, Grand Duke Gerlach. The noble rules with an iron claw, but somewhere his good intentions still linger. Some of his plans are brilliant and altruistic, while some are based only on paranoia. It is a confusing time for the common Feathisian, who on the one hand sees his daily life improving, but on the other hand has his freedoms taken away. Whatever the case, the Grand Duke has asserted his dominance over the country and will rule it for the foreseeable future."
feat.60.a:0 "Long live the Duke!"

feat.61.t:0 "The Feathisian Marriage"
feat.61.d:0 "Duchess Gabriela, this is a happy day! The Grand Duke of Feathisia, Gerlach the fourth, has asked you for a royal marriage! The request was brought to the imperial palace by him and his guard personally, during your last session of the imperial council.\n\nGerlach is still here, and he eagerly awaits your response to his request. Your majesty, will you marry this old but soft-hearted Griffon?"
feat.61.a:0 "Yes!"
feat.61.b:0 "One-eyed Griffons aren't my types..."

feat.62.t:0 "The Feathisian Marriage"
feat.62.d:0 "Duchess Gabriela, this is a happy day! The Grand Duke of Feathisia, Gerlach the fourth, has asked you for a royal marriage! The request was brought to your castle by him and his guard personally while you were gone.\n\nGerlach is still here, and he eagerly awaits your response to his request. Your majesty, will you marry this old but soft-hearted Griffon?"
feat.62.a:0 "Yes!"
feat.62.b:0 "One-eyed Griffons aren't my types..."

feat.63.t:0 "The Duchess Accepts!"
feat.63.d:0 "After much consideration, Duchess Gabriela Eagleclaw and Grand Duke Gerlach met in a long, dimly-lit hallway, staring each other down. Gerlach, nervous at her response, began shaking mildly.\n\nHis nervousness was for nothing though, as the Duchess approached him and grabbed his claws, proudly and happily exclaiming "Yes! Yes!".\n\nThis is a great day for the Duke, and a great day for all of us!"
feat.63.a:0 "This is a glorious day!"

feat.64.t:0 "Rejected"
feat.64.d:0 "With a heavy heart and tears in his eyes, the Grand Duke returns to his home. The Duchess, whom he had secretly loved for quite some time now, was apparently very vocal that she did not share the same affection. The Duke has wished to be left alone for the remainder of the day, trying to process the happenings of today."
feat.64.a:0 "There are plenty more fish in the sea..."

feat.65.t:0 "The Battle for Rottendedam Harbour"
feat.65.d:0 "The Civil War has come to Rottendedam, the great harbour city of Feathisia. The cargo cranes lay deserted and many ships float aimlessly next to the docks. Many of the citizens of the city form the core supporters of the FNV party and even a large part of the Bronze Sentinels come from its poorest neighbourhoods. The PvdA has directed the dockworkers that were prepared to join into a militia and has begun to try and capture key points in the city, but support is being rushed in form outside to break the FNV stranglehold on the city. The fate of Rottendedam hangs in the balance. Just how much is the Labour Party is willing to sacrifice to capture the all-important harbour?"
feat.65.a:0 "The FNV easily secures victory!"
feat.65.b:0 "the PvdA takes over the city after a bloody siege."

feat.66.t:0 "The Battle of Buckmour Station"
feat.66.d:0 "Buckmour is a key city where roads and railways connect from Rottendedam and Skyfall to Mirabelle and De Vleugels. The faction that manages to wrestle control of the Railway Station will be able to better supply their troops for a final assault. The PvdA has organised the Railway Union Militia to hold their ground, while the FNV has armed and rallied the farmers from the more rural parts of Buckmour state to assault the city."
feat.66.a:0 "The FNV manages to secure the area."
feat.66.b:0 "The PvdA secures victory!"

feat.67.t:0 "The Siege of Mirabelle"
feat.67.d:0 "Mirabelle is one of the older cities of Feathisia and one of the first to industrialise. Both older brick factories and new factory halls dot the city, which houses many workers. The PvdA has traditionally always been strong in this area, where the struggle for workers used to be a struggle for life or death. It has become so again as battle lines are drawn in the city. The FNV knew that this was the heart of the Red Resistance and that if they did take the city, it would be a devastating blow to the morale of their enemies. On the Central Grover Boulevard, communist leader Rozenkamp ordered a big banner to be placed, hanging over the city street; 'They shall not pass!' Would the fascists be able to take on the fanatical resistance of the PvdA?"
feat.67.a:0 "We have passed, now tear that banner down."
feat.67.b:0 "They haven't passed! A victory for the worker!"

feat.68.t:0 "The Battle for Aiwle"
feat.68.d:0 "Aiwle is home to the only oil in the country, which does not only fuel industry and cars in peacetime, but can fan the industry of war during a conflict. The FNV has a slight advantage in this area, as several army units guarded Aiwle during peacetime. They now face-off against a rag-tag militia of drillers, miners and communists. Who will secure the oilfields?"
feat.68.a:0 "The FNV secures the oil fields."
feat.68.b:0 "The PvdA secures the oil fields."

feat.69.t:0 "Skirmishes on the Central Plains"
feat.69.d:0 "The Central Plains are the least populated areas of Feathisia, with little tactical or strategic significance. The population, however, is not less fanatical in their beliefs and have taken to fighting each other. With their forces evenly matched, outside help by either of the factions might proof the decisive factor in who gets the Plains."
feat.69.a:0 "The FNV outmanoeuvers and encircles the Reds."
feat.69.b:0 "The PvdA forces the Nationalists to retreat."

feat.70.t:0 "The Luxwingburg Gambit"
feat.70.d:0 "Luxwingburg is one of the smaller industrial cities of the country and has been quietly taken over by the PvdA. Now Baron Herman van Vorst tot Vorst plans a decisive attack to beat back the militias that are holding the streets. The FNV general plans to use Bronze Sentinels and some of his most elite units to sneak through the forest surrounding the city and attack at night. With the city lit up by lights, it is hard to spot a griffon emerging from the dark forests. When he secures a foothold in the city, the general will order an artillery barrage on the far side of Luxwingburg to confuse the enemy into thinking a pincer move is in progress. The general is quite confident in his abilities, however, no plan survives contact with the enemy..."
feat.70.a:0 "The Gambit works and the FNV wins!"
feat.70.b:0 "The PvdA rallies and secures the forests."

feat.71.t:0 "The Battle for Reitscheid"
feat.71.d:0 "The mining towns of Reitscheid have always been core supporters of both radical parties, with their high concentration of low educated workers. Now the mining explosives are being used to detonate bridges and as makeshift grenades. The forces of the FNV and the PvdA are evenly matched in tenacity and numbers. Who will take Reitscheid and its valuable raw materials?"
feat.71.a:0 "The FNV wins the day."
feat.71.b:0 "The PvdA wins the day."

feat.72.t:0 "The Assault on Rimau"
feat.72.d:0 "The old city of Rimau was taken by us from Romau a long time ago. The citizens there speak a dialect in between Feathisian and Imperial. Regardless, Rima province has been dragged into the civil war. Although the city is being ruled from the university building by an impromptu workers council, the countryside has started to form brigades to take the city and put a halt to communist expansion in the state. Who will march triumphantly through the cobblestone streets of Rimau?"
feat.72.a:0 "The FNV takes the old university."
feat.72.b:0 "The PvdA pacifies the province."

feat.73.t:0 "The FNV is Victorious"
feat.73.d:0 "After a long and hard struggle for control over key cities and provinces, the FNV, consisting mostly of the regular army along with Jeugdwind cadets and Bronzen Schildwachters, has seized the day. A final assault on the old ducal residence in De Vleugels has eliminated the PvdA's leadership. The civil war has radicalised supporters of the FNV party. Heeren's sentinels played a vital part in securing victory and he has claimed a more prominent role, rivalling Moldernik himself. Time will tell whether Feathisia will recover from the war."
feat.73.a:0 "Glory to Feathisia!"

feat.74.t:0 "The Rima Question"
feat.74.d:0 "With Feathisia embroiled in a civil war, we have gotten a letter from the mayor of Rimau. They have requested us to march in and take the city before violence takes over his State, as it has done in so many other places. Rima used to belong with Romau in ancient times, so it would only be natural if we take it back. Only to protect these griffons from harm, of course."
feat.74.a:0 "Seize our moment!"
feat.74.b:0 "I never did like Rima anyway..."

feat.75.t:0 "The Grand Truce"
feat.75.d:0 "The Empire strikes us when we are most vulnerable! Although the strife of civil war has divided the country to the heart, we must all set aside our ideological differences in defence of the fatherland we hold so dear. We must beat back the Imperials, but who will keep the hotheads of the PvdA and the FNV from fighting each other?"
feat.75.a:0 "Boreas preserve us..."

feat.76.t:0 "The Unwilling Dictator"
feat.76.d:0 "After searching the ministries in De Vleugels for days for someone suitable, Kogchel and Moldernik, Heeren and Rozenkamp even, agreed on a griffon. Edgar Pechvogel, a public servant for the ministry of finance has been chosen to lead the new government. He was undisputedly one of the figures that helped limit the effects of the economic crisis and all parties agreed that his approach was so neutral that he could not possibly hold any bias. In a rushed ceremony in what was left of the parliament building, mister Pechvogel was declared dictator of Feathisia and given power to do whatever it takes to win the war."
feat.76.a:0 "Long live Pechvogel!"

feat_news.1.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]It appears that in the aftermath of the Feathisian civil war, a griffon called Stappenbeld has been chosen as a leader by the PvdA party.

However, he has persevered and implemented leftist reforms. The griffon has also instituted a radically new form of democracy, where important matters are voted on directly by the populace. It appears Feathisia has returned to a democracy, even after these troubling times."

feat_news.3.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Feathisia has been ruled by the Rozenkamp brothers for a while. They seized power after the PvdA party won the civil war. The country now adores the elder brother as their 'Leader' and the people get bombarded with a mix of nationalist and communist propaganda. At the rate at which the country is forcibly industrialised, it looks like they are preparing to pick a fight with the Griffonian Empire sooner rather than later."

feat_news.6.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Following the recent marriage between Grand Duke Gerlach of Feathisia and Duchess and imperial regent Duchess Eagleclaw of Strawberry, it has seemed to many within the Griffonian Empire that the Duke was increasingly prominent within imperial politics, some even suggesting that he was more active than the Duchess herself.\n\nToday, the Duchess has formally resigned from her post as imperial regent, and instead transferred the title over to her husband. Many within the imperial nobility were outraged at this decision, and asked for Duchess Gabriela's motives, but she refused to answer.\n\nThe Empire once again has a new leader. Only time will tell how determined he really is."

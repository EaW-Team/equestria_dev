### Ideas ###
FEA_crashed_economy:0 "Ruined Economy"
FEA_crashed_economy_desc:0 "Feathisia has always been one of the richest constituent states of the Griffonian Empire, with flourishing trade and adventurous explorers bringing the Duchy great wealth. The nigh constant warfare across the continent that followed the crumbling of the Griffonian Empire had pushed the economy to the brink. Now Skyfall, Feathisia's greatest trading partner, has fallen into chaos, with the bankruptcy of the firms that traded with the Trade Federation causing a ripple effect through the economy. Dealing with the economy should be the first priority of the Feathisian government"
FEA_beloved_monarch:0 "Duke Gerlach the Silent"
FEA_beloved_monarch_desc:0 "Grand Duke Gerlach IV Weijermars is known far and wide as one of the most reasonable leaders in Griffonia. The Duke, who earned his nickname ‘The Silent’ for his patience and calm, transformed his fief into the very first proper Constitutional Monarchy in Griffonia. The people of Feathisia love their Grand Duke and as long as he keeps listening to the concerns of his Griffons, this is unlikely to change"
FEA_danger_in_the_coalition:0 "Crisis in the Coalition"
FEA_danger_in_the_coalition_desc:0 "The recent economic troubles plaguing Feathisia have lead to a divide between the ruling FHP-LDP Coalition, and allowed for more extreme parties to gain prominence within the Parliament. If the issues within the Coalition are not addressed properly it could lead to a general collapse of the Government"
FEA_gov_inter:0 "Ruined Economy"
FEA_gov_inter_desc:0 "Feathisia has always been one of the richest constituent states of the Griffonian Empire, with flourishing trade and adventurous explorers bringing the Duchy great wealth. The nigh constant warfare across the continent that followed the crumbling of the Griffonian Empire had pushed the economy to the brink. Now Skyfall, Feathisia's greatest trading partner, has fallen into chaos, with the bankruptcy of the firms that traded with the Trade Federation causing a ripple effect through the economy.

FEA_free_mark:0 "Ruined Economy"
FEA_free_mark_desc:0 "Feathisia has always been one of the richest constituent states of the Griffonian Empire, with flourishing trade and adventurous explorers bringing the Duchy great wealth. The nigh constant warfare across the continent that followed the crumbling of the Griffonian Empire had pushed the economy to the brink. Now Skyfall, Feathisia's greatest trading partner, has fallen into chaos, with the bankruptcy of the firms that traded with the Trade Federation causing a ripple effect through the economy. Dealing with the economy should be the first priority of the Feathisian government"
FEA_sluggish_economy:0 "Sluggish Economy"
FEA_sluggish_economy_desc:0 "While our economic reforms have managed to find quite a bit of success Feathisia's economy is still yet to fully recover. While the worst is now over, we still need to pull through and finish our reforms, if we want to get back to pre-crisis growth levels. The worst is over and it should be uphill from here. Our economic analysts are mildly optimistic and soon the treasurer might no longer have to say no to every other minister who comes to ask for a bigger budget."
FEA_banker_support:0 "Banker Support"
FEA_banker_support_desc:0 "Our decision to bailout the suffering banks within our borders, both Feathisian and International, had a side effect that may not have been entirely intentional. The Griffonian financial elite has heard of our ‘reasonable’ policies and has decided to support us. It can never hurt to have some friends who fly in high places."
FEA_worker_right_idea:0 "Arbeidswetten"
FEA_worker_right_idea_desc:0 "The Arbeidswetten, more commonly known to international observers as the Feathisian Labour Laws, are a package of laws designed to protect the rights of the working griffon. It contains laws for fair wages, workplace protection and working hours."
FEA_free_healthcare_idea:0 "Algemeen Ziekenfonds"
FEA_free_healthcare_idea_desc:0 "The General Sickfund is the national health insurance of Feathisia. Although wealthier Feathisians can still insure themselves privately, the Feathisian government now makes it possible for those poorest griffons to get an insurance for themselves. Instead of giving a compensation to patients, the Sick Fund pays the bills directly, with the sick or injured workers never seeing a single bill. Even the way the fund is financed is a unique Feathisian compromise, with the worker paying some part directly, paying a percentage of their income and the employers also chipping in themselves."
FEA_mass_contruction_projects:0 "Arbeidsplan"
FEA_mass_contruction_projects_desc:0 "To keep every griffon working in these trying times, great public projects should be undertaken. Your education or background does not matter, every claw can hold a shovel! Be they parks, canals or bridges, we will find some project to work on for our jobless."
FEA_citizen_welfare:0 "Sociaal-Economische Raad"
FEA_citizen_welfare_desc:0 "The Socio-Economic Council is an idea proposed by the Harmonist factions in parliament. In it, trade unions and employers’ organizations meet together to try and find common grounds. The council had a rough start, but they are slowly getting used to cooperating, which will surely lead to both fairer working rights and less strikes. The griffons of Feathisia are learning that compromise can find a solution that works for all parties."

feat.20.t:0 "Heeren's Grand Speech"
feat.20.d:0 "Rottendedam was gripped with excitement and dread as the FNV Deputy Godfried Heeren gave a speech to a crowd of fanatic supporters and onlookers. In his speech he addressed the struggling economy of Feathisia, stating that the reasons for these economic malaise were Feathisia's unstable and hawkish neighbors, constantly warring with each other. Furthermore he blamed the inept businessmen and bureaucrats leading Skyfall whome he called out for caring little for the average Griffon, rather only worrying about lining their own pockets. More concerningly Heeren also blamed the local Pony population of Rottendam, calling them parasites and leeches who only seek to work against the interests of Feathisia and her people. Heeren's fiery speech and bold accusations naturally sparked outrage amongst most of the population. However it seems that in spite of this the Bronzen Schildwachten branch of the FNV just became a lot more popular..."

feat.21.t:0 "For My Sentinels"
feat.21.d:0 "In an economic slump unlike many others, it is impressive to see new books being published, in this case it is a single best seller written by the FNV Chief Deputy Godfriend Hereen. Titled 'To My Sentinels' the book details his time spent training with the Orangecoats, the paramilitary arm of the Bronze Sentinels, one of the many far-right parties that were integrated into the FNV. He is quite proud of the organization, and considers them to be the safeguards of Fethsian ideals, history, and identity. This had caused all manner of speculation within the Duchy, leading many to believe he had received funding from some powerful friends within the government, or perhaps even foreign aid? Only time will tell however, as it just surpasses the recently published 'Daring Doo' novel. "

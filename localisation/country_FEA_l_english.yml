FEA_crashed_economy:0 "Ruined Economy"
FEA_crashed_economy_desc:0 "Feathisia has always been one of the richest constituent states of the Griffonian Empire, with flourishing trade and adventurous explorers bringing the Duchy great wealth. The nigh constant warfare across the continent that followed the crumbling of the Griffonian Empire had pushed the economy to the brink. However, Skyfall, which gained its independence after the Republican uprising of 978, has managed to outcompete Feathisian merchants, pushing the economy over the brink into deep recession. Dealing with the economic crisis should be the first priority of the Feathisian government."
FEA_beloved_monarch:0 "Duke Gerlach the Silent"
FEA_beloved_monarch_desc:0 "Grand Duke Gerlach IV Weijermars is known far and wide as one of the most reasonable leaders in Griffonia. The Duke, who earned his nickname 'The Silent' for his patience and calm, transformed his fief into the very first proper Constitutional Monarchy in Griffonia. The people of Feathisia love their Grand Duke and as long as he keeps listening to the concerns of his Griffons, this is unlikely to change."
FEA_danger_in_the_coalition:0 "Crisis in the Coalition"
FEA_danger_in_the_coalition_desc:0 "The recent economic troubles plaguing Feathisia have lead to a divide between the ruling FHP-LDP Coalition, and allowed for more extreme parties to gain prominence within the Parliament. Especially Gerben Kogchel, leader of the social democratic PvdA and Anton Moldernik, leader of the nationalist FNV, have taken advantage of the chaos. If the issues within the Coalition are not addressed properly it could lead to a general collapse of the Government."
FEA_gov_inter:0 "Ruined Economy"
FEA_gov_inter_desc:0 "Feathisia has always been one of the richest constituent states of the Griffonian Empire, with flourishing trade and adventurous explorers bringing the Duchy great wealth. The nigh constant warfare across the continent that followed the crumbling of the Griffonian Empire had pushed the economy to the brink. However, Skyfall, which gained its independence after the Republican uprising of 978, has managed to outcompete Feathisian merchants, pushing the economy over the brink into deep recession. Dealing with the economic crisis should be the first priority of the Feathisian government."
FEA_free_mark:0 "Ruined Economy"
FEA_free_mark_desc:0 " Feathisia has always been one of the richest constituent states of the Griffonian Empire, with flourishing trade and adventurous explorers bringing the Duchy great wealth. The nigh constant warfare across the continent that followed the crumbling of the Griffonian Empire had pushed the economy to the brink. However, Skyfall, which gained its independence after the Republican uprising of 978, has managed to outcompete Feathisian merchants, pushing the economy over the brink into deep recession. Dealing with the economic crisis should be the first priority of the Feathisian government."
FEA_sluggish_economy:0 "Sluggish Economy"
FEA_sluggish_economy_desc:0 "While our economic reforms have managed to find quite a bit of success Feathisia's economy is still yet to fully recover. While the worst is now over, we still need to pull through and finish our reforms, if we want to get back to pre-crisis growth levels. The worst is over and it should be uphill from here. Our economic analysts are mildly optimistic and soon the treasurer might no longer have to say no to every other minister who comes to ask for a bigger budget."
FEA_banker_support:0 "Banker Support"
FEA_banker_support_desc:0 "Our decision to bailout the suffering banks within our borders, both Feathisian and International, had a side effect that may not have been entirely intentional. The Griffonian financial elite has heard of our 'reasonable' policies and has decided to support us. It can never hurt to have some friends who fly in high places."
FEA_worker_right_idea:0 "Arbeidswetten"
FEA_worker_right_idea_desc:0 "The Arbeidswetten, more commonly known to international observers as the Feathisian Labour Laws, are a package of laws designed to protect the rights of the working Griffon. It contains laws for fair wages, workplace protection and working hours. Furthermore restrictions on unionising will be lifted to protect the right of collective action for labourers."
FEA_free_healthcare_idea:0 "Algemeen Ziekenfonds"
FEA_free_healthcare_idea_desc:0 "The General Sickfund is the national health insurance of Feathisia. Although wealthier Feathisians can still insure themselves privately, the Feathisian government now makes it possible for those poorest Griffons to get an insurance for themselves. Instead of giving a compensation to patients, the Sick Fund pays the bills directly, with the sick or injured workers never seeing a single bill. Even the way the fund is financed is a unique Feathisian compromise, with the worker paying some part directly, paying a percentage of their income and the employers also chipping in themselves."
FEA_mass_contruction_projects:0 "Arbeidsplan"
FEA_mass_contruction_projects_desc:0 "To keep every Griffon working in these trying times, great public projects should be undertaken. Your education or background does not matter, every claw can hold a shovel! Be they parks, canals or bridges, we will find some project to work on for our jobless."
FEA_citizen_welfare:0 "Sociaal-Economische Raad"
FEA_citizen_welfare_desc:0 "The Socio-Economic Council is an idea proposed by the various different factions in the parliament. In it, trade unions and employers' organisations meet together to try and find common grounds. The council had a rough start, but they are slowly getting used to cooperating, which will surely lead to both fairer working rights and less strikes. The Griffons of Feathisia are learning that compromise can find a solution that works for all parties."
FEA_agrarian_idea:0 "Agrarisme"
FEA_agrarian_idea_desc:0 "We have embraced the philosophy of agrarianism. The Griffon who works the earth is a true Feathisian. We will promote a simple life in the countryside as an important part of our culture and create a class of loyal farmers as the backbone of our nation."
FEA_labour_battalion_ideas:0 "Arbeidersbataljons"
FEA_labour_battalion_ideas_desc:0 "Patriotic unemployed Griffons have been assigned to the Workers battalions. These groups will be used to quickly complete certain projects. Construction projects of vital importance and of course repairs to damaged factories and infrastructure. Additionally, contingents of these Griffons will be placed under command of our engineers to help entrench our troops. Any Griffon who will fall in service of their battalion will receive a medal."
FEA_state_union:0 "Staatsvakbond"
FEA_state_union_desc:0 "The State Union is a way to finally stop the influence of the meddling labour unions. By having labour under state control, we have made more straightforward regulations and wage contracts that favour us. This has increased our production, with only an acceptable loss in labour conditions."
FEA_farmer_funds:0 "Farmer-Fonds"
FEA_farmer_funds_desc:0 "We have created a fund to subsidise our primary sector, most importantly our farmers. With a bit of government help, farms and mines are now using the wonders of modern machinery to better extract resources. The popular measure has not only given us greater access to the wealth under our soil, it has also helped shore up political support for the government."
FEA_lightning_warfare:0 "Mobiele-Oorlogsvoering"
FEA_lightning_warfare_desc:0 "Our army has embraced mobile warfare. Bold and as quick as greased lightning, our armed forces will outmanoeuver our foes. If our troops can move quickly, we can pick our battles and beat a larger army."
FEA_car_factories:0 "Entrop Manufacturing"
FEA_car_factories_desc:0 "A massive investment into Entrop Manufacturing has allowed us to set up their new production lines ourselves. Specifically tooled for military vehicles, their plants will churn out the tanks and trucks we will need to succeed in our war of movement."
FEA_lightning_warfare_2:0 "Mobiele-Oorlogsvoering"
FEA_lightning_warfare_2_desc:0 "Our army has mastered mobile warfare. Our tanks move faster than greased lightning, surprising and overpowering our stunned foes. Our officers have learned that our speed will allow them tactical superiority to surround and crush our opposition."
FEA_superior_idea:0 "Overweldigende Vuurkracht"
FEA_superior_idea_desc:0 "We have adopted the doctrine of superior firepower. Our army will focus on shooting as many shells and bullets to the enemy as possible. This will require a greater focus on logistics and tactical use of artillery. When our enemies are blasted into a thousand pieces, victory will merely be a formality."
FEA_artillery_factories:0 "Artillerie-Werken"
FEA_artillery_factories_desc:0 "Our national Artillery-Works will produce the field artillery we need to overpower our foes. A special factory tuned to make the howitzers and field cannons of our expanding arsenal. Arcturius is on the side with the best artillery, after all."
FEA_spec_ops_initiative:0 "Commandotroepen"
FEA_spec_ops_initiative_desc:0 "We have founded the Commandotroops. This special corps trains for extraordinary terrain and weather and with the most exotic of armaments. They are the dagger that compliments the hammer of our artillery."
FEA_superior_idea_2:0 "Overweldigende Vuurkracht"
FEA_superior_idea_2_desc:0 " We have mastered the doctrine of superior firepower. Our army is trained to lob as many shells and bullets to the enemy as possible. Our commanders have honed their focus on logistics and tactical use of artillery. Our enemies will be blasted into a million pieces and victory is inevitable."
FEA_grand_idea:0 "Groot Strijdplan"
FEA_grand_idea_desc:0 "We have opted for the trusty doctrine of the Grand Battleplan. It is easier for us to train a larger army while using the tried and true tactics of the last millennium, but we shouldn't expect miracles. In that regard, we have decided to mostly draft defensive strategies. Let the enemy break themselves on our meticulously crafted battle lines, we will simply lie in wait."
FEA_specialised_staff:0 "Specialised Staff"
FEA_specialised_staff_desc:0 "Now that we have familiarised ourselves with grand strategy, we have a large capable officer corps available for our army. In fact, we can assign extra aides and staff to assist the generals with planning. Four eyes see more than two, this should help further improve our planning."
FEA_grand_idea_2:0 "Groot Strijdplan"
FEA_grand_idea_2_desc:0 " We have mastered the trusty doctrine of the Grand Battleplan. We have been able to train many recruits in the wisdom of the last millennium. We have trained for many strategic defensive positions. The enemy will break on our impenetrably crafted battle lines, all we have to do is wait."
FEA_mass_idea:0 "Massa-Aanval"
FEA_mass_idea_desc:0 "We have made the uncomfortable decision of adapting the Mass Assault doctrine. Our army has faced the reality that we must train every able-bodied Griffon we can find if we are to stand a chance against the enemies that surround us. With streamlined logistics and training ensure that we can match the armies of states with a larger population."
FEA_mass_idea_2:0 "Massa-aanval"
FEA_mass_idea_2_desc:0 " We have adapted to the Mass Assault doctrine. The reality is that every able-bodied Griffon can fight if they must. Our officers are no longer ashamed, but proud of the common soldier and have learned to adapt. With good coordination we merely have to point and a wave of determined soldiers will flood our opponents."
FEA_naval_academy:0 "De Vlootacademie"
FEA_naval_academy_desc:0 "The Fleet Academy was, when the Griffonian Empire still stretched the continent, the pride of Feathisia. Here the most brilliant minds of the age would be turned into captains and admirals. The Academy is now open again and many cadets have signed up to become the core of a new age of Feathisian naval pride."
FEA_great_fleet:0 "De Grote Vloot"
FEA_great_fleet_desc:0 "Feathisian ships now proudly sail the free seas, our flag high in the mast! The Grand Fleet protects our trade lanes with unmatched courage. None of this would be possible, however, without our master shipwrights and designers. A few small details make all the difference, so that our battleships are the most efficient war machines on the big blue ocean."
FEA_naval_air_fleet:0 "Marine Luchtvaart"
FEA_naval_air_fleet_desc:0 "Feathisian carriers are a true marvel of engineering. Our pilots and sailors are both proud to serve on the gargantuan ships. De Marine Luchtvaart, or Naval Aviation branch of our armed forces is turning out to be one of the most popular. We are able to be pickier for recruits who get to pilot our carrier planes and this has made our carriers an even more terrifying foe than they already are."
FEA_beloved_monarch_2:0 "Duke Gerlach the Silent"
FEA_beloved_monarch_2_desc:0 "Grand Duke Gerlach IV Weijermars is known far and wide as one of the most reasonable leaders in Griffonia. The Duke, who earned his nickname 'The Silent' for his patience and calm, transformed his fief into the very first proper Constitutional Monarchy in Griffonia. The people of Feathisia love their Grand Duke and as long as he keeps listening to the concerns of his Griffons, this is unlikely to change"
FEA_aerial_superioriy:0 "Vliegende Luipaarden"
FEA_aerial_superioriy_desc:0 "The Flying Leopards are the best pilots in our air fleet. Every Griffon boy has a poster of them in their room with their signature motto; 'Small in number, large in merit!' By both learning from and excessively advertising the success of the Leopards, they inspire all pilots to be even more bold in their dogfights."
FEA_strat_bombing_ideas:0 "Strategische Vernietiging"
FEA_strat_bombing_ideas_desc:0 "Our bombers are the battleships of the sky. We use them like a fleet, bombarding the enemy below. Our pilots have grown adept at using the large machines to battle even smaller and nimbler fighter planes, while the air force has developed advanced targeting to make sure every bomb hits the target for maximum impact."
FEA_unfunctional_government:0 "Governmental Crisis"
FEA_unfunctional_government_desc:0 "The so called Regency Debate has managed to tear any semblance of order in the Feathisian Parliament to pieces. As long standing grudges, dissatisfaction with the ruling coalition's policies and general dissatisfaction with the government have all finally reached a boiling point. The PvdA has lashed out against the poverty of the working class and while Gerben Kogchel, the leader, is somewhat reasonable, inflammatory comments by Stappenbeld, his communist ally and the Rozenkamp brothers, who are more millitant socialists have enflamed the left. The rightwing has seen the rise of ultranationalist Heeren along with the nationalist leader, Moldernik."
FEA_beloved_monarch_3:0 "Duke Gerlach the Silent"
FEA_beloved_monarch_3_desc:0 "Grand Duke Gerlach IV Weijermars is known far and wide as one of the most reasonable leaders in Griffonia. The Duke, who earned his nickname 'The Silent' for his patience and calm, transformed his fief into the very first proper Constitutional Monarchy in Griffonia. The people of Feathisia love their Grand Duke and as long as he keeps listening to the concerns of his Griffons, this is unlikely to change"
FEA_unfunctional_government_2:0 "Governmental Crisis"
FEA_unfunctional_government_2_desc:0 "The so called Regency Debate has managed to tear any semblance of order in the Feathisian Parliament to pieces. As long standing grudges, dissatisfaction with the ruling coalition's policies and general dissatisfaction with the government have all finally reached a boiling point."
FEA_FHP_PvdA_coalition:0 "FHP-PvdA Coalition"
FEA_FHP_PvdA_coalition_desc:0 "Perhaps by some cosmic accident or through sheer pragmatism the FHP and the PvdA have managed to form a coalition between their two parties"
FEA_LDP_FNV_coalition:0 "LDP-FNV Coalition"
FEA_LDP_FNV_coalition_desc:0 " Perhaps by some cosmic accident or through sheer pragmatism the LDP and the FNV have managed to form a coalition between their two parties"
FEA_proper_welfare:0 "Nationaal Welzijnsprogramma"
FEA_proper_welfare_desc:0 "The National Well-being Program will ensure that every citizen has a minimum of protection. No Griffon shall go hungry or sleep without a roof over their heads. This way we ensure the loyalty and gratitude of the people of Feathisia, who deserve our best efforts."
FEA_youth_group_idea:0 "Jeugdwind"
FEA_youth_group_idea_desc:0 "The Youthwind has been the youth-wing of the FNV for some time. The organisation promotes patriotism and loyalty to the state. With the FNV party in charge, it has been promoted to a government organisation. With increased funding the Jeugdwind can deliver a larger base of recruits for our military."
FEA_revived_nationalism_idea:0 "The Gold and Blue"
FEA_revived_nationalism_idea_desc:0 "The Gold and the Blue are the colours of our national flag. Now, finally after decades of downplaying the value of the nation, nationalism has finally returned to Feathisia. We are born under the Gold and Blue and by Boreas we will die for its honour if we have to."
FEA_feathisia_marches_on_idea:0 "Feathisia Marches On"
FEA_feathisia_marches_on_idea_desc:0 "Government by talk has finally been driven out in favour of a government of action. The new government will make this grand country greater and more prosperous than ever before. We have not abandoned democracy, we are simply carrying out the will of the Feathisians.\n\nA great struggle lies before us against the forces of ruin and despair. But let us all proclaim; Feathisia is not finished. Feathisia is not dead! We will send all the world a message; Feathisia lives and marches on!"
FEA_paramilitary_troops:0 "Arendwachters"
FEA_paramilitary_troops_desc:0 "The Eagle Guards are the paramilitary units of the FNV. They started as an exercise outside the army, trained mostly by veterans who disliked the lack of funding for the proper armed forces. Highly motivated and loyal, the Arendwachters will make a nice addition to the Feathisian Army."
FEA_new_police_force_idea:0 "Korps Nationale Politie"
FEA_new_police_force_idea_desc:0 "The Feathisian Police Force used to be a collection of locally organised forces. That was great for knowing your local officer, but not very efficient. To cope with the challenges of a modern state and the crime it brings with it, the national police force has been organised from the local corps. All miscreants will learn that crime doesn't pay!"
FEA_ducal_guard:0 "Expanded Ducal Guard"
FEA_ducal_guard_desc:0 "The Ducal Guard is an organisation of loyal citizens who follow in the footsteps of Grand Duke Gerlach. All Feathisians who desire to follow this example must be brave, steadfast and have an unwavering devotion to the ideals of Constitutionalism and compromise. Together, these Griffons will guard not only the Grand Duke's life, but also his work and his values."
FEA_free_education:0 "De Leerplicht"
FEA_free_education_desc:0 "Under the mandatory learning act, all Griffon young are now sent to school. There will be no more homeschooling and no more children working in the fields. Now that all Griffons get an education, we are able to share our values and our knowledge. Both are indispensable for a modern state."
FEA_industrial_experts_idea:0 "Skilled Workers"
FEA_industrial_experts_idea_desc:0 "Our decision to make higher education available to more Griffons has led to an influx of skilled engineers and workers. This will mean our factories and construction companies will never have a shortage of experts."
FEA_defense_of_the_homeland:0 "In Defence of the Fatherland"
FEA_defense_of_the_homeland_desc:0 "A nation is measured by the worth of its norms, values and the willingness of her citizens to defend them. Feathisians fight for the values of tolerance and compromise.\nIf we are nationalist, we are nationalist because our nation has the values we share. If we are militarist, that is to defend that which we hold dear. We feel in our hearts and know in our minds that those who fight on the side of the Arcturius' truth and Eyr's justice will triumph over any foe."
FEA_pillarized_system:0 "Verzuiling"
FEA_pillarized_system_desc:0 "A peculiar system of social segregation has arisen in Feathisia. Championed by those who know different ideologies are here to stay, Pillarisation is a system in which all political parties get their own social sphere. These spheres have their own organisations, media and even sports clubs. To make sure the government keeps running, the leaders of all parties cooperate on the highest level.\nIt seems that every Griffon can be satisfied by just allowing them to form their own state within a state. These pillars that run vertically through society may seem strange to an outsider, but to a Feathisian, this seems perfectly normal."
FEA_new_army:0 "Loyal Army"
FEA_new_army_desc:0 "Those who join the Feathisian armed forces know what they are fighting for. They fight for the right to live their own life however they want. They do not deny others the right to do the same as well, even if that may be very different from their own ways. The overarching value is the freedom of choice, championed by the new coalition. That means the National Army can work together, even while every Griffon may have a different goal at home."
FEA_open_door_policy_idea:0 "Opendeurbeleid"
FEA_open_door_policy_idea_desc:0 "Feathisia has opted on an open door policy on immigration. The nation needs workers for her factories, and as such we have decided to not be picky on who occupies those jobs. Some might have concerns over unrestricted immigration, but good old Feathisian tolerance will incorporate these new cultures as well."
FEA_open_to_world_idea:0 "The World's Crossroad"
FEA_open_to_world_idea_desc:0 "Feathisia sits on the crossroad between nations. Trade has always been in our blood as our ships sailed the seas in ages past. We have rekindled that ancient traders' mentality and have become the World's Crossroad once again."
FEA_workshop_of_the_world_idea:0 "Workshop van de Wereld"
FEA_workshop_of_the_world_idea_desc:0 "All peoples of the world have heard of some sort of Feathisian product. Our factories turn to provide all the worlds' free nations with whichever their citizens might require. Feathisians take great pride in their international industry and our traders spread the word of our values far and wide. This in turns has an effect back home, where more Griffons start to stand up for the values we ship all over the world."
FEA_new_army_idea:0 "The New Feathisian Army"
FEA_new_army_idea_desc:0 "The Feathisian Army has always been a strong point for conservatism. Under the new coalition, this has been broken up, however. Young and enthusiastic left-wing Griffons can now more easily join the ranks and fight for our newfound equality."
FEA_socialist_education_idea:0 "Socialistische Opvoeding"
FEA_socialist_education_idea_desc:0 "There is a new wind blowing in our public school, it is the wind of progress! We have streamlined and improved the curriculum. This way all young Griffons will be made into citizens for a new age."
FEA_rising_star_idea:0 "The Rising Star"
FEA_rising_star_idea_desc:0 "In every factory the hymns of socialism are sung. On every field, the farmers now work in unison. In Feathisia we were wise enough to heed the call of a new age and forge a new path of equality. Many things are still left to be done, but all workers hope that Feathisia's rising star will proof that moderate socialism is the way forward to establish paradise on this green planet. The Feathisians can do it together!"
FEA_ruined_economy:0 "Ruined Economy"
FEA_ruined_economy_desc:0 "In spite of efforts to fix it, the brief and bloody Feathisian Civil War has managed to utterly destroy our economy. Again."
FEA_vanguardism_idea:0 "Revolutionaire Voorhoede"
FEA_vanguardism_idea_desc:0 "The theory of communism teaches us that a vanguard of intellectuals, who have grasped the truth about class warfare, must lead the proletariat in the struggle for communism. With the Communist Party fully in charge of the country, the vanguard can finally lead the way into a bright future."
FEA_organized_workers_idea:0 "State Owned, Worker Run"
FEA_organized_workers_idea_desc:0 "In Feathisia, the means of production are owned by the socialist state, to ensure production targets are reached and everything is in order. However, the worker has a chance to have a say on how his or her workplace is run. The goal is set out by the state, but the workers, the true experts of labour, will determine how to meet the goal."
FEA_communist_army_idea:0 "Het Fetisische Rode Leger"
FEA_communist_army_idea_desc:0 "The Feathisian Red Army is the new name of our armed forces. The old duchy is gone and in its place stands the Workers' Republic. The griffons who protect her, conscripts and volunteers both, will be carefully selected and trained. War is the continuation of politics, and such the soldier is a weapon of the revolution. Socialism is worth the sacrifice!"
FEA_communal_farming_idea:0 "Landbouwcommunes"
FEA_communal_farming_idea_desc:0 "We have established Communal farming methods to better distribute the land amongst our farmers. These methods teach the socialist way to the countryside and increase the yield of our agriculture. No stomach will be left empty!"
FEA_communism_with_feathisian_characteristics_idea:0 "A Model Socialist State"
FEA_communism_with_feathisian_characteristics_idea_desc:0 "Socialism has been achieved in Feathisia. The shackles of opression have been broken and a free workers' state has emerged. Under the model socialist state, all shall prosper. There will soon be healthcare, education and jobs for every being in Feathisia!"
FEA_communist_army_idea_2:0 "The Feathisian Republican Army"
FEA_communist_army_idea_2_desc:0 "The Partij van de Arbeid has finalised reforms to the armed forces, creating Het Fetisisch Republikeinse Leger. With the help of veterans from both sides of the civil war, the wages and living conditions of the army have been considerably increased. It is taking some time for those who shot at each other to come to an understanding, but with the radicals from both sides of the conflict gone, no serious incidents have happened as of yet. Many griffons are eager to fight for their newly earned rights in the Republic and morale is high."
FEA_industrialisation_plan:0 "Nationale Industrialisatie-Inspanning"
FEA_industrialisation_plan_desc:0 "The National Industrialisation Effort has been chosen to radically and forcefully increase our production capacities. The Feathisian State must be well armed and well prepared if we are to face the challenges of the future. All citizens will be required to do their part."
FEA_secret_police_idea:0 "Staatspolitie"
FEA_secret_police_idea_desc:0 "The State Police monitors every griffon in Feathisia for any counter-revolutionary behaviour.  Of course all loyal working class Feathisians have nothing to fear and will be recruited to help the Staatspolitie network themselves. Secret policegriffons will also help organise paramilitary units to defend their homes in case of enemy occupation and will work on spreading the network across our borders."
FEA_strasserite_army:0 "De Heerschaar"
FEA_strasserite_army_desc:0 "The new Feathisian Heerschaar, named after an ancient Feathisian word for army, will spread the revolution far and wide. The national-revolutionary spirit runs within the veins of the military and their efforts embolden us. Soon Feathisia's revolution will spread her glory the world over, for who can fight harder than the Feathisian worker?"
FEA_the_new_heartland_ideas:0 "The New Culture"
FEA_the_new_heartland_ideas_desc:0 "A new age has dawned for our country. All art and expression now serves the purpose of the Leider and the revolution. All efforts go towards furthering the goals of Feathisia and defending her. There is no room for the high-arts to doubt our purpose. Culture is only useful insofar it supports the state and soon all other forms of art will be rooted out."
FEA_ruined_economy_1:0 "Ruined Economy"
FEA_ruined_economy_1_desc:0 "In spite of efforts to fix it, the brief and bloody Feathisian Civil War has managed to utterly destroy our economy."
FEA_ruined_economy_2:0 "Ruined Economy"
FEA_ruined_economy_2_desc:0 "In spite of efforts to fix it, the brief and bloody Feathisian Civil War has managed to utterly destroy our economy."
FEA_ruined_economy_3:0 "Ruined Economy"
FEA_ruined_economy_3_desc:0 "In spite of efforts to fix it, the brief and bloody Feathisian Civil War has managed to utterly destroy our economy."
FEA_militarized_society_idea:0 "Feathisian Militarism"
FEA_militarized_society_idea_desc:0 "After the brutal civil war, it was clear that only the military could protect the citizens of Feathisia. Now under the iron claw of the Baron, the Feathisian military has become the cornerstone of government and society. Most citizens are in some way involved with the army, which provides discipline and purpose to the nation. Feathisia is not a nation run by the military, its nation is the military."
FEA_partisan_warfare_idea:0 "Operatie Zwaardval"
FEA_partisan_warfare_idea_desc:0 "It is an outdated idea that war is over when an army has been chased from its homeland. Brave patriots will never give up the fight for noble Feathisia, and we will support them in their endeavour. Secret hierarchies of operatives have been made, along with hidden weapon caches and equipment. If we are ever forced to flee, the secret army will continue the war."
FEA_gestapo:0 "Geheime Staatspolitie"
FEA_gestapo_desc:0 "The Secret State Police is our new secret police service, directly under control of Heeren himself. The secret agents will infiltrate any resistance groups and root them out mercilessly. Feathisia will not tolerate any traitors to live. The G-S will make sure that all citizens who hide any undesirables will also receive a fitting punishment."
FEA_bronze_sentinels:0 "Bronzen Schildwachten"
FEA_bronze_sentinels_desc:0 "The Bronze Sentinels have always supported our leadership. Now that Heeren is finally in power, the Sentinels form their own organisation next to the regular army. Although the regular army units mistrust the Griffons in brown, they are highly motivated and will fight for Heeren and Feathisia until their last breath. They may have some odd rituals, but their dedication is unwavering."
FEA_liberty_through_work_ideas:0 "Industriële-Revalidatie Act"
FEA_liberty_through_work_ideas_desc:0 "Those undesirables who constantly undermine the state will be interned into labour camps. These facilities might be costly, but a regimen of gruelling unforgiving labour and a chronic shortage of food will help the prisoners to become pure. It might be better if we make sure the general public does not know the details about these detention centres, however."
FEA_corporate_allies_2_idea:0 "Corporate Allies"
FEA_corporate_allies_2_idea_desc:0 "Our public works projects and our preparation for war surely have made us some friends in the upper class. Our guarantees to keep their conglomerates together, along with big government contracts, will help us secure the loyalty of the Griffons at the top of the food chain."
FEA_death_squads_idea:0 "Doodseskader"
FEA_death_squads_idea_desc:0 "The best of our Sentinels have joined the death squads. They understand the importance of our cause and are willing to lay down their lives to protect it from internal and external threats. The Sentinels will welcome death like an old friend. They will not try to hide from death, or fight it. For death does not frighten them in the slightest."
FEA_commie_ressistance:0 "The Red Front"

FEA_centrist_agraranism_idea_desc:0 "We have embraced the philosophy of agrarianism. The Griffons who work the earth are as important as the ones who labour in the factories.

Such measures don't come cheap, but they do increase the popularity of the army and ensure new recruits will also be loyal supporters of the FNV."
FEA_workplace_democracy:0 "Workplace Democracy"
FEA_workplace_democracy_desc:0 "Every business with enough workers will be mandated to have an elected workers' council, which will have certain powers over the workplace.

FEA_the_great_experiment_desc:0 "Previously, the supplying of our armed forces was handled via contract work.

FEA_agrarianism:0 "Agrarisme"
FEA_agrarianism_desc:0 "Agricultural has always been a vital part of our economic health, dating back to when our main export was tulips.

FEA_minor_industrial_projects_desc:0 "A growing portion of our population has migrated towards our cities over the past few decades.

FEA_state_unions:0 "Establish the Staatsvakbond"
FEA_state_unions_desc:0 "Prior to the FNV coming to power, Feathisia's unions were numerous, covering a wide range of professions and politics. This created a system where so-called 'unions' were actually run by politically motivated individuals who pilfered from their employees. To fix this corrupt system, the FNV has called for the consolidation of all unions into a single, politically neutral, Staatsvakbond, or state union."
FEA_subsides_farmers:0 "The Farmer-Fonds Program"
FEA_subsides_farmers_desc:0 "The Farmer-Fonds Program calls for the establishment of a state bank which will provide low-interest loans to our farmers, helping them acquire the assets needed to grow and modernise their estates.

FEA_mobile_2:0 "Motorised Units"
FEA_mobile_2_desc:0 "Using trucks as transport is an idea that is not unknown, it's what they were made for after all. Having dedicated vehicles for some of our divisions, which they can use in manoeuvers, will help us to quickly secure the ground the pantsers will conquer. To make sure these units are effective, however, we will need to also develop modern small-arms."
FEA_mobile_3:0 "Invest Into Entrop Manufacturing"
FEA_mobile_3_desc:0 "Entrop Manufacturing is one of Feathisia's premier manufacturing plants, and was one of the first manufacturers of automobiles in Feathisia.

FEA_mobile_4:0 "Light Pantser Models"
FEA_mobile_4_desc:0 "The Pantser, or tank, is the perfect fit for our mobile doctrine. It combines speed and firepower for a quick victory. If we are to win the war of movement, developing pantsers will be key."
FEA_mobile_5:0 "Medium Pantser Models"
FEA_mobile_5_desc:0 "Heavier armoured than the light tank and still fairly easy to produce, the medium pantser is the logical next step in armour development. This versatile machine, if led by competent commanders, could turn out to be the king of the modern battlefield."

FEA_mobile_6_desc:0 "With our doctrine solidified and our officers trained, it's time to enhance it with further study and trials. We have promoted the most daring and brazen officers to lead the charge. Initiative and aggressiveness will be the watchwords of our armoured corps!"
FEA_superior_1:0 "Overweldigende Vuurkracht Doctrine"
FEA_superior_1_desc:0 "Some have argued that warfare is not a difficult field of study. It is merely logistics and numbers. If you outgun the enemy and most efficiently pack firepower in a small area, you are sure to win. Let us embrace the doctrine of Overwhelming Firepower."
FEA_superior_2:0 "Modern Infantry Equipment"
FEA_superior_2_desc:0 "The first step to fire superiority lies in designing new guns, both big and small. Mortars, machine guns, howitzers and cannons are all needed if we are to outshoot the enemy, rather than outnumber them. Several designs have been drawn up to get our arsenal up to modern standards."
FEA_superior_3:0 "Establish the Artillerie-Werken"
FEA_superior_3_desc:0 "To build all the new artillery we need, Feathisia must establish a new factory. We have chosen a suitable site in Luxwingburg for a dedicated artillery factory. The Artillerie-Werken will pump out the guns and the shells we need to blast a way through any foe."

FEA_superior_4_desc:0 "Special Forces are the masters of gaining local fire superiority.

We may not have the largest army, but Feathisia might just have the best commando troops."
FEA_superior_5:0 "Experimental Weaponry"
FEA_superior_5_desc:0 "Regular weapons are only part of the playing field, especially in Equestria. Although Feathisia lacks the crystals to easily manufacture magical weapons, it will still be a worthwhile investment to research them. Magical weapons provide an added punch which will only help our Firepower doctrine."
FEA_superior_6:0 "Perfect the Overweldigende Vuurkracht Doctrine"
FEA_superior_6_desc:0 "Even though our doctrine is quite straightforward, it is hard to perfect. Many logistical operations to get ammunition at the right place and quickly building and deconstructing artillery emplacements are but two of the challenges we face if we are to master the art of destruction."
FEA_grand_1:0 "Groot Strijdplan Doctrine"
FEA_grand_1_desc:0 "The more senior thinkers amongst the army have theorised that our country would benefit most from a defensive posture. By encompassing our country and all our forces in one grand battle plan, we will be able to predict any enemy assault and take effective countermeasures."
FEA_grand_2:0 "Guns for the Troops"
FEA_grand_2_desc:0 "We have identified a lack of modern firearms amongst our soldiers, some have to even use wooden replicas during training.

FEA_grand_3:0 "Modern Artillery"
FEA_grand_3_desc:0 "When Grover conquered most of the continent, he did so with a grand battery of artillery. Nothing much has changed since then and Boreas is still on the side with the best artillery. Our general staff, understandably, has urged the cabinet to make sure we have the best artillery."
FEA_grand_4:0 "Dedicated Support Squads"
FEA_grand_4_desc:0 "To improve the combat effectiveness of our divisions, we need to include dedicated support squads. These will make entrenchments or scout for the main force. Having specialised troops for this purpose will help our army to overcome even the most difficult terrain one may encounter in Griffonia."
FEA_grand_5:0 "Specialised Staff"
FEA_grand_5_desc:0 "Our officers and staff members need to be trained to support their superiors in planning and preparing our battles. A general does not work on his own and the entire staff is a team, from the aide de camp to the communications officer."
FEA_grand_6:0 "Perfect the Groot Strijdplan Doctrine"
FEA_grand_6_desc:0 "Our most patient, calm officers have been promoted to be in line with our doctrine. Our troops have been instructed on defensive tactics and our army is prepared for the coming conflict. All that is left is to drill, drill, drill!"
FEA_mass_1:0 "Massa-Aanval Doctrine"
FEA_mass_1_desc:0 "The ugly truth is that with our current conscription and admission laws, the Feathisian army is dangerously small. Our professional troops may not like this, but a rapid increase in the size of the armed forces might be the only way that Feathisia can stay alive."
FEA_mass_2:0 "Guns For Days"
FEA_mass_2_desc:0 "It is imperative that we get a rifle for all our new soldiers. Museums or other countries. It doesn't matter where we find them, as long as we equip our troops. If we have some money left after all these purchases, then maybe we can also put some thought into upgrading our small arms."
FEA_mass_3:0 "Lots of Cannons"
FEA_mass_3_desc:0 "Simply put, our army will need lots of cannons. To protect our common soldiers at least a little bit, we need to be able to field more artillery than the opponent. Luckily we have found a discount offer on the global market to get some decent howitzers on the cheap."
FEA_mass_4:0 "A Shovel For Every Soldier"
FEA_mass_4_desc:0 "All that griffonpower is going to waste if our soldiers are not fighting. If we give our soldiers more shovels, they can at least dig some trenches while they aren't charging the enemy."
FEA_mass_5:0 "Streamlined Production"
FEA_mass_5_desc:0 "The Feathisian army can easily do more with less. Testing and safety procedures for firearms are all well and good in peacetime, but we need to ramp up our production now. By cutting red tape and unnecessary fancy parts of our production process, we effectively gain more factories."
FEA_mass_6:0 "Perfect the Massa-Aanval Doctrine"
FEA_mass_6_desc:0 "Our officers are finally getting used to the increased workload of commanding all these new soldiers. The Feathisian army may not be the most elite, prestigious fighting force it once was, but at least our front line is filled with hardy griffons who are willing to give their all for the fatherland."
FEA_military_science:0 "Military Science"
FEA_military_science_desc:0 "Our army has been pushed out of the last millennium by some thorough reforms. Military theorists and thinkers have been swept up in the excitement of change. We finally have enough daring thinkers so that military research can help our nation forward as much as the civilian universities."
FEA_racial_theory:0 "Hidden Potential"
FEA_racial_theory_desc:0 "Worldwide, griffons aren't known for their magic, but that does not mean we don't have it. Our abilities may not be as flashy as those of unicorns, but our knights and enchanters can definitely be a great help, even in the modern age. We should apply funding to research more practical applications for our hidden potentials."
FEA_magical_weapons:0 "Magical Weaponry Experiments"
FEA_magical_weapons_desc:0 "Lately, more and more nations have switched to magic weapons. We should experiment with the crystal-fuelled rifles as well. If we are able to outfit some of our units with those guns, our army will be even deadlier."
FEA_code_language:0 "Develop a Code Language"
FEA_code_language_desc:0 "Although the nobles in Griffenheim joke that Feathisian is already incomprehensible, we still need to make an actual code language to protect our military secrets from any espionage. It will be quite the task to make sure all officers know its codes and protocols without revealing that information to any prying eyes.    "
FEA_radar_project:0 "RADAR Experiments"
FEA_radar_project_desc:0 "The RADAR helps detect foes, especially aircraft, from afar. Using radio waves, these emplacements can help increase our battlefield control. A few of those towers in the correct places could make Feathisian airspace that much safer."

FEA_navy_stuff:0 "Re-Open the Vlootacademie"
FEA_navy_stuff_desc:0 "The Fleet Academy was once the pride of Feathisia and if we are to sail the seas once more, we will have to re-open the academy and train a new generation of naval officers. These new cadets will ensure that Feathisia is a name to be feared on the oceans!"
FEA_being_1:0 "A Surface Fleet"
FEA_being_1_desc:0 "To properly project our power across the seas and into territories of vital interest, we have to build a prestigious and seaworthy surface fleet. We will show the world that Feathisian ships are still the finest that sail the ocean!"
FEA_being_2:0 "Advanced Battleship Models"
FEA_being_2_desc:0 "Although modern ships are built out of steel instead of wood nowadays, the basic principle remains the same. More, higher calibre cannons on resilient and robust ships will win the day. We must challenge our designers to build more modern and more heavily armed battleships."
FEA_being_3:0 "Expand the Rottendedam Naval Base"
FEA_being_3_desc:0 "Rottendedam's port is great for trading, but simply not large enough to house our expanding fleet. We must expand the ports and the dockyards so that even the most modern vessels can be constructed there. One day, we shall out-build even Skyfall itself!"
FEA_being_4:0 "Destroyer Effort"
FEA_being_4_desc:0 "Battleships can simply not be made in large enough numbers to protect all our trade routes. Besides, even when we can bring them to bear upon the enemy, smaller screen ships will help to protect the big ships against attacks from submarines. We are certain a big push can bring our destroyers up to modern standards."
FEA_being_5:0 "Cruiser Effort"
FEA_being_5_desc:0 "To complete our surface fleet, we will need Cruisers, a class in between battleships and screens. We can choose to invest in light cruisers, which can operate as more long range screens, or heavy cruisers, which are almost capital-ship level. The admiralty has yet to make a final decision."
FEA_being_6:0 "De Grote Vloot"
FEA_being_6_desc:0 "Now that the designs have been made and the first prototypes are slipping from the dockyards, we will make our dream a reality. The pride of our sailors and the design of our ships are unmatched in Griffonia. The Grand Fleet of Feathisia will set sail!"
FEA_strike_1:0 "Naval Aviation"
FEA_strike_1_desc:0 "Modern times have brought us the aircraft. We can focus our fleet on ships that house these craft and destroy the enemy from a range farther than the biggest gun can reach. If our fleet is to be the strongest, we will have to build it around these aircraft carriers."
FEA_strike_2:0 "Destroyer Fleet"
FEA_strike_2_desc:0 "Our carriers are hard to manoeuver and carry few armaments. In the event of an enemy fleet getting close, we will need to have screen ships to keep them at bay. Destroyers are relatively easy to build and an excellent choice for this role.  "
FEA_strike_3:0 "O-Boat Experiments"
FEA_strike_3_desc:0 "The submarine was a Feathisian invention that was mostly used for novelty and leisure. However, many nations have seen the potential of arming such ships to sneak up on trade convoys and even military ships. We mustn't lag behind and make sure our O-boat models are as effective as theirs."
FEA_strike_4:0 "Improved Carrier Models"
FEA_strike_4_desc:0 "The Aircraft Carrier will be the centre of our fleet. Therefore, we must invest all our efforts in having our design be revolutionary. It costs a lot of funds and time to make one of these ships, so we have to ensure we get it right, or risk scuppering the entire project."
FEA_strike_5:0 "Rottendedam Airbase"
FEA_strike_5_desc:0 "To train all our carrier pilots and to house ground based aircraft to support our fleet in coastal operations, Rottendedam Airbase has to be expanded. New runways and hangars will have to be constructed and ground personnel will have to be attracted. With this project, we will safeguard the aerial capacity of both our fleet and our normal air force."
FEA_strike_6:0 "Marine Luchtvaart"
FEA_strike_6_desc:0 "We have completed our fleet plans based around naval aviation. With our aircraft carriers, the Feathisian navy will be a force to be reckoned with once more. What is left is to give our pilots special naval aviation training, so that they will be one cut above the rest."
FEA_further_expansion:0 "Expand the Rottendedam Dockyards"
FEA_further_expansion_desc:0 "The doctrines have been written and the manuals distributed. The ship designs drawn up and the sailors mustered. All that is left is to actually build the ships of our navy. We will expand the Rottendedam harbour by recovering new land from the sea, so that there will be room for more dockyards."
FEA_transport:0 "Experimental Landing Craft"
FEA_transport_desc:0 "Now that our fleet is up to shape, we can start thinking one step further. Once we have wrestled control of the sea from our enemies, we will need to take over their naval bases as well. For this new assault craft will have to be made."
FEA_marines:0 "Form the FMC"
FEA_marines_desc:0 "Especially hardy griffons will be able to enlist in a new part of the armed forces, the Fetisische Marine Corps. This unit will be based under our fleet and fight the toughest battles, both to cross rivers and to attack from the sea. 'As far as the world goes!'"

FEA_air_stuff:0 "Construct New Airbases"
FEA_air_stuff_desc:0 "It has come to our attention that griffon knights are no longer the most dangerous creatures in the skies. Airplanes outfitted with bombs and machine guns are a new threat on the modern battlefields. Before we ourselves can even dream of building a modern air force like that, Feathisia will need to build new airfields to train and house our pilots and planes."
FEA_air_superior_1:0 "Air Superiority Doctrine"
FEA_air_superior_1_desc:0 "To protect our homes from bombers and to safeguard our troops on the battlefield, we must make sure we have air superiority. If the air force can keep the skies clean of enemies, our army will surely be able to win the fight. Therefore, we shall instruct our theorists to develop fighter tactics."
FEA_air_superior_2:0 "Beakker D.XXI"
FEA_air_superior_2_desc:0 "Beakker, a Feathisian company that has been producing planes for many Griffonian states, has proposed several fighter models for the modern age. Chief among these is the D.XXI, with a top speed of 460 kilometers per hour. Carrying 4 machine guns, this fighter could well become the mainstay of our fledgling air force."
FEA_air_superior_3:0 "Beakker G.I"
FEA_air_superior_3_desc:0 "Another plan from Beakker is the G.I or the 'Jachtkruiser'. This massive fighter aircraft with heavy armaments is aptly named after cruiser ships. It will easily destroy flimsy lighter fighters. We only have to purchase the design, custom made for the Feathisian Airforce."
FEA_air_superior_4:0 "Beakker C.X"
FEA_air_superior_4_desc:0 "The Beakker C.X is a light, nimble craft, ideally suited for battlefield support tactics. Beakker initially made is as a recon craft for hard to reach areas as jungles. Although the planes are lightly armed, they pack a punch of nasty bombs to destroy armour."
FEA_air_superior_5:0 "Expand the Airbases"
FEA_air_superior_5_desc:0 "Most of our hangars were made for larger passenger planes. We simply need more airstrips and hangars to house the amount of fighters we are planning to construct. Several plots of land need to be given a new Land-Use plan to accommodate our growing airfields."
FEA_air_superior_6:0 "Vliegende Luipaarden"
FEA_air_superior_6_desc:0 "The best squadron of our air force is called the Flying Leopards. Our relations department has suggested we market this name to the younger generation, to get them interested in military aviation. Telling of the heroism of our best pilots should give the rest the aspiration to push their limits as well."
FEA_air_bombing_1:0 "Strategic Destruction Doctrine"
FEA_air_bombing_1_desc:0 "We simply must neutralise the enemy's production capabilities. Large, robust planes can reach deep behind the frontline and hit our foes at home. By planning for a campaign of strategic destruction, we will starve the enemy of the resources they require to wage war on us."
FEA_air_bombing_2:0 "Gerlach 139"
FEA_air_bombing_2_desc:0 "The 139 model, named after the Archduke, was supposed to be a passenger liner at first. However, when Beakker heard of our attempts to procure bomber aircraft, they quickly redesigned it into a long range bomber craft. We just need to convince the duke that it's okay to have his name on a plane."
FEA_air_bombing_3:0 "Beakker T.IX"
FEA_air_bombing_3_desc:0 "Beakker has developed a smaller bomber model for medium range missions. The model is apparently quite versatile and can accomplish both close air support and strategic missions. The first test flight of the prototype was impressive, with the craft almost running silent due to special regulator screws. We should get our claws on the design!"
FEA_air_bombing_4:0 "Beakker D.XC"
FEA_air_bombing_4_desc:0 "We need a heavier escort plane for our bombers, and of course Beakker has just the model we need. A triple-engine fighter plane that can outrange pretty much every single-engine fighter. The company boasts it could easily fly all the way to Equestria from Rottendedam. We haven't put that to the test yet, but the specifics of the craft look impressive."
FEA_air_bombing_5:0 "Beakker T.V"
FEA_air_bombing_5_desc:0 "To complement our bomber models, Beakker has made a heavy close air support craft. Armed to the teeth with machine guns and able to carry a ton of bombs, the T.V should massacre any ground forces that it catches. Beakker has warned us that rubber safety-coating around the fueltanks isn't standard in the design and that we probably should include it if the pilots don't want to be set ablaze by tracer rounds."
FEA_air_bombing_6:0 "Strategische Vernietiging"
FEA_air_bombing_6_desc:0 "Now that we have all the designs and aircraft we need, our air force can focus on perfecting the targeting of the enemy's strategic assets. If we improve our targeting, it will mean a higher percentage of bombs actually hit the target, effectively meaning that fewer aircraft can achieve the same goals."
FEA_airbase_expansion:0 "Expand the Airfields"
FEA_airbase_expansion_desc:0 "Our largest airfields are yet again in need of a major expansion. It will take some time to convince the populace that the extra noise from the overflying planes is a necessity. We probably have to compensate some of them, even, lest they start a protest group or even worse, an action committee."
FEA_rocket_project:0 "V-2 Rockets"
FEA_rocket_project_desc:0 "Beakker and his designers may have been busy with pioneering new aircraft designs, but an even more advanced form of aerial warfare is developing in parallel. The Versie-1 raket was merely a prototype, but the Versie-2 looks like it could actually do strategic damage to enemies, without risking the life of a pilot."
FEA_paratroopers:0 "Parachutistenbrigade"
FEA_paratroopers_desc:0 "Now that we have wrestled control from the skies, we could also drop something other than bombs back to the ground. It has been proposed that we make a special parachute brigade to glide down to the enemy. Several troops have complained that they can already fly and that a parachute would just slow down their descent and make them easy targets. Their complaints have been noted down for future reference."

FEA_government_problems:0 "Crisis in the Coalition"
FEA_government_problems_desc:0 "The coalition been plagued by instability for a while now, but recently it has been struck by complete disaster. Distrust within various factions of the coalition, both between each other and with the government in general have caused a total collapse of the coalition, and now there is no telling what the future will hold for Feathisia."
FEA_governmental_reorganization:0 "Initial Stabilisation"
FEA_governmental_reorganization_desc:0 "If we are to do anything to recover from this disaster, we must first stabilise the nation and return faith to the government."
FEA_left_parties:0 "Look to the Left"
FEA_left_parties_desc:0 "If we are to unite the griffons of Feathisia, we cannot be close-minded. We must turn to the working class and everygriffon of the nation."
FEA_common_ground_lefties:0 "Common Ground"
FEA_common_ground_lefties_desc:0 "Despite what some radicals claim, the nobility do care for the griffons of Feathisia. Much of the FHP as well as a surprising number of the moderates in the PvdA have come together, uniting behind a common cry- "A party for the Griffons!". This has caused conflict with the more radical socialists in the Labour party, but many members of both parties are just relieved that they will be a part of the new power bloc."
FEA_weird_fucking_coalition:0 "The FHP-PvdA Coalition"
FEA_weird_fucking_coalition_desc:0 "The formation of a coalition between the FHP and PvdA has been formalised, bringing together the two formerly desperate parties. They have attained a majority, and it seems like this new, strange coalition will be in control of the government for the time being."
FEA_the_PvdA:0 "The PvdA"
FEA_the_PvdA_desc:0 "The Partij Van De Arbeid is the premier socialist party in Feathisia. It supports further rights for the workers and unions and is broadly supported by a good portion of the proletariat, particularly in urban areas."
FEA_attract_LDP_members:0 "Attract LDP Members"

FEA_right_parties:0 "Look to the Right"
FEA_right_parties_desc:0 "We must have a strong unifying party to rally behind, if we are to keep the nation stable in the future. Either the old landed nobility or the nationalists can help bring back the rule of law to our nation."
FEA_the_FHP:0 "The FHP"
FEA_the_FHP_desc:0 "The Fethisische Hertogelijke Partij represents the interests of nobles, royalists and aristocrats. It wants to continue the old ways and support the rights of the upper class. Many support this party even without directly benefiting, as it promises a return to a stable and moderate government."
FEA_common_ground:0 "Common Interests"
FEA_common_ground_desc:0 "The FNV and LDP might be radically opposed on almost every account, but if Feathisia is to get through these trying times, compromises must be made. The gap between the beliefs of the two parties has been growing smaller, with more radical nationalists tapering off, and with more and more members of the LDP growing less adamant in their beliefs. Perhaps these two groups may unite, for the sake of the country?"
FEA_another_weird_coalition:0 "The LDP-FNV Coalition"
FEA_another_weird_coalition_desc:0 "The LDP and FNV have formally announced the creation of a coalition, encompassing both parties. While it doesn't appease the radicals of either side, it has managed to swing many members into supporting its creation. Many simply sigh in relief that the crisis is coming to an end, and a new government is being formed."
FEA_the_FNV:0 "The FNV"
FEA_the_FNV_desc:0 "The Fetisisch Nationalistisch Verbond is a group encompassing nationalist elements of the nation, united behind the ideas of a strong and prosperous nation. While it has been criticised by some liberals for its plans to restrict freedom and very negative attitudes towards minorities, the idea of a unified nation can appeal to almost any griffon in such chaotic times such as these."
FEA_attract_FHP_members:0 "Attract Members of the FHP"
FEA_attract_FHP_members_desc:0 "The FHP has lost much of its power after the collapse of the coalition, and many of the members who once turned to it for stability have grown nervous. By focusing our efforts on swinging them to our side, with promises of peace and a unified government, we can gain more supporters for our cause."
FEA_reconciliation_effort:0 "Reconciliation Efforts"
FEA_reconciliation_effort_desc:0 "During the crisis, many griffons who may have been moderate were radicalised, believing there was no hope for the old system. However, we have proven to be able to stand up to this test, and as such we may be able to swing such elements back into favouring us, if we are to reassure them of our stability."
FEA_against_extremism:0 "Fight Against Extremism"
FEA_against_extremism_desc:0 "Extremists on the left and right are taking to the streets, criticising the old ways and practically revolting from our rule. We must put an end to the most radical elements of the nationalist and labour parties, or else the stability of our nation and government may be at stake."
FEA_appeal_to_moderates:0 "Appeal to the Moderates"
FEA_appeal_to_moderates_desc:0 "Many griffons in the FNV and PvdA do not fully agree with the most radical interpretations of their parties, simply wishing for more rights or a stronger government. We can easily turn these griffons to our side by appealing to their interests, and emphasising the uglier aspects of their own parties."
FEA_the_dukes_trust:0 "Earn the Duke's Trust... Again"
FEA_the_dukes_trust_desc:0 "The crisis did nothing to help the once supportive duke's views of our coalition, and now he is distrustful of the instability caused in the past. If we're to continue in restoring the old ways, we must gain back his trust in our system."

FEA_new_parliament:0 "Parliamentary Dealings"
FEA_new_parliament_desc:0 "With the collapse of the old parliament, we have no opposition to our creation of a more loyal cabinet. We can pick up the pieces of the old system and tie them together to support our party, made up of representatives of the workers and other loyal party members."
FEA_sideline_rozenkamp_brothers:0 "Sideline Rozenkamp"
FEA_sideline_rozenkamp_brothers_desc:0 "Herman Rozenkamp has lead the most unconventional and radical part of the PvdA. He has proposed a sort of nationalist workers state. His views have no place in the party anymore and if our coalition partner is to see us as genuine, we have to oust Rozenkamp."
FEA_work_with_others:0 "Break Bread"
FEA_work_with_others_desc:0 "Our rise to power has caused a stir within the rest of the nation.

FEA_social_revolution:0 "The Social Revolution"
FEA_social_revolution_desc:0 "Of course, a communist revolution changes the very fabric of society.

FEA_worker_self_managment_desc:0 "It is the state that owns the means of production, to safeguard the people against capitalism and against shortages on the shelves. However, the griffons and ponies that work the factories should manage their own affairs. They are the experts of their trade, not us. We will cut out needless managers and let the workers run their own workplace."
FEA_feathisian_communism:0 "The Model Socialist State"
FEA_feathisian_communism_desc:0 "Caramel Marks and Steel Stallion must salute us from beyond the veil of death, for socialism has been achieved in Feathisia!

FEA_kogchel_socialists_desc:0 "Together, we have endured much hardship, but the one thing undamaged are Feathisia's dreams for the future.

FEA_industrial_democracy:0 "Workplace Democracy"
FEA_industrial_democracy_desc:0 "Every worker will have a say in the affairs surrounding their workplace. Every workplace with more than twenty workers will have an elected council, which will endeavour to improve working conditions.

FEA_encourage_unionism:0 "Enshrine Unionism"
FEA_encourage_unionism_desc:0 "Solidarity is the bedrock of any successful society and we must work together if we want to achieve our dreams. Therefore, every working being should consider joining their union, to fight for the rights of all of their colleagues.

FEA_construction_f_desc:0 "Work is not just the means to survival. In our society, it is also an important part in building up self-worth and self-realisation.

FEA_new_workplaces:0 "The Cooperative Model"
FEA_new_workplaces_desc:0 "It is time to experiment with new forms of business. We will grant funding for workplaces owned and run by every member in a cooperative venture.

FEA_army_unions:0 "Rehabilitate The Army"
FEA_army_unions_desc:0 "Many veterans of the civil war are now pushed to the edge of society, afraid of our regime. The old soldiers of the Feathisian Army, many of who had to make a split-second decision to follow orders or to desert, are still afraid of reprisals for the past. We will not be vengeful, but offer amnesty to those soldiers who were not radical and who can help us rebuild our army to her former size."
FEA_direct_democracy:0 "Nieuwe Democratie"
FEA_direct_democracy_desc:0 "In an overhaul of the old Feathisian constitution titled 'New Democracy', Gerben Kogchel has outlined the social character of the Republic.

FEA_education_reforms_kog:0 "Socialistische Opvoeding"
FEA_education_reforms_kog_desc:0 "It is time for a big investment in our education system. New books will have to be written and new teachers will have to be found.

FEA_the_healthcare_plan:0 "The Algemeen Ziekenfonds"
FEA_the_healthcare_plan_desc:0 "Healthcare is not free, but that does not make it less essential. The government will make a fund for healthcare expenses.

FEA_support_middle_class:0 "Support The Middle Class"
FEA_support_middle_class_desc:0 "Socialism is not just the ideology of the poorest, but for all those who work hard to make Feathisia a better place.

FEA_rozenkamp_strasserists_desc:0 "The Rozenkamp brothers have fought hard during the civil war, sometimes using tactics and concepts that seemed to belong more to our enemies. But they have earned the respect of the common soldier and worker by telling them that the revolution is not the end of the nation they so love. Now Herman Rozenkamp will become the leader of Feathisia, to prepare us for the coming struggle."
FEA_state_controlled_economy:0 "Seize the Market"
FEA_state_controlled_economy_desc:0 "No more will we toil for the benefit of a foreigner. No more will Feathisian grain and Feathisian product enrich the capitalist class. Feathisia will take what is hers and provide for her children, the working griffons. A plan to rapidly nationalise the private sector and to severely curb our exports will show that we are serious about helping the poorest of society. "
FEA_full_economic_mobilisation:0 "Retool the Industrial Sector"
FEA_full_economic_mobilisation_desc:0 "Jealous and frightened eyes look to Feathisia, seeking to take our wealth for themselves. We must reorganise our industry to produce weapons of war, to defend ourselves against capitalist and feudal aggression. Reinoud has made an ambitious plan to  build two new makeshift factories and to introduce strict measures to civilian industry."
FEA_increase_spending:0 "Nationale Industrialisatie-Inspanning"
FEA_increase_spending_desc:0 "All must work for the Leider! All must work for the final victory, the destiny of the Feathisian proletariat!

No griffon will be able to outmatch us in the factory-front."
FEA_establish_the_SA:0 "Establish The Staatspolitie"
FEA_establish_the_SA_desc:0 "We cannot be too careful about treason. Ponies, capitalists and nobles still conspire to bring down the National Revolution.

FEA_reform_the_army:0 "The Birth of De Heerschaar"
FEA_reform_the_army_desc:0 "The Feathisian Army has been used to indoctrinate the working class against the revolution for decades, maybe even centuries.

FEA_purge_rivals:0 "Enforce Ideological Purity"
FEA_purge_rivals_desc:0 "Many griffons are still sceptical about the need of such drastic measures like ours. They are afraid they will lose their 'rights'. But rights are only privileges as long as the working class is not liberated. We must ensure that every griffon understands that Rozenkampism is our ideology now. Disobeying the Leider will not be tolerated."
FEA_welfare_for_griffons:0 "Welfare For The Griffon"
FEA_welfare_for_griffons_desc:0 "Feathisia is wealthy and through the Griffking flows a nigh-endless stream of wealth. Now that the capitalists have been dealt with, we can provide for every working griffon. No longer will illness or a death in the family lead to hunger. No griffon will be denied a doctor or schooling. Feathisia, our homeland, will provide for her workers."
FEA_bullet_for_ponies:0 "A Bullet for the Pony"
FEA_bullet_for_ponies_desc:0 "The ponies have brought Feathisia nothing but poverty. They have stolen jobs and send their wealth back to their homeland.

FEA_cultural_rebirth:0 "The Cultural Rebirth"
FEA_cultural_rebirth_desc:0 "Feathisia's culture has long been oppressed by the so called 'elite'. The people's art and traditions can now be laid out, under careful guidance of the Leider. Art, music and theatre are a tool of the revolution, so they must be put to good use. We must destroy all artistic references that doubt our purpose, if we want to protect the revolution against treason."
FEA_dreams_of_empire:0 "Strike our Mortal Enemy"
FEA_dreams_of_empire_desc:0 "The Archons and nobles of Griffenheim have done nothing but leech off of the Feathisian worker.

FEA_militarise_society:0 "Revive Our Martial Tradition"
FEA_militarise_society_desc:0 "Feathisia has a long and noble martial tradition, which was almost forgotten after decades of unrest abroad and complacency at home.

FEA_retool_the_industrial_sector_desc:0 "We are woefully unprepared to equip all the new soldiers required to safeguard the nation, while the civilian economy drains Feathisia's precious resources.

FEA_always_ready:0 "Operatie Zwaardval"
FEA_always_ready_desc:0 "In case part or all of the homeland comes under enemy control, we must be able to continue the war. Jonkheer Karel Everhard, part of the ducal family, has come up with a plan of hidden weapon caches, student militias and saboteurs to wage partisan warfare.

FEA_enshrine_monarchism_desc:0 "Where was the FHP when our country was under threat from Godsless communists? Where were the liberals with their lofty ideals when our Grand Duke was shot?

FEA_destroy_communism:0 "The Stab in the Back"
FEA_destroy_communism_desc:0 "When our Grand Duke, ever gentle, was murdered, the communists seized the opportunity to openly revolt against our beautiful nation. The reds who once claimed to respect our national institutions quickly turned against them when they smelled the possibility for revolution. We defended Feathisia from a ghastly fate, but many socialists still linger in our midst. This must be rectified."
FEA_suspend_voting_rights:0 "Suspend Voting Rights"
FEA_suspend_voting_rights_desc:0 "It is regrettable that our democratic institutions cannot continue to function under the strain of these grim times. We find our nation facing a real chance of war in the near future.

FEA_introduce_state_unions:0 "Establish The Staatsvakbond"
FEA_introduce_state_unions_desc:0 "Many communists see labour unions as a vehicle for their ideology, as workers seeking better conditions supposedly have the same interests as these lying thieves. By establishing a state union, we can retain the advantage of collective bargaining towards unscrupulous capitalists, while allowing us to steer union politics and demands when necessary."
FEA_seize_loyalist_assets:0 "Pass the Verbeurings Act"
FEA_seize_loyalist_assets_desc:0 "Under the slogan, Verraad is Verbeuring, Treason is Forfeiting, and we will pass a law to seize assets from those who collaborated with the socialist rebels. Some companies, mainly owned by liberal democratic businessgriffs, chose to back Kogchel over us. Some others did not, but their factories are important to the national interest. Feathisia will take what she needs."
FEA_worker_brigades:0 "Establish The Arbeidersbataljons"
FEA_worker_brigades_desc:0 "We have a lack of claws to construct vital civilian and military infrastructure, and a lot of unemployed griffons due to the miserable state of the post-civil war economy.

FEA_protect_the_markets:0 "Protectionism"
FEA_protect_the_markets_desc:0 "Feathisia, being the most civilised nation on our planet, already produces everything it needs.

The government will henceforth task itself with protecting the economy."
FEA_kill_off_heeren:0 "Dispose Of Heeren"
FEA_kill_off_heeren_desc:0 "Godfried Heeren sealed the fate of thousands of griffons, soldiers, civilians and even children, when he deliberately blew up my attempts to negotiate with Kogchel.

FEA_restore_democratic_institutions_desc:0 "The crisis is over and with the red threat properly dealt with, along with the end to extremism on our side, we can finally return to the business of the day. The thing the supporters of petty dictators don't understand, is that suppressing democracy is a sign of weakness, not of strength. I will trust the judgement of the Feathisian people, for I have done the right thing."
FEA_rebuild_the_army:0 "Restructure The Army"
FEA_rebuild_the_army_desc:0 "The military is not just a fighting force, but also a political tool, after all, war is the continuation of politics. This is not just true for foreign policy either, our party can benefit immensely. We will slowly merge our party and the army and increase our propaganda efforts for the armed forces. This will gain us more supporters and them more recruits."
FEA_youth_league:0 "The Jeugdwind"
FEA_youth_league_desc:0 "The Jeugdwind is the youth organisation of the FNV. It and the Feathisian Scout organisation have competed for numbers for years, but it is time to merge the two organisations and increase cooperation with the army cadet program. Having children learn self-defence and patriotism at a young age will prepare them for a career in the army."
FEA_feathisian_welfare:0 "The Nationaal Welzijnsprogramma"
FEA_feathisian_welfare_desc:0 "No Feathisian shall go hungry or sleep on the street, for the worth of a nation lies not in the splendour of the richest griffon, but the welfare for the poor.

FEA_help_the_farmers_desc:0 "The humble farmer is the backbone of every nation, providing the food that we all eat.

FEA_great_purge:0 "The Great Purge"
FEA_great_purge_desc:0 "We must sow fear into the hearts of our population. Fear and anger. On principle, many Feathisians disagree with our methods, but we will have to make our enemies appear worse. Communism, spread by pony infiltrators, is threatening to destroy Feathisia and take away the common griffon's job, and home and life. Only drastic measures can keep us safe. Only Heeren can keep us safe."
FEA_decry_monarchism:0 "Why Bleed for Grover?"
FEA_decry_monarchism_desc:0 "The Grover dynasty and the Weijermars family have done nothing but take and take from Feathisia. The Imperials had us bleed for them for centuries while we gained nothing! The Grand Dukes of Feathisia let this happen out of a misplaced sense of loyalty.

FEA_reorganize_wardens_desc:0 "The Bronze Sentinels have been Heeren's most loyal supporters. Fanatically nationalistic, these militias pledged their lives to protect their leader. It is time that the Sentinels are properly integrated into the armed forces, to provide an example to the other soldiers and the Feathisian youth. There is but one lesson: No sacrifice is too great to protect the soul of our ancient nation! "
FEA_secret_police_fascist:0 "Establish The Geheime Staatspolitie"
FEA_secret_police_fascist_desc:0 "Red terrorists and foreign secret agents constantly work to frustrate our efforts to reawaken Feathisia's power! We must protect our nation from these criminals, this vermin of the lowest rank! The G-S will investigate every citizen to root out the traitors once and for all. Those who are loyal, have nothing to fear."
FEA_corporate_allies:0 "Our Friends The Corporations"
FEA_corporate_allies_desc:0 "Our preparations for war have not gone unnoticed by our large corporations. Unlike Moldernik and his idiotic desire to attack 'unpatriotic' conglomerates, we will not be so stupid. An alliance with the premier industrialists of Feathisia will ensure a seamless transition of the economy into Heeren's control."
FEA_use_political_prisoners:0 "The Industriële-Revalidatie Act"
FEA_use_political_prisoners_desc:0 "The civil war has cost the lives of many brave souls, and those who conspired with their murderers are still in prison, along with a slew of other undesirables like the overgrown rodents and traitors. Our corporate allies have suggested that they could be put to work in the factories, preforming mindless work in 14 hour shifts. This will soon make them forget their treasonous thoughts. "
FEA_a_new_duke:0 "A New Grand Duke"
FEA_a_new_duke_desc:0 "The legacy of Grand Duke Gerlach looms large over our country and his legacy is the single most important political factor in Feathisia. Perpetual stability can only come with a new Grand Duke. However, the Weijermars family line has been blessed with art-critcs and scientists, not warriors so we will have to settle for the next best thing, a griffon who married into the family."
FEA_proclaim_the_republic:0 "Proclaim The Feathisian Republic"
FEA_proclaim_the_republic_desc:0 "The monarchy has proven its ineffectiveness. Only a national republic led by the Fetisisch Nationaal Verbond can unite the nation under her ancient values. It is time to draft a statute for the Republic, a new proclamation every griffon can rally behind. All hail the Feathisian Republic!"
FEA_feathisia_lives:0 "Feathisia Marches On!"
FEA_feathisia_lives_desc:0 "Despite civil war and economic collapse, the national spirit of Feathisia has not been broken. Instead, the hardships have only strengthened the resolve of citizen and soldier alike to defend our dear Feathisia. But to do this, we must reclaim our ancestral glory and the lands which rightfully belong to the Feathisian Nation."

FEA_c_industry_1:0 "The Reconstruction"
FEA_c_industry_1_desc:0 "The civil war, following Duke Gerlach assassination, may have been brief, but it has crippled our economy for years to come. Unemployment is at an all time high, our industrial bases lies in ruin, and our infrastructure is destroyed and fragmented. Addressing these problems must be the top priority of any new government."
FEA_c_industry_2:0 "Geographical Survey"
FEA_c_industry_2_desc:0 "Feathisia covers a wide domain, with much of our lands poorly explored. The commission of a geographic survey, to properly prospect the fringes of our lands, may very well uncover a wealth of new resources. The development and utilisation of which, would go a long way in repairing our damaged economy."
FEA_c_industry_3:0 "Expand the Steel Industry"
FEA_c_industry_3_desc:0 "Our steel industry has always been plagued by a lack of mills and poor connectivity to the iron and coal seams used to supply it. By investing substantially into developing this sector, we could overcome these hurdles and begin to bridge the gap between us and our more industrialised rivals."
FEA_c_industry_4:0 "Dig for Chromium"
FEA_c_industry_4_desc:0 "Chromium is vital to modern metallurgy. The use of this element, in combination with steel, hardens it and makes it more resistant to corrosion. These benefits are especially vital within modern tank designs, with the most effective armours employing this steel-chromium metal. So, it is of great importance that we locate additional seams of chromium ore."
FEA_c_industry_5:0 "Synthetic Oil Experiments"
FEA_c_industry_5_desc:0 "Our lands are poor in oil, with only limited production taking place in Aiwle. This is frightening considering the importance of oil as a fuel in both industrial operations and military campaigns. However, technology would seem to aid our limited reserves, offering a way to turn our coal into a usable oil-like material. It is of vital importance that we seize this technology and implement it."
FEA_c_industry_6:0 "Rebuild the Railways"
FEA_c_industry_6_desc:0 "During the civil war, many of our rail lines were sabotaged or accidentally damaged in the fierce fighting for De Vleguels. This has made it incredibly difficult to transport goods around our country, severely stunting economic development. The repair of this infrastructure would go a long way in addressing our current economic woes."
FEA_c_industry_7:0 "Restructure the Industrial Sector"
FEA_c_industry_7_desc:0 "Few of our economic assets are in working order, with the vast majority left in a state of disrepair and dysfunction. In order to quickly reboot our economy, we must seize the few viable assets we posses and employ central planning to best guide them towards future repairs and development."
FEA_c_industry_8:0 "Support the Local Arms Industry"
FEA_c_industry_8_desc:0 "Our economy may lie in ruins, but the number of threats we face continues to grow. We must be assured that our soldiers have the supplies they need to fend off foes from abroad and crush enemies from within. To achieve this, we must completely nationalise all arms factories and factories related to military equipment, bringing them further inline with the central party."
FEA_c_industry_9:0 "Rebuild the Rottendedam Dockyards"
FEA_c_industry_9_desc:0 "After Skyfall's independence, the old Imperial naval base has constantly outcompeted us on the market. We must gain back our advantage and build up our own domestic ports. This will help ensure that we never need to rely upon outside factors when securing our national prosperity."
FEA_c_industry_10:0 "Land Clearance"
FEA_c_industry_10_desc:0 "Vast swathes of our lands lie occupied by wilderness, denying us thousands of acres of virgin arable lands. Liberating these from nature would not only add tremendous benefit to our fragile economy, but also employ thousands left without work."
FEA_c_industry_11:0 "Resettle the Countryside"
FEA_c_industry_11_desc:0 "The influx of new arable lands has overwhelmed our existing farmers, leading to much of them going fallow. As such, if we wish to properly exploit these acres, we must bring in labour from our cities. This policy would also have the added benefit of offering a new opportunity to the urbanised population displaced by civil war."
FEA_c_industry_12:0 "Modern Industrial Methods"
FEA_c_industry_12_desc:0 "Equestria stands as the chief industrial power of the world, aided by a wealth of innovators, assets, and cutting-edge technologies. If we wish to reach such a level of development, we must replicate this model. We can do this by acquiring Equestrian patents upon the black market and hiring skilled individuals who don't have scruples taking our money."
FEA_c_industry_13:0 "Electronics Research"
FEA_c_industry_13_desc:0 "Electronics are the future, offering us assistance with research, a means to secure code, and a method to detect enemy aircraft. These technologies could tip a future war in our favour and any investment made towards them now, would pay dividends for decades to come."
FEA_c_industry_14:0 "Support the Mirabelle University"
FEA_c_industry_14_desc:0 "The Mirabelle University is one of Feathisia's crown jewels. For centuries it has taught our citizens courses in a wide range of subjects including engineering, medicine, and various other fields. However, in recent years it has suffered from reduced enrolment and donations, as our economy declines. We must resolve these problems by offering official government support and funding to the university."
FEA_c_industry_15:0 "Finish the Reconstruction"
FEA_c_industry_15_desc:0 "The damage caused by our civil war has finally been remedied, ushering in a new era of wealth and prosperity. The economy of today may be radically different to that of years ago, but our people are well-fed, employed, and sheltered. We stand as the hallmark example of why our political philosophy is the future."
FEA_c_industry_16:0 "Rebuild The Education System"
FEA_c_industry_16_desc:0 "During the civil war, there was no time to educate people. Due to that, we now have to rebuild the education system to give young griffs the proper education and to return to pre-war technological level."

FEA_martial_law:0 "Martial Law"
FEA_martial_law_desc:0 "Martial Law has been instituted to deal with the political chaos in the nation. Grand Duke Gerlach apparently has a solution planned which will ensure the parties will never create such a ruckus again."
FEA_disband_parliament:0 "Disband Parliament"
FEA_disband_parliament_desc:0 "It is clear that the idiots that call themselves politicians have no clue how to run a country. They wouldn't be able to pick what's for dinner without causing a fight. No matter, they will soon be taken care of."
FEA_deal_with_PvdA:0 "Deal with the PvdA"
FEA_deal_with_PvdA_desc:0 "The Partij van de Arbeid's unrealistic plans and anti-monarchist rhetoric was always a thorn in our side, but now they have grown completely unreasonable. They occupy the factories and refuse to work, although they were always the ones clamouring for more jobs. Very well, there is always another way to reduce unemployment."
FEA_pull_them_out:0 "Pull the Rot Out"
FEA_pull_them_out_desc:0 "These spoiled citygriffons have never worked a hard day in their lives. Let us rid ourselves of them and instead build factories in the countryside, where hardworking loyalists can use the employment. Pull them out of the factories. No matter the cost."
FEA_socialist_begone:0 "Annihilate the Red Front"
FEA_socialist_begone_desc:0 "With the factories going back under our control, we will take care of the Communists' organisation. By purging the land clean of their leadership and breaking any spirit left to continue the resistance. If they want a Red Front so badly, we will paint their doors with their blood."
FEA_deal_with_LDP:0 "Deal with the LDP"
FEA_deal_with_LDP_desc:0 "The Liberals always presented themselves as our friends and allies. But now it is clear that they were only looking towards their own goals and were completely disinterested in properly running the country. It matters not, their pathetic Liberation Front won't free them from our just revenge."
FEA_liberals_get_noose_too:0 "The Day of the Rope"
FEA_liberals_get_noose_too_desc:0 "We must arrest all these 'peaceful' protesters that keep breaking order on the streets. Once we get them all arrested, we will show what happens when you scream for freedom but refused to work for it when you had the chance."
FEA_deal_with_the_ringleaders:0 "Kill off the Ringleaders"
FEA_deal_with_the_ringleaders_desc:0 "Now that they are without support, we must press on and find the ringleaders of this pathetic protest. Talonsley and his supporters must be eliminated once and for all. Only afterwards can we build up Feathisia into what it was always meant to be."
FEA_deal_with_the_FNV:0 "Deal with the FNV"
FEA_deal_with_the_FNV_desc:0 "The FNV and their bands of thugs claim to be patriots. They claim to know the will of the people and the right direction for the country. Yet they sow mutiny in the ranks of the army and fight the forces of stability in the streets. We will show them what leadership looks like."
FEA_strangle_the_leadership:0 "Cull the Military"
FEA_strangle_the_leadership_desc:0 "The van Vorst tot Vorsts call themselves nobility, but it is clear that their line has lost all sense of honour. Meanwhile the upstarts Moldernik and Heeren have always been our adversaries. We will show our dear citizens what happens when a general commits treason."
FEA_butcher_the_paramilitaries:0 "Butcher the Paramilitaries"
FEA_butcher_the_paramilitaries_desc:0 "Now that the proper soldiers are taken care of, the paramilitaries of Heeren and Moldernik are the next to go. They have devolved into nothing more than an unruly mob, driven like cattle by their fascists slave drivers. If they behave like cattle, we shall treat them as such."
FEA_dukes_country:0 "The Duke's Country"
FEA_dukes_country_desc:0 "Now that the upstarts and the criminals of society have been taken care of, the Grand Duke can finally focus to doing what he loves, taking care of Feathisia and her well-meaning citizens."
FEA_dukes_education:0 "The Duke's Education Reforms"
FEA_dukes_education_desc:0 "The incompetent coalition that ruled the country before never bothered to reform the education system. We warned that it would mean the country would lose its competitive edge, but other things were considered more urgent by the liberals. We will just have to do it faster and more rigorously then."
FEA_dukes_proper_science_base:0 "Ducal University Grants"
FEA_dukes_proper_science_base_desc:0 "The best, most deserving young griffons will be allowed free access to university. The universities will be oases of higher learning, free from all disruptive influences. The talents that are taught in this way will surely amaze their elders with their bright ideas!"
FEA_the_dukes_army:0 "The Duke's Army"
FEA_the_dukes_army_desc:0 "Many citizens simply desire new stability in their lives and nothing helps more than the army. It is both a stable source of payment and provides a rhythm and discipline to your life. On the other claw it is an excellent way for citizens to help their peers by protecting the vulnerable from any attack. We will take personal control over the army to ensure all goes well."
FEA_new_generals:0 "Promote Loyal Officers"
FEA_new_generals_desc:0 "There has been a lack of generals due to some internal issues with the Feathisian military. Luckily, many lower ranking officers have shown loyalty in the face of adversity. We will promote them to a higher rank to fill the gaps in leadership."
FEA_the_dukes_secret_service:0 "Establish the DGDvdH"
FEA_the_dukes_secret_service_desc:0 "The Duke's Secret Service, while lacking a stylish acronym, is absolutely necessary to make sure none of the citizenry gets misguided by foreign influences or their own stupidity. The secret agents will be given broad powers to monitor and interrogate any suspicious griffon, for their own sake."
FEA_new_officer_core:0 "A New Officer Corps"
FEA_new_officer_core_desc:0 "The Duke has always had an eye for talent and with him inspecting new officer recruits personally, the quality of the Corps has improved tremendously. These new recruits will be given the finest education and the best manuals available. This way Feathisia's leadership will make Gerlach proud!"
FEA_dukes_armouries:0 "Arm the Nation"
FEA_dukes_armouries_desc:0 "Although the nation's internal affairs are largely in order, Feathisia still faces many threats. To survive the coming storms, the military will need to be well armed. The Grand Duke has foreseen this and has ordered the construction of several new arms factories."
FEA_crush_remaining_dissidents:0 "Crush Any Remaining Dissidents"
FEA_crush_remaining_dissidents_desc:0 "Even now, some griffons are simply too stubborn to learn their lessons. No matter, we are always prepared to teach the truth."
FEA_banker_loyalty:0 "Ensure the Bank's Loyalty"
FEA_banker_loyalty_desc:0 "The banks never ceased to back us during these troubled times. We will return the favour and make sure that Feathisia will stay a safe place to invest in, for mutual benefit of both parties."
FEA_the_privy_council:0 "Empower the Privy Council"
FEA_the_privy_council_desc:0 "The Grand Duke's Council has always been a neutral player in the politics of the nation, but it is clear that these wise griffons are needed now more than ever. Their prudent leadership will help us to rebuild the country."
FEA_ancient_claims:0 "Push Ancient Claims"
FEA_ancient_claims_desc:0 "The Grand Duke sees clearly now. Mismanagement of state affairs is not a sickness that only plagued Feathisia. Over the borders the citizens have it even worse. Gerlach has some ancient familial claims to push on these regions. He really hates war, but he is willing to wage it for the common good of Griffonkind."
FEA_industrial_council:0 "Establish the DIRvdH"
FEA_industrial_council_desc:0 "To better coordinate efforts between big business and the state, the Ducal Industrial Council will be created. Comprising of businessgriffs and bureaucrats, this council will provide the Grand Duke with the information he needs to help Feathisia get the most out of its economic strengths."
FEA_a_swamp_griffonian_on_the_throne:0 "Protect Grover's Legacy"
FEA_a_swamp_griffonian_on_the_throne_desc:0 "Emperor Grover V was a close friend of the Grand Duke and after his demise, his successors squandered the values he once stood for. Feathisia has always remained loyal to the Emperor's legacy, even after his death. For the future of Griffonia, we will secure the throne for ourselves."


FEA_recalibrate_the_economy:0 "Recalibrate the Economy"
FEA_recalibrate_the_economy_desc:0 "Feathisia is still suffering from the effects of the last economic crisis. One issue, which has lingered unresolved, is that our economy is too large and lacks sufficient markets to sate its surplus productivity. We can kill two birds with one stone by channelling a portion of this surplus away from the civilian sector and towards our arms industry."
FEA_d_infrastructure_project:0 "Massive Infrastructure Projects"
FEA_d_infrastructure_project_desc:0 "The Feathisian economy suffers from two problems. The first is that there is still a significant portion of our population without stable employment. The second is that our duchy's infrastructure is severely underdeveloped, leading to stunted economic growth. We can resolve both of these issues by investing public money into further developing our transport network."
FEA_d_arms_factories:0 "Expand the Arms Industry"
FEA_d_arms_factories_desc:0 "For years, the arms industry in Feathisia has been incredibly small. This not only denies us access to a whole industry, in which to derive economic benefit, but also leaves us at risk in the face of invasion. To address both of these issues, Duke Gerlach has mandated the expansion of our military-industrial complex."
FEA_steelworks:0 "Grand Steelworks Projects"
FEA_steelworks_desc:0 "Feathisia is a land rich with iron and coal. However, our steel industry is hindered by a lack of mills and infrastructure. In response, Duke Gerlach has called for the construction of new mills. These will more than double our existing output."
FEA_oil_experiments:0 "Synthetic Oil Experiments"
FEA_oil_experiments_desc:0 "Oil is the lifeblood of a modern mechanised army. Without it, we'd be reduced to hauling our equipment upon our backs or with pack animals. This reality is trouble to Duke Gerlach, as our duchy is poor in the resource. However, there has been recent technological breakthroughs which have seen the conversion of coal into a usable oil-like fuel. It may be possible to adapt this research to our needs."
FEA_ducal_dockyards:0 "Trade With the World"
FEA_ducal_dockyards_desc:0 "The ports of Feathisia once served the whole Heartlands. However, due to the recent success of Skyfall, we've found ourselves unable to keep this unique position. In order to address this, Duke Gerlach calls for an expansion of the Rottendedam port facility to attract more traders. No longer will these godsless capitalists outshine Feathisia."
FEA_d_labour_battalion:0 "Establish the Werkbrigades"
FEA_d_labour_battalion_desc:0 "Construction offers an outlet for us to productively utilise our excess labour force. After all, the factories of tomorrow must be built today."
FEA_d_factories:0 "Expand the Industrial Sector"
FEA_d_factories_desc:0 "For decades, our duchy has relied upon the wealth generated from agricultural goods to finance its operations. This is not the way a modern state should operate. Instead, Duke Gerlach has called for the financing of industrial projects within the heartland of our duchy. Not only will these employ thousands, but they'll also bring Feathisia in line with the rest of the developed world."
FEA_d_agrarianism:0 "Support Agrarianism"
FEA_d_agrarianism_desc:0 "There has been growing discontent amongst our nobles over the recent push towards industrialisation. They fear that any further actions, taken to modernise our state, would only further weaken their position within society. We must re-assure these nobles that they are not at risk, and that their productivity is still vital to our society."
FEA_d_modern_methods:0 "Modern Industrial Methods"
FEA_d_modern_methods_desc:0 "Equestria stands as a beacon of technological innovation, housing some of the world's brightest minds. This has allowed Equestria to eclipse the rest of the world in sheer industrial prowess. If Feathisia wishes to reach this might, it must begin to learn from the Equestrian model. In order to achieve this, Duke Gerlach has released funds to lease Equestrian patents and hire skilled Equestrian talent."
FEA_d_engineering_uni:0 "The Ducal Engineering Academy"
FEA_d_engineering_uni_desc:0 "Engineering is the future. Every machine, electrical device, and artificial chemical requires the input of engineers somewhere in its design and production. In order to facilitate this growing demand for engineers, Duke Gerlach has called for the establishment of the Ducal Engineering Academy. This facility will take the finest of Feathisian minds and turn them into a future generation of engineers."
FEA_d_state_unions:0 "Establish the Staatsvakbond"
FEA_d_state_unions_desc:0 "Prior to the attempt on Duke Gerlach's life, unions within Feathisia were a breeding ground for dissenting politics. It was not uncommon for these unions to be led by members of the LDP or PvdA, who acted more towards political goals than actually representing their members. In response, Duke Gerlach has created a single state union which will represent all workers in a politically neutral manner."
FEA_d_war_economy:0 "The Feathisian War Economy"
FEA_d_war_economy_desc:0 "Our military is woefully under-equipped in dealing with its enemies, both domestic and foreign. In order to facilitate a much-needed military build-up, our economy must be recalibrated in such a manner that the armed forces get priority in terms of industrial, productive, and natural resources."
FEA_d_finish_economy:0 "Finish Calibration"
FEA_d_finish_economy_desc:0 "Our economy has never been stronger. We have complete employment, a developed industrial base, an infrastructure network rivalled by few, and a large military which shall protect our citizens. All of this has been provided under the watchful gaze of Duke Gerlach."

FEA_the_throne:0 "The Throne is Ours"
FEA_the_throne_desc:0 "We have done it! We have conquered the imperial throne for ourselves, and we are the Empire reincarnate! This is a glorious day, but we must not rest for too long. There are now many new enemies we face, and there is much work that needs to be done."
FEA_protection_alliance:0 "The Aristocrats"
FEA_protection_alliance_desc:0 "The lands of the Empire are filled with aristocrats, and sadly, many of them are quite... incompetent at their job. We must see to it that these nobles are removed at once."
FEA_PYT_dealing:0 "Deal with Greifenmarschen"
FEA_PYT_dealing_desc:0 "The peasant republic of Greifenmarschen to our south is weak and defenceless. Its leadership must come to realise that they are nothing alone. As part of the Empire, they are part of something greater and stronger."
FEA_core_PYT:0 "Integrate Greifenmarschen"
FEA_core_PYT_desc:0 "With the lands of Greifenmarschen now safely under our control, we can start integrating it into the core parts of our Empire. Together, we are strong!"
FEA_BRZ_and_STW:0 "Look to the North"
FEA_BRZ_and_STW_desc:0 "To our north are the Duchy of Strawberry and the County of Bronzehill. We must ensure their loyalty to the Empire, and the only way to do so appears to be through brute force."
FEA_core_BRZ_and_STW:0 "Integrate the North"
FEA_core_BRZ_and_STW_desc:0 "The North is ours, and we can now pacify the towns and countryside to ensure their absolute loyalty to us. Our northern flank is safe. For now."
FEA_the_south:0 "The Faithful"
FEA_the_south_desc:0 "Down to the south is a group of religious fanatics that are eager for a fight. They hold on tight to their beliefs and trust in the Archons, but that will not save them."
FEA_ROU_and_YAL:0 "Deal With Yale and Romau"
FEA_ROU_and_YAL_desc:0 "The autonomy and self-governance of Yale and Romau must now come to an end. They have proven to be nothing more than incompetent fools who should not rule over countries. Their lands are better ruled directly by us."
FEA_core_ROU_and_YAL:0 "Integrate the Cities"
FEA_core_ROU_and_YAL_desc:0 "The armies of Yale and Romau have been defeated. Now, it is time for imperial law and order to return to these lands."
FEA_KAT_and_ANG:0 "Tame Angriver and Katerin"
FEA_KAT_and_ANG_desc:0 "Angriver and Katerin are unstable and treacherous realms, nothing more. We must bring order to these lands at once!"
FEA_core_KAT_and_ANG:0 "Integrate Angriver and Katerin"
FEA_core_KAT_and_ANG_desc:0 "With the traitors defeated, we can finally let peace return to the lands of Katerin and Angriver. Henceforth, imperial rule and law shall keep the region stable and in its place."
FEA_the_empire_rises:0 "The Empire Rises"

FEA_reclaim_north:0 "Reclaim the North"
FEA_reclaim_north_desc:0 "The North, like the majority of the continent, rightfully belongs to the Empire, and is home to the old republican rebels that once started the rapid decline of the Empire. We must destroy this vile rebellion once and for all, and reconquer the rest of the north with them!"
FEA_core_north:0 "Northern Reintegration"

FEA_reclaim_center:0 "Reclaim Central Griffonia"
FEA_reclaim_center_desc:0 "Central Griffonia is the heart of the continent and, most importantly, home to Griffonstone, the place where the Empire was first founded and ruled from. We cannot allow for others to hold onto such a historic plot of land!"
FEA_core_center:0 "The Birthplace of Griffonkind"
FEA_core_center_desc:0 "Finally, after many, many years, the Empire returns to its birthplace. But not just the birthplace of the Empire, but the birthplace of all griffons. Let us honour this place and celebrate its return to the fold."
FEA_reclaim_west:0 "Reclaim the West"
FEA_reclaim_west_desc:0 "The West is home not only to the great trading port of Skyfall, which also houses the old imperial fleet, but our old rivals of Aquileia also live here. The Discrets once rejected imperial rule and declared themselves independent many years ago. We shall undo this mistake."
FEA_core_west:0 "The Western Provinces"
FEA_core_west_desc:0 "The important provinces to our west are now part of the Empire, once more. We must make sure to secure these lands as soon as possible, so that we can hold onto them, for sure."
FEA_reclaim_south:0 "Reclaim the South"
FEA_reclaim_south_desc:0 "The reconquest of the south has been a long-living dream of every supporter of the Empire. The treacherous griffons of Wingbardy were the staunchest of rivals the Empire has ever faced, and they were the very first to declare independence when the Empire began its downfall. Now, we are back, and stronger than ever."
FEA_core_south:0 "The Southern Triumph"

FEA_reclaim_colony:0 "Reclaim Nova Griffonia"
FEA_reclaim_colony_desc:0 "The colony of Nova Griffonia, too, declared its independence from us many years ago. While it was not very important to us back then, it is now, and we must make it clear to them that we are still their masters."

FEA_emergency_conscription_desc:0 "After running through the numbers, Pechvogel has decided that the army will need more griffons to hold back the invader. We will convince the parties of the mathematical truth behind our proposals so we can instate more extensive conscription."
FEA_hasty_fortifications:0 "Last Minute Fortifications"

FEA_militias_raised:0 "Call Upon the Militias"
FEA_militias_raised_desc:0 "When the civil war formed, many militias started patrolling the big cities to keep their homes save during the violence. These militias must now defend their homes once more, from a foreign invader. They might not be the best equipped troops, but we must go all in to defend Feathisia!"
FEA_mobilize_the_nation:0 "Mobilise the Nation"
FEA_mobilize_the_nation_desc:0 "Every citizen must set aside their notions of class and ideology for a greater cause, the cause of their homes.

### Events ###
feat.1.t:0 "Saving the Economy"
feat.1.d:0 "Parliament debated the budget today and it was an unusually heated deliberation by Feathisian standards. Two budget plans for the next years were put forward, one by the Ministry of Finance and one by the ministry of Economic Affairs. The first one would try to balance the books, only supporting a limited intervention in key areas and then counting on the market to readjust. The  second one proposed a radical restructuring of the economy, with increased state control, even if this meant state debt. As one of the delegates requested a roll call vote, the representatives announced their decision one by one. The result determined the economic future of the entire Grand Duchy."
feat.1.a:0 "Limited intervention, let us not be overbearing."
feat.1.b:0 "We must take drastic measures!"

feat.2.t:0 "Protests"
feat.2.d:0 "Due to the recent increase in taxes, massive protests have been organised throughout our duchy. While peaceful in origin, it can not be ignored that the protesters are aiming increasing criticism at the LDP and FHP. They claim that the coalition is using their position of power to protect the landed elite and foreign investors."
feat.2.a:0 "This is for your own good!"

feat.3.t:0 "Kogchel's Speech"
feat.3.d:0 "In response to the recent cuts in government spending, leader of the PvdA, Gerben Kogchel, has criticised the leading coalition for working against the common citizen. In his speech, he calls the cuts to art grants and environmental protections a dangerous first step in the road to stripping the civil and economic liberties of the commoner. While his speech received a lukewarm reception in the House of Representatives, it has picked up some traction amongst the urbanised working class, who have aligned themselves against further austerity."
feat.3.a:0 "Yes, that's very nice, now go back to your seat."

feat.4.t:0 "MP Defections"
feat.4.d:0 "As opposition to the current economic policy of the LDP-FHP coalition mounts, a number of FHP MPs have grown worried about their prospects for re-election. These MPs come from districts which have been hit especially hard by the austerity of De Vleguels. In response, they have split away from the traditional FHP party and have allied themselves with the FNV caucus, in the hope that they will be properly represented in a future FNV government."
feat.4.a:0 "Who needs them?"

feat.5.t:0 "Plight of the Farmer"
feat.5.d:0 "Recent actions by the coalition government have seen the displacement of many landed farmers, turning thousands into landless tenants. The story of these poor individuals, removed from their ancestral lands, has recently reached the press, bringing their story to the entirety of Feathisian society. In response to this story, the FNV has added a declaration to their party platform which would overturn the recent nationalisation of farms, returning the lands to their proper owners."
feat.5.a:0 "Such a moving speech."

feat.6.t:0 "Noble Donations"
feat.6.d:0 "One of our nobles has returned from a highly profitable venture to the Riverlands. Upon seeing the economic hardship of our people, he has decided to invest a majority of his proceeds into a series of economic projects in his home state.\n\nAt the opening ceremony, for the first of these project, he gave a speech praising the level-headed governance of the LDP-FHP coalition, thanking them for their years of faithful service."
feat.6.a:0 "A thanks to our stiff-necked friends!"

feat.7.t:0 "Work for the Unemployed"
feat.7.d:0 "The recent economic depression has left many of our citizens unemployed and without stable income. In order to address this, our government has begun to finance large public work projects. These will not only create tens of thousands of construction jobs but also go a long way in helping to remedy the underdeveloped infrastructure of our duchy."
feat.7.a:0 "Focus on the infrastructure projects."
feat.7.b:0 "Focus on the industrial projects."
feat.7.c:0 "Focus on both projects."

feat.8.t:0 "Support For the Farmer Welfare Act"
feat.8.d:0 "The rural population of Feathisia has been hit exceptionally hard by our current economic depression. This is due to the price of many agricultural goods crashing as demand and markets shrink.\n\nTo address this problem, the Feathisian House of Representatives has passed the Farmer Welfare Act. This allows the government to act as a buyer of agricultural goods, creating a market where it might not otherwise exist. Hopefully, this will return a degree of financial stability to our rural areas."
feat.8.a:0 "Good to hear."

feat.9.t:0 "Feathisian Deal"
feat.9.d:0 "An envoy from Feathisia recently arrived with news of a business opportunity. They wish for us to invest in their nation, with the hopes that it will help them with their economic troubles, and that we can profit from it once they recover."

feat.9.b:0 "This seems to be too good to be true..."

feat.10.t:0 "[From.GetName] Accepts"

feat.10.a:0 "Great!"

feat.11.t:0 "[From.GetName] Declines"
feat.11.d:0 "Our envoys have returned from [From.GetName] with bad news. The capitalists of [From.GetName] have deemed our duchy as too risky of an investment and have informed us that they will not be taking us up on our offer."
feat.11.a:0 "Oh well."

feat.12.t:0 "Moldernik's Speech"
feat.12.d:0 "Crowds of FNV supporters have gathered in the streets once more to witness a speech from the party leader. With his signature impassioned ways, he managed to rile up the crowd with his concerns about the economic crisis. He promises that the FNV will make Feathisia into a great and prosperous nation once more, free of toxic influences that do nothing but leech off of the griffons that call it home. He called out the current government's inaction and promised that procedures and political games wouldn't stop the FNV from doing what's right for the country."
feat.12.a:0 "Your concerns have been noted."

feat.13.t:0 "Mirabelle Gunpowder Disaster"
feat.13.d:0 "Disaster has struck in the riverside city of Mirabelle, after a local gunpowder factory was given over to control by the workers. A series of mistakes caused by inexperience in managing and running the facility has lead to a tragedy, with the factory erupting in an explosion that shook the whole city. There are few survivors, and it has caused many to grow weary of such changes in management."
feat.13.a:0 "We can't be blamed for this!"

feat.14.t:0 "The Cosa Nostra Scandal"
feat.14.d:0 "The opening of our markets to foreign capital has been a success overall, all of our economists agree. However, the lax control and regulation on foreign investments has created a significant problem.\n\nA number of Wingbardian criminal families have slipped through our law enforcement and have established themselves in several Feathisian cities. Their initial impact mostly went by unnoticed, as they didn't cause any real trouble with their illegal racketeering. Almost all of the affected labourers are foreigners, and the services and products that they sold have shown to be beneficial to the growth of their respective industries, raising few eyebrows. The few officials who did attempt to investigate into these operations were bribed and there is no concurrent investigation in any of these operations.\n\nThis changed when violence erupted between two rival crime families, killing several innocent bystanders and destroying several local businesses and shops in the port city of Rottendedam.\n\nWith the public now fully aware of what has taken place, many are publicly questioning our economic and judicial policies that have allowed for the establishment of 'The Cosa Nostra' in our country."
feat.14.a:0 "Can't win them all I suppose."

feat.15.t:0 "Landbouwbeurs"
feat.15.d:0 "Landbouwbeurs, or land fairs, are agricultural expos where producers of both agricultural products and technology show off their wares to the rural denizens of our domain. In recent years, there has been increased emphasis on new technologies, such as tractors, artificial fertilisers, and pesticides.\n\nThese fairs are a great opportunity for our citizens to get out with their families and attempt to ignore the current economic woes."
feat.15.a:0 "Fun for the whole family!"

feat.16.t:0 "Union Protests"
feat.16.d:0 "Leaders of local unions have called for protests against our administration. Workers have taken to the streets, causing minor political upheaval in the areas they're functioning."
feat.16.a:0 "Who cares about what they think?"

feat.17.t:0 "De Vleguels Motor Club"
feat.17.d:0 "The Capital has seen the birth of a new organisation, De Vleugels Motor Club. Founded by car and motor enthusiasts, the club has been made for all griffons to have fun with their vehicles. The club has found an ally in the FNV party, as both the club and the fascists support better infrastructure with majestic highway plans through scenic areas so that everygriffon can enjoy Feathisia's natural beauty."
feat.17.a:0 "Sounds fun!"

feat.18.t:0 "Adriaan van Wingaarden's Computing Machine"
feat.18.d:0 "Adriaan van Wingaarden, a mathematician from Rottendedam now working for the Mathematisch Centrum, has created a computing device he calls the Automatische Relais Rekenmachine De Vleugels (ARRDV). This relay computer is based on a Wingbardian design and can calculate several hundred complex algorithms an hour.\n\nHe hopes that his invention can revolutionise the field of mathematics and has already envisioned banking organisations using ARRDVs to manage their money. Perhaps, he suggests, that one day, everygriffon would have an ARRDV in their home."
feat.18.a:0 "Perhaps it needs a catchier name first."

feat.19.t:0 "Controversy"
feat.19.d:0 "In light of the recent developments in government policy, increasing criticism has been levelled at Grand Duke Gerlach IV. These critics claim that he is not doing enough with his royal veto to overrule the unpopular and harmful decisions of his government. Recently, there has been a growing number of individuals, asking him to stand up to his ministers and put a stop to any further laws that will hurt his citizens."
feat.19.a:0 "You'll all be thankful later!"

feat.20.t:0 "Heeren's Grand Speech"
feat.20.d:0 "Rottendedam was gripped with excitement and dread as the FNV Deputy Godfried Heeren gave a speech to a crowd of fanatic supporters and onlookers. In his speech he addressed the struggling economy of Feathisia, stating that the reasons for these economic malaise were Feathisia's unstable and hawkish neighbours, constantly warring with each other. Furthermore he blamed the inept businessgriffs and bureaucrats leading Skyfall whom he called out for caring little for the average Griffon, rather only worrying about lining their own pockets. More worryingly Heeren also blamed the local Pony population of Rottendedam, calling them parasites and leeches who only seek to work against the interests of Feathisia and her people. Heeren's fiery speech and bold accusations naturally sparked outrage amongst most of the population. However it seems that in spite of this the Bronzen Schildwachten branch of the FNV just became a lot more popular..."
feat.20.a:0 "Instate extra patrols in pony neighbourhoods, just to be sure."

feat.21.t:0 "For My Sentinels"
feat.21.d:0 "In an economic slump unlike many others, it is impressive to see new books being published, in this case it is a single best seller written by the FNV Chief Deputy Godfried Hereen. Titled 'To My Sentinels' the book details his time spent training with the Orangecoats, the paramilitary arm of the Bronze Sentinels, one of the many far-right parties that were integrated into the FNV. He is quite proud of the organisation, and considers them to be the safeguards of Feathisian ideals, history, and identity. This had caused all manner of speculation within the Duchy, leading many to believe he had received funding from some powerful friends within the government, or perhaps even foreign aid? Only time will tell however, as it just surpasses the recently published 'Daring Do' novel. "
feat.21.a:0 "Keep a close watch on Mister Heeren would you kindly?"

feat.22.t:0 "The Regency Debate" #DO NOT TOUCH OR I STAB YOU -PSODY YES IMPALE ME DADDY
feat.22.d_duchess:0 "The death of Emperor Grover has left the entire empire in turmoil. His heir is too young to rule alone and Griffenheim turned into a political showdown between two parties - those that supported Duchess Eagleclaw as regent and those that supported Archon Eros. Many griffons in Feathisia, along with the Duke himself, backed Duchess Eagleclaw and her more moderate policies. Now that the Duchess has rightfully taken control of the Imperial government, some lords have severed their vassalage and tensions are brewing. The Archons' defiance has enflamed political debate on where the country should head now."

Many griffons in Feathisia, along with the Duke himself, backed Duchess Eagleclaw and her more moderate policies. Now that the Archon has seized control of the Imperial government, Feathisia has severed their vassalage. The formal declaration of independence has enflamed political debate on where the country should head now."
feat.22.a:0 "A worrisome development..."
feat.22.b:0 "You will not get away with this, Archons!"

feat.23.t:0 "The Coalition Breaks!"
feat.23.d:0 "The economic crisis and the events in Griffenheim have eroded all sense of unity among the normally so stable coalition that governs Feathisia. The Liberaal Democratische Partij announced today that their differences with the FHP are irreconcilable. The LDP ministers have offered their resignation to Duke Gerlach, while the FHP remains in a minority government for the time being."
feat.23.a:0 "The Opposition must see reason!"

feat.24.t:0 "The Vote of No Confidence"
feat.24.d:0 "After a heated debate in the Feathisian Parliament, where the opposition viciously debated the FHP government, the pragmatism and gentleness of Feathisian politics seems all but gone. The PvdA and FNV fraction leaders shouted accusations at the prime minister, while the LDP also attacked them. At the end of the debate, which lasted until well after midnight, the opposition announced a vote of no confidence.\n\nWhen Feathisia woke up next day, the country learned that the government had been voted out, signalling the continuation of a turbulent time for the Grand Duchy. "
feat.24.a:0 "Back to the drawing board then..."

feat.25.t:0 "Prime Minister Talonsley's Criticism"
feat.25.d:0 "Talonsley, head of the LDP and prime minister in the LDP-FHP coalition has criticised the Grand Duke himself for the recent interventionism, accusing his friend of not thinking this through, while the liberal said he had warned against intervening too much in the economy. That the prime minister was so outspoken has shocked Feathisia and many wonder if this wound can be healed."
feat.25.a:0 "Et tu?"

feat.26.t:0 "The New Government"
feat.26.d:0 "A new bipartisan coalition has been formed, but the question of which party shall take a dominant role still remains. The situation is still uneasy, as resentment between the aristocratic upper classes and the proletariat leading the PvdA has brought into question the longevity of this new coalition. However, both of the groups have managed to keep things calm for now, for the sake of their respective goals. The peace is uneasy and possibly fragile, but it is unlikely to be broken soon."
feat.26.a:0 "The FHP takes the lead!"
feat.26.b:0 "The PvdA takes the lead!"

feat.27.t:0 "The New Government"
feat.27.d:0 "A new bipartisan coalition has been formed, but the question of which party shall take a dominant role still remains. The supporters of the old government- among them both liberals and nobility- can breath a sigh of relief. The status quo has been restored, and Feathisia is once again in the claws of a capable coalition. The mood of the government is confident and assured that things will soon return to normalcy, with the extremists defeated."
feat.27.a:0 "The FHP takes the lead!"
feat.27.b:0 "The LDP takes the lead!"

feat.28.t:0 "The New Government"
feat.28.d:0 "A new bipartisan coalition has been formed, but the question of which party shall take a dominant role still remains. Despite their ideological differences, the liberals and nationalists have come together for the sake of Feathisia and her people. There is still conflict within the coalition over how to achieve prosperity and maintain the well being of the nation's citizens, but their common goal unites them. However long this unity will last, however, is unknown."
feat.28.a:0 "The FNV takes the lead!"
feat.28.b:0 "The LDP takes the lead!"

feat.29.t:0 "Education Reforms"
feat.29.d:0 "Our duchy is plagued by illiteracy, with the vast majority of our population unable to read or write effectively. This severely hampers economic growth, as our population is often unable to access materials which could expand their skill base.\n\nThis illiteracy has been aided by an archaic education system. Access to it is limited, with only two methods available. The first, is for rich families who are able to afford tutors or tuition to boarding school. The other, is via the charity of the temples. Though this source is limited in scope and resources.\n\nIn order to address our illiteracy, the government of Feathisia calls for the establishment of a Ministry of Education. This ministry would use government funds to establish public schools, while being supported by a government mandate which calls for every child between 6 and 12 to be enrolled in some form of education."
feat.29.a:0 "We're making good progress."

feat.30.t:0 "Education Reforms Finalised"
feat.30.d:0 "While our current reforms have done wonders in increasing the literacy rate among our younger citizens, there is still a massive chunk of our population who is too old to attend school but remain illiterate.\n\nTo address this, the Minister of Education has established the Grensscholen program, or frontier school program. This initiative would see teachers employed at factories, farms, mines, timber camps, and various other working class positions. During the day, they will provide assistance to the labour force, while in the evening, teaching lessons in mathematics, reading, and writing to their co-workers."
feat.30.a:0 "Finally!"

feat.31.t:0 "Positive Reception to Youth Groups"
feat.31.d:0 "At the recent Jeugdwind-days, thousands of young griffons camped in the wilderness of the Central Plains. It was a weekend full of excitement and fun for the young patriots and their leaders. Word of the success of the camping trip has spread across the country, gaining the FNV some sympathy. Some were afraid of the prominence given to the Jeugdwind lately, but with good news such as this, the populace is warming up to having their young join the Youth Groups."
feat.31.a:0 "That's good to hear."

feat.32.t:0 "Heeren's Murder"
feat.32.d:0 "Godfried Heeren, deputy of the FNV and leader of the Bronzen Schildwachten was murdered this evening. An assassin fired three bullets at Heeren, who was giving a speech in a large brewery hall. The assailant was heard shouting something about the revolution and the workers and is assumed to be a communist, although he got away. Angered at such a blatant murder, Anton Moldernik has called for the government to do something against the PvdA, but the justice department has declined, stating that there is no solid evidence the Labour Party even had anything to do with the attack. If it was a communist plot, it may prove to be counter-productive, however, as the absence of Heeren has eased tensions between the liberals and the nationalists, improving the chances of the coalition surviving."
feat.32.a:0 "Should have just retired, old friend."

feat.33.t:0 "The Sentinel Uprising"
feat.33.d:0 "After Heeren's murder, riots broke out in the FNV stronghold of Rottendedam. Bronze Sentinels erected barricades, holding up portraits of their leader and shouting prayers to Arcturus to send them a new champion. The insurrection caused several army units and the police to be called in. The Bronze Sentinels dug in and announced that any attempts to break their insurrection would lead to violence. For weeks on end, the centre of Rottendedam was under siege, the Sentinels slowly starving, but unwilling to give up.\n\nWhen their rations depleted, the radicals elected to sally out, unwilling to fall into the claws of the authorities. Although the battle was fierce and the Sentinels did not retreat an inch, they were no match for the disciplined soldiers of the Feathisian Army. This was effectively the end of the Bronze Sentinel organisation's relevance."
feat.33.a:0 "What a bunch of animals."

feat.34.t:0 "The New Deputy"
feat.34.d:0 "Meindert Roost-Tonijningen has become the new Deputy of the Fethisisch Nationaal Verbond, replacing the recently murdered Heeren. Although Meindert is an eccentric figure in his own right, he is not expected to go against party policies. After his appointment, the new deputy stated to the press that he would do everything in his power to make sure the new coalition succeeds."
feat.34.a:0 "Hopefully he's more sane than the last one."

feat.35.t:0 "Bronze Sentinels Side-lined"
feat.35.d:0 "After we attracted many moderates from the FNV party, their numbers seem to dwindle. Realising that their radical wing is losing them votes, now that moderate solutions are saving the day in Feathisia, Moldernik has announced a change in course. He has booted Heeren and his radical Bronze Sentinels from the party. Heeren has issued a furious statement and to say that he disagrees with this decision would be an understatement. Regardless of this, the most radical people in Feathisian politics just lost their voice."
feat.35.a:0 "A farewell to our former friends."

feat.36.t:0 "Heeren's Arrest"
feat.36.d:0 "Godfried Heeren, ex-deputy of the Fetisisch Nationalistisch Verbond was arrested by the newly formed national police. The police had raided an old Brewhouse in De Vleugels, where they found several Bronze Sentinels and notes that they were storing weapons for a coup. They had hoped that if they could secure several key buildings and get the loyalty of the army, they could take over the country. The FNV and the other parties were quick to denounce these plans and it looks like the nationalist Heeren and his co-conspirators will be looking at a long prison sentence."
feat.36.a:0 "What happened to you Godfried..."

feat.37.t:0 "School Scandal"
feat.37.d:0 "With the enacting of the Mandatory Learning Act, all young griffons are being educated by supposedly qualified teachers and professors. However, a recent news article has put the standards that educators are supposed to adhere to into question.\n\nThe article dives deep into the salacious details of an adult professor's inappropriate behaviour towards a student, sparking outrage from all of Feathisian society; the more conservative circles were particularly vocal in their protests, and there are calls for the abuser's head and for an investigation of the Mandatory Learning Act. Needless to say, this has publicly embarrassed the FHP, and many of its scandalised members have openly renounced their support for the party."
feat.37.a:0 "..."

feat.38.t:0 "The Valletti Trial"
feat.38.d:0 "The newspapers have become enthralled in recent weeks with following the trial of one Gallo Valletti, a Wingbardian immigrant who stands accused public indecency. While such a trial would hardly be newsworthy, he has captured the attention of griffons throughout the nation by claiming that he was arrested and put on trial due to the fact he was Wingbardian, and not the crime itself.\n\nMany high ranking LDP supporters have spoken out in favour of Valletti's case, citing a lack of evidence and an the fact that no other griffon has been arrested for using the wrong bathroom before. However, there are many who still call for Valletti to receive the harshest sentence he can get, many of which are supporters of the FNV.\n\nWith the final hearing taking place, the nation is on the edge of its seat."
feat.38.a:0 "He's innocent."
feat.38.b:0 "He's guilty."

feat.39.t:0 "An Interesting Proposal"
feat.39.d:0 "A local Rottendedam official has discreetly approached the government with regards of an offer that he has received from one of the local Wingbardian crime families. Somehow they've caught wind that the Feathisian army is still short on rifles to consider all of our divisions properly armed, and are willing to give a substantial cache of rifles from Nova Griffonia in exchange for law enforcement to turn a blind eye to some of their more... egregious activities.\n\nOur local government representative at Rottendedam knows that allowing this free reign will only hurt the public faith in government institutions, and had originally intended to arrest the culprits to then publicly showcase a 'judicial victory' against a well-entrenched adversary. However, he too knows about the current supply problem in the army, and decided to ask how he should respond to the offer."
feat.39.a:0 "Have those responsible arrested!"
feat.39.b:0 "That is quite a deal..."

feat.40.t:0 "Banks Withdraw Support"
feat.40.d:0 "After our radical swing, the banks have downgraded our credit rating and deemed us an unwise investment. It appears these 'experts' aren't as wise as they seem."
feat.40.a:0 "We don't need them anyway!"

feat.41.t:0 "Rozenkamp Kicked Out"
feat.41.d:0 "In an effort to co-operate better with our new allies and friends, the PvdA has decided to get rid of the fringe faction led by the Rozenkamp brothers. They led a group that advocated for a mix between nationalism and a focus on class conflict, with a radical hatred of nobility and the Empire especially. These believes simply have no place in our party anymore, which is why Kogchel has booted them. Feathisia is left wondering what a world would look like under the Rozenkamps, who were a colourful voice in Feathisian politics with their often self-contradicting rhetoric."
feat.41.a:0 "I still don't know what he was..."

feat.42.t:0 "The Attempt"
feat.42.d:0 "While visiting Rottendedam's poor harbour district to open a children's hospital, the Grand Duke was approached by a fan. His eyes glistened and he shouted praise at the noblegriffon while he approached. The Grand Duke frowned a little but then gave the griffon a smile. It was a gloomy day, but nothing a friendly conversation couldn't clear up.\n\nThe Grand Duke's thoughts floated away for a moment. Soon he would have to go back to the negotiating table to get the PvdA and FNV to agree on a coalition. Moldernik and Kogchel were surprisingly easy to work with and they had some similar ideas on economic policy, but it would be a challenge to keep the radical parts of the socialists and nationalists in line.\n\nSomething had changed in the admirer's eyes. Fear, anger? "Are you alright, sir?" Gerlach asked, approaching closer. In a flash, the griffon's claw reached into his coat, pulling out a gun. The Grand Duke stared at the assassin in disbelief, before collapsing to the floor.\n\nWhile guards killed the assailant, hospital staff preformed first aid on the Grand Duke. Although most of the bullets hit non vital organs, one of the bullets penetrated Gerlach's skull and he had to be kept in a coma for the time being. The entire nation prayed for the Duke as Feathisia's best doctors perform the surgery on his skull. Many know that Gerlach's person is one of the only things holding Feathisia together."

Protests and even riots are growing rampant, with the police barely keeping orders in the streets of Mirabelle and Rottendedam. At the eleventh hour, Gerben Kogchel and Anton Moldernik met to try and contain the crisis. No griffon else present, the two shook claws before sitting down and grabbing their papers from their suitcases.\n\n"Thank the gods you are here, Gerben." Moldernik gave a slight smile to his political adversary, before looking down to his documents. "So, where were we?"\n\n"The military, I believe, Anton." Kogchel answered, sighing. "About that, I agree with you that we better not politicise the army, but we should allow them to unionise." Moldernik shook his head as Kogchel continued. "Rozenkamp will have my head if I don't allow that, you have to help me out here." The socialist's eyes pleaded with Anton, who again shook his head.\n\n"I get it, but I have the Baron telling me he'll court-martial every soldier who asks for a union."\n\n"The economy then." The PvdA leader stated. Both griffons turned a few pages in their documents and after half an hour of negotiations Kogchel smiled. "I think the Welfare program looks acceptable to me, Anton."\n\n Moldernik took a deep breath. "Only Feathisians."\n"You mean no ponies, Anton. That's not you."\n"Gods no. Well, he means that." The nationalist continues, "Heeren will turn Rottendedam into a slaughterhouse if I don't give him this, Gerben, please."\n"Stappenbeld will make Mirabelle a battlefield if I do." The socialist answered resolutely.\n\n"This is it then." Moldernik declared, standing up, leaving his papers on the table as Kogchel packs his suitcase.\n\n"I am sorry, Mister Moldernik." The socialist shook the nationalist's claw.\n\n"Gods preserve us, Mister Kogchel."\n\n"Gods preserve us all." The leaders of the FNV and PvdA parted ways, steeling themselves for the coming conflict.\n\nThey would never meet again."

feat.44.d:0 "After a long and hard struggle for control over key cities and provinces, the PvdA, consisting mostly of workers' militias along with several loyal army units has won the civil war by mounting a last assault on de Vleugels, waving the Red Flag over the Parliament building. The civil war has radicalised supporters of the party. Rozenkamp's mix of nationalism and communism and Stappenbeld's more straightforward central communist ideas now compete with the ideas of party leader Kogchel, who still hopes for a somewhat moderate solution."

feat.45.d:0 "In a speech broadcast to every radio in Feathisia, Grand Duke Gerlach spoke from his manor. Apparently the attempt on his life scarred him greatly. His calm and collected composure couldn't hide an undertone of seething anger in his voice. Declaring that the political and economic situation is out of control, the Duke took direct control over the armed forces and issued martial law until the situation is back under control. Many Feathisians received the news of the Grand Duke taking over with joy. He was quite possibly the most reasonable griffon in the country and they expected Feathisia to soon be back to normal again."

feat.46.d:0 "In what remains of the old parliament building, delegates and members of the PvdA party have gathered. Except for the Socialist banner hanging proudly in the hall, the place looks abysmal. Shattered glass at the feet of the windows that used to light the chamber, chairs missing and the portrait of the late Duke stood below where it hung, turned around so the delegates didn't have to look into his judging eyes. Grizzled civil war veterans, ex-PvdA members of parliament and union representatives have gathered to try and get the country back into shape.\n\nThree major options have presented themselves. Kogchel, the old leader of the moderate wing of the PvdA, could be entrusted to power. He appeals to reason and the old tradition of Feathisian democracy, hopeful that from the ashes a utopia can rise. Stappenbeld, a left-wing journalist who visited Stalliongrad, leads the communist faction. A fringe in the old PvdA, the communists have gained more traction during the civil war. Finally, the militant Rozenkamp brothers take the stage. Delivering a fiery speech about how they helped defeat capitalism and that the revolution can only be safeguarded by moulding Feathisia into what amounts to a National-Communist Police State, they find cheers of support amongst the veterans from the war. As the delegates cast their votes after a day of heated debate, the parliament building falls silent, as each griffon realises that their vote might be decisive in shaping the future of Feathisia."

He moved swiftly to appoint supporters to important positions and has ensured the loyalty of the socialist soldiers, unions and the party.\n\nTo explain the new direction of the country, Stappenbeld has penned a lengthy article for 'Rood!' the communist newspaper he helped create himself. The general secretary plans to reorganise the capitalist system into a hybrid model that he calls 'instructions from the top, control from the bottom.' Industry will be centrally planned, but individual factories will be managed by workers themselves, with a similar system for agriculture.\n\nIt would take Feathisians some time to get used to the centralised party hierarchy of Stappenbeld's Stallionism, but for now, the system seemed to promise greater wealth for the common griffon. To symbolise the change in regime, the PvdA has been renamed the Communist Party of Feathisia, or the CPvF. The country itself will now be called the United Communes of Feathisia, leaving behind the ducal past."

feat.48.d:0 "The sun had set a few hours ago as Gerben Kogchel made his way through an abandoned hotel building in De Vleugels. The eleventh floor was full of rubble, and it took the griffon some effort to make his way to his destination. It was a good thing he did not come in suit, for his clothes were smudged and cut. But, with a final push Kogchel made it to the room where he had that one fateful meeting. It now seemed an eternity ago, but the room still looked exactly as Moldernik and he had left it. The socialist wiped the dirt from his clothes, before sitting down and putting a suitcase full of dents on the table in front of him. He had donned a slight smile.\n\n"The military then..." The labour party leader went through his notes, pen in his claws. "We're going to have to change some things. We will save what we can, but the army will no longer be a recruiting platform for your ideas, Anton."\n\nKogchel turned the page towards his notes on democracy. "I am of the opinion that, Mister Talonsley, democracy does not stop at the gates of parliament. Work is a large part of one's life, so every being deserves a say in their workplace." Gerben scribbled frantically in the margins of his papers, sunk deep in thought.\n\n"And we cannot forget a robust system of social security. We will ensure adequate healthcare and good education for all griffons. And we will make it so that more and more griffons can join the middle class, instead of making war upon them, Mister Rozenkamp."\n\nThe lone griffon closed his eyes and imagined the dream which had pulled him through to this point; all the cities built up again, every village bustling with activity. Every child in class, bread in every basket and peace in the land. He could feel it, it was within reach, if he could just touch it- And the image was gone again, just before he could escape to that world. "Will I ever see it, is it even possible?" Gerben asked out loud, his spirit dropping as he put his papers back into his suitcase. He sighed loudly, driving those depressing thoughts away. "What a selfish question. They have given me a second chance, I will not disappoint them."\n\nThe one lone griffon stood up, making his way back through the destroyed corridor. He would have a pleasant dream tonight and tomorrow, he would share it with the nation. And tomorrow night? Tomorrow night every Feathisian would dream again."

feat.49.d:0 "Once the convention empowered Herman Rozenkamp, they signed the fate of Feathisia. The National Revolution would now commence. But first, it was time for the Rozenkamps to go back to their roots. Live on the radio and filmed for the news, the Rozenkamp brothers returned to their old neighbourhood in Mirabelle. There, the brothers' portraits were hanging behind many windows. Red banners decorated the narrow street where the brothers grew up. The Rozenkamps were hailed as heroes, surrounded by the workers who had struggled with them since the beginning. One of the burly metalworkers pulled Herman on his shoulders, giving him a platform to speak. The crowd silenced, eager to hear what the griffon, who in their eyes had an aura larger than life, had to say.\n\n"Griffons, Feathisians, workers! We have won our victory!"\n\nThe crowd cheered, throwing their caps into the air. "Your blood, your sweat and your sacrifice have brought us here. And I am humbled to stand before you now to announce our red dawn. Our national socialist future!" Herman's eyes shone menacingly, the crowd hanging by his beak, savouring every word he said. "We have killed the fascists and saved our Feathisia for socialism, but there are still enemies a plenty. Those that would destroy us, if we give them a single chance. The capitalist pigs! The Archons! The Nobles! The Liberals! The Ponies! Every griffon that wants to take what we earned for themselves. I ask you one simple question; will we let that happen?"\n\n"No! No! No!" the crowd shouted out, a base instinct taking over.\n\n"Then we must leave the nest of the PvdA and fly out to reach national socialism. I have brought you victory before. I can give it to you again, my dear friends. Will you let me lead you?"\n\nOne voice screamed "Rozenkamp is our Leader!" and a moment later the packed street was filled with deafening pledges of support, one more fanatical than the last.\n\n"Victory for Feathisia, victory for the revolution! Griffonia shall run red with the blood of our enemies!" Rozenkamp spurred on the crowd into a zealous frenzy. The griffons kept shouting in support, then turning to songs while carrying their new leader through the narrow streets of tall brick houses which housed so much of the Feathisian workforce. Herman let it be, this was his home and he relished the feeling of raw power. His brother walked in the middle of the crowd, a quiet smirk on his face. All was well."

Today the mansion stands unoccupied and the lush gardens have made way for artillery emplacements that shelled the city during the civil war. Many a politician's fate was decided between the walls of the noble villa and this day it would be no different. FNV Party members, war heroes and representatives of Feathisia's largest industries have gathered to decide their next move.\n\nGrim faced and donning the uniform of the old Feathisian Army, Baron Herman of Vorst tot Vorst sits amidst his staff. He had sided with the FNV early on, but now that the party was close to power, he realised they couldn't protect the country. It was no matter, his soldiers surrounded the building. One signal and Feathisia could be his, he had but to cast the die.\n\nThe two hotheads of the party, meanwhile, were debating which policies to take and it was becoming clear that a decision for party leadership had to be made. Moldernik defended, in broad senses, the same policies the FNV stood for before the civil war. Heeren, however, flanked by his Bronze Sentinels, argued that the war was not over until Feathisia got rid of every last traitor. He was charismatic in a way only an insane griffon really could be and many in the manor got swept up in the moment to support him. In the moment of truth..."

feat.51.t:0 "The New Grand Duke"
feat.51.d:0 "The Knights' Hall in De Vleugels was the ceremonial centre of the Grand Duchy of Feathisia since the title was created. Over centuries of Griffonian history the building has been a hunting lodge, a feasting hall, a supply depot and barracks for a foreign army and a hall for ceremony. Grand Duke Gerlach had the Article 1 of the constitution of Feathisia painted on the huge hearth of the west side. The text was made invisible by a huge banner of the Feathisian military for today's ceremony, the ascension of Grand Duke Karel Everhard I.\n\nThe noblegriffon was not related by blood to the late Grand Duke, having married into the family via Gerlach's cousin. What he lacked in legitimacy Karel made up for in charisma, however. Before his marriage, he was sharply criticised for a brief membership in a Reformisten organisation before his arrival in Feathisia. That criticism fainted quickly, as the ducal marriage provided much needed relief at the height of an economic crisis. Karel Everhard captured the hearts of the Feathisians by learning the language and showing himself to be a capable pilot, general and quick with words.\n\nWhen Gerlach was assassinated, it was Karel Everhard who became the de facto head of the Weijermars family in Feathisia, with most other members staying muted in the conflict. The Jonkheer fought bravely in battle, flying every single model of Beakker aircraft to support the nationalists in the conflict, earning himself unrivalled popularity.\n\nSo, the Knights' Hall was filled for him, with dignitaries, generals and representatives of monarchies still friendly to Feathisia as Karel Everhard I took the oath of office in front of the grand ducal regalia. Even though radio caught the event live, as per tradition, royal heralds flew from the balustrade up through a ceiling window, speeding to all provinces of Feathisia to announce the start of the reign of Grand Duke Karel Everhard I."

feat.52.t:0 "The Death of Heeren"
feat.52.d:0 "Godfried Heeren, leader of the Bronzen Schildwachten and one of the major politicians within the ruling FNV party, was found dead this morning in his office. His corpse was riddled with bullets and a letter was found that accused him of treason against his own Bronze Sentinels. It turns out that even Godfried Heeren himself was afraid of the Bronze Sentinels, fearing he'd lose control of the ever growing paramilitary fanatics. And now he did.\n\nSentinel spokesgriffons tried to explain and shift the blame to others, framing it as an attempt to sow discord amongst the FNV. But it was Anton Moldernik who appeared on the radio the next evening. He was audibly angered at such a blatant murder against the principles of democracy. With a quivering voice, the FNV leader expressed his gratitude to the deceased Heeren, who, he claimed, realised his mistake of associating with the Schildwachten too late. Then, with righteous anger, Moldernik ordered the arrest of all Bronze Sentinel leaders live on radio and declared the organisation suspended. Many griffons secretly let out a sigh of relief, since Heeren's policies were considered extremist even by FNV standards. Heeren had been openly authoritarian and racist, something most Feathisians could not stomach. With the demise of the Sentinels, an even larger part of the population could now justify supporting the party to themselves."
feat.52.a:0 "Such a tragic demise."

feat.53.t:0 "The Great Purge"
feat.53.d:0 "It wasn't long after Heeren took full power in Feathisia that massive hysteria gripped the country. Flyers, posters, radio speeches and newspapers all added fuel to the fire that another communist revolution was imminent. Supposedly, ponies arrived from Stalliongrad to smuggle in weapons and other foreign states aligned with the red menace were also secretly supporting an artificial opposition.\n\nHow much of this was true, and how much of this Godfried Heeren made up, was impossible to tell, but the threat of foreign intervention stoked the fears of an already war-weary population. Heeren, of course, promised to act against any foreign infiltrators and communist conspirators, highlighting the pony threat in particular. So it was to the relief of many when Bronze Sentinel army trucks rounded up suspected traitors in all cities, along with most of the pony minorities. Instead of the jeers the Orangecloaks got before the civil war whenever they marched openly, the population, riled up into paranoid zealotry, cheered on the Bronze Sentinels as they kicked in the doors of suspected traitors and those ponies still left in Feathisia.\n\nThere was hardly any resistance as neighbours, friends or colleagues got rounded up and taken away to the Great Plains, far from the eyes of the public. There, most griffons were sentenced to forced labour, while most ponies faced summary execution. When news of the purge dawned upon Feathisia, most chose not to belief the worst stories as to satisfy their guilty conscience.\n\nAlthough some citizens protested against the purge, most noteworthy during a strike in Mirabelle, such actions were immediately and brutally suppressed. The griffons got the message, any opposition to Heeren's rule would be considered treason. With such a display of brutality, Heeren now held the country in his bronze claw, his commands obeyed unquestioned. His supporters revered him as the saviour of Feathisia, a larger-than-griffon ruler to take revenge on all those who opposed the FNV before. The rest of Feathisia was either too apathetic, too scared or too paralysed by guilt to intervene."

Although the FHP politicians mostly went quietly, the police had to drag the other politicians out of their offices. Some didn't believe that such a decree could be real and the first few minutes the politicians thought it was a bad joke. When the politicians and their staff realised the decree was real, chaos ensued.\n\nThe collective LDP party tried to occupy parliament and failed as police threatened to open fire on the harmonists. Meanwhile FNV Deputy Heeren got into a claw fight with a police officer and had to be dragged out by three policegriffs while he was screaming about betrayal. Gerben Kogchel, leader of the PvdA, was spotted carrying a suitcase with papers of his social security plans and some swore that there was a tear rolling down his face. Crowds of Feathisians from De Vleugels watched with unbelief as one by one, their representatives were kicked out of the parliament building. At the end of the day, the monument to Feathisian democracy stood empty, guarded by police officers."

Flanked by Rozenkamp and Stappenbeld, his more radical allies, the Labour leader announced the general strike. Giving a passionate speech about democracy and the right of the common griffon, he was interrupted by Rozenkamp, who laid out the plan for the Red Front. They would occupy the factories and the dockyards. The workers would starve the economy, which would force the Grand Duke into surrender."

feat.56.d:0 "Arjen Talonsley, long time minister and leader of the Liberaal Democratische Partij, headed a party conference today in De Vleugels. Many FHP members had joined him today and the harmonists decided on what to do. The party wasn't militant or controlled any factories like the reds did. They were not used to being stopped by police officers from exercising their basic rights. After a day of intense debate, votes were had on what to do. The party decided to form the Feathisian Liberation front and to follow the example of famous harmonists before them by protesting peacefully in any way possible. No noble, police officer or government worker would be able to cross the street, without being reminded that they were not working for a democratic state anymore."

The Barons of Vorst tot Vorst, some of the most influential generals in the army, sat across from him. They had finished planning their uprising. Heeren's Bronze Sentinels would engage the police and the Duke's loyalists in the streets, while the generals would try to prepare the soldiers for a coup, but at the least keep the military from crushing the resistance. The Front for the Restoration of the Fatherland, or the Fatherland Front for short, was born."

feat.58.d:0 "The past month or so, more and more of the liberal protesters were thrown into overcrowded cells. Feathisia was clearly not ready to deal with so many prisoners at once and the wardens were relieved to hear that the cells would soon be empty yet again. Last night, stages were erected, on which devices most Feathisians only knew from stories from more savage places on the world were assembled. Gallows. In the morning, the prisons were emptied and the inmates taken to the execution grounds.\n\nThe killings took all day, the liberals taking their punishment in grim silence. In Luxwingburg a policegriff puked on the stage, disgusted by what he had to do. In Grieslein, the first griffon that tried to do the deed collapsed unconscious then and there, his replacement was heard saying sorry to his victims, crying out loud until the tears simply stopped coming.

The nationalist Barons van Vorst tot Vorst were being judged for treason against the Grand Duke and the elder brother had decided to do the defence himself. Many such cases were had against soldiers the last few days, but this one was against two of the most well-known figures in the country. Both of them must have known the judge's verdict before the trial started, but it did not stop Herman to give a passionate plea. His voice commanded the room and not even the judge had the spirit to silence him. After an hour of lecturing the Feathisians on the values of their country and how his only crime had been patriotism, the general simply saluted the court, followed by his brother. Raising their voices, the two started to sing the age-old national anthem of the Grand Duchy, but the visitors were too scared to join in.\n\nAfter this display the room was silent while the judge seemed to hesitate, before he remembered his instructions and announced the verdict. Death by firing squad. It was rumoured that the generals personally shook claws with the soldiers that were chosen for the deed and commended them for their bravery, before silently facing their deaths."

The FNV knew that this was the heart of the Red Resistance and that if they did take the city, it would be a devastating blow to the morale of their enemies. Thus they massed forces from all over Feathisia to break into the city and seize the PvdA headquarters, from where the revolution was orchestrated.\n\nThe PvdA, meanwhile, was determined to hold on to the city. The inhabitants were proud to become a fortress against reactionaries and on the Central Grover Boulevard, communist leader Rozenkamp ordered a big banner to be placed, hanging over the city street; 'They shall not pass!'

Now Baron Herman van Vorst tot Vorst plans a decisive attack to beat back the militias that are holding the streets. The FNV general plans to use Bronze Sentinels and some of his most elite units to sneak through the forest surrounding the city and attack at night. With the city lit up by lights, it is hard to spot a griffon emerging from the dark forests. When he secures a foothold in the city, the general will order an artillery barrage on the far side of Luxwingburg to confuse the enemy into thinking a pincer move is in progress.\n\nThe general is quite confident in his abilities and his troops are eager to battle the looting hordes of socialists.

Regardless, Rima province has been dragged into the civil war. Although the city is being ruled from the university building by an impromptu workers council, the countryside has started to form brigades to take the city and put a halt to communist expansion in the state.

A final assault on the old ducal residence in De Vleugels has eliminated the PvdA's leadership. The civil war has radicalised supporters of the FNV party.

Edgar Pechvogel, a public servant for the ministry of finance has been chosen to lead the new government. He was undisputedly one of the figures that helped limit the effects of the economic crisis and all parties agreed that his approach was so neutral that he could not possibly hold any bias. In a rushed ceremony in what was left of the parliament building, mister Pechvogel was declared dictator of Feathisia and given power to do whatever it takes to win the war."

The small country used to be much larger in the past and using ancient claims, Romau decided this was the perfect time to win back some of their long lost land.\n\nWith the country embroiled in a civil war, there was no Feathisian soldier to stop this flagrant violation of our sovereignty. The conflict still continues, with or without Rima and with no end to the war in sight, it seems that Romau will face no repercussions in the near future."

feat.78.t:0 "Regicide in Griffenheim"
feat.78.d:0 "It hadn't been long since Emperor Grover V died. The citizens of Feathisia had barely begun to move on in a world where some regent may well control the Empire in the name of young Grover VI. All that changed when the news of the brute murder of the Child Emperor by parts of the Imperial military rippled through the Grand Duchy. There was no Grover left and Gabriela Eagleclaw was now technically the next in line to the throne. Ferdinand Dawnclaw, a dictator, had usurped the Empire.\n\nIn the evening candlelight wakes were held in every city and town in honour of Grover VI. Many cried, many others vowed that this could not go unpunished. Some still prayed for peace.\n\nThe next day, political scheming continued in earnest, there was no time for mourning with a power-hungry general at the gates. The so called Regency Debate had started since the death of the Sick Emperor, but had now exploded, with no griffon showing any true leadership. While the Grand Duke has locked himself in his Estate, privately grieving the death of his friend's son, the coalition of liberals and monarchists has broken in parliament. Dark times were ahead, and as long Feathisia remained disunited, the country could not stand against Dawnclaw."
feat.78.a:0 "No..."

feat.79.t:0 "Operation Red Star"
feat.79.d:0 "If there was one thing Feathisians loved doing, it was recording information. It was not a secret that the Feathisian government had updated lists on the whereabouts of most citizens and the use of every square meter of land. However, the need for organisation stretched far beyond the government itself, for better or for worse. When army trucks road up to the old PvdA headquarters, a stately building amidst brick working class homes, they soon found their prize hidden away in the now abandoned symbol of communism. The master ledger of party members, along with detailed information about their beliefs and even assessments on the probability of revolutionary thought.\n\nThis ledger was sent back to the military itself, which cross-referenced the information with civilian records. Soon the officers in charge had compiled a list of suspected socialist agitators to arrest. Of course, it would be most disturbing if the arrests were to happen by heavily armed soldiers, so it was decided to let the civilian and military police handle the urban arrests, while letting the rijksveldwachters police the countryside.\n\nThousands of griffons were arrested from all over the country. Unionists, former local representatives of the PvdA and left-wing journalists were all considered possible threats to the peace. The arrests almost all happened without incident, with most of the reds thinking the end of the war meant they were safe. One incident happened in Mirabelle, where the communists were tipped off by the previous raid on the old headquarters and where the PvdA still held significant support. There, some misguided workers barricaded the old headquarters, their old leaders inside. The griffons formed a living chain around the building as the police approached, determined to obstruct justice.\n\nThe police, however, was not the police Feathisians were used to. The police of de-escalation, negotiation and friendly conversation was no more, replaced by veterans of the civil war. Baton and gun in claw, the griffons punched a way through the workers, escalating the tension into a brawl for which the workers were woefully under-equipped. Many onlookers saw the police break the blockade and drag out the socialist leaders inside, including famed communist journalist Bernhardt Stappenbeld.\n\nOperation Red Star was a success."
feat.79.a:0 "They will be given a fair trial. In due time."

feat.80.t:0 "The Voting Security Act"
feat.80.d:0 "'De Wet voor de Waarborg van de Fetisische Democratie' in full, The Law for Safeguarding Feathisian Democracy, was quickly dubbed the Voting Security Act by both supporters and opponents. Like often in the history of law, an inconspicuous name hid a monumental change. Rushed through the emergency parliament in the militarily-controlled state, the public and media were not given much time to react to the proposal at all.\n\nArticle 1 discussed the powers of 'the state of siege', as martial law was called in Feathisian legal speak. These powers were granted not to a civilian government, but to a military one. The rest of the law explained what all this would entail; Firstly, the suspension of any and all elections in Feathisia, with representatives to be determined by governmental appointment. Secondly, an approval process for any controversial publications. These publications would have to be proven not to be unconducive for national security. Thirdly, the option for prosecutors to have civilian cases be brought before a military court. Fourthly, the prohibition of labour strikes and the restriction of protests.\n\nIn a written explanation for the law, the military government cited stability and safety, the looming threat of war and griffonpower shortages in the police force and the judicial system. Naturally, the government was committed to appointing a diverse representation and to allow free speech as much as possible until the current crisis had abated.\n\nThis flimsy excuse did not satisfy many liberals and socialists, however, and they flocked to the streets of the cities, crying about 'constitutional outrage'. The papers did not report on them. Two weeks later, only a few griffons remained, the protest starved by lack of attention. Nothing much changed for the average griffon, which was exactly as planned. On the surface, all parts of the state seemed to run fine. Regular debates took place in all levels of legislature and civilian courts deliberated faithfully, dutifully reported on by local and national press. But in reality, the military now controlled all affairs of state with an iron claw."
feat.80.a:0 "Rest assured citizens, this is for your own safety."

feat.81.t:0 "The Grand Restoration"
feat.81.d:0 "Campaign rallies, flags in party colours and sharp debates on the future of the country. Elections returned to Feathisia and the people went to the voting booth excitedly. Even though many a town hall was still surrounded by scaffolding and there were worries about threats from abroad, the very act of voting lifted the spirits of the griffons.\n\nFrom the onset, Anton Moldernik's FNV, the winners of the civil war, were the favourites, expected to deliver the prime minister for any new cabinet. This did not prevent the conservative FHP and the liberals from running their own campaigns along with regional and other minor parties. The PvdA boycotted the election after openly communist candidates were prevented from running by the Electoral Board. Most griffons considered the labour party sore losers for not participating in 'the celebration of democracy.'\n\nA coalition of the FNV and several minor parties managed to gain a majority and a coalition agreement was soon struck. At the first day of the new session of parliament, Prime Minister Moldernik gave a rousing speech about the democratic tradition of Feathisia and how despite threats from all sides, the free spirit of the Feathisian people persevered. He wished all members of parliament well, both the members of the coalition and the honourable opposition. The prime minister's speech was received by applause from the younger members of parliament and by the traditional tapping of the claw on the tables by the elder members.\n\nAs Moldernik, the new titan of Feathisian politics, left the chamber to leave the legislature to its job, a sense of normalcy finally returned to the country."
feat.81.a:0 "Democracy is a Feathisian tradition!"

feat.82.t:0 "There Is No Alternative"
feat.82.d:0 "With democrats and socialists removed from the picture, only one major obstacle remained to Heeren's full authority. Out of a misplaced sense of honour and loyalty to Weijermars and Grover, the nobility of Feathisia defied the leader at every opportunity. This caused a split in the nationalists of Feathisia, with the FNV's supporters, whose ranks swelled in the war, supporting Heeren and the FHP's old supporters, along with remnants of the liberals, putting their faith in what remains of the nobility and the return of the Weijermars family.\n\nAgain, Heeren used the media to his full advantage in eliminating this threat. Editorials reframed Feathisia's past in a new light. The nobility were the puppets of Griffenheim, used to manipulate the people to fight Grover's wars all over the continent, while Feathisia was plucked clean of her wealth by the imperial tax collectors.\n\nThen, the present was reimagined. Papers that once wrote of the Grand Duke's reforms and grace, now called him an impotent slave to Grover, who sold Feathisia's freedom for a kiss from Duchess Eagleclaw. The writings got ever worse over time. Raging articles that claimed that finally, Feathisia had a chance to rid itself of the chains of monarchy. To purge its connection to the fat and decadent parasites leeching from the hardworking Feathisian. Those leeches, who in the end, did nothing when the red vermin was looting the cities and pillaging the countryside. The Weijermars family was pulled through the mud, being blamed for every death of the civil war, for all those who live in poverty and for the decline of Feathisia's ancient borders.\n\nSuch a relentless propaganda campaign started to affect the griffons of Feathisia, slowly but surely. Even though not all the accusations were believed, doubt and confusion over these new facts still rooted up the respect for the monarchy in the common griffon's mind, leaving only Heeren as an alternative. "
feat.82.a:0 "We must purge the leeches from society!"

feat.83.t:0 "The Mirabelle Proclamation"
feat.83.d:0 "It was a bold turn of the FNV party to support the creation of the Feathisian Republic. Feathisia had always been a monarchy, in fact, it had fought fiercely against the Republican revolutionaries in the past. But post-civil war Feathisia had changed dramatically. In many parts of the country, especially those that were occupied by socialists, the nobility was gone. Except for a few brave officers, many nobles did not fight and the official heir to the Weijermars family, Stefan Weijermars, was an art collector who barely had an interest in ruling.\n\nSo it was with the official consent of Stefan Weijermars and the approval of [Root.Getleader] that the Weijermars family gave up their titles, transforming Feathisia into a Republic and replacing the constitution with the 'Statute for the Republic'. This all came to a head in what would be known as the Mirabelle Proclamation.\n\nThe old socialist stronghold of Mirabelle was packed to the brim as speeches were expected from the new government. Audio recorders, film cameras and eyes were aimed at the balcony of the city hall when a small figure appeared. It was Stefan Weijermars, Gerlach's cousin and until recently, heir to his titles. He seemed to start shaking when he saw the enormous crowd that came to see him, as he read a carefully prepared speech straight from the paper. In it, the noble nervously explained that he was of the opinion that the people did not support the monarchy anymore and that therefore the contract between monarch and people was broken. He again renounced all titles and pronounced his support for the Republic. Stefan almost seemed relieved when the words were out, the burden of his cousin's legacy removed from his shoulders.\n\nA thunderous applause erupted from the crowd to support the shy griffon, who quickly turned around and flew back inside the building only to be replaced by the FNV party leader. [Root.GetLeader] was warmly welcomed with cheers of support, a first time for the red city. He explained briefly that the FNV would replace the title of Grand Duke with that of Grand President and that, of course, he would humbly carry out that duty. The news spread like wildfire throughout the country, causing most to celebrate and others to pray for Stefan Weijermars, their Grand Duke. But the cheerful celebrations from the crowd in Mirabelle did not cease until [Root.GetLeader] was long gone."

feat.84.d:0 "Among the many stories shared by sailors, particularly Feathisian ones, few are as oft told as the story of the Flying Feathisian.\n\nA trade ship of great renown which operated in a century long past, this vessel was commanded by one simply known as Van der Lecken. A griff of unusual stubbornness and pride, he gained fame for his quick journeys from Skyfall to Kirinia. Just like the wind in his sails was the speed his wealth increased, which earned him bitter rivals. Whispers arose that der Lecken was in a concord with Maar, for no other Hindiagriff could sail through the treacherous straits of Macawia. Many agree, however, the captain was a tough old sea wolf and commanded the utmost respect of his crew.\n\nYet this grizzled admiral did not want to admit that the passing years have been cruel, nor yield to the overbearing storms. He would continue to sail against the highest waves again and again. It is said that after repeatedly being headed by the wind, the captain took the deck and swore against all manner of deities both actual and fictional, that he would reach the land of the Kirins or be lost at sea forever. Such hubris did not go unnoticed, and der Lecken and his crew are told to be eternally wandering the oceans, bringing misfortune and foul weather to any other creature who sights the Flying Feathisian."

### Leader Descriptions ###
FEA_gerlach_desc:0 "Born in the year 960 in the Ducal Estate just outside de Vleugels as the eldest son and heir apparent to the Grand Duchy of Feathisia, Gerlach has made a name for himself ever since he ascended the throne. A patient and diligent griffon, the Grand Duke immediately started reforming the Grand Duchy, which was, like the rest of the Griffonian Empire, still reeling from the aftermath of the Republican revolution in Griffenheim. Co-leading a committee with Rudolph Thorbeak, the leading liberal politician in Feathisia at the time, they strengthened the constitution and brought stable democracy to Feathisia. Although the Feathisians had to get used to their new rights, it only took a few years for liberty to blossom and all sorts of parties to pop up.\n\nOne of his most controversial moments saw him blocking the liberal democratic party from government until they expelled any republican sentiments. The Grand Duke explained that the Gods crowned the nobility and that the natural order of things had to be preserved, an attitude Gerlach inherited from his father, who helped fight the Republican uprising.\n\nEven though the country was doing fine, Gerlach never stopped working hard, championing the abolishment of public executions, leading industrial change and whenever possible, supporting Emperor Grover. All his hard work has left the Grand Duke without a wife, however, some griffons saying he gets awkward and shy alone with any possible candidate. The Silent Duke, as his subjects lovingly call him, will continue to give his all for his country, quietly praying his people continue to prosper under his rule and make him proud."

Now that the Grand Duke is married to Duchess Gabriela Eagleclaw, he has doubled his efforts, now in the forefront of Griffonian politics. The Silent Duke, as his subjects lovingly call him, will continue to give his all for his country and now the rest of Griffonia, if the gods give him the chance."

With the emperor dead and the system, he so carefully built on the verge of collapse, an attempt on his life saw the Grand Duke's last faith in the politicians he allowed to rule fade away. The Grand Duke took full control of the country, now that his old friends betrayed him. He would do anything to protect Feathisia and eliminate all griffons who would stop him."
FEA_kogchel_desc:0 "Gerben Kogchel was born as the son of a bank clerk in De Vleugels, the Feathisian capital. Even though his father died when he was young, Gerben would initially follow his lead, working for a local bank. From studying finances, he quickly learned that the Feathisian state could do better. Many griffons were living in poverty or uncertainty, only a bad illness away from hunger. Distressed by the lack of protection for everygriffon, Kogchel joined the PvdA to fight for worker protection. His genuine empathy and drive to make Feathisia a better place saw him grow popular on the local level, where he became the first PvdA mayor for de Vleugels, which saw the city improving care for the poorest.\n\nHis newfound popularity reached across party lines and it was said that Kogchel had a longstanding correspondence with the Grand Duke of Feathisia. When Kogchel entered parliament after winning a leadership election in the labour party, opposition to his plans stiffened. Both the Liberal Democrats and the ducal party resisted his plans and there was even less of a chance the FNV would cooperate. Still, Kogchel laboured on without resenting his political opponents, trying ever so hard to change Feathisia for the better.\n\nThe social democrat's effort all seemed to crash down with the advent of the civil war, as more violent and pessimistic forces took over the country. However, with Kogchel at the helm, the more moderate griffons never lost hope for a better tomorrow. Personally, the social democrat leader managed to curb the worst excesses of violence against civilians. Kogchel's briefcase full of social reforms became a symbol of hope all on its own, as the politician refused to part with them under any circumstances, to remind himself what he was fighting for. Now after so much death and destruction, it was time to rebuild. Gerben Kogchel gave Feathisia a second chance, hoping to rekindle democracy in a socialist light, to heal the wounds caused by the civil war and mend the country's broken society. However, some are worried that the idealistic griffon would leave the already battered state vulnerable in this uncertain age."
FEA_rozenkamp_desc:0 "Herman Rozenkamp was born in Mirabelle, the bustling industrial city in the northeast of Feathisia. Along with his brother Reinoud, the two barely scraped by as children of the working poor. Determined to escape the fate of their parents, both of them enlisted into the army as cannoneers under a young lieutenant van Voorst tot Voorst. The officer taught them not only how to shoot a cannon, but how to shoot a cannon and be a patriot while doing it. The death of their father in a workplace accident made the Rozenkamps leave the military, however. Herman had to take care of his mother and took his father's job. There he saw the difference between the noblegriffon's speeches about love for the country and the reality of factory work. Herman would change it all.\n\nThe Rozenkamp brothers joined the local PvdA, where they were initially suspected as former soldiers. Soon enough, their energy and oratory power got noticed by the party leadership and the brothers rose through the ranks. However, instead of boring party congresses and the administrative work which his brother spent more and more time on, Herman went back to the factories and sometimes even to soldiers. There he found fertile ground for his own brand of communism, called Rozenkampism.\n\nWith the economic crisis raging through Feathisia, Rozenkamp riled against everything. The nobility, the Triarchy and the weak politicians (sometimes his own party wasn't even spared). He blamed Griffenheim and Skyfall, Equestria and the Archons. But as the political instability reached the breaking point of civil war, Rozenkamp was ready for battle. When the red banner flew over De Vleugels, it were Rozenkampists who planted it there. And it will be Rozenkamp who will lead Feathisia to glory. For the Fatherland and for the Revolution!"
FEA_heeren_desc:0 "Godfried Heeren was born in Rottendedam to a middle-class family of shopkeepers. He was the world to his parents and the bright young griffon had everything his heart desired, but at school it was already he clear Heeren was problematic. He'd sometimes get overwhelmed by uncontrollable rage and woe to the kid that stood in his way if he did. Growing older, the griffon's way with words and his rage grew into an uncanny sort of magnetism and he easily attracted friends whose slavish attitude helped inflate his ego. Of course, like so many a youth before him, young Heeren thought he had politics all figured out. It was very easy. There were two griffons in Feathisia fit to rule the country, the first, Count Gerlach, foolishly gave his power away in pursuit of cheap popularity. The other griffon would be Godried Heeren himself, naturally.\n\nHeeren joined the Orangecloaks, a paramilitary group training in the middle of the Great Plains. There his political thought evolved further and he found that his charisma served him well as he rose to a leadership position in the radical group. He quickly adopted the group's anti-pony attitudes and sheer hatred for socialism. When the group failed to win any seats in parliament, Heeren merged the group with the FNV party, negotiating his way into the spotlight of Feathisia's political elite. Afterwards, Heeren and the FNV at large profited from the crisis crippling the country, as the jobless proved loyal new voters.\n\nWhen the Regent Debate busted the coalition government, Moldernik, ever the pragmatist, tried to negotiate a coalition with the PvdA, but Heeren already prepared for a war. He aroused so much suspicion amongst his supporters that the deal busted and Feathisia went to war. Now Heeren was in charge of Feathisia. Those who know him best, doubt this would finally soothe his anger and satisfy Heeren's hunger for power."
FEA_edgar_desc:0 "Edgar Pechvogel led an unassuming but productive life. Born in a small town near to the capital to a family of bureaucrats, it seemed that Edgar would follow his parents' clawsteps. An interest in numbers and a sense of duty led him to the growing ranks of the ministry of finance. Some may find the work soul grinding, but for Edgar the numbers meant something. Every time the economy grew a little more, it meant more happy families and that money saved on military expenses could be used to fund healthcare that could safe somegriffon's life. His intrinsic motivation and his frankly brilliant work on the technical aspects of economics saw him rise as quickly through the ranks as the rigid structure of Feathisian bureaucracy allowed.\n\nWhen the crisis hit and the 1007 budget was to be presented, a true battle took place between the ministries of economic affairs and the ministry of finance. Pechvogel tried to champion a free-market based budget, while the idiots of EA tried to intervene in the market. Either way, the financial crisis exploded into a political crisis and a civil war.\n\nThe war kept going, while what was left of the civilian government tried to guard De Vleugels. And the wheels of bureaucracy kept turning, with most public servants having a sense of loyalty to their department over any of the warring factions. But alarming news came from Griffenheim as the Imperials marched into Feathisia!\n\nA few days later, a group of soldiers, some wearing caps with a red star on them while others wore Feathisian military outfits, barged into what remained of parliament. Edgar Pechvogel was there, delivering some paperwork personally. The soldiers, in surprising harmony, interrogated everygriffon present, leading them straight to Edgar Pechvogel. After hearing of his ability and crosschecking the list of griffons both parties hated, the soldiers decided that Edgar would do. Not much later, the public servant got inaugurated as the head of the National Salvation Committee. As the numbers turned from money to casualties, Edgar's vivid imagination seems more of a burden than a blessing. Still, Pechvogel would set himself to the present task, doing his best, as he had all his life."
FEA_moldernik_desc:0 "Born as the son of a manager in the Aiwle oil business, Anton Moldernik got the best education money could buy, namely a social science degree at Bruma university in Yale. Both his parents were part of the FNV party and Anton would become a member at an early age. Intelligent and ruthless, Moldernik managed to get ahead in the party and to get himself on the candidacy list, securing his election victory in Aiwle. In parliament, he became the party spokesperson on agricultural affairs, a topic the FNV's main competitor, the FHP, was strong in. Nevertheless, Moldernik managed to impress the populace in debates, presenting his monarchist counterparts as spineless liberals.\n\nAfter about a decade in politics, Moldernik got elevated to the level of party leader, which he would remain until the Regency crisis broke out. With tensions flaring up, Moldernik sought to strike a deal with Kogchel. Much to his dismay, the deal faltered and his comfortable life shattered into a civil war. It took the nationalist some time to adjust to the new situation, but the fascist grew into his role as leader of the now openly authoritarian FNV. Now that the guns are silent and with his power reaffirmed, Anton Moldernik faces the task of redefining Feathisia and giving meaning to the lives of its people."
FEA_stappenbeld_desc:0 "Bernhardt Stappenbeld grew up in Rottendedam, the port city of Feathisia. Born with an inherent curiosity and a quick mind, the griffon started writing from a young age. Although his fiction was of a mediocre quality, his prose was good enough for the work of a journalist. Adventurous, the Feathisian accepted a job offer to report on stories from Stalliongrad. Over the years, his readers may have found the tone of his stories changing. Critical at first, the griffon living amongst ponies mocked the ponies of the Severyana for revolting against such a benevolent ruler like Celestia.\n\nSlowly but surely, the accounts of failing agricultural plans and empty store shelves made way for intricate essays on Stalliongradian communism and then what his critics called straight up love letters to socialism. When the journalist went home and joined the PvdA on the day of his return, they found a changed griffon. A sceptical journalist crossed the sea, returning as a socialist ideologue. His teachings, brought over from Stalliongrad, attracted a split following; intelligentsia and self-proclaimed revolutionaries on the one claw, and actual workers on the other.\n\nWith revolution raging in Feathisia, Stappenbeld's ranks grew enormously as his prophecy of class struggle indeed became true. The journalist showed himself a capable leader, eclipsing the social democrats in the PvdA and managing to get into party leadership. Now Bernhardt Stappenbeld looked over the ocean once more, ready to put theory into practice."
FEA_vorst_desc:0 "Born into the prestigious Van Vorst tot Vorst family, Herman was the heir to their land. Herman carried his heritage with him wherever he went, learning the traits that defined a good noblegriffon from school and at home. Staunch, conservative, brave and strategic, he graduated top of his class in the officer academy showing that a noble birth did not mean a lack of merit. Serving in many posts, including a fateful while as an artillery officer, the baron became popular among his troops for his no-nonsense attitude and straight up patriotism.\n\nFrom the army, Herman learned the value of hierarchy, of tradition and of the institution of the military. As he climbed through the ranks, he started to flirt with the FNV party, a highly unorthodox choice for a noblegriffon. But the Ducal party had grown spineless, giving to many concessions to weak doves who wanted total equality. When the system broke down, the Baron and soldiers loyal to him stepped in to fight on the side of the nationalists.\n\nHowever, during the fighting, Van Vorst tot Vorst discovered that his newfound allies were little better, discarding tradition in favour of something radically new. They had to be stopped as well and the Baron did stop them. Now the military rules Feathisia, guarding the people against any threat, both from the inside and from abroad. The House of Van Vorst tot Vorst stands victorious and vigilant against threats both foreign and domestic."

FEA_stefan_desc:0 "The cousin of the more famous Gerlach IV, Stefan Weijermars lived in relative obscurity as a curator to De Vleugels art museum. His true passion never lay in politics, although he shared the same enthusiasm for art as his cousin did for running a nation. Described as an introvert, only coming to life when the conversation comes to his passion, it was easy to forget the griffon's lineage when meeting him. Everything changed with the death of his cousin. The Weijermars family scattered when the civil war began, some leaving the country successfully, others shot by marauding Rozenkampists. Stefan was hidden by the museum staff amongst some of the most precious artworks. Only when the civil war died down, with the military securing victory, did Stefan come out.\n\nThe Baron's soldiers located Weijermars and after a conversation behind closed doors, he decided to take the title of Grand Duke of Feathisia. Whether he agreed in an effort to soften the military rule over the country, or because Stefan I was indeed a supporter of military stratocracy is up to speculation, but he must have no illusions of ever obtaining the power or influence his deceased cousin once wielded."
FEA_talonsley_desc:0 "A social and moderate liberal and beloved prime minister of Feathisia, Arjen Talonsley has led the country through an age of gradual destabilization.  A griffon of compromises and normalcy, he is not above negotiations and solutions where 'everygriffon wins'.\n\nTalonsley took over the LDP after an incident known as the 'Night of Molenaer', after his predecessor as ruler of the LDP. Molenaer had won a stunning election victory against the monarchist FHP party, but the conservatives threatened to blow up negotiations for a government unless the LDP would openly denounce republicanism. Later on, it was proven that this demand came directly from the Grand Duke, but that night, the LDP was forced to choose between principle or pragmatism. Molenaer chose principles, but in an internal party vote, he was rejected by a narrow margin and Talonsley became head of the party, forging the LDP-FHP coalition. Molenaer left the party and Talonsley lost much of the republican vote to the PvdA, but he had his government. In time Arjen Talonsley and the LDP would shown that monarchy and liberty were not opposed values, but actually complement each other nicely. His free market approach to may see his support decline amongst the average griffon, however, especially during a crisis."

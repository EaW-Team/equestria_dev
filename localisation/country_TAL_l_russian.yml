TAL_duchess_ginerva_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 13th of May, 965 in Talononte\n\n§YBiography§!: Ginevra di Chiazbini was born the eldest child of Duke Giovanni III of Talouse. She grew up in the comfort of the Ducal Palace, and was mostly carefree, consuming the knowledge given to her by her mentors. At an early age, she demonstrated a level of unmatched decisiveness, as well as her infamous temper, which greatly contrasted her patient and naive father. Her pleasant life was turned upside down by the Falcor War, which raged from 985-989 ALB. As the war progressed, she saw her father’s health rapidly deteriorate, alongside the nation’s economy. After the war’s end, there was a glimmer of hope for Ginevra when she married her lifelong sweetheart, the handsome Victor di Altomondi. This time of good feelings was short-lived however, as in 992, her father died of a heart attack, and the young griffoness was crowned Duchess. Ever since then, she has been a staunch pacifist, denouncing war and its horrors. Even though she was a pacifist, her belligerent constitution remained, being further incensed by the post-war economic issues. During the strike of 1003, she famously stormed into Parliament, demanding that a resolution be passed, and quickly. While this garnered the support of the common folk, she alienated parts of the upper echelons of Talousian society, who viewed it as barbaric and improper for a lady of such high standing. Today, the Duchess is mostly well-liked, and many workers herald her as a people’s monarch. However, trouble is brewing in Talouse, and it remains to be seen whether Ginevra will lead her family’s ancient legacy to greatness, or be its downfall. \n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

### Focuses ###
#LRN Voting Focuses
TAL_a_new_start:0 "Elections of 1007"
TAL_a_new_start_desc:0 "Talouse, a land once noble and wealthy, has succumbed to corruption and poverty. The economy continues to falter, and the population grows restless. While Paltori's cabinet has enacted some reforms, many feel that they are not enough, putting forward their own visions for Talouse. With the elections fast approaching, only one of these designs for the small nation will make it out on top."
TAL_vote_for_LRN:0 "Support the LRN"
TAL_vote_for_LRN_desc:0 "The Lega per il Restauro Nazionale (LRN) is one of the more radical factions in Talousian politics. Headed by the eccentric, yet charismatic, Amilcare Fetivola, the party seeks to eradicate what they perceive as the corruptions of modernity, and restore the institutions of ancient Talonsia, a successor of the Arantigan Empire that once ruled over Talouse."
TAL_speakout_against_other_partiesandmonarchy_LRN:0 "Denounce Our Rivals"
TAL_speakout_against_other_partiesandmonarchy_LRN_desc:0 "The LRN has been a laughing stock for the corrupt bigwigs and unionists for decades. We must right these slanders, and show the commoners the monsters that have run this country into the ground."
TAL_promote_old_language_and_culture:0 "Remind the People"
TAL_promote_old_language_and_culture_desc:0 "Our ancient ways were glorious, and once brought us great power. However, they have been lost and forgotten and it is up to us to remind the people of what they have lost."
TAL_a_glourious_future:0 "A Glorious Future"
TAL_a_glourious_future_desc:0 "Many griffs doubt our intentions, thinking us, at best, loons. We must convince them that we have their best intentions at heart and that we wish to lead Talouse to the glorious future it deserves."
TAL_by_any_means_necessary:0 "Secure the Ballot"
TAL_by_any_means_necessary_desc:0 "The LRN is not one of the large parties of Talouse. We lack both corporate backing and mainstream attention. If we want a shot at victory, we must use all methods possible to secure it. \n\n§RYou must keep an eye on your Decisions otherwise the path for an LRN victory becomes harder.§!"
TAL_recieve_funds_from_supporters:0 "Donations From Supporters"
TAL_recieve_funds_from_supporters_desc:0 "The LRN is not a corrupt political machine, with billions to spend on a campaign. As such, we will rely on donations from our generous supporters, which is the way things should be."
#PC Voting Focuses
TAL_vote_for_PC:0 "Support the PC"
TAL_vote_for_PC_desc:0 "The Partito Conservatore (PC) is one of Talouse's oldest political parties, and was once at the forefront of Talousian politics. However, the party has lost steam in recent years, known only for its appeal to seniors. The party prides itself on championing traditional values and maintaining good relations with Wingbardy and the rest of the Karthinian Pact."
TAL_promote_PC:0 "Promote the Party"
TAL_promote_PC_desc:0 "For the past decade, the party's popularity has been on a noticeable decline. If we want any shot at victory, we must promote our party and our values and spread the word so that people may know that the PC is not yet lost."
TAL_give_speeches_PC:0 "Speeches and Rallies"
TAL_give_speeches_PC_desc:0 "To restore the people's faith in our party, we will host a series of rallies across the nation. We will travel from city to city, and give speeches to rouse the people's spirit and secure their vote. As an added benefit, we can use this as an opportunity to throw some shade at the FLT and weaken their hold over the commonfolk."
TAL_recieve_boomer_funding:0 "Collect Civilian Funding"
TAL_recieve_boomer_funding_desc:0 "As the years have gone by, our voter base has come to largely consist of senior citizens that dote fondly on post-Imperial Talouse. While this has somewhat tarnished our party's reputation, we can use this to our advantage. Considering most of our supporters are wealthy pensioners, we can rekindle their nostalgia for our golden days to collect sufficient funding for our campaign."
TAL_denounce_the_other_parties:0 "Decry the Opposition"
TAL_denounce_the_other_parties_desc:0 "The number of opposition parties has grown since the end of the Falcor War. These radicals seek nothing but the total destruction of Talouse's values and diplomatic relations. We must show the people that they have been misled by these extremists and that Talouse must return to the ways of tradition, and embrace her position on the global stage."
TAL_donate_to_good_causes:0 "Donate to Charities"
TAL_donate_to_good_causes_desc:0 "One of the values our party espouses is generosity. To that end, we will donate some of our campaign money to good charities, not only to support noble causes that we believe in, but to also demonstrate our dedication to upholding our values, and those of our forefathers."
#PL Voting Focuses
TAL_vote_for_PL:0 "Support the PL"
TAL_vote_for_PL_desc:0 "The Partito Liberale (PL), which had secured the Parliament in 1005, has been the leading party in Talousian politics recently. Led by the well-loved Marco Paltori, the party has been pushing for reform, advocating for greater economic freedom and increased protection for workers. With the Duchess' support, it is well on its way to bringing real change to Talouse."
TAL_rally_the_supporters:0 "Rally Our Supporters"
TAL_rally_the_supporters_desc:0 "As the election gets underway, it is vital for the party to reach out to its members across the nation. By rallying our supporters, we can ensure a high turnout of pro-PL voters, and secure our re-election."
TAL_allocate_funding_to_social_programs:0 "Fund Social Programs"
TAL_allocate_funding_to_social_programs_desc:0 "The PL is the wealthiest political organization in all of Talouse, with millions of idols coming in from public donations and corporate backers. With all of this wealth in our possession, we can afford to allocate some of it to fund social programs to aid the lower classes. This would serve to improve the party's opinion in the eyes of both the lower classes and our current voter base."
TAL_promote_harmonic_ideals:0 "Promote Our Ideals"
TAL_promote_harmonic_ideals_desc:0 "Over the past decade, radical beliefs have spread through Talouse, and extremist groups are becoming more and more popular. We must use our platform to spread our ideals of liberty and equality across the nation, and speak out against the spread of extremist organizations and their beliefs."
TAL_support_monarchy_and_parliment:0 "Uphold Our Institutions"
TAL_support_monarchy_and_parliment_desc:0 "In recent years, support for the monarchy and the Parliament, especially, has declined from a combination of insufficient action to address the Falcor War's fallout and extremist rhetoric. While these institutions aren't perfect, they provide stability for the nation, and, if run properly, can be very effective. As such, we must endorse these government bodies, and show our support for these vital institutions."
TAL_aid_to_those_in_need:0 "Aid the Needy"
TAL_aid_to_those_in_need_desc:0 "Ever since the end of the Falcor War, Talouse has seen an increase in poverty, unemployment, and homelessness. Starving griffs wander the streets, scraping by on donations from kind strangers. This state of affairs is appalling. We will use some of our campaign funding, as well as public donations, to launch welfare programs to aid those in need. This will provide a long-term benefit to the economy and our party."
#FLT Voting Focuses
TAL_vote_for_FLT:0 "Support the FLT"
TAL_vote_for_FLT_desc:0 "The Fronte Laburista Talusiano (FLT) has spearheaded the Talousian labour movement since the end of the Falcor War over 20 years ago. The front consists of a coalition between the urban syndicalist faction and the Highland communalist faction. Though the coalition is uneasy at times, its goal of drastic economical, societal and political reform in pursuit of the workers' liberation keeps it together."
TAL_unite_the_party:0 "Unify the Front"
TAL_unite_the_party_desc:0 "Even though the FLT seeks to liberate Talouse's workers, the two factions disagree on how to achieve it. Disagreements and factionalism have weakened the coalition, and something must be done to alleviate this, lest the front collapse all together. To that end, we will organize meetings and other events to promote unity in the front, and ensure that election goes over smoothly."
TAL_speak_out_against_PL_PC_LRN_monarchy:0 "Expose the Oppressors"
TAL_speak_out_against_PL_PC_LRN_monarchy_desc:0 "The people of Talouse have been hoodwinked by the bourgeois oppressors into supporting their capitalist regime. This has gone on for far too long! The people must be shown the corruption of their government, the hypocrisy of the PL and PC, and the destructive madness of the LRN. The commongriffs will see the rot that surrounds them and join together to bring it down."
TAL_promote_communist_ideals:0 "Further Our Manifesto"
TAL_promote_communist_ideals_desc:0 "To secure the vote, we must enlighten the Talousian voters, and inspire them to join the revolutionary struggle. To ensure our message is heard far and wide, we will produce a manifesto that displays the front's core values and display it in every town across the nation. That way, the people will know of our ideals and our dedication to their liberation."
TAL_do_anything_to_win:0 "Ensure Our Victory"
TAL_do_anything_to_win_desc:0 "The front has many enemies, waiting for an opportunity to sabotage it. As such, we must always remain vigilant, and do whatever is necessary to ensure that the revolution succeeds. \n\n§RYou must keep an eye on your Decisions otherwise the path for an FLT victory becomes harder.§!"
TAL_worker_union_strikes:0 "Organize Miner Strikes"
TAL_worker_union_strikes_desc:0 "The front represents the industrial labourers of Talouse, as well as her miners. We must stand in solidarity with the latter, who have been exploited ruthlessly for decades. We will begin a series of small strikes and march in the streets to show our devotion to the miners' cause and our intolerance for the oppression of the proletariat."
#PC Main Tree
TAL_PC_start:0 "PC Victory"
TAL_PC_start_desc:0 "Against all odds, the PC has seemingly rebounded from its decline, and has managed to achieve victory in the election, reclaiming the Parliament from the PL. The party will now dedicate itself towards the preservation of Talouse's values and its rightful place as a member of the Karthinian Pact."

talouse.1.t:0 "Fetivola's Speech"
talouse.1.d:0 ""I confess that in these times, I weep for Talouse. I weep, for it pains me to see our great nation brought low by the incompetence of our so-called leaders." At the LRN rally in Chiazbeacle, Amilcare Fetivola addressed his enraptured audience. Despite the party being at the fringes of Talousian politics, a surprising number of devoted supporters had turned out to show their dedication to Fetivola and the LRN. "Those prominent griffons all bear responsibility for our sad state of affairs, as it was their moral degeneration that made it possible."\n\n"It was the treachery of Emmanuel Talnara, who asks workers to forgo their proud national identity in favour of an imaginary class identity." Fetivola raised a finger for each political rival he listed off. "It was the small-minded cowardice of Antonio di Colliverde, who is content to maintain our nation's exploitation and humiliation. Most of all, it was the avarice of our Prime Minister. Marco Paltori has proven himself willing to sell out the interests of Talouse in exchange for gifts of gold to him and his corporate friends!" The crowd booed fiercely at the mention of Paltori.\n\n"The fact is, our Parliament is infested with unpatriotic griffons and their despicable ilk. As this institution succumbs to corruption and incompetence, our nation is served poorly by its monarch. Duchess Ginevra is a weak ruler, clearly out of her depth and incapable of rising to meet the current challenge. Such is the sad state of Talouse." Fetivola shook his head. "I don't know about you, but I've had enough! Are you content to live your lives as Wingbardian lapdogs?" In response, a deafening shout of "No!" came from the crowd. "Then vote LRN, and together we will forge a new Talouse to regain our lost glory!" Fetivola raised his fist in the air to wild cheers from his supporters."

talouse.2.t:0 "The Forgotten Legacy"
talouse.2.d:0 "In the Peckreit lodge of the Falcor Veterans of Talouse, Amilcare Fetivola shook claws and exchanged pleasantries with a stream of griffons excited to meet him. The hall was filled with former soldiers who had come to attend an LRN event where volunteers were giving out copies of Fetivola's book, "Revolt Against the Modern World." After talking individually with a good portion of the crowd, Fetivola flew up on a platform to address them.\n\n"My friends, you all know better than anygriff what it means to be proud of your country, what it means to fight for it. If only more griffons today had your spirit!" Fetivola brought a fist to his chest. "Talouse has a truly glorious legacy. It has always been a bastion of civilisation in the face of barbarian aggression. Unfortunately, this legacy has been forgotten and neglected, as modernity has caused severe moral rot in our society. It saddens me to see that so many Talousians have lost their pride in our nation." Fetivola frowned as grumbles of disapproval came from the crowd.\n\n"This is disgraceful! Talouse can never forget the blood you shed nor the sacrifices you made." Fetivola pointed forcefully at his audience. "As we move forward into the new millenium, we must look to our past and at the same time as our future. It is time to restore our legacy, and take up the glorious mantle of Warden of the South once again!" He raised his fist in the air to raucous cheering from the veterans. "Stand up! Vote LRN, and defend our nation's honour!""

talouse.3.d:0 "Amilcare Fetivola called to the devoted crowd that remained after the conclusion of an LRN rally. "Friends, in this most crucial endeavour we rely solely on your generous support to fund our operations," pled Fetivola. "So please, give whatever you can!" He gestured towards a large donation bin beside him where supporters swiftly lined up to make their contributions. Most tossed in coins, but others gave anything from pocket watches to glistening jewelry.\n\n"You!" Fetivola heard a weathered voice call to him. In no time, an old griffon in a fine suit was upon him and excitedly shaking his claw. "That was fantastic! In all my years, I don't think I've ever heard a politician speak with your ferocity and conviction. And it's so rare to see a griffon with such respect for our traditions, too. Boreas bless you!"\n\n"Oh, you are far too kind." Fetivola bowed his head modestly. "I am but a humble messenger."\n\n"Nonsense! You are exactly the leader this country needs, and I want to do whatever I can to help you out," said the old griffon. Fetivola subtly tilted his head towards the donation bin. After a short pause, the old griffon nodded in understanding and winked. He rummaged through his pockets before extending a shaky claw and tossing a single idol into the bin.\n\nFetivola's mouth slowly curved into a smile. "Ah... that will do.""
talouse.3.a:0 "It's for a good cause."

talouse.4.t:0 "Strategy"
talouse.4.d:0 "On a pitch black night, a guard patrolled the entrance to a nondescript warehouse, wiping his brow in the damp and heavy air. No moonlight filtered through the oppressive overcast sky, and so he anxiously swept his lantern in a wide arc ahead of him, on the lookout for intruders. Inside the building, a collection of the highest-ranking LRN party lieutenants sat at a table with their leader, a stone-faced Amilcare Fetivola. Smoke filled the shadowy air as several of the griffons lit cigarettes while others tapped their claws impatiently. After a long and tense silence, Fetivola leaned forward.\n\n"Gentlegriffs, I have called you here for a sensitive discussion," rumbled Fetivola. "As you know, our mission is absolutely vital. The future of Talouse hangs in the balance. In defence of it, all actions are justified." He frowned and narrowed his eyes. "To be honest with you, our party is in a precarious position. As Talnara continues to poach workers away from us, we will need every edge we can get." Fetivola tapped his claw on a pro-FLT poster on the table in front of him.\n\n"We will have to use unsavoury methods, and obtain help from unsavoury characters." As he spoke, Fetivola pulled out a knife and ran his claw along the edge. "Violence, intimidation, vote rigging; everything is permitted. The only concern is victory. Victory at any cost." As punctuation, he plunged the knife into the table, through the FLT poster. "Can I trust you all to do what is necessary?" Fetivola looked around to his lieutenants and saw no doubt in any of them, only steely-eyed determination."
talouse.4.a:0 "No hesitation. No remorse."

talouse.5.t:0 "The Upset of the Century"
talouse.5.d:0 "After much bickering and consternation, the campaign of 1007 has at last come to end. Talousians across the country cast their ballots in a tense election day, one marred by accusations of intimidation and reports of scattered violence at polling places, but after all the votes were counted the results were clear: In a stunning turn of events, the far-right LRN had emerged triumphant.\n\nRegarded as a fringe movement by most serious observers, no griffon could have anticipated such a strong showing for the party. Speaking to a throng of passionate supporters, FRN candidate and founder Amilcare Fetivola claimed the result represented "an end to our nation's decadent status quo" and hailed the beginning of a new age for Talouse. Having achieved victory, Fetivola finally has the power to enact his bold agenda, but what Talouse's future will look like remains to be seen."
talouse.5.a:0 "What were the odds?"

talouse.6.t:0 "The End of the Coal Clause"
talouse.6.d:0 "This morning, Amilcare Fetivola officially announced in a much-anticipated press conference Talouse's unilateral abrogation of the Transnational Mining Clause in Article II of the Karthinian Pact Charter. The nullification of the hated Coal Clause was cause for celebration across the country, and prompted an equal amount of claw-wringing in the boardrooms of Wingbardian mining corporations, whose Talousian operations are now in legal limbo.\n\nThe move has already increased tensions along the border with Wingbardy. In one high profile incident, a convoy of trucks transporting minerals and equipment into Wingbardy was stopped at a border post, leading to an uneasy stand-off. Fetivola's brief time in power has marked a rapid deterioration in Talouse's relations with the Karthinian Pact, and harsh words came in swiftly from other Pact nations after his announcement. Anonymous officials have called the move "unacceptable" and "incompatible with the Pact's mandate of cooperation." In response, Fetivola has stated that this move is only the first step on the path to building a stronger, independent Talouse."
talouse.6.a:0 "Our sovereignty is non-negotiable!"

talouse.7.t:0 "Our Own Path"
talouse.7.d:0 "Ever since the LRN's incredible victory in the recent elections, Fetivola has been hard at work crafting a strong, assertive foreign policy for our nation. Abrogating the Coal Clause was just the beginning; our citizens are sick of the Karthinian Pact and the exploitation that comes with it. No longer will Talouse remain content to wallow in Wingbardy's shadow! All the details have been ironed out, and the time has finally come to leave the evil Pact for good. This bold act marks the beginning of a glorious new era for our nation and the reassertion of our independence. At last, the time has come to seize our own future with our own claws. Gloria alla Talusia!"
talouse.7.a:0 "Free from foreign influence at last!"

talouse.901.t:0 "Talouse Leaves the Karthinian Pact"
talouse.901.d:0 "Following the victory of ultranationalist Amilcare Fetivola and the LRN in the Talousian elections, relations between our two nations have rapidly disintegrated. Infamous for his anti-Wingbardian rhetoric and a griffon obsessed with ancient hatreds, Fetivola has proven himself quite immune to any form of reason. His unilateral nullification of the Coal Clause was just the most egregious in a long series of provocative acts intended to undermine our alliance. And so it was no surprise when we received a letter informing us of Talouse's decision to formally withdraw from the Karthinian Pact. This is a sad day, as a nation which was once a close friend has become an implacable foe."
talouse.901.a:0 "How unfortunate."

talouse.8.t:0 "Revival"
talouse.8.d:0 "Encouraged by new government incentives, the entire nation is seeing a surge of interest in its ancient history and culture. The campaign—a lifelong passion of Fetivola's—has sparked a revival of Talouse's old language, and the tongue is now being taught in school houses and spoken in the halls of power with increasing frequency. Along with this revival comes a rejection of a multitude of modern ideas, particularly Wingbardain ones.\n\nTaking their cues from the LRN, many scholars no longer call the country "Talouse" due to the name's Wingbardian origins, preferring instead to call it "Talonsia." These scholars take it as a given that in order for Talonsia to become strong and prosperous, it must look to its ancient glories for guidance. The rising prominence of such views is yet another indication of Fetivola's growing sway over the country 's intelligentsia."
talouse.8.a:0 "Our old ways are far from forgotten."

talouse.9.t:0 "The Great Awakening"
talouse.9.d:0 "Across Talonsia, more and more griffons from all segments of society are flocking to temples in their search for meaning. These griffons—mostly commoners with little formal education— say that temple attendance has led them to engage in introspection and to commit themselves to a new standard of personal morality. The rising prominence of the temples is partly due to a massive influx of financial resources thanks to the government.\n\nSince their victory in the recent election, the LRN has made it a priority to devote hefty sums of state funds for temples. This spending, accompanied by a campaign of courting and charming religious leaders, is part of the party's effort to bolster the country's cultural and spiritual foundation. These efforts have already caused a sharp increase of interest in religion, along with a profound sense of conviction and redemption on the part of those affected."
talouse.9.a:0 "Temples are the soul of our nation!"

talouse.10.t:0 "The Cult Rises"
talouse.10.d:0 "Outside the mainstream of Griffon religion, there have been griffons who, after the death of Arantigos, believed that the legendary conqueror had merged with Boreas. As their practices became more solidified, this sect became known as the Cult of Arantigos-Boreas. Although denounced as heresy by the Archons in Griffenheim, the Cult has persisted for centuries in pockets all along southern Griffonia.\n\nNow with official support from the government, the Cult is rapidly gaining acceptance among the Talonsian population. In fact, Fetivola himself has revealed that he is a believer in Arantigos-Boreas. As it steps out from the shadows of society, the Cult is gaining large amounts of followers, and believers from other countries as well are flocking to Talonsia, where their practices will enjoy greater tolerance."
talouse.10.a:0 "Arantigos, hear our prayers!"

talouse.11.t:0 "The End of an Era"
talouse.11.d:0 "In his first address to Parliament following its restructuring, Fetivola unleashed a fiery broadside against the Talousian monarchy, denouncing it for leading the country to ruin and asserting that "when a monarchy fails in its duties, it loses every reason for being." He went on to say "the state we want to establish will be national in the highest sense of the word; that is, it will be Talonsian, thus returning to our origins. No longer should arrogant Dukes and Duchesses stand in the way of our glorious destiny!"\n\nFetivola's landmark speech was well received by Parliament, during which he formally put forth a proposal for the abolition of the Talousian monarchy. The proposal was taken up and swiftly passed by the LRN-dominated body, not a surprise given the fact that Duchess Ginevra has clearly lost the confidence of both the government and the general populace."
talouse.11.a:0 "Good riddance."

talouse.12.t:0 "Duchess Ginevra Ousted!"
talouse.12.d:0 "In the wake of Parliament's formal abolition of the monarchy, soldiers were dispatched to occupy the Royal Palace and evict Duchess Ginevra from the residence. With the cooperation of the Royal Guard, their mission proceeded without incident and all of the mansion's wealth and treasures have been confiscated by the state. Supporters of the LRN hailed the operation and celebrated the removal as representing a "new dawn" for the nation.\n\nThe revocation of the Duchess's titles and privileges marks the downfall of a centuries-old dynasty. An ignominious conclusion for such a storied bloodline, but in the end few griffons were willing to rise in her defence. Ginevra's future plans are not known for certain, although she is rumoured to be contemplating fleeing the country."
talouse.12.a:0 "Serves her right!"

talouse.13.t:0 "The Regency"
talouse.13.d:0 "This morning, Fetivola released a bizarre statement in which he proclaimed the beginning of a new regency for the nation. In rather cryptic language, the announcement makes allusions to a divinely ordained "chosen one" who is destined to lead Talonostra's sons to glory. Fetivola has declared himself regent for this mythical figure, who he says will come in the future. When this chosen one will be revealed, along with any details about their identity, he professes not to know."
talouse.13.a:0 "One day, we will seize our destiny."

talouse.14.t:0 "Return to Grandeur"
talouse.14.d:0 "In the streets of Talononte, a massive crowd had gathered in front of a towering temple devoted to Arantigos-Boreas. They were there to witness a speech from Fetivola, and although the sun had already set, the excitement of the crowd had not dissipated in the slightest. When Fetivola finally stepped up to the podium, he called for silence before clearing his throat. "Throughout my life, I have been told many times that Talonsia is dead, that it is a thing which exists only in fairy stories and history books," he began. "It is quite strange that so many still make this assertion. By any measure, it is false. The griffons of Talonsia? Their descendents stand proudly before you. Talonsian culture? It is all around you!" Fetivola stretched his arms out wide to polite applause. "Our nation is alive and well."\n\n"But truthfully, it is more than any one of these aspects alone," he continued. "There is a Talonsian spirit—a vital essence that binds us all together. Over the centuries, that spirit was corrupted by cowardice and decadence, but in a few short years we have repaired it. We have ceased squabbling amongst ourselves over petty matters, and rediscovered our faith." Fetivola looked up to the starry sky in wonder. "We now stand united, stronger than our enemies ever thought possible!" Shouts of agreement rang out from the audience.\n\n"Thanks to our heroic efforts, this great nation has been cleansed of the barbaric influences that made us weak. True, for a shameful period we lost our way, but we are now ready to reclaim our rightful mantle. We have a sacred duty to honour our legacy, and so we shall always stand firm as a bulwark against barbarism and degeneracy!" Fetivola clenched his claw into a fist. "I proudly proclaim that Talonsia is once again the Warden of the South!" He raised his fist high in the air, and in response a deafening wave of cheers erupted from the crowd."
talouse.14.a:0 "We remember our ancient glory!"

talouse.15.t:0 "The Epiphany"
talouse.15.d:0 "Under a brilliant sun, Fetivola sat with his eyes closed and claws clasped together in prayer. "I thank you for lending me strength. It is to your grace that I owe all my accomplishments," he said softly. "I have done much... but what am I to do now? I await your chosen, but I know not who to look for." He squeezed his eyes shut even tighter, trembling slightly. "Who am I waiting for?" For a long moment, the air was still and full of silence.\n\nSuddenly, Fetivola felt a strange sensation as an unnatural warmth washed over him. It was as if he had become untethered from the material world and entered into the spiritual realm. He heard a voice, but not through his ears. It spoke directly to his mind, and said only one word. In an instant, Fetivola was back in his garden.\n\nHis eyes snapped open. He knew the answer. He had always known. "I understand it now... it's me. I am the one who must lead this land to glory!""
talouse.15.a:0 "It is my destiny."

talouse.16.t:0 "The New Parliament"
talouse.16.d:0 "After securing a decisive victory in the recent elections, PC members of parliament have finally taken their seats in time for the upcoming legislative session. Citizens have high expectations for the body, whose new leader promised to bring the prosperity of the glory days back to Talouse. Now that they are finally ready to get down to business, they have an ambitious agenda to implement, but expressed confidence that their policies will be the cure for what ails the nation."
talouse.16.a:0 "They have their work cut out for them."

talouse.17.t:0 "Renegotiation"
talouse.17.d:0 "Wingbardian representatives arrived in Talononte this morning to begin preparations for upcoming talks regarding the Karthinian Pact Charter, with a special focus on the Transnational Mining Clause in Article II. For years Talousians have been fervent in their desire to modify the hated Coal Clause and secure more favourable terms for their country, and after much wrangling the new conservative government eventually secured Wingbardian cooperation. Ahead of the negotiations, Prime Minister di Colliverde stated that he is confident that they will reach a settlement that will address his citizen's grievances and bring prosperity back to Talouse."
talouse.17.a:0 "Surely we can come to an understanding."

talouse.18.t:0 "Settlement"
talouse.18.d:0 "After a whirlwind of negotiations, Wingbardian and Talousian representatives formally unveiled their agreement modifying the infamous Coal Clause. Although Article II remains in place, Talouse will now receive significant monetary compensation for resources extracted by foreign mining interests, due to its unique circumstances. Early polling indicates that a majority of Talousians are satisfied by the arrangement, and di Colliverde's approval rating has soared as a result. The Prime Minister has promised that this new money will go towards boosting the Talousian economy and improving the lives of the citizenry."
talouse.18.a:0 "Wonderful!"

talouse.19.t:0 "Friendship and Alliance"
talouse.19.d:0 "During Parliament's most recent session, Prime Minister di Colliverde gave a passionate speech supporting the Karthinian Pact and extolling the wisdom of Talouse's continued membership. He went on to call the alliance "the Light of the South" and asserted that maintaining it was vital for keeping the region peaceful and stable. His address was much praised both inside and outside Parliament, as most Talousians are in favour of closer cooperation within the Pact. Since the PC's election victory, the government has been on a diplomatic charm offensive, and Talouse's relations with the other Pact nations have been improving steadily. Thanks to efforts such as these, confidence in the alliance is higher than ever."

The Duchess was met by ecstatic crowds from Peckreit to Chiazbeacle, who hung on her every word in praise of the nation and its spirit. Yearning for an end to the violence and chaos of recent years, many Talousians have come to view the royal as above factional politics and petty disagreements, a visible symbol of national unity. Intellectuals from the PC have been the foremost voices promoting this new view of the Monarchy, and it is already catching on among influential segments of the population."
talouse.20.a:0 "Talouse and Ginevra are inextricable!"

talouse.21.t:0 "A Great Society"
talouse.21.d:0 ""Our mission is to provide stability," as he addressed Parliament, Prime Minister di Colliverde's eyes glinted with determination. "But stability is not immobility; some things in Talouse must be changed. We have heard many complaints from workers these past few years. Some have misinterpreted the root cause of this as dissatisfaction with our political system, which is ludicrous." He flicked a dismissive claw.\n\n"The actual complaint of the worker is the insecurity of his existence; he is unsure if he will always have work, he is unsure if he will always be healthy and he can predict that he will reach old age and be unable to work." di Colliverde frowned. "If he falls into poverty, and be that only through prolonged illness, he will find himself totally helpless being on his own, and society currently does not accept enough responsibility towards him beyond the usual provisions for the poor, even if he has been working all the time ever so diligently and faithfully. The fact is, the ordinary provisions for the poor leave much to be desired." He shook his head slowly as murmurs spread through the chambre.\n\n"Today I declare that we must do more to provide for them!" di Colliverde raised an emphatic claw. "We must give our workers the security that they have been unjustly denied, and improve their deplorable conditions. By giving workers a stake in the existing order, Talouse will continue to stand strong, and her griffons will stand more loyal than ever!" In response, all of Parliament erupted with shouts of agreement."

В течении долгих лет талузианцы желали уничтожить ненавистную угольную статью и восстановить контроль над природными ресурсами своей страны, и после долгих споров премьер-министр Палтори в конечном итоге добился переговоров о пересмотре условий.

Мир становится все более и более связанным между собой, и мы должны выйти за рамки этих отношений и расширить наши горизонты.

talouse.41.t:0 "A Smaller Government"
talouse.41.d:0 ""There is a great beast which threatens Talouse," Prime Minister Paltori voice was stern as he addressed Parliament. "It has long hindered our economic growth, stifling innovation and preventing our technological advancement. This beast is no outside imposition, it is our own creation. I speak, of course, of the Talousian state, which imposes burdensome regulations with its intrusive claw." Paltori frowned, furrowing his brow.\n\n"I say that the government should not be in the business of picking winners and losers. We must not forget the Iron Law of Regulation: that all regulation eventually leads to a net loss in social welfare," he continued, raising a lecturing talon. "So let the markets decide! Entrepreneurs should be unfettered and allowed to fly free. It is a simple truth that fewer and simpler regulations will increase competitiveness, leading to higher productivity, more efficiency, and lower prices overall. What's good for the consumer is for Talouse!" he thundered, raising his talon high in the air. "This is the step we must take in order to enter into a new age of prosperity." In response, all of Parliament erupted with shouts of agreement."
talouse.41.a:0 "This will ensure our freedom!"

talouse.42.t:0 "Peace, Progress, Prosperity"
talouse.42.d:0 "At this point in his tenure, there is no doubt that Prime Minister Paltori has ushered in a new era for Talouse. Under his firm stewardship the economy has rebounded and citizens of all stripes have seen their standard of living greatly increase; the rising tide has lifted all boats. This material prosperity has brought with it stabilisation of the political sphere, and the domestic unrest and violence that once plagued the nation has been completely eradicated.\n\nMore and more, Talousians are looking outwards towards their neighbours. Much has changed since the long ago campaign of 1007, during which Paltori advocated close cooperation with Wingbardy and the Karthinian Pact. Developments in the world situation now call for a reevaluation of Talouse's geopolitical situation and foreign policy. This is a pivotal moment, with the country's future hanging in the balance, but a choice must be made."
talouse.42.a:0 "We must defend what we have built."

talouse.43.t:0 "Breaking the Front"
talouse.43.d:0 "The Prime Minister has requested a plan of attack for neutralising the danger posed by groups plotting the overthrow of their legitimately elected government. The fact is, in spite of all our efforts to date, the Talousian state remains threatened by the violent revolutionaries of the FLT. Operations shall be undertaken without delay to purge Talousian society of communist influence and stamp out all remaining resistance. Suggested actions are as follows:\n\n(1) Implementing reforms to erode public support for radicalism\n(2) Arresting prominent agitators\n(3) Educating citizens about the dangers of communism\n(4) Infiltrating labour organisations to undermine FLT unity from within\n\nIf properly confronted, this internally-conflicted alliance of malcontents poses no threat to our nation's stability. Dutiful vigilance is all that is needed to send it tumbling into the dustbin of history."
talouse.43.a:0 "We shall not fail."

talouse.44.t:0 "On Every Street..."
talouse.44.d:0 "Under a sunny sky in Talononte, the streets were filled with disgruntled griffons waving signs and chanting FLT slogans. What began as a small strike of factory workers in the capital to show solidarity with the conditions of Talouse's miners quickly picked up steam as workers in other cities across the country also went on strike. Emmanuel Talnara himself was present in Talononte to deliver a speech to fortify the strikers' resolve.\n\n"Workers of Talouse, today we stand together with our comrades in the mountains," began Talnara. "The miners who toil in atrocious conditions, whose bodies are broken in the name of the Coal Clause." He frowned and shook his head. "Yes, that clause which empowers corporations to behave unethically in the pursuit of profit, exploiting Talouse and its citizens. We speak with one voice when we say: no more!" he thundered. "No longer should the resources of this land be syphoned away for the benefit of bourgeois Wingbardian interests. Those resources belong to the workers of Talouse!" Shouts of agreement exploded forth from the strikers.\n\n"Today we have spoken loudly with our actions." Talnara gave a determined smile. "Together we have demonstrated that the oppression and exploitation of the workers will not be ignored any longer! We have the power to make a change, and our time is now. Yes, the time has come for a worker's Talouse!" Talnara raised a fist to deafening cheers from the crowd."
talouse.44.a:0 "Brothers, let us free ourselves!"

talouse.45.t:0 "The Hammer and the Pickaxe"
talouse.45.d:0 ""And so, in spite of whatever disagreements we may have had in the past, I urge you to put aside your misgivings." Inside a cramped meeting hall high in the mountains, Emmanuel Talnara made his case to a group of miners. He knew all too well the miners had little central organisation, being based on largely autonomous local clubs. Convincing a majority of the clubs would be a difficult process, but he had to do it one speech at a time. "The task before us now is simply too important," he concluded, looking out at a sea of sceptical faces.\n\nWithin seconds, a burly griffon arose from the front row, clearly agitated. "Spare us the lectures!" he spat. "You syndicalists are very eloquent, but we've heard it all before. For years we've gone along with all your strikes and it hasn't gotten us anywhere!" He glanced around to rouse his fellow miners, prompting them to give shouts of sympathy. "Why should we keep following along when it's obvious you don't really care about us?"\n\nA wave of unrest rippled through the crowd, and Talara waited for it to die down before responding. "We do not share the same aims," he said, stepping down from his podium. "But you know we share the same enemies." He approached the audience, eventually coming face to face with the brawny heckler. "They are wealthy, they are powerful, and they have been oppressing griffons like us for countless generations. Do you really believe you can topple them on your own?" Talnara raised his claws to punctuate the question.\n\n"Talouse is at a crossroads. If we expend our energy fighting each other at this moment, then all hope is already lost. The simple truth is we can only win by working together and combining the potency of our organisations." Talnara extended a claw towards his irritated opponent. A long pause followed, with the griffon's face twisting into a scowl.\n\nFinally, he opened his beak. "You're right." He took Talnara's claw and shook it begrudgingly. "We do need you.""

talouse.46.t:0 "The Crimson Tide"
talouse.46.d:0 "After much bickering and consternation, the campaign of 1007 has at last come to end. Talousians across the country cast their ballots in a tense election day, one marred by accusations of intimidation and reports of scattered violence at polling places, but after all the votes were counted the results were clear: In a surprising turn of events, the FLT had emerged triumphant.\n\nAs a coalition of disparate labour factions with a history of internal bickering, few observers thought the party capable of putting together such a strong performance. After hearing the results, working-class griffons across the country partied and rejoiced, celebrating the beginning of a new age for Talouse. Having achieved victory at last, unity within the FLT is sure to be strained even further, as disagreements within the party will only increase in salience once they are in control of national policy."

talouse.47.t:0 "The Talousian Way"
talouse.47.d:0 ""Today, we stand at a precipice of great uncertainty—these are difficult times. For although we have made tremendous strides, our beloved homeland is threatened by external aggression." Paltori's face was serious as he delivered his speech to the crowd that had assembled outside Parliament. "But let us not forget: guided by the twin lights of liberty and democracy, Talouse has entered into the modern age. Our nation has marched forward into a bright and prosperous future; we have improved our infrastructure and made unparalleled material progress." As he continued to speak, pride swelled in his voice. "We have reaped the fruits of capitalism and consumerism, and now our citizens stand more united than ever." Paltori raised a triumphant fist.\n\n"And united we must stand if we are to confront the Wingbardian menace." Paltori couldn't help but scowl. "It was with much dismay that we witnessed the fall of their once great Kingdom. A nation which was once our closest ally has succumbed to their darkest instincts, and become an implacable foe. They seek to spread terror throughout the entire South, extinguishing the light of liberty wherever it exists." Jeers swept through the audience, and a few voices began shouting patriotic slogans. "But Talouse will never abide by such tyranny! With our indomitable spirit, we are prepared to face any challenge." Paltori's voice was loud and defiant, prompting a second wave of cheering, far louder than the first. "This is my solemn promise: Toulouse will never surrender. We will persevere, and we will always defend our way of life!""
talouse.47.a:0 "Long live liberty!"

talouse.48.t:0 "The End of the Coal Clause"
talouse.48.d:0 "This morning, Emmanuel Talnara officially announced in a much-anticipated press conference Talouse's unilateral abrogation of the Transnational Mining Clause in Article II of the Karthinian Pact Charter. The nullification of the hated Coal Clause was cause for celebration across the country, and prompted an equal amount of claw-wringing in the boardrooms of Wingbardian mining corporations, whose Talousian operations are now in legal limbo.\n\nThe move has already increased tensions along the border with Wingbardy. In one high profile incident, a convoy of trucks transporting minerals and equipment into Wingbardy was stopped at a border post, leading to an uneasy stand-off. Talnara's brief time in power has marked a rapid deterioration in Talouse's relations with the Karthinian Pact, and harsh words came in swiftly from other Pact nations after his announcement. Anonymous officials have called the move "unacceptable" and "a stick to the eye of Talouse's allies." In response, Talnara has stated that this move is only the first step on the path to creating a new, working-class led nation."
talouse.48.a:0 "No more capitalist exploitation!"

talouse.49.t:0 "Operation Lupara Bianca"
talouse.49.d:0 "Under Talnara's direction, police forces initiated an unprecedented crackdown on the Talousian Mafia with the intent of eradicating it from the country. The notorious crime syndicate had a rapid rise to prominence in recent decades, becoming heavily involved in numerous illegal activities including protection racketeering, smuggling, and loan sharking, but now it all is coming to an end. The government's campaign has already produced impressive results as leading figures from all of the Talousian Families have been taken in custody, leaving the organisation scattered and disorganised.\n\nRevelations related to the operation sparked a minor scandal when it was discovered that many Talousian politicians ousted in the recent election had Mafia links, including some of the FLT's most vocal opponents. Crushing the notorious criminal enterprise has earned the FLT much praise, and so easily accomplishing what previous administrations struggled to accomplish has greatly legitimised their rule, along with strengthening Talnara's leadership."
talouse.49.a:0 "We will put an end to corruption wherever it tries to hide."

talouse.50.t:0 "Confiscate the Crown!"
talouse.50.d:0 "During the campaign of 1007, Talnara criticised the Talousian monarchy as anachronistic and outdated; something Talouse had long since outgrown but that was still holding society back. Most provocatively, he called for its complete abolition, saying that an undemocratic, hereditary monarchy was incompatible with a classless society. Now the FLT has emerged triumphant, it finally has the power to deal with the issue definitively.\n\nThe formal abolition of the monarchy took place this morning without much fanfare, carried out by FLT officials in a closed-door session. Afterwards, soldiers were dispatched to occupy the Royal Palace and evict Duchess Ginevra from the residence. Facing no resistance from the Royal Guard, their mission proceeded without incident and all of the mansion's wealth and treasures were confiscated. Supporters of the FLT hailed the operation and celebrated her removal as ushering in an "age of equality" for the nation.\n\nThe revocation of the Duchess's titles and privileges marks the downfall of a centuries-old dynasty. An ignominious conclusion for such a storied bloodline, but in the end few griffons were willing to rise in her defence. Ginevra's future plans are not known for certain, although she is rumoured to be contemplating fleeing the country."
talouse.50.a:0 "Good riddance."

talouse.51.t:0 "Overthrow"
talouse.51.d:0 "In their most aggressive move yet since seizing power, the FLT has taken the extraordinary step of completely abolishing the Talousian parliament. The building itself was closed down, with soldiers preventing any MPs who wished to enter from doing so. Speaking in support of the action, Emmanuel Talnara claimed in a speech that Talouse had "outgrown the bourgeois institution of parliament" and that the country's administrative structure would be overhauled to "facilitate the transition to a lasting communist society." However, what that new administrative structure will look like has yet to be firmly defined, and reports indicate that there is a passionate debate within the FLT itself over what it should look like."
talouse.51.a:0 "We'll figure it out eventually."

talouse.52.t:0 "The Schism"
talouse.52.d:0 "After emerging victorious from the recent elections, the FLT has been extremely active, taking aggressive actions to free Talouse from the chains of its history. The accomplishments are piling up, but even in this moment of triumph, disagreements within the party have grown more heated than ever.\n\nThe removal of parliament and the monarchy, along with the diminished influence of the other parties, have set up a vicious struggle between factions within the FLT, with a great deal of contention over how to fill the power vacuum. The orthodox syndicalist faction, led by Talnara himself, view trade unions as the natural building blocks of a post-capitalist society. The syndicalists stress the importance of being prepared for war, and hold dreams of spreading the Revolution to Talouse's neighbours.\n\nOpposed to them are Talouse's various independent mountain communities, composed of pious miners and other eclectics. The miners have unconventional views, including a far more isolationist foreign policy stance, and are fearful of political domination by urban industrial workers. The priests of these communities have long preached a doctrine of radical equality, and the miners have taken it to heart in their vision for a peaceful, utopian society.\n\nAt this point, things have finally come to a head. The positions of the two factions are irreconcilable, and only one can seize Talouse's future."

On top of that, their reckless warmongering would surely lead Talouse to ruin. And so, the pious griffons of this land are compelled to take the reins of power and not let go.

The value of propaganda can not be overstated; in this situation the pen truly is mightier than the sword. Fortunately, none of our brave followers have forgotten this truth, and they have already begun a coordinated effort to tar the reputation of syndicalism with a myriad of underground operations. These operations seek to target and subvert symbols of syndicalist power, demonstrating their helplessness to the Talousian people. This far-reaching campaign will help us greatly in our struggle against the incompetent extremeists who oppose us, and will serve to bolster our popularity even further."

talouse.57.d:0 "A pamphlet titled "Against Superstition," recently published by an anonymous Talousian, has become an immediate sensation across the country. Within it the author uses clear and persuasive prose to marshal moral and political arguments encouraging common griffons to oppose the greed and corruption of the temples. A general scepticism towards religion is accompanied by particularly harsh vitriol directed towards the Archons, and it not so subtly implies that a victory for the miners would result in an Archonate-dominated Talouse. The pamphlet has proven to be a smash hit, and is being sold and distributed widely and read aloud at taverns and meeting places in every city. This fortuitous development will help us greatly in our struggle against the ignorant miners who oppose us, and will serve to bolster our popularity even further."

From a storm of chaos and uncertainty its populace emerged transformed, more determined and conscious than ever before. The city was the cradle of Revolution, and its citizens had defended it every step of the way. It was a renewed city, an ideal capital for a renewed nation.\n\n"My fellow citizens," began Talnara.

Not so long ago, it was the brave griffons of this city who were instrumental in demolishing the oppressive institutions of Talouse, and paving the way for the ultimate triumph of labour!" he thundered, causing the crowd to unleash a forceful round of applause. "But you were not alone. Unions across the country stood together in solidarity, and they all played a part in securing our glorious Revolution."\n\n"But we did not stop at mere political reform," Talnara boasted, raising a talon. "We also took steps to bring about economic prosperity. Thanks to a campaign of aggressive industrialisation, we launched Talouse into the modern age. We put an end to capitalist exploitation, all the while making every effort to uplift formerly oppressed griffons." He smiled proudly.

All we must do is stand united in the face of adversity, always staying vigilant for signs of treachery and defeatism." Fetivola raised a talon for emphasis as Parliament erupted with applause and shouts of agreement. "Yes, we must never underestimate the importance of spirit! A strong will can overcome any material obstacle, no matter how daunting," He explained, radiating a calming certainty. "I promise you that with our unshakable spirit, we will seize our future.""
talouse.63.a:0 "Together, we are unstoppable!"

talouse.64.t:0 "Ancient Enemies"
talouse.64.d:0 "At an army base near the eastern border, the unsuspecting garrison was surprised to find their morning routine interrupted by a visit from their supreme commander himself. The troops marched out from their barracks, forming rows in front of the platform where Fetivola stood. Once they were all in proper position, Fetivola cleared his throat. "Greetings!" His voice boomed as he smiled widely. "It warms my heart to see such dutiful servants of Talonsia. Truly, your skills are indispensable, and all your dedication will be needed for the fight which lies ahead of us." His expression abruptly lost its joviality, turning deadly serious. "The hour is nearing for our final confrontation with the Wingbardian menace. They, along with their enslaved minions, seek nothing less than the destruction of our entire nation." A blanket of tense unease fell over the base.\n\n"This struggle will demand every citizen and soldier's total commitment. Trepidation, hesitation, and the like are signs of weak spirit and cowardice, which have no place in the heart of a Talonsian," Fetivola continued, casting a determined gaze over the troops. "Each of us must remember our old superiority as mountain fighters. In ancient times we brave warriors beat back the Wingbardians and stood up to them unshakably, in order to keep Talonsia safe from barbarism." He brought a clenched fist against his chest. "There must be no doubt: he who wavers has forfeited his life. Cowardice has no place in our ranks!" Fetivola's words thundered across the base, inspiring spontaneous cheers from his audience. "Never forget: we are fighting for our homeland! No soldier in the world may be better than we, the sons of Arantigos!""
talouse.64.a:0 "The barbarians are at the gates!"

talouse.65.t:0 "In the Shadow of the Conqueror"
talouse.65.d:0 "The sun burned hot over the streets of Sparleto, sending ripples through the air as Fetivola toured his recent acquisition. He felt no discomfort, though, as the place had captured him utterly. Everywhere he looked, he could not help but marvel at the wonders of the storied and ancient city: grand buildings built millenia ago, exquisite tapestries, artifacts of the Arantigan Empire. Such culture! Fortunately, Sparleto was now in Talonsian claws, and Talonsians would be far better caretakers of this culture than Arantigans.\n\nHe walked through the city at a steady pace until he saw something that stopped him in his tracks. In a plaza near the city centre, a large statue of immaculate marble towered over him. The figure was unmistakable, it was the legend himself: Arantigos. Sword in claw, from the era of his most glorious conquests. Fetivola was awed at the majesty, and could do little except lower himself out of reverence. It was a humbling moment; realising that despite all his achievements up to now, he was nowhere close to the legend that loomed before him.\n\nHumbling, but far from disheartening. Fetivola clenched his claws in determination. He wasn't finished yet. His empire has only just been revived, and he promised himself that he would not rest until it entered into a new age of glory to match the old. He would see it done.\n\nNo matter what."
talouse.65.a:0 "This legacy is an honour, and a burden."

talouse.66.t:0 "Destiny"
talouse.66.d:0 "Fetivola tapped a claw idly as he looked over the map of Griffonia that lay before him. The map was sprawling, so big that it barely fit on the grand table he and his high-ranking military staff had gathered around. He appreciated his generals, although they too often neglected the strategic aspects of warfare, becoming bogged down in operational tactics and minutiae.\n\n"You all have done well so far," Fetivola said, looking at each of the military griffons around him. "The boundaries of our empire have become quite formidable, but there are still opportunities near us waiting to be seized." His claw swept across the map from New Mareland, east to Falcor and Sicameon, and finally north to the ancestral home of griffonkind, Griffonstone. "Our armies will march to reclaim all these territories, and the Talonsian Empire's majesty will be known throughout the world!" The generals around him all nodded without a trace of hesitation. It went without saying that they would carry out Fetivola's will, or die trying."
talouse.66.a:0 "We will take our rightful place in the world!"

talouse.67.t:0 "Talonsia Reborn"
talouse.67.d:0 "As he felt a cool breeze from the ocean sweep over him, Fetivola gave a contented sigh. It had been far too long since he stopped to truly appreciate Talononte. Thanks to his efforts, the city had been transformed from the one he knew as a child. Looking out over it from his mansion, it was hardly recognisable. From an unremarkable trading port to the centre of a glorious empire!\n\nIts citizens reaped the fruits of their empire, as wealth and treasures once unfathomable now flowed daily through Talononte. Artisans and scholars from across Griffonia flocked to the city to share in the riches of Talonsia. Fetivola smiled. It was the return of prosperity, the revival of an ancient culture. The return of pride.\n\nIt was the vindicated of all he fought for: a new empire to match the highest heights of the old! His life's work had been achieved. Fetivola removed his glasses as tears began to well in his eyes.\n\nFor the first time in life, he was filled with joy."
talouse.67.a:0 "Arantigos smiles upon us."

talouse.68.t:0 "Liberation"
talouse.68.d:0 "This morning, representatives from the most prominent Talousian, Francistrian, Arantigan, and Wingbardian unions all gathered in Talononte to take part in the establishment of the Socialist Republic of Southern Griffonia. This new federal state represents the realisation of Talnara and other syndicalists' ultimate dream: the triumph of labour and the creation of a new worker-based economic organization of society across the entire South. It was not an easy road to get there, requiring the defeat of once-mighty empires, but in the end all the oppressive regimes fell, leaving the region united under Talouse's righteous standard. No doubt this momentous event marks the beginning of a new era of peace, prosperity, and equality for our citizens."
talouse.68.a:0 "The South's chains are broken!"

talouse.69.t:0 "Guardians of the Downtrodden"
talouse.69.d:0 ""I will be plain with you all: difficult times lie ahead of us." Talnara's tone was sombre as he made his address to an enraptured National Assembly. "Yes, we have accomplished much, but soon we will be called upon to defend it. As I speak, our enemies are gathering strength, intent on crushing the Revolution and undoing all the progress we have made." Looking out over his audience, Talnara could see that the delegates all recognised the gravity of the situation. "Powerful forces of reaction have arrayed themselves against us, but we will not shrink from the challenge."\n\n"We must ready our arms and fortify our spirits for the task ahead. And we must not sit passively, but be aggressive in confronting those who seek to destroy us." Talnara continued, prompting a number of delegates to let loose shouts of agreement. "We will never abandon our righteous mission to liberate all workers from oppression and exploitation!" He raised a fist for emphasis, his booming voice filling the assembly chambre. "I promise you that we will face our enemies, and we will win. Because we fight not just for our own nation, but for workers everywhere!" As Talnara's speech reached its climax, a volley of deafening cheers engulfed the Assembly."
talouse.69.a:0 "Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."

talouse.70.t:0 "Historia Talonsia"
talouse.70.d:0 ""Dear friends, today I am going to do something a little different. I am going to tell you a story." Under a sunny sky in Talononte, Amilcare Fetivola spoke in the shadow of an ancient column. "It is a story of bravery and complacency, of triumph and decline. Most importantly, this story is a true one, for it is your story." Fetivola pointed to the crowd gathered around him as his words took on a wistful air. "This is the story of the sons of Arantigos."\n\n"Long ago, the great conqueror Arantigos swept through this land, defeating the scattered tribes and uniting them under his nephew, Marco Talonostra. Talonostra brought order and initiated many great building projects, including the construction of this very city!" Fetivola raised his claws in wonder. "It was he who gave this land its name: Talonsia. Arantigos bestowed upon it the glorious title of Warden of the South. And so it was the duty and honour of Talonsia to be the stalwart defenders of civilisation."\n\n"The Talonsians there were the happiest and most prosperous griffons on the entire continent! But their ascendency was not to last. Instead of staying true to their traditions, over time they intermingled with barbarians and became corrupted by savagery." Fetivola frowned and shook his head. "They lost their way, and now their glorious empire is nothing but a distant memory. Yes, it is a sad ending." He looked into his audience and saw a sea of gloomy and dejected faces.\n\n"But is it truly an ending?" Fetivola raised an eyebrow. "Because I believe that one day those griffons will become strong again; that they will remember the wisdom of their old ways, and use it to regain their rightful position!" The crowd began to murmur in agreement. "But that is just my belief. In the end, it will be up to you all to make it a reality.""

HLQ_paramilitaries_in_the_streets_desc:0 "Our Police force is not strong enough to keep the ponies and dissidents in line. Wingfried has proposed to militarise them by turning them into paramilitary groups which any fanatic teen can apply for. This will not only show young Griffons the strength of the new Hellquill, but it will also keep the pressure on our domestic enemies."

HLQ_the_new_frontier:0 "The Brave New Frontier"
HLQ_the_new_frontier_desc:0 "New industrial Frontiers must be set up in the more undeveloped provinces of our Country. That way, we can assure industrial production is spread all throughout the country."
HLQ_the_industrial_revolution:0 "The Industrial Revolution"

HLQ_the_kingdom_of_hellquill:0 "Proclaim the Kingdom"
HLQ_the_kingdom_of_hellquill_desc:0 "The time has come to proclaim ourselves something greater! As a relative of the Princess of Katerin, Wingfried has royal blood and the divine right to kingship. The newly crowned King Wingfried will lead us towards a bright future! He will rid us of ponykind, and grant us a thousand years of prosperity!"
HLQ_the_war_economy:0 "Calibrate the Economy"
HLQ_the_war_economy_desc:0 "It is time to adjust our economy and prepare for war. Military production henceforth has a much greater importance than the individual's needs. To win our struggle, every Griffon must make sacrifices, after all."
HLQ_the_ostwall_building:0 "Construct the Ostwall"
HLQ_the_ostwall_building_desc:0 "It is time to improve existing fortifications and expand them for the defence against our foe to the east. Should the ponies wish to come, they'll bleed on our walls."
HLQ_prepare_longsword:0 "The Longsword Border Wall"
HLQ_prepare_longsword_desc:0 "The conquered territories of Longsword must be prepared for what is to come. They, too, will remain valiant in the face of danger! A vast, unbroken border wall shall deter the ponies."
HLQ_prepare_the_crusade:0 "The Grand Crusade"
HLQ_prepare_the_crusade_desc:0 "It's time. Wingfried has announced to his people and the world that there is only one option for peace in Griffonia. We must rid ourselves of the ponies on our beloved continent, or we must vanquish in our attempt. We must show no mercy! This is our time!"
HLQ_test_subjects:0 "Group 935"
HLQ_test_subjects_desc:0 "Seeing as how ponies are nothing but rats either way, our scientists have requested to use them as test subjects for dangerous experiments. It helps our research effort and saves us a few bullets, so there is nothing speaking against it."
HLQ_beasts_of_labour:0 "Beasts of Burden"
HLQ_beasts_of_labour_desc:0 "The conquest of eastern lands means that we will occupy the lands of ponies. Obviously, it shall not remain pony land, and the ponies themselves, as the vermin that they truly are, will be turned into expendable resources of the industry. Simple workhorses for our nation. Those who cannot work will be sorted out swiftly."
HLQ_role_of_stormgriffons:0 "The Role of the Sturmgreifen"
HLQ_role_of_stormgriffons_desc:0 "There have been discussions surrounding the combat role of our Sturmgreifen brigades. We should decide on what role they play in the armed forces, an active or supportive one."
HLQ_prepare_the_people:0 "Prepare the People"
HLQ_prepare_the_people_desc:0 "The people of Hellquill must be called to arms. No able-bodied griffon should shy away from the glorious battle that is to come! Every griffon who takes arms will be invaluable in the fight against the ponies."
HLQ_proper_cadets:0 "Junkerschulen"
HLQ_proper_cadets_desc:0 "The Sturmgreifen are the most elite part of our troops, and yet they lack specialised training. The newly established "Junkerschulen" will provide them with the perfect places to conduct military training and ideological exercise. With these real centers of military education and training in place, our elite troops will become even more elite!"
HLQ_finish_industry:0 "Finish the Revolution"
HLQ_finish_industry_desc:0 "Our industrial revolution comes to an end, and our industry has never looked better! There is still room for improvement, but at least we are now able to put up a fight."
HLQ_bring_settlers:0 "Expand Neuland Settlements"
HLQ_bring_settlers_desc:0 "The Neuland Campaign has been a resounding success. As such, we should expand these new settlements and bring in even more Griffon settlers. There is a home for every Griffon in Hellquill!"
HLQ_war_industry:0 "The War Industry"
HLQ_war_industry_desc:0 "Our industry, now relatively well-developed, must be further expanded to suit our growing needs. Every aspect of our production must go towards fighting the ponies."

HLQ_regular_economics:0 "Neues Geschäft"
HLQ_regular_economics_desc:0 "Although the economy has been propped up by the treasure taken from Diamond Mountain, it has not properly encapsuled every aspect of our nation and society, and many griffons continue to plow fields and toil in mines. We must use our available resources wisely to bring a full fledged industrial revolution to Hellquill."
HLQ_support_middle_class:0 "Support The Middle Class"
HLQ_support_middle_class_desc:0 "A strong middle class of citizens is required for a nation to prosper. They're the ones who can afford to invest into businesses, and spend their money on various amenities. Thus, it is imperative that we should expand our industrial centres to accomodate more workers, who'll earn their fair wage."
HLQ_work_smart:0 "Arbeite Schlau!"
HLQ_work_smart_desc:0 "Work smarter, not harder - while anygriff can be taught how to work on the assembly line, it takes more to educate them to understand their role in the production process. This crucial knowledge will allow our workers to notice defects and correct them, as well as suggesting their own improvements for the manufacturing process."
HLQ_foreign_industrial_deals:0 "Shake Claws With Blautronik"
HLQ_foreign_industrial_deals_desc:0 "Developing a modern arms industry from scratch is a difficult endeavour, thus we must look outside for assistance. Fortunately, friendly companies in the Imperial Heartlands would be more than happy to help us modernise, in exchange for a few grants and subsidies. A mutually beneficial exchange for all."
HLQ_fiscal_reforms:0 "Fiscal Reforms"
HLQ_fiscal_reforms_desc:0 "Our tax code is an archaic legislation mired in outdated protocols and vestiges of feudalism. It needs to be reformed to lessen the burden on the less fortunate citizens, while removing some unjust privileges the wealthy have enjoyed. A more proportional method of taxation shall be implemented, instead."
HLQ_steel_industry:0 "Expand The Wingenberg Coal Mines"
HLQ_steel_industry_desc:0 "Coal is the primary resource required for the production of steel, as well as powering up various machines. Existing mines must be expanded, as we are close to exceeding the current supply and production. It will ensure prosperity for our future, even for all the smog in the air."
HLQ_tungsten_industry:0 "The Soldau Tungsten Mines"
HLQ_tungsten_industry_desc:0 "An incredibly dense and robust metal, tungsten is crucial for the production of machine tools, armoured vehicles and artillery shells. However, it is quite rare and almost always found combined with other metals, which requires more modern processing facilities to extract this precious resource."
HLQ_oil_autarky:0 "Solving The Oil Issue"
HLQ_oil_autarky_desc:0 "As modernisation occurs at a rapid pace, we find ourselves lacking crucial resources that simply aren't present in the territory we control. While it is possible to import them, the costs are high and damaging for our industrial development. We'll assign our scientists to figure out a way to create synthetic oil and rubber."
HLQ_full_spead_ahead:0 "Full Speed Ahead!"
HLQ_full_spead_ahead_desc:0 "Already, our economical reform is showing tangible progress. Griffons flock to the cities in search of better employment, the use of machinery and electronics is becoming widespread, the nation as a whole is more prosperous and industrialised compared to a decade ago. We must continue striving to improve our Hellquill!"
HLQ_fascist_economics:0 "Nationale Wirtschaftsabteilung"
HLQ_fascist_economics_desc:0 "The first rule of any economy is that we do not have all that we require. And why is that? Hellquill's enemies are hoarding and stockpiling their resources, intending to halt our industrial progress. The state will have to intervene and control the industry, production of resources and flow of goods. It is the only way to survive."
HLQ_build_up_industrial_base:0 "Rapid Industrial Buildup"
HLQ_build_up_industrial_base_desc:0 "Our industrial capacity is insufficient for our needs, and what already exists is woefully outdated and sluggish. Bureaucracy and labour rights will have to be bypassed to drag Hellquill to the modern age, one machine at a time."
HLQ_appropriate_pony_farms:0 "Appropriate Dissident Farms"
HLQ_appropriate_pony_farms_desc:0 "The filthy ponies continue to squat at our land, hoarding and stealing food for themselves. Many continue to resist our transparent effort to cleanse Hellquill of their kind, leaving us with no other choice but to forcefully seize their farmholdings. What happens afterward to the destitutes is not our concern."
HLQ_collectivization_effort:0 "Kollektivierung"
HLQ_collectivization_effort_desc:0 "With most of the farmland now owned by the state, it is time to finish the process and eliminate any private ownership of the food production. Once this is completed, peasants will be assigned strict quotas in terms of grain and metals produced, ensuring our self-sufficient methods will continue to prosper."
HLQ_builder_squads:0 "Baubrigaden"
HLQ_builder_squads_desc:0 "Hellquill's infrastructure is insufficient for mass movement of our armies. Furthermore, construction tends to be delayed by lack of resources and workers. The state will once more have to intervene and form a dedicated group of builders, who will ensure everything is done on time, and any damage is repaired quickly."
HLQ_industrial_expansion:0 "The Beakstadt Industrial Park"
HLQ_industrial_expansion_desc:0 "Beakstadt is one of the few cities in Hellquill that have been industrialised before our reforms, and we consider it fitting that the government will invest in the expansion and modernisation of its industrial sector. It shall also create new jobs for the citizens, ensuring further natural growth."
HLQ_connecting_the_nation:0 "Nationaler Eisenbahndienst"
HLQ_connecting_the_nation_desc:0 "With previously underdeveloped areas of Hellquill becoming proper cities in their own right, we find ourselves with the lack of proper infrastructure to connect them. Existing roads are not optimal enough for the mass transportation of resources or units, thus we consider it mandatory to build railways to correct this issue."
HLQ_thriving_arms_industry:0 "Militärisch-Industrielle Zusammenarbeit"
HLQ_thriving_arms_industry_desc:0 "The union of industry and military is a natural one, based on the pressing need to supply our armed forces with sufficient material for their needs. This relationship will be bolstered by continued investments from the government in the firearm production sector."
HLQ_zinten_uni:0 "Fund The University Of Hellquill"
HLQ_zinten_uni_desc:0 "With Hellquill close to becoming fully modernised like the wealthy nations of the west, there is one crucial remaining task to fulfill. To achieve higher education, many citizens migrate westward, and some do not return. This damages the nation, as it needs every bright griffon, and thus the first institute of higher learning shall be opened in Hellquill."

HLQ_wehrmacht:0 "The Wehrmacht"
HLQ_wehrmacht_desc:0 "Now that we have stabilised our rule in Hellquill, we must think of defending ourselves from outside intruders. To accomplish this, the Wehrmacht must be established to create a modern armed force, which shall continue our proud knightly traditions."
HLQ_heer:0 "The Heer"
HLQ_heer_desc:0 "One of the branches, and perhaps the most important, owing to our location in Griffonia is the Hellquillische Heer. As of now, it is mostly leftovers from the Knightly Order. We shall reform it and retool it to become a proper army, one that stands tall and proud."
HLQ_mass_assault_f:0 "As Many As Possible"
HLQ_mass_assault_f_desc:0 "The most important part of any war is to have as many guns on the field as possible. 1,000 griffons with guns will almost always beat 500 griffons with guns. We should aim to expand our army to be as large as possible. Quantity, after all, has a quality all its own."
HLQ_grand_assault_f:0 "Establish the OKH"
HLQ_grand_assault_f_desc:0 "The novel idea of a general staff has reached the desk of [Root.GetLeader]. With regards to this, they have floated a proposal to establish a high command with the purpose of better drawing up plans and contingencies for any sort of situation that might arise. We shall approve this proposal."
HLQ_superior_firepower_f:0 "Festung Artillery Doctrine"
HLQ_superior_firepower_f_desc:0 "Ultimately, shells are cheap, griffons are expensive. We should focus on drowning our enemies in shells and explosions, not the corpses of our citizens. Ultimately, a live griffon is better."
HLQ_mobile_warfare_f:0 "Blitzkrieg!"
HLQ_mobile_warfare_f_desc:0 "There is also a new invention that has been making the rounds in the world lately. The armored divisions have seen great success elsewhere in the world, with new models and stories about both an armoured spearhead and 'lightning warfare' come in from all directions. We should adopt this."
HLQ_artillery_f:0 "Introduce the Leichte Feldhaubitze"
HLQ_artillery_f_desc:0 "A number of enterprising engineers have come up with an invention. Calling it the "light field cannon" they are hopeful that it will be put into mass production. Certainly now it will."
HLQ_anti_air_f:0 "The Flak Cannon"
HLQ_anti_air_f_desc:0 "Dangers can lurk both above and below. While the potential for a tunneling machine is still far, far out in the future, we should be wary of any bombing attacks from potential enemies. As such, we should invest into new anti-aircraft weaponry so that the skies may be forever clear."
HLQ_anti_tank_f:0 "The Panzerabwehrkanone"
HLQ_anti_tank_f_desc:0 "Trying to attack tanks and panzers with nothing but a rifle is a fool’s errand. While individual infantry squads have seen success with throwing a hand grenade down the windpipe of a tank, this will not do on a wider scale. We need to spur development of specialized weaponry against this new weapon."
HLQ_rocket_artillery_f:0 "The Nebelwerfer"
HLQ_rocket_artillery_f_desc:0 "Lastly, in the reports, there was a proposal for a smokethrower or 'Nebelwerfer'. Of course, this was a cover for its real purpose, a new form for artillery that would rely on rockets, rather than shells. Certainly an idea worth pursuing for the better."
HLQ_infantry_equipment_f:0 "Retire the Antiques"
HLQ_infantry_equipment_f_desc:0 "A lot of weapons that we have lying around, and in the talons of our soldiers belongs in a museum. It is about time that we modernized our weapons for the better so that they can train with something else than valuable antiques."
HLQ_support_equipment_f:0 "Modern Support Equipment"
HLQ_support_equipment_f_desc:0 "There is also the issue of the small things such as tents, medical supplies, and so forth. Like with the weapons, they really do belong somewhere else than with out soldiers, such as a surplus store. In any case, we shall initiate another reform and revolution to make sure they have something better than worm-eating blankets."
HLQ_osttruppen:0 "Der Ostlegionen"
HLQ_osttruppen_desc:0 "We will need everycreature for the Heer. A general recently mentioned forming so-called 'Ostlegionen' to take in all those that want to serve Hellquill even if they are not citizens. They shall serve as a foreign legion to bolster our numbers (and to conserve our own kin in battle)."
HLQ_cold_training:0 "Fighting in the Winter"
HLQ_cold_training_desc:0 "Winters are strong, and they can, if coming at the wrong time, completely ruin an army's day or month. While Griffons naturally are somewhat resistant to the cold, fighting for a long time can break down everything. We shall establish training regimens to make sure that out soldiers will be able to fight through the winter and into the summer."
HLQ_hill_training:0 "Die Bergsoldaten"
HLQ_hill_training_desc:0 "To the north and to the east lies hill after hill after hill. If we are to stand any hope of fighting our way through this, we need specialized training courses for all soldiers to make sure they know their way up a hill. And down a hill."
HLQ_motorized_f:0 "Army Motorisation Effort"
HLQ_motorized_f_desc:0 "Trucks are truly the thing that will carry us into the future. They can carry goods and soldiers so much further and faster than any carriage would be able to. Stepping up our production of this should be a key ingredient in our modern army."
HLQ_mobile_tactics:0 "Combined Arms Effort"
HLQ_mobile_tactics_desc:0 "But we need to have everyone working together. While we may not subscribe to the idea of 'Friendship is Magic', camaraderie and cooperation is key in any sort of army. The infantry, artillery and knights must all work in lockstep, lest someone exploits the cracks in the paint."
HLQ_tank_development:0 "The Panzer"
HLQ_tank_development_desc:0 "The fabled new invention. The Panzer. Our people recently acquired a test model from the Empire through various means. Reverse-engineering this will be a great help in building our own models later. Perhaps it will be the envy of the world."
HLQ_medium_tanks_f:0 "The Panther"
HLQ_medium_tanks_f_desc:0 "But we need more. The flimsy armor made of corrugated iron was too brittle. No, we need a bigger tank. The codename 'Panther' has already been assigned to the new project. It is expected to soon give results that we can leverage into a new version of the Panzer. Maybe a Panther this time?"
HLQ_officer_reforms:0 "General Staff Primacy"
HLQ_officer_reforms_desc:0 ""Plans may be useless, but planning is indispensable."\n\n That shall be the watchword for our military. We shall prepare for all eventualities, and all kinds of problems. Never shall we be caught unprepared."
HLQ_volksgrenadiers:0 "Die Volksgrenadiers"
HLQ_volksgrenadiers_desc:0 "We still need more warm bodies for our armies. We shall raise reserves to be thrown in when necessary. 'Volksgrenadiers', soldiers of the people, ready to jump to the call at a moment’s notice. They will always be ready for the call, placing their trust in the nation."
HLQ_heavier_tanks:0 "Achtung Panzer!"
HLQ_heavier_tanks_desc:0 "Nothing beats speed really. Well, maybe speed when it is in a heavily armored tank with a big gun on top. When the rumblings of its engine roar across the battlefield, they will know to flee from it, lest they will be destroyed."

HLQ_luftwaffe:0 "The Luftwaffe"
HLQ_luftwaffe_desc:0 "The Airforce of Hellquill shall be our knights in the sky. They will cary on our old traditions in a new light and become the Luftwaffe."
HLQ_import_fighters:0 "Import Fighter Craft"
HLQ_import_fighters_desc:0 "The import of fighter craft from manufactories in the Empire and elsewhere will help us kickstart our air force program, and provide a backbone for future development."
HLQ_develop_fighter:0 "The Messerbeak"
HLQ_develop_fighter_desc:0 "Developing modern fighters should be a main priority for our air force division. If we are to control the skies we must do it with the best technology possible."
HLQ_CAS_f:0 "The Stuka"
HLQ_CAS_f_desc:0 "Planes that serve the purpose of directly attacking ground targets are key to the war in the sky. The enemy will flee before their tremendous firepower! Our new Stuka aircraft shall serve this purpose."
HLQ_air_superiority_f:0 "Control The Skies"
HLQ_air_superiority_f_desc:0 "Undeniably, our air philosophy should be to control the skies above the battlefield and using it to enforce our will on the war below. Rule over the air war will provide us with the tools needed to win all the battles we may encounter."
HLQ_strategic_destruction_f:0 "Burn The Fields"
HLQ_strategic_destruction_f_desc:0 "A more unorthodox tactic has recently come to the forefront of military theory in our airforce. It discards the necessity of complete battlefield control, in exchange for emphasising the destruction of enemy resources behind the lines of battle. This could be used well against many of the Order's enemies..."
HLQ_airbases:0 "The Beakstadt Air Fields"
HLQ_airbases_desc:0 "The establishment of modern airfields should be a high priority for our airforce. The necessity of locations to fly our planes out of is ever-present in discussions on strategy. To solve this a new airstrip shall be constructed around Beakstadt to serve this need."
HLQ_import_bombers:0 "Import Bombers"
HLQ_import_bombers_desc:0 "Importing bombers from across Griffonia will allow us to have a small reserve of aircraft for direct attack missions, and also serve a base for further design and manufacture."
HLQ_develop_bombers:0 "The Junker"
HLQ_develop_bombers_desc:0 "One of our most accomplished aeronautic engineers has been drafting new plans for better models of bombers for Hellquill. We should embrace these new designs and use them well."
HLQ_develop_strat_bombers:0 "The Clawnier"
HLQ_develop_strat_bombers_desc:0 "Bombers created for the sole purpose of destroying enemy infrastructure have been in development for a while now. But now, we finally have the resources to begin manufacture of these planes, and replace them should failures occur."
HLQ_airborne:0 "Create The Fallschirmjäger"
HLQ_airborne_desc:0 "Use of airborne infantry is an extremely effective tactic, especially with griffon's natural biological advantage. We should create a new airborne program in order to harness this power fully."
HLQ_develop_heavy_fighters:0 "The Jaguar"
HLQ_develop_heavy_fighters_desc:0 "The creation of a fighter plane on a larger bomber chassis that can be used for both dogfighting and ground strike missions will be a huge advancement for our air force. We should invest in this as much as we can."
HLQ_jet_experiments:0 "Jet Experiments"
HLQ_jet_experiments_desc:0 "Experimentation with jet engines has been theorised for a while now, but we finally have what we need to put it into practice. The griffons shall forever rule the skies!"

HLQ_kriegsmarine:0 "The Kriegsmarine"
HLQ_kriegsmarine_desc:0 "With the recent seizure of coastal territories for Hellquill, we can finally go about establishing a fleet for ourselves to protect our new land from any seaborne invasion. Plans have already been drafted and suitable dock locations have been approved."
HLQ_convoy_fleet:0 "The Hellquill Trade Fleet"
HLQ_convoy_fleet_desc:0 "With sea access comes more trade flowing into our nation. We must establish a new fleet of merchant convoys in order to pursue these new trade opportunities."
HLQ_destroyer_fleet:0 "Trade Escorts"
HLQ_destroyer_fleet_desc:0 "Escorting our trade ships is the main priority of our navy. New ships shall be designed to fit this purpose. It would be best to start with smaller vessels upon which we can base our future, larger blueprints."
HLQ_u_boats:0 "Adopt The U-Boat"
HLQ_u_boats_desc:0 "The U-boat is not a new innovation in naval war, but new developments are making them even more advanced. We should embrace these new ideas to create a fleet capable of striking at our enemies without huge amount of investment in large battlefleets."
HLQ_the_marine_infantry:0 "The Marine Stosstrupp"
HLQ_the_marine_infantry_desc:0 "Marines or naval assault troops will be of great use to our nation with our new coast, and the amount of rivers in our land. Investment in new marine divisions will hopefully pay large dividends."
HLQ_cruisers_f:0 "The Kreuzer"
HLQ_cruisers_f_desc:0 "Cruisers are good all-around vessels that will help us enforce our will upon the waves. We should pursue developments in this regard."
HLQ_battleships_f:0 "The Schlachtschiff"
HLQ_battleships_f_desc:0 "Battleships are the titans of the seas, if we are ever to be seen as a major naval power we will need to construct some of these iron behemoths."
HLQ_a_small_navy:0 "Raider Doctrine"
HLQ_a_small_navy_desc:0 "Forging our navy around the interception of enemy supplies and troops may seem like we are giving up control of the oceans. But it is simply to compensate for our lack of naval industry. We will project our power from below the surface..."
HLQ_a_large_navy:0 "A Surface Fleet"
HLQ_a_large_navy_desc:0 "We could never give up control of the surface! We will invest more in industry and ensure that our great ships shall never fail to bring our might upon the open waters!"
HLQ_our_own_shipyard:0 "A Home Port"
HLQ_our_own_shipyard_desc:0 "Establishing a new homeport for our navy in our coastal territory will allow for further repairs and production of naval vessels. With it, industry and employment will swiftly follow."
HLQ_naval_bombers:0 "The Naval Aviation Office"
HLQ_naval_bombers_desc:0 "The creation of aircraft for the sole purpose of attacking naval vessels should be a huge help to our navy, taking off the burden of many direct engagements."
HLQ_carries_f:0 "The Träger"
HLQ_carries_f_desc:0 "While the construction of an aircraft carrier may seem out of proportion for a nation like us, we will always strive towards greater goals, and see what we can achieve."
HLQ_expand_shipyards:0 "Expand The Shipyards"
HLQ_expand_shipyards_desc:0 "Expansion of shipyards will be a good way to increase the size and therefore capabilities of our navy. We can always use more ships, after consultation with our available reserve griffonpower, that is."

### Events ###
hellquill.1.t:0 "The Treasure of Diamond Mountain"
hellquill.1.d:0 "Over thirty years ago, our noble knights invaded the savage dogs of Diamond Mountain and plundered each and every underground vault they had. Unintelligent beasts, they only hoarded wealth for the sake of wealth, and we have used this boon in an efficient manner in the past decades, slowly improving our living standards, armed forces and more. Yet even this vast treasure has its end, and we are left with only a fraction of the original sum. The knightly council agrees that it should be invested in Hellquill's growth, but we are left divided in which method should this occur. [HLQ.GetLeader] will have the final decision on the topic."
hellquill.1.a:0 "The purpose of these riches is to hasten our industrialisation!"
hellquill.1.b:0 "This wealth should be used to improve our society, and attract immigrants."
hellquill.1.c:0 "Use the treasure to modernise our army, so that we can protect ourselves."

hellquill.2.t:0 "Siegfried's Retirement"
hellquill.2.d:0 "Grandmaster Siegfried Trappenfeld has served Hellquill well for many years, standing valiantly against both the East and the West to keep us safe. His will to lead has slowly faded over these past couple of trying years, however. Much has changed within our world and our Griffonian Continent, and Siegfried feels that he is no longer willing to lead us into this new world. The Knightly Council respected and honoured his decision greatly, though this leaves us with one big problem: a power vacuum. Who shall be our new leader? And more importantly, what will be our stance towards our enemies and our friends in this ever changing world?"
hellquill.2.a:0 "We thank you for your service."

hellquill.3.t:0 "August Takes the Helm"
hellquill.3.d:0 "August von Ortelsberg, though previously considered an outsider in the race to becoming the new head of the council, has surprisingly made it to the top, nonetheless. August managed to convince a majority of the council's members through his promises of peace and prosperity. War and rivalry, he says, have only weakened Hellquill in the past, and cost us many thousands of lives. August is also said to believe in the equality of ponies and Griffons, and he aims to establish a free and peaceful nation, which Griffons and ponies share as equals."
hellquill.3.a:0 "Let us see what he can do."

hellquill.4.t:0 "Ponies Voice Their Concerns"
hellquill.4.d:0 "Many ponies have openly voiced their concerns about griffon encroachment near their towns and villages. They feel openly endangered by living so close to Griffons, and would like to see us handle the situation."
hellquill.4.a:0 "Reassure our pony friends."

hellquill.5.t:0 "The School Debate"
hellquill.5.d:0 "There have been many debates about how our education system should integrate ponies. Progressive and liberal Griffons argue that ponies are more alike than different from us, and that a shared education system could only help our mutual understanding in the long run. The old guard and conservatives however say that ponies and Griffons do not belong together, especially not in the same classrooms. How should this situation be handled?"
hellquill.5.a:0 "There is no need for seperated schools."
hellquill.5.b:0 "Griffons and ponies each have their needs."

hellquill.6.t:0 "Black Cloak Attack"
hellquill.6.d:0 "Groups of Griffons that are said to belong to the Black Cloaks, or more formerly known as the "Reformisten", have carried out an attack on multiple pony towns last night. Travelling from town to town, they went ahead and torched every building they could find, destroy or captured food rations and shot any pony that was brave enough to oppose them. When law enforcement arrived, the raiding party was already gone, nowhere to be seen. Rumours claim that Wingfried von Katerinburg, leader of the movement, was part of these attacks himself, but no one truly knows."
hellquill.6.a:0 "This is a disaster!"

hellquill.7.t:0 "Druwi Festival"
hellquill.7.d:0 "Today our nation celebrates the Druwi Festival, an ancient tradition of the Hellquillian ponies. For a long time, this festival had to be held in secret, since many such traditions were considered illegal, at the time. This is no longer the case, however! Ponies are happy to come out of their homes and celebrate their traditions, at last!"
hellquill.7.a:0 "Swentinimai!"

hellquill.8.t:0 "Wingfried's Arrest"
hellquill.8.d:0 "Wingfried von Katerinburg was today apprehended and arrested in his home near Beakstadt. A group of officers rushed into his home and secured him before he could escape through a backdoor. With Wingfried in our captivity, we have secured the head of the disgusting Black Cloaks, at last."
hellquill.8.a:0 "Well done."

hellquill.9.t:0 "The Von Katerinburg Trial"
hellquill.9.d:0 "The Court had gathered to decide the fate of Wingfried von Katerinburg, leader of the Black Cloaks at last. The griffon in question rose up from his seat as all eyes in the room turned towards him. He looked ever so calm, and spoke out with a collected voice:\n\n"Your Honour, I wish nothing to you, your neighbour or your wife than a secure and peaceful future. All I did in my life was aimed at achieving peace for us, the Hellquillians.\nThe only thing that I realised, unlike you, is that we must fight our enemies, not invite them for dinner. Have you forgotten the past, I ask you!? Is our very nation of Hellquill not built on the very principle of standing against ponykind? Is this not the truth? If ponies are our friend and equals, then why have they willingly attacked and raided our people many times in history? Would you call those things "equals", Your Honour? Would you really?\n\nI stand on trial here today not because my motivations and ideals are wrong, but because yours are, and because they are different from them. You can silence my voice, but the people will remind you of the choices you have made, the mistakes that you have, and will make. I warn you. I warn you all. Griffons or ponies. There can only be one. I choose griffons, though I feel you are traitors to your own race."\n\nHow shall we proceed and deal with this criminal?"
hellquill.9.a:0 "Imprison him."
hellquill.9.b:0 "Exile him."
hellquill.9.c:0 "Send him to the gallows."

hellquill.10.t:0 "A New Hellquill"
hellquill.10.d:0 "Through the careful yet determined leadership of August von Ortelsberg, we have created something truly beautiful. A new Hellquill has been born, one where ponies and Griffons live together, not as enemies but as friends and as equals. And yet, while this is a great step for us all, let us march on towards the future, and secure this new Hellquill. Harmony and Friendship shall shine forever on!"
hellquill.10.a:0 "Griffons and ponies stand united!"

hellquill.11.t:0 "The Duke"
hellquill.11.d:0 "August's deeds have quickly granted him the status of a hero amongst a majority of our people, especially the ponies. Seeing as how this new Hellquill is his sole creation, we should thank him by crowning him the first Duke of Hellquill. May he remain a fair and decisive ruler, and lead us into an ever brighter future!"
hellquill.11.a:0 "Long live the Duke!"

hellquill.12.t:0 "The Republic"
hellquill.12.d:0 "August has lead us to create something greater than Hellquill has ever been: A society of equals. With this in mind, we should take the next step in assuring that Hellquill remains free and fair for all. The Republic of Hellquill shall be proclaimed!"
hellquill.12.a:0 "Long live the Republic!"

hellquill.13.t:0 "The First Election"
hellquill.13.d:0 "With the founding of the Republic, elections have been called to determine who should be our future leader. There are interesting choices to pick from, including our current head of state, August. Who do the griffons and ponies of Hellquill favour the most?"
hellquill.13.a:0 "Von Ortelsberg shall remain as President."
hellquill.13.b:0 "River Breeze of the Freedom Party becomes the President."
hellquill.13.c:0 "Colonel Reiner Guttenfried is elected President."

hellquill.14.t:0 "Officers Resign"
hellquill.14.d:0 "Following the establishment of our new leadership, a group of officers has departed and resigned from their posts. We don't know their true motives behind this move, which they have made sure to keep quiet about, but it is sad to see parts of the old guard of our forces go like this."
hellquill.14.a:0 "We're sorry to see them go."

hellquill.15.t:0 "Dealing with Longsword"
hellquill.15.d:0 "Our nation has changed a lot during these past couple of months. From an ancient knightly order, we have reformed ourselves into something greater, a place where two races can cooperate and coexist with one another. Our neighbours, friends and old allies of Longsword to the south, however, have not seen reason just yet. It is time we approached them, as friends, and invited them to join us. Only through unification can we guarantee that no further blood is shed between Griffons and ponies."
hellquill.15.a:0 "Let us talk to our friends."
hellquill.15.b:0 "Sadly, blood must be shed for unification."

hellquill.16.t:0 "An Offer From Hellquill"
hellquill.16.d:0 "Our neighbours and ancient allies to the north, Hellquill, have sent us a telegram today. It attempts to charm us and portrays our alliance and friendship in great detail, but the main point of it is Unification. The Hellquillians ask for us to surrender our nation to them for peaceful unification under their banner. All our griffons (and ponies) would receive immediate citizenship and protection from Hellquill. What should our response be? Do we unite with our friends? Or is this the time to finally break ties with them?"
hellquill.16.a:0 "We shall join them in harmony."
hellquill.16.b:0 "We politely refuse."

hellquill.17.t:0 "Longsword Accepts"
hellquill.17.d:0 "Huzzah! Our friends and allies in Longsword have seen reason in our polite request and have given in to our request for unification. Henceforth, Hellquillians and Longswordians shall stand as one, together!"
hellquill.17.a:0 "Great!"

hellquill.18.t:0 "Longsword Declines"
hellquill.18.d:0 "It appears that despite our best efforts and kindest words, Longsword has declined our request for unification. This is most unfortunate, and poses a dangerous question to us: Do we accept their decision? Or do we ensure lasting peace between ponies and Griffons by taking them by force?"
hellquill.18.a:0 "An unfortunate decision."
hellquill.18.b:0 "Forceful unification it is, then."

hellquill.19.t:0 "Urlach Becomes the New Grandmaster"
hellquill.19.d:0 "The Knightly Council has decided on the matter of Siegfried's succession: Urlach, yet another Knight, shall henceforth lead our Order into the future as Grandmaster! With a new, valiant Knight at the helm, our main focus shall lie in defending against the eastborn ponies, just as we have done for many hundreds of years. There are many problems that continue to plague our nation though, problems that must be addressed urgently."
hellquill.19.a:0 "Time to get to work."

hellquill.20.t:0 "The Fight Against Illiteracy"
hellquill.20.d:0 "It is time to take up arms against the ever-growing Illiteracy within Hellquill. No longer shall our chicks gasp in sorrow, unable to read even the most basic of texts. Schools, reading clubs and more, this is what we need, and this is what we shall have!"
hellquill.20.a:0 "Great!"

hellquill.21.t:0 "The End of Illiteracy"
hellquill.21.d:0 "We have done it! Illiteracy is finally a thing of the past, and our griffons have become skilled at writing, reading and basic mathematics. This is a great day, indeed!"
hellquill.21.a:0 "Finally!"

hellquill.22.t:0 "The Shield of Griffonkind"
hellquill.22.d:0 "A small group of Knights from Hellquill has made their way into Griffenheim this afternoon, wanting to speak with the Imperial Regent. At their head was the Grandmaster of Hellquill, Urlach. He made an inspiring speech about our old values of honour and tradition, and then kneeled down before the regent and the rest of the imperial council, pledging renewed allegiance and servitude to the Empire. We will make sure that this act of honour is not so easily forgotten. The Knightly Order returns to protect all Griffons in the Empire!"
hellquill.22.a:0 "Welcome back!"

hellquill.23.t:0 "The Knights Demand Submission"
hellquill.23.d:0 "It seems our longtime friends in Hellquill have sent us a "request" today, or rather an ultimatum. They say that, in order to ensure continued prosperity and safety for the Empire and all Griffons, we must accept unification under their banner. We would no doubt bring shame over ourselves and our ancestors if we gave up our sovereignty just like that! And yet... we don't stand a chance against Hellquill and the Empire combined. Perhaps we should just avoid a pointless bloodshed?"
hellquill.23.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept."
hellquill.23.b:0 "Never! Longsword will be free!"

hellquill.24.t:0 "Longsword Refuses"
hellquill.24.d:0 "Those fools down in Longsword have unfortunately failed to see the reason in our most reasonable request for unification. Oh well. It was their choice, after all. If it is war they seek, then war they shall get!"
hellquill.24.a:0 "To war!"

hellquill.25.t:0 "Wingfried Takes Control"
hellquill.25.d:0 "The Knightly Council has discussed the future of Hellquill in depth, and one singular Griffon has come out on top of everyone else, it seems. Wingfried von Katerinburg, founder and leader of the 'Reformisten' movement, has been elected to lead Hellquill henceforth. He has vowed to act only in the interest of Hellquill and its Griffons, deliberately ignoring and leaving out that Hellquill is still home to many Pony minorities. Wingfried and his violent ideology are renown for their views on Griffon supremacy and the concept that ponies are an evil that must be eliminated for the good of Griffonkind.\n\nOne way or another, Wingfried aims to elevate Hellquill to something beyond an ordinary Order of Knights, and shape it into something greater, something that will last for a thousand years."
hellquill.25.a:0 "For glory!"

hellquill.26.t:0 "The Old Guard Complains"
hellquill.26.d:0 "The new leadership under Wingfried has started to get rolling. Some officers within the old guard have uttered increasingly vocal complains about our policies and choices of action, however. Clearly, they're not a great fan of our ideology and policies."
hellquill.26.a:0 "We don't appreciate dissenters."

hellquill.27.t:0 "Reign of Terror"
hellquill.27.d:0 "Last night, ten minutes after midnight, it commenced.\n\nThe streets were suddenly lit up with the light of torches burning bright. Rows and mobs of Griffons marched through the streets of the capital, shouting chants along the way as they made their way to the Pony ghetto at the outskirts of the city. A group of police officers, uniformed to look just like soldiers, broke open the gate to the Ghetto, which had been previously locked to disallow the ponies from leaving their 'containment zone'.\nIt was a slaughter. After just three minutes, Houses had been set ablaze, gunshots were being fired, there were brawls between the angry mob and desperate, yet brave ponies. But it was no use. At the end of the Night, just less than an hour after it all began, the Pony ghetto fell silent once more. They were dead.\n\nThis night was but start of something much greater. All across Hellquill, Griffons are encouraged to rise up into violent mobs and attack any ponies in their area. The Government has made their position more than clear: Hellquill is a home for Griffons, ONLY Griffons."
hellquill.27.a:0 "We'll get rid of the rats eventually."

hellquill.28.t:0 "Refugees in Deponya"
hellquill.28.d:0 "Today, just after dawn, large groups of exhausted and visibly scarred ponies crossed the border between Hellquill and Deponya. They seek refuge from 'the terrors of Hellquill.' Generous and helpful families have decided to allow these ponies safe refuge within their homes until the government has a place to permanently house them in, or until this situation is otherwise resolved. The question remains however: What exactly did happen in Hellquill? What are they running from? And... should we be scared, too?"
hellquill.28.a:0 "This is an ill omen."

hellquill.29.t:0 "Education Effort"
hellquill.29.d:0 "The governments of the past have been horribly neglective of educational efforts and institutions. As such, illiteracy has sky-rocketed and threatens to consume our nation. Thankfully, it is not too late, just yet. We will turn the tide in this battle against illiteracy!"
hellquill.29.a:0 "We can resolve this issue."

hellquill.30.t:0 "Education Efforts Finished"
hellquill.30.d:0 "At last, our educational efforts have shown their effect on the people, and our crisis has been overcome. The Griffons of Hellquill shall henceforth remain at the forefront of education!"
hellquill.30.a:0 "Good to hear."

hellquill.31.t:0 "The Kingdom of Hellquill"
hellquill.31.d:0 "Our great leader Wingfried has decided that today is time. This very afternoon, he assembled the government, military and the press to announce whole-heartedly to them all that Hellquill's new order will bring greatness to us and all Griffons. He proclaimed himself King of Hellquill, claiming that his crown shall remain an instrument of power for a thousand years! His legitimacy derives from his old bloodline and his relationship to the Princess of Katerin. Never before has a von Katerinburg worn a kingly crown on his head, but Wingfried sees himself as exceptional in many ways. His subjects rejoice, and the military is eager for what is to come."
hellquill.31.a:0 "This Kingdom shall last a thousand years!"

hellquill.32.t:0 "Role of the Sturmgreifen"
hellquill.32.d:0 "The Sturmgreifen, our new elite forces, have been a topic of debate, as of recent. There is a discussion about their precise role within the armed forces, namely an aggressive and direct role at the frontline by giving them their own regiments within the army, or a more supportive role by stationing their soldiers behind the Frontline and in recon battalions to more effectively aid our troops. Both suggestions sound reasonable, but only one is possible. Which one will it be?"
hellquill.32.a:0 "Give them their own regiments."
hellquill.32.b:0 "Give them a support role."

hellquill.33.t:0 "The Hellquillian Request"
hellquill.33.d:0 "The griffons of Hellquill have approached us with a request for protection, namely a formal guarantee of independence. Our advisors are split on the matter, though Hellquill argues that their safety is in the best interest of the Empire, as well. On the other claw, protecting Hellquill means we might get dragged into a war with the entire River Coaliation. How shall we proceed?"
hellquill.33.a:0 "We shall guarantee them."
hellquill.33.b:0 "They don't deserve our protection."

hellquill.34.t:0 "The Empire Accepts"
hellquill.34.d:0 "The Empire has shown reason and accepted our request for a gurantee. Our safety should henceforth be ensured."
hellquill.34.a:0 "Hellquill is safe!"

hellquill.35.t:0 "The Empire Refuses"
hellquill.35.d:0 "Despite our best diplomatic attempts, the Imperials have refused to guarantee our Independence from any foreign force. We tried to tell them that our well-being was in their best interest, as well, but to no avail. We stand alone."
hellquill.35.a:0 "There is always next time..."

hellquill.36.t:0 "The Hellquillian Request"
hellquill.36.d:0 "The griffons of Hellquill have approached us within the capital today, not to declare war (for once) but to commence diplomatic talks. It appears that they have had a huge change of heart over these last few months, resulting in a much less aggressive stance overall and the creation of a new society where ponies and griffons in Hellquill can live together in peace. Now, they seek us out for formal support and a guarantee of independence. Is this a good idea?"
hellquill.36.a:0 "We shall guarantee them."
hellquill.36.b:0 "They don't deserve our protection."

hellquill.37.t:0 "The Federation Accepts"
hellquill.37.d:0 "We've done it! The ponies of the River Federation have come to peace with us and our past, at long last. As such, they have agreed to guarantee our independence from any outside invader. This will aid our diplomatic effort towards the ponies, and protect us from any threat on the continent."
hellquill.37.a:0 "Most excellent!"

hellquill.38.t:0 "The Federation Refuses"
hellquill.38.d:0 "Unfortunately, despite our best intentions and efforts, the ponies of the River Federation have refused us and our polite request. Perhaps it was too early to attempt a rapproachment with the ponies."
hellquill.38.a:0 "There is always next time..."

hellquill.39.t:0 "Hellquillian Membership"
hellquill.39.d:0 "The Griffons of Hellquill aim to work together with us to ensure our mutual safety it seems, as they have sent a formal request to join the River Coalition. While this might seem very nice in spirit, it could also upset many other members, seeing as how the Coalition itself was founded by defending against the Griffons."
hellquill.39.a:0 "We welcome them to the Coalition."
hellquill.39.b:0 "We don't need their kind here."

hellquill.40.t:0 "Honourary Membership Granted"
hellquill.40.d:0 "Rejoice! The ponies have granted us an honourary membership as part of the Coalition. Henceforth, we shall be close allies of the ponies!"
hellquill.40.a:0 "Wonderful news!"

hellquill.41.t:0 "Honourary Membership Declined"
hellquill.41.d:0 "Black news. It appears that our best efforts have failed, and the Riverponies have refused our request to join their Coalition."
hellquill.41.a:0 "I'm sure they'll accept us eventually!"

hellquill.42.t:0 "The Purple Plague"
hellquill.42.d:0 "A great tragedy has struck us all! Thousands of ponies lie dead in the streets of our cities, and smaller villages have turned into ghost towns, inhabited only by the deceased corpses of the ponies who once prospered there.\n\nThe vile regime of Hellquill, lead by the disgusting and racist Wingfried von Katerinburg, has treated ponies like dirt before, even cutting defenceless families down with sabers in an effort to destroy the pony population of Hellquill. Now, these acts have grown too big to ignore, and too vile to tolerate.\n\nPonies in Hellquill were apprehended and experimented upon by griffon scientists. It appears that there, the scientists infected the ponies with a terrifying and deadly virus, the purple plague as it is called. Then, they sent hundreds, if not over a thousand of these infected individuals east, into our lands. Anypony that got close to them was almost doomed to die, and this disease has already killed entire countrysides and half the population of certain cities in the River Federation, with the death toll steadily increasing.\n\nWe must take action against these thugs and racists in Hellquill. We can no longer tolerate their actions, nor do we have the choice to look the other way. The Governments of the River Federation have agreed in absolute unison:\n\nWe are going to war. The Griffons will pay!"
hellquill.42.a:0 "We'll kill those conniving bastards!"

hellquill.43.t:0 "A Plea from [From.GetNameDef]"
hellquill.43.d:0 "An envoy has arrived in great haste today at the Imperial Palace, begging the Emperor and the Regent for help. After we've got the griffon to calm down and explain his issue, he has revealed that the [From.GetName] is under grave threat, and require immediate assistance lest the Empire's eastern borders become threatened. While we regard the eastern lands as our rightful territory, we might not be able to properly cover the front, given the current situation in the rest of Griffonia. How do we respond to the envoy?"
hellquill.43.a:0 "Give them aid, but demand vassalage!"
hellquill.43.b:0 "We cannot offer them help in these difficult times."

hellquill.44.t:0 "The Empire Accepts our Plea"
hellquill.44.d:0 "The Empire has decided to bring us aid in our darkest hour. While we will have to recognise their sovereignty over us, it is preferable to total destruction."
hellquill.44.a:0 "Better to live on our knees than die standing!"

hellquill.45.t:0 "The Empire Rejects our Plea"
hellquill.45.d:0 "Unfortunately, the Empire has declined to bring us aid in our darkest hour. The envoy brought the bad news while barely suppressing his tears. We are left on our own against the invader..."
hellquill.45.a:0 "Boreas, preserve us..."

hellquill.46.t:0 "The Empire Demands Submission!"
hellquill.46.d:0 "A letter has arrived today, bearing the Emperor's seal. What could prompt the Empire to turn their attention to us? A cursory reading reveals that the Empire demands their rightful vassal, the Knightly Order of Hellquill, to place themselves under the Empire's aegis, for the Riverponies have risen up in vast numbers to destroy the griffon way of life. While we've remained neutral thus far in the conflict, there's no telling when the ponies will turn their attention on ourselves. How shall respond to the Emperor?"
hellquill.46.a:0 "The ponies are a great threat, we must submit."
hellquill.46.b:0 "We can handle the ponies on our own!"

hellquill.47.t:0 "[From.GetName] Submits"
hellquill.47.d:0 "The leader of [From.GetName], [From.GetLeader] has arrived today in [Root.Capital.GetName] to swear oaths of fealty to the Emperor. Predictably, they have bowed before our might."
hellquill.47.a:0 "We welcome our new vassal."

hellquill.48.t:0 "A Diplomatic Insult!"
hellquill.48.d:0 "Outrage! [From.GetLeader], the leader of [From.GetName] has rejected our rightful demand, claiming they don't need our protection against the Riverpony extremists! They need to be taught a lesson in manners, and know to bow before their betters!"
hellquill.48.a:0 "Their lands are forfeit to us!"

hellquill_news.1.t:0 "Purple Plague Unleashed!"
hellquill_news.1.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]The Kingdom of Hellquill is notorious for its rabid hatred of ponies, but most assumed they would be content after deporting them from their lands. This half truth was quickly proven deeply wrong.\nAcross the Riverlands in eastern Griffonia, ponies were falling ill to the previously extinct disease known as the Purple Plague. At first, it was believed to be an isolated outbreak, were it not for Hellquill recently proclaiming that they had brought doom upon the ponies. This vicious virus spread at an alarming rate, with a staggering death toll thus far, caused entirely by Hellquill infecting healthy ponies and sending them back to their homes.\nThe Riverponies have put aside their differences and united as one to cast down the vile regime. Unfortunately, even if they are successful, nothing will bring back thousands of ponies that are already lost."

### Leader Descriptions ###
retires_in_a_month_desc:0 "Current Grandmaster of the Hellquillian Order of Knights, Siegfried Trappenfeld has seen many battles in his lifetime, and is respected by all for his unwavering dedication, boldness and being the paradigm of a knight. His decision to cut ties with the failing Griffonian Empire was a pragmatic choice based on preserving their endless duty, the defence of the eastern borders against the pony menace. Although he is concerned about the growing extremist element in Hellquill, Siegfried remains confident that Hellquill will remain like it has always been, a bulwark to protect the griffon way of life."
griffon_hitler_desc:0 "Most griffons you'd ask wouldn't know how Wingfried von Katerinburg became so characteristically hateful of ponies. Some say it was a traumatic event early in his lifetime, others say it is a result of fighting on the borders for so long. A few even whisper it is nothing more than inherited madness that is shared by his cousin, Diellza von Katerinburg. Nevertheless, Wingfried made the complete and total ruination of the eastern Riverpony nations the key policy in the new Hellquill. With Hellquill united behind him, von Katerinburg will fight to the last breath in order to achieve his goal."
wholesome_nerd_desc:0 "Former head archivist of the Hellquillian Order, August von Ortelsberg had spent many hours documenting and researching the knightly order's history. He has repeatedly reached the conclusion that the conflict between ponies and griffons is immensely destructive and has achieved nothing positive for anygriff or pony. His continuous pleas to the Grandmaster fell on deaf ears, and when the latter stepped down, August's exasperation only grew, comprehending that his attempts to foster peace would never be realised. Thus, he was pleasantly surprised when the Knightly Council has chosen him for the new Grandmaster of the Order, and he now does his best to mend the wounded relationship between ponies and griffons, in order to create a new and harmonious Hellquill. "
siegfried_2_0_desc:0 "Urlach ap Cyrod, a veteran knight who earned his mettle from a dozen campaigns, is a staunch traditionalist and believer in the Hellquillian ideals. A natural choice for the newest Grandmaster, Urlach seeks to continue his mentor Siegfried's legacy and preserve Hellquill's role in the world. While he has some adverse views on the ponies, he is pragmatic enough to avoid antagonising them and is open to the idea of reestablishing ties with the Griffonian Empire, should there be no other choice."
fake_pants_desc:0 "River Breeze's family has lived in Hellquill all their lives, and despite the intense griffonisation they were subjected to, they never considered moving to friendlier lands. Instead, they've adopted large parts of the griffon culture, with River Breeze himself becoming a priest of Arcturius. While this wasn't the future he had in mind for himself, being pressured by his relatives, he has come to appreciate the position. Seeing the faithful griffons and ponies moved something in him, especially after prosecutions began, led by the vile Wingfried. He has repeatedly shielded his pony flock from the Reformisten, using his knowledge of the faith to shame them away, and in return, the community has rallied around him. As such, when the first elections were organised in the newly liberal Hellquill, he was a natural choice for president."
should_have_picked_ortelsberg_desc:0 "Reiner Guttenfried has had an unassuming service in the order's military, following orders to the letter, but never truly distinguishing himself. However, his claim to prominence comes from his dedication to the soldiers' wellbeing, so much that everygriff who served under him couldn't say a single disparaging word. Thus, he developed a reputation of a firm but fair commander, who would protect the pony minorities from other, more radically minded units. He was surprised to see himself winning the first elections, having campaigned only to satisfy his friends in the army, but the ponies and griffons of Hellquill have recognised the need for a character of sterner stock to lead them in these trying times."
HLQ_eisen_desc:0 "§gOriginating from Brodfeld, Eisen was born into a peasant family in 971 ALB, on the border near the Gryphian Host. He and his brother, Sycle Coroanargint, would at a young age witness a Cossack raid while on an errand near the countryside. His brother was amazed by the cossacks, and would begin to dedicate most of his free time learning about the military, art of war and politics. What Sycle didn't realise however, was that he had accidentaly neglected his younger brother, who became bitter over the lack of attention from his older brother, who he had considered a role model of sorts.\n\n To earns his brother's attention again, he joined the cossacks as a volunteer when he reached the age of 18. Over time he grew attached to the group he was travelling with, and considered them friends he never had before. But in 992 ALB, a raid on Lake City went completely wrong. The Cossacks all died during the attack, and Eisen was scared from a pony sword, his beak cracked from the impact. Suprisingly, the ponies had though him dead while he lay unconscious, and he miraculously survived.  The impact of losing the ones he held most dear broke him emotionally, and in this mentally unstable state, he begun the blame the ponies for this misfortune.\n\n Broken and angry, he returned to Brodfeld, only hear that a pony named Applethorn, a communist from Farbook, was helping the revolution in Brodfeld, his own country. Enraged, Eisen headed to inform his brother of what the ponies had done to him and his country, and that they must be punished. Sycle, understanding that the fault lied on the claws of the griffons, not the ponies, ignored his brother's ramblings, once again neglecting his already unstable younger brother. Eisen, betrayed by his own brother, became broken, without a purpose. This changed when he heard of the reformisten in Hellquill, and he begun to march north in search of them. Hearing Wingfried's speeches about "the pony menace" radicalises Eisen, and he would soon join the reformisten, changing his surname to Silberkrone. With this newfound purpose, he became a fanatic for the cause, eventually rising up the ranks of the party, finally to the leader of the Sturmgreifen.§!"

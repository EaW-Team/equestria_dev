HLQ_industrial_revolution:0 "The Eastern Industrial Revolution"

HLQ_free_transit:0 "The Neuland Act"
HLQ_free_transit_desc:0 "We can't ignore that there is still a parallel society of Ponies living within our borders. This is unacceptable, to say the least. The new Neuland or 'New Land' Act will start a grand campaign of resettlement, and will aim to colonise all parts of Hellquill with Griffons, and as a result will hopefully push the pesky Ponies out of our nation."
HLQ_invite_longsword_2:0 "Demand Longswordian Submission"
HLQ_invite_longsword_2_desc:0 "Longsword has been a long-standing ally and friend of ours. Together, we faced the wrath of the East time and again, and yet we remained valiant in our defence.

HLQ_incorporate_blackcloaks_desc:0 "While Wingfried von Katerinburg is without a question the most radical of the radical in Hellquill, his movement and ideas incorporate a hatred for ponies which we very much share.

HLQ_paramilitaries_in_the_streets_desc:0 "Our Police force is not strong enough to keep the Ponies and dissidents in line. Wingfried has proposed to militarise them by turning them into paramilitary groups which any fanatic teen can apply for. This will not only show young Griffons the strength of the new Hellquill, but it will also keep the pressure on our domestic enemies."
HLQ_not_safe_at_home:0 "Organise the Geheimdienst"

HLQ_test_subjects:0 "Group 935"
HLQ_test_subjects_desc:0 "Seeing as how Ponies are nothing but rats either way, our scientists have requested to use them as test subjects for dangerous experiments. It helps our research effort and saves us a few bullets, so there is nothing speaking against it."
HLQ_beasts_of_labour:0 "Beasts of Burden"
HLQ_beasts_of_labour_desc:0 "The Conquest of eastern lands means that we will occupy the lands of ponies. Obviously, it shall not remain pony land, and the ponies themselves, as the vermin that they truly are, will be turned into expendable resources of the industry. Simple workhorses for our nation.

HLQ_industry_11:0 "Support the Silver Skies Mining Company"
HLQ_industry_11_desc:0 "The Mining company of Silver Skies has discovered new, more efficient ways to mine natural resources. These new methods would prove even more effective should we lend them our hand with a sponsorship. We would do well to show him them support."

HLQ_army_4:0 "Lightning Warfare"
HLQ_army_4_desc:0 "Speed. From the earliest era of our nation, our flying troops have been known for their speed. That has been hard to adapt to modern times, but that does not make it impossible."

HLQ_army_11:0 "Dedicated Support Squads"
HLQ_army_11_desc:0 "Just like a new level in a castle, an expanded military is only as good as the supports that hold it up. We must focus not only on our front line troops, but also those griffons which will ensure it fights at maximum efficiency."
HLQ_army_7:0 "Trucking to Jezerograd"

HLQ_air_5:0 "Heavier Fighter Models"

hellquill.1.t:0 "The Treasure of Diamond Mountain"
hellquill.1.d:0 "We have acquired vast riches from the Diamond Mountain provinces. This treasure is desired by many, and yet it is our choice how we wish to spend it."
hellquill.1.a:0 "Use the treasure to help the industrialization process"
hellquill.1.b:0 "Use the treasure to attract more colonists"
hellquill.1.c:0 "Use the treasure to help modernize the army"

hellquill.2.t:0 "Siegfried's Retirement"
hellquill.2.d:0 "Grandmaster Siegfried Trappenfeld has served Hellquill well for many years, standing valiantly against both the East and the West to keep us safe. His will to lead has slowly faded over these past couple of trying years, however. Much has changed within our world and our Griffonian Continent, and Siegfried feels that he is no longer willing to lead us into this new world. The Knightly Council respected and honoured his decision greatly, though this leaves us with one big problem: a power vacuum. Who shall be our new leader? And more importantly, what will be our stance towards our enemies and our friends in this ever changing world?"
hellquill.2.a:0 "We thank you for your service"

hellquill.3.t:0 "August Takes the Helm"
hellquill.3.d:0 "August von Ortelsberg, though previously considered an outsider in the race to becoming the new head of the council, has surprisingly made it to the top, nonetheless. August managed to convince a majority of the council's members through his promises of peace and prosperity. War and rivalry, he says, have only weakened Hellquill in the past, and cost us many thousands of lives. August is also said to believe in the equality of Ponies and Griffons, and he aims to establish a free and peaceful nation, which Griffons and Ponies share as equals."
hellquill.3.a:0 "Let us see what he can do"

hellquill.4.t:0 "Ponies Voice Their Concerns"
hellquill.4.d:0 "Many ponies have openly voiced their concerns about Griffon encroachment near their towns and villages. They feel openly endangered by living so close to Griffons, and would like to see us handle the situation."
hellquill.4.a:0 "Reassure our Pony friends"

hellquill.5.t:0 "The School Debate"
hellquill.5.d:0 "There have been many debates about how our education system should integrate Ponies. Progressive and liberal Griffons argue that Ponies are moe alike than different from us, and that a shared education system could only help our mutual understanding in the long run. The old guard and conservatives however say that Ponies and Griffons do not belong together, especially not in the same classrooms. How should this situation be handled?"
hellquill.5.a:0 "There is no need for seperated schools"
hellquill.5.b:0 "Griffons and Ponies each have their needs"

hellquill.6.t:0 "Black Cloak Attack"
hellquill.6.d:0 "Groups of Griffons that are said to belong to the Black Cloaks, or more formerly known as the 'Reformisten', have carried out an attack on multiple pony towns last night. Travelling from town to town, they went ahead and torched every building they could find, destroy or captured food rations and shot any pony that was brave enough to oppose them. When law enforcement arrived, the raiding party was already gone, nowhere to be seen. Rumours claim that Wingfried von Katerinburg, leader of the movement, was part of these attacks himself, but no one truly knows."
hellquill.6.a:0 "This is a disaster!"

hellquill.7.t:0 "Druwi Festival"
hellquill.7.d:0 "Today our nation celebrates the Druwi Festival, an ancient tradition of the Griffonian Ponies. For a long time, this festival had to be held in secret, since many such traditions were considered illegal, at the time. This is no longer the case, however! Ponies are happy to come out of their homes and celebrate their traditions, at last!"
hellquill.7.a:0 "Swentinimai!"

hellquill.8.t:0 "Wingfried's Arrest"
hellquill.8.d:0 "Wingfried von Katerinburg was today apprehended and arrested in his home near Beakstadt. A group of officers rushed into his home and secured him before he could escape through a backdoor. With Wingfried in our captivity, we have secured the head of the disgusting Black Cloaks, at last."
hellquill.8.a:0 "Well done"

hellquill.9.t:0 "The Von Katerinburg Trial"
hellquill.9.d:0 "The Court had gathered to decide the fate of Wingfried von Katerinburg, leader of the Black Cloaks at last. The Griffon in question rose up from his seat as all eyes in the room turned towards him. He looked ever so calm, and spoke out with a collected voice:\n\n"Your Honour, I wish nothing to you, your neighbour or your wife than a secure and peaceful future. All I did in my life was aimed at achieving peace for us, the Hellquillians.\nThe only thing that I realised, unlike you, is that we must fight our enemies, not invite them for dinner. Have you forgotten the past, I ask you!? Is our very nation of Hellquill not built on the very principle of standing against ponykind? Is this not the truth? If Ponies are our friend and equals, then why have they willingly attacked and raided our people many times in history? Would you call those things 'equals', your honour? Would you really?\n\nI stand on trial here today not because my motivations and ideals are wrong, but because yours are, and because they are different from them. You can silence my voice, but the people will remind you of the choices you have made, the mistakes that you have, and will make. I warn you. I warn you all. Griffons or Ponies. There can only be one. I choose Griffons, though I feel you are traitors to your own race."\n\nHow shall we proceed and deal with this criminal?"
hellquill.9.a:0 "Imprison him"
hellquill.9.b:0 "Exile him"
hellquill.9.c:0 "Send him to the gallows"

hellquill.10.t:0 "A New Hellquill"
hellquill.10.d:0 "Through the careful yet determined leadership of August von Ortelsberg, we have created something truly beautiful. A new Hellquill has been born, one where Ponies and Griffons live together, not as enemies but as friends and as equals. And yet, while this is a great step for us all, let us march on towards the future, and secure this new Hellquill. Harmony and Friendship shall shine forever on!"
hellquill.10.a:0 "Griffons and Ponies stand united!"

hellquill.11.t:0 "The Duke"
hellquill.11.d:0 "August's deeds have quickly granted him the status of a hero amongst a majority of our people, especially the Ponies. Seeing as how this new Hellquill is his sole creation, we should thank him by crowning him the first Duke of Hellquill. May he remain a fair and decisive ruler, and lead us into an ever brighter future!"
hellquill.11.a:0 "Long live the Duke!"

hellquill.12.t:0 "The Republic"
hellquill.12.d:0 "August has lead us to create something greater than Hellquill has ever been: A society of equals. With this in mind, we should take the next step in assuring that Hellquill remains free and fair for all. The Republic of Hellquill shall be proclaimed!"
hellquill.12.a:0 "Long live the Republic!"

hellquill.13.t:0 "The First Election"
hellquill.13.d:0 "With the founding of the Republic, elections have been called to determine who should be our future leader. There are interesting choices to pick from, including our current head of state, August. Who do the Griffons and Ponies of Hellquill favour the most?"
hellquill.13.a:0 "Von Ortelsberg shall remain as President"
hellquill.13.b:0 "River Breeze of the Freedom Party becomes the President"
hellquill.13.c:0 "Colonel Reiner Guttenfried is elected President"

hellquill.14.t:0 "Officers Resign"
hellquill.14.d:0 "Following the establishment of our new Leadership, a group of Officers has departed and resigned from their posts. We don't know their true motives behind this move, which they have made sure to keep quiet about, but it is sad to see parts of the Old Guard of our forces go like this."
hellquill.14.a:0 "We're sorry to see them go"

hellquill.15.t:0 "Dealing with Longsword"
hellquill.15.d:0 "Our Nation has changed a lot during these past couple of months. From an ancient knightly Order, we have reformed ourselves into something greater, a place where two races can cooperate and coexist with one another. Our neighbours, friends and old allies of Longsword to the south, however, have not seen reason just yet. It is time we approached them, as friends, and invited them to join us. Only through Unification can we guarantee that no further blood is shed between Griffons and Ponies."
hellquill.15.a:0 "Let us talk to our friends"
hellquill.15.b:0 "Sadly blood must be shed for unification"

hellquill.16.t:0 "An Offer From Hellquill"
hellquill.16.d:0 "Our neighbours and ancient allies to the north, Hellquill, have sent us a telegram today. It attempts to charm us and portrays our alliance and friendship in great detail, but the main point of it is Unification. The Hellquillians ask for us to surrender our nation to them for peaceful unification under their banner. All our griffons (and ponies) would receive immediate citizenship and protection from Hellquill. What should our response be? Do we unite with our friends? Or is this the time to finally break ties with them?"
hellquill.16.a:0 "Join Them"
hellquill.16.b:0 "Politely Refuse"

hellquill.17.t:0 "Longsword Accepts"
hellquill.17.d:0 "Huzzah! Our friends and allies in Longsword have seen reason in our polite request and have given in to our request for Unification. Henceforth, Hellquillians and Longswordians shall stand as one, together!"
hellquill.17.a:0 "Great!"

hellquill.18.t:0 "Longsword Declines"
hellquill.18.d:0 "It appears that despite our best efforts and kindest words, Longsword has declined our request for Unification. This is most unfortunate, and poses a dangerous question to us: Do we accept their decision? Or do we ensure lasting peace between Ponies and Griffons by taking them by force?"
hellquill.18.a:0 "An Unfortunate decision"
hellquill.18.b:0 "Forceful Unification it is, then"

hellquill.19.t:0 "Urlach Takes the Helm"
hellquill.19.d:0 "The Knightly Council has decided on the matter of Siegfried's succession: Urlach, yet another Knight, shall henceforth lead our Order into the future as Grandmaster! With a new, valiant Knight at the helm, our main focus shall lie in defending against the East, just as we have done for many hundreds of years. There are many problems that continue to plague our nation though, problems that must be addressed urgently."
hellquill.19.a:0 "Time to get to work"

hellquill.20.t:0 "The Fight Against Illiteracy"
hellquill.20.d:0 "It is time to take up arms against the ever-growing Illiteracy within Hellquill. No longer shall our chicks gasp in sorrow, unable to read even the most basic of texts. Schools, reading clubs and more, this is what we need, and this is what we shall have!"
hellquill.20.a:0 "Great!"

hellquill.21.t:0 "The End"
hellquill.21.d:0 "We have done it! Illiteracy is finally a thing of the past, as our Griffons have become skilled at writing and reading. This is a great day, indeed!"
hellquill.21.a:0 "Finally!"

hellquill.22.t:0 "The Shield of Griffonkind"
hellquill.22.d:0 "A small group of Knights from Hellquill has made their way into Griffenheim this afternoon, wanting to speak with the imperial regent. At their head was the Grandmaster of Hellquill, Urlach. He made an inspiring speech about our old values of honour and tradition, and then kneeled down before the regent and the rest of the imperial council, pledging renewed allegiance and servitude to the Empire. We will make sure that this act of honour is not so easily forgotten. The Knightly Order returns to protect all Griffons in the Empire!"
hellquill.22.a:0 "Welcome back!"

hellquill.23.t:0 "The Knights Demand Submission"
hellquill.23.d:0 "It seems our longtime friends in Hellquill have sent us a 'request' today, or rather an ultimatum. They say that, in order to ensure continued prosperity and safety for the Empire and all Griffons, we must accept unification under their banner. We would no doubt bring shame over ourselves and our ancestors if we gave up our sovereignty just like that! And yet... we don't stand a chance against Hellquill and the Empire combined. Perhaps we should just avoid a pointless bloodshed?"
hellquill.23.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept"
hellquill.23.b:0 "Never! Longsword will be free!"

hellquill.24.t:0 "Longsword Refuses"
hellquill.24.d:0 "Those fools down in Longsword have unfortunately failed to see the reason in our most reasonable request for Unification. Oh well. It was their choice, after all. If it is war they seek, then war they shall get!"
hellquill.24.a:0 "To War!"

hellquill.25.t:0 "Wingfried Takes the Helm"
hellquill.25.d:0 "The Knightly Council has discussed the future of Hellquill in depth, and one singular Griffon has come out on top of everyone else, it seems. Wingfried von Katerinburg, founder and leader of the 'Reformisten' movement, has been elected to lead Hellquill henceforth. He has vowed to act only in the interest of Hellquill and its Griffons, deliberately ignoring and leaving out that Hellquill is still home to many Pony minorities. Wingfried and his violent ideology are renown for their views on Griffon supremacy and the concept that Ponies are an evil that must be eliminated for the good of Griffonkind.\n\nOne way or another, Wingfried aims to elevate Hellquill to something beyond an ordinary Order of Knights, and shape it into something greater, something that will last for a thousand years."
hellquill.25.a:0 "For Glory!"

hellquill.26.t:0 "The Old Guard Complains"
hellquill.26.d:0 "The new leadership under Wingfried has started to get rolling. Some Officers within the Old Guard have uttered increasingly vocal complains about our policies and choices of action, however. Clearly, they're not a great fan of our ideology and policies."
hellquill.26.a:0 "We don't appreciate dissenters"

hellquill.27.t:0 "Reign of Terror"
hellquill.27.d:0 "Last night, ten minutes after midnight, it commenced.\n\nThe Streets were suddenly lit up with the light of torches burning bright. Rows and mobs of Griffons marched through the streets of the capital, shouting chants along the way as they made their way to the Pony ghetto at the outskirts of the city. A group of police officers, uniformed to look just like soldiers, broke open the gate to the Ghetto, which had been previously locked to disallow the Ponies from leaving their 'containment zone'.\nIt was a slaughter. After just three minutes, Houses had been set ablaze, gunshots were being fired, there were brawls between the angry mob and desperate, yet brave Ponies. But it was no use. At the end of the Night, just less than an hour after it all began, the Pony ghetto fell silent once more. They were dead.\n\nThis night was but start of something much greater. All across Hellquill, Griffons are encouraged to rise up into violent mobs and attack any Ponies in their area. The Government has made their position more than clear: Hellquill is a home for Griffons, ONLY Griffons."
hellquill.27.a:0 "We'll get rid of the rats eventually"

hellquill.28.t:0 "Refugees in Desponia"
hellquill.28.d:0 "Today, just after dawn, large groups of exhausted and visibly scarred Ponies crossed the border between Hellquill and Deponya. They seek refuge from 'the terrors of Hellquill.' Generous and helpful families have decided to allow these ponies safe refuge within their homes until the government has a place to permanently house them in, or until this situation is otherwise resolved. The question remains however: What exactly did happen in Hellquill? What are they running from? And... should we be scared, too?"
hellquill.28.a:0 "This is an ill omen"

hellquill.29.t:0 "Education Effort"
hellquill.29.d:0 "The governments of the past have been horribly neglective of educational efforts and institutions. As such, our Illiteracy has sky-rocketed and threatens to consume our nation. Thankfully, it is not too late, just yet. We will turn the tide in this battle against Illiteracy!"
hellquill.29.a:0 "Let's do this!"

hellquill.30.t:0 "Education Efforts Finished"
hellquill.30.d:0 "At last, our educational efforts have shown their effect on the people, and our crisis has been overcome. The Griffons of Highhill shall henceforth remain at the forefront of Education!"
hellquill.30.a:0 "Good to hear"

hellquill.31.t:0 "The Kingdom of Hellquill"
hellquill.31.d:0 "Our great Leader Wingfried has decided that today is time. This very afternoon, he assembled the government, military and the press to announce whole-heartedly to them all that Hellquill's new order will bring greatness to us and all Griffons. He proclaimed himself King of Hellquill, claiming that his crown shall remain an instrument of power for a thousand years! His subjects rejoice, and the military is eager for what is to come. Let us not waste any time: Onwards! A thousand years of glory await!"
hellquill.31.a:0 "To a thousand years!"

hellquill.32.t:0 "Role of the Sturmgreifen"
hellquill.32.d:0 "The Sturmgreifen, our new elite forces, have been a topic of debate, as of recent. There is a discussion about their precise role within the armed forces, namingly an aggressive and direct role at the frontline by giving them their own regiments within the army, or a more supportive role by stationing their soldiers behind the Frontline and in recon battalions to more effectively aid our troops. Both suggestions sound reasonable, but only one is possible. Which one will it be?"
hellquill.32.a:0 "Give them their own regiments"
hellquill.32.b:0 "Give them a support role"

hellquill.33.t:0 "The Hellquillian Request"
hellquill.33.d:0 "The Griffons of Hellquill have approached us with a request for protection, namingly a formal guarantee of Independence. Our advisors are split on the matter, though Hellquill argues that their safety is in the best interest of the Empire, as well."
hellquill.33.a:0 "We shall gurantee them"
hellquill.33.b:0 "They don't deserve our protection"

hellquill.34.t:0 "The Empire Accepts"
hellquill.34.d:0 "The Empire has shown reason and accepted our request for a gurantee. Our safety should henceforth be ensured."
hellquill.34.a:0 "Great!"

hellquill.35.t:0 "The Empire Refuses"
hellquill.35.d:0 "Despite our best diplomatic attempts, the Imperials have refused to guarantee our Independence from any foreign force. We tried to tell them that our well-being was in their best interest, as well, but to no avail. We stand alone."
hellquill.35.a:0 "There is always next time..."

hellquill.36.t:0 "The Hellquillian Request"
hellquill.36.d:0 "The Griffons of Hellquill have approached us within the capital today, not to declare war (for once) but to commence diplomatic talks. It appears that they have had a huge change of heart over these last few months, resulting in a much less aggressive stance overall and the creation of a new society where Ponies and Griffons in Hellquill can live together in peace. Now, they seek us out for formal support and a gurantee of Independence. Is this a good idea?"
hellquill.36.a:0 "We shall gurantee them"
hellquill.36.b:0 "They don't deserve our protection"

hellquill.37.t:0 "The Federation Accepts"
hellquill.37.d:0 "We've done it! The Ponies of the River Federation have come to peace with us and our past, at long last. As such, they have agreed to guarantee our Independence from any outside invader. This will aid our diplomatic effort towards the Ponies, and protect us from any threat on the Continent."
hellquill.37.a:0 "Great!"

hellquill.38.t:0 "The Federation Refuses"
hellquill.38.d:0 "Unfortunately, despite our best intentions and efforts, the Ponies of the River Federation have refused us and our polite request. Perhaps it was too early to attempt a rapproachment with the Ponies."
hellquill.38.a:0 "There is always next time..."

hellquill.39.t:0 "Hellquillian Membership"
hellquill.39.d:0 "The Griffons of Hellquill aim to work together with us to ensure our mutual safety it seems, as they have sent a formal request to join the River Coalition. While this might seem very nice in spirit, it could also upset many other members, seeing as how the Coalition itself was founded by defending against the Griffons."
hellquill.39.a:0 "We welcome them to the Coalition"
hellquill.39.b:0 "We don't need their kind here"

hellquill.40.t:0 "Honourary Membership Granted"
hellquill.40.d:0 "Rejoice! The Ponies have granted us an honourary membership as part of the Coalition. Henceforth, we shall be close allies of the Ponies!"
hellquill.40.a:0 "Great!"

hellquill.41.t:0 "Honourary Membership Declined"
hellquill.41.d:0 "Black news. It appears that our best efforts have failed, and the River Ponies have refused our request to join their Coalition."
hellquill.41.a:0 "I'm sure they'll accept us eventually!"

hellquill.42.t:0 "The Purple Plague"
hellquill.42.d:0 "A great tragedy has struck us all! Thousands of ponies lie dead in the streets of our cities, and smaller villages have turned into ghost towns, inhabited only by the deceased corpses of the ponies who once prospered there.\n\nThe vile regime of Hellquill, lead by the disgusting and racist Wingfried von Katerinburg, has treated ponies like dirt before, even cutting defenceless families down with sabers in an effort to destroy the pony population of Hellquill. Now, these acts have grown too big to ignore, and too vile to tolerate.\n\nPonies in Hellquill were apprehended and experimented upon by griffon scientists. It appears that there, the scientists infected the ponies with a terrifying and deadly virus, the purple plague as it is called. Then, they sent hundreds, if not over a thousand of these infected individuals east, into our lands. Anypony that got close to them was almost doomed to die, and this disease has already killed entire countrysides and half the population of certain cities in the River Federation, with the death toll steadily increasing.\n\nWe must take action against these thugs and racists in Hellquill. We can no longer tolerate their actions, nor do we have the choice to look the other way. The Governments of the River Federation have agreed in absolute unison:\n\nWe are going to war. The Griffons will pay!"

Once upon a time, this disease struck fear into the hearts of ponies in the east, and ravaged their homes with its deadly touch. Now, we have the ability to relive that spectacle in front of our own eyes by bringing the virus back to life. By injecting the virus into pony prisoners, and then sending them east, there will surely be a staggering body count for those degenerates."

HLQ_poison_river_war_desc:0 "The Ponies are stronger than we first believed. But that is no matter. In a war like this, a total war of annihilation, all is fair. As such, we shall release an ancient virus that our scientists have managed to revive in their laboratories: The Purple Plague. By injecting this virus into captured ponies and then sending them back to their homes in the east, we can effectively massacre thousands of ponies without even lifting a claw."

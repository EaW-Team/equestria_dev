This decentralization has led to unprecented stability as each town feels like they have a say, but unfortunately, it has also caused political turmoil as major economic and political initiatives cannot be passed through many communities.

### Events ###
adelart.1.t:0 "The 20th Congress Of The Peoples and Peasants"
adelart.1.d:0 ""Come one come all to the great congress of the People! Where all shall be heard and none will ignored! For our nation is built upon these great pledges that all shall be recognized and all shall have a voice!"\n\nThese words opened the national congress for the 20th year in a row this year. Griffons from all about gathered to speak their voice, and everyone had something to say. From simple disputes to national policy, nothing dominated the discussion as much as the issue of how the nation should be run. This debate has been hanging in the air for a while now, and Merlock Wood has been trying to pin down a solution. And it seems now in his 20th year as leader, he will finally force the hand of all the Congress' factions to give him their arguments straight.\n\nFirst, the anarchists, his old compatriots, and brothers. Who believe that the nation should continue as it has, with some reforms and changes, of course. But that their traditions of liberty and freedom will hold them high as they always have. And none can or should take that away from any of the people!\n\nSecond come the Liberals. They talk of the great truths of the republic, and point out the evident and apparent flaws with the current anarchist system. "No one even listens to you anymore!", they proclaim to great disapproval before Merlock raises a claw. They are heard out by the Congress before departing. Having made their point very clear.\n\nLastly come the socialists. Dressed in military regalia or industrial outfits, they speak of the world beyond the woods, and mythical states like "Stalliongrad" who build great Utopias for the workers. And that the nation must come together and centralize under a worker's model of government if all of us are to survive.\n\nThough, as with every congress. The final choice comes to the dear Protector of the nation. What shall Merlock do?"
adelart.1.a:0 "The congress decides to continue the anarchist tradition."
adelart.1.b:0 "The congress decides to reform into a liberal democracy."
adelart.1.c:0 "The congress decides to centralize into a vanguard party."

adelart.2.t:0 "Democracy In The Forests"
adelart.2.d:0 "Merlock Wood sat on the edge of his wooden rocking chair in his forest abode, far far away from the vestiges of government that he must now decide what to do with. He knew his ideal model could not survive. That pure anarchism could not be the way to go forward any longer.\n\nBut what of the rights and liberties that he had fought so long to protect? What of the little griffons who wanted to have their own voice?\n\nWhat will come of their freedom? He sat pondering and thinking over every choice he had to make before he reached a moment of lucidity...\n\nNothing. Nothing would happen to their freedom. He could build a true republic, not like those that were chained by monstrous bureaucratic messes. But one that truly worked for the people. Each citizen for the nation, and the nation for all its citizens."
adelart.2.a:0 "Liberty and democracy!"

adelart.3.t:0 "A Meeting Deep In The Woods"
adelart.3.d:0 "Merlock Wood sat grumbling in a decrepit old house deep in the countryside.\n\n"The Clergy..." he muttered "Why do I have to deal with the Clergy..?"\n\nMerlock was not an impious griffon by any means, he paid heed to the gods as any religious griff did. He just always chafed with the balance of the power of the Clergy in his lands... and now it was coming to a head with his choice to centralize the state into a republic, which was disliked by many members of the Clergy who wished to maintain their right to govern themselves.\n\nAnd on top of that?! He didn't know who he was meeting with. At this point it could be anyone. He trusted them enough for them not to try to assassinate him or anything. But it wouldn't be the first time someone had tried, and failed, to do that. Merlock knew that this issue had to be settled once and for all or his nation would never be able to become the democracy it was meant to be.\n\nA knock? Who will it be?\n\nAs Merlock opened the door, he began to smile. Standing before him was the priest known merely as "Luca vun Lissay".\n\nHe could work with this griff."
adelart.3.a:0 "Nice to see you again, Luca"

adelart.4.t:0 "Rallying The Democrats"
adelart.4.d:0 "The first thing Wood did after his decision for democracy was to begin to call in the various elements he knew he would need to court to build stability for his nation.\n\n First of these were those Liberals who all spoke at the council. He would make them aware of his intentions and try to rally them to assist him in his new efforts to reform the nation.\n\nMessangers ran out across the country from Eagleton and far beyond to gather as many members of the Liberal communities as possible to try to form up a new proto-government, to prepare for the day when elections will be held properly."
adelart.4.a:0 "Democracy will come to Adelart!"

adelart.5.t:0 "Securing The Forest Brothers"
adelart.5.d:0 "When Merlock Wood assumed full leadership over Adelhart, he abdicated leadership of his mercenary group the "Forest Brothers" to a trusted friend nicknamed Lil Bron.\n\nThey remained in a low profile to hide from those forces that would root out their tendency to cause a little thing called "Liberty".\n\nSo Merlock ventured out alone to the deepest parts of the forest to put up their ancient signal. He knew not how they would find him and return to Adelart, but he knew they would. As he took the black powder and threw it over the ancient spruce while carving the sigil of the Brothers into the trunk, he thought about how he wanted to see them all again, and how much he could use their help. To finish the call, he took out the burning twig of a mulberry bush and tossed it onto the tree, producing a deep purple smoke for all of his brothers to see.\n\nA rustling in the trees?! Merlock grabbed his rifle, ready to defend himself one last time, but before he could draw fully, an arrow struck the pouch out of his hand. And a figure emerged from the treeline...\n\n"Hey Merlock." The enormous griffon spoke with a comforting tone, "I knew you would need us back eventually." "
adelart.5.a:0 "Damn it Bron, you almost gave me a heart attack..."

adelart.6.t:0 "Convincing The Anarchists"
adelart.6.d:0 "With the Liberals and his old friends behind him, Merlock now had to embark on his greatest quest of all. Getting the anarchists to be... well less anarchist. They would hold a great convention in the old Sherif's building, a symbolic home of the revolution in Adelart and hammer out the policy. The presence of the Liberal politicians and the great heroes of the revolution really took some pressure off of Merlock's shoulders. As he could simply let them all talk, so he didn't have to speak down to his comrades. He knew what needed to be done. Now they just had to be convinced."
adelart.6.a:0 "See! Representative democracy is good!"

adelart.7.t:0 "The Dawn Of True Democracy"
adelart.7.d:0 "With the Liberals, the Clergy, and the Anarchists all general on board with the whole "normal democracy" thing, we can now finally come together for elections in our nation.\n\nAs soon as Merlock got everyone to Eagleton, the most experienced among them had to explain the concept of a "political party" to some of the delegates in attendance. But once that initial hurdle had been crossed, three parties emerged for the voters of Adelart to pick from. First, the Anarchists and far left Liberals banded together to form the Socialist party, campaigning to keep up with the modern labor standards of the nation and to keep much of the traditional attitudes of decentralized power. They have a strong base of support primarily in the 20 years of the revolutionary history of the nation.\n\nMany of the Liberals have also come together under the Social-Democratic party to put forward a more traditional republican government for the country. They promise more centralization and have support mainly from the new middle class and griffons not so enthused with the revolution twenty years prior.\n\nLastly are the Borean conservatives. A party backed by many religious parties in the nation and promising to put the Gods first in national policy. With that comes many things but the primary support for the party comes from the backing of Luca vun Lissay.\n\nOf course through every party has agreed that Merlock Wood will remain the head of state due to his importance overall.\n\nWho shall win the elections?"
adelart.7.a:0 "The Socialist Coalition!"
adelart.7.b:0 "The Social Democrats!"
adelart.7.c:0 "The Eyrist Conservatives!"

adelart.8.t:0 "A Peaceful Resolution?"
adelart.8.d:0 "Merlock wood sat in his bedroom, tapping at his desk with a pen, he was trying to think of how to go forward from here. A plan of action was needed to usher the Free Territory into the new future of anarchism.\n\nOr perhaps... a plan of inaction? For twenty years he had led the nation by taking action when it was needed, and sitting back and doing near nothing when it wasn't required. What if he could apply this same idea to his situation in the present day? Gentle pushes here and there, but generally allowing the towns to do as they need to fix their own issues.\n\nHuh, nothing never sounded so good."
adelart.8.a:0 "All we need is peace, love, and cooperation, right?"

adelart.9.t:0 "Mobilizing The Militias"
adelart.9.d:0 ""
adelart.9.a:0 "Time to root out these enemies of freedom."

adelart.10.t:0 "On The Matters Of The Sheriff"
adelart.10.d:0 "A specter stalks Adelhard... it is the dark memory of the sheriff's reign over the land, and how he suppressed all the freedoms of the people. And yet many still support his return, mainly based on that crazy concept called "monarchy".\n\nLately our policy of not interfering with many of the communities in the nation has brought to the front some of those who do support this return. And now we must decide our path of action...\n\nWe could easily send in some troops to try to disperse these communities, though this does go against much of what we believe.\n\nAlternatively, we could try to convince them of our benefits by investing in their regions to show our good grace to them as citizens. Though they could turn this aginst us...\n\nOr... we could do nothing. Let the fools burn themselves out, or burn us up...\n\nWhat to choose?"
adelart.10.a:0 "It would be undemocratic to take direct or indirect action."
adelart.10.b:0 "Perhaps some local development will bring them back to the cause?"
adelart.10.c:0 "Are we mad? Send in the troops to these disloyal communities!"

adelart.11.t:0 "An Industrial Grant"
adelart.11.d:0 "We have made our decision to invest in the rebel regions and so see where that gets us with their loyalty. Now the only choice is what we should do. A simple thing would be to build more roads to carry ideas and, if needed, troops to the region, which will connect them to Adelart as a whole. Though, many of the areas loyal to the Sheriff are religious communities, if we were to build a new temple, they might be easily swayed to our side."
adelart.11.a:0 "Build a couple of new roads."
adelart.11.b:0 "Build a new church to the three Gods."

adelart.12.t:0 "Pro-Greifwald Activity Increases"
adelart.12.d:0 "Mixed reports are coming in... but it seems our efforts have backfired. Activities in support of the sheriff's return have increased in our nation. We must be careful of how we proceed from this point onwards..."
adelart.12.a:0 "Oops."

adelart.13.t:0 "Making Our Move"
adelart.13.d:0 "The choice has been made that we shall send in armed forces to remove the supporters of the sheriff from their communities and restore order. Now we must decide how we go about this. An easy and straightforward way to go through with the plan would be to hire a passing group of mercenaries to get the dirty work done for us, and to ensure none of our citizens fall in the effort. The downside being well... they are mercenaries. The alternative is our own citizen soldiers, though deaths in this operation could cause great pain to our prestige."
adelart.13.a:0 "Hire a cheap mercenary band to root them out."
adelart.13.b:0 "Raise a popular militia brigade to bring them to justice."

adelart.14.t:0 "Our Mercenaries Defect!"
adelart.14.d:0 "Terrible news! It appears the Sheriff himself has been found... but in the worst way. It seems he had a large reserve of cash lying around and has bribed our mercenaries to serve with him instead of taking down his rebellious communities. They are now emboldened against our government. We must be cautious..."
adelart.14.a:0 "Why did we trust them??!!"

adelart.15.t:0 "Decrease In Pro-Sheriff Activity"
adelart.15.d:0 "Our efforts have borne fruit. It appears efforts to support the sheriff have taken a steep decline recently. We may now sleep a bit safer.\n\nAnd maybe without guns under our pillows."
adelart.15.a:0 "Excellent."

adelart.16.t:0 "The Issue Of Decentralization"
adelart.16.d:0 "With our non-involvement policy we must now decide to what degree that shall go. We already have prolific decentralization throughout our nation, and only some of the most far flung, miniscule, and unimportant communities do not yet have a full role in teh coices of the nation. We could easily rectify this, but do we really want to spread our control that thin? We could easily keep the current system as well. Which would keep our citizens content."
adelart.16.a:0 "Some townships STILL don't have a voice!"
adelart.16.b:0 "I think our current level is just fine..."

adelart.17.t:0 "Ending Church Autonomy"
adelart.17.d:0 "The church, while an essential part of our nation, hold too much power in our society. Powerful figures are able to rally people to violence that could be directed against our government at any time. And so the conclusion is brought we must revoke the majority of church lands and bring them in line with the rest of the nation. Though this is bound to cause hostility on their part. A simpler alternative is to simply stop funding themselves and setting them out to survive on their own. Which, while not granting us the full benefits of their wealth; would keep them at least placated."
adelart.17.a:0 "Seize their land and slash their autonomy!"
adelart.17.b:0 "Only stop giving the church reperations."

adelart.18.t:0 "The Sheriff Strikes"
adelart.18.d:0 ""
adelart.18.a:0 "Order, justice, and stability for Adelart."

adelart.19.t:0 "A Bright Day in Adelart"
adelart.19.d:0 "The day was peaceful, and the forest birds sang as the sun rose on order's victory. The Sherif of Adelart sat content. His job had been done, and he had restored order to this rouge province of his. Now he shall return it to the Count one way or another, and all shall be well.\n\nA Knock? Who could it be this early in the morning?\n\nA nervous page sat wriggling in his leather boots outside the door, "Sir, sir sheriff?" he seemed squeamish as he spoke the frantic words. "There is uhh... a priest here to see you."\n\n"Ah yes! The servants of the gods are here to thank me for removing that dirty criminal from their lands!" the Sheriff spoke with bravado, he was happy, he had always been faithful to Boreas above, and that loyalty was finally coming back to repay him.\n\nHe pushed past the page and moved along, grabbing his wide-brimmed hat along the way. Though as he neared the door, he began to hear an ominous chanting from outside... what could that be? As he exited the building that served as his headquarters, he bore witness to a truly shocking thing.\n\nTens and tens of griffons in the robes of peasants lined up with various relics in their hands, chanting in unison prayers and hymns unknown to the prelates in Griffenheim, or the Sheriff's ears. But most of all, what shocked the usually steely griffon, where he met his match, was the behemoth of steel that sat in the middle of the field. And stepping to the top, a griffon dressed in the cloth of a peasant man holding an ancient reliquary.\n\n"Godless demon of Adelart! You defile the people's right and bend before the corrupters of the gods! You rob us of our belief, and so we rob you of your power! The true believers shall have a home once more! For Boreas who guides us! Eyr who feeds us, and Arcturus who sends you to damnation!"\n\nEyr has come to Adelart."

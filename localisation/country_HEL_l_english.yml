HEL_reassure_the_anarchists:0 "Convince The Anarchists"
HEL_reassure_the_anarchists_desc:0 "The anarchists have always been the ones most opposed to any central reform. If we can show them that democracy gives them a chance to express their views, maybe they can get on our side?"

HEL_dispersed_air_doctrine_desc:0 "There is no point in investing in airfields or airplanes if we do not know how to use them. Thus with airfields built and the first Adelart planes in production, we have to establish an Adelartian aerial doctrine."

HEL_integrate_the_militias:0 "Absorb The Militias"
HEL_integrate_the_militias_desc:0 "While we wish our army to remain decentralized we must ensure that all the militias of Adelart can still remain under the army's general control.

HEL_the_sisters_of_eyr_desc:0 "The sisters of Eyr are an... eccentric group. Parading around Adelart in their iron behemoths they enforce the will of the gods on the land. We should make an effort to try to associate them with our military and use their divine strength."

HEL_the_jade_company_desc:0 "The Jade company are a group of republican militias with no centralized command, just a common name, and cause.

HEL_a_direct_democracy:0 "A Decentralized, Direct, Democracy!"
HEL_a_direct_democracy_desc:0 "While there are many ways of governance which allegedly represent the interests of the population, only a decentralized and direct democracy truly represents the interests of the populace, thus it is the only way of governance worth to pursue."

HEL_switzerland:0 "The Federal Council Of Adelart"
HEL_switzerland_desc:0 "While direct democracy does provide our populace the most fair and equal way of participating in the governance of the state, certain examples of direct democracy across Griffonia have shown the problems such a system causes it's relied upon too much.

HEL_gun_rights:0 "A Gun For Every Griffon"
HEL_gun_rights_desc:0 "20 years ago the griffons of Adelart declared independence from the Greifwald tyrants in a popular uprising.

HEL_support_the_old_believers_desc:0 "The majority of the population of Adelart is comprised of highly religious griffons.

HEL_decentralized_education:0 "Autonomous Education System"
HEL_decentralized_education_desc:0 "For a democratic, especially directly democratic, system to work, the populace needs to be knowledgeable enough to realize what is best for them.

HEL_decentralized_education_anarchist:0 "Decentralize Education"
HEL_decentralized_education_anarchist_desc:0 "For a democratic, especially directly democratic, system to work, the populace needs to be knowledgeable enough to realize what is best for them.

#Democratic Centralization Path

HEL_a_centralized_democracy:0 "End Decentralization"
HEL_a_centralized_democracy_desc:0 "Direct deomcracy worked twenty years ago, but it has shown its constraints over the last two decades. We must consolidate the will of the people into a federal entity! Checks and balances will be put in place, but our government must be able to act faster than a referendum."

HEL_a_powerful_executive:0 "No Longer Just A Figurehead"
HEL_a_powerful_executive_desc:0 "The office of the Speaker has never been more then a way to honor our country's father in Merlock Wood.

HEL_polizei:0 "De Geheimdéngscht"
HEL_polizei_desc:0 "Our citizens deserve the right to a local security force, but across our territories we need a fair entity to enforce our nation's laws that is not limited by county lines.

HEL_a_real_university_desc:0 "With greater control of all our government's assets, we are able to put forward generous subsidies to attract academics to Adelart.

HEL_centralize_the_church:0 "Religious Centralization"
HEL_centralize_the_church_desc:0 "There are many different congregations of Eyr in our lands. It is the idea of a madgriffon to simply let each have their own special permissions within Adelart. With that, we will classify the faiths into the largest demoninations. This is only for bureaucratic purposes, of course."


#Democratic Eyrist-Conservative Path

HEL_agrarianism_focus:0 "Rural Traditionalism"
HEL_agrarianism_focus_desc:0 "The majority of our population may reside in urban centers, but the true heart of Adelart is found outside of the cities. We must appeal to these rural masses for support. By changing the way that votes are weighed by county we can grant them a louder voice in government."

HEL_eyrite_values:0 "Temperance, Diligence, Community"
HEL_eyrite_values_desc:0 "Liquor, drugs, and other social vices will not be tolerated in our new Adelart. In an effort to curb poverty, our government shall make initiatives to grant local citizen councils the power to ensure their own piety and foster community consciousness in our nation."

HEL_encourage_large_families:0 "Pass The Adelartian Families Act"
HEL_encourage_large_families_desc:0 "It is only in recent years that Adelart has passed a million griffons in its territory. As our standard of living inscreases, our birthrate goes down. Therefore, we must make it appealing and beneficial to have a large family by offering subsidies and tax cuts."

HEL_eyrian_charity:0 "The Charity Of Eyr"
HEL_eyrian_charity_desc:0 "We cannot afford to forget our most destitute in these trying times. The church shall use its vast influence in Adelart to provide charity to those in need, all of which will be subsidized and supported by the current administration."

HEL_subsidize_the_farms:0 "Peasants Into Farmers"
HEL_subsidize_the_farms_desc:0 "It is time that we return to our roots, quite literally.

We must modernize our farms and give our farmers the tools to grow past their peasant pastures."

HEL_social_funds:0 "A Social Fund"
HEL_social_funds_desc:0 "The church's charity can only go so far. A Social Fund must be set up for our poorer communities that are suffering in this time of change. Well-timed and modest grants will empower local entities to solve their own problems effectively at the ground level."

HEL_a_better_figurehead:0 "Recall Merlock Wood"
HEL_a_better_figurehead_desc:0 "Merlock Wood is a hero to our people, despite his connections to the socialists. While we cannot persecute him for his political escapades, we can recall him from service and grant him a hero's retirement; effectively removing him from any real power."

HEL_adelart_above_everything_eyr_above_everyone:0 "The Adelartian Path To Democracy"
HEL_adelart_above_everything_eyr_above_everyone_desc:0 "Democracy is the best and yet the worst form of government.

#Democratic Social Democratic Path#

HEL_a_secular_adelart:0 "A Secular Adelart"
HEL_a_secular_adelart_desc:0 "Faith empowers, but we cannot let faith have power. The corruption of the church when it meddles with government is clear, but we will protect everyone's right to worship. However, there will be a clear separation between church and state."

HEL_nurture_new_business:0 "Nurture New Businesses"
HEL_nurture_new_business_desc:0 "A free market of a free territory must be regulated, however this means we also have a responsebility to support new business in our lands. By offering grants to key industries, we can support the new businesses that arises around them."

HEL_welfare_for_the_people:0 "Welfare For The Common Griffon"
HEL_welfare_for_the_people_desc:0 "The common griffon is entitled to security, prosperity, and the pursuit of happiness. While we cannot gurantee the last, we can gurantee the first two with a well-rounded welfare program accesible to any citizen that needs it."

HEL_revolutionary_spirit:0 "Republican Internationalism"
HEL_revolutionary_spirit_desc:0 "The Aquileian refugees that came to our territories following their first revolution's failure have shown us that the Republican cause is our cause wherever it is found! It must be made clear that any republic on any continent is our friend!"

HEL_the_aquilean_model:0 "The Aquileian Model"
HEL_the_aquilean_model_desc:0 "As we cement our nation's government, we can stand on the shoulders of giants! Although there are many great republics around the world, we will look South to our cultural neighbors in Aquileia for inspiration!"

HEL_the_parliamentary_system:0 "Adopt The Assemblée Nationale"
HEL_the_parliamentary_system_desc:0 "We will expand our legislature to mimic the national assembly of the Aquileian model, our deputies will ensure that the voice of their constituents are heard in the matters of the nation!"

HEL_real_healthcare:0 "Real Healthcare"
HEL_real_healthcare_desc:0 "Prayers and apothecaries might cure colds or magical ailments, but they do not treat diseases, remove tumors, or care for trauma patients. We must afford everyone in our country the right to effective healthcare with real hospitals and real doctors!"

HEL_a_free_and_modern_adelart:0 "Not A Free Territory, But A Republic"
HEL_a_free_and_modern_adelart_desc:0 "Our reforms are already bearing fruit, the future of Adelart is not one of tyranny or anarchy. We look upon her now with solemn pride, for she is a nation that protects, educates, and nutures its people. We are not a territory, a mob of forest bandits with ideals; but a republic of free griffons."

### Democratic Commie Path ### (Isn't that kind of an oxymoron? not in adelart)

HEL_encourage_communal_lifestyles:0 "A Communal Society"
HEL_encourage_communal_lifestyles_desc:0 "There are many small towns and villages that are scattered across the forests of Adelart. Many of them are suffer from grave issues which our government is simply unable to help them with due to the libertarian nature of our country. Thus we will enable these towns to administer self-governance through a communal system at a local level."

HEL_distance_from_extremism:0 "Distance From The Extremists"
HEL_distance_from_extremism_desc:0 "While Adelart has been accused of being radicals and lunatics by many foreigners, these claims are mostly absurd and laughable. However, even some in our own country correctly remind us there are more extreme elements among us. In order to ensure the safety and longevity of our nation, we must root them out."

HEL_eyrian_socialism:0 "Eyrian Socialism"
HEL_eyrian_socialism_desc:0 "The griffons of Adelart, be they from the rural or the urban environment, are highly religious. To them there is no animosity to the divine or its speakers, unlike many other socialist philosophies. Our ways are simply not based on the material realm, but inspired by that which is divine - faith in the Goddess Eyr."

HEL_left_nationalism:0 "Left Nationalism"
HEL_left_nationalism_desc:0 "Adelart is and will hopefully always will be a realm of socialist workers and farmers. However, differently from most socialist workers, the griffons of Adelart do not see themselves as part of some international group. Rather they choose to still identify with the Adelartian culture. This has been our strength in previous struggles and hopefully will be our strength in future ones."

HEL_socialism_with_adelartian_characteristics:0 "The Collectives And Councils"
HEL_socialism_with_adelartian_characteristics_desc:0 "While we move to establish more traditional collectives within Adelart, we cannot forget the characteristics of our people. Although these collectives will be formed from many different farms, we shall allow each of the former property owners to be part of a council that administers the collective for the sake of posterity."

HEL_wealth_for_the_workers:0 "Wealth For The Workers"
HEL_wealth_for_the_workers_desc:0 "While the workers of Adelart are free from Greifwaldian oppression, many of them still suffer from poverty and the problems that it causes. While the central leadership of Adelart does not have much to spare, we can and will use those resources to help these poor griffs."

HEL_the_first_unions:0 "The First Unions"
HEL_the_first_unions_desc:0 "Adelart has never been an industrialized region. And without industry there was never a need for unions among the inhabitants of Adelart before the revolution. We will outsource help to establish worker unions based on the rural tradition of the old believers to further expand our ideas of within our growing urban centers."

HEL_hoist_the_green_and_red:0 "Déi Gréng a Rout"
HEL_hoist_the_green_and_red_desc:0 "Hoist the red and green, brothers and sisters! Adelart is the dream of the rural proletariat, that these once oppressed pesants now lead a truly democratic and communist nation! Let all of Griffonia know the success of our great experiment, for we are first in this new path!"

### Democratic Capitalist Path "Democratic" ###

HEL_an_end_to_wood:0 "No More Bandits"
HEL_an_end_to_wood_desc:0 "Merlock Wood and his socialist thugs have plauged our country for twenty years. We once thought him as a liberator, but now we see the danger. If we allow him and his ideology to persist we will fall into ruin. For the good of Adelart and our interests, Merlock Wood will be neutralized."

HEL_abolish_the_congress:0 "No More Congresses"
HEL_abolish_the_congress_desc:0 "The congresses were designed to give the people a voice, but they are a shrill chorus ruled by a mob mentality. The reperensentatives the people choose are fickle, dependent on pleasing those who elected them. They are incapable of seeing the bigger picture for our country."

HEL_a_new_chamber:0 "A New Chamber"
HEL_a_new_chamber_desc:0 "We will salvage the useful assets from the congresses, but more importantly we shall impose a new chamber. Some might call it an oligrachy, but by limiting the number of representatives and granting them greater power we can create a more unified front to envision our future."

HEL_remove_old_believer_broadcasts:0 "Censor The Old Believers"
HEL_remove_old_believer_broadcasts_desc:0 "Luca vun Lissay and their Old Believers would be useful allies in the fight against socialist ideology, but their penchant for needless charity stirs the pot. We cannot allow the church to hold a great deal of influence among the common people. We will censor their broadcasts or silence them entirely."

HEL_a_haven_for_business:0 "A Haven For Business"
HEL_a_haven_for_business_desc:0 "Our opponents that used to sit on the left side of the aisle painted Adelart as a haven for the working griffon, but that is not profitable. What can be done is the lowering of corporate taxes and deregulation of labor laws. Through these reforms we shall make Adelart a capitalist's dream!"

HEL_friends_in_flowena:0 "Further Ties With Flowena"
HEL_friends_in_flowena_desc:0 "The banks of Flowena are deep and their coffers are full. Because our regions are close with one another, it is only a logical step to have our business interests close with them as well. With a few generous trade agreements and concessions, we can get a claw in the door where we have not before."

HEL_sell_off_the_collectives:0 "Sell Off The Collectives"
HEL_sell_off_the_collectives_desc:0 "The one useful thing that the communists did for Adelrat was consolidating all of the land into collectives for us. Now that we are in control, we can sell these collectives back to their original owners or their competition with a healthy profit."

HEL_a_new_banking_capital:0 "Bring Adelart Into The World"
HEL_a_new_banking_capital_desc:0 "Through careful economic and political manipulation, we have created a captalistic paradise that rivals our friends in Flowena and outshines even the oligarchs of the Skyfall Federation. For only in Adelart are all griffons equal under the idol!"

### Capitalist Industry Tree ###

HEL_capitalism_in_adelart:0 "The New Economy"
HEL_capitalism_in_adelart_desc:0 "We are a backwater cesspool of industry, but we have the capability for so much more. We will have to realize our potential for industrial expansion and growth, which means that we have to embrace the values of a free market head on with open arms."

HEL_store_their_gold:0 "Storing Griffonia's Gold"
HEL_store_their_gold_desc:0 "To say that there is conflict brewing on the continent is an understatement of the century. It does not take a seer to understand that even in traditional banking cities there is unrest, so we will offer a non-traditional option to investors. The banks of Adelart will offer fair premiums and high interests with the promise of stability and security."

HEL_send_out_the_invitations:0 "Invite The Investors"
HEL_send_out_the_invitations_desc:0 "Jacob De Conard's contacts in Flowena will allow us to reach potential investors that might be wary of the banking city's...reputation. A few promises here about access to Lissay's oilfields, a few promises there about having some institutions named in their honor, and a 'no-questions-asked' policy about the origin of the money should attract many wealthy griffons."

HEL_industrialize_the_sites:0 "Industrialize The Sites"
HEL_industrialize_the_sites_desc:0 "What few exisiting industrial sites we have need to be modernized before we attempt expanding upon them. We will have to arrange several deals in order to secure new machines, trucks, and a more skilled labor pool. This might mean we have to cut a deal or two with the unions, but at the heart of capitalism is compromise."

HEL_the_great_conard_bank:0 "The Grand Bank Of Conard"
HEL_the_great_conard_bank_desc:0 "De Conrad's efforts in attracting investors has not gone unnoticed, especially by him. It is only fair that the most prestigious of our new banking institutions bear the name of the griffon that built it from the ground up afterall, by the sweat on his brow and the ungodly ammount of idols in his pocket."

HEL_chop_down_the_forests:0 "Chop Down The Forests"
HEL_chop_down_the_forests_desc:0 "In an age of steel, iron, and oil there is often the griffon who forgets the importance of the humble tree. We will need the additional timber for new houses, papermills, and other industries that require vast quantities of wood. In addition, clearing out some of the forests will make room for new factories and infrastructure."

HEL_research_stuff:0 "End Iliteracy"
HEL_research_stuff_desc:0 "The ability to read should not be limited to the wealthy or the clergy as if we were under Grover II! The printing press has been around for centuries, we can afford to subsidize some programs to improve the literacy rate among our population. A smarter work force will generate smarter ideas. It is best to work smarter, not harder."

HEL_literacy_for_all:0 "Expand The Schools"
HEL_literacy_for_all_desc:0 "As we expand industry we will also need an educated population to meet the positions that will inevitably open up overtime. Engineers to craft new machines, scientists to develop new medicine, and bankers to figure out how to sell it all. It is with this foresight that we further invest in our public education, so that the best and brightest can turn a profit in the future."

HEL_into_the_factories:0 "Into The Factories"
HEL_into_the_factories_desc:0 "Not every griffon is destinited to be a soldier, a farmer, or a priest. With the expansion of factories in urban areas, we will start a campaign to bring farmers and their families into the cities to work at these industrial sites. By subsidizing housing and coordinating with industry leaders, we will make it very appealing to relocate."

HEL_tax_breaks_for_industry:0 "Tax Breaks For Industry"
HEL_tax_breaks_for_industry_desc:0 "As we try to stimulate rapid economic growth and expansion, temporary tax breaks with a ten year lifespan shall encourage businesses to invest and invest quickly to reap the most profit. This should stimulate industry for the next decade and sustain our growth."

HEL_new_taxes:0 "Who Should Pay For It?"
HEL_new_taxes_desc:0 "A five percent income tax on our poorest griffon and our richest griffon is widely different a sum of idols. Squeezing every idol out of our poor makes little sense, a comprehensive tax reform that shifts based upon annual income shall be a fair way forward. There might be some grumbling from our wealthiest citizens, but a fair tax is better than another socialist revolt."

HEL_bring_adelart_into_the_modern_age:0 "Backwater No Longer"
HEL_bring_adelart_into_the_modern_age_desc:0 "One only has to look out a window to see the fruits of our labors. Cars roll down paved roads and street lights cut through the darkness. The hum of industry is heard all hours of the day, the oil fields of Lissay flow with black gold, and the banks are overflowing with Idols. We have entered into the modern age with the means to enjoy it."

adelart.1.t:0 "The 20th Congress Of Peoples and Peasants"
adelart.1.d:0 ""Come one come all to the great congress of the People! Where all shall be heard and none will ignored! For our nation is built upon these great pledges that all shall be recognized and all shall have a voice!"\n\nThese words opened the national congress for the 20th year in a row this year. Griffons from all about gathered to speak their voice, and everyone had something to say. From simple disputes to national policy, nothing dominated the discussion as much as the issue of how the nation should be run. This debate has been hanging in the air for a while now, and Merlock Wood has been trying to pin down a solution. And it seems now in his 20th year as leader, he will finally force the hand of all the Congress' factions to give him their arguments straight.\n\nFirst, the anarchists, his old compatriots, and brothers. Who believe that the nation should continue as it has, with some reforms and changes, of course. But that their traditions of liberty and freedom will hold them high as they always have. And none can or should take that away from any of the people!\n\nSecond come the Liberals. They talk of the great truths of the republic, and point out the evident and apparent flaws with the current anarchist system. "No one even listens to you anymore!", they proclaim to great disapproval before Merlock raises a claw. They are heard out by the Congress before departing. Having made their point very clear.\n\nLastly come the socialists. Dressed in military regalia or industrial outfits, they speak of the world beyond the woods, and mythical states like "Stalliongrad" who build great Utopias for the workers. And that the nation must come together and centralize under a worker's model of government if all of us are to survive.\n\nThough, as with every congress. The final choice comes to the dear Protector of the nation. What shall Merlock do?"

He knew his ideal model could not survive. That pure anarchism could not be the way to go forward any longer.\n\nBut what of the rights and liberties that he had fought so long to protect? What of the little griffons who wanted to have their own voice?\n\nWhat will come of their freedom? He sat pondering and thinking over every choice he had to make before he reached a moment of lucidity...\n\nNothing. Nothing would happen to their freedom. He could build a true republic, not like those that were chained by monstrous bureaucratic messes. But one that truly worked for the people. Each citizen for the nation, and the nation for all its citizens."
adelart.2.a:0 "Liberty and democracy!"

adelart.3.t:0 "A Meeting Deep In The Woods"
adelart.3.d:0 "Merlock Wood sat grumbling in a decrepit old house deep in the countryside.\n\n"The Clergy..." he muttered "Why do I have to deal with the Clergy..?"\n\nMerlock was not an impious griffon by any means, he paid heed to the gods as any religious griff did. He just always chafed with the balance of the power of the Clergy in his lands... and now it was coming to a head with his choice to centralize the state into a republic, which was disliked by many members of the Clergy who wished to maintain their right to govern themselves.\n\nAnd on top of that?! He didn't know who he was meeting with. At this point it could be anyone. He trusted them enough for them not to try to assassinate him or anything. But it wouldn't be the first time someone had tried, and failed, to do that. Merlock knew that this issue had to be settled once and for all or his nation would never be able to become the democracy it was meant to be.\n\nA knock? Who will it be?\n\nAs Merlock opened the door, he began to smile. Standing before him was the priest known merely as "Luca vun Lissay".\n\nHe could work with this griff."

adelart.4.d:0 "The first thing Wood did after his decision for democracy was to begin to call in the various elements he knew he would need to court to build stability for his nation.\n\n First of these were those Liberals who all spoke at the council. He would make them aware of his intentions and try to rally them to assist him in his new efforts to reform the nation.\n\nMessangers ran out across the country from Eagleton and far beyond to gather as many members of the Liberal communities as possible to try to form up a new proto-government, to prepare for the day when elections will be held properly."
adelart.4.a:0 "Democracy will come to Adelart!"

adelart.5.t:0 "Securing The Forest Brothers"
adelart.5.d:0 "When Merlock Wood assumed full leadership over Adelhart, he abdicated leadership of his mercenary group the "Forest Brothers" to a trusted friend nicknamed Lil Bron.\n\nThey remained in a low profile to hide from those forces that would root out their tendency to cause a little thing called "Liberty".\n\nSo Merlock ventured out alone to the deepest parts of the forest to put up their ancient signal. He knew not how they would find him and return to Adelart, but he knew they would. As he took the black powder and threw it over the ancient spruce while carving the sigil of the Brothers into the trunk, he thought about how he wanted to see them all again, and how much he could use their help. To finish the call, he took out the burning twig of a mulberry bush and tossed it onto the tree, producing a deep purple smoke for all of his brothers to see.\n\nA rustling in the trees?! Merlock grabbed his rifle, ready to defend himself one last time, but before he could draw fully, an arrow struck the pouch out of his hand. And a figure emerged from the treeline...\n\n"Hey Merlock." The enormous griffon spoke with a comforting tone, "I knew you would need us back eventually." "
adelart.5.a:0 "Damn it Bron, you almost gave me a heart attack..."

adelart.6.t:0 "Convincing The Anarchists"
adelart.6.d:0 "With the Liberals and his old friends behind him, Merlock now had to embark on his greatest quest of all. Getting the anarchists to be... well less anarchist. They would hold a great convention in the old Sherif's building, a symbolic home of the revolution in Adelart and hammer out the policy. The presence of the Liberal politicians and the great heroes of the revolution really took some pressure off of Merlock's shoulders. As he could simply let them all talk, so he didn't have to speak down to his comrades. He knew what needed to be done. Now they just had to be convinced."

adelart.7.d:0 "With the Liberals, the Clergy, and the Anarchists all general on board with the whole "normal democracy" thing, we can now finally come together for elections in our nation.\n\nAs soon as Merlock got everyone to Eagleton, the most experienced among them had to explain the concept of a "political party" to some of the delegates in attendance. But once that initial hurdle had been crossed, three parties emerged for the voters of Adelart to pick from. First, the Anarchists and far left Liberals banded together to form the Socialist party, campaigning to keep up with the modern labor standards of the nation and to keep much of the traditional attitudes of decentralized power. They have a strong base of support primarily in the 20 years of the revolutionary history of the nation.\n\nMany of the Liberals have also come together under the Social-Democratic party to put forward a more traditional republican government for the country. They promise more centralization and have support mainly from the new middle class and griffons not so enthused with the revolution twenty years prior.\n\nLastly are the Borean conservatives. A party backed by many religious parties in the nation and promising to put the Gods first in national policy. With that comes many things but the primary support for the party comes from the backing of Luca vun Lissay.\n\nOf course through every party has agreed that Merlock Wood will remain the head of state due to his importance overall.\n\nWho shall win the elections?"

A plan of action was needed to usher the Free Territory into the new future of anarchism.\n\nOr perhaps... a plan of inaction? For twenty years he had led the nation by taking action when it was needed, and sitting back and doing near nothing when it wasn't required. What if he could apply this same idea to his situation in the present day? Gentle pushes here and there, but generally allowing the towns to do as they need to fix their own issues.\n\nHuh, nothing never sounded so good."

And yet many still support his return, mainly based on that crazy concept called "monarchy".\n\nLately our policy of not interfering with many of the communities in the nation has brought to the front some of those who do support this return. And now we must decide our path of action...\n\nWe could easily send in some troops to try to disperse these communities, though this does go against much of what we believe.\n\nAlternatively, we could try to convince them of our benefits by investing in their regions to show our good grace to them as citizens. Though they could turn this aginst us...\n\nOr... we could do nothing. Let the fools burn themselves out, or burn us up...\n\nWhat to choose?"

An easy and straightforward way to go through with the plan would be to hire a passing group of mercenaries to get the dirty work done for us, and to ensure none of our citizens fall in the effort. The downside being well... they are mercenaries. The alternative is our own citizen soldiers, though deaths in this operation could cause great pain to our prestige."

We already have prolific decentralization throughout our nation, and only some of the most far flung, miniscule, and unimportant communities do not yet have a full role in teh coices of the nation. We could easily rectify this, but do we really want to spread our control that thin? We could easily keep the current system as well. Which would keep our citizens content."

adelart.19.d:0 "The day was peaceful, and the forest birds sang as the sun rose on the law's victory. The Sherif of Adelart sat content. Thumbing through some paperwork, he saw reports of Woodests all across the land being culled by this restoration. The violent tendencies of revolutionaries would be wiped away, and peace would come to the forests. Now began the work of administration, and all shall return to as it was before that Anarchist Wood ever tainted this land.\n\nThen, a knock came upon the Sheriff's door. Putting down his quill and parchment, Nottemagne opened the door. A nervous page sat waiting for him outside the door, "Sherif, sir, you have a priest here to see you." he seemed squeamish as he spoke the frantic words. "But it's not just that..."\n\nNottemagne laughed and pushed the page to the side, "Ah, yes! The servants of the gods are here to thank me for removing that dirty criminal from their lands!" the Sheriff spoke with bravado, "And I am sure whatever surprise they have waiting for me will surely be a great one!" The Sherif was happy. He had always been faithful to Boreas above, removing the godless communists and doing his service to the rightful prelate of Griefwald. Now all his hard work was coming back to repay him.\n\nMoving down the hallways of his office in Eagleton, grabbing his wide-brimmed hat along the way, he noticed most of the usual staff did not seem to be there. It must be Saturday he presumed, and moved along. Though as he neared the door, he began to hear an ominous chanting from outside, a rhythmic droning that rattled his skull and shook his mind. Pushing through, he exited the building and suddenly stopped, digging his talons into the floor, he tried to stammer out words but could not. In front of him stood rows and rows of griffons in the robes of peasants and religious orders lined up with various relics and tomes in their hands, chanting in unison prayers and hymns unknown to the Archons in Griffenheim, or the Sheriff's ears. But most frightening of all, what shocked the usually steely griffon the most, where he met his match, was the behemoth of steel that sat in the middle of the field. And stepping to the top, a griffon dressed in the cloth of a peasant man holding an ancient reliquary.\n\n"Godless demon of Adelart! You defile the people's right and bend before the corrupters of the gods! You rob us of our belief, and so we rob you of your power and your life! The true believers shall have a home once more in these sacred forests! For Boreas, who leads us, Eyr, who feeds us, and Arcturus, who sends you to damnation!"\n\nWith this, the Sherif felt a sharpness on his back. Turning around, he saw Sister Selena, leader of the sisters of Eyr, with a blade on the back of his neck. "By the will of the gods, you are dethroned Sherif."\n\n"Because Eyr has come to Adelart.""

adelart.29.d:0 "While Merlook Wood and his comrades strive to maintain a decentralized system of governance where every griffon can truly decide how to live in this socialist society by themselves, not all prominent, allegedly, socialist ideologues and local figures within the borders of Adelart maintain the same mentality. These so called “Vanguardists” cast a shadow across the country, trying to convince the workers and farmers of Adelart that a strong socialist state is needed to create a true utopia of the lower classes. These extremist madmen desire to turn Adelart into but another Stalliongrad or Prywhen, a shackled state, even if robed in red.\n\nWhile these agitators and extremists were initially willing to seek a compromise with more anarchist and libertarian elements within the movement which would lead to the independence of Adelart and has now coalesced into the socialist coalition, and even helped with the original rebellion against the tyrant sheriff and his Greifwaldian overlords, this has changed. While some claim that the actions of these vanguardists, even if somewhat widespread, wouldn’t have any effect on the country and it’s inhabitants. After all they didn’t have the effect in the last few decades, so what would change now? However, Merlook Wood is unwilling to just allow this to continue, especially now that these extremists are far more prominent and even willing to criticize the current system as “betrayal of the socialist ideal” and the ruling coalition.\n\nThus, even with heavy heart, the Woodists drove the statist extremists out of any and all leadership positions, and even in some cases, pushed them out beyond the borders of Adelart with force of arms."

adelart.30.t:0 "The Principle of Left Nationalism"
adelart.30.d:0 "While many other socialist thinkers and leaders believed and promoted the idea that the working class does not have a nation. They claimed that nations are but arbitrary constructs, yet another symptom of the eternal conflict between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. However, the hero of the Adelartian revolution and war of independence, Merlock Wood, does not hold the same opinion. After all socialism was an Equestrian ideology in origin, created in a realm where most citizens perceived themselves as part of a whole, a single realm forged millenniums ago. Griffonia and the kingdoms and empires that rose were forged through violence, subjugation and even in many cases destruction of languages and cultures.\n\nWith such historical circumstances it would seem truly absurd for griffon socialists to desire to abandon their culture, language and in many cases faith. After all in Griffonia, it’s the bourgeoisie that seek such destruction, while the proletariat, the farmers and workers, desire to maintain these ties. Thus it could be argued, and Merlock Wood and his allies do, that in the context of Griffonia, nationalism isn’t a symbol of radical right, rather it can also be the symbol of the workers liberation. After all it was this cultural association, together with the old believer faith that, based on which the workers of Adelart were so ready to mobilize against the oppressors from Greifwald.\n\nFurthermore, while most socialists are heavily utopian in their beliefs and think that some sort of hypothetical continental or even world socialist republic would be equal in fair to all, we are sceptical of such outcomes. After all, without any differentiation or inner borders, does that not mean that even in a socialist state, richer and more developed regions would simply dominate the lesser ones?"

Although he was succeeded by two daughters, none took up his family name, and soon after his death, his home was sold off to the local peasant assembly to become cooperative housing for the small town's urban residents. His funeral was attended only by his closest friends and government minister Harriet Roberts, who had taken an interest in Adelart's heirs, even at one point asking Wood to re-instate the Sweetsingers for nationalistic and politcial gain.\n\nWith Leonald's death, whatever remained of centuries-old monarchist groups in Adelart has dissapated, and vanguardists have taken the event to be a sign that monarchists will soon serve the sheriff and Greifwaldian exile groups, ordering Wood to take action and drive the sheriff's supporters from Adelart.\n\nAlthough Leonald's death was sadly politicized by the Congress of People and Peasants, it was a bitter end for a dynasty that had longed to rule Adelart again for hundreds of years. Now, the Sweetsingers will be ruling no county, and the dynasty that went from counts to peasants has finally ended."

###LEADERS###
jacob_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 13th of April, 974 in Conard\n\n§YBiography§!: Jacob de Conard was 6 when the Adelartian Revolution broke out, and the bonds that tied them to the ancient monarchy of Greifwald were forever broken. But to think that Jacob ever stayed in Adelart with its new collectivist government in power would be wildly incorrect. His family, mostly capitalists loyal to the County of Greifwald, moved to Flowena, at that point suffering from its own declaration of independence from Pomovarra. De Conard, a quick learner and ruthless capitalist, soon rose through the ranks of Flowena's school system, graduating with a degree in economics.\n\nAfter his brief stint in Flowena, De Conard soon moved to Conard, in Adelart, his old home, where he campaigned for the end of the "peasant's government" of Merlock Wood and the fall of "tyrannical collectivism". Soon, De Conard helped to found the Conard Academy Of Arts And Sciences, and took a brief job as a designer for the Adelartian army, creating budget versions of Imperial tanks, but none of his jobs truly spoke to him.\n\n.In 1003, blessed with a unique opportunity, De Conard began talks with the Flowenan government about a possible takeover in Adelart - to ensure that the vast oil reserves of the Lissay were entrusted to loyal and hard-working griffons. While Flowena pulled the strings behind Adelart's new democratic reforms, unbeknownst to even the government, De Conard watched and waited until his time to strike - and now, Adelart is his.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Kessel"
merlock_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 11th of May, 959 in Bergelun\n\n§YBiography§!: Merlock Wood is called many things. Traitor, bandit, murderer, hero, protector - but none can deny that he is a revolutionary above all. Wood started his revolutionary career as a little-known partisan of the First Adelartian Revolution of 983, when Jan Roycen, a famed outlaw, first inspired the people of Adelart to break the shackles of both Greifwalder and Aquileian rule, and establish a free independent territory. After Roycen found his rebellion crushed and himself beheaded, Wood took up the torch of the Adelartian revolutionaries, restructuring them among collectivist and fiercely anti-monarchist lines, with the promise of redistribution of wealth for the people and justice upon the corrupt nobles in each and every town they conquered.\n\nGreifwald, controlled by a weak and inefficient count, was beset by an Adelartian revolution that gained most of their strongholds peacefully through the people's will, with Wood's revolutionary ideals at its helm. The Sheriff, Willam Wendenal, failed to quell the revolt, with his own trusted griffons betraying him for the promise of wealth and freedom. He was beheaded soon after, and replaced by Jean Nottemagne, who reluctantly fled Adelart for good.\n\nMerlock began to re-organize the government upon libertarian, collectivist, and populist lines, with particular fury directed toward the Archonates and the Prelature of Greifwald, who suffered massive reprisals and murders at the hand of Wood's guerrilla armies. Fiercely anti-authoritarian attitudes among the revolutionaries, along with a hatred of what they believed was Maarite corruption in the church, led to Wood embracing the Old Believers, a fringe religious sect, and shaking hands with the new "Elected Prelate", Luca vun Lissay.\n\nWhile Wood has ruled for 20 years with relative stability, the people are growing restless. Hardliners clamour for Wood's removal and trial for banditry and mass murder and the establishment of true socialism, while moderates call for the end of the revolutionary period and the establishment of real democracy. If Wood is to stay, only time will tell.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
luca_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 22nd of December, 928 in Lissay\n\n§YBiography§!: The origins of Luca vun Lissay, leader of the Old Believers in Adelart and devout theologian, are a mystery to even the most loyal of his supporters. Some, the most devout loyalists to the Old Believer cause, say he was placed upon the forests of Adelart by the Gods themselves, given to a local temple to become a prophet of Eyr herself and bring down the lie of the Archonate. Even the skeptics can say little of his background - with no known parents or familial connections, Luca vun Lissay was raised by the faith, bestowing upon him a fanatic devotion to the Gods and faith - and a skepticism of the Archonate's methods that would linger for the rest of his life.\n\nSo far has the cult of personality of Luca vun Lissay risen that he has now been proclaimed the "True Prelate of Greifwald" by his supporters, despite the hierarchical hyprocrisy that the name entails. The ragged, aging priest has become a becaon of hope for the people of Adelart, and after the post-revolutionary purges of Ebonwing's loyalists, now remains the only legitimate temporal authority in the wayward province.\n\nMerlock Wood spared his sect and gave them their power, and now, Luca vun Lissay himself has taken his place. As long as he is in charge, the nobles shall once more flee in terror, and the faithless shall do nothing more but bow their heads to the Gods above.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: MonAx"
luca_archon_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 22nd of December, 928 in Lissay\n\n§YBiography§!: The origins of Archon Venia III, prophet of Eyr and devout theologian, are a mystery to even the most loyal of his supporters. Some, the most devout loyalists to the Old Believer cause, say he was placed upon the forests of Adelart by the Gods themselves, given to a local temple to become a prophet of Eyr herself and bring down the lie of the Archonate. Even the skeptics can say little of his background - with no known parents or familial connections, Venia III was raised by the faith, bestowing upon him a fanatic devotion to the Gods and faith - and a skepticism of the Arhconate's methods that would linger for the rest of his life.\n\nIt is perhaps most odd, then, than the griffon who was so fanatically against the Archonate, would become one himself, the Archon of Eyr and leader of the faithful of Griffonia. However, the griffon who was once Luca vun Lissay has declared that no longer shall this new Archonate be an oligarchy. Instead, the Archons shall be chosen by the people of Griffonia as a whole, as prelates and priests scour the nation for griffons who truly understand the faith and are ready for the burden of power. No longer shall Venia III's Archons be chosen by oligarchy and nobility - they shall be chosen from and by the truly faithful, wherever they may be.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: MonAx"
selena_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 9th of October, 961 in Lissay\n\n§YBiography§!: Selena Krafsherr has been fighting for the faith her entire life. Born to a poor but devout family of farmers on the outskirts of Lissay, Selena was their sixth child, and their fourth daughter. Neglected and impoverished, Selena left her mother's farm as soon as she came of age, and came to join the movement of Luca vun Lissay in 979, laying down her earthly possessions to accept the boon of Eyr and the Old Believers.\n\nSelena found no passion in the dull acts of priesthood, however, and decided to take matters into her own claws. During the Adelartian Revolution of 987, Selena fought for official Old Believer militia brigades, sanctioned by Luca vun Lissay. With the help of Luca, who grew attached to the fiercely religious warrior, Selena was able to found the Sisters of Eyr, an official militia of the faith.\n\nShe became an ordained "Sister" of the all-female militia, and soon attracted griffons from all over Greifwald, becoming Luca's right claw in the process. Selena pressured Luca to declare himself a Prelate to counter Greifwald, and the rest was history. Now, with the Old Belivers cemented under Luca's leadership, Selena stands as a leader of both the faith and an army. The question is what she will do with it.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Cofido"

A notable monarchist who does not even try to hide his distaste for the free territory's unique democracy, Trouillard fought in the revolution against Greifwald for Adelartian patriotism, not for Wood's values.\n\nEventually, Trouillard would leave Wood's Forest Brothers, and although he continued to serve in the armed forces, his loyalty toward Wood's government quickly faded. Now, Trouillard is perhaps Adelart's most accomplished general, and with the Sheriff already approaching him in closed-door meetings with shady deals on the table, it seems that Trouillard's faith in Adelart is simply opportunistic.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: EmpressBridle"

###########################################
OLE_army:0 "The State of the Army"
OLE_army_desc:0 "Our armies have always been comparatively small to our neighbours, and thus at a disadvantage. However with the advent of new technologies we can level the playing field with not numbers, but raw firepower."
OLE_doctrine_2:0 "Bringing out the Big Guns"
OLE_doctrine_2_desc:0 "One of the most useful tools of war ever devised is the humble cannon, and like any other tool it has only improved over the years. Several of our commanders are advocating for a new military doctrine that focuses primarily on overwhelming the enemy through sheer firepower, but quite frankly I believe they just like looking at explosions."
OLE_doctrine_1:0 "Deer on Wheels"
OLE_doctrine_1_desc:0 "The so called "tank" is a relatively new invention. The early models were not all that useful, but as the years went on the designs and the firepower slowly improved. Several of our commanders are now advocating a doctrine that would primarily focus on speed and mobility to crush our enemies before they can even react."
OLE_mot:0 "Kuorma"
OLE_mot_desc:0 "The Kuorma or the truck as it is more commonly known to non-Oleninans has recently come into use primarily for transporting goods. But several of our tacticians have suggested we strap on some armoured plates on to them and see what happens."
OLE_mech:0 "HAK"
OLE_mech_desc:0 "The HAK (Heavily Armoured Kuorma) is not merely an armoured truck, it is a really well armoured truck with a lot of guns on it. Truly we are the pinnacle of modern military science."
OLE_light_tank:0 "Haakon's Tank Experiments"
OLE_light_tank_desc:0 "Haakon Lurswig, one of our local proponents of tank warfare, has suggested we import some tanks from our Equestrian neighbours to experiment on and perhaps even use them as a basis for our own tank projects."
OLE_light_tank_tt:0 "Spawns §YThree Tank Divisions§!"
OLE_medium_tank:0 "Medium Armour Effort"
OLE_medium_tank_desc:0 "Surprisingly Haakon's experiment proved a success and have managed to convince most of our high command that tanks and mobile warfare are the way of the future, and thus they have commissioned slightly heavier tanks."
OLE_heavy_tank:0 "Tung Tanks"
OLE_heavy_tank_desc:0 "The Tung tanks are absolute monstrosities on the battlefield, having been equipped with 87MM cannons and thick armour plates on practically every inch of the hull, they are truly a sight to behold."
OLE_tank_making:0 "Mass Mobilisation"
OLE_tank_making_desc:0 "We've learnt a lot from our various tank experiments it is only natural that we use that knowledge to standardise production of spare parts, in case any accidents should occur."
OLE_super_tank:0 "The Haakonsønn"
OLE_super_tank_desc:0 "The affectionately named Haakonsønn is quite possibly Lurswig's greatest work, a monstrosity of steel and fire it will crush all who oppose Olenia beneath its treads."
OLE_support:0 "Organic Support"
OLE_support_desc:0 "Our troops can no longer rely on rifles and bayonets alone, modern warfare requires adaptable support troops such as engineers and medics to maintain the equipment and save their fellow soldiers."
OLE_better_guns:0 "Improved Equipment"
OLE_better_guns_desc:0 "Our enemies are constantly improving their equipment, and if we do not wish to be left in the dust we must too."
OLE_new_arty:0 "Massed Artillery"
OLE_new_arty_desc:0 "Our new doctrine calls for blowing the enemy sky high through massed artillery barrages, but most of our cannons are either outdated or too under-powered for such a feat. We must fix this."
OLE_computing:0 "Radio Equipment"
OLE_computing_desc:0 "Considering we will be blowing up a lot of things in the nearby  future easier communication between our troops should be among our top priorities, least we wish to suffer friendly fire."
OLE_focus_electronics:0 "The Perkele Code"
OLE_focus_electronics_desc:0 "The Perkele Code so named after it's creator Colonel Spurdo S. Perkele might be one of the most ingenious code languages ever written, with most cryptographers finding it near impossible to crack. However the truth is it isn't even a code, it's just a jumble of random Olenian words with Perkele's name thrown in there to confuse people."
OLE_better_arty:0 "Thunder and Lighting"
OLE_better_arty_desc:0 "We might as well integrate all we've learnt so far and blow our enemy sky high with massed artillery barrages rather than risk the lives of our men in pointless infantry charges."
OLE_rocketry:0 "The Spurdo Project"
OLE_rocketry_desc:0 "With the Changelings possessing a superior air force, planes would pose no real threat to them. Innovations in rocket science, however, could prove useful."
OLE_military_academy:0 "Olenian Academy of Practical Science"
OLE_military_academy_desc:0 "The newly established Olenian Academy of Practical Science or OAPS for short will prove useful in ensuring that our army's R&D department does not fall behind in creating new and improved equipment for our troops."


OLE_oppose_the_king:0 "Oppose the King"
OLE_oppose_the_king_desc:0 "Johan 'Djavulen' is an illegitimate tyrant. He has no right to rule Olenia. Higher-ups in the military and government along with the common deer are sparking protests against his rule."
OLE_The_True_Queen:0 "The True Queen"
OLE_The_True_Queen_desc:0 "Velvet, the only child of King Aldar II is the rightful ruler of Olenia. She is known for her kindness and charity work throughout the Kingdom. While she is currently exiled to Equestria, a group of supporters are planning for her return."
OLE_Coerce_Officers:0 "Convince the Officers"
OLE_Coerce_Officers_desc:0 "The army only fights for Johan out of fear. By persuading the enlisted officers, they'll push the common soldiers as well to support Velvet's cause."
OLE_Align_The_Seers:0 "The Seers' Support"
OLE_Align_The_Seers_desc:0 "The Olenian Church has been sidelined for a while, but they still hold great sway over the common deer. If we were to convince them to openly denounce Johan and his lackeys, our goals would proceed much smoother. However, the seers are certain to request a favour in return..."
OLE_Woe_To_The_Usurper:0 "Planned Sabotage"
OLE_Woe_To_The_Usurper_desc:0 "Might makes right, they say? Burn down the source of Johan's might! Without weapons, they won't be able to stop us."
OLE_Strike_At_The_Kings_Deer:0 "Remove the Kungligt Vakt"
OLE_Strike_At_The_Kings_Deer_desc:0 "Although the army reluctantly serves the King, that cannot be said for the Royal Guard, who are some of his most eager supporters. They've accrued many benefits and wealth in the previous years by enabling Johan's tyranny. It is time to lash out against the injustice."
OLE_Return_From_Exile:0 "Velvet's Return"
OLE_Return_From_Exile_desc:0 ""Johan has had plenty of time playing King. Everydeer, I have returned! Follow me, if you wish to live in a free Olenia!""
OLE_Crush_The_Oligarchs:0 "Break the Oligopoly"
OLE_Crush_The_Oligarchs_desc:0 "The staggering amount of corruption in Olenia is quite sickening. The wealthiest deer own entire farmlands, industries and even cities! Queen Velvet will personally review these properties and remove any unjustly earned excess from them."
OLE_Support_The_Working_Deer:0 "Help the Olenian Workers"
OLE_Support_The_Working_Deer_desc:0 "Few have suffered more than the common worker. 14 hour work days, miserly paycheck, no job security - this cannot be allowed. We shall institute fair and just labour laws, and show the workers that they don't need to resort to radical ideas in order to have a decent living."
OLE_Reinvigorate_The_Elksburg:0 "Invest in Elksburg"
OLE_Reinvigorate_The_Elksburg_desc:0 "The city of Elksburg is our northernmost population centre and a location of vast, yet to be unearthed natural resources. We should encourage its growth and development."
OLE_Seize_The_Agricultural_Centers:0 "Seize Unlawfully Gained Property"
OLE_Seize_The_Agricultural_Centers_desc:0 "A majority of farms in Olenia is owned by robber barons, who were allowed to gain this much under Johan. As such, the common deer has been paying exorbitant prices for even the simple loaf of bread. This ends now."
OLE_Rapid_Development:0 "Pushing Olenia to the Future"
OLE_Rapid_Development_desc:0 "While Olenia has mostly kept up with the times in industry and technology, it is simply not enough against the threats of this world. The Queen has proposed a program of rapid industrialisation and development across all regions of Olenia. Our citizens won't like this sudden encroachment, as we'll have to seize properties for factories and cut down forests, but the results will be worth it."
OLE_Bring_Back_The_Rule_Of_Law:0 "Bring Back the Rule of Law"
OLE_Bring_Back_The_Rule_Of_Law_desc:0 "Under King Johan's reign, he allowed corruption to run rampant. This morning, Her Majesty's Police Force launched an operation to arrest the worst offenders and gather evidence of their crimes. This should remind everyone that the rule of law is paramount to Olenian society."
OLE_Fate_Of_The_Usurper:0 "Decide Johan's Fate"
OLE_Fate_Of_The_Usurper_desc:0 "Olenia has seen much positive change in the past few months, but the matter of the former, now imprisoned King remains an issue for the Queen. How will she deal with her estranged half-brother?"
OLE_The_New_Monarchy:0 "Restoring Our Splendour"
OLE_The_New_Monarchy_desc:0 "Johan's antics have soured the citizens' belief in the monarchy. We must assure them that they won't suffer under a tyrant ever again, and that their rights will be upheld. Additionally, any of Johan's scions will be stripped of their privileges and benefits."
OLE_Restore_The_Riksdag:0 "Reinstate the Riksdag"
OLE_Restore_The_Riksdag_desc:0 "The Riksdag, or Eduskunta, was a national assembly of nobles, clergy and commoners that represented the deer of Olenia for hundreds of years. King Johan was quick to shut down this national institution. It is now only fair that their powers are fully reinstated and safeguards are put into place to prevent such a crime from ever happening again."
OLE_Velvetist_Economic_Plan:0 "Velvet's Economic Plan"
OLE_Velvetist_Economic_Plan_desc:0 "Her Majesty believes the best way to expand our economy is to draw upon the talents and magic of deerkind. So it shall be."
OLE_encourage_free_thought:0 "Encourage Free Thought"
OLE_encourage_free_thought_desc:0 "Under King Johan, the national schools and universities were suppressed, sending Olenia into a great brain drain. No more shall this be - everydeer is now free to express their own opinions and ideas, as long as they do not cause harm to others, and everydeer will have access to education for free."
OLE_New_Olenian_Youth:0 "Olenian Youth"
OLE_New_Olenian_Youth_desc:0 "With the rightful Queen restored, the overall demeanour of the common deer has greatly improved. So much, that the fawns have started to join our forces in joyful enthusiasm. They call themselves "Blue Antlers" and some even paint their antlers to model the Queen's. We cannot say no to these volunteers!"
OLE_Harmonist_Propaganda:0 "Promote Harmony"
OLE_Harmonist_Propaganda_desc:0 "Queen Velvet has long since fallen in love with the Equestrian way of life. Their ideas of harmony will bring everydeer closer to each other and build a strong foundation for the future of Olenia. Everydeer has it within them to be the best they can be, and through harmony they can achieve that."
OLE_Urban_Reform:0 "Planning Our Cities"
OLE_Urban_Reform_desc:0 "Olenia has plenty of major cities, but most of the population still lives in the countryside. This can be attributed to the squalor most cities find themselves in, being unable to properly support a large amount of deer living together. Our architects and designers will be given the task of resolving this issue, as cities are the way of the future."
OLE_World_Police:0 "Harmony for All"
OLE_World_Police_desc:0 "The joys of Harmony are widespread in Olenia. With our position secured, we can now help out the oppressed across the world, so that they too can live to their fullest."
OLE_A_New_Royal_Guard:0 "Our Dedicated Army"

OLE_storm_the_government_offices:0 "Storm Government Offices"
OLE_storm_the_government_offices_desc:0 "The strike has reached boiling point. It's time to take the fight to the government. We will storm and occupy offices, factories, police stations and surround the homes of the elite. We will not stop until the King is gone."
OLE_stalliongrad_support:0 "Stalliongrad Support"

OLE_reeducation:0 "Re-education"

OLE_three_year_plan:0 "Three-Year Plan"
OLE_three_year_plan_desc:0 "The Three-Year Plan is designed to bring Olenia into the modern age through the process of industrialisation and worker self-management. It is predicted that Olenia can become a fully modernised state in only three years, so long as the workers embrace the process."
OLE_workers_future:0 "The Worker's Future"
OLE_workers_future_desc:0 "The past is full of nothing but tyrants and the suffering of the proletariat. We must wipe away all traces of Olenia's past lest we return to such barbaric ways. There never was a King. There never were tyrants. There has only been the worker and there will always be the worker."
OLE_workers_throughout_the_ages:0 "Workers Throughout the Ages"
OLE_workers_throughout_the_ages_desc:0 "The past is the common history of all Olenians. We must embrace our traditions and our culture and merge it with the communist ideals. By remembering the past, we will never again repeat it."

OLE_agrarian_reform:0 "Agrarian Reform"
OLE_agrarian_reform_desc:0 "For centuries, the deer of Olenia have lived by their own means, barely surviving off the land under their local lords. Now it's the time to empower the farmers and collectivise their efforts to ensure that no deer ever starves again."
OLE_communal_mines:0 "Communal Mines"
OLE_communal_mines_desc:0 "Olenia is a land full of rich and plentiful resources, but the mine bosses exploited the common deer and the mines were drenched with the blood of the workers.

OLE_crush_the_resistance:0 "Crush the Resistance"
OLE_crush_the_resistance_desc:0 "There are those who dare object to the rule of King Johan. We must seek them out and deal with them. But first, we need allies amongst the nobility - or perhaps we could turn to the Church for help?"
OLE_plactate_the_nobles:0 "Placate the Nobles"
OLE_plactate_the_nobles_desc:0 "The noble houses of Olenia have long ruled over the land. While many support King Johan's rule, there are many others who are disinterested or outright defy the King. We must seek accommodation with these nobles and bring them to the King's side."

OLE_leave_the_old_guard_in_charge_desc:0 "The Royal Cabinet is full of old lords loyal to King Aldar II. While there are some who despise Johan's rule, they know how to manage the affairs of the nation better than anyone. By seeking their support, we can cement the King's rule over the nation."
OLE_reshuffle_the_cabinet:0 "Reshuffle the Cabinet"
OLE_reshuffle_the_cabinet_desc:0 "The Royal Cabinet should be replaced by those loyal to King Johan's rule, bankers, industrialists and all other self-made deer. By putting them in a position of power we can increase the nation's wealth."
OLE_new_privileges:0 "New Privileges"
OLE_new_privileges_desc:0 "For long the nobility have benefited from many privileges over the deer of Olenia. By extending the privileges to the capitalists, merchants, bankers and others in positions of financial power we can help support the growth of the Olenian economy."
OLE_support_the_oligarchs:0 "Support the Oligarchs"

OLE_land_owners:0 "The Landowners"
OLE_land_owners_desc:0 "Olenia's mountains are full of untold riches that are as of yet barely harvested, and Olenia's farms are barely more than small gardens built only to feed a few. Buy supporting the landowners, we can encourage the peasants to grow and harvest more to feed the nation."
OLE_reinforce_old_hierarchies:0 "Reinforce the Old Hierarchies"
OLE_reinforce_old_hierarchies_desc:0 "In days of old, there was a strict hierarchy among the deer of Olenia. From the lowest doe to the King himself, all had their place.

OLE_a_dynasty_to_last:0 "A Dynasty to Last"
OLE_a_dynasty_to_last_desc:0 "Johan may not be immortal, yet, but his legacy can be. Never again shall a Queen sit on the Olenian throne.

OLE_army:0 "The State of the Army"
OLE_army_desc:0 "Our armies have always been comparatively small to our neighbours, and thus at a disadvantage. However with the advent of new technologies we can level the playing field with not numbers, but raw firepower."
OLE_doctrine_2:0 "Bringing out the Big Guns"
OLE_doctrine_2_desc:0 "One of the most useful tools of war ever devised is the humble cannon, and like any other tool it has only improved over the years. Several of our commanders are advocating for a new military doctrine that focuses primarily on overwhelming the enemy through sheer firepower, but quite frankly I believe they just like looking at explosions."
OLE_doctrine_1:0 "Deer on Wheels"
OLE_doctrine_1_desc:0 "The so called "tank" is a relatively new invention. The early models were not all that useful, but as the years went on the designs and the firepower slowly improved. Several of our commanders are now advocating a doctrine that would primarily focus on speed and mobility to crush our enemies before they can even react."
OLE_mot:0 "Kuorma"
OLE_mot_desc:0 "The Kuorma or the truck as it is more commonly known to non-Oleninans has recently come into use primarily for transporting goods. But several of our tacticians have suggested we strap on some armoured plates on to them and see what happens."
OLE_mech:0 "HAK"
OLE_mech_desc:0 "The HAK (Heavily Armoured Kuorma) is not merely an armoured truck, it is a really well armoured truck with a lot of guns on it. Truly we are the pinnacle of modern military science."
OLE_light_tank:0 "Haakon's Tank Experiments"

OLE_medium_tank:0 "Medium Armour Effort"

OLE_heavy_tank:0 "Tung Tanks"
OLE_heavy_tank_desc:0 "The Tung tanks are absolute monstrosities on the battlefield, having been equipped with 87MM cannons and thick armour plates on practically every inch of the hull, they are truly a sight to behold."
OLE_tank_making:0 "Mass Mobilisation"
OLE_tank_making_desc:0 "We've learnt a lot from our various tank experiments it is only natural that we use that knowledge to standardise production of spare parts, in case any accidents should occur."
OLE_super_tank:0 "The Haakonsønn"
OLE_super_tank_desc:0 "The affectionately named Haakonsønn is quite possibly Lurswig's greatest work, a monstrosity of steel and fire it will crush all who oppose Olenia beneath its treads."
OLE_support:0 "Organic Support"

OLE_new_arty:0 "Massed Artillery"

OLE_computing:0 "Radio Equipment"
OLE_computing_desc:0 "Considering we will be blowing up a lot of things in the nearby  future easier communication between our troops should be among our top priorities, least we wish to suffer friendly fire."
OLE_electronics:0 "The Perkele Code"
OLE_electronics_desc:0 "The Perkele Code so named after it's creator Colonel Spurdo S. Perkele might be one of the most ingenious code languages ever written, with most cryptographers finding it near impossible to crack. However the truth is it isn't even a code, it's just a jumble of random Olenian words with Perkele's name thrown in there to confuse people."
OLE_better_arty:0 "Thunder and Lighting"
OLE_better_arty_desc:0 "We might as well integrate all we've learnt so far and blow our enemy sky high with massed artillery barrages rather than risk the lives of our men in pointless infantry charges."
OLE_rocketry:0 "The Spurdo Project"
OLE_rocketry_desc:0 "With the Changelings possessing a superior air force, planes would pose no real threat to them. Innovations in rocket science, however, could prove useful."

OLE_military_academy_desc:0 "The newly established Olenian Academy of Practical Science or OAPS for short will prove useful in ensuring that our army's R&D department does not fall behind in creating new and improved equipment for our troops."

OLE_bring_back_rule_of_law_desc:0 "Under King Johan's reign, he allowed corruption to run rampant.

OLE_reinstate_parliament:0 "Reinstate the Riksdag"
OLE_reinstate_parliament_desc:0 "The Riksdag, or Eduskunta, was a national assembly of nobles, clergy and commoners that represented the deer of Olenia for hundreds of years.

OLE_promote_harmony:0 "Promote Harmony"
OLE_promote_harmony_desc:0 "Queen Velvet has long since fallen in love with the Equestrian way of life.

OLE_encourage_free_thought:0 "Encourage Free Thought"
OLE_encourage_free_thought_desc:0 "Under King Johan, the national schools and universities were suppressed, sending Olenia into a great brain drain.

OLE_queen_velvet_academy:0 "Queen Velvet Academy"
OLE_queen_velvet_academy_desc:0 "The Queen Velvet Academy is a new national university dedicated to providing the best education to everydeer willing to enrol. Modelled after Celestia’s School, it is an institution which will ensure that never again will Olenia suffer at the hands of self-made tyrants."
OLE_equestrian_investment:0 "Equestrian Investment"
OLE_equestrian_investment_desc:0 "It is no lie that our industrial capabilities are far behind that of our Equestrian neighbours. We should lift trade and investment restrictions and open ourselves as a new and profitable venture for Equestrian investment, so that we both may profit."
OLE_equal_with_equestria:0 "Equals with Equestria"
OLE_equal_with_equestria_desc:0 "While Equestria and Olenia are both great nations, we should walk our own paths in this world."

OLE_storm_the_government_offices_desc:0 "The strike has reached boiling point. It's time to take the fight to the government. We will storm and occupy offices, factories, police stations and surround the homes of the elite. We will not stop until the King is gone."

OLE_three_year_plan:0 "Three-Year Plan"
OLE_three_year_plan_desc:0 "The Three-Year Plan is designed to bring Olenia into the modern age through the process of industrialisation and worker self-management. It is predicted that Olenia can become a fully modernised state in only three years, so long as the workers embrace the process."
OLE_workers_future:0 "The Worker's Future"
OLE_workers_future_desc:0 "The past is full of nothing but tyrants and the suffering of the proletariat. We must wipe away all traces of Olenia’s past lest we return to such barbaric ways.

OLE_workers_throughout_the_ages:0 "Workers Throughout the Ages"

OLE_agrarian_reform_desc:0 "For centuries, the deer of Olenia have lived by their own means, barely surviving off the land under their local lords. Now it’s the time to empower the farmers and collectivise their efforts to ensure that no deer ever starves again."
OLE_communal_mines:0 "Communal Mines"
OLE_communal_mines_desc:0 "Olenia is a land full of rich and plentiful resources, but the mine bosses exploited the common deer and the mines were drenched with the blood of the workers.

OLE_crush_the_resistance:0 "Crush the Resistance"
OLE_crush_the_resistance_desc:0 "There are those who dare object to the rule of King Johan. We must seek them out and deal with them. But first, we need allies amongst the nobility - or perhaps we could turn to the Church for help?"

OLE_plactate_the_nobles_desc:0 "The noble houses of Olenia have long ruled over the land. While many support King Johan’s rule, there are many others who are disinterested or outright defy the King. We must seek accommodation with these nobles and bring them to the King’s side."

OLE_land_owners:0 "The Landowners"
OLE_land_owners_desc:0 "Olenia’s mountains are full of untold riches that are as of yet barely harvested, and Olenia’s farms are barely more than small gardens built only to feed a few. Buy supporting the landowners, we can encourage the peasants to grow and harvest more to feed the nation."

OLE_reinforce_old_hierarchies_desc:0 "In days of old, there was a strict hierarchy among the deer of Olenia. From the lowest doe to the King himself, all had their place.

A fierce firefight broke out throughout the city and by nightfall it was under royalist control.\n\nAcross the nation, royalists, liberals and harmonists took up arms to free themselves from communist oppression.

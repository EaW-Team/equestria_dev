CYA_consolidate_our_forces:0 "Consolidate Our Forces"
CYA_consolidate_our_forces_desc:0 "Our army is in disarray, the command hierarchy is a confusing bind, we cannot even agree on the style of our uniforms. It is time to bring order in our land forces. Painful, but necessary."
CYA_army1:0 "Army Reforms"
CYA_army1_desc:0 "Modern militaries require contemporary structures, and ours is quite outdated. Let us begin our reforms from the basics."
CYA_officer_cadre:0 "Officer Cadres"
CYA_officer_cadre_desc:0 "Our forces could benefit from new leadership in the field. Our officers have grown content and stagnant in their role, leading to decreased army performance. Let us reverse this trend."
CYA_mil_radio:0 "Military Radio"
CYA_mil_radio_desc:0 "The radio, as an invention, is rather widespread in Cyanolisia, brought by Wingbardian traders, but we do not have the means to produce our own. The military is interested in adopting it for their own use, but we must first reverse engineer the technology to fulfill our requirements, particularly in encrypting radio signal frequencies."
CYA_army_sailor_brigades:0 "Form Sailor Brigades"
CYA_army_sailor_brigades_desc:0 "In the past, the Imperial Southern Fleet had its home port in our capital of Thymíaustadt. Today, the Southern Fleet is long gone, although many of its erstwhile sailors still remain in our country. They are dispossessed yet able-bodied and well-trained griffons, and so we will arm them and organise them into landbound brigades to serve and fight once more."
CYA_logistics_company:0 "Military Logistics"
CYA_logistics_company_desc:0 "An army marches on its supplies, and with the situation in Cyanolisia, foraging cannot be relied on at all to provide necessary items for the troops. A dedicated logistics squadron will be formed to support our brave soldiers."
CYA_officers:0 "Army Command Office"
CYA_officers_desc:0 "There is more to leading than pointing your weapon at the enemy - our officers and generals must have a centralised commander centre where they can plan our operations in the theater. While it is true that a plan never survives first contact with the enemy, we can at least try to minimise the danger for our regular troops."
CYA_army6:0 "The Army Construction Corps"
CYA_army6_desc:0 "In times of war, we cannot completely rely on the civilian sector to provide timely construction, repairs and everything else our forces might require in their operations. Thus we have seen fit to raise a specialised corps to handle this sort of predicament." 
CYA_army7:0 "Knightly Heavy Infantry"
CYA_army7_desc:0 "The gallant spirit of the knights has never died out! With proper training and equipment, they shall be able to handle any obstacle. It just might be a suitable replacement until we can get our armoured vehicle production up and going."
CYA_army8:0 "Panzer Modernisation"
CYA_army8_desc:0 "Initial results of the armoured vehicle program has been very promising, and we are confident that should it receive some dedicated funding, we can create a model that will be ahead of its time. Cyanolisia needs every advantage it can get."
CYA_support_comp:0 "Military Engineers"
CYA_support_comp_desc:0 "In order to effectively wage war, we require pioneers and sappers. These brave griffons will build fortifications, clear areas from danger, and erect temporary bridges. The physical environment will be theirs to shape."
CYA_inf_guns:0 "Small-Arms Modernisation"
CYA_inf_guns_desc:0 "The troops have been complaining about having to use outdated firearms for a while now. We've heard their concerns, and we shall commence designing a more contemporary rifle for the rank and file soldier."
CYA_artillery_stuff:0 "Artillery Modernisation"
CYA_artillery_stuff_desc:0 "A routine inspection of our ordnance supply has revealed various faults at claw, such as defective pieces, usage of outdated models such as demi-cannons, and lacklustre training on the soldiers' part. It would be best to make our current priority bringing order to the artillery battalions."
CYA_army_motorization:0 "Army Motorisation"
CYA_army_motorization_desc:0 "Efforts shall be placed into improving the mobility of our armed forces. But to commence with our plans, we first require a reliable vehicle to carry troops and supplies."
CYA_mountain_guns:0 "Mountain Guns"
CYA_mountain_guns_desc:0 "Artillery wins wars, but deploying it on hills and mountains is a fool's task. Efforts must be placed into designing more managable, smaller ordnance pieces that can handle rough terrain without sacrificing their accuracy and firepower."
CYA_armor_workshops:0 "Armour Workshops"
CYA_armor_workshops_desc:0 "Although the industry required to mass produce armoured vehicles does not exist in Cyanolisia currently, it would still be wise to place a portion of our budget into researching tank designs, so that we do not remain too far behind other, more modern nations."
CYA_magical_weapons:0 "Magical Weapons"
CYA_magical_weapons_desc:0 "Reports of firearms that utilise magical crystals as ammunition have been dismissed as a delusion, but a recent breakthrough from our scientists have made a reality. Although they currently suffer from reliability issues, we are confident that we can improve them until they completely replace regular rifles."
CYA_modernizing_army:0 "Army Doctrinal Modernisation"
CYA_modernizing_army_desc:0 "The outdated doctrine we inherited from the Griffonian Empire is no longer optimal for our strategy. Our theorists will begin researching and experimenting with new tactics and options."
CYA_army_laboratories:0 "The Army Research Division"
CYA_army_laboratories_desc:0 "The armed forces require specialised research facilities and equipment that simply cannot be trusted to the civilian sector. With issues like bureaucracy and funding out of the way, these scientists will focus exclusively on improving our armies in every possible aspect."
CYA_pilot_training:0 "Army Pilot Training"
CYA_pilot_training_desc:0 "Operating an airplane is a strenuous task, and we must ensure every recruit for the airforce receives proper training so that their performance in the field is not diminished. The number of volunteers for the new air branch is vast, but only the best will be admitted."
CYA_build_air_bases:0 "Build Airstrips"
CYA_build_air_bases_desc:0 "Planes require an extensive amount of space to operate properly. Fortunately, we own plenty of empty fields which are more than suitable for the construction for hangars and airfields."
CYA_air_support_effort:0 "CAS Effort"
CYA_air_support_effort_desc:0 "Airplanes bring a new dimension to warfare, giving us options that were previously unavailable. For example, a sturdy fortification or trench can now be assaulted by aircraft carrying explosive payloads, saving many lives of the regular troops. Thus it is imperative that we develop these airplane designs as well, and put them into production."
CYA_fighter_effort:0 "Fighter Effort"
CYA_fighter_effort_desc:0 "Theorists are suggesting that the most important battles will not be waged on land, but rather in the air. The one to control the skies will control the outcome of the war, and if we wish to be the victors, we require a dedicated fighter plane to maintain dominance of the skies."
CYA_air_auxiliary:0 "Air Auxiliaries"
CYA_air_auxiliary_desc:0 "Griffons are at their natural in the sky - thus it is only fitting we make use of our talents to improve the performance of our airplanes. Better training, more air bases, there is plenty of room to expand our options."
CYA_bomber_effort:0 "Bomber Effort"
CYA_bomber_effort_desc:0 "Once the control of the skies is secured, we can move in with the second wave of attack: bombers. These large, durable planes will carry a destructive payload, and they shall reduce any obstacle, be it bunkers, cities or even naval warships to flaming wreckage. This will secure our victory."
CYA_aviation_corps:0 "The Army Aviation Corps"
CYA_aviation_corps_desc:0 "With the growing progress of our air corps, we now find ourselves in need to create a dedicated training and housing facility for all our pilots. There, they will receive the best training we can afford, ensuring their skills stay sharp and chances of any accidents will be minimised."
CYA_rocket_science:0 "Rocket Science"
CYA_rocket_science_desc:0 "Jet engines and rockets are promising a new age in warfare. Although we can currently only produce experimental prototypes, with enough funding we can propel ourselves to the future and ahead of our rivals."


CYA_coastal_railway:0 "Build the Coastal Railway"
CYA_coastal_railway_desc:0 "The first step in furthering our meagre industrial base is to connect our coastal cities by a modern railway. Transportation of goods and griffons will become much safer and quicker, no longer troubled by the marauding bulls."
CYA_coastal_towns:0 "Develop the Coastal Towns"
CYA_coastal_towns_desc:0 "There is plenty of unused land available for construction of new factories, military bases or simply more homes for our people. We should purchase this land for our future projects."
CYA_manufactory:0 "Satellite Manufactories"
CYA_manufactory_desc:0 "The city of Thymíaustadt is our most prized jewel, certainly, but we cannot develop it exclusively at the expense of others. See to it that our other coastal cities of Salmarkt and Auropallieta receive funding for their new industrial designs as well."
CYA_arsenal:0 "The Tarmuth Arsenal"
CYA_arsenal_desc:0 "Cyanolisia lives and dies based on its firearms. For a long time, we could not produce new weaponry or even purchase from abroad. Now, however, we can correct that, and dedicated firearm factories in our industrial satellite of Tarmuth will ensure every soldier has their gun."
CYA_company:0 "Support the Horst Trading Company"
CYA_company_desc:0 "We have come to rely on a number of trading companies that have set up their base of operations in our prized cities. The largest and most profitable of these, the Horst Handelsunternehmen, can offer us just what we need, for some concessions and funding. We'd be wise to become their patron."
CYA_town_stuff:0 "Sponsor the Auropallieta Dockyards"
CYA_town_stuff_desc:0 "To protect our homeland from the hated minotaurs, we must expand our existing naval capabilities, so that we can construct more ships and screening vessels. This will come at the expense of other opportunities, but it is the grim reality."
CYA_town_stuff2:0 "Sponsor the Port of Salmarkt"
CYA_town_stuff2_desc:0 "Although Salmarkt has only recently been passed to our care, its location has been very profitable for our trading business. Nogriff can object towards having more money, and thus we shall expand the shipping capabilities of the Salmarkt port."
CYA_town_stuff3:0 "Horst Oil Refineries"
CYA_town_stuff3_desc:0 "The Horst Handelsunternehmen has come up with a yet another brilliant idea for solving our lack of strategic resources - synthetic oil and rubber refineries. By using only a small portion of the actual resource, we can ease the demand and produce decent replacements. All they ask in return is a plot of land and a cut of the profits."
CYA_industrialise_fragrantharbour:0 "Develop Thymíaushafen"
CYA_industrialise_fragrantharbour_desc:0 "The Thymíaustadt harbour could use an expansion. We have already located good areas to build new wharfs, piers and docks. We only need to start working."
CYA_steelworks:0 "The Thymíaustadt Steelworks"
CYA_steelworks_desc:0 "Steel is a vital resource for the production of almost everything we require, be it buildings or weapons. As such, it would be prudent to expand our existing steel mills into something that can produce an actual difference for the state."  
CYA_outback_oil:0 "Oil In the Outback"
CYA_outback_oil_desc:0 "The griffons are rightfully frightened of the outback, but we cannot completely ignore it. A rather bold surveyor has located oil deposits in the jungles of Cannabia, and its location is relatively easy to access and protect from the cow tribals. Every bit helps, certainly."
CYA_special_industry:0 "Cannabia Special Industries"
CYA_special_industry_desc:0 "Would you look at that. Following our success in securing the oil well, we have uncovered a deposit of rare magical crystals. While we currently do not have a practical use for it, we know plenty of others who do, and would pay a pretty coin for them. A factory will be opened to process this new resource, as well."
CYA_griffon_institute_of_science:0 "Naval Institute of Science"
CYA_griffon_institute_of_science_desc:0 "The researchers are promising great advancements, but their facilities and funding are insufficient for their grand designs. Given their previous successes, we see the merit in their plea. The results will quickly follow."
CYA_industrial_stuff:0 "Steelworks Expansion"
CYA_industrial_stuff_desc:0 "The new steelworks are already producing much, helping our efforts, but there is more we require than just plain steel. Additional plants for the processing of the more rare metals will be commissioned and built, both in our capital and its satellites of De Aguilar, Tarmuth, and Espelho Mar."
CYA_industrial_stuff2:0 "The Thymíau RADAR Tower"
CYA_industrial_stuff2_desc:0 "The splendid new invention called RADAR will change much in the future of warfare. After all, knowing where the enemy is at all times is an invaluable knowledge, and we should aim towards improving this technology."
CYA_modern_computation_machines:0 "Modern Computing Machines"
CYA_modern_computation_machines_desc:0 "The bright future lies within electronics, in these complicated machines that can replace the work of dozens. With these "computers" focusing on menial tasks, our research base is free to handle more pressing concerns, improving our knowledge at large."
CYA_industrial_stuff3:0 "Construction R&D"
CYA_industrial_stuff3_desc:0 "There is more to building a house or digging a mine than just raising support beams and ensuring the floor is even. Yes indeed, we shall aim towards combining our existing building methods with modern tools and vehicles. It will considerably improve our progress."
CYA_industrial_stuff4:0 "The Bright Future in Science"
CYA_industrial_stuff4_desc:0 "Despite our many difficulties in achieving progress, our hard work has paid off and now we reap the benefits. Our griffons are brighter and more productive by the day, and this is reflected in the increased amount of population capable of handling more demanding tasks. Three cheers for Cyanolisia!"


CYA_expand_capital_docks:0 "Expand the Thymíaustadt Docks"
CYA_expand_capital_docks_desc:0 "The Thymíaustadt piers are in a rather decrepit state. In order to restore the glory of the old Imperial Fleet, we must repair these docks and construct additional ones."
CYA_found_admiralty:0 "Reform the Admiralty Office"
CYA_found_admiralty_desc:0 "The ad hoc arrangements which managed our navy are no longer acceptable. We require a properly trained secretariat, which will consist of griffons who are knowledgeable in all matters naval, instead of admirals and officers too old to walk the quarterdeck. This will drastically improve our fleet's performance."
CYA_found_capital_shipyards:0 "Sponsor the Horst Shipyards"
CYA_found_capital_shipyards_desc:0 "The ever reliable Horst Handelsunternehmen has an another great offer for us: they'll build new shipyards in exchange for tax concessions. With our pressing need to rebuild the fleet, we can afford the smaller yearly tax income."
CYA_build_a_navy:0 "Rebuild Our Navy"
CYA_build_a_navy_desc:0 "With preparations completed, the actual work can now begin. The waves will be ruled by Cyanolisia once more! After the lengthy construction period, of course."
CYA_screening_effort:0 "Screening Ships Effort"
CYA_screening_effort_desc:0 "The smallest warship class, destroyers are excellent for scouting and hunting down submarines. Since it will take a considerable amount of time before we can build larger ships, it would be best to modernise our dated Imperial designs."
CYA_cruiser_effort:0 "Cruiser Effort"
CYA_cruiser_effort_desc:0 "With destroyers acting as our screening vessels, cruisers of both light and heavy variant can act as a stopgap before we can develop larger warships. They can supplement our patrol forces, as well."
CYA_raise_the_austernfischer:0 "§HRaise the Austernfischer§!"
CYA_raise_the_austernfischer_desc:0 "The flagship of the erstwhile Imperial Southern Fleet, the Austernfischer was sunk just off the shore of Thymíaushafen by a minotaurian bomb which blew a hole in its hull. This was ten years ago, when Asterion seceded. Today, with modern salvaging techniques at our disposal, we can attempt to refloat the sunken battlecruiser, which will make a fine addition to our fledging navy."
CYA_capital_ship_effort:0 "Capital Ships Effort"
CYA_capital_ship_effort_desc:0 "We finally have the means and funding to begin the construction of largest warships - but first we require a reliable design. Lessons learned from the Austernfischer's model will considerably aid in this endeavour."
CYA_submarine_effort:0 "Submarine Effort"
CYA_submarine_effort_desc:0 "Submarines are undoubtedly going to be the turning point in naval warfare. No ship, no matter how heavily armoured, will not be safe anymore. Our enemies' trade lanes will be under constant threat. All we require for this is a working model."
CYA_the_aeronaval_corps:0 "Form the Aeronaval Corps"
CYA_carrier_effort:0 "Carrier Effort"
CYA_carrier_effort_desc:0 "Some of our admirals believe warships are a dying breed in the new millennia, and that we should focus on converting our hulls to carry airplanes. They argue that should these carriers be well protected by screening vessels, they can damage enemy ships before they can retaliate, forcing them to retreat. We see wisdom in this thinking, and we shall focus on building our first carrier designs."
CYA_carrier_building_facility:0 "Carrier Construction Facilities"
CYA_carrier_building_facility_desc:0 "With our first carrier blueprint finalised and approved, we can commence construction. But first we require an expansion of dockyards - Thymíaustadt has room for an another pier. Additionally, rare metals will be imported to smoothen the construction of this new warship, so that we don't end up forced to use inferior replacements."
CYA_seaplane_effort:0 "Seaplane Designs"
CYA_seaplane_effort_desc:0 "Airplanes require vast modifications in order to be able to use carriers as a launching pad. Existing models will be experimented with until we can find a satisfactory balance of firepower, range and weight."
CYA_seebataillon:0 "Form Seebataillons"
CYA_seebataillon_desc:0 "Cyanolisia lives and thrives by its long coast. It can be said that the griffons here are quite familiar with the sea - and this is our logic behind forming the Seebataillons. A specialised force adapt in amphibious warfare, to lead the assault on the enemy's beaches."
CYA_naval_assault_effort:0 "Naval Assault Effort"
CYA_torpedo_destroyers:0 "Torpedo Cruisers"
CYA_form_naval_paratroopers:0 "Form Naval Paratrooper Battalions"


CYA_the_conference_at_evosmoshafen:0 "The Conference at Salmarkt"
CYA_the_conference_at_evosmoshafen_desc:0 "Stranded for decades in this hostile outback land, we have persevered. But it was not without difficulty. Vengeance driven beasts, the minotaurs threaten to overrun all we hold dear. The Countess has decided to hold a meeting with the highest ranking commanders in Salmarkt, in order to decide our future course of action."
CYA_the_group_of_twenty:0 "The Group of Twenty"
CYA_the_group_of_twenty_desc:0 "A group of officers within the Cyanolisian military has been dissatisfied with the nation's state for a long time. Despite the vast spectre of ideological differences between them, they've put aside their quarrels and agreed on one thing: the current regime must go, and a socialist utopia will rise from its ashes."
CYA_form_sailors_committees:0 "Form Sailor's Committees"
CYA_form_sailors_committees_desc:0 "It is imperative to secure the support of our seagriffons. Having the navy on our side could make all the difference should internal strife occur, but we might also be able to seize leadership without any blood spilled."
CYA_the_anarchists_and_equalists:0 "The Anarchists and Equalists"
CYA_the_anarchists_and_equalists_desc:0 "While we all share the vision of a socialist Cyanolisia, there are multiple viewpoints on how it should be achieved. Some groups hold radically different positions compared to Equestrian socialism, and could disrupt our plot. On the other claw, we need every griffon for our cause. How should we proceed?"
CYA_radicalising_the_troops:0 "Radicalising the Troops"
CYA_radicalising_the_troops_desc:0 "It is known that the military has little love for the perpetual siege we are subjected towards in Cyanolisia, and we can use this to our advantage. However, we will only have enough time to convince one group - the officers or the common soldiers."
CYA_liasing_with_the_indigenes:0 "Liasing with the Indigenes"
CYA_liasing_with_the_indigenes_desc:0 "Some find it distasteful, but the native minotaurs could prove to be a valuable ally. One of our goals is to stop the needless hatred between the two species, and we shall approach the tribal leaders. Common ground can and will be found."
CYA_coordinating_with_the_cadres:0 "Coordinating With the Cadres"
CYA_coordinating_with_the_cadres_desc:0 "The majority of griffons in Cyanolisia inhabit our coastal cities, and they are having firstclaw experience of the oppression forced unto them by the capitalists. The workers are our natural ally in the revolution, but we could consider convincing the despised bourgeoisie - their influence could ensure a smooth transition."
CYA_roll_the_die:0 "Roll The Die"
CYA_roll_the_die_desc:0 "Words will not be enough to overthrow the current regime, this is certain. Only a violent revolution can ensure a proper beginning of a pure, socialist nation. Down with the Countess! Down with the tyranny!"
CYA_the_officers_putsch:0 "The Officers' Putsch"
CYA_the_officers_putsch_desc:0 "We are confident that we've achieved sufficient support for our cause. Countess Sumpfkiel will have no choice but to abdicate and leave the country once she sees the overwhelming strength of the revolution. Our demands will be presented at the next session of the Countess' court, set to occur in three days..."
CYA_our_finest_hour:0 "Our Finest Hour"
CYA_our_finest_hour_desc:0 "Our plot has resolved in the most remarkable manner and we now have control over Cyanolisia. Let the people celebrate, for a brighter age is to come! The first order of business is to hold free elections to determine the direction of our nation. We are confident the people will choose wisely."
CYA_democratic_socialism:0 "The Neue Demokratische Sozialismuspartei"
CYA_democratic_socialism_desc:0 "The people have chosen the Neue Demokratische Sozialismuspartei to lead the nation. They promise equality without racism, prosperity without exploitation and liberty without oppression. Peace, bread and democracy for all, no matter the race or class!" ##thanks Horsie :wink:##
CYA_equalism:0 "The Radikale Gleichheitspartei"
CYA_equalism_desc:0 "The election results have come in, and the Cyanolisians have chosen the Radikale Gleichheitspartei to lead them to a new dawn. A large number of the minotaurs who have shown up have cast their vote for them, enticed by their promises of an equal society. Rebuilding can now commence."
CYA_equal_rights_bill:0 "Equal Rights Bill"
CYA_equal_rights_bill_desc:0 "The first step in healing this nation is the introduction of the equal rights bill - from now on, every griffon, pony, minotaur, zebra - in short, everycreature will be equal, regardless of their occupation, living habitat or beliefs. That way, our society will beging mending itself."
CYA_abolish_private_ownership:0 "Abolish Private Ownership"
CYA_abolish_private_ownership_desc:0 "Ownership is a disease that will cause strife in our equal society. We need to ensure nocreature owns no more than the other. Whether in poverty or in prosperity, we all share the same burden, but our goal is the same as well."
CYA_land_redistribution:0 "Land Redistribution"
CYA_land_redistribution_desc:0 "The bourgeoisie have unjustly occupied vast swathes of land in order to fund their illicit, greedy schemes. These will be taken by the state, and redistributed to each according to their need."
CYA_communist_patriotism:0 "Revolutionary Patriotism"
CYA_communist_patriotism_desc:0 "Military service has been regarded as distasteful, if necessary, for a long time in Cyanolisia. This meant that volunteers were few and between, but now, the people are much more eager to join our armed forces. The decades old siege mentality has come to an end."
CYA_unions_in_politics:0 "Unions in Politics"
CYA_unions_in_politics_desc:0 "The unions, which protect the workers from exploitation, must have a say in the workings of the government. They will ensure that new laws and regulations are not made to the detriment of the proletariat."
CYA_mixed_species_brigades:0 "Mixed-Species Battalions"
CYA_mixed_species_brigades_desc:0 "The next step in achieving our equal society is by forming military units containing multiple species. This experiment has two goals - to see if combat performance remains optimal, and to convince the remainder of the army to slowly adopt this unit formation."
CYA_horizontalised_military_structure:0 "Horizontalised Military Structure"
CYA_horizontalised_military_structure_desc:0 "The armed forces shall march as one and fight as one - the strict hierarchy has only shackled the common soldier. Now freed from their chains, they shall fight with unmatched fervour."
CYA_equalist_society:0 "Equalist Society"
CYA_equalist_society_desc:0 "So many nations and societies across the world would be far off better if they adopted our way of thinking. It is the duty of every proud citizen of Our Cyanolisia to spread the virtues of equality!"
CYA_collectivisation:0 "Agrarian Collectivisation"
CYA_collectivisation_desc:0 "Farmland and other properties which produce food must be seized for the good of the state, so that we can reform the way of production according to our ideals. We expect that initially there will be a lack of food as the farmers adjust to new quotas and regulations, but the results will be more than promising."
CYA_military_commissars:0 "Military Commissars"
CYA_military_commissars_desc:0 "While it was the armed forces who liberated Cyanolisia, we believe it would be wise to keep an eye on them. Anti-revolutionary sentiment cannot be allowed to fester, and these valiant commissars will ensure ideological purity in the army, as well as inspire the troops to new heights of bravery."
CYA_the_means_of_production:0 "Seize the Means of Production"
CYA_the_means_of_production_desc:0 "The state requires all of its materials, industry, infrastructure to further its goal. No longer shall we sell our hard work to the foreign capitalists, who would extort us and never give their fair share."
CYA_miners_collectives:0 "Form Miners Collectives"
CYA_miners_collectives_desc:0 "The miners are some of the most vulnerable classes in the nation. Working long hours in dangerous conditions for a miserly paycheck, exploited harshly by the capitalist oppressors. This changes now, and the ownership of the mines goes towards those who work in them. Productivity and morale will increase."
CYA_national_health_bureau:0 "Form the National Health Bureau"
CYA_national_health_bureau_desc:0 "Basic healthcare, provided by the state, is the right of every citizen. We must ensure this privilege becomes a reality for every Cyanolisian, regardless of their wealth or social standing. The humid climate of southern Griffonia is a breeding ground for sickness, after all."
CYA_free_education:0 "Free Education"
CYA_free_education_desc:0 "A literate citizen is a free citizen - and we must ensure everycreature receives basic education. The perfect opportunity to spread our values, as well."
CYA_intercommunalism:0 "Intercommunalism"
CYA_intercommunalism_desc:0 "With our affairs in order, the time has come to spread the values of socialism to our neighbours. The workers will rise, and we will not compromise! The oppressive feudal overlords must all go, into the annals of history where they belong, never to return!"
CYA_liberate_the_north:0 "Liberate the North"
CYA_liberate_the_north_desc:0 "The nations of the Evi Valley are being ruled by oppressive feudal monarchs and thieving thugs. Of particular note is the despised tyrant Kloseu, who is rumoured to have killed every communist supporter in Prywhen. They will be avenged! We must intervene to bring socialism to their lands." 
CYA_liberate_the_west:0 "Liberate the West"
CYA_liberate_the_west_desc:0 "Falcor and Sicameon languish in their underdeveloped, rural states. Their leaders promise progress, but they are liars, leeching off the work of the proletariat! We must march forth and free the workers. With every nation following our cause, the proletariat across the world will unite!"
CYA_into_the_world:0 "Into The World"
CYA_into_the_world_desc:0 "With our immediate neighbours flying proudly the red flag, our goal has been achieved. But there are still workers across the world, toiling and slaving away for a pittance, yearning to be released from their shackles! Let the world know Cyanolisia supports the liberation of the proletariat in every nation!"
CYA_communist_future:0 "A Communist Future"
CYA_communist_future_desc:0 "Cyanolisia has progressed greatly in the past few years. From a backwater County besieged by minotaurs, we became a proud nation free from its woes and exploiters. This is reflected in our literate, free citizenry, who are living happy and fulfilled lives. The future is here."
CYA_communism_in_one_country:0 "Communism in One Country"
CYA_communism_in_one_country_desc:0 "Our ideology has no fertile ground to spread elsewhere, for the current moment. We should focus on nourishing our own nation exclusively. This does not mean we are blind to the plight of foreign workers, but it is merely a pragmatic choice."
CYA_standard_of_living:0 "Raise the Standard of Living"
CYA_standard_of_living_desc:0 "Our attempts to bring Cyanolisia to a modern age have been successful thus far, but the revolution is far from completed. The people deserve amenities so that they can live happy, working lives instead of languishing in despair."
CYA_proletarian_factories:0 "Proletarian Factories"
CYA_proletarian_factories_desc:0 "A socialist country cannot have its people be unemployed. We shall enact a program of mass industrialisation to give each and every Cyanolisian citizen a workplace they can proudly call their own."
CYA_the_best_defense:0 "The Best Defense"
CYA_the_best_defense_desc:0 "Any foolish invader would be deeply surprised to see that the people of Cyanolisia fight hard. No longer are we a disjointed nation, fractured by old grudges, but an united one, ready to meet whatever threat with heads high! Cyanolisia lives on, and it shall never fall!"
CYA_commie_mit_outback:0 "Opening up the Outback"
CYA_commie_mit_outback_desc:0 "With the two races working together to establish a socialist utopia, the formerly hostile outback can now be properly developed and exploited for resources. This does not mean, however, that there aren't still minotaur remnants who seek to cause trouble. They will have to be dealt with eventually, but Cyanolisia isn't a state consisting of just coastal cities anymore."
CYA_commie_mit_indigenes:0 "Reconciliation with the Indigenes"
CYA_commie_mit_indigenes_desc:0 "Despite having fought together to bring forth the new order, relations with the minotaurs have remained strained, to say it lightly. Efforts will be placed into finding common ground, to put an end to decades of rivalry and hostility."
CYA_comission_on_minotaurian_affairs:0 "Kommission für die Minotaurische Gebiete"

CYA_stamp_out_dissent_desc:0 "Spies, traitors, and perhaps the worst of all, communists, are crawling over our cities. Even the military is not safe from them!

CYA_control_the_press:0 "Gag the Press"
CYA_control_the_press_desc:0 "We cannot let the newspapers and other media write what they want. Sooner or later, they'll leak crucial information of our plans and who knows what will happen once the hornheads find out. The press must write only what we tell them to write."

CYA_coma_battalions_desc:0 "Instead of serving in our regular forces, the K.f.d.M.G. will allowed to form their separate units and battalions. Their dedicated mindset will enable them to perform where the fight is the harshest. True Cyanolisians as they are, they will never die!"
CYA_the_generalissimo:0 "The Generalissimo"
CYA_the_generalissimo_desc:0 "General Yohn Vogelbeck is right. Despite their political deadlock, the minotaurs will unite against us once they hear of our looming invasion plans. If we cannot control our own countryside, how will we control an entire island full of hostile bulls? The only rational choice is to fortify and await the storm."
CYA_requisition_firearms:0 "Requisition Firearms"

CYA_fortify_thymiashafen_desc:0 "Thymíaustadt is our most valuable city and the centre of almost every industry and production in our nation. Should we lose it, the war will be lost already - and the minotaurs know this. It shall receive the strongest defences we can muster."
CYA_army_intelligence_division:0 "The Army Intelligence Division"
CYA_army_intelligence_division_desc:0 "Obtaining any information on the minotaurs' plans is already difficult due to the dividing sea. A special group will be formed to obtain the required intelligence, as well as root out any spies and dissenters that are undoubtedly crawling everywhere."
CYA_protected_supply_lines:0 "Protected Supply Lines"
CYA_protected_supply_lines_desc:0 "The army marches on its supplies, this is known, but our logistical department is non-existant. Not to mention that indigenous minotaurs occasionally strike at our convoys, making the task of resupply quite harder than it already is. Regardless, we shall focus our efforts in improving the supply situation."
CYA_police_the_outback:0 "Patrols in the Outback"
CYA_police_the_outback_desc:0 "Controlling the bull hordes is certainly not an option. What we can do, however, is increase our presence in areas that contain vital mineral riches, and force captured minotaurs to work for us. Should they refuse, we got a quick solution to that as well."

CYA_military_training_exercises_in_the_outback_desc:0 "While our troops are keeping in good shape and know how to operate their weaponry, they still require some actual combat experience.

CYA_the_kustenschutzwand:0 "Build the Küstenschutzwand"
CYA_the_kustenschutzwand_desc:0 "This is our most ambitious project yet - the Küstenschutzwand.

CYA_admiral:0 "The Admiral"
CYA_admiral_desc:0 "Scile von Sprache, our most senior admiral, has the right idea on dealing with the minotaur threat.

CYA_requisition_landing_craft:0 "Requisition Landing Craft"
CYA_requisition_landing_craft_desc:0 "To carry our forces towards Asterion, we require far more convoys than we currently own. Our first priority shall be obtaining a sufficient number of them, as well as producing landing craft for the beach assault."
CYA_naval_intelligence_service:0 "Form the Naval Intelligence Office"
CYA_naval_intelligence_service_desc:0 "Ships require intelligence on their foes' positions at all times, which is why we require a dedicated group of analysts to gather and process all this information, to give our seagriffons the best chance of success."
CYA_train_the_troops:0 "Train the Troops"
CYA_train_the_troops_desc:0 "As we find ourselves in a pressing need for more soldiers, a realisation has come to us that military training takes longer than it should. It will have to be reformed and stripped only to the essentials, in order to have a large standing army."
CYA_naval_auxiliary_patrol:0 "Form the Naval Auxiliary Patrol"
CYA_naval_auxiliary_patrol_desc:0 "The bulls are known to set off on raids, targetting the trade ships sailing towards our coastal cities. As our naval forces are currently stretched thin, we've decided to form additional patrols drafted from volunteers, to keep an eye on the sea."

CYA_what_to_do_with_minotauria_desc:0 "By the Gods, we have been victorious! Against all odds our forces have struck the bulls a decisive blow, and they've sued for peace quickly afterward.

CYA_the_black_book:0 "The Black Book"
CYA_the_black_book_desc:0 "Even with our victory secured, control over the Asterion Archipelago is tenuous at best. We suspect various political leaders, rabble-rousers and other dissidents are inciting the population towards a revolt. It would be best to ensure they quietly disappear. The message will be clear and obvious."
CYA_deepen_tribal_conflicts:0 "Intensify Tribal Conflicts"
CYA_deepen_tribal_conflicts_desc:0 "The defeat in the war has shattered the bulls' sense of unity. Now they spend more time fighting each other, blaming their opponents for the loss.

CYA_demilitarise_minotauria:0 "Demilitarise the Asterion Archipelago"
CYA_demilitarise_minotauria_desc:0 "To ensure the bulls do not rise up against us in any foreseeable time, their society will be forcefully transitioned to a peaceful one.

CYA_fortify_western_border:0 "Fortify the Western Border"
CYA_fortify_western_border_desc:0 "The Sicamese alliance with the bulls is a well known fact in international diplomacy. Rational concerns have been raised about the possibility of them working together against us. While we cannot completely prevent the chance of a two front war, we can dissuade them from launching major assaults by raising a series of fortifications on the western border."
CYA_economic_shock_therapy:0 "Economic Shock Therapy"
CYA_economic_shock_therapy_desc:0 "With our existance secured, we shall now look into resolving the economical matters. While Cyanolisia certainly can't be called poor or illiterate, we have not taken advantage of our position. Establish trading routes across the entire southern Griffonia! This will give us the means to propel ourselves forward."
CYA_look_to_the_empire:0 "Look to The Empire"

CYA_decree_for_civic_service:0 "The Decree for Civic Service"
CYA_decree_for_civic_service_desc:0 "The war has greatly depleted our forces, and attempting to raise an another army would invoke displeasure from the populace. Instead, we shall attempt a different approach: send a call for capable griffons to assist in rebuilding our fair city. There are plenty of underappreciated tasks to do, such as road repair and patrols."
CYA_decree_for_market_liberalisation:0 "The Decree for Market Liberalisation"
CYA_decree_for_market_liberalisation_desc:0 "Trade is the lifeblood of any nation, especially for a small city state like ourselves. We cannot afford to hoard resources, it must all go! There are plenty of willing buyers and with the increased income we can divert some of it towards solving our social inequalities."
CYA_decree_urban_consolidation:0 "The Decree for Urban Consolidation"
CYA_decree_urban_consolidation_desc:0 "We have precious little space to work with, and these rows upon rows of slums and poorly constructed neighbourhoods do not reflect well on Neu Thymíau's splendour. We symphatise with the burdened and impoverished, but the cold hard truth is that we need this space more than they do."
CYA_develop_outskirts:0 "Develop the New Thymíau Outskirts"
CYA_develop_outskirts_desc:0 "The desire for safety has led to our city having almost no space left for the construction of new buildings. With the minotaur threat removed, the city of Neu Thymíau can now naturally expand beyond its old city walls, and the populace doesn't have to live in squalor anymore."
CYA_lands_acquisition_act:0 "The Land Acquisition Act"
CYA_lands_acquisition_act_desc:0 "Thymíaustadt - now Neu Thymíau - was a very old city. The usage of land was not optimal; city planning in the early days was non-existant, and as a result the city centre is a warren of labyrinthian hovels full of poor people. We will knock them down using bulldozers and tanks, and in their place we will build grand boulevards with elegant buildings and well-manicured parks."
CYA_walled_city:0 "The Minotaurian Walled City"
CYA_walled_city_desc:0 "Griffons and minotaurs are simply incapable of living together. Both are stubborn species who never let go of their grudges, resulting in untold destruction and misery. However, our new status means we cannot simply expel the minotaurs. Instead, we have a simple but elegant solution."
CYA_decree_bureaucratic_rehabilitation:0 "The Decree for Bureaucratic Rehabilitation"
CYA_decree_bureaucratic_rehabilitation_desc:0 "Left alone for long enough, and the bureaucrats begin to grow indolent and complacent with their responsibilities. New times require new officials, and our administration requires plenty of fresh faces for our rebirth."
CYA_dissolve_coastal_governates:0 "Dissolve the Coastal Governates"
CYA_dissolve_coastal_governates_desc:0 "The governate system is simply obsolete now - they cannot rule cities that we do not control anymore. Their functions will be abolished and these griffons will find work elsewhere."
CYA_focus_inwards:0 "Introspektionsrichtlinie"
CYA_focus_inwards_desc:0 "Now that we are free of the outback's burden, we no longer have to spend time and money trying to control it. All efforts shall go exclusively to New Thymíau, the greatest city on the southern coastline."

CYA_by_griffons_for_griffons_desc:0 "The minotaur majority has become an extreme minority, as they have emigrated in mass numbers from Thymíashafen, rejoining their homeland. This suits us perfectly, and Cyanolisia can now properly call itself a griffon nation."
CYA_decree_for_reformed_governance:0 "The Decree for Reformed Governance"
CYA_decree_for_reformed_governance_desc:0 "We have done much recently in reforming Cyanolisian governance, but now the Countess wishes to enact a final step in consolidating her rule over New Thymíau. She will present her ideas tomorrow to the Neundrachen Chamber."
CYA_new_economic_minister:0 "The New Minister for Economics"
CYA_new_economic_minister_desc:0 "Cyanolisia's economy has been a confusing bind for a long time. Between unpredictable profit margins, losses from minotaur raids, the need to heavily invest in our defence the industry, it was difficult for everygriff to manage it. With the peace restored, our gracious Lady Taillow has proposed forming a dedicated ministry for the economy, that will finally bring some order to our income."
CYA_new_industrial_minister:0 "The New Minister for Industry"
CYA_new_industrial_minister_desc:0 "Our industrial capabilities will require a full reconstruction given the present situation. And what better way to achieve this than replacing the industrial managers with new griffons with bright ideas? They've be given a greater leeway in controlling the production, as well."
CYA_new_war_minister:0 "The New Minister for War"
CYA_new_war_minister_desc:0 "The war cabinet has led our nation to a disastrous defeat and as such they must be sacked. We require military leaders whose sense of strategy isn't stagnant and rooted in the past. Only this way can we prevent a second defeat."
CYA_new_foreign_minister:0 "The New Minister for Foreign Affairs"
CYA_new_foreign_minister_desc:0 "Our foreign policy requires a different approach befitting our status of a free city.

CYA_new_economic_minister2:0 "Farmland Expropriations"
CYA_new_economic_minister2_desc:0 "The new proposed development plan requires us to obtain several plots of farmland situated outside of the cities.

From our coastal cities, we have ventured outwards into the vast ocean in our ships - to trade, to explore, to plunder. Now we pursue a different kind of expansion, by creating land from where the sea once was.

CYA_raze_the_dockside_slums_desc:0 "The numerous hovels and shacks that are everywhere on our piers are a haven for smugglers, criminals and other undesirable elements of society.

CYA_reconvene_neundrachen_chamber_desc:0 "When Thymíau was still an independent trading city, the Neundrachen Chamber served as the parliament of the city-state, staffed by delegates elected by popular vote both from the city's districts and beyond.

CYA_direct_rule_from_evosmoshafen:0 "Direct Rule from Thymíaustadt"
CYA_direct_rule_from_evosmoshafen_desc:0 "The County is ruled from the capital by a hierarchy of military governors reporting directly to the Countess' Court. The governorates only have a nominal degree of local autonomy, and decrees from the Court are to be followed without question."
CYA_minotaurian_outback:0 "The Hostile Outback"
CYA_minotaurian_outback_desc:0 "The inland regions of the County are lawless, ruled over by a myriad of minotaurian warlords, insurrectionists, and bandits. Only in the well-defended coastal towns are the County's griffon minority safe. Attempts to build infrastructure and make use of the natural resources in the so-called Outback are regularly stymied by fierce raids by indigene partisans. The County's minotaurian majority resent the rule of the Imperial Court, and make no secret of it."
CYA_opened_outback:0 "The Minotaurs' Outback"
CYA_opened_outback_desc:0 "Following the Communists' successful victory in the uprising against the military junta, the Cyanolisian Outback, once hostile to any griffon who strayed from the safety of the coastal towns, are now starting to be opened up to reclaimation and development. With a substantial majority of the Minotaurian indigenes supporters of the Communist cause, cadres from Thymíaustadt are now able to build infrastructure and make use of the natural resources in the Outback without fear of coming under attack by indigene partisans. With the opening up of the Outback comes the institutionalisation of the indigenes' legal and environmental rights to their lands and the resources within, affording them legally-recognised and unquestionable, if somewhat lessened from before, autonomy over the Outback. We can now also rely on the support of the Minotaurian indigenes in the event of an invasion, since they will now fiercely defend their hard-earned rightful lands alongside their Griffon brethren from the towns."
CYA_minotaurian_indigenes:0 "Minotaur Indigenes"
CYA_minotaurian_indigenes_desc:0 "When the lands now comprising the County of Cyanolisia were stripped from the Asterion Republic and reorganised into an Imperial colony, the indigenous Minotaurian population was forcibly displaced from the lucrative coastal trading towns into the undeveloped outback. The result was that outside of the coastal towns the population was Minotaurian-majority. Barred from entering any of the towns but given free rein over the wild interior, these indigenes scattered, forming various tribes and factions. The outback is a hostile place to any Griffon, as the authority of the Imperial court ends at the borders of the coastal towns. Governance is hard because of the suppressed yet unruly Minotaurian population, which outnumbers the total Griffon population ten to one. Many Minotaurs in Cyanolisia long for reunion with the mother country across the channel."

thatcher_birb_desc:0 "Countess Taillow Sumpfkiel has ruled Cyanolisia for the previous three decades. Initially idealistic and believing that the minotaur problem could be resolved with dialogue and reconciliation, the unyielding hostility from the secessionist minotaurs, as well as several assassination attempts have shattered her peaceful nature. Hardened and firm, she seeks to protect her griffons at any cost, and yearns for the day when her people will no longer live with a siege mentality. Countess Taillow holds no love for the authoritarian measures she uses to control the coastal cities, but recognises the necessity of bold measures in these difficult times."

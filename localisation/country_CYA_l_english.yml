CYA_consolidate_our_forces:0 "Consolidate Our Forces"
CYA_consolidate_our_forces_desc:0 "Our army is in disarray, the command hierarchy is a confusing bind, we cannot even agree on the style of our uniforms. It is time to bring order in our land forces. Painful, but necessary."
CYA_army1:0 "Army Reforms"
CYA_army1_desc:0 "Modern militaries require contemporary structures, and ours is quite outdated. Let us begin our reforms from the basics."
CYA_officer_cadre:0 "Officer Cadres"
CYA_officer_cadre_desc:0 "Our forces could benefit from new leadership in the field. Our officers have grown content and stagnant in their role, leading to decreased army performance. Let us reverse this trend."
CYA_mil_radio:0 "Military Radio"
CYA_mil_radio_desc:0 "The radio, as an invention, is rather widespread in Cyanolisia, brought by Wingbardian traders, but we do not have the means to produce our own. The military is interested in adopting it for their own use, but we must first reverse engineer the technology to fulfill our requirements, particularly in encrypting radio signal frequencies."
CYA_army_sailor_brigades:0 "Form Sailor Brigades"
CYA_army_sailor_brigades_desc:0 "In the past, the Imperial Southern Fleet had its home port in our capital of Thymíaustadt. Today, the Southern Fleet is long gone, although many of its erstwhile sailors still remain in our country. They are dispossessed yet able-bodied and well-trained griffons, and so we will arm them and organise them into landbound brigades to serve and fight once more."
CYA_logistics_company:0 "Military Logistics"
CYA_logistics_company_desc:0 "An army marches on its supplies, and with the situation in Cyanolisia, foraging cannot be relied on at all to provide necessary items for the troops. A dedicated logistics squadron will be formed to support our brave soldiers."
CYA_officers:0 "Army Command Office"
CYA_officers_desc:0 "There is more to leading than pointing your weapon at the enemy - our officers and generals must have a centralised commander centre where they can plan our operations in the theater. While it is true that a plan never survives first contact with the enemy, we can at least try to minimise the danger for our regular troops."
CYA_army6:0 "The Army Construction Corps"
CYA_army6_desc:0 "In times of war, we cannot completely rely on the civilian sector to provide timely construction, repairs and everything else our forces might require in their operations. Thus we have seen fit to raise a specialised corps to handle this sort of predicament." 
CYA_army7:0 "Knightly Heavy Infantry"
CYA_army7_desc:0 "The gallant spirit of the knights has never died out! With proper training and equipment, they shall be able to handle any obstacle. It just might be a suitable replacement until we can get our armoured vehicle production up and going."
CYA_army8:0 "Panzer Modernisation"
CYA_army8_desc:0 "Initial results of the armoured vehicle program has been very promising, and we are confident that should it receive some dedicated funding, we can create a model that will be ahead of its time. Cyanolisia needs every advantage it can get."
CYA_support_comp:0 "Military Engineers"
CYA_support_comp_desc:0 "In order to effectively wage war, we require pioneers and sappers. These brave griffons will build fortifications, clear areas from danger, and erect temporary bridges. The physical environment will be theirs to shape."
CYA_inf_guns:0 "Small-Arms Modernisation"
CYA_inf_guns_desc:0 "The troops have been complaining about having to use outdated firearms for a while now. We've heard their concerns, and we shall commence designing a more contemporary rifle for the rank and file soldier."
CYA_artillery_stuff:0 "Artillery Modernisation"
CYA_artillery_stuff_desc:0 "A routine inspection of our ordnance supply has revealed various faults at claw, such as defective pieces, usage of outdated models such as demi-cannons, and lacklustre training on the soldiers' part. It would be best to make our current priority bringing order to the artillery battalions."
CYA_army_motorization:0 "Army Motorisation"
CYA_army_motorization_desc:0 "Efforts shall be placed into improving the mobility of our armed forces. But to commence with our plans, we first require a reliable vehicle to carry troops and supplies."
CYA_mountain_guns:0 "Mountain Guns"
CYA_mountain_guns_desc:0 "Artillery wins wars, but deploying it on hills and mountains is a fool's task. Efforts must be placed into designing more managable, smaller ordnance pieces that can handle rough terrain without sacrificing their accuracy and firepower."
CYA_armor_workshops:0 "Armour Workshops"
CYA_armor_workshops_desc:0 "Although the industry required to mass produce armoured vehicles does not exist in Cyanolisia currently, it would still be wise to place a portion of our budget into researching tank designs, so that we do not remain too far behind other, more modern nations."
CYA_magical_weapons:0 "Magical Weapons"
CYA_magical_weapons_desc:0 "Reports of firearms that utilise magical crystals as ammunition have been dismissed as a delusion, but a recent breakthrough from our scientists have made them a reality. Although they currently suffer from reliability issues, we are confident that we can improve them until they completely replace regular rifles."
CYA_modernizing_army:0 "Army Doctrinal Modernisation"
CYA_modernizing_army_desc:0 "The outdated doctrine we inherited from the Griffonian Empire is no longer optimal for our strategy. Our theorists will begin researching and experimenting with new tactics and options."
CYA_army_laboratories:0 "The Army Research Division"
CYA_army_laboratories_desc:0 "The armed forces require specialised research facilities and equipment that simply cannot be trusted to the civilian sector. With issues like bureaucracy and funding out of the way, these scientists will focus exclusively on improving our armies in every possible aspect."
CYA_pilot_training:0 "Army Pilot Training"
CYA_pilot_training_desc:0 "Operating an airplane is a strenuous task, and we must ensure every recruit for the airforce receives proper training so that their performance in the field is not diminished. The number of volunteers for the new air branch is vast, but only the best will be admitted."
CYA_build_air_bases:0 "Build Airstrips"
CYA_build_air_bases_desc:0 "Planes require an extensive amount of space to operate properly. Fortunately, we own plenty of empty fields which are more than suitable for the construction for hangars and airfields."
CYA_air_support_effort:0 "CAS Effort"
CYA_air_support_effort_desc:0 "Airplanes bring a new dimension to warfare, giving us options that were previously unavailable. For example, a sturdy fortification or trench can now be assaulted by aircraft carrying explosive payloads, saving many lives of the regular troops. Thus it is imperative that we develop these airplane designs as well, and put them into production."
CYA_fighter_effort:0 "Fighter Effort"
CYA_fighter_effort_desc:0 "Theorists are suggesting that the most important battles will not be waged on land, but rather in the air. The one to control the skies will control the outcome of the war, and if we wish to be the victors, we require a dedicated fighter plane to maintain dominance of the skies."
CYA_air_auxiliary:0 "Air Auxiliaries"
CYA_air_auxiliary_desc:0 "Griffons are at their natural in the sky - thus it is only fitting we make use of our talents to improve the performance of our airplanes. Better training, more air bases, there is plenty of room to expand our options."
CYA_bomber_effort:0 "Bomber Effort"
CYA_bomber_effort_desc:0 "Once the control of the skies is secured, we can move in with the second wave of attack: bombers. These large, durable planes will carry a destructive payload, and they shall reduce any obstacle, be it bunkers, cities or even naval warships to flaming wreckage. This will secure our victory."
CYA_aviation_corps:0 "The Army Aviation Corps"
CYA_aviation_corps_desc:0 "With the growing progress of our air corps, we now find ourselves in need to create a dedicated training and housing facility for all our pilots. There, they will receive the best training we can afford, ensuring their skills stay sharp and chances of any accidents will be minimised."
CYA_rocket_science:0 "Rocket Science"
CYA_rocket_science_desc:0 "Jet engines and rockets are promising a new age in warfare. Although we can currently only produce experimental prototypes, with enough funding we can propel ourselves to the future and ahead of our rivals."


CYA_coastal_railway:0 "Build the Coastal Railway"
CYA_coastal_railway_desc:0 "The first step in furthering our meagre industrial base is to connect our coastal cities by a modern railway. Transportation of goods and griffons will become much safer and quicker, no longer troubled by the marauding bulls."
CYA_coastal_towns:0 "Develop the Coastal Towns"
CYA_coastal_towns_desc:0 "There is plenty of unused land available for construction of new factories, military bases or simply more homes for our people. We should purchase this land for our future projects."
CYA_manufactory:0 "Satellite Manufactories"
CYA_manufactory_desc:0 "The city of Thymíaustadt is our most prized jewel, certainly, but we cannot develop it exclusively at the expense of others. See to it that our other coastal cities of Salmarkt and Auropallieta receive funding for their new industrial designs as well."
CYA_arsenal:0 "The Tarmuth Arsenal"
CYA_arsenal_desc:0 "Cyanolisia lives and dies based on its firearms. For a long time, we could not produce new weaponry or even purchase from abroad. Now, however, we can correct that, and dedicated firearm factories in our industrial satellite of Tarmuth will ensure every soldier has their gun."
CYA_company:0 "Support the Horst Trading Company"
CYA_company_desc:0 "We have come to rely on a number of trading companies that have set up their base of operations in our prized cities. The largest and most profitable of these, the Horst Handelsunternehmen, can offer us just what we need, for some concessions and funding. We'd be wise to become their patron."
CYA_town_stuff:0 "Sponsor the Auropallieta Dockyards"
CYA_town_stuff_desc:0 "To protect our homeland from the hated minotaurs, we must expand our existing naval capabilities, so that we can construct more ships and screening vessels. This will come at the expense of other opportunities, but it is the grim reality."
CYA_town_stuff2:0 "Sponsor the Port of Salmarkt"
CYA_town_stuff2_desc:0 "Although Salmarkt has only recently been passed to our care, its location has been very profitable for our trading business. Nogriff can object towards having more money, and thus we shall expand the shipping capabilities of the Salmarkt port."
CYA_town_stuff3:0 "Horst Oil Refineries"
CYA_town_stuff3_desc:0 "The Horst Handelsunternehmen has come up with a yet another brilliant idea for solving our lack of strategic resources - synthetic oil and rubber refineries. By using only a small portion of the actual resource, we can ease the demand and produce decent replacements. All they ask in return is a plot of land and a cut of the profits."
CYA_industrialise_fragrantharbour:0 "Develop Thymíaushafen"
CYA_industrialise_fragrantharbour_desc:0 "The Thymíaustadt harbour could use an expansion. We have already located good areas to build new wharfs, piers and docks. We only need to start working."
CYA_steelworks:0 "The Thymíaustadt Steelworks"
CYA_steelworks_desc:0 "Steel is a vital resource for the production of almost everything we require, be it buildings or weapons. As such, it would be prudent to expand our existing steel mills into something that can produce an actual difference for the state."  
CYA_outback_oil:0 "Oil In the Outback"
CYA_outback_oil_desc:0 "The griffons are rightfully frightened of the outback, but we cannot completely ignore it. A rather bold surveyor has located oil deposits in the jungles of Cannabia, and its location is relatively easy to access and protect from the cow tribals. Every bit helps, certainly."
CYA_special_industry:0 "Cannabia Special Industries"
CYA_special_industry_desc:0 "Would you look at that. Following our success in securing the oil well, we have uncovered a deposit of rare magical crystals. While we currently do not have a practical use for it, we know plenty of others who do, and would pay a pretty coin for them. A factory will be opened to process this new resource, as well."
CYA_griffon_institute_of_science:0 "Naval Institute of Science"
CYA_griffon_institute_of_science_desc:0 "The researchers are promising great advancements, but their facilities and funding are insufficient for their grand designs. Given their previous successes, we see the merit in their plea. The results will quickly follow."
CYA_industrial_stuff:0 "Steelworks Expansion"
CYA_industrial_stuff_desc:0 "The new steelworks are already producing much, helping our efforts, but there is more we require than just plain steel. Additional plants for the processing of the more rare metals will be commissioned and built, both in our capital and its satellites of De Aguilar, Tarmuth, and Espelho Mar."
CYA_industrial_stuff2:0 "The Thymíau RADAR Tower"
CYA_industrial_stuff2_desc:0 "The splendid new invention called RADAR will change much in the future of warfare. After all, knowing where the enemy is at all times is an invaluable knowledge, and we should aim towards improving this technology."
CYA_modern_computation_machines:0 "Modern Computing Machines"
CYA_modern_computation_machines_desc:0 "The bright future lies within electronics, in these complicated machines that can replace the work of dozens. With these "computers" focusing on menial tasks, our research base is free to handle more pressing concerns, improving our knowledge at large."
CYA_industrial_stuff3:0 "Construction R&D"
CYA_industrial_stuff3_desc:0 "There is more to building a house or digging a mine than just raising support beams and ensuring the floor is even. Yes indeed, we shall aim towards combining our existing building methods with modern tools and vehicles. It will considerably improve our progress."
CYA_industrial_stuff4:0 "The Bright Future in Science"
CYA_industrial_stuff4_desc:0 "Despite our many difficulties in achieving progress, our hard work has paid off and now we reap the benefits. Our griffons are brighter and more productive by the day, and this is reflected in the increased amount of population capable of handling more demanding tasks. Three cheers for Cyanolisia!"


CYA_expand_capital_docks:0 "Expand the Thymíaustadt Docks"
CYA_expand_capital_docks_desc:0 "The Thymíaustadt piers are in a rather decrepit state. In order to restore the glory of the old Imperial Fleet, we must repair these docks and construct additional ones."
CYA_found_admiralty:0 "Reform the Admiralty Office"
CYA_found_admiralty_desc:0 "The ad hoc arrangements which managed our navy are no longer acceptable. We require a properly trained secretariat, which will consist of griffons who are knowledgeable in all matters naval, instead of admirals and officers too old to walk the quarterdeck. This will drastically improve our fleet's performance."
CYA_found_capital_shipyards:0 "Sponsor the Horst Shipyards"
CYA_found_capital_shipyards_desc:0 "The ever reliable Horst Handelsunternehmen has an another great offer for us: they'll build new shipyards in exchange for tax concessions. With our pressing need to rebuild the fleet, we can afford the smaller yearly tax income."
CYA_build_a_navy:0 "Rebuild Our Navy"
CYA_build_a_navy_desc:0 "With preparations completed, the actual work can now begin. The waves will be ruled by Cyanolisia once more! After the lengthy construction period, of course."
CYA_screening_effort:0 "Screening Ships Effort"
CYA_screening_effort_desc:0 "The smallest warship class, destroyers are excellent for scouting and hunting down submarines. Since it will take a considerable amount of time before we can build larger ships, it would be best to modernise our dated Imperial designs."
CYA_cruiser_effort:0 "Cruiser Effort"
CYA_cruiser_effort_desc:0 "With destroyers acting as our screening vessels, cruisers of both light and heavy variant can act as a stopgap before we can develop larger warships. They can supplement our patrol forces, as well."
CYA_raise_the_austernfischer:0 "§HRaise the Austernfischer§!"
CYA_raise_the_austernfischer_desc:0 "The flagship of the erstwhile Imperial Southern Fleet, the Austernfischer was sunk just off the shore of Thymíaushafen by a minotaurian bomb which blew a hole in its hull. This was years ago, when Asterion seceded. Today, with modern salvaging techniques at our disposal, we can attempt to refloat the sunken battlecruiser, which will make a fine addition to our fledging navy."
CYA_capital_ship_effort:0 "Capital Ships Effort"
CYA_capital_ship_effort_desc:0 "We finally have the means and funding to begin the construction of largest warships - but first we require a reliable design. Lessons learned from the Austernfischer's model will considerably aid in this endeavour."
CYA_submarine_effort:0 "Submarine Effort"
CYA_submarine_effort_desc:0 "Submarines are undoubtedly going to be the turning point in naval warfare. No ship, no matter how heavily armoured, will not be safe anymore. Our enemies' trade lanes will be under constant threat. All we require for this is a working model."
CYA_the_aeronaval_corps:0 "Form the Aeronaval Corps"
CYA_the_aeronaval_corps_desc:0 "The future of warfare clearly lies within beautiful coordination of carriers and adapted airplanes. We shall commence forming a corps specialising in this endeavour."
CYA_carrier_effort:0 "Carrier Effort"
CYA_carrier_effort_desc:0 "Some of our admirals believe warships are a dying breed in the new millennia, and that we should focus on converting our hulls to carry airplanes. They argue that should these carriers be well protected by screening vessels, they can damage enemy ships before they can retaliate, forcing them to retreat. We see wisdom in this thinking, and we shall focus on building our first carrier designs."
CYA_carrier_building_facility:0 "Carrier Construction Facilities"
CYA_carrier_building_facility_desc:0 "With our first carrier blueprint finalised and approved, we can commence construction. But first we require an expansion of dockyards - Thymíaustadt has room for an another pier. Additionally, rare metals will be imported to smoothen the construction of this new warship, so that we don't end up forced to use inferior replacements."
CYA_seaplane_effort:0 "Seaplane Designs"
CYA_seaplane_effort_desc:0 "Airplanes require vast modifications in order to be able to use carriers as a launching pad. Existing models will be experimented with until we can find a satisfactory balance of firepower, range and weight."
CYA_seebataillon:0 "Form Seebataillons"
CYA_seebataillon_desc:0 "Cyanolisia lives and thrives by its long coast. It can be said that the griffons here are quite familiar with the sea - and this is our logic behind forming the Seebataillons. A specialised force adapt in amphibious warfare, to lead the assault on the enemy's beaches."
CYA_naval_assault_effort:0 "Naval Assault Effort"
CYA_naval_assault_effort_desc:0 "Preparing a naval invasion is a difficult task - it requires extensive planning and coordination. We have identified the key faults in our planning, and we shall focus on correcting them. This ensures should we require to stage a naval assault, it will proceed much smoother and less good griffons will die."
CYA_torpedo_destroyers:0 "Torpedo Cruisers"
CYA_torpedo_destroyers_desc:0 "Torpedoes have proven themselves to be a very effective weapon, submarines and destroyers are rather fragile. This means that despite their armaments, they cannot guarantee a successful hit on an enemy ship. We've gathered our expert naval theorists to come up with a new warship design, that will exclusively carry a torpedo payload."
CYA_form_naval_paratroopers:0 "Form Naval Paratrooper Battalions"
CYA_form_naval_paratroopers_desc:0 "While sceptic minds regard the parachute as something that a griffon clearly does not require, we recognise that a soldier, no matter how fit and trained, cannot be expected to lumber heavy equipment while flying. Training specialised battalions in parachute operations will expand our tactical options on the field."


CYA_the_conference_at_evosmoshafen:0 "The Conference at Salmarkt"
CYA_the_conference_at_evosmoshafen_desc:0 "Stranded for decades in this hostile outback land, we have persevered. But it was not without difficulty. Vengeance driven beasts, the minotaurs threaten to overrun all we hold dear. The Countess has decided to hold a meeting with the highest ranking commanders in Salmarkt, in order to decide our future course of action."
CYA_the_group_of_twenty:0 "The Group of Twenty"
CYA_the_group_of_twenty_desc:0 "A group of officers within the Cyanolisian military has been dissatisfied with the nation's state for a long time. Despite the vast spectre of ideological differences between them, they've put aside their quarrels and agreed on one thing: the current regime must go, and a socialist utopia will rise from its ashes."
CYA_form_sailors_committees:0 "Form Sailor's Committees"
CYA_form_sailors_committees_desc:0 "It is imperative to secure the support of our seagriffons. Having the navy on our side could make all the difference should internal strife occur, but we might also be able to seize leadership without any blood spilled."
CYA_the_anarchists_and_equalists:0 "The Anarchists and Egalitarianists"
CYA_the_anarchists_and_equalists_desc:0 "While we all share the vision of a socialist Cyanolisia, there are multiple viewpoints on how it should be achieved. Some groups hold radically different positions compared to Equestrian socialism, and could disrupt our plot. On the other claw, we need every griffon for our cause. How should we proceed?"
CYA_radicalising_the_troops:0 "Radicalising the Troops"
CYA_radicalising_the_troops_desc:0 "It is known that the military has little love for the perpetual siege we are subjected towards in Cyanolisia, and we can use this to our advantage. However, we will only have enough time to convince one group - the officers or the common soldiers."
CYA_liasing_with_the_indigenes:0 "Liasing with the Indigenes"
CYA_liasing_with_the_indigenes_desc:0 "Some find it distasteful, but the native minotaurs could prove to be a valuable ally. One of our goals is to stop the needless hatred between the two species, and we shall approach the tribal leaders. Common ground can and will be found."
CYA_coordinating_with_the_cadres:0 "Coordinating With the Cadres"
CYA_coordinating_with_the_cadres_desc:0 "The majority of griffons in Cyanolisia inhabit our coastal cities, and they are having firstclaw experience of the oppression forced unto them by the capitalists. The workers are our natural ally in the revolution, but we could consider convincing the despised bourgeoisie - their influence could ensure a smooth transition."
CYA_roll_the_die:0 "Roll The Die"
CYA_roll_the_die_desc:0 "Words will not be enough to overthrow the current regime, this is certain. Only a violent revolution can ensure a proper beginning of a pure, socialist nation. Down with the Countess! Down with the tyranny!"
CYA_the_officers_putsch:0 "The Officers' Putsch"
CYA_the_officers_putsch_desc:0 "We are confident that we've achieved sufficient support for our cause. Countess Sumpfkiel will have no choice but to abdicate and leave the country once she sees the overwhelming strength of the revolution. Our demands will be presented at the next session of the Countess' court, set to occur in three days..."
CYA_our_finest_hour:0 "Our Finest Hour"
CYA_our_finest_hour_desc:0 "Our plot has resolved in the most remarkable manner and we now have control over Cyanolisia. Let the people celebrate, for a brighter age is to come! The first order of business is to determine how will the future of our new Cyanolisia resolve."
CYA_democratic_socialism:0 "The Neue Demokratische Sozialismuspartei"
CYA_democratic_socialism_desc:0 "The people have chosen the Neue Demokratische Sozialismuspartei to lead the nation. They promise equality without racism, prosperity without exploitation and liberty without oppression. Peace, bread and democracy for all, no matter the race or class!" ##thanks Horsie :wink:##
CYA_equalism:0 "The Radikale Gleichheitspartei"
CYA_equalism_desc:0 "The devastating civil war has divided our fragile nation once again. The egalitarianists and their anarchist allies have stepped up to assume control of the state, due to the lack of other capable, more moderate leaders. They have an unique goal for Cyanolisia in mind."
CYA_equal_rights_bill:0 "Equal Rights Bill"
CYA_equal_rights_bill_desc:0 "The first step in healing this nation is the introduction of the equal rights bill - from now on, every griffon, pony, minotaur, zebra - in short, everycreature will be equal, regardless of their occupation, living habitat or beliefs. That way, our society will begin mending itself."
CYA_abolish_private_ownership:0 "Abolish Private Ownership"
CYA_abolish_private_ownership_desc:0 "Ownership is a disease that will cause strife in our equal society. We need to ensure nocreature owns no more than the other. Whether in poverty or in prosperity, we all share the same burden, but our goal is the same as well."
CYA_land_redistribution:0 "Land Redistribution"
CYA_land_redistribution_desc:0 "The bourgeoisie have unjustly occupied vast swathes of land in order to fund their illicit, greedy schemes. These will be taken by the state, and redistributed to each according to their need."
CYA_communist_patriotism:0 "Revolutionary Patriotism"
CYA_communist_patriotism_desc:0 "Military service has been regarded as distasteful, if necessary, for a long time in Cyanolisia. This meant that volunteers were few and between, but now, the people are much more eager to join our armed forces. The decades old siege mentality has come to an end."
CYA_unions_in_politics:0 "Unions in Politics"
CYA_unions_in_politics_desc:0 "The unions, which protect the workers from exploitation, must have a say in the workings of the government. They will ensure that new laws and regulations are not made to the detriment of the proletariat."
CYA_mixed_species_brigades:0 "Mixed-Species Battalions"
CYA_mixed_species_brigades_desc:0 "The next step in achieving our equal society is by forming military units containing multiple species. This experiment has two goals - to see if combat performance remains optimal, and to convince the remainder of the army to slowly adopt this unit formation."
CYA_horizontalised_military_structure:0 "Horizontalised Military Structure"
CYA_horizontalised_military_structure_desc:0 "The armed forces shall march as one and fight as one - the strict hierarchy has only shackled the common soldier. Now freed from their chains, they shall fight with unmatched fervour."
CYA_equalist_society:0 "An Equal Society"
CYA_equalist_society_desc:0 "So many nations and societies across the world would be far off better if they adopted our way of thinking. It is the duty of every proud citizen of Cyanolisia to spread the virtues of equality!"
CYA_collectivisation:0 "Agrarian Collectivisation"
CYA_collectivisation_desc:0 "Farmland and other properties which produce food must be seized for the good of the state, so that we can reform the way of production according to our ideals. We expect that initially there will be a lack of food as the farmers adjust to new quotas and regulations, but the results will be more than promising."
CYA_military_commissars:0 "Military Commissars"
CYA_military_commissars_desc:0 "While it was the armed forces who liberated Cyanolisia, we believe it would be wise to keep an eye on them. Anti-revolutionary sentiment cannot be allowed to fester, and these valiant commissars will ensure ideological purity in the army, as well as inspire the troops to new heights of bravery."
CYA_the_means_of_production:0 "Seize the Means of Production"
CYA_the_means_of_production_desc:0 "The state requires all of its materials, industry, infrastructure to further its goal. No longer shall we sell our hard work to the foreign capitalists, who would extort us and never give their fair share."
CYA_miners_collectives:0 "Form Miners' Collectives"
CYA_miners_collectives_desc:0 "The miners are some of the most vulnerable classes in the nation. Working long hours in dangerous conditions for a miserly paycheck, exploited harshly by the capitalist oppressors. This changes now, and the ownership of the mines goes towards those who work in them. Productivity and morale will increase."
CYA_national_health_bureau:0 "Form the National Health Bureau"
CYA_national_health_bureau_desc:0 "Basic healthcare, provided by the state, is the right of every citizen. We must ensure this privilege becomes a reality for every Cyanolisian, regardless of their wealth or social standing. The humid climate of southern Griffonia is a breeding ground for sickness, after all."
CYA_free_education:0 "Free Education"
CYA_free_education_desc:0 "A literate citizen is a free citizen - and we must ensure everycreature receives basic education. The perfect opportunity to spread our values, as well."
CYA_intercommunalism:0 "Intercommunalism"
CYA_intercommunalism_desc:0 "With our affairs in order, the time has come to spread the values of socialism to our neighbours. The workers will rise, and we will not compromise! The oppressive feudal overlords must all go, into the annals of history where they belong, never to return!"
CYA_liberate_the_north:0 "Liberate the North"
CYA_liberate_the_north_desc:0 "The nations of the Evi Valley are being ruled by oppressive feudal monarchs and thieving thugs. Of particular note is the despised tyrant Kloseu, who is rumoured to have killed every communist supporter in Prywhen. They will be avenged! We must intervene to bring socialism to their lands." 
CYA_liberate_the_west:0 "Liberate the West"
CYA_liberate_the_west_desc:0 "Falcor and Sicameon languish in their underdeveloped, rural states. Their leaders promise progress, but they are liars, leeching off the work of the proletariat! We must march forth and free the workers. With every nation following our cause, the proletariat across the world will unite!"
CYA_into_the_world:0 "Into The World"
CYA_into_the_world_desc:0 "With our immediate neighbours flying proudly the red flag, our goal has been achieved. But there are still workers across the world, toiling and slaving away for a pittance, yearning to be released from their shackles! Let the world know Cyanolisia supports the liberation of the proletariat in every nation!"
CYA_communist_future:0 "A Communist Future"
CYA_communist_future_desc:0 "Cyanolisia has progressed greatly in the past few years. From a backwater County besieged by minotaurs, we became a proud nation free from its woes and exploiters. This is reflected in our literate, free citizenry, who are living happy and fulfilled lives. The future is here."
CYA_communism_in_one_country:0 "Communism in One Country"
CYA_communism_in_one_country_desc:0 "Our ideology has no fertile ground to spread elsewhere, for the current moment. We should focus on nourishing our own nation exclusively. This does not mean we are blind to the plight of foreign workers, but it is merely a pragmatic choice."
CYA_standard_of_living:0 "Raise the Standard of Living"
CYA_standard_of_living_desc:0 "Our attempts to bring Cyanolisia to a modern age have been successful thus far, but the revolution is far from completed. The people deserve amenities so that they can live happy, working lives instead of languishing in despair."
CYA_proletarian_factories:0 "Proletarian Factories"

CYA_commie_mit_outback:0 "Opening up the Outback"
CYA_commie_mit_outback_desc:0 "With the two races working together to establish a socialist utopia, the formerly hostile outback can now be properly developed and exploited for resources. This does not mean, however, that there aren't still minotaur remnants who seek to cause trouble.

CYA_commie_mit_indigenes:0 "Reconciliation with the Indigenes"
CYA_commie_mit_indigenes_desc:0 "Despite having fought together to bring forth the new order, relations with the minotaurs have remained strained, to say it lightly. Efforts will be placed into finding common ground, to put an end to decades of rivalry and hostility."

CYA_stamp_out_dissent_desc:0 "Spies, traitors, and perhaps the worst of all, communists, are crawling over our cities. Even the military is not safe from them!

CYA_control_the_press:0 "Gag the Press"
CYA_control_the_press_desc:0 "We cannot let the newspapers and other media write what they want. Sooner or later, they'll leak crucial information of our plans and who knows what will happen once the hornheads find out. The press must write only what we tell them to write."

CYA_the_generalissimo:0 "The Generalissimo"
CYA_the_generalissimo_desc:0 "General Yohn Vogelbeck is right. Despite their political deadlock, the minotaurs will unite against us once they hear of our looming invasion plans.

CYA_requisition_firearms:0 "Requisition Firearms"

CYA_protected_supply_lines:0 "Protected Supply Lines"
CYA_protected_supply_lines_desc:0 "The army marches on its supplies, this is known, but our logistical department is non-existant. Not to mention that indigenous minotaurs occasionally strike at our convoys, making the task of resupply quite harder than it already is. Regardless, we shall focus our efforts in improving the supply situation."
CYA_police_the_outback:0 "Patrols in the Outback"
CYA_police_the_outback_desc:0 "Controlling the bull hordes is certainly not an option. What we can do, however, is increase our presence in areas that contain vital mineral riches, and force captured minotaurs to work for us. Should they refuse, we got a quick solution to that as well."

CYA_military_training_exercises_in_the_outback_desc:0 "While our troops are keeping in good shape and know how to operate their weaponry, they still require some actual combat experience.

CYA_the_kustenschutzwand_desc:0 "This is our most ambitious project yet - the Küstenschutzwand.

CYA_admiral_desc:0 "Scile von Sprache, our most senior admiral, has the right idea on dealing with the minotaur threat.

CYA_train_the_troops:0 "Train the Troops"
CYA_train_the_troops_desc:0 "As we find ourselves in a pressing need for more soldiers, a realisation has come to us that military training takes longer than it should. It will have to be reformed and stripped only to the essentials, in order to have a large standing army."

CYA_the_black_book:0 "The Black Book"
CYA_the_black_book_desc:0 "Even with our victory secured, control over the Asterion Archipelago is tenuous at best.

The message will be clear and obvious."
CYA_deepen_tribal_conflicts:0 "Intensify Tribal Conflicts"
CYA_deepen_tribal_conflicts_desc:0 "The defeat in the war has shattered the bulls' sense of unity. Now they spend more time fighting each other, blaming their opponents for the loss.

CYA_demilitarise_minotauria_desc:0 "To ensure the bulls do not rise up against us in any foreseeable time, their society will be forcefully transitioned to a peaceful one.

CYA_fortify_western_border_desc:0 "The Sicamese alliance with the bulls is a well known fact in international diplomacy. Rational concerns have been raised about the possibility of them working together against us.

CYA_economic_shock_therapy:0 "Economic Shock Therapy"
CYA_economic_shock_therapy_desc:0 "With our existance secured, we shall now look into resolving the economical matters. While Cyanolisia certainly can't be called poor or illiterate, we have not taken advantage of our position. Establish trading routes across the entire southern Griffonia!

CYA_decree_for_civic_service:0 "The Decree for Civic Service"
CYA_decree_for_civic_service_desc:0 "The war has greatly depleted our forces, and attempting to raise an another army would invoke displeasure from the populace.

There are plenty of underappreciated tasks to do, such as road repair and patrols."
CYA_decree_for_market_liberalisation:0 "The Decree for Market Liberalisation"
CYA_decree_for_market_liberalisation_desc:0 "Trade is the lifeblood of any nation, especially for a small city state like ourselves. We cannot afford to hoard resources, it must all go!

CYA_decree_urban_consolidation_desc:0 "We have precious little space to work with, and these rows upon rows of slums and poorly constructed neighbourhoods do not reflect well on Neu Thymíau's splendour.

CYA_develop_outskirts:0 "Develop the New Thymíau Outskirts"
CYA_develop_outskirts_desc:0 "The desire for safety has led to our city having almost no space left for the construction of new buildings.

CYA_lands_acquisition_act:0 "The Land Acquisition Act"
CYA_lands_acquisition_act_desc:0 "Thymíaustadt - now Neu Thymíau - was a very old city. The usage of land was not optimal; city planning in the early days was non-existant, and as a result the city centre is a warren of labyrinthian hovels full of poor people. We will knock them down using bulldozers and tanks, and in their place we will build grand boulevards with elegant buildings and well-manicured parks."
CYA_walled_city:0 "The Minotaurian Walled City"
CYA_walled_city_desc:0 "Griffons and minotaurs are simply incapable of living together. Both are stubborn species who never let go of their grudges, resulting in untold destruction and misery.

CYA_decree_bureaucratic_rehabilitation:0 "The Decree for Bureaucratic Rehabilitation"

CYA_new_economic_minister:0 "The New Minister for Economics"
CYA_new_economic_minister_desc:0 "Cyanolisia's economy has been a confusing bind for a long time. Between unpredictable profit margins, losses from minotaur raids, the need to heavily invest in our defence the industry, it was difficult for everygriff to manage it. With the peace restored, our gracious Lady Taillow has proposed forming a dedicated ministry for the economy, that will finally bring some order to our income."
CYA_new_industrial_minister:0 "The New Minister for Industry"
CYA_new_industrial_minister_desc:0 "Our industrial capabilities will require a full reconstruction given the present situation.

CYA_new_war_minister:0 "The New Minister for War"
CYA_new_war_minister_desc:0 "The war cabinet has led our nation to a disastrous defeat and as such they must be sacked. We require military leaders whose sense of strategy isn't stagnant and rooted in the past. Only this way can we prevent a second defeat."
CYA_new_foreign_minister:0 "The New Minister for Foreign Affairs"
CYA_new_foreign_minister_desc:0 "Our foreign policy requires a different approach befitting our status of a free city.

CYA_open_door_immigration_policy_desc:0 "Let all who wish to settle in our fair city come: we shall accept all regardless of their race, wealth or religion. There are plenty of newly built housing waiting for these immigrants, who shall assist in expanding the splendour of New Thymíau."
CYA_new_economic_minister2:0 "Farmland Expropriations"
CYA_new_economic_minister2_desc:0 "The new proposed development plan requires us to obtain several plots of farmland situated outside of the cities.

CYA_horst_arms:0 "The Horst Armaments Firm"
CYA_horst_arms_desc:0 "The Horst Handelsunternehmen is proving themselves to be remarkably adaptable and flexible in providing for our needs. Although domestic firearm production is within quotas, and we can always import what we lack, Horst representatives believe we should make our own designs. We shall grant them the commission to produce firearms for our standing army, as long as their promises hold true."
CYA_griffon_jagers:0 "Griffon Jaegers"
CYA_griffon_jagers_desc:0 "Although the tradition of griffon knights has never gone out of style, we are considering adopting a more different approach to training our special forces.

CYA_welcome_pony_immigration:0 "Welcome Pony Immigration"
CYA_welcome_pony_immigration_desc:0 "Special attention should be given to attracting pony immigrants. Their unique, talent based approach to life should make up for the skilled personnel we lack, and their pacifist nature will ensure they will fight bravely for New Thymíau. All we need to give them is a warm, welcoming claw."
CYA_equine_military_units:0 "Form Pegasi Brigades"
CYA_equine_military_units_desc:0 "Many pony immigrants are fiercely protective of their new home, and have expressed a desire to serve in our forces. We can comfortably send most to fight alongside their griffon comrades, but pegasi would be best utilised as part of a special brigade to handle more sensitive objectives. They shall be quick as lightning!"
CYA_nt_polytech:0 "The University of New Thymíau"
CYA_nt_polytech_desc:0 "Previously we could not afford to make room for a higher centre of education, due to the situation. But now that our woes are behind us, we are free to give our best and brightest griffons the quality education they deserve, rather than sending them to foreign faculties, from which they often did not return. New Thymíau stands ready to benefit from these learned minds."
CYA_da_engineering_college:0 "The De Aguilar Polytechnic Institute"

CYA_banking_guild:0 "The Horst Banking Guild"
CYA_banking_guild_desc:0 "Some are wary of giving the Horst Handelsunternehmen so much influence and responsibilities, but they have truly proven themselves loyal to the state, and as far as we can tell, they are not secretly plotting to overthrow the regime. As such, we shall grant their request for establishing a banking guild. However, we will monitor their activities and ensure that they provide a honest service."
CYA_civil_guard:0 "Form the Civil Guard"
CYA_civil_guard_desc:0 "A dedicated force to keep our cities safe shall be formed.

CYA_expand_the_horst_oil_refineries:0 "Expand the Horst Oil Refineries"
CYA_expand_the_horst_oil_refineries_desc:0 "The Horst company has already began experimenting with their own oil and rubber processing plants, but their output is meagre and they consider them to be unprofitable.

CYA_tarmuth_rocket_site:0 "Construct the Tarmuth Rocket Base"
CYA_tarmuth_rocket_site_desc:0 "A prototype rocket-based weaponry has recently been discussed. Although expensive to produce and not quite optimal in performance, they provide a much safer method of unleashing devastation on our foes, rather than sending our brave griffons.

CYA_atomic_research_desc:0 "The Horst Trading Company has brought to our attention reports of successful channelings of nuclear energy. If we are to replicate such a feat and harness this so-called nuclear energy, we would gain access to a tremendous source of industrial and military power.

CYA_land_reclamation_in_the_sea:0 "Land Reclamation from the Sea"
CYA_land_reclamation_in_the_sea_desc:0 "It is undeniable that the Free State of New Thymíau is a maritime nation. From our coastal cities, we have ventured outwards into the vast ocean in our ships - to trade, to explore, to plunder. Now we pursue a different kind of expansion, by creating land from where the sea once was. All our coastal cities will benefit, gaining new seafront land on which to build as well as state-of-the-art maritime facilities."

CYA_raze_the_dockside_slums_desc:0 "The numerous hovels and shacks that are everywhere on our piers are a haven for smugglers, criminals and other undesirable elements of society. More importantly, these are taking up the space we wish to use for more honest dealings. However, we risk angering the slum dwellers if we were to so brazenly kick them out of their homes. A solution will have to be found."
CYA_tunnel_to_em:0 "Build the Espelho Mar Tunnel"
CYA_tunnel_to_em_desc:0 "Transport in and out of the island of Espelho Mar is possible only through a single bridge, built when the island was still Asterion territory.

CYA_reconvene_neundrachen_chamber_desc:0 "When Thymíau was still an independent trading city, the Neundrachen Chamber served as the parliament of the city-state, staffed by delegates elected by popular vote both from the city's districts and beyond. By reestablishing the Chamber, our government will hopefully garner more legitimacy for our nascent city-state. Of course, we will see to it that the Chamber wields no real power."

CYA_war_on_mit_desc:0 "The bulls have won the previous war, and it is clear they are not content with their victory.

CYA_agricultural_mechanisation:0 "Agricultural Mechanisation"
CYA_agricultural_mechanisation_desc:0 "New Thymíau relies heavily on foreign grain for sustenance.

CYA_propaganda_in_life_desc:0 "There is more to being a citizen of New Thymíau than paying your taxes.

CYA_de_aguilar_hydroponics_desc:0 "Plants that grow without being buried in soil might seem like an impossible idea to some, but in truth it is a viable method of agriculture.

CYA_claim_mit_islands:0 "Colonise the Outlying Islands"
CYA_claim_mit_islands_desc:0 "Many minor islands surround the Asterionese mainland, which are excellent locations for naval bases. Surveyors have reported mineral deposits which lay unexploited, and the small native minotaur population means we can settle griffons without too much tension."
CYA_island_resources:0 "Riches of the Outlying Islands"
CYA_island_resources_desc:0 "Having secured the control of the isles, we can now begin extracting their vast resource wealth. This shall complement our excavation projects on the Cyanolisian mainland, and allow us to expand our production in the future."

CYA_expand_snowtop_mines_desc:0 "While performing their usual duties, the miners at Snowtop have unearthed a particularly rich vein containing large amounts of precious crystals.

CYA_sicameon_war_reparations_desc:0 "In the short and brutal war, Sicameonese troops have inflicted great devastation on our land and killed many good Cyanolisian soldiers. It is only fair that we should demand reparations for the damages inflicted, to the last Idol of value. As long as we are not overly harsh on the amount, it will prevent them from developing their economy in the near time."
CYA_control_sic:0 "Sicameon's Reckoning"
CYA_control_sic_desc:0 "We should not be overly harsh on Sicameon. Their alliance with the minotaurs was only a matter of circumstances, and we cannot blame them for trying to defend themselves in this hostile world. A fair peace treaty is in order."

CYA_reclaim_coastal_cities:0 "Reclaim Our Coastal Towns"
CYA_reclaim_coastal_cities_desc:0 "In the short time they've held dominion over our prized coastal towns, minotaurs have done their hardest to spread their culture, at the expense of griffons who have lived there for decades. They've hailed us as liberators, and it won't take too much time and effort to restore Cyanolisian rulership. After we stamp out every trace of the minotaurs' influence, of course."
CYA_reintegrate_coastal_provinces:0 "Reintegrate the Northern Provinces"
CYA_reintegrate_coastal_provinces_desc:0 "The hostile outback issue shall be solved once and for all. Minotaurs will be displaced, insurrectionist cells will be rooted out, and finally, good griffons will settle the region. We shall be in complete control of our rightful land."
CYA_onwards_to_glory:0 "Onwards to Glory"
CYA_onwards_to_glory_desc:0 "The Creeper Mountains to our north used to a part of our county, before the Boreas-forsaken events of 978. Now, brutish bandits control the mountains, from which they launch their raids and cause great mayhem. It would be only proper as a civilised nation to put an end to these marauders and reclaim our final missing province."

CYA_direct_rule_from_evosmoshafen:0 "Direct Rule from Thymíaustadt"
CYA_direct_rule_from_evosmoshafen_desc:0 "The County is ruled from the capital by a hierarchy of military governors reporting directly to the Countess' Court. The governorates only have a nominal degree of local autonomy, and decrees from the Court are to be followed without question."
CYA_minotaurian_outback:0 "The Hostile Outback"
CYA_minotaurian_outback_desc:0 "The inland regions of the County are lawless, ruled over by a myriad of minotaur warlords, insurrectionists, and bandits. Only in the well-defended coastal towns are the County's griffon minority safe. Attempts to build infrastructure and make use of the natural resources in the so-called Outback are regularly stymied by fierce raids by indigene partisans. The County's minotaurian majority resent the rule of the Imperial Court, and make no secret of it."
CYA_opened_outback:0 "The Minotaurs' Outback"
CYA_opened_outback_desc:0 "Following the Communists' successful victory in the uprising against the military junta, the Cyanolisian Outback, once hostile to any griffon who strayed from the safety of the coastal towns, are now starting to be opened up to reclaimation and development. With a substantial majority of the minotaur indigenes being supporters of the Communist cause, cadres from Thymíaustadt are now able to build infrastructure and make use of the natural resources in the Outback without fear of coming under attack by indigene partisans. With the opening up of the Outback comes the institutionalisation of the indigenes' legal and environmental rights to their lands and the resources within, affording them legally-recognised and unquestionable, if somewhat lessened from before, autonomy over the Outback. We can now also rely on the support of the minotaur indigenes in the event of an invasion, since they will now fiercely defend their hard-earned rightful lands alongside their griffon brethren from the towns."

CYA_minotaurian_indigenes_desc:0 "When the lands now comprising the County of Cyanolisia were stripped from the Asterion Republic and reorganised into an Imperial colony, the indigenous minotaur population was forcibly displaced from the lucrative coastal trading towns into the undeveloped outback. The result was that outside of the coastal towns the population was minotaur-majority. Barred from entering any of the towns but given free rein over the wild interior, these indigenes scattered, forming various tribes and factions. The outback is a hostile place to any griffon, as the authority of the Imperial court ends at the borders of the coastal towns. Governance is hard because of the suppressed yet unruly Minotaurian population, which outnumbers the total griffon population ten to one. Many Minotaurs in Cyanolisia long for reunion with the mother country across the channel."

Hardened and firm, she seeks to protect her griffons at any cost, and yearns for the day when her people will no longer live with a siege mentality.

equality_memes_desc:0 "The tenets of equality stress that everycreature is equal before the law, between each other, and that nocreature has sway over another. The situation in Cyanolisia has necessitated that a council of elected leaders, ten griffons and ten minotaurs, have been chosen to lead the nation instead of placing control in a singular being. Their terms last for a year, upon which elections are held to determined who shall sit in the People's Council for the following year."
demsoc_birb_desc:0 "Out of the many who constituted the Group of Twenty, Alexandria Rinde was considered to be their informal leader, settling the disputes between the moderates and radicals. Her tenure in the armed forces only reinforced her existing belief that Cyanolisia was not under good leadership, nor could the current situation continue for too long. Inspired by the revolutionaries in Prywhen, she has begun her own plot. Following the success in the civil war, the former nobility has been exiled, an uncharacteristically merciful move, and the nation has entrusted the democratic socialist the leadership after the first free elections. Alexandria Rinde has made it her personal duty to ensure democracy, liberty and solidarity will prevail in Cyanolisia."

Our technological prowess has greatly improved since then, and we just might be able to refloat the warship. However, the cost of restoring the Austernfischer might be worth more than its tactical value, and there is no guarantee that the procedure will result in a success. It is up to [CYA.GetLeader] to determine whether raising the Austernfischer is a worthwhile endeavour."
cyan.1.a:0 "We must refloat this warship!"
cyan.1.b:0 "The funds would be better spent elsewhere."
cyan.2.t:0 "Raising The Austernfischer"
cyan.2.d:0 "The proposal to refloat the former warship has been approved by our leaders, and now the monumental task lies ahead of us. Salvage vessels have surrounded the location of the Austernfischer, lifting some of the ship's guns, so that the vessel will be lighter before attempting the refloat the actual hull itself. The plan is to increase the warship's buoyancy by emptying its ballast tanks, followed by patching the hole in the hull and pumping the water out. Afterward, every salvage vessel will assist in raising the ship, and attempt to tow it back to the nearest port. This is a delicate and complicated procedure, but we have our best griffons on the task."
cyan.2.a:0 "We await the results..."
cyan.3.t:0 "The Recommissioned Austernfischer"
cyan.3.d:0 "The old hull has been successfully towed to port, and our shipwrights have begun their work. The ship has suffered lighter damage than expected, seeing how it landed on seafloor bereft of rocks and other hard surfaces. Water has been drained from every section, rusted metal plates have been replaced, and every hole has been patched. Our knowledge of contemporary ship designs has allowed us to modernise the battlecruiser considerably, replacing the old coal-fired engine with oil-fired turbines, which allowed us to extensively upgrade the ship's armaments without slowing her down. Finally, the rebuilt Austernfischer was put through several test runs, and aside from minor mishaps, she is completely seaworthy again. The pride of the seas is ours once again! [CYA.GetLeader] is certain the Austernfischer will shift the balance on the high seas in our favour again, and once our shipbuilding industry is sufficiently developed, we can create entirely new ships from scratch based on its design."
cyan.3.a:0 "May she sail for years more!"
cyan.4.t:0 "The Austernfischer In Ruin!"
cyan.4.d:0 "The old hull has been successfully towed to port, and our shipwrights have begun their work. The ship has suffered lighter damage than expected, seeing how it landed on seafloor bereft of rocks and other hard surfaces. Water has been drained from every section, rusted metal plates have been replaced, and every hole has been patched. When the renovation came to the actual improvements, the process has hit a snag and got delayed considerably. The inexperience of our designers, who had little clue on how to retrofit an old hull with modern armaments, led to squabbling. Thus, the improvements were added without order or concern for viability, and in the end, during the ship's first voyage after refloating, has resulted in a critical engine failure which has sunk the Austernfischer again. [CYA.GetLeader] has expressed great discontent with the invested funds being thrown in the sea, literally, and have announced that the griffons responsible for the disaster will be sacked."
cyan.4.a:0 "Disappointment..."
cyan.5.t:0 "The Group Of Twenty"
cyan.5.d:0 "The Countess thinks her military to be unquestionably loyal to her, and that everyone harbours an innate hatred for minotaurs. She expects every soldier and officer to be ready to defend Cyanolisia against savage invaders to the death if need be.\n\nShe is wrong.\n\nFor several years now, high-ranking officers in the army have exchanged encrypted messages and met in shadowy corners of their barracks. They call themselves the Group of Twenty, and are a collection of leftist idealists, revolutionaries, minotaur sympathisers and simple mutineers. They share few values but have the same goal: The overthrow of the Countess and the reformation of Cyanolisia into a new, socialist nation.\n\nEncouraged by the Prywhen Civil War, which is turning in favour of the brave revolutionaries, they are now finally preparing to make a move. They know death may await them, but are willing to risk everything if it means the bloody conflict between griffons and minotaurs may finally end."
cyan.5.a:0 "Cyanolisia will be free!"
cyan.6.t:0 "Swaying The Army"
cyan.6.d:0 "We, the Group of Twenty, already have some influence within the armed forces. Our forces are already secretly rallying in preparation for the revolution, but it is clear that they would not be enough against the Countess' corrupt regime. However, it is clear that most of the soldiers do not fight out of love for their rulers, but rather for the bread on their tables. If we were to approach the dissatisfied troops and convince them of a better world should our plot succeed, this would tip the scales of balance in our side. Alternatively, we can attempt to convince the commissioned officers to support our cause, although that wouldn't guarantee the rank-and-file following suit. Time is of the essence, and we must decide quickly."
cyan.6.a:0 "Persuading the officers would be easier."
cyan.6.b:0 "Appeal to the troops, promise them better conditions."
cyan.7.t:0 "Convincing The Minotaurs"
cyan.7.d:0 "Alone, our movement is a minority compared to the military regime, and as such, we have little chance of succeeding in our plot. However, the native minotaurs could be convinced to support our cause. Decades of warfare has led to interracial relationships being highly strained, and the thus the minotaurs do not trust us. All is not lost yet, however, and careful diplomacy can lead to a mutual, if somewhat uneasy alliance. Shall we approach our potential supporters with pledges of racial equality should our revolution succeed, or give them a stake in the nation's control, securing the backing of their fighters?"
cyan.7.a:0 "Our future must be bereft of infighting."
cyan.7.b:0 "We need every fighter we can get."
cyan.8.t:0 "Support Within The Griffon Populace"
cyan.8.d:0 "It is quite clear that the populace is suffering under the oppressive bourgeois regime, as they are forced to toil endlessly to support the war effort. As such, quality of life is quite low, and most griffons are forced to work in double shifts or even two jobs to sustain themselves. One of the primary reasons why we have conceived our plot is to end the suffering the common folk is put through! Thus it is natural that we should draw our support from the proletariat, and arm them should the revolution become bloody. On the other claw, the small bourgeois middle class holds considerable influence within the cities. Convincing them could make our takeover much smoother, although some of our hardliner members would consider it to be betraying the ideas of socialism. A choice must be made."
cyan.8.a:0 "The bourgeois can be influenced."
cyan.8.b:0 "The proletariat is our natural ally."
cyan.9.t:0 "Civil War Erupts!"
cyan.9.d:0 "Enough preparation! Now is the time for action. The Countess' illegitimate and despotic rule shall come to an end, and we will not hesitate to use violence to subdue her bootlicking supporters. We hope that this last eruption of conflict will at last bring peace to our bleeding homeland, and that griffons and minotaurs may yet reconcile and learn to live together. But for that to be possible, we must first crush the oppressors and win the conflict."
cyan.9.a:0 "Onwards, comrades!"
cyan.10.t:0 "Overthrowing The Regime"
cyan.10.d:0 "No more senseless war and violence! Peace must return to Cyanolisia at last, and we must to everything we can to avoid a yet another gruesome conflict on our soil. Our support in the military has grown so large that we are confident they will stand by our side as we demand the Countess and her loyal lackeys to abdicate and leave the country. Some among our ranks warned that we may be mistaken, and that a civil war may be inevitable, but it is better to try and resolve this without bloodshed."
cyan.10.a:0 "The Countess gives in!"
cyan.10.b:0 "They were right..."
cyan.11.t:0 "Civil War Erupts!"
cyan.11.d:0 "The leading officers among us presented an ultimatum to the Countess while our soldiers attempted to occupy all governmental buildings in Thymíaustadt. Unfortunately, the Countess kept delaying the signing of the ultimatum and our troops faced surprisingly stiff resistance... as if they knew the coup was about to take place. Someone had leaked our plot to the enemy, and gave them ample time to prepare! Our officers ultimately had to flee the building as the Countess' reinforcements arrived and her bodyguards opened fire, with some of our brave comrades perishing. The entire country is thrown into confusion as messages are sent, with both revolutionaries and reactionaries taking up arms to annihilate each other."
cyan.11.a:0 "If we cannot avoid bloodshed, let us embrace it."
cyan.12.t:0 "Egalitarianists Seize Power!"
cyan.12.d:0 "Nogriff wanted a war, the transition of power could have been peaceful. But the extremists have forced the matter, leaving no choice for the remainder of the socialist alliance to follow them or be killed. Still, the war was won at a great cost: with most of the moderate leaders killed in action, the egalitarianists with their anarchist allies have seized control of the state. After subduing what remained of the resistance, both of the former County and within their own ranks, they are now hoping to create a grand new nation free of its previous trappings."
cyan.12.a:0 "There is much work to be done..."
cyan.13.t:0 "Democratic Socialist Party Elected!"
cyan.13.d:0 "As expected, the democratic socialists have won the elections which they themselves had prepared. Their relatively moderate policies were seen as far more reasonable by the common people, and many were enamoured with their promises of democracy and liberty, which no one in Cyanolisia had tasted for centuries. Especially the minotaurs support them, as they wish to experience the Asterionese liberty which their distant ancestors had once enjoyed."
cyan.13.a:0 "Democracy, solidarity, liberty!"
cyan.14.t:0 "The Radical Movements"
cyan.14.d:0 "The dream of a socialist Cyanolisia is within every revolutionary's heart, but in order to bring change, we must all stand together as one against the oppressive military regime. Unfortunately, like any other insurrectionist movement, there are many minor cliques who do not follow the majority's thought.\n\nThe egalitarianists are a radical group whose belief in centered around the belief that everycreature is equal to one another, no matter the race. An ideology that surfaced in Cyanolisia only recently, its devotees are often fanatical in their goal. Perhaps some of their less radical ideas of societal equality could be used, should our revolution succeed.\n\nOn the other claw, the anarchists are a fringe, yet surprisingly popular movement that seeks to abolish the state and the hierarchies that follow it. Its members are often confused for nihilistic delinquents, but their goals and manifesto are quite in-depth and they do have a solid vision on how would their vision of a society perform.\n\nThe Group of Twenty is divided in whether these peripheral parties could be integrated in the plot to overthrow the current rulers. While it is undoubtedly true that we require every willing griffon for the fight, they could become a liability with their uncompromising thoughts should our revolution succeed. This issue must be solved with haste."
cyan.14.a:0 "Marginalise these extremists!"
cyan.14.b:0 "Surely, we can find common ground."
cyan.15.t:0 "The Salmarkt Conference"
cyan.15.d:0 "Countess Taillow Sumpfkiel has summoned the high generals and admirals of the Cyanolisian military to the Salmarkt governor's coastal mansion. Seated at the head of the table, the weary Countess regarded her commanders with a steely gaze, and began speaking:\n\n"My good gentlegriffs. For decades, we have held against the minotaur threat, making little progress or headway against the insurrectionists lodged in our countryside. Across the channel, the Asterionese are at the brink of solving their political deadlock, and look poised to strike at any moment. We require a definite strategy for the upcoming storm, lest we all end up in a noose. I am open to suggestions." Murmurs were exchanged between the commanders until Lord Admiral Sprache stood up.\n\n"Countess Sumpfkiel. The Asterionese unity is but an illusion made by the bulls to strike fear into our hearts and minds. They will unite eventually, no doubt, but we must strike the archipelago, and launch the most glorious invasion Cyanolisia has ever seen. I have prepared an extensive plan for the operations required for this task." This was not what the Countess expected from the cautious admiral. But he seemed very confident and bold in his idea. Before she could issue a response, an old general rose up and laid his retort:\n\n"Be quiet, you fool. Do you really think the bulls in the outback would just sit idly while we invade their homeland?", general Vogelbeck said with contempt. His medal covered chest and scarred face told much of his bravery in the field. "The only viable plan is to hunker down in the bunkers. It would be far more safer and give us a chance against the bovine horde. This is my stance, and nothing can convince me to deviate from it."\nIt fell upon the Countess to choose the course of action. Both griffons undoubtedly had a solid idea in mind, and yet making the right choice was never straightforward. She wished her late husband was here to give her counsel. After minutes of deliberation, Countess Sumpfkiel proclaimed:"
cyan.15.a:0 ""Admiral Sprache's idea is risky, but doable.""
cyan.15.b:0 ""I am in favour of General Vogelbeck's plan.""
cyan.16.t:0 "The Rights Of Our Minotaur Friends"
cyan.16.d:0 "It is clear that without our minotaur allies, the revolution would have never succeeded. Now that we have stabilised the nation and introduced our preliminary reforms, it is time to pay good on our promises and grant minotaurs the rights they deserve. Following the spirit of equality, minotaurs shall be equal to griffons in all respects by the law. They shall not be discriminated, snubbed over for employment, or have their voting rights obstructed. Although it is known that Cyanolisia might not be ready yet for such radical changes, we cannot compromise on the tenets of equality. They complain now, but in a few years all past grudges will be forgotten, and everycreature will live happily together."
cyan.16.a:0 "Equality makes us strong."
cyan.17.t:0 "The Rights Of Our Minotaur Friends"
cyan.17.d:0 "It is clear that without our minotaur allies, the revolution would have never succeeded. Now that we have stabilised the nation and introduced our preliminary reforms, it is time to pay good on our promises and grant minotaurs the rights they deserve. We have given them the rights of ownership, voting and military service, but to our dismay, we have encountered stiff resistance from the griffon citizens and party members as we did such. Memories of the past are still fresh in the griffons' minds, and they do not trust them fully yet. As we cannot risk offending our minotaur friends, lest they renege on us, we are forced to enact a compromise: griffons and minotaurs shall be equal, but separate. We hope this will minimise any incidents in the near future, until the public sentiment is on our side again."
cyan.17.a:0 "Shameful, but necessary."
cyan.18.t:0 "The Navy Defects!"
cyan.18.d:0 "After the civil war began, the navy had retreated to the isle of Espelho Mar and declared themselves neutral. At first, we assumed they reneged on their promise and planned to flee to a foreign nation or even join a pirate flotilla, but in just a few days, they have declared themselves in support of our revolution. The crew has been slightly diminished, as everygriff presumably did not wish to follow our cause, but the warships are still seaworthy and will make a difference in this civil war."
cyan.18.a:0 "Onward to victory!"
cyan.19.t:0 "Administration Of The Occupied Asterionese Archipelago"
cyan.19.d:0 "Following our most glorious victory over the minotaurs, the question has arisen over the future of the Asterionese archipelago. Although we have annexed some of the smaller outlying islands where the native population is minuscule, attempting to do such with the main islands would undoubtedly result in a bloody revolt down the line. It was always known, the minotaurs despise us to the very end and will always resist our rulership. As such, bold and harsh measures will have to be instated to quell any thoughts of rebellion. Our options are either to set up a military administration, or allowing collaborationist minotaurs to form their government which will be overseen by us. The choice is in the claws of [CYA.GetLeader]."
cyan.19.a:0 ""I prefer the idea of a military occupation, the bulls cannot be trusted.""
cyan.19.b:0 ""The collaborators can earn their worth by proving their loyalty.""
cyan.20.t:0 "A Case For Freedom"
cyan.20.d:0 "Today's session of Imperial Court was particularly crowded, for Countess Sumpfkiel had a grand idea to share. All of the coastal governors were invited, and so were each and every high ranked general and admiral. The assembled griffons were quite curious to find out the reason behind these summons, as the Countess did them very rarely. They chatted amongst themselves, until their leader called for order and began her speech.\n\n"Gentlegriffons. In recent times we have made great progress against the issues that plague fair Cyanolisia. Our cities are the shining jewels of the south. Our forces are trained and ready. Even the outback has been contained, for the time being. Has Cyanolisia not proven itself to be a worthy nation in its own right? Why should we continue to pay respects to a distant, uncaring overlord when they have done nothing for us? Cyanolisia should be a free state! Who stands with me on the matter?"\n\nCareful looks were exchanged between the seated griffons. By all respects, Cyanolisia has been an independent state since 978, yet everygriffon had a vague hope that some day, the gentle grasp of the Fatherland would return to the south. The artistic masterpiece depicting Grover the First crossing the Creeper Mountains, resting on the far wall, certainly left that impression in them. The silence was broken when Admiral Sprache stood up and loudly proclaimed his support for an independent Cyanolisia, which was quickly followed by the rest. Countess Sumpfkiel could only lean back on her throne and smile at the success of her scheme."
cyan.20.a:0 "Cyanolisia shall be free!"
cyan.21.t:0 "Declaration Of Independence"
cyan.21.d:0 "With the support gathered from the military commanders, the Countess moved swiftly to put her dream of independence to reality. She has given the order to remove everything resembling the old rule: statues and monuments to Emperors were removed, a distinct Cyanolisian identity would be promoted as the highest virtue, and what little token tributes to the fatherland that still existed have been discontinued. The only issue left now is to decide how would the nation be administered in the future. Should the County of old be preserved, or should a new way of governance be promoted as the correct way? This is the question that has occupied Countess Taillow's mind for the past few days."
cyan.21.a:0 "Cyanolisia shouldn't change too much."
cyan.21.b:0 "A free nation needs a fresh coat of paint."
cyan.22.t:0 "Preservation Of The Status Quo"
cyan.22.d:0 "In the end, the Countess has decided not to try experimenting with the nation's rulership. She argues that given the situation in southern Griffonia, a strong, uncontested leadership is necessary to weather the turbulent times. Only this time, Cyanolisia will stand on her own merits, and shall never again be some distant despot's fiefdom. Our fate is in our own claws now. "
cyan.22.a:0 "Countess Taillow is certainly an effective leader."
cyan.23.t:0 "The Southern Jewels"
cyan.23.d:0 "The coastal cities' governors were most intrigued when they saw with their own eyes the Imperial Court's most recent decree. Following the declaration of independence, many were curious how would the Countess proceed, given Cyanolisia's state. She has acknowledged the state in which we are in, and thus reformed the County in what she calls a League of Southern Cities. In essence, the current strict regime will be loosened and decentralised, giving the coastal cities more leeway with their budgets. Although Taillow Sumpfkiel will still be our leader, she hopes that this new arrangement will further improve our shining cities by the sea and usher in a new age of maritime expansion. We are certain our trade income will steadily grow as a result!"
cyan.23.a:0 "We live and die by the sea."
cyan.25.t:0 "[CYA.GetName] Sues For Peace!"
cyan.25.d:0 "The war for the reclamation of our rightful land has been proceeding at a steady pace. We have taken several coastal cities, which are acting as our forward bases for further deployment of more minotaur soldiers. We are at the cusp of complete victory.\n\nSuch would be the case, if it were not for emissaries arriving in our main command centre on the occupied mainland. For all their training and determination, the Cyanolisians do not have enough griffons to contest our onslaught, and as a result have been reduced to grovelling for peace. They are prepared to withdraw all claims and soldiers from our rightful territory, except their heavily fortified capital of Thymíaustadt.\n\nThe generals have relayed this peace offer to [MIT.GetLeader], who will deliberate with his cabinet on the matter."
cyan.25.a:0 "Let them have peace, for now. We'll come for the remainder later."

cyan.26.t:0 "The Treaty Of Salmarkt"
cyan.26.d:0 "Our diplomats have returned with positive news, for a change. The minotaurs have agreed to the stipulations of our peace treaty, and a ceasefire has been established. As agreed upon, all territory outside of the 200 kilometre radius from Thymíaustadt will be surrendered to the minotaurs, a minor indemnity will be paid, and minotaurs will be allowed to freely travel within our remaining land. It is our hope that from now on, peace will prevail. The Countess will travel tomorrow to Salmarkt to sign the peace treaty with an official representative of the Asterionese government."
cyan.26.a:0 "We may yet see an another dawn."
cyan.27.t:0 "Minotaurs Refuse Peace Treaty!"
cyan.27.d:0 "Grim news has arrived today. Despite our diplomats' silvers tongues and promises of generous reparations, [MIT.GetLeader] has laughed at our offer of peace, saying that the war will continue until every last minotaur has been liberated from our rule. We are forced to fight until the bitter end."
cyan.27.a:0 "Harden the fortifications. We are going down with honour."
cyan.28.t:0 "A Change In Course"
cyan.28.d:0 "Immediately after returning from signing the peace treaty, the now former Countess Sumpfkiel has made a grand proclamation to the remaining citizens of Cyanolisia. All newspapers were required to print her word, and distribute them for free across the cities of Thymíaustadt, De Aguilar, Tarmuth, Espelho Mar and others. Taillow Sumpfkiel has elaborated in great detail how the Cyanolisian remnants would be extensively reformed to a new style of governance, without the old issues curtailing progress. Mentions of the military's performance or whether the minotaurs would keep their word on the peace treaty were sparse and few, yet the griffons remained curious how would Taillow's plan proceed, and whether her visions had a standing in reality."
cyan.28.a:0 "A new nation arises, free of the old burdens."
cyan.29.t:0 "Bureaucratic Restructuring"
cyan.29.d:0 "Following the proclamation of the Free City, the former Countess has announced a series of reforms intended to remove the bureaucratic bloat that has plagued the former County for years. Although most of the red tape could have been bypassed by the previous Court's decrees, it is becoming increasingly clear that relying on the existing hierarchies will only bring issues in the future. In the following weeks, entire departments and bureaus will be closed down, its workers laid off, and the administration will be more streamlined to suit the will of Taillow Sumpfkiel."
cyan.29.a:0 "A necessary solution."
cyan.30.t:0 "Urban Consolidation"
cyan.30.d:0 "With the brief state of anarchy following the treaty of Salmarkt, many griffons have chosen not to continue living in the land now controlled by the Asterionese government. While some of them were able to secure themselves a new habitat and employment, most were not that fortunate and have ended dwelling in ramshackle houses and derelict neighbourhoods. These slums are painting a poor picture of Thymíaustadt, which is why the former Countess has ordered them to be razed. Upon the ashes of the past, grand boulevards and manicured parks will arise, giving the weary people something to be proud of in their everyday lives. As for the dispossessed griffons, they will be moved to a temporary location until they can resolve the troubles plaguing their existence."
cyan.30.a:0 "It's for the greater good."
cyan.31.t:0 "The New Cyanolisia"
cyan.31.d:0 "The past weeks have been a blur for the citizens of Thymíaustadt, De Aguilar, Tarmuth and Espelho Mar. The many reforms and changes enacted by Taillow Sumpfkiel have left the former county a completely different nation compared to before. Although tensions with the minotaurs remain high, most were relieved that the threat of war is over. The erstwhile Countess had a few more select ameliorations in mind, however.\n\nEverything that reminded the people of the old County has been changed; it was no longer Thymíaustadt, it is now New Thymíau. Taillow has shed her late husband's name and took upon the mantle of von Liváni, an ancient noble house from the Imperial Heartlands, from which all rulers of Cyanolisia came from. Monuments to the old times has been removed, streets have been renamed, and anygriff who protested against these drastic changes found themselves under intense scrutiny. The populace have been roused with promises of prosperity and wealth, which will be obtained by extensively focusing on maritime trade. "
cyan.31.a:0 "Great times are ahead of us."
cyan.32.t:0 "Segregation Of The Minotaur Minority"
cyan.32.d:0 "The official terms of the peace treaty stipulated that passage of minotaurs was completely free within the territory of the Free City. Reality has been more contentious than that. Minotaurs who have attempted to settle within Thymíaustadt, whether as residents, merchants or part time workers have met little more than scorn and contempt. Over time, this has escalated in physical confrontations, and it was becoming increasingly clear that a new arrangement would have to be made.\n\nThe erstwhile Countess has met with her cabinet and proposed a solution: a decommissioned fort on the edges of the city limits would be repurposed into a exclusion zone for the minotaur residents. Within its tall walls, they will be free to conduct their business without harassment or plunder. Although not all will be happy to be forced to live in conditions of squalor, many more will be pleased to live in peace."
cyan.32.a:0 "The two races cannot coexist together."
cyan.33.t:0 "Development Of The New Thymíau Ports"
cyan.33.d:0 "As a Free City focused on maritime trade, the expansion of our dockyards and wharves is our highest priority. Unfortunately, an extensive array of slums and shacks, inhabited by griffons of seedy character, obstructs our plans for advancement. New Thymíau's magistrates would love to simply throw out the beggars and seize their housing, but [CYA.GetLeader] fears that there might be a reprisal if the griffons are not properly compensated. After the last time we've sequestered the dwellings of the unfortunates, the common folk has become increasingly resistant to any further encroaching of their rights. What shall be our choice in the matter?"
cyan.33.a:0 "Compensate the griffons, fairly."
cyan.33.b:0 "What rights? Throw them out."
cyan.34.t:0 "The Debate On Eminent Domain"
cyan.34.d:0 "The new cabinet has proposed a development plan of previously unmatched size and opportunity, which will certainly bring us to an industrial golden age. However, the project requires more land than the government currently owns. A solution has been proposed to simply deprive farmers of their property, specifically the ones who are not producing sufficient amount of grain. A debate has been on how much should the farmers be compensated for their land, if at all, but [CYA.GetLeader] has suggested that the proposal can be scaled down, to avoid any disturbance of the common folk. What is our decision on this dispute?"
cyan.34.a:0 "Give them a pittance, to quell their dissatisfaction."

cyan.35.t:0 "Protests Arise Over The Parliament Restoration"
cyan.35.d:0 "In the days before the fall, the Neundrachen Chamber served as an intermediary between the Cyanolisian citizens and their rulers. Although it seemed like a democratic institution, it merely had an advisory role, as the most notable and influential citizens were elected to relay the people's will. However, it was abrogated once martial law was instituted.\n\nThus, the citizenry stirred when [CYA.GetLeader] announced she would reconvene the Chamber, only to be met with disappointment when no actual elections occurred. Instead, the seats were filled with Taillow's claw picked griffons, New Thymíau's wealthiest bankers and industrialists. As such, a large crowd has gathered outside of the parliament building, protesting against the exclusion of common griffons and the increasingly autocratic attitude from [CYA.GetLeader]. Despite the various ideologies that permeated the protesters, their voice was united: "Neundrachen for all!". The protests continued for days without relenting.\n\nLady Taillow was prepared to accept some of the more moderately minded griffons to the Chamber, but her closest advisors suggested a more forceful approach to the matter. How would this crisis be resolved?"
cyan.35.a:0 "Accept the moderates to the Chamber."

cyan.40.t:0 "The Resurgent Threat"
cyan.40.d:0 "Many griffons have remained suspicious of the minotaurs, despite the extensive stipulations of the peace treaty, but for the most part, incidents have been very sporadic and it seemed that peace would prevail. Life in New Thymíau has been quiet and uneventful, with griffons quickly adapting to the reformed state's ideals.\n\n[CYA.GetLeader] had other ideas in mind, however.\n\nThe rhetoric from the Liváni Mansion has slowly changed in the past weeks. No longer was a policy of neutral cooperation with the minotaurs propagated; instead Lady Taillow spent much of her time in the Neundrachen Chamber speaking of the looming threat from [MIT.GetName]. It was not enough for them to take our entire country, she claimed, and they would be very soon at the gates of New Thymíau looking to finish what they started. Most griffons had little reason to believe her warmongering speeches, until a series of negative events transpired.\n\nBorder patrols gone missing, supposed minotaur invasion plans exposed by the Freistaat Press, trade deals being cancelled for no apparent reason. The public demeanour quickly shifted to a nervous one, as the citizens have begun clamouring for their leaders and armed forces to protect their shining city from the minotaurs. War would be inevitable, it was clear to most."
cyan.40.a:0 "They will not beat us again!"
cyan.41.t:0 "Dealing With Dissent"
cyan.41.d:0 "It is clear to any ruler, no matter how just and fair their policies are, that they will suffer from dissenting opinions. From revolutionaries seeking to cast down the natural order, to ordinary folk complaining about taxes, there is no golden medium, and the burden of leadership is an everlasting chore.\n\nIt is no different in the Free City of New Thymíau. The rule of [CYA.GetLeader] has been contested from the very beginning, either by a moderate opposition holding weekly protests in the town squares, or the secret underground insurgents of varying extreme ideologies. Before we can proceed with some of our more grander plans, we must root out the dissenters lest they cause a crisis in the most unfortunate time.\n\nThe question remains whom to strike at. The liberal opposition could be easily dealt with trumped up charges and an extended prison sentence, but many of them are affiliated with the Horst Trading Company, and they are one of our most important supporters. It would be certainly migraine inducing to try explaining to them why are we imprisoning their important employees and clients. On the other claw, we have been tracking the underground movements for several months now, and we can confirm with certainty the location of their hideout. The only question is, how far will the violence spread once these radicals find out they're being culled.\n\nThe choice of a ruler is never straightforward."
cyan.41.a:0 "Find the extremists and dispose of them."
cyan.41.b:0 "Deal with the liberals; we can explain to the Horst Company."
cyan.42.t:0 "Sicameon's Peace with Honour"
cyan.42.d:0 "We have no real quarrel with Sicameon, this is a fact, but their alliance with the minotaurs have made them a part of our reckoning. Still, we shouldn't place overly harsh terms in the peace treaty. It will only cause them to grow revanchist and furious, and our aim is to pacify the region for the foreseeable future. Thus, we will control Sicameon as a loose protectorate, set up a minor indemnity for them to repay, and we will take the Snowtop Mountain chain from them. We are certain they will not protest too much at these terms, for they could have gone a lot worse, like their minotaur allies."
cyan.42.a:0 "Let us hope this will be the last of it."
cyan.49.t:0 "Prospero Burns"
cyan.49.d:0 "Out of all the cities, towns and villages of Asterion, the wealthy mountain-city of Prospero suffered by far the most. When the griffons descended upon the city, their artillery was assigned to level any symbolic targets such as the statue of Aster to break the spirit of the citizenry. Then they carried away all the mineral wealth they could find, taking it to the coast on trains and shipping it back to Thymíaustadt, while taking some of the gold and silver for themselves. While this took place, many soldiers preyed upon the civilian populace, robbing them bare and torturing them so they would reveal the locations of their treasures, then killing them once they had outlived their usefulness. Thousands upon thousands of minotaurs fled the city as their homes were set on fire by drunken looters. Others took up arms and tried to resist in vain. Officers tried to restore order but failed, with some of their own rank joining the common soldiers in the pillaging.\n\nThe vast vaults of knowledge in the city's many libraries were emptied of valuable tomes, with the rest being burned to ash. Any librarians who tried to resist were struck down mercilessly. Countless books were lost in the flames, and with them vanished much of Asterionese history and culture, which the griffons saw as worthless.\n\nAfter several days, nothing remained of Prospero but a smoking stony shell, bereft of the life, wisdom and wealth it had once held within."
cyan.49.a:0 "...Are we the baddies?"
cyanews.1.t:0 "The Free City Declared"
cyanews.1.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]On [GetMonth] [GetYear], the minotaurs of Asterion have reclaimed their ancient homeland on the shores of southern Griffonia. The beleagured remnants of the Imperial garrison could not hold against the onslaught, and the former County's minotaur population celebrates their liberation.\n\nThe war has come to an end as a result of Cyanolisian diplomats negotiating a peace treaty with [MIT.GetName]. They have renounced all claims on their former territory, except the area around Thymíaustadt. [CYA.GetLeader] has proclaimed a maritime free city over the remnants of Cyanolisia's territory."
cyanews.1.a:0 "Cyanolisians never die!"
cyanews.1.b:0 "We will be watching."
cyanews.1.c:0 "The minotaurs were merciful."
cyanews.2.t:0 "The Free City of Neu Thymíau"
cyanews.2.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]On [GetMonth] [GetYear], the minotaurs of Asterion have finally decided what to do with the only griffon-majority region in Cyanolisia: They have established a small autonomous region, with [CYA.GetLeader] at its helm.\n\nThe re-established Cyanolisian government has renounced all claims on their former territory, except the area around Thymíaustadt. The minotaurs expect the vassal state to serve them during war, but otherwise have promised to leave them be."
cyanews.2.a:0 "Cyanolisians never die!"

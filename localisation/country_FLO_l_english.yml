FLO_new_generals:0 "Advanced Military Training"
FLO_new_generals_desc:0 "Even as our troops are lacking in numbers, so too are the officers in our army. Singling out candidates within our army who have the capability to lead and promoting them should help with this issue; after they adapt to the role, that is."
FLO_army_training:0 "Fund the Officer Corps"

FLO_armor_focus:0 "The Future of Warfare"
FLO_armor_focus_desc:0 "Tanks are the future of warfare. From what we have seen in Equestria, metal behemoths that are able to take on many griffons or even ponies on their own. Inviting foreign experts to design their own for us would help both our publicity and our research."
FLO_armor_focus2:0 "Bet on the Tanks"
FLO_armor_focus2_desc:0 "We are too few in number to rely on infantry. However, some of our generals have proposed an entirely new form of warfare; massed tanks, punching through and cutting off enemy supplies. If we adopt this tactic, we will surely inflict far more casualties for far less of our own."
FLO_special_force:0 "Knights Are Outdated"
FLO_special_force_desc:0 "While the knights are highly traditional, they are also out of date. A newer, better alternative has been devised. Knights will become largely ceremonial, as this alternative is both cheaper and faster."

flowena.1.d:0 "The County of Flowena is the former commercial centre of the southern part of the Empire, but now, with the greedy Mayor Chocolate  in power, the county has been plunged into poverty, ignorance and disease. Will the county regain the status of its former trading city or be swept away by its stronger neighbours?"
flowena.1.a:0 "We can do this!"
flowena.2.t:0 "Fire!"
flowena.2.d:0 "This morning, the market on Cherry Square caught fire because of an abandoned bottle of incendiary mixture in one of the stalls, as a result, about 300 griffons were lost, fire brigades arrived 15 minutes after the start of the fire and just waited for the area  burn out together with the griffins. Thousands of griffins flocked to the main square and demanded an answer for such a crime. Mayor Chocolate refuses to comment on the matter, referring to his old credo. "In the square there are always some grumbling griffins, but I will always have my guards to disperse them.""
flowena.2.a:0 "..."
flowena.3.t:0 "Secret meeting of Generals"
flowena.3.d:0 "After the fire, at an army base in the dead of night, two generals convene. They had been talking about the situation in the City a lot, but the horrible fire has spurred them to action. No longer can this imbecile be allowed to ruin Flowena. Now the people can surely be convinced to help overthrow the Mayor."
flowena.3.a:0 "Mayor Chocolate is terrible leader! It's time to replace him!"
flowena.4.t:0 "On the way to great future"
flowena.4.d:0 "In order to accomplish the coup, we need more than planning. We need to actively rally our soldiers and citizens to our cause and also recruit soldiers for our army. We have already picked out volunteers from the ranks of the military to agitate against the mayor on the streets."
flowena.4.a:0 "Glory our great nation!"
flowena.5.t:0 "Step in the future"
flowena.5.d:0 "Today, at 4 o'clock in the morning, the First Guards Division named after Richter burst into the City Palace and, without a single drop of blood spilt, seized the mayor. The military has decided he will be hanged in the central square of Flowena for his crimes. Now we need to decide who will become the leader of our nation after the fact."

flowena.5.b:0 "Power in claws of the council of generals!"
flowena.6.t:0 "Lamentable news"

flowena.7.t:0 "Murderer found"
flowena.7.d:0 "Our detectives have found the griffon responsible for Astrid's death. He is now being interrogated in the cellars of the city barracks.

This is outrageous, we have to stand shoulder to shoulder in defence of our home!"
flowena.7.a:0 "Yes!"
flowena.8.t:0 "Trade offer from Flowena"
flowena.8.d:0 "We received an offer from Flowena with help of our trading partners from the Trade Federation. They want to purchase drawings of our modern equipment in exchange for the transfer of one of their advanced factories to the direct management of the Equestrian government."
flowena.8.a:0 "Good suggestion!"
flowena.8.b:0 "Who do they think they are!?"
flowena.9.t:0 "Request from brothers communists"
flowena.9.d:0 "We received a request from Flowena. Apparently they need new equipment to compete on an equal basis with the capitalist pigs that surround them. They need help to bring the World Revolution to the land of griffins!"
flowena.9.a:0 "Support the initiative!"
flowena.9.b:0 "We have more important matters to deal with."
flowena.10.t:0 "The Partisans"

flowena.13.a:0 "Good news!"
flowena.14.t:0 "The Flowenan claims"
flowena.14.d:0 "Apparently the old trading city of Flowena has found some old documents in their library. They show maps that say they have rightful dominion over our entire nation. This is absolutely preposterous, but the Flowenians insist on pressing the claims. What is our answer?"
flowena.14.a:0 "Stand down and submit."
flowena.14.b:0 "We will burn down that library."
flowena.15.t:0 "Revolution!"
flowena.15.d:0 "Urgent news! Mayor Chocolate was found dead. The doctors announced that he died of arsenic, which was added to his wine.\nAn emergency meeting of the city nobility was called. There the brother of Chocolate, Zygmund, along with a band of mercenaries  interrupted the council. He proclaimed himself a distant relative of Grover IV and said he was in his rights to take charge over the city of Flowena and its surrounding area."
flowena.15.a:0 "Stop right there, you criminal scum!"
flowena.16.t:0 "New reforms"
flowena.16.d:0 "On the first day of his usurpation of power, Zygmund began to legislate. His first decree was the voluntary and compulsory involvement of the poor in the construction of new manufacturies, where they will work in the future."
flowena.16.a:0 "This is not good!"
flowena.17.t:0 "Family archive"
flowena.17.d:0 "Zygmund's next step was to present the world his pedigree and with this he made claims on the land of Pomovarra. It was a  dangerous move and he was unsure  how the public would react."
flowena.17.a:0 "What a smart griffon."
flowena.17.b:0 "Make him stop!"
flowena.18.t:0 "A well cultured letter"
flowena.18.d:0 "An envoy has come from Flowena, he brings a letter from their new ruler. In eloquent prose the letter explains that he, a distant relative of the previous Emperor, has always had rightful dominion over our land. Since he understands that his claims might upset running investments from our elites, he has offered to pay all damages.\nThe sum of money he offers is truly fabulous. But do we really just sell off our land?"
flowena.18.a:0 "Why not?"
flowena.18.b:0 "Our land is not for sale!"
flowena.19.t:0 "They agree"
flowena.19.d:0 "[From.GetNameDef] accepted our letter and they have given over their land to us."
flowena.19.a:0 "Of course they have."

flowena.20.a:0 "A temporary setback."
flowena.21.t:0 "Strike!"
flowena.21.d:0 "Mayor, the fire situation seems to have escalated. A strike has begun in the town square! Crowds of the poor have joined together protesting our rule and many many townspeople sympathise with them. This could be bad..."
flowena.21.a:0 "Huh, what? A fire? To hell with them.."
flowena.22.t:0 "Deterioration of the situation"
flowena.22.d:0 "The situation is spiralling out of control! Not only the poor and the victims themselves, but even ordinary citizens have come out into the streets. We hear that some artisans are secretly arming the strikers! You must do something!"
flowena.22.a:0 "What do I care about this? Where is my wine?!"
flowena.23.t:0 "Revolution!"
flowena.23.d:0 "We have lost all control! In the suburbs and burned down areas, an uprising broke out under the leadership of Kaifas Lane, the founder of the Flowenian Communist party! With every minute, the ranks of the rebels are replenished by dozens of griffins. There are massive desertions from the army. What do we do?"
flowena.23.a:0 "This might be an issue..."
flowena.24.t:0 "From dust to dust..."
flowena.24.d:0 "The rebels slowly but surely advance to the mayor's palace. General Rosamund Richter was killed along with most of their soldiers in the defence of the shopping district. After this event General Astrit Koch elected to join the insurgents and has prepared her soldiers to storm the palace. Somehow the rebels got hold of a Stalliongrad artillery gun and they are aiming it at the mayor's office..."
flowena.24.a:0 "Proletarians of all countries, unite!"
flowena.25.t:0 "Red volunteers squads"
flowena.25.d:0 "Now that our revolution has been successful, we need to rally to its defence against anti-revolutionary elements. Today, a decree was issued named "On the creation of red guards". It will help to organise volunteer militias and to replenish the divisions of General Astrit Koch."
flowena.25.a:0 "Long live the Flowenian revolution!"
flowena.26.t:0 "The First plan"
flowena.26.d:0 "The public has calmed down and anti-revolutionary elements have fled the city or have been killed. We should start repairing the burned neighbourhoods and creating new jobs. We should take an example from Stalliongrad and its planned economy, such a system will help us quickly get out of the crisis situation."
flowena.26.a:0 "Five-year plan for three years!"
flowena.27.t:0 "The City-Fortress"
flowena.27.d:0 "Because of the growing tensions in the world and the threat of wars near our borders, we are concerned about the future of our honest proletarian city. Authoritative artisan Herman Gerhe proposed a plan in which we will be able to defend our city for decades and repel any attempt to attack our home."
flowena.27.a:0 "Our home - Our fortress."
flowena.28.t:0 "A Trade Union"
flowena.28.d:0 "Today, a diplomatic summit was attended by Flowena and the Trade Federation of Skyfall. It dealt with issues of cooperation and mutually beneficial trade.

flowena.28.a:0 "Money, money, money..."
flowena.29.t:0 "Constitution" #(Frozed)
flowena.29.d:0 "To protect our freedom and our trade, we have made a new constitution!"

flowena.30.t:0 "The Flowenan Question"
flowena.30.d:0 "Flowena already closely cooperates with Aquileia, and it is already difficult to say if they're independent or not. We need to formulate their new status."
flowena.30.a:0 "Let them remain an autonomous region."
flowena.30.b:0 "Take them into our state."
flowena.31.t:0 "The Flowenan Question"
flowena.31.d:0 "Flowena already closely cooperates with our Empire, and it is already difficult to say if they're independent or not. We need to stipulate their new rights."

flowena.31.b:0 "Appoint a Provincial Governor."
flowena.32.t:0 "Brothers from Flowena"
flowena.32.d:0 "We received an envoy from [FLO.GetName]. He told us about the successful revolution, and the shortage of rifles. He begged us for aid, but can we really spare something for our comrades?"
flowena.32.a:0 "Send equipment."
flowena.32.b:0 "Send volunteers."
flowena.32.c:0 "Refuse to help."
flowena.33.t:0 "Liberation army sends help!"
flowena.33.d:0 "The Eastern communists are sympathetic to us indeed and have sent us a great number of weapons with the hope that we will use them to export the revolution to other countries."
flowena.33.a:0 "Together for victory!"
flowena.34.t:0 "Liberation army refuses us to help!"
flowena.34.d:0 "Pryhwen's communists refused our call for aid and have returned our representative empty-clawed.."

flowena.38.t:0 "Party with Scientists"

flowena.39.t:0 "Construction stopped!"
flowena.39.d:0 "The heads of the construction department say that they don't have money to continue any of the projects. [Root.GetLeader] says the money were given a week ago."
flowena.39.a:0 "So where's the money?"
no_war_in_FLO:0 "Persuaded the mayor not to go to war"

flowena.42.t:0 "An unpleasant morning ..."
flowena.42.d:0 "The mayor of the city, known for his addiction to alcohol in his free time, did not hesitate to lean on spirits and at work, especially he had a weakness for the wonderful SkyFoll whiskey, known for its highest quality and indescribable taste. And so, one fine morning, when the sun's rays were just beginning to illuminate the tops of Floven’s houses, the mayor of Chokoladka had already drunk so much that he could barely stand on their paws, and the bottles with the rarest whiskey kept going one after another. Deciding to admire the sunrise, staggering from side to side, he went to the balcony, leaning on the slippery, shaky railing, which had not been repaired since the last drinking party of the alcoholic ruler. The amount of alcohol in his blood did not take long to wait and hurried to play a cruel joke with the gryphon - in an instant he fell down, unable to even spread his wings ... And it could have ended miserably if a young, ambitious griffin"
flowena.42.a:0 "... quickly grabbed the mayor and saved him."
flowena.42.b:0 "... took a step back."
flowena.43.t:0 "The trouble avoided"
flowena.43.d:0 "It is not known whether the gryphon rejoiced when he rescued the mayor or cursed himself in his heart that he didn’t allow such a careless and irresponsible ruler to die, but all his doubts were dispelled, it was only for the mayor to offer him a reward for such a marvelous salvation - a high position and honor as a general his army, from what the greedy griffin glory simply could not refuse. But was it worth it?"
flowena.43.a:0 "Was it worth it?"
flowena.44.t:0 "Situation is getting worse"
flowena.44.d:0 "Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, the mayor crashed on the pavement, but nevertheless, by some miracle, he still managed to survive, but with such injuries he was hardly able to continue his state activity, and therefore was immediately hospitalized, temporarily handing over the reins to the hands of the council."
flowena.44.a:0 "Was it worth it?"

flowena.45.t:0 "Flowenian Cooperation"
flowena.45.d:0 "Flowena has officially requested a guarantee to protect them from external threats. Additionally, they hope we will help develop their country. If we accept we will gain a lot of influence over the old Trade City, which used to be a gem in the crown of the old Empire."
flowena.45.a:0 "We graciously accept."
flowena.45.b:0 "We sadly must refuse."

flowena.46.t:0 "The Empire Agreed!"
flowena.46.d:0 "The Imperials have agreed to assist us!"
flowena.46.a:0 "Huzza!"

flowena.47.t:0 "The Empire refused!"
flowena.47.d:0 "The Imperials refused... We're doomed!"
flowena.47.a:0 "Drat."

flowena.48.t:0 "Flowenian Cooperation"
flowena.48.d:0 "Flowena has officially requested a guarantee to protect them from external threats. Additionally, they hope we will help develop their country. Flowena has traditionally been in the sphere of influence of Aquileia and it would suit us well to bring them into the fold once more."
flowena.48.a:0 "Make the arrangements."
flowena.48.b:0 "We have our own issues."

flowena.50.t:0 "The Aquileians Agreed!"

flowena.51.t:0 "Flowenian Cooperation"
flowena.51.d:0 "Flowena has officially requested a guarantee to protect them from external threats. Additionally, they hope we will help develop their country. Flowena has traditionally been a trading nation like us and as such it might suit us well to bring them into the fold."

flowena.51.b:0 "Not a good deal."

flowena.53.t:0 "The Federation Agreed!"

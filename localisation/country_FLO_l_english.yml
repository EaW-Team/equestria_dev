#Initial tree
FLO_new_year:0 "New Year's Resolution"
FLO_new_year_desc:0 "The patricians of Flowena knew something odd was happening with the mayor when he refused to attend their grand New Year's celebration, despite its lavish buffet.

However, he assured that he was feeling better than ever and promised he'd explain everything shortly after the next year had begun."
FLO_econ_reforms:0 "Boost The Economy!"

FLO_edu_reforms:0 "Expand Education!"
FLO_edu_reforms_desc:0 "The mayor's father and predecessor, Bronzino the Magnificent, introduced free public education to all citizens of Flowena, greatly increasing literacy rates even among the poor.

FLO_army_reforms:0 "Reform The Militia!"
FLO_army_reforms_desc:0 "Flowena has no standing army and relies on mercenaries and militiagriffs for defence, but it might not be enough to ensure the city's safety if war erupts. Our mayor will take swift and decisive action to make our militia truly mighty!"
FLO_construction_project:0 "A New Construction Project"
FLO_construction_project_desc:0 "The mayor wishes to invest the funds in the treasury into a new, huge construction project. There are two proposals, both of which could be greatly beneficial for our city."
FLO_negotiate_with_pomovarra:0 "Negotiate With Pomovarra"
FLO_negotiate_with_pomovarra_desc:0 "Our relations with Pomovarra are strained at best and they do not recognize our independence.

He is preparing for a personal visit across the border to "establish peace that will last a thousand years"."
FLO_general_strike:0 "General Strike!"

FLO_feast_in_the_plague:0 "Organize A Party"
FLO_feast_in_the_plague_desc:0 "Chocolat finally admits that he is not the best mayor, but he knows there is one thing he is good at: hosting parties. And that is exactly what he will do! A grand celebration to make everyone happy and calm."
FLO_quarantine:0 "Impose Quarantine"
FLO_quarantine_desc:0 "The mayor knows he has to redeem himself. The best way to accomplish this is by swiftly dealing with the Plague. And that can be done by first shutting the gates, because that's what's always done when plague comes."

FLO_cleanse_with_fire:0 "§RCleanse It With Fire§!"

FLO_expand_textile_mills:0 "Modernize Textile Mills"
FLO_expand_textile_mills_desc:0 "The textile industry is one of the largest sectors of our economy. Weaveries produce cloth that is then coloured with dyes made from flowers grown in our gardens.

FLO_expand_steel_foundries:0 "Expand Steel Foundries"

FLO_enter_weapon_market:0 "Enter The Arms Market"
FLO_enter_weapon_market_desc:0 "Not only is our city and its militia in need of weapons, but there is demand abroad as well. And when there is demand, there must be supply to meet it. We can profit greatly in these tumultuous times."
FLO_mechanization_of_industry:0 "Mechanization Of Industry"
FLO_mechanization_of_industry_desc:0 "While we have no lack of unskilled labourers to use for doing repetitive tasks, it cannot be denied that modern machines are far better at it than any living beings.

FLO_build_flowena_airport:0 "Construct The Flowena Airport"
FLO_build_flowena_airport_desc:0 "As planes see wider use and continually improve, we must expand our infrastructure to accomodate air travel. Thanks to our central location, we could profit from building a civilian airport which could also be used by our own airforce in times of war."

FLO_fortress_flowena:0 "Fortress Flowena"
FLO_fortress_flowena_desc:0 "Long ago, before Grover I's conquest, Flowena was the mightiest bastion in all of Griffonia, famed for its impregnable walls.

However, this time the soldiers will receive more than enough pay."
FLO_practical_enchantments:0 "Practical Applications Of Enchantments"
FLO_practical_enchantments_desc:0 "Magic might be good for tricks and such, but it also has economic potential. Enchantments can be used to boost production rates, improve quality of products and reveal new ways to use crystals for mathematical computation. It would therefore be wise to invest in education of magic and found a new faculty at our Business School."
FLO_negotiate_with_workers:0 "Negotiate With The Workers"
FLO_negotiate_with_workers_desc:0 "A happy worker is a productive worker who contributes willingly to the economy. Besides, conflict is expensive.

FLO_negative_income_tax:0 "Negative Income Tax"
FLO_negative_income_tax_desc:0 "Bruno has proposed a radical idea and desires to put it into practice. It is a welfare system where those who earn below a certain amount receive money from the government while those earning above it would pay taxes. The patricians deeply dislike the proposal but the commoners are enthusiastic, especially the poorer ones. "
FLO_open_the_gates:0 "Open The Gates"
FLO_open_the_gates_desc:0 "Many foreigners have expressed desire to migrate to our city and work here, because of our labour laws and negative income tax. But citizenship has traditionally been hard to obtain. By making it easy, we can attract thousands of immigrants and restore our diminished population to its former levels."
FLO_end_our_rivalry_marriage:0 "End Our Rivalry"
FLO_end_our_rivalry_marriage_desc:0 "Bruno's recent reforms have been warmly received by the common populace, but patricians despise them and are turning against him. All except for one family: The House of de Indigo, who are impressed by his generous policies. Bruno knows he needs a powerful ally to secure his position, so perhaps it is time to mend fences."
FLO_tax_cuts:0 "Tax Cuts"
FLO_tax_cuts_desc:0 "Chocolat imposed harsh taxes on the populace because of his misguided belief in trickle-down economics. Taxation rates must be returned to their former levels, or else we have a revolt in our claws!"
FLO_invite_yale_teachers:0 "Invite Educators From Yale"
FLO_invite_yale_teachers_desc:0 "While studying, Bruno met many teachers who taught him well and aided him when he struggled. Now that he has become the mayor of his home city, he can ask for their help once more and offer them well-paying jobs. The frauds hired by Chocolat will all be replaced by capable and experienced teachers."
FLO_trilingual_education:0 "Trilingual Education"
FLO_trilingual_education_desc:0 "While Aquileian has always been the official language of our city, we cannot ignore the fact that many migrants come from Herzland and some still speak our native tongue, Pomovarran. To ensure our workers can communicate not only with each other but also their employers, everyone must be taught the basics of each language."
FLO_department_of_affairs:0 "The Department Of Foreign Affairs"
FLO_department_of_affairs_desc:0 "Diplomacy is vital to us if we wish to maintain our independence. A new government department needs to be founded, dedicated to fostering good relations with other nations, strengthening our partnerships and maintaining peace and stability in the region."
FLO_align_aquileia:0 "Align With Aquileia"
FLO_align_aquileia_desc:0 "There is no questioning that Aquileia is our fatherland. The patricians of the city speak the language fluently and much of our culture is shared with the other Aquileian regions. While our relationship has been tense in the past, perhaps it is time to put our differences aside."
FLO_protection_from_empire:0 "The Imperial Threat"
FLO_protection_from_empire_desc:0 "The hegemonic imperialists of the north look upon our home with covetuous eyes, wishing to once again control it and force us to learn crude Griffish. We must seek protection from Aquileia, for surely they do not wish to repeat the mistakes of the past and let us fall into the claws of their enemy?"
FLO_embargo_empire:0 "Embargo The Empire"
FLO_embargo_empire_desc:0 "We have always exported a substantial amount of goods down the river Erne to Herzland, but now it is time to stop feeding the Imperial scum and instead look down south. Aquileian upper class is rather wealthy and would gladly purchase our luxury goods. Not only that, but we should stop giving loans to Herzlanders who go bankrupt anyways."
FLO_aquileian_only:0 "Aquileian Only"
FLO_aquileian_only_desc:0 "There is one culture above all, one that is more sophisticated than any other: Aquileian. The language is melodious and beautiful, its speakers are fashionable and well-educated, the cuisine is without peer. Meanwhile Herzlanders are blunt brutes with no sense of humour and poor taste in food and art. Let us be proud of our Aquileian identity!"
FLO_bankroll_aquileia:0 "Untapped Potential"
FLO_bankroll_aquileia_desc:0 "While the economy of Aquileia is not in the best condition, there is no doubt it is growing and could grow much faster. All it needs is an influx of capital and some wise investments. Bruno will motivate our patricians to purchase stocks and real estate at once."
FLO_aquileian_intelligentsia:0 "Invite Aquileian Intellectuals"
FLO_aquileian_intelligentsia_desc:0 "No one can deny that our city is a fine living place for scholars and scientists. We have many botanical gardens where they can ponder and study in peace, as well as many fine manors which can be repurposed into personal laboratories and rented. Not only that, but Bruno has promised subsidies to support them. Who could refuse an invitation?"
FLO_northeastern_bastion:0 "Aquileia's Northeastern Bastion"
FLO_northeastern_bastion_desc:0 "Long ago, before the rise of the Empire, Flowena was an imposing fortress responsible for guarding the northern border of the Kingdom. While our soldiers failed in their duty due to greed, it will not happen again as we are already wealthier than most Herzlander nobles. May we once more defend our fatherland from foreign invasion!"
FLO_cooperate_with_companies:0 "Cooperate With Aquileian Companies"
FLO_cooperate_with_companies_desc:0 "Aquila, Rila and Pridea are large cities bustling with economic activity, with many prospering companies.

FLO_aquileian_urban_area:0 "Aire Urbaine d'Aquileia"
FLO_aquileian_urban_area_desc:0 "It is time we reunite with our Patrie and seek closer integration into Aquileia. We can become an autonomous urban area, under protection of their mighty military and with full access to their markets. All we need to do is send a diplomat requesting they grant us this status."
FLO_espouse_empire:0 "Espouse The Empire"
FLO_espouse_empire_desc:0 "It was Emperor Grover III who made us into an Imperial Free City, granting us autonomy and saving us from the decadent rule of the wicked Discret dynasty. We should once again seek aid and protection from our former generous overlords."
FLO_bankroll_empire:0 "Bankroll The Empire"
FLO_bankroll_empire_desc:0 "Herzland was the former economic heartland of the Empire before the Revolution. In recent years it has begun to recover, with relatively high yearly growth. Bruno says that we should be wise and invest in the Empire, for not only would it help them, but we could gain substantial profits in the long run."
FLO_embargo_aquileia:0 "Embargo Aquileia"
FLO_embargo_aquileia_desc:0 "While Aquileia is an important trade partner for us, perhaps we should begin to focus more on northern commerce and abandon the markets of the south. Herzland has all the goods Aquileia has, so what do we need those arrogant baguette-munchers for? Not only that, but we should close the bank accounts of unreliable Discrets and dangerous revolutionaries."
FLO_herzlandification:0 "Begin Herzlandisation"
FLO_herzlandification_desc:0 "Aquileians are a joke. The posh and short-tempered frogs never pay their debts and constantly riot and revolt. On the contrary, Herzlanders are hard-working no-nonsense griffons who remain loyal to their overlords. We should therefore adopt their culture and make Griffish our only official language. Götter erhalten Grover den Kaiser!"
FLO_protection_from_aquileia:0 "The Aquileian Threat"
FLO_protection_from_aquileia_desc:0 "Dark clouds gather in the south as the devious Aquileians conspire to seize our freedom and put us in chains once more. We must seek aid from the north, from the mighty Empire whose vast armies could make cowardly Aquileians surrender by just marching towards them."
FLO_sister_city_romau:0 "Our Sister-City Romau"
FLO_sister_city_romau_desc:0 "Romau was the second Imperial Free City alongside us and we used to trade much back in the day. They have always been wealthier and more populous than us, but instead of being jealous, let us admire them and learn from them! There is much they can teach us, and together we can become more prosperous than ever."
FLO_imperial_garrison:0 "An Imperial Garrison"
FLO_imperial_garrison_desc:0 "If we are attacked, the Empire won't be able to immediately respond and aid us. Therefore they have wisely decided to station a permanent military garrison in our city to act as the first line of defence against the enemy. We are thankful for their ever-vigilant protection."
FLO_prelature_of_boreas:0 "Prelature Of Boreas"
FLO_prelature_of_boreas_desc:0 "Long has our priesthood lacked a formal leader, though the leader of the Cult of Boreas has always been the most influential one. But thanks to our warmer relations with the Archons of the Empire, we can request that they grant us religious autonomy and our own Prelate who would lead our priests."
FLO_imperial_free_city:0 "An Imperial Free City"
FLO_imperial_free_city_desc:0 "For almost two centuries we were an Imperial Free City, enjoying peace and autonomy under the protection of the gracious Empire. Now that golden age shall return as we send a diplomat to Griffenheim to swear fealty to the Emperor and request the status of a Free City."
FLO_side_skyfall:0 "Side With Skyfall"
FLO_side_skyfall_desc:0 "The merchant princes of the west have much in common with us.

Us traders must stand together in these troubled times and work together to secure our golden liberty."
FLO_financial_support:0 "Invest In The West"
FLO_financial_support_desc:0 "Skyfall is one of the largest economic centers on the continent, so there is no doubt any investments would pay themselves back quickly. With Bruno's encouragement, our patricians will soon turn their gaze to the lucrative markets of the western coast."
FLO_skyfall_flowena_railway:0 "Flowena-Skyfall Railway"
FLO_skyfall_flowena_railway_desc:0 "Bruno has proposed an intriguing idea to the Seigneurie. He says that to foster closer ties with Skyfall, we should build a railway between our nations. This would, of course, require the consent of the countries between us but if successful, the new railroad would become a vital and profitable trade route."
FLO_mutual_threats:0 "Asking For Aid"
FLO_mutual_threats_desc:0 "We are but one city, and beyond our borders powerful despots plan to conquer and pillage us. We must ask Skyfall, our friend and commercial partner, to guarantee our freedom. They might just be our only hope."
FLO_trade_with_skyfall:0 "Trade With Skyfall"
FLO_trade_with_skyfall_desc:0 "The merchants of Skyfall desire our fine cloths and wonderful perfumes and also wish to use our banking services more regularly. On the other claw we wish to purchase their industrial goods such as cars and machinery. It is time to sign agreements so trade begins to flow between our two nations."
FLO_shared_patents:0 "Shared Patents"
FLO_shared_patents_desc:0 "The companies and innovators of Skyfall have patented many wondrous technologies and own exclusive rights to them. However, our warm relations might make them willing to share their technological marvels with us, and in return we can let them produce and sell our own inventions."
FLO_mercenaries_for_skyfall:0 "Mercenaries For Skyfall"
FLO_mercenaries_for_skyfall_desc:0 "In return for all the good things the griffons of Skyfall have done for us, we should provide them something in return. Bruno is negotiating with several companies of Herzlander mercenaries and wishes to hire them, but instead of fighting for us they will fight for Skyfall."
FLO_skyfall_branch_offices:0 "Skyfall Branch Offices"
FLO_skyfall_branch_offices_desc:0 "With increased trade, companies from Skyfall have already greatly increased their influence in our city. By allowing them to set up branch offices, we can seek even closer cooperation and increased profit margins."
FLO_the_golden_league:0 "The Golden League"
FLO_the_golden_league_desc:0 "Flowena and Skyfall have become truly close partners, cooperating in commerce, military and science. We have found common ground in our love of gold and become close friends, albeit not official ones. Perhaps it is time to approach them and propose a formal alliance between our two nations."
FLO_armed_neutrality:0 "Armed Neutrality"
FLO_armed_neutrality_desc:0 "Flowena has stood alone for decades, and it shall stand for many decades more. We do not wish to take part in the bloody game of thrones played by foreign lords and only ask for one thing: To be left alone, at peace and in freedom. Those who do not respect our single desire will soon realize we are stronger than we seem."
FLO_domestic_arms:0 "Domestic Arms Production"
FLO_domestic_arms_desc:0 "We cannot exclusively rely on foreign imports to supply our military. Because we might get surrounded by enemies, we need to be self-reliable. Considerable funds shall be invested into our arms industry so we can expand our production greatly."
FLO_negotiate_with_neighbours:0 "Negotiate With Neighbours"

FLO_standing_army:0 "A Standing Army"
FLO_standing_army_desc:0 "A ragtag militia is not sufficient for properly defending our city. It needs to be reformed into a proper military force, with full-time soldiers, trained officers and advanced organization. Conscription will become the sworn duty of all eligible griffons, so we will have no shortage of soldiers."
FLO_RD_department:0 "Establish A R&D Department"
FLO_RD_department_desc:0 "Our equipment and tools must not be outdated if we wish to remain competitive with the economies and militaries of other nations. Bruno has hired some of the finer minds on Griffonia to work together and innovate, helping us catch up to more advanced countries in the world."
FLO_university_flowena:0 "The University Of Flowena"
FLO_university_flowena_desc:0 "Because Flowena has never had a university, griffons like Bruno had to study abroad in other countries such as Yale. Our mayor wishes that no citizen would ever need to leave their home city because of their studies and has funded the foundation of a new university, which will surely become one of the finer ones in Griffonia."
FLO_purchase_moar_weapons:0 "Purchase Even More Rifles"
FLO_purchase_moar_weapons_desc:0 "While we do need to be self-reliant, buying some more weapons wouldn't hurt. We can also reverse-engineer foreign designs and thus enhance our own rifle models. This would certainly be worth the money."
FLO_flowena_will_be_free:0 "Flowena Will Be Free"
FLO_flowena_will_be_free_desc:0 "Our nation is a tiny island of peace and prosperity in an ocean of poverty and chaos. Our people are willing to die to preserve their precious freedom, for they never again wish to live as slaves. May Flowena prevail forever!"
FLO_mediate_between_giants:0 "Mediate Between Giants"
FLO_mediate_between_giants_desc:0 "The tensions between Aquileia and the Empire keep rising and war between them seems inevitable. We are caught in the middle and both desire to seize our lands before the other can. To prevail, we must come in between the two major powers and try to talk some sense into them. Only then can we avoid total war engulfing us all."
FLO_discipline_workers:0 "Discipline The Workers"
FLO_discipline_workers_desc:0 "The commoners must know their place in our hierarchical society. They exist to provide patricians with labour and they must do so without complaint. A revolt must be nipped in the bud, even if it requires hiring expensive mercenaries. Ensuring stability and order in Flowena is worth any cost."
FLO_evict_the_poor:0 "Banish The Poor"
FLO_evict_the_poor_desc:0 "Unemployed beggars do not belong in our fair city. Let it be known that to deserve a citizenship you must work and earn enough money to sustain yourself. We do not need parasites leeching off our economy."
FLO_sponsorship_system:0 "Introduce The Sponsorship System"
FLO_sponsorship_system_desc:0 "Our workforce was greatly reduced in size by the Wet Plague. We must replenish it by bringing in migrant workers. Bruno has proposed to introduce a sponsorship system to monitor them. It will require all unskilled labourers to have a sponsor, usually their employer. The sponsors are their guardians and have complete control over them."
FLO_end_our_rivalry_murder:0 "End Our Rivalry"
FLO_end_our_rivalry_murder_desc:0 "While patricians praise Bruno's harsh policies and the populace cowers in fear, the damned family of de Indigo incited a revolt among the commoners to overthrow the House of de Rosebrune. Those age-long foes must be taken care of once and for all!"
FLO_increse_militia_pay:0 "Pay Rise For Militia"
FLO_increse_militia_pay_desc:0 "How could Chocolat even consider lowering salaries of militiagriffs? They are our finest and most reliable defenders, willing to die in defence of their home city. Besides, increasing government spending provides a good stimulant for the economy."
FLO_purchase_weapons:0 "Purchase Rifles"
FLO_purchase_weapons_desc:0 "Our militiagriffs have traditionally been responsible for acquiring their own weapons, but they always buy cheapest possible guns. How can we hope to retain our independence if our griffons use outdated weapons from the last millenium? The government clearly needs to provide soldiers with proper equipment."
FLO_promote_officers:0 "Promote Officers"
FLO_promote_officers_desc:0 "The plague culled the ranks of our officers badly and we lost many talented commanders, among them Astrit Koch herself. How can our militia defend our city without proper leadership? We must promote promising soldiers and low-ranking officers to higher positions."
FLO_art_of_the_deal:0 "The Art Of The Deal"
FLO_art_of_the_deal_desc:0 "Mercenaries are ultimately merchants of death, and merchants can always be haggled with. Bruno knows just what to say to ensure they accept a lower price and fight for us longer before abandoning us."
FLO_found_flower_guard:0 "Found The Flower Guard"
FLO_found_flower_guard_desc:0 "While our militia are skilled and dependable, the patricians need a more loyal and professional military unit to protect them from harm, especially if the commoners foolishly decide to revolt against our just rule. The Flower Guard are such a unit, trained by Nicolas de Charbon and equipped with the finest weapons money can buy."
FLO_revise_drilling_methods:0 "Revise Drilling Methods"
FLO_revise_drilling_methods_desc:0 "While our militiagriffs are part-time soldiers, they still train extensively and hone their skills. However, the nature of warfare is changing quickly. Our newly promoted commanders will reform our training programs and refine them, so our militia will be prepared to fight a modern war."
FLO_doctrine_of_defence:0 "Doctrine Of Defence"
FLO_doctrine_of_defence_desc:0 "We must stand strong if we wish to retain our independence. Others look upon our shining, wealthy city with greedy eyes and rub their claws, plotting our doom. Let their pathetic attacks break upon our defences like waves break upon rocks!"
FLO_hire_rogue_knights:0 "Hire Rogue Knights"
FLO_hire_rogue_knights_desc:0 "There are many knigthly orders in Griffonia, with most in regular service to some country. Yet some knights are wandering ones, sleeping under hedges in the countryside, always seeking for employment. Bruno will meet these knights in person and offer them a lucrative deal they cannot refuse."
FLO_urban_combat_training:0 "Urban Combat Training"
FLO_urban_combat_training_desc:0 "If we are attacked, combat will not take place on wide open plains, shadowy forests or tall mountains, but on the streets and bridges of our dear city. Therefore our militia must know how to wage warfare in an urban setting, and how to make the enemy pay dearly for every building they capture."
FLO_secure_river_trade:0 "Secure River Trade"
FLO_secure_river_trade_desc:0 "The rivers Erne and Pom are our most vital commercial routes, with Erne, the northern river, being a connection between Aquileia and Herzland and the southern river, Pom, flowing down from the ore-rich mountains of Westkeep which supply our foundries. We must prevent a blockade from hostile Pomovarra and seize the riverbanks!"
FLO_defend_skies:0 "Defend The Skies"
FLO_defend_skies_desc:0 "While griffon warfare has always been three-dimensional, the danger coming from above is now greater than ever thanks to bombers and fighters which can rain fire and doom upon us. We cannot allow our fair city to be destroyed from the skies and must expand our defences before it is too late."
FLO_partition_pomovarra:0 "Partition Pomovarra"
FLO_partition_pomovarra_desc:0 "Now that the threat of Pomovarra has been eliminated, we must choose what to do with the lands we have taken. Camris will be integrated and allowed to form its own militias, while Pomovarran loyalty will be ensured by giving them limited autonomy and a nominally republican government. Bruno decided that his cousin Camille will be elected as its leader."
FLO_anti_tank_tactics:0 "Anti-Tank Tactics"
FLO_anti_tank_tactics_desc:0 "The modern age brings with it not only wonders, but also terrors. Tanks are one such example, armoured beasts of steel with heavy weaponry, able to traverse almost any terrain. We must make sure our militia is trained and equipped to face such a terrible threat."
FLO_a_token_airforce:0 "A Token Airforce"
FLO_a_token_airforce_desc:0 "While we do not have the industrial capacity nor the griffonpower to accomodate a proper air force, we can maintain a small one to aid in the defence of our city and ensure we control the skies instead of the enemy. Luckily we have found independent contractors who are willing to sell outdated planes for a discounted price."

FLO_champions_of_the_people:0 "Friends Of The People"
FLO_champions_of_the_people_desc:0 "The House of de Indigo has always championed the rights of the commoners and strived to end the conflict between the classes before it was too late. With the despotic dynasty of de Rosebrune finally usurped, they were now in power and could at last bring peace and democracy to Flowena."
FLO_protect_clients:0 "Protect Our Questionable Clients"
FLO_protect_clients_desc:0 "While some see our banking secrecy laws as controversial, their only intention is to protect our clients and maintain confidentiality. It might be true that some of them might be considered criminals in their home countries; After all, some of them are persecuted minorities and just rebels. But it is not our problem. We simply provide them a service."
FLO_abolish_secrecy:0 "Abolish Banking Secrecy"
FLO_abolish_secrecy_desc:0 "Far too long have our banks served criminals and magnates who use their accounts for money laundering and tax evasion. This ends now!

FLO_western_gardens_desc:0 "To honour the poor lives lost during the Great Fire, when the western borough was utterly destroyed, we will turn the ruins into a garden and plant numerous seeds in the ash, so that one day it will be a flourishing and beautiful garden that can also provide valuable dye for our painters and textile factories."
FLO_culture_festival:0 "The Festival of Culture"
FLO_culture_festival_desc:0 "Flowena is a melting pot of many cultures: Aquileian, Herzlander and Pomovarran. This unique blend defines our identity and should be celebrated. Anna de Indigo is now preparing a grand celebration to display the finest accomplishments of our people."
FLO_finest_perfumes:0 "Best Perfumes"
FLO_finest_perfumes_desc:0 "Our vast collection of exotic plants gives us all we need to create exquisite fragrances, but sadly our standards lowered during the reign of de Rosebrune who wished to make a profit via mass production. Now we shall focus more on quality and ensure our products have the highest standard. With good reputation comes more demand."
FLO_plague_memorial:0 "En Mémoire"
FLO_plague_memorial_desc:0 "Due to the incompetent rule of the accursed de Rosebrune family, Wet Plague spread like wildfire, infecting and killing thousands. The entire city is still shaken, but perhaps erecting a memorial to honour those who perished will help us overcome the anguish of losing loved ones."
FLO_flowenan_fashion:0 "Flowenan Fashion"
FLO_flowenan_fashion_desc:0 "Already our well-made and vibrantly dyed textiles are famed throughout Griffonia. We can further promote them by hiring talented fashion designers and holding shows where their designs are displayed for all to see. By showing what miraculous things can be created with our cloth, we will surely gain many customers."
FLO_pollution_tax:0 "Introduce Pollution Tax"
FLO_pollution_tax_desc:0 "Our city has long had the reputation of being the most beautiful city on the continent thanks to our many gardens, but the rise of modern industry is threatening this title. Toxic fumes turn the air black and kill the flowers while waste is being dumped into the rivers. To save our city, we must discourage such behavior by taxing the polluters."
FLO_public_healthcare:0 "Universal Healthcare"
FLO_public_healthcare_desc:0 "The Wet Plague was a wake-up call for all of us, but especially the government. We must take active measures to ensure public hygiene and cover the expenses of healthcare for those who may not otherwise be able to afford it. It will be expensive, but for us the well-being of our citizens is more valuable than gold."
FLO_tourism_board:0 "Establish A Tourism Board"
FLO_tourism_board_desc:0 "The many sights of our famously gorgeous city already attract thousands of visitors every year, yet there is clearly untapped potential in our nascent tourism industry. By founding a governmental board tasked with promoting Flowena abroad and displaying our culture, as well as coordinating hotels and travel agents within our city."
FLO_open_international_airport:0 "Open An International Airport"
FLO_open_international_airport_desc:0 "Our tourism board has suggested we open a grand airport for foreign passengers, so anyone can easily book a flight and come to our city. Easier access will allow tourism to grow exponentially, and purchasing passenger airplanes will enable us to study their designs and improve our own planes."
FLO_synthetic_crystal_experiments:0 "Synthetic Crystal Experiments"
FLO_synthetic_crystal_experiments_desc:0 "Crystals are a fascinating material to work with, but so far we have had to import it from abroad. Our finest minds have recently experimented with using magic to encourage growth of crystals in controlled laboratory environments and have achieved a breakthrough. We can now synthesize crystals on a large scale, but we must jealously guard our secrets."
FLO_fate_of_rosebrune:0 "The Fate Of Our Rivals"
FLO_fate_of_rosebrune_desc:0 "Now that we have at last usurped our nemeses and liberated Flowena from their oppressive rule, we must decide what to do with them. Maybe it is best to simply exile them, or perhaps we can show them mercy when they would've shown us none and thus prove our moral superiority."
FLO_free_guild_membership:0 "Ease Restrictions On Guilds"
FLO_free_guild_membership_desc:0 "Many years now the common workers of our city have complained that they are barred from applying for guild membership and forbidden entirely from founding guilds of their own. Ancient laws have remained in place so far only because patricians wish to greedily hold on to their privileges. Now the commoners shall finally receive what they desire."
FLO_a_true_republic:0 "A True Republic"
FLO_a_true_republic_desc:0 "Officially, Flowena is a Republic, but the name has little to do with reality. Rigged, pre-determined sortitions are used to choose the members of the Seigneurie, which only accepts patricians. Now reforms shall be implemented and true democracy will arrive in our city at last! Elections are being prepared so the temporary government can finally step down."
FLO_welfare_program:0 "Start A Welfare Program"
FLO_welfare_program_desc:0 "Poverty rates in our city skyrocketed during the end of Chocolat's terrible reign, with many griffons begging on the streets or resorting to crime to sustain themselves. We must ensure the well-being of our citizenry, but it will be expensive. Thankfully, de Indigo and their allied families have pledged to forgive debts and fund a welfare program."
FLO_protect_workers:0 "Protect The Workers"
FLO_protect_workers_desc:0 "No more shall the patricians treat their employees like destitute slaves! We will give the workers all they wish for and protect the weak from abuse.

FLO_patronage_of_arts:0 "Patronage Of The Arts"
FLO_patronage_of_arts_desc:0 "De Indigo have always been eager supporters of promising artists, gathering many famous ones under their wing. Now they wish to make the state itself a patron as well and are seeking painters, sculptors, musicians, writers and filmmakers from all across Griffonia. Unlike Chocolat, they can recognize true talent and will likely find many brilliant minds."
FLO_finest_free_education:0 "Finest Free Education"
FLO_finest_free_education_desc:0 "Our youth are our future, so investing in them is the wisest investment one can make. We must replace the hack frauds hired by Chocolat with competent teachers who care about their students and pay them a high salary, to make the position of teacher a respectable and desirable one."
FLO_harmony_between_classes:0 "Harmony Between Classes"
FLO_harmony_between_classes_desc:0 "The rich no longer oppress the poor, all thanks to the efforts of Anna and her family. While some patricians continue to complain, most have seen that a happy worker is a productive worker, and appreciate how de Indigo have increased the prestige of Flowena by hiring many talented artists. Clearly, the classes can co-exist in peace together."
FLO_expand_curriculum:0 "Expand The Curriculum"
FLO_expand_curriculum_desc:0 "The schools of Flowena have long taught practical matters such as mathematics and physics. However, we cannot let our children be narrow-minded, but instead expand their horizons. New subjects shall be introduced, ranging from art and music to new languages. This way every young griffon will grow up to become civilized and open-minded."
FLO_haven_of_freedom:0 "A Haven Of Freedom"
FLO_haven_of_freedom_desc:0 "The citizens of our small Republic enjoy unrivaled liberty and well-being. Now word begins to spread and griffons from all across Griffonia flock to us, wishing to join our blessed society and share in our happiness. We shall welcome them all with open wings."
FLO_academy_of_social_sciences:0 "The Academy Of Social Sciences"
FLO_academy_of_social_sciences_desc:0 "We may have expanded our curriculum, but we still lack specialized institutions for social sciences. Establishing an academy and inviting foreign intellectuals will allow us to refine our knowledge of ourselves as well as the world around us."
FLO_spread_the_word:0 "Spread The Word"
FLO_spread_the_word_desc:0 "While we have created a pleasant little oasis of democracy and freedom, we cannot simply isolate ourselves and ignore oppression and danger beyond our borders. No, we must find strong allies who share our values, and send aid to those who struggle to liberate themselves. It is our duty to improve the lives of all, no matter the cost."
FLO_revive_tongue:0 "Revive Our Native Tongue"
FLO_revive_tongue_desc:0 "Centuries ago everygriff in Flowena spoke Pomovarran, but over time migration from Aquileia and Herzland put the old language aside in favour of more cosmopolitan and practical tongues. To preserve our identity and cultural heritage, we must take immediate action to officialize Pomovarran and teach it to the youth, before it is too late."
FLO_crystal_computing:0 "Crystal Computing"
FLO_crystal_computing_desc:0 "Crystals can be used for artwork and weaponry, but they might have other uses as well. Because they can be charged with magical energy and emptied, they could be used to store binary data. Developing a machine to manage this data would be a true scientific accomplishment."
FLO_liberate_avian:0 "Liberty In Avian"
FLO_liberate_avian_desc:0 "Avian is known as a realm of aristocrats, who despotically rule the fertile countryside and oppress the poor peasantry. This reputation must be erased and Avian needs to be born anew as a free and equal nation."
FLO_liberate_aethel:0 "Democracy In Greifwald"
FLO_liberate_aethel_desc:0 "The untamed and dark forests of Greifwald were sundered when local outlaws in Adelart liberated the local populace from cruel taxation. This alone proved the rule of Count Cloudet's dynasty illegitimate. Yet the Adelart outlaws did not introduce true democracy and freedom. That is something we shall do, then."
FLO_liberate_houses:0 "Prosperity In Verenia"
FLO_liberate_houses_desc:0 "For decades now the two noble Houses of Erie and Eyrie have been locked in an intense rivalry, caring little for the suffering of their subjects and waging constant war for selfish reasons. Does this not prove to all how flawed aristocratic rule is? We must intervene and ensure peace prevails in the east so it can once more prosper."
FLO_liberate_pomovarra:0 "Embrace Our Motherland"
FLO_liberate_pomovarra_desc:0 "Our city was once part of Pomovarra before Emperor Grover III granted us the status of an Imperial Free City.

FLO_city_of_lights_desc:0 "Flowena is the home of the free, a blossoming flower admired across Western Griffonia.

FLO_sack_nicolas:0 "Sack Nicolas de Charbon"
FLO_sack_nicolas_desc:0 "Nicolas, the last scion of the venerable but notorious de Charbon family, cannot be trusted with such a high-ranking position in the militia. The relations between our families were never warm and we have always denounced their fondness of authoritarian rule. If we do not remove him, he might use the loyalty of his soldiers against us!"
FLO_marry_nicolas:0 "Propose A Marriage"
FLO_marry_nicolas_desc:0 "If Nicolas does not find a blue-blooded partner, he will be the last member of his ancient House. As such, how could he possibly refuse an offer of a wedding? With his bloodline secure, he will certainly remain loyal to our family and abandon any plots he might have been weaving in the shadows."
FLO_the_peoples_army:0 "The People's Army"
FLO_the_peoples_army_desc:0 "The militia of the city has always been composed of not only patricians but the commoners as well. Being a member of the defence force and being allowed to wield weapons was long the only way for them to gain any kind of power. Now that we are a becoming a true republic, the militia should become a proper army to ensure the people remain in power."
FLO_rather_death_than_dishonor:0 "Kentoc'h Mervel Eget Bezañ Saotret"
FLO_rather_death_than_dishonor_desc:0 "The warriors of Pomovarra had always had a famous motto: Rather Death Than Dishonour. We shall now resurrect this ancient saying and teach it to our soldiers, so they can fight with the same fury their ancestors did and do everything they can to defend their golden liberty. Using it in recruitment posters will surely be effective."
FLO_arm_the_army:0 "Arm The Army"
FLO_arm_the_army_desc:0 "We might have many proud recruits joining the ranks of the People's Army, but what can they do without guns and equipment? It is vital we subsidise and support our arms producers and supply our soldiers with government-mandated weapons instead of forcing them to buy their own equipment."
FLO_patriotic_duty:0 "Patriotic Duty"
FLO_patriotic_duty_desc:0 "It is the obligation of every citizen to do everything they can to preserve our freedom. This sacred task must be enshrined in law and all able-bodied griffons must answer the call to arms to defend their dear city from oppressive invaders."
FLO_guardians_of_liberty:0 "Guardians Of Liberty"
FLO_guardians_of_liberty_desc:0 "The most fanatical supporters of democracy in our city have strong esprit de corps, so it is clear they would fight best if grouped together. Therefore we shall allow them to form their own brigades which will certainly be the most ferocious fighting force in our army."
FLO_affordable_design:0 "Affordable Design"
FLO_affordable_design_desc:0 "We have so many recruits voluntarily joining the army that we struggle to purchase enough weapons for them all! Clearly arms production must be reformed so all our brave citizen soldiers can be given all they need to defend us from foreign threats. Quality will be lower as a result, but it is something we have to sacrifice for the greater good."
FLO_democratic_fervour:0 "Democratic Fervour"
FLO_democratic_fervour_desc:0 "The struggle for liberty is not confined within the borders of our city. It is a global struggle, and all across the world the oppressed call for aid as they strive to overthrow their oppressors. Can we simply stand idly by and spectate? Many soldiers think not, and demand to be allowed to join conflicts abroad. It is time we allow them to fight."
FLO_magitek_rifles:0 "Magitek Rifle Experiments"
FLO_magitek_rifles_desc:0 "The sharpest minds of our institutions have recently been experimenting with a novel idea of using magical crystals to power weapons. They now request funding from the government, so they could create a batch of prototype rifles. They say it will be risky, but if they succeed it will be well worth it and we could equip our army with new, revolutionary weapons."
FLO_healing_herbs:0 "Healing Herbs"
FLO_healing_herbs_desc:0 "While the numerous plants of our gardens are mostly used to fuel our industry, they could be used in a more altruistic way as well. Many of the rarer flowers could be refined into medicine and healing potions, which our brave soldiers could then use if they get wounded in battle or fall ill."
FLO_weaponized_flowers:0 "Weaponized Flowers"
FLO_weaponized_flowers_desc:0 "While flowers and other plants can be used to heal, they can also be used to harm. Over the years our gardens have acquired a collection of beautiful and valuable but extremely hazardous flora, such as mutation-causing Poison Joke and Swamp Fever-inducing water lilies. These can be refined into biological weapons that incapacitate the enemy instead of killing them."

FLO_long_live_revolution:0 "The Rebirth Of Flowena"
FLO_long_live_revolution_desc:0 "The patricians tremble in terror as the red sun rises upon a truly free city, liberated from bourgeois oppression and rescued from capitalist affliction. This dawn marks the beginning of our city's reformation into a true workers' paradise."
FLO_empty_the_vaults:0 "Empty The Vaults"
FLO_empty_the_vaults_desc:0 "Like dragons, the patricians hoarded wealth in their underground vaults for centuries, refusing to give it to those who needed it and loaning it at high interest to those who asked for it. The time for justice has come: We will interrogate the banker filth to find out how to get inside their vaults and break into them with dynamite if need be!"
FLO_universal_guild_membership:0 "Universal Guild Membership"
FLO_universal_guild_membership_desc:0 "Before, guilds were exclusive clubs to the wealthiest sons and daughters of the founding citizens of Flowena. There were guilds for the most prestigious jobs only, the merchants, the judges, the administrators, the master crafters. No more! In our new Flowena, every labourer can join or form a guild and enjoy all the privileges and protections granted by it."
FLO_eat_the_rich:0 "End The Patrician Class"
FLO_eat_the_rich_desc:0 "Class warfare is about to come to its end in our city. The bourgeoisie are utterly defeated and broken, powerless to resist as we strip them of their special rights and turn them into regular citizens. Let them wail and mourn as much as they want, but they will not cling on to their possessions for much longer."
FLO_empty_the_temples:0 "Empty The Temples"
FLO_empty_the_temples_desc:0 "The clergy, too, has enjoyed special privileges and gathered taxes in the name of their gods. Over the years the temples have been filled with unjustly seized wealth of griffons who actually worked to earn a living, instead of the priests who did nothing but pray to their imaginary friends in the clouds. Their spacious temples shall become warehouses for collectively owned supplies."
FLO_universal_guild_ownership:0 "Universal Guild Ownership"
FLO_universal_guild_ownership_desc:0 "Private property is a patrician's tool of exploitation, allowing them to suck their workers dry like a vampire without lifting a claw. As such it must be replaced with common ownership by those that use the property for production of goods and services. The workers' guilds shall own all means of production from now on!"
FLO_revolutionary_militia:0 "Defenders Of The Working Class"
FLO_revolutionary_militia_desc:0 "While militiagriffs are wealthier on average than common citizens because they can afford to acquire weapons and helmets, they are still part of the proletariat. We should remind everyone of this and not only welcome them among us, but give them the honourable duty of guarding their fellow comrades from reactionary aggression."
FLO_guild_congress:0 "The Congress Of Guilds"
FLO_guild_congress_desc:0 "With the corrupt and oligarchic institution of Seigneurie gone, our city needs a new, proper government to lead it. With the guilds owning all property and having all working citizens as their members, it is clear they should lead the city-state's affairs. Therefore a congress of elected guild representatives shall be established."
FLO_model_district:0 "A Model District"
FLO_model_district_desc:0 "The fire that destroyed the poor slums in the west was a symbolic event. Red flames have cleansed poverty and inequality from our city, and in the place of hovels new houses and workshops shall be built. The new western borough will be one designed with the common worker in mind, not the capitalist patrician. Finest, standardized and most importantly hygienic homes for all!"
FLO_abolish_flowins:0 "Abolish Flowins"
FLO_abolish_flowins_desc:0 "Currency is wealth in its purest form and its accumulation and hoarding is one of the primary causes of inequality. To prevent the past from repeating itself, we must melt all the coins and burn all the bank notes. Gold will be used for foreign trade only while the citizenry will simply get what they need from bakeries and collective stores."
FLO_secularization:0 "Secularization"
FLO_secularization_desc:0 "The worker should not be subject to anyone, not even the gods. For countless centuries have priests used faith for deception and blackmail, demanding tithe and threatening with divine punishment. We will not fall for their tricks ever again! The clergy must be defanged and any support for religious institutions ended at once. Rationalism and empiricism will be the new core values of our society."
FLO_workers_army:0 "The Workers' Army"
FLO_workers_army_desc:0 "While before the militia's duty was guarding their paymasters, now they have a far more important task: Defending the city from foreign oppressors and feudal lords. As such, their ranks need to be expanded with all the volunteers we can get, no matter their country of origin. Even disgruntled and disillusioned mercenaries are willing yo join us and train the new units."
FLO_produce_for_people:0 "Need Before Greed"
FLO_produce_for_people_desc:0 "The many workshops and factories of our city were always preoccupied with producing luxury goods for export, so the patrician owners could earn a profit. The workers were forced to buy consumer goods from abroad at a high price. This comes to an end now: Instead of expensive perfume and fine textiles, we will mass produce tools, household goods, vehicles and guns."
FLO_decentral_planned_economy:0 "Decentrally-Planned Economy"
FLO_decentral_planned_economy_desc:0 "To avoid the fluctuations and inherent inequality of a market economy, we must adopt a planned economy like other workers' states have. However, it will not be a Stalliongradian centrally planned economy where a clique of bureaucrats decide everything. The guilds will cooperate and formulate a plan for production and distribution together, with every worker having a say."
FLO_public_gardens:0 "Make The Gardens Public"
FLO_public_gardens_desc:0 "Various botanical gardens are scattered across our city, but they have always been off-limits to those who did not work at them. For the patricians, the flowers were cogs of their economic machine, churning out profit by producing valuable dye. In this new chapter of our history, the gardens will have an entirely new role, besides supplying our textile factories."
FLO_voice_of_labour:0 "The Voice Of Labour"
FLO_voice_of_labour_desc:0 "Like other advanced cities of the world, Flowena too needs its affordable, widely distributed newspaper. But unlike abroad, it won't be bourgeois propaganda, but articles written by the workers, for the workers. The text will be made easy to read so the less literate among us can practice reading with them, but it will also be as informative as possible."
FLO_teachers_guild:0 "Expand The Teachers' Guild"
FLO_teachers_guild_desc:0 "Among other professions, the teachers as well have established their own guild. However, after Chocolat's mismanagement they are few in number and need more members so they can educate the entire population of our city. This is why we must invite foreign leftist intellectuals into our city and offer them membership in the guild."
FLO_proletariat_generals:0 "Proletariat Generals"
FLO_proletariat_generals_desc:0 "While commoners were welcome into the ranks of militia, they had great difficulty rising through the ranks and becoming leaders. With the old order dismantled, this has changed and it is time for us to promote promising young working class officers, as our militia lacks leaders."
FLO_stg_doctrine:0 "Stalliongradian Principles Of War"
FLO_stg_doctrine_desc:0 "To the west, Stalliongrad managed to fend off the vast nation of Equestria primarily thanks to their innovative tactics, which they continue to adopt to this day. They emphasize speed, mobility, logistics and rapid warfare, seizing the initiative before the ponderous enemy even knows what hit them. We should follow their example and adapt our military production accordingly."
FLO_gunsmith_guild:0 "Expand The Gunsmiths' Guild"
FLO_gunsmith_guild_desc:0 "A rifle is a democratic weapon, giving power to every griffon who wields one. As such we must proliferate our arms and ensure all citizens can get one. To accomplish this, new gunsmiths need to be trained and invited from abroad, and their workshops greatly expanded by the Masons' Guild."
FLO_car_manufactory:0 "An Automobile Manufactory"
FLO_car_manufactory_desc:0 "Cars were seen as a luxury item only owned by the richest of griffons, but this will now change. By opening a new factory for mass-producing affordable vehicles, every citizen will eventually be able to acquire a car and use it for quick and easy travel. During times of conflict the factory can be repurposed for war-time production as well."
FLO_workers_culture:0 "Working Griffons' Culture"
FLO_workers_culture_desc:0 "Instead of being mocked by patricians, the common culture of the proletariat is now not only respected, but admired. Hard work, camaraderie and freedom of expression are defining aspects of it. Workers, now having more free time than ever, experiment with new art forms and old boundaries between Aquileian, Herzlander and Pomovarran are quickly vanishing, replaced by a class-wide culture."
FLO_vocational_schools:0 "Open Vocational Schools"
FLO_vocational_schools_desc:0 "Instead of bourgeois institutions which focused so much on useless abstraction and cost a fortune, our secondary education needs to focus on practicality and be free of charge for all workers. These schools prepare students to directly enter the workforce after they've graduated and focus on job-specific training."
FLO_militiagriff_guild:0 "The Militiagriff's Guild"
FLO_militiagriff_guild_desc:0 "The militia, too, are workers, and thus deserve their own guild that ensures the rights and wellbeing of its members. With more organization, the militia can also train better, share tactics and strategies and revise their doctrines."
FLO_army_mechanization:0 "Mechanized Militia"
FLO_army_mechanization_desc:0 "Our militia must not just rely on their paws and wings for movement. In this modern age, mobility is the key, and vehicles allow us to go faster than ever before. With the workers hard at work making new trucks and cars, our militia should make use of them."
FLO_fires_of_industry:0 "Fires Of Industry"
FLO_fires_of_industry_desc:0 "To provide work for all and to fulfill the needs of every worker, our factories must keep expanding, and labour must never cease. The old bourgeois world will burn in the fires of industry."
FLO_city_of_workers:0 "The City Of Workers"
FLO_city_of_workers_desc:0 "The transformation of Flowena from a vile den of greedy patricians into a commune of the common labourers is finally fully complete. Our dreams are achieved, but the international struggle is far from over. Nevertheless, for now we can celebrate and enjoy the fruits of our labour."
FLO_tank_prototype:0 "Tank Prototype"
FLO_tank_prototype_desc:0 "Stalliongradian advisors have told us much of the new armoured combat vehicle simply known as the tank. With their help, our workers have been hard at work designing and building prototypes, so we could eventually begin domestic production of these machines of war and supply them to our militia."
FLO_expand_fuel_stores:0 "Expand Fuel Stores"
FLO_expand_fuel_stores_desc:0 "As we modernize our society, fuel becomes increasingly important. Not only is it the lifeblood of our industry, but our army as well as we continue to mechanize it. With no domestic oil production, we must expand our storages, so we can ensure our supply of fuel even if we get cut off from the rest of the world."
FLO_public_transportation:0 "Public Transportation"
FLO_public_transportation_desc:0 "Every worker hates daily commutes, as travel from their homes to the workplace along the narrow, crowded streets takes many hours. To improve our lives, we will build trams and buses and trains as well as the infrastructure they require to function, allowing every worker to travel across the city with ease in less than an hour."
FLO_modern_tools:0 "Modern Tools"
FLO_modern_tools_desc:0 "Right tools are needed for the right job, and modern jobs need modern tools. With increased efficiency, we could easily reduce working hours while keeping production at the same level, giving us all more free time. It will be a lot of work to adopt new gadgets and machines, but it will be worth it in the end."
FLO_aid_comrades:0 "Aid Our Comrades"
FLO_aid_comrades_desc:0 "We cannot simply ignore the plight of fellow workers in neighbouring nations. It is our duty to go on the offensive and spread the revolution, to crush the bourgeoisie wherever they are. If we do nothing, we will be easy prey for foreign despots. Onwards! The blood of martyrs shall water the soil, and from the crimson earth red flowers will bloom!"
FLO_prol_paradise:0 "A Paradise Of The Proletariat"
FLO_prol_paradise_desc:0 "Instead of gambling all we have and waging destructive wars, we should focus inwards and make the world know what a haven for the workers we have created. We will fulfill our duty to our fellow workers with indirect support, by sending arms and volunteers, and welcoming any refugees. Lastly, the enemy shall know that we will defend our gardens of freedom to the death if need be!"
FLO_rapid_communication:0 "Rapid Warfare Requires Rapid Communication"
FLO_rapid_communication_desc:0 "If a fighting force wishes to remain cohesive and united in purpose, they need to be able to relay messages to each other well. And if that force moves rapidly, so must their messages. Thankfully modern radio technology makes this possible, so our militiagriffs can always keep in touch with each other and maintain strong unity."
FLO_someshitidunno:0 "Supply And Logistics"
FLO_someshitidunno_desc:0 "It is said an army marches on its stomach. In addition, a modern army advances on its fuel tanks. As such we must always ensure our forces are well-supplied, so the needs of every soldier and machine are fulfilled. In addition, some griffons in the militia are engineers in civilian life. We should take advantage of their skills during war as well."
FLO_airplane_designs:0 "Aircraft Designs"
FLO_airplane_designs_desc:0 "True combined arms warfare requires control of the skies as well, with not just winged infantry but proper armoured planes. As such we must design fighters and bombers with the primary purpose of supporting the motorized infantry and tanks below them."
FLO_synth_experiments:0 "Synthetic Experiments"
FLO_synth_experiments_desc:0 "If the worst comes to pass, we must be able to rely on ourselves instead of distant foreigners. As such we should secure our own supply of fuel and rubber for our mechanized force. While we have no natural sources of those resources, technology and innovation will allow us to create them. Our chemists deserve all the support they need."
FLO_revolution_in_adelart:0 "Crimson Forests Of Adelart"
FLO_revolution_in_adelart_desc:0 "The locals of Adelart had to endure oppressive taxation for many years until they in desperation wished for bandits and vagabonds of the woods to save them, which they did. But they did not find true liberty, emancipation, equality or prosperity as they had hoped. All those things we shall now give them."
FLO_revolution_in_pomovarra:0 "Carmine Hills Of Pomovarra"
FLO_revolution_in_pomovarra_desc:0 "The natives of this city once called Pomovarra their fatherland, but with so many migrant workers now living here, few have any nationalistic sentiments towards it. But we do have proletarian sentiments, as the workers of Pomovarra suffer under a cruel yoke of capitalism. Therefore we must march across the rivers and save them!"
FLO_welcome_immigrants:0 "Welcome Immigrants"
FLO_welcome_immigrants_desc:0 "All workers are welcome here, no matter where they come from or what race they are. We will take care of them, happily accept them into our society and grant them citizenship. Word will spread and soon everycreature will be flocking to our little utopia."
FLO_ally_left:0 "Ally With The Left"
FLO_ally_left_desc:0 "While we are not ideologues or fanatics, we still share the same objectives as the many communists and socialists of the world: The emancipation of the working class. While there is little we can do to aid the global class struggle, we will still do it because anything is better than nothing."
FLO_military_airbase:0 "Build A Military Airbase"
FLO_military_airbase_desc:0 "Airplanes need an airport to operate out of, and as such we shall get to work and build a sizeable military airbase reserved for our militiagriff pilots. It will be large enough to house and supply hundreds of fighters and bombers and will serve us well for many years to come."
FLO_revolution_in_greifwald:0 "Scarlet Lake Of Falcontown"
FLO_revolution_in_greifwald_desc:0 "The despotic Counts of Greifwald never cared much for their commoner subjects. Their feudal reign must be crushed and the shackles of their servants and wage slaves broken!"
FLO_revolution_in_avian:0 "Maroon Fields Of Avian"
FLO_revolution_in_avian_desc:0 "Avian has traditionally been a country of landowners, where the aristocrat pigs dominate over their peasant underlings. The plight of the Avian workers will soon end, and we shall celebrate together and feast on local produce grown by the hard-working farmers."
FLO_revolution_in_erie:0 "Sanguine Castles Of Erie"
FLO_revolution_in_erie_desc:0 "The feudal lords of Erie care about nothing except their petty dispute with their cousins in Eyrie. Any complaints and calls for peace coming from the lower class are ignored as they sharpen their swords and prepare for bloodshed. The look on their faces will be a sight to behold as common workers of Flowena defeat their armies!"
FLO_call_for_freedom:0 "Call For Freedom"
FLO_call_for_freedom_desc:0 "We must take a more active stance in spreading word of our society, and how workers are happy here, free of oppression. Soon the working class of our neighbouring nations will desire to bring this bliss and liberty to their homeland, encouraged by our victorious revolution."
FLO_supply_revolution:0 "Support Revolutionaries"
FLO_supply_revolution_desc:0 "All the workers need are tools. And the tools of the revolution are weapons. These we shall make and then give in secret, smuggling them across the border. With shining new arms made by the finest gunsmith and powerful explosives, the workers become empowered, able to resist their oppressors."
FLO_international_cause:0 "The International Workers' Cause"
FLO_international_cause_desc:0 "Our militiagriffs wish to do more than just sit and wait for the enemy to come. They want to travel abroad and aid their fellow comrades in distant lands who are in dire need of their support. Not only shall we allow them, we will aid them wholeheartedly in their endeavours."
FLO_revolution_in_skyfall:0 "Vermillion Ports Of Skyfall"
FLO_revolution_in_skyfall_desc:0 "Skyfall and Flowena once had much in common. An obscenely rich upper class dedicated to capitalism, happily oppressing a vast and suffering lower class in the name of profit. But much has changed here, while Skyfall remains the same. It is time for us to become alike once more. The syndicates of Skyfall shall welcome us with open wings!"
FLO_found_faction:0 "Found The Workers' Confederation"
FLO_found_faction_desc:0 "So far our aid to our comrades has only been indirect. It is time we conduct braver foreign policy and seek even closer relations with fellow workers' states. An alliance shall be founded, a confederation of nations ready to face any dangers they face together."

FLO_a_swift_purge:0 "A Swift Purge"
FLO_a_swift_purge_desc:0 "In seizing a state, the attacker ought to examine closely all those injuries which are necessary, and to do them all at one stroke so as not to have to repeat them daily. Injuries ought to be done all at one time, so that, being tasted less, they offend less."
FLO_reward_loyal:0 "Reward The Loyal"
FLO_reward_loyal_desc:0 "To keep his servants honest the prince ought to reward them, honour them and enrich them. At the same time let them see that they cannot stand alone, so that many honours may not make them desire more, many riches make them wish for more, and that many problems may make them afraid to take chances."
FLO_fate_seigneurie:0 "The Fate Of The Seigneurie"
FLO_fate_seigneurie_desc:0 "A prince ought to leave affairs which may upset some to the management of others, and keep those which will make people happy in their own claws. Thus he should create a parliament which would be one that could beat down the great and favour the lesser without the prince being blamed."
FLO_aid_workers:0 "Aid The People"
FLO_aid_workers_desc:0 "One who becomes a prince through the favour of the people ought to keep them friendly. He can easily do this because they only ask not to be oppressed by him. In addition, those people who receive good from him of whom they were expecting evil become more closely bound to their protector. Let them therefore get free education and free gifts, all provided by their prince."
FLO_the_prince:0 "The Prince"
FLO_the_prince_desc:0 "With his foundations secure, it is time for Nicolas to step forth and officially reclaim his family's royal title of Prince. His reign shall herald the coming of a new age to Flowena, an age of strength, unity and order."
FLO_virtue:0 "Virtue"
FLO_virtue_desc:0 "The chief foundations of all states are good laws and good arms. A wise prince ought to adopt such a course that his citizens will always in all kinds of circumstances have need of the state and of him, and then he will always find them faithful. With justice, generosity and virtuous laws, this can be accomplished, and the loyalty of the people secured."
FLO_fortune:0 "Fortune"
FLO_fortune_desc:0 "The chief foundations of all states are good laws and good arms. A griffon who wishes to act entirely in a virtuous way is soon destroyed among so much that is evil in the world. Hence a prince who wishes to survive must know how to do wrong, and how to do or not do wrong according to necessity. When fortune provides opportunities to break your enemies, you must seize them without hesitation."
FLO_bonfire_of_vanities:0 "Bonfire Of Vanities"
FLO_bonfire_of_vanities_desc:0 "Textiles, perfumes, flowers... all these are worthless things for they do not satisfy the needs of the people nor do they strengthen the state. They only serve to enrich the greedy, and a wise prince should never allow any of his subjects to become too great in wealth, lest they threaten his position. Thus the useless vanities must be purged."
FLO_protector_of_people:0 "Protector Of The People"
FLO_protector_of_people_desc:0 "Let the people be reminded that the only one who can defend them from the patricians and their abuses is the prince. But a wise prince ought to take care of the patricians as well, for they can be useful, but not so much as to make himself hated by the people. This way the prince ensures that both the people and the patricians rely on him and trust him."
FLO_art_of_war:0 "The Art Of War"
FLO_art_of_war_desc:0 "A prince ought to have no other aim or thought, nor select anything else for his study, than war and its rules and discipline. This is the sole art that belongs to him who rules. A prince who does not understand the art of war cannot be respected by his soldiers, nor can he rely on them."
FLO_fox_and_lion:0 "The Fox And The Lion"
FLO_fox_and_lion_desc:0 "A prince, being forced knowingly to adopt the beast, ought to choose the fox and the lion; because the lion cannot defend himself against traps and the fox cannot defend himself against wolves. Therefore, it is necessary to be a fox to discover the traps and a lion to frighten the wolves."
FLO_control_economy:0 "Control The Economy"
FLO_control_economy_desc:0 "The fluctuations of a free market and the misguided management of incompetent servants both fail to fulfill a prince's demands. Thus he must assume direct control of production, dictating what needs to be done. With his wise leadership, every worthwhile demand will soon be supplied most generously."
FLO_honour_the_skilled:0 "Support The Workers"
FLO_honour_the_skilled_desc:0 "A prince should encourage his citizens to perform their jobs peacefully, so that people are not worried about increasing their possessions for fear that they might be taken away from them. As every city is divided into tradesgriff's organisations or into societies, he ought to respect such groups, and associate with them sometimes."
FLO_poverty_vice:0 "Poverty Is Not A Vice"
FLO_poverty_vice_desc:0 "The most useful thing that may be ordered in a free way of life is that the citizens be kept poor. As they cannot afford to buy useless things, industry may focus on arms, and by providing good salaries for soldiers the poor will flock to join the military."
FLO_ignorance_bliss:0 "Ignorance Is Bliss"
FLO_ignorance_bliss_desc:0 "Knowledge can be harmful. In the good old days, the commoners were content with their position and made no effort to overthrow their rightful rulers, but as they became increasingly literate, aware and conscious of their situation they discovered radical ideas. By limiting knowledge, this danger can be contained, and the people fooled more easily."
FLO_citizen_army:0 "A Citizen Army"
FLO_citizen_army_desc:0 "Mercenaries and auxiliaries are useless and dangerous. In peace one is robbed by them, and in war by the enemy. A wise prince has always avoided these types of soldiers and used his own, making laws to draft citizens into a loyal army. He has been willing to lose with his own soldiers rather than to conquer with others. A real victory is not gained with the arms of others."
FLO_arm_the_people:0 "Arm The People"
FLO_arm_the_people_desc:0 "For among other evils which being unarmed brings you, it causes you to be despised. Hence there never was a new prince who has disarmed his subjects. Rather, when he has found them disarmed, he has always armed them. By arming them, those arms become yours, those who were distrusted become faithful, and those who were faithful are kept so, and your subjects become your supporters."
FLO_advance_on_adelart:0 "Advance On Adelart"
FLO_advance_on_adelart_desc:0 "Adelart is a rogue province, controlled by illegitimate rebels and bandits. They have no right no rule and they know it. The Count of Greifwald claims their lands, but our ruler is a Prince, above his lowly rank. He if anyone should be the new, more benevolent master of Adelart."
FLO_pounce_on_pomovarra:0 "Pounce On Pomovarra"
FLO_pounce_on_pomovarra_desc:0 "The occupation by foreigners and the misguided resistance of the peasants in Pomovarra have to both end. Not only does the Prince have a dynastic claim on the land, but he intends to restore order there, which is the most just cause for conquest."
FLO_forges_of_war:0 "Forges Of War"
FLO_forges_of_war_desc:0 "A prince should always strive to be self-reliant, and utilize arms of his own instead of the arms of others. Thus he must keep in mind that the primary purpose of industry is to supply his soldiers, so they have all they need to accomplish their goals."
FLO_coal_plant:0 "Coal Power Plant"
FLO_coal_plant_desc:0 "Machines of modernity need a more potent source of power than mere waterwheels. Coal is their primary fuel, and an ample supply can be cheaply secured from Westkeep. While it will tarnish the air, the benefits greatly outweight this minor inconvenience."
FLO_military_institute:0 "Institute of Military Science"
FLO_military_institute_desc:0 "Like many other things, war too is a discipline and a science that can be studied and refined. For this purpose an educational institute must be established, serving the dual purpose of training officers and innovating new military tactics and strategies."
FLO_generous_prince:0 "A Generous Prince"
FLO_generous_prince_desc:0 "A prince should show himself to be an example of good behaviour and generosity, but maintain awareness of his high rank. He exercises generosity towards all from whom he does not take, who are many, and meanness towards those to whom he does not give, who are few. It does not take away a prince's reputation if he wastes what belonged to others."
FLO_pious_prince:0 "A Pious Prince"

### Events

flowena.1.t:0 "The Mayor's Speech"
flowena.1.d:0 "As news spread about the mayor's speech where he would announce something very important, even the commoners were interested. When the day of the speech finally came, thousands of griffons filled the snowy Cherryblossom Square in front of the city hall, which was rather ironically known as the People's Palace. Patricians stood on balconies around the plaza, above the teeming crowd of poorly dressed commonfolk. Chatter filled the chill air as everyone wondered what Mayor Chocolat wished to tell them all.\n\nFinally he appeared, coming out of the Palace. A podium and a microphone had been prepared for him and expensive loudspeakers imported from Equestria ensured everygriff could hear him clearly. The crowd went silent as the mayor approached the podium, waved to the crowd happily and loudly cleared his throat.\n\n"My fellow free citizens of Flowena! Today is a truly grand day. For today I will begin to fulfill my New Year's Resolution! What is it, I hear you ask? Well curious griffons, I promised that I would make my father -- may he rest in peace -- proud of me at last and do what he always wish for me to do: govern the city and be a good leader for my citizens! I will fix all the problems in our fair and gorgeous home and make it the shining jewel of Griffonia, surpassing Romau in its glory! You can trust me to do a great job as I have learned much from my wise father who ruled this city wisely. That means I am wise as well! So yes, no more parties for poor Chocolat. I will get to work tomorrow, or possibly some days later. Rejoice! A new golden age begins now!"\n\nChocolat clearly expected the crowd to erupt in enthusiastic cheers and praise, but instead most griffons looked at him hesitantly and quietly. Chocolat's smile wavered, so he started clapping, hoping the crowd to follow his example.\n\nThey did not."
flowena.1.a:0 "This is clearly a good start..."

flowena.2.t:0 "The Mayor's Economic Miracle"
flowena.2.d:0 "After several weeks of hard work at the People's Palace, as well as several small-scale mostly private parties, Chocolat finished his new "Mayor's Economic Miracle"-program which was swiftly approved and officialized by other members of the ruling council, the Seigneurie. It greatly reduced taxes for patricians and members of the government while greatly increasing them for the lower class. He said this was "trickle-down theory" in practice: Low taxes on the upper class would enable them to invest large sums into the economy and increase its growth, thus creating new jobs as companies, mills and manufactories expanded. However funds would still be needed to cover expenses while the economy grew, so the poor would now pay more taxes for the free public services they already received.\n\nIt did not take long for several hundred commoner families to fall into poverty and for woolworkers to protest on the streets, waving red banners. In the meantime patricians thanked Chocolat and invited him to parties which were better than ever thanks to their increased funds."
flowena.2.a:0 "Oh no..."

flowena.3.t:0 "The Mayor's Enlightenment of Flowena"
flowena.3.d:0 "Chocolat's father, Bronzino, was a great patron of the arts and sciences and the mayor aspired to be just like him. He invited several hundred promising individuals from all across western Griffonia into Flowena, trying to find as many savants as possible. Of course, he didn't have time to check how many of them were frauds or eccentric individuals. Soon a pile of garbage was placed in the People's Palace, made by the "great maestro Donat" that "represented the inner rot of griffonkind". Cleaning the mess cost several thousand flowins.\n\nChocolat also intended to increase the number of teachers and thus put some of the foreigners to work as well as hiring as many new educators as possible. Their qualifications were often non-existent and countless young griffons were taught complete nonsense or nothing at all as their teachers took naps during class."
flowena.3.a:0 "That cursed fool!"

flowena.4.t:0 "The Mayor's Mighty Army"
flowena.4.d:0 "The city's militia was small but well-drilled. It was lead by competent Captains such as Nicolas de Charbon and Astrit Koch, the latter of which was a renowned former mercenary from Herzland. But Mayor Chocolat wanted it to make it larger and more professional, with full-time soldiers. Nicolas warned him of how difficult and expensive that would be but he cared little, saying how he had inherited his father's wisdom and knew exactly what he was doing.\n\nHe appointed the famed Laurent the Old as supreme leader of the militia. The griffon had long been a friend of his family and was famous for defending the city during the chaos of the Empire's collapse, but was now over eighty years old. Chocolat assured everyone Laurent had lost none of his talents over the years and continued to reform training programs, making them extremely rigorous. He also proposed reduced pay for militiagriffs so the expansion of the army could be afforded, and the Seigneurie gladly let him reduce governmental expenses. Several thousand griffons ended up resigning as a result of these reforms, among them dozens of skilled officers."
flowena.4.a:0 "What is he even doing?!"

flowena.5.t:0 "Poverty Rates Increase"
flowena.5.d:0 "It seems our mayor's economic program is nowhere near as successful as he had hoped. Instead of reinvesting their money back into the economy, the patricians are either spending it on lavish parties or storing it safely in their banks. The Flowenian economy is beginning to show signs of stagnation as many common workers are unable to afford anything because of the high taxes. Unrest is slowly growing and some families are teetering on the edge of starvation."
flowena.5.a:0 "Terrible news."

flowena.6.t:0 "Illiteracy Rates Increase"
flowena.6.d:0 "Despite our schools having more teachers than ever, illiteracy rates are growing according to a recent survey. The students have received small amounts of poor education and they struggle comprehending even basic texts. At this rate many of them will have trouble graduating. Old teachers demand that the mayor sacks the horribly incompetent new teachers, but Chocolat called them jealous and said everything was their fault. As a result many of our best teachers have resigned."
flowena.6.a:0 "It only gets worse!"

flowena.7.t:0 "The Mayor's Magnificent Project"
flowena.7.d:0 "After the mayor finally arrived at the People's Palace, several hours late to the meeting, architects presented two construction project proposals to the Seigneurie. The first one was tearing down rat-infested slums on the western edge of the city and building new, high-quality housing in their place that even the labourers could afford. This would also remove the health problem in the area caused by the ever-growing rat population. The other proposal was renovating the city's old fortifications which have crumbled over the years, because Bronzino believed fortifications were outdated in the age of modern warfare. The architects themselves told the council that the fortification renovation was less important and could be postponed for later.\n\nHowever, the mayor did not wish to destroy the ramshackle houses which the poor had built for themselves with hard work. Instead, he believed renovating the historical defences would be very beneficial and ensure the safety of the city as well as maintain our historical heritage. The Seigneurie trusted his wisdom, so the architects nodded and hesitantly got to work."
flowena.7.a:0 "This can only end badly..."

flowena.8.t:0 "The Mayor of Flowena Visits Us"
flowena.8.d:0 "Today the mayor of the city-state on our border, Chocolat de Rosebrune, arrived on a diplomatic visit, escorted by loyal militiagriffs. He had sent invitations to the leaders of the rebels as well, wishing to bring them to the negotiating table with us. He did not ask for our consent and neither did he inform us of this, so when the rebels approached the capital our soldiers opened fire on them.\n\nWhile there were no casualties and the misunderstanding was cleared up soon after, it was a poor start for the negotiations that ruined the mood and sowed distrust among us. Harmann Camriz and Olivier Morel did not arrive in person either, having sent representatives to speak on their behalf. Clearly they refused to trust us in the slightest.\n\nSoon after everyone had gathered around the negotiating table, Chocolat began to speak. Then ramble. He kept blabbering empty platitudes and made empty promises of peace between the three factions, while clearly having no idea why the conflict had begun in the first place. After an hour of flowery talking, the rebel delegates grew tired and marched out of the room, claiming that this had merely been a distraction, or even a trap for their leaders that they had been too clever to fall into, and that Chocolat was our ally.\n\nChocolat struggled to respond to these accusations and failed to entice the rebels to return. Soon after leaving, we even discovered that the rebel delegates had sabotaged our armouries and set them on fire! When Chocolat meekly asked us to recognise their independence, our response was short."
flowena.8.a:0 ""You only made things worse! Get out!""

flowena.9.t:0 "The Mayor's Masterful Negotiation"
flowena.9.d:0 "Our mayor has now returned from his journey to Pomovarra. His facial expression already told everything one needed to know: It had gone horribly wrong. Indeed, the Pomovarrans had been thoroughly insulted and our relations have been ruined for now. It will take great diplomatic effort to repair the damage done. Some even fear that Pomovarra might begin an armed conflict with us."
flowena.9.a:0 "How is he such a failure?"

flowena.10.t:0 "Mass Strike!"
flowena.10.d:0 "Discontent among the lower class finally reached a boiling point today as tens of thousands of woolworkers, botanists, craftsgriffs, gardeners, teachers, cleaners and more refused to work and instead marched on the streets, waving protest signs and shouting angry slogans. They demanded better rights, better pay, better education, expansion of guild membership so even common labourers could join them and, above all, the resignation of Mayor Chocolat. Militiagriffs were ordered to stop the protests and put the commoners back to work, but they refused to obey and sat at the barracks.\n\nAs the Cherryblossom Square filled to the brim with furious griffons, Chocolat panicked inside the People's Palace. Soon he ran outside and spoke to the crowd, begging for them to calm down. He promised expansive reforms and was willing to fulfill all their demands. When the patricians of the city heard of this, they were outraged. Anna of House de Indigo managed to talk some sense to them and said the workers' demands were perfectly reasonable. Chocolat was confused because the de Indigo were bitter rivals of his family, but naïvely thanked her nevertheless.\n\nOver the following days Chocolat met and negotiated with dozens of worker representatives, one of the more prominent ones being Michael Landreau, a common woolcomber and former militiagriff who was filled with determination and charisma. However, the talks resulted in little more than promises of change. Eventually the workers calmed down and went back to work, having decided to give Chocolat one last chance to fix things."
flowena.10.a:0 "Does he even deserve a chance?"

flowena.11.t:0 "A Feast In The Plague"
flowena.11.d:0 "Mayor Chocolat had grand plans for the party. It would be a massive feast, with all kinds of cuisine from all across the world, from Griffonia and Equestria and Zebrica, and there would be performers entertaining everyone with stunning acts, and great music, and games for all ages so even the children could have a good time, and great atmosphere that would make everyone feel happy. And he would invite Pinkie Pie from Equestria to help him and ensure it would truly be great!\n\nThen the plague struck.\n\nIt began in the western borough, where the largest slums were located. They had suffered from an infestation of black rats for a long time, and now these rats were blamed for the outbreak. From west it quickly spread to the commercial northern borough and the industrial southern borough before reaching the city centre in the east, where the patricians' manors and the great bridges were located. At first several hundred griffons fell ill and were incapacitated before they suffocated in their own bodily fluids. Several days later thousands of griffons were sick, then tens of thousands as the disease spread like wildfire. It cared little for class and infected patricians and commoners alike. Many were dying every day and priests were busy performing burial rites for all the dead. Graveyards across the city began to fill and soon enough graves were dug in the city's gardens. Some said Maar Himself was punishing the citizens for their sins.\n\nChocolat did not cancel his grand party. Instead, he downscaled it (mostly because of lack of funds) and moved it outside the city, to a deserted villa near the border with Pomovarra. Every participant told stories in turn, with one being chosen as the King or Queen of the party and choosing the theme of the tale being told. Patricians who participated enjoyed it and thought it was a pleasant break from the horrors in the city."
flowena.11.a:0 "Sacre Bleu!"

flowena.12.t:0 "The Last de Charbon"
flowena.12.d:0 "As soon as he heard the news, militia commander Nicolas de Charbon abandoned his post and rushed to his small and derelict family manor, flying above the disease-ridden city. As he hurriedly entered, the door's rusty hinges finally gave in and it fell on the floor, but Nicolas cared little and ran upstairs, pushing aside the few servants his family had. But by the time he burst into his father's bedroom, it was already too late.\n\nThe elderly griffon lied still on his bed, eyes open and staring into nothingness. Viscous liquid dripped out of his open beak, a sign of the dreaded Wet Plague. A mourning servant and a doctor, both wearing face masks, sat beside him and turned to look at Nicolas. He was frozen in shock. The plague truly was merciless especially upon the older griffons, killing them within hours. The news had come too late and now he would never know his father's final words.\n\nHe came to a terrible realization that he was now alone, the last member of de Charbon family. Once, they had been Princes of Pomovarra and overlords of Flowena, but had been reduced to almost nothing over the centuries. He suddenly felt the weight of a hundred generations upon his shoulders and the judging gaze of a thousand ancestors piercing his body. The responsibilty to keep his bloodline going was now entirely his, and so was restoring his family to its former glory if he so desired.\n\nBut should he really gamble it all and take such a risk? It would be safer to simply continue his humble duty as the commander of the militia, find some patrician chick to marry and bear as many children as possible, so the dynasty would survive, content with its modest existence. But perhaps it is better to be bold than cautious, and take advantage of the chaos in the city to make everyone once again know and fear the name of de Charbon."
flowena.12.a:0 "I will continue to loyally serve my home city."
flowena.12.b:0 "I'm not interested in preserving the status quo; I want to overthrow it."

flowena.13.t:0 "Quarantine"
flowena.13.d:0 "Today the mayor ordered all gates, bridges and roads of Flowena to be shut: Not a single soul would be allowed to enter or leave. This is what Flowena had always done during epidemics of the past. What the Mayor failed to understand was the reason for this action. It was meant to prevent disease from spreading into the city, but now the quarantine kept disease inside the city. This did mean that Pomovarra, Adelart and Avian were all spared from the illness, but the same could not be said for Flowena. The plague continued to pick up speed and griffons died in droves. The streets were soon filled with decaying corpses and the fragrance of flowers was replaced with the vile stench of death. In sorrow, the Mayor cancelled his ambitious renovation projects as most of the workers were infected."
flowena.13.a:0 "Boreas save us..."

flowena.14.t:0 "The Cats Are Set Loose"
flowena.14.d:0 "Militiagriffs, led by Astrit Koch, spent all day gathering stray cats and confiscating pets. Once several hundred had been caught, they were brought into the western borough and released. This was entirely Mayor Chocolat's idea, as he had been told that rats were likely the cause of the plague. The cats went out into the houses to feed on the vermin and did indeed catch many of them, but then the cats themselves got sick and died in droves. One dead cat was studied further by doctors who found several small fleas from its fur. Later they caught a rat and found the exact same parasites. Shortly before falling ill themselves, they formulated a theory that the disease was spread by the fleas.\n\nSome of the militiagriffs including Astrit fell ill and died some days later, and a few cats found their way back to their owners and infected them too."
flowena.14.a:0 "Death, death everywhere..."

flowena.15.t:0 "Flowena Burns"
flowena.15.d:0 "In the People's Palace, the mayor was close to a nervous breakdown. His actions had accomplished nothing, and his citizens were perishing by the thousands. This is not what he wanted. He had finally decided to change his life for the better and become a true successor for his father, which is what Bronzino had always wanted. But he had failed.\n\nOr had he?\n\nA spark of insanity lit in his eyes and he ran to the kitchen near the dining hall, grabbed a flask of oil and some firestarters near the oven, then flew outside, all the way to the western borough. As he flew he sprayed oil all around him, cackling madly and cursing the plague, then landed and used the tinderbox to start fires in multiple locations. Any witnesses thought they were suffering from delirium caused by the disease and ignored him until it was too late and the fires spread.\n\nSoon enough the entire borough and all its rickety wooden houses were aflame, burning brightly as night fell. Those griffons who were not yet ill fled in terror and flew away, leaving behind their sickly loved ones to perish. The mayor witnessed this from afar, smiling at first and then breaking down into tears.\n\nOn the next day, the spread of both the fire and the plague finally slowed down. Brave firefighters had prevented the fire from spreading to the many gardens and Eyr blessed the city with rain that helped them to quench the flames. A quarter of the city had been utterly destroyed but the rat population had died with it, and as the infected perished the epidemic lost all its momentum. It was finally over a week later."
flowena.15.a:0 "..."

flowena.16.t:0 "A Brother's Return"
flowena.16.d:0 "In Middenheim, the news never spoke of Mayor Chocolat's new year's resolution. The students of its University of Economics paid no attention to it, and thus Bruno de Rosebrune, Chocolat's brother, did not know what had happened until it was too late. The realization came to him when his fellow students jokingly said that Flowena proved trickle-down economy was nothing more than pure bogus. But even then he remained in Middenheim, refusing to abandon his studies, yet increasingly nervous about what his older brother was doing.\n\nThen came the news of the plague epidemic and the great fire. Chocolat had become laughingstock of Griffonia. Bruno decided to leave with haste and took the first available train to Romau, then returned to his home city along the river Erne on a ferry. When he finally arrived, he was shaken to the core.\n\nThe smell of death and burnt wood permeated the city. Anonymous bodybags remained stacked on the streets, waiting to be buried while their contents rotted. Shaken and traumatized griffons begged for food and coin. Everyone averted his gaze, even familiar patricians who knew him.\n\nHe flew with all haste to the family manor, which had once been the party capital of the city but was now dead silent. The servants of his family were surprised to see him and welcomed him, but instead of greeting them Bruno fervently asked where his brother was.\n\nInside, in his room, locked inside. Refused to open the door. Sounded like he did nothing but sob and rant by himself.\n\nBruno, filled with worry, ran upstairs and banged on the door of his brother's room."
flowena.16.a:0 ""Leave me alone!""
flowena.16.b:0 "..."

flowena.17.t:0 "Brotherly Reason"
flowena.17.d:0 ""I said, leave me alone!" shouted Chocolat, his voice cracking. "How many times have I got to tell you idiots that I don't want to be disturbed?!"\n"Chocolat, it's me, Bruno. Your brother."\nSilence. Then, the door opened. Chocolat stood there, starting at his sibling in surprise. He was haggard, appeared skinnier than before and had clearly not slept for days. A half-empty bottle of Skyfall whiskey was in his claws and the floor of his room was littered with feathers.\n"What in the name of the Three Gods happened here?!" Bruno asked. "Trickle-down economy, plague, fire... Did you summon Maar himself or what?"\nChocolat looked down and for a while did not answer. Then, silently he said: "I failed. Many times. Because I am a failure." He lied down on the floor and drank some whiskey.\n"And what made you fail? When I left, things were going well! You were having fun parties and the Seigneurie ran the city just fine."\n"I... I realized last year that if my father was alive, he'd be disappointed in me. I've done nothing to make him proud, yet he always believed in me. Turns out he never should've. Bloody Tartarus."\nBruno sighed deeply and covered his eyes with his claws. "I should've known this would happen. Our father pampered you too much and never taught you how to actually rule. You were his favourite."\nChocolat somberly nodded, then rose up, his eyes wide open. "You! You should've inherited his position, not me! Who cares if I am older than you, you would've been better for this city! Heck, you know what, I'll resign! Fix my mess while I go hide somewhere far away in shame! I-I beg you!"\nBruno was taken by surprise, but he did not reject the idea at first. For a while he pondered, then responded:"
flowena.17.a:0 ""Fine. I'll do it.""
flowena.17.b:0 ""I am here to help you, not to replace you.""

flowena.18.t:0 "The Sortition"
flowena.18.d:0 "As news spread of Chocolat's resignation, griffons rejoiced and celebrated on the streets and in the sky. An impromptu firework display was even held at Cherryblossom Square. Meanwhile in the People's Palace the patricians prepared for an early sortition, a random lottery traditionally used to choose who would gain a position on the ruling council, the Seigneurie. The sortitions were originally intended to prevent factionalism, populism and conflict and had worked wonderfully, but over the years the results had become predictable as patricians agreed in advance who would gain which position and rigged the sortitions. Bronzino the Magnificent's name ended up being pulled every year for several decades and Chocolat was the "lucky" griffon three years in a row.\n\nNevertheless sortition was tradition at this point and the patricians proceeded with it like always, ignoring the usual grumbles of Anna de Indigo and her family who had always been proponents of democracy. Twelve names were written on pieces of paper, then placed in a bag. A commoner was invited to draw a name and read it out loud in front of the awaiting crowd outside the People's Palace. The commoners knew it was all rigged, but did not care as long as anyone besides Chocolat would become the new mayor.\n\nThe former mayor himself was nowhere to be seen, but his brother knew he was safe, far away from home."

The workers had once again been betrayed by the patricians who had failed to make Chocolat retire and bring the change they had promised. This was the last straw and the end of the old order had to come with violence!\n\nGriffons flew up to balconies of manors and broke inside, looting and burning the luxurious homes of the patricians. The merchants themselves were captured, their fabulous clothes torn off and burned. Militiagriffs joined the rioters and arrested or shot those few who remained loyal to their paymasters, who weren't paying much anyways. The People's Palace was stormed as the people claimed what was rightfully theirs. The members of the Seigneurie were dragged outside and beaten, and Chocolat himself was taken to the roof and hanged from the flagpole on top. Bruno wailed and mourned, then attacked nearby workers and tore their faces with his claws before being knocked unconcious with a gunstock. Alongside Chocolat's corpse Michael Landreau, the leader of the workers, hoisted the red flag of the revolution.\n\nA new age would begin in Flowena. The decadence and oppression had finally come to an end."

The Seigneurie declared this day to be a day of mourning and the city dedicated ten minutes of silence to him at six o'clock. Banners of the city were held at half-mast. The priests began to arrange his burial in the tombs of the Temple of Arcturius while the mayor promised that a statue depicting him would be raised in his honour.\n\nLaurent had commanded the city's militia during the tumultuous years of the Aquileian Revolution, when the entire nation had been in chaos. Under his masterful leadership the garrison held the forces of Pomovarra at bay and five years later repelled a large invading force from the restored Kingdom of Aquileia. His heroic acts and ingenius strategies ensured the freedom and independence of our beautiful city."

When questioned by our officials, he said he moved to Skyfall solely because of the whiskey which he greatly enjoyed. He said he was planning to apply for citizenship and buy a manor in the outskirts of Skyfall, where he would hold many parties.

flowena.31.t:0 "Bruno Gets To Work"
flowena.31.d:0 "Unlike his older brother, Bruno de Rosebrune did not hold an opulent inauguration party after becoming the mayor. Instead, he locked himself up in his office in the People's Palace and started drafting countless legal documents, only occasionally leaving the room to get food and ask members of the Judges' Guild for advice. He worked day and night, consuming copious amounts of coffee from Macawia, and in the process undid almost everything his brother had done.\n\nWeeks later he finally finished his work and presented his work to the Seigneurie, whose members were impressed and rejoiced. Gone were the misguided economic policies, the botched militia reform and the failed education reform. Any signs of the generous labour laws that Chocolat had hastily prepared before the Plague were gone. These laws soon came into effect. The commoners, however, were nowhere near as satisfied as the upper class griffons. It seemed more work needed to be done to ensure stability in Flowena..."

flowena.32.t:0 "The Reconstruction"
flowena.32.d:0 "The western borough had for decades been a labyrinth of slums, where the poor workers of the city dwelled. For years there had been plans to demolish it all and build something more civilized instead, yet they were never put into effect. Until now, of course, as the Great Fire conveniently destroyed every shack in the area.\n\nBruno arrived at the meeting with the architects perfectly in time, and together with the Seigneurie they eagerly discussed what to build. Alongside the initial plan of building affordable housing, the architects proposed expanding the southern industrial district and building new textile mills, or alternatively creating a dedicated district for arms production."

flowena.33.d:0 "Today Bruno met with the Seigneurie and discussed the possibilty of sending an offer to the wayward land of Adelart. The area has very large deposits of oil underground, but oil drilling operations are nowhere near as expansive as they could be, primarily because the rogue state lacks capital funds. Bruno suggested they could all invest in Adelart in exchange for a share of the profits gained from selling the petroleum.\n\nHowever, that wasn't the only idea he had in mind. Greifwald has no desire to recognize their independence, just like Pomovarra refuses to recognize our own. It is clear Adelart wishes to find an ally to aid them, and we could be such an ally. On one condition however: They give us complete control of half their oil production.\n\nIt was up to the patricians of the council to decide what kind of offer Adelart would receive."

They said Flowena, as a fellow nation that had freed itself from feudal oppression, offered to guarantee our independence and hire mercenaries to defend us if we were ever attacked. In return, however, they requested payment. When [Root.GetLeader] asked them to elaborate, they said their employers did not wish gold, but black gold. The patricians desired control of half of our oil drilling operations.\n\nIt would be a heavy price to pay, but perhaps it would be worth it?"

flowena.39.d:0 "For generations now the Houses of de Rosebrune and de Indigo have been bitter rivals, constantly conspiring and overthrowing one another. De Rosebrune were traditionally allies of the patricians while de Indigo built their powerbase on the common griffons, so in a way the rivalry between the two families mirrored the relations between the upper and lower classes of the city. So perhaps the surprising marriage proposal represented the rift between classes finally being mended.\n\nBruno and Anna were both young and unmarried, but did not know each other personally. Bruno had always been reclusive and spent many years studying abroad, and even after returning he had met Anna once or twice. It quickly became clear to many that this marriage was purely a political one, made out of practical concerns. The patricians had turned their backs on the House of de Rosebrune, but now that the family allied itself with the House of de Indigo, it solidified the commoners as their supporters. The patricians would be powerless against him, for if they wanted to remove him and his relatives from power, they would invoke the wrath of the people.\n\nThe marriage ceremony was held in the small Temple of Eyr near the city center, and was a grand spectacle with thousands of spectators, numerous performers and a huge, opulent feast. Yet for Bruno and Anna, it was a quick and formal affair, and they went through the motions of the marriage rituals without any feelings for one another. Nevertheless the populace loved it, and as a result they loved Bruno and his rule as well."

De Rosebrune were traditionally allies of the patricians while de Indigo built their powerbase on the common griffons, so in a way the rivalry between the two families mirrored the relations between the upper and lower classes of the city. So perhaps the recent series of deaths represented the patricians finally getting the upper claw and crushing their foes.\n\nIt began with a freak accident where Jacques the Indigo, Anna's cousin, fell backwards on a knife three times. Some days later, Genevieve was shot by a militiagriff during shooting practice. Then Cedric fell down the stairs and was shot after the landed on the floor.\n\nThe militia sacked the griffon responsible for killing Genevieve, but did not punish him more, claiming it had been a pure accident. The Judges' Guild then promised to investigate the mysterious deaths of members of the de Indigo family, but ended up doing very little, if nothing. All their members were patricians, of course.\n\nAnna de Indigo and her remaining relatives quickly realized what was happening. All the patricians in the city had turned against them and hired assassins to kill off her entire family. It did not take long for her to flee the city, perhaps forever.

I wanted to tell something to you."\n"And who are you?" Bruno asked, annoyed that he could not get to work before she moved out of the way.\nShe laughed in response. "One of the few griffons in Flowena who doesn't recognize me. I am Anna de Indigo."\nAs soon as Bruno heard the name of the rival family, he squinted his eyes. "And what do you want to say?"\nShe placed her claw on his shoulder. "I wanted to say that you are not what I expected. It seems all the time you spent away from your family turned you into a decent person. I wanted to thank you for what you have already done for the poor commoners of our fair city."\nBruno raised an eyebrow. "Well, you are welcome. I personally believe exploiting the workers is bad for the economy in the long run. Now if you excuse me, I have work to do."\n\nAnna chuckled. "Very well, then.

They were all suspected of preparing a violent coup to oust Bruno and his family. Evidence has already been found that proves them to be guilty: documents, notes and letters all revealing extensive communication and planning between the conspirators. One of the plotters had belong to the de Indigo family, but he was not arrested as he had been the whistleblower in the first place. He said that after Bruno's recent reforms he saw no reason to depose him and revealed the conspiracy to the militia. Bruno has now pardoned him and thanked him for potentially saving his life."

Remember that oppressing the people has a cost, which will be paid one day with high interest."\nBruno blinked in both surprise and confusion, then frowned. "I see, once again de Indigo try to tell us how to run the city, as if they knew anything about basic economics. I'm sure if you were the mayor, you'd be even worse than my brother!"\n\nAnna gasped, then slapped his other cheek. "Very well then. If conflict is what you desire, conflict you shall receive."\nShe turned her back on him, whipped his face with her tail and left, head held high."

flowena.44.t:0 "Cherryblossom Square Massacre"
flowena.44.d:0 "About a week ago small-scale protests began, held at the Cherryblossom Square. As days passed they swelled in size, ultimately gathering tens of thousands of commoners together to demonstrate peacefully. Some griffons in the crowd waved flags of the Griffonian Republic and others held placards demanding more rights and liberty. A few griffons even flew atop the People's Palace and tore down the city's flag. The demonstrations were not violent and citizens simply expressed their frustrations with recent reforms.\n\nHowever, Bruno saw them as a political threat. He convinced the Seigneurie and other patricians that it was all a plot by the de Indigo family, who wished to incite and uprising and take control of the city. Clearly their devious plans had to be foiled before it was too late! Therefore the militia was summoned and ordered to retake the Square from the people. Nicolas de Charbon refused at first, saying it was unwise to use force against the common griffons, but Bruno reminded him and any other hesitant militiagriffs about who paid their salaries. Nicolas nodded grimly and got to work.\n\nMartial law was declared and organized columns of militia surrounded the protesters, both in the streets and above in the sky. They began pushing back griffons and beating those who stood in their way, and as the commoners refused to listen to reason, soon opened fire on them. Hundreds fled but others fought back, using stones and bricks and setting buildings on fire. Yet they could do little against armed and trained militiagriffs marching or flying in formation and only caused light casualties. The number of dead civilians continued to rise until the evening when the gunshots finally ended. The Square had been cleared of protesters and the city was safe from revolution, while hospitals filled with the dead and dying."

Indeed, several days later they were demolished, destroyed in controlled explosions one after another. The Old Bridge, the Orchid Bridge and the Hyacinth Bridge were among the most notable ones, having been built by the Mason's Guild several centuries ago and featuring beautiful statues, arches and intricately decorated pillars. Some griffons witnessing the demolitions openly wept and wailed. The patricians on the other claw calculated how much they would profit once the new bridges were complete."

The envoys said all this was a gift for us, intended to show that Flowena wished to develop our relationship and bring an end to any disputes between us.

flowena.58.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] Refused"
flowena.58.d:0 "Our diplomats have come back from their trip to [From.Capital.GetName] with sorrowful faces. They have refused to ensure our liberty and protect us from foreign aggression, claiming that it would not be worth the effort and cost. We cannot deny that there is some truth in that...\n\nNevertheless, we must ready our defences for we are on our own."
flowena.58.a:0 "Perhaps we asked for too much..."

flowena.59.t:0 "Flowena Provides Mercenaries"
flowena.59.d:0 "A ragtag bunch of heavily armed Herzlander soldiers crossed our border today, but it was not an invasion from the Empire. Rather, they were mercenaries hired by Flowena to fight for us. Emissaries from the city-state have told us they will take care of paying their salaries, so all we have to do is give them orders."
flowena.59.a:0 "How generous of you."

flowena.60.t:0 "Flowena Proposes An Alliance"
flowena.60.d:0 "For a long time now the city-state of Flowena has sought closer relations with us by investing in our economy and fostering trade between our two nations. Today they sent emissaries to finally formalize this friendship and make it into a proper alliance. Any barriers remaining between us would be torn down and our economies would be united into one. We would vow to protect each other from any external threat and exchange military intelligence.\n\nWhile they seem optimistic that we will accept their proposal, should Skyfall bother allying with such minor powers? Or should we aid our fellow merchants and build a golden future together?"
flowena.60.a:0 "We will stand together."
flowena.60.b:0 "Ignore them."

flowena.61.t:0 "Our Dreams Realized"
flowena.61.d:0 "Skyfall has officially accepted our offer of friendship and an alliance has been formed between our two nations! Many trade agreements were also made which will unite our economies into one. We are no longer alone, stranded among rural and backward nations, but have joined a powerful coalition of wealthy cities. Our future truly shines golden before our eyes."
flowena.61.a:0 "Tonight we celebrate!"

flowena.62.t:0 "Our Dreams Crushed"
flowena.62.d:0 "[From.GetNameDef] did not reject our offer of friendship.\n\nIn fact, they never responded to it at all.\n\nOur diplomats were ignored, told that [From.GetLeader] was too busy and their meeting had been postponed, again and again. Eventually our emissaries realized that the leadership of [From.GetNameDef] had no interest whatsoever in even discussing the possibility of an alliance between our nations and returned back home.\n\nWe remain alone."
flowena.62.a:0 "We have been rejected..."

flowena.63.t:0 "Flowenan Embargo"
flowena.63.d:0 "The tiny but prosperous city-state of Flowena has long been a trade partner of ours, acting as an entrepot between Aquileia and Herzland. But in recent times they have been seeking closer ties with our rivals while drafting laws that restrict commerce between us. Today it reached the climax as a formal declaration was presented to us by their diplomat, saying that Flowena had officially embargoed us and frozen our bank accounts. It seems we won't be able to borrow money from them anymore either."
flowena.63.a:0 "Curse those traitors!"

flowena.64.t:0 "Investment Return"
flowena.64.d:0 "The investments made by our patricians have turned out to be profitable for the most part. Mortgages, shares, rents and more are making our banking families richer. They've thanked Bruno for his wise advice and asked for more investment tips, for he clearly knows how to make a profit."
flowena.64.a:0 "Our prosperity continues to grow."

flowena.65.t:0 "Negotiations In Flowena"
flowena.65.d:0 "The patricians of Flowena, concerned by growing tensions, have invited our dignitaries to their city. They wish for peace to prevail between Aquileia and the Griffonian Empire, reasoning that very little could be gained from such a large conflict. If Aquileia were to win, they would need to subjugate the independent-minded peoples of Herzland, and vice versa. The unrest following victory and the devastation that usually results from modern warfare would make all the war effort worthless. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers and civilians would certainly die for naught. Neutral countries too would suffer greatly, caught in the brutal crossfire between us.\n\nIt all seemed reasonable, but the emissaries of the opposing side clearly thought otherwise. They continued to push their claims and demands and we did the same in return. Mayor Bruno of Flowena did his best to calm us all down and said Boreas was ashamed of our bickering. Surely we would benefit and profit more from mutual cooperation and peace?"
flowena.65.a:0 "Perhaps we should give peace a chance."
flowena.65.b:0 "We cannot have peace with those bastards!"

flowena.66.t:0 "Negotiations Succeed"
flowena.66.d:0 "After many hours of tense discussions and arguments which almost devolved into clawfights, the dignitaries from Aquileia and the Griffonian Empire have finally managed to find some common ground thanks to our mayor Bruno. They have realized how bloody the war between them would be and that more could be gained from mutual peace. At the end of the day, a grand agreement was signed, the Griffenheim-Aquila pact, where both sides promised to respect each others' borders and sovereignty. Several trade deals were signed with Bruno's encouragement as well, and in gratitude both sides promised to leave us alone and respect our neutrality.\n\nIt remains to be seen if this peace will last, but we are hopeful."
flowena.66.a:0 "This is a miracle!"

flowena.67.t:0 "Negotiations Fail"
flowena.67.d:0 "The diplomats of [From.GetNameDef] have stormed out of the People's Palace, frustrated after many hours of pointless arguing and clawfighting which ultimately lead nowhere. Despite his best attempts, our mayor Bruno failed to calm the two sides who kept pushing their claims and demands. In fact, the emissaries even saw his interventions as insulting and say we would pay dearly for disrespecting representatives of such mighty nations."
flowena.67.a:0 "Arcturius save us..."

flowena.68.t:0 "Negotiations Fail"
flowena.68.d:0 "Our emissaries have returned from Flowena with bloodied clawmarks on their faces. It seems negotiations completely broke down and devolved into fighting. The dignitaries claim that the opposing side kept aggressively making demands and refusing to talk with them, no matter how much they tried to reason with them. Not only that but the leader of the city-state, Mayor Bruno de Rosebrune, tried to intervene in the negotiations and insulted both sides by trying to give them advice. Clearly the arrogant merchant needs to be taught a lesson in humility. We will not tolerate this!"
flowena.68.a:0 "This means war!"

flowena.69.t:0 "Negotiations Succeed"
flowena.69.d:0 "After many hours of tense discussions and arguments which almost devolved into clawfights, our dignitaries have finally managed to find some common ground thanks to the Flowenan mayor Bruno de Rosebrune.

flowena.70.t:0 "A Request From Flowena"
flowena.70.d:0 "A diplomat has arrived from the small city-state of Flowena, whose relations with us have become increasingly warm in recent times. He formally requested that the regent [Root.GetLeader], would grant them the status of an Imperial Free City in the name of Emperor Grover VI. Before the Revolution, Flowena did indeed have that status, and they remained loyal to us until chaos consumed Griffonia. Now they wish to return back to the good old days and ask for our protection."
flowena.70.a:0 "So be it."
flowena.70.b:0 "Request denied."

flowena.71.t:0 "Back To The Good Old Days"
flowena.71.d:0 "Our diplomat returned from Griffenheim and brought us wonderful news: The Empire has accepted our request and regent [From.GetLeader] has granted us the status of an Imperial Free City in the name of Emperor Grover VI. We are truly grateful and can now enjoy a new age of peace and prosperity!"
flowena.71.a:0 "The Emperor Protects."

flowena.72.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] Refuses"
flowena.72.d:0 "Our diplomat returned from [From.Capital.GetName] and brought us bad news: [From.GetNameDef] has refused our request, letting us remain independent. It is possible they are more than happy enough with the current state of affairs, or they simply don't think we're worth the effort. Whatever the case, we will have to survive on our own."
flowena.72.a:0 "Unfortunate."

flowena.73.t:0 "A Request From Flowena"
flowena.73.d:0 "A diplomat has arrived from the small city-state of Flowena, whose relations with us have become increasingly warm in recent times. He formally requested that the regent [Root.GetLeader], would grant them the status of an autonomous urban region within Aquileia itself. Before the invasion of Emperor Grover I, Flowena was our northeastern bastion, responsible for guarding our border. It remained part of the Kingdom until Grover III granted it the status of an Imperial Free City in 871. Now they wish to return back to the good old days and ask for our protection."
flowena.73.a:0 "We welcome them with open claws."

flowena.75.t:0 "Migrant Influx From Pomovarra"
flowena.75.d:0 "Bruno's cousin Camille has recently encouraged local peasants in Pomovarra to abandon their homes and move to Flowena, which has many opportunities for work. Now thousands of Pomovarrans have been entering our city and seeking employment. Our patricians have managed to provide them all with low-paying jobs that have no skill requirements and have thanked us for increasing the size of their workforce."
flowena.75.a:0 "Welcome, workers!"

flowena.76.t:0 "Pomovarran Food Exports"
flowena.76.d:0 "Camille's recent agricultural policies and investments have greatly increased production in Pomovarra, so much so that they have surplus to export. With her encouragement the peasants are now selling excess food to us at a relatively cheap price."
flowena.76.a:0 "We will never be hungry again."

flowena.77.t:0 "Patricians Protest"
flowena.77.d:0 "While initially many patricians approved of Chocolat's policies, such as lower taxes for the rich, his horrible handling of the general strike and especially the plague made them change their minds. Now the Seigneurie blocks anything Chocolat proposes, his relatives have turned against him with the exception of his dear brother and other families whisper in the shadows and conspire to overthrow him. Despite Bruno's best attempts to win their favour, many refused to trust him and some even believed he shared his brother's incompetence.\n\nTheir saviour came from an unlikely place. Anna de Indigo, whose family was a traditional rival of de Rosebrune, intervened and discussed with the Seigneurie and the patricians. She explained to them that violently forcing Chocolat from his position would set a dangerous precedent that would justify such actions in the future, meaning any future mayors could also be overthrown, causing chaos and instability in the city. She also reminded that Bruno could speak for his brother and be negotiated with.\n\nThus patricians abandoned their plans and hid away their daggers and pistols. At the same time, however, they realized what a skilled negotiator Anna was and grew increasingly fond of her. Unbeknownst to Bruno and Chocolat, behind the scenes she shook claws with many lesser families who had grown tired of the rule of de Rosebrune and promised it would soon come to an end."
flowena.77.a:0 "Worrisome."

flowena.78.t:0 "Anna de Indigo Holds a Speech"
flowena.78.d:0 "Lead by Michael Landreau, a huge crowd of workers once again gathered in front of the People's Palace, furious about the lack of reforms. The Seigneurie continued to refuse any proposals made by Chocolat or his brother, and thus none of the changes he had promised could be implemented. The griffons waved red flags and chanted their demands: Eight-hour workdays, fair wages, guild membership for all.\n\nChocolat panicked like last time, but his brother promised to take care of it. However, upon leaving the building he saw Anna de Indigo already holding a speech to the dissatisfied commoners. She urged them to calm down and promised Chocolat's reign was soon at an end, after which patricians would be willing to enter negotiations with them. She said that Chocolat had risen to power because of the corrupt and rigged sortitions which, everyone agreed, needed to be replaced with proper elections. Not only that, but she told about agreements she had made with other patricians about giving concessions to the workers and lowering taxes. All they needed to do was wait. Everything would be sorted out eventually, she promised.\n\nThe griffons cheered and praised her, although Michael Landreau remained sceptical. Bruno on the other claw had a terrible realization and rushed back inside to tell Chocolat that they were in trouble."
flowena.78.a:0 "At least the workers are calm now..."

flowena.79.t:0 "Anna Delivers Ultimatum"
flowena.79.d:0 "Chocolat and Bruno had dreaded this day for a week now. It finally came as Anna, accompanied by many patricians from other families as well as her own, entered the Mayoral office, a scroll in her claw. Chocolat hid behind his chair while Bruno defiantly stood in front of the office table.\nAnna raised an eyebrow and smiled. "It seems you were waiting for us."\n"Of course we were. You revealed your devious plans in public for all the city to hear! But I will not disappoint my father by letting our rivals usurp us so easily."\nAnna chuckled. "That would be foolish. Absolutely idiotic. Ahah... don't you see, de Rosebrune? The game is over. The commoners have turned against you, the patricians have abandoned you and even some of your relatives think it's time for change." Camille de Rosebrune, Bruno's cousin, looked down in shame. "I'm sorry, but this has to be done," she mumbled.\nBruno frowned. "You are right, but I am here to help my brother and make everything better. You can trust me, as I am not as... well, I doubt I will make the same mistakes he did."\nThis time Anna fully laughed. "You young fool. It's too late, don't you understand? Everyone has ran out of patience and refuse to give your brother a second chance. Sure, you might not be bad as him, but you are not the mayor. Which begs the question, what right would you have to rule us anyways? Are you trying to use your brother like a puppet for your own advantage?" She shook her head. "You should be ashamed."\nAt that moment Bruno realized his error, and that he should have accepted Chocolat's request and taken his place. But indeed, it was too late now.\nAnna opened her scroll and gave it to Bruno. It was a document of retirement, prepared for Chocolat and fully written. All it needed was a signature. "Admit it, you've lost. Tell your brother to sign the paper. Otherwise things won't end well for either of you. At all.""
flowena.79.a:0 ""Fine. You win, de Indigo.""
flowena.79.b:0 ""Begone, populist! We will not be blackmailed!""

flowena.80.t:0 "Anna Keeps Her Promise"
flowena.80.d:0 "Soon after word spread of Chocolat's resignation as mayor of Flowena, the city erupted into impromptu celebration that lasted day and night. Anna had proved that she could be trusted, and this trust was further solidified by what came after.\n\nA temporary government was formed, but to everyone's surprise Anna invited many commoners into the Seigneurie, an unprecedented act that angered some of the more conservative patricians. They were further aggravated by negotiations that soon begun with the workers and with Anna's desire to give in to many of their demands and repealing some of Chocolat's more conservative reforms such as trickle-down taxation. However, she said revolution was inevitable unless they compromised, and giving the commoners something is better than giving them everything or nothing. One patrician suggested simply hiring mercenaries to beat the dissidents into submission, which horrified Anna so much that she called him a barbarian.\n\nWhile many patricians remained unhappy, some soon realized that everyone would benefit from the tensions between the classes finally ending and began to wholeheartedly support Anna de Indigo and her family."
flowena.80.a:0 "Maybe we can set aside our differences?"

flowena.81.t:0 "Deciding Their Fate"
flowena.81.d:0 "Almost a century ago we were ousted by our fellow patricians and de Rosebrune, our most bitter rivals who had lead the conspiracy against us, seized power in the city and held it until now. Many in our family say time has come for payback, while others think by showing mercy we prove our moral superiority over them. We could banish the entire wicked and greedy family from Flowena, forbidding them from entering our home city ever again, or simply remove them from all positions in the Seigneurie and ensure they shall never step with their paws inside the People's Palace. The kindest proposal is to simply leave them be, and a few of our family members even say we could learn to cooperate with each other at last. Ultimately, it is up to Anna de Indigo to decide, for she is the mayor and the current head of the family."
flowena.81.a:0 "Exile them."
flowena.81.b:0 "Ban them from the Seigneurie."
flowena.81.c:0 "Leave them alone."

flowena.82.t:0 "Saved From Extinction"
flowena.82.d:0 "Nicolas had already resigned to a fate where he would never have a legitimate child with a patrician to continue his bloodline due to his family's reputation. So when a rose-tinted letter was delivered to him, he was almost in shock. For a long time he believed he was being tricked or fooled, until he met with Anna herself in person who assured him that the offer was genuine, and just to shut him up pecked his beak.\n\nSeveral weeks later a large crowd gathered in front of the Temple of Eyr where the marriage ceremony was held. Anna and Nicolas of course had no feelings whatsoever for each other and the mutual distrust did not go away, but both knew the marriage was a pragmatic one, a deal well worthwhile for both parties. Nicolas would get to continue his bloodline and in return promised to not conspire against the de Indigo family."
flowena.82.a:0 "A threat taken care of with a ring."

flowena.83.t:0 "The First Elections"
flowena.83.d:0 "Many patricians of Flowena found it strange how excited Anna and her fellow relatives were when the elections were held. They had worked so hard for so long to usurp their rivals and take power, yet now they willingly gave it all away to the common rabble? They did not understand, but did not complain either. Until they found out that not only would commoners be allowed to vote, they would be allowed to become election candidates as well. Yet their outraged protests were dismissed by Anna, who said this way they'd earn the love of the people, and some of the patricians would surely get elected anyways. They would simply have to get used to sharing power now, like in a proper democracy.\n\nOn election day the streets and skies filled with griffons, all chattering politics and who they were voting for. Some candidates stood on rooftops and balconies, holding speeches to curious crowds and explaining why they should be voted for. Voting booths were set up across the city, boxes quickly filling with votes and militiagriffs ensuring there was no foul play. When the sun set, the booths closed and the counting began.\n\nAnna couldn't sleep. That is how anxious she was about the elections. Not only would the members of the Seigneurie be chosen, but the mayor would be elected as well, and she hoped the griffons were wiser than the patricians thought and hadn't voted for some lying rich populist. When the results were finally revealed, she was overtaken with surprise and joy as she had been chosen by the people to lead them to a brighter future. The Seigneurie gained many commoner members and she looked forward to working with them."
flowena.83.a:0 "Long live democracy!"

flowena.84.t:0 "The Second Elections"
flowena.84.d:0 "Four years have passed since Flowena had its first truly democratic elections. Now it is time for the mayor and the other members of the Seigneurie to step down and allow others to take their place, unless they get re-elected for a second time.\n\nGriffons were once again happy to vote, though they did so with less enthusiasm as before, because the novelty had worn off. Patricians still grumbled, but did not protest as the commoner rule had not brought complete ruin to their nation like they had feared. At least, not yet.\n\nAnna herself had been happy to guide her people for so many years, but was now somewhat hesitant to give up her mayoral powers. What if her successor would be an incompetent fool rivaling Chocolat in idiocy? What if it was a fascist demagogue who would tear down everything she had spent so long building?\n\nHer fears turned out to be unfounded when the people re-elected her, having enjoyed her wise and gentle rule. She was overtaken with joy and thanked them all, though some in the crowd grumbled that it was a patrician dictatorship, no different from the old rule."
flowena.84.a:0 "She's earned it."

flowena.85.t:0 "The Third Elections"
flowena.85.d:0 "Yet another four years have passed and the time for elections has come yet again. Already the people of Flowena have gotten used to it so much that it is routine. The officials stepped down, Anna herself included, griffons went to the ballots and candidates started campaigning for support. Among them was Michael Landreau, a popular figurehead among the workers of the city who always campaigned for better conditions and new reforms. This time he had stepped up his campaigning and held speeches almost daily, gathering wide support among the labourers.\n\nAnna did not expect to be re-elected for a third time, and indeed she did not. Michael's hard work had paid off and for the first time in its history, Flowena had a commoner as the mayor. She was glad, though also somewhat saddened that she could no longer lead the people she loved. But she accepted the results and decided to retire from politics entirely, instead focusing on enjoying fine art and reading good books. Michael on the other claw thanked his supporters and promised many reforms for the working class."
flowena.85.a:0 "He has the workers' best interest at heart."

flowena.86.t:0 "The Fourth Elections"
flowena.86.d:0 "Once again the terms of the Seigneurie had ended and new elections would be held. Like clockwork, officials gave up their positions of power, voting booths were set up and griffons went to vote. Activity was the lowest it had been so far, but wasn't much lower than last year. Michael had been a popular leader but many doubted he'd manage to get re-elected, especially as he started showing disinterest in politics. In fact, no one knew who would become the next mayor, as there were many roughly equal candidates this year.\n\nTo everygriff's surprise, Camille de Rosebrune, a patrician who was the cousin of Chocolat and Bruno, gathered the most votes and would become the next mayor. Some griffons were unhappy with the news and refused to trust the cousin of the despised Chocolat, but in the end she had been legitimately elected and there was no sign of fraud. Commoners accepted her as their leader, which pleased Anna de Indigo as the social classes were still cordial with one another. Camille promised to be a kind ruler, but also said she would not ignore her fellow patricians and instead would take their interests far more seriously than Michael had done."
flowena.86.a:0 "If this is what they want, so be it."

flowena.87.t:0 "The Festival"
flowena.87.d:0 "Over the last several days, griffons have been busy decorating the streets of the city and renovating old buildings to their former glory. Any trash on the streets was cleaned up and numerous works of fine art were put on display in repurposed offices near the Cherryblossom Square, which were now known as the "Des Bureaux Gallery of Modern Art". When the day of the celebration finally came, the streets filled with griffons, both commoners and patricians, both curious commoners and visiting foreigners. Tickets were fairly cheap and were sold out within a day. Alongside the art presentation, which included many paintings and statues, several musical concerts were held and food stalls were set up, serving Aquileian, Herzlander and Pomovarran dishes. The old bridges of the city had been restored to their former glory and coloured lights illuminated them when the sun began to set. The party lasted long into the night and griffons enjoyed copious amounts of Aquileian wine and Herzland beer.\n\nAfter the celebrations finally ended at midnight, Anna de Indigo thanked everyone for attending and the visitors thanked her for organizing such a wonderful celebration. She had made a profit too, thanks to the high ticket sales. Half was donated to charity and the rest was stored in her family's vaults."
flowena.87.a:0 "Everyone had a good time."

flowena.88.t:0 "Flowena Makes A Deal"
flowena.88.d:0 "The patricians of Flowena have approached our military companies and signed a contract where they establish production facilities in their city in return for a considerable sum of money. They had already proven to be a reliable trade partner, so the deal was quickly signed. Their payment is being shipped to us via the newly built Skyfall-Flowena railroad, so the companies are already preparing to set up shop."
flowena.88.a:0 "Together we shall prosper."

flowena.89.t:0 "End of Enmity"
flowena.89.d:0 "Over the last months, Flowena had changed. More precisely, the griffons of different social classes treated each other completely differently. Before, patricians refused to even make eye contact with commoners passing by, and workers themselves whispered ill things of them behind their backs. It had not been rare to see a patrician be ambushed by his employees who were furious over being mistreated and abused for too long. It had also been common to see the patricians promising extra pay to those militagriffs who helped them put down any unrest among the "unruly filth". In addition, the culture of the two classes was so different they might as well had been from two distinct nations. Patricians wore fancy clothing, acquired expensive artwork and spent most of their day in meetings and luncheons. Commoners on the other claw had simple, practical clothes, entertained each other with stories and jokes and laboured almost ceaselessly in the factories.\n\nThanks to reforms of de Indigo, this was beginning to change completely. Realist artwork promoted by them displayed the plight of the poor for the wealthy to see, strict laws prevented patricians from abusing their workers and militiagriffs were now soldiers loyal to the government alone. Poverty rates had fallen too, meaning the commoners could afford better clothing and occasionally even bought paintings. Now that they were no longer ill-treated, they even began to respect their superiors. Meanwhile the patricians grew fascinated with the simple common life and sought to emulate it by embracing asceticism and romanticising the culture of the commoners.\n\nRates of crime and violence in the city had dropped to almost nothing. Patricians and commoners happily greeted each other on the street and formed relationships. When Anna witnessed all this, she smiled warmly and almost cried from joy. Her dream was becoming a reality before her eyes."
flowena.89.a:0 "Flowena is reborn anew."

flowena.92.t:0 "Flowena Sends Financial Aid"
flowena.92.d:0 "The banking families of Flowena have decided to support us economically by offering a generous loan with extremely low interest. So low, in fact, that it is a gift if anything. We should be thankful as we can now wisely invest their money into our economy. Truly, they have proven to be a good ally who share our values."
flowena.92.a:0 "Thank you."

flowena.93.t:0 "Flowena Ferments Unrest"
flowena.93.d:0 "Our security service has recently reported that a foreign country is covertly supporting democratic revolutionaries within our nation as well as spreading false propaganda about how "wonderful" life is in a liberal capitalist paradise. So far the primary suspect is the small city-state of Flowena, but there is little we can do against them as we lack solid proof. At least we can publicly denounce them and take action against the libertarian scum within our nation."
flowena.93.a:0 "Curse those fools."
flowena.93.b:0 "Let's teach them a lesson!"

flowena.94.t:0 "Flowena Invites Into Alliance"
flowena.94.d:0 "The free and democratic city-state of Flowena has sent an emissary to us who presented a gracious invitation. They wished for us to join their alliance, so we can form a closer bond and become stronger together, strong enough to fight back against foreign invaders who wish to take away our precious freedom. We appreciate this offer, but at the same time we must question if we truly need them as an ally. What can a mere city-state do to help us?"
flowena.94.a:0 "Let us be friends."
flowena.94.b:0 "We are strong enough alone."

flowena.95.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] Accepted Our Invitation"
flowena.95.d:0 "The emissary we sent to [From.GetNameDef] has returned from her journey, a joyful expression on her face. They have accepted our invitation into [Root.GetFactionName] and are eager to seek closer relations with us. Together, we can face any foreign oppressor and defeat them with ease!"
flowena.95.a:0 "We are stronger together!"

flowena.96.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] Refused Our Invitation"
flowena.96.d:0 "The emissary we sent to [From.GetNameDef] has returned from his journey, a mournful expression on her face. They have refused our invitation into [Root.GetFactionName] and have no interest in seeking closer relations with us. [Root.GetLeader] is concerned that they are too weak without an ally to aid them and hopes to find another way to help if they are threatened by invasion."
flowena.96.a:0 "Shame."

flowena.98.t:0 "Second Thoughts"
flowena.98.d:0 "Days passed, and Chocolat looked at the calendar anxiously. Outside his office, the people were waiting for his speech, to see what his grand plans for the future were. But doubt had beset him. Perhaps his plans were too ambitious, too confident, and his skills and knowledge too lacking to execute them? He was not certain and paced around his office, eating countless plates of comfort food to alleviate stress. After two weeks, he finally had an idea on what to do.\n\nHis younger brother Bruno, who was studying economics in Middenheim's university, was admittedly far more competent than him. And now Chocolat came to realize that he needed his help if he truly wanted to implement any changes. Yes, a letter would be sent to Yale, asking for Bruno to return and aid his sibling in need. Their father, Bronzino, had always wanted Chocolat to rule alone, but now it was clear to him that they were meant to rule together."
flowena.98.a:0 "With Bruno's help, Chocolat may rival Bronzino himself!"

flowena.99.t:0 "Militia Uprising"

But now merchants and peddlers refused to accept their cheques and saw them as worthless, meaning they could not buy bread or fish. The promises given remained unfulfilled. It did not take much longer before the militia were gathering in front of patricians' manors, demanding their money.\n\nMichael Landreau, a charismatic former militiagriff, was sympathetic to their plight and soon offered to aid them. He united the militia under one red banner and held speeches condemning the greedy bourgeoisie who had finally crossed the line. Fervour spread like wildfire and violence erupted. Manors were broken into and looted bare, patricians were stripped of their clothing and soon enough the People's Palace itself was stormed, the government deposed in an orgy of violence. At the end of the day, the red banner of the workers had been raised atop the city hall."

Before him stood the thousands of workers and militiagriffs of the city, filling the Cherryblossom Square to the brim, not a single patrician scum among them. Many griffons seemed uncertain. Before they had striven towards a single clear goal, but now that the goal had been achieved, what would happen?\n\nMichael began to speak, his voice confident in their future. He said that their work had not yet been done, that to truly free themselves they needed to change Flowena from the ground up. The weed of capitalism had to be thoroughly uprooted to prevent oppression from ever returning to their fair city. The wealth had to be redistributed, property had to be collectivized, the guilds had to be completely reformed. Indeed, there was much, much work to do, and they could not simply sit and do nothing. No, they were stout workers, proud of their professions, and they were not afraid of labouring ceaselessly, especially now that the fruits of their labour would not be stolen by the bourgeois bastards.\n\nLandreau filled the crowd with newfound determination, and they cheered, chanting "long live the revolution!" and shooting their rifles into the air."

flowena.101.d:0 "Today Michael Landreau and his fellow workers gathered at the People's Palace to extensively revise the legislation of Flowena and pass radical reforms. Many laws had existed for centuries, since the rise of the merchant class and increasing migration from abroad which motivated the original citizens to guard their rights. Now, they were all erased and cast into the dustbin of history. The undemocratic institution of the Seigneurie was dismantled and patricians were no longer exempt from taxation, could no longer own private property and did no longer have unique legal status that protected them from just punishments. In addition, the workers' council declared all griffons to be equal and free, no matter where they were born or who their parents were.\n\nThe patricians refused to see these changes as legitimate and protested, but they were greatly outnumbered by jubilant workers who approved the act and wholeheartedly supported the reforms. Most of the bourgeoisie were so outraged that they refused to stay in the city and fled to Aquileia, trying to take as many belongings with them as possible. Those few who stayed humbly accepted their new positions as regular, common citizens."

A new democratic congress of guild representatives has been formally established and held its first official meeting today in the People's Palace. The representatives had been chosen earlier in the first elections held in Flowena's history and every guildmember -- every working citizen -- was allowed to vote. Michael Landreau had been elected to be the Standard-Bearer of Justice and was the figurehead of the congress.\n\nIn the first meeting, the congress signed the draft of a new constitution that the workers' council had prepared earlier, and amended it with new laws. Corporeal punishment was banned, the temples lost their right to collect tithe and any remnants of Chocolat's catastrophic reforms were finally abolished. The congress agreed to reduce unemployment in the city by increasing cloth production and made further plans for the future.\n\nNow, at last, the workers of Flowena had a clear vision of the future, and knew what path they were heading towards. In their eyes, it was a path to utopia."

Standard-Bearer of Justice Michael Landreau held a speech in front of the gates of the city's largest botanical garden, saying how this was also a symbolic act. The gardens had been a privilege for few and patricians often enjoyed long walks and parties held among the trees and flowers, while the workers were forced to either watch jealously from behind the fences or focus on their work inside the garden, trimming branches and watering plants while their superiors relaxed. Now those privileges were gone and anyone could enter the gardens freely at any time, enjoy the fragrant flowers, admire the exotic plants and breathe in the clean, fresh air.\n\nThe gardens then filled with griffons, who held picnics, played games or simply had relaxing walks with their pet dogs. It was clear the gardens were already making the populace happier."

Many reminisced of doing the same many moons ago, back when the revolution had still been young and they had been filled with doubt. The city had changed much since then, and now they were back where it had all began.\n\nThe crowd went silent as Michael began speaking into a microphone. There was glee in his expression, and indeed he said how wonderful things were now and how they had a created a true haven for the workers. Here, no one was oppressed or exploited and everyone was treated as an equal, regardless where they came from. It had required much work, but now at least their goals had been accomplished.\n\nHe said that now they could enjoy their well-deserved rest and celebrate their achievement, for it was worthy of great pride. They had truly proven that Flowena has no need for oligarchs to rule over them, and that the workers can rule themselves just fine. Jubilantly he announced that today was a holiday and no one would have to work, and as he said so fireworks were set off behind him. The crowd cheered with joy, and Michael smiled."

The foreign advisors examined these prototypes. One was light-weight with a powerful engine but had a small gun; another was huge and cumbersome, but filled to the brim with heavy weaponry. The third prototype tried to balance mobility, armour and firepower without being a master of any. After much deliberation and discussion, the advisors finally concluded which design was best and would be feasible for mass-production."

However, it ought to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take in claw, more dangerous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things. Therefore Nicolas considers carefully how he will make his move.\n\nIn the end, he concludes that he has two options: Either take power dishonourably with wickedness and subterfuge, which would have a low chance of failure, or to boldly depose Chocolat with the favour of his fellow citizens, which would be difficult, arduous and extremely risky."

With some wood splinters in his skin, he entered inside and gasped.\n\nChocolat lied on the floor, not breathing or moving. A half-empty bottle of Skyfall whiskey, his favourite drink, was in his claw.\n\nBruno, overcome with terror, quickly tried to revive his brother with any means possible. But his body and heart remain still and ice-cold. All strength left Bruno and he broke down to tears as servants rushed inside, soon joining him in his mourning.\n\nAs he sobbed, he noticed numerous empty bottles around his brother. Clearly, he had drank himself to death. If only he had asked for his help earlier, then none of this would've happened, and thousands of griffons including him would still be alive and happy..."

flowena.110.t:0 "The Sortition"
flowena.110.d:0 "As news spread of Chocolat's death, griffons rejoiced and celebrated on the streets and in the sky. An impromptu firework display was even held at Cherryblossom Square. Meanwhile in the People's Palace the patricians prepared for an early sortition, a random lottery traditionally used to choose who would gain a position on the ruling council, the Seigneurie. The sortitions were originally intended to prevent factionalism, populism and conflict and had worked wonderfully, but over the years the results had become predictable as patricians agreed in advance who would gain which position and rigged the sortitions. Bronzino the Magnificent's name ended up being pulled every year for several decades and Chocolat was the "lucky" griffon three years in a row.\n\nNevertheless sortition was tradition at this point and the patricians proceeded with it like always, ignoring the usual grumbles of Anna de Indigo and her family who had always been proponents of democracy. Twelve names were written on pieces of paper, then placed in a bag. A commoner was invited to draw a name and read it out loud in front of the awaiting crowd outside the People's Palace. The commoners knew it was all rigged, but did not care as because any ruler was better than Chocolat had been.\n\nBruno himself had decided to honour his brother's memory and made many expensive deals with fellow patricians, ensuring he'd be chosen as the new mayor. He would repair everything his brother had ruined, build a grand memorial for him and convince the people that Chocolat only had good intentions and deserved none of the hate he received."

With ease he was now the leader of the city, and would soon begin many reforms centralizing power in his claws. Eventually, he could end the rule of the patricians, dismantle the Seigneurie and reclaim the crown, declaring himself Prince. But for now, he would celebrate and relax.\n\nThe door was slammed open. A cloaked figure entered, saying nothing. Nicolas stood up from his chair and grasped his pistol which was in his holster. "Who are you and what are you doing in my office?" he barked.\n\n"My name is Bruno de Rosebrune. You killed my brother. Prepare to die."\n\nBefore Nicolas could do anything, there was a bright flash and a loud bang, and blood spurted from his forehead. He collapsed on the floor, as dead as his father. His line had ended.\n\nBruno spat on his corpse and began to mumble. "As soon as you won the sortitions which you rigged in your favour, a terrible realization came to me. I rushed back to my manor, where I still had the whiskey bottle Chocolat had held in his claws when he passed away, as a memory of him. There was still some liquid left in it. I gave it to a stray dog on the street and it soon died, even though there was nowhere near enough alcohol in the whiskey to even kill a small mouse. Chocolat didn't die of alcohol overdose. He had been poisoned. And it did not require much contemplation to figure out who was behind it. You bastard. Your family will be always remembered as spineless filth, as it should be."\n\nAs curious griffons approached the office to find out where the gunshot had come from, Bruno broke the window in the office and escaped, flying away into self-imposed exile before they could conclude that he had killed Nicolas."

Violent clashes soon broke out, even as Anna and Michael agreed to negotiate at the People's Palace. One or the other would have to rule the city, and neither was particularly eager to let the other succeed Nicolas as mayor. But they knew that every minute spent arguing meant one more dead griffon on the streets. A deal had to be struck quickly, before complete anarchy would destroy them all."

Rulership can be obtained either by the favour of the people or by the favour of the merchants. The people do not wish to be ruled or oppressed by the patricians, and the patricians wish to rule and oppress the people. A principality is created either by the people or by the patricians, depending on who has the opportunity. Therefore Nicolas will try to convince either party that they need a strong leader. The patricians will need one if they see they cannot overcome the people by themselves, and the people, finding they cannot resist the wealthy, need one so as to be defended by his authority.\n\nBut there is a common saying in Griffonia: "He who builds on the people, builds on the mud." The rabble cannot always be relied upon, and it would be foolish to persuade yourself that the people will free you when you are oppressed by your enemies. The people are fickle and weak, easily roused into rebellion, while the patricians are determined and strong, dedicated to preserving order in the city at all costs."

flowena.114.d:0 "The arms with which a prince acquires his state are either his own, or they are mercenaries. Nicolas has for many years been a commander of the city's militia, and has gained their respect and loyalty. But they are militia, commoners with guns who spend most of their time living civilian lives with their families, sometimes forgetting even most basic training. In the face of true danger, they are likely to flee or surrender, wishing to survive so they can continue to make a living by supporting their relatives. Mercenaries, on the contrary, are grizzled and war-hardened, and loyal to the bitter end as long as they are paid. They care not for their families and spend all their time either fighting or preparing to fight. With their support, the coup would be easy, and any resistance would be crushed."

For many days he had secretly discussed the necessity of a coup with his fellow patricians, seeking their support and ultimately gaining it. He had convinced them that Flowena needed a strong leader to restore order and undo all the damage done by the incompetent mayor. Their immense wealth would now be used to guarantee his success and rise to power.\n\nOr so he thought.\n\nAs soon as Nicolas left his manor, he was arrested by his militiagriffs. Among them was Anna de Indigo, one of the patricians he had avoided talking with due to her democratic ideals, with a smug smile on her beak.\n\n"What is the meaning of this?!" Nicolas asked, which made Anna chuckle.\n"A little bird told the militia about your plans to depose the mayor and seize power. Apparently, the patricians saw you as your equal and weren't too fond of your delusions of grandeur. You're not the only power-hungry griffon who's trying to be clever. But don't worry, I'll do my best to become mayor through more legitimate means and bring true democracy, ending these conspiracies once and for all."\n\nNicolas muttered a curse as he was carried off to prison. However, he was surprised to learn that Chocolat de Rosebrune was willing to pay his ransom, as long as he'd curb his ambitions. He had a need for a skilled commander, and clearly wasn't too fond of Anna de Indigo either."

He had negotiated with an infamous mercenary captain from Skyfall and struck a deal with her, which had unfortunately cost all of his family's remaining wealth. The captain's company of myriad creatures from all across the world consisted of pony veterans from the Riverlands, fellow griffons from Nova Griffonia as well as zebra warriors, cruel harpy pirates and heavily armed centaurs from Zebrica. The mercenaries would support Nicolas, crush any resistance and ensure he would gain power in the city.\n\nOr so he thought.\n\nAs Nicolas left his manor and met with the captain in a shadowy alley, he was surprised to find out she asked for more money. When he said this was outrageous, the captain simply said she had altered the deal. Nicolas demanded his money back if they refused to follow his orders, and received a clawed fist in the face. The captain left, saying the deal was terminated, and thanked him for the gold.\n\nNicolas considered using his militia to arrest the traitors, but that would mean revealing to all that he had hired them in the first place, which would arouse suspicion. So he had no choice but to let them go and return to work as a humble militia commander. He now needed the salary to survive."

flowena.117.t:0 "The Coup"
flowena.117.d:0 "Today was the day that Nicolas had spent much time preparing and planning for. Today, the plans would be set in motion and Chocolat would be deposed at last. He had held private speeches to commoners and spread pamphlets across the city, saying how only he, Nicolas de Charbon, had the power to bring order and prosperity to their suffering city. He would end the decadent and corrupt rule of the patricians and end their oppression of the people. He reminded them of his skills as the commander of the militia and vowed to have the people's best interests in mind despite being a patrician. With this, thousands soon supported him, some even doing so openly, seeing him as their black saviour.\n\nNicolas had also spoken to his loyal citizen-soldiers, who would be his most fanatic supporters. He knew them personally and they knew him; To them, he was like a wise and strong father figure. On the day before the coup, they had all sworn oaths of loyalty, and trusted that with their help Nicolas would end the disarray in the city.\n\nWhen the time finally came, the plan was executed flawlessly. Nicolas lead the militiagriffs from the barracks on a march to the People's Palace, and as they went commoners soon followed them and joined their ranks. By the time they reached the Cherryblossom Square, Nicolas was leading a vast host of thousands. But in front of the palace stood a force equal in size: Grim mercenaries armed to the beak. Apparently someone had revealed his plot to the patricians who had hired them to stop his coup. For a moment his followers wavered, but Nicolas drew his pistol and charged at the sellswords. The militia followed after a moment of hesitance, and soon the people did so too.\n\nTo their surprise, the mercenaries did not fire a single shot. Instead, they immediately broke and fled, having no intention to actually risk their lives for a paltry amount of gold. Nicolas grinned and entered the Palace, where the members of the Seigneurie were hiding in terror. As the militiagriffs pointed their rifles at Chocolat, he signed a document presented to him by Nicolas which granted him all powers of state in perpetuity."

flowena.118.t:0 "The Purge"
flowena.118.d:0 "By not continually upsetting the people, the prince will be able to make them feel more secure, and win them over by benefits. He who does otherwise, either from reluctance or evil advice, is always forced to keep the knife in his claws. He cannot rely on his subjects, and they cannot attach themselves to him, because of the continued and repeated wrongs. One has to also remark that griffons ought either to be well treated or crushed because they can revenge themselves of lighter injuries, but of more serious ones they cannot. Therefore the injury that is to be done to someone ought to be of such a kind that one does not stand in fear of revenge.\n\nWith this wisdom in mind, Nicolas acted with swiftness: Soon Michael Landreau was found dead, killed by an unknown assailant. Nicolas immediately accused the wicked de Indigo and de Rosebrune families of this act, saying that Michael had been his ardent supporter and had thus received their wrath. This news shocked and angered the workers, who joined his militiagriffs and went out into the streets and the opulent manors, seeking out all patricians of those families no matter where they hid. The dangerous individuals were branded enemies of state, then destroyed utterly, with lynchings, murders and worse. Few, if any, escaped the righteous wrath of Nicolas and his people.\n\nAny potential opposition and threat to Nicolas' absolute rule had been eliminated while it was still divided and confused by the sudden turn of events. The most dangerous patrician families were gone and the workers now saw him as their leader and the successor to Michael Landreau. Thus the state had been secured, and Nicolas could rest peacefully at night. Yet those who took no part in the violence were now afraid, and those who never supported Nicolas or his coup viewed him with disdain and distrust. They, too, would be taken care of."

His armed militiagriffs kept a close eye on the audience, looking for those who did not share everyone else's enthusiasm and who appeared to act suspiciously.\n\nThis experiment of moving from a constitutional to an absolute government is dangerous, because it can only be tried once. The actions of a new prince are more critically observed than those of an hereditary one. When princes are seen to be capable they gain more followers and make them more loyal than ancient blood. This is because griffons are attracted more by the present than by the past. When they find the present good, they enjoy it and seek no further. They will also strongly defend a prince if he does not fail them in other things. Thus it will be a double glory for him to have established a new principality, and enriched and strengthened it with good laws, good arms, good friends and good leadership. If the prince has established himself as a person who can command, and is a griffon of courage who does not fail in other qualifications, and who, by his resolution and energy, keeps all the people encouraged – such a one will never find himself abandoned by the people, and it will be shown that he has laid his foundations well."

But Nicolas' reign had no need for such luxuries. The gardens were set alight, the exotic trees cut down en masse and flowers torn from the ground and thrown away. The factories were repurposed and turned into gunsmiths' workshops and armouries. If they wished to survive in this tumultuous age, they needed to become strong, and strength was founded upon armaments, not colourful fabrics.\n\nMany workers cheered and celebrated the act, happy to see the greedy patricians wail upon losing the source of their wealth. But a few mourned, seeing the gardens as something that had made Flowena special and beautiful, instead of merely being used for profit.

flowena_news.1.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Diplomats from the Griffonian Empire and Aquileia concluded what observers are describing as a historic agreement today with the signing of the Griffenheim-Aquila Pact. This non-aggression pact stipulates that both sides respect mutual borders and maintain open trade between each other. Flowena was a signatory to this treaty as well and both have agreed to respect the neutrality of the tiny city-state. Some sceptics say this peace treaty will not last for long, but many remain hopeful."

flowena_news.2.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]The centuries-old tradition of client confidentiality came to an end earlier today in [FLO.GetNameDef]. Its leading council, the Seigneurie, unanimously agreed in a vote to repeal numerous laws enacted over the years that made disclosing customer information a punishable offence. Already thousands of documents have been published, and now hundreds of wealthy individuals across Griffonia have been exposed for using Flowenan bank accounts to evade taxes and launder money. Millions have already been confiscated. While the banks have lost many customers, their honest and law-abiding clients are happier than ever."

FLO_ask_loan:0 "Borrow From Flowena"
FLO_ask_loan_desc:0 "The banks of the small city-state of Flowena are filled to the brim with gold and coin. If we wish, we can ask them for a loan. We'd have to pay yearly interest but could invest the money into our economy."

FLO_sacking:0 "Sacking Flowena"
FLO_sack_vaults:0 "Pillage Bank Vaults"

FLO_request_guarantee:0 "Request A Guarantee From [From.GetNameDef]"
FLO_request_guarantee_desc:0 "We are a small and weak country, and our freedom is fragile. Thankfully, our revolutionary friends in Aquileia have beaten the monarchists. We should seek to establish close diplomatic ties and request a guarantee of our independence before it is too late."

FLO_republic:0 "The Republic"
FLO_declare_republic:0 "Form The Republic"

FLO_core_camris:0 "Integrate Camris"
FLO_core_camris_desc:0 "Camris is an underdeveloped rural region in between the rivers Erne and Pom, with several forests whose wood is used as fuel in both Camris and Flowena. Our city was once considered part of this region before it became a Free City in 871. Those who still speak Pomovarran retain the local Camrisian dialect and speak it with pride. It is only natural that we now rejoin our realms together into one, welcome their representatives into our government and allow locals to join the Republic's citizen militia."
FLO_core_pomovarra:0 "Integrate Pomovarra"
FLO_core_pomovarra_desc:0 "The hilly realm of Pomovarra is considered by nationalists to be our native land. Indeed, the original citizens of Flowena can all speak Pomovarran somewhat fluently, and our city was once part of the County of Pomovarra during the rule of the Discrets. Now things have gone full circle and control the towns which used to rule over us. Perhaps we need not seek to subjugate one another, but instead try to live together as equals."
FLO_core_avian:0 "Integrate Avian"
FLO_core_avian_desc:0 "The flat and fertile plains of Avian have for years now produced food for us to consume. Now they can sell to our markets with no need to pay tolls, but perhaps we should seek even closer relations with the locals. Long have they suffered under the despotic rule of House Avian and their aristocratic lackeys. We will not only introduce republicanism but also recognize the status of the two languages spoken in Avian, Griffish and Aquileian. They will see us as liberators and remain unquestionably loyal."
FLO_core_lissay:0 "Integrate Lissay"
FLO_core_lissay_desc:0 "While the vast forests of Lissay remain infested by local outlaws, we have pacified the rest of the countryside. The locals rebelled some decades ago and broke off from Greifwald due to heavy taxation, and now they fear we will oppress them similarly. To earn the trust of the griffons, we will instead give them limited self-rule and allow them to form their own militias. This way they'll be more than willing to let us extract the valuable oil from their soil."

FLO_fasc_coring:0 "Colonization"
FLO_fasc_coring_desc:0 "When a state is acquired, the best course is to establish colonies in one or two places which will tie the state to you. If you do not do this, you will have to keep part of your army there. A prince does not have to spend much on such settlements, for with little or no expense he can send the settlers there and keep them there. He offends only a minority of the citizens from whom he takes land and houses to give to the new settlers. Those whom he offends, remaining poor and scattered, are never able to injure him; while the rest being uninjured are easily kept quiet, and at the same time are anxious not to cause trouble in case they lose their land and houses."
FLO_colonize_camris:0 "Colonize Camris"
FLO_colonize_camris_desc:0 "Camrisians share our native dialect and many customs, and were once loyal subjects of our Prince's ancestors. But lately their lands have been infested with nationalists, republicans and separatists, so colonization is ultimately necessary to secure order in the state."
FLO_colonize_pomovarra:0 "Colonize Pomovarra"
FLO_colonize_pomovarra_desc:0 "The Prince has returned to his homeland, after so many generations. Much has changed since then, and disorder has plagued the land for years. Rebels must be crushed and the loyalty of the locals ensured with colonization."
FLO_colonize_avian:0 "Colonize Avian"
FLO_colonize_avian_desc:0 "The uneducated peasants of Avian are used to living under a monarchy, yet have grown rather fond of the House of Avian. Any remnants of that family must be destroyed, and the Prince must present himself as the legitimate successor of the former Lords and Ladies. Urbanites from Flowena will then introduce civilization to them, and show how they can benefit from adopting to the new order."
FLO_colonize_lissay:0 "Colonize Lissay"
FLO_colonize_lissay_desc:0 "Ever since their rebellion, the griffons of Lissay have grown accustomed to self-rule. Due to the mismanagement of Count Cloudet, they distrust princes and wish to be left alone. Obedience must once more be taught to them, and anyone connected to the forest brothers will have their meagre property seized and given to armed colonists who will ensure law and order instead of anarchy."
FLO_colonize_balefire:0 "Colonize Balefire"
FLO_colonize_balefire_desc:0 "The griffons of Balefire share few of our customs, but have grown weary of war under the rule of House Erie. The Prince shall promise them not only peace but also prosperity, and his colonists will ensure loyalty of the locals."
FLO_colonize_eagleton:0 "Colonize Eagleton"
FLO_colonize_eagleton_desc:0 "Eagleton was where the uprising began, and as such we must be especially careful with this region. Any thoughts of resistance or banditry must be suppressed by our faithful colonists."
FLO_colonize_comrick:0 "Colonize Comrick"
FLO_colonize_comrick_desc:0 "Comrick has changed claws before in its history, having been sold to House Erie by House Avian. As such, they should adapt easily to once again having a new overlord, yet just in case colonists must be sent to ensure smooth integration."

FLO_found_alliance:0 "Found The Free Western Alliance"
FLO_found_alliance_desc:0 "During the restless time of the Aquileian revolution, we and many of our neighbours gained their much-desired freedom from oppressive overlords. Now that foreigners wish to once again subjugate us, we must band together to defend our hard-earned liberty and democracy."

FLO_commie_stuff:0 "Spreading The Revolution"

FLO_spread_word_of_revolution:0 "Incite Workers"
FLO_spread_word_of_revolution_desc:0 "Proletariat should not be content in misery, but keep demanding more and more concessions from the upper class, which they shall not receive. This will motivate them to take up arms and use more forceful means to get what they desire."
FLO_support_revolutionaries:0 "Support Revolutionaries"
FLO_support_revolutionaries_desc:0 "Weapons are tools with which the working class will emancipate itself. Our skilled gunsmiths are more than happy to make them, knowing they will be put to good use killing aristocrat filth."

FLO_invite_to_faction_desc:0 "The grim truth is that alone we are too weak to resist the imperialist powers of Griffonia. But together, we have a chance to not only survive, but to defeat the invaders and spread the revolution far and wide."

FLO_fasc_stuff:0 "Princely Ambitions"

FLO_sabotage:0 "Send Saboteurs"

FLO_commit_war_crime_desc:0 "Our scientists have gathered hundreds of fleas from the rats captured from the western borough. These fleas carry the pathogen that causes the wet plague, but by now most of our populace has developed an immunity to it. Our neighbours haven't. By smuggling rats infested with these parasites, we can greatly weaken our enemies, without them ever finding out what hit them. The morality of such an act is questionable, but if the goal is the destruction of our foes and the dominance of our prince, then it is worth it."

### Leader descs

FLO_failure_desc:0 "Chocolat de Rosebrune is the son of the famous and respected Bronzino the Magnificent who ruled Flowena as mayor for decades before his death in 1003. Chocolat has been the mayor ever since, but in that time he has done very little besides host opulent parties at his family manor. The governance of the city has largely been left to the patricians of the Seigneurie and the bureaucrats, both of whom have no desire to change anything as in their eyes everything is fine. Recently however Chocolat has shown desire in taking a more active role and abandoning some of his hedonistic ways."
FLO_literally_machiavelli_desc:0 "Nicolas de Charbon is the last living member of the small de Charbon dynasty. His father was an attorney, but was too indebted to afford joining the Judges' Guild. His family had once been Princes of Pomovarra before the title had been abolished by the King of Aquileia. Ever since the family had lived in exile in Flowena, wealthy enough to be considered patricians but never gaining full citizenship. As a child, Nicolas was taught rhetoric and history, and became fluent in multiple languages. As an adult he has worked as a secretary, a diplomat and finally as a commander of the militia. With his extensive knowledge of politics and history, he wishes for Aquileia to centralize, secure its independence and regain its long-lost strength. Being disappointed with both the republicans and the Discrets, he now believes only he alone can save his homeland from chaos and barbarians."
FLO_fancybird_desc:0 "Anna de Indigo is the middle-aged head of her family that has long championed the rights of the commoners and wished to treat them as equals instead of inferiors. They used to lead the city's patricians over a century ago but were deposed in a plot of de Rosebrune family, their bitter rivals. She is a charismatic yet cunning griffon who owns a sizeable art collection and donates to charity every week. Despite her age, she remains unwed as she waits for the perfect political marriage to take advantage of."
FLO_syndiescum_desc:0 "Michael Landreau is a wool comber and a former militiagriff in his forties. His mother was a washer and his wife sells fish. He doesn't have a single drop of patrician blood in his veins, and his family had migrated to Flowena from Rila several generations ago. Michael himself joined the militia at a young age as it was one of the better paying jobs and participated in several skirmishes with Pomovarra, but was fired after he refused to beat up striking workers. He then became a wool worker, and became increasingly radicalized as he experienced the poor working conditions in person. In recent years he used his charisma to organize strikes and spread word of revolution across the working class. His goal has finally been accomplished, and he is happy to be the popular figurehead of a workers' Flowena."
FLO_brudda_desc:0 "Bruno de Rosebrune is the youngest son of Bronzino the Magnificent. During his childhood he was often neglected by his father, who spent much of his time taking care of his older brother Chocolat. Left on his own, Bruno became reclusive and focused on his studies. When he grew older his mother ensured he could afford studying at the University of Economics in Middenheim before passing away. Now, after many years, he has returned to his home city and replaced his brother as the mayor of Flowena. His extensive knowledge of economics will be put to good use."

FLO_general_machiavelli_desc:0 "§gNicolas de Charbon is the last living member of the small de Charbon dynasty. His father was an attorney, but was too indebted to afford joining the Judges' Guild.

FLO_kock_desc:0 "§gA famed and capable mercenary from Herzland, Astrit Koch has served Flowena numerous times over the years, guarding the city from foreign aggression and maintaining order in the city itself. She is an experienced captain of several mercenary companies and participated in numerous conflicts across Griffonia before entering regular service under Flowena's wealthy patricians. Two years ago she was offered a position as a captain of the militia along with free citizenship, which she graciously accepted. Nearing her fifties, she looks forward to a peaceful and opulent retirement in a Flowenan manor.§!"
FLO_artois_desc:0 "§gBorn with his twin sister during the Aquileian revolution as François de Artois' firstborn son. In the awe of the republican windstorm his family lost nearly everything – that situation was about to repeat itself. Young Rene began to learn the art of war at very early age from his uncles who took part in both revolution and restoration of monarchy – continuing later in an officer academy.\n\nWealth and prestige of the House increased slowly and steadily under the strict eye of Lord de Artois. The culminating point of it was supposed to be a wedding of his oldest daughter Marie and noblegriff form Discret family – blessing that was about to become the greatest curse. At the day of her wedding, she ran away in fear that new husband would turn out to be just like her father and brother.\n\nWith their reputation now in ruins the only logical step was to move away from Aquileia – they chose Flowena. Seeing all his hard work turning to dust in such short moment, Lord François experienced a mental breakdown. Unable to lead, the mantle of the head of the house was left to his oldest son, René De Artois. At first, he did not take the sudden change too well, but soon he understood that he had no choice in the matter. Felling bitter over losing the grand future they had promised him he enlisted in the Flowenan militia – in his surprise he was most welcomed there.§!"
FLO_inferior_desc:0 "§gThe Vermilions are perhaps the least liked patrician family in Flowena. Their aggressive pursuit of wealth and competition allowed them to become among the richest families in Flowena, but made them few friends among the other families. The youngest child of Gâteau de Vermilion, the least liked head of house since Oeuf de Vermilion, who first established the family in Flowena, Aileclaire never quite got along too well with the rest of the family. She had little interest in the business enterprises the family was infamous for. Furthermore, she was often rebellious to the wishes of the family and didn't find much company in the other Vermilion children, only ever really listening to her older brother Christophe.\n\nWhat Aileclaire did find interesting was firearms and history. In her early years she could be found pouring over old texts on tactics and wars long past during the times when she should have been studying mathematics or accounting. She was also fond of sneaking out to the militia headquarters and practicing shooting with many of the soldiers there. Her father obviously did not approve of this, and once she was old enough, she started to spend less and less time in Flowena. Often disappearing from the city for months at a time, traveling griffonia and almost completely untraceable, though it was rumored that she tended to appear at various shooting competitions across griffonia. She rarely spent time in Flowena, only really returning after her father's death. Her skill with the gun was well known by this point and upon application with the militia it was found that her ability and ambitions extended far further than just down the sights of her rifle.§!"

### Focuses ###
WIN_the_legation_joint_command:0 "The Legation Joint Command"
WIN_the_legation_joint_command_desc:0 "The command of the Legation's "Military" has fallen to a joint command of Chiropterran, Wingbardian, and Colthaginian advisors and strategists. Their skills... vary, but the melting pot of ideas they bring to the table makes our military strong in its diversity, and always able to find new talent."
WIN_colthaginian_support:0 "Colthaginian Logistics"
WIN_colthaginian_support_desc:0 "The Colthaginian department of Legation Command has decided to take up the responsibility of keeping our forces supplied with all the non-military supplies needed by the garrison as well as non-combat military roles. We would be fools to say no to this offer."
WIN_wingbardian_arms:0 "Wingbardian Rifles"
WIN_wingbardian_arms_desc:0 "Wingbardian industry is shaping up to be the backbone of our military production, and a new shipment of weapons is coming in, along with new Wingbardian officers here to assert their military importance within the Legation."
WIN_chiropterran_expertise:0 "Chiropterran Expertise"
WIN_chiropterran_expertise_desc:0 "The Chiropterran General Staff has quickly proved itself to be one of the most skilled military entities on the continent of Zebrica, and their officers will make up the majority of our own command staff, bringing their expertise to our garrison forces."
WIN_nested_artillery:0 "Artillery Utilisation"
WIN_nested_artillery_desc:0 "Colthaginian and Wingbardian industrialists and military personnel have recently imported large amounts of heavy artillery and have begun equipping our garrison units with these weapons. This will hopefully give the legation forces a bit more bite to go with their bark.\n\nThough the bats aren't thrilled about how they weren't consulted..."
WIN_adapt_chemicals:0 "Lachrymator Agent Implementation"
WIN_adapt_chemicals_desc:0 "Now that Winggarden has settled into a state of "normalcy," the reality of the situation is setting in for many hippogriffs. And they have begun to fight back. Our Chiropterran advisor Ocean Spray has a simple solution to this. To be obeyed by all police and army units within the city.\n§R"Gas them all."§!"
WIN_militarized_police_force:0 "Militarise The Police"
WIN_militarized_police_force_desc:0 "To keep further order within the city, the Legation Council has decided it is time to enlist some locals in defense of Winggarden. A new separate constabulary shall be established dealing with matters of national defense different from the local police forces. These Hippogriffs will take oaths of loyalty to the mandate system, and shall serve to ensure Winggarden never returns to Hippogriffia. Hopefully."
WIN_special_command:0 "Special Weapons and Tactics Department"
WIN_special_command_desc:0 "To supplement our new police forces, Generals Pillar and Beep have put a suggestion before the council. A singular unit derived from the most loyal and experienced soldiers of the rest of our forces, equipped and supplied like the elite special forces of the rest of the world. Called S.W.A.T., it shall fall under Beep's command and be the new face of Winggarden's defense."
WIN_a_new_general_command:0 "The Winggarden General Defence Council"
WIN_a_new_general_command_desc:0 "Now that our military command, as well as our rule over the city, have been solidified, we can afford to formalize our military into one cohesive whole. No longer are we a collection of mercenaries and police units, now we are the General Defense Council, the sole body responsible for the city's protection, and the one thing stopping anarchy from taking over."
WIN_local_arms_production:0 "Armament Production Optimisation"
WIN_local_arms_production_desc:0 "We can not afford to continuously bring in foreign weapons. Seriously. The budget can't fit it. In order to solve this, the Legation has sanctioned a local gunsmith open to working with us to open new industrial arms manufacturing facilities to supply the garrison's forces. This should hopefully keep our units supplied and ready to combat any insurgency."
WIN_the_legation_volunteer_force:0 "Bolster the Legation Volunteer Force"
WIN_the_legation_volunteer_force_desc:0 "The Winggarden military forces are not a conventional volunteer or even a conscripted army. It is made up of foreign army personnel from our three benefactors, as well as any other foreign volunteers willing to join. As long as they don't have any connections to the Hippogriffs.\n\n§gWe can't trust those bird horses...§!"
WIN_urban_warfare_expertise:0 "Urban Warfare Training"
WIN_urban_warfare_expertise_desc:0 "If we are to resist the calls of "democracy" and "freedom" from our population, we are going to need to know how to fight against any armed rising that may occur. For this, we need our troops to be expertly trained in urban warfare. Training shall be conducted in mock urban environments across North Zebrica in order to ensure our effectiveness."

WIN_chiropterran_fighters:0 "The Legation Shadowbolts"
WIN_chiropterran_fighters_desc:0 "The Chiropterran Shadowbolts are the heirs to Nightmare Moon's aerial legacy, and they pride themselves on being some of the best pilots in the world. And so, they have been polite enough to grant us our own regiment of these pilots for our city's defense."
WIN_the_air_cavalry:0 "Air Cavalry Tactics"
WIN_the_air_cavalry_desc:0 "Quick response military units are always of need when one of your chief goals is resistance suppression. And for us, the providers are the elite Paratroopers of the 1st Winggarden Air Cavalry, who will form the core of our elite forces for the foreseeable future."
WIN_pigeoion_contracts:0 "The Pigeonio Contract"
WIN_pigeoion_contracts_desc:0 "A Wingbardian aircraft company has recently offered to set up a new industrial plant within our city, they offer both civilian craft for the rich and powerful as well as military bombers for use against our enemies."
WIN_expand_airport:0 "Expand the Winggarden Airport"
WIN_expand_airport_desc:0 "The Winggarden airport, once the premier civilian airfield of the Hippogriffian south, is now under Legation control. And it seems that it can serve as a fantastic military airfield for our good friends, the Shadowbolts. We shall also reopen part of it for civilian shipping uses, to keep up appearances at least."
WIN_air_fortifications:0 "Anti-Air Fortifications"
WIN_air_fortifications_desc:0 "Our air warfare capabilities will always be outshone by those of our benefactors, and even those of the Hippogriffs, so in order to defend our skies we must fight fire with ice. Anti-Air batteries are cheap and effective ways to destroy aircraft en masse, Winggarden must not fall!"

WIN_the_establishment:0 "Ab Urbe Condita"
WIN_the_establishment_desc:0 "Long live Winggarden!\n\nAnd may whatever gods our leaders believe in bless them in keeping this place together..."
WIN_foritifcations:0 "Urban Redoubts"
WIN_foritifcations_desc:0 "The safety of our oasis of prosperity is continuously threatened from without and within. Our benefactors, anxious to keep control, have provided funding to fortify certain buildings throughout the city in order to secure our hold on the city. We must never let the Hippogriffs take it back!"
WIN_a_forum_for_peace:0 "A Forum Of Peace"
WIN_a_forum_for_peace_desc:0 "The prime architect of the Legation, Gilippo Gappi, sees this place as a "Forum of Peace", where the powers involved can all gain something, and any creature who wants a chance to rise higher can do it here. The Chiropterrans and Colthaginians have... a different view. But since it was Gappi who formed this government, his vision will win out for now."
WIN_a_stratified_bureaucracy:0 "Stratify the Bureaucracy"
WIN_a_stratified_bureaucracy_desc:0 "The majority of the low-level bureaucrats that make Winggarden state run smoothly are from Colthage, and thus they have strong influence over the day to day running of the Legation. They have thus introduced a bill that officializes their control, establishing quotas for the national origin of certain officials, and ensuring they come out on top."
WIN_improve_trade_relations:0 "The Gappi Plan"
WIN_improve_trade_relations_desc:0 "Gappi has recently proposed another plan to the legation council, it will virtually abolish all trade tariffs within Winggarden, allowing goods and commerce to flow freely under the Legation's watchful eye. Considering the Legation's position, this will be of clear benefit to us, but it will also benefit the free trade interests of the Wingbardian representatives, increasing their influence over Legation policy."
WIN_balance_the_council:0 "Balance The Interests"
WIN_balance_the_council_desc:0 "Things have gotten a bit hectic down here in the legation, we're losing control, and our benefactors are starting to get suspicious of one another, thankfully we have one chance to make this right. Article 43b of the Winggarden Legation charter has a contingency where we can completely wipe clean our government and call on the benefactors to hash out a new one. But they won't stand for this more than once."
WIN_tighten_the_grip:0 "Tighten the Grip"
WIN_tighten_the_grip_desc:0 "Now that the Legation has formed itself into a "nation" and not just a motley crew of foreigners, we can begin to further exert our influence on this land. The Twelve Concessions are extremely vague when it comes to how much control we have, and we can use that to our advantage. Applying more pressure on Hippogrifia, we can gain more of an advantage over them, and further pressure them into decline."
WIN_an_intelligence_agency:0 "The Legation Security Service"
WIN_an_intelligence_agency_desc:0 "The Legation security service is a compound effort between all three of our benefactors. While run mainly by bats, this is a truly collaborative effort to crush all resistance to the Legation's governance through more secretive means. The Security Service's job is to ensure that our new status quo holds, and that this city thrives away from Hippogriff control."
WIN_hippogriff_volunteers:0 "The Hippogriff Volunteer Department"
WIN_hippogriff_volunteers_desc:0 "Now that our government has settled in, and the immediate threat of armed rebellion has passed, we have decided it is time to begin recruiting select locals into our police force and military. While foreigners will still make up the bulk of our forces, we can supplement them with hippogriffs just to make up the slack."

WIN_commission_a_fleet:0 "Commission the Fleet"
WIN_commission_a_fleet_desc:0 "We will never match Hippogriffia itself, even in its reduced state, but we can still build up a fleet to protect our shipping from other threats."
WIN_underwater_antipartisan_operations:0 "Submarine Anti-Partisan Operations"
WIN_underwater_antipartisan_operations_desc:0 "Roughly half of the Legation's de jure territory lies beneath the water's surface. It's inhabitants are seaponies, the "other half" of the Hippogriffian realm and it has presented a... unique issue for our administration. None of the three species holding guard over the Legation can breathe underwater, meaning we are having to resort to... unique methods to halt resistance to our rule in this territory."
WIN_the_joint_marine_force:0 "The Winggarden Marine Corps"
WIN_the_joint_marine_force_desc:0 "We will never be on the same level as the natives when it comes to amphibious warfare adaptations. But hopefully, by training up a foreign funded marine brigade, we can come as close as possible to evening the playing field."
WIN_build_up_shipyards:0 "Fund the Shipyards"
WIN_build_up_shipyards_desc:0 "In order to maintain our fleet out of our small urban city, we will need to establish drydocks in the bay to repair vessels and construct new ones."

WIN_the_tram_system:0 "Modernise the Tram System"
WIN_the_tram_system_desc:0 "Wingarden already has an extensive tram system, even if it has not aged with grace. The combined resources of our benefactors, however, means that we will be able to court the services of some of the world's finest engineers, and in time we can make this tram system the most modern in the world!"
WIN_the_development_bank:0 "The Winggarden Development Fund"
WIN_the_development_bank_desc:0 "Despite our benefactors' differences, all are interested in seeing Winggarden prosper. Consolidating the resources we've acquired since the 12 concessions, we will be able to build up a new bank to specifically help with the development of the city."
WIN_colthaginian_companies:0 "Invite Colthaginian Companies"
WIN_colthaginian_companies_desc:0 "Our Colthaginian benefactors are an economic powerhouse. It would not take much to ensure that their conglomerates can install themselves in Winggarden, increasing their influence and our industrial capacity both."
WIN_AGWP_investments:0 "AGWP Contracts"
WIN_AGWP_investments_desc:0 "The Wingbardian delegate has been in contact with one of the premier Wingbardian petrochemical companies, and they've signalled their interest in establishing themselves in the city. Not only would it mean Winggarden becomes the center of a world-class oil refinery, it would also be a fine feather in representative Gappi's hat."
WIN_develop_the_arsenal:0 "The Winggarden Arsenal"
WIN_develop_the_arsenal_desc:0 "Prosperity begets envy, and if Winggarden is to ensure that the prosperity built up within her city limits remains in her hooves, she must be ready to defend it. None has questioned this particular point, and for once the three representatives put equal enthusiasm into arranging for Winggarden's military industrial complex to grow."
WIN_setup_chiropterran_homes:0 "Chiropterran Military Towns"
WIN_setup_chiropterran_homes_desc:0 "Ocean Spray has argued quite fervently for the adoption of the Chiropterran system of military towns. While it would put certain quarters of the city beyond the other representatives' grasp, it would also, undoubtedly, help to fortify Winggarden in case of an attack."
WIN_seize_hippogriff_companies:0 "Nationalise Hippogriff Companies"
WIN_seize_hippogriff_companies_desc:0 "The local Hippogriff companies are a security risk, one that must be dealt with. While they've by and large played by the rules set forth, they are obvious vectors for the Hippogriffs to attempt to reassert themselves, or at least introduce spies into the city. It'll cause a stir, but they should be nationalized and placed under our control."
WIN_import_experts:0 "Invite Financial Experts"
WIN_import_experts_desc:0 "Many times, the sound advice of financial experts will get hampered by political necessity, but thankfully Winggarden offers more freedom than that. Our far-reaching control along with our sound business laws mean that economic reforms will not only be tolerable, but welcome. It's time we let the world's top financial minds know this."
WIN_the_city_on_the_hill:0 "The City On A Hill"
WIN_the_city_on_the_hill_desc:0 "Winggarden has become something something rarely seen before in this world; a place where competition can reign supreme. Whether competition between our representatives, benefactors, companies or citizens, we all stand tall upon the hill where we built our paradise, and all will scratch and claw their way up that hill for a chance to partake in the prosperity that is the rightful reward of the victors." 
WIN_develop_fuel_stores:0 "The Legation Municipal Fuel Reserve"
WIN_develop_fuel_stores_desc:0 "The ever belligerent Ocean Spray has lobbied quite fervently for the creation of a municipal fuel reserve, arguing that if we are cut off from our trade partners we must be able to rely on our own fuel reserves. This 'dagger to our necks' must be addressed he insists, and of course the fact that it will advance his own goals is surely merely a coincidence." 
WIN_develop_steel_milling:0 "Develop Steel Milling"
WIN_develop_steel_milling_desc:0 "The number one metal of the modern world is not gold or silver, but steel, and Winggarden has the potential to master this metal as well as well. Negotiations with foreign steel companies have already begun, and we have half a dozen companies eagerly bidding for place in the new industrial park designated for the purpose."
WIN_high_rises:0 "The Mile High Club"
WIN_high_rises_desc:0 "Winggarden is a small place, and real estate is hard to come by. The solution is simple; build upwards! Winggarden will become a mountain range of high-rises reaching up against the sky, and in this we will become the very image of the future city, even if we have to expropriate some locals' residences to achieve it."

WIN_the_legaiton_secured:0 "The Free City"
WIN_the_legaiton_secured_desc:0 "The great game of dominance in Winggarden has come to an end not with a bang, but by grinding to a halt. The Legation bureaucracy has crystallized to the point where neither player can subvert it, and Winggarden faces a future that neither of its founders could envision: a future of freedom."
WIN_the_biggest_port:0 "The Staple Port Of Zebrica"
WIN_the_biggest_port_desc:0 "Winggarden can be the gateway to Zebrica, if she only has the space for it. With further expansions of the harbor, our tonnage capacity will be unrivalled. The future looks bright, after all, and we need to prepare for it."
WIN_underwater_hotels:0 "Vertical Development"
WIN_underwater_hotels_desc:0 "Space remains a luxury in our city, and we have already built upwards. It is time to learn from the Hippogriffs and build downwards, into the ocean. Imagine! Hotels and restaurants - an entire tourist complex - situated under the waves, with the beautiful bottom of the sea for a view!"
WIN_naval_aviation_department:0 "The Winggarden Naval Aviation Department"
WIN_naval_aviation_department_desc:0 "As part of our efforts to secure the trading lanes for both us and for our trading partners, Winggarden has acquired a large amount of long distance naval bombers which will let us protect and intervene along the lanes wherever needed."
WIN_legation_mechanisation:0 "Legation Mechanisation"
WIN_legation_mechanisation_desc:0 "The most technologically advanced city in the world should have a military to match. Instead of slogging along by hoof, our soldiers will be able to arrive on the scene in moments, mounted in armored vehicles and striking faster than their enemies can react."
WIN_expand_volunteer_forces:0 "Unite the Volunteer Departments"
WIN_expand_volunteer_forces_desc:0 "Thanks to the legates' bickering, the myriad foreign volunteers have been organized in different, sometimes competing formations. It's a mess, but thankfully we are now in a position where we can try to unravel this twisty knot."
WIN_expand_the_council:0 "Open Up the Council"
WIN_expand_the_council_desc:0 "With the great game no longer being carried out in the halls of power, the time has come to open them to the Hippogriffs as well. There's no point in alienating the local elites, not when they are our neighbors and competitors."
WIN_permit_gatherings:0 "Permit Public Gatherings"
WIN_permit_gatherings_desc:0 "Instability and resentment is bad for business, and this suppression of the marketplace of ideas has gone on for long enough. Let the people have their voice, otherwise they will be out protesting in the streets."
WIN_council_of_corportations:0 "The Corporate Council"
WIN_council_of_corportations_desc:0 "Winggarden exists as a place for commerce and ambition, and in order to ensure these values never are threatened, we will ensure that the major economic powerhouses of our city are well represented in the government."
WIN_allow_political_parties:0 "Into The Shadows"
WIN_allow_political_parties_desc:0 "The power of the legates isn't going anywhere, it's just changing form. The recent unrest meant that reform was needed, but the power is simply moving into the shadows, from which Winggarden's original purpose can still be carried out, only in a more palatable form."
WIN_renegotiate_concessions:0 "Negotiate With the Hippogriffs"
WIN_renegotiate_concessions_desc:0 "Hippogriffia is still resenting the loss of Winggarden. This resentment will not magically vanish, but maybe we can offer them a deal? Giving them a seat a the table and a share in the profits will alleviate their economic woes, and if they in return acknowledge us... well it's the best deal possible, isn't it?"
WIN_further_urban_development:0 "Sky High"
WIN_further_urban_development_desc:0 "We're building higher and higher, and it seems like every day the tallest building in the city changes. This is our pride and joy, our finest monument to Winggarden's prosperity. Redirect plane traffic, reform the building codes to ensure proper safety, restrict personal flight to the boulevards, for Winggarden is growing!"
WIN_rubber_development:0 "The Winggarden Rubber Plant"
WIN_rubber_development_desc:0 "One of Winggarden's strengths is its openness to foreign business, and the newfound stability has brought investors both new and old to our shores. Among these, rubber is one of the hot new commodities. If Wingarden corners the market on synthetic rubber, we will have a product everyone will need."
WIN_legation_CAS:0 "The Legation Bomber Fleet"
WIN_legation_CAS_desc:0 "Winggarden's metropolitan landscape makes it tricky for airplanes to find their targets in case of an attack, but more easily manouvered light bombers or attack planes can manouvre around the skyscrapers if need be, and the boulevards can serve as runways if needed."
WIN_rocketry_development:0 "Changeling Ingenuity"
WIN_rocketry_development_desc:0 "We are a city that welcomes the ambitious, and the Changelings are no exception. It's strange how few are giving them a chance, but their loss is our gain, especially when some of these changeling expatriates turn out to be rocket scientists."
WIN_just_like_pegas:0 "The Las Pegasus Of Zebrica"
WIN_just_like_pegas_desc:0 "Winggarden is a centre of commerce, but its entertainment industry is booming as well. The trade will flow either way, so maybe it would behoove us to focus on making sure that all of north Zebrica knows that Winggarden is the place to come to for a good time?"
WIN_just_like_skyfall:0 "The Skyfall Of Zebrica"
WIN_just_like_skyfall_desc:0 "Any merchant worth their salt knows how Skyfall has become a cliché when speaking of a successful business centre. We can at least aim to spare Zebrica from the constant nattering about Skyfall, and we shall do so by supplanting it as the heart of international commerce across north Zebrica."
WIN_the_atomic_age:0 "The Age Of the Atom"
WIN_the_atomic_age_desc:0 "The new frontier of scientific development is in the atom, and the applications for this new technology are countless. And after all, what is Winggarden if not a haven for the experimental and the modern? Time to start experimenting on atomic level as well."

WIN_the_wingbardian_takeover:0 "Unfortunate Circumstances"
WIN_the_wingbardian_takeover_desc:0 "The Great Project has collapsed, it now falls to the remains of the Wingbardian Legation to salvage what it can from the city, and adapt a new plan to fit their old mission. For King and Country, it shall be done."
WIN_advisors_not_rulers:0 "Advisors, Not Rulers"
WIN_advisors_not_rulers_desc:0 "The Hippogriffs will never accept Wingbardian rule, and without Chiropterran muscle, we can never keep true control as kings in all but name. So we need to find a willing pawn, someone who can run the state for the Legation. Perhaps a local fascist will do?"
WIN_fascist_propaganda:0 "The Action"
WIN_fascist_propaganda_desc:0 "Winggarden is still in a state of chaos, the citizens are looking for something to turn to, an idea to grasp onto. "The Action", the newspaper publication of Silversliver's party shall be spread all across the city by Wingbardian agents, the people must know the truths of the world."
WIN_hippogriff_blackshirts:0 "The Winggarden Blackwings"
WIN_hippogriff_blackshirts_desc:0 "While the NUHF has maintained an unofficial paramilitary force for a while, it is time to officialize it. The new Blackwings, named after their brother in organization in Wingbardy, shall be a shining beacon of culture, strength, and power for all Hippogriffs to look up to."
WIN_the_hippogriff_duce:0 "The Wingsington Square Rally"
WIN_the_hippogriff_duce_desc:0 "It is time for the great Zephyr Silversliver to make his entrance into the public eye, many already know of him, but it is time for an official grand appearance. Carefully stagemanaged to make him appear as mighty as possible, he is the peak of Fascist culture, and he wishes for all Hippogriffs to rally around him and have unity in purpose and belief."
WIN_find_willing_corporate_collaborators:0 "Corporate Collaboration"
WIN_find_willing_corporate_collaborators_desc:0 "Our position is still fragile, but we still have one thing to use. The old Legation treasury along with Wingbardian funding. So, we must bring in allies, there are many companies across Hippogriffia who may be open to working with us if it makes them a profit. Right now we don't care if they are true fascists or not, we need support and we need prosperity."
WIN_wingbardian_investment:0 "Wingbardian Investment"
WIN_wingbardian_investment_desc:0 "Many corporations from Wingbardy have shown an interest in setting up shop in Winggarden, with some funding we can secure a new supply line for goods for our administration, and try and keep ourselves afloat in a hostile land."
WIN_utilise_the_SIM:0 "SIM Information Network"
WIN_utilise_the_SIM_desc:0 "The Wingbardian Intelligence service still has a strong presence in Winggarden, and are ready to strike out at our enemies from the shadows. We just need to give them a target first."
WIN_help_rebuild:0 "Hearts And Minds"
WIN_help_rebuild_desc:0 "The fall of the legation was marred with violence and destruction from both the occupying powers and the citizens of Winggarden. This can not continue, we shall feed and clothe the people to show them that the fascists are nothing to fear. Our Wingbardian comrades are here to help, and the NUHF are the new protectors of the city. All the other politicians lied to you, Zephyr will not."
WIN_the_torch_of_fascism:0 "The Torch Of Fascism In Zebrica"
WIN_the_torch_of_fascism_desc:0 "It is time now to march, not against the occupiers of Winggarden, but with our saviors from Wingbardy. It is them who brought the light of Fascism to Hippogriffia, but they can not do the job for us any longer. They are passing us the torch now, the beautiful light of pure Fascist ideals, and Zephyr Silversliver will bear that torch, and he shall lead Hippogriffia into a bright Fascist future."

WIN_fascism_rising:0 "Hail To The Commandant"
WIN_fascism_rising_desc:0 "Silversliver delivered us from the chaos of the legation collapse into a bright new fascist future. All hail the commandant! May he continue to guide us forward, free of the shackles of tradition!"
WIN_repair_the_shipyards:0 "Revitalise The Winggardian Shipyards"
WIN_repair_the_shipyards_desc:0 "If we are to match the anti-fascist enemy, then we will need to battle them on the high seas. Our patrons can only do so much to help us, a pure Hippogriffian fleet must challenge the monarchists at sea, the domain of half of our citizens."
WIN_integrate_the_seadwellers:0 "Submarine Mining Initiative"
WIN_integrate_the_seadwellers_desc:0 "The vast undersea has an abundance of natural resources that could be used to serve the national interest. Combining our natural affinity for the ocean with new drilling technology, we can extract from the deep what we need to throw back the reactionary monarchists."
WIN_repair_the_fleet:0 "Repurpose The Legation Fleet"
WIN_repair_the_fleet_desc:0 "The Legation Fleet was captured after the brief battle for the metropolis. It will be key to our eventual control of the oceans surrounding Hippogriffia, and the start of something much greater."
WIN_underwater_fascism:0 "The Association Of Sequestrian Fascists"
WIN_underwater_fascism_desc:0 "The seaponies are tired of living under the crushing pressure of tradition, and are flocking to our movement in record numbers. We should send the Commandant down to Seaquestria, in seapony form, to organize this undersea fascist vanguard."
WIN_request_the_islands:0 "Request The Six Isles"
WIN_request_the_islands_desc:0 "Now that we have brought the glory of fascism to Winggarden, there is no need for Wingbardy to administer the Six Isles directly. Reclaiming these isles, even if it is through diplomacy rather than violence, would stoke the fervour of our people and lend legitimacy to our government."
WIN_fascist_corporatism:0 "The Nine Corporations"
WIN_fascist_corporatism_desc:0 "Corporatism is the most advanced, the most efficient, the most revolutionary system of economics ever devised. We will implement this system in Winggarden, sanctioning nine corporations of employers and workers to represent and govern the major sectors of our economy."
WIN_class_reconciliation:0 "Class Reconciliation"
WIN_class_reconciliation_desc:0 "Every true fascist knows that the passion of your soul determines your worth, not your place in some materialistic production chain! We will promote collaboration and cooperation between the classes, with all directing their energies towards the most fervent objects of their passions, rather than towards sterile class interest."
WIN_rebuilding_the_city:0 "The City Of Springs And Gardens"
WIN_rebuilding_the_city_desc:0 "Our city shall be one of culture and creation, a perfect Fascist city in all regards. The architecture shall fuse art, culture, and the warrior spirit of our people into every brick layed and every wall built. For if one does not live their life surrounded by fascism, then they have failed spiritually."
WIN_scaling_taxation:0 "From Each For All"
WIN_scaling_taxation_desc:0 "The old tax system of the legation completely excluded the financial classes from the burdens of taxation in the service of commercial interests. While we seek to form our own relation with the corporations, we do need the revenue for our own purposes. So, a new scaling income tax shall be put in place to ensure everyone gives all they can to support the nation."
WIN_embrace_syndicalist_militarism:0 "The Death Of Bourgeoise Decadence"
WIN_embrace_syndicalist_militarism_desc:0 "The rich hoard everything they can in their ivory towers while leaving the poor to die in the dirt. While we are glad to ensure a right to wealth, the decadence of the wealthy, their greed and perversion of the fascist spirit, cannot go on. They do nothing with their wealth besides earn more wealth, so we shall do something better with it."
WIN_empower_the_intellectuals:0 "Empower The Intellectual, Unshackle The Poet"
WIN_empower_the_intellectuals_desc:0 "The theorists of society are the most revered class of all. For without them, we would still be living in the muck and dust of the darkest ages. Without their revolutionary ideas, fascism would have never come to be. We would still be chained down in the ancient customs of centuries long past. For this, we must let them continue their eternal work."
WIN_the_superior_individuals:0 "The Tenth Corporation"
WIN_the_superior_individuals_desc:0 "Commandant Silversliver has proposed another brilliant idea: the establishment of a symbolic Tenth Corporation, to represent the poets, the artists, the visionaries, the dreamers, in short the superior people whom our movement exists for."
WIN_embrace_the_perfection_of_intellect:0 "Cogito Ergo Sum"
WIN_embrace_the_perfection_of_intellect_desc:0 "The researcher, the intellectual, and wise griff. These are those who advance society. Those who create the technology of tomorrow, and push civilization forward. The great 10th Corporation shall serve foremost to represent the interests of these great researchers, ensuring they have the funding to persue any and all research they may wish to conduct."
WIN_embrace_the_perfection_of_art:0 "To Feel Is To Understand"
WIN_embrace_the_perfection_of_art_desc:0 "Art and music gives meaning to life. Without these mediums of pleasure to enjoy, what point is there to living? The Artists have for thousands of years given purpose to the lives of the hippogriffs. For this service, and their continued prosperity, we grant them dominion over the 10th Corporation."
WIN_the_grand_council:0 "The Grand Council Of Fascism"
WIN_the_grand_council_desc:0 "The Grand Council of Fascism shall be the beating heart of our nation state. Those who are educated in the wise ways of fascist theory and know how to apply it to the state at large."
WIN_embrace_the_future:0 "The Futurist Manifesto"
WIN_embrace_the_future_desc:0 "We are today moving beyond the past faster than we ever have before. The pace of the advancement of society is increasing exponentially, and fascism will only serve to accelerate this evolution. Who knows what the world will look like in 50 to 100 years. Or rather, we know one thing at least. It shall be a fascist world. Oh and no pasta."
WIN_the_seven_rectors:0 "The Seven Rectors"
WIN_the_seven_rectors_desc:0 "The seven rectors govern the seven great schools of art, and are given authority to promote the ideals of fascism within their respective fields so that the innovation of the fascist nation will never die."
WIN_revolt_against_tradition:0 "Revolt Against Tradition"
WIN_revolt_against_tradition_desc:0 "The traditions of the past are mere chains upon our spirit! The monarchy and institutions like it have held the nation back for far too long. We cannot be held back by notions of morality and subjective "good" and "evil." The fascist state has no such use for these outdated concepts."
WIN_the_warrior_spirit:0 "The Warrior Spirit Of Aviandom"
WIN_the_warrior_spirit_desc:0 "As hippogriffs, we are brothers to the great warriors of Griffonia, going all the way back to the great Arantigos. Legend says, one of his generals even took refuge in far away Hippogriffia and taught us ways of war. This spirit lives strong within us, and it forms the core of who we are."
WIN_the_poet_inside:0 "The Poeticism Of Equinity"
WIN_the_poet_inside_desc:0 "Across the world, equines are the greatest creators. And we, as hippogriffs share in this power to craft and create with our minds and souls. It is said in legend by some mystics that a primordial pony spirit gave up her divinity to grant hippogriffs this great power. We alone can carry this mantle, and we fascists are ready to rise to the task."
WIN_the_avian_ideal:0 "The Perfection Of The Equino-Avianic Form"
WIN_the_avian_ideal_desc:0 "We are the perfect fusion of equine and avian. The hippogriff is the creature most spiritually ready to accept the truth of fascism, and it is our duty and calling to spread it to all of our brothers and sisters."
WIN_exalt_violence:0 "Exalt Violence"
WIN_exalt_violence_desc:0 "What better way is there to live life than violently? Free from the constraints of failed moral codes and ancient standards of behavior. We are a free people! And we shall not be chained by failed despots and lecherous cretins, we shall live as we were meant to!"
WIN_fascism_is_revolutionary:0 "The Revolutionary Fascist Ideal"
WIN_fascism_is_revolutionary_desc:0 "We are the heralds of the new world order. A more free world where the culture of fascism means that every creature can live better than their parents did. A world constantly marching proudly into the future has always been, and will always be, the end goal."

WIN_the_free_city_desc:0 "Well horseapples, we've finally done it. We've found a place just crazy enough that I can put my ideas into practice. And I have a lot of ideas." #horseapples is apparently a curse
WIN_marketplace_of_ideas:0 "The Marketplace Of Ideas"
WIN_marketplace_of_ideas_desc:0 "We're going to make this place somewhere where any creature can come in with an idea, and walk out with either a no strings attached pile of cash to make it happen, or squat. If it's a good enough idea, we'll take it, we need everything we can get to fight against this world of tyrants."
WIN_foreign_ties:0 "Foreign Business Ties"
WIN_foreign_ties_desc:0 "Over my years in the business I've known a lot of wealthy creatures, never cared for most of them, but they have the bits. And now that I own this city, well I'm in a better contract negotiating position than I've ever been in before. Time to open up the gates of commerce."
WIN_actual_plasmids:0 "The Plasmid Project"
WIN_actual_plasmids_desc:0 "A Kirin biologist from Yale showed me this paper he wrote a good few years ago, when I was contracting some mercs for the Empire. He swore to me that there were these little genetic blips all over our bodies that gave us the abilities we say are "magical." I think the bucker called'em "plasmids" or something dumb like that. I think he's still kicking, let's invite him home."
WIN_gateway_to_zebrica:0 "The Gateway To Zebrica"
WIN_gateway_to_zebrica_desc:0 "There's only one place that deserves to be Zebrica's staple port. And that's Winggarden, we've got the freest markets, the freest people, and the best investors. Whether you're transporting fruit or trafficking weapons, my city's the place to do it. Just make sure to pay for security."
WIN_urban_redevelopment:0 "Urban Renewal"
WIN_urban_redevelopment_desc:0 "Damn, those Legates really bucked this place up. All full of barracks and forts, like they can try to control a free people. Well, it falls to me and the guys to fix this place up. I want real estate and development companies on the line ASAP, I have great ideas for this place, I'll call it Coffee Street."
WIN_abolish_the_business_tax:0 "The Single Tax Policy"
WIN_abolish_the_business_tax_desc:0 "Taxes are dumb, I've always known that, and gods willing, I could be done with them forever. But I need to run a country now, so I'll keep it simple. If you own land in Winggarden, I can tax you for that. Nothing else. Go wild and let the market guide y'all." #You have one single tax, the tax for being a citizen 
WIN_social_liberation:0 "Social Liberalisation"
WIN_social_liberation_desc:0 "A restrained market comes from a restrained citizenry. I've been all over the world, and anywhere creatures suffer from poverty and a lack of freedom, it's always because the government tells them how to live their lives. Well to tartarus with that! Thou shalt do what thou wilt! I couldn't care less."
WIN_nightwatch_state:0 "The Nightwatchgriff State"
WIN_nightwatch_state_desc:0 "We want the market to judge who is fit to prosper here in Winggarden, the issue is that those who fail in this regard often get a bit uppity and decide to beat the snot out of whoever was simply better than them. If there's only one thing this little government I'm setting up should do, it's prevent that."
WIN_harmonise_laws:0 "The Libertarian Charter"
WIN_harmonise_laws_desc:0 "All the work we've done is fine and dandy, but we need to put it all in writing. I've worked for a solid... three hours on writing our governing charter, and then I've been bored out of my mind for the last sixteen while my associates "make it make sense," a bunch of bums they are. But as long as it stays true to my ideas, it'll work great."
WIN_regulations_begone:0 "Economic Deregulation"
WIN_regulations_begone_desc:0 "Monitoring how businesses operate is useless. You either stifle their profits and force creatures into poverty, or you make them angry, and they start doing "crimes." As long as the local butcher isn't murdering his neighbor in the streets, we have no reason to regulate business practices. Their money is their own to make."
WIN_allow_vice:0 "Drugs, Sex And Rock And Roll"
WIN_allow_vice_desc:0 "Drugs, alcohol, music, and all the lovely things that come with it. These have been probably the most lucrative trades throughout all of history. Some even say the first trades. The regimes of the world fear their power and influence, because they control the people through flimsy moral codes and legal regulations. Here in Winggarden, we don't fear these things. We enjoy them a lot—all of them."
WIN_the_right_to_happiness:0 "The Principle Of Equality"
WIN_the_right_to_happiness_desc:0 "This one's pretty simple. Every creature in Winggarden is equal to every other creature. I don't care who the buck you are, I care if you want to pay me or not."
WIN_the_great_city:0 "A Truly Free City"
WIN_the_great_city_desc:0 "Well, I did it. The city's bustling like never before, and I've made a whole lot of money. I'm pretty bucking good at this now that I think about it. I should reward myself with a nice drink down at the new club, make some new mare friends. Try to enjoy myself for a bit. Since there's a lot more work still to be done."
WIN_the_open_door_policy:0 "Land Of Opportunity"
WIN_the_open_door_policy_desc:0 "In Winggarden, anyone can be at home. If you can make it here, you can damn well make it anywhere. Why would I ever try to stop you? The market decided you were good for my city, so I'm going to let you stay."
WIN_the_libertalia_experiment:0 "The Dream Of Libertalia"
WIN_the_libertalia_experiment_desc:0 "This'll be the big test, if everything I've accomplished is going to work. I'm bored with just this city, I want something more. The Hippogriffs are suffering, they lost the war against the leatherwings and their allies, and their government couldn't do anything to help them. They should see by now that we're the better option. We can give them real freedom. For Libertalia!" #*snorts line of cocaine* It's bucking go time baby.
WIN_work_with_the_hippogriffs:0 "Abolish The Invisible Ceiling"
WIN_work_with_the_hippogriffs_desc:0 "The Legates and their tyrant daddies feared the hippogriffs, they feared their fighting spirit, their want for freedom. They're creatures just the same as the rest of us, and with the failure of their Queen and Equestrianist """harmony""" it'll be easy to make them come around to our way of thinking. They'll make great business partners too."
WIN_non_interventionism:0 "Set The Market Free"
WIN_non_interventionism_desc:0 "We don't want to intervene in the market. That's boring and obstructive. The will of the market is the best way to run an economy, and us having any hoof in it is just going to make it worse."
WIN_freedom_of_information:0 "Freedom Of Information"
WIN_freedom_of_information_desc:0 "Press censorship is the step before market regulation. Control the information, and the people will never know how free they can truly be. So, I'm going to make sure the reporters and the whistleblowers will never be silenced. And maybe start a newspaper while I'm at it."
WIN_decentralized_education:0 "Notchian Education"
WIN_decentralized_education_desc:0 "Education mandated by a government is a stupid idea. A citizen isn't allowed to wake up one morning and say "I want to work with my hooves and my heart" and go off and be a construction worker or something. So we're going to make a new education model. You don't need to go to school, but if you do, you need to show what you're worth. Then a company can sponsor your studies. I swear it's perfect."
WIN_abolish_the_volunteer_force:0 "Abolish The Legation Volunteer Force"
WIN_abolish_the_volunteer_force_desc:0 "The Legation "volunteers" were tools of foreign dictatorships. Not a native Winggardener among them, and they had the gall to try and keep the citizens down. Idiots. All of them. Military service is an investment in your future, all us mercs know that. So service in... service... of our... not-state will be on a volunteer only basis.\nGods I need a drink."
WIN_expand_bean_presence:0 "Bean Security Proliferation"
WIN_expand_bean_presence_desc:0 "If we're to guard our little experiment here, we need some more bodies. I'll call in all my trusted associates. Taffy, Hans, even du Trot. I'll call them all and they'll bring their boys. We'll protect this place by the market and for the market. Just need to make sure my bank account stays full."
WIN_localised_militias:0 "The Right To Bear Arms"
WIN_localised_militias_desc:0 "Freedom from tyranny does not mean freedom from threat. All our citizens deserve to have the absolute right to self-defense, and this includes all weapons from antique Lake City katanas to a nuke for all I care. For recreation or defense, it's all allowed. Hopefully, they'll enjoy this freedom, and be ready to take up arms when the time comes. For the right price of course."
WIN_mercenary_expertise:0 "Soldiers Of Fortune"
WIN_mercenary_expertise_desc:0 "I've worked with a lot of other merc firms over the years. All fine folks, except the ones that aren't. But that doesn't matter now. What matters is we need guns, ammo, creatures, and creatures with guns. And these contacts are going to get them all for me."
WIN_quality_over_quantity:0 "In The Defence Of Liberty"
WIN_quality_over_quantity_desc:0 "These mercs we've been calling in are starting to settle down. It's easy to see why they like it here, a city built by a merc for people like us.

### Events ###
legation.1.t:0 "The Birth Of The Legation City"
legation.1.d:0 "As he lit up a cigar and leaned back in his comfy chair, Gilippo Gappi could hardly keep himself from smiling. Puffs of smoke drifted upward, and the griffon mentally pat himself on the shoulder.\n\nHe deserved it, after all. His ingenious idea, Winggarden, an international city of unlimited potential, his legacy to future generations, had actually come to fruition.\n\nHe had had to call in all the favours he’d accumulated over the years so to have a seat at the negotiating table, that was true, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs back in Karthin had been timid at first to the idea. Those bureaucrats saw little to be gained from a continued involvement in Zebrica. Unless it was Abyssinia, of course.\n\nGappi scoffed contemptuously. Why waste energy and blood in bringing an arid land to heel when Aris was just there, bloodily beaten and ripe for the taking? The fame that Winggarden was about to shower him with would outshine anything else, and the wealth extracted from it would silence all the nay-sayers.\n\nGlancing down upon his desk, his wandering eyes caught the two dossiers laying there. He realized he shouldn’t have done so, as his good mood waned a bit. Sharing his project with somegriff else had not seemed like anything to worry about at first, but now? That might prove a problem in the long run. He would need to tread carefully from now on, but Gappi was confident. With some luck and skill, the Legation could work.\n\nAfter all, there would doubtlessly be plenty of money for all those involved. And if experience had taught him anything, was that money was an excellent incentive to keep things stable.\n\nShaking his head, Gappi went back to enjoying his expensive Sicameon-made cigar. He refused to let those thoughts ruin his perfectly good mood; instead, the griffon focused his attention to the promising future that waited for him.\n\nHe had already received overtures from many Wingbardian companies, so that they could tap into the novel market that was the Legation City.\n\nAnd, as the soon-to-be Legate, he could afford himself to be choosy."
legation.1.a:0 "Let the money flow!"

legation.2.t:0 "The Start Of Something Beautiful"
legation.2.d:0 ""Absolutely no! I don’t care how sensible you may believe it is, I will not allow it. And that’s the end of it!" Zillqat Zaladid snarled, eyes narrowed in fury. He was standing now with both hooves planted firmly upon the roundtable. If Sonar Beep was to take a guess from the way his eyebrow kept on twitching, the Colthaginian was on the brink of smashing it.\n\nSo, she wisely decided to remain silent, waiting for Zaladid’s anger to subside. Eventually, it worked. The stallion sat back in his chair with a tired sigh and took another sip from his teacup.\n\n"He’s right, you know," Gevese said. The griffon took one last pull from his cigarette before smothering it in an ashtray.\n\n"It’s not that I don’t see the necessity of it, mind you. Unlike dear Zaladin here, I find it quite reasonable. In fact, I would be in favour to it." He feigned not to notice the ugly look thrown his way by the Colthaginian. "However, I’m afraid that a centralized command it’s not applicable at the moment. My own troops will refuse following a foreigner, no matter what the chain of command says. Especially after last week."\n\nDespite her disappointment, Sonar Beep made an effort to nod solemnly. It had been a long shot anyway. There was little hope in trying to implement a system of command and control similar to the Chiropterran one, no matter how much Ocean Spray insisted. The military forces in the city were simply too heterogenous and would not accept being placed under a unified command.\n\nEspecially Ocean Spray’s.\n\n"I understand the issue. If this is your final answer, then I will not push it any further," Sonar Beep said. Then, she smiled politely. "I do however propose a compromise. A more decentralized structure, combined with a joint council of all high-ranking military personnel. It would be flexible, and a good foundation for further improvement."\n\nHer Colthaginian and Wingbardian colleague seemed to mull over the proposition for a bit. Gevese was the first to answer, "That is acceptable. Just please, make sure that legate of yours doesn’t order us to shell protesters with mortars again. I nearly got a mutiny on my claws.""
legation.2.a:0 "It's a start..."

legation.3.t:0 "A Night Out"
legation.3.d:0 "Zillquat took another long sip from his blonde beer, before loudly putting it back down with a smack. How that poor glass has survived that much mistreatment for the last two hours, none could be really sure.\n\n"So, no shit, there we were," Zillquat continued, eyes bright with elation, "cut off from the main body, short on ammunition, and with the bloody Coltvans closing in from all sides. Quite the situation, eh? And if that wasn’t enough, our commanding officer had decided to be a complete moron and order a full-on frontal assault, because no matter the situation, it can always get worse."\n\nSonar Beep listened carefully, eyes wide, her own drink forgotten by her side. Not a million year she would have expected this, but there it was. The usually rough-mannered and reserved Colthaginian could get quite talkative after a drink or two. And by the Nightmare, he really didn’t want to stop anytime soon.\n\n"What did you do then?" Gevese asked, before taking another pull from his cigarette.\n\nZillquat smiled impishly. "Well, given the situation, I decided that drastic action was required. So, I bucked the idiot right in the head. And you’ll never guess, the little shit wet himself too!"\n\nRaucous laughter exploded around the table. Even the usually stone-faced Marble Pillar smiled, only for a brief moment though. "So anyway, that’s the story of how I got my first command. General Beep, it’s your turn."\n\n"Really? I thought it was Gevese’s."\n\n"Oh no," the griffon shook his head. "Mine is the embarrassing one, so we are leaving the best for last, as we’ve agreed."\n\nSonar Beep nodded. "I guess that’s fair." She took a long sip from her beverage as an encouragement, then she began. "Alright so, first of all, I want to point out that what I’m about to say it’s one-hundred percent true. Ask Marble Pillar here if you don’t believe me."\n\n"Oh dear Nightmare," the other thestral groaned, "you want to tell them about that time, don't you?" That gained the attention of every creature at the table.\n\nSadly, when the Winggarden General Staff woke up the next morning, half of them with a splitting headache, none could quite remember what the story was about. That proved to be not that big of an issue though; they would all agree afterward that, whatever the subject was, it had been probably hilarious."
legation.3.a:0 "Thank the Nightmare we're here!"

legation.4.t:0 "My Chemical Romance"
legation.4.d:0 "Deep within the tunnels below Winggarden, a group of military officers runs down a dimly lit hallway. Once one of the city's defensive redoubts against invasion, this tunnel network now serves as the paths by which the Legation military quickly moves about the city. And storming down corridor 3c, with papers in hoof, comes generals Marble Pillar and Sonar Beep. Inbound on room 14, also known as "The Nightmare Chamber," the office of Ocean Spray.\n\nEntering the room with a slam of the door, the figures already in the room turn to face them. Generals Zaladid and Gevese had already arrived and were speaking with Ocean Spray, after a couple of quick salutes the Chiropterrans place down the papers they'd been holding. Detailed maps of what was going on in the city. For the first time in the Legation's history, there was an organized mass protest on the streets. The shock of losing the war had kept the Hippogriffs tame for a while, but now they were back and angry.\n\nGeneral Pillar began, "They've occupied some of the main boulevards, the port, and the plaza around city hall. Gilippo is under siege in there and needs to be relieved. We've been preparing for this day for a while now, and we need to act fast. His guards can only hold out so long. I, for one, favor a strike operation to get him out, followed by a conventional surround tactic up Lunar Road and starving the protest out. They'll back down eventually. Zaladid then spoke up, "These protesters will be at our necks if we let them stay around any longer. We need to march a single column up the street, and they will part and let us through to Gappi. Or we will make them."\n\nThe commanders debated for a minute, not quite coming to a consensus before Ocean Spray himself lifted a hoof, "Gentlecreatures, the solution here is simple. A few days ago, I received a personal gift from my Lady Commander Emerald Light, which we can use to sort out this issue nice and quick." The commanders around Spray leaned in, intrigued what the Chiropterran representative had received. "We have been blessed by the Nightmare," Spray triumphantly declared, "with a shipment of methylphosphonofluoridate."\n\nThe generals stood for a moment, unsure what Ocean Spray meant. Reading the room, he explained, "Also known as sarin gas." At this, the room exploded, general Gevese spit out the coffee and began to curse wildly in his native tongue. Zaladid slammed his hoof on the desk and exclaimed, "Are you insane! Are you recommending we unleash a nerve agent on the population of the city! In the middle of the government district!" "By the Nightmare, I am general!" Spray responded. As their voices rose, a crack shot up in the air as general Sonar Beep fired a blank out of his pistol into the air. "Representative Spray! You are not a military officer, the use of sarin gas on the population will not be authorized. Though if I remember, you also received tear gas in that shipment. Something much more appropriate for the situation. We must act fast, I move we authorize the police to use this tear gas to disperse the protestors, and then we move in to get Gappi out of there. All in favor?"\n\nAll in the room besides Spray raised their hooves and claws. "Passed. Now let's get moving.""
legation.4.a:0 "Did somepony give him his pills for the day?"

legation.5.t:0 "On Patrol"
legation.5.d:0 "The two massive police officers - one griffon and one thestral - slowly strode down the street, both of them clad in heavy combat armor and carrying massive twelve milimeter rifles. Neither of them seemed overly encumbered by it either, and as they approached, hippogriffs, ponies and zebras all got out of the way in fear. The street market had been bustling, but now it was near empty, with only the occasional stall owners trying desperately to pack their wares up and step out of the way. One of the stall owners dropped a box of fruits, one of them rolling over the pavement and coming to a stop right in front of the leading griffon, who stopped and stared the shall owner down before picking up the orange.\n\n"Your papers, citizen?" the griffon asked, his voice rumbling inside the massive armor. The hippogriff backed away in fear at first, but the sight of the massive weapons made him dismiss any thought of fleeing, and he slowly walked behind the stall and took out his papers, which the thestral took and looked over, putting the orange back in the box.\n\n"These permits are due for renewal," the thestral informed him, the hippogriff stammering out an apology before being cut off. "Also, while you apply, make sure to ask for a AV-11 permit regarding fresh fruit, it was only signed into law a week ago, and may have missed it."\n\n"I-um... yes..." the Hippogriff began, trailing off.\n\n"Make sure to inform your fellow salescreatures of this as well," the griffon told him, "This market has done a lot of good for the local community, and it would be a shame to see it closed down. We will be patrolling here regularly, so do not hesitate to ask us if you have any questions. We are based at 5th Claw and Beak, and all relevant forms can be found there. Is there anything else you need, citizen?"\n\n"I don't think so?" the hippogriff didn't know what to think of this entire thing. The two officers simply nodded in response.\n\n"Good day, citizen," the thestral said as they began down the street again, leaving the market goers and stall owners to peek out from their hiding spots after the pair."

legation.6.d:0 ""You are the hammer that will crush all that stand before the legation authorities!" The thestral thundered as he walked back and forth in front of the black-clothed, heavily armored police officers, "Like a dagger, you will cut to the very heart of those who stand defiant, wreaking such havoc that-"\n\nBAP! his voice was cut off as the baton hit his leg and he gasped in pain, clutching his leg as he hobbled to the side, revealing the police chief that had come up behind him.\n\n"What he MEANT TO SAY..." the police chief said patiently, glaring at the police captain as he nursed his bruised leg, "Is that as part of our policing strategy, we aim to keep the regular officers for regular police work, and deploy the elite - you - for situations that exceed their capacities. Hostage situations, armed robberies, crazed mages, and so forth." The captain had recovered by now and came up to continue.\n\n"And to this end, you must be ready to wreak the ultimate violence upon all that stand before you. Give neither quarter nor mercy, for-"BAP!\n\n"He MEANS that you must above all else be disciplined and predictable in the field. Those who resist must be subdued, those who use lethal force must be neutralized, those who comply must be safe. There cannot be any doubt among the citizenry about what will lead to what. If they play along, they are safe, if they don't, they will be dealt with."\n\n"And above all else!" The captain began again, "Remember that you are instruments of vengeance-"BAP!\n\n"Of law and order..." the chief sighed. "When you are deployed, you are still police officers, and a successful deployment will not only deal with the issue at hoof, but it will also impress the population and show them just how capable the WPD is. This will inspire confidence, and confidence in the police will-"BAP! The captain had barely even opened his mouth this time. "-lead to trust. Each and every one here will have the highest standards placed on them for that reason. The eyes of the world will be upon you, and if we do well, we will be the vanguard of a new era. Good luck, officers.""

legation.7.t:0 "The Meeting"
legation.7.d:0 ""Very well, mares and gentlecolts. Listen up," Marble Pillar began, on hoof pointed on the map spread across the table. The most prominent members of the newly established Defence Council had been summoned there and, much to Marble Pillar satisfaction, they had answered it without hesitation.\n\n"Through various means, the Security Service managed to pinpoint the location of one of the most prominent resistance hubs in the city. The targets are various warehouses near the waterfront, and we suspect they’re currently being used to house imported weaponry."\n\n"What’s the enemy strength?" Gevese asked from his seat, eyes never leaving the map. "I mean numbers and equipment as well. Who are we dealing with?"\n\n"Sonar Beep?" Marble glanced toward her colleague.\n\n"Yes, of course. The group seem to be quite heterogenous; hippogriff nationalists, harmonists, communists, you name it. I believe some local libertarians as well. Total strength is around forty to fifty fighters, according to our most conservative estimates. Weaponry is varied, but they shouldn’t have any heavy weapons."\n\nFrom the opposite side of the table, Zaladid nodded solemnly. Then he spoke, "I propose a decisive assault. A couple of my Chargers teams should be more than enough to get inside, and the rest of our forces can follow shortly after. If we hit quickly, they won’t have the time to form a cohesive defence."\n\n"Agreed," Gevese said. He produced a pencil and proceeded to highlight some spots on the city map, all of them around the target. "From here and here, I can have clear lines of fire for my specialists. If any of them tries so much as peaking their ugly mug outside, they’ll get a crater through the head."\n\n"Boxed in like rats, uh?" Zaladid chuckled. "Fitting. I like your way of thinking."\n\n"Yes, but please keep in mind that our is a police action, not a military one," Sonar Beep pointed out quickly. "Our foremost concern should be to subdue them, if possible. I’m sure that precious intel can be extracted once they’re in my custody." Then, she grinned. "My colts from the S.W.A.T. will help in the operation and perform clearing actions together with your troops."\n\nThe Colthaginian nodded. "Fine by me." From nearby, Gevese nodded as well, then smiled. "I always wanted to see your department in action anyway. It’ll be interesting for sure."\n\n"Very well, enough of the chatter." Marble Pillar announced, glancing to each member of Defence Council in turn. "We have a target and a decided course of action. Now, let’s go. We’ve got a job to do.""

legation.8.t:0 "The Arrival Of The Volunteers"
legation.8.d:0 "Marble Pillar stood still, her face an unreadable mask; the only indication that she was in fact not a stone statue was the occasional movement from her eyes. Aside from that, she was utterly silent as the newly arrived Wingbardian contingent marched down the docks, the griffons coming to a perfectly-executed, synchronized stop before her, weapons by their side.\n\nHer glances were however directed not only to them, but also to the colleague beside her. Unlike Marble, Gevese had his beak split into a wide excited grin as he observed the assembled troops.\n\nOfficially, Marble Pillar was there to prove the ‘Chiropterran unwavering commitment to the security and stability of Winggarden’. Unofficially, however, Ocean Spray distrusted anypony that wasn’t his own (more or less) and had ordered both her and Sonar Beep to keep an eye close to the incoming volunteers, so to gauge their readiness as allies and, should the worst indeed come to pass, potential enemies. Much to her surprise, Gevese didn’t seem to mind of her being there.\n\nA cadre of officers from the contingent approached the two, stopping a few steps short and snapping to attention. Marble Pillar saluted back, and hers was a perfect one, born from years of experience. Gevese mimicked her gesture ... and then, to Pillar’s absolute horror, he hugged the leading officer of the group.\n\n"Giovanni! Good to see you and the others here," he exclaimed with evident delight. "It has been a long time, hasn’t it?"\n\nThe griffon officer grinned back. "Yessir, it has been. My congratulations on your promotion, by the way. Though many of the guys and gals still miss their old commander."\n\n"Promotion?" Gevese barked a laugh. "Oh, I wish it was that, trust me! Still, Winggarden is not too bad. Better than Abyssinia, that’s for sure."\n\nTilting his head toward the mare, he added, "May I present you my colleague, General Marble Pillar of the Chiropterran contingent. I’m confident you’ll show her the same courtesy you do to me."\n\n"Of course, sir. Ma’am," Giovanni said, snapping to attention a second time. Still a bit bewildered by the sudden disregard of protocol, Marble Pillar settled herself to a quick, stiff nod as an answer.\n\n"But enough with formalities. I’ll leave you and the lads some time to settle in. After that, how about we grab something to drink, and you tell me what you’ve been up to since Falcor?" His grin widened. "First round on me, of course."\n\nEvery creature present agreed quite enthusiastically on the idea. Of course, every creature aside from a very confused, and mildly infuriated, Marble Pillar."

legation.9.t:0 "The Flycolts"
legation.9.d:0 ""Why is his bigger?"\n\nWithin the vast hangar, the question echoed much louder than anycreature would have liked. Sonar Beep immediately looked up from her paperclip in shock, a shade of pink on her face. Gevese, who had been conversing with some of the newly arrived pilots but a moment before, stopped dead in his track. He turned around, not quite believing what he had just heard.\n\nMarble Pillar was the first to break the uncomfortable silence, a disapproving frown on her face. "General Zillquat, would you please repeat that?" Somewhere behind, a few from the bomber crew snickered.\n\n"Of course I will," Zillquat replied. He raised an accusing hoof toward his Wingbardian colleague. "Why is his bigger than mine?" The chuckles from the aircrews present got a bit louder.\n\nGevese blinked, slowly. "I ... my apologies. I was just not expecting to hear that from you." The griffon shrugged and let out a soft chuckle. "Admittedly, I do hear such comments once in a while." Some distance away, Sonar Beep let out a soft wheeze, only to get silenced by a stern look from Pillar.\n\nUnfazed, Zillquat beckoned to the twin-engine bomber occupying most of the hangar. "I mean, look at this! I thought we’d all agreed that the Legation Air Force needed light aircrafts. Light, as in ‘not too expensive, with a modest profile and easy to maintain’, which Colthage could have easily provided at a reasonable price, by the way." He scowled. "And yet what we have here? Something that’s twice as big, probably consumes twice as much fuel too, and for what? So that some Wingbardian company can get a contract?"\n\nEventually, he finally realized the look every creature was giving him. "Well, what’s the matter? Did I say something wrong? It’s true though! He’s got a bigger-"\n\n"Zillquat!" Marble Pillar snapped, eyes narrowing to slits. "Shut up. Now." It was too late though, as Sonar Beep had already broken down into an uncontrollable fit of giggles. Meanwhile, if the grin slitting his beak was any indication, Gevese was clearly having way too much fun.\n\nSomewhere behind, one of the Wingbardian bomber pilots took the chance to slip by his Colthaginian colleague -a stallion of course- and quietly deliver the kind of predictable pun one could have seen coming from miles away. Unsurprisingly, he would not find that very amusing."

legation.10.t:0 "The Sit Down"
legation.10.d:0 "If the many years as a military griffon -and a diplomat too, even if a bit later- had taught Gappi anything, was that you should always get the measurement of the creatures you’re supposed to work with. Preferably as soon as possible. The results so far, however, were mixed.\n\n"Stop treating this like it’s your personal backyard!" Ocean Spray hissed from across the table. "We are now in hostile territory, and we must treat it as such! Do you truly think that Aris won’t try and take back Winggarden if they get the chance? A fight is coming, and we must be ready!"\n\nFrom the other side of the table, Azizelqart raised an eyebrow, clearly unimpressed. "The memo hasn’t reached you yet, Legate? The war is over. What you are proposing right now is the equivalent of reigniting hostilities, and may I remind you that attracting capital is particularly difficult if the city becomes a warzone. We can gain much more through free trade than violence."\n\n"Capital? Trade?" The Chiropterran Legate rose from his seat, fangs bared, his face vivid with fury. "Are you insane?!"\n\n"Alright, gentlegriff. I think this is quite enough. Constant discussion is clearly bringing us nowhere." Gappi quickly cut in the argument. He took a sip from his cup, savouring it. Equestrian tea was truly something special.\n\n"The problem I see right now," Gappi began, "is that each one of us has a different vision for Winggarden. In doing so however, we have forgotten one common element we all share; for all of us, you see, the Legation is but the steppingstone to something greater back to our respective homes."\n\n"I will not ask you why you’re here. Your reasons are your own, but please keep this in mind; the chance that has been granted us is unprecedented. Winggarden is a blank sheet, ready to be filled as we see fit. Now, we can squander this opportunity by constant arguing and backstabbing, or we can collaborate for the time being, so that the wealth gathered here will be the foundation of our respective careers."\n\nGappi lifted his teacup high as if for a toast, grinning to each in turn. "So, what do you believe is the best outcome?""

legation.11.d:0 "No creature knew who had called it into the effect. If they had any suspicion, none of the three Legates said a word, and simply decided to go along as if it was perfectly normal. Except, of course, there was nothing normal about Article 43b. It was supposed to be an extrema ratio to be used, amongst other things, in case of insurrection or foreign meddling inside the Legation. Whatever plan any of the three had, all the careful work and manoeuvre done to gain an advantage over the others, it was thrown into complete jeopardy for the following months.\n\nAfter a brief -and quite heated- evening meeting, each Legate went back to their respective office to deal with new development in a different way.\n\nOcean Spray summoned Marble Pillar, Sonar Beep, and the rest of the Chiropterran officials, and then proceeded to scream at them for fifteen minutes; Azizelqart withdrew to his quarters in silence and buried himself in work until well after midnight; Gappi would attempt to enjoy a fine bottle of expensive red wine, only to barely drink half of it. Said bottle ended up smashed on the wall, thrown into a fit of rage uncharacteristic of the otherwise calm griffon.\n\nNone of them had any illusion on what was to come. If 43b had been called into action, it meant that the gloves were off now. The struggle for the control of Winggarden city would only become fiercer in the coming days. But that was in the future.\n\nFor now they rested, and drew up new plans."

legation.12.d:0 ""I must admit, Azizelqart, I wasn’t expecting you to be so ... bloodthirsty," Gappi noted.\n\nThe Colthaginian Legate looked up from his notes, giving him a sceptical glance. "I would hardly call myself that. I’m simply assuring a bright future for Winggarden, for both ourselves and our benefactors."\n\n"And does that include bashing the Hippogriffs even more than we’ve already done?"\n\nAzizelqart shrugged. "That is such a hostile way of putting it. We’re merely abiding by the Twelve Concessions, precisely as they were written. Besides, I thought you said that the Legation City must be open to business. Well, there you are. Soon, riches will pour into the city coffins. And if the Hippogriffs do disagree, then they’re free to write a formal protest."\n\n"For some reason, I’m not so certain they’ll limit to that," Gappi pointed out.\n\n"So what if they don’t?" The sudden outburst came from Ocean Spray, rising from his seat to loom over the table. "Our security forces have been preparing for this moment. Winggarden’s defensive network is now a mighty bulwark, and we’ll use it to drown the Hippogriffs in a sea of blood! Let Aris come, for the forces of the Nightmare stand ready!"\n\nAzizelqart shot him a perplexed look at first, but then he nodded, although tentatively. "Ah ...yes, something like that. Though I doubt Aris is in any shape for an armed struggle; so, we can use these fortunate circumstances to apply more leverage and ... Gappi, why are you grinning?"\n\nThe griffon shook his head. "Oh please, don’t mind me. Go ahead. I’m just so proud of you two finally agreeing on something." Gappi mimicked wiping away a tear from his eyes. "Quite touching I must say."\n\nA look of horrified realization appeared on both Azizelqart and Ocean’s faces. They exchanged a glance to one another, a disgusted one at that."

legation.13.d:0 "Wind Flow placed a hoof over the book held before her by an elderly-looking constable. "I do solemnly swear allegiance to the Legation City of Winggarden, to uphold its laws and maintain order within its boundaries."\n\nThe older hippogriff shrugged. "Good enough. Go into the next room and another officer will issue you your uniform and the initial gear. We’ll have a briefing in one hour where you’ll get your first assignment. Next!"\n\nWind nodded, stone-faced. She struggled to keep the disgust on her face from showing as she stepped out of the line of soon-to-be constables, just as another hippogriff stepped forward to take the oath, similarly to her.\n\nA newly-ironed uniform was pushed into her arms by a bored-looking bat, together with a belt and a short baton. No firearm though. Her blood boiled once her gaze fell upon the badge standing out on top of the bundle.\n\nWind Flow had never considered herself much of a patriot or a nationalist, and yet joining up the Volunteer Department -effectively helping the occupiers- left a bitter taste in her mouth.\n\nStill, what other choice did she seriously have? Commerce with the rest of Aris had effectively ceased once the Legation City had been established. And as cheaper goods begun to come in, her small shop had quickly gone under. Nearly forty years of family tradition weren’t worth much, not anymore at least.\n\nAt least the wage was good though; at least now she didn’t have to worry about what to put on the dinner table for her kids."

If you didn't trust them, you still had to carry out their orders, and the best thing an officer could do was to believe, and to trust.\n\nCaptain Galbo reminded himself of this again and again as the furious banging on the walls of his submarine began once more. Twelve years in the Wingbardian navy, several commendations and a chance to serve abroad in Zebrica, and yet this was where he had ended up?\n\n"Deploy the divers," he ordered quietly, and one of his officers moved as fast as she could over the by now padded floors and towards the diving lock, where she silently gave a signal to the six officers who had spent eight hours inside their wetsuits, waiting for this moment. Closing the hatch, they silently filled it with water from the ballast tanks so that it would not be noticed from the outside, and the officers all quietly put the masks over their faces, using the new Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatuses to be able to breathe even as the lock filled with water.\n\nWhen the airlock finally opened, his divers shot out of it as fast as their artificial fins could propel them, out at the seaponies that had clustered around the submarine to vandalize it, as they did every time. Not this time though, with their new gear, his officers would be almost as fast as the seaponies.\n\nOr they would be, if the seaponies had not come prepared with nets, and all his officers had for their rapid deployment was swimming straight into the nets like panicked fishes. With the seaponies descending on them, tearing off their fins and covering them in sea life, all Captain Galbo was left with was four humiliated officers coming back through the diving lock covered in starfishes and clams just as the knocking began again."

legation.15.d:0 "The public opening ceremony was a rather quick and modest affair, and that suited Azizelqart just fine. Operating behind the scenes and away from the public’s eye was something he had long since grown accustomed to back in Colthage; that’s where the real work was done, after all.\n\nConvincing the other two legates to support the complete renewal of the extensive Winggarden tram system had proven to be considerably easier than expected. Gappi had been enthusiastic about it, of course, and had immediately gone ahead to contact specialized engineers from Wingbardy to put to work on the project. Ocean Spray had, on the other hoof, grumbled for a bit, wondering why all that money wasn’t being used to strengthen the city defences, but had eventually come around after some heated discussion. He did however request for a couple of those rail lines to be reserved to military use only. Azizelqart didn’t know why he needed them and hardly cared, so long as he had the thestral’s approval.\n\nAnd so the project went ahead, with universal support no less. As for Azizelqart, he got exactly what he wanted. Such great work would not only prove an immediate benefit in drawing companies to Winggarden, but also act as a great showcase to the rest of the world. The Legation City was putting the scars of the war behind and finally opening back to business.\n\nOh, and Winggarden’s citizens could get a modern, functioning tram system for moving around; that one too."

Therefore, the zebra legate took care to visit the city’s docks and greet personally the incoming executives from his homeland. All in all, it was quite the friendly affair; Zahummid smiled, shook a couple of hooves, even cracked a joke or two.\n\nAfter that, he had them escorted to an already booked, five-stars hotel and parked for a couple of days there, so that they could enjoy the city and doing a bit of sightseeing. Or rather, Zahummid made sure to instruct the security detachment to steer his compatriots towards what he wanted them to see.\n\nThey would eat in the best restaurants, go shopping in the fanciest boutiques, and enjoy the kind of night-time entertainment that only a city as Winggarden could offer. Some would call it coaching; Zahummid preferred the term "readying the terrain".\n\nTo the surprise of nopony, the following meeting went exceedingly well; saying that the executives were enthusiastic about his proposition would have been a massive understatement. The Colthaginian consortiums would find a city welcoming them with open hooves. And the Legate would gain a great asset in the form of a considerable chunk of the local industry placed under Colthage’s control."

I guessed it from the colours, mostly."\n\nGappi smiled politely, then nodded. "Why, yes. You have quite the eye, I must admit. It is in fact from Saddle Arabia. A little treat I gave myself before the place decided to implode. I wasn’t aware you had such knowledge on art history."\n\n"A griffon ought to have a hobby or two," Gattei replied with a shrug. He chuckled. "Believe it or not, I dreamed of being an artist when I was younger. Took a few drawing lessons too back in Karthin. Instead, I found myself becoming "Beakolini’s oil guy", as some within the party are fond of calling me." He shook his head.\n\n"I’ll try and be honest with you, Legate Gappi," Gattei began, and the other griffon’s ears immediately perked up in interest. Up to that point they had been chatting amicably in his office, almost like two old friends, but that was over now. If Gattei was now addressing him by his title, it meant it was finally time to conduct business.\n\n"The AGWP has been finding itself in a bit of a pickle as of late. You see, the official party line is that Abyssinia has been utterly pacified. Unfortunately, this has proven again and again not to be the case. The government won’t send more troops there, for it would mean admitting that the Duce was wrong. On the other claw though, investors get understandably more and more agitated when they hear AGWP refineries have gotten repeatedly firebombed by enraged natives."\n\nGappi nodded solemnly, eyebrows furrowed. "That does sound quite bothersome."\n\n"Oh it is, I assure you. Sadly, the Duce seems to care little as long as the oil and gas keeps flowing, which might not be all that long. And when that happens, well, it will be my head on the chopping block."\n\n"I see. Well, what kind of proud patriot would I be if I were to leave a fellow countrygriff without help?"\n\nGattei let out a small chuckle. "Wingbardy is truly lucky of having you here, Legate Gappi. I suppose you already have a few ideas on how to help me that you’d like to discuss."\n\nA wide smile made its appearance of Gappi’s face.

And yet there he was, his mouth twitching into something that, after some squinting, could be called a smile. Or something similar, anyway.\n\nThe civil engineer by his side, a zebra mare, was still talking, occasionally pointing and waving her hoof around so to illustrate where the current project would take place. Ocean Spray had stopped listening to her a few minutes ago, thanks in no small part to the ruckus of labouring crews and roar of construction engines. Still, he made the effort to look interested and nod once in a while, but his mind was elsewhere.\n\nGappi and Azizelqart were both fools, he had long since decided. They were so busy running Winggarden like their personal project that they had forgotten the Hippogriff threat still out there. The military towns being built weren’t just a petty attempt to seize the best city quarters for his own, but they would act as mighty bulwarks against the incoming tide.\n\nNarrow streets that could function as chokepoints; reinforced concrete walls; flat rooftops sturdy enough to support the weight of heavier weapons. And of course, dedicated shrines for the Nightmare.\n\nThe military towns weren’t just a home away from home for the Chiropterrans, but veritable fortresses, a coiled trap ready to spring into action and bleed the invaders, or insurgents, dry.\n\nBesides, they were a fond reminder for Ocean Spray of where he had grown up.

Over the course of several weeks, the Legate’s cabinet would grow exponentially with new arrivals, something that did not escape his colleagues’ notice. Still, none of them did more than raising an eyebrow.\n\nGappi was too busy refining what he still considered "his" project, while Ocean Spray was ... well, he wasn’t really sure what the thestral was doing. Still, that was fine by him.\n\nAnd as Zahummid look across from his desk at the young and sharp minds gathered before him, he couldn’t help but smile proudly. They were all there because he had invited them. He hadn’t coaxed them with money or, at the very least, not just money. No, he was selling much more than.\n\nHe was proposing to them an environment fully under their control, where their counsel and economic expertise would unshackle Winggarden’s full economic potential and propelled it to heights never seen before. All without pesky bureaucracy or boring politics getting in the way.\n\nHe had sold them an idea, and in exchange they would help him making it a reality."

Winggarden has had no shortage of ambitious and dedicated creatures to fill the ranks beneath the legates, yet when the ones meant to be their superiors kept squabbling instead of governing, it wasn't long before people began to whisper. Calling it a conspiracy might be far-fetched, it was more like a series of changes throughout each of their organizations. Officials were no longer personally loyal to the legates, but instead their respective departments, and the big three's bickering became more and more of a hassle that needed to be dealt with. Thus, bit by bit, the great game found itself grinding to a halt, and by the time the legates realized what had happened it was too late.\n\nThere was no insurrection and no drama, just a sudden realization for all of them that their respective offices no longer supported them. And what were they meant to do? Call their respective homelands and say that theír subordinates weren't being obedient? At best, they'd get laughed at, at worst they'd cause an international incident as any foreign meddling would lead to the other parties intervening.\n\nThus, only a slow surrender was left for them, and they all handled it differently. Gappi slowly resigned himself to his fate and took a week off work. Ocean Spray barricaded himself in his office and and screamed through the window that they would all pay for this for several hours, until a squad of soldiers kicked the door down and forcibly escorted him home to cool off. In contrast though, Zahummid has not only taken the news well but seemed outright overjoyed, at least if his enthusiastic treating of the office to his personal liquor and cigarres was any indication.\n\nWith the legates either sidelined or persuaded, a new dawn is rising for Winggarden, a Winggarden that has managed to rise to stand on her own four legs!"

"It's Golden Shore, isn't it?" he added as he was done, Gappi nodding.\n\n"It is, so thank Boreas for small blessings, at least."\n\n"What blessing is there even to be had here?!" Ocean Spray suddenly snapped, Azizelqart thinking to himself that the name was really fitting, considering how much the Chiropterran spat when he screamed. "Are you both utterly insane?! Why are we even entertaining this?! We should each be requesting aid from our homelands to crush this whole insurrection! But no, suddenly we are capitulating to the natives?!"\n\n"And I thought a military pony like you would understand the necessity of reform," Azizelqart commented airily. "Our purpose is to make sure money flows from Winggarden. If political liberalization helps in that, then why not?"\n\n"If giving control to the creatures we conquered helps us maintain it?" Ocean Spray asked. "Are you insane! Do you seriously think making a hippogriff a legate will aid in anything?"\n\n"We're not making one a legate, we're making one a president." Azizelqart replied mildly, watching as Ocean Spray seemed to swallow his tongue in disbelief."
legation.21.a:0 "It is a necessary shakeup."

legation.22.t:0 "A New Winggardian Democracy"
legation.22.d:0 ""And as we move forward towards a brighter future, I want to ask you all, my fellow citizens, what future this should be?!" Golden Shore asked as he stood before the crowd. "This beautiful city would never have risen this far without us, my fellow Hippogriffs. Our dilligence and our hard work is the bedrock of Winggarden, and we are building towards a future where every hippogriff will be the queen or king of this city, free and more prosperous than we ever could have imagined! I believe in a united and prosperous Winggarden: will you all continue to build with me?!" he asked, the crowd cheering enthusiastically.\n\nComing off the stage, he smiled widely as he shook claws with the people he just had addressed, listening idly to their concerns and giving them comforting little words. As he spotted the journalists with their cameras, he leaned in to one of the females that had come up to him, poking the little chick she was carrying with her in the stomach.\n\n"Well aren't you the cutest little thing?" he said merrily, "What can such a fine little boy be called, then?"\n\nAs the mother told him the name he made an affirmative noise and made sure the cameras caught him playing with the fuzzy little thing. "A fine name indeed. I hope we'll both be able to continue working for his future as well!" He said, drawing enthusiastic cheers from the hippogriffs around him. Still, he made sure to keep some distance from the fuzzball in case it decided to puke or something."
legation.22.a:0 "The plan progresses well."

legation.23.t:0 "A New Dawn"
legation.23.d:0 "Golden Shore smiled widely as he shook the legates' hooves - claw in Gilippo's case - and made sure to let the cameras capture him from his best side. It had been a stunning victory for him - of course it had - and he waved to the crowds gathered in front of the legates' office - now the presidential residence - to watch his inauguration. With one claw raised, he put his hand on the law book and solemnly swore the presidential oath. He couldn't quite stop smiling, especially not as the sash was placed across his chest, and as he greeted the crowd, the smile was near blinding.\n\n"Today is a new day for Winggarden!" he said loudly, "My fellow Winggardians, how proud can we not all be this day?! Today, we have taken a great step towards making Winggarden, and Winggarden only, the shining city on the hill that we all know that she can be!"\n\nAs he spoke, Azizelqart sat in the background, smiling politely as he envisioned the string-pull on Golden Shore's back. Mentally, he reached out and imagined pulling it, and he had to stop his grin as Golden Shore's topic switched as if on a cue.\n\n"And I tell you all, my fellow Winggardians, that we are not done yet, and that we must continue to fight to ensure that the brave new world that has arisen in this city can remain an inspiration to all! Whatever was, we are Winggardians now, no less and no more, for what more could any creature ask for, than to be part of this great project? I swear to you, my fellow citizens, that I will not let Winggarden be threatened by anyone! Together, we will prevail, we will remain prosperous, and we will remain the envy of the world!"\n\nAzizelqart nodded to himself. Golden Shore really had been a good investment."    
legation.23.a:0 "Hurray for Democracy."

legation.24.t:0 "The Proposal"
legation.24.d:0 "After we lost Winggarden the city transformed immensely, becoming a hub of economic exploitation for our enemies. While we have worked to recover, they have grown fat from the wealth that flows from the city. With this in mind, recent events are shocking to say the least. The city has elected its own leader and has moved to distance itself from its old. The new "president" of Winggarden, a hippogriff named Golden Shore, has contacted us with an offer of rapprochement.\n\nThe offer would let us access the Winggardian markets and enjoy the wealth that had built up there - something we sorely lack after recent events, yet in doing so we would not only give up our claim on the city, but we would also need to surrender the surrounding countryside to it. The area in question would serve as in part a buffer zone, but also to ensure Winggarden, and thus the wealth it would provide us, can continue to grow.\n\nThe city is still under Chiropterran, Wingbardian and Colthaginian control, and our prospects of retaking it by force is slim to say the least. This, at least, would give us something for all the pain, but can we truly give up the city?"
legation.24.a:0 "I suppose it is acceptable."
legation.24.b:0 "Not a damn chance! Winggarden is Hippogriffia!"

legation.25.t:0 "The Winggarden Concordant"
legation.25.d:0 "Rising up out of his seat, Golden Shore pushed the button on his desk and called for his secretary to bring in his champagne before he walked around the desk and gave the ambassador a hearty hug.\n\n"A fantastic choice, my friend!" he said as he wrapped one arm over the ambassador's shoulders and walked towards the window with him. "You will not regret this, I can assure you of that! Hippogriffia is stepping into the future, to become one more claw holding the ladle that stirs the great melting pot!"\n\n"Yes, it will be reassuring for everyone that we are finally normalizing relations," the Ambassador said evenly, seeming more than a little uncomfortable. "We all hope that this will help us build towards a better future..."\n\n"Oh it will, it most certainly will!" Golden Shore exclaimed with a wide, slick smile. "And if nothing else..." he said, leaning in a bit conspiratorially. "You can not imagine how much this will enrage a certain Chiropterran legate," he whispered, clucking happily as he patted the hippogriff on the shoulder."  
legation.25.a:0 "Our freedom is secured!"

legation.26.t:0 "The Concordant Rejected"
legation.26.d:0 ""Well that certainly wasn't a good showing for the new president," Gilippo commented as he leaned back on the chair and read the newspaper, the front page of which was plastered with the news that Hippogriffia had refused the offer of rapprochement.\n\n"Thank the moon for small mercies, at least," Ocean Spray commented with a scoff. "Also, why are you two pestering me at breakfast of all times?"\n\n"Because you have a nice taste in cafés if nothing else," Azizelqart responded from across the table before taking a bite out of the daisy sandwich. He really hadn't known what to think of this Equestrian-style sandwich at first, but he had decided he liked it. "But as much of a shame as it is, it won't matter too much in the long run. Hippogriffia decided to place national pride before cutting their losses and improving their economy. That is their loss."\n\n"At least Golden Shore made the effort," Gilippo commented, "and the locals will remember that. They really do have good food here though," he admitted to Ocean Spray. Instead of responding, Ocean Spray silently downed his coffee, fantasizing about pouring it over them."

But the point for him was it's pushing three hours past noon, and he had an afternoon of drinking with his merc friends to get to. Finally, the door to the safe house opened, and the kirin stepped in. "Soothing Song, premier biologist of the University of Gamia, I can not believe we are meeting yet again, here in my city, and... and... why are you covered in blood?"\n\nLooking at the Kirin yet again, Coffee saw the faint red stain on the kirin's brown waistcoat and drew back. Blood never interested him, it could get in his fur, and that was a messy cleanup. It was the worst bodily fluid to try and bleach out.\n\n"Ah ah yes, Mr. Bean, Soothing Song simply had a bit of a run-in with a paid head collector on my way here." Coffee Bean groaned; he remembered how much the kirin's self-referential speech annoyed him. Then, something set in. "Wait, paid head collector... bounty hunters are looking for you? And you came to my safehouse?!" Coffee Bean grunted loudly and began shutting all the windows in the house, why did this need to happen to him? He specifically went to this meeting unarmed to try to court the kirin, and now he brought a serious threat of danger. Soothing Song spoke calmly, "No no Mr. Bean! Soothing Song dispatched them both already. It only took a pistol and some Plasmid powers."\n\nCoffee Bean settled down at this, and took his seat at the table in the center of the room, inviting Soothing Song to do the same. "Alright, alright that's good doctor. So you're still working on those plas-mid things? I remember that paper you showed me all those years ago, clever idea to use poison joke in that way." Soothing Song sat and nodded, "Yes Mr. Bean. But work has been slow for Soothing Song. The governments of the world are afraid of this research, what it could do to their societies. They ban Soothing Song from getting research money, and expel me. Thought Kiria would be better, Soothing Song was excited when the silence was lifted, thought research would be freed. Turned out to be more of the same."\n\nCoffee Bean nodded, "So, about these Plasmids. I'll give you all the cash you could ever need, but I'd like a demonstration if possible. To see how the magic happens." Coffee Bean looked down at a drawer in the table, "Let me just get you proof I'm not cheating you... hold on..." Coffee Bean looked back up to see the seat in front of him empty, looking around he couldn't see the kirin anywhere. Then, he heard a voice from behind him.\n\n"Tell me Mr. Bean. Have you ever wanted to be magical?" Coffee Bean, upon hearing this, took a small bag full of white powder out of his pocket, and inhaled it. Shaking the residue off his snout, he whispered back to the voice, "Buck yeah.""

Once the dust had settled and the remnant forces had finally surrendered, some aides had burst into his office to bring the news. The security forces met him at the exit, and escorted him to a hurriedly makeshift podium to make the proclamation he'd drawn up on a napkin just moments prior. \n "Good citizens." He began, peering between the haze to try and read the smudged doodles on the now damp piece of paper. "The war's over. My guys tell me that we've got complete control over every major throughfare and like, yeah. It's all good." Staring over at the assembled crowd, he took a moment. This was one of those grand moments, something that would go down in history. He had to make a point. Besides, a groundbreaking speech would surely boost stock values, on top of today's breakthrough.\n"Today, we've shown that the market decides who wants what, and what it wants right now is to be free, as we all do. Freedom for all, equality for all and at market dictated price. Is there anything more pure, more wholesome in the world? I don't think so, mares and colts, I don't think so." Yeah, his 'pick-me-up' was starting to hit. "So with this stunning display, I bring you a declaration. Today, right here, right now, I hereby declare this land to be Libertalia, the freest place in the whole world. The place where anyone can get anything, where I guarantee you there'll be no meddling or state interference. We've shown here and now just what the determined can do, and we've got more to come. Join me, folks, and cheer for Libertalia." \n Today, he'd celebrate along with the other citizens. Maybe tomorrow, too. After that, he'd see what needed doing.

Either way, she was out of prison, and her mind raced with thoughts of tracking down her old friends, figuring out who was alive, who was imprisoned, who had escaped, and who had died.\n\nFor now, she wandered aimlessly around Starfield, trying to shut her ears to the endless cacophony of their new music. Throughout her stay in prison, the fascists had experimented their dissonant creations on her and the other inmates. Initially she thought it was an exotic form of torture, but they actually liked it! All the shapes, the sounds, the colours of the new Aris were sharp, excessive, violent, migraine-inducing. Maybe it was different in Seaquestria, or out in the country?\n\nStopping to sit down on a park bench, Posada noticed a pair of Blackwings had been following her. Ah. This is why they let her out: to have her assassinated like Gatteotti. Posada resolved not to give them the satisfaction of coming quietly. As they got closer she noticed something odd about their uniforms: it wasn't the traditional vests of Aris First, nor the militaristic garb of Beakolini's goons. No, this was...\n\n"Posada!" one of the blackwings called jovially, his eyes obscured by dark sunglasses, "I'd heard you just got out of jail!

### Legation Advisors ###
WIN_advisor_1:0 "Gilippo Gappi"
WIN_advisor_1_desc:0 "If there is one creature within Winggarden that could be said to embody what the Legation means for the nations involved, it would be Gilippo Gappi. Once just a minor diplomat in Wingbardy's foreign service, Gappi played an immense role in getting the griffons to seize the chance offered by the Colthaginian and Chiropterran invasion of the Hippogriffs' continental mandate, seeing tremendous economic opportunity in the venture. He had known these lands for years before entering the diplomatic service, serving in the seas around Zebrica as a member of the Wingbardian Navy and Air Force, where he pioneered airship technology and added much of Zebrica to Wingbardian maps. So when Wingbardy needed a diplomat to head their new involvements in Zebrica, Gilippo's application was readily accepted, and he was sent once again to Zebrica to work out treaties with Wingbardy's new allies on the continent. Gilippo was also the griffon who sat at the negotiating table with the Hippogriffs and placed before them the now-infamous Twelve Concessions. With the Legation being a concession of his own inception. An international zone jointly ruled by the three nations.\n\nBut this is where Gappi faltered. He believed that the legation would be able to exist in perpetual peace. But now, with the reality of the Legation's situation clear to him, he has joined in its great game to ensure the interests of his nation come out on top.\n\n§rViva il Re e viva alla nazione!§!\n\n"
WIN_advisor_2:0 "Ocean Spray"
WIN_advisor_2_desc:0 "Ocean Spray was born to a couple of Silver Moon Legion Soldiers forty-four years ago, entering the service as quickly as he could, he slowly began to climb the Legion's ranks, but not in the way most did. He was not a military bat, but a pencil-pushing bureaucrat, though one adept at his job. In his early thirties, he signed up for the LMRD, serving to organize and structure their less savory business into a form more palatable by the rest of the Legions. This work gained him the attention of Emerald Light, who marked the Bat down for a higher position at a later time. That time came at Chiropterra's triumph over the Hippogriffs, when it and its allies established Winggarden. While the Council of Legions was looking for a bat to send, Emerald put Ocean Spray forth. He was competent, pious, and seemed like a good choice. But he was also personally loyal to his Silver Moon legion, a detail Commander Light was sure to leave out.\n\nPersonally, Spray is no kind soul. He is a harsh bat, and is only a bit nicer to his friends than enemies and only has a few hobbies. He holds a general disdain for the hippogriff and seapony populations, and is always preparing for a struggle against them. He often chides against his fellow representatives, continually wishing to assure his control over the Legation military, sometimes even against the other Chiropterran commanders' advice. Many question why someone as un-charasmatic as him was placed as the Chiropterran representative.\n\nSecretly though, this is all part of Chiropterra's place in the great game of Winggarden. Once a month Ocean Spray receives two letters. One from the Legionary Council and Warmaster of Chiropterra, his "official" orders, and another delievered to him secretly, Operation Nightlight, Winggarden's place in Lunar dominance of Zebrica, and then, further beyond.\n\n§CHe serves Her Imperial Majesty, Nightmare Moon, and the Silver Legion above all other things, and he will not betray his duty.§!\n\n"
WIN_advisor_3:0 "Azizelqart Zahummid"
WIN_advisor_3_desc:0 "Azizelqart Zahummid is a name most in Colthage will know, but they can't tell you much about him. His whole life, he has been an economist working in the back rooms of Colthaginian government to guide its ship of state. A member of Zamilcar Zarca's favored Scientific Clique, he fled with Zalathel when the Storm King arrived and served in his cabinet when he reestablished his rule over Colthage, earning him a high place in the economics ministry. In this regard, many would be content to stop there, sit on their rear end, and make a happy and healthy living. And Azizelqart was content for a long time, until he read Gappi's documents regarding the opportunities in establishing the Legation. It made something burn deep within him, an opportunity to try his economic theories in a land where he had near-total control of the economic sphere. So, he drafted his proposal to Zalathel and submitted it, requesting the spot as Colthage's representative in the Legation, and promising great things should his efforts be supported. And so he was sent to Winggarden with a blank cheque. To do as he sees fit, and to bring prosperity to Colthage.\n\n§gFor the good of all its citizens.§!\n\n"

### Leader Descriptions ### 
WIN_GILIPO_GAPPI_DESC:0 "If there is one creature within Winggarden that could be said to embody what the Legation means for the nations involved, it would be Gilippo Gappi. But now that mission has failed, and he sits atop a shadow of what Winggarden once was. Once just a minor diplomat in Wingbardy's foreign service, Gappi played an immense role in getting the griffons to seize the chance offered by the Colthaginian and Chiropterran invasion of the Hippogriffs' continental mandate, seeing tremendous economic opportunity in the venture. He had known these lands for years before entering the diplomatic service, serving in the seas around Zebrica as a member of the Wingbardian Navy and Air Force, where he pioneered airship technology and added much of Zebrica to Wingbardian maps. So when Wingbardy needed a diplomat to head their new involvements in Zebrica, Gilippo's application was readily accepted, and he was sent once again to Zebrica to work out treaties with Wingbardy's new allies on the continent. Gilippo was also the griffon who sat at the negotiating table with the Hippogriffs and placed before them the now-infamous Twelve Concessions. With the Legation being a concession of his own inception, he now sees that vision has failed.\n\nSo now he has a new job, find a Hippogriff who can adopt his Leader's ideology. And pray to the Trinity that it will keep the city stable."
WIN_OCEAN_SPRAY_DESC:0 "Ocean Spray was born to a couple of Silver Moon Legion Soldiers forty-four years ago, entering the service as quickly as he could, he slowly began to climb the Legion's ranks, but not in the way most did. He was not a military bat, but a pencil-pushing bureaucrat, though one adept at his job. In his early thirties, he signed up for the LMRD, serving to organize and structure their less savory business into a form more palatable by the rest of the Legions, eventually rising to be the Chiropterran Legate in Winggarden. But recently, things have changed.\n\nPersonally, Spray is no kind soul. He is a harsh bat, and is only a bit nicer to his friends than enemies and only has a few hobbies. He holds a general disdain for the hippogriff and seapony populations, and is always preparing for a struggle against them.\n\nBut now he has hit a new height. The Warmaster now sends him new orders. No longer is the plan to be careful subversion and maintaining control, now it shall only be absolute domination. Ocean Spray has seized his chance and has upended Chiropterran policy in Hippogriffia. He intends to use his position for the good of the nation and aim a "Dagger at Mount Aris" as he regularly says to his assistants.\n\nOcean Spray is in control of Winggarden now. And Nightmare help any creature who stands in his way."
WIN_AZIZELQUART_ZAHUMIND_DESC:0 "Azizelqart Zahummid is a name most in Colthage will know, but they can't tell you much about him. His whole life, he has been an economist working in the back rooms of Colthaginian government to guide its ship of state, and now the guardian of a new nation, the Colthago Nuovo Project. A member of Zamilcar Zarca's favored Scientific Clique, he fled with Zalathel when the Storm King arrived and served in his cabinet when he reestablished his rule over Colthage, earning him a high place in the economics ministry. In this regard, many would be content to stop there, sit on their rear end, and make a happy and healthy living. And Azizelqart was content for a long time, until he read Gappi's documents regarding the opportunities in establishing the Legation. It made something burn deep within him, an opportunity to try his economic theories in a land where he had near-total control of the economic sphere. He just never expected to be leading it. After the fall of the Legation, Zahummid has done his best to save many aspects of the previous system. And with this, he has had even more freedom to implement his economic ideas. He has declared that his Colthago Nuovo will be a bastion of free market economics, proving that a nation can run itself off of the power of capital alone. But only time will show if he can succeed."

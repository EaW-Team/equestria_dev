### Ideas ###
MNC_banditry:0 "Graveyard Of Empires"
MNC_banditry_desc:0 "The Whitetail mountain chain presents an insurmountable obstacle to any would-be invader, not just because of logistical concerns. The mountain clans that call Brantbeak home are fiercely independent, accept no ruler other than one of their own, and know their way around the treacherous passes better than any other griff. Any attempt to conquer this land would inevitably get bogged down in fierce partisan raids."
MNC_eriviars_obsession:0 "Eriviar's Obsession"
MNC_eriviars_obsession_desc:0 "Eriviar Sunstriker rose to lead the mountain clans based on capability and personal might, and as such, his rule was absolute and respected. Recently, however, he has gained an obsession for the legendary complex known as "Blackstone Fortress" and its supposed vast wealth. His subordinates are questioning the value of pursuing what might be an empty fable, instead of chasing after reliable plunder."
MNC_eriviars_obsession_2:0 "Eriviar's Obsession"
MNC_eriviars_obsession_2_desc:0 "Eriviar Sunstriker rose to lead the mountain clans based on capability and personal might, and as such, his rule was absolute and respected. Recently, however, he has gained an obsession for the legendary complex known as "Blackstone Fortress" and its supposed vast wealth. His subordinates are questioning the value of pursuing what might be an empty fable, instead of chasing after reliable plunder.\n\nEriviar has overruled all of his detractors and set forth to find Blackstone. Whether will this be his greatest triumph or folly remains to be seen."
MNC_the_loot:0 "The Riches Of Blackstone"
MNC_the_loot_desc:0 "In spite of every naysayer and protester, Eriviar has accomplished the unimaginable and returned to Brantbeak, his coffers swelling with the untold amount of precious metals, rare gemstones and ancient artifacts taken from the Blackstone complex. Even his most bitter rivals cannot deny that the estimated value of the loot greatly outnumbers the cost Eriviar placed into his obsession. The mountain clans are wealthy and prosperous, for now."
MNC_total_chaos:0 "Whitetail In Chaos"
MNC_total_chaos_desc:0 "With Eriviar slain chasing his obsession, the realm of Brantbeak has descended into near-anarchy as griffons fight amongst themselves for control of the nation. Eriviar's relatives are nowhere as commanding and charismatic as he was, and they cannot count on anygriff's support for rulership. These are hard times for Whitetail."

### Focuses ###
MNC_preparing_the_raid:0 "The Path To The Blackstone Fortress"
MNC_preparing_the_raid_desc:0 "[MNC.GetLeader] is a greedy griffon, certainly, but he wouldn't go after Blackstone if he wasn't certain that there might be something worth stealing. After extensive research, Eriviar will present to his followers how he intends to find and plunder Blackstone, supposedly nested high in the most inhospitable reaches of Dimpeak."
MNC_acquire_supplies:0 "The Provisions"
MNC_acquire_supplies_desc:0 "To reach the far north of the realm, Dimpeak, Eriviar needs to muster every ounce of supplies he can find. From simple necessities such as food, water and warm clothing, to rifles, beasts of burden (to carry all the loot) and more. Considerable investment will be required to fund all of these purchases, but Eriviar has plenty of Idols remaining. For now."
MNC_protective_equipment:0 "Protection Of Every Sort"
MNC_protective_equipment_desc:0 "There is no telling what Eriviar might encounter, should he locate the Blackstone complex. Eriviar has always been the cunning griff, and he believes in the value of preparation. The expedition will be successful as long as everygriff is properly equipped to handle the dangers of a hostile area."
MNC_mobile_equipment:0 "Armoured Snowmobiles And Pack Animals"
MNC_mobile_equipment_desc:0 "The roads to the far north can be best described as non-existent, but Eriviar does not believe that one should simply walk to Blackstone. After all, the griffs would be dead tired long before from all the gear they're carrying! A sufficient amount of vehicles and pack animals needs to be procured for a safe travel."
MNC_finest_rifles:0 "A Necessity In Force"
MNC_finest_rifles_desc:0 "Eriviar has always held the opinion that you shouldn't steal anything if you're not prepared to defend it with force, lethal force that is. Accounts vary on what inhabitants occupy Blackstone, from a wayward griffon clan consumed by greed, to demons of Tartarus drawn by magical power. Nonetheless, whoever lies in wait will not give up their treasures freely."
MNC_scrounge_up_extra_loot:0 "Scrounge Up Additional Funds"
MNC_scrounge_up_extra_loot_desc:0 "Although Eriviar commands obedience and respect from the mountain clans, many of them have been critical towards of the idea of finding Blackstone. Convinced that their leader is chasing a myth, they refuse to provide funding and resources for the expedition. On the other claw, Eriviar has his methods of ensuring his will is carried out. So what if a few beaks end up broken?"
MNC_go_to_the_library:0 "Examine The Brantbeak Chronicles"
MNC_go_to_the_library_desc:0 "Many dismiss Blackstone as a fable, or a city that has been long abandoned and plundered, but the local records do mention a settlement near the area Eriviar claims to be Blackstone in his maps. Keen to provide legitimacy to his cause, Eriviar shall research dusty old tomes furthermore and prove his naysayers wrong."
MNC_plan_the_trip:0 "Observe The Maps"
MNC_plan_the_trip_desc:0 "The path ahead is difficult, and some may perish. From freezing weather to hostile independent griffons, Eriviar's expedition is doomed without a reliable route that must charted on the maps. Scouts shall be sent in advance to determine the most optimal method of approaching Blackstone."
MNC_get_pack_animals:0 "Hire A Few Guides"
MNC_get_pack_animals_desc:0 "The Whitetail realm, in its famed "hospitability", has not been completely mapped yet. Many intrepid explorers have been turned away by subzero temperatures and unfriendly griffons, leaving the exact number of inhabitants and settlements in the area undetermined. To prevent the humiliation of getting lost, Eriviar will hire local guides to pave the way to Blackstone."
MNC_get_a_40_man_raid_group:0 "The Raid Group"
MNC_get_a_40_man_raid_group_desc:0 "In any scenario, one must rely on loyal and capable allies to seize victory. And what a triumph will it be to take the riches of Blackstone! Eriviar shall clawpick forty of his most trustworthy subordinates, skilled shots and hardy griffons, one and all. They shall the key to success in this expedition."
MNC_go_over_the_tactics:0 "Discuss Tactical Semantics"
MNC_go_over_the_tactics_desc:0 "The colourful band of outcasts and soldiers Eriviar has gathered needs to be disciplined and prepared for anything that may occur on the long road to Blackstone. He shall go through extensive hypothesising with his griffs to get ready for any foe who might stand in the way. Eriviar has never been a kind or merciful sort to his enemies, and he intends to keep it that way."
MNC_discuss_looting_rights:0 "Figure Out Who Gets What"
MNC_discuss_looting_rights_desc:0 "Greed is a fickle thing, it drives family against each other and allies to enemies. Eriviar is well aware that if he is to maintain the loyalty of his clawpicked group, he must assure them that any loot found will be divided in a fair, merit based method. Of course, he'll keep the best pieces for himself."
MNC_appoint_raid_leaders:0 "Appoint The Lieutenants"
MNC_appoint_raid_leaders_desc:0 "Eriviar will be the first to admit he has many flaws, of course, but he is a capable ruler of griffs. A weakling would not rise to the top of the mountain clan hierarchy, but the value of delegation cannot be understated. Eriviar cannot be at all places at once, he shall appoint the most skilled underlings to keep order in his group."
MNC_the_raid_proper:0 "The Northward March"
MNC_the_raid_proper_desc:0 "With the griffons assembled, supplies gathered and strategies prepared, Eriviar is finally ready to commence his grand adventure, as he calls it so fondly. Having left his relatives to manage the day-to-day running of the realm, Eriviar shall either return as a wealthy hero, or not return at all. In his mind, he is already salivating over the prospect of riches and glory."

mountain.2.t:0 "The Road Ahead"
mountain.2.d:0 "Once more has winter wrapped the Whitetail mountains in a thick coat of snow, and many have retreated indoors to wait out the difficult season. But [MNC.GetLeader] has been anything but slothful, as he has been pouring his time and Idols into researching the myths and legends of the "Blackstone Fortress", as called by the locals. A fabled city of great splendour, built far before the unification of Griffonia, it lies to the far north of Eriviar's realm. Nogriff knows what happened to the city itself, or what was its actual name, for all that's left are pitch black stone slabs, supposedly haunted and claimed by madgriffs.\n\nBut Eriviar's interest isn't archeological. Many stories tell of great riches left in the city, which would propel a griffon to untold heights of wealth, and Eriviar is infamous for his greedy habits. His subordinates are less enthusiastic on the matter, however. With no definite proof of the fabled riches, the mountain clans resist Eriviar's attempts to fund his obsession.\n\nEriviar, however, is undeterred by simple obstructions. He has seen the wealth in his dreams, and by Boreas it will all be his. Whether his vassals like it or not."

His ragged bunch of soldiers, mercenaries, shady characters and Eriviar's personal cook was prepared and outfitted for the task ahead. Everything seemed that this would be his hour of glory.\n\nThe journey to reach Dimpeak was cleared in a remarkably short time, despite howling winds, freezing blizzards and an avalanche which forced a halt for half a day. The group, for its diversity, did not lack determination, which was further reinforced by Eriviar's promises of great wealth and his cook's warm meals. If it meant they could get an another bowl of Bo's vegetable stew, both griffons and ponies were willing to march an another mile or two.\n\nThe morning was crisp and clear as Eriviar sighted the black stone slabs which marked the location of the lost city. After a sinister encounter with the local griffons, who seemed unhinged enough that none were willing to disperse them with force, spouting outlandish prognostications of doom and gloom, the group began their search for an entryway. Surely, the entrance was simply buried under the snow, or hidden behind rubble?\n\nThe effort has paid off in dividends as one of the hired unicorn mages found that the nearby mountain contained hollow insides. With actual labour of mining and excavating out of the question due to the elements, Eriviar ordered to fire at the rock using the largest weapons they brought, and soon enough, a decent path was cleared. Orderly architecture and warm hallways enticed the group to enter and explore, and Eriviar felt smugly self-assured at his prospects of success and riches."

The gods must have been watching over them, for how else would have they prevailed against such nightmarish fiends? No griff or pony should have faced that... thing. Still, progress was made at a rapid pace, after a short exploration of the abandoned settlement that preceded the temple proper. The studious unicorns marvelled at examples of pre-Groverian architecture and wished to remain to learn more about the peculiarities of this underground structure and its inhabitants, but Eriviar would have none of it. In his mind, finding the treasure was paramount before any frivolities such as "archaeology".\n\nIt seemed that the way to riches and glory would be simple, if it weren't for the hulking brute of a warrior standing guard at the entrance, flanked by numerous lackeys. Wearing pitch black armour, oozing ichor and despair, this griffon exuded a sense of dread that made many reconsider their life choices. That, and the massive cudgel he wielded. If the previous encounters made the party wonder what horrors have they unleashed, this one had to be the worst possible one, a being of unimaginable cruelty. Of course, Eriviar would not give up so close to his goal, avarice overpowering his rational senses. Looking up to the group, the cursed champion unleashed a gravely bellow:\n\n"None shall pass! My master will not tolerate the presence of any who would defile His sanctum! All will perish who oppose Him!"\nEven if this brute looked like death walking, Eriviar was promptly unfazed by his threats, weapons or henchgriffs. "We have no quarrel with your master, you oversized can of steel! Step aside or face our firepower!"\nTo nocreature's surprise, the primitive warrior swung his mace at the group, instructing his underlings to attack.\n"Slaughter them in the glory of Maar! Let none survive!"\n\nUntroubled by the revelation of their allegiance, Eriviar was more concerned about having to do things the hard way again. Time was of the essence, and the Maarite savage had to be crushed before he could alert whatever else they had in reserve."

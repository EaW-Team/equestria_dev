 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "The End of Harmony"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A new era has dawned. Fear and uncertainty spreads amongst ponies as the world around them changes rapidly in front of their very eyes. Equestrian leadership is concerned about their neighbours, Stalliongrad and Changelings alike. While the communists in Stalliongrad rapidly industrialise, Queen Chrysalis has managed to centralise her realm around her. Equestria, while concerned about these developments, faces plenty of internal conflicts and problems. A storm is brewing in Equestria, one that friendship alone might not be able to tame."
 HITTING_FAN_NAME:0 "The Hitting of the Fan"
 HITTING_FAN_DESC:0 "Yup, that's right! That umbrella collection is about to come in real handy."
 EQS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Equestria has lived in Harmony for over a millennia under the guidance of Princess Celestia. The nation has faced many minor threats in the recent past, and has prevailed with the power of friendship and forgiveness. However, circumstances seem to be changing, as Equestria’s enemies have roused themselves and are now a credible threat The peace-loving nation of ponies now finds itself in a new world with foes at their borders, but among their numbers as well. How will Equestria approach the troubling times ahead, and will Friendship and Harmony still be its mantra?"
 CHN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Not too long ago, Queen Chrysalis and her Changelings launched a daring invasion to take over Equestria and its capital of Canterlot. Fortunately for the Equestrians, it was met with disaster. This defeat only intensified the Changelings’ hatred of ponies. Using this anger, Chrysalis has successfully gathered near-universal support for her cause, and unified all of the hives to her rule alone. Under her reign, the army has seen radical and rapid modernisation with the introduction of modern firearms, vehicles and tactics. The time is ripe for a new war, and this time the Changelings may finally achieve their ultimate victory over their enemies."
 STG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Soviet Republic of Stalliongrad, comprising of the Equestrian north-east provinces, had only recently split off from Equestria and the Crystal Empire in the hopes of forming a new society in which all ponies are equal. Unfortunately the Stalliongrad of today is far from the what had been envisioned in its founding. Rapid industrialisation has failed, and food has become scarce. With Equestrian sanctions, the threat of famine is very real. The ruling Communist Party, crippled by a leadership crisis, is incapable. Only after the following election, once the party has a clear leader, will Stalliongrad be able to face the oncoming storm."
 OLE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Home of the deers, the Kingdom of Olenia is an old trading nation. It had long been the leading trading power in its region, however political instability and corruption have caused plenty of problems. The lower classes of society suffer the most, and unrest is spreading quickly. The situation had only gotten worse following the rise of King Johan Djavulen, an unlawful and incredibly corrupt leader. The current rightful heir to the throne, Queen Velvet, has drawn up plans to retake the throne, but requires help to do so. Will the Equestrians help the Queen in need? Will the fires of revolution engulf the streets of Hjortland? Will the deers survive the changeling threat to the north?"
 CRY_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Crystal Empire is a new nation in the world stage. Long ago, it had disappeared following the defeat of the evil tyrant, King Sombra. The Empire returned along with his return a few years ago, and was ultimately freed with aid from Equestria. Now under the rule of the Equestrian princess, Mi Amore Cadenza, many wonder how the Crystal Empire will proceed in these troubled times. Will the Crystal Ponies stay loyal to Equestria, or will darkness return once more?"
 YAK_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The quiet, isolated kind of the yaks have always made it a priority to keep their traditions alive. Due to this, yaks have never shared much interest in politics, whether that be foreign and domestic. However, not even the yaks can ignore the thunderclouds gathering on the horizon, and they might finally be forced to take action. What will the future hold for the yaks? Will the yak way of life endure, or will this new age bring along a new reign?"
 GRF_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With the collapse of the Griffon's ancient Empire nearly 30 years ago Nova Griffonia has found itself independant for the first time after 200 years. However due to Nova Griffonia's over-reliance on Imperial industrial goods and military protection she has found herself suffering heavily in the recent years. Her armies are comprised of militias barely held together by their commanders, the economy has practically collapsed, to top it off the many dissidents the old Empire sent to her shores have become more active and violent than ever. The only thing keeping the country together is Governor Teafether's sheer force of will, but no one lives forever..."
 GFF_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Although an unrecognised state by everyone but Nova Griffonia, the Griffon Frontier enjoys some amount of autonomy from its master. The country is far from content, however, as its virtually non existent budget is unable to fund its industry, army or infrastructure. And now, like all the years before, it is about time for Governor Muck to visit Weter, the capital of Nova Griffonia, and ask for funds once more. He would better return with good news, as he has many enemies back at home who would love to take his place…"
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Choose a nation of your liking on the map."
 WNG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "30 years ago, Wingbardy seceded from the Empire and took the whole south with it. The King promised them a future of continued economic growth and prosperity. This couldn't have been further from the truth.\nOnce the richest lands in the Empire, Wingbardy now sees itself in crisis. The ecomony, failed parliament after parliament and a costly war with Falcor has lead to the rapid growth of political extremism. Fascists under Guiliou Beakolini prepare to march on Karthin and seize power from the failed government. The Communists have void to stop them. But the King still holds all the cards in his talons. "
 GRI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Griffonian Empire, once stretching across most of Griffonia, has long been known as ‚The sick Bird of Griffonia‘. Revolution and corruption took hold of the empire and its vast lands, breaking it apart one by one. Today, the Empire is left with nothing but a fraction of its territory, filled with dissatisfied nobles and commoners. The current Emperor, Grover V, is not expected to have long left until death claims his life, and with his only heir to the throne being underage, the Empire is soon to face crisis, once more. Will the Empire survive this new age? Will internal conflict shatter it once and for all? Can imperial glory be reclaimed, once more?"
 AET_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The County of Greifwald has for long been a nation that has mastered the art of balancing between many powers on the griffin continent, as it's located directly in the middle between the Kingdom of Aquellia and The Griffonian Empire. The current establishment of Greifwald has ruled for long already, but the County is troubled by many problems. It's citizens are poor, it's army and industry greatly obsolete. And while the current regime tries it's best to keep everything stable, there exists a small but hardworking anarchistic party there, that could pose a great threat to the government. But more worryingly, there are whispers in the dark of Prelate Ebonwing's great ambitions and plans..."
 TRD_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Skyfall Trade Federation is currently the odd-man out on the Griffonian continent, as in opposition to other countries in Griffonia, the Trade Federation has prospered while the Empire has been declining, and is prospering even now. Yet, even the Federation is plagued by few issues, deep class divide, the greatest organized strike in the entire Griffonian History. And Budget that is, frankly, a mess. But one of the most worrying problems Skyfall faces is the so called ''Woodpecker Society''. Entirely made up of wealthy and powerful griffons. The Trade Federation is currently standing at a crossroads, it's future might be a model for all of Griffonia, or... maybe a warning to all of Griffonia..."
 JER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of Aquileia is one of the oldest nation on the Griffonian continent. It was around when the Empire was unified for the first time, and it was also one of the first nations who left it. But after that happened, Aquileia itself suffered a coup where it was transformed into a republic, but just like with the Empire, it didn't last. Yet, memories of the republic are not dead yet. And that isn't aren't the only problems Aquileia faces, as ever since Aquileia left the Empire, it has been a sort of Rival to it, and if the Empire would try to revitalize itself, Aquileia would be the first strong enemy that they would have to face. But would Aquileia be strong enough to face them?"
 GRW_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Griffon Liberation Army movement was born in the Kingdom of Brodfeld. Sparked by brutality of the king the revolutionary spirit of the griffons of Prywhen inspired an organization of the resistance against the bourgeoise. It managed to capture the popular support of peasants and workers throughout the country. For two years a devastating civil war is going on, more charactarized by guerilla warfare and raids than a full-scale war. But now the peasants and the proletariat have picked themselves up to make the final push into the royalists' nest of vipers. From there on, Prywhen will finally have a chance to decide their own destiny."

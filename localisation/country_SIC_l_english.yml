 SIC_urgent_parish_meeting:0 "The 1st 1007 Conclave of the Parishes"
 SIC_urgent_parish_meeting_desc:0 "Fears and tension caused by the chaos across the Griffonian continent over the last 40 years have finally come to a head in Sicameon. The two houses of our legislature, the Tribunal Urbes and the Parratoria, have come together to grant our previously highly decentralized national government more power than it has ever wielded before. How should we proceed?"
 SIC_midoria_plan:0 "The Midoria Plan"
 SIC_midoria_plan_desc:0 "Named for the greater level centralization it entails, its' favor with the city tribunes and spearheaded by the Tribune of Midoria Remige Plumar, this plan proposes a radical empowerment of our central government as desired by the PIS-R. While it would shake our national tradition of placing personal liberty above all else, the radicals insist that we must vest this power to have a hope of maintaining at all."
 SIC_epios_plan:0 "The Leve Plan"
 SIC_epios_plan_desc:0 "Named for the conservative approach to centralization favored by the moderate PIS-M and the majority of the parroquias, this plan proposes a more graduated approach to empowering our central government, to prevent potential abuses of power. The overall weakness of the government as prescribed in the Carta Federal is to balance the power between the parishes and capitol, this balance can be maintained."
 SIC_aggressive_foreign_policy:0 "Pursuing Aggressive Foreign Policy"
 SIC_aggressive_foreign_policy_desc:0 "An aggressive, proactive foreign policy is vital to the Midoria Plan. Long have we sat back and been a responsive force rather than taking initiative in our foreign affairs."
 SIC_sweeping_power:0 "Sweeping Executive Power"
 SIC_sweeping_power_desc:0 "A strong central government in Midoria is both vital and viable in this coming age. With telegraph and telephone wires and radio, we no longer are forced to rely on deferring to the Parishes for many issues, and thus we can direct the nation much more efficiently."
 SIC_checks_balances:0 "Checks and Balances"
 SIC_checks_balances_desc:0 "By creating a complex system of where the legislature, the dux, and the federal courts can counteract each other if one steps out of line, we can ensure that no one part of our national government will be able to seize all power, while unanimously beneficial decisions will always pass through."
 SIC_defensive_foreign_policy:0 "Defensive Foreign Policy"
 SIC_defensive_foreign_policy_desc:0 "Contrary to what is believed within the PIS-R, a defensive foreign policy is still viable. We should be willing and open to approach nations that we previously have been on tense terms with to secure allies, rather than rattling the saber with demands."
 SIC_commander_in_chief:0 "Dux, Commander-in-Chief"
 SIC_commander_in_chief_desc:0 "The Dux historically has been nearly a ceremonial post, acting as a mere advisor to the legislature, as our national representative to foreign powers, and as the symbolic supreme commander of the militias. Our national executive’s responsibilities should be expanded to be a more decisive force."
 SIC_separation_of_militias:0 "Separation of Militia and Central Government"
 SIC_separation_of_militias_desc:0 "The parish militias have always been a distinctly locally managed institution. While we may introduce more strenuous standards and assist the parishes in funding and equipment uniformity, we should not interfere with the local defense forces unless the situation absolutely requires it."
 SIC_standing_national_guard:0 "A Standing National Guard"
 SIC_standing_national_guard_desc:0 "While we have not necessarily been without a national army, the Guardia Nacional de Sicameon has since its inception almost always been a small force, the sole exception being the Imperial Invasion of 799 ALB. Laying the ground work for greater reliance on our professional military rather than the parish militias will be vital in this coming era."
 SIC_integrate_militias:0 "Integrate the Parish Militias"
 SIC_integrate_militias_desc:0 "The defense of our nation has always relied on the common griffon willing to defend their home, but while valiant, the reliance on individual militias within each parish makes our a disorganized mess in both coordination and logistics. Integrating them into a standardized national system would make these local defense forces far more effective."
 SIC_federal_supremacy_clause:0 "The Federal Supremacy Clause"
 SIC_federal_supremacy_clause_desc:0 "Our national government has always deferred to the parishes in the grand majority of affairs, each and every parish treated as the federal government’s equal. By establishing the central government as the supreme authority, we can enforce far more consistent standards and uniformity."
 SIC_rights_people_parishes:0 "Rights of the People and the Parishes"
 SIC_rights_people_parishes_desc:0 "The parishes and the griffons that live within each parish have fundamental rights that should be upheld, for the national government derives all power from them. While federal actions can be streamlined to increase their effectiveness, every griffon and every parish shall still have their say."
 SIC_strong_gov_strong_nation:0 "A Strong Government, A Stronger Nation"
 SIC_strong_gov_strong_nation_desc:0 "While the voice of every parish and every griffon within them will still be valued and acted upon as they have always been, the long overdue establishment of a swift, supreme authority within our republic will finally allow us to truly contest the power of our neighbors and harness the true powers of our liberty."

Despite the only ever rising cries of the radicals, we have secured power in the now ever more important executive office with the incumbent Alexis taking the seat of dux again. However, work to unify our nation against the outside threats has only just begun. With bickering filling the Tribunal and the Parratoria, we must remind them what we all stand for."
 SIC_more_than_peasant_republic:0 "More than a Peasant's Republic"
 SIC_more_than_peasant_republic_desc:0 "The western Griffonian nations have long looked down on us for our egalitarian principles, and while we have accepted the title of 'peasant' with pride, it is time we show them we are more than that. We must rally our peoples again, the radicals, the corsairs, every Sicameonese griffon and show we are the herald of democracy, and we are not to be trifled with."
 SIC_looking_outward:0 "Looking Outward"
 SIC_looking_outward_desc:0 "With our internal politics mostly secured, we can finally begin to reach out to our neighbors and begin acting in international affairs. The safety of our sovereignty depends on it."
 SIC_incorporating_the_radicals:0 "Incorporating the Radicals"
 SIC_incorporating_the_radicals_desc:0 "Despite their aggressive outlook, the radicals are still our brothers and sisters and share the same basic love of freedom as we do. Their ferocity is simply an untamed love of these ideals and our great republic, and it should be accepted."
 SIC_unwavering_reason:0 "Unwavering Reason"
 SIC_unwavering_reason_desc:0 "The staunchest griffons within our ranks have often promoted a policy of Unwavering Reason in regards to the radicals, under no circumstances should we accept their rash and headstrong ideas. They will learn to understand and become more calm minded."
 SIC_separation_of_church_state:0 "Seperation of Faith and State"
 SIC_separation_of_church_state_desc:0 "Despite the graciousness of Sycaecia and all the blessings she has granted our fair republic, there now needs to be a distinct seperation between Her temples and the government. We value Her word and advice, but it is ultimately up to the will of the people."
 SIC_discrediting_privateers:0 "Discrediting the Freeholders"
 SIC_discrediting_privateers_desc:0 "The illegitimate menace that are the Freeholder Corsairs must end. While they masquerade behind masks of Hooded Robins, allowing such powerful homegrown activity to fester will only lead down a dark path of corruption. We must expose them for who they really are."
 SIC_embracing_blue_grey:0 "Embracing the Blue and the Grey"
 SIC_embracing_blue_grey_desc:0 "Though the Freeholders are largely an illegitimate organization with deep criminal ties, they still are very much a part of Sicameonese history and still care deeply for their home country. Perhaps they can be legitimized and reformed into something better."
 SIC_red_defense_ministry:0 "A Red Defense Ministry"
 SIC_red_defense_ministry_desc:0 "Naturally, we have found the best place for our radical brethren is in the armed defense of the federation. Many of our best officers are among their ranks, their passion will ensure we have a ready and able military."
 SIC_ONI:0 "The Office of Naval Intelligence"
 SIC_ONI_desc:0 "Our naval intelligence officers have found that the seemingly bottomless depths of the Corsairs' connections are an incredibly valuable source of information. We've determined that an entire agency would be required to effectively and discreetly incorporate and utilize these underworld connections, thusly it will be handled by the new Office of Naval Intelligence."
 SIC_united_in_purpose:0 "United in Purpose"
 SIC_united_in_purpose_desc:0 "Through one way or another, we have reconciled the differences between the different groups of our federation. We stand together, united in purpose, to defend our liberties and our republic at any cost."
 SIC_national_philanthropy:0 "National Philanthropy"
 SIC_national_philanthropy_desc:0 "While the merchants of the Western Griffonian nations largely sit atop their accumulated wealth scheming only on how to acquire more of it, the merchant class of Sicameon have long held a tradition of outgoing charity. In this modern age, these traditions should be expanded to that of philanthropy: to eliminate the source of the issues and advance our nation as a whole, rather than only alleviating the suffering."
 SIC_citizen_soldier:0 "The Citizen Soldier"
 SIC_citizen_soldier_desc:0 "The idea of the citizen soldier is an ancient one, spanning back to even before the Karthin Empire. We have maintained this idea to the modern day, if it comes down to it, every Sicameonese citizen is obligated to defend their republic, but at the same time it is a sound reminder to value every life lost in the line of duty."
 SIC_welfare_worker:0 "Welfare for the Worker"
 SIC_welfare_worker_desc:0 "The traditions of economic fairness and placing well-being over wealth are strong in our nation, but even these are susceptible to the rough ebb and flow of the market. Establishing a proper welfare system for times of economic recession should secure the well-being of both our people and our economy."
 SIC_jojo_bizarre_adventure:0 "Jojo's Bizarre Situation"
 SIC_jojo_bizarre_adventure_desc:0 "During the Wingbardy-Falcor War, there was a great deal of worry over the security of Sicameonese waters which came to a head over the tiny islands of Jo and Jo, which we occupied to protect the large Sicameonese population there and limit Wingbardian intrusion. If we want to successfully attempt to negotiate with the highly revanchist Falcor, we may need to take them into consideration."
 SIC_appeasing_blackrock:0 "Appeasing the Bandit Queen"
 SIC_appeasing_blackrock_desc:0 "We have watched the chaos north of the mountains in the County of Blackhollow and witnessed Blackrock's brutality. Some of our diplomats believe that a confrontation should be avoided, and by getting on the Bandit Queen's good graces by offering an embellished olive branch before she comes seeking tribute, we can get in her good graces and use her as a roadblock between us and the chaotic Empire."
 SIC_invade_blackhallow:0 "Restore Order to Blackhollow"
 SIC_invade_blackhallow_desc:0 "We have watched the chaos north of the mountains in the County of Blackhollow and witnessed Blackrock's brutality. Some of our army staff believe that a confrontation will be inevitable, and that this would be a valuable opportunity to test our army's mettle in the offensive. Further more, we could use the territory to prop up a buffer state or gain Griffonstone's favor to protect us from the Empire."
 SIC_looking_further_outward:0 "Looking Further Outward"
 SIC_looking_further_outward_desc:0 "With our immediate neighbors more or less secured whether by force of arms or diplomacy, we can begin to look farther afield to support causes aligned with ours."
 SIC_invade_cyanolisia:0 "Doing What the Minotaurs Can't"
 SIC_invade_cyanolisia_desc:0 "Somehow up to this point our Asterionese friends seem to have been either sluggish or unable to reclaim their mainland territories. It seems it will be up to us to restore liberty and democracy to our long oppressed minotaur brethren."
 SIC_wingbardy_detente:0 "Wingbardian Detente"
 SIC_wingbardy_detente_desc:0 "Despite long being fellows under the ancient Karthin Empire, these past thousand years have put us at odds with Wingbardy, first as economic rivals during the confederation period, and then as military enemies when they were under the claw of the Grovers. With the Empire's collapse, perhaps now could be the time to start anew with the Jewel of the South."
 SIC_striped_slavers:0 "Striking at the Striped Slavers"
 SIC_striped_slavers_desc:0 "Though they are far less prevelent now, for centuries in the past the zebra colony to the northeast has raided the southern Griffonian coast and stands as an unholy bastion of slavery. Though they are not the sole remaining slavers in Griffonia, snuffing them out and teaching them of equality will go a long way in ending the abhorrent practice."
 SIC_open_talon:0 "An Open Talon to Gryphus"
 SIC_open_talon_desc:0 "We have fairly close ties to Gryphus, over the years their cities have been common ports of call for our merchants and many of them have settled there. They share our democratic and decentralized form of government which empowers local municipalities, and historically we have invested much in their development through the CCSG. In these uncertain times we should seek closer ties and work together."
 SIC_modern_earthworks:0 "The Modern Earthworks Study"
 SIC_modern_earthworks_desc:0 "With the rise of mechanized warfare, most older forms of fortifications have become largely obsolete, and even the mighty Snowtops and Arahno Mountains are considerably less consequential. A nationwide project should be launched to study and then construct modernized fortifications for the continued defense of the federation."
 SIC_skyfall_best_commodity:0 "Skyfall's Greatest Commodity"
 SIC_skyfall_best_commodity_desc:0 "Thanks to Skyfall's incredibly advantageous position between the most advanced nations in the world, naturally their marketplace is the ripest place to purchase technology. We should exercise our old trade connections with the city and show we are looking to buy, everything in Skyfall has a price."
 SIC_recognize_republic:0 "Recognizing the Griffonian Republic"
 SIC_recognize_republic_desc:0 "During the original Republican Revolution we refrained from making any official statement about the Griffonian Republic, focusing on our quiet exit from the Empire and assisting our allies in Asterion. With our own republic now standing taller and stronger than ever before, it's high time for the first griffon republic to support the next."
 SIC_eastern_investment:0 "Investing in Our Eastern Twin"
 SIC_eastern_investment_desc:0 "It has been far too long since we had lost control of the Compañía Continental del sur de Gryphus. While the company is largely self sufficient now, Gryphus has likely receieved significantly less capital to continue building up their infrastructure without our support. We should resume these efforts in earnest."
 SIC_republic_attache:0 "Sending a Military Attache to the Republic"
 SIC_republic_attache_desc:0 "With new, friendly relations established with the leaders of the Republic, it's now possible to begin sending military support to the northern struggle. While it's infeasible to send a large force all the way north, we can send a contingent of our officers to advise in our potentially useful tactics, as well as learn from their war experience."
 SIC_guarding_our_sister:0 "Guarding Our Sister Nation"
 SIC_guarding_our_sister_desc:0 "We cannot stand idle for any longer. The continent is in complete chaos with ambitious warmongers, and many have their hungry eyes set on our sister nation. We must take up arms to protect her with all our might if griffon democracy is to continue to flourish in the southeast."
 SIC_guardians_of_democracy:0 "The Vanguard of Democracy"
 SIC_guardians_of_democracy_desc:0 "Though it's impractical to send an actual portion of our army to assist in the wars of the north, we have amassed three divisions worth of volunteers willing to risk their lives in the name of a continental republic. We wish our vangaurd of brave young sons and daughters Sycaecia's blessings on the battlefields of the frigid north."

We have finally overcome the long standing moderate status quo, with our valiant new dux Remige Plumar, now rightfully a de Sicameon, in the now incredibly important executive office. However, the waves of change have only just begun to rise, we must still defeat our moderate rivals in the Parratoria and the Tribunal if we wish to institute true syndicalism."
 SIC_handle_harmonists:0 "How to Handle the Moderates"
 SIC_handle_harmonists_desc:0 "Despite the celebration of our long awaited victory, a new debate has come to the forefront. The moderates, while our long standing rivals, are still fellow brothers and sisters. But one way or another, we have to convince them of our methodology... Do we approach with outstretched talon or a fist?"
 SIC_penalize_harmonists:0 "Penalize the Moderates"
 SIC_penalize_harmonists_desc:0 "We will continue as we always have with our moderate rivals, with aggression and zeal! While the middling members of our party believe this is too close to coercion, in the end it is for the good of unity."
 SIC_might_makes_right:0 "Might Will Make Right"
 SIC_might_makes_right_desc:0 "One of our core principles and the one that the moderates always seem to find the most abhorrent, we believe it is through power and strength we will maintain liberty and freedom, and it is through might we will make them understand this philosophy."
 SIC_incentives_for_harmonists:0 "Incentives for the Moderates"
 SIC_incentives_for_harmonists_desc:0 "Perhaps showing our fellows in the moderates that we are not all hack and slash will be the most effective way to sway them to our side, particularly those who remain on the fence. We will bend if it means unity."
 SIC_reason_tempers_passion:0 "Reason Tempers Passion"
 SIC_reason_tempers_passion_desc:0 "Like how water tempers a blade, the reason of the moderate tempers the passion of the radical. Though the fiercest of us find this arrangement to be betraying our principles of strength, it is only together that we will maintain liberty and freedom."
 SIC_divine_issue:0 "The Divine Issue"
 SIC_divine_issue_desc:0 "Our party as a whole have long been particularly devout servants to Sycaecia and some of the more extremist elements of the Her temples have long been a part of our cause, but now that we finally have victory, our differences are beginning to show. Do we align the temples to us, or align ourselves to the temples?"
 SIC_supreme_pontiff:0 "Dux, Supreme Pontiff"
 SIC_supreme_pontiff_desc:0 "Since the foundation of the federation, the Dux has ceremonially served as the Supreme Pontiff of Her Temples, but the position has little to no power. This will change however as we move to exercise our authority over the temples, the Dux will have similar power as he does in executive office."
 SIC_reorganize_church:0 "Reorganizing the National Temples"
 SIC_reorganize_church_desc:0 "For far too long the temples have largely been seperate from our national government. We are all subject to Sycaecia's will, but the national importance of Her temples is too great to allow them to run unchecked."
 SIC_pontificate_blessing:0 "Gaining the Blessing of Her Pontiffs"
 SIC_pontificate_blessing_desc:0 "It is far too dangerous to tamper with Her temples, who have been distinctly apolitical since the founding of the federation. To interfere in the matters of Her temples would be asking for accusations of going against Sycaecia's will, seeking the blessings and support of the Pontificado is the much safer course of action."
 SIC_sycaecia_vanguard:0 "Sycaecia's Loyal Vanguard"
 SIC_sycaecia_vanguard_desc:0 "We will prove to all of our fellow griffons that we are loyal servants of Sycaecia and that even in our aggression and tough policies, we would not dare defy her word nor the word of her pontiffs. We will however fight in her name and in her honor!"

 SIC_codify_sicameonism:0 "Codify Sicameonese Syndicalism"
 SIC_codify_sicameonism_desc:0 "For centuries our uniquely egalitarian and syndicalist traditions have remained just that: traditions.

 SIC_officialize_the_syndicates:0 "Officialize the Syndicates"
 SIC_officialize_the_syndicates_desc:0 "Like our traditions, the syndicates, going by different names such as guilds or companies, have largely been unofficial affairs. Under our new administration, they will become official economic entities with legal rights and powers."
 SIC_separate_syndicates:0 "Separate Syndicates from Parishes"
 SIC_separate_syndicates_desc:0 "Syndicalism, like many other left wing ideologies, ultimately is an economic doctrine in its purest form. We should seperate the syndicates and the parishes, to allow the syndicates to focus more greatly on economic concerns while the parishes can continue their previous duties without the burden of economics."
 SIC_establish_fourth_branch:0 "Establish the Fourth Branch"
 SIC_establish_fourth_branch_desc:0 "Handling the economy of an advanced industrialized nation such as ours within a greater globalizing world is a nearly insurmountable task, and it's only going to grow more difficult as time goes on.

 SIC_replace_parishes:0 "Replace the Parishes"
 SIC_replace_parishes_desc:0 "Syndicalism, like many other left wing ideologies, ultimately is an economic doctrine in its purest form. Therefore the republic should be ruled from its primary economic unit, the syndicate, and the parishes should be abolished. The Tribunal will be maintained due to the economic importance of the cities."
 SIC_syndical_legislature:0 "A Syndical Legislature"
 SIC_syndical_legislature_desc:0 "With the replacement of the Parratoria with the Asemblea de Sindicatos, we have created a true economic democracy, and have proven that syndicalism as a feasible system of government and as a successful economic system."

 SIC_flush_out_rats:0 "Flushing Out the Wharf Rats"
 SIC_flush_out_rats_desc:0 "For far too long we have been too soft and too disorganized on rooting out organized crime within our borders, it tarnishes our fierce reputation towards villainous pirates and raider scum.

 SIC_resurgent_republic:0 "A Resurgent Republic"
 SIC_resurgent_republic_desc:0 "With the turn of the millennium it seemed probable that our time in the sun could end, that our prominence could wane as the more industrialized and ambitious nations of Griffonia pulled ahead, but these fears have been squashed! We are united and we are ready to do whatever it takes to preserve our great federation!"
 SIC_reservists_to_soldiers:0 "Reservists to Career Soldiers"
 SIC_reservists_to_soldiers_desc:0 "Throughout our history the duties of a soldier have largely been a part time occupation, done on the side of a civilian life. While sufficient in the past, in this modern age it produces subpar soldiers. We must create a professional military upon which a griffon can make a living upon, to fill our ranks career soldiers, griffons who's only calling is to defend their republic."
 SIC_establish_republican_guards:0 "Establish the Guardias Republicanos"
 SIC_establish_republican_guards_desc:0 "Even with the distinction of professional troops over part time militias, there is yet a further distinction to be had.

 SIC_valentin_prodegies_desc:0 "Valentin Glacialez has easily been our finest general of this recent age, having fought in the northern republican revolutions and then managing to escape home alive and with a great deal of experience. However, he knows he is growing old, and thus has passed on his hard earned wisdom to his closest officers."
 SIC_peasant_frugality:0 "A Peasant's Frugality"
 SIC_peasant_frugality_desc:0 "To western Griffonia, there are few enviable traits that they see in a peasant, but there is one that describes us well: great efficiency and ingenuity using very little, or simply frugality. With a few simple policies and appeals to our patriotic duty, we can take this efficiency to new heights to the benefit of our economy."
 SIC_national_syndiate:0 "The National Syndicate"
 SIC_national_syndiate_desc:0 "In a government designed to be owned and operated by the people and their syndicates, the idea of nationalization of businesses or resources is abhorrent. Such steps however need to be taken in the name of war preparedness, and this can be done faithfully to our principles by establishing a national syndicate of government workers."
 SIC_free_industrial_might:0 "Free Industrial Might"

 SIC_bring_down_falcon_desc:0 "The weak and yet so fiercely revanchist Falcor has long been a great thorn in our side, claiming ownership over the islands of Falcor and the city of Sudfolk which are rightfully Sicameonese! We will have both, and the rest of their territory as spoils!"

 SIC_abolish_grover_tactics_desc:0 "The age of lines and squares of griffons marching in step, of loading and firing and charging on command, of dash and fire, die schönen säbel, los hermosos sables, is over. This large body of knowledge has been rendered obsolete with the advent of modern war; though we have never fought conventionally in the eyes of our adversaries, we should take care not to employ now suicidal strategy."
 SIC_sycaecia_sappers:0 "¡Zapadores de Sycaecia, No Pasarán!"
 SIC_sycaecia_sappers_desc:0 "Originally the name for the brave peasants who had risked themselves by releasing the levees and dikes to flood out Grover II’s invasion force at the 2nd Battle of the Keowen River, this name has been carried on by our military engineer corps. Combat engineering is proving to be essential in modern warfare and it is paramount that the Sappers are well equipped to maintain their legacy on the modern battlefield."
 SIC_arahno_montaneros:0 "Los Montañeros de Arahno"
 SIC_arahno_montaneros_desc:0 " Our hardy griffon mountaineers that live in the valley of Arahno Ridge, between the Arahno Mountains and the Snowtops, have always been some of our best troops, often being the first to engage in our storied historic battles. We should mold these units into modern fighting forces who will be unmatched no matter what peak they fight on."
 SIC_scarlet_marinas:0 "Los Marines de Escarlata"
 SIC_scarlet_marinas_desc:0 "The Scarlet Marines have their origins in the defenders of the old Protectorate of Isla Escarlata. The island is a natural barrier to the mainland, the griffons who live there skilled at fighting on the beaches and boarding hostile vessels, protecting the peninsula from raiders. Their legacy lives on, and they deserve no less than the best should we need them to defend the Armada or to storm a foreign beachhead."
 SIC_wireless_coordination:0 "Wireless Coordination"
 SIC_wireless_coordination_desc:0 "The practicality of radio for use on land is only just becoming viable in our nation, with some of our first radio commercial towers still under construction in our cities. Despite this, we have seen the value of wireless coordination in the Armada Nacional’s experimental operations aboard ships and should make attempts to miniaturize this technology for the militias and Guardia Nacional."
 SIC_defensive_dykes_focus:0 "Defensive Dikes"
 SIC_defensive_dykes_focus_desc:0 "We have always proven to be able to throw up a defense with whatever may be on claw, famously the sea dikes and river levees around the city of Keowen. Even in this new age of tanks and trucks, we can still hone this tactic of sudden fortification to put up stiff defenses anywhere."
 SIC_unconventional_mobility:0 "Unconventional Mobility"
 SIC_unconventional_mobility_desc:0 "We have never truly fought toe to toe with a large enemy force when we could dictate the terms of engagement, instead always opting to be on the move, striking at the flanks and encircling to sow confusion, through seemingly impassable terrain with novel solutions. It is this mobile ingenuity that we can hone to become a lightning army that can envelope a target before they know what's happening."
 SIC_peasants_not_knights:0 "Peasants, Not Knights"
 SIC_peasants_not_knights_desc:0 "Anywhere else in Griffonia, to be called a peasant is to be called a poor, lowly soul, hardly a griffon at all. But here in Sicameon, we carry such a title with pride, for we can fell any knight, lord, or kaiser should they come our way, we can prosper without such insane notions of feudalism and royalty. And our finest griffons, the Rediarios, are ever ready to ensnare and slay any foolish Seguidor!"
 SIC_procure_modern_equipment:0 "Procuring Modern Equipment"
 SIC_procure_modern_equipment_desc:0 "While our military forces are not the least advanced in the world, the pace of arms and equipment innovation is accelerating rapidly. We should strive to equip our troops with the latest in repeating firearms, smokeless powder, protective helmets, etc."
 SIC_repurpose_agricultural_machines:0 "Repurpose Agricultural Machines"
 SIC_repurpose_agricultural_machines_desc:0 "The mechanization of agriculture has proven to be a boon for our inland farmers, exponentially increasing productivity with their power to move mass quantities of material and prepare greater areas for growing. We can harness these trucks and tractors to move men, supplies, and equipment instead, and thus create much more mobile forces."
 SIC_refit_old_cannons:0 "Refitting Old Cannons"
 SIC_refit_old_cannons_desc:0 "While our artillery corps is largely outdated, mostly consisting of rifled muzzleloaders and breechloaders still firing outdated ammunition, these old guns can be retrofitted with modern carriages, gun shields, recoil mechanisms, and in some cases be rebored, reinforced, and rechambered to fire modern ammunition."
 SIC_allinas_process_modernization:0 "Allinas Process Modernization"
 SIC_allinas_process_modernization_desc:0 "Developed by prolific Allinas Aceropico at Estrella Arms, the Allinas Process is a set of modernization plans for most old firearms in parish and national arsenals to methodically update them to all fire smokeless powder and become either single shot breechloading rifles for reserve use or bring them up to date with the current national service weapon standards."
 SIC_knight_killing_machine:0 "A Knight Slaying Machine"
 SIC_knight_killing_machine_desc:0 "By applying armor plating and a heavy weapon such as a light artillery cannon in such a manner as we would with a warship onto a heavy truck or tractor, we can create a vehicle that is tougher, more heavily armed, and more mobile than any knight. Such machines are already being adopted here in Griffonia and across the sea."
 SIC_adapting_naval_artillery:0 "Adapting Naval Artillery"
 SIC_adapting_naval_artillery_desc:0 "The Armada Nacional has always been leagues ahead of the militias and the Gaurdia Nacional in terms of equipment and weaponry. Some of the lighter secondary batteries could be easily adapted for use on land as field guns, as a ready source of artillery and artillery designs for the militias, and create a degree of standardization with the navy."
 SIC_sycamore_armory:0 "Founding the Sycamore National Armory"
 SIC_sycamore_armory_desc:0 "Sicameon up until this point has never had a national arms factory, as with most other functions of government we have always deferred arms and equipment production to city armories, and more recently, indigenous arms companies such as Estrella. In our bid to increase federal level military capability and self reliance, we should establish a national armory to fulfill the equipment needs of the Guardia Nacional."
 SIC_plowshares_to_swords:0 "Plowshares to Swords"
 SIC_plowshares_to_swords_desc:0 "The Sicameonese people have always had a culture of duality. In peace, we have wielded the trident and the pitchfork to fish and farm to feed our families. In war, we wielded the same to hold the enemy back and defend our liberties. Let us embrace that fact in this new era, as we prepare for the inevitable wars to come!"
 
 ##navy tree
 SIC_unify_flotillas:0 "Formally Unify the Armada Nacional"
 SIC_unify_flotillas_desc:0 "The nation’s navy has historically been far more unified than the parish militias and the Guardia Nacional, because the founding Five Cities were the only entities wealthy enough to fund naval projects, and they all shared the mutual goal of fending off raiders and pirates from the very beginning. Still, the Armada Nacional is divided along the lines of the old city flotillas, these old systems should be replaced to promote unity, end city rivalries, and ease administration."
 SIC_new_naval_infrastructure:0 "New Naval Infrastructure"
 SIC_new_naval_infrastructure_desc:0 "While Sicameon is by no means a navally primitive nation with its historically important trade ports and sole worship of the griffon sea goddess, the ever expanding specialized needs and ever growing overall size of modern ships demand ever more advanced construction and maintenance facilities and more deeply dredged harbors."
 SIC_naval_base_1:0 "Expanding the Escarlata Naval Base"
 SIC_naval_base_1_desc:0 "Isla Escarlata has long stood as a natural defensive barrier between the western seas and the peninsular mainland, and as a good naval post and staging ground for sailing westward as well. These facilities should be modernized for continued service for the foreseeable future."
 SIC_naval_base_2:0 "Expanding the Midoria Naval Base"
 SIC_naval_base_2_desc:0 "Our nation’s capitol has always been a great port of call for seafarers of all kinds, sitting at the geographical center of the southern coast of Griffonia, and the closest continental mainland port to Zebrica. The naval facilities in Midoria should be continuously modernized and expanded with this importance in mind."
 SIC_dockyard_expansion_2:0 "Expanding the Queruscos Shipyards"
 SIC_dockyard_expansion_2_desc:0 "Queruscos has long held the title to have both the finest and the most productive heavy shipyards within the federation. Historically, the city arsenal created an innovative proto-assembly line system that could create an entire ship within a day, where other cities could take weeks and other nations months. Such a legacy of industry should be upheld by expanding and modernizing the cities shipbuilding facilities further."
 SIC_dockyard_expansion_1:0 "Expanding the Eritocefalia Drydocks"
 SIC_dockyard_expansion_1_desc:0 "Long benefitting from trade with Griffonia's eastern nations and always in constant competition with the capitol of Cyanolisia, Eritocefalia's shipyards have been well renowned its' for smaller, nimbler, and more efficient clippers and frigates. Thus naturally the city has supplied the Armada Nacional with many of its' fine fast craft, and modernizing and expanding the city's drydocks is a high priority."
 SIC_light_dockyards:0 "Light Dockyard Standardization"
 SIC_light_dockyards_desc:0 "By cementing our naval doctrine into solely lighter vessels as we have in the past, we have the choice to standardize all of our shipbuilding and maintenance facilities to these smaller craft, resulting in smaller, more efficient, and cheaper infrastructure, but at the cost of our ability to build heavier ships."
 SIC_flexible_dockyards:0 "Flexible Dockyard Standardization"
 SIC_flexible_dockyards_desc:0 "With the major expansions of our navy into much larger ship designs than the past, we now have the experience to standardize our shipbuilding and maintenance facilities to streamline production all kinds of naval craft."
 SIC_naval_review:0 "The New Millennium Naval Review"
 SIC_naval_review_desc:0 "The purpose of a naval review is twofold: to celebrate our long held connections and traditions with the sea and our beloved goddess, and functionally to amass the Armada Nacional for review by our admiralty. Historically it’s been a day of competition between the city flotillas, but this time the fleet sails as one!"
 SIC_analyze_merchant_marine:0 "Analyze the Marina Mercante"
 SIC_analyze_merchant_marine_desc:0 "Being a major trading nation has meant that historically our merchant marine has always been an incredibly important asset to us, both economically and to our maritime defense. While we cannot build merchant ships equivalent to the old East Hindiagriffs of old, we can still look into integrating precautions and developing special tactics for our navy to better protect our merchants on the high seas."
 SIC_prepare_against_piracy:0 "Preparations Against Convoy Raids"
 SIC_prepare_against_piracy_desc:0 "The Marina Mercante has developed based on historical experience a modernized version of our coastal defensive patrols to defend our convoys on the open seas, extending Sycaecia's protecting wing far beyond our coasts."
 SIC_merchant_cruiser:0 "The Destroyer Escort"
 SIC_merchant_cruiser_desc:0 "The history of battle on the seas has repeated itself, only instead of pirates and privateers preying on well to do merchants for personal gain, it’s one nation’s destroyers and submarines and aircraft against another’s civilian convoys. This time however, we can amass a fleet of escorts that is both economically feasible and long enough ranged to protect our convoys anywhere."
 SIC_new_screens:0 "New Screening Vessels"
 SIC_new_screens_desc:0 "From mere sailing sloops to swarming torpedo boats to anti-submarine destroyers and anti-aircraft light cruisers, the naval screen has evolved immensely over the last century and a half, and we have been able to keep pace with it. But the march of progress never stops, even on the waves, so we must continue the designing, innovation, and construction of these steadfast vessels."
 SIC_ASW_warfare:0 "Spearing the Modern Sea Serpent"
 SIC_ASW_warfare_desc:0 "The invention of the fully submersible ship, while wondrous, has opened up a vast new element of naval warfare where an enemy can stalk our merchants and battlefleets like the mythic sea monsters of yore. New weapons and detection systems will have to be developed to hunt down these new steel sea predators."
 SIC_mine_warfare:0 "The Venerable Sea Mine"
 SIC_mine_warfare_desc:0 "The naval mine at this point is an aging invention, but one that has proven still deadly and only growing more lethal despite advances in underwater protection. Minefields have long been part of the theoretical defense of our coastal waters and ports, sitting in many narrows and natural bays, and these plans and their related technologies should continue to be modernized."
 SIC_cruiser_tradition:0 "Sicameonese Cruiser Tradition"
 SIC_cruiser_tradition_desc:0 "Historically, the cruiser has been our capital ship, our nation’s naval pride. While this mantle may pass onto larger and more powerful ships in the future, the cruiser still has a crucial role to play in this new, modern maritime age with its’ great flexibility."
 SIC_aircraft_carrier:0 "An Aircraft Carrier"
 SIC_aircraft_carrier_desc:0 "Many of the younger officers who have grown up with the latest innovations of mechanized flying machines have proposed the idea of creating a ship that is in essence a floating airfield. The concept has already been proven overseas in Equestria and by the Empire before it had collapsed on itself, and we have concluded some of our own first tests of launching aircraft off of an armed warship successfully. Despite the skepticism of some of our older officers, such a dedicated ship might prove to be a potent weapon in the future"
 SIC_secondary_battery_research:0 "A Secondary Education"
 SIC_secondary_battery_research_desc:0 "As our ships grow further and further in size, we find ourselves actually somewhat lacking in one aspect of naval design: secondary batteries. But we are learning quickly, and adapted weaponry from our smaller craft should fit the role soundly."
 SIC_undersea_patrol:0 "An Undersea Patrol"
 SIC_undersea_patrol_desc:0 "The idea to build a ship that can swim within Sycaecia’s vast seas as the fish and other aquatic denizens do is an old one in our mythology, but only became possible relatively recently. While we have already achieved such a marvel of engineering, continuing to pursue advances in submarining will allow us to protect our waters in ways never thought possible before."
 SIC_torpedo_research:0 "The Ship Killing Harpoon"
 SIC_torpedo_research_desc:0 "Ever since the invention of the motorized torpedo, the maritime power balance of the world has been greatly shaken. This little revolution has most benefited smaller nations such as ourselves, with mere boats being able to sink the largest capital ships. While the advantage has slowly waned with improvements in underwater protection, the torpedo is still a lethal weapon that we should continue to hone."
 SIC_study_capital_ships:0 "Studying Modern Capital Ship Design"
 SIC_study_capital_ships_desc:0 "Our naval doctrine has never truly had a place for large capital ship design. Larger ships were always deemed too unwieldy and slow, and most importantly too expensive when the objective was deterrence and fending off coastal raids. However, with the rising continental tension, mere deterrence may not suffice, there is now an incentive to study and begin such ships, beginning with modified Imperial examples."
 SIC_our_own_capital_ship:0 "Our Own Capital Ship"
 SIC_our_own_capital_ship_desc:0 "Our studies have turned up positive. More recent technological developments have proven that a large, fast, well armed, reasonably well armored, and reasonably priced capital ship is possible, and our shipyards are ready to construct a prototype."
 SIC_fast_battleship_committee:0 "The Fast Battleship Committee"
 SIC_fast_battleship_committee_desc:0 "Our research into capital ship design has grown beyond a mere project to a very important section of the Armada Nacional. The admiralty has recommended we formalize this group into a proper committee to better organize these efforts going into the future."
 SIC_modernize_command_structure:0 "Modernize the Command Structure"
 SIC_modernize_command_structure_desc:0 "A newly unified navy also needs massive restructuring in the command structure. Consolidating all of the separate city commands into a single national structure will take a considerable amount of time, but we will reap the benefits of centralized coordination."
 SIC_skirmish_theory:0 "Skirmish Theory"
 SIC_skirmish_theory_desc:0 "Traditionally, we have tried to never engage enemy fleets in an equal pitched battle, for our main enemies have always had greater manpower reserves and industrial capacity to absorb losses. As such we’ve always attempted to skirmish and dictate the terms of battle with our fleet’s speed, and we can hone this doctrine by adding blending traditional battlefleet strategy into ours."
 SIC_carrier_theory:0 "Carrier Theory"
 SIC_carrier_theory_desc:0 "Proponents from our fledgling mechanized air corps have suggested and steadily pushed the idea of a floating airfield ship, delivering rounds not by gunpowder and rifled barrels, but by piloted aircraft instead. It is not an entirely new idea, as both the Empire and Equestria have experimented with such aircraft carriers, they may prove to be a dominant naval weapon if we have the capacity to support them."
 SIC_midoria_naval_academy:0 "Founding the National Naval Academy"
 SIC_midoria_naval_academy_desc:0 "Now that we have consolidated our command structure, it’s time to consolidate our officer training program. In line with much of our centralization restructuring, the Midoria Naval Academy will be designated and expanded for this purpose."
 SIC_next_generation_officers:0 "A New Generation of Officers"

 SIC_found_air_corps_desc:0 "Griffons have always had winged regiments within their militaries, but the advent of powered flight has propelled the air into a theater of war far vaster than ever realized before. We must keep the pace by establishing a mechanized air corps if we wish to keep the skies as free as our land and sea."
 SIC_dusters_to_fighters:0 "From Dusters to Fighters"
 SIC_dusters_to_fighters_desc:0 "A small group of our inland farming communes have purchased high performance aircraft for spreading seeds, fertilizer, and pesticides across their fields with remarkable speed. We should purchase some examples of these aircraft for modification into our first fighters."
 SIC_first_bomber:0 "Our First Bomber"
 SIC_first_bomber_desc:0 "Eyewitnesses from our troops during our occupation of the Jojo Islands of Wingbardian aircraft bombarding Falcorian positions during their 985 ALB war have proven that aerial bombing could be a powerful tactic in the near future. Modifying a civilian transport aircraft will be a good start for our own bombers."
 SIC_arahno_school:0 "Establishing the Arahno Air School"
 SIC_arahno_school_desc:0 "Establishing a new air school in northern Leve province provides a number of benefits: all types of regions for new pilots to fly over within the nation, a useful northern airbase, and a place to develop new mechanized air doctrine."
 SIC_radio_detection:0 "Developing Radio Detection"
 SIC_radio_detection_desc:0 "As radio towers continue to be erected across the federation, our naval engineers have tinkered with the novel idea of detecting objects through radio signal pulses. Such experimental devices have been mounted both on civilian and naval ships as early collision warning systems, and our aviation engineers believe this could be useful for detecting aircraft."
 SIC_strafing_talent:0 "Natural Strafing Talent"
 SIC_strafing_talent_desc:0 "Being the natural brethren of those low flying seabirds who skim the ocean surface and even dive underwater for fish, our pilots have a natural grasp of low flying air attacks. We should capitalize on this natural gift and develop our close air support tactics."
 SIC_adapting_patrols:0 "Adapting the Coastal Patrol"
 SIC_adapting_patrols_desc:0 "Our city militias have historically been charged with the task to provide coastal security in the form of patrol groups of griffons who fly along the shoreline, keeping an eye out for suspicious goings-on. Such experience could be adapted to suit our new air corps as coastal defense against enemy naval vessels."
 SIC_support_doctrine:0 "Close Support Doctrine"
 SIC_support_doctrine_desc:0 "Our pilots' natural talents have been honed into true battle strategies. From this point on, they only need to be honed in battle and tempered through combat experience."
 SIC_sea_hawkeyes:0 "The Seahawkeyes"
 SIC_sea_hawkeyes_desc:0 "The title of a Sea Hawkeye was one only reserved for the finest patrolgriffs, marines, and sailors with astounding senses and combat prowess. But now it graces our best naval air combat squadrons, taking on a far more important role than ever before, taking mechanized airpower to combat our enemies on the high seas."
 SIC_barnstormer_squadron:0 "The Barnstormer Squadron"
 SIC_barnstormer_squadron_desc:0 "Taking the name from skilled and daring crack stunt pilots, the Barnstormer Squadron makes up of our finest fighter pilots, making use of risky and unorthodox tactics as their namesake implies."
 SIC_floating_airfield:0 "A Floating Airfield"
 SIC_floating_airfield_desc:0 "Collaborating with our younger naval officers, our aviation staff have pushed the idea of deploying combat squadrons from specially designed ships that act essentially as floating mobile airfields. The ability to project airpower in such a way is undoubtably a very powerful one, and is also being explored by foreign powers. Resources permitting, we should experiment with adapting aircraft and ships to such a task."

 SIC_peasant_republic_desc:0 "Standing for 'Los Grifos y Parroquias de Sicameon', or more simply defined as Sicameonese federalism, this abbreviation simply refers to our uniquely democratic and egalitarian style of governance in contrast to our largely monarchist neighbors. We have maintained these republican traditions first laid out by the Five Founding Cities for over 700 years, longer than even the existence of the Empire, and we have no intention of giving them up now."
 SIC_church_schools:0 "Sycaecian Temple Schooling"
 SIC_church_schools_desc:0 "Public schooling has historically been an alien concept in Griffonia, and the lack of it can easily be seen in the illiterate masses of the former Imperial nations. This has not been the case in Sicameon, where we have taught our youth to read, write, and count within Her holy temples for centuries, however it is becoming apparent that this system is becoming dated, and debates have sprung up over the importance of religious teachings in an increasingly scientific world."
 SIC_armed_merchant_marine:0 "Armed Merchant Marine"
 SIC_armed_merchant_marine_desc:0 "While many other nations have either made armed merchant ships illegal or otherwise fall out of favor, we have maintained the old traditions of the East Hindiagriff. While they are certainly no longer a match for modern battlefleets, they are enough to ward off would be pirates and disguised raiders, and provide a ready base of partially trained sailors for our navy."

 SIC_militia_dependence_desc:0 "Our military has traditionally been based on a mandatory levy system on the part of the parishes, groups of minutegriffs ready to defend their homes, but always with a rather loose connection to national authority as mandated by our Federal Charter. As a result we have rarely had a true standing military other than at the actual outbreak of war or during times of tension, which in this new age of warfare greatly limits our ability to effectively defend against a built up and rapidly advancing invader."
 SIC_constitutionalized_decentralization:0 "Constitutionalized Decentralization"
 SIC_constitutionalized_decentralization_desc:0 "From the earliest notions of a unified Sicameon to the signing of the original Federal Charter of 773, there has always been a fear that a strong central authority would be able to overtake our republic from within, and so through a series of clauses the federal government was severely limited and instead vested in the parishes. So far this has worked soundly for us, and only Grover II's invasion in 799 has prompted increases in federal power. But with the once again growing ambitions in our neighbors, there are new concerns that such a weak authority may not be responsive enough to counter modern threats."

 sicameon.1.t:0 "The Tomato Festival"
 sicameon.1.d:0 "Today, Griffons from all over the Federation have converged on the town of Bahia de Tridente for the annual tomato festival. While, of course, dishes containing tomatoes are prepared and served, the big highlight of the festival is always the Tomato Fight at the last day. In the days leading up to the fight, crates of tomatoes are stocked in homes, and young fledglings fly around trying to spot the best vantage points. And then, at the stroke of noon, the city devolves into chaos, as a catapult sends a load of tomatoes flying. Never into a window somehow, but always hitting griffons.\n\nThen, the teams usually make their entrance. They are not as much teams as they are just loose groups of friends working together, but they’re teams anyway. Tomatoes are grabbed from wherever possible and wanton thrown around as the town descends into chaos. Fun chaos that is.\n\nAs the evening passes by, more and more griffons take part in the battle. Sometimes they use cold tomato sauce, otherwise, the leftover juice will have to do as another form of sour-flavoured weapon, while the prepared crates are emptied, and then replaced with other crates. \n\nThen, it all calms down after the horn sounds and no more tomatoes are delivered into the town. The last few in talon are thrown, but soon, there are only the red griffons and the inch-deep layer of tomatoes all over the town. Cleanup is usually done by flooding the town temporarily\n\nGoggles, are of course, mandatory to avoid any eye damage"
 sicameon.1.a:0 "Sense? What fun is there in making sense."
 sicameon.2.t:0 "Federation Day"
 sicameon.2.d:0 "Today, Griffons all over the Parishes celebrate the Federation and its history, especially those places that saw battles against the Empire 250 years ago. Recruits for the militias are also inducted into their units on this day. The oath they take vary, but it mostly goes like this:\n\nWe united against the Empire, together under one banner. And yet, we never forgot from where we came. We came from the few, not from the many. We have carried the standard of freedom even when it seemed easier to bend the knee to the hated Emperor. We proclaim this sacred oath. "We will not waver in the face of oppression. We shall not fall before other oppressors, and we shall resist all attempts to infringe on our liberty."\n\nWhen the recruits have taken the oath, most griffons stay for the large celebrations that every town has planned. Food, drink, and dancing long into the night and right until the next morning when the last few drunken griffons fly/stumble home to sleep out the wine.\n\nOh yeah, and there’s fireworks too. Lots and lots of fireworks."

 sicameon.10.t:0 "The Queruscos Conference"
 sicameon.10.d:0 "As the tribunes and parrators arrive in Queruscos for the Conclave, most have already spent their time aligning with one of two broad factions. Unfortunately, the gathering turned out to be deadlocked with the two large factions bickering over the sacrifice of liberties granted in the constitution in favor of letting the government run more smoothly and centralized. \n\nOne is the Midoria Plan, spearheaded by the urban tribunes. They say that we fallen too far behind and that our current constitution is to blame. They argue for sweeping amendments to the constitution to empower the central government in Midoria to preserve Sicameon at all. The Tribune of Midoria, Plumar has been spotted around town pushing his plan hard, holding speeches in the streets and halls.\n\nHowever, on the other talon is the rural tribunes and most of the parrators is the Leve Plan that rather than the sweeping amendments proposed in the Midoria Plan. Rather they argue a gradual empowerment of Midoria to preserve the current balance of power in the nation between parish and Midoria. Griffons in the city has seen numerous parrators lobbying tribunes to vote their way\n\nHowever, deadlocked as it was, as the days went on, more and more tribunes switched their votes towards one of the plans, and as the Conclave closed, the closing speech remarked what plan had won out."
 sicameon.10.a:0 "The Midoria plan is necessary for our survival."

 sicameon.11.d:0 "Disaster on Scarlet island today! As huge amounts of the island's coast has been completely devistated by a massive tsunami coming from the south. Our nation is reeling as the government scrambles for emergency funds to bring recovery to the people. And while this is all happening, and interesting offer has come to us. Both the communists and the... controversial Don Espadarte have offered funds to assist in the repairs. While this would lift a huge economic burden off of the naiton, it would also give them serious credibility that we would rather them not have."
 sicameon.11.a:0 "We do not need their aid..."
 sicameon.11.b:0 "Help is always appreciated!"
 sicameon.12.t:0 "Election Campaigning Begins"
 sicameon.12.d:0 "With the writs for the election having dropped, tribunes, parrators and candidates looking to topple the former alike have rushed to their home parish to campaign. As always, one of the highlights of the campaign is a big team debate in Queruscos, this time between the Moderates and Radicals in the PIS, spearheaded by their respective leaders, Alexis de Sicameon and Remige Plumar, for the Moderates and Radicals, respectively. \n\nThe debate itself has shown itself to be a momentous one, with accusations of flip-flopping abound and various props being carried in (but never thrown around) to make their point. Remige Plumar in particular brought in a giant billboard to underline his points. In any case, with the moderates countering with skillful arguments, most spectators agreed that there still was one definitive victor when the debate ended and everygriff went home, which was that..."
 sicameon.12.a:0 "The moderates presented better arguments."
 sicameon.12.b:0 "The radicals convinced the populace with their fervour!"
 sicameon.13.t:0 "The Unexpected Candidate"
 sicameon.13.d:0 "Despite the actual election being most pro-forma with the Primary elections between the Moderates and Radicals being the more exciting part of the elections. However, it seems as though the elections this year will be stranger than first thought. The Free Corsairs, led by Don Espadarte have today declared their intention to stand in several parishes all over the Federation. However, he is widely considered to be one of the most extreme candidates, and is unlikely to attract support from much of the population. He is, contrary to all logic, going full out, holding speeches all over the Federation."
 sicameon.13.a:0 "Don't listen to that scoundrel!"
 sicameon.13.b:0 "He sure is a charming fellow..."
 sicameon.14.t:0 "A Radical Argument"
 sicameon.14.d:0 "Don Espadarte, despite the very, very slim chance of victory in the Federal Election has still gone all out, holding stump speeches and flooding parish after parish in with the same obnoxious flyers. Lately, he, in one of his speeches in Escarlata, has put forth some very...radical arguments for what the Parishes should do in the future. \n\nThese arguments have caused quite the furor in the established political sphere, if nothing else due to the language deployed and the implications in the plans. But the populace responded to his arguments, but how?"
 sicameon.14.a:0 "Don knows what's best for the people!"
 sicameon.14.b:0 "That rat is a liar and a thief!"
 sicameon.15.t:0 "Federal Elections"
 sicameon.15.d:0 "With the campaigning over, after hundreds of stump speeches, doorknocking and obnoxious flyers, the griffons all over the parishes has now gone to the polls to have their say in the governing of our Federation. The last polling numbers has put the PIS at a comfortable supermajority, but, of course, the Moderates and Radicals are standing against each other in several places. In any case, the Free Corsairs are not expected to win seats in any but the most "out-there" parishes. \n\nHowever, the Corsairs are not expected to win any sort of base, or even hold the balance of power in the Tribunes or amongst the Parrators. In any case, the elections will soon be over, as the ballot boxes are opened and counted. First results have shown PIS, Moderate and Radical taking parish after parish, but..."
 sicameon.15.a:0 "The moderates are re-elected!"
 sicameon.15.b:0 "The radicals rise at last!"
 sicameon.15.c:0 "Perhaps we can "adjust" the results a little..."
 sicameon.16.t:0 "The Jojo Question"
 sicameon.16.d:0 "During the brutal Wingbardy-Falcor War of 985-989, there was major concern over the security of our waters due to the prompt sinking of the Falcor Navy in the opening stages of the conflict, allowing Wingbardy to freely approach Falcorian waters which are shared with us. This came to a head over the tiny islands of Jo and Jo, which are home to a considerable population of Sicameonese descent and have been contested between us and Falcor over the years. At the behest of a local outcry for our intervention and the approaching threat of the Wingbardian Navy, the nearby Scarlet and Keowen militias occupied the Armada Nacional was positioned strategically to deter any attempt at a bombardment or a landing on Jojo, and after the war a local referendum was held to determine whether they would secede and join our federation, or rejoin the Falcor Principality. The vote weighed heavily in our favor and we annexed the small island chain by the will of the people there, and the devastated Falcorian military could do little to oppose the motion.\nWhile we maintain the claim to be legitimately sovereign over the territory, the Falcorian monarchy clearly does not recognize this claim even if they have not done much to contest it, and our relations with the Principality have been strained ever since.\n\nSome of our diplomats are now proposing something rather radical, if we ever wish to earn Falcor's trust and friendship. We could cede them the islands as a gift. While many protested this idea, many others saw that it might be the only option if we wish to mend our fences."
 sicameon.16.a:0 "We shall grant them Jojo as a gift."
 sicameon.16.b:0 "Jojo is ours, let us prepare the dignitaries."
 sicameon.17.t:0 "An Unexpected Gift"
 sicameon.17.d:0 "During the Wingbardy-Falcor War, the Parishes occupied the Jojo Islands for what they claimed "for their own sovereign protection". Since then, those same islands have been a continuous and never-ending source of dispute between Matton and Midoria, with thinly-veiled threats and requests being exchanged near-daily. However, it seems that this dispute has suddenly come to a happy end as a delegation arrived today in [Root.capital.GetName] with a decree from [From.GetNameDef]  that they have chosen to relinquish all claims on the Jojo Islands, and that they will be ceded to us as soon as the last few decrees to officially letting go of the islands have been completed\n\nNeedless to say, this is a most pleasant surprise."
 sicameon.17.a:0 "Oh... thank you!"
 sicameon.18.t:0 "Preparing A Delegation To Falcor"
 sicameon.18.d:0 "If we are choosing to let the Jojo Question lie, the delegation has already been prepared, and they are still looking for instructions for their goals in Matton. This time, the Foreign Service has put a number of options on the table that seems realistic enough for us to pursue.\n\nThe first option, favoured by some of the Tribunes is pursuing an alliance with the Principality. While this would bind us towards them in some ways, one of our largest, indeed the largest border we have is with the Principality and securing an alliance would secure us from attack from the western border, as well as on the Jojo Islands and Scarlet\n\nThe second option is a bit less restrictive and is the non-aggression pact. This would not drag us into any wars that the Principality could be involved in whatsoever, but if the Principality was to fall, we could risk a large aggressive presence on our western border. On the other talon, this might be a good idea if we are going to war to the east\n\nThe third option is arguably the most aggressive and involves a direct demand. Namely, that the Principality relinquish their claim on the Jojo Islands. This could, however backfire, and lead to a total breakdown in relations between our two nations. But, if accepted would bring an end to the disputes that the Jojo Islands are in, and in a favorable way to us. \n\nLastly, we don’t have to present them with anything substantial. Rather, the delegation can be ordered to schmooze them and present with wines and other gifts to get them to offer something. Of course, they can just take it for generosity at its face value and leave it there. However, as the Jojo Islands are bound to come up in discussion, the plan calls for the delegation to lightly pressure the court in Falcor to recognize our rule over the islands."
 sicameon.18.a:0 "We should seek an alliance!"
 sicameon.18.b:0 "We must promise to never attack each other."
 sicameon.18.c:0 "Demand them to recognize Jojo as part of Sicameon!"
 sicameon.18.e:0 "We just wanted to give them a gift. Nothing else."
 sicameon.19.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] Desires An Alliance"
 sicameon.19.d:0 "We have today received a delegation from Sicameon. The decree they are bearing with them asks for an alliance, in which we would pledge to follow them into any wars, while they would do the same. This is arguably a very tricky question, as it will mean that if they were to be involved in a war, against, say the Kingdom of Wingbardy, we would be required to follow them. On the other talon, if we were to be involved in the same, we could count on their aid. \n\nThe delegation is waiting, what shall be our answer?"
 sicameon.19.a:0 "We are stronger together!"
 sicameon.19.b:0 "Begone, peasant filth!"
 sicameon.20.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] Accepted"
 sicameon.20.d:0 "Good news everyone! Our delegation has returned with a signed decree from [From.GetNameDef] stating that they will join us in any further military conflict, aggressive or defensive. This marks a significant step forward in our relations"
 sicameon.20.a:0 "We are stronger together!"
 sicameon.21.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] Refused"
 sicameon.21.d:0 "Terrible news! Our delegation to [From.GetNameDef] got the cold shoulder from them. Despite their pleas, skills or diplomatic guile, the alliance proposal is now effectively dead in the water. "
 sicameon.21.a:0 "Curses!"
 sicameon.22.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] Seeks Non-Aggression Pact"
 sicameon.22.d:0 "Today, we received something out of the ordinary from the Parishes of Sicameon. A petition, to be more precise. It asks, in the most diplomatic language they could muster, for a non-aggression pact, for both parties to not take armed action against each other and for this to continue for an undetermined time to be made finite by a later summit.\n\nOf course, this can and will bind us in foreign affairs. Although we can probably find a way to get out of this pact, it will come with consequences. "
 sicameon.22.a:0 "Sure, we had no plans to attack them anyways."
 sicameon.22.b:0 "Tell them we have other plans for their pitiful "nation"."
 sicameon.22.c:0 "Of course... but only if you pay tribute."
 sicameon.23.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] Accepted"
 sicameon.23.d:0 "There are good news today from the Foreign Service. Our delegation has returned from [From.GetNameDef] with the news that they have accepted and ratified our proposal for a non-aggression pact. This is excellent news for us."
 sicameon.23.a:0 "Peace in our time."
 sicameon.24.t:0 "A Demand From Midoria"
 sicameon.24.d:0 "Today, something came out of Sicameon other than the usual news about tomatoes flying around or political deadlock, rather, they have arrived demanding that we relinquish our claim on the Jojo Islands! This is arguably an overt threat, but with the current balance of power in South Griffonia, they might be able, damnable as it is, to get away with doing this. What should we answer?"
 sicameon.24.a:0 "Very well, the islands wanted it anyways..."
 sicameon.24.b:0 "Jojo islands belong to us!"
 sicameon.25.t:0 "Jojo Claim Recognized As Legitimate"
 sicameon.25.d:0 "For a long time, we have possessed the Jojo Islands, which have been the center of a somewhat bizarre adventure in diplomacy. Not too long ago, we demanded that Falcor relinquish their claim on those same islands as per the wishes of the inhabitants. And they have agreed to our demands, signing the Treaty of Queruscos, relinquishing their claim to the islands in perpetuity\n\nNeedless to say, our diplomatic corps are partying."

This has run into difficulties in Falcor, as they have chosen to reassert their own claim on them as per 984 borders. This has caused negotiations as a whole to break down as our delegation have with this demand insulted Falcorians so much that they have been kicked out."
 sicameon.26.a:0 "Seems like Jojo's Bizarre Situation will go on."
 sicameon.27.t:0 "Sicameon's Generosity"
 sicameon.27.d:0 "The Sicameonese Delegation arrived today, with the whole diplomatic corps bracing for another demand for Jojo to be recognized as part of Sicameon. Instead, they came bearing gifts. The gifts have been most appreciated, both for being gifts, but also as a break from the previous barrage of requests. The whole of the bureaucratic apparatus is opening a cold one to not being forced to deal with another demand. This does still leave the question of what the road forward with this delegation should be. This need not to be a especially substantial reply. Not taking any action is still an action, after all."
 sicameon.27.a:0 "They seem like good friends."
 sicameon.27.b:0 "We no longer have a reason to attack them."
 sicameon.27.c:0 "They can keep the islands. They deserve them."
 sicameon.27.e:0 "Guess we'll keep them, then."
 sicameon.28.t:0 "A Question Of Courage"
 sicameon.28.d:0 "With the raids sent by Blackrock becoming more and more troublesome for our northern population, the tribunes and parrators from these parishes have been more and more vocal about doing something about it. With the militias being busy elsewhere, the topic of a delegation to Murkbeak has been brought up instead. However, Blackrock is unlikely to take any lackeys seriously. Thus, if we are to have a even a small chance of this succeeding, the Dux, [Root.GetLeader] will have to lead them. "
 sicameon.28.a:0 "The Dux shall lead the delegates!"
 sicameon.28.b:0 "No, that is an absurd idea..."
 sicameon.29.t:0 "The Dux Of Sicameon Visits Murkbeak"
 sicameon.29.d:0 "A most peculiar sight has turned up today at the court. The Dux of Sicameon himself has turned up at the head of an entourage, ready to negotiate for a treaty to stop the raids. This presents an excellent opportunity to capture the Dux and demand a ransom for his return. On the other claw, we could do with an image that isn’t all plunder, even if that is what we always want."
 sicameon.29.a:0 "Capture the naïve fool! His ransom must be great indeed..."
 sicameon.29.b:0 "Fine, let us do this negotiating thing."
 sicameon.30.t:0 "Our Leader Imprisoned"
 sicameon.30.d:0 "Catastrophe! When the Dux was leading the delegates, he walked right into a trap set by Blackrock! He was taken captive along with our entire delegation, and they are currently rotting in a humid dungeon below Murkbeak. The Bandit Queen has already sent a demand for a ransom if we want our Dux back in one piece, otherwise she’ll be forced to find other measures to send our leader back. And we may not necessarily like them one bit"
 sicameon.30.a:0 "We must rescue him at once!"
 sicameon.30.b:0 "Let's pay his ransom before he gets hurt."
 sicameon.31.t:0 "Sicameon Pays The Ransom"
 sicameon.31.d:0 "Those fools in Sicameon have wisely decided that the life of their Dux was worth more than mere money, and have paid the ransom demanded. A bag of coins was the first, with a column of various dignitaries following after with their own bags of coins in exchange for them letting their leader go. We are of course square dealers and since they have paid up, we have released him. After all, we might risk another group refusing to pay next time."
 sicameon.31.a:0 "We're in the money!"
 sicameon.32.t:0 "Preparing For A Dangerous Journey"
 sicameon.32.d:0 "With Murkbeak having responded favorably to our overtures, we now need to figure out what to do, now that our line of communications has been opened. A few different options have been on the table. Unfortunately, the diplomatic division that worked out these proposals had/ some difficulties grasping the fact that the government in Murkbeak may or may not be hostile and that the proposals therefore might be unrealistic to actually go ahead with.\n\nNevertheless, they came up with two options, and quoting:\n1. Signing a non-aggression pact to avoid conflict in the future. In the case of the Bandit Queen reigning from Murbeak, this might be preferable to avoid raids and war in the future.\n2. A Guarantee of independence based off the Golden Curtain idea to make sure that if we are dragged into war, that the war will not devastate our own lands but rather the lands of Murkbeak. This would only be possible under a non-bandit government"

 sicameon.33.d:0 "After we sent the offer of a non-aggression pact to Blackrock, we have gotten news back from them, in the form of a counteroffer. They are demanding that "we pay for the ‘privilege’ of being spared". While they are still agreeing to the non-aggression pact in theory, we would need to continuously pay them to keep them from attacking us. "
 sicameon.33.a:0 "Forget about it!"
 sicameon.33.b:0 "This may cost us, but it will save many lives."
 sicameon.34.t:0 "Sicameon Refuses To Pay Tribute"
 sicameon.34.d:0 "Unfortunately, the fools in Sicameon have refused our most generous offer of protection from raids. A shame, but what can you do against stupidity? Our raiding parties on the other claw is downright ecstatic about this, with them already polishing their weapons for later"
 sicameon.34.a:0 "A shame. Prepare the raiders!"
 sicameon.35.t:0 "Sicameon Agrees To Pay Tribute"
 sicameon.35.d:0 "Good news everyone! The Sicameonese have decided to pay up for protection. The fact that we are behind the raids in their territory nonwithstanding, we will now receive a handsome dividend from them every so often that should relieve the pressure on our own economy. Economy being quite a wide topic."

 sicameon.36.t:0 "Sicameon Guarantees Our Freedom"
 sicameon.36.d:0 "In a show of goodwill, the Sicameonese have guaranteed our independence from any foreign aggression, be it from Prywhen or from the Empire.

 sicameon.37.t:0 "The Partioning Of Blackhollow"
 sicameon.37.d:0 "Murkbeak burns and Blackhollow lies before us. With the lands under our complete control, we stand now at a crossroads. The lands that we control now are de jure part of Griffonstone and rightfully, they should return to them. However, there are concerns that we may just end up fighting here again if another power was to swoop in. As such, another proposal has been put on the table to have the lands be reorganized under a puppet, nominally independent but with the leadership knowing where they get their marching orders from. In any case, it has already been decided to transfer the minotaur-claimed land to them, as a symbol of our friendship."
 sicameon.37.a:0 "We must create a buffer state."

 sicameon.38.t:0 "Sicameon Grants Us Land"
 sicameon.38.d:0 "Many years have passed since we lost the lands which Sicameon has now graciously granted us. We have been following their conflict with the previous owners who had taken them from us with a lot of interest, as it may finally be the time to strike when they have exhausted each other. This has proven not to be necessary today as a diplomat has arrived here with a letter. It reads:\n\n The Dux of Sicameon sends their greetings to [Root.GetNameDef]. Owing to your long history of owning the lands we recently acquired, the Federated Parishes of Sicameon have decided to vacate all garrisons from the territory and formally cede them to your control.\n\nThis has obviously been a pleasant surprise."
 sicameon.38.a:0 "Maybe those peasants aren't so bad..."
 sicameon.39.t:0 "The Question Of Cyanolisia"
 sicameon.39.d:0 "After a prolonged struggle, the lands which once belonged to the tyrannical County of Cyanolisia have now been truly liberated by our brave troops. Yet integrating it all into our nation is out of the question. Much of the population consists of minotaurs who yearn to rejoin their homeland. We have therefore decided, in order to prevent any unrest and to improve our relations with the bovines, to cede it all to Asterion, the rightful owners."
 sicameon.39.a:0 "May their people rejoice."
 sicameon.40.t:0 "Mission Accomplished"
 sicameon.40.d:0 "Cyanolisia has been liberated. The oppressors that drove our friends from this place lie before us, defeated. The question has sometimes been raised; What to do with Cyanolisia? And the answer is clear: The minotaurs have been dreaming of their day where they could retake their lands, and today, as a symbol of our friendship we are giving them the lands that are theirs and always have been. No more shall they toil under a foreign oppressor."
 sicameon.40.a:0 "The minotaurs are free at last!"
 sicameon.41.t:0 "Preparing A Delegation To Wingbardy"
 sicameon.41.d:0 "As we look outside of our own borders for protection, one of the names mentioned in passing was the Kingdom of Wingbardy. Not far from our own lands, in fact, close enough that you can spot it from Jojo, it is a formidable power in its own right and leads the Karthinian Pact. In fact, Wingbardy has turned out to be a so popular name amongst the government that a delegation is being prepped for a visit to the Kingdom. While there is no certainty about an acceptance of our petitions to them, we still need to determine exactly what we should write in it.\n\nOption #1, a mutual guarantee of independence. This is arguably the option to take if anyone but Wingbardy are looking to attack us in the future, which will bring in the Karthinian Pact on our side in a future war with, for example, the Griffon Liberation Army or Falcor. However, on the other talon, if Wingbardy is attacked, we would be forced to join or look like backstabbing opportunists.\n\nOf course, there’s another option available, a non-aggression pact. If Wingbardy is looking to expand towards us, we should seek a non-aggression pact with them, to protect ourselves, if nothing else. But, can a Wingbardy that is already on an expansionist route really be stopped by a treaty? \n\nIn any case, the final decision has been left to the government instead of the bureaucracy. A decision must be taken."
 sicameon.41.a:0 "Ask for a mutual guarantee."
 sicameon.41.b:0 "Ask for a mutual pact of peace."
 sicameon.42.t:0 "Sicameon Proposes A Mutual Guarantee"
 sicameon.42.d:0 "A petition arrived from the Parishes of Sicameon today, with an offer. A mutual guarantee of our independence from outside powers. While it would prevent us, like in an non-aggression pact from using our full range of tools outside of our borders, it could shore up our flanks against an invasion, if one such should happen.\n\nWe should note, however that we can probably find a way later to get out of this...just don’t take too much care of our reputation abroad."
 sicameon.42.a:0 "We accept."

 sicameon.44.d:0 "Joyous day! Somehow, our Sicameonese friends across the channel have done us yet another a great service to restore our republic, this time as if by magic presenting ancient national artifacts thought long lost at the embassy today. Among the mythic articles are the original colonial charter as drafted by Aster and his council, the diary of Aster himself, an ancient sculpture of a minotaur shielding a flame with their body from the old homeland, among many other priceless pieces. \n\nThese were long thought to be lost to myth, when our ancient republic fell into tyranny. The legend goes that the young minotaur lady Dorothea Maimonides, good friend to the final leader of the old republic, retrieved all of these treasures and escaped upriver by boat, hauled them by cart past Lillai, and them smuggled them aboard a small ship to the town of Pielciudad in Sicameon. There they were taken to Midoria and locked away in a secret vault, so secret that it was eventually forgotten... until today. Truly a miracle!"

Officially, they are "tourists" and the weapons are marked as a tomato shipment to Cloudbury, but they are still here nonetheless and they are chomping at the bit to get into battle. They have expressed a wish to stay here even after the war to help build up the Republic against threats, not just those that currently threaten it, but also future threats to the life of it, foreign or domestic\n\nNeedless to say, they are a sight for sore eyes."

The Security Committee has come up with two proposals, one of which must be taken.\n\nFirst proposal: A Purge. They are a clear threat to our position, and if we do not move first, they will move against us some day. Despite the times that we shared in the past, if we do not purge them, they can and will move against us. Striking first, coordinated and making sure that they have no chance to strike back, with a "fair" trial before their righteous punishment. While it will cause domestic disturbances, Peace, after all is obtained through Power.\n\nOn the other talon, there is the option of reaching out a claw to them and working with the moderates to carry our reforms through. This will undoubtedly hamper down any attempts at going to war in the future, but it will cement our rule at home, even if we have to share some of it.

 sicameon.82.d:0 "After we stormed the bars at the harbor, we have interrogated many of the suspects that we dragged out from there. After the investigators deployed their more persuasive tactics, playing on their fates in prison while Don Espadarte would slip away with all their gains, most broke down and confessed everything. Honestly, most of the thugs in there had rather mundane and irrelevant secrets. One stole an apple when they were a fledgling, another regularly eats vegetables. However, there was one scoop amongst all of this. There was one who had arranged transport for Don Espadarte to Keowen overland. No doubt he will try to flee upriver. We must hurry!"
 sicameon.82.a:0 "We must go there at once!"
 sicameon.83.t:0 "The Result Of The Investigation"
 sicameon.83.d:0 "After carefully surveying the bars at the harbor, we have napped those that seemed the most likely to harbor sympathies for the Swordfish. Interrogation yielded only a few results, however. However, there is a problem with the results. The problem is that they completely contradict each other. \n\nThe first of the two scoundrels say that he bribed a captain to let Don Espadarte onto his boat that was to leave for somewhere unknown within the week. It would be a large investment of our resources to watch the coasts, and would likely leave us lacking elsewhere\n\nThe other has confessed that he arranged transport for Don Espadarte to Keowen. According to the investigators, it would allow him to travel upriver to Blackrock. If he reaches Blackrock, it would put us completely out of our reach. We need to make a decision quick, as we cannot reach everywhere at the same time."
 sicameon.83.a:0 "He must be sailing somewhere. Watch the coasts!"
 sicameon.83.b:0 "The trails clearly lead to Keowen!"
 sicameon.84.t:0 "The Pursuit"
 sicameon.84.d:0 "The trail has led us to Keowen where we suspect the scoundrel is hiding out before he can hitch a ride on a boat to Blackrock. However, the whole town is up in arms over the news. The rumours that he was in town were exaggerated, and the populace seems just about ready to lynch anyone that even slightly resembles the Swordfish. Problem is, we don’t have a lot of griffonpower and if we try to calm the populace, it may create the very window for the Swordfish to escape that we are trying to close by our presence."
 sicameon.84.a:0 "After him! Quickly!"
 sicameon.84.b:0 "Divert our forces!"
 sicameon.84.c:0 "We must calm the people first!"
 sicameon.85.t:0 "The Coast Is Clear"
 sicameon.85.d:0 "The days went by as the navy watched the coast for any sign of the Swordfish. And they waited\n\nAnd waited.\n\nAnd waited.\n\nNothing.\n\nThen, a message arrived. One of Don Espadarte’s compatriots had gotten a case of buyer’s remorse and turned themselves in. They told everything. How they bribed just the right people to make sure that we would be sent on a wild chase in the wrong direction, how they arranged for Don Espadarte’s transport to Keowen. Needless to say, all our forces are now converging on the city. Hopefully, he didn’t get too much of an advantage."
 sicameon.85.a:0 "To Keowen! Quickly!"
 sicameon.86.t:0 "Watching The River"
 sicameon.86.d:0 "Barges travel everyday up and down the river. A lot of them in fact. And while we can check most of them, it is nearly impossible to check them all. That would require so much griffonpower that we would leave most of the Federation defenceless. But enough about that. The river has been put on lockdown and all barges that enter the river at Keowen, or any other place will have to be checked for any sign of Don Espadarte. Griffons are also flying overhead, making sure that he doesn’t sneak or jumps onto one of the boats. And now, there is only waiting for the news to tick in from the river."
 sicameon.86.a:0 "Let's see how it goes..."
 sicameon.87.t:0 "Calming The People"
 sicameon.87.d:0 "With the townsgriffons up in arms, we had to divert a significant portion of our forces to calm the populace, in fact, so much that we had to rely on militia reserves and other irregular forces to bolster our numbers to avoiding a total breakdown in investigate services. While we finally got them under control, we may have squandered a critical advantage in our hunt for the Swordfish."
 sicameon.87.a:0 "We need to get a move on!"
 sicameon.88.t:0 "Unexpected Trouble"
 sicameon.88.d:0 "With our forces entering Keowen to keep the peace, it turned out the rumours of the town being up in arms were grossly wrong. They were grossly underestimating just how many were in the streets to find and lynch the Swordfish. Griffons had brought rope, spears and even guns into the city to find him. Of course, there are limits to what we can tolerate. No matter how despicable he is, Don Espadarte still deserves a fair trial, not a wildcat murder. \n\nWhen we entered the city, the frenzied mob saw us as Don Espadarte’s companions and attacked us! We had to call in reinforcements from not only neighboring, and more outlying parishes, but also militia and other forces that were available. Needless to say, Midoria hasn’t exactly been happy with this show, mostly due to the favors they had to use to keep this quiet. To make it all worse, there’s a chance that the Swordfish has escaped upriver in the ruckus!"
 sicameon.89.t:0 "The Swordfish Caught"
 sicameon.89.d:0 "The hours crawled past, the sun baking down on the militia and police set to search the boats. Onions, cabbages, even fish and meat daily passed by, much to the chagrin of the hungry guards. And then, something made a noise from a potato boat. A wall rumbled, bringing it down, revealing Don Espadarte. The guards were practically overjoyed to have the biggest catch of the year go into their net. Of course, the press were right on the scene where the investigators posed with their new prisoner.\n\nThe latest reports from the river say that he is being transported to Midoria where he will stand trial for more crimes than a short report usually cares to mention."
 sicameon.89.a:0 "We got him!"
 sicameon.90.t:0 "A Slippery Swordfish"
 sicameon.90.d:0 "We received an anonymous letter today. Don’t worry, there’s nothing dangerous in it, we made sure of that. Still, we think it’s best that you see it personally.\n\nTo [Root.GetLeader]\n\nDear fools\n\nI write this from my mountainous retreat in Murkbeak as a personal guest of Blackhollow themselves. It is certainly a nice life with more than a few amenities, and a lot of freedom as long as I write the occasional letter to my organization in order to support my benefactors. I do hope they are causing you a lot of problems.\n\nRegards\nDon Espadarte."
 sicameon.90.a:0 "Another reason to invade Blackhollow, then."
 sicameon.91.t:0 "A Slippery Swordfish"
 sicameon.91.d:0 "Everything had been in place, griffons had been placed everywhere up and down the river. We had focused on the river being the point where Don Espadarte would escape. So much so that we completely neglected the harbor that’s also in Keowen. In fact, today, we received an oiled swordfish in the mail, no doubt a message from Don Espadarte that he’s slipped our grasp.\n\nInvestigators piecing together shipping manifests have concluded that he is on a ship belonging to the Zebra slavers and no doubt halfway there at this point. Damn."

 sicameon.92.d:0 "The courthouse has been packed with spectators as the man that sook to destroy the light of democracy in Griffonia is led in in chains. Don Espadarte is guilty, and everygriff knows that. The trial is a mere formality, serving to read out the accusations that the Swordfish faces. Murder, theft, bribery and piracy. All with stacks of evidence larger than any one griffon. And yet, there’s still verbal fights. Fights as to what penalty he should face when he is sentenced. \n\nSome have advocated for locking him in the deepest, darkest gaol as far away from Midoria as possible and throwing away the key to show ourselves as bigger people, that we will not take lives. Other have advocated for the "Return to Sycaecia", which, while it would require us to change the laws to permit this over hanging, could certainly be done with the tribunes and parrators chomping at the bit to secure reelection.\n\nOf course, there are also some very angry griffons outside the courthouse that have offered to provide their own brand of punishment, the less details said about said punishment, the better. Officially, he would have committed suicide, and the corpse cremated and consigned to an unknown place."
 sicameon.92.a:0 "Let him rot in prison."
 sicameon.92.b:0 "We shall return him to Sycaecia."
 sicameon.92.c:0 "He deserves nothing but pain and suffering."
 sicameon.93.t:0 "Madness Behind The Bars"
 sicameon.93.d:0 "It started with the screams when he was thrown into the hole near Rocá Leon. The guards had their orders, of course, and stayed put, no matter what he screamed at them. Then, someone, and we don’t know who, threw a blade down the hole. Though, one should note, the screams got more...interesting after that. Some of the guards that aren’t in an asylum right now said that he ranted about him being a plaything for higher powers and that a whole new continent lies beyond the ocean.\n\nIn any case, he now suffers mentally. He suffers just as his countless victims did."

 sicameon.94.d:0 "The metal ‘coffin’ is specially made for the Journey to Sycaecia. Made to measure that is. The convict is usually placed into the coffin prior to the procedure and then shut in with thick bolts. The last rites for a griffon subjected to this are administered at this time before it is thrown into the sea.\n\nToday, Don Espadarte was executed this way, specifically brought back for this one-time use only. The scoundrel that had ruined so many lives, got a fitting end. Unfortunately for him, this swordfish couldn’t swim. Then again, shackling a mass of iron to anyone tends to impede most floatation attempts"

Glass bottlenecks were found at the scene, along with a chain. However, no one was at the scene when we arrived. The injuries on the body show that these were clearly self-inflicted with no one around. As such, we have concluded that the death of Don Espadarte was a death by misadventure."

In addition they are technocrats, with Redglad firmly believing technological advances especially in the field of manufacturing make true communism possible, while we care little for such idealistic dreams.\n\nWhile there is much we disagree on, we must now seek the common ground and hopefully reconcile our ideologies, and prove to the world that left unity is not a joke, but a reality."

There, an overview of our differences was presented: The Sicameonese have empowered labour unions, federalism, workplace democracy and professional soldiers, while we more closely obey the principles of Caramel Marks and Steel Stallion, having a central council and a planned economy as well as an army consisting primarily of peasant militia.\n\nA Sicameonese delegate said that at least both of us could agree that private property needed to be collectivized, only for another one to say our nationalization was not the right way to do it, and instead of the state the workers themselves should own the means of production. Some of our representatives explained that this transition period was necessary after a revolution, to maintain some degree of control and to gradually move toward socialism from a feudal, capitalist system which reigned under the rule of Brodfeld dynasty.

Our delegates said revolution and bloody, extremely brutal civil war were completely unnecessary, and that PCP members should've instead pursued a path of gradual reform, like we had done. This angered many of their delegates, who ranted about the tyrannical, despotic rule of King Kloseu de Kissau.

In return, they offer that they will protect us from threats both foreign and domestic, wherever they may be.\n\nFurthermore, they are requiring that we instill a "Liason Office" which would enjoy extraterritoriality in our nation to "assist law enforcement".

Their leader, [MIT.GetLeader], spent many years in Stalliongrad and was thus influenced by their ideology of council communism. While democratic, it is far more hierarchical than our own model, and has more central economic planning.\n\nThese differences mean that we don't have as much in common as we could hope. Nevertheless, the minotaurs are our traditional allies, and we should seek closer relations with them despite our differences."

They recently gained power in their home country via elections, similarly to us, but follow a very different ideology of Sicameonese syndicalism. They have no central economic planning, and have a very horizontal structure of government in contrast to ours. Their foreign policy is aggressive and much of the country is preparing for conflict, which is a stark contrast to the peaceful Sicameon of old whose militia was content in guarding their border.\n\nDespite our differences, they now seek to re-establish close relations between our two countries.

Key member Donata Piumarossa - a former teacher of agent Tabano -  will serve as his contact. Preliminary reports indicate that the wingbardian communists have gathered in the rural region to escape increased repression in the urban centers. Despite repeated failures, the wingbardian communist movement remains impervious to international cooperation. The primary objective of current leadership appears to be insurgency at all costs. Joint analysis with military advisors indicates that any plans.\n\nAgent Tabano’s mission is to infiltrate the movement discredit the current leadership, gain their trust, sabotage any attempts of insurgency and redirect volunteers, equipment and information back to Sicameon for more efficient use."

He describes the plan’s objectives as to showcase the current government's inability to electrify the region and demonstrate the need for a revolution. The power plant was to be destroyed by explosives timed with the inauguration, possibly killing representatives from Karthin in the attempt.\n\nAgent Tabano successfully stopped the operation. He rigged the explosives before the operation begun, causing them to detonate during a countryside transport. Two members of the underground died in the explosion of the car. Local authorities dispatched police to the incident and seem to have attracted some attention to the region but far less than expected should the explosion have succeeded. Consequences are significant for the movement as it had only access to a limited amount of explosives.

He attempted to sabotage the explosives but was intercepted by a leadership member who engaged in a conversation with him. Tabano was unable to extract himself from it and answered to protect his cover. The operation was however ultimately only a limited success. The explosives were placed by inexperienced members and detonated early. The plant was destroyed and the attack killed three workers  before any officials involved in the inauguration arrived on the site. The local authorities quickly blamed the communists for an "act of terrorism" and called for reinforcement from Karthin. Civilian support for communism seems to have dwindled as a result.

The second faction, led by the current leadership, argued for the continuation of the insurgency plan, convinced of widespread popular support and dissatisfaction with the current wingbardian regime. Despite agent Tabano’s action, the insurgent faction still maintains control over the movement.\n\nThe Grezzo authorities have concluded the investigation in the exploded truck and accurately identified it as part of the communist underground, notably based on identification of the drivers’ bodies. In response, they have begun a campaign denouncing communist terrorism in the region.\n\nIn an effort to push back against the authorities’ narrative, the insurgent faction of the movement has decided to organize an attack on the Sale Mattutino newspaper headquarters. The plan was to seize the press at night, print a pro-revolutionary edition and call the population to revolt.

The fire spread quickly, forcing the local fire brigade to intervene. The press was badly damaged, rendering the propaganda plan unfeasible. The authorities inaccurately concluded to another communist terrorist attack, causing increased police repression.\n\nOne of the insurgent leader disappeared soon after the fire, causing many in the underground movement to worry about a possible defection or capture.

The partisans failed to secure effectively the press and a worker managed to flee. Followed by a partisan, the worker was gunned down in the street. Witnesses were there and the partisan fled back to the press. Chaos erupted in the press as the police intervened. Some partisans fled while others decided to fight off the police. Some partisans reported that some of those who remained thought Grezzo would rise up to help them. The siege continued all night long until the police launched an assault, killing all partisans inside. The population has didn’t support the attack, presented by the authorities as an act of terrorism, and protested in the street in support of the government and against communism.\n\nThe failure has caused Donata Piumarossa to assert her authority over the disgraced insurgent faction.

Some have argued for a policy of non-agression, leaving the Cyanolisians and Asterioneses to settle their grievances without interference. A final faction, by far the least prominent, has argued not for cooperation or neutrality but rather aggression. They argue that even under socialist rule, Cyanolisia is doomed to fall into chaos and anarchy.

Of course, the chicks were at his clawtips, and he had all the pleasure he could ever want, but no griffon in Sicameon could match his brilliance. None saw the world the way he saw it, as a playground for those with the will to seize it. But the world was wider than just Sicameon. The legendary bandit queen, Blackrock, was still going strong in the mountains of her homeland.\n\nLately, the Swordfish had let his mind wander to the mountains, imagining the daring bandit as she plundered and terrorised her enemies. He truly had picked the more boring way of ruling. The griffon could not hold it any longer. He would write the queen of bandits about his admiration for her, and request an audience in her mountain hold. It was daring, perhaps insultingly bold.

Blackrock smiled as she said the name of the corsair who had stolen the elections and then bribed his way into uncontested power. The rumours of the dashing griffon who commanded a fleet of ships to terrorise the seas had intrigued her for some time. Honestly, a ship was much classier than a band of looters. She wondered what the Swordfish wanted to do with her.\n\nAs it turned out, the Don had a very direct way of conducting diplomacy. Instead of making the usual overtures of friendship and requesting closer cooperation, the swordfish expressed the desire to see Blackrock in person and... well, she was not the griffon to repeat the scandalous things he intended to do with her.\n\nIn any case, the Swordfish of Midoria had expressed his interest in swimming upstream towards her and to court the queen of bandits. It was stupidly bold and by all means the griffon deserved a big fat no for his forwardness in trying to court a queen.

 sicameon.155.t:0 "Blackrock’s Invitation"
 sicameon.155.d:0 "Don Espadarte had not been this nervous since he was a fledgling, not even when he rigged the election. He had spent way too much time in the post sorting office these days, waiting for that one letter from Blackhollow, and now, finally, it lay before him on his desk. The corsair wasn’t that pious, but now he murmured a short prayer to Sycaecia to ask for her blessing. Then, with a trembling claw, the griffon broke the seal and opened the envelope.\n\nThe Swordfish’s heart skipped a beat as he read the words the bandit queen wrote to him. She invited him and his entourage to weeks of fun in Blackhollow! Blackrock wrote that she was intrigued by him, and hoped to meet him soon. To Espadarte’s glee, Blackrock had even signed her letter with ‘The White Rose of Blackhollow’.\n\nThe corsair did not need a clearer sign that the bandit shared his feelings. He rushed out to gather his friends and his belongings to travel to Blackhollow and meet the griffon of his heart’s desire."
 sicameon.155.a:0 "To Blackhollow!"
 sicameon.156.t:0 "Romance in Ciuleşti"
 sicameon.156.d:0 "When the Swordfish and his hundred griffon strong company of colourfully dressed corsairs arrived in Murkbeak, they were greeted by Blackrock and her gang. The two groups of scoundrels would quickly mingle while Don Espadarte slowly approached the queen of Blackhollow. She extended her claw out to him, but instead of shaking it, the seagriffon bowed down to kiss it. This made the white-feathered Blackrock laugh at the flamboyant Sicameonese.\n\n"Welcome to Murkbeak, you lowborn pirate. Let’s see if your corsairs know how to plunder!" Blackrock winked and pulled the Don back up to his paws. "I want to know what you’re made of, darling!" There was a hint of playfulness in her voice, making the Don’s heart flutter in excitement and his mind wander.\n\nThe flight to the Prywhenian village of Ciuleşti was filled with drinks and merrymaking and most of the corsairs and bandits were tipsy when they reached the target of their raid. When the swarm of two hundred armed thugs descended upon the sleepy farming village in the dead of night, it was already too late for the locals. Both the Swordfish and the White Rose could not remember much of the fighting, but in minutes, most of the wooden and thatch hovels were ablaze. Later, the two leaders found themselves sitting on the edge of the village well, sharing a bottle of Skyfall whisky, as screams and laughs were filling the air around them.\n\nThe Don laughed at Blackrock, the griffon was clearly enjoying himself, "You sure know how to entertain your guests, my queen!"\n\nBlackrock took a sip of the bottle, she didn’t really know how much she had tonight, but the Don looked great in the light of flaming hovels, and he was the real target of the raid. In a commanding tone, she responded, "Glad you liked it, pirate. Now come here." Gods she was drunk, but who cared, it was time to live a little.\n\nEspadarte scooted over to her, and she quickly embraced the Don, showing him a mischievous smile in the light of the blaze. Before he knew it, Blackrock closed in, pecking the Swordfish gently on the beak, the closest the griffons could get to a kiss. And the rest of the night, the two were inseparable. Only when the sun rose and the raiders came back to Murkbeak, drunk on victory and booze, did the Swordfish and the White Rose let go of each other."
 sicameon.156.a:0 "What a lovely night!"
 sicameon.157.t:0 "A Lovely Cruise"
 sicameon.157.d:0 "After spending some time in Blackhollow, the corsairs and bandits made their way down to Sicameon, towards Queruscos, one of the country’s naval bases. There, the ‘diplomatic delegates’ did their best to hide their rowdiness in front of the rest of Sicameon, while the Don led Blackrock herself to the docks. Every soldier the two passed saluted their dux and for some of the officers, the corsair took of his hat. Blackrock sighed at the griffon’s courtesy, he didn’t seem to be himself in his own homeland, afraid to lose standing with his non-criminal subjects. She had seen the real face of the Swordfish in Murkbeak, where the stress of ruling was lifted from his shoulders. The corsair tried hard to deny his own nature, which made Blackrock feel sorry for him. Something she almost never did.\n\nWhen they reached the pier, the Swordfish’s cocky smile returned and he was his own self again, as he pointed towards a large warship docked in port, inviting his guest on board.\n\nThe ANS Península de Makomo, pride of the Sicameonese fleet, sailed out of Querescos for open seas with two heads of state on board. Don Espadarte stood on the prowl of the ship, but where his eyes would normally dart over the serene blue of the Gulf of Storms, he now looked at the White Rose he had taken with him. "So, what kind of guns do you have on this ship?" Blackrock asked, looking at the turret behind them.\n\n "It has a main battery of 280 millimetre guns, with the barrel being 35 times that size. This baby can compete with a Wingbardian battleship." The Don answered smugly, before Blackrock grabbed his claw and pointed at the turret.\n\n"You should give me a closer look at your guns, captain." The playfulness from earlier was back in her voice, which made Espadarte eagerly follow her into the gun turret. It was cramp and hot inside, and the two had to stand close to each other, which suited them just fine. The bandit queen took her time to inspect the guns, much to the delight of the ruler of Sicameon. The crew of the Heavy Cruiser, meanwhile, would not see their guests of honour until they were almost in Midoria. . ."
 sicameon.157.a:0 "A wonderful trip!"
 sicameon.158.t:0 "A Night on the Town"
 sicameon.158.d:0 "After the two arrived in Midoria, the pleasant capital of Sicameon, they waited for their friends to arrive. Then, when all the formal business of a state visit was done, it was time for the state banquet. Two-hundred of the continent’s worst criminals attended, some dressed in a mockery of chic clothing, some not even pretending to be anything more but scoundrels. The White Rose of Blackhollow had brought a lovely black dress, which accentuated her figure, while the Swordfish of Midoria donned the colourful uniform of a Sicameonese admiral, his own feather adorning the cap.\n\nThe banquet swiftly turned into an unruly feast, especially when the wine was brought in. Cuvée-du-Roy, straight from Aquileia. The wine was exquisite, but after an hour of sitting at the table, the guests had enough of the fancy setting. Espadarte, ever the courteous host, led the crowd of criminals out of the dining hall and to the harbour district. There, the crowd would crawl through pub after pub.\n\nThree establishments into their adventure, the Don had lost his cap and Blackrock’s dress was torn. They’d kiss each other again, in front of a cheering crowd of drunk corsairs and bandits. The night became a mess of blurred memories as more and more Midorians joined the two in their escapades. Everygriffon was cheering them on and the two felt on top of the world that night. Eventually, they made their way to the Grand Temple of Sycaecia.\n\nThis was where memory started failing for Blackrock and Espadarte. Blackrock recalled that the sun was about to rise just as they held claws. The Don remembered proclaiming this was the best day of his life. The two woke up in a hastily shut shrine, well past noon, with a throbbing headache and many questions.\n\n"Why are we here?" Espadarte asked as he stood up, collecting what little clothing was left inside the small room.\n\n"We had fun, Donny, that’s what happened!" Blackrock smirked and pecked the Don’s cheek. "Let’s find out!"\n\nThe two walked into the Grand Temple, where their friends were strewn around, sleeping on temple benches. A priest was sitting against the altar, head buried in his claws. The holy griffon stood up when he saw the two, sighing heavily.\n\n"Congratulations on your matrimony, your excellence," his voice was laden with sarcasm, "and thank you for giving away the temple treasury to your wife, your generosity knows no bounds." The Swordfish froze in place, looking at his new wife. The White Rose chuckled back at her husband. And when the priest pointed at the doors, both of them ran away laughing."

 sicameon.159.d:0 "A shady ship pulled into [Root.Capital.GetName] today, on board were even shadier griffons. After requesting an audience with the Board of Admirals they approached with an offer. That due to their... unorthodox change in leadership in recent times, that they were prepared to forgive all actions taken by Zebra pirates against Sicameon ships and merchants as long as we promise to never raid them again and to focus on their enemies. In exchange for this we would be guaranteed safety from the Sicameonese navy and be allowed safe (though unofficial) safe harbor in their ports.\n\nBut the lure of Sicameon loot still draws many..."

 sicameon.161.t:0 "Zebras Defiant"
 sicameon.161.d:0 "The reckless zebra pirates of the primitive east have denied our nobles request to simply take their plundering away from our ships. Such insolance proves our assumptions about them, that as long as they wish to loot our "business", we should never trust them."

 sicameon.164.t:0 "Raid Failed"
 sicameon.164.d:0 "The fleet that set out with ambition has returned in shame.

 sicameon.165.t:0 "Sicameonese Raid Repulsed!"
 sicameon.165.d:0 "Our brave and strong naval patrol recently faced off a fleet of ships waving Sicameonese flags and managed to fend them off, despite being badly outnumbered.

However, if our navy had been stronger, the corsairs wouldn't have tried attacking us in the first place."

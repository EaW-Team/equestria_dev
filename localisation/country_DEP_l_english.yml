 #Events
 deponya_advisors.0.t:0 "The Alchemist arrives"
 deponya_advisors.0.d:0 "Stealthy Serpent, also known as The Alchemist, is the newest of the King’s advisors and the most mysterious, with their body, face, and gender hidden behind heavy robes and a massive ornamental mask made of wood from the Eygsic Forest. This forest has been their home and the herbs and resources of these dangerous lands have allowed Stealthy to become a leader in potion-making and medicine throughout the kingdom.\n\nAs a member of the privy council they have constantly called for royal resources to be spent on education, alchemist endeavours, and reforming the Deponian system of governance to be better aligned with the more harmonic nations of the River Federation."
 deponya_advisors.0.a:0 "Their scholarly insight with be greatly appreciated."
 deponya_advisors.1.t:0 "The Prince Arrives"
 deponya_advisors.1.d:0 "Prince Bountiful Harvest is King Grimhoof’s eldest brother. He was passed over for the crown upon his father’s death due to the nobility finding him lacking the Right to Rule. However, the Prince holds no ill will towards his brother and has always been a trusted advisor, providing eight years of dutiful service.\n\nThe Prince is very much a conservative, believing that the old ways are what will lead Deponya through these trying times. He has used his position as advisor to solidify the status quo between the crown and the nobility while also shoring up the nation’s defenses in the face of gryphon aggression."
 deponya_advisors.1.a:0 "One must always trust the advice of family."
 deponya_advisors.2.t:0 "The Knight Arrives"
 deponya_advisors.2.d:0 "Lady Lancetrot, also known as the Knight, is the commander of the Royal Army, holding this position valiantly since well before the reign of King Grimhoof. She believes in chivalry and holds herself to it, occasionally pushing her values to the point of creating conflict between herself and the other members of the privy council. However, her reputation as a decorated war hero, her sense of humour, and the charisma of herself and her page often snubs these blossoming rivalries in the bud.\n\nAs a member of the army, she uses her voice in the council to promote a pro-military agenda, looking to funnel increasing amounts of Grimhoof’s treasury into building up defenses, increasing the scope of the military, and modernizing it, in order to ensure Deponya's security.."
 deponya_advisors.2.a:0 "A hero's welcome is in order."
 deponya_advisors.3.t:0 "The Priestess Arives"
 deponya_advisors.3.d:0 "High Priestess Radiant Glory is new to her post as head of the Deponian church. Yet, in her short tenure she has established a reputation for being warm, inviting, and kind to all she meets, may they be noblestallion or simple farmer. Her beauty is well known across the land and many ponies ache at the thought of one day becoming her suitor, even in the face of her supposed celibacy.\n\nShe has often used her charming personality and close friendship with the King to push for her rather progressive agenda. She wishes to bridge the gap between rich and poor, and stands up firmly for the rights of the peasantry."
 deponya_advisors.3.a:0 "A friend’s advice is always welcome."
 deponya_advisors.4.t_1:0 "Privy Council of 1007"
 deponya_advisors.4.t_2:0 "The Advisor Meeting: Round 2"
 deponya_advisors.4.t_3:0 "The Advisor Meeting: Round 3"
 deponya_advisors.4.t_4:0 "The Advisor Meeting: Round 4"
 deponya_advisors.4.d_1:0 "The King and his Privy Council gathered together at the royal citadel across the river from Buckbanburg. Rather than have their meeting in the openness of the central hall, the five ponies came together in the intimacy of the King’s private chambers, gathering around a large oak table.\n\nThe King has brought them together to discuss the future of Deponya. He explains that he wishes to modernize his domains. He knows such an endeavour would not be easy but asks that his advisors do their duty and help in this mission.\n\nThe first to speak is The Alchemist. They explain that the main issue plaguing Deponya is the rampant illiteracy and the utter lack of highly educated engineers, scientists, potion-makers, and alchemists. He claims that by investing into intellectual infrastructure, the ponies of Deponya can be educated and the nation can begin to address its other issues.\n\nThe Prince laughs at this, claiming that such an investment would also serve in educating the populace in the philosophies of democracy and harmony, utterly ruining the delicate balance of Deponian society. He then puts forward a plan to work with the nobility to better integrate their assets into the royal coffers and use the funds to invest in infrastructure and industry. These two pillars would surely benefit Deponya the most.\n\nThe Knight shakes her head, cracking a joke at the Prince’s expense. The Alchemist and High Priestess join in her laughter, while King Grimhoof cracks a slight smile. The Knight then goes on to demand that more gold be given to the military, lest Deponya fall to griffon raiders.\n\nThe Priestess shakes her head. No, she claims, the gold could be better spent on the poor. A modern nation is one where the entirety of society benefits from their labours and by elevating the poor they can begin to better contribute to society. Her ideas are met by wary glances.\n\nFor hours, debate rages back and forth. Until finally, the King raises a hoof, silencing the room. All eyes are upon him, ready for his decision."

 deponya_advisors.9.a:0 "Great"
 deponya_advisors.10.t:0 "The Potion-Maker’s Guild"
 deponya_advisors.10.d:0 "Within recent years, potion-making has become a rather lucrative business within Deponya, helping to alleviate some of the economic stresses of our declining agricultural exports. The recent rise in potion-making has been spearheaded by a strong demand for our potions amongst the upper-middle classes of our fellow River Federation members who believe that the natural healing properties of our elixirs and brews can trump those of modern medicine.\n\nThis rise has provided bountiful job prospects and a whole new class of amateur, and often dubiously trained, potion-makers. In order to stop their subpar brews from reaching foreign markets, and sink our reputation, King Grimhoof has established a formalized Potion-Maker’s Guild, which will control who can and cannot export potions to foreign markets. This Guild will also be chiefly responsible for conducting research on new and improve potion designs.\n\nThe first act we must take when establishing this guild, is to finance a centralized charter house for them to operate out of. The more we are willing to invest into this facility’s design, construction, equipment procurement, and staffing the better equipped the guild will be for tackling their new mission."
 deponya_advisors.10.a:0 "Give them enough funds to repurpose a merchant's house."

 deponya_spider.0.d:0 "The Eygsic Forest dominates the northern expanses of Deponya. It is a region of sparse infrastructure, few settlements, and little industry besides for a few lucrative crystal mines and lumber mills. While attempts have been made to penetrate into the forest and subjugate it for the good of the realm, they have often met with failure, with the settlers seemingly besieged and driven off by the very forest itself.\n\nA myth has been born from this hostility, claiming that a wicked queen inhabits the forest, defending her forsaken wilderness from the ‘hostilities’ of civilization. While these are surely just the ramblings of panicked settlers, they have begun to spread through our population. This has not only sowed panic amongst our ponies but has also made it difficult to attract settlers for future ventures into the forests."

 #Nation Focuses
 DEP_Advisors:0 "Privy Council of 1007"
 DEP_Advisors_desc:0 "The Privy Council of Deponya is made up of King Grimhoof and his closest advisors. These few individuals act as the central source of authority for the nation, wielding the bulk of decision-making powers. Within recent years, the council has included Prince Bountiful Harvest, Lady Lancetrot, Stealthy Serpent, and High Priestess Radiant Glory."
 DEP_Alchemist:0 "The Alchemist’s First Tenure"
 DEP_Alchemist_desc:0 "Stealthy Serpent, also known as the Alchemist, is a renown potion-maker and medicine pony. Under their guidance, King Grimhoof has called for a two-pronged approach to handling the nation’s many problems. The first would include reforms that would improve access to education, while the second would see investments made into the lucrative potion-making industry."

 DEP_Alchemist_education_for_foals:0 "Donate to the Chapels"
 DEP_Alchemist_education_for_foals_desc:0 "Chapels are a staple in Deponian villages with their priests often being the only literature individual in the community, meaning that they are often alone in providing education to the local populace. If we were to donate to these chapels, we could provide them with the means of hiring additional staff and aquiring the resources necessary for teaching."
 DEP_Alchemist_history_teaching:0 "Lessons from the Past"
 DEP_Alchemist_history_teaching_desc:0 "In a nation as old and traditional as Deponya, it is surprising how little the average commoner knows about their history and heritage. In order to address this, the King has given permission to Stealthy Serpent to draft a lecture on Deponian history to be presented within chapels, squares, and other public venues."
 DEP_Alchemist_funds_for_poition_training:0 "Establish the Potion-Maker's Guild"
 DEP_Alchemist_funds_for_poition_training_desc:0 "Within recent years, potion-making has become a highly lucrative business within Deponya, with their export growing annually. This is due to increasing consumption by foreign elites who are desperate for natural remedies to their ailments. By creating a formalized guild, with established rules, we can ensure proper regulations, quality control, and secure the reputation of our wares."
 DEP_Alchemist_forest_investment:0 "The Eygsic Charter"
 DEP_Alchemist_forest_investment_desc:0 "Due to the hostile nature of the Eygsic Forest, few industrial enterprises have managed to prosper in the region. However, the Potion-Maker’s Guild has put forth a plan to establish a branch office within the forest and begin extracting the precious herbs needed for their trade. All they require is the consent of the crown and a formal charter to set up operations."
 DEP_Alchemist_national_teaching_class:0 "Establish the Deponian School System"
 DEP_Alchemist_national_teaching_class_desc:0 "While chapel schools have served our nation for generations, the uneven quality and diversity in curriculums has often slowed our nation’s ability to tackle basic literacy. By investing in a crown-run school system, independent of the church, we can ensure a unified curriculum and a basic level of quality in teaching staff."

 DEP_Industry_begining_desc:0 "Deponya is a proud nation built on tradition hailing back to the dawn of times. But clinging to tradition is the death of innovation. However this day is not the day Deponya says no to the traditions which made her great but the day she says yes to the future."
 DEP_Industry_infrastructur_goes_well:0 "Rails to the Future"
 DEP_Industry_infrastructur_goes_well_desc:0 "One of our scientists had the opportunity to study the Royal Equestrian railway system, the finest of its kind in the world. He proposed a similar system that can connect the dispersed cities of the kingdom which would provide a basis for any and every industrial improvements."
 DEP_Industry_modernizing_effort:0 "Picking Prickly Pears"
 DEP_Industry_modernizing_effort_desc:0 "While it's one of the most sacred traditions to have every tree bucked by the farmers who care for it daily, it's just about the slowest way to go about that process. By having a small dedicated group of unicorns do it the time it takes can be reduced ten-fold."
 DEP_Industry_electric_research:0 "Swimming with the Current"
 DEP_Industry_electric_research_desc:0 "It is abundantly clear that the energy of the future is electricity. Deponya's grid however is basically non-existent.

 DEP_Industry_factory_and_modernize:0 "Mass Produced Pears"

 DEP_Industry_Poverty_efforts:0 "The Fruits of Labour"
 DEP_Industry_Poverty_efforts_desc:0 "It's absolutely abhorrent that the ponies who work the hardest for Deponya's newfound success see the least their work's fruits. The Deponian government has proposed a number of laws that are aimed to redirect the wealth to those who have the least."
 DEP_Industry_more_space:0 "Mass Produced Ponies"
 DEP_Industry_more_space_desc:0 "Our efforts to modernise agriculture has led to a surplus of food which predictably spiked the population growth.

 DEP_Industry_learning_is_fun:0 "Enlighning the Darkness"

 DEP_Industry_racial_ways_desc:0 "Earthponies have always been sneered at for their lack of obvious magic abilities. And while it's surely not as flashy as a unicorns’ or pegasi’s abilities it's as essential for running the nation, as water is for life. It's time everypony learnt that lesson."
 DEP_Industry_more_efficent_factories:0 "Mass Produced Everything Else"

By creating a streamlined line of production where each pony has to do just one simple job, the pace of production can reach previously unimaginable levels."
 DEP_Industry_more_construction:0 "Mass Produced Barns"
 DEP_Industry_more_construction_desc:0 "Raising barns in the old fashioned way is great bonding activity for the entire family.

 DEP_Army_begining:0 "Turning Greens into Reds"
 DEP_Army_begining_desc:0 "Not even the most loyal subjects of Deponya can deny the sorry state in which the Royal Army is. It mainly consists of inexperienced volunteers and a few bobble heads posing as officers. Before anything else can be done the damaged branches need to be cut back on so the new ones can sprout and flourish. From top to bottom everypony in the military needs to be brought up to speed or discarded."

 DEP_Army_Factory_why_not_desc:0 "Long past the days where the valour of the soldiers of Deponya alone could win a thousand battle. In the modern warfare the means with which the soldiers fight are just as important as the soldiers themselves.

 DEP_Army_Gun_bonus_good:0 "Down with the Swords"
 DEP_Army_Gun_bonus_good_desc:0 "The Sword much like the Plough has served Deponya well. It is however the duty of the children of Deponya to honour the memory of their fallen heroes by building an army worthy of their deeds.

No, Deponya's armies have always been known as the rooks that anchor the forces of the River Federation. And they shall be forevermore the apotheosis of discipline and loyalty."
 DEP_Army_Grand_batlle_plan_guns:0 "Irrigation with Bullets"
 DEP_Army_Grand_batlle_plan_guns_desc:0 "The ability to kill the enemy proved to be an essential one. However Deponya's brightest researchers are already exploring new ideas which allow every soldier to kill multiple enemies at lightning speed.

 DEP_Army_Grand_batlle_plan_support:0 "Propping the Corps"
 DEP_Army_Grand_batlle_plan_support_desc:0 "Just as various crops need something to be propped up by to grow strong so does our corps need the necessary support equipment to operate optimally.

 DEP_Army_Grand_batlle_plan_artillery_tank:0 "Growing Girthy Guns"
 DEP_Army_Grand_batlle_plan_artillery_tank_desc:0 "One way to make a gun more efficient is to increase its fire rate. A simpler one is to just increase its size. After all how many griffs can a gun kill if it can easily down a giant spider from the Eygsic forest?"
 DEP_Army_Grand_batlle_plan_idea:0 "The Stalwarts of Deponya"
 DEP_Army_Grand_batlle_plan_idea_desc:0 "The armies of Deponya could never extensively rely on the magic of the unicorns or the mobility of the pegasi.

 DEP_Army_modernization:0 "Fishing for Puškas"
 DEP_Army_modernization_desc:0 "Building an army has more to it than just producing weapons and giving them out to soldiers. Sometimes it involves salvaging sometimes threats sometimes even some malicious trickery. But sometimes all a country needs are kind words and flattery to coax a friend into helping her. Maybe good King Grimhoof can work out an advantageous deal at his next official visit to Lake City."
 DEP_Army_more_factories:0 "Growing a Millitary-Industrial Complex"
 DEP_Army_more_factories_desc:0 "If you give a pony a gun you get a soldier. However if you teach a bunch of ponies how to make guns that you can give to other ponies you get an army. Sometimes life is as simple as that."

 DEP_Army_we_live_and_die_in_the_forest_desc:0 "Our lives are inseparably bound to the Eygsic forest. Our trappers and trackers are second to none. It would be folly not to use their knowledge to gain an advantage on the many adversaries we may face."
 DEP_Army_lock_the_other_way:0 "Over the Hedge"
 DEP_Army_lock_the_other_way_desc:0 "It is not the roots that define a tree. And the army shouldn't be defined by its past. Just as Deponya has adapted to challenges of this new age, there is no shame in seeking out other ways to run an army. Deponya has collection of different allies all willing to help her find her way, if she is willing to pay the price."
 DEP_Army_mobile_warfare_opening:0 "Brothers in Arms"
 DEP_Army_mobile_warfare_opening_desc:0 "Lake City has long been Deponya's brother in the vanguard against the griffon aggression. It's only natural that if she wants to learn about the warfare of the new millennium she will turn to her most trusted ally. Lake city has this intriguing prospects that relies heavily on the unrelenting onslaught of these new heavily armoured vehicles they call "Tanks".
 DEP_Army_mobile_warfare_tank_research:0 "Starting Small"
 DEP_Army_mobile_warfare_tank_research_desc:0 "While the Deponian high command had a privilege to glance at the grandiose tank projects of Lake City they all agree those moving mountains are out of the scope of the young Deponian Military-Industrial Complex. However it seems feasible that smaller, faster units are produced which excel at finding the weaknesses in the enemy frontline then encircling entire regiments."
 DEP_Army_mobile_warfare_guns_and_motorized_research:0 "Keeping up"
 DEP_Army_mobile_warfare_guns_and_motorized_research_desc:0 "Using on hooves battalions in tank divisions bars them from utilising their greatest asset: speed. Since using tanks by themself is an unsustainably expensive endeavour it's best to just put all the supporting land troops into light semi-armoured vehicles that can keep pace with even the fastest of tanks."
 DEP_Army_mobile_warfare_production:0 "If you life gives you lemons..."
 DEP_Army_mobile_warfare_production_desc:0 "Deponya doesn't have the rich trading outposts that are all over the place in Lake City. However sometimes weaknesses can be turned into strengths. For example the severe lack of money forced the Deponian engineers to work out solutions make the production cheaper in the long run."
 DEP_Army_mobile_warfare_tankos:0 "Dreaming Big"
 DEP_Army_mobile_warfare_tankos_desc:0 "While the speed of the light tanks is an invaluable asset it is worthless if they can't break the enemy line in the first place. To fight the biggest most entrenched enemy divisions’ heavier tanks with thicker plating are needed. These monstrosities unleash death on yet unseen levels while being seemingly indestructible."
 DEP_Army_mobile_warfare_ende:0 "Army on Wheels"
 DEP_Army_mobile_warfare_ende_desc:0 "While the speed of tanks is one of their greatest strength their effectiveness is limited by the speed of the hoof soldiers. By employing motorised vehicles to carry as much equipment as possible the troops can march longer and faster than ever before, considerably improving the pace of the entire army."
 DEP_Army_superior_firepower_opening:0 "The Magic of High Calibre Ammunition"
 DEP_Army_superior_firepower_opening_desc:0 "It is the King’s royal duty to save his ponies from any harm just as much as it is vice versa. Wittenland has made notable progress in the art of throwing shells at enemy from so far they can’t shoot back. If the military could learn a trick or two from them many lives could be saved which in turn might boost the number of volunteers in the army."
 DEP_Army_superior_firepower_artillery:0 "Putting the "Power" into Firepower"
 DEP_Army_superior_firepower_artillery_desc:0 "If Deponya is to truly implement the doctrines of Wittenland she has to come up with new more effective artillery cannons. Luckily Wittenland was kind enough to provide a few senior engineers who agreed to teach the basics of ballistics to their Deponian colleagues. While their lessons are more than likely incomplete they are still invaluable."
 DEP_Army_superior_firepower_mass_artillery:0 "Hard Work Beats Talent"
 DEP_Army_superior_firepower_mass_artillery_desc:0 "Deponian engineers might lack the wealth of knowledge of their Wittenlandian counterparts but any Deponian works twice as hard as any other pony could even dream of. So whatever design the engineers finish will be produced at an unmatched rate."
 DEP_Army_superior_firepower_gun_and_support:0 "Close Quarters for the Wicked"
 DEP_Army_superior_firepower_gun_and_support_desc:0 "While the whole point of the Wittenlandian doctrine is to keep the enemy at arm’s length, the military has to be ready for those resilient enough to get close to the troops. For this the quality of hand rifles must be improved to match or even outmatch that of our enemies’ rifles."
 DEP_Army_superior_firepower_anti_all:0 "Piercing Through"
 DEP_Army_superior_firepower_anti_all_desc:0 "Recently a new phenomenon has started in various different militaries. They drive vehicles protected by several layers of hard steel into enemy battalions to cause chaos and destruction. Luckily there are already plans for countermeasures it is only a matter of political will and effort to make these cannons a reality."
 DEP_Army_superior_firepower_dokusuriti:0 "Becoming the Master"
 DEP_Army_superior_firepower_dokusuriti_desc:0 "While it is true that the Deponians are mere adopters of the Wittenlandian doctrine at this time it's fair to consider them the best at it. Today it is Deponya not Wittenland from whom the scholars of war seek to learn the finest of details about the art of long distance warfare."
 DEP_Army_mass_assault_opening:0 "Dogpiling the Enemy"
 DEP_Army_mass_assault_opening_desc:0 "Farmers are farmers, workers are workers and soldiers are soldiers. It’s basically impossible to instil the appropriate amount of discipline and tactical knowledge upon a bunch of civilians when the war comes. The Dogs of the Diamond Mountain know this well. It is however more than possible to give them all a gun and send them all to battle in the name of the king. Maybe this approach worth trying."
 DEP_Army_mass_assault_guns:0 "One Pony's Trash..."
 DEP_Army_mass_assault_guns_desc:0 "It’s quite useless to waste state of the art weaponry on soldiers who are barely able to use it, let alone aim at anything smaller than the side of a barn, and are going to die soon anyway. Wittenland however was kind enough to provide Deponya with the schematics of some of her earlier designs as well as a shipment from their outdated stockpile because they wouldn't use it anyways."
 DEP_Army_mass_assault_product:0 "Made in Deponya"
 DEP_Army_mass_assault_product_desc:0 "Based on the Wittnelandian designs and some down to earth ingenuity Deponian engineers were able come up with a few shortcuts in the rifle production technology. The high command decided to use the money saved on the production on building a new factory to further the Deponian war effort that way."
 DEP_Army_mass_assault_support:0 "Advanced Trench Digging"
 DEP_Army_mass_assault_support_desc:0 "The example of the Diamond Dog army demonstrates that the tactical use of a shovel can often be more effective than simply shooting at the enemy. Or at least it would demonstrate it if they used shovels. Which they don't. But the theory behind it should be solid nevertheless."
 DEP_Army_mass_assault_infantry:0 "Tactical fasting"
 DEP_Army_mass_assault_infantry_desc:0 "Based on the research of the Deponian Ministry of Military the properly fed soldiers have a tendency to grow too complacent to be bothered to fight hard on the frontline. This must be avoided at all cost. By reducing the rations of every soldier the high command is not only hoping to make the army more sustainable but more effective as well."
 DEP_Army_mass_assault_ending:0 "If She Can Lift a Gun..."
 DEP_Army_mass_assault_ending_desc:0 "It’s foolish to throw away the best and most physically fit ponies as cannon fodder on the front line. If the conscription standards were lowered the extra bodies could take the brunt of the enemy's fire so the best and most capable would be more likely to live to fight another day."
 DEP_Army_inteligencija:0 "The Đuriđe Bohoofović Academy"
 DEP_Army_inteligencija_desc:0 "The research efforts of the military have been typically consisting of disjointed projects by various think-tanks across the country. By gathering all of them into a single institute where their knowledge ideas can enrich one another the Deponian research capabilities will be elevated to hitherto unheard-of levels."
 DEP_Army_race:0 "Bound by Blood"
 DEP_Army_race_desc:0 "Deponya has always been on the frontier of the River federation. From the Griffons in the west to the unruly dog allies in the north to the many monsters within, Deponya is in many respects the westernmost bulwark of Ponykind in Central Griffonia. It's time for Deponya to tap into her pony heritage if she is to survive the forces coming for her."
 DEP_Army_magic:0 "Bound by Magic"
 DEP_Army_magic_desc:0 "Though every species in the world has some form of connection with magic, noone has refined it quite like the ponies. The sheer scope of possibilities is so vast, it would be utter foolishness not to capitalise on it one way or another."
 DEP_Army_special_forces:0 "Bound by Brotherhood"
 DEP_Army_special_forces_desc:0 "The way ponies are connected to one another is unlike any force known to anyone. It is that connection that ultimately separates them from any other species. This invisible thread makes them capable of completing seemingly impossible missions in the most hostile environments. This would be a great foundation for any special operation unit."
 DEP_Air_beginig:0 "Onto Bluer Pastures"
 DEP_Air_beginig_desc:0 "For centuries most of Deponya’s ponies have looked upon the sky with distant awe. Today will mark the day on which they take the first step on the unbeaten path to Deponya’s sky."
 DEP_Air_catch_up:0 "Wings of Iron"
 DEP_Air_catch_up_desc:0 "Deponya is at a crossroad. It has become clear that the ways of old are no longer sufficient. The brave Pegasi of Deponya are no longer capable to guard the skies on their own. Deponya needs to put more trust into these new flight machines, no matter how unnatural they are."
 DEP_Air_bombing:0 "Feast on Famine"
 DEP_Air_bombing_desc:0 "Just as the body cannot survive without proper sustenance, any war machine collapses as soon it's deprived from its ungodly bread of arms and ammunition. Few understand this as well as the ponies of Deponya. But now the time has come for the world to learn that these “dirty peasants” can not only make the food, they can take it too."
 DEP_Air_bombing_research:0 "Size Does Mean Everything"
 DEP_Air_bombing_research_desc:0 "Deponians had a long and bloody history with the creatures of the Eygsic forest. They had to learn what advantage size can give one in a battle and learn they did. It’s only natural that now that they have the means they gravitate towards the biggest, heaviest war machines they can get their hooves on."
 DEP_Air_tactical_research:0 "Bluer than the Skies"
 DEP_Air_tactical_research_desc:0 "Deponya is no longer the little backwards agrarian country it once was. As her borders reached the ocean new challenges arose. A competent navy is more than just pile of battleships, it’s a combination of every branch of the military."
 DEP_Air_tactical:0 "Balance in All Things"
 DEP_Air_tactical_desc:0 "Few would be foolish enough to deny the power of the air force. Strangely enough, however, there are many who wilfully ignore half of its power in favour of the other. Deponians are not them. For centuries they had to put up with droughts, floods and worse to survive. Their power is versatility their victory lies in adopting to their enemy."
 DEP_Air_tactical_fighter:0 "Harrowing the Sky"
 DEP_Air_tactical_fighter_desc:0 "Just as the soil of the land has to be turned and softened before sowing, the impurities in the air must also be broken down before the seeds of victory can be planted into it."
 DEP_Air_fighter:0 "Land and Sky"
 DEP_Air_fighter_desc:0 "Earthponies - even more so than the other two races - have always relied on their strong ties to their family and community. Now that Deponya faces the horrors of war, this ancient notion is more important than ever. The air force and the land army are but organs of a licing entity. One which can only protect Deponya if every part works together seamlessly."
 DEP_Air_fighter_research:0 "Eggs in a Basket"
 DEP_Air_fighter_research_desc:0 "Just like for the entirety of her history, Deponya is hopelessly outgunned. Unlike the entirety of her history, she is not outgunned by spiders and other horrors but actual guns. If she is to stand a chance she has to concentrate all the resources she has on the frontline."
 DEP_Air_bombing_idea:0 "Bleed Them Dry"
 DEP_Air_bombing_idea_desc:0 "Foreigners would argue that bombing a well-established hinterland is akin to fighting the legendary Hydra. For every factory razed they will raise two anew. Luckily Deponians know that after you cut off a dozen heads or two, the hydra just bleeds out."
 DEP_Air_tactical_idea:0 "Crop Rotation"
 DEP_Air_tactical_idea_desc:0 "Just as the land that is used for the same purpose over and over is doomed to produce less and less each year, so is a tactic used over and over is sure to yield diminishing returns. But if a plethora of different strategies are available and they are rotated regularly, the enemies of Deponya can be kept in the dark."
 DEP_Air_fighter_idea:0 "On the Darkest Night"
 DEP_Air_fighter_idea_desc:0 "Tales as old as time tell about a night when the gates of heaven opened and it rained for 40 days. On the fortieth day, winged ponies came from the sky, and destroyed the clouds. Though the clouds of today are not made of water and the pegasi have been her children for a millennia, Deponya once again will need her new winged friends to clear the skies."
 DEP_Air_rocketo:0 "Growing Strong"
 DEP_Air_rocketo_desc:0 "Even the most majestic tree can grow out from the smallest of seeds. Just like how the air force of Deponya has grown into what it is today from the humblest of beginnings. It is such immeasurable pleasure to see the newest branch of the air force, one that is going to be the tallest and greenest of them all."
 DEP_Air_atom:0 "Life Itself."
 DEP_Air_atom_desc:0 "Deponya has always been the cradle of life. From the myriad creatures of the Eygsic forest to the arable plains of Despoina this country exudes life. It is our unique connection to this land that makes us capable of deciding when life went too far for its own good. It is then when our gentle hooves will pluck the weeds that threaten our beautiful garden."
 DEP_Marine_beginig:0 "Legacy of the Six Rivers"
 DEP_Marine_beginig_desc:0 "Deponya is a land of navigable rivers, with a class of skilled ferrystallions, boat builders, and smugglers born to handle these turbulent waterways. With our recent acquisition of coastal lands, it has become vital that we draft these individuals into our newly established Royal Deponyian Navy and pray that some of their skills transfer."
 DEP_Marine_big_dreams:0 "A Mighty Navy"
 DEP_Marine_big_dreams_desc:0 "The battleship is the flagship of a truly noble navy with its thick armour, mighty guns, and sheer terror factor on the water. While these vessels are expensive to make, and their practicality is coming into question with the recent rise of the aircraft carrier, High Admiral Solar Brisk assures his majesty that an investment in them would be worthwhile."
 DEP_Marine_sneaky_dream:0 "A Practical Navy"
 DEP_Marine_sneaky_dream_desc:0 "Deponya is as infant on the open ocean, with our navy having to be built from the ground up. Meanwhile, many of our foes have had access to the sea for generations and have had years to build up an effective fighting force. As such, we shouldn’t squander our meagre resources on frivolous ships but rather spend them wisely on projects that would maximize our limited scope."
 DEP_Marine_flying_dream:0 "A Modern Navy"
 DEP_Marine_flying_dream_desc:0 "The aircraft carrier is the mark of a modern navy, allowing for the projection of naval power over incredible distances. While there are many hurdles for us to overcome in terms of equipment, tactics, and logistics, Minister of the Navy, Midnight Smooch, assure his majesty that such a focus in ship design would assure our hegemony over Eastern Griffonia."
 DEP_Marine_battleships:0 "Acquire Bakarian Designs"
 DEP_Marine_battleships_desc:0 "Of all the River Coalition’s member states, Bakara has the best record with shipbuilding, producing the alliance’s largest fleet with the BNS Bakara as its flagship. The Bakara was an impressive battleship in its prime, dominating the waters off of Eastern Griffonia. While the design has aged, the acquisition of its blueprints would be very helpful in kickstarting our own designs."
 DEP_Marine_light_cruiser:0 "Fund Domestic Designs"
 DEP_Marine_light_cruiser_desc:0 "Our nation can only borrow so much expertise from our allies. At some point we will need to design ships unique to our experiences, geography, and challenges. Already, competent architects and engineers from across our lands have submitted designs for a truly Deponyian ship. The most promising design is for a light cruiser, drafted by famed Buckbanburg Marine Guild."
 DEP_Marine_dockjards:0 "The Royal Deponyian Dockyards"
 DEP_Marine_dockjards_desc:0 "A fleet centred upon the battleship is not a cheap investment to make. If we wish to rule the waves than we must develop the drydocks needed to build and service these mammoth vessels. The first such facility to be constructed, as part of this programme, is the Royal Deponyian Dockyards which will act as the premium facility for Deponyian shipbuilding."
 DEP_Marine_Heavy_batleships:0 "Improve Bakarian Designs"
 DEP_Marine_Heavy_batleships_desc:0 "While the adoption of Bakarian designs have been incredibly beneficial at kickstarting our naval development, we’ve begun to run into a wall in terms of innovation. It is about time to move beyond our Bakarian forefathers and develop a class of battleships which will be unmatched in terms of firepower, armour, and sheer scale."
 DEP_Marine_big_dreams_idea_one:0 "Renovate the Royal Deponyian Dockyards"
 DEP_Marine_big_dreams_idea_one_desc:0 "As a product of our inexperience and unfamiliarity with shipbuilding, the Royal Deponyian Dockyards have several structural flaws in their design. This is hindering our ability to productively make our heaviest ships. By investing in the renovation of this facility we can correct these structural flaws and streamline the worst of these issues."
 DEP_Marine_battlecruiser:0 "Improve Domestic Designs"
 DEP_Marine_battlecruiser_desc:0 "As our designers begin to feel more comfortable with lower tonnage vessels, they’ve begun to improve their designs, dreaming up heavier and better armoured ships. Recently, a design from the newly minted Deponyian Cargo Ship Guild has seen the development of a capital ship which has the firepower of a battleship but the maneuverability of a cruiser."
 DEP_Marine_big_dreams_idea_two:0 "RADAR Proximity Fuses"
 DEP_Marine_big_dreams_idea_two_desc:0 "While RADAR technology has been readily adopted by our air force, recent advances in design have allowed us to integrate it into our artillery shells. These RADAR proximity fuses can judge how far they are from a target, exploding when close, making them exceptional useful at attacking aircraft, exploding over entrenched positions, and providing effective fire on hostile ships."
 DEP_Marine_u_boot:0 "Hire New Mareland Specialists"
 DEP_Marine_u_boot_desc:0 "While across the Griffonian continent, New Mareland has always enjoyed warm relations with the nations of the River Federation, owing to our common heritage. New Mareland also has easy access to Equestrian naval expertise. By enlisting the help of New Mareland’s engineers and designer we can hopefully capitalize upon this and use Equestrian assets as the foundation of our navy."
 DEP_Marine_destroyer:0 "Enlist Help from the Diamond Mountains"
 DEP_Marine_destroyer_desc:0 "The Royal Diamond Navy is also relatively new and small, being made up of a few light ships. However, the RDS Damazikar and Woofkar were very effective destroyers for their time. By enlisting the help of the Royal Navy’s designers and engineers we can hopefully adopt the diamond dog designs and use them to inspire our indigenous development."
 DEP_Marine_sneaky_dream_idea_one:0 "Reconfigure the River Dockyards"
 DEP_Marine_sneaky_dream_idea_one_desc:0 "Across Deponya there are dozens of small dockyards which service the freshwater vessels that traverse her many rivers. The largest of these rivers can also be navigated by light seafaring warships such as destroyers and submarines. As such, we can begin to outsource work to these dockyards and use their resources to help increase our naval productivity."
 DEP_Marine_heavy_cruiser:0 "Further Assistance from the Mountains"
 DEP_Marine_heavy_cruiser_desc:0 "Our allies in the Diamond Mountains have been tremendously helpful in designing our destroyers, allowing us a cheap but effective means of protecting our coastal waters. Within recent years, their designers have begun to work on a heavy cruiser. If we were to secure this design and coopt it into our fleet, we could benefit greatly from such a heavily armoured vessel."
 DEP_Marine_sneaky_dream_idea_two:0 "Torpedo Development"
 DEP_Marine_sneaky_dream_idea_two_desc:0 "A submarine is little more than a stealthy speedboat without the torpedoes to give it bite.  As such, it should be of our utmost imperative to invest into the development of new and improved torpedo variants with improved speed, distance, and payloads. With these, our navy should have the tools required to defend our interests at sea."
 DEP_Marine_carrier:0 "Barter with Nimbusia"
 DEP_Marine_carrier_desc:0 "When the Nimbusian National Naval Force unveiled the NNS Thunderking, it was received with much fanfare, being the only aircraft carrier on the continent at the time. While its cloud-based design can not be easily replicated by our engineers, it can be adapted to conventional shipbuilding and can help develop our first generation of aircraft carriers."
 DEP_Marine_naval_planes:0 "Collaboration Between Branches"
 DEP_Marine_naval_planes_desc:0 "Due to the low level of industrialization within our nation, both the Royal Deponyian Navy and Royal Deponyian Airforce are newly minted branches of a traditionally army-based military. As such, both are eager to prove themselves and with the recent investment into aircraft carriers the two branches have been given a chance to collaborate and assist each other in this goal."
 DEP_Marine_naval_light_carrier:0 "Indigenous Carrier Designs"
 DEP_Marine_naval_light_carrier_desc:0 "Our designers have become increasingly familiar and comfortable with aircraft carriers and have begun to draft blueprints and design documents independent of our Nimbusian sponsors. While these indigenous carriers are rather light, being built upon river barges, they are still a massive step forwards in terms of naval innovation and native shipbuilding."
 DEP_Marine_flying_dream_idea_one:0 "Diversify Production"
 DEP_Marine_flying_dream_idea_one_desc:0 "The mark of modern industrialism is to diversify production, producing components over a wide range of firms and factories. By doing so we can have one firm working on the hull, another on the deck, a third on the fire control systems, and many more on the various other smaller components. This means that a greater number of productive assets can be committed to a single project."
 DEP_Marine_flying_dream_idea_two:0 "Enlist Nimbusian Officers"
 DEP_Marine_flying_dream_idea_two_desc:0 "The current political climate in Nimbusia has created an exodus of highly skilled military officers. By offering both employment and generous pay to these refugees we can hopefully persuade them to join our military. Nowhere would their impact be greater than within our new carrier battlegroups where their skill and experience in the air can be capitalized upon."
 DEP_Marine_glory_to_us:0 "Dominance of the East"
 DEP_Marine_glory_to_us_desc:0 "With the framework of our navy set in stone, we can now focus upon assuring our dominance of Eastern Griffonian waters. Every dockyard built, every sailor enlisted, and every ship christened brings us one step closer to this dream. Soon our royal banner will be known across the open sea and no port will every deny us."

TRD_annex_FEZ:0 "Liberate Fezera"

TRD_naval_solution:0 "Burst the Naval Bubble"
TRD_naval_solution_desc:0 "The navy is a gigantic part of the Federation's budget, this is well known. What is less well known is why a country that spends so much on their navy has so few ships that can actually fight. This deserves a closer look."
TRD_car_1:0 "Sea and Sky"
TRD_car_1_desc:0 "The new and improved Skyfall Federal Navy shall have fleets based around large aircraft carriers who will in turn deploy untold numbers of torpedo and dive bombers supported by fighters. Unfortunately, for years now the officer's club was more concerned with updating their medal collections than updating the fleet's designs. We've got a lot of work to do."
TRD_car_2:0 "Strategic Destruction on a Naval Scale"
TRD_car_2_desc:0 "The theories of REAF General "Bomber" Blaze have caught on with the new admiralty of the SFN, and they're now attempting to implement her strategic bombing doctrine in the fleet. How that is possible requires more research though."

TRD_bat_2_desc:0 "Admiral Giraud has brought the new admiralty together to find a way to utilize their battleships effectively in the changing world. It will take some time, but they're all in agreement, they're sailing into battle in the fleet they have, not the one they wish they had."
TRD_bat_3:0 "Project Dreadnought"
TRD_bat_3_desc:0 "Admiral Giraud's latest effort to revive the fleet is to provide escorts in the form of light and heavy cruisers. These ships might be boring, but they're also practical."
TRD_bat_4:0 "Project Leviathan"
TRD_bat_4_desc:0 "The culmination of Admiral Giraud's efforts are the super-battleship designs of Project Leviathan. He seems almost weary as he signs off on the final documents. Weary, but hopeful."
TRD_naval_base_expansion:0 "Expand the Skyfall Shipyards"
TRD_naval_base_expansion_desc:0 "Perhaps the biggest crime of the old admiralty was the squalor that the SFN's shipyards were allowed to fall into. Complete renovations are needed and after that an expansion to accommodate the new ship designs."

TRD_blackjack_whiskey:0 "Fund the Blackjack Brewery"
TRD_blackjack_whiskey_desc:0 "The Blackjack Brewery is the hot spot to be for all the young folk. Funding them will surely pay dividends in the future."
TRD_tobacco_field:0 "Expand the Tobacco Fields"
TRD_tobacco_field_desc:0 "Got a cig? Of course you don't. There's far too much demand and not nearly enough supply for that product. We need to clear more land for the tobacco plantations to expand before we can get a smoke. Also, the doctors are saying tobacco can be used to cure Ebola, which is nice too if you're into that."
TRD_cigars:0 "Old Ones Cigarettes"
TRD_cigars_desc:0 "Old Ones Cigarettes, each puff feels like you're selling your soul to an eldritch abomination."
TRD_oil_refinery:0 "Synthetic Oil Projects"
TRD_oil_refinery_desc:0 "We're not entirely sure what's in this oil, but it's artificial and we need it. Throw science against the wall if you have to, just make it happen."
TRD_rubber:0 "Invest in Synthetic Rubber"
TRD_rubber_desc:0 "Turns out synthetic rubber is actually better than natural rubber in every way. Who knew? We should get on production of it."
TRD_full_recovery:0 "Come on Down to Skyfall!"
TRD_full_recovery_desc:0 "After years of budget problems the Federal government's spending is finally in check. With that we can lower taxes and make a big address to the world on how Skyfall is the place to go for all their economic needs."
TRD_industrial_tech:0 "Invite Foreign Industrial Experts"
TRD_industrial_tech_desc:0 "Our domestic industry has improved greatly over the last few years, but it can always be better. We should invite experts to our lands to help us improve."

TRD_industrial_development_desc:0 "Simple civilian concrete and toaster factories might not be exciting, but they form the core of our economy."
TRD_arms_projects:0 "Create an Arms Industry"
TRD_arms_projects_desc:0 "Skyfall has always gone abroad when looking for weapons to defend itself, but the day may soon come when we cannot buy arms. When the bonds of fellowship will fail. When all hope seems lost. That day is not today and so we are given leave to prepare."
TRD_extra_slot:0 "Reopen the Skyfall Academy of Science"
TRD_extra_slot_desc:0 "The SAS was once the premier scientific institution on the west coast. People of all species came from the farthest corners of the earth to learn there. Now it is a derelict, but not for long."

TRD_mechainsed_agriculture_desc:0 "Instead of digging in the dirt with our muscles why not use some of our new machines to do the work for us?"
TRD_military_reform:0 "A New Army"
TRD_military_reform_desc:0 "With the strike now dealt with, the Federation has the chance to finally focus on its long neglected ground forces. During the long civil war the Skyfall Federal Army was dedicated mostly to the protection of the nation's small land borders; turning away looters and bandits and acting as a police force when needed. It served well in this role, but times are changing, and the general staff is divided on how to proceed."
TRD_guns_2:0 "Get New Artillery"
TRD_guns_2_desc:0 "One of the biggest features of modern war is the prevalence of massive artillery batteries. Our citizens will remember seeing entire divisions of line infantry in foreign lands being annihilated by the explosive power of a well placed artillery barrage and through that horror one thing was clear: we had to get some of those."
TRD_guns_1:0 "Modern Firearms"
TRD_guns_1_desc:0 "Perhaps even more iconic than the artillery in modern war is the RAT-a-TAT-TAT of the machinegun. These used to be quite expensive, but prices have gone down significantly now that peace has broken out over most of the world. It's a buyer's market and we aim to pay."
TRD_guns_3:0 "Dedicated Support Squads"
TRD_guns_3_desc:0 "All these new artillery pieces and machineguns are eating up a lot of supplies. To counteract this we need new dedicated support units to effectively keep us in the fight."
TRD_grander_army:0 "A Grand Army"
TRD_grander_army_desc:0 "As a smaller nation the Federation needs every able-bodied griffon ready to fight and our new grand army program shall get them up off the street and into the recruiting office."
TRD_grand_1:0 "The Fortress of Skyfall"
TRD_grand_1_desc:0 "For years the SFA held the line and it shall do so for years more, but it shall also do so much more. It shall build great battlements, dig deep trenches and plot grand plans. The enemy shall send their attacks fruitlessly against us. Then, when the time is right we shall strike back with force a thousand times greater."
TRD_grand_2:0 "The Greatest Rifles"
TRD_grand_2_desc:0 "The SFA must have more than forgotten weapons, they must have the greatest weapons. For the basic infantry griffon this means something that is light, cost-effective, reliable, easy-to-use and able to deliver a tremendous amount of firepower with extreme rapidity. It sounds like an impossible task, but our engineers assure us that it's actually very simple."
TRD_grand_3:0 "The Sharpest Shovels"
TRD_grand_3_desc:0 "In order for our army to weather the onslaught of our foes they need the best tools in the world. They must have binoculars so fine they could be used to read a business card at a thousand yards, radios that come in clear even on a stormy day and shovels so sharp you could use them to cut through your opponent's sword."
TRD_grand_4:0 "A Fortified Position"
TRD_grand_4_desc:0 "As a wise Griffon once said, forts win wars. A central component of our build up is the ability of the SFA to take a beating and our fort building is behind schedule. A rapid deployment of concrete is necessary."
TRD_grand_5:0 "A Great Plan"
TRD_grand_5_desc:0 "We've got the skills, we got the equipment, we got the stadium, now all we need is the playbook. It's time for our general staff to put their heads together to find a way to win the war."
TRD_mass_1:0 "A Sea of Feathers and Blood"
TRD_mass_1_desc:0 "A classical battleplan of the Equestrian is to overwhelm your foes with superior numbers and our military liaisons have learned much of their foreign ways. We also, uh, don't actually have the population to make that strategy viable. Nevertheless, certain generals are confident that they can adapt the strategy to us, or at the very least get a great deal on some premium Equestrian arms."
TRD_mass_2:0 "Arm the People"
TRD_mass_2_desc:0 "We need to distribute weapons to our population for our new strategy. Fortunately, General Agnelli has been able to dig up a few thousand rifles for the soldiers. What a steal!"
TRD_mass_3:0 "Blot out the Sky"
TRD_mass_3_desc:0 "The backbone of any great mass assault doctrine is a strong force of artillery to make sure we actually outnumber our foes when our troops reach their lines. It's a good thing then that General Agnelli was able to buy a few hundred units in the far off land of Kludgetown. Also, our general staff is banned from Kludgetown now."
TRD_mass_4:0 "Inform the Families"
TRD_mass_4_desc:0 "In times of war people will die, this is an inevitable fact. To lessen the casualties General Agnelli has bought entrenching tools, radios, and other such equipment for the families of those serving. That way they can assist their loved ones in combat while remaining on the homefront. Now it's time to tell them that they'll have spend two hours a week learning how to dig a proper trench or tune a radio for the rest for their days."
TRD_mass_5:0 "An Ocean of Griffons"
TRD_mass_5_desc:0 "Though we are few we shall nevertheless show the world our steel with the grandest army the world has ever known."
TRD_the_brave_army:0 "The Brave Few"
TRD_the_brave_army_desc:0 "In our nation's time interacting with mercenaries defending trade convoys they have learned that there's two kinds of soldiers in the world: the undefeated elite, and everyone else. We aim for the SFA to be made up of the first kind of soldier."
TRD_mobile_1:0 "Lightning Warfare"
TRD_mobile_1_desc:0 "Fast and furious strikes utilizing motor vehicles that succeed in their objectives before the enemy has a chance to react are the way of the future. It's time we embrace this fact."
TRD_mobile_2:0 "The Modern Knights"
TRD_mobile_2_desc:0 "Chivalry is dead, but only because the dictionary says so, at least according to General Citroen. If we redefine it and give our knights tanks, they shall be able to continue fighting for decades to come. Metaphorically, of course."
TRD_mobile_3:0 "A Bulwark of Steel"
TRD_mobile_3_desc:0 "New developments in armor technology must be continuously researched, for that reason General Citroen has personally financed the research of a new medium tank. This tank promises to be neither too speedy nor too armored, but it'll pack a big gun."
TRD_mobile_4:0 "Project Cerberus"
TRD_mobile_4_desc:0 "To further armor development General Citroen has started Project Cerberus, a design competition for a new heavy tank. The general has personally assured us that the vehicle will be cheap, and it won't get lose and start killing all our guys."
TRD_mobile_5:0 "The Ceaseless March"
TRD_mobile_5_desc:0 "What happens if our troops just keep marching? Conquest. Conquest is what happens."
TRD_superior_1:0 "The Greatest Army"
TRD_superior_1_desc:0 "Integrated support units, shock and awe, Air-Land Battle, and overwhelming firepower. These are the words that shall come to define the greatest army in the world, our army."
TRD_superior_2:0 "The Return of Chivalry"
TRD_superior_2_desc:0 "General Price II has called for a reformation of the Knights of Skyfall. This ancient order has lost its way, he says, and must be reborn for the new era. If his reforms go through there will likely be a lot of people looking to join up."
TRD_superior_3:0 "Specialised Armies"
TRD_superior_3_desc:0 "As part of General Price II's continued reforms he has called for the expansion of other special forces groups. Marines to defend the seaways, mountaineers for extreme conditions, and paratroopers to exploit the benefits of our new air force. All are needed in his eyes."
TRD_superior_4:0 "Taskforce 141"
TRD_superior_4_desc:0 "The special forces of the new Skyfall Federal Army are already some of the best around, but General Price II feels that's not enough and has formed the epitome of airborne training. Taskforce 141, the finest group of clawpicked warriors on the planet."
TRD_superior_5:0 "Born to Kill"
TRD_superior_5_desc:0 "The best and the brightest make up the SFA, the greatest collection of elite fighters the world has ever seen. They stand ready to defend our way of life and the lives our allies. No-one will find them wanting."
TRD_federal_airforrce:0 "Create the SFAF"
TRD_federal_airforrce_desc:0 "The Federation's air forces have traditionally been a hodgepodge of different commands, but as aircraft have become ever more advanced and powerful it has become clear that we must follow the example of other nations and form our own dedicated airborne service branch. The Skyfall Federal Air Force shall rule the skies!"
TRD_air_doc:0 "Adopt a Doctrine"
TRD_air_doc_desc:0 "Now that the SFAF is off the ground it's going to need a doctrine to base procurement and training around. This is a much simpler task than one might think. Actually implementing it will be the difficult part."
TRD_bomber_1:0 "Acquire Modern Bombers"
TRD_bomber_1_desc:0 "As the new saying goes, 'Fighter pilots make movies, bomber pilots make history.' A great slogan, but it doesn't mean much if our pilots don't have anything to fly. We shall fix that."
TRD_bomber_2:0 "Tactical Bomber Models"
TRD_bomber_2_desc:0 "Medium bombers represent a good compromise on operational capabilities that makes them very desirable for the SFAF."
TRD_bomber_3:0 "Strategic Bomber Models"
TRD_bomber_3_desc:0 "Heavy bombers are expensive, slow, and griffonpower heavy. They also are capable of flattening an entire country. Naturally, our people are very interested in this."
TRD_fight_1:0 "Acquire Modern Fighters"
TRD_fight_1_desc:0 "Our current fighters were amazing a decade ago, but now they're obsolete and more harmful to our own pilots than the enemy."
TRD_fight_2:0 "Focus on Light Fighters"
TRD_fight_2_desc:0 "The so called pursuit aircraft have been the backbone of air forces for years, able to not only perform recon but also attack other fighters in death-defying dogfights. It is clear that we should focus on them."
TRD_fight_3:0 "Focus on Heavy Fighters"
TRD_fight_3_desc:0 "Heavy fighters are able to perform moderately well the job of practically every other aircraft save heavy bombers and do so over extreme distances as well. It is clear that we must focus on this multirole aircraft."
TRD_skyfall_airpot:0 "Expand the Skyfall Airport"
TRD_skyfall_airpot_desc:0 "The Skyfall International Airport as served as a staple of air travel for centuries, but with the addition of fixed wing aircraft to the market place many feel that it's time for an upgrade."

The most important and relevant of which is the Great Strike which is currently consuming the nation, if we don't do anything about the thousands of students and strikers in the streets we risk a full scale uprising, the majority of our advisors and fellow councilors are suggesting we sic the army on the strikers, but perhaps a more gentle touch is required?"

tradefed.4.d:0 "After a brief moment of stunned silence, the protestors thoroughly angered by the army cutting down their comerades rushed our soldiers and fought like Griffons possessed, unfortuantely for them we had more guns than them.

tradefed.6.a:0 "Long live the Chancellor!"
tradefed.7.t:0 "The Revolution"
tradefed.7.d:0 "After the initial violence against the protestors failed to cow the strikers into submission, tensions were escelated to a boiling point, but not a soul in the Federation expected what happened next. The Protestors supported by various military units that switched sides during the chaos stormed the Federative Council and deposed Chancellor Genevieve after which they promptly disolved the Federation and shortly thereafter proclaimed the Skyfall People's Republic with Gaubert Girard as it's first President."
tradefed.7.a:0 "Long live the Revolution!"
tradefed.8.t:0 "Negotiations"
tradefed.8.d:0 "Despite the best wishes and suggestions of her advisor and fellow Councilmbembers the Chancellor has decided to meet Gaubert Girard and the Strike leaders. After some harsh words from both sides of the negotiating table in the end both the Chancellor and Girard were able to reach an accord."
tradefed.8.a:0 "The Chancellor agreed to all of the Strikers' demands"
tradefed.8.b:0 "The Chancellor agreed to most of the Strikers' demands"
tradefed.9.t:0 "The Revolution"
tradefed.9.d:0 "In accordance to the Strikers' demands Chancellor Genevieve has formally stepped down as the leader of the Trade Federation, and in her place Gaubert Girard took the reigns of the country, shortly afterwards the Skyfall People's Republic was proclaimed and the Federative Council disolved."
tradefed.9.a:0 "Something feels off..."
tradefed.10.t:0 "The Woodpeckers"
tradefed.10.d:0 "It happened almost too suddenly for anyone to react, but two weeks after the proclimation of the Skyfall People's Republic the Woodpeckers made their move. In the middle of the night they struck, murdering nearly every representative of the Skyfall People's Council inculding President Girard himself, after which they used their ties to the old Federation's Military to take over both Grifftonia and Skyfall before anyone could even react... by early dawn the Woodpeckers had almost singleclawedly restored the Federation, and proclaimed their Grandmaster Ghislain Guichard as Chancellor."
tradefed.10.a:0 "Long Live the Chancellor!"
tradefed.11.t:0 "Peaceful Resolution"
tradefed.11.d:0 "After tense negotiations the Chancellor has agreed to some of Girard's demands, and while some strikers decided to stay in the streets to voice their discontent the majority quietly left for their homes. However, something seems off, what should have been a great victory for Genevieve and the current Government has been met with a rather cold reception by the rest of the Federation's representatives, particularly Vice-Chancellor Guichard who seemed outright vivid."
tradefed.11.a:0 "Something seems fishy..."
tradefed.12.t:0 "Chaos in the Streets"
tradefed.12.d:0 "Due to the Government doing literally nothing the streets of Skyfall have turned into a battleground, only fate shall decide what happens next."
tradefed.12.a:0 "To the Strongest"
tradefed.13.t:0 "The Woodpeckers"
tradefed.13.d:0 "During the chaos that consumed the nation Vice-Chancellor Ghislain took over the reigns of Government and managed to stabilise the situation, shortly after he proclaimed himself the acting Chancellor of the Federation."
tradefed.13.a:0 "Long live the New Chancellor!"
tradefed.14.t:0 "The Center Holds"
tradefed.14.d:0 "After a long week of violence Chancellor Genevieve with the help of the Federal military has managed to retain control of the Federation and her Chancellorship, although she will need to institute major reforms to make sure it stays that way."
tradefed.14.a:0 "Long live the Federation!"
tradefed.15.t:0 "The Revolution"
tradefed.15.d:0 "In the end once the fires had settled down and the populace calmed the Strikers managed to coup the Government, disolve the Federation and proclaimed the Skyfall People's Republic with Gaubert Girard as it's first acting President."
tradefed.15.a:0 "Long Live the Revolution!"
tradefed.16.t:0 "A New Federation"
tradefed.16.d:0 "With the insidious forces of the Woodpeckers beaten at long last and with the governmental and societal reforms instituted by Chancellor Genevieve now fully in place we can hardly call ourselves a Trade Federation anymore, thus the time has come for Chancellor Genevieve to proclaim the foundation of the First Republic of Skyfall with herself as our President."
tradefed.16.a:0 "Long live the Republic!"
tradefed.17.t:0 "An Invitation"
tradefed.17.d:0 "The recently created Skyfall Republic has invited us to join their new country, offering us many economic benefits should we join."
tradefed.17.a:0 "We shall join"
tradefed.17.b:0 "We respectfully decline"
tradefed.18.t:0 "The Fezzerian Accept"
tradefed.18.d:0 "The Fezzerian seeing wisdom in our offer have decided to join our nation, bringing millions of new citizens into our Republic."
tradefed.18.a:0 "Great!"
tradefed.19.t:0 "The Fezzerian Decline"
tradefed.19.d:0 "The Fezzerian have decided to decline our generous offer, while we could take their decisions lying down and lose out on the valuable Fezaran trade ports perhaps we should take a more militant approach?"
tradefed.19.a:0 "To war we go!"
tradefed.19.b:0 "But... that would be unconstitutional"
tradefed.20.t:0 "An Invitation"
tradefed.20.d:0 "The recently created Skyfall Republic has invited us to join their new country, offering us many economic benefits should we join."
tradefed.20.a:0 "We shall join"
tradefed.20.b:0 "We respectfully decline"
tradefed.21.t:0 "The Graf Accepts?"
tradefed.21.d:0 "Trough what must be some form of divine intervention the Graf of Haukland has decided to join our nation, after which he promptly boarded his biplane and flew off into the sunset.,,"
tradefed.21.a:0 "Great?"
tradefed.22.t:0 "The Graf Declines"
tradefed.22.d:0 "To no one's suprise Graf Meyer has decided to not join the Republic, and while we could most certainly take this lying down, we could relatively easily take over the Hauklands should we decide to do so."
tradefed.22.a:0 "To war we go!"
tradefed.22.b:0 "But... that would be unconstitutional"
tradefed.23.t:0 "The Grandmaster"
tradefed.23.d:0 "As more and more power was eroded from the Trade Council it became more obvious to everyone living in our nation that the Federation's hours were numbered, the final blow was struck today as Chancellor Guichard had nearly all of the members of the Federal Council arrested and shot, after which he promptly declared the founding of the Skyfall State and that the ancient Woodpecker Society would lead the newly proclaimed nation with himself at the new government's head."
tradefed.23.a:0 "Long live the Grandmaster!"
tradefed.24.t:0 "The President's Speech"
tradefed.24.d:0 "My friends, we hold a unique spot in the world, we have traded with the world for centuries, we have seen Kingdoms rise and fall, Tyrants live and die, and yet here we persist a center of learning and trade, and yet what have we done? We bend over for every Despot that comes our way, and stand for nothing, but the time has come to change that. We shall build a legacy to outlast not just the Republic, but the world! We shall spread the Revolution to all the peoples of the World trough trade!"
tradefed.24.a:0 "Into the World we go!"
tradefed.25.t:0 "Bursting the Bubble"
tradefed.25.d:0 "After reviewing our national treasutry and what exactly the money was being spent on, it turned out that about 80% of our annual income was being spent on maintaing the navy or rather on paying our naval officers... needless to say this is not intuitive to the economy in any way what so ever, to make matters worse the navy itself has fallen into practical disrepair and thus maintaining it has become an even more monumental task. Even though cutting our naval funding will somewhat fix the economy the navy will continue be a significant drain on our treasury should we not take drastic action to reform it."
tradefed.25.a:0 "Scrap and sell all the ships, and buy new ones"
tradefed.25.b:0 "Repair all of the ships"
tradefed.26.t:0 "Open for Business"
tradefed.26.d:0 "At long last we have managed to return our economy to some semblance of decency, and we can finally get back to trading with the outside world."
tradefed.26.a:0 "Come on down to Skyfall!"
tradefed.27.t:0 "Quite an Offer"
tradefed.27.d:0 "Recently we have been visited by merchants from the city of Skyfall bearing various luxury goods, most notably cigars and whiskey. Apparently they have been sent to negotiate a trade deal on the behalf of their new Government. How do we respond?"
tradefed.27.a:0 "Why not, they seem nice enough"
tradefed.27.b:0 "We don't need their degeneracy here"
tradefed.28.t:0 "[From.GetName] Agreed to our Trade Deal"
tradefed.28.d:0 "After some tense negotiation [From.GetName] has accepted our trade deal!"
tradefed.28.a:0 "Great!"
tradefed.29.t:0 "[From.GetName] Declines our Trade Deal"
tradefed.29.d:0 "Despite out best efforts [From.GetName] has declined our trade deal."
tradefed.29.a:0 "You win some, you lose some"
tradefed.30.t:0 "Military Matters"
tradefed.30.d:0 "The Federation has never had any need for a strong military, trough most of our history we have either relied on foreign rulers or our money to keep us safe, but in these turbulent times we can no longer rely on money alone to protect us from the whims of our neighbours, we must create a proper army, but our staff is divided between creating a small proffesional force or attempt to create a grand army by conscripting our citizens?"
tradefed.30.a:0 "Arm everything that moves, we'll drown our enemies in blood"
tradefed.30.b:0 "A small and proffesional force is what we need"
tradefed.31.t:0 "Friends from Abroad"
tradefed.31.d:0 "Our trading partners have sent us troops to help defend us, provided they're motivated by pragmatism rather than any love for us, but it's still nice to get at least some help"
tradefed.31.a:0 "They could have showed up a bit earlier"
tradefed.34.t:0 "A Deal With the Changelings?"
tradefed.34.d:0 "With our recent foray into the fun world of creature trafficking we have come upon a practical gold mine. However, some of our Lodgemembers have come up with a rather interesting scheme. They intend to sell some of our stock to the Changelings of the Far West in exchange for their assistance in military matters and technology. Shall we send the delegation?"
tradefed.34.a:0 "I always wanted some of those Panzers!"
tradefed.34.b:0 "You simply can't trust the Bugs"
tradefed.35.t:0 "An Unlikely Deal"
tradefed.35.d:0 "We have recently been approached by several Griffons representing the Skyfall Trade Federation. They have offered to provide us with all manner of sentient creatures to feed off of... if we agree to become their trade partners and provide them with some military assistance. How shall we respond?"
tradefed.35.a:0 "It's a deal!"
tradefed.35.b:0 "We can catch out own food, thank you very much"
tradefed.36.t:0 "The Changelings Accept"
tradefed.36.d:0 "The Changelings have accepted our trade deal, and have even sent us some Panzers!"
tradefed.36.a:0 "Wonderful!"
tradefed.37.t:0 "The Changelings Decline"
tradefed.37.d:0 "The Changelings have unfortuantely decided to decline our trade deal."
tradefed.37.a:0 "Can't win them all I suppouse"
tradefed.38.t:0 "Red Mecrchants"
tradefed.38.d:0 "Our authorities have recently started uncovering large amounts of revolutionary propaganda and in some cases even weapons in the various trade ports around our nation. Who is responsible for this occurance is currently unknown, but whoever they are they seem to be dedicated to spreading communism."
tradefed.38.a:0 "I wonder who is behind this"
tradefed.39.t:0 "Missing Citizens"
tradefed.39.d:0 "There has been an increased number of missing citizens in our trade ports as of recently, we have no clue who is behind these dissaperances. To make matters worse our police forces have proven incapable of finding even a single clue to the whereabouts of our missing citizens..."
tradefed.39.a:0 "I wonder who is behind this"
tradefed.40.t:0 "A Deal with Nyumba?"
tradefed.40.d:0 "It is well known that the Zebras of Nyumba practice slavery on a regular basis, and with our recent entrance into Creature trafficking their services could prove rather useful, thus some of our advisors and ministers have proposed we make a deal with the Zebras. What shall we do?"
tradefed.40.a:0 "Let's make them a deal"
tradefed.40.b:0 "If it's stripped it ain't right"
tradefed.41.t:0 "An Interesting Offer"
tradefed.41.d:0 "Our raiders have recently been approached by representative of the Skyfall Federation, who wish to buy slaves from us. In exchange for a steady stream of slaves we would be supplied with both rifles and a steady supply of cash, what shall we do?"
tradefed.41.a:0 "It's a deal!"
tradefed.41.b:0 "I don't trust those filthy Skyfallers..."
tradefed.42.t:0 "The Nyumbans Agrees"
tradefed.42.d:0 "The Nyumbans have decided to accept out generous offer, and their... product has now entered our market"
tradefed.42.a:0 "Who would have thought you could make a deal with Zebras?"
tradefed.43.t:0 "The Nyumbans Decline"
tradefed.43.d:0 "Despite our best efforts the Nyumbans have decided to reject our generous offer, and thus we shall be forced to find other sources of Ponies to sell"
tradefed.43.a:0 "Oh well, you win some, you lose some"

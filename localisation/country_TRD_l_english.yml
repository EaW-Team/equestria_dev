TRD_the_iron_chancellor:0 "The Iron Chancellor"
TRD_the_iron_chancellor_desc:0 "When the Republican Uprising threw the Griffonian Empire into chaos, Skyfall, the Imperial Fleet’s main naval base, threatened to get ruined in the ensuing anarchy.  Fortunately, Chancellor Guichard’s decisive action saved the city from the ruin and conflict that consumed the heart of the Empire. The griffon assumed full and absolute control over Skyfall, but his firm claw guided the city away from the brink of destruction.\n\nIn the years that followed, Guichard ruthlessly crushed any opposition to his rule, both from Republican hopefuls and Imperial loyalists, earning him the nickname of ‘Iron Chancellor’. However, his clear vision and indominable purpose managed to not only secure Skyfall's sovereignty, but turn it into an oasis of peace and prosperity in the war-torn lands of Griffonia. Although the light in his eyes still shine brightly, the iron chancellor is getting rusty, leaving many to fear for Skyfall’s future."
TRD_the_riches_of_skyfall:0 "The Biggest Little City in Griffonia"
TRD_the_riches_of_skyfall_desc:0 "Just as Griffenheim is the proud political heart of Griffonia, and Griffonstone its ancient spiritual heart, Skyfall is the bustling heart of trade on the continent. Vessels from all four corners of our planet find their way to our harbour, where merchants buy the bulk of the goods to be distributed throughout the Heartlands.\n\nMany of the more exotic artifacts and produce is sold directly in the crowded shopping streets and market squares of the city. And any being who visits our city will marvel at the sheer diversity of peoples and wares that Skyfall offers, instilling desires they didn’t know they could have. Of course, what is bought and sold in the city ultimately matters little, as long as a portion of that unfathomable wealth reaches our treasury."
TRD_social_inequality:0 "Social Inequality"
TRD_social_inequality_desc:0 "While Skyfall has, for the most part managed to avoid the issues that plague the rest of Griffonia, its unique way of governing is not without its flaws. Although embracing capitalism has made Skyfall incredibly wealthy, its prosperity has not been distributed evenly across the population of the Federation.\n\nWithout any restrictions to trade, local manufacturing and agriculture have the impossible task of competing with the entire world. Many non-trading businesses failed, leaving many griffons without a livelihood, especially outside of Skyfall itself. This social and economic inequality will continue to take its toll on the populace, until some sort of solution is found."

### Focuses ###
#Normal MIlitary#
TRD_decentralised_command:0 "Decentralised Command Structure"
TRD_decentralised_command_desc:0 "Some griffons, both in the army and out, have began to promote the idea of a less centralised army. While this would reduce our army's effectiveness overall, it would both allow more fluid tactics on the individual level as well as paving the way for new tactics."
TRD_motor_factories:0 "The Orthos Contract"
TRD_motor_factories_desc:0 "Orthos Motors, one of the most prominent companies in their market, could be made useful to the military as well. With the help of their expertise, we could design better tanks and create the factories necessary to produce them."
TRD_light_armour_experiments:0 "Pantser Experiments"
TRD_light_armour_experiments_desc:0 "While many may have seen tanks as useless in the past, tactics are changing in modern times, and with them priorities. To keep up with modern times we must evolve both our technology and tactics, and with it develop new hardware through experimentation."
TRD_heavy_plating:0 "Heavier Plating"
TRD_heavy_plating_desc:0 "While lighter models of tanks are useful against infantry, it is clear that against other armour or heavier fortification they are underwhelming. We need to design a heavier tank, with more tough and thick armour and a better build."
TRD_tank_production:0 "Mass Tank Production"
TRD_tank_production_desc:0 "Through our experimentation with tanks and our cooperation with our corporations, we have developed an extremely efficient method of producing tanks, with little wasted in time or resources."
TRD_speed_warfare:0 "Mobile Warfare"
TRD_speed_warfare_desc:0 "Tactics must change with the times, and it is clear to us that manuever is the way of the future. With more and more developments in vehicular warfare, it would be unwise for us to stick to the old tactics- we should begin shifting torwards a more modern way of thinking about war."
TRD_speed_cult:0 "The Cult of Speed"
TRD_speed_cult_desc:0 "Speed is everything in war- or so some in our military say. With our focus on manuever warfare we have also began to engrain the idea of the supremacy of speed in some, leading to them pushing the limits of our divisions and developing engenious ways to further the speed and reduce the logistical limits of our armies."
TRD_mass_combat:0 "Everyone Must Do Their Part"
TRD_mass_combat_desc:0 "While our economy is mighty, our army is not- we are a small nation surrounded by giants, with our backs to the sea. If we are to maintain our independence we need to focus on mobilising the masses in defense of their country, with propoganda promoting the common good of Skyfall."
TRD_citizen_soldiers:0 "The Citizen Soldier"
TRD_citizen_soldiers_desc:0 "We shall glorify the idea of the citizen soldier- of the common griffon who joins the fight for his country, fighting with fury for his homeland. And through this, the idea we propose shall become real in the hearts of the people, and therefore become a true reality."
TRD_expand_the_draft:0 "Autonomous Officers"
TRD_expand_the_draft_desc:0 "While the paradigm has long been that command structures should promote heirarchy, we have moved in the opposite direction. With our focus on the individual unit, whether armour or infantry, we have given more power to the individual officer than we have to the command structure which used to hold the army together. We must adapt and accept this change."
TRD_gun_factories:0 "Buyout Armouries"
TRD_gun_factories_desc:0 "There are many factories in our nation which could be of use to our burgeoning military, and yet are controlled by the private market- this can be fixed easily, with a few buyouts and a few encouragements to sell them."
TRD_doctrinal_development:0 "Doctrinal Development"
TRD_doctrinal_development_desc:0 "In the past our military doctrine has been unspectacular, a reflection of those around us rather than our own. However, with our recent developments we have began to create a doctrine which, while not unique to us, is in some ways our own, and with this we have began to explore the possibilities of our doctrine further, and should promote doing so."
TRD_spearhead:0 "The Spearhead"
TRD_spearhead_desc:0 "The concept of a spearhead, while not new, has been revolutionised by developments in armoured warfare and as such should be incorporated into our new doctrine, developing it further and making our offensive manuevers more effective."
TRD_guerilla_training:0 "Esprit De Corps"
TRD_guerilla_training_desc:0 "Comraderie, honor, duty- whatever it may be, the common spirit of our army must be promoted, so we shall have a unified and motivated fighting force prepared to fight."
TRD_support_squads:0 "Support Squads"
TRD_support_squads_desc:0 "With our focus on smaller entities within the army, the importance of support squads to help our divisions has become more important and so more resources should be put into developing new equipment and tactics for these support squads."
TRD_archibalds_knight:0 "The Freie Ritter"
TRD_archibalds_knight_desc:0 ""
TRD_archlights_mages:0 "Le Carnaval Magique"

TRD_centralised_command:0 "Centralised Command Structure"
TRD_centralised_command_desc:0 "To further the effectiveness of our army we first must strengthen our command structure, further centralising it and allowing for a better organised army. Though this may reduce our tactical flexibility, it is worth the cost."
TRD_massed_artillery:0 "An Endless Barrage"
TRD_massed_artillery_desc:0 "TRD_massed_artillery_desc:0 "Artillery has never failed us in the past, and as such we should focus more on it. Using our strong economy, we can create mass artillery which can overwhelm the enemy- our doctrine should be a reflection of this.""
TRD_overwhelming_firepower:0 "Overwhelming Firepower"
TRD_overwhelming_firepower_desc:0 "Why throw good griffons to their death when we could launch shells instead? By taking advantage of our economy to overwhelm the enemy with bombardment and bullets, we will not provide them any time to recover from our attacks- allowing us to easily defeat them."
TRD_trench_warfare_f:0 "The Classics"
TRD_trench_warfare_f_desc:0 "There's no need to fix what isn't broken- and the classical tactics of superior planning and preperation are the safest way to go, as a cunning plan can win many battles which seem lost."
TRD_a_plan_for_everything:0 "A Plan For Everything"
TRD_a_plan_for_everything_desc:0 "The great minds of our military staff will be forever at work, hatching plans for any scenario, no matter how unlikely- and through their engenuity we shall keep our nation prepared."
TRD_a_grand_army:0 "A Grand Army"
TRD_a_grand_army_desc:0 "Our army must be grand, and it must be organised- these two things are certain, and must be promoted above all else. For if the army falls into disarray, or there are no griffons to man the guns, nothing else will matter."
TRD_motorization_f:0 "Motorisation"
TRD_motorization_f_desc:0 "Warfare has always required flexibility, modern warfare more than ever. While infantry provide some of this, implementing motorised infantry either in support roles or in their own units will help to provide much-needed speed on the battlefield."
TRD_radio_implementation:0 "Radio Implementation"
TRD_radio_implementation_desc:0 "The radio is a marvelous invention, and perfect for our army. Through its use we can maintain our command over vast distances, and transfer information from one side of the country to the next. We need to take advantage of this at once, lest our enemies do so first."
TRD_complete_destruction:0 "Complete Annihilation"
TRD_complete_destruction_desc:0 "Our artillery will fill the skies, their steel rain supplied by the mighty industries of our nation. Never will the enemy be safe from our oppressive firepower, annihilating any resistance from our army's advance- or preventing any push into our homeland."
TRD_cryptography:0 "Dig In And Pray"
TRD_cryptography_desc:0 "Our infantry must always be prepared to dig entrenchments and follow orders, frontline engineers preparing fortifications as their officers plan for the next offensive."
TRD_artillery_construction:0 "The Lionwares Buyout"
TRD_artillery_construction_desc:0 "Lionwares Cannonry of Wonders, a company which produces, well, cannons- has quite a few factories. Factories with trained workers, specialised equipment, all of which would be perfect for our artillery guns- with a little persuasion and a good bit of money, we will be able to purchase this company for state use, and put it to use making our guns."
TRD_new_artillery:0 "Cannons of the Modern Age"
TRD_new_artillery_desc:0 "Our guns have become outdated, and this cannot do. We need to focus on updating our artillery in order to maintain a competetive fighting force, and not fall behind."
TRD_special_forces_initiative:0 "Taskforce 141"
TRD_special_forces_initiative_desc:0 "While our army is fine, it is lacking in divisions dedicated to specialised tasks. While we have some veteran marines, little else exists- this must change if we are to establish a further presence in the skies and sea."
TRD_rocket_artillery_f:0 "The Nebelwerfer"
TRD_rocket_artillery_f_desc:0 "The Nebelwerfer- a smoke mortar- is a hypothetical weapon idea that has been brought to us for further development. In concept used for throwing smoke shells, it also would be useful for everything from High Explosive rounds to different gas-based payloads."
TRD_mobile_artillery_batteries:0 "New Armouries"
TRD_mobile_artillery_batteries_desc:0 "Our old factories have served us well, but to take advantage of the new generation equipment we are developing we need to build new factories to produce them."
TRD_grifftonia_academy:0 "The West Beak Military Academy"
TRD_grifftonia_academy_desc:0 "As we develop our army, we need both to promote developments in our weaponry and tactics, as well as training new officers and soldiers. As such, the idea has been pitched for us to create a new military academy- one which could help train our officers and those creating new technologies for us to use."
TRD_magical_rifles:0 "The Power of Crystals"
TRD_magical_rifles_desc:0 "While magic technology has been mostly untapped in our army, there is a steady supply of crystals in the northern hills we could easily purchase for use. Magical weaponry might give us an edge over our enemies, and so the idea of developing our own magical rifles has been brought forth."

TRD_enhancing_our_prosperity:0 "Our Prosperous Little Nation"
TRD_enhancing_our_prosperity_desc:0 "The Chancellor has made his decision. With his ability to hold on to complete power fading, he has put his trust in the merchants which are the lifeblood of our society, in hopes of bringing further wealth and prosperity to our nation. His grip on the nation's politics remains strong however, and while he is around no transfer of power will be made, only concessions."
TRD_sell_unpforitable_businesses:0 "Liquidate Unprofitable Assets"
TRD_sell_unpforitable_businesses_desc:0 "Supporters of austerity have petitioned the government, claiming that unprofitable and useless assets are leading to economic issues for the state.

TRD_the_golden_standard:0 "The Golden Brand"

TRD_golden_griffon_cigars:0 "The Golden Griffon Cigarettes"
TRD_golden_griffon_cigars_desc:0 "Along with the many luxury goods we produce, cigarettes are one of our most popular exports. However, at the request of our 'friends', we have lifted some restrictions, leading to a further boom- primarily lead by Whitefeather, who has established a very popular cigarette line which customers cannot seem to stop buying."
TRD_the_pile_of_money:0 "Let the Money Flow"
TRD_the_pile_of_money_desc:0 "With our reforms completed and our capitalist allies sated, the Chancellor can finally rest and enjoy the fruit of his labor. With the economy booming and trade following suit, our nation is sure to grow to new heights in the world."

TRD_the_chancellors_authority:0 "Our Beloved Chancellor"
TRD_the_chancellors_authority_desc:0 "The fools of politics go on and discuss their plans, take from the poor give to the rich, take from the rich give to the poor. Guichard is sick of it all, let the fools blabber and talk. For the Iron Chancellor doesn't talk, he acts."
TRD_hunt_syndie_cells:0 "Hunt the Syndicalists"
TRD_hunt_syndie_cells_desc:0 "The Vakbonden threat has for a long time been a thorn in the side of Skyfall, and when you have a thorn stuck to your thigh you do not let it fester and get infected. You pull it out no matter the momentary pain, let the syndies run for the hills as we hunt them down."
TRD_bust_it_open:0 "Deal With the Ringleaders"
TRD_bust_it_open_desc:0 "The left screeches for the want of equality, the right screeches for the want of Boreas. Two chickens playing a dangerous game that ruins all it touches, but no more.

TRD_question_the_cabinet:0 "Close the Cabinet"

TRD_church_guards:0 "Watch the Temples"
TRD_church_guards_desc:0 "The Boreasiste have their safehouses in the temples, closing the doors and discussing how next to ruin the nation. You cannot break into the house of god, but you can watch it carefully. They have to come out sometime don't they, and when they do we simply arrest them."
TRD_hunt_borealistes:0 "Hunt Down Desramaux"
TRD_hunt_borealistes_desc:0 "The Boreasiste have now for a long time been advocating for a theocracy within Skyfall, lead by Gertjan Desramaux who is nothing more than a puppet of Eros that pleads for power and control.

TRD_the_death_of_guichard_desc:0 "With Guichard's death, the political landscape of Skyfall has been opened up for the first time since the Revolution. With the people sedated through the late Chancellor's donation, unrest that might come from such a change in power has been mostly avoided. With the office of chancellor now vacant, time will only tell who will take the Iron Chancellor's place."
TRD_the_industrialist:0 "The Captain of Industry"
TRD_the_industrialist_desc:0 "Heinrich Kessler, the most prominent industrialist in our city, is the most obvious candidate for chancellor. Dedicated to pushing industrial practices forward, he has become so dominant due to his innovative industrial tactics and focus on efficiency and precision."
TRD_synchronization:0 "Synchronization"
TRD_synchronization_desc:0 "Through carefully synchronizing every aspect of a production line, every aspect of production is improved; speed can be increased, there is not a need for as many workers, and less resources and time is wasted. By spreading this practice we can help improve our nation's industrial capacity."
TRD_precision:0 "Precision"
TRD_precision_desc:0 "Precision is extremely important in industry- no flaws are to be accepted in a self-respecting business. It is through this maxim that we will maintain our reputation as the producer of some of the finest goods in the world, and through which our industry will stay dominant."
TRD_specialization:0 "Specialization"
TRD_specialization_desc:0 "The modern production line, as utilised in our factories, cannot function unless specialised. Through specialisation we allow the same tasks to be performed repeatedly, allowing for standardized and quality products at an impressive rate of production- specialization will bring our industry to new heights."
TRD_a_living_wage:0 "A Living Wage"
TRD_a_living_wage_desc:0 "As our industry grows and more and more workers flood into our factories, the appeal of unions grows with them. While a more brash griffon might simply put these down with threats, our chancellor knows better. Through raising the wages of the workers to a more liveable sum, he will discourage the formation of unions and encourage company loyalty."
TRD_the_banker:0 "The Banker"
TRD_the_banker_desc:0 "Ferdinand von Hochsklaue is one of the most powerful griffons in the city of Skyfall, with heavy influences throughout the banking industry. Believing that the government's prime concern should be economic policy, and a firm believer in the power of money in politics, he promises a future of stability and wealth for the businesses of Skyfall to thrive in."
TRD_control_the_media:0 "The Political Machine"
TRD_control_the_media_desc:0 "With power achieved, we need to make moves to secure it. By setting up a hierarchy where lowlings are rewarded for helping our cause, all leading up to the chancellor himself, we can establish a solid political base."
TRD_fill_the_reserves:0 "Fill the Reserves"
TRD_fill_the_reserves_desc:0 "Our government is entirely reliant on the idol, and as such we need a safety net in case of a crisis.

TRD_rebuild_trust:0 "Into the World Once More"
TRD_rebuild_trust_desc:0 "With the death of the Iron Chancellor and von Hochsklaue's ascension to power, Skyfall is once again ready to face the world. Our government has stabilised and we have a bountiful treasury, both of which will help us maintain our secure position in the world."

This, von Hochsklaue believes, must be acknowledged- and only be acknowledging it can one truly understand our society. With his control of the idol, he truly controls the nation."
TRD_the_merc:0 "The Mercenary Lord"
TRD_the_merc_desc:0 "Hippolyte Bechard, a backhanded arms dealer with an impressive number of 'friends', is both powerful and dangerous.

TRD_old_friends:0 "Bechard Armurerie"

TRD_generous_donations:0 "Generous 'Donations'"
TRD_generous_donations_desc:0 "Bechard's profits do not usually come from 'legitimate' business, and this presents a problem for a supposedly righteous head of state- how is one to maintain a good reputation while their money comes from unreputable places? By routing illicitly gained funds through 'generous supporters' we can disguise them as donations- fooling the untrained eye."
TRD_sailor_lord:0 "The Skyfall Foreign Legion"
TRD_sailor_lord_desc:0 "While many griffons throughout Skyfall would like to join the army, the numbers are not high enough. While Skyfall already has a large immigrant population, by actively employing foreigners with generous pay into the Légion Étrangère, divisions comprised of both domestic and foreign recruits, we can bolster the size of our army."
TRD_robber_baron:0 "An Army For Hire"
TRD_robber_baron_desc:0 "With our army finally at a respectable size, and our payments to them leaving us as a loss, we must begin to put them to use.

TRD_the_kingpin:0 "The Kingpin"0
TRD_the_kingpin_desc:0 "Walter Whitefeather sits as the king of Skyfall's underground- he has subjugated the competition in his business and the late chancellor's generous reforms have allowed him to flourish even more. However, with the seat of power opening up, so does an opportunity- an opportunity for Skyfall to truly embrace the most profitable of business."
TRD_booze:0 "Branch Out"
TRD_booze_desc:0 "While drugs are highly profitable, they are not the best of vices for a growing society, nor the best business for expanding. Though the heart of his empire will always be narcotics, the chancellor has begun to expand into alcohol and smuggling, providing him a more stable base to fall back on and allowing him room to expand in other sectors."
TRD_control_the_underworld:0 "Control the Underworld"
TRD_control_the_underworld_desc:0 "With Whitefeather ascendant to power, he now has the ability to secure his base- the underworld. Though he already has a high level of control, there is still some competition, though they will not last long with his chancellorship. Once he has completely taken over the underworld, he will be prepared to make moves to secure his power over Skyfall in its entirety..."

Whitefeather and his adherents have made sure to be the ones knocking."
TRD_the_city:0 "The Biggest Little City in Griffonia"

TRD_the_finest_technicians:0 "The Finest Technicians"
TRD_the_finest_technicians_desc:0 "Though the practice of hiring foreigners to improve our products has already become commonplace, it has not been until our recent look outwards that we have managed to attract truely great minds. From across the world, we can attract finely skilled creatures to work on our products, to improve our reputation even more, and help us develop new innovations."
TRD_oil_experiments:0 "Black Gold"
TRD_oil_experiments_desc:0 "With Feathisia's bountiful oil fields lying just to our east, we have often looked on in envy. However, with our increased attention from foreign experts, an opportunity surfaces- the opportunity to invest into the brave frontier of synthetic fuel. Not only can we use this technology to supply our own country, we can sell our product to other countries, joining our neighbor in the great profits of the oil industry."
TRD_scientific_advancement:0 "Technocratic Principles"
TRD_scientific_advancement_desc:0 "Technology has brought Skyfall to great heights, allowing our businesses to flourish through innovation, and bringing us some of the first factories in griffonia under our prosperous capitalist system. We should embrace this and encourage technocratic principles and thinking in business and in our government, by promoting invention throughout the country."
TRD_war_is_a_racket:0 "War is a Racket"
TRD_war_is_a_racket_desc:0 "War may be hellish, but if it's going to rage anyways, why not profit off of it? With our armouries full of weapons and those of foreign nations empty, we should take advantage of this and sell our weapons to them at high but not unreasonable prices, sure to make us a nice profit."
TRD_industry_is_booming:0 "The Home of the Industrial Revolution"
TRD_industry_is_booming_desc:0 "Much of griffonia is still backwards, full of illiterates and without proper industry. However, Skyfall stands as a stark contrast to that- a mighty industrialised nation, no doubt due our unique capitalistic way of life. This early industrialisation has given us a leg up on the rest of Griffonia, and allowed our industry to flourish."
TRD_spending_spree:0 "A Haven for the Rich"
TRD_spending_spree_desc:0 "With most business-minded griffons either being trapped in wartorn countries or under the boots of aristocracy or socialists, Skyfall stands as a haven for these griffons. With our lax taxation and regulations, high promotion of business and position as the 'port of Griffonia', we will attract these griffons from across the continent, bringing their money and ideas with them."
TRD_the_busiest_ports:0 "The Busiest Ports"
TRD_the_busiest_ports_desc:0 "Our grand city is the crossroads between continents- much of the trade between continents and even on the continent flows through our docks and streets, and business across the world relies on us. Along with a myriad of other benefits, this has allowed our shipping industry to flourish and with it provided benefits to our navy."
TRD_state_farms:0 "Federal Farms"
TRD_state_farms_desc:0 "Though we have previously relied on imports to feed Skyfall, with our growing population we should look to reducing our reliance on foreign produce. The fertile and (relatively) unexploited lands in the rural areas around our cities are perfect for this. While they are currently occupied by inefficient family farms, we could aggressively buy up their land to create more efficient federal farmland, perfect to feed our growing city."
TRD_no_more_taxes:0 "Taxation is Theft"
TRD_no_more_taxes_desc:0 "Taxes have long been a great issue for honest businessgriffs such as our chancellor, the state stealing the work of its subjects, and for what? With some... encouragement from other business in Skyfall, we should work on reducing the state's reliance on this outdated system."
TRD_no_such_thing_as_jobless:0 "Work For Your Bread"
TRD_no_such_thing_as_jobless_desc:0 "There is no such thing as a free lunch- or atleast, there should not be. Though the spineless harmonists and radical communists may see charity as simply helping those in need, we see it as what it is- promoting lazyness and unemployment. By forcing these do-nothings to work for their food, we can help create a workforce to build up our great city, and stop letting these leeches drag our society down."
TRD_company_housing:0 "Company Housing"
TRD_company_housing_desc:0 "Though landlords still dominate much of the housing industry in our country, there are more efficienct ways to organise things. By promoting the use of company-provided housing, workers will be more efficiently organised and our business will benefit from more control over their employees."
TRD_import_workers:0 "A New Workforce"
TRD_import_workers_desc:0 "With our workforce growing both as eager to work immigrants arrive and more griffons take up even more work, our nation prospers. With companies being forced to pay less and having high levels of control over their workers, Skyfall is growing quickly and so are its businesses. We have defined a new way to organise labor, perfect to help our nation thrive."
TRD_capital_of_the_world:0 "Come On Down to Skyfall!"
TRD_capital_of_the_world_desc:0 "With our chancellor's most important reforms complete, Skyfall has emerged from the power vacuum with a new, prosperous path.

TRD_cat_base_strike_f:0 "Horst's Naval Aviation"

TRD_naval_planes_f:0 "The Naval Aviation Department"
TRD_naval_planes_f_desc:0 "In accordance with Whitefeather's plan, we need to focus not only on developing superior ships, but also on the planes to fit them. We need to create bombers which can more easily be used on carriers and in naval combat, to take full advantage of our new naval direction."
TRD_heavy_cruiser_f:0 "Heavier Cruisers"
TRD_heavy_cruiser_f_desc:0 "Cruisers, while not as strong as battleships, are still useful and should not be overlooked. By developing a new line of especially heavy cruisers, we can support our main fleet with less expensive but still effective heavy ships."
TRD_destroyer_f:0 "Patrol Boats"

TRD_expand_skyfall_dockyards_desc:0 "While we have updated our ships, we still need the shipyards to produce them. We need larger ports, greater production and more funding for our naval construction to develop a fleet to truely wrest control of the waves."
TRD_carrier_experiments:0 "Finish the Guichard Plan"
TRD_carrier_experiments_desc:0 "Time has come to complete the chancellor's plan, focused on modernising Skyfall's carrier fleet to make it competetive in modern naval combat.

TRD_heavier_guns:0 "Fourty Centimeters of Destruction"
TRD_heavier_guns_desc:0 "Our new ships need new guns to go with them, and so we need to modernise our weaponry as well. With the development of a strong 40cm battery to fit our ships, we will make sure that our ships have guns strong enough to compete."
TRD_extra_heavy_armour:0 "Enchanted Plating"
TRD_extra_heavy_armour_desc:0 "A rather novel idea combining griffon magic of enchanted machinery and new magical technology, it has been suggested by some that we could enchant the plating of our ships to make them more resistant to fire. While an unconventional idea, it may very well be useful."

TRD_the_new_admirality_desc:0 "With our expanding navy, we must also develop the officer corps which will lead our ships.

TRD_submarine_experiments:0 "The U-Boat"

TRD_drills:0 "The Long Lance"

TRD_heavy_fighter_f_desc:0 "While our current fighters function fine, it may be possible for us to improve them.

At some point, I simply had enough- I stormed out of the meeting, determined to get some fresh air, some room to think for once. However, I was soon interrupted by my naive niece, Genevieve. She came to me with a call to help the "common folk" of Skyfall, who were ailing while the merchants profitted. My mind was reeling from the arguments of the night, and I could not take it anymore- something must be done."

Primarily from Griffonia, though with a minority coming from the west, these migrants vary, from unskilled laborers to skilled technicians and engineers. The latter group has grown to be especially of interest to our industrialists, who have began to hire foreign technicians to improve their products. While this is much to the dismay of the domestic griffons who believe their jobs are being stolen, you have kept your position firm and not surrendered to their protests. With this action we have allowed our industry to grow to new heights in reputation, and Skyfall's goods are gaining a reputation for being extremely well-designed. This practice has been especially adopted by Heinrich Kessler, an innovative industrialist who has used this foreign talent to bring new innovations to his industrial empire."

Nonetheless, you have kept a cool head, and taken time to consider their demands, however greedy. While submitting to every demand of the petty capitalists would just undermine your power, by strategically providing grants to those who support you, you will maintain your power base, while at the same time helping the city's industry- a plan that you eventually decided on, after much consideration."

As the news spread to griffons throughout Skyfall, the nation's politics have come to a standstill.\n\n This was not the first time this had happened- the Chancellor has faked his death numerous times in the past, leaving many to have doubts about whether he was truely dying or not, thinking he was once again attempting to drag his enemies out of the shadows.\n\n As the city lies in stasis, awaiting the verdict, the Chancellor was busy hastily writing out a will. Though the doctors were not sure when he would die, they were sure that he did not have long to live- even the best medicine in Griffonia could not keep him alive. And so, on his deathbed, the Chancellor's iron talon loosened for the final time, and Skyfall's fate no longer was his to decide."

To some dismay from the ruling classes, the Chancellor's will has been enforced, and his great wealth has been spread among the residents of Skyfall. Due to the Chancellor's unexpected death, and firm authority over the nation's politics, a successor had not been officially declared prior to his death. However, with the only powerful griffons left in the city being the oligarchs who ruled the city's business, it was clear to most who would inherit the city."

They would hold to their promises to the people and hold a conference of any Griffon who wished to come to Skyfall to make their case on the government of the new Skyfall. Though before it even began, three candidates seemed to be in the head of the race.\n\nFirst is Growder of the Centralisten faction of the Vakbonden. A powerful orator, he has advocated the strengthening of the post of Chairgriffon and for the comprehensive planning of the economy by the state, which gives him strong support amongst the new Army and Navy.\n\n Second is De Altesburg of the RSP. An advocate of Social democracy he is the most moderate of the three candidates and has the support of whatever remains of the bourgeoisie in Skyfall along with those who might not fully support this whole "Communism" thing.\n\nLast is Rosebeak of the primary, syndicalist faction. While he is generally in the center of the debate between Growder and De Altesburg, all Griffons know he will not "compromise". He is an advocate of traditional anarcho-syndicalist ideas and wishes to put the unions in charge of the entire nation as the national government."

As the big three all come forward with their own plans, this one will be a slugger.\n\nFirstly, Growder comes forward with his plan to centralize and control the economy through mass-nationalization of industry and resources. This has strong support from the military who could easily benefit from the nationalization of resources.\n\nSecondly is Rosebeak. He speaks of a traditional anarcho-syndicalist economy but in a way that has never been tried, he wishes for everything to be unionized, down to the very core of society and economics. This of course earns the support of the unions and many militias thoughout the nations.\n\nLastly is De Altesburg who unlike the others has delivered no firey speeches about his economic policy, he has simply written it out and presented it to the congress. Befitting of his demenour the plan is one that is extremely moderate compared to his opponents, advocating for a market economy with limited private ownership while still maintaining many of the union values of Rosebeak's plan. This has the support of those involved in the professions of trade before the revolution and the many more moderates unions and those who's success relies on trade.\n\nHow shall Skyfall's economy be run?"

For once Rosebeak and Growder seem to be on the same side, with both being set against the RSP. The conflict arose over how Skyfall should prosecute revolutions in other Griffonian states. Rosebeak and Growder are full heartingly behind the idea of expanding the revolution while De Altesburg has called for patience and caution.\n\nIn any other circumstance the great revolutionary fervour would have easily overwhelmed the calls for peace, but the revolution is still in recent memory. While the arguement for the revolution is generally stronger on the surface, many in the Army and Navy have cautioned Growder to simply fall behind the RSP on this one as they do not feel ready, and many unionshave told Rosebeak it could ruin them if war was to come to early.\n\nHow shall Growder and Rosebeak vote?"

tradefed.58.d:0 "In the final week over the congress the greatest debate has emerged, the debate over the power of the griffon to be elected by this congress. How much power should he hold over the state? Now of course with the autocracy of the Iron Chancellor in recent memory, no griffon will ever have total control, but the arguements keep flaring.\n\nGrowder argues that the Chairgriffon needs expansive powers in order to protect the state from the evils of capitalism and monarhcy. He says that the Chairgriff's sacred responsability to defend the people must have no obsticles in his way.\n\nOn the oppisite end Rosebeak denounces Growder as a tyrant and a demagogue and has argued that the powers of the chairgriff should be limited and that power should be held by a legislature of union representatives. And that the chairgriff should only act as a figurehead to guide the people.\n\nAt the end of the congress, wanting to avoid hostilities after its conclusion, De Altesburg proposed his own plan. One that would give the Chairgriff the same powers as any other member of the assembly of unions proposed by Rosebeak, while also granting the post the powers as the head of the military, a major point made by Growder's army and Navy backers.\n\nWho convinces the most griffs?"

Stepping onto the podium outside one of the counters adjusted his glasses and began to read from the notecard in front of him:\n\n"Citizens of Skyfall,  it has been our honor and duty to tally the votes of your representatives and declare who shall serve you as your first Chairgriffon. And so without further delay, the first Chairgriffon of Skyfall" He pauses for just half a second and takes a breath, not long enough fr anyone to notice, but just long enough to put suspence into the air. "is Adalbert Growder. Congradulations to all the candida..."\n\nNot one heard to rest of his speech. In the center of the plaza Growder's supporters began to chant their signiture sloga "Louder for Growder!". It drove some insane but it was a strong rallying cry for a griffon with that same personality, a roaring crowd hyped up on revolutionary fervor. From the stage the counter could see Rosebeak walking away from the plaza, not so much dissapointed in his loss, but dissapointed in Skyfall. De Altesburg had walked over to congradulate Growder, always the gentleman he was. But Growder? His reaction was an anomoly. He was crying. This firey and abrasive man was now crying tears of joy in the center of Skyfall. And the counter had hope for the future."

As the stage was thrown down for him, people began to gather; shocked by this appearance of the leader of their nation. And so he began to speak. He railed against the oligarchs who had used this port to escape revolutionarly justice, spoke ill of those who would let Skyfall fall to "corrupting influences" and made sure to get the crowd as riled up as possible. Whipping them into a frenzy, so vicious many doubted who they had supported only a month or two before. A populist campaign lead by a populist griffon.\n\nAnd in the halls of government many birds begin to grumble as they feel threatened by Growder's campaign of public anger..."

But many have lost their idealism and are quick to take the proposal put before them. And slowly, as the council reconvenes, more and more griffs begin to vote with the centralizing of Skyfall's government, into positions then handed out to those same voters...\n\nBut somegriff let the secret out. Fringe Harmonist newspapers run stories of corruption, and politicians begin to get angry as this new voting block begins to pass further reforms..."

And now it is Growder's turn.\n\nAs Growder walked along the piers of Skyfall city, newly repaired after the chaos of revolutionary struggle; he saw his old friend, captain Veren Regeling, in command of one of the nation's greatest battlecruisers. And while he passed, this griffon and his sailors did something that hadn't been done since the days of the Oligarchs.\n\nThey fired off the ship's guns in the form of a salute to Growder's presence. In the days following this event, Growder made many more appearances alongside the navy, with them showing their support for his increases in their funding, and their role as protectors of the new state.\n\nAnd in the shadows, many griffons began to worry what this militarism would mean."

They are all aware of the issue, Growder's opposition is angered, and if it reaches a high point, they could even try to remove him from his post. A plan is formed in hushed whispers, and the griffs return to their homes. But this night will be without sleep for all of them.\n\nThe following day a bill is submitted to the council, a law so staggering that a split has been forced. You are either with Growder or against him.\n\nCalled the Machtigingswet, it decrees that the nation is being held back by traitors within the ranks of its government, and that the chairgriffon has the right and duty to weed them out. Giving Growder unrivaled power to reshape the government and the nation as he pleases.\n\nWhether out of belief or fear of having their positions taken away, one by one griffons cast their votes for the bill until it passes by a two-vote margin."

Unfit for the new revolutionary society.\n\nSquads of Revolutionaire Bewakers roam the streets, looking for new pieces of the old to burn to make way for the new. Throw something out on the street quickly when they come, lest your house be ransacked.\n\nAnd in his office, the Chairgriff sits, looking down upon the bonfire, waiting patiently for the old reactionary society to be turned to ash. \n\nAshes to Ashes..."

And yet, in a conference room, several influential party members have gathered. Curtains have been drawn. Then, the Chairgriff speaks up.\n\n“Comrades, the Revolution is threatened. Boreaists have organized and hide within the party,” He says.\n\nCries of “Impossible!” and “Preposterous” fill the air in the room, some of them having been part of the revolution ever since it had to hide under the Chancellor and before that even.\n\n“But fret not Comrades. Our Bewakers have been hard at work the last few months rooting out the corruption within. They have arrested reactionaries, some of them working deep, deep undercover” He says as he circles the table.\n\nHe comes to a stop, as he stands before a great wooden door. “In fact, there are only a few reactionaries remaining. Those who sook to keep us divided while they worked on crushing the workers under their claws.”\n\nOpening the door, he shouts “Bewakers! Take these to the cells!” The heavily armed Bewakers stream in, grabbing the ‘traitors’ by their neckfeathers and dragging them out, despite protests. The reactionaries have been crushed. Everything is now serving the revolution."

Those in the party, that wanted to form a counterrevolutionary movement have been discovered, rooted out, to make sure that they will not be able to bring back the Chancellor’s rule. However, now, we must turn to the future as a new dawn rises on Skyfall. We must now remove the last traces of the Old Republic and proclaim a new People’s Republic, where the Party takes the decisions on behalf of everyone.

Emerging from the hull, was a frail old figure, but one of a changeling, a new sight to many in the city. By a stroke of luck, one of the colonels there that day spoke extremely fluid Herzlander, and had done personal research into the similarities between it and the Changeling mother tongue and so was able to translate. And wow. Did he have a story to tell...\n\nHe had begun his journey fighting a guerilla war against Queen Chrysalis' forces before retreating into the northern mountains and being hunted by Jaeger troops, he marched long and hard through Yakyakistan and parts of the Griffon frontier with his group of faithful followers, all to reach his end destination. Great Stalliongrad.\n\nBut he was sorely dissapointed...  As when he did reach that city, he was horrified. He found a political system ripe with corruption and infighting with self-serving politicians who had forgotten the true idea of the revolution. But he decided that he had gone long enough, why not go a bit farther? He and his followers found an old, rusty, dilapidated oil tanker on the shores of St. Petershoof, and managed to set it a sail.

tradefed.112.a:0 "His final act..."
#chancelor is dead. It's harmony time#
tradefed.113.t:0 "The Blowback"
tradefed.113.d:0 "With the Iron Chancellor's death, the enemies he made with his recent reforms have come out of hiding, ready to strike. Businesses, primarily those of the powerful oligarchs of the city, have began to boycott the new government, accusing both Guichard and the new chancellor, Genevieve, of "selling out to the syndicates" and "betraying free market ideals". The selfish oligarchs have shut down our industry and banking systems, holding the nation hostage until they get what they desire- that is, power and a rollback of our recent reforms. Even worse, crime has taken a massive spike as pirates and thugs have come out of hiding, on the orders of crime-lords who know their time is near. If the chancellor is to continue her ambitious reforms and continue helping her nation's people, she must first neuter the oligarchs and show that she has inherited her uncle's iron will..."
tradefed.113.a:0 "Like a gaggle of children!"

tradefed.114.t:0 "Dockyard Woes"
tradefed.114.d:0 "To even begin to stop the pirates who now plague our waters, we need to secure a power base to defeat them from- and where better than our docks? Though the pirates use intimidation and fear to attempt to control the workers, by generously bribing those who work in the dockyards we can hopefully prevent the outlaws from gaining ground, and build support in the workers there."
tradefed.114.a:0 "It's a start, atleast"

tradefed.115.t:0 "The Inside Job"
tradefed.115.d:0 "The pirates are no exception to the chaos which plagues our city, and as such their leadership and security is very loose. With our bribes working finely, this is a perfect opportunity to send loyal informants and saboteurs into the ranks of the smugglers and pirates, letting us learn of their methods and disrupt their activities."
tradefed.115.a:0 "Now we wait"

tradefed.116.t:0 "Smugglers Apprehended"
tradefed.116.d:0 "The ambush was a great success, and with the help of our informants the police have apprehended a crew of smugglers, along with their illicit goods. With a little 'convincing' from our police, we will be able to gain valuable information, as well as prove a message to the outlaws that we are not clawless..."
tradefed.116.a:0 "Beat it out of them, if need-be..."

tradefed.117.t:0 "The Vice Tightens"
tradefed.117.d:0 "The orders have been sent, and our police have taken to the streets, enforcing order- especially in the docks and areas nearby, where the activity of smugglers and pirates was most rampant. This move was, luckily, a success, and we have regained nominal control. Though this is not the end of the fight against the outlaws, it is a gesture to both our people and the criminals that we are prepared to keep the peace."
tradefed.117.a:0 "I want patrols on every street!"

tradefed.118.t:0 "The Death of a Mercenary"
tradefed.118.d:0 "One prominent griffon and officer in our army, affectionately known to many as "Little Busta", has for long been associated with mercenary groups, and been somewhat friendly to smugglers, but with our recent fight against similary aligned groups, it is time to handle things. By arranging a convenient accident to deal with this loose end and some of his , we can make sure he won't cause any trouble in the future."
tradefed.118.a:0 "An ode to rats"

tradefed.119.t:0 "No More Hiding"
tradefed.119.d:0 "Our preperations are ready, and it is time to set out to destroy the bandits once and for all. We have mapped out their dens, prepared our police for the raids and made moves to sabotage their defenses. The Chancellor just needs to say the word, and our plans will be set in motion..."
tradefed.119.a:0 "Almost there..."

tradefed.120.t:0 "The Death of a Pirate"
tradefed.120.d:0 "Our police have finally tracked down Bechard's hiding place- yet another smuggler den. After a bloody battle with some of his heavily armed escorts, our police finally made it to the room where he was hiding, aiming at the door with a pistol- he was immediately shot down, before he could pull the trigger."
tradefed.120.a:0 "Au revoir you Aquileian bastard"

tradefed.121.t:0 "Genevieve's Speech"
tradefed.121.d:0 "The burden of responsibility has suddenly been cast apon the young Genevieve, and yet she bears it stoically- determined to prove to her nation and the world that she is prepared to transform Skyfall into a modern state, and to uplift her people, she has urgently prepared a speech. Addressing the nervous crowds on a dreary city morning, she boldly proclaimed her ambitions to take back the city from the traitorous snakes who wish to take it for themselves, and to restore Skyfall's prosperity- not for the sake of the capitalists, but for the sake of the people. She has also openly stated wishes to cooperate with both the church and the socialist movements in the city against their common enemy. As her speech came to a close, she went off script, beginning to speak of her dream for Skyfall- a nation where people can be free and prosperous, without treacherous monopolists holding it back- a nation that can truly call itself the shining gem of Griffonia. While this speech has been controversial, most especially among hardline capitalists and reactionaries, it has helped to encourage the people of Skyfall to hold out for a better future, and has won over some within the church and labor movements, making cooperation more likely."
tradefed.121.a:0 "To a better Skyfall!"

tradefed.122.t:0 "A Meeting With Girard"
tradefed.122.d:0 "The meeting of our chancellor and Girard, one of the forefront griffons of the Vakbond, has been awaited with bated breath by prominent citizens both in our government and the labor movement itself- and the day has finally arrived. Meeting on Girard's terms, the chancellor arrived with hopes to mend relations between labor and government, promising concessions if they were to pledge support to her government. Much to the chagrin of the revolutionary left, Genevieve and Girard left the meeting having come to an agreement, on the chancellor's terms. This has caused a mass exodus of revolutionaries from the Vakbond Raad, who believe Girard to be a traitor to true socialist ideals, but it has also attracted many workers to the new more moderate interpretation of the party- one that has pledged its support to Genevieve against the capitalists."
tradefed.122.a:0 "I'm glad we could see eye to eye"

tradefed.123.t:0 "A Meeting With the Clergy"
tradefed.123.d:0 "The chancellor and several representatives of our government have finally met with a group of prominent clergy officials, wishing to forge and agreement with our government. While many support the Parti Boreasiste out of principle, they have made their disagreements with the radical Desramaux clear- and have come up with an agreement. They will support Genevieve's government on the terms that she allows the Parti Boreasiste to operate freely- under the leadership of the more moderate and cooperative Julia Van Tieghem. Along with several other minor concessions to the church, this agreement has been decided on, and so the clergy of our city are now in support of our government."
tradefed.123.a:0 "Glad we could come to an agreement"

tradefed.124.t:0 "The United Front"
tradefed.124.d:0 "This day marks the official rise of the united front- a loose alliance of the HP, Vakbonden and Boreasiste in support of Genevieve's government. United by their hatred of the petty capitalists who have brought our nation to ruin, with their support our government has gained much more legitimacy and support, opening the way to squash the snakes who have taken our nation hostage."
tradefed.124.a:0 "Together to victory!"

tradefed.125.t:0 "An Honest Accident"
tradefed.125.d:0 "With our plans set in motion, loyalists working within Kessler's factories have made necessary preperations, and on our commands a series of 'accidents' occured, creating a major yet also temporary setback for his production. More important is the disruption it has caused in his supporters, with workers wondering about his safety standards and outside supports having second thoughts about his competence."
tradefed.125.a:0 "Accidents happen"

tradefed.126.t:0 "News Just In"
tradefed.126.d:0 "With information gathered by our informants, many Skyfall news publications have been making public information the oligarchs would rather not- and so rumor has become fact. While there is still some question to the validity of the information, and some cry out that it is slander at the hands of political opponents, this has caused a stir within the public, with some prominent figures renouncing their support in response."
tradefed.126.a:0 "That has to hurt..."

tradefed.127.t:0 "The Grand Heist"
tradefed.127.d:0 "In a shocking turn of events, one of the greatest banks in Skyfall has been robbed blind- a group of mysterios griffons working for an unknown group have managed to secure much of the wealth inside for themselves and whoever they work for, at the same time weakening the bankers in control... In unrelated news, a very generous donation has recently been made to our government."
tradefed.127.a:0 "Good work!"

tradefed.128.t:0 "The Associates"
tradefed.128.d:0 "We have contacted several business associates of the oligarchs, many of whom have began to question their leadership. With the promise of idols and protection from government action, our plan has worked, and many have renounced their loyalty and turned to our side. This is yet another blow to the oligarchs..."
tradefed.128.a:0 "I'm glad we could reach an agreement"

tradefed.129.t:0 "Bail Them Out"
tradefed.129.d:0 "While our actions have caused some within the leftern wing of the united front to question our motives, our government has bailed out many of the smaller industrialists and bankers who had come on hard times following our sabotage. With this, we have won our government their support, and weakened our opposition- we are almost ready to finally take back Skyfall."
tradefed.129.a:0 "Think nothing of it"

tradefed.130.t:0 "The New Deal"
tradefed.130.d:0 "With many of their former supporters pledging loyalty to our government, and their business going downhill with recent "unfortunate events", Kessler and Ferdinand von Hochsklaue have officially announced their support to the government, and stopped resisting our new chancellor and come running back to our government with their tails between their legs. With this, we have the cards in our hand- and we can deal with the issue of monopoly once and for all.\n\n With recent legislation, the greatest threats within the business sector of Skyfall have been signifigantly weakened, with their political power reduced and protections put against future monopolies being created. With this we have finally destroyed an issue that has plagued Skyfall for decades, securing the power of the federal government above capital."
tradefed.130.a:0 "Run along now, I have a country to run"

tradefed.131.t:0 "The War On Crime"
tradefed.131.d:0 "With increases to funding and more ambitious deployment plans in our police force, it is official- we have began a war on crime. With these increased efforts being noticed by the crime lords, they have retaliated, and it is clear that we must continue our hardline approach to smash these petulant criminals."
tradefed.131.a:0 "The die is cast"

tradefed.132.t:0 "Arresting the Dealers"
tradefed.132.d:0 "All must start somewhere, and if we are to handle this issue we should attack their revenue stream- primarily drugs. Though we do not have enough information or resources to take on their dens and production, by arresting petty street dealers we can atleast take care of the worst of it, somewhat reducing the profits of the organisations at large."
tradefed.132.a:0 "It's a start..."

tradefed.133.t:0 "Cracking the Dens"
tradefed.133.d:0 "Our police have been given orders to search for drug dens and break them up, further escalating the war on drugs. Though some grumble about civil liberties, this program has been mostly a success, and we have managed to crack down on the worst crime in many lower income neighborhoods. This is another step to a safe and crime-free Skyfall."
tradefed.133.a:0 "Less drugs on the street"

tradefed.134.t:0 "The War Intensifies"
tradefed.134.d:0 "The chancellor has made official statements to the police encouraging a more hardline approach to crime, and has replaced leadership with those more cooperative to these efforts. With this new leadership the police have been stirred into action, causing some controversy both within and outside of the force itself, but also proving that the government will stick by its guns on the issue of crime."
tradefed.134.a:0 "No more half measures!"

tradefed.135.t:0 "The Source"
tradefed.135.d:0 "Our police have arrived at the various labs throughout our nation armed with more than normal weapons- on official orders by both the chancellor and the chief of police, along with securing the labs from the criminals, they have also been ordered to scorch and destroy as much equipment, product and supplies as possible, making sure that even if they manage to recover their hideouts they cannot use them, and sending a very clear message."
tradefed.135.a:0 "Burn it all!"

tradefed.136.t:0 "Dealing With The Pushers"
tradefed.136.d:0 "Our police have apprehended many of the pushers supplying the city-side dealers, and more are on the way. With these arrests we have majorly hurt the bottom line of the gangs these pushers work for, giving us even more of an upper hand..."
tradefed.136.a:0 "One less threat to the establishment"

tradefed.137.t:0 "The End Of the Road"
tradefed.137.d:0 "With his criminal empire crumbling before him, Whitefeather had taken to a bold move in an attempt to recover, personally taking part in a raid on a prominent rival gang- though this was a success on his part, he lost many men in the raid- and worse, attracted the police. While him and his men fled the scene before police could arrive, our forces tracked him down to one of the few labs left in the countryside nearby the city, charging in with guns drawn prepared to finally take down the larger than life griffon- only to find him dead on the floor from a gunshot sustained in the raid. With his death his already weakening empire has come to an end, and our police can take care of the few straggling, weak gangs."
tradefed.137.a:0 "That's all she wrote, folks"

tradefed.138.t:0 "A New Dawn"
tradefed.138.d:0 "With the final victory over the oligarchs and criminals who had attempted to take control of our city, the people of Skyfall can rest easy. The city is once again in the care of the chancellor, who now wishes to finally accomplish her plans- to give power to the citizens of Skyfall, and to share the wealth of the capitalists to the common folk."
tradefed.138.a:0 "Long live Skyfall!"

tradefed.139.t:0 "Spring Cleaning"
tradefed.139.d:0 "The trade council had finally been destroyed. An instutition in place since Guichard's rise to power, it represented the influence of business on government, a power which had been around since Skyfall's time in the empire. With its destruction came the final message that Skyfall's capitalists had been tamed- they no longer were the masters of the people of Skyfall."
tradefed.139.a:0 "And thus it ends"

tradefed.140.t:0 "New Voting Laws"
tradefed.140.d:0 "The people of Skyfall have long yearned for democracy, or, atleast, Genevieve believes so- but even if they did not yearn in the past, the rejoice surrounding its creation could not be imaginary. With voting laws in place and the government becoming more democratic, the people of Skyfall have celebrated the new free government, a beacon of freedom on Griffonia."
tradefed.140.a:0 "Long live democracy!"

### Leader Descriptions ###
blizz_blizz_desc:0 "A privileged mare of unmatched sophistication, Arclight de Liny was born in a noble family in Aquila's pony district. Her doting parents encouraged her interest in the art of war, particularly the military application of magic, but her studies were halted by the outbreak of the 980 ALB Aquileian Revolution. Her family's monarchist loyalties meant they were no longer safe in their home, and they fled over the seas to Equestria. Life in Equestria was good for Arclight, but also unimaginably boring and she wished to leave. Gathering a group of aristocratic ponies who also fled the Revolution, they've assembled Le Carnival Magique, an elite company of mages known for their dazzling spells and willingness to fight for the highest bidder. Arclight's signature képi ensures she stands out wherever the road leads."
angry_trade_bird_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 15 of March, 914 in Skyfall City\n\n§YNickname§!: The Most Hated Griffon in Griffonia\n\n§YBiography§!: Ghislain Guichard was born sixth child to his mother Eva, a Feathesian noblewoman and his father a prominent industrialist. When he was young Guichard did well in school, particularly in regards to mathematics where he seemed to hold a personal love. Being the sixth son meant that no one believed that Guichard would gain much of an inheritance from his father, and so some pushed him to join the imperial army as many noble children do. But this was not to be Guichard's fate in life. When he was twenty-four, and just out of studying at Romau university, Guichard asked his father's permission to take over the running of an unprofitable cloth mill that the family-owned in the countryside, and had planned to shut down. His father instead loaned his son the money to buy the factory from him and made him pay off the debt. Guichard threw himself into his work and began his efforts on getting the factory in order. Within a year, he had paid back his father's loan and shown his financial genius to the world. Soon enough, he was buying up smaller facilities in the countryside and consolidating his financial power. One by one he even bought out his brothers, showing a complete disregard for such weak concepts as "family", preferring to indulge in the pursuit of money instead.\n\nWhile the whole of Skyfall knew Guichard the businessgriff, they were about to meet a side to him that might have been even scarier. For in 977, Guichard got himself elected the Mayor of Skyfall. Always austere, he immediately began to roll back privileges for many Imperial nobles and members of the military. Leading to Griffenheim more than once threatening to revoke Skyfall's charter as a free city. But everything changed in 978. When Kemerskai launched his coup in Griffenheim, none of the powerful in Skyfall were truly on his side. But popular uprisings in the city worried many, and with the Imperial military unable to aid the city, Guichard Embarked on a daring plan. Contacting the local republicans in Skyfall he expressed sypathies for their cause and told them how he could assist in taking control of the Imperial fleet. After the republicans had done the deed, Guichard sent in a group of mercenaries and slaughtered them all. Followed by declaring Skyfall's secession from the Empire, and independence from the Republic.\n\nNow of course no one believed the trade city would simply survive by itself.  That was illegal... wasn't it? But Guichard cared not. And would rule with an Iron fist unrivaled across Griffonia, guiding Skyfall still to this day when he is 93 years of age.\n\nBut he can't be immortal... Can he?\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

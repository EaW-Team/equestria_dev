TRD_the_iron_chancellor:0 "The Iron Chancellor"
TRD_the_iron_chancellor_desc:0 "When the Republican Uprising threw the Griffonian Empire into chaos, Skyfall, the Imperial Fleet's main naval base, threatened to get ruined in the ensuing anarchy.  Fortunately, Chancellor Guichard's decisive action saved the city from the ruin and conflict that consumed the heart of the Empire. The griffon assumed full and absolute control over Skyfall, but his firm claw guided the city away from the brink of destruction.\n\nIn the years that followed, Guichard ruthlessly crushed any opposition to his rule, both from Republican hopefuls and Imperial loyalists, earning him the nickname of 'Iron Chancellor'. However, his clear vision and indominable purpose managed to not only secure Skyfall's sovereignty, but turn it into an oasis of peace and prosperity in the war-torn lands of Griffonia. Although the light in his eyes still shine brightly, the iron chancellor is getting rusty, leaving many to fear for Skyfall's future."
TRD_the_riches_of_skyfall:0 "The Biggest Little City in Griffonia"
TRD_the_riches_of_skyfall_desc:0 "Just as Griffenheim is the proud political heart of Griffonia, and Griffonstone its ancient spiritual heart, Skyfall is the bustling heart of trade on the continent. Vessels from all four corners of our planet find their way to our harbour, where merchants buy the bulk of the goods to be distributed throughout the Heartlands.\n\nMany of the more exotic artifacts and produce is sold directly in the crowded shopping streets and market squares of the city. And any being who visits our city will marvel at the sheer diversity of peoples and wares that Skyfall offers, instilling desires they didn't know they could have. Of course, what is bought and sold in the city ultimately matters little, as long as a portion of that unfathomable wealth reaches our treasury."
TRD_social_inequality:0 "Social Inequality"
TRD_social_inequality_desc:0 "While Skyfall has, for the most part managed to avoid the issues that plague the rest of Griffonia, its unique way of governing is not without its flaws. Although embracing capitalism has made Skyfall incredibly wealthy, its prosperity has not been distributed evenly across the population of the Federation.\n\nWithout any restrictions to trade, local manufacturing and agriculture have the impossible task of competing with the entire world. Many non-trading businesses failed, leaving many griffons without a livelihood, especially outside of Skyfall itself. This social and economic inequality will continue to take its toll on the populace, until some sort of solution is found."

TRD_pirate_idea:0 "Rampant Piracy"

Other more savvy ones are simply pouncing on any opportunities available to make bank and flee before the Guildedwing reforms are enacted.

### Focuses ###
#Normal MIlitary#
TRD_decentralised_command:0 "Decentralised Command Structure"
TRD_decentralised_command_desc:0 "Some griffons, both in the army and out, have began to promote the idea of a less centralised army. While this would reduce our army's effectiveness overall, it would both allow more fluid tactics on the individual level as well as paving the way for new tactics."
TRD_motor_factories:0 "The Orthos Contract"
TRD_motor_factories_desc:0 "Orthos Motors, one of the most prominent companies in their market, could be made useful to the military as well. With the help of their expertise, we could design better tanks and create the factories necessary to produce them."
TRD_light_armour_experiments:0 "Pantser Experiments"
TRD_light_armour_experiments_desc:0 "While many may have seen tanks as useless in the past, tactics are changing in modern times, and with them priorities. To keep up with modern times we must evolve both our technology and tactics, and with it develop new hardware through experimentation."
TRD_heavy_plating:0 "Heavier Plating"
TRD_heavy_plating_desc:0 "While lighter models of tanks are useful against infantry, it is clear that against other armour or heavier fortification they are underwhelming. We need to design a heavier tank, with more tough and thick armour and a better build."
TRD_tank_production:0 "Mass Tank Production"
TRD_tank_production_desc:0 "Through our experimentation with tanks and our cooperation with our corporations, we have developed an extremely efficient method of producing tanks, with little wasted in time or resources."
TRD_speed_warfare:0 "Mobile Warfare"
TRD_speed_warfare_desc:0 "Tactics must change with the times, and it is clear to us that maneuver is the way of the future. With more and more developments in vehicular warfare, it would be unwise for us to stick to the old tactics- we should begin shifting towards a more modern way of thinking about war."
TRD_speed_cult:0 "The Cult of Speed"
TRD_speed_cult_desc:0 "Speed is everything in war- or so some in our military say. With our focus on maneuver warfare we have also began to engrain the idea of the supremacy of speed in some, leading to them pushing the limits of our divisions and developing ingenious ways to further the speed and reduce the logistical limits of our armies."
TRD_mass_combat:0 "Everyone Must Do Their Part"
TRD_mass_combat_desc:0 "While our economy is mighty, our army is not- we are a small nation surrounded by giants, with our backs to the sea. If we are to maintain our independence we need to focus on mobilising the masses in defense of their country, with propaganda promoting the common good of Skyfall."
TRD_citizen_soldiers:0 "The Citizen Soldier"
TRD_citizen_soldiers_desc:0 "We shall glorify the idea of the citizen soldier- of the common griffon who joins the fight for his country, fighting with fury for his homeland. And through this, the idea we propose shall become real in the hearts of the people, and therefore become a true reality."
TRD_expand_the_draft:0 "Autonomous Officers"
TRD_expand_the_draft_desc:0 "While the paradigm has long been that command structures should promote heirarchy, we have moved in the opposite direction. With our focus on the individual unit, whether armour or infantry, we have given more power to the individual officer than we have to the command structure which used to hold the army together. We must adapt and accept this change."
TRD_gun_factories:0 "Buyout Armouries"
TRD_gun_factories_desc:0 "There are many factories in our nation which could be of use to our burgeoning military, and yet are controlled by the private market- this can be fixed easily, with a few buyouts and a few encouragements to sell them."
TRD_doctrinal_development:0 "Doctrinal Development"
TRD_doctrinal_development_desc:0 "In the past our military doctrine has been unspectacular, a reflection of those around us rather than our own. However, with our recent developments we have began to create a doctrine which, while not unique to us, is in some ways our own, and with this we have began to explore the possibilities of our doctrine further, and should promote doing so."
TRD_spearhead:0 "The Spearhead"
TRD_spearhead_desc:0 "The concept of a spearhead, while not new, has been revolutionised by developments in armoured warfare and as such should be incorporated into our new doctrine, developing it further and making our offensive maneuvers more effective."
TRD_guerilla_training:0 "Esprit De Corps"
TRD_guerilla_training_desc:0 "Comraderie, honor, duty- whatever it may be, the common spirit of our army must be promoted, so we shall have a unified and motivated fighting force prepared to fight."
TRD_support_squads:0 "Support Squads"
TRD_support_squads_desc:0 "With our focus on smaller entities within the army, the importance of support squads to help our divisions has become more important and so more resources should be put into developing new equipment and tactics for these support squads."
TRD_archibalds_knight:0 "The Freie Knechten"
TRD_archibalds_knight_desc:0 "For all its wealth, Skyfall is a small country from which we can only conscript so many soldiers. Fortunately for us, there are soldiers willing to fight for money. Let us invite the famed Leopard Company to serve us."
TRD_archlights_mages:0 "Le Carnaval Magique"
TRD_archlights_mages_desc:0 "Pony nations have always had one advantage over Griffonian ones: magic. If we can hire some mercenary unicorns, we can harness their magic of destruction to gain an edge on the battlefied!"
TRD_clouds_pegasi:0 "Oi Myrioi"
TRD_clouds_pegasi_desc:0 "While Griffonian warfare has evolved somewhat away from exploiting our natural ability to fly, the Nimbusians have almost turned flying infantry into an art form. And a mercenary called Cloud Jet is offering us his expertise."
TRD_centralised_command:0 "Centralised Command Structure"
TRD_centralised_command_desc:0 "To further the effectiveness of our army we first must strengthen our command structure, further centralising it and allowing for a better organised army. Though this may reduce our tactical flexibility, it is worth the cost."
TRD_massed_artillery:0 "An Endless Barrage"
TRD_massed_artillery_desc:0 "Artillery has never failed us in the past, and as such we should focus more on it. Using our strong economy, we can create mass artillery which can overwhelm the enemy- our doctrine should be a reflection of this."
TRD_overwhelming_firepower:0 "Overwhelming Firepower"
TRD_overwhelming_firepower_desc:0 "Why throw good griffons to their death when we could launch shells instead? By taking advantage of our economy to overwhelm the enemy with bombardment and bullets, we will not provide them any time to recover from our attacks- allowing us to easily defeat them."
TRD_trench_warfare_f:0 "The Classics"
TRD_trench_warfare_f_desc:0 "There's no need to fix what isn't broken- and the classical tactics of superior planning and preperation are the safest way to go, as a cunning plan can win many battles which seem lost."
TRD_a_plan_for_everything:0 "A Plan For Everything"
TRD_a_plan_for_everything_desc:0 "The great minds of our military staff will be forever at work, hatching plans for any scenario, no matter how unlikely- and through their ingenuity we shall keep our nation prepared."
TRD_a_grand_army:0 "A Grand Army"
TRD_a_grand_army_desc:0 "Our army must be grand, and it must be organised- these two things are certain, and must be promoted above all else. For if the army falls into disarray, or there are no griffons to use the guns, nothing else will matter."
TRD_motorization_f:0 "Motorisation"
TRD_motorization_f_desc:0 "Warfare has always required flexibility, modern warfare more than ever. While infantry provide some of this, implementing motorised infantry either in support roles or in their own units will help to provide much-needed speed on the battlefield."
TRD_radio_implementation:0 "Radio Implementation"
TRD_radio_implementation_desc:0 "The radio is a marvelous invention, and perfect for our army. Through its use we can maintain our command over vast distances, and transfer information from one side of the country to the next. We need to take advantage of this at once, lest our enemies do so first."
TRD_complete_destruction:0 "Complete Annihilation"
TRD_complete_destruction_desc:0 "Our artillery will fill the skies, their steel rain supplied by the mighty industries of our nation. Never will the enemy be safe from our oppressive firepower, annihilating any resistance from our army's advance- or preventing any push into our homeland."
TRD_cryptography:0 "Dig In And Pray"
TRD_cryptography_desc:0 "Our infantry must always be prepared to dig entrenchments and follow orders, frontline engineers preparing fortifications as their officers plan for the next offensive."
TRD_artillery_construction:0 "The Lionwares Buyout"
TRD_artillery_construction_desc:0 "Lionwares Cannonry of Wonders, a company which produces, well, cannons- has quite a few factories. Factories with trained workers, specialised equipment, all of which would be perfect for our artillery guns- with a little persuasion and a good bit of money, we will be able to purchase this company for state use, and put it to use making our guns."
TRD_new_artillery:0 "Cannons of the Modern Age"
TRD_new_artillery_desc:0 "Our guns have become outdated, and this cannot do. We need to focus on updating our artillery in order to maintain a competetive fighting force, and not fall behind."
TRD_special_forces_initiative:0 "Taskforce 141"
TRD_special_forces_initiative_desc:0 "While our army is fine, it is lacking in divisions dedicated to specialised tasks. While we have some veteran marines, little else exists- this must change if we are to establish a further presence in the skies and sea."
TRD_rocket_artillery_f:0 "The Nebelwerfer"
TRD_rocket_artillery_f_desc:0 "The Nebelwerfer- a smoke mortar- is a hypothetical weapon idea that has been brought to us for further development. In concept used for throwing smoke shells, it also would be useful for everything from High Explosive rounds to different gas-based payloads."
TRD_mobile_artillery_batteries:0 "New Armouries"
TRD_mobile_artillery_batteries_desc:0 "Our old factories have served us well, but to take advantage of the new generation equipment we are developing we need to build new factories to produce them."
TRD_grifftonia_academy:0 "The West Beak Military Academy"
TRD_grifftonia_academy_desc:0 "As we develop our army, we need both to promote developments in our weaponry and tactics, as well as training new officers and soldiers. As such, the idea has been pitched for us to create a new military academy- one which could help train our officers and those creating new technologies for us to use."
TRD_magical_rifles:0 "The Power of Crystals"
TRD_magical_rifles_desc:0 "While magic technology has been mostly untapped in our army, there is a steady supply of crystals in the northern hills we could easily purchase for use. Magical weaponry might give us an edge over our enemies, and so the idea of developing our own magical rifles has been brought forth."
#Begining Bolotic#
TRD_the_final_days:0 "The Meeting"
TRD_the_final_days_desc:0 "It is once again time for a meeting of the trade council, where representatives of the various businesses meet along with the Chancellor to discuss matters of finance in the city.

TRD_enhancing_our_prosperity:0 "Our Prosperous Little Nation"
TRD_enhancing_our_prosperity_desc:0 "The Chancellor has made his decision. With his ability to hold on to complete power fading, he has put his trust in the merchants which are the lifeblood of our society, in hopes of bringing further wealth and prosperity to our nation. His grip on the nation's politics remains strong however, and while he is around no transfer of power will be made, only concessions."
TRD_sell_unpforitable_businesses:0 "Liquidate Unprofitable Assets"
TRD_sell_unpforitable_businesses_desc:0 "Supporters of austerity have petitioned the government, claiming that unprofitable and useless assets are leading to economic issues for the state.

TRD_the_golden_standard:0 "The Golden Brand"
TRD_the_golden_standard_desc:0 "Reputation means very much in business, and our industry knows this.

TRD_industrial_grants:0 "Address Businesses' Funding Schemes"
TRD_industrial_grants_desc:0 "Skyfall business is booming. However, much of our prosperity has been founded on debt financing, something which may not be sustainable on the long term. Fortunately for Skyfall, Guichard has a plan. Guichard always has a plan."
TRD_unsavory_friends:0 "The Changeling Supply"
TRD_unsavory_friends_desc:0 "Hippolyte Bechard, a rather unscrupulous griffon but nonetheless a powerful one, has approached us with an offer.

TRD_golden_griffon_cigars:0 "The Golden Griffon Cigarettes"
TRD_golden_griffon_cigars_desc:0 "Along with the many luxury goods we produce, cigarettes are one of our most popular exports. However, at the request of our 'friends', we have lifted some restrictions, leading to a further boom- primarily lead by Whitefeather, who has established a very popular cigarette line which customers cannot seem to stop buying."
TRD_the_pile_of_money:0 "Let the Money Flow"
TRD_the_pile_of_money_desc:0 "With our reforms completed and our capitalist allies sated, the Chancellor can finally rest and enjoy the fruit of his labor. With the economy booming and trade following suit, our nation is sure to grow to new heights in the world."

TRD_the_chancellors_authority:0 "Our Beloved Chancellor"
TRD_the_chancellors_authority_desc:0 "The fools of politics go on and discuss their plans, take from the poor give to the rich, take from the rich give to the poor. Guichard is sick of it all, let the fools blabber and talk. For the Iron Chancellor doesn't talk, he acts."
TRD_hunt_syndie_cells:0 "Hunt the Syndicalists"

TRD_hunt_borealistes_desc:0 "The Boreasiste have now for a long time been advocating for a theocracy within Skyfall, lead by Gertjan Desramaux who is nothing more than a puppet of Eros that pleads for power and control. A weak griffon who wants nothing more than power for a vapid goal of making his god proud. But Boreas prefers the wise to the fools."
TRD_absolute_power:0 "Total Control"
TRD_absolute_power_desc:0 "Finally, after all this time and work. Guichard's goals have been met, he has cleansed Skyfall of the ones who wish to ruin it, never shall the syndicalists nor boreasiste even think of doing anything to hurt this nation ever again. Truly, Guichard has saved Skyfall."

TRD_combating_inequality_desc:0 "Under the advice of his niece Genevieve Guildedwing, our chancellor has decided to address the social question in our country.

TRD_try_to_improve_conditions:0 "Increase the Wages"
TRD_try_to_improve_conditions_desc:0 "According to reports, the average wage of the Skyfallian worker is barely enough to allow them to survive, let alone live decently.

TRD_meet_with_syndicate_leaders_desc:0 "For years now, the Trade Federation has refused to entertain the demands of the vakbonden and the labour movements at large.

TRD_indirect_soup_kitchnes:0 "Feed the Poor"

TRD_the_death_of_guichard_desc:0 "With Guichard's death, the political landscape of Skyfall has been opened up for the first time since the Revolution. With the people sedated through the late Chancellor's donation, unrest that might come from such a change in power has been mostly avoided. With the office of chancellor now vacant, time will only tell who will take the Iron Chancellor's place."
TRD_the_industrialist:0 "The Captain of Industry"

TRD_synchronization:0 "Synchronization"
TRD_synchronization_desc:0 "Through carefully synchronizing every aspect of a production line, every aspect of production is improved; speed can be increased, there is not a need for as many workers, and less resources and time is wasted. By spreading this practice we can help improve our nation's industrial capacity."
TRD_precision:0 "Precision"
TRD_precision_desc:0 "Precision is extremely important in industry- no flaws are to be accepted in a self-respecting business. It is through this maxim that we will maintain our reputation as the producer of some of the finest goods in the world, and through which our industry will stay dominant."
TRD_specialization:0 "Specialization"
TRD_specialization_desc:0 "The modern production line, as utilised in our factories, cannot function unless specialised.

TRD_a_living_wage:0 "A Living Wage"
TRD_a_living_wage_desc:0 "As our industry grows and more and more workers flood into our factories, the appeal of unions grows with them. While a more brash griffon might simply put these down with threats, our chancellor knows better. Through raising the wages of the workers to a more liveable sum, he will discourage the formation of unions and encourage company loyalty."
TRD_the_banker:0 "The Banker"
TRD_the_banker_desc:0 "Ferdinand von Hochsklaue is one of the most powerful griffons in the city of Skyfall, with heavy influences throughout the banking industry.

TRD_rebuild_trust_desc:0 "With the death of the Iron Chancellor and von Hochsklaue's ascension to power, Skyfall is once again ready to face the world. Our government has stabilised and we have a bountiful treasury, both of which will help us maintain our secure position in the world."

TRD_the_banking_capital_of_griffonia_desc:0 "The idol is the most important figure in Skyfall- above the chancellor, and above the state itself, all power flows from the idol. This, von Hochsklaue believes, must be acknowledged- and only be acknowledging it can one truly understand our society. With his control of the idol, he truly controls the nation."
TRD_the_merc:0 "The Mercenary Lord"
TRD_the_merc_desc:0 "Hippolyte Bechard, a backhanded arms dealer with an impressive number of 'friends', is both powerful and dangerous.

TRD_old_friends:0 "Bechard Armurerie"
TRD_old_friends_desc:0 "To create a grand army, one requires guns- and what manufacturies Bechard already has simply will not do. To help fuel Skyfall's growing army, more resources must be diverted to arms manufacturing and creating more military industry."
TRD_generous_donations:0 "Generous 'Donations'"
TRD_generous_donations_desc:0 "Bechard's profits do not usually come from 'legitimate' business, and this presents a problem for a supposedly righteous head of state- how is one to maintain a good reputation while their money comes from disreputable places? By routing illicitly gained funds through 'generous supporters' we can disguise them as donations- fooling the untrained eye."
TRD_sailor_lord:0 "The Skyfall Foreign Legion"
TRD_sailor_lord_desc:0 "While many griffons throughout Skyfall would like to join the army, the numbers are not high enough. While Skyfall already has a large immigrant population, by actively employing foreigners with generous pay into the Légion Étrangère, divisions comprised of both domestic and foreign recruits, we can bolster the size of our army."
TRD_robber_baron:0 "An Army For Hire"
TRD_robber_baron_desc:0 "With our army finally at a respectable size, and our payments to them leaving us as a loss, we must begin to put them to use.

TRD_the_kingpin:0 "The Kingpin"
TRD_the_kingpin_desc:0 "Walter Whitefeather sits as the king of Skyfall's underground- he has subjugated the competition in his business and the late chancellor's generous reforms have allowed him to flourish even more. However, with the seat of power opening up, so does an opportunity- an opportunity for Skyfall to truly embrace the most profitable of business."
TRD_booze:0 "Branch Out"
TRD_booze_desc:0 "While drugs are highly profitable, they are not the best of vices for a growing society, nor the best business for expanding. Though the heart of his empire will always be narcotics, the chancellor has begun to expand into alcohol and smuggling, providing him a more stable base to fall back on and allowing him room to expand in other sectors."
TRD_control_the_underworld:0 "Control the Underworld"
TRD_control_the_underworld_desc:0 "With Whitefeather ascendant to power, he now has the ability to secure his base- the underworld. Though he already has a high level of control, there is still some competition, though they will not last long with his chancellorship. Once he has completely taken over the underworld, he will be prepared to make moves to secure his power over Skyfall in its entirety..."

TRD_the_one_who_knocks_desc:0 "With Whitefeather's growing power, a reign of terror has begun. Those who dare to oppose them find themselves in the same scenario, in which there are two griffons- the one who knocks, and the griffon who is shot. Whitefeather and his adherents have made sure to be the ones knocking."

TRD_the_finest_technicians_desc:0 "Though the practice of hiring foreigners to improve our products has already become commonplace, it has not been until our recent look outwards that we have managed to attract truely great minds. From across the world, we can attract finely skilled creatures to work on our products, to improve our reputation even more, and help us develop new innovations."
TRD_oil_experiments:0 "Black Gold"
TRD_oil_experiments_desc:0 "With Feathisia's bountiful oil fields lying just to our east, we have often looked on in envy. However, with our increased attention from foreign experts, an opportunity surfaces- the opportunity to invest into the brave frontier of synthetic fuel. Not only can we use this technology to supply our own country, we can sell our product to other countries, joining our neighbor in the great profits of the oil industry."
TRD_scientific_advancement:0 "Technocratic Principles"
TRD_scientific_advancement_desc:0 "Technology has brought Skyfall to great heights, allowing our businesses to flourish through innovation, and bringing us some of the first factories in Griffonia under our prosperous capitalist system. We should embrace this and encourage technocratic principles and thinking in business and in our government, by promoting invention throughout the country."
TRD_war_is_a_racket:0 "War is a Racket"
TRD_war_is_a_racket_desc:0 "War may be hellish, but if it's going to rage anyways, why not profit off of it? With our armouries full of weapons and those of foreign nations empty, we should take advantage of this and sell our weapons to them at high but not unreasonable prices, sure to make us a nice profit."
TRD_industry_is_booming:0 "The Home of the Industrial Revolution"
TRD_industry_is_booming_desc:0 "Much of Griffonia is still backwards, full of illiterates and without proper industry. However, Skyfall stands as a stark contrast to that- a mighty industrialised nation, no doubt due our unique capitalistic way of life. This early industrialisation has given us a leg up on the rest of Griffonia, and allowed our industry to flourish."
TRD_spending_spree:0 "A Haven for the Rich"
TRD_spending_spree_desc:0 "With most business-minded griffons either being trapped in wartorn countries or under the boots of aristocracy or socialists, Skyfall stands as a haven for these griffons. With our lax taxation and regulations, high promotion of business and position as the 'port of Griffonia', we will attract these griffons from across the continent, bringing their money and ideas with them."
TRD_the_busiest_ports:0 "The Busiest Ports"
TRD_the_busiest_ports_desc:0 "Our grand city is the crossroads between continents- much of the trade between continents and even on the continent flows through our docks and streets, and business across the world relies on us. Along with a myriad of other benefits, this has allowed our shipping industry to flourish and with it provided benefits to our navy."
TRD_state_farms:0 "Federal Farms"
TRD_state_farms_desc:0 "Though we have previously relied on imports to feed Skyfall, with our growing population we should look to reducing our reliance on foreign produce. The fertile and (relatively) unexploited lands in the rural areas around our cities are perfect for this. While they are currently occupied by inefficient family farms, we could aggressively buy up their land to create more efficient federal farmland, perfect to feed our growing city."
TRD_no_more_taxes:0 "Taxation is Theft"
TRD_no_more_taxes_desc:0 "Taxes have long been a great issue for honest businessgriffs such as our chancellor, the state stealing the work of its subjects, and for what? With some... encouragement from other business in Skyfall, we should work on reducing the state's reliance on this outdated system."
TRD_no_such_thing_as_jobless:0 "Work For Your Bread"
TRD_no_such_thing_as_jobless_desc:0 "There is no such thing as a free lunch- or atleast, there should not be. Though the spineless harmonists and radical communists may see charity as simply helping those in need, we see it as what it is- promoting laziness and unemployment. By forcing these do-nothings to work for their food, we can help create a workforce to build up our great city, and stop letting these leeches drag our society down."
TRD_company_housing:0 "Company Housing"
TRD_company_housing_desc:0 "Though landlords still dominate much of the housing industry in our country, there are more efficient ways to organise things. By promoting the use of company-provided housing, workers will be more efficiently organised and our business will benefit from more control over their employees."
TRD_import_workers:0 "A New Workforce"
TRD_import_workers_desc:0 "With our workforce growing both as eager to work immigrants arrive and more griffons take up even more work, our nation prospers. With companies being forced to pay less and having high levels of control over their workers, Skyfall is growing quickly and so are its businesses. We have defined a new way to organise labor, perfect to help our nation thrive."
TRD_capital_of_the_world:0 "Come On Down to Skyfall!"
TRD_capital_of_the_world_desc:0 "With our chancellor's most important reforms complete, Skyfall has emerged from the power vacuum with a new, prosperous path.

TRD_naval_planes_f:0 "The Naval Aviation Department"
TRD_naval_planes_f_desc:0 "In accordance with Whitefeather's plan, we need to focus not only on developing superior ships, but also on the planes to fit them. We need to create bombers which can more easily be used on carriers and in naval combat, to take full advantage of our new naval direction."
TRD_heavy_cruiser_f:0 "Heavier Cruisers"
TRD_heavy_cruiser_f_desc:0 "Cruisers, while not as strong as battleships, are still useful and should not be overlooked. By developing a new line of especially heavy cruisers, we can support our main fleet with less expensive but still effective heavy ships."

TRD_carrier_experiments_desc:0 "Time has come to complete the chancellor's plan, focused on modernising Skyfall's carrier fleet to make it competitive in modern naval combat.

TRD_heavier_guns_desc:0 "Our new ships need new guns to go with them, and so we need to modernise our weaponry as well. With the development of a strong 40cm battery to fit our ships, we will make sure that our ships have guns strong enough to compete."
TRD_extra_heavy_armour:0 "Enchanted Plating"
TRD_extra_heavy_armour_desc:0 "A rather novel idea combining griffon magic of enchanted machinery and new magical technology, it has been suggested by some that we could enchant the plating of our ships to make them more resistant to fire. While an unconventional idea, it may very well be useful."

TRD_smugglers:0 "Out of Sight, Out of Mind"
TRD_smugglers_desc:0 "While many oppose the idea of being host to our 'friends', surely noone could oppose the move if they were not aware of it. By keeping our friends secret from most, we can reap the benefits of their cooperation while still maintaining the opinion of those who might object."

TRD_the_new_admirality_desc:0 "With our expanding navy, we must also develop the officer corps which will lead our ships.

TRD_heavy_fighter_f:0 "Heavier Fighters"
TRD_heavy_fighter_f_desc:0 "While our current fighters function fine, it may be possible for us to improve them. The highly developed and small area of our nation means that perhaps heavier, more powerful aircraft could be useful, allowing us to more easily control the air while issues of logistics are solved by our strong infrastructure."
TRD_paratroopers_f:0 "The Krijgers"

TRD_utter_destruction:0 "Utter Destruction"
TRD_utter_destruction_desc:0 "The ultimate purpose of the airforce is to support the army, and our doctrine must reflect that.

TRD_bow_to_the_empire_desc:0 "With the Chancellor and syndicalist yoke both thrown off, the faithful boreasiste have taken the city. Skyfall is in a sad state- the temples have been weakened in the tyrant Chancellor's bid for power, and the people of Skyfall are downtrodden and without morals. It is up to our new government to restore Skyfall to virtuous glory- but first, we must decide whether to go it alone, or return to the empire."

TRD_abstinance_policies_desc:0 "Along with prostitution, alcohol and other degenerate forms of recreation have become widespread in Skyfall.

TRD_church_primacy:0 "Temple Primacy"
TRD_church_primacy_desc:0 "While we have returned to the empire, we are not a typical Imperial vassal. Unlike other areas in the empire, we have no nobility- no entrenched aristocracy.

TRD_crackdown_on_resistance:0 "Crack Down On the Resistance"
TRD_crackdown_on_resistance_desc:0 "While we have emerged victorious in the revolution, many are still in open rebellion against our new state, with many more holding rebellious ideals in their hearts.

TRD_skyfall_legion_desc:0 "We should further our military ties to the empire, and invite military advisors from Griffenheim to help modernise our forces.

TRD_loyalist_regiments:0 "Save the Loyalist Regiments"
TRD_loyalist_regiments_desc:0 "With the passing of power from the late emperor to the current regent, many divisions have lost faith in the empire- being governed by a foreign noble, with the heir to the throne too young to act.

TRD_all_the_exiles_desc:0 "It is clear to any good griffon that the nobility have no good intentions for the empire- while they may decry those who fight against them as treasonous, they are the true traitors, and us the true loyalists- loyal to the people and to our values. We must make ourselves open for any friendly opposition to the Duchess's regency, making ourselves a home for the resistance to her rule."
TRD_prepare_the_liberation:0 "Prepare For the Endkrieg"
TRD_prepare_the_liberation_desc:0 "We must act quickly- as the nobility entrench themselves on the throne of Griffenheim, they grow fat off of the people, but also begin to arm the people to defend them.

TRD_the_archons_speech_desc:0 "The recent ascension of the Archon to power has left many griffons in our nation... restless. While this was to be expected with dissidents, some of the boreaiste themselves have raised concern- particularly about his bellicose attitude in regards to the Empire. To answer these concerns, the Archon himself has prepared a speech- a speech which he will address to the people of Skyfall..."

TRD_destroy_the_syndicates_desc:0 "The syndicates are an affront both to our nation and to Boreas.

TRD_secure_skyfall:0 "Secure Skyfall"
TRD_secure_skyfall_desc:0 "We must quickly move to continue our efforts to purge the dissident from Skyfall. While in our control firmly, there are still those disloyal, or homeless, or criminal. We should first begin by providing jobs for the many displaced griffons, lives ruined by the revolution- their idle claws will rebuild our nation. Next, a strict curfew- using our police to rid the streets of degenerates who refuse to work."
TRD_integrate_boreaiste:0 "Integrate the Boreaiste"
TRD_integrate_boreaiste_desc:0 "The boreaiste have always been a noble group, both as a paramilitary and a political force- but, with the rise of the Archon to power, we must begin to make efforts to integrate the boreaiste. While the paramilitary arm has already somewhat adjusted, many political figures are still loyal to the boreaiste- rather than the Archon. This must be rectified, to create a truly unified government."
TRD_kill_em_all:0 "Let Boreas Sort Them Out"
TRD_kill_em_all_desc:0 "While we have broken up the last of the formal syndicalist organisations, we have yet to properly deal with their members. While some have proposed trial by law, or arrest, or banishment- these are all ineffective both at stopping future syndicalism and at properly punishing those of the current day. There is but one solution, one which the Archon seconds- we will kill them all, and let Boreas sort them out."
TRD_herzland_language_programs:0 "The Herzland Dialect"
TRD_herzland_language_programs_desc:0 "The Archon believes that if the Empire is to survive in the future, there must be efforts to culturally unite the desperate regions- and that starts with Skyfall. While our people currently speak a different dialect than that of the Herzland, the Archon desires that we begin to teach in the Herzland dialect, hoping to transition our nation over to a more unified language in the future."
TRD_morals_police:0 "Moralische Polizei"
TRD_morals_police_desc:0 "Skyfall is still plagued by degeneracy, spread by the previous debauched capitalist government. To fix this, our new state shall establish a moral police made up of faithful griffons. These groups will enforce morality primarily through coercion, helping to stop the widespread practices of prostitution, drug use and moral degeneracy, as well as acting as a method of enforcing temple doctrine."
TRD_state_eleos:0 "State Eleos"
TRD_state_eleos_desc:0 "At our core, behind every policy we put into place, are our morals- and one key moral is that of compassion. We should establish a formal state welfare in tandem with the temples, so that the people will know not only Boreas's wisdom and fury, but also his love."
TRD_mandatory_church_attendence:0 "Mandatory Temple Attendance"
TRD_mandatory_church_attendence_desc:0 "One of the aspects most evident of the state of Skyfall before the revolution, was the prevelance of atheism- true within both the rich and poor. Now that we have rescued Skyfall, we must make sure that no griffon can be so decieved as to forget Boreas's grace- and as such, that moral debauchery will be eliminated, and replaced with love for Boreas."
TRD_reclaim_the_birthright:0 "Reclaim the Empire"
TRD_reclaim_the_birthright_desc:0 "With tensions rising ever since Gabriela rose to regency, and our Archon Eros fled abroad, it has always been clear what the inevitable outcome would be- the complete destruction of one of the factions, through war or other means.

TRD_synthethic_oil_experiments_desc:0 "While to the east of us lie the bountiful oil fields of Feathisia, and to the western oceans oil lies in the sea, we sadly lack a natural source.

TRD_state_unions:0 "Establish the Staatsvakbonden"
TRD_state_unions_desc:0 "Unions played a large part in Skyfall life before the revolution- but most unions before were morally bankrupt and syndicalist.

TRD_build_new_jobs:0 "Jobs For the People"
TRD_build_new_jobs_desc:0 "With our economy still in shambles, we must make sure our priorities are proper. Before anything, we must make sure our people have jobs.

TRD_arms_factory_rebuilding_desc:0 "The revolution has left Skyfall defenseless, with little but the few militias created during the short fighting and former military griffons who pledged their loyalty to our cause.

TRD_new_railroads:0 "Nationale Spoorwegen"
TRD_new_railroads_desc:0 "Skyfall's infrastructure is largely underdeveloped outside of major population centers, and what little there was damaged by the revolution.

TRD_work_brigades:0 "Form the Arbeidersbataljons"

TRD_initial_recovery_f:0 "Fiscal Stability"
TRD_initial_recovery_f_desc:0 "While many would call our former capitalist government "prosperous", little of that wealth was seen by the lower classes.

TRD_modernisation:0 "Industrial Advancement"

TRD_researsch_slot_fascist_desc:0 "Though the temples have always had a great investment in education, in the time before the revolution the government made efforts to reduce temple influence in education.

TRD_computing:0 "The Z1 Computer"

TRD_steel_mill_grants:0 "Expand the Steel Mills"
TRD_steel_mill_grants_desc:0 "One of Skyfall's most important natural resources is our steel. However, much of our steel is mined in impoverished rural communities.

TRD_producing_steel:0 "Adopt the Featherdin Process"
TRD_producing_steel_desc:0 "By adopting more modern mining practices, such as the Featherdin process, we can increase output and reduce the amount of labor necessary for an equal yield, bringing prosperity to the mining towns dotting the outer reaches of our nation."
TRD_full_economic_recovery:0 "A Miraculous Recovery"
TRD_full_economic_recovery_desc:0 "With our investments in the economy and focus on a stable and self-sufficient economy, we have managed a swift recovery from the horrors of the revolution. There is still work to be done, but the worst of our recession is over- Boreas's sun rises over Skyfall."

TRD_reform_the_army_desc:0 "While our forces emerged victorious in the revolution, our army is... subpar at best, and a bunch of rabble and militia at worst.

TRD_mass_assault_f:0 "Griffon Wave Tactics"
TRD_mass_assault_f_desc:0 "While it is not a popular strategy, mass assault tactics are a viable way to quickly transition our militias from disorganised groups to proper units, though our long-term organisition will suffer. This tactic is favored by many of the lower tier militia leaders which emerged in the revolution, and disfavored by many of the old guard."
TRD_superior_firepower_f:0 "Fire and Brimstone"
TRD_superior_firepower_f_desc:0 "The doctrine of artillery strikes and massed firepower is largely favored by the old guard, who believe the robust industry of Skyfall can support such a doctrine. While some may see these griffons as stuck in their ways, and unable to adapt for modern times, artillery is a tried and true force on the battlefield, and there are several ways we could continue to develop the doctrine for modern times."
TRD_mobile_warfare_f:0 "Blitzkrieg!"
TRD_mobile_warfare_f_desc:0 "Favored by some of the newer, more bold officers, the idea of blitzkrieg favors the use of armoured spearheads to break defensive lines, and to capitalise on said breakthroughs using mobile infantry with air support. While it is an interesting proposal, our lack of a domestic oil supply has caused some to question if such a doctrine would be sustainable."
TRD_fash_rifles:0 "The Karabiner 09K"
TRD_fash_rifles_desc:0 "While developed by private industry before the revolution, the Karabiner 09k is a bolt-action rifle using a self-feeding stripper clip. We should both adopt this weapon as the standard equipment for our military, and also patronise the company that made it, promoting their engineering divisions to further supply our military with equipment."
TRD_artillery_fash:0 "Modern Artillery"
TRD_artillery_fash_desc:0 "Along with the modernisation of our doctrine and infantry equipment, we must develop more advanced artillery to meet the current times as well. While the specific developments needed must be chosen depending on what use we need artillery for, we must further develop artillery under any doctrine."
TRD_support_fash:0 "Dedicated Support Squads"
TRD_support_fash_desc:0 "Our divisions should consist not only of infantry or vehicles, but also of specialised support battalions. Though not a new idea, if we formally create specialised support squads to assist divisions, and further training and research into improving said squads, we can boost the efficiency of our army as a whole."
TRD_rocket_artillery_fash:0 "The Nebelwerfer"
TRD_rocket_artillery_fash_desc:0 "A controversial project has made leeway in the higher military staff- a research project involving an advanced gun capable of launching shells containing poisonous gas, dubbed the "Nebelwerfer", or smoke mortar, to disguise its purpose, gas-based payloads still being considered barbaric by some."
TRD_anti_tank_fash:0 "Anti-Tank Cannons"
TRD_anti_tank_fash_desc:0 "Even with the best artillery or rifles in the world, a tank would outclass our current technology. We must develop anti-tank technology, to utilise both in support roles for standard units and in specialised units, to combat the rising threat of mechanised and armored warfare."
TRD_boreaiste_officers:0 "A New Officer Corps"
TRD_boreaiste_officers_desc:0 "With the revolution came the total upheaval of Skyfall's society, and with it the military structures that stood in place since the greater revolution in which Skyfall broke free. We must continuously promote the best minds of our troops, in militias and in new units, and begin to create a new officer corps to lead our military, and to develop new technologies for the modern day."
TRD_fanatiscism:0 "Fanatic Loyalty"
TRD_fanatiscism_desc:0 "In our officers, in our soldiers, and in our people, we must prioritise one thing- loyalty to Boreas, and to the boreasiste. A government cannot stand with a people who do not believe in it- an army cannot function without soldiers who stay loyal- and defeatist officers will do nothing but create self-fulfilling prophecies. As long as Boreas's will is with us- we shall stand."
TRD_extend_conscription:0 "Rally the People"
TRD_extend_conscription_desc:0 "If we are to mobilise a proper military, we must first mobilise the griffonpower necessary. By using large-scale propaganda and forced conscription, we can bolster the ranks of our army as necessary to defend our cause and people, creating a new caste of loyal career soldiers funded by the state to enact our will."
TRD_arm_the_people:0 "Arm The Nation"
TRD_arm_the_people_desc:0 "With our ranks growing and army modernising, we must begin to mobilise our industry as well. Technology is nothing without factories to utilise it- griffons nothing without a rifle to hold. By enacting further laws enabling state appropriation of industry and converting abandoned factories into weapon factories, we can hope to rebuild our military industry."
TRD_motorisation:0 "Unit Motorisation"
TRD_motorisation_desc:0 "In modern times, manuever is becoming a very important aspect of warfare, especially on areas such as the plains throughout our nation and in several of our neighbors. If we are to function in this modern setting, we must begin the shift towards a motorised army, or at the very least begin research into the possibility."
TRD_light_tank_fash:0 "Light Panzer Development"
TRD_light_tank_fash_desc:0 "Along with motorised infantry, an aspect of growing importance in warfare is armor- once a novelty, tanks are emerging as one of the prime forces on the battlefield of the modern day. Light tanks, taking the role of anti-infantry and scouting, are the first step towards embracing this new form of warfare."
TRD_medium_tank_fash:0 "Adopt Changeling Panzers"
TRD_medium_tank_fash_desc:0 "Nowhere is the new art of armored warfare most perfected as the changeling lands- With their strong industry and ambitious military staff, they have all but created the modern school of panzer warfare.

TRD_cat_base_strike_f_fash_desc:0 "Moving forward with our naval strategy, we must move on from our old doctrine of the grand battle fleet.

TRD_heavy_cruiser_f_fash_desc:0 "Very heavy ships can often be too resource intensive to be viable, and yet often some level of heavy firepower is necessary. To combat this we must develop a median between cruiser and heavy ship- the battlecruiser. These vessels will serve both to defend vulnerable ships and as combat vessels all their own, a suitable stand-in for the battleship."
TRD_destroyer_f_fash:0 "Patrol Boats"
TRD_destroyer_f_fash_desc:0 "While cruisers and battleships are well and good, smaller ships are a necessity both to combat submarines and serve as scouting vessels for the larger navy.

TRD_the_long_lance_fash_desc:0 "Dubbed the "Long Lance" by some, our naval research has developed an innovative new design for torpedoes- longer, as the name implies, and using compressed oxygen in its propulsion, the long lance is a testament to our innovative naval research and should begin to be applied in the field."
TRD_carrier_experiments_fash:0 "Carrier Experiments"

TRD_new_admirality_fash_desc:0 "The days of the post-revolution power vacuum are gone- new officers and new doctrine has risen to the challenge and now guide our navy, and our admiralty has began a resurgence, many of whom were former revolutionaries who rose to the cause.

TRD_fighter_projects_fash:0 "New Fighter Craft"
TRD_fighter_projects_fash_desc:0 "Before any other action can be taken in the air, one must attain control- bombers cannot bomb while they are shot to the ground, after all. As such our first priority should be maintaining up to date and strong fighter wings with which to contest the air."
TRD_doctrinal_development_air_fash:0 "Air Training"
TRD_doctrinal_development_air_fash_desc:0 "Along with designing new crafts, we must develop a new doctrine to guide our air force. With the help of our slowly growing officer corps, we need to decide a strong direction for where to direct our air force's resources."

TRD_actual_air_bases_fash_desc:0 "Despite our government and society centering around the city of Skyfall, our efforts in aviation have primarily taken place in the rural hills and plains to the east of Grifftonia, where our current primary air strip lies. While this is suitable for experimentation and training, in proper war we must be able to quickly defend Skyfall- we will put the griffons of the city to work paving a new grand air strip."
TRD_strat_fash:0 "Strategic Destruction"
TRD_strat_fash_desc:0 "A modern war cannot be fought without an economy to provide weapons- while fighters may be able to protect our own skies, they can do little in actual warfare. With precise, calculated strikes against the enemy's industries, we can decisively cripple the supplies of those we fight- but first, we must create bombers up to the task."
TRD_tact_fash:0 "Tactical Bombings"
TRD_tact_fash_desc:0 "While more specialised bombers are better to strike at the enemy's industry, stopping supply can do little if our armies are crushed- we should develop tactical bombers, allowing us to both support our troops and strike the enemy's factories and infrastructure."
TRD_napalm_fash:0 "Napalm"
TRD_napalm_fash_desc:0 "The deployment of napalm by our bombers has shown a noticeable increase in effectiveness, most notable due to its ability to stick both to structures and creatures, burning furiously at any material it connects with- we should begin to prepare our bombers for its use in actual warfare."
TRD_CAS_projects_fash:0 "Close Air Support Wings"
TRD_CAS_projects_fash_desc:0 "While fighters do well enough to protect our troops from enemy bombers, when it comes to infantry they are near useless. Close air support designs are perfect to support our army in its operations, and directly influence combat on the ground."
TRD_heavy_fighter_projects_fash:0 "Heavier Fighter Craft"
TRD_heavy_fighter_projects_fash_desc:0 "While our current fighters are adequate, they suffer from limited range and light armor. While we need to sacrifice the rather important aspect of agility to rectify this, heavier fighter designs can solve both issues."

TRD_contract_2_desc:0 "Eule Fluggesellschaft- Owl Airlines- Are a company which creates robust designs, particularly capable for long-range flights.

TRD_contract_3:0 "Greif Flugzeuge"
TRD_contract_3_desc:0 "Greif Flugzeuge- Griffon Aircrafts- Are a company whose best offer to us are their bomber designs.

TRD_rocket_project_fash:0 "The V-2 Rocket"
TRD_rocket_project_fash_desc:0 "Aside from advancements in traditional aviation, a few particularly eccentric- or perhaps forwardminded- griffons have been avid supporters of rocketry technology.

TRD_take_strawberry_bronzehill_desc:0 "Griffenheim was not won alone, and the greatest support for the Duchess was indeed found in her homelands- the duchy of Strawberry, where she was formerly duchess. To prevent this, we must finally reduce the autonomy both of Strawberry and the long-overprivileged dogs, to assure total loyalty to the empire."
TRD_take_yale_romau:0 "The Conquest of Yale"
TRD_take_yale_romau_desc:0 "The free city of Romau and Yale both have clearly been granted far too much autonomy over the past years, with radical thought everywhere in Yale's universities, and Romau having great priviliges as a free city. These two regions should be reminded they have no right to claim the mantle of "nationhood", as they might believe."

Anarchists and bandits run free, and in Katerin the princess's madness lets even worse run free.

TRD_strike_north:0 "Reclaim the North"
TRD_strike_north_desc:0 "The north must be reclaimed, despite its rather poor value. "President-Marshal" Kemerskai and his socialist stooges must be wiped off the map before they become a serious threat.

TRD_take_down_vedina:0 "Emperor Grover I's Only Mistake"
TRD_take_down_vedina_desc:0 "While Vedina was nominally an Imperial subject, in truth they were completely independent and cared little for the Empire. This is because of Emperor Grover I grave error, the only one he ever made: He made a deal with the local King.

TRD_execute_kemerskai:0 "Hang the Traitor"
TRD_execute_kemerskai_desc:0 "After so many long years, Kemerskai has finally been caught and will be brought to justice.

TRD_rebuild_griffinstone_imperial_desc:0 "After the tragic death of King Guto VI, Griffonstone was left without a leader and much like the Empire a bickering regency council was unable to run the country properly. As a result the former pride of griffonkind became dilapidated and poverty-stricken. To honour the memory of the King and to please the young Emperor, we must restore the city to its former glory, no matter how much it costs."

TRD_core_west:0 "Reintegrate the West"
TRD_core_west_desc:0 "Aquileia and its neighbouring regions have all been brought back into the fold. But this time we will not repeat the mistake of past Emperors.

TRD_core_south:0 "Reintegrate the South"
TRD_core_south_desc:0 "The "Free South" will be a thing of the past. No more shall Wingbardy and their former allies be subject states. Instead, they will be reorganized into an Imperial province.

TRD_strike_frontier:0 "Reclaim the Frontier"
TRD_strike_frontier_desc:0 "In 747, Emperor Grover I famously crossed the Creeper Mountains, catching the eastern principalities by surprise and subjugating them with ease.

tradefed.1.d:0 "The Leopard Company is one of the oldest mercenary companies still operating today. Their story is almost as old as the Griffonian Empire itself as they were formed during the reign of Grover II. They fought on both side during the conquest of southern Griffonia until the Emperor's wrath caused them to flee to Zebrica where they adopted their famous pattern and emblem: the leopard. Over time, their reputation of discretion, reliability and brutal efficiency made them shine in the mercenary world.\n\nDuring the upheaval caused by the imperial crisis, they once again fought on many sides and even served under Guichard when he trapped and slaughtered the Republican sailors. After that, they left for Zebrica once again to let Griffonian heads cool.\n\nIt took some effort and money but we have tracked down the famed Leopard Company and its captain, Leopold Weissner. While they remain mute over their previous contracts, rumors say they fought against the Storm King. Or for him. Who knows? Whatever they were doing there, their contract has ended and they are now free for employment. Our envoy has negotiated with Weissner and he has agreed to come and serve for us."

tradefed.2.d:0 "The Carnaval Magique is a young company of unicorns of Aquileian heritage born from the upheaval of the Aquileian Revolution and ensuing political turmoil. They were formed by a unicorn calling himself "Tartuffe" who, according to the stories, was a disgraced politician who had tried to serve both the Republican Revolutionaries and the Monarchy with expected results. The company soon became a haven for various exiles, unruly soldiers and disgraced members of the nobility. They served in many conflicts and stayed together even after their founder died from liver failure in 996.\n\nOur recruiter found them near Flowena after months of service in the former lands of Verenia that went unpaid due to undisclosed issues. Due to the amount of debts he was under, their captain Arclight de Liny agreed to the contract we offered well under what they are rumored to be worth.\n\nTheir arrival in Skyfall has however went less than stellarly. After being barracked in Grifftonia, several all of them were given permission and went on an alcoholic bender, causing quite a stir in the local bars."

Lead by one Cloud Jet, our recruiters found them in Riaportu's port.\n\nReportedly, the Myrioi company had crossed the Gryphusian authorities and so were more than interested in sailing far away from southern Griffonia. Cloud Jet has quickly agreed but bargained well despite this.\n\nWhen the company arrived, they were stationed in Grifftonia in a most un-nimbusian fashion. Relations between the mercenaries and the locals have been poor and the local commander was already forced to forbid several mercenaries of going out of the barracks."

tradefed.4.d:0 "The bar has been closed for many days now. Windows are shattered and the whole inn is basically a ruin. Around the 'ruin\n\nWhen we hired the Myrioi and the Carnaval we had expected them to more or less keep themselves to their own quarters and hopefully not venture too far into the city. In hindsight, and knowing that it was mercenaries we were dealing with, this seemed like bit too much of wishful thinking.\n\nSome time ago, when the two companies had decided to venture into the city, they both happened to run into the other.\n\nThe Carnaval claim that the Myrioi barged into the inn while they were peacefully drinking and subsequently went around claiming that 'Us pegasi are superior warriors in every way' (their claim, not ours) and when they began pushing back, they started the brawl, ending in the destruction of the inn and the subsequent injuring of half of both companies and maybe a few innocent bystanders in the confusion. In addition, the wine supply has also been destroyed. \n\nThe Myrioi on the other claw are adamant that when they entered the bar for a quick round of liquid joy, the Carnaval unicorns, while drunk, began trying to hit on the female members of their company while trying to pull them over towards them. When the other Myrioi intervened to protect their comrades, the drunk Carnavallers then attacked them, forcing the Myrioi to defend themselves, leading to the brawl.\n\nThe few bystanders that we pulled out of the rubble afterwards, amongst them the bartender swears up and down that someone, they don't know who, threw a single punch that caused them all to descend into the orgy of violence that was the brawl. The bartender mostly grumbled about all his expensive booze being taken and used for weapons.\n\nWhy do mercenaries always have to be so pent-up?"

tradefed.5.d:0 "First the pegasi and unicorns clashed time after time again. Bad as lately come to worst as a corpse has been found in the Astarte district of the city. The markings on it clearly tell the tale of a group of sadistic murderers who did not hold back under any circumstance. The coroner so far counted no less than 70 wounds and more than three instances of blunt force trauma. While it is clear that it is a pony, the murderers mangled the body beyond any recognition, including missing part of the cranial structure and barrel.\n\nThe Myrioi swear up and down that it is their comrade who went missing a few days ago during a bar brawl and they are willing to go far to prove it. To be honest, it does at first seem tempting to just give them the body, and be done with it to avoid having that disgusting mess stink up the mortuary. That is what would have happened, if something else hadn't happened\n\nThe Carnaval had also heard about it and have claimed that the body is in fact their fallen drinking buddy who had ventured too deep into the slum, and was set upon by criminal gangs. While they wanted to retrieve the body, the police had arrived by then and they were forced to withdraw lest they were mistaken for common criminals.\n\nSo far, the police are thoroughly inundated with mercenaries wanting the body given to them.\n\nAnd worst of all, the body is beginning to stink to the high heavens."

And then again with the arrival of Hippolyte Bechard in the northern piracy business. During his tenure, chancellor Guichard had managed to mitigate the situation by using the captured imperial fleet and harbour some privateers and more friendly pirates within Skyfall's port.\n\nToday, the situation has changed like it always does. New threats but also new opportunities. Just like Bechard once did, a new rising star among pirates has offered us to serve under Skyfallian flags, targeting enemies of the state, in exchange for amnesty. We could only go ahead and agree."

tradefed.11.t:0 "The Meeting"
tradefed.11.d:0 "As he laid back on his chair, Ghislain Guichard let out a long sigh. As always, the trade council meeting was talking itself into a corner. Oh, he could get through it of course. It would only take hours of cajoling, negotiating and just a tad of threatening as well as copious amounts of expensive liquor and luxury tobacco. He had done it a thousand times before but he felt so tired of it all. He opened his eyes. The councillors had barely noticed him drifting away. He wished he could feel nostalgia for the old days when he would command them, but the truth was that it had always been like this. The useless but necessary oligarchs had always been bickering, and it always took a lot to have them agreeing in the end. It was all a dance. A soul-crushingly boring dance. And that was all he could take of it for the time being. He rose up and offered them all to adjourn for a moment, and directed them to go to the smoking lounge.\n\nAfter a few minutes of the council loudly vacating the room, he sighed of relief and went to the balcony. As he took out a cigar from his pocket, he heard pawsteps behind him. He knew who it was. As he lit his cigar, he simply asked "Is it the councillor or the family member joining me, my niece?" Genevieve smiled as she approached: "Both". He chuckled as he blew some smoke: "so what is it?" She looked at him in a gentle but concerned way. Oh, how he hated how old that look made him feel.\n\n Genevieve pointed at the council room: "All these griffs... They care for nothing but money." He chuckled again: "Don't we all? Or have you become a priestess of Eyr behind my back?" Genevieve sighed: "Ever since the independence from which they have benefited so much, they have done nothing but impoverish the citizenry." Guichard shrugged: "so? Tale as old as money." She snapped back: "This time is different. Now they have ideas and alternatives. And if we don't start caring and hearing them out, they will revolt again. A revolution far worse than the one before. One that, for all your iron will, even you won't be able to snuff out." The chancellor looked at her sternly: "Is that a threat, Genevieve?" But she didn't flinch: "I'm a councillor. I merely counsel."\n\nGhislain pondered for a moment. Maybe there was some sense in her naivety. Perhaps it was time for a change of pace. But he said nothing and simply smoked until the councillors began to come back from the break. When he went back in, he exchanged a look with Genevieve and then looked upon the assistance waiting for him to speak."

tradefed.12.t:0 "Liquidating Unprofitable Businesses"
tradefed.12.d:0 "After much debate and consideration, Guichard relented to the demands of the austerity lobby within the council and Skyfall's financial class. Of course, the liquidation would only affect unprofitable businesses but it did mean that the Iron Chancellor had to sign off many previously state-owned assets, considerably reducing the spending of the state but also somewhat weakening its hold on the economy. By doing this, however, he had managed to gain favor among some very powerful bankers, especially Ferdinand von Hochsklaue, who personally paid him thanks for the programs, assuring him that by ridding the state of these assets he have only made it more efficient, and that the nation would prosper for it.\n\nSome balked at the reform, claiming that the move meant that Skyfall was depriving itself from future revenue. However, the controversy remained limited as many supported Guichard's decision, explaining that the revenue from the sale would be more significant than any profit from those businesses for at least two decades. Still, the move was unpopular among those unmoved by accountant logic."
tradefed.12.a:0 "Such is life in Skyfall."

tradefed.13.t:0 "Foreign Technicians"
tradefed.13.d:0 "Being one of the largest and richest city in the world, Skyfall has never been a stranger to migration. These last few years, most migrants have been refugees fleeing Cloudbury, Fezera, Prywhen or the Griffonian western coast ever since the Hauklandish raids began. Many of these migrants have simply entered the workforce, trying to get by and make a new life for themselves. But among them are technicians and engineers who have often had a hard time making use of their skills. These griffons and other creatures have attracted the interest of our industrialists who have seen an opportunity to bolster their workforce. One of our industry magnate, Heinrich Kessler, has been at the forefront of this move and he has come forward with a request.\n\nKessler's demands officially is a philanthropic refugee resettlement plan. However, once Guichard parsed through the details of the plan, he saw it for what it is. A plan to target countries either unstable or in conflict and suck them dry of their innovators and scientists. And Guichard had to concede it: it was rather excellent.\n\nMany attacked the plan and accused the migrants of stealing jobs and increasing crime. However, the chancellor stood firm and maintained the old Skyfallian tradition of hospitality towards those in needs."
tradefed.13.a:0 "At least they're useful."

tradefed.14.t:0 "Guichard's Little Fiction"
tradefed.14.d:0 "For years, Guichard had worryingly watched as many businesses in Skyfall began to rely on extravagant amounts of debt financing, a policy strongly encouraged by bankers in Flowena. Various economic agreements between Skyfall, Flowena, Equestria, Feathisia and beyond effectively meant that all businesses had an incentive to fund themselves through debt rather than their shareholders' own assets as interests paid on debt were tax exempts and dividends were not. Effectively, it could be cheaper to borrow money than using your own.\n\nTo resolve this crisis in waiting, Guichard had designed a new fiscal policy, one which would cause a healthy shift in business financing while not breaching any agreement with bankers and business in Flowena, Equestria and the Herzlands: the notional interest. The principle was simple: any business in Skyfall that financed itself could apply for tax deductions on fictitious interests. Effectively, they would tell us that they were borrowing funds from themselves, ask for tax deductions on their interests, our fiscal administration would believe them and they would get their tax deductions. And their money would live happily ever after and have many money children. The End.\n\nNeedless to say, to those griffons sitting in the Council, it was the greatest story ever told."

tradefed.15.d:0 "Bechard has come through on his promise, and ships carrying the valuable cargo have been taken ashore, the vehicles transported with the help of changeling and griffon escorts, employed by Bechard himself. The trip has supposedly been an uneasy one, due to requiring to either navigate through the polar waters or circumnavigate Equus without attracting unwanted attention from Equestria, pirates of all stripes or dragons.\n\nGuichard couldn't help to be wary of Bechard's intentions or extensive connections within the Changeling Lands, whether they were legitimate or not. But still, if it meant having his support and getting your claws on modern military hardware, it was well worth it. And at the very least, he came through on his offer which was more than he could say about many a businessgriff."

Of course, he knew that not everything had always been ethical and that priests and labor movements would always have something to say about it but at least, they kept it discreet and subtle. However, times were changing and international business would only get more ruthless. He needed griffons capable of getting things done by any means necessary. And Walter Whitefeather was one of them. Or so they said. Guichard decided to check.\n\nThey met quietly, far from the Council Palace. Despite his influence, Guichard officially always kept away from the tobacco magnate and - allegedly - kingpin and he wanted to at least keep the appearances. Whitefeather didn't seem to mind. What he was interested in was not political publicity but profit and in exchange for his collaboration, he wanted help for a new pet project of his. It involved loosening some regulations regarding tobacco and chemicals as to make cigarettes with certain... addictive additives in them legal. Guichard, ever the chain smoker, wondered how one would go about making that delicacy even more addictive. Though he didn't care much as he only smoked imported cigars from Puerto Caballo or Macawia."

He turned, thinking he had heard his niece but there was nogriff. She had been rather distant these last few weeks. In a way, it had been a good thing as her suggestions would frequently derailing what could have been fructuous meetings. He sighed and went back to smoking.\n\nGoing back into his office, he pondered. He had secured power once again and wealth was beginning to flow into the city, even more so than before. Suddenly, his thoughts were interrupted by a sudden bout of dizziness, his breath growing short. He attempted to steady himself against a nearby table but failed and collapsed face first into a pile of contract proposals and quarterly reports, the last thing he saw before consciousness faded away..."

tradefed.19.d:0 "After the Chancellor was found unconscious, he was rushed to the hospital. As the news spread to griffons throughout Skyfall, the nation's politics and stock exchange grinded to a halt.\n\n This was not the first time this had happened- the Chancellor had faked his death numerous times in the past, leaving many to have doubts about whether he was truly dying or not, thinking he was once again attempting to drag his enemies out of the shadows.\n\nAs the city lied in stasis, awaiting the verdict, Guichard was lying in his bed at Skyfall General Hospital. He thought about her. Genevieve. Where was she at this terrible hour? He asked his secretary of her whereabouts in a shivering breath. She was at home. Nonsense. "Send for her" he snapped. Twenty minutes passed, he contemplated the ceiling in silence, he felt his claws grow cold. "She must come, I must see her now" he thought. The secretary came back in. "She says she is rather busy at the moment, sir". Guichard used the little energy he had left to furiously rumble. "Very well" He said. "I must then use whatever I have to make her come" he thought. "That wretched... Secretary! Take note". He feverishly dictated a letter where he offered her all he had: his considerable fortune, enough to make her queen. He then waited anxiously for her answer, minutes passed, maybe hours. He was now unable to feel his talons. When the secretary came back in, he was alone, a letter in his claw. She was asking for him to donate his fortune to the Hervormingspartij, as she didn't have the desire to be queen. Guichard was trembling with fear and anger. "I can not. I can't... Write back that I will sign a will giving all my inheritance to whomever she pleases, except them, as long as she comes by my side".\n\nAn eternity later, she was there. Finally. He relaxed as she took his claw. He looked deep in her beautiful eyes, he couldn't hear what she said anymore. He could barely hold the pen to sign his final will; a mere scribble on the bottom of a page. She smiled. And all grew black."

tradefed.20.d:0 "With the Chancellor's death and his will revealed to the public, the city's political machine has whirred back to life. Much to the dismay of the ruling classes and despite challenges in court, the Chancellor's will has been enforced, and his great wealth has been spread among the residents of Skyfall as well as to many charities. Due to the Chancellor's unexpected death, and firm authority over the nation's politics, a successor had not been officially declared prior to his death. It was thought for a moment that Genevieve Guildedwing would succeed him. However, she failed to gather support beyond of the pro-democracy intelligentsia and a part of the general public due to her lackluster performance as the champion of reform in the council. As such,  With the only powerful griffons left in the city being the oligarchs who ruled the city's business, it was clear to most who would inherit the city.

While there are still very notable class divides, many in extreme poverty have made some degree of recovery with the Chancellor's donations, and those in better positions are better off as well. The very fact that one lone griff's inheritance was enough to cause shifts in inequality statistics showed just how much wealth Ghislain Guichard managed to accumulate."

The four are as follow:\n\nHeinrich Kessler, the car magnate and the inventor of the Kessler Model G, the car that symbolized Free Skyfall's success. Despite his anti-union leanings, his program rests on social welfare and wage increases for the workers.\n\nFerdinand von Hochsklaue, the richest and most powerful banker in Skyfall. He presents himself as the spiritual heir of the Iron Chancellor and calls for stability and a gradual end to the isolationist policies of Guichard.\n\nHippolyte Bechard, arms dealer and the leading provider of private security in the Trade Federation. He advocates for a pragmatic militarism and to begin a state-supported private military companies industry.\n\nWalter Whitefeather, the odd griff out among the pack.

In the distance, he could recognize the distinct honk of his cars. This put a smile on his face. He approached the balustrade when he felt something under his paw. An old cigar butt. He picked it up and looked at it with disgust. How the old chancellor managed to live that long while smoking that kind of filth was beyond him. He threw it over the balustrade. No more of those antics.\n\nKessler had ordered the council to meet at two pm. The councillors were still greeting each other when the chancellor banged his gavel. He only gave enough time to the annoyed attendees to get to their seat as it took for him to open his binder. It was time and he wouldn't suffer late fools.\n\n"Dear councillors, I will be brief and I will be direct. While we may all be satisfied with the previous legislature's achievements regarding economic growth, statistics shows that our current economic model is not sustainable on the long term." "I couldn't agree more", let out Genevieve Guildedwing, smiling. Kessler glared at her and coldly responded: "the gentlegriffs of the council will remember that Article 7 alinea b of the Council's Code of Conduct bans speaking during the other councillors' time. Stenographer? Do strike councillor Guildedwing's intervention from the record, thank you."\n\nWithout missing a beat, Kessler went on without paying attention to Genevieve's outraged face: "the industrial revolution has entirely transformed the global market for goods and while current trends do show that our advance in the industrial field allows us to export to foreign well-off creatures with a large margin, this margin will lower itself as countries enter their own phase of industrialization. To counter any drop in our profits, we need a domestic market to become our main source of income. To do so, we need to begin to enact demand-side policies such as living wages that will allow our employees to purchase the products that they produce and beyond. Regardless of any socialist mumbo jumbo, it is the only policy that will allow us to further our economic growth. All in favor, say Aye?"\n\nKessler looked up to see the councillors supporting him.

Ferdinand Von Hochsklaue took a long sip of his Westkeep sparkling wine and put his cigar back in his mouth. He considered the other councillors for a moment. Sure, at first, they had all been looking at the fat griffon eating like there was no tomorrow but after a while, they had all resumed their normal habits. He noticed how each and every one of them were behaving, the chats that were going on. Some were content. Others were not. Bechard and Whitefeather were both pouting and eating silently in their own corner. Kessler had finished eating about half an hour ago and looked bothered. Which he guessed counted as him having a good time. As for the young Guildedwing, she seemed bored out of her mind. He would have to watch for these four sore losers but he was sure that in time, they would adjust.\n\nAfter a moment, he tapped on his glass with his silver spoon to gain everygriff's attention. When he got it, he stood up.\n\n"My dear councillors. I want to thank each and every one of you to have attended this momentous occasion. I am pleased to tell you that I have received the chief of the Veiligheid right before this dinner and he assured me that all signs of unrest, both from criminal elements and labor activists, are on the decline. So it is with pride that I can assure you all that calm has returned."\n\nThe council applauded as Ferdinand paused. "I want to raise a toast to my predecessor, Ghislain Guichard. He will be missed." Again, the council applauded. Ferdinand smiled and drank his glass.\n\n"Now, councillors, I can assure you that Guichard's legacy, that of Skyfallian greatness, will be upholded. That is my promise to you all. Skyfall's present need is not for heroics, but healing; not nostrums, but normalcy; not revolution, but perseveration; not agitation, but adjustment; not surgery, but serenity;not the dramatic, but the dispassionate; not experiment, but equipoise; not submergence in reclusive nationality, but incrementality in responsible internationality.""

On wednesday, a company bus full of workers crashed on a wall due to the brakes not working, killing two and wounding many. Afterwards, many workers refused to use the company bus, causing delays, absences and firings. There has also been many instances of machines breaking down with open accusations of sabotage from the overseers. Due to the event, the labor movements have been reportedly split on the matter, some members accusing eachother of committing unplanned sabotage while the leadership seems split on the idea of supporting or condemning such a movement.\n\nWhile Kessler's griffs are scrambling to solve the situation, productivity has fallen.

There was a waitress waiting tables minding her business when the business griff called to her. "Heya miss! Can I have another cup, I am still feeling groggy after the mornin' shift." said the business griff. The waitress turned and scuttled to see him, smiling and putting her claw on his shoulder. "No problem hun! I'll get you a cup right away. Would you like more cream and sugar with that?" the griffon waitress was soft with her tone and voice as she rubbed his shoulder. "Sure thing missus, I appreciate it." the banker smiled back and was still tired but was at least relaxed. Music was also playing in the background. Octavia, a famous singer from Equestria, her recent song became quite a hit. It could be heard in almost every Skyfall Cafe. Business griff leaned in his chair and closed his eyes, listening to the song. However soon, the music came to an abrupt stop at Octavia's highest beat.\n "Sorry for the abruptness folks but there is breaking news! There have been reports of a series of bank heists throughout Skyfall with masked griffons breaking into various banks around the city and robbing the vaults~" as the radio was blaring the breaking news, the previously relaxed banker almost fell from his chair trembling in shock. He was extremely worried that his bank was hit too and if the money is stolen, he might be unemployed soon. What would happen of his family then?  "Unfortunately, there has been a few deaths too as altercations with a few heroic griffons have had at least 5 civilians killed. Among that manager of one of the banks and two of them came from the Skyfall Central Bank as the robbers took the money and ran. The other two being guards pursuing the gang of robbers, who were found savagely gunned down in an alleyway. The gang is currently being tracked and hunted by the police as we speak" Bussiness griff's heart sank as he found out about the killings. He felt guilty about himself, while he was taking a break others have lost their lives and livelihoods. But he grimaced leaving the idols for the coffee at the table and leaving before the waitress returned. He was no longer in the mood to drink and hurried off to the bank."

Bechard was watching the operation from the hillside. The laboratory had been installed in an old abandoned sawmill. His mercenaries made short work of their guards. The kingpin had not hired bad ones, that much was true, but next to changeling former jaegers, they were vastly out of their league.\n\nThe attacking force positioned themselves near the exits while a changeling changed into one of the guard and pretended to go on a break inside the compound. There, the infiltrator threw an experimental tear-inducing grenade in the venting system and quickly left. In a short moment, the chemists and workers began to flee the building only to get captured or killed if they resisted. Then, the gasmask-wearing mercenaries stormed the building, killing the last guards and subduing the remaining workers. The prisoners were rounded up and forced to climb aboard trucks, their eyes still watery and red from the tear gas. Good stuff, that gas. Meanwhile explosives were set up in the building. All in all, the operation took only twelve minutes. Shock and awe. Just the way he liked it.\n\nAt precisely one o'clock, Bechard whipped up a remote detonator from his pocket and pressed the button. A bright flash and a deafening noise later, the compound was levelled and the forest was beginning to burn. As for the workers, they were up for a one-way ticket on a Sicameonese privateer ship. Bechard smiled and got into his car, smiling. He thought about what Whitefeather had said to him the last time they met. And he thought to himself: \"You may be the danger, Walter...\""

It was Bechard's territory and everygriff that did business there better remember it.\n\nLate during the night, a griff entered the pub. Some turned their heads and others followed until the whole pub had grown silent except for a few drunks. The griff walked up to the table of the Daremaar's main contact in Skyfall: Little Busta.\n\nBusta looked up to the visitor and grumbled: "Bechard's not gonna be happy to know you're there". "Who?", the griff answered and threw a bag containing a form of blue cristal-like substance. Griffons in the audience watched closer while the griff enjoyed the attention. Busta asked: "What's that?"\n"Dope."\n"That ain't opium."\n"This is Blue Sky. The most potent drug ever created and I'm the only one with the recipe."\n"So? Want me to smoke it?"\n"No. I want you to sell it. I have ten crates of the stuff, ready to go for the Daremaar's next trip. If you can handle the heat and distribute it, there will be more after that. I'm talking millions of Idols in a single trip."\n"Bechard doesn't allow drugs in his ships."\n"Then stop working for him and join me."\n"Just who in Maar's name do you think you are?"\n"You know who I am.

The councillors were simply staring at each other, waiting.\n\nTwelve minutes in, the doors were slammed open and Bechard entered with a crate in the arms, followed by two armed mercenaries. As he walked towards his chair, he began to loudly throw objects on the table: toy miniatures of tanks, planes, armored cars, boats but also very real guns. Von Hoschsklaue nearly choked when a machine gun landed in front of him. When he reached his seat, Bechard simply pushed it aside and put his claws on the table.\n\n"My dear friends... I know what you're all thinking. This griffon is insane. And that was before I entered the room. Whoever, I would like you to indulge the crazy griff with a saber and armed friends for just a tiny moment." \n\nHe began to circle around the room, taking some objects from the table and lecturing them about their Skyfallian origin, quality and price. At one point, he stopped behind Kessler and grabbed him, showing him one of his military trucks. "My dear Heinrich, do you know how much these cost?" Kessler glared at him:"Of course. I make them... Nine thousand idols." Bechard grinned: "The double if you know the right people to sell them. Now, imagine this piece of art in every warlord army on the three continent?" He dropped the toy in front of Kessler who picked it up with an intrigued look on his face.\n\n"Councillors! For years, you have sat on the biggest treasure trove of Griffonia! And you can! You can continue your business, all of it. I encourage you too. I just ask you one thing! Let. Me. Sell. Your. Toys. Together, we can offer what this world wants: the best toys of war!

You can rot in peace, now."\n\nAs the councillors gathered in the room, Whitefeather calmly watched them enter from the chancellor's seat. Not all of them were there, most notably Guildedwing. Not that it was a bad thing, he didn't really suffer idealists. As for his rivals, they were there even though they were looking solemn and gloomy, like pouting brats. He smiled at them and enjoyed watching them avoiding his gaze. Except maybe for Bechard. That one, he preferred not to tempt too much. He was the kind of bird that could stab you between the eyes and walk away without an end-game plan.\n\nWhen all were seated, Whitefeather couldn't ignore the tension in the room. He let it go for a couple minutes, just to have them uncomfortably squirm for a moment. Then, he stood up and began to circle around the table as he spoke.\n\n"My dear friends...

He would let the people know that communism in all its disgusting forms, from syndicalist to anarchist, has no place in Skyfall, nor has it in any civilized society. We shall not let them speak, protest nor thrive. Whatever hiding spots the Vakbonden may think they will have, they will be found. \n\nWe will let the Veiligheid arrest them all, big and small, young and old.

And now, with the Wildcat strikes, they had shown their true colours : beating up so-called "scabs" for just wanting to work, sabotaging equipment or throwing stones at policegriffs and soldiers sent to disband the picket lines. Well, the Iron chancellor was not impressed and he would do the same to them as he had to the Republicans.\n\nHe sent his agents into the evening, tracking down all the Vakbonden's ringleaders and one especially: Gaubert Girard. And for all the syndies' talk, they were poor preys. The assassination had been carried out without any problem.

Fortunately, there no longer was a council and Guichard was at last no longer powerless.\n\nAnd so, he devised a plan to suppress the temples without alienating the press and the public.

A powerful orator, he has advocated the strengthening of the post of Chairgriffon and for the comprehensive planning of the economy by the state, which gives him strong support amongst the new Army and Navy.\n\n Second is De Altesburg of the RSP. An advocate of Social democracy he is the most moderate of the three candidates and has the support of whatever remains of the bourgeoisie in Skyfall along with those who might not fully support this whole "Communism" thing.\n\nLast is Rosebeak of the primary, syndicalist faction. While he is generally in the center of the debate between Growder and De Altesburg, all Griffons know he will not "compromise". He is an advocate of traditional anarcho-syndicalist ideas and wishes to put the unions in charge of the entire nation as the national government."

tradefed.55.d:0 "Following the chaos of the revolution and the destruction it caused to the land, the first thing on everyone's mind is how the economy will recover. As the big three all come forward with their own plans, this one will be a slugger.\n\nFirstly, Growder comes forward with his plan to centralize and control the economy through mass-nationalization of industry and resources. This has strong support from the military who could easily benefit from the nationalization of resources.\n\nSecondly is Rosebeak. He speaks of a traditional anarcho-syndicalist economy but in a way that has never been tried, he wishes for everything to be unionized, down to the very core of society and economics. This of course earns the support of the unions and many militias throughout the nations.\n\nLastly is De Altesburg who unlike the others has delivered no firey speeches about his economic policy, he has simply written it out and presented it to the congress. Befitting of his demenour the plan is one that is extremely moderate compared to his opponents, advocating for a market economy with limited private ownership while still maintaining many of the union values of Rosebeak's plan. This has the support of those involved in the professions of trade before the revolution and the many more moderates unions and those who's success relies on trade.\n\nHow shall Skyfall's economy be run?"

tradefed.57.d:0 "A new conflict has been growing within the congress, this time chiefly over Skyfall's foreign policy. For once Rosebeak and Growder seem to be on the same side, with both being set against the RSP. The conflict arose over how Skyfall should prosecute revolutions in other Griffonian states. Rosebeak and Growder are full heartingly behind the idea of expanding the revolution while De Altesburg has called for patience and caution.\n\nIn any other circumstance the great revolutionary fervour would have easily overwhelmed the calls for peace, but the revolution is still in recent memory. While the arguement for the revolution is generally stronger on the surface, many in the Army and Navy have cautioned Growder to simply fall behind the RSP on this one as they do not feel ready, and many unionshave told Rosebeak it could ruin them if war was to come to early.\n\nHow shall Growder and Rosebeak vote?"

tradefed.58.d:0 "In the final week over the congress the greatest debate has emerged, the debate over the power of the griffon to be elected by this congress. How much power should he hold over the state? Now of course with the autocracy of the Iron Chancellor in recent memory, no griffon will ever have total control, but the arguements keep flaring.\n\nGrowder argues that the Chairgriffon needs expansive powers in order to protect the state from the evils of capitalism and monarchy. He says that the Chairgriff's sacred responsibility to defend the people must have no obstacles in his way.\n\nOn the opposite end Rosebeak denounces Growder as a tyrant and a demagogue and has argued that the powers of the chairgriff should be limited and that power should be held by a legislature of union representatives. And that the chairgriff should only act as a figurehead to guide the people.\n\nAt the end of the congress, wanting to avoid hostilities after its conclusion, De Altesburg proposed his own plan. One that would give the Chairgriff the same powers as any other member of the assembly of unions proposed by Rosebeak, while also granting the post the powers as the head of the military, a major point made by Growder's army and Navy backers.\n\nWho convinces the most griffs?"

And so without further delay, the first Chairgriffon of Skyfall..." He pauses for just half a second and takes a breath, not long enough for anyone to notice, but just long enough to put suspense into the air. "...is Adalbert Growder. Congradulations to all the candida..."\n\nNot one heard to rest of his speech. In the center of the plaza Growder's supporters began to chant their signature slogan "Louder for Growder!". It drove some insane but it was a strong rallying cry for a griffon with that same personality, a roaring crowd hyped up on revolutionary fervor. From the stage the counter could see Rosebeak walking away from the plaza, not so much dissapointed in his loss, but dissapointed in Skyfall. De Altesburg had walked over to congratulate Growder, always the gentlegriff he was. But Growder? His reaction was an anomaly. He was crying. This firey and abrasive griffon was now crying tears of joy in the center of Skyfall. And the counter had hope for the future."

As the stage was thrown down for him, people began to gather; shocked by this appearance of the leader of their nation. And so he began to speak. He railed against the oligarchs who had used this port to escape revolutionarly justice, spoke ill of those who would let Skyfall fall to "corrupting influences" and made sure to get the crowd as riled up as possible. Whipping them into a frenzy, so vicious many doubted who they had supported only a month or two before.

And slowly, as the council reconvenes, more and more griffs begin to vote with the centralizing of Skyfall's government, into positions then handed out to those same voters...\n\nBut somegriff let the secret out.

And now it is Growder's turn.\n\nAs Growder walked along the piers of Skyfall city, newly repaired after the chaos of revolutionary struggle; he saw his old friend, captain Veren Regeling, in command of one of the nation's greatest battlecruisers. And while he passed, this griffon and his sailors did something that hadn't been done since the days of the Oligarchs.\n\nThey fired off the ship's guns in the form of a salute to Growder's presence. In the days following this event, Growder made many more appearances alongside the navy, with them showing their support for his increases in their funding, and their role as protectors of the new state.\n\nAnd in the shadows, many griffons began to worry what this militarism would mean."

They are all aware of the issue, Growder's opposition is angered, and if it reaches a high point, they could even try to remove him from his post. A plan is formed in hushed whispers, and the griffs return to their homes. But this night will be without sleep for all of them.\n\nThe following day a bill is submitted to the council, a law so staggering that a split has been forced. You are either with Growder or against him.\n\nCalled the Machtigingswet, it decrees that the nation is being held back by traitors within the ranks of its government, and that the chairgriffon has the right and duty to weed them out. Giving Growder unrivaled power to reshape the government and the nation as he pleases.\n\nWhether out of belief or fear of having their positions taken away, one by one griffons cast their votes for the bill until it passes by a two-vote margin."

Boreaists have organized and hide within the party," He says.\n\nCries of "Impossible!" and "Preposterous" fill the air in the room, some of them having been part of the revolution ever since it had to hide under the Chancellor and before that even.\n\n"But fret not Comrades. Our Bewakers have been hard at work the last few months rooting out the corruption within. They have arrested reactionaries, some of them working deep, deep undercover" He says as he circles the table.\n\nHe comes to a stop, as he stands before a great wooden door. "In fact, there are only a few reactionaries remaining. Those who sook to keep us divided while they worked on crushing the workers under their claws."\n\nOpening the door, he shouts "Bewakers! Take these to the cells!" The heavily armed Bewakers stream in, grabbing the 'traitors' by their neckfeathers and dragging them out, despite protests. The reactionaries have been crushed.

Those in the party, that wanted to form a counterrevolutionary movement have been discovered, rooted out, to make sure that they will not be able to bring back the Chancellor's rule. However, now, we must turn to the future as a new dawn rises on Skyfall.

Then, as the last part, they march to the old Chancellery, where they smash the front door. And then, it culminates. A griffon is selected to plant a red flag on top, before the parade ends.

While the empire has decayed under the rule of the decadent nobles, taking advantage of the late emperor's sickness, the pious Archon's regency has caused the nobles to flee, hiding in their ancestral lands from righteous retribution- but we shall be strong! We must stay loyal to the brave and godly Archon, and to the gods who have guided us thus far- to be strong against the degenerate nobles who wish to destroy the heart of Griffonkind, and to have no mercy for those who seek to destroy Boreas's chosen and blessed empire. The anti-Archon coalition not only wishes to take power for themselves, but to subvert the righteous order of the empire in its entirely- the young emperor is nothing but a threat they surely would dispove of if given the chance, discounting his divinely mandated rulership for their own greed...\n\nForeign Bankers Plot to Destroy Culture!\nA small envoy sent from Flowena was intercepted as it crossed the border, carrying several secretive letters- addressed to the former owner of a place of a degenerate cabaret, closed down after our revolution. The letters detailed hopes that the bankers could finance the griffon's exile to the city of Skyfall, and hopes that they could use their money to bring down Skyfall, and the empire itself with it! If we are to win this cultural struggle against those who wish to destroy us, we must stay vigilant and the treasonous within- syndicalists, atheists and secularists, those loyal to the bourgeoisie and those who would oppose the Archon's rule. Only with a pure and sturdy foundation can our nation spread her wings!"\n\nThe Onweder, a newspaper dedicated to promoting loyalty to the empire in the now returned province of Skyfall, has began to make circulations through our land- beginning its first publications in the titular city itself. The paper, met with warm if disinterested reception by the public, and quite good reception from many in the Boreaiste, will continue to be published for the time being, soon being distributed throughout the countryside as well, from Vederstad to Grifftonia and the many farmlands which surround them."

tradefed.89.d:0 "Gertjan Desramaux often found himself on evening strolls to the temple of Boreas, a welcome break from his busy life as leader of the new Skyfall. Today, the sun had already set, but the lights of Skyfall never went out, and as such he felt no danger walking her streets down to the temple. As he approached, he did not hear the silence of prayer and contemplation, or the laughter of those enjoying life- but rather what sounded like a confrontation, angry voices in the faint night wind. Worried, his pace grew quicker, approaching the open temple square...\n\nHowever, as he turned the corner into the open air, he breathed a sigh of relief- for, rather than any hooligans or fouldoers, he saw a small group- a policegriff, and two batponies, looking at him with a mixture of anger and fear. They seemed to be in a rather heated argument, however, as Desramaux watched, the griffon shook his head, pointing his claw away with a stern, almost disappointed expression- to which, the bats meekly backed off, walking off and melting into yet another street, into the crowds of the city.\n\nDesramaux approached the temple with a small smile at that- bat ponies, or "thestrals," as they asked to be called, while he did not assume them all to be bad, of course- were well known for prostitution in Skyfall, their business being rather popular with many before the revolution, their exotic allure attracting commoner and bourgeoisie alike. However, now, it was clear that their "work" was not wanted in Skyfall- and as such, the foul temptresses of the night were to find honest work, or to offer their degenerate services elsewhere. While the bats were not the only prostitutes of the city, they were by far the most infamous- or rather, Desramaux shudders, famous- of the degenerates. As he stepped up to the temple step, he smiled, knowing that there would no longer be such foul temptation on the steps to Boreas's home..."

It had been lucky that the bomb, planted deceptively within a car, had not been more deadly- it had been detonated during mid-day, when most were at work.\n\nThe last in a series of terrorists operations by opposition to the government, the bombing was only evidence of the inevitable- resistance needed to be found, and quickly snuffed out, or else they would continue to haunt Skyfall and her people. Quickly passing into the expansion of the rights of the militia towards civil issues, those who had fought in the revolution were once again brought to call for the good of the republic, rifles in claw... \n\nA week later, screams once again rang through the streets of Skyfall- though this time, hardly those of innocents. A group of militiagriffs had broken down the door, having been tipped off to the activities of an underground syndicalist cell. Caught unaware, the radicals inside were quickly apprehended- putting up little fight. This scene was not, unique, however- and it would not be the last of its kind. Already taking to the streets of Grifftonia as well as Skyfall, businesses suspected to be loyal to the old order had been investigated- former union meeting halls converted to better use, and investigations started on those with suspicious pasts or loyalties. Skyfall will suffer no terrorists, masquerading as 'civil resistance' or not- they were all enemies of the empire."

Luckily, after realising the futility of their fight, the partisans quickly surrendered, with no injury to our soldiers. Despite similar victories across the country, however, there is still very much to be done- while the city of Skyfall has been cleansed of most open resistance, there are still many in the city plotting in the shadows, and outside of the city there are still pockets of open resistance. We have already mobilised many former militiagriffs who fought for our cause, as well as many of our state's police force, to start investigating those who have previously shown sympathy to the syndicalist cause- while the illegality of syndicalist movements has helped, many continue to operate in secret or under a guise of loyalty.

tradefed.92.d:0 ""The "Iron Chancellor", as many called him, was possibly the greatest traitor in Skyfall's history. His first act of treason was against the empire, under which Skyfall flourished- as Republicans ransacked the empire, he announced his secession, in their time of greatest need, leaving the empire to crumble for the sake of lining his associates' pockets. Then, as he took total control of the nation, he began work to destroy chance of any popular control- whenever resistance would begin, he faked his death, then crushed any who came out of the shadows to attempt to bring change. And nothing is worse than the crimes committed in the last time of his life- the extralegal monitoring of temples, infringing on the right to worship in peace for the sake of secular power- and throwing out our glorious leader, for the crime of wanting to bring a new future to Skyfall. It is a crime that today, so many griffons still believe his propaganda- the Iron Chancellor's claw was not one which guided Skyfall- all it has achieved was the strangling of her people."\n\nWith the late Guichard's propaganda still fresh in the mind of most citizens, many still question the necessity of the revolution- even after their experience with the poverty and degeneracy all too common in the years of his chancellorship. To help these people, we have begun reeducation- lessons on his acts from an unbiased perspective, changes in school programs to expose his cruelties, and publishing books further educating people on that which he wanted to keep hidden. The chancellor has always been a powerful symbol, owing to his imposing and firm demeanor- even after his death. But now, after his death, we deliver the final blow to his personality cult, freeing the people's hearts from his grip once and for all..."

Having been intercepted as he attempted to cross the southern border into Griefwald, he was quickly transported back to Skyfall, where he faced trial- however, unlike his fiery defense of Rosebeak's imprisonment, few protested as he was arrested for life, for his crimes in inciting the socialist revolution, organising the syndicalist cause and treason and disloyalty to our new state. The once-great orator, not unlike in demeanor to our leader, has finally been silenced- once and for all."

tradefed.94.d:0 "With our claw tightening around the syndicalists, it is time to address the griffons who prop up the "moderate" resistance to our victory- Skyfall's former oligarchs. While we are yet to uncover where any of them have escaped to, in their wake a representative lawyer has been assigned to defend them against allegations in the coming trial, organised so that we can prosecute them if we ever capture them.\n\nFirst, comes the obviously criminal of Skyfall's notable bourgeoisie- the notorious Whitefeather, and Bechard, one of Griffonia's greatest mercenary captains. Their crimes were blatant even before their rise to power- Bechard was well known to associate with smuggers, even discounting his mercenaries. Whitefeather, of course, was the leader of a vast criminal enterprise, now all but destroyed with our purges. His product led many innocent griffons down a dark path, all so he could line his own pockets with their blood money- blood money extracted by thugs. And above all else, the two were guilty of the high crime of treason- for fighting against our forces during the revolution, and supporting the previous government.\n\nNext, was the banker- Ferdinand von Hochsklaue- for whom Desramaux had quite the bone to pick. Corruption- Von Hochsklaue's first crime was the incessant use of bribery to get his way, inciting political corruption in many officials. Second was conspiracy- he was known to consort with many other bankers and industrialists throughout the city, using their power to entrench their positions, and to trod on the common griffon. Finally, was the high crime of treason- for supporting the previous government both politically and monetarily, and supporting the previous government against us in the revolution.\n\nNext, was Kessler- by all accounts- that is, the accounts of those conducting the trial- the most trustworthy of the four griffons today. While hardly good, he acted by and large within the law. While he was well known for his rather stern treatment of workers, and especially unions, by and large those were measures against the syndicalist threat, something which could not be opposed. However, his legitimate business practices aside, he was in fact guilty of one most important crime- treason against the Boreaiste, and by extension the empire, due to his full support of the chancellor's regime even as it seceded from the empire, and against our forces in the subsequent revolution.\n\nWith the charges against the oligarchs fully solidified, if sometimes contrived, it was settled- the oligarchs were to face life in prison, if they ever were to show their face in Skyfall again. Though, considering their connections, that was not a likely outcome..."

However, few of those concerns are seen today, as Skyfall now stands proudly- once again the empire's shining gem on the western sea. Loyalty to the empire has taken us far already, and as we snuff out the last domestic resistance, it is sure to take us further still- especially with the Archon leading the empire's helm. With Boreas in our hearts, we shall continue to steer Skyfall's fate, as if the captain of one of our nation's many vessels- towards the rising sun of the empire."

You have been most welcome to me in my stay here, more than any where else in the empire, I am sad to say. The seat of Griffenheim has been taken by the enemy- and, while I am not happy to lay this burden on the faithful, I am afraid it is a necessity- we must fight to retake it. Here, in Skyfall, the faithful flourish- we must leverage Skyfall, then, for the cause of Boreas's will.\n\nWe must act now, or else all will be lost- if we allow those in Griffenheim to recover, to become entrenched- then our fight is all but lost. We must struggle, not for ourselves, but for all of the empire- for the fate of the empire itself, and of Griffonia, for if we waver- the empire will be doomed, to be defined by those who rule it now, instead of the faithful who have always served it.\n\nIt is such that I must, with the greatest difficulty, oh people of Skyfall, ask you- will you fight for Boreas?

Overall, the rally was a success in helping to reinvigorate the spirits of those involved- however, nearing the end, to the confusion of those not involved, they began to chant- "Boreas wills it!", no doubt in support of the Archon's recent announcement of hostility with the empire. As much as the support from the rally and organisation have been a boon to our cause, the rally left several rather annoyed griffons throwing their pillows over their ears- the chant had began rather late in the night, and in the middle of the city no less."

For these gunshots were not those of criminals, but of our loyal militia, having raided those believed to be loyal to the treasonous syndicalists- and having shot those who confirmed their fears. Sadly, many children of the gods were lost that night, but it is a burden we must bear- the rot of syndicalism must be purged from Skyfall if we are to save the empire itself, after all. Some may lose brothers, or children, or friends- but the threat of syndicalism is too high to risk when it comes to what is necessary- our destiny of restoring the empire.

While organised as a political party, now that the Archonate has taken the place of the government, there is little need for any other political bodies. And their militias, while useful in the revolution and in rooting out the rot, must be properly integrated into our police and military if they are to act as a cohesive force worthy of our state...\n\nAs such, we have come to a deal with the Boreaiste, Desramaux and Eros personally agreeing on the terms- the political party would be disbanded, fully absorbed into the new Archonate governate. The militias were a different story- first, the most professional of the militia were to be integrated into the army- mostly small in number, most notable in the new officers brought in by ambitious former militia leaders. Secondly, the much more prevalent minor, localised groups would stay as they were- but rather as an arm of the temples, instead of as the Boreaiste. Those who pledged their loyalty to the Archon would retain their limited local jurisdiction, to keep the peace, defend in the case of invasion and- most importantly- act on our wishes throughout the nation."

And worse, many still openly refute and insult our new government, decrying the Archon as a tyrant worse than Guichard ever was. If we are ever to move forward as a nation, we must once and for all destroy the evil at the root of our society- moral degeneracy, atheism, and syndicalism- and if we are to act quick enough to save the empire, it sadly cannot be done by peaceful means...\n\nWith the orders given, they were quickly relayed throughout the entire nation- by radio and by messenger- to the militia throughout our cities and countryside. It started with Skyfall herself, where the news spread quickly- at first, the militias stayed organised, following the commands of their respective leaders and of our officials. But soon, as they began to uncover the plotting of the syndicalists, it became apparent what they were to do. As arrests began, at first it seemed like the purge before- loaded into trucks, to be shipped off to a prison for the politically dissident, like their comrades before them. But as they arrived at their destination, they found themselves roughly corraled out of the truck, and to a nearby wall. Exhausted from the journey, the griffons did little to resist as they were lined up by soldiers- and could do little to resist as they were fired upon. While not the greatest show of the kindness of the gods, the necessity of the act was obvious to all involved- they were no threat to the people of Skyfall now, and Boreas's grace would no doubt be bestowed upon their poor souls."

While Skyfall's traditional schooling contains courses on the native dialect of the land, the Archon has passed a decree that all schooling from now must teach mandual bilingualism- both in the student's native tongue, and in the Herzlandisch dialect of Griffenheim and the Herzland. The first step in his ambitious mission to culturally unite the desperate regions of the empire- if he is to ever succeed in retaking it- this has been applauded by loyalists and the clergy alike, many of whom studied in the Herzland themselves.\n\nAlong with classes for children, optional schooling for adults- sponsored by the state as well- has been created. Proficiency in the Herzlandisch dialect not only promotes cultural unity- but brings many personal benefits as well, most notably the ability to talk easily with those from the region, and have an easier time rising in the ranks of Skyfall's government, from politician to the military. While far from instant, the promotion of the imperial language has already proven itself to be a boon for the people of Skyfall, all thanks to the Archon's wisdom."

The sheer population, as well as varied schedules of her citizens, made that rather unfeasible. However, a much more practical way to assure that the gods were in our people's hearts was instead fallen back on- every citizen would be required to attend a temple service for one day a week. While rather simple, if controversial, the law passed into law with little grumbling from the public. Many complain about how unnecessary it is, and how it is an infringement upon personal autonomy- much like what you might expect from a young chick, pettily squabbling to avoid heading to the services. However, despite some backlash, it seems to have had atleast some positive effect- those who had not previously made time for the temple seem to have been pleasantly surprised by the connection they have reached with the gods, with the help of our clergy. This has also, of course, been highly popular among our clergy, who are all too happy to have increased attendence to their sermons, and for their importance in society to be elevated even further."

The old chancellor even found himself smiling and blushing from the genuine appreciation all those griffs were showing. Later on, as he listened to some destitutes' story, he pondered on how out of touch he had been for all these years. So much suffering and it didn't even cost that much to help alleviate it.

He was somewhat hesitant about the political risks he had taken but it was too late for regret. The act was signed and now officially Skyfall law.\n\nOne final meeting had been scheduled, one arranged by Genevieve. Expecting a labor organizer to come, he had prepared for a work meeting dedicated to possible recourse against the bill but much to his surprise in walked a griffon dressed in what looked like worker's clothes, mumbling apologies about not having much else to wear to the meeting. As Ghislain asked him to sit, putting his trust in his niece that this wasn't something some kind of joke, the worker wholeheartedly thanked him for allowing him to speak to him, and voiced his support for the new programs. It transpired from the discussion that the griffon was a common worker who Genevieve had brought in to speak to Guichard. Though he considered turning him away after discovering the truth, the conversation quickly turned to how he could further help the working people of Skyfall, and he grew interested as the worker explained the hardships of the lower classes. After a while of conversing with this seemingly random worker, he decided to send him away.

Or if he needed to shoot them all. She blinked at him in response and he went back to his notes smirking.\n\nThe meeting itself went surprisingly well. The leaders of Skyfall's labor movements had been more than amiable and reasonable, far from the jeers and insults Ghislain was expecting from them. After the initial introductions they quickly got to business, explaining how most of their concerns were with the well-being of the workers, and how they would be willing to put aside radical ideas if meaningful reforms were passed regarding working conditions, wages and union rights. Ghislain was skeptical at first but he listened earnestly and found himself being more sympathetic to some of their reasonable demands. He promised to offer some good ways to address their concerns and demands in their next meetings.\n\nThe meeting didn't went without controversy. The press extensively reported on it, some papers going as far as to suggest that Guichard had in fact turned to communist sympathies.

If he made amends with workers and destitutes, couldn't he also make amends with the old Empire? What point would there be in sparking outrage from the loyalists still remaining in the Trade Federation. None.\n\nAnd so, in the dead of night, Ghislain took his pen and began to write a letter from an old griff to a young fledgling in mourning. He wrote his condolences and hopes for a less brutal future. It was painful to make amends for old transgressions for which he didn't feel much remorse but it was the cost of mending relations with their neighbour.\n\nThe next morning, he met with his administration and made plans to send some diplomatic gifts and funds to Imperial charities in honor of the late emperor."

However, after discussing the matter with his niece, he had come to understand that it had gotten a bit out of control.

And yet, it was thanks to her that he had finally lived up to his duties as a true statesgriff. He extended a claw to greet her, when suddenly a sharp pain struck him- he rested against the desk, suddenly extremely dizzy, vision beginning to fade and only hearing her niece calling for help in the distance..."

tradefed.112.d:0 "After the Chancellor's untimely collapse, his niece quickly had him rushed to the hospital, where the best medicine in Griffonia was put to use in attempting to save his life- and yet, it was not enough, as he was pronounced dead soon after, much to the dismay of his niece, one of the few griffons allowed to see him in the hospital. With the media abuzz and old enemies of the state coming out of hiding, things have began to take a turn for the worse. With Genevieve still too rocked by her uncle's death to begin the process of fighting back against his now resurgent enemies, Skyfall too begins to mourn the death of the Iron Chancellor.\n\n With the death of the Chancellor, his will had begun to be executed, and with its sole beneficiary of Genevieve Guildedwing named, the next chancellor was obvious. With the wealth of the previous chancellor now hers, and with the obvious status of being his desired heir, much of the city supports her, though she has made many powerful enemies with her reform-minded ideals..."

tradefed.113.d:0 "With the Iron Chancellor's death, the enemies he made with his recent reforms have come out of hiding, ready to strike. Businesses, primarily those of the powerful oligarchs of the city, have began to boycott the new government, accusing both Guichard and the new chancellor, Genevieve, of "selling out to the syndicates" and "betraying free market ideals". The selfish oligarchs have shut down our industry and banking systems, holding the nation hostage until they get what they desire- that is, power and a rollback of our recent reforms. Even worse, crime has taken a massive spike as pirates and thugs have come out of hiding, on the orders of crime-lords who know their time is near. If the chancellor is to continue her ambitious reforms and continue helping her nation's people, she must first neuter the oligarchs and show that she has inherited her uncle's iron will..."

tradefed.114.d:0 "To even begin to stop the pirates who now plague our waters, we need to secure a power base to defeat them from- and where better than our docks? Though the pirates use intimidation and fear to attempt to control the workers, by generously bribing those who work in the dockyards we can hopefully prevent the outlaws from gaining ground, and build support in the workers there."

tradefed.115.t:0 "The Inside Job"
tradefed.115.d:0 "With the explosion of piracy, many pirate captains are encountering a problem: the opportunities are numerous but griffonpower is lacking. Due to the lack of trust between pirates from Skyfall and Haukland, most Skyfallian pirate captains have decided to recruit locally only and due to the kingpins recruiting themselves, the scum's standards have been lowered. This had created an opportunity for us to infiltrate their ranks. Some intelligence officers from the Guichard era considered the feat unfeasible but it turned out that in some cases, our informants and saboteurs only had to show up gruff-looking in seedy bars before getting offered a position on a pirate ship."

tradefed.117.d:0 "The orders have been sent, and our police have taken to the streets, enforcing order- especially in the docks and areas nearby, where the activity of smugglers and pirates was most rampant. This move was, luckily, a success, and we have regained nominal control. Though this is not the end of the fight against the outlaws, it is a gesture to both our people and the criminals that we are prepared to keep the peace."

tradefed.118.d:0 "One prominent griffon and officer in our army, affectionately known to many as "Little Busta", has for long been associated with mercenary groups, and been somewhat friendly to smugglers, but with our recent fight against similarly aligned groups, it is time to handle things. By arranging a convenient accident to deal with this loose end and some of his , we can make sure he won't cause any trouble in the future."

tradefed.121.d:0 "The burden of responsibility has suddenly been cast upon the young Genevieve, and yet she bears it stoically- determined to prove to her nation and the world that she is prepared to transform Skyfall into a modern state, and to uplift her people, she has urgently prepared a speech. Addressing the nervous crowds on a dreary city morning, she boldly proclaimed her ambitions to take back the city from the traitorous snakes who wish to take it for themselves, and to restore Skyfall's prosperity- not for the sake of the capitalists, but for the sake of the people. She has also openly stated wishes to cooperate with both the temples and the socialist movements in the city against their common enemy. As her speech came to a close, she went off script, beginning to speak of her dream for Skyfall- a nation where people can be free and prosperous, without treacherous monopolists holding it back- a nation that can truly call itself the shining gem of Griffonia. While this speech has been controversial, most especially among hardline capitalists and reactionaries, it has helped to encourage the people of Skyfall to hold out for a better future, and has won over some within the temples and labor movements, making cooperation more likely."
tradefed.121.a:0 "To a better Skyfall!"

tradefed.122.t:0 "A Meeting With Girard"
tradefed.122.d:0 "The meeting of our chancellor and Girard, one of the forefront griffons of the Vakbond, has been awaited with bated breath by prominent citizens both in our government and the labor movement itself- and the day has finally arrived. Meeting on Girard's terms, the chancellor arrived with hopes to mend relations between labor and government, promising concessions if they were to pledge support to her government. Much to the chagrin of the revolutionary left, Genevieve and Girard left the meeting having come to an agreement, on the chancellor's terms. This has caused a mass exodus of revolutionaries from the Vakbond Raad, who believe Girard to be a traitor to true socialist ideals, but it has also attracted many workers to the new more moderate interpretation of the party- one that has pledged its support to Genevieve against the capitalists."
tradefed.122.a:0 "I'm glad we could see eye to eye."

tradefed.123.t:0 "A Meeting With the Clergy"
tradefed.123.d:0 "The chancellor and several representatives of our government have finally met with a group of prominent clergy officials, wishing to forge and agreement with our government. While many support the Parti Boreasiste out of principle, they have made their disagreements with the radical Desramaux clear- and have come up with an agreement. They will support Genevieve's government on the terms that she allows the Parti Boreasiste to operate freely- under the leadership of the more moderate and cooperative Julia Van Tieghem. Along with several other minor concessions to the temples, this agreement has been decided on, and so the clergy of our city are now in support of our government."
tradefed.123.a:0 "Glad we could come to an agreement."

tradefed.124.t:0 "The United Front"
tradefed.124.d:0 "This day marks the official rise of the united front- a loose alliance of the HP, Vakbonden and Boreasiste in support of Genevieve's government. United by their hatred of the petty capitalists who have brought our nation to ruin, with their support our government has gained much more legitimacy and support, opening the way to squash the snakes who have taken our nation hostage."
tradefed.124.a:0 "Together to victory!"

tradefed.125.t:0 "An Honest Accident"
tradefed.125.d:0 "With our plans set in motion, loyalists working within Kessler's factories have made necessary preparations, and on our commands a series of 'accidents' occured, creating a major yet also temporary setback for his production. More important is the disruption it has caused in his supporters, with workers wondering about his safety standards and outside supports having second thoughts about his competence."
tradefed.125.a:0 "Accidents happen."

tradefed.126.t:0 "News Just In"
tradefed.126.d:0 "With information gathered by our informants, many Skyfall news publications have been making public information the oligarchs would rather not- and so rumor has become fact. While there is still some question to the validity of the information, and some cry out that it is slander at the claws of political opponents, this has caused a stir within the public, with some prominent figures renouncing their support in response."
tradefed.126.a:0 "That has to hurt..."

tradefed.127.t:0 "The Grand Heist"
tradefed.127.d:0 "In a shocking turn of events, one of the greatest banks in Skyfall has been robbed blind- a group of mysterios griffons working for an unknown group have managed to secure much of the wealth inside for themselves and whoever they work for, at the same time weakening the bankers in control... In unrelated news, a very generous donation has recently been made to our government."
tradefed.127.a:0 "Good work!"

tradefed.128.t:0 "The Associates"
tradefed.128.d:0 "We have contacted several business associates of the oligarchs, many of whom have began to question their leadership. With the promise of idols and protection from government action, our plan has worked, and many have renounced their loyalty and turned to our side. This is yet another blow to the oligarchs..."
tradefed.128.a:0 "I'm glad we could reach an agreement."

tradefed.129.t:0 "Bail Them Out"
tradefed.129.d:0 "While our actions have caused some within the leftern wing of the united front to question our motives, our government has bailed out many of the smaller industrialists and bankers who had come on hard times following our sabotage. With this, we have won our government their support, and weakened our opposition- we are almost ready to finally take back Skyfall."
tradefed.129.a:0 "Think nothing of it."

tradefed.130.t:0 "The New Deal"
tradefed.130.d:0 "With many of their former supporters pledging loyalty to our government, and their business going downhill with recent "unfortunate events", Kessler and Ferdinand von Hochsklaue have officially announced their support to the government, and stopped resisting our new chancellor and come running back to our government with their tails between their legs. With this, we have the cards in our claws- and we can deal with the issue of monopoly once and for all.\n\n With recent legislation, the greatest threats within the business sector of Skyfall have been significantly weakened, with their political power reduced and protections put against future monopolies being created. With this we have finally destroyed an issue that has plagued Skyfall for decades, securing the power of the federal government above capital."
tradefed.130.a:0 "Run along now, I have a country to run."

tradefed.131.t:0 "The War On Crime"
tradefed.131.d:0 "With increases to funding and more ambitious deployment plans in our police force, it is official- we have began a war on crime. With these increased efforts being noticed by the crime lords, they have retaliated, and it is clear that we must continue our hardline approach to smash these petulant criminals."
tradefed.131.a:0 "The die is cast."

tradefed.132.t:0 "Arresting the Dealers"
tradefed.132.d:0 "All must start somewhere, and if we are to handle this issue we should attack their revenue stream- primarily drugs. Though we do not have enough information or resources to take on their dens and production, by arresting petty street dealers we can atleast take care of the worst of it, somewhat reducing the profits of the organisations at large."
tradefed.132.a:0 "It's a start..."

tradefed.133.t:0 "Cracking the Dens"
tradefed.133.d:0 "Our police have been given orders to search for drug dens and break them up, further escalating the war on drugs. Though some grumble about civil liberties, this program has been mostly a success, and we have managed to crack down on the worst crime in many lower income neighborhoods. This is another step to a safe and crime-free Skyfall."
tradefed.133.a:0 "Less drugs on the street."

tradefed.134.t:0 "The War Intensifies"
tradefed.134.d:0 "The chancellor has made official statements to the police encouraging a more hardline approach to crime, and has replaced leadership with those more cooperative to these efforts. With this new leadership the police have been stirred into action, causing some controversy both within and outside of the force itself, but also proving that the government will stick by its guns on the issue of crime."
tradefed.134.a:0 "No more half measures!"

tradefed.135.t:0 "The Source"
tradefed.135.d:0 "Our police have arrived at the various labs throughout our nation armed with more than normal weapons- on official orders by both the chancellor and the chief of police, along with securing the labs from the criminals, they have also been ordered to scorch and destroy as much equipment, product and supplies as possible, making sure that even if they manage to recover their hideouts they cannot use them, and sending a very clear message."
tradefed.135.a:0 "Burn it all!"

tradefed.136.t:0 "Dealing With The Pushers"
tradefed.136.d:0 "Our police have apprehended many of the pushers supplying the city-side dealers, and more are on the way. With these arrests we have majorly hurt the bottom line of the gangs these pushers work for, giving us even more of an upper claw..."
tradefed.136.a:0 "One less threat to the establishment."

tradefed.137.t:0 "The End Of the Road"
tradefed.137.d:0 "With his criminal empire crumbling before him, Whitefeather had taken to a bold move in an attempt to recover, personally taking part in a raid on a prominent rival gang- though this was a success on his part, he lost many griffons in the raid- and worse, attracted the police. While him and his griffons fled the scene before police could arrive, our forces tracked him down to one of the few labs left in the countryside nearby the city, charging in with guns drawn prepared to finally take down the larger than life griffon- only to find him dead on the floor from a gunshot sustained in the raid. With his death his already weakening empire has come to an end, and our police can take care of the few straggling, weak gangs."

tradefed.138.d:0 "With the final victory over the oligarchs and criminals who had attempted to take control of our city, the people of Skyfall can rest easy. The city is once again in the care of the chancellor, who now wishes to finally accomplish her plans- to give power to the citizens of Skyfall, and to share the wealth of the capitalists to the common folk."
tradefed.138.a:0 "Long live Skyfall!"

tradefed.139.t:0 "Spring Cleaning"
tradefed.139.d:0 "The trade council had finally been destroyed. An institution in place since Guichard's rise to power, it represented the influence of business on government, a power which had been around since Skyfall's time in the empire. With its destruction came the final message that Skyfall's capitalists had been tamed- they no longer were the masters of the people of Skyfall."
tradefed.139.a:0 "And thus it ends."

tradefed.140.t:0 "New Voting Laws"
tradefed.140.d:0 "The people of Skyfall have long yearned for democracy, or, atleast, Genevieve believes so- but even if they did not yearn in the past, the rejoice surrounding its creation could not be imaginary. With voting laws in place and the government becoming more democratic, the people of Skyfall have celebrated the new free government, a beacon of freedom on Griffonia."

tradefed.141.t:0 "A Replacement Grover"
tradefed.141.d:0 "For decades now, Guichard has sent a single Idol coin to replace the lost Idol of Boreas to the Imperial Palace each year on the anniversary of the event. Now, the butt of the joke has died but Guichard, in his twisted sense of humor, thought of a new joke. They had Grover coins. And the now orphan Grover VI had just lost his father Grover. Could the joke be updated? Could he send a Grover coin to the child emperor to replace the Grover he had just lost?\n\nIt would be so immensely inconsiderate and cruel... All just for the sake of a pun..."
tradefed.141.a:0 "It would make me feel quite giddy..."

tradefed.142.t:0 "A New "Gift" From Skyfall"
tradefed.142.d:0 "A new gift has been sent from Skyfall: a single coin in a letter. The officials were puzzled as Chancellor Guichard would only ever sent one letter each year like clockwork and this was a second one? Intrigued by the anomaly, the foreign affairs ministry opened the letter and reviewed it. And they could only balked at the horror. The chancellor of Skyfall had just sent them a silver Grover coin. The letter was addressed to the young emperor and snarkily offered him a parody of condolences. It said that Guichard was offering the Grover coin, hoping that it could replace the emperor's defunct father. The news quickly got out and caused quite a stir at court. However, it was decided that the young emperor was not to know as to protect him in this time of grief. Yet, nogriff would ever forget Guichard's cruel joke."

tradefed.143.t:0 "A Story Of A Coin"
tradefed.143.d:0 "Today, like each year, Guichard sent a single golden coin paid from his personal funds.

tradefed.144.a:0 "Maar damned traitor..."

tradefed.145.t:0 "No More Coins From Skyfall"
tradefed.145.d:0 "Today, unlike previous years, the Imperial foreign affairs ministry didn't receive any letter from Skyfall, at least none containing any coins. It seems that after the demise of chancellor Guichard, the new leaders of Skyfall had little interest in pursuing his peculiar form of humour."
tradefed.145.a:0 "That joke shall not be missed."

tradefed.146.t:0 "A Letter From Skyfall"
tradefed.146.d:0 "A note arrived to Griffenheim today, one penned by chancellor Guichard of Skyfall and addressed to the young Grover personally. The officials were puzzled. The chancellor was known for his lack of diplomacy towards the Empire and especially his petty cruelty towards the Imperial dynasty. And so, the letter was opened and reviewed by the officials under order from the regency to make sure it wouldn't hurt the young Emperor. The panel decided that it was safe for him to read.\n\nGrover VI's personal tutor was tasked to bring him the letter and read it to him. The young emperor acquiesced without hesitation, knowing little at his age of the old chancellor's deeds. Guichard, through his letter, offered the fledgling his condolences and went to describe what he did against his father and why. The tone was apologetic, if a bit self-serving, and gentle. Finally, the old griff apologized for all his deeds and told Grover that he hoped that maybe someday there could be a detente between Skyfall and the Empire and that maybe, just maybe, the young Emperor could live through less brutal times. The young Grover didn't quite understand the word detente but his eyes were watery by the end of the letter. The tutor asked him if he wanted to write an answer. Grover responded to simply write back thank you.\n\nThe next week, the foreign affairs ministry received news that Guichard was sending donations to Imperial charities in the name of the late Emperor."
tradefed.146.d_gv:0 "It was late at night when Grover was brought a letter. He was tired but he was told it was important. It had come from Skyfall, apparently personally penned by Ghislain Guichard himself. The emperor was surprised. Usually, the chancellor would only write to him in january for his annual Idol coin joke. He felt the letter for a moment. No coin in it. Intrigued, he opened it and began to read it. The tone was apologetic and Guichard began to explain to him what he did since the secession and why he did it. The emperor sighed. He knew all this and was waiting for a punchline. However, none arrived. It was all very obnoxious but he could see the chancellor's point. And then, he read those final words. Guichard was apologizing. And no joke followed. Only a hope for a detente and his signature.\n\nGrover took a long breath and looked at the window. For a moment, he didn't really quite know how he felt about it all. Tired as he was by the incessant wars and conflicts, he felt touched by the apology. Of course, it couldn't erase all the wrongs but he believed Guichard's letter to be genuine. Perhaps something could be done? Perhaps a detente could finally happen between the Empire and Skyfall?\n\nBut he was too tired to write a response as of this moment. And so, he simply put down the letter on his table and went to bed."

In exchange for their lives and the lax enforcement of naval law, the pirates would observe a ban on any dealings with Haukland and pirates or smugglers affiliated to us.\n\nNow, with Guichard's death and his niece's election, the old truce is over and Skyfall's pirates are making a show of force. As part of it, they have started to do business with us and some are even relocating in Haukland, bolstering our forces."

tradefed.148.d:0 "During the revolution, a key target was Skyfall General Hospital where the criminal Ghislain Guichard had been hospitalized. Our comrades could only reach the old chancellor with great difficulty as the boreasist militias were also trying to get to him.\n\nAfter an hour of fighting, our comrades prevailed and stormed the building, but Guichard was nowhere to be found. Some vacuous mercenaries had apparently taken him, probably hoping for a handsome reward from either us or him. But the revolution always finds a way to prevail. As they were trying to board a ship, dockers sympathetic to our cause spotted them and stopped them. Guichard was arrested while the mercenaries either died in the fight or fled.\n\nSadly for us all, Ghislain Guichard has died in custody. It is unknown if it was due to poor treatment or his poor health and old age but it's no matter. We won't ever get to have him face trial for his crimes."

It was however easier said than done as his pet mercenaries were guarding him. That is until they finally fled when it dawned on them that you do not get payment for dying. Some of our partisans made sure to teach them a harder lesson than that one.\n\nUnfortunately for us, the unholy syndicalists had the same idea and we had to fight them off to gain control of Skyfall General Hospital. The fight spiraled out of control and combat in the hospital lobby caused a fire. Without any firefighters able to respond, our partisans could only watch as the building began to burn down.\n\nThe syndicalists did scatter after failing to win their target. But then, our partisans began to pray and chant around the burning building, understanding that maybe this is how Boreas wanted Guichard to face justice. Burning in a bonfire fit for the extent of his crimes. A bonfire of iron."

Skyfall overcame the difficulties, trained new specialists and is now ready to provide them for the formation of others on the true path of the Revolution.

TRD_tip_the_police_desc:0 "Skyfall's police under Guichard has been a very well-run institution, albeit one that stayed clear of activities linked to oligarchs. With some 'incentive', we can encourage to ignore those old rules and target our rivals' less than legal operations. That's what they mean by tipping the police, right?"
TRD_hire_whistleblowers:0 "'Acquire' Bank Records"
TRD_hire_whistleblowers_desc:0 "Von Hochsklaue's financial empire gives him power and leverage in Skyfall and beyond. However, should some of his records leak to the press thanks to let's say, a well-funded whistleblower, his power would be significantly affected. After all, if you can't trust your banker to keep your secrets, who can you trust?"
TRD_sabotage:0 "Bribe the Smugglers"
TRD_sabotage_desc:0 "Despite what Guichard used to claim, the port of Skyfall is home to a wide array of smugglers and pirates, many of them with ties to two of our rivals: Bechard and Whitefeather. The smugglers usually not being the loyal or honest type, we can bribe them to point us to strategic ships and shipments of interest to us. What we plan to do with them is not their concern."
TRD_intimidate_workers:0 "Intimidate the Workers"
TRD_intimidate_workers_desc:0 "Kessler's factories' main vulnerability are their workers. While trying to incite them to go on a strike could easily spiral out of control, we can temporarily encourage them to stay in their beautiful homes with their wonderful families. After all, who knows what could happen?"
TRD_steal_from_banks:0 "Steal From the Banks"
TRD_steal_from_banks_desc:0 "Money is the fuel of Skyfallian's politics. While our operations are deeply profitable, they don't provide us with the same level of leverage given by legal and full bank accounts. Let's even the playing field and get paid while doing so!"
TRD_drug_bust:0 "Drug 'Bust'"
TRD_drug_bust_desc:0 "Walter Whitefeather's fortune has largely been built on the drug trade, especially opium. And most of his precious supply comes from a limited number of laboratories. By targetting them, we can cut off the head of his empire. Well, for a time at least."
TRD_felina:0 "Felina"
TRD_felina_desc:0 "One of the cornerstones of Bechard's empire is the Daremaar's crew and their main contact in Skyfall: Little Busta. By approaching him, we might be able to convince him to stop supporting the mercenary king in his bid for chancellorship and cause the Aquileian some headaches at the same time. Two birds with one stone!"
TRD_embezzle_funds:0 "Embezzle Funds"
TRD_embezzle_funds_desc:0 "In Skyfall, nothing can happen in politics without money and the more you have, the better. Let's put our moneygriff on the case. They'll find funds, one way or the other."
TRD_gather_support:0 "Gather Support"
TRD_gather_support_desc:0 "Not every move in a power struggle can be a dirty trick or a show of force. Sometime, you just need to visit those who can influence the vote and convince them the old fashion way. And no, this is not a euphemism for once."
TRD_war_propaganda:0 "Encourage Patriotism"
TRD_war_propaganda_desc:0 "With some funding for well-organized propaganda campaign, we can promote the ideals of our nation to the masses and instill in them a sense of duty towards Skyfall."
TRD_spread_pamphlets:0 "Spread Pamphlets"
TRD_spread_pamphlets_desc:0 "Skyfall has many enemies! Who? It depends! But we'll make sure to spread awareness to who exactly it is at this precise moment so that our people may know who to hate. We'll just need to invest some funds to make the wonders of mass media produce their magic."
TRD_recruitment_drive:0 "Recruitment Drive"
TRD_recruitment_drive_desc:0 "Skyfall needs you! It's a simple message but one that is not that easy to successfully convey. With proper funding, we can inspire many more griffons to serve in our ranks!"
TRD_trade_with_skyfall:0 "Trade With Skyfall"
TRD_trade_with_skyfall_desc:0 "Skyfall, despite its size, is an economic juggernaut. Through some investments and establishing lobbying operations there, we can reap many economic benefits. However, it won't come cheap and Skyfall may not welcome our attempts at increasing trade relations with them."
TRD_stop_trading_with_skyfall:0 "Stop Trading With Skyfall"
TRD_stop_trading_with_skyfall_desc:0 "Trade with Skyfall has benefited us greatly but should the situation change, we can always cut our operations there."
TRD_invite_migrats:0 "Entice Migrants"
TRD_invite_migrats_desc:0 "Our country is a small one and to stand shoulder to shoulder with the great powers of the world, we need more griffonpower and a larger workforce. The world is a troubled places and many creatures around it have little opportunities in their native countries. It would only take a small investment to begin a migration campaign and help creatures moving in and settle."
TRD_bread_and_circuses:0 "Bread And Circuses"
TRD_bread_and_circuses_desc:0 "There is no such a thing as a free lunch. Or a free show for that matter. But we can help the population believe there is. No better way to create goodwill."
TRD_integrate_FEZ:0 "Integrate Fezera"
TRD_integrate_FEZ_desc:0 "For decades, Fezera has been a festering corpse of a once mildly successful city. Its mob - the infamous penose - and the smugglers caused Skyfall all kinds of headaches. Now it's over but it will still take resources to pacify the city in the civilian sense and make it conform to our norms."
TRD_integrate_HAU:0 "Integrate Haukland"
TRD_integrate_HAU_desc:0 "It has been hard but we have done it. Hermann Meyer has been stopped and Haukland has finally been tamed. We now control the Crossroad but if we are to benefit from it, we will need to root out the pirates and invest there."
TRD_land_grants:0 "Sell Unprofitable Businesses"
TRD_land_grants_desc:0 "The Skyfall state has stakes in countless business but not all of them are profitable in the short term or at all. We can forfeit the chance of future returns on our investments for immediate cash."
TRD_buy_factory:0 "Buy Industrial Machinery"
TRD_buy_factory_desc:0 "Starting a factory is always a difficult enterprise. We can help fledgling industries to take off by buying modern machinery from them."
TRD_buy_arms_factory:0 "Buyout Local Gunsmiths"
TRD_buy_arms_factory_desc:0 "There is no shortage of griffons trying their claws at the gun industry. We can nationalize some of them to bolster our military production."
TRD_foreign_technicians:0 "Invite Foreign Industrial Experts"
TRD_foreign_technicians_desc:0 "The world is full of innovators, proudly serving their country. With just a little funding, we can convince them to come serve ours instead. There may be less pride in it but with what we pay them, they'll be able to buy whatever they need to replace it."
TRD_changeling_advisors:0 "Hire Changeling Advisors"
TRD_changeling_advisors_desc:0 "The Changelings are a warlike people and the Empire has demonstrated that they are willing to share their expertise right here in Griffonia. We can invite them to teach our troops some of their underhanded tactics."
TRD_severnya_advisors:0 "Invite Severyanan Exiles"
TRD_severnya_advisors_desc:0 "When the communists overthrew the rightful rulers of Severyana, many of the nobles and soldiers serving it were forced into exile. While it is indeed a tragedy, it also means that they are now both free to hire and less expensive. Let us invite them."
TRD_equestria_advisors:0 "Hire Former Equestrian Officers"
TRD_equestria_advisors_desc:0 "Equestria may be a world superpower but the magic of friendship doesn't pay. We do and with that much money, you'll find more friends anyway. Let us invite some former Equestrian military staff to come and teach us how they reconcile friendship and killing creatures anyway."
TRD_aquileian_advisors:0 "Employ the Aquileians"
TRD_aquileian_advisors_desc:0 "The Aquileian Revolution and subsequent counter revolution has been a gruesome and bloody affair. Ever since, it has been a breeding ground for disenfranchised military officers and soldiers as well as political exiles. Many of them are looking for work and would be eager to serve us."
TRD_buy_light_tanks:0 "Acquire Tanks"

TRD_conquer_FEZ_desc:0 "Grifftonia and Skyfall are the greatest cities on the western shore of Griffonia but there was once a third imperial free city. It's time to crush Fezera's foolish dreams of independence and reclaim this city for our state."
TRD_conquer_HAU:0 "Expanding Our Horizons"
TRD_conquer_HAU_desc:0 "We are the commercial gate of the continent but for decades now, Hermann Meyer's fools have plaid bandits right on our doorsteps. It's time to teach the warlord that we are done being trifled with. No quarters! No mercy!"

blizz_blizz_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 18th of February 979 in Pridea\n\n§YRank§!:Capitaine-Général\n\n§YBiography§!: A privileged mare of unmatched sophistication, Arclight de Liny was born in a noble family in Aquila's pony district. Her doting parents encouraged her interest in the art of war, particularly the military application of magic, but her studies were halted by the outbreak of the 980 ALB Aquileian Revolution. Her family's monarchist loyalties meant they were no longer safe in their home, and they fled over the seas to Equestria.\n\nLife in Equestria was good for Arclight, but also unimaginably boring and she wished to leave. That is when she heard the tales of the mercenary band called the Carnaval Magique, lead by one exile named Tartuffe. They were an elite company of mages known for their dazzling spells and willingness to fight for the highest bidder.\n\nIn 1005, Tartuffe died in a brawl and Arclight took over the company which she now leads with appropriate dazzle and Aquileian style. Arclight's signature képi ensures she stands out wherever the road leads. And for now, that road lead to Skyfall.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

Her father was a strict martinet who only loved two things in his life, duty and his wife, and he eagerly expected a son to which he would teach everything a true Nimbusian soldier should follow. Instead, he was left with a broken heart and a daughter he never wanted.\n\nThus, Cloud Jet had no choice but to conform to her father's unrealistic high standards, attempting to fulfill the Sisyhoofian goal of earning his approval and love, but few things elicited a positive response, of which neither were her perfect scores in the Trials of the Agoge or her exemplary service in the Nimbusian hoplites. Cloud Jet became the ideal of a Nimbusian pony, yet she did not feel any satisfaction with her successes.\n\nThe winds of change under her wings came when Cloud Jet was given a prestigious task of training troops for their Riverland allies, far from Nimbusi and her father's iron grip. Her mental prison cracked in the influence of newfound freedom, and it did not take long for her to desert, taking in ostracised Nimbusians and like-minded rebels under the banner of Oi Myrioi - a mercenary group consisting exclusively of battle hardened pegasi willing to sell their services to the highest bidder and for now, this bidder is Skyfall.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

Young Ghislain did well in school, particularly in regards to mathematics he particularly loved. Being sixth in line, nogriff believed that he would gain much of an inheritance and so some pushed him to join the imperial army as many in his situation do. But this was not to be Ghislain's fate. When he was twenty-four, and just out of studying at Romau university, he asked his father's permission to take over the running of an unprofitable cloth mill that the family-owned in the countryside, and had planned to shut down. His father instead loaned his son the money to buy the factory from him and made him pay off the debt. Ghislain threw himself into his work and, within a year, he had paid back his father's loan. Soon enough, he was buying up smaller factories in the countryside and consolidating his financial power. One by one he even bought out his brothers, showing a complete disregard for such weak concepts as "family", preferring to indulge in the pursuit of money instead.\n\nWhile the whole of Skyfall knew Guichard the businessgriff, they were about to meet a side to him that might have been even scarier. For in 977, Guichard was elected as mayor of the Free City of Skyfall. Austere, he immediately began to roll back privileges for many Imperial nobles and the military, causing Griffenheim more than once to threaten to revoke Skyfall's imperial charter. But everything changed in 978. When Kemerskai launched his coup in Griffenheim, none of the Skyfallian elite was truly on his side but faced with popular uprisings in the city, Guichard decided on a daring plan. Contacting the local republicans in Skyfall he expressed sympathies for their cause and told them how he could assist in taking control of the Imperial fleet. After the republicans had fought for it, Guichard sent in a group of mercenaries and slaughtered them all. He went on to declare Skyfall's full independence.\n\nFew believed that the city could survive on its own but with guile and Guichard's iron claw, the city thrived while their neighbours struggled.\n\nAt 93 years old, Guichard still rules but he can't be immortal...

It was said he danced with the lightning without fear.\n\nWhen he was eighteen years old, Nightmare Moon returned from her exile. The return of the Princess of the Night gave Perkunas hope about the distrust of thestrals coming to an end. However, this did not come to pass, even after Nightmare Moon was reformed into Princess Luna. Little was done to improve the situation of the bat ponies. This unhappiness turned to anger when Perkunas was turned down from entering the military despite his education. Therefore Perkunas decided to leave Equestria and join a mercenary company.\n\nSince then, Perkunas has gained a reputation as a competent, if indecisive commander. His claim to fame is inducing thunderstorms with pegasi, using the lightning to strike targets. While the thunderbolts soften the enemy, he and his unit fly with the storm.

So, when it came to choosing how to serve his country, the choice wasn't a difficult one. He joined the navy. Because he didn't come from a naval family and was looked down upon due to his rich upbringing, Janus decided to fully commit himself to his work, and began reading all kinds of books on naval history, technology, and tactics, everything to prove that he could contribute something. His upper class background did show in his behavior though, which was always polite and respectful.

While in no way his heiress, she was ostracised by many of her friends from loyalist families and isolated herself.\n\nIn 985, she stopped her studies out of a desire to become a priestess of Eyr. A year later, her parents relented and she began her initiation into the clergy.

His first models saw limited success outside of the nobility, professional racers and wealthy merchants class.\n\n978 was a turning point for Kessler's business. Unable to access the Griffonian market, he was facing bankruptcy but crisis allowed him to reveal his business savvy. The Kessler model G which would go on to be nicknamed either the Guichard in Skyfall or the Grover elsewhere was a different beast entirely. Reliable, sturdy and most importantly affordable, it became a symbol of the success of the newly independent Skyfall and Kessler was celebrated by his compatriot.\n\nOver time, Kessler grew distant of his benefactor Guichard and his policies. His business plans were hitting an obstacle: most workers were unable to buy his cars and trucks, even the most affordable and there was only so much cost-cutting he could do from factory efficiency.

Taking to a temple at a young age- often visiting the local temple of Boreas with his mother- he never wavered in his belief. As he matured, he found himself taking a growing interest in theology and law- as well as in media and oration.

His father owned a small dockyard in the city's port and was involved in the construction, repair, and refurbishment of ships; as well as having money invested in both trade and fishing. His mother was a commoner from the countryside who moved to the city to marry rich and live high, but ended up finding a true loving partner instead.\n\nClotbeak's father was a well known philanthropist in Skyfall for years before and after the birth of his son and cared immensely for the workers under his care. But the entire family's life was turned upside down when the revolution came to the continent. The revolutionary forces in the nation forced Clotbeak's father to flee to the shores of Nova Griffonia while the rest of the family hid in a small house that had been inherited from his mother's family. As war wracked the town, the De Altesburg family became famous in their small town for shielding Griffons of all manners from violence, including an Imperial commander who they even convinced to peacefully surrender to the Republicans, instead of sentencing his troops to certain death.\n\nThis was the world Clotbeak De Altesburg grew up in.

Born on the cusp of complete industrialization his father served as a banker working for one of the city's emerging capitalist magnates. His father considered himself an intellectual and always kept the house stocked with books of all types, of which Adalbert was a voracious reader. One day he began to read a specific book by a pony named Caramel Marks who advocated for the worker's revolution and liberation from the capitalism. The rest of the Growder family considered this a phase and paid little heed to the amounts of socialist literature flowing into Adalbert's room. When he was twenty years old, Growder decided he would make his breakout into the socialist world, attending a rally to call for the freedom of another prominent socialist of the time, with whom he would later butt heads, Hendrik Rosebeak. Growder had honed his skills as an orator as much as he could over the years and stood upon a crate of industrial parts and began to deliver a fiery speech against the oppressive capitalist system and spouted his own modifications of Marksian ideas to the griffons who had gathered that day. As his speech gathered in intensity he began to rile the crowd to a fever pitch and at its climax, declared the beginning of the Skyfall revolution. Following this, he was quickly arrested by the police and thrown in a cell. Little did he know, but this would be a blessing in disguise. For the next year, he began work on a combination biography and treatise on his ideas which he would title "My Life, for and by the Revolution", which quickly became popular amongst the radicals of the city as well as the other republican elements who recognized the power this griffon may have in his writings. But this potential was for naught as the events of 978 unfolded. Growder remained in his cell while his city became soaked in blood, revolutionary blood. The display of violence hardened Growder even further to his radical ideas.\n\nAfter his release Growder would stay on the sidelines of revolutionary politics for a while, only emerging when he believed revolution was once more inevitable in Skyfall.

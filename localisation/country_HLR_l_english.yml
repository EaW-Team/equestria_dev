#### intro
arcturian.1.t:0 "A History of the Arcturian Order\nThe Wardens of the North"
arcturian.1.d:0 "The North, it is  cold, dark, and sparsely populated. Upon which lies the Arcturian Order, and ancient holy order founded around the faith and ideals of 12 churches dedicated to the sanctity of The Holy Light.\n\nA Thousand years ago, on the long night, necromancers came pouring from the east. Large armies of undead cadavers in tow, they nearly overwhelmed the the lands now known as the Arcturian Order. Local church militant were the only ones capable of doing anything to stem the tide and push them back.\n\nThe century that followed saw the Arcturian Order being formed by Desmond the Fell-Claw, Holy Father of the Sun Goddess. The Arcturian Order was created for the sole purpose of protecting the living from the foul denizens from the east.\n\nEver since that fateful day nine hundred years ago, they have done their job.\n\nRecent years have written a different story however, as something is amiss in the Dread Peninsula. Border raids have increased in frequency and unicorns in the Order have felt dark energies accumulate beyond the borders. The twelve churches believe themselves ready to weather the storm.\n\nThe question is though, are we really ready for this?"
arcturian.1.a:0 "To answer that, we must look to the East"

### succession
arcturian.2.t:0 "The Mantle of Headmaster\nThe Future of the Arcturian Order"
arcturian.2.d:0 "The senate is in chaos, not one person can make heads or feathers of the situation. Headmaster Torygg is dead, murdered at the hooves of a changeling from an unknown hive. The Arcturian Order mourns the loss of Torygg, he was seen an upstanding and benevolent leader, his actions always adhering to a sound moral code.\n\nThe senate must choose a new Headmaster. A group within the senate has been advocating for one William Steel Beak, whilst a group of traditionalists within the senate have shown interest in Østwald Vind.\n\nWilliam Steel Beak was Torygg's first choice, as he had all the values and characteristics that Torygg saw as what the Arcturian Order needed. William is devoted to the common citizen and the well-being of the inhabitants, he understands the plight of the common Arcturian and is doing his best to answer their pleas. He even believes that anyone has the right to redemption, even the most tainted of hearts have that right in his eyes.\n\nØstwald Vind is an Arcturian traditionalist and follows his faith by the very script they are written in, he gives no room for interpretation. The Arcturian order is a tool against the undead hordes to the east, a bastion against the dead and nothing more. He loves the Order as much as the next griffon does, but through deliberation and hard work, he will see through to the Order's plans. Østwald Vind believes that once you tread down the dark path, the only redeption you will find is that of the bladed edge of a sword.\n\nBoth men love the Order, both men will serve to their fullest, but both men have different views on what is right and what is neccecary. The senate will need deliberate over this information."
arcturian.2.a:0 "Both candidates are promising, but a choice must be made"

### economy
arcturian.3.t:0 "The Economy is Restored\nAll Eyes now look to the East"
arcturian.3.d:0 "After the assassination of Torygg, the economy fell apart. Uncertainty and fear had swept the nation, consuming all confidence among the citizenry. Smiths left their iron. Weavers left their looms and wardens left their posts at prisons. All progress towards modernization was halted as the government descended into chaos. \n\nThe situation is untenable, especially with the Dreaded Necromancers of Magehold knocking on our walls across the Holy Line. New policies or not, the new government must get the people working again.\n\n[HLR.GetLeader]'s next actions must be swift so that we may now focus our energies east. The time is nigh, and as the clock strikes eleven, we know the time of battle draws near. There is no longer room for Error."
arcturian.3.a:0 "Now we must focus on the real issue"

### Dread Attack
arcturian.4.t:0 "The Dread League Attacks!\nThe Arcturian Order Besieged!"
arcturian.4.d:0 "Decades of foreboding dread and years of preparation have gone into readying ourselves against this event! We received our news when the horns of war sounded at the eastern walls and massive hordes of skeletons heralded the first wave. It was beaten back, but [DED.GetLeader] is persistent and will not give up on her crusade against us or life itself.\n\nThe War Council has been called into session to deliberate over our options regarding the eastern menace which is the Dread League. Our options are limited, as is our time to consider them."
arcturian.4.a:0 "We knew this day would come\nWe must act quickly"

### Rosa Trial
arcturian.5.t:0 "The Queen's Trial\nThe Fate of Rosa Maledicta"
arcturian.5.d:0 "The War is over and Magehold is no more. Rosa Maledicta has been captured and awaits her trial. Tremendous effort is what lead us to this conclusion, and at great costs. The Dread Queen herself lies chained to the ground in the courtroom, her horn fitted with the strongest neutralizers available to the [HLR.GetName].\n\nOne side of the court supports her redemption, saying that Rosa Maledicta will be a great asset if she is redeemed. They can be heard discussing the terms of her reformation, some of the tasks sound rigorous, and rightfully so. The former Dread League Queen will need to work for her redemption, as restitution for all the suffering she has caused.\n\nAt the end of this 'redemption plan', she will have earned the right to live as a free mare. The right to determine her own place among those she would have previously cast into ruin, the Rosa Maledicta will be able to live amongst the living.\n\nThe other side of the court desires only one thing, the death of Rosa Maledicta. It is the only solution in their eyes for all the crimes she has committed against the living. They would not settle for any other answer.\n\nA choice must be made, does she get to live? Or is her salvation to be found on the bladed edge of the executioners axe?\n\nWhat choice will [HLR.GetLeader] make?"
arcturian.5.a:0 "Her crimes are too much.\nShe will only find justice in execution."
arcturian.5.b:0 "No one is beyond redemption, not even the former queen of the Dread League"

### rose lives on
arcturian.6.t:0 "The Queen of the Dread League Reformed!\nThe Turning of a New Leaf"
arcturian.6.d:0 "Rosa Maledicta has proven her worth and reformed her ways, gone is the evil mad-mare who hates all life. What lies before us is a mare who worked for her freedom, who devoted her very soul to understanding friendship when we offered it to her.\n\nThe road was long an arduous, her worldview vastly different from that which any other pony would hold. Although the taint of dark magic will forever permeate her unnatural and twisted body, her mind now sings for all that is good in the world.

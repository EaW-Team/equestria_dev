HLR_infrastrucure:0 "The Railroad"

HLR_tank_modernization:0 "The New Spear Tip"
HLR_tank_modernization_desc:0 "The philosophy of military councils around the globe are split on the role of tanks. Should they be light vehicles used for rapid breakthroughs and encirclements?

HLR_infantry_modern_desc:0 "Our swords have served us for generations, and they will continue to do so for generations to come.

HLR_motorized_desc:0 "Even our elite knights could scarcely travel more than fifty kilometers in a single day. However, with the advent of the truck, there is great hope that this fifty-kilometer limit will be shattered, ushering in a new era of warfare."

HLR_artillery:0 "A New Bombard"
HLR_artillery_desc:0 "Artillery has proven to be a devastating weapon of war and has been used to great effect by the industrial nations of the planet. However, before we can create a proper artillery doctrine, we must first upgrade our existing cannons into something more fitting for modern conflicts.\n\nFor starters, we should adopt shells. They are apparently all the rage."

HLR_land_doctrine:0 "New Knightly Doctrines"
HLR_land_doctrine_desc:0 "In the last war we used shield walls, archery volleys, and musket barrages.\n\nObviously, these tactics need to be revised before we find ourselves at war again."

HLR_scientific_breakthrough:0 "Establish the Torygg Military Academy"
HLR_scientific_breakthrough_desc:0 "Our kingdom's research base is incredibly small, depressing what little scientific advancement we can muster. In order to address this, the senate has called for the establishment of a military academy which will both develop doctrine while supply research space to weapons and equipment development."

HLR_mech:0 "Combined Claws"
HLR_mech_desc:0 "It is hoped that with the development of half-tracks, we can finally create a proper armoured doctrine and adopt the advantages of Changeling war doctrine."

HLR_scientific_advancements:0 "A New General Staff"
HLR_scientific_advancements_desc:0 "Our investment into the Torygg Military Academy is already paying dividends, producing the seeds of a new general staff.\n\nOur senate is incredibly impressed by this accomplishment and would like to provide further funding to expand the Academy and its research facilities."

###PI Political - Harmony (AKA the one with the really hot gryphon.)
HLR_Harmony:0 "The Holy Constitution"
HLR_Harmony_desc:0 "It was through change and adaptation that we overcame our millennium of conflict. So, it is only fitting that we continue to cement the values of harmony by drafting a constitution supporting the freedoms of speech, assembly, politics, and expression. Though, unlike other harmony-leaning kingdoms, we should be conveniently silent on the freedom of worship."

HLR_Friend_neighbors:0 "Our Place in the World"
HLR_Friend_neighbors_desc:0 "For generations we were left detached from the world at world. This left us completely isolated when we needed assistant in our struggle for survival.\n\nNow that we can stand firmly on our own four legs, it is time to return to the international community."

HLR_our_faction:0 "The Holy League"
HLR_our_faction_desc:0 "Centuries ago, our Holy Order was under siege, driving us to our most desperate hour. However, when things looked bleakest an army crested the horizon and slammed into the Dread League's rear, shattering them.\n\nIt has been a long time since this victory, but the memory of the Holy League is still fresh in our minds."

HLR_sunstriker_peace:0 "Invitation to Sunstriker"
HLR_sunstriker_peace_desc:0 "While the lands held by the Sunstriker Clan are modest in terms of population and industry, they hold several potential benefits. The first is the rich mineral and gem deposits in the north, which could fuel our industry in the event of blockade. The second, is the heavily mountainous terrain which, if brought in line with out faction, will be very helpful in defending against southern aggression."

HLR_watertowns_peace:0 "Invitation to the Council"
HLR_watertowns_peace_desc:0 "To our south lays the Watertowns, a confederation of small townships aligned under the banner of communism. While we have no love for this philosophy, it does leave Watertown in a precarious situation, wedged between unfriendly regimes. If we exploit this weakness we can pressure them into our alliance while also shoring up our south-eastern flank."

HLR_northerntribes_peace:0 "Invitation to Fiana"
HLR_northerntribes_peace_desc:0 "To our west lies the Northern Tribes, a kingdom ruled by [NTR.GetLeader]. An alliance with them would be highly attractive. Their capital, Everfrost, is the second largest city in the north, offering a wealth of industry. Their terrain is dense with forests and hills, offering a very defensible situation. Lastly, their monarch is aligned with harmonic values, meaning they are a natural ally."

HLR_convert_maar_supporters:0 "The Second Holy League"
HLR_convert_maar_supporters_desc:0 "Now that our alliances are properly cemented, volunteers from abroad have begun to flood in. This fresh ponypower provides us the means to form a second Holy League in the image of the first.\n\nHowever, the new recruits also come from lands with a wide range of radically different ideologies, which is proving to be a problem."

###PI Political - Non-Aligned (Aka the one with the less hot gryphon)
HLR_Nonallign:0 "Re-Affirming Our Beliefs"
HLR_Nonallign_desc:0 "It may have taken a millennium but we have finally done it. Our devotion to the holy text has allowed us to finally overcome the Dread League and instil complete control over their accursed peninsula.\n\nFor now, we will celebrate. However, what will the future hold for a military order with no foes to fight?"

HLR_rallying_for_war:0 "Revenge"
HLR_rallying_for_war_desc:0 "In the past, the griffon world stood united in their support of our cause. However, as time crawled on, these kingdoms began to abandon us one by one, until we stood alone.\n\nIt is time to return to our former brothers and teach them the price of treason."

HLR_war_Sunstriker:0 "Mountain Expedition"
HLR_war_Sunstriker_desc:0 "In 561, Erik Sunstriker fell in battle, aiding our knights against the Dread League. His son, also known as Erik, soon ascended to the throne and his reign would mark the end of all future support from his lands to our order.\n\nIt is now time to collect what we're owed."

HLR_war_Watertowns:0 "Ending the Council"
HLR_war_Watertowns_desc:0 "To our southeast lies the Watertowns, a loose collection of townships aligned under the banner of communism. Communism as a philosophy is hostile to our noble nature and would stop at nothing to undermine our order.\n\nWe must strike and snuff out their supposed revolution."

HLR_war_Northern_tribes:0 "Subjugating the Tribes"
HLR_war_Northern_tribes_desc:0 "The Northern Tribes did not exist when our holy mission was first bestowed upon us. However, once the tribes had been unified they stood idle as our knights perished protecting them.\n\nNow that the League is finished, we have every right to occupy Fiana's lands and extract our payment."

HLR_purge_heratics:0 "Purge The Heretics"
HLR_purge_heratics_desc:0 "The lands we've recently conquered hold a considerable population of Maar supporters, especially within the former lands of the Sunstriker Clan. This religion is an upfront to our order and can not be allowed to exist. For our own good, we must purge those who worship this false idol."

HLR_finish_north:0 "The Great Northern War"
HLR_finish_north_desc:0 "While the Sunstrikers, Northern Tribes, and Watertowns all betrayed us, they were not alone in this.\n\nIt is now time to make a move against the largest of these traitors and bring them under our direct control. That way we can assure that there resources are properly managed."

HLR_gains_cores:0 "A Holy Empire"
HLR_gains_cores_desc:0 "The lands we rule are recently conquered and their citizens show little loyalty to our authority. To address this, our senate wishes to federate the lands into a series of petty kingdoms. On paper, this sounds similar to what has ailed the Griffonian Empire for centuries. However, our petty kingdoms will act more lie governorships with kings appointed by the Emperor rather than some hereditary system."

HLR_Build_army:0 "An Imperial Army"
HLR_Build_army_desc:0 "Our newly federated kingdoms find it easier to recruit from the local populace, due to the perception that these 'kingdom' armies are somehow autonomous of the Holy Imperial Army. However, this couldn't be farther from the truth. These recruits may believe they are serving a local lord, but in reality, they pledge allegiance to the Emperor and the Emperor alone."

###PI Naval Tree (Snoreeeeee)
HLR_dock_yards:0 "The Royal Shipyard"
HLR_dock_yards_desc:0 "For centuries our order has ignored the potential benefits of a navy. However, with our victory we have now discovered how vulnerable we are to blockades and naval invasions.\n\nTo address this, our senate has called for the establishment of a Royal Shipyard in Magehold."

HLR_battleship:0 "Hofschroer Doctrine"
HLR_battleship_desc:0 "Due to the limited scope of our naval infrastructure we need to focus our build up efforts either around battleships or carriers.\n\nMinister of Navy Agnis Hofschroer, favours the construction of battleships, believing that carrier plans cannot hold up under the harsh northern weather."

HLR_carrier_focus:0 "Enterprise Doctrine"
HLR_carrier_focus_desc:0 "Due to the limited scope of our naval infrastructure we need to focus our build up efforts either around battleships or carriers.\n\nAdmiral Lofty Enterprise, favours the construction of carriers, pointing towards their revolutionary role within the Equestrian Navy as a chief example of their benefits."

HLR_dock_yards2:0 "Expansion of the Royal Shipyard"
HLR_dock_yards2_desc:0 "If we wish to have a navy which can rival our foes, then we must first construct the proper infrastructure to support it. In order to achieve this, our senate has released a sizeable chunk of emergency funding to help expand the existing naval facilities in Magehold."

HLR_doctrine_buff:0 "His Majesty's Naval Academy"
HLR_doctrine_buff_desc:0 "We've built the facilities, we've selected a flagship, and now it's time to actually begin developing a combat effective doctrine.\n\nTo achieve this, the senate has called for the immediate establishment of a naval college in Magehold to train new officers and bring together the brightest minds in naval tactics."

###PI Air Tree
HLR_air_training:0 "Rethinking the Wing"
HLR_air_training_desc:0 "We're griffons, and griffons fly. However, the modern world has created machines which fly faster, carry more weapons, and dish our far more damage then any lone griffon could ever hope to muster.\n\nThis revolution in flying may seem jarring at first. However, if we wish to survive in this strange world, then we need to adapt."

HLR_Bomber_effort:0 "Death from Above"
HLR_Bomber_effort_desc:0 "It wasn't so long ago that death was a personal act, committed at the end of our knight's swords. However, bombers are a recent development which allow a small crew to kill from a very impersonal altitude of a few thousand meters.\n\nThis is the horror of modern war."

HLR_fighter_effort:0 "The New Knights"
HLR_fighter_effort_desc:0 "Around our best pilots have risen a certain celebrity status, with people worshipping them like the heroes of folklore. Other kingdoms may call them aces but, to us, they are knights.\n\nAnd while many things change, our commitment to giving our knights the best equipment has stayed true."

HLR_aiports:0 "Air Arcturian"
HLR_aiports_desc:0 "Air Arcturian is a crown corporation established to provide flights between the major settlements of our kingdom. An extension of this mission is to construct, expand, and maintain runways across the land. While this mission is civilian in nature, these runways can be claimed during wartime and used by military craft."

HLR_CAS_effort:0 "Angels from Above"
HLR_CAS_effort_desc:0 "A tank approaches an infantry unit on the plains near Chloeland. These foot soldiers are left helpless against the approaching brute. Yet a quick thinking officer uses his radio to call for help and within five minutes a buzzing can be heard. A moment passes before the angel breaks the fog and unleashes its payload upon our enemy."

HLR_Air_doctrine:0 "Spindle's Flying School"
HLR_Air_doctrine_desc:0 "Our air force has grown greatly in the past few years, both in terms variety and size.\n\nIn order to address this change, our military has asked Air Marshall Ewe Spindle to establish a flight academy in Pondwatch, allowing for the training of future pilots and the development of doctrine."

###Windigo Boss Fight
HLR_boss_fight:0 "The Last Battle"
HLR_boss_fight_desc:0 "The danger we face is enormous, so our own efforts must be enormous as well. To defeat the Wendigo menace once and for all, we will need help from outside our own borders. Until we can be reinforced, we must hold out against the Northern Storm."

HLR_emergency_telegram:0 "Emergency Telegrams"
HLR_emergency_telegram_desc:0 "Today we fight not for just one nation, one people, no. Today, we fight for all of Griffonia, and we cannot win this struggle on our own. It's time to call upon our neighbours and ask them for the help we so desperately need."

HLR_emergency_reinforcements:0 "Emergency Reinforcements"
HLR_emergency_reinforcements_desc:0 "We are in urgent need of more soldiers to expand our garrison and hold the tide against the Wendigo menace. All our reserves must be sent to reinforce our army immediately, and an urgent conscription drive must be implemented for us to hold out."

HLR_all_in_this_together:0 "Viribus Unitis!"
HLR_all_in_this_together_desc:0 "We stand stronger and more united now than we ever have before. Now it is time for the last battle, for the ultimate test of our might, courage and discipline. We are all in this together, and with our force united we can finish the fight once and for all."


###Deal with the Devil
HLR_Dealing_With_The_Devil:0 "A Deal with Death Itself"
HLR_Dealing_With_The_Devil_desc:0 "The Dread League is our mortal enemy since time immemorial. It was always going to come down to a holy war between us and them...although there may yet be another option. Across the border, in the League's blighted lands live people...ponies, griffons...perhaps it may yet be possible to pacify the League peacefully."

HLR_more_in_common_than_you_think:0 "Opposites attract?"
HLR_more_in_common_than_you_think_desc:0 "For so long have we been focused on our rivalry with the Dread League, we never bothered to look deeper...in the end, we are not so dissimilar from each other. Especially the League's leader, Rosa Maledicta, is very intriguing in her views and style of leadership. We must seek some sort of accommodation with the League."

HLR_our_dread_soverign:0 "Our Dread Sovereign"
HLR_our_dread_soverign_desc:0 "For two long have we suffered under the corrupt and decadent leadership of the so called Arcturian Order. Her Majesty Rosa Maledicta has so much more to offer us all...it's time for us to swear fealty to our new Dread Sovereign."

HLR_this_is_not_the_way_rosa:0 "A Better Way"
HLR_this_is_not_the_way_rosa_desc:0 "The leader of the Dread League, Rosa Maledicta, is not a ghoul, a skeleton or some other unholy abomination. She is a pony, and ponies are known for their love of friendship and harmony...surely she can be no different? There must be a way to show her a better way..."

HLR_friendship_magic:0 "Friendship is Magic!"
HLR_friendship_magic_desc:0 "Today, we have all learned that friendship truly is magic. The Dread League and its leader, Rosa Maledicta, have agreed to peacefully integrate into the Holy Order proper, giving themselves up for purification. This is truly a momentous occasion, never in a thousand years would anyone have seen this coming."

###### code  :0 ""
##    _desc

### succession
arcturian.2.t:0 "The Mantle of Headmaster\nThe Future of the Arcturian Order"
arcturian.2.d:0 "The senate is in chaos, not one person can make heads or feathers of the situation. Headmaster Torygg is dead, murdered at the hooves of a changeling from an unknown hive. The Arcturian Order mourns the loss of Torygg, he was seen an upstanding and benevolent leader, his actions always adhering to a sound moral code.\n\nThe senate must choose a new Headmaster. A group within the senate has been advocating for one William Steel Beak, whilst a group of traditionalists within the senate have shown interest in Østwald Vind.\n\nWilliam Steel Beak was Torygg's first choice, as he had all the values and characteristics that Torygg saw as what the Arcturian Order needed. William is devoted to the common citizen and the well-being of the inhabitants, he understands the plight of the common Arcturian and is doing his best to answer their pleas. He even believes that anyone has the right to redemption, even the most tainted of hearts have that right in his eyes.\n\nØstwald Vind is an Arcturian traditionalist and follows his faith by the very script they are written in, he gives no room for interpretation. The Arcturian order is a tool against the undead hordes to the east, a bastion against the dead and nothing more. He loves the Order as much as the next griffon does, but through deliberation and hard work, he will see through to the Order's plans. Østwald Vind believes that once you tread down the dark path, the only redemption you will find is that of the bladed edge of a sword.\n\nBoth griffons love the Order, both griffons will serve to their fullest, but they both have different views on what is right and what is necessary. The senate will need deliberate over this information."
arcturian.2.a:0 "Both candidates are promising, but a choice must be made."

### economy
arcturian.3.t:0 "The Economy is Restored\nAll Eyes now look to the East"
arcturian.3.d:0 "After the assassination of Torygg, the economy fell apart. Uncertainty and fear had swept the nation, consuming all confidence among the citizenry. Smiths left their iron. Weavers left their looms and wardens left their posts at prisons. All progress towards modernisation was halted as the government descended into chaos. \n\nThe situation is untenable, especially with the Dreaded Necromancers of Magehold knocking on our walls across the Holy Line. New policies or not, the new government must get the people working again.\n\n[HLR.GetLeader]'s next actions must be swift so that we may now focus our energies east. The time is nigh, and as the clock strikes eleven, we know the time of battle draws near. There is no longer room for Error."
arcturian.3.a:0 "Now we must focus on the real issue."

### Dread Attack
arcturian.4.t:0 "The Dread League Attacks!\nThe Arcturian Order Besieged!"
arcturian.4.d:0 "Decades of foreboding dread and years of preparation have gone into readying ourselves against this event! We received our news when the horns of war sounded at the eastern walls and massive hordes of skeletons heralded the first wave. It was beaten back, but [DED.GetLeader] is persistent and will not give up on her crusade against us or life itself.\n\nThe War Council has been called into session to deliberate over our options regarding the eastern menace which is the Dread League. Our options are limited, as is our time to consider them."
arcturian.4.a:0 "We knew this day would come\nWe must act quickly."

### Rosa Trial

arcturian.7.t:0 "The Queen's Trial\nThe Fate of Rosa Maledicta"
arcturian.7.d:0 "The War is over and Magehold is no more. Rosa Maledicta has been captured and awaits her trial. Tremendous effort is what lead us to this conclusion, and at great costs. The Dread Queen herself lies chained to the ground in the courtroom, her horn fitted with the strongest neutralisers available to the [HLR.GetName].\n\nOne side of the court supports her redemption, saying that Rosa Maledicta will be a great asset if she is redeemed. They can be heard discussing the terms of her reformation, some of the tasks sound rigorous, and rightfully so. The former Dread League Queen will need to work for her redemption, as restitution for all the suffering she has caused.\n\nAt the end of this 'redemption plan', she will have earned the right to live as a free mare. The right to determine her own place among those she would have previously cast into ruin, the Rosa Maledicta will be able to live amongst the living.\n\nThe other side of the court desires only one thing, the death of Rosa Maledicta. It is the only solution in their eyes for all the crimes she has committed against the living. They would not settle for any other answer.\n\nA choice must be made, does she get to live? Or is her salvation to be found on the bladed edge of the executioners axe?\n\nWhat choice will [HLR.GetLeader] make?"
arcturian.7.a:0 "Her crimes are too much.\nShe will only find justice in execution."
arcturian.7.b:0 "No one is beyond redemption, not even the former queen of the Dread League."

### rose lives on
arcturian.6.t:0 "The Queen of the Dread League Reformed!\nThe Turning of a New Leaf"
arcturian.6.d:0 "Rosa Maledicta has proven her worth and reformed her ways, gone is the evil mad-mare who hates all life. What lies before us is a mare who worked for her freedom, who devoted her very soul to understanding friendship when we offered it to her.\n\nThe road was long an arduous, her worldview vastly different from that which any other pony would hold. Although the taint of dark magic will forever permeate her unnatural and twisted body, her mind now sings for all that is good in the world. She may be prone to some of her old habits from time to time, but they do not define her as a pony anymore.\n\nShe has a place within the [HLR.GetName] as a general in our military, where with her newfound appreciation for life, has expressed eagerness to serve us. Strange times are upon us, the Dread League is gone, and the greatest adversary to have ever come from there is now our greatest ally."
arcturian.6.a:0 "As strange as everything may be.\nThe future can only get brighter."

### rosa wedding bells
arcturian.51.t:0 "A Holy Union Between Life and Death\nBells Ring for [HLR.GetLeader] and Rosa Maledicta"
arcturian.51.d:0 "Wedding bells ring throughout the capital, guests have gathered in the centre of the Twelve Temples. All attention in the [HLR.GetName] has converged on two individuals, [HLR.GetLeader] and Rosa Maledicta. Vows were exchanged under the watch of the Twelve, gazing lovingly into the eyes of the other as they did so.\n\nThe time came for them to kiss, and so they did.

Taking every opportunity to terrorize our forces.\n\nThey burn our supplies, waiting until we are too burdened by famine and disease to strike.\n\nThey sabotage our efforts at every single opportunity, in the hope that one day we will collapse. That we will be unable to continue our long battle against their dark forces.\n\nThey are wrong. Whatever vile tricks and underhanded tactics they employ, they will never be able to defeat us.

arcturian.65.d:0 "For generations, the [HLR.GetName] has remained in relative isolation, being too occupied with its traditional role of containing the [DED.GetName] to interfere with events abroad. However, this has resulted in the world moving beyond the order's historic mission and largely leaving it behind.\n\nIn the wake of Headmaster Torygg's dead, debate over the issue of outside contact has been ignited. On one side are the traditionalists, who believe that foreign intervention would be a waste of resources that could otherwise be used against the [DED.GetName]. On the other are the reformers who believe that allies abroad will be necessary for the coming conflict."
arcturian.65.a:0 "We can't stand against the [DED.GetName] alone."
arcturian.65.b:0 "We mustn't lose sight of our historic mission."

arcturian.63.t:0 "Weapons or Wardrobes"
arcturian.63.d:0 "Strict adherence to scripture has left little room for independent economic development within the lands administered by the [HLR.GetName]. This has led to a severely stunted economy which lags behind the world at large.\n\nIn the wake of Headmaster Torygg's death, debate has become heated within the senate about how future economic development should be focused. The traditionalists believe that spare resources should be primarily geared towards expanding the order's armoury. On the other claw the reformers claim that implementing a road-building program and offering official support to our infant textile industry would be better in the long-term."

arcturian.61.d:0 "Our scripture speaks volumes to the duties of our knightly class but largely ignores those of the peasants and merchants in the order's lands. These two groups make up a majority of the population and within recent years have begun to ask for a greater degree of representation within the order.\n\nWith the death of Headmaster Torygg there has has been renewed debate on the status of the non-knight classes. The traditionalists state that only those who provide military service to the realm should have a say in its management. Meanwhile, the reformers believe that the order's inability to adapt is denying them access to a large pool of potential skills."

However, in our current world is it really wise to limit our armed forces to such a small group of knights?\n\nFor generations, this has been the stance taken by the traditionalists, who claim that only the knights have the expertise required to win our seemingly eternal war. The reformer, on the other claw, claim that developments in warfare prove that keeping a citizen's army can be beneficial to the defence of our realm."

Their destruction is laid out in our scripture and open hostility towards them is the only thing that the rival factions in our senate can agree upon.\n\nHowever, what can not be determined is what to do with the citizens of the Dread Peninsula once our armies storm the border. The traditionalists have taken a hardline stance and demand that no quarters be given and that every Necromancer be put to the sword. The reformers on the other claw believe that through religious cleansing, the subjects of the [DED.GetName] can be redeemed and made to see the error of their ways."

It is said to have the power to purify all evil from individuals, even those who seem beyond redemption. However, the weapon was lost early in our order's history and taken beyond our reach, to the spire in Magehold.\n\nAs our war continues to drag on and defeat looks ever present, Headmaster [HLR.GetLeader] has planned a desperate raid in order to rescue this artefact and return it to Tarpian Rock.\n\nThe 100 knights selected for this mission are the best of the best. Veterans who have distinguished themselves repeatedly in the field of battle.\n\nThe task before them is classified as near suicidal, but they are willing to make the sacrifice if it means defeating the Dread League once and for all."

arcturian.67.t:0 "Our Final Victory"
arcturian.67.d:0 "Reports came in at dawn, stating that there was absolute anarchy at the frontline. However, it was not an attack upon our forces but rather a riot amongst the enemy. It would appear that within a matter of minutes their army fragmented into hundreds of petty squabbling factions, each vying violently for control.\n\nOur army was actually caught off guard by this and when they finally organised an attack, they were confronted by little resistance. The Dread League's front collapsed and our army chased them until the sun set and exhaustion set in.\n\nWhen the next day broke, there was nothing. Not even a single ghoul who stood in opposition as our army marched towards Magehold.\n\nAlong the way, they encountered 20 knights and a single prisoner. One of the knights held a battered shield, the Shield of Hope.\n\nAccording to them, they fought violently through Magehold, leading a desperate sally against the spire. They took heavy causalities but managed to breach to structure and press through its ghoul-filled corridors.\n\nEventually, they came upon the relic room and found the weapon in question. This is when they were confronted by Rosa herself. She attempted to smite our knights but they used the shield in self defence, activating its effect upon her.\n\nShe was purified and her link to the Dread League shattered, breaking apart what little unity our foe possessed.\n\nNow, the Dread League is finished and she is our prisoner."

arcturian.71.t:0 "The Shield of Hope"
arcturian.71.d:0 "In the depths of Magehold lies an artifact of tremendous power, a weapon rumoured to have the ability to purge all traces of necromantic or vampiric influence from an individual. Obviously, this weapon does little good against our foes in the Order. However, if it were to fall into the wrong hooves, it could be disastrous for our cause.\n\nSadly, we have no means to properly dispose of this weapon, and as such, we can only safeguard it within our keep. Even worse, there have been rumours that the Arcturian Order is planning a raid against Magehold. We fear that this operation may be in search of this weapon. However, Rosa assures her council, claiming that Magehold's walls are impenetrable, and our armies will sweep away any desperate raids."

These are the remains of the task force sent into the jaws of Magehold.\n\nWhile they seem exhausted, battered, and bruised, their collective spirits are high. The reason for this is a well-worn shield in their possession. It doesn't seem like much. Yet, this is the fabled Shield of Hope.\n\nBy the time they reach the city's central citadel, the streets are clogged in celebration. These heroes have returned with the weapon which promises to turn the tides of this war in our favour. For now, the weapon lies in our care, being studied to try and discover its latent effects. However, word of this daring raid has gone across the front, emboldening the will of our soldiers to carry on their struggle."

Experts are skeptical that such a changeling came from either Grenclyf or the far away Changeling lands, however none of his origins can be ascertained. The assassin has vanished without a trace it seems and without modern crime investigative technology, the Arcturian Order is left baffled. It seems this is a mystery which will not be solved for now. Fingers instead are pointed squarely at Rosa Maledicta's growing cult in the Dread Lands. Yet, investigators feel that something isn't quite right with the case.

After all, the room had been untouched ever since the investigation into his death had concluded. In fact, the maid had told [HLR.GetLeader] that Torygg had left explicit instructions not to clean it, or enter. Upon entry [HLR.GetLeader] is surprised to see maps and books and discarded sheets of ancient parchment. It seems Torygg was a bit of a scholar. Among the many volumes is a single leather bound journal which Torygg seemed to keep as a kind of diary. Its pages are confusing however, referencing some kind of hidden ancient power which has influenced all kinds of dark and unfortunate events. There is even scraps of vague evidence to support the theory. From the Prywhen Civil War, to the ancient conflicts of the three pony tribes, this dark force has been prevalent throughout history. An interesting read, but with such little evidence and stretched half truths, it is hardly a convincing read."

#Torygg's Investigation Events
arcturian.44.t:0 "Influx of New Crime Fighting Technologies"
arcturian.44.d:0 "Since the defeat of the Dread League and rise of the Arcturian Kingdom, we've been able to devote increasing resources into modernising our state. One aspect of our society which has benefited greatly from this is law and order, which has seen a massive influx of new technologies related to criminal investigation.\n\nWith the use of these technologies, there has been a renaissance in crime fighting, with long buried cold cases finally being solved with the use of modern techniques. As our skill with these technologies matures, members of the original investigation into the death of Headmaster Torygg are calling for the case to be reopened. It's hoped that with the application of these modern measures we'll finally be able to shed some light on lingering issues from the initial investigation."
arcturian.44.a:0 "They have the consent of the crown."

arcturian.45.t:0 "A Breakthrough, Then Dead End"
arcturian.45.d:0 "With the case officially reopened, a team of investigators were assembled and given free reign to find leads into the assassination of Headmaster Torygg. The team selected is a combination of veteran investigators, from the original case, and also less experienced recruits, who are hoped to bring in a fresh perspective.\n\nOne segment of the team took a closer look at the rifle, using advanced ballistics to determine that the gun in question used a highly specialised round, known to only be craft in Equestria. While these rounds are not especially rare, very few have been imported into our region of the globe.\n\nAnother segment of the team turned their attention towards investigating the missing evidence from the original case. They employed the services of a very delicate magical sensor which scanned the room. What they discovered were mostly the faint aftereffects of telekinetic magic. This wasn't especially surprising, due to the number of unicorn investigators on staff. However, it did allow us to properly calibrate the equipment.\n\nOnce calibrated, the investigators noted that more evidence was missing from the original case. When they used the device to scan these spots, they detected the presence of an unknown magical hoofprint. However, they were able to determine a few things. First, the spell wasn't equine in origin, second, it was incredibly powerful, and lastly, it was determined that the caster used the spell from a unknown but remote location. It is also worth noting that the investigators reported a persistent drop in temperature upon becoming aware of the spell.\n\nWhile this occurred, a third, and final, segment of our team attempted to track the assassin. For this, they employed a piece of Equestrian technology which is used to uncover and track Changeling infiltrators. Though, little hope was attached to this approach, due to the length of time which has elapsed since the assassination. However, the team was shocked to discover that there were still trace amounts of Changeling magic present within the assassin's den.\n\nThey were able to follow this trail away from the city and into a nearby forest. It was here that the trail finally went dead. In a desperate effort to find more evidence, the magical sensor, used in the evidence locker, was deployed on site. It was able to pick up the same strange magical hoofprint from early, though in a more dispersed and weakened fashion."
arcturian.45.a:0 "How strange, we must keep this investigation active."

arcturian.46.t:0 "Message in a Cave"
arcturian.46.d:0 "Our investigators have been busy scouring the nearby forests in an effort to find any trace of the Changeling assassin. During this search, they stumbled upon a small burrow in the side of a hill. At a glance, the sight was dismissed as being too impractical to investigate. However, our sensors determined that the Changeling's presence was especially strong here.\n\nSo, the site was properly excavated and a bounty of fresh evidence was very literally unearthed.\n\nThe first piece was a series of bullets which shared the same make of those used to kill Headmaster Torygg. These rounds were found within a small cardboard box, bearing the name of the manufacturer back in Equestria. However, slapped over this box was a sticker bearing the address and name of a famous hunting store in New Mareland.\n\nThe second piece was a small pouch of money, with various currencies inside. It's clear that the assassin was not some Dread League convert, but rather a mercenary who sold their skills to the highest bidder. What's even more interesting is that none of the Dread League's gold was present within this purse. This would mean that the assassin hadn't taken any payment upfront, which seems unlikely to our investigators. On top of this, some the currency present looks like an untarnished version of a coinage minted in our lands over six hundred years ago. Not even the most die-hard collectors could find quality this good.\n\nThe final piece was a message discovered within the box of bullets, written on a small segment of parchment and drafted in a rather crude cipher. Once translated, it read:\n\n'Torygg's dead and I'm meeting our employers in a few hours. I don't trust them in the slightest, but we need the bits. If you get here and I'm not around, run. These guys don't strike me as the kind who'd buck around with loose ends.'\n\nAlong with the message, there are a pair of coordinates. While no context for them is provided, they seem to lead to a location within the Dread Peninsula."
arcturian.46.a:0 "What the hell is going on?"

arcturian.68.t:0 "Unexpected Lead"
arcturian.68.d:0 "Since our annexation of Magehold, we've spent many resources on scouring the city's former citadel in an effort to better understand the motives of Rosa and the Dread League. This task has been slow, hindered by the reluctance of our scribes to really delve too deeply into the philosophies of such troubled individuals, in the fear that it'll taint them.\n\nRecently however, two new pieces of text have been discovered which could be of some assistance to our investigators.\n\nThe first is a series of letters between Rosa and her closest associates, which displays great surprise at the news of Torygg's assassination. It's clear that she and her inner circle did not order the operation, nor did they provide it with any material assistance. While this doesn't completely rule out Dread League involvement, it does put into question who was really footing the bill.\n\nThe second, is the diary of an incredibly old lich. In his notes, he describes the discovery of certain magical nodes throughout the Dread Peninsula. These nodes are especially rich in magical energy and are easily taped by users of blood and necromantic branches of magic. Along with his notes, is a fairly detailed map which pinpoints all the nodes known by him.\n\nOne such node just happens to be mere kilometers from the coordinates provided by the assassin's final letter."
arcturian.68.a:0 "We must send our investigators to this site."

arcturian.69.t:0 "The Final Stretch"

arcturian.70.t:0 "End of the Line"
arcturian.70.d:0 "At day break, a single wagon approached one of our fortresses along the former Arcturian-Dread League border.\n\nThe wagon was driven by a half crazed stallion in a state of malnutrition and severe frostbite. He claimed to be Guardsgriff Winter Frost, a member of the investigation into the death of Headmaster Torygg.\n\nHe was admitted to the fortress' hospital, where he proceeded to tell the garrison commander about the events of the investigation since its departure from Tarpian Rock.\n\nAt first, the team steadily progressed through the Dread Peninsula, arriving at their destination without a hitch. What they found was a small hamlet abandoned eons ago. As they entered this settlement, their sensitive magical sensors began to run amok, displaying that the area was rich with a latent magical energy.\n\nAs our team searched the town, they discovered that the interiors of all the structures were perfectly preserved, failing to match their dilapidated exteriors.\n\nThe hamlet's temple provided a trove of written records. This was mostly comprised of records of births, deaths, and marriages, with all dating back to no sooner than 1300 years ago.\n\nAmong these works, there was also a diary belonging to the hamlet's final priest. It told the story of a cult which had taken root in the town and included many of the villagers. At first, it seemed to be merely a more paganistic extension of their organised religion. However, as time went on, their activities grew darker. Animal sacrifices, then blood letting, before ending with a spree of gruesome murders.\n\nAt this point, the priest had decided to band together with loyal members of his community in an effort to remove them. However, according to the priest's final entry, this was unsuccessful due to the intervention of a demon. A creature which the priest describes as the root of all the ills which had plagued him.\n\nA demon he labels, the Windigo.\n\nAs the team finished reading this, they noticed a sudden drop in temperature. At first, this was merely attributed to the setting of the sun. However, as the temperature continued to plunge, well below the seasonal average, the team realised that something was gravely amiss.\n\nBy night, the air was frigid with each exhale turning into a white puff of vapour. It was in this climate, that the Windigo beset the investigation. This demon materialised from the ice and snow, transforming into a terrifying equine entity which stood nearly 10 meters tall.\n\nOnly Winter Frost managed to escape..."

Over the past few days, our garrisons throughout the Dread Peninsula have been mysteriously quiet, failing to communicate with Tarpian Rock. Not even the scribes at Magehold, who are usually a rather talkative bunch, have been able to get word through. This is highly concerning in light of the recent new related to the recent demise of the investigation looking into Headmaster Torygg's assassination.\n\nThen today, various border fortresses reported sightings of large equine creatures constructed of snow and ice. For now, they stay within the former lands of the Dread League. However, the mere sight of them is worrisome.\n\nIt's clear that the Windigos had taken great care in trying to disguise their actions.

POLITICS_TORYGG_DESC:0 "Headmaster Torygg has led the Arcturian Order for years. Stoic and proud, he has kept a long vigil over the lands to the north. Waiting for the day when the Dread League finally marches south to rid the world of all life. He is a quiet and confident individual. A veteran of the southern wars, he has come to realise his purpose in life is to guard against a greater evil than the world has ever seen."
POLITICS_OSTVALD_DESC:0 "Østwald Vind is a stern traditionalist. He upholds the code of the Arcturian Order to the letter, and will do everything he can to protect its values. He has seen many skirmishes with the Dread League's legions, and has seen first claw the terror that wild and uncontrolled magic can bring. Thus, he seeks to end the Dread League threat once and for all and to ensure such a thing can never happen. He seeks greater control on the world at large and believes the code of the Order should be upheld by all. Heretics should not be tolerated. The word of the code is law, and Østwald is its enforcer."
POLITICS_WILLIAM_DESC:0 "William Steel Beak is a reformer and a believer in harmony above all things. He adheres to the code of the Arcturian Order as all knights do, but believes that some of its harsher tenets should be more lax. Primarily this ideological split is based around the whole purpose of the order. William believes that the order can be a force for good in the world, not just a bulwark against the Dread League. He believes everyone can be redeemed and that the Arcturian Order's main focus should be to promote harmony in the wider world and to teach those who have fallen a better way of living. Popular with the soldiers and with those under his command, William is a reluctant leader who is much more comfortable leading his knights to victory than he is sitting in the senate. However, he is more than ready to take up the burden of leadership should it be needed."

It appears that she has been having nightmares, usually about her healed and purified face breaking apart to reveal her old undead appearance, or about being alone only to be struck by a beam from the Shield of Hope that disintegrates her. She admits to having fears that she is still far too scary for others to like, and that her bloodsoaked history might come back to wreak terrible havoc on all around her."

When the battle was finally over, it was discovered that the main enemy force was merely a distraction for a smaller enemy strike team which besieged the city's granary, burning the structure to the ground.\n\nWithout the granary, it is reported that the city only has a couple weeks worth of food left."
arcturian.22.a:0 "Those demons have no honour going after our food."

arcturian.23.t:0 "An Act of Brutality"
arcturian.23.d:0 "Bodies, just an endless pile of bodies. That is all that lies before our warriors at the End.\n\nIt all begin in the morning when a battalion of fresh recruits were expected to relieve our exhausted knights. Instead, just as they entered our view, they were immediately beset by the Dread League and slaughtered. However, this act alone was not enough for the sadistic necromancers before our walls. No, instead their leader began to dictate orders and over the next few hours, the bodies were meticulously arranged and assembled into a pyramid of desecration.\n\nBy dusk, the project was completed and the Dread League raiders faded into the night. Yet, even for hours after, our garrison refused to move. They were too sickened by fear to leave their safety in order to properly bury the dead.\n\nThis fear has begun to pollute our ranks, as tales of this atrocity spread like a plague throughout our lands."
arcturian.23.a:0 "We can't hide behind our walls forever."

arcturian.24.t:0 "Gunpowder Crisis"
arcturian.24.d:0 "The Sir Steele quarries are one of the most important strategic resources within our realm, as they produce nearly 80% of our saltpetre, a key ingredient in gunpowder.\n\nSo, it can only be called a disaster that the facility has been hit by a devastating raid. Last night, the nearby township, also known as Sir Steele, was raided by Dread League forces. In response, the local garrison commander drew his troops away from the site to engage the enemy and attempt to rescue the township. While successful in this endeavour, he did leave the quarries nearly undefended.\n\nClearly, the Dread League anticipated this, as upon the commander's return, he found the quarries ransacked with equipment destroyed, storage warehouses razed, and most critically, the tunnel network completely collapsed.\n\nIt will take ages to get this facility back online, all the while our armies have only needed an increasing quantity of gunpowder."
arcturian.24.a:0 "Will we be forced to return to the sword?"

 #arcturian.25.d:0 "Ours knights managed to plot the path of destruction laid out by the Dread League infiltrators, using it to determine the most likely location for their next raid. With this information, a whole chapter of our most elite knights were summoned and sent to intercept them.\n\nThis morning, our knights came in contact with the foe, and after a pitched battle, a final victory over the pestilence, poisoning our lands, has been achieved. While many of our brave knights were slain in the skirmish, all of the powerful necromancers were put to the sword. What remains are a few scattered ghouls and undead who over the coming days will be tracked and put down.\n\nCelebrations have erupted across our domains, as this little victory is a much-needed morale boost to our conflict ravaged populace."# Different duplicate from Eaw

arcturian.48.d:0 "Ours knights managed to plot the path of destruction laid out by the Dread League infiltrators, using it to determine the most likely location for their next raid. With this information, a whole chapter of our most elite knights were summoned and sent to intercept them.\n\nWhen they engaged, our knights were soon enveloped in an ambush, surrounding them almost immediately. While our knights fought bravely, they were battling on all sides and soon crushed under the sheer weight of the undead. The survivors were scattered, with few of our knights managing to make it back to friendly outposts.\n\nWhile news of this incident has been put under tight censorship, the Dread League's path of destruction can not be ignored as even more of our villages and towns lie in ruin."

arcturian.35.d:0 "Our brave knights recently annihilated the forces of the Dread League during a border skirmish.

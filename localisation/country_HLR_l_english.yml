#### intro
arcturian.1.t:0 "A History of the Arcturian Order\nThe Wardens of the North"
arcturian.1.d:0 "The North, it is  cold, dark, and sparsely populated. Upon which lies the Arcturian Order, and ancient holy order founded around the faith and ideals of 12 churches dedicated to the sanctity of The Holy Light.\n\nA Thousand years ago, on the long night, necromancers came pouring from the east. Large armies of undead cadavers in tow, they nearly overwhelmed the the lands now known as the Arcturian Order. Local church militant were the only ones capable of doing anything to stem the tide and push them back.\n\nThe century that followed saw the Arcturian Order being formed by Desmond the Fell-Claw, Holy Father of the Sun Goddess. The Arcturian Order was created for the sole purpose of protecting the living from the foul denizens from the east.\n\nEver since that fateful day nine hundred years ago, they have done their job.\n\nRecent years have written a different story however, as something is amiss in the Dread Peninsula. Border raids have increased in frequency and unicorns in the Order have felt dark energies accumulate beyond the borders. The twelve churches believe themselves ready to weather the storm.\n\nThe question is though, are we really ready for this?"
arcturian.1.a:0 "To answer that, we must look to the East"

### succession
arcturian.2.t:0 "The Mantle of Headmaster\nThe Future of the Arcturian Order"
arcturian.2.d:0 "The senate is in chaos, not one person can make heads or feathers of the situation. Headmaster Torygg is dead, murdered at the hooves of a changeling from an unknown hive. The Arcturian Order mourns the loss of Torygg, he was seen an upstanding and benevolent leader, his actions always adhering to a sound moral code.\n\nThe senate must choose a new Headmaster. A group within the senate has been advocating for one William Steel Beak, whilst a group of traditionalists within the senate have shown interest in Østwald Vind.\n\nWilliam Steel Beak was Torygg's first choice, as he had all the values and characteristics that Torygg saw as what the Arcturian Order needed. William is devoted to the common citizen and the well-being of the inhabitants, he understands the plight of the common Arcturian and is doing his best to answer their pleas. He even believes that anyone has the right to redemption, even the most tainted of hearts have that right in his eyes.\n\nØstwald Vind is an Arcturian traditionalist and follows his faith by the very script they are written in, he gives no room for interpretation. The Arcturian order is a tool against the undead hordes to the east, a bastion against the dead and nothing more. He loves the Order as much as the next griffon does, but through deliberation and hard work, he will see through to the Order's plans. Østwald Vind believes that once you tread down the dark path, the only redeption you will find is that of the bladed edge of a sword.\n\nBoth men love the Order, both men will serve to their fullest, but both men have different views on what is right and what is neccecary. The senate will need deliberate over this information."
arcturian.2.a:0 "Both candidates are promising, but a choice must be made"

arcturian.3.d:0 "After the assassination of Torygg, the economy fell apart. Uncertainty and fear had swept the nation, consuming all confidence among the citizenry. Smiths left their iron. Weavers left their looms and wardens left their posts at prisons. All progress towards modernization was halted as the government descended into chaos. \n\nThe situation is untenable, especially with the Dreaded Necromancers of Magehold knocking on our walls across the Holy Line. New policies or not, the new government must get the people working again.\n\n[HLR.GetLeader]'s next actions must be swift so that we may now focus our energies east. The time is nigh, and as the clock strikes eleven, we know the time of battle draws near. There is no longer room for Error."
arcturian.3.a:0 "Now we must focus on the real issue"

### Dread Attack
arcturian.4.t:0 "The Dread League Attacks!\nThe Arcturian Order Besieged!"
arcturian.4.d:0 "Decades of foreboding dread and years of preparation have gone into readying ourselves against this event! We received our news when the horns of war sounded at the eastern walls and massive hordes of skeletons heralded the first wave. It was beaten back, but [DED.GetLeader] is persistent and will not give up on her crusade against us or life itself.\n\nThe War Council has been called into session to deliberate over our options regarding the eastern menace which is the Dread League. Our options are limited, as is our time to consider them."
arcturian.4.a:0 "We knew this day would come\nWe must act quickly"

### Rosa Trial
arcturian.7.t:0 "The Queen's Trial\nThe Fate of Rosa Maledicta"
arcturian.7.d:0 "The War is over and Magehold is no more. Rosa Maledicta has been captured and awaits her trial. Tremendous effort is what lead us to this conclusion, and at great costs. The Dread Queen herself lies chained to the ground in the courtroom, her horn fitted with the strongest neutralizers available to the [HLR.GetName].\n\n One side of the court supports her redemption, saying that Rosa Maledicta will be a great asset if she is redeemed. They can be heard discussing the terms of her reformation, some of the tasks sound rigorous, and rightfully so. The former Dread League Queen will need to work for her redemption, as restitution for all the suffering she has caused.\n\nAt the end of this 'redemption plan', she will have earned the right to live as a free mare. The right to determine her own place among those she would have previously cast into ruin, the Rosa Maledicta will be able to live amongst the living.\n\nThe other side of the court desires only one thing, the death of Rosa Maledicta. It is the only solution in their eyes for all the crimes she has committed against the living. They would not settle for any other answer.\n\nA choice must be made, does she get to live? Or is her salvation to be found on the bladed edge of the executioners axe?\n\nWhat choice will [HLR.GetLeader] make?"
arcturian.7.a:0 "Her crimes are too much.\nShe will only find justice in execution."
arcturian.7.b:0 "No one is beyond redemption, not even the former queen of the Dread League"

### rose lives on
arcturian.6.t:0 "The Queen of the Dread League Reformed!\nThe Turning of a New Leaf"
arcturian.6.d:0 "Rosa Maledicta has proven her worth and reformed her ways, gone is the evil mad-mare who hates all life. What lies before us is a mare who worked for her freedom, who devoted her very soul to understanding friendship when we offered it to her.\n\nThe road was long an arduous, her worldview vastly different from that which any other pony would hold. Although the taint of dark magic will forever permeate her unnatural and twisted body, her mind now sings for all that is good in the world. She may be prone to some of her hold habits from time to time, but they do not define her as a pony anymore.\n\nShe has a place within the [HLR.GetName] as a general in our military, where with her newfound appreciation for life, has expressed eagerness to serve us. Strange times are upon us, the Dread League is gone, and the greatest adversary to have ever come from there is now our greatest ally."
arcturian.6.a:0 "As strange as everything may be.\nThe future can only get brighter"

### rosa wedding bells
arcturian.51.t:0 "A Holy Union Between Life and Death\NBells Ring for [HLR.GetLeader] and Rosa Maledicta"
arcturian.51.d:0 "Wedding bells ring throughout the capital, guests have gathered in the center of the Twevle churches. All attention in the [HLR.GetName] has converged on two individuals, [HLR.GetLeader] and Rosa Maledicta. Vows were exchanged under the watch of the Twelve, gazing lovingly into the eyes of the other as they did so.\n\nThe time came for them to kiss, and so they did. Forever united in holy matrimony, Rosa Maledicta and [HLR.GetLeader] are now lovers by law, and by love. This unbreakable union is now eternally recognized as the moment love conquered death."
arcturian.51.a:0 "They will make the perfect couple"

### call for help
arcturian.8.t:0 "The [HLR.GetName] Calls for Help\nDo We Send Them Our Aid?"
arcturian.8.d:0 "We have been visited by a messenger griffon from the [HLR.GetName] claiming to be under siege from skeletons and zombies. These bold claims are backed up by words alone, the messenger cannot provide the evidence that such a claim warrants.\n\nDo we answer their call for aid? We do not know how legitimate these claims are, but failing to help could lead to our demise if we do not aid their cause."
arcturian.8.a:0 "We should send them our soldiers to hold back this undead horde!"
arcturian.8.b:0 "We can only supply our weaponry, make sure they receive it"
arcturian.8.c:0 "We cannot, or will not help them"

### get manpower

arcturian.9.d:0 "[From.GetName] has sent us able bodies recruits to join our army. These soldiers are vital to our survival and the containment of the Dread League. We are forever in their debt."
arcturian.9.c:0 "We are eternally grateful for their aid"

### get guns
arcturian.10.t:0 "[From.GetName] Sends Us Weapons"
arcturian.10.d:0 "[From.GetName] has sent us weapons to aid in the fight against the Dread League. They will be assigned to the newest recruits and the divisions struggling to cope on the front lines."
arcturian.10.a:0 "Guns are better than nothing, we must ensure they are put to use!"

arcturian.11.a:0 "Our outlook on the future grows ever darker"

#### post-war events
#Rosa is excecuted
arcturian.26.t:0 "Rosa Maledicta Executed"
arcturian.26.d:0 "After many years of conflict, a daring capture, and and a surprisingly lengthy trial, the life of the leader of the Dread League came to and today when Rosa Maledicta was executed before having her remains destroyed in a lengthy process to prevent her from ever being brought back to life. Reactions among the people of Arcturia were mixed, with some claiming that the execution was a betrayal of their ideals, while other complained that it was too good for her. One thing’s for sure, it’s not a debate that shows any sign of being resolved soon, especially not with unrest still occuring on the Dread Peninsula."
arcturian.26.a:0 "What’s done is done"

#Problems in the dread peninsula

arcturian.27.d:0 "Despite the great victory of the [HLR.GetName] the Dread Peninsula is still plagued by dark rituals and necromancers, though fewer every day thanks to the efforts of our troops. On top of those rather standard concerns though comes reports of previously unknown dark presences haunting the land. To finally put an end to these problems the local garrison commander has requested reinforcements."

arcturian.59.d:0 "The initial investigation into Torygg's assassination revealed that it was indeed a changeling infiltrator who assassinated the headmaster. Experts are skeptical that such a changeling came from either Grenclyf or the far away Changeling lands, however none of his origins can be ascertained. The assassin has vanished without a trace it seems and without modern crime investigative technology, the Arcturian Order is left baffled. It seems this is a mystery which will not be solved for now. Fingers instead are pointed squarely at Rosa Maledicta's growing cult in the Dread Lands. Yet, investigators feel that something isn't quite right with the case. Clear pieces of evidence which were initially gathered seem to have gone missing and witnesses are surprisingly quiet about events who weren't before."
arcturian.59.a:0 "A mystery is afoot..."

#Torygg's diary
arcturian.60.t:0 "Torygg's Diary"
arcturian.60.d:0 "Late one night, [HLR.GetName] decided to enter the old study of Headmaster Torygg. More out of curiosity than anything else. After all, the room had been untouched ever since the investigation into his death had concluded. In fact, the maid had told [HLR.GetName] that Torygg had left explicit instructions not to clean it, or enter. Upon entry [HLR.GetName] is surprised to see maps and books and discarded sheets of ancient parchment. It seems Torygg was a bit of a scholar. Among the many volumes is a single leather bound journal which Torygg seemed to keep as a kind of diary. Its pages are confusing however, referencing some kind of hidden ancient power which has influenced all kinds of dark and unfortunate events. There is even scraps of vague evidence to support the theory. From the Prywhen Civil War, to the ancient conflicts of the three pony tribes, this dark force has been prevalent throughout history. An interesting read, but with such little evidence and stretched half truths, it is hardly a convincing read."

The old Griffon did not survive his wounds as he bled to death on the altar's podium.

#Rosa execution

arcturian.26.t:0 "Rosa Maledicta Executed"
arcturian.26.d:0 "After many years of conflict, a daring capture, and a surprisingly lengthy trial, the life of the leader of the Dread League came to and today when Rosa Maledicta was executed before having her remains destroyed in a lengthy process to prevent her from ever being brought back to unlife. Reactions among the people of Arcturia were mixed, with some claiming that the execution was a betrayal of their ideals, while others complained that it was too good for her. One thing’s for sure, it’s not a debate that shows any sign of being resolved soon, especially not with unrest still occuring on the Dread Peninsula."
arcturian.26.a:0 "What’s done is done"

arcturian.27.t:0 "Troubles on the Dread Peninsula"
arcturian.27.d:0 "Despite the great victory of the [HLR.GetName], the Dread Peninsula is still plagued by dark rituals and necromancers, though fewer every day, thanks to the efforts of our troops. On top of those rather standard concerns, though, come reports of previously unknown dark presences haunting the land. To finally put an end to these problems, the local garrison commander has requested reinforcements."
arcturian.27.a:0 "He shall have them"
arcturian.27.b:0 "We don’t have the troops to spare"

arcturian.28.t:0 "Disappearances on the Dread Peninsula"
arcturian.28.d:0 "The garrison commander has again contacted us, this time with a folder full of intel. Contained within are gruesome reports of disappearances and bodies found with signs of cannibalism. Other reports within the documents speak of large, emaciated creatures stalking in the distance. Things seem to be developing out of control in the Peninsula."
arcturian.28.a:0 "Those reports sound familiar somehow..."

arcturian.29.t:0 "Expeditionary Force Discovers Dark Activity"
arcturian.29.d:0 "The expeditionary force sent to the Dread Peninsula to reinforce the garrison has reported back with confirmed sightings of large creatures with emaciated hides and skeletal builds bent on consuming all flesh in sight. One of these creatures attacked a company of engineers and was only stopped when a Levy-Sergeant Chester Moltke used a flamethrower on it, whereupon it was killed. The creatures are not -- repeat, not -- undead."
arcturian.29.a:0 "A holy order’s work is never done"

#Rosa reformation

arcturian.30.t:0 "Rosa to be Reformed"
arcturian.30.d:0 "The senate have reached a decision, Rosa Maledicta is to be reformed, and the task of organizing the process has fallen upon the winged shoulders of the headmaster of the Arcturian Order. And it will have to be a process, for though her body and soul have been cleansed of all demonic, undead, discordant, or any other type of corruption the Arcturian Order has the ability to discover she is still not considered fully redeemed."
arcturian.30.a:0 "We shall soon see her mettle"

arcturian.31.t:0 "Meeting with William"
arcturian.31.d:0 "William is cheery as he greets Rosa at her new dwelling inside the inner walls of one of the larger castles, complimenting her on how well she looks without being dead from the neck up. She doesn’t seem sure how to take it, and her ever present guards are too professional to react. Nevertheless, William pushes forward with informing her of her first task."
arcturian.31.a:0 "You can do this, Rosa. You’re stronger than you think"
arcturian.31.b:0 "You must do this well. Your failure would shame us all"

arcturian.32.t:0 "Meeting with Ostvald"
arcturian.32.d:0 "It is dark when Ostvald goes to the isolated prison cell. He finds Rosa deep in meditation. He tells her that it is good that she is steeling her mind for the challenges ahead will be very difficult. She tells him she’s not afraid."
arcturian.32.a:0 "Good, for the night is long and full of terrors"
arcturian.32.b:0 "You will be, you will be..."

arcturian.33.t:0 "Rosa didn't like that"
arcturian.33.d:0 "Rosa didn’t seem to like her handler’s wording in advice. Perhaps a different tactic would have worked better, but it’s too late for that now. Doubt has started to work its way into her mind."
arcturian.33.a:0 "She can still be made to understand"

arcturian.34.t:0 "Rosa seems thoughtful"
arcturian.34.d:0 "Rosa pauses and considers the words of her handler carefully. She appears to have a genuine insight reach her. When it is time for her handler to leave she wishes him safe travels and says she’s looking forward to their next meeting."
arcturian.34.a:0 "The mightiest river begins with but a single stream"

arcturian.37.t:0 "Pony wants to make friends with Rosa"
arcturian.37.d:0 "While Rosa and her guards are out and about they stumble upon a pony who has recently immigrated to the land. The pony, a fishmonger named Melody Blossom, offers to break bread with Rosa and her guards, as she has yet to meet any ponies in the land who are not turned off by the smell of her wares. They talk for hours, and when Rosa’s handler goes to meet with her later that night she can’t stop talking about her new friend."
arcturian.37.a:0 "Don’t concern yourself with such relationships, they will only hurt you"
arcturian.37.b:0 "It is good to see you connecting with others"

arcturian.38.t:0 "Rosa rejects the advice"
arcturian.38.d:0 "Rosa seems incensed at her handler’s words, insisting that it doesn’t matter what he says, she is going to continue to see her new friend. Nevertheless, despite her insistence she can’t seem to an unsure look off her muzzle when they finally part ways for the night. It seems that his words have started to eat away at her psyche."
arcturian.38.a:0 "Soon enough she’ll learn, the only way to survive is on your own"

arcturian.39.t:0 "Rosa makes a friend"
arcturian.39.d:0 "Rosa continues to talk about Mellody, but then switches topics to talk about meeting others. It appears that she’s tired of staying cooped up, and now is becoming a social butterfly, at least for a time. Her handler tells her that it is up to others to accept her, but that he’ll be sure to take her to events where she bloom in full. When he leaves for the night he can see her talking with her guards as well."
arcturian.39.a:0 "Such joy should be shared"

arcturian.40.t:0 "Rosa worries she is too scary and corrupted"
arcturian.40.d:0 "During the latest visit Rosa’s handler found her pacing her room worriedly. It appears that she has been having nightmares, usually about her healed and purified face breaking apart to reveal her old undead appearance, or about being alone only to be struck by a beam from the Shield of Hope that disintegrates her. She admits to having fears that she is still far too scary for others to like, and that her bloodsoaked history might come back to reak terrible havoc on all around her."
arcturian.40.a:0 "You are right to fear, for the battle with one’s demons is without end"
arcturian.40.b:0 "Accept your past, but leave it there. You have been reborn"

arcturian.41.t:0 "Rosa’s fears grow worse"
arcturian.41.d:0 "Rosa has been left rattled by her handler’s words. She now spends almost every night tossing and turning without rest. She has admitted to one of her guards that she hates herself, and that she also hates her handler. She admits the sin of hating another though, and this further drives her into a spiral of self-loathing."
arcturian.41.a:0 "This is a burden we all must deal with"

arcturian.42.t:0 "Rosa's fears are assuaged"
arcturian.42.d:0 "Rosa has been sleeping much better recently. She still has nightmares, but with help from others she is able to overcome them. When she next meets her handler she thanks him for the confidence he has placed in her, for it has in turn given her the confidence to face her fears. It seems as though a great burden has been lifted from her withers."
arcturian.42.a:0 "We all need somebody to lean on"

arcturian.43.t:0 "Rosa's final test"
arcturian.43.d:0 "The final test before Rosa can truly be considered redeemed has come. It has been decided that she must embark on a quest along the ancient psychic path in the mountains where it is said that the founder of the Order first gained his cause and the Shield of Hope from Arcturia herself. Rosa must make that same journey, and bear the strain on her soul in full. If she returns successful then she shall be given a new surname, and her freedom."
arcturian.43.a:0 "You’ve grown so much since we first met, Rosa. You can do this"
arcturian.43.b:0 "Go now, and complete your journey"

arcturian.6.t:0 "Rosa Returns"
arcturian.6.d:0 "Today Rosa returned from her journey into the mountains. She had clearly been through more than her fair share of scrapes, but there was an inner light that burned within her that made all who gazed upon her say that she had become a true vision of righteousness and beauty. She also carried with her a unique holy relic of Arcturia, proving that she had been redeemed beyond a shadow of a doubt. Soon after she returned she stood before the Senate and the Grandmaster to join the ranks of the Arcturian Order as a new mare. The wicked Rosa Maledicta is dead, slain by Rosa Luminosa."
arcturian.6.a:0 "Rise, sister, for you are among friends"

arcturian.5.t:0 "Rosa Flees"
arcturian.5.d:0 "Rosa never returned from the mountains. The days stretched into weeks, then months, and still she did not appear. Then one day a report from a southern outpost came in describing a singed and terrified pony crossing the border came in. The description of the pony sounds like Rosa, clearly worse for wear. It appears that she failed in her test, and feld rather than face the shame of it. It’s unlikely we’ll ever hear from her again."
arcturian.5.a:0 "Rosa, you didn’t fail. I did"

#Dread League diplomacy events

arcturian.12.t:0 "Rosa Approaches For a Meeting"
arcturian.12.d:0 "In a startling turn of events we have been approached by the vampiric leader of the Dread League itself, Rosa Maladicta. In a magical message stuffed into the desecrated corpse of one of their undead soldiers the vampire lady claims that the continued fighting between our two factions is pointless, and that she would like to schedule a meeting in person to discuss an end to hostilities."
arcturian.12.a:0 "We have been fighting for so long… Why not?"
arcturian.12.b:0 "A trick, and a faint to boot!"

arcturian.13.t:0 "Dread League Goes For the Top"
arcturian.13.d:0 "Rosa met with the leader of the Holy Order recently on a small island off the coast. While their underlings discussed things in the main lobby of the lodge the vampire queen isolated the leader of the Holy Order in a room with a candlelight dinner and a magical artifact that plays a music from across the sea known as smooth jazz. She intends to discuss things more personally."
arcturian.13.a:0 "Let’s get down to business then"
arcturian.13.b:0 "Cut the theatrics, Rosa"

arcturian.15.t:0 "A Day on the Frozen Beach"
arcturian.15.d:0 "On the cold rocky shore where the arctic ocean met the island the leaders of two nations swore to be mortal enemies walked. Rosa Maledicta, the vampire queen, asked why they must fight. They are so much alike, both warriors, both servants of the supernatural, both locked away from the world in the frozen north. They have only eachother to spend time with, so why not spend it together?"
arcturian.15.a:0 "Why not?"
arcturian.15.a:0 "Because we hate each other?"

arcturian.14.t:0 "Dread League Talks Peace"
arcturian.14.d:0 "At a remote location negotiations have started between representatives of the Dread League and the Holy Order of Arcturus on the ever elusive topic of peace. The Dread League vampiric leader Rosa has opened as such though, speaking of peace and harmony, of an end to the fighting that has gone on for centuries. Her goal, she claims, is for everyone to lay down their arms and finally be free to go about their lives in peace. In the frozen wastes of the north, why add hardship by fighting?"
arcturian.14.a:0 "Harmony and peace? It’s what we’ve always wanted"
arcturian.14.b:0 "This is clearly a trick, you scoundrel!"

arcturian.20.t:0 "Dread League Turns the Table"
arcturian.20.d:0 "Rosa smiles cruelly at the anger of the Holy Order representatives. She laughs, and declares their hypocrisy to all. They claim to fight for peace and harmony, but when push comes to shove they seek only bloodshed. They decry the Dread League for doing without shame what they themselves revel in with lies. They may speak of the differences between them, but in actuality they’re already the same. What point is there to this war? The Dread League has already won."
arcturian.20.a:0 "She’s right, we’ve betrayed Arcturia. The darkness is all we have now"
arcturian.20.b:0 "All the darkness in the world cannot extinguish the light of a single candle"

arcturian.18.t:0 "Dread League Accepts Proposal"
arcturian.18.d:0 "After much deliberation, Rosa has decided to accept the proposal of her opposite number in the Holy Order. The world shall surely feel this day for years to come, for the undead hordes of the North shall soon be no-more. Rosa Maledicta has chosen her path, and it leads back to the light she shunned so long ago."
arcturian.18.a:0 "It is good to do good"

arcturian.19.t:0 "Dread League Rejects Proposal"
arcturian.19.d:0 "The Dread League has exited negotiations, and declared that there is to be war. It seems that the last proposal of the Holy Order was too much to contemplate. Rosa Maledicta has chosen her path, and it leads ever deeper into the darkness she ran to so long ago."
arcturian.19.a:0 "To do bad is so much better"

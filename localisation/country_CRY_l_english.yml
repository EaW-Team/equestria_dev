CRY_somviation_desc:0 ""At one point, I considered becoming an alicorn. It was a foolish notion. Who needs wings when you can fly a machine like this? I look forward to giving them a try myself, if they can be fashioned in such a way to harness my dark glory.""
CRY_strength:0 "Crystal Strength"

CRY_magicalconceptions:0 "Magical Studies"
CRY_magicalconceptions_desc:0 "Never before has the study of magic been so vital to our survival. Though we cannot hope to rival Equestria, we can at least pursue our own program so we can rely more on ourselves and less on foreign powers."
CRY_steel_factories_in_crystal_city:0 "Steel Factories\n in the Crystal City"
CRY_steel_factories_in_crystal_city_desc:0 "The more weapons and vehicles we produce, the more metal we need. Authorising the construction of additional steel mills in the capital will go a long way to making sure we have the resources to supply the military in a timely manner."
CRY_risingstorm:0 "Rising Storm"
CRY_risingstorm_desc:0 "The Changelings dare to threaten our land and desecrate her ponies. To counter this unprovoked aggression elite troops must be trained and deployed posthaste to defend liberty and freedom. These fiends have sown the wind, and now they shall reap the whirlwind of our rising storm!"
CRY_collectivisation:0 "Common Ownership of Land"
CRY_collectivisation_desc:0 "In this, our new nation, it is a crime that ponies still cling to the idea of private property. We must dash this idea, which is only a holdover from less enlightened systems."
CRY_welfare:0 "Social Welfare"

CRY_proletary:0 "Red Crystal Army"
CRY_proletary_desc:0 "The glorious army of the revolution will soon be complete! At least on paper. We always need new designs and more ponies willing to defend their comrades."
CRY_researchagreement:0 "Research Cooperation"

CRY_crystalscom:0 "Crystal Power"

CRY_altersource:0 "Peaceful Atom"
CRY_altersource_desc:0 "Our studies in atomics have allowed us the opportunity to expand our research capabilities to all fields and not just a couple, narrow ones. The glory of the people can now be brought to its fullest potential!"
CRY_magicalsource:0 "Magical Source"
CRY_magicalsource_desc:0 "The study of magic has already begun to yield results. The practical application of it will help boost our capacities in a number of fields. I can only imagine what it would be like to undertake some of our planned tasks without, say, telekinesis. We would have to waste time building and developing all manner of tools solely for the purpose of construction! This is much more efficient."
CRY_mining:0 "Mining"
CRY_mining_desc:0 "Our northern mountains are rich in minerals, this is known. But with modern Equestrian technology, our prospectors have managed to discover new veins of valuable ores that can be refined into metal! We should exploit these deposits as soon as possible."
CRY_socialist_union:0 "Socialist Union"

CRY_industry_f:0 "Factories on Empty Fields"
CRY_industry_f_desc:0 "The realm's core territory has around 10,000,000 persons of various species living in it, but most of the industrialisation is around Crystal City and its outskirts. These empty fields will be good locations for additional factories to support the military."
CRY_gunfactories:0 "War Effort"
CRY_gunfactories_desc:0 "The war has come! Countless ponies are now fighting and dying on the front lines, but who shall supply them? We must construct additional military factories for this task."
CRY_consumergoods:0 "Austerity Measures"
CRY_consumergoods_desc:0 "With the war raging the time has come to either tighten our belts or die as fat ponies. The Snow Austerity Law will cut government waste to ribbons and allow for faster growth in the industrial sector. Really, we should have done this years ago."
CRY_medicine_focus:0 "Crystal Medicine"
CRY_medicine_focus_desc:0 "Crystal ponies are famous for their fragility, and while this might just be a hurtful stereotype it's not hard to see where it came from. Our doctors are some of the best in the world, and our trauma centres are able to save almost anypony if they can just get there in time. Princess Cadence has called upon these valiant healers to lend their expertise to the military medical corp."
CRY_machinisation:0 "Mechanisation"
CRY_machinisation_desc:0 "The internal combustion engine that those two 'salesponies' made works far better than expected. I believe we can refine it and put it to use in a number of previously impractical military designs."

CRY_heavytanks_desc:0 "We must defend the royal family with all our might. Get out your pencils, ponies. It's time for some new designs."
CRY_aviation:0 "Crystal Air force"

CRY_crystals:0 "Crystals"
CRY_crystals_desc:0 "The Amethyst University has just made an announcement: They have discovered a new kind of crystal, one imbued with harmonic energy. It can help repair buildings, along with keeping our soldiers comfortable in both heat and chill. One scientist suggested the name Ragnite for it; another suggested Cadenzia. The name is still under review, but everypony agrees that the list of uses will only expand over time."
CRY_eqsforces:0 "Expeditionary Forces"
CRY_eqsforces_desc:0 "The external threats can no longer be ignored. While we're doing our best to arm ourselves, it's painfully clear that we require more brigades to guard the borders. There are eager volunteers over in Equestria - why not ask [EQS.GetLeader] to send them to us?"
CRY_eqsadvisors:0 "Equestrian Military Staff"
CRY_eqsadvisors_desc:0 "Calling upon the Equestrian military to help train our forces may seem counter to the wishes of many of our subjects, but we would be fools not to learn from their expertise."
CRY_eqsengineers:0 "Engineering"
CRY_eqsengineers_desc:0 "Among the Equestrian volunteers, there are those who'd be more useful in roles away from the front. Many of them come from an industrial and scientific background, and can contribute to our efforts in those fields."
CRY_eqsfactories:0 "Celestial Factory Program"
CRY_eqsfactories_desc:0 "Our recent industrial efforts have not gone unnoticed, and Equestria has reached out to offer support. The "Celestial Factory Program", as it has been called, is a proposed plan where Equestria would subsidize the industrial growth in the Crystal Empire, helping jumpstart our industrial progress. If this were to be enacted it would be a great help for our local industry."
CRY_subordination:0 "Subordination"
CRY_subordination_desc:0 "The Empire's reliance on Equestria is self-evident. Our future, as much as some nationalists may deny, will be inextricably linked with our southern neighbour. As such, our relations to them has to be finalised, one way or another."
CRY_independence_referendum:0 "Referendum for Independence"
CRY_independence_referendum_desc:0 "As much as we've come to depend upon Equestria, there is a national spirit among our people that cannot be quelled. The calls for a severing of Equestrian Dominion over the Empire have grown in volume. In order to placate both the nationalists and Equestria, Princess Cadence will call for a vote on the issue."
CRY_destroy_sombra_soup:0 "Find the Sombra Supporters"
CRY_destroy_sombra_soup_desc:0 "Now that the nation is secured, we must remove those who would bring back a threat even more dangerous to the common pony than the alicorns. Find them all, and root out these insane cultists."

CRY_somtories:0 "Factories"

CRY_somdarkcrystals:0 "Dark Crystals"
CRY_somdarkcrystals_desc:0 ""My latest personal project. I leave the technology to others. But I will show the world that my magic is still to be feared. With my will behind them, not heat, not cold, not wind, not rain, not guns, not magic, not anything will stand up to my will!""
CRY_magic_of_proletariat:0 "Ponies' Magic"

CRY_wintersun_desc:0 "Having failed to host an official celebration of the Winter Solstice the year prior, it would please our people if we hold a bigger festival this year. Let's host the greatest Winter Solstice celebration that the Empire has ever seen!"
CRY_crystallinganniversary_desc:0 "Our people hold a soft spot for Princess Cadence's family, and her daughter, Flurry Heart, is no exception. A public celebration of Flurry's birthday will doubtlessly draw large crowds and invaluable support."
CRY_equestriagames_desc:0 "The Equestria Games have long been a source of unity, good-natured competition, and raucous entertainment for those on the continent. The time for this grand sporting event is once again fast approaching, and the Crystal Empire has been chosen as host. If we take the initiative in the planning, we will send a powerful message about our bond with Equestria."
CRY_research_commie:0 "Crystal Materialism"
CRY_research_commie_desc:0 "We shall concentrate all of our power into the education and development of the Ponies' Academia, so that we may not only improve the quality of life of our citizens by means of technical development, but also safeguard our nation and world peace by maintaining a cutting edge of military technology."
CRY_umbrummilitia_desc:0 "Umbrum!"
CRY_umbrumdefeat_desc:0 "Defeat of Umbrum."
CRY_military_desc:0 "The world is changing; military conflict is becoming ever more common and bloody. If the Crystal Empire is to survive then its military must be the best it can be, better even. Therefor CRYCOM has put forward a two year plan to increase the organisational skills of the army so that they may better defend the realm."
CRY_miamore_desc:0 "In spite of our efforts to draw us closer to Equestria, there is still doubt over the viability of our relationship with our southern neighbours. The Princess believes that she can win the hearts of the sceptics if she tells them her family's story. Perhaps a book deal is in order?"
CRY_oldorder_desc:0 "The Crystal Empire has been gone for a millennium, and time has marched forwards without us. Despite what perceived slights that we may have suffered from them, Equestrians truly want to help us. In these trying times, it's best that we stick close to Equestria."
CRY_fortifications_desc:0 "The lead Guard Engineer has been tasked with building a snow fort. To this end he requires his tools, and 120,000 labourers working around the clock for 720 days. Such demands will put a strain on our ability to commit to other political measures during this time, but the results are bound to be impressive."

CRY_eqs_tech_share:0 "Crystal-Equestrian Research Network"
CRY_eqs_tech_share_desc:0 "With the recent issue of sovereignty handled we are now free to set up a communications network between R&D departments, universities, and crackpot laboratories all across both Equestria and the Crystal Empire. It is hoped that building these communication links will allow greater efficiency by way of specialisation."

CRY_eqs_strengthen_ties:0 "Strengthen Economic Ties"
CRY_eqs_strengthen_ties_desc:0 "Since it is clear that Equestria's future is our future it must also be clear that our Crystalline ponies really love Equestrian stuff. From rifles to rototillers, we can't get enough of that sweet Equestrian merchandise. We should allow more Equestrian companies to invest in the Crystal Empire to cut down on shipping costs and further integrate our nations."

CRY_deep_integration:0 "Deep Integration"
CRY_deep_integration_desc:0 "The time has come to wipe away the last vestiges of sovereignty and feudalism. With the new joint law of "deep integration" the governments of the Crystal Empire and Equestria shall become completely intertwined and indistinguishable. This can only lead to good things in the future, and experts agree that nothing can possibly go wrong with this."
CRY_free_trade:0 "Own Trade Policy"
CRY_free_trade_desc:0 "Free at last! We are free at last! However, things still cost money, and with our new freedom it's time we set a trade policy that shall truly benefit the Crystal Empire. We have immense resources beneath our Arctic land, shall we share them with world for great profit, or save them for a snowy day? Whatever our choice, it shall be our own."
CRY_free_trade_idea:0 "Crystal Trade"

CRY_world_metropolis:0 "World Metropolis"
CRY_world_metropolis_desc:0 "Our world is filled with countless species and cultures, and yet the magnificent Crystal City outshines them all. With a few subtle tweaks to government policy we can compound our advantages and turn the city into the cultural, economic, intellectual, and tourist capital of the world. The day may soon come when a Crystal Pony will be able to travel anywhere in the world, and still find reminders of home."
CRY_eqs_crystalcity_to_canterlot:0 "Crystal City to Canterlot Railway"
CRY_eqs_crystalcity_to_canterlot_desc:0 "When our nation returned, a rail line was constructed linking the Crystal City and Canterlot. As useful as this original line is, we can no longer get around the fact that relying on a single piece of track to transport millions of tons of goods and services every day is economic insanity. Roadways can never efficiently pick up this much slack, a new and larger rail network needs to be built."
CRY_miamore_forever:0 "Mi Amore Forever"
CRY_miamore_forever_desc:0 "House Amore has proven itself time and time again. There is no longer a shred of doubt in the hearts of anyone that [Root.GetLeader] is the right monarch for the job. Indeed, they've become so popular that pollsters have been encouraged to stop asking people about the subject to prevent the appearance of tyranny or rigging. It's time we do something else to show our great love and affection for House Amore."

CRY_royal_marriage_radiant:0 "Radiant Marriage"
CRY_royal_marriage_radiant_desc:0 "After all this time, how could Sombra have been so blind to what was in front of him all along? The one he loves is the one who loved him enough to bring him back from eternity. Radiant Hope shall be his queen, and he knows it shall be so. She would deny him nothing, and he can no longer stand denying her. The only thing to plan is the wedding."

crystalemp.25.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]The quiet of the early morning was shattered today when explosions rang out across multiple towns and cities in the Crystal Empire, including the capital itself. Witnesses report seeing Crystal Royal Guardponies in full uniforms breaking down the doors of homes, firefights in the street, and several bombs going off. When reached for comment, [Root.GetLeader] was quoted as saying, 'A cult that we have been watching for some time has recently crossed the line into terrorism. Rather than let our subjects be hurt by them we ordered the Royal Guard to apprehend them. It is regretful that there was violence, but rest assured that those who remain will be given the best medical care possible and fair trials when they are fit.' After that statement a poster appeared near the Crystal Palace that King Sombra's return is nigh - however, the perpetrator was found and arrested shortly after. It seems that at last, the threat of Sombra's return is over."
crystalemp.25.a:0 "Thank goodness!"
crystalemp.25.b:0 "I see."

crystalemp.26.t:0 "Equestria Proposes a Plan to Deal With Sombra"
crystalemp.26.d:0 "The Princess has received special guests from Equestria today. As the unofficial meeting began, grim looking ponies in suits and military officers explained how Sombra cultists have infiltrated the Crystal society, and even the upper echelons of the government, while the present Crystal officials and soldiers could only silently nod. As the guests explained, [From.GetLeader] has been extremely concerned about the possibility of King Sombra's return, and that the threat posed by his return has been underestimated for far too long. Finally, the pony in a uniform of a Colonel of Equestrian Royal Guard outlined the plan of a joint operation between Equestrian and Crystal agencies that would finally get rid of the threat once and for all. The ponies were ready and in position - the only thing required was the approval of [Root.GetLeader]."
crystalemp.26.a:0 "We cannot say no - the operation has our approval."

crystalemp.27.t:0 "Just another day"
crystalemp.27.d:0 "You've been going to meet your friends more and more lately, often for no reason other than to enjoy their company. Such is the case today.\nHowever, as you trot down the familiar streets leading to the Club, something feels....different. You can't quite put your hoof on it. You feel an urge to look over your shoulder, but see nothing of note. Perturbed, you continue onwards.\nAs you climb the stairs, the itch doesn't go away. You knock on the door, and it opens to reveal the familiar face of Peyote. The huge Stallion smiles down at you, murmuring a greeting. You reply and scurry inside, still feeling spooked. The gentle giant does not fail to notice, concern creasing the corners of his eyes. He opens his mouth to say something, but is interrupted as the unmistakable crack of breaking glass shatters the silence first. Cold winds blow into the apartment, bringing with them a small metal object. It bounces across the floor before exploding with a tremendous flash, no more than a meter away. Your ears feel like they are burning and you stumble about blindly, smashing your shin on a table and folding into a pile of limbs."
crystalemp.27.a:0 "Run!"
crystalemp.27.b:0 "Fight!"

crystalemp.28.t:0 "Flight"
crystalemp.28.d:0 "You scramble to your hooves, or try to. Animal instinct overwhelms you, and all you can think of is escape.\nYou stumble towards the front door, but it explodes off its hinges. You see it impact the dazed form of Dust with a sickening crack, audible even over the screams filling the room. You swerve to the left, ducking through the closest open door. Your eyes still hurt more than you can describe, but raw adrenaline keeps them open. You lunge for a window, fumbling with the lock. As you crawl out and try to balance on the windowsill, black figures pour into the room behind you, shouting demands. They advance, guns raised.\nYou try to shuffle to the side but only succeed in losing your grip. You totter on the edge, forelegs flailing. A feeling of vertigo runs down your spine and you try to lean back towards the window, but it's no use. One of the figures drops his weapon and dives. Time seems to slow as he rushes forward, forelegs outstretched. Your eyes meet his as his hooves brush against your fur, but it's too late. You tilt backwards..."
crystalemp.28.a:0 "So this is what it's like to fly?"
crystalemp.28.b:0 "I never told her that I..."

crystalemp.29.t:0 "Resistance"
crystalemp.29.d:0 "You scramble to your hooves, or try to. A burst of spiteful defiance swells up from deep in your chest. These people think they can just barge in here, ruin all the work everyone has spent so much sweat and blood on? How dare they!\nYou half-run, half-stumble your way to the kitchen, and wrench open the cupboard beneath the sink.\nYou shove your hoof deep inside, and soon feel the cold steel of a Cabaret pistol in your grip. You pray to whatever god is listening that it is loaded, before standing back to your full height, pistol at the ready in your mouth. Your eyes dart around, searching for enemies. Seconds later, a heavily armed figure dressed in black swoops through a nearby window. You hear the front door being blasted off it's hinges and the loud shouts of the intruders, but have no time to look. You snap your weapon onto the target, and fire.\n*click* \nOr try to, anyway. You pull the trigger several more times, but nothing happens. You don't have time to be confused for long, as a rapid *brrrp* emanates from his machinepistol. You are lying on the ground now...when did that happen? Everything feels so heavy....screams continue from the rest of the apartment, but they are fainter now...why is that? You want to lift your head to look, but can't muster the strength..."
crystalemp.29.a:0 "I think i'll just take a nap..."

cryscr.1.t:0 "Celebration is Planned!"
cryscr.1.d:0 "Due to the economic problems the government could not support the tradition with an official celebration of the Winter Solstice holiday last year. However, undoubtedly the situation will change during this year. And we will hold a grand festival on the Winter Solstice day!"
cryscr.1.a:0 "Hurray!"
cryscr.2.t:0 "Flurry Heart Birthday!"
cryscr.2.d:0 "Flurry Heart is the baby daughter of our current Princess, Mi Amore Cadenza. And today she is celebrating her second birthday! Congratulations to the happy family from all the ponies of our vast homeland, the Crystal Empire. Long live the Princesses!"
cryscr.2.a:0 "Yay!"
cryscr.3.t:0 "The Winter Solstice Celebration!"
cryscr.3.d:0 "One of many ancient tradition of the Crystal ponies is celebrating the winter Solstice, when the sun is lowest on the horizon and the night is longest. In medieval times it was an important turn in the season, as it meant that the first half of the harsh crystalline winter was finally over and that brought everypony hope for a warm spring and the start of the sowing season. The celebration was attended by many crystal ponies and tourists from Equestria with yet another visit of the Equestrian royalty."
cryscr.3.a:0 "Hurray!"
cryscr.4.t:0 "Equestria Games Preparations!"
cryscr.4.d:0 "[EQS.GetLeader] is planning to organise the next Equestria Games in Crystal City. It would be to our benefit to support this enterprise, because events such as these unite ponies and celebrate friendship among them."
cryscr.4.a:0 "Right."
cryscr.5.t:0 "Crystal Fair"
cryscr.5.d:0 "The Crystal Fair is one of the oldest traditions of the Crystal Empire and it is shame that we have to ask Equestria for permission and funds to hold the event."
cryscr.5.a:0 "I'm sure Princess Celestia will agree."
cryscr.6.t:0 "Crystal Empire wants to hold Crystal Fair"
cryscr.6.d:0 "Princess Cadance has requested us to support the Crystal Fair celebration. She fears that they simply cannot afford the entirety of its cost, and the Crystal Ponies could really use something to cheer them up. How do we respond?"
cryscr.6.a:0 "May I have an invitation, Cadance?"
cryscr.6.b:0 "We don't have money for that."
cryscr.7.t:0 "Equestria Agrees"
cryscr.7.d:0 "[EQS.GetLeader] granted us permission to carry out the Crystal Fair."
cryscr.7.a:0 "Great!"
cryscr.8.t:0 "Equestria Refuses"
cryscr.8.d:0 "[EQS.GetLeader] denied our proposal of holding a Crystal Fair."
cryscr.8.a:0 "Aww!"
cryscr.9.t:0 "Story of Mi Amore Family"
cryscr.9.d:0 "A new biography of Princess Mi Amore Cadenza has hit bookstores this morning, and it has sold like hot cakes. The biography details her life, from her time as an orphaned Pegasus, to her ascension, to her marriage, and finally to her rule of the Crystal Empire. What is most surprising about the book is the candid nature of the writing: very little is kept private, and the words describe a sincere image of a kind family mare, warts and all.\n\nThe struggles depicted in the biography have renewed interest in the Royal Family among Crystal Ponies, leading to greater solidarity with the Mi Amore family and the Equestrian Crown."
cryscr.9.a:0 "We represent the ponies."
cryscr.10.t:0 "Grand Festival"
cryscr.10.d:0 "We have finally held our first Grand Festival since the banishment of Sombra by the Elements of Harmony! A Thousand years ago, before the disappearance of our empire, it was an annual holiday where we showed the world the beautiful products of our craftsponies: rigorously made crystals, durable armours, diamond-sharp swords! Now we are ready to show the world our strong tanks, precise rifles, swift aircraft and magnificent goods!"
cryscr.10.a:0 "Hurray!"
cryscr.11.t:0 "A Group of Dissidents"
cryscr.11.d:0 "Rumours spread across the Crystal City that there exists a group of ponies that support the old Sombra regime. That is very unlikely, because there are still ponies that have lived under Sombra's tyranny and horror of his enslavement lives in the hearts of the crystal ponies. Regardless, a spectre from the past haunts the Crystal Empire."
cryscr.11.a:0 "That can't be true."
cryscr.12.t:0 "An interesting meeting"
cryscr.12.d:0 "On one ordinary [GetMonth] day in the Crystal City, you are walking through the streets. You stop near a souvenir shop and glance at the poster behind the front display window. A pony in over-exaggerated, heavy chains languishes in the foreground, while a dark silhouette of King Sombra looms in the background. "May tyranny never return to the Crystal lands" reads the writing. "Who would ever pin that in their room?" You wonder aloud. Suddenly a young, pretty pony with light pink coloured fur and a dark blue mane stops nearby as you continue gazing over the poster. You turn and find her also staring through the window. "I hope he will return one day." She says quietly. "What?" You ask. "Have you never wondered what the Crystal Empire would be like, if King Sombra returned?" she replies. You look at her, stunned. "Come join us to find out" she says and puts a note into your hoof."
cryscr.12.a:0 "I need to take part in this."
cryscr.12.b:0 "Are you crazy?!"
cryscr.12.c:0 "I will support, without participating personally."
cryscr.13.t:0 "Interesting Development"
cryscr.13.d:0 "You are given an invitation to a club called "Stories of the Frost", as it says on the card. The description on the other side reads: "Join the historical literature club of the Amethyst University! Tea, cookies and long talks about world history are guaranteed! Top floor, door 37." Sounds like fun, you think. The mare, however, walks away before you can ask anything else. On the other side of the invitation card you can see a detailed map leading to the club."
cryscr.13.a:0 "I will have to check that out."
cryscr.13.b:0 "Not worth it, eh."
cryscr.14.t:0 "Forget it!"
cryscr.14.d:0 "You throw the invitation card away. Whirling in the light breeze, it falls down onto the pavement. "Are you serious? Why would you want that?! He destroyed our country! He..." You don't get to finish, as the pony turns away. She gives you a scornful glance as she goes. You turn around and walk away, wishing to forget this incident ever happened."
cryscr.14.a:0 "Youngsters these days."
cryscr.15.t:0 "It's about time"
cryscr.15.d:0 "It's been a while since you met the mare near the souvenir shop. However, you kept the card and today you finally had the time to follow the instructions that supposedly should lead you to the location of the club. There was something alluring in that card, that mare, and what she said that day. You took a walk through the streets and found yourself at the end of the suggested route. An ordinary, newly built apartment building stands in front of you."
cryscr.15.a:0 "Right into the 37th."
cryscr.15.b:0 "What am I doing?"
cryscr.16.t:0 "First Meeting"
cryscr.16.d:0 "You climb all the way to the top floor of the apartment building. Anticipation slowly fills you as you climb the stairs. After knocking on the wooden door, you are greeted by a stallion garbed in an old, dusty magicians robe. "Is this some kind of cosplay meeting?" You think silently. The stallion motions you to come in and closes the door behind you. The apartment is illuminated only by pony magic, candles, luminous plants, and crystals. Despite this terrible lighting system, you can distinguish a bunch of ponies on the couch, at the table and on the floor. Suddenly the mare you met at the store trots out of a dark doorway, which you suppose leads to the kitchen. "I was waiting!" she exclaims with excitement."
cryscr.16.a:0 "Oh, huh?"
cryscr.17.t:0 "The Club"
cryscr.17.d:0 ""Welcome to the History Club! Hurray!" She cries joyfully. The other ponies support her with weary hurrahs of their own. "We study magic, literature, history, politics and evolutionary science here, but most importantly, we are united by one idea: the belief that the Crystal Empire needs Sombra back!"\n"And what makes you think this is such a good thing?" you ask after contemplating for a few seconds. "Apparently this guy has never read a history book before!" Quips one colt from his poorly illuminated perch. A wave of quiet giggling fills the room. "What do you know that I don't?" You say, irritated. "Sit down" Says an old stallion, who, like the door guard, is also wearing an antique magicians mantle."
cryscr.17.a:0 "Sure thing, gramps."
cryscr.17.b:0 "Why, though?"
cryscr.18.t:0 "The Stories of the Frost"
cryscr.18.d:0 "You sit down at a coffee table at his request. A peculiar crystalline flower bathes both of you in an eerie turquoise glow as the wizened old stallion begins his story.\n"I remember the King. I remember a time when the Crystal Empire was great and powerful, was really an Empire. The lands of the Yaks were under our control, the Northern Shores were our second home, and our flag was even planted in the soil of the savage Deer. The Crystal Ponies were true masters of Equestria and beyond. The soil was rich, the grass was green, the empire thrived and the ponies were free. It was then that the Alicorn sisters of Equestria started to become jealous of our greatness and power. Using the dark magic of the so-called Elements of Harmony, they imprisoned the king and all of the Crystal ponies in a place outside time and space for more than a thousand years. And now, the Crystal Empire is shamelessly trod upon by the sisters of Equestria and their unlawfully installed puppet, "Princess" Mi Amore Cadenza. Their greedy hooves take away all the treasures of the Crystal Empire, giving nothing in return. Thus, the only hope for the Crystal Ponies, the only way for them to gain the future they deserve, is through the return of King Sombra. With our help and his magic, we will restore the old glory of the Crystal Empire!".\nThe stallion ends on a triumphant note, but the effect is somewhat ruined as he starts coughing furiously a second later."
cryscr.18.a:0 "I... see."
cryscr.19.t:0 "An Offer of the Lifetime"
cryscr.19.d:0 "For more than two hours the ponies narrated to you the history of the Crystal Empire, told you of the time when King Sombra ruled over the land. That he was wise, just and caring to the ponies. That the sisters envied his glory and majesty. All of this greatly differed from the Equestrian narrative, but sounded so convincing and motivational.\n"We've been watching you for many moons," says the old pony suddenly. "We know you want to help. We know you want to aid King Sombra's escape from his shameful prison. The crystal ponies must rise against decay and oppression. The time is perfect, frankly, as the stars align in the correct position only once every five hundred years. It is the best time for the incredibly powerful reincarnation spells that will be called for. There is a way to bring King Sombra back, but we need your help! Together we will change the history of the Crystal Empire, and maybe the whole world, for the better!""
cryscr.19.a:0 "Me? Change the world?"
cryscr.20.t:0 "The Decision"
cryscr.20.d:0 "You exit the apartment and walk home, reconsidering your life choices. You were offered a chance to change history. Are you really that powerful? Do you really have the right to decide the fate of millions of ponies? "The group believes that I'm one of them, but what if they really succeed?" You whisper. "Maybe I should report this all to the police while I still have the chance?" The churning thoughts in your head cause you to lose your bearings, leaving you endlessly wandering through the streets of the Crystal City. You get home late in the evening and sit down at the kitchen table, head clasped in your hooves. Suddenly, you realise what must be done."
cryscr.20.a:0 "I have to join!"
cryscr.20.b:0 "This organisation is a threat to peace and harmony!"
cryscr.20.c:0 "I'm not the one they're looking for."
cryscr.21.t:0 "Reported"
cryscr.21.d:0 "The next morning you immediately go to the nearest police station and report everything that you've been told. Police and Royal Guard squads are immediately scrambled to the apartment. As the assault team smashes the door off it's hinges, the screams of the shocked conspirators fill the air. A huge stallion emerges from a side-room and tries to resist, but the policeponies are well-trained. In short order, every member of the "Club" is seized or gunned down. As they are taken down the steps and towards the waiting police van, you notice the cream-pink mare amongst them. She is tightly bound with hoofcuffs, and clearly terrified of what awaits her. She notices you in the crowd, and her eyes widen in shock. You suddenly realise that you never even asked for her name... As you contemplate the strange feeling curling around your heart, the last of the conspirators are bundled into the van. The doors are slammed shut, and within seconds they have been taken away."
cryscr.21.a:0 "I did the right thing... didn't I?"
cryscr.22.t:0 "The Return of Sombra"
cryscr.22.d:0 "You wake up to a terrible, shattering noise. As you roll out of bed and stand up, you see a huge cloud of smoke billowing across the skyline outside your window. The sound of aircraft engines is roaring in your ears. You hastily gather up your things and rush out onto the street. Ponies everywhere are running around in panic, or else standing in a daze. "Sombra has returned!" You hear somepony scream in the crowd. Suddenly, you hear gunshots in the distance. Several hours later you find yourself in a drafting centre. A rifle is shoved into your hooves and you are ordered to head towards one of the many barricades popping up all over the city. "Protect your Princess, Protect Harmony!" exclaims the sergeant. Sombra's supporters are taking up arms, and his return has almost immediately escalated into an all out civil war. A kind of war that the Crystal Empire has never seen before. It looks like the club succeeded after all..."
cryscr.22.d_com:0 "Sudden nightmares and intense dread interrupt your thoughts; you look outside and see billowing plumes of smoke from the capital. Engines roar as a squadron of aircraft flies overhead. Confused ponies are running all over the place. One voice can be discerned through all the noise, likely the result of a pony speaking into a megaphone. "Sombra has returned, comrades! Take up arms! Defend your homes, your families, your city, your country! Sombra was banished once! It will happen again, and we will show the world that our might is enough!" Some time later, the conscription begins in earnest, and you are not spared; you are given the bare necessities; a gun, ammunition, and a small knife, before being dispatched to the front lines. It would seem that Sombra's cult, that club, has succeeded..."
cryscr.22.d_fas:0 "After coming to power in the Empire, [Root.GetLeader] has finally been able to go about her work without secrecy or impediment. With the full resources of the state at her disposal, what once seemed like a daunting task has proven remarkably easy. All the necessary ritual materials have been prepared, and King Sombra can now be returned to the waking world with little more than an order.\n\nAfter so long, it almost feels anti-climactic for it to happen like this..."
cryscr.22.a:0 "No way."
cryscr.22.b:0 "That was quick."
cryscr.23.t:0 "Back to the Club"
cryscr.23.d:0 "After a while you are fully convinced that the return of Sombra is necessary to secure a better future for the Empire and its citizens. You return to the club, where you now meet only four ponies. Sakira Bluebell, the pink-furred earthpony from before, with her dark blue mane and deep violet eyes. Dust Snowfall, the old earthpony stallion with pale-light ochre fur, a long, grizzled mane, and a perpetually tired look on his face. Lake Frost, the light-blue, nearly white unicorn with reflective dark-blue hair, the one who wore the magician's mantle before. And new to you, Red Peyote, a huge pony who wouldn't look out of place guarding a nightclub entrance. You jokingly wonder if the only part of his body without extra muscles stacked on is his horn. It is a pleasure to meet you." says Snowfall. "We have been developing a plan to bring King Sombra back from limbo for many moons now. Your assistance will be extremely helpful."
cryscr.23.a:0 "I'm in."
cryscr.24.t:0 "Knowledge of the elders"
cryscr.24.d:0 ""In order to release King Sombra from his magical prison, we need to acquire both an ancient rune and a crystal heart charged with dark magic. With these, we will be able to replace the Crystal Heart and weaken the veil between the world of the living and Limbo, where King Sombra is imprisoned. We know that the secrets of reincarnation magic and the formula to create the Dark Heart can both be found amongst the many scrolls and books in the library of Amethyst University. However, dark magic is strictly forbidden by law in the Empire and access to the Forbidden Section requires the very highest level of security authorisation. We will have to resort to extreme measures: enchanting the librarians and guards. This is a dangerous enterprise, are you with us?""
cryscr.24.a:0 "That's why I'm here."
### rework
cryscr.25.t:0 "On the way"
cryscr.25.d:0 "The next day, you join up with Sakira on one of the central streets. She waves to you from the other side of the street and you rush across in a barely restrained dash, despite the lack of traffic. Once by her side, the two of you begin to walk. You could almost describe it as a fun stroll with a friend...If it weren't for the fact that you are both intending to change history. As you chat, Sakira gives you a look into her life. It turns out that she is a history student. She had always admired King Sombra, even before joining the Club. After meeting Dust Snowfall and hearing the old Stallions stories, she decided to dedicate her life to saving King Sombra."
cryscr.25.a:0 "I see."
cryscr.26.t:0 "Entrance"
cryscr.26.d:0 "You link up with the second part of the group. Only Peyote, the bouncer stallion, isn't here. The giant university library looms in front of you. In silence, you trot up the stairs. Inside, an old librarian greets you. She is very familiar with all of you, even Dust. Every gentle hoofstep and hushed comment reverberates back at you as you pass the mare and journey through the silent, magnificent halls. The only other signs of life here are students, quietly reading their study books and whispering to each other. You head to the centre of the hall, then turn left, all the way to the wall. Between the shelves, another turn to the left, some more turns, into a passageway, and... there it is! "The Forbidden Section". Two guards are playing chess on a coffee table near the door. The plan springs into action. Sakira approaches the guards and distracts them with small-talk. Meanwhile, using all his power, Lake casts a charm spell on the stallions. Their eyes turn green and they return to their unfinished game, apparently unconcerned. "I practised that for many moons." Lake says, panting slightly. He takes a pair of keys from the guards, and opens the door..."
cryscr.26.a:0 "Forward."
cryscr.27.t:0 "The Library"
cryscr.27.d:0 "You've spent three hours in the library. Although the ancient and dusty tomes were sometimes ardours for to read, they proved very useful in your studies. Most of your time was spent walking around the shelves, trying to find the required books. In the end, everypony gathered to the centre of the Forbidden Section. "We need to hurry, the spell on those guards won't last forever." Dust murmurs in a warning tone. "Well" you start "as it turns out, three things are required to succeed. First, some basic crystal rocks. Second, a red Umbrum crystal. And third, time for the Dark Heart to grow. We will have to head into the Mountains in order to find the crystals." As you finish, Dust speaks up approvingly. "That is right. And after we have procured them, we shall spread the crystals around the city and fill them with magic. This will make the reincarnation spell much stronger in the end." He opens a book and levitates it around around slowly for the benefit of the group. "And here is the pentagram that we will have to draw, before casting the spell.""
cryscr.27.a:0 "Answers, finally!"
cryscr.30.t:0 "Hit the road"
cryscr.30.d:0 "You studied everything carefully many times over the next few days. As you did so, the connection between you and others became even stronger. You were working hoof in hoof as partners, as friends. And now it is time to go on a journey in search of crystals. But the destination is yet to be decided."
cryscr.30.a:0 "The Umbrum Cage."
cryscr.30.b:0 "Snowybury awaits!"
cryscr.31.t:0 "The Umbrum Cage"
cryscr.31.d:0 "You head south on hoof, to the gently sloping hills and perilous mineshafts of the Umbrum Cage. This sparsely populated region adjacent to the Neighgara high-lands received its name due to its unusually rich veins of Umbrum crystals. You follow your map to one of the old mines. The whole region is abandoned. You trot past the eerie sight of broken stone huts overrun by plants, and the rusted skeletons of antiquated carts and machinery. No work has been done here for centuries. When the Crystal Empire disappeared, this place did not. We truly are a nation of time travellers, you muse. Finally, you arrive at the right mine. "Are you sure that this will have what we need?" You ask uncertainly. "I've checked the maps and books over and over." Lake replies with a hint of irritation. "This place was a major mine before we disappeared, and it clearly hasn't been exploited at all since then. So it should be just as rich now as it was back then.""
cryscr.31.a:0 "Alright then."
cryscr.32.t:0 "The Crystal Mountains"
cryscr.32.d:0 "The air near the mountains is cold and fresh. At the foot of the mountain lies the town of Snowybury, once quite popular with tourists due to its location. Beautiful forests and waterfalls dot the landscape, while healing springs and skiing resorts higher up the mountains attract many crystal ponies. The Crystal Empire truly is a wonderful country! The town itself is very quiet and stereotypically "rural" place in the endearing, quaint sort of way. Despite it being practically the most northerly outpost of ponykind, cultivated fields are scattered all around. But you can't waste time appreciating the beauty of your homeland. You and your friends arrived here with a purpose."
cryscr.32.a:0 "Lovely place."
cryscr.33.t:0 "The Caves"
cryscr.33.d:0 "After a day spent checking out the landmarks, you finally get an opportunity to separate from the main crowd of tourists. You duck into a cave entrance and begin to make your way deep into the mountain. "Are you sure we won't get lost?" Sakira titters nervously as you you descend into darkness. Already, all sources of illumination have vanished except for Lake's magic and a small flashlight taped to Dust's head. You think you can feel the temperature dropping with every dozen steps. Within minutes, the students are already shaking from cold and each exhale brings forth a cloud of steam. The coldness of the mountain bites to the bone, and you start to feel as if you have a sore throat. As you are busy climbing down a nearly vertical incline, you suddenly realise that you can barely feel your hooves. You progress even further, until suddenly you round a corner and see the faint glow of crystals in the distance. Everypony hastens their pace. You come out into a big grotto with a clean, beautiful underground lake. The still, perfect surface of the lake transitions seamlessly into hard stone. Rich and intact crystal deposits of various colours dot the walls and floor, sometimes stretching up from the ground to a height greater than a pony. Some of the crystal formations glow faintly, but the main source of the sky-blue light you saw earlier proves to be the lake itself. Or rather, what is inside it. Looking down through the perfectly clear liquid, you see HUNDREDS of crystals. And at the centre of the treasure-trove, one pure red spike can be seen. This is it. An Umbrum crystal."
cryscr.33.a:0 "There it is."
cryscr.34.t:0 "Red Crystal"
cryscr.34.d:0 ""Let's get this over with." You say. Sakira takes a hammer and starts searching for a good ordinary crystal. You turn to Lake. "Lake, can you pull out the red crystal? We need to get out of here before we all freeze to death." "I can try." He replies, noticeably shaking. He steps closer to the lake and as his horn flashes with light, an identical aura appears around the crystal at the bottom. But nothing happens. He clenches his teeth, and a second layer of glow bursts into life over his horn as his legs begin to shake. It doesn't help. Lake falls to the ground suddenly. You rush over to check on him, but thankfully it seems like he has just fainted. "Sweet Celestia" You whisper. "One of us will have to dive" says Dust. After glances from the group, he elaborates. "It would take incredible skill at magic to dislodge that. A physical approach would be much easier.""
cryscr.34.a:0 "I will."
cryscr.34.b:0 "Sakira."
cryscr.34.c:0 "Dust, you're experienced."
cryscr.34.e:0 "Sakira, let's do it together."
cryscr.35.t:0 "Deep water"
cryscr.35.d:0 ""I will, I can do it. Sakira, give me the hammer, let's finish this." You say with determination. "Oh...okay" agrees Sakira reluctantly. She hoofs you her hammer. You take the tool and stare into the water for a few seconds. Then, without further ado, you steel yourself and jump in. The water is colder than you can describe, so cold that it burns. You try to dive to the bottom as fast you can, but the pressure increases and it's hard to move. After what feels like hours but can only have been seconds, you find yourself about a meter before the glowing red crystal. Swinging desperately, you feel the reverberations from each strike pulse up your legs. Another swing. And another. Spasms and convulsions wrack your back hooves as pain takes over. One more swing. One more. A crack! And at last the red crystal dislodges, now floating gently. You grab the beautiful thing with both hooves and push off from the bottom of the lake. You breach the surface gasping for air, leaving the hammer in the lake forever. You feel delirious, ready to faint. But through it all, you can't help but muse proudly "What a team we are....""
cryscr.35.a:0 "..."
cryscr.36.t:0 "Red and pink"
cryscr.36.d:0 ""W-why me? I-I'm scared." Sakira looks at you and Dust in shock. "I can't even swim." You say. "You need to do it for Sombra! The future of the Crystal Empire might depend on you right now, we won't be able to come back here." You reason. "You... You're right." she breaths unevenly, but tries to control it. You put a hoof on her back and murmur some gentle reassurances. "For my people" she says, suddenly filled with determination. She takes the hammer into her mouth with a short, firm nod. Jump. Splash. She swims very well apparently. You anxiously worry, imagining what the water feels like. After a long minute of waiting, Sakira breaks through the surface again, coughing violently. You and Dust immediately leap into action to help her out. She is ice cold to the touch and shaking uncontrollably, but the red crystal is with her."
cryscr.36.a:0 "Well done."
cryscr.37.t:0 "Old pony's job"
cryscr.37.d:0 ""Move aside, youngsters". Dust immediately accepts his task without persuasion. You feel your respect for the experienced old Stallion grows even stronger. Despite his age, he is willing to do anything for the hope of King Sombra's return. He takes Sakira's hammer into his mouth and jumps into the lake. You exchange hopeful glances with Sakira. Dust's swimming pace is rather slow. You try to imagine what the water must feel like, and grimace at the result. After a minute of waiting, Dust finally breaks through the surface once more. You and Sakira quickly run to the bank to help him out, but he doesn't look concerned or exhausted. But more importantly, the Umbrum crystal is there, tight within his grasp."
cryscr.37.a:0 "Good job."
cryscr.38.t:0 "Freeze together"
cryscr.38.d:0 " "Sakira, it will be easier if we do this together. We can break the crystal and help each other swim. We are stronger together, this is the smartest way." You reason, staring earnestly at her. "oh, uh..." she sighs,"Okay... Let's do it." Both of you take deep, preparatory breaths before stepping up to the brink. You look over at her and give her a wry smile, squeezing her hoof reassuringly. Then, the pair of you jump into the lake. The water is so cold that it burns. Struggling, you both push your way down. It becomes harder and harder to move as the pressure increases. As you approached the crystal, you grab it with both hooves and try to pull, while Sakira attacks it at the base with the hammer. You witness hit after hit, and each passing second feels as if it is a minute long. Finally, the crystal breaks and you quickly struggle to the surface, dragging Sakira up with you by her hoof. You are both freezing and shaking, but the job is done."
cryscr.38.a:0 "Made it."
cryscr.39.t:0 "Umbrum Retrieved"
cryscr.39.d_player:0 "With great trouble you and the group retrace your path back out of the caves. You are exhausted and frozen, but victorious. Now that the crystal has been found and retrieved, it is time to change history. Struggling to stand on your frostbitten hooves, you require assistance to walk. You get back to Snowybury and spend a night in the hotel. You start to feel very sick, and from time to time you burst into terrible, wretched coughing. Sakira tries to take care of you, bringing you hot tea and medicine, changing your clothes as you sweat. But it gets worse, and you can't help but wonder if you will ever get better...."

You get back to the hotel in Snowybury and spend a night there. Everypony needs rest, especially Sakira who soon develops a serious cold. You try to help in any way you can. You bring tea and medicine to her bed, keep the fireplace warm, and hold her hoof reassuringly. Between terrible coughing fits, she smiles in sick delirium and assures everypony around her that this is all fine. She is as close to achieving her goal as she's ever been, and so she is happy."
cryscr.39.d_dust:0 "With great trouble you and the group retrace your path back out of the caves. You are exhausted and frozen, but victorious. Now that the crystal has been found and retrieved, it is time to change history. Things are going rather great. However, when you get back to your hotel room for some well-deserved rest, you notice that Dust Snowfall is starting to feel dizzy and sick. His age, seemingly irrelevant for so long, suddenly makes itself felt. He develops a high temperature, followed by a horrific cough. The three of you do everything you can to help the old stallion, but it is obvious that he requires professional medical treatment."

With Dust having to help Lake, you and Sakira walk together, supporting each other. By the time you arrive at the hotel room, it is apparent that both you and Sakira have caught a cold. Both of you spend a rough night dealing with dizziness, fever and coughing fits. It is obvious that you will require medical treatment when you arrive back in the Crystal City."

"It will take roughly one to three moons for the Dark Heart to grow in strength. Now that we have succeeded, we must pass on the news to the leader of our cause, so she may prepare the Movement across the Empire. But... Not anypony else. We need to be even more careful from now on. If the police arrive to search the apartment, we're doomed. We should consider moving to a safer place.""

cryscr.41.d:0 "As there are no civilised places to rest, you decide that you need to set up a camp in one of the abandoned stone houses. As you look for a good structure, you suddenly hear voices inside your current candidate. You look inside through a hole in the wall. The house doesn't have a roof and inside of it, everything is covered in lush plants, grass, flowers, and a dogrose bush. Inside, on what appears to be the fallen roof, two foals are playing with sticks and dolls. When they notice you, they back off, scared."

cryscr.42.t:0 "Foals"
cryscr.42.d:0 ""You've got nothing to be afraid of here, I'm just a traveller passing by, looking for a place to stay." You say. The ponies look relieved, but alert. "T-there are never ponies around here" says one foal, a filly with blue fur. "Ah, well, we uh, we were investigating the mines, for... scientific reasons" - you say - "I'm here with a group of my friends..."\nThe Foals decide to stay with you for some time. Eventually, you ask them what they think about King Sombra. - "My parents told me that he enslaved everypony, and there was no friendship or harmony when he was here." - says the colt - "Celestia and Luna freed us from him. We are free now"\n"What if they are wrong?"\n"We'd need Sombra back to find that out" - he jokingly replies. "Anyway, we should get back to our village, the sun is going down."\nYou find little sleep that night. Your thoughts are consumed by questions. Who is King Sombra? What will he really do? How will the ponies react to his resurrection... The clear sky glimmers with beautiful stars as you lie on your back, wide awake."
cryscr.42.a:0 "Right..."
cryscr.43.t:0 "Foals"
cryscr.43.d:0 ""Shh-shh, calm down. Hey guys, come here, I've found some foals here!" You shout to attract the attention of your friends. The foals exchange glances and run away through a tiny hole in wall. "No, wait!" you cry, but they have already vanished. "Foals? Where?" Sakira asks as she approaches. "I... They ran away..." You admit, looking apologetic. "You shouldn't have screamed like that, good heavens!" Sakira rolls her eyes. "You scared the foals. Ugh, no matter. Anyway, this place looks good enough." You and your friends set up camp in the house. The sight of the sky, filled with beautiful, glimmering white stars, is the last thing you see before you close your eyes and fall into a deep, dreamless sleep."
cryscr.43.a:0 "Fine."
cryscr.44.t:0 "The Mines"
cryscr.44.d:0 "The next morning you all eat a short breakfast, cooked by Sakira. After that, you decide to try your luck in the mines and search for something valuable. After looking around, you stumble upon a shaft covered by the remnants of a large wooden door. The look of the tunnel is not very inviting. In fact, it is downright creepy. There almost seems to be a....dead space around the shaft entrance, within which grass seems unable to grow. It feels like the whole place is an entrance to the underworld. "There's nothing we can do about it" says Lake, lighting his horn. "Don't hesitate, hesitation and doubt are a waste of time." He turns away and goes inside."
cryscr.44.a:0 "Here we go."
cryscr.45.t:0 "Old Gates"
cryscr.45.d:0 "The tunnel is very dark, and only the presence of unicorn magic and the flashlight on Dust's head allows you to continue on. Here and there, you see rusty remnants of pickaxes, shovels, and other equipment. This place clearly hasn't been touched since the disappearance of the Crystal Empire. Every tool looks medieval, ancient. There weren't any rails, like you've seen in pictures of mines in the San Palomino Desert. After a good hour of walking in cold, wet, stuffy air of the shaft, turning every now and then according to Lake's map, you stumble upon a door which was not marked on the map. "I can sense a magical barrier on this door" says Lake, tapping it experimentally with a hoof."
cryscr.45.a:0 "What's with that?"
cryscr.46.t:0 "The Barrier"
cryscr.46.d:0 ""I have break it somehow." says Lake, as his horn begins to glow brighter. The arcane aura of his magic concentrates around the door. Sparks start to appear, as if the door itself is a malfunctioning machine. Soon, the ground begins to shake and the ozone chocking the air makes it hard to breath. The rumble of this magical duel reverberates off the walls of this tight enclosed space, growing into a physically painful cacophony. Suddenly the door explodes in a cloud of light-grey dust. A fleck of debris hits you, and when you bring your hoof to your cheek it comes away red. Lake screams at the climax, and you rush over to his side."
cryscr.46.a:0 "Ah."
cryscr.47.t:0 "Treasures"
cryscr.47.d:0 "The door has vanished, atomised. Lake stands and rubs his forehead in pain, grimacing. Once the cloud of dust and residual magic static has faded, you are able to see what was behind the door. THOUSANDS of crystals of different kinds and shapes are in front of you! Umbrum crystals, gems, precious stones of every description. "This is great!" exclaims Dust. "Are you alright?" Sakira asks Lake. "Y-yes, it's okay, something just got in my eye when the door exploded." he replies.\nYou retrieve the crystals that you need to grow the Dark Heart and head back home."
cryscr.47.a:0 "Well, that went better than expected."
cryscr.48.t:0 "Crystal Dark Energy"
cryscr.48.d:0 "You decide to take your time and charge the crystals scattered around the City with dark magic. Lake and Dust teach you to control your magic power through a magical staff. "Remember, magic lives in all of us, in all ponies. Some of us just need certain help to control it." After several days of hard practice you learn a spell that takes part of your mana and transforms it into dark energy. With that, the group takes you to fill the crystals. As said in the books, it will create an additional layer of force to support the reincarnation spell."
cryscr.48.a:0 "Right."
cryscr.49.t:0 "The Dark Heart is ready"
cryscr.49.d:0 "At last, the Umbrum crystal has grown into the Dark Heart. With this, when the moment comes, we will replace the Crystal Heart and bring King Sombra back!

cryscr.49.a:0 "Yes."
cryscr.50.t:0 "Dark Portents in the Crystal Empire"
cryscr.50.d:0 "As Equestrian advisors have spread throughout the Empire they've started to notice strange events, prompting an investigation by the Royal Guard. Results were... inconclusive. It is a strange situation where the chief investigator, True "The Fox" Believer, swears that there is a conspiracy afoot, but no matter how many people are interrogated nor how many accounts audited nothing seems to appear. Some of the Crystal Royal Guard seem to believe the same as The Fox, with them proclaiming that this conspiracy must go all the way to the highest echelons of government, but many others on both sides of the border are now saying that this is starting to feel like a wild pony hunt. The Fox claims that the investigation must continue, and that he is close to unravelling the whole thing, but that is unlikely to be financially feasible."

Immediately, giant storm clouds appear in the sky, blocking out the moon. You and your friends stand in a circle around the heart and start chanting the spell. The crowd supports you.

Lightnings strikes, brighter than ever now, pepper the ground and illuminate the streets as if it were day time. Suddenly, everything turns black. Ghostly shadows are passing by. Explosions, thunder, the earth shakes... But after a minute the darkness fades away. And there he stands in a crater under the palace, in his steel armour, his eyes glowing with dark magic.

crysom.15.d:0 "Propaganda campaigns and military training, as well as funding to military factories, will all drain our scarce resources. But there's no way around it if we want to stay in power.

crysom.17.a:0 "Great!"
crysom.18.t:0 "Together in trouble"
crysom.18.d:0 "Over time Sakira was allowed to go outside. She never fell into despair about her condition, especially with you by her side. She never pitied herself and urged others not to. She took her sickness for granted, as if it was an ordinary way of life. You never left her alone during these bad days, nor did she abandon you. Together you knew you could get through this.

After the events in Stalliongrad and its successful separation from Equestria, the Crystal communists considered following the example of Stalliongrad and ending the status of their homeland as a puppet of the alicorn sisters. At the first congress of the newly formed Red Crystal Workers Party, one of the most important questions was the question of power. Some ponies thought that the route to power should be through elections to parliament, while others stood for more radical methods: preparing the revolution and destroying the monarchy. The two options had more or less equal support. Arctic Lily, the editor-in-chief of the largest communist newspaper "Red Snowflake", will have to choose which side she stands for."

The plea for freedom has remained in the mind of many Crystal Ponies since the nation's reemergence. They worry about their culture slowly withering away, and much of their industrial output being given to Equestria. Large scale protests have been occurring for days now, demanding a fair and unbiased referendum on the matter. Despite the vocal calls for change, little violence has occured, with the government taking no action or stance on the matter. Weeks turned into moons, and the ponies' fervour has diminished, as they have cynically accepted the fact that they will remain Equestria's vassal state, a step away from full annexation."

However, the most pressing matter is regarding our formal alliance with Equestria. There is no doubt that the Crystal Empire can stand on its own, but there are many dangers in this new world, far more threatening than Sombra, and the Crystal Princess has expressed that the alliance should be maintained. However, the dissenting opinion believes that the nation is more than capable of defending itself, and relying on [equestria.GetLeader]'s assistance would only result in continiued subjugation.

Though they will never be able to say it publicly, many crystal citizens hope that the new queen will be able to tame many of her husband's darker impulses. For many outside the Empire though the new queen is a mystery, save for the fact that she was the ringleader of the plot to bring Sombra back to life.

Her meteoric rise to fame and success is attributed to her resolve in spreading the magic of friendship wherever she went, and in the process corrected many wrongs and even converted some former antagonists to the Equestrian cause. She is also one of the most brilliant mages of the time, having invented and perfected many spells and arcane methods. Yet Twilight Sparkle remains as humble as the day she first set hoof in Ponyville, preferring the company of her friends and family rather than dealing with the minutiae of bureaucracy. \n\nRecent events, however, have left her greatly saddened, and she has accepted the rulership of the Crystal Empire.

Unfortunately, his marriage day was almost ruined by Queen Chrysalis' schemes, but through the power of love, he and Cadance expelled the changelings from Canterlot. Afterward, they were appointed rulers of the resurgent Crystal Empire, guarding it from the dark forces of King Sombra. He is stern, but fair, and the troops under his command greatly appreciate his father-figure behaviour and unwavering dedication to the defence of Equestria.

Although timid and introverted by nature, her fellow ponies encouraged her talent, resulting in Wondermane having a chance to attend a prestigious school in Baltimare. While her academic performance was not always stellar, Wondermane's natural drive and determination led her to discover her exceptional talent in combat magic. Soon afterwards, she was recommended to the newly formed Equestrian unicorn corps.\n\nEven with her pacifist tendencies, Wondermane has shown herself to be capable in the field. Eventually rising to the top of her command, she was one of the first military personnel to be assigned to the recently returned Crystal Empire. The frigid north suits Wondermane more than her native jungles ever had."

His thoughts are based around one thing. The continuous attack of a enemy line. He holds his troops to the highest. At the same time, he holds airpower as key to his plans, and uses it religiously.\n\nIce is a only child, and his family spent a lot of time around him. When it came to be known to them he wanted to become a chef, his father instead booked him, and persuaded him to enlist in the Royal Guard. His initial expectation was a short career, but he began to grow fond of the orderly construct of the military.\n\nDespite being a playful and friendly bat, he did his job efficiently. He was promoted to Sergeant at the age of 24, eventually applying, and accepted, into the Equestrian Military Academy. He entered it expecting to get his commission, until he actually entered it. The competition of the school thrilled him, and he was among the highest-scoring graduates. Following his comission as a 2nd Lieutenant, he was deployed to the Severyanan border, putting down small insurgents and equally small border skirmishes. His work was noticed eventually, and he was finally comissioned as a Captain when he was 33. His ascent into becoming a Lt.Col. began when he was tasked with the assault of a factory taken over by a small group of rebels. He led a group of 20 ponies against around 40 insurgents. After a two-hour siege, he convinced the insurgents to surrender, propelling him from Major to Lieutenant Colonel at the age of 35. He transferred to the Crystal Army afterwards, still using the insignia of his old unit, the 38th Winter Warfare Battalion."

Additionally, our units will be able to reorganize and conduct counterattacks easier due to frontline depots on the weaker, more spread out enemy forces.\n\nThe lands of our Crystal Empire are vast and empty. We can give part of them to the enemy and see how long he can survive in its harsh conditions."

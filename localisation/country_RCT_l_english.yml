 rivercity.2.t:0 "The Great of them all"
 rivercity.2.d:0 "The River Republika, second eldest of the democracies in the Riverlands and the real powerhouse behind the River Coalition has had a long and turblent history since the Death of Grand Princess Soft Water in 814. In her will she declared a Republican Institution based of the example in Lake City to rule for the will of the ponies instead of meddling monarchs with illusions of grandeur.\n\nThe River Republic still stands head held high now in 1007, The Coalition has grown to encompass many more regions and territories even their old adversary Wittenland stands with them united in the idea of a free east. However the Republic itself is questioning its own policies and agenda in the Riverland...""

 rivercity.3.t:0 "Negiotations with the Socalists"

 rivercity.3.a:0 "..."

 rivercity.8.t:0 "New Minister of the Treasury"
 rivercity.8.d:0 "With the Republika stable and the financial sector once again about to function, the vacancy in the office of the Minister of Treasury has grown too important to ignore. We must choose a new administrator to hold the position, however there are no notable candidates in the lower levels of the administration. Your Baba back in Zagrep has suggested you give the job to your Cousin, Pumpkin Swirl. This would be sure to be appreciated by your family, and it's not like there's many impressive candidates, but it may cause a stir if you begin promoting family to office."
 rivercity.8.a:0 "We shouldn't shake the boat..."
 rivercity.8.b:0 "I'm sure Cousin Pumpkin Swirl can do it."

Socialists want to doubledown and reform the Military industry from the groundup and expand it to provide 'adequate' protection from all potential foes. \n\nThe Economy \n1.) Republicans, including Chancellor Swirl, want to maintain the Free Trade Zone, who's realities have seen Rejeka retain an absolute monopoly on all business in the Republic \n2.) New Republicans want to cut existing regulations to promote job growth, and reduce corporate taxes. \n3.) Socialists want to increased regulations and government oversight on Businesses, and end the Free Trade Zone to allow foreign corporations to compete locally. \n\nNon-Pony Citizens and Workers \n1.)

 rivercity.12.t:0 "Of Politics and Platforms Part 2"
 rivercity.12.d:0 "\n\nSocial Services \n1.) Republicans, want to keep the status quo, with ponies being required to provide for their own health insurance, retirement funds. With minor goverment funding for emergency services. \n2.) New Republicans want to slash public social services and make private ponies hoof the bill. \n3.) Socialists, including Chancellor Swirl, want to completely take social services out of the hooves of private interests and make it all publicly available, but only to native-born Riverponies.  \n\nForeign Policy \n1.) Republicans, want to keep the status quo, including the economic alliance with rest of the Coalition \n2.) New Republicans, including Chancellor Swirl want to expand Rejeka's influence across the Coalition and open doors to allow further cooperation between the Riverponies. And possibly deal a final solution to the Knights of Hellquill problem. \n3.) Socialists want to maintain The Republics's policy of neutrality while keeping Coalition for economic and security. Some Radical members have hinted that they would actually like to see a unified Riverland for the benefit of all its ponies."

 rivercity.50.t:0 "New Minister of the Treasury"
 rivercity.50.d:0 "With the Republika stable and the financial sector once again about to function, the vacancy in the office of the Minister of Treasury has grown too important to ignore. We must choose a new administrator to hold the position, however there are no notable candidates in the lower levels of the administration. Your Baba back in Zagrep has suggested you give the job to your Cousin, Pumpkin Swirl. This would be sure to be appreciated by your family, and it's not like there's many impressive candidates, but it may cause a stir if you begin promoting family to office."
 rivercity.50.a:0 "We shouldn't shake the boat..."
 rivercity.50.b:0 "I'm sure Cousin Pumpkin Swirl can do it."

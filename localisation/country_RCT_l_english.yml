 #### EVENTS  ####
 rivercity.13.t:0 "The Poverty Issue"
 rivercity.13.d:0 "One of the bitterest and most acrimonious disputes between the Harmonist and Socialist parties is the issue of poverty. Thousands of mares and stallions live on barest subsistence, and it is extremely hard for any of the poor to find gainful employment. This stagnation has continued for several years now, and both sides blame each other for failing to act appropriately. The Harmonists, being the majority party, have proposed a bill that would increase investment in industry and infrastructure, arguing that this growth would create new jobs for the poor to take up and lift themselves out of poverty, while the Socialists are unconvinced, preferring the implementation of extensive social welfare programmes. Nova Whirl, leader of the Socialist opposition party, has condemnded the Harmonist plan, calling it the "Fat Cat Benefit Act", and has threatened to expel any Socialist that supports it from her party. If more than 90% of her party follows her line on this issue, then the Harmonists may fail to secure a big enough majority to pass the bill."

 rivercity.16.t:0 "The Rural/Urban Divide"
 rivercity.16.d:0 "The second issue to cause dissent in the parliament is the issue of rural versus urban concerns. The Harmonist party draws much of its support from the rural farming population, while the Socialists rely almost entirely on urbanites and factory workers for their votes. However, in recent years the farmers have begun to feel that even the Harmonists are not really their friends, as they have spent more and more time dealing with budgetary and economic concerns, and less time addressing the issues that matter to them. They complain of a lack of good infrastructure, making it hard to sell their crops, of the high cost of fertiliser, making farming less profitable than it could be, and especially of the lack of policing in remote rural areas. River Swirl absolutely cannot afford to lose the farmers' support, and so she has drafted a Rural Development Plan with a view to consolidating their loyalty to Harmony. The Socialists, understandably, are less enthusiastic about this plan. While they cannot scupper the Bill entirely, they are advising that it be amended substantially to spread its funding between urban and rural areas - a move that would benefit them, and only them. The only question that remains is whether or not they will be able to secure enough support from the less-loyal Harmonists to get what they want..."

 rivercity.19.d:0 "The third issue that has come before the Cabinet is an odd one. A group of urbanite, upper-middle class city ponies has left their dwellings in Rijekograd and taken up a primitive, agrarian mode of existence in the Talzar Hills. They have begun to forget that they are, in fact, part of our country, and ignore the central government's orders. They refuse to pay their taxes, refuse to respect police officers, and in general act as if they were a completely independent country. Things have come to a head, as a tax collector was attacked by the Talzarites when she tried to force them to comply with the law. This has led to fresh tensions in government. On the one hoof, this is a flagrant attack on a government official, and cannot be tolerated. On the other, the official was a tax collector, and most of the public is having a hard time mustering much sympathy for a tax collector. Still, there is a general consensus that *something* ought to be done about these play-pretend farmers. After much wrangling, it has been agreed that one more diplomatic envoy should be sent to tell them to buzz off, but both political parties have suggested their own candiates for the task. The Harmonists favor the hard-nosed marshal Hector Lipizzan, while Nova Whirl herself has offered to go as the Socialist representative."

 rivercity.22.d:0 "It is no secret that River Swirl and Nova Whirl hate each other, and constantly attempt to undermine each other's positions, but it was only today that their mutual disdain came fully to a head. At the climax of a particularly heated debate, Nova Whirl publicly proclaimed a motion of No Confidence in the Chancellor, and as if planned in advance, her entire party followed behind her. This puts River Swirl in an untenable position - she can no longer run a democratic government without at least the nominal confidence of the second largest party. If her own party was united, they might have been able to press on and simply ignore the Socialists, but the RHS is a loose coalition of conservatives, liberals, and mild socialists united only by their fear and mistrust of the SKR. Many of her own party members abstained from voting or even (shockingly) voted No Confidence also, leaving the Chancellor with few options. She will have to go back to the polls."

As both are well-known for hating each other and have intimate knowledge of each other's political foibles, this debate drew a huge crowd, expecting to see mud-slinging on an unprecedented scale - and they were not disappointed. Though the umpire tried to keep the debate on point, it quickly devolved into a shouting match about who was responsible for the government's inability to get anything done. Police eventually had to disperse the crowd and end the "debate" prematurely in order to prevent a riot from breaking out. Nonetheless, the crowd on that day was more impressed..."

As such, this debate was chaired by a representative chosen by the party leadership, rather than by the party heads themselves. On one side, the Harmonists were represented by Marshal Hector Lipizzan, while the Socialist Party elected Nova's second-in-command, Caramel Haze, to speak for them. This debate, though more orderly than the previous, was still filled with fiery oration, as Caramel Haze is a far more stringent Stallionist than Nova Whirl, while Hector is a stern anti-Communist. Thankfully, the animated rhetoric did not result in animated rioters, and at the end of the day, the crowd was most convinced by..."

 rivercity.26.d:0 "The RHS is a broad tent of political viewpoints, united only by their fear and hatred of Communism. As such, they rarely agree on anything, and River Swirl cannot even trust the majority of them to support her on hard issues most of the time. However, today, in a rare display of unity, the party has unanimously passed a resolution to provide the Chancellor with wide-ranging powers in the event of an "Emergency". Ostensibly meant to preserve the Republic's ability to fight wars and suppress rebellion without being crippled by obstructionist politicians, many note that the Bill leaves the definition of "Emergency" up entirely to the discretion of the Chancellor, and thus is a dangerous first step on the path to autocracy. Despite these concerns, the RHS has been so disgusted by recent Socialist attempt to paralyse our democracy that it has consented to allow this bill to be drawn up. The Bill was voted through by a rare united front of Harmonists, and now all that River Swirl needs to do is sign the Bill into law..."
 rivercity.26.a:0 "I must think this over for a while"
 rivercity.27.t:0 "Red Saturday"
 rivercity.27.d:0 "Though they were allies for as long the the Harmonists were in power, Nova Swirl has never seen eye to eye with her second-in-command, Caramel Haze. He was always too radical, too willing and ready to fight, too dismissive of stategy or common sense. He was a fanatic, assured that all that was needed for the Revolution to succeed was for Communists to fight for it with sufficient zeal. In fact, when Nova once asked him in exasperation whether he would prefer fighting the entire River Coalition alone to subverting the bourgeois democracy from within first, he immediately replied with a "Yes".\n It was for these reasons, among others, that the two have never gotten along that well. Today, that division has flared up in a dramatic way. Caramel Haze, as a high-ranking army general, has authority over many divisions, and it has come to the attention of Nova's spies that the divisions assigned to protect Rijekograd have slowly been rotated out over the last few weeks in favor of units nominally under Haze's control. This is a deeply worrying sign, for the two socialist leaders have recently argued in the parliament, and it seems that Caramel's patience has finally run out. All the evidence points to the early stages of a coup. Will Nova Swirl's spies report back in time?"

 BillSuccessTitle:0 "Industry, The Engine of Wealth"
 BillSuccessDesc:0 "Good news! Initial signs from the passing of the Industrial Incentive Bill are positive, as business owners and industrialists across the land are filled with confidence. Factories have begun to churn once more, and orders for raw materials have been sent out in record numbers in anticipation of brisker business. Already, new positions and openings have appeared in the labor market, and while these are few, the public have taken them as a sign that the Bill is working."
 BillSuccessButton:0 "Always trust the free market"
 BillFailTitle:0 "A Stimulus Failure"
 BillFailDesc:0 "Unfortunately, despite the passing of the Industrial Incentive Bill, very little has improved in the state of our economy. Of course, nopony expected the Bill to magically fix everything in a few weeks, but everyone expected at least some promising signs. Sadly, these signs have been lacking. Business leaders are not convinced that it will be enough, or are wary of being mired in the complicated tangle of laws that would be the result of accepting state funding. The common wisdom on the street is that the Bill is just another futile effort by a failing government."
 BillFailButton:0 "Dammit! Now the Socialists will be vindicated!"
 HarmonyBlamedTitle:0 "Public Blames The Government"
 CommBlamedTitle:0 "Public Lashes Out At The Socialists"
 HarmonyBlamedDesc:0 "Despite the fact that Nova Swirl's Socialists were responsible for the government's plan being killed, the public is not privy to everything that happens in the halls of power. As such, the Harmonist party are taking the blame for the government's inaction and seeming impotence in the face of the poverty crisis. Opinion polls show support for the government being corroded, as the people slowly begin to believe that they might just be useless after all."
 CommBlamedDesc:0 "In an explosive press conference, River Swirl has denounced the Socialists for their meddling and intransigence, blaming them for thwarting the government's attempts to save the economy. Though some consider this an excuse, many ponies are leery enough of the Socialists that they believed this, and now it seems that the Harmonists have successfully deflected the blame for the government's inaction onto the Socialist Party! The result has been a sharp, swift decline in popularity for Nova's party, threatening it with a gradual slide into irrelevance."

 MixedInvestmentFailedTitle:0 "Like Butter Over Too Much Bread"
 RuralInvestmentSuccessTitle:0 "The Faithful Farmers"
 RuralInvestmentFailureTitle:0 "Throwing Money To The Pigs"
 MixedInvestmentSuccessDesc:0 "As we predicted, the project of investing both in rural and urban areas has provided the most benefit for all. Some worried that there would not be enough money to ensure that anything significant got done in either area, but this turned out not to be a problem, thanks to excellent, scientific management principles. This has significantly eroded support for the Harmonists, and expanded our base among the farmers."
 MixedInvestmentFailedDesc:0 "Disaster! Our attempts to split funding efforts between rural and urban centres has divided our money in too many directions, and no single project has been a success - that is to say, the entire enterprise has been a failure. This debacle and waste of money has made us look like fools in both the cities and the countryside!"
 RuralInvestmentSuccessDesc:0 "Our investment efforts into the rural heartlands of our country have met with initial success! New roads allow farmers to transport goods to market much faster and more easily, an investment in fertilisers has raised crop yields overall, and increased police spending has led to a sharp drop in rural crime (an issue that particularly bothers those who have to live in remote areas). Overall, quality of life for the farmers seems set to improve - and they are extremely grateful to us for it."
 RuralInvestmentFailureDesc:0 "Sadly, our attempts to invest in rural infrastructure have met with failure. A mixture of bureacratic obstinance and lack of enthusiastic support by farmers has resulted in our efforts coming to nothing. Despite the large sums spent on this project, we have very little to show for it."
 MixedInvestmentSuccessButton:0 "Yet more proof of the superiority of scientific socialism"
 MixedInvestmentFailedButton:0 "It simply was not carried out properly!"
 RuralInvestmentSuccessButton:0 "The farmers have always been reliable"
 RuralInvestmentFailureButton:0 "Blast it! Nova Whirl will be laughing at us!"
 NovaSwirlConvincesTitle:0 "A Nova Of Emotion"
 NovaSwirlUnconvincingTitle:0 "An Embarassing Display"
 WildheartSuccessTitle:0 "Tough Love"
 WildheartFailureTitle:0 "The Talzar Terror"
 NovaSwirlConvincesDesc:0 "In a moving display, Nova Swirl has announced today the formal establishment of the Talzar Commune as an autonomous region of the River Republic. The Talzarites have, apparently, agreed to pay taxes and follow the laws of our country providing that we allow them to govern themselves. This decision, which Nova Swirl by no means had the right to make, has been seen as a direct attack on the legitimacy of River Swirl's government. Despite the outrageous overstepping of her own authority, the public as a whole seems to just be happy that the issue is dealt with, and nopony seems to be willing to go to the bother of overturning a solution that seems to be working. It seems as if the illegal decision must be allowed to stand."
 NovaSwirlUnconvincingDesc:0 "To Nova Whirl's dismay, the Talzarites were unwilling to listen to her proposal of autonomy within the Republic. They simply considered themselves 'citizens of the world', and not bound by the laws of a society they hadn't chosen to be born into. Nova Whirl's repeated attempts to convince them met with no more success, and while what happened next is not precisely clear, what is known is that Nova Whirl returned to Rijekograd in a wet, mud-soaked burlap sack. In light of her abject failure, Wildheart has taken matters into his own hooves and forcibly dispersed the Talzarites back to their own homes. The whole affair has been an embarassment to the Socialist cause, and has made the Harmonist government look altogether stronger or more competent than ever before."
 WildheartSuccessDesc:0 "Marshal Hector always had a reputation as a tough, no-nonsense commander who wouldn't take guff from anypony, even from the richest and most powerful families in the Republic. As such, when he and a hundred soldiers marched up the hills to the Talzarites and ordered them to cease squatting on land that they had no right to, they had to take notice. The professionalism of the soldiers was without peer, as not a single shot was fired, and not a single Talzarite was injured as they were frog-marched back to their houses. While some regard his methods as a little excessive, most ponies are just happy that Hector was able to slap some sense into these fools."
 WildheartFailureDesc:0 "Marshal Hector has always had a reputation as a tough-minded military commander - but perhaps his military methods aren't quite what was needed for an expedition such as this. The thick-headed, idealistic leader of the Talzar Commune immediately butted heads with Hector, and as neither was willing to back down, violence ensued. Accurate reports on what precisely transpired are impossible to come by, but what we do know is that the Talzarites fled the hills in terror, spreading stories of cruel violence. While nopony really liked the Talzarites, very few wanted to see them dead, and this display of excessive force has caused support for River Swirl to take a sharp hit. The Socialists, in particular, have turned Talzar almost into a rallying-cry, and are daily denouncing our government as illegitimate."
 NovaSwirlConvincesButton:0 "Comrade Nova Whirl's plans are executing precisely as planned"
 NovaSwirlUnconvincingButton:0 "They will pay for this when the Revolution comes!"
 WildheartSuccessButton:0 "Three cheers for the Marshal!"
 WildheartFailureButton:0 "Tensions are coming to a head..."
 HarmonicElectionDesc:0 "Despite the chaos of the past weeks, River Swirl's RHS party has secured a majority in the polls. The Socialists, having expended their political capital forcing this snap election, should no longer be able to interfere with River Swirl's policies, as she finally has a large enough majority that she can afford to ignore them."
 CommunistElectionDesc:0 "Nova Whirl's dangerous gambit has paid off - the electorate's ennui and dissatisfaction with the government has translated into a staggering victory for the SKR. Now that the bourgeois politicians have finally been ousted, the Socialists can commence their great work of perfecting society."
 HarmonicElectionButton:0 "I love democracy! I love the Republic!"
 CommunistElectionButton:0 "The People have finally stood up!"

 POLITICS_RIVERSWIRL_DESC:0 "River Swirl is a former teacher from Rijekograd who studied abroad in Celestia's School For Gifted Unicorns. She later entered politics and quickly rose through the ranks of the Rijeka Harmony Party. She was elected Chancellor of the River Republic in (INSERT YEAR) and her term was mostly successful, allowing her to win the elections for the second time. However, continued modernization has led to growing social issues in cities which have greatly increased the popularity of the left. Her second term is unlikely to be as unproblematic as the first."

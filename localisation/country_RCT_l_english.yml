 #### FOCUSES ####
 RCT_coalition_government:0 "Divided Government"
 RCT_coalition_government_desc:0 "The start of River Swirl's second term as Chancellor has not been an easy one. Runner-up Nova Whirl has gathered a strong left-wing coalition against River Swirl and her Rijeka Harmony Party. The two leaders and their parties have radically different ideas about policies, which might result in a political deadlock. Unless a solution is found the government may cease to function."

 RCT_strengthen_the_ohs:0 "Strengthen the OHS"
 RCT_strengthen_the_ohs_desc:0 "The Office of Harmonic Services has existed since Rijekograd's reformation into a republic and initally guarded the nascent democracy from monarchist conspirators. Over the decades their resources have been significantly reduced as they were seen as obsolete, but times are changing. We must be prepared to face threats from without and within."
 
 RCT_undermine_the_ohs:0 "Undermine the OHS"
 RCT_undermine_the_ohs_desc:0 "The Office of Harmonic Services is a vicious, dark tool of the bourgeois tyrants. Who knows what they did in the shadows to keep us in check? How many of our comrades "disappeared" thanks to them, never to be seen again? Too many, that is for certain. Now that we are in control of the government, we must defang the plotting fox."
 
 #Dab on the empire
 RCT_phoenix_programme:0 "The Phoenix Programme"
 RCT_phoenix_programme_desc:0 "At first we thought the death of Grover V would finally bring the collapse of the Empire. Alas, this did not happen and OHS agents report of a military buildup in the West. The Empire has attacked the Riverlands before and it may do so again. We must ensure the Griffon Phoenix does not become strong enough to rival our entire Coalition!"

 RCT_replace_the_unstable_government:0 "Replace the Unstable Government"
 RCT_replace_the_unstable_government_desc:0 "The Office of Harmonic Services has assessed the situation and found that the bickering between the parties in the Sabor is a clear and dangerous security risk. It is time to convince River Swirl that drastic measures must be taken to stabilise the government, lest we become too weak and divided to resist the Empire."
 
 RCT_secure_the_riverlands:0 "Secure The Riverlands"
 RCT_secure_the_riverlands_desc:0 "We cannot afford cracks in the River Coalition. Every country in the Riverlands that does not stand with us may provide an easy way for the Griffon Empire to corner us politically and militarily. The Coalition must stand together as a bulwark against griffonkind, but we cannot afford countries backing out. Even though it pains us, we must secure the Riverlands."
 
 RCT_progpganda_opperations:0 "Anti-Imperial Propaganda"
 RCT_progpganda_opperations_desc:0 "The OHS has managed to capture enough footage of griffon society that we can use to our advantage. Scheming griffon capitalists extorting their people, endless wars and dishonourable nobles... We will reinforce these stereotypes with a well-oiled propaganda machine, so that everypony knows who the true enemy is."

 RCT_war_harmony:0 "Wartime Harmony"
 RCT_war_harmony_desc:0 "The principles of harmony to which our government and people have clung to so hard, are not inherently wrong, but they are dangerous. In war, the values which you hold dear melt before your eyes. However, we will keep those ideas that are dearest to us even in these harsh times. Wartime Harmony may be different from who we aspire to be in the ideal world, but it doesn't change who we are at heart."

 RCT_crackdown_on_dissent:0 "Crackdown on Dissent"
 RCT_crackdown_on_dissent_desc:0 "Many ponies are questioning our rule. They clamour for a more peaceful course instead of steering our country towards what they perceive as a catastrophic and totally preventable conflict. In other times, we would value their criticism, but in these crucial years, we must make a unified front against the aggressive griffons. We will respond harshly to anti-government protests from now on."

 RCT_reconcile_nova:0 "Reconcile Nova Whirl"
 RCT_reconcile_nova_desc:0 "Although Nova Whirl is a socialist, she is not completely irredeemable. The mare still believes in harmony in her heart, but goes about achieving it differently than us. With some guarantees that our country will not go after communist groups, domestically and abroad, we might be able to convince Nova Whirl to support our cause."

 RCT_disappear_skr_leadership:0 "Arrange an Accident"
 RCT_disappear_skr_leadership_desc:0 "The OHS has been keeping tabs on the leadership of the socialist party. Many of them are growing increasingly dissatisfied with our government and might coordinate resistance against us if not handled carefully. It would be really fortunate if some of the socialist leaders were to have an accident..."

 RCT_the_southern_communists:0 "The Griffon Communists"
 RCT_the_southern_communists_desc:0 "To the south of the River Coalition, a new threat has been brewing. The griffon nobility has been treating their workers and peasants so badly that they have risen in revolt. Rather than embrace harmony, however, these birds have embraced communism. Their misguided ideals of global unity means they will seek to invade us sooner or later. We must strike first."

 RCT_OHS_divisions:0 "OHS Divisions"
 RCT_OHS_divisions_desc:0 "The Office of Harmonic Services will need to form special military units to keep the regular soldiers in check. These units will an example for our frontline units by showing their willingness to die for our harmonic cause. Of course, these units will be able to take over regular army units if they perform below expectations. "

 RCT_OHS_detachments:0 "OHS Detachments"
 RCT_OHS_detachments_desc:0 "The Office of Harmonic Services is an intelligence agency first and foremost and it should focus on that task. But, to advance the war effort, we can attach especially courageous and loyal agents to our divisions. These agents will oversee our soldiers and especially our officers, to ensure high morale and absolute conviction of our harmonic cause."

 RCT_recruitment_drive:0 "Recruitment Drive"
 RCT_recruitment_drive_desc:0 "The stream of new recruits is slowly drying up, but we will require many more soldiers to fight against the Empire! Luckily, propaganda is one of the OHS's strong points. Every street corner will have a poster. Veterans will go to colleges and workplaces to rally the stallions and the mares and the radio will remind every Rijekan to do their duty!"

 RCT_the_western_corridor:0 "The Western Corridor"
 RCT_the_western_corridor_desc:0 "The time has come to secure our path towards the empire. The knights of Hellquill and Longsword act as a bufferzone for the regime in Griffenheim, using rightful pony land to fortify themselves from our assault. We will liberate these suffering ponies and forge a path to Grover's doorstep."

 RCT_end_of_empire:0 "End the Empire"
 RCT_end_of_empire_desc:0 "The great task is almost at an end. Before us lie the vast lands of the Griffonian Empire. In it live millions of griffons who seek to destroy harmony and bring all ponykind into the grips of their iron claws. The River Republic will never let that happen!"
 
 RCT_jobs_done:0 "A Job Well Done"
 RCT_jobs_done_desc:0 "The OHS has done its duty to the River Republic and the entire harmonic world. The Griffonian Empire has been neutralised and with it, a great threat to global peace. None of this would be worth anything, however, if the agency didn't reinstate the elected government and retreated back into the background."

 RCT_neverending_emergency:0 "Never-ending Emergency"
 RCT_neverending_emergency_desc:0 "The Griffonian Empire may have been beaten, but many threats still loom large. The spectre of communism and the terror of supremacy still haunt the continent. To step back now would be a fatal mistake. The OHS will keep guarding the River Republic forevermore."

 #River Swirl's pillowfort, socialists and imperialists get out reee
 RCT_bastion_of_the_east:0 "Bastion of the East"
 RCT_bastion_of_the_east_desc:0 "Countless times have the Riverlands been attacked, and countless times have our enemies broken against our mountains like waves break against cliffs. The Riverlands must remain an unassailable bastion, and become a true safe haven of harmony and democracy."

 RCT_golden_curtain:0 "The Golden Curtain"
 RCT_golden_curtain_desc:0 "We must ensure that the Empire does not directly threaten the borders of the Coalition. A Golden Curtain needs to be raised around us: A sphere of influence consisting of allies and friends that will safeguard us from foreign invasion."
 
 RCT_establish_the_minutemares:0 "Establish the Minutemares"
 RCT_establish_the_minutemares_desc:0 "The Griffonian Empire may strike at neighbouring democratic nations at any moment. We need to do all we can to prevent their expansion at the expense of liberty and harmony! New militia units of volunteers will be organized, ready to respond to threats abroad quickly, hence the name."
 
 RCT_operation_cherry_party:0 "Operation: Cherry Party"
 RCT_operation_cherry_party_desc:0 "A buffer zone needs to be created in the Evi valley to guard the Coalition's southwestern border. For too long have Lake City and Wittenland suffered from griffon raids! Lushi, Gryphia and Gryphus should all embrace democratic, liberal and pacifistic government, lest they threaten us or become the Empire's pawns." 
 
 RCT_intervene_in_brodfeld:0 "Intervene In Prywhen"
 RCT_intervene_in_brodfeld_desc:0 "The kingdom of Brodfeld has long been a concern to us, since they suffered from a devastating famine and instability which led to King Kloseu assuming autocratic powers. The situation has only worsened after a bloody civil war. We must bring peace and freedom to the griffons of Prywhen who have suffered long enough!"
 
 RCT_operation_magic_star:0 "Operation: Magic Star"
 RCT_operation_magic_star_desc:0 "Hellquill and Longsword, both creations of the Empire, have been rivals of the entire Coalition for centuries. They are responsible for countless raids and crimes, such as the sacking of Diamond Mountain and the burning of Lake City. It is time the barbaric knights abandon their violent ways, embrace harmony and align with the East instead of the West."
 
 RCT_friendship_without_borders:0 "Friendship Without Borders"
 RCT_friendship_without_borders_desc:0 "As our Golden Curtain expands, liberty and democracy are brought to numerous lands and millions finally enjoy lives of freedom and harmony. The new governments we have set up are in debt to us and are willing to pay with military aid. Let the Empire and their armies come! They will learn to respect the true power of friendship."
 
 RCT_the_final_battle:0 "The Final Battle"
 RCT_the_final_battle_desc:0 "OHS agents report of a massive military buildup in the Empire. It is clear they are preparing to strike at us with full force! We cannot allow the imperialist scum to have the initiative, but must go on the offensive, despite it going against our morals and values. Desperate times call for desperate measures."
 
 # Friendship is magic
 RCT_ready_the_storm:0 "Prepare For The Storm"
 RCT_ready_the_storm_desc:0 "A storm is brewing in the West, but for now peace reigns in the East. While we can, we must strengthen our bonds with other Coalition members and ensure the alliance is strong enough to withstand any tempest."
 
 RCT_river_games:0 "The River Games"
 RCT_river_games_desc:0 "Riverlands Cup is already an established tradition and has brought us all closer together. Indeed, few things can make people bond as well as sports do. Therefore we should organize a new grand event with a variety of different sports, allowing each member to excel in something even if hoofball isn't their cup of tea."
 
 RCT_scholarship_programme:0 "River Scholarship Programme"
 RCT_scholarship_programme_desc:0 "The Riverlands are home to many brilliant minds who live in different countries, yet their talents are unrecognized. We should conduct an academic scholarship competition open to all students and reward the highest-achieving competitors with generous scholarships. This will allow us to find the most capable students and support them financially."
 
 RCT_united_joint_river_works:0 "United Construction Regulation"
 RCT_united_joint_river_works_desc:0 "Currently all member nations have their own laws and traditions when it comes to building. This makes cooperation rather difficult. Construction practices should be regulated and harmonized so no matter where the workers are from, they can work together on large projects."

 RCT_agricultural_standerds_authority:0 "Agricultural Standards Authority"
 RCT_agricultural_standerds_authority_desc:0 "As trade of agricultural products between members of the Coalition grows, so does the risk of disease that could ruin crops and kill animals. Tariffs imposed on trade are also rather hefty and farming practices -- and thus production efficiency -- vary greatly. Establishing international regulations and standards will resolve all these issues."
 
 RCT_equestrian_exchange:0 "Equestrian Exchange"
 RCT_equestrian_exchange_desc:0 "Equestria is the most advanced nation of ponies in the world. They do not jealously guard their great knowledge, so all we need to do is ask them and we will surely receive scientific aid. If they desire, we can give them our studies as well and cooperate together to create a brighter tomorrow."
 
 RCT_social_security_act:0 "Social Security Act"
 RCT_social_security_act_desc:0 "The rise of the SKR was partially caused by the poor conditions of our ponies. Indeed, the socialists were right: we need to aid the less fortunate in our society and ensure everyone gets a chance in life. An extensive and modern social security law must be passed to aid the elderly, the foals and the unemployed."
 
 RCT_healthcare_reform:0 "Healthcare Reform"
 RCT_healthcare_reform_desc:0 "There is more we can do to improve the lives of our ponies: A healthcare reform that improves both quality and availability of medical aid. Public insurances will be made afforable with slightly higher taxes and free vaccination programs will be started at once."
 
 RCT_equestria_of_the_east:0 "Equestria Of The East"
 RCT_equestria_of_the_east_desc:0 "River Swirl has followed Celestia's hoofsteps and is molding the River Republic after the greatest pony nation in the world. Life expectancy, average income and happiness are all rising rapidly, and soon enough the lives of our ponies will be as good as the lives of Equestrian citizens. Our nation will now show the way for other Coalition members just like Equestria showed the way for us."
 
 
 
 RCT_the_dog_question:0 "The Dog Question"
 RCT_the_dog_question_desc:0 "Diamond Mountain is unfortunately a disgrace for the entire Coalition. Their government does not ensure the complete liberty of their people, neither does it advocate for peace and harmony. Quite the opposite. This is something we should not -- and will not -- tolerate. "
 
 RCT_watertowns_friendship_group:0 "Harmony in Watertowns"
 RCT_watertowns_friendship_group_desc:0 "The villages far in the north have banded together in the Watertowns. Although many see their pacifist communal society as socialist, it is clear they are harmonists in denial. By sending delegations to the Watertowns to talk to the ponies there, we might be able to convince them that we have much in common."
 
 RCT_border_defence_fund:0 "Border Defence Fund"
 RCT_border_defence_fund_desc:0 "We will ask everypony to contribute to the border defence fund. Half made up of private donations and half of government funds cobbled together from whatever we had left, this fund will help us acquire the resources needed to make state of the art fortifications along our borders."
 
 RCT_war_readiness_act:0 "Ensure War Readiness"
 RCT_war_readiness_act_desc:0 "Our population must be trained for wartime emergencies. Instructions to find safe shelters and how to put on gas masks. Training to turn off lights and be mindful about gossip and the food you consume. When everypony is ready, any war we encounter will be over before we know it!"
 
 RCT_seek_equestrian_support:0 "Seek Equestrian Aid"
 RCT_seek_equestrian_support_desc:0 "War has broken out, but the River Republic is not the sole defender of harmony in the world. A wise and kind princess rules over our western cousins in Equestria. River Swirl still has some connections there from when she studied overseas. Perhaps the Equestrians will aid our war effort?"
 
 RCT_the_home_act:0 "The Home Act"
 RCT_the_home_act_desc:0 "The Home Act will serve as a reminder about what we are fighting for: The homeland of the Rijekan people. Freedom, harmony and democracy! The River Republic is our home and we will stand together to defend it from anypony who would harm it!"
 
 
 
 RCT_arms_provisioning:0 "Emergency Arms Provisioning"
 RCT_arms_provisioning_desc:0 "A massive military buildup will be necessary if the River Republic is to compete with the enemies of harmony. We will enact emergency protocols to confiscate useful factories and tools. With these assets, we will make our military industry much more capable."
 
 RCT_establish_uhac:0 "Establish The UHAC"
 RCT_establish_uhac_desc:0 "The Un-Harmonic Activities Committee will make sure that everypony, especially government workers, do not let themselves in with unharmonic views. Especially pro-griffon sentiment and socialism must be rooted out. These ponies are cunning and hide in plain sight, so we must be relentless in chasing them down and stopping them."
 
 RCT_reform_the_disharmonists:0 "Reform The Unharmonious"
 RCT_reform_the_disharmonists_desc:0 "Nopony is forever lost to harmony. With patience and good examples, we can reform anypony to accept the ways of freedom and democracy. A caring heart and a silver tongue will convince even the most ardent socialists of our righteous cause!"
 
 RCT_citizinship_reform_act:0 "Citizenship Reform Act"
 RCT_citizinship_reform_act_desc:0 "It is clear that we cannot just give out citizenship to our great Republic to everypony. A true citizen takes responsibility for society and is willing to fight for it. Those who have seen the battlefield, will work in harmony to make the world peaceful. Military service will be a requirement for citizenship."

 RCT_office_of_scientific_development:0 "Office of Scientific Development"
 RCT_office_of_scientific_development_desc:0 "Scientific progress is a crucial part of a peaceful society, but it is even more important for warfare. We will need to pool our resources by making a special office that gathers the right scientists for the right job. We will always be ahead of our enemies if we outsmart them!"

 RCT_show_trials:0 "Co-Opt The OHS"
 RCT_show_trials_desc:0 "The Office of Harmonic Services can still be of use to us. We shall reform it into the Committee for State Security and change it from a cruel torture device of the bourgeoisie into a just guillotine of the proletariat!"
 
 RCT_military_industrial_complex:0 "Defence Industry Complex"
 RCT_military_industrial_complex_desc:0 "Our military production is unsatisfactory. The new Ministry of Defence Industry will ensure quotas are increased and work discipline tightened. We must also construct new assembly plants where our free proletariat will work day and night."

 RCT_collectivised_agriculture_desc:0 "It is time we exterminate the disgusting concept of private ownership from our country. We will put our earth ponies to work on collective farms, at gunpoint if necessary, and destroy any fences dividing farms. Excessively wealthy peasants cannot be trusted and will be eliminated as a class."
 
 RCT_more_collectivisation:0 "Eradicate Unemployment"
 RCT_more_collectivisation_desc:0 "Comrade Caramel is dissappointed with the relatively high unemployment rate. How can we call ourselves a workers' state if we do not provide jobs for our people? With wage setting we can ensure labour will be cheap, allowing us to rapidly reduce unemployment to zero. Production is expected to increase substantially."
 
 RCT_mobilise_labor:0 "Establish Military Commissariats"
 RCT_mobilise_labor_desc:0 "We must do everything we can to ensure our liberated country does not fall. We shall found a new agency whose responsibilities will be mobilization planning, soldier drafting and training. Every young citizen will be required to report to the local commissariat for assessment for military service."
 
 RCT_industrialise_everything:0 "Mass Industrialisation"
 RCT_industrialise_everything_desc:0 "Comrade Caramel's mass industrialisation program needs to be implemented at once!

 RCT_market_socialism:0 "The Principles Of Market Socialism"
 RCT_market_socialism_desc:0 "No one can deny the benefits of having a market economy. It drives development and growth better than anything else. However, individuals are prone to exploit it to their own advantage. By gradually abolishing private ownership and introducing cooperatives and syndicates, every worker will be an owner who will receive their fair share of the profits."
 
 RCT_agrarian_coops:0 "Establish Agrarian Cooperatives"
 RCT_agrarian_coops_desc:0 "We must not neglect rural regions, despite them being more conservative and opposed to our values.

 RCT_economic_autarky:0 "Economic Autarky Plan"
 RCT_economic_autarky_desc:0 "We are surrounded by anti-communists on all sides. We must prepare for a worst-case scenario where they close their borders and make trade impossible.

 RCT_urbanise_coltstream:0 "Urbanise Wild-Vodina"
 RCT_urbanise_coltstream_desc:0 "Coltstream has great potential of becoming a sister city of Rijekograd. Wild-Vodina is largely a rural state, so we should use subsidies to attract local farmers to move into the town and become factory workers. This way we will kill two griffons with one stone: Wild-Vodina will urbanize and Coltstream will grow into a proper city."
 
 RCT_urbanise_coltonia:0 "Urbanise Coltonia"
 RCT_urbanise_coltonia_desc:0 "Coltonia is another largely rural state, but it has two relatively large cities, Zagrep and Virmanevitica. Investing in eastern Rijeka and subsidizing new industrial cooperatives will ensure the cities grow even larger."

 RCT_KGB_misinformation_desc:0 "To ensure our operations remain undiscovered, we must confound the lawkeepers, soldiers and agents of foreign countries.

 RCT_industry_infrastructur:0 "Invest In Infrastructure"
 RCT_industry_infrastructur_desc:0 "Riverlands are very mountainous, which makes roads expensive to build. Nevertheless, the importance of transport infrastructure cannot be overstated. Our national companies shall begin work immediately and connect our major cities and towns."

Our mines already produce a great amount of ore and we found several rich deposits in our survey, but our steel mills are a bottleneck. They must be expanded at once!

 RCT_river_games_military_desc:0 "A large military exercise where all members of the River Coalition participate will not only strengthen our bonds, but will also give our ponies some much needed practice so that they are prepared for the real fight."
 
 RCT_unicorn:0 "Fund Unicorn Training Camps"
 RCT_unicorn_desc:0 "Unicorns can turn the tide with their magic and many battles have been won thanks to them. We should fund more training camps for unicorns so they are capable to support the army even more than they already do."
 
 RCT_pegasus:0 "Fund Pegasus Flight Camps"
 RCT_pegasus_desc:0 "While we are physically weaker than griffons, our pegasi have proven time and time again that they can fight evenly in the air, and what they lack in strength they make up in speed. Funding more flight camps will ensure our pegasi have the upper hoof in aerial combat."
 
 RCT_ask_allies:0 "Aid From Allies"
 RCT_ask_allies_desc:0 "Our friends in the Coalition have their own army traditions and modernization programs. We should ask them about their art of war and exchange our knowledge. This way we not only find out what they are doing, but also learn new strategies, tactics and training methods."
 
 RCT_art_stuff:0 "Death From Afar"

 RCT_mobile:0 "Modern Transports"
 RCT_mobile_desc:0 "Thanks to combustion engines our soldiers no longer need to pull wagons on their own. These new vehicles are also fast and can traverse all kinds of terrain, only getting stuck in mud. Part of our military budget should be dedicated to increasing the use of trucks in the River Army."
 
 RCT_tanks:0 "Armoured Fighting Vehicle"
 RCT_tanks_desc:0 "There is a new innovation that is used on the battlefield in the west, the so called "tank", that has a great amount of potential. With armoured vehicles it is easy to strike at the enemy swiftly and break through defences that otherwise would be impenetrable. We should immediately begin researching these "tanks"."
 
 RCT_doctrain_2:0 "Better Doctrines for the Army"
 RCT_doctrain_2_desc:0 "Our military doctrines are slowly becoming outdated and there are many new innovations in warfare that we do not yet understand. Sending observers abroad to study the most modern militaries should allow us to reform our doctrines."
 
 RCT_mobile2:0 "Combined Arms"
 RCT_mobile2_desc:0 "What our research showed us was clear: tanks and motorized infantry go hoof to hoof. The two must be combined into a single unit, but that is not all. We also have to make sure that we have the newest models out there, as what good do combined arms do if the arms are outdated?"
 
 RCT_staff_start:0 "Capable Officers"
 RCT_staff_start_desc:0 "A good commander can lead a dozen sheep to victory against an army of wolves. We must ensure we have enough officers and that they are well-trained to fight a modern war."
 
 RCT_defensive_staff:0 "Defensive Chief of Army"
 RCT_defensive_staff_desc:0 "The most senior officer of the River Army must have a defensive mindset. The Riverlands have many natural defenses, such as rivers, mountains and forests, and it would be foolish not to utilize them."
 
 RCT_offensive_staff:0 "Offensive Chief of Army"
 RCT_offensive_staff_desc:0 "The River Army's leader should not foolishly rely solely on our defences, but must remain active for modern warfare is offensive and mobile warfare. We cannot allow our enemy to prepare attacks in peace, but harass them and break their lines."
 
 RCT_special_ops:0 "Special Forces Battalion"
 RCT_special_ops_desc:0 "We need to establish a unit dedicated to fulfilling special missions, during both war and peace. They will receive extensive, even dangerous training and be given our finest equipment to ensure they are the best of the best. All are invited, few are chosen."

 RCT_expand_officer_academy_desc:0 "If we wish to expand our army, we need to expand our officer training as well. The Coltovac Military Academy shall receive more funding from us, more student applications will be approved and more officers will be sent to teach the cadets."
 
 RCT_promote_best:0 "Promote the Best"
 RCT_promote_best_desc:0 "Some of our new cadets have proven to be very promising.

We are lacking talented senior officers, and this will solve the issue."
 
 RCT_light_infantry_training:0 "Light Infantry Training"
 RCT_light_infantry_training_desc:0 "While modern warfare has greatly reduced the old distinctions between heavy and light infantry, we can still train some of our units to be specialized light divisions.

 RCT_more_marines:0 "River Marines"
 RCT_more_marines_desc:0 "Riverlands has -- as the name implies -- numerous rivers. They form an obstacle to many units, but not to marines who are specialized in amphibious assault and excel in crossing rivers with ease. Without a doubt, our army should include well-trained marine units."
 
 RCT_expand_air:0 "Look to the Skies"
 RCT_expand_air_desc:0 "Modern warfare will be about the skies as much as the land. Planes are not impeded by rough terrain or the many rivers that flow through our land. But before we can expand our air force, we will need to build proper airbases and an aircraft factory."
 
 RCT_bombers:0 "Riverland Bombers"
 RCT_bombers_desc:0 "We will focus on procuring new designs for a bomber aircraft. Tactical bombers combine the speed and agility of close air support with some of their strategic destructive potential of their larger brethren. Such a versatile plane will be a safe pick for the backbone of our airforce."
 
 RCT_fighters:0 "Riverland Interceptors"
 RCT_fighters_desc:0 "When the griffons will inevitably strike our nation, they will seek to fill the skies with their malevolent bombers. To counter this, we must develop a state of the art interceptor, capable of scrambling quickly to take out these threats to innocent pony lives. Our air force will be built around a core of interceptors and fighters."
 
 RCT_cas:0 "The Skydiver Corps"
 RCT_cas_desc:0 "We will train a group of fearless ponies to pilot a corps of special bombers. These close air support ponies will dive from great height to surprise and destroy enemy troop concentrations. Disrupting enemy supply chains and staging grounds will surely destroy the morale of our opponents. Of course we still have to actually build a plane capable of this..."
 
 RCT_strat_doctrine:0 "River Rains Doctrine"
 RCT_strat_doctrine_desc:0 "We will bring the Riverland rains to the enemy! But they will find that it isn't water that falls from the sky, but a flood of bombs.

 RCT_fighter_doctrine:0 "Aerial Wave Doctrine"
 RCT_fighter_doctrine_desc:0 "To protect our dear homeland, we must make sure that no opponent makes it through to our country, both in the air and on the land. Waves of small fighters will protect us from enemy bombers and waves of close air support will mow down any catbird foolish enough to set their claws down in our land."
 
 RCT_long_range_planes:0 "Beyond the River"
 RCT_long_range_planes_desc:0 "To properly protect our country, we must venture forth beyond our home to meet our enemy head on. Bigger engines, better aerodynamics and larger fuel tanks will be needed to create the designs we need for the task. Let's let the designponies loose to see what they come up with."
 
 RCT_expand_air_defense:0 "From the Ground Up"
 RCT_expand_air_defense_desc:0 "Airplanes are expensive marvels of technology. The cost of bringing a gun into the air is much larger than the cost of having a larger gun on the ground. Fixed anti-air emplacements and ground based, towed anti-aircraft guns are an economical choice to protect our troops from enemy air raids."
 
 RCT_expand_radar:0 "Radio Detection"
 RCT_expand_radar_desc:0 "Our lands are vast and our planes can only patrol so much of our airspace. By using radar stations, we will multiply the effectiveness of our fighters, by making sure that our planes are in the right place at the right time!"
 
 RCT_expand_air_production:0 "Fill the Skies!"
 RCT_expand_air_production_desc:0 "The fighters and bombers that we chose to be the backbone of our air force, need to be produced in greater numbers. The air war is a game of numbers and when it comes down to it, the country with the largest air force will rule the sky. With an optimised production process, we will make sure that we will not be out produced."
 
 RCT_form_navy:0 "Mouth of the River"
 RCT_form_navy_desc:0 "We have secured a coast for ourselves, but without a proper navy, we will not be able to capitalise on this strategic opportunity. It is time to invest in our new coastal holdings to stimulate the construction of dockyards."
 
 RCT_destroyer_start:0 "Starting Small"
 RCT_destroyer_start_desc:0 "We are new to the way of the waves, so let us not overcomplicate matters. A destroyer is the smallest military ship type and we should be able to start production relatively easily and get ourselves the beginnings of a fleet."

 RCT_battleship_doctrine:0 "Fleet in Making"

 RCT_super_battleship:0 "Project Oversize"
 RCT_super_battleship_desc:0 "We will endeavour to produce the biggest, most heavily armed battleships that could ever sail the ocean. Huge siege guns, massive engines and impenetrable armour will make it so that our monster ship will flatten anything standing in its way. Our foes will shake in fear when this giant approaches!"
 
 RCT_carriers:0 "A Seaborne Air Force"
 RCT_carriers_desc:0 "Although seafaring is still new to us, we are more accustomed to the idea of an air force. Luckily, new breakthroughs in naval warfare have seen the rise of the aircraft carrier, a ship that acts as a mobile air base. The firepower of these planes ensure that this ship can strike beyond the range of any ship's guns and be a formidable threat to any fleet."
 
 RCT_carrier_doctrine:0 "Strike from the Sky!"
 RCT_carrier_doctrine_desc:0 "We will build our naval doctrine around these carriers. Our carrier planes will swarm the skies, while our fleet lies in wait, protecting our floating airbases.

 rivercity.3.t:0 "The Fate of the Unstable Government"
 rivercity.3.d:0 "After a series of secret meetings, an alliance of leading politicians, government employees, army officers and top business ponies have agreed that decisive action must be taken to ensure that the events that plagued the last election never happen again. There cannot be true harmony until all inharmonious elements in society have been purged or reformed. With the ever-present threat of communists, fascists, anarchists and griffons looming over the Republic, it was agreed that a temporary government lead by the Office of Harmonic Services should take power until such a time as true harmony has been achieved.\n\nRiver Swirl, horrified by such an idea, threatened to block such action which would be entirely legal under the emergency powers she had enacted. The alliance has been left with little choice than to seize power, a move that would look like a coup to the rest of the world, or to find a way to control the chancellor. Either way, it has been agreed that Director Arclight of the OHS would be the new leader of the interim government."
 rivercity.3.a:0 "Arclight seizes full control of the government."
 rivercity.3.b:0 "The OHS was able to 'convince' River Swirl to agree with the move."
 
 rivercity.8.t:0 "New Undersecretary of the Treasury"
 rivercity.8.d:0 "With the Republic stable and the financial sector once again about to function, the vacancy in the office of the Undersecretary of Treasury has grown too important to ignore. We must choose a new administrator to hold the position, however there are no notable candidates in the lower levels of the administration. Your Baba back in Zagrep has suggested you give the job to your Cousin, Pumpkin Swirl. This would be sure to be appreciated by your family, and it's not like there's many impressive candidates, but it may cause a stir if you begin promoting family to office."
 rivercity.8.a:0 "We shouldn't shake the boat..."
 rivercity.8.b:0 "I'm sure Cousin Pumpkin Swirl can do it."

 rivercity.9.t:0 "Pumpkin Swirl's Performance"
 rivercity.9.d:0 "River Swirl had her doubts about appointing cousin Pumpkin to the important position in the treasury. She never seemed really interested in the finances and her diploma from the local economy university was more of a blank paper than any measure of skill. River knew that cousin Pumpkin had little ambitions in her life and was more concerned with enjoying life with her friends. After all, she only got the job because Baba would never stop nagging her about ignoring her family.\n\nThankfully her decision was not made in vain. Reports have trickled in about Pumpkin's increasingly enhanced performance. It wasn't anything spectacular by any measure, but it was decent. Better than her predecessor, in any case. There were far less political attacks compared to the first few weeks, which River had a hard time rebuffing. It didn't take a griffon master of mathematics to tell you that nepotism is frowned upon, even if it's technically legal.\n\nYes, Pumpkin Swirl has done a great job. River decided it would be appropriate to invite her out for a nice family dinner. She knew her favourite, as well."
 rivercity.9.a:0 "I knew you could do it, cousin Pumpkin."

 ## CABINET ISSUE 1 - POVERTY 
 rivercity.13.t:0 "The Poverty Issue"
 rivercity.13.d:0 "One of the bitterest and most acrimonious disputes between the Harmonist and Socialist parties is the issue of poverty. Thousands of mares and stallions live on barest subsistence, and it is extremely hard for any of the poor to find gainful employment. This stagnation has continued for several years now, and both sides blame each other for failing to act appropriately. The Harmonists, being the majority party, have proposed a bill that would increase investment in industry and infrastructure, arguing that this growth would create new jobs for the poor to take up and lift themselves out of poverty, while the Socialists are unconvinced, preferring the implementation of extensive social welfare programmes. Nova Whirl, leader of the Socialist opposition party, has condemnded the Harmonist plan, calling it the "Fat Cat Benefit Act", and has threatened to expel any Socialist that supports it from her party. If more than 90% of her party follows her line on this issue, then the Harmonists may fail to secure a big enough majority to pass the bill."
 rivercity.13.a:0 "The Bill finds sufficient bipartisan support."

Factories have begun to churn once more, and orders for raw materials have been sent out in record numbers in anticipation of brisker business.

Of course, nopony expected the Bill to magically fix everything in a few weeks, but everyone expected at least some promising signs. Sadly, these signs have been lacking. Business leaders are not convinced that it will be enough, or are wary of being mired in the complicated tangle of laws that would be the result of accepting state funding.

The result has been a sharp, swift decline in popularity for Nova's party, threatening it with a gradual slide into irrelevance."

 ## CABINET ISSUE 2 - Rural Investment
 rivercity.16.t:0 "The Rural/Urban Divide"
 rivercity.16.d:0 "The second issue to cause dissent in the parliament, the Sabor, is the issue of rural versus urban concerns. The Harmonist party draws much of its support from the rural farming population, while the Socialists rely almost entirely on urbanites and factory workers for their votes. However, in recent years the farmers have begun to feel that even the Harmonists are not really their friends, as they have spent more and more time dealing with budgetary and economic concerns, and less time addressing the issues that matter to them. They complain of a lack of good infrastructure, making it hard to sell their crops, of the high cost of fertiliser, making farming less profitable than it could be, and especially of the lack of policing in remote rural areas. River Swirl absolutely cannot afford to lose the farmers' support, and so she has drafted a Rural Development Plan with a view to consolidating their loyalty to Harmony. The Socialists, understandably, are less enthusiastic about this plan. While they cannot scupper the Bill entirely, they are advising that it be amended substantially to spread its funding between urban and rural areas - a move that would benefit them, and only them. The only question that remains is whether or not they will be able to secure enough support from the less-loyal Harmonists to get what they want..."

This has significantly eroded support for the Harmonists, and expanded our base among the farmers."
 MixedInvestmentSuccessButton:0 "Yet more proof of the superiority of scientific socialism."

 MixedInvestmentFailedTitle:0 "Like Butter Over Too Much Bread"
 MixedInvestmentFailedDesc:0 "Disaster! Our attempts to split funding efforts between rural and urban centres has divided our money in too many directions, and no single project has been a success - that is to say, the entire enterprise has been a failure. This debacle and waste of money has made us look like fools in both the cities and the countryside!"

 ## CABINET ISSUE 3 - Talzar Commune
 rivercity.19.t:0 "The Talzar Commune"
 rivercity.19.d:0 "The third issue that has come before the Cabinet is an odd one. A group of urbanite, upper-middle class city ponies has left their dwellings in Rijekograd and taken up a primitive, agrarian mode of existence in the Talzar Hills, located in the state of Coltonia. They have begun to forget that they are, in fact, part of our country, and ignore the central government's orders. They refuse to pay their taxes, refuse to respect police officers, and in general act as if they were a completely independent country. Things have come to a head, as a tax collector was attacked by the Talzarites when she tried to force them to comply with the law. This has led to fresh tensions in government. On the one hoof, this is a flagrant attack on a government official, and cannot be tolerated. On the other, the official was a tax collector, and most of the public is having a hard time mustering much sympathy for a tax collector. Still, there is a general consensus that *something* ought to be done about these play-pretend farmers. After much wrangling, it has been agreed that one more diplomatic envoy should be sent to tell them to buzz off, but both political parties have suggested their own candiates for the task. The Harmonists favor the hard-nosed marshal Hector Lipizzan, while Nova Whirl herself has offered to go as the Socialist representative."

 WildheartSuccessTitle:0 "Tough Love"
 WildheartSuccessDesc:0 "Marshal Hector always had a reputation as a tough, no-nonsense commander who wouldn't take guff from anypony, even from the richest and most powerful families in the Republic. As such, when he and a hundred soldiers marched up the hills to the Talzarites and ordered them to cease squatting on land that they had no right to, they had to take notice. The professionalism of the soldiers was without peer, as not a single shot was fired, and not a single Talzarite was injured as they were frog-marched back to their houses. While some regard his methods as a little excessive, most ponies are just happy that Hector was able to slap some sense into these fools."
 WildheartSuccessButton:0 "Three cheers for the Marshal!"

 WildheartFailureTitle:0 "The Talzar Terror"
 WildheartFailureDesc:0 "Marshal Hector has always had a reputation as a tough-minded military commander - but perhaps his military methods aren't quite what was needed for an expedition such as this. The thick-headed, idealistic leader of the Talzar Commune immediately butted heads with Hector, and as neither was willing to back down, violence ensued. Accurate reports on what precisely transpired are impossible to come by, but what we do know is that the Talzarites fled the hills in terror, spreading stories of cruel violence. While nopony really liked the Talzarites, very few wanted to see them dead, and this display of excessive force has caused support for River Swirl to take a sharp hit. The Socialists, in particular, have turned Talzar almost into a rallying-cry, and are daily denouncing our government as illegitimate."

The Talzarites have, apparently, agreed to pay taxes and follow the laws of our country providing that we allow them to govern themselves. This decision, which Nova Whirl by no means had the right to make, has been seen as a direct attack on the legitimacy of River Swirl's government. Despite the outrageous overstepping of her own authority, the public as a whole seems to just be happy that the issue is dealt with, and nopony seems to be willing to go to the bother of overturning a solution that seems to be working. It seems as if the illegal decision must be allowed to stand."
 NovaSwirlConvincesButton:0 "Comrade Nova Whirl's plans are executing precisely as planned"
 
 NovaSwirlUnconvincingTitle:0 "An Embarassing Display"
 NovaSwirlUnconvincingDesc:0 "To Nova Whirl's dismay, the Talzarites were unwilling to listen to her proposal of autonomy within the Republic. They simply considered themselves 'citizens of the world', and not bound by the laws of a society they hadn't chosen to be born into. Nova Whirl's repeated attempts to convince them met with no more success, and while what happened next is not precisely clear, what is known is that Nova Whirl returned to Rijekograd in a wet, mud-soaked burlap sack. In light of her abject failure, Hector has taken matters into his own hooves and forcibly dispersed the Talzarites back to their own homes. The whole affair has been an embarrassment to the Socialist cause, and has made the Harmonist government look altogether stronger or more competent than ever before."

 ### Failure of Government ###
 rivercity.22.t:0 "Nova Makes Her Move"
 rivercity.22.d:0 "It is no secret that River Swirl and Nova Whirl hate each other, and constantly attempt to undermine each other's positions, but it was only today that their mutual disdain came fully to a head. At the climax of a particularly heated debate, Nova Whirl publicly proclaimed a motion of No Confidence in the Chancellor, and as if planned in advance, her entire party followed behind her. This puts River Swirl in an untenable position - she can no longer run a democratic government without at least the nominal confidence of the second largest party. If her own party was united, they might have been able to press on and simply ignore the Socialists, but the HSR is a loose coalition of conservatives, liberals, and social democrats united only by their fear and mistrust of the SKR. Many of her own party members abstained from voting or even (shockingly) voted No Confidence also, leaving the Chancellor with few options. She will have to go back to the polls."

Though the umpire tried to keep the debate on point, it quickly devolved into a shouting match about who was responsible for the government's inability to get anything done.

As such, this debate was chaired by a representative chosen by the party leadership, rather than by the party heads themselves. On one side, the Harmonists were represented by Marshal Hector Lipizzan, while the Socialist Party elected Nova's second-in-command, Caramel Haze, to speak for them. This debate, though more orderly than the previous, was still filled with fiery oration, as Caramel Haze is a far more stringent Stallionist than Nova Whirl, while Hector is a stern anti-Communist. Thankfully, the animated rhetoric did not result in animated rioters, and at the end of the day, the crowd was most convinced by..."

However, today, in a rare display of unity, the party has unanimously passed a resolution to provide the Chancellor with wide-ranging powers in the event of an "Emergency". Ostensibly meant to preserve the Republic's ability to fight wars and suppress rebellion without being crippled by obstructionist politicians, many note that the Bill leaves the definition of "Emergency" up entirely to the discretion of the Chancellor, and thus is a dangerous first step on the path to autocracy. Despite these concerns, the HSR has been so disgusted by the recent Socialist attempt to paralyse our democracy that it has consented to allow this bill to be drawn up. The Bill was voted through by a rare united front of Harmonists, and now all that River Swirl needs to do is sign the Bill into law..."

 rivercity.27.d:0 "Though they were allies for as long the Harmonists were in power, Nova Whirl has never seen eye to eye with her second-in-command, Caramel Haze. He was always too radical, too willing and ready to fight, too dismissive of stategy or common sense. He was a fanatic, assured that all that was needed for the Revolution to succeed was for Communists to fight for it with sufficient zeal. In fact, when Nova once asked him in exasperation whether he would prefer fighting the entire River Coalition alone to subverting the bourgeois democracy from within first, he immediately replied with a "Yes".\nIt was for these reasons, among others, that the two have never gotten along that well. Today, that division has flared up in a dramatic way. Caramel Haze, as a high-ranking army general, has authority over many divisions, and it has come to the attention of Nova's spies that the divisions assigned to protect Rijekograd have slowly been rotated out over the last few weeks in favor of units nominally under Haze's control. This is a deeply worrying sign, for the two socialist leaders have recently argued in the Sabor, and it seems that Caramel's patience has finally run out. All the evidence points to the early stages of a coup. Will Nova Whirl's spies report back in time?"

 rivercity.1923.d:0 "When [From.GetName] noticed that after recent additions to the treaties and regulations that make up the River Coalition, support for socialism gradually increased, they sent out a commission of bureaucrats and investigators to find out what was causing the changing attitudes amongst their populace. After a thorough investigation, they discovered that the River Republic had snuck in changes to the treaty of Coltstream. These directives went unnoticed by our diplomats and were hidden in the middle of a list of insignificant changes in an already massive mountain of paperwork. The additions`, made by the Rijekan chief representative at the last minute, seemed harmless at first sight, so that [From.GetAdjective] bureaucrats just followed directives without question as they were unable to see the bigger picture. However, the investigators found out that these innocently worded changes were in fact vehicles to increase socialist support throughout the Riverlands.\n\nIn a public press conference, [From.GetAdjective] officials named the culprit; Nova Whirl's River Republic. The announcement was followed by angry reactions from most countries in the Riverlands, who accused the Rijekans of abusing their trust. Soon after, Nova Whirl sent a letter of apology, promising that they will not intervene with other members' affairs again."

Churning through the heaps of paperwork that make up such a directive, they even found the exact changes that were responsible. The minutes of the meeting of diplomats show that these changes were made at the last minute, deep at night. Interviews show that every representative and staff member was eager to get to bed and none of them remember exactly who made the change. Vague memories from attending staff and incomplete minutes mean that we may never find who is responsible for spreading socialism through our nation."

 rivercity.1925.d:0 "[From.GetName] had called an emergency meeting of the leaders of the River Federation in [From.Capital.GetName]. Grim faced, [From.GetLeader] explained that the current situation left their government no choice but to activate an emergency protocol in the Treaty of Coltstream to expel countries that used subterfuge to try and topple a member state government.\n\n[From.GetLeader] had a long list of wrongdoings committed by the ostensibly peaceful Rijekan government. Most of them came down to Nova Whirl's socialist government influencing the people of the Riverlands through secret changes in the treaties made between the River Coalition members. Of course Nova Whirl apologised again, blaming overzealous subordinates and bureaucratic errors. However, [From.GetLeader] was clearly done with Nova Whirl's apologies and pushed through the emergency vote. It is now up to every leader of the coalition to cast a vote to either expel [RCT.GetName] or leave them in the coalition. The fate of the Rijekans would be decided by a majority vote."

Reactionaries, monarchs and capitalists who oppressed the workers of the Riverlands have all been defeated. Now that our neighbours have embraced the way of progress, we are free to build a socialist future for all. However, many things still remain to be done if our nation is to become a shining beacon for the world to follow. In a speech broadcast to all corners of the Riverlands, [Getleader] laid out the plans for the future. Culture, economy and military would all be integrated, to ensure optimal cooperation between the Riverland people. We have come a long way, but the road ahead is longer still."

Strikes and protests have been ever more frequent as our friends cling to their backward traditions. However, the problems seem to be so severe that local governments may be unable to handle the outbreaks of nationalist sentiment. The central government must intervene. We can choose to give concessions to the strikers, but risk losing the progress we have made, or we can send in the army to enforce cultural unity."

The Nimbusian hoplite, the Monks from Pònaidhean and the army of Lake City were an integral part of their countries' cultures, but their time has come. However, it has proven to be a huge undertaking to mould all these martial traditions into our own Union Army. Soldiers and officers from multiple provinces refuse our instructions, training their ancient doctrines or in some cases, refuse to train at all until the central government promises to preserve their military tradition. Do we concede to the soldiers' demand, or do we whip them into shape?"

 rivercity.1930.t:0 "Resistance To Economic Reorganisation"
 rivercity.1930.d:0 "The road to a socialist economy is long and arduous. Some clans in the highlands of Pònaidhean still used bartering, while the dogs of Diamond Mountain have a hard time to build a slave-free economy. The abolishment of private property and sometimes moves against slavery and serfdom have led to a lack of some goods the people have grown accustomed to. This has led to complaints from our local governments, who say that they cannot explain to their citizens that socialism is not yet providing for everypony, unlike what the propaganda claims. We could give local governments some leeway to introduce some temporary privatisation to relieve the pressure, but doing so will set back our progress. Alternatively, we could use central government resources to support local collectivisation efforts and provide the most basic needs."

The vast and rugged Riverlands provide excellent staging grounds for these organisations who operate in the shadows. When we close down an illegal printing press in one place, an armoury gets raided for guns somewhere else. We seem to be making little headway in uprooting the counterrevolutionary threat. In fact, some bureaucrats in the capital are suggestion that we stop our efforts and negotiate with these groups, so that we can stop the unrest. Of course that would cause us to lose all progress we did make."

At first they merely complained, then they protested, then they rioted. Each time, the police and armed forces urged them to to peacefully dissipate, and strife was avoided. However, after a radical Caramelite soldier attempted to assassinate Marshal Hector, something changed. Hector, galvanised by this brush with death, redoubled his efforts to unite the reactionaries, and they have attached to him like iron filings to an electromagnet. Today, in a broadcast heard widely throughout the countryside, he proclaimed the Socialist government illegitimate, and called on all patriotic riverponies to rally behind his flag, for the restoration of Rijekan Democracy."

OHS agents reported that he was building up support in the towns and cities, but their reports came too late and they were unable to stop him. Caramel's soldiers have now seized control of several towns and a new socialist government has been formed with Caramel Haze as its leader.

Behind him, an ancient passageway - a Royal Passageway - creaked up, and ponies stormed out, waving rifles. King Rover bared his teeth in a snarl, and then began to smirk, before bursting out laughing. "Well done, my daughter! A slave uprising and then a raid on my very hall. And under my very nose!"\n\nMolly frowned in confusion "Father... I'm sorry... but things need to change around here. The slaving, the cruelty, must stop. This is not strength, this is cowardice! True strength as a leader comes from cooperation and prosperity, not oppression and conflict!"\n\nRover held up his paw - "Enough. You have proven your strength. Diamond Mountain is your to rule as you wish." he reached up, removing his crown, tossing it to the ground.\n\nPrincess Molly stared. Her father was not the dog she thought he was. And now Diamond Mountain was hers."

 rivercity.305.d_com:0 "Our soldiers raced down the passageway as if possessed. The revolution was in danger! Their efforts were rewarded as they found Princess Molly accompanied by several armed ponies struggling with a door into the royal chambers, catching them off guard. Guns were raised to fire, but she turned, raising her claws "We surrender".\n\nThe soldiers fired anyway.\n\nThe next day, Clifford the Red stood before the masses of Diamond Mountain.\n\n"Yesterday we were betrayed - the ponies of the River Republic, always speaking of peace and cooperation, attempted to end the revolution! The Capitalists cannot be trusted. If they wish to destroy us, we will be only too happy to return the favour. All prior relationships with the River Coalition and River Republic are ended. Diamond Mountain stands alone! And they should hide in their halls, for we are coming for them!"\n\nHowls echoes through the halls."
 rivercity.305.d_fas:0 "Princess Molly raised a shaking paw to the door. On either side, Rijekan Special Forces held their rifles ready. She would open this door, arrest her father, and become the new leader of Diamond Mountain. The Office of Harmonic services would get the sympathetic leader they wanted. And she... would betray her father.\n\nShe began to tremble, all over. This wasn't right. She couldn't do this - not to Rover!\n\nShe turned to the soldiers "Stop. We're not doing this. I'll get you out of here... but this mission? We're not doing it"\n\nOne of the soldiers cursed. They knew without Molly, everything they had done would be useless.\n\nIt was at that moment that the doors flung open, and King Rover charged through, bowling over Molly and the entire team of ponies. Royal Guards followed in. Rover surveyed the scene.\n\n"MY DAUGHTER LEADING A COUP ATTEMPT?!" He began to laugh. "You'll need to do better than that to beat your old father! You, young lady, are grounded for a year!" He turned to the soldiers "And you, River Republic scum, flee back to your masters before I rip you limb from limb, and tell them the Diamond Dogs do not forget those who betray them!""

 # Watertowns stuff
 
 rivercity.307.t:0 "A Visitor From The South"
 rivercity.307.d:0 "A most unusual thing happened today - while on her daily rounds around the Village, Eathelin was approached by a pony wearing strange clothes. He wore an overcoat of dark green, with three squiggly blue lines on it, looking for all the world like rivers. Of course, Eathelin was happy to help him, and the two started to talk. It transpired that he was an ambassador from some place called 'Rijekograd', and was looking for the leader of Watertowns. He seemed skeptical when Eathelin told him that she was the closest thing there was to a leader here, but eventually he was persuaded. While she didn't really understand most of the things he said, he was clearly friendly, and it turned out that he wanted to build a house of his own here, so that he could come meet us more regularly. Of course, he needed permission to build a house on our own land, and since Eathelin was the leader, it seemed that was her decision to make."
 rivercity.307.a:0 "Sure, you can build here!"
 rivercity.307.b:0 "Sorry, but strangers can't build houses here."
 
 rivercity.308.t:0 "The Cold Shoulder"
 rivercity.308.d:0 "Our envoy to Watertowns arrived back home today. To our disappointment, the ponies of Watertowns were resistant to our proposal. Despite their friendly nature, they evidently still have a deep mistrust of outsiders and strangers."
 rivercity.308.a:0 "Darn those rubes."
 
 rivercity.309.t:0 "Our Mutual Friend"
 rivercity.309.d:0 "Some months ago, Eathelin was visited by a friendly stranger from the south, and gave him permission to build a house of his own there. While he went home again shortly afterwards, the house was always kept clean and ready for him - it doesn't do to neglect your neighbours, after all. Today our diligence paid off, as he returned, and better yet, with friends! This time, they came bringing beautiful gifts - fine steel tools, rare plants and perfumes, and exquisite woven clothes, far beyond our own skill to make. Of course, the people were ecstatic! Suddenly, the strangers were the toast of the town, and everypony wanted to hear what they had to say. Again, most of it went over our heads, but we gathered that they had some sort of news to tell us - something about a new way of life, but sometimes they claimed it was the same as our old way of life? Nopony was really sure - it was terribly confusing. Still, it's hard to dislike someone who bears rich gifts, and when they left, the people cheered. But an uneasy feeling starts to rise in Eathelin's chest..."
 rivercity.309.a:0 "I'm sure it's nothing."
 
 rivercity.310.t:0 "The Gift-Bringers Return"
 rivercity.310.d:0 "Excellent news! Our friendship team has successfully returned from Watertowns, having lavishly dispensed the gifts we sent them to disperse. The Watertown ponies are starting to really open up to us, even though reports suggest they still don't quite understand the idea of Harmony as we understand it yet."
 rivercity.310.a:0 "They're coming around, though!"
 
 rivercity.311.t:0 "Strange Talk"
 rivercity.311.d:0 "The strangers from the South have returned again, and everypony was eager to meet them, and receive their wondrous gifts again. However, while there were indeed gifts, this time, they spent more time talking than before, and they worked harder to try and convince us of what they were saying. Sometimes they even withheld gifts from those who wouldn't agree with what they said. Whether out of genuine agreement with their "Harmonic" philosophy or a simple desire to snag goodies, quite a lot of ponies ended up publicly agreeing with the foreigners. After all, what they say, while kind of weird, does sound pretty compatible with what we already believe."
 rivercity.311.a:0 "They talk weird, but I guess they're OK!"
 
 rivercity.312.t:0 "They're Coming Around"
 rivercity.312.d:0 "We've received another update from our friendship troopers in Watertowns. Their latest excursion was a little more controversial than before, but they also got a lot more ponies to talk, think, and agree about the ideas of Harmony, and how it really isn't that different from what they already believe. It seems that they're really coming over - it should just take a little more pushing before they're willing to align properly with us."
 rivercity.312.a:0 "Soon, very soon."
 
 rivercity.313.t:0 "We're Harmony, You're Harmony"
 rivercity.313.d:0 "Those ponies from the South have returned again, but this time, there were even more of them. They have won a great number of converts to their way of thinking, many of which aren't even motivated by a desire for gifts anymore. Slowly, gradually, it seems that the ponies of Watertowns have come to think that we really have been a Harmonic people all along, and that our way of thinking about the world is really the same as that of this "Rijekograd" that the foreigners come from. More and more ponies have become interested in this place outside of our knowledge. So, today, when the leader of the foreigners came to Eathelin, asking for Watertowns to join with Rijekograd in friendship, she felt that she had little choice but to accept. Though she isn't completely sure about all of this, it seems like the people want it, so it has to be the right thing to do, right?"
 rivercity.313.a:0 "We should always be agreeable - that's my philosophy!"
 
 rivercity.314.t:0 "At Last"
 rivercity.314.d:0 "Finally, after months of persuasion, the ponies of Watertowns have accepted the fact that they are really Harmonists after all. They have signed a treaty of friendship with us, and pledge to be our friends forevermore!"
 rivercity.314.a:0 "Another friend made!"
 
 ###315 and 316 were cut for time reasons and because they simply weren't important enough
 
 rivercity.317.t:0 "An Opening"
 rivercity.317.d:0 "Success! The friendship delegate we sent to the strange ponies of Watertowns has made a good first impression. While he didn't really have a chance to discuss ideology in any detail, he wowed and impressed the simple tribesfolk with fabulous (to them) gifts. The leader of Watertowns has allowed our delegate to build a house of his own in their little community, whether or not he plans on staying there permanently - something that will prove a useful staging ground for the next phase of the operation."
 rivercity.317.a:0 "I can already feel we're going to be the best of friends."

 rivercity.321.a:0 "If not for pride, we could have asked decades ago!"
 
 rivercity.322.t:0 "Equestria Refuses"
 rivercity.322.d:0 "Citing the difficulties of cooperating over long distances, and the long history of unchecked violence and abuse of technology in Griffonia, Equestria have refused to cooperate or support our research efforts."

Because of this, they are the Riverlands' authority on aircraft. Studying with their experts should yield results useful for both of us."

 CaramelProclamation:0 "It is time to abolish the River Coalition, the despicable alliance of capitalist scum all united in oppression of their workers. This shall be Comrade Caramel's final reform: a new Union in place of the old alliance, with a constitution that embeds socialist values in every single member state. If the reactionary pigs are wise, they will bend and accept this turn of events!"
 NovaProclamation:0 "It is time for Nova Whirl to fulfill her last dream and unite the Riverlands under a single red banner of socialism and solidarity. The River Coalition will be reformed and all current members will be formally asked to sign the new Treaty of Rijekograd, which establishes socialist values as the foundation of a new Union."

 #### Politics ####
 POLITICS_RIVERSWIRL_DESC:0 "River Swirl is a former teacher from Rijekograd who studied abroad in Celestia's School For Gifted Unicorns. She later entered politics and quickly rose through the ranks of the Rijeka Harmony Party. She was elected Chancellor of the River Republic in 1001 and her term was mostly successful, allowing her to win the elections for the second time. However, continued modernization has led to growing social issues in cities which in turn has greatly increased the popularity of the left. Her second term is unlikely to be as unproblematic as the first."
 POLITICS_NOVAWHIRL_DESC:0 "Nova Whirl is a rising star in the political scene of the River Republic, having entered it only in 1004. She grew in the factory district of Rijekograd, where conditions were far from ideal, which influenced her political values greatly. Soon enough she joined a socialist youth club where she discussed the Stalliongrad revolution with others and eventually developed her own ideology: A mixture of market socialism, gradualism and internationalism. She finally entered politics to turn her socialist dreams into a reality."
 POLITICS_CARAMELHAZE_DESC:0 "Some consider him a bold hero of the revolution, others a dangerous tyrannical lunatic. To say the least, Caramel Haze is a controversial figure. He joined the ranks of the army at a young age, being attracted by wages which were above those of common labourers. At this time, he cared little for politics, but meeting a Bakaran economic advisor called Bray Foam would give his life new purpose. Caramel read the writings of his namesake, Caramel Marks, and then learned of Steel Stallion and his more radical principles. Soon he was filled with revolutionary fervour and joined the SKR, rising through the ranks rapidly.\n\nWhile Nova Whirl never trusted him, she realized his usefulness and so the two cooperated closely. But Caramel was not fond of Whirl either, thinking she was a revisionist and a social fascist. Ever since he has patiently waited for the time to seize control of SKR from her."
 
 lewd_dane_nerd:0 "A bit of an oddball in the military, Arcane's talent doesn't actually lie in military matters, rather, it lies in technology and magic.\n\nHe originally joined the Army as an engineer, before climbing the ranks through supply and logistics. Pioneering a computerized system for keeping track of both divisions and armies, he has since taken the offer to lead in a more direct role, rather than the behind-the-curtains role he occupied until now."

 GEAR_TAIL_DESC:0 "§YBio:§! Supportive of equipping of the army with technology, Gear, like his sister, was a small industrialist, following socialist workers' movements.\n\nGood knowledge of military equipment and weapons led him into the army, where he could better understand what kind of equipment is needed by the soldiers. All while the worker support and contacts Twotail Tail had helped to promote his ideas and set up effective production.\n\n§YPortrait By:§! Twotail813"
 TWOTAIL_TAIL_DESC:0 "§YBio:§! The necessary connections helped Twotail Tail rise through the service ladder.  Like her brother, she was a small industrialist supporting socialist workers' movements.\n\nWhile Gear created and improved new designs of arms, Two led the propaganda of socialist ideas in military circles, and provided communication and support of politicians and industry.\n\n§YPortrait By:§!

 RCT_melee_equipment_1_short:0 "River Arquebuses"

 RCT_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Era of Rifles are fading. With the quiet armaments program being set in place, ostensibly as a 'stimulus effort', HorSe has been given a large budget in this year's money bill to develop a new standard rifle for the Army of the Republic to phase out the mish-mash of random, personal, antiquitated hoof-me-downs that we are currently arming our soldiers with."

 RCT_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "As the International 'Volunteers' travelled to Longsword to take part, they brought with them their VHS1 rifles. While they served them well in the Battle of Haarsingnen and the Battle of Varéna, they lacked the ability to uphold a constant fire while on the move. HorSe reacted to these complaints by the General Staff by using the VHS1 as a base to develop the first domestic submachine gun kit in the VHS2"

 RCT_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "As Equestria came under siege, and the Riverlands Technology Exchange was increasingly used to evacuate technology valuable to Equestria to avoid it falling into Changeling hooves, part of the price was allowing the Republic access to the technology.

 RCT_infantry_equipment_x_desc:0 "As the Griffonian Empire became an increasingly large threat and was claiming griffon-inhabited lands within the River Federation, the VHS3-1 was rushed into service to alleviate fears of a Griffonian invasion through Longsword. Despite many initial problems, including the tendency for the magazine to jam at the most unfortunate of times, the lack of claws on Federal soil meant that this was only a problem for conscripts in training. When the issues were finally fixed, it would stay a steady hoof in war."

To alleviate this, even as some VHS2s were still being phased out in favor of the VHS3-1, captured Imperial weapons were studied and some of their innovations, most notably a new, more resilient firing pin would be paired with a domestic design to create the VHS4"

In comparison to the VHS1, their complaint was not as much rate of fire, as it was a lack of flexibility to fire more spells.

 RCT_brilliant_specter_desc:0 "Born moments after his twin sister Brilliant Shade, Brilliant Specter was raised in Rijekograd. His childhood was fairly unremarkable, with the colt taking to the books and learning through the magic of words and images about the world, and improving on his illusion magic in the process as well. Stories of Equestria with its immortal Princess inspired him to pursue a career in the military, hoping to make a positive impact on the River Republic's standing in east Griffonia. An ardent supporter of Harmony, he will do all that he can to defend his homeland."

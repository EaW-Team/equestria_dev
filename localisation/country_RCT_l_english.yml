 RCT_coalition_government:0 "Divided Government"
 RCT_coalition_government_desc:0 "The start of River Swirl's second term as Chancellor has not been an easy one. Runner-up Nova Whirl has gathered a strong left-wing coalition against River Swirl and her Rijeka Harmony Party. The two leaders and their parties have radically different ideas about policies, which might result in a political deadlock. Unless a solution is found the government may cease to function."

 RCT_strengthen_the_ohs:0 "Strengthen the OHS"
 RCT_strengthen_the_ohs_desc:0 "The Office of Harmonic Services has existed since Rijekograd's reformation into a republic and initally guarded the nascent democracy from monarchist conspirators. Over the decades their resources have been significantly reduced as they were seen as obsolete, but times are changing. We must be prepared to face threats from without and within."
 
 RCT_undermine_the_ohs:0 "Undermine the OHS"
 RCT_undermine_the_ohs_desc:0 "The Office of Harmonic Services is a vicious, dark tool of the bourgeois tyrants. Who knows what they did in the shadows to keep us in check? How many of our comrades "disappeared" thanks to them, never to be seen again? Too many, that is for certain. Now that we are in control of the government, we must defang the plotting fox."

 RCT_golden_curtain:0 "The Golden Curtain"
 RCT_golden_curtain_desc:0 "We must ensure that the Empire does not directly threaten the borders of the Coalition. A Golden Curtain needs to be raised around us: A sphere of influence consisting of allies and friends that will safeguard us from foreign invasion."
 
 RCT_establish_the_minutemares:0 "Establish the Minutemares"
 RCT_establish_the_minutemares_desc:0 "The Griffonian Empire may strike at neighbouring democratic nations at any moment. We need to do all we can to prevent their expansion at the expense of liberty and harmony! New militia units of volunteers will be organized, ready to respond to threats abroad quickly, hence the name."
 
 RCT_operation_cherry_party:0 "Operation: Cherry Party"
 RCT_operation_cherry_party_desc:0 "A buffer zone needs to be created in the Evi valley to guard the Coalition's southwestern border. For too long have Lake City and Wittenland suffered from griffon raids! Lushi, Gryphia and Gryphus should all embrace democratic, liberal and pacifistic government, lest they threaten us or become the Empire's pawns." 
 
 RCT_intervene_in_brodfeld:0 "Intervene In Prywhen"
 RCT_intervene_in_brodfeld_desc:0 "The kingdom of Brodfeld has long been a concern to us, since they suffered from a devastating famine and instability which led to King Kloseu assuming autocratic powers. The situation has only worsened after a bloody civil war. We must bring peace and freedom to the griffons of Prywhen who have suffered long enough!"
 
 RCT_operation_magic_star:0 "Operation: Magic Star"
 RCT_operation_magic_star_desc:0 "Hellquill and Longsword, both creations of the Empire, have been rivals of the entire Coalition for centuries. They are responsible for countless raids and crimes, such as the sacking of Diamond Mountain and the burning of Lake City. It is time the barbaric knights abandon their violent ways, embrace harmony and align with the East instead of the West."
 
 RCT_friendship_without_borders:0 "Friendship Without Borders"
 RCT_friendship_without_borders_desc:0 "As our Golden Curtain expands, liberty and democracy are brought to numerous lands and millions finally enjoy lives of freedom and harmony.

 RCT_the_final_battle:0 "The Final Battle"
 RCT_the_final_battle_desc:0 "OHS agents report of a massive military buildup in the Empire. It is clear they are preparing to strike at us with full force!

 RCT_river_games:0 "The River Games"
 RCT_river_games_desc:0 "Riverlands Cup is already an established tradition and has brought us all closer together. Indeed, few things can make people bond as well as sports do. Therefore we should organize a new grand event with a variety of different sports, allowing each member to excel in something even if hoofball isn't their cup of tea."
 
 RCT_scholarship_programme:0 "River Scholarship Programme"
 RCT_scholarship_programme_desc:0 "The Riverlands are home to many brilliant minds who live in different countries, yet their talents are unrecognized. We should conduct an academic scholarship competition open to all students and reward the highest-achieving competitors with generous scholarships. This will allow us to find the most capable students and support them financially."
 
 RCT_united_joint_river_works:0 "United Construction Regulation"
 RCT_united_joint_river_works_desc:0 "Currently all member nations have their own laws and traditions when it comes to building. This makes cooperation rather difficult. Construction practices should be regulated and harmonized so no matter where the workers are from, they can work together on large projects."

 RCT_agricultural_standerds_authority:0 "Agricultural Standards Authority"
 RCT_agricultural_standerds_authority_desc:0 "As trade of agricultural products between members of the Coalition grows, so does the risk of disease that could ruin crops and kill animals. Tariffs imposed on trade are also rather hefty and farming practices -- and thus production efficiency -- vary greatly. Establishing international regulations and standards will resolve all these issues."
 
 RCT_equestrian_exchange:0 "Equestrian Exchange"
 RCT_equestrian_exchange_desc:0 "Equestria is the most advanced nation of ponies in the world. They do not jealously guard their great knowledge, so all we need to do is ask them and we will surely receive scientific aid. If they desire, we can give them our studies as well and cooperate together to create a brighter tomorrow."
 
 RCT_social_security_act:0 "Social Security Act"
 RCT_social_security_act_desc:0 "The rise of the SKR was partially caused by the poor conditions of our ponies. Indeed, the socialists were right: we need to aid the less fortunate in our society and ensure everyone gets a chance in life. An extensive and modern social security law must be passed to aid the elderly, the foals and the unemployed."
 
 RCT_healthcare_reform:0 "Healthcare Reform"
 RCT_healthcare_reform_desc:0 "There is more we can do to improve the lives of our ponies: A healthcare reform that improves both quality and availability of medical aid. Public insurances will be made afforable with slightly higher taxes and free vaccination programs will be started at once."
 
 RCT_equestria_of_the_east:0 "Equestria Of The East"
 RCT_equestria_of_the_east_desc:0 "River Swirl has followed Celestia's hoofsteps and is molding the River Republic after the greatest pony nation in the world. Life expectancy, average income and happiness are all rising rapidly, and soon enough the lives of our ponies will be as good as the lives of Equestrian citizens. Our nation will now show the way for other Coalition members just like Equestria showed the way for us."
 
 
 
 RCT_the_dog_question:0 "The Dog Question"
 RCT_the_dog_question_desc:0 "Diamond Mountain is unfortunately a disgrace for the entire Coalition.

 RCT_the_commissars:0 "Political Commissars"

 RCT_show_trials:0 "Co-Opt The OHS"

 RCT_military_industrial_complex:0 "Defence Industry Complex"
 RCT_military_industrial_complex_desc:0 "Our military production is unsatisfactory. The new Ministry of Defence Industry will ensure quotas are increased and work discipline tightened. We must also construct new assembly plants where our free proletariat will work day and night."
 
 RCT_collectivised_agriculture:0 "Collective Farming"
 RCT_collectivised_agriculture_desc:0 "It is time we exterminate the disgusting concept of private ownership from our country. We will put our earth ponies to work on collective farms, at gunpoint if necessary, and destroy any fences dividing farms. Excessively wealthy peasants cannot be trusted and will be eliminated as a class."
 
 RCT_more_collectivisation:0 "Eradicate Unemployment"
 RCT_more_collectivisation_desc:0 "Comrade Caramel is dissappointed with the relatively high unemployment rate. How can we call ourselves a workers' state if we do not provide jobs for our people? With wage setting we can ensure labour will be cheap, allowing us to rapidly reduce unemployment to zero. Production is expected to increase substantially."
 
 RCT_mobilise_labor:0 "Establish Military Commissariats"
 RCT_mobilise_labor_desc:0 "We must do everything we can to ensure our liberated country does not fall. We shall found a new agency whose responsibilities will be mobilization planning, soldier drafting and training. Every young citizen will be required to report to the local commissariat for assessment for military service."
 
 RCT_industrialise_everything:0 "Mass Industrialisation"
 RCT_industrialise_everything_desc:0 "Comrade Caramel's mass industrialisation program needs to be implemented at once!

 RCT_independent_socialism:0 "Democracy Prevails"

 RCT_market_socialism:0 "The Principles Of Market Socialism"
 RCT_market_socialism_desc:0 "No one can deny the benefits of having a market economy. It drives development and growth better than anything else. However, individuals are prone to exploit it to their own advantage. By gradually abolishing private ownership and introducing cooperatives and syndicates, every worker will be an owner who will receive their fair share of the profits."
 
 RCT_agrarian_coops:0 "Establish Agrarian Cooperatives"
 RCT_agrarian_coops_desc:0 "We must not neglect rural regions, despite them being more conservative and opposed to our values. Private farms will be replaced with cooperatives and countless ponies who used to be workers will now become owners of farms. Resources and profits will be divided to each according to their need."
 
 RCT_economic_autarky:0 "Economic Autarky Plan"
 RCT_economic_autarky_desc:0 "We are surrounded by anti-communists on all sides. We must prepare for a worst-case scenario where they close their borders and make trade impossible. Science can be our saviour: To ensure self-sufficiency we can invest in resource-gathering technologies and synthetic refineries."
 
 RCT_urbanise_coltstream:0 "Urbanise Wild-Vodina"
 RCT_urbanise_coltstream_desc:0 "Coltstream has great potential of becoming a sister city of Rijekograd. Wild-Vodina is largely a rural state, so we should use subsidies to attract local farmers to move into the town and become factory workers. This way we will kill two griffons with one stone: Wild-Vodina will urbanize and Coltstream will grow into a proper city."
 
 RCT_urbanise_coltonia:0 "Urbanise Coltonia"
 RCT_urbanise_coltonia_desc:0 "Coltonia is another largely rural state, but it has two relatively large cities, Zagrep and Virmanevitica. Investing in eastern Rijeka and subsidizing new industrial cooperatives will ensure the cities grow even larger."
 
 RCT_control_the_unions:0 "Unions In Politics"

Our armies must march south and free the poor ponies of Barrad, zebras of Nyumba and deer of Cervasia who have suffered for far too long."
 
 RCT_stalliongrad_of_the_east:0 "Stalliongrad Of The East"
 RCT_stalliongrad_of_the_east_desc:0 "Comrade Steel Stallion of Equestria was our original inspiration and showed us how workers can overcome any opposition to overthrow their oppressors. We have followed in his hoofsteps and have created a Stalliongrad of our own! Let us now rejoice and breathe free at last."

 RCT_industry_electronics:0 "Nationalize KONJČAR"
 RCT_industry_electronics_desc:0 "KONJČAR is a manufacturer of electrical components and has grown quickly in recent years, yet has become rather indebted. We must secure the supply of vital parts by nationalizing the company and taking care of their debts."
 
 RCT_industry_infrastructur:0 "Invest In Infrastructure"
 RCT_industry_infrastructur_desc:0 "Riverlands are very mountainous, which makes roads expensive to build. Nevertheless, the importance of transport infrastructure cannot be overstated. Our national companies shall begin work immediately and connect our major cities and towns."
 
 RCT_industry_civ_factories:0 "Support Wood Industry"
 RCT_industry_civ_factories_desc:0 "We have many forested hills and mountains, as well as rivers which can be used to easily transport lumber. Our wood industry's growth shall continue stronger than before with governmental support: Investments, debt relief and nationalization."
 
 RCT_industry_reduce_Illiteracy:0 "Compulsory Education"
 RCT_industry_reduce_Illiteracy_desc:0 "During her last term River Swirl founded many public schools across the nation, but only a fraction of our foals attend them. A new law will make school attendance compulsory up to a certain age, for both fillies and colts."
 
 RCT_industry_computing:0 "Equestrian Computing"
 RCT_industry_computing_desc:0 "During River Swirl's term some cooperation was established with Equestrian universities and schools, which were developing computing machines. Now our scientists are developing our very first analog computers based on western research. With our subsidies, they'll be able to make a breakthrough."
 
 RCT_industry_all_in_one:0 "Connect Coltstream And Rijekograd"
 RCT_industry_all_in_one_desc:0 "While a regular road exists between Colstream and Rijekograd, a modern railroad should be constructed across the Green river. Colstream will become more tightly connected to the capital, allowing increased commerce and industrial cooperation between the two cities."
 
 RCT_industry_millitary_factories:0 "Rijekan Arms Industry"
 RCT_industry_millitary_factories_desc:0 "Our military industry is average, but with the geopolitical situation changing it needs to improve. By imposing tariffs on foreign weapons and getting equipment for our army from domestic producers instead, we will encourage the growth of our arms industry."
 
 RCT_industry_reduce_poverty:0 "Welfare Programs"
 RCT_industry_reduce_poverty_desc:0 "Despite the growth of our economy many ponies continue to languish in poverty. With this new program we will pass a series of reforms aiming to improve the lives of our populace. Benefits, basic security and free public services for all!"
 
 RCT_industry_resource_tech:0 "Conduct Geological Survey"
 RCT_industry_resource_tech_desc:0 "We already know our many mountains contain countless riches, but using modern methods to carry out a comprehensive survey of the land will allow us to know more exactly where these deposists are and what their size is. After the survey, we must decide how to invest our limited funds."
 
 RCT_industry_steel_work:0 "Rijekograd Steelworks"
 RCT_industry_steel_work_desc:0 "Steel is the backbone of modern industry, and thus iron processing is a vital industry. Our rich mines already produce a great amount of ore and we found several rich deposits in our survey, but our steel mills are a bottleneck. They must be expanded at once! With our funds, new state-owned mills will be built in the capital and we shall become one of the greatest producers of steel in the East."
 
 RCT_industry_alumimum_work:0 "Aluminium Smelters"
 RCT_industry_alumimum_work_desc:0 "The survey revealed that Wild-Vodina has notable deposits of bauxite ore. Mining operations in the region must be expanded greatly and modern smelters built in Coltstream. Our aluminium production is predicted to grow rapidly with our investment."
 
 RCT_industry_improve_society_2:0 "Legalize Labour Unions"
 RCT_industry_improve_society_2_desc:0 "The legal status of trade unions has long been unclear. Now it is time for us to legalize and recognize them. They are clearly beneficial for not only workers but employers as well."
 
 RCT_industry_improve_society_1:0 "Increased Industrialization"
 RCT_industry_improve_society_1_desc:0 "The growth of our economy continues even stronger than before. Our policies have been successful and new factories are opened every month. Our nation will be truly prosperous and advanced, a true forerunner of the East!"
 
 RCT_industry_research_slot:0 "University Of Rijekograd"
 RCT_industry_research_slot_desc:0 "The university of Rijekograd is among the oldest ones in the East. Now it will become among the largest ones as well. More teachers, more subjects, more students from all across the Riverlands, along with increased student exchange with our western pony relatives."
 
 RCT_industry_jets:0 "Rocket Engine Experiments"
 RCT_industry_jets_desc:0 "Some scientists in the Rijekograd university have begun developing advanced combustion engines that could propel objects over a great distance. It might be wise for us to support this program with state funding."
 
 RCT_industry_atomisiert:0 "Might Of Crystals"
 RCT_industry_atomisiert_desc:0 "While we already recognize some of the potential in the magic stored by crystals, our researches suggest we have grossly underestimated it. Done correctly, it might be possible to overload the crystals with magic and unleash it by breaking them, which would result in something... horrible.\nPerhaps we can take advantage of this."
 
 RCT_industry_science_base:0 "Dawn Of The Crystal Age"
 RCT_industry_science_base_desc:0 "Crystals are becoming an increasingly important part of our society as we learn to understand them and their secrets better. They allow us to unravel the inner workings of magic and use it in ways never imagined before. Truly, a new age is dawning for us."

 ######################### Military Focuses ########### Round 2 this time without Psody ;-; ########
 
 RCT_military_start:0 "Focus on the Military"
 RCT_military_start_desc:0 "The River Armed Forces are one of the most modern in the East, but that does not mean we can ignore its development. We must reform it for the future, because warfare is always evolving."
 
 RCT_grand_army_of_the_republic:0 "Grand Army of the Republic"
 RCT_grand_army_of_the_republic_desc:0 "We should hold a military parade to not only show our citizens how great our army truly is, but to also boost its popularity which will get us many more recruits in no time."
 
 RCT_inf_stuff:0 "Finest Weaponry"
 RCT_inf_stuff_desc:0 "The bread and butter of any army are the common infantryponies, so we should make sure they are all equipped with the finest guns of the east."
 
 RCT_river_games_military:0 "The River War Games"
 RCT_river_games_military_desc:0 "A large military exercise where all members of the River Coalition participate will not only strengthen our bonds, but will also give our ponies some much needed practice so that they are prepared for the real fight."
 
 RCT_unicorn:0 "Fund Unicorn Training Camps"
 RCT_unicorn_desc:0 "Unicorns can turn the tide with their magic and many battles have been won thanks to them. We should fund more training camps for unicorns so they are capable to support the army even more than they already do."
 
 RCT_pegasus:0 "Fund Pegasus Flight Camps"
 RCT_pegasus_desc:0 "While we are physically weaker than griffons, our pegasi have proven time and time again that they can fight evenly in the air, and what they lack in strength they make up in speed. Funding more flight camps will ensure our pegasi have the upper hoof in aerial combat."
 
 RCT_ask_allies:0 "Aid From Allies"
 RCT_ask_allies_desc:0 "Our friends in the Coalition have their own army traditions and modernization programs. We should ask them about their art of war and exchange our knowledge. This way we not only find out what they are doing, but also learn new strategies, tactics and training methods."
 
 RCT_art_stuff:0 "Death From Afar"
 RCT_art_stuff_desc:0 "Artillery is the foundation of modern warfare and has proven its usefulness time and time again. Only a fool would not thrive to make them better and better then they already are."
 
 RCT_moutain_guns:0 "Mountain Guns"
 RCT_moutain_guns_desc:0 "We have many mountains within our land, so we should make sure that our artillery is designed and built with that in mind. This will make our army able to rain shells on our foes from above."
 
 RCT_mobile:0 "Modern Transports"
 RCT_mobile_desc:0 "Thanks to combustion engines our soldiers no longer need to pull wagons on their own. To take full advantage of this technology we must make our vehicles as swift as the rivers. Our manufacturers will be given more funds the faster their trucks are."
 
 RCT_tanks:0 "Armoured Fighting Vehicle"
 RCT_tanks_desc:0 "There is a new innovation that is used on the battlefield in the west, the so called "tank", that has a great amount of potential. With armoured vehicles it is easy to strike at the enemy swiftly and break through defences that otherwise would be impenetrable. We should immediately begin researching these "tanks"."
 
 RCT_doctrain_2:0 "Better Doctrines for the Army"
 RCT_doctrain_2_desc:0 "Our military doctrines are slowly becoming outdated, since there are many new innovations in warfare that we do not yet understand. Sending observers abroad to study the most modern militaries should allow us to reform our doctrines."
 
 RCT_mobile2:0 "Combined Arms"
 RCT_mobile2_desc:0 "What our research showed us was clear: tanks and motorized infantry go hoof to hoof. The two must be combined into a single unit, but that is not all. We also have to make sure that we have the newest models out there, as what good do combined arms do if the arms are outdated?"
 
 RCT_staff_start:0 "Capable Officers"
 RCT_staff_start_desc:0 "A good commander can lead a dozen sheep to victory against an army of wolves. We must ensure we have enough officers and that they are well-trained to fight a modern war."
 
 RCT_defensive_staff:0 "Defensive Chief of Army"
 RCT_defensive_staff_desc:0 "The most senior officer of the River Army must have a defensive mindset. The Riverlands have many natural defenses, such as rivers, mountains and forests, and it would be foolish not to utilize them."
 
 RCT_offensive_staff:0 "Offensive Chief of Army"
 RCT_offensive_staff_desc:0 "The River Army's leader should not foolishly rely solely on our defences, but must remain active for modern warfare is offensive and mobile warfare. We cannot allow our enemy to prepare attacks in peace, but harass them and break their lines."
 
 RCT_special_ops:0 "Special Forces Battalion"
 RCT_special_ops_desc:0 "We need to establish a unit dedicated to fulfilling special missions, during both war and peace. They will receive extensive, even dangerous training and be given our finest equipment to ensure they are the best of the best. All are invited, few are chosen."
 
 RCT_expand_officer_academy:0 "Dubrovneigh Military Academy"
 RCT_expand_officer_academy_desc:0 "We have a shortage of trained officers in the Army. This must be addressed at once! Dubrovneigh Military Academy shall receive more funding from us, more student applications will be approved and more officers will be sent to teach the cadets."
 
 RCT_promote_best:0 "Promote the Best"
 RCT_promote_best_desc:0 "Some of our new cadets have proven to be very promising. Once they finish their training, we should not force them to climb the ladders of ranks but instead immediately promote them to higher positions. We are lacking senior officers, and this will solve the issue."
 
 RCT_light_infantry_training:0 "Light Infantry Training"
 RCT_light_infantry_training_desc:0 "While modern warfare has greatly reduced the old distinctions between heavy and light infantry, we can still train some of our units to be specialized light divisions. They will lack heavy weapons and vehicles but are more tactically mobile and can execute missions in rough terrain and poor weather."
 
 RCT_more_marines:0 "River Marines"
 RCT_more_marines_desc:0 "Riverlands has -- as the name implies -- numerous rivers. They form an obstacle to many units, but not to marines who are specialized in amphibious assault and excel in crossing rivers with ease. Without a doubt, our army should include well-trained marine units."
 
 RCT_expand_air:0 "Look to the Skies"
 RCT_expand_air_desc:0 "Modern warfare will be about the skies as much as the land. Planes are not impeded by rough terrain or the many rivers that flow through our land. But before we can expand our air force, we will need to build proper airbases and an aircraft factory."
 
 RCT_bombers:0 "Riverland Bombers"
 RCT_bombers_desc:0 "We will focus on procuring new designs for a bomber aircraft. Tactical bombers combine the speed and agility of close air support with some of their strategic destructive potential of their larger brethren. Such a versatile plane will be a safe pick for the backbone of our airforce."
 
 RCT_fighters:0 "Riverland Interceptors"
 RCT_fighters_desc:0 "When the griffons will inevitably strike our nation, they will seek to fill the skies with their malevolent bombers. To counter this, we must develop a state of the art interceptor, capable of scrambling quickly to take out these threats to innocent pony lives. Our air force will be built around a core of interceptors and fighters."
 
 RCT_cas:0 "The Skydiver Corps"
 RCT_cas_desc:0 "We will train a group of fearless ponies to pilot a corps of special bombers. These close air support ponies will dive from great height to surprise and destroy enemy troop concentrations. Disrupting enemy supply chains and staging grounds will surely destroy the morale of our opponents. Of course we still have to actually build a plane capable of this..."
 
 RCT_strat_doctrine:0 "River Rains Doctrine"
 RCT_strat_doctrine_desc:0 "We will bring the Riverland rains to the enemy! But they will find that it isn’t water that falls from the sky, but a flood of bombs. The River Rains Doctrine will see us mass long range bombers and their escorts to destroy the enemy’s vital infrastructure. When we can reach their homes, they will surely give up!"
 
 RCT_fighter_doctrine:0 "Aerial Wave Doctrine"
 RCT_fighter_doctrine_desc:0 "To protect our dear homeland, we must make sure that no opponent makes it through to our country, both in the air and on the land. Waves of small fighters will protect us from enemy bombers and waves of close air support will mow down any catbird foolish enough to set their claws down in our land."
 
 RCT_long_range_planes:0 "Beyond the River"
 RCT_long_range_planes_desc:0 "To properly protect our country, we must venture forth beyond our home to meet our enemy head on. Bigger engines, better aerodynamics and larger fuel tanks will be needed to create the designs we need for the task. Let’s let the designponies loose to see what they come up with."
 
 RCT_expand_air_defense:0 "From the Ground Up"
 RCT_expand_air_defense_desc:0 "Airplanes are expensive marvels of technology. The cost of bringing a gun into the air is much larger than the cost of having a larger gun on the ground. Fixed anti-air emplacements and ground based, towed anti-aircraft guns are an economical choice to protect our troops from enemy air raids."
 
 RCT_expand_radar:0 "Radio Detection"
 RCT_expand_radar_desc:0 "Our lands are vast and our planes can only patrol so much of our airspace. By using radar stations, we will multiply the effectiveness of our fighters, by making sure that our planes are in the right place at the right time!"
 
 RCT_expand_air_production:0 "Fill the Skies!"
 RCT_expand_air_production_desc:0 "The fighters and bombers that we chose to be the backbone of our air force, need to be produced in greater numbers. The air war is a game of numbers and when it comes down to it, the country with the largest air force will rule the sky. With an optimised production process, we will make sure that we will not be out produced."
 
 RCT_form_navy:0 "Mouth of the River"
 RCT_form_navy_desc:0 "We have secured a coast for ourselves, but without a proper navy, we will not be able to capitalise on this strategic opportunity. It is time to invest in our new coastal holdings to stimulate the construction of dockyards."
 
 RCT_destroyer_start:0 "Starting Small"
 RCT_destroyer_start_desc:0 "We are new to the way of the waves, so let us not overcomplicate matters. A destroyer is the smallest military ship type and we should be able to start production relatively easily and get ourselves the beginnings of a fleet."
 
 RCT_crusers:0 "Out to Sea!"
 RCT_crusers_desc:0 "Cruisers are larger ships, worthy of the endless seas beyond our horizons. These ships will require more skilled ponies to make, but with dedication and time, our country will have its own cruiser!"
 
 RCT_battleships:0 "Construct Battleships"
 RCT_battleships_desc:0 "A grand nation such as ours requires a grand navy. Prestige and honour is bestowed upon those countries who have battleships in their fleet. These proud ships break the waves with their large size and massive firepower. A fleet planned around a battleship is a fleet made for victory!"
 
 RCT_battleship_doctrine:0 "Fleet in Making"
 RCT_battleship_doctrine_desc:0 "Although our grand fleet is not finished yet, we will have a doctrine to project our naval force across the water. Our people once came from an ocean away, so we should not shy away from the deep blue."
 
 RCT_super_battleship:0 "Project Oversize"
 RCT_super_battleship_desc:0 "We will endeavour to produce the biggest, most heavily armed battleships that could ever sail the ocean. Huge siege guns, massive engines and impenetrable armour will make it so that our monster ship will flatten anything standing in its way. Our foes will shake in fear when this giant approaches!"
 
 RCT_carriers:0 "A Seaborne Air Force "
 RCT_carriers_desc:0 "Although seafaring is still new to us, we are more accustomed to the idea of an air force. Luckily, new breakthroughs in naval warfare have seen the rise of the aircraft carrier, a ship that acts as a mobile air base. The firepower of these planes ensure that this ship can strike beyond the range of any ship’s guns and be a formidable threat to any fleet."
 
 RCT_carrier_doctrine:0 "Strike from the Sky!"
 RCT_carrier_doctrine_desc:0 "We will build our naval doctrine around these carriers. Our carrier planes will swarm the skies, while our fleet lies in wait, protecting our floating airbases. Without warning our squads of bombers will descend upon an unsuspecting fleet, sinking it before they ever reach any of our vessels!"
 
 RCT_carrier_aircraft:0 "A Naval Aviation Branch"
 RCT_carrier_aircraft_desc:0 "We must make a separate branch of the navy that concerns itself with naval aviation. By placing experts from our air force and our new navy together in one office, they might learn to overcome the challenges that the air and the sea bring."
 
 RCT_river_sea:0 "Flow Into The Sea"
 RCT_river_sea_desc:0 "Truly, the destination of the river has always been the ocean. We have finally embraced our seabound destiny. Now that we have made the ocean our own domain, the world lies open to us! While water still flows through the rivers, we shall reach out over the ocean, into the wide world!"
 
 RCT_more_naval_bases:0 "Dock Development Grants"
 RCT_more_naval_bases_desc:0 "We will encourage the construction of new dockyards with grants, as to ensure that we will have adequate port facilities in the future. A little conniving will go a long way to convince our stubborn Rijekans that the sea is the place to be."
 
 RCT_even_more_naval_bases:0 "Shipwright Training Program"
 RCT_even_more_naval_bases_desc:0 "We must set up a program to train all sort of naval support personal. Shipwrights, dockworkers, harbourmasters and more will be needed to support our ever growing fleet. . ."
 
 RCT_even_more_convoys:0 "River Merchant Marine"
 RCT_even_more_convoys_desc:0 "Overseas trade is a staple of the modern world, but until recently was an avenue cut off for us. Now that our military fleet is well underway, we must ensure that we have enough transport ships for supplies, troops and rescources."


 #### EVENTS  ####
 rivercity.13.t:0 "The Poverty Issue"
 rivercity.13.d:0 "One of the bitterest and most acrimonious disputes between the Harmonist and Socialist parties is the issue of poverty. Thousands of mares and stallions live on barest subsistence, and it is extremely hard for any of the poor to find gainful employment. This stagnation has continued for several years now, and both sides blame each other for failing to act appropriately. The Harmonists, being the majority party, have proposed a bill that would increase investment in industry and infrastructure, arguing that this growth would create new jobs for the poor to take up and lift themselves out of poverty, while the Socialists are unconvinced, preferring the implementation of extensive social welfare programmes. Nova Whirl, leader of the Socialist opposition party, has condemnded the Harmonist plan, calling it the "Fat Cat Benefit Act", and has threatened to expel any Socialist that supports it from her party. If more than 90% of her party follows her line on this issue, then the Harmonists may fail to secure a big enough majority to pass the bill."

 rivercity.16.t:0 "The Rural/Urban Divide"
 rivercity.16.d:0 "The second issue to cause dissent in the parliament is the issue of rural versus urban concerns. The Harmonist party draws much of its support from the rural farming population, while the Socialists rely almost entirely on urbanites and factory workers for their votes. However, in recent years the farmers have begun to feel that even the Harmonists are not really their friends, as they have spent more and more time dealing with budgetary and economic concerns, and less time addressing the issues that matter to them. They complain of a lack of good infrastructure, making it hard to sell their crops, of the high cost of fertiliser, making farming less profitable than it could be, and especially of the lack of policing in remote rural areas. River Swirl absolutely cannot afford to lose the farmers' support, and so she has drafted a Rural Development Plan with a view to consolidating their loyalty to Harmony. The Socialists, understandably, are less enthusiastic about this plan. While they cannot scupper the Bill entirely, they are advising that it be amended substantially to spread its funding between urban and rural areas - a move that would benefit them, and only them. The only question that remains is whether or not they will be able to secure enough support from the less-loyal Harmonists to get what they want..."

 rivercity.19.t:0 "The Talzar Commune"
 rivercity.19.d:0 "The third issue that has come before the Cabinet is an odd one. A group of urbanite, upper-middle class city ponies has left their dwellings in Rijekograd and taken up a primitive, agrarian mode of existence in the Talzar Hills. They have begun to forget that they are, in fact, part of our country, and ignore the central government's orders. They refuse to pay their taxes, refuse to respect police officers, and in general act as if they were a completely independent country. Things have come to a head, as a tax collector was attacked by the Talzarites when she tried to force them to comply with the law. This has led to fresh tensions in government. On the one hoof, this is a flagrant attack on a government official, and cannot be tolerated. On the other, the official was a tax collector, and most of the public is having a hard time mustering much sympathy for a tax collector. Still, there is a general consensus that *something* ought to be done about these play-pretend farmers. After much wrangling, it has been agreed that one more diplomatic envoy should be sent to tell them to buzz off, but both political parties have suggested their own candiates for the task. The Harmonists favor the hard-nosed marshal Hector Lipizzan, while Nova Whirl herself has offered to go as the Socialist representative."

 rivercity.22.d:0 "It is no secret that River Swirl and Nova Whirl hate each other, and constantly attempt to undermine each other's positions, but it was only today that their mutual disdain came fully to a head. At the climax of a particularly heated debate, Nova Whirl publicly proclaimed a motion of No Confidence in the Chancellor, and as if planned in advance, her entire party followed behind her. This puts River Swirl in an untenable position - she can no longer run a democratic government without at least the nominal confidence of the second largest party. If her own party was united, they might have been able to press on and simply ignore the Socialists, but the HSR is a loose coalition of conservatives, liberals, and mild socialists united only by their fear and mistrust of the SKR. Many of her own party members abstained from voting or even (shockingly) voted No Confidence also, leaving the Chancellor with few options. She will have to go back to the polls."
 rivercity.22.a:0 "Dissolve the Government and hold a snap election!"

 rivercity.23.d:0 "As part of the campaign trail, both candidates have engaged in an extensive debate in Coltovac. As both are well-known for hating each other and have intimate knowledge of each other's political foibles, this debate drew a huge crowd, expecting to see mud-slinging on an unprecedented scale - and they were not disappointed. Though the umpire tried to keep the debate on point, it quickly devolved into a shouting match about who was responsible for the government's inability to get anything done. Police eventually had to disperse the crowd and end the "debate" prematurely in order to prevent a riot from breaking out. Nonetheless, the crowd on that day was more impressed..."

 rivercity.24.t:0 "Day of The Deputy"
 rivercity.24.d:0 "As the short snap election nears its close, both parties realised the need to keep River Swirl and Nova Whirl away from each other, for fear that the closing debate of the campaign woud result in a riot in the capital. As such, this debate was chaired by a representative chosen by the party leadership, rather than by the party heads themselves. On one side, the Harmonists were represented by Marshal Hector Lipizzan, while the Socialist Party elected Nova's second-in-command, Caramel Haze, to speak for them. This debate, though more orderly than the previous, was still filled with fiery oration, as Caramel Haze is a far more stringent Stallionist than Nova Whirl, while Hector is a stern anti-Communist. Thankfully, the animated rhetoric did not result in animated rioters, and at the end of the day, the crowd was most convinced by..."

 rivercity.26.t:0 "The Emergency Powers Bill"
 rivercity.26.d:0 "The HSR is a broad tent of political viewpoints, united only by their fear and hatred of Communism. As such, they rarely agree on anything, and River Swirl cannot even trust the majority of them to support her on hard issues most of the time. However, today, in a rare display of unity, the party has unanimously passed a resolution to provide the Chancellor with wide-ranging powers in the event of an "Emergency". Ostensibly meant to preserve the Republic's ability to fight wars and suppress rebellion without being crippled by obstructionist politicians, many note that the Bill leaves the definition of "Emergency" up entirely to the discretion of the Chancellor, and thus is a dangerous first step on the path to autocracy. Despite these concerns, the HSR has been so disgusted by the recent Socialist attempt to paralyse our democracy that it has consented to allow this bill to be drawn up. The Bill was voted through by a rare united front of Harmonists, and now all that River Swirl needs to do is sign the Bill into law..."
 rivercity.26.a:0 "I must think this over for a while"
 
 rivercity.27.t:0 "Red Saturday"
 rivercity.27.d:0 "Though they were allies for as long the the Harmonists were in power, Nova Whirl has never seen eye to eye with her second-in-command, Caramel Haze. He was always too radical, too willing and ready to fight, too dismissive of stategy or common sense. He was a fanatic, assured that all that was needed for the Revolution to succeed was for Communists to fight for it with sufficient zeal. In fact, when Nova once asked him in exasperation whether he would prefer fighting the entire River Coalition alone to subverting the bourgeois democracy from within first, he immediately replied with a "Yes".\n It was for these reasons, among others, that the two have never gotten along that well. Today, that division has flared up in a dramatic way. Caramel Haze, as a high-ranking army general, has authority over many divisions, and it has come to the attention of Nova's spies that the divisions assigned to protect Rijekograd have slowly been rotated out over the last few weeks in favor of units nominally under Haze's control. This is a deeply worrying sign, for the two socialist leaders have recently argued in the parliament, and it seems that Caramel's patience has finally run out. All the evidence points to the early stages of a coup. Will Nova Swirl's spies report back in time?"
 rivercity.27.a:0 "Caramel's loyal soldiers seize control of the government!"
 rivercity.27.b:0 "The spies' report makes it through, and the Army arrests Caramel."
 
 rivercity.1917.t:0 "Nova Whirl Sends An Invitation"
 rivercity.1917.d:0 "A delegation from Rijekograd arrived in our capital today. They presented us a formal invitation from Chancellor Nova Whirl to join the new Riverland Socialist Union, which will replace the old River Coalition. Treaty of Coltstream and all its clauses will be nullified and all countries are asked to sign the new Treaty of Rijekograd, which requires every member nation to have a socialist constitution that abolishes private ownership and promotes liberty and equality in all facets of society. If we do not accept, we will not join this Union."

We have sent our military to confiscate the illegal weaponry and have made several arrests, but we fear it was only the tip of the icebergs and that numerous armed militia units are being organized in secret. The arrested individuals refuse to reveal who is supporting them but spouted several communist slogans."

She proposes the unification of our two countries, with us becoming a federal state with its own legislation and government. She reasons that workers of the East should stand together because divided they are too weak to resist foreign reactionaries."

 rivercity.1923.t:0 "Evidence of Coltstream Tampering"
 rivercity.1923.d:0 "When [From.GetName] noticed that after recent additions to the treaties and regulations that make up the River Coalition, support for socialism gradually increased, they sent out a commission of bureaucrats and investigators to find out what was causing the changing attitudes amongst their populace. After a thorough investigation, they discovered that the River Republic had snuck in changes to the treaty of Coltstream. These directives went unnoticed by our diplomats and were hidden in the middle of a list of insignificant changes in an already massive mountain of paperwork. The additions`, made by the Rijekan chief representative at the last minute, seemed harmless at first sight, so that [From.GetAdjective] bureaucrats just followed directives without question as they were unable to see the bigger picture. However, the investigators found out that these innocently worded changes were in fact vehicles to increase socialist support throughout the Riverlands.\n\nIn a public press conference, [From.GetAdjective] officials named the culprit; Nova Whirl’s River Republic. The announcement was followed by angry reactions from most countries in the Riverlands, who accused the Rijekans of abusing their trust. Soon after, Nova Whirl sent a letter of apology, promising that they will not intervene with other members’ affairs again."
 rivercity.1923.a:0 "Hopefully she keeps her word."
 
 rivercity.1924.t:0 "Investigation Yields No Results"
 rivercity.1924.d:0 "After a thorough investigation of the recent increase of socialist popularity, our team of bureaucrats and investigators traced the cause to a new River Coalition directive. Churning through the heaps of paperwork that make up such a directive, they even found the exact changes that were responsible. The minutes of the meeting of diplomats show that these changes were made at the last minute, deep at night. Interviews show that every representative and staff member was eager to get to bed and none of them remember exactly who made the change. Vague memories from attending staff and incomplete minutes mean that we may never find who is responsible for spreading socialism through our nation."

Most of them came down to Nova Whirl’s socialist government influencing the people of the Riverlands through secret changes in the treaties made between the River Coalition members. Of course Nova Whirl apologised again, blaming overzealous subordinates and bureaucratic errors. However, [From.GetLeader] was clearly done with Nova Whirl’s apologies and pushed through the emergency vote. It is now up to every leader of the coalition to cast a vote to either expel [RCT. GetName] or leave them in the coalition. The fate of the Rijekans would be decided by a majority vote. . ."

Reactionaries, monarchs and capitalists who oppressed the workers of the Riverlands have all been defeated. Now that our neighbours have embraced the way of progress, we are free to build a socialist future for all. However, many things still remain to be done if our nation is to become a shining beacon for the world to follow. In a speech broadcast to all corners of the Riverlands, [Getleader] laid out the plans for the future. Culture, economy and military would all be integrated, to ensure optimal cooperation between the Riverland people. We have come a long way, but the road ahead is longer still."
 rivercity.1927.a:0 "Socialists of the Riverlands, unite!"
 
 rivercity.1928.t:0 "Resistance To Monoculturalization"
 rivercity.1928.d:0 "It appears that our efforts to combat nationalist and reactionary elements amongst the differing cultures of the union has been met with much resistant. Strikes and protests have been ever more frequent as our friends cling to their backward traditions. However, the problems seem to be so severe that local governments may be unable to handle the outbreaks of nationalist sentiment. The central government must intervene. We can choose to give concessions to the strikers, but risk losing the progress we have made, or we can send in the army to enforce cultural unity."

 rivercity.1929.t:0 "Resistance To Army Reformation"
 rivercity.1929.d:0 "Before our glorious union sprawled across the Riverlands, the armed forces of the nations now under our control were vestiges of national pride. The Nimbusian hoplite, the Monks from Pònaidhean and the army of Lake City were an integral part of their countries’ cultures, but their time has come. However, it has proven to be a huge undertaking to mould all these martial traditions into our own Union Army. Soldiers and officers from multiple provinces refuse our instructions, training their ancient doctrines or in some cases, refuse to train at all until the central government promises to preserve their military tradition. Do we concede to the soldiers’ demand, or do we whip them into shape?"
 rivercity.1929.a:0 "Discipline these deviants."
 rivercity.1929.b:0 "Let’s give them some time to get used to us."
 
 rivercity.1930.t:0 "Resistance To Economic Reorganisation"
 rivercity.1930.d:0 "`The road to a socialist economy is long and arduous. Some clans in the highlands of Pònaidhean still used bartering, while the dogs of Diamond Mountain have a hard time to build a slave-free economy. The abolishment of private property and sometimes moves against slavery and serfdom have led to a lack of some goods the people have grown accustomed to. This has led to complaints from our local governments, who say that they cannot explain to their citizens that socialism is not yet providing for everypony, unlike what the propaganda claims. We could give local governments some leeway to introduce some temporary privatisation to relieve the pressure, but doing so will set back our progress. Alternatively, we could use central government resources to support local collectivisation efforts and provide the most basic needs."
 rivercity.1930.a:0 "Continue collectivisation!"
 rivercity.1930.b:0 "We can allow some capitalism for now. . ."
 
 rivercity.1931.t:0 "Nationalism Persists"
 rivercity.1931.d:0 "Despite the best efforts of our security forces and propagandists, nationalist resistance groups continue to be a threat to the revolution. The vast and rugged Riverlands provide excellent staging grounds for these organisations who operate in the shadows. When we close down an illegal printing press in one place, an armoury gets raided for guns somewhere else. We seem to be making little headway in uprooting the counterrevolutionary threat. In fact, some bureaucrats in the capital are suggestion that we stop our efforts and negotiate with these groups, so that we can stop the unrest. Of course that would cause us to lose all progress we did make."
 rivercity.1931.a:0 "We do not negotiate with terrorists."

 rivercity.1932.t:0 "Hector Leads A Revolt!"
 rivercity.1932.d:0 "Ever since the socialist government assumed power over the Republic, reactionary forces have been mustering. At first they merely complained, then they protested, then they rioted. Each time, the police and armed forces urged them to to peacefully dissipate, and strife was avoided."
 rivercity.1932.a:0 "They must be stopped at once!"
 
 rivercity.1933.t:0 "Caramel Leads A Revolt!"
 rivercity.1933.d:0 "After the Harmonists regained control of the parliament, many socialists became bitter and abandoned Nova Whirl and her policy of peaceful revolution. General Caramel Haze, a devout socialist, has been disobeying orders of his superiors more and more, and divisions under his command seem to be utterly loyal to him. OHS agents reported that he was building up support in the towns and cities, but their reports came too late and they were unable to stop him. Caramel's soldiers have now seized control of several towns and a new socialist government has been formed with Caramel Haze as its leader. They are broadcasting radio propaganda claiming that they are the rightful rulers of River Republic."

Your Baba back in Zagrep has suggested you give the job to your Cousin, Pumpkin Swirl.

 rivercity.3.t:0 "The Fate of the Unstable Government"
 rivercity.3.d:0 "After a series of secret meetings, an alliance of leading politicians, government employees, army officers and top business ponies have agreed that decisive action must be taken to ensure that the events that plagued the last election never happen again. There cannot be true harmony until all inharmonious elements in society have been purged or reformed. With the ever-present threat of communist, fascists, anarchists and griffons looming over the Republic, it was agreed that a temporary government lead by the Office of Harmonic Services should take power until such a time as true harmony has been achieved.\n\nRiver Swirl, horrified by such an idea, threatened to block such action which would be entirely legal under the emergency powers she had enacted. The alliance has been left with little choice than to seize power, a move that would look like a coup to the rest of the world, or to find a way to control the chancellor. Either way, it has been agreed that Director Arclight of the OHS would be the new leader of the interim government."

 BillSuccessTitle:0 "Industry, The Engine of Wealth"
 BillSuccessDesc:0 "Good news! Initial signs from the passing of the Industrial Incentive Bill are positive, as business owners and industrialists across the land are filled with confidence. Factories have begun to churn once more, and orders for raw materials have been sent out in record numbers in anticipation of brisker business. Already, new positions and openings have appeared in the labor market, and while these are few, the public have taken them as a sign that the Bill is working."

 BillFailTitle:0 "A Stimulus Failure"
 BillFailDesc:0 "Unfortunately, despite the passing of the Industrial Incentive Bill, very little has improved in the state of our economy. Of course, nopony expected the Bill to magically fix everything in a few weeks, but everyone expected at least some promising signs. Sadly, these signs have been lacking. Business leaders are not convinced that it will be enough, or are wary of being mired in the complicated tangle of laws that would be the result of accepting state funding. The common wisdom on the street is that the Bill is just another futile effort by a failing government."

 HarmonyBlamedDesc:0 "Despite the fact that Nova Whirl's Socialists were responsible for the government's plan being killed, the public is not privy to everything that happens in the halls of power. As such, the Harmonist party are taking the blame for the government's inaction and seeming impotence in the face of the poverty crisis. Opinion polls show support for the government being corroded, as the people slowly begin to believe that they might just be useless after all."
 CommBlamedDesc:0 "In an explosive press conference, River Swirl has denounced the Socialists for their meddling and intransigence, blaming them for thwarting the government's attempts to save the economy. Though some consider this an excuse, many ponies are leery enough of the Socialists that they believed this, and now it seems that the Harmonists have successfully deflected the blame for the government's inaction onto the Socialist Party! The result has been a sharp, swift decline in popularity for Nova's party, threatening it with a gradual slide into irrelevance."

Some worried that there would not be enough money to ensure that anything significant got done in either area, but this turned out not to be a problem, thanks to excellent, scientific management principles. This has significantly eroded support for the Harmonists, and expanded our base among the farmers."
 MixedInvestmentFailedDesc:0 "Disaster! Our attempts to split funding efforts between rural and urban centres has divided our money in too many directions, and no single project has been a success - that is to say, the entire enterprise has been a failure. This debacle and waste of money has made us look like fools in both the cities and the countryside!"
 RuralInvestmentSuccessDesc:0 "Our investment efforts into the rural heartlands of our country have met with initial success! New roads allow farmers to transport goods to market much faster and more easily, an investment in fertilisers has raised crop yields overall, and increased police spending has led to a sharp drop in rural crime (an issue that particularly bothers those who have to live in remote areas). Overall, quality of life for the farmers seems set to improve - and they are extremely grateful to us for it."
 RuralInvestmentFailureDesc:0 "Sadly, our attempts to invest in rural infrastructure have met with failure. A mixture of bureacratic obstinance and lack of enthusiastic support by farmers has resulted in our efforts coming to nothing.

 NovaSwirlUnconvincingTitle:0 "An Embarassing Display"
 WildheartSuccessTitle:0 "Tough Love"
 WildheartFailureTitle:0 "The Talzar Terror"
 NovaSwirlConvincesDesc:0 "In a moving display, Nova Whirl has announced today the formal establishment of the Talzar Commune as an autonomous region of the River Republic. The Talzarites have, apparently, agreed to pay taxes and follow the laws of our country providing that we allow them to govern themselves. This decision, which Nova Whirl by no means had the right to make, has been seen as a direct attack on the legitimacy of River Swirl's government. Despite the outrageous overstepping of her own authority, the public as a whole seems to just be happy that the issue is dealt with, and nopony seems to be willing to go to the bother of overturning a solution that seems to be working. It seems as if the illegal decision must be allowed to stand."
 NovaSwirlUnconvincingDesc:0 "To Nova Whirl's dismay, the Talzarites were unwilling to listen to her proposal of autonomy within the Republic. They simply considered themselves 'citizens of the world', and not bound by the laws of a society they hadn't chosen to be born into. Nova Whirl's repeated attempts to convince them met with no more success, and while what happened next is not precisely clear, what is known is that Nova Whirl returned to Rijekograd in a wet, mud-soaked burlap sack. In light of her abject failure, Wildheart has taken matters into his own hooves and forcibly dispersed the Talzarites back to their own homes. The whole affair has been an embarassment to the Socialist cause, and has made the Harmonist government look altogether stronger or more competent than ever before."
 WildheartSuccessDesc:0 "Marshal Hector always had a reputation as a tough, no-nonsense commander who wouldn't take guff from anypony, even from the richest and most powerful families in the Republic. As such, when he and a hundred soldiers marched up the hills to the Talzarites and ordered them to cease squatting on land that they had no right to, they had to take notice. The professionalism of the soldiers was without peer, as not a single shot was fired, and not a single Talzarite was injured as they were frog-marched back to their houses. While some regard his methods as a little excessive, most ponies are just happy that Hector was able to slap some sense into these fools."
 WildheartFailureDesc:0 "Marshal Hector has always had a reputation as a tough-minded military commander - but perhaps his military methods aren't quite what was needed for an expedition such as this. The thick-headed, idealistic leader of the Talzar Commune immediately butted heads with Hector, and as neither was willing to back down, violence ensued. Accurate reports on what precisely transpired are impossible to come by, but what we do know is that the Talzarites fled the hills in terror, spreading stories of cruel violence. While nopony really liked the Talzarites, very few wanted to see them dead, and this display of excessive force has caused support for River Swirl to take a sharp hit. The Socialists, in particular, have turned Talzar almost into a rallying-cry, and are daily denouncing our government as illegitimate."

 #### Politics ####
 POLITICS_RIVERSWIRL_DESC:0 "River Swirl is a former teacher from Rijekograd who studied abroad in Celestia's School For Gifted Unicorns. She later entered politics and quickly rose through the ranks of the Rijeka Harmony Party. She was elected Chancellor of the River Republic in 1001 and her term was mostly successful, allowing her to win the elections for the second time. However, continued modernization has led to growing social issues in cities which in turn has greatly increased the popularity of the left. Her second term is unlikely to be as unproblematic as the first."
 POLITICS_NOVAWHIRL_DESC:0 "Nova Whirl is a rising star in the political scene of the River Republic, having entered it only in 1004. She grew in the factory district of Rijekograd, where conditions were far from ideal, which influenced her political values greatly. Soon enough she joined a socialist youth club where she discussed the Stalliongrad revolution with others. Eventually she developed her own ideology of market socialism and international gradualist reform, and finally entered politics to turn her dream into a reality."

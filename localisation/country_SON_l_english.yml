### Leader & general desc ###

SON_zonni_desc:0 "Zonni Zolon is a scion of a minor aristocratic family that was never particularly influential in Zar-Hay. During the years of Mazwian rule, the family developed a negative reputation of collaboration with the oppressors, and Zonni's father even married a Mazwian mare. Zonni has carried this burden of shame his entire life and has done everything he could to prove he was a true Zar-Hay zebra. He rallied disgruntled warriors and staged an uprising against Mazwian rule as news arrived of Storm King's victory in the south. He proved to be an astute strategist and drove off the Mazwian garrison with minimal casualties. Afterwards he was hailed as a hero by the common castes, yet the tribal chiefs distrusted him still. As it seemed Zonni needed to do more to earn their respect, he accepted the title of Crown Regent and intends to lead his tribe to greatness. Once he has vanquished all the enemies of Zar-Hay, perhaps the Zolon family will finally be redeemed."
SON_azkhai_desc:0 "The Zughe family, once the rulers of Zar-Hay, were kept hostage in Ziani for many generations. They were allowed to live peacefully in relatively good conditions, but were forbidden from ever leaving the capital of the Imperial Mazwi. Therefore when Azkhai was a young colt, his world was small, not extending beyond the heavily guarded walls of his home.\n\nEverything changed when the Storm King attacked.\n\nAzkhai had grown into a stallion, eager to get out of the glorified prison and return to his true homeland. When Ziani burned, he saw his opportunity to escape. As his home was left unguarded, he escorted his family through a burning city, evading the pillaging yeti warriors and escaping to the countryside with the help of Euzegoar of Alwani, who had also been kept hostage. He finally entered the wider world, leading his family on a dangerous journey to a safe haven in Re'em which openly welcomed refugees from the collapsing Mazwi Empire.\n\nOnce his family had a safe home in Re'em, Azkhai prepared to return to Zar-Hay and claim his rightful throne. However, he heard of the ambitions of the half-Mazwian Crown Regent, who he did not trust in the slightest. Therefore he chose to be more cunning, remaining in hiding until the time was right and gathering support from warriors and commoners alike. Eventually, he finally revealed himself, ready to embrace his destiny."
SON_nyaberi_desc:0 "Nyaberi was born to a family of merchants, and thus her fate was chosen at birth, as was tradition in Zar-Hay. However, Nyaberi herself cared little for tradition and despised being forced to follow in her parents' hoofsteps. When she was old enough to go on trading missions by herself, she travelled further and further away from her repressive and traditionalist home. Inevitably, she ended up in Manehattan, the trade nexus of the world. Here she saw the astounding wonders of modernity, the towering buildings and the speed of the cars. Here she also learned about exotic political ideas which did not exist in her backwards home.\n\nLike so many others, Nyaberi was fascinated by the theories of Caramel Marks. In her books, she theorized that all societies were inevitably headed towards an egalitarian socialist utopia, and simply needed capitalism to fully mature first. From this, she got an idea: If she brought capitalism to her homeland, she could eventually create a thriving modern society where all were equal.\n\nOnce she returned home, she immediately started making contacts and using her profits from trade missions to establish a domestic revolutionary movement that was loyal to her. One way or another, she would fulfill her fantasies of a utopia without a rigid caste system."
SON_dongo_desc:0 "Once, Zanda Dongo was nothing more than a common peasant. His family owned a small amount of land, enough to make a living, and it seemed like he would inherit the farm once he grew older. However, as he aged he developed a volatile personality, lashing out at everyone around him. He often lost his temper and became violent. Soon enough his family grew weary of his antics decided to kick him out. Now being alone, Zanda Dongo felt lost, and wandered the countryside, getting into fights with random strangers. But one of these strangers was a warrior in the army of Zar-Hay, who was impressed by his ferocity. She recommended Zanda to her superior, who accepted Zanda into the ranks of his company. It did not take much time for Zanda to become a distinguished and brave combatant who channelled his inner anger at the enemy. He rose through the ranks and inevitably became a general of the Imperial Army."
SON_zuwa_meynsata_desc:0 "Over the years, Meynsata became Zonni's trusted right hoof mare, advising him in important matters and aiding him on the battlefield. As such, it was not surprising that she became Zonni's successor. However, she did not expect it herself. She is first and foremost a warrior, not a ruler, so she feels uncertain if she is ready to take up the mantle of Zuwa. Only time will tell if she will be able to keep the Imperial Realm of Zar-Hay intact."

SON_kingdom_with_no_king:0 "Kingdom Without A King"
SON_kingdom_with_no_king_desc:0 "The Zar-Hay were once ruled by kings and queens of the Zughe dynasty. Under their protection the city of Zao prospered and the kingdom grew wealthy. But Mazwi saw this prosperity and wanted to seize it, invading the kingdom, slaying its ruling queen and taking her foals hostage. Almost two centuries later, Mazwi suffered divine punishment delivered by the evil Storm King, yet it is widely believed the royal family of Zar-Hay perished in the chaos. We once had hope for a triumphant return of our long-lost rulers, but there has been no sign of them. The throne remains vacant and none dare seize it, fearing that the vengeful ghosts of the Zughe dynasty will curse them."

### Advisors & Concerns ###

SON_famed_griot:0 "Fassa Balleke"
SON_famed_griot_desc:0 "The Balleke family had once served the Zar-Hay kings and queens as court griots, yet after the Mazwian subjugation they had no choice but to go into exile, becoming wandering entertainers. The youngest scion of the family, Fasse Balleke, has now returned to her homeland to serve in the court once more. She is a talented molo player and has fully memorized the most important Zar-Hay mythologies and historical records. She has proven to be quite popular, and oftentimes commoners gather outside the palace to listen to her performances."
SON_chief_quaggo:0 "Chief Quaggo"
SON_chief_quaggo_desc:0 "Quaggo is the most prominent chief of Zairbanda. His family is old and respected, surviving Mazwian rule mostly intact despite harbouring deep hatred for the foreign overlords. While they have lost much of their wealth and power over the years, their prestige remains high and thus Quaggo's voice has more weight than that of most chieftains. Quaggo himself is known to be paranoid of foreigners and is especially distrustful of Zonni Zolon, the half-Mazwian regent. He eagerly anticipates the return of the rightful pure-blooded King to the throne of Zar-Hay."
SON_chieftess_amzina:0 "Chieftess Amzina"
SON_chieftess_amzina_desc:0 "Coming from the Anzongo tribe, Amzina's family rose from obscurity in recent decades thanks to savvy trade policies which made them exceptionally prosperous. Unlike more conservative tribes who remain stuck in the past, Amzina and her relatives have embraced change and rapidly adapted. Now Anzongo, once a rural province, has thriving proto-industry mostly thanks to cooperation with the local Re'emite minority. Amzina has ensured the Neighle trade route remains secure, her war canoes patrolling the waterways and gathering lucrative tolls from merchants in return."
SON_chief_faran:0 "Chief Faran"
SON_chief_faran_desc:0 "Chief Faran of Zarabara is the son of a powerful sorcerer and has followed in his hoofsteps. While his tribe is rather poor, he is still honoured as a skilled potion brewer and a master of the arcane arts. Little is known about him as he lets his deeds speak on his behalf. It is a mixture of both fear and respect that makes Faran a very influential zebra in Zar-Hay."
SON_reemite_advisor:0 "Yaniv Litzhol"
SON_general_zanda:0 "General Zanda"
SON_ndebi_political:0 "Commander Ndebi"

SON_chieftess_meynsata:0 "Chieftess Meynsata"
SON_chieftess_meynsata_desc:0 "The Zibiridugu tribe are considered strange in the rest of Zar-Hay, due to their different culture and bizarre dialect. Yet they insist to be proud subjects of Zar-Hay, having been part of the Kingdom for centuries before the rise of Imperial Mazwi. While Mazwi had annexed their lands directly, separating it from Zar-Hay, Chieftess Meynsata led a fearsome resistance to drive out the garrison and reunite with the Kingdom. Meynsata is known to be a capable warrior, having slain many foes with her spear. Zonni Zolon holds particularly deep respect for her abilities."
SON_captain_zaghe:0 "Captain Zaghe"
SON_captain_zaghe_desc:0 "Zaghe is the head of the royal retinue, usually responsible for the safety of the King. When there is no King, it is their duty to guard the Regent instead. Zaghe knows the shame of his predecessors in the past who failed to save Queen of Zar-Hay from becoming a Mazwian hostage, and is determined to redeem the stained honour of his position."
SON_chief_monzon:0 "Chief Monzon"
SON_chief_monzon_desc:0 "Before the rise of Zekuris, the False Prophet, Monzon's father was the chief of Macigena, serving the Mazwian Manza. He had tried to stop the inflammatory speeches of Zekuris, but this only resulted in a large uprising which ended in his death. His son, Monzon, managed to escape and organized a small resistance movement against the wrathful zealots. When Zonni Zolon led his armies into Macigena, he welcomed them as liberators and did what he could to aid them, hoping that he could regain control of his father's chiefdom. Indeed, his hopes have been fulfilled and he is now willing to serve the Kingdom - but his loyalty is questionable, as he'd rather be an independent, sovereign ruler than a subject."
SON_zogon:0 "Drillmaster Zogon"
SON_zogon_desc:0 "A harsh zebra, yet only as harsh as it is necessary to be. Zogon is feared by the common soldier and respected by the commanding officers. A former slavemaster, he has plentiful experience from whipping disobedient zebras back into shape. Zonni recognized his skills and realized their usefulness in the military, thus offering him a position in his army."
SON_ndebi:0 "Commander Ndebi"
SON_ndebi_desc:0 ""
SON_foreign_advisor:0 "New Model"
SON_foreign_advisor_desc:0 "New Model is an Equestrian earth pony who once served in the Royal Guard. She was always looking for improvements in the armed forces of her homeland, but quickly learned how hesitant Equestrians were about any kind of radical change. Her proposals for drastic changes to the army were rejected, which left her disillusioned. She resigned from the Guard and began travelling around the world, offering her services as a military advisor. Perhaps other countries would see the value of reformation in this age of rapid technological development."

### Foci ###

SON_summon_the_chiefs:0 "Summon The Chiefs"
SON_summon_the_chiefs_desc:0 "Zonni has grand plans for the future, yet to fulfill them, he needs to ensure that the tribal chiefs of Zar-Hay are on his side. Only with their support will he be able to fulfill his ambitions, but it is doubtful how loyal they are. Some do not even recognize Zonni as the rightful Regent! By summoning the chiefs to Zao, Zonni can secure the foundations of his rule."
SON_gather_the_griots:0 "Gather The Griots"
SON_gather_the_griots_desc:0 "Griots, the respected storytellers, poets and musicians of the Great Lakes, traditionally recorded the deeds of Kings and Queens and praised them with song. Zonni could use their help to increase his support among the commoners, but first he has to convince them to treat him like a King of old."
SON_divine_the_future:0 "Divine The Future"
SON_divine_the_future_desc:0 "How can Zonni launch his military campaigns without blessings from God and the Spirits? Not only that, but if the priests conclude by divination that he is doomed to fail, then there is no purpose in even trying. This is why Zonni must speak to the holy zebras of the country, because if the Sky Stallion is against him, then he has no hope of victory."
SON_fire_the_forges:0 "Arm The Warriors"
SON_fire_the_forges_desc:0 "The Storm King swept aside his pathetic foes with the might of his armaments, which were more advanced than anything the Zar-Hay had seen. A new age of war is upon the world and Zar-Hay must be quick to adapt if it wishes to prevail. Thankfully, with how unstable Zebrica is nowadays, it is easy to acquire weaponry as long as you contact the right individuals."
SON_protector_of_reemites:0 "Protector Of The Re'emites"
SON_protector_of_reemites_desc:0 "The Re'emites are horses with a strange religion who have long been the neighbours of Zar-Hay. They value peace and progress and thus have advanced and prosperous cities. However, they have often been persecuted by others who see their faith as heresy. Zonni knows they would be more useful as an ally than an enemy, and has an interesting idea..."
SON_an_offering_to_spirits:0 "An Offering For The Spirits"
SON_an_offering_to_spirits_desc:0 "Aside from the Sky Stallion, the Supreme God of Heaven and Earth, the Zar-Hay worship many lesser gods of the world. If Zonni wishes to succeed in his campaigns, he must gain the unwavering support of the Holle, especially those who are associated with war. For this, he must choose a fitting sacrifice worthy of the Spirits."
SON_beat_drums_war:0 "Beat The Drums Of War"
SON_beat_drums_war_desc:0 "More warriors are needed if Zonni wishes to fulfill his dreams of conquest. Therefore the free zebras of the Kingdom shall be mobilized and levies organized. It has been many years since this has been done, but Zonni has made sure that the raising of the levies will go smoothly."
SON_rebuild_the_fleet:0 "Rebuild The Fleet"
SON_rebuild_the_fleet_desc:0 "During the rebellion against the Mazwian occupiers, Zonni used war canoes to great effect, liberating Zao with a daring attack from the lake. Now, he has ordered the Zar-Hay fleet to be expanded, so it would be restored to its former glory. Zargitau would be proud, as he was the creator of the canoe and often used it against his prey and his enemies."
SON_cast_down_false_prophet:0 "Cast Down The False Prophet"
SON_cast_down_false_prophet_desc:0 "In Macigena, an evil spirit possessed a zebra who has been preaching falsehoods to others. He has amassed a shockingly large following and now wishes to impose his corrupt ways upon the other tribes of the Great Lakes. This cannot be allowed to happen! Zonni has proclaimed the Prophet's rule illegitimate, justifying the subjugation of Macigena."
SON_mercy_for_warriors:0 "Mercy For The Warriors"
SON_mercy_for_warriors_desc:0 "Some of those who fought for the false prophet were not fanatics blinded by their zealotry, but regular warriors who were loyal to their tribes. These warriors simply fulfilled their duty and Zonni respects their skills at fighting. Now he shall offer to spare them if they swear oaths of loyalty to him, and him alone."
SON_burn_the_zealots:0 "Burn The Zealots"
SON_burn_the_zealots_desc:0 "He who led zebras astray has been captured, along with his most prominent followers. They will now be dealt with and punished for their misguided actions. Without their leader, the mad cultists will become disorganized and their cause will waver. Thus, they should threaten anyone no longer."
SON_religious_freedom:0 "Freedom Of Faith"
SON_religious_freedom_desc:0 "The dogmatists tried to force all zebras of Macigena to practice their religion in a single, unified way, persecuting and punishing those who refused to do so. Now that the reign of the deceiver is over, Zonni has announced that everyone can worship the gods in whatever way they wish, without having to fear for their lives."
SON_governor_of_macigena:0 "Restore The Chiefs"
SON_governor_of_macigena_desc:0 "The time has come to integrate the tribes of Macigena into the Kingdom of Zar-Hay. They are welcome in the Kingdom, and Zonni will fully restore the power of the chiefs who were overthrown by the mad fanatics. In return, they shall swear oaths of loyalty to the crown, acknowledging the Regent as their rightful ruler."
SON_the_fallen_kingdom:0 "The Fallen Kingdom"
SON_the_fallen_kingdom_desc:0 "To the north, the King of Alwani attempted to restore his broken realm after the end of Mazwian rule, but the city of Timbucktu defied him and refused to bend the knee. Alwani is clearly a mere shadow of its former self and should be easily crushed by Zonni's army, while controlling wealthy Timbucktu will bring great prosperity to Zar-Hay."
SON_city_of_misguided:0 "The City Of Misguided Scholars"
SON_city_of_misguided_desc:0 "The intellectuals and merchants of Timbucktu defied the King of Alwani when he returned from exile, wishing to remain independent. Now they may defy Zar-Hay as well, despite suffering a total military defeat. Tradition dictates that they should recognize their rightful superiors, but they are eager to break sacred traditions. Let them face the consequences."
SON_fate_of_the_king:0 "The Fate Of The King"
SON_fate_of_the_king_desc:0 "As the warriors marched into Alwani, they managed to capture King Euzegoar. The monarch had tried to re-establish his sundered realm, but had met with failure. Now he is disgraced and powerless, yet Zonni must decide if he is worthy to keep his life, or if he should be executed to break the spirit of his supporters."
SON_desert_tribes:0 "Recruit The Desert Warriors"
SON_desert_tribes_desc:0 "King Euzegoar's army was bolstered by savages from the Zubian desert, but Zonni quickly learned to respect their fighting skills. While they were highly loyal to the King, this has changed after his defeat. They could be convinced to fight for a new master and provide their knowledge of warfare to the Zar-Hay army."
SON_governor_of_north:0 "Appoint The Zubia-Farma"
SON_governor_of_north_desc:0 "The lands of the former Kingdom of Alwani are too vast to be directly administered, and it is not possible to simply subjugate local chiefs. Many remain loyal to the former King and Timbucktu has always had its own form of government. Therefore, a new title must be created for the zebra who will govern the north on behalf of the Kingdom of Zar-Hay."
SON_subjugate_south:0 "Subjugate The South"
SON_subjugate_south_desc:0 "In the south lie the heartlands of the Great Lakes, with fertile soil and prosperous cities. Control of the entire region cannot be secured without first seizing these lands. The Mazwians knew this as it was the first place they conquered. The upcoming war will not be easy, so Zonni must ensure he is well prepared before casting the die."
SON_eternal_no_more:0 "Eternal No More"
SON_eternal_no_more_desc:0 "The Zefuwa dynasty of Gelon-Zornu is respected, to the point where even the Mazwians left them alone. Yet they had no mercy on the other kings of the Great Lakes. The Zefuwa should not expect to get preferential treatment from those who lost their royalty while they fattened themselves on food under Mazwian protection."
SON_the_golden_fields:0 "The Golden Fields"
SON_the_golden_fields_desc:0 "The lands around the lakes are very fertile, producing plentiful amounts of sorghum and millet. Indeed, Ugabi and Aoranda were the breadbasket of the Imperial Mazwi, feeding its thriving cities. The new Zar-Hay dominion will also take advantage of this, but demanding less taxes than the Mazwians did, thus gaining the favour of the locals."
SON_haughty_city_states:0 "The Haughty City-States"
SON_haughty_city_states_desc:0 "After being subjugated, the city-states of Hayzebland immediately began demanding privileges and autonomy in exchange for loyalty, as they had been spoiled under Queen Bamina's rule. Their arrogance frustrated Zonni, and while his advisors recommend granting them autonomy, he would much rather deal with them in another way..."
SON_governor_of_south:0 "Appoint The Lake-Farma"
SON_governor_of_south_desc:0 "The heart has been seized, and with it, Zonni now controls the bloodflow of the Great Lakes. Any trade passing north, south, east or west must go through Zar-Hay. The golden fields of Ugabi and Aoranda will feed any hungry mouths in the kingdom. The cities of Hayzeb will produce all that is needed. Only one question remains: Who shall govern all of this?"
SON_revenge:0 "Revenge"
SON_revenge_desc:0 "Mazwi must be destroyed."
SON_search_for_royal_family:0 "Search For The Royal Family"
SON_search_for_royal_family_desc:0 "Now that the Zar-Hay army has secured control of Mazwi, a thorough search for the missing hostages of the royal family can be conducted. If even a single member of the Zughe dynasty could be found, the throne of Zar-Hay would no longer be vacant. To prove that Zonni wants to power for himself, he will support the search wholeheartedly."
SON_sack_ziani:0 "The Sack Of Ziani"
SON_sack_ziani_desc:0 "Zao was once a prosperous and great city, before the Mazwians came. Now Zar-Hay shall enact its vengeance upon the accursed Mazwians and lay waste to their capital. This lesson of humility should teach them to never oppress other nations ever again! Ziani shall burn, its citizens shall be slain, its industry shall be destroyed."
SON_crush_savages:0 "Enslave The Savages"
SON_crush_savages_desc:0 "The Mozzi are proud zebras, and thus defied Zonni until the bitter end. He will teach them the price of disobedience. Their strongest and most capable stallions and mares will be enslaved and forced to fight under their new master, Zonni Zolon. Those who refuse to accept this new life of slavery will be beaten to death."
SON_governor_of_west:0 "Appoint The Mazwi-Farma"
SON_governor_of_west_desc:0 "When Zar-Hay was subjugated and its royalty taken hostage, a cruel Mazwian chieftain was appointed as governor. He heavily taxed the populace, draining it from wealth. Now the tables have turned. Mazwi shall suffer like their subjects did, under the rule of a heartless governor. Truly, can any greater humiliation be brought upon them?"
SON_the_coronation:0 "The Coronation"
SON_the_coronation_desc:0 "The sons and daughters of Zargitau have triumphed! All of the Great Lakes now kneel before them and acknowledge them as their rightful masters. Once, the Zar-Hay were humiliated slaves, but never again! On this most glorious day, Regent Zonni Zolon shall proclaim a new empire, standing proud upon the ruins of Imperial Mazwi."

SON_lessons_from_battles:0 "Lessons From Battles"
SON_lessons_from_battles_desc:0 "Zonni Zolon knows that every battle against the enemy is a chance to refine the art of war. Mistakes must be learned from and successes need to be repeated. The enemy's tactics need to be analyzed as well so weaknesses can be found and exploited. Doing all this, the army's military strategies will slowly be honed to perfection."
SON_meritocratic_promotion:0 "Meritocratic Promotion"
SON_meritocratic_promotion_desc:0 "The warriors should be commanded by those who are capable, not those who earned their position through familial connections or tribal allegiances. Zonni seeks to always promote the most distinguished soldiers into higher ranks, so they can use their combat experience to improve the army."
SON_ceaseless_drilling:0 "Ceaseless Drilling"
SON_ceaseless_drilling_desc:0 "Drilling has always been vital to warfare. Moreso in the past, when units fought in formation, but even now in the age of guns drilling can be used to improve the discipline of the army and the maneuverability of infantry. Constantly training the soldiers to march orderly and obey commands will enhance their performance."
SON_foreign_military_advisors:0 "Hire Foreign Advisors"
SON_foreign_military_advisors_desc:0 "While some may be sceptical of foreigners and their bizarre ways, there is no doubt that their methods of waging war and making weapons are far more advanced than anything in the Great Lakes. Using loot from conquests to hire experts from abroad would help greatly in modernizing the nation."
SON_formalized_recruitment:0 "Advanced Conscription Methods"
SON_formalized_recruitment_desc:0 "In modern war, every citizen is a soldier. The old methods of tribal levies and voluntary recruitment are simply too inefficient. With the help of foreign advisors, free zebras of the nation will be given basic training and drafted into the reserve pool, ready to replace casualties when needed."
SON_supply_logistic_crap:0 "Supply And Logistics"
SON_supply_logistic_crap_desc:0 "Every good commander knows that it is logistics that decide the outcome of wars. Unfortunately, the foreign advisors have discovered that the supply chains of the Zar-Hay army are archaic at best, incapable of supporting a full-scale modern force. Properly organized and well-planned logistics will help greatly in supplying the warriors."
SON_retrain_royal_guard:0 "Retrain The Royal Retinue"
SON_retrain_royal_guard_desc:0 "The most loyal warriors of the Kingdom serve the throne directly and are among the most capable fighters in all of Zar-Hay. Yet recent battles have proven that their tactics and equipment are outdated. They could be greatly improved with some rigorous training and refinement of strategies."
SON_artillery_experimentation:0 "Experimentation With Artillery"
SON_artillery_experimentation_desc:0 "So far the use of artillery in the army has been limited, but there is no doubt that long-range heavy weaponry has immense potential on the battlefield. New and more modern designs for big guns should be adopted by the gunsmiths so the infantry can have proper fire support."
SON_royal_gun_workshop:0 "Royal Cannon Workshop"
SON_royal_gun_workshop_desc:0 "While the gunsmith guilds work hard to supply the army, it is not enough. Zonni Zolon has decreed that a workshop dedicated to producing weaponry needs to be established in Zao. Unlike a traditional guild, it will employ unskilled workers to boost production rates, at expense of quality."
SON_meet_with_sorcerer:0 "Meet With The Sorcerer"
SON_meet_with_sorcerer_desc:0 "The enigmatic Chief of the Zarabara tribe, Faran, has so far shown only token support for Zonni's cause. Because he is a renowned sorcerer, his abilities could be of great use to the Kingdom. A meeting must be arranged so his aid can be secured."
SON_anti_resistance_crap:0 "Crush Resistance Movements"
SON_anti_resistance_crap_desc:0 "The defeated must learn to accept defeat instead of continuing to foolishly resist their new masters. Zonni will authorize his warriors to conduct brutal reprisals on anyone who opposes the new Zar-Hay hegemony over the Great Lakes. Under Mazwian rule, the Zar-Hay suffered greatly; now others must experience the same."
SON_support_crap:0 "Dedicated Support Units"
SON_support_crap_desc:0 "Not all warriors have to fight, as Zonni has learned. Some warriors are better off fulfilling supporting roles, such as reconnaisance or engineering, which indirectly aid their comrades. Thus specialized support companies should be formed and integrated into the army."

# Civil war 

SON_the_rightful_zuwa:0 "The Rightful Zuwa"
SON_the_rightful_zuwa_desc:0 "Azkhai Zughe may claim to be the rightful king of Zar-Hay, but he has no right to claim hegemony over the Great Lakes! Zonni is the one who led his warriors to victory, so he is the one who deserves to rule! Azkhai will either learn to bend the knee or die, like the other petty kings Zonni subjugated."
SON_question_identity:0 "Question His Identity"
SON_question_identity_desc:0 "How can anyone know for sure if Azkhai truly is a scion of the Zughe family? A mere signet ring alone proves nothing. There is a lack of convincing evidence and testification about him being the royal heir to the throne. A propaganda campaign must be launched where the truth is exposed for all to see!"
SON_appeal_to_warriors:0 "Appeal To Warriors"
SON_appeal_to_warriors_desc:0 "While many soldiers ended up being more loyal to the pretender King than the Zuwa, there are some who are more hesitant. They feel oblidged to follow the King, but in truth their loyalties lie with the brave leader who led them into countless victories. Appealing to these soldiers might convince them to switch sides again."
SON_put_slaves_to_work:0 "Put The Slaves To Work"
SON_put_slaves_to_work_desc:0 "A substantial number of slaves have been gained from the recent wars, as many prisoners of war were enslaved. Yet this expanded workforce has not yet been fully utilized. Now, during this civil war, the army must be fully supplied, so the slaves must be pressed to work harder."
SON_aid_from_advisors:0 "Aid From Advisors"
SON_aid_from_advisors_desc:0 "The foreign advisors who were hired earlier will now prove useful. Zonni will order them to the front, aiding the commanders and ensuring the loyalist forces are well organized. Their expertise will be a boon for the army, though they demand extra payment in return."
SON_forced_conscription:0 "Forced Conscription"
SON_forced_conscription_desc:0 "More soldiers are needed to decisively crush the rebellion. Yet there is a lack of experienced warriors, so once again regular zebras will have to be pressed into service to fill in the gaps in the ranks. Victory must be guaranteed at any cost."
SON_fear_campaign:0 "Fear Campaign"
SON_fear_campaign_desc:0 "Fear is what keeps rebels and traitors in check. Despite the terrible things Zonni had done, many weren't afraid enough of him and joined the King in his rebellion. Clearly, he simply didn't go far enough. New acts of terror must be conducted to teach the enemies what will happen to those who resist."
SON_he_shall_not_be_it:0 "He Shall Not Be It!"
SON_he_shall_not_be_it_desc:0 "The King should've accepted Zonni's offer. He was trying to be reasonable, but the King was hungry for total power, wanting to seize control of Zonni's Empire. But he shall not be King for much longer! Nobody has survived Zonni's wrath so far. Why would he be the exception?"

SON_the_rightful_king:0 "The Rightful King"
SON_the_rightful_king_desc:0 "If you are reading this, you used console commands. However, you don't deserve punishment. As an easter egg treat, I will explain the answers to Brodfeld's mystery events in the descriptions of these foci!"
SON_spread_news:0 "Spread The Word"
SON_spread_news_desc:0 "The first event is rather simple. It uses a Caesarean ROT cipher. There is a hint in the last capitalized word CLAW, which corresponds to OXMI. Using this, you can find the correct ROT cipher and use it to translate the text and the responses."
SON_liberate_prisoners:0 "Liberate Prisoners Of War"
SON_liberate_prisoners_desc:0 "The second event is more complex, using an affine cipher. What looks like a mathematical formula is actually the cipher key which can be used to decode the text. You only really need the A and B coefficients from the key to decrypt the text using a website or program."
SON_promise_freedom:0 "Promise Freedom To Slaves"
SON_promise_freedom_desc:0 "The third event confuses a lot of people despite not having encryption. This is because the riddle is extremely difficult unless you are a big astrophysics nerd, and even then it might be confusing. It describes the formation of Uranium in a supernova and the decay series of its isotopes. The answer is the mode of the final decay into lead."
SON_amnesty_for_scholars:0 "Amnesty For Scholars"
SON_amnesty_for_scholars_desc:0 "In contrast to the previous one, the fourth event is more of a simple trick question. The correct answer is quite obvious. The fifth event requires basic familiarity with the MLP franchise. When you know the characteristics and the backstories of the three princesses, the answer is once again fairly obvious."
SON_united_against_tyranny:0 "United Against Tyranny"
SON_united_against_tyranny_desc:0 "The sixth event uses various languages which need to be translated. The easiest way to do so is to simply use an online translator program, though some of the languages used are somewhat obscure. The seventh event's answer is clear if you keep in mind Kloseu is blindfolded."
SON_expose_his_crimes:0 "Expose His Crimes"
SON_expose_his_crimes_desc:0 "The eighth event is a riddle, and somewhat of a trick question. While it might seem like all answers fit, only one of them does. As a fun fact, it is based on a real Freemason legend. The theme for the allegory is the same as the answer to the parable."
SON_long_live_the_king:0 "Long Live The King!"
SON_long_live_the_king_desc:0 "By the time you reach the ninth event, you have solved all puzzles, yet are given one last chance to simply return to the normal Brodfeld path. These focus descriptions did not give direct answers, but hopefully the hints should be enough to figure everything out."

SON_the_four_oaths:0 "The Four Oaths"
SON_the_four_oaths_desc:0 "After the civil war, the undying loyalty of the Zuwa's subjects must be guaranteed. All those who serve the greatest zebra nation on Zebrica must be required to swear four fundamental oaths. These oaths summarize the primary objectives of the entire nation as a whole. Pursuing these goals will bring greatness to the Great Lakes!"

SON_negotiate_with_reem_desc:0 "While Re'emite aid has been a great boon to the nation, the economy of Zar-Hay remains underdeveloped. More of their assistance is needed, and Zonni must guarantee continued cooperation. Therefore he shall visit Re'em and ensure the current mutually beneficial relationship is maintained."
SON_urban_commercialization:0 "Urban Commercialization"
SON_urban_commercialization_desc:0 "Re'emite cities thrive thanks to a system of free trade, private ownership and economic competition. A similar economic system should be adopted in the urban centers of the Great Lakes. The Zuwa has decreed the end of tariffs in cities, the breakup of guilds and the establishment of a legal framework of property rights."
SON_rural_collectivization:0 "Rural Collectivization"
SON_rural_collectivization_desc:0 "The Re'emite countryside is divided into numerous collective communities. They share the land and work on it together, sharing the produce among themselves. Gradually adopting a similar system in the Great Lakes would fit the traditional system of clan ownership while incentivizing agricultural cooperation."
SON_striving_for_self_suffiency:0 "Striving For Self-Sufficiency"
SON_striving_for_self_suffiency_desc:0 "Exclusively relying on others is weakness, and Zar-Hay must be strong. The importance of strategic resources increases as the military is modernized, so with Re'emite aid, mines and other production facilities need to be expanded and improved. While total autarky is impossible, domestic supply is always more reliable than foreign."
SON_imperial_railway:0 "The Imperial Railway"
SON_imperial_railway_desc:0 "Railroads are the transportation method of the future. Re'emites already have experience with building them, so with their assistance a grand railway connecting Timbucktu and Zano can be constructed. It shall be a monument to the ever growing development of the Imperial Realm!"
SON_imperial_guilds:0 "The Imperial Guilds"
SON_imperial_guilds_desc:0 "The artisan caste of Zar-Hay has traditionally been divided into various craft guilds, each specializing in producing a different kind of product. But these organizations are too small and archaic for the modern age. New, state-owned and nation-wide Imperial Guilds shall be established to manage skilled labour in the name of the Zuwa."
SON_question_of_slavery:0 "The Question Of Slavery"
SON_question_of_slavery_desc:0 "A rigid caste system has always been part of Zar-Hay society, and thus slavery is an ancient tradition. Yet in these times of rapid change, the institution of slavery is being questioned. Re'em further pressures the Zuwa to abolish the "barbaric" practice. How will he resolve this difficult problem?"
SON_renovation_of_zao:0 "Renovation Of Zao"
SON_renovation_of_zao_desc:0 "Before the rise of Mazwi, Zao was a glimmering capital of the Kingdom, with thriving markets, wide streets and tall houses. Over the two centuries of foreign rule, it became a mere shadow of its former self. Now Zonni shall restore its lost glory and make it a capital worthy of an Empire!"
SON_grand_burial_mound:0 "A Grand Burial Mound"
SON_grand_burial_mound_desc:0 "It is customary for members of the aristocratic caste to construct burial mounds for themselves and their family. The one built by Zonni's father is rather small, as he was not wealthy. It is not worthy of his family name any longer, and the Zuwa has decided to construct a new burial mound, the largest one ever seen in the Great Lakes."
SON_offer_they_cant_refuse:0 "An Offer They Can't Refuse"
SON_offer_they_cant_refuse_desc:0 "The ties between Zar-Hay and Re'em have become very close over the years. So close, in fact, that there is no reason for the two to remain as separate nations. As a final culmination of this most productive relationship, Re'em will be offered the irresisitble opportunity to be annexed into the Imperial Realm."
SON_loyalty_to_the_zuwa:0 "Loyalty To The Zuwa"
SON_loyalty_to_the_zuwa_desc:0 ""With God as my witness, I solemnly swear to dedicate my life to serving the Imperial Zuwa. I shall not conspire against him or his subjects, for the sake of peace and order in the realm. I shall obey the commands of my superiors without question, knowing their wisdom to be greater than mine.""
SON_reward_the_loyal:0 "Reward The Loyal"
SON_reward_the_loyal_desc:0 "The civil war was only won thanks to the valiant efforts of those who refused to betray their Zuwa. Many gave their lives in the fight against the traitors. Those who survived however deserve to be honoured just like the spirits of those who fell. Let it be known that Zonni is generous and kind to those who serve him."
SON_council_of_generals:0 "The Council Of Generals"
SON_council_of_generals_desc:0 "The Zuwa cannot rule alone. He needs competent advisors by his side. Who could better fulfill such a role than the officers who fought by Zonni's side? They have proven themselves to be loyal and competent zebras. By establishing an advisory council of military commanders, Zar-Hay's security will be guaranteed."
SON_service_guarantees_citizenship:0 "Service Guarantees Citizenship"
SON_service_guarantees_citizenship_desc:0 "The concept of being a subject of Zar-Hay should be refined and formalized into a status of citizenship. Being an Imperial citizen would grant all basic rights and protections of the law. However, attaining it would require several years of active military service. This way, zebras will be strongly encouraged to join the army."
SON_arms_industry_crap:0 "The Imperial Arsenal"
SON_arms_industry_crap_desc:0 "To supply the ever growing Imperial Army, improved production and storage facilities will be needed for all the modern equipment required. For that purpose a grand arsenal shall be built in Anzongo. Its pre-existing industrial base will provide an excellent foundation for such a facility."
SON_reshape_identity:0 "Reshaping Identity"
SON_reshape_identity_desc:0 "Traditionally, being a Zar-Hay meant being a descendant of Zargitau. But would the tribe not be stronger if it welcomed all into its ranks? Mazwi failed because it was one tribe subjugating other tribes. Zar-Hay shall thrive, because it will be one tribe uniting all others under one banner."
SON_cultural_synthesis:0 "Cultural Synthesis"
SON_cultural_synthesis_desc:0 "The culture of the Zar-Hay cannot be allowed to stagnate or become isolated. To truly forge a greater identity, elements of other strong cultures of the Great Lakes should be integrated, so that the Zar-Hay may grow stronger as a tribe. This will make assimilation far easier as well."
SON_language_standardization:0 "Language Standardization"
SON_language_standardization_desc:0 "The Great Lakes have hundreds of languages, and even in Zar-Hay proper, there are numerous local dialects. For the sake of administration, a single official language must be established: The Zao dialect of Zar-Hay. This standardized language shall then be taught at schools across the realm."
SON_death_to_the_traitors:0 "Death To The Traitors"
SON_death_to_the_traitors_desc:0 ""With God as my witness, I solemnly swear to dedicate my life to ensure the security of the realm.

SON_police_force:0 "The Assara-Munidios"
SON_police_force_desc:0 "The recent chaos in the Great Lakes resulted in rampant crime, and honest zebras had to live in fear of ruthless criminals. Now that there is peace, there must be order as well. The Imperial Enforcers, Assara-Munidios, shall ensure laws are obeyed and evildoers are punished."
SON_some_spy_shit_idk:0 "Eyes Of The Zuwa"
SON_some_spy_shit_idk_desc:0 "The pretender King fooled Zonni and took him by surprise. In secret, he had prepared an uprising against him. This cannot be allowed to happen ever again! Spies will infiltrate society and search for any signs of treason. They will guard against foreign espionage as well. Let it be known the Zuwa has more than two eyes!"
SON_religious_pluralism:0 "Religious Pluralism"
SON_religious_pluralism_desc:0 "The Great Lakes are home to many diverse beliefs and ways of worship. Already, Zonni proclaimed tolerance, but now the equality of all religion shall be enshrined in law. Even the strange Re'emite faith shall be fully tolerated and their communities integrated."
SON_mass_education:0 "Mass Education"
SON_mass_education_desc:0 "Identity construction requires compulsory education for all citizens and their offspring. Not only that, but to truly be a strong and developed nation, countless skilled workers are needed, and the only way to acquire them is through education. Attending state-schools will be mandatory under the threat of whipping."
SON_diminished_persecution:0 "Diminished Anti-Intellectualism"
SON_diminished_persecution_desc:0 "Zuwa Zonni has been distrustful of scholars ever since the learned zebras of Timbucktu conspired against him. His advisors have constantly tried to convince him of the benefits of supporting intellectuals, yet their pleas fell on deaf ears. Until now. Zonni has finally agreed to ease up on them, to some extent."
SON_fate_of_the_caste_system:0 "Fate Of The Caste System"
SON_fate_of_the_caste_system_desc:0 "Societies of the Great Lakes have traditionally been divided into endogamous classes, as marriage between different groups was frowned upon. The caste system ensured societal harmony and maintained a rigid hierarchy, yet now its usefulness is in doubt. Perhaps it does more harm than good for the Imperial Realm?"
SON_imperial_academy:0 "The Imperial Academy"
SON_imperial_academy_desc:0 "Meritocratic promotion alone does not guarantee a large enough supply of capable individuals. Promising minds need to be cultivated and refined so they can reach their full potential. For this purpose, a dedicated educational facility will be established, staffed by capable foreign teachers."
SON_glory_to_the_army:0 "Glory To The Army"
SON_glory_to_the_army_desc:0 ""With God as my witness, I solemnly swear to dedicate my life to defending the nation against any foreign incursions. I shall answer the call when I am needed on the front. I shall never desert the army or surrender to the enemy, fighting to the death if necessary.""
SON_new_model_army:0 "New Model's New Model Army"
SON_new_model_army_desc:0 "Imperial Mazwi fell because it failed to adapt. This is why the Storm King's modern army swept it aside. New Model, a foreign officer from the distant land of Equestria, has proposed various drastic reforms to transform the Imperial Army into a truly modern fighting force, capable of repelling any invader."
SON_recruit_ugabi_officers:0 "Recruit Ugabian Officers"
SON_recruit_ugabi_officers_desc:0 "Before being utterly crushed by Zonni's army, the Ugabians had invested greatly into modernizing their military, even establishing an armoured brigade. The knowledge of former UCTA officers is valuable, and thus they should be offered redemption. Their experience with armoured warfare will be most useful."
SON_establish_air_force:0 "Flying Zebras"
SON_establish_air_force_desc:0 "A key factor in the Storm King's military success was his use of air power. Airships are already being obsoleted by new technologies which Zar-Hay should be quick to adopt. Planes need to be built, pilots need to be trained and an air base established. The new Imperial air force will soon provide vital support for the army."
SON_first_trial:0 "First Trial Of The New Army"
SON_first_trial_desc:0 "The reforms of New Model are well underway, yet the new army has yet to be tested in practice. To the east, a yeti warlord carved out a realm of his own in the chaos following the collapse of Mazwi and the death of the Storm King. Securing the eastern border of Zar-Hay would be an excellent military exercise for the army."
SON_land_of_dervishes:0 "The Land Of The Dervishes"
SON_land_of_dervishes_desc:0 "To the east remain the successors of the once mighty realm of Hyenia, who suffered under the Storm King much like Mazwi did. Yet they have rebuilt their strength and pose a potential threat to the eastern border of the Imperial Realm. They must submit under Zonni's authority. Otherwise, the desert dogs cannot be trusted."
SON_fortify_borders:0 "Fortify The Borders"
SON_fortify_borders_desc:0 "With all the land the Zuwa has rightfully taken, Zar-Hay now borders many foreign nations that may become enemies. The new frontiers must be secured, so they are not lost as easily as they were seized. Thousands of labourers will be put to work to construct countless defensive structures across the Imperial border."
SON_elixir_of_life:0 "Elixir Of Life"
SON_elixir_of_life_desc:0 "The Imperial Realm has been built entirely around the Zuwa. Yet he is not immortal, and has no heir. He fears that all the work he has done will be reduced to ashes, if his future children squabble over inheritance. But if he would never perish, then such a thing would never happen. Surely there is a cure for death?"
SON_pacify_the_south:0 "Pacify The South"
SON_pacify_the_south_desc:0 "The successors of the Storm King were embroiled in a civil war for many years. This made them weak and disunited, unable to pose a threat to their neighbours. But it would not last forever. The rise of another despoiler like the Storm King must be prevented at all costs! The yeti must be crushed swiftly before it is too late."
SON_demand_ovingoland:0 "Demand Ovingoland"
SON_demand_ovingoland_desc:0 "During the chaos of Mazwi's collapse, thousands upon thousands of refugees fled northward from the Great Lakes region. They settled in the sparsely populated land known as Ovingoland. They have no interest in going back to their homes, but this does present an excellent justification to secure Zar-Hay's northern frontier."
SON_secure_the_west:0 "Secure The West"
SON_secure_the_west_desc:0 "The Imperial Realm's western land border has become long, yet it could be made much shorter. It is a strategic necessity to invade the Saddle Arabian splinter states of the Riseian peninsula, before they fall under the control of potentially hostile powers. The west must be secured, so the Realm is safe from all cardinal directions."
SON_create_navy_crap:0 "Establish The Imperial Navy"
SON_create_navy_crap_desc:0 "Once Zar-Hay was a landlocked state, but no more. Vast stretches of coastline have been acquired and naval trade routes established, which now need to be defended from potential enemy attacks. Mere river canoes are no longer enough: A proper oceanic navy is needed, with modern vessels made of steel."
SON_ozymandias:0 "Look On My Works, Ye Mighty, And Despair!"
SON_ozymandias_desc:0 "Zuwa Zonni has made his mark on the history of the world. He took the small and impoverished realm of Zar-Hay and forged it with fire and blood into a mighty and vast Imperial Realm, becoming one of the major powers of Zebrica. He can rest well knowing that his legacy will endure for countless generations."

SON_crush_the_rebels:0 "Crush The Rebels"
SON_crush_the_rebels_desc:0 "Unlike Zonni, Meynsata is a warrior of honour. But even she has little tolerance for traitors and rebels, especially when they see her as a weakling. While she understands their bitterness about Zonni's reign, she hoped they would've given her a chance. But they did not. Now, they shall regret it."
SON_promise_reform:0 "Promise Reform"
SON_promise_reform_desc:0 "Despite some token reforms such as abolishing slavery, the conditions for the lower classes remained poor. Meynsata intends to improve their situation, not only out of empathy but to secure the stability of her uncertain reign. She will promise widespread social reforms to curb revolutionary support."
SON_reform_admin:0 "Reorganize Administration"
SON_reform_admin_desc:0 "The system of governorates established by Zonni proved to be cumbersome, and gave far too much power and influence to the appointed governors. A more sustainable system needs to be created. The large governorates will be carved up into numerous smaller provinces. The current governors will all be dismissed."
SON_end_repression:0 "End The Repression Of Scholars"
SON_end_repression_desc:0 "Ever since the conquest of Timbucktu, Zonni distrusted scholars and saw them as enemies of the state. Now that he is gone, there is no need to be excessively paranoid. The Zuwa commands that all unjust prosecution of intellectuals shall be ended immediately. She also formally apologizes for their previous treatment."
SON_reemite_autonomy:0 "Grant Autonomy To Re'em"
SON_reemite_autonomy_desc:0 "The Re'emites did much to help the Imperial Realm, yet received nothing in return. Instead, Zonni took away their precious liberty and annexed them directly into his personal domain. This injustice shall now be undone, and the Re'emites will be rewarded for their faithful service to Zar-Hay."
SON_revise_the_oaths:0 "Revise The Oaths"
SON_revise_the_oaths_desc:0 "The four oaths that formed the backbone of Zonni's rule were regarded as draconian and authoritarian. While their core principles were not flawed, the wording of the oaths was often criticised. The oaths should be revised so the Zuwa's subjects are more willing to fulfill them."
SON_trade_policy:0 "Formalize Trade Policy"
SON_trade_policy_desc:0 "Zonni never cared much for economic legislation and left most such matters to his advisors. As such, a clear national policy on trade with foreign countries was never established. Meynsata seeks to revise this, despite lacking any economic knowledge as well. She will consult her advisors before making a decision."
SON_end_the_experiment:0 "End The Experiment"
SON_end_the_experiment_desc:0 "Zonni had a grand ambition of uniting the disparate tribes of the Great Lakes into a single superculture, and he was partially successful. Yet policies of forced cultural assimiliation have assimilated many Imperial subjects, and appeasing them is necessary to maintain integrity of the realm. Therefore no further programs of social engineering shall be conducted."
SON_estates_of_the_realm:0 "Form The Great Assembly"
SON_estates_of_the_realm_desc:0 "The Imperial Mazwi of the past had a deliberative assembly, the Gbara, where leading members of Mazwian clans could vote on political matters. A similar governmental body would be very useful to Meynsata, so she can leave drafting of policies to the nobility, while she herself can focus on defending the nation."
SON_zonnis_legacy:0 "Zonni's Legacy"
SON_zonnis_legacy_desc:0 "With Meynsata's reforms, more and more zebras dare to speak out negatively about Zonni and his deeds. He has become a controversial figure, and his legacy is being questioned. How should he be remembered by the future generations? It is up to Meynsata to decide how history books will be written."

### Decisions ###

SON_reemite_support_decisions_category:0 "Re'emite Support"
SON_reemite_support_decisions_category_desc:0 "Zonni Zolon has proclaimed himself to be the protector of Re'em and expects something in return from the Re'emites. However, they are only willing to aid him if they support his cause. Thus, Zonni needs to do what he can to appease them and avoid actions that may upset them.\n\nCurrently, Re'emite support is [Root.SON_reemite_support_dynamic_loc].\n\nSecuring control of §gRe'emite enclave§! states and militarily aiding Re'em will increase support, while committing §Rimmoral acts§! will decrease support."
SON_support_reem:0 "Send Warriors To Re'em"
SON_support_reem_desc:0 "Re'em is a small country and could always benefit from having more soldiers in its army. They have the guns, so we can provide the warriors. This way, we show we are eager to defend Re'em. Convincing the chieftains to send their zebras abroad is not easy, however, and requires persuasion."
SON_literacy_program:0 "Re'emite Literacy Program"
SON_literacy_program_desc:0 "The Re'emites are literate folk, with the secrets of reading being widely known in their nation. We can request them to launch literacy programs in Zar-Hay to share their secrets with our subjects. A literate populace is a more capable and productive populace, after all."
SON_improve_society:0 "Re'emite Development Aid"
SON_improve_society_desc:0 "Zar-Hay was once a prosperous nation, but decades of Mazwian occupation have drained the nation's wealth, and the Storm King only made things worse. Now our nation is backwards, but with the help of the Re'emites, Zar-Hay society may develop and slowly begin to industrialize."
SON_alleviate_poverty:0 "Re'emite Poverty Relief"
SON_alleviate_poverty_desc:0 "Many free farmers and artisans have been struggling to make ends meet due to economic instability in the Great Lakes. While our economy recovers, the Re'emites can provide emergency aid to those in need, hopefully enough so they can get back on their hooves."
SON_recover_from_storm:0 "Re'emite Reconstruction Committee"
SON_recover_from_storm_desc:0 "The Storm King ravaged half of Zebrica, including Zar-Hay and Re'em. While both countries suffered, Re'em can more quickly recover with their more developed nation. Zar-Hay, however, could benefit greatly from their help. While lost artifacts may never be recovered, what was destroyed can now be rebuilt."

SON_expand_admin_to_CZR:0 "Integrate Zwadai"
SON_expand_admin_to_CZR_desc:0 "The newly taken and integrated lands to the east were formerly part of Alwani. Thus, for historical and geographical reasons, it would be best to assign the eastern provinces of Zwadai into the jurisdiction of the Zubia-Farma, so they can administer the region freely."
SON_hyena_autonomy:0 "Grant Autonomy To Hyenas"
SON_hyena_autonomy_desc:0 "Hyenan culture and administrative structure are alien to Zar-Hay, and local resistance to foreign rule is strong. Full integration thus seems impossible. However, thanks to policies of religious pluralism, it would be easy to establish autonomous theocratic states governed by hoof-picked Qaylidi individuals. This would help maintain order in the region."
SON_integrate_zwahile:0 "Integrate The Zwahile Coast"
SON_integrate_zwahile_desc:0 "The zebras of the south once lived under Mazwi's dominion like Zar-Hay did. However, they suffered under yeti oppression for many years instead of ever gaining independence. Now they have welcomed the warriors of Zar-Hay as liberators and are willing to embrace northern rule."
SON_establish_yeti_protectorate:0 "Establish The Yeti Protectorate"
SON_establish_yeti_protectorate_desc:0 "The savage yeti of the south have been subjugated, but not truly pacified. They need to be properly demilitarized and disarmed, yet at the same time given limited self-governance to minimize unrest. Efforts will be made to ensure there is never another Storm King."
SON_expand_admin_to_MKS:0 "Integrate Ovingoland"
SON_expand_admin_to_MKS_desc:0 "Ovingoland has been liberated from foreign rule, and now its zebras can be placed under the rule of the Zubia-Farma. They will ensure the northern border of the nation remains secure."
SON_establish_western_protectorate:0 "Establish The Western Protectorate"
SON_establish_western_protectorate_desc:0 "The horses of the west have been subjugated, but they have never been under zebra rule. Direct administration of the region would likely prove to be difficult. For this reason, a military protectorate shall be established. It will have full control over all military affairs, but will leave the locals with domestic autonomy."

### Events ###

zarhay.1.t:0 "The Chiefs Arrive"
zarhay.1.d:0 "Chief Quaggo arrived at the capital of Zao accompanied by his retinue of advisors and servants. He comfortably lied on his palanquin as his slaves carried it through the busy streets of the capital. He was not the only chief in town, clearly, as he saw many other chiefs and their entourages on his way to the Royal Palace.\n\nAfter they arrived, Quaggo got down from his seat and ordered his servants to do what he had told them to do earlier. The courtyard of the palace, located on the shore of Lake Zao, was filled with the many chiefs of Zar-Hay who were all chattering with one another. Soon enough, Quaggo himself would chatter as he saw his good friend, Chieftess Amzina. They exchanged formal pleasantries before engaging in more serious discussion.\n"What do you think the Regent is up to?" Quaggo asked from the mare adorned in gold.\n"He'll gather us in a room so he can kill us all at once, then seize total control," Amzina said with a smirk.\nQuaggo narrowed his eyes. "Very funny. I wanted to have a serious talk with you."\n"Fine then. To be honest, I'm not sure what to expect. One way or another, he will want to secure his rule."\n"I suppose we shall see. Earlier, I told my servants to do some investigating, just in case Zonni is plotting something God-forsaken."\n"You're being paranoid, silly. As always."\n"How can we trust him? He is half-Mazwian."\nAmzina rolled her eyes. "Let's just go to the meeting and see what happens, alright?""
zarhay.1.a:0 "Wonder what he's up to?"

zarhay.2.t:0 "Zonni's Dream"
zarhay.2.d:0 "A royal slave came out of the palace, beating a djembe drum with his hoof. The chiefs in the courtyard went silent and turned to look. Then Zonni appeared, eyeing at the crowd of chiefs closely, as if he was trying to read their thoughts, and walked up to a raised dais in front of the palace. There was a golden seat on it, but only Kings and Queens could sit there, so Zonni simply stood alongside it. He then addressed the gathered aristocrats.\n\n"Esteemed chiefs of Zar-Hay! I have summoned you here for a good reason. I have a dream, and to fulfill it, I need your unquestionable loyalty. It is not just any dream, but a dream of making Zar-Hay a truly mighty Kingdom! Long have we been subjugated, treated like slaves no matter what caste we belonged to, extorted and robbed by foreigners. We have lost our glory, our wealth and even our royalty. All this is disheartening, but I refuse to be disheartened! We should not simply sit idly as a golden opportunity presents itself. The Sky Stallion has paved the way to redeem ourselves; all we must do is walk down this sacred path. That is what I intend to do.\n\nThe Mazwian Empire has collapsed. The Storm King is no more. Now there is a power vacuum in the Great Lakes, which lies fractured and weak. Now is our chance to strike with our warriors, to forge a mighty empire surpassing Mazwi in its glory. This way, the Zar-Hay will no longer be slaves, but masters forever!"\n\nThe chiefs looked at each other quietly. Then, one of them began stomping the ground with their hooves. This began to spread as more and more chiefs showed their support for Zonni and his dream. In the end, even sceptics like Quaggo couldn't help but follow the herd and do the same.\n\nWhen Zonni saw this, he grinned. Finally, the chiefs were on his side."
zarhay.2.a:0 "We shall become great!"

zarhay.3.t:0 "A Wandering Warrior"
zarhay.3.d:0 "It seemed word of Zonni's ambitions had spread quickly, because a warrior claiming to come from a distant land requested audience with the Regent. Zonni, always in need of capable soldiers, agreed to meet him.\n\nThe warrior introduced himself as Ture Sylla and said he had fought under many rulers over the years in return for pay. Now he offered his experience and skill to Zonni, because he believed he would be victorious in the coming wars of unification, and wanted to be on the winning side.\n\nZonni was very tempted by this offer, but he wondered what the chiefs would think if he allowed a foreigner to lead their troops into battle? Perhaps it wasn't worthwhile, as he didn't want to lose their trust. Then again, a competent leader like Ture Sylla was just what he needed to aid him in his conquests."
zarhay.3.a:0 "He will be useful to us."
zarhay.3.b:0 "We have no need for him."

zarhay.4.t:0 "Ancestral Shame"
zarhay.4.d:0 "The speech had been successful and Zonni had gained the loyalty of the chiefs. As long as he would lead the army into battle to subjugate Zar-Hay's neighbours, the chiefs were willing to support him.\n\nAfter the feast following the meeting, Zonni left the city proper and travelled alone to a large field. There were many grassy mounds there, where the Kings and Queens and mighty chiefs lied entombed forever. He walked past them, to the burial ground of lesser chiefs, to the grave of his late father.\n\nHe sat on the ground and mumbled a quiet prayer to his ancestors, then began to speak to his father.\n"It appears as if I have finally gained their trust, father. But I know I have not. They are merely giving me another chance to prove that I truly am a Zar-Hay. But it is ridiculous, is it not? I had to promise so much to gain so little. And even if I succeed, will they accept me? Or will they still reject me, refusing to trust me because of my mother?"\nHe let out a deep sigh. "Sometimes I wonder why you married a Mazwian mare. It has brought our family nothing but shame and trouble. Perhaps it was just blind, foolish love. Or a gamble, which would've paid off had the Mazwian Empire not utterly collapsed. Either way, I do not judge you, father. I just wish I knew why, that is all."\nThere was a gust of wind. His father was answering, but he wasn't sure he understood. Perhaps his father was ashamed to tell the full truth?\n"I apologize for my curiosity. Don't feel pressured to answer. I will still love you, father, no matter what happens. And I promise to you, I will restore our family's lost honour. I will bring judgement upon our enemies. Our family won't have petty chiefs anymore but... an Emperor."\nWind howled in the darkness as the sun set. Zonni took this as a warning. "I will be careful, don't worry. I am no weakling anymore. Once I have gained total victory, I will return. I promise."\nHe humbly prostrated himself before the grave, and the wind calmed, becoming a pleasant breeze."
zarhay.4.a:0 "Once I come back, I will be a true Zar-Hay."

zarhay.5.t:0 "The Praise-Singers"
zarhay.5.d:0 "Fassa Balleke was a famed griot, whose ancestors had been in the court of the Zar-Hay monarch. But ever since the Mazwian invasion, they had lived in exile, wandering the land and entertaining countless chiefs and petty kings. When the Regent of Zar-Hay offered her a position in his court, she was at first sceptical, as griots traditionally served rulers, not mere regents. But in these tumultuous times, she couldn't simply refuse a job offer like that.\n\nWhen she arrived at the Royal Palace, she quickly realized she wasn't the only griot who had been invited there. Some of the griots she recognized, yet others appeared obscure and unpopular. The Regent had cast a very wide net in his search for griots.\n\nThen Zonni came out to meet them. "Greetings, honoured griots, and welcome to the Royal Palace! These walls have not heard your music or song in so many years, yet this shall now change. I know some of you may be wondering why a mere Regent would have a need for you. No, I do not intend to become King. However, I do need your aid. You see, I need popular support for my grand unification campaigns which I have planned. I need talented speakers and entertainers like you to spread the word among the commoners, glorifying my rule, drumming up support for my cause and recording my deeds for the future generations. In return, I will offer you a generous share of the spoils of war. I swear on the Spirits that you will become rich."\n\nTo some it might have seemed like an unpleasant job, but for Fassa it was nothing out of the ordinary. Such was the usual duty of the griot caste. However, in her heart she feared that the Regent's gamble would fail, that he would be defeated and his griots enslaved. But as she looked around the Palace, she felt like she was finally back home. She prayed to God, and stepped forth to accept Zonni as her new patron."
zarhay.5.a:0 "Our fates are now entwined."

zarhay.6.t:0 "The Wind-Singers"
zarhay.6.d:0 "Zonni uncovered his head as he entered a hallowed sanctuary of the Wind-Singers. The white-robed priests inside nodded in greeting. "We have expected you, scion of Zolon," the eldest of the priests said.\nZonni raised an eyebrow. "How? I did not inform you of my arrival."\n"The Spirits told us. They also said you've come to see the future."\n"Yes. If the Spirits told you that, then clearly I can trust you to conduct a divination and reveal my fate to me."\nOne of the other priests shook her head. "Fate is fickle. Visions are unclear. Future is always in flux."\n"The further away we look, the harder it becomes to see," the eldest priest added. "But perhaps the Spirits are in a generous mood today."\n"I pray it is so," Zonni replied. "Please, tell me if my dream is doomed to fail, if I should bother waging war in the first place. That is all I wish to know."\nThe priests looked at one another, then nodded. "Then come, to conduct a proper divination we must do so in the open," the eldest said.\n\nThe zebras left the sanctuary and walked to a nearby open field. They spread out a pure white cloth with painted markings and symbols on the grass. One of the priests had brought with him a pouch, which he gave to the eldest Wind-Singer. The priests stood and waited for the wind to pick up, and when there was a gust of wind, the priests hummed and the eldest one threw out the contents of the pouch into the wind. Bone fragments, gemstones, amulets and carved dice were scattered by the wind onto the cloth. As the wind died down, so did the humming of the priests. The eldest one then sat down in front of the cloth and began to study the pattern created by the objects.\n"What do you see, elder?" Zonni asked, curious and eager.\nThe eldest furrowed his brow. "I see... a dead lion," he said and pointed at several items on the cloth. "And a white-backed vulture, swooping in to feast on its flesh."\nZonni's eyes widened. "I see what this means. The lion is Mazwi and I am the vulture!"\nThe eldest narrowed his eyes. "But then a hidden hunter appears from the bush and scares the vulture away, claiming the lion's remains."\nZonni frowned. "Hrm. Sounds like I need to be careful, or I will lose it all."\n"You are interpreting the signs well enough," the eldest said. "But remember what was said. The future is not set in stone. The vulture may yet feast on the lion."\nZonni nodded, and smiled confidently."
zarhay.6.a:0 "It is a good sign, thank God."

zarhay.7.t:0 "New Tools Of Death"
zarhay.7.d:0 "Gunsmiths were among the most respected members of the artisan caste, capable of assembling intricate weaponry from metal. Before, they had made fine swords of steel, but in recent decades they had learned to make muskets instead. In this time of rapid change, they would have to adapt yet again.\n\nZonni entered the courtyard of the gunsmith's workshop, where the local guild masters and their students were already waiting. On his back, Zonni carried a weapon which immediately attracted the attention of the smiths. He stopped in front of the audience members, who bowed in respect, and took out the gun. "Greetings, esteemed gunsmiths. Do any of you know what this is?"\nThe gunsmiths looked at each other in doubt. "Is it some kind of musket?" one of them asked.\nZonni chuckled. "Almost correct. This, my friends, is a rifle. Allow me to demonstrate how it works." He motioned to his servants who brought out a blindfolded female prisoner into the courtyard, guiding it to stand in front of a mudbrick wall. It was a slave who had tried to kill its owner and had thus been condemned to death.\n\nZonni stood up on his hind legs, loaded the rifle, took aim and fired. A loud bang echoed in the courtyard as the slave dropped dead in an instant. The gunsmiths looked in awe, their mouths wide open. Zonni smiled as he turned to face them again. "As you can see, it is far more accurate than a musket and produces less smoke. I have spent a fortune acquiring these from a dealer in Tobuck. Your task will be to dismantle and study this weapon, so we may learn to make it ourselves. I trust you will do a fine job in service to the Kingdom, and receive a handsome reward in return." Zonni gave the rifle to the nearest gunsmith, who prostrated herself on the ground, deeply grateful."
zarhay.7.a:0 "May God bless these weapons."

zarhay.8.t:0 "Zonni Zolon Vows To Protect Re'emites"
zarhay.8.d:0 "In a strange turn of events, Zonni Zolon, the Crown Regent of the Kingdom of Zar-Hay, has sworn to protect Re'emites from any outside aggression. This pledge of protection extends to any Re'emite minorities living within territory under Zar-Hay control.\n\nHowever, he was quick to make it clear that he is not doing this out of the goodness of his heart, and said Re'em would have to provide his nation aid in return. This help did not have to be military in nature, as Re'em could help develop the underdeveloped country in return and work to eliminate poverty. [Root.GetLeader] has accepted this, as Re'em has already done much to aid the zebras of the Great Lakes. Besides, if Zonni grows stronger, he will be a powerful ally for Re'em, ensuring its survival in the future."
zarhay.8.a:0 "Thank you..?"

zarhay.9.t:0 "A Worthy Sacrifice"
zarhay.9.d:0 "Zonni had ordered a sacrificial ceremony to be held by the priesthood of Zao in preparation for the wars he was about to wage. The Wind-Singers got to work and Zonni assumed he did not need to get involved himself. However, one of the priests approached him and requested him to decide what would be sacrificed. Traditionally, it had been the decision of the Kings and Queens, but as Zonni was the royal regent, the responsibility was now on his shoulders.\n\nZonni pondered deeply, for the decision was vital. If the right sacrifice was not made, the spirits would be displeased and cast a curse on him. On the other hoof, if he chose correctly, then the spirits would bless his ambitions and further ensure he'd prevail on the battlefield. The most important spirits to appease were Zabera, grandfather of war, Muawri, god of the hunt, and Zargitau, the founder of Zao and the progenitor of Zar-Hay. The custom offering consisted of fresh kola nuts, divided into four lobes. Zabera was known to be especially fond of the bittersweet seeds. But Zonni was unsure if this was a fitting sacrifice, as the coming wars weren't a mere skirmish or raid, and possibly required a greater sacrifice. Dogs were favourite animals of Zargitau and close companions of Muawri, so they'd be pleased by such a offering. Yet even this did not feel like enough. Perhaps a grand sacrifice was in place, to truly impress the spirits and show them that Zonni was in great need of their blessing? For that, 444 slaves would suffice. It was a sacred number and ritual killings of slaves were acceptable in Zar-Hay society. But perhaps it was too much...\n\nEventually, Zonni finally made the decision and revealed it to the Wind-Singers."
zarhay.9.a:0 "Offer kola nuts."
zarhay.9.b:0 "Offer the life of a dog."
zarhay.9.c:0 "Offer the lives of 444 slaves."

zarhay.10.t:0 "Gathering The Warriors"
zarhay.10.d:0 "As far as Zonni was concerned, every capable zebra in the Kingdom was a potential soldier. As the clouds of war were gathering, so too would the levied troops of Zar-Hay. They would provide crucial support for the more professional royal retinue and the chieftains' personal armies. Zonni had done much work in preparation to organize the mustering of soldiers, hiring administrators, establishing a regional command hierarchy and bribing the right zebras to ensure it would go smoothly. He was not inventing everything new, of course, just renovating the old levy system of the Kingdom that had not been used since before the Mazwians had ended their independence centuries ago.\n\nSoon, the war drums were beaten across the nation and zebras were called to arms. Many began gathering in the centers of their towns and villages where Zonni's commanders were overseeing the mustering. Each zebra brought their own equipment and rations, many armed with crude muskets, swords, spears or bows. Units were formed and the conscripts were assigned officers from the ranks of the aristocracy. Then these units would march to Zao, where the levies would swear allegiance to the Regent.\n\nZonni was proud to see thousands of soldiers gathering in the capital. The mustering had gone well, and while many villages had now lost able-bodied workers, they'd be back home eventually. Dead or alive. What mattered to Zonni was that his army was now strong enough to face the challenges ahead of them."
zarhay.10.a:0 "Soon, it begins..."

zarhay.11.t:0 "Righteous Flames"
zarhay.11.d:0 "The false prophet was escorted to a stake by Zonni's warriors. He was tied up to the wooden pole, next to his most dedicated followers who would share his fate. Unlike them, however, the prophet did not seem afraid. His face was emotionless, his eyes determined. This stallion did not fear death, it seemed.\n\nZonni approached him, looking at the fanatic with disdain. "Speak if you will, for soon you will no longer be able to do so."\n"I have nothing to say to you; but I ask God to forgive you for your sins, for you are misguided."\n"Misguided? You are the one who is misguided! You wished to force the zebras of the Great Lakes to all follow your ways of worship, regardless of their own traditions."\nThe prophet ignored him as he closed his eyes. "I have nothing to fear. The flames cannot hurt me. I am with God, and God is with me."\nThe Regent grimaced, almost in disgust. "If God was with you, then why did you lose?"\n\nHe received no response as the prophet continued to mumble his prayers. Zonni rolled his eyes and turned to his warriors, who were holding lit torches. "The time has come! Let us get rid of these lost souls. They are beyond redemption."\n\nThe soldiers nodded and ignited the piles of dry branches at the base of each stake. The fires spread quickly, engulfing the prophet and his followers. One by one, they each began screaming from pain, except for the prophet who was completely silent even as his coat began burning. But in the end, he too screamed and begged for Zonni's forgiveness. The Regent simply glared back. Now he was the one who refused to respond."
zarhay.11.a:0 "The head of the snake has been cut."

zarhay.12.t:0 "A Meeting In Zarabara"
zarhay.12.d:0 "As Zonni Zolon entered the dwelling of the chieftain, he was immediately met with pungent fumes that filled the air. One of Faran's servants advised him to cover his muzzle while he was inside, as the Chief had recently been brewing potions. The Regent did so and followed the servant as she guided him to the meeting chamber.\n\nThere, Faran was already waiting, seated on a cushion with a stoic face. Zonni sat down in front of him and the Chief offered him kola nuts, a traditional gift of hospitality. The Regent humbly accepted.\n"You know why I come here, so let us bypass the formalities. How can I convince you to provide your skills of sorcery in service to the Kingdom?"\nFaran said nothing, simply glaring at him. Zonni frowned and almost took it as an insult, before Faran suddenly burst into laughter. "He who asks, shall receive!"\nZonni blinked in confusion, then regained his composure. "Well, that is what I am doing now."\n"But what do you ask for? I have many skills that can be used in many ways. Are you in need of my potions, or my knowledge of the arcane?"\nZonni raised an eyebrow. "Can you not provide both?"\n"Do not be greedy, despite your status. You may ask for one thing, and you shall receive it. What will it be?" Faran grinned.\n\nThe Regent pondered for a while before answering. Faran's potions would be greatly useful, empowering the warriors of the army, but his abilities as a sorcerer could be used to empower the state. Part of him wanted to simply demand both, but even he did not dare to arouse the wrath of a zebra who could cast a curse to break his back."

zarhay.13.d:0 "Soon after Zonni Zolon had marched into Timbucktu as a victor, the university of Timbucktu launched a smear campaign against him, likely funded by the city's merchants. Pamphlets were spread among the literate populace, exposing Zonni Zolon as an illiterate, half-Mazwian tyrant, claiming he also dabbled in forbidden sorcery.\n\nWhen Zonni heard of this, his blood begun to boil. While the claim about him beign a sorcerer was a lie, everything else was truth. The foolish scholars used the truth as a weapon, striking him where it hurt. As a result of the campaign, the populace of Timbucktu were encouraged to resist the foreign occupier and threaten the newly established peace in the region.\n\nZonni would not stand for this. No one could mock him without facing the consequences. In his fury, he ordered the teachers and professors of the university to be rounded up and imprisoned for inciting a revolt against him. The most prominent scholars would be tortured or executed, while the university's printing presses were to be shattered with hammers and the city's libraries burned with fire. The wealth of the merchants would be confiscated so they would become beggars, unable to fund any resistance. Zonni's faithful warriors obeyed and carried out his commands. A dark pillar of smoke soon rose from the heart of Timbucktu.\n\nIf they wanted him to be a monster, then he'd become one."

When Zonni Zolon launched his reprisals against the zebras of Timbucktu, Meynsata couldn't help but question his actions. Zonni was fond of her, so she was not afraid of potentially angering him.\n\nWhen Meynsata met with him and asked why he was so ruthless against the Timbucktuans, Zonni sighed and said he'd tell a story from his youth.\n"When I was a mere colt, I was weak and pathetic. Other foals saw my weakness and thus abused me, making fun of my mixed blood and trampling me with their hooves. When I told my parents about this, my Mazwian mother said that I should turn the other cheek so the Sky Stallion would see my moral superiority. Of course, that did nothing. When I returned with a bloodied muzzle, my Zar-Hay father told me to strike back with twice the fury. Even if I was weak, it did not matter. I had to show them that mistreating me would have consequences.\nSo I faced the bullies again, but when they mocked me I mocked them back, calling them sons and daughters of donkeys. They beat me, and I struck back. While I was weak, they saw I was no longer a pushover. Their bullying continued for a while until they realized that it wasn't worth it. Slowly, they even began to fear and respect me. No one has dared to bully me ever since.\nThis is why I strike back with twice the fury at anyone who mocks me or conspires against me. The bullies learned this, and now the Timbucktuans did, too."\n\nMeynsata nodded. While she still did not agree with his actions, she did understand the reasoning."

The zebra's spirit was broken, yet Zonni could sense a tiny flame of defiance as Euzegoar glared at him. The Regent stood up.\n"Your majesty, it is unfortunate that I cannot let you go free, as your supporters are... hesitant to accept defeat. Therefore I have to deal with you to dissuade their resistance."\n"Such audacity," Euzegoar spat out. "First you subjugate my subjects, then you plan to commit regicide to secure your unjust rule?"\n"My rule is just, as I have secured it with the strength of my army. Mighty empires are forged with violence and their right to rule comes from victory. As for 'regicide', well, that would require you to still be a King, wouldn't it?"\nEuzegoar's face twisted in hatred. "Truly, you have Mazwian blood in your veins, as you are bent oppression and subjugation. Fine then, deal with me as you see fit. The Storm King would be proud of your lack of mercy."\nZonni narrowed his eyes. He felt an urge to behead him immediately with his sword, but at the same time he questioned if that was the right thing to do. Killing Euzegoar would create a martyr and possibly incite further resistance. Taking him as a hostage would just make him seem even more like a Mazwian, but what about being merciful? He could spare him on the condition that he would order his supporters to lay down their arms, and could further appease him by making him governor of the north. However, Zonni was unsure if he could truly trust Euzegoar. Perhaps it'd be best to simply kill him and be done with it."

Yet Zonni cared little for the naysayers and knew that he had to establish effective governance of conquered lands to secure control over them. The annexation of Macigena had already brought dozens of additional chieftains into the ranks of the nation's aristocracy, and doing the same to the entire north would result in a decentralized administrative nightmare. No, instead, Zonni knew he'd unfortunately have to do what the Mazwians had done and assign a regional governor to manage local administration.\n\nWhile the officials did the necessary paperwork, Zonni had to decide who should receive the title of Zubia-Farma, governor of the north. It should be somezebra he could trust, who wouldn't revolt at the first sign of his weakness, but also a zebra who was competent enough to handle the management of such a large area. This narrowed down the list of potential candidates greatly, as Zonni did not trust many zebras.\n\nIn the end, he seriously considered only two possible candidates: One was Zogon, the drillmaster of the army and a former master of slaves, while the other was Chieftess Amzina, known for making her tribe prosper. Zogon was loyal beyond any doubt, but wasn't as competent of a manager as Amzina would be. Meanwhile Amzina's power and influence was already great, so empowering her even more was potentially a bad idea.\n\nAfter a while, Zonni made the final decision and hoped he would not regret it."

zarhay.17.d:0 "After Zonni's brave warriors had captured the Gelon-Zornu royalty, he had considered to simply take them hostage, as he had no interest in keeping them around as puppets like the Mazwians had. When Mazwi was weak, they had simply seized the opportunity to declare independence, so clearly they could not be trusted. Yet as the word spread, zebras in Zao began to talk how Zonni was now acting like a Mazwian, taking subjugated rulers hostage, drawing comparisons to what had happened to Zar-Hay's royal family. This made Zonni's blood boil as despite refusing to leave the Zefuwa alone, he was still being compared to the Mazwians. It's like the zebras refused to forget his heritage.\n\nIn a fit of anger, he changed his plans to a more brutal direction, to prove that he would not mimic the accursed Mazwians in any way. He would extinguish the Zefuwa dynasty, thus removing any threat of disloyalty from Gelon-Zornu. Yet he felt pity on the former Mai, Gounama, who was an old zebra. Therefore he decided to leave him alone, and instead get rid of his heirs, so when he'd die of age, no one would inherit his claims to the throne.\n\nAll of his sons, daughters, cousins and other close relatives were rounded up in a countrywide search. They were then brought to Zao, where Zonni ordered the preparation of a sacrificial ritual. He claimed the gods would be pleased with an offering of royal blood, though the Wind-Singers were sceptical. Nevertheless, they obeyed, and soon enough a grand ritual was held where every heir of the Zefuwa dynasty was sacrificed to the Spirits.\n\nIt was said Gounama mourned for seven days before passing away, his heart broken from shock and despair."

zarhay.18.d:0 "When Zonni heard that the defeated city-states of Hayzebland had delivered something resembling an ultimatum to him, he was baffled. Their lands had been seized, the Regent of Zar-Hay was their new overlord... and they thought they could not only bargain, but make demands? It was truly outrageous. Zonni immediately began preparations to raze the prosperous cities, but was stopped by his advisors, who suggested he should consider accepting the demands.\n\nChieftess Meynsata said that doing so would appease the city-states and ensure their loyalty, proving to everyone that Zonni had a merciful side as well. She said that while the city-states would be less exploitable due to an autonomous status, less effort would need to be made to quell local resistance.\n\nAs Zonni trusted Meynsata, he seriously considered doing what she asked. But in his heart burned a fire of vengeance, as he felt like he had been insulted. If he would not punish them, wouldn't that just encourage more zebras to insult him? It was a choice between rationality and emotion, and Zonni struggled to decide what to do."

zarhay.19.t:0 "Blessed Of Baru Koda"
zarhay.19.d:0 "With the south, Zonni faced the same problem as with the north: He needed a governor to lead the administration of the region. However, the northern region of Zubia was smaller, had less population and the only notable urban center was Timbucktu. The south was different. It was larger, had much more population, and many prosperous and influential cities. Any governor would have to be not only competent, but loyal, as a rebellious governor could easily use the vast resources of the region to organize a revolt. The south was also blessed by Baru Koda, the Spirit of millet, and thus only a worthy individual could rule the land in Her divine name.\n\nWhile Zonni considered Zogon and Amzina again, as he had before, he also thought of another option. Through his Re'emite contacts, he learned of a royal prince of Ugabi known as Amanyi. He had studied soil chemistry in Re'em for many years and did not care much for being a ruler, lacking any ambition. When Zonni learned of this, he immediately sent his most loyal zebras of the royal retinue to find and retrieve Amanyi, as he felt like he could be the perfect governor.\n\nEventually, the prince was brought before Zonni and made kneel before him.\n"Prince Amanyi, it is good to see you in one piece! I was afraid you'd resist my warriors, but it seems you are willing to comply when necessary."\nAmanyi stood back up, but did not lift his head much and sighed. "Indeed. What do you want from me? Have I committed some crime?"\nZonni laughed. "No, no, you've done nothing wrong! But you can do many things right. You see, I am in need of a capable zebra who can govern your homeland in my stead. And you would fulfill this duty admirably, I believe."\nAmanyi seemed hesitant. "While... I am honoured by this offer, I do not share your belief. I am a student first and foremost. Besides, I would rather live as a free zebra than as a servant to a foreign conqueror."\nZonni's smile vanished. "I see. In that case, I have other options for the position as well. Governors who will make sure Ugabi is drained out of anything valuable."\nAmanyi remained silent. He knew Zonni's ghastly reputation. If he refused the offer, Ugabians would suffer. Would he accept a life of servitude for the sake of his homeland?"

zarhay.20.d:0 "After a month of investigation, where Zonni's warriors looked in every possible hiding place and interrogated countless Mazwians, no members of the Zughe dynasty were found. There were few clues about their fate: After the Storm King had sacked Ziani, any captives in the Imperial Palace had broken free. It is known that King Euzegoar of Alwani had escaped this way. However, some of the captives were recaptured and even slain by Mazwian guards. A mass grave of killed prisoners was found, containing only bleached bones and tattered rags, but there was no evidence that any of them had been part of the Zughe dynasty.\n\nThere was no sign of the Royal Signet Ring either. It was a golden heirloom of the Zar-Hay monarchy that functioned both as a seal for the authentification of documents and as a way to identify the monarch. It is possible that the Storm King had taken the treasure, like he had taken so many other valuables, but King Euzegoar still had his crown as he escaped. If the Zughe family had been killed, then it is possible one of the Mazwians had stolen the ring and sold it to someone.\n\nWith a heavy heart, Zonni announced the results of the investigation to his subjects: The Regency would continue indefinitely as none of the members of the Zughe family had been found. Nevertheless, they would not yet abandon hope as no conclusive evidence had proven they were dead either."

The Storm King had laid waste to the city, burning down many buildings and looting anything of value. Yet in the years since, rebuilding had begun, and already the signs of the previous devastation were few.\n\nMazwians were tenacious like cockroaches.\n\nZonni knew he'd have to do a more thorough job than what the Storm King had done. Only then would the perfidious Mazwians learn their place in the world. His warriors were frustrated by the lack of loot in the city and thus eagerly obeyed his command to set it aflame. Soon enough, ravenous fires spread, and Zonni's soldiers slew anyone who tried to put out the flames. Thousands of zebras fled the city to the countryside, leaving behind the sick and the elderly who were left to perish in the fire. Many others failed to escape in time. The fire spread to the workshops, to the estates of the local aristocracy, to the Imperial Palace. Everything burned with equal intensity. As Zonni gazed upon the flames, he could've sworn he saw Zargitau galloping among them, trampling on burning Mazwians.\n\nIt was a beautiful sight."

Soon enough, Zonni was informed that his soldiers were unearthing and defacing the burial mounds of the Mazwian nobility. Among them was the grave of his mother.\n\nZonni immediately travelled to the scene and saw that it was true. The soldiers were busy at work, digging up graves with their shovels and loading up wooden carts full with burial treasures. It was sacrilegious. Not even the Mazwians had dared to disturb the graves of Zar-Hay chieftains. Yet Zonni did not tell them to stop. Instead, he kept walking, trying to find his mother's grave.\n\nIt was not hard to find. Her burial mound was large because she had once been a high-ranking noble. This also meant that it was among the first ones to be looted, and had already been fully emptied of anything precious. Only his mother's naked bones remained. Even the silk clothes that had covered them were now gone.\n\nZonni stood quietly. While he had little fondness for his mother, deep in his heart, he still felt outraged. He wanted to order his warriors to put back every single item they had taken and restore the burial mound. Yet he hesitated. For years he had tried to convince everyone that his Mazwian heritage did not matter. If he now suddenly displayed affection for his mother, then who would believe his words?\n\nThe wind was blowing loudly. He could hardly hear his own thoughts."

With the failure to find any members of the royal family, and with the subjugation of the entirety of the Great Lakes, the time had come to bring an end to it. Zonni already knew how: He would create a new title, the Imperial title of Zuwa, and crown himself as the supreme ruler of the Great Lakes. This way his lineage and lack of a claim would be irrelevant. The throne of the Kingdom of Zar-Hay would remain vacant, but that did not matter any longer. The age of Imperial Zar-Hay had begun.\n\nThus a lavish ceremony was prepared in Zao, where Zonni would officially be proclaimed as the Zuwa of Zar-Hay, crowned by the Wind-Singers themselves. A grand parade was held, where the soldiers triumphantly marched through the streets, displaying war trophies, loot and enslaved enemies. Every chief and governor in the new Imperial Realm was invited to the grand capital to attend the ceremonies and to swear fealty to their hegemon by kissing his hooves. While some, like Chief Quaggo, were hesitant, all of them eventually did so. In the end, Zonni was enthroned upon a resplendent golden throne made by the finest goldsmiths in Zao, and a crown made out of purple cloth by the most skilled weavers was placed upon his head.\n\nA gentle breeze outside convinced Zonni that his father was proud. He planned to visit his burial mound tomorrow, now a true Zar-Hay who had redeemed his family and restored its honour."

He had considered appointing him to govern other regions before, but that had been foolish. The west was the perfect governorship for him. Zogon would whip the Mazwians into shape, make them extract all the wealth from Buckure's mines and demand taxes that were as high as the ones the Zar-Hay had once paid to their Mazwian masters.\n\nPerhaps now the Mazwians would realize how terrible they and their ancestors had been.

Even some of the most loyal warriors and officers betrayed him.

Oppression and brutality is part of Mazwian heritage, that much is obvious. You have proven it to be true more than anyone else. Now be quick and end me, so I do not have to suffer from your presence."\nFor a while, Zonni said nothing. Quaggo was defiant until the end, and insulted him in the worst ways possible.

He had seen how deeply ingrained tribal divisions were in the Great Lakes. Despite his best attempts to appease his subjects, they would possibly never forget about his heritage. Comprehensive changes were needed to truly unify the many tribes of the region.\nZonni smiled thankfully to Quaggo. "Your words have given me food for thought. I am grateful. So grateful, in fact, that I shall spare you from sharing the grisly fate of your False King. Go, and be free."\nQuaggo stared at him in shock as the guards unshackled him. "No!" he shouted. "I will not live as a subject of a Mazwian ever again!" He galloped to the nearest window and jumped out, leaping to his doom.\nZonni lifted an eyebrow, then shrugged. "Bring the next prisoner.""

zarhay.29.t:0 "Rebellious Slaves"
zarhay.29.d:0 "A caste system had always been in place in the Great Lakes, one that tolerated widespread slavery. It was tradition, and no one dared to question it. But times were changing, and Zonni's enemy, King Azkhai, took advantage of this. He spread emancipatory rhetoric, promising to end slavery in the Great Lakes. He made sure the word spread into lands under Zonni's control, too.\n\nSoon enough, the Zuwa received reports of large-scale slave uprisings in several areas. Somehow, the slaves had gotten weapons and had formed fighting units. Yet for Zonni it was hardly a mystery. Azkhai was endangering the societal order by arming the slaves and inciting them to revolt. He was playing a dangerous game. Did he not realize that if he won the civil war, the slaves would simply turn against him?\n\nZonni was certain the slaves could be crushed easily. But Azkhai had possibly sowed the seeds of rebellion into the hearts of slaves. Seeds that might one day grow into something terrible."
zarhay.29.a:0 "Put them in their place!"

zarhay.30.t:0 "Slanderous Allegations"
zarhay.30.d:0 "When Zonni repressed those he had defeated, he never did so in secret. Yet knowledge of these acts of terror was mostly spread in rumours, which were embellished and twisted into fantastical stories about Zonni being the Scourge of God. Yet not all acts were equally notable and some rumours were entirely fabricated, so it was difficult to tell what Zonni had actually done to his enemies.\n\nThings changed with King Azkhai. Through cooperation with the victims and survivors, he learned the full truth of what Zonni had done, and began spreading the information with the help of griots, who travelled from village to village and recited everything that was known about Zonni's actions. He was exposed as a mass murderer, Kingslayer, tyrant. Evidence was made clear for all to see, leaving no doubt of the truth. Yet at the end of these speeches was a hopeful message that Zonni would face justice for his actions, if not from Azkhai, then from God.\n\nZonni was furious when he heard of this. Once again, truth was used as a weapon against him. Azkhai would pay for this, but in a way, he was thankful. Perhaps Azkhai's supporters would grow fearful of Zonni and surrender, rather than resist and face his wrath. He hoped that would be the case."
zarhay.30.a:0 "Curse him!"

zarhay.31.t:0 "Revisitation"
zarhay.31.d:0 "As soon as he was able, Zonni took a break from fulfilling his duties as Zuwa and returned to the windy fields outside Zao, to the burial mound of his father. He was proudly wearing his full regalia and was even carrying treasures stolen from distant lands. He presented the loot to his father and sat down on the ground, smiling.\n"As I promised, I have returned at long last. Not as a mere warrior-noble or Regent, but as Zuwa, Emperor of the Great Lakes!" he proclaimed.\n\nThe wind was silent.\n\nZonni's grin faltered. "No one dares to mock our family anymore, father. Our enemies faced swift justice. The honour that was lost is now fully restored!"\n\nThe wind was silent.\n\nZonni grew increasingly frustrated. "Why do you say nothing? I have done what few could ever even hope to accomplish! Chronicles now bear the name of our family which was once fading into irrelevance! What more could I possibly do?"\n\nThe wind was silent.\n\nZonni let out a deep sigh. "I understand. Conquering is easy. Ruling is not. I have to avoid sharing the fate of the Storm King. I have to create a lasting legacy for our family. And... I must unite the tribes. Now I realize, father, why you married a Mazwian mare. You did not care for petty tribal divisions. You wished for peace between the tribes, not bloodshed... I have punished the Mazwians for what they did to us, and the debt is repaid. There should no longer be a feud between us. I will make sure of it."\nThe grass around him rustled from a gentle breeze. The mighty Zuwa humbly prostrated himself before the grave."
zarhay.31.a:0 "Zar-Hay or not, it shall not matter."

zarhay.32.t:0 "A Meeting In Re'em"
zarhay.32.d:0 "While Zuwa Zonni had proclaimed himself to be the protector of Re'emites years ago, he had never visited Re'em itself. Until now. A grand procession departed Zao, travelling westwards, and crossed the border into Re'em. The Zuwa was escorted by hundreds of guards and courtiers, as well as many slaves who were carrying valuable gifts for the Re'emites.\n\nWhen the local horses saw this grand caravan, they appeared unenthusiastic. They seemed to be especially bothered by the zebra slaves, who were forced to carry heavy loads on their backs. Zonni saw this, and hoped to appeal to them by freely distributing nuggets of gold from the Buckure mines. When this appeared to have little effect, Zonni muttered a curse and ordered the caravan to continue on its way.\n\n[REE.GetLeader] and his entourage welcomed Zonni to the capital of Re'em. A ceremony was held and the two national leaders exchanged generous gifts with one another. Hospitality was important to Re'emites, so [REE.GetLeader] was more friendly to the visitors than the commoners had been. After a meal with traditional Re'emite cuisine such as wheat bread, figs, pomegranates and plentiful wine, Zonni initiated negotations with the Re'emite leader.\n\nThe Zuwa told him of the devastation caused by the recent wars and the economic underdevelopment of his nation. He was deeply grateful for previous Re'emite aid, but wanted the cooperation to not only continue, but expand. His new Imperial Realm had plenty of wealth to share with foreign friends. [REE.GetLeader] was hesistant however, and asked if Zar-Hay would continue to protect the Re'emites. Zonni assured him that was the case. Then [REE.GetLeader] asked about Zonni's questionable actions, and the continued practice of slavery, and said he wasn't sure if he wanted to help such a ruler. Zonni felt insulted, yet remained calm. He appealed to his emotions, saying how every passing minute a zebra foal died of hunger. [REE.GetLeader] said nothing. Then Zonni became frustrated, and said "Fine! We shall abolish slavery eventually. But only if you promise to aid us!"\n\nThus a deal was signed and the two leaders shook hooves. However, the tensions between the two were clear for all to see."
zarhay.32.a:0 "Together we shall prosper!"

zarhay.33.t:0 "Regarding The "Protector""
zarhay.33.d:0 "After the tense meeting with the Zuwa of Zar-Hay, [ROOT.GetLeader] couldn't help but feel like the relationship between the two nations was unequal. There was even some guilt about helping Zar-Hay in the first place, as it had committed many atrocities and was now dominating the region. Re'emite needed protection from Zar-Hay more than anything. If they refused to aid the tyrannical Empire, then they would be swiftly crushed by a furious Zuwa and his mighty army.\n\n[REE.GetLeader] still wanted to help the common populace of Zar-Hay, as they should not suffer for the actions of their monarch. But something had to be done to topple the despotic regime, before Re'em would outlive its usefulness to it.\n\n[REE.GetLeader] ordered his most trusted agents to find some kind of resistance figure who could oppose Zonni's government. Soon enough, they found a Zar-Hay mare called Nyaberi Zargey who was amassing a small but dedicated following. She was a radical and dangerous ideologue, and thus the perfect weapon to use against Zonni Zolon. After she was secretly contacted, she quickly agreed to work together with Re'em to ensure the downfall of the regime. With the newfound support, she would establish a proper political party in her homeland which would strive for the liberation of the populace from tyranny."
zarhay.33.a:0 "Let's hope she doesn't disappoint..."

zarhay.34.t:0 "A Dangerous Demagogue"
zarhay.34.d:0 "The internal security forces of the Imperial Realm recently reported of unusual activity among the lower castes. The labourers and slaves were becoming more organized and started to demand better treatment from their superiors. Some of them were accused of breaking their oaths and arrested, yet this only seemed to cause further unrest.\n\nIt appeared some zebra had been inciting the lower castes with dangerous ideas of social and economic equality. Multiple interrogations revealed the name of "Nyaberi Zargey", yet little else was known about the zebra. A country-wide search for this individual was then initiated. The Zuwa was concerned that if the head of the red snake wasn't cut quickly, it would bite and inject the nation with cursed poison."
zarhay.34.a:0 "Find this zebra at once!"

zarhay.35.t:0 "Promoting The Brave"
zarhay.35.d:0 ""If this is true, then Zanda Dongo is truly an exemplary warrior, displaying all martial virtues of the Zar-Hay," Zonni told Meynsata.\n"I assure you it is true," she said. "He always fought near the frontlines, leading his comrades into bold charges. He also looked for turncloaks in his unit and reported them to his superiors. Zargitau would be proud of him."\n"I will have him promoted at once. Such courageous and loyal zebras deserve to be rewarded."\nMeynsata nodded, satisfied with Zonni's decision. "Thank you. While he has not asked for promotions, I am sure he will rejoice. I shall tell the news to him at once."\n"Wait, Meynsata, before you go," Zonni said just as she was about to leave. "I wished to inquire about something."\n"What is it, my Zuwa?" she asked.\n"When the claimant King revealed himself... did you consider betraying me? I know you do not agree with my harsh actions against my enemies. Maybe you thought he would've been a better ruler than me."\nMeynsata was taken aback, and for a while didn't know what to say. "My Zuwa, I..."\n"You can be honest with me, Meynsata," Zonni said with a rare smile.\n"Well then. Briefly, I did. I remembered your justification, that harsh responses to anything you interpret as a personal attack are a way to guarantee you are not attacked again. The intent is to make yourself feared. But... I think you only make others hate you more."\nNow it was Zonni who was silent for a while. "Then... why did you remain loyal?"\n"Because I know that inside you, there is a stallion devoted to honour and justice. Cruelty of life has twisted him and made him cruel in turn, but he is not beyond redemption. No one is.""
zarhay.35.a:0 "Zonni was speechless."

zarhay.36.t:0 "Increased Internal Migration"
zarhay.36.d:0 "Through various reforms and improved internal security, the Zuwa encouraged migration between different parts of the Empire. Economic disparity motivated many zebras to move from poorer rural areas to richer urban ones, especially as the country continued to slowly modernize. Freedom of movement and safe travel routes further facilitated migration. Migrants from distant provinces were even welcomed in Zao, as hostility towards fellow subjects of the Zuwa had been forbidden by law.\n\nWhile initially, there were tensions between migrants and locals in many areas, many families successfully settled down in unfamiliar societies. Unfortunately, many of these migrant groups formed their own communities and clung to their tribal identities even after migrating. One district in Zao occupied by Mazwian migrants even became known as "Mazwitown". Such ethnic enclaves clash against Zonni's plans of integration, so more work has to be done if the tribes are to be united."
zarhay.36.a:0 "Progress is made, at least."

zarhay.37.t:0 "Increased Tribal Intermarriage"
zarhay.37.d:0 "Ancient taboos on marrying "foreigners" from other tribes were abolished, and thus Wind-Singers and other religious authorities across the nation were allowed to bless marriages between any citizen of Zar-Hay. This quickly lead to a sharp increase in the number of marriages between zebras from different tribes, creating many multi-ethnic mixed families. This was especially common between migrants and locals. The foals of these new couples would be the ones most easy to integrate, so within one generation the nation would already be much more united.\n\nHowever, majority of marriages remained contained within individual ethnic groups, and there was little Zonni could do as he could not force his subjects to marry. While he had the legal power to do almost anything, he knew the folly of forced marriages. Integration had to be voluntary for it to be truly effective. Therefore, further measuers to encourage integration needed to be taken."
zarhay.37.a:0 "Not to mention some of the marriages produce no offspring..."

zarhay.38.t:0 "Engineering National Identity"
zarhay.38.d:0 "With increasing state power, came increasing ability of social engineering. For that, however, Zonni had to reluctantly ally with intellectuals from Timbucktu who had pan-Great Lakes ideas of their own. They would be tasked with creating various national symbols for Zar-Hay that would represent the various cultures of the Great Lakes. The purpose was to create a sense of shared identity among the subjects of the Zuwa. These symbols could be anything: Flags, songs, animals, traditions, holidays and so on. As long as they could be used for the purpose of nation-building, it was good enough for Zonni.\n\nSoon enough, the intellectuals had created various proposals. Several flag designs had been made, a traditional song had been adapted into an anthem, a dress used in some isolated rural area was chosen as the national dress, and so on. Zonni picked the ones he thought were suitable and officialized them as national symbols. Finally, these symbols would become known to the population through schools and national festivals. With these shared symbols, a shared identity would be fostered over time. Slowly but surely, the tribes of the Great Lakes were putting their differences aside."
zarhay.38.a:0 "One flag, one nation, one tribe!"

zarhay.39.t:0 "Amalgamation Of A Culture"
zarhay.39.d:0 "While the Zuwa encouraged cultural exchange in general, he decided to make a focused effort to assimilate a single notable culture into the Zar-Hay. There were countless tribes in the Great Lakes, some small and others large, each with their own special traits that had developed over centuries. Zuwa Zonni considered this list to be too vast, and thus narrowed it down to three interesting cultures which could in some way empower the Zar-Hay and the Great Lakes as a whole.\n\nThe first of these was the culture of the savage tribes who lived in the arid fringes of the region. Their population was small, but they were known for their ferocity. They were adopted to the heat of the desert and guarding of the trans-Zebharan trade routes had given them plentiful military experience. Some tribes had already sworn fealty to Zonni, and he respected their abilities greatly. Zar-Hay warriors could learn much from these zebras.\n\nThe second culture of interest was that of Hayzebland. The zebras of Hayzeb had many prospering cities and a vast population. Despite their historical lack of political unity, they were fairly culturally homogenous. Above all, they were industrious and mercantile folk. They were certainly an inspirational model for the Zar-Hay.\n\nThe last culture belonged to the former rivals of Zar-Hay, the Mazwians. Zonni knew it was a controversial option, but he also felt obliged to mend the rift between the tribes of his parents. Perhaps by mixing the two with one another would encourage peace and reconciliation? Nevertheless, Mazwians were capable miners and administrators, being one of the most civilized tribes in the region.\n\nEventually, Zonni finally decided on what culture would form a vital part of the reforged identity of the Zar-Hay."
zarhay.39.a:0 "Our thundering hooves will bring about a sandstorm!"
zarhay.39.b:0 "Zar-Hay should embrace their mercantile heritage."
zarhay.39.c:0 "Two former enemies, united as one!"

zarhay.40.t:0 "Abolitionist Pressure"
zarhay.40.d:0 "For millenia, no zebra had questioned the practice of slavery in the Great Lakes. It was seen as normal and justified for the indebted, the criminals and the prisoners of war to be servile property of their rightful masters. Slaves were the lowest caste, below freezebras and even merchants. Those who were enslaved would doom their offspring to perpetual slavery as well, thus ensuring the caste remained in existence. Slaves usually worked as servants or manual labourers and were owned by either wealthy landowners or the Kingdom. The rest of the Great Lakes had diverse societies, some of which had abolished slavery while others had a system that was almost identical to the one in Zar-Hay. With the unification of the region, the Zar-Hay societal structure was imposed upon the entire region, and thousands of prisoners of war from conquered states were enslaved.\n\nBut there was ever growing pressure to outlaw the practice of slavery, to ban the treatment of individuals as property. The strongest arguments weren't ethical, but economical: As free subjects, former slaves could contribute more to the economy. They could do any jobs they wished, attain education and move to cities. Slaves were dead weight, it was argued. Most importantly though, Zonni had made a promise to Re'emites. In exchance for their aid, he had sworn to eventually abolish slavery. Zonni might've been cruel, but so far he had been a zebra who held true to his word.\n\nThe pressure was becoming overwhelming. Zonni had to decide what to do about slavery. He was the only zebra in the Great Lakes with the power to dismantle it once and for all, if he wanted to."
zarhay.40.a:0 "Slavery is our ancient tradition!"
zarhay.40.b:0 "Slavery will be gradually abolished."
zarhay.40.c:0 "Slavery shall be banned at once!"

zarhay.41.t:0 "Gradual Emancipation"
zarhay.41.d:0 "In fear of angering the slaveowners of his Imperial Realm, Zonni had decided to take a more careful approach to abolishing slavery. First he had instated freedom of the womb, meaning any offspring of slaves would become free zebras at birth. Next he had forbidden the act of enslavement from anyone except state officials, who he never ordered to do so anyways. Then he had emancipated different kinds of slaves one by one, starting with the indebted and ending with the prisoners of war. Finally, before some had even realized, the institution of slavery had been torn down.\n\nHowever, not all former slaves became free. Prisoners of war continued to be subjected to forced labour. Slaves who had been servants continued to serve, earning a meagre wage that was barely enough for sustenance. And lastly, outlawing slavery did not simply erase it, as some continued to keep slaves in secret. State officials often turned a blind eye when they discovered such cases.\n\nZonni had cared little for these issues. What mattered to him was that the abolitionists and the Re'emites had finally gone quiet and left him alone."
zarhay.41.a:0 "Freedom is a rare privilege."

zarhay.42.t:0 "Reunion"
zarhay.42.d:0 "Zonni walked in the windy plains outside of Zao yet again, carrying a bag on his back. But this time he did not come alone. A hundred labourers followed him, bringing shovels and various other tools.\n\nHe stopped at his father's tomb. "Father, I have returned," he said to it. "I have done as I promised. The rifts between the Zar-Hay and the Mazwians are slowly but surely being healed. The two tribes shall be united, like you and mother were." Near him, the workers began their work and dug into the father's mound with their shovels. Zonni grabbed the bag from his back. "And now, you two shall be united once more." He opened the bag, and releaved that it was full of bleached bones. "You should've always been buried together. This shall be an everlasting symbol of the union of the tribes."\n\nAfter several hours, the work was complete. The mound had been re-opened, the bones of Zonni's mother had been placed next to the bones of his father, and the mound was closed again. As the workers began to depart, headed back to their homes, Zonni looked at the mound wistfully and sighed. He could feel the wind blowing on his cheeks, as if it was kissing him gratefully."
zarhay.42.a:0 "Rest in peace now."

zarhay.43.t:0 "Zar-Hay's Ultimatum"
zarhay.43.d:0 "An emissary sent by the Zuwa of Zar-Hay, Zonni Zolon, arrived in [Root.Capital.GetName], accompanied by hardened zebra warriors. She requested an audience with [Root.GetLeader] to discuss an important and urgent matter. Her wish was granted, and soon the two met in private.\n\nThe emissary relayed the message of her master, which was revealed to be an ultimatum. Zuwa Zonni was demanding that [Root.GetName] recognize his supreme authority and submit themselves under his personal protection. He would entrust them with the duty of guarding his Imperial Realm's eastern border from outside threats. If this ultimatum was not accepted, then the dervishes could not be trusted and would have to be... "subjugated by force".\n\nThe ultimatum received a cold reception. They weren't being given much choice: Submit or die. Yet the dervishes did not fear death, and possibly valued their hard-earned freedom even more. [Root.GetLeader] had to quickly decide how to respond to the threat. Would they accept a life of servitude, or die as free hyenas?"
zarhay.43.a:0 "We kneel to no one!"

zarhay.44.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] Refuses Ultimatum"
zarhay.44.d:0 "The emissary Zonni sent to [From.Capital.GetName] returned to Zao and relayed the reply of [From.GetLeader], the leader of the hyenas. Unfortunately, they did not realize how merciful and generous his offer had been. Their refusal to recognize Zonni's authority made them an enemy of the Imperial Realm, and he would not tolerate an enemy on his border. Already, the Imperial Army has been mobilized and ordered to crush the arrogant dervishes of the east."
zarhay.44.a:0 "They will not last long."

zarhay.45.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] Accepts Ultimatum"
zarhay.45.d:0 "The emissary Zonni sent to [From.Capital.GetName] returned to Zao and relayed the reply of [From.GetLeader], the leader of the hyenas. Fortunately, they realized how merciful and generous his offer had been. Their acceptance of Zonni's authority makes them a subject of the Imperial Realm. In return for guarding the eastern border of the realm, they will fully maintain their internal autonomy. Zonni was pleased with this news, as he had fully expected the dervishes to refuse. The Imperial Army was thus demobilized and ordered to stand down -- for now, at least."
zarhay.45.a:0 "They shall serve him faithfully."

zarhay.46.t:0 "Zwahile-Farma"
zarhay.46.d:0 "The newly integrated southern region of Zwahile is distant from the capital, and covers a large geographical area. Therefore a new governorate needs to be established to administer local affairs. [Root.GetLeader] does not have many options, as most of the good governor candidates have already been assigned other regions to govern. The nature of the south as a more of a frontier region however did present the possibility of assigning a zebra with a military background. For this purpose, [Root.GetLeader] considered appointing Fari Ndebi, a faithful officer who had served the Kingdom for many years. He, if anyone, would be able to ensure that the locals remain loyal to Zar-Hay and that defences will be ready against any threats from the west or east. However, as he is so militarily minded he is not perhaps the best possible option for the position of governor, as he would likely neglect civilian matters."

Zuwa Zonni was demanding that [Root.GetName] would cede Ovingoland to Zar-Hay, so he can personally guarantee the security of its zebra inhabitants, many of whom are refugees from the Great Lakes. If this ultimatum was not accepted, then he would seek "alternate methods" of taking control of the region.\n\nThe ultimatum received a cold reception. They weren't given much choice: Give Ovingoland or we will take it by force. [Root.GetLeader] had to consider carefully if the region was worth fighting over, or if it should simply be given away."

Out of all of them, the one belonging to Zonni's father was likely the smallest. It had always been humiliating for Zonni, and something other aristocrats had mocket him for, but that would now change. Soon, he'd be the one having the last laugh.\n\nThousands of workers arrived in the fields, carrying with them tools and construction materials. They would begin work on creating the grandest burial mound Zar-Hay had ever seen. Stone foundations were set for numerous large rooms which would be filled to the brim with burial goods, most of which was loot from Zonni's conquests: Mazwian gold, Aorandan grain, bronze jewelry from Hayzebland and intricate pottery from Timbucktu. In the passages that connected them, artificial rivers liquid mercury would flow, representing Zonni's love for rivers. In the entrance, a grand army of clay zebras would guard the mound from grave robbers. Countless workers perished during the construction in accidents, especially during the final phase when the tomb complex was buried with earth. Some of the workers had also tried stealing burial goods, so Zonni ordered them to be buried alive.\n\nWhen construction was finally completed and the bones of his family moved inside the new underground mausoleum, Zonni inspected the finished work and was pleased. Never again would anyone mock him or his family - not that they dared to do so anyways, knowing retribution would be swift."

zarhay.60.d:0 "Zuwa Zonni sent his emissaries to Re'em, presenting them with the proposal to become part of the Imperial Realm of Zar-Hay. Shockingly, the Re'emites have revealed their true colours by refusing the proposal. They can no longer be regarded as allies or friends of Zar-Hay. In fact, with this act they have proven themselves to be enemies. Zuwa Zonni has officially stated that the Re'emite citizens are eager to join Zar-Hay, yet their treacherous leaders planned to stab their zebra allies in the back. The wishes of the Re'emites must be fulfilled and their corrupt leadership deposed at once."

Unsurpsisingly, the Re'emites have happily accepted the offer and have accepted the terms to disband their army. Imperial forces are already dismantling any border controls between the two nations and are moving in to occupy all major settlements. Re'em shall be swiftly and smoothly integrated into the heartlands of the Imperial Realm, directly administered from Zao itself."

zarhay.62.t:0 "A Remnant Of The Past"
zarhay.62.d:0 "With mass education, economic development and meritocracy in the army, more and more subjects of the Zuwa began to question the necessity of having a caste system. In multiple governorates, and even in Zar-Hay proper, zebras were protesting for the abolishment on restrictions of marriage between castes, and for repealing any laws which limited social mobility. In practice, the caste system had already ceased to exist in the largest cities, where market forces pulled individuals from one occupation to another. Before, the son of a potter was destined to be a potter, but in many places, that was no longer the case.\n\nZonni himself had disdained the existence of a martial warrior caste, even though he had been a member of it. He was an ardent advocate of meritocracy, promoting officers based on skill and not heritage. In the Imperial Army, soldiers came from all kinds of castes. Yet such meritocracy had not extended beyond the military. His advisors reasoned that taking action to repeal the caste system would strengthen the economy as zebras could seek any occupation they wanted. Some, however, warned that forcefully doing such a fundamental societal transformation would be difficult, requiring considerable effort. Especially the upper castes, the aristocrats, would do anything they could to oppose any change to the societal hierarchy.\n\nZonni had the final word, as always. All he had to do was to decide if change was necessary, or if things were fine as they were."
zarhay.62.a:0 "The caste system is a sign of backwardness!"
zarhay.62.b:0 "If it isn't broken, don't fix it."

zarhay.63.t:0 "Secrets Of Life And Death"
zarhay.63.d:0 "Zuwa Zonni arrived in Zarabara with his escort of servants and guards, and saw that the town had changed much over time. The Chief's hut had been replaced with a large modern laboratory, where hundreds of underpaid workers laboured day and night to mass produce magical potions. They were for the most part sold to the Imperial Army, and profits from the sales made the town thrive. It had wide paved streets, tall houses and even a sewage system.\n\nZonni entered the laboratory, having already informed the Chief of his arrival beforehoof. Yet he did not come to meet him, and his servant simply requested him to come to the meeting room. While Zonni was insulted by this, he knew it was unwise to anger the sorcerer. He left his escort behind and entered the room where Chief Faran was waiting. Zonni sat down opposite him and accepted an offer of kola nuts as a gift. "You must know why I have come here, so let us get straight to the point," Zonni said.\n"I know. But I cannot give you what you want."\nZonni frowned. "Excuse me? Surely, the greatest potion brewer in the Great Lakes knows the recipe of a potion that can prolong one's life?"\n"It would be useless. You are not far from death."\nZonni's frown deepened, twisted by anger. "What? Are you threatening me?"\nFaran shook his head and pointed at a small lump in Zonni's neck. "You have a tumour right here. If it's malignant, you won't last much longer."\nZonni blinked in shock and touched the round outgrowth. He hadn't paid much attention to it, but he felt like it had gotten larger over time. "W-what? Is there no cure for this?"\n"For cancer? No, and I doubt there ever will be. Maybe in a century or so."\nShock was swiftly replaced by anger. "Surely you can some up with some way to keep me alive! Or are you a mere fraud, instead of a true sorcerer?"\n"The only creatures immune to cancer are alicorns and dragons. You appear to be neither, so you are doomed."\nZonni clenched his teeth. "Is there anything I can do, then?"\nFaran nodded slowly. "Write a testament. Inform the heir. Make sure the Great Lakes does not fall into anarchy again when you die."\n"But I have no heirs! No close relatives, nothing!"\n"Then appoint one. You have absolute power, do you not?"\nZonni let out a deep sigh, deeper than the abyss of Tartarus."
zarhay.63.a:0 "Who will inherit his legacy?"

zarhay.64.t:0 "Appointing An Heir"
zarhay.64.d:0 "Zonni Zolon was still relatively young, and few cared that he had no official heir yet, except for some of his advisors. But if the sorcerer was right, he had to appoint one as soon as possible, to avoid a disastrous succession crisi from tearing his Imperial Realm apart. He would not allow his family's legacy to be erased by selfish fools. Yet no one was informed that he would die soon. No one except for one zebra, the only one Zonni trusted.\n\nChieftess Meynsata was requested to meet with the Zuwa, and she arrived as quickly as she could. She was never late for anything. When she entered Zonni's throne room, he barked at his servants to leave them alone. Once the room emptied, he sighed deeply. "Meynsata, there is something I must tell you."\n"What is it, my Zuwa?"\n"I am a doomed stallion. Chief Faran said I have cancer, and I have no reason to doubt his words."\nMeynsata's eyes widened in shock. "W-why are you telling me this? Shouldn't you tell everyzebra?"\n"No! They will become like vultures, circling around my dying body. No, it must remain secret. I told you because I want you to inherit the Realm."\nSomehow, Meynsata's eyes widened even more. "Me? Do you really trust me that much?"\n"Yes. Meynsata, I... if things had gone differently, I would've liked for you to be my spouse. You are a mare of valour and honour. I was never... brave enough to tell you that. But it doesn't matter now. I am certain you will do a fine job as the ruler. You will be far more just than I ever was."\nMeynsata kneeled before him, tears forming in her eyes. "I understand, Zonni. I also wish things could've gone differently. But life is rarely predictable. I swear, I will not disappoint you."\nA bittersweet smile formed on Zonni's lips. "I know. You never have.""
zarhay.64.a:0 "The Imperial Realm shall prevail."

zarhay.65.t:0 "Ozymandias"
zarhay.65.d:0 "Zonni's condition worsened rapidly. Mere days ago, he was a strong stallion, lean and muscular, full of ferocious energy. Now, he was a rapidly decaying wreck, suffering from constant pain that was ever worsening. The lump on his throat was now accompanied by other lumps elsewhere in his body. He was bedridden, and it became clear to every zebra in his court that his death was near. Like he had predicted, the vultures began to circle around him, only to be disappointed to learn that he had appointed Meynsata as his heir.\n\nIn his final moments of clarity and consciousness, he told he wished to be buried next to his parents and said he wanted a grand stone epitaph to be erected in the center of Zao. It would read:\n\nYou wail about the loss of life, yet you will live your lives in peace due to my labours.\nYou speak of tyranny, yet you are spared the lash of hunger, the dagger of disease, the sword of fire, thanks to my stability.\nYou claim to live in fear, yet can you not wander the streets and the roads, safe from brigands and bandits thanks to my armies?\nYou bleat about lack of trust, yet I have forged unity and made a thousand bickering tribes into one people.\nYou whine about what was taken from you, yet you are wealthier than you or your ancestors ever were!\nYou cry and moan, saying I'm a monster, yet that very same monster guards your doors from all that which would hurt you!\nYou rave about what was lost, when I gave you everything!\n\nHe fell into a coma on the following day and despite the best efforts of the doctors, passed away within a week. Meynsata was by his side the entire time."
zarhay.65.a:0 "Nothing beside remains."

zarhay.66.t:0 "Uprising In Macigena!"
zarhay.66.d:0 "For a while, Zonni's passing was kept secret from the wider populace in fear of a revolt. Zonni's body was not yet buried and was kept in the palace, and his servants acted like he was still alive. In the meantime Meynsata ensured the Imperial Army was ready for any potential internal unrest. Finally, one week after his death, the truth was revealed to the public.\n\nThe news spread like wildfire across the Imperial Realm. In Zar-Hay, zebras were overtaken by shock and grief, and countless thousands flocked to attend his grand funeral where he was entombed within the burial mound he had constructed. Elsewhere in the Imperial Realm, the mood was more mixed. While many zebras had grown to respect Zonni and accept his rule, they did not necessarily want to remain as subjects of the Imperial Realm. Loyalty was shaky especially among the local sycophantic aristocrats which Zonni had never deposed or weakened. Yet despite these tensions, nothing happened and the country remained calm.\n\nThen a spark lit a bushfire in Macigena.\n\nChief Monzon showed his gratitude to Zonni by launching a well-organized uprising soon after he heard the news of his death. It quickly became clear he had been preparing for it, and a scandal erupted among the Eyes of the Zuwa for failing to prevent the rebellion. He had raised a small army seemingly out of nowhere and expelled any administrators and soldiers loyal to the Imperial Realm of Zar-Hay. His goal was apparently to restore Macigena's independence.\n\nUltimately, his action seemed suicidal. Even with his small personal rebel host, he stood no chance against the might of the Imperial Army, despite his skills in guerilla warfare. Clearly, his only hope was to inspire other uprisings elsewhere. The fate of the Imperial Realm hung in the balance."
zarhay.66.a:0 "Any rebellions will be swiftly taken care of."

zarhay.67.t:0 "Uprising In Zubia!"
zarhay.67.d:0 "Even before Macigena's rebellion, the Eyes of the Zuwa had reported of suspicious activity in the north. Convoys of supplies were moved to strategically vital locations and there was tension in the air. When news of what had happened in Macigena arrived, all Tartarus broke loose.\n\nZubia-Farma Euzegoar seized control of the local garrison with the aid of his own loyalists, and arrested those who did not join his side. Then, he proclaimed that he, as the King of Alwani, was no longer a servant of Zar-Hay. Soon thousands of zebras joined his revolt. Timbucktu, which had previously defied him, now accepted him as their rightful ruler and pledged allegiance to him.\n\nWhen Meynsata heard of this, she remembered how Zonni had spared Euzegoar's life in exchange for his loyalty. Now that he was dead, there was no reason for Euzegoar to continue to serve Zar-Hay. She realized that if Zonni had been true to his nature, instead of being honourable like her, this could've been avoided.\n\nPerhaps Zonni had been right. Being just and merciful wasn't always the right thing to do. Meynsata would remember this when she'd next time meet with Euzegoar, the traitor king."
zarhay.67.a:0 "Death to the traitors!"

zarhay.68.t:0 "Uprising In Ugabi!"
zarhay.68.d:0 "There had always been uneasiness between the Lake-Farma, Amanyi, and the central government. He did not always fully comply with orders and insisted on being able to garrison his own governorate with his own troops. Some concessions were made, but generally Zonni had kept him in a tight leash, threatening to punish him for disobedience.\n\nWhen Zonni died, it was therefore not surprising that Amanyi was much more actively working against Zar-Hay. The Eyes of the Zuwa reported of weapons being smuggled and former UCTA soldiers defecting from the Imperial Army. An arrest warrant was finally issued on Amanyi, but it was too late. With his military force, Amanyi seized personal control of his governorship and declared independence from the Imperial Realm. He urged locals to join his rebellion against a "tyrannical monarchy". With the great prosperity and size of his new breakaway realm, he was able to muster a strong army to secure its independence.\n\nMeynsata couldn't help but feel sorry for Amanyi. Zonni had coerced him to become a governor against his will. A revolt was therefore only a matter of time. It was unfortunate she was the one who was now burdened with the responsibility of dealing with it."
zarhay.68.a:0 "He will be dealt with eventually."

zarhay.69.t:0 "Uprising In Mazwi!"
zarhay.69.d:0 "Under Zogon's governorship, Mazwi had suffered terribly. Harsh taxes were imposed on the local populace, crimes were punished most severely and thousands were arrested, suspected of treason. Despite being half-Mazwian, Zonni had done little to improve the situation. So when he died, it was unsurprising that they would depose Zogon.\n\nThe zebras rallied behind a figure who called himself Manza Maghad, the rightful successor of the late Manza Mahud. He waged a campaign of insurgency, driving out the Zar-Hay garrison with terrible efficiency. Soon, he had gathered a proper army under his banner of liberation. However, he also made promises to restore the Imperial reign of Mazwi over the Great Lakes.\n\nMeynsata found irony in the situation. Maghad reminded her of Zonni back in the day, when he had led a rebellion against Mazwian oppression. Now the tables had turned and it was the Mazwians' turn to do the same. Yet it did not amuse her in the slightest. This appeared like an unending cycle of violence. She would have to stop it, permanently."
zarhay.69.a:0 "Zar-Hay's revolt succeeded, but theirs will fail."

zarhay.70.t:0 "The Imperial Army Swears Loyalty"
zarhay.70.d:0 "After the initial shock of the uprising in Macigena and its ripple effects elsewhere in the Imperial Realm, the commanding officers of the Imperial Army reassured their loyalty to the new Zuwa. The soldiers of the army had fought alongside Meynsata for many years and thus knew she would be a capable ruler of Zar-Hay. They went to action to suppress unrest, especially in areas of direct military control such as protectorates. Afterwards the Imperial Army prepared to crush the rebels who had broken free of Zar-Hay dominion.\n\nMeynsata's determination grew, though she still felt like she could never surpass Zonni's prowess as a military leader. But surely she was more than capable enough of dealing with an army of traitors?"
zarhay.70.a:0 "March to victory!"

zarhay.71.t:0 "The [GetMonth] Revolution"
zarhay.71.d:0 "There comes a point where popular unrest reaches a critical threshold. Once it is reached, the only way to restore order is through violence.\n\nAs the central government of Zar-Hay was unable to calm the rebellious commoners and soldiers who sympathised with them, the situation quickly went out of hoof. Soon, armed militants were roaming the streets of major cities and government buildings were seized one by one. The situation had deteriorated so completely that there was no choice but to mobilize the army. A civil war was inevitable.\n\nMeanwhile, Nyaberi Zargey lit a cigar from Puerto Caballo as she waited for the news. So far, everything had gone according to plan, but plans had an unfortunate tendency to backfire. She lifted her gaze as a zebra soldier entered her makeshift office. "So, how did it go?" she asked from him.\nThe zebra saluted her. "We have successfully secured control of the capital. However, we were unable to capture the leader."\nNyaberi let out an exasperated sigh. "Of course. Oh well, could've gone worse. I guess we've still got work to do then, eh?"\n"Yes, ma'am."\n"What are you waiting for, then? There's reactionaries to shoot. Go!"\nThe soldier nodded and left. Nyaberi relaxed on her uncomfortable seat. Soon enough, she'd be sitting in a proper modern office with a leather chair."
zarhay.71.a:0 "Death to the old order!"

zarhay.72.t:0 "The New Oaths"
zarhay.72.d:0 "The original oaths had been dictated by Zonni himself. As he had been illiterate, a scribe had accurately written down his words. Yet Zonni was a warrior who demanded military discipline from all of his subjects. While Meynsata was a warrior as well, she knew that she could not treat soldiers and commoners alike. Therefore she entrusted a court official to rewrite the oaths to be less strict. The revised four oaths were:\n\nWith God as my witness, I solemnly swear to dedicate a part of my life to diligent, productive labour to further the prosperity of my household. I shall obediently give a small portion of my wealth to the Zuwa, so she may use it wisely for the common good of the nation.\n\nWith God as my witness, I solemnly swear to dedicate a part of my life to community service. I shall not conspire against the rightful government, for the sake of peace and order in the realm. I shall obey the commands of my superiors and only question them if they are unreasonable.\n\nWith God as my witness, I solemnly swear to dedicate a part of my life to public security. I shall not aid any potential spies or criminals, instead reporting them to my superiors so they may be dealt with.\n\nWith God as my witness, I solemnly swear to dedicate a part of my life to defending the nation against any foreign incursions. I shall answer the call when I am needed on the front. In battle, I shall only retreat or surrender when the sole other alternative is death."
zarhay.72.a:0 "The Zuwa is fair and just."

zarhay.73.t:0 "On The Matter Of Trade"
zarhay.73.d:0 "Meynsata was not particularly fond of policymaking, but it was a necessary evil for a ruler like her. She had inherited this burden from a stallion whom she had respected, perhaps even admired. She wanted to make Zonni's spirit proud while it still roamed the land. But she couldn't help but admit that she'd rather fight with her spear than with a pencil.\n\nShe summoned two trustworthy advisors: Chieftess Amzina and Yaniv Litzhol. Both knew much more about economic matters than she did, and she asked them to explain what trade policy would be best for the Imperial Realm. Amzina spoke first, and was quick to explain how a liberal, open economy was the best for both the common folk and the government. If goods were allowed to flow freely, the economy would grow faster, ultimately resulting in more taxes and increased prosperity. The Re'emite horse had a completely different opinion, however. He reasoned that Zar-Hay was such a large nation that they were largely self-sufficient in many resources. If they allowed unlimited exports, not only would they lose all the potential tariffs, but raw resources would flow out of the country. It would be better to keep them within the national market, so they could be refined locally, thus driving economic development and lowering prices of refined goods.\n\nMeynsata did not really understand anything what was said, but had to decide which advisor was the more reasonable one."
zarhay.73.a:0 "Yaniv is right."
zarhay.73.b:0 "Amzina is right."

zarhay.74.t:0 "Everywhere At The End Of Time"
zarhay.74.d:0 "Not long had passed since Zonni's unexpected death, but the memory of him was already fading, shifting and warping. Some zebras remembered him as a merciless tyrant who ruled with force, while others admired him as the greatest hero of Zar-Hay since Zargitau. Thousands blamed him for the deaths of their loved ones, and thousands celebrated him as the Uniter of the Great Lakes. It soon became clear that these two contrasting interpretations of the past could not co-exist. One would have to dominate the other, and ultimately it was the duty of the state-sponsored chroniclers and griots to choose what narrative would prevail.\n\nMeynsata invited a certain famous griot to a personal meeting at a rather unusual location: Near the tomb of the deceased Zuwa. She accepted the invitation after initial hesitation. Once she arrived, Meynsata was already waiting there, alone.\n"Fassa Balleke, I presume?" the Zuwa asked.\nThe griot nodded and bowed. "Yes. It is an honour to speak with your majesty."\n"Spare me the formalities. I wished to speak to you about an important matter."\n"What is it?" She looked at the grass-covered burial mound. "Does it have something to do with my former employer?"\n"Yes. I have a simple question: How do you think he should be remembered?"\nFassa frowned and pondered. "Well, he was a... complicated stallion, to say the least. He was generous to his allies and ruthless to his enemies. I became rich thanks to him, but I know fellow griots who lost their heads for making fun of him."\n"Answer the question, please."\nFassa sighed. "We griots sing what others want us to sing, I am afraid. We do not choose our narratives ourselves, for it is a breach of our duty. We merely record oral tradition."\n"Allow me to rephrase my question, then. How would you tell Zonni's story?"\nShe took a deep breah. "I think I would say that...""

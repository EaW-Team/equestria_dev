zeeb.32.d:0 "Our fleet set out not too long ago to capture more slaves, now they've returned with plenty of loot and slaves to be sold on the market."
zeeb.32.a:0 "Good haul."

zeeb.33.t:0 "The City of Minotauria"
zeeb.33.d:0 "As the morning sun rises up in the sky, our fleet approaches the city of Minotauria. The waters are calm, and due to the early hour we've arrived at, only a few of the Minotaurs are actually up and awake. A hush falls upon the fleet as several of our ships move forwards into the city's port. Then, the chaos begins."
zeeb.33.a:0 "Attack!"

zeeb.34.t:0 "Attacking Minotauria"
zeeb.34.d:0 "Our warriors fall upon the city like a hungry beast being presented with a feast, nothing is left untouched. Scores of minotaurs are herded onto our boats whilst fierce fighting goes on deeper within the city. Slowly and steadily do our cargo holds fill up with hundreds of Minotaur, the fleet having a bit of trouble keeping up with the sheer amount of people we're taking."
zeeb.34.a:0 "Just as planned."

zeeb.35.t:0 "End of the Raid"
zeeb.35.d:0 "About two hours or so later, our ships have finally been filled to the brim. Our warriors start retreating, heading back onboard while fending off any Minotaurs who still have some fight left in them. Just as quickly as we arrived do we set off, back home to Nyumbampya. "
zeeb.35.a:0 "Another great raid."

zeeb.36.t:0 "Minotauria Burns!"
zeeb.36.d:0 "Earlier today, the City of Minotauria was raided by a large fleet of Zebra Slavers! They snuck in as the night fell, and within hours they had assaulted the city and fled with hundreds of innocent Minotaurs taken as captives. The fleet attempted to chase them, but they were too fast."
zeeb.36.a:0 "Oh no!"

zeeb.37.t:0 "The Story of the Zebra Colony"
zeeb.37.d:0 "Nyumba ya Kaskazini started out many decades ago as a lowly colony of the Zebrican Empire. Years of neglect and lack of profits from the colony slowly turned it to ruin, until the great pirate Shomari Hamad came to the small port town of Nyumbampya and started the slave trade there. Ever since then, the colony has grown into it's own independent nation, left to it's own devices by the Zebrican Empire. The current ruler of Nyumba ya Kaskazini is Khalfani, a middle aged Zebra who's service to the nation has been rather dull. But, not everything about his reign has been boring, as whispers of one of the largest raids yet have been planned. Some say the raid will be on the Federation, others say it could be a raid on the prosperous Minotaurs to the west. Regardless of what it truly is, Nyumba ya Kaskazini is finally going to be more than a lowly colony. "
zeeb.37.a:0 "Great."

### FOCUS LOCALISATION ####################
###########################################
BAL_revolution:0 "Form The Baltimare Congress"
BAL_revolution_desc:0 "If we wish to prevail in this conflict, we must stand united in purpose. To this end, we must establish a democratic government to replace the old one. Proper elections will have to wait for peace, so for now every party and union will get equal representation."
BAL_anarchists_in_government:0 "Anarchists In The Government"
BAL_anarchists_in_government_desc:0 "Though the anarchists of CAN have so far been hesitant about joining the congress, they have now mostly come to an agreement that cooperation with a statist entity is necessary. With representation in the Congress, they can oppose any proposals from PON or IU that infringe too much on their liberty."
BAL_advisors_from_stg:0 "Advisors From Stalliongrad"
BAL_advisors_from_stg_desc:0 "Our comrades in Stalliongrad have had years of experience from both struggle against the bourgeoisie as well as running a communist country. We would be foolish to not ask for their help. Their sharpest minds and most cunning commanders will be a great boon to our war effort... That is, if they agree to send them here."
BAL_workers_self_management:0 "Workers' Self-Management"
BAL_workers_self_management_desc:0 "The means of production belong to the workers, so the workers themselves must be allowed to manage their own businesses freely with minimal interference. With increased autonomy in daily labour, morale will be boosted and exploitation by bosses and managers will be eliminated competely."
BAL_nationalization:0 "State Interventionism"
BAL_nationalization_desc:0 "The path to communism is not an easy one, and the recent economic chaos has proven that intervention by a central authority is necessary as a temporary measure, especially during conflict. As our government is a democratic and proletarian one, workers' control of the state-owned means of production is still possible."
BAL_mayors_fate:0 "Deciding The Mayor's Fate"
BAL_mayors_fate_desc:0 "The former mayor of Baltimare, Ash Moustache, proved to be no better than the despotic mare who set her police-hounds upon us during the general strike of 995. He openly welcomed the imperialist thestrals and happily cooperated with their short-lived tyrannical regime. Yet some among us speak of friendship and forgiveness. The Congress must convene to decide his fate."
BAL_loot_royal_armouries:0 "Loot Royal Armouries"
BAL_loot_royal_armouries_desc:0 "The small garrison of the Equestrian army in Baltimare was apprehended by the lunarists when they occupied the city, but their equipment was left alone in their armouries. What are we waiting for? Let's crack them open and empty them and take what we need. We don't want the guns to end up in the filthy hooves of monarchists or lunarists, after all."
BAL_form_industrial_committees:0 "Form Industrial Committees"
BAL_form_industrial_committees_desc:0 "So far there has been a complete lack of planning and cooperation in our newly established socialist economy. We must rectify this by establishing democratic workers' committees in our production facilities and farms, which will then make decentralized economic plans together and execute them in collaboration with each other."
BAL_meadowbrooks_aid:0 "Mage Meadowbrook's Aid"
BAL_meadowbrooks_aid_desc:0 "In the Hayseed Swamps, one of the ancient Pillars of Equestria lives. She is known as Meadowbrook and her skills at healing are already famous in the region. While she has shown no interest in our revolutionary cause and might harbour monarchist sympathies, she is more than willing to heal our wounded and sick militiaponies, which helps their morale as well."
BAL_weapons_from_stalliongrad:0 "Weapons From Stalliongrad"
BAL_weapons_from_stalliongrad_desc:0 "Our comrades in the cold north have a thriving industry and vast stockpiles of armaments. Surely they will happily supply us with anything we ask for? This way we will leave the Equestrian armouries alone and avoid angering them or their supporters. Of course, we must first decide what exactly we want from Stalliongrad."
BAL_supreme_economic_council:0 "Establish The Supreme Economic Council"
BAL_supreme_economic_council_desc:0 "The Congress has decreed that a single council shall be established that will be responsible for formulating a single state-wide economic plan for the duration of the war. They will also supervise that all institutions below them will closely follow their plans for production, distribution and allocation. Divergence from this plan will not be tolerated."
BAL_armed_unions:0 "Armed Trade Unions"
BAL_armed_unions_desc:0 "Our labour unions have already taken up arms and formed their own militias. Now Comrade Delicious proposes we enshrine their right to bear arms in law, further integrating the common workers into our military. Members of trade unions are eager to serve and defend their homes from reactionary aggression, though their skill is questionable at best."
BAL_revolutionary_discipline:0 "Revolutionary Discipline"
BAL_revolutionary_discipline_desc:0 "It is useless to simply order a soldier to fight. One must explain to them why they must fight and why it is important to keep doing so. Then they will take up arms willingly instead of being forced to do it, and won't run away at the first sight of danger."
BAL_consolidate_production:0 "Consolidate Production"
BAL_consolidate_production_desc:0 "It is becoming clear to us that small businesses are lacking in efficiency compared to larger ones. We must shut down the shops of the petit bourgeoisie and establish larger syndicates of production, capable of employing more workers and being easier to manage by our committees."
BAL_anti_monarchism:0 "Anti-Monarchist Rally"
BAL_anti_monarchism_desc:0 "Equestrian ponies have traditionally always looked up to Princess Celestia and other alicorns as some godlike beings who can do no wrong. The violent repression of the Winter Revolution proved otherwise, as has the recent civil war. Yet some still delude themselves. We must reveal the truth of these despicable monarchs to all, and hopefully turn them to our side."
BAL_create_mis:0 "Create The MIS"
BAL_create_mis_desc:0 "Lavender Berry, leader of the IU, has proposed we establish a secret service comprised of his party members. They will investigate suspected traitors to the revolution and apprehend enemy spies, as well as decrypt the communications of our foes. Lavender is eager to make use of his talents as the head of such an organisation."
BAL_military_commissars:0 "Military Commissars"
BAL_military_commissars_desc:0 "To maintain high morale within our militia and to better endoctrinate them to our revolutionary cause, we need political commissars attached to every military unit. Not only will they act as inspiring leaders, but will also manage supplies and maintain strict war-time rationing among our ranks."
BAL_protect_middle_class:0 "Protect The Middle Class"
BAL_protect_middle_class_desc:0 "The anarcho-syndicalists are eager to collectivize the property of smallholders and traders, thinking that they are enemies of the revolution. They are mistaken. It is the bourgeoisie, the imperialists and the monarchists who stand against us. We do not want to antagonize the moderates; Instead, let us befriend them and gain a powerful ally."
BAL_delicious_column:0 "Form The Delicious Column"
BAL_delicious_column_desc:0 "As Golden Delicious marches across the countryside, more and more ponies flock to his red banner, eager to participate in the revolution. Many foreigners arrive from abroad too, eager to help our cause. We should welcome them openly and give them supplies so they can participate in the fighting and bring the revolution to our enemies."
BAL_abolish_bit:0 "Abolish The Bit"
BAL_abolish_bit_desc:0 "Money has no place in the socialist society we are creating as the war rages on. Distribution shall solely be based on need instead of personal wealth. We will repurpose native temples into communal warehouses and allow the ponies to take what they need from them. If shortages appear, rationing will take place so everyone gets their fair share."
BAL_red_terror:0 "Red Terror"
BAL_red_terror_desc:0 "The anti-monarchist rally has galvanized us. Let us now release this fury kindling in our hearts and aim it at the enemies among us, the bankers, the industrialists, the imperialists, the monarchists, the priests and the landowners. All who threaten the revolution of the proletariat, all who have oppressed us for decades and centuries, all must bleed."
BAL_state_capitalism:0 "State Capitalism"
BAL_state_capitalism_desc:0 "In these dire times, it is necessary for the state to run the economy. It is a patient step on the road to socialism, and combines capitalism with state control and ownership, thus preventing exploitation by bourgeoisie which occurs in unlimited, normal capitalism."
BAL_regular_army:0 "Establish A Regular Army"
BAL_regular_army_desc:0 "This war will not be won by bands of unorganized, undisciplined militiaponies. We must establish a proper, hierarchically organized and centrally commanded army. Only then do we stand a chance against the reactionary hordes threatening our revolution."
BAL_devolve_government:0 "Devolve Government"
BAL_devolve_government_desc:0 "While so far the Congress has been capable of making relatively wise decisions, the influence of the statists is too great and hinders our plans for a true socialist utopia. To remove these centrists, reformists and traitors to the revolution out of the picture, we must weaken the Congress and empower local, grassroots institutions."
BAL_arrest_anarchists:0 "Arrest Anarchists"
BAL_arrest_anarchists_desc:0 "Stalliongrad keeps threatening to withdraw support if we do not do something about the radical mobs endangering the integrity of our newborn communist state. We cannot allow them to roam around with their own armed patrols, illegally collectivizing what they want and disregarding the decisions of the Congress. Law and order must be restored by any means necessary."
BAL_to_the_barricades:0 "To The Barricades!"
BAL_to_the_barricades_desc:0 "Now that we are secure from within, we must secure ourselves from without. Reactionaries wishing to destroy our revolution need to be crushed, and the workers have to be rallied to defend their communal homes from the enemy who wishes to take everything away from us and reduce us back into slavery. Long live the revolution! They shall not pass!"

BAL_proclaim_sesr:0 "Proclaim The SESR"
BAL_proclaim_sesr_desc:0 "Now that we have defeated the opposition to our revolution, it is time to integrate the lands which were previously under reactionary occupation. All proletariat are welcome to join our newborn South-Eastern Socialist Republic and embrace its socialist ideals. Workers of the south-east, unite!"
BAL_elections:0 "Hold Elections"
BAL_elections_desc:0 "The foundations for our republic are in place. Soon it will be time for the provisional government to step down and for new leaders, elected democratically, to take their place. Of course, reactionary parties will not be allowed to participate, but other than that all adult proletariat are free to vote or become candidates."
BAL_complete_anarchy:0 "CAN's Revolution"
BAL_complete_anarchy_desc:0 "The militants of the Confederation of Anarchists have succeeded in their goal of dismantling the despicable state. Now the workers of the south-east can know true freedom and communism, instead of the propagandist lies that PON and IU wish to feed them. Power begets parasites. Long live Anarchy!"
BAL_hunt_monarchists:0 "Drive Out The Monarchists"
BAL_hunt_monarchists_desc:0 "Supporters of the old order have no place in our revolutionary society. Celestia is like an overbearing authoritative mother, and these fools are like children who do not dare to speak against her. If they love her so much, then why don't they get the heck out of here and run back to their sweet princess?"
BAL_erase_statism:0 "Erase All Traces Of Statism"
BAL_erase_statism_desc:0 "The bloated, inefficient and heartless organism of state must not simply be slain, its remains must be burnt to ashes. All the bureaucrats will have to find new employment, but at least we are no longer oppressed by an artificial monster we had created to rule over us. The end result will be a patchwork of decentralized, autonomous communes which govern themselves."
BAL_freedom_of_faith:0 "Freedom Of Faith"
BAL_freedom_of_faith_desc:0 "While many of us have low opinions on religion, it is ultimately each individual's private matter. As long as faith is not used as a tool of oppression, it will be allowed to be practiced freely. The natives will rejoice and be reassured that we have no intention to repress their unique and valuable culture."
BAL_crush_lunatics:0 "Hunt Down The Lunatics"
BAL_crush_lunatics_desc:0 "Lunarists, or as we call them, lunatics, are a threat to our revolution. They remain loyal to their tyrannical despot, Nightmare Moon, and her clique of military oppressors. It seems it was not enough to defeat them once, we have to do so again. Let the hunt begin."
BAL_native_communes:0 "Native Communes"
BAL_native_communes_desc:0 "The natives wish for little more than to be left alone. This can easily be arranged. The tribes barely have any concept of property and private ownership anyways, so all we need to do is gently encourage collectivization while respecting their traditions."
BAL_no_princesses_state_or_boss:0 "No Princesses, Nor State, Nor Boss"
BAL_no_princesses_state_or_boss_desc:0 "Despots and overlords, oppressors of all kind, do not exist in our free society. Voluntary cooperation, mutual aid and horizontalism form our core principles. No one is forced to do anything, yet everyone must understand the importance of the greater good. We have no need for anyone to guide or lead us, as long as we share a common goal. Freedom forever!"
BAL_our_syndie_buddies:0 "Our Syndicalist Friends"
BAL_our_syndie_buddies_desc:0 "The labour unions of TER have always been our close allies and aided us in our struggle for liberty. We should now repay them and make amends, integrating the unions into our confederacy. Working together, we will reach greater heights than we ever could by ourselves."
BAL_participatory_democracy:0 "Participatory Democracy"
BAL_participatory_democracy_desc:0 "The representative democracy of SESR was a joke. True democracy isn't about choosing who makes decisions for you. It is about being able to participate in decision-making personally. Every individual has the right to take part in the politics of their commune, and each commune can take part in the politics of the confederacy. Thus, we will have real, direct democracy."
BAL_tear_down_taboos:0 "Tear Down Taboos"
BAL_tear_down_taboos_desc:0 "The rules of our free society are not as restrictive and oppressive as the laws of the past. Almost everything that doesn't harm others is allowed, as individuals cannot impose their own morality upon others. Things which were previously forbidden and frowned upon are now seen as natural. Let us liberate ourselves from the shackles of society!"
BAL_abolish_compulsory_ed:0 "Abolish Compulsory Education"
BAL_abolish_compulsory_ed_desc:0 "Forcing young foals to sit on a school bench eight hours a day and five days a week is nothing but capitalist oppression, an assembly line of skilled workers for their factories. This authoritarian education system must be torn down and replaced with democratic, voluntary education. Explaining the importance of studying to foals and including play and choice will make them eager to learn."
BAL_suffer_no_state:0 "Suffer No State To Live"
BAL_suffer_no_state_desc:0 "A new state has been founded west of us, and like us they are a confederacy. But instead of consisting of anarchist communes, they consist of racist states, bent on protecting their "rights", such as the right to oppress native buffalo. We will not tolerate such a disgusting entity existing next door. No, we must tear it down and burn it to the ground!"
BAL_syndie_gang:0 "TER Triumphant"
BAL_syndie_gang_desc:0 "The syndicalists of TER have won the elections and Golden Delicious is SESR's new chairpony. They will now seek to implement reforms to turn the nation into a federation of democratic trade unions, though some doubt if the urbanites of TER can win over the rural ponies as well."
BAL_suppress_middle_class:0 "Suppress The Middle Class"
BAL_suppress_middle_class_desc:0 "So far the traders and merchants have been unenthusiastic about our revolution and refuse to allow their businesses to be collectivized. They wish to keep their high wages and expensive bourgeois lifestyle at the expense of their workers. This cannot be tolerated, though we cannot use force. They must be driven out of the market so they eventually go bankrupt and join our collectives voluntarily."
BAL_federal_charter:0 "Federal Charter"
BAL_federal_charter_desc:0 "With a majority in the Ponies' Parliament, we can draft a new amendment to the constitution for SESR, establishing it as a federal nation consisting of member states with extensive rights. To avoid complete chaos, the central government will retain some legislative power, but most responsibility will be devolved to lower levels, to local communes, municipalities and provinces."
BAL_rural_communes:0 "Persuade The Farmers"
BAL_rural_communes_desc:0 "As an organization of urban trade unions, we have never enjoyed much popularity outside of cities. Rural collectives remain few in number and most of the land remains in the hooves of individual landowners and native tribes. The solution is sending rural revolutionaries to spread the word of the benefits of joining a collective and highlighting the flaws of the capitalist system."
BAL_thestral_segregation:0 "Thestral Segregation"
BAL_thestral_segregation_desc:0 "As our fight against the stubborn lunar resistance continues, we must begin to consider what we do with the thestral population of the south-east once the fighting ends. The most popular proposal is that of making thestrals second-class citizens and guaranteeing them some basic rights, yet keeping them separate from the main populace for safety reasons."
BAL_native_reservations:0 "Native Reservations"
BAL_native_reservations_desc:0 "While many natives have voluntarily joined our communes, something must be done about those who cling on to their backwards ways. If they want to live their lives in poverty and misery, so be it. If they leave us alone, we will leave them alone too, in designated zones reserved for native inhabitation only."
BAL_abolish_political_parties:0 "Disband Political Parties"
BAL_abolish_political_parties_desc:0 "Political parties are an obstacle to true democracy. They group individuals according to their political views, and are usually open to everyone regardless of class, which presents an opportunity for bourgeois influence. Trade unions are far better as organizations, for they are for the working class only, and are not divided politically. Therefore parties must be entirely supplanted by unions."
BAL_anarchist_allies:0 "Our Anarchist Allies"
BAL_anarchist_allies_desc:0 "TER does not exist on its own, but as an alliance with the anarchist organization of CAN. Together we are known as CAN-TER, and have cooperated for years, preparing for revolution and demanding more rights for the workers. Now that the revolution has been successful, our friendship can continue to flourish. Together, we will create a free socialist society, where the state has minimal power over the workers."
BAL_encourage_unions:0 "Expand Union Membership"
BAL_encourage_unions_desc:0 "Labour unions exist to protect their members from abuse, to empower the common worker and to unite the working class together. Membership in unions is only a good thing, yet many workers in the south-east have not joined one yet. We must promote unions and encourage ponies to sign up and join them!"
BAL_worker_assemblies:0 "Workers' Assemblies"
BAL_worker_assemblies_desc:0 "The structure of governance must be built from the bottom up. Therefore all decisions must be made in plenary assemblies, where all workers who are members of the unions in question seek to reach a consensus. This system, existing on every level of government from local to national, will enshrine direct democracy as the foundation of the SESR."
BAL_industrial_unions:0 "Industrial Unions"
BAL_industrial_unions_desc:0 "The building blocks of our federation shall be industrial unions. They unite workers across multiple crafts in the same industry under one banner, thus giving the members more power than they would have if they were divided into smaller craft unions. This way solidarity among workers of each industrial sector will also be promoted, and industrial unions can work together to advance our society and improve our lives."
BAL_support_unions_abroad:0 "Support Unions Abroad"
BAL_support_unions_abroad_desc:0 "The cause of revolution is international, and it is our duty to aid our comrades who continue to suffer in wage-slavery beyond the borders of our federation. We, ponies of TER, must continue to maintain friendship with all unions of Equus, so one day all workers of the world will be free from their chains."
BAL_corn_lord_triumphs:0 "PON Victorious"
BAL_corn_lord_triumphs_desc:0 "The communist PON party, lead by Cricket Chafer, has won the elections. [STG.GetLeader] of Stalliongrad has already sent congratulations and is willing to support our young nation on its path to true socialism. Their help might be needed, as SESR still has many problems to resolve."
BAL_propaganda_campaign:0 "Propaganda Campaign"
BAL_propaganda_campaign_desc:0 "The most effective tool of the revolution is propaganda. It can be used to easily win the support of the working class and to inspire them to fight against reactionaries and class enemies. Propaganda must therefore be spread on the radio, in the newspapers, on posters and loudspeakers and more. If we also "persuade" the popular healer Meadowbrook to support us, the ponies will love us."
BAL_democratic_centralism:0 "Democratic Centralism"
BAL_democratic_centralism_desc:0 "One grave issue with the socialists of Baltimare is their lack of unity. To ensure fruitful cooperation, all decisions agreed upon via democratic vote will be binding for all party members and lower bodies of government. This will also speed up the decision-making process as a whole, with less time spent on arguing. Some say it is not truly democratic, but none can deny it is more efficient."
BAL_ban_religion:0 "Ban Religion"
BAL_ban_religion_desc:0 "The natives of the south-east have a worrying practice of worshipping a sun deity, the thestrals see the tyrant Nightmare Moon as a godly figure and among the Celestial State are similar religious fanatics. Their faith drove them to violent and repressive acts during the war, proving what a danger religion truly is. We must stop this nonsense at once and impose strict punishments for worshippers."
BAL_talk_to_narrative:0 "Talk To Light Narrative"
BAL_talk_to_narrative_desc:0 "Light Narrative is a prominent figure among the thestrals, and unlike most of his compatriots, is reasonable and simply wants peace in the south-east. We should seek to cooperate with him and together convince the lunarist remnants to end their misguided resistance."
BAL_enlighten_savages:0 "Enlighten The Savages"
BAL_enlighten_savages_desc:0 "The natives are proving to be an obstacle on the way of progress, fiercely resisting our revolutionary ideas and clinging onto their backwards ways. They should be taught a lesson in humility, and then shown the wonders of modernity-- by force, if necessary."
BAL_unban_non_socialists:0 "Unban Non-Socialist Parties"
BAL_unban_non_socialists_desc:0 "If the ponies want true democracy, let them have it. The ban on non-socialist parties will be lifted, for the most part, though most extreme and reactionary parties remain strictly forbidden. They are unlikely to challenge our power, but at least the more conservative proletariat will rejoice."
BAL_student_exchange:0 "Student Exchange With Stalliongrad"
BAL_student_exchange_desc:0 "There are many highly educated ponies in Stalliongrad who have graduated from their communist institutes and academies. We should send some of our students there who could learn much from them, and in return welcome any curious pupils from Stalliongrad who wish to study in Stableside or Tenochtitlan."
BAL_cultural_revolution:0 "Cultural Revolution"
BAL_cultural_revolution_desc:0 "To preserve our frail and newborn communism, we must expunge remains of capitalism and traditionalism from our society. The cultural divisions in our country will be no more, and Severyanan will become the new official language of SESR. From the ashes, a proud socialist nation will rise!"
BAL_union_council:0 "All-Union Central Council Of Trade Unions"
BAL_union_council_desc:0 "The syndicalists of TER have long requested more union representation in government to ensure true workers' control of the economy. To appease them, we shall establish the AUCCTU, an umbrella organization of the country's many labour unions. They will act as partners in management, promoting worker morale and productivity as well as providing them services and improving their standard of living."
BAL_university_towns:0 "University Towns"
BAL_university_towns_desc:0 "Scientists work best when they have peace, services and good salaries. All these are guaranteed in dedicated university towns, far from the bustle of big cities and equipped with a wide array of services. Such settlements must be established around SESR so scholars can move in them and innovate better than ever before."
BAL_trust_in_stg:0 "Trust In Stalliongrad"
BAL_trust_in_stg_desc:0 "Stalliongrad is the home of revolution on Equus. As Comrade Chafer experienced in person, they were able to beat back the hordes of Equestria. If we wish to survive from reactionary aggression, we must seek an alliance with our northern comrades and stand united as one!"
BAL_oh_shit_oh_fuck:0 "IU In Power"
BAL_oh_shit_oh_fuck_desc:0 "The plans were successful. Traitors to the revolution have been sidelined. Our control of the SESR has been mostly secured. Yet dissidents and reactionary filth remain. They must be eradicated with extreme prejudice. This is Comrade Berry's decree and it will be obeyed.\n\nGlory to the South-East."
BAL_control_press:0 "Control The Press"
BAL_control_press_desc:0 "The so-called "freedom of speech" presents a threat to our stability. It allows subversive and dangerous ideas to spread if left unchecked. The "Baltimare Times" and associated publications must undergo extensive scrutiny by editors. They will ultimately be cleansed of reactionary thought."
BAL_weaken_parliament:0 "Weaken The Parliament"
BAL_weaken_parliament_desc:0 "The Ponies' Parliament presents an obstruction for the functioning of state bureaucracy. Comrade Berry is displeased with remaining dissidents in it. They must not be allowed to interfere in the execution of his directives. Therefore the constitution must be amended. The yes-ponies of our party will guarantee this motion carries. The parliament will be defanged completely."
BAL_purge_opposition:0 "Purge Opposition"
BAL_purge_opposition_desc:0 "Some are displeased with the current situation. Their dissent presents a threat to our stability. They must be silenced before they gather more followers. Time is of the essence. We must act quickly. We must act ruthlessly. We must do all we can to ensure peace and order. No matter the cost."
BAL_burn_jungles:0 "Burn The Jungles"
BAL_burn_jungles_desc:0 "The thestral scum think they will prevail by hiding in the jungle. But what is a safe haven will quickly become a deadly trap. Copious amounts of napalm and other incendiaries are being prepared for the greatest fire-bombing campaign in known history. The lunar resistance will be completely eliminated."
BAL_i_said_burn:0 "I Said Burn Them!"
BAL_i_said_burn_desc:0 "Comrade Berry is not pleased with the indigenous ponies who continue to endanger the safety of citizens and opposing government control. The most severe areas of resistance are to be destroyed. If the rest continue to fight they will be destroyed as well. We are ready to wipe out the entire dissident population if needed."
BAL_labour_camps:0 "Reactionary Labour Camps"
BAL_labour_camps_desc:0 "Those imprisoned for conspiring against the State have unexploited potential. They should not be left to rot in their cells. Comrade Berry has a far better use for them. They shall toil in the mines. They shall toil in the jungles. They shall mine. They shall make roads. When they perish they will do so with a smile on their lips for they know they contributed for the greater good of the State."
BAL_fortify_border:0 "Fortify The Border"
BAL_fortify_border_desc:0 "The threats from within are being dealt with efficiently. Preparations must be made for facing the threats without. The prisoners must be put to work to construct bunkers and trenches across the border. We need to be prepared for tyrannical foreign states invading our own sovereign State."
BAL_single_culture:0 "A Single State, A Single Culture"
BAL_single_culture_desc:0 "Divisions weaken a State. Divisions can destroy a state. Equestria faced such a fate. We will not. We have one language. We have one culture. We have one leader. We are one. We shall die as one.\n\nGlory to the South-East."
BAL_establish_ministries:0 "Establish New Ministries"
BAL_establish_ministries_desc:0 "More effective governance requires more bureaucracy. New agencies will be established which are directly subservient to Comrade Berry. They will execute his decress with utmost efficiency and speed."
BAL_papers_please:0 "Papers, Please"
BAL_papers_please_desc:0 "The State is always in need of more workers. Every citizen is guaranteed work. Many foreigners seek to acquire citizenship. This shall be allowed to a limited extent. Strict border controls will ensure no miscreants enter.\n\nGlory to the South-East."
BAL_glory_to_southeast:0 "Glory To The South-East"
BAL_glory_to_southeast_desc:0 "The South-East State shall last a thousand years. It is the most stable country. It is the most prosperous country. It is the strongest country. Nothing can destroy that which is invincible. Not even Equestria or the Lunar Empire. We shall show them that we are indestructible."

BAL_continue_collectivization:0 "Continue Collectivization"
BAL_continue_collectivization_desc:0 "During the civil war, our efforts to collectivize private property were hampered by the foolish state socialists, who disliked our establishment of autonomous communes and cooperatives. Now we can continue unabated and eradicate any remnants of capitalism once and for all!"
BAL_according_to_need:0 "To Each According To Need"
BAL_according_to_need_desc:0 "Increased collectivization results in increased productivity as workers are more eager to work for themselves and the community rather than for an oppressive, demanding boss. This means there is a surplus, and this surplus belongs to all who need it, no matter who they are. The cripples, the young, the ill and the elderly, all shall have their share."
BAL_mutual_aid:0 "Mutual Aid"
BAL_mutual_aid_desc:0 "Every commune is reliant on other communes to sustain itself, as no commune can produce everything they need by themselves. Resources and services are exchanged freely for mutual benefit, with no one asking for payment or immediate reward. Selfishness and greed have no place in our society."
BAL_connect_communes:0 "Connect The Communes"
BAL_connect_communes_desc:0 "Some of the rural communes are isolated in the impassable jungle, unable to reach their neighbours easily. To make cooperation between all communes possible, we must work together and clear out paths and railways in the forests."
BAL_no_such_thing_as_ownership:0 "No Such Thing As Ownership"
BAL_no_such_thing_as_ownership_desc:0 "No one here owns anything. Our society has usufruct property norms; means of production are merely used by those who need to use them, and no one claims any property, private or common, for themselves. The earth belongs to the living."
BAL_everypony_a_gun:0 "Guns For Everypony!"
BAL_everypony_a_gun_desc:0 "Every member of our society has a right to bear arms. The gun is the primary guarantor of liberty, empowering the individual and making each commune a stronghold. No one will take our liberty from us if we make guns for all of us."
BAL_haven_of_freedom:0 "A Haven Of Friendship And Freedom"
BAL_haven_of_freedom_desc:0 "In south-eastern Equestria, we have a created a society that slowly advances towards a utopia. There is no oppression, nothing compulsory or mandatory. A pony once said that nothing is certain except death and taxes. But here, only death is guaranteed, especially for bosses, reactionaries and monarchists!"
BAL_worker_cooperatives:0 "Worker Cooperatives"
BAL_worker_cooperatives_desc:0 "Self-management of factories by workers isn't enough. They must always be owned by the workers too! Ownership will be shared between the workers and all of them will have a voice, either democratically making decisions or electing worker-managers who are still considered to be equals. Instead of primarily pursuing profit, cooperatives will seek to improve the lives of their own members."
BAL_incentives_for_collectivization:0 "Incentives For Collectivization"
BAL_incentives_for_collectivization_desc:0 "Using the threat of violence to force ponies to collectivize their property goes against our principles of voluntary associations and freedom from oppression. Instead of the stick we must use the carrot, and compensate smallholders and businessponies for their loss. We must also present socialism as a viable alternative to the capitalist economy that has just collapsed."
BAL_moneyless_economy:0 "A Moneyless Economy"
BAL_moneyless_economy_desc:0 "Now that there is peace, we can prepare more extensive reforms to create a currency-free society and an economy without a market. Money will become worthless, no longer accepted as a medium of exchange, as in the end it is merely paper or metal."
BAL_steel_mills:0 "Steel Mills Of Baltimare"
BAL_steel_mills_desc:0 "Steel is by far the most useful material in modern industry. The steelworkers of Baltimare are planning to expand their production so the entire country can be supplied with it. Other communes should aid their efforts in the name of solidarity, knowing it will benefit the society as a whole in the future."
BAL_according_to_contribution:0 "To Each According To Contribution"
BAL_according_to_contribution_desc:0 "We wish to create a society of justice, which means no one will unfairly receive more than others for doing less. Work will be compensated with labour vouchers which can then be exchanged for goods. This way our Republic will have no parasites leeching on others. Those simply incapable of work will be granted enough to fulfill their basic needs. The lazy can go and starve!"
BAL_connect_cities:0 "Connect The Cities"
BAL_connect_cities_desc:0 "The rough and forested terrain of south-eastern Equestria is an impediment to economic development and trade between cities, especially inland. While ships are a fine method of transport, they have lower capacity than modern trains. By investing in proper railways between our cities, we will enable further urban development across the region."
BAL_eradicate_bureaucracy:0 "Eradicate Bureaucracy"
BAL_eradicate_bureaucracy_desc:0 "As unions grow, so does their bureaucracy -- exponentially. The bloated bureaucracy then acts as an obstacle for true democracy and diminishes the power of the working class. The sole purpose in life of bureaucrats seems to be apologising for and defending the capitalist system of exploitation. As such, we must have the smallest possible bureaucracy, as efficient as it can be."
BAL_new_unions:0 "Found New Unions"
BAL_new_unions_desc:0 "There remain many sectors of industry with minimal union membership, or no unions at all. We must address this by founding new unions to represent workers of all kinds of professions, such as gunsmiths and dockworkers. Only then can we guarantee the emancipation of the entire working class."
BAL_horizontal_planning:0 "Horizontal Economic Planning"
BAL_horizontal_planning_desc:0 "Formulation and execution of economic plans is not the duty of some central authority above all, disconnected from the common workers. It is the democratic duty of everyone, shared between each union, each council, and ultimately each pony."
BAL_urbanization_program:0 "Urbanization Program"
BAL_urbanization_program_desc:0 "Despite our efforts some ponies on the countryside remain unconvinced of our cause, as we primarily focus on improving the lives of the urban workers. One solution is encouraging migration from farms and the plantations into the cities, where the quality of life and availability of services are higher. Investing in urban expansion is therefore important."
BAL_institute_of_science:0 "The Ponies' Institute Of Science"
BAL_institute_of_science_desc:0 "After our revolution, the south-east has lacked a center of education. We will found a new one, the country-wide Ponies' Institute of Science. Anyone can participate and study, no matter where they live or what their background is. While everyone won't graduate, all ponies will learn something new to improve their lives. Those who do graduate will be able to greatly contribute to society."
BAL_continue_nationalization:0 "Continue Nationalization"
BAL_continue_nationalization_desc:0 "While the civil war raged on, we did what we had to and nationalized private property as a temporary measure on the road to true communism. But the foolish libertarian socialists didn't realize that order was needed in the chaos and tried to sabotage us. Now that we are firmly in power, we can get back to assuming ownership of property in the name of the workers' state."
BAL_limited_market_economy:0 "A Limited Market Economy"
BAL_limited_market_economy_desc:0 "Our country is devastated after the brutal war. For quick growth and recovery, some changes in policy are necessary. We need elements of free market and capitalism, though both must remain under state control. Socialized state enterprises will from now on operate on a profit basis. Chafer assures everyone that this is merely a temporary measure on the path to communism."
BAL_investment_from_STG:0 "Investment From Stalliongrad"
BAL_investment_from_STG_desc:0 "Stalliongrad is an industrial powerhouse, and while their economy is not perfect they can still afford to invest in us, their reliable southern allies. We will guarantee them that their investments will be worthwhile, allowing us to grow and become strong. In return, we are willing to grant them a portion of our rubber production."
BAL_workers_councils:0 "Workers' Councils"
BAL_workers_councils_desc:0 "The formation of SESR has meant that government bureaucracy is too over-extended to manage the entire economy. Local workers' councils must be established, managing economies of individual administrative divisions and consisting of elected, revocable and temporary delegates elected in the workplaces of the area. They will, however, remain accountable to the Ponies' Parliament."
BAL_commissariat_of_defence:0 "Ponies' Commissariat Of Defence Industry"
BAL_commissariat_of_defence_desc:0 "A decree by the Ponies' Parliament hereby establishes the PCDI, responsible for managing and planning our military production. It will oversee all manufacturing plants whose primary responsibility is the construction of arms, aircraft, ships and ammunition, as well as design offices and weapons development facilities."
BAL_maize_the_miracle_crop:0 "Maize, The Miracle Crop"
BAL_maize_the_miracle_crop_desc:0 "Maize, otherwise known as corn, is a truly wonderful crop. Chafer has been singing its praises for many moons now, saying that we must plant it wherever possible. Thousands of acres of new farmland will be cleared for new farmland and our agricultural sector will boom, he claims. Some in the parliament are sceptical, but the results of this experiment will speak for themselves."
BAL_chaferovka:0 "Chaferyovka"
BAL_chaferovka_desc:0 "To keep our cities growing, more housing is needed. However, it is costly and labour-intensive to build, meaning the process is too slow to respond to increasing demand. Comrade Chafer has proposed a solution: prefabricated and cheap apartment buildings made mostly our of concrete or bricks mass-produced near the construction site."
BAL_two_year_plan:0 "Twenty-Year Plan"
BAL_two_year_plan_desc:0 "With the state now owning most means of production, it is the responsibility of the state to prepare an extensive plan for economic development and growth of the near future. In twenty years, [Root.GetLeader] claims, we will have true communism, with poverty eradicated and our prosperity surpassing that of capitalist nations."
BAL_oh_rubber_tree_oh_rubber_tree:0 "Expand Rubber Plantations"
BAL_oh_rubber_tree_oh_rubber_tree_desc:0 "Rubber is among the most valuable resources we have here in the south-eastern jungles. By clearing out forest and marshland for more state-owned tree plantations, we can increase its production even further. Soon enough we will be among the leading producers of rubber in the world, the envy of capitalists of other tropical nations."
BAL_expand_shipyards:0 "Construct New Shipyards"
BAL_expand_shipyards_desc:0 "Because of the poor infrastructure on land, most our transportation is naval. Not only that, but we must guard our flanks against naval invasion. Because of these reasons we need more ships, and because of that we need more shipyards to build them."
BAL_connect_the_state:0 "Connect The State"
BAL_connect_the_state_desc:0 "The central government has a hard time reaching some of the more isolated areas of the south-east because of the thick undergrowth and a lack of roads through it. This must be addressed at once and new projects must begin where the jungle is cleared for roads and railways."
BAL_university_of_baltimare:0 "The University Of Baltimare"
BAL_university_of_baltimare_desc:0 "The state has plans to officially open a new facility of education in the capital, under the patronage of [Root.GetLeader] himself. It will be the primary place of higher education in the nation, attracting students from every town and village, some of which will hopefully graduate and contribute to the greatness of our state."
BAL_economic_autarky:0 "Economic Autarky"
BAL_economic_autarky_desc:0 "We cannot be reliant on others. We can only rely on ourselves. Everything we need can be produced domestically. The State can sustain itself. It needs no other. Others are merely potential enemies. They cannot be relied upon. They cannot be trusted. We have only ourselves."
BAL_direct_economic_control:0 "Direct Economic Control"
BAL_direct_economic_control_desc:0 "The status of the economy is of vital importance to the State. The State must ensure the economy remains healthy. It will suffer no interference. No deviancy from its plans. The State will bring prosperity to all who remain loyal to it."
BAL_repurpose_factories:0 "Repurpose Factories"
BAL_repurpose_factories_desc:0 "Too much of our industrial capacity is used for vanities. It is a remnant of capitalism under despicable Celestia. It will be cleansed. Citizens will only have what they truly need. No excess. No gluttony. The facilities will become forges of products needed for the survival of the State. Guns. Bullet. Bombs. And much more."
BAL_efficient_job_assignment:0 "Efficient Job Assignment"
BAL_efficient_job_assignment_desc:0 "Ponies have talent marks gained in youth which indicate their preferred duties. It is inefficient to have ponies following their passions. The State must assign necessary tasks to ponies capable of doing them. Ponies will work on what they need to work, not on what they desire to work."
BAL_weather_micromanagement:0 "Weather Micromanagement"
BAL_weather_micromanagement_desc:0 "Pegasi are able to control to weather to some extent. This ability is not utilized as much as it could be. Pegasus citizens must be drafted into weather-management battalions. They will ensure favourable weather for agriculture and military operations. The effect on the local fauna and flora will be disregarded."
BAL_impose_strict_quotas:0 "Impose Strict Quotas"
BAL_impose_strict_quotas_desc:0 "Overconsumption by our citizens is a waste of resources. We will not tolerate waste. Some citizens are prone to sloth. We will not tolerate indolence. The State is efficient. Its citizens must be equally efficient. Every pony will fulfill their quotas of labour. No pony will exceed their quotas of consumption.\n\nGlory to the South-East."

BAL_decentralized_militia:0 "A Decentralized Militia"
BAL_decentralized_militia_desc:0 "A single united army would be a dangerous idea, for its leaders would be too powerful. Who can guarantee they would not abuse their power? Therefore we must have a true army of the common ponies, compromised of part-time militia who make up for their lack of skill with their dedication to defend their homeland."
BAL_everypony_armed:0 "Everypony Armed And Ready"
BAL_everypony_armed_desc:0 "Because every member of our society owns a weapon, everyone is able to participate in the defence of our communes from foreign reactionary aggression, and in offence, liberating others from their capitalist shackles. Together, we can crush our foes and safeguard liberty to the last."
BAL_we_fight_for_freedom:0 "We Fight For Freedom!"
BAL_we_fight_for_freedom_desc:0 "The soldiers of other, despotic countries fight for money, or they fight because they are forced to do so. But we ponies of the south-east fight for liberty. We fight against oppression and hierarchy, against inequality and tyranny. Our cause is noble, and we must all remember this and be emboldened."
BAL_native_auxiliaries:0 "Native Auxiliaries"
BAL_native_auxiliaries_desc:0 "The natives who we have befriended want to participate in the defence of our confederation. There is no reason to forbid them from doing so. In fact, we can provide them modern arms and equipment, and in return they can guide us through the jungles, showing us secret paths behind the lines of the invading enemy."
BAL_union_militia:0 "Labour Union Militia"
BAL_union_militia_desc:0 "Every trade union member is allowed to wield weapons, but we should allow the unions to form organized military units as well to increase the fighting capability of the members. Having worked together in civilian life, they will be eager to fight side by side in times of war."
BAL_armory_of_the_revolution:0 "Armoury Of The Revolution"
BAL_armory_of_the_revolution_desc:0 "Modern wars are not won by numbers alone, but by superior weaponry and the application of overwhelming firepower. Our factories and workshops are ready to churn out all kinds of heavy guns to give us an edge in battle. Long live the revolution of the working class!"
BAL_combat_engineers:0 "Combat Engineers"
BAL_combat_engineers_desc:0 "Our unions have many engineers among their ranks. They too should join our militias and participate in war, but by fighting on the front-line. Instead, they will put their knowledge to use, destroying enemy fortifications, constructing bridges and repairing infrastructure."
BAL_in_defence_of_workers:0 "The Workers' Cause"
BAL_in_defence_of_workers_desc:0 "We are not alone in this world. We cannot forget about the workers of the world and their struggle for emancipation. No, we must aid them when we can, and defend our own revolution from reactionary aggression. Fighting side by side with our comrades, we may perhaps one day realize our dream of a free proletarian world."
BAL_repurpose_fishing_boats:0 "Repurpose Fishing Boats"
BAL_repurpose_fishing_boats_desc:0 "To defend our coasts, we need ships. Instead of making them from scratch, we should arm our fishing vessels and other civilian ships. They won't make the most fearsome vessels of war, but they will suffice for coastal defence."
BAL_repurpose_mail_planes:0 "Repurpose Mail Planes"
BAL_repurpose_mail_planes_desc:0 "There are numerous planes in civilian use in the south-east, primarily carrying mail and passengers. Their owners have joined our militia and now ask for weapons for their aircraft, so they can fly them during times of war and defend our skies."
BAL_militia_air_support:0 "Militia Air Support"
BAL_militia_air_support_desc:0 "If we manage to secure control of the skies above our militiaponies, we have an opportunity to offer them aerial support. For this task we should develop airplanes capable of providing such aid as effectively as possible."
BAL_red_cruisers:0 "Armed Merchant Ships"
BAL_red_cruisers_desc:0 "War is a threat to our maritime shipping. If we don't want our trade with other countries to be endangered, we must repurpose some of our merchant ships into warships, so they can defend others on the sea."
BAL_integrate_coltjuns:0 "Integrate Coltjun Militia"
BAL_integrate_coltjuns_desc:0 "The Coltjun ponies of Hayseed Swamps immigrated from Aquileia many years ago and have developed their own distinct culture. Part of this culture is their unique style of guerilla warfare which they used to defend their homes during the war against thestrals. We should integrate their militia into our main forces and learn their tactics."
BAL_better_guns:0 "Gifts From Our Comrades"
BAL_better_guns_desc:0 "Other revolutionaries of the world are happy to see our revolution succeed and sent shipments of weapons. Now they have finally arrived in the port of Baltimare and we will gladly receive this generous gift. The arms will be distributed to our military and any excess will be safely stored in our stockpiles."
BAL_bigger_guns:0 "Destroying Reactionaries From Afar"
BAL_bigger_guns_desc:0 "Ensuring we take as few casualties as possible during war is vital. Because of this, we should strive to win battles before even engaging our enemy directly. This is made possible by long-ranged weaponry, which we therefore need to produce for our military."
BAL_support_companies:0 "Support Company Development"
BAL_support_companies_desc:0 "For our soldiers to fight effectively, they need various kinds of support from trained specialists, such as engineers, medics, scouts and mages. This way they can fight with increased effectiveness and take fewer losses in battle. We should focus on training such specialists for our military."
BAL_army_mechanization:0 "Military Mechanization"
BAL_army_mechanization_desc:0 "Modern technology enables increasingly rapid warfare and improved logistics, made possible by self-moving vehicles which will replace pony-drawn wagons of old. While their usage in the jungles is questionable, with improved roads our forces could benefit from mechanization greatly."
BAL_armoured_warfare:0 "Armoured Warfare"
BAL_armoured_warfare_desc:0 "Landships, also known as tanks, are another revolutionary weapon of our age. Covered in thick plating, they can withstand more punishment than regular vehicles, and with their all-terrain tracks they can overcome most obstacles. Their firepower is nothing to scoff at either. Clearly, our workers must build new tanks which we must put into active use."
BAL_centralized_army:0 "A Centralized Army"
BAL_centralized_army_desc:0 "A single united army is needed for our survival. Only with strict order of battle and an organized command structure can we resist aggression from powerful neighbours. We must rely on the talent of the topmost commanders, for our strategy is in their hooves."
BAL_state_planned_warfare:0 "Department Of War Planning"
BAL_state_planned_warfare_desc:0 "The Ministry Of Defence must be expanded. A new department will be founded. It will be dedicated to formulating detailed plans for future wars. They will take every scenario into account. We must be prepared for anything. Only then can we defeat our reactionary foes."
BAL_disciplined_ranks:0 "Discipline In The Ranks"
BAL_disciplined_ranks_desc:0 "We will not tolerate those who disregard orders. Who do not faithfully obey their commanders. Who are not ready to die for their State. Our officers will be granted the right to punish dissident filth most severely. Our army must be the zenith of order. They will march to battle and death as one."
BAL_for_the_state:0 "For The State!"
BAL_for_the_state_desc:0 "There is no greater fate than perishing for your State. It is the ultimate sacrifice. One we must all be willing to make when the time comes. Our valiant deaths in battle will bring victory. Our victory will keep our State safe.\n\nGlory to the South-East."
BAL_dominate_sea:0 "Dominate The Seas"
BAL_dominate_sea_desc:0 "The sea belong to the State as much as the land does. We must defend it with equal vigor. Our shipwrights must be put to work making the most powerful and mighty warships ever seen. They will destroy any who enter our seas with malicious intent. The ocean will be their grave."
BAL_heavy_aircraft:0 "Heavy Aircraft Development"
BAL_heavy_aircraft_desc:0 "Only proper, dedicated military aircraft can be strong enough to secure air superiority even when outnumbered. Fighters with twin engines and metal frames will sustain more damage and be able to fly further. They will also be adaptable and capable of completing a variety of missions. Our airplane factories will get to work at once."
BAL_death_from_above:0 "Death From Above"
BAL_death_from_above_desc:0 "After we have wrested control of the airspace with our fighters, our bombers can get to work. They will be able to not only target enemy soldiers and supply lines, but more strategic targets as well, destroying factories and terror bombing civilian habitation. Such planes would greatly augment our airforce."
BAL_empower_mis:0 "Empower The MIS"
BAL_empower_mis_desc:0 "The Military Investigation Service has a vital purpose in guarding the nation. With more rights granted to them, they will be able to fulfill their duty more efficiently, identifying threats and gathering vital intelligence needed for our survival."
BAL_air_sea_war:0 "Air-Sea War"
BAL_air_sea_war_desc:0 "Increased use of airplanes has not only revolutionized warfare on ground, but on water as well. Aircraft are predicted to ultimately be more effective than ships themselves at sea, but have a more limited range. Therefore we should invest in constructing carrier vessels, capable of transporting and supplying aircraft over long distances."
BAL_stalliongradian_doctrine:0 "Stalliongradian Doctrine"
BAL_stalliongradian_doctrine_desc:0 "Over the last decade Stalliongrad has focused heavily on developing its innovative doctrine of mobile warfare, utilizing motorized infantry and armoured tanks to break through enemy lines and perform rapid encirclements. We should learn from them and adopt similar stratagems for our military."
BAL_thestral_battalions:0 "Thestral Battalions"
BAL_thestral_battalions_desc:0 "Now that the lunarist resistance has been pacified, Light Narrative has proposed we form dedicated battalions consisting entirely of thestrals, mostly veterans of the war. This way we can not only keep an eye on them, but benefit from their experience and use it as a propaganda tool to prove to everyone that bat ponies are proud citizens of the SESR."
BAL_commissar_training:0 "Commissar Training"
BAL_commissar_training_desc:0 "Many commissars among the ranks of our army are purely political ones who have received minimal proper military training. We must address this at once and turn them into more effective supporting officers, who not only maintain a revolutionary fervour in the ranks but also issue useful commands."

BAL_economic_chaos:0 "Economic Chaos"
BAL_economic_chaos_desc:0 "Following the beginning of the civil war, occupation by lunarists and the recent revolution, the economy of Baltimare is in tatters. Trade links which kept the city's industry alive have been severed and the country is surrounded on all sides by hostiles. Things are not made better by the fact that socialists and anarchists have forcefully nationalized or collectivized farms and factories without establishing proper management for them."
BAL_economic_chaos2:0 "Economic Chaos"
BAL_economic_chaos2_desc:0 "Thanks to hasty economic reforms, some semblance of order has been introduced to the economy and production rates have increased. But many issues remain which hurt the efficiency of most facilities."
BAL_economic_chaos3:0 "Economic Chaos"
BAL_economic_chaos3_desc:0 "Further reforms and policy changes have completely restructured the economy, which has helped with both production and distribution.

BAL_military_disarray_desc:0 "The "army" of Baltimare, if you can call it that, consists entirely of worker militias who have no formal military training and a small amount of experience they got from driving out the lunarist occupiers.

BAL_military_disarray2:0 "Military Disarray"

BAL_military_disarray3_desc:0 "The army is in a much better shape, which capable officers spread evenly among the ranks in a well-planned command structure.

BAL_self_managed_factories:0 "Workers' Self-Management"
BAL_self_managed_factories_desc:0 "Factories and farms are being collectivized, with the former capitalists and managers being removed out of the picture.

baltimare.1.t:0 "The Spark of Revolution"
baltimare.1.d:0 "As the Baltimare Radio broadcasted sounds of chaos in Canterlot, the thestrals living in the outskirts of the city began rioting. When a battalion of armed bat ponies appeared from the jungle, carrying a black banner of the moon, the rioters and Mayor Ash Moustache welcomed them. He was a good friend of the mayor of Manehattan and was sympathetic to the plight of the thestrals. But the lunarists soon realized they were in a city that was openly hostile to them.\n\nBaltimare had been a center of the labour union movement for decades and was the headquarters of the nation-wide workers' organization CAN-TER. The unions of factory workers, dockworkers and sailors of the city had always pushed for better pay and fairer working conditions, which the mayor had been reluctant to grant in fear of losing profits. When the ponies of Stalliongrad rose up in arms, a general strike took place in Baltimare as a sign of support. The mayor responded by sending in the police to violently suppress it. Though Princess Celestia removed her from office afterwards and Mayor Ash Moustache replaced her after elections, the damage had been done: many workers could no longer trust the government and were pushed to radicalism. Stalliongrad was happy to support them as secret stashes of weapons were gathered in preparation for revolution.\n\nNow that distrusted bat ponies tried to take over the city and impose strict war-time curfews and poor working conditions on the workers, the time for revolution had come. Militias were formed and stockpiled weapons were put to use. The thestrals were driven out and the Mayor imprisoned, his government dissolved. The militia drove onwards, liberating the forests around Baltimare, before they had to stop.\n\nThe military was now in complete disarray and so was the economy. Different unions and parties had their own militias that did not cooperate and had a complete lack of discipline, some workers collectivized factories and farms while others nationalized them. Capitalism was crushed as soon as possible, with no regard to what chaos it would cause. Now that the lunarists were gathering their forces on the frontline, it was clear something had to be done to prevent the revolution from collapsing into itself."
baltimare.1.a:0 "We must stand united against reactionaries!"
baltimare.2.t:0 "The First Session of the Congress"
baltimare.2.d:0 "The old city hall, once the home of Mayor Ash Moustache, was now filled to the brim with representatives of the numerous revolutionary factions within Baltimare. Together they formed the Popular Front, a political coalition and the only legal party within Baltimare, at least for now. The Congress was meant to be a temporary war-time government and thus monarchists and republicans were not allowed to be in it as they were suspected of being supporters of the Celestial State or Ash Moustache.\n\nOut of the myriad parties and organizations in the Popular Front, the most notable ones were the anarcho-syndicalist CAN-TER, communist PON and stallionist IU. CAN was an organization of anarchist militants closely affiliated with TER, but have so far been very reluctant about participating in the statist Congress. TER was a country-wide confederation of labour unions whose headquarters were in Baltimare. PON was a communist party supported by Stalliongrad and lead by Cricket Chafer, a veteran of the Winter Revolution, while IU was a fringe party of stallionists who believed a powerful state was needed to make true communism possible. Its leader Lavender Berry was a shady figure and a former policepony, who had defected, betrayed his fellow officers and revealed his secret membership in IU.\n\nDuring the first session, Golden Delicious of TER, who lead the offensive which drove the reactionary thestrals out of Baltimare, has been elected to be the provisional chairpony of the Congress. In addition a draft of a new constitution for the Republic was made and several social reforms were passed."
baltimare.2.a:0 "We're off to a good start."
baltimare.3.t:0 "Revolution In Baltimare"
baltimare.3.d:0 "Recently news of revolution in south-eastern part of war-embroiled Equestria arrived in Sicameon. The formation of a socialist republic in Baltimare pleased the radicals and the syndicalists, for the city was the headquarters of Equestria's largest confederation of labour unions, CAN-TER. Some were so enthusiastic of this that they were eager to travel abroad and aid their equine comrades in their struggle. Among them is the writer Jorge Orellana, former teacher known for his left-leaning novels. He said that he desired to go fight against the monarchist supporters who opposed the young republic, and was confident in his own combat abilities."
baltimare.3.a:0 "Let us hope they all return in one piece."
baltimare.4.t:0 "Support From Sicameon"
baltimare.4.d:0 "Having heard of our revolution, syndicalists and radicals from the Federated Parishes of Sicameon have now arrived across the sea to support us in our struggle for freedom against monarchist oppressors. Among them is the writer Jorge Orellana, who was eager to fight. He has received training in the Sicameonese militia and Comrade Delicious has proposed promoting him, because we have a severe lack of capable officers."
baltimare.4.a:0 "Welcome, comrades!"
baltimare.5.t:0 "A Request From Baltimare"
baltimare.5.d:0 "Cricket Chafer, the leader of the communist PON party in Baltimare, has send us a secret telegram asking for our aid. He says their revolutionary struggle could benefit greatly from us sending our finest minds to act as advisors. While there, they could also work to sideline the counter-revolutionary anarchists and syndicalists in the Baltimare Congress.\n\nHowever, he did not specify what kind of advisors to send, so it is up to the politburo to decide. Should we send political advisors such as Gold Muffin and Spike Spiegel to boost their morale and ensure communist principles are followed closely, or should we send military advisors such as Sofia and Nevsky to whip their soldiers into shape? Should we even send anyone? Baltimare is a dangerous war zone, after all."
baltimare.5.a:0 "We shall send Gold Muffin and Spike Spiegel."
baltimare.5.b:0 "We shall send Sofia and Nevsky."

Escorted by several ships of the Red Navy, two advisors have arrived from Stalliongrad in the harbour of Baltimare: Gold Muffin, a communist changeling who is a refugee from Chrysalis' Queendom and a popular figure among the socialists of Equestria, as well as Spike Spiegel, one of the ponies responsible for the economic planning of Stalliongrad's military production. They have expressed their eagerness to aid us in our struggle."
baltimare.6.d_sofia_nevsky:0 "Good news! Escorted by several ships of the Red Navy, two advisors have arrived from Stalliongrad in the harbour of Baltimare: Sofia, a high-ranking veteran of the Winter Revolution and an expert on mobile warfare, and Nevsky, an officer known for his skillful management of logistics. They have expressed their eagerness to aid us in our struggle."
baltimare.6.d_refused:0 "Unfortunately, a telegram from Stalliongrad has been received that states they do not wish to send their advisors to an active warzone. They did say that other avenues for cooperation remained open and would be happy to send advisors after the end of hostilities, but already this has made it harder to trust our supposed comrades up north."
baltimare.6.a:0 "Their help is appreciated."
baltimare.6.b:0 "Their help is appreciated."
baltimare.6.c:0 "Our "comrades" have left us on our own..."
baltimare.7.t:0 "The Second Session of the Congress"
baltimare.7.d:0 "The Congress has once again gathered in the town hall of Baltimare, and has this time allowed its former occupant Ash Moustache to enter. He will hear what his fate will be, once the Congress comes to an agreement.\n\nAfter an hour of heated debate, three proposals proved to be most popular: Pardoning the mayor in the name of harmony, for he could not have known that the lunarist occupiers would be so harsh and simply wished to help the discriminated thestral minority. Some even said Baltimare Republic could benefit from his aid, for he is a well-behaved gentlecolt with diplomatic talent.\n\nAnother, seemingly the most popular proposal was punishing the mayor by humiliating and banishing him. This would not only discredit the old regime, but also remove a potential collaborator from the country. Those who opposed this idea, mostly anarchists and members of IU, feared that he would simply flee to the Celestial supporters and form a government in exile, and instead supported a most severe punishment: Death by firing squad."
baltimare.7.a:0 "Forgive and forget."
baltimare.7.b:0 "Humiliating him sounds fun!"
baltimare.7.c:0 "Shoot the bastard!"
baltimare.8.t:0 "The Mayor of Baltimare Arrives"
baltimare.8.d:0 "The deposed mayor of Baltimare, Ash Moustache, has recently arrived in Portland on a ship. He tells us that he was banished from his home city after a trial before the illegitimate socialist Congress. When our ponies questioned why he had no clothes, was completely shaved like a sheep and was covered in rotten eggs, he blushed and was reluctant to say what happened. Apparently he had been punished for collaborating with lunarists with public humiliation.\n\nHe is now on his way to Stableside, and has assured us he has been disillusioned with the supporters of Nightmare Moon after their occupation turned out to be more ruthless than he had expected. He was more than happy to come to our aid, as long as we provide him with new clothes. With the mayor now safely in our control, [Root.GetLeader] can ask him to form a government-in-exile for the city of Baltimare."
baltimare.8.a:0 "We'll save Baltimare soon, don't worry."
baltimare.9.t:0 "Baltimare Executes Their Mayor"
baltimare.9.d:0 "News have arrived that the radical socialist revolutionaries of the Baltimare Republic have publicly executed their deposed mayor Ash Moustache. They at least had the mercy to do it with a firing squad. The mayor had been accused of collaborating with the lunarist occupiers and was deemed guilty, but this punishment seems rather severe, especially considering Ash Moustache was known to be a compassionate gentlecolt who simply wished to aid the discriminated thestral minority in Baltimare.\n\nThe Baltimare Republic has revealed its true face as a cold-blooded killer who will not hesitate to eliminate those they see as a threat. They have clearly completely abandoned harmony and friendship, so we should not even attempt to negotiate with them."
baltimare.9.a:0 "They will pay for what they've done..."
baltimare.10.t:0 "Preparing A Request"
baltimare.10.d:0 "The Congress has gathered once again in Baltimare's city hall to decide what kind of military equipment we should request from our comrades. Golden Delicious says many ponies in the trade unions are eager to fight, but unable to do so because of a lack of rifles, helmets and other infantry equipment. Cricket Chafer on the other hoof said that they had enough rifles and such for now, and should request more expensive artillery guns, which we have a dire lack of. With them, we can level the jungles and blast the bats from afar. Lavender Berry then made a more unusual proposal, saying we should ask for fighter planes. With control of the sky, we could dominate the battlefield and mow down our helpless, fleeing foes from above with impunity."
baltimare.10.a:0 "We need equipment for our militia!"
baltimare.10.b:0 "With big guns, we'll destroy the reactionaries!"
baltimare.10.c:0 "If we rule the sky with planes, we will gain an advantage."
baltimare.11.t:0 "Baltimare Asks For Equipment"
baltimare.11.d_bal_rifles:0 "An urgent telegram has arrived from the Workers' Republic of Baltimare, who are embroiled in a dire conflict with reactionaries. They are humbly asking for us to send them rifles, helmet, granades and other infantry equipment, so they can raise more troops for battle. While it is clear we should generously aid our comrades, we should consider if we can afford to do so. Our own military remains the highest priority for us."
baltimare.11.d_bal_guns:0 "An urgent telegram has arrived from the Workers' Republic of Baltimare, who are embroiled in a dire conflict with reactionaries. They are humbly asking for us to send them heavy guns, which they have a complete lack of. With them, they could easily destroy their ill-equipped foes from afar. While it is clear we should generously aid our comrades, we should consider if we can afford to do so. Our own military remains the highest priority for us."
baltimare.11.d_bal_planes:0 "An urgent telegram has arrived from the Workers' Republic of Baltimare, who are embroiled in a dire conflict with reactionaries. They are humbly asking for us to send them fighter planes, so they can secure air superiority and gain a considerable advantage against their enemies. While it is clear we should generously aid our comrades, we should consider if we can afford to do so. Our own military remains the highest priority for us."
baltimare.11.a:0 "Of course, prepare a shipment immediately!"
baltimare.11.b:0 "We cannot afford to send anything right now."
baltimare.12.t:0 "A Shipment From Petershoof"
baltimare.12.d_bal_rifles:0 "An escorted shipment of infantry equipment has arrived in the harbour of Baltimare and our workers are already unloading the cargo. Stalliongrad has sent us plenty of rifles, helmets, bullets and more, proving that we can truly trust in them and their generous support."
baltimare.12.d_bal_guns:0 "An escorted shipment of artillery equipment has arrived in the harbour of Baltimare and our workers are already unloading the cargo.

baltimare.12.d_bal_planes:0 "An escorted shipment of fighter planes has arrived in the harbour of Baltimare and our workers are already unloading the cargo. Stalliongrad has sent us plenty of high-grade aircraft recently made in their factories, proving that we can truly trust in them and their generous support."
baltimare.12.a:0 "Thank you, comrades!"
baltimare.13.t:0 "No Aid From Stalliongrad"
baltimare.13.d:0 "We have received a response to the telegram we sent to Stalliongrad, and its message is not pleasant. Apparently Stalliongrad, despite having numerous military factories and a vast military compared to ours, cannot "afford" to send any equipment we requested. Those who proposed this idea are now being mocked in the Congress."
baltimare.13.a:0 "How can communists be as greedy as capitalists?!"
baltimare.14.t:0 "Down With The Princesses!"
baltimare.14.d:0 ""No more princesses, the pedestals shall fall!"\n\nSlogans such as this echoed on the streets of Baltimare as a mass rally against monarchism was organized. Propaganda about the corruption, incompetence and even cruelty of Celestia, Luna, Cadance and Twilight was blasted with loudspeakers and any statues of alicorns toppled and defaced. Grafitti art of an obese Celestia gorging on cake soon decorated walls and Luna was referred to as "Lunatic". Some known supporters of the princesses were dragged out of their homes, then humiliated, mocked and beaten for their childish delusions. The largest statue, depicting Celestia and standing in the central square of the city, was blindfolded by a pegasus, then theatrically "executed" by a firing squad, and finally detonated with dynamite.\n\nAnarchists and communists, syndicalists and socialists, all participated in the event, for once united as one."
baltimare.14.a:0 "End to monarchism!"
baltimare.15.t:0 "Anti-Monarchist Rally In Baltimare"
baltimare.15.d:0 "News are spreading to us about a peculiar event in Baltimare, as supporters of Celestia and Luna both flee the city in terror. The leftists of the city organized a large event dedicated entirely to discredit the institution of monarchy, to mock the princesses, and to beat up those ponies who remained loyal to them. Grafitti art of an obese Celestia gorging on cake decorated walls and Luna was referred to as "Lunatic". Any monuments depicting the princesses were toppled and defaced. The most curious example was the theatrical "execution" and the following demolition of the large statue of Princess Celestia standing in the central square of Baltimare."
baltimare.15.a:0 "They have gone astray..."
baltimare.16.t:0 "The Purge"
baltimare.16.d:0 "The official reason for the violence was suppressing potential counter-revolutionary opposition to the regime of the Congress. But the real reasons were far more varied: Fear, paranoia, revenge, built-up anger, distrust and more. In any case, it was blatantly against the values of friendship and harmony which had so recently been abandoned in Baltimare.\n\nAnarchist mobs, syndicalist and communist militias, death squads of the IU, all attacked perceived reactionaries without mercy, everywhere in the Republic. Former landowners, businessponies, factory bosses, monarchists and more were violently abused, sent to internment camps or simply executed without trial. The violence especially focused on thestrals, who were seen as lunarist sympathisers and supporters of tyrannical Commander Stars Whirl. Temples of the natives in Kululu Forest were looted and burnt down, and priests hunted. Religion had no place in a revolutionary republic either, and the "sun god" of the natives was seen as a ridiculous culmination of naive Celestia-worship.\n\nAfter a week, some socialists began to realize they had gone too far. Golden Delicious and Cricket Chafer urged their militiaponies to stand down and end the violence, yet few obeyed immediately. It took many more bloodied days before it finally stopped."

baltimare.17.a:0 "Those monsters!"
baltimare.18.t:0 "Anti-Anarchist Crackdown"
baltimare.18.d:0 "Today PON and IU managed to push a controversial piece of legislation through the Congress: All private arms were now forbidden, and a powerful "non-political" police force would be formed, separate from trade union militias. This made anarchists and syndicalists so outraged that they marched out of the city hall in protest, but there was nothing they could now do.\n\nThe law was immediately enforced on the next day. Lavender Berry became the head of the newly established Baltimare Police which immediately went to work disarming anarchists and syndicalists away from the frontline. Understandably, many of them feared that this was but the first step, and that the next step would be dismantling all communes and industrial committees as well as nationalizing remaining collectives, so the resistance to the disarmament was fierce. Fighting broke out in Baltimare itself as anarchists refused to give up their weapons. Golden Delicious demanded the immediate removal of Lavender Berry from office, while Cricket Chafer tried to broker a ceasefire between the two sides, fearing it would escalate, spread and tear their young nation in half.\n\nAfter seveal days of chaos, all parties in the Congress appealed to the fighters to stand down and the fighting dissipated. Thousands of anarcho-syndicalists were arrested, many of them members in Congress. Soon Golden Delicious realized most of his supporters now sat behind bars."

baltimare.19.t:0 "Defanging The Congress"
baltimare.19.d:0 "Today CAN and TER managed to push a controversial piece of legislation through the Congress: Many responsibilities and powers of the body would be delegated to lower levels of government, to local municipalities and communes. This made communists and state socialists so outraged that they marched out of the city hall in protest, but there was nothing they could now do.\n\nThe law immediately went to effect and communes formed their own councils. They were now responsible for their own legislation, healthcare, law enforcement, military, education and so on. In fact, the Congress was left with so little power that most communists no longer saw any reason to stay in it and resigned. Several protests to this change arrived from Stalliongrad, which feared that the revolution was now critically endangered. Fresh militiapony recruits found this strange as they joined the reserves of Baltimare, ready to take up arms and defend their homes more eagerly than ever before."

Congratulations arrive from all socialist parties of the world and communist nations race to recognize our country as legitimate. Stalliongrad is already setting up an embassy in Baltimare. The temprorary Congress had its last session where it formally dissolved itself and formed a national Ponies' Parliament to succeed it. Elections would soon take place.\n\nBut the peace won't last forever. It is certain we will have to fight for our freedom and independence as counter-revolutionary ideas continue to prevail abroad.

A thousand arrived, 612 are now preparing to leave back home, among them Jorge Orellana who saw action in battle. He took part in repulsing a thestral night attack, chased a native with a bayonet and bombed a Celestial loyalist trench with a grenade. Unfortunately, near the end of the war he was wounded by a sniper's bullet. While he was able to continue acting in command, he no longer fought in person, and has now received medical treatment by Mage Meadowbrook herself.\n\nHe has promised to Golden Delicious, who had become his good friend during the war, that he would write a novel based on his experiences while he waited for his wound to fully healed."

baltimare.22.d:0 "Today, the provisional government has proclaimed the establishment of the South-Eastern Socialist Republic, the sole legitimate state on the peninsula. While some regarded the news with scepticism and pessimism, most of the urban populace in the south-east has wholeheartedly welcomed the revolution. Working conditions during the war have been unbearable in most places, so the promises of workers' ownership of production and fewer working hours have pleased many. New democratic workers' councils and committees are already being established across the peninsula.\n\nHowever, the largely untamed countryside remains a different matter. Native tribes, ignorant of socialism, view it as a foreign threat that wishes to eradicate their way of life. Thestrals, distrusted by Baltimareans and persecuted in many cities, are preparing to wage guerilla warfare in the jungles. Many Equestrian settlers who live on farms especially near Stableside look forward to land reform, but those who own the most land are afraid it will all be taken away from them.\n\nIt is clear more work has to be done for the entire populace to be turned to our side, but this is only the beginning."

baltimare.23.d:0 "Today was supposed to be the day when elections were held. Voting ballots had been prepared across the country and political campaigning had lasted for weeks. But the anarchists of CAN had different ideas.\n\nMasked militants raided voting stations across the country, burned ballot papers and vandalized government buildings which had only recently been occupied by workers' councils. Many of the militants belonged to SESR's revolutionary army, and thus there was little opposition strong enough to stop them.\n\nWhen the anarchists realized that no one would stop them, their actions escalated. They spread out from city to city, overthrowing any nascent governmental institutions that had been established in recent weeks, and made their way towards Baltimare. There, a small battle was fought before Golden Delicious intervened and ordered his loyal militiaponies to stand down and end the bloodshed. He convinced Cricket Chafer to flee the country and entered negotiations with the anarchists.\n\nSeveral days later, the SESR turned out to be stillborn as it was formally dismantled. The Ponies' Parliament was no more, and any remaining military units had to either join the anarchist militias or give up their weapons. The rule of government and state in the south-east had ended."

But then, while speaking in Stableside to a large audience, Golden Delicious was shot and killed by an unknown assailant. He had been one of the most popular candidates for the position of chairpony and the leader of the anarcho-syndicalist TER organisation which was participating in the elections like a regular party. His death resulted in a plummet of support for TER, so the other popular candidate, Cricket Chafer, was confident in his victory. Indeed when the election results finally came in, he won by a landslide and his party, PON, took control of the Parliament.\n\nBut on the following day something strange happened. Cricket announced in public that he would step down, and that a coalition would be formed between PON and IU. He said that there had been an attempt on his life and was now so afraid that he would abandon politics and retire back to his maize farm near Saltlickingham. The police chief Lavender Berry would assume temporary control over the government.\n\nWhat followed was a widespread purge of the parliament and the military. Almost all members of PON party as well as many anarcho-syndicalists were arrested, suspected of participating in the murder of Golden Delicious, leaving stallionist IU the sole party in control. Lavender Berry also assumed emergency powers which he claimed were needed to ensure the guilty were found and put to justice."

Due to the country needing all kinds of leaders on all levels, parliamentary elections and elections for the chairpony were held simultaneously. Voting ballots had been prepared across the country and political campaigning had lasted for weeks. Of course, there were plenty of complaints that all the ponies running for office were socialists, communists or trade union members, but they still represented diverse values and as such most eligible voters found some representative they largely agreed with.\n\nWhile the candidates for both the Ponies' Parliament and the position of chairpony were numerous, in the end it became clear that two parties and two ponies dominated the vote: Golden Delicious of TER and Cricket "Pig" Chafer of PON. Both had gained fame during the fighting and were liked for their more moderate, reformist policies which appealed to those who were sceptical about socialism. Golden was an anarcho-syndicalist and strived for federalism and libertarian policies, while Cricket was a more traditional communist who nevertheless favoured a slow and patient transition to communism with the wise guidance of the state.\n\nAfter the first round of voting only these two remained. The second round would decide who would lead the nation for the near future."

The book is fictional and describes a dystopian society that exists in the year 1048, simply known as The State. It controls all of Equus while two other superpowers control Griffonia and Zebrica. All three are in perpetual war, and The State, though nominally socialist, is a totalitarian government that uses magic for extensive surveillance, propaganda and brainwashing. The MARESOC party of New Mareland has sued him for slander, though he claims he was unaware of the party's existence and instead based the novel on his experiences in the Baltimare Republic, where PON and IU implemented increasingly authoritarian policies."

baltimare.29.t:0 "The Hunt"
baltimare.29.d:0 "The lunarists thought that they could effectively oppose the victorious socialists by waging guerilla war from their jungle hideouts and mountain caverns. Yet they were unaware that anarchist militants themselves were competent at asymmetrical warfare, and that several Neighua warchiefs volunteered to aid them against the thestrals, their mortal enemies.\n\nWith help and guidance from the natives, bands of anarchist militants entered the jungles and a deadly game of cat and mouse began. Both sides attempted to use ambushes, traps and snipers, and the only difference between the tactics of the two sides was that the anarchists fought during the day while bats fought during the night.\n\nMuch blood was shed on both sides, but eventually Stars Whirl, the defacto leader of the lunarists, died in a surprise attack. The leadership structure of the bats began to collapse as they had relied on the rigid hierarchy to lead them, but anarchists had no such issues. The lunarists found no high-ranking leaders to target, no hierarchy to collapse. There was none, after all.\n\nSoon most resistance had withered away and thousands of thestrals were taken prisoner. Neighua tribes celebrated and praised the anarchists for their valiant effort. The defenseless bat pony civilians then fled the South-East en masse, their homes being looted and burned by anarchists who saw them as Lunar loyalists and monarchist scum. Tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands crossed the border, taking all they could carry with them. Many died on the way."

baltimare.30.d:0 "Chieftains and chieftesses of all native tribes travelled to an ancient, forgotten temple in the middle of the peninsula to meet with elected representatives of the south-eastern anarchist communes. They were split into two groups, the Neighua tribes, and the Mareyans and Coltecs. Meetings were held with each separately, but similar things were agreed upon.\n\nThe anarchists would respect the natives' right to self-determination and allow them to retain their traditional (and largely ceremonial) chiefs and chieftains, and in return the tribes would agree to send representatives to the confederal congress whenever it was convened, to aid in the defence of the Free South-East against reactionary invaders and to consider extended collectivization of their resources. What this meant exactly was left unclear as the natives already lacked private property and instead based ownership on family and clan. As such, the tribes happily agreed."
baltimare.30.a:0 "Peace in our time."
baltimare.31.t:0 "The Segregation Act"
baltimare.31.d:0 "The trade union militiaponies began their final offensive against Stars Whirl and her lunarist followers. The fighting in the jungles was fierce, but not as fierce as it could've been. For weeks now loudspeakers had been broadcasting messages which promised the thestrals amnesty and status as second-class citizens if they gave up and stopped fighting. With low morale, many bat ponies indeed did so, yet those that remained proved very determined to keep resisting. Only after their leader was shot by a sniper did they finally capitulate. Many lives had been lost in the vicious traps and night-time ambushes and raids of the thestrals, but their sacrifice would not be forgotten.\n\nNow SESR would keep its promise for the thestrals, and indeed granted them citizenship. But it was limited: Bat ponies were only allowed to live in designated ghettos in cities, could not join regular pony communes and had to establish their own and had services separated exclusively for them. They did get the right to vote, but not much more. Nevertheless, most thestrals thought this was better than being forced to fight for their lives in the merciless jungle."

baltimare.32.t:0 "The Indigenous Reservation System"
baltimare.32.d:0 "Today leaders of the native tribes of the south-east who had continued their violent resitance finally entered the negotiation table in Baltimare. Most of them were Neighua, as the Coltecs and Mareyans had mostly agreed to join rural communes. The chiefs agreed for talks only after generous promises made by Golden Delicious. The natives would be allowed to keep their lands and would not be forced to collectivize their property. They would be allowed to retain their own governments and laws as long as they did not conflict with the constitution of SESR. A formal peace treaty between the tribes -- now recognized as federal subjects -- and the central government was signed as well.\n\nHowever, the amount of land "granted" was anything but generous, and the tribes would still be encouraged or pressured to collectivize. Little aid would be given to those who refused, leaving them in their underdeveloped and backwards state, with a relatively high mortality rate."

It is clear the workers cooperated closely and had a shared plan, meaning labour unions were involved, legal or not. Our police also suspects there was foreign involvement, with all trails pointing to SESR, where the trade union organization TER is in control.\n\nThe question is, what do we do about the matter? The workers demand such drastic reforms that we will never be able to fulfill their every demand, but perhaps we can make some concessions."

Light Narrative agreed to found a socialist party representing thestrals and would talk to prominent resistance leaders such as Stars Whirl and convince them to stop fighting with promises of extensive rights. However, he demanded the assassination of Starry Glory, the most fanatical figurehead of the lunarists. If he wasn't removed out of the picture, peace would remain a fantasy.\n\nSoon after the meeting Cricket Chafer entrusted his trustworthy comrade, Lavender Berry, with carrying out the task. He was the right pony for the job, for less than a week later news arrived that Starry Glory had been shot and stabbed by an unknown assailant. Without a determined leader, the resistance faltered, and Light Narrative swooped in, telling stories of how good their lives would be in a socialist society. Almost everyone was convinced and soon enough the lunar resistance had ended."

It included a rural education reform, various development projects and so on, all aimed to modernize and integrate the numerous native tribes of the south-east. Opponents to this claimed it would endanger the culture and way of life of the natives, but Chairpony Cricket Chafer reminded the that the native way of life consisted of inequality, ignorance and poverty. Communism would be introduced to the natives and their lands collectivized, no matter what.\n\nCricket Chafer organized republican forces to protect a final, large-scale operation which was the most controversial part of the program: The mass deportation of natives from their homes in the jungle into more developed regions and cities. This understandably received a strong response from the natives, so use of force was necessary. Many were killed or wounded during the operation, but in the end hundreds of thousands of natives arrived in their new, modern homes. Eventually, they would embrace communism and be integrated into mainstream society, though it would no doubt take some time."

baltimare.39.t:0 "The Great Fire"
baltimare.39.d:0 "Dozens of planes previously used as training planes, transporting mail or in agriculture, were requisitioned by the State and repurposed at the Baltimare airport. Thousands of canisters of napalm, thermite and other incendiaries had been prepared in the chemical plants or acquired from abroad. The planes would use them to deal with the lunarist resistance once and for all.\n\nThe air fleet set out together during the day, when the thestral resistance fighters were asleep. They then unleashed their deadly payload and set the jungle below them on fire. Incendiary bombs were dropped on all identified and suspected bases of the resistance. In a great flash they ruptured, the screams of the dying drowned out by the wrathful burning of the flames.\n\nSuch strikes were made multiple times all across the peninsula. Its primary effect was psychological, and indeed many fighters soon surrendered after witnessing the fate of the victims of the fires. Hundreds or even thousands of hectares of jungle were burnt to cinders and civilian casualties could not be avoided. Lavender Berry decreed the ash-rich land be converted to swidden which could then be used by farmers for food production. Remains of charred thestrals would have to be cleared out first, of course."

baltimare.40.t:0 "The Screaming Jungles"
baltimare.40.d:0 "The army of the State prepared for a grim but necessary mission: Crushing the dissenting native resistance, nationalizing their lands and property and ensuring they would obey directives. To ensure the task would be accomplished, the soldiers were advised to be ruthless, and were fed copious amounts of propaganda depicting the natives as bloodthirsty savages who engage in cannibalism and live sacrifice of ponies.\n\nEach pocket of resistance and every native village was targeted with a warning bombardment of napalm or thermite. If they did not surrender and agree immediate integration into the State, the army would attack with flamethrowers and rifles and systematically hunt down the dissenters. Such a method was systematically used from region to region, with hundreds of villages being destroyed and hundreds more successfully forced to bend. Loyalty was ensured by taking hostages and disarming the locals.\n\nIn many places the natives fought back, either with stolen guns or self-made crude bows and spears. Casualties could not be avoided, but the natives were disorganized and outnumbered, and could do little against fire which consumed their dear jungles.\n\nThe death toll was great, but after the smoke cleared off, it was quiet. There was peace in the South-East at last."

baltimare.41.d:0 "One night, it began to echo everywhere in the jungle. The drums, ceaselessly beating at a slow and steady rhythm. It did not take long for patrols to be mobilized to find the source of this unauthorized noise which required a permit from the Ministry of Music. But as they approached the source of the sounds, they disappeared only to reappear further away. Soon enough the patrols gave up.\n\nThen the drums beat more frantically. Each day, the peace quickened. The sounds got louder and more numerous. Yet the drummers remained hidden and reclusive. The troops became increasingly nervous.\n\nThen they started vanishing one by one.\n\nSoon enough the soldiers deserted their posts as their comrades went missing on patrols and during the night. Yet Comrade Berry was not pleased and ordered the deserters to be shot on sight, and sent more and more troops into the jungles. He began to once again prepare his napalm bombers to deal with this nuisance swiftly.\n\nReports arrived of sabotaged planes and looted armouries. Explosions echoed near Baltimare as the storages filled with thermite and napalm exploded without a clear reason. Little did Berry know that this was only the beginning.\n\nThe next day the war began. Hordes of enraged natives, ponies and thestrals covered in blood of sacrificed soldiers, swept aside small pockets of resistance. Before the army could be mobilized, half of the peninsula was now in control of the savages. Their leader finally revealed themselves. Ahuizotl, the Son of the Sun and Moon, the Promised One.

BAL_gay_brandon_desc:0 "An ethnic Coltjun born in one of the numerous towns and villages of the Hayseed Swamps, the hardened Boreal Bloom has been many things, from being a pegasus scout during the troubled times of the December Revolution to being a chief mechanic working within the mid-level management of Baltimare's largest motor plant as well as a regular writer for the local socialist newspaper, publishing columns and distributing pamphlets calling for the achievement, defence and spreading of the socialist doctrine by a strong and orderly, yet fair and patriotic state right before the city erupted into revolution.\n\nAs Baltimare descended into chaos during the Lunar occupation, Boreal Bloom and his fellow coworkers overthrew and imprisoned the upper management of the factory complex before coalescing numerous surrounding revolutionary uprisings within the industrial park into a single unified column of worker-soldiers and, to the surprise of the other revolutionary forces, boldly breaking out from a Baltimare still surrounded by Lunar forces at the helm of a flying column to assist the liberation of his native Hayseed Swamps and driving out the thestrals from them altogether in tandem with the local Coltjun militias.\n\nDespite his supposed sympathies for the statist PON and IU organizations and his open antagonism towards the CAN, his pragmatic appreciation of many of TER's ideals has led him to voluntarily place himself and his force under the nominal command of Comrade Golden Delicious, determined to not let the Revolution die at all costs."

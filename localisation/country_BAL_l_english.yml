BAL_government:0 "Stronghold of the Revolution"
BAL_government_desc:0 "Unfortunately the glorious Equestrian revolution that the PCP and Comrade Glimmer promised did not come to pass... due to unforeseen circumstances, leaving us stranded in the Equestrian Southeast.

Thankfully we have plenty of iron and coal just waiting to be used waiting for us in the jungle that we can use to expand our steelworks"
BAL_plantation:0 "Seringueira Plantations"
BAL_plantation_desc:0 "The Seringueira, or, more commonly known, as a rubber tree or rubber plant, is a tree belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is the most economically important member of the genus Hevea because the milky latex extracted from the tree is the primary source of natural rubber and the jungles to our south are filled with them, we should exploit this fact."
BAL_collective_plantations:0 "Collectivize the Seringueira Plantations"
BAL_collective_plantations_desc:0 "While the Seringueira plantations have proven useful in both creating jobs for the people and providing our nation with valuable rubber, they're simply not efficient enough and thus should be collectivized. However chances are not everyone will be happy with having to work on a plantation in the middle of a hellish jungle."

BAL_arms_2_desc:0 "The Baltimare Arsenal has always been renowned for making quality guns for all Equestrian's nobles to use, however with the revolution we simply cannot allow them to continue peddling guns to possible enemies, and as such we should nationalize their production lines... however some ponies might not like this decision."

BAL_farming:0 "Subsidize Agriculture"
BAL_farming_desc:0 "The first step to improving both our economy and our industry, is making sure we have enough food to feed our people.

During peacetime they were rather well known for producing hunting guns for the Canterlot nobility, but to everypony's shock they decided to side with the Baltimare Workers when our Revolution kicked off.

Whilst grade school level education was both free and mandatory for all Equestrians, high school and university is not.

baltimare.1.t:0 "Flags at Half Mast"
 baltimare.1.d:0 "A great tragedy has struck our young Republic today, as Comrade Delicious reportedly suffered a severe heart attack while resting in his own home. Doctors were called to attempt to save his life, but it was to no avail as he passed away shortly after being carted away to the local hospital. With Comrade Delicious dead, we face a whole new problem: the lack of an official leader. in the end the Baltimare's Worker Council has agreed to vote between two high-ranking councilmembers: Diamond Chafer and Larry Berry. While Comrade Berry has vowed to defend the principals of the Republic many are still skeptical of him due to his role in organizing the BMS and his ties with the leadership of Stalliongrad in the north particularly the hard liners such as Comrade Vasily. Comrade Chafer on the other hoof advocates a slightly more liberal approach to both politics and economics thus putting him at odds with both Stalliongrad and the hard line communists at home. He aims to forge closer ties to Equestria and ensure the continued existance of our fledgeling republic as a sovereign state. Whoever we choose we must choose quickly, there is a war to be won after all."
 baltimare.1.a:0 "Comrade Chafter shall lead us to victory"
 baltimare.1.b:0 "The fate of the Republic falls into Comrade Berry's hooves"
 baltimare.2.t:0 "Larry Berry's Proposal"
 baltimare.2.d:0 "In light of the recent attempted assassination of Comrade Delicious, Larry Berry the People's Commissar of Interior has recently arrived to us with an interesting proposal. He has spent weeks building support amongst his fellow councilmembers for the establishment of an agency that would have extra-judical authority to detain and or "dispose" of anypony deemed an enemy of the state. Comrade Berry has argued that while this would decrease the civil liberties of our citizens it would also ensure the safety of our Republic and allow us to focus on fighting our enemies on the battlefield rather than having to worry about sabouters and traitor."
 baltimare.2.a:0 "Give him the green light"
 baltimare.2.b:0 "We will not sacrifice our freedom for safety!"
 baltimare.3.t:0 "Chaos in Baltimare"
 baltimare.3.d:0 "Chaos once more descended upon the city of Baltimare, as shortly after the proclimation of the Mare Republic an assassin snuck into the city and attempted to shoot Comrade Delicious. Despite being armed with both a high caliber rifle and several explosives, the attempt was foiled when the assassin acidentally shot themselves in the hoof and proceeded to fall off the building they had been perched on, nearly crushing Comrade Delicious in the process. Needless to say the assassination attempt was a spectacular failure. However the attempt did show that we have enemies not just across the border, but amongst us as well."
 baltimare.3.a:0 "Back to business then."
 baltimare.4.t:0 "To the Victor the Spoils"
 baltimare.4.d:0 "After all the hardships we've faced, we've managed to emerge as the clear victors in the Southern War. With the South now officially under our flag the Baltimare's Worker Council has decided to rebrand themselves into the Southern Equestrian Worker's Council and proclaim the creation of the South Equestrian Socialist Republic."
 baltimare.4.a:0 "Long live the Republic!"
 baltimare.5.t:0 "Missing Ponies"
 baltimare.5.d:0 "Ever since we allowed Berry to organize the BMS more and more ponies have started disappearing, and while we've managed to hide or cover up most of these "dissapearences" some citizens have started theorising that their friends and family are in fact not having a vacation in Zebrica."
 baltimare.5.a:0 "It's all for the greater good..."
 baltimare.6.t:0 "Another Assassination Attempt"
 baltimare.6.d:0 "As our glorious leader Comrade Delicious was touring the front lines earlier today in an effort to raise the morale of our brave troops, the unexpected happened as yet another assassin attempted to put an abrupt end to his rule. The assassin themselves decided to attempt to kill our glorious leader with a gift basket filled with poisioned muffins, candies, several needles and an angry wasp nest. Trough some miracle the assassin managed to sneak the basket near Delicious' tent but was stopped at the last moment by his personal guards, who promptly took it as a bribe. Needless to say Comrade Delicious will require new bodyguards, but has otherwise not been harmed. Unfortunately though the assassin was not caught."
 baltimare.6.a:0 "An angry wasp nest you say?"
 baltimare.7.t:0 "Yet Another Attempt"
 baltimare.7.d:0 "It has become increasingly obvious that somepony does not exactly have the highest opinion of Comrade Delicious, seeing as once more an attempt was made on his life. In this particular instance the assassin decided to go for something far more practical; a plastic explosive. The explosive itself was timed so that it would explode at right about the usual time Comrade Delicious arrived at his office, unfortunately for the assassin our glorious leader was slightly late due to being busy at home... doing things... private things. While Comrade Delicious managed to escape the explosion unharmed this most recent attempt has more or less confirmed that someone within the government wants our leader dead."
 baltimare.7.a:0 "This demands investigation!"
 baltimare.8.t:0 "The Grand Investigation"
 baltimare.8.d:0 "With the most recent attempt on Comrade Delicious' life the Baltimare's Worker Council has come to the conclusion that somepony within the government is either a traitor or working closely with the Mare Republic's enemies. Either way the Council has decided to start a grand investigation to find the head of the snake."
 baltimare.8.a:0 "Let's hope we can figure this out quickly."
 baltimare.9.t:0 "Stolen Evidence"
 baltimare.9.d:0 "It seems that our little traitor has been busy as several files and leads have been found missing from the Worker's Council's offices. While this won't do too much to slow down the investigation it will put our government's effectivness into question seeing as the traitor literally just walked in and stole evidence."
 baltimare.9.a:0 "Seems the rat is scared..."
 baltimare.10.t:0 "Murdered Suspect"
 baltimare.10.d:0 "It seems that the rat has struck again seeing as one of the suspects that we've recently taken into custody was found dead in their cells last night. While this will do little to slow down the investigation it still reflects poorly upon our government's capabilities to roout out traitors."
 baltimare.10.a:0 "They can't hide forever..."
 baltimare.11.t:0 "A Massive Lead"
 baltimare.11.d:0 "After months of investigation and following dozens of dead ends we've finally managed to catch a break. A former member of the cleaning staff in the Council's offices came forth and described a rather odd encounter on the day he was fired. Apparently after finishing his work for the day he ran into a rather odd blue mare whom according to him he had never seen in his life before that moment. She Introduced herself to him as "Raven Flight" and claimed to be a new member of the cleaning staff and that she had been specifically assigned to Comrade Delicious' office and promptly asked for directions to the office, not thinking much of it our witness promptly directed her to the office and never saw her again. While some members of our Government dismissed this as a jealous ex-employee trying to get some revenge on his former co-workers, further investigation into our employment records did in fact confirm that no one named Raven Flight has ever worked in the Council's offices."
 baltimare.11.a:0 "We must find this "Raven Flight""
 baltimare.12.t:0 "The Lead"
 baltimare.12.d:0 "After weeks of searching the police in cooperation with the BMS and several concerned citizens has finally managed to find our suspect... unfortunately the encounter wasn't exactly what we expected. We did in fact manage to track down this Raven Flight, however it seems that our traitor found her first... When the police entered the small house right outside of Baltimare where our suspect had been living for the last couple of months they found a scene straight out of a horror movie. The suspect was found to have been cut with a meat cleaver some odd thirty to sixty times resulting in an extremely painful death, in addition to that the entire house was ransacked suggesting that the traitor or their agent were in fact looking for something. While our prospects of finding anything were slim trough some miracle the police managed to find quite a large amount of encoded messages hidden beneath one of the floor boards. While it will take us some time to decode the messages this will take us much closer to finding the traitor."
 baltimare.12.a:0 "It seems they should have hidden their trail better."
 baltimare.13.t:0 "A Conspiracy"
 baltimare.13.d:0 "Despite the evidence we most recently gathered being locked up in the depths of the main council chamber, it seems that some of it has gone missing which has confirmed our worst fears; that somepony on the council is the perpetrator... however this does mean that our list of suspects has been shortened to about twenty ponies so there is a bright side to these developments."
 baltimare.13.a:0 "Unbelievable!"
 baltimare.14.t:0 "The Traitor"
 baltimare.14.d:0 "After months of decoding the evidence we've finally managed to discern the identity of the traitor, and it seems that it was non other than Larry Berry... our Minister of Interior... needless to say the council was shocked by this revelation. However they are now more determined to arrest the traitor than ever and have sent Comrade Chafer to "collect" our dear friend Berry."
 baltimare.14.a:0 "Comrade Chafer will take care of that weasel!"
 baltimare.15.t:0 "The Finale"
 baltimare.15.d:0 "It seems that our now former Minister of Interior decided to take the cowards way out. When Comrade Chafer finally managed to breach his way into the BMS Headquarters and after facing armed ressistance he found Larry Berry dead in his office with a gun in his mouth, the evidence recovered from his office is enough to condemn his entire organization for high treason. However with Berry's death and the deaths of his supporters perhaps we should consider reforming the BMS so that such an accident does not happen ever again."
 baltimare.15.a:0 "Enough of this insanity, Disolve the BMS!"
 baltimare.15.b:0 "Reform them into something more useful."
 baltimare.15.c:0 "The traitor is dead, leave them be."
 baltimare.16.t:0 "Dealing With the Tribals."
 baltimare.16.d:0 "During the chaos in the South the Dr Caballeron a well known explorer and mercenary created a rogue state in the middle of the deep South. Now that Nightmare Moon's supporters have been dealt with perhaps we should deal with him?"
 baltimare.16.a:0 "We'll just kick him out of the jungle."
 baltimare.16.c:0 "Let us try to make a deal with him."
 baltimare.16.b:0 "He's not worth our time"
 baltimare.17.t:0 "Dealing With the Celestial State"
 baltimare.17.d:0 "During the chaos in the South the Celestial State formed out of those ponies who wished to rejoin Equestria after Nightmare Moon declared her revolt. With our mutual enemy in the South now gone perhaps we should deal with them?"
 baltimare.17.a:0 "We'll send them packing back to Canterlot!"
 baltimare.17.c:0 "Surely they would want to be a part of our glorious union."
 baltimare.17.b:0 "No point in even bothering with them."
 baltimare.18.t:0 "Dr Caballeron Reject Our Offer"
 baltimare.18.d:0 "Dr Caballeron has rejected our offer. What shall we do?"
 baltimare.18.a:0 "Time to do this the hard way..."

### FOCUS LOCALISATION ####################
###########################################
BAL_revolution:0 "Form The Baltimare Congress"
BAL_revolution_desc:0 "If we wish to prevail in this conflict, we must stand united in purpose. To this end, we must establish a democratic government to replace the old one. Proper elections will have to wait for peace, so for now every party and union will get equal representation."
BAL_anarchists_in_government:0 "Anarchists In The Government"
BAL_anarchists_in_government_desc:0 "Though the anarchists of CAN have so far been hesitant about joining the congress, they have now mostly come to an agreement that cooperation with a statist entity is necessary. With representation in the Congress, they can oppose any proposals from PON or IU that infringe too much on their liberty."
BAL_advisors_from_stg:0 "Advisors From Stalliongrad"
BAL_advisors_from_stg_desc:0 "Our comrades in Stalliongrad have had years of experience from both struggle against the bourgeoisie as well as running a communist country. We would be foolish to not ask for their help. Their sharpest minds and most cunning commanders will be a great boon to our war effort... That is, if they agree to send them here."
BAL_workers_self_management:0 "Workers' Self-Management"
BAL_workers_self_management_desc:0 "The means of production belong to the workers, so the workers themselves must be allowed to manage their businesses freely with minimal interference. With increased autonomy in daily labour, morale will be boosted and exploitation by bosses and managers will be eliminated competely."
BAL_nationalization:0 "Nationalization"
BAL_nationalization_desc:0 "The path to communism is not an easy one, and the recent economic chaos has proven that intervention by a central authority is necessary as a temporary measure, especially during conflict. As our government is a democratic and proletarian one, workers' control of the state-owned means of production is still possible."
BAL_mayors_fate:0 "Deciding The Mayor's Fate"
BAL_mayors_fate_desc:0 "The former mayor of Baltimare, Ash Moustache, proved to be no better than the despotic mare who set her police-hounds upon us during the general strike of 995. He openly welcomed the imperialist thestrals and happily cooperated with their short-lived tyrannical regime. Yet some among us speak of friendship and forgiveness. The Congress must convene to decide his fate."
BAL_loot_royal_armouries:0 "Loot Royal Armouries"
BAL_loot_royal_armouries_desc:0 "The small garrison of the Equestrian army in Baltimare was apprehended by the lunarists when they occupied the city, but their equipment was left alone in their armouries. What are we waiting for? Let's crack them open and empty them and take what we need. We don't want the guns to end up in the filthy hooves of monarchists or lunarists, after all."
BAL_form_industrial_committees:0 "Form Industrial Committees"
BAL_form_industrial_committees_desc:0 "So far there has been a complete lack of planning and cooperation in our newly established socialist economy. We must rectify this by establishing democratic workers' committees in our production facilities and farms, which will then make decentralized economic plans together and execute them in collaboration with each other."
BAL_meadowbrooks_aid:0 "Mage Meadowbrook's Aid"
BAL_meadowbrooks_aid_desc:0 "In the Hayseed Swamps, one of the ancient Pillars of Equestria lives. She is known as Meadowbrook and her skills at healing are already famous in the region. While she has shown no interest in our revolutionary cause and might harbour monarchist sympathies, she is more than willing to heal our wounded and sick militiaponies, which helps their morale as well."
BAL_weapons_from_stalliongrad:0 "Weapons From Stalliongrad"
BAL_weapons_from_stalliongrad_desc:0 "Our comrades in the cold north have a thriving industry and vast stockpiles of armaments. Surely they will happily supply us with anything we ask for? This way we will leave the Equestrian armouries alone and avoid angering them or their supporters. Of course, we must first decide what exactly we want from Stalliongrad."
BAL_supreme_economic_council:0 "Establish The Supreme Economic Council"
BAL_supreme_economic_council_desc:0 "The Congress has decreed that a single council shall be established that will be responsible for formulating a single state-wide economic plan for the duration of the war. They will also supervise that all institutions below them will closely follow their plans for production, distribution and allocation. Divergence from this plan will not be tolerated."
BAL_armed_unions:0 "Armed Trade Unions"
BAL_armed_unions_desc:0 "Our labour unions have already taken up arms and formed their own militias. Now Comrade Delicious proposes we enshrine their right to bear arms in law, further integrating the common workers into our military. Members of trade unions are eager to serve and defend their homes from reactionary aggression, though their skill is questionable at best."
BAL_revolutionary_discipline:0 "Revolutionary Discipline"
BAL_revolutionary_discipline_desc:0 "It is useless to simply order a soldier to fight. One must explain to them why they must fight and why it is important to keep doing so. Then they will take up arms willingly instead of being forced to do it, and won't run away at the first sight of danger."
BAL_consolidate_production:0 "Consolidate Production"
BAL_consolidate_production_desc:0 "It is becoming clear to us that small businesses are lacking in efficiency compared to larger ones. We must shut down the shops of the petit bourgeoisie and establish larger syndicates of production, capable of employing more workers and being easier to manage by our committees."
BAL_anti_monarchism:0 "Anti-Monarchist Rally"
BAL_anti_monarchism_desc:0 "Equestrian ponies have traditionally always looked up to Princess Celestia and other alicorns as some godlike beings who can do no wrong. The violent repression of the Winter Revolution proved otherwise, as has the recent civil war. Yet some still delude themselves. We must reveal the truth of these despicable monarchs to all, and hopefully turn them to our side."
BAL_create_mis:0 "Create The MIS"
BAL_create_mis_desc:0 "Lavender Berry, leader of the IU, has proposed we establish a secret service comprised of his party members. They will investigate suspected traitors to the revolution and apprehend enemy spies, as well as decrypt the communications of our foes. Lavender is eager to make use of his talents as the head of such an organisation."
BAL_military_commissars:0 "Military Commissars"
BAL_military_commissars_desc:0 "To maintain high morale within our militia and to better endoctrinate them to our revolutionary cause, we need political commissars attached to every military unit. Not only will they act as inspiring leaders, but will also manage supplies and maintain strict war-time rationing among our ranks."
BAL_protect_middle_class:0 "Protect The Middle Class"
BAL_protect_middle_class_desc:0 "The anarcho-syndicalists are eager to collectivize the property of smallholders and traders, thinking that they are enemies of the revolution. They are mistaken. It is the bourgeoisie, the imperialists and the monarchists who stand against us. We do not want to antagonize the moderates; Instead, let us befriend them and gain a powerful ally."
BAL_delicious_column:0 "Form The Delicious Column"
BAL_delicious_column_desc:0 "As Golden Delicious marches across the countryside, more and more ponies flock to his red banner, eager to participate in the revolution. More foreigners arrive from abroad too, eager to help our cause. We should welcome them openly and give them supplies so they can participate in the fighting and bring the revolution to our enemies."
BAL_abolish_bit:0 "Abolish The Bit"
BAL_abolish_bit_desc:0 "Money has no place in the socialist society we are creating as the war rages on. Distribution shall solely be based on need instead of personal wealth. We will repurpose native temples into communal warehouses and allow the people to take what they need from them. If shortages appear, rationing will take place so everyone gets their fair share."
BAL_red_terror:0 "Red Terror"
BAL_red_terror_desc:0 "The anti-monarchist rally has galvanized us. Let us now release this fury kindling in our hearts and aim it at the enemies among us, the bankers, the industrialists, the imperialists, the monarchists, the priests and the landowners. All who threaten the revolution of the proletariat, all who have oppressed us for decades and centuries, all must bleed."
BAL_state_capitalism:0 "State Capitalism"
BAL_state_capitalism_desc:0 "In these dire times, it is necessary for the state to run the economy. It is a patient step on the road to socialism, and combines capitalism with state control and ownership, thus preventing exploitation by bourgeoisie which occurs in unlimited, normal capitalism."
BAL_regular_army:0 "Establish A Regular Army"
BAL_regular_army_desc:0 "This war will not be won by bands of unorganized, undisciplined militiaponies. We must establish a proper, hierarchically organized and centrally commanded army. Only then do we stand a chance against the reactionary hordes threatening our revolution."
BAL_devolve_government:0 "Devolve Government"
BAL_devolve_government_desc:0 "While so far the Congress has been capable of making relatively wise decisions, the influence of the statists is too great and hinders our plans for a true socialist utopia. To remove these centrists, reformists and traitors to the revolution out of the picture, we must weaken the Congress and empower local, grassroots institutions."
BAL_arrest_anarchists:0 "Arrest Anarchists"
BAL_arrest_anarchists_desc:0 "Stalliongrad keeps threatening to withdraw support if we do not do something about the radical mobs endangering the integrity of our newborn communist state. We cannot allow them to roam around with their own armed patrols, illegally collectivizing what they want and disregarding the decisions of the Congress. Law and order must be restored by any means necessary."
BAL_to_the_barricades:0 "To The Barricades!"
BAL_to_the_barricades_desc:0 "Now that we are secure from within, we must secure ourselves from without. Reactionaries wishing to destroy our revolution must be crushed. The workers must be rallied to defend their communal homes from the enemy who wishes to take everything away from us and reduce us back into slavery. Long live the revolution! They shall not pass!"

BAL_proclaim_sesr:0 "Proclaim The SESR"
BAL_proclaim_sesr_desc:0 "Now that we have defeated the opposition to our revolution, it is time to integrate the lands which were previously under reactionary occupation. All proletariat are welcome to join our newborn South-Eastern Socialist Republic and embrace its socialist ideals. Workers of the south-east, unite!"
BAL_elections:0 "Hold Elections"
BAL_elections_desc:0 "The foundations for our republic are in place. Soon it will be time for the provisional government to step down and for new leaders, elected democratically, to take their place. Of course, reactionary parties will not be allowed to participate, but all adult proletariat are free to do so."

### IDEAS ##################################
###########################################
BAL_economic_chaos:0 "Economic Chaos"
BAL_economic_chaos_desc:0 "Following the beginning of the civil war, occupation by lunarists and the recent revolution, the economy of Baltimare is in tatters. Trade links which kept the city's industry alive have been severed and the country is surrounded on all sides by hostiles. Things are not made better by the fact that socialists and anarchists have forcefully nationalized or collectivized farms and factories without establishing proper management for them."
BAL_economic_chaos2:0 "Economic Chaos"
BAL_economic_chaos2_desc:0 "Thanks to hasty economic reforms, some semblance of order has been introduced to the economy and production rates have increased. But many issues remain which hurt the efficiency of most facilities."
BAL_economic_chaos3:0 "Economic Chaos"
BAL_economic_chaos3_desc:0 "Further reforms and policy changes have completely restructured the economy, which has helped with both production and distribution. Foreign aid has been received as well and put to use. However, more work remains to be done before Baltimare's economy has fully recovered."
BAL_military_disarray:0 "Military Disarray"
BAL_military_disarray_desc:0 "The "army" of Baltimare, if you can call it that, consists entirely of worker militias who have no formal military training and a small amount of experience they got from driving out the lunarist occupiers. Their equipment and officers are both lacking and, worst of all, there is no unified command structure, with most units acting independently with no coordination."
BAL_military_disarray2:0 "Military Disarray"
BAL_military_disarray2_desc:0 "Several reforms have been implemented, which introduce some much needed order into the army. There are more officers, better equipment and more coordination among the ranks, and a rough command structure is being established."
BAL_military_disarray3:0 "Military Disarray"
BAL_military_disarray3_desc:0 "The army is in a much better shape, which capable officers spread evenly among the ranks in a well-planned command structure. Training regimens and experience on the field have both make the common soldiers better at doing their job. Not much more is needed for Baltimare to have a proper and organized modern army."
BAL_self_managed_factories:0 "Workers' Self-Management"
BAL_self_managed_factories_desc:0 "Factories and farms are being collectivized, with the former capitalists and managers being removed out of the picture. Control over production is exercised by democratic (and admittedly inefficient) assemblies of the workers themselves, and their surplus production benefits us as a whole instead of going into the deep, ravenous pockets of overseers."
BAL_nationalization_idea:0 "Nationalization"
BAL_nationalization_idea_desc:0 "The Congress has passed legislation which makes it the de jure owner of all property and means of production, making it legal to seize them from their unlawful owners who are often greedy capitalists. The state-owned businesses are then given for the workers to control via a democratic process, with some restrictions."
BAL_meadowbrooks_aid_idea:0 "Mage Meadowbrook's Aid"
BAL_meadowbrooks_aid_idea_desc:0 "Mage Meadowbrook of the Hayseed Swamps, one of the six Pillars of Equestria, has volunteered to heal our ailing soldiers."
BAL_whydoesntthisshitworkdammit:0 "Armed Trade Unions"
BAL_armed_unions_idea_desc:0 "The common worker is allowed by law to take up arms to defend themselves against imperialists and reactionaries."
BAL_revolutionary_discipline_idea:0 "Revolutionary Discipline"
BAL_revolutionary_discipline_idea_desc:0 "Discipline is not something that comes when you beat up a soldier, it comes when they understand what they are fighting for and why."
BAL_mis:0 "MIS - Military Investigation Service"
BAL_mis_desc:0 "The survival of the revolution must be ensured, no matter the cost."
BAL_military_commissars_idea:0 "Military Commissars"
BAL_military_commissars_idea_desc:0 "Discipline and loyalty to the revolution will be maintained by any means necessary."
BAL_bit_abolished:0 "Bit Abolished"
BAL_bit_abolished_desc:0 "Some would call you crazy if you decided to simply take all the money and burn it. However, that is exactly what socialists of Baltimare have done."
BAL_state_capitalism_idea:0 "State Capitalism"
BAL_state_capitalism_idea_desc:0 "Markets and money exist, but without despicable bourgeoisie. Instead, the state has full control over both."
BAL_to_the_barricades_idea:0 "They Shall Not Pass!"
BAL_to_the_barricades_idea_desc:0 "Long live the revolution! Death to reactionaries!"

He has lived in Baltimare his entire life, working in its docks as a hauler. Poor working conditions inspired him to join a labour union and he soon became active in politics, advocating for better rights for Equestria's working class. In recent years he has been part of Stalliongrad's secret military training program and has proven his skills as a capable, inspiring leader."

### EVENTS #################################
###########################################

baltimare.1.t:0 "The Spark of Revolution"
baltimare.1.d:0 "As the Baltimare Radio broadcasted sounds of chaos in Canterlot, the thestrals living in the outskirts of the city began rioting. When a battalion of armed bat ponies appeared from the jungle, carrying a black banner of the moon, the rioters and Mayor Ash Moustache welcomed them. He was a good friend of the mayor of Manehattan and was sympathetic to the plight of the thestrals./n/nThe lunarists soon realized they were in a city that was openly hostile to them./n/nBaltimare had been a center of the labour union movement for decades and was the headquarters of the nation-wide workers’ organization CAN-TER. The unions of factory workers, dockworkers and sailors of the city had always pushed for better pay and fairer working conditions, which the mayor had been reluctant to grant in fear of losing profits. When the ponies of Stalliongrad rose up in arms, a general strike took place in Baltimare as a sign of support. The mayor responded by sending in the police to violently suppress it. Though Princess Celestia removed her from office afterwards and Mayor Ash Moustache replaced her after elections, the damage had been done: many workers could no longer trust the government and were pushed to radicalism. Stalliongrad was happy to support them as secret stashes of weapons were gathered in preparation for revolution./n/nNow that distrusted bat ponies tried to take over the city and impose strict war-time curfews and poor working conditions on the workers, they realized the time for revolution had come. Militias were formed and stockpiled weapons were put to use. The thestrals were driven out and the Mayor imprisoned, his government dissolved. The militia drove onwards, liberating the forests around Baltimare, before they had to stop./n/nThe military was now in complete disarray and so was the economy. Different unions and parties had their own militias that did not cooperate and had a complete lack of discipline, some workers collectivized factories and farms while others nationalized them. Capitalism was crushed as soon as possible, with no regard to what chaos it would cause. Now that the lunarists were gathering their forces on the frontline, it was clear something had to be done to prevent the revolution from collapsing into itself."
baltimare.1.a:0 "We must stand united against reactionaries!"
baltimare.2.t:0 "The First Session of the Congress"
baltimare.2.d:0 "The old town hall, once the home of Mayor Ash Moustache, was now filled to the brim with representatives of the numerous revolutionary factions within Baltimare. Together they formed the Popular Front, a political coalition and the only legal party within Baltimare, at least for now. The Congress was meant to be a temporary war-time government and thus monarchists and republicans were not allowed to be in it as they were suspected of being supporters of the Celestial State or Ash Moustache.\n\nOut of the myriad parties and organizations in the Popular Front, the most notable ones were the anarcho-syndicalist CAN-TER, communist PON and stallionist IU. CAN was an organization of anarchist militants closely affiliated with TER, but have so far been very reluctant about participating in the statist Congress. TER was a country-wide confederation of labour unions whose headquarters were in Baltimare. PON was a communist party supported by Stalliongrad and lead by Cricket Chafer, a veteran of the Winter Revolution, while IU was a fringe party of stallionists who believed a powerful state was needed to make true communism possible. Its leader Lavender Berry was a shady figure and a former policepony, who had defected, betrayed his fellow officers and revealed his secret membership in IU.\n\nDuring the first session, Golden Delicious of TER, who lead the offensive which drove the reactionary thestrals out of Baltimare, has been elected to be the provisional chairpony of the Congress. In addition a draft of a new constitution for the Republic was made and several social reforms were passed."
baltimare.2.a:0 "We're off to a good start."
baltimare.3.t:0 "Revolution In Baltimare"
baltimare.3.d:0 "Recently news of revolution in south-eastern part of war-embroiled Equestria arrived in Sicameon. The formation of a socialist republic in Baltimare pleased the radicals and the syndicalists, for the city was the headquarters of Equestria's largest confederation of labour unions, CAN-TER. Some were so enthusiastic of this that they were eager to travel abroad and aid their equine comrades in their struggle. Among them is the writer Jorge Orellana, former teacher known for his left-leaning novels. He said that he desired to go fight against the monarchist supporters who opposed the young republic, and was confident in his own combat abilities."
baltimare.3.a:0 "Let us hope they all return in one piece."
baltimare.4.t:0 "Support From Sicameon"
baltimare.4.d:0 "Having heard of our revolution, syndicalists and radicals from the Federated Parishes of Sicameon have now arrived across the sea to support us in our struggle for freedom against monarchist oppressors. Among them is the writer Jorge Orellana, who was eager to fight. He has received training in the Sicameonese militia and Comrade Delicious has proposed promoting him, because we have a severe lack of capable officers."
baltimare.4.a:0 "Welcome, comrades!"
baltimare.5.t:0 "A Request From Baltimare"
baltimare.5.d:0 "Cricket Chafer, the leader of the communist POU party in Baltimare, has send us a secret telegram asking for our aid. He says their revolutionary struggle could benefit greatly from us sending our finest minds to act as advisors. While there, they could also work to sideline the counter-revolutionary anarchists and syndicalists in the Baltimare Congress.\n\nHowever, he did not specify what kind of advisors to send, so it is up to the politburo to decide. Should we send political or military advisors, or should we send anyone at all? Baltimare is a dangerous war zone, after all."
baltimare.5.a:0 "We shall send Gold Muffin and Spike Spiegel."
baltimare.5.b:0 "We shall send Sofia and Nevsky."
baltimare.5.c:0 "It is too risky. Send them thoughts and prayers."
baltimare.6.t_accepted:0 "Stalliongrad Sends Advisors"
baltimare.6.t_refused:0 "Stalliongrad Refused Our Request"
baltimare.6.d_gold_spike:0 "Good news! Escorted by several ships of the Red Navy, two advisors have arrived from Stalliongrad in the harbour of Baltimare: Gold Muffin, a communist changeling who is a refugee from Chrysalis' Queendom and a popular figure among the socialists of Equestria, as well as Spike Spiegel, one of the ponies responsible for the economic planning of Stalliongrad's military production. They have expressed their eagerness to aid us in our struggle."
baltimare.6.d_sofia_nevsky:0 "Good news! Escorted by several ships of the Red Navy, two advisors have arrived from Stalliongrad in the harbour of Baltimare: Sofia, a high-ranking veteran of the Winter Revolution and an expert on mobile warfare, and Nevsky, an officer known for his skillful management of logistics. They have expressed their eagerness to aid us in our struggle."
baltimare.6.d_refused:0 "Unfortunately, a telegram from Stalliongrad has been received that states they do not wish to send their advisors to an active warzone. They did say that other avenues for cooperation remained open and would be happy to send advisors after the end of hostilities, but already this has made it harder to trust our supposed comrades up north."
baltimare.6.a:0 "Their help is appreciated."
baltimare.6.b:0 "Their help is appreciated."
baltimare.6.c:0 "Our "comrades" have left us on our own..."
baltimare.7.t:0 "The Second Session of the Congress"
baltimare.7.d:0 "The Congress has once again gathered in the town hall of Baltimare, and has this time allowed its former occupant Ash Moustache to enter. He will hear what his fate will be, once the Congress comes to an agreement.\n\nAfter an hour of heated debate, three proposals proved to be most popular: Pardoning the mayor in the name of harmony, for he could not have known that the lunarist occupiers would be so harsh and simply wished to help the discriminated thestral minority. Some even said Baltimare Republic could benefit from his aid, for he is a well-behaved gentlecolt with diplomatic talent.\n\nAnother, seemingly the most popular proposal was punishing the mayor by humiliating and banishing him. This would not only discredit the old regime, but also remove a potential collaborator from the country. Those who opposed this idea, mostly anarchists and members of IU, feared that he would simply flee to the Celestial supporters and form a government in exile, and instead supported a most severe punishment: Death by firing squad."
baltimare.7.a:0 "Forgive and forget."
baltimare.7.b:0 "Humiliating him sounds fun!"
baltimare.7.c:0 "Shoot the bastard!"
baltimare.8.t:0 "The Mayor of Baltimare Arrives"
baltimare.8.d:0 "The deposed mayor of Baltimare, Ash Moustache, has recently arrived in Portland on a ship. He tells us that he was banished from his home city after a trial before the illegitimate socialist Congress. When our ponies questioned why he had no clothes, was completely shaved like a sheep and was covered in rotten eggs, he blushed and was reluctant to say what happened. Apparently he had been punished for collaborating with lunarists with public humiliation.´\n\nHe is now on his way to Stableside, and has assured us he has been disillusioned with the supporters of Nightmare Moon after their occupation turned out to be more ruthless than he had expected. He was more than happy to come to our aid, as long as we provide him with new clothes. With the mayor now safely in our control, [Root.GetLeader] can ask him to form a government-in-exile for the city of Baltimare."
baltimare.8.a:0 "We'll save Baltimare soon, don't worry."
baltimare.9.t:0 "Baltimare Executes Their Mayor"
baltimare.9.d:0 "News have arrived that the radical socialist revolutionaries of the Baltimare Republic have publicly executed their deposed mayor Ash Moustache. They at least had the mercy to do it with a firing squad. The mayor had been accused of collaborating with the lunarist occupiers and was deemed guilty, but this punishment seems rather severe, especially considering Ash Moustache was known to be a compassionate gentlecolt who simply wished to aid the discriminated thestral minority in Baltimare.\n\nThe Baltimare Republic has revealed its true face as a cold-blooded killer who will not hesitate to eliminate those they see as a threat. They have clearly completely abandoned harmony and friendship, so we should not even attempt to negotiate with them."
baltimare.9.a:0 "They will pay for what they've done..."
baltimare.10.t:0 "Preparing A Request"
baltimare.10.d:0 "The Congress has gathered once again in Baltimare's city hall to decide what kind of military equipment we should request from our comrades. Golden Delicious says many ponies in the trade unions are eager to fight, but unable to do so because of a lack of rifles, helmets and other infantry equipment. Cricket Chafer on the other hoof said that they had enough rifles and such for now, and should request more expensive artillery guns, which we have a dire lack of. With them, we can level the jungles and blast the bats from afar. Lavender Berry then made a more unusual proposal, saying we should ask for fighter planes. With control of the sky, we could dominate the battlefield and mow down our helpless, fleeing foes from above with impunity."
baltimare.10.a:0 "We need equipment for our militia!"
baltimare.10.b:0 "With big guns, we'll destroy the reactionaries!"
baltimare.10.c:0 "If we rule the sky with planes, we will gain an advantage."
baltimare.11.t:0 "Baltimare Asks For Equipment"
baltimare.11.d_bal_rifles:0 "An urgent telegram has arrived from the Workers' Republic of Baltimare, who are embroiled in a dire conflict with reactionaries. They are humbly asking for us to send them rifles, helmet, granades and other infantry equipment, so they can raise more troops for battle. While it is clear we should generously aid our comrades, we should consider if we can afford to do so. Our own military remains the highest priority for us."
baltimare.11.d_bal_guns:0 "An urgent telegram has arrived from the Workers' Republic of Baltimare, who are embroiled in a dire conflict with reactionaries. They are humbly asking for us to send them heavy guns, which they have a complete lack of. With them, they could easily destroy their ill-equipped foes from afar. While it is clear we should generously aid our comrades, we should consider if we can afford to do so. Our own military remains the highest priority for us."
baltimare.11.d_bal_planes:0 "An urgent telegram has arrived from the Workers' Republic of Baltimare, who are embroiled in a dire conflict with reactionaries. They are humbly asking for us to send them fighter planes, so they can secure air superiority and gain a considerable advantage against their enemies. While it is clear we should generously aid our comrades, we should consider if we can afford to do so. Our own military remains the highest priority for us."
baltimare.11.a:0 "Of course, prepare a shipment immediately!"

Apparently Stalliongrad, despite having numerous military factories and a vast military compared to ours, cannot "afford" to send any equipment we requested. Those who proposed this idea are now being mocked in the Congress."

baltimare.14.t:0 "Down With The Princesses!"
baltimare.14.d:0 ""No more princesses, the pedestals shall fall!"\n\nSlogans such as this echoed on the streets of Baltimare as a mass rally against monarchism was organized. Propaganda about the corruption, incompetence and even cruelty of Celestia, Luna, Cadance and Twilight was blasted with loudspeakers and any statues of alicorns toppled and defaced. Grafitti art of an obese Celestia gorging on cake soon decorated walls and Luna was referred to as "Lunatic". Some known supporters of the princesses were dragged out of their homes, then humiliated, mocked and beaten for their childish delusions. The largest statue, depicting Celestia and standing in the central square of the city, was blindfolded by a pegasus, then theatrically "executed" by a firing squad, and finally detonated with dynamite.\n\nAnarchists and communists, syndicalists and socialists, all participated in the event, for once united as one."

The leftists of the city organized a large event dedicated entirely to discredit the institution of monarchy, to mock the princesses, and to beat up those ponies who remained loyal to them. Grafitti art of an obese Celestia gorging on cake decorated walls and Luna was referred to as "Lunatic". Any monuments depicting the princesses were toppled and defaced. The most curious example was the theatrical "execution" and the following demolition of the large statue of Princess Celestia standing in the central square of Baltimare."

baltimare.16.d:0 "The official reason for the violence was suppressing potential counter-revolutionary opposition to the regime of the Congress. But the real reasons were far more varied: Fear, paranoia, revenge, built-up anger, distrust and more. In any case, it was blatantly against the values of friendship and harmony which had so recently been abandoned in Baltimare.\n\nAnarchist mobs, syndicalist and communist militias, death squads of the IU, all attacked perceived reactionaries without mercy, everywhere in the Republic. Former landowners, businessponies, factory bosses, monarchists and more were violently abused, sent to internment camps or simply executed without trial. The violence especially focused on thestrals, who were seen as lunarist sympathisers and supporters of tyrannical Commander Stars Whirl. Temples of the natives in Kululu Forest were looted and burnt down, and priests hunted. Religion had no place in a revolutionary republic either, and the "sun god" of the natives was seen as a ridiculous culmination of naive Celestia-worship.\n\nAfter a week, some socialists began to realize they had gone too far. Golden Delicious and Cricket Chafer urged their militiaponies to stand down and end the violence, yet few obeyed immediately. It took many more bloodied days before it finally stopped."

baltimare.18.t:0 "Anti-Anarchist Crackdown"
baltimare.18.d:0 "Today PON and IU managed to push a controversial piece of legislation through the Congress: All private arms were now forbidden, and a powerful "non-political" police force would be formed, separate from trade union militias. This made anarchists and syndicalists so outraged that they marched out of the city hall in protest, but there was nothing they could now do.\n\nThe law was immediately enforced on the next day. Lavender Berry became the head of the newly established Baltimare Police which immediately went to work disarming anarchists and syndicalists away from the frontline. Understandably, many of them feared that this was but the first step, and that the next step would be dismantling all communes and industrial committees as well as nationalizing remaining collectives, so the resistance to the disarmament was fierce. Fighting broke out in Baltimare itself as anarchists refused to give up their weapons. Golden Delicious demanded the immediate removal of Lavender Berry from office, while Cricket Chafer tried to broker a ceasefire between the two sides, fearing it would escalate, spread and tear their young nation in half.\n\nAfter seveal days of chaos, all parties in the Congress appealed to the fighters to stand down and the fighting dissipated. Thousands of anarcho-syndicalists were arrested, many of them members in Congress. Soon Golden Delicious realized most of his supporters now sat behind bars."

baltimare.19.d:0 "Today CAN and TER managed to push a controversial piece of legislation through the Congress: Many responsibilities and powers of the body would be delegated to lower levels of government, to local municipalities and communes. This made communists and state socialists so outraged that they marched out of the city hall in protest, but there was nothing they could now do.\n\nThe law immediately went to effect and communes formed their own councils. They were now responsible for their own legislation, healthcare, law enforcement, military, education and so on. In fact, the Congress was left with so little power that most communists no longer saw any reason to stay in it and resigned. Several protests to this change arrived from Stalliongrad, which feared that the revolution was now critically endangered. Fresh militiapony recruits found this strange as they joined the reserves of Baltimare, ready to take up arms and defend their homes more eagerly than ever before."

The armies of our enemies lie scattered and broken as they flee deeper into the jungles where they aim to continue their misguided resistance. Workers cheer across the peninsula as the time of suffering and conflict finally comes to a decisive end. Congratulations arrive from all socialist parties of the world and communist nations race to recognize our country as legitimate. Stalliongrad is already setting up an embassy in Baltimare. The temprorary Congress had its last session where it formally dissolved itself and formed a national People's Parliament to succeed it. Elections would soon take place.\n\nBut the peace won't last forever. It is certain we will have to fight for our freedom and independence as counter-revoltutionary ideas continue to prevail abroad. We must prepare while we can and regain our lost strength, so we are ready to receive the storm when it inevitably comes."

baltimare.21.d:0 "The syndicalists of Sicameon have returned from the frontline to the harbour in Baltimare. A thousand arrived, 612 are now preparing to leave back home, among them Jorge Orellana who saw action in battle. He took part in repulsing a thestral night attack, chased a native with a bayonet and bombed a Celestial loyalist trench with a grenade. Unfortunately, near the end of the war he was wounded by a sniper's bullet. While he was able to continue acting in command, he no longer fought in person, and has now received medical treatment by Mage Meadowbrook herself.\n\nHe has promised to Golden Delicious, who had become his good friend during the war, that he would write a novel based on his experiences while he waited for his wound to fully healed."

baltimare.22.t:0 "The New Republic"
baltimare.22.d:0 "Today, the provisional government has proclaimed the establishment of the South-Eastern Socialist Republic, the sole legitimate state on the peninsula. While some regarded the news with scepticism and pessimism, most of the urban populace in the south-east has wholeheartedly welcomed the revolution. Working conditions during the war have been unbearable in most places, so the promises of workers' ownership of production and fewer working hours have pleased many. New democratic workers' councils and committees are already being established across the peninsula.\n\nHowever, the largely untamed countryside remains a different matter. Native tribes, ignorant of socialism, view it as a foreign threat that wishes to eradicate their way of life. Thestrals, distrusted by Baltimareans and persecuted in many cities, are preparing to wage guerilla warfare in the jungles. Many Equestrian settlers who live on farms especially near Stableside look forward to land reform, but those who own the most land are afraid it will all be taken away from them.\n\nIt is clear more work has to be done for the entire populace to be turned to our side, but this is only the beginning."

baltimare.23.d:0 "Today was supposed to be the day when elections were held. Voting ballots had been prepared across the country and political campaigning had lasted for weeks. But the anarchists of CAN had different ideas.\n\nMasked militants raided voting stations across the country, burned ballot papers and vandalized government buildings which had only recently been occupied by workers' councils. Many of the militants belonged to SESR's revolutionary army, and thus there was little opposition strong enough to stop them.\n\nWhen the anarchists realized that no one would stop them, their actions escalated. They spread out from city to city, overthrowing any nascent governmental institutions that had been established in recent weeks, and made their way towards Baltimare. There, a small battle was fought before Golden Delicious intervened and ordered his loyal militiaponies to stand down and end the bloodshed. He convinced Cricket Chafer to flee the country and entered negotiations with the anarchists.\n\nSeveral days later, the SESR turned out to be stillborn as it was formally dismantled. The People's Parliament was no more, and any remaining military units had to either join the anarchist militias or give up their weapons. The rule of government and state in the south-east had ended."

baltimare.24.t:0 "An Unexpected Event"
baltimare.24.d:0 "Today was supposed to be the day when elections were held. Voting ballots had been prepared across the country and political campaigning had lasted for weeks. But then, while speaking in Stableside to a large audience, Golden Delicious was shot and killed by an unknown assailant. He had been one of the most popular candidates for the position of chairpony and the leader of the anarcho-syndicalist TER organisation which was participating in the elections like a regular party. His death resulted in a plummet of support for TER, so the other popular candidate, Cricket Chafer, was confident in his victory. Indeed when the election results finally came in, he won by a landslide and his party, PON, took control of the Parliament.\n\nBut one day something strange happened. Cricket announced in public that he would step down, and that a coalition would be formed between PON and IU. He said that there had been an attempt on his life and was now so afraid that he would retire back to his maize farm near Saltlickingham. The police chief Lavender Berry would assume temporary control over the government.\n\nWhat followed was a widespread purge of the government. Almost all members of PON party and other, smaller parties were arrested, suspected of participating in the murder of Golden Delicious, leaving IU the sole party in control. Lavender Berry also assumed emergency powers which he claimed were needed to ensure the guilty were found and put to justice."

baltimare.25.t:0 "The [GetYear] Elections"
baltimare.25.d:0 "Today was finally the day for the elections. Due to the country needing all kinds of leaders on all levels, parliamentary elections and elections for the chairpony were held simultaneously. Voting ballots had been prepared across the country and political campaigning had lasted for weeks. Of course, there were plenty of complaints that all the ponies running for office were socialists, communists or trade union members, but they still represented diverse values and as such most eligible voters found some representative they largely agreed with.\n\nWhile the candidates for both the People's Parliament and the position of chairpony were numerous, in the end it became clear that two parties and two ponies dominated the vote: Golden Delicious of TER and Cricket "Pig" Chafer of PON. Both had gained fame during the fighting and were liked for their more moderate, reformist policies which appealed to those who were sceptical about socialism. Golden was an anarcho-syndicalist and strived for federalism and libertarian policies, while Cricket was a more traditional communist who nevertheless favoured a slow and patient transition to communism with the wise guidance of the state.\n\nAfter the first round of voting only these two remained. The second round would decide who would lead the nation for the near future."

Neo-feudalism demands a radical return to traditional hierarchies, with nobles owning all land in the nation, and the peasants bound to the land in turn. Factory workers fare no better, being bound to the factories they work at. Peasants and urban workers have barely any rights, being only just above slaves, and can be ordered to work or be conscripted as the nobility desires. Neo-feudalism accepts elements of modern society such as factories and science as useful, but refuses to let them erode the old hierarchies it deems necessary."

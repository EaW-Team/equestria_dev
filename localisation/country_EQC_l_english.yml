### LEADER DESCRIPTIONS ###
snooty_noble_desc:0 "Member of the Canterlot elite, Jet Set is staunchly devoted to the ideals of tradition and harmony. Although his detractors call him out of touch with the common ponies, his business sense is impeccable and he has the right idea of how to get New Mareland back on track. His decision to accept the Princess' invitation to the position of Governor-General came from the desire to show his peers that he is more than a shallow socialite, although his beloved wife, Upper Crust, may have encouraged him. Jet Set firmly believes in the motto of "Keep calm and carry on!" and tries to steer New Mareland into a brighter future, no matter the situation."
probably_mosley_desc:0 "Former army general turned politician, Duke Haygle is a strong believer in the maxim of might makes right. His notable oratory skills and personal magnetism have attracted many ponies, who are concerned about the hostile griffon nations, to his cause. Prim and proper, he will do everything to keep New Mareland and its ponies safe from the looming griffon invasion on the horizon."
TRUMP_desc:0 "Entrepreneur and philanthropist, Gladmane comes from a nouveau riche family, notable for their hotel chains and multiple casino resorts in the beautiful city of Las Pegasus. However, a series of mistakes led to him leaving the city in disgrace, upon which he decided to seek a new area for his businesses. Arriving in New Mareland to examine a golf course he wished to purchase, he saw an opportunity and became determined to personally solve the country's woes in his unique way. Now president of the newly independent Equestrian colony, Gladmane seeks to make this country great again!"
yet_another_huey_long_desc:0 "Kingfisher, former governor of Celestia, now president of the Commonwealth, is an outspoken populist, dedicated to helping the poor and downtrodden of New Mareland. Believing that the other candidates won't lift a hoof to help the truly needy, Kingfisher campaigned for the office on the promises of redistributing the wealth centered in conglomerates and corporations. Attracted by his pledges, the ponies have elected Kingfisher, and now he returns the favour by implementing his policies."
generic_gommie_pony_desc:0 "Hailing from an average middle class family that has resided all their lives in Sunset, Lufty Star became attracted to the nascent communist ideology when she was introduced to it in a college lecture. From then, she became enamored with the idea of introducing socialist values to New Mareland ever since. Her drive and action have resulted in the former Governor-General declaring that the ponies have spoken. Since then, she leads New Mareland in her vision of the Stalliongradian socialism."
hyper_equality_pone_desc:0 "Blueberry Frost was one of the many who participated in Starlight Glimmer's idea of equality, but Starlight was exposed as a fraud. This did not deter Blueberry, who fled across the sea in search of a new ground to spread equality, which would, this time, be honest to its ideals and ensured nopony was left behind in poverty. Tired of being trapped in the woes of economical depression, the ponies have chosen her to resolve New Mareland's issues and lead them to a new, equal time."
the_party_desc:0 "MARESOC is a Newspeak term that stands for Marelander Socialism, which gives the Party its name. The other name for their ideology is oligarchical collectivism. The two aims of MARESOC are to bring the revolution to the people and to destroy the capitalists and foreigners who wish to oppress them. The two aims of MARESOC are the complete political domination of the populace and the pursuit of power for its own sake.\n\nWAR IS PEACE.\nFREEDOM IS SLAVERY.\nIGNORANCE IS STRENGTH."
here_comes_1984_desc:0 "Big Sister is the leader of MARESOC and the founder of the Party. She has been the guardian of the revolution since its earliest days. She is infallible and all-powerful. All good things have come from her and her alone. It is only under her stern but gentle guidance that we flourish.\n\nMARESOC is a Newspeak term that stands for Marelander Socialism, which gives the Party its name. The other name for their ideology is oligarchical collectivism. The two aims of MARESOC are to bring the revolution to the people and to destroy the capitalists and foreigners who wish to oppress them. The two aims of MARESOC are the complete political domination of the populace and the pursuit of power for its own sake.\n\nThere will be no loyalty, except loyalty towards the Party. There will be no love, except the love of Big Sister. There will be no laughter, except the laugh of triumph over a defeated enemy."
smol_spore_leader_desc:0 "Candy Garden has two passions in her life - devotion to the Princess and digging quality trenches. Her tenure as a general has been nothing short of exemplary. She has always been concerned with the state not showing proper reverence to the Princess, and the recent turn of events have resulted in her leading a coup against the traitors. With the proper order restored, she serves the Princess of the Sun once again."
albino_sunhorse_desc:0 "Arcane Nova is one of the finer military minds that have sprung out from the new order in Equestria. Steadfast and astute, she has accepted the Empress' summons to personally oversee the troublesome colony. She ensures that the Sun is properly praised at all times, and any dissidents are swiftly removed."
that_tsundere_from_eqg_desc:0 "Sour Sweet, a notable member of the community by day, a deceptive chairmare of an ancient secret society by night, leads the reformed state of New Mareland. Although the Shadowbolt Society did not expect the Nightmare to actually return and assume control of Equestria by force, they have enthusiastically rallied behind Nightmare Moon and have taken control over the country. Her many ties within the society ensures her administration has a smooth reign turning the colony into a devoted dependency of the Lunar Empire."
another_edgy_bat_desc:0 "Evening Dew comes from a long line of Nightmare Moon supporters. His family has never forgiven Princess Celestia for her actual and perceived slights against them, and they've been plotting the Nightmare's return for over centuries. Until recently, this was characterised by holding seance sessions in abandoned houses and inciting other batponies towards rebellion. Suave and terrifying, Evening Dew was one of the first to join the Dark Mistress' side, and his devotion has not gone unrewarded."
kuche_desc:0 "Born in an abusive, impoverished family, Flawless Glow has never had an easy way in life. Already an outcast because of her thestral nature, she was forced to become part of the local criminal syndicate to make ends meet. These years have instilled a devoted, zealous nature in Flawless Glow, and much like many of her kind, she became interested in the tale of Nightmare Moon. Once she started receiving dreams from the Nightmare, she eagerly joined her cause and became notable for her fanatical tendencies. After the dust settled, she accepted the Dark Mistress' request to lead the Lunar Empire's armies in the foreign lands of Griffonia, although some suspect her selection was influenced by being close to a certain Grand Admiral. Nonethless, Flawless Glow is now one of the premier military leaders in New Mareland and uses every method in her arsenal to ensure that the ponies are obedient to the Night."
cijik_desc:0 "Nightlight Charm is a former radio host known for her passionate deliveries of news reports. Although she loved her job, bringing smiles to the ponies of Manehattan, she always felt like she could aspire to something more. After a particularly harrowing report of the "Cockatrice War" from across the sea, and partially due to a dare from her colleagues, she decided to join the military academy and prove herself. Much to her surprise, her leadership skills were above the norm, and her experience allowed her to take advantage of the new military communication technology. Unfortunately, anti-thestral bias was still pervasive in Equestria, and Nightlight Charm decided to seek a place where she wouldn't be discriminated for her nature. Although she sometimes receives personal attacks, she has found that New Mareland is a much better, accepting place for her."
smol_spore_desc:0 "Candy Garden has two passions in her life - devotion to the Princess and digging quality trenches. Her tenure as a general has been nothing short of exemplary, and the earth ponies under her command are just as qualified in constructing expertly made fortifications. When questioned about the unusually high amount of earth ponies compared to other pony races in her units, she replied that only a dependable pony with all four hooves on the ground can be relied upon to deliver her requirements."
EQC_Moonlight_poppy_desc:0 "Born in Manehattan, Moonlight Poppy moved to New Manehattan at a young age. There, she studied at a military academy, altough her true passion was always psychology. In time, she found that her psychological expertise proved very useful when commanding troops, and she quickly rose through the ranks during the severe fighting in the recent "Cockatrice War"."
anja_snow_desc:0 "Anja originated from Fillydelphia and always had problems fitting in. Since her early days, she had problematic relations with companions, because she was mostly viewed as something obscure considering being half Batpony and half Pegasus.\n\nAfter graduating she joined the equestrian Military and later was selected for the Lunar Night Guard because of her ability to fly, and fight under though conditions in the darkest nights. But soon the batponies saw in her as a competitor and wanted her to fail. She realized she gained more foes than friends, as she's inherited more advantages from Pegasus abilities. She transferred to the Royal New Mareland Night Guard in late 1006 hoping to make a new start."
Sparky_desc:0 "Sparky, born in 981, went to Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns at a young age, where she learned about her special talent of solving disputes between others. Besides that, she also soon became very skilled in teleportation magic which she trained to near perfection. Her record was teleporting twenty-five ponies at once, though such an act was of course very taxing. After her graduation she went to the officer academy, where she originally trained as a medic, but soon discovered how much easier it was for her to teleport immovable objects, so she joined a logistics unit instead. Given Equestria's peacefulness, she requested to be send to New Mareland, as they were in a dangerous position on Griffonia and she hoped to make a difference over there. Her request was granted, so at the 1st of January 1003 she arrived in New Mareland. Since the day of her arrival, she alleviates tensions between the local griffons and ponies, making sure that anyone at least in her region gets along. To this day, she also makes sure that the border guard are always well supplied, especially in these uncertain times. Nopony knows what might happen in Wingbardy, given the recent events in Karthin, and the possibility of an extremist uprising worries her. But no matter what comes, Sparky will stand with New Mareland even if times should get difficult."

 ### FOCUS ###
 #Go with Equestria
 EQC_strengthen_equestrian_ties:0 "Strengthen Equestrian Ties"
 EQC_strengthen_equestrian_ties_desc:0 "We may be New Marelanders, but we were all once Equestrians. We are still loyal subjects to the Princesses and share many common bonds with our brothers and sisters across the sea.\n\nWe should reaffirm our commitments to our fellow Equestrians, and bind our destiny to theirs."
 
 EQC_royal_visit:0 "The Royal Visit"
 EQC_royal_visit_desc:0 "It has been almost a generation since a Princess of Equestria has visited New Mareland. We should offer an invitation to one of the four Equestrian Princesses to show the friendship between our nations, and strengthen our mutual bond."
 
 EQC_school_for_gifted_unicorns:0 "New Mareland School for Gifted Unicorns"
 EQC_school_for_gifted_unicorns_desc:0 "Most Unicorns with a talent for magic leave New Mareland for Canterlot, to go to one of the prestigious schools there. This causes an unfortunate brain drain for us. Establishing our own academy for the study of the arcane would help our scientifically and magical foundation tremendously."
 
 EQC_school_of_friendship:0 "New Mareland School of Friendship"
 EQC_school_of_friendship_desc:0 "A School of Friendship, similar to the one near Ponyville in Equestria, could help to improve our relations with different countries tremendously. Such a school would also not be exclusive to Unicorns, unlike the other option currently on the table."


 #Equestrian Investment and Welfare
 EQC_equestrian_investors:0 "Equestrian Investors"
 EQC_equestrian_investors_desc:0 "New Mareland has always been an attractive target for investment, and recent tensions on the Griffonian continent have only solidified that, as many Ponies back in Equestria are anxious about their assets in Griffonia, and are willing to relocate them here. If we set up initiatives and simplify the process it could become quite profitable for us, especially since the well-known Rich family has shown interest."
 
 EQC_attract_immigrants:0 "Immigration Campaign"
 EQC_attract_immigrants_desc:0 "While New Mareland is not a small country by any means, we still have plenty of room for more. By launching a campaign promoting the immigration to New Mareland, especially among Equestrian citizens, we should be able to greatly increase our population growth and most likely our industrial capabilities in the long run."
 
 EQC_transoceanic_support:0 "Transoceanic Support"
 EQC_transoceanic_support_desc:0 "While New Mareland has many great ponies and organisations to be proud of, Equestria still has the numbers over us. We should approach those who can assist our nation and offer them a hoof in friendship."
 
 EQC_national_housing_act:0 "National Housing Act"
 EQC_national_housing_act_desc:0 "The Great Depression has left many of our citizens homeless and without shelter. This can stand no longer! Every pony living in New Mareland must have a roof over their head. The National Housing Act will see to the construction of many new homes and apartments in our cities, to allow everybody a place of shelter."
 
 EQC_land_grants:0 "Land Grants"
 EQC_land_grants_desc:0 "There is much unused land all over New Mareland. This is rather inefficient, since they simply do not have the population and technology to exploit the vast swathes of land under their control. Appropriating these lands for state use would allow us to properly develop and use them for the betterment of New Mareland."
 
 EQC_national_parks:0 "Parks and Recreation"
 EQC_national_parks_desc:0 "Instead of turning the vast swathes of unused lands into farmlands and industrial centres, we should turn them into great parks, under national protection and free from any outside influences. This will please the locals greatly, and also allow all of our citizen to be able to spend their holidays in these beautiful places."
 
 EQC_basic_incom:0 "Universal Basic Income"
 EQC_basic_incom_desc:0 "There is widespread poverty in New Mareland, especially in the big cities. One way to ease the burden on our citizens would be to institute a basic income system. This would ensure that nopony in New Mareland will have to go hungry or face other harsh financial choices."
 
 EQC_solidify_self_determination:0 "Partners, not Puppets"
 EQC_solidify_self_determination_desc:0 "We may have willingly bound ourselves to Equestria and the Princesses, but that does not mean we cannot be our own nation. There may yet come a day when we must part from Equestria. That day is not yet here, but we must be prepared for the possibility. Our right to self-determination is sacred, even if we may not always make use of it."


 #Government in exile
 EQC_government_in_exile:0 "A Government in Exile"
 EQC_government_in_exile_desc:0 "Equestria, our ancient homeland, has fallen! We must reevaluate our position in the world now that so many of our fellow ponies are living under oppression. New Mareland will start by sheltering all who flee from war and oppression, including the Royalty itself!"

 EQC_unite_the_nation:0 "Unite the Nation"
 EQC_unite_the_nation_desc:0 "While the fall of Equestria saddens all our hearts, all is not yet lost as long as a pony still lives in freedom. The prospect of returning home to reclaim our Equestrian home gives us strength and unity. We know deep down, that if we all do our part, Equestria will be free!"
 EQC_fund_the_resistence:0 "Fund the Resistance"
 EQC_fund_the_resistence_desc:0 "The enemy might have occupied our home across the sea, but there are still ponies who actively resist their rule. We will do everything we can to help and support these brave ponies! To coordinate this effort from across the seas, we need to devote much of our staff, both civilian and military. But all of it will be worth it in the end. For Equestria!"
 EQC_build_a_grand_fleet:0 "Build a Grand Fleet"
 EQC_build_a_grand_fleet_desc:0 "To reach the coast of Equestria alive, we must initiate the largest naval buildup in Equestrian history. This will not be an easy task, but all the knowledge and workforce that our friends brought from Equestria will help us out We will show everyone the combined might of Equestrian and New Mareland friendship and build a fleet worthy of guiding our Princess home!"
 EQC_gather_our_friends:0 "Gather our Friends"
 EQC_gather_our_friends_desc:0 "While our ponies are eager to return home and push back the foreign invaders, we simply cannot defeat them alone. It is time to plead for help, time to unite our friends on this continent under our leadership to bring about the return of peace and harmony for all. We will show them the true magic of friendship!"
 EQC_the_homecoming:0 "The Homecoming"
 EQC_the_homecoming_desc:0 "The Time has finally come. The build-up, the rallies, all our preparations have led up to this final moment. Our great struggle against evil begins now. We have the fullest confidence that we will liberate our Equestrian friends and restore Harmony! For Equestria, for Harmony, to Victory!"

 #Break Free from Equestria
 EQC_patriation:0 "Patriation"
 EQC_patriation_desc:0 "We can no longer rely on Equestria for help. They have proven that they have no interest in our plight. The only hope for New Mareland is to seek our own path in the world."

 EQC_commonwelth_congress:0 "Unite Congress"
 EQC_commonwelth_congress_desc:0 "While we have committed to independence, there are many in Congress who still resist. If we are to build a better New Mareland, then we must stand united."

 EQC_let_all_have_a_say:0 "Let All Have a Say"
 EQC_let_all_have_a_say_desc:0 "While the ways of Harmony have forever been a part of our nation, there are other ideas that are as equally valid. We must make sure that everypony's voice is heard."

 EQC_support_the_harmonists:0 "Support the Harmonists"
 EQC_support_the_harmonists_desc:0 "Just because we want independence we don't have to change who we are. We are still ponies and we still love peace and harmony."

 EQC_the_election:0 "Sign the Declaration of Independence"
 EQC_the_election_desc:0 "The negotiations are complete and the bills have been approved. There are now only a few signatures between us and independence."

 EQC_open_banks_to_griffons_desc:0 "The griffons are swimming in money, but their constant wars mean that none of it is safe. We should offer a safe place for their money in exchange for protection. All we ask is a little and totally fair fee."

 EQC_bust_the_monopolies_desc:0 "Just like the feudal system, the big businesses are lying on the commonpony, holding them in bondage for wages that do not cover the larger scale expenses.

 EQC_public_works_projects:0 "Public Works Program"
 EQC_public_works_projects_desc:0 "With unemployment rife after the Great Depression, we will need to find jobs for them, in part to gather votes and in part for the bettement of the ponies.

It is a virtuous cycle, shaped by trust and by mutual benefit."

 EQC_affordable_utilities:0 "Pass the Affordable Utilities Act"
 EQC_affordable_utilities_desc:0 "To lay a foundation for anypony, for any purpose is to start with the necessities.

 EQC_the_only_defence_against_communism:0 "Our Only Defence Against Communism"
 EQC_the_only_defence_against_communism_desc:0 "Communism is threatening our fair Mareland, its tendrils creeping into every part of our way of life.

 EQC_civil_rights:0 "Pass the Civil Rights Act"
 EQC_civil_rights_desc:0 "The Griffons have long been part of New Mareland, but under our noses and have been subject to severe limitations. But they are ponies, one and all.

It is time for New Mareland to get out of the shade of State's Rights and walk forthrightly into the bright sunshine of Equal Rights!"

 EQC_token_reforms:0 "Token Reforms"
 EQC_token_reforms_desc:0 "Though the Griffons have cried out for equal rights with the rest of New Mareland, we are now forced to admit that the current ideas just don't cut it with Parliament. Even if Executive Orders can do a lot, we are still missing a law to get things into shape. Even if it is nothing but a show of good faith, we will make some token reforms where we can and get on with our agenda."

 EQC_imperial_presidency:0 "The Imperial Presidency"
 EQC_imperial_presidency_desc:0 "Since Kingfisher took office, all politics have radiated out, not from the Mareland Congress, but rather from the Lodge nearby.

 EQC_perfect_democracy:0 "Perfect The Democratic System"

 EQC_no_south_griffon_commies_desc:0 "Communism. A disease of the soul. Wherever it spreads, rot and devastation follow.

We will stand against them, wherever they might be. We shall not be bowed."
 
 EQC_join_the_concordant:0 "Join the Concordat"
 EQC_join_the_concordant_desc:0 "To the east, we stand before the Concordat. Both are democratic nations that have taken a stand against tyranny, wherever it might be.

 EQC_join_the_research:0 "Join the Southern Technological Group"
 EQC_join_the_research_desc:0 "Though we have joined with the griffons in Sicameon and the Minotaurs in Asterion, we have much to learn from each other still. The Concordat, even though it is fine as a military alliance can be taken further. We will join the already existing cooperation between the two founding nations and create something larger for all of us."

 EQC_build_now_play_later:0 "Build Now; Pay Later"
 EQC_build_now_play_later_desc:0 "It is imperative that we quickly build up our industry and for that we will need money and resources. For this, our industrial ministers have come up with the BNPL program, although it wasn't intended to fund arms productions at first. We shall promise to pay the notes back later, after the economy has improved. Or when the Duke decides we have no need of our creditors' support anymore."

 EQC_autarky:0 "Autarky"
 EQC_autarky_desc:0 "We have learned what reliance on others gives us. Economic depression and a shattered national spirit. Thus, we must establish total self-reliance and eliminate the need for any foreign trade. This will enable us to be our nation and we shall be strong without any foreign state holding us down!"

 EQC_seize_control:0 "Seize Control"
 EQC_seize_control_desc:0 "With the reforms we have implemented and by favouring our supporters in government promotions, we have accrued a lot of power in the executive and judiciary branches of government and key positions in the media. Our influence goes so far that we can use trials and fabricated scandals to get rid of those who speak out against us. Nopony can escape the Duke's iron hoof now!"

 EQC_three_year_plan:0 "The Three-Year Plan"
 EQC_three_year_plan_desc:0 "To facilitate economic recovery and to prepare the economy for a state of war, we will have to implement a 3-year government austerity plan. Although many of the budget cuts will be unpopular, the ponies at the propaganda ministry are convinced that they can convince the population that everypony must do their part and be thrifty for the good of the nation."

 EQC_empower_the_army:0 "Empower the Army"
 EQC_empower_the_army_desc:0 "We shall strengthen the army as a leading force, normalising a reduced form of martial law. By doing this we will be able to increase funding to the army. Furthermore, by giving them some policing duties, they get the chance to exercise against the disloyal parts of our citizenry, saving us the cost of prisons while giving the armed forces invaluable experience. Long live the Army! Long live New Mareland!"

 EQC_section_13:0 "Section 13"
 EQC_section_13_desc:0 "We cannot withstand an attack by a united Griffonia. Our only hope is to find new ways of fighting wars and killing the outside menace. A new research taskforce should be set up to investigate biological, chemical and other means of eliminating our enemies."

 EQC_expand_the_stormponies:0 "Haygalian Dialectics"
 EQC_expand_the_stormponies_desc:0 "When two ideals conflict, the Synthesis is created. It is where the ideals mix and become a new idea to solve the dispute. And for the griffons, they are not beneath ponies and ponies are not beneath them. They all serve a higher purpose in life, serving their country and their flag."

 EQC_work_for_the_nation:0 "Work for the Nation"
 EQC_work_for_the_nation_desc:0 "From now on, the most patriotic citizens can sign themselves into voluntary servitude to the state to reduce unemployment. In exchange for their most honourable service, their families will gain a standard income. These flexible labourers will surely help our economy. Some ponies might say this sounds like slavery, but only through the state can there be any liberty. Well that is what the propaganda will say."

 EQC_nation_works_projects:0 "Working Patriots"
 EQC_nation_works_projects_desc:0 "We can now fund the Working Patriots organisation. They will recruit members from the workless and travel the nation constructing roads and other useful services. This will surely attract the unemployed. That the funding for the Working Patriots comes at the cost of money for organisations that don't require anything for the ponies they help, is just a necessary side effect."

 EQC_united_shadowworks:0 "United Shadow-works"
 EQC_united_shadowworks_desc:0 "Many high-ranking members of New Mareland's government are united in a society known as the Shadowbolt Society. While they have often spoken out against the Party, this small ruling club could prove useful if brought under hoof."

 EQC_a_deal_with_the_duce_desc:0 "In neighbouring Wingbardy, a griffon named Giulio Beakolini has come to power with his PNF party. They are ideologically aligned with us and could serve as a useful ally. While he is a griffon, the bird is known as a strong leader and a patriot. His ideology is more important to us than his lineage, at least for now. If the Duce will make sure his griffons don't spill over into our land, we will tolerate working within his 'Pact'."

 EQC_stand_against_griffons:0 "The Torchbearers Of Fascism"
 EQC_stand_against_griffons_desc:0 "Whatever the mad bird in Karthin might say, we are those that hold the torch of Fascism the highest. He claims to have invented fascism, when only the Duke could have though it up, and gained power to put it into practie. He rules by the power of his gangsters. We rule by the power of the people, and with an eternal mandate to carry out their will."

 EQC_war_with_wingbardy:0 "Strike Wingbardy"
 EQC_war_with_wingbardy_desc:0 "It's time to end Wingbardy's autonomy once and for all. We have tolerated their existence for long enough now. One kick through the door and the whole rotten structure will come crashing down."

 EQC_regulated_capitalism:0 "Economic Regulation"
 EQC_regulated_capitalism_desc:0 "Though entrepreneurial spirit made our nation what it is, it can also lead to ruin if left unchecked.

 EQC_break_the_bankers:0 "Banksterism Begone!"
 EQC_break_the_bankers_desc:0 "One needn't look further for the primary culprits of the Depression than the perfidious and reckless bankers of New Mareland. Their runaway speculation and insidious gambling with the futures of our citizens ruined lives and livelihoods. We will make sure that this will never happen again. Even if we have to break a thousand banks and jail thousands of bankers, the little ponies must be defended against this madness."
 
 EQC_defend_democracy:0 "Enshrine Democracy"
 EQC_defend_democracy_desc:0 "From Democracy we came, and to Democracy we shall return. The ponies of New Mareland have made their choice to cast off the chains and to choose their own leaders, free of the Griffonian idea of a 'monarchy' We shall make sure that no matter what, this will carry on."
 
 EQC_pony_citizen_councils:0 "Encourage Pony Citizen Councils"
 EQC_pony_citizen_councils_desc:0 "The government must not be a big presence, lest it later becomes a way for the Banksters to oppress the common pony and the humble equine away from their proper position as rulers. Indeed, the problems are best solved as close to the problem as possible. Not by some Sunset Bureaucrat, but by local ponies, with local skills."
 
 EQC_the_national_guard:0 "The New Mareland National Guard"
 EQC_the_national_guard_desc:0 "Though the Army serves us well, many other ponies want to serve too. It is high time that we give the states their own forces to move around.

 EQC_implement_segregation:0 "Segregation Now, Tomorrow, and Forever!"
 EQC_implement_segregation_desc:0 "Griffons and Ponies are naturally unsuited to mix together in society. Though some may grumble and protest, this is the natural order of things. We were given, by right and gain, this land and we will make sure that it is our land alone. The griffons will stay here, but we shall make a doctrine of 'Separate but Equal'"
 
 EQC_accept_the_bats:0 "Proper Equestrian Equines One and All"
 EQC_accept_the_bats_desc:0 "Across the sea, in the Motherland, they have talked about Thestrals being lesser than the other three tribes. That is wholly untrue. We are all proper Equestrian Equines of proper Equestrian stock. We are all united against the Griffonian Hordes right across our borders. This we must defend as one."
 
 EQC_encourage_them_to_leave:0 "The Tzinacatlia Plan"
 EQC_encourage_them_to_leave_desc:0 "Though the thestrals aren't suited to mix with us, that doesn't mean they're on the same level as the griffons. While the griffons shall toil for the betterment of the Pony, we shall find a homeland for the thestrals, free of our interference, or any interference by foreign powers that aren't, of course, suitably Equine."
 
 EQC_model_communities:0 "Model Pony Communities"
 EQC_model_communities_desc:0 "All across New Mareland, ponies have taken to our ideals. They have gathered in neighbourhoods, showing their own dedication to the modern New Mareland.

 EQC_tuitions_for_ponies:0 "The Schoolhouse Door Act"
 EQC_tuitions_for_ponies_desc:0 "Between the public life and the new President, we must now turn our attention to the schools.

We will revamp education to something proper for the millennium"
 
 EQC_marelandian_recovery:0 "The Mareland Urban Recovery Plan"
 EQC_marelandian_recovery_desc:0 "Since Black Wednesday, several blocks in Sunset and Manebourne have lied derelict, the intended occupants never moving in.

 EQC_the_silver_crescent_doctrine_desc:0 "From Wrobert to Minos, Griffons rule the land, and they would want nothing more than to see our fair lands be spoiled and ravaged by the griffonian hordes. Against this, there can only be one solution. To attack them and bring them under our benevolent and enlightened rule before any expansionist gets any bright ideas to attack us."
 
 EQC_war_with_talouse:0 "The Talousian Expedition"
 EQC_war_with_talouse_desc:0 "Talouse, close to our borders, and increasingly belligerent against us will need to be brought under control. By hook or by crook, they shall come to acknowledge that rule from Sunset will be the best option for all."
 
 EQC_economic_exploitation:0 "The South-Griffonian Free Trade Zone"
 EQC_economic_exploitation_desc:0 "Their economies in ruins, it would only be necessary and proper for us to stick out a helping hoof to the griffons to help them to work once more. However, there is no such thing as a free lunch, and we will expect to be repaid with full interest once the griffons are able to crank out products of their own."
 
 EQC_the_13th_state:0 "The 13th District"
 EQC_the_13th_state_desc:0 "Wrobert, though filled with griffons also holds a small Pony minority. Even if they have been downtrodden by the griffons, we know that any equine, once given the opportunity to rise above their station and to the occasion will perform better as a ruler than any brutish griffon."
 
 EQC_the_14th_state:0 "The Kion Sea Territories"
 EQC_the_14th_state_desc:0 "The islands in the Kion Sea, though they are lacking in resources, are also prime settlement land.

 EQC_form_communist_unions:0 "Form Communist Unions"
 EQC_form_communist_unions_desc:0 "In order to gain autonomy, we need to reduce our dependency on Equestria.

Surely this will only reinforce their democratic ideals."

 EQC_unite_the_left:0 "Unite the Left"
 EQC_unite_the_left_desc:0 "Now that the workers have chosen which faction they wish to lead them into the revolution, we must make sure to bridge the gap between those who still doubt our leadership.

 EQC_liquidate_bourgouise_assets_desc:0 "Though the Revolution is still young, no one can eat and live off air alone. This is a rather nagging problem in general for all ponykind.

 EQC_the_great_trot_forward_desc:0 "We are lagging behind the rest of the world as the creatures around us hurry forward into their own future.

 EQC_implement_democratic_centralism:0 "Implement Democratic Centralism"
 EQC_implement_democratic_centralism_desc:0 "The Party must move forward with a united voice. Though ponies around us may consider it to be an act of dictatorial overreach, we know that the united front must stay united, come Tartarus or high water. Criticism may be allowed, but it must stay behind closed doors."
 
 EQC_bat_communes:0 "Thestral Revolutionary Integration"
 EQC_bat_communes_desc:0 "There is a simple maxim that we all live with. Creatures of the World, Unite! And though a lot of work needs to be done, there can be no unity without equality. And we can take the first steps now. The bat ponies, long repressed and hidden in the shadows will be lifted up and granted the same rights and priviledges as any other pony in New Mareland."
 
 EQC_found_the_RES:0 "Found the RES"
 EQC_found_the_RES_desc:0 "There are many places that are ripe for Revolution in Griffonia. Though they are largely a backwater, they have several places where the workers cry out for liberation.

 EQC_racial_harmony:0 "Racial Harmony"
 EQC_racial_harmony_desc:0 "There will be no such things as racial divisions in the New Mareland. The griffons are as equal comrades and travellers with us as the ponies are.

 EQC_griffon_enfranchisment_desc:0 "The Griffons have long lived in the shadows of the rest of society. A shame. They are a plucky people with a spirit unmatched.

 EQC_socialise_education_desc:0 "Though many reactionaries chose to flee New Mareland in the aftermath of the Revolution, others remained quiet and at their posts as the bunting changed.

 ### EVENTS ###
 mareland.1.t:0 "Make Peace with the Changelings?"
 mareland.1.d:0 "The war is turning rapidly in favour of the Changeling Queendom. Further resistance is always possible, of course, but at this point, we must consider the possibility of seeking a separate piece with the Changelings."
 mareland.1.a:0 "We must save ourselves."
 mareland.1.b:0 "We shall never give up on our fellow ponies!"

 mareland.2.t:0 "[From.GetName] Seeks a White Peace"
 mareland.2.d:0 "Seeing the circumstances of the war slowly turning against them, the ponies in New Mareland wish to sign a separate peace with us, in order to preserve their sovereignty. This would of course end the war with them much earlier than expected, and allow us to focus our attention to other matters. An invasion across the ocean would be difficult to achieve, especially as our control over Equestria itself is yet to be fully secured."
 mareland.2.a:0 "They can have peace, for now."
 mareland.2.b:0 "Peace? Ha!"

 mareland.3.t:0 "Our Offer of Peace Rejected"
 mareland.3.d:0 "This morning, we have received a communique from the [From.GetName], in response to our offer of a separate peace.\nIt seems that it was wishful thinking to hope that this request would be granted. [From.GetLeader] has reaffirmed their hostility to all Equestrian dependencies, and as such, they will finish the war, no matter the cost."
 mareland.3.a:0 "The sea is our wall."

 mareland.4.t:0 "The Royal Visit"
 mareland.4.d:0 "It has been almost a generation since a princess has visited New Mareland. We should offer an invitation to one of the Equestrian princesses to show the friendship between our nations.\n\nBut who shall we invite?"
 mareland.4.a:0 "Princess Celestia for the Summer Sun Celebration."
 mareland.4.b:0 "Princess Luna for Nightmare Night."
 mareland.4.c:0 "Princess Twilight to give a lecture."
 mareland.4.e:0 "Princess Cadance to meet charity workers."

 mareland.5.t:0 "The White Claw Bandits"
 mareland.5.d:0 "Just before dawn, an explosion echoed through Sunset. The source was a toaster factory at the edge of the city. Firefighters worked through the day to tackle the blaze but that didn't stop the police from beginning their investigations. It was indeed sabotage, and it wasn't long until the culprits where identified. Hours after the blast, a letter appeared on the desk of the New Mareland Chronicler's chief editor. It was from a group that called themselves the United Griffon Freedom Front, although the name White Claw Bandits has already been popularised by the tabloids.\n\nThese bandits claim that they object to the forced conscription of griffons into New Mareland's armies with the justification that they want no part in a pony's war and that it is in breach of the Native Freedoms Act of 912.\n\nJustified or not, these criminals have sworn to strike again and there is no knowing when they will stop."
 mareland.5.a:0 "We must bring them to justice!"

 mareland.6.t:0 "Ally with Griffons"
 mareland.6.d:0 "There are many griffon states who share our communist ideas. But, sadly, they are divided and believe in spreading Communism in their own ways. We have chosen to seek friendship with one of these states, but in doing so we will unfortunately upset the others.\n\nWe must choose wisely, for the future of both New Mareland and the World Revolution is at stake."

 mareland.6.c:0 "[GRW.GetName]!"
 mareland.6.e:0 "Wait, where did they go?!"

 mareland.7.t:0 "The New Manehattan Explosion"
 mareland.7.d:0 "A huge explosion in the New Manehattan harbour shook the entire city, its blast heard by ponies all the way in Sunset. The New Manehattan Police Department reports that the explosion was an accident, caused by a collision of two ships. One was an empty cargo ship that was moving through the harbour, while the other one was an incoming ship carrying munitions.\n\nThe captain of the unfilled cargo ship did not expect the munitions ship and couldn't stop in time, even though it did throw out its anchor. The pointed bow of the vessel tore through the starboard side of the other ship. Despite desperate attempts of the crew to save the ship, fire reached the ammunition. The explosion that followed destroyed almost half of the New Manehattan harbour. Resources, ships and most importantly, almost two thousand souls were lost in the tragedy. Although some ponies were saved by rescuers, many more are still missing as the emergency services search the blast site. Meanwhile, firefighters are still fighting the raging fire in the port area.\n\nThe events in New Manehattan threw the entire country into mourning. The Harbormaster's Office, which was outside of the blast radius, has been turned into a makeshift memorial. There, ponies from all over the city stop by to bring flowers and pay their respects to the victims of this tragic accident."
 mareland.7.a:0 "A terrible tragedy."

 mareland.8.t:0 "Something in the Deep"
 mareland.8.d:0 "A month ago, the SS Sunny Hauler, a [EQC.GetAdjective] cargo ship, vanished in the mid-Celestial Sea. While the search was extensive, it was deemed that the ship had sunk with all lives lost. That is, until this morning.\n\nA lifeboat washed up on the shores of the Great Cross. Inside was a pony identified as a crew member of the SS Sunny Hauler. He was highly agitated and lashed out at his rescuers. Eventually, they calmed down enough to recount their chilling tell.\n\nIt turns out that the SS Sunny Hauler had found themselves trapped in thick fog at night, in the middle of the ocean. From there his account turned into one of incoherent ramblings about \"something in the water\" and \"the sweetest music ever heard\". Eventually, the crew of the ship turned on their crew mates and brutally fought each other to the death.\n\nThe crewpony found themselves thrown overboard, adrift in the lifeboat. It was there they witnessed the something they could only describe as \"them\" rise from the waves to feast on what remained below dragging the ship below the sea. When asked for more they could only answer with, \"they have returned.\""
 mareland.8.a:0 "We should watch the waters..."

 mareland.9.t:0 "Companies Demand BNPL Payment"
 mareland.9.desc:0 "With the end of the recent war, the companies we have issued BNPL bills to are now pushing for us to issue payments. They claim there is no longer any necessity to withhold payments "for the good of the Commonwealth"."
 mareland.9.a:0 "Very well."

 mareland.10.t:0 "The Second Cockatrice War"
 mareland.10.d:0 "There has been a growing call among the rural communities for the government to step in and help resolve the rampant issues with wild cockatrices. Claims have been made that the birds are gathering in large herds and ransacking farms and stations. Several compensation claims have been made for farm animals turning into stone, although, fortunately, there are currently no reports that ponies have been hurt.\n\nThey wish for drastic actions to be taken, ideally with military force. This raised some acknowledgement among the greater public due to the humiliating 'defeat' the New Mareland Army Corps suffered in what the media dubbed 'the Cockatrice War'. Several newspapers have already demanded that we get revenge against those birds!\n\nHowever, animal experts and the heads of the military have argued that there is no danger posed by the birds and that any military action will just be a waste of time and money."
 mareland.10.a:0 "We have better ways to waste time and money."
 mareland.10.b:0 "We shall show those birds who's boss!"

 mareland.11.t:0 "Victory Against the Cockatrice"
 mareland.11.d:0 "While it wasn't doubted by any in High Command that we would achieve victory, the ensuing battles between the New Mareland Army Corps against ravenous Cockatrice hordes were still far more violent then anypony could have expected. Vanguard units who'd not experienced Cockatrices firsthoof were petrified. It was only after communications with forward groups were terminated that whole groups of New Marelander troops were discovered to be turned to stone. It was only through this that the threat Cockatrices posed were fully realised and heavier Divisions were called in to treat these natural menaces like a proper threat.\n\nWhile some causalities were suffered, the families of those lost to a stony death have been properly compensated and their fates. Thanks to the media, the masses knowing what happened to these poor souls has helped to build public support for what was initially seen as a fruitless and ridiculous request by the rural population."
 mareland.11.a:0 "Their deaths were not in vain."

 mareland.12.t:0 "Our Army Routs!"
 mareland.12.d:0 "Perhaps through our troops' lack of fighting experience or through logistical and communication issues in High Command our 'War' on the wild Cockatrices of New Mareland has been met with a resounding failure. The threat Cockatrices posed were severely underestimated by local forces which were assigned to eradicating these 'harmless pests', communications with these units were steadily lost in the brutal outback. These problems were blamed on lack of infrastructure initially but when search and rescue teams were sent out they too were soon to be lost as well.\n\nBy the time proper army Divisions were assigned to the task Cockatrice hordes and nests had already become accustomed to targeting ponies and due to such dispatched troops were placed under heavy and ruthless assault by these monster birds.\n\nThe cockatrice has successfully routed our forces and we shall need to regroup and properly address this threat if we are to save face once the free media leaks this to the population..."
 mareland.12.a:0 "How could this happen?!"

 mareland.13.t:0 "Gladmane Holds a Rally"
 mareland.13.d:0 ""[...] When the griffons come to our country, they do not come to help us. They come to take our jobs, benefit from our generosity. This is bad news folks and Jet Set has done nothing about it. They have no right to our wealth when New Marelander families are struggling to get by. That's why we're going to build a wall along the border. It's going to be a huge wall. Constantly watched by our best. No one gets in, it's going to be wonderful!"\n\nCampaigning out in the field, the businesspony known as Gladmane took his supporters for an emotional ride. His rally got everypony cheering some controversial things. Shouts like; "Build a wall!" and "Lock them up!" Weren't uncommon. Many weary ponies are clamouring for change. Gladmane seems to touch something fundamental in the ponies' hearts and his gap with the other candidates is decreasing rapidly."
 mareland.13.a:0 "The griffons have no right to New Mareland!"
 mareland.13.b:0 "We can't support him."

 mareland.14.t:0 "Kingfisher Speaks Out Against Big Business"
 mareland.14.d:0 "Quite the ruckus was raised today down in Southern New Mareland. Kingfisher set out on a vicious tirade against our failure to address the ongoing 'corruption' occurring in our oil and rubber industry. He made quite the threatening statements that if the government would not address the issue, he would himself. By the time the rally finally ended there were plenty of wild chanting regarding Bosses in oil and rubber markets; 'Down with black gold! Death to the Ivory Tower dwellers! We will not be ignored!'"
 mareland.14.a:0 "What would workers know about advanced economics?"
 mareland.14.b:0 "Big business is necessary for the economy's growth!"

 mareland.15.t:0 "The Appleaide Rally"
 mareland.15.d:0 "The Duke incited heavy public discourse today when he began to advocate his nationalist and protectionist reform ideas once again. The discourse quickly became a full on rally as local militia soon took part in the rally. Thankfully, law enforcement was ordered to disperse the rally and that was presumed to be the end of that.\n\n...At least that was what the local officials believed. The rally didn't remain scattered for long and soon gathered close by once again to continue listening to Duke's fervent ranting. Law enforcement was ordered once again to scatter the rally's participants and this time showed up in force to intimidate the militia ponies in the attendance. The Duke has since used this incident to his advantage in painting our administration in a bad light."
 mareland.15.a:0 "Maybe he's got the right idea after all..."
 mareland.15.b:0 "The Duke is a raving loon! To Tartarus with him!"

 mareland.16.t:0 "The Battle of East Street"
 mareland.16.d:0 "Gladmane and the Duke's supporters had a vicious public brawl today at East Street up in New Manehattan. Investigators failed to pin which side started the fight - regardless, citizens from both sides were killed in the violence. We cannot sit idly and let opposing groups murder each other right out in public - a call must be made on which group should be pinned as the perpetrators of this mess. The public at large in New Manehattan are up in arms over this and pinning one side will at least help soothe things over... hopefully."
 mareland.16.a:0 "Gladmane's worms were the cause of this!"
 mareland.16.b:0 "Arrest the Fascist pigs!"

 mareland.17.t:0 "Everything you Ever Thought you Could Know About Fascism"
 mareland.17.d:0 "A book by Duke Haygle, the leader of the controversial New Mareland Republican Fascist Party, was published today. A political treatise on Fascism, it shocked most of the population. The duke bluntly lays out his plans for New Mareland in just under 300 pages. The core of his argument is that only absolute unity in the state and military pride can save New Mareland from economic collapse and the threat of communism. One of his more controversial points, saying that New Mareland should get rid of anypony that isn't absolutely dedicated to New Mareland and her government, has caused many to openly call for a ban on his writings. Some of the more desperate and patriotic ponies, however, think that his plans are just what we need to get our nation back on track. The government now faces a decision to either ban or allow the duke's book."
 mareland.17.a:0 "This is a good read, keep it."
 mareland.17.b:0 "Purity tests? That's just, wrong. Ban it!"

 mareland.18.t:0 "Kingfisher Assassinated"
 mareland.18.d:0 "This morning, the divisive politician Kingfisher was shot whilst leaving a session of Congress. His attacker, Caramel Chock, was restrained by the police, but he was able to fire three shots of his revolver.\n\nKingfisher was rushed to Sunset University Hospital where he later died of his injuries.\n\nKingfisher's popularity was second only to his controversy. He was known as a bully and a tyrant and often had legal challenges thrown against him from politicians and businessponies. However, during his time as governor of Celestia, he radically changed the face of the state, changing it from one of the poorest and least developed into a vibrant community on its way to recovery."
 mareland.18.a:0 "There is a million sad hearts in the nation today."

 mareland.19.t:0 "Kingfisher's Share Our Wealth Programme"
 mareland.19.d:0 "The former governor of Celestia, Kingfisher, outlined his 'Share Our Wealth' programme in a speech on the radio today. He stressed that no one pony should hold an extreme amount of wealth compared to another and called for free education and generous grants to help support the poor. Understandably, this has proven to be extremely popular among the poor and middle classes, even some natives have turned out to support him.\n\nWith his popularity rising it is likely that he'll rise far within the government."
 mareland.19.a:0 "We could learn from him."

 mareland.20.t:0 "Rich-Set Model 1011"
 mareland.20.d:0 "Many in the stock market either feared the viability or outright dismissed car manufacturer Rich-Set Industries when compared to their competitors, Mustang and The Sunset. Some outright even proclaiming the Company wouldn't even get off the ground! In spite of such statements Rich-Set's recent exposition unveiled the Model 1011 that has turned the Stock Market on its head! Investors have begun rushing to buy up Rich Set stocks as word got out on the Model 1011's complete superiority to Mustang's Royal just released nearly a year ago.\n\nQuite the development for a company many wrote off as a failure! Rich-Set Industries looks 'set' to take a leading position in the automobile industry if the Model 1011 is just the beginning of their new line of top of the line cars."
 mareland.20.a:0 "Should I get one of those?"

 mareland.21.t:0 "Mustang Royal"
 mareland.21.d:0 "In an elaborate show conference in Sunset, Mustang, the car manufacturer, has released their latest car, the Royal. The car aims to make luxurious comfort available for the average pony. It had all the comforts that came with carriages in the past, but now with a powerful engine and an ingenious suspension. There is already a backlog of orders, as many New Marelanders flocked at the chance to drive their very own 'Royal'. This has caused the company to start hiring even more employees, much to the satisfaction of the Commonwealth Government."
 mareland.21.a:0 "It is a nice car."

 mareland.23.t:0 "The First Socialist Conference"
 mareland.23.d:0 "The Great Depression and the push for independence have awakened a leftist sentiment in the people of New Mareland. It is in these favourable times that the Communist Party of New Mareland holds its first conference. The ponies and griffons meet, not in a fancy conference hall, but in an abandoned harbour warehouse, to show solidarity with the plight of the working class. As the conference progresses, three factions have formed, each with their own agenda.\n\nLufty Star still leads the traditional wing of the Party, advocating a form of communism not unlike the one Stalliongrad has been practising. The Equalist faction under Blueberry Frost has more extreme ideas about Equality, arguing for a society without money and class. The third faction had drafted their own charter called Mareland Socialism, or Maresoc for short. Shocked gasps and protests are heard as these ponies explain their ideas for a truly stable society. Capitalism, they argue, can only be defeated by removing the entire system and rebuilding it from the ground up. Introducing new structures of government and reordering society to suit the party's wishes. As the event comes to a close, the excited delegates all cast their vote on the vision for New Mareland they support."
 mareland.23.a:0 "The Communist Party will lead the vanguard of the revolution."
 mareland.23.b:0 "The Equalists will unite us all in true harmony."
 mareland.23.c:0 "MARESOC is right. We can't trust the capitalists."

 mareland.24.t:0 "MARESOC Denounces the Socialist Alliance"
 mareland.24.d:0 "The supporters of MARESOC simply differ to much from the rest of the Socialist Alliance. They do not allow for compromise and seem to have lost all reason. Instead of banding together with their fellow allies in the left, they have decided to prepare for their final struggle alone. Should the government act on these threats?"
 mareland.24.a:0 "Leave the communists to solve their own problems."
 mareland.24.b:0 "Crack down on their supporters!"
 mareland.24.c:0 "We will make these troublemakers see the light of Equality one way or another..."

 mareland.25.t:0 "The MARESOC Coup"
 mareland.25.d:0 "Ponies in Sunset woke up to a strange radio broadcast this morning, with the broadcaster urging them to stay inside and declaring that all would be well soon. Many suspicious ponies went out anyway, discovering that the MARESOC movement had captured several government buildings, along with the radio broadcasting studios. A drama unfurled in the streets the following hours, as loyalist army units took back parliament by force. And when the sun reached its highest point, the army, police and pony volunteers had secured the capital. When the dust had settled, it seemed like the MARESOC coup had failed. It would not be so easy. In New Manehattan and New Hoofington, the support for the radical movement was much larger than the government anticipated and the cities fell to the revolution as ponies cheered for the rebels. Now, even as the MARESOC movement erects propaganda speakers in the north of the country, the loyalists prepare a counterattack. The battle for the future of New Mareland has begun."
 mareland.25.a:0 "We must stop these radicals!"
 mareland.25.b:0 "MARESOC is the future!"

 mareland.26.t:0 "End of the Civil War"
 mareland.26.d:0 "Loyalist army units march through the streets of New Manehattan, the stronghold of the MARESOC movement. The onlookers seem silent, as if they are unsure what to feel. As soldiers raid the building the MARESOC party has been using as their headquarters, they finally discover the full scope of their horrifying vision for the future. They were intent on brainwashing their entire population into some cult, giving them barely enough to stay alive, so they would remain loyal. Given enough time, they were sure this would completely erase all established concepts, even truth itself. The army leaders have ordered these documents to be archived in the most secure safe, to make sure no one ever again attempts these nightmarish plans. "
 mareland.26.a:0 "This is a victory for all peace-loving ponies!"

 mareland.27.t:0 "End of the Civil War"
 mareland.27.d:0 "Our brave volunteers have accomplished what was already inevitable! The ideals of MARESOC are victorious against the counterrevolutionaries. Sunset is ours and the oppressed workers cheer their liberators on. The Ministry of Plenty has decided on double chocolate rations to celebrate this joyous occasion!"
 mareland.27.a:0 "Weren't the rations halved a week ago?"

 mareland.28.t:0 "Purges Among the Left"
 mareland.28.d:0 "While the Communists and Equalists are our "allies" against capitalism, they lack vision and give in to capitalist ideals such as voting, equality and free choice. They do not understand that this will merely give room for the old order to manifest itself again. Therefore these concepts must be eliminated from pony consciousness.\n\nWhile it may be unsavoury if the capitalist press gets word of it, we must take action against such counterrevolutionary ideas. We will make key figures of the other factions disappear and convince others to join us. It is too late for them to stop us now, the end of history awaits."
 mareland.28.a:0 "Let us unite the left and mould it in our image."

 mareland.29.t:0 "The Coup"
 mareland.29.d:0 "We have readied our militias and have secured the 'loyalty' of many officials, reporters and police officers. We have eliminated those who caught wind of our exploits, who might have understood a glimpse of what we were truly planning. The time is ready to seize our future. It is time for MARESOC to rise. We will bring a new order to the chaos, so that no pony will ever think wrong thoughts again."
 mareland.29.a:0 "Now for the rest of the world."

 mareland.30.t:0 "The Birth of Our Nation"
 mareland.30.d:0 "After a long struggle we have finally won our chance to govern New Mareland. First, we had to convince those in the Communist Party of our ideals, which didn't go smoothly at first. They called us unpractical, radical and anarchist. But when we united, the ponies flocked to our ideals. Until we were strong enough to force a change in the government. The challenges left by the old unequal government are still there, but together, we will overcome them and emerge as each others true equals."
 mareland.30.a:0 "Come on, everypony. All together now..."

 mareland.31.t:0 "Banking with [From.GetNameDef]"
 mareland.31.d:0 "New Mareland possesses a banking system that can help our finances stay secure and have them grow. Their state has recently deregulated their finance sector and they offer this golden opportunity to us. The only price, a pledge of non-aggression. Shall we invest in them?"
 mareland.31.a:0 "An excellent idea!"
 mareland.31.b:0 "They won't get a single bit of gold from us!"

 mareland.32.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] Has Opened a Bank Account"
 mareland.32.d:0 "The griffons seem more open to business than we first believed. One of their states has decided to stock their reserves with us. They're actually giving us their money!"
 mareland.32.a:0 "Capitalism is great!"

 mareland.33.t:0 "Griffaroo Spotted"
 mareland.33.d:0 "A mix of excitement and unbelief spread through the wildlife enthusiasts in New Mareland today as a picture of the legendary Griffaroo was published. The beast, said to be a hybrid of a kangaroo and a griffon, was dismissed by experts as a folktale. Although the photographer swears the picture is authentic, the issue has divided experts. Until a specimen of the illusive species is caught, the Griffaroo will be a hotly debated issue in universities and cafe's alike."
 mareland.33.a:0 "Crikey!"

 mareland.34.t:0 "The Counter Revolution"
 mareland.34.d:0 "A military coup has occurred against MARESOC, by those soldiers we deemed loyal. Clearly, not everypony is under our effect yet. The rebels are led by General Candy Garden. They seem to be a collection of all who oppose us. This includes democrats, other communists and even the fascists. MARESOC is under attack and all ponies must defend the new state."
 mareland.34.a:0 "They shall not crush the revolution!"

 mareland.35.t:0 "The Situation in New Mareland"
 mareland.35.d:0 "The situation in New Mareland has troubled Equestria for some time now. No news has come from the former Commonwealth since a mysterious movement known as MARESOC took over. Until now. Panic and relief mixed together as we got word from overseas. Candy Garden, a loyal general, has started a rebellion against what they described as a system more evil then anyone in Equestria could even imagine. Should we should help our fellow ponies against the horrific tyranny of MARESOC?"
 mareland.35.a:0 "We must save the ponies of New Mareland!"
 mareland.35.b:0 "We sadly cannot help."

 mareland.36.t:0 "Equestria Allies With Us!"
 mareland.36.d:0 "Our cry for aid has not gone on deaf ears. Our friends in Equestria have not forgotten us and they have promised their aid will be on its way. Cheers of joy were heard all through our provisional headquarters when we received the news that our true friends had not abandoned hope. We just have to hold out that bit longer and all will be well again. We must succeed in defeating evil!"
 mareland.36.a:0 "We'll show them!"

 mareland.37.t:0 "Waltzing Muletilda"
 mareland.37.d:0 "Once a jolly swagmare camped by a billabong\nUnder the shade of a coolibah tree,\nAnd she sang as she watched and waited till her billy boiled:\n"You'll come a-waltzing Muletilda, with me."\n\nA poem by Banjo Swing has recently been put to music and is  spreading throughout the Commonwealth. It's being sung by New Marelanders from all walks of life and a campaign has started to make it the official national anthem.\n\nA product of the depression, Swagponies can often be seen roaming the countryside from station to station looking for work. Their plight has captured the hearts and minds of the ponies of New Mareland and the song has only brought them to the forefront of everypony's mind."
 mareland.37.a:0 "We shall embrace this song as part of our national spirit."
 mareland.37.b:0 "We must build a better tomorrow for all ponies!"
 mareland.37.c:0 "Communism is the only answer to liberate the workers from their plight."

 mareland.38.t:0 "The Battle Hymn of the Commonwealth"
 mareland.38.d:0 "Mine eyes have seen the glory of Celestia's sun;\nShe shines upon the orchard where the apples of wrath do grow;\nShe lets loose that fateful flare of her wonderful swift sword:\nHer truth is marching on.\n\nA song composed by New Manehattan poet Lyrical Hoofly has spread among the armed forces with many calling it the Battle Hymn of the Commonwealth. It describes the struggle to free the world from darkness and tyranny and to spread the light and joy of Celestia to all corners of the globe."
 mareland.38.a:0 "Glory, Glory, hallelujah!"

 mareland.39.t:0 "Hydroelectric Dam Built"
 mareland.39.d:0 "We have managed to build a great project with funds saved for public works. With the help of many previously unemployed ponies, we have constructed a hydroelectric dam. This marvel of engineering and endurance will stand as a testimony to our ingenuity. Cheap power for all!"
 mareland.39.a:0 "The water must flow."

 mareland.40.t:0 "Coltberley Nuclear Power Plant"
 mareland.40.d:0 "This morning, [Root.GetLeader] cut the ribbon of the world's first Nuclear Power Plant at Coltberley. The power plant provides the surrounding towns with 50 MW of electricity and there is plenty of room to expand. The opening of the plant is a sign of New Mareland's place in the world stage and it brings hope for a new, better, tomorrow."
 mareland.40.a:0 "Time for some glowing wine!"

 mareland.41.t:0 "Call Our Friends"
 mareland.41.d:0 "The ideas of Harmony are not lost yet. New Mareland isn't the only place where free souls enjoy their lives. We must now call our friends, all those we have made on our long journey as ponies. We will send them a message which they are sure to answer. A message about freedom, about love, about harmony. About how all of that has been destroyed in Equestria. And about us, those who will reclaim our home. If they will join us against evil, we might still make it, together with our friends. If we stand together, we will triumph over the dark forces that have taken our home."
 mareland.41.a:0 "Together for Victory!"

 mareland.42.t:0 "The Alliance Against Evil"
 mareland.42.d:0 "We have received a letter from New Mareland. In it was a long story about harmony, the magic of friendship and peace. Those are values we at least ascribe to. The letter tells of the horrors that have befallen Equestria. They ask on us, as their friends, to aid them in their darkest hour. Shall we answer the call and fight for what is good in this world?"
 mareland.42.a:0 "Yes, we will join!"
 mareland.42.b:0 "We have other things to worry about then evil."

 mareland.43.t:0 "First Shopping Mall Opened"
 mareland.43.d:0 "Today our first shopping mall has opened in New Manehattan, with a massive crowd present. Located somewhat outside the city centre, the huge indoor building houses all kinds of stores. It was opened by the major, who was visibly proud of the mall. It is a marvel to visit, and more entertaining for a day with the family than a stroll through the park. Everything a pony could desire can be found inside the huge building, for the right price."
 mareland.43.a:0 "This is a triumph to shopping!"

 mareland.44.t:0 "Midnight in New Mareland"
 mareland.44.d:0 "As news from Equestria came that Nightmare Moon had risen again, there were those that weren't quite as horrified. Some, especially the isolated batpony communities in our country, were excited. We had to balance a lot of factors, but we've decided to throw ourselves at the mercy of the former princess Luna. We've joined Nightmare Moon and we hope for her generosity as we enter a new dark age."
 mareland.44.a:0 "Our fate is in the Empress' hooves."

 mareland.45.t:0 "The Fate of New Mareland"
 mareland.45.d:0 "The ponies of New Mareland have seen reason and have decided to submit to us. Now we need to decide how to handle our new subjects. Jet Set, who was a supporter of Harmony, can be put in charge, given a chance to prove his loyalty, now to the moon instead of the sun. The Shadowbolt society could also be put in charge. They are an ancient secret society of many powerful ponies, who say they were founded by Lunar supporters during the first rise of Nightmare Moon. Thirdly we could send a general to rule the colony through martial law, this might upset the locals. Who should we put in charge of New Mareland?"
 mareland.45.a:0 "Jet Set can prove his loyalty."
 mareland.45.b:0 "The Shadowbolt Society will rule well."
 mareland.45.c:0 "We can't trust them. Send a bat."

 mareland.46.t:0 "Our Fate"
 mareland.46.d_jetset:0 "Jet Set keeps his job as Governor-General to a new regime. He promised to do his best for the ponies in this difficult time."
 mareland.46.d_shadowbolt:0 "The Shadowbolt Society steps out of the shadows. They are an ancient society of many of the wealthy and powerful. They received a letter from Nightmare Moon reminding them that failure to comply would result in their assets, including their heads, being seized by the state."
 mareland.46.d_bat:0 "Nightmare Moon has seen it fit to send a bat! This general has been tasked with leading us and shaping us into a loyal state. This may not have been what we wanted..."
 mareland.46.a:0 "Time to get to work."

 mareland.47.t:0 "Miners' Strike in [miners_state.GetName]"
 mareland.47.d:0 "The miners in [miners_state.GetName] have taken to the streets in protests today. Carrying signs and chanting pro-communist slogans, they prevented anyone or anything from entering or leaving their mines. While the protests have been peaceful so far, it is unclear if a compromise would be reached."
 mareland.47.a:0 "A peaceful protest is better than a bloody one."

 mareland.48.t:0 "The Red March"
 mareland.48.d:0 "Factory workers, the unemployed and the homeless took to the streets of Sunset today demanding the government to bring an end to our economic woes. Thousands of ponies marched up Commonwealth Avenue to the Commonwealth Congress only to stop peacefully in front of the police line. Several ponies were reported to have given flowers to the police officers as they sang communist folk songs and chanted for change."
 mareland.48.a:0 "We should make the world a better place."

 mareland.49.t:0 "Communists Open Food Banks"
 mareland.49.d:0 "The Socialist Alliance has set forth an initiative to open food banks for the poor in many major cities. This initiative has been welcomed with open hooves as ponies, even from the middle classes flock to the banks to feed their starving families. However, some argue that this is not an act of kindness, but one of malice designed to undermine [Root.GetAdjective] society. They even argue that the communist shouldn't have enough money for all that food."
 mareland.49.a:0 "Communists or not, this is a good idea."

 mareland.50.t:0 "New Trade Unions Form"
 mareland.50.d:0 "With our recent recognition of Stalliongrad, many ponies have flocked to socialist ideals. Where trade unions once were few and far between, it now appears that they're becoming all the rage. A petition has been presented to the government by many leading politicians and business owners including Gladmane demanding that the government take action against these unions. However, [Root.GetLeader] feels that a move would currently be unlawful."
 mareland.50.a:0 "Unions are good for the workers."

 mareland.51.t:0 "Miners Attacked in [miners_state.GetName]"
 mareland.51.d:0 "A peaceful miners strike turned violent today as the mine owners sent gangs of griffons at the workers. The griffons fell on them without mercy and soon the miners had dispersed. Photos of griffons clawing at innocent ponies plaster the front pages of today's newspapers and ponies have taken to the streets to demand that justice is brought towards the mine owners."
 mareland.51.a:0 "This barbaric act cannot go unpunished!"

 mareland.52.t:0 "General Strike Called"
 mareland.52.d:0 "The Socialist Alliance has called for a general strike today in protests of the government's lack of action to resolve or worsening economic issues. Across the nation, ponies have taken to the streets waving sings and red flags. So far, the protests have been peaceful, but it has brought the country to a standstill."
 mareland.52.a:0 "Strike! Strike! Strike!"

 mareland.53.t:0 "Factory Fire in [factory_state.GetName]"
 mareland.53.d:0 "Last night, a toaster factory in [factory_state.GetName] burned to the ground in what the police believe was an act of arson. Firefighters worked through the night to control the blaze, but little could be done. The attack has been met with quiet joy among its employees who have often called upon the government to shut it down amid reports of mistreatment and illegal working conditions. The police have yet to find the culprits and the investigation is ongoing."
 mareland.53.a:0 "The owner must be getting hot under his collar."

 mareland.54.t:0 "The Problem in New Mareland"
 mareland.54.d:0 "The problems in New Mareland have gotten worse ever since they partioned. A group called MARESOC is allegedly turning the country in some kind of tyranny, with ponies being starved on purpose. They even have started to mind control ponies to strip them of all their freedom. Equestria should do something, shouldn't it?"
 mareland.54.a:0 "We must free New Mareland from MARESOC's tyranny, no matter the cost."
 mareland.54.b:0 "We cannot do anything to help them."

 mareland.55.t:0 "The Problem in New Mareland"
 mareland.55.d:0 "Now that we have decided to help our ponies in New Mareland, we still have to decide on a course of action. Of course, we could strike MARESOC on our own, but that would involve a tricky invasion by sea. Our generals have advised us that we could also send a request for aid from nearby sympathetic griffons. Surely they want to stop the MARESOC movement as well."
 mareland.55.a:0 "We must strike soon to free our fellow ponies."
 mareland.55.b:0 "We should ask the griffons for help."

 mareland.56.t:0 "Equestria Plots Against Us!"
 mareland.56.d:0 "Our spies have uncovered interesting news. The ponies in Equestria, our ancient homeland, want to start a war against us. Apparently, they consider our policies against pony nature and horrifying. This calls for a massive propaganda campaign against Equestria, a nation that truly represents evil. Our citizens must know to fear and to hate everything Equestrian. They will know that we have always been at war with Equestria. They will forget we even came from them, because we are nothing like them and they will never desire peace with us."
 mareland.56.a:0 "We have always been at war with Equestria."

 mareland.57.t:0 "Equestria Wants Our Help Against MARESOC"
 mareland.57.d:0 "The ponies in New Mareland have been up to some troubling things lately. They have converted to some communist movement they call MARESOC, which apparently brainwashes them into some sort of hatred towards everything harmonious. Equestria, the homeland of the New Marelanders, has decided to intervene and stop their madness. They have asked us for our help. We could use this to our advantage, if we want."
 mareland.57.a:0 "We shall help bring an end to such a nightmare."
 mareland.57.b:0 "We shall help... for a price."
 mareland.57.c:0 "We want nothing to do with this."

 mareland.58.t:0 "[From.GetName] Will Help Us"
 mareland.58.d:0 "The griffons come to our aid, they have decided that the nightmare of MARESOC has to end. We can count on our friends."
 mareland.58.a:0 "Excellent!"

 mareland.59.t:0 "[From.GetName] Wants Land in Return"
 mareland.59.d:0 "The griffons want to help us, but they cite the imminent loss of life and money as reason that might concern their citizens. To quell opposition against the military intervention, they need the promise of land. This is of course nonsense, but they did formulate it in such a way that it doesn't look like an insult. Do we accept their demands?"
 mareland.59.a:0 "We must give them what they want."
 mareland.59.b:0 "No chance."

 mareland.60.t:0 "Equestria has Agreed to Our Terms"
 mareland.60.d:0 "Equestria has decided to accept our proposal. If we win this war, we will be compensated fairly."
 mareland.60.a:0 "Most fortunate."

 mareland.61.t:0 "Equestria Has Refused Our Demands"
 mareland.61.d:0 "The fools in Canterlot refuse our most fair demands. Guess they didn't need the help of our griffons. We'll see how it plays out then."
 mareland.61.a:0 "Their loss."

 mareland.62.t:0 "[From.GetName] Wants Our Land!"
 mareland.62.d:0 "It seems the forces of evil don't even want to fight us one versus one. Trying to secure every unfair advantage they can find, they have invited the griffons across our borders to join them in their crusade against the truth. All citizens must be ready to fight."
 mareland.62.a:0 "We've always been at war with [From.GetName]."

 mareland.63.t:0 "Operation Sunrise Freedom"
 mareland.63.d:0 "Equestria has send us the encoded message to prepare our troops. The war against MARESOC is about to begin. We shall strike down this soulless tyranny and liberate the ponies of New Mareland together."
 mareland.63.a:0 "To war!"

 mareland.64.t:0 "[From.GetName] Will Not Help Us"
 mareland.64.d:0 "The griffon state has refused our offer. They sympathised with our cause, but simply didn't dare spend the griffonpower and effort to fight such a battle. They wished us the best of luck in our endeavour, however."
 mareland.64.a:0 "Understandable."

 mareland.65.t:0 "Rename Sunset?"
 mareland.65.d:0 "With the success of the revolution, there has been talk among those closest to Blueberry Frost of renaming our capital city to something more fitting. Blueberry likes the idea of naming the city Starlight after the founder of Equalism, Starlight Glimmer. However, it has been suggested that because Starlight Glimmer was a traitor to the cause, they should name the city after Equalism's true champion, Blueberry Frost. Then again, we could just keep the old name."
 mareland.65.a:0 "Starlight is without a doubt the best."
 mareland.65.b:0 "I quite like Blueberry."
 mareland.65.c:0 "No. Sunset is the best. End of discussion."

 mareland.66.t:0 "New Mareland Requests A Guarantee"
 mareland.66.d:0 "A representative of the ponies of New Mareland, Equestria's breakaway colony, has arrived in [Root.Capital.GetName]. They say that their recently gained independence and freedom is threatened by griffon aggression, which evoked sympathy from our officials. They formally ask the River Coalition to guarantee their independence, to discourage their neighbours from making a move against them."
 mareland.66.a:0 "All ponies must stand together."
 mareland.66.b:0 "No. From so far away, there is nothing we can do."
 
 mareland.67.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] Guarantees Us"
 mareland.67.d:0 "Our envoy has returned from [From.GetName], the leading nation of the River Coalition. She has good news: They have formally guaranteed our independence and warned our neighbours from making any aggressive actions against us or our sovereignty."
 mareland.67.a:0 "We stand together against the griffon menace."
 
 mareland.68.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] Refuses To Guarantee Us"
 mareland.68.d:0 "Our envoy has returned from [From.GetName], the leading nation of the River Coalition. She has bad news: They have refused to guarantee our independence, stating that it would do nothing to dissuade our enemies because they are too far away. While they are not wrong, it also means they are not interested in developing our relationship further."
 mareland.68.a:0 "We didn't want their friendship anyways..."
 
 mareland.75.t:0 "The NMRFP Primaries"
 mareland.75.d:0 "Though we are quickly rising in the polls, our candidate for the upcoming Presidential Elections have yet to be found, thanks to a fundamental split in the party between two candidates. In fact, the NMRFP is split so evenly down the middle that a meeting between the two candidates has not produced a solution.\n\nSituation getting worse by the minute, the party has called for what amounts to the first primary election in the world. Thousands of voters will vote before the official election to determine who may become the first President of New Mareland.\n\nThe first candidate is Erbus, the 2nd Duke of Harvi. Determined to solve the griffon minority, by integrating and eventually assimilating the griffons into a larger Marelander identity. He has stressed complete independence, from all powers, griffon or pony in the region and abroad and is pledging to build up a large army to defend the same.\n\nThe other candidate in the race is the Governor of New Hoofington, Picket Fence. Having made his name on regular denounciations of griffons, he is arguing that griffons and ponies are naturally unsuited to live and mix together and that they should therefore be segregated into their own communities, under the doctrine of 'Separate but Equal'.\n\nNo matter what, there can however only be one candidate. And as the results began ticking in, one candidate secured a slim, but workable majority in the race."
 mareland.75.a:0 "Duke Haygle"
 mareland.75.b:0 "Governor Picket Fence"
 
 mareland.76.t:0 "The Filibuster"
 mareland.76.d:0 "Another day, another boring session. The Presiding Officer was clearly about to doze off as a single hoof flew up from the chamber. 'The Chair recognizes the Representative of New Hoofington'\n\nPicket Fence rose, stacks of books on the lectern. 'Thank you, Presiding Officer. Now, I know that this is a debate upon which a large amount of prestige and history rests. I would like to make clear, that this bill should not be passed through the chamber. Every place in this great nation has enacted legislation that makes it impossible for anyone to disrupt or intimidate a voter into hindering them from taking up their voting rights. I expect now to take up the reading of the laws of voting in every part of this place to detail this in greater shape.\n\nAppleaide: That any creature that tries, or succeeds, during an election to willfully hinder the voting of others shall be fined a maximum of 250 bits. That no creature shall attempt to influence the electoral process of any lawful election by threatens of, including but not limited to: Violence, withdrawal of commerce, withdrawal of debt, enforcing payment of debt and, or, discharge from employment, in addition to any threats of bringing civil or ciriminal action or any other threat of injury on life, body or limb, under the penalty of six months of confinement, and forfeiture of property.\n\nBucksbane: That no person may infringe in the process of voting in any lawful election of any kind, public or private, under penalty of 500 bits fine. That infringing the secrecy of the vote shall not be allowed in any shape or form, and that no creature shall make any attempt, successful or not, upon degrading, destroying, prohibiting or limiting the right to vote in any shape or form under the penalty of three months confinement. That attempting bribery, threats or any undue influence to dictate or control or alter the vote of a duly given and cast vote given at any election shall be prohibited on penalty of 500 bits fine. Canmarea: In any election in which...."

 mareland.77.t:0 "24 Hours Later"
 mareland.77.d:0 ""...and under the facts given in the current debate and session, as far as we have been informed by the Representative on the floor, we have a report, a report, the report that spells out our republic. For we have to be ever vigilant against overreach. Indeed, think of our system with the judges. An appeals judge, appointed by the Federal Government has a terrifying amount of power. Any judge in our nation can kick out a jury if they so please and say to any prosecutor 'I'm sorry, but you are out of time' and just kick the poor pony out. No, we need to make sure that any bill is limited in scope to what the federal government is meant to do. Any equine government must be like the old government. Governing limited to what the government does best, which is to ensure a fair society and , not a nursemaid state that hovers over the citizens, putting controls on everything. In effect, this would neuter parts of our most beloved constitution and amend it without even going through the proper processes. In closing, I will note that every part of this nation, from cities to states have laws to protect the voters. This idea, that a judge should have the right to determine that is a truly frightening thought. Mr. Presiding Officer, I began speaking about 25 hours ago. It has now come for the time that I conclude my speech in the last few minutes. I urge the chamber to kill this bill where it is and ensure that Sunset does not trample on the rights of everyone else. I, myself expect to vote against this bill. I want to extend my gratitude to my fellow Representatives and the officers for the patience that they have shown me in this long-winded speech. I am deeply grateful to the Representatives who have listened in, to the clerks and the attaches who made it possible for me to deliver my message. I will now give up the floor, and suggest the absence of a quorum.""

 mareland.78.t:0 "The Fence Address"
 mareland.78.d:0 ""Before I begin my talk with all of you, I want to thank the people who made this possible in the first place. I want to thank the voters in New Hoofington who gave the possibility for me to serve my country. This is a day upon which I have been given the honor to serve and make my case. I have said to your I stand for the ponies.\n\nI will protect the good ponies of New Mareland. Let us send a message to the slow and dim-witted nursemaids and hoverparents in Sunset that we can do for outselves. We have been blessed with a strong populace and a burgeoning land of resources. And it is high time that our promised land became ours for the taking. We should not have to grant more just because they are too lazy to work. No, ponies and griffons are naturally unsuited to mix in society and we must acknowledge that we are all, 'separate but equal'. It is better for all if griffons and ponies were segregated for all to come out ahead. It is time to get out of the shadow of civil rights, and walk forthrightly into the bright sunshine of States' Rights!" "

 ### BANDIT EVENTS ###
 eqc_bandit_event.1.t:0 "The White Claw Bandits Strike Again!"
 eqc_bandit_event.1.d:0 "The group of griffon terrorists known as the White Claw Bandits have struck again. Striking at daylight, they have attacked a civilian factory. The griffons either stole explosives from the army or somehow made their own. They managed to severely damage one of our civilian factories and the damage report estimates it will take us a lot of time and work to get the manufacturing plant back to normal operations. The public is outraged that the government is allowing the bandits to operate freely. The police is already putting extra investigators on the case and even working with the army on some parts of the incident. This must not stand!"
 eqc_bandit_event.1.a:0 "We must stop these criminals."

 eqc_bandit_event.2.t:0 "The White Claw Bandits Strike Again!"
 eqc_bandit_event.2.d:0 "Another troubling report. The White Claw Bandits had the audacity to attack a factory. The criminals sabotaged one of our military factories, somehow sneaking by the night guards and wreaking havoc on the machinery. All of them managed to escape into the night with the guards only finding out what happened when the damage was already done. The griffons must have scouted out the factory and recorded the patrols. Nevertheless, this is an unacceptable humiliation for the police and a big win for the bandits. We cannot let this continue!"
 eqc_bandit_event.2.a:0 "We must stop these criminals."

 eqc_bandit_event.3.t:0 "The White Claw Bandits Strike Again!"
 eqc_bandit_event.3.d:0 "The White Claw Bandits' mission seems to be to frustrate our state to the best of their abilities. This time the chickens attacked a defenceless bridge. The operation seems to be carefully planned and the griffons must have somehow acquired blueprints, since our reconstruction of the attack shows they placed explosives at weak points. Our detectives are still not quite sure how to track down the criminals' base of operations, but they are working day and night on this case. Reconstruction will take a lot of time and resources, but until it is complete, crucial traffic will have to take reroutes. We simply cannot leave these crimes of vandalism unanswered!"
 eqc_bandit_event.3.a:0 "We must stop these criminals."

 eqc_bandit_event.4.t:0 "Griffons Desert the Army"
 eqc_bandit_event.4.d:0 "During a field exercise with our new griffon recruits, something happened. During a night under the starry skies, a bunch of them sneaked away with all their equipment. We believe they've left the army to join the insurgents in the White Claw Bandits. This isn't an isolated case either, as the griffons have little enthusiasm to join the armed forces. It seems that to them a life as a criminal is preferable to that of an honest soldier. The army demands that the police steps up their efforts to track down the bandits!"
 eqc_bandit_event.4.a:0 "These deserters will be dealt with!"

 eqc_bandit_event.5.t:0 "The White Claw Bandits Escape!"
 eqc_bandit_event.5.d:0 "Our police officers report that the damned White Claw leadership has escaped our clutches. How they knew that we were on to their hideout remains a mystery, but when we got there, there was not a single soul in sight. The bandits left nothing of value in their hideout and our investigators failed to turn up a lead to where the criminals have fled to."
 eqc_bandit_event.5.a:0 "You can't hide forever!"

 eqc_bandit_event.6.t:0 "We've Captured the Bandit Leaders!"
 eqc_bandit_event.6.d:0 "Fantastic news reached us today. Our soldiers and officers are pleased to report that we captured the White Claw Bandits' leadership.  They realised too late we were nearing their hideout. Some of the bastards tried to escape, but we brought our fastest pegasi for this very reason. After a chase through the skies, with guns being fired by both sides, the rascals finally gave up. Now, with the heads of the movement in our custody, this will be the end of any sophisticated operations by the White Claw Bandits! The story of the Police versus the White Claw bandits will surely be something the police department will keep telling for generations to come."
 eqc_bandit_event.6.a:0 "Those officers deserve medals."

This was largely fuelled by an economic downturn and separatist sentiments. And now the communists have finally grown powerful enough to take over the country. Many ponies and griffons took to the street and Princess Celestia's portraits were burned in public. Cheering crowds flying red flags toppled statues of the pony monarch, without the police intervening. The Communist Party of New Mareland, who seemed to be behind the unrest announced that they were now the representatives of the ponies and griffons of New Mareland and hours later, they unilaterally announced their independence from Equestria, calling Celestia an oppressive tyrant."

A particularly radical socialist movement, these ponies got ostracised from the rest of the New Mareland communists after they didn't win the trust of enough delegates at their conference. They refused to compromise and instead prepared for an armed conflict. It appears that the New Mareland police didn't act against their influence soon enough and now they might pay the prize for their complacence. Who will turn up on top of the conflict is unclear as of yet, but analysts fear that this will be an especially bloody affair with both sides convinced of the utter evil of the other side."

What exactly the rebels were planning remains a mystery and New Mareland has released no comment on what else they have found in the city.

The extreme socialist movement has pledged to root out the old and replace it with a new system. MARESOC is reportedly already starting their first reforms to society.

While larger, heavier, and somehow even more annoying than the Equestrian Breezies, these tanks had similar performance."

 EQC_light_tank_equipment_2:0 "M2 Emu"
 EQC_light_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The M2 Emu was the result of work on the concept of a tank design that was 'convertible', or able to run on either treads or wheels. With heavier armor than the Cockatoo, and a cannon instead of only machine guns, it replaced the earlier design. Somewhat inferior to the Equestrian Muletilda, it was still relatively effective, if mechanically over-complicated, and the design concept was not developed further."

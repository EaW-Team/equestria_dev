 EQC_royal_visit:0 "The Royal Visit"

 EQC_school_for_gifted_unicorns:0 "New Mareland School for Gifted Unicorns"
 EQC_school_for_gifted_unicorns_desc:0 "Most Unicorns with a talent for magic leave New Mareland for Canterlot, to go to one of the prestigious schools there. This causes an unfortunate brain drain for us. Establishing our own academy for the study of the arcane would help our scientifically and magical foundation tremendously."
 EQC_school_of_friendship:0 "New Mareland School of Friendship"
 EQC_school_of_friendship_desc:0 "A School of Friendship, similar to the one near Ponyville in Equestria, could help to improve our relations with different countries tremendously. Such a school would also not be exclusive to Unicorns, unlike the other option currently on the table."


 #Equestrian Investment and Welfare
 EQC_equestrian_investors:0 "Equestrian Investors"
 EQC_equestrian_investors_desc:0 "New Mareland has always been an attractive target for investment, and recent tensions on the Griffonian continent have only solidified that, as many Ponies back in Equestria are anxious about their assets in Griffonia, and are willing to relocate them here. If we set up initiatives and simplify the process it could become quite profitable for us, especially since the well-known Rich family has shown interest."
 EQC_attract_immigrants:0 "Immigration Campaign"
 EQC_attract_immigrants_desc:0 "While New Mareland is not a small country by any means, we still have plenty of room for more.

 EQC_national_parks:0 "Parks and Recreation"
 EQC_national_parks_desc:0 "Instead of turning the vast swaths of unused lands into farmlands and industrial centers, we should turn them into great parks, under national protection and free from any outside influences.

 EQC_basic_incom:0 "Universal Basic Income"
 EQC_basic_incom_desc:0 "There is widespread poverty in New Mareland, especially in the big cities. One way to ease the burden on our citizens would be to institute a basic income system. This would ensure that nopony in New Mareland will have to go hungry or face other harsh financial choices."
 EQC_solidify_self_determination:0 "Partners, not Puppets"
 EQC_solidify_self_determination_desc:0 "We may have willingly bound ourselves to Equestria and the Princesses, but that does not mean we cannot be our own nation.

Our right to self-determination is sacred, even if we may not always make use of it."

 EQC_autarky:0 "Autarky"
 EQC_autarky_desc:0 "We have learned what reliance on others gives us. Economic depression and a shattered national spirit.

 EQC_seize_control_desc:0 "With the reforms we have implemented and by favoring our supporters in government promotions, we have accrued a lot of power in the executive and judiciary branches of government and key positions in the media.

 EQC_empower_the_army:0 "Empower the Army"
 EQC_empower_the_army_desc:0 "We shall empower the army into a larger goal in governance, normalizing a reduced form of martial law. By doing this we will be able to increase funding to the army, to increase the soldiers’ loyalty to the state.

From now on, the most patriotic citizens can sign themselves into voluntary servitude to the state. In exchange for their most honorable service, their families will gain a standard income and a tax break./n/nThis legion of flexibly usable laborers will surely help our economy and our other goals. Some ponies might say this sounds like slavery, but only through the state can there be any liberty, securing the independence of our state is the highest goal anypony can aspire to.

 EQC_nation_works_projects:0 "Working Patriots"
 EQC_nation_works_projects_desc:0 "With our new control over the state’s finance we can open limited funding to the new Working Patriots organization. They will recruit members from the workless and travel the nation constructing roads and other useful services. Whenever they do they will receive a federal payment.

That the funding for the Working Patriots comes at the cost of money for organizations that don’t require anything for the ponies they help, is just a necessary side effect."

 EQC_united_shadowworks:0 "United Shadow-works"

 EQC_a_deal_with_the_duce_desc:0 "In neighboring Wingbardy, a griffon named Giulio Beakolini has come to power with his PNF party. They are ideologically aligned with us and could serve as a useful ally. While he is a Griffon, the bird is known as a strong leader and a patriot. His ideology is more important to us than his lineage, at least for now. If the Duce will make sure his griffons don’t spill over into our land, we will tolerate working within his ‘Pact’."

 EQC_stand_against_griffons:0 "The Griffon Menace"
 EQC_stand_against_griffons_desc:0 "All of the Griffons on the continent are a danger to us. They conspire against the pure ponies of New Mareland at every turn and work to make us weak. Whether they call themselves followers of harmony, whether they consider some of their inbred ‘royal’ houses to lead them. If they are disgusting red or even pretend to follow in our hoof steps with their stinking claws, they all want to stab us in the back. Didn’t their foreign influence into our society create the economic crisis to begin with? We will not stand for their lies any longer.

 EQC_unite_the_left:0 "Unite the Left"
 EQC_unite_the_left_desc:0 "Now that the workers have chosen which faction they wish to lead them into the revolution, we must make sure to bridge the gap between those who still doubt our leadership.

 EQC_nationalize_industries:0 "Nationalize Industries"
 EQC_nationalize_industries_desc:0 "Our redistribution policy can’t stop with wealth. True oppression comes from a small elite owning the means of production.

 EQC_land_redistribution_desc:0 "We have already redistributed all of the wealth of our nation, but all our wealth comes from our soil itself. No pony and no griffon can claim what nature has given for free. All shall own the land and work what they need. All will gain what they deserve.

 EQC_negotiate_with_griffon_clans_desc:0 "With a bit of diplomacy, we might be able to make a deal with the various Griffon Clans. Griffon volunteers could help us expand the ranks of the army, without running the risk of upsetting the various Griffons within our borders."

This way we invest in the security of our airspace today and a better air force tomorrow."

 EQC_a_new_fighter:0 "Fighter Competitions"
 EQC_a_new_fighter_desc:0 "New Mareland is a nation full of innovators and on the aerial front Star Hunter is by far the most talented. On his own initiative he has held competitions for new fighter designs. These contests have resulted in blueprints that are very much ahead of their time.

 EQC_new_south_bales_air_warning_system_desc:0 "New South Bales lies but a few miles from Aquileia. This Griffon nation hasn’t been a good neighbor to us. In fact, the Aquileians have resented our presence since the first ponies landed in New Mareland so long ago. We should not be naïve and secure our citizens. In an event of attack, it is imperative that we have intelligence on enemy troop movements and plane formations. In order to achieve this, we shall install new radar systems near the straight to keep an eye on our northern neighbors."

 EQC_expand_air_defence:0 "Expand the Air Defence Network"
 EQC_expand_air_defence_desc:0 "In the event of an aerial threat, our major cities will be the biggest targets for enemy bombing raids.

 EQC_long_air_patrols:0 "Long Range Air Patrol"
 EQC_long_air_patrols_desc:0 "One plane that turns up to the battle is more useful than a thousand planes that can’t reach the mission area. Range is a critical strategic component of our aircraft and therefore we shall divert our research efforts into long range tactics for our air force. New fighter models based on bomber frames are a new innovation worth looking into. Meanwhile, more efficient engines and the cutting of any unnecessary weight will mean our birds can fly farther on one tank of fuel."

 EQC_scout_seas:0 "Scout the Seas"
 EQC_scout_seas_desc:0 "Our possible enemies could very well outclass us out in the Ocean, posing a threat to our coastal cities. Now that we invested in better engines, it will become viable to cover the oceans with specialized naval strike craft.

 EQC_bombardier_focus:0 "Fund Bombardier"
 EQC_bombardier_focus_desc:0 "Bombardier is a plan drawn up some of our rather radical air theorists. They posit that success in warfare is mainly based on industry and resources. Therefore, it is imperative that we design aircraft to specifically target the enemy’s production, instead of just making planes to support combat operations. A rifle that never gets built can’t kill a pony, after all. This numbers approach to warfare was called ‘cynical’ by some commanders, who were afraid that it may lead to large civilian casualties. Nevertheless, we will approve the plan. "

 EQC_special_air_fund:0 "Project Eldoran"
 EQC_special_air_fund_desc:0 "On the island of Eldoran, far removed from the mainland and any prying eyes, is our secret weapons testing ground.

 ### EVENTS ###
 mareland.1.t:0 "Make Peace with the Changelings?"
 mareland.1.d:0 "The War is turning rapidly in favour of the Changeling Empire. Further resistance is always possible, of course, but at this point, we must consider the possibility of seeking a seperate piece with the Changelings."
 mareland.1.a:0 "We must save ourselves."
 mareland.1.b:0 "We shall never give up on our fellow ponies!"

 mareland.2.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Seeks a White Peace"
 mareland.2.d:0 "Seeing the the circumstances of the war slowly turning against them, the Ponies in New Mareland wish to sign a seperate peace with us, in order to preserve their sovereignty. This would of course end the war with them much earlier than expected, and allow us to focus our attention to other matters. But we can hardly let them weasel out with a white peace, can we?"
 mareland.2.a:0 "They can have peace, for now."
 mareland.2.b:0 "Peace? Ha!"

 mareland.3.t:0 "The Changelings Reject our Offer of Peace"
 mareland.3.d:0 "This morning, we have received a communique from the Changeling Empire, in response to our offer of a seperate peace.\nIt seems that it was wishful thinking to hope that this request would be granted. The Changelings have reaffirmed their hostility to all Equestrian dependencies, and as such, they will finish the war, no matter the cost."
 mareland.3.a:0 "The Sea is our Wall."

 mareland.4.t:0 "The Royal Visit"
 mareland.4.d:0 "It has been almost a generation since a princess has visited New Mareland. We should offer an invitation to one of the Equestrian princesses to show the friendship between our nations.\n\nBut who shall we invite?"
 mareland.4.a:0 "Princess Celestia for the Summer Sun Celebration."
 mareland.4.b:0 "Princess Luna for Nightmare Night."
 mareland.4.c:0 "Princess Twilight to give a lecture."
 mareland.4.e:0 "Princess Cadance to meet charity workers."

 mareland.5.t:0 "The White Claw Bandits"
 mareland.5.d:0 "Just before dawn, an explosion echoed through Sunset. The source was a toaster factory at the edge of the city. Firefighters worked through the day to tackle the blaze but that didn't stop the police from beginning their investigations. It was indeed sabotage, and it wasn't long until the culprits where identified. Hours after the blast, a letter appeared on the desk of the New Mareland Chronicler's chief editor. It was from a group that called themselves the United Griffon Freedom Front, although the name White Claw Bandits has already been popularised by the tabloids.\n\nThese bandits claim that they object to the forced conscription of griffons into New Mareland's armies with the justification that they want no part in a pony's war and that it is in breach of the Native Freedoms Act of 912.\n\nJustified or not, these criminals have sworn to strike again and there is no knowing when they will stop."
 mareland.5.a:0 "We must bring them to justice!"

 mareland.6.t:0 "Ally with Griffons"
 mareland.6.d:0 "There are many Griffon states who share our communist ideas. But, sadly, they are divided and believe in spreading Communism in their own ways. We have chosen to seek friendship with one of these states, but in doing so we will unfortunately upset the others.\n\nWe must choose wisely, for the future of both New Mareland and the World Revolution is at stake."

 mareland.7.t:0 "The New Manehattan Explosion"
 mareland.7.d:0 "A huge explosion in the New Manehattan harbor shook the entire city, its blast heard by ponies all the way in Sunset. The New Manehattan Police Department reports that the explosion was an accident, caused by a collision of two ships. One was an empty cargo ship that was moving through the harbor, while the other one was an incoming ship carrying munitions.\n\nThe captain of the unfilled cargoship did not expect the munitions ship and couldn’t stop in time, even though it did throw out its anchor. The pointed bow of the vessel tore through the starboard side of the other ship. Despite desperate attempts of the crew to save the ship, fire reached the ammunition. The explosion that followed destroyed almost half of the New Manehattan harbor. Resources, ships and most importantly, almost two thousand souls were lost in the tragedy. Although some ponies were saved by rescuers, many more are still missing as the emergency services search the blast site. Meanwhile, firefighters are still fighting the raging fire in the port area.\n\nThe events in New Manehattan threw the entire country into mourning. The Harbormaster’s Office, which was outside of the blast radius, has been turned into a makeshift memorial. There, ponies from all over the city stop by to bring flowers and pay their respects to the victims of this tragic accident."
 mareland.7.a:0 "A terrible tragedy."

 mareland.8.t:0 "Something in the Deep"
 mareland.8.d:0 "A month ago, the SS Sunny Hauler, a [EQC.GetAdjective] cargo ship, vanished in the mid-Celestial Sea. While the search was extensive, it was deemed that the ship had sunk with all lives lost. That is, until this morning.\n\nA lifeboat washed up on the shores of the Great Cross. Inside was a pony identified as a crew member of the SS Sunny Hauler. He was highly agitated and lashed out at his rescuers. Eventually, they calmed down enough to recount their chilling tell.\n\nIt turns out that the SS Sunny Hauler had found themselves trapped in thick though at night, in the middle of the ocean. From their his account turned into one of incoherent ramblings about \"something in the water\" and \"the sweetest music ever heard\". Eventually, the crew of the ship turned their crewmates and brutally fought each other to the death.\n\nThe crewpony found themselves thrown overboard, adrift in the lifeboat. It was there they witnessed the something they could only describe as \"them\" rise from the waves to feast on what remained below dragging the ship below the sea. When as for more they could only answer with, \"they have returned.\""
 mareland.8.a:0 "We should watch the waters..."

 mareland.9.t:0 "Companies Demand BNPL Payment"
 mareland.9.desc:0 "With the end of the recent war, the companies we have issued BNPL bills to are now pushing for us to issue payments. They claim there is no longer any necessity to withhold payments 'for the good of the commonwelth'."
 mareland.9.a:0 "Very well."

 mareland.10.t:0 "The Second Cockatrice War"
 mareland.10.d:0 "There has been a growing call among the rural communities for the government to step in and help resolve the rampant issues with wild cockatrices. Claims have been made that the birds are gathering in large herds and ransacking farms and stations. Several compensation claims have been made for farm animals turning into stone, although, fortunately, there are currently no reports that ponies have been hurt.\n\nThey wish for drastic actions to be taken, ideally with military force. This raised some acknowledgment among the greater public due to the humiliating 'defeat' the New Mareland Army Corps suffered in what the media dubbed 'the Cockatrice War'. Several newspapers have already demanded that we get revenge against those birds!\n\nHowever, animal experts and the heads of the military have argued that there is no danger posed by the birds and that any military action will just be a waste of time and money."
 mareland.10.a:0 "We have better ways to waste time and money."
 mareland.10.b:0 "We shall show those birds who's boss!"

 mareland.11.t:0 "Victory Against the Cockatrice"
 mareland.11.d:0 "While it wasn't doubted by any in High Command that we would achieve victory, the ensuing battles between the New Mareland Army Corps against ravenous Cockatrice hordes were still far more violent then anypony could've expected. Vanguard units who'd not experienced Cockatrices firsthand were petrified. It was only after communications with forward groups were terminated that whole groups of New Marelander troops were discovered to be turned to stone. It was only through this that the threat Cockatrices posed were fully realised and heavier Divisions were called in to treat these natural menaces like a proper threat.\n\nWhile some causalities were suffered, the families of those lost to a stony death have been properly compensated and their fates. Thanks to the media, the masses knowing what happened to these poor souls has helped to build public support for what was initially seen as a fruitless and ridiculous request by the rural population.."
 mareland.11.a:0 "Their deaths were not in vain."

 mareland.12.t:0 "Our Army Routs!"
 mareland.12.d:0 "Perhaps through our troops' lack of fighting experience or through logistical and communication issues in High Command our 'War' on the wild Cockatrices of New Mareland has been met with a resounding failure. The threat Cockatrices posed were severely underestimated by local forces which were assigned to eradicating these 'harmless pests', communications with these units were steadily lost in the brutal outback. These problems were blamed on lack of infrastructure initially but when search and rescue teams were sent out they too were soon to be lost as well.\n\nBy the time proper army Divisions were assigned to the task Cockatrice hordes and nests had already become accustomed to targeting ponies and due to such dispatched troops were placed under heavy and ruthless assault by these monster birds.\n\nThe cockatrice has successfully routed our forces and we shall need to regroup and properly address this threat if we are to save face once the free media leaks this to the population..."
 mareland.12.a:0 "How could this happen?!"

 mareland.13.t:0 "Gladmane Holds a Rally"

 mareland.13.a:0 "The Griffons have no right in New Mareland!"
 mareland.13.b:0 "We can't support him."

 mareland.14.t:0 "Kingfisher Speaks Out Against Big Business"
 mareland.14.d:0 "Quite the ruckus was raised today down in Southern New Mareland. Kingfisher set out on a vicious tirade against our failure to address the ongoing 'corruption' occurring in our oil and rubber industry. He made quite the threatening statements that if the government would not address the issue, he would himself. By the time the rally finally ended there were plenty of wild chanting regarding Bosses in oil and rubber markets; 'Down with black gold! Death to the Ivory Tower dwellers! We will not be ignored!'"
 mareland.14.a:0 "What would workers know about advanced economics?"
 mareland.14.b:0 "Big business is necessary for the economy's growth!"

 mareland.15.t:0 "The Appleaide Rally"
 mareland.15.d:0 "The Duke incited heavy public discourse today when he began to advocate his nationalist and protectionist reform ideas once again. The discourse quickly became a full on rally as local Militia soon took part in the rally. Thankfully local Law Enforcement was ordered to disperse the rally and that was presumed to be the end of that.\n\n...At least that was what local Officials believed. The rally didn't remain scattered for long and soon gathered close by once again to continue listening to Duke's fervent ranting. Law Enforcement was ordered once again to scatter the Rally's participants and this time showed up in force to intimidate Militia members which had attended. The Duke has since used this incident to his advantage in painting our Administration in a bad light.."
 mareland.15.a:0 "Maybe he's got the right idea after all..!"
 mareland.15.b:0 "The Duke is a raving loon! To Tartarus with him!"

 mareland.16.t:0 "The Battle of East Street"
 mareland.16.d:0 "Gladman and the Duke's supporters had a vicious public brawl today at East Street up in New Manehatten. Investigators failed to pin which side started the fight, regardless citizens from both sides were killed in the violence. We cannot sit idly and let opposing groups murder each other right out in public..a call must be made on which group should be pinned as the perpetrator to this mess. The public at large in Manehatten are up in arms over this and pinning one side will at least help soothe things over..hopefully."
 mareland.16.a:0 "Gladmane's worms were the cause of this!"
 mareland.16.b:0 "Arrest the Fascist pigs!"

 mareland.17.t:0 "Everything you Ever Thought you Could Know About Fascism"
 mareland.17.d:0 "A book by Duke Haygle, the leader of the controversial Black Hooves Party, was published today. A political treatise on Fascism, it shocked most of the population. The duke bluntly lays out his plans for New Mareland in just under 300 pages. The core of his argument is that only absolute unity in the state and military pride can save New Mareland from economic collapse and the threat of communism. One of his more controversial points, saying that New Mareland should get rid of anypony that is, well, not a pony, has caused many to openly call for a ban on his writings. Some of the more desperate and patriotic ponies, however, think that his plans are just what we need to get our nation back on track. The government now faces a decision to either ban or allow the duke’s book.
 mareland.17.a:0 "This is a good read, keep it."
 mareland.17.b:0 "Pony purity? That’s just, wrong. Ban it!"

 mareland.18.t:0 "Kingfisher Assassinated"
 mareland.18.d:0 "This morning, the divisive politician Kingfisher was shot whilst leaving a session of Congress. His attacker, Caramel Chock, was restrained by the police, but he was able to fire three shots of his revolver.\n\nKingfisher was rushed to Sunset University Hospital where he later died of his injuries.\n\nKingfisher's popularity was second only to his controversy. He was known as a bully and a tyrant and often had legal challenges thrown against him from politicians and businessponies. However, during his time as governor of Celestia, he radically changed the face of the state, changing it from one of the poorest and least developed into a vibrant community on its way to recovery."
 mareland.18.a:0 "There is a million sad hearts in the nation today."

 mareland.19.t:0 "Kingfisher's Share Our Wealth Programme"
 mareland.19.d:0 "The former governor of Celestia, Kingfisher, outlined his 'Share Our Wealth' programme in a speech on the radio today. He stressed that no one pony should hold an extreme amount of wealth compared to another and called for free education and generous grants to help support the poor. Understandably, this has proven to be extremely popular among the poor and middle classes, even some natives have turned out to support him.\n\nWith his popularity rising it is likely that he'll rise far within the government."
 mareland.19.a:0 "We could learn from him."

 mareland.20.t:0 "Rich-Set Model 1011"
 mareland.20.d:0 "Many in the stock market either feared the viability or outright dismissed car manufacturer Rich-Set Industries when compared to their competitors, Mustang and The Sunset. Some outright even proclaiming the Company wouldn't even get off the ground! In spite of such statements Rich-Set's recent exposition unveiled the Model 1011 that has turned the Stock Market on its head! Investors have begun rushing to buy up Rich Set stocks as word got out on the Model 1011's complete superiority to Mustang's Royal just released nearly a year ago.\n\nQuite the development for a company many wrote off as a failure! Rich-Set Industries looks..'set' to take a leading position in the Vehicle Industry if the Model 1011 is just the beginning of their new line of top of the line cars."

 mareland.21.a:0 "It is a nice car."

 mareland.22.t:0 "The Commonwealth of New Mareland"
 mareland.22.d:0 "Over 500 years ago the first earth pony traders settled on the coast of Southern Griffonia and named their new home after Princess Celestia. Since then, years of immigration, colonisation and one-sided trade deals have resulted in the Commonwealth of New Mareland.\n\nWhile nominally still a part of Equestria, New Mareland has its own government in the Commonwelth Congress and is subject to its own laws and regulations. This de facto independence has led to many New Marelanders wishing to officially separate from Equestria and forge their own path ahead. The poor economic situation has not helped the matter.\n\nWhen the Griffon Empire fell, so did New Mareland's number one trade partner. The situation worsened when on the 29th October 999, the New Manehattan stock market crashed in what has become known as Black Wednesday. Equestria's lack of action in helping resolve the Great Depression that followed has caused resentment in many.\n\nThe times are changing, and New Mareland's future is uncertain. Will New Mareland survive the trials to come? Or will they become a footnote in history?"
 mareland.22.a:0 "Advance, New Mareland Fair!"

 mareland.23.t:0 "The First Socialist Conference"
 mareland.23.d:0 "The Great Depression and the push for independence have awakened a leftish sentiment in the people of New Mareland. It is in these favorable times that the Communist Party of New Mareland holds its first conference. The ponies and griffons meet, not in a fancy conference hall, but in an abandoned harbor warehouse, to show solidarity with the plight of the working class. As the conference progresses, three factions have formed, each with their own agenda./n/nLefty Pone still leads the traditional wing of the Party, advocating a form of communism not unlike the one Stalliongrad has been practicing. The Equalist faction under Blueberry Frost has more extreme ideas about Equality, arguing for a society without money and class. The third faction had drafted their own charter called Mareland Socalism, or Maresoc for short. Shocked gasps and protests are heard as these ponies explain their ideas for a truly stable society. Capitalism, they argue, can only be defeated by removing the entire system and rebuilding it from the ground up. Introducing new structures of government and reordering society to suit the party’s wishes. As the event comes to a close, the excited delegates all cast their vote on the vision for New Mareland they support."
 mareland.23.a:0 "The Communist Party will lead the vanguard of the revolution."
 mareland.23.b:0 "The Equalists will unite us all in true harmony."
 mareland.23.c:0 "MARESOC is right. We can't trust the capitalists."

 mareland.24.t:0 "MARESOC Denounces the Socialist Alliance"
 mareland.24.d:0 "The supporters of MARESOC simply differ to much from the rest of the Socialist Alliance. They do not allow for compromise and seem to have lost all reason. Instead of banding together with their fellow allies in the left, they have decided to prepare for their final struggle alone. Should the government act on these threats?"
 mareland.24.a:0 "Leave the Communists to solve their own problems."
 mareland.24.b:0 "Crack down on their supporters!"
 mareland.24.c:0 "We will make these troublemakers see the light of Equality one way or another..."

 mareland.25.t:0 "The MARESOC Coup"
 mareland.25.d:0 "Ponies in Sunset woke up to a strange radio broadcast this morning, with the broadcaster urging them to stay inside and declaring that all would be well soon. Many suspicious ponies went out anyway, discovering that the MARESOC movement had captured several government buildings, along with the radio broadcasting studios. A drama unfurled in the streets the following hours, as Loyalist army units took back parliament by force. And when the sun reached its highest point, the army, police and pony volunteers had secured the capital. When the dust had settled, it seemed like the MARESOC coup had failed. It would not be so easy. In New Manehattan and New Hoofington, the support for the radical movement was much larger than the government anticipated and the cities fell to the revolution as ponies cheered for the rebels. Now, even as the MARESOC movement erects propaganda speakers in the north of the country, the loyalists prepare a counterattack. The battle for the future of New Mareland has begun."
 mareland.25.a:0 "We must stop these radicals!"
 mareland.25.b:0 "MARESOC is the future!"

 mareland.26.t:0 "End of the Civil War"
 mareland.26.d:0 "Loyalist army units march through the streets of New Manehattan, the stronghold of the MARESOC movement. The onlookers seem silent, as if they are unsure what to feel. As soldiers raid the building the MARESOC party has been using as their headquarters, they finally discover the full scope of their horrifying vision for the future. They were intent on brainwashing their entire population into some cult, giving them barely enough to stay alive, so they would remain loyal. Given enough time, they were sure this would completely erase all established concepts, even truth itself. The army leaders have ordered these documents to be archived in the most secure safe, to make sure no one ever again attempts these nightmarish plans. "

 mareland.51.d:0 "A peaceful miners strike turned violent today as the mine owners sent gangs of griffons at the workers. The griffons fell on them without mercy and soon the miners had dispersed.

Firefighters worked through the night to control the blaze, but little could be done. The attack has been met with quiet joy among its employees who have often called upon the government to shut it down amid reports of mistreatment and illegal working conditions. The police have yet to find the culprits and the investigation is ongoing."

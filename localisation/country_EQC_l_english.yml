 EQC_strengthen_equestrian_ties_desc:0 "We may be New Marelanders, but we were all once Equestrians.

 EQC_royal_visit:0 "The Royal Visit"
 EQC_royal_visit_desc:0 "It has been almost a generation since a Princess of Equestria has visited New Mareland. We should offer an invitation to one of the four Equestrian Princesses to show the friendship between our nations, and strengthen our mutual bond."
 
 EQC_school_for_gifted_unicorns:0 "New Mareland School for Gifted Unicorns"
 EQC_school_for_gifted_unicorns_desc:0 "Most Unicorns with a talent for magic leave New Mareland for Canterlot, to go to one of the prestigious schools there. This causes an unfortunate brain drain for us. Establishing our own academy for the study of the arcane would help our scientifically and magical foundation tremendously."
 
 EQC_school_of_friendship:0 "New Mareland School of Friendship"
 EQC_school_of_friendship_desc:0 "A School of Friendship, similar to the one near Ponyville in Equestria, could help to improve our relations with different countries tremendously. Such a school would also not be exclusive to Unicorns, unlike the other option currently on the table."


 #Equestrian Investment and Welfare
 EQC_equestrian_investors:0 "Equestrian Investors"
 EQC_equestrian_investors_desc:0 "New Mareland has always been an attractive target for investment, and recent tensions on the Griffonian continent have only solidified that, as many Ponies back in Equestria are anxious about their assets in Griffonia, and are willing to relocate them here. If we set up initiatives and simplify the process it could become quite profitable for us, especially since the well-known Rich family has shown interest."
 
 EQC_attract_immigrants:0 "Immigration Campaign"
 EQC_attract_immigrants_desc:0 "While New Mareland is not a small country by any means, we still have plenty of room for more.

 EQC_land_grants:0 "Land Grants"
 EQC_land_grants_desc:0 "There is much unused land all over New Mareland.

Appropriating these lands for state use would allow us to properly develop and use them for the betterment of New Mareland."
 
 EQC_national_parks:0 "Parks and Recreation"
 EQC_national_parks_desc:0 "Instead of turning the vast swathes of unused lands into farmlands and industrial centres, we should turn them into great parks, under national protection and free from any outside influences.

 EQC_basic_incom:0 "Universal Basic Income"
 EQC_basic_incom_desc:0 "There is widespread poverty in New Mareland, especially in the big cities. One way to ease the burden on our citizens would be to institute a basic income system. This would ensure that nopony in New Mareland will have to go hungry or face other harsh financial choices."
 
 EQC_solidify_self_determination:0 "Partners, not Puppets"
 EQC_solidify_self_determination_desc:0 "We may have willingly bound ourselves to Equestria and the Princesses, but that does not mean we cannot be our own nation. There may yet come a day when we must part from Equestria. That day is not yet here, but we must be prepared for the possibility. Our right to self-determination is sacred, even if we may not always make use of it."

 EQC_fund_the_resistence:0 "Fund the Resistance"
 EQC_fund_the_resistence_desc:0 "The Enemy might have occupied our Home across the Sea, but there are still Ponies who actively resist their rule.

 EQC_open_banks_to_griffons_desc:0 "The griffons are swimming in money, but their constant wars mean that none of it is safe. We should offer a safe place for their money in exchange for protection. All we ask is a little and totally fair fee."

 EQC_trickle_down_economics:0 "The Trickle Down Theory"
 EQC_trickle_down_economics_desc:0 "Having the rich grow richer is good for everyone. By being rich, they can invest their money in more jobs for the poor. More jobs for the poor, the less poor there will be. Soon everypony shall be rich, but the rich will still be richer."

 EQC_break_up_monopolies_desc:0 "Monopolies are the enemy of fair competition and economic growth. We should take steps to ensure that no one organisation ever gains an unfair power in its field.

 EQC_president_of_the_downtrodden:0 "President of the Downtrodden"
 EQC_president_of_the_downtrodden_desc:0 "President Kingfisher has, ever since his inauguration, worked tirelessly to help those in need and now the nation is finally tasting the fruits of his labour.

As Kingfisher promised; It can happen here!"

 EQC_stand_against_communism:0 "Stand Against Communism"
 EQC_stand_against_communism_desc:0 "As we rebuild our great nation from the ashes of the old commonwealth, there is still a threat that looms across our borders. Although the bold ponies of New Mareland chose to rid themselves of the Red menace, many others have fallen to the vermin that corrupt the hearts of the poor. Now that New Mareland is a shining beacon for the hopeful, we shall make a stand against communism."

 EQC_no_south_griffon_commies:0 "Topple the Southern Communists"
 EQC_no_south_griffon_commies_desc:0 "Many old and noble countries in the south of the continent have either fallen to or are sympathetic towards communism. For our new society to succeed, we need to bring down these jealous states by any means necessary."

 EQC_kingfisher_neutrality:0 "Our Neutral Nation"
 EQC_kingfisher_neutrality_desc:0 "Why would New Mareland concern itself with the goings on in the rest of the world? Those who would throw us into terrible conflicts would only have us tie ourselves to some other power again. No!

 EQC_the_duke_wins:0 "The Duke Wins"

 EQC_build_now_play_later_desc:0 "It is imperative that we quickly build up our industry and for that we will need money and resources. For this, our industrial ministers have come up with the BNPL program, although it wasn’t intended to fund arms productions at first. We shall promise to pay the notes back later, after the economy has improved. Or when the Duke decides we have no need of our creditors’ support anymore."

 EQC_autarky:0 "Autarky"
 EQC_autarky_desc:0 "We have learned what reliance on others gives us. Economic depression and a shattered national spirit.

 EQC_seize_control:0 "Seize Control"
 EQC_seize_control_desc:0 "With the reforms we have implemented and by favouring our supporters in government promotions, we have accrued a lot of power in the executive and judiciary branches of government and key positions in the media. Our influence goes so far that we can use trials and fabricated scandals to get rid of those who speak out against us. Nopony can escape the Duke’s iron hoof now!"

 EQC_three_year_plan:0 "The Three-Year Plan"
 EQC_three_year_plan_desc:0 "To facilitate economic recovery and to prepare the economy for a state of war, we will have to implement a 3-year government austerity plan.

 EQC_empower_the_army:0 "Empower the Army"
 EQC_empower_the_army_desc:0 "We shall strengthen the army as a leading force, normalising a reduced form of martial law. By doing this we will be able to increase funding to the army. Furthermore, by giving them some policing duties, they get the chance to exercise against the disloyal parts of our citizenry, saving us the cost of prisons while giving the armed forces invaluable experience. Long live the Army! Long live New Mareland!"

 EQC_section_13:0 "Section 13"

 EQC_expand_the_stormponies_desc:0 "The Stormponies were a paramilitary organisation that was founded during our surge to power It is time to expand the Stormponies and give them a formal role in the government.

 EQC_work_for_the_nation:0 "Work for the Nation"
 EQC_work_for_the_nation_desc:0 "From now on, the most patriotic citizens can sign themselves into voluntary servitude to the state to reduce unemployment. In exchange for their most honourable service, their families will gain a standard income. These flexible labourers will surely help our economy. Some ponies might say this sounds like slavery, but only through the state can there be any liberty. Well that is what the propaganda will say."

 EQC_nation_works_projects:0 "Working Patriots"
 EQC_nation_works_projects_desc:0 "We can now fund the Working Patriots organisation. They will recruit members from the workless and travel the nation constructing roads and other useful services. This will surely attract the unemployed. That the funding for the Working Patriots comes at the cost of money for organisations that don’t require anything for the ponies they help, is just a necessary side effect."

 EQC_united_shadowworks:0 "United Shadow-works"
 EQC_united_shadowworks_desc:0 "Many high-ranking members of New Mareland's government are united in a society known as the Shadowbolt Society. While they have often spoken out against the Duke, this small ruling club could prove useful if brought under hoof."

 EQC_a_deal_with_the_duce_desc:0 "In neighbouring Wingbardy, a griffon named Giulio Beakolini has come to power with his PNF party. They are ideologically aligned with us and could serve as a useful ally. While he is a griffon, the bird is known as a strong leader and a patriot. His ideology is more important to us than his lineage, at least for now. If the Duce will make sure his griffons don’t spill over into our land, we will tolerate working within his ‘Pact’."

 EQC_stand_against_griffons:0 "The Griffon Menace"
 EQC_stand_against_griffons_desc:0 "All of the griffons on the continent are a danger to us. They conspire against the pure ponies of New Mareland at every turn. Whether they call themselves followers of harmony, if they are disgusting red or even pretend to follow in our hoof steps with their stinking claws, they all want to stab us in the back. Ponykind will resist the griffons’ disgusting influences and bring them all down!"

 EQC_war_with_aquilieia:0 "War with Aquileia"
 EQC_war_with_aquilieia_desc:0 "The time has come to deal with those bothersome Aquileians to the North.

No matter, we will give them a common enemy and soon they will have no nation left to fight over."

 #Communism!
 EQC_recognise_stalliongrad:0 "Recognise Stalliongrad"
 EQC_recognise_stalliongrad_desc:0 "Equestria refuses to recognise Stalliongrad as an independent nation. If we want our own freedom, wouldn't it be hypocritical if we did not make friends with our fellow freedom-loving ponies?"

 EQC_form_communist_unions:0 "Form Communist Unions"
 EQC_form_communist_unions_desc:0 "In order to gain autonomy, we need to reduce our dependency on Equestria. By forming self-regulating worker unions, we can remove our industrial addiction to Equestrian goods, while teaching our citizens the benefits of self-rule. Surely this will only reinforce their democratic ideals."

 EQC_unite_the_left:0 "Unite the Left"
 EQC_unite_the_left_desc:0 "Now that the workers have chosen which faction they wish to lead them into the revolution, we must make sure to bridge the gap between those who still doubt our leadership.

 EQC_burn_celestias_portrait_desc:0 "The people have chosen! We are a workers’ state for the people! No longer will we sit down and be oppressed by distant monarchs! Born the portrait of those who live in palaces while we suffer overseas! It is time ponies; our liberation is nigh."

 EQC_share_tech_stalliongrad_desc:0 "The socialist scientists of Stalliongrad have made great advancements, proof that socialism truly is the way of the future.

 EQC_true_workers_paradise:0 "A True Workers' Paradise"
 EQC_true_workers_paradise_desc:0 "This land belongs to those who live on it! Those who plow the fields, those who work the factories and build her cities. Now that we are free, we will make sure every worker gets what they deserve for their labour. We will commit to a workers’ paradise for all ponies and griffons. With our sweat and tears, a brighter tomorrow is within our reach."

 EQC_commie_griffon_ally:0 "Unite with the Griffon Workers"
 EQC_commie_griffon_ally_desc:0 "The workers of New Mareland do not march alone! Some of our griffon comrades have taken up arms to overthrow their corrupt capitalist regimes as well. We shall prepare a formal request to ally with our griffon brothers and sisters. The continent is full of elitist nobles and fat bankers, but together, we can make a grand continental revolution for all of Griffonia!"

 EQC_brothers_in_arms:0 "Griffon revolutionary Integration"
 EQC_brothers_in_arms_desc:0 "Many of the griffons in our nation are from the nations of Griffonia that have accepted the revolution.

 EQC_redistribute_wealth:0 "Redistribute the Wealth"
 EQC_redistribute_wealth_desc:0 "The old New Mareland had outrageous wealth inequality. Those that unjustly fed on the fruits of our labour will now work alongside of us as equals and earn their keep. The party has revealed an ambitious plan to completely redistribute all of the wealth in our nation to those who deserve it. You. The people."

 EQC_nationalize_industries:0 "Nationalise Industries"
 EQC_nationalize_industries_desc:0 "Our redistribution policy can’t stop with wealth. True oppression comes from a small elite owning the means of production. We must nationalise the key industries in our nation to pave the way to a more equal future. As an added benefit these industrial centres can now work for national goals instead of private ones, freeing up a lot of industrial capacity."

 EQC_free_education:0 "Free Education"
 EQC_free_education_desc:0 "Education is the great equaliser in society. It lifts up the impoverished into knowledge and welfare. All of us will benefit when every pony and every griffon get to take full advantage of our schools and universities. For the future, this means we can conduct more experiments in parallel."

 EQC_land_redistribution:0 "Land Redistribution"
 EQC_land_redistribution_desc:0 "We have already redistributed all of the wealth of our nation, but all our wealth comes from our soil itself. No pony and no griffon can claim what nature has given for free. All shall own the land and work what they need. All will gain what they deserve.

 ### EVENTS ###
 mareland.1.t:0 "Make Peace with the Changelings?"
 mareland.1.d:0 "The War is turning rapidly in favour of the Changeling Empire. Further resistance is always possible, of course, but at this point, we must consider the possibility of seeking a separate piece with the Changelings."
 mareland.1.a:0 "We must save ourselves."
 mareland.1.b:0 "We shall never give up on our fellow ponies!"

 mareland.2.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Seeks a White Peace"
 mareland.2.d:0 "Seeing the the circumstances of the war slowly turning against them, the Ponies in New Mareland wish to sign a separate peace with us, in order to preserve their sovereignty. This would of course end the war with them much earlier than expected, and allow us to focus our attention to other matters. But we can hardly let them weasel out with a white peace, can we?"
 mareland.2.a:0 "They can have peace, for now."
 mareland.2.b:0 "Peace? Ha!"

 mareland.3.t:0 "The Changelings Reject our Offer of Peace"
 mareland.3.d:0 "This morning, we have received a communique from the Changeling Empire, in response to our offer of a separate peace.\nIt seems that it was wishful thinking to hope that this request would be granted. The Changelings have reaffirmed their hostility to all Equestrian dependencies, and as such, they will finish the war, no matter the cost."
 mareland.3.a:0 "The Sea is our Wall."

 mareland.4.t:0 "The Royal Visit"
 mareland.4.d:0 "It has been almost a generation since a princess has visited New Mareland. We should offer an invitation to one of the Equestrian princesses to show the friendship between our nations.\n\nBut who shall we invite?"
 mareland.4.a:0 "Princess Celestia for the Summer Sun Celebration."
 mareland.4.b:0 "Princess Luna for Nightmare Night."
 mareland.4.c:0 "Princess Twilight to give a lecture."
 mareland.4.e:0 "Princess Cadence to meet charity workers."

 mareland.5.t:0 "The White Claw Bandits"
 mareland.5.d:0 "Just before dawn, an explosion echoed through Sunset. The source was a toaster factory at the edge of the city. Firefighters worked through the day to tackle the blaze but that didn't stop the police from beginning their investigations. It was indeed sabotage, and it wasn't long until the culprits where identified. Hours after the blast, a letter appeared on the desk of the New Mareland Chronicler's chief editor. It was from a group that called themselves the United griffon Freedom Front, although the name White Claw Bandits has already been popularised by the tabloids.\n\nThese bandits claim that they object to the forced conscription of griffons into New Mareland's armies with the justification that they want no part in a pony's war and that it is in breach of the Native Freedoms Act of 912.\n\nJustified or not, these criminals have sworn to strike again and there is no knowing when they will stop."
 mareland.5.a:0 "We must bring them to justice!"

 mareland.6.t:0 "Ally with griffons"
 mareland.6.d:0 "There are many griffon states who share our communist ideas. But, sadly, they are divided and believe in spreading Communism in their own ways. We have chosen to seek friendship with one of these states, but in doing so we will unfortunately upset the others.\n\nWe must choose wisely, for the future of both New Mareland and the World Revolution is at stake."
 mareland.6.a:0 "[WNG.GetName]!"
 mareland.6.b:0 "[JER.GetName]!"
 mareland.6.c:0 "[GRW.GetName]!"
 mareland.6.e:0 "Wait, where did they go?!"

 mareland.7.t:0 "The New Manehattan Explosion"
 mareland.7.d:0 "A huge explosion in the New Manehattan harbour shook the entire city, its blast heard by ponies all the way in Sunset. The New Manehattan Police Department reports that the explosion was an accident, caused by a collision of two ships. One was an empty cargo ship that was moving through the harbour, while the other one was an incoming ship carrying munitions.\n\nThe captain of the unfilled cargo ship did not expect the munitions ship and couldn’t stop in time, even though it did throw out its anchor. The pointed bow of the vessel tore through the starboard side of the other ship. Despite desperate attempts of the crew to save the ship, fire reached the ammunition. The explosion that followed destroyed almost half of the New Manehattan harbour. Resources, ships and most importantly, almost two thousand souls were lost in the tragedy. Although some ponies were saved by rescuers, many more are still missing as the emergency services search the blast site. Meanwhile, firefighters are still fighting the raging fire in the port area.\n\nThe events in New Manehattan threw the entire country into mourning. The Harbormaster’s Office, which was outside of the blast radius, has been turned into a makeshift memorial. There, ponies from all over the city stop by to bring flowers and pay their respects to the victims of this tragic accident."
 mareland.7.a:0 "A terrible tragedy."

 mareland.8.t:0 "Something in the Deep"
 mareland.8.d:0 "A month ago, the SS Sunny Hauler, a [EQC.GetAdjective] cargo ship, vanished in the mid-Celestial Sea. While the search was extensive, it was deemed that the ship had sunk with all lives lost. That is, until this morning.\n\nA lifeboat washed up on the shores of the Great Cross. Inside was a pony identified as a crew member of the SS Sunny Hauler. He was highly agitated and lashed out at his rescuers. Eventually, they calmed down enough to recount their chilling tell.\n\nIt turns out that the SS Sunny Hauler had found themselves trapped in thick fog at night, in the middle of the ocean. From there his account turned into one of incoherent ramblings about \"something in the water\" and \"the sweetest music ever heard\". Eventually, the crew of the ship turned on their crew mates and brutally fought each other to the death.\n\nThe crewpony found themselves thrown overboard, adrift in the lifeboat. It was there they witnessed the something they could only describe as \"them\" rise from the waves to feast on what remained below dragging the ship below the sea. When asked for more they could only answer with, \"they have returned.\""
 mareland.8.a:0 "We should watch the waters..."

 mareland.9.t:0 "Companies Demand BNPL Payment"
 mareland.9.desc:0 "With the end of the recent war, the companies we have issued BNPL bills to are now pushing for us to issue payments. They claim there is no longer any necessity to withhold payments 'for the good of the Commonwealth'."
 mareland.9.a:0 "Very well."

 mareland.10.t:0 "The Second Cockatrice War"
 mareland.10.d:0 "There has been a growing call among the rural communities for the government to step in and help resolve the rampant issues with wild cockatrices. Claims have been made that the birds are gathering in large herds and ransacking farms and stations. Several compensation claims have been made for farm animals turning into stone, although, fortunately, there are currently no reports that ponies have been hurt.\n\nThey wish for drastic actions to be taken, ideally with military force. This raised some acknowledgement among the greater public due to the humiliating 'defeat' the New Mareland Army Corps suffered in what the media dubbed 'the Cockatrice War'. Several newspapers have already demanded that we get revenge against those birds!\n\nHowever, animal experts and the heads of the military have argued that there is no danger posed by the birds and that any military action will just be a waste of time and money."
 mareland.10.a:0 "We have better ways to waste time and money."
 mareland.10.b:0 "We shall show those birds who's boss!"

 mareland.11.t:0 "Victory Against the Cockatrice"
 mareland.11.d:0 "While it wasn't doubted by any in High Command that we would achieve victory, the ensuing battles between the New Mareland Army Corps against ravenous Cockatrice hordes were still far more violent then anypony could have expected. Vanguard units who'd not experienced Cockatrices firsthand were petrified. It was only after communications with forward groups were terminated that whole groups of New Marelander troops were discovered to be turned to stone. It was only through this that the threat Cockatrices posed were fully realised and heavier Divisions were called in to treat these natural menaces like a proper threat.\n\nWhile some causalities were suffered, the families of those lost to a stony death have been properly compensated and their fates. Thanks to the media, the masses knowing what happened to these poor souls has helped to build public support for what was initially seen as a fruitless and ridiculous request by the rural population.."
 mareland.11.a:0 "Their deaths were not in vain."

 mareland.12.t:0 "Our Army Routs!"
 mareland.12.d:0 "Perhaps through our troops' lack of fighting experience or through logistical and communication issues in High Command our 'War' on the wild Cockatrices of New Mareland has been met with a resounding failure. The threat Cockatrices posed were severely underestimated by local forces which were assigned to eradicating these 'harmless pests', communications with these units were steadily lost in the brutal outback. These problems were blamed on lack of infrastructure initially but when search and rescue teams were sent out they too were soon to be lost as well.\n\nBy the time proper army Divisions were assigned to the task Cockatrice hordes and nests had already become accustomed to targeting ponies and due to such dispatched troops were placed under heavy and ruthless assault by these monster birds.\n\nThe cockatrice has successfully routed our forces and we shall need to regroup and properly address this threat if we are to save face once the free media leaks this to the population..."
 mareland.12.a:0 "How could this happen?!"

 mareland.13.t:0 "Gladmane Holds a Rally"
 mareland.13.d:0 " “[...] When the griffons come to our country, they do not come to help us. They come to take our jobs, benefit from our generosity. This is bad news folks and Jet Set has done nothing about it. They have no right to our wealth when New Marelander families are struggling to get by. That’s why we’re going to build a wall along the border. It’s going to be a huge wall. Constantly watched by our best. No one gets in, it’s going to be wonderful!”\n\nCampaigning out in the field, the businesspony known as Gladmane took his supporters for an emotional ride. His rally got everypony cheering some controversial things. Shouts like; “Build a wall!” and “Lock them up!” Weren’t uncommon. Many weary ponies are clamouring for change. Gladmane seems to touch something fundamental in the ponies’ hearts and his gap with the other candidates is decreasing rapidly."
 mareland.13.a:0 "The griffons have no right to New Mareland!"
 mareland.13.b:0 "We can't support him."

 mareland.14.t:0 "Kingfisher Speaks Out Against Big Business"
 mareland.14.d:0 "Quite the ruckus was raised today down in Southern New Mareland. Kingfisher set out on a vicious tirade against our failure to address the ongoing 'corruption' occurring in our oil and rubber industry. He made quite the threatening statements that if the government would not address the issue, he would himself. By the time the rally finally ended there were plenty of wild chanting regarding Bosses in oil and rubber markets; 'Down with black gold! Death to the Ivory Tower dwellers! We will not be ignored!'"
 mareland.14.a:0 "What would workers know about advanced economics?"
 mareland.14.b:0 "Big business is necessary for the economy's growth!"

 mareland.15.t:0 "The Appleaide Rally"
 mareland.15.d:0 "The Duke incited heavy public discourse today when he began to advocate his nationalist and protectionist reform ideas once again. The discourse quickly became a full on rally as local Militia soon took part in the rally. Thankfully local Law Enforcement was ordered to disperse the rally and that was presumed to be the end of that.\n\n...At least that was what local Officials believed. The rally didn't remain scattered for long and soon gathered close by once again to continue listening to Duke's fervent ranting. Law Enforcement was ordered once again to scatter the Rally's participants and this time showed up in force to intimidate Militia members which had attended. The Duke has since used this incident to his advantage in painting our Administration in a bad light.."
 mareland.15.a:0 "Maybe he's got the right idea after all..!"
 mareland.15.b:0 "The Duke is a raving loon! To Tartarus with him!"

 mareland.16.t:0 "The Battle of East Street"
 mareland.16.d:0 "Gladmane and the Duke's supporters had a vicious public brawl today at East Street up in New Manehatten. Investigators failed to pin which side started the fight, regardless citizens from both sides were killed in the violence. We cannot sit idly and let opposing groups murder each other right out in public..a call must be made on which group should be pinned as the perpetrator to this mess. The public at large in Manehatten are up in arms over this and pinning one side will at least help soothe things over..hopefully."
 mareland.16.a:0 "Gladmane's worms were the cause of this!"
 mareland.16.b:0 "Arrest the Fascist pigs!"

 mareland.17.t:0 "Everything you Ever Thought you Could Know About Fascism"
 mareland.17.d:0 "A book by Duke Haygle, the leader of the controversial Black Hooves Party, was published today. A political treatise on Fascism, it shocked most of the population. The duke bluntly lays out his plans for New Mareland in just under 300 pages. The core of his argument is that only absolute unity in the state and military pride can save New Mareland from economic collapse and the threat of communism. One of his more controversial points, saying that New Mareland should get rid of anypony that is, well, not a pony, has caused many to openly call for a ban on his writings. Some of the more desperate and patriotic ponies, however, think that his plans are just what we need to get our nation back on track. The government now faces a decision to either ban or allow the duke’s book."
 mareland.17.a:0 "This is a good read, keep it."
 mareland.17.b:0 "Pony purity? That’s just, wrong. Ban it!"

 mareland.18.t:0 "Kingfisher Assassinated"
 mareland.18.d:0 "This morning, the divisive politician Kingfisher was shot whilst leaving a session of Congress. His attacker, Caramel Chock, was restrained by the police, but he was able to fire three shots of his revolver.\n\nKingfisher was rushed to Sunset University Hospital where he later died of his injuries.\n\nKingfisher's popularity was second only to his controversy. He was known as a bully and a tyrant and often had legal challenges thrown against him from politicians and businessponies. However, during his time as governor of Celestia, he radically changed the face of the state, changing it from one of the poorest and least developed into a vibrant community on its way to recovery."
 mareland.18.a:0 "There is a million sad hearts in the nation today."

 mareland.19.t:0 "Kingfisher's Share Our Wealth Programme"
 mareland.19.d:0 "The former governor of Celestia, Kingfisher, outlined his 'Share Our Wealth' programme in a speech on the radio today. He stressed that no one pony should hold an extreme amount of wealth compared to another and called for free education and generous grants to help support the poor. Understandably, this has proven to be extremely popular among the poor and middle classes, even some natives have turned out to support him.\n\nWith his popularity rising it is likely that he'll rise far within the government."
 mareland.19.a:0 "We could learn from him."

 mareland.20.t:0 "Rich-Set Model 1011"
 mareland.20.d:0 "Many in the stock market either feared the viability or outright dismissed car manufacturer Rich-Set Industries when compared to their competitors, Mustang and The Sunset. Some outright even proclaiming the Company wouldn't even get off the ground! In spite of such statements Rich-Set's recent exposition unveiled the Model 1011 that has turned the Stock Market on its head! Investors have begun rushing to buy up Rich Set stocks as word got out on the Model 1011's complete superiority to Mustang's Royal just released nearly a year ago.\n\nQuite the development for a company many wrote off as a failure! Rich-Set Industries looks..'set' to take a leading position in the Vehicle Industry if the Model 1011 is just the beginning of their new line of top of the line cars."
 mareland.20.a:0 "Should I get one of those?"

 mareland.21.t:0 "Mustang Royal"
 mareland.21.d:0 "In an elaborate show conference in Sunset, Mustang, the car manufacturer, has released their latest car, the Royal. The car aims to make luxurious comfort available for the average pony. It had all the comforts that came with carriages in the past, but now with a powerful engine and an ingenious suspension. There is already a backlog of orders, as many New Marelanders flocked at the chance to drive their very own ‘Royal’. This has caused the company to start hiring even more employees, much to the satisfaction of the Commonwealth Government."
 mareland.21.a:0 "It is a nice car."

 mareland.23.t:0 "The First Socialist Conference"
 mareland.23.d:0 "The Great Depression and the push for independence have awakened a leftist sentiment in the people of New Mareland. It is in these favourable times that the Communist Party of New Mareland holds its first conference. The ponies and griffons meet, not in a fancy conference hall, but in an abandoned harbour warehouse, to show solidarity with the plight of the working class. As the conference progresses, three factions have formed, each with their own agenda.\n\nLefty Pone still leads the traditional wing of the Party, advocating a form of communism not unlike the one Stalliongrad has been practising. The Equalist faction under Blueberry Frost has more extreme ideas about Equality, arguing for a society without money and class. The third faction had drafted their own charter called Mareland Socialism, or Maresoc for short. Shocked gasps and protests are heard as these ponies explain their ideas for a truly stable society. Capitalism, they argue, can only be defeated by removing the entire system and rebuilding it from the ground up. Introducing new structures of government and reordering society to suit the party’s wishes. As the event comes to a close, the excited delegates all cast their vote on the vision for New Mareland they support."
 mareland.23.a:0 "The Communist Party will lead the vanguard of the revolution."
 mareland.23.b:0 "The Equalists will unite us all in true harmony."
 mareland.23.c:0 "MARESOC is right. We can't trust the capitalists."

 mareland.24.t:0 "MARESOC Denounces the Socialist Alliance"
 mareland.24.d:0 "The supporters of MARESOC simply differ to much from the rest of the Socialist Alliance. They do not allow for compromise and seem to have lost all reason. Instead of banding together with their fellow allies in the left, they have decided to prepare for their final struggle alone. Should the government act on these threats?"
 mareland.24.a:0 "Leave the Communists to solve their own problems."
 mareland.24.b:0 "Crack down on their supporters!"
 mareland.24.c:0 "We will make these troublemakers see the light of Equality one way or another..."

 mareland.25.t:0 "The MARESOC Coup"
 mareland.25.d:0 "Ponies in Sunset woke up to a strange radio broadcast this morning, with the broadcaster urging them to stay inside and declaring that all would be well soon. Many suspicious ponies went out anyway, discovering that the MARESOC movement had captured several government buildings, along with the radio broadcasting studios. A drama unfurled in the streets the following hours, as Loyalist army units took back parliament by force. And when the sun reached its highest point, the army, police and pony volunteers had secured the capital. When the dust had settled, it seemed like the MARESOC coup had failed. It would not be so easy. In New Manehattan and New Hoofington, the support for the radical movement was much larger than the government anticipated and the cities fell to the revolution as ponies cheered for the rebels. Now, even as the MARESOC movement erects propaganda speakers in the north of the country, the loyalists prepare a counterattack. The battle for the future of New Mareland has begun."
 mareland.25.a:0 "We must stop these radicals!"
 mareland.25.b:0 "MARESOC is the future!"

 mareland.26.t:0 "End of the Civil War"
 mareland.26.d:0 "Loyalist army units march through the streets of New Manehattan, the stronghold of the MARESOC movement. The onlookers seem silent, as if they are unsure what to feel. As soldiers raid the building the MARESOC party has been using as their headquarters, they finally discover the full scope of their horrifying vision for the future. They were intent on brainwashing their entire population into some cult, giving them barely enough to stay alive, so they would remain loyal. Given enough time, they were sure this would completely erase all established concepts, even truth itself. The army leaders have ordered these documents to be archived in the most secure safe, to make sure no one ever again attempts these nightmarish plans. "
 mareland.26.a:0 "This is a victory for all peace-loving ponies!"

 mareland.27.t:0 "End of the Civil War"
 mareland.27.d:0 "Our brave volunteers have accomplished what was already inevitable! The ideals of MARESOC are victorious against the counterrevolutionaries. Sunset is ours and the oppressed workers cheer their liberators on. The inistry of Plenty has decided on double chocolate rations to celebrate this joyous occasion!"
 mareland.27.a:0 "Weren’t the rations halved a week ago?"

 mareland.28.t:0 "Purges Among the Left"
 mareland.28.d:0 "While the Communists and Equalists are our 'allies' against capitalism, they lack vision and give in to capitalist ideals such as voting, equality and free choice. They do not understand that this will merely give room for the old order to manifest itself again. Therefore these concepts must be eliminated from pony consciousness.\n\nWhile it may be unsavoury if the capitalist press gets word of it, we must take action against such counterrevolutionary ideas. We will make key figures of the other factions disappear and convince others to join us. It is too late for them to stop us now, the end of history awaits."
 mareland.28.a:0 "Let us unite the left and mould it in our image."

 mareland.29.t:0 "The Coup"
 mareland.29.d:0 "We have readied our militias and have secured the 'loyalty' of many officials, reporters and police officers. We have eliminated those who caught wind of our exploits, who might have understood a glimpse of what we were truly planning. The time is ready to seize our future. It is time for MARESOC to rise. We will bring a new order to the chaos, so that no pony will ever think wrong thoughts again."
 mareland.29.a:0 "Now for the rest of the world."

 mareland.30.t:0 "The Birth of Our Nation"
 mareland.30.d:0 "After a long struggle we have finally won our chance to govern New Mareland. First, we had to convince those in the Communist Party of our ideals, which didn’t go smoothly at first. They called us unpractical, radical and anarchist. But when we united, the ponies flocked to our ideals. Until we were strong enough to force a change in the government. The challenges left by the old unequal government are still there, but together, we will overcome them and emerge as each others true equals."
 mareland.30.a:0 "Come on, everypony. All together now..."

 mareland.31.t:0 "Banking with [EQC.GetNameDef]"
 mareland.31.d:0 "New Mareland possesses a banking system that can help our finances stay secure and have them grow. Their state has recently deregulated their finance sector and they offer this golden opportunity to us. The only price, a pledge of non-aggression. Shall we invest in them?"
 mareland.31.a:0 "An excellent idea!"
 mareland.31.b:0 "They won't get a single bit of gold from us!"

 mareland.32.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] Has Opened a Bank Account"
 mareland.32.d:0 "The griffons seem more open to business than we first believed. One of their states has decided to stock their reserves with us. They're actually giving us their money!"
 mareland.32.a:0 "Capitalism is great!"

 mareland.33.t:0 "Griffaroo Spotted"
 mareland.33.d:0 "A mix of excitement and unbelief spread through the wildlife enthusiasts in New Mareland today as a picture of the legendary Griffaroo was published. The beast, said to be a hybrid of a kangaroo and a griffon, was dismissed by experts as a folktale. Although the photographer swears the picture is authentic, the issue has divided experts. Until a specimen of the illusive species is caught, the Griffaroo will be a hotly debated issue in universities and cafe's alike."
 mareland.33.a:0 "Crikey!"

 mareland.34.d:0 "A military coup has occurred against MARESOC, by those soldiers we deemed loyal. Clearly, not everypony is under our effect yet. The rebels are led by General Candy Garden. They seem to be a collection of all who oppose us. This includes democrats, other communists and even the fascists. MARESOC is under attack and all ponies must defend the new state."
 mareland.34.a:0 "They shall not crush the revolution!"

 mareland.35.t:0 "The Situation in New Mareland"
 mareland.35.d:0 "The situation in New Mareland has troubled Equestria for some time now. No news has come from the former Commonwealth since a mysterious movement known as MARESOC took over. Until now. Panic and relief mixed together as we got word from overseas. Candy Garden, a loyal general, has started a rebellion against what they described as a system more evil then anyone in Equestria could even imagine. Should we should help our fellow ponies against the horrific tyranny of MARESOC?"
 mareland.35.a:0 "We must save the ponies of New Mareland!"
 mareland.35.a:0 "We sadly cannot help."

 mareland.36.t:0 "Equestria Allies With Us!"
 mareland.36.d:0 "Our cry for aid has not gone on deaf ears. Our friends in Equestria have not forgotten us and they have promised their aid will be on its way. Cheers of joy were heard all through our provisional headquarters when we received the news that our true friends had not abandoned hope. We just have to hold out that bit longer and all will be well again. We must succeed in defeating evil!"
 mareland.36.a:0 "We'll show them!"

 mareland.37.t:0 "Waltzing Muletilda"
 mareland.37.d:0 "Once a jolly swagmare camped by a billabong\nUnder the shade of a coolibah tree,\nAnd she sang as she watched and waited till her billy boiled:\n"You'll come a-waltzing Muletilda, with me."\n\nA poem by Banjo Swing has recently been put to music and is  spreading throughout the Commonwealth. It's being sung by New Marelanders from all walks of life and a campaign has started to make it the official national anthem.\n\nA product of the depression, Swagponies can often be seen roaming the countryside from station to station looking for work. Their plight has captured the hearts and minds of the ponies of New Mareland and the song has only brought them to the forefront of everypony's mind."
 mareland.37.a:0 "We shall embrace this song as part of our national spirit."
 mareland.37.b:0 "We must build a better tomorrow for all ponies!"
 mareland.37.c:0 "Communism is the only answer to liberate the workers from their plight."

 mareland.38.t:0 "The Battle Hymn of the Commonwealth"
 mareland.38.d:0 "Mine eyes have seen the glory of Celestia's sun;\nShe shines upon the orchard where the apples of wrath do grow;\nShe lets loose that fateful flare of her wonderful swift sword:\nHer truth is marching on.\n\nA song composed by New Manehattan poet Lyrical Hoofly has spread among the armed forces with many calling it the Battle Hymn of the Commonwealth. It describes the struggle to free the world from darkness and tyranny and to spread the light and joy of Celestia to all corners of the globe."
 mareland.38.a:0 "Glory, Glory, hallelujah!"

 mareland.39.t:0 "Hydroelectric Dam Built"
 mareland.39.d:0 "We have managed to build a great project with funds saved for public works. With the help of many previously unemployed ponies, we have constructed a hydroelectric dam. This marvel of engineering and endurance will stand as a testimony to our ingenuity. Cheap power for all!"
 mareland.39.a:0 "The water must flow."

 mareland.40.t:0 "Coltberley Nuclear Power Plant"
 mareland.40.d:0 "This morning, [Root.GetLeader] cut the ribbon of the world's first Nuclear Power Plant at Coltberley. The power plant provides the surrounding towns with 50 MW of electricity and there is plenty of room to expand. The opening of the plant is a sign of New Mareland's place in the world stage and it brings hope for a new, better, tomorrow."
 mareland.40.a:0 "Time for some glowing wine!"

 mareland.41.t:0 "Call Our Friends"
 mareland.41.d:0 "The ideas of Harmony are not lost yet. New Mareland isn’t the only place where free souls enjoy their lives. We must now call our friends, all those we have made on our long journey as ponies. We will send them a message which they are sure to answer. A message about freedom, about love, about harmony. About how all of that has been destroyed in Equestria. And about us, those who will reclaim our home. If they will join us against evil, we might still make it, together with our friends. If we stand together, we will triumph over the dark forces that have taken our home."
 mareland.41.a:0 "Together for Victory!"

 mareland.42.t:0 "The Alliance Against Evil"
 mareland.42.d:0 "We have received a letter from New Mareland. In it was a long story about harmony, the magic of friendship and peace. Those are values we at least ascribe to. The letter tells of the horrors that have befallen Equestria. They ask on us, as their friends, to aid them in their darkest hour. Shall we answer the call and fight for what is good in this world?"
 mareland.42.a:0 "Yes, we will join!"
 mareland.42.b:0 "We have other things to worry about then evil."

 mareland.43.t:0 "First Shopping Mall Opened"
 mareland.43.d:0 "Today our first shopping mall has opened in New Manehattan, with a massive crowd present. Located somewhat outside the city centre, the huge indoor building houses all kinds of stores. It was opened by the major, who was visibly proud of the mall. It is a marvel to visit, and more entertaining for a day with the family than a stroll through the park. Everything a pony could desire can be found inside the huge building, for the right price."
 mareland.43.a:0 "This is a triumph to shopping!"

 mareland.44.t:0 "Midnight in New Mareland"
 mareland.44.d:0 "As news from Equestria came that Nightmare Moon had risen again, there were those that weren’t quite as horrified. Some, especially the isolated batpony communities in our country, were excited. We had to balance a lot of factors, but we’ve decided to throw ourselves at the mercy of the former princess Luna. We've joined Nightmare Moon and we hope for her generosity as we enter a new dark age."
 mareland.44.a:0 "Our fate is in the Empress' hooves."

 mareland.45.t:0 "The Fate of New Mareland"
 mareland.45.d:0 "The ponies of New Mareland have seen reason and have decided to submit to us. Now we need to decide how to handle our new subjects. Jet Set, who was a supporter of Harmony, can be put in charge, given a chance to prove his loyalty, now to the moon instead of the sun. The Shadowbolt society could also be put in charge. They are an ancient secret society of many powerful ponies, who say they were founded by Lunar supporters during the first rise of Nightmare Moon. Thirdly we could send a general to rule the colony through martial law, this might upset the locals. Who should we put in charge of New Mareland?"
 mareland.45.a:0 "Jet Set can prove his loyalty."
 mareland.45.b:0 "The Shadowbolt Society will rule well."
 mareland.45.c:0 "We can't trust them. Send a bat."

 mareland.46.t:0 "Our Fate"
 mareland.46.d_jetset:0 "Jet Set keeps his job as Governor General to a new regime. He promised to do his best for the ponies in this difficult time."
 mareland.46.d_shadowbolt:0 "The Shadowbolt Society steps out of the shadows. They are an ancient society of many of the wealthy and powerful. They received a letter from Nightmare Moon reminding them that failure to comply would result in their assets, including their heads, being seized by the state."
 mareland.46.d_bat:0 "Nightmare Moon has seen it fit to send a bat! This general has been tasked with leading us and shaping us into a loyal state. This may not have been what we wanted..."
 mareland.46.a:0 "Time to get to work."

 mareland.47.t:0 "Miners’ Strike in [miners_state.GetName]"
 mareland.47.d:0 "The miners in [miners_state.GetName] have taken to the streets in protests today. Carrying signs and chanting pro-communist slogans, they prevented anyone or anything from entering or leaving their mines. While the protests have been peaceful so far, it is unclear if a compromise would be reached."
 mareland.47.a:0 "A peaceful protest is better than a bloody one."

 mareland.48.t:0 "The Red March"
 mareland.48.d:0 "Factory workers, the unemployed and the homeless took to the streets of Sunset today demanding the government to bring an end to our economic woes. Thousands of ponies marched up Commonwealth Avenue to the Commonwealth Congress only to stop peacefully in front of the police line. Several ponies were reported to have given flowers to the police officers as they sang communist folk songs and chanted for change."
 mareland.48.a:0 "We should make the world a better place."

 mareland.49.t:0 "Communists Open Food Banks"
 mareland.49.d:0 "The Socialist Alliance has set forth an initiative to open food banks for the poor in many major cities. This initiative has been welcomed with open hooves as ponies, even from the middle classes flock to the banks to feed their starving families. However, some argue that this is not an act of kindness, but one of malice designed to undermine [EQC.GetAdjective] society. They even argue that the communist shouldn’t have enough money for all that food."
 mareland.49.a:0 "Communists or not, this is a good idea."

 mareland.50.t:0 "New Trade Unions Form"
 mareland.50.d:0 "With our recent recognition of Stalliongrad, many ponies have flocked to socialist ideals. Where trade unions once were few and far between, it now appears that they’re becoming all the rage. A petition has been presented to the government by many leading politicians and business owners including Gladmane demanding that the government take action against these unions. However, [EQC.GetLeader] feels that a move would currently be unlawful."
 mareland.50.a:0 "Unions are good for the workers."

 mareland.51.t:0 "Miners Attacked in [miners_state.GetName]"
 mareland.51.d:0 "A peaceful miners strike turned violent today as the mine owners sent gangs of griffons at the workers. The griffons fell on them without mercy and soon the miners had dispersed. Photos of griffons clawing at innocent ponies plaster the front pages of today’s newspapers and ponies have taken to the streets to demand that justice is brought towards the mine owners."
 mareland.51.a:0 "This barbaric act cannot go unpunished!"

 mareland.52.t:0 "General Strike Called"
 mareland.52.d:0 "The Socialist Alliance has called for a general strike today in protests of the government’s lack of action to resolve or worsening economic issues. Across the nation, ponies have taken to the streets waving sings and red flags. So far, the protests have been peaceful, but it has brought the country to a standstill."
 mareland.52.a:0 "Strike! Strike! Strike!"

 mareland.53.t:0 "Factory Fire in [factory_state.GetName]"
 mareland.53.d:0 "Last night, a toaster factory in [factory_state.GetName] burned to the ground in what the police believe was an act of arson. Firefighters worked through the night to control the blaze, but little could be done. The attack has been met with quiet joy among its employees who have often called upon the government to shut it down amid reports of mistreatment and illegal working conditions. The police have yet to find the culprits and the investigation is ongoing."
 mareland.53.a:0 "The owner must be getting hot under his collar."

 mareland.54.t:0 "The Problem in New Mareland"
 mareland.54.d:0 "The problems in New Mareland have gotten worse ever since they portioned. A group called MARESOC is allegedly turning the country in some kind of tyranny, with ponies being starved on purpose. They even have started to mind control ponies to strip them of all their freedom. Equestria should do something, shouldn’t it?"
 mareland.54.a:0 "We must free New Mareland from MARESOC's tyranny, no matter the cost."
 mareland.54.b:0 "We cannot do anything to help them."

 mareland.55.t:0 "The Problem in New Mareland"
 mareland.55.d:0 "Now that we have decided to help our ponies in New Mareland, we still have to decide on a course of action. Of course, we could strike MARESOC on our own, but that would involve a tricky invasion by sea. Our generals have advised us that we could also send a request for aid from nearby sympathetic griffons. Surely they want to stop the MARESOC movement as well."
 mareland.55.a:0 "We must strike soon to free our fellow ponies."
 mareland.55.b:0 "We should ask the griffons for help."

 mareland.56.t:0 "Equestria Plots Against Us!"
 mareland.56.d:0 "Our spies have uncovered interesting news. The ponies in Equestria, our ancient homeland, want to start a war against us. Apparently, they consider our policies against pony nature and horrifying. This calls for a massive propaganda campaign against Equestria, a nation that truly represents evil. Our citizens must know to fear and to hate everything Equestrian. They will know that we have always been at war with Equestria. They will forget we even came from them, because we are nothing like them and they will never desire peace with us."
 mareland.56.a:0 "We have always been at war with Equestria."

 mareland.57.t:0 "Equestria Wants Our Help Against MARESOC"
 mareland.57.d:0 "The ponies in New Mareland have been up to some troubling things lately. They have converted to some communist movement they call MARESOC, which apparently brainwashes them into some sort of hatred towards everything harmonious. Equestria, the homeland of the New Marelanders, has decided to intervene and stop their madness. They have asked us for our help. We could use this to our advantage, if we want."
 mareland.57.a:0 "We shall help bring an end to such a nightmare."
 mareland.57.b:0 "We shall help... for a price."
 mareland.57.c:0 "We want nothing to do with this."

 mareland.58.t:0 "[From.GetName] Will Help Us"
 mareland.58.d:0 "The griffons come to our aid, they have decided that the nightmare of MARESOC has to end. We can count on our friends."
 mareland.58.a:0 "Excellent!"

 mareland.59.t:0 "[From.GetName] Wants Land in Return"
 mareland.59.d:0 "The griffons want to help us, but they cite the imminent loss of life and money as reason that might concern their citizens. To quell opposition against the military intervention, they need the promise of land. This is of course nonsense, but they did formulate it in such a way that it doesn’t look like an insult. Do we accept their demands?"
 mareland.59.a:0 "We must give them what they want."
 mareland.59.b:0 "No chance."

 mareland.60.t:0 "Equestria has Agreed to Our Terms"
 mareland.60.d:0 "Equestria has decided to accept our proposal. If we win this war, we will be compensated fairly."
 mareland.60.a:0 "Most fortunate."

 mareland.61.t:0 "Equestria Has Refused Our Demands"
 mareland.61.d:0 "The fools in Canterlot refuse our most fair demands. Guess they didn’t need the help of our griffons. We’ll see how it plays out then."
 mareland.61.a:0 "Their loss."

 mareland.62.t:0 "[From.GetName] Wants Our Land!"
 mareland.62.d:0 "It seems the forces of evil don’t even want to fight us one versus one. Trying to secure every unfair advantage they can find, they have invited the griffons across our borders to join them in their crusade against the truth. All citizens must be ready to fight."
 mareland.62.a:0 "We've always been at war with [From.GetName]."

 mareland.63.t:0 "Operation Sunrise Freedom"
 mareland.63.d:0 "Equestria has send us the encoded message to prepare our troops. The war against MARESOC is about to begin. We shall strike down this soulless tyranny and liberate the ponies of New Mareland together."
 mareland.63.a:0 "To War!"

 mareland.64.t:0 "[From.GetName] Will Not Help Us"
 mareland.64.d:0 "The griffon state has refused our offer. They sympathised with our cause, but simply didn’t dare spend the manpower and effort to fight such a battle. They wished us the best of luck in our endeavour, however."
 mareland.64.a:0 "Understandable."

 mareland.65.t:0 "Rename Sunset?"
 mareland.65.d:0 "With the success of the revolution, there has been talk among those closet to Blueberry Frost of renaming our capital city to something more fitting. Blueberry likes the idea of naming the city Starlight after the founder of Equalism, Starlight Glimmer. However, it has been suggested that because Starlight Glimmer was a traitor to the cause, they should name the city after Equalism's true champion, Blueberry Frost. Then again, we could just keep the old name."
 mareland.65.a:0 "Starlight is without a doubt the best."
 mareland.65.b:0 "I quite like Blueberry."
 mareland.65.c:0 "No. Sunset is the best. End of discussion."


 ### BANDIT EVENTS ###
 eqc_bandit_event.1.t:0 "The White Claw Bandits Strike Again!"
 eqc_bandit_event.1.d:0 "The group of griffon terrorists known as the White Claw Bandits have struck again. Striking at daylight, they have attacked a civilian factory. The griffons either stole explosives from the army or somehow made their own. They managed to severely damage one of our civilian factories and the damage report estimates it will take us a lot of time and work to get the manufacturing plant back to normal operations. The public is outraged that the government is allowing the bandits to operate freely. The police is already putting extra investigators on the case and even working with the army on some parts of the incident. This must not stand!"
 eqc_bandit_event.1.a:0 "We must stop these criminals."

 eqc_bandit_event.2.t:0 "The White Claw Bandits Strike Again!"
 eqc_bandit_event.2.d:0 "Another troubling report. The White Claw Bandits had the audacity to attack a factory. The criminals sabotaged one of our military factories, somehow sneaking by the night guards and wreaking havoc on the machinery. All of them managed to escape into the night with the guards only finding out what happened when the damage was already done. The griffons must have scouted out the factory and recorded the patrols. Nevertheless, this is an unacceptable humiliation for the police and a big win for the bandits. We cannot let this continue!"
 eqc_bandit_event.2.a:0 "We must stop these criminals."

 eqc_bandit_event.3.t:0 "The White Claw Bandits Strike Again!"
 eqc_bandit_event.3.d:0 "The White Claw Bandits’ mission seems to be to frustrate our state to the best of their abilities. This time the chickens attacked a defenceless bridge. The operation seems to be carefully planned and the griffons must have somehow acquired blueprints, since our reconstruction of the attack shows they placed explosives at weak points. Our detectives are still not quite sure how to track down the criminals’ base of operations, but they are working day and night on this case. Reconstruction will take a lot of time and resources, but until it is complete, crucial traffic will have to take reroutes. We simply cannot leave these crimes of vandalism unanswered!"
 eqc_bandit_event.3.a:0 "We must stop these criminals."

 eqc_bandit_event.4.t:0 "griffons Desert the Army"
 eqc_bandit_event.4.d:0 "During a field exercise with our new griffon recruits, something happened. During a night under the starry skies, a bunch of them sneaked away with all their equipment. We believe they've left the army to join the insurgents in the White Claw Bandits. This isn’t an isolated case either, as the griffons have little enthusiasm to join the armed forces. It seems that to them a life as a criminal is preferable to that of an honest soldier. The army demands that the police steps up their efforts to track down the bandits!"
 eqc_bandit_event.4.a:0 "These deserters will be dealt with!"

 eqc_bandit_event.5.t:0 "The White Claw Bandits Escape!"
 eqc_bandit_event.5.d:0 "Our police officers report that the damned White Claw leadership has escaped our clutches. How they knew that we were on to their hideout remains a mystery, but when we got there, there was not a single soul in sight. The bandits left nothing of value in their hideout and our investigators failed to turn up a lead to where the criminals have fled to."
 eqc_bandit_event.5.a:0 "You can’t hide forever!"

 eqc_bandit_event.6.t:0 "We've Captured the Bandit Leaders!"
 eqc_bandit_event.6.d:0 "Fantastic news reached us today. Our soldiers and officers are pleased to report that we captured the White Claw Bandits’ leadership.  They realised too late we were nearing their hideout. Some of the bastards tried to escape, but we brought our fastest pegasi for this very reason. After a chase through the skies, with guns being fired by both sides, the rascals finally gave up. Now, with the heads of the movement in our custody, this will be the end of any sophisticated operations by the White Claw Bandits! The story of the Police versus the White Claw bandits will surely be something the police department will keep telling for generations to come."
 eqc_bandit_event.6.a:0 "Those officers deserve medals."

 eqc_news.1.d:0 "An emergency session of New Mareland's Commonwealth Congress came to a close this morning with a vote of 150 to 76 in favour of seeking immediate separation of government from Equestria. This follows the collapse in negotiations between Equestria and New Mareland on the subject of New Mareland sovereignty and the poor economic situation that ravages the nation. The vote has been applauded by many as the first true step on the path of independence. The Governor General and many in the ruling UEP have remained mute on the matter."

 eqc_news.3.d:0 "This morning, [EQC.GetLeader] was sworn in as the first President of an independent New Mareland. The old Governor General had put himself on a new platform of not just the same but a keeping of New Mareland tradition and pride.

Despite his record, the ponies cheered him on as he took the oath of office."
 eqc_news.3.a:0 "We are united and free!"
 eqc_news.3.b:0 "Has anything really changed?"

 eqc_news.4.d:0 "This morning, [EQC.GetLeader] was sworn in as the first President of an independent New Mareland. As [EQC.GetLeader] took the stand he made a riveting and slightly understandable speech about how great the nation would become under his leadership. He promised the masses wealth by allowing the many the corporations of New Mareland to flourish with little government oversight. Despite his record, the people cheered him on as he took the oath of office."
 eqc_news.4.a:0 "Let's make New Mareland great!"
 eqc_news.4.b:0 "This sounds like a bad idea..."

 eqc_news.5.d:0 "This morning, [EQC.GetLeader] was sworn in as the first President of an independent New Mareland. During his inauguration, [EQC.GetLeader] caused alarm among his new security team after he stepped down from the podium and walked amongst cheering crowds of ponies, personally telling them that all New Marelanders should have a right to their own wealth and land. Always a populist, he roused the ponies to an ecstatic frenzy of cheers for him and boos against the big corporations that control their lives. Despite corporate opposition the nation cheered him on as he took the oath of office."
 eqc_news.5.a:0 "Every pony a princess!"
 eqc_news.5.b:0 "He may be harsh, but he gets the job done."

 eqc_news.6.d:0 "This morning, [EQC.GetLeader] was sworn in as the first President of an independent New Mareland. The former army general and political philosopher was a surprise victory with many of his opponents calling for a recount at the last moment. The police weere on high alert has his supporters filled the streets of Sunset.\n\nThe Duke gave a passionate speech about the future of New Mareland and its place in the world. Calling it a sleeping nation that had just awoken to find itself surrounded by sharks and vultures. His promise to make New Mareland and all New Marelanders strong was met by cheers from the crowd and cries of, 'Long live the Duke! Long live New Mareland!'"
 eqc_news.6.a:0 "Let us march forwards as one!"

Diplomatic relations between the two countries shall be officially established in the upcoming weeks, with a sight for the new Stalliongrad embassy having already been selected in Sunset.\n\nThe Equestrian ambassador has issued an official protest and has demanded that the New Mareland government retracts the announcement. Even going as far as threatening to relinquish the Governor General from his office."
 eqc_news.7.a:0 "We will work well with our new friends."

 eqc_news.8.d:0 "The little-known MARESOC movement launched a successful coup against the government of New Mareland. They seem to have risen in the shadows, coercing and bribing their way into a position to strike. When the government loyalists realised what was going on, they were already too late to stop the Communists. The MARESOC movement promises huge changes to society and has already started to close their borders. The world watches on."
 eqc_news.8.a:0 "This is a victory for all!"
 eqc_news.8.b:0 "Worrying."

 eqc_news.9.t:0 "New Mareland Denounces Celestia"
 eqc_news.9.d:0 "For some time now, communist movements have been growing in Equestria’s griffonian dependency. This was largely fuelled by an economic downturn and separatist sentiments. And now the communists have finally grown powerful enough to take over the country. Many ponies and griffons took to the street and Princess Celestia’s portraits were burned in public. Cheering crowds flying red flags toppled statues of the pony monarch, without the police intervening. The Communist Party of New Mareland, who seemed to be behind the unrest announced that they were now the representatives of the ponies and griffons of New Mareland and hours later, they unilaterally announced their independence from Equestria, calling Celestia an oppressive tyrant."
 eqc_news.9.a:0 "Down with the Princess! Long live the Revolution!"

The New Manehattan Police Department investigation shows that an empty freighter collided with a ship carrying munitions, which caused the latter to explode. The tragedy caused the deaths of 1950 souls, with rescue operations still underway. The events in New Manehattan threw the entire country into mourning. The Harbormaster’s Office has been turned into an impromptu memorial. There, ponies deliver flowers and pay their respects to the victims of this tragic accident."
 eqc_news.10.a:0 "The horror!"

 eqc_news.11.t:0 "Civil War in New Mareland"
 eqc_news.11.d:0 "Violence has erupted all over New Mareland as the country descends into the turmoil of civil war. The instigators are the MARESOC supporters. A particularly radical socialist movement, these ponies got ostracised from the rest of the New Mareland communists after they didn’t win the trust of enough delegates at their conference. They refused to compromise and instead prepared for an armed conflict. It appears that the New Mareland police didn’t act against their influence soon enough and now they might pay the prize for their complacence. Who will turn up on top of the conflict is unclear as of yet, but analysts fear that this will be an especially bloody conflict with both sides convinced of the utter evil of the other side."

 eqc_news.12.t:0 "The New Mareland Civil War Ends"

Their leadership was found dead in their headquarters, they seemingly preferred death over a trial. What exactly the rebels were planning remains a mystery and New Mareland has released no comment on what else they have found in the city. Nevertheless, many ponies in the country are celebrating the end of the oppressive regime and many outside the country breathe a sigh of relief that MARESOC was never allowed to fully roll out their plans."

 eqc_news.13.d:0 "The MARESOC movement claimed victory in the New Mareland Civil War. The final loyalist forces have been defeated and the country is firmly in control of the Communists. Their gamble paid off, at the cost of many lives. The extreme socialist movement has pledged to root out the old and replace it with a new system. MARESOC is reportedly already starting their first reforms to society. Many democratic observers have expressed their concern about the nature of the proposed changes, but right now, MARESOC seems to be going ahead with their plans unopposed. Only time will tell how New Mareland will change."
 eqc_news.13.a:0 "It's time to rewrite history."
 eqc_news.13.b:0 "A shroud of darkness has fallen over New Mareland."

 eqc_news.14.t:0 "Communists Seize Power in New Mareland"
 eqc_news.14.d:0 "The Equalists have taken control of the New Mareland government. The united left had grown in popularity recently, under the leadership of Blueberry Frost, a pony who preaches radical equality based on Our Town. A series of peaceful demonstrations and strikes finally led Jet Set to assess that the current government could not maintain its position. Rather than let it turn to a violent revolution, he allowed the Equalists to assume power. Blueberry Frost immediately announced the independence of New Mareland, in a speech in which she also outlined that her government would work to make every pony equal."
 eqc_news.14.a:0 "It's time for true equality!"
 eqc_news.14.b:0 "At least the revolution was bloodless."


### EQUESTRIA IN EXILE EVENTS ###

 eqsexile.1.d:0 "The Fall of Equestria has saddened all our hearts. With the capitulation of the Equestrian government, many ponies have fled to our shores. The most important of which was the Royal Family itself, arriving in one of the few warships of the Navy. Although the princess’s escape was a welcome piece of good news this has raised an important question.\n\nThe refugees have sent an official petition to us for a joint Equestrian-New Mareland government to be formed under the rule of Princess Celestia. The Princess herself, not wishing to antagonise any of her subjects, is silent on such matters. Although Princess Celestia is respected by almost all of us, a complete takeover would anger many citizens of New Mareland. How shall we proceed?"
 eqsexile.1.a:0 "We are all Ponies, and Celestia is our Princess."

Although the princess’s escape was a welcome piece of good news this has raised an important question.\n\nThe refugees have sent an official petition to us for a joint Equestrian-New Mareland government to be formed under the rule of Princess Luna. The Princess herself, not wishing to antagonise any of her subjects, is silent on such matters. Although Princess Luna is respected by almost all of us, a complete takeover would anger many citizens of New Mareland. How shall we proceed?"
 eqsexile.2.a:0 "We are all Ponies, and Luna is our Princess."
 eqsexile.2.b:0 "We are loyal to Her Majesty, but we have our rights."

 eqsexile.3.t:0 "The Resistance"
 eqsexile.3.d:0 "While we have cemented our rule over Equestria, there are those who still dare oppose us. While trivial at first, they have been growing bolder and striking out against us in an organised resistance. Until we can find and purge the source of these attacks, there is little we can do to prevent them."
 eqsexile.3.a:0 "Any resistance shall be severely dealt with."

 eqc_resistence_event.1.t:0 "The Resistance Sabotage an Arms Factory"
 eqc_resistence_event.1.d:0 "The Equestrian resistance grows ever bolder. They have sabotaged one of our arms factories, severely damaging it. If this doesn’t let it, they might pose a severe threat to our military production."

 eqc_resistence_event.2.t:0 "The Resistance Sabotage a Civilian Factory"
 eqc_resistence_event.2.d:0 "The Equestrian resistance has struck. They have set one of our civilian factories on fire, severely damaging the building. If we don’t take care of these rebels, they will keep up their deviance."
 eqc_resistence_event.2.a:0 "Hunt down these rebels."

 eqc_resistence_event.3.t:0 "The Resistance Sabotage State Infrastructure"
 eqc_resistence_event.3.d:0 "The resistance has attacked again. This time they have attacked a railroad bridge that was used to carry goods through the country. We have to repair the damage and make sure we do something about the resistance."

 eqc_resistence_event.4.t:0 "Resistance Members Captured"
 eqc_resistence_event.4.d:0 "Our security forces have tracked down some members of the Equestrian Resistance. With the help of some collaborators, we managed to find one of their cells and shut it down. This might buy us some time, but we still haven’t cut off the source of the attacks."
 eqc_resistence_event.4.a:0 "Lock them away for good."

 eqc_resistence_event.5.t:0 "The Withdraw from Equestria"
 eqc_resistence_event.5.d:0 "We have left Equestria. The resistance won't bother us anymore, but this means we won’t share in Equestria’s wealth and industry anymore. Perhaps this is for the best?"
 eqc_resistence_event.5.a:0 "Thank goodness."

 eqc_resistence_event.6.t:0 "The Destruction of the Resistance"
 eqc_resistence_event.6.d:0 "We have finally taken out the heart of the Equestrian resistance. New Mareland was coordinating their ponies from overseas. Now that we have captured their leaders, plans and information, we can crush what’s left of the resistance once and for all."
 eqc_resistence_event.6.a:0 "Good riddance."

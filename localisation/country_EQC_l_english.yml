 EQC_school_of_friendship_desc:0 "A School of Friendship similar to the one near Ponyville in Equestria could improve help to improve our relations with different countries tremendously. Such a school would also not be exclusive to Unicorns, unlike a school for gifted unicorns."

 EQC_equestrian_investors:0 "Equestrian Investors"
 EQC_equestrian_investors_desc:0 "New Mareland has always been an attractive target for investment, but recent tensions on the Griffonian continent have changed this slightly.

 EQC_attract_immigrants:0 "Immigration Campaign"
 EQC_attract_immigrants_desc:0 "New Mareland is not a small country by any means. Our current population is a lot lower than would be expected of a nation like ours.

 EQC_basic_incom:0 "Universal Basic Income"
 EQC_basic_incom_desc:0 "There is widespread poverty in New Mareland, especially in the big cities. One way to ease the burden on our citizens would be to institute a basic income system. This would ensure that nopony in New Mareland will have to go hungry or face other harsh financial choices."
